<h3 id="c23">論戰債問題之糾紛及其解决 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— 恒</p>
<p>自前年洛桑會議告成之後。賠欵問題。本已告一段落。惟戰債問題。則雖有去年世界經濟會議之集會。當事國迄未有切實之討論。至今依然成爲美國與歐洲各國間之懸案。就最近英國拒絶對美續付戰債之態度而觀。此一問題之解决除美國切實讓步外。别無他道可求。否則節外生枝。影響洛桑會議之决定。而使賠欵問題。重起波瀾。亦未可知。蓋洛桑會議之後。英法意比等國沿有紳士恊定之簽訂·其要旨云。德之債權國。若與其自身之債權國。對於債務問題。未得滿意之解决時·則對洛桑恊定不予批准。設遇此種不能滿意解决之情形發生時。則各締約國對德之地位。將一返於胡佛延付戰債命令之前。玩繹上列數語之涵義。可知英法之態度。在使戰債與賠欵。併爲一談。其意蓋謂賠欵旣因洛桑恊定而减削十分之九。則戰債亦當爲相當比例之削减。設戰債而不能獲得相當比例之削减。則洛桑定。不能發生效力。同時亦卽成爲廢紙。據此而觀。除美國讓步以外。戰債無解决之道。戰債不能解决。則洛桑會議之成效。亦必復歸消失。隨而重起賠欵問題之糾紛。寗非意中事耶。</p>
<p>自法理言。賠欵者。戰勝國向戰敗國所索之賠償金。而戰債則爲從事戰爭而向友邦所舉之債欵。兩者性質逈異。不能併爲一談。唯英法等國之對美戰債。能否視爲國際間尋常之經濟借欵。則不無疑間。蓋此等借欵。以軍火食糧爲大宗。其目的純在助友邦作戰之勝利。而其用途亦純在於破壞。自不能與生産性之借欵。相提而並論也。歐戰停後。英法等國多主勾銷戰債。而美國則堅持異議。結果遂使各國全部取償於德。造成賠欵與戰債不可分離之關係。故前時美國與歐洲各國所訂之戰債恊定。以多一九八七年爲最後淸償期限。而楊格計劃上各國規定德國淸償賠欵之期限。與此僅相差一年。意在以賠欵爲淸償戰債之唯一凖備。顯然可見。同時各國又使楊格計劃分賠欵爲二期。第一期之賠欵。除充各國之收入外。餘由各國作戰債之償付。至第二期之賠欵。則純作各國淸償戰債之用。此種期間之劃分。更使賠欵與戰債發生連帶之關係。於此而外。英法意比等國。在簽訂楊格計劃之頃。更與德國成立一種議定書。規定英法意比等國家。若與其自身之債權國商得核减戰債之辦法。則德之賠欵。亦得隨而核减。至此。賠欵戰債。益如輔車之相依矣。　　此種關係。美國亦深知之。故一九三一年。德國金融恐慌。籲請各國許其停付賠欵。胡佛卽毅然首先下令。停付戰債一年。良以戰債苟不停付。則賠欵勢難單獨停付也。以此而論。戰債苟不切實核减。則賠欵自難獨减。故洛桑恊定之能否獲得各國批准。尙在未定之天。胥視美國之態度以爲斷也。</p>
<p>美自歐戰而後。由債務呀一躍而爲絶大之債權國。旣爲絶大之債權國矣。猶欲高其關稅壁壘。不使歐洲之商品。侵入其市塲。旣得緊閉其國内市塲之門戶矣。復欲奮其雄厚之國力。以與凋敝已極之歐洲。爭海外之市塲。按諸經濟原理。債務國對於債權國之償債行爲。苟爲數不鉅。自可以現金支付。設或過鉅。則非藉國際貿易之出超不爲功。反之。債權國苟欲收回鉅額之外債。必須消納債務國之商品。否則亦必無法收回。惟自大戰以還。美國爲保護本國在大戰中過度擴張之工業計。旣不願犧牲海外之市塲。又不能消納歐洲各國之商品。如是而欲他國之淸償戰債。自屬不可能也。且美國借與歐洲各國之戰債。並非現欵。而多爲軍火與食糧等商品。按諸情理。美國所應冀望於其歐洲債務國者。亦不能不以商品爲限。不然。若旣不能容納。他人之商品。又不肯大削戰債之數量。則徒使戰債問題永爲不能解决之懸案而已。</p>
<p>世之經濟學者。每謂目今世界之不景氣。原因雖多。而賠欵戰債之作祟。實其犖犖大者。良以此二問題。一日不得適當之解决。則國際貿易。必無法調整。在資金枯窘之國家。固不能提高其購買力。卽資金充裕國家。亦不免同受貿易衰退放欵失利之害。故爲美國計。正應洞燭此種　結。速謀戰債之削之减。俾往年辛苦訂成之洛桑恊定。不再成爲廢紙。如是則有裨於世界經濟之回蘇。當不小也。</p>

<p>（二）根據一九三四年英法意德之備忘錄、進行談判、特别說明其必要、</p>
<p>（三）主張設置保安委員會、其組織及權力限於處理保安公約、</p>

<p>今晨三主要國代表團領袖商訂折中提案時、意國並未參加、此間消息靈通方面皆料此爲豫留地步、俾意國得於日後爲調解人計、意總代表阿樂錫前於調解薩爾問題、已獲成功、故最能勝和事老之任也、（八日路透電）</p>

<p>八步出口的貨物、都經由賀江出都城、都城是廣東的一個鎭、位處梧州下游、三水之上、賀江出産的貨物往往先到都城後、再上運至梧州或下至省港、在經濟上賀縣與廣東的關係異常密切、所以賀縣及八步的商業金融勢力、全握在廣東人手裏、更表徴的是這裏的商民祗用東毫（廣東鑄造）、西毫（廣西鑄造）反不受歡迎、說起廣西的貨幣來、這也是很有趣味的事情、原來兩廣都以毫洋（小洋）爲本位、毫洋就是我們在南方所習見雙角、每五枚値一銀元、而所謂「銀元」也者、反成爲虚本位的貨幣、毫洋在兩廣是具有法幣資格的、譬如我們要向人有借一千塊錢、如果要現洋時、他、就會給你五千個雙毫、否則你可以要省銀行發行的兌換劵、假如一定要袁頭洋或孫洋的話、那是必須到市塲去購買才能得到的、毫洋合大洋的市價、通常加水三角、低時或加水四五角不等、在廣西通行的毫子、共有兩類、一爲東毫、卽廣東省所通行者、民一至民十三年俱用、一爲西毫、爲桂省自行鑄造者、亦名嘉禾毫、僅有民十五·十六·兩年、此外尙有一種中山洋、民十八所鑄、惟廣西用毫子極爲麻煩、商民挑剔太甚、農民動受損失、如東毫僅一至九年通用本位、他們寗願負荷成百成千纍贅的銅元、而不願携帶輕而易舉的銀毫或鈔票、就是銅元、也是各自爲制、不相統一的、有的地方大銅元（當二十）與小銅元（當十）並用、且視爲同一單位（一大銅元等於一小銅元）、如邕寗等處是、也有的地方僅用大銅元、而小銅元僅當爲計算之單位者、（一大銅元値二十銅元）此則受格電歇「惡幣逐良幣」法則之支配、小銅元因之絶跡、如桂林等處是、也有的地方根本不用大銅元的、如梧州、然而也竟有小銅元價格高於大銅元、要三大銅元才換得二個小銅元的、如北流、此則因大銅元不甚通行、故價格反低也、銅元尙且如此、毫子更不必說、甲地之所通用者、乙地或不行使、丙地之所歡迎者、丁地反被拒絶、一般的說、西毫之成色較東毫爲良好、因西毫僅有十五·十六·兩年、私鑄及僞造者甚少、故特受桂省人民歡迎、但八步却是一個特殊的例外地方、八步商人對毫子之挑剔、遠較桂省他處爲馬虎、差不多的毫子、（指東毫）他們都可以用、但祇是不願行使西毫、這原因、據說是由二種條件所造成的、第一、八步的金融勢力全粤省人所支配、第二、廣西銀行的勢力、以前從沒有達到此地過、而西毫是由廣西銀行所發出來的、</p>
<p>廣西的貨幣制度、還算比較統一的省份、廣西省銀行發行的兌換劵、除極邊僻的鄕村外、各處都可通行、毫子與銅元、雖各地有其不同的行使習慣、但還沒有「各自爲政」的惡現象、祇是有兩種情形、我們認爲最可危懼的、第一就是廣西各鄕下的農民、依然以銅元爲本位、他們因爲過去受過兩次最大的敎訓、（民十年陸榮廷主政時、廣西銀行鈔票停兌一次、民十八年黃紹雄時又有一次）所以對於廣西省銀行發行的鈔票、懷有戒心、使用毫子、又因商舖挑剔過嚴、藉以牟利、所以結果寗願使用累贅的銅元爲一切交易的本位、而銅元跌價的影響、無形中已經使他們蒙受極大的損失了、第二是廣西毘連安南的鄰縣、交易都以法光爲本位、本國貨幣倒退爲輔幣地位、法光是安南通用的貨幣、這種法光在毘鄰安南縣境勢力是很大的、當地居民對法光都有十二分的信仰、廣西的貨幣反而要貼水、才能通用、這種惡現象、雖經廣西省政府三令五申的禁止、然其潛勢力似非一紙命令所可剷除也、</p>

<p>昨日晚們將李君提出的三問題，先將第一問題答覆了。因爲本報篇幅關係未能登完，今日仍將未完部份登出，並進而將第二問題第一部分加以討論，因爲今明兩日的討論多徧理論的分析，請讀者格外細心咀嚼。再本問題愈討論到以後，愈覺易懂。並有輝煌的例證，可供讀者生活的參攷。編者</p>
<p>生活過程本身的矛盾性是怎樣說的呢？這是說，一個人的生活不能離開他生活着的社會環境，他不能不受客觀社會存在的影響，同時他是一個肉人，也不能不受生理法則的支配。社會的矛盾性，於是决定了生活的矛盾　。以前的社會的矛看沒有近代社會來得大，所以古人的生活上矛盾的反映也比較和緩，就是因爲這個緣故。在封建社會制度下因爲有領主與農奴的矛盾，自然在人的頭腦内套形成兩種不同的思想的衝突、因爲封建道德提倡禁慾主義，在人的行爲方面會呈出道德與性慾的對立。這一切都是成爲衝突的形態，必然是明爭暗鬥的表現在人的行爲上。我們在封建制度下的文學中，看出了不少的可歌可泣兒女情長與道德風習衝突的活劇，這些故事的主人，他們的生活的矛盾有時臻至極點，因此輕生者不知多少。我們能說一個在禁慾主義下而犯奸淫的靑年男女爲不道德麽？我們如果站在科學的立塲來考察，我們並不覺得奇怪，不道德。我們只覺得很平常這類「犯罪」的靑年男女的生活上呈出的矛盾是「顧全道德呢抑滿足生理要求呢？」由這惹出的思想或行動上的矛盾，你可說是病態嗎？是出了常軌嗎？</p>
<p>自然，站在法律觀點說，又當另論。</p>
<p>人類的生活旣然是客觀社會存在的反映，社會愈矛盾，愈分裂，尤其在社會變動極混亂的今日、人類的生活也就愈複雜，愈矛盾，這不獨表現在思想方面，同時也表現在行動方面。這一切用不着說明，祇要我們回顧八十年前我們祖宗的生活與我們目前的一比，就可恍然大悟了。</p>
<p>以上答覆了李君提出的第一主題，說明了生活矛看現象是受生活過程本身矛盾性的規定這一點。以不當詳論現代生活上的矛看的三方面。</p>
<p>（三）爲什麽思想與思想會有矛盾</p>
<p>前面略已說過，生活的矛盾現象是生活過程矛盾的衝突的表現。生活是一種過程，是時時刻刻在變動，在發展的。構成這種變動，發</p>
<p>展的動力自然就是矛盾，而這矛看不過是社會與自然發展過程的反映，通過人類實踐的社會生活，主動的作用之後，成爲推動生活之流的戰鬥的力。</p>
<p>所謂思想與行動本來是不可分開的，思想本身原來也就是一種行動，把思想與行動對立起來，原就不是一種正確的看法。不過，因爲思想是一種潛藏的行動，不像行動的具體化，所以在形態上形成了兩個不同的方面。因爲由潛藏的行動到具體的行動推移的過程是冲激的過程，所以這二者間發而爲矛盾的現象了。再就所謂思想與思想間的矛看而言，亦不過是因爲思想也是一種進程，是時時在變化的，而促進思想變化的是映入人的思想内幾種不同的因素在衝突。行動與行動間的矛盾，其理亦然。恕不縷述。總之，本節的叙述，我們無意把這三方面截然的分開，其所以分開叙述者，乃求說明上的方便而已。讀者不要誤會它們間是彼此無關聯的。</p>
<p>首先，我們來解說思想與思想爲什麽會呈出矛盾的現象。</p>
<p>思想旣然不能停止在某一階段，它自然是要發展的，這裏就包含着：新的思想與舊的思想不能並存，不能不相冲激，因爲這種推移是要通過實踐的，社會的實踐反映到人的思想的，自然是形形色色，但任社會的實踐是如何複雜，錯綜，多樣，豐富，印入人的思想内，並不是像照像同原來一樣的一併收入。因爲人的思想本身有能動的作用，它具有接受某一影片，拒絶某一影片的能動的作用。這就是由於他的特殊生活條件。特殊的生活條件是構成一個人的思想發展的界碑。但這不是說思想走到這界碑就無路可走了，他仍可發展，不過，他先要毁滅這界碑。自然，思想達到毁滅界碑的過程時，他一定要經過千回百次的冲激，困鬥的。這道路並不能想像爲一帆風順的直綫進行，而每每是灣灣曲曲的。這其間，思想上的風波就形成了思想與思想的矛盾現象。再就思想的發展說，思想總是有點保守性的，外部的映象每每不易被吸取，這其間亦要經過許多激戰。卽以忠於自己特殊生活環境的思想進程說，也不是某人一生下地就有了這思想的内容的。他也要經過由不自覺的漸漸走入自覺的階段。這一段路程也必然要發生思想的冲激。形成一種矛盾現象。</p>
<p>思想的發展過程一般說大槪，總是朝上進步的，但在今日社會，統治的思想每每征服了被統治的思想，吸取他階級的思想爲内容的事也並不少見。這可說，思想也可向下的發展，不過，這也有一定的界限，到自己階級自覺前爲止。可是，無論向上與向下，過程中都要現出矛盾。</p>
<p>所以思想與思想發生衝突，現出矛盾是極平常的現象。不過，有時它取的狀態是極端沉潛的，有時是彰明較著的。這是思想過程由徐緩的變化進入突變的順序，如果沒有徐緩的變當然不會有突變。有了徐緩的變，也不能不有突變。譬如一個决心自殺的人，他的自殺並不是一朝一夕决定的，他的悲觀的思想是在自殺前老早就有了的。自殺不過是突變。有些人看了一個人的變節認爲非常奇怪，其實這是淺薄之見。鄭孝胥甘爲漢奸，自有其爲漢奸的過程，不是一晚變成的功的。</p>
<p>至於思想上表現的小的矛盾，自然天天都有，一個語言學家，他的日常發言也許常閙笑話，一個論理學者，也許他常說出許多不合論理的話，這都是矛盾，是冲激過程中小的波浪，自不足怪。</p>

<p>總指揮曁各位敎官同學、現在世界沒有武裝不能維持國際間之和平、沒有强力不能維持國家獨立民族生存、中國過去是非常困難、現在又是國難重重、但中國之將來是很光明的、中國過去與現在所以這樣艱難、因幾十年沒有充實的武裝和力量、將來中國的光明、卽在中國今日之靑年、今日靑年卽將來的主人翁、但做主人翁必須有智識能力、將來才能管理國家、故國民黨與國民政府要敎育並訓練中國今日的靑年、文的方面敎育靑年充實近代智識、將來能繼續建設國家、武的方面訓練學生全體軍事化、使將來能持干戈以衛社稷、這種敎育和訓練就是充實國民的力量、使能負國家大任、在國難時期能持干戈以衛社稷、現在我們在這地凖備充實人力國力、但同學靑年不要忘記總理告訴我們的大無畏精神、和蔣委員長告訴我們的明禮義、知廉恥、負責任、守秩序、中國靑年過去太散漫了、受了軍訓、使軍事化、有嚴密的組織而後可以轉移風氣、希望同學澈底去實行、將來一定成爲好的有力量的國民、才有資格爲中國主人翁、才可建設中國復興民族云、</p>
<h3 id="c225">潘處長詞 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>今天看了各位的分列式、本人已感覺到很滿意、敵人處處在恥笑我們、現在我們能在每個星期僅、二小時的軍訓而有此成績、任何民族都幹不上、任何國家都不能在每星期二小時的軍訓之下、有此成績、這是很可以安慰的、上海是中國經濟文化</p>
<p>一切的中心、地位頗重要、各位同學要知道、上海的物質建設、是中國内地的血、流到上海、才建設這近代的上海、在上海我們處處受到敵人的干涉和壓迫、我們靑年同學切不要忘掉、有許多同學課餘專上跳舞塲、並以穿西裝說洋話爲時髦、這不是我們中國的靑年、故軍訓的意義完全是中國民族生存的命脈、是敎人做國民求生存之道過去學生運動有不少次流血、給果像五卅慘案之敎訓、表現我們沒有軍事力量印度革命已久而不能成功、亦是因爲沒有武裝力量、故在今日無論任何民族、其敎育雙方並進、軍訓有如此重要、各國都更行徴兵制度中國在未行徴兵之前、就要訓練靑年將來衛國云、</p>
<h3 id="c226">潘局長詞 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>今天看到各位同學的成績、非常興奮、軍訓目的是要有自衛衛國的力量、自衛衛國當然要有可以持干戈以衛社稷之精神、這種精神在軍訓中尤其希望各位注意團結、必須要有親受精誠的團結精神、如僅受到軍事上的技能訓練而忽略了團結精神、等於有了皮毛而忽略了精神、結東還是不能自衛衛國、中國過去許多軍隊不能救國家、就是這個原故、現在我們注意學生軍訓、卽寓兵於學、在學校中建築新軍隊之基礎、要有唯一親愛團結精神才可補救已往之缺點、達到我們期望之目的云、</p>
<h3 id="c227">吳局長詞 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>今天在此檢閱上海市高中以</p>
<p>上的學校軍訓、應有一個深刻的感想、卽我國自九一八·一二八以後、全國人民已知道國家民族之危險、所以大家在這國難嚴重的時期、都知道自衛能力之薄弱、致使敵人一再進攻、我們要雪恥復仇、保衛國家、復興</p>
<p>民族、先要充實力量、尤其要把這力量建築在靑年身上、靑年是站在最前面的戰士、國家已至非常做先鋒隊、同時世界危機之緊迫、一九三六年之大戰一觸卽發、中國在這二三年中要極力向前幹、以應付此大戰、這全在全國靑年在充實力量方面加倍努力、而後可以救國家民族云、</p>

<h3 id="c265">拾音器復活法 <a href="#c265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— 明襄</p>
<p>拾音器（Ｐｉｃｋ　ｕｐ俗稱電唱頭）是高貴收音機不可少的副件，使用稍久後，往往效力逐漸减弱，發音輕微，主要病因，由於其中有Ｕ形的永久磁鐵。此磁鐵兩極端間，雖有活動子（Ａｒｍａｔｕｒｅ）存在，磁力綫路，不致中斷，但活動子必須與磁鐵間留出相當空隙，方可活動，所以磁路總不能十分完密，磁性常有耗損，日久之後，漸至完全消失，不起作用，復活的方法，祗須重新加以强力的永久磁塲。</p>
<p>第一步手續，須先辨别拾音器磁鐵的極性，方法很簡易，可以磁針試之，磁針北極所指者，卽拾音器之南極，再另備一馬蹄形永久磁鐵，磁性須十分可靠，大小應擇與拾音器相稱者，以之安放在拾音器的平面上，放置時切須注意馬蹄磁鐵兩端的極性，必須與拾音器者相反，方能有效，否則不能復活，馬蹄鐵之地位，應使其兩極端靠近拾音器的下邊爲度，然後緊紥之，勿使移動（如圖）</p>
<p>將唱片置放轉盤上，開啓收音機的放大器，再以上述的拾音器擱上，或將使你驚奇，此突然宏亮的音調，有時竟較新的拾音器，更爲優美悅耳。</p>
<p>最後，更有一點須補救者，因此新加之馬蹄鐵，使拾音器重量加增，以致對於唱片的壓力加强，唱片旋轉，將起礙滯，甚至停止，補救方法，可在拾音器柄之另一端，加一適當重量的重物，使之平衡，如此可校配拾音器唱針的壓力，務使適度爲止。</p>
<h3 id="c266">公共天綫的配合法 <a href="#c266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— 一知</p>
<p>數隻收音機公用一根天綫以收音，昔以爲不可能的事實；因某機調整時，足影響其他收音機的收音，使訊號變動而騷擾，然若將這一根天綫，串接一組一組分離的綫圈及電容器，變動各收音機至天綫問總阻（ｌｍｐｅｄｅｄａｎｃｅ），換言之，卽使各收音機至天綫間的總阻不同，仿若數條天線，則無論一機，二機，或三機與四機，使用這一根公共的天綫，不會影響於收音的；猶之各機獨用一根天綫無異。</p>
<p>配合法如圖一，這公共的天綫，可供四具收音機之用Ｌ１爲二十圈，Ｌ２爲三十圈，Ｌ３爲四十圈，Ｌ４爲五十圈，繞綫用二十八號漆包綫，繞於直徑二寸膠木管上，Ｃ爲·０００１　法拉固定電容器。綫圈與電容器依圖一分組配合後，置於隔離罩中，引出至各收音機引入綫。（如圖二）以供應用。</p>

<p>— 李元慶</p>
<p>相傳聊齋上有一段故事，說是：「有一個姓馮的，因爲放掉一個額有白點的巨鼈，後來巨鼈答報大恩，便送他一個長僅寸許的小人。姓馮的自從佩了這個鼈寳之後，雖藏在黃泉底下的金銀寳貝，他也能一目了然。後來他在自己寢室中便掘得藏鏹數百，又在各處，掘出寬物無數，馮生竟因此富埓王公，」云云。這自是稗官家所虚搆出來的故事，誰也不敢相信他有這麽一回事實。可是本篇所介紹的寳物探尋器，却眞能担負鼈寳的任務，丨替你指示出寳物的所在地　　舊式未設隔離裝置的再生式收音機，在使用的時候，如果我們的手靠近收音機的任何部份，喇叭中便時常會引起一種狂呌，這是收音機對於人體發生感應的緣故。下面所說的寳物探尋器，牠的基本原理，便是根據這一點特殊現象而設計的。</p>
<p>第一圖爲探尋器之外觀。Ａ爲發射機，（Ｔｒｎｓｍｉｔｔｅｒ）其内部構造如第二圖，Ｌ爲繞在木箱外之環狀綫圈，共繞十圈，在第五圈處抽出一中分綫。Ｂ爲接收機。（Ｒｏｃｅｉｖｅｒ）其内部構造如第三圖，環狀綫圈Ｌ，亦繞十圈。</p>
<p>使用時，先調節接收機使與發射機諧振。次振動發射機之木箱，以接收機内不聞聲響爲度。此時綫圈Ｌ必與Ｌ，互成直角。平時四週電波均成有規律的散射，（如第四圖上半部所示）但一遇金銀等金屬物後，一部份電波便被吸收而失眞。射出的電波，旣失平衡，（Ｂａｌａｎｃｅ）聽筒中便得音訊。</p>
<p>爲求接收機靈敏度更進一步計，可調節Ｒ　或在檢波管内加裝再生圈（如第三圖　綫所示）使産生振盪。這樣，平時聽筒内所聽到的，祗是發射機與接收機的週率差（Ｂｅａｔ　Ｆｒｅｑｕｅｎｃｙ）丨一種嘘嘘的呌聲。當探尋器遇到金屬物後，發射機或接收機的本身週率便受影響，結果聽筒内發生的音調便有變化。</p>
<p>探尋器所需的材料及其數値，有如下述：</p>

<p>— 吳善長</p>
<p>替人家代裝一只收音機，試後音量不十分滿意。因此疑心到天綫太短，或初級綫圈太少，於是在天綫柱上加一綫圈（約四五十圈（，音量雖增而選擇性不佳，再移於地綫柱，也是同樣結果，最後天地綫接柱上各加一綫圈，使二圈平行，選擇性亦不佳，再將二圈垂直，方得滿意，音量增大，而對於選擇性亦無問題。</p>
<p>自製固定電容器的材料</p>
<p>自製固定電容器，並通總用香烟錫紙，以其容易得到而且隨處都有，考香烟錫紙近年來都以極薄的鋁展成，性質極脆，弄得不好，極易弄破，勢必重做，時間上極不合算；因此我找他種易得之材料代替，則捨，空牙膏瓶莫屬，厚而質軟，駕馭極易，再則固定電容器之絶緣，可用照相用的軟底片，洗去表面之膠質，成透明之假象牙（Ceiuloid）薄片成大小之方塊以代雲母片，成績亦佳，用以作旁路電容器及栅極電容器，都能應用，軟片不易得，則用蠟紙·不過絶緣較遜。</p>
<p>隔離罩</p>
<p>隔離罩本刋已有李元慶先生介紹過，這裏不過利用廢物而已，將一個金屬鑵洗乾凈，就能應用，擇其高度和直徑相當者，作爲眞空管或綫圈間的隔離罩，殊爲便利。</p>

<p>— 劉同康</p>
<p>因了一時的興趣，現在我且將今年春假期裏試騐結果，所得到成績比較能使人滿意的路寫在這裏，以資同好者的參考。</p>
<p>爲了時常見到本刋和其他的雜誌報章上載有用３３號輸出强力管製成單管收音機的綫路，據說成績的優越超過普通二管機，於是引起了我的好動心，試騐的結果成績總不算壞，但唯一的缺點就是振盪的不穩定，和用電的太不經濟。　　經過一個短時期的改良，這才漸漸的使我感到滿意起來。圖一卽爲此機的錢路。原機中的３３號眞空管在此地是改用了３８號汽車管，成績和３３號完全一樣。因爲牠更多一陰極的緣故，因此是交直流都可用，尤其是在用交流電源時，交流聲更可平靜得同用直流一般。絲壓是６·３弗打而絲流又並不大，與３３號相彷。此機採用電子交連式的再生力，故振盪非常穩定，而雜聲也最小，這是原錢路所萬不及的。總之，此機在選擇性上，音量上，音質上都臻上乘。</p>
<p>圖中綫圈個一時直徑紙質或膠質管上用３２號漆包綫繞十圈作Ｌ，距二分，用同號綫繞一百二十五圈作ＬＩ，繞畢後不必將綫頭剪斷，抽一頭，向反對方向繞三十圈作Ｌ２Ｃ爲調節波長之活動電容器。容量爲０００３５ＭＦＤ　ＣＩ爲０００ＩＭＦＤ之栅極電容器Ｃ２，爲ＩＭＦＤ之傍路電容器，是在轉動ＲＩ時避去雜聲用者，Ｃ３爲００２ＭＦＤ之固定電容器。Ｃ４爲００６ＭＦＤ之固定電容器Ｒ爲５ｍｅｇ之栅漏ＲＩ爲控制再生用之５００００歐姆電位器，ＫＩ爲２００００歐姆固定電阻圖中之ＲＦＣ高週率扼制錢圈與收音機頗有關係，故宜採用品質優良者。Ａ電可用四段圓電串連或以電鈴方栅改製，Ｂ電用一百三十五弗打或九十弗打最好是能用至一百八十弗打，則音量更可宏大，乾電池。　　此機可放小號揚聲器以供一室人之娛樂。</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>中國人對於笙有一個特殊的認識，大家都把笙看做是一種促成肺病的東西，甚至有人說把用得年代稍久的笙劈開來，裏面往往可以發現血水；這個我雖不曾目睹，但是在宮裏的確曾經有過一個太監，因爲吹笙得太吃力，便害了很厲害的咳嗽病。</p>
<p>以下是琵琶，古琴，喇叭，湯鑼，笛，簫，鐃鈸，等。譯者按：這些樂器普通的人大槪都知道，作者的原文是專給西人看的，所以講得很詳細；我們這裏，便無須直譯出來了，故一槪從略。）</p>
<p>皇太后的樂工都是有助手帶着的，上面已經說過了。可是這些助手的音樂智識，實在並不輸於他們的正手；因爲當奏樂的時候，他們的正手所用的樂器是時常要更換的，而且更換得非常的快，往往並不知照他們的助手，要用什麽樂器，全讓這些助手自己辦别，把該用的遞給他們，這當然不是外行所能担任的了。何况他們一面要傳遞某種應用的樂器，一面以得把不用的樂器掛到那個大架子上去，手續更不十二分的麻煩呢！</p>
<p>整個的講起來，皇太后的這一班樂隊所奏的樂聲，眞可說是很神秘的。當這些樂工在演奏的時候，每個人都扳着臉，絲毫沒有表表，像裝着機械的木頭人一樣；我想他們無論怎樣吹打，自己總是絶無感覺的。</p>
<p>但是在皇太后的眼光裏看起來，除了他們之外，世界上再也找不出這樣偉大的音樂家來了。（五三）</p>

<p>老友非非居士，新近爲了×案的牽連，給公安分局抓住。照例應該　　解往總局，轉解司法辦理；可是總局把它接收以後，並不迅移司法，就望拘留所裏一推。</p>
<p>這間拘留所，實在小得無可再小，而的確好稱「斗室」！一張木板釘成的坑，佔去全室三分之二，以致坑前餘地，不够屁股的迴旋。觀曠壁上，却是滿目琳琅，書畫咸備，可謂極盡表現藝術的能事。</p>
<p>書的方面，各有其發揮個性的一種口</p>
<p>氣。「到此地，肚子裏，不要氣」！是絶對地抱着達觀主義。「不到此間非好漢，再來不値半文錢」！可以算是英雄主義。至若「×××老婆偷漢子」！「×××妻子偷漢郎頭」！那是已落「下乘」的誹謗主義，而成爲「劉四駡人」了！</p>
<p>畫的方面，尤極滑稽。一武裝同志，面對裸體婦人，作舉槍射擊之狀，裸婦身旁，註着「野雞！卽×××的老婆」！尙有長頸修尾的飛鳥一頭下書「×××太太的小影」！才知所繪也是一隻野雞：這好像都是譏諷伊是「山梁」出身。此外更有書畫合璧的佳構，畫的是棺材一具，主牌一個。棺材的前和，題曰：「亡故×××靈柩」！主牌亦題「×××之神位」！其下還添畫烏龜一隻，殼上寫着「×××」三字；於斯足覘它的積怨不淺！</p>
<p>壁角落裏，盡屬香烟殼子，有字紙，橘皮菓殼······堆得像小丘，濕淋淋的水跡，打從堆中流出，臊臭之氣，不可嚮邇！這大槪是一般難友所做排洩工作的成績吧？不審負有提倡「淸潔」「衛生」的公安當局，對此，將何說之辭？</p>

<p>— 胡樹</p>
<p>幾天不曾吃飯，肚子並不覺得飢餓，這也許是病人僅有的能耐，雖則肌肉快得像溶氷似的消瘦下去，可是飯錢總算省下來了。做一天吃一天的人，倘然生了病仍還要吃飯，那是早要了阿達的命了。不請醫，不服藥，睡在床上，轉側呻吟已是够受罪了，肚子再不爭氣，窮人都得死光了。</p>
<p>阿達雖是一個工人，因爲是獨個兒身子沒有妻子兒女的贅累，所以他平日的境况倒也並不過得怎樣壞；每餐三大碗飯，早晨一大團粢飯，金鼠牌香烟每天也可抽幾枝，白酒和花生米，也時常吃喝得醉醺醺的。空閑的時候呢，泡一壺濃濃的茶同幾個志同道合的朋友指天劃地的講講笑話談談新聞，不知道什麽是愁，也不知道什麽是恨，逍遙自在的白天裏工作，黑夜裏睡覺，誰都不會去麻煩他，他也不會去麻煩誰。除了倘然酒性發作時哼幾句不成腔的歌調之外，總是笑臉迎人一團和氣。</p>
<p>國难中之國民</p>
<p>可是自從突然患了這塲病，精神上受了重大的打擊，他開始悲憫着身世的凄凉和遭遇的慘酷了。雖則勉强從死神手裏掙脫出來，從前生龍活虎般的身體，現在是變得像弱不禁風的娘兒們一樣了，臉上的笑容，早已消失，額上的皺紋更顯得密而且深。</p>
<p>「他媽的，年紀並不大呀，恁地，就嬌嫩得這個樣兒。」這是在他病後工作歸來蹌踉地倒在床上時的嘆聞。</p>
<p>當然，五十歲光景的阿達，本來算不得怎樣的衰老，拚着他一身膂力何愁沒地方吃飯！他以爲爲生成的苦命，混得一口苦飯就够了，只要肯吃苦，不愁沒飯吃。可是他何嘗想到現在竟會因爲吃不下飯而遭累他吃不來苦了呢！</p>
<p>但是可憐的他還說：「幸而現在飯量减少了，不然不苦死，也得餓死啦！」</p>

<p>— 淸癯</p>
<p>書有「若作和羹，爾惟鹽梅」是梅在古代已知道可吃的東西；不過載籍上，沒有說明怎樣吃法？就是其它「羣芳譜，」「農政全書，」以及「本草綱目，」和「古今圖書集成，」那幾種書裏頭，也都有記載，并且可以治疾病，充作藥用上之要品，惜不甚詳明，倘有人加以釐訂，再參以現在科學的調製作用，可敢說梅的利益必定狠大：所以余最喜吃梅，茲將梅之製藏的簡便方法，略寫數則如下。</p>
<p>糖製取早實靑色的梅子，用針向他周四刺過，然後浸在食鹽的稀溶液水中，（大約四兩鹽和九斤多的不，）經四小時取出，再傾入淸水内漂過，至去盡鹹味爲度，如拿梅子十斤，則用熟蜆殼灰六兩復浸在淸水裏，多至十二小時，繼去其灰屑，乃約一斤多的水，一斤多的糖，使成甜液，將梅子傾入，每過兩日，加糖一次，（約照第一次四分之一，）至甜性和梅，恰如其度，不足兩星期，梅子的肉質，其性已變，食之，只覺其甜，而不知其酸令人適口了；儻常浸在此糖液的器裏，雖至四五年，也不至於變性而腐敗，如嫌梅子的色采，不能悅目，還可以用硫酸銅，或藍石等，（最便用制錢最小的鷄眼錢，）入於糖液中，（約每梅十斤，用二分或三分，）唯不可過度，否則，含過量的毒性，不但發出一種極惡的臭質，而且吃之有害；苟能適如其量，這種製法，非常適口，而肉質堅脆，嚼之有聲，無異新鮮的梅子，以前有人題此種糖製，呌它爲「風雨梅，」就是這個意思！</p>
<p>鹽製取靑硬堅實的梅子，大約每一斤，須用鹽二兩左右，同入陶器中，并加以熱水，使不至乾燥，最好再將重物壓在上面，乃不至於發霉等害，且鹹性亦易透足：如藏在器中，密蓋勿入空氣，已可耐久，若再在陽光中晒之，使底面皆受過熱烈的烘託，至兩三星期的經過，梅子的表面發出一種鹽霜其色純白，極爲美觀：不過在晒的當兒，必須防止雨水浸入，倘一不愼，最易霉爛，這種製法，前人稱它呌「梅胚，」可藏至十餘年不壞；因常帶著極細的鹽粒，看起來，頗象屋瓦上的霜一樣，所以也呌他爲「霜梅；」如做桂花和玫瑰花作醬，拿此梅子的汁來加入其中，桂花的色玫瑰花的色，更覺黃而且紅了！因它的酸性，最能煥發其色素的緣故！</p>
<p>藥製將梅胚傾入淸水中浸之，（約十小時，）至鹽質去淨，再將水濾完，然後和於百分</p>
<p>之五十的糖液裏，必須排盡梅子固有的酸味爲止，以前的糖液，雖復經棄去，亦不足惜；再加以極濃厚的糖液，使梅肉滲入甜性，至足味後，和以檸檬　片，搗之成醬一般，乃再用丁香，薄荷，八角，或極芬烈的香料，加其氣質；最後取藏之年久的陳皮末入其中，再曝諸日光，時已成醬質，而梅之體積，也已浮漲，等到稍乾，就可以用蠟紙包裹，雖經久可吃，且非但在旅途中當作淸暑的用品，而亦是一種藥用，物因拿幾種藥味來配製成功的，故市上出售的「陳皮梅」三字，最最著名，就是用這種方法！</p>
<p>其他製法如「梅粘，」味可以甜，或可以鹹，隨人的口味爲限，而色也可以靑，可以黃，可以紅，也可以黑；其質非特可以成「糊，」可以成「膠，」可以成「汁，」且可以成「露，」都視其製法而變化；南方以梅醬爲主，北方有酸梅湯的出名而梅的「咭汁，」梅的「遮釐，」和梅的「滑粘，」則不是普通的製法了；現在最爲市上所知道的，要算上海小南門張祥豐的「淸鹽梅子，」外此靑浦珠街閣的「梅皮，」也極有名聲；不過梅皮似乎糖質太重，反失卻梅的本性，這大約吃梅子的人們，多半是怕酸的，而歡喜是甜的一個憑據麽？</p>

<p>第三十回目送哀鴻埋頭守國土彈穿勁臂　血染孤城</p>
<p>屋外邊只聽到脚步奔騰聲，有的是跑過去，有當又是跑過來。這正是增加飛機上的人，無限的趣味，在上面看到下面的人，猶如熱石上的螞蟻，紛紛亂跑。他看定人跑得很稠密的所在，又轟的一聲，賞下一枚炸彈，這一個炸彈落地，不但是有那震破人耳鼓的響聲，而且飛沙變成了烟霧，騰起來有幾丈高，在那烟霧中便飛騰着老百姓的一隻手，一條腿，一段體腔。總而言之，是這裏老百姓，作夢所想不到的事，便是親眼得見了。於是接連着這幕慘劇，嘩嘩的哀哭聲，又跟的發生出來。所幸這頭上的飛機，只有一架，而且所帶的炸彈，數盡於此。因之在這個炸彈抛下來以後，飛機在天空上繞了兩個大圈子也就飛着走了。在堡寨裏的這些軍民，大家雖是二十四分的鎭靜着，並不以爲這是什麽生死關頭，但是這飛機究是初次光臨，又加着老百姓那樣吃哮奔走，也不由得各人心裏不隨着蹦跳起來。直等飛機去了，各人的心房，方才定止，然而老百姓們，還是哭着喊着，吵閙不休。殷得仁這時站在空地裏，皺了雙眉，向紛亂的老百姓看着。回頭見趙自强了站在身邊，便淡笑道：你瞧這些老百姓，眞是可憐又可笑。戰塲上飛了兩隻飛機來，猶之乎我們在家中院子裏頭看到幾隻麻雀，這算得了什麽？有了他們這一塲胡攪亂，不免搖動軍心。我去對營長說，非把他們轟走不可！說時，他揑了拳頭，在手心裏打了幾下。自强道：可不是？我們對弟兄們說過幾個鐘頭的話，好容易把人心鎭定了，他們這樣一嚷，以前的力氣，那全是白費。（四○四）</p>

<p>有許多東西在西洋是必然的，在敝國却要大費唇舌。例如：口喝了要飲水，在西洋人是無疑的，但在敝國却大以爲不然：有許多人根本不主張飲水，也不贊成喝茶，只主張吃一個酸梅或橄欖。在日常吸一支紙烟是不算事的；但在内地却不許吸紙烟了，有士兵在路上搶了去。</p>
<p>但現在我們不妨又唱高調了，我們需要博物館！</p>
<p>道理呢？丨丨沒有道理，無條件要建築大博物館。</p>
<p>預料有許多人又將反對了：「東北已經建立了「滿洲國」，人民生計這麽迫促，你們這班喪心病狂的人還要糜費國家的金錢，起無用的博物館麽？所以我們的張競生博士說的好：中國的古玩賣給外國非常應該，因爲可以用這錢換槍砲，換來槍砲打外國，打敗外國又收回來。如同垂棘之璧無羔，馬齒加長而已。而且，人民這般沒有飯吃，還要學雕刻，畫油畫，可見就是亡國奴，亡了國你們還畫油畫麽？還要起博物館麽？」</p>
<p>另有一說：「根本這是資産階級吃西餐吸雪茄後的消遣品，這些布爾喬亞氣味的廢物，油畫呀！雕刻呀！我們就非常地必然地看不起，所以這皆要沒落而且必然的沒落了。我們是站在世界文化鬥爭塲合的最前線，敢於說，藝術我們不要，更無論藝術所附麗的什麽渺小的輕微的博物館了。」</p>
<p>另有一說：「如果國家眞有一筆剩餘的錢，倒不妨建築幾家大京戲院，或起幾座電影院。這旣可以開通民氣，又可以增加收入。將一些破破爛爛的古玩，冷淸淸地擱在一所廟似的房子裏，有誰要看呀？所以，區區主張起戲院。」</p>

<p>— 老白</p>
<p>綺君是我五年前底一個最親密的朋友，今年在這個冷漢的城市中相見了，二人都感到一種無限的快慰。我們雖然要好，好得比任何的友人都要親切；但我們各有各的思想，而且這思想還是相差到很遙遠的。在深夜，抑或在我們的交談中，我時常會感到這是我們友情間的一件憾事。記得在五年前底時候，綺君便時常對我說：「一個人底思想無論如何是不能被俘虜的。你我便是這樣，因爲我信仰我底思想；我以爲我底思想是有意義的。無論我底思想是如何的被人們認爲無價値或者是無聊的，但我必竟是要堅持下去的呵。」</p>
<p>在我們兩人中間永遠地隔膜着一種東西，這便是思想。</p>
<p>綺君是一個最會浪費自己的人，他底人生觀便是享樂。他曾經說過：「人活在世界上就是求快樂；我活在世界上一日就要享受一日的快樂與幸福，我不會憂慮什麽············」然而我聽了他道話又想樣呢？我能把他的不正確的思想糾正轉來嗎？但有時我也曾用些刺激的言語來規勸他，結果他一點也不曾動心。他以爲他底浪費自己的生活是欣樂的，有意義的表現。他曾說過：他需要浪費，他需要快樂來調劑他底生活。他還說他要永遠的抱着享樂主義；甚至到他死了，他還依然要享樂的。</p>
<p>我們是在那波里離别的。綺君那時心中充滿了快慰的情緒站在輪船上底甲板上向我說：「白，現在你該回去了！我到了開羅之後一定給你信。·········」綺君底話在深深地刺　着我，我不禁流淚了！但是我那時流淚並不是爲了留戀綺君底關係；因爲我在爲綺君悼惜，我悼惜着綺君底靑春，我更悼惜着許多像綺君一般的浪費靑春底人。</p>
<p>綺君這次到開羅去，並沒有甚麽事情。他是去玩；去把他底寳貴的靑春浪費在享樂里。　　自綺君離開我以後，我底腦中時常有着他底影子。在每···個深夜，我便會想到他，我還會想到許多的浪費者。</p>
<p>今年我們又相逢在這地方了。</p>
<p>綺君差不多每天都要到我這裏來，可是他底那種享樂的觀念依然沒有絲毫的改變。</p>
<p>在這一個孤寂的城市里，更且是我一個人孤零地住着這一幢小的房子，房東太太是一個不大願說話的人，所以我便需要朋友的來臨了；因爲朋友來了多少總可以解一點我底愁悶的。</p>
<p>到我道兒來底有學生，也有在工廠中做着事的。他們到我這裏來，大槪都是在夜晚，甚至在更深的靜夜。所以在白天里我還是免不了寂寞，雖然我還在學校裏讀書。現在好了，綺君終於又在這地方重見了。至於以前在白天里所感到的寂寞也就不知道到甚麽地方去了。</p>
<p>因爲這是在春天，外面的空氣非常新鮮。我被綺君拉到杜威爾河畔來閒遊。河水上起伏着銀色的小波，反映着深綠底椰子樹，幾乎變成了一幅美麗的圖晝。我們就坐在這株椰子樹下說着一些别後的情景。</p>
<p>「綺，你現在總該改變了你底思想罷？」我拍着綺君底肩這樣說話，然而他却沒有回答我甚麽話語。他笑着搖了一下頭，這是表示他底思想並不曾改變。</p>
<p>「那麽·········你底思想是永遠也不會改變的了？」</p>
<p>「唔·········」綺君像記起了一件事似的偶然地說。「你不是說過一個人底思想永遠也是不會改變的麽？」</p>
<p>「是的·········」我坦然地說·「這話雖然不錯，但是我覺得你底思想，你底那隨落的思想是應該改變的；你要知道：一個有正義的，有眞理的思想才値得珍貴呵！·········綺，你的思想是不是有正義有眞理的呢？」</p>
<p>綺君沒有做聲，他依舊在微笑着。我底心裏被一種奇異的感覺佔有着。我想到綺君底靑春，我還想到許多像綺君一樣的浪費者的靑春。我惘然着，一種無比的悲哀佔有着我。</p>
<p>忽然綺君站了起來，他打了一個呵欠便開始在草地上來回的走動着。綺君底光亮的皮鞋在草地上摩擦得發出一種驕傲的怪聲。我不敢看綺君底臉，因爲我看見了他的臉色我便會想起一個人的生命，想起一個人的靑春，綺君在近年來雖然他沒有憂慮，沒有悲哀，但在他的額上却同樣地畫上了幾條深刻的皺紋。我覺得一個人在享樂中，在浪費中，讓自己慢慢地年老是一件很可惜的事；一估人爲甚麽不去做他應做的事業哩？一個年靑的人爲甚麽要把自己的靑春在享樂中浪費掉呢？·········苦悶的火燄在燃燒着我底心。我呆望着綺君兩條長的法蘭絨褲脚下底一雙比鏡子還要光亮的皮鞋在草地上往復的走動。·········我像在做着一個夢，一個痛苦的夢。</p>

<p>— 英子</p>
<p>種着不開花的花的人是寂寞的。</p>
<p>可是，在期望花開的時候，是比對着滿樹繁英的時候爲更有意思呢。與其看着花開花落，倒不如一頭就沒有花開的好。我愛着嫋娜的寥寂的空庭，和不開花的花木。</p>
<p>偶然的種點花，也不過是學着種種罷了。附庸風雅的意思固沒有，就中連想看一朶花的意思也是沒有的。而且對這也眞感覺着無限的空虚呢丨丨在圜藝學的素養和經騐上。</p>
<p>在我底境遇上，對於悠閒到像種花這一類的事，似乎是絶緣體了。說也雖得的，意外地有了幾個月的閒暇，然而一個　在生活的急流上喘息慣的人，對着這麽悠長的時日，是會覺着多麽的無聊呵！</p>
<p>於是我想到種點花。</p>
<p>種點花，無非是想藉以排遣那種無聊感，和把這幾個月底漠漠的年華度到那些不開花的花木上去而已。别的意思是沒有的。　　兩株素色的月秀和一株白玫瑰，還是兩年前智果禪師做人情送我的，據媽說，已經兩年沒曾開過花，兩年沒曾施過肥了。不想我回到故鄕的時候，牠們還活着，可憔悴多啦。（做主人的底責任啊！）便替牠們稍微去了些蕪雜的枝葉，加了點新泥，把來擱在庭院裏的魚缸上，倒成了這嫋娜的　寂的空庭底上點小點景咧。</p>
<p>此外，是一株剛綻蕊的白山茶，一株快萎謝的迎春，一株落盡了葉落盡了花的臘梅。花了一元多錢從市上買來的。我也把牠們裝成盆景，和兩年沒曾開過花的月季玫瑰一同安置在庭院裏。</p>
<p>可是，都是沒有花的花啊：</p>
<p>每天晨起，便拎着噴水壺去澆一遍水。再移把躺椅到花旁，浴在春天的陽光裏，讀着一册爲自家所愛好的明人小品或詩集。有些時候，就常常會給一種寂寂的魚缸裏那幾尾游魚噴水的聲響，或是葉底透出來的「嗡嗡」的蜜蜂的呌聲把精神帶去了。便默默地站起來在花旁徘徊一會，對着那落在水面上的流蘇的花影，那躱在花影</p>
<p>下戲水的幾尾游魚出神。·········</p>
<p>想不到這幾天氣候又轉冷了。</p>
<p>那株剛綻蕊的白山茶，就爲陰寒所勒，一直開不出花來。兩年不曾開過花的月季和玫瑰，也沒開花的意思。臘梅雖抽了靑，但牠要我們把希望寄托到冬天呢。</p>
<p>沒有花啊，沒有花啊！　　昨夜聽了一夜的雨，起來跑進庭院一看，那株快萎謝的迎春花也落盡了。只有一隻蜘蛛在花下結了個網，張得幾瓣落英，彷彿想挽住這已逝的春光似地。</p>
<p>春天完了。我頗動了遊心。</p>

<p>大途間，除談着我十年間的奮、鬥史外，便間雜地談着南洋最近的商情了丨丨在南洋，人是非談着商情不可的，此外也便沒有什麽好談了。因此，漸漸地談到本埠的商况，談他自己的店，又談到我的姑丈的。一談到道，我的朋友便放低着聲音，莊重地說：</p>
<p>「唩，逸生，我看你的姑丈的生意很危險呢！從前固然賺到不少，他老人家很會經營，不過賺到的多寄回家去了，聽說家鄕造了大厦，又買了些田地，那倒很好。現在，不幸的是，「不景氣」來了。在此刻，沒有現金是辦不到貨物的。上下盤的生意都困難，誰都不敢嘱賬。所以他老人家因爲櫃子裏不飽，眞費苦心呢！去年險些兒倒閉下去，虧得他老有手段，又給扶起來。不過生意已經傷了根　，在這種險像下是更難於支持的。雖然他店裏年年都宣布賺了錢，但從實際上調查和考究起來，前年最少要輸去十千，去年呢，更利害了，恐怕二十千不止罷？并且去年的風潮，雖然遮掩過去了，而中心的空虚，那是大家都知道的。做生意的人，誰不打起眼睛做事？外强中乾，在買賣上終要露出破綻來吧？所以我總是替他担心哩！」</p>
<p>這些話使我引起一個很大驚異，那是和姑丈日裏的話完全相反的。并且以十年前君興號招牌的興旺，那眞令人不信有這回事。難道像姑丈般的手段的商人，竟在這「不景氣」的鐵掌下束手無策嗎？不過，張君的話倒是可以信得的。他們雖是營業上的敵對者，而在友誼上，他對我的話素來是誠實可靠的。關於姑丈的大厦，前年暑假我回家的時候，是參觀過的了，聽說營造了五六萬銀子。所以，無論如何，這件事是眞的了。就是以現在姑丈體格的淸瘦，今天據我看見的顔色的嚴重，這却是一件最好的鐵證了。并且今天當我從貨棧間走過的時候，那裏面的貨件是疏落地放得很少。十年前，那是堆得滿滿的，還要租着一間土人的屋子幫着放呢。那嗎，從這些事件推測起來，事態的嚴重是眞够令人憂心的。於中，我驚呌着：　　「呵！那怎麽好？」</p>
<p>「不過，朋友，」我的朋友慢拖着他的聲音，輕輕地道：「他老人家或許會想到别人所想不到的計劃呢？去年的風潮，他能够救轉來，現在難道不能够重新想出妙計來嗎？一個有前，他把店屋和貨物保了十萬盾（十）的火險。在現在現金十分支細的時光，竟不計算眼前的急用，却付出一筆不小的保險金，去希望後日的安全。這事件眞够令人疑心呵！人家都說，這狐狸的妙計來了！」</p>
<p>我沈默地聽着，靜想此中的道理。這時候，天已暗了，椰樹已顯出牠的黑色的巨大的身軀，在這原始世界的夜裏雄偉地屹立着。一會兒，天上蓋上了黑雲，像要下雨的樣子。忽然又吹起風來，我說：</p>
<p>「回去罷！怕雨來哩！」</p>
<p>「風刮，雨是沒有了。不過，天太暗了。回店裏坐談去罷。恐怕他們已經來了，等着我們呢。」</p>

<h3 id="c302">何苦進大學 <a href="#c302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>
<p>— 明堂</p>
<p>最近蕭伯納有一篇文章，呌「何苦進大學」（見國際譯報譯文）。這題目是很奇怪的。牠的内容是說，現代的大學，是不能敎人以實際知職的。牠只能敎人以虚僞的知識。牠們只能「先把你的頭腦撤空，然後把虚僞的思想塡塞進去」（蕭語）。因此他反對大學，反對現代的大學。他要「世界上所有的大學的應該一律剷平，永遠絶跡」（同前）。他呌學生們要把學校裏的敎科書一齊扔開。因爲這些敎科書都是沒有用的，只能害人。然後你再從許多實際知識中去「披沙揀金」似的找尋你所要學應該學的東西。這些東西才是你所要學的眞實知識（皆本蕭語）</p>
<p>蕭爲什麽要這樣竭力反對現代的大學呢？他有理由的。他的理由是：「不久以前，世界文明幾乎被一次可怕的戰爭所毁滅。這次戰爭是擁有大學學位的人們所搆成的。世界上有兩種眞正危險的人物，一種是半受敎育的人，他們毁損了文明之泰半；一種是全智全能的知識階級，他們幾乎把整個世界毁損了。因之，他說「我相信要保存一種文明，我們需要多少帶些原始精神的人。但是大學所造就的人物，大都帶有虚僞的智能」。所以他不得不竭力反對大學，現代的大學。而且，他「預言」到「現代文明的崩潰，就在眼前，而所謂黑暗時代又將重臨斯土了」。這是一個多麽沉痛的批判啊。</p>
<p>然而，批判還不過是批判而已。蕭究竟不過是一個富於諷刺能力的一個文學家。這里，他並不能暴露出現代大學的根本弱點是在那里。固然，在他的筆下，他的文章是應該這樣寫的。然而，爲了要更澈底的說明這一文章的意義起見，我們却不能不予以相當之補充。再則，他說現在我需要多少帶些「原始精神」的人，這也是錯誤的。事情的所以壞，原不在人之原始與不原始，而是在於制度的變換。蕭有沒有明顯的指出呢？沒有。很顯然的，蕭終究不過是一個有諷刺力的文學家，終究不過是一個費邊派的自由主義者，人道主義者。對於現實，他是並沒有認識淸楚的。</p>
<p>現代大學的所以壞，其根本原因究竟是在那里呢？蕭只指出了現代大學如何的壞，而我們必須進一步指出他爲什麽壞，更進而去掃除這個壞處，這樣才對。</p>
<p>問題不在知識的眞實不眞實，虚僞不虚僞，人情的原始不原始，而是在於舊的時代已經腐蝕破滅。我們不要求原始精神，我們要更新一個時代的精神；我們不要「剷除」大學，我們要求另一新時代的大學；我們不否認敎育，我們要求更超過現時代的新敎育。</p>
<h3 id="c303">投入都市之後 <a href="#c303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>— 設</p>
<p>她擠出破落的農村，被父親帶來這「掘金窠」之上海，投入活地獄般的工廠裏，隨着大羣的工錢奴隷，每日在機械的齒輪下拚着血汗，掙取三毛兩毛一天的工資，維持她那一家四口的生活。</p>
<p>她父親四業不居，從小在外跑江湖　　，直至現在還是如此。整天和一派白相朋友厮混，不作一點正事，又愛無所不爲，有時闖出大禍，累得闔家不寗，對於自己妻兒的死活，他很少擔過心事，有次，她給齒輪碾去兩個指頭，他也全不過問，只怪她不小心，無故掙斷一有子的生命綫，這便是個絶好的例證　　自從十歲做活，她現在已有十四歲了。</p>
<p>她是個道地的鄕姑娘，但是長期生活於都會的環境裏，不期然也沾染了一些好時髦的派頭。一襲常時保持着整潔的布旗袍，適配着她那苗條活潑的身材，加上一幅豐潤的圓臉，嫻靜的嬌態，看去格外顯露着天眞的處女美，令人不免有些飄飄然。</p>
<p>但她頗有些異樣。年紀雖然漸長了，却還不感覺需要性的滿足。廠裏一些男女工常地一堆搭訕着，也引不起她多少興奮，她並未十分了解這兩性間的神秘之謎。有時一些靑年男工，趕着出進相見的機會，向她投一些猥言浪語，她有臉立卽脹紅，掉頭不顧走去了。</p>
<p>童阿六是銅匠間裏的。他與她同在龍十五娘家吃包飯，每天至少得見兩次面。童阿六是豫豐紗廠最著的「釘梢」，誰不怕他的利害！他一見她年輕，貎亦不惡的是可人兒，而她父母又窵居閘北，遠水難救近火，憑着他那油腔滑嘴，使盡方法去勾搭她，她賞給他個不理。童阿六懊喪之餘，心血來潮，軟的不行用硬的，勢非掉個槍花不可。於是利用星期日的休假，騙進附近一家旅館，開定一個房間，嚇禁她聲張，她一時又膽小，又受不住各樣的引誘，在暴力利誘的重壓下，處女的貞操，第一次被他那個了。</p>
<p>自後，旅館裏常時有着他們的足踪，她的工作不免也荒廢了一些。「關餉」時，遂由童阿六掏腰包，貼補幾文，掩飾漏露風聲，她的父母自然還蒙在皷中。不久，他在廠裏因三日兩不做被歇了業，窮得莫辦法，她每月僅得的些須工資，也被他强索去花光了。</p>
<p>一天，她母親走去取工錢，撲個全空，又察知他的身體很有些異樣，一時疑問大起，待往各處一查，這才水落石出。於是與她父親連同把童阿六扭進捕房。經捕頭一問，童阿六堅不承認，而好也矢口不言，同時又尋不出一點相當的證據，捕房不肯受理，反遭受一番申斥，諭令出外，不准再閙。</p>
<p>她父親這一氣眞非同小可。回去把她吊猪似的反吊起來，彷彿法庭審案的逼取了一些供詞，因得在旅館裏的循環簿上，搜獲幾次確證，正待要再去扭進捕房，而童阿六早已全無去向了。</p>
<p>她父親莫辦法，至此只得讓她退出××紗廠，改入閘北一爿織布廠，就便敎管，於是她又在軋軋的機杼聲下，開始了另一種工錢奴隸的生活了。</p>

<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>那殘酷底環境啊！它竟摧殘吾友以去了！</p>
<p>這是値得吾悲痛底一件事情；昨天吾突然地從另一面朋友丨祚的電話裏接到了一個很不幸的，很痛心底報告。他說：「蕓！你可知道嗎？如本已經去世了！這消息，是吾今天上午在他的一個親戚處得來的：那是該多末地使人悲慘啊！</p>
<p>「如本去世了」！當這句話刺進吾底耳鼓時，使吾怎樣底痛心啊！他非但是吾底好友，而且是生平底唯一知已；他現在正是一個奮發有爲的，具有新思想的革命靑年。哎！爲什麽好人多不壽的呢？彼蒼蒼者之無情，實在太可惡了。　　那時吾底手是顫了，抖得彷彿似篩糠一般，一手握住了電話聰筒，連半句話也沒得拚出口來；身上是一股冷氣直從背脊上透進，透入了肺腑。二顆淚珠撲籔籔地淌了出來，從腮邊掛到了胸前。吾恨不得立刻奔去和他一面，但是他遠在紹興，吾當然不能够身插兩翅而飛過了錢塘江，吾只有在這裏流淚，悲傷！</p>
<p>如本，朋友！請你恕吾吧！吾和你數載相處，眞無異是手足，却不料到如今，連要和你最後一面都不可能；恕吾吧！吾記得當年也曾和你說過；「吾們從此幸福同享，患難共嘗，用吾們兩顆純粹底心靈，用吾們兩個聖潔底靈魂，去和環境奮鬥，去和社會掙扎，去開闢吾們光大底前程，去創造吾們新底生命！」現在呢，這一切底一切，都成了夢話了。你已脫離了這惡濁世界，而到了另一個無聲無影底淸靜世界裏去，「一棺附身，萬事皆休」！可是吾當然，吾那一縷渺小底靈魂，也已追隨你之後；然而，吾那半僵底軀壳，依然沒有蛻化，依然存在着。</p>
<p>不錯，你以前也對吾表示，不滿意現實生活，而憧憬於人生底幻滅丨死。可不是嗎？吾也這樣安慰過你：「人生天地間，誰也不會有完全愉快的。幻滅，人生早晚終有這末一天底來臨，不過時間底遲早問題而已。一不意你現在已先吾而去實踐了吾底話，並且你已實地底嘗試了人生底幻滅！你畢竟是勇幹者，不平凡者；吾對了你，只有欽敬，只有慚愧！</p>
<p>但是吾却不能够這樣，决不能够像你這樣；因爲吾還沒忘記時代所給吾底使命！雖然，生活底重壓是一刻兒不肯放鬆吾，然而，吾却不能够因此而放棄了人生應負底責任。</p>
<p>你還記得嗎？在前年底秋天，秋天是一個感人的季節；這時吾還同你在一起，吾偶然的，不，習慣的，談起了身世，就意識到目前底痛苦。况且，那時候，吾又受了一個重大底刺激，所以憤怒得眼睛裏幾乎冒出火來。但，終於因此而吐了幾大口鮮血。不過，吾從些便堅决地覺悟起來了；從此，吾不消極，也不怨恨，祗努力地去建築吾底生活基礎，三年以來，雖是依然故吾。可是吾底意志却是磨練得比以前堅毅得多了。　　在一估悽風苦雨纏綿着底黃昏，吾底身子是躺在醫院裏的一只病床上，承你底情，不辭長途跋涉的從杭州赶來探視吾，吾當然是十分感激你的，但吾那時心中確實痛苦極了；也只得機械地用兩隻沒有神的眼睛盯了你一眼，沒有向你說什麽。原因是吾實在說不出什麽，吾也不願向你說什麽而使你傷心！</p>
<p>如本，朋友！吾和你認識了幾年，始終也沒有發生過什麽意見；雖有時也不免有些小小的誤會，不過大家都很諒解的，所以，始終也沒有閙過更深的意氣。</p>
<p>這種，吾該怪你，你底性情太固執，太拗拘了。你在去年底秋天得了病，吾就勸你就醫的無奈你看金錢看得太重，「有錢錢做起，無錢身做起」，話是不錯，你沒有多量的錢，但也得想法啊！你這任毛病一天一天底加深，吾想終究是太不値得吧！</p>
<p>自你上床之後，吾也曾同祚來探過你好多次，你也有時好有時壞，却使吾着實担憂，後來，吾的弟弟丨雄非丨於一月六日，被誣入獄了，於是吾又受了一個重大刺激；吾遂臥病半月。隔了幾天，吾來看你時，不料你已給那輛滬杭車帶走了，是以吾祗得悵惘地歸來。你到了鄕下，吾雖也寄過好多信給你，但連一次回音都沒有。</p>
<p>現在，吾忽然得到了這樣底一個不幸消息·唉！如本，朋友！你已忽心丢了你數年難分難離底朋友而去了嗎？啊！</p>

<p>— 奔</p>
<p>因爲隔晚失眠，一早起就打不起精神，頭腦暈沉沉地。但爲了職務的關係，不，索性嚮亮點說，爲着要「飯」吃。只得拦擻精神工作。好容易挨過了三小時，到了吃中飯的時候了。吃了飯，跑回宿舍，實在是很勉强的兩腿和兩手招上樓的，不用揩面，連「戒而未絶」的烟癮都不想過了，便一個朝天倒上床去，唿唿的不到一分鐘便睡着了。然而睡的却不安神，因爲上床時已是十二點過二十分，而一點鐘又得有事。</p>
<p>當一點鐘嚮了，同房的×君下樓之前，彷彿對我有過一聲呼喚，我也彷彿在夢寐中應了一聲「就起床」身子遽然一側，鐘聲嘡嘡地嚮，我猛的醒了。</p>
<p>這時我記起了，我的大財産丨皮袍。因爲是大財産，所以我對它是異樣的珍視，脫卸以後，就好好的把它包起，夏天臨了，更生怕虫傷霉壞，便每逢太陽當空，就把它搬出來搭曬。</p>
<p>這天正是午睡前一小時許把它搭曬在窗前的竹桿上，我知道風刮得頗是不不，還牢牢的用繩把竹桿紥系在，室内的桌脚上。這樣，應該是很可放心了。　　而且，雖則午後是那麽瞌睡了，但是，當進房時，我順勢看了一眼，它是在着。×君下樓之前喚我一聲，也彷彿有這麽一句，皮袍可以收了，風刮得太大。</p>
<p>就在這不到十分鐘的短時间裏，我的皮袍跌下樓去了，而且一跌就成了竊案。</p>
<p>我萬分的驚奇着，驚奇那偷竊的胆大，恐怕大到如「燈籠」。</p>
<p>當我翻身下床，一把擦過雙眼，走上窗前，啊！皮袍不見了！忙把頭顱俯視窗外，也不見它落在地上。我急了，急的跑下樓去，找着×君，×君說，我下樓的時候，你的皮袍分明在呢。於是我便跑到窗檻臨向的院落裏，向着這個，答說沒有見到，問着那個，也不知道。</p>
<p>就在不到十分鐘的短時間裏，我的皮袍失竊靠實了。</p>
<p>二樓是學生宿舍，低層是校工的住房，前頭是一座校内的老虎灶。這狹窄而又荒蕪的院落，平日我憑窗外望，慣常是沒有雜人的，學生從沒有一個到過這兒，有的就只有老虎灶的小工在這兒穿梭，娘姨在這兒洗曬衣服，有時有其他的一二位校工，陰不搭陽的在厮混。　　然而我去向這應負責任實有可疑的人員究問，他們都矢口不認。實爲着我是先生，他們是校工；若用某種恐嚇的對策，自己了不忍心幹，别人也不會同情；我的皮袍就這樣失落了。毫無辦法。然而我是多麽的焦灼呵。</p>
<p>幾十隻老洋做的一件衣，是自己唯一的財産，僅僅穿過兩屆，還是半新的啦。久就有這麽一個計劃，入秋把它配上一個新面，冬天還能向朋輩示嚴呢，好一件皮袍啦。</p>
<p>唉，幾天以來，我回憶着這皮袍的購置，是多少血汗的凝結，而今失落了，冬季將會怎樣的恐怖，使得我一刻兒也不能安神，嗚呼，寒門不幸，遭此失竊，除了咽下淚水，還得合十唸聲阿彌陀佛。</p>

<p>— 羅伽</p>
<p>雷，是象徴着一個新時代的開始。　　酷熱的夏天，天邊尋不出一片雲彩，驕陽放射着萬道的熱流。靑翠的樹葉子，一片片卷攏了，顯得非常的疲乏。人家的屋瓦，乾燥得快要爆裂，正如一個旅行於沙漠中的旅客，急需一口凉爽的淸水。野狗拖着尾巴，伸出舌頭，伏在牆陰裏喘氣。人們更是焦灼得想跳進一潭碧水裏，舒服一下，每一個人的心頭，都有着快將炙死的畏懼。</p>
<p>突然，在這不堪酷熱的時候，天空裏，猛然地來了一個震耳欲聾的霹靂。霎時間，一片片，一棄棄的雲聚攏來，集合成烏黑的一團，像拳頭那麽大的雨，如同决了堤的黃河一樣，灑遍了每一塊，將要晒焦了的泥土。閃爍的電光，轟隆的巨雷，合奏着一曲世界上最完美的力的音樂。</p>
<p>半嚮，雨住了，雷也停了，天是靑碧的，地是混潤的。以前逼人欲死的酷熱，已經被偉大的巨雷所消滅，於是，人們的心頭，都感到不可言說的舒適，愉悅，正如從一個陰燥窒息的地窟裏出來，到了一個空氣淸新的原野。這時，誰都以爲是他們已經走入了另一個適宜於生存的世界，沒有驕陽的兇燄，窒人呼吸的空氣，以及螫人的蚊蠅。</p>
<p>現在，我們是在這個炙人欲死的環境裏，</p>

<p>(Beiping) After the Japanese forcibly occupied Jehol and appointed Zhang Hai-peng as the puppet governor, Zhang recruited over three thousand of Tang Yulin's remnants and bandits in Jehol to form puppet troops, stationed in Chengde and Luanping for training. After a year, on the 5th of this month, the Japanese army suddenly ordered the disarming of Zhang's three thousand puppet troops, giving each person ten Japanese yen and a blue cotton shirt before sending them away. Those who were from the Northeast were sent to the Jin-Chao Road by automobile, and then under Japanese supervision, boarded trains to return to their original homes. Those who were not from the Northeast all took a detour on foot to enter through the passes. Recently, many have entered through Baimaguan and Dashuiyu. This is the initial step by the Japanese to eliminate the puppet troops. (Special dispatch, 8th)</p>

<p>(London) The military observation mission led by Yang Jie has recently completed its trip to England and is about to depart for the continent. When Yang met with a reporter from the North China Daily News today, he expressed extreme excitement about the results of this visit to observe the construction of the army, navy, and air force in England. Yang recounted his pleasant trip to England and the hospitality he received everywhere, saying that he was very happy to have had the opportunity to examine the contents of the British army, navy, and air force in detail. He continued that the Chinese have long known that the British navy is unmatched. What he saw on board the British battlecruiser HMS Renown confirmed this. However, the Chinese suspected that the British army was slightly inferior to its navy. However, he was amazed by the completeness, precision, discipline, and efficiency of the British army he saw during his trip to England. He was also impressed by the British tanks. Comparing the British army with the French army, he felt that the French were too liberal and not as disciplined. This was probably because the French army was mostly composed of conscripts, while the British were mostly professionals. Yang did not express an opinion on which of the two countries' military systems was superior. Yang then spoke about Germany, saying that the German army had restored its pre-war capabilities and efficiency and commented on Germany's iron discipline and the pervasiveness of the military spirit throughout the country. Yang was introduced to German Chancellor Hitler by the former German advisor to China. He said that he had previously thought that Hitler would be a fierce and bellicose person, but after meeting him, he realized that he was gentle, broad-minded, and knowledgeable. Yang then talked about Soviet Russia, saying that he was deeply moved by the might of the Red Army. The soldiers of the Red Army all occupied a special position and enjoyed all kinds of rights that ordinary people did not have. The officers and soldiers protected each other and were very close. The Soviet army was clearly very different from what it used to be. Yang then said that he had a long conversation with the British Secretary of State for War, Hore-Belisha, who inquired in detail about the current situation in China, and paid particular attention to the Communist Party. Yang was instructed by the Nanjing government to shorten his trip and not go to the United States, but he plans to visit the Bofors armaments factory in Sweden and plans to visit England again to watch the Royal Air Force's exercises on June 30, as he is eager to see the use of anti-aircraft guns.

<h3 id="e23">On the Dispute and Resolution of War Debt Issues <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>Since the Lausanne Conference concluded the year before last, the issue of reparations had essentially come to a close. However, the war debt issue, despite the World Economic Conference last year, has not been substantively discussed by the involved nations and remains an open question between the United States and various European countries. Judging from Britain's recent refusal to continue paying war debts to the United States, the only way to resolve this issue is through substantial concessions from the United States. Otherwise, complications may arise, affecting the decisions of the Lausanne Conference and potentially reigniting the reparations issue. After the Lausanne Conference, Britain, France, Italy, and Belgium signed a "Gentleman's Agreement," the gist of which was: if Germany's creditor nations do not reach a satisfactory resolution on the debt issue with their own creditor nations, they will not ratify the Lausanne Agreement. If such an unsatisfactory resolution occurs, the signatory nations' stance toward Germany will revert to the pre-Hoover Moratorium situation. Analyzing the implications of these words, it is clear that Britain and France aim to treat war debts and reparations as one and the same. They seem to believe that since reparations were reduced by nine-tenths due to the Lausanne Agreement, war debts should also be reduced by a proportional amount. If war debts cannot be reduced proportionally, the Lausanne Agreement cannot take effect and will become worthless. Therefore, unless the United States makes concessions, there is no way to resolve the war debt issue. If war debts cannot be resolved, the effectiveness of the Lausanne Conference will also disappear, leading to a resurgence of the reparations dispute. Is this not something to be concerned about?</p>
<p>From a legal standpoint, reparations are compensation demanded by victorious nations from defeated nations, while war debts are loans obtained from friendly nations to engage in war. The nature of the two is vastly different and cannot be treated as one and the same. However, it is questionable whether the war debts owed by Britain, France, and other countries to the United States can be viewed as ordinary economic loans between nations. These loans were primarily for munitions and food, with the sole purpose of aiding friendly nations in achieving victory in the war, and their use was solely for destruction. They cannot be compared to loans for productive purposes. After the end of the European War, Britain, France, and other countries mostly advocated for the cancellation of war debts, but the United States insisted otherwise. As a result, all nations took full compensation from Germany, creating an inseparable relationship between reparations and war debts. Therefore, the war debt agreements previously signed between the United States and European countries set 1987 as the final repayment deadline. The Yang Plan stipulated that Germany would pay reparations until only one year before that. The intent was to use reparations as the sole source for repaying war debts, which is clearly evident. Simultaneously, each country divided the Yang Plan's reparations into two phases. The first phase of reparations, in addition to being used as income for each country, was used to repay war debts. The second phase of reparations was solely for each country to repay war debts. This division further linked reparations and war debts. In addition to this, when signing the Yang Plan, Britain, France, Italy, and Belgium also reached an agreement with Germany, stipulating that if Britain, France, Italy, and Belgium negotiated a reduction in war debts with their own creditor nations, then Germany's reparations would also be reduced accordingly. At this point, reparations and war debts became as interdependent as the sides of a chariot. The United States is well aware of this relationship. Therefore, in 1931, when Germany faced a financial crisis and appealed to all nations to allow it to suspend reparations payments, Hoover resolutely issued an order to suspend war debt payments for one year. If war debts were not suspended, reparations could not be suspended alone. Therefore, if war debts are not substantially reduced, reparations cannot be reduced either. The approval of the Lausanne Agreement by all nations remains uncertain and depends on the attitude of the United States.</p>
<p>Since the European War, the United States has transformed from a debtor nation to a major creditor nation. As a major creditor nation, it still seeks to raise its tariff barriers, preventing European goods from entering its market. Having tightly closed the doors of its domestic market, it also seeks to use its powerful national strength to compete with the depleted European market for overseas markets. According to economic principles, a debtor nation can repay its creditor nation with cash if the amount is small. If the amount is too large, it can only be repaid through a trade surplus. Conversely, if a creditor nation wants to recover a large amount of foreign debt, it must absorb the debtor nation's goods. Otherwise, it will be impossible to recover the debt. Since the Great War, to protect its industries that excessively expanded during the war, the United States has been unwilling to sacrifice overseas markets and cannot absorb the goods of European nations. Therefore, it is impossible for other countries to repay war debts. Furthermore, the war debts lent by the United States to European nations were not cash but mostly goods such as munitions and food. In terms of reason and logic, the United States should also expect its European debtor nations to repay with goods. Otherwise, if it neither accommodates the goods of others nor is willing to substantially reduce the amount of war debts, the war debt issue will remain an unresolved case forever.</p>
<p>Economists often say that the current global economic downturn is due to many reasons, but the problems of reparations and war debts are the most significant. If these two issues are not appropriately resolved, international trade cannot be adjusted. Nations with scarce capital cannot increase their purchasing power, and even nations with abundant capital will inevitably suffer from trade decline and loan losses. Therefore, for the United States, it should understand this crux and quickly seek to reduce war debts, so that the Lausanne Agreement, which was painstakingly reached in the past, will not become a mere piece of paper. This would greatly contribute to the recovery of the world economy.</p>
<h3 id="e24">National Government Orders Abolition of Excessive Taxes and Miscellaneous Levies <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government issued an order on the 8th stating: "Taking from the people with a system is an ancient principle, and establishing the nation on agriculture should solidify the foundation of the country. The nation has faced frequent troubles in recent years, and expenditures have increased daily. Provincial and municipal governments often levy additional taxes outside of regular taxes, without any restrictions. The decline of rural areas is due to this. Active reorganization should be carried out to remedy this situation. The Ministry of Finance, in compliance with the order, has convened a National Finance Conference and thoroughly discussed and agreed on practical measures to reduce land tax surcharges, abolish miscellaneous taxes, reorganize legal taxes, and broaden the allocation of funds for local undertakings according to the original plan for implementation separately. Each provincial and municipal government should immediately instruct its subordinates to comply uniformly. From the date of the promulgation of this order, no additional surcharges are allowed on land tax, and no new illegal tax categories are allowed. This should be established as a fixed rule, and each local government should issue notices and post them in prominent places so that every household is aware. Any responsible personnel who neglect official duties, act insincerely, or create pretexts to deceive will be severely punished without leniency once discovered. Each provincial and municipal government should also share the difficulties of the times and earnestly investigate and prohibit such practices to fulfill the central government's earnest intention to revitalize the countryside and cultivate the foundation of the nation." This order was issued by the Central News Agency on the 8th.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Shao Hongji expressed his willingness to work at the lower levels of politics. When he went to Jiangxi to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Chiang asked Shao to serve as a county magistrate in Jiangxi. Shao specifically submitted a request to the Supervisory Yuan from Jiangxi, asking to resign from his position as a member of the Supervisory Committee. The original request stated that he had served as a member of the Supervisory Committee for three years without making any contributions. Now that the national crisis is becoming increasingly serious, he deeply feels that empty words cannot alleviate the difficulties. After repeated consideration, he can only ask to resign and enter the local area to engage in lower-level political work, hoping to awaken the people to jointly save the country from danger.

<h3 id="e40">U.S. Compromise Proposal Passed: Disarmament Conference Temporarily Adjourns; Contacts Made Outside the Conference to Urge Germany to Return; Anglo-French Discord Happily Dissipated; Henderson's Proposal Automatically Withdrawn <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) France and Britain today formally accepted the compromise proposal of the U.S. representative, Davis. As such, the disarmament conference will temporarily adjourn, pending progress in private talks to urge Germany to return to Geneva, before deciding on the next steps. The British government sent its official letter of approval at 11:00 AM this morning, and the French government also expressed its acceptance last night. Therefore, the meeting of the steering committee at 2:45 PM this afternoon can approve it.</p>
<p>According to sources in official circles, the Davis proposal advocates that Germany must be persuaded to return to the conference, which can be achieved through talks outside the conference. The Davis proposal is the same as the French Foreign Minister Barthou proposal in form, and includes the recommendation of the disarmament conference chairman Henderson, while making three major revisions to the Barthou proposal as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Give special explanation for Germany's return to the conference.</p>
<p>(2) Explain the necessity of conducting negotiations based on the 1934 memorandum of Britain, France, Italy, and Germany.</p>
<p>(3) Advocate the establishment of a Security Committee, whose organization and powers are limited to dealing with security pacts.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the Davis proposal actually advocates that the current conference be adjourned pending the outcome of informal talks with Germany.</p>
<p>According to semi-official sources, the French Ambassador to Germany, Ponsot, spoke with German diplomats in Berlin and proposed that Germany, Soviet Russia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the Baltic countries conclude a mutual assistance pact, with France as its guarantor. In addition, Soviet Russia would join the 1925 Locarno Security Pact. (National News Agency dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Davis compromise proposal has been submitted to the steering committee by the French delegation. The proposal stipulates that during the recess of the disarmament conference, the disarmament work will continue to be handled by the committees. The First Committee will study security issues, the Second Committee will study the implementation safeguards of the disarmament treaty, the Third Committee will study the reduction of air forces, and the Fourth Committee will study the management of the transportation and sales of ordnance and munitions. (National News Agency dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The disarmament steering committee, on the suggestion of France and Britain, accepted the Davis compromise proposal and submitted it to the Disarmament General Committee for discussion. (National News Agency dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) When the Disarmament General Committee met at 4:15 PM this afternoon, French Foreign Minister Barthou spoke, praising the friendly assistance of British representative Eden and U.S. representative Davis, saying that his previous remarks were slightly激昂, causing rumors of disagreement between Britain and France, but this statement is unfounded. Friendship has always been the foundation of Anglo-French policy, and even if there are slight differences, they are quickly dissipated. The spirit of mutual understanding and goodwill still exists today. France has never intended to adopt a policy of containment against Germany. (Reuters dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) U.S. representative Davis, who attended the disarmament conference, told reporters after the steering committee adjourned this afternoon that he believed this compromise proposal was truly valuable and very fair, and a constructive suggestion that should be considered as a result. The disarmament issue can definitely achieve real progress from this. Both France and Britain seem to acknowledge that for the sake of reaching a compromise, Germany must participate.

<h3 id="e41">Disarmament Steering Committee Meeting: Atmosphere Suddenly Turns Optimistic; Barthou Plays Hide-and-Seek with Eden; Henderson's Proposal Receives Nurturing from a Foster Mother <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) After the leaders of the three major delegations, namely British Eden, French Barthou, and U.S. Davis, consulted, the main obstacle to the progress of the disarmament conference, namely the issue of persuading Germany to return to the conference, has been eliminated. Therefore, when the steering committee reconvened at 2:50 PM this afternoon, the atmosphere had turned optimistic, and everyone seemed to be in a joyful mood. Before Barthou met Eden, he lightly probed his side with his hand and then hid behind him, causing laughter among the onlookers.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the meeting, Henderson gave a speech stating that the steering committee had extended its meeting on Wednesday in an effort to reconcile the resolution proposed by Barthou and himself. He asked the delegations that co-sponsored his resolution to agree to withdraw the proposal. Henderson then made a humorous remark, saying that his proposal had been nurtured by a foster mother and had changed its form, but he was satisfied that its limbs were not dismembered. He then formally moved to withdraw his proposal. Barthou then rose to speak, presenting the compromise proposal agreed upon by the leaders of the three major delegations, which contained France's concession to Britain's request for special attention to inviting Germany to return to the conference, and contained the necessary recognition of studying security issues. The proposal also stipulated the simultaneous resumption of the work of the General Committee and the Political Committee. Barthou made humorous remarks when presenting the proposal, saying that he hoped everyone would recognize him as a good foster mother, not only protecting the baby's limbs but also protecting its brain. Italian representative Soragna rose after the proposal was passed and said that Italy always felt that some special issues must have a good solution before any work can be completed smoothly. This statement probably meant that Italy did not want to participate in the committees to be organized by the General Committee next Tuesday. The Polish representative then announced Poland's reservation regarding the memorandum of the four major powers of January 1, 4, 29, and April 16, because the four major powers did not consult with Poland when submitting it. Finally, Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov announced that he intended to reserve his comments made in the General Committee. The steering committee then adjourned so that the General Committee could meet at 4:00 PM this afternoon.</p>
<p>It is generally expected that after a short meeting, the General Committee will announce its adjournment. The committees to be organized will deal with the issues of aerial bombardment, the manufacture and trade of munitions, and the guarantee of treaty implementation. The issue of security will be dealt with by the Political Committee.</p>
<p>Italy did not participate when the leaders of the three major delegations consulted on the compromise proposal this morning. Informed sources here expect this to be a reserved position, allowing Italy to act as a mediator in the future. Italian representative Alessio has previously succeeded in mediating the Saar issue, so he is best suited to act as a peacemaker. (Reuters dispatch on the 8th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The all-night meeting of the representatives of the U.S., Britain, and France lasted for seven hours. It was learned this morning that Britain and France could fully agree to Germany's return to the disarmament conference. The representatives of the three countries will continue to meet at the residence of U.S. representative Davis on Friday morning to study the final compromise proposal and submit it to the disarmament steering committee meeting that afternoon. Representatives who participated in the meeting last night and this morning declared that if cooperation can proceed in accordance with the current spirit, an agreement can be reached within half an hour. Observers here believe that the French delegation has indeed changed its attitude towards Germany's return to the disarmament conference. France's change of its firm attitude, or its trend towards agreeing to disarmament, has aroused deep concern, as the French delegation announced the end of the conference 48 hours ago. (National News Agency dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Last night, the leaders of the three major delegations to the disarmament conference, namely British Eden, French Barthou, and U.S. Davis, held an important meeting. Reporters learned afterwards that the overall situation had improved greatly. It was heard that the three leaders had agreed on the full text of the resolution, which would be submitted to the governments of the countries with representatives attending the disarmament conference for approval. The steering committee meeting, originally scheduled to be held at 10:30 AM this morning, has been changed to 2:45 PM this afternoon. The General Committee is scheduled to meet at 4:00 PM. The news that the three leaders have agreed on the resolution has rekindled hope that the disarmament conference will not completely fail and break up. (Reuters dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) French Foreign Minister Barthou, British representative Eden, and American representative Davis met tonight to discuss the situation of the disarmament conference. As it was dinner time, they dined together. Barthou called it a "working dinner" and worked together to draft a draft resolution so that the Presidium and the General Committee could agree. Barthou said to others that this conversation can be regarded as the best sign, but he did not explain the reason for the hope, only saying "Since I arrived in Geneva, I have never been as optimistic as today." Barthou originally planned to return to Paris on Friday, but now he says he has changed his departure to Saturday. Barthou said that postponing the trip seems to be more conducive to progress. Barthou also met with Swedish Foreign Minister Sandler this afternoon, who is the spokesperson for the representatives of the six small countries of Sweden, Switzerland, Norway, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Spain. (Havas dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The French side officially declared that after the meeting between French Foreign Minister Barthou, British representative Eden, and American representative Davis last night, the situation of the disarmament conference has greatly improved. It is generally hoped that a draft resolution may be submitted for discussion at the Presidium meeting this afternoon. However, this draft must first be sorted out by the representatives of the relevant countries and then seek the consent of the representatives of other countries. In this case, the General Committee cannot but postpone the meeting until the morning of Saturday. The period of French Foreign Minister Barthou's stay in Geneva will be extended by another 24 hours.

<p>(Washington) There is better hope for the Geneva disarmament conference, and the news here is quite satisfactory. The American delegation still maintains a distant attitude towards the negotiations of the disarmament conference. However, the United States is unwilling to advise on purely European issues, but still fully assists in disarmament. It is heard that the reason why Britain and the United States are strongly opposed to the proposal of regional security pacts is that they are afraid that it will create a bad precedent. If a meeting is called in the Pacific in the future, and Soviet Russia requests to conclude a Pacific security pact based on the existing treaty, Britain and the United States will be unable to refuse. If there is a conflict in the Pacific in the future, both Britain and the United States will be unable to avoid it.</p>

<p>(Washington) It was learned today that the United States Navy is now preparing to expand its air force and complete the aircraft carrier tonnage allowed by the Washington and London Naval Treaties as the first step in its plan. The United States Navy currently has two old aircraft carriers, the Saratoga and the Lexington, with a total displacement of 66,000 tons. In addition, there is the Langley, with 10,286 tons, but the Langley is not within the treaty limits. Since the launching of the 13,800-ton Ranger last week, the total tonnage of US aircraft carriers has increased to 79,800 tons, excluding the Langley. In addition, there are two aircraft carriers that have either been laid down or approved for construction, each with a displacement of about 10,000 tons. The London Naval Treaty allows the United States to possess 135,000 tons of aircraft carriers, so after the two new ships are built, the US Navy will still be short 15,200 tons. British aircraft carriers are also limited to 135,000 tons, but Britain already has six new-style aircraft carriers, totaling 115,350 tons. The London Treaty allows Japan to possess 81,000 tons of aircraft carriers, and Japan already has 68,370 tons, with one 10,000-ton ship under construction, so Japan's aircraft carriers will soon increase to 78,370 tons. The head of the Navy Department's Aviation Bureau, Kinnear, stated that he hopes to raise the funds to complete his plan in the next fiscal year. (National, 7th)</p>

<p>The Rome Genoa Daily News commented on the war debt issue, saying, "Italy will adopt the same attitude as Britain regarding the war debts owed to the United States.

<h3 id="e51">International Labor Conference Discusses 40-Hour Workweek: Britain and France Oppose, Italy Agrees <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The International Labor Conference opened this morning. The French employer representative stated his views on the 40-hour workweek, saying that if the Labor Office is confident that reducing working hours will significantly reduce the number of unemployed without hindering economic recovery, then the 40-hour workweek can be adopted. Otherwise, it is best not to implement it. He believes that the working class increasing their purchasing power will not get a worthwhile price. In his opinion, once the 40-hour workweek is implemented, production costs will increase by 10% to 20%, and the efficiency of each worker will not increase, nor will the working methods improve. The result is nothing more than a deliberate expansion policy, which will worsen the poverty of the general public and affect economic recovery. The opinions of several governments are the same. When the meeting reconvened in the afternoon, the British government representative, Ledger, said that it seemed too early to conclude a convention to reduce working hours at this time, but this issue may be requested for study by the governments of various countries. The Italian government representative, Michaelis, immediately stated that with the progress of modern industrial technology, the weekly working hours must be reduced to 40 hours. Mr. Michaelis said that the Italian government believes that the need to reduce working hours is progressing with the times. Subsequently, the Australian labor representative and the Spanish government representative gave speeches. The conference then submitted the resolution proposed by the labor representative group to a vote. The resolution advocated that the report of the International Labor Office should be used as the basis for discussing working hours and that it should be sent to a special committee for review. In the end, it passed by a majority of 71 votes to 22, with several abstentions. The French representative voted in favor. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The International Labor Conference has had a special development today. Several labor and employer representatives have decided to oppose the continued discussion of the 40-hour workweek. Limiting the weekly working hours to 40 hours in order to reduce world unemployment was originally an important agenda item of the conference, and the International Labor Office also made recommendations to the governments of various countries in the hope of concluding an international convention to regulate working hours. The International Labor Office had tried its best to promote the 40-hour workweek, but it was interrupted by the opposition of the British government and British employers. This system was decided to be left for discussion this year after a fierce debate at last year's conference. This system was originally proposed by the Italian representative in the name of Mussolini. The US representative also expressed great support for this proposal. (National, 8th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) When the International Labor Office reconvened this morning, the employer representatives declared that they would not participate in the review committee's discussion on the 44-hour workweek, but would strive to have the conference reject this plan.

<p>(London) The British Fascist League, chaired by Sir Mosley, held a meeting at Olympia Hall tonight. At that time, thousands of people gathered near the hall. Communist parties and others clashed with the Blackshirt members, and the conflict intensified. Seeing that the situation was not good, the police waved their batons to drive them away. At the same time, hundreds of reinforcements rushed to help suppress them. There was no peace from then on. While the conflict was going on outside the door, Sir Mosley's speech to the audience was repeatedly obstructed by listeners, but they were all driven out by the hall attendants. Among the attendants were female Fascist members who occasionally used fists and feet and used chairs as weapons. Only after fierce fighting were the troublemakers driven out of the meeting place. When the meeting ended, disturbances broke out again outside the door, but a large team of party members was escorted away by mounted police. Dozens of people were injured in the conflict, one of whom was</p>
<p>seriously injured and has been sent to the hospital, and it is feared that he will not survive. Twenty-three people have been detained by the police and will be punished. (Reuters, 7th)</p>

A total of 15,000 people attended the conference, and 1,500 police officers were dispatched to maintain order. The well-trained Fascist Party members were initially able to deal with the communist disruption, but later a small number of Fascist Party members were beaten, their black shirts were torn, and some people were injured so badly that they could not move and were helped away by their comrades.

<p>(London) According to the "Financial News," the British government will adopt a quantity restriction method for silk imports in the short term. This matter has been decided, but special consideration will be given to French silk to avoid damage. The newspaper briefly stated, "The British government has decided to adopt this method. This is the first time that Britain has restricted the quantity of industrial goods imports. It will be implemented through special laws. However, it is not yet possible to determine whether the quantity restriction method will apply equally to silk products from all countries or will be limited to Japanese products. According to the government's intention, it is extremely desirable to prevent Japanese silk industry competition, but under certain conditions, there are difficulties in not hindering the import of French silk. According to the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty, Britain cannot take discriminatory measures against Japanese goods in terms of tariffs, and if it wants to prevent Japanese competition through tariffs, it will not be effective unless the tax rate is raised to more than 250%. Therefore, it is better to adopt a quantity restriction method. The government has sought expert opinions on whether the quantity restriction method, if applied only to Japan, would constitute discriminatory treatment, and the experts' opinions vary. It is estimated that the government will apply it equally to all countries, but in order to take care of France, it will take the year most favorable to France and most unfavorable to Japan as the standard for determining the import quantity. The year that meets these conditions is 1930." (Havas, 8th) (Tokyo) According to Toho News, the government of Jamaica in the British West Indies has passed a bill in the second reading of its parliament to implement a quota system for imported silk and rayon fabrics, with the aim of restricting imports of Japanese goods.

<p>(Batavia) The first formal Dutch-Japanese conference opened at the Art Association at 11:00 this morning. The Japanese side was represented by Representative Nagaoka, Consul General Koshida, and various advisors and staff members. The Dutch East Indies side was represented by Representatives Lanaufte and Von Linston, as well as various committee members. First, Mr. Lan gave an opening speech, the main points of which are as follows:</p>
<p>"Before the start of the conference, the turbulent atmosphere between the two countries has now calmed down. It is an excellent opportunity to proceed with the conference in a calm atmosphere. As for the matters that should be decided at this conference, it is not possible to say now. However, the actions of the Dutch East Indies must adapt to changes in the world situation, and there will be no offensive motivation. It is only necessary to respond to necessities and seek to protect itself. Future international trade must adapt to newly emerging events. Therefore, the Dutch East Indies will begin to conclude new agreements with various countries based on this policy. It has had trade relations with Japan for centuries, and it is a great honor to discuss this issue with Japan for the first time."</p>
<p>Next, Japanese Representative Nagaoka gave a reply, saying:</p>
<p>"At the luncheon, the Governor stated his views on Dutch-Japanese trade, saying that the Dutch-Japanese relationship has not changed to this day, and it will inevitably be pure in the future. I express my sympathy. The relationship between the two countries is permanent. As for economic life, it must be changed according to the situation, so it should not be confined to temporary phenomena, and exaggerate the value of it. Although it is appropriate to seek appropriate measures for temporary misfortunes, one must not forget the optimism of the future. If one discusses minor disadvantages and wastes time, it will shake the international order. Therefore, we must uphold the principle of coexistence and co-prosperity, the spirit of cooperation and compromise, and maintain a special friendly relationship in order to enhance the friendship between the two countries. We intend to approach it with the best of efforts."</p>
<p>After the speeches, the Dutch side proposed that the agenda of future meetings should be decided after further consultation. The meeting ended here, but the representatives of the two countries continued to hold informal consultations to discuss the agenda and procedures. The Japanese side hopes that before discussing specific issues,</p>
<p>the Dutch East Indies will abolish the import restriction order. Therefore, depending on the Dutch side's approach, waves may occur at the beginning of the meeting. The date of the second meeting has not yet been decided. (Denstu, 8th)</p>

<p>(Washington) Japanese goods exported to South America in 1933 increased threefold compared to 1931. Japan's commercial progress in Argentina, Peru, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, and other countries is very rapid. Japan's woolen textile industry in 1933</p>
<p>purchased a large amount of wool from Argentina and Chile, thus forming a balance of reciprocal commodities. However, this balance ultimately benefits Japan. Among the goods exported from Japan to South America in 1933, cotton textiles occupied the most important position, especially cotton textiles exported to Argentina. Cotton textiles exported to Argentina in 1933 amounted to approximately 6,616,000 Japanese yen, while in 1931 they were 1,408,000 Japanese yen. Japan's trade in Central America is developing even faster than in South America. It also profits greatly in Cuba, Mexico, and the Panama Canal Zone. Japan has a large trade surplus in the Central American region. In 1933, Japanese goods exported to Central America totaled 16,175,000 Japanese yen. In the same year, Japanese goods imported from Central America were worth 438,000 yen. Although Cuba and Mexico purchased large quantities of Japanese goods,</p>
<p>the two countries' goods failed to be imported into Japan in large quantities. (National, 7th)</p>

<p>(Moscow) The Soviet government is now banning trivial official documents. From now on, officials who are good at writing will either be imprisoned or sent to Siberia.

<p>(Honolulu) The President Lincoln, a ship of the Dollar Steamship Company, caught fire in its No. 7 cargo hold yesterday, and a radio warning was issued. This morning, the ship arrived here under its own power, escorted by a Coast Guard cutter and a Navy fireboat. Although the President Lincoln showed no signs of fire, lifeboats had been lowered, and some passengers were still wearing life jackets. The fire in the burning cargo hold had not been completely extinguished, and the fireboat was still pouring water on it. The public</p>
<p>believes that the cargo was heated and caught fire on its own, but the captain suspects that someone set the fire in hopes of destroying the ship. According to passengers, after receiving the fire alarm signal after dinner, they entered the lifeboats together, not panicking at all, and sat quietly in the boats to wait. It was not until midnight that they learned that the danger had disappeared. An Englishman, Brown, was one of the passengers. He told a Reuters reporter about the fire, saying that thick smoke spewed out from the cargo hold, blinding people. The lifeboats were lowered one after another, ready for passengers to board in case of emergency. The passengers all put on life jackets, and everything was very orderly, with no panic. A British woman, Mrs. Hansford, said that the ship's band was still playing music when the fire broke out, and some passengers were even dancing, while the crew tried their best to comfort the passengers, saying that there was no reason to panic. The President Lincoln departed from New York on May 10 for the Far East, carrying 60 passengers and a crew of 200. After discovering the fire in the cargo hold, it immediately sent out a distress radio. Before long, several merchant ships and warships rushed to help, but upon arrival, they learned that the fire had subsided and was not worth worrying about. (Reuters, 8th)</p>

<p>A report from Beijing: In order to arrange the Nishihara Loans, the Japanese side has recently been actively using Wang Yitang to restore the China and Foreign Trust Bank and sending Uchida to China to negotiate with our country. Uchida has now returned to Japan to participate in the Nishihara Loans arrangement meeting jointly organized by the East Asia Industrial Development Bank, the Korea Bank, and the Taiwan Bank. It is reported that he will come to China again immediately after the meeting. As for Sakanishi, an important figure in the Japanese military who has been active in the Pingjin area, he has gone south from Pingjin a few days ago and also has the mission of negotiating the Nishihara Loans with our country. Sakanishi is currently in Shanghai and is reportedly actively working and will visit Duan Qirui, Huang Fu, and others to discuss this matter. It has recently been learned that Sakanishi visited important figures in our country a few days ago and discussed the Nishihara Loans and the restoration of the China and Foreign Trust Bank. The current National Government Executive Yuan authorities are working with relevant agencies to review the principles of arranging foreign debts. The Foreign Debt Arrangement Committee will also be restored soon. Therefore, the Japanese side has decided to make every effort to negotiate the arrangement of old debts. Ambassador Arichi, who is returning to China from Japan, has also been instructed to focus on arranging old debts in his negotiations with our country. This policy of the Japanese side is worthy of attention. It is also learned that the Japanese side claims that the total amount of old debts, including principal and interest, is 734,770,000 Japanese yen. According to its content, the Ministry of Finance owes 142,354,000 Japanese yen, the Railway owes 164,209,000 Japanese yen, the Ministry of Communications owes 75,600,000 Japanese yen, military loans amount to 102,559,000 Japanese yen, and the industrial sector owes 245,090,000 Japanese yen. Among these old debts, the Nishihara Loans are the largest and the most difficult to arrange. The Japanese side has decided to first raise the issue of the Nishihara Loans and negotiate with our country in the hope of obtaining a definitive guarantee. According to the Japanese announcement, the so-called Nishihara Loans include a 20 million yen loan from the Bank of Communications, a 20 million yen loan for wired telecommunications, a 10 million yen loan for the Jihui Railway, a 20 million yen loan for participation in the war, a 20 million yen loan for the Shandong Railway, a 20 million yen loan for the four Manchurian-Mongolian Railways, and a 10 million yen loan for the Jilin-Heilongjiang Forestry and Mining Railway, totaling 140 million Japanese yen. Counting the interest over the past 17 years (the year the loan was established was 1918), it amounts to about 300 million Japanese yen. (Huate News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e98">Poisonous Atmosphere Permeates Luan East: Japanese and Korean Rogues Set Up Drug Institutions Everywhere; Daily Sales of Drugs Valued at 300,000 Yuan <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>A Tianjin correspondent reports that in recent months, the Japanese have been making every effort to sabotage various facilities in the counties of Luan East, so that the area falls into a state of permanent unrest, the people cannot catch their breath, and the source of chaos will naturally grow, from which Japan can profit. The most vicious of these plans is that within the 23 counties in the war zone, a poisonous atmosphere has spread everywhere. Institutions for selling morphine, heroin, opium, and gambling, even in the smallest villages and towns, have two or three establishments. The operators are all Japanese and Korean rogues who rely on extraterritoriality and the current special power of the Japanese to run rampant in cities and counties without any scruples. Although the Japanese side has repeatedly received our protests, they superficially promised to restrain them, but secretly helped the rogues expand. Even the transportation of drugs is often escorted by the official Japanese army, openly transporting them in military vehicles to supply various places. Local authorities have no recourse because the Japanese are unreasonable. According to a survey by the Provincial Government, the most severely affected counties include Fengrun, Changli, Luan County, Laoting, Linyu, Tang County, Zunhua, Qian'an, Lulong, and Funing, with an average of no less than 300 drug institutions in each county, for a total of more than 3,000 in the ten counties. Each drug institution sells an average of about 80 yuan of drugs per day, for a total of about 300,000 yuan per day. This is all cash flowing out, absorbed by the Japanese side to go away, so the people of each county are poor and the economy is exhausted to the extreme. Although the two wheat crops have been sown so far, farmers are addicted to smoking and gambling, resulting in the loss of cultivation. The amount of abandoned farmland is innumerable. The wealth in deserted villages has been exhausted, and even those who offer high-interest loans have nowhere to borrow money. The Provincial Government is quite concerned about the desolate conditions of each county and has instructed local magistrates to negotiate, but the Japanese side does not take it seriously. When the Provincial Government negotiates directly, the Japanese side equivocates, so there is no solution. In addition, the Japanese have recently ordered the puppet Ministry of Finance Salt Affairs Department to dump Yingkou salt in the war zone and eastern Chahar, greatly reducing prices. Salt is the basis of the people's food and a major source of revenue for our Lux salt tax. Since the dumping of puppet salt, the position of Lux salt has deteriorated. The revenue from Lux salt donations in May was only over 900,000, more than 700,000 less than in the same month last year and more than 300,000 less than last month. It can be seen that the invasion of puppet salt cannot be ignored. (6th)</p>

<p>A Guangzhou correspondent reports that the various armies in central Jiangxi have recently approached the bandit areas and recovered various places, immediately handling the aftermath. At the same time, deep trenches and high ramparts are being built to cut off the traffic of bandit areas and to cut off the supply of food and salt, implementing a policy of blockading bandit areas. The First and Second Columns of the Southern Route Army are particularly active in arranging the front blockade before the general attack on the bandit areas. As for the Xinfeng section of southern Jiangxi, which is an important point south of Yudu, a certain division is deploying heavy troops here. A Bandit Area Management Office has been established a few days ago, with a director who is concurrently the county magistrate, two clerks, a group leader for inspection, and a group leader for patrol. The entire county's blockade line is patrolled by two standing companies dispatched by the Anti-Communist Corps to assist various sub-offices and checkpoints in handling blockade affairs. In addition, due to the aftermath in southern Jiangxi, the Southern Jiangxi Administrative Office has expanded its organization, increasing its monthly budget by 2,000 yuan, for a total of 4,000 yuan including the original budget. In order to organize the regimental police in various parts of southern Jiangxi and unify command and training, the Southern Jiangxi Security Headquarters was established on the 1st of this month, with one commander and one deputy commander. The commander is concurrently the Administrative Commissioner Zhang Chi, and the deputy commander is filled by a lieutenant colonel officer dispatched by the First Army.

<h3 id="e100">Changsha City Chamber of Commerce: Opposing Additional Militia Levies; Additional Levies Violate Established Practice, Merchants Find Burden Unbearable <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Since Hunan Province successively established the Hunan Provincial Pacification Headquarters and the Security Command Headquarters and other agencies to be responsible for consolidating the militia defense of various counties, five or six years have passed. The entire province has been divided into six security districts, each governing several counties or as many as one or twenty counties. The militia defense within each district has been uniformly reorganized according to the national military system, with regiments as units, abolishing the original county boundaries, using numbers as serial numbers, and unifying the organization. In total, the militia teams of 75 counties in the province have been reorganized into 24 security regiments, one independent battalion, and one special service battalion. Previously, militia levies were managed independently by each county, but now they are uniformly collected by the government, specifically by adding five yuan to each tael of regular land tax, which can collect more than four million yuan annually. Additionally, a militia levy of two jiao is added to each mu of lake land, which can collect more than 800,000 yuan annually. The total of both items can collect five million yuan annually for application. Recently, the entire Fourth Route Army entered Jiangxi to suppress bandits, and the security of the Hunan border relies on the maintenance of these security regiments. A Militia Levy Supervision Committee was separately established within the Security Command Headquarters, with the government hiring one impartial gentry member from each of the six security districts to form the committee, supervising the revenue and expenditure of militia levies to demonstrate transparency. Currently, the committee anticipates that the revenue and expenditure of militia levies will be short by several hundred thousand yuan, so it has submitted a request to the government to increase three additional levies to supplement the funds: (1) add 10% to the production and sales tax, (2) add 30% to the business tax, and (3) add 30% to the brokerage tax. The Changsha City Chamber of Commerce, upon hearing the news, believes that the increase in militia levies would be difficult for merchants and residents to bear, and has risen up in opposition, telegraphing chambers of commerce in various counties and cities to jointly strive for a denial from the provincial government. The original petition states: "We learned from a report in this city's newspaper on the 24th of this month that the Hunan Militia Levy Supervision Committee proposed to add a militia levy of 10% to the production and sales tax in this province, and to add a militia levy of 30% to both the business tax and the brokerage tax. After reading this, we were extremely shocked. The militia levy has historically been added to the land tax of each county and has been in effect for many years. We have never heard of it being insufficient. Even if reorganization is carried out this time, it can only be to adjust the deficit and seek remedies under the land tax additions. It is absolutely impossible to violate established practice and increase the burden on merchants for no reason. Moreover, the production and sales tax is a disguised likin, and the tax rate is extremely high, which is not found in other provinces. Merchants endured temporary pain to alleviate the government's financial difficulties, which was a matter of expediency and originally unavoidable. However, since its implementation, merchants' capital has been increased accordingly, the people's purchasing power has weakened, and the commercial arena has declined day by day. Last year, another 20% was added. Merchants felt that the government did not care about the people's hardships and was taking an inch after gaining a foot, and their dissatisfaction had been simmering for a long time. They had hoped that the situation would become slightly more stable, the treasury would become slightly more abundant, and the government could fulfill its previous declarations and resolutely cancel the tax to show great faith. Unexpectedly, the Hunan Militia Levy Supervision Committee suddenly made this proposal. If it is implemented, it will not only put the commerce of this province in dire straits, but the regular tax will also be affected, resulting in a shortage of income. As for items such as brokerage tax, post fees, and public welfare donations, the burden is already considerable. At a time when the rural economy is bankrupt, various production and sales are sluggish, and brokerage firms are closing down, which is frequently heard. As for the business tax, the tax rate set in this province is also heavier than in other provinces, and Article 8 of the business tax law promulgated by the central government already stipulates that no additional taxes may be levied. We merchants are suffering from the layering of donations and taxes, and the pursuit of public bonds, and we are exhausted and unable to bear any more burdens. The gentlemen of the Militia Levy Supervision Committee are respected by the locality and must be aware of the suffering of merchants and residents. Why do they recklessly disregard this and adopt this measure of draining the pond to catch all the fish, which harms the people in the name of protecting them? After the association convened an executive and supervisory meeting for discussion, it was resolved to petition the provincial government to deny the additions and to send a letter to the Hunan Militia Levy Supervision Committee to voluntarily withdraw the record on file. In addition to separate letters, we hereby respectfully submit this petition for supervision and implementation in order to alleviate the difficulties of merchants and maintain the tax policy."

<h3 id="e101">Shandong Silkworm Cocoon Season Has Arrived; Sales Have No Way Out, the Scene Is Miserable <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The silk industry in Shandong Province has been depressed for years, with accumulated unsold stock. Silk merchants are suffering greatly, and many have even gone bankrupt due to financial difficulties. Therefore, since last year, silk factories in Yidu, Linqu, Changshan, and other counties with the most abundant cocoon production have completely closed down. When cocoon farmers carry their loads by cart to the factories, they are all rejected. Only the Japanese Suzuki Silk Factory buys them, but the supply exceeds the demand, and the Japanese make things difficult in every way. The value has been reduced to the lowest possible level, and cocoon farmers all endure it with their heads bowed. Later, Suzuki also refused to buy, and on the day it stopped buying, cocoon farmers carrying loads in carts stretched for several miles, sleeping outdoors for several nights, begging the Japanese to buy, but ultimately to no avail. Cocoon farmers all left in tears. This year, the Department of Construction believes that the silk industry is still inactive, and the resumption of silk factories is uncertain. Silkworm farmers have no way to sell. In order to provide relief, it plans to use the government's power to encourage farmers to organize cooperatives to sell on their behalf, to bake cocoons on their behalf to prevent moths from emerging, and to introduce bank loans so that cocoon farmers can be relieved. The plan is very thorough. The department sent technician Chen Shican, who is currently traveling to Yidu, Linqu, Changshan, and other counties to actively carry out the plan. According to Chen's report to the Department of Construction, new cocoons have been seen in Changshan and Yidu, and in three days, it will be the peak season. Linqu is later, and in about a week, it will also be the peak season. Currently, the cocoon price is 2 jiao and 2 fen per jin for white cocoons in Yidu (each jin of cocoons purchased in various counties is 24 liang), and 1 jiao and 8 fen per jin for yellow cocoons. Linqu is roughly the same. Zhoucun, because there is a need for local silk reeling factories, is 2 jiao and 1 fen per jin. In Yidu and Linqu counties, no Chinese silk factories are buying. The only one offering to buy is the Japanese Suzuki. Judging from this year's situation, there are still many silkworm farmers, but the number of buyers is limited, and there is no way to sell. The situation is even more miserable than last year, and relief is urgently needed. Regarding the issue of bank loans, the Bank of China has sent a special commissioner for rural lending, Yan Kelie, from the head office, who is currently in Yidu to negotiate. The bank is semi-automatic in nature and plans to set up temporary warehouses, mortgage loans, and bake and store cocoons on behalf of cocoon farmers. Doing so may provide some relief. As for organizing cooperatives, technicians from various counties have come one after another to organize offices in various counties. Farmers are all delighted and enthusiastically organizing. The degree of need is similar to that of the Qidong Cotton Industry Cooperative. Currently, there are 4 societies and 14 offices registered in Changshan, 27 offices in Yidu, and more than 200 offices in Linqu. More than 1,000 registration forms for voluntary organization have been collected. However, because the matter is urgent, if all the organizational work is carried out according to the formal procedures, it may delay the cocoon season. Therefore, the situation will be considered and handled in order to be rapid.</p>

<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Chairman Chiang Kai-shek convened the security directors of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces, as well as the regional security commanders of each province, for instructions at the Nanchang headquarters. The meeting was held on the 1st. There were no proposals at the meeting, and it was entirely focused on reports. On the morning of the 2nd, the security directors of each province completed their reports to the general assembly in turn. Then, Chiang delivered instructions, roughly saying, "The people's militia and police force are the basic military force of the people, and they should be strictly reorganized and trained to strengthen self-defense. The training of the people's militia should not only be limited to shooting and combat, but also require the teams to understand the current position and environment of our country so that they can faithfully perform their duties. The people of our country have little knowledge and lack organization and training. The training of the people's militia and baojia should start from small things. If each county can train 400 people each year, it will also be quite considerable in a year," and so on. The instructions lasted for more than an hour, and the meeting closed around 12:00. In the afternoon, the headquarters held a public banquet for the attending members in the auditorium and showed movies for entertainment. The meeting adjourned at 10:00 in the evening. It is said that the headquarters received more than 70 reports and suggestions from the security departments and regional commanders of each province. Each province and region gave detailed reports on the situation of local red bandits, the progress of operations and suppression, the general situation of the people's militia and police force, and the implementation of the baojia and people's organization. They also made various suggestions on the aftermath of bandit suppression, the reorganization of teams, the training of baojia, and self-defense facilities, etc. These have been compiled into a book, and after adding general comments and instructions, they will be distributed to each province for reference, either to follow and imitate, or to make corrections. Currently, the participants are still visiting the city defense works and all construction projects in the province. They plan to visit the front lines and then return to their respective duties.

A villager named Jin Shoutang, over forty years old, has a well-to-do family. However, he had no children, so he married a concubine two years ago, and last year she gave birth to a son, which was a great comfort to his life and a great joy. Last night, Shoutang was out and had not returned. Suddenly, four bandits with local accents broke into the house and kidnapped the child, wrapped in a cotton quilt. Jin's concubine rushed forward to snatch him back but was kicked to the ground. Jin's concubine cried and chased after them, but it was too late. The local police station has reported the case to Songjiang for arrest. The Water Patrol Team has dispatched two patrol boats to investigate.</p>

<p>Zhuangqiao in the fourth district of this county borders Shanghai County. The Shanghai Administrative Council proposed that the eight tu of Zhuangqiao and other places, although under the jurisdiction of Songjiang County, are closer to Shanghai County. Occasionally, administrative and judicial matters are more convenient in Shanghai. Therefore, it is appropriate to划归Shanghai County. The case was resolved and reported to the province to order Songjiang County to review and reply. Today, on the second day of the ninth administrative meeting, County Magistrate Jin raised the issue for discussion. The attendees unanimously opposed it and resolved to reply to the provincial department to deny it.</p>

It spread to the neighbors on the left and right. The fire brigades of the east and west streets of the town and Weidang and other places rushed to the rescue. As a result, the entire village was burned down, with losses of more than 20,000 yuan. During the firefighting, a firefighter named Jia from the east street threw a tile from the roof and hit Wei A'song, a firefighter from Weijiadang, in the leg, causing blood to flow profusely, which caused a dispute. Fortunately, the 15th Branch persuaded them, and the matter was temporarily resolved.</p>

<p>Since the completion of the Xicheng, Xiyi, and Xiyu roads, traffic has become increasingly convenient. Now, Gu Shuzhi, chairman of the Municipal Management Committee, is planning to build an outer ring road so that vehicles can travel from one village to another without having to pass through the crowded urban areas and to connect the various highways. The plan has already been drafted and will be carried out in three lines. The width of the road is set at 20 feet. The first line, from the Dai Gou Bridge at the South Gate to the junction of Kaiyuan Road, is easier to construct, and it has been decided to start with this section first. Qin Xiangtao from the Municipal Engineering Office of the Construction Bureau has completed the survey, which is 630 zhang long. The total cost of the first line of the project is estimated to be more than 3,000 yuan. It will be submitted for discussion at the regular meeting of the Municipal Management Committee this Saturday. Once the plan is approved, construction will begin immediately. In addition, Zhang, Director of the Construction Bureau, and the relevant district heads held a meeting yesterday to discuss the issue of adding culverts to the Xihu Road, Xiyu section. It was decided to find a flexible solution. The government will provide 70% of the required funds, and the remaining 30% will be raised by the villagers themselves.

<p>Qian Zhefu of Tianning Temple Lane in this county is a well-known opium trafficker in the county, but he is quite alert and has not been caught. His home has multiple mechanisms specifically for storing opium. The source of the opium is directly transported by steamboat from Shanghai, unloaded in the middle of the night, so few people know about it. On the 7th of this month, according to local reports, a patrol officer from the First Branch of the Public Security Station, acting on a tip, went to the Qian family and seized more than 40 packages of opium. The next day, the county government, acting on another tip, sent bailiff Lu Fusheng and others to the Qian family and cracked three mechanisms, seizing more than 800 packages of opium, and arrested his clerk, Shen Shulin, and Qian's wife, Gui, and brought them to the county. According to the confession, they do not traffic opium. Qian Zhefu works as a lawyer's assistant in Shanghai and does not often return home. The opium seized was inherited from his ancestors and stored here, etc. As a result, the two were detained. In addition, a fugitive, Qian Zhefu, was being arrested. However, the First Branch of the Public Security Station suddenly denied the opium seizure the day before and reported to the General Bureau for a review, saying that the report was inaccurate. However, Qian's neighbors in Tianning Temple Lane firmly stated that the opium was seized two days before and a large amount was taken away. According to a general rumor, on the afternoon of the 6th, the Qian's opium mechanism was cracked by the First Branch, which was indeed the case. However, afterwards, three tycoons came forward to intercede, asking for a fee of 5,000 yuan. As a result, 3,000 yuan was agreed upon. 1,600 yuan was paid in advance on the same day, and the remaining amount was promised to be paid on a later date. Unexpectedly, the tycoons embezzled 1,000 yuan and only distributed 600 yuan, resulting in unequal distribution, causing internal strife, and secretly reporting to the county government, resulting in the second major search.</p>

Subsequently, Yang Zhongyi and other citizens of the area submitted a request to the county government, arguing that the company belonged to a British merchant and that organizing an escort group in the area was related to the national system and seemed illegal. Later, County Magistrate Ma received an order from the department not to make any appointments and ordered Zhang Baoheng, the fifth district chief, to recall and revoke the appointment letter.</p>

<p>Zhengxiang Town, in the fifth district of Yuyao, is only a few miles from the county seat and boasts a thriving commercial sector. On the evening of the 5th, more than a dozen bandits suddenly appeared, each armed with wooden-cased guns and other weapons. They broke into the town and robbed six businesses, including Dingtai Meat Shop, Hong Maoxing Dried Goods Store, Zhang Xie Da General Store, and Xie He Sheng and He Liang Dried Goods Stores. A total of over three hundred silver dollars were stolen, as well as a pistol and a rifle belonging to Yu Pengfei, the owner of Dingtai Meat Shop. After receiving reports from villagers, the Yao County government dispatched police to pursue the bandits, but they had already fled without a trace. Six suspects were later apprehended southeast of Wulong Ridge and are currently under interrogation.</p>

<p>Zhang Baokang, a young owner of Juxing Tofu Shop at No. 256 West Avenue in this city, was 24 years old. He previously served as a squad leader in the 3rd District Security Corps of this city. He was imprisoned after being falsely accused of being an accomplice in a theft by the thief, Zhang Ashi. Later, after a second trial by the court, he was released on bail of 500 yuan. Because the court scheduled another summons for the 7th of this month, Baokang, overwhelmed with shame and indignation, took advantage of the Xinjiang Tianlun wheel departing from Ningbo the other day. At about 1:00 AM that night, when the ship reached the Tongsha ocean area, he pretended to go to the restroom and committed suicide by jumping into the sea. A suicide note addressed to his father was left on the ship. Upon hearing the news, his family members wept bitterly.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Special Report: Impressions of Economic Survey in Guangxi Province (Continued) <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>We spent a total of fifteen days surveying in Guilin before departing for Pingle. Pingle is located at the confluence of the Gui River and the Le River. Goods coming from Wuzhou often arrive in Pingle first and then go to Guilin, so commerce is quite developed. Among the agricultural products here, hemp is particularly noteworthy. The simplest use of hemp is for twisting ropes and threads. A more advanced use is for weaving hemp cloth or making imitation wool. It is said that growing hemp requires little labor and fertilizer. After the hemp roots are planted, only some pig and cow manure is needed. There can be three or four harvests a year, and it does not require fertile land. The hemp harvest is usually around April or May (as the saying goes, "Good hemp doesn't last past April 8th"). This is precisely the time when farming families are between harvests, so it plays a significant role in regulating rural finance. One of the main reasons why usury is less prevalent in Pingle is hemp cultivation. Its benefits are so great that credit cooperatives cannot hope to match them.</p>
<p>Lipu, a neighboring county of Pingle, is known for its taro production. Lipu taro and Tiansha pomelo are both famous products of Guangxi Province. This kind of taro is as large as a round pillow, with each tuber weighing about five or six catties. Having grown accustomed to the small taros of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, we were amazed by these large taros. After staying in Pingle for three days, we set off for Babu. Babu is a town in He County, about thirty miles from the county seat, but the essence of He County's commerce is entirely concentrated in Babu. Even the Guangxi Bank Guilin Exchange Office has an office stationed there. We arrived during the Double Tenth Festival. It is said that the reasons for the decline of commerce in Babu are threefold: first, Cantonese salt cannot be sold to Hunan; second, unified donations are heavy and harsh; and third, the former County Magistrate Huang forcibly changed the market days to the Gregorian calendar. This reason is extremely ridiculous. Originally, the industries in Guangxi were still in the "market" system. They have a market every three days, which the Guangxi people call "xu". These market days are not uniform everywhere. Some are set on the 3rd, 6th, and 9th (held on the 3rd, 6th, and 9th days of the month), while others are set on the 2nd, 5th, and 8th. Often within a county, there are several major market towns, their distances being thirty or fifty miles, or sixty or seventy miles, and their dates being interconnected. On market days, all the farmers, peddlers, small industrialists, and small merchants...all gather together. Although it is not "exchanging what they have for what they need," it is truly "trading what they have for what is lacking and retiring after the transaction." On the day of the market, the entire village is often emptied. As for the traveling merchants, their lives are entirely based on going to the market. Today they go to this market, tomorrow they go to that market, and the day after tomorrow they go to another market. The "xu" is their only place to find customers, and folk customs are the center of their lives. He County is no exception, with several markets and market days, but since the former County Magistrate Huang took office, he issued a notice to change the market days to the Gregorian calendar. However, although the markets here used the Gregorian calendar, the markets in neighboring counties still used the lunar calendar. As a result, this market day conflicted with that market day. Farmers and peddlers could go to this market but not that market. Since the system of circulating markets was broken, farmers and merchants had no choice but to stop going to this Gregorian calendar market altogether. The commerce of Babu was also greatly affected by the change of market days. This passage proves that the promotion of new cultural systems, without overall planning and consideration, will inevitably repeat the mistakes of County Magistrate Huang.</p>
<p>The goods exported from Babu pass through the He River to Duch City. Duch City is a town in Guangdong, located downstream of Wuzhou and upstream of Sanshui. Goods produced in the He River often arrive in Duch City first and then are shipped upstream to Wuzhou or downstream to the provinces and Hong Kong. Economically, He County has an unusually close relationship with Guangdong, so the commercial and financial power of He County and Babu is entirely in the hands of Guangdong people. What is even more indicative is that the merchants and people here only use Dong Hao (minted in Guangdong) and Xi Hao (minted in Guangxi) are not welcome. Speaking of Guangxi's currency, this is also very interesting. Originally, both Guangdong and Guangxi used Hao Yang (small silver dollars) as the standard. Hao Yang is what we commonly see in the south with two horns, five of which are worth one silver dollar. The so-called "silver dollar" has become a virtual standard currency. Hao Yang has the status of legal tender in Guangdong and Guangxi. For example, if we want to borrow a thousand dollars from someone, if we want cash, they will give you five thousand double Hao. Otherwise, you can ask for exchange coupons issued by the provincial bank. If you must have Yuan Tou Yang or Sun Yang, you have to go to the market to buy them. The market price of Hao Yang compared to Da Yang is usually an extra thirty cents, or sometimes forty or fifty cents. There are two types of Hao circulating in Guangxi: one is Dong Hao, which is commonly used in Guangdong Province, used from 1912 to 1924; the other is Xi Hao, which is minted by Guangxi Province itself, also known as Jiahe Hao, only in 1926 and 1927. In addition, there is also a Zhongshan Yang, minted in 1929. However, it is extremely troublesome to use Hao in Guangxi. Merchants and people are too picky, and farmers often suffer losses. For example, Dong Hao is only commonly used from 1912 to 1920. They would rather carry hundreds or thousands of cumbersome copper coins than carry light and easy silver Hao or banknotes. Even the copper coins are made according to their own systems and are not unified. In some places, large copper coins (worth twenty) and small copper coins (worth ten) are used together and regarded as the same unit (one large copper coin equals one small copper coin), such as in Yongning. In other places, only large copper coins are used, and small copper coins are only used as a unit of calculation (one large copper coin is worth twenty copper coins). This is governed by Gresham's Law of "bad money driving out good money," and small copper coins have disappeared as a result, such as in Guilin. In other places, large copper coins are not used at all, such as in Wuzhou. However, there are even places where the price of small copper coins is higher than that of large copper coins, requiring three large copper coins to exchange for two small copper coins, such as in Beiliu. This is because large copper coins are not very common, so the price is lower. Copper coins are like this, not to mention Hao. What is commonly used in one place may not be used in another place. What is welcomed in one place may be rejected in another place. Generally speaking, the fineness of Xi Hao is better than that of Dong Hao. Because Xi Hao only existed in 1926 and 1927, there is very little private minting and counterfeiting, so it is especially welcomed by the people of Guangxi. But Babu is a special exception. Babu merchants are much more lenient in their pickiness about Hao than in other places in Guangxi. Almost any Hao (referring to Dong Hao) can be used, but they just don't want to use Xi Hao. It is said that this is caused by two conditions: first, the financial power of Babu is entirely controlled by Guangdong people; second, the power of Guangxi Bank has never reached this place before, and Xi Hao is issued by Guangxi Bank.</p>
<p>Guangxi's currency system is considered to be a relatively unified province. Exchange coupons issued by the Guangxi Provincial Bank can be used everywhere except in extremely remote villages. Although Hao and copper coins have their different usage habits in various places, there is no bad phenomenon of "each doing its own thing." There are only two situations that we consider to be the most worrying: The first is that farmers in the countryside of Guangxi still use copper coins as the standard. Because they have suffered two major lessons in the past (the Guangxi Bank banknotes were suspended once when Lu Rongting was in power in 1921, and again when Huang Shaoxiong was in power in 1929), they are wary of banknotes issued by the Guangxi Provincial Bank. Using Hao, and because merchants and shops are too picky, taking the opportunity to profit, so the result is that they would rather use cumbersome copper coins as the standard for all transactions, and the impact of the depreciation of copper coins has already caused them to suffer great losses invisibly. The second is that in Guangxi's neighboring counties bordering Annam, transactions are based on French Guang, and the national currency has regressed to a secondary currency status. French Guang is the currency commonly used in Annam. This kind of French Guang has great power in the border areas of Annam. Local residents have a twelve-point belief in French Guang, and Guangxi's currency must be discounted before it can be used. Although the Guangxi Provincial Government has repeatedly issued prohibitions, its latent power seems to be something that cannot be eradicated by a single order.</p>

<p>A Central News Agency report stated that recent rumors suggested that Japan's actions in Xiamen might conflict with the interests of other powers, leading them to shift their focus to Sandu'ao in eastern Fujian, attempting to borrow the area from China as a naval base and training ground for the Japanese air force. Furthermore, it was rumored that Li Zeyi had visited the area to investigate and negotiate on this matter. However, according to a telegram received by the local authorities from the Fujian Provincial Government, the rumors of Japanese actions in Fujian are unfounded, and the forced borrowing of Sandu'ao is not true and is practically impossible.

<p>The Shanghai Local Association telegraphed the Central Government yesterday, stating: "To Chairman Lin of the Nanjing National Government, Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan, and Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance: It is reported that the Executive Yuan meeting passed the proposal of the Minister of Finance, requesting a clear order from the National Government to all regions, prohibiting any further increase in land tax surcharges and the establishment of illegal taxes. It also passed the proposal of the Minister of Finance, setting a deadline for the separate establishment of local donation and tax reorganization committees and donation and tax supervision committees to abolish harsh taxes as soon as possible. The people have long suffered in dire straits. Hearing this good news, they hope for relief. We hope that a clear order will be issued soon to benefit the people. In short, whether the people's lives, which are on the verge of death, can be revived, and whether the bankrupt rural areas can be rescued, will all depend on whether this measure is carried out effectively. The government has already shown its wisdom in understanding the situation in advance and will surely strictly implement it afterward. If this policy is adhered to, and all such grievances are addressed and innovations are made, it will not only be the good fortune of the people but also the blessing of the nation. We sincerely look forward to the implementation. Shanghai Local Association, Qi."</p>

<h3 id="e134">Guangdong Increases Agricultural Product Tax, Large Quantities of Grains Shipped to Guangdong, Three Cents Collected per Dan, Tax Collection Starts June 15th <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the Guangdong authorities have increased the agricultural product tax, causing Cantonese merchants in Shanghai, Qingdao, and other ports to rush to load large quantities of grain to Guangdong. Within this week, 300,000 dan of various grains will be shipped. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Collection of Agricultural Product Tax: To regulate the province's finances, the Guangdong authorities have decided to increase the tax on imported grains, called the Agricultural Product Tax. Calculated per dan, regardless of soybeans, rice, or wheat, all agricultural products must be taxed. It has been determined that the import tax will be three cents of silver per dan, starting on June 15th as the first day of collection. Each ton will be taxed approximately five yuan. The Guangdong authorities have announced this and notified all grain merchants.</p>
<p>Rushing to Transport Grains: The Guangdong grain merchants received a telegram from Guangdong stating that the tax is inevitable and will be collected soon. After this, the cost of grains arriving in Guangdong will increase significantly. They instructed various merchants in Shanghai to quickly transport agricultural products such as soybeans, peanuts, white rice, and wheat that have already been purchased to Guangdong before June 14th to avoid paying this new tax. The Shanghai Cantonese merchants estimated that at least 300,000 dan of grains from Shanghai, Qingdao, Hankou, and Haizhou can be rushed over. They have been in contact with various shipping companies to arrange for ships in advance to load the determined agricultural products and arrive in Guangdong one day before the new tax is implemented. Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, China Merchants, etc., have all agreed to dispatch ships to rush to load in Shanghai, Qingdao, and other ports.</p>
<p>Sanbei Adds New Regular Route: The Nanhua route of the Sanbei Company originally did not have regular commercial ships, only temporarily operating once or twice a year. This year, it plans to add a South China route, with the large ships Taishan and Longshan operating as regular ships, to the ports of Shantou, Guangdong, and other places, and set up wharf warehouses. Recently, due to the Guangdong's increased agricultural product tax, the grain merchants requested the dispatch of ships to transport goods. The Sanbei Company took the opportunity to advance the opening of the South China route. Yesterday, the Taishan ship was dispatched for the first time as a regular ship, carrying passengers and loading agricultural grains, about 16,000 to 17,000 dan to Guangdong.</p>

<p>According to a Central News Agency report, the International Trade Bureau released an overview of Sino-Japanese trade in April yesterday, which is recorded as follows: In April of this year, the total value of Japanese exports to China was 11,554,046 yuan, including 385,988 yuan from Taiwan, a decrease of 1,913,734 yuan compared to the same month last year, and an increase of 805,857 yuan compared to March of this year. In addition, the total of 35,000 thousand yuan in April is still far from the 114,106 thousand yuan of the total exports to China from the United States in four months. It is obvious that Sino-Japanese trade has not reached a good level.</p>
<p>Goods Imported to China: In April, cotton cloth was still the most imported commodity from Japan to China, valued at 782,820 gold units, equivalent to 1,546,852 national currency yuan. Among cotton cloths, undyed cotton cloth was the most abundant, reaching more than 372,000 yuan. Coarse cloth, fine cloth, and bamboo cloth were also considerable, totaling more than 339,000 yuan. Other dyed yarns and foreign yarns also reached more than 254,700 yuan. Items such as foreign standard cloth and fine twill cloth were also not small, each reaching tens of thousands of yuan. The number of fish and shellfish was also not small, with a total value of 429,015 yuan. Rubber products had 413,193 yuan. Other items such as rayon and cement each had hundreds of thousands of yuan. However, rice and flour increased very little, each around tens of thousands of yuan.</p>
<p>Export Goods: In April, food and flour were the largest exported commodities, valued at 663,455 yuan. Cotton was also considerable, valued at 637,771 yuan. The item of cotton yarn more than doubled compared to the previous month, reaching 448,349 yuan. Other items such as coal and ore each reached more than 300,000 yuan. Bones and meats were also more than 200,000 yuan. However, due to the robbery in the Northeast, the number of beans was still not worth mentioning, only more than 79,000 yuan. In addition, there were no major differences. The total export value in April was 6,165,610 yuan, an increase of 1,501,118 yuan compared to the previous month, which can be said to be a good situation. Total Trade Deficit: In trade with Japan this month, the total trade deficit was 5,388,436 yuan, a decrease of 700,000 yuan compared to the previous month, and it is still a major country with a trade deficit. As for gold and silver, there were absolutely no imports. Exports, including silver coins and raw silver, were only worth 100 yuan, an extremely small amount. As for merchant ships, 193 Japanese ships imported, totaling 358,68 tons. 188 ships exported, weighing 341,242 tons.</p>
<h3 id="e136">China's Egg Exports Decline Year After Year; Egg Merchants Request Negotiations with Various Countries to Increase Egg Taxes <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>According to a Central News Agency report, in addition to silk and tea, eggs are also among the top seven exports for China's foreign trade, but in recent years, they have been declining. The period from 1928 to 1930 was the golden age of egg exports, and egg merchants had considerable profits. Subsequently, it gradually declined and is even worse now. The reasons are: first, the egg production of various countries has increased, resulting in price dumping; second, countries that need eggs have increased tariffs and restricted the import of Chinese eggs. A comparison of egg exports since 1930 is as follows: The total export value in 1930 was 79,710,940 yuan; in 1931, it was 58,827,838 yuan; in 1932, it was 44,302,413 yuan; and in 1933, it was 36,489,477 yuan. This year is even worse than last year. The declining situation can be seen from the export comparison over the past four years. At present, egg merchants are appealing to the Ministry of Finance to exempt egg exports from export tax and are requesting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with countries that have increased egg tariffs to remedy the situation.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Three Major Principles of the Anti-Drug Association for Prohibition of Opium Presented to the Government Yesterday <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association held a commemorative meeting on June 3rd for opium prohibition and requested the government to earnestly prohibit opium. After it was reported in various newspapers, it is learned that the association has telegraphed the government and proposed three major principles for opium prohibition. The original telegram is transcribed as follows: "To Chairman Lin of the Nanjing National Government, President Wang of the Executive Yuan, Chairman Chiang of Nanchang, and Deputy Commander Zhang of Wuchang, esteemed sirs, the harm of opium to the country has lasted for a century, causing internal and external troubles, leading to the shaking and decline of the national foundation and people's livelihood. The late Premier's instructions and the Kuomintang's program both advocated strict prohibition without a doubt. Judging from the current situation, the only way out for our country is to resist Japan to save the nation and to prohibit opium to survive. Opium prohibition is a prerequisite for resisting Japan. With the current slump in national morale and the decline of national strength, the whole country is in a state of darkness and unable to extricate itself. How can we talk about resisting Japan and seeking self-strengthening? Furthermore, opium is the vanguard of aggression and a tool for extermination. The Japanese warlords are intent on invading our country and first send vagrants to spread poison everywhere. After occupying the three northeastern provinces, they immediately rushed to implement the opium monopoly. Colonial governments in various parts of Southeast Asia also use opium to control overseas Chinese and hasten their demise. The sinister plan is obvious to everyone. The current situation in our mainland is probably even worse than in the Northeast and Southeast Asia. At the recent International Opium Conference, the American representative strongly condemned our country for producing opium everywhere, with a total amount exceeding seven times the world's total, which will inevitably poison the whole world. The words may be excessive, but it is undeniable that our country's opium poppy seedlings have not been cleared. Even if the central government is determined to prohibit opium, the various institutions established by warlords in the inland provinces mostly regard this as a source of profit. The opium power is developing rapidly. To talk about prohibition is almost empty talk. Therefore, the proposition of collecting tax on opium prohibition and the proposal of open sale are rampant. Some use scientific opium prohibition as a slogan, and some advocate turning private into public to move people. However, these methods have been implemented repeatedly. The result is limited income and endless outflow of currency. There is tax collection, but no prohibition. It only makes the opium disaster spread more and more, creating opportunities for unscrupulous people to make money, which does not contribute much to the national treasury. The impact is that the country's reputation is falling, and foreigners are constantly criticizing. Internally, scholars are becoming increasingly corrupt, and ordinary people are suffering from hunger. Public opinion is rising, and people's hearts are disturbed. Those who rely on this to open up financial resources will suffer more than they gain. I believe this has long been observed by your esteemed selves. Our association has been engaged in anti-drug activities for ten years, running and shouting without daring to slack off. Although the environment is bad, we still adhere to our consistent stance and continue to fight without daring to slacken. Recently, Chairman Chiang accepted the suggestions of the general secretary of our association and closed the opium dens in Wuhan. Then, he issued an order to strictly prohibit potent drugs. The news spread, and the masses were overjoyed. However, the accumulated poison in the country has penetrated deep into the people. It seems that a fundamental solution to the prohibition should be carefully planned, and a long-term detoxification campaign should be promoted. My colleagues are willing to contribute their years of research results and the knowledge gained from domestic and foreign investigations and studies. Here are the following suggestions for your selection: (1) The government should hire several Chinese and foreign experts to form an Opium Prohibition Design Committee and invite representatives from countries that have no special interests in opium to participate. These experts should be qualified with a thorough understanding of opium agriculture and economic issues. Start with investigation and research opium prohibition methods that meet the needs of the facts based on the investigation facts. The government should provide various conveniences and protections for the investigation and designate personnel to carry out the planned program. The total amount of opium tax collected by the central and local government troops should be calculated. The committee should study other sources to compensate. It is said that the new tariff sources should not affect the people's livelihood and disturb social stability. (2) In handling opium prohibition, no matter which method is adopted, the principle of pure prohibition should be adopted. The government should express its determination to carry it out strictly, starting with the military and political personnel to restore the public's faith. For opium prohibition administration, the government should select high-ranking and pure individuals who have the strength and determination to prohibit opium and are trusted by the people to take charge of the opium prohibition, and should give them practical guarantees and necessary privileges to make it easier to achieve results. Otherwise, the person in charge may use opium prohibition to make profits and promote their personal goals. The fines for opium prohibition and all opium revenue must be avoided for military and political expenses and should be allocated to handle smoking cessation and anti-drug education funds. As for the vast territory of the country, it is not easy to prohibit it in one day. It seems appropriate to designate several provinces to take the lead to set an example for other provinces and show the determination to implement it. (3) In handling opium prohibition, the government should cooperate with the people's anti-drug movement to promote the movement, such as surveying opium poppy fields, arresting smugglers, prohibiting private sales, and cracking down on smoking, to seek thoroughness and effectiveness. These responsibilities can be undertaken by the anti-drug organizations in each county and the local public organizations to select fair people to form an opium prohibition supervision committee. In order to promote opium prohibition, the government should convene a national opium prohibition conference on a regular basis to gather the opinions of officials and the people to promote cooperation between the two parties. Here are three outlines compiled based on the results of the Shanghai June 3rd Opium Prohibition Commemorative Meeting. I sincerely request that you implement them to save the crisis. Opium prohibition is fortunate, our country is fortunate. President of the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association, Wang Jingqi, General Secretary Huang Jiahui, and all committee members kowtow together."</p>
<h3 id="e139">Gu Xin-yi Returns to Shanghai from Beijing <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the depression in the flour industry in this city has made flour manufacturers feel uneasy. The Ministry of Industry, in order to save the situation, sent Liang Shangdong, a section chief of the ministry, to Shanghai to conduct on-the-spot investigations. After Liang returned to Beijing, he reported the findings of the investigation to the ministry. The ministry still needs to consult on how to determine relief measures, so it telegraphed Gu Xin-yi, a prominent figure in the flour industry in this city, to go to Beijing. Mr. Gu went to Beijing the day before yesterday and stayed for about three days before returning to Shanghai yesterday. It is reported that the results of Mr. Gu's trip were satisfactory.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Recent News on Negotiations for Road Construction Beyond the Border. The Municipal Government Quietly Awaits the Central Government's Attitude. <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>According to the China Eastern News Agency, negotiations on road construction beyond the border have been stalled for several months. Yesterday, it was suddenly reported that as a result of repeated negotiations between Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, and Feixin-dun, Director-General of the Public Works Bureau, a considerable solution has been reached. It is also said that the content of the resolution is to establish a police chief, who will be Chinese, and a deputy police chief, who will be British. Two assistant deputy police chiefs will be appointed, one each from Chinese and Japanese personnel. Negotiations on public works matters have been slightly delayed because Shen Yi, Director of the Public Works Bureau, has taken leave and gone abroad. The boundary issue is roughly set at 7,923 acres. Yesterday, Guo Shen, Secretary of the Municipal Government, told reporters from the China Eastern News Agency that this news is very unreliable. Negotiations on road construction beyond the border have been stalled for six months, and there is no progress in reopening negotiations. So, where did the talk of a solution come from? The Municipal Government is handling this matter in the capacity of a local authority and is negotiating with the Public Works Bureau. Since a satisfactory solution is difficult to expect, it should be decided after considering the attitude of the Central Government on this matter.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Lin Kanghou Hopes Banks Will Circulate the Rural Economy. The Current Investment of Millions is Too Small. <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>A reporter from the Ta Kung Pao met with Lin Kanghou at the Bankers' Association yesterday to discuss the recent situation of banks in this city investing in rural areas. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e142">Collapsed State of the Rural Economy <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>According to Lin, since the founding of the Republic of China, domestic natural disasters and man-made disasters have not stopped, resulting in the decline of rural areas and the decline of the economy. Ordinary wealthy households cannot withstand the harassment and have flocked to Shanghai to take refuge. As a result, the rural areas have become even more unbearable, and Shanghai has become increasingly prosperous. This kind of abnormal development is worrying about the future. Money is like blood. Shanghai is like the brain, and the inland is like the limbs. If the blood of the limbs all enters the brain, the limbs will become stiff. And in the brain, there will be cerebral hemorrhage due to too much blood. If the above situation is not remedied, the future of the country is in danger.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Recent Situation of Bank Investment in the Inland <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>At present, the banks in this city have become slightly aware of this, so some bank managers have turned their attention to investing in rural areas in an attempt to restore the rural economy. The recent investment situation includes the investment in Northwest construction. The Southwest is also sending people to negotiate, and it is expected to be agreed soon. The negotiations in Sichuan have been settled. Branches have now been established all over the inland of Jiangsu to facilitate farmers' loans. Jiangbei Xuzhou and other places have now been covered. In Jiangxi, there is the government-run Four Provinces Farmers Bank to regulate the finances of the four provinces. The Xinjiang and Tibet regions will be dealt with in the second term.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Lin's Opinion on Investment <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Lin continued, "I very much agree with the bank's investment in the inland rural areas to restore the rural economy. The brain should also send blood to the limbs so that they can move. At the same time, we should know that the country is based on the people. If the people are poor and no measures are taken to remedy it, it is tantamount to the limbs dying while the brain lives alone. What is the value of living? Therefore, taking this opportunity to invest in the inland rural economy is the basis for a rich country and a strong people. However, the current investment of the banks in the inland is only several million yuan, which is too small. I hope that the banks will enthusiastically invest in the inland."</p>

<h3 id="e145">American Lawyer Ifferley Will Arrive in Shanghai, Saying the United States Will Amend Immigration Laws <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>According to the Great American Evening News, Chicago-based lawyer Ifferley, known for his strong opposition to American laws excluding Eastern immigrants, arrived in Shanghai by the Nagasaki Maru on Thursday with his wife and daughter from Xijing. It is said that American public opinion is gradually opposing this law, and Congress has submitted six amendments. One or two of them may be passed during this session, and granting special power to certain groups to handle individual cases of Chinese and Japanese people is also possible. If so, immigrants will no longer be expelled unfairly. Immigration quotas may be set for Chinese and Japanese immigrants. This is Ifferley's third trip to the East. He plans to take the train north today to visit the old capital.</p>
<h3 id="e146">The Amount of Spring Cocoons from Zhejiang is Decreasing Year by Year. <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>This year's Zhejiang spring cocoons transported by the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway have been contracted by the Huitong Transportation Company. Transportation began on May 16, with successive reports of loading from various stations to Shanghai. The cocoons are unloaded at both the North and South roads. As of yesterday, the South Station had received more than 7,700 packages of spring cocoons, and the North Station had unloaded more than 3,000 packages, for a total of more than 10,000 packages. According to the contractor, the number of cocoons transported has been decreasing year by year. This year is the last for spring cocoons to be transported by rail. It is estimated that there will be more than 30,000 packages. In previous years, there were 150,000 to 160,000 packages at the end of the season. Since last year, it has decreased to 50,000 packages. This year, it has decreased to more than 30,000 packages. There are two main reasons for this: (1) due to market conditions, farmers have reduced raising silkworms; (2) railway freight rates are more expensive, so cocoon merchants have switched to water transportation.</p>

The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus have received a telegram from the Ministry of Railways, preparing freight cars to travel to Beijing on that day to transport the exhibits back to Shanghai. The exhibition office has also scheduled to invite people from all walks of life in Shanghai on the 17th, with the Ministry of Railways designating a first-class car attached to the Shanghai-Beijing train for transportation. However, since the first-class car only has 16 seats, only the leaders of various industries related to railway transportation have been invited to participate. The previous proposal to invite reporters from various newspapers to visit has been cancelled.</p>

<h3 id="e150">The Review Committee for Books and Magazines of the Central Propaganda Committee Has Officially Started Working. The Address is No. 7 Shanghai Villa, Huanlong Road. <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Central Propaganda Committee believes that among the books and magazines published by bookstores, many have pure ideas, but there are also some that contain other functions and are enough to lure young people and society. In the past, party and government organs had to give separate restrictions on such books and periodicals containing functions, but bookstores and writers inevitably suffered losses after publication. Now, in order to carefully restrict publications, a Book and Magazine Review Committee has been organized to review the original manuscripts of literary, artistic, and social science books and periodicals, so as to avoid losses to bookstores and writers after publication. The committee has now been prepared internally and has selected No. 7 Shanghai Villa, Huanlong Road, French Concession, as the address, and officially started working on the 6th of this month. It is reported that the committee has telegraphed the Central Propaganda Committee, informing the Book Industry Association of this city to inform all bookstores to send the original manuscripts of literary, artistic, and social science books and periodicals to the committee for review in accordance with the Book and Magazine Review Measures. The Book and Magazine Review Measures of the committee are recorded as follows: Article 1. These measures are formulated in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 of the Organizational Regulations of the Book and Magazine Review Committee of the Central Propaganda Committee. Article 2. All books and magazines published by bookstores, societies, or authors within the territory of the Republic of China shall, before printing, submit the original manuscript to the Book and Magazine Review Committee of the Central Propaganda Committee (hereinafter referred to as the committee) for review in accordance with these measures. The aforementioned review matters shall be conducted on a trial basis in Shanghai first in accordance with the resolution of the 115th Standing Committee Meeting of the Central Executive Committee. Article 3. When submitting the original manuscript of a book or magazine for review, the applicant shall provide the following items: A. Name of the book or periodical; B. Name and address of the applicant; C. Name and address of the editor; D. Length and number of words. Article 4. All books and magazines submitted for review shall be given convenient and swift review by the committee. Article 5. If the content of the original manuscript of a book or magazine submitted for review is deemed inappropriate, it may be returned to the original applicant with an order to delete and modify it in accordance with the review opinions. If the entire text violates the provisions of Article 3 of the Standards for Reviewing Propaganda, and violates the restrictions of Article 19 of Chapter 4 of the Publication Law, the committee may submit the original document to the Central Propaganda Committee for verification. Article 6. The committee shall issue a review certificate to the manuscript of a book or magazine that has been reviewed and approved by the committee. Article 7. When publishing the manuscript of a book or magazine that has obtained a review certificate, the review certificate number shall be printed on the cover page to identify it. Article 8.

<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance again yesterday, saying: "To the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, esteemed sirs, the case of the previous submission from the Chamber regarding the illegal collection of fresh fruit taxes in Tianjin City was approved by your ministry on the 7th of this month in Document No. 1623, which stated, 'Received the submission and informed the Qinghebei Provincial Government to investigate and handle the matter promptly.' This Chamber respectfully investigated that the layer of confiscated goods being auctioned is already beyond the point of no return. Those that have been confiscated but not auctioned have also had the fruit and goods industry in Shanghai recommend a representative to agree with the contractor on a temporary bookkeeping method of paying a deposit. These are not the main points of the case. What this Chamber previously submitted a request for was whether the tax should be levied on the goods according to the tax regulations, and whether the vendors should be regarded as brokers and forced to pay the brokerage tax. These are all legal issues, not factual issues. Your ministry is responsible for the national tax administration and should have the power to interpret and decide, without the need for local officials to repeatedly investigate. Whether the brokerage tax deposit can be returned has been stipulated to be decided by the interpretation of your ministry. This is the most important key to this case. It is also noted that the proposals for sorting out local finances submitted by your ministry at the National Financial Conference involve six items related to the brokerage tax: (1) Brokers are not allowed to set up checkpoints in trading markets or block roads to collect commissions. (2) Direct buying and selling of goods and passengers are not allowed to be forced to join the industry. (6) Disguised collection of goods donations is not allowed. The Tianjin fresh fruit brokerage tax is exactly this kind of malpractice. The previous submission from this Chamber has detailed it. We request that your ministry verify the previous submission and correct it in accordance with this decree. The dispute in this case can be resolved. Otherwise, if local officials entrust it to the municipal government, and the municipal government entrusts it to the finance bureau, and they repeatedly submit reports, they will inevitably protect their situation that has been established for more than ten years, or even use the fact that the confiscated goods have been returned as a pretext to avoid the serious and take the light. Businessmen are still in trouble, and there is no fundamental solution, and it does not help the matter. This Chamber is obligated to buy its stupidity again. We beg you to review and instruct us to comply. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce kowtows."</p>

At a time when the theory of scientific Chinese medicine in the country is very noisy, the Academia Sinica can first realize the academic contributions recognized by both the new and old medical circles.</p>

<p>The Japanese-Qing Steamship Company is doing its best to operate the upstream and downstream lines of the Yangtze River. At its peak, a total of 21 ships were operating. Since the outbreak of the Northeast and Shanghai wars, it has been affected by boycotts, and almost all ships have stopped sailing. The Japanese design to restore it was ineffective. In order to maintain the route, they reluctantly operated the four ships Fengyang, Xiangyang, Nanyang, and Luoyang between Shanghai and Hankou. Now, because the heat of the boycott of Japanese goods in the provinces along the Yangtze River has gradually decreased, and the opportunity to dump goods has come again, the Xinyang Maru has been sent to resume sailing between Shanghai and Yichang, the Dangyang Maru has been sent to sail between Hankou and Yichang, and yesterday, the Yunyang Maru was sent to sail between Shanghai and Yichang. It will sail from Shanghai for the first time today, mainly carrying Japanese goods.</p>

<p>Zhang Shou-yong, the former Vice Minister of Finance and a native of Ningbo, is a lover of ancient books and has the reputation of being a "bookworm." His residence, Yueyuan, has a rich collection of books, especially focusing on local literature. He is diligent in collecting, without distinction between cold and summer. In recent years, he has edited the Siming Series, which has been printed in four collections of A, B, C, and D. In addition, he learned that the predecessors in various counties of Ningbo, from the Han to the Qing dynasties, have been authors. The Siku Quanshu recorded in the former Qing Dynasty only recorded more than 200 species, and those that were not recorded were more than double that. He planned to compile a list of books owned by each collector, examine their versions, discuss their origins, and compile a summary of Siming books in the style of the Siku Quanshu Summary. He has joined forces with more than a dozen like-minded people, including Ye Zhuotang, Fang Shiru, Zhou Zhenqin, and Wang Boyuan, to jointly initiate and raise funds of several thousand yuan to use the original library room on the third floor of the Ningbo Compatriot Association as the address of the society. He has hired Xia Qiyu, a senior compatriot, as the editor-in-chief, and Zhang and Xin Jiangming will assist him at any time. It is reported that they officially started editing on the 1st of this month, with the goal of completing the book in three years. In the future, the younger generation of Siming will be able to learn from this book as if they were personally taught by their predecessors, benefiting the students to come. This is of great help to local literature, and this move by the people of Ningbo is enough to be a model for general teachers.</p>

<p>According to the Da Gong She (L'Impartial), the Bean and Rice Trade Association held a meeting of the executive committee at Cuixiu Hall at 3:00 PM on the 8th. Items discussed: (1) Tang Maoxian, who opened the Xiangxing Rice Store, used bad checks to swindle more than 1,000 bags of rice from his colleagues. He has been sentenced to six months in prison, with a separate private prosecution. (2) Recently, it was reported in the newspapers that a rice industry bank was being organized, with Zhu Zixiang, an executive committee member of this association, listed as a member. Our colleagues should ask Zhu for a report on whether or not this is happening. Then, the following motions were discussed: One, new colleagues requested to join the membership, and the motion was passed. Two, the Chinese Red Cross sought members. It was resolved that executive and supervisory committee members, except those already introduced by the Miscellaneous Grain Association, should join as ordinary members.

<h3 id="e163">Gang Workers Gather to Cause Trouble in Longhua Town <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The fuel used by the Shitai Silk Factory in Caohe Temple, west of Longhua Town, Shanghai, was contracted by the Shanghai Rongchang Coal Company to hire boats to transport it to the Jiangkou in front of the factory for unloading. The workers in charge of transportation were all managed by Hu Yuede, a Siyang native, who was assigned by the contractor Tang Renzhi. Recently, due to disagreements, the work was taken over by Lu Youren, a Taizhou native, who was assigned by You Renzhi. As a result, Hu and Lu harbored personal grudges and competed during work. At about 11:00 AM yesterday, several more coal boats arrived. Lu Youren feared that Hu would come to compete, so he reported to the local branch station and the Caojing District Security Corps, and each sent police officers to the scene to suppress them. At that time, Hu Yuede's side already had more than 20 workers, each holding a pole to compete for transportation. The Security Corps took Zhang Defa, Chen Rushan, and Li Shanzhang, the three ringleaders, back to the team and confiscated an ax. While they were being interrogated, Hu Yuede gathered more than 60 hooligans and surrounded and attacked Shen Miaochun, the platoon leader of the Security Corps who was suppressing them in front of the Baotai Silk Factory, and the team members Hu Youcai and Wu Fusheng, with a fierce momentum. Platoon Leader Shen had no choice but to draw his pistol and fire several shots into the air, while leading the team members to escape the siege. However, the workers followed and chased them to the front of the team headquarters. With an order, they rushed in and released Zhang Defa and the other three. The order was chaotic at that time. Wu Rugui, the captain of the team, ordered the team members to retreat temporarily in order to avoid misunderstandings. He reported to Liu Songjian, a patrol officer at the town's branch station, and Tang Chunrong, a police chief, who led the police to the scene to disperse them and take Hu Yuede and Song Dongnan, the two ringleaders, to the station.</p>
<p>Wu Zhengding, the director of the station, briefly questioned them. According to Hu Yuede's confession, he was 51 years old, from Siyang, and lived in the Beipiao Company. The work was contracted by the people to Tang Renzhi, and the pole strength was 80 cents per ton, but Tang only paid me 40 cents. So, since May 1st, I have agreed with Mao Chunpu, the manager of Rongchang Coal Company, to pay 50 cents per ton. However, Tang Renzhi now entrusted Lu Youren to transport the poles and did not allow me to work, instigated the Security Corps to open fire, causing the workers Song Dongnan and Qi Desheng to panic and escape, lost their footing and fell into the water. Now Song has been rescued, but Qi is still missing. He must have drowned. According to the worker Song Dongnan's confession, he was 28 years old, from Siyang, and his confession was roughly the same as Hu's. Director Wu believed that the workers gathered to cause trouble and dared to trap the Security Corps team headquarters. However, Qi Desheng had drowned. It should be investigated and verified before proceeding. Therefore, he prepared a document and sent it to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>Yang Chenglin, a resident of Nanhui, Pudong, is over sixty years old. He runs a straw shop at No. 53 Gaochangmiao Road, Nanshi. The business is doing well, and he can maintain his livelihood. Unexpectedly, at about 2:00 AM yesterday, he carelessly dropped sparks while cooking breakfast, causing flammable materials to ignite. In an instant, thick smoke filled the air and pierced the roof. When the nearby police officer saw it, he immediately notified the fire brigades of various districts and quickly dispatched fire trucks to rush to the scene. The firefighters worked hard to put out the fire, and the fire was extinguished in about half an hour. It is estimated that Yang Chenglin and his neighbors lost two flat houses and a lot of property. Then, Su Xin, a patrol officer at the Gaochangmiao Branch of the Second District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, led the police to the scene to maintain order and investigate the cause of the fire. The arsonist Yang Chenglin was taken to the Hu District for interrogation.</p>

<p>Feng Buzhou and Zhang Jinzheng rented two houses, Nos. 56 and 64 Yuyuanli, Xinjia Road, Zhabei, from the British Guangye Company.

Now Feng and others believe that the owed rent is a civil matter, so they filed a complaint with the local court accusing the director Bao Ju of illegal detention and depriving the people of their freedom. It is heard that the court ordered the plaintiff and defendant to appear in court for trial at 9:00 AM yesterday morning. The plaintiff's side, Feng Buzhou and Zhang Zhou, arrived, but the defendant did not. The judge, seeing that the defendant did not arrive, ordered that the hearing be postponed and the defendant be summoned to court for trial.</p>

<p>Ding Cui, a young woman from Anhui, was married to Ding Xiangsheng, a fellow villager, by a matchmaker named Feng on the 17th day of the first month of the 13th year of the Republic of China. After getting married in their hometown, the couple had a very strong relationship and had no children. Later, Ding came to Shanghai to work as a houseboy for a Westerner in Hongkou, and she also came to Shanghai with her husband. They lived at No. 36 Sanjiabang Road, Rue du Père Robert, in the French Concession. However, Ding did not engage in proper business and specialized in seeking pleasure. He also had an opium addiction and often went to a certain "swallow's nest" on the upper floor of the Songtao Teahouse in Wangjiabang to indulge. A woman surnamed Xu flirted with Ding, so Ding became disgusted with his wife, disliked her for her unattractive appearance, and therefore his attitude became increasingly cold. There were often quarrels at home, and recently it has become even worse, with him often beating her when he came home. Unable to bear the abuse, she developed a pessimistic view of life. The day before, she bought opium and went to a fortune-telling stall in Xieqiao, spent four jiao, and wrote a suicide note, which she hid in her bosom. The night before at 11:00 PM, she secretly went to the riverside of the Anhui Guild Hall in Nanshi and was about to swallow the opium to commit suicide when she was discovered by a passerby, who sent the woman, opium, and suicide note to the Second District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, which was then transferred to the Relief Section of the Second Division of the General Bureau for rescue.</p>

<p>At about 8:00 AM yesterday, a case of a young couple being shot and assassinated by thugs occurred in the pavilion room on the third floor of No. 64 Shanfuli, Lane 148 (i.e., Liujia Lane), Shanzhong Road, French Concession, behind the Gongshi Middle School (公時中學). Both died on the spot, and the perpetrators fled without a trace. The police heard the news and sent detectives to carry the two bodies to the mortuary for examination. The backgrounds of the two victims and the details of the murder are described below:</p>
<h3 id="e168">Young Couple <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Liu Youqing, a native of Zhenjiang, was 38 years old and worked in the engineering department of the Shanghai Telephone Company. Several years ago, he acquired a three-story shikumen house at No. 84 Shanfuli, Lane 148, Shanzhong Road, and became a second landlord. He lived in the living room downstairs, and the remaining rooms were rented out to others. About a month and a half ago, a young couple living in No. 60 in the same neighborhood moved into Liu's pavilion room on the third floor with a young girl. The rent was set at six yuan per month. After the two parties agreed, they moved in immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Evening Newspaper Translator <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>After this young couple moved in, they claimed that their names were Chen Fangruo, a native of Hubei, 28 years old, and the woman's name was Liu Jie, also a native of Hubei, 32 years old. The girl's name was Xiaolianzi, five years old. When asked where he worked, he said that he was a translator for the "大美晚報" (The Greater American Evening News). Liu saw that the couple were both literary and spoke very kindly, so he did not suspect anything else. After Chen moved in, the furnishings in the room were unusually simple, with only a half-bed, a writing desk, a rattan chair, four square stools, and a desk full of books, with nothing else of value.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Sudden Disaster <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>For three meals a day, the two cooked their own food. However, every day after 4:00 PM, Chen had to go out alone once, rain or shine, but the young woman never went out, and there were very few female visitors. Sometimes late at night, Chen still held a pen and wrote straight. The second landlord thought that Chen was in the newspaper industry and was probably writing at his desk, so he did not suspect anything else. Unexpectedly, at about 8:10 AM yesterday, Chen and his wife and daughter had all gotten up, and the girl was playing downstairs. Chen was sitting and reading the newspaper, and his wife was tidying up the bedclothes when the disaster suddenly struck.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Loquat Gift <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>At this moment, several thugs came to the back door of the house. Two people wearing black and white short clothes闯入 entered, while the rest remained outside. They pretended to be giving gifts. One person was carrying two bamboo baskets similar to loquats. When they entered the door, they asked where the Chen family lived. The second landlord replied that they lived in the pavilion room on the third floor. The two went straight upstairs. Not long after, more than a dozen gunshots were suddenly heard. At that time, the people downstairs initially suspected that the residents in the lane were setting off firecrackers, so they did not care.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Horrible Scene in the Room <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Not long after, the child Xiaolianzi went upstairs for breakfast. She only saw that her parents had been shot dead in the room. She was extremely frightened and ran downstairs to tell the second landlord and his family the news. They rushed upstairs, but saw Chen still sitting dangerously on the chair, and Chen's wife was lying diagonally on the bed. Blood was flowing on the floor. They rushed to report to the police. The police chief sent Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. It was found that Chen Fangruo had been shot three times, one in the back of the neck, one in the brain, and one in the left eye socket, piercing through the right ear. His wife, Liu Jie, had been shot five times, one in the left hand fork, two bullets in the lip area, and two in the back, piercing through the front abdomen.</p>
<h3 id="e173">A Large Number of Books <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>The detectives saw that both people had died, so they immediately notified the Tongrenfuyuantang to send undertakers to carry the two bodies to the mortuary for examination. The detectives continued to carefully search the room. All the books were New Culture and various pamphlets that had been banned by the government. Then, according to the second landlord's statement, the detectives rushed to the 美晚報 (The Greater American Evening News) to investigate. The newspaper replied that there was no such person. After further investigation, they learned that Wu Youmei, the editor of the Zhonghua Daily Monthly, was on good terms with Chen. The detectives went to No. 67 Siming Village, Fuxu Road, to visit Wu.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Words of a Friend <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>When the detectives questioned Wu, Wu admitted that he was indeed friends with Chen and said that Chen was a graduate of Sun Yat-sen University in Moscow, Russia. Wu knew Chen from his student days. Chen's current situation was extremely difficult, and he only relied on submitting articles to make a living. He had recently published an article in the Labor Monthly, titled "The Second International Problem After Hitler Took Office". An article in the Zhonghua Daily was "The Restoration of Relations Between the United States and Russia," etc. According to Chen, he originally lived at No. 3 Sanheli, Xiaoshadu Road, at Dr. Li Guanying's residence, and then moved to No. 60 Shanfuli. A month and a half ago, he moved to No. 64. Wu did not want to say much after hearing the news of Chen's murder.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Corpse Examination <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>After the case occurred, the French Concession authorities paid special attention to it and ordered its subordinates to conduct a thorough investigation in order to get to the bottom of the case in the shortest possible time. The orphaned girl Xiaolianzi was temporarily raised by friends. Yesterday afternoon, the chief prosecutor Chen Beisan, along with forensic doctor Wei Ligong and clerk Zhao Yifen, came to the mortuary to examine the bodies on behalf of the Procuratorate of the Second Special District Court. It was verified that Chen's body had been hit by three bullets in the head, one entering from the left eyebrow and exiting from the upper corner of the left ear, one entering from the back of the head, and one entering from the top of the back of the head, none of which exited. Liu's body was hit by five bullets, two bullets entering from the back, piercing through the front chest, two entering from the upper and lower sides behind the left ear, one exiting from the left corner of the mouth, two teeth were knocked out, and one bullet passed through the fork between the index and middle fingers of the left hand. After the examination, the case was brought up in court. According to the report of the detective Zhang Chunsheng, the investigation was carried out after the incident. According to the testimony of Chen Wenfu (63 years old), a Ningbo native who was in charge of the alley, he witnessed the perpetrators entering and exiting. The official ruled that since no relatives of the deceased had arrived, it was verified that Chen Fangruo and Liu Jie had died from gunshot wounds during their lifetime. The bodies were temporarily handed over to Tongrenfuyuantang for burial, waiting for relatives to claim them and waiting for the police to arrest the perpetrators and bring them to justice. It is heard that the police have dispatched detectives to investigate the perpetrators in various directions.</p>

<p>Creating a New Speed Record for Yachts to Japan: According to the Dalu Bao, the French yacht "迦白里爾 (Gablier) No. 2" of this port, 64 feet long and luxuriously decorated, set off for Japan on Sunday morning and arrived safely in Nagasaki at 10:30 AM yesterday, Thursday, creating a new speed record for yachts to Japan. This is two days faster than the German yacht "奇里登 (Chiridon)", which was 48 feet long at the time. The ship was piloted by French naval officer Biles and carried three French Municipal Council officials and two Chinese foremen. The yacht "丹那斯柯特 (Dunnscott)", which left Shanghai for Japan on the same day, piloted by the Danish Zhu Qinsheng, will probably take one or two more days to arrive in Nagasaki. However, this ship is the smallest yacht to ever go to Japan, only 27 feet long, so the speed is slower.</p>

After checking his body, several pieces of women's Western clothing materials and two dozen silk stockings were found hidden on his body. He was detained by the police station and taken to the Japanese Consulate. It is currently being investigated whether he has committed other crimes.</p>

The various electrical appliances produced by electrical appliance manufacturers in Shanghai are of excellent quality and are not inferior to imported products. The price is also cheaper than foreign goods, so they have recently been sold in large quantities in the domestic and European and American markets, and the various light bulbs produced, regardless of the size of the wattage or the height of the pounds, are available and complete, so they are especially praised by people in society and are happy to purchase them. We have always admired your school's promotion of domestic products and will not spare any effort. We have prepared a letter of introduction, and we hope that you will grant its adoption in order to prevent leakage and save rights.

<p>According to the Shenshi News Agency, in order to improve the national railway transportation equipment, the Ministry of Railways decided to prepare for cold storage transportation on various routes. The entire project is divided into three phases, and the budget requires approximately 1.5 million yuan. The first phase requires approximately 500,000 yuan, which has been discussed by the Ministry of Railways with Shanghai Bank and others in this city for the supply of funds. A contract can be formally signed within days. The reporter of the Shenshi News Agency inquired about the situation as follows yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Cold Storage Transportation <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>

<p>The commercial statistics conducted by the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce have been actively carried out. The first phase of financial industries has been completed, and the Commercial Statistics Series has been compiled and published. Statistics for the silk and satin industries will continue to be conducted. The details are recorded separately below.</p>

<p>Various countries have always attached importance to commercial statistics. In China, the one conducted by the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce is the first of its kind. Initially, the association was limited by funds, and although it had been repeatedly resolved by the members' congresses in the past, it could not be held. Later, Executive Committee Member Luo Qinghua formulated a concrete plan and submitted it to the Executive Committee for approval before it could proceed in an orderly manner. It was decided that Luo would preside over the matter and invite nine leaders from various industries in this city, including Xu Jiqing, to organize a Business Committee to assist in everything. However, because this matter is of great importance and has many intricacies, the banking, money, trust, cotton, sugar, paper, coal, rice, silk, and yarn industries were selected as the first phase to start with. After three months of work, the banking, money, trust, and cotton industries have been completely completed and compiled into the Commercial Statistics Series for the reference of all sectors. The banking, money, and trust industries are compiled into one volume. In addition to publishing the statistical figures, charts, and very detailed individual investigations of each company, the Financial Industry book contains Bei Songsun, Wang Yansong, Qin Runqing, Pei Yunqing, Yu Zuoting, Huang Suchu, Yan Chengde, Li Wenjie, and others. The Cotton Industry book contains Chen Songyuan, Ke Ganchen, and others who have written articles. The past review, current situation description, and future predictions of each have detailed writing and unique insights. The three books have now been published and have made no small contribution to the commercial statistics data of our country.</p>

<h3 id="e189">Li Shizeng Initiates Educational Savings Deposits; Entrusts Shanghai Trust Company to Handle <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Li Shizeng of the World Society, in view of the fact that in recent years, students studying abroad often drop out due to insufficient tuition fees, which is deeply regrettable, initiated educational savings deposits so that there is adequate preparation beforehand, and they will not feel financially strained at the last minute. He discussed this idea with the Shanghai Trust Company, and the company formulated a plan in which the depositor budgets the amount needed and deposits a certain amount of principal at once. After that, the company will remit a fixed amount to the student on a regular basis to pay tuition fees. The deposit period will be determined according to needs, with the longest being monthly payments for as long as seven years. The interest rate is favorable, and the procedures are convenient. Yesterday, when the World Society sent off this year's students to the World School in Geneva, Mr. Li Shizeng invited the chairman of the company, Yang Jiemei, executive directors Guo Bingwen and Xu Jiying, and general and deputy managers, etc., to a tea party with the students' families, and announced this plan. The families of the students unanimously agreed, and each, according to their own situation and the required tuition fees, handed over the money to the company for deposit, and it will be remitted on schedule according to the regulations.</p>

Wang Jingqi, the former envoy to Belgium, heard the news and went to see it. He saw that the spirit was commendable, and it was especially rare to include the works of so many artists from all over the country. Therefore, he specifically requested the organizers to add the oil paintings of his two daughters to the exhibition. Therefore, starting yesterday, it has been completely refreshed, adding nine works including flowers, still lifes, and figures, all of which were large works made in Europe.</p>
<h3 id="e191">The Success of Chinese Reproduction of Car Tires <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Yu Zhangtiankai, a giant in industry and commerce, a researcher in physics, chemistry, and mechanics, is excellent in learning and rich in perseverance. In the past, he used his experience to invent many kinds of electrical appliances and daily necessities, such as electric light bulb copper heads, etc. Famous electrical appliance factories all over the world competed to purchase them, and his reputation has long been known far and wide. Now, he has brought out his remaining energy to research artificial rubber and invented the reproduction of car tires, using discarded and useless old car tires, using scientific principles, to reproduce them into new ones, and they are strong, durable, and priced very cheaply. It is a gospel for those who own cars and operate transportation businesses. Therefore, as soon as the samples came out, people competed to buy them. When foreign merchants stationed in Shanghai heard the news, they frantically reduced the price of each tire, which used to sell for more than two hundred yuan, to the lowest price of more than one hundred yuan to compete. Inquiring about the car tire business, Chinese people have never manufactured or operated it, so it has always been arbitrarily manipulated by foreign merchants. Now, fortunately, reproduced car tires have been launched, so that foreign merchants cannot monopolize them. After being shocked, they have to lower prices to compete. It is a fact that our people have stopped leakage and recovered many rights and interests. It is heard that the factory has set up a new factory site on Robert Road, covering a large area, and has also set up a business department on Jiangxi Road, named China Tire Manufacturing Company, which has already started business. On the one hand, it has entrusted the Far East Company on Baker Road as its local manager, while the foreign manager is still being negotiated.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Shanghai Financial Community Bids Farewell to Fan Dusheng Returning to the Northwest; Preparations for the Daxin Industrial Bank Completed <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Important figures in the local financial community, Lin Kanghou, Gu Yubo, Zhang Xusheng, Sun Houzai, etc., organized the Daxin Industrial Bank, with the aim of helping the countryside and developing the Northwest. The Northwest authorities also strongly supported this, so they specially telegraphed Fan Dusheng to come south to participate in the preparations. Mr. Fan has been in Shanghai for almost a month, and has been consulting with various promoters and shareholders on everything, including organizational procedures and plans for developing the Northwest. The funds have also been fully collected. The preparation of the Shanghai headquarters has gradually been completed. It is expected to officially open within the next two months. All plans for using finance to assist development in the Northwest have also been discussed and decided by Mr. Fan Dusheng and various shareholders and preparation directors Gu, Zhang, and Sun. Mr. Fan is eager to leave Shanghai and return to Xi'an to carry out development matters. At 6 pm on the afternoon, the Shanghai financial community, led by Gu Yubo, Zhang Xusheng, Sun Houzai, Chai Chuangui, Gu Wensheng, Wei Nanbiao, Shen Jingzhong, Tao Jiwei, Gu Yaosheng, and more than fifty others, held a banquet at the Atlantic to bid farewell to Mr. Fan Dusheng's return to the Northwest. Many Chinese and foreign guests attended. Mr. Gu and others entertained them at the banquet. Sun Houzai, on behalf of the shareholders, gave a speech on the practice of initiating the Daxin Industrial Bank with the aim of helping the countryside and developing the Northwest, stating that the Northwest has abundant treasures and is the only fundamental place for China's rejuvenation. In recent years, many who have advocated developing the Northwest have sat and talked, but failed to take action. The Daxin Industrial Bank is based on this perseverance, and actually strives to achieve the goal of developing the Northwest to enrich the country and benefit the people. Mr. Fan Dusheng is an important figure in the Northwest. Now, he resolutely participates in the Daxin organization and undertakes all development assistance in the Northwest, which can especially make things twice as effective with half the effort. Mr. Fan also rose and spoke, listing the abundance of resources in the Northwest, the many gold and coal mines, and the vast amount of wasteland. If the Chinese people do not develop it in time, abandoning the benefits to the land is truly regrettable. Looking at the current international situation, the development of the Northwest is the only way for our country to survive. Now, all the shareholders of Daxin can be so enthusiastic in carrying out the project, proceeding from reality with practical strength, not relying on empty words, and not pursuing grandiose goals. I participate in the organization and am willing to use my inherent meager strength to assist the Shanghai financial community in their common advancement, which will benefit not only the people of the Northwest, but also the interests of our entire country, and so on.</p>

<p>A Ningbo woman, Chen Xu, (29 years old) residing at No. 4, Jiaxiang Lane, Danfeng Road in the city, went to Xiaodongmen to buy clothing materials at 3:10 pm yesterday. When she reached the vicinity of the Dachang Silk Shop, a man came towards her and, without asking why, suddenly pulled down the woman's trousers, revealing her curves. Some hooligans and idlers clapped and made frivolous comments. The woman, in embarrassment, cried for help. Fortunately, Feng Xuehen of the Ninth Post in the area heard the alarm and arrived, chased and caught the man who pulled the trousers, and took him to the Second Precinct of the First District for questioning. According to the interrogation by Section Chief Liu, the defendant confessed his name as Ye Hongchang, from Hangzhou, 40 years old, working as a teaboy in the Central Hotel. As for pulling off Chen Xu's trousers while walking, it was indeed due to drunkenness. The section chief considered it related to public order and morals, and originally intended to hand him over to the bureau for severe handling, but because the defendant pleaded bitterly, he was leniently punished as a warning.</p>

<p>The "Xinshenglong" sand barge from Beikou was loaded with soybean oil, northern goods, etc. in Dalian and set sail for Shanghai. When sailing to the waters of Mount Dajishan, it suddenly encountered a large gang of pirates, driving two pirate ships, sailing at high speed against the wind. They opened fire and ordered them to stop. The "Xinshenglong" shipowner, surnamed Ye, seeing this, immediately instructed the helmsman to retreat. The two pirate ships chased after them, continuing to open fire, killing two crew members. At this point, the crew members were terrified and captured. The pirates, holding guns or knives and sticks, swarmed onto the ship, driving all the crew members into the bow of the ship. The pirates went to shipowner Ye's room, searched and looted more than seven hundred yuan in cash from the account box, and threw more than ten account books into the sea. Then, they searched the crew members, without exception. Among them, two crew members resisted the pirate search and were kidnapped by the pirates. Before leaving, the pirates, fearing that the ship would chase after them, smashed the ship's rudder, making it impossible to sail. The two pirate ships sailed east against the wind. The "Xinshenglong" ship's rudder was smashed by the pirates, resulting in a loss of sailing power. It drifted on the ocean surface for a day and night. Later, fortunately, a foreign warship passed by and saw it, and towed the "Xinshenglong" ship to Chongming to anchor. Yesterday, shipowner Ye took a boat from Chongming to Shanghai to report to the cargo owners and borrow silver dollars to purchase coffins for the two crew members who were killed by the pirates and to try to rescue the kidnapped crew members. It is said that the hull of the ship was also damaged in many places by the pirates' gunfire, and it can only be sailed after repairs. The amount stolen, including repair costs, is approximately 5,000 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e201">Old Collection of Rare Books for Sale <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Wulin is a treasure trove of humanities, so rare thread-bound books are primarily from Hangzhou. During the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods, famous book collectors included Shousongtang, Xiaoshantang, Zhenqitang, and Zhibuzu Zhai. Their influence continued, and in the late Qing Dynasty, to modern times, collections such as Jiahuitang, Ding's, Fenghuatang, and Yang's were still rich. However, they have been separately entered into the Jiangnan Library, Peking University, and Tsinghua University. The only remaining large collection is the Jin family's Zhihuatang. Compared to the Ding and Yang families, it cannot be compared. However, the Jin family is a descendant of a prominent local family. Their ancestors held important positions in the capital during the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods for decades. The collection of their ancestors and fathers was also not small, and among them were finely engraved famous annotated manuscripts that were difficult to find elsewhere. Jin's descendants, recently seeking food in all directions, worried that the collection would be scattered and lost, so they will sell it together with stone inscriptions. A detailed catalog has been compiled. The Jin family only wants to dispose of the collection, so the pricing is deliberately low, not competing with bookstores for profit. It is heard that many varieties are priced at only a few corners, not exceeding one yuan, so that poor scholars can also share the benefits and avoid the regret of missing out.</p>

The next morning at 6 o'clock, the teaboy knocked on the door to empty the chamber pot, but there was no response. He pried the door open and found that Hong had already died. He immediately reported to the police station, which sent detectives to investigate. The body was transported to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for examination. As there were no relatives of the deceased, a report was made to Prosecutor Chen of the Second Special Court, who confirmed that the deceased had indeed died by hanging himself. The body was handed over to Tongren Fuyuan Hall for burial, pending identification by relatives.</p>

<p>Dear Editor, I am writing in response to a news article published on the 3rd of this month that a friend informed me of. After reviewing it, I was extremely surprised. Upon investigation, the office was established by Lawyer Qian Yuan when he was practicing law, and I was stationed there to take care of matters. My ambition is to pursue education, and I have no time to attend to other affairs, and even less so to misappropriate the title of lawyer. The report stated that I, Ji Chao, was referred to as a lawyer, which I believe is based on inaccurate information. I am sincerely concerned that the public may not understand the truth, so I have specially sent this letter to request your newspaper to make a correction. I am most sincerely anticipating this. Sincerely, Ji Chao, June 8th.</p>
<p>Reading and Answering Questions</p>
<h3 id="e214">On the Contradictions of Life (2) <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday evening, we answered the first of the three questions raised by Mr. Li. Due to space constraints in this newspaper, we were unable to publish the full answer. Today, we will continue to publish the unfinished portion and further discuss the first part of the second question. Because the discussion for today and tomorrow will be more theoretical, please read carefully. The more we discuss this question, the easier it will become to understand. There are also brilliant examples for the readers' reference in life. - Editor</p>
<p>How do we explain the inherent contradiction of the life process itself? This means that a person's life cannot be separated from the social environment in which they live. They cannot be immune to the influence of the objective social existence. At the same time, they are a human being with flesh and blood and cannot be immune to the dictates of physiological laws. The contradiction of society, therefore, determines the contradiction of life. The contradictions of previous societies were not as great as those of modern society, so the reflection of contradictions in the lives of ancient people was also more moderate, and that was the reason. Under the feudal social system, because there were contradictions between landlords and serfs, naturally, two different conflicting thoughts would form in people's minds. Because feudal morality advocated asceticism, the opposition between morality and sexual desire would be presented in people's behavior. All of these become forms of conflict and are bound to be manifested as open and covert struggles in people's behavior. In the literature under the feudal system, we have seen many moving and tragic dramas of the conflict between love and morality, and customs. The lives of the protagonists in these stories sometimes reached extremes, and therefore, countless people committed suicide. Can we say that a young man or woman who commits adultery under asceticism is immoral? If we stand from a scientific standpoint to examine, we do not find it strange or immoral. We only feel that the contradiction presented in the lives of these "criminal" young men and women is "Should morality be maintained or should physiological needs be satisfied?" Can we call the contradictions in thought or action caused by this morbid or irregular?</p>
<p>Of course, from a legal point of view, it should be discussed separately.</p>
<p>Since human life is a reflection of objective social existence, the more contradictory and fragmented the society, especially in today's chaotic social changes, the more complex and contradictory human life becomes. This is not only manifested in thought, but also in action. All of this needs no explanation. As long as we look back at the lives of our ancestors eighty years ago and compare them with our current lives, we can suddenly understand.</p>
<p>The above answers the first theme raised by Mr. Li, explaining that the phenomenon of contradictions in life is determined by the inherent contradiction of the life process itself. It is not appropriate to discuss in detail the three aspects of contradictions in modern life.</p>
<p>(3) Why are there contradictions between thoughts?</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the phenomenon of contradictions in life is a manifestation of the conflicting contradictions of the life process. Life is a process, constantly changing and developing. The driving force that constitutes this change and development is naturally contradiction, but this contradiction is only a reflection of the social and natural development process. After the active role of human practice in social life, it becomes the fighting force that drives the flow of life.</p>
<p>So-called thought and action are inherently inseparable. Thought itself is originally a kind of action. To oppose thought and action is not a correct view. However, because thought is a latent action, unlike the concrete manifestation of action, it forms two different aspects in form. Because the process of shifting from latent action to concrete action is a rushing process, contradictions arise between the two. Furthermore, regarding the so-called contradictions between thoughts, it is only because thought is also a process, constantly changing, and what promotes the change of thought is the conflict between several different factors that are reflected in people's minds. The same principle applies to contradictions between actions. No need to elaborate. In short, in this section, we do not intend to completely separate these three aspects. The reason for separating the narratives is for the convenience of explanation. Readers should not misunderstand that they are unrelated to each other.</p>
<p>First, let's explain why thoughts present a contradictory phenomenon.</p>
<p>Since thought cannot stop at a certain stage, it must naturally develop. This includes: new thoughts and old thoughts cannot coexist and cannot but conflict, because this shift must be through practice. Social practice reflected in people's thinking is naturally colorful, but no matter how complex, intricate, diverse, and rich social practice is, what is reflected in people's thinking is not like taking a photo and taking it all in as it is. Because people's thinking itself has a dynamic effect, it has the dynamic effect of accepting a certain film and rejecting a certain film. This is due to his special living conditions. Special living conditions are the boundary markers that constitute the development of a person's thought. But this is not to say that thought has no way to go when it reaches this boundary marker, it can still develop, but it must first destroy this boundary marker. Naturally, when thought reaches the process of destroying the boundary marker, it must go through thousands of times of rushing and fighting. This road cannot be imagined as a smooth straight line, but is often winding. During this period, the storm of thought forms the contradictory phenomenon between thought and thought. Furthermore, in terms of the development of thought, thought is always a bit conservative, and external images are often not easily absorbed, and many fierce battles must also be gone through during this period. Even with regard to the thought process that is loyal to one's own special living environment, it is not that someone is born with the content of this thought. He must also go through a stage from unconsciously gradually entering consciousness. Contradictions of thought are bound to occur in this journey as well, forming a kind of contradictory phenomenon.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the development process of thought is always progressive, but in today's society, it is not uncommon for the ruling thought to conquer the ruled thought and absorb the thought of other classes as its content. It can be said that thought can also develop downward, but this also has a certain limit, up to the point before one's own class becomes conscious. However, whether upward or downward, contradictions will appear in the process.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is extremely normal for thoughts to conflict and present contradictions. However, sometimes it takes an extremely subtle state, and sometimes it is clearly obvious. This is the order in which the thought process changes from gradual to sudden. If there is no gradual change, there will naturally be no sudden change. With gradual change, there cannot but be sudden change. For example, a person who is determined to commit suicide, his suicide is not decided overnight, his pessimistic thoughts have long existed before the suicide. Suicide is just a sudden change. Some people think it is very strange to see a person's betrayal, but in fact, this is a shallow view. Zheng Xiaoxu's willingness to be a traitor has its own process of being a traitor, it is not achieved in one night.</p>
<p>As for the small contradictions manifested in thought, they naturally occur every day. A linguist may often make jokes in his daily speech, and a logician may often say many illogical things. These are all contradictions, small waves in the process of rushing, and are not surprising.</p>

<h3 id="e224">|Excerpts from Speeches| Mayor Wu's Speech <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>Commander-in-chief, instructors, and students, in today's world, peace cannot be maintained internationally without armaments, and national independence and ethnic survival cannot be maintained without strength. China has faced extreme difficulties in the past, and is now facing multiple national crises, but China's future is bright. The reason China has been so difficult in the past and present is that it has lacked substantial armaments and strength for decades. The future of China lies in the youth of today. Today's youth are the masters of the future, but to be a master, one must have knowledge and ability to manage the country in the future. Therefore, the Kuomintang and the National Government must educate and train the youth of China today. In terms of academic education, we must equip the youth with modern knowledge so that they can continue to build the country in the future. In terms of military training, we must militarize all students so that they can hold weapons to defend the nation in the future. This kind of education and training is to strengthen the power of the people, so that they can shoulder the great responsibilities of the country and hold weapons to defend the nation in times of national crisis. Now we are preparing to strengthen human resources and national power, but students and youths must not forget the spirit of fearlessness that Sun Yat-sen told us, and the morals of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame, responsibility, and order that Chiang Kai-shek told us. Chinese youth have been too scattered in the past. Military training can militarize them, and a strict organization can transform customs. I hope students will thoroughly implement this, and in the future, they will definitely become good and powerful citizens, and only then will they be qualified to be masters of China and build China's national rejuvenation.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Director Pan's Speech <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>Today, after watching your march, I feel very satisfied. The enemy is always laughing at us. Now, we can achieve this result with only two hours of military training each week. No other nation can do this, and no other country can achieve this result with only two hours of military training each week. This is very comforting. Shanghai is the center of China's economy and culture. Its position is very important. Students, you must know that Shanghai's material construction is built with the blood of the Chinese mainland flowing into Shanghai, which is why this modern Shanghai was built. In Shanghai, we are constantly subjected to enemy interference and oppression. Young students, we must not forget that many students spend their spare time going to dance halls, and consider it fashionable to wear Western suits and speak foreign languages. These are not the Chinese youths. Therefore, the meaning of military training is entirely the lifeline of the Chinese nation, and it is to teach people how to be citizens and how to survive. In the past, student movements have shed blood many times, and the lessons of the May 30th Massacre show that we have no military power. The Indian revolution has been going on for a long time without success, also because it lacks armed forces. Therefore, today, regardless of any nation, education is advancing on both fronts, and military training is so important that all countries are implementing a conscription system. Before China implements conscription, it is necessary to train the youth to defend the country in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Director Pan's Speech <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>Today, seeing the achievements of the students, I am very excited. The purpose of military training is to have the power to defend oneself and the country. To defend oneself and the country, one must have the spirit to hold weapons to defend the nation. In military training, it is especially hoped that everyone will pay attention to unity. One must have a spirit of sincere unity. If one only receives military skills training and neglects the spirit of unity, it is like having only the skin and neglecting the spirit. In the end, one will still not be able to defend oneself and the country. In the past, many Chinese armies could not save the country, and this was the reason. Now we are paying attention to student military training, which means incorporating soldiers into learning, building the foundation of a new army in schools, and only with a spirit of unique love and unity can we make up for the shortcomings of the past and achieve our desired goals.</p>
<h3 id="e227">Director Wu's Speech <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>Today, inspecting the military training of Shanghai's high schools and above, we should have a profound feeling, that is, since the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident, the people of the whole country have known the danger of the country and the nation. Therefore, in this period of severe national crisis, everyone knows the weakness of self-defense capabilities, which has caused the enemy to attack repeatedly. We must avenge our humiliation, defend the country, and revive</p>
<p>the nation. First, we must strengthen our strength, especially by building that strength on the youth. The youth are the soldiers standing at the forefront. The country has reached a very critical point, and they must be the vanguard. At the same time, the world crisis is imminent. A major war in 1936 is about to break out. China must strive forward in these two or three years to cope with this major war. This depends entirely on the youth of the whole country redoubling their efforts to strengthen their strength, and only then can they save the country and the nation.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Director He's Speech <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>Director He's reply briefly stated that today is the first day of the inspection of military training students in Shanghai. He received many speeches from the Chief Inspector and guests, and will accept them and follow their instructions to work hard on national military training. However, he himself is deeply concerned that he does not have enough sincerity to move towards the great goal of national military training and shoulder the great task of national rejuvenation.</p>
<h3 id="e229">The Great Education Federation Yesterday Issued a "Declaration to Maintain the Dignity of Professors": Academic Morality Is the Foundation of Professors; Enticing and Confusing Youth Is Not Tolerated by National Law <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>The Federation of University Faculty and Staff in this city previously submitted a proposal on how to maintain the dignity of professors at its tenth joint meeting of executive and supervisory committees, which was referred to the Standing Committee for review. It is now known that the proposal has been resolved by the fourth meeting of the Standing Committee and will be issued as a declaration. The full text of the declaration is excerpted below: Since its inception, this Federation has advocated the two major propositions of cultural revival and academic salvation as the fundamental plans for survival. Over the years, colleagues have sharpened their minds day and night, based on this meaning, to encourage each other, and have worried and pondered day and night, also based on this meaning, to call on comrades. Since the establishment of this Federation until now, a year has passed in a flash. Although restricted by financial, temporal, and human resources, the aspirations and accomplishments have failed to reach even one in ten thousand. However, within the meager reach of colleagues, we have always tried our best to create</p>
<h3 id="e230">An Academic Environment <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>to stimulate profound interest, to cultivate integrity and conduct, to preserve the national essence, and to transform declining customs, in order to create a trend that can create public opinion and moral force, and win social sympathy. This is what colleagues often take comfort in, and it is also enough to plead not guilty to the people of the country. Establishing a country and cultivating people is a century-old plan, which lies in education. The way of education lies not only in imparting knowledge, but also in the influence of personality. Today's youth in schools are the masters of China in the future. The relationship between professors and students is no different from that between parents and children. As a teacher, one must act as a model for others, and one's words must be a law for others. Its influence on the country and society is extremely important. Therefore, university professors should</p>
<h3 id="e231">Cultivate Morality <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>enrich knowledge, rectify oneself and lead by example, shape and cultivate, and silently transform and influence. Only then can they fulfill the great responsibilities of imparting the Tao, teaching, and resolving doubts, and fulfill the natural responsibility of becoming a model of virtue and talent. These are the golden rules that colleagues always uphold without losing, and they are also the guidelines that the entire academic community should practice. However, based on the observations of colleagues over the years, this meaning has not yet been understood by the entire academic community. At a time when the Ministry of Education has repeatedly issued orders to rectify the academic style of the country and the government is exhausted to promote propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame, there are still some individuals who are suspicious of virtuous talents, hindering meritorious deeds, issuing orders from above, twisting and rising to the hall, engaging in horizontal and vertical intrigue, hooking and fighting, tilting and squeezing, inciting discord, plotting secret calculations, slanderously injuring, excluding dissidents, pursuing selfishness and plundering, and seeking to vent personal grievances, causing scholars to be in danger and people to be wary. Pure youth become accustomed to fraud and schemes, and the sacred altar becomes like a</p>
<h3 id="e232">Political Battleground <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>sacrificing students' wealth, damaging the country's vitality, and destroying the inherent morality of the nation. The negative impact it gives to students and the hidden dangers it plants in society are truly unimaginable. Colleagues witness this with fear and worry about it. We have thought deeply and carefully that the best way to save the situation is to restore the ancient style of respecting teachers and valuing the Tao. The thorough method is to return to the sincere cooperation of the principal, professors, and students. There must be teachers who teach tirelessly before there can be students who never tire of learning. There must be a principal who treats scholars with courtesy and is happy to do good before there can be professors who maintain their integrity and devote themselves to academics. Professors must take</p>
<h3 id="e233">Academic Morality <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>as the foundation and should be kind, respectful, and dignified towards students, respecting each other with morality. They cannot be induced by power and should not degrade their personality, giving young people a bad impression. Students must respect teachers and value the Tao, and they must be able to distinguish right from wrong. They must not blindly follow and echo, allowing themselves to be driven and striving to become talents for society and pillars of the country. The principal must be humble, know how to use people well, love goodness and forget power, and should not regard the school as a government office, treating professors as subordinates. If these three parties work together, the school will have a harmonious atmosphere, and teachers and students will be as close as children and siblings. Only then can the entire success of education be achieved and the great task of revival be shouldered together. From now on, if anyone dares to have ulterior motives,</p>
<h3 id="e234">Entice and Confuse Youth <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>to plot wrongdoing and manipulate the school, they will be pests in the cultural world and will not be tolerated by national cleansing discipline. Those who cherish themselves will be ashamed to associate with them, and colleagues should rise up to attack them, expel them from the academic community, and abandon them with the people of the country. As the ancients said, the more a gentleman yields, the more presumptuous a villain becomes. If the Tao is one foot high, the devil is ten feet high. Colleagues only rely on personality and righteousness to fight the devil. This declaration is hereby made.</p>

<p>Since the Shanghai War, the financial revenue of this city has suddenly decreased sharply. Therefore, the various expenses of the municipal government have had to be greatly tightened. However, the educational expenses of the city have always been maintained in order to ensure that the municipal schools are not affected by the war. At times, the municipal treasury is tight, and there may be some delays, but Mayor Wu and Directors Pan (Education) and Cai (Finance) will definitely find ways to issue them as soon as possible. Previously, teachers of primary and secondary schools in this city petitioned the municipal government and the Education Bureau due to overdue education fees. Mayor Wu was responsible for planning and explained the financial difficulties of the municipal government to the teachers, and the matter came to an end. Recently, the municipal treasury has become extremely tight again, resulting in the delayed payment of the expenses of municipal primary schools. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, eighty-six representatives from the primary school teachers of the city petitioned the Education Bureau and the Municipal Government. Director Pan of the Education Bureau was out on official business. He informed them by telephone of the efforts to raise funds and said that he had contacted the Municipal Government and the Finance Bureau. The expenses for April will be issued in mid-month, and the expenses for May will be issued in the next ten days. It is hoped that the expenses for June can be issued before the summer vacation. After the principal of Xicheng Primary School informed the representatives, the representatives went to the Municipal Government to petition. Secretary-General Yu Hongjun met with them. The representatives immediately stated the reasons for the petition. Yu expressed sympathy and promised to instruct the Finance Bureau to do its best to raise funds in order to issue them as soon as possible, and told the representatives to work with peace of mind. The representatives returned satisfied.</p>

<p>This year's Davis Cup tennis tournament, the second week of the European Zone, began yesterday. The final eight countries will compete for the semi-finals. These eight countries are Australia, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, and New Zealand. The match between Australia and Japan is the most watched because the winner is the champion of the European Zone, without question. Yesterday's results showed that Australia won two singles matches against Japan, taking a strong lead in the second half. Therefore, the finals between the European and American Zones will inevitably belong to Australia and the United States. Yesterday's results are as follows:</p>

<p>(London Correspondence) France seems to have a glimmer of hope in this year's Davis Cup. France lost to Austria in the first week, and will meet Germany in the second week. The results should be better, but they will face the winner of Japan and Australia in the semi-finals, and I am afraid they will lose again. Therefore, general public opinion is leaning towards other countries. Mr. Daninos, in the tennis and golf magazine, argued that the United States, due to its abundance of talent, should be regarded as the most serious opponent. The United States will face the winner of Japan and Australia in the zonal match. Japan will lose to Australia due to the loss of Sato. Mr. Da also said that it would not be easy for Britain to get its hands on the United States or Australia, because both can develop their strengths on the Wimbledon grass. However, the history of the Davis Cup proves that single players of equal strength often win. Britain's Han Lei and Austin meet this condition, so their hope seems to belong to Britain.</p>

<p>According to a letter from the Qunyi Basketball Team, "To Whom It May Concern: Having read the newspaper report, we have learned that the Hunan Basketball Competition organized by the Liuxing Sports Association has falsely accused our team members of assaulting the inspector, Mr. Wu Zibin, and has therefore cancelled the qualifications of all of our team's A and B groups. According to the competition on that day, although Mr. Wu's refereeing was repeatedly negligent, our team members have always adhered to the rules and morals without any impolite behavior. Therefore, our team has four reasons for protest (the protest letter has been submitted to the association). The people who clashed with Mr. Wu that day were all spectators who were caused by unfair emotion. Now, the association is calling a stag a horse, shifting the blame on others, and after cancelling our team's qualifications, the overall championship can be manipulated and won by the Liuxing team organized by the association. That is, the team temporarily appointed Mr. Wu Zibin, a member of the Shanzhong team, which is a strong team in the same group as our team, as an inspector. This point is obvious to discerning people (last week, the referee of the women's group Aiguo vs. Liuxing match was manipulated by the Liuxing Sports Association, so the victory went to Liuxing. The Aiguo team, which was certain to win the women's group championship, was disappointed. This matter caused a public outcry from the outside world). This matter concerns the reputation of our team. The team will lodge another protest with the association, and hereby makes this statement. Sincerely, Qunyi Basketball Team, June 8th."</p>

<h3 id="e265">Pick-up Revival Method <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— Ming Xiang</p>
<p>The pick-up (commonly known as a record player cartridge) is an indispensable accessory for high-end radios. After being used for a while, its effectiveness often gradually decreases, and the sound becomes weak. The main cause is the U-shaped permanent magnet inside. Although there is an armature between the two poles of this magnet, the magnetic force lines are not interrupted, but the armature must leave a considerable gap with the magnet in order to move, so the magnetic circuit can never be completely sealed. The magnetic force is often lost, and after a long time, it gradually disappears completely and becomes ineffective. The method of revival is simply to reapply a strong permanent magnetic field.</p>
<p>The first step is to identify the polarity of the pick-up magnet. The method is very simple, you can test it with a magnetic needle. The point indicated by the north pole of the magnetic needle is the south pole of the pick-up. Then prepare another horseshoe-shaped permanent magnet, which must have very reliable magnetism. The size should be selected to match the pick-up, and place it flat on the pick-up. When placing it, be sure to pay attention to the polarity of both ends of the horseshoe magnet, which must be opposite to that of the pick-up, to be effective. Otherwise, it cannot be revived. The position of the horseshoe magnet should be such that its two ends are close to the bottom of the pick-up. Then tighten it so that it does not move (as shown in the picture).</p>
<p>Place the record on the turntable, turn on the radio's amplifier, and then place the pick-up mentioned above on it, or you will be surprised. This suddenly loud tone is sometimes more beautiful and pleasant than a new pick-up.</p>
<p>Finally, there is one more point to remedy. Because the newly added horseshoe magnet increases the weight of the pick-up, it strengthens the pressure on the record. The rotation of the record will be hindered, even stopped. The remedy is to add an appropriate weight to the other end of the pick-up handle to balance it. This way, the pressure of the pick-up needle can be adjusted to the appropriate degree.</p>
<h3 id="e266">Matching Method of Common Antenna <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Zhi</p>
<p>Using one antenna for several radios to receive signals was once considered impossible. This is because adjusting one machine will affect the reception of other radios, causing the signal to change and cause interference. However, if this antenna is connected in series with a set of separate coils and capacitors, changing the total impedance (Impededance) from each radio to the antenna, in other words, even if the total impedance from each radio to the antenna is different, it is as if there are several antennas. Then, whether one, two, three, or four machines use this common antenna, it will not affect the reception. It is the same as each machine using its own antenna.</p>
<p>The matching method is shown in Figure 1. This common antenna can be used for four radios. L1 is 20 turns, L2 is 30 turns, L3 is 40 turns, L4 is 50 turns. Use 28-gauge enameled wire to wind around a bakelite tube with a diameter of 2 inches. C is a 0.0001 farad fixed capacitor. After the coils and capacitors are grouped and matched according to Figure 1, they are placed in a shielding cover and led out to the lead-in wires of each radio (as shown in Figure 2) for application.</p>
<h3 id="e267">Wireless Radio Treasure Finder <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>There is a story in "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" that says: "There was a man named Feng who released a giant turtle with a white spot on its forehead. Later, the giant turtle repaid his great kindness and gave him a little man only an inch long. Since Feng wore this turtle treasure, he could see all the gold and silver treasures hidden under the Yellow Springs. Later, he dug up hundreds of thousands of coins in his bedroom, and countless wide objects in various places. Feng became as rich as a prince because of this." This is, of course, a story fabricated by a novelist, and no one dares to believe that there is such a fact. However, the treasure finder introduced in this article can truly assume the task of the turtle treasure and indicate the location of the treasure for you. When an old-fashioned regenerative radio without an isolation device is in use, if our hands approach any part of the radio, a kind of crazy screech will often be caused in the speaker. This is because the radio is sensing the human body. The basic principle of the treasure finder described below is designed based on this special phenomenon.</p>
<p>The first picture shows the appearance of the finder. A is the transmitter, (Transmitter) its internal structure is shown in the second picture, L is a loop coil wound around the outside of the wooden box, a total of ten turns, with a center tap drawn out at the fifth turn. B is the receiver. (Receiver) Its internal structure is shown in the third picture. The loop coil L is also wound ten times.</p>
<p>When using, first adjust the receiver to resonate with the transmitter. Then vibrate the wooden box of the transmitter to the extent that no sound is heard in the receiver. At this time, the coils L must form a right angle with L. Usually, the surrounding radio waves are scattered in a regular pattern (as shown in the upper part of the fourth picture), but once they encounter metals such as gold and silver, a part of the radio waves will be absorbed and distorted. Since the emitted radio waves are unbalanced (Balance), the earphone will get audio signals.</p>
<p>In order to further improve the sensitivity of the receiver, R can be adjusted or a regenerative coil can be installed in the detection tube (as shown by the lines in the third picture) to generate oscillation. In this way, what is usually heard in the earphone is only the frequency difference between the transmitter and the receiver (Beat Frequency), a kind of hissing screech. When the finder encounters metal, the frequency of the transmitter or receiver itself will be affected, and as a result, the tone generated in the earphone will change.</p>
<p>The materials required for the finder and their values are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Transmitter part</p>
<p>One wooden box (dimensions are shown in Figure 1A) C (variable capacitor) ·0.00025 µfd Cl (fixed capacitor) ·0.00025 µfd ·lC3 l·5µf·Rl l5 ohms R lI l megohm·</p>
<p>(2) Receiver part</p>
<p>One wooden box (dimensions are shown in Figure 1B) CC1 l·0.00025mf·Variable capacitor, C2 l·0.00025mt·lC3 l·0.00025mf·lC4, C5mf, fixed capacitors R1 l2 l me gohm, R2 l22/Iohm; fixed resistor R3 l0·I00000·0hm variable resistor.</p>
<h3 id="e268">Small Experience Volume <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Shanzhang</p>
<p>Installed a radio for someone else, and the volume was not very satisfactory after testing. Therefore, I suspected that the antenna was too short, or the primary coil was too small, so I added a coil (about forty or fifty turns) to the antenna post. Although the volume increased, the selectivity was not good. When I moved it to the ground wire post, the result was the same. Finally, I added a coil to each of the ground and antenna connecting posts, making the two coils parallel. The selectivity was also not good. I then made the two coils perpendicular, and I was satisfied. The volume increased, and there was no problem with the selectivity.</p>
<p>Materials for Making Fixed Capacitors Yourself</p>
<p>To make fixed capacitors yourself, everyone always uses cigarette tin foil because it is easy to get and available everywhere. But in recent years, cigarette tin foil has been made of extremely thin aluminum, which is very brittle. If it is not done well, it is very easy to break, and it is necessary to redo it, which is very uneconomical in terms of time. Therefore, I found other easy-to-get materials to replace it, then the empty toothpaste tube is the best. It is thick and soft, and very easy to handle. Furthermore, the insulation of the fixed capacitor can be made of soft photographic film. The gelatin on the surface is washed away to form a transparent artificial ivory (Celluloid) thin sheet to replace the mica sheet. The results are also good. It can be used as a bypass capacitor and a grid capacitor. Soft film is not easy to get, so use waxed paper, but the insulation is inferior.</p>
<p>Shielding Cover</p>
<p>Mr. Li Yuanqing has already introduced the shielding cover in this magazine. This is just using waste. Wash a metal can clean and you can use it. Choose one with a suitable height and diameter to use as a shielding cover between vacuum tubes or coils, which is very convenient.</p>
<h3 id="e269">Single-Tube Machine with Excellent Sensitivity <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Tongkang</p>
<p>Out of a moment of interest, I will now write down the results of the experiment during this year's spring vacation, which are more satisfactory, here for the reference of those who like it.</p>
<p>Because I often see circuits for single-tube radios made with a No. 33 output power tube published in this magazine and other magazines and newspapers, it is said that the performance is superior to ordinary two-tube machines, so I became interested and tested it. The results were not bad, but the only shortcomings were unstable oscillation and uneconomical power consumption. After a short period of improvement, I gradually became satisfied. Figure 1 shows the circuit of this machine. The No. 33 vacuum tube in the original machine has been replaced with a No. 38 automotive tube here, and the performance is exactly the same as that of No. 33. Because it has one more cathode, it can be used for both AC and DC, especially when using AC power, the AC noise can be as quiet as using DC. The filament voltage is 6.3 volts and the filament current is not very large, similar to No. 33. This machine adopts electronic coupling regeneration, so the oscillation is very stable, and the noise is also the smallest. This is something that the original circuit cannot match. In short, this machine is excellent in selectivity, volume, and sound quality.</p>
<p>In the figure, coil 1 is wound with 32-gauge enameled wire in ten turns on a diameter paper or plastic tube as L, at a distance of two cents, and the same wire is wound in one hundred and twenty-five turns as L1. After winding, there is no need to cut the wire head. Draw one end and wind thirty turns in the opposite direction as L2. C is a variable capacitor for adjusting the wavelength. The capacity is 0.00035 MFD. C1 is a grid capacitor with 0.0001 MFD. C2 is a bypass capacitor with 1 MFD, which is used to avoid noise when rotating R1. C3 is a fixed capacitor with 0.002 MFD. C4 is a fixed capacitor with 0.006 MFD. R is a grid leak with 5 megohms. R1 is a 50,000-ohm potentiometer for controlling regeneration. The RFC high-frequency choke coil in the figure is closely related to the radio, so it is advisable to use a high-quality one. A electricity can be used in four series round batteries or changed from electric bell grid, B electricity is best to use one hundred and thirty-five volts or ninety volts that can be used up to one hundred and eighty volts, then the volume is even more grand, dry battery. This machine can play a small horn speaker for the entertainment of one room.</p>

<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling of Qing, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>The Chinese have a peculiar understanding of the sheng (mouth organ). Everyone considers the sheng as something that promotes lung disease. Some even say that if you split open a sheng that has been used for a slightly long time, you can often find blood inside. Although I have not witnessed this myself, there was indeed a eunuch in the palace who developed a severe cough because he blew the sheng too strenuously.</p>
<p>(The following are the pipa, guqin, trumpet, tang gong, flute, xiao, nao, and cymbals, etc. Translator's note: Most people probably know these musical instruments. The author's original text was specifically for Westerners, so it was described in great detail; therefore, there is no need to translate them directly here, so everything is omitted.)</p>
<p>The Empress Dowager's musicians all have assistants, as mentioned above. However, these assistants' musical knowledge is really not inferior to their main players. Because when performing music, the instruments used by their main players often need to be changed, and they are changed very quickly, often without informing their assistants what instrument to use. These assistants are entirely responsible for distinguishing and handing them the instruments that should be used. This, of course, cannot be handled by an amateur. Moreover, they must not only pass on the musical instrument that should be used but also hang the unused instruments on that large rack. The procedure is extremely troublesome!</p>
<p>Overall, the sound of the music played by the Empress Dowager's orchestra can truly be said to be very mysterious. When these musicians are playing, everyone wears a straight face, without any expression, like wooden puppets with mechanisms. I think that no matter how they play, they themselves have absolutely no feeling.</p>
<p>But in the Empress Dowager's eyes, apart from them, she could not find such great musicians in the world. (53)</p>
<h3 id="e273">A Glimpse of the Detention Center <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Jingyu</p>
<p>My old friend, Layman Feifei, was recently caught by the Public Security Bureau due to involvement in the × case. As usual, he should have been escorted to the General Bureau and then transferred to the judicial authorities for handling. However, after the General Bureau received him, it did not quickly transfer him to the judicial authorities but pushed him into the detention center.</p>
<p>This detention center is really so small that it cannot be smaller, and it is indeed worthy of being called a "tiny room"! A kang made of wooden planks occupies two-thirds of the entire room, so that there is not enough room in front of the kang to turn around. Looking at the bare walls, however, they are full of dazzling things, with calligraphy and paintings, which can be said to be the ultimate expression of artistic ability.</p>
<p>In terms of books, each has a tone that expresses its individuality. "When you come here, don't be angry in your belly"! is absolutely embracing optimism. "You are not a hero if you don't come here; you are not worth half a cent if you come again"! can be regarded as heroism. As for "×××'s wife is cheating"! "×××'s wife is stealing a lover"! that is a slanderous doctrine that has fallen into the "lower class" and has become "Liu Si scolding people"!</p>
<p>In terms of painting, it is even more comical. An armed comrade is facing a naked woman, making a gesture of shooting with a gun. Next to the naked woman, it is written "Pheasant! That is ×××'s wife"! There is also a long-necked, long-tailed bird with the inscription "A small portrait of ×××'s wife"! Only then do I realize that what is painted is also a pheasant: it seems that they are all mocking her origin from "Shan Liang" (mountain ridge). In addition, there are even masterpieces combining calligraphy and painting, depicting a coffin and a spirit tablet. On the front of the coffin, it is inscribed: "The coffin of the deceased ×××"! The spirit tablet also reads "The spirit tablet of ×××"! Underneath, a turtle is added, with the words "×××" written on its shell; this is enough to show that its accumulated resentment is not shallow!</p>
<p>In the corner of the wall, there are cigarette shells, scraps of paper, orange peel fruit shells... piled up like small hills, with wet water stains flowing out from the pile, and the smell of urine is unbearable! This is probably the result of the excretory work done by the fellow inmates? I don't know what the Public Security Bureau, which is responsible for promoting "cleanliness" and "hygiene," will say about this?</p>

<p>— Hu Shu</p>
<p>I haven't eaten for several days, but I don't feel hungry. This may be the only ability of a patient. Although the muscles are thinning away like melting ice, the cost of food is saved after all. For people who work one day and eat the next, if they get sick and still have to eat, that would be the end of Ada's life. Not seeing a doctor, not taking medicine, lying in bed, tossing and groaning is already enough suffering. If the stomach is not good, the poor will have to die.</p>
<p>Although Ada is a worker, because he is alone and has no burden of a wife or children, his situation is usually not too bad. He eats three large bowls of rice for each meal, a large ball of ci fan (sticky rice) in the morning, and can smoke a few Gold Mouse brand cigarettes every day. He often eats and drinks baijiu (white liquor) and peanuts until he is drunk. When he is free, he makes a pot of strong tea and tells jokes and talks about news with a few like-minded friends, not knowing what is sorrow or what is hate. He works during the carefree daytime and sleeps at night. No one will bother him, and he will not bother anyone. Except for humming a few tuneless songs when his alcohol gets to him, he always greets people with a smile and is very friendly.</p>
<p>Citizen in National Crisis</p>
<p>However, since he suddenly contracted this illness, he has suffered a major blow to his spirit, and he has begun to feel sorry for the misery of his life and the cruelty of his encounter. Although he勉强 escaped from the hands of death, his once lively body has now become like a weak and frail woman. The smile on his face has long disappeared, and the wrinkles on his forehead are even denser and deeper.</p>
<p>"Damn it, I'm not very old, but I'm so delicate like this." This was the sigh he heard when he staggered and fell on the bed after returning from work after his illness.</p>
<p>Of course, Ada, who is about fifty years old, is not considered old, and he has no worries about finding food with his strength! He thought that he was born with a bitter life, and it was enough to have a mouthful of bitter rice. As long as he was willing to endure hardship, he would not worry about not having food. But he never thought that he would be troubled by not being able to eat now!</p>
<p>But pitifully, he still said: "Fortunately, my appetite has decreased now, otherwise, I would either die of hardship or starve to death!"</p>

<p>Again I see the Water Agarwood Pavilion. Snow weighs down the branches, delicately. Emerald green, towering jade branches. For a while, I break them, filled with sorrow.

<p>Spring dots sparse plum branches after rain, Cutting the lamp wick, my thoughts are chilly. Now is the evening for joyful遊. Sadly, I return, with the moon knowing. Flowers fill the market.

<h3 id="e277">Method of Preserving Plums <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>The Book says, "If you make a soup, you only need salt and plums." Plums were known as something edible in ancient times. However, there is no explanation in the records on how to eat them. Even in other books such as "Qunfang Pu," "Nongzheng Quanshu," as well as "Ben Cao Gang Mu," and "Gujin Tushujicheng," there are records, and they can also treat diseases and serve as essential medicinal products. However, they are not very detailed. If someone could revise them and refer to the current scientific methods of preparation, I dare say that the benefits of plums would definitely be great. Therefore, I like to eat plums the most. Now, I will briefly write down several simple methods of preserving plums as follows.</p>
<p>Sugar-preserved: Take early, firm, green plums, and use a needle to prick them all around. Then soak them in a diluted solution of salt water (about four taels of salt and more than nine catties of water). After four hours, take them out, and then pour them into clear water to rinse them until the salty taste is completely removed. If you take ten catties of plums, then use six taels of cooked shellfish ash and soak them in clear water for up to twelve hours. Then remove the ash and make a sweet solution with about one catty of water and one catty of sugar. Pour the plums in, and add sugar once every two days (about a quarter of the first time) until the sweetness and plums are just right. In less than two weeks, the texture of the plum pulp will change, and when you eat it, you will only feel the sweetness and not the sourness, which is pleasant to the taste. If you often soak them in this sugary solution in the container, even after four or five years, they will not change their nature and spoil. If you don't like the color of the plums, you can also use copper sulfate or blue stone (the most convenient is to use the smallest chicken-eye coins used for making money) in the sugary solution (about two or three fen per ten catties of plums). However, do not overdo it, otherwise, it will contain excessive toxicity, not only emitting a very foul odor but also harmful to eat. If you can use the right amount, this method is very palatable, and the texture is firm and crisp, with a sound when chewed, no different from fresh plums. In the past, someone titled this kind of sugar preparation and called it "wind and rain plums," that's what it means!</p>
<p>Salt-preserved: Take green, hard, and firm plums, about two taels of salt per catty, and put them together in a ceramic container, and add hot water to prevent them from drying out. It is best to press heavy objects on top to prevent mold and other harms, and the salty taste is also easy to penetrate completely. If they are stored in a container, tightly covered to prevent air from entering, they can last a long time. If they are then dried in the sun, so that the bottom and top surfaces are all exposed to intense heat, after two or three weeks, the surface of the plums will develop a kind of salt frost, its color is pure white, and it is extremely beautiful. However, you must prevent rainwater from entering during drying. If you are not careful, it is most prone to mildew. This method was called "plum embryos" by the ancients and can be stored for more than ten years without spoiling. Because it always carries very fine salt particles, it looks quite like frost on the roof tiles, so it is also called "frost plums." If you make osmanthus and rose jam, and add the juice of these plums to it, the color of the osmanthus and roses will be even more yellow and red! Because its acidity is most capable of illuminating its pigment!</p>
<p>Medicine-preserved: Pour the plum embryos into clear water and soak them (for about ten hours) until the salt is completely removed. Then filter the water completely, and then mix them in a 50% sugar solution. It is necessary to remove the inherent sour taste of the plums. Even if the previous sugar solution is discarded, it is not a pity. Then add an extremely thick sugar solution to allow the plum pulp to seep into the sweetness until it is fully flavored. Mix with lemon slices, and mash it into a sauce. Then add cloves, mint, star anise, or extremely fragrant spices to add its qualities. Finally, add aged dried tangerine peel powder to it and expose it to the sun. At this time, it has become a sauce, and the volume of the plums has also floated and swollen. When it is slightly dry, it can be wrapped in wax paper. It can be eaten for a long time, and it is not only a refreshment during the journey, but also a medicine, because it is made with several medicinal flavors. Therefore, the words "Chen Pi Mei" (dried tangerine peel plums) sold on the market are the most famous, and this method is used!</p>
<p>Other preparation methods such as "plum paste" can be sweet or salty, depending on personal taste, and the color can also be green, yellow, red, or black. Its texture can be made into "paste," "glue," "juice," or "dew," depending on the preparation method. In the south, plum sauce is the main product, and in the north, sour plum soup is famous. Plum "juice," plum "jelly," and plum "smooth paste" are not ordinary preparation methods. Now, what is most well-known in the market is "Qing Yan Mei Zi" (clear salted plums) from Zhang Xiangfeng in Xiaonanmen, Shanghai. In addition, "Mei Pi" (plum skin) from Qingpu Zhujie Pavilion is also very famous. However, the sugar content of plum skin seems to be too heavy, and it loses the original nature of the plum. Is this perhaps evidence that most people who eat plums are afraid of sourness and like sweetness?</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 30: Watching the Bereaved Geese Off, Burying Heads to Defend the Territory, Bullet Piercing a Strong Arm, Blood Staining a Lonely City</p>
<p>Outside the house, only the sound of running footsteps could be heard, some running past, and some running back. This was precisely adding to the infinite amusement of the people in the plane. Seeing the people below from above was like ants on a hot stone, running around in confusion. He fixed his eyes on the place where people were running very densely, and with another轟 sound, he awarded a bomb. When this bomb landed, there was not only the sound that shattered people's eardrums, but also the flying sand turned into smoke and fog, rising several feet high. In that smoke and fog, a hand, a leg, and a section of body cavity of the common people flew. In short, what the people here had never dreamed of was seeing it with their own eyes. Then, following this tragedy, the sound of wailing and crying broke out again. Fortunately, there was only one plane overhead, and the number of bombs it carried was limited. Therefore, after this bomb was dropped, the plane circled twice in the sky and flew away. Although the soldiers and civilians in the fortress were very calm and did not think that this was a matter of life and death, this was the first time that the plane had visited, and the common people were running around and screaming like that, and everyone's hearts could not help but jump up. Only when the plane left did everyone's heart settle down, but the common people were still crying and shouting, and quarreling incessantly. Yin Deren stood in the open space at this time, frowning and looking at the chaotic common people. Turning his head and seeing Zhao Ziqiang standing beside him, he smiled lightly: Look at these common people, they are really pitiful and laughable. Two planes flew over the battlefield, just like we saw a few sparrows in the yard at home. What does this count for? With their chaos, it will inevitably shake the morale of the army. I'll go talk to the battalion commander. I must drive them away! As he spoke, he clenched his fists and hit them a few times in his palm. Ziqiang said: Isn't that right? We spoke to the brothers for a few hours, and it was not easy to calm people's hearts. If they scream like this, all the previous effort will be wasted. (404)</p>

<p>Silver Futures Fail to Meet Expectations, Gold Prices Continue to Fall by One Yuan; Central Bank Opens Spot Exchange Market, Tightly Approaching, Once Briefly Rebounding</p>
<p>The gold market was weak yesterday because forward silver prices failed to meet expectations. During the session, the market rebounded briefly due to the Central Bank's intervention in the spot market and the banks' strong appetite. However, market sentiment was weak, and prices eventually fell. At the beginning of the morning, overseas silver markets saw a slight decrease in British prices and an increase in American prices. The forward silver price at the Five Metals Exchange decreased slightly. London spot gold fell by nine pence. Exchange rates did not fluctuate much. American cotton rose by nine points, American wheat fell by 1.625 points, and stocks fell slightly. The off-market price opened at 13.4 yuan and then retreated. After the opening, the market was flat. Later, due to the banks' pushing up prices and the exchange market tightening, the Central Bank intervened in the spot market again, and the market rebounded. The HSBC exchange rate listing remained unchanged for both British and American currencies. At this time, the domestic market appeared slightly uncertain and weak, but market sentiment was still good, and prices hovered around six yuan for a long time. Eventually, due to the banks' strong appetite and the domestic market remaining tight, market sentiment weakened, and large investors seized the opportunity to buy aggressively. The Seattle night market silver price rose by 0.25 and remained unchanged, with no significant impact. Gold prices gradually rose, but the supply was relatively high at high prices. Large investors such as Yuansheng and Yongsheng sold heavily, while buyers in the market remained active. At noon, the market contended around seven yuan. Later, the Seattle night market silver price remained unchanged in the near term and rose by 0.125 in the long term. Although the market was stable during the session due to the banks' pushing up prices and hedging, market sentiment was high, and there was a strong desire to sell. In addition, as the industry continued to fill in US exchange rates, the domestic market gradually loosened, and gold prices gradually fell. The market situation suddenly became volatile, resulting in a further decline. During the day, the market trend reversed. There was news from foreign telegrams that the US Senate was fiercely debating the silver bill, but it had little impact. The red gold price was 1024 yuan. The market situation for the day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening price was 1014 yuan, a decrease of 1.2 yuan from the previous close. Goods opened at 3.8 yuan. The exchange market morning opening price for the near-term selling price was 1 shilling, 3 pence, 0.625 for British exchange and 30 yuan for US exchange. Zhengjin bought US dollars for September at 3.125. Yifeng, Yonghong, Licang, Changxiang, and Jin Tiao were among the goods, and gradually rose from 3.7 yuan. Zhengjin bought US dollars for September at 0.25. Upon hearing the news of the Central Bank's intervention in the spot market, the price rose to 6.7 yuan. Fuyu, Yuanchang, Yongxiang, Heyifeng, and Yong sold Tiao at high prices. The HSBC listing was expected to be flat, and gradually dropped to 5.1 yuan. Mitsui, Zhengjin, and Mitsubishi were still buying US dollars for October at 0.375. Zhengjin and Citibank bought September at 0.25. Dadecheng, Yuanmao, Yongheng, and Yu bought at low prices and rose to over six yuan again. At this time, Daxing and Yong had some supply and were still struggling, hovering around six yuan, because the banks were doing US dollars for September at 3.125. Eventually, with the banks' healthy digestion and the underlying trend remaining firm, Hengtai, Fuan, Dadecheng, Yuanchun, Zhaofeng, Changxiang, Fuxing, Yongheng, Yu, etc., bought aggressively. Although Cuitai and Yuanmao Yong sold, the night market silver price rose by 0.25, and the price gradually rose to 7.7 yuan. The banks were buying US dollars for September at 1.875. Yuansheng and Yongsheng came to supply heavily, and the price dropped to seven yuan. However, large investors such as Fuxing Yong, Yuqing Yong, Yongheng Yu, and Senchang Yong had a strong interest in buying and continued to buy Tiao, and the price rose to 7.8 yuan again. Yuansheng and Yongsheng sold again, but with strong demand from buyers, although the price retreated to 6.9 yuan, there was a lot of struggle. The noon closing price was still 1017 yuan, and the goods were sold at 6.8 yuan. Retail investors paid strongly, and the price fell slightly after the closing.</p>
<p>The after-market opening price was 1017.5 yuan, and the goods opened at 17 yuan. The Seattle night market silver price rose by 0.125. Market sentiment was relatively flat.

Therefore, treasury bond transactions have suddenly turned from dull to active, and the market price has also shown some activity. This shows that the market is still high and has not yet killed off. The future is expected to be more profitable if the 96 bonds rise. The current trend is due to no problems with the current situation, and the first half of the year is the bank settlement period, and arbitrage transactions in the financial sector have sprung up, which is an intangible price increase. 96 also has the daily gold portion of the consolidation, although only for the Japanese side of the request, has enough to shake people's hearts, so the future market price, even if there is a pullback, there is no immediate drop in the image.

With foreign wheat quotations, Chicago was slightly lower by about four or five jiao, and Canada was slightly lower by two or three jiao. However, the long positions of the outside industry, because the US-Russian wheat suffered drought losses, could not help but pay close attention, and still continued to absorb.

Until the afternoon opening, all months of trading, are seen Qingdan, but outside the industry still have to buy, Yingkou gang also have two million more packages of transactions, so the forward each month, the opening price is seen to be high, but manufacturers wait and see, this attitude, I am afraid still unreliable.

<p>The Cocoon Market in Jiangsu and Zhejiang is Coming to an End</p>
<p>Zhejiang is about to end... Jiangsu's goods are booming</p>
<p>(Shaoxing Cocoon Bank stopped weighing) Shaoxing's new cocoons were listed earlier. The cocoon production in the four villages is eight years old. The improved species is the best, and the native species is slightly inferior. The cocoon bank has weighed and collected for more than ten days, and the collection number is sufficient. The number of arrivals in the market has been rare, so they have stopped weighing one after another. The cocoon price of improved species is 25 to 30 yuan, and the native species is 14 to 20 yuan. The baking discount is not large, only 280 to 290 catties. The silk farmers who bake 100 catties of dry cocoons are all losing money.</p>

The cocoon bank has weighed and collected for more than ten days, and the amount of collection is sufficient. The cocoon price averages 25-26 yuan for improved species and 16-17 yuan for native species.

<p>(Yangzhou New Cocoon Harvest) In the Yangzhou improved silkworm area, all improved species have been hatched this year. The guidance has been effective, and the results are quite good. The new cocoon harvest is plentiful. The cocoon bank has been weighing for many days. The cocoon price is not high due to the control relationship.

<p>Yesterday's telegram from London stated that the price of tinplate had soared. The main reason was that the tinplate factories in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, and other countries had jointly signed a contract to maintain the market in order to maintain their capital and factory operations. The price has risen by several shillings compared to before. Judging from the situation in all aspects, the market price may rise again in the future. The prices are recorded below,</p>

<p>100 lbs per box 19 shillings</p>
<p>180 lbs per box 34 shillings</p>
<p>200 lbs per box 36 shillings</p>

<h3 id="e298">We Need Museums <a href="#e298" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c298" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">298</a></h3>
<p>— Walter</p>
<p>Many things are self-evident in the West, but in our country require much explanation. For example, the need to drink water when thirsty is unquestionable for Westerners, but in our country, many disagree: some people fundamentally oppose drinking water or tea, advocating only eating a preserved plum or olive. Smoking a cigarette is no big deal daily; however, in the interior, it is forbidden, and soldiers seize them on the road.</p>
<p>But now, let us raise our voices again: We need museums!</p>
<p>The reason? There is no reason, we unconditionally need to build large museums.</p>
<p>Predictably, many will object: "The 'Manchukuo' has already been established in the Northeast, and people's livelihoods are so precarious. Are you heartless people going to waste the nation's money building useless museums? Our Dr. Zhang Jingsheng said it well: Selling Chinese antiques to foreign countries is very appropriate, because the money can be used to buy guns and cannons, which can be used to fight foreigners, and after defeating the foreigners, we can take them back. Like the precious jade of Chu, one does not need to return the lamb; it only adds age. Moreover, people barely have enough to eat, and you still want them to learn sculpting and oil painting? Clearly, you are slaves to a lost country. Even after the country is lost, you will still paint oil paintings? Still build museums?"</p>
<p>Another argument: "This is fundamentally a pastime for the bourgeoisie after eating Western food and smoking cigars. These bourgeois-smelling wastes, oil paintings! Sculptures! We inevitably and fundamentally despise them, so they are doomed to decline and inevitably will. We stand at the forefront of the world's cultural struggle and dare to say we don't want art, let alone the tiny, insignificant museums attached to it."</p>
<p>Another argument: "If the country really has some spare money, it might as well build several large Peking opera theaters or a few cinemas. This can both enlighten the people and increase revenue. Who wants to see some broken, dilapidated antiques coldly placed in a temple-like building? Therefore, I strongly advocate building theaters."</p>
<p>However, we need museums. The reason? There is no such reason.</p>

<p>— Old White</p>
<p>Qi Jun was one of my closest friends five years ago. Meeting again in this cold city this year, we both felt immense joy. Although we were good friends, closer than any other, we each had our own thoughts, which were vastly different. Often, late at night or during our conversations, I felt that this was a regrettable aspect of our friendship. I remember Qi Jun often telling me five years ago, "A person's thoughts can never be captured. You and I are like this because I believe in my thoughts; I think my thoughts are meaningful. No matter how worthless or boring my thoughts are considered by others, I must persevere."</p>
<p>Something always separated us: thoughts.</p>
<p>Qi Jun was a master of wasting himself. His view of life was one of enjoyment. He once said, "People live in the world to seek happiness; I live in the world to enjoy happiness and well-being every day. I will not worry about anything..." But what did I think after hearing his words? Could I correct and turn his incorrect thoughts around? I sometimes used stimulating words to advise him, but he was never moved. He thought his wasteful life was a joyous and meaningful expression. He said he needed waste, he needed happiness to regulate his life. He even said he would always embrace hedonism; even when he died, he would still be enjoying himself.</p>
<p>We parted in Naples. Qi Jun, filled with joy, stood on the deck of the ship and said to me, "Bai, you should go back now! I will definitely write to you after I arrive in Cairo..." Qi Jun's words deeply stung me, and I couldn't help but shed tears! But my tears were not for my attachment to Qi Jun; I was lamenting for Qi Jun, lamenting Qi Jun's youth, and even more so for many people like Qi Jun who waste their youth.</p>
<p>Qi Jun went to Cairo this time for no particular reason. He was going to play; to waste his precious youth in enjoyment. Since Qi Jun left me, his image has often been in my mind. Every night, I would think of him, and I would also think of many wasters.</p>
<p>This year, we met again in this place.</p>
<p>Qi Jun came to me almost every day, but his idea of enjoyment had not changed in the slightest.</p>
<p>In this lonely city, especially since I lived alone in this small house, and the landlady was not very talkative, I needed friends to come; because their presence could alleviate some of my melancholy.</p>
<p>Students and people working in factories came to me. They usually came at night, even in the deeper, quieter hours. So, during the day, I couldn't avoid loneliness, even though I was still studying at school. Now it was good; Qi Jun had finally reappeared in this place. The loneliness I felt during the day was gone.</p>
<p>Because it was spring, the air outside was very fresh. Qi Jun dragged me to the Duillier River for a leisurely stroll. The river water rippled with silver waves, reflecting the deep green coconut trees, almost turning into a beautiful picture. We sat under this coconut tree and talked about what had happened since we parted.</p>
<p>"Qi, you should have changed your thinking by now?" I said, patting Qi Jun's shoulder, but he did not answer me. He smiled and shook his head, indicating that his thinking had not changed.</p>
<p>"So... your thinking will never change?"</p>
<p>"Hmm..." Qi Jun said suddenly, as if remembering something. "Didn't you say that a person's thinking will never change?"</p>
<p>"Yes..." I said frankly. "Although that's true, I think your thinking, your decadent thinking, should change; you need to know that only a just and truthful thought is worthy of cherishing! Qi, are your thoughts just and truthful?"</p>
<p>Qi Jun did not speak; he was still smiling. A strange feeling occupied my heart. I thought of Qi Jun's youth, and I also thought of the youth of many wasters like Qi Jun. I was at a loss, and an immense sadness occupied me.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Qi Jun stood up. He yawned and began to walk back and forth on the grass. Qi Jun's shiny leather shoes rubbed against the grass, making a proud, strange sound. I dared not look at Qi Jun's face, because if I saw his face, I would think of a person's life, of a person's youth. Although Qi Jun had not worried or grieved in recent years, a few deep wrinkles had been drawn on his forehead. I felt that it was a pity for a person to grow old slowly in enjoyment and waste; why doesn't a person do what he should do? Why does a young person waste his youth in enjoyment? ...The flames of depression were burning in my heart. I stared blankly at Qi Jun's pair of shoes, brighter than mirrors, beneath the long flannel trousers, walking back and forth on the grass... It was like I was having a dream, a painful dream.</p>
<h3 id="e300">Flowers That Don't Bloom <a href="#e300" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c300" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">300</a></h3>
<p>— Yingzi</p>
<p>The person who plants flowers that don't bloom is lonely.</p>
<p>However, the expectation of flowers blooming is more meaningful than looking at a tree full of blossoms. Rather than watching flowers bloom and fall, it's better not to have flowers bloom at all. I love the graceful, lonely, empty courtyard and the flowers and trees that don't bloom.</p>
<p>Planting a few flowers occasionally is just learning to plant. There is no pretense of elegance, and there is not even a desire to see a flower bloom. Moreover, I truly feel an infinite emptiness about this – in terms of knowledge and experience in horticulture.</p>
<p>In my circumstances, I seem to be completely disconnected from leisurely things like planting flowers. Strange to say, I unexpectedly had a few months of leisure, but a person accustomed to panting in the rapid currents of life will find such long days boring!</p>
<p>So, I thought of planting some flowers.</p>
<p>Planting flowers is simply a way to dispel that sense of boredom and to spend these months of vague time on those flowers and trees that don't bloom. There is no other meaning. The two plain-colored monthly roses and one white rose were given to me two years ago as a favor by Zen Master Zhiguo. According to Mom, they haven't bloomed in two years and haven't been fertilized in two years. I didn't expect them to still be alive when I returned to my hometown, but they were much more haggard. (The responsibility of the owner!) So, I removed some messy branches and leaves for them, added some fresh soil, and placed them on the fish tank in the courtyard, which turned them into small focal points in this graceful, lonely, empty courtyard.</p>
<p>In addition, there was a white camellia that had just bloomed, a forsythia about to wither, and a wintersweet that had lost all its leaves and flowers. I bought them from the market for more than a dollar. I also turned them into potted plants and placed them in the courtyard with the monthly roses that hadn't bloomed in two years.</p>
<p>But they are all flowers without flowers:</p>
<p>Every morning, I carry a watering can to water them once. Then I move a deck chair next to the flowers, bathe in the spring sunshine, and read a book of Ming dynasty essays or poems that I love. Sometimes, the sound of the fish in the quiet fish tank being sprayed with water, or the "buzzing" of the bees emerging from under the leaves, would take my mind away. I would silently stand up and wander around the flowers for a while, lost in thought looking at the flower shadows of the tassels falling on the water surface and the fish playing under the flower shadows...</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the weather has turned cold again these past few days.</p>
<p>The white camellia that had just bloomed has been restrained by the cold and has not been able to bloom. The monthly roses and roses that haven't bloomed in two years also show no signs of blooming. Although the wintersweet has sprouted green shoots, it wants us to pin our hopes on winter.</p>
<p>No flowers, no flowers! Last night I listened to the rain all night, and when I got up and ran into the courtyard, I saw that the forsythia flowers that were about to wither had all fallen. Only a spider had spun a web under the flowers, catching a few fallen petals, as if trying to hold back this passing spring.</p>
<p>Spring is over. I was quite moved to travel.</p>
<h3 id="e301">Fire (5) <a href="#e301" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c301" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">301</a></h3>
<p>— Fei'er</p>
<p>Besides discussing my ten years of struggle, we also occasionally talked about the recent business conditions in Nanyang. In Nanyang, people must talk about business conditions; there is nothing else to talk about. Gradually, we talked about the local business situation, his own store, and my uncle's. When it came to that, my friend lowered his voice and said solemnly:</p>
<p>"Oh, Yisheng, I think your uncle's business is very dangerous! He certainly earned a lot in the past; he is very good at managing, but he sent most of his earnings back home. I heard that he built a large building in his hometown and bought some land, which is very good. Now, unfortunately, the 'recession' has come. At this moment, it is impossible to get goods without cash. Business at all levels is difficult; no one dares to lend on credit. So, because his coffers are empty, he is really suffering! He almost went bankrupt last year, but fortunately, he had the means to revive it. But the business has already been damaged at its root, and it is even more difficult to sustain under these precarious conditions. Although his store announces that it has made money every year, after actually investigating and researching, it lost at least ten thousand the year before last, and last year was even worse; I'm afraid it was more than twenty thousand? And last year's crisis, although covered up, the emptiness at the center is known to everyone. Businessmen, who doesn't keep their eyes open when doing business? Outwardly strong but inwardly weak will eventually reveal flaws in business, right? So I am always worried about him!"</p>
<p>These words caused me great surprise, as they were completely contrary to what my uncle said every day. And with the prosperity of the Junxing Company signboard ten years ago, it is truly unbelievable that this could be happening. Is it possible that a businessman with means like my uncle is helpless under the iron fist of this "recession"? However, Zhang's words can be trusted. Although they are business rivals, in friendship, what he says to me has always been honest and reliable. Regarding my uncle's building, I visited it when I went home on summer vacation the year before last; I heard it cost fifty or sixty thousand silver dollars to build. So, in any case, this is true. And now, based on my uncle's thin physique and the serious complexion I saw today, this is the best ironclad proof. And today, when I walked through the warehouse, there were very few goods sparsely placed inside. Ten years ago, it was piled full, and we had to rent a native's house to help store them. So, based on these events, the seriousness of the situation is truly worrying. In the midst of it, I exclaimed: "Oh! What to do?"</p>
<p>"But, my friend," my friend said slowly, gently, "Perhaps he has thought of plans that others have not thought of? He was able to turn around last year's crisis; can't he come up with brilliant ideas again now? Previously, he insured the store and goods for one hundred thousand guilders of fire insurance. In these times when cash is very tight, he doesn't even consider the immediate needs, but pays a significant insurance premium, hoping for future safety. This event is truly suspicious! People say that this fox's brilliant plan has arrived!"</p>
<p>I listened in silence, quietly thinking about the reason for this. At this time, it was already dark, and the coconut trees showed their black, huge bodies, standing majestically in this primitive world's night. After a while, the sky was covered with dark clouds, as if it was about to rain. Suddenly, the wind blew again, and I said:</p>
<p>"Let's go back! I'm afraid it will rain!"</p>
<p>"If the wind blows, there won't be any rain. However, it's too dark. Let's go back to the store to sit and talk. I'm afraid they have already come and are waiting for us."</p>

<h3 id="e302">Why Bother Going to University? <a href="#e302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>
<p>— Mingtang</p>
<p>Recently, George Bernard Shaw had an article called "Why Bother Going to University?" (see translated text in International Translation Report). This topic is very strange. Its content is that modern universities cannot teach people practical knowledge. They can only teach people false knowledge. They can only "first empty your mind, and then fill it with false thoughts" (Shaw's words). Therefore, he opposes universities and modern universities. He wants "all the universities in the world to be razed to the ground and disappear forever" (ibid.). He tells students to throw away all the textbooks in school, because these textbooks are useless and can only harm people. Then you should "sift through the sand to find gold" in a lot of practical knowledge, as if looking for what you want to learn. These things are the real knowledge you want to learn (all Shaw's words).</p>
<p>Why does Shaw so strongly oppose modern universities? He has his reasons. His reason is: "Not long ago, world civilization was almost destroyed by a terrible war. This war was constituted by people with university degrees. There are two truly dangerous people in the world, one is the half-educated, who have destroyed most of civilization; the other is the all-wise and all-powerful intellectual class, who have almost destroyed the entire world. Therefore, he said, "I believe that to preserve a civilization, we need people with some primitive spirit. But the people created by universities mostly have false intelligence." So he had to strongly oppose universities, modern universities. Moreover, he "predicted" that "the collapse of modern civilization is imminent, and the so-called dark age will return to this land." What a painful critique.</p>
<p>However, criticism is just criticism after all. Shaw is just a writer with a great satirical ability. Here, he cannot expose where the fundamental weakness of modern universities lies. Of course, under his pen, his article should be written like this. However, to more thoroughly explain the meaning of this article, we cannot help but give it considerable supplementation. Furthermore, he said that now I need people with some "primitive spirit", which is also wrong. The reason why things are bad is not in whether people are primitive or not, but in the change of the system. Did Shaw clearly point it out? No. Obviously, Shaw is just a satirical writer, just a Fabian liberal, a humanitarian. He does not have a clear understanding of reality.</p>
<p>What is the fundamental reason why modern universities are bad? Shaw only pointed out how bad modern universities are, and we must further point out why they are bad, and then eliminate this badness, which is the right thing to do.</p>
<p>The problem is not whether knowledge is true or false, or whether human emotions are primitive or not, but that the old era has been corrupted and destroyed. We do not ask for primitive spirit, we want to renew the spirit of an era; we do not want to "eliminate" universities, we want a university of another new era; we do not deny education, we want a new education that surpasses the current era.</p>

<p>— She</p>
<p>She squeezed out of the dilapidated countryside and was brought to Shanghai, this "gold digging nest," by her father, and thrown into a living hell-like factory. Along with a large group of wage slaves, she toiled daily under the gears of machinery, earning three or two mao a day, maintaining the livelihood of her family of four.</p>
<p>Her father was an idler, running around since he was little, and he is still like that now. He hangs out with a bunch of layabout friends all day, not doing anything right, and loves to do anything, sometimes causing big trouble, making the whole family uneasy. He rarely worried about the survival of his wife and children. Once, when she got two fingers crushed by the gears, he didn't even care, only blaming her for being careless and breaking a man's lifeline for no reason. This is an excellent example. She is now fourteen years old since she started working at ten.</p>
<p>She is a genuine country girl, but living in the urban environment for a long time has inevitably rubbed off on her some trendy airs. A cloth cheongsam, always kept clean, fits her slender and lively figure. Combined with a full, round face and quiet, delicate manner, she looks particularly innocent and virgin-like, making people feel somewhat elated.</p>
<p>But she is quite different. Although she is getting older, she still doesn't feel the need</p>

<p>Seeing in a certain newspaper yesterday that the Japanese envoy, Arita Akira, is now preparing to resolve our many pending cases with China one by one, he said, "Resolving a pending case is like lighting a candle." But I think the Japanese are truly formidable! Some time ago, there was some kind of "water bird diplomacy," and now there is this kind of "candle-lighting diplomacy." They are treating China like a candle to be lit. A bunch of unemployed Shanghai ruffians call swindling foreigners "lighting a candle." Now, it seems the Japanese also regard the Chinese as candles, so they say "lighting a candle."</p>
<p>Our 400 million compatriots are all going to become candle attendants!</p>

<p>— Yafei</p>
<p>That cruel environment! It actually destroyed my friend and took him away!</p>
<p>This is something worth grieving over. Yesterday, I suddenly received a very unfortunate and heartbreaking report from another friend, Zu. He said, "Yun! Do you know? Ruben has already passed away! This news came from one of his relatives this morning. How tragic is that!"</p>
<p>"Ruben has passed away"! When these words pierced my eardrums, how heartbroken I was! He was not only my good friend but also my only confidant in life. He was currently a revolutionary youth with ambition and new ideas. Alas! Why do good people often not live long? The heartlessness of the azure heavens is truly hateful. At that time, my hands were trembling, shaking as if sifting chaff. One hand gripped the telephone receiver, unable to utter even half a sentence. A cold draft penetrated from my back, through my spine, and into my lungs. Two teardrops fell patteringly, hanging from my cheeks onto my chest. I wished I could rush to see him one last time, but he was far away in Shaoxing, and I certainly couldn't sprout wings and fly over the Qiantang River. I could only shed tears and grieve here!</p>
<p>Ruben, my friend! Please forgive me! We have been together for several years, truly like siblings, but I never expected that now, even seeing you one last time is impossible. Forgive me! I remember saying to you in the past, "Let us share happiness and hardships together, using our two pure hearts, using our two sacred souls, to fight against the environment, to struggle with society, to open up our bright future, to create our new life!" Now, all of this has become a dream. You have left this filthy world and gone to another silent and invisible, pure world. "A coffin encloses the body, and all matters cease!" But of course, my tiny soul has already followed after you; however, my half-stiff body has not yet transformed, it still exists.</p>
<p>Indeed, you previously expressed to me your dissatisfaction with real life and your longing for the illusion of life's annihilation – death. Isn't that so? I also comforted you like this: "In the world, no one will have complete joy. Annihilation, life will eventually come to this one day, but it is only a matter of sooner or later." Unexpectedly, you have now gone before me to practice my words, and you have actually experienced life's annihilation! You are ultimately a brave and extraordinary person. I only have admiration and shame for you!</p>
<p>But I cannot be like this, I definitely cannot be like you; because I have not forgotten the mission that the times have given me! Although the heavy pressure of life refuses to let me go for even a moment, I cannot therefore abandon the responsibilities that life requires.</p>
<p>Do you remember? In the autumn of the year before last, autumn is a touching season. At this time, I was still with you. I casually, no, habitually, talked about my background, and became aware of the current pain. Moreover, at that time, I suffered a major blow, so I was so angry that fire almost came out of my eyes. But, finally, I vomited several mouthfuls of fresh blood because of this. However, I became resolutely aware from then on. From then on, I am not passive, nor do I resent, but I try hard to build the foundation of my life. For three years, although I am still the same, my will has been tempered much more resilient than before. On a dusk intertwined with bleak winds and bitter rain, my body was lying on a hospital bed. Thank you for your kindness, not minding the long journey from Hangzhou to visit me. I am of course very grateful to you, but my heart was indeed extremely painful at that time; I could only mechanically stare at you with two lifeless eyes, without saying anything to you. The reason is that I really couldn't say anything, and I didn't want to say anything to make you sad!</p>
<p>Ruben, my friend! We have known each other for several years, and there has never been any disagreement between us. Although there were sometimes some small misunderstandings, everyone was very understanding, so there was never any deeper quarrel.</p>
<p>This, I should blame you for. Your personality is too stubborn, too unyielding. You fell ill in the autumn of last year, and I advised you to seek medical treatment, but you valued money too much. "If you have money, start with money; if you don't have money, start with your body" is true, you don't have a lot of money, but you have to think of a way! Your illness deepened day by day, and I think it was ultimately not worth it!</p>
<p>Since you went to bed, Zu and I have come to visit you many times. You were sometimes good and sometimes bad, which really worried me. Later, my younger brother, Xiongfei, was falsely imprisoned on January 6th, so I suffered another major blow; I was bedridden for half a month. A few days later, when I came to see you, I didn't expect that you had already been taken away by that Shanghai-Hangzhou train, so I had to return disappointed. After you arrived in the countryside, although I sent you many letters, I didn't receive even one reply.</p>
<p>Now, I suddenly received such an unfortunate message. Alas! Ruben, my friend! Have you carelessly abandoned your friend of many years who was hard to separate from? Ah!</p>
<p>The world is impermanent, leaving only a dusty bed,</p>
<p>Where to find your appearance and voice, sadly gazing at the lute and person.</p>

<p>— Ben</p>
<p>Because I had insomnia the night before, I couldn't muster any energy when I got up early, and my head was dizzy. But for the sake of my job, no, let's put it bluntly, for the sake of "food" to eat, I had to force myself to work. I barely managed to get through three hours until it was time for lunch. After eating, I ran back to the dormitory. It was really a struggle to get my legs and arms up the stairs. Without even wiping my face, and not even thinking about my "not yet quit" smoking addiction, I fell backward onto the bed and fell asleep in less than a minute. However, I didn't sleep peacefully, because it was already twenty minutes past twelve when I went to bed, and I had something to do at one o'clock.</p>
<p>When one o'clock struck, Mr. ×, my roommate, seemed to have called me before going downstairs. I also seemed to have responded in my dream, "I'll get up right away." My body suddenly turned to the side, the clock struck with a clang, and I woke up with a jolt.</p>
<p>At this time, I remembered my great treasure – the fur coat. Because it was a great treasure, I cherished it exceptionally. After taking it off, I would wrap it up carefully. When summer approached, I was even more afraid of insect damage and mildew, so I would take it out and hang it in the sun whenever the sun was in the sky.</p>
<p>On this day, I had hung it on the bamboo pole in front of the window about an hour before my afternoon nap. I knew the wind was blowing quite hard, so I had firmly tied the bamboo pole to the leg of the table inside the room with a rope. That way, I should have been able to rest assured. Moreover, even though I was so sleepy in the afternoon, when I entered the room, I took a look at it, and it was there. Mr. × seemed to have said to me before going downstairs, "The fur coat can be taken in, the wind is blowing too hard."</p>
<p>In this short period of less than ten minutes, my fur coat fell downstairs, and with one fall, it became a theft case.</p>
<p>I was extremely surprised, surprised at the boldness of the theft, probably as big as a "lantern."</p>
<p>When I rolled out of bed, wiped my eyes, and walked to the window, ah! The fur coat was gone! I quickly looked down out the window, but I didn't see it lying on the ground either. I was anxious, so anxious that I ran downstairs and found Mr. ×. Mr. × said that when he went downstairs, my fur coat was clearly there. So I ran to the courtyard facing the windowsill, asking this person, who said he hadn't seen it, and asking that person, who didn't know either.</p>
<p>In this short period of less than ten minutes, the theft of my fur coat was confirmed.</p>
<p>The second floor is the student dormitory, the lower floor is the housing for the school workers, and in front is a school-run stove for boiling water. Usually, when I look out the window at this narrow and desolate courtyard, there are no outsiders. Not a single student ever comes here, and the only people are the workers at the stove shuttling back and forth, the maids washing and drying clothes here, and sometimes one or two other school workers hanging around in a shady way. However, when I went to question these responsible and suspicious personnel, they all denied it outright. Because I am a teacher and they are school workers, I couldn't bear to use some kind of threatening tactic, and others would not sympathize. My fur coat was lost just like that. There was nothing I could do. But how anxious I was!</p>
<p>A coat made of dozens of old foreign dollars was my only property. I had only worn it for two seasons, and it was still half new. I had long had this plan to put a new lining on it in the autumn, so that I could show it off to my friends in the winter. What a good fur coat!</p>
<p>Alas, for the past few days, I have been recalling the purchase of this fur coat, which was the result of so much sweat and effort. Now that it is lost, how terrifying will the winter be, making me unable to rest for a moment. Alas, misfortune in a poor family, suffering this theft, besides swallowing tears, I also have to put my hands together and recite "Amitabha."</p>
<h3 id="e308">Thunder <a href="#e308" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c308" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">308</a></h3>
<p>— Luojia</p>
<p>Thunder symbolizes the beginning of a new era. In the scorching summer, not a single cloud can be found in the sky, and the scorching sun radiates thousands of streams of heat. The lush green leaves curl up one by one, appearing very tired. The tiles of people's houses are so dry that they are about to crack, just like a traveler in the desert who desperately needs a sip of cool, clear water. Wild dogs drag their tails, stick out their tongues, and pant in the shade of the wall. People are even more anxious to jump into a pool of clear water to feel comfortable. Everyone's heart is filled with the fear of being scorched to death.</p>
<p>Suddenly, in this unbearable heat, a deafening thunderclap suddenly came in the sky. In an instant, clouds gathered one by one, forming a dark mass, and rain as big as fists, like the Yellow River bursting its banks, poured down on every piece of scorched earth. Flashing lightning and booming thunder played together a piece of the world's most perfect music of power.</p>
<p>After a while, the rain stopped, and the thunder also stopped. The sky was blue, and the earth was moist. The unbearable heat that had been forcing people to death before had been eliminated by the great thunder. Therefore, people's hearts felt an unspeakable comfort and joy, just like coming out of a dark and suffocating cave into a field of fresh air. At this time, everyone thought that they had entered another world suitable for survival, without the fierce flames of the scorching sun, the suffocating air, and the stinging mosquitoes and flies.</p>
<p>Now, we are in this scorching environment.</p>
