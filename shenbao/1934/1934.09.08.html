<p>國聯行政院開會</p>
<p>蘇俄入盟爲討論中心</p>
<p>法外長努力淸除荆棘</p>
<p>理事一席我連任有望</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　國聯行政院今日開秋季會議、以捷克外長皮恩士爲主席、其所討論之主要事件、爲蘇俄加入國聯之聲請、雖阿眞廷與瑞士目前反對俄國入會、但衆料因談判之結果、行政院可一致投票贊成、同時現正努力欲避免下星期國聯大會開會時之直接投票、蓋希望阿眞廷與瑞士放棄投票權、而向行政院表示其不同意也、國聯方面希望日本因蘇俄之入會、重行考慮其退出國聯之主張、因蘇俄入會後、其各種國際問題之談判、將大爲堅强、尤以與遠東有關係者爲甚也、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　國聯改選行政院理事、巳定於本月十七日舉行、我國代表團今日向國聯秘書處正式提出爲非常任理事候選者之請求（七日中央社電）</p>
<p>（南京）　外交界息、國聯十五屆大會定十日舉行、我出席代表除郭泰祺日前巳抵日内瓦外、金問泗羅忠詒亦到、（七日中央社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　中國連任國聯非常任理事之機會、今日益見增加、因波斯業巳撤回要求、而土耳其或可用妥恊方法使之放棄、中國之要求連任、今日巳由駐英公使兼國聯大會首席代表郭泰祺氏正式宣布、波斯繼卽聲明撤回要求、惟表示係向土耳其退讓、至土耳其則巳於昨日正式向國聯秘書處提出候選通知、惟波斯雖然有此表示、實際上中國之地位較爲有利、今晚據國聯消息靈通方面所傳、土耳其之要求亦將撤回、因土耳其代表魯希悌氏巳被推爲本屆大會主席、當可不必再有所爭矣、（六日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　土耳其現獲有力之贊助、與中國競爭國聯行政院理事席、中國友人之願中國重行獲選而得連任者、現甚焦灼、中土兩國如相奮鬥、則中國易獲多數選票、此實無甚可疑者、第中國在提出其被選資格之前、尙須經國聯大會三分之二之多數贊同其續有此資格而後可、土耳其旣立於反對地位、其運動三分之一之反對中國票、當非大難事、所慮者卽在此也、如中國在國聯大會中獲有重被選舉之資格、則在選舉行政院理事時、定可獲多數票被選連任、但中國如失其資格、則土耳其大有獲選之望、（六日路透電）</p>
<p>蘇俄加盟問題</p>
<p>開始會外接洽</p>
<p>英捷與法步調一致</p>
<p>縱有反對不成問題</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　法國外長巴爾都行抵日内瓦後、立卽與各國首席代表開始會商、談話大都係關於蘇聯加入國聯會之問題、最初與巴爾都會晤者、爲英國掌璽大臣艾登、捷克外長貝奈斯繼之、艾登與貝奈斯不僅對於蘇聯加入國聯、與法國完全同意、卽對於東歐中歐互助公約問題、亦意見一致、午刻由國聯秘書長愛文諾設宴、爲與會各國主要首席代表洗塵、宴畢巴爾都首晤波蘭外長柏克、繼晤阿根廷代表剛狄洛、就大體推測、蘇聯加入國聯會雖有瑞士等國提出反對、然在國聯大會内獲得三分之二之多數通過、當非十分困難、惟與俄國以行政院常作理事一席、則較爲棘手、至波蘭反對蘇聯加入國聯會之說、係屬不確、波蘭所要求者、乃由半常任理事之地位、改爲常任理事、惟當國際聯盟會最初創立時、本已預定以常任事事一席畀與俄國、以此而論、蘇聯突有一種優先權利、實則波蘭所力爭者、係爲保護少數民族問題、職是之故、本日午後巴爾都與柏克會晤、極關重要、此外一般人以爲阿根廷對於蘇聯加入國聯涉於游移、故巴爾都與剛狄洛之會晤、其關係亦頗重要也、又本屆國聯大會應由何人主席之問題、現尙懸而未决、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　據每日民聲報外交記者稱、阿根廷對於蘇俄加入國聯會、不致反對、但又謂、「此層未可遽下斷語、天下事往往有出人意外者、例如一九二六年德國入盟之時、巴西代表梅落佛郎哥、藉口德國入盟、則行政院常任會員席將爲歐洲各大國所壟斷、故出而反對、下星期内國聯大會討論蘇俄加入問題時、容或有同樣驚人事件發生、亦未料」云云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>行政院會議</p>
<p>通過鴉片報告</p>
<p>玻巴爭端移大會解决</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　國聯行政院會議於本日上午開幕、當經舉行公開及非公開會議各一次、但除出席各國要人互相欵洽外、均無關重要、行政院常任理德國日本兩座位、並未取消、惟均虚設、本日會議中所提出各項次要性質之報告、如鴉片委員會報告等、均未加討論卽行通過、惟墨西哥代表拿傑拉提出關於玻利維亞巴拉圭兩國爭端之報告、主張依照國聯盟約第十五條、將此項爭端正式移交國聯大會、以謀解决、其時玻巴兩當事國代表均發表意見、蓋玻巴兩國雖非行政院理事、然依照慣例、與所討論事件有關之會員會、亦得被邀請出席行政院會議也、玻利維亞代表發言、對於國聯逾越盟約所定之程序、禁止運輸軍火至交戰國、是否合法、仍行提出保留、巴拉圭代表則謂盟約第十五條規定會員國、間發生足以决裂之爭議時、方提交行政院或大會、今玻巴兩國實際上及法理上、均已形成戰爭狀態、是否尙可適用第十五條之規定、亦應提出保留云、行政院最後依照拿傑拉之提議、决定援引盟約第十五條、將玻巴兩國爭端、移交國聯大會云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　鴉片顧問委員會之報告書、今日巳爲國聯行政會所通過、該報告書請國聯注意於中國現有關於雅片非法貿易之可驚的情勢、並表示中政府採行各種步驟、以肅淸涸毒之願望、該報告書主張凡在中國享有領判權之政府、應將查明參加此種非常貿易之人民逐出中國境外、而對於懸掛外旗行於内河之船隻運銷雅片者、應不復予以保護、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>理事之競選</p>
<p>拉丁美洲智利當選有望</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　國聯會之非常任理事、本屆任斯屆滿者有中國·西班牙·與巴拿馬三國、各方對於繼任選舉、業已開始競爭、土耳其提出候選資格、波斯代表通知國聯會秘書長謂波斯原提候選資格、現願撤回以讓土耳其、中國雖巳三年任滿、但援波蘭及西班牙先例、要求連任、至於拉丁美洲在國聯會行政院向有三席、此次巴拿馬出缺、一般人以爲拉丁美洲各國代表、將以此席讓於智利、又南美各國代表團對蘇俄加入國聯會一事、亦將公同討論云、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>各國政治家</p>
<p>紛集日内瓦</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　法外長巴爾都今晨八時、偕國聯會法國代表團辦事處主任馬西格里抵此、英國掌璽大臣艾登爵士、與波蘭外交部長柏克上校亦均到達（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　南愛自由邦行政院長凡勒拉、與艾登同來、但定於明日首途往日内瓦、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　紐絲綸駐英特派員派爾爵士、本日由此間啟程往日内瓦、代表紐絲綸出席國聯大會、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>土京　外長魯舒第本日啟程、取道意大利威尼斯港前往日内瓦、出席國聯大會、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>立陶宛京城　外交部長羅索賴蒂斯、今日啟程往日内瓦參加國聯大會、瀕行時向埃爾達通訊社發表宣言、謂最近波羅的海沿岸三國（卽立陶宛·拉達維亞·及愛斯多尼亞）在里加會議、結果草簽恊商公約、對於東歐和平之鞏固、關係極爲重要、至於法俄兩國所發起之東歐互助公約、則立陶宛基於簽約國家一律平等之原則、將竭誠合作、以求其成云云、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>薩爾問題</p>
<p>德宣明態度</p>
<p>視法國備忘錄僅屬研究性質</p>
<p>國聯是否有權處理尙爲疑問</p>
<p>（柏林）　自法國政府向國聯提出薩爾問題備忘錄後、德國政府之態度亦巳漸在確定之中、今日德國半官式機關外交政治評論、對此問題巳有論文發表、頗可作爲德國政府態度之一種預示、在德國官塲方面認法國所提出諸問題、在目前祗可視爲屬於研究性質、因在投票表决之結果未得悉之前、諸問題固尙不存在也、故在德國方面觀之、國聯方面亦未必在此時期肯將此種重要而難以處决之爭辯問題、預先加以討論、且國聯在討論諸問題之前、尙有先决問題、勢須先行定奪、卽按諸凡爾賽和約、國聯是否有處理薩爾問題之權、法國備忘錄中所惴惴不安者、卽將來投票表决之結果、竟使薩爾復歸併於德國是也、至於薩爾煤區之由德國備價贖回一節、法國方面亦頗爲疑慮、</p>
<p>惟德人以爲凡爾賽條約中、並無煤區之主權一日不能解决、則薩爾之復歸德國將有一日遲延之規定也、德人認法國備忘錄中之各種讓步、而期薩爾人民之投票能贊成維持現狀、實屬空想、倘謂薩爾區歸併於法國、則人民之德國性情言語文化等等將不受干涉云云、尤屬毫無意義、因薩爾歸併於法國之可能性、可云等於零也、此外法國所表示對於薩爾區歸併於德國之種種疑慮、亦屬無需、因任何民族、惟有其父母之邦能爲顧及其利益也、（六日國民電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>我國競爭國聯行政院理事</h3>
<p>廷</p>
<p>九一八之變甫起。中國朝野多屬望於國聯。而東北四省。迄未恢復。於是咀咒之聲。囂然雜作。以爲國聯之爲物。徒仰少數强者之鼻息。初無補於時艱。然平心而論。國聯仍不失爲一主張正義之組織。有此組織。寗不勝於往日之國際無政府狀態。美前總統威爾遜嘗曰。世界不當有均勢。而須有共勢。此其理想。惟國聯主義差足孕育。而自十九世紀後半期以來。自由競爭之學說。亦已爲羣性共濟之思想所籠罩。若斯思想。表現於國際組織者。又莫過於國聯。中國本此信念。乃絶不因國聯實力之孱弱。而遽變易其擁護之初衷。</p>
<p>夫以中國幅圓之廣漢。人口之繁多。國際地位之重要。贊助國聯之堅决。出任國聯首腦之一員。實屬名正而言順。按照國聯組織法。行政院實爲其權力重心之所歸。則中國此次競爭聯任行政院非常任理事。更見其當仁不讓之精神。與夫重視國聯之至意。今日世界各國。因國聯主義而犧牲者。當以中國爲最。而一九三三年二月間國聯正式宣布利於中國之判詞。則猶待兌現。足見中國之於國聯。權利義務。逈不相侔。中國毫無負於國聯。而國聯實有負於中國。中國最後之日的無他。乃欲以一理事國之地位。繼續努力。俾國聯得早日完成此筆未了之義務。以重振其將墮之威信。明乎此。則知眞正愛護國聯者。必將有以成全中國競爭非常任事事之宏願也。</p>
<p>是屆行政院非常任理事之滿期者。有中國西班牙僣巴拿馬國。而與中國相競爭者。則有波斯與土耳其。繼而波斯撤銷其候選權。以求有利於土。而土國代表之競選宣言。則競謂。「土耳其現希望之理事席。以前爲中國所佔。…土耳其固爲歐洲國家。……但按洲分配理事席一層。乃默認之慣例。國聯會盟約。並無規定。故實際上並無法律根據。」不知國聯大會。固早有一希望案之通過。謂「選舉行政院非常任事事。大會之抉擇。宜設法頋全各種地域的種族的。宗敎的。主要分團之代表權。」而大會表示。亞洲應在行政院上有充分之代表者。復屢不一見。然則地跨歐亞之土耳其。固鮮與我競爭之理由也。　　曩者。國聯事業之範圍。往往限於歐陸一隅。而行政院與秘書處之大權。又爲歐洲列强所獨攬。至使關係全球之國聯。寖寖有歐洲化之勢。世人以此爲國聯詬病者。實繁有徒。吾人深覺行政院之理事。亟有擴充之必要因亦贊成若波斯與暹羅等亞洲國家之參加。特他人欲取我位而代之。則不能不與力爭耳。</p>
<p>吾人滋願寄語土國當局。貴國誠欲得行政院之一席。曷勿參照盟約第四條第五項之規定。力謀大會多數出席國之同意。以期增加非常任理事之名額。查最初非常任理事。不過四席。一九二二年第三屆大會時。决定增加兩席。一九二六年第七屆大會時。又自六席增至九席。同時。常任理事。亦自五席加至六席。今蘇聯之當選爲常任事事。巳有極大之把握。大槪經本月十日大會多數之通過、卽可入盟而參加現方舉行之行政院會議。往例。常任理事數加多。則非常任理事。亦將相當有所增益。此舉而果實現。則中國與土耳其二國固同有當選之望。是以兩國當局應速爲共同利害努力。鼓吹行政院組織之擴大也。一說。土耳其所希望者。實在得一大會之主席。此而如願。亦將自動放棄候選權。然則我國之非常任理事席。固大有蟬聯之望。可不再進一步以求常任理事之當選耶。</p>

<p>（東京）　日本政府對於海軍軍縮會議之根本方針及應付預備會商之訓令案巳經今日閣議正式决定、其根本方針如次、</p>
<p>（一）日本對於軍縮會議提出澈底軍縮案、脫離華府倫敦兩種不平等條約、廢除攻擊武器、設定自主保有量、以確立軍備平等之權、造成國防安全、减輕國民負担除去戰爭威脅之三大目的、</p>

<p>（六）如會議承認上項提案、則日本可接收任何種類之軍縮案、上項訓令案交九月十六日出發赴英之隨員主席山本少將携往、（七日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）　今日定例閣議終了後、大角海相謂、今日之閣議較平日緊張、因其爲决定重大國務、屢經熱心質疑、反覆應答、而帝國對於軍縮之確固不動原則遂由此産生、今後則僅辦理事務、故不成問題、至於今日閣議之内容、相約一切不言、然昨今兩日、岡田首相曾進宮詳奏、故帝國之該根本方針、設有若何事態發生、亦可謂毫不變更者也、（七日電通電）</p>

<p>歐洲陣勢轉變</p>
<p>意法携手對德</p>
<p>同意訂立政治軍事恊約</p>
<p>空談軍縮無裨歐陸和平</p>
<p>羅馬　據美聯社今日自可靠方面所得消息、意法兩國在原則上巳同意訂立一種政治及軍事恊約、該項條約將使歐洲列强之陣勢完全改變、而向來空洞難决之軍縮理論、將代以一種維持大陸和平之現實的迭克推多制度、聞兩國諒解之範圍甚廣、根本上包括下列各點、</p>
<p>（海軍平等、（二）軍備平等、（三）合力拒絶德國重整軍備、（四）政治合作及恊商</p>
<p>據意法兩國政治家現在之計劃、小恊約各國亦將包括在此條約以内、若然、則歐洲大陸將有常備軍一百五十萬人合力維持和平、美聯社自可靠方面得悉、法國外長巴爾都本月底羅馬之行、卽爲該約成立之時、該約成立後、歐洲之和平問題將一變以前之形勢、此間觀察者以爲經年不决之軍縮問題、卽可完全不談、蓋兩國鑒於空談軍縮、益使各國備戰更甚、故不如採取現實政策也、並聞此項條約係因德奥兩國突生變亂、故羅馬巴黎之間進行外交談判、遂得此結果云、（六日國民電）</p>
<p>羅馬否認軍事同盟　羅馬今日午後此間官塲承認意法談話刻在進行中、但尙未成立恊定、並未有意法海陸同盟之問題云、聞意相墨索里尼與法大使項伯倫關於解决非常列比亞邊界案意人所不滿各點之談話、巳有良好進步、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>羅馬　駐意法使今日在此發出正式文告、切實否認法意兩國巳成立關於海軍平等軍備及反對德國重置武裝之恊定一說、意國官塲亦否認兩國巳締結此種恊定之消息、聞意法兩國現確籌備在法外長巴爾都十月底來游羅馬以前、對於若干懸案謀取完全妥恊、但不致成立與德國重置武裝事有關之任何恊定耳、（六日國民電）</p>
<p>巴黎認爲時機未熟　巴黎美聯社據確悉、羅馬所傳法意成立恊約之說尙屬過早、惟在外長巴爾都九月底赴意之時將加討論、以定確實辦法、則皆承認云、（六日國民電）</p>
<p>倫敦深切注意（倫敦）　法意恊定之說、巴黎與羅馬雖皆否認之、但歐洲各國執政者對之極爲注意、因此種諒解如果成立、則能形成歐洲極有勢力之政治團結也、據可恃方面預料、法外長巴爾都與意相墨索里尼將晤商對德之共同政策、及其對於海軍會議之態度、同時並將設法解决非州法屬地内意僑地位之難題、按法意兩國對於非洲殖民地事、本有惡感、而對於彼此海軍地位、亦復互相嫉忌、今則此種形勢業已大變、蓋巴爾都與墨索里尼了解國社黨對奥之企圖、有危及意國之潛能也、衆信法意海軍諒解、巳有一部份之成立、故法國得减少其駐於地中海之海軍力量、而將軍艦調至英吉利海峽如邵堡等口岸、現邵堡口岸已從事刷新、兩國恊定將來如果成立、則當然須通知捷克·南斯拉夫·與羅馬尼亞三小恊約國、以期銷釋政治上與經濟上之疑慮、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>日内瓦之觀察　（日内瓦）　國聯中外交家今日一致承認奥國事變、使德意關係惡化、大可促成意法兩國締結政治軍事條約、消息靈通方面尙傳英法兩國允許意國在阿比西尼亞自由行動、亦爲促使羅馬政府贊成此項計劃之原因、（六日國民電）</p>
<p>柏林並不驚異　（柏林）德國政治當局今日對於傳說中之法意妥恊最後宗旨如何、不願表示意見、某高級官員則稱、此項條約或將使各國接受意大利之國際軍縮計劃、或其他對於德國較前有利之提議、官塲方面對於意法兩國之突然接近、並不十分驚異、因自七月間奥國發生事變以來、德國深知早巳失去意國之贊助及同情矣、（六日國民電）</p>

<p>英國工會大會</p>
<p>决議放棄以總罷工爲反戰手段</p>
<p>不再與第三國際結成共同陣綫</p>
<p>（倫敦）　在威茅斯舉行之英國工會常年大會、本日討論和平與軍縮問題、英國工團主義派放棄以總罷工反對戰爭之方法、大會總報告書内有一節、謂「遇有戰爭之危險時、應召集特别大會、以便决定是否應由實業方面採取行動以應付之、」討論此節時、辯論甚爲激烈、主張極端主義之少數派認此辦法爲「軟化」、而報告書之起草人則陳述種種理由以解釋之、大多數會員均表贊同、故此節卒被通過、運輸工會首領伯文宣稱、「樞密大臣包爾温曾言英國當視萊因河爲國界、吾人則以爲關於國際問題英國無所謂國界、其唯一解决機構在日内瓦、」旋有數人發言、均認漏繫主義之獨裁制、含有戰爭危險、至是工會總書記西脫利伯發表演說、結束辯論、大爲會衆所注意、其言曰、「假如日本攻擊蘇俄、諸君其以爲國聯會之規律可以阻止日本乎、諸君其以爲各國均有决心、欲以維持和平之權畀於國聯會乎、以吾所見、如必欲在國際上維持和平、第一須有一種機關、遇國際爭執時確有解紛排難之能力、第二須有國際警察、使侵略之國有所畏忌、有此二者、庶可以言維持和平、」總書記之見解、於歡呼聲中由大衆舉手贊成、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　在威茅斯開會之英國工會常年大會、以全體缺二票之贊成、决定不再與共産黨結成公同陣綫、緣工會總書記西脫利納指摘共産黨、謂其存心旣不光明、而自若干年以來、又有種種破壞工會之企圖故也、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（華盛頓）　國務院今日宣布美俄債務交涉、巳經完全破裂、昨晚曾與蘇俄大使特洛耶拿夫斯基舉行秘密會議、其後卽宣告絶望、國務院稱、在實質方面美國巳讓步至於極點、若再退讓、則美國人民之公共利益將犧牲過甚云、查昨晚與俄使之會議、係謀復活上月業巳停頓之交涉、據俄人方面所傳、交涉困難之點係對於蘇俄　貨應享受何等信用、此點未能同意、而非蘇俄償還美國欵項之數目問題、惟據國務院所稱、實質方面之讓步云云、則若干觀察者以爲究竟賠償問題、亦不如蘇俄當局所稱之順利也、（六日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　美俄債務談判陷於僵局、其原因由於羅斯福總統對於蘇俄要求一萬萬元之長期借欵、巳明白拒絶、卽商務墊欵亦不允超過二萬萬元、羅斯福總統通知國務院云、歐洲各國欠美債欵、尙未償還者爲數已多、未便再以長期借欵給與任何國家云、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>除此以外、在歐洲還有一處潛伏着的火山、頗有爆發大禍的可能性、這座熄滅巳久的火山、就是新興的三小國、愛斯多尼亞·拉多維亞·立陶宛·三國、這三個國家、包含着三類少數民族、是大戰以後纔恢復的舊國、其國土總面積祗有六萬四千餘哩、人口總數不過五百三十六萬、愛斯多尼亞人口總數、祗一百十一萬九千人、其中愛斯多尼亞人占百分之八七·七、俄羅斯人占百分之八·二、德意志人占百分之一·八、拉多維亞國人口、總數爲一百九十萬、其中拉多人占百分之七三·四、俄羅斯人占百分之一二·六、猶太人占百分之五·二、德意志人占百分之三·八、波蘭人占百分之二·八、立陶宛人口約計二百三十四萬、其中立陶宛人占百分之八三·猶太人占百分之七、波蘭人占百分之四、德意志人占百分之一·五、由這樣看來、德人眞是少數民族中的少數民族了、然而這些德意志種人、是這個比較落後、而滯留在農業時代國家中的地主、大體上經濟實力都掌握在他們手中、所以在這三國當中有人給德意志地主以一種别號、呌做波羅的男爵、</p>
<p>在國際間風平浪靜的期間、這樣因素、還不免發生問題、何况現在正是多事而又尋事之秋、那得没有事故、德國旣不能立卽撕毁凡爾賽和約、又不能向中歐伸手、因爲他不能和法國和意大利立卽開戰、而國内不平又無處發洩、結果祇有另尋出路、這條出路、就是波羅的海三小國了、希特勒自己及其部下、都以爲波羅的海諸國、是「東歐的巴爾幹、」是Nazis的新地盤、</p>
<p>况且目前的形勢、德法對立、雖很激化、但德國要取消凡爾賽和約、要奪回阿爾薩斯·洛連或合併奥大利、都有所不能、卽薩爾投票、結果恐也没有充分把握、軍備平等、也是一句空話、那末祗有找另一的路綫、必不得已而拉攏波蘭、意在東向的出路、在理論上、資本主義和社會主義、是不兩立的、在事實上、德國自量其力、可以和蘇聯相比賽、在外交上或可得到英國的諒解、法意也不强硬反對、果眞能如此打開東進的路、則德國目前的困難、或能减少若干、經濟危機、亦或可轉變過來、</p>
<p>然而蘇聯也正不弱、他看見了波羅的海諸國、隱藏着禍機、所以就首先着手把三小國的不侵略條約、延長十年、同時又提議東歐羅加洛條約、并邀請德國波蘭加盟、而德國以眼前平安無事拒絶簽訂此約後、蘇聯卽盡量發揮其外交手腕、與多腦河流域的小恊約國、都復交了、對法關係、又確好轉、雖然德國有意東侵、而路途却塞著了、這種安全聯益－蘇聯與法蘭西所分佈的安全網、已近於完成、德國固然想要衝破牠、但帮助的人手太少、單獨一國的力量、也嫌薄弱、卽加上波蘭、還是不够、以故波羅的海三國、終是一個禍因、是德蘇將來發生重大問題的塲所、卽歐洲的新火藥庫、（八月四日於柏林）</p>

<p>松江田賦舞弊案</p>
<p>財廳審究情形</p>
<p>征收主任葉宗城侵呑十餘萬</p>
<p>押省訊問供認自願分期淸償</p>
<p>鎭江訊、松江征收主任葉宗城、浮收侵佔田賦稅欵十萬餘元之舞弊鉅案、經財廳發覺後、即電令該縣扣留、並一度拘押來省訊問、現仍押返該縣、記者向有關方面、探得該案實情、詳誌如後、</p>
<p>舞弊起因　松邑浦南浦北地方、有折田數萬畝、財廳爲顧恤民難起見、令酌量四六折納糧、後接該縣呈報、該地完全荒地、未能納賦等情到廳、故廳方亦未從嚴過問、詎該征收主任等、至十九年起即向該地糧戶十足征收、毫無折扣、對上峯則一成不報、結算迄今、不下十餘萬元、值此省府澄淸吏治之時、該主任竟舞如此鉅弊、亦可謂膽大妄爲矣、</p>
<p>事發經過　該案弊端旣如斯之鉅、當非一人所能包辦、内中難免發生糾紛、遂有人密控於財廳、趙廳長得此消息後、隨電飭該縣將該主任拘押來省、并一面派員調查屬實、以以該縣第二科長車釗、職司田賦、對此案事前毫無隻字呈報、其頇　職務可知、或竟有通同作弊情事、嫌疑實爲重大、已令縣將其軟禁、</p>
<p>承認侵呑　葉宗城押解來省後、嚴方即派員訊問、該犯將所控各節、一一承認、并堅决認爲完全係彼一人所爲、并無其他之人參加、願將所侵呑之欵分期完全吐出、十月底交出五萬、餘欵廢曆年底繳淸、財廳據供後、着該犯將欵限期交出、暫仍發回該縣看押、聞一面將仍派員赴該縣澈查、有無竄同作弊者、至該地賦稅、浦北業經查竣、約九萬元、浦南尙在淸查中、爲數無多、約萬餘元之譜、（六日）</p>

<p>孔祥熙發表重要談話</p>
<p>絶不禁止白銀出口</p>
<p>價值千萬銀條運川</p>
<p>劉湘已經打消辭意</p>
<p>中央社云、行政院副院長兼財政部部長孔祥熙氏、日前由廬返京、前晚十一時乘坐夜車離京來滬、昨晨八時許抵眞茹下車、換乘汽車逕返西愛咸斯路私邸休息、旋於上午十一時許、前往中央銀行辦公、午後五時許接見各報社記者、發表下列之談話、</p>
<p>絶不禁目白銀出口</p>
<p>據孔氏談、前者奸人造謠、或謂政府行將禁止白銀出口、或謂政府行將徵收白銀出口稅、以致人心惶惑、大量白銀狂流出口、實則政府對於白銀出口、絶無禁止之意、更無征收白銀出口稅之事、目前一般人對於此事、眞相巳明、白銀出口之數量大减、預料不久仍裝運回中國、孔氏且謂、金融如人身之血液、輸出輸入、當聽其自然、平時不可採取斷然辦法、自損信譽、惟在緊急之時、則不在此例、現銀之存滬、不及五萬萬、而在國人自營之銀行者占二萬九千萬元左右、所以深盼國人對白銀外輸問題、勿過於惶惶、</p>
<p>廢除苛雜成績斐然</p>
<p>孔氏續談、自財政部於七月一日起、厲行廢除全國苛捐雜稅以來、成績斐然、而各地人民担負之輕减不少、至於苛捐雜稅廢除後、各省財政補救問題、此實無庸顧慮、蓋各省市苛捐雜稅之增加、本係不當、例如某省府建一極華麗之房屋、需資百萬、因省庫無欵、則而增加苛捐雜稅、此種不應當之增加人民担負、固可廢除、故各省苛捐雜稅廢除後、財政收支上决無問題、</p>
<p>糧食運銷局即成立</p>
<p>關於財政部糧食運銷局之籌辦、迭與各界接洽、不日卽可成立、目下進行現狀、巳分頭調查各地糧食産量及需要多寡、及糧食之購辦成立後、視各地災情而施銷運、運銷方面、將會同鐡道交通等部合辦、至於信託局之籌組、已委葉琢堂爲局長、該局營業範圍爲經營儲蓄保險等信託事業、惟與普通之信託機關少異、至於銀行儲蓄法之修改問題、本人爲體卹商艱起見、已提交行政院討論、惟該法係立法院草擬、而經中央核准頒佈、將來是否可修改、則尙待討論云</p>
<p>劉湘辭意已經打銷</p>
<p>四川勦匪總司令劉湘氏、前曾呈請中央辭職、現經中央去電挽留、辭意業已打銷、仍負四川軍政之責、川省當局、前以内地存銀大量向都市流出、農村經濟凋疲、故請求中央撥付價值千萬之銀條運川、以作紙幣之保證、業經中央核准、日内卽行運川、外傳川省請撥勦匪軍資一千萬之說、實係誤傳、至關於第五次全國代表大會東北四省代表産生問題、記者以此詢諸孔氏、據答、此事當由中央黨部組織委員會計議、該四省出席五全大會代表之産生、或將先從該四省以前黨部之數目及黨員人數之調查入手、然後再計議産生方法、是否將由中央指派、則未聞有决定、</p>
<p>擬赴西南視察財政</p>
<p>自孔氏已决定於政務空暇時赴西南一行、視察各該省財政情形、並非啣有任何使命、何日成行、尙未决定、孔氏並擬於西南視察之後、再赴四川甘肅雲南等省視察云、</p>
<p>黃郛昨晨接見記者</p>
<p>定一週後入京北上</p>
<p>詳述贛省治績足資全國效法</p>
<p>華北秩序恢復不能謂無進步</p>
<p>行政院駐平政務整理委員會委員長黄郛、上月奉汪院長蔣委員長電約、赴廬山會商政務、業於六日晚乘坐永綏兵艦返滬、特於昨晨十時、在私寓接見各報社記者、</p>
<p>發表書面談話　云、余於八日十日應汪院長蔣委員長之約到廬山、原擬一星期卽返、乃適蔣委員長在溽暑劇勞之後、略感不適、故在廬山勾留稍待、現蔣委員長政躬已完全恢復健康、每日親理政務如常、在此勾留期間、曾利用機會將贛省剿匪工作、及匪區收復後之政治建設考察一下、但覺各機關工作人員無不堅忍耐勞、埋頭苦幹、以極少數之員額、處理極多量之事務、故一切工作極爲緊張、一掃從前泄沓之風、此點實爲最值得各地公務人員之觀摩、與效法者也、關於華北政務、現在殷局長自先北返視事、戰區整理問題、亦不久可逐件着手進行、總之、大戰之後、瘡痍未復、民力凋疲、整理政務與恢復秩序、本非易事、就目前現狀論、當然不能盡如人意、然較之去年今日不能說無若干進步云云、</p>
<p>贛省制度完備</p>
<p>黄　黄黄氏旋答覆　各記者之詢問、略謂、本人此次留贛日期旣多、遂利用空暇、考察該省政治、因贛省係匪區、華北係災區、頗可供觀摩效法之處、考察結果、得知贛省公務人員均能埋頭苦幹、贛省制度、經詳細研究後、巳極完備、該省治權統一、故政治之推進、以及經費之節省等、均見良好成績、本人認爲此種制度、足爲全國各省效法、故巳將該省法令制度細規等、抄得一份、以便到北平後、交與華北長官參閱效法、</p>
<p>整理華北問題</p>
<p>關於華北各問題、此次在廬山亦曾與汪院長蔣委員長便中談及、災區之整理將着手進行、惟在環境上事實上進行殊感非易、自當一步一步做去、至於華北政務整理問題、亦當次第進行黄氏繼又謂、歐洲經濟力量等、一切較厚於我國、而戰後戰區元氣之恢復、亦未能迅速恢復云、</p>
<p>一週後即北返</p>
<p>黄氏繼云、此次返滬、係料理家務、擬作一星期之勾留、卽入京、訪謁汪院長、然後北返銷假、至於外傳華北中日問題解决困難云云、亦係一種揣度蓋任何問題、須視自己之努力爲斷、例如我人手上午一瘡癤、當使全身之血球運往抵抗、則　療體健云云、</p>
<p>十萬包</p>
<p>貢米前晨到滬</p>
<p>南北米市價格續跌</p>
<p>大公社云、本市米商曁銀錢業所訂九月期之西貢米、首批十萬包、於上月二十三日裝外輪運滬、已於六日上午進口、抛泊楊樹浦碼頭、本市各訂購該批貢米之米商、及銀錢業、均於昨日、持訂貨成單、紛向經理之達孚·泰隆·公和·等洋行提貨、計九月期貢米、每包以司馬秤一百八十斤計算、價值十一元七角、將新制市斛一百五十斤折合、每石僅在十元之内、故此次到滬之貨、早經售出、尙有十月期之四十萬包、預定於本月底裝滬、</p>
<p>南北米市價格續跌</p>
<p>南北市米業市塲所到之各帮米船、連日均儎新米、陳米反形見少、近因各處米糧備積較多、以致内地運滬之米、最高價格、已跌至十三元五角限價内、其中次號米在十二元與十一元左右、昨晨本埠陣雨降落後、市塲所開出價盤又復低跌二三角不等、據米業界之觀察、將來洋米全部湧到、晚稻登塲後、米價必有特殊之低跌云、</p>
<p>贛省貢米復運來滬</p>
<p>贛省前以本年旱荒成災、米價飛漲、民食發生恐慌、省府爲設法救濟起見、經飭該省裕民銀行、在滬購辦貢米一萬包、分運南昌九江兩地平糶、茲以該省新到鄰省穀頗多、價格每担驟跌三元左右、而滬米價格、則仍堅挺、故擬將屯積在九江之貢米五千包、運滬求售、以資調劑糧食之供求、昨據本市米業消息、該項米糧一部業已到滬、餘數亦將於下週内續到、</p>

<p>潘序倫前日由湘返滬</p>
<p>談湘省建設進步情形</p>
<p>希望外省金融界投資</p>
<p>本年中國經濟學社、在長沙舉行第十一屆年會、順道攷察湘省經濟建設情形、該社上海方面社員、前去赴會者、計有潘序倫、李權時·盛灼三·唐慶增·莊智煥·金國寳·等二十餘人、茲悉潘序倫君以職務忙迫、先於前日回抵滬上、潘君昨語往訪者云、</p>
<p>余隨經濟學社同人、赴長沙出席年會、並承湘省何主席之邀請、得以參觀長沙一帶新政、及社會實業之設施成績、茲特舉其崖略、以爲關心省政及實業者告、</p>
<p>湖南省府主席何鍵氏、自民國十九年春、排除共禍、主持湘政以來、四五年間、已能使湘省漸入平治之境、何氏在政治設施方面、均能以身作則、對於各項建設、無不努力進行、故極爲湘民所愛戴、雖以一身而兼掌軍政黨三權、但覺其毫無官氣、出入自由、擯除扈從、一方面對於推進文化、改良敎育、提倡工業、統計調查等事、積極進行、省府方面、巳有關於湖南各項統計刊物出版、如湖南年鑑·湖南經濟調查所叢刊·湖南人口統計·湖南物價指數·等等、不下四五十種、國術一項、經何主席身自提倡、發達甚爲普通、余等赴國術俱樂部參觀、見其中之表演者、有男女中小學生·軍隊·及普通仕女各界、何主席及各廳長、亦雜坐羣衆間參觀、何主席本人亦精國術、步入塲内、表演一番、此種平民化之尙琥官吏、實堪爲軍政界當局之模範、至于湖南各級精神、就余數日内所見情形觀之、可謂絶少官氣、一切事務、各長官均能身先僚屬、自行操作、誠屬難得、</p>
<p>湖南敎育、本稱發達、年來胡庶華氏主辦湖南大學、每月僅支省欵兩萬元、而其各院系之成績、較之月費六七萬元之國立大學、且較優良、至於社會敎育、則發達程度、實較蘇浙京滬各處爲優、本社同人、承敎廳之邀、到長沙中山堂作公開之講演、所講者爲經濟問題及改良會計等問題、每塲聽者、上下滿座、不下一二千人、本社前在他處公開講演之時、從未有如許聽衆、此可見湖南一般民衆敎育程度之高、且對於社會經濟問題之特别關心也、</p>
<p>湖南省之貿易情形、聞諸何主席言、每年均係入超月達一百八十萬元、其中以汽油及捲烟二項爲最大、故補救入超之法、即從此處着手、湖南省立工業試騐所、業巳發明使用酒精以代汽油、而各公私團體、羣起提倡不吸捲烟、余等所到各處、每見牆上貼有「恕不敬烟」之紙條、而公署黨部等處且貼有「奉諭禁吸烟捲」字樣、因之事實上、湘省之吸捲烟者、大爲减少、捲烟之輸入額、年來亦大爲低落、湖南爲謀抵貿易之人超計、從代替汽油及不吸捲烟上着手、即發生絶大效力、可見萬事祇須刻實去做、並非難事、長沙工業方面、其最有價值之新發明、即爲酒精汽車一項、此事經省立工業試騐所試騐成功、在普通汽車之上、略加特别裝置、便可以酒精代替汽油、作爲燃料、余等居留長沙一星期、每日所乘者、均爲燃燒酒精之汽車、所有一切開車行走停車等情形、並無絲毫不便、查湖南在二三年前、曾有木炭汽車之發明、但以木炭爲燃料、仍有種種不便、燃料佔用車上地位太多、且不淸潔、且起火須時、力量稍次今以酒精代替汽油、則一切困難、均可免除、現在省政府建設廳、正在設廠自造酒精、使其成本低廉、巳有成效、茲值我國發展公路推廣航空之時、一年輸入汽油、價值之大、殊可驚異、湘省能以自製酒精、代替汽油、其對於國民生計及國防上之重要、誠難以言語表示也、</p>
<p>長沙工業、除固有之紡廠機器廠外、新組織者、有煉鋅廠·玻璃廠·及造紙廠等、均由省府撥付省欵、提倡開辦、所有玻璃器具出品、十分精良、確足以抵舶來品而有餘、至於造紙廠、則新近開工、以就近原料豐富、故成績必佳、惟攷各廠資本、均屬短少、多者二十萬、少者五六萬元而巳、有此發展實業機機、祗望集中於上海之鉅額資金、略以數百萬元之微數、投入湘省、以資經管、則公私交利、成效立覩、深望上海之資本家、注意此項機會焉、</p>
<p>又何主席對於湘省之風景建設、亦復不遺餘力、本社同人、此次承省府招待、赴南嶽游覽、南嶽爲湘省第一名勝、局勢雄偉、省府特設南嶽管理局、積極從事修路·植樹·整理名勝古蹟·等工作、已覺斐然可觀、山高三千餘尺、夏間氣候甚凉、闢作避暑區域、實堪與匡廬莫干媲美、本社此次年會、適逢溽暑、一入衡山、便覺凉快、想粤漢玉萍兩鐡路、不日造成、由上海廣州等處、前赴南嶽、爲程不過兩日、彼時前去遊覽者當必踪相接也、</p>

<p>核减鐡路運價與發展農村</p>

<h3>讀書問答</h3>
<p>結婚後的女人底自學問題（四續）</p>
<p>再就談到做丈夫的方面。婦女的自學，本來是婦女切身的問題，不是别人可以解决得了的。但因爲丈夫往往是家庭制度的支持者，是與妻子共同生活的，所以他的一舉一動對於女子的自學，實際上有莫大的影響，而對於婦女自學問題，也就負有相當解决的責任。</p>
<p>如劉君的那位朋友一樣，把書籍介紹給他的女人看，自然是必要的，並且應該盡力所能及，投她所好，（不要依據自己的主見）多買書報以供她瀏覽，以慢慢引起她的興趣。但這不是最基本的辦法，所以劉君的朋友還致於遭到妻子的拒絶，最基本的辦法，便是不要把女子看做自己的俘虜，應該增進她進入社會的勇氣，使兩方面的愛情建築在共同努力事業上。（包括研究學問）於是一方面要减少她的生活與思想間的矛盾，即是儘可能减輕她對於家庭瑣事的責任，讓她有舒一口氣的餘閒，這樣，她自然要减少家庭生活的苦悶，而至於找尋不正當的刺激。（一面要她做一個忠實的主家婦，一面又要她努力讀書，這是不可能的，這只是做丈夫的由於自己新舊思想的矛盾所發生的一種空想。）另一方面就是提高她的自學興趣，這在前面巳經說過了。</p>
<p>總之，再說一遍，結婚後女子的自學問題乃是關係整個婦女解放問題、要有努力婦女解放才能獲得圓滿的解决。</p>
<p>最後，本文根據劉君的來信，所論到的，乃是一般有知識的婦女，而没有特别提出工人店員婦女的自學，這算是一個很大的缺點，這缺點，只有等到有機會時再來填補。</p>

<h3>養化銅檢波</h3>
<p>— 石華玉</p>
<p>通常收音機的檢波工作是由眞空管來担任，但現在巳有人發現用養化銅（ＣＵＯ）來做高週率整流器，而且實騐的結果也很完滿。在十弗打以上的高週率電壓輸入的時候，養化銅的檢波効力很好。就是當調幅成分在百分之七十的時候，牠棆波後所輸出的低週率電壓也和輸入的高週率電壓大小一樣，没有什麽損失。並且經過積密的測量，雖然高週率電壓輸入時較高，而養化銅所完成的檢波依然是直綫的。因此比之普通用眞空管作檢波器時所引起的特性曲綫上曲綫部份的失眞可以避免。並且在節省收音機地位的一方面着想，養化銅也是較勝於眞空管的。因爲養化銅在同一効率之下，可以比眞空管的直徑小得多。同時我們還可以用四塊養化銅作全波整流或全波檢波（ＤoppelwegＧieichrichtung）呢。四塊養化銅拚起來的面積也不過祇有一隻燈座的地位那麽大罷了。</p>
<p>同時養化銅製造方面比眞空管就容易許多了，就是價值方面也遠低於眞空管，而効率又是這樣的高，不久的將來恐怕要取眞空管的檢波地位而代之呢。至於十弗打以上的高週率電壓，我們祇要用一級或兩級的高週率放大就很容易得到的。養化銅還有一個最重要的特性，就是衰落補充（ＦADINGKOMPENSATION）的便當，因爲我們祇要照牠在十弗打至一百弗打的高週率電壓下檢波的性能加以一些調整便得了。</p>
<p>至於裝配時所最要注意的，是務必要盡量使牠有最大的電流通過。養化銅檢波器和高週率放大器最適當的交連可以參照附圖。茲爲使讀者明瞭起見，圖中並將衰落補充段畫出，因此圖中的養化銅並不是完全作檢波用的，其中用爲管理誤落補充的一隻是傳到高週率及中間週率的可變放大係數放大管的栅極，而調節輸入的信號電壓的。</p>
<p>同時因爲牠檢波後的輸出電壓極高（在百分之七十調幅時所輸出的低週率電壓差不多和輸入的高週率電壓相同，而雜聲的成分（klirrfoktorR）還不到百分之○·五）所以直接去激勵末級眞空管是一些困難也没有的。圖中電阻Ｂ可以作音量調節之用。</p>
<p>用了高週率養化銅整流器以後、收音機的裝置便可大大的簡單了。所以普通便應用多栅管例如可變放大係數的五極管—輸入電力可以很小的特性，用爲高放。低放和超外差式的本地振盪器則用普通的三極管担任。讀者試想如果有一隻收音機，牠的高放是用一隻可變放大係數的五極管，檢波用養化銅作全波整流，低放用三極末級强力放大管，同時還有一隻用養化銅的衰落補充段，而實際上這隻効力比三管收音機的無綫電機所用却不過兩隻眞空管，並且其中的一只還是價格很便宜的末級强力放大管呢，這樣的收音機才可以算得平民化啊！</p>
<h3>怎樣添置調整指示表</h3>
<p>— 明襄</p>
<p>許多收音機，雖有自動音量控制的作用，却没有調整指示表（Ｔuningmeter）裝置，在調整電臺時，不能以肉眼觀察那一度是最靈敏點，實爲憾事，如果要使你的收音機格外高貴，不妨依本篇所述，僅須添接一平常的千分安培表，便可達到目的。</p>
<p>第一步先須研究你收音機的線路，以决定電表應接在何處、通常最優越的地位，在被自動控制的高週率或中間週率級的眞空管，其屏路經濾波器後，接至Ｂ電正極的引綫處，若被控制的，不僅一級，則任擇其一均可，如圖中Ａ及Ｂ處，如各眞空管所受的控制電壓，大小並不相同，則最好接在最大的一級内，如此，可使電表指針的跳動較劇，調整時更爲明顯。電表連接，必須在濾波器接Ｂ＋的一端，否則高週率流將通過電表，而使放大級不穩定，且有損及電表之虞。</p>
<p>爲便利起見，電表如接在各被控制管，連接Ｂ＋的共同引綫處亦可，如此，經過的電流加大，而變動的比率，仍與前者無異，如圖中Ｃ處，但切不可將電表誤接在與其他不受自動音量控制作用眞空管的共同引綫處。卽各被控制管的共同引綫，如各管控制電壓不同時，亦不可連接指示表，此點應加注意。</p>
<p>電表的範圍，應擇小於其連接之綫路内，在無訊號輸入時之電流數值，假定此綫路内之電流爲ＩＯＭ·Ａ·則電表之範圍，不能超過。５Ｍa'，如o-I或o-2M·a·均可，因如此方可使收音機在未調整至電臺時，電表的指針，得校配至最大度數，以後如有訊號輸入，指針跳動的距離最大，指示表的作用，亦最靈敏。較配的方法，可在電表兩端跨接一變阻器，以作枝路（shunt），變動此枝路的電阻，使無訊號輸入時，電表的指針適示最大度數爲止。</p>
<p>此種指示表，極爲靈敏，雖極微弱的訊號，在普通陰景式（shadowtype）指示表不能覺察者，此表指針，亦能得明顯的跳動，更有一優點，卽或收音機受天電騷擾時，電表指針，並不顫動甚劇，以致不能鑒别微弱電臺的訊號。</p>
<h3>利用電壓表爲電流表</h3>
<p>— 庸言</p>
<p>一隻電流表與一歐姆數甚大之耗阻串聯後，卽成一電壓表。因照「歐姆定律」經過此電流表之電流，與此電流表二端所接之電壓成正比：故只須將刻度改爲相當之弗打數，卽可用以測量電壓矣。如此可知電壓表可設法利用爲電流表，今將改法分述如下：</p>
<p>甲·將該電壓表拆開，取去其串聯耗阻，卽成一電流表。（若將該耗阻接入，則仍爲電壓表）至此電表之刻度，可用另一準確之電流表與之流勘而得之。若此電流表可量之範圍尙嫌過小，則可並接一耗阻以爲分流器（shunt），而增大其範圍。此耗阻之算法爲Ｒ＝r÷（Ｎ—Ｉ）式中Ｒ爲分流器之歐姆數，Ｒ爲電流表之内阻，Ｎ爲欲增大之倍數。例如有一内耗阻一歐姆之電流表，可量之範圍爲○·一安培，欲使之可量至半安培，問應並接若干歐姆之耗阻。因此處r爲一·Ｎ爲五：代入上式，得Ｒ爲Ｏ·二五歐姆，故知應並接一只○·二五歐姆之耗阻。</p>
<p>乙·普通電壓表之低壓段，其串聯耗阻不過二三百歐姆，故亦可用以量電流。（請參閱本刊三十二期克君君稿）其度數之改算，可利用歐姆定律。例如有一低壓段爲十弗打之電壓表，其内耗阻（見註）爲四百歐姆；則當指針指於十弗打時，經過此電表之電流爲四百分之十安培，卽二十五千分安培；放原表上第一弗打相當於二個半千分安培。如此之電流表亦可如甲法加接分流器，以增大可測電流之範圍。</p>
<p>以上二法中甲法較爲雀確，乙法則僅限於測量有高耗阻之電路中之電流，否則量得之數不可靠。用乙法時，若該被量之電路中之耗阻及電表之内耗阻爲巳知，則可將測得之數加以校正，其法如下：</p>
<p>先以該電表量出電流量Ｉ，再以下式求出準確電流量Ｉ＝（iＲ＋ir）÷Ｒ式中r爲該電表之内耗阻，Ｒ爲該電路中除該電表以外之耗阻。</p>
<p>（註）電壓表之内耗阻，大多註明於該表上或說明書上。如無之，可以歐姆表式惠斯登電橋量之；或以下法求之。法以一耗阻Ｒ與該電壓表串聯，而接其二端至一電壓爲Ｅ之電池上；若該電表之指針指於e弗打處，則該電表之内耗阻r爲r=e×R÷（Ｅ—e）照此法以不同數值之Ｒ及Ｅ，求出數個r再求其平均數，以爲該電壓表之内耗阻之準確數值。</p>
<h3>以５８作檢波之單管收音機綫路</h3>
<p>— 子佩</p>
<p>用三極管做單管機，每嫌音量太低，不能滿足慾望，一般業餘家常將多極新式眞空管改爲單管機，成績每有出乎意外者，本刊已介紹之２A5’３３强力單管機，聽收本埠各電臺，壛能用喇叭放音，其音量决非用三極管之單管機所能比擬。現在再介紹一張用５８高放管做檢波的綫路，其音量極宏大，而靈敏度比用２A或３３爲高，因５８本爲一高放管也。爲求設備之節省計，採用半交流式，燈絲電流以普通電鈴方棚改繞供給，電壓爲二·五弗打，電流爲一安培，乙電用一百三十五弗打卽可，如加至一百八十弗打其音量可增加。其綫路及５８之接法如下圖：</p>
<h3>圖一　圖二</h3>
<p>LL1L2爲普通三回路綫圈，用變量電容器Ｃr調節（亦可用推挽架調節）Ｃ與Ｃ１爲·○○○三五變量電容器，Ｃ２爲·○○○二五固定電容器，Ｒ爲二兆至四兆歐姆，Ｒ·Ｆ·Ｃ·爲廣播用之高週率阻流圈ＯＧＳ接乙電之最高壓，而以六千歐姆之變量耗阻Ｒ１調節之，則可改舊音質及音量至最佳處，如不用耗阻調節，則可接至乙電九十弗打或一百三十五弗打處，總之ＧＳ之電壓開係此機之音量及音質極大，如電壓過大則聲音反被扼住，過低則音輕面質劣。</p>
<p>５８之銲接如圖二，陰栅Ｓn和陰極Ｃ相接，帽子爲控制栅極，簾栅極接六千歐姆之音量調節器，陰極接乙負，共餘照三極管接法，惟熱絲Ｈ，因用交流電，不能與乙電相接。</p>
<p>此機之天綫回路至多十二圈，過多則選擇性不佳，鄙人曾在吳淞用室内天綫收聽上海南京各大小電臺，日夜均能在揚聲器中放音，若改用室外天綫，則成績諒能更佳。</p>
<p>此機當能改成全交流式，整流用８２'８０等均可，喜裝拆之同志，不妨一試。</p>

<h3>焊錫的代用品</h3>
<p>— 善長</p>
<p>有許多人以爲包香烟的是錫紙，但是現在所用的都是鉛紙，因此若把它焊接是不成功的，因爲鋁加大熱，不過成三氣化鋁不傳電的物質罷了。</p>
<p>我們若找代替品，只有用牙膏瓶，牙膏瓶確係錫製，用時把外面的假漆用砂皮打去，即能應用，若假漆不打去，焊時因有機物炭化，那麽就有點困難了，此外包軟片的外殻也能用，用時不必把砂皮打，似覺便利，但找起來没有牙膏瓶容易找到。</p>
<p>焊錫到銅匠買得少很不便宜，買得多也不合算，那麽我們用上法是很好的。</p>
<h3>旋轉式燈絲開關自製法</h3>
<p>— 傳訓</p>
<h3>Ａ板木膠　Ｂ銅片（二）　Ｃ鑰轉　Ｄ全部</h3>
<p>燈絲開關（switchoffilament），是收音機上不可少的另件。苛樣繁多，牠的構造又甚複雜，我們没有相當機械的人，不易自作，因爲在電路開放時，各項導體須密接不懈，如是方可减小綫路中之電阻。電路關閉時，又須絶緣佳而穩固，不使有漏電可能。而且在開關時須有彈性之助力。價錢便宜的，總是不切實用，所以我們選用開關時，除上述的條件俱備外，並須顧及牠的價格及所佔地位等。下述乃適合於我們自製簡易而切實用的開關作法。</p>
<p>Ａ爲所需膠木或硬橡皮板的式樣，三孔可以熱鑽燙之。</p>
<p>Ｂ爲彈性銅片式樣，共二片。</p>
<p>Ｃ爲硬木質轉鑰。半爲圓柱，半爲較大之正方柱，粗銅絲串繞之。</p>
<p>然後以轉鑰圓棒穿入膠木大孔中。再將兩銅片，緊壓於兩側（見圖Ｄ，下端各以螺絲固定之）。</p>
<p>圓棒穿入處，最好加一個螺旋管，用以裝上收音機。</p>

<h3>秋季禮讚</h3>
<p>— 履謙</p>
<p>秋，是偉大的，是可愛的！秋的確是一年之中最好的季節，它没有像那冬季的寒威凛冽，它没有像那夏季的暑氣薰蒸；它更比那惱人的春天來得活潑，淸高！它確能令人從枯寂的心靈裏得到一種幽靜的快感和安慰！</p>
<p>秋，就這様地降臨到人間來了！這靑的山，這綠的水，多麽美麗！皎潔！變幻的秋雲，連天的秋雨，又多麽能表現出秋的詩意來！秋，在繁華的都市中，它顯出驕矜鎭靜的美態，啟示「簾捲金風，園凝玉露」的新秋時節，隨着，腰肢婀娜鬢鬤　曲的摩登姑娘們，相率更換了窄袖長袍的新秋時裝，迎着柔爽的凉風，拂開了兩旁的衣袂，露出那富於彈性的腿膀，銀色的高跟鞋；隨着纖巧的兩足有節拍的移動，發出閃亮的銀光，伊們淺淺的笑渦，常從小小的櫻唇邊浮出，顯露了秋季賜予内心的舒適和愉快！一切的人們也好似被炎暑所悶倒而給秋的扶救才得透出一口汚濁的窒氣，而能活躍如故了！人們對秋的降臨表示着無限的好感，秋在這樣的環境中，也足以自慰而自傲了！</p>
<p>鄉村的秋，它更顯出嫵媚自然的美態，無數田疇裏半靑夾黄的稻穗，都長得非常豐滿，粒粒的白米在薄薄的殻中包着，又嫩又實，在那裏臨風搖曳；期待着那辛勤的農夫在不久的將來來收割。這時負笠的老農笑逐顔開，能相像得出！他深受着秋賜給他們的利益，藴藏着無限的欣喜！</p>
<p>秋，怎樣使得我依戀！懷慕！我願美麗而幽靜的秋永久的駐在人間！</p>
<h3>反悲秋</h3>
<p>— 梅雪</p>
<p>素以詩名的老先生，又在那裏聳起着吟肩了，他見梧桐葉在空中飛舞，便哭喪着聲調，又在那裏吟那悲秋的詩了。小子起着好奇心，忙問：「老求你伸寃，你的悲秋好没來由！」老先生怫然道：「爾小生，毋多言，「悲哉秋之爲氣也，」是宋大夫的興歎，「但聞四壁蟲聲喞喞，如助余之歎息，」是歐陽子的寄慨，古人尙然，何况我輩？爾小生，毋多談。」</p>
<p>經這一說，倒開動了小子的話匣；「老先生錯了！秋是收成的黄金時代，秋是結果的美滿時期，只有欣慰，那有悲傷。無病呻吟的舊式詩人，他見黄葉一片片的飛下，好像樹木都受了創傷，一經墮落，便憔翠的不成了模樣。誰知郤是老大的纏誤，不有落葉，那有結果，要是一草一木，都保存着花花綠綠的常態，花不彫，葉不落，那麽，怎有美滿的收成結果呢？没有收成結果，那麽田野之間，便不會産生五穀，林塲之中，也不會成熟百果，豈不要引起社會上的絶大恐慌麽？可見秋的時期，正給予我們一個很有希望的時期，秋到了，百物成熟了，穀實不久要登塲了，果類不久要上市了，老農老圃所巴巴盼望的，只有這個秋季。做詩人的應該和大衆共鳴，偶動詩興，該說些歡迎秋來盼望秋至的話頭，「秋風起，木葉飛，」這些都是吉祥的預兆，不該無病呻吟，做些頽喪的詩句，不該人云亦云，宋大夫興歎，你也要興歎，歐陽子寄慨、你也要寄慨，你難道成了宋大夫歐陽子的應聲蟲麽？詩人要有獨立性質，掇拾古人的唾餘，尙且不可，何况做那古人的應聲蟲呢？老先生錯了！」</p>
<p>話匣開罷，老先生已不知去向了。他旣不吟詩，倒是小子來胡謅幾句吧：</p>
<p>人云，秋風搖百草，我云：秋風成萬寳，「洞庭波兮木葉飛，」此是有秋之陑兆，幪懂詩人賦悲秋，是謂：「恶人之所好。」</p>
<h3>秋的兩面觀</h3>
<p>— 梁小鴻</p>
<p>郊野，一片茶綠色，老楓樹的葉子像朱唇似的點綴其間；大氣中浮着一層薄紫色淺霧；平靜的河面，緩緩地向人送着秋波。夕陽斜照的當兒，温軟的草原上，有着一種柔情依戀的感覺。晚來，澄淸皎潔的月色，撒滿在空間；破磚草叢中，秋蟲在那兒奏着交響的樂曲……。呵，可愛的秋天，伊確是全年中最動人的一季！伊像一位林黛玉式的少婦，生着質樸而端莊的外貌，沉默而有含蓄的個性；美麗之中，帶着不可侵犯的嚴肅，恬靜的裏面，却又藴藏着眞摯熱烈的情緖。伊的一切，具有使人憫憐散愛的魅力；我們在伊的懷抱中，簡直再没中什麽不舒服的了！</p>
<p>然而，在另一方面，伊却够怕人的，處處潛伏着肅殺之機。好鬥的蟋蟀，就是伊的産物之一。人們在不經意中，隨時有被病魔襲擊殺害的可能。痢疾吐瀉一類的時疫症、是伊最恐怖的示威運動。不聽見嗎？時疫醫的門診，每天有二百多號呢！啊，殺人的秋季，伊是人們每年必須經過的難關；我們得大家謹愼着，不要被伊呑没了呀！</p>
<p>秋季，秋季到底是可愛的還是可怕的呢？</p>

<p>「蠅，一樣東西，說起來，眞多麽利害啊！然而吾們以前古書裏頭，但以爲「靑蠅亂色，蒼蠅亂聲，」像詩經小鴉上「營營靑蠅」一句話，那箋云，「蠅之爲蟲，汚白使黑，汚黑使白，」不過譬喻一般小人，顚倒善惡的意思；到了後漢隗囂傳中，就有「蒼蠅之飛，不過數步，即託驥尾，可以絶羣，」纔知道「蠅」的能力，實在非常偉大，苟倚靠着旁的勢脈，這不是很可怕的禍首麽？</p>
<p>今年在夏天的時候，好！天公像火一般放射驕陽，晒在地面，以致河乾水淺，就是種植禾稻的水田，也會乾燥得龜裂，使這靑靑的秧苗黄萎欲死；所以其佗的種種害蟲，受着不少影響，難以繁殖，滅殺了多量的分子，那末：平心而講，在農作方面，固然不免歉收，成了荒象，而於人類衛生上，因爲天旱，空氣燥烈，一切微生蟲等等；没有附着的所在得以生存，倒反而獲到很多利益，但普通缺乏常識的人們，不知不覺罷了！</p>
<p>現在呢！己經交了秋，大家以爲溽暑可退新凉襲人，不是像伏天的令人要喝死了！哦！那曉得天氣仍然很熱，而與我們人生作大敵的像「蠅」一類，倒嗡嚨嗡嚨盛起來了；這是什麽緣故呢？</p>
<p>吾不敢說過火話，實在秋天比那夏時，不淸潔的地方，眞來得多，就在街道上看，西瓜皮啊，蘆菽皮啊，蕃麥楂啊，隨處足以引着無數的「蠅」來嘬聚，這樣：「蠅」自然日聚日多；照科學家講，「蠅」自蟻以迄肾，到成蟲的時期，雖有長短，而每一次所産的卵，咦！至少要有一百數十個，以雌雄各半計算，從此不時的交媾，佗的子子孫孫，約傳十代，那末：「蠅」的世系，不是佔有了一百兆兆的多麽？喲！這種可驚的人生大敵，就要在秋熱的天氣中間，想法撲滅纔是。</p>
<h3>跋</h3>
<p>我與鳥中杜鵑，同是天地間的愁種子，所以雖在春夏，而憂國憂家，常懷着悲秋的情緖。如今偏又到了秋季！這「秋雨秋風愁穀人」的秋季，我的悲哀更不用說了。秋夜無俚，檢讀四方文友的來稿，竟不少關於「秋」的文字，因此來了一個「秋」的特刊，以示同調。是爲跋。甲戌之秋，周瘦鵑跋於紫羅蘭盦。</p>
<h3>秋蟲閒話</h3>
<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>照例應該在這兒寫個小引，最妙不過的是：「一年容易，又是秋風。」秋風中啼着暗蛩，聲音那麽雄銳，使人感到一種意趣。你要是童年時代，曾住在鄉村裏的話，你一定在自己家園的碍瓦下，在院落的花壇邊，尖着耳聽一陣，心雖然在笑，但是鎭靜的；等到决定那聲音的出處，你便幽手幽脚的跑過去，拿着金絲罩，蹲定以後，靜亮了眼珠子，一面輕輕地移開碍瓦，一面很迅速的把金絲罩向蟀蟋的身上罩下去。要是它一跳就逃，勢必你也跳起身來追捕，這時候，那種追逐的勇氣，確是非常可笑的。</p>
<p>然而童年時代捉蟋蟀，也如捉螢火蟲一樣没有目的，只覺得很好玩而巳。後來瞧見大人們在茶館裏就用蟋蟀，互相秤量之後，用小草兒挑撥它們鬭爭，因而决定養蟋蟀的主子，以金錢來决定勝負；於是知道蟋蟀還有别一種用處，何怪鴉片鬼也鎭日出去翻磚剔瓦，甚至向墓槨裏去搜索，爲的還可以賺錢。</p>
<p>但家裏的爺娘，對於小孩子不好好温書寫字，而與野孩子們捉蟋蟀，爺娘一定要痛駡不肖，一定不許把蟋蟀帶回家去。即使偷偷地把那小蟲兒放在火柴匣子裏，（因爲没有錢並且也不敢冠冕地買蟋蟀盆）臨睡放在枕頭角邊，可禁不住它不呌，呌聲一起，爺娘就順手拿火柴匣子丢向痰盂去，並且說捉蟋蟀的人，將來都要變成歪二秃子那麽不成器的潑皮的，歪二秃子的確連短褲也碎了，只每天蹲在墓槨邊尖着耳朶。</p>
<p>小孩子的心愛的呌蟲給丢掉，無邪的心，刻着怎樣的創傷是可以想見的。他幾乎失去了他的木馬或洋囡囡一樣的悲哀着。然而他不敢向爺娘反抗，他只恨着爺娘。爲什麽自己的爺娘，不像茶館阿虎對待他們的兒女！白天不是小老虎捉着了一個大蟋蟀，他的爺儘撫着他的頭髮，連聲讚他聰明，還撓起大拇指，看看蟋蟀，對人大聲呌着：「這是將軍！這還不是將軍！啼得多響！牙兒又多大！」</p>
<p>不加稱贊，也就罷了。但爲什麽人家的孩子可以捉蟋蟀，自家便不能。不能捉也就罷了，你爲什麽把巳捉來的不放它向庭院裏去，仍使它活着，而却丢向痰盂去淹死？你聽，丢下去之後，一直呌着，大約給水浸着了它的羽翼，而且還發出火柴匣子打在銅痰盂上的聲音，一定蟋蟀在掙扎，在哀鳴，但是……。現在却半點聲音都已寂滅，夜那樣凄凉，孩子的心在暗泣。</p>
<p>以上的叙述，雖是我個人的想像，可是同樣的事實，决定會有。小孩子那時怨恨爺娘的心情，誰都不能避免。自家幼年也很頑皮，爲了一度捉蟋蟀，被娘訓誡一番後，再也不敢重犯了。然而那時，並不覺得玩蟋蟀竟壞到如何的程度，當然不理解此種遊戲，是會喪失進取的意志而沉緬於賭博的下流習慣喲！</p>
<p>以後讀宋史，覺得賈似道在半閒堂裏，除了和姬妾縱樂外，竟因迷戀於玩蟋蟀而不問政治，便知道以前爺娘所以訓誡的理由。沈周過葛嶺，有一首詩說到這件事道：</p>
<p>「閒堂寳閣畫圖中，天乞湖山養相公。正是襄樊多事日，却特征戰試秋蟲！一——眞是諷刺得幽默！殊不知先後輝映者，還有放風筆踢健子的把戲咧！至於天寳遺事裏所說：「每至秋至，宮中妃嬪，競以小金籠捉蟋蟀，置之枕函畔，夜聽其聲。」這倒又似上文所叙述的小孩子偷藏蟋蟀的意味。然而同時也可見王朝的宮人，大有「不得見者三十六年」的悲哀。所以凡是詠蟋蟀的詩，多半包含灌肅殺的情調，如白居易的「暗蛩喞喞夜綿綿」，張來的「石底暗鞏先夜鳴」，温庭筠的「枯池接斷岸，喞喞啼寒螿；」能使自己像在沙蹟之間，夜深人靜，聽到凄寂的啼聲。只不知那些善於内訌的軍人，互相殺戮，竟忘掉作壁上觀的帝國主義者的正當他們爲蟋蟀，在發動小草，在挑撥他們屠殺，而外觀成敗；作何感想？</p>
<h3>秋夜獨步</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>愛人的眼珠子那麽温柔的夜，是秋夜哪！寂寞的，寂寞的。</p>
<p>挾着詩集，蹩出了花格門，用輕慢的步子走着小巷的靑皮石，秋蟲躱在牆脚洞裏，石塊縫裏，亂磚堆裏呌着哀愁，呌着苦怨，呌着夜的寂寥。</p>
<p>十五支光的電燈照着這長長的巷道，没被照到的地方便黯然地展開着蝙蝠的翅膀，充溢着秋意的夜風，迎面吹過來，吹滿胸懷，感覺着凄凉味。自己的瘦長影子有半截貼在白粉牆上，半截折倒地上，人是夾在高牆中間層，馴和的鹿踱在崖壁之下似的。過着閒適的時日呵。</p>
<p>過着淡味的空虚的生活，這蕭條的旅程。</p>
<p>走出了小巷，蓬萊路在秋月的光圍裏，輕輕地披着詩意的薄紗，砌道上的梧桐吹嘘着，秋風給它播了感傷的音調，秋月給它映出衰弱的影子，黄葉子受不了季節的摧殘，一朶朶飄落枝桿，到處流浪着，給各種不同的脚踐踏着，失掉了靈魂的人，頽廢生活中的没落者。</p>
<p>「淸節堂」門口黑油油地，月光給高風火牆遮住，似乎有不少幽靈在舉行着夜舞會，吊着顫拦的心，綳着汗毛孔，迅疾地走了過去，牆下的草索索地泣着秋夜的風。</p>
<p>一些矮屋，一些籬笆，一些燈火打板門縫裏透出來。天凉啦，露宿的人没有了，讓門前擠着無底的凄淸，沉寂，蕭條。像在荒島上的孤獨旅行者，像在荒漠上遊牧的蒙古土人。</p>
<p>跑進「文廟公園」，打蛋白色的燈光長窺探着東方建築的輪廓。月兒沉醉在溪流裏，翻開詩集默吟着，有入神的句子就吟出聲來，沿着灑滿月光的小徑，　着來又踱着去，秋夜的獨步者閉上了眼，有些兒醉了呢！</p>

<p>棉市連漲三日、稍現平定之局、惟買方以各路來源不暢、姚花抬價劇烈、兼之天氣陰雨、以白露節氣降雨、與棉花不利、於是浮空活動抵補、市盤尤緊、惟漢口黄帮、以價高抛出、午後市乃轉平、</p>

<p>昨日粉市、各月份初平繼穩、以洋麥報價、芝加哥坎拿大兩處、均回好一二角左右、當開價時、本月份市况、仍然平定、惟至十月份開價、因廠家抛售略懈、業外心思、則轉活絡、更因營口帮微有生意、故各月份平靜之中、略轉俏利、迨至下午開盤、交易比較淸寂、各月份之買賣、不過二十餘萬包、惟因廠出不豐、業外浮空、又無繼脫、市氣遂稍良好也、結果本月份較前日漲二分、十月份漲三分半、十一月份漲二分半、十二月份漲一分七釐半、一月份好二分二釐半、二月份漲二分五釐、</p>
<p>小麥現貨暗盤已升高</p>

<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份大致平疲、洋麥報價、芝加哥坎拿大兩處、雖好一二角不等、惟前日粉跌而麥市反漲、市氣未免不合常規、故開價後、市面初見平穩、旋則多頭回出、人心見軟、遠期較之前日收價、回落二三分不等、迨至下午開盤、初則甚疲、繼因内地客帮、收買步暢、又傳市上之現貨、有大批被行家囤進、故標凖局面、亦爲之帶起也、結果本月份較好三分、十月份二二分、十一月份好四分、十二月份好四分、一月份好三分、二月份好一角二分、現麥市面、巳轉穩勢、各檔開價、雖少榮辱、但高貨即巳暗升一二分不等、開山東五河徐州麥三元六角、蚌埠麥三元六角、次五角八分、瑶灣麥三元五角半、次四角八分、蕪湖麥三元三角、計六千包、由福新辦去云、</p>

<p>婺東珍眉歐銷略動</p>
<p>昨本埠洋莊茶市、交易尙不寂寞、婺源東路高莊珍眉綠茶、英莊怡和洋行、又復開辦、去路巳較前略爲活動、惟做開市盤八十六七元、較前日又减跌三四元、屯溪歙縣等路珍眉、亦均有零星走銷、惟婺源北路蠟光貨、依然無人問及、此外胃、但售盤亦均有跌無漲、</p>

<p>東白鐡售盤見鬆</p>
<p>東白鐡新到之貨、爲數頗夥、故市上巳有供過於求之槪、標凖受實銷滯呆影響、回鬆一二分不一、如三尺七尺每張售一元二角七分半、三尺六尺售一元○四分、交易雖長江路寗波諸帮微有收買、但爲數不多、内地帮以秋收歉薄、胃口大遜、福建甌紹諸路亦少點綴、市象十分寂寞、行情方面、恐要再小也云、</p>
<p>會司鐡好貨斷擋</p>
<p>二百磅會司鐡、其好貨如大箱薄張者、現市現貨均付缺乏、故全市流通者祗一種副號厚箱貨而巳、其價每箱估二十八元至二十九元、交易因物質較次、不甚衆多、業中人付出消息、謂好貨於本月底方有到來、</p>

<h3>我們要大喊其寃</h3>
<p>— 獸</p>
<p>—關於「偉大作品在那裏？」</p>
<p>偉大作品的産生，關於這個問題，記得早在好幾月以前，我們陳伯奇先生底「偉大作品的要求」一文中，巳經討論到。過後，在某月刊中，也曾經有過「中國目前爲什麽没有偉大作品産生」的徵文，而由許多作家來解答過，而散見在各處的，更是多多，然總而言之，約可分爲如下數則原因：</p>
<p>一·環境不良。</p>
<p>二·作家能力不够，缺乏勇氣。</p>
<p>三·文壇的門羅主義。</p>
<p>四·中國社會變動得太快，文學運動跟上上。</p>
<p>其實，這裏所說的作品的偉大與否，客觀的判斷就是很難决定的，怎樣的作品？什麽爲標準？來判斷作品是偉大與否呢？依我看來作家能把握住目前的現實社會，澈底地依據新的觀念；用寫實主義的手法來暗示時代的動向，就能活躍於讀者前面，而就變爲偉大的作品。換句話說，只要描寫眞實、就可成爲偉大作品；只要眞實地描寫現實，就能成爲歷史的紀念碑。</p>
<p>由此我們可以知道渾人先生在申報（三十日）自由談上，皇皇地論說是不準確的，渾人先生說偉大作品之所以被湮没在字紙簏裏、是在於「編輯者的門羅主義，與書店老闆的唯利是圖以外，更加以說主要責任，該派到讀者身上來負責的。我不懂渾人先生是怎樣的把話說油了嘴，拉扯到我們讀者頭上來；眞是天也曉得的罪過，這樣重大的損害整個中國文壇的罪孽，原來要我們來頂了去。我在此，不得不來喊一聲寃枉！</p>
<p>渾人先生說：「這種畸形現象之造成，編輯先生同書店老闆難逃其咎，但主要者不全在他們，而在一般盲目的讀者，因爲他們是一班毫無成見的可憐蟲，把着專着名作家著作的宗旨、文豪們說着幽默文字好，便看幽默的雜誌與書籍，說着小品文好，他們於是又擇小品文字看，總之　文豪們放個臭屁都是香的。至於無名作品根本便不屑一看，好像看了之後，於他們有損害似的。」</p>
<p>這幾句話，我們以爲渾人先生是下得太武斷了，太無根據了。名作家對於我們容易注意，那是實在的，因爲他們是熟了，而無名之作，因爲太生疏，容易忽略，那也是實在的。並且在未看到以前，我們就根本不曾知道有這樣一個新人提供了一篇好作品在某地方，又呌我們怎樣先期注意呢？當着目前的文壇，旣無偉大作品發現，而現實社會給我們的日常印象：又是如此惡劣，滿腹牢騷，苦無處洩憤，而幽默小品予我們以稍釋胸襟的喜笑，怒駡，是當然的被視爲唯一食量。說我們爲毫無成見的可憐蟲，不識好醜，那末試問，自五四以來，新進了多多少少的名家，就像渾人先生這般身登作家之羣，又是誰來識得的呢？據他說，有名作家之所以能成名，是「靠着初期的偉大的無名之作掙來的」那末這偉大的無名之作，又是誰來拜識的呢？我們不懂渾人先生所言，何以前後矛盾若此？</p>
<p>至於說無名之作，看了之後便有損害似的，這裏，做作家的便不懂讀者們苦衷了，第一，讀者們購買雜誌，就已經十分吃力，不要說書本，像以前出了什麽「無名作家專號」等，不是白化了很多金錢，内容無疑的不够資格，這是在經濟能力而言，在時間上說，在爲了挣得生活所費的時間，已是整整的一日，空餘的時間很少，多少有價值的書本尙無空餘來窮談，何來時間空耗在上當的結果裏？這裏損害巳經主要地存在了，更毋容多說其他。</p>
<h3>過老爺嶺</h3>
<p>— 西村</p>
<p>馬拉着車，懶懶的坐在車上的人，同樣是懶懶的。天太熱了，遇到下半天走了向西的路，太陽就從彎弓形的前車棚口，一直晒進車廂裏，懶懶的馬和懶懶的人都晒出來滿身汗水。</p>
<p>沿路，盡是山丘與田禾，風好像全被擋住了，其實是錯怪了風，遠近山上的樹林、都那麽表表地低郵着頭，呆站着，就是一個明證。所以，根本上這下午是没有刮風的。</p>
<p>「快近老爺嶺了。」車夫說。</p>
<p>單只在吉林省，以老爺嶺命名的山嶺，怕不止一只手上指頭的數目。這裏說的老爺嶺，在吉林省城西南四十里。從前。南滿路，吉長路没有完成前，凡是從瀋陽到吉林的人，必定要從這裏走過的，因爲這條路是大驛路。</p>
<p>聽車夫說走近了老爺嶺，懶懶的客人們和閉着眼睛順着車身顚簸打嗑睡的，都坐起來，用手攀着棚弓，一面還振作起精神兩眼張得大大的，向前路注視着。這都爲的嶺口是一個難關。</p>
<p>這是東嶺口，從底下一直到嶺頂，只少也有三里地長。路旁叢生着碧綠的林木，另一面是亂石遍佈的石灘，一灣深不過寸的泉水，在石灘上蜿蜒着。這裏没有多少田禾，多是樹林，有高的，有矮的還有些雜草野花。這裏也没有人居住。因此，歷年以來，到了靑紗帳起以後，就成了胡匪出没的窠巢。</p>
<p>「滿洲國」的治安維持，没有人敢和從前相比，遇到這樣地方，旅客自然要擔驚的。</p>
<p>「老客，眼晴可要留神哪。」</p>
<p>車夫說這話，我認爲是没有用處的，就算眼晴眞能觀八方，耳朶能够聽四路，請問，看也看見了，聽也聽到了，你能逃出歹人槍筒中的子彈麽？他的樣子，當眞很緊張的，這情形，他比我們旅客厲害百倍，因爲這輛車，就是他的全部財産，遇到胡匪，刧去他的馬匹，不但他，財産破了産，而且還斷絶了他的營生之路。</p>
<p>如果這時候聽到一聲槍聲，或是遇到五六個在一夥徘徊的人，那。誰都會嚇壞了的，可是我們終於一步一步走上嶺頂。</p>
<p>說實在話，我是不怕胡匪的，我是除了光身一人外，别無他物，我倒是很願看看他們，如果他們若是小隊活動的義勇軍，不是更好麽。一年前，抗日義勇軍曾在這裏設過防，確是個兵家必爭的險地，我盼望不久的將來、這裏再多出現些那般雄糾糾的武士們。</p>
<p>嶺頂有一座廟，除了初一十五兩個日子，開着門，此外總是把兩扇朱紅大門關得緊緊的。和尙，輕易也見不到面。遇到這樣的深山，這樣的險地，這樣的廟字，總不免令人想到是有個問號在着的。</p>
<p>廟對面，是壁立的山崖，路從中間通過，簡直像一個關口。往西口下去的路，比上嶺時還難走，不但嶺路很竣峭，並且很窄，這是全嶺上下頂難走的一段路。有時，駕轅的馬穩不住脚，滑一交，常常就翻了車，於是，車，馬，車夫，像一團亂石似地就滾滾到嶺下去。</p>
<p>每逢下嶺，旅客總是要下車的，走到山下才能再坐。</p>
<p>晚上，住嶺西三十里一家車店裏，聽說上半天當眞有一個辦貨老客遭了刦，店主人說這幾天以來，嶺上就有個小帮，約有五六枝小槍，他們不刦車，不刧窮客。那麽，他們是專往有錢人身上注意了。這麽說，也許我們過嶺時，他們正藏在林中呢，自然他們看淸我們的，他們不刦，也許是高抬貴手放過的吧？</p>
<p>車夫像被赦的囚徒似地，一邊喝着老酒，一邊笑着向我們幾個旅客要求道：</p>
<p>「老客，今天咱們算是走了好運，一會吃完飯買幾個甜瓜吃好不好？」</p>
<p>店主人有如他自己就是旅客，笑嘻嘻地說：　　「這個，自然，哈哈。」</p>
<p>旅客們也都陪着笑了一面就把右手伸到衣袋裏去掏錢，要完成這個瓜宴。</p>
<h3>不是槍彈所能消滅的仇敵</h3>
<p>— 美國民族週刊</p>
<h3>種甘薯</h3>
<p>— 蒲風</p>
<p>没有足够的土地，早稻剛剛割去，犂耙馬上就翻鬆了泥土；長年得不到休息，瘦瘠的田裏還要再種一季甘薯。</p>
<p>勾起了黄黑色的泥土，長長的土廂空出深長的路。放下了尺多長的薯苗，舖上了薄薄的肥料，立即又再加上一層土。</p>
<p>不斷地下苗，不息地舖灰，不停地壅土；一下一下鋤頭埋藏了多少汗珠？一根一根薯苗蓄下了多少辛苦？</p>
<p>萎頽的苗葉緊貼着泥土，淋下一桶一桶的水，也盼望老天的雨和露。不錯，許是明朝綠葉會有生氣顯吐，可是，誰担保三月後一定會有豐收？</p>
<h3>心理書法專家推斷吉凶</h3>
<p>— 吳紹熙</p>
<p>記得三四月以前，科學靈乩圖曾在上海哄動一時，那時各報都轟轟烈烈地加以攻擊，以爲迷信鬼藉着科學美名在那裏作古弄怪是應該驅逐的。</p>
<p>不料時過境遷，科學靈乩的鬼剛才趕走出去，又來了一個十分漂亮的美國敎授，那便是能看一人之書法筆跡而推斷其人之過去未來的心理書法專家任道敎授（profzandar），他現在駐節某飯店、正式與我上海人士相見，能够推斷變愛，婚姻，財氣，謀事，出門之吉凶，使知道有所趨避。</p>
<p>這事情可以引起人的注意，因爲任道先生是敎授，是心理書法專家，那末，自然是科學家，他的推斷，也當然比科學靈乩，更爲「科學」，更爲靈騐。</p>
<p>然而心理學告訴我們的事實與此兩樣，有少數心理學家雖也研究書法筆跡，但祇是想從書法中推斷人之性格，决無法推究吉凶禍福的。這種研究，現在還是一種萌芽，没有達到成熟的地步，也没有得到任何完全可靠的結論，甚至有些心理學家還在懷疑這種研究有成功的可能性。而現在竟有推波助浪超過心理學的範圍與能力之人，以爲由書法可推斷禍福，這是何等一件荒謬的事。</p>
<p>很顯然的，敎授與心理書法專家是騙人的頭銜，而實實在在祇是一個道地的江湖客—外國人的花樣，畢竟比中國人來得新鮮，江湖算命與敎授聯結起來，再加上商品化的餅干，三者便不愁不投合上海人的口味，或者有許多人會要受一次麻醉，然而心理學就遭殃了。</p>
<h3>弟弟（十二）</h3>
<p>— 周文</p>
<p>等到跑進他們的旅部的時候，他的同事們才說他被派着押送東西到省城丢了，明天就要回來。那些同事們早就知道我要往南京去的，以爲我將來一定是很有辦法的了。都來跟我周旋，說他們都是弟弟的好朋友。他們說弟弟人很小，人家都欺負他。他曾經被一個連長打過呢。他似乎很消極了。</p>
<p>第二天我還在弟弟的床上没有起來的時候，就聽見耳朶邊有人在呌着「哥哥」，我睜開眼睛來，幾乎不認得他是我的弟弟了。臉雖然還是那樣黑，然而己很瘦，顴骨似乎快要挺出來了。臉上己再不是從前的那麽粗獷，換上的是一付深沉的氣色。他望着我似乎很高興，然而却又講不出話來似的。</p>
<p>「弟弟，等了你一天了。」我翻起身來抓着他的手說。</p>
<p>「是呀，我趕回來了呢。」</p>
<p>「弟弟，你……」</p>
<p>正在這時候，有一個同事走進來，弟弟忽然就給我擠一下眼睛，似乎暗示我不忙說話似的。催着我洗了臉就一道出來。</p>
<p>在路上，弟弟向左右望了望才說道：</p>
<p>「那幾個傢伙跟你談過些甚麽没有？」</p>
<p>「談過，只是隨便談談。他說他們都是你的好朋友。」</p>
<p>「哼，好朋友！他們還不曾把我害得死。哥哥，你去了以後，我將來一定要來呢。這種事情眞不是人幹的，卑鄙齷齪！」</p>
<p>正講到這裏的時候，弟弟的肩頭忽被重重的拍了一下，隨着抛來一聲：</p>
<p>「哪裏去！」</p>

<h3>讀「接受遺産與整理國故」的疑問</h3>
<p>— 阿龍</p>
<p>昨日偶因便急，到厠出公，恰巧拿着「文學第三卷第三號」一書，便在厠所上細細地拜讀，我讀到「接受遺産與整理國故」一文，發現幾點疑竇，可是我接受遺産作家的朋友甚少，無從討敎，只得再寫出來，請敎請敎接受過文學遺産的作家，望華生勿再誤會，也說我爲洋八股，和别有用心吧。</p>
<p>這裏我先得聲明一句，我寫此文，並不是來參加戰團，也並不是故意來搗亂莊嚴的文壇，現在文壇上的作家，多是字脚很深的朋友，十分了不得的，所以文壇上作家的文章，我雖不象耶穌敎徒拿聖經當作寳劍一樣，但也象我國聖經賢傳一樣的重視，怎敢來參加和搗亂。</p>
<p>我開始讀了一第句，「自從今年年頭本刊提出文學遺産問題」例勃的一跳，眞是失敬的很，「文學遺産」原是貴刊首先提出來的，眞如瓦特發明蒸汽，哥侖布發現新大陸同一可貴，有人說這個名詞，是「羅宋」的來路貨，但總是先生煞費苦心，從外國接受下來文學遺産的一件寳貝，這且不表。</p>
<p>但我所不懂的，便是「遺産」二字，若照我輩愚笨的解說，假定祖宗死了，所遺下來的産業，便呌「遺産」，文學上的解說，想也未必例外，不過文學祖先的壽終正寢，和一般孝子順孫去接受遺産，其間必有一個段落時期，不知我國文學祖先的壽終正寢，是在那一年？承繼産權者的接受「文學遺産」，又不知在那一月？我實完全没有了解。</p>
<p>若根據政權系統來說，則中華民國成立，爲開始「接受文學遺産」時期呢，還是國民政府成立爲開始「接受文學遺産」時期？若以文學系統來說，則科舉廢除之日爲開始「接受文學遺産」時期呢，還是白話文運動之日爲開始「接受文學遺産」時期？還是大衆語高喊之日，爲開始「接受文學遺産一時期？其中段落」</p>
<p>時期，究在那裏？</p>
<p>還有一點，「文學遺産」與「整理國故」，到底有什麽分别呢？據華先生說，「所以我們提出中國文學遺産問題，不是企圖積極地指示什麽是遺産，是企圖消極地指斥什麽不是遺産。」據林嘯先生說：「文學遺産與整理國故」，又有什麽分别。」若照兩先生所說，名目雖有不同，而性質也無甚差别。但是我贊成「整理國故」四字，什麽理由呢？若拿「文學遺産」四字字面來看，「文學遺産」，是把祖先全部文學，統統接受下來，但遺産之中，金銀珠寳，天然接受，然而破檯子，破凳，破布頭，同時一併也在接受之列，並没有判别和抉擇的意思，非得華先生象朱夫子註書似的先來解釋一番，我們眞是莫名其土地堂。</p>
<p>若云「整理國故」，旣經整理，當然有重新支配，分别去取的意思，國故之中，有的當然要陳列博物院中去的，有的應該陳列各省圖書館，預備各地研究學術的人們去參考，有的當放到民衆敎育館去，使大家來研究。這就是「整理國故」的意思，西哲所謂重新批判，重行估價是也。而華先生必定說「文學遺産」是對，而「整理國故」爲非，不是先生别有用心，（借用先生語）尙有什麽道理？</p>
<p>還有一點疑問，華先生說：「楚辭是個總集的名稱，離騷不過其中的一篇，不應該說得這麽混統」。這兩句話，我與先生的見解，也有些不同，我在十餘歲時，一位戴老花眼鏡的李先生，講屈原列傳給我聽，講到「屈原疾王聽之不聰也，讒謟之蔽明也，邪曲之害公也，方正之不客也，故憂愁幽思而作離騷」。李先生講到這裏，便把眼鏡往額上一推，拍桌大駡昏君，並且他回頭鄭重地告訴我說，你不要誤會，所謂「離騷」，並不是僅指離騷一篇而言，是指屈原離騷總集的全部，因爲離騷是第一篇，故該書的全部，卽以離騷名之，後人又呌他楚辭，因爲屈原是楚國人，故呌他楚辭，其實楚辭並不限於離騷一書，卽如宋玉，唐勒，景差之徒，均是楚人，故他們的著作，也一併包括在内，離騷總集之卽名爲離騷，猶如學而八佾之僅舉首句中二字，爲全書的總名，我所聞於師說者如此。</p>
<p>後來我自己也來稍微研究研究這句文字，旣云「故憂愁幽思而作離騷」，可知並不是僅離騷一篇，是屈原憂愁幽思所作，而此外諸篇，非屈原憂愁幽思所作，其義甚明，試觀後面「太史公曰，余讀離騷，天問，招魂，哀郢，悲其志」，則以下諸篇，亦是憂愁幽思所作無疑，故後人竟有註此句爲離騷中之天問，招魂，哀郢者。其說雖未必是，而亦可通。而華先生必定說楚辭是總集的名稱，離騷是總集中的一篇，其主張旣如是堅决，註解又如此明白，因爲我到底没有接受過屈原文學的遺産，我亦不敢置辯，大約從前的學究先生，究屬靠不住，或者太史公亦是聞得好看見得平常的一位先生，不曾接受得屈原先生的文學遺産，有此誤會麽？這又是我的疑問。</p>
<p>總而言之，統而言之，外國的來路貨，究屬靠得住，文學遺産四字，任憑你張冠李戴，頭寸總是適合的，並且讀者一讀下去，何等新異可喜，若說整理國故，我一聽之下，便要頭痛，我奉勸明堂和林嘯兩先生再去多讀些書，不要瞎來嘵舌罷。</p>
<h3>秋憶</h3>
<p>— 炯女士</p>
<p>秋來了！</p>
<p>六十年來未有的暴熱，無踪無影的逝去，巳不復再生長在這人間。</p>
<p>和爽的天氣，雖然呌人興作舒適之感，但悲苦的心境，總不免又浮上了一層凄感之網呢！</p>
<p>風是陣陣的吹，無限的凉爽的氣息，舒適的襲進童年時代的稚心，菊花朶朶的開放着，有黄的，白的各種不同的顔色：蝴蝶兒雙雙的飛來飛去，在濃菊叢中。</p>
<p>秋來了，許多蟋　蟀埋藏在花草裏，不斷的發出秋秋的聲嚮，隱伏中誘惑我們去追求牠的踪跡。澄靑的池水，幽靜的，美麗的，秋風吹送着，起着一陣陣波紋，柳條倒映在水中，我們的漁船兒，飄飄的在水面上飛舞。那時候，正當我是七歲和敬弟是五歲的當兒，依稀的彷彿還記着那一年的秋天，父親遠奔省城，爲着公事的忙碌，竟連三載未得一歸呢！母親爲着太姊的出嫁，竟幾乎累得日不得空，夜不得寢的光景！我們一家人都說那一年的秋天，是一個破天荒的季節呢！只有毫無邪心的我和敬弟倆，依然過着無所事世的日子！每天，每天我們總是趁着這秋天的到臨，没有强烈的陽光，照着我們頭頂的時候，我們便躱藏在竹林裏，摸索着喞喞的在呌着的秋蟲的發源地。我們遍地去捕蟋蟀，但是蟋蟀聽到人聲　又停止了牠的呌聲，悄悄的隱伏起來。</p>
<p>今年的秋天，又如望的降臨了。</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>樹影疏淡的映在窗上，花草，一夜就變得那般的枯黄，晚風吹着，蟋蟀像是絶了跡，我飄泊在這塵灰的都市裏的八年中，已不復再聽到牠的哀呌！隨着逝水的流年，童年時的故景，竟都消散在年來故鄉的兵匪交亂中，决不能再呈現在我的眼前了。</p>
<p>秋月湧出了晶亮的素色，像會繫動一切魂魄便成宇宙幽沉，秋桐打在屋宇的週遭，和着秋風吹打在樹葉上，發出沙沙的聲嚮，跟着秋的暗影，那快樂的童年的心，早給頻頻的悲苦掩埋得那麽寂靜，假若再能從兒時的庭院裏，聽到一些秋虫的鳴聲，我想，我的心也要一樣的，只有微沉。</p>
<h3>秋窗雜感之一</h3>
<p>— 雋</p>
<p>—賣茉莉的姑娘—</p>
<p>跟着幾天雨，嫩凉的秋意便籠罩着人間了。</p>
<p>秋天帶來一些剛剛飄去的盛夏所没有的愉快，使數個月浸在西風裏的鬱悴的呼吸得以鬆一鬆；但同時也帶來一些盛夏所没有的淡淡的輕愁。和濃冽的悲哀。熱氣雖體着逝去的夏天和逝去了。却新添上心靈上一層厚厚的憂鬱感。</p>
<p>季候的秋和心境的秋呵！</p>
<p>秋天的時候也許還有戀的綠色葉的。然而在我的眼前可儘網着無邊的灰色。覺得身外的一切巳像漸漸地和我脫離，越見冷疏，仍下我在人的擁擠之孤島中孤單地生活着。</p>
<p>「秋天又來了，流浪者的心呵！」時常這樣對着陰沈沈的鉛塊似的天空低息着。低息一陣子，隨着感覺也銅塊似的壓上心來。每天，聽着下面弄堂街上囂雜的呌嚷，而在那些呌嚷的聲音中，有一支年輕的娘子的嘆息似的嗓子，「茉莉花阿要，茉莉花阿要」輕脆地傳進我的耳朶，就不由地步着同調在心裏邊暗語；</p>
<p>「秋天的茉莉花，流浪者的心呵！」</p>
<p>這麽深深太息着。</p>
<p>那賣茉莉花的年輕的娘兒，雖有如茉莉花一樣的靑春，却已無茉莉花一樣鮮麗的靑春的顔色。黯淡地，如一朶隔宵的將枯萎的茉莉。</p>
<p>呌了幾聲，便混在喧鬧的雜聲中消失了。而呌聲過後，却呈一種無聲的聲息停留在心坎上，縈迴着，和一個靑春的而又憔翠的影子一同地。</p>
<p>可是已是整整一年不見那影子那嘆息似的的聲音了啊！</p>
<p>可是這影子和這無聲的聲息亦永遠地嚙瘦着我的思念，像一條蟲，直到如今。</p>
<p>而以後，每天仍然倚着小小的窗口，瞧日光射在對面的高墻上，下午又沉下去。一切都是没變，只是没了那聲音，那影子。有時候偶然想起，便望望天上悠悠飛過去的雲流，蔚藍的天，沉在深長的回憶中，已是一年的日子了。</p>
<p>現在，太陽升得逕，落得早，秋天了。</p>
<p>賣秋天的茉莉花的年輕的娘兒，又無恙地出現在這些弄堂與長街之間。還是更嘆息似的嗓子，和更憔悴的影子。</p>
<p>秋天是再度把她催老了。</p>
<p>聽到了那太息似的嗓音，我的流浪者的感覺就越沉重着。覺得有一種游絲般的輕烟的惆悵，淡淡的籐纏着我的心：我的整個的靈魂。更從那裏惓念着一個幼小的悲哀的靈魂。隨着我流浪者孤獨地生活着，寂寂地過着日子。</p>
<p>聽到了那太息似的嗓音，一面爲着了人與人間的隔膜所憂鬱，同時又感到孤獨者被人不了解的親切的滋味。</p>
<p>秋天去了又來，來了又去。這樣地送着無數的秋天，在秋日的蟀蟋的落葉聲中聆着自己生命的落日跫鈴绖緻緻地飄了過去，飄了過去。</p>
<p>地主老爺說：「這是天不下雨，與我什麽相干！」</p>
<h3>秋的側面</h3>
<p>— 蕙人</p>
<p>工廠裏的汽笛在秋的寂靜的淸晨裏，狂也似的怒吼着，衝破了黑色的天空，透視着一片片疊着的愈白的雲霞，在東面的樹梢；朝風在那平坦的，發着光的柏油路上吹動從梧桐樹上掉下的葉子打着轉，聲息是異常的微弱。</p>
<p>人們縮着頸𩓐，一點没有精神的拖着笨重的脚步，踏着樹葉急快的，而又是乏力的，朝着在冒着黑烟的所在跑去。人們的面上還罩着一片惺忪彷彿的倦態，當從樹梢射下一枝暗淡的光綫時，就像抵抗不住的閉一閉眼；黄得像彫刻的石膏像一樣，差不多已失去了情感；女人們的頭上還保留着昨夜勞動的表記，是一層薄又帶黄的花絮，這些足以表示出他們的時間急忙，不容有稍少的機會來整理和修飾。</p>
<p>踏上了渡輪。就感覺到世界的沉寂，江水湧濤的冷酷，江風吹在臉上的陰凉，差不多一切都是死的一樣。在靜寂裏，人們腦海裏就湧着思想，回嚼着剛才還没做完的夢啦，更估計着自己的生活啦；但是這些，永遠在人們頭腦中成爲疑問的，祗變成一種無名的憤怒，像晨潮一樣的澎湃着。</p>
<p>他們意識到秋已到啦！是個殘酷的，無情的，而也是憤怒的，他們看不到秋的那面，那一面是温和的；歡樂的，動着的；正是像秋的那一面人們看不到秋的冷酷，無情，憤怒一樣。</p>
<p>他們是永遠地被隔開着，像有一座鐡壁一樣。</p>
<h3>孤寂的時候</h3>
<p>— 陸印全</p>
<p>到了枯井般的南京，心裏也便像枯井樣的岑寂了。躱在一間小小的亭子間裏，在澹闇的燈光的汎溢裏，怪寂寞的，我將做些什麽呢？過去，我曾經酷愛過孤獨，因爲牠底淡淡的甜鬱味，確是够人細細咀嚼的；但現在，我不但不歡</p>

<h3>Our Country Competes for a Seat on the League of Nations Administrative Council</h3>
<p>Ting</p>
<p>The September 18th Incident had just occurred. The Chinese government and public largely placed their hopes on the League of Nations. However, the four northeastern provinces remained unrestored. As a result, curses and condemnations arose, claiming that the League of Nations only catered to the powerful and offered no help in times of difficulty. However, in all fairness, the League of Nations remains an organization that advocates for justice. Having such an organization is surely better than the past state of international anarchy. Former US President Wilson once said that the world should not have a balance of power, but a common force. This was his ideal, which the League of Nations ideology was meant to foster. Since the latter half of the 19th century, the doctrine of free competition has also been overshadowed by the idea of collective mutual assistance. This idea is most clearly manifested in international organizations like the League of Nations. Based on this belief, China does not hastily change its initial commitment to supporting the League of Nations simply because of its weakness.</p>
<p>Given China's vast territory, large population, important international status, and firm support for the League of Nations, it is perfectly justified for China to assume a leading role in the organization. According to the League of Nations charter, the Administrative Council is the center of its power. Therefore, China's current competition for a non-permanent seat on the Administrative Council further demonstrates its spirit of not shirking responsibility and its deep regard for the League of Nations. Today, China is the country that has sacrificed the most for the sake of the League of Nations. However, the League's official ruling in February 1933, which was favorable to China, remains to be fulfilled. This shows that China's rights and obligations regarding the League of Nations are far from equal. China owes nothing to the League of Nations, but the League of Nations owes a great deal to China. China's ultimate goal is nothing more than to continue its efforts from the position of a council member, so that the League of Nations can fulfill its outstanding obligations as soon as possible, thereby restoring its declining prestige. Understanding this, it becomes clear that those who truly care about the League of Nations will surely support China's grand ambition to compete for a non-permanent seat.</p>
<p>The terms of the current non-permanent council members from China, Spain, and Panama are expiring. China's competitors are Persia and Turkey. Subsequently, Persia withdrew its candidacy to benefit Turkey. The Turkish representative's campaign statement stated: "Turkey now hopes for the council seat previously held by China... Turkey is indeed a European country... However, the allocation of council seats by continent is a tacit convention. The League of Nations Covenant does not stipulate this, so there is actually no legal basis." It is unknown that the League of Nations General Assembly had already passed a motion stating that "when electing non-permanent council members, the General Assembly's decision should endeavor to ensure representation for various geographical, ethnic, religious, and major groupings." Furthermore, the General Assembly has repeatedly stated that Asia should have sufficient representation on the Administrative Council. Therefore, Turkey, which spans both Europe and Asia, has little reason to compete with us. In the past, the scope of the League of Nations' work was often limited to a corner of Europe, and the major powers of Europe exclusively controlled the power of the Administrative Council and the Secretariat, which led to the League of Nations, which is related to the whole world, gradually becoming Europeanized. The world has many complaints about the League of Nations because of this. We deeply feel that it is necessary to expand the council members of the Administrative Council, and we also agree with the participation of Asian countries such as Persia and Siam. However, we cannot but strive to prevent others from taking our place.</p>
<p>We would also like to say a word to the Turkish authorities. If your country sincerely desires a seat on the Administrative Council, why not refer to Article 4, paragraph 5 of the Covenant, and strive for the consent of a majority of the member states of the General Assembly, in order to increase the number of non-permanent council members. In the beginning, there were only four non-permanent council seats. At the third General Assembly in 1922, it was decided to add two seats. At the seventh General Assembly in 1926, it was increased from six to nine seats. At the same time, the number of permanent council members also increased from five to six. Now that the Soviet Union is almost certain to be elected as a permanent council member, it is likely that it can join the League and participate in the current Administrative Council meeting after the majority of the General Assembly passes the resolution on the 10th of this month. In the past, when the number of permanent council members increased, the number of non-permanent council members would also increase accordingly. If this can be realized, then both China and Turkey would have the hope of being elected. Therefore, the authorities of the two countries should quickly work together for their common interests to promote the expansion of the Administrative Council. It is said that what Turkey hopes for is actually to obtain the chairmanship of the General Assembly. If this wish is fulfilled, it will automatically give up its candidacy. In that case, our country has a great hope of retaining its non-permanent council seat. Is it not possible to go one step further and seek to be elected as a permanent council member?</p>
<p>Japanese Cabinet Meeting</p>
<p>Formally Decides Naval Policy</p>
<p>Timing of Treaty Abolition Decided by Navy and Foreign Ministries</p>
<p>Disarmament Based on Principle of Difficult to Attack, Easy to Defend</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Today's cabinet meeting was held at 10:10 AM. All ministers, including Prime Minister Okada, attended. Foreign Minister Hirota explained the fundamental principles of disarmament, and Navy Minister Osumi also provided explanations. The entire cabinet unanimously formally decided on these principles and adjourned at noon. Prime Minister Okada immediately telegraphed Ambassador Matsudaira in the UK and other ambassadors abroad to convey the content. At 2:00 PM, he met with the Emperor to report on the content. (Jiji Press, 7th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At today's regular cabinet meeting, regarding the Japanese government's fundamental principles for the disarmament conference, after Foreign Minister Hirota and Navy Minister Osumi provided detailed explanations, Minister of Railways Tokonami questioned the disarmament and international relations for 20 minutes and asked Finance Minister Fujii about the relationship with Japanese finance. The Finance Minister replied and explained for about 10 minutes. Then, Commerce Minister Machida and the Finance Minister exchanged questions and answers regarding financial issues. Finally, Minister of War Uchida repeatedly questioned Navy Minister Osumi about specific figures, and the entire cabinet unanimously approved the three-page original proposal. The fundamental principles were established based on the following points:</p>
<p>(1) The notification of the abolition of the Washington Treaty has been decided to be implemented this year. However, the timing will be determined by Navy Minister Osumi and Foreign Minister Hirota.</p>
<p>(2) The fundamental principle of disarmament is to be based on the absolute and unshakeable principle of being difficult to attack and easy to defend. (Domei News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government's fundamental principles for the naval disarmament conference and the instructions for responding to the preparatory consultations have been formally decided at today's cabinet meeting. The fundamental principles are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Japan will submit a plan for thorough disarmament at the disarmament conference, break away from the unequal Washington and London treaties, abolish offensive weapons, and establish a self-determined holding capacity to establish the right to equal armament, create national defense security, reduce the national burden, and eliminate the three major goals of the threat of war.</p>
<p>(2) Japan will abolish the Washington Naval Treaty in accordance with the above fundamental principles.</p>
<p>(3) Japan will abolish the Washington Treaty and, in accordance with treaty provisions, observe the progress of preparatory consultations. Foreign Minister Hirota will carry out the procedures and issue a notification before October 21 of this year.</p>
<p>The draft instructions for responding to the preparatory consultations are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The 1935 conference should be held in London after April.</p>
<p>(2) The conference should not propose political issues such as the Far East issue, and the issue of fortress bases other than naval strength should not be the main topic of discussion.</p>
<p>(3) The method of restricting armaments should abolish the traditional system of distinguishing between types and classes of ships according to the principle of proportionality. The principle of total tonnage should be followed, and each country should agree on an equal maximum holding capacity according to this new principle of tonnage, and arbitrarily choose the type, number, and holding capacity of each ship within its scope. (4) The quality of battleships, aircraft carriers, and other auxiliary ships should be limited, as well as the ship type and gun caliber.</p>
<p>(5) Battleships and aircraft carriers should be completely abolished or thoroughly reduced.</p>
<p>(6) If the conference approves the above proposal, Japan can accept any kind of disarmament plan. The above instructions were handed over to Rear Admiral Yamamoto, the chairman of the delegation, who will depart for England on September 16. (Jiji Press, 7th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After today's regular cabinet meeting, Navy Minister Osumi said that today's cabinet meeting was more tense than usual because it was a decision on important state affairs, and there were repeated enthusiastic questions and answers, and the Empire's firm and unshakable principle for disarmament was thus produced. From now on, only affairs will be handled, so there will be no problem. As for the content of today's cabinet meeting, it was agreed not to say anything. However, Prime Minister Okada reported to the palace in detail yesterday and today, so if any situation occurs in the Empire's fundamental policy, it can be said that it will not be changed at all. (Domei News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Okada entered the palace yesterday afternoon to meet with the Emperor and reported on general government affairs, the progress and conclusions of the cabinet members' consultations regarding the fundamental principles of the disarmament conference, countermeasures for the London preparatory consultations, and the issue of the Washington Treaty. He then met with Chief Chamberlain Suzuki and Chief Military Aide-de-Camp Honjo, and returned to the official residence at 6:00 PM. After returning to the residence, he told reporters that he entered the palace today to report to the Emperor on general government affairs during his absence from Tokyo, the naval issue, and the issue of reforming the Manchurian organs. Political judgment does not need to be rushed, but there will be a clue in the coming week. After tomorrow's cabinet meeting, he will enter the palace again to report in detail on the decisions regarding the naval issue. (Domei News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The list of the delegation dispatched by the Japanese government to attend the London Naval Preparatory Consultations is as follows: Ambassador to the United Kingdom Tsuneo Matsudaira, Counselor of the Embassy Taisuke Kato, First Secretary Katsutaro Miyazaki, Second Secretary Denjiro Kato, Second Secretary Ritomo Akiyama, Chairman of the Naval Commission Rear Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, Captain of the Naval General Staff Masasuke Shimomura, Captain of the Naval General Staff Yasutaro Iwashita, and Military Attache to the United Kingdom Captain Shin Oka. (Jiji Press, 7th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Rear Admiral Yamamoto, the naval representative, was originally scheduled to take the Japanese ship Hakone Maru to England via the Indian Ocean on the 16th, but it has been changed to depart from Yokohama on the Hie Maru on the 20th, via the United States, and is scheduled to arrive in England in mid-October. (Jiji Press, 7th)</p>
<p>Russian Newspaper Denounces Japanese Rumors</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Manchurian State News Agency, known for spreading anti-Soviet rumors, recently issued a false report claiming that bandits who robbed a train on the southern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway had red badges on their arms with the Chinese characters "Friend of the Soviet Union." The Pravda commented on this, saying, "The Guotong Agency and other Japanese news agencies have engaged in anti-Soviet propaganda to the extent that they no longer care whether a rumor conflicts with other rumors. They have falsely claimed that the activities of the bandits were following a 'secret order' from some mythical 'Far Eastern Red Army Headquarters Guerrilla Department,' while another report claimed that the bandits' activities were not very secret and that they wore armbands with the words 'Friend of the Soviet Union.'" "We have a reasonable request for the Guotong Agency to explain why these 'Friends of the Soviet Union' would want to attack a railway train belonging to the sovereignty of the Soviet Union, and kill and kidnap Soviet citizens and their families to express their 'friendship'? In short, the reputation of the rumor-mongers of the Guotong Agency is not enviable, because their achievements are not worth mentioning." (Tass, 6th)</p>
<p>Polish Cabinet Rumored to Be Reorganized</p>
<p>No Change in Foreign Policy</p>
<p>Warsaw. Recent foreign reports suggest a reorganization of the Polish cabinet is imminent. Well-informed sources deny this, stating the cabinet is unlikely to be reorganized in the near future and Polish foreign policy will remain unaffected. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>Typhoon Hits the Philippines</p>
<p>Manila. Northern Luzon was struck by a typhoon, leaving over one thousand residents homeless. Damage is significant. (Havas, 6th)</p>

<p>Shift in European Alliances</p>
<p>France and Italy Join Forces Against Germany</p>
<p>Agree to Form Political and Military Pact</p>
<p>Empty Talk of Disarmament Offers No Benefit to European Peace</p>
<p>Rome. According to reliable sources, the Associated Press reports today that France and Italy have agreed in principle to form a political and military pact. This pact will completely change the landscape of European powers and replace the empty and indecisive theories of disarmament with a realistic dictatorship system for maintaining continental peace. It is reported that the scope of the understanding between the two countries is broad, fundamentally including the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Naval equality, (2) Armament equality, (3) Jointly reject German rearmament, (4) Political cooperation and consultation.</p>
<p>According to the current plans of French and Italian politicians, the Little Entente countries will also be included in this treaty. If so, then the European continent will have a standing army of 1.5 million people working together to maintain peace. The Associated Press has learned from reliable sources that French Foreign Minister Barthou's trip to Rome at the end of this month will be when the treaty is established. After the treaty is established, the issue of peace in Europe will be transformed from its previous form. Observers here believe that the disarmament issue, which has been unresolved for years, can be completely ignored, because both countries believe that empty talk of disarmament only makes countries prepare for war even more, so it is better to adopt a realistic policy. It is also reported that this treaty was the result of sudden changes in Germany and Austria, which led to diplomatic negotiations between Rome and Paris. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Rome Denies Military Alliance. Rome officially acknowledged this afternoon that talks between Italy and France are underway, but no agreement has been reached, and there is no issue of a Franco-Italian naval or land alliance. It is reported that progress has been made in talks between Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and French Ambassador de Chambrun regarding resolving the issues the Italians are unhappy with in the border case of French-speaking Libya. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Rome. The French Embassy in Italy issued an official statement here today, categorically denying that France and Italy have reached an agreement on naval equality, armaments, and opposition to German rearmament. Italian officials also denied the news that the two countries had concluded such an agreement. It is reported that Italy and France are currently preparing to seek a complete compromise on several outstanding issues before French Foreign Minister Barthou visits Rome at the end of October, but it will not lead to any agreement related to German rearmament. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Paris Believes the Time Is Not Ripe. The Associated Press in Paris reports that it is too early to say that France and Italy have reached an agreement, but it will be discussed further when Foreign Minister Barthou visits Italy at the end of September to determine a concrete plan. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>London Pays Close Attention. (London) Although Paris and Rome have denied the Franco-Italian agreement, European leaders are paying close attention to it, because if this kind of understanding is established, it can form a very powerful political unity in Europe. Reliable sources predict that French Foreign Minister Barthou and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will meet to discuss a common policy towards Germany and their attitude towards the naval conference. At the same time, they will also try to solve the difficult issue of the status of Italian nationals in French territories in Africa. France and Italy have had bad feelings about African colonies, and they have also been mutually jealous of each other's naval status. Now, this situation has changed greatly, because Barthou and Mussolini understand that the Nazi Party's attempts in Austria have the potential to endanger Italy. It is widely believed that a portion of the Franco-Italian naval understanding has already been established, so France can reduce its naval forces stationed in the Mediterranean and transfer warships to ports such as Cherbourg in the English Channel. Cherbourg port is currently being renovated. If the two countries' agreement is established in the future, the three countries of the Little Entente, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Romania, must be notified to dispel political and economic concerns. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Observations from Geneva. (Geneva) Diplomats in the League of Nations agreed today that the Austrian incident has worsened German-Italian relations and is likely to promote the conclusion of a political and military treaty between Italy and France. Well-informed sources also said that Britain and France's permission for Italy to act freely in Abyssinia is also the reason for prompting the Roman government to approve this plan. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Berlin Is Not Surprised. (Berlin) German political authorities today were unwilling to express their opinions on the final goal of the rumored Franco-Italian compromise. A senior official said that this treaty may lead to various countries accepting Italy's international disarmament plan or other proposals that are more favorable to Germany than before. Officials were not very surprised by the sudden rapprochement between Italy and France, because since the incident in Austria in July, Germany knew that it had long lost Italy's support and sympathy. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Air Defense Drill in Brussels</p>

<p>British Trade Union Congress</p>
<p>Resolves to Abandon General Strike as a Means of Anti-War</p>
<p>No Longer Forms a Common Front with the Third International</p>
<p>(London) At the annual British Trade Union Congress held in Weymouth, the issue of peace and disarmament was discussed today. The British syndicalist faction abandoned the method of opposing war with a general strike. A section in the general report of the Congress stated, "In the event of the danger of war, a special congress should be convened to decide whether industrial action should be taken to deal with it." When discussing this section, the debate was very intense. A minority faction advocating extremism considered this method to be "softening," while the drafters of the report stated various reasons to explain it. The majority of members expressed their agreement, so this section was eventually passed. Ernest Bevin, leader of the Transport Workers Union, declared, "Lord Privy Seal Baldwin once said that Britain should regard the Rhine as its border. We believe that Britain has no so-called border regarding international issues. Its only resolution mechanism is in Geneva." Several people then spoke, all believing that the dictatorship of leaking doctrine contained the danger of war. At this point, Trade Union General Secretary Citrine gave a speech to end the debate, which was greatly noticed by the audience. He said, "If Japan attacks Soviet Russia, do you think that the rules of the League of Nations can stop Japan? Do you think that all countries are determined to give the League of Nations the power to maintain peace? As I see it, if we must maintain peace internationally, first, there must be an organization that can resolve disputes in the event of international disputes, and second, there must be an international police force to make aggressive countries fearful. With these two, we can talk about maintaining peace." The General Secretary's views were approved by the public with cheers. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>(London) The annual British Trade Union Congress held in Weymouth decided, with all but two votes in favor, not to form a common front with the Communist Party again. General Secretary Citrine of the Trade Union criticized the Communist Party, saying that its intentions were not bright and that it had been trying to sabotage the Trade Union for several years.

<p>Debt Issue</p>
<p>US-Russia Negotiations Break Down</p>
<p>Long-Term Loans Rejected by the US</p>
<p>(Washington) The State Department announced today that US-Russian debt negotiations have completely broken down. A secret meeting was held with Soviet Russian Ambassador Troyanovsky last night, after which despair was declared. The State Department said that the United States has made concessions to the extreme in substance, and if it retreats further, the public interests of the American people will be sacrificed too much. It is learned that the meeting with the Russian ambassador last night was to revive the negotiations that had been suspended last month. According to Russian sources, the difficulty of the negotiations was the failure to agree on what kind of credit Soviet Russia should enjoy, rather than the amount of money Soviet Russia should repay to the United States. However, according to the State Department, the concessions in substance made some observers believe that the issue of compensation was not as smooth as the Soviet Russian authorities claimed. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The US-Russian debt negotiations have reached a stalemate because President Roosevelt has clearly rejected Soviet Russia's request for a long-term loan of 100 million yuan, and even the business advance payment is not allowed to exceed 200 million yuan. President Roosevelt informed the State Department that the amount of debt owed to the US by European countries that has not been repaid is already large, and it is not convenient to give long-term loans to any country.

<p>US Senate Continues</p>
<p>Investigating Arms Manufacturing</p>
<p>Reveals British-Made Submarines Sold to Japan</p>
<p>Netherlands Violates Treaty by Supplying Germany with Military Equipment</p>
<p>(Washington) The Senate Investigating Committee today continued to investigate the relationship between American arms manufacturers and foreign merchants. A witness testified about the British government giving the plans for K-type submarines to Japan. The correspondence between Carse, the general manager of the American Electric Boat Company, and Spear, the vice president, was read in court. Carse said in one of his letters, "I delivered a contract to Mitsubishi in 1916, stipulating a 10% commission on the gross price. Secretly, Mitsubishi did not fulfill this contract. It seems that we have been deceived by the British Vickers Company in Japan. I heard they told you that the British government has given the K-type submarine to Japan, so Mitsubishi believes that there is no need to proceed with our contract." The witness today also told the Investigating Committee about Spain purchasing submarines from Vickers. Carse sent a letter to Sir Zaharoff, the contact person of the American Electric Boat Company, explaining the situation of Vickers obtaining the Spanish deal. According to the explanation of the Electric Boat Company employees, the Spanish government owed the branch of the Electric Boat Company in Spain, and the branch in turn owed Vickers. Therefore, Vickers got this deal. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Senate committee investigating arms sales today reviewed contracts signed by the "Electric Boat Company" with major shipyards in Europe and Japan, similar to those signed by the British Vickers Company. It was found that in the regulatory committees of both houses of Congress, the company had put forward one person to join the Senate regulatory committee and two people to join the House Rules Committee for investigation. The committee also found out that the State Department had previously authorized the ambassador to Italy to assist the "Electric Boat Company" in accepting the Italian government's order for submarines, while at the same time taking into account the US government's policy on limiting armaments. The same contact was made with Turkey, but the result was unsuccessful. The committee also learned that the Dutch arms company manufactured military equipment on behalf of Germany, which violated the Treaty of Versailles. The Dutch company competed with the Electric Boat Company for the sales of military equipment. The means it used even stole the patent rights of the Electric Boat Company, so the Electric Boat Company had to invoke the Treaty of Versailles to resist it. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>US Will Launch</p>
<p>Movement to Increase Silver Coinage</p>
<p>(Washington) Well-informed observers here predict that officials may soon take action to increase silver coinage in most countries. After Professor Rogers returns to the country, the US government will proceed in this direction. Professor Rogers is returning from India after inspecting China and Japan. The White House has received many reports from him, but the final report must be handed over by Rogers in person. Government officials are gradually believing that the full development of expanding silver coinage in the US silver policy is very important. The so-called silver policy is an important part of President Roosevelt's recovery plan. The president has this view and is eager to conclude new agreements with foreign governments. According to reliable sources from the Associated Press, the State Department can conduct talks with Britain, France, and China at any time (National Telegram, 6th)</p>

<p>US Labor Strike</p>
<p>Workers Have a Significant Advantage</p>
<p>Clothing Union Joins Strike</p>
<p>(New York) The New York Women's Clothing Union voted today to join the textile workers' strike. It is expected that 50,000 people will strike immediately, and the number will increase to between 125,000 and 175,000. About 20,000 silk dyeing workers are said to join the strike on September 10. The situation is tense in many parts of the country, and the authorities are very worried. Armed national defense forces are preparing at various key points to be called upon at any time to suppress riots. There have been many clashes between textile workers on strike and factory guards. So far, ten people have died and 41 have been injured. 64 strikers have been arrested. According to independent estimates, there are a total of 360,000 textile workers on strike, but the union claims that it has reached 450,000. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The textile industry labor strike is becoming increasingly serious. Union leaders today predicted that an unprecedented national strike would occur in the United States. Gorman, chairman of the strike committee, claimed that if the factory and officials do not change their attitude, the union workers may take united action to support the textile industry workers, and other international unions will also join the textile industry strike, but it was not announced what kind of unions will join. There have been as many as 12 riots in large and small cities in the north and south, with ten people dead and 33 injured so far. However, the workers' attitude is still strong, determined to fight to the end. The most serious conflict occurred in the place of Honneyspice today. Six union pickets fought with workers against the strike at the Chiquola textile factory, killing six pickets and injuring 14. Workers against the strike were determined to resist the forced strike, armed themselves privately, and opened fire on the pickets when the pickets prevented them from entering the factory. The pickets had no weapons and were caught off guard, so they were extremely frightened and abandoned their corpses and fled. Riots also broke out in the textile industry centers of Georgia and North Carolina. The defense forces of North Carolina have been ordered to mobilize. One team of troops has set out for Mooresville, and another team has gone to Concord. The mayor of Spindale has also requested reinforcements. Conflicts between police and workers in Warren have resulted in the mobilization of defense forces to the area. The strikers are gradually gaining the upper hand. Today, it has become a universally recognized fact and has been verified by the Associated Press that there are approximately 350,000 strikers, compared to 300,000 yesterday. Sloan, president of the Textile Manufacturers Association, also admitted that the workers have an advantage. The Textile Industry Labor Strike Mediation Committee appointed by President Roosevelt is working hard and will summon a meeting in Washington for the first time. The President hopes that reconciliation can be achieved soon. Although the President himself has not participated in active negotiations, he is closely monitoring and is in contact with the mediators and Labor Secretary Perkins. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>

<h3>The Center of Turmoil in Eastern Europe (German Correspondence)</h3>
<p>The Relationship of the Three Emerging Small Nations</p>
<p>The Confrontation of Two Former Powerful Neighbors</p>
<p>Before the First World War, the powder keg of Europe was the Balkans. In the Balkan countries, there was endless conflict, caused by the opposition and struggle of ethnic minorities, which led to the power struggles of the great powers. The assassination in Sarajevo triggered an unprecedented war, as everyone knows. After 1918, the powder in the Balkans was exhausted, and everyone thought that everything was fine. However, in Central Europe, another powder keg was added. Austria and Hungary were the places where explosives were piled up, and they were also the places where Germany and Italy competed. However, Austria and Hungary still had some autonomy, and there was also the leader of the Versailles system - France - helping them from the side, or at least showing goodwill towards Italy. The difference in weight was too great, and it was not easy to ignite the igniter. Therefore, the seeds of chaos in Central Europe were not likely to explode immediately.</p>
<p>In addition to this, there is another dormant volcano in Europe that has the potential to cause a major disaster. This long-extinguished volcano is the three emerging small countries: Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. These three countries contain three types of ethnic minorities and are old countries that were restored after the Great War. Their total land area is only over 64,000 miles, and the total population is only over 5.36 million. The total population of Estonia is only 1,119,000, of which Estonians account for 87.7%, Russians account for 8.2%, and Germans account for 1.8%. The population of Latvia is 1.9 million, of which Latvians account for 73.4%, Russians account for 12.6%, Jews account for 5.2%, Germans account for 3.8%, and Poles account for 2.8%. The population of Lithuania is approximately 2.34 million, of which Lithuanians account for 83%, Jews account for 7%, Poles account for 4%, and Germans account for 1.5%. From this point of view, Germans are truly a minority among minorities. However, these Germans are the landlords in these relatively backward countries that are still stuck in the agricultural age, and they generally control the economic power. Therefore, in these three countries, some people give the German landlords a nickname, calling them Baltic Barons.</p>
<p>During periods of international peace and tranquility, these factors would inevitably cause problems, let alone now, when it is a time of many troubles and seeking troubles. Germany cannot immediately tear up the Treaty of Versailles, nor can it reach out to Central Europe, because it cannot immediately go to war with France and Italy, and the domestic discontent has nowhere to vent. As a result, it can only find another way out. This way out is the three small Baltic countries. Hitler himself and his subordinates believe that the Baltic countries are "the Balkans of Eastern Europe" and are the new territory of the Nazis.</p>
<p>Moreover, the current situation is that the confrontation between Germany and France is very acute, but Germany cannot abolish the Treaty of Versailles, take back Alsace-Lorraine, or merge with Austria. Even the Saar vote may not have sufficient certainty. Equality in armaments is also just empty talk. Then it can only find another route, inevitably drawing in Poland, with the intention of an eastward outlet. In theory, capitalism and socialism are incompatible. In fact, Germany is confident that it can compete with the Soviet Union. Diplomatically, it may be able to obtain the understanding of Britain, and France and Italy will not strongly oppose it. If it can really open up the road eastward, then Germany's current difficulties may be reduced somewhat, and the economic crisis may also be turned around.</p>
<p>However, the Soviet Union is not weak either. It saw the hidden dangers in the Baltic countries, so it first started by extending the non-aggression treaties with the three small countries for ten years. At the same time, it also proposed the Eastern European Locarno Treaty and invited Germany and Poland to join. After Germany rejected signing this treaty because it was safe for the time being, the Soviet Union fully exerted its diplomatic skills and restored relations with the countries of the Little Entente in the Danube River basin. Relations with France have also definitely improved. Although Germany intends to invade eastward, the road is blocked. This security network - the safety net distributed by the Soviet Union and France - is nearing completion. Germany certainly wants to break through it, but there are too few people to help, and the power of one country alone is too weak. Even with Poland, it is still not enough. Therefore, the three Baltic countries are ultimately a source of trouble and a place where major problems will occur between Germany and the Soviet Union in the future, i.e., the new powder keg of Europe.

<p>Victory in the Fifth Encirclement Campaign</p>
<p>The End of the Jiangxi Bandits Is at Hand</p>
<p>Various Groups Plan to Use Sichuan as a Retreat</p>
<p>Chiang Orders Strict Encirclement by All Units</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Since last year, when Chairman Chiang was stationed in Hubei to suppress the Red bandits, the various groups in Hubei were cleared, and the bandit nests on the borders of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui were gradually destroyed. Therefore, Chairman Chiang has been stationed in Jiangxi for a long time since last year to implement the fifth encirclement campaign. Since October of last year, the counties that have been recovered include Yongxin, Ninggang, Hengfeng, Lichuan, Zixi, Guangchang, Jianning, Taining, Liancheng, Shunchang, Jiangle, Chong'an, and Guangze. The bandit nests in eastern Jiangxi, northern Jiangxi, western Jiangxi, and northern Fujian are about to be wiped out. The remaining forces, such as Xiao Ke's pseudo-18th Army, have fled to Bin Yong in southern Hunan, hoping to bypass Sichuan and Guizhou. Fang Zhimin's pseudo-7th Army Corps has fled to the border between Zhejiang and Anhui to build a new nest. Luo Binghui's pseudo-9th Army Corps has also fled to the northeast of Fujian and the southwest of Zhejiang. There have long been rumors that Zhu De and Mao Zedong, who are confined to a corner of the Jiangxi-Fujian border, will take the Jiangxi-Hunan border to flee to the border between Sichuan and Guizhou. According to intelligence from the bandits and news from those familiar with the bandit situation, it is said that the suppression of bandits in Jiangxi has come to an end, and the Red bandits in Jiangxi have reached their end, just like when Xu Xiangqian and He Long retreated to Sichuan and Guizhou at the end of the suppression of Red bandits in the three provinces, which is to be expected. However, Chairman Chiang has already had a clear plan for this, and the military deployments in various directions are extremely thorough, and it is absolutely impossible for the bandits to realize their dream of entering Sichuan and Guizhou.

<p>Yan Huiqing</p>
<p>Passes Through Jinan to Qingdao</p>
<p>Talks About His Trip to Lushan and the International Situation</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Ambassador to Russia Yan Huiqing, after meeting with Chairman Chiang in Lushan with Gu Weijun, Gu went to Shanghai and took a plane to Qingdao. Yan took a train north from Nanjing. He arrived in Jinan at 8:00 PM last night (the 5th). After getting off the train, he rested at the Jiaoji Hotel. At 10:00 PM, he took the same car to Qingdao with Ge Guangting, Chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Committee. Chairman Han, various department heads, and committee members, as well as advisors Zhang Liansheng and Song Shiyan, the provincial government's representative in Jiangxi, all went to see him off. Before departing, a reporter interviewed Mr. Yan and asked about his trip to Lushan and the international situation. According to him, "I went to Lushan this time, accompanying Mr. Gu Shaochuan. In Lushan, I met Chairman Chiang, Huang Fu, Xiong Shihui, Wang Chonghui, Vice Commander Zhang, and others. Regarding diplomatic matters, I have already talked with Chairman Chiang before. I also accompanied Gu there this time. In addition to listening to Gu's report, I also briefly reported on the situation in Russia and Xinjiang. The date of my return to Russia has not yet been decided. I must go to the Peking Union Medical College Hospital for another physical examination. If my illness is not a problem, I will prepare to return to Russia. However, I still hope that the Central Government will select other capable people to take my place, because I have been abroad for nearly 20 years. I am really tired of foreign life, and there is no one at home to take care of me. It is okay to return to Russia for a short period of service, but I cannot maintain it for a long period of three to five years. The relationship between Japan and Russia is very tense, as reported in the newspapers. The key is still the issue of the Chinese Eastern Railway. I hope that it will not lead to a split. If one side does not use force, it is not very important. If force is used, a major war will break out, and it cannot be contained. The relationship between China and Russia is still good, and there is not much happening in Xinjiang. Since Hitler became president, the relationship between Germany and Italy has not been very tense. The international situation in Europe is tense, and everyone is actively preparing for war. Since the European War to the present, Europeans are immediately frightened at the mention of war, but the governments of various countries are still competing to prepare for war. However, the preparations are not sufficient, and the outbreak of a major war is not yet imminent. The assassination of the Austrian Prime Minister has made the situation very tense. The European War started from Austria that year, and now Europe is facing another change. Austria will become the fuse of a major war. China and Outer Mongolia only have trade in Zhangjiakou. Baotou has long severed relations with Kulun due to inconvenient transportation. When I was in Russia, I proposed that Russia resume trade between Kulun and Baotou. Russia declined, saying that Outer Mongolia is an independent country, and it is only possible if China and Outer Mongolia reach an agreement. I will stay in Qingdao for three to five days and then return west, returning to Jinan, then to Tianjin, and then to Beiping." (6th)</p>
<p>Songjiang Land Tax Embezzlement Case</p>
<p>Finance Department Investigates the Situation</p>
<p>Collection Director Ye Zongcheng Embezzles Over 100,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Detained in the Province for Questioning, Confesses Voluntarily to Repay in Installments</p>
<p>Zhenjiang News: The major case of Ye Zongcheng, the Songjiang collection director, floating and embezzling more than 100,000 yuan in land tax funds, was discovered by the Finance Department. The county was immediately ordered to detain him and was once detained in the province for questioning. He has now been sent back to the county for detention. A reporter learned the truth of the case from relevant parties and recorded it in detail as follows:</p>
<p>Cause of the Embezzlement: In the Punan and Pubei areas of Songjiang, there are tens of thousands of mu of discounted land. In order to take care of the people's difficulties, the Finance Department ordered that land tax be paid at a 40% discount. Later, the county reported to the department that the land was completely barren and could not pay taxes. Therefore, the department did not strictly inquire about it. Unexpectedly, the collection director and others fully collected from the landowners in the area from the 19th year, without any discount. Nothing was reported to the higher authorities. To date, the settlement is no less than 100,000 yuan. At a time when the provincial government is clarifying officialdom, the director dared to engage in such a major fraud, which can be described as daring.</p>
<p>Process of Exposure: Since the scale of the fraud case was so large, it could not be handled by one person alone. Disputes inevitably arose, and someone secretly reported it to the Finance Department. After receiving the news, Director Zhao immediately ordered the county to detain the director and sent personnel to investigate the matter. Che Zhao, the chief of the second section of the county, who was responsible for land tax, did not report a word about this case in advance. His negligence in his duties is obvious, or there may even be collusion in the fraud. The suspicion is very serious, and the county has been ordered to place him under house arrest.</p>
<p>Confession of Embezzlement: After Ye Zongcheng was escorted to the province, Yan Fang immediately sent personnel to interrogate him. The offender confessed to all the allegations and firmly believed that he was solely responsible for everything, and no one else participated. He was willing to fully repay the embezzled funds in installments, paying 50,000 by the end of October and the remaining funds by the end of the lunar year. After receiving the confession, the Finance Department ordered the offender to hand over the funds within a time limit and temporarily sent him back to the county for custody. It is reported that personnel will still be sent to the county for thorough investigation to determine whether there are any colluders. As for the land tax in the area, the investigation in Pubei has been completed, amounting to about 90,000 yuan. The investigation in Punan is still in progress, and the amount is not much, about 10,000 yuan. (6th)</p>

<p>Hurricane Likely to Strike Shanghai</p>
<p>Direction Unchanged, Arrival Expected Today</p>
<p>Ships from Fujian and Zhejiang Taking Temporary Refuge</p>
<p>Yesterday, various shipping companies in Shanghai received reports from the observatory stating that at 6:00 AM yesterday, a hurricane was located at 121 degrees East longitude and 26 degrees North latitude. The wind force at the center was 60 nautical miles, and the speed was extremely high, heading northeast. It had already approached the northeastern sea area of Fuzhou. There were also reports of strong cyclones in the East China Sea. Merchant ships sailing in the sea areas of Fujian and Zhejiang received warnings and many had already chosen shelter to prevent accidents. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's 同華轮 telegraphed yesterday that it had sailed to Taichow and anchored to avoid the storm, and would sail again after the hurricane passed. The 温州班轮 廣濟號 coming from 甌 to Shanghai was originally scheduled to enter the port yesterday, but received a hurricane warning en route. For safety, the ship sailed to Shihphu and anchored temporarily, postponing its arrival in Shanghai. The 海晏輪 sailing from Shanghai to 温州 also received a warning and sailed to the same area to take shelter with the 廣濟號. Consequently, all 温州 ferries were delayed by the storm, and arrival would be delayed by at least twenty-four hours. Merchant ships between Fuzhou and Shanghai were also navigating cautiously. The 南華 ferries and others had also chosen locations to anchor, waiting for the storm to pass before sailing to Shanghai. The 大美晚报 reported that in recent days, a hurricane had been lurking near Taiwan, its force particularly severe, causing great anxiety in the Shanghai shipping industry. This morning (the 7th), it showed signs of heading directly for Shanghai. According to the Pudong Observatory and hurricane experts at Xujiahui, the reason for its potential direct approach was that there were low-pressure zones on both sides of Shanghai, so the hurricane, like an angry horse, was being restrained by two reins, unable to move forward. However, there was a risk of the situation changing at any time, in which case the hurricane would turn east and take its usual path. Currently, however, it was still moving north. At 6:00 AM this morning, the center of the hurricane was located at 26 degrees North latitude and 121 degrees East longitude, that is, between Fuzhou and the northern part of Taiwan, in the north of the Taiwan Strait, about 300 miles from Shanghai. The current speed of the hurricane was 8 to 10 miles per hour. If the speed did not change, the direction did not change, and the storm did not dissipate or undergo other changes, then it would blow into Shanghai after noon tomorrow (i.e., today).</p>
<p>Members of Postal Associations</p>
<p>Work Returns to Normal</p>
<p>The mail had been slow recently with many accumulated items. The Shanghai City Party Headquarters, Municipal Government, and Social Affairs Bureau, recognizing the importance of postal services, convened representatives from the two postal associations yesterday morning at the City Party Headquarters. Commissioner Wu 开先 of the City Party Headquarters, Mayor Wu 鐡城, and Director Wu 醒亞 of the Social Affairs Bureau strongly urged the representatives to persuade all postal workers to work hard. It is reported that the representatives of the two associations have notified all members of the results of the talks, and have sent personnel to various post offices to provide on-site encouragement. The members were greatly reassured, and work returned to normal by 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>Yang Jie Departed for Beijing Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>General Yang Jie and a group of nine, formerly appointed to the European and American military inspection delegation, returned to China a few days ago on an Italian postal ship. After arriving in Shanghai, they were very busy with social engagements for several days. It is learned that Mr. Yang and others took the early express train to Beijing yesterday morning to meet with President Wang. They are scheduled to take a plane to Ganzhou this morning to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and report on the inspection trip.</p>
<p>Dai Jitao Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>No Specific Task, Returning to Beijing Next Week</p>
<p>Dai Jitao, President of the Examination Yuan, arrived in Shanghai by overnight train from Beijing at 7:30 yesterday morning. He went straight to his private residence to rest. Mr. Dai is taking advantage of his spare time to rest in Shanghai and has no other tasks. He will return to Beijing next week to resume his duties.</p>
<p>Kong Xiangxi Issues Important Statement</p>
<p>Absolutely No Prohibition on Silver Exports</p>
<p>Silver Bars Worth Ten Million Being Shipped to Sichuan</p>
<p>Liu Xiang Has Dropped Resignation Plans</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, returned to Beijing from Lushan a few days ago. On the evening before last, he took the overnight train from Beijing to Shanghai, arriving in Zhenru around 8:00 AM yesterday and transferring to a car to his private residence on West Ames Road for rest. Around 11:00 AM, he went to the Central Bank to work. Around 5:00 PM, he met with reporters from various newspapers and issued the following statement:</p>
<p>Absolutely No Prohibition on Silver Exports</p>
<p>According to Mr. Kong, rumors spread by malicious individuals claimed that the government was about to prohibit the export of silver or impose an export tax on silver, causing widespread panic and a large outflow of silver. In reality, the government has absolutely no intention of prohibiting the export of silver or imposing an export tax on silver. The truth is now clear to most people, and the quantity of silver exports has greatly decreased. It is expected that it will soon be shipped back to China. Mr. Kong also stated that finance is like the blood of the human body. Import and export should be allowed to occur naturally. Drastic measures should not be taken under normal circumstances, as this would damage credibility. However, this does not apply in emergency situations. The current silver reserves in Shanghai are less than 500 million, and about 290 million are held by domestically-owned banks. Therefore, it is hoped that the people will not be overly alarmed about the issue of silver outflow.</p>
<p>Remarkable Achievements in Abolishing Excessive and Miscellaneous Taxes</p>
<p>Mr. Kong continued that since the Ministry of Finance began vigorously abolishing excessive and miscellaneous taxes nationwide on July 1, the achievements have been remarkable, and the burden on people in various regions has been greatly reduced. As for the financial compensation for provinces after the abolition of excessive and miscellaneous taxes, there is actually no need to worry. The increase in excessive and miscellaneous taxes in various provinces and cities was improper in the first place. For example, if a certain provincial government builds a very luxurious building and needs a million dollars, it increases excessive and miscellaneous taxes because the provincial treasury has no funds. Such an improper increase in the burden on the people can certainly be abolished. Therefore, there will definitely be no problem with the financial revenue and expenditure of various provinces after the abolition of excessive and miscellaneous taxes.</p>
<p>Food Transportation and Sales Bureau to be Established Soon</p>
<p>Regarding the preparation of the Ministry of Finance's Food Transportation and Sales Bureau, various sectors have been contacted repeatedly, and it will be established soon. The current progress is that investigations are being conducted separately on the amount of food produced and needed in various regions. After the food purchase is established, it will be distributed based on the disaster situation in various regions. The transportation and sales aspects will be jointly handled with the Railways and Communications Departments. As for the organization of the Trust Bureau, Ye Zhuotang has been appointed as the director. The business scope of the bureau will be to operate trust businesses such as savings and insurance, but it will differ slightly from ordinary trust institutions. Regarding the issue of revising the Banking Savings Law, I have submitted it to the Executive Yuan for discussion in consideration of the difficulties faced by businesses. However, since the law was drafted by the Legislative Yuan and approved and promulgated by the Central Government, whether it can be amended in the future remains to be discussed.</p>
<p>Liu Xiang's Resignation Plans Have Been Dropped</p>
<p>Sichuan Bandit Suppression Commander Liu Xiang had previously requested to resign from the Central Government. Now, after the Central Government sent a telegram to retain him, his resignation plans have been dropped, and he will continue to be responsible for Sichuan's military and political affairs. The Sichuan provincial authorities had previously requested the Central Government to allocate silver bars worth ten million to be shipped to Sichuan as a guarantee for paper money because a large amount of silver was flowing from the inland to the cities, causing the rural economy to decline. The Central Government has approved this, and it will be shipped to Sichuan soon. The rumor that Sichuan requested one million in military funds for bandit suppression is actually a misunderstanding. Regarding the issue of the election of representatives from the four northeastern provinces to the Fifth National Congress, when reporters asked Mr. Kong about this, he replied that the matter should be discussed by the Organization Committee of the Central Party Headquarters. The election of representatives from the four provinces to attend the Fifth National Congress may begin with an investigation into the number of party branches and party members in the four provinces in the past, and then a method of election will be discussed. Whether the representatives will be appointed by the Central Government has not yet been decided.</p>
<p>Planning to Inspect Finances in the Southwest</p>
<p>Mr. Kong has decided to travel to the Southwest during his spare time from official duties to inspect the financial situation of the provinces. He has not been assigned any missions. The date of departure has not yet been decided. Mr. Kong also plans to travel to Sichuan, Gansu, Yunnan, and other provinces after inspecting the Southwest.</p>
<p>Huang Fu Met with Reporters Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Scheduled to Enter Beijing Next Week</p>
<p>Details of Jiangxi Province's Achievements as an Example for the Country</p>
<p>Restoration of Order in North China Cannot Be Said to Have Made No Progress</p>
<p>Huang Fu, Chairman of the Executive Yuan's Peiping Political Reorganization Committee, went to Lushan last month at the invitation of President Wang and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to discuss political affairs. He returned to Shanghai on the YongSui warship on the evening of the 6th. He met with reporters from various newspapers at his private residence at 10:00 AM yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Issued a Written Statement: "I went to Lushan on the 8th and 10th at the invitation of President Wang and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. I originally planned to return in a week, but Chairman Chiang Kai-shek felt slightly unwell after intense work in the hot summer, so I stayed in Lushan for a while. Now, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's health has fully recovered, and he is personally handling political affairs as usual every day. During this period, I took the opportunity to inspect the bandit suppression work in Jiangxi Province and the political reconstruction after the recovery of the bandit areas. I feel that all the staff of the various agencies are persevering, hardworking, and devoted to their work, handling a large amount of affairs with a very small number of personnel. Therefore, all work is very tense, sweeping away the previous lax atmosphere. This is the most worthy of emulation by public officials in various places. Regarding political affairs in North China, Director Yin is now returning north to resume his duties, and the war zone reorganization issues will soon be addressed one by one. In short, after a major war, the wounds have not yet healed, and the people's strength has been depleted. Reorganizing political affairs and restoring order is not easy. Judging from the current situation, it is certainly not entirely satisfactory, but compared to this time last year, it cannot be said that there has been no progress."</p>
<p>Jiangxi Province Has a Complete System</p>
<p>Mr. Huang then replied to questions from the reporters, stating: "I spent a lot of time in Jiangxi, so I used my spare time to inspect the political situation in the province. Jiangxi Province is a bandit area, and North China is a disaster area, so there are many things that can be observed and emulated. The results of the inspection show that public officials in Jiangxi Province are able to focus on their work. The system in Jiangxi Province has been extensively studied and is now extremely complete. The province's governance is unified, so progress in politics and savings in expenses are evident. I believe that this system is worthy of emulation by all provinces in the country, so I have copied a copy of the province's laws, regulations, and detailed rules for officials in North China to refer to and emulate after I arrive in Peiping."</p>
<p>Reorganization of North China</p>
<p>Regarding various issues in North China, I also discussed them with President Wang and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Lushan. The reorganization of the disaster area will begin, but in terms of environment and reality, the progress is difficult. It should be done step by step. The reorganization of political affairs in North China will also be carried out gradually. Mr. Huang continued that the economic strength of Europe and other countries is much greater than that of China, but even there, the restoration of vitality in war zones has not been rapid.</p>
<p>Returning North in One Week</p>
<p>Mr. Huang continued, "This return to Shanghai is to take care of family matters. I plan to stay for a week, then enter Beijing to visit President Wang, and then return north to resume my duties. As for the rumors that the Sino-Japanese issues in North China are difficult to resolve, this is just speculation. Any issue depends on one's own efforts. For example, if a person has a sore on his hand, the blood cells in his whole body will be mobilized to resist it, and the body will recover."</p>
<p>Ten Thousand Bags</p>
<p>Saigon Rice Arrived in Shanghai the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>Prices Continue to Fall in Both Northern and Southern Rice Markets</p>
<p>大公社 reports that the first batch of 100,000 bags of Saigon rice ordered by Shanghai rice merchants and banks for the September term arrived in Shanghai on an foreign ship on the morning of the 6th and were unloaded at the Yangshupu Wharf. Rice merchants and banks that had ordered the rice all went to the managing foreign firms such as 達孚, 泰隆, 公和, etc. yesterday to pick up their goods with their order receipts. September term Saigon rice was valued at $11.7 per bag, calculated at 180 catties per Sima scale. When converted to 150 catties per new Shanghai 市斛, each 石 is only within $10. Therefore, the goods that arrived in Shanghai this time had already been sold. There are still 400,000 bags for the October term, scheduled to be loaded in Shanghai at the end of this month.</p>
<p>Prices Continue to Fall in Both Northern and Southern Rice Markets</p>
<p>The rice boats from various rice merchants arriving at the rice markets in the north and south have been carrying new rice in recent days, and old rice has become relatively scarce. Recently, because there were more reserves of rice in various places, the highest price of rice transported to Shanghai from the interior has fallen to within the $13.5 limit price. The secondary-grade rice is around $12 and $11. After the morning rain in Shanghai yesterday, the prices announced in the market fell again by two or three cents. According to the observation of the rice industry, after all the foreign rice arrives and the late rice comes on the market, the price of rice will definitely experience a special decline.</p>
<p>Jiangxi Province Tribute Rice Shipped Back to Shanghai</p>
<p>Previously, Jiangxi Province experienced a drought and famine this year, and rice prices soared, causing panic among the people. In order to provide relief, the provincial government ordered the Jiangxi Yumin Bank to purchase 10,000 bags of tribute rice in Shanghai and transport them to Nanchang and Jiujiang for flat sales. Now, the province has received a lot of grain from neighboring provinces, and the price has plummeted by about three dollars per dan. However, the price of rice in Shanghai is still strong, so it is planned to ship 5,000 bags of tribute rice stored in Jiujiang to Shanghai for sale in order to regulate the supply and demand of grain. According to Shanghai rice industry sources yesterday, some of the rice has already arrived in Shanghai, and the remaining amount will continue to arrive within the next week.</p>
<p>Telecommunications Personnel Return to Shanghai</p>
<p>The National Telecommunications Conference convened by the Ministry of Communications in Beijing concluded on the 6th. Bao Keyong, Director of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, Yu Runsheng, Chief Engineer, Hua Shijian, Chief of the Reporting Section, Xu Xueyu, Director of the Telephone Bureau, Yu Bingjian, Chief Engineer, and Wen Yuqing, Director of the International Telecommunications Bureau, all left Beijing for Shanghai after the closing ceremony.</p>
<p>Last Batch Arrived Yesterday</p>
<p>American Wheat</p>
<p>318,968 Tons</p>
<p>Fully Shipped in Seven Months and Twenty Days</p>
<p>The last batch of American wheat purchased on credit, transported by the スカリーで号輪, totaled 6,300 tons, worth US$6 million, and arrived in Shanghai yesterday. It is now being unloaded at River Wharf Nos. 12 and 13. The American wheat loaned began with the first batch of 8,940 tons by the 亚力佛倍克 on December 18 of last year, and it has taken seven months and twenty days to fully ship it. The total number is 318,968 tons, all of which has been sold. The average selling price per ton is 70 yuan. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company chartered 23 ships to transport it, totaling 183,386 tons.</p>
<p>Chen Zhiming Arrived in Shanghai from Australia</p>
<p>华东社 reports that Chen Zhiming, the representative of the Australian branch to the Fifth National Congress, arrived in Shanghai from Australia yesterday morning on the Nanjing ferry. He is staying at Room 315, Dadong Hotel, Nanjing Road. After arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Chen took the Shanghai-Hangzhou train to Hangzhou that evening to visit the scenic West Lake. After staying in Hangzhou for about three to five days, he will go straight to Beijing via the Jing-Hang Highway.</p>

<p>New Aircraft Scheduled to Fly to Beijing</p>
<p>To be Flown to Beijing for Senior Central Figures to Test Ride</p>
<p>All Staff Held a Gathering Yesterday</p>
<p>-Celebration of Successful Long-Distance Flight to be Held Today-</p>
<p>华东社 reports that a large Junkers JU-52 aircraft recently purchased by the Eurasia Aviation Company had flown from Berlin to Shanghai and is currently staying at the Hongqiao Airport. General Manager Li Jingcong has decided to hold a banquet at the Dadong Hotel at 7:00 PM this afternoon to celebrate the successful flight of pilot Gebelenz, etc. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Yesterday's Gathering</p>
<p>After the aircraft arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, the chief pilot Gebelenz and his party stayed at the Cathay Hotel on the Bund. At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, Mr. Gebelenz and others visited the Eurasia Company. All staff of the company, led by Li Jingcong, held a dinner gathering at the Dadong Hotel on Nanjing Road at 6:00 PM last night. Mr. Li introduced the guests one by one, and there were no outside guests accompanying them.</p>
<p>Celebration to be Held Today</p>
<p>To celebrate Chief Pilot Baron Gebelenz, Deputy Officer翁托特, etc., the company has decided to hold a banquet at the Dadong Hotel at 7:00 PM this afternoon. German Minister陶德曼, Mayor Wu 鐡城, Director Yang Hu of the Municipal Security Department, Chairman Yu Zuoting of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Lin Wo of the Aviation Association, Manager Dai Enji of the China Aviation Company, and members of the press have all been invited. It is expected that there will be a lively scene.</p>
<p>Flying to Beijing on the 12th</p>
<p>According to Mr. Zha Zhenwu, secretary of the company, the aircraft is still staying at the Hongqiao Airport. Manager Li believes that the aircraft is a novelty in China, so he has decided that Mr. Gebelenz will fly to the capital on the 12th of this month (next Wednesday) and invite senior officials from various ministries and departments of the Central Government to ride the aircraft for a tour around the capital.</p>
<p>Li Jingcong's Remarks</p>
<p>According to Mr. Li Jingcong, today's (the 7th) report on the arrival of the company's new aircraft in Shanghai was not very detailed. The wings of the aircraft are different from ordinary aircraft and are installed under the fuselage. Even when fully loaded with 3,500 kilograms, it only needs to travel 270 meters on the ground to take off when the wind is calm. After taking off, the speed of flight in the air can be increased to 260 kilometers and 300 kilometers per hour with the help of this auxiliary wing. When landing, the speed of flight can be reduced to only 65 kilometers per hour, so even when fully loaded, the aircraft only needs to continue for 180 meters on the ground after the wheels touch the ground to stop completely.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Tianjin Shipping Industry Reaches Agreement</p>
<p>Warning to Fuxin and Fuji</p>
<p>Regarding the Reduction of Freight Charges for the Songshan Maru</p>
<p>新声社 reports that after 21 companies, including the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the privately-run Sanbei Company, implemented cooperation and organized the Shanghai-Tianjin Shipping Association, the British companies Taikoo and Jardine signed agreements with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to join the cooperation. Freight rates and rebates for goods between Shanghai and Tianjin are completely unified and public. Now, the Fuxin Flour Mill, a Chinese company, entrusted the Fuji Customs Brokerage to transport 80,000 bags of flour to Tianjin on the Japanese company Nisshin's Songshan Maru. According to the association's regulations, the freight rate is 18 cents and the handling fee is 14 cents, totaling 32 cents. Today, Nisshin reduced the freight and handling fees to a total of more than 20 cents, which aroused the public anger of Chinese and foreign shipping companies. The member shipping companies of the association decided to hold a meeting yesterday: (1) The Shanghai Shipping Association will send a letter to the Fuxin Flour Mill to warn it; (2) The Shanghai Forwarding and Customs Brokerage Association will send a letter to the Fuji Customs Brokerage to warn it. An emergency meeting is scheduled to be held again today to discuss countermeasures. The situation is very serious.</p>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Four New Ships</p>
<p>Decision to Use Chinese Captains</p>
<p>First Ship Expected to Arrive in Shanghai by the End of October</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's four sea liners being built in the UK, 海元 and 海亨, have been launched. According to a telegram from Wu Daming and others, the deck and other items are being installed. They will not be completed by the middle of this month, so it is estimated that the first ship, 海元, will not be able to leave the UK until after the 20th of this month. The earliest date of arrival in Shanghai is at the end of October. 海亨 will arrive in Shanghai at the beginning of November. The captains of all four new ships have been inquired about in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Customs has no restrictions on the use of Chinese shipowners for passenger ships as long as they are qualified. Therefore, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has decided with Chief Captain Shen Jiyun and the Ship Department to appoint Chinese captains for the four sea liners. The arrangements are currently being discussed and will be announced next month.</p>
<p>Pan Xulun Returned to Shanghai from Hunan the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>Talks About the Progress of Hunan Province's Construction</p>
<p>Hoping for Investment from Financial Circles in Other Provinces</p>
<p>This year, the China Economic Society held its 11th annual meeting in Changsha and also inspected the economic construction of Hunan Province. The Shanghai members of the society who went to the meeting included Pan Xulun, Li Quanshi, Sheng Zhuosan, Tang Qingzeng, Zhuang Zhihuan, Jin Guobao, and more than 20 others. It is learned that Mr. Pan Xulun returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday due to pressing duties. Mr. Pan told visitors yesterday:</p>
<p>"I went to Changsha with my colleagues from the Economic Society to attend the annual meeting and was invited by Chairman He of Hunan Province to visit the new policies and the achievements of social enterprises in the Changsha area. I would like to briefly mention them for the benefit of those who care about provincial administration and entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Since He Jian, Chairman of Hunan Province, eliminated the communist disaster and presided over Hunan's administration in the spring of 1930, he has been able to gradually bring Hunan Province into a state of peace and order in four or five years. Mr. He has been able to lead by example in political measures and has worked hard to carry out various constructions, so he is deeply loved by the people of Hunan. Although he holds military, political, and party power simultaneously, he feels no officialdom, enters and exits freely, and eliminates escorts. On the one hand, he actively promotes culture, improves education, promotes industry, and conducts statistical surveys. The provincial government has published about 40 or 50 publications on Hunan's statistics, such as the Hunan Yearbook, the Hunan Economic Research Institute Series, the Hunan Population Statistics, the Hunan Price Index, etc. Under the personal promotion of Chairman He, the item of national martial arts has developed very commonly. When we visited the National Martial Arts Club, we saw that the performers included male and female primary and secondary school students, soldiers, and ordinary ladies from all walks of life. Chairman He and the directors also sat among the crowd to watch. Chairman He himself is proficient in national martial arts and entered the arena to perform. Such a civilianized and admired official is a model for military and political authorities. As for the spirit of Hunan's officials at all levels, judging from what I have seen in the past few days, there is very little officialdom. All officials are able to take the lead and operate on their own, which is truly rare.</p>
<p>Hunan Education has always been known for its development. In recent years, Hu Shuhua has been running Hunan University. He only spends 20,000 yuan a month from the province, but the achievements of his departments are better than those of national universities that cost 60,000 to 70,000 yuan a month. As for social education, the degree of development is actually better than that of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Beijing, and Shanghai. At the invitation of the Education Department, our company gave public lectures at the Zhongshan Hall in Changsha on economic issues and accounting improvement. Each session was full, with no less than 1,000 to 2,000 people. When our company gave public lectures elsewhere, there were never so many listeners. This shows the high level of education among the general public in Hunan and their special concern for social and economic issues.</p>
<p>According to what Chairman He said about Hunan Province's trade situation, imports exceed exports by as much as 1.8 million yuan per month. The largest items are gasoline and cigarettes, so the way to remedy the excess of imports is to start from here. The Hunan Provincial Industrial Experimental Institute has invented the use of alcohol instead of gasoline, and all public and private groups have risen up to advocate not smoking cigarettes. Everywhere we went, we saw signs on the walls saying "Sorry, no smoking," and government offices and party branches posted "Smoking is prohibited." As a result, in fact, there are far fewer smokers in Hunan Province, and the amount of cigarette imports has greatly decreased in recent years. Hunan is seeking to offset the trade deficit by starting with replacing gasoline and not smoking cigarettes, which has a huge effect. It can be seen that everything only needs to be done practically, and it is not difficult. The most valuable new invention in Changsha's industry is the alcohol car. This matter has been successfully tested by the Provincial Industrial Experimental Institute. By slightly adding special devices to ordinary cars, alcohol can be used instead of gasoline as fuel. During my week-long stay in Changsha, all the cars I rode in burned alcohol. All the situations such as starting, driving, and stopping the car were not inconvenient in the slightest. Two or three years ago, Hunan invented charcoal cars, but using charcoal as fuel was still inconvenient in many ways. The fuel took up too much space on the car, and it was not clean, and it took time to start the fire, and the power was slightly lower. Now, replacing gasoline with alcohol can avoid all difficulties. Now, when my country is developing highways and promoting aviation, the value of importing gasoline in a year is shocking. Hunan can replace gasoline with self-made alcohol, and its importance to the national economy and national defense is difficult to express in words.</p>
<p>In addition to the existing spinning mills and machine factories, the new organizations in Changsha's industry include zinc smelting plants, glass factories, and paper mills, all of which are promoted by the provincial government allocating provincial funds to start them. All glass appliances are very exquisite and are definitely sufficient to resist imported goods with a surplus. As for the paper mill, it has recently started construction, and because of the abundance of nearby raw materials, the results must be good. However, the capital of each factory is small, with the largest being 200,000 and the smallest being 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. With this opportunity to develop industry, I only hope to concentrate the huge amount of funds in Shanghai and invest a small amount of several million yuan in Hunan to manage it, and the public and private sectors will benefit, and the results will be seen immediately. I deeply hope that Shanghai capitalists will pay attention to this opportunity.</p>
<p>In addition, Chairman He has spared no effort in the scenic construction of Hunan Province. The members of our company were invited by the provincial government to visit Mount Heng. Mount Heng is the first scenic spot in Hunan Province. The situation is majestic. The provincial government has set up the Mount Heng Management Bureau to actively engage in road repairs, afforestation, and sorting out famous monuments and historical sites. It has already achieved remarkable results. The mountain is more than 3,000 feet high, and the climate is very cool in summer. It is developed as a summer resort and is comparable to Lushan and Mogan. The annual meeting of our company coincided with the hot summer. As soon as we entered Mount Heng, we felt cool. I think the Yuehan and Yupi railways will be built in the near future. It will only take two days to go to Mount Heng from Shanghai and Guangzhou. At that time, those who go to visit will definitely follow each other."</p>
<p>Railway Bureau Periodically Receives Merchants</p>
<p>Explanation and Observation of Cargo Transportation Procedures</p>
<p>The Jinghu and Huhangyong Railway Administration plans to cooperate with producers and sellers on the principle of fairness to seek mutual benefit, further extending its effectiveness to regulate supply and demand and develop the national economy. Shanghai is the main center of production and sales. Representatives of various important industries in the city have been invited three times, on August 22 last year, February 8 and July 16 this year, to discuss cooperation. On June 9 this year, they also participated in the China National Products Production and Sales Federation to report on the hope of cooperating with both producers and sellers. Recently, in consideration of various opinions, the general outline of cooperation methods for production, transportation, and sales at stations along the line has been stipulated. One of the provisions is "In places where there are large quantities of goods produced and sold, special personnel will be dispatched to guide or handle transportation procedures." In addition to handling transportation procedures, business offices have been established in Shanghai Jing'an Temple Road, Shiliupu, and Nanjing Taiping Road, specializing in this matter. Other important stations will continue to be established. Regarding the guidance of transportation procedures, although some people have been sent to various places to explain to the industrial and commercial circles and publish regulations for reference, the procedures and calculation of freight are still not easy to understand. In order to solve this difficulty, the railway bureau first contacts important companies, factories, and stores in Shanghai and asks them to send personnel who handle the transportation or equivalent personnel. The railway bureau divides them into several classes to give detailed explanations and on-site observations on all current railway transportation methods and freight calculation methods. The location is at the Shanghai North Station, and there is no charge. The first class is tentatively set at 40 people. The training period is limited to two weeks (from September 17 to 30, except Sundays, from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM every day. At other times, you can still work in various companies, factories, and stores). The railway bureau has sent this plan to various companies, factories, and stores and asked them to notify the selected participants with a letter before September 15.</p>
<p>Cotton Should Be Inspected at the Place of Origin</p>
<p>Statement from Two Cotton Organizations in Hankou</p>
<p>The Hankou Cotton Import Industry Association and the Cotton Firm Industry Association sent a telegram: "To the Legislative Yuan, Executive Yuan, Ministry of Industry, National Economic Committee, and Cotton Control Committee: The malpractice of cotton adulteration is too deep-rooted. To seek elimination, the first thing to do is to treat the root cause. Treating the symptoms instead of the root cause will be a burden on good governance, even with good laws and intentions. In recent years, the government has implemented inspection to improve the status of domestic cotton. The legislation is not very good, but because it has failed to treat the root cause, cotton merchants have suffered greatly for several years, and the effect is very limited. Now, in order to quickly eliminate the malpractice, the Interim Regulations on Prohibiting Cotton Adulteration have been promulgated. The government believes that the implementation of these regulations will eliminate the malpractice and restore the cotton industry. However, the regulations, no matter how strict, will only punish the innocent while the perpetrators will still be at large without any scruples.</p>

<p>Songjiang</p>
<p>Supervisory Committee Member Investigates Land Tax</p>
<p>The Central Supervisory Yuan sent an investigator, Gu Fengxiang, to Songjiang. This morning (the 6th) at 8:00 AM, he went to the county government where County Magistrate Jin Yan received him. It is said that his mission is to investigate land tax in this county, including the conversion of land tax into grain for transport. The investigation was very thorough. He left the county government after several hours of investigation. It is said that Mr. Gu has been in Songjiang for many days, secretly consulting with various parties, for more than a day.</p>
<p>Suzhou: Jin Shuren Recovers from Illness, Case Awaits Trial</p>
<p>Former Xinjiang Province Chairman Jin Shuren, due to being ill while in custody, was sent to Nanjing Central Hospital for treatment with the approval of the Suzhou High Court. He has now recovered. Yesterday (the 7th), the presiding judge of this case at the High Court, Lu Wenlan, ordered the Jiangning District Court to return Jin for trial, so that a date can be set for the continued hearing.</p>
<p>Opium Pill Suspect Arrested in Suzhou</p>
<p>Opium Pill King Li Wenxiang of Wuxi, established an opium pill operation at Dongxin Bridge outside the North Gate of Wuxi. After the case was discovered, Li Wenxiang fled to Suzhou and hid at his relatives' place. The Wuxi Public Security Bureau's Second Sub-bureau learned of this and sent Detective Yu Wensheng to Suzhou to investigate secretly. On the evening of the 6th, Li was arrested at No. 15 Xinxin Hotel outside the Chang Gate and taken to the relevant police district. Yesterday (the 7th), he was transferred to the General Bureau to await Wuxi County to send personnel to Suzhou to escort him back for trial.</p>
<p>Thorough Investigation of Land Tax Fraud</p>
<p>The Wuxian land tax fraud case, which has attracted attention from all parties, has led the Department of Finance to send Committee Member Dong to Suzhou for a secret investigation. The investigation of the unauthorized collection has been completed, and the fraud has been confirmed. The registrar Qian Zhonghua has been placed under surveillance pending investigation. Currently, the investigation of historical arrears and land reclamation is underway. Committee Member Dong is determined to conduct a thorough investigation, so he investigates each household, without minding the trouble. However, Wuxian County has a vast area, with more than 1,040 map divisions, 1.81 million mu of land, and more than 600,000 grain households. It may be impossible to complete the investigation in a short time. A thorough investigation may take three to four months, so it is not known when this case can be concluded. As for the unauthorized collection, the abuses are deeply rooted. A thorough investigation will involve hundreds of people, including the surveyors (i.e., tax collectors) and tax evaders from each map division, which may lead to a major case. Committee Member Dong will go to the provincial capital in the next few days to report the investigation progress to the Department of Finance and request instructions.</p>
<p>Wuxi: Unprecedented Opium Pill Case Cracked</p>
<p>The well-known opium pill manufacturer Wang Guiqing, previously manufactured opium pills on a boat in the Meijing area. The Public Security Bureau's Supervisory Office cracked the case on May 15th of this year, and arrested boatman Zhu Baoshan. The main culprit, Wang Guiqing, escaped and was placed on the wanted list. The day before yesterday morning, the Supervisory Office received a tip-off that Chen Shaokun's house at No. 10 Nanyang Lane inside Guangfu Gate was selling opium pills. Chief Inspector Wang personally led the entire guard team, patrol team, and detective team police officers to search the premises. They found 41 tins of Guo Fusheng Ren Ma Pai, Chen Feng Pai, Yun Long Pai, and red opium pills of various sizes, totaling 37,600 pills, and arrested Chen Shaokun. Together they were taken to the bureau. Section Chief Yi and Chief Inspector Wang interrogated him severely. Chen confessed that these opium pills were supplied by the wanted opium pill manufacturer Wang Guiqing. Chief Inspector Wang then dispatched Inspector Wang Jixiong, leading police officers and Chen Shaokun, to search Wang Guiqing's house at No. 2 Silangjun Lane. They discovered 1,000 Ren Ma Pai opium pills, 100 packets of Kuai Shang Kuai Du pills, one red pill gun, and scattered opium powder, etc. The main culprit, Wang Guiqing, escaped again. At that time, a modern young woman, Chen Yangshi, happened to come to Wuxi from Shanghai to deliver raw materials for opium pills to Wang's house, and was also arrested. She was taken to the bureau along with Wang Guiqing's wife Wang Hushi and maid Hu Qiusi for questioning. Hu Qiusi claimed to live across the street from Wang's house and was mistakenly arrested. Director Chen found Hu Qiusi's expression to be frightened and highly suspicious, so he personally led Chief Inspector Wang and the police team to search Hu Qiusi's house. They found two opium pill manufacturing machines, a box of raw material powder, 4,550 opium pill paper boxes, opium pill trademark printing paper, etc., and arrested Hu Qiusi's landlord, Xue Zhicheng, and took him to the bureau for questioning and detention pending verification. In total, the search lasted for ten hours and ended in the evening. Yesterday, Director Chen of the Public Security Bureau, believing that the house where Wang Guiqing lived belonged to Hou Hongjian, went to the scene with Hou Hongjian at about 1:00 PM to investigate. Unexpectedly, a large number of opium pills, totaling 109,000 pills, were found in the courtyard of the house. Director Chen ordered the driver to return to the bureau and ordered Chief Inspector Wang to lead the police to bring the opium pills to the bureau. He also summoned and ordered the arrest of Chen Shaokun's wife Zhu and Yang Axue, who introduced Wang Guiqing to live in Hou's house. Director Chen offered a reward of 100 yuan to apprehend the fugitive Wang Guiqing.</p>
<p>Bus Overturns Between Xiyi, Many Casualties</p>
<p>The Jiangnan Long-Distance Bus Company's Xichang bus, with 32 passengers, drove from Wuxi to Yixing the day before yesterday afternoon. It drove at full speed all the way until it reached Fude Bridge near Changxing Town, which belongs to Yixing County. By then it was dusk. A dog happened to be walking slowly in the road. Although the driver honked the horn to warn it, it did not move out of the way, so he swerved to avoid it. However, the bus was moving very fast at this time, and the bridge had a wooden railing, which was broken when the bus crashed into it. The bus also overturned into the river. Fortunately, the river water was shallow, but the passengers were shocked by the impact. Seven people were seriously injured and three died on the spot. More than 20 people were slightly injured. Soon, four more of the seven seriously injured died. The rest were sent to Yixing Minsheng, Renxing, and Fanggu hospitals for treatment. When the bus crashed into the river, a woman washing clothes by the river happened to be crushed under the bus and died on the spot with her brains splattered. The stationmaster of Yixing Station rushed to the scene immediately after receiving the news of the accident and got the bus out of the river. The county magistrate Zhong Jingcheng and the chief of the Public Security Bureau also arrived at the scene to maintain order. The driver, Li Guodong, was temporarily detained at the Yixing County Public Security Bureau. The eight bodies were temporarily placed at Yixing Station for relatives to claim.</p>
<p>Changshu: Road Construction Workers Go on Hunger Strike to Demand Payment</p>
<p>A group of workers who were constructing the Changtai Highway in the Guli Village section had a conflict with the accountant over the settlement of accounts. With the help of the police, the workers were transported to Kunshan and dismissed. Now, more than 200 workers in the Baimao section have come to the city to stay in major hotels because the highway has been completed for many days and their wages have not been paid. The person in charge of the construction site, Tang Lianshi, suddenly disappeared. As a result, the workers were not given travel expenses, and their meals were also not secured. They then found Wang, the engineer of the Fuji Company, surrounded him, and demanded payment, but to no avail. The engineer and the workers did not eat all day. The head of the First District learned of this and telegraphed the Fuji Construction Site in Suzhou to send someone to Changshu to handle the matter and avoid accidents.</p>
<p>Change of County Trial Officer</p>
<p>The county trial officer of this county, Huang Jie, is now ordered to be transferred to Baoshan County to replace trial officer He Ruilin. Huang is quite tired of judicial affairs. After receiving the order, he went to the Suzhou High Court to request resignation. Now, trial officer He Ruilin of Baoshan County arrived in Changshu on the 6th of this month to take up his new post. He first went to the county government to pay his respects to County Magistrate Zhai and ask for instructions on everything. It is now known that He is from Jinhua County, Zhejiang Province, is 26 years old, graduated from Shanghai Law School, interned in Wujin for one year, and has served in judicial positions in Baoshan and other counties.</p>
<p>Haimen: Yang Zhaoti Case Investigated in Shanghai</p>
<p>Yang Zhaoti (also known as Little Yang) of Sanxing Town in the Second District was arrested and detained by the chief of the Seventh Sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau, Jing Bi, in the autumn of the 19th year of the Republic of China on suspicion of theft. He attempted to escape at night and was shot and killed by the police. The Sub-bureau reported it to the county government, which verified and collected the body. Later, Yu and others, believing that Chief Jing had fabricated false charges and committed intentional homicide, filed a complaint with the Supervisory Yuan with supporting evidence. After reviewing the case, the Supervisory Yuan sent the case to the Shanghai District Court for investigation. The District Court has set a hearing for the 10th of this month. Those summoned include the chief of the County Public Security Bureau Hao Zhiying, sub-bureau chief Jing Bi, and Yu and others.</p>
<p>Court Investigates Bribery Case Involving Party Headquarters</p>
<p>When this county implemented the public sale of opium, it established the Yuan Tai Company. It was agreed to bribe the county party headquarters and various agencies 340 yuan per month. Unexpectedly, someone submitted a photographic record of Yuan Tai Company's cash flow, and the Central Party Headquarters sent personnel to verify the facts. All members of the executive committee were dismissed and sent to the Shanghai District Court for trial. In addition to sentencing Cao Dingshi and others for fraud in the Three Factories case, the prosecutor also filed a public prosecution for the bribery case. It is said that the persons involved in this case include former executive committee members Huang Chengjiumao Dingyi and others. With the court date approaching, Huang Chengjiu and others took a boat from Niuhong Port to Shanghai yesterday to find a solution, but with the evidence being solid, it is feared that they will not escape the law.</p>
<p>Ningbo: Salt Police Accidentally Kill Villager While Suppressing Smuggling</p>
<p>In Tianyuanshi, Cui Chen Township, Fu Fang area of the Sixth District of Yuyao, there have recently been a large number of private salt smugglers smuggling private salt. The salt police team's patrol boat learned of this and sent a patrol boat to Cui Chen Township to investigate. At about 6:00 AM yesterday (the 5th), the team received a report that a large number of private salt smugglers would be passing through here. The salt police, armed with guns, ambushed in a remote location to wait. At that time, villagers Chen Zongshun and his son were going to Lishan Hospital for medical treatment and passed through the area. The salt police suspected them of being smugglers and immediately fired a warning shot. Unexpectedly, a bullet hit Chen Zongshun in the head, and he fell to the ground and died. The salt police fled in panic after realizing the accident. Afterwards, the deceased's son, Chen Zhangxian, filed a complaint with the Yuyao County Court, which sent personnel to investigate and handle the matter.</p>
<p>Soldiers and Bandits Clash, Hostage Escapes Dangerously</p>
<p>Xu Baodian, a resident of Chaijia in Tanhou Township, Yuyao, who is from a relatively well-off family. A few days ago, Xu received more than one hundred silver dollars, which aroused the covetousness of bandits. At more than 10:00 PM that night, six or seven bandits suddenly came, each armed with a wooden-cased gun, broke into the house. They then kidnapped Xu when they found no money. It was then learned of by the Tianyuan Town Regular Team. The team leader Xu Zhitang led his team to pursue them. When they arrived at Santangxia, they saw the bandits sitting on the ground. As the team was about to go forward to arrest them, the bandits opened fire to resist. The team members immediately returned fire. For a time, gunshots rang out incessantly, and bullets flew like rain. Soon, the bandits were unable to resist and fled in all directions. The kidnapped Xu Baodian was able to escape danger.</p>

<h3>Special Article</h3>
<p>Reducing Railway Freight Rates and Developing Rural Economies (4) Wu Shaozeng</p>
<p>(1) Production Aspects: The selling price of agricultural products in the consumer market is generally bound by the prevailing market price. Only those of particularly excellent quality can escape this. Therefore, its planned selling price must be close to the market price in order to participate in the competition; otherwise, it will be rejected or suffer losses. Freight is the factor that increases its cost and raises its selling price. Since freight becomes more expensive with distance, the transportation of agricultural products must reach a point where the freight is appropriate for its affordability. Beyond this, due to excessive costs and high selling prices, there is no way to gain a foothold in the consumer market, and progress will inevitably be hindered. For example, the annual production of cotton in Henan is about 16 million kilograms (according to statistics from the 22nd year of the Republic of China), but very little of it appears in markets such as Shanghai. Also, the annual production of rice in Sichuan is about 120 million shi, which is more than enough for self-sufficiency within Sichuan, but in markets such as Nanjing and Shanghai, which are farther away, there is very little Sichuan rice available. All of this is limited by transportation and freight rates (of course, not just railway freight rates), resulting in a state of oversupply within a short-range scope. As a result, the only option is to lower the price or reduce the total production. The cotton in Shaanxi is known as a famous variety, but the statistics for the 22nd year of the Republic of China show that it produced only 500,000 kilograms, which clearly demonstrates that the land was not fully utilized. For example, Shaanxi produced more than 21 million shi of wheat in the 20th year of the Republic of China, but it was reduced to more than 13.9 million shi in the 22nd year of the Republic of China. Although there are differences in the richness of the years, it cannot be denied that it is also due to the lack of full utilization of human resources. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Reading Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>The Problem of Women's Self-Study After Marriage (Continued 4)</p>
<p>Let's talk about the husband's role again. Women's self-study is inherently a personal issue for women, one that others cannot solve. However, because husbands are often the supporters of the family system and live with their wives, their every move has a great impact on women's self-study, and they bear considerable responsibility for solving the problem of women's self-study.</p>
<p>Like Mr. Liu's friend, introducing books to his wife is certainly necessary, and he should do his best to cater to her preferences (without relying on his own opinions) and buy more books and newspapers for her to browse, to gradually arouse her interest. However, this is not the most fundamental method, which is why Mr. Liu's friend still faced rejection from his wife. The most fundamental method is not to treat women as one's own captives, but to increase her courage to enter society and build the love between them on jointly striving for a career (including studying). Thus, on the one hand, it is necessary to reduce the contradictions between her life and thoughts, that is, to reduce her responsibilities for trivial family matters as much as possible, so that she has leisure to breathe. In this way, she will naturally reduce the depression of family life and the need to seek improper stimulation. (It is impossible to ask her to be a loyal housewife on the one hand and to work hard at studying on the other hand. This is merely an illusion arising from the husband's own contradictory old and new thoughts.) On the other hand, it is to increase her interest in self-study, which has already been discussed above.</p>
<p>In short, to say it again, the problem of women's self-study after marriage is related to the entire problem of women's liberation, and a satisfactory solution can only be obtained by striving for women's liberation.</p>
<p>Finally, the discussion in this article, based on Mr. Liu's letter, concerns general educated women, and does not specifically address the self-study of female workers and shop assistants, which is a major shortcoming. This shortcoming will only be filled when the opportunity arises.</p>

<p>Ministry of Education Explanation</p>
<p>The Problem of Vocational School Graduates Continuing Their Education</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 7th) The Ministry of Education issued an order to Tongji University on the 7th to explain the issue of vocational school graduates continuing their education, stating briefly that graduates of junior vocational schools may apply to senior vocational schools and high schools, but not to normal schools. Graduates of senior vocational schools may, in accordance with Article 3 of the regulations for universities and revised vocational schools, apply separately with the qualifications of graduates of equivalent schools.</p>
<p>Ministry of Education Explanation of Regulations for Studying Abroad</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education responded to the Hubei Provincial Government regarding the interpretation of Article 47 of the Hubei Provincial Regulations for Studying Abroad, stating briefly that it had received an inquiry regarding how Article 47 of the Provincial Regulations for Studying Abroad should be interpreted and supplemented, and requested a reply after review. It was found that according to the provisions of this article, if a publicly funded student simultaneously receives a Boxer Indemnity subsidy or other subsidy, the original provincial funding should be immediately stopped, and the provincial funding received from the date of receiving other subsidies should be recovered. The suspension of this funding is a form of sanction against publicly funded students who fail to comply with the regulations. A publicly funded student loses his or her publicly funded status after the funding is suspended. This loss of status cannot be restored even if the publicly funded student stops receiving other subsidies after being sanctioned. A corresponding response is hereby given for reference.</p>
<p>National Academic Work</p>
<p>Consultation Center to be Established Soon</p>
<p>The organizational regulations for the National Academic Work Consultation Center have been drafted by the Ministry of Education and sent to the National Economic Commission for approval. They will be announced simultaneously once the candidate for the director is finalized. Previously, the two departments had tentatively decided on a candidate who is currently the dean of a certain college in a national university in Shanghai and has other duties, but he has indicated that he will not accept the position. The departments need to find another candidate for the director, and they are currently in discussions. A decision is expected soon. The center will have investigation sections to investigate the status of academic staff in specialized schools and universities at home and abroad in order to introduce them to jobs. The original intention was to establish an overseas academic work consultation center in Geneva in addition to the domestic consultation center in order to conduct international investigations and liaisons. However, due to limited funding, the overseas center will not be established for the time being. The monthly cost of the domestic center alone is 3,000 yuan, most of which will be borne by the National Economic Commission, and the Ministry of Education will bear less than the Commission. The center will be established soon, and the organizational regulations will also be announced.</p>

<p>Intercity Swimming Schedule Decided</p>
<p>Guo Zhenheng, Liu Baoxi, and Others Represent Hong Kong to Shanghai</p>
<p>Competition for Three Consecutive Nights Starting from the 13th, Hong Kong Has the Strongest Strength</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Hong Kong-Tientsin Triangular Intercity Swimming Competition is scheduled to be held on the 13th, 14th, and 15th at the French Chamber of Commerce Swimming Pool on Route Tenant de la Tour. Athletes from the three cities have been selected successively. The Hong Kong team has a total of 14 people and will leave Hong Kong on the President Coolidge today, arriving in Shanghai on the 10th. The Tianjin team has only six people and must arrive here by train on the 12th. Due to the insufficient number of people in the Tianjin team, they will not participate in water polo.</p>
<p>Itinerary in Shanghai: The itineraries of the Tianjin and Hong Kong teams in Shanghai are as follows: On the 13th at noon, a luncheon at the French Chamber of Commerce, and the intercity competition will begin that evening, held for three consecutive nights. On the 17th evening, an intercity banquet will be held at the Rowing Club.</p>
<p>Competition Schedule: The schedule for the three nights of the intercity competition is as follows: (1) 13th evening: 220-yard freestyle, 100-yard breaststroke, freestyle relay; (2) 14th evening: 880-yard freestyle, 100-yard freestyle, fancy relay; (3) 15th evening: 50-yard freestyle, 100-yard backstroke, fancy diving, 440-yard freestyle, water polo Hong Kong vs. Shanghai. In addition to the official program, there will be other interesting competition programs each night.</p>
<p>Four Chinese Athletes: Most noteworthy, in addition to Tianjin and Shanghai, among the 14 athletes from Hong Kong, four Chinese athletes have been selected: Liu Baoxi, Guo Zhenheng, Chen Xipei, and Huang Jun. Liu and Guo are both holders of our country's highest records. Last autumn, they once showed their skills in Xiqing. Now representing Hong Kong to Shanghai, victory is expected. Huang Jun participates in diving, Chen is the water polo goalkeeper, Guo in breaststroke, and Liu in backstroke. Their preliminary results are far beyond the reach of Shanghai and Tianjin. The records are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ 100-Yard Backstroke</p>
<p>Liu Baoxi (Hong Kong) 69 2/5 seconds</p>
<p>Oorlwin (Tianjin) 69 3/5 seconds</p>

<p>Shen Bao Radio Weekly</p>
<h3>Copper Oxide Detection</h3>
<p>— Shi Huayu</p>
<p>Usually, the detection work of a radio is performed by a vacuum tube, but now it has been discovered that copper oxide (CuO) can be used as a high-frequency rectifier, and the experimental results are also satisfactory. When a high-frequency voltage above ten volts is input, the detection efficiency of copper oxide is very good. Even when the amplitude modulation component is 70%, the low-frequency voltage output after its detection is the same as the magnitude of the input high-frequency voltage, with no loss. And after intensive measurement, although the high-frequency voltage input is higher, the detection completed by copper oxide is still linear. Therefore, the distortion on the curved part of the characteristic curve caused by using ordinary vacuum tubes as detectors can be avoided. And considering the aspect of saving the radio's space, copper oxide is also better than vacuum tubes. Because copper oxide can be much smaller in diameter than vacuum tubes with the same efficiency. At the same time, we can use four pieces of copper oxide for full-wave rectification or full-wave detection (DoppelwegGieichrichtung). The area of four pieces of copper oxide put together is only as large as the space for a lamp holder.</p>
<p>At the same time, copper oxide is much easier to manufacture than vacuum tubes, and the value is much lower than vacuum tubes, and the efficiency is so high. It is likely that it will take the detection position of vacuum tubes in the near future. As for the high-frequency voltage above ten volts, we can easily obtain it by using one or two stages of high-frequency amplification. Copper oxide also has a most important characteristic, which is the convenience of fading compensation (FADINGKOMPENSATION), because we only need to adjust its detection performance under a high-frequency voltage of ten to one hundred volts.</p>
<p>As for what should be paid the most attention to during assembly, it is necessary to maximize the current passing through it. The most appropriate coupling between the copper oxide detector and the high-frequency amplifier can be found in the attached diagram. In order to make it clear to the reader, the fading compensation section is also drawn in the figure, so the copper oxide in the figure is not completely used for detection. One of them is used to manage the miss-out compensation and is transmitted to the gate of the variable amplification coefficient amplifier tube at high frequency and intermediate frequency, and adjust the input signal voltage.</p>
<p>At the same time, because its output voltage after detection is extremely high (the low-frequency voltage output at 70% amplitude modulation is almost the same as the input high-frequency voltage, and the noise component (klirrfoktorR) is less than 0.5%), it is not difficult to directly excite the final vacuum tube. Resistor B in the figure can be used for volume adjustment.</p>
<p>After using a high-frequency copper oxide rectifier, the radio's installation can be greatly simplified. Therefore, ordinary applications use multi-grid tubes, such as variable amplification coefficient pentodes—the characteristics that input power can be very small—for high amplification. Low amplification and superheterodyne local oscillators are handled by ordinary triodes. Readers, imagine if there is a radio whose high amplification uses a variable amplification coefficient pentode, the detection uses copper oxide for full-wave rectification, the low amplification uses a triode final stage power amplifier tube, and there is also a copper oxide fading compensation section. In fact, this effect is better than the wireless machine used by the three-tube radio, but it only uses two vacuum tubes, and one of them is a very cheap final stage power amplifier tube. Such a radio can be considered popularized!</p>
<h3>How to Add and Adjust a Tuning Meter</h3>
<p>— Ming Xiang</p>
<p>Many radios, although they have the function of automatic volume control, do not have a tuning meter installed. When adjusting the radio station, the most sensitive point cannot be observed with the naked eye, which is a pity. If you want to make your radio more noble, you can follow the description in this article. You only need to add a common milliampere meter to achieve the goal.</p>
<p>The first step is to study the circuit of your radio to determine where the meter should be connected. Usually, the most superior position is the vacuum tube in the high-frequency or intermediate-frequency stage that is automatically controlled. Its screen circuit is connected to the positive pole of the B voltage after the filter. If more than one stage is controlled, you can choose any one. As shown in the figure, at points A and B, if the control voltages received by each vacuum tube are not the same, it is best to connect to the largest stage. In this way, the meter pointer will move more dramatically, and the adjustment will be more obvious. The meter must be connected to the B+ end of the filter, otherwise, the high-frequency current will pass through the meter, making the amplification stage unstable and damaging the meter.</p>
<p>For convenience, the meter can also be connected to the common lead connecting B+ of each controlled tube. In this way, the current passing through is increased, and the rate of change is still the same as before, as shown in point C in the figure. But be careful not to accidentally connect the meter to the common lead of other vacuum tubes that are not automatically volume controlled. The common lead of each controlled tube, if the control voltage of each tube is different, the indicator meter cannot be connected. Pay attention to this point.</p>
<p>The range of the meter should be smaller than the current value in the circuit where it is connected when there is no signal input. Assuming that the current in this circuit is IO M·A·, the range of the meter cannot exceed .5 Ma', such as o-I or o-2M·a·. Because in this way, the pointer of the meter can be calibrated to the maximum degree when the radio is not adjusted to the radio station. Later, if there is a signal input, the distance the pointer jumps is the largest, and the function of the indicator meter is the most sensitive. The calibration method is to connect a variable resistor across the meter as a shunt. Change the resistance of this shunt so that the pointer of the meter shows the maximum degree when there is no signal input.</p>
<p>This kind of indicator meter is extremely sensitive. Even if an extremely weak signal cannot be detected by an ordinary shadow-type indicator meter, the pointer of this meter can still move significantly. Another advantage is that even if the radio is disturbed by atmospheric electricity, the meter pointer will not tremble too much, so that it is impossible to distinguish the signals of weak radio stations.</p>
<h3>Using a Voltmeter as an Ammeter</h3>
<p>— Yong Yan</p>
<p>An ammeter connected in series with a resistor with a very large ohmic value becomes a voltmeter. Because according to "Ohm's Law", the current passing through this ammeter is proportional to the voltage connected to the two ends of this ammeter: therefore, it is only necessary to change the scale to the corresponding number of volts, and it can be used to measure voltage. From this, we can know that a voltmeter can be used as an ammeter if a way can be found. Now, the method of modification is described as follows:</p>
<p>A. Disassemble the voltmeter and remove the series resistor to make an ammeter. (If the resistor is connected, it is still a voltmeter) At this point, the scale of the meter can be calibrated with another accurate ammeter. If the range that this ammeter can measure is still too small, a resistor can be connected in parallel as a shunt to increase its range. The calculation method of this resistor is R = r ÷ (N-I), where R is the ohmic value of the shunt, R is the internal resistance of the ammeter, and N is the multiple to be increased. For example, there is an ammeter with an internal resistance of one ohm and a measurable range of 0.1 amps. If you want to make it measurable up to half an amp, how many ohms of resistor should be connected in parallel? In this case, r is one and N is five: substituting into the above formula, we get R is 0.25 ohms, so we know that a 0.25 ohm resistor should be connected in parallel.</p>
<p>B. The series resistor of the low-voltage section of an ordinary voltmeter is only two to three hundred ohms, so it can also be used to measure current. (Please refer to Mr. Kejun's manuscript in issue 32 of this publication) The conversion of its reading can be done using Ohm's Law. For example, there is a voltmeter with a low-voltage section of ten volts and an internal resistance (see note) of 400 ohms; then when the pointer points to ten volts, the current passing through this meter is ten out of four hundredths of an amp, that is, twenty-five milliamps; therefore, the first volt on the original meter corresponds to two and a half milliamps. This ammeter can also be connected to a shunt as in method A to increase the range of measurable current.</p>
<p>Among the above two methods, method A is more accurate, while method B is only limited to measuring the current in circuits with high resistance, otherwise the measured number is unreliable. When using method B, if the resistance in the measured circuit and the internal resistance of the meter are known, the measured number can be corrected. The method is as follows:</p>
<p>First, use the meter to measure the current amount I, and then use the following formula to find the accurate current amount I = (iR + ir) ÷ R, where r is the internal resistance of the meter, and R is the resistance in the circuit other than the meter.</p>
<p>(Note) The internal resistance of the voltmeter is mostly marked on the meter or in the instruction manual. If not, it can be measured with an ohmmeter or Wheatstone bridge; or it can be calculated using the following method. The method is to connect a resistor R in series with the voltmeter, and connect its two ends to a battery with a voltage of E; if the pointer of the meter points to e volts, then the internal resistance r of the meter is r = e × R ÷ (E - e). According to this method, calculate several rs with different values of R and E, and then find their average value as the accurate value of the internal resistance of the voltmeter.</p>
<h3>Single-Tube Radio Circuit with 58 as Detector</h3>
<p>— Zi Pei</p>
<p>When using a triode to make a single-tube machine, it is always considered that the volume is too low to satisfy the desire. Amateur home users often change multi-pole new vacuum tubes into single-tube machines, and the results are often unexpected. The 2A5'33 powerful single-tube machine already introduced in this publication can use a speaker to play audio when listening to radio stations in this city. Its volume is definitely not comparable to a single-tube machine using a triode. Now, let me introduce another circuit using a 58 high amplification tube as a detector. Its volume is extremely large, and its sensitivity is higher than using 2A or 33, because 58 is originally a high amplification tube. In order to save equipment, a semi-AC type is used. The filament current is supplied by a modified ordinary electric bell square shed, the voltage is 2.5 volts, and the current is one amp. B voltage can be 135 volts, and if it is increased to 180 volts, its volume can be increased. The circuit and the 58's connection method are as follows:</p>

<p>Financial Standard Gold Lingering Uncertain</p>
<p>—Slight Dip of Two Cents—</p>
<p>The gold market presented a lingering situation yesterday, with ups and downs relatively balanced. The overall situation was uncertain throughout the day, but it was extremely stable mid-way. The morning began with overseas silver markets showing gains in London and stability in the US. London spot gold rose by 1.5 pence. Exchange rates initially narrowed but then rose. American cotton rose by 4 points, and American wheat rose by 75 points. Stocks fell by $1.83. Commodities opened at a gross price of around $41, as buyers were present at the listed price after large transactions closed. Gold businesses prepared for trading, retreating to $41.20 as well. A National News Agency report stated that American silver expert Rogers, after inspecting the Far East, had returned to the country to report. Silver advocates generally believe that President Roosevelt will request various countries, including China and France, to use more silver and are hopeful that a new international silver agreement will be established. However, the details of the agreement remain undisclosed. At this time, sentiment was mediocre. After opening, exchange rates rebounded, and with Chinese merchants covering shillings, the situation stabilized. The HSBC exchange rate remained unchanged. Afterwards, there was little room for fluctuation, but the situation remained strong and extremely stable. Later, sentiment saw no hope for higher prices, as many large firms were limiting their supply of gold bars. Those eager to sell at higher prices became more prominent, causing a brief reaction. However, news of President Roosevelt advocating for greater silver use and establishing a new silver agreement spread again, causing prices to fall. Yet, sentiment remained stable. Bargain hunting did not diminish, and prices soon rose again. The market was very stable. Later, banks flooded the market with pounds sterling. Large firms in the market leaned towards selling gold bars and were fatigued, but a report from Bombay indicating a drop of one anna, and the buying interest from groups such as the Dalian gang, were enough to maintain the market. Afterwards, the market was dull, with no upward or downward movement for a long time. Ultimately, continuous selling by banks and large firms, coupled with the second report from Bombay showing no change or a slight decrease of 1.2 annas, led to a slight rebound after the decline, but the closing showed signs of weakness. The daily market situation is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was $942, a slight decrease of six cents compared to the previous close. Commodities opened at the same price. The morning opening exchange rate for recent sales was 1 shilling, 5 pence, 1.875 for British pounds and $35.8125 for US dollars. Sentiment was very stable.

Although there was some fluctuation due to selling by Da Fa Yong, Tong Chun, Yu Qing Yong, and Yuan Xing, prices still rose to $4.44. Qing Yu, Fu Xing Yong, Chun Yuan Yong, and Hong Kang Yong further advanced. It was learned that the listed price remained unchanged. The November price of US dollars at 1.875 proved difficult to settle and rose from $3.88 to $4.88. Heng Yu, Heng Tai, Commodities, and Ying Feng Heng exited. Chun Yuan Yong, Da De Cheng, Zhao Feng Chang, and Hui Yuan continued to advance and lingered above $4 for a long time. The situation was quite favorable. Later, Sheng Da, Da De Cheng, Hong Kang Yong, Fu An, Yuan Mao Yong, and others actively bought, and prices rose to $5. However, at this price, many people sold gold bars, making it difficult for prices to rise further. Sentiment reacted somewhat. Wan Xing, Heng Yu, Yuan Sheng Yong, Fu An, Cui Tai, Yi Cheng, and Fu Yu actively sold. Foreign reports that the American president was reconsidering the silver meeting and advocating for greater silver use by various countries spread again, and the domestic market briefly hardened. The December price of US dollars at 9375 also saw sellers, and prices fell to $2.60. The HSBC November shilling price was also 1.875. Da Fa Yong, Yong Li, Shun Mao, Da De Cheng, and Yuan Mao Yong bought at lower prices, raising them to $3.90.

Bombay reported a second decrease. Tong Yi, Heng Xing, Tian Feng, and Heng Yu slightly increased at lower prices, rising to $3.10. However, as sentiment trended lower, Fu Xing Yong and Yong Li sold gold bars. Yun Tong released November US dollars at 8125, retreating to $2.10. Shen Kang engaged in frequent buying and selling, causing fluctuations. Bargain hunters were very active. Da De Cheng and Yi Yu also increased, rising to $2.50. The closing price was $942.40, and commodities were $2.50. The market was flat after closing. It was found that the highest price of the day was $945 and the lowest price was $942, with a fluctuation of only $3. The result was a slight decrease of two cents compared to the previous close.</p>

<p>Jin Chang Alone Falls, 96 Alone Rises</p>
<p>▲Rumors of 96 Restructuring Again</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the market situation trended from fluctuating to rising, only because silver dollar dismantling was listed at only one cent, and there were rumors of 96 restructuring again. Sentiment gradually improved, the central government's finances were no longer in danger of collapse, the environment was good, and short positions should have another squeezing. The floor short positions, affected by the northern gang covering shorts, showed signs of distress. Regarding future prospects, salt tax could be seen at $60. Transactions were strong due to the northern gang covering shorts and buying the 16th and 46th issues. Trading was more active than before, with three sessions per day, continuing for one week starting yesterday, it was said. Yesterday's events: At the opening, troop reduction rose by 7 cents, and the rest were also good for 3 to 5 cents. Starting from Jin Short, it returned a small 1 or 2 cents to 5 or 6 cents, and the market price was leveled out. The front row of the second session was slightly smaller by 2 or 3 cents and still belonged to the balance, then Jin Short returned to up 3 to 6 cents, and sentiment was able to cheer up slightly. The closing trend was a consistent rise of 1 or 2 cents to 7.5 cents. The 96 issue opened slightly better by about 3 cents and still seemed erratic. The second session and closing gradually saw higher prices, so as a result of the market price, 96 alone rose by one dollar, while the rest rose by two or three cents to 9.5 cents. Only Jin Chang still fell by one dollar, because of the loss of speculative relationship, at first without significance. The total transaction volume was estimated to be 17,320,000 dollars. Now, the results of the rise and fall are listed in the comparison table on the left.</p>

<p>New York Stock Market Mostly Declines, Few Rises</p>
<p>According to a report from the Xin Feng Foreign Firm, yesterday (the 6th), the New York stock market saw the American metallurgy plummet by more than $14, leading to lower prices. The report stated that the company's estimated profits for the past eight months were between $5 and $5.50 per share, which is about half of the company's $15 annual interest rate. The small exchange presented a mixed trend, and bonds drifted without direction. However, the rebound of government bonds was particularly sharp, as auditors asserted that the condition reports of national banks might classify fully guaranteed government bonds, such as housing loan companies and federal farm mortgage companies, as direct government bonds. Despite numerous profit-taking activities, Chicago wheat remained strong at the spot market level and tended towards prosperity. The total daily transaction volume was 600,000 shares.

<p>Yarn and Cotton: Standard Yarn Shows Softness Again</p>
<p>The yarn market turned weak again. The surrounding environment was unfavorable, and the prices of wheat and other commodities also declined. Currently, spot sales continue to come from the South, but transactions for 20-count yarn are relatively lacking. As for the over 1,600 bales of yarn arriving this month, importers will suffer some losses at the market price.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Drops 45 Cents</p>
<p>At the opening of the standard yarn market, the majority of psychology anticipated that the cotton market would rise due to weather conditions, and cotton yarn would also be affected. Therefore, the buying sentiment was still sufficient at the opening. However, many in the industry sold at high prices. The market suddenly fell during the second and third sessions. As a result, the prices for each month were flat, with no change. The market trend turned weak again in the afternoon. Although there was spot yarn business, it was mainly coarse yarn, and transactions for 20-count yarn were lacking. Moreover, the spot selling price fell instead, so there were very few buyers. Prices for each month fell by 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 30,300 bales. Yu Da sold 500 bales, Da Fu 1,400 bales, Chang Yu 500 bales, Yuan Tai 450 bales, Chang Feng 450 bales, Xie Cheng 650 bales, Heng Chang 700 bales, Yong Chang 650 bales, and Da Ji 600 bales.

<p>South China Merchants Buy Actively</p>
<p>The sales of spot yarn are still good, and merchants from the South continue to purchase. It is estimated that all gangs bought a total of 1,280 bales throughout the day.</p>
<p>The market is similar to the previous day. The purchase amounts for each gang are as follows:</p>

<p>Fujian 10 Inland 235 Haizhou 70</p>
<p>Guangdong 510 Changsha 25</p>
<p>Standard Cotton Settlement Stabilized</p>
<p>After three consecutive days of rising, the cotton market showed signs of stabilizing. However, due to the blocked sources from various routes for buyers, the price of Yao cotton rose sharply, and the weather was also cloudy and rainy, which was unfavorable for cotton during the White Dew season. Therefore, floating air activities were used to hedge, and the market was particularly tight. However, the Hankou Huang gang sold at high prices, and the market turned flat in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Morning Good, Afternoon Return</p>
<p>At the initial opening of the standard cotton market, the heavy rain made buyers' intentions stronger, and floating air was eager to hedge, so the opening momentum was extremely urgent. At the same time, the opening price of Yao cotton was $33, up 4 cents from the previous day. Prices for each month rose by 2 and 3 cents. However, the Huang gang sold at the increased price, and the market loosened by 1 or 2 cents during the second and third sessions. As a result, prices for each month only rose by 0.05 to 0.1 or 0.2 cents. In the afternoon, the weather cleared up, and there was some discussion that this year's climate was dry, and new cotton developed earlier. Farmers in various villages had already harvested 50% of the crop. The second and third sessions trended downward. As a result, prices for each month fell by 0.05 to 0.1 cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 128,500 dan. Rui Yuan sold 2,100 dan, Sen Kang 1,000 dan, Jun Chang 1,100 dan, Yu Kang 3,200 dan, Jin Chang 2,700 dan, Tai Xing 1,800 dan, Tong Feng 1,000 dan, Ren Feng 3,200 dan, Yuan Yi 3,100 dan, Yi Cheng 1,000 dan, Yong Chang 1,800 dan, Hong Chang 1,400 dan, Yuan De 1,000 dan, Heng Chang 1,300 dan, Yuan Xing Chang 1,400 dan, and Yi Feng 1,000 dan.

<p>The quantity of standard cotton in the Shanghai Cloth Exchange as of September 6 shows that there were 151,400 dan traded in October, 218,600 dan in November, 238,600 dan in December, 181,200 dan in January, and 32,800 dan in February, for a total of 822,600 dan. Recently, the river channels in various routes have been slightly dry, and new cotton arrivals have been unenthusiastic. Therefore, the market price of Yao cotton has been rising steadily, and the cotton market has been excited and rising. Dafu's short position has been covered up from 90,000 dan, leaving only more than 20,000 dan. The largest buyers and sellers are excerpted below:</p>

<p>American Cotton Market Fluctuates and Remains Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was strong and active due to cotton harvest estimates favoring the bulls. Later, it softened slightly due to selling in the South. As a result, spot prices remained unchanged, and futures rose by 3 to 6 points. British cotton futures rose by 7 or 8 points. Indian cotton was closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram from the 6th).</p>

<p>Yingkou Gang Actively Handles Term Flour</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw an initial flatness followed by stability in each month. The quoted prices of foreign wheat in Chicago and Canada both improved by about 0.1 or 0.2 dollars. When opening prices were quoted, the market situation for this month was still flat, but when opening prices for October were quoted, the manufacturers slightly slacked off on selling, and the minds of those outside the industry turned lively. Furthermore, because the Yingkou Gang had a small amount of business, each month turned slightly profitable in the midst of calmness. By the time the afternoon market opened, transactions were relatively quiet, and the buying and selling of each month was only more than 200,000 bags. However, because factory output was not abundant and those floating in the air outside the industry did not continue to sell, the market atmosphere became slightly better. As a result, this month rose by 0.02 dollars compared to the previous day, October rose by 0.035 dollars, November rose by 0.025 dollars, December rose by 0.0175 dollars, January improved by 0.0225 dollars, and February rose by 0.025 dollars.</p>
<p>Spot Wheat Under-the-Table Prices Have Already Risen</p>
<p>—Term Wheat Is Brought Up With It—</p>
<p>Yesterday's term wheat market was generally flat and sluggish in the morning after the opening. Although the quoted prices of foreign wheat in Chicago and Canada both improved by 0.1 or 0.2 dollars, the market atmosphere was inevitably inconsistent with the norm, as flour fell on the previous day while wheat rose. Therefore, after opening prices were quoted, the market initially appeared stable, but then the bulls returned and the minds of the people softened. Distant months fell by 0.02 or 0.03 dollars compared to the previous day's closing price. By the time the afternoon market opened, it was initially very sluggish, but then, because inland customer gangs bought smoothly and it was rumored that a large batch of spot goods on the market had been hoarded by insiders, the standard situation was also brought up. As a result, this month improved by</p>
<h3>Figure One, Figure Two</h3>
<p>LL1L2 are ordinary three-circuit coils, adjusted with a variable capacitor Cr (also adjustable with a push-pull frame). C and C1 are .○○○35 variable capacitors, C2 is .○○○25 fixed capacitor, R is 2 to 4 megaohms, R·F·C· is a high-frequency choke for broadcasting. OGS connects to the highest voltage of the B battery, which is adjusted by a 6,000-ohm variable resistor R1. This can improve the old sound quality and volume to the best level. If a resistor adjustment is not used, it can be connected to the B battery at 90 volts or 135 volts. In short, the voltage of GS greatly affects the volume and sound quality of this machine. If the voltage is too high, the sound will be suppressed, and if it is too low, the sound will be light and the quality poor.</p>
<p>The soldering of 58 is shown in Figure 2. The cathode grid Sn and the cathode C are connected. The cap is the control grid, and the screen grid is connected to a 6,000-ohm volume adjuster. The cathode is connected to B negative. The rest is connected as a triode, except for the filament H, which cannot be connected to the B battery because it uses alternating current.</p>
<p>The antenna circuit of this machine has at most twelve turns. Too many turns will result in poor selectivity. I have used an indoor antenna in Wusong to listen to various large and small radio stations in Shanghai and Nanjing. Sound can be played in the loudspeaker day and night. If an outdoor antenna is used, the results should be even better.</p>
<p>This machine can be converted to full AC operation. Rectifiers such as 82'80 can be used. Comrades who like to assemble and disassemble may wish to try it.</p>

<h3>### Substitutes for Solder</h3>
<p>— Shan Zhang</p>
<p>Many people think that cigarette wrappers are made of tin foil, but the ones currently used are all made of lead foil, so soldering them is unsuccessful because aluminum, when heated, turns into aluminum oxide, a non-conductive material.</p>
<p>If we want to find a substitute, we can only use toothpaste tubes. Toothpaste tubes are indeed made of tin. When using them, remove the outer lacquer with sandpaper, and then it can be used. If the lacquer is not removed, soldering will be difficult because the organic matter will carbonize. In addition, the outer shell of soft film packaging can also be used. It is not necessary to sand it, which seems convenient, but it is not as easy to find as a toothpaste tube.</p>
<p>It is very expensive to buy a small amount of solder from a coppersmith, and it is not worthwhile to buy a lot, so using our method is very good.</p>
<h3>### Self-Made Rotary Filament Switch</h3>
<p>— Chuan Xun</p>
<h3>A. Bakelite Board B. Copper Pieces (2) C. Key Turn D. Complete</h3>
<p>The filament switch is an indispensable component on a radio. There are many types, and their structure is very complicated. It is not easy for us to make it ourselves without adequate machinery, because when the circuit is open, all conductors must be tightly connected without loosening in order to reduce the resistance in the circuit. When the circuit is closed, the insulation must be good and firm to prevent the possibility of current leakage. Also, there must be elastic assistance when switching. Inexpensive ones are always impractical, so when choosing a switch, in addition to meeting the above conditions, we must also consider its price and the space it occupies. The following is a simple and practical switch-making method suitable for us to make ourselves.</p>
<p>A is the style of the bakelite or hard rubber board required. The three holes can be hot drilled.</p>
<p>B is the style of the elastic copper piece, two pieces in total.</p>
<p>C is a hardwood turning key. Half is a cylinder, and half is a larger square column, with thick copper wire wrapped around it.</p>
<p>Then insert the round rod of the turning key into the large hole in the bakelite. Then press the two copper pieces tightly on both sides (see Figure D, each fixed with screws at the bottom).</p>
<p>It is best to add a spiral tube where the round rod is inserted for mounting on the radio.</p>

<h3>Autumn Ode</h3>
<p>— Lü Qian</p>
<p>Autumn is great, it is lovely! Autumn is indeed the best season of the year. It does not have the cold and sternness of winter, nor the sultry heat of summer; it is even more lively and refined than the annoying spring! It can indeed bring a quiet sense of pleasure and comfort to people from a desolate soul!</p>
<p>Autumn has descended on the world in this way! These green mountains and this green water, how beautiful! How bright! The changing autumn clouds and the continuous autumn rain, how well they can express the poetry of autumn! In the bustling city, autumn shows a proud and composed beauty, revealing the new autumn season of "curtains rolled up by the golden wind, garden condensed with jade dew." Following this, the modern girls with graceful waists and hair in elegant sideburns have changed into new autumn fashions with narrow sleeves and long robes. Facing the soft and refreshing breeze, they brush open the sleeves on both sides, revealing their elastic thighs and silver high-heeled shoes. As their delicate feet move rhythmically, they emit a shining silver light. Their shallow dimples often emerge from their small cherry lips, revealing the comfort and joy that autumn bestows on their hearts! All the people seem to have been suffocated by the scorching heat and only by the help of autumn can they exhale a breath of dirty air and be as active as before! People express infinite goodwill towards the arrival of autumn. In such an environment, autumn is sufficient to console and pride itself!</p>
<p>In the countryside, autumn shows a more charming and natural beauty. Countless fields of half-green and half-yellow rice ears have grown very plump. Each grain of white rice is wrapped in a thin husk, both tender and substantial, swaying in the wind, waiting for the hardworking farmers to harvest them in the near future. At this time, the old farmers wearing bamboo hats smile broadly. One can imagine! They deeply feel the benefits that autumn bestows on them, containing infinite joy!</p>
<p>How autumn makes me miss and yearn! I wish the beautiful and serene autumn would reside in the world forever!</p>
<h3>Anti-Lament for Autumn</h3>
<p>— Mei Xue</p>
<p>An old gentleman, known for his poetry, is once again raising his shoulders and chanting. Seeing the phoenix leaves dancing in the air, he cries in a mournful tone and chants a poem lamenting autumn. A young boy, out of curiosity, hastily asks: "Old man, you are asking for redress, your lament for autumn is unwarranted!" The old gentleman angrily says: "You young fellow, do not speak much. "Alas, the atmosphere of autumn," is the sigh of Senior Official Song. "I only hear the chirping of insects on all four walls, as if to aid my sigh," is the lament of Ouyang Zi. The ancients were still like that, let alone us? You young fellow, do not speak much."</p>
<p>After this statement, the young boy's chatterbox opened up: "Old gentleman, you are mistaken! Autumn is the golden age of harvest, autumn is the beautiful period of results. There is only joy, no sadness. The old-fashioned poet who groans without illness, sees the yellow leaves falling one by one, as if the trees have been wounded. Once they fall, they become withered beyond recognition. Who knew that it was a huge misunderstanding? Without fallen leaves, there would be no results. If every plant and tree all preserved their colorful state, if the flowers did not wither and the leaves did not fall, then how could there be a beautiful harvest? Without a harvest, then the fields would not produce grains, and the forests would not yield fruits, wouldn't that cause a huge panic in society? It can be seen that the season of autumn is giving us a very hopeful period. Autumn has arrived, everything is ripe, grains will soon be on the threshing floor, fruits will soon be on the market. What old farmers and gardeners are eagerly awaiting is this autumn season. Poets should resonate with the masses. When they are moved to poetry, they should say things that welcome autumn and look forward to its arrival. "The autumn wind rises, the leaves fall," these are auspicious omens. They should not groan without illness and make depressing poems. They should not parrot others. Senior Official Song sighed, and you also want to sigh. Ouyang Zi lamented, and you also want to lament. Have you become an echo of Senior Official Song and Ouyang Zi? Poets must have an independent nature. It is already unacceptable to pick up the spit of the ancients, let alone become an echo of the ancients? Old gentleman, you are mistaken!"</p>
<p>Once the chatterbox was opened, the old gentleman had already disappeared. Since he is not chanting poetry, let the young boy babble a few words:</p>
<p>People say, the autumn wind shakes the hundred grasses, I say: the autumn wind becomes ten thousand treasures. "The waves of Dongting, the leaves fly," this is an omen of having autumn. A foolish poet composes lament for autumn, it is said: "what the wicked love."</p>
<h3>Two Views of Autumn</h3>
<p>— Liang Xiaohong</p>
<p>The countryside is a tea-green color, with the leaves of old maple trees dotted here and there like vermilion lips. A thin purple haze floats in the atmosphere. The calm surface of the river slowly sends autumn waves to people. In the warm grassland at sunset, there is a feeling of tenderness and attachment. In the evening, the clear and bright moonlight is sprinkled in the space. In the broken bricks and grass, autumn insects are playing a symphony.... Ah, lovely autumn, it is indeed the most moving season of the year! It is like a young woman in the style of Lin Daiyu, with a simple and dignified appearance, a silent and reserved personality. In its beauty, it carries an inviolable solemnity. In its tranquility, it contains sincere and ardent emotions. Everything about it has the charm of making people pity and love it. In its embrace, we simply don't feel uncomfortable anymore!</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, it is scary enough, with everywhere lurking the opportunity for desolation and killing. Bellicose crickets are one of its products. People, inadvertently, at any time have the possibility of being attacked and killed by disease. Epidemic diseases such as dysentery and vomiting are its most terrifying demonstrations. Don't you hear? The clinics of epidemic doctors have more than two hundred patients every day! Ah, murderous autumn, it is a difficult hurdle that people must pass through every year. We must all be careful not to be swallowed by it!</p>
<p>Autumn, is autumn ultimately lovely or terrible?</p>
<h3>Reproductive Capacity of Autumn Flies</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>"Flies, a single thing, speaking of it, is truly so formidable! Yet in our ancient books, it was thought that "blue flies disorder color, houseflies disorder sound," like the line in the Book of Songs, Minor Odes of the Kingdom, Crow with Young, "buzzing blue flies." The commentary says, "Flies as insects, pollute white making it black, pollute black making it white," which is only a metaphor for petty people, reversing good and evil; until the Biography of Wei Xiao in the Later Han Dynasty, there was "The flight of a housefly, no more than a few steps, relies on the tail of a fine steed, and can sever its group," only then did one know the ability of "flies" is really very great, if it relies on the veins of side power, is this not a very terrible culprit?</p>
<p>This year, in the summertime, good! Heaven, like a fire, emits blazing sunshine, shines on the ground, so that the rivers dry and the water is shallow, even the paddy fields that are planted with rice will dry and crack, making the green seedlings wilt and die; so the many other kinds of pests are affected quite a lot, difficult to breed, exterminating a large amount of molecules, then: speaking fairly, in terms of farming, it is inevitable that there will be a poor harvest, becoming a barren appearance, and in terms of human health, because the weather is dry, the air is dry and hot, all kinds of microorganisms, etc.; there is no place to attach themselves to survive, on the contrary, they have gained a lot of benefits, but ordinary people who lack common sense are unaware!</p>
<p>Now! It has already entered autumn, everyone thinks that the sultry heat can recede and the new coolness attacks people, is it not like the dog days that make people want to drink to death! Oh! Who knows that the weather is still very hot, and like "flies" that are a great enemy to our lives, have become prosperous with a buzzing sound; what is the reason for this?</p>
<p>I dare not speak recklessly, in reality autumn is more unclean than summer, in reality, there are many, just looking at the streets, watermelon rinds, bean pod rinds, corn cobs, everywhere are enough to attract countless "flies" to gather, in this way: "flies" naturally gather more and more every day; according to scientists, "flies" from eggs to larvae, to the adult stage, although there are differences in length, every time they lay eggs, hey! At least there must be one hundred and dozens, calculated with half male and half female, from then on, constantly mating, their children and grandchildren, about ten generations, then: the lineage of "flies", does it not occupy a hundred trillion trillion times how much? Yo! This alarming great enemy of life, must be in the hot weather of autumn, think of ways to eliminate it!</p>
<h3>Postscript</h3>
<p>I and the cuckoo among birds are the same sorrowful seeds between heaven and earth, so even in spring and summer, worrying about the country and the family, I often have a lament for autumn. Now it is autumn again! This "autumn rain, autumn wind, sorrowful grain people" autumn, my sorrow is needless to say. On a boring autumn night, I examined the manuscripts from writers from all directions, and there were many writings about "autumn," so I made a special issue of "autumn" to show solidarity. This is the postscript. In the autumn of Jiaxu, Zhou Shoujuan wrote at the Violet Hermitage.</p>
<h3>Autumn Insect Chat</h3>
<p>— Huo Xueming</p>
<p>As usual, I should write a small introduction here, the best thing is: "A year is easy, it is autumn wind again." In the autumn wind, dark crickets are chirping, the sound is so powerful that people feel a kind of interest. If you lived in the countryside in your childhood, you must have listened intently under the eaves of your house, beside the flower beds in the yard, with your ears pricked up. Your heart was laughing, but you were calm. Once you determined the source of the sound, you would sneak over, hold a golden thread cover, squat down, and quietly brighten your eyes. While gently moving the eaves, you would quickly cover the cricket with the golden thread cover. If it jumped and escaped, you would inevitably jump up and chase it. At this time, the courage of the chase was indeed very laughable.</p>
<p>However, catching crickets in childhood, like catching fireflies, was without purpose, only feeling it was fun. Later, seeing adults in tea houses using crickets, weighing them against each other, and using small grasses to provoke them to fight, thus determining that the owner who raised crickets would use money to determine the outcome; then one knew that crickets had another use, no wonder opium addicts went out all day to overturn bricks and pick tiles, even searching in tombs, in order to earn money.</p>
<p>But the parents at home, for children who did not study and write well, but caught crickets with wild children, the parents would definitely scold them for being unfilial, and would definitely not allow them to bring crickets home. Even if they secretly put the little insects in a matchbox (because they had no money and did not dare to buy a cricket pot openly), and put them on the corner of their pillow before going to bed, they could not help but cry out. As soon as the cry started, the parents would throw the matchbox into the spittoon, and say that people who catch crickets would become good-for-nothing hooligans like Wairentuzi, and Wairentuzi's shorts were indeed torn, only squatting beside the tomb all day with his ears pricked up.</p>
<p>One can imagine the wounds etched on the innocent heart of a child whose beloved chirping insect was thrown away. He was almost as sad as if he had lost his rocking horse or doll. However, he dared not rebel against his parents, he only hated his parents. Why were his parents not like A'Hu in the tea house treating their children! During the day, when Little Tiger caught a big cricket, his father stroked his hair, praised him repeatedly for being clever, and even scratched his thumb, looked at the cricket, and shouted loudly to people: "This is a general! Is this not a general! How loud it cries! How big its teeth are!"</p>
<p>It was enough not to praise him. But why can other people's children catch crickets, but his own cannot? If he cannot catch them, it is enough, why do you not let the ones that have already been caught go to the courtyard and let them live, but instead throw them into the spittoon to drown? You hear, after throwing them down, they keep crying, probably their wings are soaked in water, and also the sound of the matchbox hitting the copper spittoon, the cricket must be struggling, mourning, but.... Now half a point of sound has already disappeared, the night is so desolate, the child's heart is crying in the dark.</p>
<p>The above description, although it is my personal imagination, but the same facts will definitely exist. The feeling of resentment towards their parents at that time could not be avoided by anyone. When I was young, I was also very naughty. After being reprimanded by my mother for catching crickets once, I never dared to repeat the offense. However, at that time, I did not feel how bad it was to play with crickets. Of course, I did not understand that this kind of game would lose the will to be enterprising and indulge in the vulgar habit of gambling!</p>
<p>Later, after reading the History of the Song Dynasty, I felt that Jia Sidao, in the Banxian Hall, in addition to indulging in pleasure with concubines, actually neglected politics because he was obsessed with playing with crickets, and then I knew the reasons why my parents used to reprimand me. Shen Zhou passed Geling, and there was a poem about this incident saying:</p>
<p>"In the idle hall, the treasure pavilion is in the picture, heaven begged the lakes and mountains to support the prime minister. It is exactly the day of many events in Xiangfan, but he specializes in battle tests of autumn insects! ——Truly ironic and humorous! Little did he know that there were still juggling and shuttlecock kicking tricks that echoed before and after! As for what is said in the Legacy Matters of the Tianbao Era: "Every time autumn arrives, the concubines in the palace compete to catch crickets in small golden cages and place them beside their pillows to listen to their voices." This is similar to the meaning of the child secretly hiding crickets described above. However, at the same time, it can also be seen that the palace people of the dynasty have the sorrow of "not being able to see them for thirty-six years." Therefore, all poems that chant crickets mostly contain a desolating tone, such as Bai Juyi's "dark cricket chirping night is continuous," Zhang Lai's "the dark cricket in the stone bottom chirps at night first," Wen Tingyun's "the dry pond connects to the broken bank, the cold cricket chirps;" can make oneself seem to be between sand traces, in the quiet of the night, hearing the desolate chirping. I only wonder how those soldiers who are good at internal strife, killing each other, actually forget that the imperialists who are watching from the sidelines are using crickets to incite them, to provoke them to slaughter, and to observe the success or failure from the outside; what are their thoughts?</p>
<h3>Strolling Alone on an Autumn Night</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>The night with the eyes of a lover so tender, is an autumn night! Lonely, lonely.</p>
<p>Carrying a collection of poems, I stepped out of Huage Gate, walking slowly on the green stone of the alley. Autumn insects were hiding in the holes at the foot of the wall, in the cracks of the stones, and in the piles of broken bricks, crying with sorrow, crying with bitterness, crying with the loneliness of the night.</p>
<p>The electric light of fifteen candlepower shone on this long alley, and the places not illuminated were darkly unfolding the wings of bats, filled with the autumnal night wind, blowing towards me, filling my chest, feeling the taste of desolation. Half of my thin, long shadow was attached to the white powder wall, and half of it was falling to the ground. People were sandwiched in the middle layer between the high walls, like a tame deer walking under the cliffs. Passing leisurely days.</p>
<p>Passing a bland, empty life, this desolate journey.</p>
<p>Walking out of the alley, Penglai Road, in the circle of the autumn moon, was lightly draped with a veil of poetry. The phoenix trees on the sidewalk were sighing, the autumn wind gave them the tone of sadness, the autumn moon reflected their weak shadows, the yellow leaves could not bear the destruction of the season, falling branch by branch, wandering everywhere, being trampled on by various different feet, people who had lost their souls, the decadent people in a declining life.</p>
<p>The door of "Qingjie Hall" was black and oily, the moonlight was blocked by the high fire wall, it seemed that many ghosts were holding a night dance party, hanging a trembling heart, constricting sweat pores, quickly passing by, the grass under the wall was sobbing in the autumn night wind.</p>
<p>Some low houses, some fences, some lights shining out from the cracks in the board doors. It was getting cold, there were no people camping out, leaving the door crowded with bottomless desolation, silence, and desolation. Like a lonely traveler on a deserted island, like a Mongolian nomad in the wilderness.</p>
<p>I ran into "Wenmiao Park," and the protein-colored lights were spying on the outline of the Eastern architecture. The moon was drunk in the creek, I opened the collection of poems and recited silently, and recited aloud the sentences that were enchanting, walking back and forth along the path covered with moonlight, the autumn night walker closed his eyes, and was a little drunk!</p>
<h3>We Must Cry Out Against This Injustice</h3>
<p>— Beast</p>
<p>—Regarding "Where Are the Great Works?"</p>
<p>Concerning the production of great works, I remember that as early as several months ago, Mr. Chen Boqi already discussed it in his article "The Requirements for Great Works." Afterward, in a certain monthly magazine, there was also a solicitation of essays on "Why Are There No Great Works Being Produced in China Currently," which many writers answered. Moreover, such discussions scattered in various places are even more numerous. In summary, they can be roughly divided into the following reasons:</p>
<p>1.  Unfavorable environment.</p>
<p>2.  Writers' abilities are insufficient, lacking courage.</p>
<p>3.  The Monroe Doctrine of the literary world.</p>
<p>4.  Chinese society is changing too rapidly, and the literary movement cannot keep up.</p>
<p>In fact, it is very difficult to objectively determine whether a work is great or not. What kind of work? What standards should be used to judge whether a work is great or not? In my opinion, if a writer can grasp the current real society and thoroughly base their work on new concepts, using realistic techniques to imply the trends of the times, they can become active in front of readers and become a great work. In other words, as long as it depicts reality truthfully, it can become a great work; as long as it truthfully depicts reality, it can become a historical monument.</p>
<p>From this, we can see that Mr. Hunren's eloquent discussion in the "Free Talk" section of the Shen Bao (30th) is inaccurate. Mr. Hunren said that the reason why great works are buried in wastepaper baskets is due to "the Monroe Doctrine of editors and the profit-seeking of bookstore owners, but the main responsibility should be assigned to the readers." I don't understand how Mr. Hunren slurred his words and dragged us readers into this. It is truly a sin that only Heaven knows. Such a major sin that damages the entire Chinese literary world is supposed to be shouldered by us. Here, I cannot help but cry out against this injustice!</p>
<p>Mr. Hunren said: "The creation of this abnormal phenomenon is the fault of the editors and bookstore owners, but the main reason is not entirely with them, but with the general blind readers, because they are a group of pitiful creatures without any prejudices, clinging to the purpose of the works of famous writers, and when literary giants say humorous writing is good, they read humorous magazines and books. When they say essays are good, they choose essays to read. In short, even a literary giant's fart smells fragrant to them. As for unknown works, they don't even bother to take a look, as if looking at them would cause them harm."</p>
<p>We believe that Mr. Hunren's remarks are too arbitrary and unfounded. It is true that famous writers are easier for us to notice because we are familiar with them, while unknown works are easily overlooked because they are too unfamiliar. Moreover, before we see them, we don't even know that there is a new person providing a good work somewhere. How can you ask us to pay attention in advance? In the current literary world, with no great works discovered and the daily impressions given to us by the real society being so bad, full of complaints and nowhere to vent our anger, humorous essays that give us a bit of laughter and scolding are naturally regarded as the only nourishment. To say that we are pitiful creatures without any prejudices, unable to distinguish good from bad, then let me ask, since the May Fourth Movement, how many new famous writers have emerged, like Mr. Hunren, who have joined the ranks of writers, and who recognized them? According to him, the reason why famous writers become famous is "by struggling with great, initially unknown works." Then who recognized these great, initially unknown works? We don't understand why Mr. Hunren's words are so contradictory.</p>
<p>As for saying that looking at unknown works would cause harm, the writers here don't understand the readers' difficulties. First, readers already find it very difficult to buy magazines, not to mention books. For example, the so-called "Special Issue for Unknown Writers" in the past wasted a lot of money, and the content was undoubtedly unqualified. This is in terms of economic ability. In terms of time, the time spent earning a living is already a whole day, with very little spare time. Many valuable books are still not free to explore. How can there be time to waste on disappointing results? This harm already exists primarily, not to mention anything else.</p>
<h3>Passing Old Master Ridge</h3>
<p>— Xicun</p>
<p>The horse pulling the cart, the people sitting lazily in the cart, were equally lazy. It was too hot. Encountering a westward road in the afternoon, the sun shone directly into the carriage from the arched front canopy, drenching both the lazy horse and the lazy people in sweat.</p>
<p>Along the way, there were hills and farmlands. It seemed as if the wind was completely blocked, but it was actually wrong to blame the wind. The trees in the mountains near and far were all drooping their heads so obviously, standing there blankly, which was clear evidence. So, fundamentally, there was no wind blowing this afternoon.</p>
<p>"We're almost at Old Master Ridge," said the coachman.</p>
<p>In Jilin Province alone, the number of mountain ridges named Old Master Ridge is probably more than the fingers on one hand. The Old Master Ridge mentioned here is located forty li southwest of Jilin Provincial City. In the past, before the South Manchuria Railway and the Jichang Railway were completed, anyone traveling from Shenyang to Jilin had to pass through this place because this road was the main post road.</p>
<p>Hearing the coachman say that we were approaching Old Master Ridge, the lazy passengers and those who were dozing off, bumping along with the cart, all sat up, grabbing the canopy bow, and invigorating their spirits, staring ahead with wide eyes. This was all because the ridge pass was a difficult obstacle.</p>
<p>This was the eastern ridge pass. From the bottom to the top of the ridge, it was at least three li long. Lush green trees grew on the roadside, and on the other side was a stone beach covered with chaotic rocks. A stream of spring water, no more than an inch deep, meandered across the stone beach. There were not many farmlands here, mostly forests, some tall, some short, and some weeds and wildflowers. There was also no one living here. Therefore, over the years, after the green gauze curtains rose, it became a nest for bandits to emerge.</p>
<p>The "Manchukuo's" maintenance of治安 was unmatched compared to the past. Encountering such places, travelers would naturally be worried.</p>
<p>"Old man, you have to keep your eyes open."</p>
<p>I think the coachman's words are useless. Even if your eyes can truly see in all directions and your ears can hear in all directions, please tell me, if you see and hear everything, can you escape the bullets from the bandits' guns? His appearance was really tense. In this situation, he was a hundred times more worried than us travelers because this cart was his entire property. If he encountered bandits and his horses were robbed, not only would his property be bankrupt, but it would also cut off his livelihood.</p>
<p>If at this time you heard a gunshot, or encountered five or six people loitering together, then everyone would be frightened. But we finally walked step by step to the top of the ridge.</p>
<p>To be honest, I am not afraid of bandits. I have nothing but my bare body. I would rather see them. Wouldn't it be even better if they were a small team of volunteer soldiers? A year ago, the anti-Japanese volunteer army had set up defenses here, which was indeed a dangerous place that soldiers had to fight for. I hope that in the near future, more of those heroic warriors will appear here again.</p>
<p>There is a temple at the top of the ridge. Except for the first and fifteenth days of the lunar month, when it is open, the two vermilion doors are always tightly closed. It is not easy to see the monks. Encountering such deep mountains, such dangerous places, such temples, one cannot help but think that there is a question mark there.</p>
<p>Opposite the temple is a steep cliff. The road passes through the middle, like a pass. The road going down the west side of the ridge is more difficult to walk than when climbing the ridge. Not only is the ridge road very steep, but it is also very narrow. This is the most difficult section to walk on the entire ridge. Sometimes, the horse pulling the shaft cannot steady its feet and slips, often overturning the cart. Then, the cart, the horse, and the coachman roll down the ridge like a pile of chaotic rocks.</p>
<p>Whenever going down the ridge, passengers always have to get out of the cart and walk until they reach the bottom of the mountain before they can sit down again.</p>
<p>In the evening, I stayed in a cart inn thirty li west of the ridge. I heard that a merchant carrying goods was robbed in the morning. The innkeeper said that there was a small gang on the ridge these days, with about five or six small guns. They don't rob carts, they don't rob poor guests. So, they are specifically paying attention to wealthy people. In that case, maybe they were hiding in the forest when we passed the ridge. Naturally, they saw us clearly. They didn't rob us, maybe they were kind enough to let us go?</p>
<p>The coachman, like a pardoned prisoner, drank old wine while smiling and asking us several passengers:</p>
<p>"Old men, we had good luck today. How about buying a few melons to eat after dinner?"</p>
<p>The innkeeper, as if he himself were a traveler, said with a smile, "This, of course, haha."</p>
<p>The passengers all smiled and reached into their pockets to take out money to complete this melon feast.</p>
<h3>The Enemy That Bullets Cannot Eliminate</h3>
<p>— American National Weekly</p>
<h3>Planting Sweet Potatoes</h3>
<p>— Pu Feng</p>
<p>Without enough land, the early rice was just harvested, and the plows and harrows immediately loosened the soil; without rest throughout the year, another season of sweet potatoes must be planted in the thin and barren fields.</p>
<p>The yellowish-black soil was hooked up, and long soil ridges cleared deep and long paths. Sweet potato seedlings more than a foot long were put down, a thin layer of fertilizer was spread, and another layer of soil was immediately added.</p>
<p>The seedlings were constantly planted, the ashes were continuously spread, and the soil was constantly piled up; how many sweat drops were buried by the hoe each time? How much hard work did each sweet potato seedling accumulate?</p>
<p>The withered seedlings clung tightly to the soil, and bucket after bucket of water was poured down, also hoping for rain and dew from the heavens. Yes, perhaps the green leaves will show vitality tomorrow, but who guarantees that there will definitely be a good harvest three months later?</p>
<h3>Psychological Calligraphy Expert Infers Good and Bad Fortune</h3>
<p>— Wu Shaoxi</p>
<p>I remember that three or four months ago, scientific spirit writing diagrams were all the rage in Shanghai. At that time, all the newspapers attacked them fiercely, thinking that it was right to drive out superstition and ghosts borrowing the name of science to do strange things there.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, as time passed, the ghosts of scientific spirit writing had just been driven out, and a very beautiful American professor came again, who was the psychological calligraphy expert Professor Ren Dao (Prof. Zandar), who can look at a person's handwriting and infer their past and future. He is now stationed in a certain hotel and officially meets the people of Shanghai, and can infer the good and bad fortune of love, marriage, wealth, career, and travel, so that people know what to pursue and avoid.</p>
<p>This matter can attract people's attention, because Mr. Ren Dao is a professor, a psychological calligraphy expert, so naturally he is a scientist, and his inferences are certainly more "scientific" and more effective than scientific spirit writing.</p>
<p>However, the facts that psychology tells us are different from this. Although a few psychologists also study calligraphy, they only want to infer a person's personality from the handwriting, and can never investigate good or bad fortune. This kind of research is still in its infancy, has not reached maturity, and has not obtained any completely reliable conclusions. Some psychologists even doubt the possibility of success of this kind of research. But now there are people who are fueling the flames beyond the scope and ability of psychology, thinking that good and bad fortune can be inferred from calligraphy. What an absurd thing this is.</p>
<p>It is very obvious that professor and psychological calligraphy expert are deceptive titles, and in reality it is just a genuine江湖客 — foreigners' tricks are after all fresher than those of Chinese people, and江湖 fortune-telling combined with a professor, plus commercialized biscuits, the three are not worried about not matching the taste of Shanghai people, or many people will want to be anesthetized once, but psychology will suffer.</p>
<h3>Younger Brother (12)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Wen</p>
<p>When I ran into their brigade headquarters, his colleagues told me that he had been sent to escort things to the provincial capital and lost them and would be back tomorrow. Those colleagues had known for a long time that I was going to Nanjing and thought that I would definitely have a lot of influence in the future. They all came to curry favor with me, saying that they were all good friends of my younger brother. They said that my younger brother was very small, and people bullied him. He had even been beaten by a company commander. He seemed very negative.</p>
<p>The next day, while I was still in my younger brother's bed, I heard someone calling "Older brother" in my ear. When I opened my eyes, I almost didn't recognize him as my younger brother. Although his face was still as black as before, it was very thin, and his cheekbones seemed about to protrude. His face was no longer as rugged as before, but had a deep complexion. He looked at me as if he was very happy, but he couldn't speak.</p>
<p>"Younger brother, I've been waiting for you for a day," I said, sitting up and grabbing his hand.</p>
<p>"Yes, I rushed back."</p>
<p>"Younger brother, you..."</p>
<p>Just then, a colleague walked in, and my younger brother suddenly winked at me, as if implying that I shouldn't rush to speak. He urged me to wash my face and come out with him.</p>
<p>On the road, my younger brother looked left and right before saying:</p>
<p>"Did those guys talk to you about anything?"</p>
<p>"We talked, just casually. They said they were all your good friends."</p>
<p>"Humph, good friends! They almost killed me. Older brother, after you leave, I must come in the future. This kind of thing is really not for humans, it's despicable and disgusting!"</p>
<p>Just as he was talking, my younger brother's shoulder was suddenly patted heavily, followed by a voice:</p>
<p>"Where are you going!"</p>

<h3>Questions on Reading "Accepting the Legacy and Sorting Out the National Past"</h3>
<p>— A Long</p>
<p>Yesterday, I happened to have an urgent need and went to the toilet. I happened to have the book "Literature, Volume 3, Number 3" with me, so I carefully read it in the toilet. When I read the article "Accepting the Legacy and Sorting Out the National Past," I found a few doubts, but I have very few friends who are writers who accept the legacy, so I have no way to ask for advice. I have to write it out again to ask for advice from writers who have accepted the literary legacy, hoping that Mr. Hua Sheng will not misunderstand again and say that I am writing 洋八股 and have ulterior motives.</p>
<p>Here, I must first declare that I am not writing this article to participate in the battle group, nor am I deliberately messing up the solemn literary world. Most of the writers in the literary world are friends with deep roots and are very remarkable. Therefore, although I don't treat the articles of writers in the literary world like Christians treat the Bible as a sword, I also value them like our country's Bible-like biographies. How dare I participate in and mess up the literary world.</p>
<p>I started reading the first sentence, "Since the beginning of this year, this journal has raised the issue of literary legacy." I was shocked and deeply sorry, "Literary legacy" was originally proposed by your journal first, which is as valuable as Watt's invention of steam and Columbus's discovery of the New World. Some people say that this term is imported from "Russia," but in any case, it is a treasure that the gentleman has painstakingly accepted from foreign countries as a literary legacy, but this will not be discussed.</p>
<p>But what I don't understand is the word "legacy." If according to my stupid explanation, assuming that the ancestors are dead, the property left behind is called "legacy." The literary explanation is probably no exception, but between the literary ancestors' death and the general filial descendants' acceptance of the legacy, there must be a period of time. I don't know in which year the death of our country's literary ancestors occurred? And I don't know in which month the inheritors accepted the "literary legacy"? I really don't understand it at all.</p>
<p>If according to the political system, is the establishment of the Republic of China the beginning of the "accepting the literary legacy" period, or is the establishment of the National Government the beginning of the "accepting the literary legacy" period? If according to the literary system, is the abolition of the imperial examination the beginning of the "accepting the literary legacy" period, or is the vernacular movement the beginning of the "accepting the literary legacy" period? Or is the shouting of the masses' language the beginning of the "accepting the literary legacy" period? Where is the "paragraph" period in between?</p>
<p>There is also one point, what is the difference between "literary legacy" and "sorting out the national past"? According to Mr. Hua, "So we raise the issue of the Chinese literary legacy, not to actively indicate what the legacy is, but to passively point out what is not the legacy." According to Mr. Lin Xiao, "What is the difference between 'literary legacy' and 'sorting out the national past'?" According to the two gentlemen, although the names are different, the nature is not much different. But I approve of the four characters "sorting out the national past." Why? If you look at the literal meaning of the four characters "literary legacy," "literary legacy" is to accept all the ancestors' literature, but among the legacy, gold, silver, and jewelry are naturally accepted, but broken tables, broken benches, and broken rags are also accepted at the same time, without any distinction or choice. Unless Mr. Hua comes to explain like Master Zhu's notes, we are really ignorant.</p>
<p>If you say "sorting out the national past," since it has been sorted out, of course there is the meaning of re-allocation, distinguishing between what to take and what to leave. Among the national past, some of course should be displayed in the museum, some should be displayed in the libraries of various provinces, preparing for people from various places who study academics to refer to, and some should be placed in the public education hall for everyone to study. This is the meaning of "sorting out the national past," which the Western philosophers call re-criticism and re-evaluation. And Mr. Hua must say that "literary legacy" is right, and "sorting out the national past" is wrong. If it's not that the gentleman has ulterior motives (borrowing the gentleman's words), what other reason is there?</p>
<p>There is another question, Mr. Hua said: "Chu Ci is the name of a general collection, and Lisao is just one of them, and it shouldn't be said so confusedly." My view of these two sentences is also somewhat different from the gentleman's. When I was more than ten years old, a Mr. Li wearing old-fashioned glasses told me about the biographies of Qu Yuan, saying, "Qu Yuan was worried that the king was not intelligent, that slander covered the light, that evil harmed the public, and that justice was not welcome, so he made Lisao out of worry and contemplation." When Mr. Li talked about this, he pushed his glasses up to his forehead and scolded the foolish monarch loudly, and he turned around and solemnly told me that you should not misunderstand, the so-called "Lisao" does not only refer to the Lisao article, but refers to the entire Lisao collection of Qu Yuan, because Lisao is the first article, so the entire book is named after Lisao, and later people called it Chu Ci, because Qu Yuan was from the state of Chu, so it is called Chu Ci, but in fact Chu Ci is not limited to the book Lisao, that is, such as Song Yu, Tang Le, and Jing Cha are all Chu people, so their works are also included in it. The entire Lisao collection is named Lisao, just like the first two characters in the first sentence of "Xue Er Ba Yi" are used as the general name of the entire book. This is what I heard from my teacher.</p>
<p>Later, I also came to study this sentence a little bit myself. Since it is said, "Therefore, he made Lisao out of worry and contemplation," it can be known that it is not only the Lisao article, but what Qu Yuan made out of worry and contemplation, and the other articles were not made out of Qu Yuan's worry and contemplation, the meaning is very clear. Try to observe the following "Tai Shi Gong said, I read Lisao, Tianwen, Zhaohun, Aiying, and was saddened by his ambition," then the following articles are also undoubtedly made out of worry and contemplation, so later people even annotated this sentence as Tianwen, Zhaohun, Aiying in Lisao. Although the saying is not necessarily true, it is also passable. And Mr. Hua must say that Chu Ci is the name of a general collection, and Lisao is an article in the general collection. Since his advocacy is so firm and his explanation is so clear, because I have not accepted Qu Yuan's literary legacy, I dare not argue. Perhaps the old-fashioned gentlemen in the past are unreliable, or perhaps Tai Shi Gong is also a gentleman who heard well and saw plainly, and did not accept Mr. Qu Yuan's literary legacy, so there is this misunderstanding? This is also my question.</p>
<p>In short, in a unified way, foreign imports are reliable, and the four characters of literary legacy, no matter how you mix them up, the head size always fits, and readers feel new and joyful when they read it. If you say sorting out the national past, I have a headache when I hear it. I advise the two gentlemen, Mingtang and Lin Xiao, to read more books and not to talk nonsense.</p>
<h3>Autumn Memories</h3>
<p>— Ms. Jiong</p>
<p>Autumn is here!</p>
<p>The unprecedented heat of the past sixty years has disappeared without a trace and will no longer grow in this world.</p>
<p>Although the refreshing weather makes people feel comfortable, a sad mood cannot help but float up a layer of melancholy!</p>
<p>The wind blows in gusts, and the breath of infinite coolness comfortably invades the naive heart of childhood. Chrysanthemums are blooming in various colors, yellow, white, and different colors. Butterflies fly in pairs in the dense chrysanthemum bushes.</p>
<p>Autumn is here, and many crickets are buried in the flowers and plants, constantly making autumn sounds, implicitly tempting us to pursue their traces. The clear blue pond is quiet and beautiful. The autumn wind blows, causing ripples, and the willow branches are reflected in the water. Our fishing boats float and dance on the water. At that time, I was seven years old and my brother Jing was five years old. I vaguely remember that autumn. My father ran to the provincial capital for official business and did not return for three years! My mother was almost exhausted from the busyness of my older sister's wedding, unable to rest day or night! Our whole family said that autumn was an unprecedented season! Only my brother Jing and I, without any evil intentions, still lived a life of indifference! Every day, we always took advantage of the arrival of autumn, when there was no strong sunlight shining on our heads, we would hide in the bamboo forest and grope for the origin of the autumn insects that were calling 喞喞. We hunted crickets everywhere, but when the crickets heard human voices, they stopped calling and quietly hid.</p>
<p>This year's autumn has arrived as expected.</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>The shadows of the trees are sparsely reflected on the window, and the flowers and plants become so withered and yellow overnight. The evening wind blows, and the crickets seem to have disappeared. In the eight years that I have drifted in this dusty city, I have never heard their sad cry again! With the flowing years, the scenes of childhood have all dissipated in the years of chaos between soldiers and bandits in my hometown, and can never be presented before my eyes again.</p>
<p>The autumn moon gushes out a crystal clear plain color, as if it can connect all souls and become the vast universe. The autumn tong trees hit the surroundings of the house, and together with the autumn wind, they hit the leaves, making rustling sounds. Following the shadows of autumn, the happy childhood heart has long been buried so quietly by frequent sorrows. If I could hear some autumn insects chirping from the courtyard of my childhood, I think my heart would also be the same, only slightly depressed.</p>
<h3>Autumn Window Musings, One</h3>
<p>— Jun</p>
<p>—The Jasmine-Selling Girl—</p>
<p>Following several days of rain, a tender coolness of autumn shrouded the human world.</p>
<p>Autumn brings some pleasures that the just-departed height of summer lacked, allowing the suppressed breaths, soaked in the west wind for months, to ease a little; but at the same time, it also brings some faint melancholy, lacking in the height of summer, and a concentrated sadness. Although the heat lingers, reminiscent of the departed summer, it newly adds a thick layer of melancholic feeling to the mind.</p>
<p>The autumn of the season and the autumn of the heart, ah!</p>
<p>Perhaps there are still green leaves to be longed for in autumn. However, before my eyes, an endless grayness is spread out as if a net. I feel that everything outside me has gradually detached itself from me, becoming ever colder and more distant, leaving me living alone in the crowded island of humanity.</p>
<p>"Autumn has come again, oh, the heart of a wanderer!" I often murmur this towards the gloomy, leaden sky. After a period of murmuring, a feeling, also like a lump of copper, presses upon my heart. Every day, I hear the clamorous shouts on the street in the alley below, and among those shouting voices, there is a sighing voice like that of a young woman, "Jasmine flowers for sale, jasmine flowers for sale," crisply entering my ears, and I can't help but echo in my heart in the same tone:</p>
<p>"Autumn jasmine flowers, oh, the heart of a wanderer!"</p>
<p>Sighing so deeply.</p>
<p>That young woman selling jasmine flowers, although having the youth of a jasmine flower, no longer has the fresh and beautiful color of a jasmine flower's youth. Dim, like a jasmine flower left overnight, about to wither.</p>
<p>After calling out a few times, she disappears into the noisy clamor. But after the calling sound passes, a silent sound remains on my heart, lingering, along with the shadow of a youthful yet haggard figure.</p>
<p>But it has been a full year since I saw that shadow or heard that sighing voice!</p>
<p>But this shadow and this silent sound also eternally gnaw at my thoughts, like a worm, until this day.</p>
<p>And afterwards, every day I still lean against the small window, watching the sunlight shine on the high wall opposite, and then sink down in the afternoon. Everything is unchanged, except that the sound and the shadow are gone. Sometimes when I accidentally think of it, I look at the clouds drifting leisurely across the sky, the azure sky, immersed in a deep and long memory, already a year has passed.</p>
<p>Now, the sun rises straight and sets early, it is autumn.</p>
<p>The young woman selling autumn jasmine flowers appears again, unharmed, between these alleys and long streets. Still the more sighing voice, and the more haggard shadow.</p>
<p>Autumn has aged her once again.</p>
<p>Hearing that sighing voice, my wanderer's feeling becomes heavier. I feel a kind of gossamer-like, light smoke of melancholy, faintly twining around my heart: my entire soul. And from there, I long for a small, sad soul. Following me, a wanderer, living alone, passing the days in silence.</p>
<p>Hearing that sighing voice, I am saddened by the alienation between people, while at the same time, I feel the intimate taste of being misunderstood by others as a lonely person.</p>
<p>Autumn goes and comes again, comes and goes again. Sending off countless autumns in this way, listening to the chirping of crickets and the sound of falling leaves on autumn days, the sunset bell of my own life has passed by delicately, passed by.</p>
<p>The landlord said: "It's that it doesn't rain, what does it have to do with me!"</p>
<h3>Side View of Autumn</h3>
<p>— Huiren</p>
<p>In the factory, the whistle, in the quiet autumn morning, howls wildly, breaking through the black sky, penetrating the layers of increasingly white clouds in the treetops to the east; the morning breeze blows on the flat, shining asphalt road, stirring the leaves falling from the plane trees, the sound is unusually weak.</p>
<p>People shrinking their necks, dragging their heavy steps with a lack of energy, step on the leaves quickly, yet weakly, heading towards the place emitting black smoke. A piece of drowsy-seeming weariness still covers people's faces; when a branch of dim light shoots down from the treetops, they close their eyes as if unable to resist; yellow like a carved plaster statue, almost having lost their emotions; the women's heads still retain the mark of last night's labor, a thin layer of yellowish fluff, enough to show that their time is rushed, not allowing for the slightest opportunity to tidy up and adorn themselves.</p>
<p>Stepping onto the ferry, one feels the silence of the world, the coldness of the surging river water, the coolness of the river wind blowing on the face, almost everything is like death. In the silence, thoughts surge in people's minds, chewing over the dreams they haven't finished yet, and estimating their own lives; but these, which always become questions in people's minds, only turn into a kind of nameless anger, surging like the morning tide.</p>
<p>They are aware that autumn has arrived! A cruel, ruthless, and also angry season, they cannot see the other side of autumn, the side that is gentle; joyful, moving; just as the people of that side of autumn cannot see the coldness, ruthlessness, and anger of autumn.</p>
<p>They are forever separated, as if by an iron wall.</p>
<h3>When Lonely</h3>
<p>— Lu Yin Quan</p>
<p>Arriving in Nanjing, like a dried-up well, my heart became as desolate as a dried-up well. Hiding in a small attic room, immersed in the overflowing dim light, I feel strangely lonely, what shall I do? In the past, I used to be very fond of solitude, because its faint sweetness was indeed enough for one to savor carefully; but now, I not only do not enjoy</p>
