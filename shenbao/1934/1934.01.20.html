<p>（一）甲午之前。日人處心積慮。以謀朝鮮。朝鮮遂亡。其後銖積寸累以謀滿洲。而傀儡組織以成。今則得隴望蜀。又將染指於華北。吾人試留心觀察日人行事之微端末節。往往見其龑意所在卽如九一八前日人著書立。論多以[鮮][滿]並提。今則時時以[鮮][滿]與[北支]聯稱。又如其全國畫報之封面插圖。向多滿洲古跡。今亦代以華北名。勝[履霜堅冰。]其來有自。竊恐華北之視滿洲。將如滿洲之視朝鮮。日來頻傳溥儀不久稱帝。識者謂此事之内幕。非爲[滿洲國]執政之改帝制。而實爲[淸國]廢帝之圖復辟。日人從中主動。更爲有目者所共鑒。似此陰謀野心。層出不窮。未來隱憂。正不知伊於胡底。且遠東國際形勢。亦日趨緊張。今日已盛傳一九三六年將不免於危機之說。屆時無論其爲日美戰爭。或日俄戰爭。我國斷不能置身局外。祇就我國今日之現狀而言。試問將何以安渡此未來之難關。</p>
<p>（二）農村破産。工商衰落。民生不安。匪亂頻仍。皆爲當今嚴重之問題。亟待解决。顧以軍事力置掃除外表之惡勢力。僅爲治標。欲圖治本。則首在政治之改善政治淸明。則人民安居樂業。不致甦而走險。農工商業。亦得納入正軌。徐圖發展。去年海關入超達九萬萬元之鉅。足爲生産與消費二者不能調劑之瞪。國民經濟之前途。何堪設想。謀國是者。當知對症下藥。務其大者。</p>
<p>（三）今世國家之政體。無論爲[德謨克拉西]或獨裁。其治權皆不外屬於一政治之集團。如欲此集團發揮其效能。非有主義組織與幹部人才三要素不可。今日國民黨之要務。在加强其組織。團結其幹部人才。形成一整個有力之集團。而後乃得實施其主義。負荷對内對外應盡之使命。此外又當羅致黨外人才。博採民意。以共赴國難。</p>
<p>總之目前國脈民命。百孔千瘡。都待補救。實已臨到最後關頭。在此四全大會開幕之始。應如何籌商應付此[非常時]之實際辦法。國人莫不引領以望。政府諸領袖其作最後之努力。</p>

<p>歐洲戰爭恐慌</p>
<p>法國對德疑慮</p>
<p>公約未成不能裁軍</p>
<p>參院表决信任政府</p>
<p>（巴黎）參院今日辯論外交事務曾討論戰爭之可能性但非在太平洋而在歐洲本身總理旭丹稱當各國正在重整軍備之際法國斷不能裁减其陸軍减少軍備僅能在將來訂定公約後實行之云發言者數人表示信念謂他日德國如事侵略英國必出援法國如一九一四年然旭丹聲明法國陸軍决不减少後參院遂以大多數通過信任政府案共投二百五十七票反對者僅三票耳（十八日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）參議院討論外交問題質問案業已終結外交委員會主席貝朗熱提出動議主張忠守國聯會盟約及羅卡洛條約並信任政府俾能在國聯會範圍以内從事和平建設使法國與各國國交趨於親善並鞏固國防及安全此項動議以二五七票對三票之多數通過</p>
<h3>對德民族不爲已甚</h3>
<p>在投票以前總理旭當更將外長彭古演說之要點重述一過略謂法國對各民族之主權素來重視斷無干涉德國内政之理旭當繼稱德人造作蜚語誣衊法國以期激動德國人民之國家思想此於該國外交政策上必有發生反響之危險須知自歐戰終結以後法國對德退讓至再至三法國之意無非表示希望和平之志願且以爲德國有權恢復其大國地位故對於德國民族不爲已甚使之難堪不料德國竟不了解當日内瓦軍縮會議行將得到全體同意之解决時德國突然出會此種舉動能不令人疑懼乎</p>
<h3>法國安全祇有兩道</h3>
<p>法國對於國家安全認爲僅有兩途可走如不自恃其力卽須依賴國際合作此種見解實有至理不可視爲矛盾吾人所謂縮减軍備者乃謂俟一般軍縮公約成立後再照公約所定辦法實行裁軍而言非謂目前法國卽應裁减軍備蓋此時尙有他國正在重整軍備也</p>
<h3>英法妥恊和平砥柱</h3>
<p>旭當繼稱法國與各與國始終維持其密切之妥恊對於其他各大國與法國無密切之妥恊而爲法國安全之主要因素者亦增進親善關係如英國卽其一例也吾人與英國之妥恊日益鞏固實爲世界和平之一砥柱由此言之則國際合作實於國防政策大有裨益</p>
<h3>國聯盟約始終忠守</h3>
<p>旭當言至國聯會問題時謂法國對國聯會盟約始終忠守卽使修改盟約盟亦當以國際合作爲條件且在國聯會之中不當由各大國另成一種主幹機關至關於軍縮問題之直接談判乃係以軍縮會議前次散會時最後之結果爲根據不當軼出國聯會盟約範圍之外以故目下雖可由各國單獨談判然結局仍當以軍縮會議爲歸宿終之各國儘可進行談判但無論如何不能以重整軍備爲目的耳世界和平當以各民族互相信賴爲根基至各國勢力暫時之平衡與一般恐怖之心理則皆不可恃爲和平之基礎也旭當結論要求國會畀以必要權力以便進行渠所宣布之政策各議員聞言勢烈鼓掌賴米利爲提出質問案最重要議員之一於總理詞畢之後宣言總理旭當已允許對於法國軍力之不加縮减至是乃將貝朗熱所提之信任政府案提付表决贊成者二五七票反對者三票政府勝利（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>江浙蠶絲事業論（續）</h3>
<p>沈文煒</p>
<p>對於蠶絲業改革之意見大槪可以分爲急進綏進二派緩進派以學校及政府機關爲代表主張從改良蠶種及練絲機械以减輕成本及提商品質價值而與日本競爭急進派則以莫觴淸先生之統制貿易生産及原料價格而至國際市塲傾銷而謀得生絲之出路再逐漸從事技術之改良至於近年來關於蠶絲業技術上之改良確有相當成效如改良蠶種製造枚數之激增在無錫方面改良藕在繅絲上之成效亦頗顯著以及飼育秋蠶之勃興浙江方面近二之年來飼育秋蠶亦漸見發達實爲水能掩飾之事實而蠶絲業之衰落如故者其原因實由於極複雜之經濟關係所致而莫觴淸先生之統一江浙皖絲廠之計劃係莫君多年經營生絲貿易之經騐將生絲貿易之重要告知吾人關於莫君之計劃約分爲四點（一）賣出（卽貿易）卽以統制貿易之方法以防止日本之操縱市塲而增進貿易競爭之力量（二）實進卽統制原料繭之價格以免盲目之競爭（三）生産卽特别注意原料及工作之分配生絲品質之統一以適應大規模絲織廠之需要以及能率之增進原料之節省而謀成本之减少（四）銀根（卽金融計劃）其計劃要求中央發行公債五百萬元分給各絲廠更由繅絲業者投資二百五十萬元兩人共七百五十萬元以此欵項爲墊欵而銀錢業息借三千萬元共計三千七百五十萬以此欵項收貿江浙皖三省所産之繭莫君之計劃確有補救技術之不足然金融是否足與日本競爭則頗爲疑問</p>
<p>作者於民國十六年著作[中國蠶絲業與社會化經營（該稿於民十七將板權售於上海新學會社後因該社遭火災致將該稿焚去旋於民國二十年重訂然當此書業不景氣時至今未能發行）建議中國蠶絲業經營之體系化復於民十七著發展浙江蠶絲業意見]當程振鈞先生長浙江建設廳時代提出同時分贈譚仲逵周君梅諸先生無如因當時經濟環境關係未予採納於今思之猶不勝遺恨</p>
<p>所謂蠶絲業經營體系者卽對於蠶絲業有關係之各部門置於一大經營體之下加以合理之處置如原料政策生産管理貿易方法金融計劃以及農村經濟之改善提高工農及其子弟之敎育與一般文化水凖尤注重經營之濃化集中生産提高工作效能以及經營之合成卽同時經營與蠶絲業有關係之各事業如製作機械建築銀行保險絹絲紡織榨取蛹油以爲五金燃料日用品之生産購買以及消費等合作以减少生産成本强調競爭之力量</p>
<p>六復興中國蠶絲業之途徑及方法自民十七至現在蠶絲業之情勢已經大變民十七時絲業雖雖不景氣之階級但尙能勉强維持現在則因恐慌愈益尖銳至國絲廠紛紛停業農民有剷除桑園改其他植物之議吾人講求維持之不暇遑論擴充茲爲恢復蠶絲業舊觀起見特提供以下之經營意見</p>
<p>吾國蠶絲業之衰落原因殊爲複雜其中主因爲世界經濟恐慌但在中國尤有特殊之原因例如日本生絲之操縱市塲以及匯兌關係技術幼稚等等改吾人欲謀蠶絲業之復興須從整個經濟政治謀得解决惟茲事體大不易進行故只得消極的從蠶絲業内在諸問題加以處理以期得到一個解决之辦法</p>
<p>最近日本蠶絲業因絲價急激之變動故一部份小規模廠家亦陷於停頓狀態農民爲謀得産繭之出路遂相率組織製絲組合卽吾國所謂合作繅絲關於合作繅絲之利益約可分作以下幾點（一）農民所産之繭得根據合作原則廢除從來一般營業繅絲之利瀾制度故有提高繭價之可能（二）生繭之價格須依照全年平均絲價計算故不受絲價變動之影響而能安定蠶絲業之經營（三）生産成績之優劣因與參加作生産者有密切之關係故可促進蠶絲業之技術的向上惟日本之合作繅絲以前因規模太小全年工作日數太少且在營業繅絲之黄金時代故未見如何發達最近因種種刺激大加整頓而取得養蠶繅絲販賣上之聯絡故能與一般營業繅絲相競爭吾人欲謀蠶絲業之復與亦惟有採擇此一途徑吾國全作繅絲實以浙江德淸縣西葑漾秿慕陶先生經營之利農絲廠爲蒿矢但當時該廠因尙未採取蒸汽機且工人之技術不熟練以及辦事不善故不僅影響繭價之低落且引起農民之誤會而未獲得農民之信任故遭失敗其次則爲蕭山東鄕蠶絲合作社無錫華新製絲養成所杭州緯成公司等以上各廠均係採用特約養蠶組合制度而非澈底之合作繅絲故當此絲價變動激烈之際不免仍有投機之危險尤以繅絲技術關係致影響繭價之低落加之結算繭價沒有凖確之法或因經營者之自私而不公充在所難免其不能取得農民之信仰實爲必然現在採用此項制度之各廠除無錫華新外其餘均因營業不振相繼停業</p>
<p>合作繅絲最困難之問題莫如確定繭之價值（品質上的）價格及付欵方法繭之價值係視繭層量之多寡解舒之易難（難解舒之繭直接影響於生産之能率低落）以及品質之優劣繭之價值在日本普通用口挽（試繅樣繭）或特殊之試騐方法行之口挽法即以試繅之結果以算出繭之價值而特種試騐法則利用檢查繭層量之器械以及試騐解舒之化學的反應等方法以計算之關於此等技術上之問題非數語所能詳盡恕不贅述至於價格雖須根據價值但仍須根據平均絲價以算出之期特點在於根據全年之平均絲價或總平均每担絲之價格以决定之其品質價值不齊之繭則與予一定之增减不如營業繅絲根據一時的絲價及不合理之方法而决定故在合作繅絲絕無投機和危險惟吾人不得不注意者厥爲付欵之辦法現在農村之貧乏已達極點故對於現金之需要當極緊迫於是在産繭時期必須付一部份現金在日本對於此項預付之現金稱之謂[假渡金]意卽假定價格之預付欵項其數目約爲繭價總數百分之七十乃至八十而在日本合作繅絲之資本須由參加合作繅絲之人員集合尤能利用産業組合中央金庫及借貸組合等便利金融之週轉在吾國則欲集合此項資本殊爲困難且如上述之金融機關目前除農工銀行外極少此項組織故須政府之補助或設法担保金融之流通方能成功茲擬江浙合作繅絲初期試行之原則於右</p>
<p>（一）利用現存之工塲在日本組合繅絲之工塲通常由民農集資建築然照目前我國農村金融狀况實無此項投資之可能故爲積極復興蠶絲業計不得不利用現存之工塲以期輕面易舉此項工塲由江浙蠶絲當局擇一定之養蠶區域就近之繅絲工塲爲合宜但爲貿易上便利計初期試行繅絲車數以二千台至三千台爲限俟有成效則次第增加政府並應訂定助長此項合作繅絲之規定</p>
<p>（二）金融假定被指定之合作繅絲車爲二千台平均每月繅絲約四百五十担至五百五十担每担約須墊欵洋三百元一二個月約計繅絲一千担計流通資本約三十萬元平均絲車每台約須政府補助或墊借洋一百五十元至於農民生産之繭預付假定時價之百分之七十乃至八十之現金政府對於此項現金應負担保流通之責任然合作繅絲因無投機之危險故信用當然可以穩固如經營至有成績時銀行當樂於放欵</p>
<p>（三）合作繅絲成立後由江浙蠶絲當局組織合作繅絲管理委員會負監督金融業務指導合作方法及技術之改進並代理販賣生産物以及宣傳合作之利益等職務</p>
<p>七結語綜觀以上各點合作繅絲因原料價格合理的决定故對於絲價之變動有强大之抵抗力而具有充分經營之可能性金融方面因經營穩固入信用隨之加强尤以合作繅絲係根據無利潤之原則故只要能保持現在技術之水凖則農民所産之生繭代價已能相當提高目農民養蠶成績之優劣與農民有接直利害關係加之合作繅絲之工人大都爲農民之子弟故必能促進養蠶繅絲技術之改良同時合作繅絲爲促進技術之改良故對於合作繅絲下之農民工人施行相當敎育農工子弟之敎育亦包刮在内因之得提高一般社會之文化水凖同時合作繅絲爲與農民切實聯合起見故必須盡力增加衛生及娛樂之設備以增進社會之福利</p>
<p>惟在合作繅絲初辦時期對於原料繭之價值及價格之决定必須凖確及公允以增進農民之好感而免發生誤解同時必須促進技術之改良以提高繭之價格尤須與農民親切之聯絡及解說以獲得農民之信任而而鞏固合作繅絲之基礎</p>

<p>孔氏首談關於財部在此次全會所提之整頓田賦一案書面文字雖經飭員擬就因余仍有意見增加故尙未完全脫稿惟日内當可竣事卽向大會提出至於提出此案之動機純在鑒於各省田賦附加之複雜農民不勝負擔惟各省所增設之某項附加有爲某項之正當用途者亦有非必要正用者均宜查其性質凡非正當者亟應取銷其因有正用而不得不設者雖亦應廢除之但當别爲設法以資補救而期劃一此案提出全會後在大會中當可决定一原則至詳細辦法則</p>
<p>仍須財部切實規定</p>
<h3>一萬萬公債</h3>
<p>旋記者叩以一萬萬</p>
<p>新公債之發行事</p>
<p>據答一萬萬新公債之發行純爲償還中央銀行之積欠緣年來政府回中行撥借之欵已積欠至一萬萬二千萬元今以全</p>
<h3>黄旭初氏北來</h3>
<p>在粤中委黄旭初氏已於十五日由廣西啓程於十九日抵港黄氏當於昨晚登大來輪公司克利扶倫總統號輪今晨由港啓程來滬約於二十二日晨可抵埠黄氏抵滬後當晚卽入京出席四中全會至中委李福林氏則於昨晨七時半乘坐大來輪公司威爾過總統號輪由港抵滬亦於昨晚夜快車入京尙有關素人·鄧靑陽·李綺菴·三氏現决中止北來</p>
<h3>粤委提案内容</h3>
<p>粤委十五人聯名提案頗爲外間所注意蓋一般人對此提案似有一種誤會以爲粤方所提之改革現行政制案旣根據胡漢民氏之八項主張必必將提議改組現政府及取消軍委會等但據崔廣秀氏昨語記者謂提案内容並無此等主張不過在軍事主面主張軍人不得干政軍隊在平時由軍事機關訓練在戰事時期完全聽政府之指揮調動至關於保障人民言論出版集會結社諸自由亦盡載於其中至關於胡氏宣言中所主張中央與地方實行均權制度一節則另有一提案卽前日本人所言之粤方第二提案劃分全國爲若干訓政區是也該案主張應多設各地政府委員會但以分治合作爲原則云云</p>
<p>部償諸中行猶不敷二千萬故發行後並不流通市面於債市更無絲毫影響</p>

<p>[中日兩國聯好可保東半球的和平]大陸的發展是中國的責任[今後惟望彼此互相信托…以解决印度問題印度問題一解决則全世界有色人種皆得蘇生日本得此功績决不愁此後無移民貿易地决不作侵略中國的拙策[對大陸得絕對的保障而以全力發展於美澳才是日本民族生存發展之正路]</p>
<p>此日人桂太郎與中國革命導師孫中山先生盡傾肺腑之言也（參看戴季陶氏日本論九七頁）</p>
<p>桂太郎者日本最有權勢最具有遠見的軍人政治家先後曾組閣三次在位幾及八年日一自有内閣制度以來身任總理如此之久者未嘗有也當桂氏在位之時初則以日本新與之小邦與世界第一强大帝國丨（英國）締結攻守同盟使英國放棄其百年以來榮譽孤立之政策一以增高其國際地位一以看厚其國防實力繼則戰敗世界第一大陸帝國丨（俄國）掃世界列强鄙視東方民族之心理而又激起世界民族革命之新潮自日本維新以來能爲其國家確立如此驚人之殊動者亦未嘗有也以桂氏謀國之忠勇目光之遠大識見之卓越功勳之煊赫共爲此言自有其過人之卓見不滅之眞理日人追懷先烈記取遣訓再一究今日之國策應作如何之感感想乎</p>

<p>考日本民族之發展歷史的動力之所在不能不遠溯德川時代之治績德川時代乃中國哲學思想在日本發展之全盛時期日本民族所以得自脫於部落鬥爭的野蠻狀態而促進其民權之發展統一其政治的組織以至確立其現代國家之基礎者實不能不歸功於[仁愛]與[大同]的中國哲學思想談日本維新者每忽視此段歷史的關係而日本人民亦類都未能認識其民族文化發展之基礎以致此文化之正宗漸爲日本傳統的神權歷史學說以及民族之偏狹心理所壓抑寖假而鄙棄中國盲從歐美貪婪無饜同族相殘沉迷於中古黷武主義以爲天下之業唯尙力征乃竞自陷於帝國主義者日暮途窮之末運現在日本之一般政治家大都無遠大之計劃高超之識見致於世界人類之將來東方民族之前途以及中日兩國之關係如何共存共榮之道如何輒無暇計及卽日本民族正眞之正了路何在亦未能認識終日所惴惴自餒鰓鰓過慮者以爲中國之統一中國之解放中國之自强將碍於日本之發展有碍於帝國之生命故[一方面口口聲聲對全世界衷告中國之不統一而一方面則堅持進行其阻撓中國統一之政策]（語見顧維鈞在國聯演說詞）而不思中國民族一本其忠孝·仁愛·信義·和平·王道文化之精神厚往薄來講信修睦抑强扶弱繼絕與廢數千年來雖爲東亞惟一大國從未侵入土地滅入國家實爲東亞和平最大之保障者東京參謀本部曁外務省固不乏英明之才惜均蔽於主觀的偏見惑於目前之利害遂專作侵略中國之下策不知中國之發展[正可爲日本保障中日兩國之聯好可保東亞之和平]（日桂太郎之語）是豈僅中國之不幸實將貽日本民族無限之禍也</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>讀書計劃（二）</h3>
<p>答何永泉君並告已取得本部登記證的讀者</p>
<p>我們從許多在本部登記後的讀者來信中，看出眞的有按照本部擬定的程序，而提出讀書計劃來討論的，實在是不甚踴躍。好多的讀者根本就不注意；或不知道如何着手去擬定一個計劃，却希望另人替他代擬。有些讀者所擬就的，一看就知道是不很實踐，或者竟是完全出於無經騐的空想，或甚潦草的製作。但是，能像何永泉君這樣鄭重的從實際經騐中具體的提出的計劃，不僅足稱我們的讀者一個模範的參考，並且也提醒了我們應從如何的方向去帮助讀者。因此，我們已將何君原借一字不改的公佈了。現在再進而與何君及一般的讀者來商榷之。</p>
<p>何君整個計劃，我們是完全同意的，讀書要有計劃和做人要有打算一樣，可以决定這人的成功與失敗。自古就有不少的人雖然好學，苦攻並未得到成功，也有不少的人，雖然費時似乎不多，却獲得驚人的成果。尤其在今日科學方法成爲普遍的工具的時代，如果一不經濟，非徒一事無成，實在也就無從着手。所以本部在研究之始，就想糾正讀者散漫的態度，引導到一有條理的讀者生活道路上去。</p>
<p>[計劃]的擬定，第一要根據自已實際的需要，同不能徒憑一已的空想；第二不是寫在紙上的空談，要能實行。第三道[計劃]要顧到所學的全體，不能偏於某一部分；這[計劃]要是整個做人的全計劃中的一部份，即是他要有前途。道部份計劃完全後，一定是完成了某一階段，使你的認識更爲開展。</p>
<p>因此，樹立一個計劃，自然不是一件容易的事，你得根據你的經騐，認識的程度，同時也有提出不家來討論的必要。歡迎賦有同樣經騐人的批評。</p>
<p>以上是原則上的話。何君的計劃大致都做到了我現在不惜多費口舌，是因爲希望一般的讀者本此原則來讀何君的來信，同時對於何君亦盼自己再檢閱自己的計劃，是否完全相適合。</p>
<p>何君提出的研究中心，非常的正確。但可惜的是我們邐不詳細知道何君的學歷。依據何君提出的要點及如何進行的步驟，我敢說道光要具有相當的經濟學知識，及唯物的辯證法的理論與運用。前者沒有基礎，不能認淸資本主義經濟構造的複雜關係，獲得其本質。後者則爲方法論的問題，方法的錯誤其本質。後者則同的危險。但最大的困難還不是工具的認識，而是如何的去運用工具。道是可以苦惱許多專家們的難題。（未完）</p>

<p>第三就是設備感覺到不充分中國的大學設備大都不够工欲善其事必先利其器現代的科學尤其是需要設備的設備是研究學問重要的工具也是研究學問的重要鼓勵辦敎育的人應當節省任何費用以從事設備國家也應當盡力補助學校經費指定不爲其擴充行政之用而爲其增加設備之用中國是窮的國家我們决不是也决不當拿設備來做裝飾設備當以實際研究的工作爲對象利用設備的人也應當體念民生物力之艱難充分愛惜充分利用西洋也有幾個學者在不完備的實騐室裏倒有很好的成績以後到當麗堂皇的實騐室裏成績反不如前的現象不過就國家立塲要就不辦大學要辦大學便應當把他的設備弄好來還有因爲大學科系性質重複的太多未加整理以致同樣初級的設備太多高深的設備因經濟分散反而太少還也是很可惋惜的事</p>
<p>第四便是感受師資人選的困難這或者也是因爲大學太多的緣故中國的大學依照人口作比例當然並不算多但就延聘師資而論則中國的學者實在不敷分配因爲願意一生一世獻身於學術研究的人雖然也有却是不多這種現象不祇中國如此在中國更加上政府與學校搶人學校與學校搶人於是人才更感恐慌現在政府無論效率怎樣但是任用留學生與大學畢業生數量之多確實爲從來所未有學校經費較爲困難以致敎授待遇不及政府人員之優厚如普通大學敎授的待遇到多不過三四百元而政府薦任官吏可以高至四百元簡任官吏高至六七百元所以與其在大學作一敎授不如在政府做一個技正或科長司長大學敎授的待遇如果不能提高到相當限度要大家安心研究學問恐怕是很困難的</p>
<p>照上面說來中國的大學似乎很難辦多其實也不盡然我們祇要明白　結之的居而有整個計畫與决心以赴之是可以极本改進的大學辦不好的原因有幾點是屬於大學本身的當然應該自己去努力也有幾點是屬於大學以外的當然需要各方面的通力合作第一基本敎育該設格辦理尤其是中學因爲基礎不好補救實在困難政府對於各公私立中學也應嚴加考核去年實行會考以後各大學入學考試的成績就比較好一些這也是一個很顯明的證據同時大學對於新生的錄取也應嚴加選擇因爲大學敎育本不是普及敎育就是蘇俄的敎育計畫也祇聽見他們努力造成多少萬工業技術人才沒有聽說他們擴充多少萬大學生名額可見大學應該重質不重量質好了一個人可以抵幾個人用現在美國和日本都感覺大學生太多中國的大學生雖然不能說多但大學畢業生及其失業的比例却是很大有許多畢業生社會簡直無法容納尤其以在法科畢業的爲最多所以我主張第一步中學嚴格辦理第二步大學嚴格考錄新生每一個大學生按每年國家所費平均計算約在一千元以上道都是老百姓的血汗全國人民的担負所以國家如果不想造就人才則已否則就要使造就的人材個個精神個個有用第二辦理大學應該有確切的方針分别認淸學術的本體和環境的需要使課程的組織成爲精密而係有機體的旣定以後就須嚴格執行不以虚聲相尙不求名目好聽務使其對於民族生存問題發生密切的連鎖如是大家把課程的對象和意義認淸朾了不但可以助長學術的發展並且可使學的人也知道努力的方向第三要集中人力財力先從整頓幾個重要的大學着手政府應該下决心首先盡力發展幾個大學集中有限的財力和人力充分給與經費設備把幾個大學整頓好來以造成新的學術重心所謂轉移學風不是下幾道命令可以做到的唯一的方法是要認定幾處地方集中一批置能努力研究的學者予以較優的待遇和充分的設備讓他們以身作則天天在研究室裏做功夫做出一些榜樣給學生看使靑年知道眞正的學問是什麽是怎樣做成的不憤不啓不悱不發這種事實的昭示實在重要如果有使靑年天天目濡耳染潛移默化於道種濃厚的學術空氣之中自然能够與奮自然能够走到學術建設的路上去自然能有好的學風發生如是能通籌全國大學之内容設置把各黨複的院系予以合理化也可以使人材經濟都寛裕得多譬如某一都會共有六個心理學系分設各大學之中對於心理學可谓注重每系學生人數都很有限敎授却也要有相當人數方能分担各種應開的功課以致許多很好的學者每耗費精力於担任初級課程研究的時間自然少了這也是經濟人材經費之道值得注意的</p>
<p>現在大學生的不能得到社會的信用或者有人責備社會不好以爲社會沒有同情不肯扶植甚至於排斥大學生我們站在大學方面對於這種論調也有同情但是從社會方面看起來則以爲大學生的信用所以不能樹立因爲大學太過於粗製濫造的緣故幾年來兄弟也曾參與主持幾次留學考試和與研究性質相似之學校考試感覺到外間的責備不無可以原諒的地方有一次口試的時候兄弟問到一位大學畢業生[張居正是什麽人]有人答道[司法院長]又問[于謙是什麽人]有人答道[監察院長]另問一人[井田是一種什麽制度]他說[是日本人]更問道[赤峯在何處]他說[赤峯是日本的一個海島]我們不禁喟然長嘆知道熱河之亡不祗是亡於湯玉麟大學畢業生不知道赤峯是中國的領土中國還不應該亡嗎這當然是極端的例不足以律一般但是說出來也可以供我警愓一下所以國家對於大學首先要有通盤打算繼之以嚴格辦理國家究竟需要特别發展那幾種學問造出來的人材應如何容納却應當打算進去務必人不濫造造就一個就有一個的用處不然學生畢業後就要失業一畢卽失豈不糟糕年來政治與社會之不安都是肇端於此現在社會紊亂的情形使學生在未畢業以前睜眼一望就覺害怕所以活動的在學校裏就想出種種風頭也有甘願受人利用的希望將來的出路是其中一個重要的原因甚至對於系主任和敎授的批評不以其學識而以能否將來替自己找出路爲斷這雖是例外並不盡是如此但是已經可以使學術前途發生悲觀了</p>
<p>從前曾國藩談用人注意三事（一）爲轉移之道（二）爲培養之方（三）爲考察之法經過以上三點才能訓練出一個眞正的人材現在的學校至多不過做到轉移和培養的一部份工作進一步的培養和考察在於靑年任事以後而在紊亂的社會之中不問個人的人格學問只問其背景如何誰人介紹有何力量這樣社會的組織眞是危險極了用人自然不限於政府一般社會也能容納許多人材所以不但須一般國家的事業發達並且須一般社會的事業發展方能解决大學畢業生的出路問題如美國的一般大學畢業生都不願意走到政治路上去就是因爲工商業方面發展的機會很多而且前途的希望較好大家何必擠到政府裏去搶飯吃譬如福特一個人他公司裏的人員就有幾萬人全世界各生要都市都有他的分公司和辦事處比公使館領事館還要闊氣他宛如終身的小諸侯何必定要做總統但在中國則不然中國各種事業太不發達而官廳很發達並且許多官廳裏職員旣多事務較輕報酬亦較豐於是一般人受了敎育之後都不願到農村裏去都願意集中都市明明知道失業很痛苦但是失業也願等候明白知道職業不穩定但是可以舒服一天還是舒服一天像這樣情形不但政治不安而且社會道德也一天一天的墮落下去假使各種工商企業一起發達起來其希望待遇都較官廳爲好則靑年自然望風景從其精力有所發洩其事業心也可以發展卽有領袖慾的人也可知藉此發揮用不到大家擠到政治界裏去你爬在我背上我爬在你背上結果一齊掉下深坑同歸於盡至於新事業可以吸收大部分的人材是顯著的事實例如新近通車的杭江鐵路就可證明有天曾養甫先生和我說杭江鐵路任用國内外的大學畢業生約有四百人請看一條六百三十公里的輕軌鐵道已經可以容納這許多人則其他較大規模的事業自然不必說了這一二年來有一個可注意的現象就是大學農工理三科的畢業生出路較好而政治經濟法律等系的畢業生則特别感到就事的困難因此這幾年來靑年升學的趨出也有改變投考理農工三科的人比投考文法科的人來得多北方的大學有此現象南方的大學也有此現象這是個健康的徵兆這還是因爲近年政府東設農塲西設農塲南造公路北造公路的緣故專　政府總是有限的若是社會上各種事業一齊發達起來那前途更可樂觀了蘇敎廳令發各縣</p>

<h3>職業敎育報告</h3>
<p>（十）</p>
<p>（丙）高級職業訓練</p>
<p>法國之高級職業學校爲國立工藝院全法國共有六所分設於Aix-enProvince·Angers·t·halousour-Marne·Clung·Lille及Paris最早者成立於一七七六年在Straseburg之國立工程學校亦爲同等程度之學校也</p>
<p>國立工藝院之學科以造就工程人員及主任工程師爲目的學程爲三年每年考試一次以爲學生升級標凖入學須經考試成績優良者多自國立職業學校或程试較高之實用學校及中等學校出身每年新生以一百人爲限國立工藝院之課程頗偏重於工塲訓練每日工塲實習必有五小時其他製圖及工程學科僅二小時是爲特點畢業學生於實用學識均有充分修養宜乎爲工業界所歡迎錄用也</p>
<p>國立工藝研究院及工藝師範學校亦屬於高級職業敎育機關前者攢挈工藝學術之所後者則爲職業師範坻學校爲訓練實用學校師資之所也</p>
<p>（三）私立職業學校</p>
<p>各級技術人員分類至細範圍又廣故在訓練與敎育責任至爲煩重政府力量兼顧難周勢不得不藉私人之力以爲之助前已言之法國私立職業學校亦有特異之點政府視其成績如何給予補助費以鼓勵而兼監督之私立職業學校亦分三類</p>
<p>（甲）藝術訓練</p>
<p>凡具遠大眼光之實業界領帝知職業訓練關於國家社會經濟之重要有在工廠内設立學校訓練蕶徒或由會所公團共同舉辦如鐵道局汽車廠商會等皆早經設立此項學校雇主公會及工人團體則有設立技術班以爲各界各業藝徒修習學問之地此項技術班日見增加成績優良者亦可得政府之補助以經常支出百分之五十爲最高限度同時亦受政府之監督</p>
<p>（乙）中級職業訓練</p>
<p>中級職業訓練學校或訓練班由私人創立者亦以工廠商會等爲多與藝徒訓練相似</p>
<p>（丙）高級職業訓練</p>
<p>高級職業學校之私立者有（一）中央工藝制造學校該校成立已百年以訓練工程人員爲主（二）高等商科學校以各地商會設立者爲多（專科學院專科學院除私立者亦有附設於大學者高級工程人員之訓練每分爲二部中央工藝學校及國立工藝學校授第一部訓練以普通工程學識爲主學程爲三年各專科學院則授第二部以專門學識爲重惟專科発守亦有兼授二部課程者私立專科學校之著名者有巴黎之高等鑄工（翻砂）學校里昻之製革學校羅恩化學院慕羅高等紡織學校巴黎之光學院高等電氣學校及高等航空學校等附設於各大學者有朗西大學之電機冶金釀造等科格林諾爾大學之電機與製紙科里立大學之電機與化工科私立專科學院·或學校經調查確實及高等職業敎育委員會之證明確有成績者由敎育部職業敎育司年給補助費以奬勵之</p>
<p>（四）法國農業敎育</p>
<p>法國自革命後政府於農業敎育已着手規劃一八四八年規定每省設農業學校一所每區設農學院及農事師範各一所一八七九年規定每省及市委任農業敎員任省市之農事敎育一九一二年更規定每省設農業指導員一人專從事於農業學識之普及如學校農業功課農業推廣班農業試騐塲等（除獸醫林塲外）皆在其管轄權之内也每省委定農業銊敎授一人或數人襄助指導員編訂講義舉行農事講演以求灌輸知識於一般民而其功效亦頗顯著</p>
<p>然一九一八年八月之法令規定餘農業學校外並須設立農業推廣班農業流動班冬季農業學校等專爲鄕村靑年子弟及農塲工人與以入學機會則其功效更要且宏矣故照現行制度農業敎育之推廣有下列各級學校及講習班㈠國立農學院（巴黎）㈡國立農業學校㈢農業學校㈣冬季農校㈤農業推廣班及流動班</p>
<p>國立農學院（巴黎）該院爲普通農業敎育最高深之學校凡中學畢業生須經考試及格方得入學每年招新生約一百人而投考者常在五百人以上敎員約四十人皆經過考試由政府任命者學程爲二年欲更求深造者得入朗西之河工森林學校或農部設立之農業訓練部預備爲農業或蒔藝敎員或農業受農塲工人及管理員訓練或理化自然科學部研究科學應用於農菜合作部訓練訓練爲工會保險放欵農業合作社等之主任人員該院設有牛奶工程專部以研究製奶製油製酪等問題學生在校習理論功課完竣後必須赴全國製奶製油工廠考察以得實地經騐焉</p>

<h3>化整爲零與化零爲整</h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>把實足七錢一分五厘重的一塊雪白大洋錢，向烟兌店的櫃上一把放，換了六個雙角，十個銅子。這是化整爲零。論理，物質是不滅的大洋錢旣可化整爲零而爲銀角與銅子，那麽，有了六個雙角與十個銅子，當然可以化零爲整，而爲一塊大洋錢。但，事實上，不這麽。化整爲零，不成問題，若要化零爲整，那就非在六個雙角，十個銅子之外，再加上從腰包裏挖出來的三個或是五個銅子兒，便休想可以化零爲整，而換得一塊雪白大洋錢。</p>
<p>上述的一個化整爲零的例子，只須你肯挖腰包，補貼水，願吃一些兒小虧，究竟還可以做到化零爲整的地步，不至於完全絕望。不過我們該明白化整爲零的嚴重性，不就是這一些兒。再舉一個例。譬如整整的一疋面，可裁製三件衣服，這也是化整爲零之一種。而在這一個化整爲零的公式之下所化成的零，便永久是零，而不再有化零爲整的可能性了。</p>
<p>的一二年來，[化整爲零]四個字，在我們的東北義勇軍的報告中時常可以見到，而且大家都愛接着說一句[待有機會，再化零爲整]。</p>
<p>話果然是說得輕鬆平淡，而且是冠冕堂皇，但是一疋布旣剪成了二截，便永不能再成爲一整疋了。就是退一步說，六個雙角，十個銅子，再加上一些貼水，還可以勉强化零爲整，而爲一塊大洋錢，可是在實際上呢，六個雙角，十個銅子，僅值九角八分而已，一塊雪白大洋錢，這麽整而零，零而整的化下去，不也就完了麽？</p>
<p>這倒是一個富於謎性的問題。</p>
<h3>關於兩姓的稱呼</h3>
<p>— 陳韜</p>
<p>這一篇東西所談的全是關於男女朋友方面的。不知幾時曾在本刋上看到過一篇談稱謂的文字，裏邊曾說到稱呼在異性方面，最普通的是[先生][女士]而漸漸地會變到[哥哥][妹妹]的。（大槪是這樣的意思，原文已忘。）其實，稱呼在異性方面眞複雜呢；第一次丨最一般的稱[女士]正如稱[先生]一樣。但是在對男性方面第二三次就可以改稱[××兄]，再進一步則可單寫一個名字也不要緊；這對於信的内容或感情交誼並沒有多大差别，稱了[兄]或名字不一定兩個人已愛到怎樣程度的。不過對於女子方面，似乎還是有些不可能，似乎還是有些不方便：第一次稱女士後，第二次並不可能在接着就是[×姊][×妹]或單寫一個名字。要是機械地照樣寫去，人們丨對方一定要當你犯精神病了吧？</p>
<p>這丨稱呼在西人或者是比較特别些，他們或伊們初次給人們通信就稱人爲Mydear！或Dear…而自稱爲Your…我想要是把它搬來對初次認識中國異性朋友去使用，寫成什麽[我親愛的…]或[親愛的…]而自我的稱爲[你底…]那麽人們是一定要當你在發情狂或色痴了。</p>
<p>中間似乎有一層壁壘在，我覺得。</p>
<p>[何嘗有壁壘…]有一個朋友他曾給我這樣辯言過：[中國人丨尤其是現在靑年男女是頂會用稱呼的，伊或他是一步一步地進化着的，第一次亦不一定要用[女士][先生]丨要是先認識的話；以後則大半是由男子先來改變而同時請求對方亦改變丨花樣景眞多：什麽[美麗的小鳥]，[可愛的薔薇]；[偉大的老虎]亦同樣地會産生的。[我最親愛的…][你心底裏的]，[我夢裏的人兒][你不可忘却的]這種肉麻的字眼，在現在已經不大有人用了，現在頂流行祇用名字，更親愛的是用一個字，譬如伊名[苔莉]那麽就可單寫一個[莉]字，這是更親愛的。這是比稱什麽DearDarling好得多呢！]</p>
<p>自然這亦是跟了他倆的感情而轉變的，不然稱女士祇好稱到底，你想改些花樣稱伊什麽[小鳥][薔薇]伊會不理你]他似乎體騐到一般的補充着。</p>
<p>哈哈……稱呼亦進化了，似乎是表情的工具的一種，摩登靑年們！是不是？</p>
<h3>歲暮遣懷</h3>
<p>— 建新</p>
<p>寥落心期可奈何。年華錦瑟半銷磨。無窮恩怨償難了。有限狂名累轉多。荆布憐伊安淡泊。挐鱸愧我計蹉跎。傷心欲下深閨拜。老去樊英涕涙沱。</p>
<p>人情冷眼幾個回看。得失紛紜一彈丸。謗譽交侵增愛詭。愆尤叢集笑啼難。從來涉世愁懷璧。自判當門誤種閘。湖海風波經已慣。孤蓬原久繫雕闌。</p>
<p>往事閒尋意惘然。銀塘碧月倍纒綿。偶參禪理三千偈。亦寫香奩一二篇。鴻雪無端留爪印。雲泥至竟判人天。記從閣筆黄花候。踢斷秋江又幾年。</p>
<h3>[展覽會]靜觀</h3>
<p>在上海，市塲上的[大减價]是終年不斷的。跟着每一個節氣的開始，就有一種新的名義來舉行廉價：報紙上的是不斷地登載着這類廣告：街頭遮天蔽日地懸掛起各種旗幟，迎風飄揚。閑來跑向街頭，你耳目所及的，都是熱閙，燦爛，輝煌，使你目迷心醉的情景。可是這些情景所表演的是一種什麽意義呢？稍爲懂得一點社會狀况的人會告訴你：這一種起勁的廉價競賣，正是一種社會經濟衰疲的象徵。</p>
<p>一切生産的無政府狀態，這正是資本主義社會的特徵；生産過剩，自然不能不想盡方法尋求出路。而在這種無情的尖銳的競爭之中，有多少小資本的商人，因爲被傾軋而遭遇悲慘的運命的，我們也正不難想象而得。</p>
<p>過去不少文藝作品當中，曾經有描寫到這一種情形的，例如新文學家茅盾君的[林家舖子]，也就是這一類的作品。在銀幕上，這類作品却實在少見，不久以前，上海公映過一張美國片[生意經]；在國産片中，則我們在新近才看到了僅有的一張[展覽會]。</p>
<p>[展覽會]是明星影片公司的出品，故事：大體上和[林家舖子]非常相像。它描寫小鎭上的一家雜貨舖，以一個忠厚的小商人作爲主人翁，全片非常緊張地展開了商業競爭的塲面：封建勢力的壓迫，剥削，同行的傾軋，經濟的威脅，終於使他的舖子倒閉，主人翁遭受了最悲慘的運命。</p>
<p>無疑的，這種暴露的作品有着他特殊的意義。我們正可以從銀幕上去認識：我們目前所處的是一個怎麽樣的社會。</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十三回</p>
<p>創痛難堪凝神聽鼓樂</p>
<p>歡情未洽促别飛符到</p>
<p>自己解釋着道：這也不必去怪他，大槪中國人對於丘八，總是厭惡的間接直接，都吃過軍人的虧，所以提到軍人，各人心裏就不好受，其實積之也不是不滿意我的兒子，就說那些話，他不但不應當駡我兒子，而且他受過我兒子的提携，正應當感謝我兒子呢。我何必爲了這樣幾句閑話，把自己氣壞了，那是何苦？自己心裏糊裏糊塗的走進屋來，貤不曾把街門關上，倒不要誤了大事。於是口裏啣了旱烟袋，慢慢的走到前面院子來，打算去關上大門。這時，却聽到江氏道：院子裏脚步響，是小林關大門去了吧？老太爺還沒有回來，聽說是和甘二爺一塊兒逛西山去了。又聽到桂枝說，這位老先生，倒有這分子興致。甘二爺可是個嶄新的人物，和他們怎麽談的到一塊兒去。江氏道：在你眼裏看來，總覺得甘積之不錯。其實也沒有什麽了不得，混到現在，還是窮得光棍一個，要不是我們姑爺給他找上這樣敎書的事，也許還要餓飯呢。桂枝的聲音，忽然加重了一倍，答道：你幹嗎那樣遭踏人！只這一句話，屋子裏寂然了。趙翁心想，這可奇怪，我們這位未過門的少奶奶，竟是有些帮甘積之的忙。他也不到前面關街門去了，趕緊跑回裏面院子去，自坐在椅子上，又緩緩的抽起旱烟來。到了次日，他悄悄的進城去，打了一個電報給自强，讓他快快回家完婚。一面就邀集親友，加緊籌備喜事起來。電報打去後的第五天，趙自强帶了一挑行李，走回家裏來了。（二九六）</p>

<h3>[商業競賣]與[名士才情]</h3>
<p>— 徐𢡟庸</p>
<p>沈從文先生說：[名士才情與商業競賣相結合，便成立了吾人今日對於海派這個名詞的槪念]。我看這是不對的。[名士才情]與[商業競賣]其實是[結合]不起來的兩種東西。自來名士最鄙商人，商人最疏名士，因爲名重風雅而以商人爲俗，商人重實利而以名士爲狂。而且，名士常假借官僚的勢力削商人最爲商人所憎。兩者根本是對立的。</p>
<p>商人孜孜爲利，因水及名士的吟風弄月之高超，然今風弄月之徒多矣，而未必都是名士者，蓋未必都有官僚勢力作背景故也/構成名士的條件，不單是[才情]，比才情更重要的還是官僚勢力。所謂名士，其實是官僚或官僚門下的蔑片。官僚當得意時，無心丨丨而且不必吟風弄月，但爲博提倡風雅的名聲起見，就呌他們的篾片去吟弄，篾片大抵是有才情的人充的。但是官僚總有失意的時候，在這時候，他們無聊了，於是自己也來吟風弄月，也成了名士。例如吳子玉將軍，固一世之雄也。但在下台之後，雅興倒是不淺的。</p>
<p>以此而論，文壇上倘眞有[海派]與[京派]之别，那末我以爲[商業競賣]是前者的特徵，[名士才情]却是後者的特徵。海派文人，多半以稿費爲第一目的，故[投機取巧][見風轉舵]等醜態，誠不能免。京派文人，則或爲大學敎授，或兼政府官職，憑藉官僚機關而生活，基礎鞏固，薪金豐厚，自不至如海派文人之窮形極相，故亦不必[投機][看風]也。</p>
<p>商人和名士都要錢用。但商人用的錢，是直接地用手段賺來的，名士用的錢，則可來得曲折，從小百姓手中出發，經過無數機關而到名士手中的時候，腥氣已完全消失，好像離開廚房較遠的人吃羊肉一樣。名士的淸高就在此。他們的所以有够大駡商人也在此。</p>
<p>但上海到底是一個複雜的地方，[商業競賣]的海派文人，固多如過江之鯽，而[名士才情]的京派文人，也不是沒有，不過兩者實未嘗[結合]，成功一個[海京伯]大馬戲班而已。</p>
<h3>[鑑賞標準美]</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>林語堂先生說：[現在社會係男子的社會，故好畫裸體女人。女子的社會必好劃裸體男子，亦必美其名曰：[鑑賞標準美]。]接着又說：[雄狗會畫，亦必認雌狗的大腿爲標凖美的極峯。雌狗劃雄狗亦然。]（論語三十期我的話。）用生物學的眼光來解釋藝術的根柢，一般道德家固不免驚爲失態；但哲學家和藝術家所不能解答的，在這裏却找到了滿意的答復。尼采說，[美與醜，統可用生物學的意義來解釋。]就是這個意思。、</p>
<p>人體一到了靑春期，因爲内分泌的滋潤，發生了幾種特殊表徵：胸部突然抒展，臀部發育成爲弧形，語音非常柔軟，毛髮潤澤有光彩；這都是美的重要寄託。[人體美，和第二性器官保持密切的關聯，乃是不能否認的實事。DeGonrmont說：[試問蝦蟆，何者爲美？牠將告訴你：牠的配偶最美，丨丨小的頭上突出了二隻大而圓的眼，還粗大而平闊的嘴，黄的腹部，櫻色的背部。]例之於人，其理相通。</p>
<p>但是國人爲什麽諱言[人體美]呢？因爲正人君子大都很敏感，一提到性的器官，就浮起猥褻的觀念。魯迅先生說從前的才子，祗要檢到一塊手帕，就可以相思賦詩。而牡丹亭的杜麗娘，祇夢見一個男人，便單戀至死。在道德提防下，必然有此戀態心理；這種人當然不敢正視[人體美]。還有一些色情狂的，看了街頭猥褻的畫片，輪船上猥褻的磁器賈寶玉式的病男子，林黛玉式的病美人，實行所謂[兩性醜態]，卽以爲人體美不過如是如是；這種人更不能了解[人體美]。對於美的鑑賞，國人去健康的標凖還差得很遠呢！</p>
<p>近來談世道人心者日多，說來說去，無非要提倡舊道德；凡舊道德戕賊人性人體的罪孽，一筆表過不提。我却以爲惟普及生物學的知識，正面對着事實，不加以歪曲的解釋，方能使世道人心漸有轉機。達爾文著人類由來，說：[據我們所能判斷的，大多數動物，其所表示的美的好尙，專限於誘引異性。]且引一種鳥名Bower-bird的築巢事實爲證。凡所以使道德家橋舌不下的，在生物學上正是平淡無奇，無待疑訝的。</p>
<p>有人以爲林語堂先生故作奇論，乃引申其意以明之如右。</p>
<h3>病</h3>
<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>妻病了。</p>
<p>整天地整夜地躺在床上，那樣子就像睡神攝去了她的靈魂，儘她睡上一整年，她都不會說睡的日子太多了。只有吃飯時，算是她僅有的離開床頭的時間。這麽一來，一間小屋子就顯得冷淸不少，死氣沉沉地，悶的你想盡與地呼吸一品長氣都辦不到。零亂地放着的一些東西，有的蓋滿了一層灰塵，有的簡直就像是因爲沒有得到女主人經心的安放在生着悶氣。這全是因爲妻的生病，使它們失去了料理的人。一個男人，除了眼對着散亂的東西嘆氣之外，總難得那麽習慣地仔細伸地出兩手去整理整理。妻的病，肉體上確是受了很大的折磨，但她少有呻吟，哀呌的時候，大槪是怕我着急。就是這樣，我的精神上，還是起了相當的變化，以于於無論作什麽事情，總是那麽飄飄忽忽的像天空流蕩的浮雲，放不下心去，對着當前每一件事務的處置，應該取那種步驟，怎樣作，到怎樣程度才算作完，全不能在我的頭腦裏留上思索一陣的地步。有時候，在事後發覺到某一事件着手的可笑地方，愚傻地方，當眞爲自己的反常狀態担着憂。</p>
<p>妻病了，我也差不多病了。</p>
<p>可是我還是比她强一點，至少我不像她那樣的睡！而且，我還可以代她燒飯，替她打開窗子，放外面的空氣到屋子裏，讓陽光射在她的床上；我還可以盡可能地爲她說些安慰話。</p>
<p>我沒有病，我是一個好人。</p>
<p>[爲什麽就病到我的身上呢？]</p>
<p>有時，在推過飯碗還沒有躺上床的一刻，妻就這麽自言自語的說一句，她是着急的。</p>
<p>聽她的話，我那時不知怎樣回答才好，眞的，像我們這樣連吃一口飯都很費力很困難的人，怎麽還容許生病呢。有錢人才佩長病。凈是像我們這樣的人生病，恐怕一些大醫生都要沒有飯吃了。我們是看不起病的，沒有那麽多的閑錢，病長在身上，只有聽其自然。但是，我要使妻寛心才對　追，就只有裝着笑臉陪她說：</p>
<p>[不要急，幾天就會好的。]</p>
<p>這話一說出來，自己又覺得有點兒不好意思了，一個作丈夫的旣掏不然出錢爲妻子看病，索興就别要妻子了，省得多累了别人。</p>
<p>這想頭是否正確，那我就不能斷定了，因爲另外還有些人在主張着作妻的不一定要倚賴着丈夫維持生活。</p>
<p>我可不因此就承認窮苦的人，不該有妻子，反之，一個男人，就該有一個妻，同樣，一個女人也該有一個丈夫，窮，富，染病，那是另外一件事。</p>
<p>妻病了，我也病了，我們不知道要病到什麽時候，妻說過[爲什麽就病到我的身上呢？]我要更進一步地追問：</p>
<p>[爲什麽我們就不能看醫生呢？]</p>
<h3>松江半日記（續）</h3>
<p>— 華尙文</p>
<p>他買了一包香烟，取出一枝，送到山羊的口邊。他用鼻子聞聞，便吞到嘴裏，像草一般地，嚼下去了。有人將一支燃着的給他，他却避開不要。</p>
<p>C君又說：[所以奇怪，點着的香烟他是不吃的。]</p>
<p>但是，當C君自己拿一支點着的香烟和一枝沒有燃着的混在一起給他的時候，牠却毫不遲疑地一口咀嚼下去了。我們很擔心地還在旁邊等了一會兒，但他毫無痛苦的表示，大約他的口舌並未被燒傷罷。當時有個朋友笑着說，林語堂先生從前讚美過烟丐，假使看了這匹山羊，恐怕也要做一篇大文章來捧捧呢。出東嶽廟不遠，便是西林寺，我們的目的地到了。塔，就呌做西林塔，聳立在大殿前面。和尙看見一大隊游客進來，便拿着鑰匙出來，張着手要開門錢。講論了一番之後。塔下面的門是開了，却沒有人要上去。我想，上面也許可以望得見太湖，便自告奮勇地第一個先跑上去，有幾位接着跟了上來。樓梯很狹，不過還不十分高。登到最上一層，果眞看見遠處有幾片汪洋的水。我覺得有點不像太湖，作響導的S君告訴我：[那不是太湖，那是泖，就是書上所說的三泖]。我不禁感到一點輕微的失望。遠處還望得見有一座塔，據S君的說明，那是方塔，因爲塔是方形的，照這麽說，現在這座塔應該呌做八角塔了。我想方塔的名字，恐怕是俗稱罷。可惜天色已經不早，而方塔相去又遠，我們便沒有去。</p>
<p>在暮色蒼茫中，我們由原路走回。過了一座小橋，向右轉，到了滬松汽車大道。此時已經沒有汽車走過了，空敝的地面更顯得荒凉。據說四點鐘以後，便不開車，恐怕有危險。出汽車路，又走入巷道中。走了不遠，在一座平房的門前，S君停住了，說：</p>
<p>[裏面是華爾墓，大家要看看嗎？]</p>
<p>沒有回答，但是，大家都跟着走了進去。在院子中間，立着一支短短的洋式的墓碑，上面刻着一些横行的語句，初看像天書一般，便人讀不下去。後來看了背面刻的英文，才知道這是英文的直譯，并且，讀法也是由下而上的。翻譯這幾句英文的先生倒很不錯，假使他懂得一點哲學的術語，他也許會賣弄什麽[人生的象徵][象徵的人生]一類的玄虚呢。</p>
<p>這不過是餘談，當時使人發生感慨的乃是這位華爾將軍本身。提起華爾，像我們這年輩的人，大槪是誰都曉得的。當時小學校的國文和歷史敎科書上都記載着當勝軍的故事，而華爾，白齊文，戈登這三個名字也深深地印入了我們幼稚的腦裏。辛亥光復以後，革命的高潮掃蕩了我們腦子裏的陳腐思想。太平天國成了革命的前驅，赫赫一世的曾左李三個大偶像被斥爲國賊漢奸。華爾等這一類人自然也被冷落了，但，還沒有人認識他們的眞面目。有些人也許不有不承認曾李的創辦常勝軍，是借外國人的力量，給滿淸廜殺中國的農民，然而，另一部分人却反而說[長毛子]也有外國的背景。這都不外是此相之爭。現在，大家已經明白了。華爾等三人旣不是滿淸的功臣，也不是曾李的好友，實在是帝國主義第一次鎭壓中國革命的劊子手。滿淸這工具太沒有力量了！所以國際帝國主義帮他來組織常勝軍，奇妙的是華爾（美籍）白齊文（法籍）戈登（英藉）三個人的國籍完全不同，而練常勝軍屠殺巾國農民却是先後一致。這使人回想到袁世凱用了各國的顧問而結果是一致勸進。這决不是偶然的事。况且，華爾的墓碑是美國退伍軍人華爾團建立的。美國退伍軍人而有華爾團，這又使人連想到日本在鄉軍人的黑龍會。這樣想來想去，究竟不明白外國對於中國歷來的匪，爲什麽是這樣的關心。華爾這一塊紀念碑，因而便不能使我輕易忘懷了。</p>
<p>在暮色蒼茫中，上了回到上海的火軍，一路上，我總在想着這事。</p>
<h3>父女</h3>
<p>— 靳以</p>
<p>她近來淸楚地看出父親是又爲着什麽所苦惱，這使她覺得驚異。因爲一年來父親是這樣安好地生活着。雖然以前父親的心幾乎是每日在苦痛之中；可是一年前，她自己說過，她願意終身陪伴着父親，那時候不是看見他的眼睛包含着晶瑩的眼涙，她自己不是也就倒在父親的懷中痛哭起來了麽？她不是傷悼，她追想起自從懂得人事的時候起，就知道父親是如何寂寞地過着日子，撫養着她一天一天地長大來。雖然沒有明白地說出，她也知道父親的心中是多麽害怕她會愛上一個人，隨了這個人去，留下他一個人來度這悽冷的殘年；但是她告訴了父親，女兒有不離父親身邊的這心願。她記得從此以後他高興了，他顯得年輕；可是近些日子，她看到他又抑鬱起來了。</p>
<p>有些時候她從外面走進來。父親已經不知道到那裏去了，可是他那手杖仍放在墻角。把僕人呌來問詢，也只說他單身出去了，不知道在那裏。於是她就拿起那手杖，依了她自己的意思去尋找，很容易地在離家半里的公園裏看到他獨白站在那裏，像是　着什麽思念的樣子，他會緩緩地移動着步子，向深邃的林子走去，她立刻呌說：</p>
<p>[爸，您等等我好麽？]</p>
<p>他這時便顯出一點驚訝的神情，停住了脚，轉過身來，帶着一點高興，和一點厭烦的臉色朝她笑着。</p>
<p>[您的手杖忘記帶了，我給您送來了。]</p>
<p>她走到父親身傍，依在他的左面，却把那支手杖放在父親的右手裏。</p>
<p>父親望着她，眼睛裏閃着點光，好像在說：[你爲什麽來呢，您不能讓我一個人在這裏麽？]</p>
<p>她知道，她不敢去望父親臉，她只說時候晚了，引着父親向歸途走去。</p>
<p>[你還是像小孩子一樣他怕黑天麽？]</p>
<p>[可不是麽，爸，我離不開您，我一到天黑的時候，就怕您會捨了我。]</p>
<p>順着父親的話，她就故意裝成小孩子的樣子，她說着小孩子的話，把兩隻手纒着父親的左臂；可是她的心突然爲酸楚所佔領，眼睛裏幾乎滴下涙來。</p>
<p>[丨丨晚飯已預備好了，我給您燒了一隻雞，還把從杭州買來的蒓菜做了點湯，我又給您買了些燻魚]</p>
<p>她故意絮絮地說着。</p>

<p>申報無線電週刊</p>
<h3>編者言</h3>
<p>在民窮財盡的中國，要提倡無線電，使他有够普及於大衆，只有研究礦石機，因爲礦石機購置費廉，調節的手續又簡，且購置一具以後，卽無需再有支出。所以東方的日本爲節省人民經濟計，尙且盛倡全國礦石化，我們中國自己尙不能製造眞空管，自然更加需要提倡了。</p>
<p>礦石機雖然簡單，但可研究的地方尙多，例如礦石之發振，特殊的礦石機線路等，在在須要我們去檢討，我們希望全國研究無綫電者能注意到這經濟的礦石機，而加以研究，同時希望提倡無綫電者亦能够注意到全國人民的經濟能力，而促進全國的礦石化，這是我們發</p>
<h3>鑛石機之研究及其收音距離</h3>
<p>— 一知</p>
<p>講到普通礦石機，常苦不得美滿效果，其原因何在呢。欲使礦石機效率增進，能收音響亮，選擇靈敏，與收程遼遠，應注意下列四項，茲簡述於后。</p>
<p>（一）天線電路</p>
<p>礦石機所有電能，皆從天地線上振盪而來，振盪電流的强弱卽影響收音效率的高低，天線在適當限度内，其選擇性與靈敏度有一定的關係，天線短，則選擇力佳；天線高，則靈敏度强，往往一根短而高的天線，較長而低的爲優，所以天地線裝置合法，使收音效率加增，其裝置時應注意下列各點：㈠天線絕緣器須佳㈡天線用線不可太細㈢天線高　　　在二丈以上㈣天線及引入線不可邊長，入屋處又須用絕緣　　他物隔離㈤　線須埋在　　之　㈥天　線引入線　　　過長，　　　　　　　　固。</p>
<p>㈡譜</p>
<p>從天線上　　　　渡聚集在誘導　及電容裝上，變動　　　的大　，調查波長與外來的相同　　　　　　用而諧和　　　産生振　　　　　　召檢波器後，乃　聽筒　發　，　　　路佔礦石機之重要一部，所以應注意着配合，諧振　路内的誘　　　製時，　　徑不可太小，用線不可太細，如　　　觀而將圈數加增，繞在小　，　　　損失電　甚大，電容器選　　亦須　　　定片　　片的絕緣器須　膠不爲之；若選用紙板的，則遇潮天及霉雨時季，易失電能，使收音低减。</p>
<p>㈢礦石</p>
<p>礦石將高　率電流完成　音週率的檢波作用，其檢波的效率，在礦石上面常有不同，故用時須調整其接觸一最憑點，則收音響亮而遼遠，鑛石可在形式與實質上辨别其優劣，大槪其面多凹凸而發耀光，及收聽點多者爲佳品，面上平址而灰暗及收聽點少者爲劣品，鑛石常因使用過久，收音低微，其原因一爲灰塵侵入，一爲與空氣生氣化，防止的方法將鑛石製在玻璃罩内。又須注意。礦石不可用手接觸，若有灰塵，須用酒精揩凈或以小刀輕括。</p>
<p>㈣聽筒</p>
<p>聽筒的優劣，視其磁性及綫圈多少而定，在礦石機上所用者阻力最少有二千歐姆者，乃能感音靈敏，使用聽筒時必須注意條件：㈠勿敲擊及受劇烈振動，㈡薄腊上的水氣須時時揩乾。</p>
<p>末後，欲談到礦石機的收音能力了，普通礦石機，在距離電力一百瓦特的電台約五六十里之遥，可以收聽，若能研究改進，使用得法，可遠達一二百里之遥。至於接收長波電報，則可遠至一二千里，今中央電台落成後，距離其四五百里範圍之内，如揚州，鎭江，常州，無錫，靑浦，蕪湖等地，據該地收音報告，謂用礦石機收聽中央，甚爲淸晰。又據說杭州曾有人用礦石機收到過中央，其收音的距離頗可驚了，所以礦石機，能使用得法，論其成績，亦可較綫路不佳的單管眞空管機爲優，所以望國人勿嫌其陳舊而棄之我們大家起來，共同研究改進吧！（完）</p>
<h3>礦石檢波器的動作原理</h3>
<p>— 蔡光華</p>
<p>在沒有講礦石檢波器的動作原理以前，我們應當先明白一種奇特的現像。我們知道，二塊不同礦石或一塊礦石和一只金屬針碰在一起的時候，有一種反抗能力發生，這種反抗能力，足以使礦石間或礦石和金屬針間流過的電流，祇向一面流去，這就是普通所講礦石檢波器的單傳性（UnilateratCondcuctivity），這樣的接觸，有整流的功能，因此，同時也就所謂接觸整流器（Contat·Rectifer）</p>
<p>假使我們把一種交流電壓和一只接觸整流器聯接在一起（見圖一，AB兩礦石接觸），我們把第二圖Y曲綫來代表原有電波，那麽，整流後的電波，就可用第二圖Y綫來代表，從這二根曲綫的最高和最低點（Maxima　and　Minime）方面，我們可以得到一個結論，就是說，雖然原有電波的正負半波的幅都相等（A1等於A2·圖二X），可是整流的結果，却是A1大於A2Y（圖二），正半波大於負半波（整流必不凈）原因是電子從B流到A</p>
<p>，較從A流到B，還要容易，（圖一），換句話說。二塊不同礦石或一塊礦石和一只金屬針接觸在一起，就有整流作用發生，礦石檢波器就是司理這種作用的先驅者。</p>
<p>在檢波綫路裏，天綫吸收外來電波以後，天綫裏發生了射電周率電流，綫圈的二端，發生了高周率電壓，電流經過礦石的時候，根據了上述接觸整流器的作用，祇有半波的電流流過聽筒，然後，由電流的强弱，將聽筒振動板起各種不同的動作而成音波。</p>
<p>因爲礦石檢波器祇能接收减幅波（DampedWave）電訊或無綫電話，不能接收等幅波（ContinousWsve）電訊，所以礦石收音機不能收聽電報，那是礦石檢波器的最大缺憾</p>
<h3>特殊鑛石收音機的綫路</h3>
<p>— 李元慶</p>
<p>丨介紹兩個全波鑛石收音機丨</p>
<p>我們知道：鑛石所以能够檢波，因爲牠是一個單向的導體。因此，普通鑛石機接到的音訊，祇是外來電波一半的能力，其餘一半的電能，便祇好棄掉。現在利用二個鑛石，置在相反的方面，那麽，外來電波的能力，便能給完全抓住。收音機得到的電能，旣已增加一倍，輸出的音量，當然也隨之加響了。</p>
<p>第一法先將常用的聽筒，改爲二節，每節各具二個接頭，彼此各不相連，（見第三圖）依照第一圖綫路接好後，便能得到雙重電能的音訊。</p>
<p>第二圖：聽筒不加改造。先將音訊輸入兩個低週率變壓器的初級綫圈内，聽筒則連接在二個次級綫圈上，也能得到同樣的結果。</p>
<p>本文爲卽省篇幅計，叙述力求簡單，至於詳細的理論，容再叙述。</p>

<h3>兒童年與家庭敎育</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>中國兒音，素來不大爲人們所重視；迨至現在，好幸運才被社會抬出來舉行了一個[兒童年]。[兒童節]在現代文明各國，差不多早就規定了。歐美以至日本諸强盛國家，對於兒童事業，莫不深切注意。如兒童公園，兒童圖書館，託兒所，兒童敎養院，頑童感化院等的創設，已成習見。獨我落後的中國，不但兒童事業，未見有人舉辦；卽兒童的地位，也不曾給人認識淸楚。豈知兒童乃社會國家民族的命脈；其關係於社會之文野，國家之存亡，民族之興衰，至重且大。故我人若要改造社會；改造國家，改造民族，自應先從兒童入手。此今歲[兒童年]所以舉行之意義也。</p>
<p>[兒童年]對於兒童的期望，槪括言之，不外是要使中國每個兒童將來能成爲一個身心健全的國民，以便爲社會國家民族的前途謀福利。關於個人身心的强弱，一半由於先天的遺傳，一半在乎後天的培養。現把先天的遺傳撇開不說；至後天培養的工具，當然是敎育了；而敎育有家庭敎育和學校敎育之分，前者比後者又爲重要，故單就這一方面來談一談。</p>
<p>我國兒童，在家庭中所處的地位，旣甚低微；又每被爲父母者視若私産。通常家庭中的父母，不是把兒童看做是一種[慰藉品]，就是將兒童當爲是一個[防老的工具]，或[承接祖先香烟的傳代者]，他們幾科沒有意識到兒童們的身上，是負有一個重大的使命，是未來社會的中堅份子，國家的梀樑，民族的前驅。因此家庭中的父母，對於子女所抱的觀念，旣屬錯誤：從而於其兒童的家庭敎育，也就不加注意了。一般富裕家庭的父母，他們對待子女，全取放任態度；只知一味溺愛，與以享樂上充分的滿足，而忘却了敎育方面應盡的義務。由是養成了許多沒有能力，缺乏知識，驕奢惰逸的兒童，爲將來的社會國家遺下無窮的禍害。至大多數貧苦的家庭，則爲父母，每受生活驅迫作牛馬，爲衣食奔走之不暇，那里還有工夫去敎育子女？並且有的因爲自身從未受過敎育的訓練，更不識家庭敎育爲何物。而他們的子女，因生活在啼飢號寒中，豈僅精神上得不到有益的董陶；卽物質的營養上，也常感到缺乏，致影響到身體的發育。這類家庭，結果也不過替社會國家製造了一大批不健全的份子，於人羣也是不利的。這便是今日我國這腐惡的現社會之所以形成的主因。故欲救現在中國社會之弊，首先在提高兒童的地位；而要提高兒童的地位，自必以實施家庭敎育爲起點。否則社會人士儘管[兒童年]！[兒童是國家未來的主人翁]！喊得震天假響，亦是徒托空言而已，無補實際。</p>
<p>關於實行家庭敎育應注意之點，重要者約有幾端：㈠養成兒童的良好習慣；㈡改善兒童的惡劣環境；㈢留心兒童的飤食起居衛生等；㈣鍜鍊兒童的强健體魄；㈤淘冶兒童的優美性格；㈥灌輸兒童的愛國信念；㈦助長兒童的求知欲望；㈧引導兒童的自治能力；㈨培植兒童的堅决意志，㈩訓育兒童的勞動精神；㈩㈠促進兒童的合羣思想；㈩㈡傾注兒童社會意識，㈩㈢指示兒童的正確行爲，等等。至實施的方法，可依家庭的狀况，社會的需求，兒童的興趣，擇一最適當的步驟，循循然敎之育之誘之導之。一面又使其入學校多受知識，倍加修養，俾兒童能成爲一個身心健全的國民，爲將來的社會國家民族造福，則人羣受賜不淺矣！願我國家庭之爲父母者，千勿放棄這敎導兒童的重大職責，是所厚望！</p>
<h3>回光返照</h3>
<p>— 宓耳</p>
<p>在這新歲伊始的當兒，談論[死]的事情，是很不吉利的。這是俗例如此的規定。其實這種俗例規定完全是心理作用，和事實怎樣會附合？譬如，照舊例，我們在新年碰見時，須說聲[恭禧發財！]這句老套的賀語，自然是旣吉　　　有　　　　　　　　　的　　詞，至今已有幾十次了，而他總不能因了牠就發財！况且[死]是無論何人所免不了的呢。談談又何妨？</p>
<p>但是，這個[死]字壓根兒是個可怕的字。十八世紀英國大文豪約翰遜博士，博學多才，殆爲當代文藝界的檯柱，他有絕大的勇氣與惡劣環境奮鬭，而他一聽到[死]，就會不由自主地全身震撼　秆　悚然！[死]的可怕，是不言而喻的。然而我們無論怎樣最後總避不了[死]的邀請！</p>
<p>基督敎告訴我們說：我們活在世上，正和旅客一樣。牠的意思是我們將來總得[歸老家。]的確，我們從來沒有聽見一個不死的人。然而我們又都活着，當然不知死的苦况。不過我們以爲除了少數例外，大多數人臨終的時候，總不免懊悔生前的罪惡。報紙上常載着匪徒正刑之前，往往勸觀衆不要學他的樣，總須好端端的做人。這不是表示他的懺悔是什麽？照常情而論，人死前大槪總是臥病。這個臥病的時期，恐怕就是人們臨終懺悔或作快樂之回憶的一刻吧？有的人一生急公好義或樂善好施，臨終時回想到一生中種種善行，而感到無窮的快慰。像這種人能利用天賦的精力負人類應負的責任，因了這樣所有的快慰是人生無上的快慰。但是有的像竊國求　的鄭孝胥這樣的人，或是陷民於水火的政客，官僚，惡棍等，除非是死於急病，在臨終時所要說的恐怕就是懺悔語吧？可是那時的懺悔於事實何補？有的軍　和政　在　　幾生　說經拜　的懺悔昔日的軍罪。不過他們的懺悔多在失意下野之後，而不在執政掌權大有作爲的當兒，所以他們的懺悔和我們小百姓沒有關係。換句話說，他們作惡後的懺悔，不能减輕我們被陷入水火中的痛苦總之，死是人人免不了的。如果要在短短人生過程中得到無上的快慰，一個人至少在他職位上達到在可能範圍内最完美的成績。一個學生平時不能理頭用功，臨考時抄襲無弊，一個商人經營違禁的物品，一個誤人子弟的敎員，一個不能保國衛疆的軍人，一個不能造福國家的政客……這種人的生活無論怎樣的舒適，在臨終的一霎那他們的良心會像萬箭射上般的懊痛！</p>
<p>這是完全出於我們的理想嗎？不，將被正刑的罪人底懺語是我們最好的例證！</p>

<p>我們的弄呇裏在每弄的第一家都設備着一只垃圾箱。在垃圾箱的旁邊，除了垃圾以外，我們時常會發見的就是被棄的小孩子了。今天又發見了一個。媽告訴我說[今天在垃圾箱旁邊有一個包着黄布的小孩子，大槪還祗生後八九天的模樣，一雙烏黑有光的小眼，活潑地張望着煞是可愛動人，在包布裏面有小孩子的生日時辰和十塊錢，這是給收留這小孩的人的。這一定是誰家的姑娘，孕了私生子而産後無法這棄的。]接着媽又說了：[這個小孩子是男的呀！况又是很可愛的，我很想抱他進來，給你嫂嫂做兒子，你看，你的嫂嫂到我家來已經十年了，我和你的哥哥不必去說，就是我們的親戚朋友，也是多麽熱烈地盼望着，他們也都等得焦心，而漸漸覺得失望了。不知怎的你的嫂嫂許愿唸佛，磕頭禮拜，吃什麽仙方神藥，總是不見有什麽效力，也並沒有生個一男，育個半女，爲了這就使家庭失睦，經濟外溢。你哥哥在外納妾，你嫂嫂在家生病吃藥　今天這個孩子倒是很好的，又是男孩子，可是我家又不准一　子　入家譜，承繼上代，所以羹飯仍舊無處着落，最後[領子]逝世又不許上堂，所以千思萬想仍舊想不出一個所以然的道理來媽說了這話後，因着些事就走開了，祇留我一個在房中了。呵！我想，社會上的事情何其矛盾呀！在我的腦海中幻想起那被棄孩子的母親的情景來了，她丨丨那孩子的母親，現在她的心上所受的愴痛是何等的沉重呀！任何人愛她自己的親生子女，她當然是不能例外，她把十塊錢裏在小孩子身邊把孩子的生日時辰也放着，她把將棄的孩子弄妥當了，預備去丢掉的時候，她的心該是碎裂到如何程度了啊！她一定是在受人家的蜚言議論，累家庭的冷嘲熱駡，……這是爲的是她不應該生而生了這個孩子；我的嫂嫂她極希望有一個孩子，可是沒有，因此哥哥變了心，抱孫心切的媽也感到很不高興，嫂嫂自己無論怎樣不能爲此而努力，家庭竟失睦了，……這也是爲了求她生而沒有生孩子。這難道還不矛盾得滑稽可笑嗎？有了孩子不過沒有孩子的父親（所謂正式的父親），社會沒人的襲擊，沒有孩子也得受着同等類似的痛苦，這不是放屁之至嗎？……</p>

<h3>[精神文明]和[同化力]</h3>
<p>— 何覺夫</p>
<p>與幾個出生在異國的同胞，同在一塊兒混了幾個月。默察着他們温和的性情，文雅的舉止，又使我聯想到旁的一件事情上來了。</p>
<p>記得小學讀書的時候，在我的數十個小伴侶中間，是有好幾個出生在海外，未曾受過[禮義之邦]的祖國敎育薰陶過的孩子，他們的皮膚毛髮，說話動作，和我們是沒有什麽不同的；但，他們的性情，脾氣，和處事態度，可就特别的多了。</p>
<p>因爲我們是孩子，做事不大認眞和講理，這是事實，但，一遇於已不利的事，不顧一切，立卽動起武來，這也是我們所不幹的。在我們的眼裏，大槪凡是認爲足以招致危險，或增加煩難的事。卽使明知自己是受屈，也多是隱忍退縮下去。但是，這幾個出生在異國的孩子，可就不盡與我們苟同了。無論你是在幹個什麽，或說了什麽，只要是干犯着他們的，不問對方的力氣多少大，他們終要給你一頓痛快的報復，才能安心靜氣下去。在這中間，他們雖也曾遭受過不少次難堪的回擊，但，他們這剛硬的氣質，暴躁的性情，總是不有輕易改變過來的。</p>
<p>當時，我的所紀很輕，論力量，當然抵不過他們，但，與他們是同學，爭爭閙閙的事，是免不掉的；所以，在小學唸幾年書，吃他們的虧，可就不知多少次了。尙記得，我每次受了屈，總是負着痛，垂着涙，奔到我母親的面前訴苦，她聽完我的話後，常是擺着一副憤怒的面孔，半在慰籍我，半在辱駡他們說：</p>
<p>[他們是雜種，他們是番子！你以後别和這一班不懂禮的東西，同在一塊兒玩好了！]</p>
<p>[番子]，這是一個何等惡毒的名詞呀！我因纍次吃他們的氣，所以，[番子]這刻毒的名詞，就像惡魔的猙獰面孔一樣，牢牢地在我的腦子裏據着了。進入中學後，[番子]所給予我的惡印象，還沒有絲毫淡漠下去，並且，同學間，也着實有不少個[番子]在；不過，像小學時的那些全不講情的，是沒有幾個了。所以，在中學混過幾年，我倒也勉强合上幾個稍略稱心的[番子]朋友。</p>
<p>現在，我在大學裏又混過許多時了，在這裏，假使不是因時間過得久，和從與同學們諧談間，探出一些消息來，而要由人的脾氣和性情上辨認出那幾個是暴躁强悍的[番子]來，是萬辦不到的；就除我所熟識的這幾個不說，其餘的，他們的氣質何嘗不是同我們正道地出生的一樣寛和，温柔，敦厚，……呢？默想着這些事情，我深悟到同胞們常引爲自豪的所謂[精神文明]和[同化力]的偉大來了。</p>
<h3>[社會卽學校]</h3>
<p>— 了之</p>
<p>[社會卽學校]這口號在歐美早已宣傳一時，且見諸實現，而於我國則尙未有什麽大響應。本來，人是社會的動物，不能離社會而生存，而學校又是社會中的一種集團，亦不得獨立於社會之圈外。且事實告訴我們，人的生活，已一天進展一天了，單憑靠着狹隘的學校敎育，要去應付繁複的生活環境，簡直成爲不可能。於是有心的敎育家看到這一缺陷，知道簡單的學校敎育，已不足滿足社會的需求，便把學校的範圍擴大起來，主張，[社會卽學校，]以順應這新時代的潮流。他們的原意，是想將學校的垣墻折下來，呌學生把眼光放遠大些，親到社會去禮騐各方面的實際生活，以便他日離開學校，加入社會團體去活動。這從實際上和學理上看，應認爲是一種極切合時代的新敎育學，值得我們鼓勵的。</p>
<p>我國的敎育，已瀕於破産了，這並非言過其實。我國今日的敎育，雖全國各大中小學每年也曾加工趕製地出産了一批批的畢業生，這在量的方面，不能不說是大有可觀，可是按之實際，這些可謂功業完滿了的學生，一離開學校，跑進社會中去，則不但學非所用，卽連極簡單的社會環境，也有無法應付之勢，這是什麽原因呢？這便是因爲我國敎育，自來把學校和社會隔離得太遠之故。他們學校自學校，社會自社會，學校和社會，幾成爲風馬牛之不相關。因此，學生遠離了社會生活，緊閉在學校中辛勤幾年，結局所得到的知識和技能，一搬進社會中去應用，便要到處碰壁！現在我國社會上各種人材之所以如是缺少，一班畢業生之所以一無出路，也無非是這原因所造成，這就是今日中國敎育所示於我們的成績！</p>
<p>故爲我國敎育前途計，目前的急務，首先應解除學校和社會中間這一層隔膜，將學校和社會打成一片，學校和社會，須息息相關，學校時時留心到社會的變遷情形，社會又應多方給與學校以帮助，俾學生親入社會中去經歷，在社會生活中去獲取各種實際的知識。能如是，才可以聊救今日中國敎育之一弊。</p>

<h3>呈閱本刊的中學生讀者們做參考建設</h3>
<p>現實的中學生們，我們覺得不大滿意，因爲他們的生活還有多少缺陷：如男性中學生方面的惰性，浪漫，苦悶，思想混沌，行爲乖謬等；女性中學生方面的奢侈，不用功，專講修飾等，這些都需要我們來檢討與補救。尤其是剛剛踏上中學階級的小朋友們，應該特别的嚴格自律，現在我就把中學們應予注意的幾點，寫在後面。</p>
<p>撾住環境與認淸求學的目的環境能支配人類，這在機械唯物論者已昭示了我們；同時人類亦能改造環境，這是辨證法唯物論的新獲得。物觀的環境能注定我們的生活，我們更應從此而加創造的種子，使能在舊的環境中産生出新的環境來，中學生應該注意這一點。此外求學的目的是什麽，我可乾脆的答復：[學以致用]，要將我們的智識移到實際的生活上去，那才不失學的使命。所謂[學而優則仕]，那眞正豈有此理。</p>
<p>生活紀律化浪漫的生活是最有害於肉體與精神，應該工作的時候，偏去遊戲，當要遊戲的時候却在工作，這是一般的通病。應該改變過來，絕對的過紀律的生活，卽是讀書的時候，努力讀書，遊戲的時候努力遊戲，這樣，不但有益於身體的健康，且於讀書的效率亦定有神速的進展。</p>
<p>鍊成强壯的體魄[天才]二字的新</p>
<p>解釋是[不斷的努力]，所謂努力，勢不能不有强壯的體魄爲之基礎。[健全的腦力，寓於健全的身體，]這是多麽警闢的名句，蔡孑民氏嘗昭示我們應[鍊成獅子一樣的體魄]。我們要想研究高深的學問，就需要不斷的努力，欲能不斷的努力，就需有一個强壯的體魄。怎樣鍊法呢？就是多致力於運動。</p>
<p>切忌與異性發生接觸中學生的年齡，大都是十二到十八，正是生理發育心理轉變最劇烈的時期，理智尙未充實，情感却很熱烈，春情勃勃，對於異性，不免有盲目的要求。因此若與異性偶爾發生接觸，便不免要不顧一切的去愛戀，追逐，結果則不免大糟特糟，使你會根本忘記讀書，天天只知厮守着戀人了。</p>
<p>有恒與虚心[欲速則不達]，學問到底是難於速成的。那麽，應該怎樣？據我看學問的成功，胥從[累積]中得來，而累積的基礎，就是有恒，若果你今朝高興，便發奮忘食的拚命拿着書本唸。一旦興趣完了，便將它束之高閣，旬日不顧，這樣[一暴十寒]，無論怎樣是沒有成效的。其次虚心亦很重要，有些靑年，偶有所得，卽詡詡自雄，那眞是學業的致命傷。我們可不要忘記了[滿招損，謙受益]的明訓才是。</p>
<p>課外多自修老實說，學校敎育。你若想在課堂裏得到充裕的智識，那是不可有的事。課堂裏只能得到一些學問的門徑和工具，換言之，敎員只能指示我們一個方向，遥遥的路程，還須我們自家去走。記得陳定謨先生在研究學問的方法一文中曾說：[我們在學校裏所學的只是學問的梗槪和求智識的方法吧了]，此語殊不錯。要想充實學問，還須自已努力。並且中學生更應注重一二種比較專的學科，使畢業後，而不能升學，自己也有一藝之長，作爲謀生的工具，這，在目前的混亂社會裏，尤其需要，因爲客觀的事實已這樣的昭示着我們。</p>

<h3>職工的膳宿問題</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我是他鄉人，由親戚介紹，來上海某洋行賬房辦事，每月薪水二十二元，但不供膳宿。（午飯是有的，不過星期日却停開）</p>
<p>初來上海時，由原介紹人代我設法膳宿，他介紹我到他親戚家暫時寄宿，由我每月付他膳宿費七元。我睡處是客堂，早拆夜搭，客堂是進出要道，並且他們還要深夜打牌，因此使我常常不能安睡。我祗得另設别法，分頭向親戚家朋友處磋商。但是有家眷的親戚家，房子都不大寛餘，朋友又都是些吃人家飯的小夥計，不能作主讓我久住（一二個月是可以的）而吃飯包一客太不合算，就是忍痛包一客，飯作亦不肯送。因此住食都是大問題，尤以住爲最難解决。因爲借住旁人處旣辦不到，於是我祗得自己租房子，但上海房子[非眷莫問]者居多，單身人很難租到，因此我祗得將家眷搬來，住在房租便宜地帶。（城内亭子間八元）然我每月心入祗有廿二元，怎能開銷衣，食，住，應酬等等費用。如使女眷出外工作，又有小人二個，不能離開一步。所以我爲了職業反要年年負債。</p>
<p>編者先生，像我這樣情形，不帶家眷就無膳宿之處，帶了家眷又不够開支，反要負債，豈非有了職業反更增痛苦！但如若將職業辭去家中怎能坐吃，又加名譽有關；若另找别業，更談何容易！所以我爲了日食夜宿問題，自來申後，日日煩悶，毫無解决辦法，今見報上有</p>
<p>先生能代解難决問題，故特將細情函告，務請早日指導解答至所盼禱此請</p>
<p>編安　余瑞生鞠躬</p>
<p>編者按：這是一個極易解决的問題，同時也是一個毫無解决辦法的問題。因爲假如你收入很豐，那衣，食，住，樣樣都可稱心滿意，又怎會發生這樣問題。所以問題的中心不在於衣食住之無法解决，而是經濟之困難。收入之支絀。照你每月收入的數目講，勉强維持個人生活，就已是很困難的一件事，若再贍養家庭其困苦自更不待言。因此，你的所謂[膳宿問題]，亦卽是整個生活問題。個人對於這問題的最好解决辦法是增加收入，但社會主失業　數之多，善找報酬較高的職業，眞是[談何容易]，因此，這問題要靠個人的努力是不能解决的。</p>
<p>然則眞個束手待斃，靜待餓死嗎？不！不！决不！我們决不能爲知活之因難，環境之惡劣而屈服，我們却要爲創造新環境，創造新生活而奮鬥，而作殊死戰！</p>
<p>我們如何創造新環境，新生活呢？關於這，我們却可解答：卽是你所遭受的困苦的境遇，並非是你一個人的單獨問題，是靠薪水過活的人所共同感受到的痛苦。這種痛苦决非個人單獨的努力所可消滅，而需要共同感受到這種痛苦的人，聯合起來，大家去研究這種痛苦的由來，想出解除這種痛苦的辦法，同時更恊力去實行解决這種困難，惟有如此，你的困難纔得解决；否則，我們也像你一樣，對於這問題是一無辦法。</p>
<p>我們對於這封信，所答覆的祗是一個槪括解决方向，至於具體辦法，尙希讀者提出來公開討論。我們所以要把這封信公表的目的，就是這問題在現在社會中雖是無法解决，但却爲一般人的最嚴重的問題，因此我們希望關心社會問題或社會前途的人對此問題予以深切的注意；同時我們更希望切身感受這種困難的人，對此問題加以愼重的考慮而想出解决的辦法。</p>

<h3>曼惡的自由（二）</h3>
<p>— 曼之</p>
<p>第二天的下午我我到你們家裏，你這一回大槪以爲是我是時常來的熟客了並不呌我到客堂去坐冷板凳，迎我進你們的房間：我心裏雖然記着那一次的事，但也就不覺得什麽地進了房間坐下。我喜歡下五子棋，我招呼你到圓桌子前面來下棋，你答應了，可是你那淸瘦的臉龎上面就如秋天的淸澄的碧空一樣地却浮上了一陣灰黯的雲翳，我心裏雖然忖度到你一定有什麽不高興的心事，可是我怎麽可以明白地問你？我雖然在下棋，因此也就並不快樂；而你也無心地爭鬥，終於下不成盤而嘆着氣了！</p>
<p>你開始一句話就說，[你昨天和人傑去看戲喝酒，他又上回力球塲將錢輸光才回來，你是他的老朋友，也應該勸勸他才對！]</p>
<p>這是怨恨我這爲你丈夫的老朋友的話了！我駭然！當時你應該看得出我的眼睛是表現着詫異的瞠睜了吧？</p>
<p>我說，[昨天去看[大飯店]，然後到[潔而精]吃飯，他上回力球塲說是去消遣，我也曾勸過他不應該這樣的頽廢。]</p>
<p>你說，[他近來眞是頽廢，和我同居以來，沒有一天不吵架，他大槪是因爲和我同居才頽廢的了，丨我眞不願害他，任他頽廢下去！]</p>
<p>[他也太對不住我，]你說着便流了眼涙而且聲帶也嗚咽起來，[從前他和陸碧霞一起的時候，你大槪是知道的吧？他待陸碧霞多麽好，她說什麽就什麽，她的話就如上帝的命令一樣；他待我呢，任你怎樣的勸他說他，我的話就當耳邊風丨他這一年來，拿到稿費或是學校的薪水，都送給回力球塲，每一次勸他不要那樣的將金錢向海裏丢，他呢，聽都不聽，就好像吃醉了酒的人一樣，一點理性都沒有。他又喜歡喝酒，一喝就起碼三瓶四瓶，任你勸也是勸不回來。他一喝了酒常常反常地冷笑大笑，我問他心裏有什麽煩悶苦惱的事，他一點都不說，他就如一個瘋狂的人一樣。他明明是心裏煩悶苦惱，可是他不告訴我，我怎麽曉得他究竟爲的什麽事而煩悶苦惱的呢。這樣，我就安慰他，也不曉得那一種話是眞正能够安慰他的心的話了。我是在過着憂愁不安的生活，我爲他在憂愁着不安着，可是我又不能够在他跟前表現着我的憂愁與不安，我怎麽生活下去呢？</p>
<p>[精神上的痛苦是這樣，物質上亦並沒有顧到，你看房間裏一團精，沙發的套子也不給錢買，我身上的衣服就都是舊的，還有房錢亦差兩個月沒給。他天天說有辦法，那裏來的辦法呢？從前他和陸碧霞在一起，聽朋友說，陸碧霞今天做一套西裝，明天做兩件旗袍，這且不去說它，他連自己都不管，要人管。他實在太對不住我了！</p>
<p>[而且，時常吵鬧，拿我來發脾氣，我是給人發脾氣的一件東西嗎？…我再也受不住了！]</p>
<p>你盛氣地凄楚地說着，我當時什麽話都難開口。對於你的苦楚我表同情，可是對於人傑的任性我也能够原諒；而且夫婦間的事第三者能够說什麽話呢？說你的不對呢？你一定不高興。說他的不對吧？將來丨就說明天吧，你們愛好的時候，你也一定駡我。所以當時我就對於你的苦楚表同情，我也並不說人傑的壞話，你記得吧？我當時只嘆了一聲說，</p>
<p>[人傑近來刺激太深，走向頽廢的路上去了！]</p>

<h3>Guangdong Case Will Be the Focus of Discussion</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain Central Committee member said that there are not many proposals from various parties regarding military, political, and diplomatic issues at this Fourth Plenary Session.

After Chairman Chiang arrives in Beijing, an informal meeting will be held first, and then the agenda will be discussed. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a certain committee member, the Guangdong Committee will come to Beijing within a few days. The Guangdong proposal was previously brought to Beijing by Sun Ke, but Sun only brought a letter of opinion without a formal proposal. The content focuses on rectifying Party discipline and revitalizing politics, and advocates that the military listen to the government and the government listen to the Party. The original text of this letter of opinion was revised by Chuan Bingchang and recorded by Wu Ti-yun, and is Wu's last work, a valuable historical document for the Party.

The current situation in Shaanxi is peaceful, and all parties can proceed in an orderly manner, but the conflict between Sun and Ma is quite worrying. He and Yang Hucheng jointly telegraphed Sun Dianying on the morning of the 19th, advising him to stop his westward advance and wait for the Central Government to resolve it. Deng Baoshan arrived in Shaanxi yesterday and discussed with Yang Hucheng plans to maintain peace and security in the Northwest, and entrusted Yu to report to the Central Government.

(19th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>Cheng Qian and Others Propose a National Salvation Plan</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) It is widely rumored that Central Committee members Cheng Qian and others in Shanghai will submit a national salvation plan to the Fourth Plenary Session for discussion. It is heard that the main points are roughly to expand the powers of the Standing Committee of the Central Political Council to achieve the effect of centralized rule. As for the original members of the Standing Committee, Wang Zhaoming, Chiang Kai-shek, and Hu Hanmin, the three members have built a lot for the Party and the country and are highly respected at home and abroad, so it is still advocated that they be re-elected. The issue of the division of powers between the central government and the provinces is also planned to be raised for discussion, appropriately dividing the powers to adjust the chaos of the past. It is said that this case has been endorsed by most of the Shanghai committee members such as Zhang Renjie and Li Yuwin. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Zhiben said that he has no special opinions on the conference. He only co-signed with Committee Member Cheng Qian in Shanghai on a national defense proposal, which has been directly sent to the Central Secretariat from Shanghai. Committee Member Li Liejun will propose two cases to the conference: opening up political power and reforming politics. Li is afraid that he will not be able to come to Beijing to attend the meeting due to illness. Sun Jingya said that the Shanghai Committee, led by Cheng Qian, jointly submitted a proposal to the plenary session to consolidate national defense and formally organize a National Defense Committee. He has already signed the proposal. (19th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>A Word for the Fourth Plenary Session [By] Ting</h3>
<p>The Northeast Incident. A rare and huge change in the modern history of the world. Such a blow. Not enough to awaken the government and the public of our country. Then the future of the entire Chinese nation. Will be hopeless. It's not just the loss of the country. At the time of the Fourth Plenary Session to discuss the great plan of [Consolidating the National Foundation and Revitalizing the Nation]. We dare to do our duty to the media. Briefly contribute our humble opinions.</p>
<p>(1) Before the Sino-Japanese War. The Japanese people deliberately planned to plot against Korea. Korea then perished. After that, they accumulated little by little to plot against Manchuria. The puppet organization became a reality. Now they want more. It will also involve North China. We should pay attention to observing the subtle details of the Japanese people's actions. Often seeing its intentions. For example, before the 918 Incident, the Japanese people wrote books. The discussion often mentions [Korea] and [Manchuria]. Now it is often referred to as [Korea], [Manchuria] and [North China]. For example, the cover illustrations of its national pictorials used to be mostly Manchurian monuments. Now it is replaced by famous places in North China. [When you step on frost, you know that thick ice is coming.] The origin is clear. I am afraid that North China's view of Manchuria. It will be like Manchuria's view of Korea. In recent days, it has been frequently reported that Puyi will soon claim the throne. Those who know say that the inside story of this matter. It's not the change of the [Manchukuo] Executive to the imperial system. But it is the plan of the [Qing Dynasty] to restore the abdicated emperor. The Japanese are taking the initiative from it. This is even more obvious to those with eyes. Like this conspiracy and ambition. Emerging endlessly. Future hidden worries. I don't know where it will end. Moreover, the international situation in the Far East. It is also becoming increasingly tense. Today, it is widely rumored that the crisis of 1936 is inevitable. Whether it is a Japanese-American war or a Japanese-Russian war. Our country cannot stand idly by. Just in terms of the current situation in our country today. May I ask how we can safely overcome this future difficulty.</p>
<p>(2) Rural bankruptcy. Industrial and commercial decline. People's livelihood is unstable. Banditry is frequent. All are serious problems today. Urgent need to solve. However, using military force to eliminate the superficial evil forces. It is only a palliative treatment. If you want to cure the root cause. The first is the improvement of politics. If the government is clean and bright. Then the people will live and work in peace and contentment. So as not to be forced into danger. Agriculture, industry and commerce. It can also be brought into line. Slowly develop. Last year, the customs import surplus reached a huge amount of 900 million yuan. Sufficient to be the gaze of the failure to reconcile production and consumption. The future of the national economy. How can we imagine. Those who plan for the country. Should know to prescribe the right medicine. Strive for the big ones.</p>
<p>(3) In today's national political system. Whether it is [Democracy] or dictatorship. Its governance is not outside the realm of a political group. If you want this group to exert its effectiveness. The three essential elements of doctrine, organization and cadre talent are indispensable. Today's main task of the Kuomintang. In strengthening its organization. Unite its cadre talent. Forming a whole powerful group. Only then can we implement its doctrine. Bear the responsibilities that should be fulfilled internally and externally. In addition, we should also recruit talents from outside the party. Collect public opinion widely. To overcome national difficulties together.</p>
<p>In short, the current national lifeline is full of holes and sores. All need to be remedied. It is really coming to the last moment. At the beginning of the opening of this Fourth Plenary Session. How should we discuss and cope with this [Extraordinary Time]'s actual approach. The people of the country are eagerly looking forward to it. Government leaders, make your last effort.</p>

<p>Inner Mongolia Petition Representatives</p>
<h3>Drafting a Petition</h3>
<p>Stating the Reasons for Not Accepting the Autonomous Measures</p>
<p>Still Requesting Promulgation According to the Principles Established at Bailingmiao</p>
<p>(Nanjing) During the banquet for Mongolian autonomous representatives on the evening of the 18th, hosted by Wang, the representatives expressed on the spot their inability to accept the Inner Mongolian autonomous measures passed by the Political Council. Wang replied by asking the representatives to submit their statements in writing. On the morning of the 19th, the representatives gathered at the representative offices in Beijing of various Mongolian leagues and banners to discuss and decide to draft a petition. The petition would state the process of the Mongolian autonomous plan discussed by Huang Shaoxiong and the Mongolian princes and representatives at Bailingmiao, and the reasons why the Mongolian leagues and banners could not accept the enacted law passed by the central government this time. It is planned to submit it to the central government within the next few days. According to representative Zhao Taibao, when Wang hosted the banquet for the representatives on the 18th, President Dai and Chairman Shi, etc., were all present. In addition to Wang's expression of opinions, Dai and Shi also expressed opinions. The representatives then explained their mission, which was to request the central government to adopt the eleven opinions they had presented. Now that the central government is not accommodating, the representatives can only return to Mongolia with tears. Finally, Wang and Dai reiterated their opinions, stating that the central government has not made much change to the points raised by the representatives, except for changing the two districts into four districts. The established counties are still under the jurisdiction of the provincial government. The organizational scope has not been reduced. If the representatives have any opinions, they can submit them for review. The representatives have now drafted an opinion letter, still requesting the central government to pass the original plan and submit it to the central government for adoption. The representatives also visited Minister Huang on the morning of the 20th to explain their difficulties and asked Huang to report to the central government to promulgate according to the principles established at Bailingmiao to preserve the central government's prestige.

<h3>Ma Telegraphed That Sun's Troops Were Pressing In</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Ma Hongkui telegraphed to Ping this morning, saying that the majority of Sun Dianying's army had engaged in battle with my cavalry Ma Kui regiment at Shizuishan. Because we defended with natural barriers, Sun's army suffered heavy losses and is still in a stalemate. Its main force has been crossing the river from Wuyuan, Linhe, Dengkou, etc., since the 16th, intending to concentrate in Woye and attack the Hedong line, with the intention of breaking through Hengcheng and heading straight for the provincial capital. The advance party, led by the bandit Yang Monkey Kid, with more than 1,000 men, came into contact with the Second Cavalry Regiment in Taohutan and was dispersed. Coupled with the cold weather, most of them froze to death. Now, our Hedong line is very solid, and the enemy will never be able to advance further. As for the northern route, Sun used about two brigades of infantry and three regiments of cavalry to advance from Heguazi towards the Beizi area of A Banner. Because the area is sparsely populated and the entrances have been filled by the populace for a long time, and there is no food, coupled with the cold weather, which has reached minus six degrees, people and horses are dying. This time, Sun's army is advancing step by step, and central government orders are difficult to stop. Our army has a duty to defend the territory and cannot but make proper defenses. We have prepared the forces of the three provinces to respond in battle, waiting for the central government's order to launch a punitive expedition, which will not be difficult to annihilate. (Special telegram on the 19th)</p>
<h3>Wang Shiping and He Yingqin Request Instructions</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying sent a telegram to Chairman He of the Beiping Military Council: He Jun, I, Kuiyuan, am a martial man who has never studied. I am unworthy of being entrusted with military duties and serving the country with utmost sincerity. In the past, when Liaodong fell, the entire army gnashed its teeth. When the Battle of Rehe broke out, I was ordered to rush to aid. As the vanguard arrived in Chengde, enemy cavalry was already approaching Chifeng. I advanced hastily and encountered the enemy. Fortunately, the soldiers fought bravely and were able to avoid being annihilated despite being a lone army. When the battle situation stabilized, I was ordered to transfer defenses, without participating in the civil war. I repeatedly declared that the central government had thought deeply and planned for all sides, remembering that the Northeast had been lost and the Northwest was in danger. I was ordered to engage in reclamation and garrison the border in Qinghai, to control Xinjiang in the west and support Tibet in the south. The population is sparse, and wasteland awaits reclamation. The geography is important, and production is essential. It is my duty to serve the country, and I dare not refuse. Therefore, I led tens of thousands of hungry soldiers, not afraid of thousands of miles of expedition. Unexpectedly, as soon as I arrived in Ningxia, I received a telegram from Chairman Ma of Ningxia, refusing entry, claiming that he had received an order from Zhu Shaoliang, director of the Gansu-Shaanxi Pacification Headquarters, that the 41st Army was not allowed to set up supply stations or pass through Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai. I then received a telegram from Chairman Ma, stating that the vanguard of your army should immediately retreat to the vicinity of the Wula River and not advance any further, and that Qinghai troops had been sent to the central part of the area and a part of Hu Zongnan's troops had been sent to Haiyuan. Director Zhu would arrive in Ningxia in the near future. I then received a telegram from Chairman Ma, saying that since the central government issued the order for your army to reclaim and garrison Qinghai, it had not notified Ningxia. Now, Director Zhu has strictly ordered that your army not advance westward. The facts are there and can be verified. At that time, in order to avoid conflict, I ordered the troops to stop advancing. For several months, they have been stranded in the wasteland, suffering all kinds of hardships. The barracks are not enough, so they dig earth kilns. In the desolate area, the soldiers are poorly clothed and fed. The miserable situation is unbearable to describe. The primary desire of people is to survive. It is unheard of to die in the wilderness. Therefore, I consulted with the Shanxi-Suiyuan authorities to temporarily allocate the wasteland of Wolin for reclamation. The troops were sent to the Woye, but they still did not cross the west of Suiyuan, but due to geographical limitations, they passed through a corner of Ningxia. Ningxia again sent a large army to intercept them. All the details have been reported by telegram. Later, I received your telegram and immediately ordered the troops to stop going to Woye. I did not expect that Chairman Ma would fabricate reasons and report to you, falsely accusing my troops of invading Ningxia in order to distort the truth. Recently, I received a telegram from Ping stating that you had mistakenly believed the Ningxia report and stopped issuing supplies to my troops. I cannot help but sigh upon hearing the news. I believe that my troops have obeyed the central government and have not dared to deviate in the slightest. Although they have endured extreme hardships, they have no complaints. If you lightly listen to one side's words and stop all the supplies, then tens of thousands of officers and soldiers will not die under the anti-Japanese swords, but will die from hunger and cold. If this is the case, what more can be said? I am grateful for your care for your subordinates. At this time, I beg you to carefully examine the facts and clearly discern right from wrong. Then, the officers and soldiers of my troops will have no regrets even if they starve to death. I present this to you with utmost urgency. Sincerely, Sun Kuiyuan. (Special telegram on the 19th)</p>
<h3>Sun Telegram Claims to Have Obeyed Orders to Stop Advancing</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Sun Dianying's office in Nanjing stated on the 17th that my army began to negotiate with Director Yan to temporarily station in Woye in order to alleviate difficulties. The Ningxia side suddenly intercepted them, and it is not known what the intention was. I reluctantly fought back for self-defense, but in order to avoid escalating the matter, I have obeyed the order to stop advancing and await the central government's resolution. I hope that the central government will send a senior official to the front to monitor the Ningxia side to stop military actions and monitor my army to go to Woye to clarify the truth. (Special telegram on the 19th)</p>
<h3>Sun Dianying's Telegram to He Yingqin</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Wang Baoping, director of Sun Dianying's office in Ping, visited He Yingqin this afternoon to request instructions on two points: (1) Whether the supply fees have been deducted; (2) Whether there is a punitive order. (Special telegram on the 19th) (Beiping) Wang Shiping discussed the conflict between my army and Ma's troops. There is a saying that the Military Council will ask the central government to issue an order for a punitive expedition, which is expected to be a rumor. I personally inquired with He Gong, who said that there was no such thing. The recent conflict with Ma's troops has been ordered by telegram to stop, and there have been no telegrams from either side in the past two days, so it is assumed that the situation has eased. When asked about the supplies for my army, He said that they would of course be provided as usual. The reporter then asked about the situation at the front. Wang replied that he had just arrived in Ping from Shanghai and had not yet received any telegrams. If Ma's troops do not attack again, my troops will obey the order to stop military operations.

<h3>The Panchen Lama Arrives in Ping</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Panchen Lama arrived in Ping this afternoon. The date for his trip to Beijing has not been determined. The date for his trip to Tibet will be determined after meeting Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek in Beijing. Someone from Tibet had previously met with the Panchen Lama and sent him letters to welcome him to Tibet. The contents have not yet been ascertained. (Special telegram on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Liu Jiaju talked about the Panchen Lama's mission to Beijing: (1) After the Dalai Lama's death, the central government initiated a memorial service and made a forum to recite scriptures; (2) Mongolia's autonomy and the aftermath of Tibet. The Qinghai people extremely welcome him, and Ma Bufang also expressed his hope that the Panchen Lama would go to Qinghai. The Panchen Lama's trip to Beijing will delay him for two days at most. (Special telegram on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Panchen Lama talked about this trip to Ping and Beijing to attend the Fourth Plenary Session, report on the past experience of comforting the Mongolian border, and ask for instructions on future matters. He had a toothache in Suiyuan, and the date of his trip to Beijing must depend on his health and whether he is busy. He has not yet heard about the autonomy issue. He wishes to go to Qinghai as soon as possible on his future itinerary. He will go to Qinghai after attending the Fourth Plenary Session, but he is not sure about this at this time. (Special telegram on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the Panchen Lama left Suiyuan by special train on the morning of the 18th, there were slight delays along the way. He arrived in Ping at 3:15 PM on the 19th. The train stopped at Xizhimen Station for 15 minutes and then turned to Fengtai and entered the Beining East Station at 5:00 PM. Gao Shengyue and Zhang Jianhua, representatives of the Military and Political Committee, and Yuan Liang and Yu Jinhe, representatives of various Buddhist associations and various institutions and groups, as well as Mongolian and Tibetan princes and lamas, totaling more than 500 people, all arrived at the station to welcome him. The Public Security Bureau's security team, pistol team, and band were also at the station to provide strict security. After the train entered the station, the princes and lamas scrambled to pay their respects, causing a disturbance for more than ten minutes before the Panchen Lama met with the welcoming personnel and exchanged greetings. He was then escorted out of the station by guards and took a prepared yellow car to the Fengzeyuan residence in Zhongnanhai for rest. The staff included Secretary-General Liu Jiaju, Da Kanbu, Xia Zhiren, Da Zhuoni, and guards, totaling more than 100 people. According to Ban, he has a cold that has not yet healed. This time, he was urged to enter Beijing by the central government's telegram, so he tried his best to make the trip. He will stay in Ping for one or two days at most and then go south. It is difficult to predict whether he will be able to attend the Fourth Plenary Session, which is about to open, and he has not yet planned any proposals. Regarding the issue of returning to Tibet, he will be able to decide after asking the central government for instructions. After returning to the north, he plans to go to Qinghai first to organize the Xuanhua Commissioner's Office and promote the central government's goodwill in order to promote the unity of the Mongolian and Han nationalities and save the country from disaster.

<p>Qin Dechun Visits Chaisan</p>
<p>Negotiating the Chahar East Incident</p>
<p>Questioning the Japanese and Puppet Troops' Intrusion into Zhaojiatun</p>
<p>The Japanese Side Claims It Was Due to a Misunderstanding in Suppressing Bandits</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Zhaojiatun Withdraw to Heihe</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Heihe News: The Japanese and puppet troops attacked Zhaojiatun, Longmensuo, on the 16th. Because Zhang Renjie and other three divisions were calm and prepared, they firmly defended their positions. Knowing that there were preparations, the Japanese and puppet troops retreated to Heihe. Song, because this kind of disturbance by the Japanese and puppet troops could affect the security of Chahar Province, specially telegraphed Qin Dechun to negotiate with the Japanese side. Qin visited Military Attaché Chaisan at the Japanese Embassy this afternoon and declared to Chaisan that Longmensuo and Zhaojiatun are both west of the Great Wall line, and Longmensuo is 15 miles from the Great Wall. The Japanese and puppet troops' intrusion into Zhaojiatun this time is clearly an action that has crossed the Great Wall line. He hopes that the Japanese side will find a way to stop it. Chaisan replied that he was not in Ping when this incident occurred. He sent a telegram to Chengde to ask Military Attaché Genben. He has now received a reply from Nishiyiyi, the commander of the 8th Division, stating that it was a misunderstanding caused by the suppression of bandits. Now, the Japanese troops in that area have withdrawn to the east of Heihe. The original defending Japanese troops will never advance west of the Great Wall. He hopes to convey this intention to Song Zheyuan. Qin immediately reported the situation of his meeting with Chaisan to Song in Tianjin. A telegram from Zhangjiakou reported that the situation in eastern Chahar was very peaceful. (Special telegram on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) There is no activity from the Japanese and puppet troops in eastern Chahar. Although the Japanese army in Rehe has ordered Li Shouxin and other rebel troops to advance towards Baochang and Guyuan, there has been no active action so far. Our army is still firmly defending its original positions and is strictly prepared. It is rumored that the 8th Division of the Japanese Army will send a staff officer to Ping to negotiate, but this has not been confirmed. (Special telegram on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) We have decided to ignore the absurd warning that Japan previously sent to us because the Japanese side stated that it was not from the intention of the cadres, but purely from the lower-level personnel. Our side has sent Liu Shisun to continue negotiations with the Japanese side. It is heard that the Japanese side has telegraphed the 8th Division to negotiate, but no reply has been received in Ping so far. The Chahar East incident has been agreed upon by the Political Committee and the Japanese side to stop fighting on both sides. Qin Dechun visited Military Attaché Chaisan this afternoon to discuss a solution to the Chahar incident. (Special telegram on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chahar Chairman Song Zheyuan, due to the increasing pressure from the Japanese troops in eastern Chahar, in addition to ordering his subordinates stationed in the Chigou area to be strictly prepared, also sent representative Xiao Zhenying south to ask for instructions on how to deal with the situation. Xiao arrived in Beijing on the 19th and said that the Japanese and puppet troops had retreated to Heihe and Xifengzhai. The area around Longmen and Zhao Jiazhuang is now guarded by Zhang Renjie's troops and is now peaceful. He will return north after visiting Jiang and asking for instructions. (Special telegram on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhangjiakou telegram: After the death of Dong Futing, the old subordinate of Tang Yulin, the position of the commander of the First Brigade of Chahar Province, which he left behind, is temporarily held by his son Dong Hanqing. Zhang Renjie's troops are stationed in Chicheng, Zhang Yunrong's troops are stationed in Guyuan, and Song Tielin's brigade is stationed in Dushikou and Longmensuo. The defenses in eastern Chahar are properly arranged. The Japanese and puppet troops stationed at the pass have not succeeded in their attempt to retreat and change their strategy, and they are constantly preparing to use guerrilla pursuit of bandits to probe the reality of our military defenses. Their ambition has not diminished. Yao Jingchuan, the commander of the Baochang Garrison in Chahar Province, was summoned by Song's telegram to Tianjin to visit Song and report on the defenses in the Baochang and Kangbao areas. Song instructed him on the strategy, and he returned to Ping yesterday to visit Qin Dechun and report everything. Yao said that the Japanese and puppet troops' intrusion into Longmensuo was a probing nature, and its purpose was to advance if it could advance. The four characters reported in the newspaper that I had telegraphed the provincial government to report that the Japanese instigated the puppet army Li Shouxin to intrude into Baochang and Kangbao, which was not the case. Li Shouxin's troops are still stationed in Guyuan, in the second and fourth districts, and there is no action. There is no news of the Japanese and puppet troops plotting to disturb Baochang and Kangbao. The Japanese and puppet troops once again disturbed the area around Zhaojiatun, Longmensuo. After the Zhengzhenghui sent Liu Shisun to negotiate with the Japanese military attaché Genben, the result was that the two sides first ordered their troops to stop the conflict and discuss a solution. Now that the Japanese and puppet troops have retreated, we believe that Longmensuo and Zhaojiatun are both within the Great Wall, and the Japanese and puppet troops have repeatedly disturbed them, which is unreasonable. We have decided to send Liu to negotiate with the Japanese side for a fundamental solution to avoid further misunderstandings. (Special telegram on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Huang Fu said that the Chahar East incident has been negotiated with Japan, and the status quo is maintained by all parties. Personnel have been sent to investigate and then negotiate the aftermath in Ping. The investigation report had not been received by the 18th. The handover of the various passes of the Great Wall is in negotiation. I feel that in order to rectify the current situation, we should start by revitalizing the nation. The method is to be internally friendly and externally harmonious, to be sincerely united with the people, and to be harmonious with all friendly countries. It is of course impossible to be exclusively pro-Japanese, and it is also impossible to be exclusively pro-American. We must improve our own internal affairs and strengthen our national power in order to use diplomacy. We will handle North China's diplomacy in accordance with the central government's principles. After the plenary session, the central government will decide on our overall diplomatic policy to comfort the people. (Special telegram on the 19th)</p>

Although there have been casualties, their strength has not been greatly damaged. They have now fled into Wu'an and Shexian in northern Henan, and it seems that they want to flee south to Linxian, because the county is mountainous and known as a bandit's den, making it easy to occupy.

<p>(Nanjing) The Jiaoji Railway Council held a meeting on the 19th, attended by Chairman Wang Zhengting and directors Yan Deqing, Cui Shijie, Ge Guangting, Su Shenghai, etc. Ge said: 1. The points to be discussed by this council are the reorganization and development of railway affairs and transportation issues. 2. The Jiaoji Railway was built by Germany and occupied by Japan. When our country took over Qingdao, it paid a price of 40 million to recover the railway from Japan. The repayment of the loan has not yet been repaid. It is necessary to repay interest of 2.4 million per year. The operating income is about 1.6 million per month. After deducting all expenses of about 1.2 to 1.3 million per month and allocating the debt interest due to the Japanese side on schedule, there is little left. The average annual surplus is at most only about 3 million. In the future, it is necessary to start by developing business. In terms of operating income, freight accounts for the majority, averaging 75% per month. Passenger transport accounts for a small number. (Special telegram on the 19th)</p>
<p>The Sheng'an Steamer Robbery Case</p>
<h3>Involves Many Foreigners</h3>
<p>(Dalian) The number of people involved in the Sheng'an Steamer robbery case on June 28th last year is increasing. Matsumoto, the defense lawyer appointed by the Japanese court, recently requested the authorities to summon a German from Shanghai, two Germans, a Japanese from Tokyo, and two Chinese from Tianjin who had previously served as aviators, and a German who had served as an aviator, to testify here so that they could be questioned during the retrial on the 15th of next month. He also requested to summon a British man from the shipping industry, a Lithuanian man from the hotel industry, and a White Russian officer. Although the number of witnesses is not yet known, the involvement of so many foreigners in the case has attracted the attention of people here. The authorities attach great importance to this case. It is expected that the court's decision will not only have a significant impact on Japanese criminal law and maritime law, but also on the part of international law relating to maritime piracy. The chief justice in charge of the case told a Reuters reporter that the reason why the case was delayed until the retrial on February 15th was to facilitate the consideration and decision by the Dalian District Court authorities on the following two points: (1) Does the Japanese authorities have the right to try the five European nationals who are the main culprits in this case? (2) Has the defendant violated Japanese law? If the Japanese authorities do not have the right to try the foreign defendants, the court is prepared to dismiss the case and hand over the offenders to their respective consular officials for trial. If the court believes that it has the right to try the case, it is prepared to conclude the case within two or three weeks. According to Japanese law, if the offenders in this case are found guilty, they will be sentenced to death. If they are sentenced to imprisonment, they will be sent to the Lushunkou prison for detention. Matsumoto, the defense lawyer for the offenders, said that he is waiting for an opportunity to dismiss the case. He will base his defense on the following points: (1) The Japanese authorities have no right to try foreigners who kill foreigners on foreign ships outside Japanese territory. (2) The criminal conduct of the five victims is entirely piracy, and there is no Japanese law that can be cited as the basis for a verdict. (3) The German authorities are eager to extradite the German in the case for trial by the German court. (4) No matter how fair the Japanese court's decision is, the result will inevitably cause unfavorable repercussions. (Reuters telegram on the 17th)</p>

<p>Liu Zhi to be in Nanjing</p>
<h3>To Discuss Temporary Measures for Yellow River Control</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Zhi stated that in addition to attending the plenary session in Nanjing this time, he also plans to discuss temporary measures for Yellow River control with Chairman Chiang, President Wang, Standing Committee Member Song, the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission, and the Huai River Commission. After the Yellow River flood last year, not only Henan Province suffered severely, but Hebei and Shandong Provinces also suffered deeply. However, the dike project in Henan Province is slightly better than those in other provinces. However, the flood from the breach in neighboring provinces spread to Henan Province, making it impossible to prevent. Therefore, the first step in preventing future disasters should be simultaneous action by all provinces for easier results. The cost of temporary measures is estimated to be over ten million. Three methods are proposed for the central government to choose from: (1) Issue public bonds for Yellow River control, with the central and local governments sharing the responsibility for repayment in the future. (2) Allocate American wheat loans. (3) Railway surcharges. If any of these three can be chosen and implemented, there will be considerable results. In Henan Province, there are still more than 300,000 disaster-stricken refugees, and the provincial government is funding their resettlement along the Pinghan Railway. (Special dispatch, 19th)</p>

<p>England, America and France Agree on Stabilizing Exchange Rates</p>
<p>British and American Exchange Rate at Five US Dollars</p>
<p>French Exchange Rate at Seventy Seven Francs</p>
<p>(New York) The Commercial Daily reported today that the United States and Britain have agreed to maintain the stability of the exchange rate between the pound and the dollar temporarily at a ratio of five to one. The American Equalization Fund will protect the pound, and the British Equalization Fund will maintain the exchange rate of one pound at approximately seventy-nine francs. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) Reliable sources from leading financial circles in London stated that the US government has reached an agreement with the central banks of Britain and France to stabilize the exchange rates between the three countries, Britain, France, and the United States, and that they have agreed that the exchange rate between Britain and the United States will be five US dollars and the exchange rate between Britain and France will be seventy-seven francs. American banks here, representing the US Federal Reserve Board, are purchasing gold here at the newly set price. This move is actually enough to prevent the US dollar from rising further. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) The New York Commercial Daily carried a report that the pound and the dollar would be stabilized at a ratio of five to one, but insiders here do not easily believe it. Today, the US dollar has shown a reactionary trend in the London market, as the public believes that the current upward trend is only the result of general disappointment because the United States has not established a free gold market. It is expected that the US dollar will continue to rise temporarily, because the inflow of US funds has only just begun. The purchase of US bonds by Continental Europe shows that confidence in the stability of the US dollar is gradually recovering. American bankers estimate that US funds deposited in London are 100 billion yuan, and Canadian funds deposited in London are 50 billion yuan. Some sources say that the large-scale sale of francs was done by a certain legal bank in London, which is a sign that the French authorities are trying to prevent the franc from continuing to rise. Others say that the sale of francs was due to funds being transferred from Paris to London via London. However, well-informed sources say that the purchase of pounds in Paris this morning was because a certain party in France believed that, regardless of the US dollar, the current price of the pound was too low.

<h3>Gold Yuan Devaluation Plan</h3>
<p>US Abandonment of Gold Standard Forced by Britain</p>
<p>Equalization Fund to Prevent Being Threatened Again</p>
<p>(Washington) The House Currency Committee discussed President Roosevelt's dollar devaluation plan and passed it by a vote of fifteen to one. The committee prepared a report on the president's plan, saying that the United States' abandonment of the gold standard was forced by Britain. The government suggested using 200 billion yuan as a fund to stabilize exchange rates, the purpose of which is to prevent this situation from happening again. It also said that the United States has the right to self-defense, and that when the interests of the American people are threatened by other countries' low-priced currencies, the United States also has the right to protect them. This layer should be recognized by the public. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>

<p>(Washington) The Senate Banking Committee today amended President Roosevelt's request to authorize the Treasury Department to issue interest-free bonds. Committee Chairman Fletcher proposed this amendment, increasing the amount of bonds that the Treasury Department can issue by 25 billion yuan. Fletcher's move was on behalf of the Treasury Department, and Treasury Department officials said that this amendment allows the government to redeem any government bonds already issued with new bonds, thus making it easier for the Treasury Department to handle large-scale bond exchange businesses. As for whether this amendment allows the issuance of interest-free bonds in small denominations, it was not explained. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>New York Exchange Market</p>
<h3>Gold Pounds and US Dollars Compete</h3>
<p>(New York) The characteristic of today's foreign exchange market is the competition between the pound and the dollar. As a result, the pound closed at four dollars and ninety-six cents, lower than yesterday's seven cents. The highest value of the US dollar was stipulated to be quite low at sixty percent. Britain and France are afraid of adopting self-defense plans. This is the reason for the decline in the pound exchange rate. American funds have slightly flowed back overseas, and foreigners have invested in US securities again. This is another reason for the high price of the US dollar today. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>

<p>Cannot Disarm Without Agreement</p>
<p>Senate Votes Confidence in Government</p>
<p>(Paris) The Senate debated foreign affairs today and discussed the possibility of war, but not in the Pacific, but in Europe itself. Prime Minister Chautemps said that while countries are rearming, France cannot reduce its army and reduce its armaments. It can only be implemented after a future agreement is concluded. Several speakers expressed their belief that if Germany invades in the future, Britain will come to France's aid as in 1914. After Chautemps declared that the French army would never be reduced, the Senate passed a vote of confidence in the government by a large majority, with 257 votes in favor and only three votes against. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Senate's discussion of the question on foreign affairs has ended. Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Bérenger proposed a motion advocating faithful adherence to the League of Nations covenant and the Locarno Treaty, and trusting the government to engage in peaceful construction within the scope of the League of Nations, so that France's relations with various countries tend to be friendly, and to consolidate national defense and security. This motion was passed by a majority of 257 votes to three.</p>
<h3>Do Not Go Too Far Against the German Nation</h3>
<p>Before the vote, Prime Minister Chautemps restated the main points of Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour's speech, stating that France has always attached importance to the sovereignty of all nations and will never interfere in Germany's internal affairs. Chautemps continued, saying that the Germans fabricated rumors to slander France in order to arouse the German people's national ideology. This must have a dangerous impact on the country's foreign policy. It should be known that since the end of the European War, France has made concessions to Germany again and again. France's intention is nothing more than to express its hope for peace, and it believes that Germany has the right to restore its status as a great power, so it does not go too far against the German nation to make it difficult for them to endure. Unexpectedly, Germany did not understand that when the Geneva Disarmament Conference was about to reach a unanimously agreed solution, Germany suddenly withdrew from the conference. Can such an action not cause suspicion?</p>
<h3>France's Security Has Only Two Paths</h3>
<p>France believes that there are only two ways to ensure national security. If it does not rely on its own strength, it must rely on international cooperation. This view is very reasonable and should not be regarded as a contradiction. What we call disarmament means that we will implement disarmament in accordance with the methods stipulated in the general disarmament convention after the convention is established, and not that France should reduce its armaments at present, because there are still other countries that are rearming.</p>
<h3>British-French Compromise is the Cornerstone of Peace</h3>
<p>Chautemps continued, saying that France has always maintained its close compromise with various countries. For other major countries that do not have a close compromise with France but are the main factors for France's security, they also promote friendly relations, such as Britain. Our compromise with Britain is becoming increasingly consolidated, and it is a cornerstone of world peace. From this point of view, international cooperation is of great benefit to national defense policy.</p>
<h3>Always Faithfully Adhere to the League of Nations Covenant</h3>
<p>When Chautemps spoke about the League of Nations issue, he said that France has always faithfully adhered to the League of Nations Covenant. Even if the Covenant is amended, it should also be conditional on international cooperation, and a main body organization should not be formed separately by major countries within the League of Nations. As for direct negotiations on disarmament issues, they are based on the final result of the last adjournment of the Disarmament Conference, and should not deviate from the scope of the League of Nations Covenant. Therefore, although individual negotiations can be conducted by various countries at present, the Disarmament Conference should still be the final destination. In the end, all countries can conduct negotiations, but in any case, they cannot aim at rearming. World peace should be based on mutual trust among all nations, and the temporary balance of power and general psychological terror among nations should not be relied upon as the foundation of peace. Chautemps concluded by requesting Congress to grant him the necessary powers to carry out the policies he announced. All the congressmen applauded him enthusiastically. Lémery, one of the most important congressmen who raised the question, declared after the prime minister's speech that Prime Minister Chautemps had allowed for no reduction in France's military strength. At this point, the motion of confidence in the government proposed by Bérenger was put to a vote, with 257 votes in favor and three votes against. The government won. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>League of Nations Resolution</p>
<h3>Guarantee Danzig Constitution</h3>
<p>National Socialist Behavior</p>
<p>No Further Investigation for the Time Being</p>
<p>(Geneva) One of the important items on the agenda of today's League of Nations Council meeting was the constitution of the Free City of Danzig, as the League of Nations is the guarantor of the constitution of the Free City of Danzig. Recently, since the National Socialist Party in Danzig intends to gain power, several newspapers have been ordered to cease publication. League of Nations Commissioner Rusting (Danish) has reported this matter to the League of Nations. However, at today's Council meeting, the permanent inspector of the Danzig incident, also the British councilor in the Council, stood up and declared that the effectiveness of the current constitution has not been hindered in any way, and that the banned newspapers have now been republished, so the League of Nations does not need to investigate this matter further. The inspector also advocated that the Council should solemnly announce the meaning of the League of Nations' guarantee of the Danzig constitution again, that is, the progress of Danzig's public life should be based on the scope of the constitution, and the League of Nations is paying attention to this. Later, Dr. Rauschning, Chairman of the Danzig Free City Senate, reiterated that the current government of Danzig is determined to abide by the current constitution and will not dare to change it, and thanked the British inspector for the correctness of his statement. After Mr. Lau's speech, British Foreign Secretary Simon and French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour both spoke one after another, pointing out that the Danzig constitution has clearly stated the freedom of speech, and although the League of Nations is unwilling to exercise its power at this time, it still reserves its right to inquire whether the Danzig government is sincerely fulfilling its constitution. Simon's report was accepted by the Council. (National Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>Italian Representative Proposes</p>
<h3>Form Saar Commission</h3>
<p>Draft Preparatory Plan for Citizen Vote</p>
<p>French Representative Objects to Candidates</p>
<p>(Geneva) Italian representative to the League of Nations Administrative Council, Aloisi, intends to propose to the Administrative Council to appoint a committee to discuss the preparatory plan to be taken for the implementation of the Saar region citizen vote and submit a report before the Administrative Council meeting in May. Aloisi also proposed to add Argentine representative Cantilo and Australian representative Bruce to the committee. However, all sectors of France opposed this proposal and wanted to replace Bruce with Czech representative Beneš or Danish-Polish representative. (National (Geneva) Political talks are already underway outside the meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council. British Foreign Secretary Simon and Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson had a long meeting. French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour also met with Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu and Italian representative Aloisi to discuss disarmament issues, the Saar issue, and other events related to Romania and Italy, such as Austria and the Danube River Basin issue. Germany has not yet responded to France's memorandum, so it is currently difficult to estimate what decision the great powers will make on this issue. League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson, Vice Chairman Politis, and General Rapporteur Benes will hold a meeting at 3:00 pm tomorrow. The intention of the chairmen and the intention of Britain at that time may be known. As for the Saar issue, the Administrative Council intends to organize a committee of a small number of people, supplemented by several experts and consultants, to study the documents on this case, so that the Administrative Council understands the contents and takes all necessary measures at the May meeting to prepare for the 1935 citizen vote. The Administrative Council needs to provide guidelines for this committee, so before the end of this meeting, the Administrative Council will probably hold a secret meeting to discuss the main aspects of the Saar issue.

<h3>Unrest in Morocco</h3>
<p>France Continues to Send Troops to Quell the Chaos</p>
<p>(Paris) According to L'Humanité, Morocco continues to be unstable. The authorities have sent two more regiments of Moroccan soldiers to the southern war zone. The newspaper also said that there are now a total of 20,000 soldiers and 200 tanks in the war zone, but they are still not enough to quell the rebellion of the various tribes. It is heard that the authorities began to conquer the tribes ten days ago. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>
<h3>Japan's Lingering Ties with the League of Nations</h3>

<p>Harmonious Italian-Austrian Talks</p>
<h3>Austria is Tough on Germany</h3>
<p>Prime Minister Determined to Pay Any Price</p>
<p>To Cope with National Socialist Provocative Behavior</p>
<p>◎ Vienna's hope that Austria and Germany will issue a peace declaration during the visit of Italian Deputy Foreign Minister Suvich to Vienna has been destroyed by a speech by Austrian [Iron Man] Prime Minister Dollfuss here today. Dollfuss said that Austria has been忍無可忍 and is now determined to pay any price to fully restore order, because its cautious behavior has been misunderstood. There is now solid evidence that the German materials used by the National Socialists to make bombs come from outside the border. However, Austrians hope that there are rational elements in the National Socialist Party who know that the methods used by party members are wrong.</p>
<p>When Italian Deputy Foreign Minister Suvich arrived here from Rome, the station was heavily guarded. Outside the station, someone released three balloons painted with swastikas into the sky, and demonstrators shouted [Heil Hitler], which were repeatedly dispersed by police with batons, and many people were arrested. Suvich and Dollfuss had a long meeting. Dollfuss then said that the talks were extremely harmonious.</p>
<p>At the same time, dozens of students in Innsbruck demonstrated outside the German consulate. The consulate happened to be celebrating the anniversary of the founding of Germany and hung a swastika flag. The police rushed to the scene to prevent riots, but dozens of people were arrested.</p>
<p>(Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>◎ Today in Vienna, a crowd demonstrated in front of the hotel where Italian Deputy Foreign Minister Suvich was staying. Most of them were National Socialists and were eventually dispersed by the police, and a number of people were arrested. Shortly afterwards, demonstrations broke out near the Grand Theatre, and a battery exploded, extinguishing the lights on several streets and causing cars to drive around throwing explosives. National Socialists are very angry with Prime Minister Dollfuss for taking high-pressure measures. Yesterday morning, when Suvich arrived at the station, he gathered crowds to demonstrate. Albrecht, the Lower Austrian regional leader who was dismissed a few days ago on suspicion of secretly colluding with the National Socialists, was arrested again with two of his friends today. It is now believed that Mr. Ah will be detained in the political prisoner camp. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>Balkan Pact</p>
<h3>Negotiations in Final Stage</h3>
<p>Greek Foreign Minister to Geneva</p>
<p>(Paris) Greek Foreign Minister Maximos has left Paris for Geneva to discuss the issue of Balkan countries concluding a non-aggression pact with Czech Foreign Minister Beneš and Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu. According to Mr. Ma, the results of consultations with the authorities of Britain, France, and Italy on this undertaking are quite satisfactory. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>◎ Greek Foreign Minister Eleftherios Venizelos, who visited the capitals of England, France, and Italy and consulted with the authorities of the three countries on the issue of concluding a non-aggression pact among the Balkan countries, arrived in Paris from England a few days ago for a few days' stay. He recently gave a statement to the South China Morning Post's Paris correspondent, saying that the negotiations for the Balkan Pact have reached the final stage, but the timing of the signing is still unknown. This pact is to be concluded by Romania, Yugoslavia, Turkey, and Greece. If Bulgaria joins at this time, it will be very welcome. Otherwise, the four countries should sign the pact first and then join later. Mr. Ma earnestly stated that the results of his negotiations with the political figures of the three countries of Britain, France, and Italy were very good. The authorities of each country knew that the peace movement in the Balkan countries was a good example and encouraged and assisted them daily. Mr. Ma will soon leave Paris for Geneva to meet with Czech Foreign Minister Beneš and Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu, and then return to Greece, passing through Yugoslavia, where he will meet with the country's Foreign Minister Jeftić.

<h3>Professional Groups Law</h3>
<p>Unanimously Passed by the House of Representatives</p>
<p>Dictatorial Regime Becomes More Consolidated</p>
<p>Congress Exists in Name Only</p>
<p>◎ Rome This afternoon, the Chamber of Deputies held its final meeting. Prime Minister Mussolini declared [Before the end of the meeting, I dare to tell you in the clearest and most respectful words that the purpose of our struggle is the fascist revolution. Whenever and wherever anything is enough to achieve this purpose, we must seek to achieve it in every possible way. For five years, you have been loyal to the fascist revolution.] The House of Representatives then used a secret ballot to put the Professional Groups Law to a vote. As a result, it was passed by 358 votes to zero. All the members cheered the Prime Minister and then went to the fascist Party Revolution Memorial Hall. The 28th session of the House of Representatives ended there. The next House of Representatives will be elected in the spring in accordance with the law and will have the nature of a constitutional assembly. After merging with the National Conference of Professional Groups, the House of Representatives will still exist in name but will actually be eliminated. However, the form of the merger is not yet determined. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>French Railway Improvement</p>
<h3>Eight-Year Plan Proposed</h3>
<p>Requires Funds of Thirty Million Pounds</p>
<p>(Paris) Since the train accident near Lagny, Paris on December 24 last year, in which more than 200 people died and many more were injured, the authorities have sent experts to study railway improvement measures. An eight-year plan has now been proposed, with funds of approximately £35 million to be raised through the issuance of bonds, as the current railway bureau's income is not enough to cover expenses and cannot afford to increase new expenses.

<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt has formally announced that the United States will abolish all differential taxes on Russian imports and exports and special taxes on ship imports. This is the first step in promoting trade relations between the United States and Russia after the United States recognized the Soviet Union. Russia will order heavy industry, mechanized chemicals, and other items worth approximately US$50 million from American businesses, and Russian furs, timber, manganese, and other goods will also be imported into the United States in large quantities. Recently, more than 100 Russian business representatives have come to the United States. The Amtorg Trading Corporation in New York, which is the procurement agency of the Russian government, is also expanding significantly. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>

<p>(Paris) Due to a heated argument in the French Bayonne scam case, feelings soured, leading to two potential duels. Yesterday, Education Minister Mengzi and Assemblyman Henry O decided to duel after a verbal battle in the House of Representatives and appointed assistants. Although the assistants felt a duel was unnecessary, the Education Minister demanded that Henry O publicly retract his accusations, or a duel was unavoidable.

<h3>False Mass Demonstration</h3>
<p>Also Striving for Appointment Rights of Successor Russian Personnel</p>
<p>Illicit Road Purchase Negotiations Encounter Setbacks</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Russian Ambassador to Japan, Yurelev, visited Foreign Minister Hirota yesterday afternoon to discuss the problems of lowering fares on the East Railway, the abolition of gold rubles, and the burgeoning movement against the use of counterfeit currency. He stated that if such a movement continues to develop, the gradually normalizing relations between the Soviet Union and [Manchukuo] will deteriorate again. Therefore, he hoped that Japan would intervene to seek a satisfactory solution. The Foreign Minister replied that this was an internal problem of the East Railway and should be resolved through local negotiations. Next, the Russian Ambassador stated that if the [Manchukuo] authorities release the Soviet personnel currently arrested in [Manchukuo], he requested mediation so that [Manchukuo] would understand that the successors to these personnel would be arbitrarily selected by the Director of the Road Bureau. The Foreign Minister again replied that he would wait for the local negotiations. The meeting ended at 6:30 PM. (19th Electric News)</p>
<p>According to another report, when Mori Island Consul-General stationed in Harbin and Komatsubara, the chief of the Harbin Special Service Agency, met with Russian Consul-General Slavitsky on the 14th, Consul-General Slavitsky Feng Sen opened and put forward the condition that although [Manchukuo] released the Russian personnel, unless the authority to appoint their successors was entrusted to the Director of the Administration Bureau, it would be difficult to reopen negotiations on the China Eastern Railway. The Russian side suddenly showed such a strong attitude, revealing Soviet Russia's triumphant revolutionary diplomacy. The future of the Sino-Eastern Railway negotiations is not promising.

<p>Faced with Foreign Aggression, Failure to Plan Self-Defense</p>
<h3>Government Will Surely Be Despised by the People</h3>
<p>Stalin Painfully Discusses Sino-Russian Relations</p>
<p>(Paris) On December 25th of last year, Stalin, the General Secretary of the Third International Communist Party, gave an interview to a reporter from the New York Times. It is now published by the French Communist Party's organ newspaper [Humanity]. When Mr. Stalin responded to the reporter's questions regarding Japan, he said: [We wish to maintain friendly relations with Japan, but unfortunately, its power is not controlled by us. If a rational policy can prevail in Japan, then the two countries, Japan and Russia, can live together harmoniously. However, I am afraid that Japan's militarists are unwilling to adopt a wise policy, which is the real danger. We are compelled by circumstances to engage in preparations. A national government that fails to plan self-defense when faced with foreign aggression will surely be despised by the people. This is not what we want to see. However, it is unwise for Japan to attack Soviet Russia because Japan's economic position is not very good. It has weaknesses in Korea, Manchuria, and the Chinese mainland, and other countries are unlikely to provide assistance to Japan's opportunistic moves. Although those skilled in strategy may not be familiar with economic principles, they often fail to recognize the power of military and economic laws. It is a pity!] (19th Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>Amidst the Voices of Puyi's Ascendancy to the Throne</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Once Again Disturb Eastern Chahar</h3>
<p>Strange Phenomena Abound at the Ascension Altar Built in Changchun</p>
<p>Japanese and Puppet Troops Suddenly Attack Longmensuo</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Japan has decided to instigate the puppet Puyi to ascend the throne. The puppet regime is scheduled to issue a declaration on the 20th to implement a change of system. In recent days, in addition to preparing everything, Changchun has been building an ascension altar for the puppet Puyi to ascend the throne on March 1st. The altar is six levels high and one hundred meters in diameter, a truly unprecedented and strange phenomenon. The Japanese and puppet forces plan that after Puyi ascends the throne, they will first invade Chahar and then develop into Guan Nei. North China may be troubled from then on.</p>
<p>Amidst the voices of Puyi's ascendancy to the throne, the Japanese army in eastern Chahar has once again taken military action. The Japanese army is determined to seize Chahar as a preparation for defending against Russia. However, before the ferocious face is revealed, it will first adopt a policy of gradual encroachment, gradually invading westward. This morning, more than 200 Japanese troops from the Heihe area of eastern Chahar, together with about 700-800 men from Zhang HaiPeng's puppet army, carrying small steel cannons, machine guns, and armored vehicles, suddenly attacked Longmensuo east of Chicheng from Xifengkou and occupied the Zhao Jiaying and Wagou areas more than ten miles east of Longmensuo, attempting to attack Longmensuo. At the same time, two Japanese aircraft flew to the Longmensuo Chicheng area at approximately 11:00 AM today to scout our military movements. The garrison in Longmensuo, our side, is the Provisional Third Division's Song Tielin Brigade. Since the Japanese army's invasion, while sending a telegram to the Chicheng Division to forward to the Provincial Government for instructions, it has been making the necessary military preparations. Today (16th), there was a small contact at the front. As of 7:00 PM this afternoon, there were still conflicts, and the situation was tense. The Zhangjiakou Twenty-Ninth Army headquarters received a telegram from the front and reported the situation to Ping for instructions. Chahar Chairman Song Zheyuan is visiting relatives in Tianjin. The Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, Qin Dechun, in Ping, visited He and Huang in the afternoon to report the Japanese army's invasion and request instructions on countermeasures. He and Huang first sent personnel to negotiate with the Japanese side and will take action after clarifying the Japanese army's intentions. Tonight, Qin reported everything to Song by telephone. Song thought that the situation in eastern Chahar was critical and will come to Ping from Tianjin immediately to consult with the authorities on countermeasures.</p>
<p>The Japanese army's invasion of Chahar has been a predetermined plan. Although our side has seen through its conspiracy, it feels difficult in terms of both material resources and military strength. In addition to using diplomatic methods, there is no substantial preparation. The future is very dangerous. (Dated January 16th)</p>
<h3>Sun's Troops March West, Leading to Disputes</h3>
<p>Sun and Ma's Troops Have Been Locked in a Stand-Off at Shizuizi for Days</p>
<p>The Authorities Are Paying Extraordinary Attention and Have Sent Personnel to Seek Yan's Opinion</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Since the Anti-Japanese War, Sun Dianying's troops were first stationed in Chahar territory. During the era when Feng Yuxiang organized the Allied Army in Chahar, Sun himself, in order to avoid being drawn into the vortex, requested to enter Qinghai to reclaim wasteland. When the Chahar situation became complex, the authorities did not want this army to march west in order to reduce disputes. The authorities issued an order appointing Sun Dianying as the Reclamation Commissioner for the Qinghai Border Region. Afterwards, after the resolution of the Chahar situation, the military and political authorities in Ningxia and Qinghai telegraphed one after another to prevent Sun's troops from entering the territory. Therefore, Sun's westward march became a problem. At that time, in order to avoid other complications, the authorities made several attempts to appease the situation before finally ordering Sun's troops to temporarily postpone the westward march and spend the winter in the Baotou Linhe area before making a decision. This kind of arrangement was originally an expedient measure and not a fundamental solution. The authorities in Ningxia and Qinghai provinces could rest assured for the time being, while Sun's troops were not satisfied with their demands and were somewhat resentful. As a result, things changed over time.</p>
<p>Sun's troops were originally organized into an army, and the number of people has always exceeded the quota. During the Anti-Japanese War, they vigorously expanded and were reorganized into the Ninth Army Corps, with three more armies under its command. After the end of the war, the authorities ordered a reduction, still reorganizing it into one army, but Sun not only did not reduce it, but instead increased it, totaling about 60,000 people. However, due to the financial difficulties in North China, the authorities only paid the salary of one army, allocating 250,000 yuan per month. Sun's troops, with a total of 60,000 men, were restricted by the salary, and they were unhappy and always sought a way out to achieve their great desires. Since being ordered to stop the westward march, they have been waiting for an opportunity to move in western Sui, while still actively preparing for the westward march, and also asking Jin Yan for assistance. Yan has adhered to the Monroe Doctrine in recent years, aiming to transfer guest troops and reorganize the interior. He often considered the lingering of 60,000-70,000 hungry troops in western Sui a disaster. Yan was very willing to see Sun's troops attempting to march west. This time, Sun's troops launched an advance, hampered by the Central Government's orders, using the excuse that the weather in western Sui was cold and freezing, making it impossible to station troops there, and they needed to divide up the fertile fields to avoid the wind and snow. They had obtained Yan's consent beforehand, and Yan had helped Sun with 200,000 yuan. After Sun's westward march plan was finalized, they marched west on the 13th of this month and occupied Dengkou County on the Ningbian border of western Sui, and gradually advanced towards the Shizuizi area. The Ningxia authorities, Ma Hongkui, had long been prepared to prevent Sun's troops from advancing. A cavalry company was stationed in the Dengkou area as a warning force, and the main force was stationed in the Shizuizi area, because Shizuizi was the gateway to Ningxia, a strategic location that could be defended. In recent days, Sun's troops have arrived near Shizuizi and have formally made contact with Ma's troops. The two sides are currently in a stand-off.</p>
<p>After the conflict between Sun and Ma's troops occurred, it attracted much attention. Sun and Ma themselves also telegraphed each other to report the situation. The Ping authorities telegraphed the Central Government to request instructions, and at the same time, they telegraphed Sun and Ma to stop military action. At the same time, because Yan Xishan carried significant weight in the northwest, Hou Cheng, the Chief of Staff of the Military Branch, was specially sent to Bin to seek Yan's opinion. Mr. Hou left Ping by car this morning (16th) with a personal letter from He Yingqin to Yan. In addition to seeking Yan's opinion, the letter also asked Yan to persuade Sun to order his troops to temporarily stabilize and not advance west.</p>
<p>Judging from the current situation, it is very difficult to stop Sun's troops from marching west, and a conflict between Sun and Ma's troops is inevitable. Because during this period of national crisis, the Min war has not yet ended, and the northwest is once again engaging in fratricidal warfare, causing much worry for the future of the country. We must find a way to resolve the disputes to avoid escalating the situation.</p>
<p>This morning, because of the conflict between Sun and Ma's troops, in order to understand the authorities' attitude and the truth of the situation, the reporter went to Juren Hall to visit He and inquire about everything. He was busy with official duties and was unable to meet, so he replied in writing with three points: (1) Before the truth of the conflict between Sun and Ma's troops is clarified, it is inconvenient to announce the handling methods. (2) The situation of the conflict between the two armies is as reported in the newspaper. (4) I will not attend the Fourth Plenary Session in Beijing. (Dated January 16th)</p>

<p>Tianjin Correspondence: A strike by workers occurred at the Kailuo Coal Mine in Tangshan in recent days. According to the official report received, at 2:00 PM on the 14th of this month, contract workers in the Majiagou underground refused to go to work. When the police went to persuade them, some people from both sides opened fire. The police fired back, resulting in one policeman injured, two workers slightly injured, and one worker seriously injured. In addition, one child was seriously injured by a stray bullet. The supervisors sent by the Industry Department of the factory immediately went to the Majiagou mining area to discuss with the executive committee of the union. Because the workers' attitude was strong and obstructive, they did not accept mediation. There were still no results yesterday. Other workers from the Tangshan, Linxi, Zhaogezhuang, and Tangzhuangzi mines heard that the Majiagou workers were . . . [rest of section unreadable]</p>
<p>Xu He Bandit Forces Are Exhausted</p>
<p>Sichuan Army Launches Second Full-Scale General Offensive</p>
<p>He Long's Faction No Longer Has a Foothold</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The military anti-bandit affairs in Sichuan Province have largely completed the first phase of the advance and suppression plan after the recovery of Suixuan. On the 13th of this month, the second full-scale general offensive was launched. Deng Xihou's unit in one route and Tian Songyao's unit in the second route were responsible for the northern route and have recovered Zhao, Guang, and Jian, about hundreds of miles of lost territory. The main forces are stationed in Yiyou Ximai and will take advantage of the situation to go straight to Nanba. The Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Route Armies are all responsible for the southern route. Yang Gancai's unit of the Fourth Route Army captured Nanmuchang and Gaofeng Temple, which belong to Bazhong, on the 10th, and Xiangtanzi, which belongs to Yilong, approaching Jiangkou. The Fifth Route Army occupied Da'anchang, Shuanghechang, and Jinshanchang on the 13th, and pursued Maduguan the next day. The Sixth Route Army advanced to Luowenba, which belongs to Wanyuan. The encirclement has already taken shape. Bandit leader Xu Xiangqian concentrated his main forces on the Tongba front due to being surrounded and attacked on all sides and facing enemies on all sides. Xu and Chen Changhao and Zhang Guohuan and other bandit leaders went to Hujia Township to command, wanting to fight to the death. However, the morale of the Sichuan army is extremely high, but there is currently heavy snow in Sichuan, making it inconvenient for the army to travel, and both sides tend to be in a stalemate. When the snow melts and the ice thaws, the great battle will resume. It is reported that the bandits recently attempted to hold on to the three counties of Nenanba and were only allowed to abandon and escape elsewhere when absolutely necessary. However, Yang Hucheng's troops have a large force stationed in southern Shaanxi, and it is difficult for the bandits to pass through. In the future, they may flee from the Chengkou area to northern Hubei. He Chengzhen, the Pacification Commissioner stationed in Hubei, has made meticulous plans for this and built bunkers in all counties in northern Hubei and effectively blocked them, waiting for the opportunity to strike a fatal blow.</p>
<p>As for the He bandits in eastern Sichuan, since abandoning Qianjiang, they have no foothold and cannot communicate with Xu's bandits. They recently fled to Lichuan and were defeated by Jiang Zuojun's Third Brigade. They are still fleeing in the border area of Sichuan, Hunan, and Hubei, using the mountains to hide themselves. Xu Yuanquan, the commander-in-chief of anti-banditry in the border area of Hubei and Hunan, who is responsible for supervising the suppression, arrived in Hankou by plane from Shashi on the 16th to report the military situation to He Chengzhen and ask for instructions. According to Xu, the remnants of He Long's bandits have been largely wiped out thanks to the efforts of various units of our army. However, the mountains are dense and the remnants of the bandits can use the terrain to flee from here to there, avoiding the real and attacking the empty. Therefore, the border villages are constantly being harassed. A few days ago, the pseudo-Ninth Division and the Special Service Brigade harassed Lichuan and were defeated by Jiang Zuojun's brigade in a bloody battle. It is expected that they will be completely wiped out in due course. After reorganization, the local militia teams are mostly able to cooperate with the army, with remarkable results. However, local bullies use the name of clearing the countryside, but in reality, they collude with scattered bandits and local ruffians to harm the people. Honest gentry are not tolerated in the community, and society cannot be stabilized. Unless these people are eliminated, they will be an obstacle to bandit suppression. (16th)</p>

<h3>Financial Crisis Leads to Bankruptcy</h3>
<p>Over a Thousand Businesses in Bing City Fail</p>
<p>Merchants from All Walks of Life Request Government Relief</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Since the political changes in Shanxi Province in the 19th year of the Republic of China (1930), after the provincial currency plummeted, the province's finances have suffered a huge blow. Although various parties have tried their best to maintain it in the past two or three years, it has long been in a state of exhaustion and has become increasingly depleted. Recently, both rural and urban areas have gone bankrupt. According to official statistics, as many as 1,400-1,500 businesses in the provincial capital have failed this year, many of which are so-called well-established stores with capital of 30,000 to 50,000 or even hundreds of thousands. There are also newly opened stores, most of which are. . . [rest of section unreadable]</p>

<h3>Wang He Zhuang Child Kidnapped</h3>
<p>Wang He Zhuang, located in the border area between this county and Feng County, north of Yanduntou, is where a farmer named Zhuang Cai lives. Zhuang Cai has worked hard and diligently to build up a small fortune. However, due to the poor harvests in the past two years, household expenses have increased, and the economy has become increasingly strained. However, the bandits, unaware of the situation, suddenly came on the evening of the 18th. A large number of bandits broke into the house and looted at will. The victim, Zhuang Cai, resisted slightly, but was no match for the bandits. He was beaten and injured by the bandits, who took his thirteen-year-old grandson with them when they left, howling and disappearing.</p>
<h3>Public Security Bureau Investigates Household Registration</h3>

<h3>Seven Deserters Shot Dead on the Spot During a Search</h3>
<p>The Third Regiment of the Supplementary Brigade of the Second Division of the Army stationed in Suzhou, Xu Tingyao's army, Huang Jie's troops, has strict discipline and is praised by the people of Suzhou. On the 17th, thirteen soldiers from the regiment's mortar company suddenly deserted, taking fifteen guns with them. The regimental headquarters immediately notified the Shuiyi'an Second District to order all teams to pay attention to the whereabouts of these deserters and report them at any time. At 7:00 PM on the 18th, these deserters were suddenly discovered near the Xiangshankou on the shore of Taihu Lake, about one mile away from Mudu Xukou. They forgot to bring the temple, and they were preparing to spend the night in the temple. Wang Rongyi, the captain of the first squad of the Fifth Water Police Team stationed there, reported to the Water Public Security District by telephone, which was then reported to the regimental headquarters. Jiang, the regimental adjunct of the regiment, led the company commanders of Lou and Qi and three platoons of soldiers and four machine guns to depart from Suzhou on foot. They arrived at Xukou at 1:00 AM on the 19th and joined forces with the local water and land police security regiment to surround the Renqiao, Xingqiao, Xiangshan Zui, and Xukou Xijiang areas on all four sides. The two sides confronted each other until dawn at 6:00 AM, when the deserters opened fire in a desperate struggle. The soldiers immediately retaliated and opened fire for about two hours, killing seven deserters. Five were captured, and another was found in a reed nest, but only six guns were recovered, with nine still missing. The captured deserters were all taken to Suzhou and interrogated by the regimental headquarters.</p>
<h3>Horrific Murder of a Woman: The Murderer Zhang Wu Arrested</h3>
<p>The strongman Zhang Wu, a 33-year-old from Funing, was currently performing at the Xujiang Grand Theater outside the city and living in a small house south of the Dayang Bridge. Three or four months ago, he became intimate with Shen Sushi, a young woman from Zhenze, Wujiang, and they began living together. Although Sushi's mother, Shen Wu, also lived in Zhang Wu's house, she was occasionally dissatisfied with Zhang's behavior towards her daughter. On the night of the heavy snow, Zhang Wu actually beat Shen Wu to death. He carried the body to the area behind the new building of the Hongsheng Match Company, a cluster of coffins in a public cemetery, dug a hole, and buried it. The matter was extremely secretive, with snowflakes covering the soil and a coffin placed on top. However, yesterday (the 19th) morning, the incident was discovered by Guo Qilong and Ni Rong, patrol officers from the Third Sub-precinct, who reported it to the officer Chen Rongzhou. The officer dispatched police to investigate and confirm the facts. Zhang Wu, Shen Sushi, and neighbors Li Guangsheng and Lu Decai were taken to the precinct for questioning. According to Shen Subei's confession, she was 20 years old and had planned to sell herself for money, but her mother found her in Shanghai and brought her back to Suzhou. That night, Zhang Wu first slapped her mother and then severely beat her lower body, even stomping on her mother's abdomen. Shortly after, she died. Afterwards, Zhang tied both her hands and feet to a long bench until he went to sleep and untied them. She wanted to report it, but fearing she would be killed, she endured and waited for an opportunity to appeal. Lu and others claimed they did not know the details. They were all handed over to the Third Sub-bureau. Meanwhile, personnel from the local court arrived to conduct an inspection. When the other coffin covering the burial site was removed, a body was clearly visible in the snowy mud, with its upper body still exposed outside the soil.</p>

<h3>Theft Suspect Escapes from Detention Center</h3>
<p>Sun Hao, alias Di Sheng, a 28-year-old from Nantai, Tenth District, Wu Yi, was a theft suspect awaiting trial at the Wu Yi Detention Center. He had been behaving well, so the Detention Center Director Yu Liansheng had relaxed his supervision and assigned him to work in the kitchen. However, on the 18th, around 7:00 AM, the suspect escaped by scaling the wall after the seal was removed. By the time the guards noticed and searched everywhere, he had already disappeared without a trace. Director Yu immediately reported the incident to the County Court and the County Government, requesting assistance in the search. Upon receiving the report, Court President Cui Jiugong immediately dispatched Police Chief Liu to investigate. Chief Prosecutor Yang Kongyi also summoned the on-duty guard Zhao Donghai and the guard supervisor Zhao Jiyun to the court for questioning. In the afternoon, Court President Cui summoned Zhao and others to court, ordering them to be detained in the First Detention Center to await legal investigation and handling.</p>

<h3>Ship Sinks, Drowning Two</h3>
<p>Xu Huilin, a man from Yancheng, Jiangbei, in his thirties, made a living by steering a stone boat. His wife had three sons, the eldest eleven years old, the second six years old, and the youngest four years old, all living on the boat. Recently, they had been transporting stones from Anhui to Wuxi, docking at the train station wharf in this county. They were scheduled to unload the stones today and reload them onto trains to transport them to Baogai Mountain in Zhenjiang. Unexpectedly, due to the boat's age and disrepair, the bottom of the hold leaked badly. Yesterday (the 18th) at 10:30 PM, it suddenly sank into the river. At that time, Xu and his wife and children had already gone to bed. When they felt water on their bodies, they immediately got up to rescue the children. The youngest son was rescued by his wife, but the eldest and second sons were unable to be saved and drowned in the river, a truly tragic event.</p>
<h3>Local Budget Audit Results</h3>
<p>The local budget for the 22nd year of the Republic for this county had already been drafted by County Magistrate Yan. This time, Zhao Dihua, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, convened a meeting of county magistrates from various counties to the province on the 17th of this month to discuss methods for auditing and reducing county budgets. County Magistrate Yan Shenyu of this county was also summoned and went to the province on the 16th to attend. The audit results showed that the local budget for Wuxi, except for the land survey fees and temporary donations, was generally compliant and did not exceed the 101 limit. This was because County Magistrate Yan of this county had invited local gentry for discussions before the provincial meeting to review and reduce various revenues and expenditures. Furthermore, the expenses required for the People's Hospital in this county had also been included by County Magistrate Yan in the local budget for the 22nd year of the Republic, which attracted considerable attention from the province. It has now been decided to officially open on February 1st to benefit the poor.</p>

<h3>Fuzhou Launch Sinks After Collision</h3>
<p>In November of last year, Wang Liping and others from Jingjiang organized the Xincheng Shipping Bureau, acquiring a new-style Fuzhou diesel launch. It made daily runs from Xinsheng Port to Luojia Bridge and Baxi Port, carrying passengers for nearly three months. Now, during the winter break for schools, students from various places in Jiangbei purchased through tickets from Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuxi, and Jiangyin to cross the river. On the 17th, the launch carried 26 passengers, including three female students. At about 3:00 PM, while departing from Jiangyin to Xinsheng Port, it passed through the Zhanghuang Port river section and was struck by a black-hulled riverboat coming downstream. The Fuzhou launch sank, and the passengers, drivers, and crew fell into the river. Although rescue efforts were made by various boats, 15 or 16 people drowned. Yesterday (the 18th) at about 2:00 PM, the bureau learned of the incident after the boat failed to arrive. Manager Wang Liping and boat owner Yu Shicheng took a Yihong boat to the scene of the accident to investigate and await the retrieval of the bodies.</p>

<h3>Standardizing Weights and Measures Throughout the County</h3>
<p>The Department of Construction ordered the Nantong County Government to complete the standardization of the new weights and measures system throughout the county by mid-February and specifically scheduled a county-wide general inspection from the 25th to the 28th of this month, confiscating all illegal old instruments.</p>

<h3>Surveying and Mapping Expenses to be Reduced</h3>
<p>Jiaxing County is compiling maps, but less than two-fifths of the county has been completed. However, the expenses for the compilers are calculated based on the combination of the visually surveyed mu (unit of land) and the completed mu, with each mu being paid two fen and four li for mapping fees and one fen and two li for book fees. Currently, the visually surveyed mu are easily inflated, leading to excessive expenses. Yesterday, the County Government convened a meeting of various directors to change the calculation method to a per-number basis, regardless of the number of mu in a number, but still paying two fen and four li for mapping fees and one fen and two li for book fees. Furthermore, the tidal land must be reduced by one-fourth. This method will be implemented after it is approved by the Provincial Department. As a result, the salaries given to the compilers in various districts will be suddenly reduced.</p>

<h3>Actively Proceeding with the Construction of the Yuping Railway</h3>
<p>It has been decided that the Yuping Railway will first construct the section from Nanchang to Yushan and organize the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Company, which will be fully entrusted to the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway by the Ministry of Railways and the Jiangxi Provincial Government. The outline of the company's organization was approved by the Zhejiang Provincial Government meeting on the 15th. Director Ceng of the Department of Construction instructed the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway Bureau to start preparations and took advantage of his trip to Beijing to attend the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee to discuss the matter in detail with the Ministry of Railways and other relevant parties. Once he returns to Hangzhou, he can proceed. At the same time, Director Du of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, considering the heavy responsibility of this matter, felt it necessary to personally plan everything and planned to leave the hospital within a week and go to the bureau to make arrangements.</p>

<p>Revival</p>
<h3>On the Silk Industry of Jiangsu and Zhejiang (Continued)</h3>
<p>Shen Wenwei</p>
<p>Opinions on the reform of the silk industry can generally be divided into two factions: rapid and gradual. The gradual faction, represented by schools and government agencies, advocates improving silkworm breeds and silk reeling machinery to reduce costs and improve product quality and value to compete with Japan. The rapid faction, led by Mr. Mo Shangqing, advocates controlling trade, production, and raw material prices, and dumping on the international market to secure an outlet for raw silk, and then gradually engaging in technical improvements. In recent years, there has been considerable progress in technical improvements in the silk industry, such as a sharp increase in the number of improved silkworm breeds. In Wuxi, the improvement of the lotus root system in silk reeling has also been quite significant, as well as the rise of autumn silkworm rearing. In Zhejiang, autumn silkworm rearing has also gradually developed in the past two years. This is a fact that cannot be concealed. The reason why the silk industry is still declining is due to extremely complex economic relations. Mr. Mo Shangqing's plan to unify silk mills in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui is based on Mr. Mo's many years of experience in the raw silk trade, informing us of the importance of the raw silk trade. Mr. Mo's plan is divided into four points: (1) Sales (i.e., trade): using the method of controlling trade to prevent Japanese manipulation of the market and increase the power of trade competition. (2) Implementation: controlling the price of raw materials (cocoons) to avoid blind competition. (3) Production: paying special attention to the allocation of raw materials and labor, unifying the quality of raw silk to meet the needs of large-scale silk mills, increasing efficiency, saving raw materials, and reducing costs. (4) Finance (i.e., financial plan): the plan requires the central government to issue 5 million yuan in public bonds to be distributed to various silk mills, and silk reelers to invest 2.5 million yuan, totaling 7.5 million yuan. This amount is to be used as a advance payment, and interest-bearing loans of 30 million yuan are borrowed from the silver industry, totaling 37.5 million yuan. This amount is used to purchase cocoons produced in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. Mr. Mo's plan does make up for the lack of technology, but it is doubtful whether the financial resources are sufficient to compete with Japan.</p>
<p>The author wrote [China's Silk Industry and Socialized Management] in 1927 (the copyright of this manuscript was sold to the Shanghai New Learning Society in 1928, but it was burned down in a fire, and then revised in 1931, but it has not been published due to the recession in the book industry at that time). He suggested the systematization of the operation of China's silk industry. In 1928, he also wrote [Opinions on the Development of the Zhejiang Silk Industry], which he submitted to Mr. Cheng Zhenjun, the director of the Zhejiang Department of Construction at the time, and distributed to Mr. Tan Zhongkui and Mr. Zhou Junmei. Unfortunately, it was not adopted due to the economic environment at the time, and I still regret it today.</p>
<p>The so-called silk industry operating system means placing all departments related to the silk industry under a large operating body and giving them reasonable treatment, such as raw material policy, production management, trade methods, financial plans, and the improvement of rural economy, improving the education and general cultural level of workers, farmers, and their children, and especially focusing on the concentration of business, increasing production, improving work efficiency, and synthesizing business, that is, simultaneously operating various businesses related to the silk industry, such as making machinery, building banks, insurance, silk spinning, extracting pupa oil for the production of hardware, fuel, and daily necessities, purchasing, and consumer cooperation to reduce production costs and strengthen competitive forces.</p>
<p>6. Ways and methods to revive China's silk industry. The situation of the silk industry has changed greatly from 1928 to the present. In 1928, the silk industry was still in a slump, but it could barely maintain itself. Now, the panic is becoming more and more acute, and silk mills are closing down one after another. Farmers are even considering removing mulberry gardens and planting other crops. We are struggling to maintain it, let alone expand it. In order to restore the old appearance of the silk industry, I would like to offer the following business opinions.</p>
<p>The reasons for the decline of China's silk industry are very complicated, among which the main reason is the world economic panic, but there are special reasons in China, such as the Japanese raw silk's manipulation of the market and exchange rate relations, and the immaturity of technology. If we want to revive the silk industry, we must seek a solution from the entire economy and politics, but this matter is too big and difficult to carry out, so we can only passively deal with the internal problems of the silk industry in order to obtain a solution.</p>
<p>Recently, due to the rapid changes in silk prices, some small-scale factories in the Japanese silk industry have also been shut down. In order to seek an outlet for cocoon production, farmers have organized silk reeling cooperatives, which are the so-called cooperative silk reeling in our country. The benefits of cooperative silk reeling can be divided into the following points: (1) The cocoons produced by farmers can abolish the profit system of general business silk reeling according to the principle of cooperation, so it is possible to increase the price of cocoons. (2) The price of raw cocoons must be calculated according to the average silk price of the whole year, so it is not affected by the change of silk price and can stabilize the operation of the silk industry. (3) The quality of production is closely related to the participants in the production, so it can promote the technological improvement of the silk industry. However, in the past, Japanese cooperative silk reeling was not very developed because the scale was too small, the number of working days in the whole year was too small, and it was in the golden age of business silk reeling. Recently, due to various stimuli, it has been greatly rectified and has achieved a connection in silkworm rearing, silk reeling, and sales, so it can compete with general business silk reeling. If we want to revive the silk industry, we can only choose this way. In our country, the Linong Silk Factory run by Mr. Bu Mutao of Xifengyang, Deqing County, Zhejiang Province, is a model for cooperative silk reeling, but at that time, the factory did not adopt steam engines, the workers' technology was not skilled, and the management was poor, so it not only affected the decline of cocoon prices, but also caused misunderstandings among farmers and did not gain the trust of farmers, so it failed. The second is the Xiaoshan Dongxiang Silk Cooperative, Wuxi Huaxin Silk Cultivation Institute, Hangzhou Weicheng Company, etc. The above factories all adopt the special silkworm rearing cooperative system, but not the thorough cooperative silk reeling, so when the silk price fluctuates violently, there is still a risk of speculation, especially the silk reeling technology affects the low cocoon price, and the settlement of cocoon prices has no accurate method, or the selfishness of the operators is inevitable, and it is inevitable that it cannot obtain the belief of farmers. At present, except for Wuxi Huaxin, the other factories that adopt this system have closed down one after another due to poor business.</p>
<p>The most difficult problem in cooperative silk reeling is to determine the value (in terms of quality), price, and payment method of cocoons. The value of cocoons depends on the amount of cocoon layer, the ease of dissolution (difficult-to-dissolve cocoons directly affect the low production efficiency), and the quality of cocoons. In Japan, the value of cocoons is usually determined by mouth reeling (testing cocoon samples) or special testing methods. The mouth reeling method is to calculate the value of cocoons based on the results of the test reeling, and the special testing method uses instruments for checking the amount of cocoon layer and chemical reactions for testing dissolution to calculate it. Regarding these technical problems, it is impossible to describe them in detail in a few words, so I will not go into details. Although the price must be based on value, it must still be calculated according to the average silk price. The feature is that it is determined based on the average silk price of the whole year or the total average price per dan of silk. Cocoons with uneven quality and value are given a certain increase or decrease. Unlike business silk reeling, which is determined based on the temporary silk price and unreasonable methods, there is absolutely no speculation and danger in cooperative silk reeling. However, what we must pay attention to is the payment method. The poverty of the countryside has reached its extreme, so the need for cash is extremely urgent. Therefore, a part of the cash must be paid during the cocoon production period. In Japan, this prepaid cash is called [temporary crossing money], which means the prepaid amount of the assumed price. The amount is about 70% to 80% of the total cocoon price. The capital of cooperative silk reeling in Japan must be gathered by the personnel participating in cooperative silk reeling, and the central treasury and lending associations of industrial associations can be used to facilitate the turnover of finance. In our country, it is very difficult to gather this capital, and there are very few such organizations except for the Agricultural and Industrial Bank, so government subsidies or methods to guarantee the circulation of finance are necessary to succeed. The following is a draft of the principles for the initial trial implementation of cooperative silk reeling in Jiangsu and Zhejiang.</p>
<p>(1) Use existing factories. In Japan, the factories of combined silk reeling are usually built by farmers who raise funds, but given the current financial situation of the countryside in our country, it is impossible to make this investment, so in order to actively revive the silk industry, we have to use existing factories to make it easier and easier. This factory shall be selected by the Jiangsu and Zhejiang silk authorities in a certain silkworm rearing area, and the nearby silk reeling factory shall be suitable, but for the convenience of trade, the number of silk reeling machines for the initial trial shall be limited to 2,000 to 3,000 machines. If it is successful, it will be gradually increased. The government should also formulate regulations to promote this cooperative silk reeling.</p>
<p>(2) Finance. It is assumed that the designated cooperative silk reeling machine is 2,000 machines, and the average monthly silk reeling is about 450 dan to 550 dan. Each dan needs a advance payment of about 300 yuan. In one or two months, about 1,000 dan of silk reeling is calculated, and the circulating capital is about 300,000 yuan. The government should subsidize or advance loan about 150 yuan per silk machine on average. As for the cocoons produced by farmers, the cash of 70% to 80% of the assumed current price shall be prepaid. The government shall bear the responsibility for guaranteeing the circulation of this cash. However, cooperative silk reeling has no risk of speculation, so the credit can be stable. If the operation is successful, the bank will be happy to lend.</p>
<p>(3) After the establishment of cooperative silk reeling, the Jiangsu and Zhejiang silk authorities shall organize a cooperative silk reeling management committee to supervise financial business, guide cooperative methods and technical improvement, and act as an agent for selling products and promoting the benefits of cooperation.</p>
<p>7. Conclusion. To sum up the above points, cooperative silk reeling has a strong resistance to the changes in silk prices because the price of raw materials is reasonably determined, and has sufficient business possibilities. The financial aspect is stable due to the stable business and the credit is strengthened. Especially since cooperative silk reeling is based on the principle of no profit, as long as it can maintain the current technical level, the price of raw cocoons produced by farmers can be considerably increased. The excellence of farmers' silkworm rearing performance is directly related to farmers' interests, and the workers of cooperative silk reeling are mostly the children of farmers, so it will surely promote the improvement of silkworm rearing and silk reeling technology. At the same time, cooperative silk reeling is to promote technical improvement, so considerable education is given to the farmers and workers under cooperative silk reeling, and the education of farmers' and workers' children is also included, so as to improve the cultural level of the general society. At the same time, in order to closely unite with farmers, cooperative silk reeling must do its best to increase health and entertainment facilities to improve social welfare.</p>
<p>However, in the early days of cooperative silk reeling, the determination of the value and price of raw material cocoons must be accurate and fair in order to increase farmers' favor and avoid misunderstandings. At the same time, technical improvement must be promoted to increase the price of cocoons, and close contact and explanation with farmers must be made to gain farmers' trust and consolidate the foundation of cooperative silk reeling.</p>

<p>Those who took the night train to Beijing at 11:00 PM last night included Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Central Committee members Zhang Jingjiang, Li Shizeng, Chen Qingyun, Zeng Yangfu, Fang Shengtao, Zeng Zhongming, Fu Rulin, Yang Hu, Chen Shaokuan, and Guangdong Committee members Cui Guangxiu, Chen Ce, Zhang Huichang, and Dai Kui Sheng. Zhang Xueliang and others were originally scheduled to take the night train to Beijing last night, and the railway bureau had prepared a flower car. Due to business, it was suspended and changed to the night train to Beijing at 11:00 PM tonight.</p>
<p>Kong Xiangxi</p>
<h3>Talking About Rectifying the Land Tax Case</h3>
<p>Standardize the tax system of each province and abolish the surcharge</p>
<p>The Economic Committee decided to hold three standing committee meetings in Beijing</p>
<p>Xinxin News said that Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, came to Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday. After completing his official duties, he took the night express train back to Beijing last night to participate in the opening ceremony of the Fourth Plenary Session this morning. When Kong was in Shanghai, he met with reporters from Xinxin News at the Central Bank yesterday afternoon. According to the words, each section is recognized as a decision.</p>
<h3>Rectification of Land Tax Case</h3>
<p>Kong first talked about the case of rectifying land tax proposed by the Ministry of Finance at this plenary session. Although the written text has been ordered to be drafted by the staff, because Yu still has opinions to add, it has not been completely completed, but it can be completed within a day and submitted to the conference. As for the motivation for submitting this case, it is purely because the surcharges on land tax in various provinces are complicated and farmers cannot bear the burden. However, some surcharges added by various provinces are for legitimate purposes and some are unnecessary for legitimate purposes. The nature of the surcharges should be investigated. All those that are illegitimate should be abolished immediately. Those that have to be set up because they have legitimate purposes should also be abolished, but other methods should be found to remedy them and strive to standardize them. After this case is submitted to the plenary session, a principle can be decided in the conference. As for the detailed methods,</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance still needs to formulate them realistically.</p>
<h3>One Hundred Million Public Bonds</h3>
<p>Then the reporter asked about one hundred million</p>
<p>Issue of new public bonds</p>
<p>According to the answer, the issuance of one hundred million new public bonds is purely to repay the arrears of the Central Bank. In recent years, the government has allocated loans from the Central Bank and has accumulated 120 million yuan. Now,</p>
<h3>Huang Xuchu Arrives from the North</h3>
<p>Huang Xuchu, a member of the Guangdong Committee, left Guangxi on the 15th and arrived in Hong Kong on the 19th. Huang boarded the President Cleveland of the Dalei Shipping Company last night and left Hong Kong this morning. He is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the morning of the 22nd. Huang will go to Beijing that night to attend the Fourth Plenary Session. As for Central Committee member Li Fulin, he took the President Wilson of the Dalei Shipping Company from Hong Kong at 7:30 this morning and arrived in Shanghai. He also took the night express train to Beijing last night. Shang Guan Suran, Deng Qingyang, and Li Qilian have now decided to suspend their trip to the north.</p>
<h3>Contents of the Guangdong Committee's Proposal</h3>
<p>The joint proposal of the 15 members of the Guangdong Committee has attracted much attention from the outside world. Generally speaking, there seems to be a misunderstanding about this proposal. It is believed that the case of reforming the current administrative system proposed by Guangdong is based on Hu Hanmin's eight proposals and will inevitably propose to reorganize the current government and abolish the Military Committee. However, according to Cui Guangxiu's words to reporters yesterday, the contents of the proposal do not have such propositions. However, in the military aspect, it is advocated that the military should not interfere in politics. The troops are trained by military agencies in peacetime and completely listen to the government's command and deployment during wartime. As for ensuring the freedoms of speech, publication, assembly, and association of the people, they are also fully recorded in it. As for the section on the equalization system between the central government and local governments advocated in Hu's declaration, there is another proposal, that is, the second proposal of Guangdong, which was previously mentioned by the Japanese, to divide the country into several training areas. The case advocates that more local government committees should be established, but cooperation should be based on the principle of separation of powers.</p>
<p>All the Ministry will repay all the arrears to the Central Bank, which is not enough for 20 million, so the issuance will not circulate in the market and will have no impact on the bond market.</p>
<h3>Standing Committee of the Economic Committee</h3>
<p>Since the expansion of the National Economic Committee, the first and second standing committee meetings were held in Shanghai. It was said early on that the third standing committee meeting would be held in Beijing. The reporter specially asked Kong about it yesterday. According to Kong, the members of the Jiang, Wang, Sun, and Song families and himself will gather in Beijing to attend the Fourth Plenary Session, so we should take this opportunity to hold the third standing committee meeting in Beijing. As for the date of the meeting, it will be decided temporarily by the members after the plenary session is held.</p>

<p>Party and Government Leaders Host Banquet for Cultural and News Circles</p>
<h3>Discussing Ways to Stop Red Propaganda</h3>
<p>Unanimously Supporting the Central Government's Suppression of Bandits</p>
<p>Striving for National Stability and Victory</p>
<p>Five municipal party and government leaders, Wu Xingya, Pan Gongzhan, Ding Mocun, Tong Xingbai, and Tao Baichuan, recently held a banquet because of the Central Government’s victory in suppressing the Min rebellion and the concentration of all efforts on continuing to suppress the communist bandits. They believe news propaganda is extremely important. If a central principle is not discussed and determined, carelessness will cause confusion, and the military situation at the front is tense, so maintaining security in the rear is especially important. If news or writing published in newspapers is negligent, it will shake social order. Therefore, at 7 p.m. the night before, they jointly invited the main leaders of major newspapers in the city to exchange ideas and discuss ways to stop Red propaganda. The banquet was held at the Shanghai Lianhuan Society. Those present included Shi Liangcai and Zhang Yunhe of Shen Bao, Wang Boqi of Xinwen Bao, Zhang Zuoping of Da Wan Bao, Pan Gongbi of Shishi Xinbao, Qian Cangshuo of Min Bao, He Xiya of Chen Bao, and Huang Bohui of the Shishi Shibao. During the banquet, Pan Gongzhan gave a speech, generally saying that newspapers have a great impact on politics and society, Shanghai newspapers are the most developed in the country, and their influence is wide. At this time, the Central Government’s suppression of rebels and bandits has been victorious, and the attitude of each newspaper in publishing news is to unanimously support the Central Government. He, representing the Municipal Party Department, expressed gratitude. However, in the future, the Central Government will still focus on suppressing the Red bandits. At this time, when internal and external troubles are intertwined, we should all stand on the nation's position and not only carry out the suppression of bandits vigorously in military and political affairs, but also reject Red propaganda in the education and culture of the rear. Stop all activities of the bandits. He hoped that all newspapers would be cautious in publishing military and political news in the future and pay more attention to the text of the supplements involving leftist or radical elements. All texts that promote the proletarian revolution and incite class struggle should not be published at all. If newspapers have difficulties, they are also expected to frankly state them so that each other can reach a common mutual aid and achieve the success of internal security and foreign aggression. Afterwards, Pan, Tong, Tao, Ding and other gentlemen also hosted a banquet the night before for the editors of various newspapers, film journals, magazines, and news reporters. Those present included Li Liewen of Ziyoutan, Fu Donghua of Wenxueshe, Tang Zeng of Xuedeng, Xu Xingchu of Chenxi, Mao Dun, Pan Zinong, Xu Suling, Cui Wanqui of Da Wan Bao, Yuan Lunren and Zhu Yongkang of Da Mei Wan Bao, Yuan Xiaoyi of Wailun She, Qian Gechuan of Xin Zhonghua, Zhang Yiping of Wenyichunqiu, Yu Songhua of Shen Bao Yuekan, Zong Weigeng of Xiandai Dianying, Teng Shugu of Shishi Shibao, and Zhu Yingpeng, head of the Literary and Art Section of the Central Party Department, exchanged ideas and then dispersed.</p>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Takes Over Hai Rui and Hai Xiang</p>
<p>Hai Rui Will Serve the Shanghai-Laoyao Route</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company purchased two Norwegian ships and is now taking them over. The Hai Rui has already arrived in Shanghai, and the company has sent a business director to board the ship and take over transportation matters. Details regarding scheduled changes and flag protocols are as follows:</p>
<h3>Full Payment of Ship Price</h3>
<p>The price of the Norwegian ships Hai Xiang and Hai Rui was paid in six installments. The final payment of 30,000 yuan has been obtained and paid to the Norwegian shipowners by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Hai Rui was taken over by the company on the 18th of this month, and Hai Xiang was received on the 15th of this month.</p>
<h3>Appointment of Personnel</h3>
<p>Upon Hai Rui’s arrival in Shanghai, Shi Lianting was appointed by the company as business director, and the personnel of the tally department were also appointed by Mr. Shi. They boarded the ship on the 18th and began their duties. A business director has also been hired for Hai Xiang and will board the ship as soon as it arrives in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Change of Flags</h3>
<p>The ship originally flew the Norwegian flag. Now that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has officially taken over, the ship's smokestack has been painted yellow according to the company's standard to show uniformity. As for the flag, it should be changed to the company's emblem, but it is said that due to time constraints, it will be corrected and changed starting next month.</p>
<h3>Details of the Two Ships</h3>
<p>Hai Rui has a deadweight of 1,852 tons and is registered at 1,086 tons. Hai Xiang has a deadweight of 1,850 tons and is registered at 1,094 tons. Both were built in 1918, each being 261 feet long and 34 feet 6 inches wide, with fore and aft empty compartments of AP692. The machinery is Triple, with two large boilers using a steam pressure of 180. Each has only one deck. Hai Rui was built by the American Kerr Fluren SB factory, and Hai Xiang was built by Superior SB·OC. Because there is a lot of combined transport cargo from Haizhou, Hai Rui has been assigned to a special Shanghai-to-Laoyao route.</p>
<p>Snow Cleared and the Sky is Clear</p>
<h3>China National Aviation Corporation’s Lines All Flew Yesterday</h3>
<p>Shanghai-Peiping and Shanghai-Guangdong Northbound Flights Were Added</p>
<p>China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Hankou, Shanghai-Peiping, and Shanghai-Guangdong lines were suspended the day before yesterday due to heavy snow. Yesterday morning, the weather was clear and the planes on the Shanghai-Hankou section flew as usual in both directions. Although yesterday was not a scheduled day for the Shanghai-Peiping line, the northbound flight was added because it was suspended the day before yesterday. Today's northbound flight will still fly as usual. The southbound Shanghai-Peiping flight, which should have arrived in Shanghai yesterday, had to be postponed until this afternoon because it did not fly north the day before yesterday. The Shanghai-Guangdong northbound flight also took off from Guangzhou yesterday and stopped in Fuzhou. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai this afternoon. Huang Baoxian, director of the company's business section, did not telegraph to return to Shanghai and will probably have to stay in Guangdong for a few more days.</p>
<p>Minister of the Navy</p>
<h3>Chen Shaokuan Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning and Went to Nanjing That Evening</h3>
<p>Fujian and Xiamen Are Temporarily the Responsibility of Chen Jiliang and Lin Guogeng</p>
<p>Navy Losses Amounted to 500,000 to 600,000, Few Casualties</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that Minister of the Navy Chen Shaokuan took the Ninghai warship from Shanghai to Fujian on the 11th at 9 a.m. to preside over naval operations. Fuzhou has now been captured. Because the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee is opening and Chen is also a member of the Central Executive Committee, he took the original ship again on the 17th and returned to Shanghai from Fujian at 8:30 a.m. yesterday. After disembarking, Chen went to the Jiangnan Shipyard to meet with his subordinates, and then met with reporters from various newspapers to talk in detail about the navy's capture of Fuzhou. Chen himself took the night train to Nanjing last night to attend the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning and Went to Nanjing That Evening</h3>
<p>Minister Chen returned to Shanghai on the Ninghai warship at 8:30 a.m. yesterday and docked at the Gaochangmiao naval pier. Those who went to welcome him included Chen Xunyong, commander of the training fleet, Chen Zaofan, deputy director of the Jiangnan Shipyard, Luo Xuhe, director of the Navy Ordnance Department, Zeng Yijing, director of the Navy Aircraft Manufacturing Office, and Ye Baoqi, battalion commander of the Navy Guard Battalion, and many others. After landing, Minister Chen went to the Jiangnan Shipyard to rest and meet with his subordinates and reporters from various newspapers. At 11 p.m. that night, he took the night train to Nanjing to report to the Central Government on the recapture of Fuzhou and attend the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee.</p>
<h3>Announced the Recapture of Fuzhou</h3>
<p>Minister Chen met with reporters from various newspapers at the Jiangnan Shipyard at about 11 a.m. yesterday to announce the recapture of Fuzhou. According to him, he first went to Xiamen and then to Fuzhou, which took a total of eight days. Fuzhou was recaptured on the 16th. Currently, two brigades of naval infantry and many warships are stationed there to maintain order. After entering the city with Commander Chen Jiliang, he not only issued a notice to appease the people, but also declared that he was responsible for protecting the lives and property of foreigners. Therefore, the foreign soldiers who had landed have all withdrawn to their original ships.</p>
<h3>Navy Maintains Security in Fujian and Xiamen</h3>
<p>Before government administrators and the army arrive, the navy will temporarily maintain security in Fuzhou and Xiamen and handle post-war matters. Currently, the person in charge of Fuzhou is Chen Jiliang, commander of the First Fleet, and the person in charge of Xiamen is Lin Guogeng, commander of the Xiamen Fortress. As for Li Mengbin, commander of the Majiang Fortress, he is still stationed in Mawei. Currently, a total of more than 20 warships are stationed in Fuzhou and Xiamen and have tasks and will not be transferred temporarily. Until Minister Chen left Fuzhou, the army had not yet entered Fuzhou. The situation in Fuzhou and Xiamen has now returned to normal and is quite peaceful.</p>
<h3>Two Main Reasons for Retreating from Fuzhou</h3>
<p>There are two reasons why the Fujian rebels retreated from Fuzhou this time. The army was pressing forward from the front and the navy was pressing forward from the rear, creating a pincer attack, and the air force was pressing from above, making it difficult for the rebel army to defend. This is one reason. The tax revenue of the pseudo-government has been reduced by more than 300,000 yuan per month since the fall of Xiamen, causing a major economic panic. This is the second reason. With these two major reasons, the Fujian rebels had to abandon Fuzhou and retreat to Zhangzhou and Quanzhou.</p>
<h3>The Annihilation of the Rebels is Imminent</h3>
<p>After the National Army recaptures Fuzhou, it will definitely take advantage of the victory to pursue and attack Zhangzhou and Quanzhou. The annihilation of the rebels is imminent. As for the rumor that the 19th Route Army will be led and reorganized by Dai Ji, Minister Chen has only seen it in the newspapers and has not heard of it. However, the 19th Route Army has now been defeated. According to Minister Chen's observation, the future result of the 19th Route Army will be that some of them will return to the Central Government, some will become bandits, some will surrender to Guangdong, and some will abandon their guns and seek other livelihoods.</p>
<h3>Navy Losses Amounted to 500,000 to 600,000</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Fujian Rebellion, the naval institutions in Fujian have been successively occupied, and all the arms and ammunition have been completely plundered. Now that Fuzhou has been captured and the pseudo-government has been eliminated, the naval departments in Fuzhou and Magang have also been taken over one by one. The naval losses have been inspected and found to be 500,000 to 600,000. As for the navy officers and soldiers who disregarded their own safety and attacked Xiamen and Fuzhou, there were of course casualties, but the number was small and has not yet been determined, approximately less than 100. As for the losses suffered by the rebel army, such as the sieges of Lianjiang and Fuzhou, there were many casualties and injuries, and many were captured and disarmed. Currently, the wounded soldiers and prisoners of the rebel army are being held in Fuzhou.</p>
<h3>People in the War Zone Urgently Need Relief</h3>
<p>The people in the war zone suffered heavy losses in the Fujian Rebellion and suffered extremely painful oppression by the brutal rebels. Minister Chen deeply hopes that the government will provide relief and has sent Commander Li Mengbin to inspect the disaster area for presentation to the Central Government. Minister Chen did not meet with Sa Zhenbing during his stay in Fujian. Sa Zhenbing had nothing to do with this incident.</p>
<h3>No Proposals from the Navy at the Plenary Session</h3>
<p>Minister Chen is scheduled to go to Nanjing tonight to attend the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee. As for the discussions at the conference, they will focus on party and government affairs, so Minister Chen has no proposals on the navy to be discussed.</p>

<p>China National Aviation Corporation's Southwest Test Flight</p>
<h3>Flew from Vietnam to Yunnan Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reported that China National Aviation Corporation received a telegram from Anlisheng, chief pilot of the Southwest route test flight, and Nie Kaiyi, deputy director of the aviation group, from Kaubang, French Indochina, at 3 p.m. yesterday, saying that they took off from Kaubang for Kunming at 10:12 a.m. today. However, when they arrived in Kunming has not yet been received.</p>
<p>Jiaoji Railway</p>
<h3>Combined Transportation Encounters Obstacles</h3>
<p>Due to Japanese Merchants’ Opposition</p>
<p>Difficult to Achieve by the End of the Month</p>
<p>The Xinsheng News Agency reported that after the National China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Ministry of Railways' Combined Transportation Office signed a contract to handle national water-land combined transportation, the Longhai Railway combined transportation has been implemented, and the Jiaoji Railway combined transportation rules have also been negotiated and approved by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's board of directors. It will be implemented on a scheduled basis after the signing of General Manager Liu Hongsheng. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company plans to start at the end of this month, but according to yesterday's exploration of the shipping industry by the Xinsheng News Agency reporter, Qingdao's shipping industry relies entirely on the Jiaoji Railway's freight transportation, which has always been controlled by Japanese merchants. The most ships sailing are the Japanese merchants' Dalian Shipping Co., Ltd., etc., followed by the British merchants Taikoo and Jardine Matheson, and only three Chinese merchants: China Merchants, Zhengji, and Sanbei. Since the Jiaoji Railway was recovered by our country from the Japanese, the redemption price still needs to be paid for four years. Japanese merchants are strongly opposed to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's handling of combined transportation, resulting in obstacles to the future of combined transportation. It is feared that it will be difficult to achieve by the end of this month.</p>
<h3>Bing'an Will Open to Qingdao Today</h3>
<p>Checking Passengers</p>
<p>Offering Rewards for Arresting Thieves</p>
<p>After the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Puan was robbed and returned to Shanghai, the company is actively rescuing passengers and pursuing pirates. The company has also offered a reward to detect and arrest the pirates in order to crack the case as soon as possible. The follow-up news is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Offering a Reward of 10,000 Yuan to Arrest Pirates</h3>
<p>Liu Hongsheng, general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, forwarded the Puan's captain's report on the robbery details to the board of directors and the Ministry of Communications. Yesterday, the board of directors issued a notice offering a reward for detecting and arresting pirates, saying that the Puan was robbed on the 15th and nine passengers were taken away from the ship in the Yian Bay area. This unfortunate incident not only affects the national shipping industry but also destroys the patriotism of the Chinese people. In addition to telegraphing the authorities to strictly arrest and rescue, it has been decided that regardless of the community, if they can help solve the case and it is found to be true, they will be rewarded with 10,000 yuan. This notice has been distributed to all branches in Nanhua and ordered to be announced immediately.</p>
<h3>Puan Will Open to Qingdao as Usual Today</h3>
<p>The Puan is approved to depart from Shanghai to Qingdao at 9:15 a.m. today. The passengers who were robbed are still taking the original ship to Qingdao. The company telegraphed the Qingdao branch yesterday. The goods carried by the ship, except for slightly damaged pieces of cloth and cigarettes, have been notified to the passengers, and there were no other losses. They have been sorted out and the original ship is transporting Qingqi and unloading.</p>
<h3>Actively Taking Anti-Theft Measures for Ocean Liners</h3>
<p>After the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Yushun was robbed, the shipping department immediately planned anti-theft measures for each ocean liner. It was first decided to add iron fences, increase the number of maritime police, and build silver vaults. The ships included Xinming, Xinfeng, Yushun, Haiyan, Taishun, Guangji, and Jiahe. At that time, the shipping department estimated that it would cost more than 30,000 yuan, which has been gradually equipped. Now that the Puan incident has occurred, the shipping department has further accelerated the construction of anti-theft equipment for each ship that has not been fully equipped, and more armed maritime police have been added to each ocean liner to protect it. Passengers are still required to undergo inspection before boarding to avoid bandits mixing in again.</p>
<h3>American Cotton is Selling Poorly in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Only 3,000,000 to 4,000,000 Yuan Has Been Sold So Far</p>
<p>The Xinxin News Agency reported that since the American cotton and wheat purchased by our country arrived in Shanghai some time ago, various parties have paid close attention to the sales situation. According to a certain official of the Ministry of Finance, our country used the American cotton and wheat loan of 50,000,000 to purchase wheat for 6,000,000, flour for 4,000,000, and cotton for 40,000,000. Now the cotton and wheat have been purchased and shipped to Shanghai in batches, but the flour has not yet been purchased and shipped, and the purchase cost is higher than that of domestic products, plus transportation costs, which has caused our country a great loss. Checking the Sino-American purchase and transportation procedures, 10% of the price must be paid in advance when ordering, and 5% of the price must be paid when shipping. That is, before the American goods have arrived, we have already paid a considerable price. In other words, we have already incurred such debt. However, the cotton and wheat that have arrived are not selling well because the production of cotton and wheat in various parts of the country is also very abundant this year, and the market price of cotton and wheat has not increased, so the spot goods cannot be sold. So far, only 3,000,000 to 4,000,000 yuan has been sold. Even if all the goods that have arrived are sold, the income will only be 18,000,000 yuan, which is difficult to offset compared with the borrowed debt.</p>
<h3>Weining Gunboat Test Run Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Weining gunboat, a cruising gunboat used by the Coast Guard Office of the Ministry of the Navy, was still actively under construction after raising its flag on New Year's Day because there were still some scattered projects inside that had not been completed. It has now been fully completed and sailed to Longhua for a test run at 8 a.m. yesterday. The boat's captain, Xu Yuanliang, and the supervisor, Wang Zhiguang, etc., went on board and returned to Gaochangmiao at 1 p.m. It is scheduled to start its maiden voyage to Nanjing next week, and then go to sea for patrol.</p>
<p>Municipal Education and Culture Groups</p>
<h3>Public Banquet for Dr. Malek Tomorrow Afternoon</h3>
<p>Presided over by Pan Gongzhan at the Bank Club</p>
<p>Lecture on Danish Civic Education and Rural Prosperity in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Danish adult education expert Dr. Malek came to China for a tour and arrived in Shanghai on the 15th of this month. At the invitation of Jiangsu Provincial Education College, he went to Wuxi on the 16th to give a lecture. He returned to Shanghai from Wuxi last night and is scheduled to give a lecture at the YMCA at Baxianqiao at 7 p.m. tonight on the topic of [International Fair Trade Movement and Danish Land Policy]. Tomorrow noon, the Municipal Education Bureau, the Municipal Education Association, the Municipal Public Education Center, the Chinese Vocational Education Society, the Chinese Art and Science Society, the Shen Bao Amateur Continuing Education School, the China Education Film Association Shanghai Branch, and the International Problems Research Association will host a banquet for Dr. Malek at the Bank Club on Hong Kong Road. The above-mentioned groups discussed the preparations yesterday and elected Director of the Education Bureau Pan Gongzhan as chairman and changed the participation fee to 1.5 yuan per person. In the afternoon, he will give a public lecture at Wuben Girls' High School, and Professor Liao Maoru of Guanghua University will serve as translator. Dr. Malek's topic has been set as [Danish Folk High Schools and the Prosperity of Rural Society]. After the lecture, the Shanghai Branch of the China Film Education Association will screen a film.</p>
<p>Seamen's Union to the Fourth Plenary Session</p>
<h3>Proposal to Unify the Seamen's Movement</h3>
<p>Stop the Use of the Federation's Name in Guangzhou</p>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union proposed to submit a written opinion on rectifying the seamen's movement to the Central Government for review because the seamen's movement has not been unified. The main points are (1) to break the contracting system and (2) to determine the qualifications of seamen. Because the Central Government is about to officially promulgate it, the application was suspended. Because the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee will open in Nanjing soon, the union specially drafted a plan to unify the seamen's movement and submitted it to the plenary session for discussion today. The original text is as follows: (Plan to Unify the Seamen's Movement) The Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union has successively sent personnel to various branch offices to begin sorting out and is currently actively registering. However, the Guangdong Provincial Branch has not been able to send personnel to prepare for it, so the seamen sailing on the Nanhua lines feel the trouble of two unions and cannot afford the burden of paying fees and registering with both parties. The Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union has been exercising its functions since the Central Government's 73rd resolution to establish it, which has been six months now, and the 146th meeting of the third Central Committee has clearly ordered the abolition of the Guangdong side of the Chinese Seamen's Industrial Federation, which is still using its name to continue its activities and even force workers to join the union, causing the workers on the Nanhua lines to feel that they have nowhere to go with the union. In addition, in the Wusong Wheel tragedy, the Guangzhou side recently used the name of the Chinese Seamen's Industrial Federation to sign a settlement agreement with Taikoo Company. This situation is completely different from the purpose of the Central Government in establishing the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union this time. In order to strengthen the belief of seamen and unify the views of seamen, the Central Government should order the unification of the seamen's movement as soon as possible and strictly order the Guangzhou side not to continue to engage in activities in the name of the already abolished Seamen's Industrial Federation, so that the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union can carry out its mission in a unified manner and complete its mission as soon as possible. Is it appropriate to respectfully request a public decision?</p>
<p>Inauguration Ceremony for Executive and Supervisory Committee Members of Various Districts Under the Two Railway Party Departments</p>
<p>The fifth session of the Executive and Supervisory Committee members of the various district party departments under the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Special Party Departments was re-elected at the end of last year. In order to promote the party affairs work of the two railways, the association specially notified the newly elected Executive and Supervisory Committee members of each district to hold an inauguration ceremony in the association's auditorium yesterday.

<h3>Supervisor's Speech</h3>
<p>After performing the rituals, the oath supervisor Chen Fuhai gave a speech, roughly saying that today is the date of the inauguration ceremony for the fifth session of the Executive and Supervisory Committee members of each district of the railway. The district party department is the foundation of the party. After taking office, everyone will be able to promote the party affairs work of the railway and complete the construction cause. In particular, it is necessary to use the accumulated alimony to build houses in the stations along the two railways and complete the Shanghai-Hangzhou line. It is also necessary to use an active spirit to jointly supervise the employment and administration of the two railways.</p>
<h3>Representative's Reply</h3>
<p>Xu Liansheng, a representative of each district, replied, roughly saying that it is a rare opportunity to gather comrades from each district today. The speech of the supervisor just now is indeed a direction for all comrades to abide by and strive to realize in the future, and I hope that the superiors and comrades of each district will encourage each other and communicate with each other to promote the construction of the two railways.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Speech</h3>
<p>After the representative's reply, Chairman Chen Chengshi gave a speech, roughly saying that the two railway party departments have been established for three sessions so far. Although there have been no special achievements in terms of results, it is gratifying to be able to abide by the party's doctrine and protect the interests of employees. However, how the work should be supplemented and improved in the future is still hoped that everyone will contribute their opinions as much as possible to make the spirit consistent from top to bottom and promote the construction of the two railways. As for the important work that the association has completed and not completed in the past, please ask comrades Li and Zou to report to everyone. Then Li Dasan, member of the standing committee, reported the main points: (1) To assess probationary party members and recruit outstanding members into the party; (2) The two railway aircraft should pay the payment, which will be handled by the railway bureau; (3) The budget and final accounts of the association's funds have been completely decided; (4) The results of the propaganda conference to suppress the rebellion and bandits held in December last year were exceptionally good; (5) After the new house of the association is completed, everyone will feel convenient to contact us. In addition, he also reported to everyone on the important work that has not been realized: (1) Building a bronze statue of the Premier at the North Station; (2) Re-electing the trade unions of the two railways; (3) Promoting national goods; (4) Holding a party member speech contest. Then Zou Zhengjian, member of the standing committee, reported the key points of the work that should be promoted as follows: (1) Recruiting outstanding members of the two railways to participate in the party's work; (2) Expanding the national goods movement; (3) Preparing to establish vocational literacy schools and reading newspapers and magazines; (4) Organizing wall newspapers; (5) Holding various meetings on a regular basis and reporting on work; (6) The monthly expenses of each district must be reimbursed monthly. It is hoped that everyone will unanimously promote the realization of the above six points. Finally, Secretary Xie Chengzi gave a speech, roughly saying that the reason why the party's doctrine has not been realized is that some opportunists have destroyed and obstructed it. In the future, all loyal comrades should rise up to eliminate them, and they should also rise up to supervise all the measures of the government to ensure that the Premier's 100,000-mile railway plan can be realized as soon as possible. It is also heard that the two railway party departments continued to convene Executive and Supervisory Committee members from each district yesterday afternoon to instruct them on their work guidelines.</p>
<p>Huai Dehao Takes Over</p>
<h3>Acting Director of the Two-Roads Works Department</h3>
<p>The position of Acting Director of the Works Department of the Two-Roads Bureau, since Mr. L.P. Ridway's contract expired and he left office in the spring of last year, was entrusted by the Ministry of Railways to Mr. Guo Taiqi, the Chinese Minister to the UK, to find a successor. Mr. Guo then extended an invitation to Englishman AifrOqre Whiehouse. Mr. Whiehouse graduated from the engineering department of Kilzi University and served as an engineer in the British Western Railway and the Nai Quanlin Railway. He has certificates proving his service record on these roads. The Ministry of Railways decided to hire him, and he has already taken office. (It should be noted that the position of Acting Director of the Two-Roads Bureau was stipulated in the fourth clause of the exchange of letters between the Ministry of Railways and the Sino-British Banking Corporation in January of the 19th year regarding the management rights of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. That is, the Director of the Works Department of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway also concurrently serves as the Director of the Works Department of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway. In the event of leave or resignation for other reasons, all powers are temporarily handled by his assistant, who is called the Acting Director of the Works Department, appointed from among British engineering personnel.)</p>
<p>City Chamber of Commerce Telegram to the Ministry of Finance</p>
<h3>Extending the Deadline for Domestic Goods in Transit</h3>
<p>Merchants' Reasons for Application Should Be Permitted</p>
<p>Exemption from Completing Import Tax Payments</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Nanjing Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating that on the 18th of this month, it received a letter from the Guangbang Silk and Cloth Industry Joint Association, stating that its members, Gong Changhe and Wansheng South, had informed the association that on June 22nd, they had declared to the Zhongxin Heng Customs Broker for loading onto the Taikoo Company's Sichuan ship to Hong Kong for transfer to the Hengfeng Factory in Wuzhou. There were fifteen double packages of twelve-pound English Ball brand fine twill cloth, totaling six hundred pieces, which were entrusted to the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank for exchange to Hong Kong. They were preparing to continue shipping to Wuzhou in accordance with the deadline for domestic goods in transit. However, at that time, Wuzhou was suffering from a major flood, and all commercial activities were completely suspended. In addition, the silver industry was collapsing frequently, and remittances were invisibly suspended. Only after the market had slightly stabilized did they remit funds to continue shipping. Unexpectedly, the goods arrived in Wuzhou on August 25th, exceeding the two-month deadline for domestic goods in transit. The Cangwu Customs required the merchant to pay tax according to the method for overdue domestic goods in transit, treating them as imported goods, and the Jianghai Customs also urged the merchant to pay the domestic goods export tax of 142.79 yuan. The merchant had no choice but to pay the full amount on November 25th. Statistically, the value of the fifteen double packages of fine twill cloth was only over 3,000 yuan, while the Cangwu Customs' supplementary levy of import tax as imported goods was about 2,000 yuan. The merchant's capital is limited, and it has been unable to support itself under the impact of the economic downturn in recent years. If it suffers this punishment, there is no other way but to close down. The merchant has never dared to exceed the deadline for transit in the past. This time, the delay was caused by the special circumstances of the silver industry turmoil and the flood, which was truly a last resort and not an intentional violation of tax regulations. The facts should be fully disclosed, and the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce should be requested to telegraph the Ministry of Finance to take into account the merchant's difficulties and to quickly instruct the Jianghai and Cangwu Customs to allow them to be treated as domestic goods in order to maintain their capital and continue to operate, which would be a great benefit, etc. The letter was forwarded to the association. The association found that the domestic goods in transit must pass through foreign countries to reach their destination due to transportation relations. The regulations stipulate a two-month deadline. If the deadline is exceeded, import tax must be collected according to the example of imported goods. Whether the stipulation of this two-month deadline is too short, we will not discuss it in depth. However, according to national government orders, if there is a legal deadline for a certain event, if there is a real obstacle, an extension may be allowed, which is not unchangeable. For example, appeals to the court and company registration, although there are legal deadlines, are all allowed to be extended. How can customs duties, which are related to financial administration, be uniquely different? Moreover, transit through foreign countries is a special situation in our country, and since customs duties have been revised many times, transit tax is the lightest, export tax is the next lightest, and import tax is the heaviest. The Hengfeng Textile Factory fine twill cloth transported by the two companies was exported from Shanghai, and the fact that it is not foreign goods is obvious. If the regulations must be strictly adhered to, and an export tax must be supplemented in the place of export in Shanghai if the deadline is exceeded by two months, and an import tax must be levied in the place of sale, then the tax levied on domestic goods in transit from foreign countries is heavier than that on foreign goods, and the transit of domestic goods to the three provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan through Hong Kong is a common practice. How can market changes and local accidents be predicted? Once the deadline is exceeded, the supplementary tax is more than half of the value of the goods. Merchants will seek profit from their capital, and who would be willing to order goods from Shanghai factories again? This approach is tantamount to suppressing the vitality of domestic goods. In the association's opinion, if there is a real obstacle after the two-month period stipulated in the regulations expires, merchants should be requested to apply for an extension to avoid completing import tax payments in order to maintain the fairness of the law and the circumstances. The Gong Changhe and Wansheng companies in this case have already separately submitted a request to the Customs Administration. The department should be requested to carefully review and order the Customs Administration to allow them to extend the deadline and exempt them from supplementary tax payments, which would be fair and convenient. The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce respectfully kowtows.</p>
<p>National Goods Promotion Association</p>

Then, Representative Chen Yiting reported the details of the negotiation in Hankou, which was extremely detailed. Representative Chen Jusheng reported the general situation of the preparatory work in Hankou and Japan. The meeting ended in joy at nine o'clock. It is also learned that the association is scheduled to convene the standing committee members and the heads of various departments next Monday to discuss all the new plans for participating in the Hankou Exhibition to achieve perfection.</p>
<p>Red Swastika Society</p>
<h3>Two Groups Depart for Fujian to Provide Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>The Southeast Main Association of the World Red Swastika Society Shanghai Office, immediately after the Fujian Incident occurred, telegraphed the Fuzhou Red Swastika Society to rush to provide relief and at the same time organized a Southeast Joint Relief Team of twenty-four doctors, staff, and porters, intending to depart for Fujian Province to handle relief. At the same time, the Beijing Main Association of the Society also dispatched a North China Relief Team led by Supervisor Han Yongxiang and Captain Nie Chenglin, and the entire team of staff and porters arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. The President of the Society, Xiong Xiling, and others successively petitioned the Military Affairs Commission to instruct the front-line army, navy, and air force to provide comprehensive protection and to immediately submit a request to the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Security Office to telegraph the front-line troops to provide assistance and protection. It is now heard that although Fuzhou has been pacified, southern Fujian is still in a state of turmoil, and it is necessary to provide relief to the wounded soldiers and civilians after the war. It has been decided to send the North China Relief Team to depart by train to Hangzhou today via an intermediate route to Fujian to handle post-war disaster relief and reconstruction along the way, with Fuzhou as the final destination. All the staff of the association and various benefactors went to the station to see them off. It is also heard that the Southeast Relief Team will also be allowed to take a boat south to Fujian on the 22nd to join the Fuzhou Red Swastika Society to provide relief separately.</p>
<p>Minister to Panama Li Shijia</p>
<h3>Remitting Donations from Overseas Chinese for Relief</h3>
<p>Half for Disaster Relief, Half for Convalescing Wounded Soldiers</p>
<p>Sent by the Overseas Chinese Collection Office to the Relief Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Overseas Chinese Patriotic Donation General Collection Office specially sent Wan Changhu to the Joint Relief Association for Northeastern Refugees yesterday, stating that it had received a letter from Li Shijia, the Acting Minister to Panama, stating that the Colombian Overseas Chinese Anti-Japanese Support Association had presented a donation of 175 US dollars, half for disaster relief for Northeastern refugees and half for convalescing wounded soldiers. It was specially forwarded for verification and receipt. The original letter was replied to. The case was approved by the Standing Committee of the Central Committee after deliberation, and other reasons have now been sent. Comrade Wan Changhu has been sent with the original draft to contact and send personnel to cooperate with Comrade Wan to collect the money. The money for refugee relief should be issued by the association with political evidence, and the money for convalescing wounded soldiers should be returned to Comrade Wan for official receipts to be issued and replied to the acting ambassador. This is addressed to the Joint Relief Association of Shanghai Charity Organizations for Northeastern Refugees. The Overseas Chinese Patriotic Donation General Collection Office is supervising within the Shanghai Hospital.</p>
<h3>Li Guojie Unwilling to Move</h3>
<p>The Guard Room Must Be Moved Due to Other Needs</p>
<p>Fearing Accidents, Officials Must Be Consulted</p>
<p>The case of Li Guojie, the former general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, being accused of embezzlement and sentenced to imprisonment, has been appealed by Li to the Supreme Court in Nanjing, but there has been no news of a trial. Li is still being supervised day and night in shifts by multiple inspectors and police officers dispatched by Wen Hongen, the director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, in rooms 3 and 5 on the upper floor of the Shanghai Hospital in the South City. The supervision is very strict. Except for Li's family, no one is allowed to meet him. It is said that room 5 on the upper floor of the hospital needs to be set up as a baby room, so the guards are required to vacate room 5. However, the guards believe that room 4, where Li is staying, is only separated by a thin wall, and they fear accidents and are responsible for guarding. If room 5 is vacated, room 4 must also be moved at the same time, but Li Guojie firmly refuses to move. Therefore, the inspectors have reported the previous situation to their superiors yesterday for instructions to avoid errors. It is heard that Li has recently suffered from eye disease, and his spirit is weaker than before, his diet has decreased, and he sighs long and short every day. Li's wife is still in Beiping, and only two concubines in Shanghai visit twice a week. A few days ago, Li's former subordinates, old employees of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, out of consideration for the old man, were allowed to meet him. Unexpectedly, Li refused to meet his old colleagues because he had no face to see them.</p>
<h3>Declaration of the China Youth Anti-Communist League</h3>
<p>To Eliminate Red Activities in the Film Industry</p>
<p>The China Youth Anti-Communist League wrote: "Dear Sir, we hereby submit multiple copies of our league's declaration, hoping for your careful consideration and requesting that you generously allocate some space to disclose the declaration in order to arouse the attention of all circles. This is not only the country's fortune but also society's blessing. We respectfully wish you auspicious editing."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Chinese film industry was seized by a group of red writers and communists at the beginning of 1933 as a tool for propagating communism and inciting class struggle. The so-called four major film companies – Star, Tianyi, Lianhua, and Yihua – were almost entirely manipulated by them, and their productions were mostly infiltrated with proletarian consciousness. In order to revitalize Chinese national culture and maintain the proper development of the Chinese film industry, we had no choice but to use various means to awaken the Chinese film industry, hoping that they would not be exploited by the Communist Party. However, within the above-mentioned film companies, communist elements are still very active and continue to produce films that propagate red ideas and promote class struggle. Their harm to the country and poisoning of society is especially heinous and unforgivable. At the beginning of 1934, we solemnly make the following declaration to the film industry: (1) Film companies must absolutely not produce films that propagate red ideas, harm the country, depict class struggle, or provoke ethnic animosity. In particular, they must absolutely not confuse proletarian-conscious films with national-conscious films. The depiction of social pathologies and dark sides should also be avoided as much as possible to conform to the purpose of educating society. We also humbly hope that film companies will thoroughly change their style, take the revival of the Chinese nation as the main standpoint of new films, promote production and entrepreneurship, encourage the spirit of struggling hard to overcome the environment, and help improve the country's destiny. (2) Films that are currently being produced or have been produced but have not been publicly released, such as Star's "Twenty-Four Hours in Shanghai" and "Harvest," Lianhua's "Wind," and Yihua's "Golden Age," "Flames," "Flesh Fighting," "National Survival," and "The Wrath of the Chinese Sea," should be automatically deleted and revised before they can be rented and screened. If they cannot be deleted and revised, they should be stopped immediately. (3) Communist films that have already been screened, such as "Three Modern Women," "Torrent," "Maternal Love's Light," "Salt Tide," "Oppression," "Vanilla Beauty," "Dawn," "Women's Cry," and "City Night," must be automatically deleted and cut in their entirety. Anything that endangers national unity, provokes class antagonism, or propagates communist ideas must be thoroughly removed. (4) Tian Han (i.e., Chen Yu), Shen Duanxian (i.e., Ding Zhiyi), Qian Xingcun, Mao Dun, Shen Xicen, Lou Jiannan, and Xu Xixingzhi are all red writers. Companies must absolutely not use scripts written by them, and those who hold directorial positions must immediately have their employment contracts terminated. (5) Starting this year, for films listed in the second and third clauses, if the film companies do not modify them and formally announce the corrections in various newspapers and periodicals, no cinema in the country, regardless of location, may rent or screen them. Those who deliberately resist will be bombed with bombs. (6) Film publications and film supplements in major newspapers should also be particularly vigilant and should no longer publish film reviews that promote red ideas, otherwise they will also be served with bombs. In addition to submitting the above-mentioned principles to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government Military Affairs Commission, and the party headquarters of various provinces and municipalities for assistance in banning them, we have also issued orders to the local branches throughout the country to implement them thoroughly. At the same time, we have strictly ordered the investigation and action departments to immediately carry out severe punishment once they are discovered – punishing film publications, production companies, and cinemas that violate public opinion and endanger the country. Finally, we know that the reason why proletarian films have been rampant in recent years is that the members of the Nanjing Film Censorship Committee should bear a very heavy responsibility. Some people say that these committee members may be "insane" and blind for encouraging red ideas so much. In any case, they deserve the blame and there is no doubt about it. It is heard that a large portion of the films they have approved have been ordered by the Jiangxi Provincial Government not to be screened within Jiangxi Province. It is also heard that the central government has warned them and is conducting an investigation. Therefore, we will temporarily take a wait-and-see attitude to wait for the government to punish them quickly. If the Film Censorship Committee again approves the fact that a red film has been discovered, regardless of whether it is out of favoritism or blindness, its eyes will be gouged out to show a warning. This declaration is hereby solemnly made, hoping for the understanding of all circles. The Council of the China Youth Anti-Communist League, January of the 23rd year of the Republic of China.</p>

<h3>Alkali Fate: Falling to Death from the Eighth Floor</h3>
<p>American Pilot and Wife Constantly Quarrel</p>
<p>His Wife First Threw Down Two Children and Then Jumped Down Herself</p>
<p>An American pilot, Grochu, is currently employed as a driver for China National Aviation Corporation, living with his wife and two children (the elder seven years old, the younger five) in a newly built eight-story western-style public residence at the intersection of Route Petain and Route Cohen in the French Concession. The relationship between the couple is usually very poor, and they often quarrel. Yesterday morning, they had another dispute over a trivial matter, and Grochu went to the company to work. Unexpectedly, Grochu's wife had thoughts of厭世. At 5:45 pm, she led her two children to the highest rooftop on the eighth floor, first throwing the two children down, and then following suit and jumping down herself. All three had their brains splattered and died on the spot. After the nearby police found out, they immediately reported to the police station, and the head of the station ordered detectives to rush to the scene for investigation. They will notify the US Consulate to handle the matter.</p>
<p>Twelfth Session of the YMCA</p>
<h3>Important Issues of the General Assembly</h3>
<p>To be Held at St. John's University on January 23</p>
<p>The 12th National Congress of the Chinese Christian Youth Association will be held at St. John's University on January 23, as reported in the previous newspaper. The holding of this meeting will have a great impact on the work direction of the Youth Associations throughout the country in the next three years. The content of its important issues is listed below:</p>
<h3>Agricultural and Industrial Undertakings</h3>
<p>Youth Associations throughout the country are either located in important industrial centers such as Shanghai and Tianjin, or in important rural centers such as Suzhou and Wuhu. Therefore, the National Congress has specifically put forward the proposal of agricultural and industrial undertakings so that Youth Associations in various places can take these two tasks as their important work. At the conference, methods of engaging in and promoting labor work will be discussed, and Youth Associations in various places that already have labor work will be invited to report on their work achievements for other Youth Associations to learn from. In terms of rural work, it will be discussed whether Youth Associations should promote rural work with urban Youth Associations as the center or establish rural Youth Associations separately, and what kind of rural work Youth Associations should engage in should also be determined. As for the method of training rural cadres, it is also one of the issues.</p>
<h3>Social Work</h3>
<p>All kinds of undertakings handled by urban Youth Associations are part of social work, and at this conference, they will all be evaluated to see what contributions they have made to society. In order to achieve good results, a Social Work Committee has been organized before the meeting to study it. The committee believes that the social work of the Youth Association should be re-determined according to the doctrine, the times, and the national conditions, taking the new social order as the basis, seeking profound and concrete awareness, educational methods, civilian nature, and effectiveness to penetrate into the lives of the masses. In short, its work should be purely for the welfare of the masses.</p>
<h3>Student Affairs</h3>
<p>There are more than one hundred and twenty school Youth Associations scattered in various schools, and most of the urban Youth Associations in various places are located in educational centers. Therefore, student affairs is also an important issue of this National Congress. This topic has also been researched by a separate committee before the meeting. The old organization of Youth Associations in various schools focused on rigid departments and seemed unable to effectively meet the needs of the school. Therefore, the future organization should focus on lively and vibrant small fellowships, and the lives of the members of the school Youth Association should also establish standards for training. The training of students and staff in office skills and the recruitment and training of student cadres are also one of the issues of this National Congress.</p>
<p>It is also heard that the convening of this National Congress in Shanghai has attracted the attention of various circles in Shanghai. China Travel Service and Shanghai Bank will set up offices at St. John's University during the meeting. The National Film Education Promotion Office will screen educational films for representatives during the meeting for publicity purposes. National goods companies will also send staff to distribute gifts to the representatives of the National Youth Association. At the same time, a National Youth Association Work Exhibition will also be held.</p>
<p>Second District Police Department</p>
<h3>Cracking Down on a Large Number of Thieves</h3>
<p>Transferred from Kunshan</p>
<p>And Arrested in Shanghai</p>
<p>Li, the district chief of the Second District of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, learned that a robbery had occurred in the Changtai Cigarette and Paper Store opened by Mr. Xia in No. 18, West Gate, Lane 35, Gaochang Temple, within the jurisdiction of this district, and at the same time, the Wanxing Cigarette and Paper Store opened by Mr. Lin Shi in No. 1, Chengzhi Lane, opposite, was also robbed. In addition, the home of Cao Musheng (who is a member of the Security Corps) in Xiaomuqiao, Longhua Road, was robbed by bandits of 450 silver dollars, 74 small silver dollars, and clothing. In addition, the Dacheng Cigarette and Paper Store opened by Mr. Zhu Xikun in No. 457, Damuqiao, was robbed of silver dollars. For the above cases, District Chief Li strictly ordered Liu Shaoqing, the leader of the detective team stationed in the district, to order detectives to purchase leads, which have been solved. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Process of Arrest</h3>
<p>At about 8 pm on the 12th of this month, Liu Shaoqing, the leader of the team, ordered detective Lu Lingen to report secretly that he had seen the thief Shang Ziqin at No. 81, Longhua Road. At that time, the detective was unable to return to the district to report, so he immediately reported to the patrol police nearby for assistance in arresting the thief Shang Ziqin. After questioning, Shang confessed that his accomplices Li Degui and Wei Caifeng were hiding in the Tofu Shop in Sanyuan Street, Shiqiang Town, Kunshan City, and that the pistol was also hidden in that place. District Chief Li and Team Leader Liu reported to Wen Hongen, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and Lu Ying, Captain of the Detective Team, separately, and prepared a letter to the Kunshan County Government. Team Leader Liu Shaoqing was still ordered to lead detectives Fang Lingen, Shi Chunlin, Gu Rusheng, Cheng Peizhang, Wang Gengsheng, and Zhou Jizhen to hold the document on the 13th of this month and go to Kunshan to meet with the police officers of the county government to secretly go to the above-mentioned location. Li Degui and Wei Caifeng were arrested on the spot and taken to Shanghai for questioning. They confessed that there was a pistol hidden in a mud cave under the bed in the bedroom, etc. On the 17th of this month, the original detectives Fang Lingen, etc. went to Kunshan again to retrieve a six-inch white pistol with the number 38245, three bullets, and a gun clip from Xu Mingjiu, a suspect (Xu is the owner of a tofu shop and is a gentleman in the town. All the partners used by the shop are from Hefei, Anhui, so there is this suspicion) and took them to Shanghai to be questioned. On one side, District Chief Li ordered Team Leader Liu to lead detectives Cheng Peizhang, Yang Jinchen, Gu Rusheng, and Shi Chunlin to take Wei and others to the Sixth District to meet with the chief and police of the Second Sub-Office of the district to arrest Xu Chuanliang (i.e., Xu Wu) and his mistress Xu Liu at No. 37, Xinsen Lane, Hongqiao Road. After questioning in the district, at about 2 am today, the original detectives were sent again to take the suspect to arrest Wang Xinyun at No. 26, Houjiazhai. After questioning in the district, at about 8 am on the 17th, detective Fang Lingen received a report from an informant, Lu Desan, and the detectives and patrol police arrested the thief Zhang Chengyi at the railway side of the South Railway Station, and Zhang also confessed the suspect Hu Guoqing, who was taken to the district for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Confessions in Pieces</h3>
<p>According to the confession of the thief Li Degui arrested in Kunshan, he first partnered with Wang Degui and others to rob Xu Dayuan's home at No. 6, Songsheng Lane, Kangqu Road, Jumen Road. He firmly claimed that the pistol was stolen by Yang Haishan from a milk shed in the French Concession. Wei Caifeng confessed that he partnered with Huang Siqiaozi, Zhang Chengyi, etc. to rob a grocery store in a bungalow at the intersection of Xiaomuqiao and Xietu Road, and robbed the cigarette and paper store in Damuqiao. Xu Chuanliang (Xu Wu) confessed that the robbery case on Hongqiao Road was indeed a conspiracy, but he firmly denied the other cases. Xu Liu confessed that she did not send a pistol to Zhang Chengyi on his behalf or on behalf of her husband. Wang Xinyun confessed that she had been making a living by weaving cloth and did not dare to be a bandit. Zhang Chengyi also claimed that he partnered to rob a pharmacy near the Rihui Bridge and a cigarette and paper store next to it, and robbed Cao Musheng's home at No. 48, Xiaomuqiao, of 450 yuan, and robbed a cigarette and paper store on the south side of the railway. According to the suspect Xu Mingjiu, he has been doing business in Kunshan. Although the person named Wei is from the same hometown, he really does not know that they have committed illegal acts. He asks for leniency and asks to check to know the truth. Hu Guoqing confessed that he used to make a living by delivering opium and collecting flower parties, and that he had never been involved in robberies.</p>
<h3>Ages and Origins of the Suspects</h3>
<p>After District Chief Li questioned the above-mentioned suspects one by one, he ordered Team Leader Liu to send detectives Fang Lingen and others to the French Concession to meet with the Songshan Road police station to retrieve the stolen goods from the Xieda Pawnshop, etc. Except for one Huang Siqiaozi who has been arrested and sent to the Sixth District, all the fugitives Wang Xuegui, Xiaoshandong, Xiaowang, Yang Haishan, etc. are still ordered to be arrested by the detectives separately. The suspects who have been reported to the General Bureau for questioning are recorded as follows: Thief Shang Ziqin, 25 years old, Hefei, Anhui; Li Degui, 38 years old, Hefei, Anhui; Wei Caifeng (Yonghai), 32 years old, Hefei; Zhang Chengyi, 28 years old, Hefei; Xu Chuanliang (Xu Wu), 32 years old, Hefei; Xu Liu, 31 years old, Hefei; Suspect Hu Guoqing, 27 years old, Hefei; Wang Xinyun, 25 years old, Hefei; Xu Mingjiu, 38 years old, Hefei.</p>

<p>According to Lu Ying, the leader of the detective squad of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, based on information from Chen Caifu, a detective foreman, there is a notorious rogue from Chongming named Wang Chongfu (age 40) in the Shanghai's Nanshi, Shiliupu Ning Shao Wharf area, who colludes with accomplices from Nanjing, Bu Hongsheng, and from Ningbo, Le Aliu and Chen Afa, to entice gamblers to gather on the barge of Gu Aer (age 45) from Yancheng, to gamble and collect a commission. Every night, they gamble by shaking dice and the stakes are quite high. Wang and his gang profit handsomely from this. After Lu Ying verified the information, he immediately instructed the foreman to lead a large number of detectives, together with Zhu Haishan, the captain of the water patrol team in charge of the area, and dispatched Deputy Captain Li Chenghua and several police officers to take a patrol launch to the No. 3 Garbage Wharf in Nanshi around 5 PM the night before. Approaching the barge, they could already hear the gamblers yelling and shouting from outside the boat. The detectives then rushed into the front and rear cabins. When the gamblers saw the detectives, they all tried to jump into the river to escape, causing chaos. The officers arrested the gambling ringleader Wang Chongfu, the boat owner Gu Aer, and other gamblers, including Bu Hongsheng, Xu Ziqing, Qin Kaopeng, Shi Ruilin, Li Guangli, Zhu Ahu, Chen Agen, Zhang Afa, and a total of twenty-five people. They seized gambling equipment such as shaking pots, dice, money boards, small iron boxes, and gambling money of forty dollars in silver and sixty-six cents in small coins on the spot. They then took the team and transferred the case to the Third Section for handling.</p>

<p>Cashing Out Funds</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that someone, likely a foreigner, forged an Anglo-American Tobacco Company check for a six-figure sum this week and cashed it at the Mercantile Bank.

Bank staff did not initially notice anything until yesterday when they received another check for over 100,000 yuan, signed by a senior executive of the Anglo-American Tobacco Company. Suspecting something was amiss, they inquired with the company and were shocked to learn that both the check cashed a few days ago and the check presented yesterday were forged. It is still unknown whether the check was forged by the signatory himself or someone else. According to Anglo-American Tobacco Company staff, the first check was countersigned by a foreigner who had deposited 800 yuan in the bank a few days before the exchange. The forged signature was said to be very similar to the real one, making it difficult to detect. According to police sources, the person must be familiar with the true signature method. A thorough investigation is underway in hopes of apprehending the criminal as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor: In the local news column of your newspaper on January 14th, there was a news item stating that our factory "continues to use enemy goods without repentance." After reading it, we were shocked and horrified to find that it was completely untrue. Since the September 18th Incident, our factory has never purchased enemy goods. We are not only innocent in our conscience, but it is also well known to our colleagues. As for the enemy goods purchased by Xiangtai before the September 18th Incident and not yet sold, they were disposed of in accordance with the resolution of the Iron Industry Association on the handling of enemy goods, and our factory was entrusted to melt the goods on their behalf. Our factory refused early on, which was also well known to the association. This matter concerns the reputation of our factory and it is difficult to remain silent. We hereby request that your newspaper publish this letter in the letters to the editor column to clarify the truth and express our gratitude. Sincerely, Xiangmeng Foundry, January 19th.</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor: I am writing to express my surprise at the news in the local news column of your newspaper regarding a "Hundred Embroidery Competition to be held by our organization in early spring." After investigation, our country has no such competition planned. We hereby correct this to avoid misunderstandings. We hope that this letter will be published to prevent public confusion. Sincerely, Shanghai Municipal Zoo, January 19th.</p>

<p>Special Article</p>
<h3>The Crossroads of the Japanese Nation by Wu Tiecheng</h3>
<p>Editor's Note: This article was written by Mayor Wu Tiecheng for the Japanese Dentsu News Agency. The original manuscript was translated into Japanese and published in the agency's newly built memorial special issue (Special Issue on the Pacific Ocean Problem). It is a sincere and earnest admonition to the Japanese nation and a significant work in the international community. We have obtained the original manuscript from Mr. Wu and are publishing it for our readers.</p>
<p>— Editor's Note</p>
<p>[The alliance and friendship between China and Japan can guarantee peace in the Eastern Hemisphere.] The development of the mainland is China's responsibility. [In the future, I only hope that we trust each other... to solve the Indian problem. Once the Indian problem is solved, all colored people in the world will be able to revive. Japan should not worry about not having immigration and trade destinations after this achievement. It should never make the foolish strategy of invading China.] [Absolute guarantee of the mainland, and the full development in the United States and Australia is the right path for the survival and development of the Japanese nation.]</p>
<p>These are the heartfelt words of Japanese Gui Taro to the Chinese revolutionary leader, Mr. Sun Yat-sen (see Dai Jitao's *On Japan*, page 97).</p>
<p>Gui Taro was the most powerful and far-sighted military and politician in Japan. He formed a cabinet three times, serving for almost eight years. Since Japan has had a cabinet system, no one has served as prime minister for so long. When Gui was in office, he first allied Japan, a small emerging country, with the world's most powerful empire (Great Britain), causing Britain to abandon its century-old policy of glorious isolation, both to enhance its international status and to strengthen its national defense. Then, he defeated the world's largest continental empire (Russia), sweeping away the psychology of the world's powers despising Eastern nations and arousing a new wave of world national revolution. Since the Meiji Restoration in Japan, no one has been able to establish such amazing achievements for his country. Gui's loyalty to the country, the greatness of his vision, the excellence of his knowledge, and the brilliance of his achievements all led him to say these words. He naturally had extraordinary insights and indelible truths. When the Japanese people recall the martyrs and remember the legacy, they should reflect on what the national policy should be today.</p>
<p>In all fairness, the rise of the Japanese nation is indeed a unique feature of modern history, and the spirit of its people's struggle, sacrifice, integrity, and responsibility for the country and society is something that our Chinese nation cannot match. Chinese and Japanese cultures are thousands of years apart. When Chinese culture was in its golden age, the Japanese people were still in the primitive state of cave dwelling. However, due to the development of their national ambition and the power of assimilation, they first integrated various material and spiritual civilizations imported from Korea, China, and India to meet the needs of their lives, established the foundation of their national culture, and completed the organization of their national society. Then, they embraced the new era of European and Western forces invading the East, accepted European and Western science and culture, and created the foundation of their strength today, gaining an advanced position among the Eastern nations. Looking at modern history, there has never been a nation that has developed as quickly as the Japanese nation. If the Japanese nation can base its development on its ambition and strive to develop along the path of coexistence and co-prosperity for mankind, then its contribution to human culture will be immeasurable.</p>
<p>Examining the driving force behind the historical development of the Japanese nation, one cannot but trace back to the achievements of the Tokugawa era. The Tokugawa era was the heyday of the development of Chinese philosophical thought in Japan. The reason why the Japanese nation was able to break away from the barbaric state of tribal struggle, promote the development of its civil rights, unify its political organization, and even establish the foundation of its modern nation cannot but be attributed to the Chinese philosophical ideas of "benevolence" and "great unity." Those who talk about the Meiji Restoration in Japan often overlook this historical relationship, and the Japanese people also seem unable to recognize the foundation of their national cultural development, so that the orthodoxy of this culture is gradually suppressed by Japan's traditional theocratic historical theory and narrow-minded national psychology, and eventually despise China, blindly follow Europe and the United States, are greedy and insatiable, kill each other, and are obsessed with medieval militarism, thinking that the business of the world is only about force. In fact, they are trapped in the last fate of imperialists. Today's Japanese politicians generally lack far-sighted plans and superb insights. They often have no time to consider the future of the world, the future of the Eastern nations, and how China and Japan can coexist and co-prosper. They also fail to recognize where the true path of the Japanese nation lies. All day long, they are anxious and afraid, thinking that China's unification, China's liberation, and China's self-strengthening will hinder Japan's development and hinder the life of the empire. Therefore, [on the one hand, they loudly tell the world that China is not unified, and on the other hand, they insist on pursuing their policy of obstructing China's unification] (as stated in Gu Weijun's speech at the League of Nations). They do not think that the Chinese nation follows its spirit of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, justice, peace, and royal culture, treating others generously and practicing good faith and harmony. For thousands of years, although it has been the only great power in East Asia, it has never invaded land or destroyed any nation. It is the greatest guarantee of peace in East Asia. The Tokyo General Staff Headquarters and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs do not lack brilliant talents, but unfortunately, they are all blinded by subjective prejudices and misled by current interests, so they specialize in the inferior strategy of invading China. They do not know that China's development [can guarantee the alliance and friendship between China and Japan and can guarantee peace in East Asia] (as stated by Japan's Gui Taro). This is not only China's misfortune, but it will also bring infinite disaster to the Japanese nation.</p>
<p>Japan proclaims to the world that the reason why the Japanese have no choice but to invade Manchuria is that it is their lifeline, which can solve their economic problems. We will temporarily abandon all feelings of resentment and any political issues, and focus on studying the facts and establishing economic arguments. We will also see that the Japanese people's views are fallacious. Common people think that Manchuria, whether directly or indirectly, can solve Japan's population problem. Those who are not familiar with Manchuria's economic situation think that Manchuria is the direct outlet for Japan's huge annual population increase. Or they think that although Manchuria cannot absorb many Japanese people, it can also promote Japan's further industrialization and maintain a larger population. Manchuria can supply Japan with a lot of food and raw materials, and at the same time, it is also a market for its surplus goods. This kind of thinking has penetrated into the minds of the general public, but what is the reality? We should calm down and conduct objective research on the facts. First, from the perspective of the population problem, the Japanese people are not accustomed to large-scale immigration. Second, the Japanese people's living standards are higher, and they cannot compete with the local Chinese people on a large scale. Next, from the perspective of trade, in the years before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese dispute, Japan's exports to Manchuria only accounted for more than 8% of its total exports, and its imports from Manchuria accounted for about 70% of its total imports. Therefore, in reality, Japan's largest customers and suppliers are not Manchuria. Furthermore, although Manchuria is very rich in agricultural and mineral products, it has no important relationship with the lives of the Japanese people. The only most important agricultural product that Japan imports from Manchuria has always been soybeans. However, soybeans are mainly used as fertilizer. Japanese people have recently become more fond of chemical fertilizers, so the demand for soybeans will inevitably decrease. As for corn, sorghum, and other grains, the import has not been very large. Although rice is Japan's only important food, Manchuria produces very little rice. Cotton is unable to obtain high profits due to its poor quality. According to Japanese expert surveys, wool needs to be improved for 30 years before it can be supplied to the Japanese people. In terms of mineral products, Japan produces a lot of coal and can supply itself with a surplus. Geologists and mineral experts believe that Manchuria's known iron ore is unsuitable for supplying effective large-scale steel mills due to its low iron content. Japan's iron production is very fast, and its headquarters only consumes one-tenth of its iron production. Wood only accounts for 1% of its total imports and is not needed by Japan. All these arguments are based on the objective research results of modern economics authority Dr. B. Dorfman (Professor at the University of California, USA). Following this objective and scientific argument, we can know that [Manchuria is the lifeline of the Japanese nation] and that [Manchuria can solve Japan's economic problems] are inconsistent with the facts and are only excuses for Japanese ambitious warlords to use force and deceptive terms for Japanese political bureaucrats to deceive the world. It can be seen that Manchuria is not Japan's lifeline. The Japanese invasion of Manchuria is actually the most unprofitable inferior strategy.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese people chanted scorched-earth diplomacy and invaded China, the financial, financial, shipping, factories, commerce, and society have been greatly affected internally, and the international status has continued to decline and the diplomatic front has become increasingly isolated externally (Note). Although the European and American powers were constrained by the economy and could not impose military sanctions, the economic war has been urgently launched, such as India's increase in tariffs and South Africa's restrictions on imports. As for the increase in the construction of warships by various countries, the vertical and horizontal blades all implicitly indicate that the tragic disaster of the world will break out soon. However, the crisis of the Japanese nation is not starting today. After the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese people flapped their wings and crowed, celebrating the development of their national fortune. They did not know that they would be attacked from both sides and could not rest easy. When the European War broke out, the Japanese once again greatly benefited from the fisherman's profit. However, after the Washington Conference, the songs of Chu rose up on all sides, and the diplomatic front became increasingly dangerous. Following this historical lesson and reasoning, it can be seen that success and failure are two sides of the same coin, not absolute nouns. There is a Chinese proverb that says [If the old man on the border loses his horse, how do you know it is not a blessing]. However, the Japanese people's wisdom is not enough to understand this. They must forcibly swallow and plunder, causing themselves suffering. They think that China is weak and backward and must be conquered by force. However, from a historical point of view, since the cession of Taiwan, Japan has still spent more than ten years and countless military and financial resources to quell the resistance of the aborigines, who are less than three million and have no culture or history, and still failed to convince them. Furthermore, from the current world situation, since the League of Nations Covenant and the Kellogg-Briand Pact were signed, most observers believe that the above two covenants are nothing less than a major revolution in human thought, rather than the result of any accidental impulse or unconscious emotion. If we go back to the source, the two covenants are products of the needs of the times and a manifestation of a kind of self-consciousness. If mankind does not take a new step, modern civilization will be sentenced to death and be on the verge of death. Under the current organization of the world, it is absolutely impossible to continue to recognize cruel wars, along with their increasing destructive power, as a normal tool to benefit human life… In this whole world, regardless of East, West, South, or North, war should be illegal. War should no longer be the source of rights. War should no longer be the principle from which national obligations, rights, and actions arise.]</p>
<p>(Stimson's Kellogg-Briand Pact speech) Therefore, Japan's current national policy is not only inconsistent with the principles shown by its history, but also contrary to the trend of modern world evolution. If it still relies on its reckless courage and does not wake up early, it will inevitably fall into a fork in the road in the principle of human evolution, and the misfortune of the Japanese nation will be even more unbearable to imagine.</p>
<p>(Note) (Mori Kaku, a fierce general of the Seiyukai, questioned Uchida in the parliament and said that since the recognition of the Manchurian State has been decided, Japan must have the determination to break the boat and go to it. We should be aware that international relations, especially the relations between the United States, Japan, China, and Japan, will be worse than before. The government has some views on how to deal with the changes in the international situation and how to develop Japan's position in the international economic community as a result of the recognition (of the Manchurian State). As a result of the recognition (of the Manchurian State), has the government also prepared to deal with the drastic changes in national relations that will occur between China, the United States, Japan, and other countries? (See Hideo Nomura's "The Circumstances of Foreign Minister Hirota's Inauguration" in the October issue of *Chuo Koron*)</p>
<p>[China and Japan are the largest nations in East Asia. China and Japan are the driving forces behind the national independence movement in Asia.</p>
<p>[Europeans use military force and culture to oppress us Asians, so we Asians cannot progress. This kind of culture that uses military force to oppress people is called hegemony in our Chinese ancient language. Therefore, European culture is hegemonic culture. But we Orientals have always despised hegemonic culture. There is another kind of culture that is better than hegemonic culture. The essence of this culture is benevolence, justice, and morality. This kind of culture that uses benevolence, justice, and morality is to influence people, not to oppress people. It is to make people cherish virtue, not to make people grow in power. This kind of culture that makes people cherish virtue is called the royal way in our Chinese ancient language. Therefore, Asian culture is the royal way culture. Since the development of material civilization in Europe and the rise of hegemony, the morality of countries around the world has been declining every day. Even several countries in Asia have also declined a lot. Recently, European and American scholars who have paid a little attention to Oriental culture have gradually realized that although the material civilization of the Orient is not as good as that of the West, the morality of the Orient is much better than that of the West.</p>
<p>[In this world we are in now, what should we use as the foundation to create our Pan-Asianism? We should use our inherent culture as the foundation. We should talk about morality, benevolence, and justice. Benevolence, justice, and morality are the good foundations of our Pan-Asianism. With these good foundations, we also need to learn European science. Learning from Europe does not mean learning from Europe to eliminate other countries and oppress other nations.</p>
<p>[If we want to talk about Pan-Asianism, we want to restore the status of Asian nations. We can only unite the nations of various parts of Asia, with benevolence, justice, and morality as the foundation. The entire Asian nation will be very powerful.</p>
<p>[Your Japanese nation has obtained both the hegemonic culture of Europe and the United States and the essence of the royal way culture of Asia. From now on, whether you will be the dog of the Western hegemons or the guardian of the Eastern royal way for the future of world culture is up to you, the Japanese people, to carefully consider.]</p>
<p>This is the gist of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's speech on Pan-Asianism at the Kobe Higher Girls' School and five groups including the Kobe Chamber of Commerce on November 28, 1924. I still remember that when the speech was given, the Japanese people were so moved by Mr. Sun's sincerity that they were moved to tears. China and Japan are countries of the same language and the same race, brotherly countries. In terms of each other's relationship, the people of both countries should have joined hands and worked together to develop the future of both countries. However, since the Meiji Restoration in Japan, this slogan has never become a reality. Is this truly due to the incompatibility of the interests of the two countries, or is it due to the errors in the strategies of the Japanese authorities?</p>
<p>The media is the expression of social justice. The Dentsu News Agency has a long history of advocating public opinion. I am humiliated to solicit articles based on the motives of loving Japan, loving the Eastern nations, and loving the people of the world. I will use a frank and straightforward attitude to give my most sincere advice. There should be many insightful people in the Dentsu News Agency. I hope they will recognize the duties of the media and continue to fight for justice, point out the fork in the road for the Japanese nation, and jointly seek the path to co-prosperity between China and Japan. Japan is fortunate, China is fortunate, and mankind is fortunate.</p>
<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3>Reading Plan (II)</h3>
<p>Reply to Mr. He Yongquan and Inform Readers Who Have Obtained Registration Certificates from This Department</p>
<p>From the letters we have received from many readers registered with this department, we see that very few are actually discussing reading plans according to the procedures set by this department. Many readers simply don't pay attention or don't know how to start drafting a plan, yet they hope others will draft it for them. Some readers’ plans, at first glance, are obviously impractical, or are completely based on inexperienced fantasies, or are very carelessly made. However, a plan as seriously and concretely proposed by Mr. He Yongquan based on actual experience is not only a model reference for our readers but also reminds us of the direction in which we should help readers. Therefore, we have published Mr. He's original letter without any changes. Now, we will further discuss it with Mr. He and the general readership.</p>
<p>We completely agree with Mr. He's entire plan. Having a reading plan is like having a plan in life, which can determine a person's success or failure. Since ancient times, there have been many people who, despite being studious and working hard, have not achieved success. There have also been many who, despite seemingly spending little time, have achieved astonishing results. Especially in today's era where scientific methods have become a universal tool, if one is not economical, not only will one achieve nothing, but one will also have no way to start. Therefore, at the beginning of our research, this department wanted to correct readers' scattered attitudes and guide them onto an orderly path of reading life.</p>
<p>The first principle in drafting a [plan] is that it must be based on your actual needs and not just on your own fantasies. Secondly, it should not be empty talk written on paper, but something that can be implemented. Thirdly, the [plan] should consider the whole of what is to be learned, not just a certain part. This [plan] should be part of a whole plan for life, that is, it must have a future. After this part of the plan is completed, it must complete a certain stage, making your understanding more developed.</p>
<p>Therefore, establishing a plan is naturally not an easy task. You have to base it on your experience and level of understanding, and it is also necessary to present it for discussion. We welcome criticism from people with similar experiences.</p>
<p>The above are words of principle. Mr. He's plan has largely achieved this. The reason I am sparing no effort in speaking is because I hope that general readers will read Mr. He's letter based on these principles. At the same time, I also hope that Mr. He will review his own plan to see if it is completely suitable.</p>
<p>The research center proposed by Mr. He is very correct. But unfortunately, we do not know Mr. He's academic qualifications in detail. Based on the points raised by Mr. He and the steps on how to proceed, I dare say that he must have considerable knowledge of economics and the theory and application of materialistic dialectics. Without the former foundation, one cannot recognize the complex relationships of the capitalist economic structure and obtain its essence. The latter is a matter of methodology, and errors in methodology are the same danger. But the biggest difficulty is not the recognition of tools, but how to use them. This is a difficult problem that can trouble many experts. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Approved Special Education Funds for Jiangxi</h3>
<p>A Total of 120,000 Yuan Was Allocated from Post-War Reconstruction Funds</p>
<p>The Jiangxi Education Department previously received a telegram from the Provincial Government, relayed from Chairman Chiang, stating that education should be immediately administered in the recovered rural areas of the bandit-affected areas of this province. Therefore, the department drafted an outline of a special education plan for the recovered areas of Jiangxi and submitted it to the Provincial Government Meeting for discussion, resolution, and amendment. The plan budgeted 100,000 yuan to operate 300 people's schools distributed across the recovered counties. The raising of these funds was originally intended to request a subsidy of 120,000 yuan from the Xingying (Chairman's Headquarters) and 60,000 yuan from the Provincial Government to make up the large sum and start the project. As the request for subsidies still had to be submitted by the Provincial Government for review and approval, the implementation date of the Qibu (Plan) had to be slightly delayed. In order to expedite the process, the Education Department first allocated 30,000 yuan from the education fund to operate 53 people's schools distributed across 11 counties, including Yunhua, and is now actively preparing for the People's Education Teacher Training Institute. It is now known that the previous plan has been submitted by the Provincial Government and personally approved by Chairman Chiang, and the requested subsidy has also been approved and allocated from the post-war reconstruction funds (totaling 120,000 yuan). Therefore, there are now 150,000 yuan in special education funds, which can be fully implemented according to the original plan.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Will Add Specialists</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education has specially established the Northeast Youth Education Office to help Qingnian (Youth) from the northeast who are diligent, hardworking, and out of school, and has appointed Zhou Tianfang and Li Xien as directors and deputy directors. It is reported that the office will be located in the Ministry of Education. It is also reported that the Ministry of Education originally had five specialists. Since Cheng Qibao and Yang Kang took office as the heads of the Hubei and Anhui Education Departments, there have been two vacancies for specialists. It is reported that the Ministry of Education will appoint Zhou Tianfang and Li Xien as specialists.</p>
<h3>The Crisis of Higher Education in China (II) by Luo Jialun</h3>
<p>Thirdly, the feeling is that equipment is insufficient. The equipment in Chinese universities is mostly inadequate. To do a good job, one must first sharpen one's tools. Modern science, in particular, requires equipment. Equipment is an important tool for studying knowledge and an important encouragement for studying knowledge. People who run education should save any expenses to engage in equipment. The country should also do its best to subsidize school funding, designating it not for the expansion of administration but for the increase of equipment. China is a poor country. We must never, and should never, use equipment as decoration. Equipment should be aimed at practical research work. People who use equipment should also understand the difficulties of people's livelihoods and cherish and make full use of it. There are also some scholars in the West who have achieved good results in incomplete laboratories and then achieved less than before in magnificent laboratories. However, from the country's standpoint, if you don't want to run a university, if you want to run a university, you should get his equipment right. Also, because there are too many overlapping departments and departments in universities that have not been sorted out, there is too much of the same elementary equipment, and the advanced equipment is too little due to economic dispersion, which is also very regrettable.</p>
<p>Fourthly, there are difficulties in recruiting teachers. This may also be because there are too many universities. The number of universities in China, according to the population ratio, is certainly not too many, but in terms of hiring teachers, there are really not enough scholars in China to allocate because although there are some people who are willing to dedicate their lives to academic research, they are not many. This phenomenon is not only true in China, but also in China, the government and schools are grabbing people, and schools and schools are grabbing people, so there is even more panic about talents. Now, no matter how efficient the government is, the number of students studying abroad and university graduates is indeed unprecedented. Because the school's funding is more difficult, the treatment of professors is not as good as that of government personnel. For example, the treatment of ordinary university professors is mostly no more than three or four hundred yuan, while government officials can be as high as four hundred yuan, and senior officials can be as high as six or seven hundred yuan. Therefore, it is better to work as a technician or section chief in the government than as a professor in a university. If the treatment of university professors cannot be raised to a considerable limit, it may be difficult for everyone to settle down and study knowledge.</p>
<p>According to what I said above, it seems that Chinese universities are difficult to run, but this is not entirely the case. As long as we understand that to settle and have a whole plan and determination to go for it, it is possible to make a radical improvement. There are several reasons why universities are not doing well. Some are from the universities themselves, which they should naturally work hard to improve. Some are from outside the universities, which naturally require the cooperation of all parties. First, basic education should be properly managed, especially middle schools, because it is really difficult to remedy a bad foundation. The government should also strictly examine all public and private middle schools. After the implementation of the unified entrance examination last year, the results of the university entrance examination have been better. This is also a very clear evidence. At the same time, universities should also strictly select new students for admission because university education is not universal education. Even the Soviet Union's education plan only heard that they were striving to create tens of thousands of industrial and technical talents, and did not hear that they were expanding the number of university students by tens of thousands. It can be seen that universities should focus on quality, not quantity. One person with good quality can be worth several people. Now the United States and Japan both feel that there are too many university students. Although the number of university students in China cannot be said to be large, the ratio of university graduates and their unemployment is very large. There are many graduates that society simply cannot accommodate, especially those who graduate from the Faculty of Law. Therefore, I advocate that the first step is to run middle schools strictly, and the second step is to strictly examine and enroll new students in universities. The average cost of each university student to the country each year is about 1,000 yuan or more. These are all the hard-earned money of the people and the burden of the people across the country. Therefore, if the country does not want to train talents, then it is already done. Otherwise, it must ensure that the talents trained are all energetic and useful. Otherwise, students will be unemployed after graduation. Isn't it terrible to be unemployed immediately after graduation? The unrest in politics and society in recent years has all started from this. The current situation of social disorder makes students feel afraid at a glance before graduating. Therefore, they think of various ways to show off in school, and some are willing to be used by others. The future is one of the important reasons. Even the criticism of the head of the department and the professor is not based on their knowledge, but on whether they can find a way out for themselves in the future. Although this is an exception and not entirely the case, it can already make the future of academia pessimistic.</p>
<p>In the past, Zeng Guofan talked about three things to pay attention to when employing people: (1) the way of transferring; (2) the way of cultivating; and (3) the method of examination. Only after the above three points can a true talent be trained. At most, the current schools only do a part of the work of transferring and cultivating. Further cultivation and examination lie in the youth after they take office. In a chaotic society, regardless of the individual's personality and knowledge, only their background, who introduced them, and what power they have are asked. Such a social organization is really extremely dangerous. The use of people is naturally not limited to the government. General society can also accommodate many talents. Therefore, not only must the general national undertakings be developed, but also the general social undertakings must be developed in order to solve the problem of the way out for university graduates. For example, most university graduates in the United States are unwilling to go into politics, because there are many opportunities for development in industry and commerce, and the prospects are better. Why should everyone squeeze into the government to grab food? For example, Ford alone has tens of thousands of people in his company. Every major city in the world has his branch offices and offices, which are more magnificent than embassies and consulates. He is like a lifelong small duke. Why must he be the president? But in China, it is not the case. Various undertakings in China are too undeveloped, while government offices are very developed. Moreover, there are many officials in many government offices, with less work and higher remuneration. Therefore, after being educated, most people are unwilling to go to the countryside and are willing to concentrate in the city. They clearly know that unemployment is very painful, but they are willing to wait for unemployment. They clearly know that the profession is unstable, but it is better to be comfortable for a day. In this situation, not only is politics unstable, but social morality is also declining day by day. If various industrial and commercial enterprises develop together, and their desired treatment is better than that of government offices, then young people will naturally look at the scenery and follow it, their energy will be vented, and their ambition can also be developed. Even those with a desire for leadership can know to take this opportunity to exert it. There is no need for everyone to squeeze into the political arena. You climb on my back, and I climb on your back, and as a result, we all fall into the deep pit and die together. As for the fact that new businesses can absorb most of the talents, it is obvious. For example, the newly opened Hangjiang Railway can prove that Mr. Zeng Yangfu and I said that the Hangjiang Railway employs about 400 university graduates from home and abroad. Please see that a 630-kilometer light rail can already accommodate so many people. Then, there is no need to say more about other larger-scale businesses. In the past one or two years, there has been a notable phenomenon: graduates from the three disciplines of agriculture, engineering, and science in universities have better career prospects, while graduates from the departments of political science, economics, and law feel particularly difficult to find jobs. Therefore, in the past few years, there has also been a change in the trend of young people going to school. More people are applying for the three disciplines of science, agriculture, and engineering than those who are applying for the liberal arts. This phenomenon exists in universities in the north, and it also exists in universities in the south. This is a healthy sign. This is still because the government has recently established farms in the east, farms in the west, built roads in the south, and built roads in the north. The government is always limited. If various social undertakings develop together, the future will be even more promising. The Jiangsu Education Department ordered the distribution to various counties</p>
<h3>Method of Compiling Elementary School Local Teaching Materials</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Education Department ordered the education bureaus of various counties, stating that national education is the key to saving the country, and to make the people have a concept of loving the nation, we must first enable them to understand the local area where the nation lives. Elementary school is the foundation of all education. If children can know the excellent customs, rich products, and past role models and historical sites of their native homeland in their daily training, they will be able to arouse the heart of loving the homeland, which will also be able to cultivate the ambition of loving the nation in the future. Therefore, to vigorously promote the promotion of national education, the teaching of each subject in elementary schools must try to adopt local teaching materials as much as possible so that children can fully recognize the value of their local homeland, and then extend to the purpose of loving the nation. The education department previously ordered the organization of a collection committee to collect as much as possible as supplementary teaching materials. This has been ordered to be followed and is on file. Now, in order to improve efficiency and enhance it, nine articles have been specially formulated for the method of compiling elementary school local teaching materials in various counties of Jiangsu. In addition to reporting to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for record, the relevant methods are hereby issued. The head of the bureau should immediately comply with it and, within one week of the arrival of the document, organize the compilation committee and report it to the hall for record. He should also engage in collection in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 of the method and start to draft the main points of the annual teaching materials for each subject and submit them to the hall for review and approval within the time limit. The teaching materials collected in the previous order can be handled together. This matter is related to the key to national education and political affairs. The head of the bureau must deeply understand the hall's long-term attention and strive to comply with it. Do not be negligent or added Han Zhitieqie.</p>
<p>▲Measures for Compiling Local Teaching Materials for Primary Schools in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province</p>
<p>Article 1: The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education has formulated these measures in order to arouse children's awareness of loving their homeland, so as to promote the spirit of the nation and support the people's livelihood. Article 2: The education bureaus of each county, or the county governments of counties that have been abolished, should compile local teaching materials for each subject in elementary school in accordance with the objectives described in the preceding article. Article 3: The content of the local teaching materials for each subject in elementary school compiled by each county should be divided into the following three parts: A. About the past: such as the county's past history, celebrity stories, evolution, historical sites, etc. B. About the present: such as the county's geography, products, customs, habits, economy, places of interest, etc. C. About the future: such as developing the local economy, supporting the people's livelihood, promoting the advantages, correcting the shortcomings, etc. Article 4: Each county should establish a local teaching material compilation committee for elementary schools to compile local teaching materials for elementary schools. The number of committee members should be five to nine. The Education Bureau or the county government that has been abolished will hire people who are familiar with local conditions and who are knowledgeable about elementary school teaching methods to organize it. In counties with provincial-level experimental primary schools or affiliated primary schools, the principal or teachers should be hired as committee members. After the committee is established, the organization charter and the list of committee members should be reported to the hall for record. Article 5: After the local teaching material compilation committee for elementary schools in each county is established, it should collect reference materials in accordance with the principles of each item in Article 3 within one month, and compile the main points of the annual teaching materials for each subject in accordance with the standards of the elementary school curriculum and the important items of each subject operation, and submit them to the hall for review and record. Article 6: After the main points of the teaching materials in the preceding article have been reviewed and filed by the Education Department, the committee should immediately start compiling specific teaching materials, and complete the compilation within three months and submit them to the hall for review, approval, and promulgation as supplementary teaching materials. Article 7: Except for those who have submitted a request to the Education Department for approval due to special circumstances, the Education Bureau or the county government that has been abolished in each county should comply with the compilation within the time limit. If the time limit is exceeded, the county head will be held responsible for the failure to supervise, and should be reprimanded. The head of the bureau or the third section chief of each county that has been abolished will be held responsible for the failure to implement, and should be recorded as a demerit to show punishment. Article 8: The county-run experimental elementary schools in each county should be ordered by the Education Bureau or the county government that has been abolished to bear more compilation responsibilities.

<h3>Zhu Jiahua Praises Contemporary Chinese for Middle Schools</h3>
<p>Since its publication, Contemporary Chinese for Middle Schools, edited and printed by the Shanghai Middle School Bookstore, has been widely ordered by middle schools in various regions.

The book is entirely based on the Chinese language curriculum syllabus issued by the Education Department, and includes annotations, grammar, and biographical sketches of the authors. All required readings and recommended readings are clearly marked. Its editing method is novel and complete, and it is rare among Chinese textbooks in the country. Therefore, Cai Yuanzeng, Chen Bulei, Zhou Fohai, and other gentlemen have long praised and commended it. Former Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua has also strongly praised these books recently, stating briefly that Chinese language teaching materials for middle schools must be suitable for the political and social environment of the country, and special emphasis should be placed on the promotion and stimulation of the inherent morality of the nation, with the revival of the nation as the main purpose.

<p>Tianjin Port Football Team</p>
<h3>Not as Strong as Last Year</h3>
<p>Departing South on February 10</p>
<p>Tianjin News: The Tianjin-Shanghai Port Football Tournament will be held in Shanghai. After the Tianjin Port representative team was selected, there have been two selection matches. The formal lineup has been largely determined. In addition to arranging practice matches with strong teams from Pingjin in the near future, the entire team is scheduled to depart for Shanghai on February 10. According to a member of the team, it is feared that the team will have difficulty achieving satisfactory results on this trip. Recalling the previous campaign, there were no restrictions on the selection of team members, so it was possible to overcome strong enemies and relieve the Tianjin people. This year, it has been decided that the members of the soldiers' representatives team cannot exceed three per team. Although the Tianjin team's forwards are good, the defenders are quite weak. Because of this restriction, it is really difficult to select suitable talent. With such a team, how can it not be ominous and less auspicious to fight against strong enemies in Shanghai? As for the Hong Kong-Shanghai battle, because there is also this restriction, it is feared that it will be difficult for the Hong Kong team to develop.</p>
<p>Also, the Tianjin Port representative team will mobilize to the south on February 10. Recently, the Tianjin Football Association has planned to arrange friendly matches with various Zhang troupes in order to provide the team with more practice opportunities and raise travel expenses. Yesterday, a letter was specially sent inviting the Beiping Fuda team, which had recently defeated the Tianjin French Public School and Western merchants, to Tianjin to perform. It should be possible to realize this in the near future. The association has tentatively planned the schedule as follows: February 3, Fu Ren vs. Western Merchants Team; February 4, Fu Ren vs. Representative Team.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Education's Sports Committee Will Hold a Meeting</h3>
<p>▲ Cheng Dengke Has a Proposal</p>
<p>(Beijing News) The Ministry of Education convened the Editorial Committee for the Syllabus of Physical Education Professors in Primary and Secondary Schools this time. The methods for compiling junior high school physical education textbooks have already been decided, and Wu Yunrui and Song Junfu have been recommended to be responsible for their completion, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. The methods for compiling senior high school and primary school textbooks are roughly the same as those listed for junior high school, with no major differences. The compilation of physical education textbooks is limited to the primary and secondary school parts because physical education must start from the root and establish a foundation in primary school before adding appropriate training in middle school to make physical and mental development sound and achieve the goal of revitalizing the nation. Primary and secondary schools are the most common. Once you get to university, you have the ability to choose, and the physical education progress of universities with convenient transportation has almost reached its peak, while the physical education of inland universities is very different. Therefore, it is difficult to set a standard for university physical education textbooks. However, the physical education professors in universities should choose teaching materials that are suitable for the local conditions.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education's Sports Committee is scheduled to meet at the Ministry of Education on the 25th of this month. This time, the proposals are more concrete and specific. Committee member Cheng Dengke and others also have proposals that will be sent to the meeting before the meeting.</p>

<h3>Vocational Education Report</h3>
<p>(10)</p>
<p>(C) Advanced Vocational Training</p>
<p>France's advanced vocational schools are the National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts, with a total of six branches located in Aix-en-Provence, Angers, Châlons-sur-Marne, Cluny, Lille, and Paris. The earliest was established in 1776. The National School of Engineering in Strasbourg is also a school of equal standing.</p>
<p>The curriculum of the National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts aims to cultivate engineering personnel and chief engineers. The course lasts for three years, with annual examinations to determine student advancement. Admission requires excellent examination results, with most students coming from national vocational schools or practical schools and secondary schools with higher testing standards. The annual intake of new students is limited to one hundred. The curriculum of the National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts places a strong emphasis on workshop training, with at least five hours of daily workshop practice and only two hours of drafting and engineering subjects, which is its distinctive feature. Graduates have sufficient practical knowledge and are welcomed and employed by the industry.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Arts and Crafts and the Arts and Crafts Normal School also belong to advanced vocational education institutions. The former is a place for researching arts and crafts academics, while the latter is a vocational normal school, a place for training teachers for practical schools.</p>
<p>(3) Private Vocational Schools</p>
<p>The classification of technical personnel at all levels is very detailed and the scope is broad. Therefore, the responsibility for training and education is very heavy. It is difficult for the government to take care of everything, so it has to rely on private forces for assistance. As mentioned earlier, French private vocational schools also have unique features. The government provides subsidies based on their performance to encourage and supervise them. Private vocational schools are also divided into three categories:</p>
<p>(A) Arts Training</p>
<p>Practical industry leaders with far-sighted vision recognize the importance of vocational training for national social economy. Some have established schools within factories to train apprentices, or jointly organized schools by associations and public groups, such as railway bureaus and automobile manufacturers associations, all of which have long been established. Employer associations and labor groups have established technical classes for apprentices in various industries to study. These technical classes are increasing daily, and those with excellent results can also receive government subsidies, with a maximum limit of 50% of recurring expenses, while also being subject to government supervision.</p>
<p>(B) Intermediate Vocational Training</p>
<p>Intermediate vocational training schools or training classes established by private individuals are mostly organized by industrial and commercial associations, similar to apprentice training.</p>
<p>(C) Advanced Vocational Training</p>
<p>Private advanced vocational schools include: (1) The Central School of Arts and Manufactures, which has been established for a century and focuses on training engineering personnel; (2) The Higher School of Commerce, mostly established by local chambers of commerce. (Technical colleges and vocational colleges include private ones and those affiliated with universities). The training of senior engineering personnel is generally divided into two parts. The Central School of Arts and Manufactures and the National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts provide the first part of training, focusing on general engineering knowledge, with a course length of three years. Each vocational college then provides the second part, focusing on specialized knowledge. However, vocational colleges also offer both parts of the curriculum. Famous private vocational schools include the Higher School of Foundry in Paris, the Leather School in Lyon, the Ron Chemical Institute, the Mulo Higher Textile School, the Optical Institute of Paris, the Higher School of Electrical Engineering, and the Higher School of Aeronautics. Those affiliated with universities include the Department of Electrical Engineering, Metallurgy, and Brewing at Nancy University, and the Department of Electrical Engineering and Papermaking at Grenoble University, and the Department of Electrical Engineering and Chemical Engineering at Lille University. Private vocational colleges or schools that have been investigated and confirmed and certified by the Higher Vocational Education Committee as having excellent performance are awarded annual subsidies by the Vocational Education Department of the Ministry of Education to encourage them.</p>
<p>(4) French Agricultural Education</p>
<p>Since the French Revolution, the government has begun planning agricultural education. In 1848, it was stipulated that each province should have one agricultural school, and each district should have one agricultural college and one agricultural normal school. In 1879, it was stipulated that each province and city should appoint agricultural teachers to be responsible for agricultural education in the province and city. In 1912, it was further stipulated that each province should have one agricultural instructor to specialize in the popularization of agricultural knowledge, such as school agricultural courses, agricultural extension classes, and agricultural experimental farms (excluding veterinary and forestry farms), all of which are under their jurisdiction. Each province appoints one or more agricultural lecturers to assist the instructors in compiling lectures and conducting agricultural lectures to impart knowledge to the general public, and their effectiveness is quite significant.</p>
<p>However, the decree of August 1918 stipulated that in addition to agricultural schools, agricultural extension classes, agricultural mobile classes, and winter agricultural schools must also be established specifically to provide rural youth and farm workers with the opportunity to enroll, which will have greater and more far-reaching effects. Therefore, according to the current system, the promotion of agricultural education includes the following levels of schools and training classes: (1) National Institute of Agronomy (Paris); (2) National Agricultural School; (3) Agricultural School; (4) Winter Agricultural School; (5) Agricultural Extension Classes and Mobile Classes.</p>
<p>National Institute of Agronomy (Paris): This institute is the most advanced school of general agricultural education. Graduates of secondary schools must pass the entrance examination to be admitted. Each year, it recruits about 100 new students, while the number of applicants is often more than 500. There are about 40 teachers, all of whom have passed the examination and are appointed by the government. The course lasts for two years. Those who wish to further their studies may enter the River Engineering and Forestry School in Nancy or the Agricultural Training Department established by the Ministry of Agriculture to prepare to be agricultural or horticultural teachers, or to receive training for agricultural and farm workers and managers, or the Department of Physical Chemistry and Natural Sciences to study scientific applications to agriculture. The Cooperative Department provides training for union insurance, lending, and agricultural cooperative managers. The institute has a special department of milk engineering to study milk, oil, and cheese production. After students complete theoretical studies at school, they must go to milk and oil factories across the country for inspection to gain practical experience.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Fragmenting the Whole and Integrating the Parts</h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>I threw a piece of snow-white silver dollar, weighing exactly seven mace, one fen, and five li, onto the counter of a tobacco shop and exchanged it for six double dimes and ten copper coins. This is fragmenting the whole into parts. Logically, matter is indestructible. If a silver dollar can be fragmented into silver dimes and copper coins, then having six double dimes and ten copper coins should naturally allow them to be integrated into a whole, making a silver dollar. However, in reality, it's not like that. Fragmenting the whole into parts is not a problem, but if you want to integrate the parts into a whole, then you have to dig out three or five more copper coins from your pocket in addition to the six double dimes and ten copper coins. Otherwise, you can forget about integrating the parts into a whole and exchanging them for a silver dollar.</p>
<p>The above example of fragmenting the whole, as long as you are willing to dig into your pocket, subsidize the difference, and suffer a small loss, you can still achieve the point of integrating the parts into a whole, without being completely hopeless. However, we should understand that the seriousness of fragmenting the whole is not just this. Let's take another example. For example, a whole bolt of fabric can be used to make three pieces of clothing. This is also a type of fragmenting the whole. And the parts that are fragmented under this formula of fragmenting the whole will forever be parts, and there will no longer be the possibility of integrating the parts into a whole.</p>
<p>Over the past year or two, the four words "fragmenting the whole into parts" have often been seen in the reports of our Northeast Volunteer Army, and everyone loves to follow it up with the sentence "Wait for an opportunity to integrate the parts into a whole."</p>
<p>The words are indeed spoken lightly and calmly, and are grand and high-sounding, but once a bolt of cloth is cut into two pieces, it can never become a whole bolt again. Even if we take a step back and say that six double dimes and ten copper coins, plus some additional subsidies, can still barely integrate the parts into a whole and become a silver dollar, but in reality, six double dimes and ten copper coins are only worth ninety-eight cents. If a snow-white silver dollar is fragmented into parts and then the parts are integrated back into a whole like this, wouldn't it be finished?</p>
<p>This is indeed a problem full of mystery.</p>
<h3>On the Terms of Address Between Two Surnames</h3>
<p>— Chen Tao</p>
<p>This article is all about male and female friends. I don't know when I saw an article on titles in this publication. It said that the most common terms of address in the opposite sex are "Mr." and "Ms.", and they gradually change to "Older Brother" and "Younger Sister." (Roughly that's the meaning; I've forgotten the original.) Actually, the terms of address in the opposite sex are really complicated; the first time, the most common term is "Ms.," just like "Mr." However, in addressing a man, you can change to "Brother XX" the second or third time. Going a step further, it's okay to write just one name. There's not much difference in the content of the letter or the friendship. Calling someone "Brother" or using their name doesn't necessarily mean that the two people are in love to a certain degree. However, for women, it still seems a bit impossible, still a bit inconvenient: after calling someone "Ms." the first time, the second time it's not possible to immediately follow with "Older Sister X," "Younger Sister X," or just one name. If you mechanically write like that, people (the other person) must think you're mentally ill, right?</p>
<p>The terms of address are probably more special for Westerners; they or their (sic) first letters to people call people "My dear!" or "Dear..." and refer to themselves as "Your..." I want to try to use that with newly acquainted Chinese friends of the opposite sex, writing something like "My dear..." or "Dear..." and referring to oneself as "Yours..." Then people are definitely going to think you're a horny madman or a pervert.</p>
<p>There seems to be a barrier in the middle, I feel.</p>
<p>"How could there be a barrier..." a friend of mine once argued with me like this: "Chinese people (especially young men and women now) are the best at using terms of address. He or she evolves step by step. The first time you don't necessarily have to use 'Ms.' or 'Mr.' if you already know them. Afterward, the man usually changes it first and at the same time asks the other person to change it too (there are really a lot of tricks: what 'beautiful little bird,' 'lovely rose'; 'great tiger' will also be produced in the same way. [My dearest...][You in the bottom of my heart][The person in my dreams][You who cannot be forgotten] these kinds of nauseating words aren't used much now. Now the most popular thing is just to use the name. What's even more intimate is to use one word. For example, if her name is [Tairy], then you can just write the word [Li]. This is much better than calling her Dear Darling!"</p>
<p>Of course, this also changes with their feelings. Otherwise, you might as well keep calling Ms. all the way, and if you try to change it up and call her some kind of [little bird][rose], she won't pay any attention to you," he added, seemingly having experienced it himself.</p>
<p>Haha... Terms of address have also evolved. It seems like it's a kind of tool for expressing feelings, modern young people! Isn't it?</p>
<h3>Year-End Sentiments</h3>
<p>— Jian Xin</p>
<p>How can I bear the desolation in my heart? The splendid years are half-worn away. Endless grievances are hard to repay. Limited fame burdens me more and more. I pity Yi for his peaceful simplicity. I am ashamed of my wasted plans for a big catch. Heartbroken, I want to bow in the deep boudoir. The aged Fan Ying sheds tears.</p>
<p>How many cold eyes of people have turned back? The gains and losses are just a pellet. Slander and praise encroach on each other, increasing love and strangeness. Sins and faults cluster together, making it hard to laugh or cry. Since ancient times, entering the world has been worrying about holding a jade. I judge myself to have mistakenly planted a gate at the entrance. I am used to the wind and waves of the lakes and seas. The solitary tumbleweed has long been tied to the carved railing.</p>
<p>Vaguly searching for the past, my heart is lost. The silver pond and the green moon are even more entangled. I occasionally contemplate Zen principles with three thousand verses. I also write one or two poems for the boudoir. The swan's footprints are aimlessly left behind. The clouds and mud ultimately divide people and heaven. I remember that since I put down my pen during the yellow flower season. How many years have passed since I kicked across the autumn river?</p>
<h3>A Quiet Observation of the [Exhibition]</h3>
<p>In Shanghai, the [big sales] on the market are constant throughout the year. Following the beginning of each solar term, there is a new name to hold a bargain: the newspapers are constantly publishing these kinds of advertisements: all kinds of flags are hung in the streets, flying in the wind. When you go to the streets in your spare time, everything you see and hear is lively, brilliant, and splendid, making you dizzy and fascinated. But what is the meaning of these scenes? People who know a little about the social situation will tell you: this kind of vigorous cheap selling is a symbol of social and economic decline.</p>
<p>The anarchy of all production, this is the characteristic of capitalist society; overproduction, naturally, one must try every means to find a way out. And in this ruthless and acute competition, it is not difficult for us to imagine how many small-capital merchants, because they are squeezed out, encounter tragic fates.</p>
<p>In the past, many literary works have described this situation, such as the new writer Mao Dun's [Lin Family Shop], which is this kind of work. On the screen, this kind of work is really rare. Not long ago, Shanghai publicly screened an American film [Business]; in domestic films, we have only recently seen the only one [Exhibition].</p>
<p>[Exhibition] is a production of the Star Film Company. The story: is roughly very similar to [Lin Family Shop]. It depicts a grocery store in a small town, with an honest small businessman as the protagonist. The whole film unfolds the scene of commercial competition very tensely: the oppression and exploitation of feudal forces, the squeeze of competitors, the threat of the economy, and finally make his store close down, and the protagonist suffers the most tragic fate.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, this kind of exposure work has its special significance. We can recognize from the screen: what kind of society we are currently in.</p>

<h3>Fourth Battalion Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Episode Twenty-Three</p>
<p>The pain is unbearable, listen attentively to the music</p>
<p>The joy hasn't been exhausted, a hurried message arrives</p>
<p>He explained to himself, "There's no need to blame him. Probably Chinese people are always disgusted with soldiers. They've suffered from soldiers both directly and indirectly, so whenever soldiers are mentioned, everyone feels uncomfortable. Actually, Ji isn't dissatisfied with my son. Even those words he said. Not only shouldn't he scold my son, but he's been helped by my son and should be grateful to him. Why should I make myself angry because of these idle words? What's the point?" He walked into the house in a daze, not even closing the street door, lest he delay important matters. So, with his pipe in his mouth, he slowly walked to the front courtyard, planning to close the gate. At this time, he heard Jiang say, "There are footsteps in the courtyard. Is Little Lin closing the gate? The old master hasn't returned yet. I heard he went to West Mountain with Gan Er Ye." He also heard Guizhi say, "This old gentleman has such interests. Gan Er Ye is a completely new person. How can they talk together?" Jiang said, "In your eyes, you always think Gan Ji is good. Actually, he's nothing special. He's still poor and single. If it weren't for our son-in-law finding him this teaching job, he might still be starving." Guizhi's voice suddenly increased, and she replied, "Why do you slander people like that!" With just this sentence, the room became silent. Old Master Zhao thought, "This is strange. Our bride-to-be is actually helping Gan Ji." He didn't go to the front to close the gate. He quickly ran back to the inner courtyard, sat down on the chair, and slowly puffed on his pipe. The next day, he quietly went into the city and sent a telegram to Ziqiang, telling him to quickly return home and get married. He then invited relatives and friends to step up preparations for the wedding. Five days after the telegram was sent, Zhao Ziqiang carried a load of luggage and walked home. (296)</p>

<h3>Gold Market's Erratic Movements</h3>
<p>Unfavorable Overseas Telegrams Weaken Previous Market Sentiment</p>
<p>Sassoon Buying to Cover Short Positions Leads to Gradual Recovery</p>
<p>The gold market yesterday opened with many fluctuations, but the result was flat, and people's minds seemed uncertain. Overseas telegrams were slightly bad, and the previous market sentiment was weak. However, due to short covering, the subsequent market was still able to strengthen. In the early morning, the overseas silver market rose in British currency and shrunk in American currency. The forward silver price on the Gold Exchange fell by one li to one and a half li, but it rose quite a bit compared to the opening. Therefore, although exchange rates and prices fell uniformly, people's minds were difficult to stand firm on the bullish side. The opening was flat, and the situation became hesitant. Although the bank's buying briefly rose to 90 yuan after the opening, and Reuters reported that the US Senate Banking Committee proposed increasing the issuance of non-interest-bearing bonds, it still fell back, but the market was still flat. After the initial wandering, the Reuters telegrams continuously reported that the US Federal Bank, on behalf of the Department of Finance, continued to purchase gold at home and abroad, and that Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau had requested Congress to quickly pass the bill to reduce the gold content of the dollar. In addition, the Havas agency also claimed that the House of Representatives had passed the dollar devaluation bill, and people's hearts were tired. The gold market had a slight downward trend. The subsequent market continued to weaken, and Sassoon then came to buy, and the American dollar became popular. Reuters reported that the US Commercial Daily carried the news that the dollar would stabilize at five yuan (against the pound), although it had little impact, the colleagues short covering was particularly enthusiastic, and once broke through the 90 yuan level. The result was the same as the previous closing price, and the red price was one thousand and eighty-two yuan. The city situation will be recorded after one day.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 688.5 yuan, a slight setback of three corners compared to the previous closing. Goods opened at 8 yuan. The exchange market opened with a recent selling price of British exchange at one shilling and four pence. 4375 American exchange at 34 yuan. Yuan Mao Yonglian sold a lot and dropped to 7 yuan. Zhengjin Taiwan disk Zhuyouyou bought US dollars in May at 8125. Ruixing Yuanchun Hengyu Zhifeng Yongda Decheng and others took turns buying and rose to 90 yuan. The Reuters telegram had news of the US waste banknotes. Qian Changxiang Hongli sold to 87.5 yuan. Zhengjin Na May US dollars 8125. HSBC listed Xiaoying up 125 and the United States down 25. Hengtai Natiao pulled up more than one yuan, but because Yuanchang Yongqian Changxiang Hengxing Changsheng Yong and others came to sell, they returned to 7 yuan. The city Dacheng Daxing Yongyuan Maoyong came to enter the plate to buy US dollars in May 875. At this time, there was still a lot of struggle, and after entering, Zhaofeng Changqian Changxiang Yuan Maoyong and others took the opportunity to supply the road. The Reuters telegram came with the news of buying gold, and the downstream Hengyu Zhifeng Yongyi Dayong Hengxing Yuan and others continued to sell. The domestic market also hardened, and the noon closing fell to 683 yuan and 8 corners. Goods were auctioned at 3.5 yuan. After the market closed, Hengxing Yuan Yi Dayong and others still sold and retreated into the 3 yuan range.</p>
<p>The after-market opened at 682.9 yuan. Goods opened at 3.1 yuan. Hengyu Natiao once rose to 4.1 yuan, but because Shanghai came out with US dollars for May 0625, Dachangxiang Daxing Yong Bingxing Hongli and others sold Xian and fell to 2 yuan. Bingxing Chunyuan Yong took advantage of the low Natiao and reported rising. After entering, Sassoon sought to settle US dollars for June 3125 yuan, Maoyong Hengyu Zhifeng Yongqian Changxiang Tianfeng Daxing Yong and others came in turn and rose to 5 yuan. Although Zhengjin Huabi blocked US dollars in February 4375, Zhifeng Yongzheng Changding Chang and other buying qi were still strong and rose to 6 yuan and 8 corners. Dadecheng Yiyu Shou Tiao had retreated to 5 yuan and 2 corners. Sassoon wanted to buy US dollars for May 9375. Hengxing Yuan Maoyong Zhifeng Yong Fuyu Hengyu bought again and again and rose to 90 yuan and 01 corners. Dalian Gang detaching the closing disk was 688 yuan and 8 corners. After the market closed, Bingxing Meng sold a lot. Dadecheng Yuanchun also sold and fell to 7 yuan. Yuansheng Yong Yuanchang Yong Natiao and a slightly flat check of the highest price between the day 690 yuan and a corner of the lowest price 682 yuan had 8 yuan a corner up and down the result was no different from the previous closing.</p>
<p>The quoted price was reduced by two-fifths of a dime for HSBC Bank's US exchange listing for 33.625, with a combined gold price of 713 yuan, more than the closing price of 25 yuan. The login price for this month was 707 yuan, February was 698 yuan, March was 684 yuan, the morning supplement was 707 yuan, the afternoon supplement was 712 yuan, and the clam red price was 1,082 yuan. The London raw gold rose by one shilling and four pence. The field was sold by the Tianjin Gang to the same industry from 1,082.5 yuan to 1,083 yuan, and the transaction totaled about 1,000 taels. The two-month drop in the three-month period was posted by Tongyi to Shunli at 42 units, totaling 13 yuan and one corner. Yuanchun posted 105 units to Wanxing at 13 yuan. Because of changes in Hengyu and Yuanchun in this month's slip, there are still 1,561 units left.</p>
<p>The in-house transactions were still strong. Overall, Wanxing Hengyu Zhifeng Yong Hengtai Yuanchun Xianghe Yuan Maoyong Tianfeng Ding Chang Ruixing and others were on the buying side. Dachangxiang Bingxing Yuan Mao Daxing Yong Yuanheng Zhaofeng Chang Hengxing Yuan Ren Fayong Shentai Heng Hengchang Yong Hui Xiang and others were on the selling side. Hengxing Qian Changxiang Dafayong Changsheng Yong Yifeng Yong and others first came out and then entered. Bingxing Yi Dayong Shunli and other advanced slips out. The Dalian Gang Shunli totaled more than 3,100, and only a few were taken out of Wanxing, totaling less than 2,800, with more than 700 slips in. The Guangdong Gang Hengxing had about 400 in and out. There were 7,406 slips in February, and 38,262 chips in March as of today.</p>
<p>The silver price fell little.</p>
<h3>British and American Exchange Rates Each Loosen by 1875</h3>
<p>Sassoon &amp; Co. Still Engaging in Speculation</p>
<p>Yesterday, according to London telegraph, the main rate was close to a long 0.625. The American Bank rate dropped 25. British exchange rate against the US dollar fell by one dime and one point, 875. The US dollar against the British pound fell by eight and a half points. The British exchange rate against the French franc fell by five dimes and six. The US dollar against the French franc shrank by five points, 75. The forward silver price shrank by 1.5%. The private telegraph silver price remained unchanged. The exchange rate dropped 6 points, 875. The morning opening of the exchange market saw the near-term selling price of British exchange at one shilling, four pence, four, 375. The US exchange rate was 34 yuan. Compared to the previous calculation, the British rate loosened by 125, while the US exchange rate opened flat. Afterwards, due to bank speculation, it remained flat. Later, there was a telegraph message from the US about issuing paper money, but because the HSBC quote was announced, the British rate rose by 125, and the US rate dropped by 25. The Indian long rupee rose by half a rupee. The German long rate rose by 25. The Little Luzon rate dropped by half a shield. The rest remained unchanged. For a time, it was still difficult to loosen excessively. However, after receiving telegraph messages about the US purchasing gold and passing the reduction of fineness, the situation solidified.

<p>Securities</p>
<h3>Bond Market Suddenly Experiences a Sharp Rise</h3>
<p>All Rising Sharply by Several Dimes to One Yuan and Two or Three Dimes</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange suddenly experienced a sharp rise. This was a reaction to several days of brewing. The continuous rise of three sessions was very strong. The salt tax broke through the 50 yuan mark, which had already met the expectations of general bulls. Most bond markets have also found new high prices. After this special sudden rise, its accumulation and release are almost exhausted. With sharp advances, be careful of reactions to reactions. Most of the entrants are retail investors. Large investors only bought slightly more in the first session (31 and 38), and the rest were scattered covering of short positions and swap selling. Large investors 4 and 46 were the most active. It is heard that 46 sold a significant amount of the remaining balance. Others, such as the Northern Gang and 41, were also in selling positions. Retail short positions gradually turned into large investors. In the current situation, there are many important proposals in the Fourth Plenary Session, and there are still many disputes in the future. The market price of public bonds is also rising too sharply, and it is feared that it will not rise in a straight line. Even if it continues to be good, there will be many twists and turns. Yesterday morning, the first session rose by three or four dimes, the second session rose by six or seven dimes, and the afternoon opening session rose by seven or eight dimes. Most of the floating short positions have withdrawn from the line. The sales of 46 and 4, etc., are all actual goods and there is no reason to recover them. Therefore, the closing immediately saw a slight return to loosening. The future is not to be taken too optimistically. As a result, the market price rose by several dimes to one yuan and two or three dimes. The total transaction volume was 25,398,000 yuan, of which 8,000 yuan was in spot goods and 10,550,000 yuan was in futures subject to tax, including 3,370,000 yuan for disarmament, 2,490,000 yuan for the 19 Customs, 3,895,000 yuan for the 20 rolls and 20 Customs, 3,020,000 yuan for the gold short and the whole six, and the rest ranged from tens of thousands to over a million yuan.</p>
<h3>New York Sugar Industry Stock Recently Soared</h3>
<p>New Feng, 18th, foreign firm New York stock market report: The stock market is calm, with only a few dimes of review. However, commercial news is good, including forecasts of improved railway freight, so the foundation is firm. Sugar stocks are the strongest. Due to the slightly better situation in Cuba and the reduction of sugar inventory by 115,100 tons, this is the first major reduction since 1922-1923. The total daily transaction volume was 2,130,000 shares. The weak British exchange rate for wheat caused a sharp drop in Bao Feng, with absorption appearing from time to time, and trading was quiet. Cotton: The government made a large amount of disposals, which were absorbed by the factories.</p>
<p>The reaction to the government's planting reduction plan is still considered smooth. However, according to rumors, the Minister of Agriculture's estimates cannot be trusted for the complete success of the planting reduction plan. The results will not be clear until the end of the month. The spot yarn is slightly clear, and brokers' opinions are quite inconsistent. The price of gold purchased by the Financial Rehabilitation Agency is 34.45 yuan per tael, unchanged. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks: 103.30, down 0.20</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks: 46.34, up 0.05</p>
<p>20 Utility Stocks: 25.88, down 0.24</p>
<p>40 Bonds: 88.14, up 0.26</p>
<p>11 Commodities: 51.34, down 0.11</p>
<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<p>The End of the Old Lunar Year is Approaching</p>
<h3>Spot Yarn Sales Are Even More Scattered</h3>
<p>The yarn market is calm and the situation is slightly stable, but the actual demand is still sluggish. As the end of the old lunar year is approaching, various merchants are reducing their purchases, so people's hearts are weak. Moreover, there are still more than 20,000 pieces of yarn in the warehouses, and the price of Japanese yarn is trending downward, especially affecting Chinese yarn.</p>
<h3>Man-made Fiber Auction is Quiet</h3>
<p>The opening of the man-made fiber auction was still soft due to the decline of foreign cotton. Each month fell by 1.4 jiao. In the afternoon, a portion covered short positions, and each month rebounded by 2.3.4 jiao. The total number of transactions for the day was 8,300 bales. It was found that Ruidah sold 1,050 bales, Dafeng 400 bales, Changfeng 450 bales, Yuanda 550 bales, and Tongfu 250 bales.

<p>Guangdong 90 Ningbo 5 Shantou 35 Yunnan 80 Luzhou 1</p>
<p>Nanjing 2</p>
<h3>After-market of Standardized Cotton Auction Suddenly Experienced Buying Sentiment</h3>
<p>The cotton market initially fell and then rose, but the market situation was quite high. Due to the severe cold weather, heavy rain and snow, and frozen river routes, sources from all sides were difficult to arrive and there was a lack of goods, so people were optimistic about the high prices. However, Indian cotton fell sharply by 4 rupees, but people's hearts were not affected in any way. In the afternoon, the market rebounded and exceeded the number of the previous day, showing the strength of the market sentiment. However, the situation of foreign cotton was flat.</p>
<h3>Zheng Standard is Firm and Lively</h3>
<p>The opening of the Zheng Standard cotton market in the morning followed the decline of foreign cotton and fell by one dime. After two or three sessions of trading, bullish buyers purchased and then rose again. As a result, each month rose or fell by five points. In the afternoon, the buying sentiment suddenly rose, and the dark market for Indian cotton rebounded by 2 rupees. The situation was particularly tight, and each month rose by one and a half dimes to three dimes. The total number of transactions for the day was 57,900 dan.

<p>Lingmai cotton: 45.00. Gongda Factory purchased 83 pieces of spot goods delivered to the factory.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Plunges</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market fell due to unfavorable news from Liverpool, foreign firms selling, and bulls settling. As a result, spot goods fell by 5 pounds and futures fell by 1 to 11 pounds. Liverpool spot cotton rose by 2 points and futures rose by 4 to 7 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods fell by 17 points. The Mumbai cotton market initially fell due to bull settlement, and then rebounded due to short covering. As a result, Pingar fell by 2 rupees, Oumra fell by 3 and a half rupees, and Bairoxi fell by 4 rupees and 2 jiao and a half. The original telegraph record is on the left (18th telegraph):</p>

<h3>Grain and Flour Both Show Signs of Weakness</h3>
<p>The flour market was generally flat and weak in the morning and afternoon after opening. Since the quoted price of foreign wheat in Chicago and Canada both returned to around two or three jiao, the market sentiment was consistently flat after opening. As the purchases from both inside and outside the industry were extremely weak, the market situation was quite difficult to rise or fall. The attitude of the factories was that the negotiations on the flour and wheat borrowed by the government had not been resolved, so the long-term dumping of goods was also temporarily suspended. The Tianjin gang, however, softened slightly because the spot sales were not improving and the standard sector had returned to the market. As a result, this month was slightly less than 5 li, February remained unchanged, March was slightly less than 5 li, and April, May, and June were all slightly less than 2.5 li.</p>
<p>The wheat market was two-sided and both buyers and sellers were waiting and watching, and there was no activity in or out. Only three sessions of trading were opened before and after, and the price remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Bengbu Soybeans are Selling Well</h3>
<p>Local bean market is tightening</p>
<p>Although soybean trading was slight yesterday, the market situation was perhaps stable. Because the news from Bengbu was that sales were smooth, the sellers were worried that the source of goods would be short, and the general merchants had the intention of raising prices and selling tightly. The market sentiment was standing. Yesterday, one truckload of Xuzhou beans was sold at 3 yuan and 5 jiao. This street handled the deal. Another two truckloads of Zhengyangguan beans were sold at 3 yuan, 5 jiao and 7 to 5 jiao, and were distributed to Fuzhou and inland. Another 700 bags of Dangshan beans were sold at a price of 3 yuan, 4 jiao 9 to 4 jiao 6, and were traded by factories and inland. The selling price was unchanged from the previous market.</p>
<p>North and South Foreign Merchants Actively Handling</p>
<h3>Thick and Thin Japonica Rice, Over 3,000 Bags</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of goods for each gang was relatively large, with about 50 warehouses (over 7,000 shi) arriving. Late rice accounted for about 20 ships. The initial destination was still normal, and afterwards, visiting merchants flocked in, and the situation was lively. The Northern Foreign Gang first opened, and then the Southern Foreign Gang also started to take action. The sellers seized the opportunity to shout high prices. As a result, the Northern and Southern Foreign Gangs purchased over 3,000 bags of thick and thin japonica rice. Thick japonica rice was not favored. The price of late rice rose by 5 cents. The goods purchased were thick japonica rice from Luhu and Taozhuang, each with one ship. The late rice was all from Qingjiao, Songsi, Fengjing, and Xilian, etc. Therefore, it seems that there is not much late rice left. I don’t know if there is hope for a turnaround in the future market. Although this street's destination is slightly better than before, the market situation is stable and soft due to the large number of goods. Because of this, the price of Changbang Su Tong and other japonica rice is slightly lower by several cents. Du Yangjian is still stable and the Yuan market color seems to be slightly soft, but there is no excessive rise or fall.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) About 10 ships from all sources, all kinds of destinations in the market continue to have white japonica rice, thin rice, and indica rice with sheep. The prices are firm and stable. The prices of early rice and Yinbian Yuanbu Ke Xian rice, etc. are stable.</p>
<h3>Ke Xian Rice Transactions After the Stabilization of the Fujian Bureau</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Fujian gang purchased 2,000 bags</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Ke Xian rice market was on the rise because of the continuous arrival of merchants from Fujian Province to the market for purchasing. The cargo owners repeatedly shouted high prices. Yesterday, the Fujian gang's purchase was still lively, and there were still inquiries from this street and the Kui gang. The price was still rising by 5 or 6 cents. Moreover, because the Fujian gang's backing was still strong, the market still had the hope of rising higher. Yesterday, it was calculated that 1,642 bags of Hunan coarse red rice were handled by the Fujian provincial gang at a price of 5 yuan and 7 jiao. Another 400 bags of coarse Jing rice were priced at 5 yuan, 7 jiao and a half to 5 yuan, 7 jiao. 671 bags of Jiangxi machine late rice were handled, and the Ningbo gang also handled more than 300 bags of machine late rice at a price of 7 yuan, 2 jiao and a half to 7 yuan and 2 points. This street handled 100 bags of Wuhu machine Yuan rice at a price of 7 yuan and 5 jiao and a half and 60 bags of Hunan machine oil rice at a price of 6 yuan and 9 jiao and a half.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Workers' Cost of Living Index for 1933</h3>

The total index for 1933 was 97, a decrease of 10% compared to 1932 and a decrease of 15% compared to 1931 and a decrease of 17% compared to 1930. Since 1926, except for the index of 93 in 1928 (1926 equals 100), all others have been above 100, with 116 in 1930 being the highest, followed by 113 in 1931.

<p>Silk and Tea</p>
<h3>Silk Waste and By-products Are Slightly Exported</h3>
<p>The overall situation is still difficult to be optimistic</p>
<p>Since Japan's abundant silk production has caused an excess in the European and American markets and a sharp drop in prices, it has restricted silk exports in order to raise silk prices. Since the beginning of the year, Japan's silk exports have decreased by 30%. Therefore, factory by-products exported to the United States have been slightly smoother. This month, the American postal ship has 537 packages of yellow and white factory by-products loaded to American-owned New York, Seattle and other ports. India's consumption of our country's silk waste (i.e. silk ends and by-products) has increased sharply, with a monthly demand of 1,000 packages. Therefore, since the beginning of the year, the export of silk waste to the UK has been smoother. In the past half month, 787 packages have been transported to India. However, the overall trend is still difficult to be optimistic. Silk weaving factories in New York are still sluggish in their intake of raw silk, and silk prices are still difficult to stand firm. The opening price of Japanese silk in Lyon is still low, and the price of Chinese silk is still considered too high in telegraphs. Furthermore, the foreign exchange is tight, and the deduction of prices is even smaller. The attitude of European firms in Shanghai is negative. Chinese silk merchants are unwilling to seek sales due to the huge losses in the prices coming from the mesh door. The market is quiet. Yesterday, only the Shanghai Silk Factory purchased 10 packages of yellow factory by-products and 5 packages of yellow soil silk. The price is still sluggish.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>This factory's fine white sugar suddenly rises by 2 dimes</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was still good due to the upward trend of customs duties and gold prices. The guild's clearing price for No. 24 coarse sand white ordinary goods was 19 yuan and 2 jiao and a half, which was another 5 cents higher than the previous day.

<h3>Metal</h3>
<p>Spot tin is extremely scarce</p>
<p>The spot tin market has been very good recently, but the incoming goods are very few, and the market is often in short supply. The spot goods circulating in the city recently are extremely scarce, and the incoming goods are also less, so the standards are rising steadily. For example, the price of Xiaoyan tin is 195 yuan per dan, Dutch tin is 216 yuan, Dou tin is 210 yuan, Xuanzu is 217 yuan, and solder is 62 yuan. It is heard that 2-300 dan of transactions were made. In addition, there were transactions of Jianghua Hengdi Hook light tin and other tin, but the market price was very low and there was no difference.</p>

<h3>[Commercial Competition] and [Literary Talent]</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhimo</p>
<p>Mr. Shen Congwen said: "[Literary talent] combined with [commercial competition] forms our current concept of the term 'Shanghai School'." I think this is incorrect. [Literary talent] and [commercial competition] are actually two things that cannot be [combined]. Historically, literati have always looked down upon merchants, and merchants have always been indifferent to literati, because literati value elegance and consider merchants vulgar, while merchants value practical benefits and consider literati mad. Moreover, literati often rely on the power of officials to exploit merchants, which is most hated by merchants. The two are fundamentally opposed.</p>
<p>Merchants diligently pursue profit, while admiring the lofty pursuits of literati in composing poetry and enjoying the moon. However, there are many people today who compose poetry and enjoy the moon, but they are not necessarily literati, because they may not have the backing of official power. The condition for becoming a literatus is not just [talent], but even more important is official power. So-called literati are actually officials or underlings of officials. When officials are successful, they have no desire nor need to compose poetry and enjoy the moon, but in order to gain a reputation for promoting elegance, they order their underlings to compose and enjoy. These underlings are mostly talented people. However, officials always have times of failure. At these times, they become bored, so they themselves start to compose poetry and enjoy the moon, and become literati. For example, General Wu Ziyu was indeed a hero of his time, but after stepping down from power, he developed a considerable interest in refined pursuits.</p>
<p>In this regard, if there is indeed a distinction between the [Shanghai School] and the [Beijing School] in the literary world, then I believe that [commercial competition] is the characteristic of the former, while [literary talent] is the characteristic of the latter. Shanghai School writers mostly regard manuscript fees as their primary goal, so they cannot avoid unsightly behaviors such as [opportunism] and [weather-vane shifting]. Beijing School writers, on the other hand, are either university professors or hold government positions, living off the resources of bureaucratic institutions. Their foundations are solid, and their salaries are generous, so they do not have to appear as desperate as Shanghai School writers, and therefore do not need to [speculate] or [watch the wind].</p>
<p>Both merchants and literati need money. However, the money used by merchants is directly earned through their own means, while the money used by literati comes in a more roundabout way. It starts from the hands of ordinary people, passes through countless institutions, and when it reaches the hands of literati, the stench has completely disappeared, like eating lamb after being far away from the kitchen. This is where the purity of literati lies. It is also why they can so loudly scold merchants.</p>
<p>But Shanghai is, after all, a complex place. There are indeed as many Shanghai School writers engaged in [commercial competition] as there are carp crossing the river, but there are also some Beijing School writers with [literary talent]. However, the two have never truly [combined], only successfully creating a [Shanghai-Beijing hybrid] circus.</p>
<h3>[Appreciating Standard Beauty]</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Yutang said: "[The current society is a male society, so people like to paint nude women. In a female society, people would definitely like to draw nude men, and they would definitely call it 'appreciating standard beauty'.]" Then he said: "[A male dog, if it could paint, would definitely consider the thighs of a female dog as the pinnacle of standard beauty. The same goes for a female dog drawing a male dog.]" (My words in Analects, issue 30.) Explaining the root of art from a biological perspective may shock moralists, but philosophers and artists cannot answer this, but here we find a satisfactory answer. Nietzsche said, "[Beauty and ugliness can both be explained in biological terms.]" That is the meaning.</p>
<p>Once the human body reaches puberty, due to the nourishment of internal secretions, several special characteristics appear: the chest suddenly expands, the buttocks develop into curves, the voice becomes very soft, and the hair becomes lustrous; these are all important repositories of beauty. [The close connection between human beauty and secondary sexual characteristics is an undeniable fact. DeGonrmont said: "[If you ask a toad, what is beautiful? It will tell you: its mate is the most beautiful, with two large and round eyes protruding from its small head, a large and flat mouth, a yellow belly, and a cherry-colored back.]" The same principle applies to humans.</p>
<p>But why do Chinese people avoid talking about [human beauty]? Because gentlemen are very sensitive, and the moment sexual organs are mentioned, obscene ideas arise. Mr. Lu Xun said that talented men in the past could write poems of lovesickness just by finding a handkerchief. And Du Liniang in The Peony Pavilion fell in love to death just by dreaming of a man. Under moral vigilance, this kind of love-sick psychology is inevitable; such people certainly dare not face [human beauty] directly. There are also some sex maniacs who see obscene pictures on the streets, obscene porcelain dolls like Jia Baoyu or Lin Daiyu, or practice the so-called [ugly behavior of both sexes], and then think that human beauty is just like this; these people cannot understand [human beauty] either. When it comes to the appreciation of beauty, Chinese people are still far from the standard of health!</p>
<p>Recently, there has been more and more talk about the state of society and people's hearts. In the end, it is nothing more than advocating old morality; all the sins of old morality in damaging human nature and the human body are passed over without mentioning. I believe that only by popularizing biological knowledge, facing the facts head-on, and not distorting the explanations, can the state of society and people's hearts gradually turn for the better. Darwin wrote in The Descent of Man: "[As far as we can judge, the appreciation of beauty shown by most animals is limited to attracting the opposite sex.]" And cited the nest-building behavior of a bird called Bower-bird as proof. What makes moralists tongue-tied is plain and unremarkable in biology and requires no surprise.</p>
<p>Some people think that Mr. Lin Yutang is deliberately making strange arguments, so I extend his meaning to clarify it as above.</p>
<h3>Sickness</h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>My wife is sick.</p>
<p>She lies in bed all day and all night, as if the god of sleep has taken away her soul. Even if she slept for a whole year, she wouldn't say she slept too much. Only mealtime is the only time she leaves the bedside. As a result, the small room seems much colder and deathly silent, so stuffy that you can't even take a long breath. Some scattered objects are covered in a layer of dust, and some simply seem to be sulking because they haven't been taken care of by their mistress. All this is because of my wife's illness, which has deprived them of someone to take care of them. A man can only sigh at the scattered things, and rarely gets into the habit of carefully tidying them up. My wife's illness is indeed a great torment to her physically, but she rarely groans or cries, probably because she's afraid of making me anxious. Even so, my mental state has undergone considerable changes, so that whatever I do, I'm always floating like a cloud in the sky, unable to settle down. I can't stop to think about what steps to take to deal with each current task, how to do it, and to what extent it should be done. Sometimes, I realize how ridiculous and foolish my approach to a certain event was after the fact, and I'm really worried about my abnormal state.</p>
<p>My wife is sick, and I'm almost sick too.</p>
<p>But I'm still a little stronger than her. At least I don't sleep like her! And I can cook for her, open the window for her, let the outside air into the room, let the sun shine on her bed; I can also say some comforting words to her as much as possible.</p>
<p>I'm not sick, I'm a good person.</p>
<p>[Why did the illness fall on me?]</p>
<p>Sometimes, just as she finished her meal and before lying down on the bed, my wife would say this to herself. She was anxious.</p>
<p>Hearing her words, I didn't know how to answer at that time. Really, how can people like us, who have difficulty eating even a mouthful of rice, still afford to get sick? Only rich people can afford to be sick for a long time. If people like us are sick, I'm afraid some big doctors will have no food to eat. We can't afford to see a doctor. We don't have that much spare money. The illness grows on our bodies, and we can only let it take its course. But I have to put my wife at ease, so I can only pretend to smile and say to her:</p>
<p>[Don't worry, you'll be better in a few days.]</p>
<p>As soon as I said this, I felt a little embarrassed again. A husband who can't take out money for his wife to see a doctor should just leave his wife and save her from being so tired.</p>
<p>I can't say whether this idea is correct, because there are still some people who advocate that a wife doesn't have to rely on her husband to maintain her life.</p>
<p>I don't therefore admit that poor people shouldn't have wives. On the contrary, a man should have a wife, and a woman should have a husband. Poverty, wealth, and illness are another matter.</p>
<p>My wife is sick, and I'm sick too. We don't know when we'll get better. My wife said, [Why did the illness fall on me?] I want to ask further:</p>
<p>[Why can't we see a doctor?]</p>
<h3>Half a Day in Songjiang (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Hua Shangwen</p>
<p>He bought a pack of cigarettes, took one out, and put it to the goat's mouth. It sniffed it with its nose, then swallowed it into its mouth and chewed it like grass. Someone gave it a lit cigarette, but it avoided it.</p>
<p>Mr. C said again: [So it's strange, it doesn't eat lit cigarettes.]</p>
<p>But when Mr. C himself gave it a lit cigarette and an unlit cigarette mixed together, it chewed it without hesitation. We were worried and waited beside it for a while, but it showed no signs of pain. Presumably, its mouth wasn't burned. At that time, a friend laughed and said that Mr. Lin Yutang used to praise beggars who smoked opium. If he saw this goat, he would probably write a long article to praise it. Not far from the Dongyue Temple is the Xilin Temple, our destination. The pagoda is called the Xilin Pagoda, standing in front of the main hall. When the monk saw a large group of tourists coming in, he took out the key and came out, reaching out for money to open the door. After some discussion, the door at the bottom of the pagoda was opened, but no one wanted to go up. I thought that maybe I could see Taihu Lake from above, so I volunteered to be the first to run up. Several people followed. The stairs were very narrow, but not very high. When I reached the top floor, I did see a few pieces of vast water in the distance. I felt that it didn't look like Taihu Lake, so Mr. S, who was acting as a guide, told me: [That's not Taihu Lake, that's Mao, which is the three Maos mentioned in the books.] I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed. I could also see a pagoda in the distance. According to Mr. S, that was the Fangta Pagoda, because the pagoda is square. So, this pagoda should be called the Octagonal Pagoda. I think the name Fangta Pagoda is probably a common name. Unfortunately, it was already late, and the Fangta Pagoda was far away, so we didn't go.</p>
<p>In the dim twilight, we walked back the way we came. We crossed a small bridge, turned right, and arrived at the Shanghai-Songjiang highway. At this time, no cars had passed by, and the empty ground seemed even more desolate. It is said that the buses stop running after four o'clock, fearing danger. After leaving the highway, we walked into an alley. After walking not far, Mr. S stopped in front of a bungalow and said:</p>
<p>[Inside is the Wall Tomb. Would everyone like to see it?]</p>
<p>There was no answer, but everyone followed him in. In the middle of the courtyard stood a short Western-style tombstone, with some horizontal sentences engraved on it. At first glance, it looked like celestial script and couldn't be read. Later, I saw the English engraved on the back, and then I realized that it was a direct translation of the English, and the reading order was also from bottom to top. The gentleman who translated these English sentences was very good. If he understood a little philosophical jargon, he might have shown off something like [the symbol of life] [the life of the symbol].</p>
<p>This is just an aside. What made people feel emotional at that time was General Wall himself. Speaking of Wall, people of our generation probably all know him. The stories of the Ever Victorious Army were recorded in the Chinese and history textbooks of elementary schools at that time, and the three names of Wall, Burgevine, and Gordon were deeply imprinted in our immature minds. After the Xinhai Revolution, the high tide of the revolution swept away the stale ideas in our minds. The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom became the precursor of the revolution, and the three great idols of Zeng, Zuo, and Li, who were famous for a generation, were denounced as national traitors and collaborators. People like Wall were naturally snubbed, but no one had recognized their true colors. Some people may not admit that Zeng and Li's creation of the Ever Victorious Army was to use the power of foreigners to slaughter Chinese peasants for the Manchu Qing, while others said that the [Longhairs] also had a foreign background. This is nothing more than mutual slander. Now, everyone understands. Wall and the other two were neither meritorious officials of the Manchu Qing nor good friends of Zeng and Li. They were really the executioners of the first suppression of the Chinese revolution by imperialism. The Manchu Qing was too weak! Therefore, international imperialism helped him organize the Ever Victorious Army. What is amazing is that the nationalities of Wall (American), Burgevine (French), and Gordon (British) were completely different, but they were consistently involved in training the Ever Victorious Army to slaughter Chinese peasants. This reminds people of how Yuan Shikai used advisors from various countries, and the result was that they all unanimously advised him to advance to the throne. This is by no means accidental. Moreover, Wall's tombstone was erected by the American Veterans Wall Corps. The fact that American veterans have a Wall Corps reminds people of the Japanese Black Dragon Society of retired soldiers. Thinking about it again and again, I don't understand why foreigners have always been so concerned about China's bandits. Therefore, Wall's monument cannot be easily forgotten.</p>
<p>In the dim twilight, on the train back to Shanghai, I was always thinking about this matter.</p>
<h3>Father and Daughter</h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>She has recently clearly seen what her father is suffering from again, which makes her feel surprised. Because for a year, her father has been living so well. Although her father's heart was almost in pain every day before; but a year ago, she herself said that she was willing to accompany her father for the rest of her life. At that time, when she saw his eyes containing glistening tears, didn't she also fall into her father's arms and cry bitterly? She wasn't sad, she was recalling how she had known since she understood things that her father had been living lonely, raising her day by day. Although he didn't say it explicitly, she also knew that her father was so afraid that she would fall in love with someone, follow that person, and leave him alone to spend his lonely twilight years; but she told her father that her daughter had the wish to stay by her father's side. She remembered that he had been happy since then, and he seemed younger; but in recent days, she saw that he had become depressed again.</p>
<p>Sometimes she would come in from outside. Her father was already gone, but his cane was still in the corner. When she called the servant to inquire, she only said that he had gone out alone and didn't know where he was. So she picked up the cane and went to look for him according to her own intention. She easily saw him standing alone in a park half a mile away from home, as if he was thinking about something. He would slowly move his steps and walk into the deep forest. She immediately shouted:</p>
<p>[Dad, can you wait for me?]</p>
<p>At this time, he would show a little surprise, stop, turn around, and smile at her with a little joy and a little annoyance on his face.</p>
<p>[You forgot to take your cane, I brought it to you.]</p>
<p>She walked to her father's side, standing on his left, but put the cane in her father's right hand.</p>
<p>Her father looked at her, his eyes flashing with a little light, as if saying: [Why did you come? Can't you let me be alone here?]</p>
<p>She knew that she didn't dare to look at her father's face. She just said it was getting late and led her father back home.</p>
<p>[Are you still afraid of the dark like a child?]</p>
<p>[That's right, Dad, I can't leave you. When it gets dark, I'm afraid you'll abandon me.]</p>
<p>Following her father's words, she deliberately pretended to be a child. She spoke like a child and wrapped her hands around her father's left arm; but her heart was suddenly occupied by sourness, and tears almost dripped from her eyes.</p>
<p>[Dinner is ready, I roasted a chicken for you, and made some soup with water shield bought from Hangzhou, and I also bought you some smoked fish.]</p>
<p>She deliberately babbled.</p>

<p>Shen Bao Radio Weekly</p>
<h3>Editor's Note</h3>
<p>In a China where the people are poor and the wealth is exhausted, to promote radio so that it is widespread among the masses, we can only study crystal sets, because crystal sets are cheap to buy, the adjustment procedure is simple, and once a set is purchased, no further expenses are required. Therefore, Japan in the East is even advocating nationwide crystal sets in order to save people's economy, and our China cannot manufacture vacuum tubes by ourselves, so it is naturally more necessary to promote them.</p>
<p>Although crystal sets are simple, there are still many places to study, such as the oscillation of crystals, special crystal set circuits, etc., which all require us to examine. We hope that radio researchers across the country can pay attention to this economical crystal set and study it, and at the same time, we hope that those who promote radio can also pay attention to the economic capacity of the people across the country and promote the nationwide crystal set, which is what we send.</p>
<h3>Research on Crystal Sets and Their Reception Distance</h3>
<p>— Yi Zhi</p>
<p>Speaking of ordinary crystal sets, people often suffer from unsatisfactory results. What is the reason? In order to improve the efficiency of crystal sets, to be able to receive sound loudly, select sensitively, and receive from a distance, the following four items should be noted, which are briefly described below.</p>
<p>(1) Antenna Circuit</p>
<p>All the electrical energy of a crystal set comes from the oscillation on the antenna. The strength of the oscillation current affects the height of the reception efficiency. Within a certain limit, the selectivity and sensitivity of the antenna have a certain relationship. A short antenna has better selectivity; a high antenna has stronger sensitivity. Often, a short and high antenna is better than a long and low antenna. Therefore, a legal antenna installation can increase the reception efficiency. The following points should be noted during installation: ㈠ The antenna insulator must be good ㈡ The antenna wire must not be too thin ㈢ The antenna height must be above two meters ㈣ The antenna and lead-in wire must not be too long, and the place where it enters the house must be insulated and isolated from other objects ㈤ The wire must be buried in the ㈥ The antenna lead-in wire is too long, solid.</p>
<p>(2) Spectrum</p>
<p>From the antenna, the energy is gathered on the induction and capacitor devices. Changing the size of the , investigate the wavelength and the external same. The harmonic generates vibration. After calling the detector, the stethoscope emits. The path occupies an important part of the crystal set, so attention should be paid to matching. When the induction in the resonant path is made, the diameter should not be too small, and the wire should not be too thin. If the number of turns is increased by observation and wound on a small , the loss of electricity is very large. The selection of capacitors must also be the fixed piece. The insulator of the piece must be good glue. If you choose cardboard, it will easily lose electrical energy in wet weather and moldy rainy seasons, reducing the reception.</p>
<p>(3) Crystal</p>
<p>The crystal completes the detection of the high-frequency current into the audio frequency. The efficiency of its detection is often different on the crystal, so you must adjust the contact to the most important point when using it, then the reception is loud and far away. The quality of the crystal can be distinguished in terms of form and substance. Generally, the surface is more bumpy and radiant, and those with more receiving points are good products. Those with flat and dull surfaces and fewer receiving points are inferior products. The crystal often becomes low in reception due to long-term use. One reason is that dust enters, and the other is that it generates electricity with the air. The method to prevent this is to make the crystal in a glass cover. Also pay attention. Do not touch the crystal with your hands. If there is dust, wipe it with alcohol or scrape it lightly with a knife.</p>
<p>(4) Stethoscope</p>
<p>The quality of the stethoscope depends on its magnetism and the number of turns of the wire. The one used on the crystal set has a minimum resistance of two thousand ohms, which is sensitive to sound. The following conditions must be observed when using the stethoscope: ㈠ Do not knock or subject it to violent vibrations, ㈡ The moisture on the thin wax must be wiped dry from time to time.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to talk about the reception ability of crystal sets. Ordinary crystal sets can receive from about fifty or sixty miles away from a power station of one hundred watts. If it can be researched and improved and used properly, it can reach as far as one or two hundred miles. As for receiving long-wave telegrams, it can be as far as one or two thousand miles. Now that the Central Radio Station has been completed, within a radius of four or five hundred miles, such as Yangzhou, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Wuxi, Qingpu, Wuhu and other places, according to the local radio reports, the Central Radio Station can be received very clearly with a crystal set. It is also said that someone in Hangzhou has received the Central Radio Station with a crystal set, and its reception distance is quite amazing. Therefore, if the crystal set can be used properly, its performance can be better than a single-tube vacuum tube machine with poor circuit. So I hope people don't dislike it for being old and abandon it. Let's all get up and study and improve it together! (The End)</p>
<h3>Operating Principle of Crystal Detector</h3>
<p>— Cai Guanghua</p>
<p>Before talking about the operating principle of the crystal detector, we should first understand a strange phenomenon. We know that when two different crystals or a crystal and a metal needle touch together, a resistance occurs. This resistance is enough to make the current flowing between the crystals or between the crystal and the metal needle only flow in one direction. This is the single transmission (UnilateratCondcuctivity) of the crystal detector that is commonly spoken of. Such contact has the function of rectification, so it is also called a contact rectifier (Contat·Rectifer)</p>
<p>Suppose we connect an alternating voltage and a contact rectifier together (see Figure 1, AB two crystals in contact), and we use the Y curve in the second figure to represent the original wave, then the rectified wave can be represented by the Y line in the second figure. From the highest and lowest points (Maxima and Minime) of these two curves, we can get a conclusion, that is, although the positive and negative half-wave amplitudes of the original wave are equal (A1 equals A2 Figure 2X), the result of rectification is A1 greater than A2Y (Figure 2), the positive half-wave is greater than the negative half-wave (rectification must be incomplete). The reason is that it is easier for electrons to flow from B to A than from A to B (Figure 1), in other words, two different crystals or a crystal and a metal needle in contact with each other have a rectifying effect. The crystal detector is the pioneer in managing this effect.</p>
<p>In the detection circuit, after the antenna absorbs external radio waves, a radio frequency current occurs in the antenna. A high-frequency voltage occurs at the two ends of the coil. When the current passes through the crystal, according to the above-mentioned contact rectifier function, only the half-wave current flows through the stethoscope. Then, the stethoscope vibrator is caused to perform various different actions into audio waves by the strength of the current.</p>
<p>Because the crystal detector can only receive damped wave radio messages or radio telephones, but cannot receive continuous wave radio messages, so the crystal radio cannot listen to telegrams, which is the biggest shortcoming of the crystal detector.</p>
<h3>Special Galena Radio Circuit</h3>
<p>— Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>丨Introduction to Two Full-Wave Galena Radios丨</p>
<p>We know that galena can detect signals because it is a unidirectional conductor. Therefore, the audio signal received by an ordinary galena radio is only half the power of the external radio wave, and the other half of the electrical energy has to be discarded. Now, by using two galena crystals placed in opposite directions, the power of the external radio wave can be completely captured. Since the electrical energy received by the radio has doubled, the output volume will naturally increase accordingly.</p>
<p>The first method is to modify the commonly used headphones into two sections, each with two terminals that are not connected to each other (see Figure 3). After connecting according to the circuit in Figure 1, a double power audio signal can be obtained.</p>
<p>Figure 2: The headphones are not modified. First, input the audio signal into the primary coil of two low-frequency transformers, and connect the headphones to the two secondary coils to achieve the same result.</p>
<p>This article aims to save space, so the description is as simple as possible. As for the detailed theory, I will describe it later.</p>

<h3>Children's Year and Family Education</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Chinese children have always been little valued by people. Fortunately, they have been brought out by society to hold a [Children's Year]. [Children's Day] has been stipulated in almost all modern civilized countries long ago. European and American countries, and even Japan, pay close attention to children's affairs. The establishment of children's parks, children's libraries, nurseries, children's training homes, and juvenile delinquent reformatories has become commonplace. Only our backward China has not seen anyone organize children's affairs, and the status of children has not been clearly recognized. How can we know that children are the lifeblood of society, country, and nation; their relationship to the civilization of society, the survival of the country, and the rise and fall of the nation is of utmost importance. Therefore, if we want to transform society, transform the country, and transform the nation, we should start with children first. This is the meaning of holding this year's [Children's Year].</p>
<p>The expectations of [Children's Year] for children, generally speaking, are nothing more than to enable every Chinese child to become a physically and mentally healthy citizen in the future, so as to seek welfare for the future of society, country, and nation. The strength of personal physical and mental health is half due to innate heredity and half due to acquired cultivation. Leaving aside the innate heredity for the moment; the tool for acquired cultivation is of course education; and education is divided into family education and school education, the former being more important than the latter, so let's just talk about this aspect.</p>
<p>The status of children in Chinese families is very low; they are often regarded as private property by their parents. Parents in ordinary families either regard children as a [comfort item], or as a [tool for preventing old age], or [inheritors of ancestors' incense], they have almost no awareness that children bear a major mission, that they are the backbone of the future society, the beams of the country, and the pioneers of the nation. Therefore, the parents' concept of their children is wrong: therefore, they do not pay attention to the family education of their children. Parents in general wealthy families treat their children with a completely laissez-faire attitude; they only know how to indulge them and give them full satisfaction in enjoyment, while forgetting the obligations they should fulfill in education. As a result, many children who have no ability, lack knowledge, are arrogant and lazy are cultivated, leaving endless disasters for the future society and country. As for the majority of poor families, the parents are driven by life and work like cattle and horses, they are too busy running around for food and clothing, where do they have the time to educate their children? Moreover, some have never received education and training themselves, and do not even know what family education is. And their children, because they live in hunger and cold, not only do not get beneficial education in spirit; they also often feel a lack of material nutrition, which affects their physical development. The result of this type of family is also nothing more than creating a large number of unhealthy members for society and the country, which is also unfavorable to the community. This is the main reason for the formation of the current corrupt Chinese society. Therefore, to save the ills of Chinese society, we must first raise the status of children; and to raise the status of children, we must start with the implementation of family education. Otherwise, no matter how loud the social figures shout [Children's Year]! [Children are the future masters of the country]! it is just empty talk and does not help the reality.</p>
<p>Regarding the points to be noted in the implementation of family education, there are several important points: 1. Cultivate good habits in children; 2. Improve the bad environment of children; 3. Pay attention to children's diet, daily life, and hygiene; 4. Forge children's strong physique; 5. Nurture children's beautiful character; 6. Instill children's patriotic beliefs; 7. Promote children's desire for knowledge; 8. Guide children's self-government ability; 9. Cultivate children's resolute will, 10. Train children's labor spirit; 11. Promote children's group thinking; 12. Pour children's social awareness; 13. Instruct children's correct behavior, and so on. As for the implementation method, the most appropriate steps can be selected according to the family situation, social needs, and children's interests, and they can be taught, educated, induced, and guided step by step. On the one hand, they should also be sent to school to receive more knowledge and improve their cultivation, so that children can become physically and mentally healthy citizens, and benefit the future society, country, and nation, then the community will benefit a lot! May the parents of our country's families never give up this important responsibility of educating children, this is what we hope for!</p>
<h3>Dying Embers</h3>
<p>— Mi Er</p>
<p>It is very unlucky to talk about [death] at the beginning of this new year. This is the custom. In fact, this kind of custom is entirely psychological, and how does it conform to the facts? For example, according to the old custom, when we meet in the New Year, we must say [Congratulations and get rich!] This old-fashioned greeting is naturally an auspicious word, and it has been said dozens of times, but he will never get rich because of it! Besides, [death] is unavoidable for everyone. What's the harm in talking about it?</p>
<p>However, this word [death] is fundamentally a terrible word. Dr. Johnson, a great British writer of the eighteenth century, was erudite and talented, and was almost the mainstay of the literary and artistic circles of the time. He had great courage to fight against the harsh environment, but when he heard [death], he would involuntarily tremble and be horrified! The terror of [death] is self-evident. However, no matter what, we will eventually avoid the invitation of [death]!</p>
<p>Christianity tells us that we live in the world just like travelers. It means that we will eventually [return to our old home]. Indeed, we have never heard of a person who does not die. However, we are all alive, and of course we do not know the suffering of death. However, we believe that except for a few exceptions, most people cannot help but regret their sins before they die. Newspapers often report that before the execution of bandits, they often advise the audience not to learn from them, and must be good people. Isn't this an expression of his repentance? According to common sense, people are usually ill before they die. This period of illness is probably the moment when people repent or make happy memories before they die, right? Some people are keen on public welfare or benevolent and generous throughout their lives. When they are about to die, they recall all the good deeds in their lives and feel endless joy. People like this can use their natural energy to bear the responsibilities that human beings should bear, and therefore all the joy is the supreme joy of life. But some people, like Zheng Xiaoxu, who stole the country, or politicians, bureaucrats, and villains who trapped the people in misery, unless they die of a sudden illness, what they want to say at the time of death is probably a word of repentance, right? But what can that repentance do for the facts at that time? Some military and political figures repent of their past military sins by saying scriptures and worshiping Buddha. However, their repentance is mostly after being disappointed and out of office, not when they are in power and have great achievements, so their repentance has nothing to do with our ordinary people. In other words, their repentance after doing evil cannot alleviate the pain of us being trapped in misery. In short, death is unavoidable for everyone. If you want to get supreme joy in the short process of life, a person must at least achieve the most perfect results within the possible scope in his position. A student who cannot study hard at ordinary times, and plagiarizes without cheating during the exam, a merchant who operates prohibited goods, a teacher who misleads students, a soldier who cannot defend the country, a politician who cannot benefit the country... No matter how comfortable the lives of such people are, their conscience will be as painful as if ten thousand arrows are shot at them at the moment of death!</p>
<p>Is this completely out of our ideal? No, the confession of the criminals who are about to be executed is our best example!</p>
<p>Do we want to get supreme happiness? Then please do our part first and resolve to be a people who benefit society.</p>
<h3>The Abandoned Child</h3>
<p>Our alley is equipped with a trash can in the first house of each alley. Besides the garbage next to the trash can, what we often find are abandoned children. Today, another one was found. Mom told me [Today there is a child wrapped in yellow cloth next to the trash can, probably only eight or nine days old, with a pair of black and shiny little eyes, looking around lively and lovely, inside the wrapping cloth are the child's birth date and ten yuan, this is for the person who takes in the child. This must be the daughter of someone's family, who conceived an illegitimate child and had no way to abandon it after giving birth.] Then Mom said again: [This child is a boy! And he is very cute, I really want to bring him in and make him your sister-in-law's son, you see, your sister-in-law has been in my house for ten years, and it goes without saying for me and your brother, even our relatives and friends are so eagerly looking forward to it, and they are all waiting anxiously, and gradually feel disappointed. I don't know why your sister-in-law makes vows to recite Buddha, kowtows and worships, and eats some fairy prescriptions and magic medicines, but she doesn't see any effect, and she doesn't give birth to a son or raise a daughter. Because of this, the family is out of harmony, and the economy is overflowing. Your brother takes a concubine outside, and your sister-in-law is sick and takes medicine at home... Today this child is very good, and he is a boy, but my family does not allow a foster son to enter the genealogy and inherit the ancestors, so the rice and food are still nowhere to be found, and finally, if the 'adopted son' dies, he is not allowed to enter the hall, so after thinking about it, I still can't figure out a reason.] After Mom said this, she walked away because of something, leaving me alone in the room. Ah! I thought, how contradictory are the things in society! In my mind, I imagined the situation of the abandoned child's mother, she 丨丨the child's mother, now the pain she is suffering in her heart is so heavy! Anyone loves her own biological children, and of course she is no exception. She wraps ten yuan around the child and puts the child's birth date away. When she gets the child ready to throw away, how shattered should her heart be! She must be suffering from other people's rumors and discussions, and the family's ridicule and scolding... This is because she should not have given birth to this child; my sister-in-law, she desperately wants a child, but she doesn't have one, so my brother has changed his mind, and Mom, who is eager to have a grandson, is also very unhappy. No matter how my sister-in-law can't work hard for this, the family has become out of harmony... This is also because she is asked to have a child but she doesn't have one. Isn't this ridiculously contradictory? Having a child but not having the child's father (the so-called official father), society has no one to attack, not having a child also has to suffer the same similar pain, isn't this the height of farting?...</p>

<h3>[Spiritual Civilization] and [Assimilation]</h3>
<p>— He Juefu</p>
<p>I spent a few months with several compatriots who were born in foreign countries. Silently observing their gentle temperament and elegant demeanor, I was reminded of another thing.</p>
<p>I remember when I was studying in elementary school, among my dozens of little companions, there were several children who were born overseas and had never been educated and influenced by the ancestral country of [the land of propriety and righteousness]. Their skin, hair, speech, and actions were no different from ours; but their temperament, temper, and attitude towards things were particularly different.</p>
<p>Because we are children, we don't do things very seriously and reasonably, this is a fact, but we don't do everything and immediately start fighting when we encounter something unfavorable to us. In our eyes, almost anything that is considered likely to cause danger or increase difficulty. Even if we know that we are being wronged, we mostly endure and retreat. However, these children who were born in foreign countries do not completely agree with us. No matter what you are doing or saying, as long as it offends them, no matter how much strength the other party has, they will eventually give you a good revenge before they can feel at ease and calm down. In the meantime, although they have also suffered many embarrassing counterattacks, their tough temperament and irritable temper have never been easily changed.</p>
<p>At that time, my age was very young, and of course I couldn't resist them in terms of strength, but being classmates with them and arguing and quarreling was unavoidable; therefore, after studying in elementary school for a few years, I don't know how many times I suffered from them. I still remember that every time I was wronged, I always ran to my mother with pain and tears to complain. After listening to my words, she often put on an angry face, half comforting me and half scolding them, saying:</p>
<p>[They are bastards, they are barbarians! Don't play with this group of people who don't understand etiquette in the future!]</p>
<p>[Barbarian], what a vicious term! Because I have suffered from their anger many times, the vicious term [barbarian] is firmly in my mind like the ugly face of a demon. After entering middle school, the bad impression that [barbarian] gave me has not faded at all, and there are indeed many [barbarians] among my classmates; however, there are not many who are as unreasonable as those in elementary school. Therefore, after spending a few years in middle school, I reluctantly got along with a few slightly satisfactory [barbarian] friends.</p>
<p>Now, I have been in college for a long time, here, if it weren't for the fact that time has passed for a long time, and I have gleaned some news from chatting with my classmates, and I wanted to identify those who are irritable and strong [barbarians] from their temperament and personality, it would be impossible; except for these few that I am familiar with, their temperament is just as kind, gentle, and honest as those of us who were born in the right way,... Silently thinking about these things, I deeply realized the greatness of the so-called [spiritual civilization] and [assimilation] that our compatriots often pride themselves on.</p>
<h3>[Society Is School]</h3>
<p>— Liao Zhi</p>
<p>The slogan [Society is School] has been promoted for a while in Europe and the United States, and has been realized, but in our country, there has not been much response. Originally, people are social animals and cannot live apart from society, and schools are a kind of group in society, and they cannot be independent of the circle of society. And the facts tell us that people's lives are progressing day by day. Relying solely on narrow school education to cope with the complex living environment is simply impossible. Therefore, caring educators see this shortcoming, know that simple school education is no longer sufficient to meet the needs of society, and expand the scope of schools, advocating [Society is School] to conform to the trend of this new era. Their original intention is to tear down the walls of the school and tell students to broaden their horizons and go to society to experience the practical life in various aspects, so that they can leave the school and join social groups to engage in activities in the future. From a practical and theoretical point of view, this should be regarded as a new education theory that is extremely in line with the times and worthy of our encouragement.</p>
<p>Our country's education is on the verge of bankruptcy, which is not an exaggeration. Although the major universities and middle and primary schools across the country have worked hard to produce batches of graduates every year, this is a considerable amount in terms of quantity, but in practice, these students who can be said to have completed their studies, once they leave the school and run into society, not only is what they have learned not used, but even the extremely simple social environment cannot be coped with. What is the reason for this? This is because our country's education has always separated schools and society too far. Their schools are their schools, and society is its society, and schools and society have become almost unrelated. Therefore, students are far away from social life, and they work hard in schools for several years. The knowledge and skills they get in the end, once they are moved into society for application, they will run into walls everywhere! The reason why there is such a lack of various talents in our society today, and the reason why a group of graduates have no way out, is nothing more than the result of this reason. This is the result that Chinese education has shown us today!</p>
<p>Therefore, for the sake of our country's education future, the current urgent task should first be to remove this layer of separation between schools and society, and integrate schools and society into one. Schools and society must be closely related. Schools must always pay attention to the changing situation of society, and society should provide schools with assistance in various ways, so that students can personally enter society to experience and acquire various practical knowledge in social life. Only in this way can we relieve one of the ills of Chinese education today.</p>

<h3>Suggestions for Our Middle School Readers</h3>
<p>We, the editors, are not very satisfied with today's middle school students because their lives still have many shortcomings. For example, male middle school students tend to be lazy, romantic, melancholic, have confused thoughts, and behave eccentrically. Female middle school students are often extravagant, don't study hard, and focus on appearance. These are all things we need to examine and rectify. Especially for the young students who have just entered middle school, you should be particularly strict with yourselves. Now, I will write down a few points that middle school students should pay attention to.</p>
<p>Grasp Your Environment and Understand the Purpose of Studying. Mechanical materialists have already shown us that the environment can control human beings. At the same time, dialectical materialism tells us that human beings can also transform the environment. The objective environment can determine our lives, so we should plant the seeds of creation, so that new environments can emerge from the old ones. Middle school students should pay attention to this point. In addition, what is the purpose of studying? I can answer simply: [Learning for application]. We must apply our knowledge to practical life, then we will not fail the mission of learning. The so-called [He who excels in study can follow an official career] is truly absurd.</p>
<p>Make Life Disciplined. A romantic life is most harmful to both body and spirit. Playing when you should be working, and working when you should be playing is a common problem. This should be changed. Live an absolutely disciplined life, that is, study hard when you are studying, and play hard when you are playing. This will not only benefit your physical health, but also greatly improve your study efficiency.</p>
<p>Develop a Strong Physique. The new explanation of the word "[genius]" is "[constant effort]". Effort requires a strong physique as its foundation. "[A sound mind in a sound body]" is such a wise saying. Mr. Cai Yuanpei once urged us to "[develop a physique like a lion]". If we want to study advanced knowledge, we need constant effort. To be able to make constant effort, we need a strong physique. How to develop it? By focusing on exercise.</p>
<p>Avoid Contact with the Opposite Sex. Most middle school students are between the ages of twelve and eighteen, which is the period of the most drastic physiological development and psychological changes. Reason is not yet fully developed, but emotions are very intense. There is a strong desire for the opposite sex. Therefore, if you occasionally come into contact with the opposite sex, you may inevitably fall in love and pursue them regardless of everything. As a result, you will inevitably make a mess of things, and you will completely forget about studying, and only know how to be with your lover every day.</p>
<p>Be Persistent and Humble. [Haste makes waste]. Learning is difficult to achieve quickly. So, what should we do? In my opinion, academic success comes from [accumulation], and the foundation of accumulation is persistence. If you are happy today, you will work hard and forget to eat, holding the book and reading it desperately. Once the interest is gone, you will put it on the shelf and ignore it for days. Such [spurts of diligence followed by long periods of laziness] will never be effective. Secondly, humility is also very important. Some young people, once they have achieved something, immediately boast about themselves, which is truly a fatal blow to their studies. We must not forget the wise saying [Pride invites loss, humility brings benefit].</p>
<p>Study More on Your Own Outside of Class. To be honest, as for school education, if you want to get abundant knowledge in the classroom, that is impossible. In the classroom, you can only get some knowledge of the doorway and tools. In other words, teachers can only point us in a direction. The long journey still needs to be walked by ourselves. Mr. Chen Dingmo once said in an article on research methods: [What we learn in school is only an overview of knowledge and methods of seeking knowledge]. This is absolutely right. If you want to enrich your knowledge, you still need to work hard on your own. Moreover, middle school students should pay more attention to one or two relatively specialized subjects, so that even if they cannot continue their studies after graduation, they will have a skill to make a living. This is especially needed in the current chaotic society, because objective facts have clearly shown us this.</p>

<h3>The Problem of Food and Lodging for Employees</h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I am from another place. Through the introduction of relatives, I came to work in the accounting department of a foreign firm in Shanghai. My monthly salary is twenty-two yuan, but it does not include food and lodging. (Lunch is provided, but it is not available on Sundays.)</p>
<p>When I first came to Shanghai, the person who introduced me helped me find food and lodging. He introduced me to stay temporarily at his relative's house, and I paid him seven yuan a month for food and lodging. I slept in the living room, which was set up at night and taken down in the morning. The living room was a thoroughfare, and they also played cards late at night, so I often couldn't sleep well. I had to find another way and consult with relatives and friends. However, the relatives with families did not have much spare room in their houses, and the friends were all clerks who ate other people's food and could not make decisions to let me stay for a long time (one or two months was possible). It was not cost-effective to pay for a meal, and even if I reluctantly paid for a meal, the restaurant was unwilling to deliver it. Therefore, both living and eating were major problems, especially living was the most difficult to solve. Because I couldn't borrow accommodation from others, I had to rent a house myself, but most of the houses in Shanghai [do not ask about families], and it is difficult for single people to rent. Therefore, I had to move my family to live in a cheap rental area. (Attic room in the city is eight yuan). However, my monthly income is only twenty-two yuan, how can I cover the expenses of clothing, food, housing, entertainment, etc.? If my wife goes out to work, there are two young children who cannot be left alone. Therefore, I have to go into debt every year for the sake of my job.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, in my situation, if I don't bring my family, I have no place to eat and live. If I bring my family, I don't have enough to spend and I have to go into debt. Isn't it more painful to have a job! But if I quit my job, how can my family sit and eat at home, plus it's a matter of reputation; if I look for another job, it's even more difficult! Therefore, I have been worried every day since I came to Shanghai because of the problem of food and lodging, and there is no solution. Now I see in the newspaper that</p>
<p>You can solve difficult problems for people, so I specially send a letter with the details, and please provide guidance and answers as soon as possible. I beg you,</p>
<p>Sincerely, Yu Ruisheng</p>
<p>Editor's note: This is a problem that is very easy to solve, and at the same time, it is a problem that has no solution at all. Because if your income is very high, then clothing, food, and housing can all be satisfactory, so how could such a problem arise? Therefore, the center of the problem is not the inability to solve the problem of clothing, food, and housing, but the economic difficulty. The income cannot meet the expenses. According to your monthly income, it is already very difficult to maintain a personal life, let alone support a family. Therefore, your so-called [food and lodging problem] is the entire living problem. The best solution for individuals to this problem is to increase income, but the society is full of unemployment. It is really [easier said than done] to find a job with a higher salary. Therefore, this problem cannot be solved by individual efforts.</p>
<p>Then, should we just wait to die and starve to death? No! No! Absolutely not! We must not succumb to the difficulty of knowing how to live and the harshness of the environment. Instead, we must fight to create a new environment and a new life, and fight to the death!</p>
<p>How do we create a new environment and a new life? Regarding this, we can answer: the difficult situation you are suffering is not just your individual problem, but the pain that everyone who lives on a salary feels. This kind of pain cannot be eliminated by individual efforts alone. Instead, people who share this pain need to unite and study the origins of this pain together, think of ways to relieve this pain, and at the same time work together to implement solutions to this difficulty. Only in this way can your difficulties be resolved; otherwise, we are just like you, with no solution to this problem.</p>
<p>The answer we have given to this letter is just a general direction for solving the problem. As for specific methods, we hope that readers will come up with them for public discussion. The reason why we want to publish this letter is that although this problem is currently impossible to solve in society, it is the most serious problem for ordinary people. Therefore, we hope that people who care about social problems or the future of society will pay close attention to this problem; at the same time, we hope that people who are personally experiencing this difficulty will carefully consider this problem and come up with a solution.</p>

<p>— Man Zhi</p>
<p>I went to your house the next afternoon. This time, you probably thought I was a regular visitor, so you didn't ask me to sit on the cold bench in the living room. You welcomed me into your room. Although I remembered what happened last time, I didn't think much about it and sat down in the room. I like to play Go. I invited you to the round table to play Go. You agreed, but your thin face was like the clear blue sky of autumn, covered with a gray cloud. Although I thought you must have something unhappy on your mind, how could I ask you directly? Although I was playing Go, I wasn't happy; and you were fighting aimlessly, and finally couldn't finish the game and sighed!</p>
<p>You started by saying, [Yesterday, you and Renjie went to see a play and drink alcohol. He also went to the Jai Alai court and lost all his money before coming back. You are his old friend, and you should advise him!]</p>
<p>This was a complaint from the wife to the husband's old friend! I was shocked! You should have seen the surprise in my eyes then, right?</p>
<p>I said, [Yesterday, we went to see [Grand Hotel], and then went to [Jie Er Jing] to eat. He said he went to the Jai Alai court to relax, and I also advised him not to be so decadent.]</p>
<p>You said, [He has been really decadent lately. Since living with me, there hasn't been a day without a quarrel. He's probably decadent because he lives with me. I really don't want to harm him and let him continue to be decadent!]</p>
<p>[He's too ungrateful to me,] you said, tears streaming down your face and your voice choked up. [You probably know that he was with Lu Bixia before, right? He treated Lu Bixia so well, whatever she said was what she got. Her words were like God's commands; how does he treat me? No matter how much I advise him, my words are like wind blowing past his ears! In the past year, all the royalties or school salaries he received were sent to the Jai Alai court. Every time I advise him not to throw money into the sea like that, he doesn't listen at all, as if he's drunk, and has no reason at all. He also likes to drink alcohol, at least three or four bottles at a time, and no matter how much you advise him, you can't bring him back. He often laughs coldly or loudly abnormally after drinking. I asked him if he had any worries or troubles in his heart, but he didn't say anything. He's like a madman. He's obviously worried and troubled in his heart, but he doesn't tell me. How can I know what he's worried about? In this way, I comforted him, but I don't know which words can truly comfort his heart. I'm living a worried and uneasy life. I'm worried and uneasy for him, but I can't show my worries and unease in front of him. How can I live on?</p>
<p>[The mental pain is like this, and he doesn't care about the material things either. Look at the room, which is a mess. He doesn't even pay for sofa covers. The clothes I wear are all old, and the rent is two months overdue. He keeps saying he has a solution, but where will the solution come from? When he was with Lu Bixia, I heard from friends that Lu Bixia had a suit made today and two cheongsams made tomorrow. Let's not talk about that, he doesn't even care about himself, and he needs someone to take care of him. He's really too ungrateful to me!</p>
<p>[Moreover, we often quarrel, and he takes out his anger on me. Am I something to be vented on? …I can't take it anymore!]</p>
<p>You said angrily and sadly. At that time, I found it difficult to say anything. I sympathized with your suffering, but I could also forgive Renjie's willfulness; moreover, what can a third party say about a couple's affairs? If I say you're wrong, you'll definitely be unhappy. If I say he's wrong, you'll scold me in the future, even tomorrow, when you're in love. So, at that time, I sympathized with your suffering, and I didn't speak ill of Renjie. Do you remember? At that time, I just sighed and said,</p>
<p>[Renjie has been deeply stimulated recently, and he's going down the road of decadence!]</p>
