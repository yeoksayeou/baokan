<p>時評</p>
<h3>二十三年度我國歲出入概算案之觀察</h3>
<p>— 經</p>
<p>一週前報載。民國二十三年財政年度之國家收支概算。經國府主計處編製。擬定歲入總額爲八一五·九一五·OOO元。歲出總額爲九一八·六八五·四五七元。計入不敷出者。約一O二·七七O·四五七元續據十五日中央社電訊。則主計處巳將二十三年度國家總槪算編製完竣。送中政會核議。審其內容歲入方面之重要項目。如關鹽統稅等已較上年度大有增加惟歲出方面之債務支出。則未見相當减少。茲爲便於研究起見特將本年度擬定之重要收支科目。與二十二年度概算額相比較。列表如後。（單位百萬元）</p>
<p>科目　　　　　　二十二年度　　　　　二十三年度關稅　　　　　　　三五四元　　　　　　三六O元鹽稅　　　　　　　一四六元　　　　　　一九O元統稅　　　　　　　　九七元　　　　　　一一O元印花烟酒税　　　　　三六元　　　　　　　三五元債務費　　　　　　二四一元　　　　　　二五O元　　此次主計處編造之國家歲出入總概算。雖猶有待於中政會作最後之决定。然旣經一番研究。當必格外精密。故頗足爲吾人觀察目前中央財政狀况之參考。其間足資吾人深刻注意者。凡有數事。（一）目前中央財政之最大困難厥爲經常之收入不足供經常之支出。因是非每年增發公債二三萬萬元不爲功。試觀自十六年度至二十一年度之間。增發公債達十一億左右。卽二十二年度內。亦舉債至二億六千萬元之巨。此皆由於歷年財政當局偏重於公債政策。有以致之獨此次主計處之總概算。則顯有趨向於增稅政策之意味。如鹽稅收入。擬增五千萬元。統稅收入。擬增二千萬元。關稅收入。擬增六百萬元。皆爲明徵。此不能謂非財政政策上之一大轉變也。（二）當此中央財政經常收入不敷甚巨之際。唯一合理之救濟辦法。尙在於節流。而開源次之。今據現狀以言。若謂二十三年年度之經常支出。將較上年度大爲節省似難辦到。蓋各省剿匪軍事與海陸空軍軍備之所需。未必有减縮之望。而債務費之支出且明明較上年度增加一千餘萬元。增稅政策。推行過速。勢必引起私運與走漏。結果恐亦未足以彌縫經常收支之差額。茍不切實講究節約。必無補於國家財政之前途。此次主計處之歲出總概算中似。尙未能發揮此點之眞諦。（三）歷年財政支出。用於生產建設事業者。遠不及用於他事之多。試一檢視二十三年度之概算。軍費與債務之負擔。仍佔總支出百分之八十。足見國家財政。一時尙不易整理也。</p>
<p>最後就國民經濟之立塲言。增稅政策之結果。國內工商業必感不利。而國家不生產事業支出之膨脹。亦足間接影響於工商業。然則今日編製二十三年度之總概算。而欲求所以「今勝於昔。」豈非難之事乎。</p>

<h3>意德兩揆會談結束　成立妥協四點　共同維持奧大利獨立　德返國聯問題獲諒解　希特勒一行昨飛返柏林</h3>
<p>威尼斯　意相墨索里尼與德總理希特勒已成立重要外交妥恊、承認奧國獨立、亦在其內、該妥恊以四點爲根據、</p>
<p>（一）普通性質之妥協包括兩國當軸時常親自會晤及公文往來在內</p>
<p>（二）承認奧國獨立、惟雙方均未作何擔保、德國則允不輔助恐怖主義之活動、</p>
<p>（三）德國表示願重返國聯、惟須承認其享有軍備均等之充分權利</p>
<p>（四）對於振興多瑙河各國貿易之諒解、意見脗合、關於第二項之妥恊根據、爲德國對意志願之讓步、以換取關於國聯與軍縮之現局、（十五日路透電）</p>
<h3>墨索里尼　對六萬人演說</h3>
<p>意德會晤在謀政治上團結　　冀廓淸歐洲陰霾避免慘刧　　非欲改變地圖使益增紊亂今日午後意相墨索里尼出現於聖瑪克街宮廊下、對六萬人演說、用放聲器傳達其演詞、聽者歡呼不置、其言曰、「希特勒與余會晤、並非欲改製歐洲地圖、亦不欲使憔悴世界愈增阢隉吾人之會晤、不過欲設法消除歐洲生活之陰霾、避免慘刧、並覔取至低程度之政治上團結、茍無此則歐洲前途必陷於衰落云（十五路透電）</p>
<h3>意外次發聲明　兩國政治問題　成立完全諒解</h3>
<p>威尼斯意外次蘇維區今日聲稱、上述妥恊、可表示兩國總揆之心理、德國終將放棄德奧合併之謀、雙方並無對於任何一點成立切實恊定之意、此次會晤之最大關係、厥爲一種諒解、可以成立之感想云、（十五日路透電）</p>
<p>威尼斯　意國外交次長蘇維區今日向報界發表德總理希特勒與意首相墨索里尼會議歐洲緊要問題、所得决議之大綱稱、兩政治家對於有關德意兩國之國際問題、一致主張共同合作、意國對於德國在國　　應享平等權利一層、表示贊同、惟不願首先提議請德重返國聯、致於奧國之獨立問題、意德兩國之意見、以前稍有不同、此次亦經詳細討論、希特勒及墨索里尼二氏均以爲奧國應維持獨立、並須草擬一種一般的而非區間的恊定、使奧國境內可以保持和平、對於軍縮問題、二政治家亦議有結果、惟詳細情形未曾發表、蘇維區氏接見報界之時、在墨索里尼氏檢閱泛擊黨前鋒及靑年團之後、墨氏檢閱畢後、卽向廣塲中九萬人演說云、（十六日國民社電）</p>
<h3>德揆飛返柏林　墨索里尼親自送行</h3>
<p>威尼斯　德國總理希特勒於今晨八點十分飛回德國、七點十分卽自寓邸啓程、經過聖馬克宮、停車參觀歷二十分鐘、卽赴飛機塲、意相墨索里尼巳在塲迎候、希特勒當與墨索里尼行泛繫黨敬禮、兩人嗣又握手、有步騎砲兵混合隊一隊在塲歡送、並奏兩國國歌、希特勒與外長牛拉脫同乘第一飛機、其餘德國代表乘第二飛機、第三飛機則載乘德國警察人員、沿途保護、至八點十五分、飛機向北飛去、不見踪影、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（柏林）希特勒及其隨員、已於今晨九時五十分由威尼斯飛抵慕尼黑、再由慕尼黑轉乘火車遄返柏林、（十六日國民社電）</p>
<h3>意首相將赴德報聘</h3>
<p>（柏林）柏林午報登載引人注意之威尼斯電訊、謂希特勒總理曾面邀意相墨索里尼赴德國一游、墨索里尼自秉政後、從未出國門一步、但聞此次或將破例、赴德國報希特勒之聘云、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>談話廣泛未訂文件</h3>
<p>墨索里尼與希特勒先在列杜戈爾夫俱樂部晤談約二小時、後乘小輪出游、仍繼續談話、據德人方面消息、談話係普通性質、所涉頗廣、並未簽定任何文件、羅馬人士謂此次妥恊、爲兩國總揆之個人訂交、至於實在政治問題、猶在其次、兩國間並未簽定任何文件、此說現已徵實、（十五日路透電）</p>
<h3>德返國聯尙有問題</h3>
<p>威尼斯　衆信兩揆談話之結果、未必立卽發生影響、但在政治進行中有普遍之勢力、因兩國意見彼此較前更爲明晰也、聞目前未有德國重返國聯問題、其故因軍縮事件現尙未有切實之解决也、（十五日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）關於意相墨索里尼與德總揆希特勒之會晤此間尙未接到正式報告、英國政界以爲意德當局交換意見、目下尙未得到任何結果、一般人對兩巨頭之會晤、能否眞正成功、頗爲懐疑、尤以關於德國重返日內瓦一　爲甚、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>反對集團對峙制度</h3>
<p>威尼斯　據半官方面聲稱、希特勒與墨索里尼會晤之舉、在數星期以前業經雙方决定、而希特勒之接受邀請、决於十四日前往威尼斯、則在其啓程之前三日始發通知、似乎在會晤之前數日間、德國尙有所躊躇、甚或德國對於何項問題可以爲會談之目的、亦曾提出條件、而以雙方會談之問題、應具有整個歐洲之意義、而不僅以德意兩國問關係爲限、溯自德國脫離日內瓦以後、法德兩國已不復有接獨之機會、意大利乃願爲兩國間之媒介、使兩國重歸於好、然意大利亦與德國具有同見以爲欲拉攏德法、當以歐洲之意義爲本、如有從局部之結合、行集團之政策者、則所反對、緣就多瑙河問題而論、三月十五日在羅馬締結之意奧匃恊定、始終門戶洞開、封德國然、對願意加入之其他列强亦然也、威尼斯城之會談、雙方均反對局部集團政策、至修改和約問題、則未經提及、而奧國獨立之當予維持、則爲意大利所提出之眞正條約云、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>四國公約未經提及</h3>
<p>意德邦交因此次兩雄之談話、而愈見密切、彼等共同政策、在避免各國中互相集團對峙之制度、而四國公約則未經述及、此節殊可視爲重要、蓋四國人公約乃意國外交政策中之最扼要的理論、該公約成立之幕後主旨、卽在阻止法德各自集團以自固也、聞德意兩國仍抱同一意見、願與其他各國相互合作、（十五日路透電）</p>
<h3>私人友誼繼續維持</h3>
<p>今日深夜當局方面始有消息公佈、內稱「意大利首相與德國總理今日以至誠懇合作之精神繼續討論歐洲普通問題、及兩國間之關係、並加以結束、而兩國總揆間所已成立之私人友誼、此後將繼續永存」云云（十五日國民電）</p>
<h3>希特勒與意王換電　互以增進褔利相勉</h3>
<p>希特勒今日電致意王申其敬忱、並希望渠與意相之會晤、可增進意德之福利、與世界之和平意王後卽電覆、表示同一希望、（十五日路透電）</p>
<h3>意德報紙同聲贊揚</h3>
<p>羅馬　此間官報對於希特勒總理意國之行贊稱、希特勒與墨索里尼之會晤、將予全歐以和平云、講壇報宣稱、歐洲復興之基礎不在日內瓦、而須於墨索里尼首相之創造中求之、希特勒與墨索里尼巳發生淵源、將來定有效果云、意大利日報稱、意德兩革命國家之精神關係、不僅努力恢復兩國之主義與福利、並將恢復各民族之關係、其目標在造成一比較公正自由及均衡之歐局云、法西斯黨前秘書長法倫西在其機關報宣稱、同爲建設國家之德意兩大國、深覺歷史所賦予彼等之責任、故决定共同檢討國際之局勢、擁護彼等者非國會、而係兩國人民、此次會議將產生有利於歐洲和平之實質結果、而此結果則决非各國所視爲崇尙空論無補實際之會議所能產生也、（十六日國民電）</p>
<p>（柏林）德國報紙對於希特勒總理與墨索里尼首相在斯特拉之會議、一致表示滿意、某報今晨代表官方發表正確之意見稱、墨索里尼與希特勒會議之結果、一種係心理作用、墨索里尼與希特勒現巳樹立彼此關係、國家社會主義及法西斯主義今巳謀面、德意兩國國民亦已促進兩國之友誼、此於兩國及歐洲和平有莫大之關係、惟有從此基礎、始能產生新效果云、國家社會黨報紙表示希特勒總理採行面談辦法、與以前之外交方法、顯然不同、且一再向法國表示修好、法國政府則加以拒絕、法國遂不惜遷怒於此次斯特拉會議、而表示懐疑、德國報紙今晨詳載墨索里尼女壻齊亞諾之談話稱、德國於平等實現後、立卽重返日內瓦、及樹立奧國與德國之正常關係、於奧國獨立一點觀之、實爲奧國所歡迎云、（十六日國民電）</p>
<h3>法報記者無處問津</h3>
<p>（巴黎）法國報界派遣大批記者前往威尼斯、希望傳達希特勒及墨索里尼會議之消息、然得不償失、蓋所得消息、僅屬表面文章、談話內容則披露者甚少、法報記者旣無問津之處、於是遂出其幻想憶測、而認此項會議純由法國荒謬之外交政策所造成云、（十六日國民電）</p>
<h3>墨索里尼心神不寗　由古邸移宿旅社</h3>
<p>今夜希特勒宴墨索里尼於大旅社一璧柴尼古邸雖經修葺、以供意相稅駕、但墨氏顯因神經不寗、昨夜改宿列杜之高尙旅社、聞者皆以爲異其以璧柴尼邸有鬼怪出現乎、按一百四十年前拿翁購置此邸僅宿一夜後卽聲稱、永不居此、兩總揆在大旅社聚餐後、分乘汽車至高尙旅社、談笑甚歡、並觀貴族之跳舞、希氏直至夜間十一時四十分始返大　社就寢、（十五日路透電）</p>
<h3>法國防經費案　通過衆院　總額三十一萬萬佛郎　用於邊防及海空擴軍</h3>
<p>（巴黎）衆議院已將國防經費案、予以通過、計陸海空三部總數爲三·一二O·OOO·OOO佛郎、分配如下、（一）邊境防禦工程一·二七五·OOO·OOO佛郎、分兩年支出、（二）建築流質燃料儲藏所·整理海岸防務·及充實海軍所屬之飛機隊等共八六五·OOO·OOO佛郎、在一九三四年至一九二八年預算中、陸續支出、（三）實行空軍軍器及配備計畫、其九八OOOO·OOO佛郎、由一九三四年預算中支出、全案由衆院以四二O票對一七一票之多數通過、當討論時、有人對軍額問題發表意見、總理杜邁格剴切答復、謂政府對於現行軍事法律、必以光明態度、予以施行、凡關於軍額及兵役期限等事項、不得國會同意、决不有所變更、卽在國會休假期內、亦不擅自行動云、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>海軍預備會議　日重視法態度　美代表將由法赴英</h3>
<p>（南京）海軍軍縮之預備會議、意大利亦將參加、所餘者祇法國一國、外務當局以爲法國之參加與否、對於明年之軍縮會議影響甚大、故甚重視、並對於法國之立塲、觀測如下、（一）依華府條約、法國所受限制者爲主力艦與航空母艦、對於補助艦並不受拘束、故法國之目的、係在凌駕意大利·西班牙之海軍兵力、因此或將發出警告、不與英美日同、皆受限制、（一）最近法國因英國傾向意大利與德國、頗不以爲然、且因明年之軍縮會議、恐德國將參加其間、故此次不參加預備會議、（一）法國希望由國聯達到軍縮目的、因五大海軍國之會議、自身主張、將遭英美壓迫、若由國聯則法國可利用小國、以貫澈其主張、（十六日電通電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）蘇聯駐法大使館參贊羅珊培爾、昨由日內瓦返此、今日外長巴爾都予以延見、巴氏又曾會見軍縮會議美國代表台維斯、討論軍縮會議工作情形、台氏不日卽將赴英、參加一九三五年海軍會議之初步談話、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>莫斯科報之觀察</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）關於下届海軍會議業已開始談判、伊斯維斯太報對此加以評論云、自華盛頓及倫敦妥洽恊定成立而後、國際局面巳起堅决之變化、近年來遠東事態之發展、顯示英日在政治上之密切聯繫、彼等之問雖仍有尖銳之矛盾、唯此並未抺煞美國陷於孤立以及無望恢復「華盛頓會議精神」之事實、海軍軍備問題决不能以孤立之方式視之、倫敦方面之談判、必以太平洋之政治問題爲骨幹、正猶日內瓦談判之不出歐洲安全問題也、夫華盛頓恊定爲九國對華政治恊定中不可分之部份、唯此項恊定、已爲日本在亞洲大陸週知之侵略行動撕毀凈盡、而新海軍恊定之締結、必有其任何形式之政治前提爲之先導也、現時情勢實爲空前之難局在任何塲合佔下届海軍會議之中心地位者、必非軍事與技術問題、而爲一般政治問題、必非軍備問題而爲安全問題、故該項會議殊不能限於倫敦初步談判所擬定之偏狹方面云、（十五日塔斯電）</p>
<h3>溥儀赴日　含糊其辭</h3>

<h3>德人震驚</h3>
<p>宣傳部長戈培爾波蘭之行、結果良好、德國報紙大爲滿意、不料戈氏甫離波京、而波蘭內長畢拉基忽以被刺聞、德國輿論因之大爲掃興、柏林交易所日報謂「畢拉基爲坦白主張波德携手之一人、此次暴徒行兇、舉世爲之震動矣、仇恨分子一日不除、則民族間永無和平之日」云、該報以爲此次暗殺、係無政府主義者所爲、宣傳部長戈培爾與外長牛賴脫均巳致電波蘭政府致唁、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>繼威爾斯會議之後　德揆將訪但澤　與畢蘇資基會見　戈爾培預作先容　　德波邦交有調整必要　波內長遇刺恐受影響</h3>
<p>（柏林）波蘭內務部長畢拉基被刺殞命消息、傳至此間、德國政界極爲震驚、此次宣傳部長戈培爾遊歷波蘭、一般人原望此行能使波蘭輿論及主政者方面發生良好印象、藉以促進兩國邦交、現畢氏被刺、此種期望恐受妨害矣、昨日戈培爾與波蘭軍政部長畢爾蘇斯基會晤之後、德國政界若干人士盛言此事在政治上關係之重大、按波德兩國趨於接近、確以戈氏之功居多、國社主義之德國與波蘭接近、至有利益一層、戈氏早巳見及、故力求兩國之聯絡、最近波蘭新聞記者來德遊歷、歡迎儀節盛大無比、皆戈氏所主持、戈氏在波蘭備受優待、其情形誠有如德國報紙所道者、顧戈培爾此次赴波蘭、重在與畢爾蘇斯基上將相晤、設不晤畢氏而返、則其任務卽未完全成功、據若干人推測、戈氏此行、係爲希特勒總理與畢爾蘇斯基之曾晤、預爲接洽、希氏旣往意大利會晤墨索里尼、則其與「新交」之波蘭當局會晤、亦爲德國政治中應有之文章、一般人又謂、希特勒與墨索里尼會談之後、時局恐有變動、故德國與波蘭邦交、更有迅速整理之必要、波蘭前爲轉移國社黨政府向外發展之方向起見、曾一度求與德國互相提携、乃與德國訂立十年互不侵犯之恊定、今意德兩國總揆正在威尼斯談話、結果對於奧國問題成立妥恊非不可能、妥恊果成、則波蘭外交地位實際上大可回至波德互不侵犯恊定未訂立以前之情况、此層至爲可慮、希特勒與畢爾蘇斯基會晤之所以關係重大以及戈培爾之所以認此事爲主要任務者、其故以此、戈氏抵華沙後、畢爾蘇斯基原有染病不見客之說、厥後突告霍然、此與上述種種大約不無關係、此間有人謂、希特勒與畢爾蘇斯基之會晤、在原則上業已决定、並有擇定但澤爲相晤地點之說、所未定者僅日期而已、戈培爾任務方終、而波蘭內長畢拉基突然被刺、兩首領會面計劃、是否因此推翻、則不得而知矣、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>德國停債問題</h3>

<h3>浙茶滯銷原因　培植製造墨守舊法　國外銷路大受打擊　日本侵奪東北市塲　茶業損失六百餘萬</h3>
<p>杭州通信、浙省茶葉爲出產大宗、年達四十餘萬担、除湘鄂兩省外、佔全國第三位、惟因製法不知改良、受日印各國茶葉之傾軋、國外銷路大遭打擊、營業日益衰落、當局已在準備着手改良、記者昨晤區農塲技術主任吕允福、談茶業現狀及改進各點甚詳、爰擇要紀之如下、</p>
<p>栽培不良、浙省七十五縣、產茶區域有六十二縣、佔全省五分之四以上、栽培面積、共計五十二萬三千三百三十六畝、其中紹興一縣已有二十四萬畝、尙餘十三縣、氣候土質、亦無不宜植茶、如加以擴充、全省茶地至少可達一百萬畝、（產量）浙省產茶旣多、上年經實業部派員調查統計、共產四十二萬六千三百四十二担、惟每畝茶地的產量平均僅八十斤左右、少收時每畝有不滿二十斤者、與印·鍚·日本·同樣面積相較、誠覺瞠乎其後、（裁法、浙茶多數栽於高山、俗稱高山茶平地桑、實則茶樹栽於高山、香味固佳、而產量决不能與印鍚平地茶爭雄也、是以茶樹不限植於高山、平地斜坡均可種植、栽茶多用點播、不如改用條播、產量自可增加（間作）植茶農民、類多以茶爲副業、茶地每間作其他作物、溫州一帶、多用蕃薯間作、紹興一帶用玉蜀黍小麥等、平水一帶更用竹間作、杭州龍井則與桑間作、致茶量减少、間作固非絕對不可、惟作物須加選擇、免影響茶之本身耳、（肥料）杭州龍井一帶茶樹、多施人糞菜餅等肥料、故產量較多、茶質殊嫩、溫州雖不施肥、每年培土一次、紹興之平水區、旣不施肥又不培土、每年採摘三四次、地力消耗大而產量日見减少、（更新）更新係每隔二三年除去老枝、使樹勢復原、杭州附近及溫州一帶、隔數年着地砍去一次、地力消耗大而生產受其影響、最佳更新方法爲剪枝、頭茶後、將特別高枝剪去、使樹形一律採摘便利、產量自增（採摘）採茶多爲女工、因向無訓練、且以重量計算工資、故以多採爲目的、老茶硬枝、每多摻人、製造時多費人工、品質因之低劣、能規定一律以三四芽時採摘爲最妥、（蟲害）各地茶園、病葉甚多、蓋有蛅嘶避債蟲等爲害、在紹興方面爲尤烈、去冬茶樹因寒風霜害而枯死者亦極鉅病蟲害者、亦茶業問題中所應急於防治者　　攙僞濫造　浙省製造茶葉、不論初製再製、均用人工値茶忙時、每出高價亦不易覓得製茶工人、茶葉任其老硬、出產因之减少、成本反爲增高、爲節省人工减輕成本計、將來非全部或一部份的採用機械不可、關於茶葉之製造、大概如下、（製法）茶葉品種原無紅綠之分、但市售茶葉種類不下數百種、均屬製法之不同、綠茶製法、大</p>
<p>致分（一）殺靑、（二）搓揉、（三）乾燥（四）篩揀、（五）裝箱、紅茶分（一）凋萎、（二）搓揉、（三）醱酵、（四）乾燥、（五）篩揀、（六）裝箱等、殺靑用鍋炒法、搓揉用手揉或脚踏、頗不衛生、紅茶醱酵因設備不周、不若用科學方法之均勻、乾燥有用日光者、茶之香氣遂减少矣、（着色）因採摘製造方法之不合科學、茶葉顏色多不正確、茶商每用義記·黃三·魚黃靛靑等有毒顏料着色、美英法俄各國、先後禁止進口、實華茶所受之致命傷、嗣茶商將着色茶銷售於文化程度較低之非洲澳洲、近復爲非澳抵制、（攙假）數十年前、外人歡迎華茶、價格增高、供不應求、浙省茶農、乃異想天開、採摘山間野生植物葉芽、混入眞茶、以獲厚利、嗣爲外人檢騐發覺、眞正華茶亦被拒購、茶業遂一落千丈、現溫州平陽南北港·騰蚊堡·山門等地、每年尙有假茶六千担、（土人美其名曰大茶、假葉成分百分之十至百分之六十、最普通的爲紅柴心·油茶·柳葉與滿山靑·）由古鰲頭運出、銷售於國內各地、故現溫州茶葉、不論眞假、價値每担僅二三十元、甚至十餘元、做假茶者尙堪維持、做眞茶者反遭虧本、他如攙滑石·墨煤·漿糊·水等弊端孔多、品質惡劣、國際市塲、華茶之不能與他國竸爭者、職是故也、</p>
<p>捐稅奇重　浙省交通、日臻發達、茶業頗有發展希望、惟汽車運費過昂、不合經濟、政府應减輕出品貨運費、挽救破產之農村經濟、（銷路）近年華茶銷路停滯、紅茶尤甚、其原因（一）受印錫日本茶之傾軋、（二）品質過劣、（三不注意宣傳、（四）成本過高、欲推廣銷路、須從此四點着手、（成本）栽茶成本頗少、製造成本須加一倍、是以每担成本十元之茶業、運滬售與外商、須得價四五十元、方不致虧本、茶商受買辦階級之剝削、壓低茶價、茶販則向茶農剝削、茶農無法、祇得粗放其栽培方法而不投資、（稅捐）茶農有地稅、茶棧有資本捐·營業稅·敎育捐·慈善捐等、出品關稅雖已免除、但尙有所謂報關費碼頭捐等、卽飲茶亦有茶碗捐、捐稅不一而足、負擔奇重、爲茶業衰落之一大原因、</p>
<p>統制改良、浙省茶業之病狀旣已明瞭、方能對症下藥、達到增加生產、改良品類、推廣銷路之三大目的、欲逹此目的、須實現栽培科學化、製造機械化、運銷合理化三項方針、根據方針、擬具具體辦法、（茶塲、籌設省辦茶塲、直屬農業改良總塲、地點在杭州附近留下四鄕等茶區內其使命爲（一）試騐改良方法、（二）訓練茶業專才、（三）爲全省茶業改良中心、紹溫二區各設一分塲、寗波永嘉等地各設立一精茶廠、（人才）訓練推廣人才、（一）派農業推廣人員赴贛皖茶業改良塲實習、期滿回省服務、（二）省辦茶塲招收練習生、期滿派赴各產茶區指導、（統制）實行統制政策、劃定舊溫州府屬爲紅茶區、舊寗紹台府屬爲平水綠茶區、杭湖區爲龍井綠茶區、金衢嚴處爲茶墾區、其栽培面積、產茶數量茶葉種類、及栽培製造運輸、均受有計劃之統制、凋敝之浙茶業、或有復興希望、</p>
<p>衰落現狀　記者復晤杭市茶業領袖某君、據稱、杭州爲產茶著名區域、每届春令、北平·天津·靑島·南京·上海各帮茶商、雲集於此、浙皖兩省之産茶縣份如浙之淳安·建德·分水、皖之徽州·屯溪·祁門·等縣茶農、多數運杭求售、各茶行則僅收佣金、代茶農與各帮茶客接洽成交、而尤以東北四省銷路最大、自九一八以後、日僞卽抽收値百抽三十之茶葉進口稅、一面將台灣日茶、儘量輸入東北、以資替代、奪取華茶市塲、最近復擬增稅、故浙茶受絕大損失、如東北未被日本佔領時、杭地一隅、茶葉營業、年約八九百萬元、去年僅三百萬元、本年春茶已告落令、營業不過共百七八十萬元、衰落之狀、可見一斑、（十五日）</p>

<h3>桂省經濟調查印象記（續）</h3>
<p>— 千家駒</p>
<p>但在密戶中，商人資本猙獰的面目又出現了，因爲他們的資本都很短少，每至春夏之交，往往要向碗行借點錢做資本，想定將來以燒好的瓷器歸還，這種借貸名義上雖不取利息，但當、以貸還債時，價錢要比市價便宜得多，大約每一筒碗要納息銅元二枚至五枚，這種剝削也是比高利貸還要利害的，因爲一筒碗的總値還不過三四十個銅仙，這種放債在蘆墟極爲普遍，據我們的調查，蘆墟碗行放債數額，多者達一萬餘元，少者亦一二千元，高利貸在其中的活躍情形，也就可想而知了，</p>
<p>去了賓陽後，我又出發到龍州去，邑龍公路全長六百三十里，是廣西省道中最壞的一條，途中顚簸跳蕩，非常人所能堪，我們同行的五六個人，嘔吐的幾一大半，我們眞不解，爲什麼這麼重要的一條公路，路面不加修理而聽令這樣敗壞呢，</p>
<p>龍州地據　江上游及廣源（卽牧馬河又名高平河）七源（七溪河）二河之下游，縣境西部，與安南犬牙相錯，關隘車重，實乃邊防重鎭，雖然目前我們毫無國防之足言，當宋皇祐六年，趙鼎隨狄靑征蠻有功，世襲斯土，稱爲覊縻龍州，清時爲　治，隸大平府，民國二年，改爲龍州縣，因其爲西南邊僻之區，而在國防上又占重要地位、現邊防督辦公署卽設於此），故頗爲一般人所重視，無論就牠的氣候，物產，風俗習慣，經濟生活上說，龍州都是一個特別有趣味的區域，這地方，多暑少寒，雖在嚴冬，亦不過地降微霜，每當晨曦初上，山谷之間，冒有烟霧，卽所謂（瘴氣）者是，所以龍州人有俗話說，（勿起早，勿吃飽，勿討小，）因爲（起早）容易遇到烟瘴，，（吃飽）易致病。（討小）則怕討着安南女子做姨太太，引起了國籍問題，他們又說，（不住上二十年算不得龍州人），這也是極言龍州水土難服，外地人去住容易致病的緣故，</p>
<p>龍州的風土習慣，有的是特別値得我們注意的，婦女喜帶脚鐲，赤足，更喜染牙爲黑色，其法以蔞葉和熟烟石灰及血藤之類咀嚼之，這些都還不脫原始民族的生活，至男子好飲酒而恥言生產，是以（怠惰）著稱的人民，但是這，由我們看來，倒不見得是他們的本性好懶，因爲他們終年勤勞的結果，往往不夠一飽，所以樂得（得過且過，不事生產）了，在農村中龍州地主的剝削也較別處爲甚，這裏有一種最奇異的制度，卽田賦由佃戶負担是，大概全縣之中，佃戶納糧的要占二分之一，我問他們糧賦旣由佃戶擔負，佃租是否減輕呢，他們說不，這還是一樣的，所以據邊務機要學校有一位兵要地理調查員告訴過我，（農民往往一到三四月就沒有糧食，這我們最初怎麼也不信，到後來經實地調查後，才知道這才是的的確確的情形，）</p>
<p>當民十八時，龍州曾一度被兪作豫的紅軍所占領，經過了半年，官軍才把牠收復了，他們當時組織了一個左江革命委員會，共有槍五六百支，但紅軍的影響在龍州似乎並不嚴重，除了下凍地方燒燬過一次田契及向商民勒索巨欵外，此外別無動作，也組織過（蘇維埃政府，）主席卽縣長兼任？），後以共黨宣傳抗捐抗稅，縣政府無欵可收，兩者遂形對立，當廣西政府軍隊開到時，他們還以爲是本地的土匪軍呢，</p>
<p>龍州有幾種特別有名的特產，第一就是（蛤蚧），乃一種形狀酷肖壁虎的爬虫，用以侵酒，據說可以補血治肺癆，但我們初看到的人，却總覺得飲蛤蚧酒有些可怕似的，第二是桄榔粉，以桄榔樹春碎，取粉製成，形色氣味，與藕粉無異，但亦可治紅白痢水瀉等等病症，至於肉桂與八角（卽茴香），大部分却是安南的產品（八角龍州出產年亦達數十萬斤），此外如鷄皮果，洗手果，蝴蝶果，史君子，唵咘李，血籐，跳子（產上下凍（據說採掇時，拍樹呼其名，則殼自裂而子跳出，故名跳子，其說無稽，不足置信，）追，風蛇，金色銀，（均毒蛇，侵酒可驅風濕），等等，不一而足，這裏的（水土），亦較別處稍有不同，所以還有許多奇突的病症，爲我們所不了解的，最奇異的就是龍州人傳說的所謂（鷄鬼症），據說病者因中鷄鬼，神經反常，言不由衷，每天要吃生鷄鷄血及香蕉等物，如不急治，半月內可致死命，有專藏一鷄鬼）爲業的老太婆，要請她們來驅除，才會痊愈，但這種老太婆，却也不是眞正願意幹這種事情的，因爲鷄鬼）附在她們家裏，無可奈何，這種荒誕無稽的迷信，居然大家言之鑿鑿，聽者亦爲之深信不疑，這不能不說是怪事了，我們曾親耳聽得一位政治當局說，（鷄鬼症一實在不能以乏科學根據而否認他的存在，我當年幼時帶一男僕，途經龍州，這男僕就中過鷄鬼，他本是湖南人，不會粵語的，但得鷄鬼後忽操流利之龍州土語，且直奔（鷄鬼一之家中，其途徑彼固未嘗識者）又說，（當陸榮廷長桂時曾，把一個患鷄鬼的女人，灌以煤油，用火燒死，以爲鬼亦可隨之而死，但女人臨死時尙大呼：燒不死我，我卽死後還可傳之別人，結果女人固燒死，而鷄鬼仍存在）云云，我們到龍州後，就想把所謂（鷄鬼）倒底是怎麼一回事情打聽個明白，但結果甚爲失望，不但言人人殊，且多耳聞，並未目擊，而牽强附會，尤覺可笑</p>
<p>，如云中鷄鬼者可以縣政府之紅硃筆或縣印蓋之，卽可痊愈，更足證其無稽，不過，據我們向當地人多方探聽的結果，大概有一種龍州特殊的病症，患者兩眼發白，神經錯亂，作種種怪聲，喜吃香焦及鷄肉等物，至其他種種，多係好事者故神其說而巳，</p>
<p>在龍州住了三天，我們就回到南寗，關於牠的工商業狀况之詳細情形，此地不多贅了，廣西的經濟印象，如果我們把牠總括起來說，在對外貿易上，桂省恰好是中國的縮影，卽廣西各內地都市（除貴縣八步很少數的例外，幾無一不對梧州爲入超，而梧州又對香港廣州爲入超，換言之，就是各內地賣出的貨物少）而自梧州買入的貨物多，而梧州對香港廣州又是一樣的情形，這影響到金融方面，就形成各內地對梧州與梧州對香港滙價的高漲，與現銀的流出，這種危機，現在雖還不曾達到牠底頂點，而沒有達到不曾暴發的時期，但牠無疑地却是潛伏着的，</p>
<p>在商業與金融上，桂省除上述的一種危機外，還受一種不健全的影響，卽特貨行（烟土）的盛衰，能决定全省商業的繁榮與衰敗，金融的活潑與枯竭，例如南寗與梧州廣西省銀行的放欵，大部分以土行爲顧客，而梧州的二十四家銀號與南寗的十多家銀號的存放疑，也是以土行爲背景，再柳州·南寗，梧州······各地近年商業之破取，幾無一不受烟土通過桂省數量的多寡的影響，是其著者，若百色，長安，慶遠，等地的市塲，全賴特貨過境來維持，更是不用說的了，</p>
<p>在工業方面，廣西還完全停滯在手工工業的階段，機器工業是如風毛麟角，極不發達的，而所謂（手工工業）者，實際上也不過是小規模的手工藝，共生產口旣不足以供給全省之用，且帝國主義的商品早已奪取了他們固有的勢力範圍，所以在經濟上可說不占重要的地位，比較値得我們注意而在經濟生活上有關係的一種手工業，就是桂林與鬱林的織造土布，不過如我們上面所說明，其存在的方式也就非常可憐與殘酷，至於新式工業，則僅有梧州與柳州有幾個使用動力的工廠，但這種工廠在桂省經濟生活比重上亦占極不重要的地位，而且有的工業，（如土製煤油）時時受帝國主義傾銷的威脅，卽使有的時候偶而得些發展，亦不過僥天之倖，茍安朝夕而巳，</p>
<p>在土地關係上，廣西的土地問題亦巳日趨嚴重化，尤其是東南部受資本主義洗禮較早的領域，土地一天天集中在大地主手裏，中小地主沒落，自耕農淪落爲佃農的過程正在急速推移之中，反之，在西北部，自耕，農仍占農民中之多數，不過農村金融的枯竭，巳使他們日益趨于貧窮化與破產化了，</p>
<p>另一方面，無論在鄉村中或在城市，在農民或者小手工業者中，無不受高利貸資本與商人資本嚴酷的侵蝕與剝削，尤以商人資本之影響，較高利貨還要來得凶殘與發展，這是驅使小農破產一個極主要的內在因素高利貸，商人資本與商率地租組成之位一體把農民驅入破產沒落的苦海中去，如果廣西的農民不能擊破這三位一體的神聖同盟，則他們始終不能從貧窮中解放出來，廣西的經濟復興亦始終不能有效地實現，這是可以斷言的，</p>
<p>換一句話說，廣西是一個典型的半封建半殖民地的經濟組織，在生產方法上，牠是停滯在中古式的生產技術上，然而封建主義的自給自足却已被資本主義的商品所擊破，另一方面在商業上和消費品上，牠是資本主義化的，然而這種資本主義化却是被動的與半殖民地的，要是有人認爲這樣就是資本主義的生產方法已經占到優勢，　　無疑地會給他以無情的打擊的，這是我這次到廣西旅行後的總印象，（完）</p>

<h3>巿財政　力求開源節流　巿府秘書郭燊談話</h3>
<p>中央社云、此次在京召集之全國財政會議、對於地方財政、亦有詳實之討論、並有具體之决定、原有之烟酒牌照稅、現已决定劃歸地方稅、並責令各省巿組織捐稅監理委員會、中央社記者、特往巿府探詢關於此兩事、在本巿方面將如何進行、茲據巿府秘書郭燊談話如次、</p>
<h3>烟酒牌照稅歸地方</h3>
<p>本巿自一二八案發生後、對於收支方面殊覺難以平衡、蓋如復興事業及繁榮巿中心區等、尤須大宗欵項、而收入方面、旣未能增加人民負擔、故本巿財政當局、力求開源節流、現在中央以體察地方財政艱難、對於原由國家徵收之烟酒牌照稅、劃歸地方徵收、在本巿素爲工商業繁盛之區、將來該項稅收、亦可稍得挹注、惟現在巿府尙待中央正式公文到達時、再行籌備接收該項收入也、</p>
<h3>組織捐稅監理委會</h3>
<p>至於此次中央所擬責令之捐稅監理委員會之組織、乃以若干地方、往往巧立名目、徵收苛捐雜稅、此事實爲中央所久欲設法制裁者、現經全國財政會議通過後、責令各省巿組織該會、俾得監督有人、惟本巿方面、原有參議會之組織、對於各項財政問題、均送請該會審核、故將來是否應另組織、當再待巿政會議中詳加研究、</p>

<h3>减低房租運動　今日起總動員　全市房客一致向業主提出書面要求　呈請行政院市政府等從速明令减租</h3>
<p>本市减低房租運動、自各團體組織委員會主持辦理以後、各區聞風響應、紛紛組織分支會、迄今已不下五百餘處市、政府方面、亦以此事關係民生甚鉅、特提付市參議會討論、市參議會曾一度召集有關各團體徵詢意見、各方之重視、可見一斑、茲悉减租運動委員會、以此次問題遷延半載、尙未具體解决、業主與租戶間之糾紛、已日趨險惡、特於日前、開會議决、定於本月十七日（卽今日）起、舉行總動員一星期、巳規定各種辦法、分函各分支會一體辦理、並規定今日起、全市住戶一律張貼標語、以促業主覺悟、茲將各項消息彙誌於下、</p>
<h3>總動員宣言</h3>
<p>本市的减租運動、近來巳高唱入雲、照目前的趨勢、减租問題、已成爲社會一最嚴重的問題了、因爲上海的市面、自一二八給日本帝國主義者破壞後、內受農村崩潰生產低落的影響、外受世界經濟恐慌及帝國主義者不斷的侵略、工商各業、均已衰落不堪、住在上海的一般市民除少數地產階級和資本家外、無一不在含辛茹苦中求生存、而平均日常生活費用、房租一項往往占百分之三十或五十一勞苦羣衆、終日胼手胝足、旣不足供一家溫飽、而對於負担最重之高貴房租、尤覺不堪勝任、因爲衣食日用所需、尙可力行儉約、獨房租一項、不能絲毫拖欠、否則卽要受業主壓迫、訴追欠租、勒令遷讓、交相凌逼、因此商店拖累倒閉者固然很多、而住戶之被扣押者亦日有所聞、這是很顯明的事實了、現在上海市面、因商業凋敝、金融枯竭、市塲百物低落、惟有房租、却仍在繼長增高、地主們祇顧壟斷地產營業、大做投機、房東們亦罔顧房客生計、祇知層層剝削、於是一般市民和商店、都不能繼續担負此過高之房租、便發生了减低房租的要求、而减租運動會、便日益擴大起來了、現在减租問題、已成爲社會一最嚴重的問題了、不但各界人士、對於我們表同情、卽各國僑民、參加减租運動的、亦有十餘國的團體了、可見减租運動、在今日形勢之下、若不謀具體解决辦法、减輕負担、則破產失業等現象、必將更加普遍、社會前途的隠憂、也就不堪設想了、現在我們爲促進减租運動早日實現起見、已定於十七日起、爲全市總動員的時期了、我們動員的目的、在聯合大多數的市民、整齊步伐、用合理方法、請求行政當局予以救濟、早日頒佈减低房租標凖辦法、一方面積極擴大運動、集中全市市民力量、促進地產階級之業主覺悟、自動減低房租、而達到繁榮市面、解决人生四大需要之住的問題、才算完成了我們的使命、不過茲事體大、希望要有更大的努力來、共同實現這個目的</p>
<h3>呈市政府文</h3>
<p>呈爲請求明令减租、以蘇民困事、竊我國經濟衰落、至今日已達極點、農村經濟、旣陷於破產、都市商業、亦日形沒落、卽以上海一隅而論、營業衰敗、逈非昔比、加以一二八之役、元氣大傷、表面繁榮、實際空虛、丁在時亂年荒之際朝野上下、均力謀復興、以期蘇息、乃在物價指數逐項降低之時、惟房租一項、仍繼漲增高、寗非畸形發展之怪現象、推厥原因、實由於上海之所謂房產業完全係投機營業性質、以三四成之墊本、欲謀什百倍之利益（參照上海房產公會上市參議會說帖）輾轉販賣、累進增息、以原屬穏固之房產、作投機倖取之營業祇圖個人之利益、罔顧公共之福利、甚至市房一幢有月租千兩之高貴價格、故昔日所謂繁盛之區、覓一椽而不易、在今則空屋櫛比、問津無人、至若新建住宅、略加應有之衛生設備、而亦奇貨可居、高抬租額、不知謀整個市面之繁榮、而僅知謀房產一業之畸形發展、寗非怪事、且市面不振、商業衰落、因不勝負担房租、而被逼停業者、亦不乏人、而多一停業之商號、卽多一批失業之羣衆、甚至謀生乏術、挺而走險、是具影響社會之安寗、實非淺鮮、此房租昂貴、與社會關係之鉅、可以想見、且就一般經濟狀况而言因市面不振、收入减少、幸物價指數降低、生活尙可敷衍、譬如昔日購米一石之代價、今可購米二石有餘、但房租旣不隨之</p>
<p>减低、則一屋之代價、往往佔去一家之生活費用、是以二年以來、租房糾紛、乃日見增多、因欠租而涉訟、因涉訟而破家者、比比皆是、若不急謀救濟、前途不堪設想、故爲今之計、一面應評估租價、不准任意抬高、一面應将原有之高貴房租、加以酌减、庶可减少住户負担、俾不致多生枝節、是以减租運動之發生、純爲一安社會救濟民生之問題、自發起迄今、巳歷五月、全市居民、莫不翹首、望其實現、無非欲得一合理公平之解决而巳、惟是事關全局、影響甚鉅、鈞府爲全市行政之樞紐、對茲關係整個社會民生問題、當不忍加以漠視、而况首都减租问題、已由中政會决議施行、安慶市七折付租辦法、亦由省府議决公布、上海一市、爲全國商業之中心、尤當力謀其繁榮與復興、爲此縷述下情、凟請鈞長·垂念滬市商業之衰落·社會經濟之危機、迅予乾綱獨斷、明令减租、以蘇民困、曷勝公感、謹呈上海市市長吳、（呈行政院文略同從略）</p>

<h3>呈三法院文</h3>

<p>求、惟推行以來、已逾半年、深明大義之房主、自動减租者、固屬有人、然大部份之業主、則不顧經濟民生、藉法律爲護符、狡黠者且藉假扣押假執行以爲壓迫减租之利器、查租賃物爲不動產者、因其價値之昇降、當事人得聲請法院、增减其租金、爲民法第四四二條所規定、計算房價、雖無一定方法、然現下市面蕭條、鬧市空屋、無人過問、已成不可諱言之事實、報紙上每日减價召租之廣告、房地產押欵爲銀錢業削减至七八折不等、均爲其價値低落之明證、是目下减租要求、本屬根據事實、合於法理、又民事訴訟、請假扣押假執行之宣示、亦有非有日後難於執行之虞者、不得爲之要件、房東因房客求减租、揑詞控訴、本在意中、但法院受其朦蔽、迭有派員查封押遷之事發生、致市民擬法律爲房東而設、迨提供現金、回復啓封、已受莫大之損失、卽如虹口聯成坊六十三家房客、事前均妥覓保證、事後復存儲現金於銀行、其爲缺乏難於執行之虞者、顯而易見、而竟一齊被封、卽其一例、敝會等爲圖謀市面之發展、解除民衆之痛苦、對於法院、本不敢有逾分之期求、使偏袒一方、且明知减低房租、未見明令、判决案件、不無缺乏依據、而調查佐證、又嫌手續麻煩、現幸市府已函參議會召集雙方、亟謀解决在案、在此糾紛未有解决前、關於减租糾紛、尙然根據現實、平情酌理、顧及法律保護房客利益之條、而爲適當平允之拖、如房客能提銀行存租之證據者、卽屬要求减租、而非有意欠租、卽祈摒絕房東之要求、對於假扣押假執行之宣示、暫行停止、使房東去其朦蔽壓迫之機、而房客得更慶再甦之望、則感恩戴仁豈特敝會已哉、爲特具呈、伏乞鈞院察核施行、無任迫切待命之至、謹呈上海第一特區地方法院院長·上海地方法院·上海第二特區地方法院、</p>
<h3>舉行大請願</h3>

<h3>中國旅行社經理　陳湘濤赴京接洽通車</h3>
<p>華東社云、平藩通車、中日雙方對於一切辦法、均已商討、惟我方因承辦問題、尙未解决、故何日實現、尙難决定、政府當</p>
<p>局現對此事、正繼續向中國旅行社接洽中、該社經理陳湘濤、已於昨晨八時、搭京滬路特別快車晋京、向鐵部當局商洽一切、華東社記者曾向該社訪問、該社承認陳君業已赴京、但是否接洽通車、謂爲不知、對於政府當局擬以該社主持通車後之營業手續、亦謂係屬事實、一方鑒於茍由外人辦理、利權未免外溢、故勉爲其難、至其內容、則尙未至公布之期也、</p>

<p>中國航空恊會召開全國航空救國大會、經草定會議規程等、呈送行政院核議後、業已多日、未奉復令遵照、故該會秘書長林我將、又於十五日夜入京、向政府請示、一俟院令頒下、卽進行籌備、並分函</p>
<p>各省市派代表出席、大約兩週後卽可開幕、又聞該會將召開之飛行社發起人會議、因有一部份未將提案寄來、故會期約在本月底或下月初云、</p>

<h3>財部負責人談印花並不劃爲地方稅　提成抵補地方稅不足　仍由財政部統收分撥　省局改組說完全不確</h3>
<p>近日印花稅劃歸地方辦理之說、所傳不一、外間難明眞相、昨據財部負責人云、此次財政會議議决、减輕田賦附加、廢除苛捐雜稅、不惜犧牲、以中央之印花稅、作爲各地方抵補之用、原爲督促實行起見、惟印花稅原係國稅之一、仍由財部統收分撥、並非劃爲地方稅、改歸地方辦理、不過爲整頓稅務增加收入計、此後將責成地方政府、恊助中央稅務機關、切實辦理、一切辦法、正在主管署司詳細研究之中、尙未呈經部長核定公布、外間所傳改歸地方如何辦理、省局如何改組、種種揣測之詞、不無誤會云、</p>

<p>負責、與錢江義渡辦事處商洽辦理、（三）浙贛路三次客車與京滬滬杭甬一次京閘通車𠼫接案、討�</p>
<p>論結果、因浙贛路三次客車、必須於十八點左右開行、而京閘一次、則須於十九點四十七分到達南星橋站、且杭市公共汽車午後六時、卽行停駛、天黑渡江、亦至危險、而如浙贛三次車遲開、則至閘邊及贛邊之旅客、當日不獲到達、故當經决議保留、（四）浙贛路增開列車案、决議、俟浙贛路添購機車後、設法增開、（五）浙贛二次車與滬杭甬三十二次車𠼫接案、决議、浙贛路二次車、原擬改至玉山開行嗣因到達江邊站時間太遲、不獲與滬杭甬路三十二次車𠼫接、故仍由衢縣開�</p>

<p>[L讀書問答&gt;</p>
<h3>讀文學書的興趣（續）</h3>
<p>|答顧念椿李行魚二君　　在總原則下，我們以爲顧李二君首先應該理解文學是什麼，因而抱定一個正確的目的來研究文學。爲了吃飯的問題，我們所以要去做工，要去種田，卽使明知這是苦事，然而也能勉强相安下去，除非到了無法生活的時候。無論對於做什麼事，開始是常常感不到興趣的，假如你沒有固定的目標，沒有堅强的意志，你便要因爲一時的不高興，而發生厭惡，終而至於消沉。我們看，世上有不少，心猿意馬，不少「有始無終」的人，他們就是因爲沒有絲毫忍耐心，以致永遠引不起眞實的興趣，才陷入了失敗的泥坑。如顧君剛開始讀文學書籍，其不能發生興趣，乃如一個小孩，賴學一樣平常，但顧君却决不要如小孩一样盲目，對於文學，應該有百折不回的抱負，應該認定文學是我們終生事業，是與我們生活及所與社會最有關聯的學問，而且要深信文學是有興趣的，研究愈深入，則興趣愈濃，勉强的讀，注入的讀，這是我們提供顧李二君的讀文學書第一步辦法。　　如前面所述及，我們的生活，爲我們研究文學的决定點。那末，我們要提高讀文學書的興趣，自非使生活更接近於文學生活不可。文學生活是什麼呢？以前的學者們，把文學當成個人娛樂，當成書生自已書箱內的學問，所以「閉戶潛修」，「兩耳不聞窗外事，」以至「優游林下，」便是他們最適當的文學生活，但現在，我們對於文學的認識，顯然不同了。我們的文學生活，自然也不是什麼「閉戶潛修」了，我們的文學，不是書本上的知識，乃是廣泛的社會生活的縮影。社會生活有變動，文學的主潮也有變動，於是，我們的所謂文學生活也就有變動。如李君喜歡讀予且等的小說，而不愛讀魯迅等的小說，便是因爲李君的生活更接近於予且等所描寫的社會現象，而不接近魯迅等所描寫的社會現象。現在的文學，是服務大衆的，文學上所描寫的，是大衆的艱苦的生活，這樣，我們要研究文學，我們便必須使自已的生活與大衆的生活接近，甚至打成一片。我們要從「書齋」跑進大衆的隊伍裏面去，我們要把視綫從「案頭」移入社會的底層。我們要從生活的體騐中，養成自已的豐富的大衆情緒，最少我們對於大衆要理解，要同情。那種情緒，才是文學的要素。我們具有了這素養，必然地，對於文學，我們便有進一步的認識；所能引起我們的興趣的，决不致是戀愛，武俠的無聊作品，而只有描寫大衆生活的文學作品。接近大衆生活，是我們提供顧李二君讀文學書的第二步辦法。</p>
<p>對於研究文學旣有堅固正確的目標，我們的生活，又能與我們所需要的文學生活相接近，於是餘下的，便只有怎樣使我們的興趣慢慢提高，就是怎樣從我們自已的感受力來决定我们的讀物的問題了。這可以分兩方面來說，一是「漸進」的，一是「突進」的。在我們讀書的過程上。我們固不能忽視「漸進」的原則，但尤不要忘記有使自已的興趣「突進」的可能。不注意突進，是最容易陷入一安分守已一，「聽其自然」的錯誤的。</p>
<p>所謂「漸進」，便是不要想「一步登天」），而要「由淺入深」的方法。私塾小孩的「賴學」，主要的便是先生的敎授方法不良，一方面，把一個活潑的孩子，猝然禁錮起來，一方面又授與完全不是小孩所能消化的食料|四書五經，這怎能不使小孩視「進學如上殺塲」呢？試看，現在的小學敎育，便不致發生這樣的現象。舉例來說，顧李　君，如果平常只讀過戀愛俠義小說，那末，現在自然只好讀鬼公予且等的小說，再進方可讀魯迅茅盾的小說，再進再可以讀世界名著。在形式方面，也應該由小品，而短篇，而長篇，而名譯，讀時，除文字的瞭解外，特別應該注意作品的中心描寫是什麼，題材所關聯的社會現象的分解，因爲不這樣，有時由於自已的易懂，便要不求甚解）地减少對該作品的興趣。有許多國文敎員，往往敎新文藝要失敗，便是忽略這一點，以致使學生發生白話文易懂的錯覺。</p>

<h3>家庭敎育</h3>
<p>潘公展講家庭敎育之重要、略謂敎育包含敎與敎育兩種意義、依我們人生來講應先育而後敎、欲使一小國民長大成健全的國民、育與敎不能迵慶古越王句踐、受吳壓迫、十年生聚、十年敎訓、卒能滅吳、所謂生聚卽「育」、敎訓卽、「敎」故敎育實包括兩方面意義、現在學校敎育、普通學校以往都遍於敎而忽於育、最近以來學校中除敎智識以外、尙注意其運動衛生等項此種遍廢現象日漸改正至社會敎育中國尙在萌芽時代、較學校敎育尤爲幼稚、依現在狀况而說亦犯了以往學校敎育之錯誤、重敎而忽育、這都不是眞正敎育的宗旨、眞正敎育的宗旨、一定要從育做起、再做到敎、而家庭敎育實爲敎育的基礎、以往家庭祇注意於育、而把敎認爲置入學以後的事、讓學校去做、卽對於育、大多數家庭尙用着舊方法去撫養、頗多不合時代、因此許多小孩、看到有病、與國家民族前途頗爲危險、我人要復興民族、一定要注意敎育、而家庭敎育是重要之事、不特小孩在入學前益重要、卽入學後家長仍應繼續擔負此責任、普通一般人把家庭敎育、學校敎育、社會敎育分成三個時期、以爲兒童在入學以前爲受家庭敎育時期、入學以後爲受學校敎育時期、畢業以後在社會服務爲受社會敎育時期、把整個人生的敎育、劃分三代、這是很大的錯誤、須知學校敎育是有固定的時間的、而家庭敎育與社會敎育則不受時間限制的、一個人有家庭之存在、卽無日不在受家庭敎育、一個人在社會間生存、卽無日不在受社會敎育、故家庭敎育與社會敎育、無時間限制無階段劃分、時刻在發生作用、我們要打敎育基礎當以家庭敎育入手、欲擴大敎育效力卽不能忘了社會敎育、家庭敎育之重要旣如是、我人實不可忽略、且上海社會環境惡劣、我們要使小孩子不受惡劣社會之影響、則家庭敎育更有重視之必要、最近敎局曾在兩個小學中檢騐學生之結果、統計有百分之六十、以上足有患肺結核者、我們要使小孩不有肺病、</p>
<p>祇靠學校當局、敎育局及衛生局是不够的、必須家庭合作、才能做此健康工作、蔣委員長倡導之新生活運動、以家庭中能使子女實行、則家庭敎育之目的卽達到　蓋新生活運動在學校卽成學校敎育、在家庭卽成家庭敎育也、並希望家庭敎育講座將來用播音方法、則收效更可普遍云、</p>
<h3>兒童健康</h3>
<p>李廷安講兒童健康、略謂、健康爲一切事業之基礎、而兒童健康尤爲重要、中國現在兒童生病者較外國兒童多二三倍、民衆健康破產、當此國難時期、須有健康的民衆、才能抵抗一切困難、要民衆健康一定要兒童健康、而要兒童健康一定要家庭敎育、研究兒童之營養、兒童之運動、兒童之衛生及心理健康等等云、</p>
<h3>母愛問題</h3>
<p>劉王立明講（母愛）略謂、第一要認我母愛之重要、母愛凡高等動物都有、是天賦的、（二）母愛是宇宙間最偉大的愛（三）母愛是社會博愛的中心、第二母親要理性化、現在有錢的家庭母親、有的溺愛、有的不負責任、無錢的母親則無法敎養、故我們須使母親敎養子女要理性化第三擴大母愛、以自已的小孩貢獻社會、以社會上之苦孩子當作自已孩子云、</p>

<h3>中小學文言運動（一）</h3>
<p>— 汪懋祖</p>
<p>近讀吳研因先生駁拙著（禁習文言與强令讀經）</p>
<p>一文、多似是而非之談、並抰部令以自固、竊恐眞理不彰、不得不更嚴辭闢之、</p>
<p>（一）吳先生以文言白話之爭、至今尙未結束、嘆爲敎育界之不幸、不得不深惜吳先生之少見多怪、吾以爲文言文一日不絕響、則此項問題便自一日存在、舉例證之、</p>
<p>一·歐洲自宗敎革命、倡行白話文、至今四百餘年、而古典文仍爲中學課程之要素、或分組修習、或列作選科、而中學初級、卽注重語文訓練、二·歐戰後、各國敎育類多革新、一九二二年六月、法國敎育總長MleonBerard提出學課程改造計劃以拉丁文及希臘文改爲通習科目、（法國中學共七年前期四年、向分古文今文兩組）自第一年級起、敎授拉丁文、第三年級起、敎授希臘文、非拉丁希臘文及法語及格、不得應學位考試、（法國Baccalsureat爲中學畢業學位）三·英國自工黨執政、新制中學頗稱發達、不習古文、學者恒盧古典失墜、特組織學會、提倡古典的修養、</p>
<p>四·美國敎育上之研究及創造、自多新異、而反對之聲浪、所在多有、茲在留學筆記中擇摘二節如下、</p>
<p>（一）一九一九年九月余轉學哈佛大學、旁聽文學敎授Babbitl先生課、離哈佛時至其家請益、先生爲余講人文主義之重要、及握手告別、先生丁寗相囑、宜多信孔子勿信杜威、</p>
<p>（二）一九二O年三月、隨袁觀瀾先生赴紐約省城、參觀省敎育局及省立圖書館、晤館長Winmer談敎育、據氏之意見、現在美國敎育已失敎育之眞義、若敎育之眞義、必於古典中求之、蓋氏亦人文主義之信徒、意見不免稍偏也、</p>
<p>抑有進者、吾國文言與白話相差之程度、决不如西洋古文與近代語相距之遠、尙未可相提並論、</p>
<p>而各國學者孜孜焉惟古典之失墜是憂、吾國敎育家乃希望文言之典籍、如（無邊落木蕭蕭下）異矣、</p>
<p>（二）十餘年前所謂新文化運動、課其成績、不過語體文在學校課程上占有地位、他無有也、而當年一般主張由話者、所以箝制對方之口實、殆不外二式、一則尋章摘句、吹毛求疵、或爲無理的謾駡、或以尖刻之筆鋒、極譏笑之能事、一則不辨是非、任舉一二惡例、以相壓制、使人不屑與辯、詡詡然自以爲成功矣、鄙文拙劣、謬承推重、非所敢當、獨惜吳先生於鄙文似猶未能了澈、故斷章取義、改竄字句、枝枝節節而曲解之、則所以養成靑年谿刻尖巧之惡習者、吳先生當能覺悟、不然、吳先生爲衛（白話之道）不惜抹殺一切事實、似亦背敎育之意義、</p>
<p>吳先生引用袁世凱做皇帝、主張尊孔讀經、張勳張宗昌之徒、亦主張尊孔讀經務使做皇帝復辟與尊孔讀經、聯爲一體、造成極可怕之聯想、以吳氏之邏輯推之、則凡今日主張尊孔讀經者、皆袁世凱張勳之流、故急急否認陳濟棠何鍵等之主張讀經、以免引起反響、而歸其過於學校當角其用心可謂巧而苦矣、殊不知天下良法美制、爲惡人假借、或良法美制之下、偶生惡果、其例不少概見、必謂此法此制、當予剷除、充斯義也以往、則李自成亦曾舉行考試、而考試制度卽不能復用、民國四年一月大總統令有云、</p>

<h3>恥和耻</h3>
<p>— 吕玄</p>
<p>小朋友們！你們在讀書的時候，常常可以看見「恥」字的兩個寫法嗎？一個是從「心」的，還有一個却從「止」的。但是其中却寓着二種不同的意思！「恥」字就是一件恥辱的事，從耳朶聽進去，立時放到心裏去了。這種人是會洗雪他的恥辱的，他是有志氣的人。「耻」字就是把一件恥辱的事從耳朶聽進去，就止住了。他從來不曾把恥辱放在心上的。</p>
<p>我們中國受了無數的國恥，却從來不想去洗雪，大概就是因爲把「恥」字寫錯，寫了「耻」字了。小朋友！你們以後就該記牢，　不要再把「恥」字寫做「耻」字呀！而同時，我誠懇的希望你們：不要把恥辱只記在耳朶邊，而快快的要記在心裏啊！</p>
<h3>實行新生活</h3>
<p>— 汪瘦秋</p>
<p>|次應注意淸潔整齊|</p>
<p>實行新生活，首應注重禮貌，小朋友們是已經知道了。現在再說其次吧：我以爲新生活中最要緊的，就是淸潔；整齊；淸潔就是乾凈，無論身上穿的；肚裏吃的；總要注意淸潔兩個字。因爲穿的乾凈，纔不致被人厭惡：吃的乾凈，纔不致傳染時疫；尤其是現在這種天氣，是更應該特別注意的。致於整齊，和淸潔是有連帶的關係的，如果不整齊，就根本談不上淸潔兩個字了。不過整齊並不是單指身上，身上穿得固然要整齊，就是床上，桌上，也應該佈置得齊齊整整，使人見到可以發生美感，千萬不可雜亂無章，使人見而生厭啊！</p>
<p>小朋友們！淸潔整齊，是新生活中的重要條件，大家來注意實行吧！</p>
<h3>望遠鏡是誰發明的？</h3>
<p>— 世聰</p>
<p>望遠鏡是誰發明的？我想諸位小朋友立時很難回答的吧？我來告訴你們罷！是一位荷蘭小朋友發明的。我想諸位一定很驚奇（？）你們別奇怪，且聽我慢慢道來。</p>
<p>在十七世紀的初葉，荷蘭有一個眼鏡商人，名呌琴生的，有一天，他的兒子拿了鑲眼鏡的凸鏡片玩耍，一前一後照着遠近的東西，忽然狂呼起來，說他看那敎堂頂上的風向儀，是在他的眼前了。</p>
<p>他的父親聽見，奔出店來，接過鏡片照樣試看，果然比平常不用鏡片近得多了，後將他把鏡片鑲在板上，不使它動，這樣就成了世界上第一具的望遠鏡了。</p>
<p>後來漸漸改良，就成了天文學上一件必不可少的東西了。</p>
<h3>房屋的基礎</h3>
<p>— 人偉</p>
<p>麟兒是剛從鄕下出來的孩子，這都巿的一切，似乎都使他覺着異樣和新奇；特別是那外灘一帶高聳雲霄的瀰天大厦,這樣地高而又大的房屋，在鄕村裏是從未看見過的；同時有一種好奇的感覺，襲進他那小小的心田，他想：「鄕下的許多茅舍小屋，尙經不起風吹雨打，坍的坍，倒的倒，何况這樣高大的房屋，爲什麼不會坍下來呢」？這時，麟兒的父親在旁，看見他對着這偉大的建築物目不轉睛地兀自發呆，不覺問道：「麟兒，你有什麼疑問麼，爲什麼呆呆地站着呀」？於是麟兒便把心中的疑團，很詳細地告訴父親。父親說：「這是房屋的基礎關係，鄕下的農民因爲貧乏的緣故，沒有充分的力量把房屋的基礎奠得堅固，以致不久便坍塌了；上海是全國金融的樞紐，企業家的資本雄厚，他們的建築物不怕沒有充分的力量和時間，使它的基礎打得異常穏固，雖歷數百年也是鞏固如初，不會動搖的呀」</p>
<p>小朋友！你們在學校中讀書，和房屋的奠基，是完全沒有什麼差異的：一個人不能不讀書，譬如一座房屋不能不奠基；讀書而不努力，不用功，譬如房屋的基礎，打得不穏固，將來在社會上也是不能長久立足的！</p>

<p>小朋友！您們在空閒的時候，不是喜歡「搶三十」嗎？搶着多呢？還是被別人搶去多呢？您們在「春秋兒童周刋」裏，讀過了兩位朋友「搶三十的」方法，有否試騐過？有否研究過？大凡甚麼一件事情，要成功，不要失敗，總須細心想想纔是！|自有一個道理想出來的。</p>
<p>據咱研究所得，倒想出一個最簡便的秘訣來了。</p>
<p>保險搶得着二十，一些兒不致於失敗。方法十分簡便，似夫比前天兩位朋友說的好：所以不得不報告於諸位小朋友　秘訣只有八個字，便是：「人單我雙，人雙我單。」人家說了一天，我便設了兩天：人家說了兩天，我便說了一天：只須人家先說，|倘對方不知道這個秘訣，您先說也不妨。|結果，保您搶着三十。</p>
<p>這些小訣竅，是從算學上悟出來的，不是比別的法兒簡便嗎？算學裏有許多奇妙的法兒，小朋友·您們不妨請您們的敎師玩些「數學游戲，」啓發您們的智慧吧！</p>
<p>末了，咱要勸小朋友把小小的拳，常常來豁，|便是酒席上的「豁拳，」這是比搶三十更有趣。可以（啓發心靈）（敏捷眼光，）非常有益的。但，千萬不可賭錢賭酒嶯！</p>
<h3>郊野宿縣縣立十四小學</h3>
<p>— 常少英</p>
<p>暮春飄去，初夏飛來；在這當兒，細雨濛濛，微風習習，我獨自站在繪河北岸的小閣上，放眼望那潤濕的郊野，碧綠的草原，雪白的菜花，以及那舞女似的細柳：比較雨前，格外淸新　　格外鮮艷！着實令人可愛呀？！</p>
<p>生滿雜草的田徑，來往的農夫，都穿着輕柔的草履，披着鬆軟的蓑衣：小魚似的陣陣都向田裏去。遠看蒼蒼的原野近聽淙淙的流水！好像那造物的天使，開放着門扉：自然的女神低吟着歌曲沉默的鐘聲，自遠處悠悠的傳來，暗帶着悲壯激烈的情緒：刺入了我的心窩！不由使我悲感交集！無心再看郊景！就很失意地回校來了。</p>
<h3>簡單晴雨測驗器</h3>
<p>— 史濟宏</p>
<p>早上還是好好出着旺太陽，下半天却突然地下起大雨來：小朋友們，你可能預先知道嗎？這裏我敎你做幾樣很簡單的晴雨測騐器，它會告訴你天的晴雨，在上校去之前看一看，便知道你該不該帶着雨具了。</p>
<p>在一小杯熱水中溶解了四五匙的食鹽，使成一杯極濃的濃鹽湯，把一張很軟的淡紅吸墨水紙浸去，待乾後再浸一次，使這一張吸水紙上黏住了不少很細小的鹽粒結晶體，然後把它掛在房內，當這幾天天氣很好，空氣中乾燥，望去這吠水紙似白的一般；如果它忽然變做紅色，便可以知道空氣中含有很多水份，天將下雨了。</p>
<p>有時候吃到一種很硬的餅乾，含些薑味，這便呌做薑汁餅乾，薑汁餅乾也可以做一個晴雨測騐器，祇消在那一片餅乾上面鑽一個小洞，用一根細綫繫住；如天不行，那餅乾便變得很酥：反之，天很乾燥，那餅乾仍舊是硬硬的。</p>
<p>把六七朶新開的蒲公英，（在草地上有像菊花般的小黃花便是）揷在一塊海綿中，蒲公英的梗紋需半英寸長，倘天晴，花便開着·天要下雨，蒲公英統統謝了，下一次仍舊再要使你去找它們做你的簡單晴雨測騐器了。</p>
<h3>蓮塘</h3>
<p>— 水鍔</p>
<p>荷葉綠，</p>
<p>荷花開；</p>
<p>一對蜻蜓風吹來。</p>
<p>吹進蓮塘裏，</p>
<p>做些好游戲，</p>
<p>有時同跳舞，</p>
<p>有時排演結婚禮。</p>
<p>他們吃飯了；</p>
<p>一片荷花當做碗；</p>
<p>他們睡覺了，</p>
<p>一張荷葉當做牀；</p>
<p>碗裏||香香香！</p>
<p>牀上||凉凉凉！</p>

<h3>氣的變化</h3>
<p>— 林蔭</p>
<p>小朋友，我們前次不是講過風是空氣震盪而成的嗎？有人這樣問我：郝麼「空氣是什麼）</p>
<p>呢？」	我可以簡單回答一句：一空氣是一種氣體，無色無臭，雖然我們不能看見它的形體，但是它也和其他的物體一樣，佔有着空間的地位。你不信吧？你拿一隻空的杯子，平覆到水裏，水就不能鑽到裏面去。因爲杯子裏面有着空氣，不　水進去。要是杯口稍微傾側，水面立刻起了泡沫，杯子裏面也有着水了。「圖一」這泡沫就是因爲空氣從裏面出來而起的。空氣是維持一切動物的生命，如果離開了空氣，人就不能生活。你若悶住了口鼻，。三五分鐘以後，立刻就會死的。「圖二」空氣是四分炭氣，一分養氣的化合氣體。我們所需要的是養氣，呼出來的便是炭氣。所以空氣中也有炭氣水蒸氣混合着。</p>
<p>水蒸氣，是水受了熱度蒸發上升而成的，海水河水被太陽曬着，一部分便變民氣體上升。像一件濕的衣服，用火烘着的時候，看見一股股的熱氣騰出來一是樣的道理。（圖三）水蒸氣上升到空中，遇着冷空氣凝成雲。如果遇着較冷的空氣，就成了水滴下降，呌做雨。（圖四）水蒸氣蒸發的時候，沒有上升到天空，在地面上就遇着冷氣而凝結了呌做霧露。（圖五）</p>
<p>夏天氣候較熱，水蒸氣蒸發上升較多，所以夏季的雨量也較多。從前一般人以爲雨是有神管理着的話，我們看了上面的解釋，可以知道這是氣體的變化呀！</p>

<h3>看書</h3>
<p>— 劍芬</p>
<p>小朋友：在光綫不明亮的地方看書，和眼睛靠近書本上看書，眼睛是很容易受傷；久而久之，就要變成近視眼的。我們要保護眼睛，不使眼睛變成近視眼：第一我們以後要：不在光綫不明亮的地方看書；尤其是在日落以後，沒有上燈以前的當兒，光綫很是糊塗，那時候最好不要看書：如果要看書的話，就要先把燈開着，使光綫明亮後再看。第二不要把書本靠近眼睛；最好把書本放在離開眼睛一尺左右的地方。小朋友：當你看書的時候，你記着這兩個條件，照樣的做去，包你的眼睛是不會變成近視眼的了。</p>
<h3>寫字</h3>
<p>小朋友：我們寫字的時候，兩臂要平，背脊要直，頭不傾向，坐不偏斜，那沒寫起字來，不但方正，</p>
<p>而且對身體，也是有益而無害。不然，駝着背，低着頭，不坐正，手不擺平，就在那裏寫字，一次二次···的下去，由習慣而成個性；字非但不能寫好，並且背脊要慢慢的變成駝背了。小朋友：你要你的字寫得好嗎？背脊不要變駝嗎？你得在寫字的時候，養成良好的習慣。</p>
<h3>怎樣避電擊</h3>
<p>— 希實</p>
<p>春天一去，夏天就來？在夏天落大雷雨是很平常的事，而一般人對於大電雨也是最驚懼的事，尤其是我們小孩，看見鑠亮的電光，隆隆的電聲，時時刻刻都會想到有生命之危，現在就讓我來談談避電撃的方法吧！</p>
<p>烏雲陣陣，大雨如注，雷電交作的時候，我們不必恐慌，要緊的是想法子遠避易於電擊的地方，如欄子，鍋子。及自來水龍頭等，只要是金屬爲質的，須留心遠避，在戶外時，切忌站在樹底下或圍墻的導水管旁躱避，更不可在荒蕪的野地曠場上奔跑，尤其是不要站在土丘或山嶺的巓上，因爲在這些地方，我們立的位置較高，易作電殛的標的物，而遭不測，在火車里，須遠離車箱的邊緣。家居時，宜遠門窗而立在一室的中央，那麼，電雖厲害，對於我們，也就無可奈何了。</p>
<h3>農村小友的通問</h3>
<p>— 子明</p>
<p>放牛</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友！鄕間農友們都很忙了。我們這班小友，也要相幫爸爸媽媽做些輕微事體。學校裏不能去了：好得放了忙假，不致缺課。</p>
<p>剛剛孵出的小鷄，不但要喂它，還要看守好：老鴉，鷹和野貓，時常能攫奪去吃。雖然，老鷄維護着，究竟實力有限；所以，這責任爹媽交給我了。</p>
<p>大人們，都忙着收穫耕種；但，老黃牛是不能忍着肚皮的，每天淸早星落之際，日下西山之會，小友們各牽着自已的牛，在河岸邊，墳塲上，放草了。小朋友聚在一塊兒，猜猜謎兒，講講故事，唱唱調兒，哼哼山歌，倒很快樂。不過，有時，牛互相角鬥，那就難爲我們小主人了，弄得呌哭連天。</p>
<p>牛打水，也要看好：我們坐在車輪上，看看小說，倒很舒暢。同時又得着爹媽的歡心。</p>

<h3>再論托兒所</h3>
<p>— 茲九</p>
<p>並答師石君　　六月二日，本報本埠增刋載師石君「再談托兒所與公育」一文。評筆者前文「關於托兒所與兒童公育」「見本刋第十五期」爲「偏於樂觀」，而又有此憂心忡忡之論。茲更與師石君析疑如右：</p>
<p>（一）師石君鄭重地聲明，他反對托兒所，是根據於中國現實社會的情况。但筆者正以爲現社會中之有職業婦女，已是事實，社會旣容許有職業婦女，爲職業婦女便利計，爲職業婦女的子女幸福計，當然應有設立代育機關的必要，目前上海公私團體的籌設「勞働托兒所」這證明在事實上托兒所已有設立之必要。且師石君本人也承認在這一「動機」上設立托兒所「正不必非議，也毋需非議」那末，爲何又來一個反對？所以師石君自已的言論，已陷於矛盾。</p>
<p>（二）師石君引了些大思想家，尤其婦運先進愛倫凱的言論，來反對托兒所，但事實勝於雄辯，反對者儘管反對，施行者依舊在施行，不必遠及歐美，更不必遙瞻蘇聯，僅觀隣邦之日本，大都巿托兒所的設立，已是有目共睹之事，卽農村僻壤，在農忙期間，亦有臨時托兒所的設立。所謂「贊同者不如反對者持論之鞏固有據」，於事實何補？師石君爲什麼又忘却了「現實」？</p>
<p>（三）高級動物之有「母性」是一自然現象，尤以人類爲最顯著。但不能說有「母性」卽會「敎育」彼猿猴之哺乳，母燕之領導飛翔，只是本能的所謂「母性」而巳，人類所需要的，當不止此。人類所需要的是敎育，良好的敎育。事實吿訴我們在婦女中，能夠懂得敎育子女的，百不一二，興其强不會敎育的來敎育未來的主人翁，不如托諸有專門知識而會敎養的保姆，來得安全而有希望。師石君謂「撫育兒女，一方在謀肉體上的發育，一方是使兒女臻於精神上的健全，這是狠對的；但，是否情性暴燥，目不識丁，或困於飢寒下的母親，所能勝任？若要使此等婦女，人人能理想地敎育子女，不如訓練少數會敎育的保姆來擔任，此較經濟而得益，且就「現實」而論，兒童在托兒所裏，在專家「保姆」指導與完善設備之下，一定比在家裏快活。否則我國敎育系統上的「幼稚園」應當取消，各地已成立者也都應該關閉了。（至師石君所引莫斯科公育嬰兒死亡率大，因未指出材料來源，筆者也一時無從找尋，故其可靠與否，尙待查考）</p>
<p>以上三點，並不是「理論」的空談，而都是鐵一般的事實，鐵一般的現實。</p>
<p>此外師石君似乎對托兒所本身，有許多誤解，對兒童公育誤作兒童國有之弊。按諸先進國家，並沒因托兒所之設立而破壞了家庭，卽社會主義下的蘇聯，托兒所已經那樣普遍，也沒有聽得取消了家庭的存在。現在中國的家庭制度，正待有托兒所，才能一部分改善。况且各國一般的托兒所，所收容的兒童，大祇均在兩三歲以上，早出晚歸，與學齡兒童上學無異。至若襁褓嬰兒母親仍得親自去哺乳，或預儲乳汁，|當然有特別保存法|托保姆喂給。不然，亦得給予與兒童體質相近的人乳與牛乳。師石君將托兒所，當作我國往昔的育嬰堂，未免錯誤。至於中國已有的，或未來的托兒所的成績如何，這是方法與管理問題，與原則無關，我們正應督促它漸臻於完美，漸至於普遍，不應因噎廢食地來反對。</p>
<h3>眞和僞</h3>
<p>— 碧遙</p>
<p>在從前，「母愛」是被認爲最神聖，最高貴；婦女在這上面，的確是拼了性命的表演。現今許多偉人。對閫外的國事，所謂「忍辱負重」，所謂「臥薪嘗胆」，所謂「大無畏完成」），種種偉大的，勞苦功高的愛國舉動，大約和她們的愛兒子相彷彿。</p>
<p>一件事情被認爲神聖，寶貴以後，自會有人來竸爭。家庭骨肉之愛，其間就有丈夫出來爭「父慈」，兒女出來爭「子孝」，兄弟出来爭「友愛」等等；正如現在的愛國救國一樣，也有所謂「歌舞救國」，「拜佛救國」，「買彩票救國」，之類。然而說起來自是母親的愛兒子，和偉人的長期抵抗的愛國家，是許多竸爭者中的最能得人的信用。</p>
<p>但這「愛」是要抓住實物來表現：漂流的猶太人，何從來愛他的國家？沒有孩子的女人，也不能完成她的「母愛」。於是爲完成他的「至愛」，單看女性之中，爭奪實物的事也就不爲少。而至「眞母」和「僞母」的爭辯，常爲難以解决的糾葛。</p>
<p>「從前日本江戶地方，有一個寡婦，把嬰兒託給人家，自已到外面帮工。幾年之後，她想把孩子領回，可是那養母不承認有這回事。兩下爭持，到了太守那兒打官司。太守細細地想了一番，呌拿孩子放在兩女人的中間，她們倆各拉了孩子的一隻手，誰拉勝了官司就算誰贏。兩方用力地拉，孩子負痛哭起來了，一個女人便放了手。於是太守判道：『孩子哭了也不管，定是不通人情的狡猾東西，放下手的才是孩子的眞母。』」　　這故事中對於賢明的太守的判辭，無論那位通人情的讀者，想來都要稱快。假如只顧自已勝利，不顧小孩的苦痛，小手兒給拉斷了，小生命拉完了，這當然不是眞母忍心做得出的事；卽使她做得出，那她又與僞母何異？眞母與僞母之間，沒有其他天然的標識，但看她是不是忍心殘害而已。</p>
<p>不但母愛，一切的愛都不能包含有忍心殘害。人類大抵可分爲絕對的兩類：一類是完全犧牲自已，以愛廣大的社會人羣：一類是完全戕賊他人，以利自已的一身。兩者的不同，有如白盡與黑夜的分明。不過其間容許有灰色的破曉和黃昏，儘　殻那些中庸的人材，在這境界上疑懼委縮，糊塗徘徊。</p>
<p>眞純的母愛，她只盼望兒子健全長大，必不枉曲兒子肖她，孝她，或屬於她，像那搶奪人子以爲已子的僞母，雖也經之營之，似乎盡了母親養育的職務；然而一旦因不能達到「屬於她」的所有慾時，小生命可以在她手裏立刻送斷。她畢竟只有「僞愛」。幸而她無力蒙蔽當時賢明的太守的賢明的裁判，小生命終于得以挽回。這使人不得聯想到二千餘年前的猶太民族，無端分崩爲以列色和猶太兩國，成日自相厮殺，致使外族易於相乘；其間不知有沒有枉曲人以遂一已之私的僞士？眞欲起死人而問之。然而遠在兩千年後的今日，雖有賢明的「劈棺定讞」，其於猶太民族的漂流，有何補益呢？</p>
<h3>讀了婦人心以後</h3>
<p>— 蘭如</p>
<p>|獻給先女士|</p>
<p>不相識的先女士：</p>
<p>在四月二十二日的婦女園地（第十期）上讀了你的婦人心以後，使我發生了很多感想：你的確是「太好了！」爲了一個並不是眞心愛自已，欺騙自已的丈夫，竟犧牲了自已可寶貴的靑春，甚至一生，如果再不覺悟的話。</p>
<p>你是這樣迫切地希望人家告訴你，「對，或不對」，你是這樣熱烈地「只求人間眞正的同情，公理最後的批判，」我就是要告訴你「不對」的一人，我的話也許有些地方過於坦白，直率，不漂亮點說，過於粗魯，但請你相信我是純粹的善意，而且是萬分同情你的女性朋友||雖然還沒有見過面，通過信，我敢相信，全中國甚至全世界的被壓迫婦女，男子，都是我們的好朋友。</p>
<p>你承認自已是個弱者，半點也不寃枉，而且我更要說一句，你是「太懦弱」</p>
<p>了！</p>
<p>女人是最富於情感的，因此常常被情感所誤；女人最容易受欺騙，除開金錢，地位，名譽，不說，只要有幾句甜蜜蜜的情話，幾封蜜甜甜的情書，就可得到一顆純潔的，熱烈的少女的心；女人最容易受感動，只要求愛者以自殺爲要挾，以吐血害相思病來求愛，很少有拒絕的，你，洗女士，你就是這樣的女人，因此你陷入了苦海，造成了苦痛的現實，渺茫的前途！</p>
<p>你爲什麼不能在最初拒絕他的要挾就是因爲你太容易受感動，太沒有勇氣了！你並不是自已怎樣熱戀着他，而是他以「自殺」，寫「血書」來强迫你嫁他，這已經是不能成功，不是美滿的婚姻了，而况同居了五年後，你们还是過着「性，與性情不調和」的生活，並且他有時還打你，唉！爲什麼你的忍耐心這樣好呢？</p>
<p>在你們過着極端衝突生活的時候，你沒有勇氣和他離婚，這自然是封建社會的所謂道德，人格等等在支配着你，恐怕力量更大的，還是在三個孩子，唉·女人，女人，不死於丈夫手裏，便要犧牲在孩子的身上！你爲什麼不想想，孩子將來長大了是社會的，不是我個人的，爲什麼我要整天做他們的牛馬，辛辛苦苦來帶着他？孤兒院，育嬰堂，難道不可以送去嗎？</p>
<p>明知他另和第三個女人同居一年多了，而且生了孩子，你還相信他的騙術嗎？爲什麼要把孩子送給他，以祈和他藕斷絲連呢？到了這時候，你應該澈底覺悟了！不再受他的欺騙，受他甜言蜜語的引誘，「懺悔」）？這是他們的慣技，你爲什麼能這樣大慈大悲，寬恕他，可憐他呢？</p>
<p>你懊悔不該帶孩子回湖南而不懐疑他，這是大可不必的事，愛情旣到了用手段欺騙對方的時候，一切都完了，你卽使不回湖南，又有什麼用呢？</p>
<p>現在事已至此，悲哀無益，我希望你完全覺悟過來，從新做一個有思想，有志願，有勇氣的新女性·不再在愛情的苦海裏浮沉，不再爲孩子受苦難，你應該爲求解放而奮鬥，不要依賴公理最後的批判，你應該求自已的獨立，不希求人間的同情，固然，公理與同情，無論在什麼地方都可找到，但　大家同情你，是爲了可憐你的原故，我們要做一個不受人家可憐的人！</p>
<p>趕快拋棄你的孩子，將他交給社會去管理吧，你不要爲了他們而犧牲了自已的一生；但如果你萬一要做個舊社會的賢妻良母，當然這是你的自由，誰也不能干涉。</p>
<p>我寫的太嚕囌，其實應該只說出（不對）兩字便得了，祝女士奮鬥！</p>
<h3>新生兒的養育法</h3>
<p>— 友白</p>
<p>小孩自初生至臍帶落下的十日間，謂之新生兒時代，新生兒時代是人生的開始，其養育法的適宜與否，對於將來的健康，有莫大的關係。茲舉其最要的幾點說明如左：</p>
<p>抱着睡的害處　有不少做母親的，喜歡抱着孩子睡，本意原是愛他。那知結果適得其反，不但有妨母親的睡眠，且使剛出世的嬰孩不能得到自由的安睡。母子同受其害，造成了將來的禍根，這時期是母子須要絕對休養的時候，要使母子都能用自由的姿勢，得到十分充足睡眠，那末除分牀獨寐，別無良法了。　　哺乳的時間　盡間每二小時一次，夜�</p>
<p>間每四小時一次，養成其習慣，可不疏忽。哺乳時間以十分鐘爲度。</p>
<p>乳兒的保溫　乳兒未離母體前，原是母體的一部，現在驟然離開了溫暖的母體，單獨生活，要是沒有完備的調節體溫的裝置，是極易受寒的。所以保溫在育兒法中，也佔着重要的位置。</p>
<p>臍和病毒臍帶是乳兒疾病重要的入口，生後卽行剪去，其傷口之全愈，必須經過二三日。如果從這未愈的傷口裏侵入了黴菌，會發生種種可怕的病症的，如破傷風，敗血症，丹毒，肺炎等。要免除這些危險，須注意臍帶的清潔與乾燥二點。臍帶漸漸乾燄，一星期後就會自然地落下。</p>
<p>入浴與臍　新生兒應否入浴，論者不一。蓋生後三星期間，臍部還不是眞正的皮膚，入浴時，黴菌極易侵入。故浴後必須覆以乾燥的紗布，使之十分乾燥　入浴　入浴的時間；每次五分至十分，溫度以攝氏三十八九度爲宜。法以左臂前腕托其胸，使沈於水，右手以硼酸肥皂輕輕地擦着，尤宜注意腋下股間等處。然後將全身拭乾，撤以少刺戟性的粉末，以防皮膚之腐爛。</p>
<p>大便　新生兒在出世的那天或翌日，排出黑糞，「稍帶線色」呌做胎便，是腸中的廢物及胎兒時所飲羊水等的混合物。飲乳後其形頓變，卽所謂人乳便，係卵黃狀之軟物，普通每日一二次。</p>
<h3>法令摘要</h3>
<p>本刊爲謀增進婦女法律智識起見，自本期起，特闢法令摘要二欄，節綠直接有關婦女生活之各種法令，以供參閱。編者</p>
<p>民法親屬篇|民國十九年十二月公佈，二十年五月五日起施行。其條文如次：</p>
<p>第一章　通則</p>
<p>第九百六十七條　稱直系血親者，謂已身所　　從出，或從已身所出之血親。稱旁系血親　　者，謂非直系血親，而與已身出於同源之　　血親。</p>
<p>第九百六十八條　血親親等之計算，直系血　　親從已身上下數，以一世爲一親等，旁系　　血親從已身數至同源之直系血親，再由同　　源之直系血親數至與之計算等之血親，以　　其總世數爲親等之數。</p>
<p>第九百六十九條　稱姻親者，調血親之配偶　　，配偶之血親，及配偶之血親之配偶。</p>
<p>第九百七十條　姻親之親系及親等之計算如　　左：</p>
<p>（一）血親之配偶，從其配偶之親系及親等。　　（二）配偶之血親，從其與配偶之親系及親等　　（三）配偶之血親之配偶，從其與配偶之親系　　及親等。</p>
<p>第九百七十一條　姻親關係因離婚而消滅，　　夫死妻再婚或妻死贅夫再婚時，亦同。</p>
<h3>睡眠與食物</h3>
<p>— 蕪</p>
<p>睡眠是天然的補藥，但世界文明，失眠症隨時代而日增，療治失眠，固有種種方法，而食物與睡眠亦大有影響。茲將助眠食物與妨碍睡眠食物之種類與理由分述如下：</p>
<p>助眠食物　果物，蘿葡，等含有消化酵素，可助食物消化，因消化而腹中滯留减少，自然地安眠了。至于馬鈴薯，芋艿因澱粉之較難消化，容易腹脹頭重，影響睡眠，但芋的纖維，果類之果酸，均有通便之效，這亦是促成安眠條件之一。　　妨害安睡的食物　牛乳，蛋白，肉類等均屬蛋白質，易使腹脹，而影響神經，頭重，不知不覺中，難入眠鄕，他如茶，咖啡等興奮劑，胡椒，茴香等刺戟物，均易使人興奮而陷于失眠。</p>
<h3>一個世界的女飛行家</h3>
<p>— 徐學文</p>
<p>||阿美瓊森||</p>
<p>現在的飛行事業，大有一日千里之勢了，女子投身航空界的，也逐漸地增多，長距離的飛行，以一九二六年德國老博士愛克納，駕着齊柏林飛機週繞地球那次，最爲轟動世界。其次，一九二七年美國飛行家林白，駕着單人飛機飛過大西洋，也爲一般人所驚嘆不巳的。可是，到了一九三O年，竟有一個英勇的女飛行家出世了，她的名字呌阿美瓊森AmyJohnson，英國籍，以十九日的行程，從英格蘭飛到澳大利亞。路綫之長，三倍於飛越大西洋。</p>
<p>她的出身及最初的飛行</p>
<p>阿美瓊森的祖父，是個丹麥人，在十六歲時到英國赫爾地方居住，從事漁業，後來阿美約翰生的父親，也住在赫爾操漁業了。　所以阿美瓊森是個漁人之女。</p>
<p>她幼年就喜聽冒險的故事。一種活潑的天性，快樂的精神，絕不像一個幽嫺多慮的閨女。年長以後，常到海岸邊練習手　的打靶。在二十二歲時，携了幼妹，乘坐飛機環行赫爾。那時她覺得自已高高的飛翔於蔚藍的天空，穿過潔白的雪堆，未幾又向碧綠的大地徐徐降落，眞是何等新鮮而又超越的一種生活呀。她對飛行感覺到特別的快樂，這是她第一次的嘗試，只化了五個先令。</p>

<p>自此以後，阿美瓊森對於飛行生活的興趣，一天一天的濃厚起來了。她仰首瞧見天空中盤旋着的飛機，就豔羨個不已。她常常想：（要是我也能駕駛飛機，在空中旋繞着遊瞰各地，　那麽何等快活呢？）那時她在倫敦。一個律師事務室中做書記，只是感到生活的呆板。且倫敦的街巿，又很煩囂的，她天天坐着公共汽車趕那辦公的時間，實在感不到新異的趣味。</p>
<p>可是，練習飛行，是一件奢侈的事；她以一個書記員的收入，那裏能够辦到呢？所以她雖是心裏羨慕，却也只有睜大眼瞧着人家的横行天空呀。</p>
<p>後來，她知道有一個地方，可以較底的代價去練習飛行，於是她於一九二八年九月，以一個對於飛機毫無所知的女子，毅然决然地進入了倫敦飛行俱樂部。</p>
<p>呆坐在事務室中的書記的職業，這是當然更感不到興趣了；但是，她仍極力支持着。因爲，在初學的時候失去了職業，會於事業的前途莫大的打擊的，她以這樣的心情一面從事工作，一面致意於其富有興趣的事業；因此她就比平日更加勤奮了。</p>
<p>忙碌的生活</p>
<p>她停止了一切游泳，綱球，跳舞，省下錢來去學習飛行功課，那俱樂部的飛行功課，每小時的代價爲一鎊；所以她每星期必須省下十個先令，積了兩週，便可去繳納飛行功課的學費。俱樂部裏的敎師很器重她，第一次携帶她繞飛飛行塲半小時，以後就讓她一個人練習。於是她每天的生活忙碌極了，從九點到五點，是在事務室中做書記。從早晨六點到九點，及從下午五點到中夜，她要穿起飛行裝去學習駕駛，她不但要熱習飛行技能，還得學習飛行的理論。她漸漸存心要以飛行爲職業了。於是，她就决意投工程師漢姆做學徒，以便實地學習飛行機的機械學。因此，她於練習飛行之餘，將所有的時間，都化在拆卸引擎，和裝置引擎的工作上。此後，又進而習機械學，及機身各部的結構。</p>
<p>兩次飛行的成績</p>
<p>阿美瓊森加入飛行俱樂部不久，進步却異常的迅速，於是就在九月十五日作第一次的試飛，計自加入後只有兩星期呢；這天，兩人駕駛，但天有風，有雨又有霧，她毫不怯餒，和同伴飛行了十五小時餘，次年六月九日，她又飛行了，這次單人駕駛，却竟得到了特異的成績　於是，在六月三十六日，就獲到了私人飛機駕駛者的證書，未幾，又得到飛行塲工程師的證書，她獲得這個證書，在全英女子中爲第一人。</p>
<p>所以老師漢姆對人這樣的這樣的稱讚她道：這次阿美瓊森的飛行，可以使一般人想像想像她是如何的一個人了，要知道，作這樣的一回飛行，須有極大的體力上，忍受性，她在飛行中，不但要駕撥機械，看視地圖，還要用喞筒喞取汽油，灌入注油的槽中，所以，要喞取五十加侖的油，則右手須有三千次的動作，</p>
<p>看了上述一段話我們也可知道她强健的體格，與其耐勞忍苦的對付工作了，</p>
<p>飛行澳洲的動機及挫折</p>
<p>由兩次飛行成績的驚異，於是她想决意做個職業的飛行人了，可是，做商航駕駛人，須有一百小時的飛行經騐，她的飛行，先後總共九十小時又四十五分時，那麼她是不能得到商航駕駛人的證書的，這是第一種困難，還有，她卽使得作飛機售賣員，那顧主一定因爲她是女性，决不高興由她領着去作試飛的，這是第二種困難，</p>
<p>她終於决定一九三O年，五月五日出發作一次長途飛行，就是從英格蘭到澳大利亞，給人們看看她這樣偉大的飛行，同時就藉此而獲到那張商航駕駛人證書。</p>
<p>可是，一般的譏諷却也就此來了，在她出發前一個月，澳洲有一家報紙風聞了這消息，便引載了某飛行家的一段話，說：（這是姑娘家一時的空想，竟想要作這樣的飛行，）她氣極了，將這段話剪了下來，說到澳洲時，定要將這當面摔在那人的臉上，</p>
<p>她一面又請求　某火油公司的總經理帮助，但是结果反而勸她勿作此行，後來又請求好多人，但不是諷刺，便是直截爽快的拒絕她，</p>
<p>最後，她想到請報館方面的人贊助了，因爲，報館是本來歡迎一般人作冒險旅行的，他們願意預付以費用，而購得其人旅行的日記，以爲異地新聞的材料，但是，她把這計劃告訴後，也得到一個失望！他們說：（這嘗試，太艱難了，恐怕不會有結果吧？）於是，她在他們一個（恐怕）的假定之下，只得報着顔退出了，数次奔走的结果，都歸無效，眞是她一生最大的刺激呀，</p>
<p>出發與歸來</p>
<p>終於最後的機會來了，她由父親和朋友的帮助，籌得了三千金元購一飛機，於是她脫離了安定的書記生活，而冒着長途飛行的艱險了，</p>
<p>那架飛機，因價廉之故，裝置很不完全，機中只有一架引擎，又沒有無綫電；並且到澳洲的路綫，又是世界最可怕的航空綫之一，非有職業技能的從沒有駕駛過，但是，她竟於五月五日，不聲不響地獨自乘機開向澳洲了，在那裏，她只知道有一個澳洲女子，那還是人家所介紹的，可是，她費了十九天的行程，於五月二十四日果然到達目的地了！她好不快樂呀！回來之日，倫敦的新聞記者，都來向她道歉，並佯作不知她出發的消息，以取得她在行程中的記綠，每日郵報一家，忽然電滙給她五萬金元，祝賀她的凱旋，總之她回來之日，人們已用盡其恭敬與禮節了，</p>

<h3>再論廢除隔日收現問題</h3>
<p>— 潘恒勤</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>我當下筆之先、有二義當爲讀者告：其一，關於廢除匯劃隔日收現一事，爲不倿對於我國整個金融建設之第二步意見，（第一步竟見，卽主張由兩元並交而廢兩改元也，）此原係個人一種客觀的研究，並非空言改革，爲人喉舌，或有任何作用與背景，存乎其間，其二，不倿認定滙劃隔日收現爲一事，而一二八時期，之祇准匯劃，不准取現爲又一事，界限分明，不相牽纏，明乎此，然後請讀我下文，</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>查廢除匯劃隔日收現之議，初非自我而倡，正如兩元並交等說之前人已有先我而言之者矣，　我不過及時重提，喚起注意而巳，溯當民九高唱廢兩之際，徐寄廎氏曾撰（廢兩改元先自廢匯劃銀始）一文，刋登銀行週報，至不倿之爲文主張改革此事，係在上年財部命令實行廢兩之後，所以不於實行廢兩之際，同時倡議廢除滙劃隔日收現者，實爲一部分金融業着想，正因深知個中底蘊，雅不欲操切從事，致多無謂之週折，本年一月，馬寅初氏在申報月刋所發表之（中國金融制度之缺點與其改革方案）一文，其中關於統一幣制一節，深幸與鄙見不謀而合，最近因聞杭巿劃洋有於六月一日取消之說，爰不揣譾陋，續擬辦法數條，刋佈報端，以期及時改革，惟恐管窺蠡測，無當大雅，且原文簡略，難免不引起一部分人士無謂之反響，淆惑聽聞，用再拉雜申論，倘閱者不以其人微言輕，進而敎之，則幸甚矣，</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>論錢業之滙劃制度，原等於銀行之交換制度，可以節省通貨，不倿贊成之不㗇，安有表示不滿之理，所欲提出研究，而不能已於言者，不過因匯劃收解，在錢業同業間，則可於當日收現，而於銀行及非同業，則須隔日收現耳，考此種隔日收現之辦法，相沿已久，固亦不能謂其於歷史上無相當之價値，蓋在昔銀兩時代，進出手續甚繁，往往當日收解不及，是以對於同業以外之收欵者，不得不於次日解出，此其一也，又當中外互巿之初，本國金融業資力不充，籌碼缺乏，而隔日收現，則准備調撥，可多一日之猶豫，此其二也，顧今之巿塲情形，則已逈異於昔矣，自九一八以來，現金集中都巿，銀錢業籌碼鬆濫，達於極點，卽就最近調查所得而言，本年五月十七日，上海銀元之存底，爲三萬五千三百九十三萬元，內華商銀行計占二萬零六百七十三萬元之譜，且軟幣信用鞏固，流通日廣，籌碼旣無不足之虞，而銀兩已廢，收解祇有銀元一種，不論軟幣硬幣，均無當日不及收解之理，是則錢業之滙劃收解，大可及時改革，對於銀行及非同業，又安用隔日收現爲哉，</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>或謂錢業匯劃收解，其對於銀行及非同業之所以須隔日收現者，實以洋商銀行有壟斷上海金融之野心，不受錢莊匯劃制度之拘束，必欲提現，入彼銀庫，故特規定隔日付現，以示限制，所謂滙劃制度，卽爲華商金融業抵制外商經濟侵略之惟一防綫，藉以打破其壟斷金融之迷夢云，此說之似是而非，我知雖三尺之童，亦將啞然失笑，蓋隔日收現，旣爲抵制外商而設，則對於本國銀行及非同業，何以亦須隔日收現，且數十年來，爲問匯劃隔日收現之抵制外商壟斷金融，其成績爲何如耶，旣能規定隔日付現，曷不規定多隔若干時期，以抵制之耶，隔日付現，在外商表面，雖似吃虧，庸知外商對於隔日收現之損耗，巳暗加於貨價或成本之中，仍爲我錢業以外之華商，受其損耶，夫列强在華之經濟侵略，壟斷金融，誠屬無微不至，設使我國不及時設立銀行，採用相當之制度，發行鈔票，則迄今外鈔之將充斥於國中可知也，錢業憂國心長，夙所欽仰，所惜當</p>
<p>時未能早與一般直接間接之在經濟侵略下交易者，斷絕往來，否則卽使政治不上軌道，我知其收獲，較諸用匯劃隔日收現方法，以空言抵制者，豈可同日而語耶，</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>嘗聞主張滙劃隔日收現者言，滙劃收解，對於銀行及非同業之隔日收現，有益金融，無損各界，此亦非眞相之談，蓋就一般顧客言，晚近欵項出入，事實上有滙劃票，亦有非滙劃票，儘有以現欵存入，而向開用之本票，則當日不能取現，如須取現，非倒塡早一日之日期，卽須隔一日方可，是卽無端使顧客損耗，一日之利息也，又如貨欵交易，一方購進原料，必須現欵帶往外埠，而一方售出商品，所收得者，爲當日之滙劃票，滙劃票必須隔日方可收現，茍欲貼現以抵付，則勢必致令顧客亦損耗一日之利息矣，至洋商行家，對於所收滙劃票據，不交洋商銀行，而與華商銀行開立往來，則正因該洋商行家，有滙劃付欵頭寸，而不肯損耗，並擔負風險，豈足以言保主權也哉，再就華商銀行一方面言之，一般華商銀行，因便利顧客收付起見，不得不亦用滙劃進出，蓋不用滙劃，而以劃頭爲本位，則顧客如以滙劃票交入者，勢必致遲一日收帳，令顧客不滿，查中國銀行與交通銀行，雖於民國六年五月一日，及二十一年四月一日起，先後實行收現解現，但各該行於近數年來所分設之當地辦事處，亦莫不兼用滙劃進出，第華商銀行之用滙劃收解，不能在錢業之滙劃總會內，辦理滙劃，除一部分交換銀行之票據，可在交換所中軋抵外，其餘大部分之滙劃票據，非假乎於錢莊，代爲收付不可，晚近銀行日多，錢莊則有减無增，銀行滙劃之收付爲數甚大，平日各銀行存放，錢莊，旣未免受制於人，而遇巿面緊張之際，風險爲可慮，此豈金融業之福哉，茲更就錢莊方面言之，錢莊利用滙劃隔日收現辦法，遇巿面需現，則提高劃頭加水，反是則劃頭去水，一面並使銀行滙劃進出，不得不經錢莊轉手，俾可吸收銀行頭寸，如上所述，就錢莊局部言，確屬有利而無弊，顧最近巿上游資充斥，一部分錢莊，對於銀行之存項，因須擔負風險，賠貼利息，是以亦並不歡迎，今昔情形不同，凡事責在因時制宜，此不倿之所以重提及時改革，俾收事半功倍之效也，</p>
<p>（六）</p>
<p>抑尤有言者，不倿之主張滙劃廢除隔日現，所以促進我金融業，謀整個之合作，正所謂欲發憤圖强，使洋商銀行在華無立足之地，設使自身制度紛歧，習故蹈常，尙何望洋商銀行之能恪遵政府法令哉，今之最爲駭人聽聞者，謂廢除滙劃隔日收現甚或釀成現金流盡，金融崩潰之局，又有謂滙劃轉帳制度，可以應付非常局面，以一二八時代爲證，並以當時中交兩行，對於解付電滙滙票，亦採用同業滙劃引爲口實者，殊不知滙劃之當日收現，現隔日收現，在錢業僅差一日之頭寸，何至現金流盡，金融崩潰，至一二八時代之滙劃情形，初非隔日收現，而係祇准滙劃，不准收現，事實有別，且當時茍非（一）中中交三行拆放鉅欵，（二）米糧等特種交易欵項，不獲通融以現金支付，（三）民衆愛護本國金融機關，則難關之是否得以穏渡，正未可知，論中交之以滙劃解付電滙滙票，良以對方旣祇以滙劃來，自亦不得不以滙劃去，安足以爲病，設使時賢迷信祇准滙劃，不准取現，爲穏渡難關之不二法門，則將來亦儘可用橫線支票方式，於橫線內塡明華商銀行或錢莊字樣，卽不致流入外商銀行之手，於廢除隔日收現何妨哉，</p>
<p>（七）</p>
<p>總之，滙劃隔日收現，與祇准滙劃，不准取現，係屬兩事，以平日一部分之隔日收現，改爲全部分之當日收現，並無困難，應付金融緊急之辦法，可偶用而不可常用，否則縱如何防禁維護，終不免於資金之逃避，此觀於各國禁金出口等辦法，非萬不得已，决不引用，可爲明證，至抵制洋商侵略，須從根本着手，而尤要者，金融業間，必須掃除合作障碍，俾可打成一片，使華商銀行及錢莊之信用，同時提高，眼光宜遠大，勿囿於局部之利害，此則區區鼓吹，廢除滙劃，隔日收現之微意，功成不</p>
<p>必自我，事實最爲雄辯，至究應如何實行廢除隔日收現之處，不倿曾擬有辦法三條，（一）由銀行業同業公會，通函會員銀行，定期將滙劃洋與劃頭洋，同時通用，滙劃票據，不得隔日收現，故交易票據，停止蓋用滙劃圖章，（二）由銀行業同業公會，函交換所，將交換銀行滙劃洋戶，定期轉入劃頭洋戶，合併記載，（三）由財政部命令錢業同業公會，滙劃欵項，對於銀行及非同業，定期一律當日付現，新交易票據，禁止加蓋滙劃圖章，（如能由錢業自動改革，如廢兩改元前之廢除二毫半，尤爲妥善，）是否有當，甚望當代金融業領袖，及政府當局，共同研究，廢兩改元之往事非遙，大可借鏡，邦人君子，其共鑒之，</p>

<p>業餘漫談</p>
<h3>歐美各國學徒生活</h3>
<p>— 熾</p>
<p>在我國的舊式商店以及一般手工業之中，一個人材的造就沒有一個不是從學徒中來的，卽在一般新式的商店或公司中的練習生，他們也是變過了名稱的學徒。在社會上一個很好的人材，並不一定是從學校中造成，往往是在學徒生活中苦練出來的，因之學徒的制度在社會上很牢固的存在着。　　学徒好像是我國所特有的一種習業方法，然而事實上並不如此。外國也有外國學徒存在着，並且在歐洲中部各地，學徒之制度盛行於社會中，職業界中的人物，也多半從學徒中產生。雖然是一個很著名的學校中出身的學生，但是做事並不一定比從學徒出身的能幹，刻苦的能力亦决定比不上的。</p>
<p>德國的總理是一個學漆匠的學徒出身。雖然他對於漆匠學徒的生活很不滿意，但是一個從學徒生活中煆煉出來的人，很信任學徒並不是低微的習業者，所以他是一個極力得倡改善學徒生活的人物。</p>
<p>外國的社會上雖然也有外國學徒，可是外國學徒的生活比較我國的學徒要優異很多。不過這種生活我們以爲優異，他們還是不滿意而預備着改良的。</p>
<p>英國的學徒以小規模的工商業居多，大工廠大商舗中不易看見。這種學徒的習業時期都没有一定，而須視能力如何而定。普通一個商店中的學徒，約一年左右卽可委派事務。平常每一星期的津貼亦可以得到五先令至十先令，頗足以維持生活。他們的工作，每天大約十小時左右。至於一個銀行中的學徒，那</p>
<p>麼快的祇要幾個月就可以作事，到一年還不能够作事的，那時候一定要請他去另行設法了。至於工廠中的學徒却不同了，他們練習期以一年爲最少限度，如果師傅認爲已經造就了的時候就可以去找工作做，不過没有一定限止應學習幾年的。</p>
<p>德國的學徒以工業界居多，商界在少數。平常一個鐵匠總有二三個學徒，他們都絕對的服從師傅。他們的學業期間雖然總在二年左右，但是對於一個工作特別優異者，幾個月之後就可以認爲學成。常常有一個學徒，學習了不久，工作比較他的師傅精良，這種靑出於藍的人物，他的師傅就用比較豐厚的待遇請他工作。那時候他的地位完全是一個夥伴，並不再視他如一個學徒了，當然，平庸的一個學徒是不能有這樣的機會的。在工業界如此，在商業界中却又逈異。一個寫字房裏面應當有幾個學徒，這種學徒的收入有時可以維持他的家庭生活。但是這種學徒，有時候升了職員，其所得的薪給倒反减少，因爲學徒收入並不規定，而職員薪給却是規定的。　　美國的學徒生活，比較歐洲各國的爲低微。美國的工商家踓然有很大的資金，但是他們對於低下人物待遇是非常苛刻的。所以在美國的學徒，卽使是銀行裏的一個練習生，每星期也僅有幾角錢的收入，還不够一人的麵包。無形之中美國學徒是不多了，結果亦决沒有像歐洲各國的學徒那樣的有進取心。</p>
<p>然而歐美各國的學徒，較之我國更有天壤之別。他們的待遇較我國的學徒爲優。我們希望社會上對於我國的學徒生活能酌予改善，更需要的是變更學習期限，像現在尙有的跟三年學三年的辦法，根本要加以剷除！</p>

<p>薪水，一學期只有三十担穀。我的天，三十担穀是多少錢呀？但爲了牠，我得坐兩天的長途小轎，跑到那只有山和田野的窮鄕僻壤裏去。這便是生活，這便是我在冬天流着汗開闢了好久的生活的道路！</p>

<p>祠堂巳經是百幾十年前的遣留物了，祭壇和戲台上塗金的雕刻，只餘下些淡漠的影子</p>
<p>，再加上給風雨毁了顔色的「讀書不忘革命」「三民主義萬歲」···那些紅綠標語陪襯着，更顯得暗淡無光了，雖然春已開始在樹梢尖着上淡淡的綠色，但我的心却像披着喪服一樣的說不出的慘淡。</p>
<p>學校裏有小學部和女子職業部兩班，我在那三十担穀的代價底下，得包辦職業部的全部文科，此外小學部所有的功課，除掉老校長自已敎了國文，黨義，習字以外，其餘都被劃分在我名下的範圍以内。這樣一來，我每天的課是在五小時以上了，此外還有各種各樣大批的課本要批改。三十担穀！三十担穀将要壓着我喘不過氣來呀！</p>
<p>校長，是X族唯一的讀書人，四十年前他曾是一個留學日本的水警學生。但舊時代是過去了，校長昔日的光榮也跟着過去了，現在他身上保留着的是和這腐舊了的祠堂一樣可憐的寒酸氣。據說X族的後輩爲了不使那一年三百担穀的公欵留着没用，和不忍自已的子弟再連田契都不認識，便開辦了這一所族學，而且「拯孤」樣的將牠同着那一筆可觀的經費交給了這孤獨的校長，作爲是解决了他的善後。他的妻，一個省城裏的女裁縫，使做職業部的縫絍敎員兼「訓育主任」。此外，他們還缺少一個需要「包羅萬象」的助手，便以三十担穀一學期的代價僱用着我到了那裏。</p>
<p>在這樣的情况之下，来當一個鄕村敎師，麻煩和吃力，是可以想像得到的了。</p>
<p>開學了，學生們紛紛由家長送到學校裏來。孩子們拖着鼻涕，在院子裏跑着呌着，就像發了瘋的小牛一様。職業部的女學生却完全兩様，背心裹垂着粗大的髮辦，兩個大褲脚管掩住了肥胖的大腿，驕傲的，歡樂的談笑着。當校長指着我向她們說：「快來行禮呀，這是你們的先生！「的時候，她們却像遇見陌生的男人一樣的紅着臉跑開了。</p>
<p>「假如我上課的時候，她們跑到什麼地方去呢？」我想着，笑了。</p>
<p>我拿着粉條踏上了那些纯樸的鄕姑娘們的講台。静静的，臉都低垂着，手直線的攏在腿上。點名時的回聲，要聳起耳邊才可以聽到。爲了使空氣活潑起來，我只好丟開書本，憑着我腦袋裏装着的東西，講些與她們有關的婦女問題各方面的事情，想引起她們發問甚至是討論，但結果是失敗了。她們一直是靜着，没有誰抬一下頭。下課鈴響了，我冷冷地退下台來，一隻脚剛出門，敎室裏一陣大笑突然爆發出來。我像木鷄似的呆住了</p>
<p>由職業部的課堂裏，轉到小學部的課堂來，就像從廟宇跑進了戲院裏一樣。</p>
<p>孩子們喧嚷着，歪歪斜斜地坐在他們座位裏面，吐痰，吵駡，年小的哭，年長的笑，非等到你像私塾的敎師一樣，拿着「戒尺」噼噼拍拍響起來，他們是不會靜止的。但一會兒又：「先生，他偷了我的石筆！」「先生，我的墨盒不見了。」的喊起來。</p>
<p>敎室裏，僅只三十多個人却分做三班。最小的四歳都有，大的已是强壯的小農夫了。在一個鐘頭裏面，要敎完三課不同样的書。職業部也一樣，十六個學生分做三班，有一班只有兩個人，而對于那兩個人也得一樣的把課文從頭至尾講了又講。下午三點鐘一過，成堆的課本　堆到案頭來了：將近六十本的作文（校長眼睛老了看不淸，所以小學生的作文也由我看）和將近六十本的算術，此外還有各種各樣的筆記簿，大小字的抄本···這些東西，非一直到夜闌人靜了，你是沒有方法弄淸楚的。</p>
<p>就這樣，每天照規的生活着：吃飯，上課，改課本；没，有報看，也没有朋友的來信；看着孩子們在院子裏野牛似的呌跳，女學生們躱在樓上含羞</p>
<p>的低語···讓生命在這樸實而又混濁的空氣中泥河似的流走，我不知道祠堂以外的世界，祠堂以外的人們也將我忘記了。　　春天的太陽愉快地笑着，躺在牠懷抱底下的田野的土鬆軟起來，塘岸的小草染上豔綠的顏料了，溪水在山澗裏活潑的爬着。田堘上印满人和牛的脚印，是揷秧的時候了。</p>
<p>嘈雜的孩子們的課堂裏，人數驟然的减少起來，女學生也紛紛請假回家了。「到底是怎麽回事呀？」我向校長。　　「回家帮忙揷秧呢。」校長若無其事的回答。</p>
<p>「爲什麽學校裏不正式掛牌放假？」</p>
<p>一掛牌那又不必了，反正在鄕下，是學校就學生，不是學生就學校，要是管束得嚴厲一點，那簡直沒有人上門了。馬虎點倒大家落得淸閒無事。「校長搖着頭瀟灑地說着，背着釣竿向塘邊走去，那樣子倒的確是淸閒得悠然自樂。</p>
<p>我使在這淸閒無事」的當中休息了幾天。</p>
<p>禾秧在水田裏抽出綠苗了，學生們仍然回到學校裏來，但野多了，而且不時要自動的提早回家去，因爲在「農忙」時候，讀書是比一切都要不重要的。女學生們却留校的多，敎室裏的空氣也比以前活潑了不少，她們已不再見着我就低頭</p>
<p>，而且漸漸和我親熱起來。望着她們那筆直地垂在背心中央的粗髪辯，我覺得自已一身都笨重起來。幾次勸她們剪掉，都沒有接受，但最後一次，一個年紀最小的女孩子勇敢地向我說了：「那末，請先生替我剪吧！」從那一個開始，沒有</p>
<p>一星期工夫十六個女孩都像上戰塲的勇士一般的，讓她們的秀髪在我的剪刀底下犧牲了。　　一直是坐在塘邊垂釣的校長，近來忽然忙碌起來。他告訴我：視學員要來了從淸早到黑晚，他親自監視着那廚司兼校役的小夥子將學校裏（不，祠堂裏）打掃得淸淸爽爽，買些紅綠紙寫上「歡迎」的標語，以前那些毀了顏色的是給撕掉了。好像下總動員令似的將</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>所有的學生都呌了來，穿着新衣服，整整齊齊坐在敎室裏不許動。同時還在外面請了很多野孩子來塡補那些空餘的座位。職業部的敎室裏，新添了臨時租來的幾部縫衣機，請來的學生更多，幾乎超過了原有的數目。</p>
<p>在校長幾天忙碌的張羅之後，視學員像神像一樣的被三人轎抬到了學校裏，陪侍的人（是由隣近其他的小學校請來的校長校董之類的人物）從頭門口接了進來，祭壇裏陳設了大魚大肉豐盛的筵席，作爲入門的招待。飯後，視學員由校長「奉陪」着每個敎室「參觀」了一會，含着笑坐着原來的轎字走了　。</p>
<p>一算是敷衍過去了，看可不可以弄到甲等「津貼」···一校長如釋重負似的嘆了一口氣，又從門背後把他的釣竿拿出來，學校裏的空氣頓時又鬆懈了。孩子們上「國文」課的時候找不着校長，便從書包裏拖出在家裏「發蒙」時所讀的「三子經」「雜字」···等「順口的書」有節奏的唱歌似的讀起來。</p>
<p>在火毒的太陽底下，學校悄悄地放了假，學生像林鳥似的飛散了。我帶着四個整月的薪水，三十担穀換來的六十塊錢，又向另外的生活途徑出發了。</p>
<h3>法西斯蒂與中國民族解放運動</h3>
<p>— 致實</p>
<p>中國民族的命運，已顯現萬分的悲慘；中國民族的地位，已頻於奴隷的危境。我們不起來反抗，便只有死路一條！無疑義的，民族解放運動，已成爲目前整個中國民族迫切的要求。</p>
<p>但是，怎樣去幹我們的民族解放運動呢？</p>
<p>我們須要有法西斯蒂的負責硬幹的精神！和法西斯蒂强硬的鐵腕的政策！</p>
<p>什麼呌作負責硬幹的精神呢？墨索里尼說得好：「我們的綱領，是很簡單的：我們要統治意大利！要談到「綱領」的話，那是多得很！意大利並不缺乏謀幸福的綱領，意大利缺乏的是幹事的人和幹事的志願！···法西主義現在就要把意大利民族四千七百萬人的担子放在自已的臂膀上，負担起最可怕的責任來！」墨氏又說：「法西主義不是一個政黨的政綱，牠是一種運動。牠並不需要製造一個長期實現的綱領、牠只是一天一天的建設牠所要幹的解救意大利的制度！」這就是說，遇事不尙空談，只求實行，不知推諉，自已挻身出來負責，有了這種負責硬幹的精神，纔可以開始民族解放的運動！</p>
<p>不過，法西斯蒂負責硬幹的精神，不是「朕卽國家」的路易十四的個人專制的精神，更不是俄國革命前期虛無黨「個人自由直接行動」的精神！法西斯蒂的負責硬幹的精神，乃是民族圑結的有組織和紀律的負責硬幹的精神！　　何謂民族圑結的精神呢？這說是說，一個整個的民族，不論是資產階級，小資產階級或無產階級，在誓死反對帝國主義，力求民族解放的共同意志之下。一致團結起來，共同作有力量的鬥爭。法國法西斯蒂的領袖伐洛亞在他所著的民族革命一書內說道：「民族革命乃是一種全體的革命。牠並是一種改良的總合，牠是推翻資產階級的，自由的，民主的，代議制度的國家。牠旣不站在右派資產階級政黨的立塲，也不站在左派社會主義政黨的立塲。牠們是站在一切階級和政黨的上面，牠們是整個民族（原文爲整個法國）的黨，包括各種各樣的人物。」伐氏又在高爾歌里尼所著的法西斯蒂革命記底序文裏說道：「事實上，法西主義乃是智識分子，戰士，及工農羣衆統一在一種反對民主的資產階級底卑汚行動的共同運動中的工作，也可以說是對於自由的資產階級政府使意大利日趨衰弱的一種反抗。」他又說：「···這種民團（指意大利法西斯蒂的民團）是怎樣組織起來的呢？最初，是由參加歐戰的戰士，學生，藝術家，僱員，工人及農民集合而成；倘若考察這些團員的政治來源的話，這裏面包括有王黨，有共和派，有社會主義者，···精密地說，這是一種有組織的優秀分子的集團，這是站在一切精神上面的集團，這是新意大利的靈魂，戰鬥的意大利···」因此，我們知道，民族團結乃是法西斯蒂一切行動的基本要素。</p>
<p>何謂有組織有紀律的精神呢？這就是說，集中民族中散漫的力量，成爲一種集體的力量；集中各個爲戰的散兵成爲有指揮有命令有隊伍的戰鬥團體。所謂組織就是集合許多分散的個人，形成一個有機的單一體；每個個人都是這單一體的一部分，這單一體便是每個個人的總合。組織的力量越擴大，便越累進地增加其力量，以至於發生質的轉變，所謂紀律，便是絕對的服從。服從團體的信條，服從團體的領導與機關的命令，好比戰時的軍隊服從其長官的命令一樣。這種紀律，是任何戰鬥團體的要素，缺乏了這種紀律什麼行動也不能發生效力。</p>
<p>民族團體的組織和紀律旣已具備之後，便要開始執行種種必要的强硬政策。我們以意大利法西斯蒂爲例，再參酌中國特殊情形，最低限度，應執行下列三大强硬政策：</p>
<p>（一）强硬的外交政策　　帝國主義者侵略中國民族，牠的工具，便是政治經濟的力量：政治的力量，是陸海空軍的軍事勢力；經濟的力量，是商品侵略和投資。我們要抵抗牠，也只有用「力」之一途。牠以軍事勢力來威嚇我們，我們便以軍事勢力去對牠；牠以經濟力來乘侵略我們，我們便以經濟力量來抵制牠</p>
<p>。絕不使中國的主權和領土有絲毫的損失；絕不使中國民族的利益，有絲毫的犧牲。我們要凖備長期抵抗，要準備我們的力，使用我們的力，去澈底反抗任何帝國主義者的侵略，那便是我們的强硬外交政策！</p>
<p>（二）强硬的經濟政策　　我們一方面旣要抵制帝國主義者的侵略，另一方面又要解决民生問題，以求民族切實的團結，勢非由政府實行一種有計劃的統治經濟不可！我國的統治經濟，依目前特殊的情形看來，應切實執行民生主義中底節制資本和平均地權兩大辦法，並實現國家資本的建設。一切帝國主義者的箝制和國內資本家地主的反對，我們都可以不顧，採取這種原則而製定有計劃的統治經濟，才是中國民族迫切需要的經濟政策！</p>
<p>（三）强硬的中央獨裁政策　　虛僞的民主政治，在資本主義國度內固已發生相當的作用；但在現在階級鬥爭尖銳化的今日，民主政治已失了統治的作用。中國不是資本主義的國家，而是一種半殖民地半封建的國家，一方面旣需要訓練人民的政治力量，另一方面又要執行强硬外交政策和經濟政策，爲免除買辦資本家地主底反抗，爲統一全國力量的指揮，應實行中央集權的獨裁政策。這種獨裁制是民族解放運動中不可避免的一個歷程而不是長期的政治制度，所以只能名之爲政策。</p>
<p>我們相信，中國民族在這種有組織和有紀律的執行强硬政策的戰鬥團體努力之下，必能獲得完全的解放與自由。</p>

<h3>蘇聯的樂器工業</h3>
<p>— 君實</p>
<p>樂器的生產是蘇聯工業中的一支，僅是從一九二四||二五年間才開始被注意到的。</p>
<p>這一支新工業基礎的奠定，將是第二五年計劃努力目標之一。不過。，在第一五年計劃中，樂器的質量上的改進和數量上的增加，較之大戰前這方面的紀錄已是大大地超過的了。</p>
<p>跟着第一五年計劃的進展，樂器的工塲的大規模生產和手工塲的小規模生產，其數値已從一九二八年的一千萬盧布升到一九三二年的七千萬盧布。在那五年中，除了私人經營的不算，光是國營樂器生產的數値已有九千一百萬盧布之多。革命前，舊俄所用的樂器是大半以原料品或半製造品的形式向外國購運進口的。那時的少數樂器業的經營，全是握在外國資本家和專門家手裏。在舊俄領域內的樂器製造廠，全爲外國專門家所控制，俄國工人是無法知道樂器的詳細製造過程的，他們僅是爲了搬運由外國買來的原料和裝配零件這兩件事而被僱用着。</p>
<p>雖然某種樂器，如弦琴與手風琴之類，是舊俄能自已製造的，但大半的樂器仍不能不有待於外貨的輸入。</p>
<p>到現在，蘇聯在這方面已全不用依靠外貨了。各種樂器，如風琴，鋼琴，留聲機，留聲機片，提琴···等的製造技術，已全爲蘇聯樂器工人所熟習了。　　樂器的原料，半製成的材料及零件，不久以前雖仍是由外國輸入的，但到現在已完全改用國貨了。</p>
<p>現就第一五年計劃末年樂器生產數量列表如下：</p>
<p>鋼琴類·········四·五OO件　　　風琴類········六二·二OO件弦樂器類，如gultars，mandoling，　　　　　balaikas，violins等·····　　　　　一·O三八三OO件</p>
<p>手風琴類···二OO·OOO件　　留聲機····三二二·OOO件　　留聲機片　四·五四O·OOO件　　樂器之所以有這樣大量的需要，無疑的是因爲勞動業衆文化水平　提高和生活環境的改善的結果。</p>
<p>樂器工業的機械生產替代手工生產，在過去數年中已有了顯著的進步。這使樂器在生產數量上可大大增加，而價格可降低至最小限度。現在，主要樂器，特別是留聲機類的製造，是全部機械化了的。</p>
<p>還有値得提起的是不久以前已在克魯木那建造了一個樂器工廠，規定每年要在那裏製造五十萬架留聲機。又有一個專造弦樂器（如vikolins，cellos，contrabasses等）的新工廠也快要建築成功了（關於樂器工業的新原料的供給，亦正在研究和實騐中。這使樂器的經營略帶點地方性：有若干共和國是專在某一方面特別努力的。如喬治亞是特別注意於鋼琴類和民族樂器類的大製造工塲的建立。烏克蘭有一個樂器托辣斯單注意於極有計劃的生產鋼琴，風琴，手風琴，和較簡單的弦樂器。之類，等等。</p>
<p>爲了免除樂器製造科學上和實騐上的缺點，一個樂器技術研究所，在著名物理學家和聲學家安德列夫敎授的領導下已經建立成功了。這研究所正密切注意着各種樂器的監製。還有，各樂器製造機關也都已建立了牠們的實騐室。</p>
<p>替代了革命前樂器製造技術訓練學校的缺乏，現在蘇聯已開辦了多所訓練樂器工人的工塲學徒學校了。樂器製造專門家已在大量的生長着。</p>
<p>無疑的，在蘇聯第二五年計劃中，樂器工業將是輕工業必然高速發展的一支，因爲這方面的無限可能已預示給我們了。</p>

<h3>英美能一致對日乎</h3>
<p>— 森然</p>
<p>在中國巿塲上，不消說英日美的衝突是最直接最尖銳的。因此，當着日本不斷地向中國進攻的時候，有些外交界專家便說我們應該聯絡英美以制日；倘然英美能一致對日，那我們之收回東北失地，廢除中日間一切不平等條約，乃至獲得中華民族的完全解放，便就不成問題了。其實，在目前形勢下，英美是否眞能一致對日，尙是很大的疑問。</p>
<p>歐戰以後，美國金融資本主義勢力的發展，早已給了大不列顚帝國以很大的威脅。在加拿大，在南洋羣島，在印度的巿塲上，金元王國的經濟勢力都在日益增長，大有驅逐英人勢力而代之的形勢，至於世界經濟中心之由倫敦移於紐約，英美海軍比率之同等，大英帝國海上霸權之被侵奪，則更是戰後英國勢力衰落，美國氣焰高漲的表現。在此情形下，老大的英國當然在拚命奮鬥，以圖挽回其世界覇權。於是，英美爭覇的衝突，便成爲了目前世界形勢的主要的一面。</p>
<p>英國爲要消滅其衰落趨勢，並挽回世界覇權，便不得不以大部分的力量去對付美國。自然日本在遠東的過分行動，也是倫敦所不開心的，但在國際帝國主義的相互衝突中，英美的矛盾無論如何都比英日的要大。就拿目前中國的情形來說，日本獨覇東亞的野心雖已完全敗露，但其現刻的行動主要地還在華北，而英國在華的勢力範圍却是華南和長江流域，所以，在現實性上英日的衝突</p>
<p>比較地還不很直接；同時，在另一方面，美國在華南，在長江流域的勢力，却在猛烈的擴張，成爲了與英國在華的直接衝突者。因此，英國不僅不聯美制日，而且，在某種情形下，甚至還要拉住日本以對付美國。（九一八）以後倫敦所表現的袒日態度，最近英外相西門之公然承認日本在華的（特殊權利），便是大不列顚帝國態度之顯明表示。</p>
<p>至於美國，則它現正與英國實行關稅戰貨幣戰，以爭奪世界巿塲，當然亦</p>
<p>說不上與倫敦交歡來對付日本。所以，日本近來對中國的侵略行動，雖然威脅到了美國的利益，但在紐約方面，除一再背誦九國公約外，只有（忍氣吞聲）而已；並沒有切實聯絡英國以制日本的打算。</p>
<p>由此看來，英美一致對日的事，至少在目前形勢下是不可能的。</p>
<p>英美之不能一致對日，當然是日本積極進攻中國之良機。英國工黨機關報DarlyHerald對此曾作了這樣的評論：</p>
<p>「日本政府常能利用糾紛的形勢，迅速在遠東抓住機會。日本最近的活躍，便是因爲其他國家過於忙碌或不願多事。···日本最近的要求，實爲夷中國爲日本保護國的一大飛躍。這是公然攻，擊中國的政治獨立，而中國政治獨立固不僅九國公約曾加保障，且其他國聯國家也誓同保持。但是有什麼用呢？法國的固執國際聯盟是用以對付德國，而西門外相則依然以爲對華侵略乃日本之歷史使命。········」</p>
<p>列强，特别是英美的衝突愈厲害，便愈是有利於日本對華之侵略。最近日本之壓迫我們承認二十一條，承認西原借欵，解决過去日本侵略中國的一切懸案，實行與「滿洲國」通車通郵，便是其在列强正有事於歐洲，英美衝突發展的形勢下，希圖很快地併吞中國，獨覇東亞的表現。</p>
<p>這樣，如果要想英美一致對日，以獲得中國的獨立，那恐怕這一想望還不實現，中國已經亡了！</p>
<p>而且，老實說，卽令英美眞能結合起來，將日本驅逐於中國之外，甚至掃平東京，臣服島國，||卽令這樣，如果我們自已還是這樣地不行，那恐怕也不能免掉作亡國奴的命運吧。</p>
<p>自然，在外交上我們是可以利用帝國主義間的衝突來求自已的獨立與解放的，但主要地還是要我們自已爭氣才行；如果老是這樣睡着不動，那就是帝國主義的衝突再尖銳，就是英日美在太平洋上天天打戰，也是沒有辦法的；更何况英日美等帝國主義的衝突就是爲的爭奪我們的利益呢？</p>
<p>名人傳記</p>
<h3>一位科學戰綫上的婦女史泰恩女士</h3>
<p>— 汶原</p>
<p>國際間著名生理學者及前日內瓦大學生理化學部主任史泰恩女士，現在是俄國莫斯科生理科學研究所的指導者。這個科學研究所，爲的是要造就一支科學研究所的女主任及指導員生力軍。史泰恩的科學工人（卽科學研究者）和畢了業的學生，一大半都是婦女。史泰恩感覺到婦女在科學領域中比不上其他領域中來得踴躍，因此她决意要帮助一般的婦女參加到科學戰綫上來。</p>
<p>史泰恩女士具有活潑的堅强的個性。在她的辦公室裏處理一切學術上的及組織上的問題，都是很精確的。從她的容儀上可以看出她是有着三十一年的學術上及敎授上工作的經騐，但她在外表上還是年靑的，生氣勃勃的。</p>
<p>史泰恩女士把她研究所的工作，定在一個廣泛的標凖上，這樣糾正了一切戰鬥的婦女都是天生狹隘（卽無能）的不正確的傳統觀念。因爲她是九個國際學術團體和會員，她常常收容外國科學者，在她的指導下從事於科學上的探求。現在在研究所中有四個外國有在工作着。</p>
<p>在一九二九年，她出席於波士頓的一個科學會議，並順便在美國住了二個月。她覺得在美國人和俄國人之間，有些是相同的地方。因爲這兩個國家都是世界上最大的國家。她曾經以書面報告於在羅馬，波士頓，米蘭地方舉行的國際生理學會議。在法國，德國，荷蘭，瑞士及比利士，曾宣讀過許多論文。她的關於氧化及關於血流與腦間生理上的障礙的研究，曾獲得了國際間的讚譽。她在外國及俄國的雜誌上，已發表過二百多篇的科學工作。</p>
<p>生理學科學研究所現正在進行睡眠的天然性及神經中樞好睡的結果的實騐。另一組在研究生物吸烟的結果。史泰恩女士對於這些敎育的及實際的問題很是熟練，因爲這是她在三十一年前就開始學習的。她雖誕生在俄國，但她却拋棄了家庭而去日內瓦大學研究醫學。她的科學事業上的天才，在她還是學生的時代就發現了。她是婦女中第一個走進日內瓦著名生理學者蒲立瓦斯脫林敎授的實騐室，她在一九零二年完成了研究內分泌的學業，翌年就得到博士學位。在一九零四年，她担任了日内瓦大學生理學院的助敎。因爲她的博士論文的優越，還得到了獎狀。</p>
<p>她的學術是不斷在進步着，每隔幾年就可看到她不僅在生理學領域中有着新的貢獻，而且還獲得了一直到當時婦女還沒有佔過的新的位置。在一九零六年，她在生理化學方面作了次專門的講演，在一九一七年，特別爲她設立了一個生理化學的特別講座。</p>
<p>當她在日內瓦的時候，雖然與僑居國外的革命團體有密切的關係，但她沒有加入任何的革命政黨。一直到十月革命的到來和社會主義建設的獲得基本勝利，她才感到她的事業應該在科學與社會主義建設溶合的，和研究的機會與觀察都建築在新社會觀的蘇聯去開展的。</p>
<p>在一九二五年，一張聘書從莫斯科大學第二院送來，她就辭去了在日內瓦的職務而就任莫斯科大學第二院的生理學敎授。到一九二九年，全俄人民委員會特別下令設立生理學研究所，並任她爲該所的指導員。</p>

<h3>廣州通訊　盲女鬻歌</h3>
<p>— 振羽</p>
<p>廣州，這被稱爲「西南文化總滙之區」的都巿，它給與我一點什麼的印象呢？除了那醜惡的用我們的脂膏所建成的衙門，大商店，和闊佬的住宅等令人看了不寒而慄感到很大的威脅外，相反的，還有這地方所特有的鬻曲的盲女的苦臉，深深的印在我的腦幕之中。</p>
<p>盲女鬻歌，別的地方也是有的，不過，總沒有廣州的旣多而又特別。無論春，夏，秋，冬，無論早晨，晚上，祇要是稍有人跡的馬路上！最多的是長堤一帶：茘枝灣頭，鬼棚尾處，都可以看到她們的踪跡。她們戴着墨晶眼鏡，穿着流行的時裝，負着樂器，跟隨着帶路的老媽子，三三兩兩地，或者躑躅街頭，或者呆立路邊，斷斷續續地哼出凄凉的歌聲。祇要你有一毛錢，也都可以隨召隨到；而且除唱曲之外，你要在她的肉體上找一點性的激刺，也都不遭拒絕的。這便是廣州的盲女的特色，也就是別的「天堂」裏所沒有的一層「地獄」</p>
<p>你初到廣州，你一定驚奇這裏盲女之多竟如過江之　，成羣結隊地滿佈於馬路。據我調查：她們不一定是產於廣州，大多出於廣東各鄕的鄕間，都是貧家女兒。她們的父母當然沒有錢供給她們醫治囉！而她們祇會銷耗，不會生產，遺嫁旣沒有人肯娶，留在家裏又非一貧如洗的父母所能担負她一生的供養，又加之窮鄕僻壤，思想落後，封建的遺毒甚深，本來已是重男輕女；不幸她們又患着殘疾，就愈被厭惡了。</p>
<p>在五六年前，有一些「三姑六婆」之類，敎她們習得幾隻俚曲，牽出來給人們消遣，藉博蠅頭微利。她們價旣低廉，又可以作肉慾的供給，就被下層社會所歡迎；漸漸地愈聚愈多，變成一種畸形的職業。</p>
<p>然而，最近，她們連這最後的一綫生機也都無法保持！數量是從一千餘人减到四，五百人。這因爲時至今日，從各方面的侵略，榨取，摧殘，破壞了無數人的職業；卽有業者也被重重的削剝，生活日艱，連這最低廉的娛樂也都無法享受了。</p>
<p>我曾和她們「交易」過一回。那一個盲女，年紀在概有二十二，三歲。我點了一隻呌做「瀟湘琴怨」的粵曲，於是她拿下琴，調好絃，拉着嗓子！</p>
<p>「恨東風|不爲儂|吹愁去！······」</p>
<p>以下接第五版</p>

<p>她的歌喉婉轉，悠揚，陰沉，悲哀，眞所謂如怨，如慕，如泣，如訴，把詞句中的寄託一一表現出來。一切藝術都是表示其感情，生命的，生活的經騐就是其靈魂。她這首哀歌，是溶解了她悲苦的命運，有如杜窩沙克的新世界交響曲裏黑奴的凄愴的歌聲。　　她唱完了，我給她四毛錢。她像很感激，笑着向我道謝。完了她還不走，這大概是我多給了兩毛錢，她在等待着我去多享受一點權利吧！而我卻感到一陣心酸，也隨意地和她交談。她告訴我她悲慘的履歷，如前所述。又談到她的生活情形，她說！</p>

<h3>空救國飛行船發明的故事（二）</h3>
<p>— 叔麟</p>
<p>世界最初作氣球的，究竟是那一國，言人人殊，有的說是中國，在千六百九十四年到中國來的一位法國宣敎師，他的書中記着中國某一朝的皇帝登基時，人民爲表示慶祝，在空中放大氣球，這是非常有趣的話，但可惜那個氣球是那一種形式，氣球中放些什麼氣體，都沒有記到。</p>
<p>在歐州最初製作氣球的是派托姆羅倫軋司麥。軋司麥生於一六八九年在巴西的賽脫斯地方。一七零八年回到自已的故鄕卜脫高來，開始製作氣球。當時也沒有詳細的記錄，不知確實情形。軋司麥以自已所製的氣球，在里斯本的廣塲舉放。</p>
<p>廣塲附近聚集了許多人來看這珍奇的事情，卜脫高的王和妃也出現在這羣人中間。人人以驚奇的眼光看着軋司麥的氣球上昇。那個氣球究竟昇到多少高，氣球多少大，也沒有記述下來。祇有一件事是明明白白的，就是軋司麥放了那個氣球後，便被國王申叱，而驅逐出境。</p>
<p>偉大的發明會被申叱，在今日看來是覺得非常滑稽的，但在當時，一般的智識未進步，軋司麥的發明大概被當作是什麼魔術吧。</p>
<p>地蠱惑人心的罪惡下，軋司麥被放逐，發明也就此中止。</p>
<p>從此推測，軋司麥的氣球能這樣引起人的注意，無疑的是大形而很有浮揚力的一個。（未完）</p>

<h3>美國|和|蘇聯的竸賽</h3>
<p>— 乃夫</p>
<p>（一··················（一）</p>
<p>當蘇聯着手五年計劃的時候，世界各國的經濟學者們，簡直沒有把它當一個問題放在眼睛裏。這問題的引起世界的注意，是五年計劃實施第三年以後的事；因爲到那時，已不由得人家不注意它了。　　五年計劃的口號中有這樣的一句：「迎頭趕上去！」就是說，五年計劃要把舊俄的農業國變成新俄的大規模工業國，在技術和生產力的水準上，不特要趕上世界的先進國，而且要後來居上。至於這先進國的目標，首先就是美國，其他各國是沒有一個够得上資格的。因爲蘇聯領土的廣大，自然資源的豐富，除美國外，實在沒有另一個可和她比類的國家。世界各國的經濟學家們，直到近五年來，才把這事情看作一個重大的問題。</p>
<p>（二）············（二）</p>
<p>美國自一九三二年的恐慌以至去年春間的大恐慌之間，貨物的生產額已减低到了極度。而蘇聯却恰好在這時完成了第一次五年計劃，進而開始第二次五年計劃，用急速度發展着她的生產力。</p>
<p>自一九三二年以來，美國一般工業和鐵路的財政狀况，已然是極度的惡化，生產手段的需要因而激减。就是堪稱世界第一的美國製鐵工業也逃不了恐慌的襲擊。據美國鋼鐵聯盟年報稱：「一九三二年的鋼鐵供給額，爲一九O一年鋼鐵聯盟創立以來之最低額。」</p>
<p>在蘇聯，雖在馬格尼哥撒克，烏拉爾，姑茲內等地方新建了許多大規模的製鐵廠，用飛躍的急速增加鐵的生產，尙不能滿足工業的需求之際，美國的實際鐵生產額却被制限於生產力的百分之二五以下，年生產額差不多回到工業發達史上三十年以前的低位。據美國鋼鐵聯盟的報告，最近生產能力和實生產額的比較，有如次表：</p>
<p>美國鋼鐵聯盟的事業成績</p>
<p>|生產能力與實生產額的比較|</p>
<p>一九三三年一月　　　　　　　實生產額</p>
<p>生產能力　　　　　　　　一九三一年　一九三二年</p>
<p>鐵鐵　二二·一　　　　　　　　　七·○　　　三·一</p>
<p>鋼鐵　二七·三　　　　　　　　一○·一　　四·九</p>
<p>展鐵　一九·三　　　　　　　　　七·一　　　三·六</p>
<p>在蘇聯則剛剛相反，她在五年計劃的全期間都感到鐵生產力的不足·而成爲問題的焦點：就是到如今，那怕怎樣增產，仍還是不足。因爲生產手段的生產愈急切。鐵便愈需要過多而供給不足。這完全表示了工業勃興的蘇聯與工業碰了壁的美國的特徵。假如拿第一次五年計劃和第二次五年計劃中蘇聯製鐵工業的實績和發展預想來看看，這種特徵將更加明瞭。（單位百萬噸）</p>
<p>第一次五　　　　增產　　　　第二次五　　增產</p>
<p>年計劃期　　　　　率　　　　年計劃期　　率</p>
<p>一九二七|二八年　0/0　　　一九三七年　0/0</p>
<p>銑鐵　三、○二八　六○二　一八九　　一六、○　　二六○</p>
<p>鋼鐵　四、○一七　五○八　一四○　　一七、○　　二八九</p>
<p>展鐵　三、○三一　四○二　一二五、五　一三、○　三○一、二</p>
<p>鐵管　○、一七　　○、三　一八○、七||</p>
<p>觀上表，　我們不難預料到，將來第二次五年計劃終了時，蘇聯的鐵產額便要趕上美國的生產能力了。因爲根據客觀的事實，在最近的將來，美是否有必須動員她今日所具的生產能力的百分之百去滿足鐵的需求的時代到來，還是一個疑問，而蘇聯的鐵生產額之會依照計劃增加起來，却不能不說是沒有爭論的餘地的。所以，像一九三二年那樣的恐慌年頭姑置別論，卽美國平常的鐵生產額，也馬上就要給蘇聯製鐵工業趕上了。</p>
<p>（三）···············（三）</p>
<p>一方面上昇，一方面却下降，迎頭趕上去的口號是比預定更快地實現了。就拿農塲中的拖曳器講，蘇聯的架數雖然尙不及美國那樣的多，但在美國拖曳器已經過剩　蘇聯則尙覺不足。在美國，新的生產已經中止，破損减少之後便不再補充，蘇聯則國內沒有一個失業者，新的生產正在着着進行，拖曳器工塲的生產力且日益提高。美國個人農塲的拖曳器每年平均只有六百小時的活動，蘇聯集體農塲和國營農塲的拖曳器，則夜以繼日，每年有二千五百小時乃至三千小時的活動。這就是說，蘇聯在這點是遠趕到美國的前面去了。卽就一單位農塲面積的廣袤以及農塲規模的巨大說，美國都不是蘇聯的敵手。</p>
<p>再說美國和日本間，還有移民問題這歷史的問題存在着。自大恐慌和銀行破產的波浪排山倒海的襲了來之後，美國現今便擁有一千五六百萬的失業軍。她不僅要拒絕外國的移民，抑且非向外國實行移民不可了。日本帝國主義向來所唱的人口過剩的問題，現在是成了美國的問題。</p>
<p>（四）···········（四）</p>
<p>蘇聯最初設計五年計劃時，國家計劃委員會的專門家委員會曾預言：蘇維埃的經濟發展，能够用比美國經濟上昇期的最旺盛時代更急的速度完成起來。理由是：在天然資源的豐富和土地的廣大上，蘇聯雖不勝過美國，亦决不弱於她。無論煤，鐵，石油，木材及其他工業資源，或可能的農產，家畜，魚類，果實及其他消費資源，都不稍遜於美國。然而蘇聯却具有兩個顯著的優越性||一則可以立脚於今日國際的關係上，充分應用業已完成的世界最新技術的達成；二則聯邦內擁有一億六千萬的人口，具有莫大的勞動資源，無需如美國發展期那樣要依賴海外的移民的力量的。</p>

<h3>Principal Chiang's Address</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) In his address at the 10th Anniversary Commemoration of the Central Military Academy, Principal Chiang Kai-shek said in brief, "To celebrate the 10th anniversary of our school, I specially wrote an article yesterday, 'A Review of the Revolutionary Course Over the Past Ten Years,' which detailed the school's history. Today, I will briefly report on the school's founding to show the founder's painstaking efforts. At that time, Guangzhou was still surrounded by evil forces. Although the founder was the Grand Marshal, he was determined to establish a military academy to cultivate revolutionary forces. Merely the issue of the school site and buildings required repeated negotiations with other military personnel before they were willing to vacate them. The simplicity of that time was worlds apart from today. At that time, the entire city of Guangzhou was surrounded by counter-revolutionary forces. It can be said that apart from the Huangpu Military Academy, there was almost no revolutionary force. Even the school's daily meals required borrowing money in Guangzhou the night before to buy rice. From this, you can understand the difficult circumstances at that time. Now, the school's environment is so beautiful and life is so comfortable. We should not forget our roots, we should strive for self-improvement, and we should always remember the difficulty and hardship of the founder in establishing the school. Our future endeavors will be more difficult than the past ten years. We must be extra vigilant and work hard, and have the spirit of perseverance, hard work, and adventure from the beginning, in order to shoulder the heavy responsibility of the revolutionary cause. The struggles of the faculty and students in Huangpu for half a year during the three years can always be our model. At the beginning, there were only more than 500 students, and by the time of graduation, only 450 remained due to deaths. Even the weapons were secretly negotiated by the founder with the director of the arsenal, who provided 450 rifles. The entire faculty and students used these 400-odd rifles to fight against all counter-revolutionaries. Although the imperialists used warships to threaten our revolution in Huangpu, we still used these few rifles to resist violence. We must know that the founder only used 400-odd rifles to resist all counter-revolutionary forces when he founded Huangpu. What force did he rely on? He relied on the fearless revolutionary spirit, countless sacrifices, and efforts to achieve today's success. Today's faculty and students number more than 20,000, ten times more than before. The environment is still the same as it was in Guangzhou ten years ago. With so many guns, can we still not remove all obstacles to the revolution? Since we are disciples of the founder, we must embrace the spirit of that time, strive forward, complete the foundation of our second phase of the revolution, and carry forward the revolutionary cause left to us by the founder, to comfort the spirits of the founder, Mr. Liao, and all the martyrs in heaven." (Central News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Jade Tower Presented to Principal Chiang by the Military Academy</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) When the officers and students of the Military Academy presented the memorial tower to Principal Chiang, they also presented a certificate with the following original text: "Revolutionary force, founded in Huangpu, ten years of teaching, securely guarding the Central Plains, continuing the founder's ambition, completing the revolutionary achievement, officers and students are all under your care, bathed in your teachings, on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the establishment of this school, we respectfully made a jade tower, and offer it before your command, briefly expressing our sincerity, and conveying our praise of success, respectfully presented to Principal Chiang Kai-shek." Chairman Huang Jie also delivered a speech, saying in brief, "When the founder passed away in the thirteenth year [of the Republic, i.e., 1924], we were fighting Chen Jiongming in Mianhu, trapped and fighting desperately. Principal Chiang first received the news of the founder's death, but still encouraged us to bravely kill the enemy, personally went to the front line to command, and ultimately achieved a great victory with fewer troops. Our achievements today are all due to the hard work and difficult guidance of the principal over the past ten years. Today, we present this memorial tower to express our condolences, but to comfort the principal, we must still work together with one heart and one mind, under the leadership of the principal, and strive to complete the revolutionary cause left by the founder." Chiang's address said in brief, "I am very ashamed to receive this memorial tower. The achievements of this school today are all due to the encouragement of the students with the four characters of 'fraternity, sincerity, and earnestness.' Now that the foundation of the first phase of the revolution has been established, the second phase of the revolutionary cause still requires effort. During this period, we should add the principles of propriety, justice, integrity, and shame to the fraternity, sincerity, and earnestness as the foundation of the revolution." Finally, Chiang led all the officers and students in paying respects to Wang Jingwei, Dai Chuanxian, and Shao Yuanchong, as the three gentlemen were all former instructors.

<h3>Sports Meet and Public Banquet</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) From 3:00 to 4:00 PM on the 16th, the Military Academy held an exhibition, publicly displaying the achievements of all officers and students and educational equipment. Many people visited. At 4:10 PM, the sports meet began. Zhu Peide, Tang Shengzhi and his wife, and thousands of officers and students attended.

At the same time, the school held a recreational gathering in the auditorium, inviting representatives from graduates from various regions and all officers and students to attend, with performances of Peking opera, Xinjiang song and dance films, magic, fireworks, etc. (Central News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Chiang Dines with Central Committee Members</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Chiang spent the morning of the 16th from 7:00 to 11:00 AM at the Military Academy attending various commemorative events, giving one report and two speeches. At noon, he dined with school committee member Wang Jingwei and representatives of all officers and students in the Military Academy's Industrial Hall.

<h3>Decoration of the Commemoration Venue</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The decoration of the venue for the 10th Anniversary Commemoration of the Military Academy was extremely spectacular. A pine needle archway, symbolizing a triumphal arch, was erected at the south entrance of Huangpu Road, with a couplet inscribed "Horseshoe Tramples to Pacify the Central Plains" "Talking about Military Affairs Reminds One of Huangpu." Small party and national flags, school flags, and wooden shields with the inscription "Fraternity, Sincerity, and Earnestness" were planted along both sides of the road. The couplet on the archway at the main entrance of the school headquarters was "Looking Back on Ten Years of Events" "Caring for Five Hundred States." The ceremonial platform was built in the open space in front of the school auditorium, with the founder's bronze statue in the center. Screens and scrolls presented by important figures, faculty, graduates, and various souvenirs were displayed in a dazzling array. The memorial tower presented to Principal Chiang by all officers and students was carved from green sky stone. The top of the tower was spherical, with the four characters "Fraternity, Sincerity, and Earnestness" engraved on it. It was about three feet high and divided into ten layers, each layer engraved with the names of hundreds of representatives of faculty and staff led by He Yingqin and representatives of students led by Hu Zongnan. The calligraphy was exquisite and the carving meticulous. (Central News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Aviation School dispatched nine aircraft led by Gao Zhihang, arriving in Nanjing on the 15th. At the troop review at 7:00 AM on the 16th, they performed various formations and solo displays in the sky above the Military Academy. Their skill was superb and astonishing. Participants in the review were: (1) faculty and staff, (2) higher education class, (3) officer preparatory class and above, unarmed, (4) officer training class, (5) 10th-term recruit regiment, all fully armed.

<h3>Observations on the Draft Budget for National Revenue and Expenditure of the Republic of China for the 23rd Year</h3>
<p>— Jing</p>
<p>A week ago, it was reported that the draft budget for national revenue and expenditure for the fiscal year of the Republic of China's 23rd year, compiled by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics of the National Government, estimated total revenue at 815,915,000 yuan and total expenditure at 918,685,457 yuan, resulting in a deficit of approximately 102,770,457 yuan. According to a Central News Agency dispatch on the 15th, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics has completed the compilation of the national general budget for the 23rd year and submitted it to the Central Political Council for review. Examining its contents, the important items on the revenue side, such as customs duties, salt taxes, and consolidated taxes, have increased significantly compared to the previous year. However, on the expenditure side, debt service has not seen a corresponding reduction. For the convenience of research, the important revenue and expenditure items proposed for this year are compared with the estimated amounts for the 22nd year in the following table. (Unit: Million Yuan)</p>
<p>Item                   22nd Year                             23rd Year</p>
<p>Customs Duties                                                                         354 Yuan                                                                                   360 Yuan</p>
<p>Salt Tax                                                                         146 Yuan                                                                                   190 Yuan</p>
<p>Consolidated Tax                                                                         97 Yuan                                                                                   110 Yuan</p>
<p>Stamp, Tobacco, and Alcohol Tax                                                                                                  36 Yuan                                                                                   35 Yuan</p>
<p>Debt Service                                                                         241 Yuan                                                                                   250 Yuan</p>
<p>Although the national revenue and expenditure general budget compiled by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics is still subject to the final decision of the Central Political Council, it has undoubtedly undergone a thorough review and is thus worthy of our observation regarding the current state of central finance. Several points are worthy of our deep attention: (1) The biggest difficulty in central finance at present is that regular income is insufficient to cover regular expenditure, which is why it is impossible to avoid issuing 200 to 300 million yuan in public bonds every year. Looking back from the 16th year to the 21st year, public bonds were issued to the tune of approximately 1.1 billion yuan. Even in the 22nd year, as much as 260 million yuan was borrowed. This is all due to the past financial authorities' overemphasis on public bond policy. The general budget of the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics clearly implies a shift towards a tax increase policy. For example, the estimated increase in salt tax revenue is 50 million yuan, the estimated increase in consolidated tax revenue is 20 million yuan, and the estimated increase in customs revenue is 6 million yuan, all of which are clearly evident. This cannot be said to be a major change in financial policy. (2) At a time when the central government's regular revenue is severely insufficient, the only rational remedy lies in reducing expenditures, with increasing revenue being secondary. According to the current situation, it is difficult to say that the regular expenditure for the 23rd year will be greatly reduced compared to the previous year. The military needs for bandit suppression in various provinces and the armaments of the army, navy, and air force are unlikely to be reduced, and debt service expenditures have clearly increased by more than 10 million yuan compared to the previous year. If the tax increase policy is implemented too quickly, it will inevitably lead to smuggling and leakage, and the result may not be sufficient to bridge the gap between regular revenue and expenditure. If one does not earnestly study cost-cutting measures, it will not help the future of national finance. The total expenditure budget of the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics does not seem to fully reflect this truth. (3) In past years, financial expenditures used for productive construction have been far less than those used for other matters. Examining the budget for the 23rd year, the burden of military expenditure and debt still accounts for 80% of total expenditure, which shows that it is not easy to reorganize national finances for the time being.</p>
<p>Finally, from the perspective of the national economy, the result of the tax increase policy will undoubtedly harm domestic industry and commerce, and the expansion of non-productive government expenditures will also indirectly affect industry and commerce. Therefore, is it not difficult to compile the general budget for the 23rd year and seek to "make the present better than the past?"</p>
<h3>Su Yuqi Ordered to Go to Changli to Negotiate with Japanese Garrison; Persuades Japanese Captain to Sanction Subordinates; Japanese Vice-Consul in Tianjin Goes to Changli to Investigate; The Cause of the Siege of the County Government Was Protection of Soil Trafficking</h3>

In addition to the garrison, the Japanese agency stationed in Changli also includes the Captain of the Military Police, Takimoto, and the Chief of the Police Branch Office, Abe, who are all accomplices in protecting opium dens and gambling houses. The incident occurred because Li was protected by the above-mentioned Japanese agencies and trafficked drugs. County Magistrate Liang arrested him and brought him to justice.

After repeated negotiations, the Japanese side allowed twenty men to carry pistols as the County Government guard team. The one hundred and eighty police officers of the County Public Security Bureau have no weapons, so they are as good as nothing. Banditry is rampant in the county, and there is no way to suppress it.

<h3>Suma Talks About the Recent Situation of Sino-Japanese Negotiations; Arita Will Not Enter Beijing in the Short Term; Negotiations to Revise the Commercial Treaty Have Stalled</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Japanese Consul Suma told a reporter from a certain newspaper that he was deeply grateful to the Chinese military and police for their efforts in locating and apprehending Kuramoto and hoped that the Chinese news media could convey this sentiment to the Chinese people. Regarding rumors that Minister Arita would come to Beijing soon, the Consulate has not received formal notification and expects that there is no intention to come to Beijing in the short term. The matter of Sino-Japanese wireless telegram reporting was proposed four years ago, but it failed to materialize due to changes in relations between the two sides. This time, thanks to the Chinese government's goodwill attitude, the telegram was implemented. It is expected that Sino-Japanese relations will improve in the future. Since the revision of the Sino-Japanese commercial treaty, the Japanese side has been very hopeful that the Chinese government would quickly revise the tariff rates, but there is no indication or possibility of negotiations at this time. In addition, the Japanese side hopes that Sino-Japanese air communications can be realized as soon as possible for the development of Sino-Japanese commerce, but there has been no concrete discussion with the Chinese government at this time.

<p>(1) A compromise of a general nature, including frequent personal meetings and official correspondence between the authorities of the two countries.</p>
<p>(2) Recognition of Austrian independence, but neither side makes any guarantees. Germany agrees not to support terrorist activities.</p>
<p>(3) Germany expresses its willingness to return to the League of Nations, but must be recognized as having full rights to military equality.</p>
<p>(4) Agreement on revitalizing trade among the Danube countries, with concurring opinions. The compromise under the second item is a concession by Germany on the issue of its will, in exchange for the current situation regarding the League of Nations and disarmament. (15th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Mussolini Addresses 60,000 People</h3>

His speech was transmitted through loudspeakers, and the listeners cheered continuously. He said, "Hitler and I met not to redraw the map of Europe, nor to increase the turmoil in this weary world. Our meeting is only to find a way to eliminate the gloom in European life, avoid catastrophe, and seek the lowest level of political unity, without which the future of Europe will inevitably decline." (15th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Italian Vice Foreign Minister Issues Statement, Complete Understanding Reached on Political Issues Between the Two Countries</h3>
<p>Venice: Italian Vice Foreign Minister Suvich stated today that the above compromise indicates the psychology of the two heads of state. Germany will eventually abandon its plan to annex Austria. The two sides did not intend to reach any specific agreement on any point. The greatest significance of this meeting is a feeling that an understanding can be reached. (15th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Venice: Italian Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs Suvich told the press today about the outlines of the resolutions obtained by German Chancellor Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini at the meeting on important European issues, stating that the two politicians unanimously advocated joint cooperation on international issues related to Germany and Italy. Italy expressed its agreement with Germany's claim to equal rights in the League of Nations, but was unwilling to first propose asking Germany to rejoin the League. Regarding the issue of Austrian independence, the opinions of Italy and Germany were slightly different in the past, but it was also discussed in detail this time. Hitler and Mussolini both believed that Austria should maintain its independence and that a general, rather than regional, agreement should be drafted to maintain peace within Austria. The two politicians also discussed the issue of disarmament, but the details were not disclosed. Suvich received the press after Mussolini reviewed the vanguards of the Fascist Party and the Youth League. After the review, Mussolini addressed 90,000 people in the square.

<h3>German Prime Minister Flies Back to Berlin, Mussolini Personally Sees Him Off</h3>
<p>Venice: German Chancellor Hitler flew back to Germany at 8:10 this morning. He departed from his residence at 7:10, passed through St. Mark's Square, stopped for 20 minutes to visit, and then went to the airport. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini was already at the airport to greet him. Hitler saluted Mussolini with the Fascist salute, and the two shook hands.

<h3>Italian Prime Minister to Visit Germany in Return</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The Berlin Evening News published a noteworthy dispatch from Venice, saying that Chancellor Hitler had personally invited Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to visit Germany. Mussolini has never left the country since taking office, but it is said that he may make an exception this time and visit Germany in return for Hitler's invitation. (16th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Broad Talks, No Documents Signed</h3>
<p>Mussolini and Hitler first met at the Lido Golf Club for about two hours, then took a small boat for a cruise and continued their talks. According to German sources, the talks were of a general nature, covering a wide range of topics, and no documents were signed. People in Rome said that the compromise was a personal agreement between the two heads of state, and real political issues were secondary. No documents were signed between the two countries, and this has now been confirmed. (15th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Germany's Return to the League of Nations Still Has Problems</h3>
<p>Venice: The results of the talks between the two heads of state may not have an immediate impact, but they have a general influence on political developments, as the views of the two countries are clearer than before. It is reported that there is no immediate issue of Germany rejoining the League of Nations, because the disarmament issue has not yet been effectively resolved. (15th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the meeting between Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and German Chancellor Hitler, no official report has yet been received here. British political circles believe that the exchange of views between the Italian and German authorities has not yet yielded any results. The general public is quite skeptical about whether the meeting between the two giants can be truly successful, especially regarding Germany's return to Geneva. (15th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Opposing the System of Confrontational Blocs</h3>
<p>Venice: According to semi-official sources, the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini was decided several weeks ago, and Hitler's acceptance of the invitation to go to Venice on the 14th was only notified three days before his departure. It seems that in the days before the meeting, Germany still hesitated, or even proposed conditions for the purpose of the talks, that the issues of the talks should have the significance of the entire Europe, and not only be limited to the relations between Germany and Italy. Since Germany's withdrawal from Geneva, France and Germany have no longer had the opportunity to come into contact. Italy is willing to be a mediator between the two countries to help them reconcile. However, Italy also shares the same view with Germany that if the intention is to reconcile Germany and France, it should be based on the significance of Europe. If there are local combinations and group policies, then that is opposed. Regarding the Danube issue, the Italo-Austrian-Hungarian Agreement signed in Rome on March 15 has always been open, closed to Germany but also open to other powers willing to join. The talks in Venice, both sides opposed local group policies. The issue of revising the treaty was not mentioned, but the maintenance of Austrian independence was a real treaty proposed by Italy. (15th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Four-Power Pact Not Mentioned</h3>
<p>Relations between Italy and Germany have become closer because of this talk between the two leaders. Their common policy is to avoid a system of mutual confrontation among countries, and the Four-Power Pact was not mentioned, which is important because the Four-Power Pact is the most critical theory in Italian foreign policy. The underlying purpose of the establishment of the pact was to prevent France and Germany from forming their own blocs for self-defense. It is heard that Germany and Italy still hold the same view and are willing to cooperate with other countries. (15th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Personal Friendship Continues to Be Maintained</h3>
<p>Late tonight, the authorities released a message stating, "The Italian Prime Minister and the German Chancellor continued to discuss general European issues and relations between the two countries today in a spirit of sincere cooperation and brought them to a conclusion, and the personal friendship already established between the two heads of state will continue to endure in the future."

<h3>Italian and German Newspapers Praise in Unison</h3>
<p>Rome: The official newspaper here praised Chancellor Hitler's visit to Italy, saying that the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini would bring peace to all of Europe. The Tribune declared that the foundation for the revival of Europe is not in Geneva, but must be sought in the creation of Prime Minister Mussolini. Hitler and Mussolini have established a deep relationship that will have effects in the future. The Italian Daily reported that the spiritual relationship between the two revolutionary countries, Italy and Germany, is not only striving to restore the principles and welfare of the two countries, but also will restore the relations between all nations. The goal is to create a fairer, freer, and more balanced European situation. Former Secretary-General of the Fascist Party Farinacci declared in his newspaper that the two great nations of Germany and Italy, both building nations, deeply feel the historical responsibility entrusted to them, so they decided to jointly review the international situation. Their supporters are not the parliament, but the people of the two countries. This meeting will produce substantive results that are conducive to European peace, and this result will definitely not be produced by conferences that all countries regard as advocating empty talk and not helping reality. (16th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) German newspapers unanimously expressed satisfaction with the meeting between Chancellor Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini in Stra. A newspaper this morning, representing the official view, stated correctly that the result of the Mussolini-Hitler meeting was a psychological effect. Mussolini and Hitler have now established a relationship with each other. National Socialism and Fascism have now met, and the people of Germany and Italy have also promoted the friendship between the two countries. This is of great significance to the peace of the two countries and Europe. Only from this foundation can new results be produced. The National Socialist Party newspaper stated that Chancellor Hitler's adoption of face-to-face meetings was clearly different from previous diplomatic methods, and repeatedly expressed goodwill to France, but the French government refused. France therefore did not hesitate to vent its anger on the Stra conference and expressed skepticism. German newspapers this morning detailed the speech of Mussolini's son-in-law Ciano, stating that Germany would immediately return to Geneva after equality was realized and that establishing normal relations between Austria and Germany was welcomed by Austria in terms of Austrian independence.

<h3>French Reporters Have Nowhere to Inquire</h3>
<p>(Paris) The French press sent a large number of reporters to Venice, hoping to convey news of the Hitler-Mussolini meeting, but they were disappointed. The news they obtained was only superficial, and very little was revealed about the content of the talks. French reporters had nowhere to inquire, so they resorted to fantasy and speculation, and recognized that this meeting was purely caused by France's absurd foreign policy. (16th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Mussolini Restless, Moves from Ancient Residence to Hotel</h3>
<p>Tonight, Hitler hosted Mussolini at the Grand Hotel. Although the old Ciani residence had been renovated to accommodate the Italian Prime Minister, Mussolini was clearly restless and changed his residence to the luxurious Lido Hotel last night, which everyone thought was strange as if there were ghosts in the Ciani residence. According to legend, Napoleon bought this residence 140 years ago and only stayed one night before declaring that he would never live there. After the two heads of state had dinner at the Grand Hotel, they took separate cars to the Lido Hotel, talking and laughing happily, and watched the nobles dancing. Hitler did not return to the Grand Hotel until 11:40 at night to sleep. (15th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>French Defense Budget Approved by the Chamber of Deputies, Totaling 31 Billion Francs, Used for Border Defense and Expansion of Naval and Air Forces</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Chamber of Deputies has approved the national defense budget, with a total of 31,200,000,000 francs for the army, navy, and air force, allocated as follows: (1) Border defense works: 12,750,000,000 francs, to be spent over two years.

(3) Implementation of the air force weapons and equipment plan, with 9,800,000,000 francs to be spent from the 1934 budget. The entire plan was passed by the Chamber of Deputies with a majority of 420 votes to 171 votes. During the discussion, some people expressed opinions on the issue of military quotas. Prime Minister Doumergue replied earnestly that the government would implement the current military laws in a clear manner, and that matters concerning military quotas and conscription periods would not be changed without the consent of the parliament, and would not act arbitrarily even during the parliamentary recess.

<h3>Naval Preparatory Conference, Japan Attaches Importance to France's Attitude, US Representative Will Go to England from France</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Italy will also participate in the preparatory conference for naval disarmament. The only country remaining is France. The foreign affairs authorities believe that France's participation or non-participation will greatly affect next year's disarmament conference, so they attach great importance to it and observe France's position as follows: (1) According to the Washington Treaty, France is restricted in battleships and aircraft carriers, and is not restricted in auxiliary ships, so France's purpose is to surpass the naval power of Italy and Spain, and therefore may issue a warning that it will not be restricted like England, the United States, and Japan. (2) Recently, France has been quite dissatisfied with England's inclination towards Italy and Germany, and because of next year's disarmament conference, it is afraid that Germany will participate in it, so it will not participate in the preparatory conference this time. (3) France hopes to achieve the goal of disarmament through the League of Nations, because the meeting of the five major naval powers, its own主張, will be oppressed by England and the United States. If it is the League of Nations, France can use small countries to implement its主張. (16th Telecommunication Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Luo Shanpei'er, counselor of the Soviet Embassy in France, returned here from Geneva yesterday. Today, Foreign Minister Barthou received him and discussed the work of the disarmament conference. Barthou also met with Davis, the US representative to the disarmament conference, and Davis will go to England soon to participate in the preliminary talks for the 1935 naval conference.

<h3>Observations of Moscow Newspaper</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Commenting on the commencement of negotiations for the next naval conference, Izvestia said: "Since the conclusion of the Washington and London agreements, the international situation has undergone decisive changes. The development of the Far East in recent years has shown the close political ties between Britain and Japan. Although there are still sharp contradictions between them, this does not erase the isolation of the United States and the hopeless restoration of the "spirit of the Washington Conference." The naval armament problem cannot be viewed in isolation. The negotiations in London must take the political issues of the Pacific as the backbone, just as the negotiations in Geneva are inseparable from the European security problem. The Washington Agreement is an indivisible part of the Nine-Power Treaty on China, but this treaty has been torn to shreds by Japan's well-known aggressive actions in the Asian continent, and the conclusion of a new naval agreement must have its political prerequisites in any form. The current situation is unprecedentedly difficult. In any case, what occupies the central position of the next naval conference will not be military and technical issues, but general political issues, not armament issues but security issues, so the conference cannot be limited to the narrow aspects set by the preliminary negotiations in London."

The street where the Interior Minister was killed will be named "Pieracki Street." The government also decided to hold a week of national mourning, and the funeral will be held next Monday or Tuesday. On that day, all theaters and entertainment venues nationwide will be closed. Many diplomatic representatives and dignitaries from various countries stationed in Warsaw expressed their condolences to the bereaved family. The authorities issued a notice describing the appearance of the fugitive murderers and offered a reward of 100,000 Polish zlotys to ensure their capture. (16th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>German Shock</h3>
<p>Propaganda Minister Goebbels' visit to Poland had good results, and German newspapers were very satisfied. Unexpectedly, shortly after Goebbels left Warsaw, news of the assassination of Polish Interior Minister Pieracki spread. German public opinion was greatly disappointed. The Berliner Börsen-Zeitung stated, "Pieracki was one who openly advocated Polish-German cooperation. This act of violence has shocked the world. Unless the elements of hatred are eliminated, there will never be peace between nations." The newspaper believes that the assassination was carried out by anarchists. Propaganda Minister Goebbels and Foreign Minister Neurath have both sent telegrams of condolence to the Polish government. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Pieracki's Brief Biography</h3>
<p>Before and during the European War, Pieracki made great contributions to Polish independence. In 1929, he served as Vice Minister of the Interior, and the following year he served as Deputy Prime Minister in the Sławek Cabinet. He has held his current position since 1932.</p>
<h3>Following the Wales Conference: German Prime Minister to Visit Danzig for Meeting with Piłsudski, with Goebbels Preparing the Way; Readjustment of German-Polish Relations Deemed Necessary, Assassination of Polish Interior Minister May Be Affected</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The news of the assassination of Polish Interior Minister Pieracki has greatly shocked German political circles. Propaganda Minister Goebbels' visit to Poland was originally hoped to create a good impression on Polish public opinion and those in power, thereby promoting relations between the two countries. Now, with Pieracki's assassination, these expectations may be hampered. Yesterday, after Goebbels met with Polish Minister of Military Affairs Piłsudski, some in German political circles spoke highly of the great political significance of the event. The trend towards closer relations between Germany and Poland is largely due to Goebbels' efforts. Goebbels has long recognized the benefits of National Socialist Germany approaching Poland, and therefore has worked hard to establish contact between the two countries. Recently, Polish journalists visited Germany, and the welcoming ceremonies were extremely grand, all under the auspices of Goebbels. Goebbels received excellent treatment in Poland, as the German newspapers reported. However, the main focus of Goebbels' visit to Poland was to meet with General Piłsudski. If he had returned without meeting Piłsudski, his mission would not have been fully successful. According to some speculations, Goebbels' visit was to make preparations for a meeting between Prime Minister Hitler and Piłsudski. Since Hitler had already met with Mussolini in Italy, a meeting with the Polish authorities, a "new friend," would also be a necessary move in German politics. It is also generally said that the situation may change after Hitler's talks with Mussolini, so a rapid reorganization of German-Polish relations is even more necessary. In the past, Poland, in order to shift the direction of the National Socialist government's outward development, once sought mutual cooperation with Germany and concluded a ten-year non-aggression pact with Germany. Now, the Prime Ministers of Italy and Germany are in Venice discussing the situation, and it is not impossible for a compromise on the Austrian issue to be reached. If a compromise is reached, Poland's diplomatic position may actually return to the situation before the Polish-German non-aggression pact was signed. This is a matter of great concern. The reason why a meeting between Hitler and Piłsudski is so important, and why Goebbels considers this matter his main task, is due to this. After Goebbels arrived in Warsaw, it was said that Piłsudski was ill and unable to receive guests, but suddenly he recovered. This is probably not unrelated to the above-mentioned factors. Some here say that the meeting between Hitler and Piłsudski has already been decided in principle, and there is talk of choosing Danzig as the meeting place. The only thing that has not been decided is the date. Goebbels' mission has just ended, and Polish Interior Minister Pieracki was suddenly assassinated. It is unknown whether the plan for the meeting between the two leaders will be overturned as a result. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Cuban President Attacked with Bomb, Sixteen Injured</h3>
<p>Havana: Cuban President Mendieta was attending a banquet somewhere this evening when a bomb suddenly flew in during his speech, causing great chaos throughout the hall. The President's fingers were injured, and he was frightened and about to fall when he was supported by those around him, who bandaged his wound with a towel. The stenographer sitting behind the President was unfortunately killed by the bomb. Eight other guests were injured. According to Reuters reporters who heard from eyewitnesses at the scene, the President's escape was miraculous. If the stenographer had not shielded him, he would not have escaped unscathed. Therefore, cabinet members and guests congratulated the President. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Havana: Cuban government officials gathered for lunch at the Tiscornia naval base when a bomb exploded, injuring sixteen people. President Mendieta also suffered a hand injury. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>

Furthermore, the cabinet prohibited individuals without licenses from hiding or using various military weapons and established special courts to handle such cases. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<h3>End of Anglo-French Trade War: New Trade Agreement Reached</h3>
<p>(London) The Foreign Office announced today the cessation of the Franco-British trade war, which began in February. The two governments have now signed a draft trade agreement, jointly abolishing all retaliatory measures and making mutual concessions. Most-favored-nation treatment will be applied to tariffs and other matters. The trade war began in January, when the French government promulgated quota restrictions, excluding approximately 75% of imported goods. An additional 134 types of goods were added to the quota. The British side protested, claiming that it discriminated against British commerce and favored the United States and Denmark. Britain also demanded a revision of the quotas, believing that these restrictions directly violated the most-favored-nation treaty signed between Britain and France in 1882. France rejected this request. British businessman Simon moved in the House of Commons to raise tariffs on French imports to the point of prohibition. Therefore, the two countries engaged in a trade war. After encountering this retaliation, the French Foreign Office requested negotiations to cease hostile actions. The British government accepted the request, and today's trade agreement was reached. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) The newly revised Franco-British commercial agreement was signed for the first time at the Foreign Office today, bringing the trade dispute between the two countries to an end. The agreement contains a resolution approving the management of certain agricultural products. The detailed contents will be announced after the agreement is signed. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Twelve Nations Default on War Debts</h3>
<p>(Washington) As of last night, the total amount of war debt received by the United States was only $166,538 from Finland. The total amount of war debts due yesterday from the other twelve countries was $47.8 million. The amount the United States has received is one three-thousandth of the debt due. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Lithuania today notified the U.S. State Department that it would suspend payment of its debt to the United States. Now, all debtor nations except Finland have taken unified action. The U.S. government's previous proposal to Britain to repay the debt with goods has yielded no results. This is the first time that Britain has paid nothing. Finland, because it did not make any demands, has been rewarded by the United States with a friendly trade treaty, which gives Finland larger import quotas and other economic benefits. This treaty was approved by the Senate today. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>
<h3>Germany's Debt Suspension Issue</h3>
<p>(Berlin) After the British government announced that it would establish a German Debt Clearing Office in London, the German government immediately prepared countermeasures. Therefore, today the economic circles are filled with the atmosphere of an Anglo-German trade war. Berlin also officially responded to British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain's declaration, stating that if Britain retaliates against German exports, Germany will impose the same measures on British exports. Germany will not negotiate under the pressure or threat of the Clearing Office. The aforementioned negotiations were proposed by Mr. Chamberlain, who stated that if British bondholders can receive fair treatment, the Clearing Office may not need to be established. The purpose of the Clearing Office is to deduct German debts to Britain under the Dawes and Young Plans from the payment for German products. According to sources in Paris, the French government will also find ways to protect the rights of bondholders. The method to be adopted will likely be to withdraw from German debt payments. The United States has not yet made any official announcement. Some hope that no drastic action will be taken. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The British government has issued a memorandum to Germany stating that because the German Reichsbank has suspended debt payments for six months, it will establish an Anglo-German Clearing House. According to Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, the Clearing House only applies to Britain and not to the entire British Empire. Germany buys more from the British Empire than it sells to it, but it buys less from Britain than it sells to it. The German financial community was disappointed by the news of the establishment of the Anglo-German Clearing House and said that Britain may not implement this system and that Germany's suspension of payments will not be affected by British threats. Germany has now drafted a reply, which has not yet been sent. The gist is that if Britain adopts any plan that is detrimental to German exports, Germany will use retaliatory actions to resist British imports into Germany, and that in 1934, Germany's trade deficit with the British Empire was approximately 70 million marks. The German government cannot negotiate under the threat of establishing a Clearing House. The German government issued an explanatory statement to the countries that issued Young Bonds, stating that Germany had made great sacrifices to pay its debts, but foreign countries were unable to accept German goods, causing Germany to fail to obtain foreign currency to pay its foreign debts. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Washington) German Ambassador to the United States Luther today submitted a note to the U.S. State Department explaining Germany's financial situation and the reasons for suspending debt payments. The note stated that Germany does not discriminate against U.S. bondholders. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The cabinet is scheduled to meet tomorrow to discuss the issue of Germany's deferral of foreign debt principal and interest. The government has now decided that no changes will be allowed to the repayment of the principal and interest of the Dawes and Young bonds. However, France is willing to agree with Germany on a method, rather than take unilateral action. The interest payments on the Dawes and Young bonds due this month have been paid. Before the next interest payment is due on July 15, France and Germany have one month to negotiate calmly. Only if it is still impossible to reach a compromise by that time will France take all necessary actions to ensure that German bond principal and interest are paid in full as usual.

<h3>Thirty-Four Nations Approve Blockade of Bolivian and Paraguayan Arms</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Thirty-four countries have now, in principle, approved the proposal to ban the transportation of arms to Bolivia and Paraguay. The committee in charge of this plan advocates that the major powers should implement this ban so that other places can follow suit. According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington, the U.S. Department of Justice has ordered an investigation into the incident of military supplies worth $200,000 currently stored at the Norfolk wharf in Virginia and intended for shipment to Bolivia, in order to determine whether the sale of the military supplies violates President Roosevelt's ban on the transportation of arms to Bolivia and Paraguay issued on May 28. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Senate Ratifies Three Treaties</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Senate today ratified three foreign treaties. The first is the League of Nations Treaty on the Supervision of Arms Transportation, which was established by the 1925 Geneva Conference. This treaty was recently submitted by the President in a special message, requesting Congress and the League of Nations to take further action, that is, to immediately ban transportation to the warring countries in the Chaco region. This proposal has been passed by Congress. The approval of the Geneva Treaty was subject to a reservation made by Senator King, that is, the territorial rights of Persia over all Persian Gulf territories must be absolutely respected. The other two are the South American Non-Aggression Pact signed on October 10, 1933, and the friendly trade treaty between the United States and Finland. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<h3>Righteous Army Attacks Shulan City, Rescuing Dozens of Prisoners</h3>

The Righteous Army suffered greater losses. The police are now seeking reinforcements from Jilin to prevent the Righteous Army from returning to attack. (Dentsu Telegram, 16th)</p>

<p>Gold and Silver: London Gold Price: The London gold price today is 137 shillings 9 pence, up half a penny. London Silver: The London silver price today is 19 pence 6875 for spot and 19 pence 75 for futures, both lower than yesterday by 125. In the morning, Indian selling was met by speculative buying.

Operators are unwilling to expand their trading.</p>
<p>Bombay Silver: The Bombay silver market was stable today. Spot fell 3 annas to 54 rupees 15 annas. Futures also fell 3 annas.</p>
<p>Special dispatch from Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. quoting a London cable stating that the Financial Times said that the news of the U.S. Congress passing the Silver Purchase Act has attracted considerable attention, but when the clauses of the act were initially announced, the general public expected that it would not have much impact on the world silver market. Now, although the act has been passed, public opinion has not changed. There are recent reports from New York that the United States has purchased 80 million ounces of silver in London, which has surprised people in the London silver market. It is said that the above figure must include silver purchased domestically, because the United States has not purchased such a large amount of silver in London.</p>
<h3>Exchange Rates</h3>

<p>Indian Cotton: The Bombay cotton market initially fell due to speculative selling, and then stabilized due to buying of July-August contracts and selling of April-May contracts by Liverpool and Continental exporters. The price of July-August Broach cotton was 207.5 rupees, up 0.75 rupees.</p>
<p>British Cotton: The price of July contracts in the Liverpool cotton market was 6.44, up 7 pounds sterling from yesterday's close.</p>

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>New York: The securities market opened strong and active today. Various stock prices all rose, by varying amounts. The most significant increase was 2 pounds sterling. Metal securities rose particularly sharply because the steel industry strike has not yet broken out, and Congress is likely to adjourn early.

<p>Xu Residents Oppose the Catholic Church's Purchase of Land to Build a Church</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Mao Lun, a Catholic priest in Xuzhou, previously privately purchased 20 mu of civilian land on Baizi Street in Beiguan, intending to build a church. He has already cut off the highway, inciting public outrage and widespread opposition. At the same time, various circles in the local community believe that the Catholic priests proselytizing in Xuzhou and their followers are all using religion to deceive people, giving the citizens a very negative impression. Therefore, they are strongly opposed to the construction of a second church. Both sides have submitted petitions to the Provincial Construction Department, requesting the provincial government to instruct the local authorities to investigate and handle the matter.

<h3>Military Situation Tense in Northern Fujian as Troops Suppress Bandits</h3>
<p>Fuzhou correspondence: The Red Bandits in northern Fujian have recently infiltrated Yong'an and Shaxian again, causing widespread disturbances. Subsequently, Liu Heding, commander of the 9th Column, and Wang Jinxiu, commander of the Minjiang Garrison, dispatched a brigade from the 56th Division and two regiments of security forces to intercept them. By the 7th, the bandits had suffered heavy casualties and could not withstand the pressure, and the entire force collapsed and retreated. In the past two days, as many as four to five hundred bandit corpses have floated down the Minjiang River from Yanping and Youxi in the upper reaches of the river to the provincial capital, which is indicative of the intensity of the battle. The bandit units within the borders of Shaxian and Yong'an have now also broken up into smaller units, ranging from over a thousand to two or three thousand people in each location, hoping to disperse the National Army's combat forces. Another group of over five thousand people fled from Yong'an to Datian, plundering grain in the northern part of the county. Wei Lihuang, the Eastern Route Front Commander stationed in Yanping, is holding the county seat with his main force, building defensive towers and firing from high positions. Against the Red Bandits scattered in various places, he is joining forces with the local Big Sword Society to encircle and suppress them, aiming to defeat them in the shortest possible time, and has promised to distribute the weapons seized from the Red Bandits to the Big Sword Society for replenishment. According to the report received yesterday, members of the Big Sword Society in Qingzhou, Xiamao, Xiaotao, and Ansha have already begun fierce fighting with the Red Bandits. Commander Wei is supervising the 4th Division of his headquarters and Wang Zhonglian's 89th Division to guard Shunchang and Jiangle, to prevent the Red Bandits from Shaxian and Yong'an from infiltrating and causing disturbances after being defeated. He has also dispatched the two divisions of Sun Yuanliang and Li Mo'an to attack the rear of the Red Bandits in Shaxian and Yong'an. At the same time, he has telegraphed the Provincial Government, requesting that Xian Zongzhou, head of the Mingxi Defense Regiment, and Huang Zuohan, head of the Qingliu Defense Regiment, be appointed concurrently as county magistrates of their respective counties and dispatched to the army to assist in the bandit suppression and to handle local rehabilitation. The Provincial Government has approved the request. News received today is that a portion of the Red Bandits from Shaxian has retreated towards Mingxi, and a portion of the bandits from Yong'an has also retreated towards Qingliu, presumably due to the rear being attacked by the Jianning and Taiyuan forces. The Red Bandits who infiltrated Datian are being encircled and suppressed by troops from Wang Jingyuan's division stationed in Yongtai and Song Xilian's division stationed in Yongchun, and it is expected that a settlement will soon be reached.

<h3>Jiangxi Province: Production and Sales Tax to Be Abolished |To Be Compensated by Business Tax|</h3>
<p>Nanchang correspondence: The authorities in Jiangxi Province, due to the spread of banditry, which almost covered the entire province, needed funds for stretcher bearers, medical care, guides, road construction, and other work to assist the army in suppressing the bandits. Initially, due to the urgency, they had no choice but to introduce the production and sales tax, which was earmarked as a special fund for bandit suppression and reconstruction. A percentage was levied on all goods imported and exported through Jiujiang, amounting to approximately 2.5 million yuan annually, which was criticized by all parties. This was originally out of necessity. Now, the provincial authorities, in accordance with the central government's orders, will abolish all exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies in the counties by the end of April, resulting in an annual reduction of 1.26 million yuan in revenue. The surcharges on the land tax, which originally exceeded four or five times or two or three times in various counties, have now been uniformly reduced to below 70 percent, resulting in an annual reduction of approximately two to three million yuan. Naturally, the production and sales tax cannot be an exception. However, the province, in the midst of the bandit suppression, cannot give up halfway. In order to balance the needs of bandit suppression expenses and allowing the people to rest and recuperate, it has been decided that the first step is to abolish the production tax first and only retain the sales tax, with the production tax being compensated by the business tax. In this way, production can be protected, exports can be encouraged, and imports can be restricted. After the production and sales tax has been effectively implemented, the second step will be to abolish the sales tax in order to remove obstacles to the revitalization of Jiangxi. Before the implementation of the production and sales tax, the Department of Finance repeatedly convened representatives of the province's various commercial sectors to consult and negotiate, resulting in five decisions. The tax is scheduled to be levied on July 1. Currently, the investigation and registration procedures are still at a loss as to what to do, and it is feared that the implementation will be postponed for some time. As for the tax rates: (A) Goods sales industry 0.2% to 1%, bathhouses and barber shops 0.1%, laundry and packing industries 0.4%, contracting and painting industries 0.4%, electrical and dairy industries 0.5%, customs brokerage and construction industries 0.6%, transportation industries (including steamers, rubber-tired vehicles, etc.) 0.7%, photography, flower and tree, and entertainment industries 1%, and manufacturing of scrolls, picture frames, and paintings (including screen pairs) 1%. (B) Manufacturing industries 0.4% to 2% (with a separate table of capital amounts and tax rates for the goods manufacturing industry), printing, publishing, and stationery education supplies industries (including lithography) 0.4%, warehouses 0.5%, processing industries and money shops and banks 1%, and insurance industries 2%.

<h3>Chiang Orders Hubei Province to Implement Compulsory Smoking Cessation | The Campaign Headquarters Approves Ten Measures</h3>
<p>Hankou correspondence: Chairman Chiang, considering the prevalence of opium dens in Hankou and the increasing number of opium addicts, previously ordered the Opium Suppression Supervision Office to close all opium dens in the city. The office has already implemented the order. As for the disposition of opium addicts, in addition to the elderly and infirm, all others are ordered to undergo compulsory detoxification to prevent the spread of the poison. The office has also drafted temporary measures for compulsory detoxification and submitted them to the Nanchang Campaign Headquarters for approval. The measures are as follows: (1) This office will implement the ban and adopt effective detoxification methods. All unlicensed private smokers and other minor opium offenders who are caught will be subject to compulsory detoxification in accordance with these measures. (2) This office will temporarily use the Hankou Municipal Hospital, Mei Shenfu Hospital, and the Hankou Red Cross Branch Hospital as compulsory detoxification centers. When necessary, it may establish its own hospitals or use other hospitals. (3) When this office catches an opium offender, it will issue a document stating the offender's name, age, place of origin, and the reason for the arrest and hand it over to the hospital for examination. After detoxification, the offender will be taken back to this office for release on bail. (4) After the hospital examines the opium offender, it will take three small photographs, one to be kept in the hospital and two to be sent to the office. (5) The expenses for detoxification, medicine, food, and lodging will be paid by this office for the poor and those unable to afford them, based on monthly itemized reports. If the offender has the financial means, the expenses should be borne by the offender, and the office will notify the hospital to collect the fees directly. (6) During the detoxification period, opium offenders are absolutely not allowed to meet with relatives or friends, pass on food, or take other substitute drugs. (7) Opium offenders must obey the physician's diagnosis and treatment and the supervision and guidance of the resident administrator, and must comply with all hospital rules. (8) After the opium offender obtains a medical certificate, he must issue a written pledge not to smoke opium again. If he violates this pledge, he will be severely punished according to the law. (9) These measures are temporary and individual in nature. Matters not covered by these measures will be handled in accordance with the general opium suppression laws and regulations promulgated by the former headquarters. (10) These measures will take effect from the date of approval. (15th)</p>
<h3>Northwestern Inspection Notes: A Special Correspondent's Report</h3>
<p>— Geng Ya</p>
<p>Bao Tou Correspondence from the Xinjiang Inspection Notes: The originally planned route to Ningxia was through the grasslands. After traveling by camel for over twenty days, we finally reached our destination. The journey was through thousands of miles of vast wilderness with very few inhabitants. The fertile land is more abundant than the desert, and the mineral resources are superior to those of other provinces. It is a pity that most of it is still undeveloped virgin land. After staying in Ningxia for a few days, we were unable to find a car, so we took a sedan chair to Lanzhou, traveling and resting at stations along the way. Although it was less arduous than traveling by camel, the desolate landscape of the Ningxia-Gansu border and the lack of postal and telegraph services at the stations were comparable to the grasslands. I would like to describe the above two parts of the journey, specifying the time and space, and record it in diary format, which will be disclosed in sequence. The overview of Ningxia's construction, education, political situation, and customs will be described in a separate article. Although the final destination of this inspection area is Xinjiang, due to the fact that transportation along the way is mostly by camel and horse, the time spent is uneconomical, but the interviews are more convenient. Moreover, since so much time is spent on the journey, it is difficult to stay in Xinjiang for a long time. Therefore, I will call the series "Northwestern Inspection Notes" to indicate that everything seen and heard in the various places in the northwest that I have visited, and that can be published in the newspaper, I am willing to describe in an objective manner.</p>
<h3>Yellow River Water Situation and Grassland Scenery</h3>
<p>April 21st, I stayed in Baotou. A camel driver (referred to as "camel households" by Northerners) came in the morning to transport boxes and goods, saying (they will only reach the riverbank today, preparing to cross the river tomorrow; the riverbank is fifteen *li* from here, and passengers can depart tomorrow). Originally there were four people in my party, but two more joined, so I stayed in the city again to buy more food. At 7 p.m., my friend Mr. Wang Yuru insisted on inviting me to the Si Sheng Tea Garden to watch a play as a farewell dinner. The ticket price for entering the garden was twenty cents, plus a two-cent donation, and a few cents for the seat cushion. The stage facilities were simple. The audience, men and women, sat separately. The gatekeeper shouted loudly, "The imperial order is here!" Immediately, welcoming music was played on stage. Then, more than ten soldiers, holding plaques inscribed with "Long Live the Republic of China," entered and sat down after the lights were dimmed to maintain order. The play ended before we returned. The plays performed were "Chuang Wang Enters Beijing," "Ba Zhou," "Yin Hun Zhen," and "Bao De Zhou," all sung in Qinqiang opera. Many of the actors had teeth blackened like lacquer and were old and weak, like blacklisted commoners. There was one who dressed as a two-headed ghost, hiding a fake head under his buttocks, standing upside down on a chair, wiping his face with his feet as if using a towel, and bowing with rolled-up sleeves (i.e., trouser legs). All of this was very realistic, but extremely vulgar. Many of the female audience members wore red clothes and red hats, and many of the men also wore red undershirts. The actors especially had names like "Seven-Year-Old Red" and "Nine-Year-Old Red." I heard that during the old New Year, many families also posted large red nude paintings with genders reversed in their kitchens. It seems that red is undoubtedly regarded as auspicious here. Men and women were seated separately in the theater. Among the male guests, some directly offered fruit to female guests whom they had never met before. The female guests were helpless, and onlookers sneered. Even lamas came to watch, but many had their hands tied behind their backs, wandered around for a while, and then left. Mr. Wang said, "The women here like to get acquainted with military and political figures (influential people), and their parents tacitly approve and secretly assist them, not for wealth or beauty, but actually to gain power."</p>
<p>I replied, using the example of offering fruit as evidence, that it was probably not the women's liking to get acquainted, but rather that they were forced to do so by external forces involving profit and intimidation. On the 22nd, at 8 a.m., we departed from Baotou. The horse carriage went out of the city, passing the electric light and flour company. The strong wind blew sand, obscuring the sun, and the people in the carriage were all covered in dust. On the grassland, there was wind but no sand, and the sand was quickly blown away. At Wang Dahan Wharf, fifteen *li* away, there were three boats shuttling back and forth. The Baotou Finance Bureau, in order to prevent bandits from sneaking across and to increase financial revenue, specifically set up checkpoints at each ferry crossing to collect fees. Each person was charged ten cents, and each camel, horse, donkey, and ox was charged twenty-five cents. Every month, they collected three to four hundred yuan per crossing. Tolls for carrying goods were not included. The camel team I was with had more than ninety camels. It was late by the time all the camel goods were ferried across the river, so we set up camp and slept on the riverbank. My companions included Mr. Zhu Jiwu, Fan Xinzai, Zhou Xinmin, Luo Ming, and Wang Shilu. We gathered around the stove to cook a meal, using camel dung as fuel, which surprisingly had no odor. The camel driver said, "Camel dung has no odor because when Prince Kangxi campaigned in the west, he used animal dung for warmth, and the emperor decreed that it should be odorless." While talking, they still held and combed their braids, which was annoying. At first, the boiled water we drank was the color of soy sauce, and we suspected it was black tea. But it had no taste and felt slightly sandy to the mouth. Then we realized it was Yellow River water. Although the Yellow River is in the upper reaches, the river surface is not as wide as in the lower reaches, but the current is rapid and the momentum is quite vast. The riverbed is loose sand, which is constantly carried downstream with the rushing water. "The river has no clear day" is due to this reason. If one encounters the so-called "turning over the riverbed" in autumn, the river water is particularly turbid. If you put it in a container, you can get half mud after settling. Fish that are choked to death by the muddy water sometimes float on the surface, but this is only something that is seen in person. The main current has no fixed course, making navigation extremely difficult. According to those experienced in shipping, it is easy to choose the main current when going downstream, and the drift is very fast. When going upstream, one must choose the rapidly flowing current, and the water color should be uniformly turbid to be considered the main current. It is still necessary to tow with ropes and not be able to advance by paddling. If the water flow is slightly slower and there is a trace of clear and turbid water, it is a sign of upstream silting and shallows, and one should not move forward deeply. Therefore, one must observe the ripples and colors of the water surface to judge the passage and obstruction of the current. All boatmen should pay attention to this. The river transport between Baotou and Ningxia usually opens up after Qingming Festival when the river thaws and closes when the river freezes around the time of the Little Snow solar term. The shipping season is always after Qingming Festival until before the Beginning of Winter solar term. Sometimes, near the Beginning of Winter, a northwest wind suddenly rises, and the river water freezes rapidly, causing boats and rafts to be frozen and unable to be transported. Every year from mid-April to mid-November in the Gregorian calendar, it is possible to navigate. After this, it is the freezing period. After the "spring flood," the water level gradually drops, and it rises again in early July. Mid-July to the end of August is the "summer flood," when the water level is at its highest, and the river overflows, with no regulation. The tributaries diverge, making navigation extremely difficult. Pulling the tow rope upstream is especially laborious. The water that breaches the river in September gradually returns to the main current, which is commonly said to be "in August, the river seeks its bed, and the winter river will no longer change," meaning that in August of the lunar calendar, the river finds its original channel. In short, Yellow River boat travel is most difficult during the summer flood. Although the water level is low in spring and autumn, the main current returns to the river channel, and boat travel is easier than during the summer flood.</p>
<p>On the 23rd, at 8 a.m., we departed from Wang Dahan Ferry. The camels walked with their heads held high and strides wide, causing violent shaking. At first, riding made me bend forward and backward, causing my back to ache. Fifteen *li* away at Dashuwan, there was a fort called "Ping'an," with about ten families living there. The Baotou Fourth District Office was located there. The district was divided into eight *xiang*, fourteen *lü*, and seventy *lin*, covering an area of about four hundred square *li*. It originally belonged to the territory of the Dala Tusi under the Ikezhao League of Inner Mongolia. The land price was several tens of yuan per *qing*. The area cultivated was less than one or two tenths of the total. The population of the district was about 12,000, with Mongols accounting for seven-tenths. Those addicted to opium also accounted for seven-tenths. The district established one elementary school with twenty students. When asked what books they were reading, they replied, "Outline and Mirror." Upon inspection, it turned out to be the Three Character Classic written in red ink. In the small shops where food was bought, there were many opium dens. Villagers gathered on a *kang*, either smoking opium or gambling with playing cards. The opium smoke and noise filled the room. Marriages in nearby villages are purely traditional. The bride price for marrying a daughter-in-law is usually two hundred yuan. Jewelry and clothing are brought back to the man's house along with the bride. Whether it is abundant or meager is not considered. On this day, because we were waiting for other camels to travel together, we stayed in Dashuwan. At night, the district security team came to collect tolls for the goods, one yuan per load, half price for empty camels, and thirty cents for a riding passenger. If the fees were not paid in the evening, they would be doubled in the morning.</p>
<p>On the 24th, at 5 a.m., we departed from Dashuwan, traveling southwest for more than thirty *li*. The land was all cultivated and then abandoned, covered with dry white reed grass. Where wildfires had burned, sprouts grew only an inch or so high. There were many rabbits and pheasants hiding in the grass. Suddenly, we heard the sound of a "dang lang" bell, and they fled in a hurry. Ten *li* away at Jianfangtang, we unloaded the camels and let them graze, dug a hole in the ground for a stove, and gathered dung for fuel to cook noodles. There were four or five earthen houses, but we didn't see a single person. There was a small temple with a couplet that read: "Before spring, rain brings early flowers; after autumn, frost delays falling leaves." In reality, it was already spring with no flowers, and not yet autumn with no falling leaves, which is the normal state of the special climate here. Two old women came from more than ten *li* away to sell shoes. One said, "Her old man unfortunately 'suffered from the fox' (i.e., was possessed by a fox spirit), trembling and shaking all over, looking like he was going crazy, demanding rice and noodles that he couldn't eat, and often trying to hang himself. Women in neighboring families have also been possessed by the white dragon on Zhao Jun's tomb, which cannot be cured despite many treatments and has almost led to consumption," and so on. I wanted to see for myself, but the distance was too far. Zhao Jun's tomb is actually the Green Mound in Guihua City, more than twenty *li* away from here. There is a small mountain with jagged green stones, which can be seen by boat. It is said to be Zhao Jun's tomb with her clothing and hat. What the old woman said refers to this, but it is not reliable.</p>
<p>As the golden crow (sun) sank in the west, we continued on our way, riding camels. The ground was covered with white alkali, making it muddy and slippery to walk on. Whenever we encountered ditches or pools of water, the camel drivers would climb over the camel's neck to cross. Before long, the camel's shadow was on the ground, and the bright moon was in the sky. The weather suddenly turned cold, and the water froze into thin ice. The climate of day and night was like two different zones. Thirty *li* away was Tazhao, a lama temple. Unfortunately, we could not see its full view in the moonlight. The sand and grasslands were rugged and uneven. Thirty *li* away was Chaizheng, where we set up camp and rested. We traveled two *cheng* a day, totaling one hundred *li*. The hour hand was pointing to the word "three" (10 pm), and the waning moon was also about to set in the west. The residents were a mix of Han and Mongols. The cultivated land was divided into people's "pai." The so-called "pai" is the Mongolian equivalent of a county or district. Each *pai* has an official called "Jialang," whose authority is as great as a county magistrate. The land under their jurisdiction has not been opened up at all and is still used for animal husbandry. The "min di" (people's land) is inhabited by Han people, who mostly trade with the Mongols. There are very few farmers. The houses of the Mongols are the same as those of the Han people, except that the divine flags are usually erected in front of their doors, which makes them slightly different. I have not yet seen a Mongolian yurt.</p>

<h3>Construction of the Xi'an-Lanzhou Road</h3>
<p>Expected to be largely completed by mid-July. The Engineering Office will move to Lanzhou to work. According to airmail from Lanzhou, the chief engineer of the Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway, Liu Rusong, arrived in Lanzhou on the 7th, accompanied by the engineers of the Dingxi-Lanzhou section, Huang Enguang, and Cheng Benduan. According to Liu, the Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway is the lifeline for the development of the Northwest. Therefore, the National Economic Commission organized the Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway Survey Team in March. I went to Lanzhou with the consultant of the Economic Commission, Ao Ersi, and was responsible for surveying the roadbed. After returning to Xi'an, the Economic Commission urged early completion. All plans have been refined in detail. In terms of organization, the Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway Engineering Office was established, and I was appointed as the chief engineer. The engineering office divided the engineering work into two sections. The first section is the Fenxi-Jingning section, and the engineer in charge of this section is Liu Yijun, which is divided into six subsections. The second section is the Dingxi-Lanzhou section, and the engineer in charge of this section is Huang Enguang, which is divided into three subsections. Each subsection also has a subsection engineer. Each subsection has more than one hundred people engaged in engineering, responsible for about one hundred *hua li*. In addition, a mobile engineering team was also organized. In terms of funding, the National Economic Commission originally planned to allocate 400,000 yuan, but after Song Ziwen came to the west for inspection, another 400,000 yuan was added. In order to ensure the smooth construction of this road, the Engineering Office also organized two survey teams in preparation for construction. One team, led by Captain He, was responsible for surveying the section from Xi'an to Yaodian on the border of Shaanxi and Gansu. The other team, led by Deputy Captain Lin, was responsible for surveying the section from Yaodian to Longde. Both sections have now been surveyed. As for the construction situation of the Yaodian to Longde section, the roadbed is the responsibility of the troops of Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. Yang Hucheng of Shaanxi has approved the allocation of 6,000 troops. There are already 3,000 people who are adding equipment and will start work soon. Chairman Zhu of Gansu Province ordered the New First Army to take charge. The army designated the Shi Yingxiu Brigade stationed in Jingning to take charge. They have been working for several days now, and Brigade Commander Shi is extremely enthusiastic, not only urging the soldiers to work diligently, but also going out to guide them all day long, which is commendable. Bridges and culverts are also being constructed by workers under the guidance of engineers from each section. In total, the entire road project is expected to be largely completed around July 15. At that time, cars will be able to pass smoothly without obstruction. The most difficult parts of the entire road project are Liupan Mountain and the area around Hongtuyao east of Dingxi. The reconstruction of the road on Liupan Mountain is being planned. The route through Hongtuyao was originally planned to follow the river with eighteen crossings, but it has been decided to go over Huajialing. Now Engineer Huang has come to Lanzhou to purchase wood and transport it to that area for use in order to open the road in the shortest possible time. As for the Engineering Office, it has been decided to move from Shaanxi to Lanzhou and has chosen No. 61 Nanfu Street as the address. Mr. Liu has already left Lanzhou and returned to Shaanxi yesterday (the 12th) after finishing his business (the 13th).</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Stagnant Sales of Zhejiang Tea: Cultivation and Manufacturing Follow Old Methods; Overseas Sales are Severely Hit; Japan Seizes the Northeast Market; Tea Industry Loses More Than 6 Million</h3>
<p>According to correspondence from Hangzhou, tea production in Zhejiang Province is a major industry, reaching more than 400,000 *dan* annually. It ranks third in the country after Hunan and Hubei provinces. However, due to a lack of improvement in manufacturing methods, it has been squeezed out by tea from Japan and India, and overseas sales have been severely hit. Business is declining day by day. The authorities are preparing to start improving the situation. Yesterday, I met with Mr. Lu Yunfu, the technical director of the District Agricultural Field, who spoke in detail about the current situation of the tea industry and various points of improvement. I have selected the main points to record below.</p>
<p>Poor Cultivation: Zhejiang Province has 75 counties, and the tea-producing area covers 62 counties, accounting for more than four-fifths of the province. The total cultivation area is 523,336 *mu*. Shaoxing County alone has 240,000 *mu*. The remaining 13 counties also have suitable climate and soil for planting tea. If expanded, the tea land in the province could reach at least one million *mu*. (Production) Zhejiang Province produces a lot of tea. Last year, the Ministry of Industry sent personnel to investigate and statistics, and the total output was 426,342 *dan*. However, the average yield per *mu* of tea land is only about 80 *jin*, and some yields are less than 20 *jin* per *mu*. Compared with the same area in India, Ceylon, and Japan, it is truly astounding. (Cultivation Method) Most Zhejiang tea is planted in high mountains, which is commonly said to be "tea in high mountains, mulberry in flat land." In fact, although tea trees planted in high mountains have a good fragrance, the yield cannot compete with the flatland tea of India and Ceylon. Therefore, tea trees are not limited to planting in high mountains, and flat land and slopes can also be planted. Tea is mostly planted by broadcasting seeds, and it is better to use strip planting, which can increase the yield. (Intercropping) Most tea-planting farmers treat tea as a sideline business, and other crops are intercropped in the tea land. In the Wenzhou area, sweet potatoes are mostly intercropped. In the Shaoxing area, corn and wheat are used, and in the Ping-shui area, bamboo is intercropped. In Longjing, Hangzhou, mulberry trees are intercropped, which reduces the tea yield. Intercropping is not absolutely impossible, but the crops must be selected to avoid affecting the tea itself. (Fertilizer) Tea trees in the Longjing area of Hangzhou mostly apply human manure and vegetable cakes as fertilizer, so the yield is higher and the tea quality is tender. Although Wenzhou does not apply fertilizer, it cultivates the soil once a year. The Pingshui area of Shaoxing neither fertilizes nor cultivates the soil. It is picked three or four times a year. The soil fertility is greatly depleted, and the yield is decreasing day by day. (Renewal) Renewal is the removal of old branches every two or three years to restore the tree's vigor. In the vicinity of Hangzhou and Wenzhou, the trees are cut off close to the ground every few years, which greatly depletes the soil fertility and affects production. The best renewal method is pruning. After the first tea, the particularly tall branches are pruned to make the tree shape uniform, which is convenient for picking and increases the yield. (Picking) Tea picking is mostly done by female workers. Because they have not been trained and are paid by weight, they aim to pick as much as possible. Old tea and hard branches are often mixed in, which costs more labor during manufacturing and reduces the quality. It is best to stipulate that picking should be done uniformly at three or four buds. (Pest Damage) There are many diseased leaves in tea gardens everywhere, caused by pests such as the tea leafhopper. It is especially severe in the Shaoxing area. Many tea trees withered and died last winter due to cold wind and frost damage. Pest and disease damage is also a problem that should be urgently prevented and controlled in the tea industry. Adulteration and Poor Manufacturing: Zhejiang Province manufactures tea leaves, whether primary or secondary, using manual labor. During the busy tea season, it is difficult to find tea-making workers even at high prices. The tea leaves are allowed to grow old and hard, which reduces the output and increases the cost. In order to save labor and reduce costs, it will be necessary to adopt machinery for all or part of the process in the future. The manufacturing process of tea leaves is roughly as follows: (Manufacturing Method) There is originally no distinction between red and green tea, but there are hundreds of types of tea leaves sold in the market, all of which are due to different manufacturing methods. The green tea manufacturing method is roughly divided into: (1) fixing; (2) rolling; (3) drying; (4) sifting; (5) packing. Red tea is divided into: (1) withering; (2) rolling; (3) fermenting; (4) drying; (5) sifting; (6) packing, etc. The fixing process uses a pot-frying method, and rolling is done by hand or foot, which is quite unsanitary. Red tea fermentation is not as uniform as scientific methods due to inadequate equipment. Drying is done in the sunlight, which reduces the aroma of the tea. (Coloring) Due to the unscientific picking and manufacturing methods, the color of the tea leaves is often not correct. Tea merchants often use poisonous dyes such as Yiji, Huangsan, and Yu Huangdianqing to color the tea. The United States, Britain, France, Russia, and other countries have successively banned imports, which is a fatal blow to Chinese tea. Later, tea merchants sold colored tea to Africa and Australia, which have lower levels of culture, but they have recently been boycotted by Africa and Australia. (Adulteration) Decades ago, foreigners welcomed Chinese tea, and the price increased. The demand exceeded the supply. Tea farmers in Zhejiang Province had the wild idea of picking wild plant leaves in the mountains and mixing them with real tea to make a profit. Later, when foreigners detected it during inspection, the real Chinese tea was also rejected for purchase, and the tea industry plummeted. At present, there are still 6,000 *dan* of fake tea produced annually in Pingyang South and North Ports, Tengwenbao, and Shanmen in Wenzhou (the locals call it "big tea," the fake leaf composition is 10% to 60%, the most common are red firewood heart, oil tea, willow leaves, and Manchurian green) transported out of Gu'ao and sold throughout the country. Therefore, the value of Wenzhou tea, whether real or fake, is only 20 or 30 yuan per *dan*, or even more than ten yuan. Those who make fake tea can still maintain their business, while those who make real tea suffer losses. There are many other malpractices, such as mixing in talc, coal ink, slurry, and water. The quality is poor, which is why Chinese tea cannot compete with other countries in the international market.</p>
<p>Heavy Taxes: Zhejiang Province's transportation is improving day by day, and the tea industry has some hope of development. However, the automobile freight is too high, which is not economical. The government should reduce the freight on exports to save the bankrupt rural economy. (Sales) In recent years, the sales of Chinese tea have stagnated, especially red tea. The reasons are: (1) squeezed out by tea from India, Ceylon, and Japan; (2) poor quality; (3) lack of attention to publicity; (4) high cost. To promote sales, we must start with these four points. (Cost) The cost of planting tea is quite low, but the manufacturing cost must be doubled. Therefore, tea that costs 10 yuan per *dan* must be sold for 40 or 50 yuan to foreign merchants in Shanghai to avoid losses. Tea merchants are exploited by the comprador class, which lowers the tea price, and tea vendors exploit the tea farmers. Tea farmers have no choice but to farm extensively and not invest. (Taxes) Tea farmers have land taxes, tea houses have capital taxes, business taxes, education taxes, charity taxes, etc. Although export tariffs have been exempted, there are still so-called customs declaration fees and wharf donations. Even drinking tea has a tea bowl donation. Taxes are endless and the burden is extremely heavy, which is a major reason for the decline of the tea industry.</p>
<p>Unified Control and Improvement: Now that the problems of the Zhejiang Province tea industry have been clarified, it is possible to prescribe the right remedy to achieve the three major goals of increasing production, improving varieties, and promoting sales. To achieve these goals, it is necessary to implement the three guidelines of scientific cultivation, mechanized manufacturing, and rationalized sales. Based on the guidelines, concrete measures are proposed. (Tea Plantation) Establishing a provincial tea plantation directly under the Agricultural Improvement General Farm. The location is in the tea areas such as Liuxia and Sixiang near Hangzhou. Its mission is to: (1) test and improve methods; (2) train tea industry professionals; (3) serve as the center for tea industry improvement in the province. Establish a branch farm in each of the Shaoxing and Wenzhou districts, and establish a fine tea factory in each of the Ningbo and Yongjia areas. (Talent) Training and promoting talent: (1) Sending agricultural extension workers to study at the tea industry improvement farms in Jiangxi and Anhui, and returning to the province to serve after completing their studies. (2) The provincial tea plantation recruits trainees, and after completing their studies, they are sent to various tea-producing areas to guide. (Unified Control) Implementing a unified control policy, designating the former Wenzhou Prefecture as a red tea area, the former Ningbo-Shaoxing-Taizhou Prefecture as a Pingshui green tea area, the Hangzhou-Huzhou area as a Longjing green tea area, and the Jinhua-Quzhou-Yan Prefecture as a tea reclamation area. The cultivation area, tea output, tea varieties, and cultivation, manufacturing, and transportation are all subject to planned control. The declining Zhejiang tea industry may have hope of revival.</p>
<p>Current Situation of Decline: I met with a leader of the Hangzhou tea industry, Mr. Mou, who said that Hangzhou is a famous tea-producing area. Every spring, tea merchants from Beiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, Nanjing, Shanghai, and other cities gather here. Tea farmers from tea-producing counties in Zhejiang and Anhui provinces, such as Chun'an, Jiande, and Fenshui in Zhejiang, and Huizhou, Tunxi, and Qimen in Anhui, mostly transport their tea to Hangzhou for sale. Each tea firm only collects commissions, acting as an intermediary between the tea farmers and the tea merchants. The sales to the four northeastern provinces are the largest. Since the September 18th Incident, the Japanese puppet regime has levied a 30% import tax on tea, while importing Taiwanese Japanese tea as much as possible to replace Chinese tea and seize the Chinese tea market. Recently, it plans to increase the tax again, so Zhejiang tea has suffered a great loss. When the Northeast was not occupied by Japan, the tea business in one corner of Hangzhou was about 8 to 9 million yuan per year. Last year it was only 3 million yuan. This year's spring tea has already declined, with business being only 1.7 to 1.8 million yuan. The state of decline is evident (15th).</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Establishment of Anti-Smoking Association</h3>
<p>This county previously received an order from the province to organize an Anti-Smoking Committee and issued various regulations to be followed. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Jin, in addition to himself and the chief of the Public Security Bureau as ex-officio members, appointed Wang Zhewu, a standing member of the county party headquarters, and Yin Shisheng and Zhang Shouzhi as members. However, Wang Zhewu resolutely declined to take office. The county magistrate continued to try to persuade him, so no replacement was appointed. Recently, the Anti-Smoking Committee was convened at the county government. The four committee members and the secretary兼任 Wu Zhongyu attended and discussed various points, such as deciding on funding, drawing up a budget, and designating hospitals as smoking cessation centers for addicts to seek treatment. It is heard that the monthly smoking cessation expenses are decided to be 600 yuan, but how to distribute it is still under review. After the start of the anti-smoking campaign, the local cream industry decided to open two stores, inviting merchants to undertake the business in accordance with the regulations and fee payment methods issued. The committee was established and reported to the province for record. The Jin County Government issued orders to its subordinates to comply with the measures for party, government, military service personnel, and school staff and students to quit smoking within a time limit. Starting from the 15th of this month, they will register within two weeks and quit smoking within one month. If a doctor proves that they are unable to quit or relapse after quitting, they will be sent to the military court.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Expediting the Construction of the Suzhou-Changshu Road is Likely to be Shelved</h3>
<p>The Southeast Transportation Expo is scheduled to open in mid-October. This county has been ordered to expedite the construction of the Changtai, Xichang, and Suzhou-Changshu three highways, which are already underway. The Suzhou-Changshu road project has been contracted by Wang Ankan's engineering firm, with an estimated 110,000 cubic meters of earthwork, at a price of 15 cents per cubic meter. The engineering firm has already sent more than 200 workers to Changshu, stationed along the Suzhou-Changshu road to work. However, on the 15th, Dai Pingsheng, a construction section member sent by the county, and Zhang Yunzhai, from the first district office, discovered that the route on the floor plan issued by the Construction Department (Line C) was different from the earthwork calculated by the county construction section when they were setting the stakes along the road in the Walianjing section. The Construction Department's drawing was a cutoff straightening, not following the original route. This county did not abandon the original route in the cutoff straightening, so many of the Construction Department's central stakes were nailed in the paddy fields. Comparing the two, the difference in earthwork was huge, and the difficulty of the work was very different. Therefore, construction could not start. Engineer Dai and others rushed to the Construction Department's Changshu engineering office to ask for instructions. After consultation, it was decided that the Construction Department's floor plan had been approved by the Construction Department and could not be changed. This county's earthwork count was only based on the original route. The authorities temporarily neglected and did not submit the floor plan to the department for record. Neither party was willing to take responsibility for proceeding, so expediting the construction of the Suzhou-Changshu road has been shelved. It is now necessary to ask the Construction Department for instructions on how to proceed. According to engineers, there are now only two options: (1) quickly measure the earthwork on Line C; (2) proceed according to the route measured by Changshu County. However, during this period, the fields will be drained and rice seedlings will be transplanted. If it is delayed further, it will be impossible to obtain mud, which will inevitably delay the project. Then, the original scheduled completion date will be difficult to fulfill. It is also understood that the Changtai Road is contracted by the Suzhou Fuji Company, with an estimated 190,000 cubic meters of earthwork, at a price of 14.9 cents per cubic meter. The contract has been signed and staking has begun.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Opening of Suzhou-Mu Highway is Expected Soon</h3>
<p>It is heard in Mudu, Suzhou that the Suzhou-Mu Highway was previously initiated and invested in by Zhang Yilin and others in order to open the road to automobile traffic as soon as possible and develop rural scenic spots. The Construction Department was presented with a document requesting record, and the Construction Department gave several instructions. (1) The company should coordinate funds to organize the earth foundation and repair bridges and culverts. (2) Determine the planned budget and sign a traffic contract immediately. (3) Six percent of the current payment must be paid on the date of the engineering coordination and contract signing. (4) The engineering will be handled by the Construction Department. After completion, the company will operate the traffic. The initiators expressed their agreement with the above measures and have replied to the Construction Department to comply. The road is expected to be opened to traffic around Double Ten Day.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Villager Dies After Beating Due to Lustful Affair</h3>
<p>A villager named Sun Genshou, age 31, from Xiaozhang Bridge, a place under a large tree in the Second District (Jingyun City), was adopted at the age of four by Zhou Guiquan, a former villager of Zhouxiang Bridge Village in the Tenth District, and married Guiquan's daughter. Recently, Genshou had an affair with a Cai woman from nearby Zoujia Bridge. On the evening of the tenth of this month, Genshou went to the Cai woman's residence for continued pleasure, but was caught by the local villagers, who beat him severely with fists and feet, causing injuries. After Genshou returned home that day, he was bedridden and his condition worsened. He died from his injuries at noon the day before yesterday. His elder brother, Sun Shi'an, reported the incident to the local branch court. The assigned prosecutor held a hearing and ordered the body to be taken back for examination in the countryside today.</p>
<h3>Tobacco Prohibition Committee Handles Smoker Registration</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the local Tobacco Prohibition Committee has been in contact with the Tongren, Puren, and Liaoyang Hospitals to handle matters related to the drug rehabilitation centers. It has also begun to investigate the number of smokers in the county, estimated to be 15,000. This has been reported to the Provincial Tobacco Prohibition Committee for registration and licensing. The committee is also handling the registration of smokers at the county level. However, the general public has not fully understood the meaning of this tobacco prohibition. Therefore, poor results are expected in the upcoming registration. Yesterday, Qian Xinyi, a resident of No. 6 Guangfu Gate, and Zhao Bingren, a resident of No. 51 North Main Street, submitted separate requests to the county government to undertake the business of Wuxi opium paste, named Futai and Yuanda respectively, requesting approval for licenses and permits. However, the county government believes that this matter must be handled with caution to avoid potential abuses, and therefore must wait for provincial approval before establishment.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang: Jiangsu Provincial Security Department Builds Armored Car</h3>
<p>Chen Kebiao, the director of the Jiangsu Provincial Security Department's armory repair shop, has shown great technical creativity. Previously, he invented a portable, versatile machine gun, which was highly praised by his superiors. Recently, he has built an armored car using a heavy truck with steel plates more than one-tenth of an inch thick. Small holes are opened around the car for shooting. The top is circular and can be fitted with one or several heavy machine guns (currently only one). The design is extremely majestic. Construction began last month, and was completed in less than a month. Yesterday, the car was formally test-driven and proved to be extremely maneuverable, marking a new era for armored cars in Jiangsu Province. It is said that the car will soon accompany Director Xiang of the Security Department on an inspection tour of the various highways north of the Yangtze River.</p>
<h3>Haimen County Government Investigates Embezzlement of Corpse Money Case</h3>
<p>In April, a floating corpse was found in the Yuejiao Port of the First District. The corpse had more than 700 yuan in cash. The village chief Liu Ehui, along with Shi Changhai, Yang Xiecai, Chou Cailang, Wang Ruohua, Zhu Xianglang, and others, divided the money amongst themselves. Shi was accused of the crime in a complaint to the county government. The county has repeatedly summoned the defendants, but none have appeared. Later, Chou Cailang was arrested by the port's water police and sent to the county government. After repeated interrogations, the truth was revealed. The county government has decided to continue the trial on the 19th of this month for the sake of thorough investigation. Arrest warrants have been issued to the police for strict detention of the defendants who have failed to appear.</p>
<h3>Sino-British Pharmacy Searched Three Times</h3>
<p>The Sino-British Pharmacy in the county and city was found to be trafficking drugs in Shanghai in late March of this year. The Shanghai District Court sent a letter to the county government to arrest and detain the owner, Pu Zhuping. He was later released on bail. On the 5th of this month, Shen Fengjie and Wan Shaozhou reported the pharmacy to the Nantong District Commissioner's Office. The Commissioner's Office sent staff member Li Guodong, along with the complainants, to Haimen to search the pharmacy. Two wooden barrels and four iron boxes of red pill raw materials were found. The owner, Pu Zhuping, was taken to the Nantong Commissioner's Office. After interrogation, he was detained and not allowed to see visitors. Yesterday (the 14th), the Commissioner's Office sent staff member Jia Zongfu to Haimen again, accompanied by County Magistrate Zhang and many policemen, to search the pharmacy again. A large package of yellow powder, an iron pointed hat box containing a small hat and white powder, and three letters from other places without names were found. The letters vaguely stated things like "Is this item available?" The shop assistants Chen Guoquan, Lu Rusheng, Hu Guanzhou, and Chen Jinyan were taken to the county government. They were secretly interrogated by Judge Xu that evening. This morning (the 15th), the staff member Jia escorted them to the Commissioner's Office to handle the case together.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Northern Jiangsu Cotton Fields Eagerly Await Rain</h3>
<p>The cotton fields in the Tongtai area of northern Jiangsu have increased in size compared to last year. The cotton seeds have also been selected and cultivated by the Provincial Improvement Association. However, due to the prolonged drought without rain for a month, the cotton seedlings have withered and are eagerly awaiting rain.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Fire at Taiping Bridge Kills Two</h3>
<p>The Sanyangtai Nanhua store at No. 24 Zhijie Street, Taiping Bridge, Hangzhou, has been open for ten years and is doing well. At 0:30 on the morning of the 15th, the owner Shen Kunrong and his partners went upstairs to sleep after closing the shop. Unexpectedly, the mosquito coil that had been lit was blown by the wind into the stairway downstairs and caught fire. In an instant, thick smoke filled the area. A police officer on patrol noticed it and quickly blew his whistle and knocked on the store's door. The owner and others woke up in fright, but the stairs had been destroyed. They all jumped out of the windows to escape. The fire brigade rushed to the scene after hearing the alarm and tried their best to put out the fire. A police officer from one of the squads, Wang Rong, bravely rushed into the fire to rescue people. He was seriously injured when the burning beams collapsed on him. He was rescued and sent to the hospital for treatment. The fire was extinguished after more than two hours. Seventeen shops and households were affected, with losses exceeding 20,000 yuan. When the fire was raging, Xie Fangshi, an 68-year-old woman from the Yuhe Sauce Garden at No. 23, and a six-year-old child from the upper floor of Sanyangtai, were unable to escape and died in the fire. It was truly a tragic event.</p>
<h3>Impressions of Economic Survey in Guangxi Province (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Qian Jiaju</p>
<p>However, in the private sphere, the menacing face of merchant capital appears again, because their capital is very limited. Every spring and summer, they often have to borrow money from the bowl merchants as capital, intending to repay it in the future with fired porcelain. Although this kind of loan does not nominally take interest, when it comes to repaying the debt with the bowls, the price is much cheaper than the market price, about two to five copper coins per tube of bowls. This kind of exploitation is even more harmful than high-interest loans, because the total value of a tube of bowls is only thirty or forty copper coins. This kind of lending is extremely common in Luxu. According to our investigation, the amount of lending by Luxu bowl merchants ranges from more than 10,000 yuan to one or two thousand yuan. The active situation of usury in it can be imagined.</p>
<p>After leaving Binyang, I set off for Longzhou. The Yilong Highway is 630 li long and is the worst provincial road in Guangxi. The journey was bumpy and jolting, which was unbearable for ordinary people. Five or six of us who were traveling together vomited for the most part. We really do not understand why such an important highway is not repaired and allowed to deteriorate like this.</p>
<p>Longzhou is located in the upper reaches of the Zuojiang River and the lower reaches of the Guangyuan (also known as Muma River, also known as Gaoping River) and Qiyuan (Qixi River). The western part of the county borders Annam, with its strategic passes. It is indeed a vital border town. Although we currently have nothing to speak of in terms of national defense, when Zhao Ding followed Di Qing to conquer the southern barbarians in the sixth year of Emperor Ryou of the Song Dynasty, he was granted this land hereditarily, called Jiyu Longzhou. During the Qing Dynasty, it was the seat of government and belonged to the Taiping Prefecture. In the second year of the Republic of China, it was changed to Longzhou County. Because it is a remote area in the southwest and occupies an important position in national defense (the current Border Defense Supervision Office is located here), it is highly valued by the general public. Whether in terms of its climate, products, customs, economic life, Longzhou is a particularly interesting area. This place has more summer and less cold. Even in the severe winter, there is only a light frost. Every time the morning sun rises, there is mist between the mountains and valleys, which is the so-called "miasma." Therefore, people in Longzhou have a saying, "Don't get up early, don't eat too much, don't marry small," because "getting up early" easily encounters miasma, "eating too much" easily leads to illness, and "marrying small" is afraid of marrying an Annamese woman as a concubine, causing nationality problems. They also say, "You can't be considered a Longzhou person unless you live here for twenty years," which also emphasizes that it is difficult to adapt to Longzhou's environment, and people from other places easily get sick if they live there.</p>
<p>Longzhou's customs and habits have some things that are particularly worthy of our attention. Women like to wear anklets and go barefoot. They also like to dye their teeth black, using betel leaves and cooked tobacco lime and vines to chew. These have not yet escaped the life of primitive people. As for men, they like to drink and are ashamed to talk about production, so they are known as "lazy" people. However, from our point of view, it is not necessarily that their nature is lazy, because the result of their year-round hard work is often not enough to eat, so they are happy to "get by and do nothing." In the countryside, the exploitation of landlords in Longzhou is also more severe than elsewhere. There is a most peculiar system here, that is, the land tax is borne by the tenant farmers. Probably in the whole county, the tenant farmers who pay the grain account for one-half. I asked them if the rent was reduced since the land tax was borne by the tenant farmers, and they said no, it was still the same. Therefore, a military geographical surveyor from the Border Affairs Military Academy told me, "Farmers often have no food by March or April." We initially didn't believe it at all, but after field investigations, we realized that this was indeed the case.</p>
<p>In 1929, Longzhou was once occupied by Yu Zuoyu's Red Army. After half a year, the government army recovered it. They organized a Zuojiang Revolutionary Committee at that time, with five or six hundred guns. However, the influence of the Red Army in Longzhou does not seem to be serious. Apart from burning land deeds once in the Xiaodong area and extorting huge sums of money from merchants, there were no other actions. They also organized a "Soviet government," with the county magistrate serving as the chairman? Later, because the Communist Party promoted resistance to donations and taxes, the county government had no funds to collect, and the two sides became opposed. When the Guangxi government troops arrived, they thought they were local bandits.</p>
<p>Longzhou has several particularly famous specialties. The first is "gecko," a reptile that looks very similar to a gecko. It is used to soak in wine, and it is said that it can replenish blood and treat pulmonary tuberculosis. However, people who see it for the first time always feel that drinking gecko wine is a bit scary. The second is sago palm flour, which is made by crushing sago palm trees in the spring and taking the flour. Its shape, color, and smell are no different from lotus root flour, but it can also treat red and white dysentery, diarrhea, and other diseases. As for cinnamon and star anise (also known as fennel), most of them are products of Annam (the annual output of star anise in Longzhou also reaches hundreds of thousands of catties). In addition, there are chicken skin fruit, washing fruit, butterfly fruit, shijunzi, umbra plum, blood vine, and "jumping seeds" (produced in Shangxiadong (it is said that when picking them, if you clap the tree and call its name, the shell will crack by itself and the seeds will jump out, hence the name "jumping seeds." This statement is unfounded and not credible.) chasing snakes, golden and silver (both poisonous snakes, soaking them in wine can dispel wind and dampness), etc., and so on. The "water and soil" here are also slightly different from other places, so there are also many strange diseases that we do not understand. The most bizarre is the so-called "chicken ghost syndrome" rumored by the people of Longzhou. It is said that the patient is possessed by a chicken ghost, and the nerves are abnormal. The patient says what is not on their mind, and must eat raw chicken, chicken blood, bananas, and other things every day. If not treated urgently, it can lead to death within half a month. There are old women who specialize in hiding a chicken ghost) as a profession, and only by inviting them to exorcise the ghost can the patient be cured. However, these old women are not really willing to do this kind of thing, because the chicken ghost) is attached to their homes, and they have no choice. This absurd and unfounded superstition is actually said by everyone with certainty, and the listeners also deeply believe in it, which cannot but be said to be a strange thing. We once heard a political authority say, "The chicken ghost syndrome cannot be denied because it lacks scientific basis. When I was young, I took a male servant and passed through Longzhou. This male servant was possessed by a chicken ghost. He was originally from Hunan and did not speak Cantonese, but after being possessed by the chicken ghost, he suddenly spoke fluent Longzhou dialect and went straight to the house of the chicken ghost. He had never known the route before." He also said, "When Lu Rongting was the governor of Guangxi, he poured kerosene on a woman suffering from chicken ghost and burned her to death, thinking that the ghost could also die with her. But the woman shouted loudly before she died: You can't burn me to death. Even if I die, I can still transmit it to others. As a result, the woman was burned to death, but the chicken ghost still exists." After we arrived in Longzhou, we wanted to find out what the so-called "chicken ghost" was all about, but the result was very disappointing. Not only did everyone say different things, but most of them were hearsay and not witnessed, and the far-fetched association was even more ridiculous.</p>
<p>For example, it is said that the chicken ghost can be cured by stamping it with the red cinnabar pen of the county government or the county seal, which further proves its absurdity. However, according to the results of our inquiries with local people in various ways, there is probably a special disease in Longzhou. The patient's eyes turn white, and the nerves are disordered. The patient makes all kinds of strange noises and likes to eat bananas and chicken meat. As for other things, most of them are just stories made up by people who like to exaggerate.</p>
<p>After staying in Longzhou for three days, we returned to Nanning. I won't go into detail about its industrial and commercial conditions here. If we sum up the economic impression of Guangxi, Guangxi is exactly a microcosm of China in terms of foreign trade, that is, almost all inland cities in Guangxi (except for a very few exceptions in Guixian and Babu) have import surpluses with Wuzhou, and Wuzhou has import surpluses with Hong Kong and Guangzhou. In other words, the goods sold by the inland areas are few) and the goods bought from Wuzhou are many, and the situation is the same between Wuzhou and Hong Kong and Guangzhou. This affects the financial aspect and forms a high exchange rate between the inland areas and Wuzhou and between Wuzhou and Hong Kong and a high exchange rate, as well as the outflow of cash. Although this crisis has not yet reached its peak, and has not yet reached the period when it has not broken out, it is undoubtedly latent.</p>
<p>In commerce and finance, Guangxi is also affected by an unhealthy factor in addition to the crisis mentioned above, that is, the rise and fall of the special goods industry (opium) can determine the prosperity and decline of the province's commerce and the vitality and exhaustion of finance. For example, the Guangxi Provincial Bank's loans in Nanning and Wuzhou mostly target special goods merchants, and the deposits of the twenty-four banks in Wuzhou and the ten banks in Nanning are also backed by special goods merchants. Moreover, the commercial bankruptcies in Liuzhou, Nanning, Wuzhou, etc. in recent years have almost all been affected by the amount of opium passing through Guangxi. It goes without saying that the markets in Baise, Chang'an, Qingyuan, and other places all rely on the transit of special goods to maintain themselves.</p>
<p>In terms of industry, Guangxi is still completely stagnant at the stage of handicraft industry, and machine industry is extremely underdeveloped. The so-called "handicraft industry" is actually just small-scale handicraft, and the total production capacity is not enough to supply the needs of the whole province. Moreover, the commodities of imperialism have long seized their inherent spheres of influence, so they do not occupy an important position in the economy. One type of handicraft that is more worthy of our attention and related to economic life is the weaving of local cloth in Guilin and Yulin. However, as we have explained above, its mode of existence is very pitiful and cruel. As for new-style industries, there are only a few factories using power in Wuzhou and Liuzhou. However, these factories also occupy a very unimportant position in the Guangxi economy, and some industries (such as homemade kerosene) are constantly threatened by the dumping of imperialism. Even if some development is occasionally achieved, it is only a matter of luck and a temporary solution.</p>
<p>In terms of land relations, the land problem in Guangxi is also becoming increasingly serious, especially in the southeastern areas that have been exposed to capitalism earlier. Land is becoming increasingly concentrated in the hands of large landlords, and the process of the decline of small and medium-sized landlords and the transformation of owner-farmers into tenant farmers is rapidly advancing. On the other hand, in the northwest, owner-farmers still account for the majority of farmers, but the exhaustion of rural finance has made them increasingly impoverished and bankrupt.</p>
<p>On the other hand, whether in the countryside or in the cities, among the peasants or small handicraft workers, they are all subject to the severe erosion and exploitation of usurious capital and merchant capital, especially the influence of merchant capital, which is more fierce and developed than usury. This is a major internal factor driving the bankruptcy of small farmers. The trinity of usury, merchant capital, and high land rent drives the peasants into the sea of suffering of bankruptcy and decline. If the farmers of Guangxi cannot break the holy alliance of this trinity, they will never be able to liberate themselves from poverty, and the economic revival of Guangxi will never be effectively realized. This can be asserted.</p>
<p>In other words, Guangxi is a typical semi-feudal and semi-colonial economic organization. In terms of production methods, it is stagnant in medieval production technology, but the feudal self-sufficiency has been broken by capitalist commodities. On the other hand, in terms of commerce and consumer goods, it is capitalist, but this capitalistization is passive and semi-colonial. If anyone thinks that this means that capitalist production methods have gained the upper hand, they will undoubtedly be given a ruthless blow. This is my overall impression after this trip to Guangxi. (End)</p>

<h3>Chairman's Speech</h3>
<p>After the bell ringer took his seat, Shi Liangcai was elected as the joint chairman. He reported on the history of the establishment of the two associations, the particularly important missions they bear, and the reasons for holding the joint meeting. He expressed his hope that the members would take responsibility, promote national unity, and seek contact with the international community to cope with the serious situation. He then read a letter from Mr. Zhu Ziqiao from Beiping, stating that his hernia had worsened in the spring and he had come to Beiping to seek treatment at the Xiehe Hospital.

<h3>Meeting Situation</h3>

<h3>Member Speeches</h3>
<p>After the voting procedures were completed, member Mr. Chen Zheqing spoke about the political, economic, agricultural, and transportation conditions of the puppet Manchukuo. All real power was in the hands of the Japanese, and the Japanese methods of anesthetizing the people were particularly cruel. Next, member Mr. Chen Binhe spoke about the dangers of the future of North China. In addition to military oppression, Japan also organized the North China Collaboration Association, with former ambassador to China Kengo Adachi as chairman and dozens of other prominent Korean figures as members, to study China policy and make recommendations to the Japanese government. Their intentions were sinister. In his speech, Adachi even claimed that the Chinese people were aware of the mistake of boycotting Japanese goods and that the authorities were softening or abandoning the so-called anti-Japanese policy, which was an extreme slander. He hoped that the Chinese people would quickly find a way to save the situation. Next, member Mr. Zhang Gongquan spoke about his impressions of his trip to Sichuan, generally saying that Sichuan's politics were gradually becoming unified. Army Commander Liu Fucheng had spoken to him three times, very frankly, but the communist bandits led by Xu Xiangqian within the territory had not yet been wiped out. The financial revenue was 14,000 yuan, and taxes were heavy, causing the people to suffer. Local products were abundant, and if investment from all sides could be attracted, the future would be greatly developed. The transportation industry had made great progress.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Local Association - Report on Association Affairs</h3>

There are currently 161 members, including 12 specialized committee members. (2) Meeting status: This year, there were 12 board meetings, 6 general meetings, 5 meetings of various committees, 2 association affairs discussion meetings, and 34 administrative meetings. (3) General overview of association affairs, divided into the second half of the 22nd year and the first half of the 23rd year, such as the National Products Committee, jointly with the Chinese National Products Production and Sales Cooperation Association, the Women's National Products Promotion Association, and the Family Day Reform Association, initiated the preparation for the Women's National Products Year in the 23rd year, continued to hold national products movements, piloted rural improvement, improved civilian education, and published Shanghai municipal statistics.</p>
<h3>Revision of the Constitution</h3>
<p>At the third annual general meeting of the Local Association, the general affairs group proposed a motion to revise the Shanghai Municipal Local Association Constitution. Article 7 (original): The association holds a general meeting once a month and a board meeting once a month. When necessary, temporary meetings may be held, convened by the chairman. Article 7 (revised): The association holds a general meeting once in March, June, September, and December each year, and a board meeting once a month. When necessary, temporary meetings may be held, convened by the chairman. The resolution was passed.</p>
<h3>Discussion of Proposals</h3>
<p>Local Association member Hua Runquan proposed that the Municipal Authorities be requested to pay attention to the cleanliness of the streets in the old city district in order to emphasize public health. The reason stated was: "After investigation, the old city district of this city is vast in area and densely populated. The amount of taxes paid by the citizens should not be small. However, the municipal facilities are inevitably disappointing. Although the municipal authorities are currently focusing on the construction of the city center area, there may be concerns about neglecting other areas. However, with regard to street cleaning, as long as those in charge pay a little attention, effective results should be visible immediately. It does not seem that there will be a major impact on the financial aspect. However, currently, in various places within the city, except for a few thoroughfares, the rest are littered with excrement and garbage everywhere. Even the garbage collectors arbitrarily dump excrement into the ditches, and the manure carts and garbage trucks are parked on the streets all day long, and no one is taking action to rectify this. As a result, the stench of excrement is overwhelming, and pedestrians hold their noses. This not only hinders hygiene but is also an affront to public decency. If it leads to an epidemic, the danger is even more worrisome. This association is a legitimate local organization in Shanghai, and the name implies that it should forward the above situation to the authorities and plead for the people. Therefore, it is proposed that the municipal government be advised to strictly order the competent authorities to strive for cleanliness in all streets within the city, and to conduct strict and thorough supervision of the work of all manure removers, and manure carts and garbage trucks, and not allow them to park arbitrarily, in order to emphasize hygiene. Is this feasible? Your decision is respectfully requested." The decision was to hand it over to the board of directors for handling.</p>
<h3>Re-election of Directors</h3>
<p>The Local Association, in accordance with Article 3 of the Constitution, stipulates that the term of office for directors is three years, with one-third of the directors being re-elected each year. The terms of office for the first board of directors were divided into one year, two years, and three years, determined by drawing lots. All may be re-elected and re-appointed. Qian Xinzhi, Kui Yanfang, Lin Kanghou, Hu Yunqiu, and Chen Guangfu, the above five persons, were elected at the second annual meeting in June of the 22nd year and will serve until June of the 25th year. Yu Qiaqing, Xu Xinliu, Zhang Xiaolin, Liu Hongsheng, Mu Ouchu, Zhu Ziqiao, Qin Runqing, Guo Shun, and Hu Mengjia, the above ten persons, should draw lots at this year's annual meeting to determine which five of them will serve until June of this year, and the remaining five will serve until June of the 24th year. The drawing of lots determined that Xu Xinliu, Zhang Xiaolin, Zhu Ziqiao, Qin Runqing, and Hu Mengjia, and other five people would complete their terms. In addition, the term of office for the chairman and vice-chairman is two years, and it has now expired. A vote was then held, and the results were announced yesterday: Shi Liangcai was elected as chairman, and Du Yuesheng and Wang Xiaolai were elected as vice-chairmen. Xu Xinliu, Zhang Xiaolin, Zhu Ziqiao, Qin Runqing, and Hu Mengjia, and the other five people were elected as directors (all of the above chairman, vice-chairmen, and directors were re-elected).</p>

The association decided to hold another meeting at the beginning of next month to open the ballots and announce the results.</p>
<h3>Municipal Finances - Strive to Increase Revenue and Reduce Expenditure - Interview with Municipal Government Secretary Guo Shen</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the National Financial Conference convened in Nanjing this time also had a detailed discussion on local finances and made concrete decisions. The original tobacco and alcohol license tax has now been decided to be allocated to local taxes, and each province and city is ordered to organize a donation and tax supervision committee. A reporter from the Central News Agency went to the Municipal Government to inquire about how these two matters will be carried out in this city. Here is an interview with Municipal Government Secretary Guo Shen:</p>
<h3>Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Belongs to the Local Government</h3>
<p>Since the January 28th Incident, it has been particularly difficult to balance income and expenditure in this city. Reconstruction projects and the prosperity of the city center area, in particular, require large sums of money, but as the income side has not been able to increase the burden on the people, the financial authorities of this city are striving to increase revenue and reduce expenditure. Now, the central government, in recognition of the financial difficulties of local governments, has allocated the tobacco and alcohol license tax, which was originally collected by the state, to be collected by local governments. This city has always been a prosperous area for industry and commerce, and in the future, the tax revenue from this item can also be slightly supplemented. However, the Municipal Government is still waiting for the official documents from the central government to arrive before preparing to receive the income from this item.</p>
<h3>Organization of Donation and Tax Supervision Committee</h3>
<p>As for the organization of the Donation and Tax Supervision Committee that the central government intends to order this time, it is because some localities often set up various names and collect exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies. This fact has long been desired to be sanctioned by the central government. After being passed by the National Financial Conference, each province and city is ordered to organize the committee so that there is someone to supervise. However, in the case of this city, the original organization of the Council has been established, and all financial issues are submitted to the Council for review. Therefore, whether or not another organization should be established in the future will be further studied in detail at the Municipal Government Meeting.</p>

<p>[Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Cables the Ministry of Foreign Affairs - Please Conclude a Commercial Treaty with Persia - Please Exchange Documents Before Concluding the Treaty</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday cabled the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Industry, saying: "To the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Industry in Nanjing, on the 15th of this month, we received a letter from the Foreign Tea Trade Association stating that, according to a letter from the Persian merchant Nianmazhi Foreign Firm, Persia imports 12 million to 15 million pounds of black tea annually, about 200,000 to 250,000 boxes, all of which are Indian, Ceylon, Javanese, and Taiwanese black tea. In the past, most of the black tea imported by Persia was Chinese tea. However, since Persia established unequal (i.e., highest and lowest) tariffs, Chinese tea has almost disappeared from the Persian market because Chinese tea imports are subject to the highest tax, while tea from other countries is subject to very low taxes. The lowest tax is ten to five compared to the highest tax. Countries with commercial treaties with Persia are subject to the highest tax, while the lowest tax is enjoyed by countries with commercial treaties. The reason why Chinese tea has disappeared from the Persian market is that there is no commercial treaty with that country. Recently, the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and the Tea Trade Association have made requests to the central government, that is, to conclude a commercial treaty with Persia. Therefore, the former Chinese government once appointed Guo Taiqi to go to Rome to discuss this matter with the Persian minister nearby. However, Guo Taiqi did not go to Rome for this appointment, so the Chinese government's matter has also stalled invisibly. Now that Persia has established a consulate in Shanghai, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs should propose this matter as soon as possible, without delay. A commercial treaty can be proposed immediately, requesting that Persia impose the lowest tax on Chinese tea imports. However, negotiating a commercial treaty will take time, but before the commercial treaty is negotiated, it is only necessary for each party to send a representative to exchange a formal letter, which can be used for most-favored-nation treatment after signing. Therefore, after the treaty is signed, China will benefit more than Persia, because the number of Persian goods shipped to China is very small. Therefore, it is necessary for the Chinese authorities to take the initiative in proposing a commercial treaty, etc." After investigation, the sections mentioned in the letter are all true. The past is gone. For the sake of mending the fold after losing the sheep, the only way is to request your association to forward to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Industry to quickly conclude a commercial treaty with Persia, or as mentioned in the second item of the letter, as long as most-favored-nation treatment can be obtained, it will open up the sales of Chinese tea. At this time when the export of boxed tea is in a slump, if there is anything that can be saved, it should be done in advance. I hope you will investigate and handle it quickly. Greetings, etc., have arrived at the association. After investigation, the treaty of friendship between our country and Persia was signed as early as June of the ninth year of the Republic of China. However, since no separate commercial treaty has been concluded, Chinese tea imported into that country is still taxed according to the tax rate without a treaty. At this time when foreign trade is on the verge of collapse, being able to do one's best is to recover a leak. The original letter said that the revision of the commercial treaty may take time. Before the negotiation is completed, the two countries' representatives should first exchange a formal letter, which can enjoy most-favored-nation treatment. This method is simple and easy to implement. Our country adopted this precedent for Egypt several years ago. All the details have been recorded by your ministry and affiliated association and can be checked. Also, China and Switzerland only have a treaty of friendship and no commercial treaty, but an annex was added after the treaty, stating that before the commercial treaty is established, the people of the two contracting parties enjoy all equal rights to which the people of the most favored nation are now or will be entitled. The trade between China and Persia involves tariff issues, so it can be handled with reference to the previous examples of China-Egypt and China-Switzerland, and can be used for remediation. I hope you will examine and implement it for the public's convenience. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce respectfully requests.</p>

<h3>New Life Movement - Mobilization of Persuasion Teams on the 19th - All Teams from Agriculture, Industry, Commerce, School, Politics, Military, Police, Boy Scouts, etc., Depart to Persuade in Assigned Locations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal New Life Movement Promotion Association, after the establishment of persuasion teams by various agencies and industrial, commercial, academic, military, police, and boy scout groups, has scheduled a general mobilization on the 19th of this month to depart and persuade, and issued a letter to compatriots. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Departure to Persuade</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal New Life Movement Promotion Association Guidance Group sent a letter to various agencies, saying: "At the first meeting of the group on May 24, the chairman reported that it had been decided that for three days from June 14 to June 16, all persuasion teams organized by various agencies should depart to persuade. Now, because the health campaign jointly held by the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau and the Concession Health Department has been changed to start on the 19th of this month, all persuasion teams should also be changed to depart and persuade on the 19th. In addition to the persuasion teams from various schools, whose persuasion scope is temporarily set within and near each school, the persuasion teams organized by other sectors should be assigned appropriate locations by the responsible agencies to depart and persuade. In addition to sending separate letters, we are enclosing a letter for your reference and implementation." It is heard that the Social Affairs Bureau, Education Bureau, Public Security Bureau, Health Bureau, Security Office, Garrison Headquarters, and other agencies have instructed their subordinates to comply with this.</p>
<h3>Letter to Compatriots</h3>
<p>Dear Compatriots, what is life? Life is an activity that seeks the survival of mankind. The content of life includes both material and spiritual aspects. Material life is (food, clothing, housing, and transportation), and spiritual life is (education and recreation). If mankind wants to obtain the material life of (food, clothing, housing, and transportation), they must (work) and interact with others (socialize). If mankind wants to obtain the spiritual life of (education and recreation), they must (be educated) and find (entertainment). In short, the life of mankind is (food, clothing, housing, transportation, work, social interaction, education, and entertainment). The level of culture and the strength of national power in a country depend entirely on the quality of the lifestyle of the general public. Without life, there is no so-called culture, no so-called knowledge, and no so-called morality. Therefore, we can say that the quality of lifestyle is the key to the rise and fall of a country or nation. In the past hundred years, under the invasion and oppression of imperialism, Chinese culture has fallen into a whirlpool, and life has lost its way. The creeds of personal cultivation and public observance left by the ancient sages, |propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame|, have been gradually despised, and the Western spirit of self-improvement and striving for strength has not been fully learned. This has led to the general malaise of the current national lifestyle. From the individual perspective, untidy clothing, unclean food and housing, irregular hours, insufficient luxury, listless spirit, and romantic actions, all these phenomena are fully expressed in the individual's form and there is no (propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame). From the collective perspective, slow and disorderly actions, disorganized and unsystematic actions, selfishness and self-interest without shame, and shirking responsibility and idling without feeling strange, all these phenomena are fully expressed in the form of collective life and there is also no (propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame). In short, these unhealthy lifestyles are a suicidal life for the individual and a precursor to the demise of the country. Now, we don't want to revitalize the nation, but to revitalize the nation, there is only one way. This way is the way of the New Life Movement that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has shown us. Because the purpose of the New Life Movement is to make everyone understand propriety and righteousness, know integrity and shame, be responsible, abide by discipline, emphasize cleanliness, and be punctual. In other words, it is to make us get rid of the old, bad lives of extravagance, licentiousness, corruption, depravity, violence, poverty, filth, listlessness, and slovenliness, and start a new life of neatness, cleanliness, simplicity, frugality, and conformity to propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame. Compatriots, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame were originally the good morals inherent in China. Guanzi said it well, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are the four dimensions of a country. If the four dimensions are not extended, the country will perish. The existence or absence of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame is related to the rise and fall of the country. It can be seen that propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are important to the country. Now, the New Life Movement takes propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame as its central creed. We must not only recognize these, but also incorporate them into our actual lives, that is, we must start from the daily life of food, clothing, housing, transportation, work, education, entertainment, and social interaction. Compatriots, we cannot be separated from daily life, that is, we cannot be without propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame.

<h3>Tsangamoto Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning - Will Go to Fumin Hospital After Disembarking - Will Return Home on the Nagasaki Maru on the 20th</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Hideaki Tsangamoto, the Japanese Vice Consul in Beijing, went missing on the 8th. After our side safely found him on the 13th and sent him back to the Japanese Consulate, he took the Nisshin Shipping Company's Nanyang Maru to Shanghai at noon on the 15th. The ship arrived in Shanghai at 10:50 yesterday morning. Personnel were sent by the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai to greet him. After disembarking, he took the ambulance of Fumin Hospital to rest in Fumin Hospital. After his family arrived in Shanghai, he took a ship back to his country. The situation of his arrival in Shanghai is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Arrival Situation</h3>
<p>Tsangamoto, escorted by Tsukazu, a guard officer sent by the Japanese Consul in Nanjing, left Beijing for Shanghai on the Nanyang Maru on the 15th. The ship passed Wusong at 9:00 yesterday morning and docked at the Nisshin Company wharf next to the Japanese Consulate General at 10:50. Those who came to greet him were only the representative of the Intelligence Office of the Japanese Consulate General, Iwai, and the captain of the Japanese Shanghai Naval Landing Force. The number of Chinese and Japanese newspaper reporters who came to inquire reached more than 20. After the ship docked, the captain of the Japanese Naval Landing Force, servants of the Japanese Consulate, and Chinese and Japanese newspaper reporters all boarded the ship to pay their respects. Tsangamoto was staying in room number 8 in the special cabin. The door was tightly closed, and he refused entry to all reporters. When Tsangamoto disembarked, he also prevented the reporters from approaching him. However, the photographers all scrambled to take pictures. Then, supported by the guard officer Tsukazu, he walked into the Fumin Hospital ambulance number 35, which was parked next to the wharf in advance.</p>

<h3>Immediately to the Hospital</h3>
<p>The ambulance arrived at Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road at 11:05. Still supported by Tsukazu, he walked to the newly built but not fully completed ward of the hospital. Then, he took the elevator to the third floor and entered ward number 309. When a reporter from the Central News Agency was in the same elevator with Tsangamoto, he took the opportunity to ask if he was in good health. Tsangamoto was about to open his mouth to answer, but the guard next to him stopped the reporter from asking questions. Dr. Matsui entered the room to treat him ten minutes later.</p>
<h3>Good Spirit</h3>
<p>Tsangamoto is short in stature, with a small mustache, wearing a soft-brimmed straw hat, a gray suit, and black leather shoes. Although he had two people supporting him when he left the ship and went to the hospital, he often walked ahead quickly. The reporter observed that Tsangamoto was in good spirits and did not appear to be ill.</p>
<h3>Scheduled to Return to Japan</h3>
<p>Tsangamoto will stay in Shanghai for a few days. After his wife, Reiko, and others have completed their private affairs in Beijing, they will bring their children to Shanghai, and then return to their country on the Japanese ship Nagasaki Maru on the 20th. Yano Gaku, the first secretary of the Japanese Embassy, entered Beijing after Tsangamoto went missing. Now that Tsangamoto has been found safely in Shanghai, and his mission has been completed, he arrived in Shanghai by car at 7:20 yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Rent Reduction Movement: Total Mobilization Begins Today</h3>
<h3>Citywide Tenants Unanimously Submit Written Demands to Landlords, Petitioning the Executive Yuan, Municipal Government, and Others to Promptly Order Rent Reduction</h3>
<p>Since the Rent Reduction Movement in this city has been organized and managed by various groups' committees, all districts have responded enthusiastically, establishing numerous branch offices. To date, there are no fewer than five hundred. The municipal government also considers this matter to be of great importance to the people's livelihood and has specifically submitted it to the Municipal Council for discussion. The Municipal Council once convened relevant groups to solicit opinions, highlighting the importance placed on this issue by all parties. It is learned that the Rent Reduction Movement Committee, due to the half-year delay in resolving this matter concretely and the increasingly dangerous disputes between landlords and tenants, convened a meeting a few days ago, resolving to hold a one-week total mobilization starting from the 17th of this month (i.e., today). Various measures have been stipulated and sent to each branch office for implementation. It is also stipulated that from today, all households in the city should post slogans to awaken landlords. A compilation of various news items is recorded below.</p>
<h3>Declaration of Total Mobilization</h3>
<p>The rent reduction movement in this city has recently soared to a high pitch. Considering the current trend, the rent reduction issue has become the most serious social problem. Since the January 28th Incident when Shanghai was destroyed by Japanese imperialists, and internally affected by the collapse of the countryside and declining production, and externally by the world economic panic and the constant aggression of imperialists, all industries and businesses have declined drastically. Except for a small number of property-owning classes and capitalists, the general citizens living in Shanghai are struggling to survive with hardship. On average, rent often accounts for 30% or 50% of daily living expenses. The working masses toil day and night, which is insufficient to feed and clothe their families, and find the heavy burden of high rent unbearable. Although daily necessities like food and clothing can be economized, rent cannot be delayed at all. Otherwise, they will be oppressed by landlords, sued for rent arrears, and forced to move out, with mutual oppression. Consequently, many shops are dragged down and bankrupted, and it is heard every day that residents are being detained. This is a very obvious fact. Currently, the Shanghai market is suffering from commercial depression, financial depletion, and declining prices of goods, but rent continues to increase. Landlords only care about monopolizing real estate businesses and engaging in speculation. Landlords also disregard the livelihood of tenants and only know how to exploit them layer by layer. As a result, the general citizens and shops cannot continue to bear this excessive rent, and the demand for rent reduction arises, and the rent reduction movement expands day by day. Now, the rent reduction issue has become the most serious social problem. Not only do people from all walks of life express sympathy for us, but even expatriates from more than ten countries have joined the rent reduction movement. It can be seen that under the current situation, if concrete solutions are not sought and the burden is not reduced, phenomena such as bankruptcy and unemployment will become more widespread, and the hidden worries about the future of society will be unimaginable. Now, in order to promote the early realization of the rent reduction movement, we have decided that the period from the 17th will be the period of total mobilization for the whole city. The purpose of our mobilization is to unite the majority of citizens, march in unison, use reasonable methods, and request relief from the administrative authorities, and promulgate standard measures for reducing rent as soon as possible. On the one hand, we will actively expand the movement, concentrate the strength of the city's citizens, promote the awakening of landlords of the real estate class, and automatically reduce rent. Only by achieving the prosperity of the market and solving the housing problem, which is one of the four major needs of life, can our mission be completed. However, this matter is of great importance, and it is hoped that greater efforts will be made to jointly achieve this goal.</p>
<h3>Document Submitted to the Municipal Government</h3>
<p>Presented for requesting a clear order for rent reduction to alleviate the people's distress. I humbly submit that China's economic decline has reached its extreme today. The rural economy has fallen into bankruptcy, and urban commerce is declining daily. Taking Shanghai as an example, the decline in business is far from what it used to be. In addition, the January 28th Incident greatly damaged its vitality. Its superficial prosperity is actually emptiness. During times of chaos, disasters, and famine, both the government and the people are striving for recovery to recuperate. However, while the price index for various items is decreasing, rent is still rising, which is undoubtedly a strange phenomenon of abnormal development. The reason for this is that the so-called real estate industry in Shanghai is entirely speculative. With a capital of 30% to 40%, it seeks hundreds of times the profit (refer to the Shanghai Real Estate Association's statement to the Municipal Council). It is resold repeatedly with progressive interest increases, turning the originally stable real estate into a speculative business that only seeks personal gain and disregards public welfare. There are even buildings in the city with monthly rents as high as a thousand taels. Therefore, in the past, it was not easy to find a single room in the so-called prosperous areas, but now there are rows of empty houses with no one asking about them. As for newly built residences, even with the addition of necessary sanitary facilities, they are still rare and expensive, with high rents. They only know how to seek the abnormal development of the real estate industry and do not consider the prosperity of the entire market, which is a strange thing. Moreover, the market is depressed, commerce is declining, and there are many who are forced to close down due to the inability to bear the rent. More businesses that close down means more unemployed people. Some people even resort to desperate measures because they cannot make a living, which has a great impact on social stability. The great relationship between high rent and society can be imagined. Moreover, in terms of the general economic situation, due to the market depression and reduced income, it is fortunate that the price index has decreased, and life can still be maintained. For example, the cost of buying one stone of rice in the past can now buy more than two stones of rice, but rent does not decrease accordingly. Therefore, the cost of a house often accounts for a family's living expenses. Therefore, in the past two years, rent disputes have been increasing, and there are countless cases of lawsuits due to rent arrears and families being ruined by lawsuits. If relief is not sought urgently, the future is unimaginable. Therefore, the plan for the present is to evaluate rent prices and not allow them to be raised arbitrarily. At the same time, the original high rents should be reduced appropriately to reduce the burden on residents and prevent more problems from arising. Therefore, the occurrence of the rent reduction movement is purely a matter of stabilizing society and relieving people's livelihood. Since its initiation, it has been five months, and all residents of the city are looking forward to its realization, hoping to obtain a reasonable and fair solution. However, this matter concerns the overall situation and has a great impact. Your government, as the hub of municipal administration, should not ignore this issue, which concerns the entire social livelihood. Moreover, the capital's rent reduction issue has been resolved and implemented by the Central Political Council, and the Anqing City's 70% rent payment method has also been resolved and promulgated by the provincial government. Shanghai, as the commercial center of the country, should strive for its prosperity and restoration. Therefore, I respectfully present the following situation, imploring Your Excellency to cherish the decline of Shanghai's commerce and the crisis of the social economy, and quickly make a decisive decision to order rent reduction to alleviate the people's distress. I am filled with public gratitude. Respectfully presented to Mayor Wu of Shanghai (Document submitted to the Executive Yuan is similar and omitted).</p>
<h3>Letter to All Landlords</h3>
<p>Respected Sir/Madam, commercial depression has resulted in many empty houses in bustling areas. Instances of voluntarily reducing rent in times of shared hardship are heard. On May 26th, the Shen Bao published a statement from the Real Estate Association to the Municipal Council, which also stated, "Residents' livelihoods are difficult, and they often move from large houses to small houses, and rent out rooms in divided houses. To this day, there is a clear oversupply of houses in Shanghai. Under these circumstances, landlords can only voluntarily reduce rent, and they all engage in rent reduction." The Real Estate Association is a landlord organization. Although the general idea of the statement is to state the decline of the real estate industry and seek understanding, there is still this fair argument and understanding. Is it any different from selling precious treasures to starving people while still seeking understanding? Moreover, the market is depressed, and residents' expenses are reduced accordingly, but it is impossible for rent to be an exception to the reduction. Tenants are really forced to this point and have to sincerely submit a rent reduction request to you. Please reduce the rent in accordance with the measures set by the Rent Reduction Committee in order to maintain mutual affection and make plans for coexistence and co-prosperity, avoiding the failure that comes when the lips are gone, the teeth are cold. The tenants are fortunate, the market is fortunate. I sincerely wish you peace and prosperity.</p>
<h3>Document Submitted to the Three Courts</h3>
<p>Humbly submitted, since the January 28th Incident, Shanghai has been greatly damaged, industries and businesses are declining, and all industries are depressed day by day. Under the extreme oppression of this economic panic, the unemployed and homeless wander the streets, and closed shops are visible everywhere. Although the two necessities of life, clothing and food, have been adjusted due to the decline in prices or tightened by individual ability, the issue of housing has neither the technique of ascending into the sky and shrinking the body, nor the pain of being unable to move suddenly. The rent is surprisingly high, far exceeding its value, and the landlord's oppression makes people unable to live. Although the capital has clearly ordered rent reduction, Shanghai has not yet implemented it. Our association and others are responding to the needs of the times and advocating the movement to reduce rent. The news has spread throughout Shanghai, which shows that reducing rent has become an essential request of all citizens. However, since its implementation, more than half a year has passed. Some landlords who understand the righteousness have voluntarily reduced rent, but the majority of landlords disregard the economy and people's livelihood, using the law as a shield. The cunning even use false attachments and false executions as tools to oppress rent reduction. It is stipulated in Article 442 of the Civil Code that if the leased property is real estate, the parties may petition the court to increase or decrease the rent due to the rise or fall of its value. Although there is no fixed method for calculating the house price, the fact that the market is depressed, and empty houses in bustling areas are unattended is an undeniable fact. Advertisements in newspapers every day reduce prices to attract rent, and real estate mortgages are reduced by silver houses to 70% or 80%, which are clear evidence of its declining value. The current demand for rent reduction is based on facts and in accordance with the law. Moreover, civil litigation requires that the declaration of false attachment and false execution have a condition that there is a risk of being difficult to enforce in the future. The landlord fabricates accusations because the tenant asks for rent reduction, which is expected. However, the court is deceived by it, and there have been repeated incidents of sending personnel to seal and force eviction, causing citizens to believe that the law is set up for landlords. By the time they provide cash and restore the unsealing, they have suffered great losses. For example, 63 tenants in Liancheng Fang, Hongkou, had properly secured guarantees in advance and deposited cash in the bank afterward, and it was obvious that there was no risk of being difficult to enforce, but they were all sealed at once, which is one example. Our association and others dare not have excessive demands on the court in order to seek the development of the market and relieve the suffering of the people, and hope that it will favor one side. Moreover, it is clear that rent reduction has not been clearly ordered, and the judgment of cases lacks a basis, and the investigation and evidence are troublesome. Fortunately, the municipal government has sent a letter to the council to convene both parties to seek a solution as soon as possible. Before this dispute is resolved, concerning rent reduction disputes, we still rely on reality and deal with it impartially, considering the article that the law protects the interests of tenants, and make appropriate and fair delays. If the tenant can provide evidence of depositing rent in the bank, it means that they are requesting rent reduction, not intentionally owing rent. We pray that the landlord's request will be rejected, and the declaration of false attachment and false execution will be temporarily suspended, so that the landlord will be deprived of the opportunity to deceive and oppress, and the tenant will be able to see the hope of recovery. In that case, the gratitude and benevolence will not only be felt by our association. Therefore, I respectfully submit this request, imploring Your Excellency to investigate and implement it. I await your command with utmost urgency. Respectfully presented to the President of the Shanghai First Special District Local Court, the Shanghai Local Court, and the Shanghai Second Special District Local Court.</p>
<h3>Holding a Grand Petition</h3>
<p>In addition to joining with various industry associations and the Rent Reduction Promotion Committee to send representatives to Beijing to petition with official documents, the association also plans to choose a date to convene representatives from various branch offices and jointly hold a grand petition with the city's party and government agencies to achieve its goals.</p>
<h3>China Travel Service Manager Chen Xiangtao Goes to Beijing to Negotiate the Opening of the Railway</h3>
<p>According to the East China News Agency, China and Japan have discussed all the measures for the Pingfan Railway opening, but the date of realization is still difficult to determine because our side's contracting issues have not been resolved. The government authorities are currently continuing to contact the China Travel Service on this matter. The manager of the service, Chen Xiangtao, took the special express train to Beijing at 8 a.m. yesterday to discuss everything with the railway department authorities. A reporter from the East China News Agency visited the service, and the service admitted that Chen had already gone to Beijing, but said it did not know whether he was negotiating the railway opening. Regarding the government authorities' intention to have the service manage the business procedures after the railway opening, it also said that it was a fact. On the one hand, considering that if foreigners were to handle it, the rights and interests would inevitably overflow, so it was a reluctant task. As for the details, it has not yet reached the point of being announced.</p>
<h3>Preliminary Announcement of the Aviation National Salvation Association Meeting</h3>
<h3>Lin Wo Jiang Goes to Beijing Again to Ask for Instructions</h3>
<p>After drafting the meeting rules and other matters for the National Aviation National Salvation Conference convened by the Chinese Aviation Association and submitting them to the Executive Yuan for review, many days have passed without receiving a reply. Therefore, the Secretary-General of the Association, Lin Wo Jiang, entered Beijing again on the night of the 15th to ask the government for instructions. As soon as the order is issued by the Yuan, preparations will be made and letters will be sent to various provinces and cities to send representatives to attend. It is expected that it will open in about two weeks. It is also heard that the meeting of the promoters of the flying club to be convened by the association has been postponed to the end of this month or the beginning of next month because some of them have not sent in their proposals.</p>
<h3>Manufacturers in Penglai Market Oppose Rent Increase</h3>
<h3>Yesterday, They Petitioned the Party and Government Agencies</h3>
<h3>Demanding Measures to Stop It</h3>
<h3>The Authorities Replied to Wait for Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>According to the Dagon News Agency, all the manufacturers in Penglai Market expressed their opposition to the illegal rent increase by the landlord, Kuang Zhongmou, and the trend has been expanding. Because the landlord, Kuang Zhongmou, still shows no sincerity, he has filed lawsuits in court under the name of rent arrears. Under this oppression, all the manufacturers, more than dozens of people, lined up and went to the city party headquarters to petition yesterday morning. Long Peiyun received them. The manufacturers pushed four representatives to express the situation of being oppressed, as well as the concealment of rent, the encroachment of city taxes, and the forced signing of illegal contracts. Mr. Long expressed his acceptance and promised to send personnel to thoroughly investigate and prevent the landlord from increasing the rent. The representatives considered the result satisfactory and then went to the Bureau of Social Affairs, where Section Chief Wu Huanru received them, promising to mediate as much as possible in the shortest possible time, and hoping that the manufacturers would not allow the trend to expand during the mediation period. The representatives retreated in compliance with the instructions and then lined up to petition the municipal government. Because the mayor went to Beijing, the secretary represented him in receiving them, also urging them to wait for a thorough investigation and not allow it to expand. The representatives expressed satisfaction and returned in an orderly manner. It is heard that they have jointly sent letters to various groups for righteous assistance.</p>
<h3>Person in Charge of the Ministry of Finance Talks About Stamp Duty Not Being Designated as Local Tax</h3>
<h3>Subsidies to Offset Insufficient Local Taxes</h3>
<h3>Still Collected and Distributed Uniformly by the Ministry of Finance</h3>
<h3>The Rumor of Provincial Bureau Reorganization Is Completely Inaccurate</h3>
<p>Recently, the rumor that stamp duty would be transferred to local management has been inconsistent, and it is difficult for outsiders to understand the truth. According to the person in charge of the Ministry of Finance yesterday, the fiscal conference decided to reduce surcharges on land tax, abolish excessive taxes and miscellaneous fees, and not hesitate to sacrifice the central government's stamp duty as a subsidy for various localities. This was originally intended to urge implementation. However, stamp duty is originally one of the national taxes and is still collected and distributed uniformly by the Ministry of Finance, not designated as a local tax and transferred to local management. However, in order to rectify taxation and increase revenue, the local government will be responsible for assisting the central tax authorities in earnestly handling the matter. All measures are being studied in detail by the responsible department and have not yet been submitted to the minister for approval and promulgation. The various speculations outside, such as how to handle the transfer to local management and how to reorganize the provincial bureaus, are not without misunderstandings.</p>
<h3>Beijing-Shanghai-Zhejiang-Jiangxi Three Railways</h3>
<h3>Confer on Connecting Passenger Trains</h3>
<h3>Detailed Decisions on Train Schedules</h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, and the Hangzhou-Jiangxi section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway have planned to connect passenger trains. A schedule meeting was held on a passenger train on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. Li Jingwei and Wang Peiqing from the two railway bureaus attended, and Zeng Shirong represented the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. The resolutions are as follows: (1) The case of reserving time for passenger and freight trains to cross the river on the connecting trains of the three railways was resolved. It was decided that passenger trains should connect at the Nanxingqiao Station of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway and the Xixing Riverside Station of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. The time reserved for opening to the middle should not be less than one hour and forty-five minutes. For less than a full carload of goods, the time between the No. 2 freight warehouse at the Zhaikou Station of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway and the Jingjiang Station of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway should not be less than six hours. (2) The case of the opening time of the passenger trains on the three railways connected by the Qianjiang Yidu was resolved. It was decided that the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway should be responsible for negotiating with the Qianjiang Yidu Office. (3) The case of connecting the third passenger train of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway with the Beijing-Zhaikou train of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways. After discussion, it was decided to retain it because the third passenger train of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway must depart around 18:00, while the Beijing-Zhaikou train must arrive at Nanxingqiao Station at 19:47, and the Hangzhou city buses stop running at 6:00 pm, and it is also dangerous to cross the river in the dark. If the third train of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway departs late, passengers to Zhaikou and Jiangxi will not arrive on the same day. (4) The case of adding trains on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was resolved. It was decided to add trains after the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway purchases locomotives. (5) The case of connecting the second train of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway with the 32nd train of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway was resolved. The second train of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was originally planned to depart from Yushan, but because the arrival time at the riverside station was too late, it could not connect with the 32nd train of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, so it still departs from Quxian. In the future, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway will find a way to arrive before 16:00 to connect. In addition, the fourth train of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway will also be appropriately advanced to arrive at 6:00 to connect with the second train of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. (6) The case of each railway having at least one LCL freight train and the connection time of freight trains on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was resolved. It was decided that the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway should temporarily not have freight trains running due to locomotive issues. The Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway should transfer the LCL freight along the way to Zhejiang-Jiangxi on the 39th train to the 11th train of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. At the same time, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway should transfer the LCL freight along the way to Shanghai-Hangzhou on the 12th train to the 42nd train of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway.</p>

<h3>Guo Shun Accused of Encroaching on Real Estate: Settled Out of Court Through Mediation; Plaintiff Applies to Withdraw Private Prosecution</h3>
<p>The base of flat houses adjacent to the Wing On Textile Factory on Yangshupu Lan Road is the property jointly owned by the widow Xu Zhou and Xu Zhang, sisters-in-law, who live there. Last summer, Xu Zhang was in urgent need of money, so she sold it to Wing On Textile Factory alone, and asked the local guarantor Yang Mengyun to certify it. As a result, the land price was agreed to be 11,000 yuan. After the transaction, Xu Zhou raised an objection on the grounds that the land was jointly owned, saying that the land was jointly owned by her sisters-in-law. Xu Zhang's sale was purely a unilateral action and was difficult to acknowledge. She immediately filed a lawsuit against Xu Zhang and the local guarantor Yang Mengyun for selling real estate. The First Special District Local Court has already sentenced them to a fine. However, both defendants refused to accept the sentence, and the case is still under appeal. Xu Zhou then hired a lawyer last month to file a lawsuit against Guo Shun, general manager of Wing On, for encroaching on real estate. The First Special Court repeatedly summoned witnesses to conduct a trial. Guo Shun, accompanied by his brother Guo Le, surrendered and explained the internal organization of Wing On Company and his position. Judge Feng then advised the two parties to try to reconcile out of court. It is now known that the plaintiff Xu Zhou followed the judge's advice to settle the matter peacefully and reconciled with the other party. Yesterday morning was the date for the continuation of the trial. Both the original and defendant parties and their respective lawyers arrived in court one after another. After a while, Judge Feng took the stand. Guo Shun's lawyer Jiang Yiping immediately explained the situation of the out-of-court settlement in this case. The plaintiff's lawyer also applied to withdraw the private prosecution. Judge Feng then questioned and learned from the plaintiff Xu Zhou that the case had been settled and she voluntarily requested to withdraw the lawsuit. The court immediately approved the request and ruled that the case would not be accepted. The case file and contract were handed over to Lawyer Jiang in court to be forwarded to Guo Shun. The case has thus come to an end.</p>
<h3>University Student Accused of Fraudulent Marriage: Reconciliation Possible Between Both Parties; Judge Advises Reconciliation</h3>
<p>Xu Yibin, a student at Fudan University, and Chen Xueqin, a student at Xiguang Girls' Middle School in Wuxi, had a friendship that reached a boiling point. On Double Ten Day last year, they had a physical relationship in room 39 of the Wuxi Railway Hotel. Xu also signed a voluntary marriage agreement and gave it to Chen to strengthen her belief. Unexpectedly, Xu's parents found out about it and expressed their opposition. They also arranged another marriage for Xu. Chen Xueqin then accompanied her father Chen Shengyang to hire lawyer Zou to file a complaint with the First Special Court, accusing Xu Yibin of fraudulent marriage. The details of the interrogation have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui held a continued hearing. Xu Yibin also arrived in court with lawyer Zhang Yuanmei. Lawyer Zhang first stated that the purpose of the plaintiff's lawsuit was entirely to ask the defendant to fulfill the marriage contract. The defendant was extremely willing to do so. Therefore, there was a real possibility of reconciliation in this case. Judge Liu then questioned Xu. Xu admitted to all the points accused by the plaintiff, but denied the point of having a physical relationship. He also said, "I have always loved the plaintiff and am extremely willing to marry her. The other marriage was entirely a unilateral act by the family. I knew nothing about it. I still hope to marry the plaintiff." Judge Liu reviewed the confession and believed that since there was hope for reconciliation in this case, he would grant a postponement in the hope that they could reconcile. Otherwise, this case, because the location of the crime was in Wuxi, etc., may be transferred to the Wuxi court. Therefore, he hoped that they would reconcile quickly to avoid prolonged litigation and cause trouble. He then ordered that the hearing be adjourned to the 26th.</p>
<h3>Discussions on Free Water Supply to the Poor During the Epidemic Period</h3>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News reported that the Engineering Department has sent a letter to the Shanghai Waterworks Company, asking whether it is prepared to continue to provide free tap water to the poor in areas without water pipes during the cholera season, as it did in the previous two years. This year, due to a misunderstanding, the submission of this application was later than in previous years. The outside world therefore believes that the Engineering Department is disregarding its responsibility for the sanitation of the public concession. According to past practice, the Central Epidemic Prevention Department would send a letter to the Engineering Department's Health Department requesting free water supply, and the Health Department would then forward it to the Waterworks Company. This year, the Central Epidemic Prevention Department sent the application letter to Nanjing on April 25 due to a temporary misunderstanding, so the letter did not reach the Engineering Department's Health Department until June 11.</p>
<h3>The People of Laoshusha Oppose the Customs Building an Armory: The Ministry of Finance Appoints Tax Inspector Ding to Discuss with the Public Works Bureau</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs plans to build an armory on Laoshusha in Songnan, which has aroused the opposition of the people of the sand. They have organized a self-defense group and publicly elected representatives to go to Beijing to petition the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Finance and the Shanghai Municipal Government. They have also submitted a petition to the Municipal Government, requesting the withdrawal of the order to delineate areas outside the oil pond.

It is now heard that the Ministry of Finance has appointed Tax Inspector Ding Guitang to discuss and handle the matter with the Shanghai Municipal Public Works Bureau and other bureaus. It is also heard that the Ministry of Finance's reply includes the wording that Tax Inspector Ding and the Municipal Public Works Bureau, etc., should carefully handle this matter together. The people of the sand were slightly relieved upon hearing this and hope that there will be a turning point in this case.</p>

<h3>Public Telephones Universally Installed in Various Post and Telegraph Offices in This City: The Ministry of Communications Instructed the Telephone Bureau Yesterday; The Bureau Will Start Installing Them Immediately</h3>

<h3>Preparation for the Shanghai-Qingpu Long-Distance Bus: The Main Station Is Planned to Be Set Up in Wu Jia Hang</h3>
<p>The eastern section of the Shanghai-Qingpu Road from this city to Zhujie Pavilion in Qingpu has been completed. The western section will be extended to Zhejiang Province. Zhang Guilian and others have gathered comrades to initiate the Shanghai-Qingpu long-distance bus. They have invited Wu Kaixian, Zhang Weicheng, etc., to join. Next year, they will first drive eastward from Qingpu to the concession in this city, with Wu Jia Hang in Qibao, western Shanghai, as the main station. It takes about 20 minutes from the station to the Bund. Because it is a cross-border road construction area, it is necessary to also obtain a concession permit. Everything is under planning.</p>
<h3>The Reaction of the Special District Rickshaw Industry to the Change of Style: Request the Chamber of Commerce to Ask the Engineering Department to Handle It Carefully; Invite Newspaper Reporters to Request Justice</h3>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reported that the Rickshaw Industry Association of the Special District of this city believes that the Rickshaw Committee of the Public Concession Engineering Department's proposal to change the style of rickshaws is unreasonable and intends to deprive rickshaw merchants of their interests. Therefore, it has drafted a proposal and submitted it to the first meeting of the fifth session of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting that the Engineering Department be requested to consider the difficulties of merchants and handle the rickshaw issue carefully. On the 15th, it also invited newspaper reporters from various newspapers to the Atlantic Restaurant, requesting justice. Gu Songmao and Yin Zhiling of the association reported briefly that the Board of Directors of the Engineering Department passed the change of the inherent style of rickshaws on May 30. On the same day, they received a notice from the Rickshaw Committee. The association immediately sent representatives of rickshaw merchants to inquire about the new style of change, but according to the committee, there were no new drawings. Therefore, they felt very surprised. However, the structure of the rickshaw style cannot be changed in one morning or evening. Moreover, whether it is suitable after the change is unknown. If it only seeks formal beauty and does not seek sturdiness and durability, the rickshaw merchants firmly oppose it. Cleanliness and hygiene are the obligations that rickshaw merchants should fulfill. They do not oppose management and inspection. As for the expenses of the Rickshaw Committee, the rickshaw merchants must bear the burden, and a small ocean dollar is drawn from each car every day and submitted to the committee, which is tantamount to depriving the interests of the rickshaw merchants and rickshaw pullers. This kind of unreasonable invisible tax is difficult to accept. They hope that all sectors will give justice and assistance.</p>

<h3>Overcrowded Sampan Causes Disaster: Passengers Fortunately Rescued</h3>
<p>At about 9:00 PM on the 15th, eight carpenters hired a sampan No. 1059 from the Chunjiang Pier in Lujiazui, Pudong, to cross the river. When it arrived at the Jiujiang Road Pier and was about to berth, the ship capsized due to being overcrowded. At that time, the crew of a small ferry of the Huangpu Ferry Company saw the ship in distress and immediately worked together to rescue all eight passengers one by one. One of the passengers was rescued from the cabin. He had drunk too much water and had lost consciousness when he was rescued. Later, he was resuscitated by the ferry personnel using first aid methods. Afterwards, the passengers were taken to the Lujiazui Water Patrol Station for questioning and release. The carpenters all changed to the municipal ferry to cross the river. However, the whereabouts of the sampan boatman are still unknown. He may have fled in fear of punishment and is being investigated by the Water Patrol Station.</p>
<h3>Grand Finale of the Children's Drama Society: Xu Jianping Delivers Closing Remarks; Famous Dramas are Praised as Wonderful</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday was the last day of the grand Children's Drama Society held by the Chinese Children's Welfare Association. Guests from all walks of life were even more crowded. Shanghai celebrities such as Yuan Ludeng, Shi Liangcai, Chen Bingqian, Jiang Yiping, Ma Yingbiao, Lu Shaotang, and Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Fei Meide, Guo Shun, Guo Le, and Kui Yanfang, etc., who attended every day, gathered together in a hall of more than 1,000 people.

Each play was a masterpiece, and the whole audience praised them as wonderful. Also, because it was the last day, it was specially extended by one hour before it was completed. Subsequently, Xu Jianping, the general director of the association, delivered a closing speech, stating that the Chinese Children's Welfare Association is a national organization that has the great mission of seeking the happiness of children throughout the country. It is divided into four groups: protection, relief, hygiene, and education, and strives to promote them. In order to pay attention to the promotion of work and study effective methods, four children's experimental areas have been set up in a corner of Shanghai, such as the Children's Education and Care Home, the Children's Nursery, the Children's Clinic, and the Children's Sanatorium. In addition, it is hoped that the Juvenile Reformatory and the Model Infant Nursing Home, which are planned this year, will be realized. However, the matter is of great importance, and it depends on everyone's help in various ways, so that we can concentrate our efforts to jointly fulfill the mission, create today's children, and become the pillars of the country tomorrow. I represent the association's president Kong and all colleagues to express my deep gratitude to the actors for their enthusiasm and the goodwill of the ladies and gentlemen attending the meeting.</p>
<h3>Chung Hwa Book Company – Facsimile Reprint of the Complete Collection of Illustrations and Writings of Ancient and Modern Times</h3>
<p>The Chung Hwa Book Company, having obtained a Qing copper movable-type edition of the "Complete Collection of Illustrations and Writings of Ancient and Modern Times," has published a facsimile reprint, which has been praised by famous scholars as a treasure of humanity. In March of this year, the company held a public exhibition, displaying the entire collection according to its categories for public viewing, which was a great success. At that time, a certain reporter had planned to visit and see the true face of Mount Lu to broaden their knowledge, but was unfortunately detained by other matters and unable to go, which was a great disappointment. Later, after inquiring with those who had gone to view it, they all said that the book's elegant script, complete preservation, exquisite illustrations, rich materials, meticulous classification, and convenient indexing were all combined in one. It was noted that this edition alone contained a leaf from the "Herbal and Wood" section, which was missing from the collection in the Forbidden City. All unanimously praised it, regarding it as a unique grand view of ancient and modern books, and ridiculed the reporter for missing out on this visual feast. After hearing this, the reporter longed to see it, but since the exhibition had already passed, there was no way to view it. Immediately, following the company's regulations, they sent a letter with a five-cent stamp to request a sample copy to see for themselves. When the sample arrived and they browsed through it, they could not help but slap the table and exclaim its excellence. The book's contents are divided into six compilations: Celestial Phenomena, Geography, Ethics, Natural History, Philosophy, and Economics, further divided into thirty-two sections and six thousand one hundred and nine sub-sections. Each sub-section is further divided into ten categories, totaling one hundred thousand volumes, encompassing ancient and modern times and compiling classics and histories. It is truly China's only encyclopedia. Now, the materials in the book are roughly categorized according to the Dewey Decimal Classification system to show their general outline: (1) Classics can be classified under the General Works section, with all collections of classics and records of various schools of thought distinguished by their types, recording their facts, and including criticisms from various scholars; (2) Sections such as Rituals, Social Interactions, Arts, and the Star-Gazing, Divination, and Astrology sections can be classified under the Philosophy section, with abundant materials available for researching the mind, psychology, and ethics; (3) The Strange and Unusual Phenomena section can be classified under the Religion section, comprehensively covering sacrificial rites, deities, and the origins and branches of Buddhism and Taoism; (4) Sections such as Official Systems, Elections, Personnel Evaluation, Military Affairs, Food and Goods, Auspicious and Penal Laws, Women's Etiquette, Family Rules, and Clan Records can be classified under the Social Sciences section, with everything social sciences encompasses, meticulously recording the differences in political systems throughout history, the rules for selecting and recruiting scholars, the education system, the military's strategies for attack and defense, the advantages and disadvantages of lenient and strict laws, local governance, methods for suppressing bandits, national financial management, as well as the monetary system, weights and measures, women's issues, and family organization; (5) The Philology section belongs to linguistics, containing the origins and branches of scripts, chronologically arranged by dynasty, followed by strokes and phonetics, and then supplemented with the grand theories of various scholars; (6) Sections such as Celestial Phenomena, Seasonal Works, Calendar Systems, Geography, Birds and Insects, Herbs and Trees, Unusual Omen, and Strange and Unusual Phenomena can be classified under Natural Sciences, with detailed illustrations of everything related to heaven, earth, sun, moon, stars, shapes, and degrees, the lunar calendar followed in each dynasty, the differences in customs and festivals in different regions, the evolution of calendrical systems throughout history, as well as every piece of land, stone, insect, and grass; (7) Sections such as Arts, Human Affairs, and Industrial Arts belong to Applied Sciences. The Arts section focuses on medicine, comprehensively covering internal medicine, diagrams of organs and meridians, and various diseases, categorized and combined with the theories of various scholars, with detailed distinctions regarding treatments, prescriptions, and acupuncture for application by future generations. The Human Affairs section describes the structure of the body, the art of hygiene and self-cultivation, and the relationship between age and the body. The Industrial Arts section discusses architecture and engineering; (8) Sections such as Music and Acoustics and the Calligraphy and Painting section of Philology can be classified under Entertainment. Music and Acoustics details the evolution of music and songs throughout history, arranged chronologically by dynasty for easy viewing. As for calligraphy, those skilled in it are listed among famous calligraphers, and any records of calligraphy in unofficial histories are attached to their biographies; (9) The Literature section belongs to Literature, covering the different schools of literary styles throughout history, the individual strengths of the authors, and selecting and recording everything that is rich in diction and embellishment, even if the arguments may be biased. If there are many articles, the best are chosen, and if there are few, both flaws and merits are not abandoned, with categories distinguished, mainly based on diction, exhausting the ability to be detailed; (10) Sections such as Official Geography, Mountains and Rivers, and Border Regions can be classified under History and Geography. Official Geography comprehensively covers the key points of defending mountains, rivers, passes, and fortresses, water conservancy, storage and discharge, the methods of increasing and decreasing post stations, and the ways to change customs and habits and recuperate and rejuvenate. As for mountains, rivers, and ancient sites, they are all classified under miscellaneous records. The Mountains and Rivers section draws a map of each mountain to record its shape and examines its connected areas and adjacent counties, as well as the abundance of water springs and resources in the mountains and the benefits of the winding sources of water, as well as the resources of dangerous obstacles. The Border Regions section records the causes of the rise and fall, division and merger of large and small countries throughout history, and traces the beginning of communication between the most famous large countries and our country and neighboring border regions, as well as the names of dynasties that have changed throughout history. The above categories are classified as such to make the outline slightly clearer. This book was originally compiled by Chen Menglei and completed over three reigns: Shunzhi, Kangxi, and Yongzheng. The Shunzhi period was the initial creation period, the Kangxi period was the revision period, and the Yongzheng period was the completion period. During the Yongzheng period, it was printed using copper movable type, with only sixty-four copies. After that, it was never reprinted. In the tenth year of Guangxu, the Shanghai Tu Shu Ji Cheng Bureau reprinted a flattened-character edition, with many errors. Six years later, the Prime Minister's Office for Foreign Affairs commissioned the Tongwen Guan to reprint one hundred copies in the original size at a price of five thousand yuan per copy. However, due to wars or fires, very few copies remain to this day, with only two copies in the Tsinghua University and the Japanese Cabinet Library. The Chung Hwa Book Company was able to obtain the original book last year, which was no easy feat. The book was formerly collected by the Kong (Yuxuelou), Ye (Huaxi), and Kang (Youwei) families, totaling five thousand and twenty volumes, with sixty-two volumes copied and collated. Now, the copied and collated parts of the original book, due to the inconsistent fonts, have been borrowed from the Wenlan Pavilion collection of Mr. Chen Shuliang, the director of the Zhejiang Provincial Library, for facsimile reproduction. After the book is completed, the fonts and layouts will be uniform. In addition, the twenty-four volumes of textual research, which were not included in the Palace edition of the Guangxu period, will be completely reproduced and attached to the end of the book. The combination of two beauties will make it perfect. However, the book is quite voluminous. At a time when the countryside is collapsing and the world is desolate, if it were reprinted according to the original book, the cost would be too high, and the purchasing power of students from all over the country might not be enough to make it popular. Therefore, it has been changed to a three-fold large format, with nine leaves of the original book combined into one leaf. The selling price can be reduced, and it is also convenient for reviewing, divided into eight hundred copies, with a price of eight hundred yuan. Those who subscribe and pay in full at once will only be charged half price, which is four hundred yuan. Those who subscribe and pay in full before the end of this month will only be charged three hundred and eighty yuan. All books will have book spines added without additional charges. The entire collection will be released starting this autumn, with one hundred copies released each season, completed in two years. There are also exquisitely designed three-seat bookcases with connected rows, four feet five inches high, five feet long, and one foot deep, which are convenient for storage and take up little space. The manufacturing cost is only fifty yuan, and it is up to the customer to decide whether to use them or not. The company has sample pages printed, which will be given away upon request. A separate sample is printed, and a five-cent stamp should be attached to the letter of request, which will be sent immediately, it is said.</p>

<h3>Announcement of the Ningbo Daily Membership Drive – Soliciting Out-of-Town Members to Begin Immediately</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Ningbo Daily has recently been launched into a revival movement by Yu Qiaqing, Fang Jiaobo, and others, holding a general meeting to solicit basic members. Since the opening, each solicitation team has submitted their shares and collected a certain amount. It was decided at the third announcement meeting to extend the closing date. Yesterday was the date of the final announcement, and the newspaper held a special event at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association. The team leaders came to submit their shares enthusiastically. It included Tong Huitang, Tu Qihua, Lou Wenzha, Chen Caitang, Li Jianhou, Chen Zongyou, Ping Manshanren, Zhou Qiansheng, Wang Gaosun, Zhou Yongsheng, and Kong Zhaoyuan, totaling 5,598 shares including the previous ones. The final decision was made to end the solicitation immediately, send letters to each team leader to remit the money by a specific date, and set another date for the closing ceremony. At the same time, the newspaper believes that the goal of this solicitation is still far away. Now that the solicitation in this city has ended, it will start soliciting out-of-town members from now on. In addition to contacting Ningbo fellow villagers in various overseas locations to serve as team leaders, it also asks each solicitation team leader to introduce them widely. The tea party ended at 5:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Young Woman Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>A young woman, Ms. Shen, about eighteen years old, for some unknown reason, suddenly had suicidal thoughts yesterday afternoon around 2:00 PM. She suddenly used a kitchen knife to slit her throat, immediately fell to the ground in extreme pain, and bled profusely.

Suddenly, at 10:30 PM the night before, for some unknown reason, a fire suddenly broke out and quickly spread through the roof, becoming unmanageable. Fortunately, a neighbor, Huang Anxin, spotted it and immediately blew the whistle. Neighbors from the left and right helped to put out the fire, and three buckets of fire extinguishing liquid were brought from the Asia Petroleum Depot to extinguish it. As a result, two thatched houses were burned down.</p>
<h3>Lüban Road Kidnapping Case – Appeals of the Criminals Concluded</h3>
<p>On September 17th of last year, at about 8:00 AM, at the intersection of Route Paul Beau and Lüban Road in the French Concession, a failed kidnapping attempt by bandits against Zhao Liansheng resulted in Zhao's friend Shen Yangchun and chauffeur Chu Youwen being taken away in a car, and they have been missing ever since. At that time, detectives from the French police arrested six bandits, including Gu Junshan, Li Zhongliang, Jin Hanxiang, Lu Guozhong, Wang Zemin, and Yuan Jinhua, who were then brought to the Second Special District Court. After questioning, Gu Junshan, Jin Hanxiang, and Li Zhongliang were sentenced to three years and two months of imprisonment each, Lu Guozhong was sentenced to one year of imprisonment, and Wang and Yuan were found not guilty. Subsequently, Gu, Jin, and Li, dissatisfied with the judgment, appealed to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The case, which has been reported in previous newspapers, has now been concluded by the High Court after investigation. Yesterday, Chief Judge Guo, along with Judges Sun and Fan, and Prosecutor Zhang, held a court hearing. Lawyer Gu Shouxi appeared in court on behalf of the police department.

<h3>In a Small Inn, the Autopsy of a Murdered Young Woman</h3>
<p>At 4:00 PM on the 15th, a man claiming to be Zhu Axing came to the Rongxing Inn at 334 Xinxin Bridge Street in the French Concession with a young woman, Zhu Lu, and booked room number four to stay overnight, claiming that they were husband and wife. Unexpectedly, two hours later, the woman was murdered and strangled to death. The murderer, Zhu Axing, pretended to ask the waiter to order egg fried rice to appease his hunger, but without waiting, he made an excuse to go to the snack shop to urge them to deliver it and escaped. Later, the waiter, Wang Afu, went upstairs to check and discovered that the murderer had fled without a trace. He immediately reported to the French police, who sent detectives to investigate and took the body to the morgue for an autopsy. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday, the police reported to the Second Special Court, which appointed Prosecutor Wang Ren and a forensic doctor to perform the autopsy at the morgue. The autopsy revealed that the deceased was first strangled by the murderer with a trouser belt until she suffocated, and then stabbed ten times in the head and face with a knife. Her left hand was cut twice, and her index and middle fingers were severed, with only a little skin connecting them. After the autopsy, the official sat at the table to review the case. After the detective reported the case, and the Rongxing Inn waiter testified, the official announced that the deceased, Zhu Lu, was confirmed to have been murdered and died. Because there were no family members, the body was photographed and buried by the Tongren Fuyuan Hall. The trouser belt was seized for investigation, and the police department should arrest the accused and bring him to justice.</p>

<h3>Ma Cunkun's Book "The Mandated Territory Issue" Published</h3>
<p>When Japan withdrew from the League of Nations last year, its claim to control the mandated islands in the South Pacific attracted extreme attention internationally. Japan's move was not only intended to undermine the League of Nations and the mandated territory system, but also to build fortresses and naval and air force bases on the mandated territory it controlled, posing a great threat to the countries concerned with the Pacific. Ma Cunkun's new book, "The Mandated Territory Issue," in addition to explaining in detail the nature, evolution, and current situation of the mandated territories in various countries around the world, also has insightful arguments regarding Japan's ambition to control the South Pacific mandated territories and the great impact of this move on the ebb and flow of power in the Pacific. At the end, it provides methods for solving this problem and criticizes the shortcomings of the provisions of the League of Nations Covenant on the mandated territory system, which is very unique. The entire book has nine chapters and contains 100,000 words. It is rich in references, meticulously selected, clearly narrated, and insightful in its arguments. Famous scholars such as Wang Shijie, Luo Wengan, Xie Guansheng, and Liu Shishun have either written inscriptions or prefaces, and Zhu Jiahua has inscribed the cover. It is said that the book has now been published. For the sake of popularization, the price is set at 80 cents, distributed by the Nanjing Bati Bookstore, and all major bookstores across the country sell it on consignment.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous News</h3>
<p>A Jewel Ring Stolen from a Finger. Recently, there have been many pickpockets on trams in the Chinese Concession and other areas. Passengers have their wallets or watches stolen daily, with skillful and varied techniques. Yesterday, during the Double Fifth Festival according to the lunar calendar, there were many visitors to Bansong Garden in the South City. The No. 4 tram of the China General Omnibus Company was extremely crowded, so pickpockets took the opportunity to ply their trade. A Mr. Yang, residing at No. 35, Chunde Lane, Lanwei Ai Road, French Concession, took the No. 4 tram of the China General Omnibus Company from the West Gate to the South Railway Station at around 2:30 PM on business. Mr. Yang was wearing a sapphire ring, set in foreign gold. Because the ring was large and Mr. Yang's finger was thin, he wrapped it with cloth to make it fit. However, while the tram was en route, between Difangting and Meixie Road, Mr. Yang, due to the crowded passengers, held his hand on the window, and the ring was stolen by a thief who cut the cloth around the ring with a knife. Mr. Yang noticed it when he got off the tram at the station, but it was too late. He immediately reported the theft to the police precinct under the city's Public Security Bureau and the China General Omnibus Company to investigate and retrieve the ring.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>To the Editor: Your newspaper published an article on May 16th regarding a dispute over wine expenses on the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Pu'an" ship, stating that it had been resolved yesterday. After investigation, this is not completely accurate. The dispute between the stewards and supervisors of the ship over the allocation of wine expenses was mediated by representatives from the Seamen's Union on behalf of the workers. Our bureau immediately intervened. Although the content of the settlement is similar to what your newspaper reported, the so-called four signed measures did not exist. We are writing to request a correction. Sincerely, the General Affairs Department of the State-Run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, to the Editorial Department of Shen Bao.</p>
<p>To the Editor: We have just learned from the member companies of the Shanghai-Tianjin shipping line that they have read a news item in the Shanghai News (Section 3, Page 12) of the 15th issue of Shen Bao, entitled "Cooperation of Northern Shipping Vessels," which mentions commissions and discounts for flour and rice. After investigation, this is not true. Due to the exceptionally low freight rates on the Shanghai-Tianjin shipping line, which are insufficient to cover expenses, our companies have jointly discussed remedies. Commissions and discounts were not mentioned. Please forward this letter to the newspaper for correction to avoid misinformation. The Shanghai Shipping Association, June 16th.</p>
<h3>[L Reading Q&amp;A&gt;</h3>
<h3>Interest in Reading Literary Books (Continued)</h3>
<p>|Answer to Mr. Gu Nianchun and Mr. Li Xingyu In general, we believe that Mr. Gu and Mr. Li should first understand what literature is and therefore adopt a correct purpose for studying it. For the sake of earning a living, we have to work and farm, even if we know it is a difficult task, but we can still manage to get along, unless we reach the point where we cannot live. No matter what we do, we often do not feel interested at the beginning. If you do not have a fixed goal and strong will, you will develop aversion due to temporary unhappiness, and eventually become depressed. We see that there are many people in the world who are restless and "never finish what they start." They fall into the mud pit of failure because they lack patience and can never generate real interest. If Mr. Gu has just started reading literary books and cannot develop an interest, it is as normal as a child disliking school. However, Mr. Gu must not be as blind as a child. He should have an unyielding ambition for literature, recognize that literature is our lifelong career and is most closely related to our life and society, and deeply believe that literature is interesting. The more in-depth the research, the stronger the interest. Reading reluctantly and forcing oneself to read is the first step we provide for Mr. Gu and Mr. Li in reading literary books. As mentioned earlier, our lives are the deciding point for our study of literature. Therefore, if we want to increase our interest in reading literary books, we must make our lives closer to literary life. What is literary life? In the past, scholars regarded literature as personal entertainment and as knowledge within their own bookshelves, so "closing the door and immersing themselves in study," "not hearing anything outside the window," and even "living leisurely in the forest" were their most appropriate literary lives. But now, our understanding of literature is obviously different. Our literary life is naturally not "closing the door and immersing ourselves in study." Our literature is not knowledge in books, but a microcosm of a broad social life. As social life changes, the main trends in literature also change. Thus, our so-called literary life also changes. If Mr. Li likes to read the novels of Yu Qi and others, but does not like to read the novels of Lu Xun and others, it is because Mr. Li's life is closer to the social phenomena described by Yu Qi and others, and not close to the social phenomena described by Lu Xun and others. Today's literature is to serve the masses, and what is described in literature is the hard life of the masses. Thus, if we want to study literature, we must make our own lives close to the lives of the masses, even becoming one with them. We must run from the "study" into the ranks of the masses, and we must shift our sights from the "desk" to the bottom of society. We must cultivate our own rich mass emotions from the experiences of life. At the very least, we must understand and sympathize with the masses. That kind of emotion is the essence of literature. With this quality, we will inevitably have a further understanding of literature. What can arouse our interest will definitely not be the boring works of romance and chivalry, but only literary works that depict the lives of the masses. Approaching the lives of the masses is the second step we provide for Mr. Gu and Mr. Li in reading literary books.</p>
<p>If we have a solid and correct goal for studying literature, and our lives can be close to the literary life we need, then what remains is only how to gradually increase our interest, that is, how to determine our reading materials based on our own sensibilities. This can be divided into two aspects: "gradual progress" and "sudden progress." In the process of our reading, we cannot ignore the principle of "gradual progress," but we should especially not forget that there is a possibility of making our interest "suddenly progress." Failing to pay attention to sudden progress is the easiest way to fall into the error of being content with the status quo and "letting nature take its course."</p>
<p>The so-called "gradual progress" means not thinking about "reaching the sky in one step," but rather adopting the method of "moving from the shallow to the deep." The main reason why children in private schools "dislike learning" is that the teacher's teaching method is poor. On the one hand, a lively child is suddenly confined. On the other hand, they are given food that children cannot digest at all | The Four Books and Five Classics. How can this not make children see "going to school as going to the execution ground?" Look at the current primary school education, which does not cause such phenomena. For example, if Mr. Gu and Mr. Li have usually only read romance and chivalry novels, then now they can only read the novels of Yu Qi and others. Then they can read the novels of Lu Xun and Mao Dun. Then they can read world classics. In terms of form, they should also start with essays, then short stories, then novels, then famous translations. When reading, in addition to understanding the words, they should pay special attention to what the central description of the work is, and the analysis of the social phenomena related to the subject matter. Because if they do not do this, they will sometimes reduce their interest in the work by understanding it easily without seeking a thorough understanding. Many Chinese teachers often fail when teaching new literature because they ignore this point, causing students to have the illusion that vernacular Chinese is easy to understand.</p>

<h3>Education Director of Jiangsu Province Makes Every Effort to Protect Jiangyin Education</h3>
<p>Letter to County Magistrate Bao to Urge Him (Zhenjiang Correspondence) Zhou Fohai, the Education Director of Jiangsu Province, clearly expressed his attitude towards the Jiangyin education circle's opposition to Education Bureau Director Xiong in a letter to County Magistrate Bao Sixin. The letter is as follows: Brother Sixin, you came to Zhenjiang a few days ago, but Hai went to Beijing, so we could not meet, which is regrettable. Jiangyin education, since the special inspection, the implementation of all plans depends on your efforts and Director Xiong's. I heard that some people in Jiangyin have misunderstandings about Xiong and are spreading leaflets and secretly brewing trouble. I am very saddened to hear this. I do not know what the intentions of the local people are who do not want the local education to be improved day by day. This office is doing its utmost to protect Director Xiong and urge him to implement the plans promulgated by the office, which will not be shaken. In addition to directly informing Director Xiong to work hard, I am also sending this letter to you, hoping that you will urge him to do so nearby and help him solve the difficulties. Sincerely, Zhou Fohai, June 14th.</p>

<h3>Lectures on Family Education Held Yesterday for the First Time, with Keynote Speakers Pan Gongzhan, Li Tingan, Liu Wang Liming, etc., on Topics such as Family Education, Children's Health, and Maternal Love</h3>
<p>The Family Education Lecture Series, organized by the Municipal Children's Welfare Committee, held its first public lecture yesterday at 2:00 PM in the auditorium of the Lake Society. More than 400 men and women attended. The chairwoman was the Mayor Wu's wife.</p>
<p>The master of ceremonies was Hu Shuyi. After the formal opening, Ms. Tang Guanyu gave a report, followed by speeches by Pan Gongzhan, Li Tingan, Liu Wang Liming, and others. Afterwards, there were performances, including a performance by children from Shang Gong Elementary School, a guqin ensemble by Tao Shengrun and Ms. Xiong Shuwan, and Kunqu opera by Ms. Dan Qiongzhi and Mrs. Xu, which were quite wonderful. The Family Industry Cooperative specially provided coupons for domestic products for distribution at the event, the Children's Morning Post provided copies of the Children's Morning Post, and the New Era Bookstore provided family magazines. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM. Excerpts from the speeches are as follows:</p>
<h3>Family Education</h3>
<p>Pan Gongzhan spoke on the importance of family education, stating briefly that education includes two meanings: teaching and upbringing. From the perspective of our lives, we should first nurture and then teach. If we want a small citizen to grow into a healthy national, upbringing and teaching cannot be separated. Goujian, the King of Yue, was oppressed by Wu. He spent ten years accumulating resources and ten years training his people, and eventually destroyed Wu. The so-called accumulation of resources is "upbringing," and training is "teaching." Therefore, education actually includes both aspects. Current school education, ordinary schools in the past have focused on teaching and neglected upbringing. Recently, in addition to teaching knowledge, schools have also paid attention to sports and hygiene, and this phenomenon of neglecting upbringing is gradually being corrected. Social education in China is still in its infancy, even more immature than school education. According to the current situation, it is also making the same mistake as school education in the past, emphasizing teaching and neglecting upbringing. This is not the true purpose of education. The true purpose of education must start with upbringing and then move on to teaching, and family education is the foundation of education. In the past, families only paid attention to upbringing and regarded teaching as something that happened after entering school, leaving it to the schools. Even in upbringing, most families still use old methods, which are not in line with the times. As a result, many children are found to be ill, and the future of the nation is in danger. If we want to revitalize the nation, we must pay attention to education, and family education is an important matter. It is not only important before children enter school, but parents should continue to shoulder this responsibility even after they enter school. Ordinary people divide family education, school education, and social education into three stages, believing that the period before children enter school is the period of family education, the period after entering school is the period of school education, and the period of service in society after graduation is the period of social education, dividing the education of an entire life into three eras. This is a big mistake. It should be known that school education has a fixed time, while family education and social education are not limited by time. As long as a person has a family, they are receiving family education every day. As long as a person lives in society, they are receiving social education every day. Therefore, family education and social education have no time limit and no stage division. They are always in effect. If we want to lay the foundation for education, we should start with family education. If we want to expand the effectiveness of education, we cannot forget social education. Since the importance of family education is so great, we must not neglect it. Moreover, the social environment in Shanghai is bad. If we want to protect children from the influence of the bad society, we must pay even more attention to family education. Recently, the Education Bureau conducted an examination of students in two elementary schools and found that 60% or more had tuberculosis. If we want children to be free from lung disease,</p>
<p>it is not enough to rely on the school authorities, the Education Bureau, and the Health Bureau. Families must cooperate to do this health work. The New Life Movement advocated by Chairman Chiang is successful if families can implement it with their children, and the purpose of family education is achieved. The New Life Movement becomes school education in schools and family education in families. He also hoped that the family education lecture series would use broadcasting in the future, so that the effect would be more widespread.</p>
<h3>Children's Health</h3>
<p>Li Tingan spoke on children's health, briefly stating that health is the foundation of all undertakings, and children's health is especially important. The number of sick children in China now is two or three times more than that of children in foreign countries. Public health is bankrupt. In this time of national crisis, we must have a healthy public in order to resist all difficulties. To have a healthy public, we must have healthy children, and to have healthy children, we must have family education, studying children's nutrition, children's exercise, children's hygiene, and psychological health, etc.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Maternal Love</h3>
<p>Liu Wang Liming spoke on (Maternal Love), briefly stating that first, we must recognize the importance of maternal love. All higher animals have maternal love, which is innate. (Two) Maternal love is the greatest love in the universe. (Three) Maternal love is the center of social universal love. Second, mothers must be rational. Some mothers in wealthy families are either doting or irresponsible, while mothers without money have no way to raise their children. Therefore, we must make mothers rational in raising their children. Third, expand maternal love, contributing one's own children to society and treating the suffering children in society as one's own children.</p>
<h3>Municipal Boy Scouts Council to Open Summer Boy Scout Training Class</h3>
<p>The Municipal Boy Scouts Council, in order to popularize Boy Scout training in the city and to adapt to the Municipal Education Bureau's five-year plan, will open a Boy Scout instructor training class this summer in order to train teachers to serve as instructors for Boy Scout training in primary and secondary schools throughout the city. All primary and secondary school teachers in the city who have a letter of certification from their school can be exempted from tuition and can register for admission directly with the Council at Daji Road, West Gate, from July 1 to 9. It is heard that the training class has borrowed the entire campus of the Dongya Physical Education School in Lujiawan, and has hired Leng Xueqiao, Zhao Weizu, Chen Mengyu, Wang Gang, and Qu Yue as school affairs committee members, Luo Lie as secretary, and has also hired domestic Boy Scout experts as lecturers. Classes are scheduled to begin on July a few day.</p>
<h3>Various Schools Give Farewell to Chen Heqin</h3>
<p>On the 28th, at the Western District Elementary School, the head of the Chinese Education Department of the Public Concession, Mr. Chen Heqin, was granted a special leave to go to Europe to investigate education, etc., as reported in the previous newspaper. It is now learned that Mr. Chen is scheduled to go to Wuhan University on July 4 to attend the annual meeting of the Children's Education Society, and will take a British Blue Funnel Line ship on the 29th. All preparations have been completed. The shipping company, in view of Mr. Chen's outstanding achievements in education, has granted him a round-trip ticket free of charge in accordance with special preferential measures, in order to show its excellence. For this trip, Mr. Chen has decided to first go to England to investigate the education of various schools, and after the investigation in England is completed, he will go to other European countries to conduct the investigation. It is expected that he will be able to return to China in late February next year to cancel his leave and resume his duties. It is heard that Huanqiu Elementary School and other schools have jointly initiated a banquet at the Public Concession Western District Elementary School at 1461 Xinzha Road at 7:30 PM on Thursday, the 28th of this month, to bid farewell to Mr. Chen, to strengthen the trip. In recent days, many schools have expressed their willingness to jointly initiate the event, and there are already more than 100 schools.</p>

<p>Special Article</p>
<h3>The Classical Chinese Movement in Primary and Secondary Schools (1)</h3>
<p>— Wang Maozu</p>
<p>Recently, I read Mr. Wu Yan's article refuting my humble book (Prohibiting the Study of Classical Chinese and Forcing the Study of Confucian Classics), which contains many seemingly correct but actually wrong arguments, and also cites ministerial orders to reinforce his position. I am afraid that the truth will not be revealed, so I have no choice but to refute it more severely.</p>
<p>(1) Mr. Wu laments that the debate between classical Chinese and vernacular Chinese has not yet ended, and that it is the misfortune of the education community. I have to deeply regret Mr. Wu's lack of knowledge and strange views. I believe that as long as classical Chinese does not disappear, this problem will exist for one day. Let me give some examples:</p>
<p>1. Since the religious revolution in Europe, vernacular Chinese has been advocated for more than 400 years, but classical literature is still an essential element of the middle school curriculum, either studied in groups or listed as elective courses. In the early years of middle school, language training is emphasized. 2. After the European War, education in various countries has been mostly reformed. In June 1922, the French Minister of Education, Mleon Berard, proposed a curriculum reform plan to change Latin and Greek into general subjects. (French middle schools are divided into two groups, ancient and modern, for the first four years of the seven-year period). Latin is taught from the first grade, and Greek is taught from the third grade. Students who do not pass Latin, Greek, and French are not allowed to take the degree examination. (The French Baccalsureat is a middle school graduation degree). 3. Since the Labour Party came to power in England, the new middle school system has been quite developed. Scholars are constantly worried about the loss of classics if they do not study ancient literature, so they have organized societies to promote classical cultivation.</p>
<p>2.  American education research and creation have many new differences, and there are many voices of opposition. Here are two excerpts from my study abroad notes:</p>
<p>(1) In September 1919, I transferred to Harvard University and audited the class of Professor Babbitl of Literature. When I left Harvard, I went to his home to ask for advice. The professor told me about the importance of humanism, and shook hands to say goodbye. Professor Dingning instructed me to trust Confucius more and not to trust Dewey.</p>
<p>(2) In March 1920, I went to New York Province with Mr. Yuan Guanlan to visit the Provincial Education Bureau and the Provincial Library. I met the librarian Winmer and talked about education. According to his opinion, the true meaning of education has been lost in the United States. If the true meaning of education is sought, it must be sought in the classics. He is also a believer in humanism, so his opinions are inevitably somewhat biased.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the difference between classical Chinese and vernacular Chinese in our country is definitely not as far as the distance between ancient Western literature and modern languages, so they cannot be compared.</p>
<p>However, scholars from various countries are worried about the loss of classics, while educators in our country hope that the classics of classical Chinese, such as ("Boundless fallen leaves rustle down"), are different.</p>
<p>(2) Looking at the achievements of the so-called New Culture Movement more than ten years ago, it is only that vernacular Chinese has a place in the school curriculum, and nothing else. In those years, the general arguments of those who spoke out were almost two types of excuses to control the other party: one was to find fault, to nitpick, or to scold unreasonably, or to use sharp pens to ridicule to the extreme; the other was to ignore right and wrong, and to give one or two bad examples to suppress them, so that people would not bother to argue, and they would proudly think that they had succeeded. My writing is clumsy and I am not worthy of being praised. However, I regret that Mr. Wu seems to have failed to understand my writing thoroughly, so he has taken words out of context, tampered with words and sentences, and misinterpreted them bit by bit. If he is to cultivate the evil habits of young people being mean, sharp, and cunning, Mr. Wu should be able to realize it. Otherwise, Mr. Wu, in order to defend (the way of vernacular Chinese), does not hesitate to obliterate all facts, which seems to be contrary to the meaning of education.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu quoted Yuan Shikai as emperor, advocating the worship of Confucius and the study of Confucian classics, and Zhang Xun and Zhang Zongchang's followers also advocated the worship of Confucius and the study of Confucian classics, trying to link the restoration of the emperor with the worship of Confucius and the study of Confucian classics, creating an extremely terrifying association. According to Mr. Wu's logic, all those who advocate the worship of Confucius and the study of Confucian classics today are like Yuan Shikai and Zhang Xun, so he hurriedly denies Chen Jitang, He Jian and others' advocacy of studying the classics, in order to avoid causing a backlash, and attributing the fault to the schools. Their intentions can be said to be clever and painstaking. However, everyone knows that good laws and beautiful systems in the world are borrowed by bad people, or under good laws and beautiful systems, bad results occasionally occur. There are many examples. If we must say that this law and this system should be eradicated, then Li Zicheng also held examinations, and the examination system cannot be restored. In January of the fourth year of the Republic of China, the President issued an order, saying,</p>

<h3>Shame and Disgrace</h3>
<p>— Lü Xuan</p>
<p>Children! When you are reading, do you often see two ways of writing the word "恥" (shame)? One is from "心" (heart), and the other is from "止" (stop). But there are two different meanings in it! The word "恥" means a shameful thing, which is heard from the ears and immediately put into the heart. This kind of person will wash away his shame, he is a person with ambition. The word "耻" means that a shameful thing is heard from the ears and then it stops. He never puts shame in his heart.</p>
<p>Our China has suffered countless national humiliations, but has never thought of washing them away, probably because the word "恥" has been written wrong, and the word "耻" has been written instead. Children! You should remember in the future, don't write the word "恥" as "耻" again! And at the same time, I sincerely hope that you: don't just remember the shame by your ears, but quickly remember it in your hearts!</p>
<h3>Practicing the New Life</h3>
<p>— Wang Shouqiu</p>
<p>| Pay Attention to Cleanliness and Orderliness |</p>
<p>Practicing the new life, the first thing to pay attention to is politeness, which the children already know. Now let's talk about the second most important thing: I think the most important thing in the new life is cleanliness and orderliness; cleanliness means being clean, whether it is what you wear on your body or what you eat in your stomach, you must pay attention to the two words cleanliness. Because wearing clean clothes will not be disliked by others: eating clean food will not spread epidemics; especially in this kind of weather, special attention should be paid to this. As for orderliness, it is related to cleanliness. If it is not orderly, then you can't talk about cleanliness at all. However, orderliness does not only refer to the body. The clothes on the body must be orderly, and the bed and desk should also be arranged neatly, so that people can feel beautiful when they see them. You must not be disorganized and make people dislike them!</p>
<p>Children! Cleanliness and orderliness are important conditions in the new life. Let's pay attention to practicing them!</p>
<h3>Who Invented the Telescope?</h3>
<p>— Shi Cong</p>
<p>Who invented the telescope? I think it will be difficult for you children to answer right away? Let me tell you! It was a Dutch child who invented it. I think you must be surprised (?) Don't be surprised, and listen to me slowly.</p>
<p>In the early 17th century, there was an optician in the Netherlands named Janson. One day, his son took a convex lens for mounting eyeglasses and played with it, looking at things near and far. Suddenly, he shouted that he could see the weather vane on the roof of the church right in front of him.</p>
<p>His father heard him, ran out of the shop, took the lens and tried to look at it in the same way. Sure enough, it was much closer than usual without using a lens. Later, he fixed the lens on a board to keep it from moving. This is how the world's first telescope was made.</p>
<p>Later, it was gradually improved and became an indispensable thing in astronomy.</p>
<h3>The Foundation of a House</h3>
<p>— Ren Wei</p>
<p>Lin'er was a child who had just come from the countryside, and everything in this city seemed strange and new to him; especially the towering skyscrapers along the Bund. He had never seen such tall and large houses in the countryside. At the same time, a curious feeling crept into his little heart. He wondered, "The many thatched cottages and small houses in the countryside can't even withstand wind and rain, collapsing and falling down. How is it that such tall buildings don't collapse?" At that moment, Lin'er's father, who was beside him, noticed him staring intently at these magnificent buildings in a daze and couldn't help but ask, "Lin'er, do you have any questions? Why are you standing there blankly?" So Lin'er told his father about the doubts in his heart in great detail. His father said, "This is related to the foundation of the house. Farmers in the countryside are poor and don't have enough resources to lay a solid foundation for their houses, which is why they collapse so quickly. Shanghai is the financial hub of the country, and entrepreneurs have abundant capital. Their buildings don't have to worry about not having enough resources and time to lay an exceptionally solid foundation. Even after hundreds of years, they will remain as solid as ever and will not shake."</p>
<p>Little friends! Your studies in school are no different from laying the foundation of a house: a person must study, just as a house must have a foundation. If you study without effort and diligence, it's like the foundation of a house being laid unsoundly. In the future, you won't be able to stand firm in society!</p>

<h3>The Secret of "Grabbing Thirty"</h3>
<p>— Tian Heweng</p>
<p>Little friends! Don't you like to play "Grabbing Thirty" in your spare time? Do you grab more, or do others grab more from you? Have you read the methods of "Grabbing Thirty" from two friends in the "Spring and Autumn Children's Weekly"? Have you tried them? Have you studied them? Generally speaking, if you want to succeed in something and not fail, you must think carefully! | Naturally, a principle will come out.</p>
<p>According to our research, we have come up with the simplest secret.</p>
<p>You can be sure to grab twenty, and there will be no failure. The method is very simple, seemingly better than what the two friends said the day before yesterday. Therefore, I have to report it to you, little friends. | The secret is only eight words: "If the other person says odd, I say even; if the other person says even, I say odd." If the other person says one, I say two; if the other person says two, I say one. You only need the other person to speak first, | If the other person doesn't know this secret, you can speak first if you want. | As a result, I guarantee you'll grab thirty.</p>
<p>These little tricks are enlightened from mathematics. Isn't it simpler than other methods? There are many wonderful methods in mathematics. Little friends, you might as well ask your teachers to play some "mathematical games" to inspire your wisdom!</p>
<p>Finally, I want to advise little friends to often use your little fists to "huo," | that is, the "huo quan" game at banquets. This is more interesting than grabbing thirty. It can (inspire the mind) (sharpen the eyes) and is very beneficial. But, never gamble for money or drink!</p>
<h3>The Fourteenth Elementary School of Suxian County in the Suburbs</h3>
<p>— Chang Shaoying</p>
<p>Late spring drifts away, and early summer flies in. In this moment, with drizzling rain and gentle breezes, I stand alone on the small pavilion on the north bank of the Hui River, gazing at the moist suburbs, the green grassland, the snow-white rapeseed flowers, and the willow trees that resemble dancing girls. Compared to before the rain, it is particularly fresh and vibrant! It is truly lovely?!</p>
<p>The farmers coming and going on the paths overgrown with weeds all wear soft straw sandals and loose straw raincoats: like schools of small fish, they go to the fields in waves. Looking at the vast fields from afar and listening to the gurgling stream nearby! It seems like the angel of creation is opening the doors: the goddess of nature is humming a song, and the silent bell sounds are slowly transmitted from afar, vaguely carrying tragic and intense emotions: piercing my heart! I can't help but feel a mix of sadness and emotion! I have no heart to look at the suburban scenery anymore! So, I return to school in disappointment.</p>
<h3>Simple Sunny and Rainy Weather Tester</h3>
<p>— Shi Jihong</p>
<p>In the morning, the sun is shining brightly, but in the afternoon, it suddenly starts to rain heavily. Little friends, can you know this in advance? Here, I will teach you how to make a few simple sunny and rainy weather testers that will tell you the sunny and rainy weather. Look at them before going to school, and you will know whether you should bring your rain gear.</p>
<p>Dissolve four or five spoons of salt in a small cup of hot water to make a cup of very concentrated salt water. Soak a piece of very soft, light red blotting paper in it. After it dries, soak it again, so that many tiny salt crystals stick to the blotting paper. Then hang it in the room. When the weather is very good and the air is dry these days, the blotting paper will look white. If it suddenly turns red, you can know that the air contains a lot of moisture, and it will rain.</p>
<p>Sometimes you eat a very hard biscuit with some ginger flavor. This is called a gingerbread biscuit. A gingerbread biscuit can also be used as a sunny and rainy weather tester. Just drill a small hole in the biscuit and tie it with a thin thread. If the weather is bad, the biscuit will become very crispy. Conversely, if the weather is very dry, the biscuit will still be hard.</p>
<p>Insert six or seven newly opened dandelions (the small yellow flowers that look like chrysanthemums on the grass) into a piece of sponge. The stems of the dandelions need to be half an inch long. If it is sunny, the flowers will open. If it is going to rain, all the dandelions will wither. Next time, you will still have to find them to be your simple sunny and rainy weather tester.</p>

<h3>Changes in Air</h3>
<p>— Lin Yin</p>
<p>Little friends, didn't we talk about wind being formed by air vibrations last time? Someone asked me this: "What is air?" I can answer simply: "Air is a gas, colorless and odorless. Although we cannot see its shape, it occupies space like other objects." Don't you believe it? Take an empty cup and put it upside down in the water, and the water will not be able to get inside. Because there is air inside the cup, it does not let the water enter. If the mouth of the cup is slightly tilted, bubbles will immediately appear on the surface of the water, and there will also be water in the cup. "Figure 1" These bubbles are caused by the air coming out from inside. Air sustains the lives of all animals. If you are without air, people cannot live. If you block your mouth and nose, you will die immediately after three to five minutes. "Figure 2" Air is a compound gas of four parts carbon dioxide and one part oxygen. What we need is oxygen, and what we breathe out is carbon dioxide. Therefore, air also has carbon dioxide and water vapor mixed in it.</p>
<p>Water vapor is formed when water is heated and evaporates upward. Seawater and river water are exposed to the sun, and part of it turns into gas and rises. It's like when a wet piece of clothing is baked with fire, you see streams of hot air rising. (Figure 3) Water vapor rises into the air and condenses into clouds when it encounters cold air. If it encounters colder air, it becomes water droplets and falls, which is called rain. (Figure 4) When water vapor evaporates, it does not rise into the sky, but encounters cold air on the ground and condenses, which is called fog and dew. (Figure 5)</p>
<p>The weather is hotter in summer, and more water vapor evaporates and rises, so there is more rainfall in summer. In the past, people generally thought that rain was managed by gods. After reading the above explanation, we can know that this is a change in air!</p>

<p>Little Experiment</p>
<h3>Reading</h3>
<p>— Jian Fen</p>
<p>Little friends: It is easy for your eyes to get hurt if you read in a place where the light is not bright, or if you hold the book too close to your eyes. Over time, you will become nearsighted. To protect our eyes and prevent them from becoming nearsighted, we must: first, not read in a place where the light is not bright; especially after sunset and before the lights are turned on, the light is very dim, and it is best not to read at that time. If you want to read, turn on the lights first to make the light bright before reading. Second, do not hold the book close to your eyes; it is best to hold the book about a foot away from your eyes. Little friends: When you read, remember these two conditions and follow them, and I guarantee that your eyes will not become nearsighted.</p>
<h3>Writing</h3>
<p>Little friends: When we write, our arms should be level, our back straight, our head not tilted, and we should not sit crookedly. If we write like that, not only will the characters be square and correct, but it will also be beneficial and harmless to our body. Otherwise, hunching over, lowering your head, not sitting straight, and not keeping your hands level, just writing there, once, twice... going on like that, it will become a habit and then a characteristic; not only will you not be able to write well, but your back will slowly become a hunchback. Little friends: Do you want to write well? Do you want your back not to become a hunchback? You must develop good habits when you write.</p>
<h3>How to Avoid Lightning Strikes</h3>
<p>— Xi Shi</p>
<p>Spring goes and summer comes? It is very common for there to be heavy thunderstorms in summer, and most people are most afraid of heavy thunderstorms, especially us children. Seeing the bright lightning and the rumbling thunder, we are always thinking about the danger to life. Now let me talk about how to avoid lightning strikes!</p>
<p>When there are dark clouds, heavy rain, and lightning and thunder, we don't need to panic. The important thing is to find a way to stay away from places that are prone to lightning strikes, such as railings, pots, and water taps. As long as they are made of metal, we must be careful to stay away from them. When outdoors, do not stand under trees or next to drainpipes on walls to hide from the rain. Even more, do not run in the wilderness or open fields, especially do not stand on the top of a hill or mountain, because in these places, we are standing in a higher position and are more likely to be targeted by lightning and encounter misfortune. In a train, stay away from the edges of the carriages. When at home, stand in the center of a room away from doors and windows. Then, even if the lightning is severe, it will not be able to do anything to us.</p>
<h3>Correspondence from Rural Little Friends</h3>
<p>— Zi Ming</p>
<p>Herding Cattle</p>
<p>Dear little friends! Farmers in the countryside are very busy. We little friends also have to help our parents with some light work. We can't go to school: it's good that we have a busy season vacation, so we won't miss classes.</p>
<p>The newly hatched chicks not only need to be fed, but also need to be guarded well: crows, hawks, and wild cats can often snatch them away to eat. Although the old hen protects them, her strength is ultimately limited; therefore, my parents have entrusted this responsibility to me.</p>
<p>The adults are busy harvesting and planting; but the old yellow cow cannot stand being hungry. Every day, at the time when the stars are setting in the early morning and when the sun is setting in the west, the little friends each lead their own cows to the riverbank and the graveyard to graze. The little friends gather together, guess riddles, tell stories, sing songs, and hum folk songs, which is very happy. However, sometimes the cows fight each other, which is difficult for us little owners, causing us to cry and scream.</p>
<p>We also have to watch the cow drawing water: we sit on the wheels and read novels, which is very comfortable. At the same time, we also gain the favor of our parents.</p>

<h3>Further Discussion on Nurseries</h3>
<p>— Zi Jiu</p>
<p>And a Reply to Mr. Shishi</p>
<p>On June 2nd, this newspaper's local supplement published an article by Mr. Shishi entitled "Further Discussion on Nurseries and Public Education." It critiques the author's previous article, "On Nurseries and Public Childcare" (see this publication, Issue 15), as being "too optimistic" and expresses concerns. Here I further discuss the doubts with Mr. Shishi, as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Mr. Shishi solemnly declares that he opposes nurseries based on the conditions of the current Chinese society. But I believe that the existence of working women in today's society is a fact. Since society allows working women, for the convenience of working women and for the happiness of their children, there should naturally be a need to establish surrogate childcare organizations. The current establishment of "Labor Nurseries" by public and private organizations in Shanghai proves that there is a need to establish nurseries in fact. And Mr. Shishi himself also admits that there is "no need to criticize or question" the establishment of nurseries based on this "motivation." So why then oppose it? Therefore, Mr. Shishi's own remarks are contradictory.</p>
<p>(2) Mr. Shishi cites the remarks of some great thinkers, especially the progressive feminist Ellen Key, to oppose nurseries, but facts speak louder than words. Opponents may oppose, but practitioners continue to practice. You don't have to go as far as Europe and the United States, let alone look to the Soviet Union. Just look at neighboring Japan, where the establishment of nurseries in large cities is already a well-known fact. Even in remote rural areas, temporary nurseries are established during busy farming seasons. What good does it do to reality to say that "supporters' arguments are not as solid and well-founded as those of opponents"? Why has Mr. Shishi forgotten "reality" again?</p>
<p>(3) The existence of "maternal instinct" in higher animals is a natural phenomenon, especially in humans. But it cannot be said that having "maternal instinct" means being able to "educate." The breastfeeding of apes and the leading of flight by mother swallows are just instincts, and that's all. What humans need is education, good education. The fact tells us that among women, only one or two out of a hundred know how to educate their children. Rather than letting those who can't educate educate the future masters, it is safer and more hopeful to entrust them to nannies with specialized knowledge and who know how to nurture. Mr. Shishi said, "Raising children is not only about physical development, but also about making children mentally healthy," which is very true. But can a mother who is irritable, illiterate, or struggling with hunger and cold be competent? If you want to make these women all able to ideally educate their children, it is better to train a few nannies who know how to educate to take on the task. This is more economical and beneficial. Moreover, in terms of "reality," children in nurseries are definitely happier than at home under the guidance of expert "nannies" and with perfect facilities. Otherwise, the "kindergartens" in our country's education system should be abolished, and those that have been established everywhere should also be closed. (As for the high infant mortality rate in Moscow's public nurseries cited by Mr. Shishi, because he did not indicate the source of the material, I have not been able to find it for the time being, so its reliability remains to be verified.)</p>
<p>The above three points are not empty "theories," but ironclad facts, ironclad realities.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Shishi seems to have many misunderstandings about nurseries themselves, mistaking public childcare for the evils of child ownership by the state. According to advanced countries, the establishment of nurseries has not destroyed families. Even in socialist Soviet Union, where nurseries are so widespread, there has been no talk of abolishing the existence of families. The current Chinese family system is just waiting for nurseries to improve it in part. Moreover, the children generally admitted to nurseries in various countries are mostly over two or three years old, leaving early and returning late, no different from school-age children going to school. As for infants in swaddling clothes, mothers still have to breastfeed themselves, or store breast milk (of course, there is a special preservation method) and have it fed by nannies. Otherwise, they also have to be given human milk and cow's milk that are close to the child's constitution. Mr. Shishi's treating nurseries as the orphanages of our country in the past is a mistake. As for how well the existing or future nurseries in China will perform, this is a matter of method and management, and has nothing to do with principle. We should urge them to gradually become perfect and gradually become widespread, and we should not oppose them because of choking on food.</p>
<h3>Truth and Falsehood</h3>
<p>— Bi Yao</p>
<p>In the past, "motherly love" was considered the most sacred and noble; women certainly played out a life-or-death performance on this. Today, many great men, for matters of state, so-called "bearing humiliation and carrying heavy burdens," so-called "lying on firewood and tasting gall," so-called "fearless completion"), all sorts of great, meritorious, patriotic actions are roughly similar to their love for their sons.</p>
<p>After something is considered sacred and precious, people will naturally compete for it. Within the love of family, there are husbands competing for "fatherly love," children competing for "filial piety," brothers competing for "brotherly love," etc.; just like the current love of country and saving the country, there are also so-called "saving the country through song and dance," "saving the country by worshiping Buddha," "saving the country by buying lottery tickets," and the like. However, speaking of the mother's love for her son, and the great man's long-term resistance to the love of his country, it is the most credible of the many competitors.</p>
<p>But this "love" must grasp real objects to express: how can a wandering Jew love his country? A woman without children cannot complete her "motherly love." Thus, in order to complete their "supreme love," looking only at women, the competition for real objects is not uncommon. And the debate between "true mother" and "false mother" is often a difficult problem to resolve.</p>
<p>"In the Edo region of Japan in the past, there was a widow who entrusted her baby to someone else and went outside to work. A few years later, she wanted to take her child back, but the adoptive mother would not admit that this had happened. The two sides argued, and went to the magistrate to file a lawsuit. The magistrate thought carefully, and ordered them to take the child and put it between the two women. Each of them pulled one of the child's hands, and whoever pulled the child over would win the lawsuit. The two sides pulled hard, and the child cried out in pain, and one woman let go. So the magistrate judged: 'The one who doesn't care that the child is crying must be a cunning and unfeeling thing, the one who let go is the child's true mother.'" In this story, the discerning reader should applaud the wise magistrate's verdict. If you only care about your own victory, regardless of the child's pain, the little hand is broken, the little life is pulled away, this is certainly not something a true mother would have the heart to do; even if she could do it, how would she be any different from the false mother? There is no other natural marker between the true mother and the false mother, but to see if she has the heart to harm.</p>
<p>Not only motherly love, but all love cannot contain the heart to harm. Humans can generally be divided into two absolute categories: one is to completely sacrifice themselves to love the broad social masses; the other is to completely harm others to benefit themselves. The difference between the two is as clear as the distinction between bright day and black night. However, gray dawn and dusk are allowed in between, allowing those mediocre talents to fear shrinking and wandering confusedly in this realm.</p>
<p>True and pure motherly love, she only hopes that her son will grow up healthy, and will not wrongly make her son resemble her, be filial to her, or belong to her, like the false mother who snatches another's child to make her own, although she seems to have fulfilled the duties of a mother in nurturing and running it; however, once she cannot achieve the possessive desire of "belonging to her," the little life can be immediately cut off in her hands. She only has "false love" after all. Fortunately, she was unable to deceive the wise judgment of the wise magistrate at that time, and the little life was finally able to be saved. This cannot help but remind people of the Jewish nation more than two thousand years ago, which disintegrated for no reason into the two countries of Israel and Judah, and killed each other every day, making it easier for foreign tribes to multiply; among them, I wonder if there were any false scholars who wrongly harmed others to achieve their own selfishness? I really want to raise the dead and ask them. However, today, two thousand years later, even if there is a wise "splitting the coffin and making a ruling," what benefit is there to the wandering of the Jewish nation?</p>
<h3>After Reading "A Woman's Heart"</h3>
<p>— Lan Ru</p>
<p>|Dedicated to Miss Xian|</p>
<p>Unacquainted Miss Xian:</p>
<p>After reading your "A Woman's Heart" in the Women's Garden (Issue 10) on April 22nd, many thoughts arose within me. You are indeed "too good!" For a husband who does not truly love you and deceives you, you are sacrificing your precious youth, even your entire life, if you do not awaken.</p>
<p>You so earnestly hope that someone will tell you, "Right or wrong," you so passionately "seek only true human sympathy and the final judgment of justice." I am one of those who want to tell you "wrong." My words may be a bit too frank, direct, or, to put it bluntly, too crude, but please believe that my intentions are purely good, and I am a female friend who sympathizes with you deeply—although we have not yet met or exchanged letters. I dare to believe that all oppressed women and men in China, even the world, are our good friends.</p>
<p>You admit that you are a weakling, which is not unfair at all, and I must add that you are "too cowardly!"</p>
<p>Women are most rich in emotions, and thus often misled by them; women are most easily deceived—aside from money, status, and reputation, just a few sweet words or letters can win the heart of a pure and passionate young woman; women are most easily moved, and if a suitor threatens suicide or feigns lovesickness to win love, few will refuse. You, Miss Xian, are such a woman, and that is why you have fallen into a sea of bitterness, creating a painful reality and a dim future!</p>
<p>Why couldn't you refuse his coercion in the first place? It was because you were too easily moved and lacked courage! It wasn't that you were deeply in love with him, but rather that he used "suicide" and wrote "blood letters" to force you to marry him. This was already doomed to be an unsuccessful and unhappy marriage. Moreover, even after living together for five years, you still lead a life of "sexual and emotional disharmony," and he even beats you sometimes. Alas! Why is your tolerance so great?</p>
<p>When you were living such a life of extreme conflict, you lacked the courage to divorce him. This was naturally due to the so-called morality and personality of feudal society dominating you, but perhaps the greater force was the three children. Alas, women, women, if they don't die at the hands of their husbands, they will be sacrificed for their children! Why don't you consider that when the children grow up, they belong to society, not just to you personally? Why should you be their beast of burden all day long, struggling to raise them? Aren't there orphanages and nurseries where they can be sent?</p>
<p>Knowing that he has been living with another woman for over a year and has even had a child, do you still believe his lies? Why did you send the children to him in the hope of maintaining a connection? At this point, you should be thoroughly awakened! Stop being deceived by him and seduced by his sweet words ("repentance")? These are their usual tricks. Why are you so compassionate and forgiving, pitying him?</p>
<p>You regret not suspecting him when you brought the children back to Hunan, but that's unnecessary. When love has reached the point of using deception, everything is over. Even if you hadn't returned to Hunan, what good would it have done?</p>
<p>Now that things have come to this, sadness is useless. I hope you will fully awaken and become a new woman with thoughts, aspirations, and courage. Stop drifting in the sea of love's bitterness and suffering for your children. You should strive for liberation and not rely on the final judgment of justice. You should seek your own independence and not hope for human sympathy. Of course, justice and sympathy can be found everywhere, but everyone sympathizes with you out of pity. We must be people who do not need to be pitied!</p>
<p>Quickly abandon your children and hand them over to society to manage! Do not sacrifice your life for them; but if you insist on being a virtuous wife and good mother in the old society, that is, of course, your freedom, and no one can interfere.</p>
<p>I have written too much. In fact, I should have just said the word "wrong" and been done with it. I wish you strength, Miss!</p>
<h3>Methods of Raising Newborns</h3>
<p>— You Bai</p>
<p>The ten days from a child's birth until the umbilical cord falls off are called the newborn period. The newborn period is the beginning of life, and whether the methods of raising the child are appropriate or not has a great impact on their future health. Here are some of the most important points, explained as follows:</p>
<p>Harm of Holding While Sleeping: Many mothers like to hold their children while sleeping, originally out of love. However, the result is often the opposite: not only does it disturb the mother's sleep, but it also prevents the newborn from getting free and restful sleep. Both mother and child suffer, creating future problems. This period is when both mother and child need absolute rest. To ensure that both can get sufficient sleep in free positions, there is no better method than sleeping in separate beds.</p>
<p>Feeding Time: Ideally, every two hours during the day and every four hours at night. Establishing this habit can prevent oversights. Each feeding should last about ten minutes.</p>
<p>Keeping the Infant Warm: Before leaving the mother's body, the infant was part of the mother. Now, suddenly separated from the warm mother, living alone, and without fully developed temperature regulation, they are extremely susceptible to cold. Therefore, keeping the infant warm is an important part of childcare.</p>
<p>Umbilical Cord and Germs: The umbilical cord is a major entry point for infant diseases. It is cut off immediately after birth, and the wound takes two to three days to heal completely. If mold invades this unhealed wound, it can cause various terrible diseases, such as tetanus, sepsis, erysipelas, and pneumonia. To avoid these dangers, pay attention to the cleanliness and dryness of the umbilical cord. The umbilical cord will gradually dry and fall off naturally after a week.</p>
<p>Bathing and the Umbilical Cord: Opinions differ on whether newborns should be bathed. For the first three weeks after birth, the umbilical area is not yet true skin, and mold can easily enter during bathing. Therefore, after bathing, it is essential to cover the area with dry gauze to ensure it is completely dry.</p>
<p>Bathing: The bathing time should be five to ten minutes each time, and the temperature should be 38-39 degrees Celsius. Hold the baby's chest with the left forearm, immersing them in the water, and gently rub the baby with boracic acid soap with the right hand, paying particular attention to the armpits and groin. Then, dry the whole body and sprinkle it with a slightly irritating powder to prevent skin breakdown.</p>
<p>Stool: Newborns pass black stool on the day of birth or the next day, which is slightly streaked and called meconium. It is a mixture of waste in the intestines and amniotic fluid ingested during fetal life. After breastfeeding, its form changes, becoming what is called breast milk stool, which is a yolk-like soft substance, usually once or twice a day.</p>
<h3>Summary of Laws</h3>
<p>To enhance women's legal knowledge, this publication has specially created the "Summary of Laws" section starting from this issue, excerpting various laws directly related to women's lives for reference. Editor</p>

<h3>Sleep and Food</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Sleep is a natural tonic, but with world civilization, insomnia is increasing with the times. There are various methods for treating insomnia, and food also has a great impact on sleep. The types and reasons for sleep-promoting foods and sleep-disturbing foods are described below:</p>
<p>Sleep-Promoting Foods: Fruits, radishes, etc., contain digestive enzymes that can help with food digestion, which reduces retention in the abdomen, naturally promoting sleep. As for potatoes and taro, because the starch is more difficult to digest, they can easily cause abdominal bloating and a heavy head, affecting sleep. However, the fiber in taro and the fruit acids in fruits have a laxative effect, which is also a condition that promotes sleep.</p>
<p>Foods That Hinder Sleep: Milk, egg whites, meat, etc., are all proteins that easily cause abdominal bloating and affect the nerves, causing a heavy head. Unknowingly, it becomes difficult to fall asleep. Other stimulants such as tea and coffee, and irritants such as pepper and fennel, can easily make people excited and lead to insomnia.</p>
<h3>A Woman Aviator of the World</h3>
<p>— Xu Xuewen</p>
<p>||Amy Johnson||</p>
<p>The aviation industry is now making rapid progress. More and more women are entering the aviation field. The most sensational long-distance flight was the circumnavigation of the earth by German Dr. Eckener in 1926 in a Zeppelin. Secondly, the flight across the Atlantic by American aviator Lindbergh in a single-engine plane in 1927 was also amazing to the general public. However, in 1930, a brave female aviator emerged, named Amy Johnson, a British national, who flew from England to Australia in 19 days. The length of the route was three times that of flying across the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Her Background and Initial Flight</p>
<p>Amy Johnson's grandfather was a Dane who settled in Hull, England, at the age of sixteen and engaged in fishing. Later, Amy Johnson's father also lived in Hull and worked in fishing. So, Amy Johnson was the daughter of a fisherman.</p>
<p>She loved listening to adventure stories in her childhood. She had a lively nature and cheerful spirit, unlike a shy and pensive girl. As she grew older, she often practiced shooting at targets by the seashore. At the age of twenty-two, she took her younger sister on an airplane ride around Hull. At that time, she felt that she was flying high in the blue sky, passing through white snowdrifts, and soon slowly descending towards the green earth, which was such a fresh and transcendent life. She felt a special joy in flying. This was her first attempt, and it only cost five shillings.</p>
<p>Joining the London Aeroplane Club</p>
<p>From then on, Amy Johnson's interest in aviation life grew stronger day by day. When she looked up and saw airplanes circling in the sky, she couldn't help but envy them. She often thought, "If I could also fly a plane, circling in the sky and viewing various places, how happy would that be?" At that time, she was working as a clerk in a law office in London, and she only felt that life was monotonous. Moreover, the streets of London were very noisy. Every day, she took the bus to rush to the office, and she really couldn't feel any new interest.</p>
<p>However, learning to fly was a luxury. How could she afford it with the income of a clerk? So, although she admired it in her heart, she could only stare at others flying in the sky.</p>
<p>Later, she learned that there was a place where she could learn to fly at a lower cost. So, in September 1928, as a woman who knew nothing about airplanes, she resolutely joined the London Aeroplane Club.</p>
<p>The profession of a clerk sitting in an office was naturally even less interesting. However, she still tried her best to persevere because losing her job in the early stages would greatly affect her future career. With this in mind, she devoted herself to her work and her interesting career, and therefore she worked even harder than usual.</p>
<p>Busy Life</p>
<p>She stopped all swimming, tennis, and dancing, and saved money to learn flying lessons. The cost of flying lessons at the club was one pound per hour, so she had to save ten shillings every week, and after two weeks, she could pay the tuition for flying lessons. The teachers at the club valued her very much. The first time, they took her for a half-hour flight around the airfield, and then they let her practice alone. So, her daily life was extremely busy. From nine to five, she was working as a clerk in the office. From six to nine in the morning and from five in the afternoon to midnight, she had to put on her flying gear to learn to fly. She had to learn not only flying skills but also flying theory. She gradually intended to make flying her career. Therefore, she decided to become an apprentice to the engineer Ham, in order to learn the mechanics of airplanes in practice. Therefore, in addition to practicing flying, she spent all her time dismantling engines and installing engines. After that, she further learned mechanics and the structure of various parts of the aircraft.</p>
<p>Achievements of Two Flights</p>
<p>Amy Johnson joined the flying club not long ago, but she made extraordinary progress. So, she made her first test flight on September 15th, only two weeks after joining. On this day, she flew with two people, but there was wind, rain, and fog. She was not discouraged at all, and she flew with her companion for more than fifteen hours. On June 9th of the following year, she flew again. This time, she flew alone, but she achieved extraordinary results. So, on June 36th, she obtained a private pilot's certificate. Soon after, she also obtained a certificate as an airfield engineer. She was the first woman in England to obtain this certificate.</p>
<p>Therefore, the teacher Ham praised her to others like this: This flight of Amy Johnson can make people imagine what kind of person she is. You must know that to make such a flight, you must have great physical strength and endurance. In flight, you must not only drive the machinery, watch the map, but also use a pump to pump gasoline and pour it into the oil tank. Therefore, to pump fifty gallons of oil, the right hand must perform three thousand times of action.</p>
<p>Reading the above paragraph, we can also know her strong physique and her hard-working attitude to deal with her work.</p>
<p>Motivation and Frustration in Flying to Australia</p>
<p>Because of the astonishing achievements of the two flights, she wanted to decide to become a professional pilot. However, to be a commercial pilot, you must have one hundred hours of flying experience. Her flights, before and after, totaled ninety hours and forty-five minutes, so she could not get a commercial pilot's certificate. This was the first difficulty. Also, even if she worked as an aircraft salesperson, the employer would definitely not be happy to let her lead the test flight because she was a woman. This was the second difficulty.</p>
<p>She finally decided to set off on May 5, 1930, for a long-distance flight, that is, from England to Australia, to show people her great flight, and at the same time, use this to obtain the commercial pilot's certificate.</p>
<p>However, the general ridicule also came with it. A month before her departure, an Australian newspaper heard the news and quoted a passage from an aviator, saying, "This is just a girl's momentary fantasy, wanting to make such a flight." She was extremely angry, cut out this passage, and said that when she arrived in Australia, she would definitely throw it in that person's face.</p>
<p>She also asked the general manager of an oil company for help, but the result was that he persuaded her not to make this trip. Later, she asked many people, but all she got was ridicule or outright refusal.</p>
<p>Finally, she thought of asking people from the newspaper for sponsorship because newspapers originally welcomed people to take adventurous trips. They were willing to prepay the expenses and purchase the person's travel diary as material for news from different places. However, after she told them about this plan, she also received a disappointment! They said, "This attempt is too difficult, I'm afraid it won't be successful, right?" So, based on their assumption that (probably) it wouldn't be successful, she had no choice but to withdraw with a sad face. The result of several trips turned out to be ineffective. It was really the biggest stimulus in her life.</p>
<p>Departure and Return</p>
<p>Finally, the last chance came. With the help of her father and friends, she raised three thousand gold dollars to buy an airplane. So, she left her stable clerical life and ventured into the dangers of long-distance flight.</p>
<p>The plane was very incomplete because of its low price. There was only one engine in the plane, and there was no radio. Moreover, the route to Australia was one of the most terrible air routes in the world, and no one with professional skills had ever flown it. However, she quietly took the plane alone to Australia on May 5. There, she only knew one Australian woman, who was introduced by someone. However, she spent 19 days and arrived at her destination on May 24. She was so happy! On the day of her return, the London news reporters came to apologize to her, and pretended not to know the news of her departure, in order to obtain the record of her trip. One of the newspapers, the Daily Mail, suddenly wired her 50,000 gold dollars to congratulate her on her victory. In short, on the day of her return, people had exhausted their respect and etiquette for her.</p>

<h3>Commercial News</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 16th) was the Lunar Dragon Boat Festival, and all foreign banks, silver and money exchange houses, etc. in Shanghai were closed for the day, so there were no reports on "bid prices, exchange rates, silver dollar market, public bonds, bid yarn flowers, flour, wheat, miscellaneous grains," etc.</p>
<p>Yarn and Flowers</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Downstream Consistent</h3>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton was weak, initially due to poor news from Liverpool and profit-taking, but later rebounded due to buying by colleagues. As a result, spot prices remained unchanged, and futures rose or fell by one to three pounds. British cotton futures fell by four to five points. Indian cotton initially saw a sharp drop in market prices due to speculation selling and profit-taking, but later showed a slight rebound due to buying by Japanese merchants. As a result, Pinggar fell by five and a half rupees, Aumla fell by six and a half rupees, and Bairaichi fell by seven rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated the 15th):</p>

<h3>Securities New York Stock Market Slightly</h3>
<p>Improving New Feng Foreign Firm reports that yesterday (15th) on the New York Stock Exchange, the market turned better due to England's efforts to mediate the steel industry workers and good railway freight transportation. The forward silver market was extremely dull, as everyone believed that the silver bill would slightly curb speculation. However, silver stocks still rose. Some speculators deeply believe that the silver bill will promote the rise in silver prices, as the U.S. government's purchases will trigger foreign activity. It is expected that Shanghai and London will have large purchases. The small exchange also rose. (Bonds) U.S. public bonds fell slightly, domestic bonds rose, and foreign bonds were weak. Miscellaneous grains rose due to news of foreign harvests being favorable to the longs. According to the report from our bank's New York agent, (securities) the market supply is scarce, dull but strong. It is expected that railroad stocks and utility stocks will continue to rise. (Wheat) The market has no speculative leaders, trading is sluggish, the news is good, and corn continues to be damaged. At the current price, it is not advisable to short. There has been rainfall in several wheat-producing areas, and the weather is predicted to be generally clear. (Cotton) It fell initially because the weather was expected to be good during the day, but rebounded later because there was hope of saving the steel industry labor unrest. The appetite of colleagues is slightly better, and the market supply is not large. Factory purchases this week totaled 186,000 bales. According to a telegram from Mr. Morgan from New Orleans, the cotton crop in the fields is progressing smoothly, and the rainfall in the east is not excessive. (Rubber) The appetite of colleagues is still good, the market is stable and firm, and sellers are quite cautious. The total turnover for the day was 730,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left:</p>

<h3>Silk and Tea Zhejiang Silk Cocoons Collected 100,000 Dan</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Silk Improvement Association has worked hard this year to improve silk, issuing a total of 60,000 improved seed papers. The results are excellent, and the new cocoons are abundant. Calculating an average yield of 30 kilograms of cocoons per paper, the total output of fresh cocoons is 180,000 dan. There are a total of 321 registered cocoon firms this year, and 150 firms have been approved to collect cocoons, collecting approximately 100,000 dan of fresh cocoons. Farmers who dry their own cocoons and reel their own native silk account for approximately 80,000 dan. Cocoon prices are not high, and farmers and silkworms alike have difficulty making a profit.</p>
<h3>Reduced Exports of Waste Silk to England and Japan</h3>
<p>China's yellow and white silk heads (collectively referred to as "waste silk" by customs) are becoming increasingly degenerate in English sales due to the impact of artificial silk and Japanese silk waste. Exports are decreasing. This time, only Anli and others exported 43 pieces of long silk floss and hand-drawn silk cocoons to Bombay on the English ship.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Municipal Government Decides to Hold Autumn Silkworm Meeting</h3>
<p>The Hangzhou Municipal Silkworm Management Committee will hold its 13th Silkworm Meeting at the Municipal Government at 3 PM on the 18th to discuss the spring silkworm breeding and cocoon collection matters in Hangzhou City, which have ended. The silkworm species required for the autumn period this year should be purchased as soon as possible. With the immediate approach of the autumn period, a special letter was sent to the silkworm seed manufacturing farms and silkworm improvement farms in Hangzhou City to discuss the progress of purchasing and the seed price. The meeting will report on the spring silkworm results and discuss the progress of the autumn silkworm and seed setting matters.</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Tea Continues to Arrive 6,000+ Boxes</h3>
<p>3,000+ boxes exported to England This year's Jiangxi tea harvest is still good and now being shipped to Shanghai in succession. Yesterday the Jardine Matheson Company's Ruihe Wheel also brought 6,600+ boxes. Hankou foreign tea houses also arrived with 2,000+ boxes. Today the Blue Funnel Line's Agamemnon wheel is carrying 3,000+ boxes of tea to London.</p>
<h3>Tea Market on Dragon Boat Festival</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the Lunar Dragon Boat Festival and it was also a Saturday. Foreign firms were only open for half a day. Transactions of foreign firm red and green teas were therefore slightly quieter. The entire market bought a total of 2,100+ boxes of Zhenmei, Zhenmei Needle and other green teas from Luzhuang and Tuzhuang, as well as Qimen black tea, from Jardine Matheson, Xiehe, China Tea, Tianyu and other firms. Sales prices were generally unchanged from the past few days. However, it is observed that the attitude of European firms towards purchasing is still strong, and the prospects for the tea market are expected to continue to develop.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Market Conditions After the Decline in White Tung Oil Prices</h3>
<p>The white tung oil market relies entirely on export trade. Two weeks ago, foreign firms in Hankou aggressively procured the oil, driving the price up to 30.04 yuan, a level unseen in the past two to three years, causing considerable excitement. Unexpectedly, foreign firms halted their purchases upon seeing the soaring prices, causing the market to fall into a state of stagnation. The foreign firms in Hankou, not lacking demand, are waiting for prices to fall further before resuming purchases. This standoff has lasted for two weeks, forcing traders to lower prices slightly to facilitate exports. According to news from Hankou yesterday and the day before, the price has fallen to 29 yuan, but only a small quantity is available at this price. For larger transactions, prices must still be increased, as the supply is limited and producers are holding firm. Even if foreign firms do not buy, they are unwilling to sell too cheaply. Therefore, although the market appears to have fallen in price, the underlying fundamentals remain solid. Overall, due to limited production this year, it is not easy for the market to relax. Hankou firms are offering 25 yuan plus for goods from Xiangyang and Tongbai, while southern branches are also offering around 25 yuan. Local firms in this city do not have large inventories, and domestic sales have not been active, so they have not made large purchases. However, it is rumored that a certain bean and rice firm, which also deals with foreign firms, has been selling a fixed amount but has not replenished its stock. Seeing that the Hankou market is slightly weak, they are slowly buying to replenish. Zhejiang tung oil has also seen a slight decline, currently offered at 26 yuan per dan delivered to Shanghai, but transactions are limited.</p>
<h3>Metals: Sluggish Metal Trading During the Dragon Boat Festival</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the Dragon Boat Festival according to the lunar calendar. Due to the settling of accounts in various metal businesses, trading was particularly slow. As a result, the market situation was extremely quiet, and even small business for factories was bleak. Consequently, there were no major fluctuations in metal prices.</p>
<p>Looking at the metal market situation over the past month, metal goods in January and February were still fairly satisfactory, and some people made profits. In March, the trend was flat, and in April, due to changes in foreign exchange rates, market prices fluctuated, causing many in the industry to suffer losses. In terms of business, the initial progress was good, but then gradually weakened, and in the most recent month, the atmosphere was even more subdued. This is due to the bankruptcy of rural areas, leading to a generally sluggish atmosphere in the entire market. Credit is tight, and customer groups and factories lack the capital to purchase goods, resulting in a severely deteriorating situation throughout the market. According to industry insiders, there is little hope of a turnaround in the market situation after the festival due to the precarious environment. Therefore, those in this business are quite pessimistic.</p>
<h3>Further Discussion on Abolishing Next-Day Cash Settlement for Transfers</h3>
<p>— Pan Hengqin</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>Before I begin writing, there are two points I must clarify to the readers. First, the matter of abolishing next-day cash settlement for remittances is the second step of my opinion on the overall financial construction of our country (the first step, as seen earlier, is advocating for the abolishment of the tael system and its replacement with the yuan). This is originally a kind of objective study of my own, and not just an empty reform, to be a mouthpiece for people, or to have any role or background among them. Secondly, the next-day cash settlement for remittances is to be considered one matter, and the period of January 28th when only remittances were allowed and cash withdrawals were not allowed is another matter. The boundaries are clear and not intertwined. Only when these are understood, please read what I write below.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>The discussion of abolishing next-day cash settlement for remittances was not originally initiated by me. Just like the saying that the previous generation had already said before me regarding the unification of the currency, I am only reminding people to pay attention, and arousing attention. As far back as the time of advocating the abolishment of the tael system in the ninth year of the Republic, Mr. Xu Jiqing wrote an article called (The Abolishment of the Tael System Should Start with Abolishing Remittance Silver), published in the Bank Weekly. My writing advocating this reform was after the Ministry of Finance ordered the implementation of the abolishment of the tael system last year. The reason why I did not advocate abolishing next-day cash settlement for remittances at the same time as implementing the abolishment of the tael system was actually for the sake of a part of the financial industry. I knew the inside story, and I didn’t want to act rashly, so I added a lot of unnecessary twists and turns. In January of this year, Mr. Ma Yinchu published an article in the Shenbao Monthly called (The Shortcomings of China's Financial System and its Reform Plan). The section on unifying the currency deeply rejoiced and coincided with my humble opinion. Recently, I heard that Hangzhou was planning to cancel the foreign remittance of cash on June 1st, so I continued to draft a few articles, publish them in the newspaper, in order to reform in time. I am afraid that the view is too narrow, and it is difficult to be elegant, and the original text is brief, and it is inevitable that it will cause unnecessary repercussions from some people, and confuse hearing, so I will re-explain in a rambling way. If the reader does not think that his words are light, and then teach it, then it is a great fortune.</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>The remittance system of the money industry is originally equal to the exchange system of the bank, which can save currency. I agree with it, how can I express dissatisfaction? What I want to put forward for research, but I cannot stop myself from saying, is that in the money industry, remittances can be collected on the same day between colleagues, but for banks and non-colleagues, cash must be collected the next day. This kind of next-day cash collection method has been used for a long time, and it cannot be said that it has no considerable value in history. In the past silver era, the procedures for entering and exiting were very complicated, often unable to be collected and resolved on the same day, so for those who received money outside the industry, it had to be solved on the next day. This is one thing. Also, in the beginning of the mutual market between China and foreign countries, the financial industry of the country was not sufficient, and the chips were lacking, and the next-day cash collection allowed preparation and allocation, and could have one more day of hesitation. This is the second thing. However, the market situation today is very different from the past. Since September 18th, cash has been concentrated in the city, and the silver and money industry chips have been slack and abused to the extreme. According to the recent survey, on May 17th of this year, the silver dollar reserves in Shanghai were 353.93 million yuan, of which Chinese banks accounted for 26.73 million yuan. And the credit of soft currency is solid, and the circulation is increasing, and there is no worry that the chips are insufficient, and the silver has been abolished, and there is only one kind of silver dollar, no matter soft currency or hard currency, there is no reason why it cannot be collected and solved on the same day. Then the remittance collection and settlement of the money industry can be reformed in time, and why should the next-day cash collection be used for banks and non-colleagues?</p>
<p>(IV)</p>
<p>Some people say that the reason why the money industry's remittances to banks and non-colleagues must be settled the next day is that foreign banks have the ambition to monopolize Shanghai's finance, and are not bound by the money house's remittance system. They must withdraw cash and put it into their own silver vaults, so they specifically stipulate next-day cash payment to show restrictions. The so-called remittance system is the only defense line for the Chinese financial industry to resist foreign economic aggression, so as to break the dream of monopolizing finance. This statement is plausible, but I know that even a three-foot child will laugh. Since next-day cash settlement is set up to resist foreign businesses, why should next-day cash settlement also be applied to domestic banks and non-colleagues? And for decades, what has been the achievement of resisting foreign monopoly finance by asking for next-day cash settlement? Since you can stipulate next-day cash payment, why not stipulate several periods of time to resist it? On the surface, next-day cash payment seems to be a loss to foreign businesses, but how can you know that foreign businesses have secretly added the losses of next-day cash payment to the price or cost of goods, and it is still Chinese businesses outside the money industry who suffer the loss? The economic aggression of the powers in China, monopolizing finance, is truly meticulous. If our country does not establish banks in time, adopt appropriate systems, and issue banknotes, then it can be known that foreign banknotes will flood the country to this day. The money industry is worried about the country, and I have always admired it. It is a pity that it was not able to cut off contact with those who traded directly or indirectly under economic aggression at that time, otherwise, even if the politics is not on track, I know that its harvest is better than using the method of next-day cash settlement for remittances, and empty words to resist, how can it be the same day?</p>
<p>(V)</p>
<p>I have heard people who advocate next-day cash settlement for remittances say that next-day cash settlement for banks and non-colleagues is beneficial to finance and does not harm all sectors. This is also not the truth. In general, for customers, there are indeed remittance notes and non-remittance notes in recent deposits and withdrawals. There are also bills that are deposited in cash and used to open notes, but they cannot be cashed on the same day. If you need to cash them, you must either fill in the date one day earlier, or you must wait one day before you can cash them. This is to cause the customer to lose one day of interest for no reason. Also, such as goods transaction, one party purchases raw materials, must bring cash to foreign ports, and one party sells goods, the revenue obtained, for the day's remittance ticket, the remittance ticket must be cashed the next day, if you want to discount to pay, it will inevitably cause the customer to lose one day's interest. As for foreign firms, if they do not hand over the remittance notes they receive to foreign banks, but establish business relations with Chinese banks, it is precisely because the foreign firms have the remittance payment head, and are not willing to lose money, and bear the risk. Why is it enough to say to protect sovereignty? Furthermore, from the perspective of Chinese banks, in general, Chinese banks have to use remittances for the convenience of customers' receipts and payments. If remittances are not used, and the head is used as the standard, then if a customer pays in a remittance note, it will inevitably delay the account for one day, making the customer dissatisfied. Although the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications have implemented cash collection and cash settlement one after another since May 1, 1917 and April 1, 1932, each of the local offices established by the two banks in recent years has also used remittances for entry and exit. However, Chinese banks cannot handle remittances in the remittance association of the money industry. Except for a part of the notes of the exchange bank that can be offset in the exchange, the rest of the large part of the remittance notes must be entrusted to the money house to collect and pay. In recent years, the number of banks has increased, and the number of money houses has decreased. The number of remittances collected and paid by banks is very large. Usually, the deposits of banks and money houses are inevitably controlled by others, and the risk is worrying when the market is tight. Is this the blessing of the financial industry? Now, from the perspective of the money house, the money house uses the method of next-day cash settlement for remittances. When the market needs cash, it raises the head and adds water. On the contrary, it removes water. On the one hand, it also makes the bank's remittance entry and exit have to go through the money house to absorb the bank's head. As mentioned above, in terms of the local money house, it is indeed profitable and harmless. However, recently, the market is full of floating capital. Some money houses do not welcome the deposits of banks because they have to bear the risks and pay interest. The situation is different now and then. Everything is responsible for adapting to the times. This is why I attach great importance to reform in time, so as to achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>

<p>Moreover, I have something to say. My proposal to abolish the next-day cash for remittances is to promote the financial industry, and seek the cooperation of the whole. It is precisely to aspire to be strong, so that foreign banks have no foothold in China. If the self-system is different, and the habits are repeated, how can we expect the foreign banks to abide by the laws and regulations of the government? The most alarming thing now is that abolishing the next-day cash for remittances may even lead to the exhaustion of cash and the collapse of finance. Some people also say that the remittance transfer system can cope with extraordinary situations, taking the January 28th era as a proof, and using the fact that the two banks in the middle of the transaction also used interbank remittance for the payment of telegraphic transfer bills as an excuse. However, it is not known that the cash collection of the same day of remittance, the current collection of the next day, in the money industry is only one day of the head, how can the cash be exhausted and the finance collapse? The remittance situation in the January 28th era was not the next-day cash collection, but only remittance was allowed and cash collection was not allowed. The facts are different. And at that time, if it was not (1) the three banks in the middle of the transaction that lent huge amounts of money, (2) special transactions such as rice and grain were not able to be financed with cash, (3) the people loved the domestic financial institutions, it is not known whether the difficulties could be overcome steadily. The settlement of telegraphic transfer bills by remittance in the middle of the transaction is because the other party only comes with remittance, and it is inevitable that they have to go with remittance. Why is it enough to be a disease? If the wise men of the time superstitiously allow only remittance and not cash collection, as the only way to overcome the difficulties, then in the future, the method of crossed checks can also be used, and the words "Chinese banks" or "money houses" can be filled in the cross line, so that they will not flow into the hands of foreign banks. What is the harm to abolish the next-day cash collection?</p>
<p>(VII)</p>
<p>In short, next-day cash settlement for remittances and allowing only remittances but not cash collection are two different things. Changing from a part of next-day cash settlement to a full part of the same-day cash settlement is not difficult. The method of coping with financial emergencies can be used occasionally but not often. Otherwise, no matter how you prevent and protect, you will eventually avoid the escape of funds. This can be seen from the methods of prohibiting gold exports and other methods in various countries. If it is not absolutely necessary, it will never be cited as a clear proof. To resist foreign aggression, we must start from the root, and what is more important is that financial industry must remove the obstacles to cooperation, so that we can make a film, so that the credit of Chinese banks and money houses can be improved at the same time, the vision should be far-reaching, and do not be limited to local interests. This is the trivial intention of publicizing the abolition of remittances and next-day cash collection. Success does not have to be myself, the fact is the most eloquent. As for how to implement the abolition of the next-day cash collection, I have drafted three measures: (1) The Bankers' Association of the Banking Industry shall send a letter to the member banks to the effect that the foreign remittance and the head remittance shall be used at the same time on a regular basis, and the remittance bills shall not be collected the next day, so the transaction bills shall stop using the remittance stamp. (2) The Banking Industry Association shall send a letter to the Exchange to transfer the foreign remittance accounts of the exchange banks to the head remittance accounts and record them together. (3) The Ministry of Finance shall order the Money Industry Association to pay all remittances to banks and non-colleagues on the same day on a regular basis. The new transaction bills are prohibited from being stamped with remittance stamps (if the money industry can reform automatically, such as abolishing the 25 cents before the abolishment of the tael system, it is even more appropriate). Is there anything wrong? I hope that the leaders of the financial industry and the government authorities will study together. The past events of abolishing the tael system and changing the yuan are not far away, and they can be used as a mirror. The people of the country, let's learn from it together.</p>

<h3>Apprentice Life in Europe and America</h3>
<p>— Chi</p>
<p>In the old-fashioned shops and general handicrafts of our country, the creation of a talent is not from the apprentice. Even in the general new-style shops or companies, trainees are also apprentices who have changed their names. A good talent in society is not necessarily created from school, often from hard work in apprentice life, so the apprentice system exists very firmly in society. Apprentices seem to be a unique way of learning in our country, but in fact it is not so. Foreign countries also have foreign apprentices, and in central Europe, the apprentice system is prevalent in society. Most of the people in the professional world also come from apprentices. Although he is a student from a very famous school, he is not necessarily more capable than an apprentice, and his ability to endure hardship is definitely not comparable.</p>
<p>The German Prime Minister was an apprentice of a lacquer artist. Although he was very dissatisfied with the life of a lacquer artist, a person who has been tempered in the life of an apprentice trusts that apprentices are not humble learners, so he is a character who strives to improve the life of apprentices.</p>
<p>Although there are also foreign apprentices in foreign society, the life of foreign apprentices is much better than that of apprentices in our country. However, we think that this kind of life is excellent, but they are still dissatisfied and preparing to improve it.</p>
<p>British apprentices are mostly small-scale industrial and commercial enterprises, and it is not easy to see them in large factories and shops. The apprenticeship period of these apprentices is not fixed, and it must be determined according to their ability. An apprentice in an ordinary shop can be assigned to work in about a year. Usually, each week's allowance can also get five shillings to ten shillings, which is enough to maintain life. They work about ten hours a day. As for an apprentice in a bank, they can work in a few months at the fastest. If they cannot work in a year, they must be asked to find another way. However, the apprentices in the factory are different. Their training period is at least one year. If the master thinks that he has been trained, he can find a job. However, there is no fixed limit to how many years he should study.</p>
<p>German apprentices are mostly in the industrial world, and a few are in the business world. Usually a blacksmith has two or three apprentices, and they all absolutely obey the master. Although their study period is always about two years, a person who is particularly excellent in a job can be considered to have completed his studies after a few months. There is often an apprentice who, after studying for a short time, works better than his master. This kind of character who is better than his master will be asked by his master to work with a relatively generous treatment. At that time, his position is completely a partner, and he is no longer regarded as an apprentice. Of course, an ordinary apprentice cannot have such an opportunity. It is like this in the industrial world, but it is different in the business world. There should be a few apprentices in a writing room. The income of this kind of apprentice can sometimes maintain his family life. However, this kind of apprentice, sometimes promoted to a staff member, his salary is reduced, because the income of apprentices is not specified, but the salary of staff is specified. The life of American apprentices is lower than that of European countries. Although American businesses have a lot of capital, they are very harsh on the treatment of low-level people. Therefore, the apprentices in the United States, even a trainee in a bank, only have a few cents of income per week, which is not enough for one person's bread. Invisibly, there are not many apprentices in the United States, and the result is that they are not as motivated as apprentices in European countries.</p>
<p>However, the apprentices in Europe and America are very different from those in our country. Their treatment is better than that of apprentices in our country. We hope that the society can improve the apprentice life in our country appropriately. What is more needed is to change the learning period. The current method of following the three-year study of three years must be eradicated!</p>

<h3>Rural Female Teacher</h3>
<p>— Ms. Xueyin</p>
<p>In order to avoid unemployment, I ran around for five or six days in the city's south and north during a winter of sleet and snow.  In the end, I sorrowfully carried my simple luggage and left K school, where I had just been dismissed, heading towards the distant countryside.  There was a private clan-run school there, in need of someone like me, driven by life.</p>
<p>The salary was only thirty dan of grain per semester.  My God, how much money is thirty dan of grain?  But for it, I had to sit in a long-distance sedan chair for two days, going to that poor and remote place with only mountains and fields.  This is life, this is the road of life that I painstakingly opened up in the winter, sweating all the way!</p>
<p>Embraced by two ancient cypress trees, a red-eaved, white-walled, black-doored building stood out, with the four large characters "X Clan Ancestral Hall" prominently displayed on the wall. The X Clan's private school was inside, and my home for the next half year would be there too.</p>
<p>The ancestral hall was already a relic from a hundred years ago.  The gilded carvings on the altar and stage were only faint shadows now, coupled with slogans faded by wind and rain, such as "Study Hard, Don't Forget the Revolution" and "Long Live the Three Principles of the People..."  These red and green slogans made the place even more bleak.  Although spring had begun to paint the tips of the branches with light green, my heart felt as dismal and indescribable as wearing mourning clothes.</p>
<p>The school had two classes: the elementary school and the women's vocational department. For the price of thirty dan of grain, I had to take charge of all the liberal arts subjects in the vocational department.  In addition, all the subjects in the elementary school, except for Chinese, Party Principles, and calligraphy taught by the old principal himself, were assigned to me.  As a result, I had more than five hours of classes every day, plus a large number of textbooks of various kinds to grade. Thirty dan of grain! Thirty dan of grain was going to suffocate me!</p>
<p>The principal was the only scholar in the X clan. Forty years ago, he had been a naval police student studying in Japan. But the old era was over, and the principal's past glory had also passed. What remained in him now was the same pathetic poverty as this dilapidated ancestral hall. It was said that the X clan's descendants, in order to avoid leaving the annual public funds of three hundred dan of grain unused, and unwilling to see their children not even recognize land deeds, had started this clan school. They had then "rescued the orphan" by entrusting it and the considerable funding to this lonely principal, as a way to solve his future. His wife, a female tailor from the provincial capital, served as the sewing teacher in the vocational department and also as the "director of discipline." In addition, they lacked an assistant who needed to be "all-encompassing," so they hired me at the price of thirty dan of grain per semester to come there.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, it was easy to imagine the trouble and effort involved in being a rural teacher.</p>
<p>School started, and the students were sent to school by their parents one after another. The children, dragging their snotty noses, ran and shouted in the yard, like crazy little calves. The female students in the vocational department were completely different. Thick braids hung down their backs under their vests, and large trouser legs covered their fat thighs, talking and laughing proudly and happily. When the principal pointed at me and said to them, "Come and greet her quickly, this is your teacher!" they blushed and ran away as if they had met a strange man.</p>
<p>"What if they run off somewhere when I'm teaching?" I thought, and laughed.</p>
<p>I took the chalk and stepped onto the platform for those simple rural girls. Quietly, their faces were all lowered, and their hands were straight on their laps. The echoes when I called the roll could only be heard by pricking up one's ears. To liven up the atmosphere, I had no choice but to put aside the textbooks and, relying on what I had in my head, talk about various aspects of women's issues related to them, hoping to provoke them to ask questions or even discuss, but the result was a failure. They remained quiet, and no one even raised their head. The bell rang, and I coldly stepped down from the platform. Just as one foot went out the door, a burst of laughter suddenly erupted in the classroom. I stood there dumbfounded like a wooden chicken.</p>
<p>Going from the vocational department classroom to the elementary school classroom was like running from a temple into a theater.</p>
<p>The children clamored, sitting crookedly in their seats, spitting, arguing, the young ones crying, the old ones laughing. They wouldn't be quiet until you, like a teacher in a private school, picked up the "ruler" and slapped it loudly. But after a while, they would shout again: "Teacher, he stole my stone pencil!" "Teacher, my inkstone is gone."</p>
<p>The classroom had only thirty or so people, but they were divided into three classes. The youngest were only four years old, and the oldest were already strong young farmers. In one hour, I had to teach three different lessons. The vocational department was the same. Sixteen students were divided into three classes, and one class had only two people, but I still had to teach the lesson from beginning to end to those two people. After three o'clock in the afternoon, piles of textbooks piled up on the desk: nearly sixty essays (the principal's eyes were old and couldn't see clearly, so I also graded the elementary school students' essays) and nearly sixty arithmetic books, plus all kinds of notebooks, large and small character copies... You had no way to sort these things out until late at night when everyone was quiet.</p>
<p>In this way, I lived the same routine every day: eating, teaching, grading textbooks; no newspapers to read, no letters from friends; watching the children shout and jump like wild bulls in the yard, the female students hiding upstairs, shyly whispering... Letting life flow away like a muddy river in this simple and turbid air, I didn't know the world outside the ancestral hall, and the people outside the ancestral hall had forgotten me too. The spring sun smiled happily, and the soil in the fields under its embrace became loose and soft. The small grass on the bank of the pond was dyed a bright green, and the stream climbed actively in the mountain stream. The ridges of the fields were full of footprints of people and cattle, it was time to transplant rice seedlings.</p>
<p>In the noisy children's classroom, the number of people suddenly decreased, and the female students also asked for leave to go home one after another. "What exactly is going on?" I asked the principal. "Going home to help transplant rice seedlings," the principal replied nonchalantly.</p>
<p>"Why doesn't the school officially post a notice for vacation?"</p>
<p>"There's no need to post a notice. Anyway, in the countryside, it's the school that accommodates the students, not the students that accommodate the school. If we were too strict, no one would come. Being more casual is easier for everyone." The principal shook his head and said casually, carrying his fishing rod and walking towards the pond, looking indeed leisurely and content.</p>
<p>I took a few days off in this "leisurely and uneventful" period.</p>
<p>The rice seedlings sprouted green in the paddy fields, and the students returned to school, but they were much wilder, and they often had to go home early on their own because, during "busy farming" season, studying was less important than everything else. The female students, however, stayed at school more, and the air in the classroom was much more lively than before. They no longer lowered their heads when they saw me, and gradually became close to me. Looking at their thick braids hanging straight in the center of their backs, I felt clumsy all over. I had advised them to cut them off several times, but they hadn't accepted. But the last time, the youngest girl bravely said to me: "Then, please cut them for me, teacher!" Starting with that one, within a week, all sixteen girls, like warriors going to the battlefield, sacrificed their beautiful hair under my scissors. The principal, who had been sitting by the pond fishing, had suddenly become busy recently. He told me: the inspectors were coming. From early morning until late at night, he personally supervised the cook and handyman to clean the school (no, the ancestral hall) thoroughly, bought some red and green paper to write "Welcome" slogans, and tore off those faded ones. He called all the students in as if he were issuing a general mobilization order, dressed them in new clothes, and made them sit neatly in the classroom without moving. At the same time, he also hired many wild children from outside to fill the empty seats. In the vocational department classroom, he added several temporarily rented sewing machines and hired even more students, almost exceeding the original number.</p>
<p>After the principal's busy preparations for several days, the inspectors were carried to the school in a three-person sedan chair like deities. The attendants (figures such as principals and school board members invited from other nearby elementary schools) greeted them from the front gate. A lavish feast of fish and meat was set up in the altar hall as a welcome reception. After the meal, the inspectors, "escorted" by the principal, "visited" each classroom for a while, and left with a smile in the original sedan chair.</p>
<p>"Finally got through it, let's see if we can get a first-class 'subsidy'..." The principal sighed in relief, as if a burden had been lifted, then took his fishing rod from behind the door again, and the atmosphere in the school suddenly relaxed again. When the children couldn't find the principal during "Chinese" class, they dragged out the "Three Character Classic," "Miscellaneous Characters," and other "easy-to-recite books" that they had read at home when they were "beginning learning," and began to read them rhythmically as if singing.</p>
<p>In the fiery sun, the school quietly closed for vacation, and the students scattered like forest birds. I took four whole months' salary, sixty dollars exchanged for thirty dan of grain, and set off again on another path in life.</p>
<h3>Fascists and the Chinese National Liberation Movement</h3>
<p>— Zhi Shi</p>
<p>The fate of the Chinese nation has become extremely miserable; the position of the Chinese nation is on the verge of slavery. If we do not rise up to resist, there is only one way to die! Undoubtedly, the national liberation movement has become an urgent requirement of the entire Chinese nation.</p>
<p>But how should we carry out our national liberation movement?</p>
<p>We must have the responsible and hard-working spirit of the fascists! And the strong and iron-fisted policies of the fascists!</p>
<p>What is the spirit of responsible hard work? Mussolini said it well: "Our program is very simple: we want to rule Italy! As for 'programs,' there are many! Italy does not lack programs for happiness, Italy lacks people who do things and the will to do things!… Fascism now wants to put the burden of Italy's 47 million people on its own shoulders and bear the most terrible responsibility!" Mr. Mo also said: "Fascism is not a political program of a party, it is a movement. It does not need to create a long-term program to be realized, it is just building the system that it wants to do to liberate Italy day by day!" That is to say, do not indulge in empty talk when encountering things, but only seek to implement them, do not know how to shirk responsibility, and come forward to take responsibility yourself. With this spirit of responsible hard work, the movement for national liberation can begin!</p>
<p>However, the spirit of responsible hard work of the fascists is not the spirit of personal autocracy of Louis XIV, who said "I am the state," nor is it the spirit of the nihilistic party's "individual freedom and direct action" in the early period of the Russian Revolution! The spirit of responsible hard work of the fascists is the spirit of national unity, organization, and discipline! What is the spirit of national unity? This means that an entire nation, whether it is the bourgeoisie, the petty bourgeoisie, or the proletariat, is united under the common will to resolutely oppose imperialism and strive for national liberation, and jointly carries out a powerful struggle. The leader of the French fascists, Valois, said in his book National Revolution: "The national revolution is a revolution of the whole. It is not a sum of reforms, it is to overthrow the bourgeois, free, democratic, and representative system of the state. It does not stand on the position of the right-wing bourgeois party, nor does it stand on the position of the left-wing socialist party. They stand above all classes and parties, they are the party of the entire nation (the original text is the entire France), including all kinds of people." Mr. Valois also said in the preface to the fascist revolution record written by Gaoer Geli Ni: "In fact, fascism is the work of intellectuals, soldiers, and the masses of workers and peasants united in a common movement against the despicable actions of the democratic bourgeoisie, and it can also be said to be a resistance to the free bourgeois government that is making Italy increasingly weak." He also said: "...How is this militia (referring to the Italian fascist militia) organized? Initially, it was formed by soldiers, students, artists, employees, workers, and peasants who participated in the European War; if you examine the political origins of these members, it includes royalists, republicans, socialists,... Strictly speaking, this is a group of organized outstanding elements, this is a group standing above all spirits, this is the soul of the new Italy, the fighting Italy..." Therefore, we know that national unity is the basic element of all fascist actions.</p>
<p>What is the spirit of organization and discipline? This means concentrating the scattered forces in the nation into a collective force; concentrating the scattered soldiers fighting individually into combat groups with commands, orders, and formations. The so-called organization is to gather many scattered individuals to form an organic and unified whole; each individual is a part of this unified whole, and this unified whole is the sum of each individual. The more the power of the organization expands, the more progressively it increases its power, until a qualitative change occurs. The so-called discipline is absolute obedience. Obeying the beliefs of the group, obeying the leadership of the group and the orders of the organization, is like the army obeying the orders of its officers in wartime. This discipline is the element of any combat group, and without this discipline, no action can be effective.</p>
<p>After the organization and discipline of the national group are in place, we must begin to implement various necessary strong policies. Taking the Italian fascists as an example, and referring to the special circumstances of China, at a minimum, the following three major strong policies should be implemented:</p>
<p>(1) Strong diplomatic policy. Imperialists invade the Chinese nation, and their tools are political and economic power: political power is the military force of the army, navy, and air force; economic power is commodity aggression and investment. If we want to resist them, we can only use the "force" method. If they threaten us with military force, we will counter them with military force; if they invade us with economic force, we will resist them with economic force. We will never allow the sovereignty and territory of China to be lost in the slightest; we will never allow the interests of the Chinese nation to be sacrificed in the slightest. We must prepare for long-term resistance, prepare our strength, and use our strength to thoroughly resist the invasion of any imperialist, that is our strong diplomatic policy!</p>
<p>(2) Strong economic policy. On the one hand, we must resist the invasion of the imperialists, and on the other hand, we must solve the people's livelihood problems in order to achieve the practical unity of the nation. It is imperative that the government implement a planned and ruled economy! Judging from the current special situation in our country, the two major methods of restricting capital and equalizing land ownership in the Principle of People's Livelihood should be effectively implemented, and the construction of state capital should be realized. We can ignore all the restraints of the imperialists and the opposition of domestic capitalists and landlords. Adopting this principle and formulating a planned ruled economy is the economic policy that the Chinese nation urgently needs!</p>
<p>(3) Strong central dictatorial policy. Spurious democratic politics have indeed played a considerable role in capitalist countries; but in today's increasingly acute class struggle, democratic politics have lost their ruling role. China is not a capitalist country, but a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country. On the one hand, it needs to train the political power of the people, and on the other hand, it needs to implement strong diplomatic and economic policies. In order to eliminate the resistance of comprador capitalists and landlords, and to unify the command of national power, a centralized dictatorial policy should be implemented. This dictatorship is an unavoidable process in the national liberation movement rather than a long-term political system, so it can only be called a policy.</p>
<p>We believe that the Chinese nation will be able to achieve complete liberation and freedom under the efforts of this organized and disciplined combat group that implements strong policies.</p>

<h3>The Soviet Union's Musical Instrument Industry</h3>
<p>— Jun Shi</p>
<p>The production of musical instruments is a branch of Soviet industry, which only began to be noticed between 1924 and 1925.</p>
<p>The establishment of the foundation of this new industry will be one of the goals of the Second Five-Year Plan. However, in the First Five-Year Plan, the improvement in the quality and increase in the quantity of musical instruments have greatly exceeded the pre-war records in this regard.</p>
<p>Following the progress of the First Five-Year Plan, the output value of large-scale production in musical instrument factories and small-scale production in handicraft workshops has increased from 10 million rubles in 1928 to 70 million rubles in 1932. During those five years, excluding privately run businesses, the output value of state-run musical instrument production alone was as high as 91 million rubles. Before the revolution, most of the musical instruments used in old Russia were imported from foreign countries in the form of raw materials or semi-finished products. At that time, the operation of the few musical instrument industries was entirely in the hands of foreign capitalists and specialists. The musical instrument factories within the territory of old Russia were all controlled by foreign specialists, and Russian workers had no way of knowing the detailed manufacturing process of musical instruments. They were only hired for the two tasks of transporting raw materials purchased from foreign countries and assembling parts.</p>
<p>Although certain musical instruments, such as zithers and accordions, could be manufactured by old Russia itself, most musical instruments still had to rely on foreign imports.</p>
<p>Now, the Soviet Union no longer needs to rely on foreign goods in this regard. The manufacturing techniques of various musical instruments, such as organs, pianos, phonographs, phonograph records, violins... have all been mastered by Soviet musical instrument workers. The raw materials, semi-finished materials, and parts for musical instruments, which were imported from foreign countries not long ago, have now been completely replaced by domestic goods.</p>
<p>The following is a list of the quantity of musical instrument production at the end of the First Five-Year Plan:</p>
<p>Pianos·········4,500 pieces Organs········62,200 pieces Stringed instruments, such as guitars, mandolins, balalaikas, violins, etc.······ 1,038,300 pieces</p>
<p>Accordions···200,000 pieces Phonographs····322,000 pieces Phonograph records 4,540,000 pieces There is no doubt that the large demand for musical instruments is the result of the improvement of the cultural level and living environment of the working people.</p>
<p>The replacement of manual production with mechanical production in the musical instrument industry has made significant progress in the past few years. This makes it possible to greatly increase the production quantity of musical instruments and reduce the price to a minimum. Now, the manufacturing of major musical instruments, especially phonographs, is completely mechanized.</p>
<p>Also worth mentioning is that not long ago a musical instrument factory was built in Krumna, which is scheduled to manufacture 500,000 phonographs there every year. A new factory specializing in the manufacture of stringed instruments (such as violins, cellos, contrabasses, etc.) will also be completed soon. The supply of new raw materials for the musical instrument industry is also being studied and experimented with. This makes the operation of musical instruments slightly localized: some republics are particularly focused on certain aspects. For example, Georgia is particularly focused on establishing large manufacturing factories for pianos and ethnic musical instruments. Ukraine has a musical instrument trust that focuses solely on the planned production of pianos, organs, accordions, and simpler stringed instruments, etc.</p>
<p>In order to avoid the shortcomings in musical instrument manufacturing science and experimentation, a musical instrument technology research institute has been successfully established under the leadership of Professor Andreev, a famous physicist and acoustician. This research institute is closely monitoring the production of various musical instruments. In addition, various musical instrument manufacturing agencies have also established their experimental laboratories.</p>
<p>Replacing the lack of musical instrument manufacturing technical training schools before the revolution, the Soviet Union has now opened many factory apprentice schools to train musical instrument workers. Musical instrument manufacturing specialists are growing in large numbers.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, in the Soviet Union's Second Five-Year Plan, the musical instrument industry will be a branch of the inevitable high-speed development of light industry, because the unlimited possibilities in this regard have been foreshadowed to us.</p>

<h3>Can England and America Unite Against Japan?</h3>
<p>— Senran</p>
<p>In the Chinese market, it goes without saying that the conflict between England, Japan, and America is the most direct and acute. Therefore, as Japan continuously invades China, some diplomatic experts say that we should unite with England and America to restrain Japan. If England and America can unite against Japan, then our recovery of lost territories in the Northeast, the abolition of all unequal treaties between China and Japan, and even the complete liberation of the Chinese nation would not be a problem. In reality, under the current circumstances, whether England and America can truly unite against Japan is still a big question.</p>
<p>Since the European War, the development of American financial capitalism has already posed a great threat to the British Empire. In Canada, in the South Seas Islands, and in the Indian market, the economic power of the "gold dollar kingdom" is growing daily, with a tendency to expel British forces and replace them. As for the shift of the world economic center from London to New York, the equality of Anglo-American naval ratios, and the encroachment on the British Empire's maritime hegemony, these are even more manifestations of the decline of British power and the rise of American arrogance after the war. Under these circumstances, the aging Britain is naturally struggling desperately to try to restore its world hegemony. Thus, the Anglo-American rivalry has become a major aspect of the current world situation.</p>
<p>In order to eliminate its declining trend and restore its world hegemony, Britain has to use most of its strength to deal with America. Naturally, Japan's excessive actions in the Far East are also displeasing to London, but in the mutual conflicts of international imperialism, the contradictions between England and America are, in any case, greater than those between England and Japan. Taking the current situation in China as an example, although Japan's ambition to dominate East Asia has been completely exposed, its current actions are mainly in North China, while Britain's sphere of influence in China is in South China and the Yangtze River basin. Therefore, in reality, the conflict between England and Japan</p>
<p>is still not very direct in comparison. At the same time, on the other hand, America's power in South China and the Yangtze River basin is expanding fiercely, becoming a direct conflict with Britain in China. Therefore, Britain not only does not unite with America to restrain Japan, but, in certain situations, even wants to pull Japan in to deal with America. The pro-Japanese attitude shown by London after the (September 18th Incident), and the recent public acknowledgment by British Foreign Secretary Simon of Japan's (special rights) in China, are clear expressions of the British Empire's attitude.</p>
<p>As for America, it is currently waging a tariff war and a currency war with Britain to compete for the world market, so it certainly</p>
<p>cannot be said to be engaging in friendly relations with London to deal with Japan. Therefore, although Japan's recent aggressive actions against China have threatened American interests, on the New York side, besides repeatedly reciting the Nine-Power Treaty, it can only (swallow its anger) and do nothing; there is no concrete plan to unite with Britain to restrain Japan.</p>
<p>From this, it seems that the matter of England and America uniting against Japan is impossible, at least under the current circumstances.</p>
<p>The inability of England and America to unite against Japan is, of course, a good opportunity for Japan to actively invade China. The British Labour Party's newspaper, Darly Herald, made the following comment on this:</p>
<p>"The Japanese government is often able to seize opportunities quickly in the Far East by taking advantage of situations of conflict. Japan's recent activity is due to other countries being too busy or unwilling to get involved. ... Japan's recent demands are a great leap forward in turning China into a Japanese protectorate. This is a blatant attack on China's political independence, which not only the Nine-Power Treaty has guaranteed, but also other League of Nations countries have sworn to maintain. But what's the use? France's stubbornness is that the League of Nations is used to deal with Germany, while Foreign Secretary Simon still believes that aggression against China is Japan's historical mission. ......"</p>
<p>The more intense the conflicts between the great powers, especially England and America, the more beneficial it is to Japan's aggression against China. Japan's recent pressure on us to recognize the Twenty-One Demands, recognize the Nishihara Loans, resolve all past pending cases of Japanese aggression against China, and implement transportation and postal services with "Manchukuo," are manifestations of its desire to quickly annex China and dominate East Asia in a situation where the great powers are preoccupied with Europe and Anglo-American conflicts are developing.</p>
<p>In this way, if we want England and America to unite against Japan in order to obtain China's independence, then I am afraid that before this wish is realized, China will have already perished!</p>
<p>Moreover, to be honest, even if England and America could truly unite, drive Japan out of China, even flatten Tokyo, and subdue the island nation, || even so, if we ourselves are still so incompetent, then I am afraid that we cannot avoid the fate of being slaves of a conquered nation.</p>
<p>Naturally, in diplomacy, we can use the conflicts between imperialists to seek our own independence and liberation, but mainly, we still need to make ourselves worthy; if we are always sleeping like this and not moving, then even if the conflicts between imperialists are more acute, even if England, Japan, and America fight every day in the Pacific, there is no way to help us; moreover, aren't the conflicts between imperialists such as England, Japan, and America for the purpose of seizing our interests?</p>

<h3>Ms. Stein, a Woman on the Scientific Front</h3>
<p>— Wenyuan</p>
<p>Ms. Stein, an internationally renowned physiologist and former director of the Physiological Chemistry Department of the University of Geneva, is now the director of the Institute of Physiological Sciences in Moscow, Russia. This scientific research institute is intended to cultivate a new force of female directors and instructors for scientific research institutes. Stein's scientific workers (i.e., scientific researchers) and graduates are mostly women. Stein feels that women are not as enthusiastic in the scientific field as they are in other fields, so she is determined to help ordinary women participate in the scientific front.</p>
<p>Ms. Stein has a lively and strong personality. In her office, she handles all academic and organizational issues with precision. From her appearance, it can be seen that she has 31 years of experience in academic and teaching work, but she still looks young and energetic.</p>
<p>Ms. Stein has set the work of her research institute to a broad standard, thus correcting the incorrect traditional view that all fighting women are inherently narrow-minded (i.e., incompetent). Because she is a member of nine international academic groups, she often accommodates foreign scientists to engage in scientific exploration under her guidance. There are currently four foreigners working in the research institute.</p>
<p>In 1929, she attended a scientific conference in Boston and stayed in the United States for two months. She felt that there were some similarities between Americans and Russians because these two countries are the largest countries in the world. She has presented written reports at international physiology conferences held in Rome, Boston, and Milan. She has presented many papers in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Belgium. Her research on oxidation and the physiological barriers between blood flow and the brain has won international acclaim. She has published more than two hundred scientific works in foreign and Russian magazines.</p>
<p>The Institute of Physiological Sciences is currently conducting experiments on the naturalness of sleep and the results of the center of the nervous system's desire to sleep. Another group is studying the results of biological smoking. Ms. Stein is very proficient in these educational and practical issues, because this is what she started learning 31 years ago. Although she was born in Russia, she abandoned her family and went to the University of Geneva to study medicine. Her scientific talent was discovered when she was still a student. She was the first woman to enter the laboratory of Professor Purivas de Tourlin, a famous physiologist in Geneva. In 1902, she completed her studies in endocrinology and received her doctoral degree the following year. In 1904, she served as an assistant teacher at the Institute of Physiology at the University of Geneva. Because of the excellence of her doctoral thesis, she also received a certificate of merit.</p>
<p>Her academic progress is constantly advancing. Every few years, it can be seen that she not only has new contributions in the field of physiology, but also has obtained new positions that women had not yet occupied until then. In 1906, she gave a special lecture on physiological chemistry for the first time. In 1917, a special lectureship in physiological chemistry was established specifically for her.</p>
<p>When she was in Geneva, although she had close relations with revolutionary groups living abroad, she did not join any revolutionary political parties. It was not until the arrival of the October Revolution and the basic victory of socialist construction that she felt that her career should be integrated with scientific and socialist construction, and that research opportunities and observations should be developed in the Soviet Union, which was built on a new social perspective.</p>
<p>In 1925, a letter of appointment was sent from the Second Academy of Moscow University, and she resigned from her position in Geneva and took up the position of professor of physiology at the Second Academy of Moscow University. In 1929, the All-Russian People's Committee specially ordered the establishment of the Institute of Physiology and appointed her as the director of the institute.</p>

<h3>Guangzhou Correspondence: Blind Women Sells Songs</h3>
<p>— Zhenyu</p>
<p>Guangzhou, this city called the "hub of southwestern culture," what impression does it give me? In addition to the ugly government offices, big stores, and mansions of the rich built with our fat and cream, which make people shudder and feel a great threat, on the contrary, there is also the bitter face of the blind women who sell songs, which is unique to this place, deeply imprinted in my mind.</p>
<p>Blind women selling songs also exist in other places, but there are never as many or as special as in Guangzhou. Whether it is spring, summer, autumn, or winter, whether it is morning or evening, as long as there are people on the road! The most are in the area of Changdi: Lizhiwantou and Guipengwei, you can see their traces. They wear dark crystal glasses, wear popular fashions, carry musical instruments, and follow the old women who lead the way, in twos and threes, either wandering the streets or standing blankly by the roadside, humming desolate songs intermittently. As long as you have a dime, you can summon them at any time; and in addition to singing songs, if you want to find a little sexual stimulation in her body, you will not be rejected. This is the characteristic of the blind women in Guangzhou, which is also a layer of "hell" that is not found in other "paradises."</p>
<p>When you first arrive in Guangzhou, you must be surprised that there are so many blind women here, like carp crossing the river, spread all over the roads in groups. According to my investigation: they are not necessarily produced in Guangzhou, most of them come from the countryside in various parts of Guangdong, and they are all daughters of poor families. Their parents certainly don't have the money to provide them with treatment! And they can only consume and cannot produce. No one is willing to marry the remaining women, and leaving them at home is not something that impoverished parents can afford to support them for a lifetime. In addition, in remote rural areas, thinking is backward, and the poison of feudalism is very deep. They are already patriarchal; unfortunately, they are also suffering from disabilities, and they are even more disliked.</p>
<p>Five or six years ago, some "matchmakers" taught them to learn a few folk songs and led them out to entertain people, in order to make a small profit. Their prices are low and they can also provide carnal desires, so they are welcomed by the lower class; gradually, more and more people gather, turning into a deformed profession.</p>
<p>However, recently, they have been unable to maintain even this last line of hope! The number has decreased from more than 1,000 to 400 or 500. This is because to this day, aggression, extortion, destruction, and destruction from all aspects have destroyed the occupations of countless people; even those who have jobs are severely exploited, and life is becoming more and more difficult. Even this cheapest entertainment cannot be enjoyed.</p>
<p>I once "traded" with them once. That blind woman was probably twenty-two or three years old. I ordered a Cantonese song called "Xiao Xiang Qin Yuan," so she took down the qin, tuned the strings, and pulled her throat!</p>
<p>"Hate the east wind | not for me | blow away sorrow! ......"</p>

<p>Her singing voice was gentle, melodious, somber, and sad, truly what is called lamenting, longing, weeping, and complaining, expressing all the entrustments in the lyrics. All art expresses its emotions, life, and life experiences are its soul. This sad song of hers dissolves her tragic fate, like the black slaves' mournful song in Dvorak's New World Symphony. She finished singing, and I gave her four dimes. She seemed very grateful and thanked me with a smile. After she finished, she didn't leave, probably because I gave her two more dimes, and she was waiting for me to enjoy a little more rights! But I felt a pang of sadness, and I also talked to her casually. She told me her tragic experience, as mentioned above. She also talked about her living conditions. She said!</p>
<p>"Three years ago, the price of singing a song was three or four dimes. Twenty or thirty yuan a month was often available. There would be more on hot days, and the guests' special rewards were not included. The expenses were: the big ones were the old woman's wages, which cost six or seven yuan; I lived with several sisters in the same industry, and I tried my best to save money. In addition to making some clothes and spending some pocket money, I also sent money back to my father and mother. However, it is getting worse every year; the current business is so deserted, and the price of a song has been reduced to five cents, and few people trade for a dime! Earning more than ten yuan a month is considered good luck. Sometimes, the expenses are not enough, so I have to eat thin porridge. It is still possible to endure the hot summer, but the winter is really unspeakable! Therefore, many sisters can't live and have to swallow smoke, hang themselves, and go back to their hometowns! What can I do? Of course, no one is willing to marry me; although the officials have issued notices telling us to go to the poor people's education and nursing homes, but we have no relatives, where can we find them? Isn't it still a dead end? ......" If they were born in a "reasonable" society, with society providing them with treatment and education, and enabling them to acquire good skills to seek a legitimate life, it may not be impossible to "overcome the sky with human power" and fill in their "innate" pain, but now they are trampled in the mud, and although they struggle desperately, they still cannot avoid the path of destruction! Alas! Who brutally killed them?</p>

<h3>The Story of the Invention of the Air Rescue Airship (2)</h3>
<p>— Shulin</p>
<p>The question of which country first made balloons in the world is a matter of much debate. Some say it was China. A French missionary who came to China in 1694 wrote in his book that when a certain emperor of China ascended the throne, people set off large balloons in the air to express their congratulations. This is a very interesting story, but unfortunately, it did not record what kind of form the balloon was or what kind of gas was put in the balloon.</p>
<p>In Europe, the first person to make balloons was Pettom Loren Gasmai. Gasmai was born in 1689 in Setos, Brazil. In 1708, he returned to his hometown of Boutogo and began to make balloons. There were no detailed records at the time, so the exact situation is unknown. Gasmai displayed the balloon he made in the square of Lisbon.</p>
<p>Many people gathered near the square to see this rare event, and the king and queen of Boutogo also appeared among these people. Everyone looked at Gasmai's rising balloon with surprised eyes. It was not recorded how high the balloon rose or how big the balloon was. Only one thing is clear, and that is that after Gasmai released the balloon, he was reprimanded by the king and driven out of the country.</p>
<p>It seems very funny today that a great invention would be reprimanded, but at that time, general knowledge was not advanced, and Gasmai's invention was probably regarded as some kind of magic.</p>
<p>Under the crime of bewitching people, Gasmai was exiled, and the invention was terminated.</p>
<p>From this speculation, the fact that Gasmai's balloon could attract people's attention in this way undoubtedly meant that it was a large balloon with a lot of buoyancy. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Competition Between America and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>— Naifu</p>
<p>(1) ················ (1)</p>
<p>When the Soviet Union started the Five-Year Plan, economists from all over the world simply did not consider it a problem. This problem attracted the attention of the world after the third year of the implementation of the Five-Year Plan; because by that time, it was impossible for people not to pay attention to it. One of the slogans of the Five-Year Plan was: "Catch up!" That is to say, the Five-Year Plan was to turn old Russia's agricultural country into a new Russia's large-scale industrial country. In terms of technology and productivity, it should not only catch up with the world's advanced countries, but also surpass them. As for the goal of this advanced country, the first is the United States, and no other country is qualified. Because of the vast territory of the Soviet Union and the abundance of natural resources, there is really no other country that can be compared with it except the United States. Economists from all over the world have only considered this matter a major problem in the last five years.</p>
<p>(2) ············ (2)</p>
<p>The production of goods in the United States from the panic of 1932 to the great panic of last spring had been reduced to the extreme. However, the Soviet Union just happened to complete the First Five-Year Plan at this time, and then started the Second Five-Year Plan, developing its productivity at a rapid pace.</p>
<p>Since 1932, the financial situation of general industry and railways in the United States has been extremely deteriorated, and the demand for means of production has been sharply reduced as a result. Even the American steel industry, which is known as the world's number one, could not escape the attack of panic. According to the annual report of the American Iron and Steel Association, "The amount of steel supplied in 1932 was the lowest amount since the establishment of the Iron and Steel Association in 1901."</p>
<p>In the Soviet Union, although many large-scale iron and steel plants have been newly built in places such as Magnitogorsk, the Urals, and Kuznetsk, and iron production has been increasing at a rapid rate, it still cannot meet the needs of industry. The actual iron production of the United States is restricted to less than 25% of its production capacity, and the annual production almost returns to the low level of 30 years ago in the history of industrial development. According to the report of the American Iron and Steel Association, the comparison between the recent production capacity and actual production amount is as follows:</p>
<p>Business Performance of the American Iron and Steel Association</p>
<p>| Comparison of Production Capacity and Actual Production Amount |</p>
<p>January 1933 Actual Production Amount</p>
<p>Production Capacity 1931 1932</p>
<p>Iron 22.1 7.0 3.1</p>
<p>Steel 27.3 10.1 4.9</p>
<p>Iron 19.3 7.1 3.6</p>
<p>In the Soviet Union, the opposite is true. During the entire period of the Five-Year Plan, there was a feeling that the iron production capacity was insufficient and it became the focus of the problem: even now, no matter how much production is increased, it is still insufficient. Because the production of means of production is more urgent. The more iron is needed, the more it is needed and the supply is insufficient. This completely shows the characteristics of the Soviet Union, where industry is booming, and the United States, where industry has hit a wall. If we look at the actual results and development prospects of the Soviet Union's iron and steel industry in the First Five-Year Plan and the Second Five-Year Plan, this characteristic will become clearer. (Unit: million tons)</p>
<p>First Five-Year Plan Increased Production Second Five-Year Plan Increased Production</p>
<p>Year Plan Period Rate Year Plan Period Rate</p>
<p>1927 | 28 0/0 1937 0/0</p>
<p>Pig Iron 3.028 602 189 16.0 260</p>
<p>Steel 4.017 508 140 17.0 289</p>
<p>Iron 3.031 402 125.5 13.0 301.2</p>
<p>Iron Pipe 0.17 0.3 180.7||</p>
<p>Looking at the table above, it is not difficult for us to predict that when the Second Five-Year Plan ends in the future, the Soviet Union's iron production will catch up with the production capacity of the United States. Because according to objective facts, in the near future, there is still a question of whether the United States will have to mobilize 100% of its current production capacity to meet the demand for iron, and it cannot be said that there is no room for argument that the Soviet Union's iron production will increase according to plan. Therefore, let alone the panic year of 1932, even the average iron production of the United States will soon be caught up by the Soviet steel industry.</p>
<p>(3) ············ (3)</p>
<p>On the one hand, it rises, but on the other hand, it falls. The slogan of catching up is realized faster than expected. Taking the tractors in the farm as an example, although the number of tractors in the Soviet Union is not as large as in the United States, there is a surplus of tractors in the United States and a shortage in the Soviet Union. In the United States, new production has been suspended, and no more supplements are added after the damage is reduced. In the Soviet Union, there is not a single unemployed person in the country, and new production is being carried out in an orderly manner. The productivity of tractor factories is also increasing day by day. The average activity of tractors on American individual farms is only 600 hours per year, while tractors on Soviet collective farms and state-owned farms operate day and night, with 2,500 to 3,000 hours of activity per year. This means that the Soviet Union is far ahead of the United States in this regard. Even in terms of the vastness of a unit of farm area and the huge scale of the farm, the United States is not the enemy of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is still the historical problem of immigration between the United States and Japan. Since the great panic and the wave of bank bankruptcies have swept over like a landslide, the United States now has an army of 15.6 million unemployed people. She not only has to reject foreign immigrants, but also has to implement immigration to foreign countries. The problem of overpopulation, which Japanese imperialism has always advocated, is now a problem for the United States.</p>
<p>(4) ············ (4)</p>
<p>When the Soviet Union first designed the Five-Year Plan, the expert committee of the State Planning Committee predicted that the Soviet economy could be developed at a faster rate than the most prosperous period of the American economic upswing. The reason is that although the Soviet Union is not superior to the United States in terms of the abundance of natural resources and the vastness of land, it is by no means weaker than her. Whether it is coal, iron, oil, wood, and other industrial resources, or possible agricultural products, livestock, fish, fruits, and other consumer resources, they are not inferior to the United States. However, the Soviet Union has two significant advantages: first, it can stand on the international relations of today and fully apply the achievements of the latest world technology that has been completed; second, the Federation has a population of 160 million and has enormous labor resources, and does not need to rely on the power of overseas immigrants like the United States during its development period.</p>
