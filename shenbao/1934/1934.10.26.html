<p>（漢口）　蔣委員長行營發言人因蔡廷鍇近在美國發言、對於淞滬戰役、有責難蔣委員長之處　故特發表一文、駁之、其所言者、頗多向守秘密之事件、該發言人刻在漢口、向追隨蔣委員長、故其所言、當爲蔣氏所深悉、查蔡廷鍇責蔣摧毁十九路軍、所謂政府者、旣未派兵援助、且停止必要之供给、今發言人駁之、謂蔡在閩省、舉兵反叛、卒爲中央軍所駁憒、蔡或因此懐恨而攻擊蔣委員長、但絶不應公然說謊、蓋其時所謂中央政府者、係蔡黨所組成、蔣並無權力也、蔡不諳英語、但回國時、當有機會以說明在美所用中國語言之正碓性質、因其華語之譯文、在美發表者、殊與事實不符也、第一、　防禦上海者、不僅爲十九路軍、蔣委員長所親練之精銳第七十七·七十八兩軍、卽以第五路軍著聞者、適當前敵、其結果此兩師陣亡之人數多至三分之一、除此而外、當防禦上海之際、蔣唯處於公民之地位、其辭呈巳於民國二十年十二月二十一日爲政府所接受、當時報紙可以覆按、然蔣猶無日不與蔣光鼐蔡廷鍇接洽、在民國二十年底與二十一年初之時期中、粤派堅持蔣在職、則國家不能統一、西南不就政府範圍、非蔣辭職　和平無望、此種事實、或未爲世人所共知、蔣爲愛國心所驅動、辭去各種職務、如國如府主席及國軍總司令等是、蔣爲壓力所追、擬覔取執照出洋、乃離京返里、準備放洋、但未至十日、電報紛來、而新政府代衷亦接踵而至、咸以蔣爲愛國之士、不可不回京、以其個人勢力賛助政府爲言、蓋自蔣離京後、新政府握取政權以來、政府權力不出南京、而各部部長幾無一人駐於國都也、蔣委員長辛勞五年、亟需休養、但在此環境下、不忍見國民政府之隨落、　乃循各方面之請、放棄自己退休之志、而歸無人負責之都城、一二八滬戰發生時、蔣雖己在京然無職守、且無權力、不能遣調政府軍隊、其所能爲者、在以其公人地位運用其私人勢力而巳、但鑒於國家之危局、無時不努力貢其軍事之經騐、與治軍之知識、供國家採用、然猶有人向蔣諷示渠僅爲軍事妥員會之一委員耳、顧蔣不爲阻力所挫、猶力請政府與前敵將帥許其前往陣地、謂渠敬不親赴前敵督戰、恐難久持、乃反動派領袖拒絶其請、其動機非爲嫉妒、卽爲惶懼、蓋恐蔣在政治上將處於更堅强之地位也、蔣於是處境兩難、旣未許有可致勝利或可免戰敗之任何權力、而前敵失利時、人又可以戰敗之責歸之也、蔣仍申前往陣地督戰之謂、但爲時秉政者告以如往前敵、將不爲人所歡迎、如竟前往、則第十九路軍受反動派陳某之唆使、難免與第五路軍公然衝突也、按陳某者、後因招商局賄案、爲國人所不齒、現方匿跡於香港、逍遥法外也、蔣雖未克親赴陣地、猶諭第五路軍軍官盡力扶助十九路軍、且有一電、内稱一盡力恊助、不惜犧牲、十九路軍之光榮、卽中國之光榮也「等語、故蔣當時所能爲者、不過電致蔣蔡、陳其意見耳、電文俱在、可證明蔣會電告蔡蔣勿於某時進攻、因在事實上援軍不能於是日前調至上海也、蔣不願於非必要時犧牲兵士、故勸蔣蔡採取防守政策、以待援軍之蒞臨、因前敵軍士當時固力足進攻、但欲殺敵制勝、則兵力尙嫌未足也、凡熟知中國之地形者、皆知浦口與南京之間、有長江阴隔、當時日艦沿江駐守、欲裝運迅速過江、其事極難、故軍隊不得不陸續分批裝運、手續旣較麻繁、而所贄之時間亦較長久云、發言人言至此、乃出示蔣委員長與蔣蔡二人往來之電稿、謂觀此可見（一）蔣委員長會勸勿於某日之前採取攻勢之動作、攻勢擬俟諸援軍到滬之後、　（二）蔣委員長會切實指陳陣錢虚弱、因瀏河方面未駐駐兵防日軍登陸、至少宜駐軍兩國、以資防守、（二）</p>
<p>前敝各司令允遵照蔣之勸告辦理、此節載見於蔣蔡聯名來電中、但蔣委員長雖有此勸告、而瀏灌迄未駐軍、故日軍乘處而入、未過抵抗、緃兵陸、而蔣蔡未得政府之許可、遽自負責諭令十九路軍退出、而抛棄其所有之陣綫、尤不幸者、十九路軍撤退、而第五路軍見無所知、猶繼</p>
<p>續奢門、側面空虚、致陣亡者萬重、當吃緊時期、各方面凾電紛來、責問蔣委員長何故不派援軍、發此凾電者殆巳忘却蔣巳被追辭職、除以私人資格努力設法外、不能有何作爲也、蔣以私人資格設法運兵赴滬、希望其所發之勸告爲人遵辦　援軍先鋒確於指定日期馳抵上海附近、距蔣蔡二人負責撤兵之日、僅差兩日耳　此種不可否詔之事實、乃蔡所發責言之答語、至於其他無關重要之責詞、史無待駁斥矣、滬戰失利後、蔣委員長左右深知當時員相者皆以發委事實爲謂、但委員長不願公佈之也、蔣委員長曾遣第九軍軍長張治中往見蔣蔡、轉述委員長之意旨任何事件、直使公共知之　蔣蔡皆允發表眞相以告世人、但戰事旣華、彼等始終沉默、以致眞相迄未爲外界所共知、但上海華字報載有蔣蔡之言論、據謂彼等對於蔣委員長、毫無指摘可言、政府曾以必要供給盡量接濟之、此乃覆查中國報紙而可知者、是以美國報紙所載蔡氏之言論顯然毫無根據、不過爲反動政治家之宜傳作用耳云、（二十一日路逶電）</p>

<h3 id="c16">因海縮預會談話告英人恒· <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>海縮預備談話會。前此巳有一度舉行。無結果而散。沂數日來又有二度談話之舉行。據外電所傳。日本對於海軍平等之要求。殊爲堅决其無意於華府海約之賡續。巳可不言而喻。揆其用心。蓋在謀未來大戰中之安全兼防英美萬一之合作。就目前之國際形勢言。英美固皆無過間满洲局面之力量。而日人爲防患未然計。仍不能不預爲綢繆。故其海軍平等之主張。自其國防政策與大陸政策之立塲言。自爲應有之結論。</p>
<p>所惜者。英美二國雖不满日本此種要求。而以自身問之未能恊調。尙難成一共同對日之戰線。今日海縮會談之成敗關鍵。尙不在於日本要求之過奢。而在於英美兩大之能否合作。苟能合作。則會議前途。當可樂觀。否則終必陷於破裂之運命也。</p>
<p>今日英美所以不能合作之原因。就其顯著者言。約有數端其間屬於國防者有三。屬於經濟者有一。試略述之。自國防上言。大英帝國之屬地。散處全球。防禦爲難。故其海軍力必須大於任何一國。歐戰以前。英國海軍。採取二國標準主義。卽爲此故。華府會議時。甘願與美平等。要爲一時權宜之計。一至國際多事。自覺有改絃更張之必要。前次海縮預會之後。英國海軍當局·主張恢復第一海軍國之地位。其用意本甚明顯。蓋英人今是東受日本之威脅西有歐陸之顧慮。故其困難。亦較任何他國爲甚。至於美國地處東西兩大洋之間。在自衛上確較大英帝國爲便利。故由華府會議所規定之英美海軍平等。實有利於美。而大不利於英。在今日之海縮談中。美人自必主張維持現狀。而英則覺有乘機糾正之必要。此爲英美不易合作之第一點。歐陸方面。法意最近有結合之勢。其事苟成。則地中海將成二國共有之池沼。英爲保持其東方之交通計。不能不有所顧忌。是以英人態度。亦不能不隨法意之海軍要求而爲轉移。頗與美國之地位不同。此爲英美不易合作之第二點。英以屬地散處。利於多建經巡艦。美則利於多造大型戰艦。故無論採取比率主義或總噸數主義。兩國主張。不能不互相鑿枘。此爲英美不易合作之第三點。至於經濟上之原因。當以戰債問題之糾紛爲首要。而一時亦殊無接近之望。有此數端。故英人至今對於親美親日二途。仍在躊躇徘徊而不知所决也。</p>
<p>吾人以爲英人今日所遭之困難。實因不能與美合作而起。設能合作。則其海軍政策。殊無重採二國標準之必要。蓋英美誠能合作。不獨日本不足慮。法意之聯合。亦易應付。卽賡續華府約之精神。維持與美平等之實力。亦無害於大英帝國之國防。我國之東北問題懸而未决。遠東一隅。戰雲密布。此關懐於世界和平者之所引爲深懼者也。夫我國土地之完整。受華府九國公約之保障。且與海縮問題有不能分割之關係。今觀英人態度。似有不敢過問此點之意。殊不能不令人扼腕。深望英人能澈底思量。勿患短視之病也可。</p>
<p>總之。時至今日。無論從何點觀察。英美苟能合作。則一切問題或可順利解决。否則不僅海縮會議不能成功。卽世界和平前途。亦將大受影響也。</p>
<p>日嗾僞國實施煤油專賣違反九國公約精神</p>
<h3 id="c17">外商請各本國政府提抗議 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>（瀋陽）「满洲國」政府現議制定煤油專權、在满經營油業之英　公司代表巳獲有專賣條例、送交上海總行、並電違有關係之政府、請向日政府提出嚴重抗議、因此項辦法、日政府實有以致之、而違反九國公約第一一一條之精神也、（廿五日路透社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美孚及其他火油公司、因「满洲國」政府决定設立火油專賣制度、係屬違反九國公約第三條開於鬥户機會均等各項規定之精神、特以全力壓迫國務院、囑其向日本政府提出抗議、截至目下爲止、美國政府對於此事尙未進行交涉、希望英國方面必能加以贊助、蓋以大英火油公司同受「满洲國」專利制度之威脅也、此外日本新頒布火油統制法、將外國公司可以輸入之量數加以縮减、而各公司出售火油須在日本設立油棧、所存數量並以每六個月計算、須與出售數量相等、俾遇有戰事時、日本能有多量火油存貯應用、此種法律、亦爲美國各火油公司所反對、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　此間接瀋陽傳來「满洲國」議實行煤油專賣消息、殊爲驚異、蓋此舉不電拒絶外國油公司在满營業也、一般人士以爲日本海軍當局關於油之供給、最爲關心、此可於日本近今立法須油公司常備半年供給、政府遇急要時、得照自定之價收買之舉徵之、惟「满洲國」宣布獨立後、會兩次聲明願遵守與满有關之國際條約、一九三二年四月復照會四十九國聲明願維持開放門户原則、故衆信瀋陽消息必有悞會處、尤其因「满洲國」與東京今方竭誠歡迎英國實業聯合會所派之考察團也、在满外國油公司現巳申請各本國政府援助、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<p>（紐約）　據紐約泰晤士報駐日本東京訪員宣稱、僞满宣佈火汕專賣制度一事、美國進行交涉加以阻止、巳歷數月之久、至英國與荷蘭政府亦經分别由其駐東京外交代表提出交涉、關於此節、美國國務院官員宣稱、英荷兩國政府雖與美國政府同時提出交涉、此則僅爲不約面同、蓋美國僅爲保護其本國商民利益、單獨提出交涉、從未與其他關係國恊議行動、加之美國政府旣未承認「满洲國」、則交涉之事、自必向東京方而提出云、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（華盛頻）美國高級官員今日表示、英美兩國是否完全退出遠東及放棄中國之門户開放政策、將爲明年海軍會議中所應解决之唯一問題、彼等更負責告美聯社、日本之海軍平等建議卽係日本獨覇亞洲左面太平洋之更進一步行動、彼等並謂、現有之五·五·三比率、己使他國單獨對日毫無攻擊或加以壓力之可能、惟英美艦隊恊力以赴、始可在遠東維持部份現有之勢力也、更據消息靈通方面今日表示、英美兩國皆反對放棄其遠東方面之歷史的地位、尤不願放棄中國方面之門户開放政策、惟若千海軍當局及一部份與諭則主張美國完全退出、此間官塲表示、日本所謂海軍平等能裨益世界和平云云、實卽以獨霸東亞征服中國之野心爲根據、據日本之强辯、日本主力艦不敵英美、致使日本在中國之利益常受攻擊、中國亦永無寗日、海軍平等之後、此種「侮辱」卽可消滅、而遠東之緊張局勢亦可和緩矣云云、惟華盛頓專家則不作如是觀、而謂日人常受華人侮辱、實因其對中國之軍事侵略較他入爲多耳、兹悉日本要求各點美國方面絶對不能接受、卽在原則上亦難遷就、美國專家以爲日三方案若予接受、卽無異將華盛頓及倫敦海軍條約之精神完全取消、而使美國海軍成爲祇前防守海岸之艦隊而巳、此間官塲以爲日本之慾望與會議之結果固屬截然兩事、惟華盛頓種種表示咸證倫敦談話中日美兩國之衝突勢所不免、（二十四日國民電）</p>
<p>英美商議日本平等要求</p>
<p>美方態度已通知英</p>
<p>英國態度尙難預斷</p>
<p>（倫敦）　今晨海軍初步談話美國首席代表台維思及美國駐英大使館參贊·與英首相麥唐納及外相西門會商後、外間傳聞美國代表未能贊成日本所提議修改華盛頓條約各節、今晨會議情形雖極端保守機密、但一般人相信美國代表會向英國閣員堅决表示、謂日本要求修改華盛頓海軍條約、過於急進、斷難容許、至於英國方面答復如何、現尙離以預斷、然一般人以爲英國對於日本之融洽態度、將因政治上一新要素、而發生若干影響、此新因素爲何、卽僞满决定設立火油專賣制度一事是也、此間人士聞悉此事、頗爲驚異、認爲此舉顯然違犯僞满及日本政府屢經允許九國條約所規定之尊重門户開放制度、且爲對於九國公約之第一次打擊、今於海軍談話進行之際、突然發生此事、則其不能使日本與英美兩國之和諧、獲得順利之空氣、自屬當然也、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　茲由美人方面探悉、今日海軍談話、美代表甚以日本所提出之要求範圍廣大態度堅强爲駭、至今日談話詳情秘不發表、乃由美國總代表合維斯倡議、蓋恐一經公布、將妨碍日方日後之轉圜也、聞日本巳隠示有取銷華府公約之意、美代表團今日午後會開會討論日本之提案、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　日本政府在此次預備會商席上、主張軍備平等、關於此項要求、現僅傳聞係國防平等權與軍備平等權、但據代表團則稱、當以軍備平等原則爲最正磪、美代表國爲日本要求名義的軍備平等、然松平山本兩代表說明、日本提案主張各國海軍共編的最大限保有噸數、而在此限度内建艦與否係别問題、英美兩方似巳逹到結論、頗難承認如此提案、但英美暫時不欲積極表示反對意見、擬先聽取日代表之具體說明（二十四日日聯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　英日美日兩組業巳開始初步談判、日本代表團左右人士承認、截至目下止、日本代表對英美代表說明之一般意見、在相當範圍之内、僅有試探之性質、日本大使松平與首席專門委員山本少將向英美代表陳述日本政府對海軍問題所取之方針時、其注意之點只在觀察對方發生之反響、日本代表團之態度、由山本少將對報界發表之宣言可以見之、由本謂、日本政府準備一種碓定計劃、但英美海軍部如有反響、則此項計劃亦未始不可修改、設如英美兩國政府給予各該國代表之訓令係全不讓步、則日本計劃甚至並不提出、亦未可知、至少以此次初步談判期内爲然、美國方面對於日本代表</p>
<p>所表示之一般意見、其評論頗不贊成、且表示悲觀、美國人士以爲卽專就技術方面而論、减少重噸數之軍艦與航空母艦、而增加輕噸數之軍艦一層、卽足直接使日本握亞洲海岸及太平洋之霸權、美國人士並謂、日本之要求、如被承認、則華盛頓海約其他簽字之兩國、又焉能阻其不向英美要求平等乎、英國人士則靜待日本意向與美國反響、有較詳細之認識、故目下採取完全保留態度、英國政府之正式態度目下尙未决定、本日下午英外部部員克頼幾會接見日本大使館某參贊、事後雙方均稱、二人會唔之目的僅在將昨日談話之紀録予以梭正而巳、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　美國代表團於日美會議散後、卽時開會研究日本提案、據聞美國代表團待内部意見决定後、始與英國開始交涉、因此現向華盛頓政府電訓中、美國立塲始終擁護相對的安全主義、以對抗日本平等主義、（二十四日日聯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　日代表在日英日美會議說明日本海軍方針、然不過係原則及大綱、對於英美質問作消極的答辯、故英美兩國似未知悉日本提案之全貎、英美最關心之之事項如下、（一）日本是非在名義上及實際上確實要求軍備之平等、（二）最大限主義與日本關於航空母艦及其他攻擊的軍艦主張之關係如何、英美均以此問題爲中心、由海軍專家委員提出質問、（二十</p>

<p>（倫敦）　陸軍大臣海爾珊昨晚在此問發表演說、力陳英國軍事準備之不充分措詞甚爲堅决、海爾珊略謂、「吾國士兵與軍器、兩者俱感缺乏、就軍器供給之來源而言、吾國前曾經詳細討論、碓定政策、此種政策之基礎、卽以爲吾人不必設置大規模之公立兵工廠俾於戰時應吾人之需求、吾人可專恃若干私營軍械廠、於軍器需要不幸增加時、得有所取給、職是之故、就軍器供給之情形、吾人今日遠較廿年前爲退步、然若謂吾國今日青年、較諸二十年之青年、缺乏勇敢與愛國心、則余敢斷言其不然也、上星期六日、余散步攝政街前、見有男女青年、衣黑衫列隊行走、其人數不多、而大隊警察則在旁加以監護其後並有一救護車及國旗多而、由此觀之、今人似以身衣制服、列隊作軍事式之行進、視以爲榮、雖然、余固知全世界制服、鮮有能與吾英軍隊制服相比者、而在吾國内、除英王之陸軍、亦纰斷無其他軍隊也、更有進者、今日大多數人民多有「航空迷」之傾向、甚至有人以爲天空襲擊、其危險旣遠較陸上戰爭爲鉅、則吾人儘可不必再有地上之防衛、其愚魯可笑、竟一至於此、凡屬海陸空軍、負人員、必無一人能同意於此種謬見也、此次英澳飛行比賽、雖足使吾人明瞭天空襲撆之實際能力、然不能因此卽謂保護吾國之彊士、卽不必依頼陸軍、反之陸軍對於防衛之用途轉將更見其重要、一旦不幸吾人必須出而應戰、則爲對付天空襲擊起見、陸地軍力與天空軍力、其屬必要、正屬相同也、云云、（二十五日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>前天偶然瞧見某報上，載有蔡冶民君的死訊，詞客凋零，名流謝世，本是很足使人惋惜悲歎的，蔡君是吳江人，吳江朋友曾告訴我蔡君的兩則軼事，如今我就把牠記載出來，聊以紀念</p>
<p>君家有一婢，明慧善伺人意，添香夜讀，紅袖殷勤，艶福書生，足以慰樂。君固很喜歡伊。可是那婢子不久便買笑倡門，標艶早幟呌做筱凌波，聲名很盛。據說婦女界風行一時的長馬夾，就是伊創製的。</p>
<p>徐待詔逹源室吳珊珊　夫人的盡像，　於碑上，立在鶯脰湖的平波台。後來這碑不知怎樣的移到黎里的一家豆腐店裏去，蔡君見了，斥金贖了歸去。那巳故革命詩人陳去病知道了，很贊美這件事，做了一篇贖碑記。爲藝林所傳誦。</p>
<p>君列名南社，於詩之一道是很有研究的。他爲高鈍劍變雅樓三十年詩徵作序，曾發揮一段議論道：「詩也者，乃本諸無心之傾吐，亦有爲而寄託。一人有一人之詩，一時有一時之詩，一境有一境之詩，有眞性情之流露，斯有眞事實之證明。」可見他詩學的一斑。他的詩流傳在外的，如曕園：「雷　世局不堪論，勝地重經弔白門，一代園林歸鹿夢，百年風月付鵑魂，故家何處滄桑威，往事無邊烟樹痕，曅竟南都王氣盡，興亡曾有幾寒温。」讀柳古楂表餘齋詩集及韜廬食古齋詩録得一絶句：「河東詩族盛當年，老將開山紀律嚴，後起韜廬占一度，盤空硬語落毫巔。」題秋鳥秋花盗幅：「盤雲健翮今何在，萬里風烟夕照　，戢羽枝頭吾倦矣，且留晚節伴黄花。中」也許有詞，可惜我没有見過。</p>

<p>缸是内地居家所必備的。没有了它，便盛不了水，而水又是那麽重要而可寳貴的。尤其是「天落水，」蕃之可以備不時之需。因此，缸便成了居家的恩物。不但此也，要估計一家人家的財產，也可以從水缸證明其貧富貴賤。大户人家：三埭廳，四進屋：每間廳屋的庭心裏，誰家没有缸？又誰家僅列着一隻缸？那缸必定是在兩旁羅列著、宛似僕人迎客般的。有的缸還戴上一頂洋鐵的帽兒。有的缸中還養著金魚，悠哉游哉，得其所哉。</p>
<p>缸旣麽重要，所以内地人家訂親，有些地方要先問媒妁，對方的家裏有幾隻缸的，像江蘇的東壙縣便有這種風俗。訂親，照門當户對的慣例：媒妁登門說親，自然是先問家世，次則要輪到那家公子或小姐的品貎，然後再提及那家的財產等等。可是東塶縣人家的訂親則不然。對方的財產可以不必問，且亦不須問的：因爲只要一問那家的水缸有多少，就可斷定對方的經濟狀况如何了。缸多，則其家必定富裕；反之，則其家一定平常。所謂「門當户對，」全以缸來决定。便是老於做媒的人，往往也不待對方先問及缸，而自先受託的一家明缸有多少的。</p>
<p>看看缸，不過是盛水的用具，而且又是那樣笨重的；想不到它可作估計人家財產的標準，并且還與夫婦的結合有這樣大的關係。</p>

<p>因爲據我所道，前此乾隆回到奉天來的時候，他瞧這裏的建築物，十九都是很陳舊了，而且格式也不好：他原是極精明强幹的人，想怎樣做便怎樣做，於是他就拿出了一筆錢來，敎人在奉天各處，添建了不少新的建築物，而這一座樓，自然也就是他所經營的了。</p>
<p>我們就在這城門下穿過去，中國普通的一般門户，難然都是分着左右平行的兩扇門，其實却是由一而判爲兩的：唯有這裏的城門却是實實在在的兩扇門，因爲它們都是很大的、一般足以獨自掩没這個門洞，不過當初也許是爲求特别嚴密堅固起見，所以疊連的設下兩道城門了。過了這兩扇門，便是奉天的禁城了。一道很闊的御道，直通入深宫中去，我們的隊伍，一走上了御道，便又增加了一種新的色彩；因爲這御道上巳遍鋪了金子一般的黄沙，襯着在上面行動的紅紅緑緑的人物，　可說是五色紛陳了|</p>
<p>這御道的兩旁，還有一些活動的景緻，不能不描寫一下：因爲隨着太后同來的那一大隊御林軍，還不曾來得及調進來的縁故，懷塔布特地從他的營伍中，選調了幾百名满洲兵來，權充太后的　衛；這時候，他們就分着左右，遠遠地跪在御道的兩旁。他們和我們距離大約是三四文路模樣，在這空隙之中，另外還有一批人物，這批人物，也都是奉天的官員，但有一部份是因爲官級太低，够不上資格跑到車站去接駕。（一五九）</p>

<p>新鮮人大都是阿木林，以爲：「鹽菜博士，一定在鹽菜上而，有什麽重大的發明，所以得到這可貴的學位。一也有懷疑的，以爲一鹽菜上面，有什麽重大發明呢？料想這位博士是貧士出身，吃過多年的鹽菜，所以有這譯名。一彼此議論莫决，便去請敎前輩同學，鹽菜二字的確解，怎麽樣？同學們說：「明天，快到了，略聽幾句，便可明瞭他是個鹽菜博士。</p>

<h3 id="c196">典型與現實 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 辛人</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>當我們讀一部可以稱爲藝術的作品的詩候，我們時常在那裏而找到自己的，或是自己周圍的人們的影子。於是我們以同情，憎恨等等的情緒，來給與作品裹的人物：並且大家都有一個共通的感覺：覺得自己日常所间感覺過，而又糢糢糊糊地表現不出來的事物，都像被顯現在那作品裏似的。</p>
<p>這一點就是藝術之所以成爲藝術的地方，也就是我們現在所要談到的，藝術上的典型問題。藝術作品之有典型，且又非有不可的理由，可以分做兩方面來脫。</p>
<p>第一，我們知道藝術跟照像機（Carmeia）是不同的。誰把十九世紀上半的法國社會的一切事件和人物，攝得多多麽周備精緻，也敵不過巴爾札克（HousedeBalzac）的一部「人間喜劇」（Comediebumaine）。因爲前者不能像後者那樣地感動我們，而那懸殊的程度，又幾乎是不能拿來互相較量的。一個照像師或是未逹到藝術家的境地的作家，把一個人物不留絲毫地攝寫下來，而並不怎樣留給我們以深刻的印象：反之，一個藝術底的畫家或作家，却只要用了幾筆或幾句話，就能使我們永記不忘。但問題就在這裏了。藝術家的這幾下筆或幾句話，廣言之，是一幅畫或一部作品，並非隨隨便便地一看到就描寫下來的；那是從現實生活的酒料中，苦心地蒸溜出來精美的酒。我們不管吃了多少的米或高粱（酒的原料），是不會醉的，但我們若到酒店裏碰上幾杯眞正的白乾，那管你酒量多大，結局總要來個大醉小醉。所以，藝術，是現實的綜合底反映，是具體的典型的東西。</p>
<p>其次，我們又知道世界上有最偉大的，最效果的宣傳力的東西，應當首屈藝術。這一點是藝術跟標語口號不同的地方，也卽藝術比牠們偉大的所在。在這裏，藝術有着偉大的啟蒙的，敎育的力量。藝術並非少數人的消閒玩物、牠是大多數人的最珍貴的精神底食糧。因此之故，倘若藝術不能典型化，那末牠只是抄寫浮面的現象，只是冩出「河面的泡沬」，不能表現「河底的巨流」；結果就流於現實的歪曲，或現實的單純化，機械化。這樣的藝術變成有毒的東西，或是喪失了啟蒙的，敎育的力量，同時，也就是喪失了成爲藝術的資格。　　　　（二）</p>
<p>現在、我想引用幾位我們所熟知的藝術作家、對於這問題的意見。但我要求讀者諸君，原諒我在這裏先說了一點覺得是非說不可的感想。就是：在最近的過去，有人認出以前的文藝入門小說作法之類，是没價值的自欺欺人的東西，（而這是確確實實不會錯的，我以爲），可是持這意見者接着就運一切藝術家的創作經騐的自白，都歸在同上之列，不分皂白地否定了。這點是我所不能同意的。我們人類的一切文化，都是一代代地點點滴滴的積下來的，藝術並非高不可攀的神秘東西，更非靠着一點小聰明或「心急」就能造成的東西。所以一切的藝術學徒、都有接取過去的遺產，洞悉偉大的藝術家們以心用換得來的經騐的必要。我之所以引用如次的話，無非就是從這意思出發的。</p>
<p>讓我們引用老巴爾札克的話來吧。他在「未知的傑作」裏，借一個老藝術家的口這樣地說：「藝術的課題，並非在模寫自然，而在表現自然|你並非可憐的模寫家，你是詩人！試由你愛人的手，作出石膏的型來，放在自己的面前，那末你會看見那一點也不親似的可怕的骷髏吧；你就會去探求那並不端頼於正確的模寫，却能傳逹出生動活躍的彫刻家，藝術家吧。我們應該把握信事物和生物的精神，意義，風貎……」</p>
<p>藝術並非呆板的模寫，而是活潑的表現；並非瑣屑事物的蒐集、而是牠們的精神，意義，風貎的把握。這就是典型化，普遍化，各種的社會各有特殊的典型，典型化是複雜的具體的眞實的，所以完全和公式化無緑。法捷耶夫從過去到現在，極力的提倡典型化和普遍化。高爾基更簡切地說：「藝術家非有普遍化的能力不可。……文學者描寫他所熟知的某一小店主，官吏，勞動者，雖能正當地作出一個人的有些成功底的描寫，但那只有喪失了社會底敎育底意義而巳。因之牠在我們的對於人類，生活的認識之擴大和深化上，幾將不能給以什麽東西吧。可是，倘若作家能從各個的，從二十個，五十個，一百個的小店主，官吏，勞動者間，抽出了最性格底的階級底特徵：習慣，趣味，慾望，信仰，語法等等之後，將這結合在一個小店主，官吏，勞動者中，則有這種手法的作家，就能創造出Type，這就是藝術了吧。」</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>上面一些話，也許巳使藝術的典型化問題，有點眉目了。在行將結束的這裏，對於下面的問題，我覺得還有說幾句的秘要。</p>
<p>也是在不久以前，有人以爲藝術旣然必須經過藝術家的意識底裁擇，構作，那末，說藝術是現實的忠實底反映，就根本不通了。驟看起來，這話到也有點道理。但其實，這話若非言者存心歪曲，就是他的疎忽處。</p>
<p>讀者諸君倘如理解我在前面所說的話，當然會澈底的理解現在這個問題的。我們說過：現象的表面底的描寫，事物的瑣屑底的蒐集，這種看來像是「中實」於現實的手法，結局是會轉化到歪曲現實的路上去的。然則所謂忠實於現實的反映云者，就是表示藝術家應該深入到現象的本質中去，在偶然中照出歷史的必然來。藝術家在裁擇，構作的過程中，有兩條路可走：一是在正確的立塲，循上述的道路，將現實在綜合的典型的手法上深刻地表現着，推助着歷史；一是在不正確的立塲，將作品中的事物構成違背客觀法則的東西。但這兩條路都由藝術家自己的世界觀，生活實踐等條件去選擇。</p>
<p>藝術是只有藉普遍化，典型化之助，才能具體地，忠實地反映着現實的。</p>

<p>他行失意的十在山路上，忽然，給一條蛇攔伅在前面，不能通過去。</p>
<p>那蛇長而且大，看來是那末兇惡！他站着遲疑了一會，覺得没有法想，便只好坐在路旁的一顆樹蔭下，休息着了。</p>
<p>他這時巳是走得很疲倦，不想這末一坐，就呼陲着了。</p>
<p>他給人呌醒之後，睁開眼睛看了一看：原來是他的兩個工人。他們是由厰上跑來追他的，因爲現在廠上巳打着旺洞（二），他們愛護着老板，特意跑來追他回去。說着，選將祭在身上的頭子　（三），拿給他看，但他老是那末不肯相信。而且，還以爲他們追他回去，是有意害他，他死也不肯去。</p>
<p>於是，没有辦法。到了後來，他的那兩僴工人看他這末固執，便砍了兩令樹枝扎成一個兜子（四），將他强迫抬回去。</p>
<p>回去後一看，眞的是打着旺洞了！</p>
<p>趙老祖公於是就大發其財！在那年的年底，他僱了許多馬，就將所賺得的錢如數默回家裏去。</p>
<p>他有一個最勢利的女人，在往年他打着蝕本尖子回家去的時候，她是一點也看不起他的　　這年，趙老祖公回家去仍舊穿着以前的那套破舊衣裳，很寒酸的回到家裏。（馬䭾的東西給留在後面。）他的女人見他仍是那副打着澤賬回家來的樣子、便不高興的　起嘴來，走到隣家去了。只見他的一個女兒端出一盆洗臉水來給他洗着臉。</p>
<p>就在這時，他僱的馬到了。他覺得很悲酸，他給了他的女兒一小部分錢外，便凄然的　着馬，仍轉回箇舊去。</p>
<p>他的女人，這時，不用說，是懷着一顆懊悔的心趧忙來追他，但他竟毫不理睬的各自走了。</p>
<p>到了箇舊，趙老祖公便將所有的錢，用　建遺一個廟在寳華山背後。</p>
<p>那裏離箇舊不遼，到廠上去的路要由這裏經過，周園繞着許多高大濃密的緑樹，蟬哪，鳥哪，常時躱在樹葉裏永不疲倦的唱着好聽的歌曲。</p>
<p>一條徥荒蕪幽僻的山岩裏，草業裏，流出來的小溪，環繞在廟門前，嘩嘩嘩的噭流着，水是那末清澈得像水晶一樣。從廠上下來的砂丁，走到了這裏，必定要用手掬起水來吃一吃，因爲從廠上來到了這裏，人多半是感覺得熱而且渴了。</p>
<p>廟裏除供着一位兇惡的　官爺爺外，便是躱在樓下常受人膜拜的趙老祖公。……</p>
<p>那只不過是一個牌位，但香火非常之盛，據說，丹到這裏來祈求的人，都是「有求必應」！</p>
<p>坐在廟門外樹蔭下的石級上，一眼望出夫：對面的出是邪末蒼翠　愛，山下一片緑油油的田野，箇舊是在得低低的。</p>
<p>聽着悅耳的鳥聲，不覺輕輕的蒙了一口氣，竟忘記自己是一個來拜訪趙老祖公的「走廠哥一了。若在嚴上，我的天，那裏容你有這種閒心情來遊賞呢！</p>
<p>註：（一）打尖子就是指開鑛　的事情。（二）打旺洞就是指　在鑛洞裏開採的鑛多而且　好的意思。（三）凡打着旺洞　，所指出來的鑛，有許多　如鵝卵石似的，便呌做頭　子鑛。（四）兜子亦呌做滑杆　，是用以抬人的。</p>

<p>— 何爲</p>
<p>接着是恨恨的往我頭上一拳，正對太陽穴或者鼻子，因着挨打而流鼻血的事，在我那時巳經不算稀罕了。</p>
<p>「自以爲神童，哼，那不過是人家抬舉抬舉你吧了，不識貨的東西！」</p>
<p>拳頭接運的落在桌子上面，一聲哼一拳，一拳之後又是一聲哼，他的鼻子雄牛似的呼着氣。墨汁濺在斗方上，東一塊，西一塊，模模糊糊的認也認不清楚。看光景只得倒賠了，父親尤其怒不可遏搥我，拖我的耳朶，咆　着道：</p>
<p>「不要替我寫，畜生　這樣」點子年紀就搭架子，以後怕連老子娘托你也不　動筆了吧？</p>
<p>「他　　絶對禁止我隨便亂寫，但情形也有不同。大約窮鄰舍拿來的東西，寫　一點也没有大關係。最軍要的，是不能在富房們的斗方上亂拆爛污||如果這樣，父親曾經成嚇說要鞭死我，好在我底下還在幾個弟弟，去了一個是斷不了血脤的。</p>
<p>「先寫紙頭好一點的，有錢人家應得取寈利，開　大吉，你懂嗎？||」他老是撚　子這欀昐咐說：一不錯，你得盡心用力寫，要寫到筆飛墨舞那一種地步。爲了使墨色光亮，字好看，你最好在　墨時放點子白　！」</p>
<p>防飛我不負責任，在寫那些　户家裏的斗方的時候，他老是瞪着眼睛，死定定地注視着我的一筆一畫，一舉一動。彷彿特别體貼我似的，他在那種時候也替我磨墨，按抵頭，把寫好的攤在地上。他又生怕我寫的材料，不合有錢人的身份，忙着替我翻斗方　，指定給我寫。如果寫得好，那他的歡音也　暴怒一樣的使人不快。</p>

<h3 id="c256">華僑被逐 <a href="#c256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— 謙</p>
<p>報紙上每天登載着僑胞被逐歸國的新聞，和許多衣服襤褸的僑民的照片，我看了不覺有說不出的悲哀和失望。</p>
<p>中國久巳成爲「入超」的國家，每年因入超而外流的金錢殊難計數、若照數十餘年的外流算來，中國的財政早巳不可收拾。幸有極多的國外僑胞無形貨物（服務）的出賣而帶回來的一些金錢；而革命事業的成功，亦大抵借助於那些衣服襤褸的被逐歸國以後没有東西吃的那些僑胞的供給。</p>
<p>這樣著來，僑胞的在外服務便是我國工商業剩餘的唯一傾銷貨，唯一的財源供給地。璄在中國在外的僑胞，因爲人數激增，能吃苦，能賺錢，而被各國所妒忌，以致一而再的被武力没收一切財產而逐回；一方面就是貨物的阻碾銷路，另一方面也就增加國内的失業者。像現在中國境内不景氣充满的時候，那裏還有這許多地位安插他們；而簡接所受的影響、就是斷絶帶轉一些的財源，而促成中國財政的危機。</p>
<p>所以要使我國財源不斷，在工商業及一切企業都待墾的現代，唯有極力保障僑胞在國外的活動力，讓他們在外占到些優勢，那玆　，許多重要的國家建設便增加了投資的力量，這是何等的重要而待哺的事件啊！</p>

<p>— 許席珍</p>
<p>（深秋的天是染着重性的流行性感昌的，大地給灑下了一陣灰色的，平淡的，没有明暗的天光，街上行走着車子與人，作坊裏的鎚子有規則地響：然而，這世界却是死寂的，平淡的，孤獨的，殘酷的。</p>
<p>深秋了，風吹着人底衣角的時候，想起了自己的園子裏的紅葉，想起了田角的草菊。）</p>
<p>昇起來的是烟一般的鄉愁呢。</p>
<p>給生活鎭壓着的人是像馬戲塲裏的調老虎的小丑一般的，一鬆手，自家兒便會給呑没了；爲了活，這世界該完全是動的呢：擺動的韆秋架，鐵軌上的列車，地上的飛機的影子。</p>
<p>可是在一個深秋的休息日的時候，「人」的心情又復活過來咧｜｜工作的時候人是機器，没有感受，没有憂傷，没有思索；可是，當「人」的心情復活過來的時候，心頭的思維綫滋長得像四月的野草，瞧着窗子外面没有雲的十月的天空：灰白，空曠；心像給漂白了的大幅的布匹，空白的，可以是摺縐的。</p>
<p>（寂寞像落在地上的葉子。）</p>
<p>擦個火，燃起烈味的紙烟，吸着，又吐着，把奇怪的，憂思的意念溶到了一個個的烟圈裏面去，看它們升起來，又飛開去，可是最後，便無力地消失在半空裏了。</p>
<p>自己也驚詫着，在都會中給生活倒曳着跑的人也有那麽閒情逸緻的機會來打量烟圈兒的姿態的嗎？可是這有　麽辦法呢？人底心是一個有機的組合，和齒輪鐵釘是不同的，它需要休息與滋養，正像人底肉體一樣的哩。一有機會）甚至是一秒鐘」，它便毫不放鬆的射向思索去了，一千里，一萬里的。</p>
<p>讓記憶做了行旅人手裏的手杖，企圖在過去的一些踐踏過的土地上找到一點失掉了的什麽似的；可是結果是正像預期的一樣，是一種像未來一樣的渺茫呢。這啟示對我或者會有一點用處的，它說明了：過去是什麽都没有的。</p>
<p>而未來，經騐告訴人，未來是最靠不住的，如果說眞的有一點什麽未來的路的路，那末，至少在現在看來，它不是與深山的洞穴一樣的遼遠而不可測的嗎？眞的，在原始的時代，誰敢說一個荒洲上的孤獨的旅人能斷定前面的平原是沙漠或是牧州呢？</p>
<p>這麽着，心便像着了水的麵粉一樣的：凝滯了。周園像有許多硬的針在剌射，又像有軟的絲在緾繞。掙扎着，抵抗着，結果便落在一個黏質空白的泥坑裏了，潮濕得怪難受的。</p>
<p>記得什麽人說過：煩惱是優閒中的熟客，當閒散的門剛開放，它便來造訪了。</p>
<p>猛地想起了：這說不出的心頭的紛擾，它是有着一個特定的名詞的：是煩悶！</p>

<p>— 晶雲</p>
<p>「公公，我的肚了巳痛得不能够再前走了」。大毛把雙手緊抱着他的肚子，蹲在骯髒的地上，黄荳般大的汗珠，從額角直淌到瘦削的腮上，像瀑布似地，黑珠子不住地向上翻着，眉頭也緊緊地鎖起來。</p>
<p>「大毛，就忍耐一些兒吧，趁這太陽還没有昇得多高的早晨，多趕幾里路，不是……」張三爹明知道他的孫子趕了幾天幾夜的旱路，同時，又没有得着充足的食物，體力和精神都巳疲倦得不堪，脚跟像生了根似的，委寳是走不動了。他想起過去在家裏的生活，和現在的無定向訽　　流　　尖就有點酸溜溜，眼涙不由自主地從眼角淌瀉下來了。</p>
<p>張三爹是個樸素的老晨，平時做起事來，不誇張，也不苟且，而且一點嗜好都没有，除了在閒暇的時候，抽抽一兩袋旱烟；可是，現在連旱烟也都禁絶了。因此，每年在千辛萬苦地工作中，也還稍有一點積蓄，家庭的生活也頗覺裕如，這是同村的人所羨慕，引以爲模範的。可是，張三爹的獨養子阿根，不幸於三年前的夏天在田裏暴斃了。這使張三爹認爲家門的極大的不幸，同時也自怨着生前的陰德積得太薄，把兒子的死，歸之定命論去了。</p>
<p>本來像張三爹這樣的動勞儉樸，着於積蓄的人，在這荒年，也可以在這困難中勉强地换過日子的。可是，上半年他的老妻和媳婦又害了重病，相繼地死去了，同時又因蠶絲的價格狂跌，使張三爹虧蝕了很多的本錢。這些巳經虧蝕了的本錢，張三爹满心的希望，也許在秋收中可以穫得一些來彌補。但是，自入夏以來，天公老是不肯降雨，田圖都晒裂得好像龜背，把稻苗統統晒成乾草了。在這種苦况底下，「鄕老虎」的地保沈有成所領頭的祈雨會，藉着設壞禱雨，搶龍王……的名詞，向他連逼帶勒地强迫他拿出錢來。這種　無道理的勒萦，張三爹是不肯屈服的。但是他怎能敵得過「　老虎」的沈地保呢！同時，同情</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>於張三爹的人們，又恐惹出是非、抱着「自己打掃門前雪」的宗旨不敢出來援助，於是，張三爹終於在一天的傍晚、在沈地保威嚇之下，反積下來的錢拿給他們了。</p>
<p>現在農村巳是到了山窮水盡的田地了，家裏的一切都巳吃完賣盡，就連樹皮草根也都吃光了。爲了他唯一揖念的年紀小小的孫子大毛，他終於下了决心離開他所不願意離開的家鄕，帶着他的孫子跟同村的人到各處漂泊逃荒了。</p>
<p>許多逃荒者帮忙張三爹揪扭着大毛的背脊和脚筋。張三爹的眼涙像斷了綫的珠珍似的一顆一顆地滴到微喘着氣息而又蒼白得可怕的大毛的臉上。</p>
<p>「大毛恐怕不中用了」！圜觀着的一些老年人却相顧地搖搖着腦袋嘆息着。</p>

<p>我不會跳舞，没有到過跳舞塲，不，被動的到過一次，據說那天擺了拆字灘，不知其意義何在？尙希精於舞塲術語者告我。</p>
<p>各業在終年大减價大贈品聲中，跳舞塲這一行似乎没有波及，一夜擺拆字灘的經騐，覺得資本家不投資於舞塲是大傻子！</p>
<p>不過舞塲裏的主顧以大學生居多，日本巳下命禁止大學生跳舞，如影響所及，勢必也要大登跳一送一的廣告。這樣，這投資似乎也不甚可靠。</p>
<p>我相熟的一位大學生說，日本政府太無聊，大學生跳舞與政府風馬牛不相及，何况跳舞乃正當娱樂，難道大學生一定要埋葬在圖書館裏？</p>
<p>這話有道理，更堂煌，讀書爲的是救國，跳舞也能救國，讀書與跳舞旣異途面同歸，禁何之哉！</p>
<h3 id="c261">冬之隨感 <a href="#c261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— 甲辰</p>
<p>冬天來了，養息在幸福的園子裏的人們，又換上一身貴重的最新式的冬之服裝。大商店的玻璃櫃裏應着時季的需求亦同時堆疊着許許多多的高價的衣飾品，等符一些高貴的人們去消化。又帶來了種種不同的景緻給這些人欣賞。他們有熱水汀的暖房子，有錦質的軟絮被窩，冬天儘是些温密的美麗的夢。無聊的時候可以用着汽車送自己的身體到那更醉人的燈光迷離的舞塲裏，摟着肉或的女人消度漫長的科夜。給關住在彩色的氤氲着香粉味的塲裏邊，口啣着金嘴的吉士牌的雪茄，站在高　洋房子的窗口上，望着底層洋房下的街中，迎着凄厲的冷風飛騰着腿子的黄所車夫，他們會隔了一層玻璃的嘆息：眞够苦呵！可是此時的心靈是輕軟到洋臘似的。因爲後邊金屬的音樂器又奏起催眠的夜夢曲來了。如果是在飄着紛紛的雪花的深夜，蕩在彈性的坐墊上，看見了汽車外邊的街道間，站立着無家可歸的穿着破碎的單衫的孩子和流浪人，他們又會同樣嘆息似的笑着說：天氣多冷呵！可是這些像不怕凍一樣，還穿着那末遮不住身體的衣衫，徘徊在這街頭幹什麽。是的，他們的眼睛只瞧見高洋房上邊緑色的燈，耳朶只聽見靡靡的爵士樂，此外什麽都　不見聽不見的。</p>
<p>另一些人在冬天的冰凍的日子裏怎樣過法，他們又更想也想不到。冬天在另一些人的心上，生活上是織成無邊的愁苦，無邊的黑暗的面幕的。</p>
<p>冬天給這一些人的贈禮是恐怖，殘踏，病亡，故這一些人是怕冬天比怕其他每一個季候更怕，故此他們是詛咒冬天的，厭惡冬天的，把冬天看成一個仇恨似的。可是咒駡儘管咒駡，冬天不並因此而不來或是會變成了春天的冬天。而其實冬天裏的春天早便存在着的，祇是生長在另一個跟他們没緣分的世界而巳。那又另一面的人們是歌頌冬天而又讚美冬天的。冬天亦承受他們的美意笑着臉來到人間，來到他們那一個世界了。大自然曅竟是有欺心的，它瞧不起那些曲着背路，黄着臉的人，它尊動那生活在冬天的春天裏的人們的希求。</p>
<p>冬天裏所有的景物都是珍貴的，翡翠樣的銀閃閃的雪花，打窗外满天飛，將大地鍍成一個水晶的銀色的世界，而在有熱水汀管的窗内，香馥馥的房子裏，喝着紅色的葡萄洒，聆着清脆的歌唱，又看着外面白色的雪在降着，你想，這境地多够味兒。雖然白色的发在另一種是會變成白色的刀，在白色的雪的刀的下面喘息着，呻吟着。可是白色的雪並不因此减少，對别一些人作爲冬天的春天裏唯一的點綴，紅美的點綴。</p>

<p>想一想自己放浪的生活，覺得自己亦是該詛咒的了。我詛咒我明知這些事幹不得却還是幹下去，不當去的地方仍然要去，嘴巴上說這種鹽落的行徑必要改，可是說　管說，事實上依然改不掉，一味的讓它更加堕落、這還不該詛咒麽？</p>
<p>舞塲裏早就看它如魔屈一般，那裏邊許多穿着華麗的衣服的女人便是吸血的魅鬼。披着綵衣而蠕動着的没靈魂的殭窟。可是能這末想，却不能這末做。時不時仍是沉到那些自認爲魔窟的塲所中，安心地聽憑自己的血，自己的精力，一點一滴的給那些鬼魅一口口的嚥下去，絲毫不珍重。也赫毫不售怕，因爲一滑進去我巳經不是我，而變爲另外一個人了。那麽着整個兒就被迷惑過去，跟着人們夢似的溶人夢境般香温當中，忘記了女人是會吸血的，忘記了蕃薇是有剌的，甚至於速自己也忘記了。忘記了一切。祇消那塗有胭脂粉的艶嘴巴密密地扯謊的說出一大串糖甜的話，馬上就患了烟士披里純症，縱使明白話是謊的，也還是相信。　　於是我往日的信念，往日堅强的思想，一下子全給那金色的高跟鞋踐成粉碎了。而且整個身心就踐在金色的高跟鞋下邊喘息着。這時候卽要把當成一匹騾子來騎着怕也是没有不可的，因爲我生命巳不由我自主，而因她們的悲樂而悲樂了。</p>
<p>微明的清晨始跨出了綠色的玻璃門，街上的寒風摕醒了腦中的昏沉，似乎頓然清楚了。摸一摸空壓壓的口袋，金子巳經在昨夜的狂亂中一隻隻溜進女人的手裏。而此刻我換得了什麽没有？除子渾身不可耐的困倦和满心的荒凉威。我一時覺得不知哭還是笑，然而當此清醒的時候生命巳是又一度築满了污漬。</p>
<p>詛咒自己之外尙能詛咒誰呢？那裏邊根本就是　僞與欺騙的交合，女人是賣笑賣歡的，不能呌她老憂愁地裝着哭臉。爲生活呵！誰不知所有的歡情都是時間的，時間的堆砌在金錢的上邊。而自己的金錢是由心血得來，把這心血的</p>

<p>結晶輕地送進女人的笑窩裏，手裏。但是並没人强我一定要這樣，全是自己没出息呵，能想不能做，怨誰，還是自咒自吧。世間可詛咒的人自然多着。自己却是更該詛咒的一個。</p>

<p>時間像流水般的，悄悄的過去了！離開了一切的舊土和故人，獨個的在這沙漠般的環境　，打着轉：繞着圈子。聲　莫，靈魂像是在飄飄的，而没有依附般的，在這陌生的道上，每天枯坐在一間斗室中，自己也不知究竟作些什麽？借着晒台上的一口窗口透氣，將一切的慾欲抑制着，歎難道這就是我們應得的生活代價麽？在這末一個環境裏，不時的這樣感喟着。</p>
<p>清晨，紅日高掛在天空，南國的海，在艶陽下美　的閃耀着。</p>
<p>獨自個兒站在學校的四層樓的晒台上去，遠遠的，悵然凝視着天空，凝視着我的故鄉，是在那一方呢？啊　那責金的童年的樂園啊！多少當年年歡笑，當年的雄心，當年的幻夢，當年的學校生活，當年幾個活潑的朋友，眞是不堪回首。回想起來，一陣陣舊恨新愁，便像濛着遠山的朝霧似的，纒上心來！</p>
<p>不斷的思結，緊緊的鎖住了自己的心。</p>
<p>漂泊在異鄉的生活，正好像颿流在茫茫大海的一隻扁舟，生活老死是隨着時間的飛逝，可没有安定過！被生活的殘酷的皮鞭鞭打着，正好像一匹拖貨車的老馬似的。在這全世界不景氣的動浪中，四處的兵災人禍，啼飢號寒的呼聲，充满在這整個地球上的現在，要想改變自己此刻的痛苦的生活，除非將整個世界，造成一個新生活，完美的樂園，而自己希求「再生」的介量，才不致於漂渺的，像夢一塲！</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>前幾天本刋登載周少堂群的「到西北去的我見」一文，要發起組織一個「開發西北研究會」，我表十二分的同意。「開發西北」的口號，早巳高唱入雲，可是能夥實際去幹的人，還是極少，所以毫無成櫝可言。這續失敗的原故，雖然很多，但是我們青年本身没有强硬的組織是最大的原因。周巍峙君提出的「到西北去的先决間題」的第二個問題：「去了又怎麽？」實是我們必須注意到的，因爲西北是個荒凉不堪的地方，如果我們子然一身，跑到這個地方去，眞是满眼悽凉，舉目無　，如何可以找到職業呢？但是我們如果有了團體的組織，有了切實的計劃，實行門體化去開發西北的富源，那就可以解决這個難題了：不過對於西北現在的　通和　治等間題，　要　以考盧　　對於開發西北是有　切關係的。所以我們一方面雖提倡「到西北去」、，一方面也要爲政府的後盾，促成隴海路綫的計劃，發展西北的交通，改良西北的政治。</p>
<p>進一步說：現在西北的交通是極不便利，消息十分隔閡。我們要到西北去，絶對不能昌一時的勇，貿然前往。事先必須有澈底的研究和實地的考察。所以我認爲組織一個西北考察團，實與開發西北研究會同爲重要。（亦可以說是「開發西北研究會」中的一部份工作）這樣有了澈底的研究和實地的考察以後，那麽團體化的開發西北似較有把握了。</p>
<p>現在我想先組織這個「開發西北研究會」，徵求同志加入，籌設會所，使牠長期存在則我們的同志得以繼續的向西北去。正在呐喊到西北的青年，學生實佔多數，最好在寒假或暑假期中，成立一個西北考察團，考察後，一部份同志就實行負起先鋒的責任，一部份則留守後方深求開發西北應有之智　，這樣互通音訊，互相研究，恊力進行，則西北雖有萬般困難亦當迎刃而開了。我的通訊處是江　復旦大學。望一般有志於西北的青年，來函討論、一切關於組織　進行的問題。並希望能在最短期間把這　曾組　起來。</p>

<p>The Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee is scheduled to open on December 10th, at which time the date for the Fifth National Congress will be decided. Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed the Central Government requesting a postponement.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Committee held its 143rd Standing Committee meeting at 8:00 AM on the 25th. Those present included Ye Chucang, Wang Zhaoming, Ju Zheng, Chen Guofu, Sun Ke, Shao Yuanchong, Zhou Qigang, Chen Lifu, Shi Qingyang, Shi Ying, Ma Chaojun, Cheng Tianfang, Jiao Yitang, Zeng Zhongming, Fu Rulin, Zhu Jiqing, Tang Youren, Deng Jiayan, Chen Shuren, and 28 others.

<p>Telegram from Committee Member Chiang Kai-shek to the Central Government</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Committee Member Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed the Central Government requesting that the Fifth National Congress be postponed. The original telegram reads as follows (salutations omitted): According to telegrams from Gu Zhutong, Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, Yu Hanmou, Li Yangjing, and Miao Peinan, among other bandit-suppression generals who are also members of the Central Committee; telegrams jointly signed by Zhang Xueliang, Qian Dajun, Xia Douyin, He Chengjun, and Zhang Xue; telegrams jointly signed by Chen Qingyun, and telegrams jointly signed by Shang Zhen, they have all stated that the communist bandits have been rampant for nearly eight years, poisoning nine provinces, and devastating the nation's strength and the people's livelihood. Therefore, the bandit-suppression effort is the only urgent task at hand for domestic stability, resisting foreign aggression, national salvation, and survival. Past advances have repeatedly been foiled by temporary setbacks, leading to failure and the unmanageable spread of the bandit scourge. Recalling these past lessons fills us with grief. Since the recent encirclement and suppression, thanks to the unity of all forces and the dedication of the officers and soldiers, our army has achieved successive victories. Recently, important towns such as Shicheng, Gutian, Longyan, and Hetian have been successively recovered. The Red areas are shrinking daily, and the bandit forces are nearing exhaustion. The pseudo-capital of Tingzhou, which has been entrenched in central Jiangxi for many years, can be captured with a wave of the hand, and the bandit chieftains will soon be brought to justice. This is precisely the time for a final struggle, a close-quarters battle, and no moment can be wasted. However, in accordance with party regulations, the Central Committee planned to hold the Fifth National Congress in November. The bandit-suppression troops from Jiangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Sichuan, and Guizhou provinces should elect dozens of representatives. Not only is it difficult to hold elections in the war zones, but if all the senior generals were required to leave their posts to attend the Congress on schedule, it would be deeply concerning that the morale of the troops would be affected and the bandit-suppression effort would be jeopardized, leading to the failure of the entire endeavor. To avoid repeating past mistakes and to encourage the advancement of military affairs, we respectfully request that the Central Committee consider postponing the Fifth National Congress so that the front lines can focus on bandit suppression and complete the mission as soon as possible. The country will be fortunate, and the nation will be fortunate. Considering the progress of the bandit suppression is nearing completion, it is indeed the critical moment to achieve success. The political situation must be stable, and military efforts should not be relaxed. The concerns expressed by Zhutong, Jitang, and other comrades are numerous and are based on real situations that deserve serious consideration. We respectfully forward this request and respectfully request permission to postpone the Fifth National Congress so that all the officers and soldiers can concentrate their efforts and work together to suppress the bandits. In this way, a swift and complete victory can be expected. This is a matter of great importance. We await your decision and will abide accordingly. Chiang Kai-shek, bowing in respect. (Central News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Various Party Headquarters Request Postponement</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Committee has repeatedly received telegrams from various party headquarters requesting that the Fifth National Congress be postponed. The main points of the telegrams are as follows: The Zhejiang Provincial Party Headquarters' telegram states: "The purpose of holding the National Congress is to discuss and improve party affairs and to decide on policy guidelines. It is essential that the entire party be united. Currently, some comrades within the party have differing opinions and have not yet reached a consensus. Furthermore, most of the comrades responsible for military affairs find it difficult to spare time to attend the Fifth National Congress. It is advisable to postpone the meeting slightly." The Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters' telegram states: "The bandit suppression in Jiangxi Province is progressing actively, and the bandits led by Xiao Ke will soon be eliminated. If the military leaders return to Nanjing to attend the Fifth National Congress, it is feared that the military efforts at the front lines will be relaxed. Please postpone the Fifth National Congress until New Year's Day next year." The Nanjing Municipal Party Headquarters' telegram states: "The communist bandits are about to be wiped out, and the party leader and various generals are mostly at the front lines supervising the suppression. If the Congress is convened, it will inevitably affect the success that is about to be achieved. Moreover, some comrades have reservations towards the Central Committee and should first resolve these differences. Please postpone the Fifth National Congress and deliberate on national affairs at your leisure. The time for the postponement should be decided by the Central Committee promptly." The Jiangxi Provincial Party Headquarters' telegram states: "The generals are currently focusing their efforts on bandit suppression, and there are still unresolved differences among comrades that require time to be reconciled. If the Congress is rashly convened at this time, the disputes may intensify. It is necessary to consider the facts flexibly." The Hubei Provincial Party Headquarters' telegram states: "If the Fifth National Congress is held as scheduled, it is feared that the comrades responsible for important military tasks, after returning to Nanjing, will give the communist bandits an opportunity to revive. The meeting should be convened after the bandit-suppression military operations are completed." The Fujian Provincial Party Affairs Commissioner's Office's telegram states: "Bandit suppression is an important task for our party. The communist bandits are about to be completely wiped out, and the comrades responsible for the bandit-suppression work are focused on their responsibilities and cannot spare time to attend the Congress. The Fifth National Congress can be slightly postponed." The Shandong Provincial Party Headquarters' telegram states: "The bandit-suppression work is unlikely to be completed before the Fifth National Congress, and the responsible comrades cannot leave their posts for even a moment. The Congress should be slightly postponed." The Gansu Provincial Party Affairs Guidance Committee's telegram states: "Since the communist bandits have not been eliminated and some comrades have not reached an agreement, the Fifth National Congress should be postponed." The Anhui Provincial Party Affairs Commissioner's Office's telegram states: "The bandit suppression has already achieved successive victories. If the military comrades return to Nanjing to attend the Fifth National Congress, it is feared that the success that is about to be achieved will be ruined. It seems appropriate to postpone the Congress." The Party Headquarters of Hebei, Shanxi, Chahar, Suiyuan, Henan Provinces, the Party Headquarters of Tianjin and Beiping Municipalities, the Northeast Party Affairs Office, and the Beining, Ping-Sui, and Zhengtai Special Party Headquarters' telegram states: "Since the communist bandits still need to be suppressed and a few comrades still need to be united, if the Congress is postponed slightly, it would be greatly beneficial to the future of the party and the nation." The Ningxia Provincial Party Affairs Guidance Committee's telegram states: "Since some comrades have not yet been reconciled and the bandit-suppression military operations have not yet been fully completed, it seems appropriate to postpone the Fifth National Congress." The Sichuan Provincial Party Affairs Commissioner's Office's telegram states: "The bandit-suppression work is at the stage where one more effort will lead to success. The bandits Xu Xiangqian, Xiao Ke, and He Long are currently rampant, and the comrades responsible for military affairs cannot spare time to attend the Congress. The Fifth National Congress should be slightly postponed." Furthermore, Zhang Qiang and other representatives from Zhejiang Province who are attending the Fifth National Congress also telegraphed requesting that the Fifth National Congress be postponed slightly.

<p>(Beiping) Chairman Chiang will go to the hospital for a medical examination within the next few days. He will not be receiving any guests during this time. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yang Yongtai, accompanied by four secretaries, arrived in Beiping from Kaifeng by special train at 2:00 PM this afternoon. Those welcoming him at the station included Yuan Liang, Yu Jinhe, Bao Wenwei, Shang Zhen, Song Zheyuan, Wang Shuchang, Yang Wenkai, Ban Tong, and dozens of others. After getting off the train, Yang greeted the welcoming party one by one and then went to the Juren Hall to rest by car. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Beiping Municipal Labor Unions held a joint meeting at noon on the 25th and decided to send representatives to console Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and request that a welcoming party be held for him to give instructions. (Central News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Chairman Chiang Kai-shek arrived in Beiping on the 24th, he did not receive many visiting guests. It is said that Chiang's visit to Beiping is purely for a medical examination. He suffered from a stomach ailment earlier in the year, and although he was treated, he has not had the time for a thorough examination due to his busy schedule overseeing the bandit suppression. He is taking advantage of his inspection tour of the Northwest to come to Beiping and seek medical attention. (Central News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>The Legislative Yuan Passed the Criminal Law on Crimes Against Morality Yesterday</p>
<h3 id="e4">Part of the Crime of Impairing Marriage and Family Passed <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan convened a meeting at 2:30 PM on the 25th to deliberate on the amendment to the Criminal Law. Sixty-nine committee members attended, chaired by Sun Ke. Many women were present as observers. Deliberations continued on Article 218 of Chapter 16, Crimes Against Morality. Lu Zhiyi stated that the death penalty should be added for those who commit rape and intentionally kill the victim. Liu Ke stated that the amendment mostly stipulates flexible sentences and that the death penalty is only imposed when absolutely necessary. The death penalty for rape and intentional murder is due to the strict penalties in the current Law on the Punishment of Bandits. Therefore, it is still stipulated as the death penalty so that when this special law is abolished, the penalties imposed under the Criminal Law will not differ significantly. Di Ying and Gu Zhenggang supported Lu's proposal, stating that robbers take risks to solve their survival problems and are sentenced to death, while rapists only seek pleasure and are not sentenced to death. Considering the nature of the crime, the penalties seem unfair. Lin Bin, Luo Ding, and others advocated maintaining the amendment, stating that the current Criminal Law fully adopts the principle of retribution and that the implementation of severe penalties has not reduced criminals. Criminals are like sick people and should be treated patiently rather than hastily. Many others spoke, and the chairman submitted Lu's proposal to a vote. The majority voted in favor, and the addition was passed. The third item of this article was changed to the fifth item, and the first and second items were penalized for attempted crimes. Deliberations continued on Articles 219 to 231, all of which were passed on the second reading according to the amendment. Deliberations continued on Chapter 17, Crimes Against Marriage and Family. Articles 232 and 233 were passed without objection. Article 234 states that anyone who has a spouse and commits adultery with another person shall be sentenced to imprisonment for up to three years, and the adulterer shall be subject to the same punishment. Dai Xiujun stated that according to the amendment, if there has been no divorce, a lawsuit cannot be filed under Article 234. This restriction is too strict. Yang Gongjian stated that this article is theoretically untenable because divorce procedures are so cumbersome. If committing adultery is a crime, then 200 million men in China, or perhaps 300 million, would be committing crimes. Therefore, he proposed deleting this article. Huang Youchang proposed restoring Article 256 of the current law, which punishes married women who commit adultery, and also proposed deleting Article 234 and the second item of Article 240 of the amendment. Luo Ding opposed Huang's proposal. Lou Tongsun requested the chairman to put it to a vote and end the discussion. Sun Weidong advocated maintaining Article 256 of the current law. Chuan Bingchang stated that many countries adopt the Anglo-American approach to adultery, recognizing it as a civil matter. Marital discord should at most result in divorce, and there is no need to stipulate further punishment after divorce. Liu Ke stated that since the marital system exists, adultery is naturally out of the question. The amendment adopts the German draft, which states that a lawsuit cannot be filed unless a divorce has been negotiated or adjudicated, in order to maintain family harmony. The current law does not punish married men who commit adultery, which violates the principle of gender equality. Therefore, he advocated amending the law. The chairman then put it to a vote, and 40 of the 69 committee members present voted in favor of deleting this article, which was then passed. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM, and deliberations will continue on the 26th. (Central News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>

<h3 id="e12">Spokesman for the Generalissimo's Headquarters Refutes Cai Tingkai's Remarks in the United States <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>In the Defense of Shanghai, It Was Not Only the 19th Route Army That Was Aided by Troops Sent by Chairman Chiang</p>
<p>(Hankou) Because Cai Tingkai recently made remarks in the United States that criticized Chairman Chiang Kai-shek regarding the Battle of Shanghai, the spokesman for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's headquarters has issued an article refuting them. He reveals many previously confidential events. The spokesman is currently in Hankou, following Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Therefore, his remarks are likely known to Chiang. Cai Tingkai accused Chiang of destroying the 19th Route Army, claiming that the so-called government did not send troops to help and even stopped necessary supplies. The spokesman refutes this, stating that Cai rebelled in Fujian Province and was eventually defeated by the Central Army. Cai may harbor resentment because of this and attack Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, but he should not lie publicly. The so-called central government at that time was formed by Cai's party, and Chiang had no power. Cai does not understand English, but upon returning to China, he will have the opportunity to explain the correct nature of the Chinese language he used in the United States. The translations of his Chinese remarks, as published in the United States, do not match the facts. First, it was not only the 19th Route Army that defended Shanghai. The elite 77th and 78th armies personally trained by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, known as the 5th Army, were at the forefront. As a result, the number of deaths in these two divisions reached one-third. In addition, when defending Shanghai, Chiang was only a civilian. His resignation was accepted by the government on December 21st, 1931, as can be verified by newspapers at the time. However, Chiang still consulted with Chiang Guangnai and Cai Tingkai every day. During the period from the end of 1931 to the beginning of 1932, the Guangdong faction insisted that the country could not be unified if Chiang remained in office, and the Southwest would not join the government. There was no hope for peace unless Chiang resigned. These facts may not be known to the world. Driven by patriotism, Chiang resigned from various positions, such as the chairman of the National Government and the commander-in-chief of the National Army. Chiang was pursued by pressure and planned to obtain a passport to go abroad, so he left Nanjing and returned to his hometown to prepare to go abroad. However, within ten days, telegrams poured in, and representatives from the new government also arrived one after another, all saying that Chiang was a patriot and should return to Nanjing to support the government with his personal influence. Since Chiang left Nanjing, the power of the new government has not extended beyond Nanjing, and almost none of the ministers have resided in the capital. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, after five years of hard work, was in urgent need of rest, but in this environment, he could not bear to see the collapse of the National Government. Therefore, at the request of all parties, he gave up his desire to retire and returned to a capital where no one was responsible. When the January 28th Incident occurred in Shanghai, Chiang was already in Nanjing but had no official position or power and could not dispatch government troops. All he could do was use his personal influence in his civilian capacity. However, given the national crisis, he did his best to contribute his military experience and knowledge to the country for adoption. Yet, some people sarcastically suggested to Chiang that he was only a member of the Military Advisory Committee. Chiang was not deterred by obstacles and still urged the government and the generals at the front lines to allow him to go to the front lines, saying that it would be difficult to sustain the defense for long if he did not personally supervise the battle. However, the leaders of the opposition rejected his request, motivated by either jealousy or fear that Chiang would be in a stronger political position. Chiang was in a dilemma: he was not granted any power that could lead to victory or prevent defeat, but when the front lines were lost, people could blame him for the defeat. Chiang again requested to go to the front lines to supervise the battle, but the officials in power told him that he would not be welcome at the front lines and that if he went, the 19th Route Army, instigated by a certain Chen of the opposition faction, would inevitably clash with the 5th Army. This Chen was later despised by the people for the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company bribery case and is now hiding in Hong Kong, living beyond the reach of the law. Although Chiang was unable to go to the front lines in person, he still instructed the officers of the 5th Army to do their best to support the 19th Route Army, and in one telegram, he said, "Do your best to cooperate, do not hesitate to sacrifice. The glory of the 19th Route Army is the glory of China." Therefore, all Chiang could do at the time was send telegrams to Chiang Guangnai and Cai Tingkai to express his opinions. The telegrams are still available and prove that Chiang telegraphed Chiang and Cai not to attack at a certain time because reinforcements could not be transferred to Shanghai before that date. Chiang did not want to sacrifice soldiers unnecessarily, so he advised Chiang and Cai to adopt a defensive policy to wait for reinforcements. Although the soldiers at the front lines were strong enough to attack at that time, their strength was still insufficient to defeat the enemy. Anyone familiar with the terrain of China knows that the Yangtze River lies between Pukou and Nanjing. At that time, Japanese warships were stationed along the river, making it extremely difficult to transport troops quickly across the river. Therefore, the troops had to be transported in batches, making the process more complicated and time-consuming. At this point, the spokesman presented the telegrams between Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang Guangnai and Cai Tingkai, saying that it could be seen from these: (1) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek advised against taking offensive actions before a certain date, and the offensive was planned to wait until the reinforcements arrived in Shanghai. (2) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek clearly pointed out the weakness of the defense, because no troops were stationed in the Liuhe area to prevent the Japanese army from landing. At least two armies should be stationed there for defense. (3) The commanders at the front had agreed to comply with Chiang's advice. This is recorded in a joint telegram from Chiang and Cai. However, despite Chiang's advice, no troops were stationed in Liuhe, so the Japanese army took advantage of the opportunity and landed without resistance. What was even more unfortunate was that the 19th Route Army withdrew without the permission of the government, abandoning all their positions. Even more unfortunately, the 5th Army was unaware of the 19th Route Army's withdrawal and continued to defend, leaving the flanks exposed, resulting in tens of thousands of casualties. During the critical period, telegrams poured in from all sides, questioning why Chairman Chiang Kai-shek had not sent reinforcements. Those who sent these telegrams had probably forgotten that Chiang had been forced to resign and could do nothing except try to find ways to help in his personal capacity. Chiang tried to find ways to transport troops to Shanghai in his personal capacity, hoping that his advice would be followed. The vanguard of the reinforcements did indeed arrive near Shanghai on the designated date, only two days before Chiang and Cai withdrew their troops. This undeniable fact is the answer to Cai's accusations. As for the other less important accusations, there is no need to refute them. After the defeat in the Battle of Shanghai, those around Chairman Chiang Kai-shek knew that the officials at the time had blamed him for everything, but the Chairman was unwilling to make it public. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek sent Zhang Zhizhong, the commander of the 9th Army, to meet with Chiang and Cai to convey the Chairman's intentions that all events should be made public. Chiang and Cai both agreed to reveal the truth to the world, but after the war, they remained silent, so the truth has not been made known to the outside world. However, the Chinese newspapers in Shanghai reported that Chiang and Cai said they had no criticism of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and that the government had provided them with all necessary supplies. This can be verified by checking the Chinese newspapers. Therefore, Cai's remarks as reported in the American newspapers are clearly baseless and are merely propaganda by reactionary politicians.

<h3 id="e16">Because of Naval Disarmament Preliminary Talks, a Word to the British, Heng <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>The preliminary naval disarmament talks have been held once before, ending without result. In recent days, a second round of talks has been held. According to foreign dispatches, Japan's demand for naval equality is extremely firm, and its intention not to continue the Washington Naval Treaty is self-evident. Its intention is to seek security in future wars and prevent any potential cooperation between Britain and the United States. In terms of the current international situation, neither Britain nor the United States has the power to intervene excessively in the Manchurian situation. However, Japan, in order to prevent future troubles, still cannot help but prepare in advance. Therefore, its advocacy of naval equality, from the standpoint of its national defense policy and continental policy, is a natural conclusion.</p>
<p>What is regrettable is that although Britain and the United States are dissatisfied with Japan's demands, they have not been able to coordinate themselves, making it difficult to form a common front against Japan. The key to the success or failure of today's naval disarmament talks lies not in Japan's excessive demands, but in whether the two major powers, Britain and the United States, can cooperate. If they can cooperate, the future of the conference can be viewed optimistically. Otherwise, it will inevitably end in rupture.</p>
<p>The reasons why Britain and the United States cannot cooperate today can be summarized as follows: three related to national defense and one related to economics. Let's briefly describe them. From the perspective of national defense, the territories of the British Empire are scattered around the globe, making defense difficult. Therefore, its naval power must be greater than that of any other country. Before the European War, the British Navy adopted the two-power standard doctrine for this reason. At the Washington Conference, it was willing to be equal to the United States as a temporary expedient. Once international affairs become turbulent, it feels the need to change course. After the previous preliminary naval disarmament talks, the British naval authorities advocated restoring the status of the first naval power. Its intention was very clear. The British are now threatened by Japan in the East and worried about the European continent in the West. Therefore, its difficulties are greater than those of any other country. As for the United States, it is located between the two major oceans, East and West, making self-defense much more convenient than for the British Empire. Therefore, the naval equality between Britain and the United States stipulated by the Washington Conference is actually beneficial to the United States and greatly disadvantageous to Britain. In today's naval disarmament talks, the Americans will inevitably advocate maintaining the status quo, while the British feel the need to take the opportunity to correct it. This is the first point that makes it difficult for Britain and the United States to cooperate. On the European continent, France and Italy have recently shown a tendency to unite. If this happens, the Mediterranean Sea will become a pool shared by the two countries. In order to maintain its eastern communications, Britain cannot help but have concerns. Therefore, the British attitude cannot but change with the naval demands of France and Italy, which is quite different from the position of the United States. This is the second point that makes it difficult for Britain and the United States to cooperate. Because its territories are scattered, Britain benefits from building more cruisers. The United States, on the other hand, benefits from building more large battleships. Therefore, whether adopting a ratio system or a total tonnage system, the two countries' positions cannot but be mutually incompatible. This is the third point that makes it difficult for Britain and the United States to cooperate. As for the economic reasons, the disputes over war debts are the most important, and there is little hope of reaching an agreement in the short term. For these reasons, the British are still hesitating and wavering between the two paths of being pro-American and pro-Japanese, and do not know which to choose.</p>
<p>We believe that the difficulties faced by the British today are caused by their inability to cooperate with the United States. If they can cooperate, there is no need to re-adopt the two-power standard for their naval policy. If Britain and the United States can truly cooperate, not only is Japan not a concern, but the alliance of France and Italy is also easy to deal with. Even continuing the spirit of the Washington Treaty and maintaining the reality of equality with the United States will not harm the national defense of the British Empire. The Northeast issue of our country remains unresolved, and war clouds are gathering in the Far East. This is what those who care about world peace are deeply concerned about. The territorial integrity of our country is guaranteed by the Washington Nine-Power Treaty and is inextricably linked to the naval disarmament issue. Looking at the British attitude today, it seems that they dare not interfere in this matter, which cannot but make people sigh. It is hoped that the British can thoroughly consider the matter and avoid the disease of shortsightedness.</p>
<p>In short, at this time, no matter from what point of view, if Britain and the United States can cooperate, all problems may be smoothly resolved. Otherwise, not only will the naval disarmament conference fail, but the future of world peace will also be greatly affected.</p>
<p>Japan Instigates the Pseudo-State to Implement Petroleum Monopoly, Violating the Spirit of the Nine-Power Treaty</p>
<h3 id="e17">Foreign Merchants Ask Their Respective Governments to Protest <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>(Shenyang) The "Manchukuo" government is now discussing the formulation of a petroleum monopoly. Representatives of British and American oil companies operating in Manchuria have obtained the monopoly regulations and sent them to their Shanghai headquarters, and have telegraphed the relevant governments, requesting them to lodge a serious protest with the Japanese government, because this measure was actually instigated by the Japanese government and violates the spirit of Article 1 of the Nine-Power Treaty. (25th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Mobil and other oil companies are putting full pressure on the State Department to instruct it to protest to the Japanese government because the "Manchukuo" government's decision to establish a petroleum monopoly system violates the spirit of Article 3 of the Nine-Power Treaty regarding equal opportunity. So far, the US government has not conducted negotiations on this matter, but hopes that Britain will be able to support it, as British oil companies are also threatened by the "Manchukuo" monopoly system. In addition, the new Japanese petroleum control law will reduce the amount of oil that foreign companies can import, and requires companies to establish oil storage facilities in Japan, with the amount stored equal to the amount sold every six months, so that Japan can have a large amount of oil stored for use in case of war. This law is also opposed by American oil companies. (24th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The news from Shenyang that "Manchukuo" is planning to implement a petroleum monopoly is surprising, as this move would reject foreign oil companies operating in Manchuria. It is generally believed that the Japanese naval authorities are most concerned about the supply of oil. This can be seen from Japan's recent legislation requiring oil companies to maintain a six-month supply, which the government can purchase at a price it sets in case of emergency. However, after declaring its independence, "Manchukuo" twice stated that it would abide by international treaties related to Manchuria, and in April 1932, it sent a note to 49 countries stating its willingness to maintain the principle of open door. Therefore, it is widely believed that the news from Shenyang must be a misunderstanding, especially because "Manchukuo" and Tokyo are now sincerely welcoming the inspection team sent by the British Industrial Federation. Foreign oil companies in Manchuria have now applied for assistance from their respective governments. (25th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(New York) According to a correspondent for the New York Times stationed in Tokyo, Japan, the United States has been negotiating to prevent the pseudo-Manchu government from declaring a petroleum monopoly for several months. The British and Dutch governments have also conducted negotiations separately through their diplomatic representatives in Tokyo. Regarding this matter, US State Department officials stated that although the British and Dutch governments launched negotiations at the same time as the US government, this was merely a coincidental agreement, as the United States was only protecting the interests of its own merchants and launched negotiations independently, without coordinating actions with other related countries. In addition, since the US government has not recognized "Manchukuo," the negotiations will inevitably be launched with Tokyo. (25th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Britain and the United States Oppose Japan's Hegemony in the Far East</p>
<h3 id="e18">US Indicates Difficulties in Accepting Japan's Demands, Naval Talks Lead to Intensified Conflicts <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Senior US officials stated today that whether Britain and the United States will completely withdraw from the Far East and abandon the Open Door policy in China will be the only issue to be resolved at next year's naval conference. They further told the Associated Press that Japan's naval equality proposal is a further step towards Japan's hegemony in Asia and the left side of the Pacific. They also said that the existing 5:5:3 ratio makes it impossible for other countries to attack or put pressure on Japan alone, but only by working together can the British and American fleets maintain some of the existing power in the Far East. Furthermore, according to well-informed sources today, Britain and the United States are both opposed to abandoning their historical position in the Far East, and especially unwilling to abandon the Open Door policy in China. However, some naval authorities and a portion of the media advocate that the United States should withdraw completely. Officials here stated that Japan's so-called naval equality can benefit world peace, but it is actually based on its ambition to dominate East Asia and conquer China. According to Japan's argument, Japan's battleships are not as good as those of Britain and the United States, which makes Japan's interests in China often subject to attack, and China will never have peace. After naval equality, this "insult" can be eliminated, and the tense situation in the Far East can be eased. However, Washington experts do not view it that way, saying that the Japanese are often insulted by the Chinese because their military aggression against China is greater than that of others. It is known that the US absolutely cannot accept all the points requested by Japan, and it is difficult to compromise even in principle. US experts believe that if Japan's three proposals are accepted, it would be tantamount to completely abolishing the spirit of the Washington and London naval treaties and making the US Navy a fleet that only defends the coast. Officials here believe that Japan's desires and the outcome of the meeting are completely different things, but various indications in Washington prove that a conflict between Japan and the United States is inevitable in the London talks.

<p>Britain and the United States Discuss Japan's Demand for Equality</p>
<p>US Attitude Has Been Notified to Britain</p>
<p>British Attitude Still Difficult to Predict</p>
<p>(London) After US Chief Delegate to the Preliminary Naval Talks Davis and the Counselor of the US Embassy in Britain met with British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Simon this morning, it was rumored that the US representatives could not agree with the various provisions proposed by Japan to amend the Washington Treaty. Although the situation of this morning's meeting was extremely confidential, it is generally believed that the US representatives firmly told the British cabinet members that Japan's request to amend the Washington Naval Treaty was too radical and difficult to allow. As for the British response, it is still difficult to predict at present. However, it is generally believed that the British's accommodating attitude towards Japan will be somewhat affected by a new political element. This new element is the decision of the pseudo-Manchu to establish a petroleum monopoly system. People here were quite surprised to hear about this matter, believing that this move clearly violates the respect for the Open Door system stipulated in the Nine-Power Treaty, which the pseudo-Manchu and Japanese governments have repeatedly promised, and is the first blow to the Nine-Power Treaty. Now that this incident has occurred suddenly during the naval talks, it is, of course, impossible for it to create a smooth atmosphere for harmony between Japan and Britain and the United States. (25th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) According to information from the American side, the American representative was shocked by the wide scope and firm attitude of the requests made by Japan during today's naval talks. The details of today's talks are not disclosed due to the advocacy of the chief American representative, He Weisi, for fear that their publication will hinder Japan's future room for maneuver. It is said that Japan has implicitly indicated its intention to cancel the Washington Convention. The American delegation held a meeting this afternoon to discuss Japan's proposal. (24th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Japanese government advocated equality of armaments at this preliminary consultation. Regarding this request, it is currently only rumored that it is the right to national defense equality and the right to armaments equality, but the delegation said that the principle of armaments equality should be regarded as the most correct. The American representative opposed Japan's demand for nominal armaments equality, but Matsudaira and Yamamoto explained that Japan's proposal advocates the maximum tonnage that the navies of all countries jointly compile, and whether to build ships within this limit is a separate issue. Britain and the United States seem to have reached a conclusion that it is difficult to recognize such a proposal, but Britain and the United States temporarily do not want to actively express their opposition and intend to first listen to the Japanese representative's specific explanation. (24th Japan News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The British-Japanese and American-Japanese groups have already started preliminary negotiations. People around the Japanese delegation admit that, so far, the general opinions explained by the Japanese representatives to the British and American representatives are only exploratory in nature within a considerable scope. When Japanese Ambassador Matsudaira and Chief Expert Committee member Major General Yamamoto presented the Japanese government's policy on naval issues to the British and American representatives, their focus was only on observing the reactions of the other party. The attitude of the Japanese delegation can be seen from the declaration issued to the press by Major General Yamamoto. Ben Wei said that the Japanese government is preparing a definite plan, but if the British and American naval departments have any reactions, this plan may not be impossible to modify. If the instructions given to the representatives of the British and American governments are completely uncompromising, then the Japanese plan may not even be proposed, at least within the period of this preliminary negotiation. The American side's comments on the general opinions expressed by the Japanese representatives are quite disapproving and express pessimism. American people believe that, even solely from a technical point of view, reducing the number of heavy-tonnage warships and aircraft carriers and increasing the number of light-tonnage warships is enough to directly enable Japan to grasp hegemony over the Asian coast and the Pacific Ocean. American people also said that if Japan's demands are recognized, then how can the other two signatories to the Washington Naval Treaty prevent it from demanding equality from Britain and the United States? British people are waiting for a more detailed understanding of Japan's intentions and the American reaction, so they are currently adopting a completely reserved attitude. The formal attitude of the British government has not yet been decided. Today, British Foreign Office member Clerk met with a certain counselor of the Japanese Embassy. Afterwards, both sides stated that the purpose of the two people's meeting was only to amend the records of yesterday's talks. (24th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) After the US-Japan meeting, the US delegation immediately held a meeting to study the Japanese proposal. It is reported that the US delegation will start negotiations with Britain only after the internal opinions are decided. Therefore, in the current telegram to the Washington government, the US's position is to always uphold relative security to counter Japan's egalitarianism. (24th Japan News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Japanese representatives explained Japan's naval policy at the British-Japanese and American-Japanese meetings, but it was only a matter of principle and outline, and made passive replies to the questions from Britain and the United States. Therefore, Britain and the United States do not seem to know the full picture of Japan's proposal. The matters that Britain and the United States are most concerned about are as follows: (1) Whether Japan is indeed demanding equality of armaments in name and in reality. (2) How the maximum limit principle relates to Japan's claims regarding aircraft carriers and other offensive warships. Both Britain and the United States regard this issue as the center, and the naval expert committee raised questions. (24th Japan News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>France Pays Attention to the London Naval Conference</p>

<p>(Paris) The report quoted Naval Minister Pietri as saying that Italy's decision to add two 35,000-ton cruisers has forced France to rush to build two first-line battleships, which France had originally tried to avoid. Pietri also said that Italy could have added two ships under the current treaty, but Britain and other relevant countries have repeatedly stated that they are willing to stop building first-line battleships. Pietri concluded by saying that France is paying close attention to the naval talks in London. As for France's position, it is known to all countries and cannot repeat the mistakes of the Washington Naval Conference thirteen years ago and be ignored. (25th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>British Secretary of War Gives a Speech, Saying Britain's Military Strength is Insufficient</p>
<h3 id="e21">Feeling a Lack of Both Soldiers and Military Equipment <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>(London) Secretary of War Halesham gave a speech here last night, strongly arguing that Britain's military preparations are insufficient. Halesham said, "Our country feels a lack of both soldiers and military equipment. In terms of the source of military equipment supply, our country has previously discussed in detail and determined a policy. The basis of this policy is that we do not need to set up large-scale public arsenals to meet our needs in wartime. We can rely solely on some private munitions factories to provide us with supplies when the need for military equipment unfortunately increases. For this reason, in terms of the situation of military equipment supply, we are today far more backward than we were 20 years ago. However, if we say that the young people of our country today lack courage and patriotism compared to the young people of 20 years ago, then I dare to say that this is not the case. Last Saturday, I was walking in Regent Street when I saw young men and women wearing black shirts marching in formation. There were not many of them, but a large number of police were guarding them. Behind them was an ambulance and many national flags. From this, it seems that people today regard it as an honor to wear uniforms and march in military formation. Although, I certainly know that few uniforms in the world can compare with the uniforms of our British army, and in our country, apart from the King of England's army, there is definitely no other army. What is even more advanced is that most people today tend to be 'aviation enthusiasts', and some even think that air strikes are far more dangerous than land warfare, so we can do without land defenses. Their foolishness is so laughable that it has reached this point. No one in the navy, army, or air force would agree with this fallacy. Although this year's British-Australian air race is enough to make us understand the actual capabilities of air strikes, it cannot be said that protecting our country does not require relying on the army. On the contrary, the army's use for defense will become even more important. Once we unfortunately have to go to war, in order to deal with air strikes, both land forces and air forces are equally necessary." (25th Havas News Agency Dispatch)</p>

At present, the diplomatic authorities are focusing all their efforts on this. (25th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>

Vollischmann, who is only 24 years old and is called "his master's eyes," was tried by a court here today. According to the prosecutor, in March of this year, the police arrested a Frenchman named Albar, whose behavior was suspicious. He confessed that he had been forced by poverty to supply information to a certain foreign country, which was secretly transmitted orally outside of France.

Larsick and his companion arrived as scheduled in a large car. As they were talking, the police suddenly appeared from their hiding places and arrested them. After the trial today, Larsick was sentenced to 18 months in prison, and Krebbs, the mastermind of the entire case, was sentenced to five years in prison. Both plan to appeal.

According to political sources, the official purpose of the French Ambassador's visit was to express the French government's gratitude to Hitler for sending condolences after the death of French Foreign Minister Barthou in the Marseille assassination. However, the actual purpose was not that simple. One newspaper reported that the French Ambassador took this opportunity to discuss with Hitler the resolution of all outstanding issues between Germany and France. Although this is vague, it proves that the two governments are in communication again. It is said that Hitler's previous meeting with the Polish envoy was a prelude to this matter.

<p>Roosevelt Announces Right-Leaning Economic Policy</p>
<h3 id="e29">Calls for Unity in All Industries to Achieve Recovery; No Direct Expression on Currency Issues <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt, in a speech to the American Bankers Association today, called on all sectors of agriculture, industry, and commerce to unite and maintain the traditional economic system of the United States. The President also expressed his approval of profit-making in all industries and denied the "New Deal" socialization theory. Regarding monetary policy, while he stated that there was no intention to engage in further aggressive expansion, he made no specific guarantees. On the crucial issues of stabilizing finance, establishing a government-controlled central bank, and balancing the budget, the President offered no words to comfort public expectations. However, those who heard the speech generally believe that the President has shifted to the right, and the future is somewhat reassuring. The President's tone was very moderate, and he urged bankers to take responsibility for the people and restore their faith. Observers interpreted this as a challenge to financial giants. Regarding the monetary issue that banks had hoped the President would clarify, the President vaguely stated that countries are increasingly eager for price stability, which is also the national policy of various countries. Regarding the need for large sums of money to relieve unemployment, the President said, "After commercial recovery and prosperity, this burden will be lightened." He expressed optimism about the progress of the recovery and said that the government is making every effort to promote public investment. The President explained his concept of government, saying that the old notion of a banker and the government each acting independently and not conspiring with each other has become a thing of the past. The government is the external representation of the common life of all citizens, so the government should lead and judge the interests of various conflicts in society, and bankers are no exception. After vehemently denying the red scare of the New Deal, the President declared, "True national wealth is not a static thing. When everyone cooperates, the national wealth increases day by day. When there is misunderstanding and suspicion, the national wealth stagnates. The United States has the material resources to increase true wealth. Americans believe that true wealth is the reward for mental and physical labor, which is the so-called profit-making system." The President expressed satisfaction with American businessmen's attention to national affairs. The President also pointed to last year's banking crisis as the process by which American banks have achieved their current stable position, and believes that today is a mature opportunity for all industries to unite and achieve commercial recovery, and said that the people are generally expecting us to do our job well. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt delivered a speech at the annual meeting of the American Bankers Association last night, and Treasury Secretary Morgenthau also delivered a speech this morning. In his speech, the President still advocated the private capital system and did not admit that there was a tendency towards socialism in the "New Deal". Some people were disappointed that the President would not explain the policy in detail, but most financial leaders were very satisfied that the President had indicated that he did not intend to engage in further aggressive expansionary policies. Although the President's speech did not directly discuss the issue of stabilizing the currency, his tone was moderate and he allowed the banking community to say that once private capital shows its willingness to respond to the industry's confidence in lending, the government's lending activities can be stopped. The government still needs to continue lending, but it is urging the banking community to take this responsibility as soon as possible. (National Society Telegram, 25th)</p>

After Prime Minister Okada requested the Emperor's approval, the appointment ceremony was held in the Imperial Palace.

<p>(Tokyo) The decision to appoint Earl Hideo Kodama as the full-time Minister of Colonial Affairs was made with the strong support of the military. The military considered various circumstances and advocated the necessity of setting up a full-time Minister of Colonial Affairs, and the criteria for evaluating candidates should meet the following conditions: (1) a person who is well-versed in local affairs; (2) recognizes the importance of the military in implementing the national policy of Manchuria and cooperates with it; (3) has considerable insight into the situation after resolving the disputes of the Kwantung resident staff. According to this view, the entire department believed that Earl Kodama was the most suitable candidate. As a result of Army Minister Hayashi's advice to Prime Minister Okada, the decision was made. (Dentsu News Agency, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, the newly appointed Minister of Colonial Affairs, Earl Hideo Kodama, gave the following speech to reporters after the appointment ceremony: It is said that the disputes caused by the opportunity of the Manchurian institution reform by local residents are caused by worrying about the nation's beliefs. Therefore, it cannot be regarded as a general dispute. However, since the issue has been decided by the Cabinet, it will be resolved soon. The government will seek active measures to stop onlookers. Because I am a member of the Cabinet, I have not been able to state my firm aspirations. However, I will definitely strive to unify the unintegrated foreign areas and seek countermeasures in cooperation. (Dentsu News Agency, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The new Minister of Colonial Affairs, Hideo Kodama, is the son of Army General Gentaro Kodama. After graduating from Tokyo Imperial University, he served as Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, Director-General of the General Affairs Bureau of the Governor-General of Korea, Chief Secretary of the Terauchi Cabinet, President of the Rewarding Bureau, and Governor of Kwantung. In 1929, he was appointed Director-General of Political Affairs of the Governor-General of Korea, and resigned in 1931. After that, he devoted himself to educational undertakings and is now an influential member of the Research Association. It is said that Kodama has a good relationship with the military, so the colonial administration will surely yield good results in the future. (Japan United Press, 25th)</p>

<p>(Xiamen) The main force of the Communist bandits gathered in Ruijin and invaded the south from Huichang and Yudu. According to military news here, the fortifications of the Southern Route Army are extremely strong and not easy to conquer. A part of the bandits stayed in Tingzhou to defend the Xinyue Ridge in the west of the city and the Gucheng Mountain area to cover Ruijin. There is only a forward team in Tingzhou City. (Special Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) The Eastern Route Army for the attack on Tingzhou is ready and will launch an attack within days. Chiang Ting-wen telegraphed Chen Jitang, requesting that all units of the Southern Route Army cooperate. Because the bandits' weapons are incomplete and ammunition is lacking, they have no countermeasures. According to reconnaissance reports, the puppet Central Military Commission intends to (1) concentrate between Ruijin and Shicheng or near Ruijin and Changting to preserve the puppet Central Soviet Area; (2) if defeated, part of them will be divided into small groups and scattered along the Fujian-Jiangxi border, and part of them will flee to the border between Hunan and Sichuan via Anyuan and Xinfeng. If they cannot escape, they will flee to northwestern Fujian and eastern Guangdong, luring our army to pursue them in order to preserve the scattered bandit areas in southern Jiangxi. Our army is prepared for the bandits' conspiracy. The Communist bandits who were entrenched in Baizhu were defeated by the New Tenth Division, and a letter from the puppet Eastern Fujian Special Committee to the Lianjiang puppet County Committee was seized. The content of the letter roughly stated that the Eastern Fujian Red Army had suffered disastrous defeats in Fuan and Xiapu, and the losses were huge. Now, Ye Fei is being sent to Lian to discuss the formation of the First Regiment of the Red Army to open up eastern Fujian and replenish the army. Chen Qixuan reported that he had ordered his subordinates to take strict precautions separately and to intensify the search and suppression to clear the remaining bandits.

<p>(Guangzhou) According to a telegram from the front line, the government army and the Communist bandits engaged in a fierce battle outside the Guangdong provincial border this morning.

<p>(Hankou) Zhang Xueliang said in his training speech at the Rural Sports Conference on the 25th that the bankruptcy of the countryside and the decline of morality are mutually causal. Therefore, rescuing the countryside can restore inherent morality, and restoring inherent morality is also a necessary condition for rescuing the countryside. He also pointed out that there are three points that must be met to save agriculture: one is modernization, the second is actualization, and the third is rationalization. Zhang Qun spoke in three points: one is that Hubei lacks educational talents, so attention must be paid to education; two is that the people are poor after the disaster, so attention must be paid to nurturing; and three is that attention must be paid to sanitation after the bandit disaster.

<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: Since the 10th of this month, news has repeatedly spread in Bian that Chairman Chiang would come to inspect. All agencies and schools were rushing to prepare a welcome, and were very busy. On the 14th, all the main roads once hung cloth banners to welcome Chiang Kai-shek. However, heaven was not kind, and heavy rain fell, discoloring the new cloth and blurring the handwriting. On the 18th, representatives from various agencies were again recommended to establish a welcoming preparatory committee. This morning (today, the 23rd), "Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, who defends against bandits and resists insults," "Chairman Chiang Kai-shek who protects the nation," "Welcome Chairman Chiang Kai-shek who is hardworking and meritorious," "Welcome Chairman Chiang Kai-shek who promotes traditional morality" and other slogans have been properly posted and hung on all main roads. Liu Zhi, Chairman of the Provincial Government, Hong Ludong, Special Commissioner of Party Affairs, and Du Jun, Acting President of Henan University, went to Zhengzhou at 5:00 AM to greet him. At about 9:00 AM, the Public Security Bureau ordered all businesses and households to hang the national flag. Soon, representatives from various government agencies and schools formed teams and went to the train station to wait eagerly. At about 12:00 PM, all civil servants and students stood upright outside the station. Subsequently, various Party, government, and military dignitaries arrived one after another. The number of cars parked was unprecedented in Bian. Traffic order was maintained by the Suijing Battalion, armed police from the Public Security Bureau, and the 60th Division. Security was tight. On the platform, in addition to the leaders of various agencies, reporters from various newspapers, and a military band, there were no idlers. At 12:50 PM, two planes flew in from the west, circling in the sky. More than 5,000 welcomers immediately craned their necks and looked forward. As the wind picked up and sand swirled, the special train entered the station amid the melodious sound of military music. There were a total of twelve cars. Chiang emerged from the yellow car in the sixth car, wearing a black padded robe and a mandarin jacket. Liu Zhi and Chen Pei, the commander of the 60th Division, accompanied him. After inspecting the troops at the station, Chiang exchanged greetings with the welcomers, re-boarded the car to rest. The troops of the 60th Division left the station first, followed by Yang Yongtai, Chiang Bo-cheng, etc., who rode into the city. Liu Zhi ordered the welcomers outside the station to return to the city, and then re-entered the station and stood by the car. Madam Yang, Madam Liu Zhi, accompanied Soong Mei-ling, etc., got off the car and entered the city. The leaders of various agencies at the station also entered the city upon Liu Zhi's order. Only Liu and a few others remained at the station to wait for Chiang. It was not until 3:00 PM that they got out of the car and entered the city to go to the Provincial Government. (23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e87">Zhang Xueliang Talks About His Impressions of Inspecting the Northwest <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Zhang Xueliang followed Chairman Chiang from Hankou to Luoyang on the 9th, then went to Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and other places for inspection. On the 22nd, he returned to Luoyang with Chairman Chiang. Chairman Chiang went to Zhengzhou, and arrived in Kaifeng on the 23rd. Whether he will go to Beiping or return to Hankou within days has not yet been decided. Zhang, on the other hand, flew south by Ford aircraft from Luoyang on the 12th. On the 23rd, Zhang published his experiences and impressions of his trip to the west, as well as his views on the future development of the Northwest, as follows: "I accompanied Chairman Chiang from Hankou to Luoyang this time to participate in the opening ceremony of the Tenth Military Academy Branch. Then, I took a car from Luoyang to Weinan and then went to Xi'an. I stayed in Xi'an for two days. Due to the rain, I was unable to inspect the entire area. Later, on a good day, I inspected the troops directly under Yang Hucheng, who was about to take office. Chairman Chiang and I both gave separate speeches. Afterwards, I took a plane to Lanzhou and then flew to Ningxia. I stayed there briefly. After returning to Xi'an, and returned to Luoyang, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek immediately set off to Bian. Because I needed to deal with department affairs urgently, I returned to Hankou by plane. In total, I traveled to four provinces on this tour, lasting half a month. My impressions of the inspection are that the greatness of the Northwest is completely different from what I imagined before I went there. I saw the highway built by Zuo Zongtang when he conquered Xinjiang, stretching from Tongguan to the entire Xinjiang region. I heard that at that time, the trees on both sides were lush, the green shade covered the sun, and pedestrians found it extremely convenient. The Great Wall, which stretches across the territory in an endless winding line, and the An Canal and Tang Canal, are all extremely great construction projects. However, the trees on the side of the road have been felled a lot over the years. In recent years, efforts have been made to cultivate and protect them. The buildings in Lanzhou are also very majestic, and their atmosphere is similar to that of Beiping. In the late Qing Dynasty, there was already a woolen mill run by Zuo Zongtang and others, and the Yellow River Iron Bridge, both of which were extremely large in scale. Ningxia, relying on the Helan Mountains to the north and the Yellow River to the east, is especially majestic in shape and is indeed an important military location. Unfortunately, the people are poor and the economy is not as good as in Shaanxi and Gansu. I believe that to develop the Northwest, we must first pay attention to the development of transportation. For example, the Longhai Railway has already been extended to Weinan, and it is expected to reach Xi'an by the end of this year, and it will officially open to traffic on New Year's Day next year. The Xi'an-Pingliang-Lanzhou Highway, completed by the National Economic Commission, is also barely passable, but this is still preliminary work. Further efforts are still needed in the future. I sincerely hope that the people of the country will pay close attention to the Northwest, jointly seek the development of the borderlands, and truly rely on it for the future of the nation."

<h3 id="e88">A Glimpse of the Miao Yi Rebellion in Mengzi, Yunnan <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The Niu Bandit calls himself the Heavenly Emperor, and the Garrison Team will Pacify Immediately</p>
<p>Kunming Correspondence: Mengzi County belongs to the interior and exterior border region. There is a Miao Yi named Niu Wancai who calls himself the Nine Heavens Emperor. In Galami, which belongs to Mengzi County, he privately built a false imperial palace, appointed Ranmin Peng, the son of a pig butcher, as the false Chief of the General Staff, privately engraved and printed talismans, and made flying symbols. He went to the Miao Yi areas belonging to Mengba and Gejie and other districts, spreading rumors and bewitching the public. He successively gathered about a thousand Miao people and bandits. In the area, he disturbed the peace. He also privately appointed Miao Yi Yang, Ya Xiaodehong, etc. as false generals, Huang Lisi, Yang Wanming, etc. as false commanders, Huang Xiaobao, Yang Sanmiaozi, etc. as false elders, Gao Liu, Xiao Huangkai, etc. as false captains, and other Xiao Zhukai and Zhu Xiaosi as false battalion commanders. On September 12, they attacked Lengquan. Fortunately, Li Yizhi, the magistrate of Mengzi County, and gentry and merchants from all walks of life had received news earlier. Because of the urgency of the situation, they telegraphed the headquarters successively, and on the one hand, they discussed with Li Song, the commander of the Independent Second Regiment stationed in Mengzi, the opportunity to suppress the bandits. The regiment commander Li dispatched two battalions of troops and the local defense team to assist in the suppression. Before the bandits attacked Lengquan, they were prepared to block them. When the bandits arrived, they were caught off guard and met head-on. The rabble was scattered, and Feng Qu Tuan led the local militia to guide them to the bandit's nest in Galami on the 17th, burning down the false imperial palace and Shuishui Ke bandit's nest. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e89">Situation of the Rebellion <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The bandit leader of this rebellion, Niu Wancai, is from Galami in the Lengquan area. His ancestors had a small legacy, which he squandered, and he was heavily in debt. He fled to other places and did not return for more than a year. Now he suddenly returned, but people did not know where he came from. Niu then took advantage of the remnants of the Miao rebellion in Qiubei, Xiong Peisheng, to incite rebellion in the alien border, and secretly colluded with him to create rumors, saying that the Celestial Master would help him fly swords and the destiny of heaven would return to the Yi and the Han would perish together. He specialized in exhausting the senses in order to advocate rebellion. The ignorant and stubborn Yi and Miao people were easily bewitched. Shuishui Ke Yang Zifan and Mushu Ke Yang Wanming were particularly devout monks, and their disciples were numerous. Niu's wings had already been formed, so he openly spread rumors, saying that the cycle of heaven's fortune was endless and that there was a number of rises and falls, and used the slogan of not paying rent or donating money to call on the Yi and Miao people to join him. Seeing that most of the Yi and Miao people were inclined to him, Niu dyed his skin all over with Miao colors and called himself the Great Emperor, making flags, talismans, and privately printed meanings. He abused official titles, appointing Yang Mufan as a general and Yang Wanming as a great general, Huang Dacong and Du Zi'en as left and right prime ministers. Anyone who could gather more than ten people would be appointed as the name of a captain of a battalion or company. After the rumors spread and the false appointment letters were issued, Xiang Xingshen, also known as Xiang Miao, with the alias Longneck, Li Guotai, Hu Wancai, Xiong Peijin, Lao Dayu, Shi Shibaobao and others, who had been bandits for many years and had escaped being suppressed, relapsed into their old ways and gathered the remaining bandits in response, hoping to take the opportunity to start an incident. The wind and rumors spread, and the people were suspicious and avoided each other. In the early part of September, the bandits set up yellow and white flags in Shuishui Ke Galami and other places, claiming that they would attack Lengquan on September 12 and Mengzi on the 16th. Previously, on September 9, Mu Su Ke Tang Guifang and his brothers Gui Xing and Gui Ji were ambushed and shot to death by the false general Yang Wanming at Xiao'an Yakou on their way back to Lengquan after going to Baojie Street. That night, the regiment attacked his house, killed people, and seized property. The next day, the bandits killed cattle and pigs in Galami and offered sacrifices to the Celestial Master. Many bandits from all over the place, mostly monkey-like Miao Yi, gathered and drew blood together. They advocated sending the false emperor to Beijing to ascend the throne, cutting off large and small roads. On the 11th, An Tingzhi, the captain of the Shuidao detachment of the Baojie regiment, saw that the bandits were too strong to resist, and led his team to Lengquan. When they were marching to Hongpo Jia, the Xiong bandit Peijin disarmed them all.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Process of Suppression <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The incident had been brewing for many days, and the authorities had not yet received a clear report from the area. On the 11th, the commander of the Independent Regiment stationed in Mengzi, Commander Li, heard the news and urgently ordered Battalion Commander Lu of the Second Battalion to lead a battalion of soldiers to arrive at Lengquan overnight. At 9:00 AM on the morning of the 12th, the bandits gathered more than a thousand people, divided into eight routes, shouting and attacking Lengquan. Battalion Commander Lu led his troops to meet them head-on. By 4:00 PM, the bandits had been defeated and fled to the surrounding mountains. Dozens of bandits were killed. On that day, because the mountain shapes were complex, they did not pursue them thoroughly and temporarily stationed in Lengquan, reporting to Commander Li to send reinforcements to search and suppress them. Upon receiving the report, Commander Li personally led Battalion Commander He of the Second Battalion and two companies of soldiers to Lengquan on the 14th to plan the suppression and appeasement affairs. Zhou, a member of the County Party Department, and Wan Zhu, the deputy director of the Construction Bureau, also went with them to promote appeasement. On the 15th, Commander Li sent two platoons of soldiers to search and suppress in the nearby areas, capturing bandits who had turned against the government. On the 16th, he summoned the township chiefs and gentry of the district for talks, and decided to focus on appeasement work, issuing a notice to appease the displaced people and asking them to return to farming as soon as possible. Those who followed the orders would be treated leniently and would not be investigated. Those who caught bandit leaders who surrendered would be heavily rewarded. On the 17th, he sent the entire Second Battalion to clear and suppress the bandit nests in Shuishui Ke Galami and Sitang, and the bandits chose to hide in the valleys and resist stubbornly. Many bandits were killed, and many guns, cattle, and horses were seized. Niu's brother, Niu San, was captured. One officer and soldier were killed and one was injured. On the 18th, they returned to Lengquan at the same time. The magistrate of Pingbian County also telegraphed asking for troops. On the 19th, Battalion Commander He led two companies of soldiers, the overall moral of the new, to suppress and console them.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Aftermath Work <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The wisdom of the Yi and Miao people is shallow and ignorant, stubbornly resistant to change. A few unscrupulous elements instigate them from within, causing unrest. If we do not appease them and instead only engage in suppression, it will increase our power without conferring virtue. It is said that eight or nine out of ten of the miscellaneous troops are not rebels, and only a few are the masterminds. If we try to wipe them out completely, then the foolish will only become sacrifices, and the ringleaders may not submit, which will not help the situation in reality.</p>
<p>Chief Li also advocated focusing on appeasement and making suppression secondary. Therefore, at 12:00 noon on the 21st, he convened a mass meeting of the people, attended by more than 400 people. Chief Li first gave a speech, outlining the following points: (1) The Han and Yi people must unite as one. (2) The district chiefs and neighborhood heads must use special methods to arrest criminals such as Niu Wanzhe. (3) Those who return the seized cattle and horses will be allowed to return to their occupations and live in peace. The captured firearms will be sent to the district office for the use of the local defense. (4) Those who followed the rebels will be given a chance to reform, and their past will be pardoned. (5) When the propaganda teams go to distant places, each village must guarantee protection and assist the government's communications.</p>
<p>Then, Committee Members Liang and Zhou discussed the need to eliminate boundaries between the Han and Yi people, promote equality and mutual assistance, the key points of propaganda for the current departure of the propaganda teams, and the importance of focusing on the baojia system to achieve social stability. The meeting adjourned at 3:00 p.m.</p>
<p>That evening, people from various villages came to collect their cattle, horses, wooden combs, and other items. They also came to submit repentance letters and seek pardon. All were soothed and dismissed by Chief Li. On the 21st, Chief Li ordered the 5th Company to stay in Lengquan to protect the farmers' autumn harvest. The remaining troops returned to Meng along with the seal. (October [Day])</p>
<p>Four-Province (Sichuan, Hunan, Guizhou, Guangxi) Military Encirclement and Suppression of He and Xiao's Remnant Bandits</p>
<p>He's Fake Division Commander Guangdong Sheng Was Killed; Xiao's Bandits, Badly Hit, Fled to Minjiachang and Other Places</p>
<p>Yingkou Correspondence: He Long and Su Ke's bandits attempted to enter Sichuan by separate routes to join forces with Xu Xiangqian's remnant bandits. They have been surrounded and suppressed by the troops of Sichuan, Hunan, Guizhou, and Guangxi provinces, and are now trapped. The Sichuan Bandit Suppression Headquarters reported to the Han on the 23rd, detailing the progress of the suppression. The report stated that, according to the telegram from the Da Brigade of the Chen Division, our army had indeed killed He's fake 7th Division Commander Guangdong Sheng in the battle of Shazichang. According to captured bandits, after Sheng's death, the bandits were fierce and difficult to fight. He was seriously wounded, and the fake 21st Regiment Commander Lai Ting was promoted to replace him. The remaining bandits fled to Xiangganxi and Jiaojiawan. Sheng's bandits were routed by the Hunan and Guangxi armies near Shiqian. Some fled to Minjiachang, Jiangkou, and others to Wanren Mountain. The various armies are still encircling and suppressing them. (23rd)</p>

<p>The Tobacco Prohibition Committee Reissues Licenses</p>
<p>The issuance of smoking cessation licenses to smokers by the Tobacco Prohibition Committee of this county was completed at the end of September. The number of smokers who received licenses in the county totaled six thousand and sixty-six, which is quite different from the original registered number. This was for the sake of providing relief before the deadline. To prevent these registered but unlicensed smokers from facing legal penalties, it was decided to reissue licenses from the 25th of this month until the end of the month. The registration forms were retrieved and distributed to the district offices, ordering them to issue the licenses nearby. When smokers receive their licenses, they must clearly state their age, appearance, etc., to show solemnity. Those who have not registered but request a license may not be approved.</p>

<p>Police and Bandits Exchange Fire, Hostage Escapes Danger</p>
<p>Shao Deyi, a resident of Hongjiatan Yingaobang, was kidnapped on the 9th of this month by a group of bandits. The bandits broke into his house, entered, and took him away. Later, the Shao family received a letter from the bandits demanding 10,000 yuan. Because the county's security force discovered the bandits' location near Wuzhen, the force, led by Team Leader Huang Yao, together with the police force, led by Inspector Chen Zhefu of the Public Security Bureau, traveled by Xinming transport to Wuzhen Zhongtangfang. First, Shao's relative led two people carrying fake money to negotiate the ransom. When the bandits came, a fierce battle broke out. The bandit Zhou Fusheng, 52 years old, was captured alive. At the same time, Shao seized the opportunity to escape. The bandit is now being escorted by the county government to be interrogated.</p>

<p>Drug Dealer Executed</p>
<p>The Public Security Bureau of this county, on August 2nd of this year, acting on a secret order from the Department of Civil Affairs, arrested Feng A'ren (61 years old), who was selling drug pills, at Feng Chang's cigarette and paper shop at No. 37 Zhijie Street, West Gate. Sixty-one empty boxes for drug pills, ten bags of Yunshi, and smoking paraphernalia were confiscated. Zhu Gengsheng, an accomplice in selling drug pills, was also arrested in Huocheng Lane. After the bureau's investigation, the case was transferred to the County Tobacco Prohibition Association and then to the Zhenjiang Garrison Headquarters. Ren Lian, the chief of the military law department, interrogated the case and determined that Feng A'ren had committed the crime of violating Article 2 of the Provisional Regulations on the Strict Prohibition of Highly Addictive Drugs and sentenced him to death. Zhu Gengsheng had also committed the crime of violating the same regulations and should be sentenced to life imprisonment. However, considering his ignorance, the court decided to apply Article 14, Article 44, Item 1, Article 77, and Article 80, Item 2 of the same regulations, reducing the sentence by half and sentencing him to eight years of imprisonment. The case was submitted to the Nanchang Camp for review and approval. Chiang Kai-shek approved the case and ordered that the two criminals, Feng and Zhu, be returned to the county government of this county for execution. Yesterday (15th) morning at 9:00 a.m., County Magistrate Yan presided over the case and ordered Feng A'ren to be brought to the court to confirm his identity. He was then tied up and taken to the South School Field for execution by firing squad.</p>

<p>Drug Dealers</p>
<p>Yang Chuan'er and Zhao Shijun Executed</p>
<p>Yang Chuan'er, a major seller of drug pills, previously operated a Yunshi thread shop in Hualong Lane. The Public Security Bureau sent police to search his home. Yang himself heard the news and escaped, leaving only his accomplice, who was immediately sent to the court for trial. Subsequently, the court and the Public Security Bureau immediately issued a warrant for Yang Chuan'er's arrest. To avoid the authorities' attention and to evade punishment, his family falsely reported his death to the county court. In August of this year, the Public Security Bureau, based on information from the Huzhou branch, arrested Zhao Shijun, a seller of drug pills. During the preliminary hearing, Zhao confessed that all the drug pills were purchased from Yang Chuan'er at No. 3 Xichengjiaobu. Director Xu Baoguang of the bureau immediately sent officers to take Zhao Shijun to the address for investigation and arrest. As a result, Yang Chuan'er and the drug-making equipment were seized and brought to the bureau for interrogation. Yang confessed without hesitation and said that there was human evidence and that he was awaiting execution. Both Zhao and Yang were handed over to the county, and then to the Zhenjiang Garrison Headquarters for trial. After the trial, it was confirmed that they were guilty, and they were returned to the original county for imprisonment. On the 24th, the county government received an order from the Provincial Garrison Headquarters, relayed by the Nanchang Camp, approving the death sentence. That afternoon, police were dispatched to extract Yang and Zhao from prison, verify their identities, and take them to the Xiwudun execution ground for execution by firing squad.</p>

<p>Outside the West Gate, on the street of Pengbu, west of the second section, next to the river in front of the Jiusi Fire Station, there were several fishing boats moored. The boat owners were two brothers, the older brother named Wang Quansheng (50 years old) and the younger brother named Wang Quanbao (46 years old). Each had a wife, children, and an elderly mother, Ding (70+ years old), all living on the boats. Early the day before yesterday, the brothers and their wives each took their catch of fish and shrimp to sell near the Tianhou Palace market on the Dashi Bridge. Because the two brothers fought over customers, they started fighting. Wang Quansheng kicked Wang Quanbao in the lower abdomen, causing him to fall and get injured. Wang Quansheng was brought to the 9th Precinct of the Public Security Bureau and was fined 5 yuan. Wang Quanbao was ordered to return for treatment. After Quanbao returned to the boat, he was in severe abdominal pain and went to the Xiongbei Hospital for treatment. Surgeons such as Chen Fu and others were consulted, but to no avail. Yesterday morning, he died. Quansheng, seeing that he had caused the disaster, immediately fled. The 4th Precinct of the Public Security Bureau learned of the incident and immediately sent police to investigate. Since the perpetrator was on the run, the police took the deceased's mother, Ding, and wife, Fang, to the station for questioning. The 27th Tuzheng Chen Zizhao of the area reported the incident to the local branch court. An inspector was dispatched to examine the body and confirmed that he had died from injuries sustained before death. The inspector ordered the family of the deceased to collect the body and await the arrest of the perpetrator.</p>

A fierce battle ensued. After six hours, the official soldiers seized seven bandit ships and destroyed one, killing more than 100 bandits. The fishermen were pleased. On the 10th, more than ten bandits in plain clothes suddenly arrived at the house of Wu Qianmao, a villager in the 8th Township of Juegang, hiding firearms in sacks. The head of the township and the director of the sentry station, Wang, received the news and immediately dispatched more than 20 people from the 8th and 10th sentry stations to arrest them. The bandits fled upon hearing the news. After chasing them for more than a mile to the south, four people, Shi Lixue, Zhang Changli, Yao He, and Liu Zhu, were arrested and sent to the county for strict investigation.</p>

When Chen refused, they shouted and rushed into the house, overturning boxes and cabinets and searching at will. When the villagers learned of this, they beat gongs and gathered the crowd to confront the refugees. Seeing that the situation was unfavorable, the refugees left in formation. After checking, it was found that more than 1,000 yuan in cash, clothes, ornaments, etc. were lost. The incident has been reported to the county government for investigation.</p>

<p>Huge Amount of Smuggled Opium Discovered on EWO Steamer in Wuhu</p>
<p>The British-owned EWO steamer, Jih Wo, which operates on the Yangtze River, sailed from Hankou a few days ago. Someone secretly transported a large amount of smuggled opium onto the ship and hid it in the hold, intending to unload it at a certain port downstream. However, the plan was discovered. Three people abandoned the ship and came to Wuhu the day before. Li Xiping, the Wuhu Special Commissioner of the Northern Jiangsu Inspectorate, was tipped off and signed a guarantee that if the information was false, he would offer one person to be punished with death. Li specially dispatched a commissioner to investigate, because the amount of smuggled opium was too large. In addition to asking the Wuhu Special Tax Office to send police to assist, he also went to the Customs and discussed with Customs Commissioner Lauton. When the ship arrived in Wuhu, Li, accompanied by the new Customs River Patrol Director Locke, led customs officers and police to board the ship. Guided by informants, they searched the ship and discovered a large iron plate in the bottom of the coal bunker, behind which there was another door. There were many footprints, and based on the coal loading situation, there should not be many people other than the stoker coming and going to this place. Judging the size of the footprints, it was decided to open the door to investigate. As soon as the door was opened, stacks of sacks were displayed before their eyes. At that moment, a stoker took the opportunity to throw a cloth bag wrapped in oilcloth into the river and fled. Therefore, the River Patrol Director and Commissioner Li ordered the police officers to check the contents of the sacks and confirmed that they were the reported unstamped smuggled opium, a total of forty-seven pieces, with more than seven additional pieces, each weighing about ninety pounds, totaling more than forty stones. At the current opium price, it is worth as much as 120,000 yuan. In addition to sending personnel to monitor the unloading, the shipowner was contacted and asked to hand over the smugglers and suspicious stokers for thorough investigation. Subsequently, the stoker was handed over, and the ship was allowed to sail. The captured smuggled opium and suspects have been taken to the office of the Li Special Commissioner for investigation.

Mr. Wang is a world-renowned scholar, a former responsible official in the government, and a veteran comrade in the Kuomintang. Therefore, he visited comrades from all sides to exchange opinions in order to seek national unity. In the past, comrades in and out of the government often had misunderstandings due to estrangement and blamed each other. Since Mr. Wang conveyed the opinions of all parties to each other, misunderstandings can be cleared up. As for whether Mr. Wang will go south again, I have not heard of it.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Silver Tax Increase Issue <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>There have been many rumors since the silver tax increase, saying that the government is implementing centralized cash collection, inflating currency, reducing the fineness of silver coins, and implementing the gold standard. Minister Kung denied this, saying that the implementation of the silver tax increase was originally to prevent the large-scale outflow of silver. The intention is very clear. Therefore, in addition to the prescribed tax rate, a balancing tax is added, which increases or decreases with the price at any time, so that merchants have no profit to be made. Rumors such as currency inflation and reducing the fineness of silver coins are all speculations from the outside world. Paper money in various countries is all issued by the government, and silver is all collected in the treasury. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the fineness of the standard currency and inflate the currency with a single order. Silver coins in our country circulate in the market, and in fact, they cannot be collected from the people and then changed to reduce the silver content. Moreover, the silver content of issued silver coins is stipulated by law, so how can it be changed casually?</p>

It was agreed that in addition to fully recovering the 2 million yuan worth of bonds issued by the province in previous years, a face value of 12.5 million yuan would be pledged to various banks at a 60% discount, totaling 7.5 million yuan. At the same time, as a result of Director Zhao's negotiations with Central Bank President H.H. Kung, the Central Bank is also willing to pledge 1 million yuan at half price for 500,000 yuan. The remaining 4.5 million yuan will be raised by Jiangsu Province by soliciting 2 million yuan from local gentry and merchants, and 2.5 million yuan will be allocated for river engineering construction and will be issued or pledged by the River Engineering Bureau itself.</p>

However, it has not been decided whether each bank will sign a joint or separate contract. The interest rate is set at 8%, and the term is undecided.</p>

<p>Unrelated to Japanese Official Investigation</p>
<p>On the 24th of this month, this newspaper published a news item about negotiations for road construction beyond concessions. Some readers were quite mistaken, thinking that the renewed discussion of this old case was due to the visit of Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials to Shanghai for investigation. However, the official statement from the Public Works Department only stated that the negotiations for this case had been reopened, and did not mention whether Japanese officials had come to Shanghai or not. This can be clarified by the news released by various newspapers on the 25th.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Relief Association Asks Ministry of Finance to Approve Draft of Disaster Relief Preparation Regulations <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Drought Relief Association for Various Provinces, due to the severe drought in various provinces, telegraphed Minister Kong yesterday, requesting that the regulations on the Management Committee for Disaster Relief Reserve Funds and other implementing regulations be quickly reviewed and promulgated. The original text is as follows: "To Minister Kong of the Nanjing Ministry of Finance: The drought in various provinces this year is extremely severe, and relief is urgently needed. We, while we still have a breath, cannot delay relief. Therefore, we have organized a Drought Relief Association for various provinces to do our best to alleviate the disaster. We also hope that you, as the appointed president, will bring happiness to the victims. We have long been aware that floods and droughts are common, and disaster relief is always difficult. Preparation is essential. At this time of national difficulty, whenever a disaster occurs, both the government and society are concerned. Even with every effort, the results are still limited. The victims cannot wait for relief, and will inevitably resort to fleeing. The cash from the countryside is flowing into the cities, and the concentration in the cities is flowing overseas. Production is failing, and income is exceeding expenditures. Furthermore, unrest is increasing, and taxes are increasing daily. The economy of the countryside is collapsing, and the foundation of society is gradually shaking. As the saying goes, 'If the people are not sufficient, how can the ruler be sufficient?' Looking ahead, our worries are endless. We have found that the Central Relief Committee previously presented to the National Government the Disaster Relief Reserve System, which is used in Japan and the United States, to formulate the Disaster Relief Reserve Fund Law, stipulating that the central government should set aside one percent of its total expenditure annually, and the provinces two percent, as a disaster relief reserve fund, to be used exclusively for disaster relief and prevention, included in the budget, and not to be diverted. The Legislative Yuan formulated the Disaster Relief Reserve Fund Law on October 28 of the 19th year, so that the country's ability to provide disaster relief can be strengthened in peacetime, and the losses from disasters in various places will be restored in a short time. We hope that the implementation will be accelerated. We have heard that the regulations on the Management Committee and the implementing regulations were drafted by the Relief Committee of the Ministry of Interior after the promulgation of the law, and sent to the Ministry for detailed review, but have not yet been implemented. We deeply appreciate your compassion and concern, and believe that you will pay special attention to detailed planning. We sincerely request that you approve the draft regulations as soon as possible, and request implementation, and order all provinces to organize in accordance with the law. This would be like removing firewood and bending chimneys, allowing the government to make great plans for the years to come, and allowing us to avoid future failures. As the saying goes, 'When benevolent people are in power, there will be no starving people in the country.' We look forward to your favorable response. Xu Shiying, Wang Zhengting, Wang..., Wu Tiecheng, Chu Fucheng, Wen Lanting, Zhang Yin, Du..., Wang Xiaofan, and others kowtow together."</p>

<p>On the 25th of this month, Zhou Daoyu, Ye Jingqiu, Chen Zeqing, Huang Yi'ou, Shen Zuru, Chen Heting, Li..., and other standing committee members of the Hunan Sojourners Association in Shanghai, stated that the drought in Hunan Province has affected as many as sixty-two counties. The severity of the damage is no less than that of Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Gansu provinces. They proposed two relief measures: 1. Send telegrams to the Executive Yuan and relevant ministries and commissions, requesting that work relief and agricultural relief be expedited, and send letters to fellow provincial associations and charitable organizations in various places, requesting that urgent relief be sought and provided. Also, report to the National Government Relief Committee for review, and to the Hunan Provincial Government and the Hunan Drought Relief Association for reference. 2. This association is only responsible for appealing for relief and does not handle donations. All relief funds and materials from various places, sectors, and individuals should be sent directly to the Hunan Drought Relief Committee for verification, in order to simplify the process and ensure prudence. These points were unanimously approved and will be implemented soon.</p>

<p>The Hubei Tongshan Township Association in Shanghai established a committee to collect donations for flood and drought relief. Yesterday, they received a public telegram from the Hubei Tongshan Disaster Relief and Famine Prevention Committee and the Tongshan County Chamber of Commerce, which said: "President Wu, Vice President Guan, Vice President Wang, and all standing committee members of the Hubei Township Association in Shanghai's committee for raising donations for flood and drought relief: We received a letter from Shanghai literati yesterday, informing us that you are concerned about our homeland and sympathize with the disastrous situation in our province. We are raising funds for relief, and we are deeply grateful. The disaster victims throughout the province are grateful. Since May of this year, there has been no rain, lasting for more than four months. After July, we suffered a severe drought, resulting in withered crops and no harvest. The mountain land is dry, and no seeds have been planted. The county's harvest is less than one-tenth of the previous year. Furthermore, the bandits have not been suppressed, and they are robbing at any time, causing extreme panic over food. The provincial government and the provincial relief committee have surveyed the area and classified it as a first-class disaster area, providing emergency relief twice, totaling six thousand yuan. Although we have tried our best to provide relief, there are too many disaster victims to help everyone. In addition, after the robbery by the bandits, the houses are empty. Winter is approaching, and snow will fall soon. Not only will people be emaciated, but they will also be cold and hungry, with no way to seek help. We hope that you will have mercy and provide relief, so that the poor can be grateful. We send this telegram and await your decision. Xia Fengyuan, Director of the Tongshan County Disaster Relief and Famine Prevention Committee; Chen Kecheng, Chairman of the Tongshan County Chamber of Commerce."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Branch of the World Red Swastika Society released information about the disaster situation in Wuwei County, Anhui, stating that the disaster and the suffering of the people are unprecedented. Since the collapse of the river embankment in the 20th year of the Republic of China, the flood has caused disasters, and livestock and fields have been almost completely submerged. The morale of the people has not yet recovered, and the situation is dire. Unexpectedly, after the flood, there was a poor harvest, followed by drought. This year, in the summer, the drought devastated the crops, and the streams and ponds were dry. All cotton, sesame, beans, sweet potatoes, and other crops have no harvest to speak of, and even the areas for drinking water are dry. The dry farmland covers more than 229,400 mu, and the dry small embankments and high slopes cover more than 142,500 mu. The total affected farmland is more than 371,300 mu, and the affected population is more than 200,000. They are starving and waiting to be fed. It is unbearable to hear that some are too hungry to go out, some fathers abandon their sons and husbands abandon their wives, and some sell their children to survive. There are even those who die of starvation along the way. It is unbearable to see. We hope that kind people and philanthropists will show compassion and provide relief funds and food to the disaster area, so that the dying people can be rescued and be grateful.</p>

<p>With a Hundred Stormtroopers</p>
<p>According to yesterday's Japanese Mainichi Shimbun, German nationals in Shanghai recently established the Shanghai branch of the National Socialist Party. Two individuals, Haginge and Laurens, are responsible for issuing the following statement: The Shanghai branch of the National Socialist Party was originally established in April 1932 by Mr. Hazainel. At that time, there were only ten party members. Now there are 350 party members, including 25 ordinary female party members, 90 members of the Hitler Youth, and 100 stormtroopers, all under the command of Mr. Pohl, the Minister of the Overseas Department of the home country. There are some members with Cantonese nationality in the party. Similar branches will be established in Tianjin, Peiping, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Hankou, Dalian, and other places. The purpose of our party is solely to unite overseas compatriots and organize them in the same way as in the home country. All party members are not allowed to interfere in the politics and economy of the country in which they reside.</p>

<p>No Shortfall in Collections This Year</p>
<p>According to the report on tax revenue published by the Public Works Department this Friday, the total land tax collected up to the end of September was 4,671,638.46 yuan for the first nine months of this year. Compared with last year, a total of 5,793,357.51 yuan was collected up to the end of September last year. The difference between the two numbers seems to be significant. The reason is that after the revaluation of land prices last year, in order to take care of taxpayers, they were allowed to pay 80% of the increased amount in the second half of the year, but it had to be paid before the end of September to be valid. Therefore, more than 3 million yuan was collected in September alone last year. This year, only more than 190,000 yuan was collected in September. At the end of September last year, the outstanding amount was only 112,000 yuan. At the end of September this year, the outstanding amount was still 2,341,000 yuan.</p>

About 700 to 800 people attended the ceremony. After the ceremony, Mr. Wang Kui'sheng first reported on the establishment of the public education implementation site, saying that due to the limited time, it had to be simple, but we will never be shy or hesitant because of the lack of material preparations. We deeply hope that all elders, brothers, sisters, and colleagues from the office can have spiritual communication, gather together day and night, and jointly plan the improvement of various undertakings in Gaoqiao. Next, Mr. Lian Yousan, a cadre from the Rural Economic Department of the association, reported on the association's work plan, deciding to first organize three items: loan improvement, seed cooperation, and cooperative society, in order to help the local villagers obtain a safer life in the entire production process with the help of the Improvement Association. Then, Mr. Yao Huiquan, the director of the Rural Service Department of the China Vocational Education Society, who was hired by the association, reported on the actual situation and prospects of rural improvement in Xugong Bridge, Shanren Bridge, and Zhaojiatang, and explained the purpose of the public education implementation site, which is to enable everyone in Gaoqiao to be literate, physically strong, have good habits, and jointly seek welfare for the area. Mr. Huang Renzhi's speech was mainly about how the staff of the Rural Improvement Association came to serve with great determination and ambition. Whenever any difficulties or problems arise in the area or in the family, the Improvement Association staff will do their best to assist in every way. Credit loans will be launched soon, hoping to solve the economic problems, and then we will study literacy, exercise the body, and the functions of the Improvement Association are unlimited, depending on how you elders use them. Finally, Mr. Yin Yucun, a respected elder in the area, gave a speech, hoping that Gaoqiao can become a national model village under the joint efforts of the Improvement Association staff and the villagers. After the speeches, there were performances by the Gaoqiao Elementary School Health Office and the Rising Sun Elementary School. In the evening at 7:30, a movie was shown (production education movie - planting cotton). More than 1,000 villagers came to watch the movie, which was an unprecedented event in Gaoqiao.</p>

<p>Illegal Cooperatives Will Be Strictly Banned</p>
<p>Establishment Permitted Only When Strictly Following the Cooperative Law</p>
<p>The establishment of cooperatives was originally intended to benefit the public, achieve mutual assistance, and jointly seek the interests of the members. However, recently, a few unscrupulous people have used the name of cooperatives to operate like ordinary stores. In order to rectify the situation, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs previously issued an order urging all cooperatives to register. Over time, more than fifty or sixty have registered. However, in fact, the number is definitely more than this. The registration period has now expired. Those with pure purposes and legal organizations will be approved and guided by the Bureau of Social Affairs. Others who use the name of cooperatives for private gain will be strictly banned to avoid abuses. The Bureau also stipulates that the Cooperative Law has nine chapters, including general rules for establishment, members' shares and surpluses, directors, supervisors and staff, meetings, dissolution and liquidation, cooperative unions, penalties, and supplementary rules. In order to facilitate agriculture, industry, finance, and mutual assistance among members, it is possible to establish production, consumption, and disease, disaster, life and death insurance cooperatives. The responsibilities are divided into three types: limited, unlimited, and guaranteed. There must be a minimum of seven people, and there must be no corrupt behavior. The Bureau of Social Affairs now also issues a notice that all organizations wishing to establish cooperatives must strictly comply with the regulations before they are allowed to be established.</p>

<p>Miss Wang Xiaomeng, of Hangzhou County, graduated from Shanghai University in the twentieth year of the Republic (1931). Last summer, she went to the United States and studied at the University of Southern California. This summer, she obtained a Master's degree in Journalism. The university's granting of a Master's degree in Journalism began with Miss Wang, making her the only student at the university since its founding to receive this honorary degree. Her graduation thesis is titled "A Comparison of the History of Journalism in China and the United States." The thesis is now listed in the university's new medical collection.</p>
<p>Miss Wang also excels in sociology and has studied with the famous American sociologist Mr. Bogardus, conducting investigations into the life and status of overseas Chinese in the Green Core region of the Rocky Mountains in the United States. Furthermore, she frequently publishes papers in American sociological journals.</p>
<p>Wang Xiaomeng</p>
<p>While Miss Wang was in the United States, the Los Angeles Daily News also frequently published her translated works. Miss Wang always aimed to promote national friendship and raise the status of Chinese women. Because many foreigners were ignorant of Chinese culture and history, often regarding China as an ancient country lacking brilliance and isolated from the new era, Miss Wang did her best to promote China through this newspaper. At the same time, she also gave speeches at various women's groups and literary societies, always receiving great acclaim. Therefore, the Green Core Daily News once wrote, "Miss Wang Xiaomeng is the new China."</p>
<p>Miss Wang also enjoyed socializing with people from all walks of life and was friendly with several famous American movie stars and directors. Hollywood often saw her presence throughout the year. In addition, Miss Wang frequently visited both journalism and academic circles. After leaving the United States, Miss Wang went to Europe to study the European newspaper industry and customs. She visited Italy, France, England, Germany, Belgium, and Switzerland. While in Italy, Miss Wang also studied Fascism and published an article in an English newspaper in Shanghai about the shortcomings and applications of this ideology. She also studied Italian. It is now heard that Miss Wang has boarded an Italian liner to return home and is expected to arrive in Shanghai in early November.</p>
<p>Miss Wang's return to China will not only bring honor to China's women's circles but will also contribute to China's newspaper industry.</p>

Second, to introduce all books and scholars, ancient and modern, to the reading public, and to collect, collate, and verify criticisms and records of books and authors to provide convenience to the academic community. Third, to compile a Chinese encyclopedia and other academic reference books to facilitate knowledge acquisition and foster a love of reading. Since its establishment, the founder, Mr. Yang Jialuo, has donated funds totaling 20,700 yuan. The books compiled and printed include Yang's own "Dictionary of the Four Libraries," "Book Yearbook," "Supplement to the Book Yearbook," "Bibliography," "Dictionary of Books," "Portraits of Famous Figures of the Republic," "Dictionary of Qing Dynasty Figures," "Dictionary of Chinese Literature," "Dictionary of the Confucian Classics," "Simplified Anthology of Early Tang Poetry," and "Records of Ink Sea Classics," "Eulogy to Mr. Gao Qifeng," "Paintings of Miss Zhang Kunyi," etc. Each of Yang's ten books contains between two and three million words, truly a monumental work of the Chinese academic community. The total number of words is over twenty million, equivalent to the weight of the twenty-four histories which contained over three thousand and two hundred volumes. The Chairman of the National Government and the heads of various ministries, provincial governors, and directors of education have all presented inscriptions. The education departments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Shandong, Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Yunnan, Chahar, and Suiyuan provinces, as well as the municipal education bureaus of Nanjing, Beiping, and other cities, have ordered that these books be provided for reference. There have been over forty such orders. Professor Zhang Liangsi of England, Professor Asher Joel of the United States, Professor Alick of Russia, and Professor Jitsui Keishu of Japan, all renowned scholars in the world, have written lengthy criticisms published in magazines. The books compiled by the Editorial Office have been successively published and have already attracted serious attention from academic circles both at home and abroad. Therefore, it has been decided to publicly exhibit the manuscripts and materials accumulated over the years to seek criticism from the public. The preparations for this exhibition are now underway, and it is scheduled to open in December. Among the exhibits, the following are said to be the most noteworthy: First, the manuscripts of the published "Dictionary of the Four Libraries," "Book Yearbook," "Dictionary of Qing Dynasty Figures," "Dictionary of Chinese Literature," and "Dictionary of Confucian Classics," totaling over seven hundred volumes.

Fourth, over one hundred volumes of drafts and over one hundred volumes of manuscripts of the "Early Anthology of Tang Poetry," a portion of which has been selected and printed.

<p>Public Prosecution Case After the Bankruptcy of the China Industrial Bank to be Heard Today</p>
<h3 id="e150">The Case Before the Bankruptcy is Still Tried Separately, and Subsequent Suits for Outstanding Loans Will Be Included in the Public Prosecution <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>After the bankruptcy of the China Industrial Bank, the manager, Bao Yuan, absconded with funds in advance. Lu Xihou, the managing director, was reported by the Japanese firm Mitsui &amp; Co. to the General Patrol Room for the crime of fraud and breach of trust, and a public prosecution was filed with the First Special District Court in accordance with the law. Lu was arrested and detained. Subsequently, creditors of the bank, such as Qian Zunmin, filed criminal private prosecutions against Lu and Qin for fraud and embezzlement. However, the First Special Court held that since the person in charge of the bank's overdue debts was publicly prosecuted by the patrol room in accordance with the law, all creditors of the bank who wished to litigate could report to the patrol room for consolidation and handling, and there was no need to file separate private prosecutions. The day before yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui summoned the private plaintiffs, Qian Zunmin, and ordered the defendant Lu Xihou, who was in custody, to be brought to court, after announcing this proposition, the private prosecution of Qian and others was immediately dismissed by the court, and they were ordered to report the facts of the defendant's embezzlement and fraud to the patrol room and await public prosecution, which has been recorded in this newspaper. It is now learned that the measures announced by the First Special Court apply to general creditors who wish to file private prosecutions after the bank's bankruptcy. If the private prosecution case was filed before the bank's bankruptcy, it will still be tried separately and will not be included in the public prosecution case. Therefore, the private prosecution dismissed by Judge Liu the day before yesterday afternoon was only Qian Zunmin's case against Lu Xihou. Shen Bingwen's lawsuit against Lu鋧hou and Bao Yuan was abandoned. Yi Sheng Wheel’s Kidnapping of Li Xiting Escaped Danger</p>

<p>The Nanhua liner Yisheng of Yihe Foreign Firm was looted by pirates in Fuzhou Ocean in March of this year, and six passengers were taken away. More than half a year has passed, and the kidnapped ticket has not yet escaped. All the Hakkas are poor merchants who are unable to raise money for redemption, causing them to be trapped in the bandit's den for a long time. Yesterday, we received accurate news that the bandits had released one person and ordered him to contact the family members of other ticket holders. The investigation situation of all parties is reported as follows. All six votes were stolen. The hijacking on the Yisheng ship took place in</p>
<p>July seven years. On March 12, there were two pirates.</p>
<p>Twelve people, mostly from Huizhou, robbed more than 5,000 yuan on the wheel, and when they were leaving, they took six passengers on board and fled to Dapu North. These six people are ordinary merchants and have no property. Therefore, since the kidnapping, their families have never contacted them, and it has been seven months and ten days.</p>
<p>Family rescue. After this case occurred, I didn’t know about the six.</p>
<p>The people were taken by the bandits to what place, and there was no way to know their whereabouts, so they let it go. After about three months, the bandits sent a letter, which was written by the kidnapped ticket, to a hotel in Shanghai, asking the kidnapped ticket's family to contact Hong Kong. At that time, the bandit's nest seemed to be in the mountains under the jurisdiction of Leizhou. At that time, Shanghai sent someone to 淃 to inquire about the whereabouts of the six people in order to rescue them.</p>
<p>The pirates demanded a huge amount of money. The representative who was responsible for rescuing the tickets arrived in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The pirates did not have a representative to meet them. Only the bandit leader Tian ordered the ticket to send a second letter to the contact person left in Hong Kong, indicating that the ransom price for the six people must be 100,000 yuan before they could be released. The representative in Hong Kong immediately reported by telegram that the family members did not have this ability, so he ordered to stop the contact and let the bandits tear up the tickets, indicating that they would never pay the ransom.</p>
<p>One person was released first. After this decision, it took another</p>
<p>It's been three months, and there has been no news. The bandits have investigated the family situation of the six people they kidnapped in detail. It was confirmed that Li Xiting, one of the kidnapped tickets, did not have a salary in the Shanghai customs declaration firm. This time, he was old and returned home and had no property. He had been released first. The bandit leader ordered him to collect ransom money from the families of all the tickets. The amount has been reduced. Once the money arrives, all can be released.</p>
<p>Starting the journey from Hong Kong to Shanghai. Li Xiting, who was released from the bandit's cave,</p>
<p>He has been sent to Hong Kong by the bandits.</p>
<p>Shanghai has received his telegram, which roughly said that the lives of Zhang Bozi and others who were kidnapped together have not been lost, and the bandits are willing to get a small ransom before they can be released. Li is now resting in Hong Kong for a few days, and he will come to Shanghai to report the details.</p>
<p>And Wang Yixuan’s case was not actually dismissed. Qian’s complaint was only submitted on Monday of this week, after Mitsui &amp; Co.’s accusation, and should be handled in the same way as Mitsui &amp; Co. Dismissing his private prosecution and ordering him to report to the police station so that the police station can file a public prosecution together. Shen’s private prosecution was filed before the bank went bankrupt. The facts among them were not without modification, and there was a clear distinction between the beginning and the end. Therefore, the court did not advocate the merger. However, only one of the three defendants in the case, Lu鋧hou, was brought to court the day before yesterday afternoon. The other two, Wang Yixuan and 棄Bao Yuan, were not summoned, and the trial could not begin. Judge Liu ordered to change the date and wait for further orders to summon the two defendants 弃and Wang to court for interrogation. As for the case publicly prosecuted by the police station, it will be handled by Judge Qian Hongye of the Criminal Court. It is now scheduled that Judge Qian will open the first criminal court for investigation this afternoon. If there are still people who want to sue for outstanding debts, they can bring evidence and report directly to the General Patrol Room, and there is still time.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Communications believes that foreign vessel inspection is of great importance to China's maritime rights. It previously instructed the Maritime Affairs Administration to implement the inspection. However, because this matter involved foreign affairs, it was quite complicated and has been delayed repeatedly. According to inquiries, the Ministry of Communications believes that Chinese vessel inspection has been implemented for a long time, and foreign vessel inspection needs to be implemented urgently. Therefore, it has consulted the Ministry of Finance to instruct the Customs to cooperate in handling it. It is now actively underway, and it is expected that effective measures will be taken in the near future to implement the inspection to safeguard China's maritime rights.</p>

<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation 24th District Branch previously received a letter from members of Songji Lane on Beijing Road, saying that the houses in the lane were managed by lawyer Tao Wuzhi, requesting that the landlord be persuaded to show compassion for the merchants' difficulties and automatically reduce rents to ease the burden. The landlord, deeply understanding the righteousness, has agreed to automatically reduce the rent by 15%, collecting 85% in real terms. The members were satisfied and have accepted. This shows that the reduction of rent in the lane is actually due to the support of lawyer Tao Wuzhi. Furthermore, the houses along Beijing Road on Shanxi Road (Qingjing Lane, which is now a three-story building) are owned by the Xing Renji accountant. Last year, the landlord, in view of the economic downturn, automatically reduced the rent by a certain amount. This year, due to economic bankruptcy, he reduced it by another 10% and changed it from yuan to foreign currency. Moreover, the newly built three-story building opposite the lane, with the city number, is managed by the British firm Dehe, and has also reduced the rent by 20%, collecting 80% in real terms. It is heard that some tenants have made similar requests to the landlords, and negotiations are underway. It is expected that there will be hope for the realization of a general rent reduction soon.</p>

<p>Zhang Shouci Actually Left a Farewell Letter</p>
<p>Zhang Shouci, a 33-year-old Ningbo native and teacher at the private pharmacy Rong務 Elementary School on Rongjia Road in the western city, lived with his wife and children in Shanghai. Zhang was kind and loyal, but his family burden was very heavy, and his monthly salary of thirty or forty yuan was not enough to make ends meet, resulting in a high debt. A few days ago, Zhang borrowed a 20-yuan check from a friend to pay his debts, but the check was returned when someone went to collect it. Therefore, Zhang was extremely anxious. On Monday of this week, he claimed to be going out to raise money and never returned. Until yesterday, the school principal, Chen Jiaoming, and family relatives received Zhang's suicide note, which was so tragic that they could not bear to read it. Now, the family members have been searching in all directions, hoping to rescue him before he dies.</p>

<p>Living Together Last Night, Facing Each Other in Court This Morning</p>
<p>The Wife Still Talks About Divorce This Time</p>
<p>Lawyer Cai Xiaobai, from Hangzhou, and Wu Xueli, the daughter of the famous fortune teller Wu Zhifen (deceased, from Changzhou), fell in love freely through friendship, and they became husband and wife. They lived together at 137 Mài 厺 and 藉羅 Road in the French Concession. Recently, due to differences of opinion, Cai believed that they could not live together, and first filed a lawsuit with the Second Special Court for mediation for divorce. Because the mediation failed, he formally filed a lawsuit. The court summoned them once, but because the defendant Wu Xueli did not arrive, the date was changed. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. This morning, he received another summons, and the defendant and his agent, lawyer Yao Junyu, reported on time. Not long after, the plaintiff Cai 晓bai also arrived at the court. They were all waiting for the trial in the lawyer's rest room. When the wife and wife met, they both smiled at each other. Several lawyers who were with them tried hard to persuade both parties to be friendly and not to divorce, but both parties did not give a definite indication. At 11:30 a.m., Judge Ma Yishu opened the seventh court and summoned both parties to court for continued trial. When Cai and Wu went to Caojiadu to buy paper and pens for the police station, they returned to the station and passed Bailinan Road, from east to west. Suddenly, a Japanese military truck sped forward from behind, and Jiang was too late to avoid it. Because of the injury, he died. Yesterday morning, the local guarantee officer Chen Liantang reported to the court, and the procurator Tang Rushui and the coroner Yi Zhiming were commissioned to inspect the body. After confirming that the death was due to the injury, he filled out the form and ordered the coffin to be buried in the afternoon. He ordered Zhang Kewu, a police officer at the Bailinan Road police station (the scene of the incident was about twenty door fronts away from the police station), Zhang Jingfan, the owner of the Jingxin cigarette paper shop at the station, and Guo Taibang, a passerby who witnessed the scene, to appear in court and asked them about the situation one by one. The officials ordered them to leave together and wait for instructions.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Liang Chengyu is Innocent <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>The Second Branch of the High Court Retries and Pronounces Judgment</p>
<p>Liang Chengyu, the former No. 2 Chinese detective of the General Patrol Room, was arrested and sent to court for stealing morphine and sentenced to six years and six months in prison. Later, the Patrol Room found that Liang had also committed the crimes of colluding with a gang to kidnap Chen Shifan and Li Huiqing for ransom in November 1919 and February 8, 1920. He was sued again in accordance with the law. The first trial found Liang guilty and sentenced him to death. Liang refused to accept the verdict and appealed. As a result, he still failed. He refused to accept the verdict again and appealed to the Supreme Court, believing that there were still doubts about the kidnapping case and returned it to the First Special Court for retrial. After the retrial, Liang Chengyu was sentenced to life imprisonment. However, Liang still refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court again, and his agent lawyer Hu Jue drafted the appeal. The appeal stated that the original trial had made mistakes in determining the facts and had no basis for taking evidence in the case of Liang Chengyu being accused of extorting ransom. The following two facts are also sufficient to prove Liang Chengyu's innocence: (1) The original trial was based on the testimony of Lu A根· Li Liansheng· Fang Liansheng, believing that it was the basis for the judgment. Regarding Lu A根 kidnapping Chen Shifan, referring to the original trial's Judgment No. 339, the description of Lu A恨 at the police station at that time, who was standing where, who got on the bus first, who was the driver, who was watching the ticket, and how many people were at the scene, was detailed and clear. The records of the court hearing before the case was judged were very clear. Who sees the fallen flowers and leaves with pity?</p>
<h3 id="e159">Madam Bao Shan Sues Zhu Jiaxiang for Abandoning Her After Seduction, Requests Termination of Relationship and Payment of Living Expenses <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Chen Aling, a young woman from Baoshan, recently filed a lawsuit in the local court against Zhu Jiaxiang (residing at No. 9, Beiyao Bridge, Jiaozhou Road) for taking advantage of her, seducing and abandoning her, damaging her reputation and body, and committing assault. She requests termination of the relationship and compensation for all mental and material damages suffered. Her statement roughly states that the plaintiff is a weak, unsophisticated country girl who, despite being over twenty years old, is still unmarried. Last year, she was persuaded by the defendant's deceptive words, claiming that his wife had already passed away. They went together to the Oriental Hotel, where he forcibly committed indecent acts. The plaintiff, in her shock, realized she had been deceived. However, she was unable to resist and had to submit to his adulterous acts. They then lived together. Later, she discovered that the defendant's wife was still alive and that he was violent and often beat her. On August 23 of this year, the plaintiff's mother took her back home. For self-preservation, she has no choice but to terminate the relationship. However, the defendant's fraudulent actions have caused her to lose her reputation and integrity. Like a withered flower and fallen leaf, who will pity her? Facing a bleak future, life is extremely difficult. She requests living expenses of three thousand yuan. The plaintiff holds assets of three hundred and eighty-nine yuan, etc. The defendant, Zhu Jiaxiang, hired lawyer Pan Zhensheng to file a defense, roughly stating that the defendant is approaching middle age and, for the sake of continuing his lineage, agreed on November 13, 1933, to take the plaintiff as a concubine. He sent her two hundred yuan in gifts, a gold bracelet, two gold rings, and a pair of gold bangles. The original date for her to enter his household was December 26. Later, a Jin Zhuolun appeared and objected, claiming that taking a concubine was too cheap and that an additional six hundred yuan was required. The defendant had no choice but to send the full amount. Unexpectedly, after only a little over half a year, the plaintiff was taken away by her mother, requesting fulfillment of the agreement. He refutes the plaintiff's lawsuit and requests a judgment ordering them to live together, etc. The case was heard yesterday by Judge Xu. The plaintiff testified about the previous events. The defendant did not appear; only lawyer Pan represented him in court. After the defense was presented, the judge ordered an adjournment for further hearing.</p>
<p>Still smiling, they entered the court and stood in their positions as plaintiff and defendant. At the same time, relatives and friends of both parties, as well as lawyers and court staff, also attended the hearing, making the courtroom very crowded. The judge first asked the plaintiff, Cai Xiaobai, about the object of the lawsuit. Cai answered that it was based on Articles 1052, Section 3, 4, and 6 of the Civil Code, requesting a divorce decree and stating various reasons for not being able to live together. She claimed that Wu Julij indeed committed the sixteen points of abuse against elders, attempted murder, and tampering with case files listed in the complaint, and locking her in a room to prevent her from appearing in court, etc. The judge then questioned the defendant, Wu Julij, based on this. According to his statement, he is twenty-six years old, from Changzhou, and his relationship with the plaintiff, Cai Xiaobai, was entirely based on love. However, his personality is irritable, and he admits to knowing this, but marital disputes are very common matters. However, out of consideration for her reputation, he dared not hit her. She now wants a divorce, and he cannot agree. Moreover, last night she was still with him at the Dayi Apartment. He said her considerations were all incorrect. After the judge reviewed the statements, he ordered the closing arguments to begin, which were then concluded. The verdict is scheduled to be announced on the afternoon of the 30th. The plaintiff remained smiling as she left the courtroom, accompanied by her relatives and friends.</p>
<p>From beginning to end, there was no mention of anyone related to Liang Chengyu. Moreover, when the perpetrators of the kidnapping of Chen Shifan, Wu Shenxian, etc., were identified in court, they all claimed not to know Liang Chengyu. This is the only conclusive evidence for Liang's appeal and should lead to a declaration of the appellant Liang Chengyu's innocence. (2) Regarding the original trial's use of Li Liansheng's testimony as the basis for the judgment, the testimony of Li Liansheng was entirely false and inconsistent throughout. This further proves Liang's innocence. In the original trial, evidence favorable to the defendant was not adopted, and the original judgment was based on legally unfounded testimony, suggesting bias and a factual error. It is requested that the original judgment be overturned according to law and a new judgment be issued, declaring the appellant Liang Chengyu innocent, etc. The Second Branch of the High Court has concluded its hearing. Yesterday afternoon, Presiding Judge Yu Hua, along with Judges Zhao and Zhou, appeared in court to announce the judgment. The main text stated that the part of the original judgment concerning the conviction and sentence is overturned, and Liang Chengyu is innocent.</p>

<p>Adjourned for Seven Days to Investigate the Case and Question Further</p>
<p>Mao Fuqing, a forty-year-old from Chongming residing at No. 11, Dexun Lane, Lan Weiai Road, French Concession, recently secretly manufactured lead counterfeit twenty-cent coins at home, selling them in the market to profit. This was discovered by Xu Guilin, a detective from the French Concession Police. On the afternoon of the 24th, he quietly went to the address and arrested Mao. On the spot, he confiscated eighty counterfeit twenty-cent coins, a set of plaster molds for manufacturing, and equipment such as lead bars, a furnace, and a copper ladle, taking them to the station. Yesterday, he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special Second District Court, where Judge Wang Gangxu conducted the interrogation. The police lawyer, Fei Xizhen, presented the case, stating that the police still needed to conduct a detailed investigation and arrest the remaining accomplices, requesting a seven-day adjournment to investigate the case and prosecute. Following this, the investigating detective reported the process of cracking the case against the defendant and presented the seized evidence. The judge reviewed the evidence and questioned Mao Fuqing. He then granted the request to postpone the hearing to November 3. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<p>Huang Baoqiong's Divorce Case Concluded with One-Sided Arguments</p>
<h3 id="e161">Defendant Ye Hongnian Fails to Appear, Judgment Scheduled for the 27th <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Ye Hongnian, from Nanhai, Guangdong, studied at Shanghai Hujiang University. In 1921, he married Huang Baoqiong, also from Guangdong, and they had a son named Genyin, who is now thirteen years old. The year after their marriage, Ye left the country under the pretext of studying abroad and went to the United States. Since Ye left the country, Huang has been disliked by her mother-in-law. Although she was provided with room and board, she received no living expenses. Huang had to rely on her maternal family to maintain her daily life. In 1932, Huang, because she had not received any news from her husband, decided to go to the United States to find him. After searching, she found him, but he suddenly refused to acknowledge her as his wife. Huang then filed a lawsuit in an American court, requesting a separation. Unexpectedly, Ye filed a counterclaim, requesting a divorce. The lawsuit was prolonged and unresolved. As Huang's passport expired, she returned to Shanghai without waiting for the lawsuit to conclude. Now, hearing that Ye has returned to Shanghai and resides at No. 16, Airen Lane, Aiwenyi Road, she hired lawyer Wu Zhenming to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Court, requesting a divorce and payment of living expenses for the past ten years, as well as her future alimony and Genyin's education expenses, totaling over sixty thousand yuan. The First Special Court has summoned Ye once, but because he did not appear, the summons was ordered to be served by public notice. Huang Baoqiong is currently thirty-one years old, residing at No. 47, Hengshun Lane, Shigaota Road, and graduated from Shanghai Nanyang Women's Business School. She comes from a prominent Lingnan family and is two years younger than Ye Hongnian. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Peng Shi continued the hearing in the Fourteenth Civil Court. Ye Hongnian still did not appear. Huang Baoqiong stated that her marriage was entirely based on the old system, so after the marriage, Ye was dissatisfied with her. After Ye left the country, within a few months, he wrote to her expressing his intention to divorce. Her mother-in-law also did not treat her kindly and neglected the lives of her and her son. Genyin's education was also neglected. When she went to the United States to find him, he denied her as his wife and even filed for divorce in an American court. His abandonment of affection is evident. Now that Ye has returned to Shanghai, she has filed a lawsuit, requesting a divorce and payment of alimony and education expenses totaling over sixty thousand yuan. She also stated that Ye has considerable assets in Guangdong, no less than two hundred thousand yuan. The judge then inquired about the reasons for the discord with her mother-in-law. Huang replied that since the judge asked, she could only say that her mother-in-law had vulgar behavior, and the family was dark, so she was quite wary of her. She then presented witnesses Chen Zichao and Shen Xushi, who testified that they had indeed met Ye Hongnian on the road at the end of last year and this year. The judge then legally ordered a one-sided argument and scheduled the verdict to be announced on the afternoon of the 27th of this month.</p>

They were all taken to the police station and detained for further investigation.</p>

<p>A ten-year-old Russian boy named Bopaofu Sheringski (transliteration), residing at number 41, company housing, number 18, Hualong Road, French Concession, was playing alone on the fourth-floor staircase of his residence around 3 PM on the 24th. He accidentally lost his footing and fell through the central opening of the staircase to the cement floor below, causing a head injury. He immediately lost consciousness. His mother, Fositeli Gaofa (transliteration, twenty-seven years old), upon learning of this, immediately sent him to Guangci Hospital by car. However, due to the severity of his injuries, he died before receiving treatment. The French Concession police were immediately notified, and they sent detectives to investigate. They transferred the body to the autopsy room attached to the Shanghai Municipal Council Hospital on Delastour Road. Yesterday morning, a prosecutor from the Special Second District Court was commissioned, along with a coroner and clerk, to examine the body. They confirmed that the deceased had died from a head injury caused by the fall. After questioning the deceased's mother, the official ordered the body to be handed over to the family for burial.</p>

Recently, to further understand the factory's current situation, the dealers of Yixin, Dingxin, United, Science, Wenxin, Zhonghua, and Yuxin stationery stores once again jointly visited the factory to conduct a detailed inspection.

It is said that one section of the book mentioned that the Shanghai city walls were built in 1554, and the purpose of building the city was to prevent the looting and plundering of Japanese pirates at that time. China University Bookstore believes that this is a historical fact and there is no need to make corrections, so it has decided not to care about the Japanese's soft purchase. It is now reported that the first issue has been sold out, and the second issue will be published soon.

<p>Zhiqian felt even more that Yuanhua was hard to talk to. In front of so many workers, it was really inconvenient to prolong Yuanhua's stay? If he turned around and avoided him, he was afraid that he would follow, which would be even more difficult to explain. So, he walked forward and said, "What do you want from us?" As he spoke, he walked out of the back door of Little Western Paradise. This was a very long yellow earth lane. The houses on both sides were all yellow earth walls. The yellow earth on the ground was like ash in a furnace, very lightly laid. Looking from this end of the alley to the other end, there were only yellow colors, and no one was seen walking. Among them, a family with a low door had a few pieces of zucchini leaves showing on the wall. That little bit of greenness further highlighted the indifference of this alley. He couldn't help but exclaimed, "It's very desolate." Auntie Hu didn't quite understand this sentence. However, she certainly understood the word "desolate". She thought he was talking about the food problem. Looking at Zhiqian's face, he looked very sighing, which she could see a little. She then said, "Master, we don't have anything good to eat, just Guokui fried noodles." Zhiqian smiled, and couldn't find anything else to say for a while. He then looked at the door opposite him. There was a small courtyard inside the door, piled with broken pieces of wood and rotten paper. There were also a few chickens, with droppings scattered all over the ground. Under a row of low houses, there were two yellow earth stoves. The yellow earth wall was blackened for most of the side. The house had a wooden door, which was still tied with many latches. The house was dark, and nothing could be seen. Auntie Hu said, "Master, this is our home." Cheng Zhiqian said, "Does only your family live here?" Auntie Hu smiled and said, "My family can't afford to live here. There are three or four families inside." Zhiqian said, "Three or four families live in this little place." (49)</p>
<h3 id="e190">Remembering Cai Yemin <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>The other day, I happened to see a newspaper carrying the news of Mr. Cai Yemin's death. The passing of talented writers and the death of celebrities are very regrettable and lamentable. Mr. Cai was from Wujiang. Friends from Wujiang once told me two anecdotes about Mr. Cai. Now I will record them to commemorate him.</p>
<p>Mr. Cai's family had a maid who was intelligent and good at understanding people's intentions. She added incense while he read at night, and her red sleeves were diligent and attentive, enough to comfort the amorous scholar. Mr. Cai really liked her. However, the maid soon sold her smiles and became a prostitute, and quickly became known as Xiao Lingbo. She was very famous. It is said that the long waistcoat that was popular among women at the time was her invention.</p>
<p>The portrait of Mrs. Xu Dai Zhao Da Yuan's wife, Wu Shanshan, was engraved on a monument and erected on the Pingbo Terrace of Yingdu Lake. Later, this monument was somehow moved to a tofu shop in Lili. When Mr. Cai saw it, he spent money to redeem it. Chen Qubing, the deceased revolutionary poet, knew about this and praised it very much. He wrote a redemption inscription, which was widely circulated in literary circles.</p>
<p>Mr. Cai was listed as a member of the Nanshe Society and was very knowledgeable in poetry. He wrote a preface for Gao Dunjian's 30-year Poetry Collection for Bianya Tower, in which he expressed his opinion: "Poetry is the expression of the heart and also a purposeful expression. One person has one person's poetry, one time has one time's poetry, and one place has one place's poetry. Only with the expression of true emotions can there be proof of true facts." This shows a glimpse of his poetics. His poems that have been circulated outside include Zhan Yuan: "The state of the world cannot be discussed. It is sad to revisit the beautiful place and mourn at Baimen. The gardens of one generation have returned to the dreams of deer, and the customs of a hundred years have been paid to the soul of the cuckoo. Where is the vicissitude of the old home? The past is boundless with smoky trees. After all, the imperial spirit of Nanjing is exhausted. How many cold temperatures have there been in prosperity and decline?" From reading the poetry collection of Liu Guzha, Biaoyu Zhai, and the poetry record of Taolu Shigu Zhai, I got a jueju: "The Hedong Poetry Clan was prosperous in those years, and the old general opened the mountain with strict discipline. The rising Taolu occupies a period of time, and the hard words fall from the pen." The title of the autumn flower thief's picture: "Where is the strong wing of the cloud? Thousands of miles of wind and smoke reflect the sunset. I am tired of hiding my wings on the branches. Let me stay with the yellow flowers for the rest of my life." Perhaps there are poems, but unfortunately I have not seen them.</p>

<p>— (Baling)</p>
<p>I have seen many friends write letters. If the letter is sent to a certain place in the British Concession, they always write the words "British Concession". If it is sent to the French Concession, they always write the words "French Concession". Friends, are you willing to give away the territory unconditionally? If you are not willing, then I implore you, please do not omit the word "Concession" in your letters in the future for the sake of simplicity.</p>
<h3 id="e192">The Vat <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Shijiu</p>
<p>The vat is a necessity for households in the mainland. Without it, water cannot be stored, and water is so important and precious. Especially "rainwater," which can be stored for unexpected needs. Therefore, the vat has become a household treasure. Not only that, but the wealth of a family can also be estimated from the vat. In large households: three-bay halls, four-entrance houses: in the courtyard of each hall, which family does not have a vat? And which family only has one vat? The vats must be lined up on both sides, like servants welcoming guests. Some vats even have tin hats. Some vats also contain goldfish, swimming leisurely and contentedly.</p>
<p>Since the vat is so important, when families in the mainland arrange marriages, some places first ask the matchmaker how many vats the other family has. This custom exists in Dongguang County, Jiangsu. When arranging a marriage, according to the custom of matching families, the matchmaker naturally asks about the family background first, then about the appearance of the son or daughter, and then mentions the family's property, etc. However, this is not the case for families in Dongguang County. The other family's property does not need to be asked, and even does not need to be asked: because as long as you ask how many water vats the other family has, you can determine the other family's economic situation. If there are many vats, then the family must be wealthy; otherwise, the family must be ordinary. The so-called "matching families" is entirely determined by the vat. Even experienced matchmakers often do not wait for the other party to ask about the vat first, but first ask the family entrusted with the marriage how many vats they have.</p>
<p>Look at the vat, it is just a container for storing water, and it is so bulky; unexpectedly, it can be used as a standard for estimating people's property, and it also has such a large relationship with the union of husband and wife.</p>
<p>Two Bad Habits of Citizens—Late to Bed and Late to Rise—</p>

<p>— Original by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Because, according to what I said, when Qianlong returned to Fengtian, he saw that most of the buildings here were very old and the styles were not good. He was a very shrewd and capable person, and he did whatever he wanted. So, he took out a sum of money and had people build many new buildings in Fengtian. This building was naturally also managed by him.</p>
<p>We passed under this city gate. Most ordinary Chinese gates have two parallel doors on the left and right, but they are actually divided into two from one. However, the city gates here are actually two doors, because they are both very large, enough to cover the doorway alone. However, at first, perhaps for special security reasons, two city gates were set up in layers. After passing through these two doors, it was the Forbidden City of Fengtian. A very wide imperial road led directly into the deep palace. When our team stepped onto the imperial road, it added a new color, because the imperial road was covered with golden yellow sand, which set off the red and green figures moving on it. It can be said to be colorful.</p>
<p>There are also some active scenes on both sides of this imperial road that must be described. Because the large team of imperial guards who came with the Empress Dowager had not yet had time to be transferred in, Huaitabu specially selected hundreds of Manchu soldiers from his camp to serve as the Empress Dowager's guard. At this time, they knelt on both sides of the imperial road from a distance. They were about three or four miles away from us. In this gap, there was another group of people. This group of people was also officials from Fengtian, but some of them were not qualified to go to the station to meet the Empress Dowager because their official rank was too low. (159)</p>

<p>— Meixue</p>
<p>Listening to a Doctor's lecture in college is, of course, commonplace and not surprising at all. Since I became a freshman, there have been visiting Doctors lecturing at our school every week. Last week, we invited Doctor X. Before he came to school, someone in the third grade said, "Tomorrow, the Pickled Vegetable Doctor will be lecturing again. My mouth has been bland these days. It wouldn't hurt to eat some pickled vegetables."</p>
<p>Most freshmen are ignoramuses, thinking: "The Pickled Vegetable Doctor must have made some major invention in pickled vegetables, so he got this valuable degree." Some also doubted, thinking, "What major invention could there be in pickled vegetables? I guess this Doctor comes from a poor family and has eaten pickled vegetables for many years, so he has this nickname." They discussed endlessly, so they asked the senior classmates, "What is the exact meaning of the words 'Pickled Vegetable'?" The classmates said, "Tomorrow is almost here. Listen to a few sentences, and you can understand that he is a Pickled Vegetable Doctor."</p>
<p>On this day, Doctor X came to the school to give a lecture. He spoke Mandarin, and after saying a few sentences, he gave us several pickled vegetables. He said... "Last year, my brother came to your school to give a lecture. Now, I am here again, but now there is the current environment, now there are the current feelings, now what my brother is talking about..." He said six "nows" in one breath. When he said "now," it was as if he were saying "pickled vegetable." After a few opening remarks, he had given us six pickled vegetables. When I heard this, I almost laughed out loud, but I finally didn't laugh. This was because I used a ruse and pinched my thigh hard with my fingers.</p>

<h3 id="e195">A Record of Scenic Wonders of Jiujiang <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Wan Gong</p>
<p>Jiujiang is another name for Wuhu, located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River; therefore, it is also known as Zhongjiang (Middle River). In the past, it was a famous scenic area, then it became a commercial port. Merchants gathered, turning it into a market, which caused the mountains to be covered in dust. Elegant scholars no longer chose to visit and climb! However, the jade-like mountains and charming rivers still possess inherent natural beauty that cannot be concealed! Moreover, today, railway transportation serves as a protective screen for the capital, and municipal construction is progressing rapidly. Exploring the wonders and uncovering hidden beauty, how can one resist? I will now provide a brief overview, serving as a guide for visitors.</p>
<p>Tao Pond | Is the heart of Wuhu's scenery. Zhu Mountain and Fanluo Mountain stand majestically, encircling the streets. A long embankment traverses the area, allowing access for carriages and horses to the city. Numerous winding harbors and gardens dot the pond. Notable ones include: the Li family's Liuchun Garden and Changchun Garden, Liucun Village, Yanyu Mound (Misty Rain Mound), Yitao Pavilion, the Shi family's Youyiyuan Garden (Another Garden), and the Gao family's Shucai Garden (Vegetable Garden). Amidst the misty waves, each occupies a corner of strategic importance. The scenery varies with the weather and the four seasons, especially in spring and summer. In the depths, temporary water pavilions and thatched huts are often erected, connected by long bridges to welcome visitors. Just like a beauty wearing simple clothes and unadorned hair, her natural beauty is all the more evident.</p>
<p>Yanyu Mound | Located south of Tao Pond, it is a peninsula in the pond. Originally owned by the Li family of Hefei, it was developed as a place for leisure during his official duties by Ma Yun, the governor of Anhui. Several exquisite houses were built, where famous figures often gathered to compose poetry. Although more than half has collapsed, the flowers and trees are lush, and the shade of the willows is dense. Leaning on the pavilion and looking into the distance, the beauty of Tao Pond is fully captured.</p>
<p>Zhe Mountain | To the right is the Yangtze River, and to the left is Tao Pond. It is the most prominent of the mountains on the lake! It has now been developed into a public park, accessible by both land and water. Ascending from the southern foot of the mountain, one climbs the steps to a pavilion perched atop. Looking east, the Nanjing-Wuhu Highway winds like a swimming snake. Gazing afar, the outline of Dangtu City is vaguely visible. In the park is the tomb of Mr. Liu Xiping. Mr. Liu, a native of Liu'an, was a pioneer in Anhui's education sector. He was upright and indifferent to fame and wealth. He died at Wuhu Middle School, and his students buried him here.</p>
<p>Fanluo Mountain | Located near Tao Pond, the forests and scenery are equally beautiful as Zhe Mountain. Unfortunately, it is occupied by Westerners, who have built churches and schools on it. Although the red buildings add color to the lake and mountains, it is like a divine mountain on the sea, visible but inaccessible!</p>
<p>Yiji Mountain | Located more than ten miles downstream from Wuhu, it faces the Yangtze River. The steep cliffs are a thousand feet high, and passing ships must pass below. From Wuhu, there is a highway that carriages and horses can use to reach it. It is also occupied by Western missionaries, who have established hospitals and schools. Only with their permission can one enjoy the scenery.</p>
<p>Xiaoji | Is a peninsula on the riverside, located at Erba (Second Dam) across the river from Wuhu. A ferry from Wuhu can reach it in half an hour. There is a Sun Furen (Lady Sun) Temple on it, commonly known as Xiaoji Temple. It enshrines the idol of Sun Furen, the wife of the First Ruler of Shu Han. Common people call the First Ruler a "fierce hero" (枭雄), and I realized that the word "Xiaoji" (蟂磯) is a mistake, and should be 枭姬 (Fierce Lady). According to legend, this is where Sun Furen paid homage to the river. The idol is adorned with jade pendants and pearl rings, truly embodying the image of a female hero. The two serving maids also wear long skirts and carry swords. No wonder a "fierce hero" like the First Ruler would be startled upon seeing this! Beside the deity is a couplet that reads: "Tears of longing for her family fall on the cold Wu River; the soul of Emperor Wang returns to the difficult Shu Road" - alas, I forgot the author's name in a hurry. To the left of the temple is the Huai Army's Zhaozhong Shrine (Shrine for Honoring Loyalty), the ink inscriptions are magnificent, worthy of remembrance.</p>
<p>Pangxieji (Crab Islet) | Located near Lugang, thirty miles upstream from Wuhu. When the river water rises, the large lines resemble fists. From a distance, it looks like a giant crab walking sideways. The shape is magnificent! However, the entire island is made of stone, making it difficult to climb. A small boat can easily approach to within half a mile, but then one must stop rowing and cannot go further. Boatmen who are familiar with the stone paths carry tourists on their backs, wading through the water to climb up. The grotesque rocks on the island are indescribable, towering and steep, as if treading on the edge of a sword. The exquisite and translucent parts seem to be the work of supernatural beings, beyond the ability of the Five Ding Warriors to carve. In the northwest corner, a huge rock can hold a thousand people, standing like a cut cliff. The square shape is as precise as if measured with a carpenter's square. Below, the chaotic rocks and river currents collide, the sound resembling the simultaneous ringing of bells and drums, a truly spectacular sight!</p>
<p>The scenic beauty of Jiujiang is not limited to this. Moreover, I am not skilled in writing, and cannot describe its exquisite and magnificent charm in its entirety. However, I can at least show a glimpse of the leopard's spots! Those who have the leisure and interest, why not come and explore!</p>

<h3 id="e196">### Typicality and Reality <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Ren</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>When we read a work that can be called a work of art, we often find in it the shadows of ourselves or the people around us. Thus, we give the characters in the work emotions such as sympathy and hatred; and everyone has a common feeling: things that they have felt in their daily lives, but have vaguely failed to express, all seem to be revealed in that work.</p>
<p>This is where art becomes art, and it is also the issue of typicality in art that we are going to talk about now. There are two aspects to the reason why artistic works have typicality, and why it is essential.</p>
<p>First, we know that art is different from a camera. No matter how thoroughly and delicately one captures all the events and characters of French society in the first half of the nineteenth century, it cannot compare to Balzac's "Human Comedy." Because the former cannot move us like the latter, and the degree of difference is almost impossible to compare. A photographer or a writer who has not reached the realm of an artist captures a character without leaving a trace, but does not leave us with a deep impression; on the contrary, an artistic painter or writer can make us never forget with just a few strokes or a few words. But the problem lies here. These few strokes or few words of the artist, broadly speaking, are a painting or a work, not something that is casually seen and described; it is a fine wine painstakingly distilled from the raw materials of real life. We can eat as much rice or sorghum (the raw materials for wine) as we want and not get drunk, but if we come across a few cups of real liquor in a hotel, no matter how much you can drink, the end result will be a big or small intoxication. Therefore, art is a comprehensive reflection of reality, a concrete and typical thing.</p>
<p>Secondly, we also know that the most powerful and effective form of propaganda in the world should be art. This is where art differs from slogans, and it is also where art is greater than them. Here, art has a great enlightening and educational power. Art is not a pastime for a few people; it is the most precious spiritual food for the majority of people. Therefore, if art cannot be typicalized, then it is just copying superficial phenomena, just writing about the "foam on the river surface", and cannot express the "torrent at the bottom of the river"; the result is a distortion of reality, or a simplification and mechanization of reality. Such art becomes a poisonous thing, or loses its enlightening and educational power, and at the same time, it also loses its qualifications to become art. (II)</p>
<p>Now, I would like to quote the opinions of several artistic writers we are familiar with on this issue. But I ask the readers to forgive me for saying here first a little bit of feeling that I must say. That is: in the recent past, some people recognized that the previous introductory novels on literary and artistic creation were worthless self-deceiving things (and this is absolutely correct, I think), but those who held this view then put all the artistic confessions of creative experience in the same category, denying them indiscriminately. This is something I cannot agree with. All of human culture is accumulated by generations, bit by bit. Art is not a mysterious thing that is beyond reach, nor is it something that can be created by relying on a little cleverness or "impatience." Therefore, all art apprentices have the necessity to take over the legacy of the past and understand the experience that great artists have exchanged for their hearts. The reason why I quote the following words is based on this meaning.</p>
<p>Let us quote the words of old Balzac. In "The Unknown Masterpiece," he said through the mouth of an old artist: "The subject of art is not to imitate nature, but to express nature. You are not a pitiful imitator, you are a poet! Try to make a plaster cast of your lover's hand and put it in front of you, then you will see the terrible skeleton that is not at all similar; you will go to explore the sculptor and artist who does not rely on accurate imitation, but can convey vivid and lively things. We should grasp the spirit, meaning, and appearance of things and creatures..."</p>
<p>Art is not a rigid imitation, but a lively expression; it is not a collection of trivial things, but a grasp of their spirit, meaning, and appearance. This is typicalization, generalization. Each society has its own special type, and typicalization is complex, concrete, and true, so it is completely unrelated to formulization. Fadeyev has been vigorously advocating typicalization and generalization from the past to the present. Gorky said more concisely: "Artists must have the ability to generalize... Writers who describe a small shopkeeper, official, or worker that they are familiar with, although they can properly make a somewhat successful description of a person, will only lose the social and educational significance. Therefore, it will hardly be able to give us anything in the expansion and deepening of our understanding of human beings and life. However, if the writer can extract the most characteristic class characteristics, habits, tastes, desires, beliefs, grammar, etc. from each, from twenty, fifty, or one hundred small shopkeepers, officials, and workers, and combine them in one small shopkeeper, official, and worker, then the writer who has this technique can create a Type, this is art."</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>The above words may have given a glimpse of the issue of typicalization in art. Here, as I am about to conclude, I feel that there are a few key points to say about the following issues.</p>
<p>Also not long ago, some people thought that since art must be subject to the artist's conscious selection and construction, then it is fundamentally impossible to say that art is a faithful reflection of reality. At first glance, this statement seems to make some sense. But in fact, if the speaker does not intend to distort it, it is his negligence.</p>
<p>If the readers understand what I said earlier, they will of course thoroughly understand this issue now. We have said that the superficial description of phenomena, the trivial collection of things, this kind of technique that seems to be "faithful" to reality will eventually turn to the road of distorting reality. Then, the so-called faithful reflection of reality means that the artist should go deep into the essence of phenomena and illuminate the historical necessity in the accidental. In the process of selection and construction, there are two paths for the artist to take: one is to stand on the correct position, follow the above-mentioned road, and deeply express reality in a comprehensive and typical way, promoting history; the other is to stand on an incorrect position and construct things in the work that violate objective laws. But these two roads are chosen by the artist's own worldview, life practice, and other conditions.</p>
<p>Art can only reflect reality concretely and faithfully with the help of generalization and typicalization.</p>
<h3 id="e197">### Old Ancestor Zhao <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Li Qiao</p>
<p>People who go to work in the mines for the first time always have to visit Old Ancestor Zhao in Tongjiu...</p>
<p>Old Ancestor Zhao, it is said that he was from Yuanjiang, Yunnan. He had been losing money in Gejiu for twenty years. He became very destitute, and he simply could not maintain his life. He had to think about running away.</p>
<p>He treated the workers very well, and the workers also treated him well. They worked very hard for him every day, but unfortunately, he always lost money every year. This was really something he could not do anything about!</p>
<p>So, one day, he took out all his money. While no one was in the kitchen, he secretly divided a sum of money for travel expenses and a pair of straw sandals on each worker's pillow. Then, he quietly left the mine alone.</p>
<p>He walked despondently on the mountain road. Suddenly, he was blocked by a snake in front, unable to pass.</p>
<p>The snake was long and big, and looked so ferocious! He stood there hesitating for a while, and felt that there was no way to think of a solution, so he had to sit down in the shade of a tree by the roadside and rest.</p>
<p>He was already very tired from walking. Unexpectedly, he fell asleep as soon as he sat down.</p>
<p>After being woken up, he opened his eyes and took a look: it turned out to be two of his workers. They had run from the mine to chase him, because the mine was now striking a rich vein. They cared for the boss and specifically ran to chase him back. As they spoke, they took out the nugget that they were carrying with them and showed it to him, but he still refused to believe it. Moreover, he thought that they were chasing him back to harm him. He refused to go no matter what.</p>
<p>So, there was no way. Later, his two workers saw that he was so stubborn, so they cut two tree branches and tied them into a cradle, and forced him to carry him back.</p>
<p>When they went back and took a look, it was really striking a rich vein!</p>
<p>Old Ancestor Zhao then made a great fortune! At the end of that year, he hired many horses and took all the money he had earned back home.</p>
<p>He had a very snobbish wife. In the past, when he returned home losing money, she looked down on him at all. This year, Old Ancestor Zhao returned home still wearing his old clothes, returning to his home in a very shabby state. (The things carried by the horses were left behind.) His wife saw that he was still coming home as if he was in debt, so she curled her lips unhappily and went to the neighbor's house. Only his daughter brought out a basin of water for him to wash his face.</p>
<p>Just then, the horses he had hired arrived. He felt very sad, he gave a small portion of the money to his daughter, then sadly rode the horse and turned back to Gejiu.</p>
<p>Needless to say, his wife was rushing to chase him with a regretful heart, but he ignored her and left on his own.</p>
<p>When he arrived in Gejiu, Old Ancestor Zhao used all the money to build a temple behind Baohua Mountain.</p>
<p>The temple wasn't far from Gejiu. The road to the mine had to pass through here. The surrounding area was surrounded by many tall and dense green trees. Cicadas and birds were always hiding in the leaves, singing beautiful songs tirelessly.</p>
<p>A small stream flowing out of a desolate and secluded mountain rock and grass surrounded the front of the temple, gurgling and flowing. The water was so clear that it looked like crystal. The sand miners coming down from the mine would definitely scoop up the water and drink it, because people mostly felt hot and thirsty coming from the mine to this place.</p>
<p>In addition to enshrining a ferocious Guan Grandpa in the temple, Old Ancestor Zhao, who was often worshiped downstairs, was also there…</p>
<p>It was just a memorial tablet, but the incense was very prosperous. It is said that people who came here to pray were "always answered"!</p>
<p>Sitting on the stone steps under the shade of a tree outside the temple gate, one could see at a glance: opposite the temple was an extremely lush forest, and below the mountain was a green field. Gejiu was in the distance.</p>
<p>Listening to the pleasant sound of birds, I couldn't help but take a breath gently, and I forgot that I was a "mine worker" who came to visit Old Ancestor Zhao. If I was in the mines, my goodness, how could you have such a leisurely mood to enjoy the scenery!</p>
<p>Note: (1) "Striking the mine" means opening a mine and extracting ore. (2) "Striking a rich vein" means that there are many ore extracted in the mine, which are also good. (3) The ores found after striking a rich vein look like pebbles, called nuggets. (4) A cradle, also called a sedan chair, is used to carry people.</p>

<p>— Xu Xingzhi</p>
<p>Gazing from the train, nature flies past before my eyes, all things flow with the land, and time is the giant wheel of history.</p>
<p>Towering forests stand tall; the earth stretches boundlessly; white clouds in the sky, like giant waves surging.</p>
<p>Cattle and sheep roam the grass, farmers plow the land deeply, the countryside passes away with the setting sun, and the city welcomes the dusk.</p>
<p>Smokestacks spew out black dragons into the sky, factories have become the masters of industry. The train is the medium of transportation, and it kisses the countryside and the city.</p>
<h3 id="e199">### Fifth Lady <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— TK</p>
<h3 id="e200">### Calligraphy Square (3) <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— He Wei</p>
<p>Then came a hateful punch on my head, right on the temple or nose. It was not uncommon for me to have nosebleeds from being beaten at that time.</p>
<p>"You think you're a child prodigy, huh, that's just people praising you, you don't know what's good!"</p>
<p>His fist landed continuously on the table, a grunt with each punch, and another grunt after each punch, his nose snorting like a bull. Ink splattered on the calligraphy square, one patch here, one patch there, so blurry that it was impossible to make out. It seemed that I could only end up losing money. My father was especially furious, hitting me and dragging my ear, roaring:</p>
<p>"Don't write for me, you animal! You're putting on airs at such a young age. I'm afraid that even your parents won't be able to ask you to lift a pen in the future, right?"</p>
<p>He absolutely forbade me from writing randomly, but there were also different situations. It didn't matter much if the things brought by poor neighbors were written on. The most important thing was not to ruin the calligraphy squares for the rich! If that happened, my father once threatened to whip me to death, but fortunately I still had a few younger brothers, and bloodlines couldn't be cut off by losing one.</p>
<p>"Write on the paper with better quality first, the rich people deserve to receive profit and auspiciousness, do you understand? " He always instructed me while stroking his beard: "That's right, you must do your best to write, you must write to the point where the brush flies and the ink dances. In order to make the ink color bright and the characters look good, you should add a little alum when grinding the ink!"</p>
<p>Lest I would be irresponsible, he would always stare at me with his eyes wide open, fixedly watching every stroke, every move when I was writing those calligraphy squares for the wealthy families. As if he was especially considerate of me, he would grind the ink for me at those times, press the paper down, and spread the finished writing on the ground. He was also afraid that the materials I wrote on would not match the status of the rich, so he would hurry to turn over the calligraphy squares for me, specifying which ones to write on. If I wrote well, then his joy would be as unpleasant as his rage.</p>

<p>This institution, jointly established by the Shangzhi Society and the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture to commemorate Mr. Fan Jingsheng, was organized and founded in October of the 17th year of the Republic of China. Mr. Fan Xudong donated Mr. Fan Jingsheng's old residence on Shifuma Street as the site for the Jingsheng Biological Research Institute. A committee was established to oversee all major plans of the institute. It was divided into two departments, zoology and botany, with Dr. Bing Zhi serving as the director and Dr. Hu Xiansu as the head of the botany department and acting director. There were a total of three technicians, two assistants, and one draftsman. The funding can be divided into two categories: foundation and recurrent. The foundation amounted to 150,000 yuan, donated by the Shangzhi Society and managed by the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture for interest generation. The annual recurrent expenses were allocated from the budget of the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture. Subsequently, due to the increasing number of animal and plant specimens and the increase in staff, the existing buildings became insufficient. The China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture decided to construct a three-story steel-concrete building west of the National Peiping Library inside Xisi Arch as the institute's site. It was completed in April of the 20th year of the Republic of China, and the institute moved in for operation. The old site on Shifuma Street was converted into a Popular Science Museum. Mr. Fan Xudong donated funds for repairs, and a memorial room for Mr. Jingsheng was established inside, displaying portraits and commemorative items. The two departments, zoology and botany, prepared specimens, which were displayed in the various rooms in order. Zhang Dongyin, a staff member, was in charge of the museum's affairs. The Popular Science Museum was established on October 1st of that year, and visitors flocked to it. In the spring of the 21st year of the Republic of China, Dr. Hu Xiansu succeeded as the director. In the spring of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, Director Hu Xiansu, together with the Jiangxi Agricultural College and the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture, decided to establish a forest botanical garden at Lushan. The expenses were shared by the two organizations, and a botanical garden committee was established, with technician Qin Renchang as the director of the garden. The founding meeting was held on August 20th. The staff of the institute has increased annually. This year, there are a total of six technicians, six researchers, and fifteen other staff members, totaling twenty-nine people, plus one administrator for the Popular Science Museum and four staff members for the Lushan Botanical Garden. Since its establishment, the institute has spared no effort in researching and collecting animal and plant specimens. Director Hu Xiansu studied the classification of Chinese seed plants and dendrology. Dr. Bing Zhi studied Chinese mollusks and biology. Technician Shou Zhenhuang studied birds, mammals, and fish. Technician Zhang Chunlin studied fish, amphibians, and reptiles. Technician Yu Zhaoqi studied crustaceans and arachnids. Technician Qin Renchang studied fungal plants. The institute also established a wood research laboratory, with researcher Tang Yao specializing in the study of Chinese timber. There are many other researchers, but due to space limitations, they cannot all be listed. The institute has collected specimens in Jilin, Sichuan, and Yunnan on a large scale, obtaining a large number of valuable items. Recently, animal collection has been carried out on Hainan Island, which is not yet completed. Animal and plant collections have been carried out in North China and Hebei. The institute's publications include annual reports, the Icones Plantarum Sinicarum, the Iconographia Filicum Sinicarum, monographs on the Fauna Sinica, and popular science books in Chinese, such as "Common Fish of Hebei" and "Trees Seen in Hebei Province." Each year, the institute exchanges publications with over three hundred foreign institutions. Most of the institute's books are purchased by the National Peiping Library. The library's biological books, especially those on classification, are all housed in the institute, divided into zoology and botany libraries, for the reference of scholars from the institute and elsewhere.</p>

<h3 id="e209">New Discoveries <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>The institute has collected over ten thousand specimens in various places, and there have been many new discoveries. The most important ones are briefly described below: (1) The polar bear belongs to the bear family, also known as the brown bear. Its appearance is like a bear, white and coarse. It is produced in the high mountains of Sichuan and is a rare animal. It lives in bamboo forests, often eating bamboo shoots and tender branches. (2) The wild cattle belong to the order Artiodactyla and the family Bovidae. They inhabit high mountain forests, are fierce, and like to live in groups. The meat is edible, and the skin can be used to make leather. They are produced in the high mountains of Sichuan and always descend the mountains in winter to avoid the severe cold. (3) The swan, also known as the wild goose, is similar to a goose but larger, with pure white feathers and strong wings, capable of high flight. It is commonly said, "There is a swan above and a seagull below," meaning it is large and not easy to obtain. (4) The Tibetan deer, also known as the black deer, belongs to the deer family and is produced in the high mountains of Tibet and Sichuan. The males have two long teeth on the upper jaw that protrude from the mouth, while the females do not. The skin is edible and tastes quite fresh and delicious. (5) Fish body parasites. (6) Over two hundred new species of herbarium specimens.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Shou Zhenhuang Speaks <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>According to animal expert Shou Zhenhuang speaking to a reporter, there are over 10,000 fish specimens, mostly produced in Peiping and Hebei. Those produced in Yunnan, Sichuan, Fujian, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang include more than ten rare fish. The Yunnan-produced "Yun Carp" belongs to the bony fish class, with a large head and a pair of small barbels. Similar specimens are also collected for four reasons: (1) Different production areas, (2) Different seasons of production, (3) Different ages, (4) Different sexes. There are many birds in Central and South America that produce different offspring in different seasons because they are in the tropics, so the colors are beautiful.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Yu Zhaoqi Speaks <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>According to fish expert Yu Zhaoqi speaking to a reporter, most fish body parasites are copepods. Ordinary people cannot easily see them and do not pay attention to them. These parasites all live in the gills of fish, like stomach worms in the human body, which are not easy to treat. Although there are many fish produced in China, according to my research results, most of the fish in Shandong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang have parasites. Currently, over forty new species of parasitic copepods have been discovered. These parasites affect the growth of fish, shorten their lives, and harm female fish in terms of production, but they do not harm juvenile fish. Eating diseased fish does not cause harm because they are cooked, but the diseased fish themselves are harmed.</p>

The number of female athletes in the province was not small, but most of them were fair-skinned and delicate, too pampered, and completely in the manner of young ladies. From the beginning to the end of the competition, except for Bao Hongfa who won second place in the high jump, the first, second, and third places were completely taken by the Shanghai ladies. Only a small student named Xiang Fan, who was small in stature, won third place in the high jump, earning cheers from the audience. The rest mostly placed in third place or lower.</p>

<p>Foreign Exchange Eases, Falling Another 11.4 Yuan</p>
<p>Gold</p>
<p>Yesterday, the intention to sell strengthened, and the market conditions were weak throughout the day. The foreign exchange market fluctuated downwards, and people seemed unable to cheer up. There was an abundant supply in the market, and even with support, it was difficult to maintain. It is best to be cautious about future movements. At the beginning of the morning, the overseas silver market saw British rise, US flat, and the Canadian forward silver market rebounded by 3%. The exchange rate soared, and the price of raw gold in London fell by another 5 pence. The off-market preparatory transactions opened slightly weak, and the mood collapsed, falling further. After the opening, the Central Bank announced its listing, with British flat and US rising by 1.875. Customs gold shrank by 6%, and the value was hovering around 90 yuan. Afterwards, banks took advantage of the low price to settle, and the domestic market slightly improved, leading to more buyers in the gold market, gradually pulling up the price. Although it rose at this time, the multiple positions looked rather illusory. The foreign exchange market opened with British flat and US rising by 2.5. The psychology of the industry was unstable, and there was little change. When the Central Bank's equalization tax fell to 8.75%, which was 1% lower than the previous day, the psychology of small investors wavered, falling by 5 yuan immediately. However, the general psychology was very stimulated by this, and after falling, buying activity rebounded by 5 yuan. After all, the equalization tax rate for the day was based on a British exchange rate of 1 shilling, 4 pence, and 625, which was much cheaper than the market price. People's hearts seemed to waver, and large investors sold off, falling back to within 90 yuan. Although there was support at the lower price, the scattered morale and excessive supply caused the US dollar to ease to above 33 yuan, and there were still many sellers. The price gradually fell before noon, slightly continuing after noon. The afternoon market still insisted on British gold, and the domestic market continued to harden. The selling pressure from large investors intensified, approaching the 80 yuan mark. However, there were quite a few people maintaining at the lower price, and the sellers also stopped selling as prices dropped. After the price fell, it gradually rose. The Bombay report was down 3 annas, and buying activity began to form. Sassoon sought to settle, and short positions were also covered. The gold price was able to rise slightly, but the market was sluggish and difficult to rebound. Therefore, after rising, the market resumed selling, and the final situation hovered. The overall trend was flat. Under the sharp increase of short positions, the trend wanted to rise but lacked strength, and with a certain party shorting, it is necessary to guard against long-term changes in the future.

<h3 id="e239">Securities Debt Market Exhibits Abnormal State Before Settlement <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>More Swap Transactions at the End of the Session... Greater Fluctuations</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange was on the last day of October futures. The environment was still as dull as before. The market was only squeezing codes, but it was still lively. Sometimes it was squeezed by many, sometimes it was squeezed by short, completely inconsistent. The market price also showed an abnormal situation. However, the intensity of the squeeze was far different from the past. Today, only one month of the 11th futures will be done, and it is expected that there will be no big waves. The process yesterday, the opening slightly squeezed by many, the sale of No. 1116 and other more涌, the price was slightly small one or two corners, to the 23rd year of customs, it was lightly squeezed by short, so the rear columns are good one or two corners. In the next session, No. 4 and No. 5 were sold, while No. 31 and No. 53 were bought in, and the price was only slightly one or two corners. In the afternoon, the situation suddenly turned to short selling, and the month-end was high for many. The regular six squeezed high four corners and a half, causing the distant market to invert. This kind of abnormal situation is completely due to the relationship between the empty swap. Most of the closing was still short squeeze, but it was pressed down immediately after the rise. Because it was the last session, the floating long and floating short that had not been settled were all in this session swap, so the fluctuation was more, but the rise and fall were also only three or four corners. The market price result, most of them were high near and low far, the rise and fall were different, ranging from 5% to 6%. The total turnover was about 20 million yuan. When the spot price rose, various stocks of Huang Chuqiu were added, but there were not many subjects. The results of the rise and fall are compared and listed on the left (unit 兀 turnover unit 100 yuan stock unit 1 share)</p>

<p>|| Standard flour for the month of opens on the 26th ||</p>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the market for each month showed a trend of being strong. The quotation for foreign wheat, Chicago was better by about 1-2 corners, and Canada was better by about 4-8 points. When the opening price was quoted, although this month was close to delivery, the North Road customers were still less active, but the manufacturers were accumulating chips and gradually making up for them. Therefore, the market sentiment gradually became firm, which was better than the closing price of the previous day by nearly one point, and the forward price was better by about one point. Until the afternoon opening, the near months were still recovering due to delivery, the market was stable, and the successive months were soft because the standard gold turned weak. Compared to the morning, it fell by one point. Recently, the exchange rate has been fluctuating, and the future of the flour market has been unexpected. Risks also. As a result, this month rose by two points, November was better by seven and a half, December did not move, January fell by five, and February fell by seven and a half. It was also reported that the exchange announced the standard for March and scheduled to open for bidding on the 26th of this month as usual. At the same time, the supplies for the factory have also returned to normal.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market, the market for each month showed a near-term strong and far-term flat trend. The standard wheat quotation was better by 1-2 corners in Chicago and 4-8 points in Canada. The recent standard has been stable in the minds of people inside and outside the industry. The current wheat is smooth, and the wheat merchants from various places are not as sad as before. Therefore, on the market side, there are fewer people leaving, and people's hearts are also gradually becoming firm. However, in the afternoon, it was slightly softer due to the standard confusion. The distant period was weak because it was feared that foreign wheat would be cheaper. As a result, this month rose by five points, November was better by six points, December was better by two points, January was better by one point, and February was smaller by one point.

<p>Yesterday, the market conditions for foreign Ke Xian rice rose and fell. Foreign rice was lively in the Japanese street sales, and the market price was gradually rising. Yesterday, this street fell because the price of Hexia rice fell. The appetite for foreign rice has faded. The unified market only handles 1,000 bags of Saigon rice and 150 bags of foreign Yuan rice. The price of 300 bags of broken rice sent to the mainland is smaller than the previous market, and the foreign companies have been holding on tightly for days. Since the previous day, they have been selling one by one. Yesterday, they sold another 600 tons of Saigon in November. The recovery range also opened 300 tons, and the price was only 5 yuan. In the afternoon, it fell to 4.95 yuan, which was a sudden drop compared to the previous market. The stock of Ke Xian is already thin, and the arrival is also slight for days. However, the stomach of the mainland is very active, and this street is also asking. Although there are few transactions, the rough rice has risen by one corner and the machine rice has risen by five points. A total of 4,200 bags were opened, most of which were handled by the mainland.</p>

<p>(Hu Nan) Yesterday, the sources from various gangs suddenly surged, with a total of 50 numbers and 7,000 stones of goods. There are many kiln seeds among them, so since the kiln seed market was forcibly pulled by the sales side, today the people's hearts are weak and the sales market is dull. At this time, the sellers who are more afraid of holding the goods than the county will start to panic and all drop the price to seek to get rid of it. The market fell sharply and the market color went downstream. However, at the same time, it seems that the destination is more active, and the Qingdao Gang is also out to handle more than 400 bags, so the resulting situation seems to be slightly flat, but the market price has fallen by more than one corner to two corners. The supply and demand of white rice and field rice are similar, and they have no glory. Du Jian is standing tall because the price plate has bottomed out, Yang Jian is still standing, and the broken yuan and Bian Yuan are conservative and normal. The new Yin Yuan's destination is ordinary, and the source is quite prosperous, so the sellers are willing to dump the price. The decline is as high as three or four corners. Yesterday, six kinds of market angles have been listed, and the goods are of excellent quality, but it is the first batch, and the market color is firm.</p>
<p>(Hu Bei) Yesterday, more than 30 ships arrived from Hexia and various inland routes. The sales of new high-quality japonica rice are active on the market, while the medium and secondary grades are slightly sluggish. Broken rice, new Du Jian, kiln seed, new Chenbu Kejian are handled with care. Chen Baiyuan has been converted skillfully. Liquor merchants slightly enter new sheep tip, which is rare and quite popular. The market is broken. The high-quality japonica rice is stable. The medium-quality machine-milled new japonica rice is very tight and one corner higher. The medium-quality is flat and tired. The kiln seed new Du Jian Yin Yuan price is tight by a few points, and the new Bu tip is one or two corners higher. Chen Baiyuan is slightly soft, the new sheep tip is two or three corners higher, the Chenbu tip is a few points higher, and the new Chen Kejian is close to the corner higher.</p>

<p>Since Dalian new yellow soybeans have been on the market, it has only been three weeks. The total source is more than 200 vehicles. Because the current Geng's identity is insufficient, the source is not crowded, and the destination is also small. Since the first batch of first-hand opened at 4.3 yuan, it has fallen by 7 corners recently, so the industry insiders who specialize in internal car workshops and Yuanfang workshops are happy to depreciate and promote sales, and do more dark markets. It was heard that 6-700 packages were opened in the market yesterday, and the price was 3.51 yuan, so the other new beans in the market were all brought down.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the market was slightly smaller due to customs duty and the recovery momentum was weak. The association divided the 24 rough sand white spot goods, and the call for 18.9 yuan was not successful. Transit goods were 5.7 yuan, down another corner.

The lifting of Qing was 13 yuan, the high yellow Qing was 12.5 yuan, the secondary from 12.3 yuan to 2.5 corners, 2 corners, and 1 corner.

It is heard that the sales of fixed-sale jackets and overcoats are more prosperous than Western-style suits and pullovers. The herringbone tweed with a lower grade of 2.78 yuan per yard is now generally raised to 3 yuan net. The yellow especially rolled shortage is especially expensive. The shop tailor's retail cut requires 3.4 yuan per yard. The Kong Shi brand riding breeches tweed has a unique sales trend. The retail cut is 8.56 yuan per yard. The other brands 1005 is 8 yuan. The Japanese goods priced at 4 yuan are also in short supply and active.</p>

<h3 id="e256">Overseas Chinese Expelled <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— Qian</p>
<p>Every day the newspaper publishes news of overseas Chinese being expelled and returning to their country, and photos of many poorly dressed overseas Chinese, and I cannot help but feel indescribable sorrow and disappointment after seeing them.</p>
<p>China has long since become a country with "import surplus," and the amount of money flowing out each year due to the import surplus is difficult to calculate. If calculated according to the outflow of dozens of years, China's finances would have been out of control long ago. Fortunately, there are a large number of overseas Chinese selling intangible goods (services) and bringing back some money; and the success of the revolutionary cause is mostly due to the supply of those poorly dressed overseas Chinese who have been expelled and have nothing to eat after returning home.</p>
<p>Thus, the service of overseas Chinese abroad is the only dumping goods left over from my country's industry and commerce, and the only source of financial supply. Now, because the number of overseas Chinese in China and abroad has increased sharply, they are able to endure hardship and make money, and they are envied by various countries, so they have repeatedly been forcibly confiscated of all their property and expelled; on the one hand, it is hindering the sales of goods, and on the other hand, it is increasing the number of unemployed people in the country. Like now, when China is full of recession, where are there so many places to settle them; and the indirect impact is to cut off some of the sources of wealth brought back, and to promote China's financial crisis.</p>
<p>Therefore, to ensure that my country's financial resources are continuous, in the modern era when industry and commerce and all enterprises are waiting to be cultivated, the only way is to do everything possible to protect the overseas Chinese's activity abroad, so that they can gain some advantages abroad, and then many important national constructions will increase the power of investment, which is such an important and awaiting event!</p>

<p>— Xu Xizhen</p>
<p>(The sky in late autumn is dyed with severe influenza, and the earth is sprinkled with a gray, plain, and unshaded light. Cars and people are walking on the street, and the hammers in the workshop are ringing regularly: however, this world is dead, plain, lonely, and cruel.</p>
<p>In late autumn, when the wind blows the corners of people's clothes, I think of the red leaves in my garden and the grass chrysanthemums in the corners of the fields.)</p>
<p>Rising up is a smoke-like homesickness.</p>
<p>People who are suppressed by life are like clowns training tigers in a circus. If they let go, they will be swallowed up. In order to live, this world should be completely dynamic: swinging swings, trains on rails, and the shadows of airplanes on the ground.</p>
<p>But on a rest day in late autumn, the mood of "people" is revived || When working, people are machines, without feelings, without sadness, without thinking; but when the mood of "people" is revived, the lines of thought in the heart grow like weeds in April, looking at the cloudless October sky outside the window: gray and white, empty; the heart is like a large piece of cloth that has been bleached, blank, and can be creased.</p>
<p>(Loneliness is like leaves falling on the ground.)</p>
<p>Light a fire, light a strong-smelling cigarette, inhale it, and then exhale it, dissolving the strange and melancholy thoughts into one smoke ring after another, watching them rise and fly away, but in the end, they disappear weakly in mid-air.</p>
<p>I was also surprised that people who are dragged and run by life in the metropolis also have the leisure to observe the posture of the smoke rings? But what can be done? The human heart is an organic combination, different from gears and iron nails. It needs rest and nourishment, just like the human body. Given the opportunity "even for a second", it will not let go and shoot towards thinking for thousands or tens of thousands of miles.</p>
<p>Let memory be the crutch in the hands of a traveler, trying to find something lost on some trampled land in the past; but the result is just as expected, it is a kind of vagueness like the future. This revelation may be of some use to me. It shows that: there is nothing in the past.</p>
<p>And the future, experience tells people, the future is the most unreliable. If there is really a road to the future, then at least as it looks now, isn't it as vast and immeasurable as a cave in a deep mountain? Really, in primitive times, who dared to say that a lonely traveler on a desolate continent could determine whether the plain in front was a desert or a pasture?</p>
<p>In this way, the heart is like flour with water: it is stagnant. There seem to be many hard needles piercing around, and there seem to be soft silks winding around. Struggling and resisting, the result is falling into a viscous blank mud pit, which is strangely uncomfortable.</p>
<p>I remember someone saying: Boredom is a regular customer in leisure. When the door of leisure is opened, it will come to visit.</p>
<p>Suddenly I remembered: This indescribable disturbance in my heart has a specific term: it is boredom!</p>

<p>— Jingyun</p>
<p>"Grandpa, my stomach hurts so much I can’t walk anymore."  Da Mao clutched his stomach with both hands, squatting on the dirty ground.  Sweat beads, the size of yellow beans, streamed from his forehead down his thin cheeks like a waterfall.  His dark pupils kept rolling upwards, and his brows were tightly furrowed.</p>
<p>"Da Mao, just endure it a little longer.  While the sun hasn’t risen too high yet in the morning, let’s try to cover a few more miles, or…" Zhang San’s father knew that his grandson had been traveling for days and nights on arid roads, and at the same time, he hadn’t had enough food. His physical and mental strength were exhausted, and his feet felt like they were rooted to the ground, making it truly impossible to move.  He thought about the life they used to have at home, compared to the current wandering and drifting, and he felt a pang of bitterness.  Tears involuntarily flowed from the corners of his eyes.</p>
<p>Zhang San's father was a simple and honest old man.  Usually, when he worked, he wasn't exaggerating or careless, and he had no vices.  Except for the occasional pipe or two of dry tobacco during his leisure time; but now, even tobacco was out of the question.  Therefore, every year, through hard work, he managed to save a little, and the family's life was quite comfortable. This was something that people in the village envied and considered as a model.  However, Zhang San’s father's only son, A Gen, unfortunately died suddenly in the field during the summer three years ago.  This made Zhang San’s father believe it was a great misfortune for his family, and at the same time, he resented that he hadn’t accumulated enough good deeds in his life, attributing his son’s death to fate.</p>
<p>Originally, someone like Zhang San’s father, who worked hard, was frugal, and focused on saving, could have勉强勉强 gotten by during this famine year. But, in the first half of the year, his old wife and daughter-in-law both fell seriously ill and died one after the other. At the same time, the price of silk plummeted, causing Zhang San’s father to lose a lot of capital. Zhang San's father had hoped that he might be able to recover some of these lost funds during the autumn harvest. However, since the beginning of summer, the heavens had refused to send rain. The fields were cracked like tortoise shells, and the rice seedlings were all dried up like straw. Under these dire circumstances, the "village tiger" Shen Youcheng, the local constable, led a rain-praying gathering. Under the pretext of setting up altars to pray for rain, and "robbing the Dragon King," he forced Zhang San’s father to hand over money. Zhang San’s father was unwilling to submit to this unreasonable extortion. But how could he possibly stand against the "tiger" Shen, the local constable! At the same time, people who sympathized</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>with Zhang San’s father were afraid of causing trouble, holding onto the principle of "sweeping only the snow in front of their own doors," and didn't dare to offer assistance. Thus, one evening, under the threat of Shen, the local constable, Zhang San’s father handed over the money he had saved.</p>
<p>Now, the countryside had reached the end of its resources. Everything in the house had been eaten or sold, even tree bark and grass roots had been consumed. For the sake of his only concern, his young grandson Da Mao, he finally made the decision to leave his home, which he was unwilling to leave, taking his grandson with him to wander and flee the famine with the people from the same village.</p>
<p>Many famine refugees helped Zhang San’s father, grabbing and twisting Da Mao’s back and tendons. Zhang San’s father’s tears fell like broken strings of pearls, one by one, onto Da Mao’s pale and terrified face.</p>
<p>"Da Mao is probably not going to make it!" Some of the older people watching shook their heads and sighed.</p>

<p>— Sanduo</p>
<p>I don’t know how to dance, and I’ve never been to a dance hall. No, I've been passively dragged there once. It's said that a "character-splitting booth" was set up that day, but I don't know what it meant. I hope someone who is proficient in dance hall jargon can tell me.</p>
<p>While all industries are experiencing year-round deep discounts and giveaways, it seems that the dance hall business hasn't been affected. The experience of the one night at the "character-splitting booth" made me feel that capitalists who don't invest in dance halls are fools!</p>
<p>However, the majority of patrons in dance halls are university students. Japan has ordered to prohibit university students from dancing. If this has a knock-on effect, then there will be a need for a lot of "buy one get one free" advertisements. So, this investment doesn’t seem very reliable.</p>
<p>A university student I know well said that the Japanese government is too bored, that university students dancing has nothing to do with the government, and that dancing is a legitimate form of entertainment.  Does the government expect university students to be buried in the library?</p>
<p>This makes sense, and it's even more impressive. Studying is for the purpose of saving the country, and dancing can also save the country. Since studying and dancing are different paths leading to the same goal, why prohibit it?</p>
<h3 id="e261">Winter Thoughts <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— Jia Chen</p>
<p>Winter has come, and people who live in the gardens of happiness have changed into the most expensive and latest style of winter clothes. In the glass displays of the big department stores, in response to the seasonal demands, there are piled up many expensive clothes and accessories, waiting for some noble people to consume them. It also brings all kinds of different scenery for these people to enjoy. They have warm houses with hot water radiators, soft and brocaded quilts. Winter is full of warm, dense, and beautiful dreams. When they're bored, they can use a car to send their bodies to the more intoxicating, brightly lit dance halls, hugging fleshy women to pass the long winter nights. Confined within a colorful venue filled with the scent of fragrant powders, with a gold-tipped Chesterfield cigar in their mouth, standing at the window of a tall, foreign-style building, looking down at the street below, at the yellow rickshaw pullers with legs flailing against the biting cold wind, they will sigh through a layer of glass: "How miserable!" But at this moment, their hearts are as soft as wax. Because the metal musical instruments in the back are playing a hypnotic night dream tune again. If it's a late night with swirling snowflakes, swaying on the elastic cushions, and they see homeless children and vagrants in torn shirts standing in the streets outside the car, they will smile with a similar sigh: "How cold it is!" But these people, as if they aren't afraid of the cold, are still wearing those clothes that don't cover their bodies, wandering the streets. What are they doing? Yes, their eyes only see the green lights on the tall, foreign-style buildings, and their ears only hear the decadent jazz music. They see and hear nothing else.</p>
<p>They can't even imagine how some other people spend the freezing days of winter. In some people's hearts and lives, winter is woven into an endless misery, a veil of boundless darkness.</p>
<p>The gift that winter brings to these people is terror, trampling, sickness, and death. Therefore, these people are more afraid of winter than any other season. Thus, they curse winter, they hate winter, they see winter as an enemy. But even though they curse it, winter doesn't stop coming or turn into spring because of it. In fact, spring in winter has long existed, it just grows in another world that has no connection with them. Those other people are singing the praises of winter and admiring winter. Winter also accepts their good intentions, comes to the world with a smiling face, comes to their world. Nature, after all, is duplicitous. It looks down on those who walk with hunched backs and yellow faces. It respects the desires of those who live in the spring of winter.</p>
<p>All the scenery in winter is precious. The emerald-like, shimmering snowflakes fly all over the sky outside the window, plating the earth into a crystal-like silver world. And inside the window with the hot water radiator, in the fragrant house, drinking red grape wine, listening to the crisp singing, and watching the white snow falling outside, you think, how delightful this situation is. Although white hair, in another sense, can become a white knife, under the white snow knife, gasping and groaning. But the white snow does not diminish because of this, it acts as the only embellishment, a beautiful embellishment, for some people as the spring of winter.</p>
<h3 id="e262">Curses, Chapter Three <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— Xiaolin</p>
<p>Thinking about my own dissolute life, I feel that I am also deserving of curses. I curse myself for knowingly doing things that I shouldn't do, still going to places I shouldn't go, saying that I must change this depraved behavior, but saying doesn't matter, in fact, I still can't change it, and I'm only allowing myself to become more depraved. Isn't this deserving of a curse?</p>
<p>I have long regarded dance halls as demon caves, where many women in gorgeous clothes are blood-sucking ghosts, soulless zombies draped in colorful clothes. But I can think this way, but I can't act this way. From time to time, I still sink into those places that I consider demon caves, willingly letting my blood and energy be swallowed mouthful by mouthful by those ghosts, without cherishing it at all, and without the slightest fear. Because once I slip in, I am no longer myself, but become another person. Then I am completely bewitched, following people into a dream-like, fragrant warmth, forgetting that women can suck blood, forgetting that roses have thorns, and even forgetting myself, forgetting everything. As soon as those rosy lips, smeared with rouge powder, tell a series of sweet lies, I immediately suffer from '烟士披里纯症' [a disease related to being obsessed with romance], even if I understand that the words are lies, I still believe them. So, my past beliefs, my past strong thoughts, are all shattered into pieces by those golden high heels, and my whole body and mind are trampled and panting under those golden high heels. At this time, even if I were to be treated like a mule to be ridden, it would be unavoidable, because my life is no longer my own, but experiencing joy and sorrow because of their joys and sorrows.</p>
<p>At the first light of dawn, I step out of the green glass door, and the cold wind on the street awakens the fogginess in my brain, seeming to clear it up suddenly. I touch my empty pockets. The gold has all slipped into the women's hands during last night's madness. And what have I gained at this moment? Besides an unbearable fatigue and a heart full of desolation. For a moment, I don't know whether to cry or laugh. But at this moment of sobriety, life has once again been filled with stains.</p>
<p>Who can I curse besides myself? That place is fundamentally a combination of hypocrisy and deception. Women are selling smiles and selling joy, so you can't expect them to wear a sad, crying face. It's for life! Who doesn't know that all the joys are temporary, and that time is piled on top of money? And my own money comes from my own hard work, and I lightly send the</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>crystallization of this hard work into the women's smiling faces, into their hands. But no one is forcing me to do this, it's all my own worthlessness. I can think but I can't act. Who can I blame? I should just curse myself. There are naturally many people in the world who deserve to be cursed. But I am the one who most deserves to be cursed.</p>
<h3 id="e263">Rebirth <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Jiong</p>
<p>Time passes quietly, like flowing water! Having left all the old land and old friends, alone in this desert-like environment, spinning and circling. Silent, my soul seems to be floating, without anything to attach to. On this unfamiliar road, I sit alone in a small room every day, not even knowing what I am doing. Borrowing a window on the sun-drying platform to breathe, suppressing all desires, sighing, is this the price we deserve for living? In such an environment, I often feel like this.</p>
<p>In the early morning, the red sun hangs high in the sky, the southern sea, under the bright sun, shines beautifully.</p>
<p>Alone, I stood on the fourth-floor sun-drying platform of the school, gazing longingly into the sky, gazing at my hometown, which is over there? Ah, that golden childhood paradise! How many past years of laughter, past ambitions, past illusions, past school life, past lively friends, it is truly unbearable to look back on. When I think back, waves of old hatreds and new sorrows come over me, like the morning mist covering the distant mountains, wrapping around my heart!</p>
<p>Constant thoughts are locked tightly in my heart.</p>
<p>Living in a foreign land is just like sailing a small boat in the vast sea. Living and dying are with the passage of time, but there has never been stability! Whipped by the cruel whip of life, just like an old horse pulling a freight cart. In the current global economic turmoil, with wars and man-made disasters everywhere, and cries of hunger and cold filling the entire planet, to change my current painful life, unless the entire world is transformed into a new life, a perfect paradise, then my request for "rebirth" will not be as fleeting as a dream!</p>
<p>The bright sun shines into the house, reflecting light everywhere; the gentle breeze blows in, bringing the scent of autumn chrysanthemums. How much are people suffocating in the darkness looking forward to "rebirth"!</p>

<h3 id="e264">Another Contribution to "Go to the Northwest" <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>A few days ago, your publication published an article by Zhou Shaotang entitled "My Views on Going to the Northwest," proposing to organize a "Northwest Development Research Association." I fully agree. The slogan "Develop the Northwest" has long been loudly proclaimed, but very few people have actually gone to do it, so there is no achievement to speak of. There are many reasons for this continued failure, but the biggest reason is that we young people lack a strong organization. The second question raised by Zhou Weizhi in "Prerequisites for Going to the Northwest": "What happens when you get there?" is something we must pay attention to, because the Northwest is a barren place. If we go there alone, we will be filled with desolation and have nowhere to turn. How can we find a job? But if we have a collective organization, a concrete plan, and implement a collective approach to developing the resources of the Northwest, then we can solve this problem. However, we must consider the current communications and politics in the Northwest, as these are closely related to the development of the Northwest. Therefore, while we promote "Go to the Northwest," we must also support the government, promote the Longhai Railway project, develop transportation in the Northwest, and improve politics in the Northwest.</p>
<p>Furthermore, transportation in the Northwest is extremely inconvenient, and news is very isolated. If we want to go to the Northwest, we absolutely cannot act on a whim and rush there rashly. We must have thorough research and practical investigation beforehand. Therefore, I believe that organizing a Northwest Expedition Team is just as important as the Northwest Development Research Association (it can also be said to be part of the work of the "Northwest Development Research Association"). With thorough research and practical investigation, then the collective development of the Northwest will be more likely to succeed.</p>
<p>Now I want to organize this "Northwest Development Research Association," solicit comrades to join, and set up a meeting place so that it can exist for a long time, so that our comrades can continue to go to the Northwest. Among the young people and students who are shouting about going to the Northwest, students account for the majority. It would be best to establish a Northwest Expedition Team during the winter or summer vacation. After the investigation, some comrades would be responsible for the vanguard, while others would stay behind to deeply study the knowledge needed to develop the Northwest, so that they can communicate with each other, research together, and work together. If we work together, even if the Northwest has all kinds of difficulties, we should be able to solve them. My mailing address is Fudan University, Jiangwan. I hope that young people with aspirations for the Northwest will write to discuss all matters related to organization and implementation, and I hope to organize this group as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Parting and reunion are both sad over a wine glass. A farewell banquet is set up at the long pavilion for Qiu Kui. Because my wife forced me to disobey the order, I have to go to the capital for one time. Looking at the blue clouds in the sky, triggering feelings of separation. Yellow flowers fill the ground, expressing the same sorrow. Enter the Jinma Yutang [a metaphor for being a high-ranking official] as soon as possible. Sooner or later, it is difficult to violate fate. Steadily climb the osmanthus tree in the Moon Palace. Swear to not return if your name is not on the Golden List. Take care on the windy and frosty wilderness inns. And on the often traveled path be careful in life. The right way to face the fact that good things are often destroyed, do not lie in bed with bad luck. If there is news from the horizon, a certain Mud Jin [a type of fine paper] will certainly hold your happy news. The horse slowly walks, the carriage quickly follows. The remnant sunset shadow is urged by a whip. Thousands of words of concern, mixed with the dust blowing to [Zheng] Lu’s face. What bitterness there is in life from separation, send you off a thousand miles apart. May the memories of shared minds follow your dreams.</p>

<p>The sound of the pounding block under the moon, intermittent. Tears wet the fragrant silk as a dream is rudely awakened. The hair on the temples is easily disheveled. Leaning on the railing, I see the moonlight. The autumn light opens my eyes to sights that are all sorrowful. The vast landscape is filled with the autumn wind. I fear seeing the swaying shadow of the fading flowers. I hate hearing the heartbreaking sound of the bells. It’s hard to find an entertaining scene in dreams. Time turns into the new autumn clouds over the river. In the deep chamber, sometimes I lift the curtain and sit. Alone in the embroidery room, I secretly groan. I remember often laughing and talking before the small banquet, in front of flowers. It’s hard to describe the ten thousand kinds of emotions. I remember going to enjoy the lotuses with a paddling sound. Hiding the spring in the lotus picking boat. I remember meeting in the red chamber and talking about innermost feelings. Swearing to the same hundred years of heart. I remember walking together in the snowy mountains. Seeing the plum blossoms on the ridge heralding early spring. I remember playing a storytelling song for you. The sound is like jade and the words like pearls, that you can certainly hear. I remember sitting side-by-side on the grassy ground. I remember going to see the bright moon on the pond under the moon. Now there is separation and the soul often lingers in dreams. At Nanpu, the feelings are deeply melancholy. The west wind enters the courtyard as a familiar face. Wanting to ask someone in Guangling to send it to the east. How many stages have you already passed on the road?</p>
