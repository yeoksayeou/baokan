<p>軍縮失敗歐局嚴重</p>
<h3>英遠東政策轉變　工黨領袖抨擊政府對日姑息　保守黨猶不忘情於舊日同盟　西門外相解釋九國約　謂尊重與保證顯有别</h3>
<p>（倫敦）今日下院開會時、工黨領袖克利浦發言抨擊日本在遠東所施之政策、</p>
<p>工黨領袖發言抨擊日本堅稱日本已開始實行帝國主義的開拓，日本之趨嚮不在俄國、卽在中國、克氏繼謂俄國實力雄厚、故日本軍閥家深入西比利亞直達貝加爾湖之野心似己稍戢、而轉其鋒於華北、日本欲在華北成立第二『滿洲國』、已爲衆所公認、英國其仍將默認其在華利益範圍爲日本所分割乎、要知日本旣吞併華北、卽將凖備蠶食華南、而逐出歐洲之列强、傳説日本已以甘詞誘引土耳其加入德日聯盟、果爾、則反對國聯之集團或將產生、而以日德力量爲其後盾云、當克利浦演説之際、中國公使郭泰祺及其他要人均坐旁聽席中、</p>
<p>保守黨員對日頻送秋波保守黨議員凱伊斯繼起聲稱、新加坡軍港不能視爲日本之患、但與紐絲綸及澳洲之防務至有關係、英日聯盟之終止、渠恒以爲惜、吾人如與日本商獲透澈的良好諒解、則殊有益於帝國及遠東英人之利益云、</p>
<p>九國公約英有撕毁意圖外相西門於今日午後一時三十七分在下院演説、謂日本半公式聲明雖引起許多他國之焦慮、但與交涉者、乃英政府也、日外相廣田旣向英大使林德萊發莊嚴之保證、渠安能對友邦政府曰、『余不之信』、任何國未有担任用其武力以保持中國土地完整與政治獨立者、九國公約僅言尊重領土完整而已、尊重與保持、顯有别也、至於國聯辦理遠東問題、是否失當、論者不一其詞、固各有見解也云、</p>
<p>改革國聯先求解决軍縮西門繼乃討論國聯改革問題、謂渠與意相墨索里尼皆願重行考慮國聯盟約、彼等以爲如將此事摻入業起周折之軍縮討論、則恐未能促成妥恊、盟約任何修正、應容德國參加、英國擬竭其全力以助成軍縮問題之解决、</p>
<p>經濟制裁不願輕易實施英國現正密切研究經濟制裁問題、惟此種制裁，苟輕率實施、未有不引起戰爭者、制裁不應僅對於弱國行之、亦必適用於强國、經濟壓迫、苟無實力、則無效可言、吾人深感美國對國際事務的改善所予之供獻、但須知美國將來行動、自有其範圍、吾人若推想越出此範圍、則殊無益也、</p>
<p>西門次言及日内瓦之局勢、對於一般人所抱『吾人已達可悲冒險事業之終點、而當偃旗息鼓』之見解、加以評駁、謂吾人如果一事無成、則貽禍於世界實不堪設想、西門繼復言及大不列顚始終爲衆領導、志在告成軍縮、如目前對軍縮之企圖不幸失敗、則卽須以新的努力繼之云、西門演説歷一小時之久、未乃答覆克利浦之問話、謂大不列顚對國聯遠東事件之報告書、當然予以擁護、非預有適當之知照、决不背離之、西門最後一語曰、『吾人一日爲九國公約所拘束、則吾人必竭所有之能力以遵守之』</p>
<p>、（十八日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）今日下院對於日本問題爭辯甚烈、西門外相力爲政府對日政策辯護、並答復議員之怒質稱、彼今復欲促議員諸公注意、英國雖曾表示尊重中國土地之完整、然英國並未作維持該項完整之任何保證也云、當辯論之時、自由黨及工黨議員均斥責政府鼓勵日本在遠東擴張疆土之行動、英政府之答覆日本對華政策宣言、亦遭嚴厲抨擊、工黨領袖克禮蒲斯開始今日之辯論稱、日本對於遠東之和平以及全世界之和平、巳作嚴重之威脅云、克薩禮特氏則稱、以英國自身在世界他處之行動而論、吾人勢難對日首先擲石、擬議中之制裁、不僅促成英日戰爭、且將引起日美戰爭、故吾人不應對於日本臨之以威也、海軍大將祁斯氏主張對日妥恊稱、日本在東方情事佔有大份、勢所必然、將决意邁進、故余主張英政府應對日本善爲諒解、繼又討論空軍軍縮公約恊定、樞密院長鮑爾溫發出驚人之言論稱、此項公約必須規定對任何破壞之國加以制裁、此種制裁、無有不引起戰爭者、故吾等如欲制裁、必須備戰云、目下英國己在進行擴充空軍之初步計劃、鮑爾溫承認世界局勢之嚴重、惟仍自信英國在最近之將來、不致有何危險、鮑爾溫又稱、如欲實行集合保障式制裁、則勢須置英國於更强之地步云、今日下午西門外相又在下院聲稱、軍縮會議之失敗、已屬不免、然此非爲世界之末日也、軍縮决裂之日、吾等應卽另闢蹊徑、以進行致力於此、有以軍縮已如安靈祭者、似屬太</p>
<p>愚、因英國仍將於將來會議中謀救於萬一也、（西門所謂將來會議、係指五月二十九日國聯之軍縮總會而言）、惟下次會議時、英國不將再行提出主張、祇再闡明英國前次之建議、而徵詢其他國家代表有無較佳之意見云、（十八日國民電）</p>
<h3>日對華新政策有吉返任將有發展</h3>
<p>（東京）美人所辦之日本廣知報今日社論、謂日本外務省之所以於四月十七日發表不許他人染指中國之言論者、固知列强現正考慮若干具體方法以復興中國爲目的也、日本如拒絶第三國以國聯名義扶助中國、則必自己能以其所不許中國受諸他國之扶助給諸中國而後可、日政府今似凖備爲之、不久日本或將以駐華公使有吉明發表日本行動之計畫云、（十八日路透電）</p>
<h3>僞滿鴉片問題英西門答議員之問</h3>
<p>（倫敦）英外相西門今日在下院答工黨議員格倫斐爾之問話、謂國聯鴉片委員會並未發表關於日本軍事佔領下中國東北數省設立鴉片公賣之報告、英政府遵守鴉片顧問委員會之建議、嚴密檢查輸運麻醉品入滿洲與熱河之呈請、並遵守海牙和平公約下之義務云、（十八日路透電）</p>
<h3>日人神經過敏中俄密約無稽</h3>
<p>莫斯科日聯社所傳現在北平之中國駐蘇大使顏惠慶與蘇聯駐平外交代表已訂</p>
<p>立關於内蒙之密約、據塔斯社就各可靠方面徵詢之結果、此項報告顯係徹頭徹尾之無聊云、（十七日塔斯電）</p>
<h3>李維諾夫抵日内瓦俄入國聯問題將有新發展</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）蘇俄外交委員長李維洛夫將於今晚抵此、即將與法外長巴爾都氏會談一切、據云、其所商者爲蘇俄加入國聯問題、故此間預料不久即有重要之發展云、（十八日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）蘇俄外長李維諾夫今日已抵此間、雖爲軍縮問題而來、但復引起一般人對蘇俄加入國聯可能性之注意、李氏定於今日午後會晤法外長巴爾都、然後將訪國聯意總代表阿樂錫與英代表艾登、今雖尙有重大困難、須事消除、然衆信各種問題可在九月間國聯大會開會時獲滿意解决、波蘭與西班牙現均主張如以行政院永久理事席給予蘇俄、則當亦以此席予兩國、波蘭又要求條約上之少數民族權利應使普及、聞蘇俄願衆邀其加入國聯以免自已申請而遭人反對、有失體面、（十八日路透電）</p>
<p>國聯技術合作會</p>
<h3>通過拉西曼報告　確認合作辦法助華建設　分送技術機關加以研究　顧使駁斥日無理反對　頌揚拉西曼克盡職責</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）十七日下午、行政院中國與國聯技術合作委員會通過拉西曼報告書、該委員會將俟國聯各技術組織對該報告加以研究之後、再行召集會議、（十七日中央社電）</p>
<p>（南京）外息、中國技術合作委員會十七日開會、吾國代表顧維鈞發表演説、要點在對拉西曼之報告、認爲忠實、且遵照國聯所付與之職權範圍内服務、此項演説、對日方無理反對己加以駁斥、（十八日專電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯行政院技術合作委員會開會、通過下列决議案、行政院技術合作委員會十七日開會研究拉西曼報告書、及該技術代表申述其自任命以來至本年四月一日止在華工作之各詳細文件、拉西曼對中國與國聯技術合作之發展、曾作一簡短之陳述、於交換意見時、中國代表向委員會傳達中國政府對技術代表及其他專家在華之服務、表示特殊感激、更將中國政府因經由國聯得與各國技術合作視爲饒有價値一節、特爲指出、行政院技術合作委員會知悉國聯與中國合作之實施、係依照一九三一年五月三十一日一九三二年四月三日及行政院技術合作委員會一九三三年七月十八日之各决議、且欣悉各該决議所規定之合作方法、於中國建設工作有所裨益、應請秘書長將技術代表之報告、分轉於國聯之各技術機關、并請技術代表對於有關係之各技機關及有關係之各股補充給予一切必須之消息、秘書長并應將技術機關之意見、於適當之時轉送與行政院技術合作委員會、又此次報告并應由秘書長分送於行政院各會員國、（十八日中央社電）</p>
<h3>顧代表致辭</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）今日國聯中國技術合作委員會開會時、駐法華使顧維鈞博士提出諍議、謂拉西曼博士之報告書、完全爲客觀的、書中紀述中國正確之現狀、中國旣感國聯所予之襄助、而對於拉西曼博士恪遵國聯行政院之决議案、並以純粹技術與非政治的狀態盡其職責、亦殊欣慰、中國願對尊重其完整與政治獨立之各國開放門戶、而予以均等機會、技術合作問題、乃中國以獨立國所應享不可分讓之權利、中國確信其迅速之建設事業、乃其本國與受經濟厄運的世界所必要、故决計以種種有效果的方法、賡續其努力、其最可收效者、厥爲與國聯之技術合作云云、本日開會、除顧維鈞外、其餘</p>
<p>各員無討論拉西曼之報告書者、該報告書現已送交國聯技術組織、一面將繕一會務報告、分致行政院諸理事、但不予以討論、（十七日路透電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>今年之災害</h3>
<p>— 廷</p>
<p>年來我國天災人禍。紛至沓來。客歲水旱風雹蟲霜諸災尤稱嚴重其間最慘酷者。爲河南山東陜西（下半年）河北江蘇等省之水災陜西（上半年）甘肅福建貴州靑海等省之旱災。或則洪流傾灌。泛濫千里。或則驕陽鬱蒸。禾苗焦枯。人民死亡枕藉。災情奇慘。説者謂爲亘古鮮有。洵非虚語。今年入春以來。冀省石頭莊蹙凌陡漲。挾流在趨遂致淹沒七十餘村婦孺涉水凍死於寒流中者。指不勝屈。河南滑縣一帶。去年受災最重。凌汎期内。每日均有屍體順流而下。卽據最近半月前調查。該縣五區之水底凹。尙有五十餘里。一片汪洋。依然澤國。甘肅水災。亦稱奇重。被災區域。已達四十餘縣。哀鴻遍野。嗷嗷待哺。四川南川縣。素號貧瘠。去歲收成歉薄。入春後。蓋藏日竭。食料缺乏。赤貧人家。多掘取白沙泥。勉强果腹。如是而苟延殘喘者。日有七八千人。最近江蘇江北一帶。春荒現象。隨處可見。而連日江水奇漲。堤岸堪虞。秋汎期間。轉瞬卽届。尤爲沿江各省莫大之威脅。黃河各口。雖經堵合。而據專家查測。黃河仍有改道之虞。如不趕築大堤。今年水災。必較去年尤爲激烈。濁流所至。或可南淹蘇皖。北淹冀魯。『南决。則勢必挾淮水以入江不僅導淮計劃及揚子江工程。全功盡棄。卽豫皖蘇三省人民。亦悉遭昏墊。北决。則勢必横斷平漢津浦。跨衛穿運以入海。不僅連年之海河工程撞壞無餘卽豫冀魯三省人民亦被害無窮。』中央政府雖有黃河水利委員會黃河水災救濟委員會等之設。近以經費困難。災賑機關且加結束。遑論修築長堤。</p>
<p>我國旣往水災之釀成。實由於堤防失守。河道梗淤。是則人事之不臧。實尸其咎。　得盡諉天災。中委覃振氏嘗云。『水患决非天災由於治水未努力』</p>
<p>可謂知言。興辦水利事業爲拯救水旱兩災之不二法門。夫人而知其然。惜我國之水利機關。系統龐雜。事權不一去年調查。全國水利機關多至五十七處。而粤桂滇黔各省。尙不與焉。内政部曾有統一各機關直屬於行政院之議。迭經討論。終歸擱置。至於歷年治水經費。本嫌微薄。不肖之徒。且從中舞弊。侵蝕自肥各地方軍閥。任意移挪。充爲内戰之軍費者。又比比然也。水利事業之流　如此。又安怪天災之頻仍哉。</p>
<p>其尤可慨者。各地農村經濟瀕於破產。水旱固不聊生。豐收亦竟成災。卽如江浙皖贛湘卾等省。入春以來。米價之低落。實爲五六年來所罕見。而都市之糧食市塲。反爲洋米所侵佔。農產品中。除米穀以外。如小麥。花生。烟葉。絲繭棉花等亦一致慘落。農民需要品價格之降低。旣不能如農產品之甚。而種種苛捐雜税之壓迫。又無所逃避。是以雖遇豐收。仍有入不敷出貧無立錐之嘆。不寗惟是。今日農村崩潰之現象。已遍於全國。而一般土豪劣紳。且在乘災盤剝。魚肉弱小。競以低廉代價。兼併土地。民二十年大水災之後。此風日熾。馴至富者益富。貧者益貧。社會安寗之基礎。勢非趨於摧毁不止我國過去歷史中不乏因災荒威脅而使農民暴動之故事。贍望前途。誠堪憂慮。執政當局愼勿漠視之也。</p>
<p>薊縣日軍即可撤退</p>
<h3>曲世和與日員坂庭前往調查　薊民團重武器一律不准留用</h3>
<p>（北平）薊縣事件經殷汝耕與柴山交涉結果、决定派員前往調查後、日方專員坂庭與我方派定之曲世和二人昨午同車前往、當時到薊、經調查、悉當地民團中、每於大軍過境時、不免有重武器遺棄、遂代爲收留、現日方旣提出要求、所有重武器一律不准留用、曲與坂庭卽將返平覆命、在薊日軍撤退期尙未定、（十八日專電）</p>

<p>（四）椰子油税—羅斯福總統反對將百分之三之椰子油税併入近爲國會通過之賦税修正案中、然總統將被迫簽署此案、因總統不欲因此一點而將全部否决、</p>
<p>（五）社會問題—此項咨文將詳細處理自不景氣產生之各種社會問題、例如貧民窟之淸理、住宅、聯邦政府防止犯罪行爲、救濟貧窮、養老金、工人之酬勞金、及失業保險之類、衆院多數黨領袖波恩斯稱、</p>

<h3>美海軍模擬戰結果　證明艦隊具防衛運河力量敵欲佔領或毁滅代價必巨</h3>
<p>吉巴康登那馬灣據高級軍官宣稱、海軍當局在此次戰術演習中所得之敎訓甚爲可貴、此項操演自四月九日美國艦隊自聖彼特羅出發、直至康登那馬灣時始告結束、美聯社訪員今日得悉此次操演之三項顯著結果如下、</p>
<p>（一）巴拿馬運河在理論上可爲敵國艦隊佔領或毁滅、但其代價卽最强之國亦不能負担、故實際佔領殊不可能、（二）在現狀下、日美海戰完全不可能敵軍以大隊海軍攻擊、雖能在大陸登岸、然以較小艦隊估領運河之任何企圖、實等於自殺、（三）爲上項事實關係、戰艦遂成爲防衛巴拿馬運河之主力云、</p>
<p>此次操演以美國艦隊在戰事爆發措手不及之情勢、進行防衛巴拿馬運河及美國之東部爲目的、並假定敵軍能佔據西印度之前進根據地、及在加里濱海集中强有力之艦隊演習時竭力模擬實際戰爭狀况、海軍部長史漢生今日由無綫電向美國艦隊總司令賽羅氏祝賀成功、海軍作戰代理長官都席枚亦加讚美稱、若以多數艦隻之艦齡而論、此次演習結果、實屬難能可貴因多數戰艦已届滿其艦齡也云云、（十七日國民電）</p>

<p>因德國對於設立特别制度以保護少數民族一層、表示反對也、（三）决定舉行投票之日期、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）據今日堅强報所載之消息、國聯籌備薩爾區域公民投票事宜之二人委員會之主席阿樂西、已請求德法雙方委員互相讓步、據云、阿樂西氏之意見、係德國應給與莊嚴擔保、凡薩爾區域人民、應有绝對之投票個人自由、並對於投票反對回復德國國家主權之人民、不得加以報復之手段、再則對於薩爾少數民族、亦應加以擔保、倘以上諸點德國能加以承認、則法國及國聯應卽放棄其組織國際警察之提議云、（十七日國民電）</p>
<h3>薩爾管委會覆德文件發表　行政處置不當受德攻訐　謂與管理精神背道而驰</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）今日國聯秘書處復發表薩爾管理委員致國聯函一件、該函係該委員會對於德國宣傳部長戈培爾氏上次在芝凡勃魯根所發表演説之答復、因戈氏之演説、對於該委員會之行政處置、頗多攻訐之辭也、查德國對於該委員會攻擊最力之一點、厥惟德國亡命及政治犯之逃入薩爾區域者、多在薩爾區内報界服務、從事反德運動及馬克斯主義之宣傳、而管理委員會中亦竟有加以延聘者、此實與國聯管理該區之精神背道而馳、且諸政治犯中、復有一部份係犯有普通刑事罪者、而薩爾區政府竟貿然加以容納、亦與該委員會之任務不合、此節前於二月二十七日已由德外長牛賴特向該管理委員會提出正式抗議、現該委員會之答復、爲該委員會對於入境之一切人等凡有刑事嫌疑者、俱巳一一加以調查、但委員會中之職員、其由德國施行文官新法令之後被迫離職者、自不能一律作爲亡命者看待云、德國方面大槪將認此種答復、爲拒絶考慮德國抗議之表示云、（十八日國民電）</p>
<h3>阻止大厦谷戰事美與國聯合作　總統將請國會立法禁運軍火</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）今日據國務院次官斐利浦表示、羅斯福總統或將請　國會卽行通過軍火禁令、蓋以日内瓦方面曾討論世界各國禁止軍火輸往玻璃維亞及巴拉圭兩國也斐利浦宣稱、美國凖備與國聯合作、以阻止大厦谷之戰事、惟須國會授予此項權力後、羅斯福總統始能發表禁令、參衆兩院已通過一共同議案、授權總統禁止軍火出口、該議案曾經參院修正、故尙待衆院同意、總統之行動以國聯行政院之主張爲出發點、蓋以國聯代表曾表示禁止軍火至巴玻之計畫能否實行、將以美國願否加入禁運恊定爲轉移云、美國會方面之共同議案、因參院之修正而受延宕、參院之修正文規定、軍火出口禁令應對交戰國之雙方同時施行云、故此項修正文、對於美國或國際方面對侵略國</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>關於哲學上幾個基本問題的檢討（四）</h3>
<p>今日再論盛吉甫君提出之『四』『五』二問題，因與以上三日有密切的關係，</p>
<p>編者希望讀者能將全文檢閲一遍。</p>
<p>編者</p>
<p>四『主體與客體的統一，是否在社會的實』</p>
<p>踐過程當中』？</p>
<p>明白了以上的解釋，對此問題，當可得到</p>
<p>正面的答復。因爲社會是充滿矛盾的變化、發展，－運動（這卽社會的實踐）從社會的實踐過程當中，顯現出人類的認識來。</p>
<p>、　譬如軍閥貪官汚吏，設立了無數的關卡，抽收種種色色的苛捐雜税，使得商品貨物的流轉遲滯，貨物價格提高；對外不能和精美價廉的洋貨競爭，對内縮小了大衆的購買力。因而生產蒙受極大打擊，（工農首當其衝）國民經濟爲之不振，故要生產建設也好，復興農村也無不可，總要先廢除苛捐雜税，纔能談得到本題。不是這樣辦，那末建設，復興，都不過爲了關卡的設立者，充實腰包的笨事，與生產經濟毫無意義。</p>
<p>對於苛捐雜税，生產停頓，經濟凋零······</p>
<p>等等現實的認識是客體：認識這些現實的變化運動及其必然性以至廢除苛捐雜税，復興經濟，那是主體了。</p>
<p>而主體與客體的和合，一致，合調！統一的字眼較爲難懂，故用這些字眼代替－確然是由苛捐雜税以致貨物流轉遲滯、市塲狹小，生產不能擴大，反而縮小停頓等實踐過程當中顯現出來的。如果我們進一步去考察，卽苛捐雜税廢除之後、（狹義的説法）貨價卽减少了捐税部份而降低，大衆的消費力提高、因而生產行程加速，工農商業皆活躍，經濟卽隨之興盛，這不是很自然的事嗎？</p>
<p>七『人類的本質何以不是他的肉體』？</p>
<p>但讀者尤須懂得的，人類的認識，並不是刻版的不變的東西。（這，在第三項問題中，已經相當説明過的。）因爲客觀世界的變革，人類的認識，跟着也就變化。</p>
<p>民國初年，以至五四運動前後，男女平權，婦女參政運動，是很時髦的，及後就被剪辮放足，自由戀愛，所替代了。到了最近，自由戀愛，也不是鮮艷動心的名詞了，婦女解放運動，也不是當作可以單獨解决的問題而提出了。這都是由於客觀現實的變化而變化的。再看看西歐的民主共和運動罷，在十九世紀是多麽炫人心目的寳貝，多少人爲她而犧牲流血。現在呢，變成爛衣敝屐了。說近點的例罷，『生產合理化』在幾年前，世人都以爲是挽求資本主義沒落的救命菩薩，現在呢，又以爲統制經濟是神仙。這無非是說明客觀環境的變化，影響到人類思想的變化，假如人類的認識是不變的，那末十年前的戴季陶和現在的戴傳賢不是二個絶不相同的人嗎？前者是鼓吹唯物論的革命家，後者却爲誦經唸佛和尙，故祇以五觀肉體來認識人類的本質是不對的。他是充滿社會性和歷史性的。卽人類的認識也在不斷的變化過程中。人體細胞之新陳代謝，不是一個普通常識嗎。</p>
<p>然而猪，狗，牛，馬，總之無論禽獸草木，却祗有其具體的肉體枝幹，雖有種種變化，也不過是肉體形狀的變化罷了。人之異於禽獸的道理，猶在於人類的本質，不僅僅有肉體的具形。所以費爾巴哈以爲人類的本質是他的肉體是錯誤的。</p>
<p>讀者如對以上的答復，仍然覺得不明瞭，則望你把怎樣就是社會主義的社會，多加一翻研究，同時研究矛盾的絶對性和相對性怎樣顯現出來。</p>
<p>尾聲</p>
<p>哲學本來是一門較抽象的科學，尤以認識論部份較難理解，（其實哲學無非是認識論與方法論的合一。）故欲找得人類生活之正確道路，必須要獲得正確的認識論與方法。我們應當他是『人生　鑑』一樣來研究。從實踐中來領悟。老實説，離開實踐，是談不上懂得辯證法的。</p>
<p>我們對於哲學的研究，是極淺陋的。不過讀者已經有所質疑，無已，祇好盡理解所能到的，誠摯地向讀者答復。其中不盡詳明，或不滿意的地方是在所難免的。讀者看見了，仍望能　指正出來，但我們自問，對於解釋問題，是極愼審的，文字固力求簡單明瞭，卽舉例也盡量採用通俗或爲大家所周知的事情。正是這樣的緣因，也許不能十分闡明各個活潑的槪念。總之，讀者從實際運動中，實際的生活中，留心的研究，定能得到正確的認識。（完）</p>
<p>春秋</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>現在讓我們再爲皇太后的『鸞輿』寫一些記事。其實『鸞輿』這兩個字，祇是一個習用的名稱，那東西根本不</p>
<p>是什麽『輿』，祇是一輛籐轎而已。</p>
<p>無論在那一隊的儀仗中，或是在那一次的大典中，這輛籐轎總是佔着一個極重要的位置。因爲它好像是太后的家一樣，就是當太后自己並不坐在這輛籐轎裏的時候，一切大臣們還得恭恭敬敬的向它磕頭。－－這也是歷代帝皇相沿下來的一種習慣，只要是皇帝或皇太后所有的，或是所用過的東西，臣下見了，就得一般的足恭致敬，不得褻凟。</p>
<p>單祗爲了這一乘鸞輿，又特地多備一輛車來裝載它。這一輛鸞輿不但也有一輛專車，而且還有一個特製的木架，給它襯着，使它不致接觸着底下的木板；－－就是車上的地板－－爲的是這些地板，都曾給尋常的人踐踏過，當然不能再沾汚太后的鸞輿。從北平到奉天去的路上，太后還屢次的需用到它而在每一次使用的時候，全列的火車就得停下來，先在太后所坐的那輛車子的門口，擱上了那一塊在伊上車時所用過的木板，然後再在這一塊木板和那鸞輿的中間，架上一條跳板似的東西；這前後兩條木板上當然都有很厚的絨氈墊着，太后在上面走過，便可以像走在粉絮上。一樣的溫軟舒適了。</p>
<p>若問這一乘鸞輿的外觀和裝飾，那可眞是光彩極了！像這樣美麗的一乘轎子，的確配有一輛專車來裝載它！</p>
<p>因爲它是太華貴了，太美麗了，我眞不知道，應該怎樣的形容它才適當！（三七）</p>
<h3>五月裏來</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>白糖梅子上市了，大黃魚上市了，脱掉棉袍換夾衫，大少爺玩『高而夫』，黃包車夫解下腰帶抺汗，天上浮着白雲，空氣有些　塞，推開窗來，嘆一口氣－『這倒霉的五月』五月，我最怕過的季節，這月份是慣會鬧鬼的，這月份會呌好好的人生起病來，素來患着風濕症的，交進五月的節氣就要發作，『先天不足』『後天失調』的，更加受不了，腿節灣裏，胳膊，背脊，······都隱隱地酸痛，半身不遂，眼望着人家神氣活現，暗自想想，好不傷悲！</p>
<p>有痛請郎中，請郎中吃藥，這是『天經地義』，害病的人决沒有『幸占弗藥』的，否則，郎中餓死，藥店關門，勢所必然，可是，我家的太太，偏和郎中做對頭，今天城隍菩薩面前磕七七四十九個響頭，求來香灰一包，逼我用燒酒呑服，明天吕純陽那裏畫來靈符一道，呌我燒灰咽下，我委實沒法，苦苦哀求道：『太太，還是請一個郎中吧，菩薩？』</p>
<p>靠不住吧』？</p>
<p>不料太太來了火氣，大聲説：『郎中就靠得住嗎！你可斷得定那一個是好郎中？有幾個說眞話賣假藥，有幾個依老賣老，傷風也醫不了，有幾個剛得時的死要錢（診金），菩薩靠不住，幹嗎人家化那麽多的錢趕到ＸＸ做道塲』？</p>
<p>我説：『罷了罷了！我只巴望五月快些過去，讓六月的陽光來曬死那批妖魔鬼怪，呼一口新鮮空氣』。</p>
<h3>兩張照片</h3>
<p>— 持佛</p>
<p>難怪古人要相信『月老紅絲繫足』的神話了。據咱朋友所講的一段戀愛佳話，眞是非常有趣；咱不妨寫出來吧。</p>
<p>這是三五年前的事吧。海上ＸＸ銀樓，有一個學從Ｓ君，年方十六，生得十分俊俏，品性旣溫和，服務也很勤儉；平日出入業師家中，猶如自家子弟一般。有一天，師母爲了搬家，唤Ｓ來幫忙。在雜物零亂之中，Ｓ忽然檢得一張美人照片，正在凝神觀看時，師母的女兒，怱怱跑了過來，要奪那照片。嚦嚦說道：『這是儂前年攝的小影呀；你要它則甚』！邊說邊伸手來奪。Ｓ瞧了畫裏眞眞，愛不忍釋，那裏肯放，急急塞入懷中。伊嬌嗔地央求了一回，突然伸手到Ｓ的衣袋裏，原想奪還自己的照片，不料竟取到了他的錢袋，見裏面果然有一張照片，仔細一看，原來不是自己小影，却是Ｓ的照片，嬌滴滴越顯紅白，芳心不覺一怔。嫣然道：『你不還我，　的夢士</p>
<p>我也不還你』；Ｓ『』也笑道；『好，大家保存着吧！一笑而散。</p>
<p>後來過了半年，伊搬到Ｎ埠去了。Ｓ先寫了信去，問問師母的安，又問問伊在甚麽學校讀書，快畢業嗎？不久，便得着伊的回信。起先，不過互相問候，沒有說到什麽。後來文勢越凑越緊，越做越好；兩方面如醉似痴，鎭日地在來鴻去雁中下功夫了。這件事微微風聞在業師的耳中，便把Ｓ解了職。伊一聽到這個消息，號陶大哭，並剪一揮，竟把伊的髮剪了，啼啼哭哭，要到尼菴裏去。師母不得己，乃遣入諷示Ｓ君，托某甲來說媒，有情人終成眷屬云。</p>
<h3>狂風驟雨之夜</h3>
<p>— 黎民</p>
<p>時鐘己打午夜二點了！</p>
<p>濕霧迷茫的三公司屋頂如畫的晝的電光，也早熄滅，熱鬧的日昇樓，好似鬼蜮般陰沈。</p>
<p>狂風驟雨下，馬路上積水泥濘，除了四輪階級的人們，挾了嬌妻戀人，經過東亞，大東，新新等旅社的門口進門，上樓實行他和伊的同夢外，汽車夫也遵命開回，到下處和黃臉婆恩愛，天明再來候駕。</p>
<p>發瘋似的狂風，吹着吹着，好像猛獅怒吼般聲震瓦屋，膩人的驟雨，下着下着；行人如鯽的日昇樓，現在淸凉得好似無人之境了。</p>
<p>臨着夜班的印度阿三，立在街頭抵抗冷風雨的襲來，寒戰震齒，只得縮頭縮腦地蜷伏着，好在這時己無形戒嚴！紅綠燈對天愁嘆，三點，四點······直至天明，伊們都做了十字街頭的徘徊者，捕房裏的義務女探員。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十八回　　巧合共觀塲痴情拾帕　殷勤兩問疾誤會投書</p>
<p>又擁上臉來了便笑道：我埋怨大正月裏，不該害病呢。這話怎麽就讓嫂嫂聽了去了？你進來坐一會兒？甘太太笑道：不必了，以後你不發生騷也就得了。甘太太口裏這樣說着，人閃在窗戶後面，可沒有走開。積之這時，正在那怒氣塡胸的時候，那裏就肯把這件事揭開過去。跟着又歎了一口氣道：寗人負我罷了。這句話算是甘太太聽得最淸楚，他也不再說什麽，點點頭就這樣走了。積之坐在屋子裏，很感到無聊，將桂枝寄來的那封信，重新由頭至尾又看了一遍。自己冷笑着一聲，兩手撳着信封信紙，一會子功夫，撕成了幾十片，落了滿地，這還不算，自己又用脚着力踏了幾下，笑道：再見罷，趙太太！說畢，自己就爬到床上躺下來了。他這樣的舉止，自然有些出乎常軌，積之家裏男女僕人也都看在眼裏。吃中飯的時候，積之躺在床上，不曾起來，到了吃晚飯的時候，才感到有些餓。而且想着，若是再不去吃飯，也恐哥嫂疑心，所以也就坦然到堂屋裏去，與哥嫂同席吃飯。厚之當他進出的時候，眼光就在他臉上注視着，及至他坐下來，還注視着不斷。甘太太坐在他對面，看了這樣子，便笑道：厚之，你爲什麽這樣老注意着你兄弟？厚之道：他是剛剛病好了的人，我看他氣色不大好，疑心他又時病犯了。積之道：我明天就回學校去罷，免得閑出病來。厚之道。身體不太好，你就該多休息一兩天，怎麽倒急於要走呢？甘太太笑道：你讓他走罷，在海甸街上，他不免受到一種刺激的。（三八八）</p>
<p>小食譜</p>
<h3>竹筍</h3>
<p>— 賢賢</p>
<p>竹筍，在暮春季節裏，蘇杭一帶，眞出了十足的風頭。高貴的菜餚裏，果然少不了竹筍。家常便飯，這似乎也非雜幾片竹筍不可。甚至於設在工廠門口，以及馬路旁邊的油豆腐綫粉攤上，也得在雜味湯鍋裏，載沉載浮着三五個竹筍，應一個景兒。鮮竹筍，一名春筍。春筍的生長，究竟是爲了要長成竹竿，預備將來被用以成器，而造福於社會呢，還是爲了要孳生蕃殖，擴充地盤呢，還是爲了要快人類的朶　？這一筆賬，因爲世界上找不到了創造萬物的上帝，所以也不能有個交代。不過筍味是的確鮮美可口的，所以我們不妨就認筍是爲了要供人饕　而生長的罷。</p>
<p>有人說，春筍宛如姑娘。幼小時，躱在泥土裏，像姑娘未成人時，是不很受人注意的。待到春風吹到了大地上，春筍便像初解風情的姑娘，透出地面來撩人了。可是在那時候，内心裏是潔白而充實的，自然還含有天眞的憨態。過了這一個時期，入世漸深，所感到的，只是美人遲暮的空虚而已。過了這一個時期之後，靑春已經消逝，綠葉成蔭，只有凖備着抵抗炎日霜雪的份兒了。</p>
<p>在這暮春天氣，竹筍是恰像二八佳人。－－心，非但是充實，而且是純潔無疵的。</p>
<h3>玫瑰種種</h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>這幾天，玫瑰花上市了，紅得像處女頰的顏色，給人們無上的愉快和陶醉。它的香也是甜蜜蜜地，濃冽得像已經攙和了糖霜。可是它的用途，更偉大啦！我們在家常，也少不掉它，怎麽説呢？請瞧！</p>
<p>玫瑰花泡茶極平常的茶葉裏，放一兩朶玫瑰花，便把茶葉轉變得好了許多。新鮮的果然最妙，就是陳舊的玫瑰花乾，放在不透氣的盒子裏，也不至走味的。放在紅茶裏最合宜，但是放在綠茶裏也不壞。不比代代花只宜綠茶，而不宜紅茶，見得玫瑰花的『和光同塵』。玫瑰花浸酒燒酒是最强烈刺激的飲品了，假使放了些玫瑰花生裏面，隔了些時，玫瑰花嬌艷的顏色都消失了，可是燒酒的味兒，却柔和了不少。並且香而且甜，女人家也可以嘗一些了。分明是玫瑰花可以軟化燒酒，很合『柔能克剛』的原理。</p>
<p>此外手續比較麻煩些的，尙有玫瑰露，玫瑰醬，玫瑰糖，玫瑰半梅等等。那些糖果店裏到了玫瑰花上市的時候，有一種特别的出品，恐怕别地方不容易得到的，是用上好的白糖，和以新鮮的玫瑰花瓣，製成極薄的片子。含在嘴裏，又香又甜，比那些舶來品的口香糖，幽雅文靜得多。就是論顏色、眞合着西廂所說『嬌滴滴越顯紅白。』可惜天氣漸漸的潮濕，這種糖又不合放在石灰　裏的，所以只買十幾天，就沒有了。</p>
<p>玫瑰旣然如此有用，而又可愛，我們何妨自己種植呢。說也奇怪，蘇州花傭，年年把玫瑰花樹挑上街頭來賣，買回去種植的，十九不活。因爲它是要分種的，隔年老本身上不會繁榮，所以稱它『離娘草。』幸虧價錢狠宜，第一天上市，每朶不過十文錢呢。</p>

<h3>菲人　竟不知我國歌</h3>
<p>（中央十八日馬尼刺電）遣運大會行開幕禮時、奏我國國樂、係用我國民黨黨歌、但前昨兩日游泳塲中、我國楊秀瓊每獲第一時、竟奏卿雲歌、足見菲人辦事昏瞶、而我代表亦未加以糾正可怪、</p>
<h3>修改會章問題　日要挾菲律賓　菲方態度如何最可注意</h3>
<p>（日聯社馬尼刺十八日電）關於改正遠運會章問題、倘菲律賓方面、届時出以失信行爲、則日本當不再提出改正會章、預定卽時退出大會、又聞根據會章第十四條其第三條亦須改正云、</p>
<p>（日聯社馬尼刺十八日電）大會會議之開期迫近、菲律賓支持日本關於改修大會會章提案之態度愈確定、於是日本决定於十九日第一日會議、提出改修第十四條條文中『全體一致』爲『多數决』之議案、日阿部代表特於十八日上午十時會見菲體育副會長巴加斯會談、此事得其諒解、其結果不致發生大會解散等問題、日本改正案如能通過、則日代表繼之提出滿洲國參加問題、以期圓滿通過此案、</p>

<p>意外事、日本在徑賽優勝、並在田賽壓迫他國、然未曾預料之中國選手、在撑竿跳、鐵球、跳高各項、侵入日菲之間、得到分數、可謂中國田徑競技界有進步矣、</p>

<h3>淸水選手問題　日本再提抗議</h3>
<p>（電通社十八日馬尼拉電）高欄比賽日選手淸水之失格問題、審判與監察員會議後、已决定淸永選手爲第三、但菲島陸上選手團抗議反對、致成競技委員會之問題、該委員會於今晨會議、以審判與監察之會議態度、出於輕浮、决定淸水選手失格、於是日本方面再提抗議、要求重賽重審判、</p>
<h3>日選手　紛紛購買土產　日本商店異常忙錄</h3>
<p>（電通十八日馬尼刺電）昨因大雨、全部競技延期一日、各國選手、均得休息一日、日本選手、以至出發馬尼刺之前日止、尙有競技、故均利用此休息之一日、三三五五、散步街上、紛購土產、以爲歸國贈送親友之用、日人經營之商店、因此非常忙錄、大有應接不睱之勢、又日本本部職員出席大會會長奎松之午餐會、午后六時半又將出席中國領事館之晚餐會、</p>
<p>籃球補賽</p>
<h3>我國敗於菲律賓　二十七比三十七差十分　形勢緊張劇烈得未曾有</h3>
<p>（本報馬尼拉十八日專電）中菲籃球昨晚八時舉行補賽之結果、我國不幸以二十七比三十七之比數失敗、上半　菲隊以二十三比十三佔先、雙方交戰之烈、得未曾有因形勢之過於緊張、菲方舉動、似有過火、以致犯規累累、惟我隊因不能鎭靜之故、罰中者甚少、下半時形勢更趨劇烈、菲方之亞阿拿與劉振元一撞之結果、亞之手腕、竟致脱節、我方以上半時失分過多、下半時雖努力反攻、無濟於事、中鋒李震中表演、甚爲滿意出色、</p>

<p>下半時再戰後敵勢未减、左右偷襲、使我難於防備、敵遂一氣驟增八分而我僅由尹鴻祥二罰、獲得二分、形勢始稍轉、李震中繼以遠射命中、復得尹鴻祥之美備於籃下、再度人網、陸續建功、以二十比三十一又稍接近、雙方相持成三十六比三十三、於敬孝入塲代李震中、王錫良入塲代張景實、然而唐寳堃劉振元二罰中中、反被敵加二分、旋劉振元遠投命中一球、無濟於事、菲方粗野性成、一再犯規、經唐實堃于敬孝二罰成三十七比二十七、而時不我　、宣告終結、我遂以二十七比三十七失敗、</p>

<h3>收音機輸出級設計</h3>
<p>— 明襄</p>
<p>收音機輸出級的眞空管，其主要任務，需能輸出最大電工率至擴聲器，以求獲得宏大的音量，完成此目的，必須使擴聲器的有效總阻，與輸出管屏路的交流電阻，成某種一定關係的配合。</p>
<p>爲說明簡單起見，假定接在屏路内的擴聲器，爲單純的電阻，此電阻必須使之與輸出，管交流總阻完全相等，則其電工率爲最大。設輸出管的交流電阻爲１０００歐姆，輸入訉號使屏路產生的電壓爲２０弗打，若此荷載電阻亦爲１０００歐姆，則兩者總值，共爲２０００歐姆，依歐姆定律，求得電流爲１０千分安培，荷載電阻上的電工率爲１２Ｒ＝１００千分瓦特，今若將荷載電阻，改爲任何其他數値，設爲５００歐姆，則電阻總値爲１５００歐姆，電流爲１３·３千分安培，電工率１２Ｒ＝８８·８千分瓦特，此數較前者爲小，卽改爲任何其他數値，其電工率亦必同樣小有１００千分瓦特，所以擴聲器的總阻，必須與輸出管屏路總阻相等，方可獲最大輸出電工率</p>
<p>但擴聲器並非純粹的電阻與磁感迥阻合成的總阻，所以其數値隨週率的高低而變更，不能以數學公式精確的計算之：再收音機的音量，雖愈大愈妙，然對於音質的失眞，自亦不能不顧及，因此二點，實際設計時，以擴聲器在適中週率工作時的總阻，恰等於輸出管交流電阻的二倍，最爲滿意。</p>
<p>不幸現在的擴聲器，音圈的總阻，僅有十餘歐妈，若以之直接與總阻極高的屏路相連，輸出的電工率，自屬小得可憐，所以必須另接一媒介物，或爲扼制圈濾波器，或爲輸出變壓器，以後者最爲通用，配合輸出變壓器初級與次級圈數的比率，可使任何大小總阻的擴聲器，能適用於任何大小總阻的輸出眞空管，而獲得最大的不失眞電力。</p>
<p>計算輸出變壓器圈數的比率，可依下列很簡單的公式求之：</p>
<p>１／２（Ｎ＝２ＲＡ—Ｚ）</p>
<p>Ｎ爲圈數比率，ＲＡ爲輸出管屏極總阻，Ｚ、爲擴聲器總阻。</p>
<p>爲便於讀者實際設計輸出變壓器，特附下表，以作參考：</p>
<p>次級圈數９６１０４７２１０５２１２６７１３００８４６０１１６１６５</p>
<p>圈數比率３１·６１６·３１１·５３８·７２０·０１３·１４４·８２３·１１６·３５０·０２５·８１８·２</p>
<p>擴聲器總阻２·０歐姆７·５１５·０２·０７·５１５·０２·０７·５１５·０２·０７·５１５·０</p>
<p>輸出管屏極總阻２０００歐姆２０００２０００３０００３０００３０００４０００５０００４０００５０００５０００５０００</p>
<p>此表係假定最大輸出　力爲三瓦特，鐵心的横截面積爲一·五平方英吋，</p>
<p>初級圈數，表中雖未載明，可以次級圈數與比率相乘得，第二項擴聲器總阻，雖不容易測得，祇須量其直流電阻兩倍之卽可，繞線粗細，初級應視輸出管屏流大小爲定，次級大約以二十至二十四號爲宜。</p>
<h3>無綫電傳播之束率？</h3>
<p>— 庸言</p>
<p>我們多知道無綫電傳播之速率與『光』之速率相同，卽每秒鐘一八六○○○英里，或三○○○○○○○○公尺。担據近來司篤開夏（Ｓｔｏｋｙｏ）及喬兒司脱（Ｊｏｕａｕｓｔ）二人，對巴黎之科學研究院（ＡｃａｄｅｎｅｙａｔＳｃｉｅｎｃｅｓａｔＰａｒｉｏ）之試騐報告云：彼等實測短波無綫電自巴黎至南美洲之婆諾愛斯（ＢｕｅｎｏｏＡｉｒｅｓ）所需之時間算出，其傳播速率每秒鐘僅一六七○○○英里。若爲長波，則更爲减少，每秒鐘僅一五二○○○英里而已。</p>
<p>此種遲緩。一部份由於電波所取之路徑而起。因電波自發射機發出後，並不盡依地球之表面而行，先斜射至天空，然後再在高空折回地球，一路往返反射，故較爲遲緩也。另一遲緩之原由，則因無論光綫』或『無綫電波』在任何物質中進行時，其速率均較在『眞空』中時爲小也。</p>
<h3>介紹２Ａ５檢波的强力單管機</h3>
<p>— 祺</p>
<p>五極强力眞空管的擴大效力，已早爲無綫電界所稱崇。觀乎今之新式收音機，類多用一級成音週率强放，而輸出聲音已够洪亮，卽爲良好的明證。最近，頗有許多業餘研究者，作五極管檢波的試騐。其成績雖優異，惟亦略有美中不足處，如交流聲之隨音量洪大而刺耳等，實爲憾事。</p>
<p>作者最近曾一度試騐以新式２Ａ５五極强放管作檢波，製成一具半交流單管機，結果較７４更爲滿意，茲特將綫路等介紹如下：</p>
<p>２Ａ５眞空管與４７相似。其燈絲電壓，電流，亦同。惟放大係數較４７猶大一半，且多一陰極，（７Ａ５燈座爲六孔者）</p>
<p>，其接綫可參看附圖）故不易發生交流營營聲。基於此二優點，所以此機音量强大，音質淸晰。收聽本埠各大電臺，均可放揚聲器。</p>
<p>（２Ａ５之燈座）</p>
<p>此機爲求節省費用起見，採用半交流式。Ａ電用電鈴變壓器改繞供給。Ｂ電則用９０Ｖ乾電。如需完全交流，則代乙電整流管用　已可。變壓器計算如下</p>
<p>：</p>
<p>初級２２０Ｖ</p>
<p>次級（１）２·５ＶＸ１·７５ＶＡ</p>
<p>（２）５ＶＸ２５Ａ＝１·２５０ＶＡ</p>
<p>屏電壓（３）１００ＶＸ·０１Ａ·＝１·０００ＶＡ</p>
<p>６·６２５ＶＡ</p>
<p>可以作十瓦特計算。</p>

<h3>初學裝製收音機的要點</h3>
<p>— 江之蕃</p>
<p>本文是爲初進的業餘研究家而作。把個人的經騐，供獻出來：俾初進的業餘研究家，在他裝置收音機的時候，不但不致易於失敗，並且還可得到相當的好效果，增加研究的興趣，現在讓我一一介紹：‘</p>
<p>（一）綫路簡單綫路的選擇，是自製收音機的先决條件，初進者，只宜選用簡單的綫路，而且應該按步就班，由礦石收音機而眞空管收音機，由一燈而至多燈，由直流而交流，由再生式而來復式而超等外差式，由長波而短波而超短波。好高鶩遠，是失敗的種子。愈複雜的綫路，愈需要經騐和學識的。就各種綫路的本身說，也是簡單的『效率』好。初進者只有從簡單的綫路中，才能得到最多的經騐和最好的效果。綫路太複雜，往往因經騐不够，錯誤百出，結果損壞零件，而至灰心。何况綫路複雜，零件增多，經費隨之增加、也不是經濟之道。最重要的就是複雜的綫路，必需要有精確的儀器，才能成功。所以把件所花的費用，和收音的成績來比較一下，事實告訴我們，只有簡單的路的『效率』</p>
<p>好。</p>
<p>（二）選購零件簡單的綫路，優美的零件，再加上小心的裝製，效力不好，我是不相信的。貪便宜，買舊貨，最易上當。尤其是眞空管和變壓器，喇叭等，舊的千萬要不得。何况業餘家是以研</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>究爲目的。今天礦石機，明天眞空管收音機，直流之後用交流，長波做好，改短波。你千萬不要以爲先做個礦石機玩玩，隨便買點便宜貨，裝了起來。要曉得這樣不但你的礦石機成績不會好，你以後要改裝成眞空管收音機的時候，你會發覺你以前所買的便宜貨不適用了。那時候，你當初以爲便宜的，一變而成你的濫費了。並且便宜貨，不經用，結果决不會便宜的。尤其是交流機，短波機，所用的零件非上乘的不可。現在市上劣貨充斥，投國人貪便宜的心理，不惜以極劣的質料，賣最低的價格，我國的業餘家們，其注意及之。</p>
<p>檢查工作誰都曉得，接綫完畢，要加一番檢查工作，免得接綫錯誤，試聽時燒壞零件，這是極重要的。不過還有一番檢查工作常常被一般人所忽略，就是在接綫以前，零件的檢查。我有一次裝一隻五燈機。裝好以後，聲息全無。細細檢查綫路、並無錯誤，眞空營也是完好，不曾斷綫；後來費了二小時，才查出是檢波管的燈座和檢波管的稿極接觸鬆了所致。我自從受了這次敎訓，每裝收音機之前，把零件都細細檢查　過。　如眞空管是否斷綫，可變電容　　是否　，　　電容器絶緣是否可靠　　　　　　　　　　　　　　座接觸是否優良等。零件的檢查，對於愈複雜的綫路愈見重要，業餘家是千萬不可忽略去的。</p>
<h3>無需電源變壓器的强力交流機</h3>
<p>— ＫＭＫ</p>
<p>交流電收音機中的電源變壓器，爲全機中最主要的部份，因多方工作皆由彼所擔任也，在我輩業餘研究界欲自製一收音機尙還可能，但欲自製一電源變壓器殊非易事，因在普通環境下多數未備有應需機械者，如繞線機械等，可是在設計方面，更較麻煩，如本身（電源變壓器）的週率與電源的週率不符，或本身的電流不够全機之需，該皆爲燒毁電源變壓器原因之一，下圖綫路的交流收音機，其特點就是可無需電源變壓器，那末在設計方面可簡便不少，而在耗費方面亦頗較經濟矣！</p>
<p>該機燈絲電壓與Ｃ電高壓，皆直取於電燈電源，</p>
<p>（一百十弗打交流或直流倘使用於二百二十弗打者則電源電綫可改用耗阻線以降低電壓），用電燈泡以配宜眞空管燈絲之電壓（至於牠的瓦特數可試騐更改之又要眞空管燈絲不十分明亮爲度，在電源接上時電燈泡Ｒ卽就明亮，因眞空管絲壓之耗阻力極小也，該機用新式複作用眞空管６Ｆ７任强力檢波兼低放，用１２Ｚ３作半波整流，所以它的靈敏度極高，收聽本埠各電台之播音可無需天地綫，倘用天地綫則可接放揚聲器，效率在普通兩管直流機之上，另件數値述明於后，</p>
<p>Ｌ用二十六號漆包綫在三吋徑蛛網板上繞十圈Ｌ１同上繞六十五圈，Ｌ２繞三十圈，ＲＦＣ用三十號繞一百二十圈，Ｃ爲·○○○五ＭＦＤ，Ｃ１爲·○○○二五ＭＦＤ，Ｃ２爲○○○二五ＭＦＤ３爲·○四</p>
<p>ＭＦＤＣ４Ｃ５Ｃ６皆爲二ＭＦＤ，Ｒ１爲二ＭＥＧ１Ｒ２爲一萬歐姆可變耗阻器，Ｒ３同Ｒ２</p>
<p>Ａ·Ｆ·Ｃ·爲三十亨利二十五（千分）安倍的阻流圈。</p>
<h3>自製電源變壓器時之注意點</h3>
<p>— 陸淸</p>
<p>欲得最大之效率，則變壓器之鐵心損失（Ｃａｒｅｌｏｓｓ），須與銅損失（Ｃｏｐｐｅｒｓ</p>
<p>ｌｏｓｓ）相等。</p>
<p>一中型之變壓器，其鐵心之重量約等於銅之重量之八倍半時，最爲合宜。若一電源變壓器須連績使用數小時者，則銅絲中通過之電流之密度爲每安培一千三百至一千五百圓密爾（Ｃｉｒｃｒｌａｍｉｌｅ）爲最佳。</p>
<p>因渦流損失與銅絲之粗細成正比，故爲减小此種損失起見，變壓器中之銅絲，不宜較應有者過爲粗大。</p>
<p>因鐵心之磁滯損失（Ｈｙｔｅｒｅｓｉｓｌｏｓｒ）</p>
<p>與磁力綫密度（Ｆｌｒｘｅｎｓｉｔｙ）之一·六次冪及電流之週波數成正比；又因渦流損失與磁力綫密度之二次方，及電流之週率數之二次方，及鐵片之厚薄之二次方成正比；故欲减小比種損失，除電流週率因發電機之關係不便改變外，其磁力綫密度在相當範圍去應减小之，同時用爲鐵心之矽鋼片宜採用較薄者。但鐵片亦不宜用過薄者，因過薄則二鐵片間被空氣所佔之部份勢必加大，故普通用之鐵片多爲二十六號或二十八號。　　鐵片之邊緣不可起毛，因若起毛則二鐵片間有藉起毛之處而連成一甚厚之導電體，因而增加渦流損失之患。　　鐵片不宜受灣曲及打擊等，又不宜時常挿入或㧞出，庶不致損壞其面上用以防止渦流之養化物薄層。</p>
<p>鐵片之結合應甚好，俾磁力綫暢行其間。</p>
<p>空間比數（Ｓｐａｃｅｆａｃｔｏｒ卽銅絲所佔之空間與全部可繞綫之空間之比率數。）應大。</p>
<p>所用導綫若較粗大者，則應用絲漆包者，以减免短路之危險。</p>
<p>所用之絶緣布等包全至有相當之絶緣强度卽可，不可過份多包。因過多則内部所生之熱不易外洩，致生危險。　　變壓器之初級及次級應靠得甚近，又須絶緣良好。</p>
<p>夾鐵片所用之螺絲應用銅質而直徑細　　，以减小渦流掦　。</p>

<h3>小經騐</h3>
<p>— 吳善良</p>
<p>（一）甲電將完的現象及補救</p>
<p>普通業餘者用乾電燃燈絲，不久甲電總是要完的，因爲它是一次電瓶，在甲電將完的時候，有一個現象：就是當你把電阻器開足的時候，響音還可以，但是過後響度愈聽愈低，那時你就要換新電池。</p>
<p>若是你用的眞空管是二○一，甲電是四只乾電串連成六弗打，那麽可把電池的地位換一下，卽前後倒置，它的壽命稍可延長。</p>
<p>還有一個方法：就是將氯化錏水溶液倒入用完的電池内，它的電位可稍增，但依我試騐的結果，將溶液倒入紙板式電筒内效力微小，倒入漿糊式電池内效力較佳。</p>
<p>（二）乙電將完的補救</p>
<p>乙電將完時，你把再生圈交連加緊，或增加調節再生力的變量電容器的容量仍不得不嘘嘯之聲或相當的響度，那麽乙電的電位差，必已减至很低。那時你可用整張的香烟錫紙兩張相對，中間隔以玻璃或蠟紙，作較大量的旁路電容器，接在聽筒兩端，聲量可響得多，但電壓降得太低時也是無效的。</p>
<h3>内外消息</h3>
<p>美國無綫電公司史德華收音機銷數奇盛，該公司史德華收音機，爲美國著名史德華廠出品，行銷全世界，已有悠久歷史，在中國由美商美國無線電公司獨家經理。機器堅固，省電耐用，早已口道皆碑，馳譽滿載，茲又有新貨將由傑克生總統號輪船裝運來滬，聞其只質當益精良，而售價並不增高云，該公司又由美國運到大批無綫電另件，及沙而文眞空管，只質高貴而售價亦甚克已云。</p>
<p>天耳無綫電公司仁記路天耳無綫電公司，自接收以前惠勒公司原有修理顧客後，營業非常忙碌，良因新聘修理專家多人，故工作仍能於四十八小時交貨，可謂迅速之至。凡須修理收音機者，不妨駕臨該公司當可滿意也。</p>
<p>法國之廣播事業據最近之統計，法國民衆之裝有收音機者，已達百三十萬之衆。換言之，卽法國民衆百分之三·一爲廣播無綫電之聽衆。總計上述收音機之數當値五萬三千萬法郎。在最近之將來，由無綫電網之推廣及廣播節自之修正，預料廣播聽衆，　大爲增加云。）</p>

<h3>紐約股市與物品齊漲</h3>

<h3>紗花標紗漲力微薄</h3>
<p>紗市略漲、因海外棉市趨高、致人心稍堅、但實需益覺沉悶、華北以運日買去不少、故近來交易停滯、因之賣方絶無抵補之念、市面漲力較弱、惟原棉價格步步向升廠商愈爲艱難耳、</p>
<h3>金鷄紗好五六角</h3>
<p>標紗前市開盤、隨棉市而漲、各月漲四·五·六·七角、午後開盤市氣頗緊、收盤時聞現紗交易不多、又跌三·四角、結果各月祇漲一·三角、全日成交統計一萬二千二百包、查賣出大豐六百五十包、裕康七百包、源大一千五百包、大福七百包、同興四百包、裕大四百包、永昌四百包、</p>

<h3>棉花漲風益熾</h3>
<p>棉市趨堅、且漲風愈演愈熾、以軋空之氣瀰漫市塲、同時美印棉市均漲、人氣更形緊俏、甬帮大量吸收、散空抵補者尤急、惟紗市平澹、現棉廠　尙平云、</p>
<h3>標花再漲三四角</h3>
<p>標花前市開盤、以外棉良好、塲中缺乏重要賣戶、各月均漲二·三角、午後市况仍挺、各月又漲一角、全日成交統計十二萬二千七百查賣出穗隆三千七百担、源大四千六百担賡豐二千二百担、愼昌二千三百擔、仁豐三千九百擔、恊生二千三百擔、永昌二千九百擔、義成二千三百擔、益豐一千七百擔、買進椿記三千四百擔、大豐三千擔、惠康三千八百擔、同興二千一百擔、長和三千六百擔、長豐一萬一千二百擔、吉豐二千一百擔、通記四千擔、愼記三千三百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<h3>美棉交易活潑</h3>

<h3>糧食新麥登塲前標粉麥一致鋭跌</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份又呈鋭跌之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥漲二三角左右、坎拿大跌二三角不等、故開價後、市面雖已見軟、跌度尙覺無幾、惟以後因天時暢晴、新麥前途、當有良好之把握、兼之北路諸帮、因陳麥之廉宜、均無心買進、所以人心大虚、以後卽步步下落、迨至下午開盤、以客銷沉寂、實銷帮一致觀望、大小各廠、對近遠期均有抛售、故市氣復步步下跌、照目下人心、以及環境而言、此種市値、尙有繼續低落之可能、因新麥己近收獲、北銷又少進步、故業中人殊抱殷憂也、結果本月份較跌二分二厘半、六月份跌三分、七月份至九月份跌二分七厘半、十月份跌三分半云、</p>
<p>麥昨日期麥開盤後、各月份呈一致狂落之態、以　洋麥報價、芝加哥與坎拿大各有二三角之漲落、惟目下洋麥上落、市塲殊少注意、因國内新麥轉瞬登塲天時晴雨、未免發生關係、昨因氣候轉暢、且預測小麥節當可無雨、一般人鑒於陳貨之絡繹裝到、廠家之洋麥、又正在卸裝、此後需要、勢必停頓、因此人心、遂見虚軟、遠期開價、亦不能再擯也、結果七八月份跌七分、九月份跌八分、現麥邇日到銷兩活、市頗堅站、昨日福新續辦各路車麥五千包、價開三元、二元九角半、至二元九角不等、</p>
<h3>米市轉懈回跌角許</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源與前相仿、仍以晚稻居多、到近卅號、厚粳及各花色祇十餘號、六千餘石、惟銷塲則轉懈、形勢淸寂、交易寥寥晚稻包胃旣滯、到源復旺、故零胃雖動、終以有限、無濟大局、北洋帮所去之松江貨一　百餘包、及零胃動納之少數泗楓等貨外、餘者如靑泗西練等貨剩下大增、市况垂軟二尺、各厚粳以貨稀、售方極圖扳緊、城鄉作客無意進納、致常帮蘇同帮等貨、俱未能成交、市况無甚上落、惟南港早稻以來貨較多、祇得求脱、結果行情回落近角、杜洋尖及陰變元尙無軒輊、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各帮到埠三十六七號、市上各色銷胃、白粳白元零胃頗呆、羊尖杜尖埠尖略有交易、早薄稻客尖平常、陰元到銷兩平、白粳特高貨價平定、中次白粳及變元早稻薄稻跌一二角、羊尖、杜尖·埠尖價平疲、客尖小數分、陰元無甚上落、</p>
<h3>客元步漲角半　－中次糙到旺回落五分－</h3>
<p>昨客秈市况、本客辦胃仍貪、昨以　本街及内地浙甬爲主、閩帮嫌大觀望、祗去一千五百包、本街内地則去八千五百包、甬帮注意洋米、與内地合辦小　三千包、機　米　日正値季節旺銷本街胃口尤貪、奈河睛到存　少、客貨亦稀、昨本街辦去新到之湖南機　三百包、價又漲角半、售開十元零七角半至十元零五角半、長粒十元零一　、糙機兩米昨日到頭甚多、共計新到六七千包、尤以沙市糙米到存兩多、故中次之沙市糙昨回小四五分、高糙站住、機米存底不多、仍居挺勢、</p>
<h3>黃豆回跌六分强</h3>
<p>昨日津浦路黃豆、因餅不振、廠胃不動、人心虚弱、市價比較漲風時足跌六分外、去路祗有出口厦門帮及本街走化、餘外無問訊、統市成交正陽關豆二車、價爲二元九角九至九角七、及肥河豆三車、價自二元九角半至九角二</p>
<h3>絲茶新繭廠經抛成不弱</h3>
<p>江浙各屬春蠶、轉瞬上市、歐美各莊、鑒於海外存絲漸薄、分起乘賤抛購新繭廠經、而各廠商以今歲改良種蠶汛較優、春繭可望豐收、鮮繭價有每担二十元左右之說、故均依此標凖抛售期絲、成交不弱、計由歐美各洋行曁内地綢商抛成七八等月份新廠經一百四十包、價仍不商、</p>
<h3>蘇浙春蠶汛片片　前日大雨幸祗半日尙無大礙</h3>
<p>（瓶窰）杭屬瓶窰一帶改良　區、今歲農民飼育改良種者多、　　時期天氣太寒、孵化較遲眠後天時寒　無度、三眠中蠶蟻致有　葉失眠情狀損失尙微、大眠時天轉晴暖、發育順利、　帮已出火、晚帮亦均旺葉、前日大雨、幸　上年半日、午後卽晴、且溫度甚高、蠶蟻現狀仍佳、（新登、爐頭胥口及三溪鎭等處、今歲農民孵）育自留之士種者不弱、天時不正、雷雨爲患、早帮蠶蟻大半傾棄、故均補育改良種、注意飼葉、三眠後天氣晴暖、溫濕頗合育蠶之進行、發育轉佳、早帮已大眠旺葉、土種餘蟻無多、經過亦好、前日陰雨半日、而氣候仍暖、尙無大礙、</p>
<p>（丹陽）各市鄉農民自有桑樹之家、均孵育改良種、惜春寒多雨、至孵種愆期、開葉後　雨連綿、忽寒忽熱、稚蠶飼葉、異常注意、幸二眠足葉、天氣晴暢、蠶蟻發育順利、早帮已三眠足葉、晚帮亦開葉、前日大雨爲時甚普、午後卽轉晴暖、影響尙微、</p>
<h3>河口紅茶開盤</h3>
<p>贛省鉛山縣屬之河口紅茶、昨已有新貨上市、英莊錦隆怡和恊和等行、進意均趨濃厚、開出新盤六十五六元、較去年無甚高下、溫州紅茶、售盤已較前提漲三四元、紅茶市面、頗形堅硬、至各路綠茶、昨市各莊行家、對於遂安土莊兩路珍眉、雖因船期迫近、略有補進、然認價尤較前緊局勢似難遽許　觀、</p>
<h3>糖市靑白糖漲跌互異</h3>
<p>昨日糖市、以關金標金均見再降、趨勢　　公會划　二四粗　　、以二十元八角成交　　包、比前日跌去一角、八九號荷赤較高　貨划十五元八角半、太古糖Ｂ嘜呌原價未成交、振記本廠一號白呌十九元三角、亦未做出、潮靑以地價一再轉升、勢甚緊秀、昨市號貨開出六百包之　、漲起一角、計黃崗靑十一元九角至八角、次揭靑十一元五六角、半南靑十一元三四角、隆港靑十一元一角、後續開二百餘包、又升一二角、爲十一元二角至三角、又開出小箱片靑數百箱、價</p>
<p>爲九元四角、前後計升四角、查靑糖存底已屬不厚、地價且緊、後市勢必再升、</p>
<h3>油市柏油跌風漫無止境</h3>
<p>柏油市面、如銀河倒瀉、竟無中流砥柱、據漢市麻城油自跌開十二元五六角後、近又跌十二元二三角矣、雖云高貨不售、所售者均是二三等貨然存底有二萬光景、恐總不能長久相持、故購盤削至十二元進關、一時縱不能　達目的、但後去總恐實現、惟荆枝津挿存貨稍稀、聞曾有每砠十三元進關不售之宜言、所以麻城雖跌、餘尙堅穩、不過皂廠用塲已經絶望、而各處存數尙豐、若全靠燭淘所用、無此巨大去路、且現在燭用夏淘業已落令、往年所賴皂用、今已完全無望、則銷塲之清淡實爲近十年來所無、售　必須　　、故　　　而不售者、實　　　、不得不　者尙　少數　、因此照　市價　　可有一　　　之希望、本埠行家存貨已薄、　　來　尙有、近日客　已跌至十六元稍　、去　不多、交易甚少、浙油尙　、内坪售十五元七八角禾本十六元七八角、</p>
<h3>南北貨湘蓮久疲不振　－漢價已見回好－</h3>
<p>湘蓮以銷路久滯市勢異常疲軟、價乃逐步轉鬆、查市上存底不厚、走塲另　、竟乏整批交易、市面一蹶不振、且此後天氣漸熱、貨身不佳者有變化之虞　勢更難起色惟漢市近已轉升、申市仍疲、高貨不過四十二三元、普通三十七八元、</p>
<h3>五金新鐵絲靜極思動</h3>
<p>新鐵絲以來貨不多、人心甚佳、但實交不旺、市面蕭索、昨溫州福建諸帮俱有大量收辦、市塲趨勢、大有靜極思動之槪其價十六號至二十號每市担估十四元、二十一號至二十五號十七元五角、昨成交一百七八十担之多、銷路連日雖不見多、但定價高存底薄、故來市情形、尙許樂觀也、</p>

<h3>奈何</h3>
<p>— 非心</p>
<p>相傳有過這樣的笑話：王荆公常不洗頭面，面目　黑，非常難看，侍者進澡豆，請他洗臉，荆公説：『天生黑於予，澡豆其如予何』！『其如予何』，翻成白話，便是『將奈我何』！或『將把我怎樣』！孔夫子説過『桓　其如予何』！王莽也説過『漢兵其如予何』！皆是到了沒有辦法的地步，這麽説的　。</p>
<p>如果要在『幽默』項下舉例，這倒是極好的例子。</p>
<p>不過這種氣分，在近代也不多見了，一味崛强，貫澈到底，也略有外强中乾的意味，矯情鎭物的嫌疑。這種話説出了當然使人覺得可笑，然雖到了這種地步而不説出，那情况是多的。</p>
<p>這妙法一經傳佈開去，實行起來，天下就要不平安了。當然，聰明人只當他『幽默』，一笑而已；傻子就會認眞，處處崛强起來，『其如予何』呢？許多地方要使人弄到沒有辦法的。那精義，就是無所畏了。最高的限度不過一死，死後怎樣無從知道，姑不必論，但每人只有一生死，却是的確的。世間事無論眞幻，最</p>
<p>大無過於生死之情。如果有所畏，畏到極致也無非怕死而已。然而孔夫子早不怕死了，王莽也不怕，王安石更不怕，好像説：我生來是這麽一個人，你們這班東西將奈我何呢？所以王安石説：天變不足畏，人言不足恤，祖宗不足法！</p>
<p>時下無論『站在那種立塲』看，中國的確近於危亡，然就正需要一班不怕人，不怕鬼，不怕三敎九流，高文典册，金科玉律，炸彈手槍······的人，擴充仁道的精神，動手救這危亡的民族！</p>
<p>當然，也還得不怕『澡豆』！</p>
<h3>自己介紹</h3>
<p>— 汗靑</p>
<p>近來社會上有一種很時髦的風氣，特别流行於士大夫階級間。這風氣還沒有適當的名稱，姑名之爲『自己介紹』。</p>
<p>翻開報紙來看，我們時常會看到『介紹』的一欄。大抵介紹人多半是社會上知名之士、而被介紹的人十九都是什麽『懷才不遇』，『曲高和寡』的人物。在現代組織複雜的社會裏，人和人的關係斷不像從前閉關時代那麽簡單。『介紹人才』的需要，當不在『介紹書籍』；『介紹東西』的需要下。不過介紹人當老老實實地把被介紹的人的履歷和本領很扼要地叙述出來，不要把陳篇累牘的套語都加在被介紹的人的身上、免得讀者誤會爲他是在看廣告，反將『介紹』的原意失掉了。可是介紹的文字如寫得過火，讀者還可以原諒他的苦衷。因爲我們貴國的同胞最講究體面，寗可虚張誇大，斷不可樸實精當。這就是説，一個人的本領只有五分，你最少也要把他吹嘘到十分。不然，被介紹的人不但不給你道謝，而且會結成無謂的寃家。因此，介紹的文字寫得越漂亮，而讀者的心裏也越給牠打個很大的折扣。</p>
<p>介紹人的文字旣失掉作用，於是一般狡滑者流，又發明一種『自已介紹』的方法。</p>
<p>如説，現在外國有一個大學敎授或作家逝世，他的友生和愛好的讀者，要寫些詩文在報紙雜誌上追悼，本是人『情』正當的表示，毫無非議的地方。可是有一種人在追悼老師的文章裏，要硬派他的老師是當代無雙的聖人，學行兼優，弟子遍天下，簡直是孔子蘇格拉底再生。接着便把死者的學生的姓名按照交遊的先後寫出來</p>
<p>，並自謂本人是死者最得意的高足，彷彿要把自己的地位與顏子和柏拉圖同列。臨了，還在報紙的下面登了一條本人著作集的詳細廣告，聊表『學有淵源』。吁，巧矣哉，『自己介紹』的心理也！</p>
<p>其實，『自己介紹』並不是一件壞事，只要自己拿出眞正本事給人看，人家自然會佩服，用不着徒費唇舌來自吹自擂。我們看毛遂自薦的故事時，心</p>
<p>情只有同情贊羡，覺得他的行動不愧爲英雄本色。他不虚張他的家世是怎樣高明，他不援引他的老師是怎樣聖哲，他不誇耀自己在家族和師友的關係中是佔什麽地位，他只要找個適當的機會來表演自己的本領罷了。</p>
<p>『桃李不言，下自成蹊』。我希望國内的靑年志士努力養成學行兼優的完人，不要妄自菲薄，致陷於『因人成事』的地步。眞正的本領，終久總有人賞識，何必採取這種表彰死人，其實是蓄意提拔自己的妙計呢。</p>

<h3>吊肉香</h3>
<p>— 炎辛</p>
<p>幾個壯漢在菩薩面前，磕了頭，許下心願。</p>
<p>平常荒凉得　現的關武廟裏，這時却熱烘烘地，</p>
<p>男女老壯都到，嚷着，閙着。</p>
<p>壯漢們捋出鐵般地臂膊，站穩了脚，兩兩碰着。初兒輕輕地，隨後愈撞愈凶。咬緊下唇，顯然在拼</p>
<p>命了，全堂就哄笑起來。『嚇！别高興，時辰一到怕就會軟下來咧！』</p>
<p>癩痢頭擠眉弄眼，滑出了嘴。壯漢們還沒伸出拳兒，癩痢已從人叢混走</p>
<p>。</p>
<p>時辰終於到了。壯漢們走進神龕背面去了。大家還是站在堂前，嚷着，閙着。</p>
<p>『他們無非想吃一頓夜飯吧？』</p>
<p>『有錢進腰包啦！』</p>
<p>『呸！是報答娘恩啦！』</p>
<p>種種論調貼在每一個人的口頭。但是，『報娘恩』</p>
<p>的觀念，隱在每人的心裏。據説吊過肉香，娘的養育深恩就算報答了。</p>
<p>『看啦！看啦！出來了啦！』</p>
<p>遠站着的反先喊出了口，打野眼的人，也注視着了。</p>
<p>鐵般地左臂膀密排着鈎，鈎下繫着細線，細線歸綜到一支粗繩，粗繩下面，繫着大銅鑼。足足地把皮吊下三寸。還有繫着笨重地香爐的，連皮帶肉垂了下來。</p>
<p>『阿彌陀佛』，『行手千眼』。老婆婆呶着嘴，唸起佛來了。</p>
<p>壯漢們嚴肅地站在菩薩面前。前三進，後三退。蕩着香爐，打着大鑼。他們凖備出發了。大家爭扎地湧出廟門。嚷着，閙着。鑼聲人聲混在一堆。</p>
<p>壯漢在街市遊行啦！他們碰到道塲人家，就在門前做『三進三退』的儀節。道塲人家設着齋臺，臺上供着偶像。什麽關公啦！岳爺啦！五虎將啦！</p>
<p>ＸＸＸ</p>
<p>這吊肉香，果眞是報娘的恩麽？不，不。依據一種傳説，這算是民族思想的表現哩！傳説是這樣的：『明朝崇禎皇帝吊殺煤山後，漢人就做了滿淸的奴隸。他們屈服在統治者威權之下，祇得飲氣呑聲；有牢騷，祗得借題發揮。這『報娘恩』，就是他們做出忍痛的樣態，表示不甘屈服的英勇的。因此</p>
<p>，他們舉行的時期，是每年三月崇禎吊殺的月份。他們所崇拜的，都是關，</p>
<p>岳。五虎將。等民族英雄一。</p>
<p>這種深入民間的民族運動，在今日，是被取締的了。現在所有的，是智識階級的民族文學，和學生們口中的『抵抗』了！</p>
<h3>吃飯的文章</h3>
<p>— 繩夫</p>
<p>素來看不起文人的湘溪據説現在他自己也成爲文人了。不過，一直到現在止，我却未曾拜讀過他的作品。這大槪是因爲我不知道他用的是什麽筆名的緣故罷。我祗聽得冬生説，他現在不開礦了，因爲生活難過，也祗得替幾家刋物寫些文章，藉以　養活他的妻及三個孩子。但是，這話我早在半年前就聽進耳了，我們終究無緣一晤。</p>
<p>我心中常常想到，他大槪在撰述些關於科學的文字罷。我在有意無意間，也常注意雜誌　紙上的關於科學的文字。不過，這類文字是不能辦别一個人的個性的，因此也就不能斷定，這些文字中那一篇是出於湘溪的手筆。</p>
<p>近月來我又聽到朋友説，湘溪也就同住在西市了。幾次想去一訪，却因相别過久了，不知道這位故人還能相識不？他不是很潦倒麽？他是否有心緒來叙舊呢？這些念頭每次又將我去訪問的心情打碎了。</p>
<p>後來我從冬生口中得到湘溪最近生活狀况，却並不像我想像的壞，據説，他也尙未將我遺忘，也有相晤一談的心願，不過也因爲相别太久，不好造次來的訪似的。</p>
<p>於是，我同冬生先去訪問他。</p>
<p>大槪是因爲我們都是『曾經滄海』的人了罷。相見也是很平淡的。大家叙了一回寒暄，也就找不到其他的話可説了。在這相對默然的時候，我却發現了他的書案上的一束原稿，我於是走近案頭，急欲一翻故人所從事的『勝業』時，他却現出很難爲情的樣子，冷冷的笑道：</p>
<p>『無聊得很，吃飯的文章。』</p>
<p>『你不用客氣。聽説你久改行了。你年來的著作一定很有可觀罷！』</p>
<p>『著作？』他有點惱了，順手將那一束原稿向我一擲，繼續道：『你看了這篇東西，就知道我的一切了。</p>
<p>我忙將原稿紙拉伸，在第一行上看見他用大號字題上：</p>
<p>『元旦試筆』四字·我幾乎爲之茫然，因爲現在隔新年足足還有二十多天，爲何急性乃爾，竟將『元旦試筆』提前寫出？</p>
<p>『你覺得我太無聊了罷！』</p>
<p>他苦笑了。『這是替ＸＸ市』</p>
<p>家雜誌寫的。他們元旦要印出，約我在付印前一星期寄一到，我不得不提前來寫。本來寫這類文字無聊己極，二十年前做孩子的時候，在父親的監督下，是年年要寫一次的。不過，當時確是應景，另有一番愉快的心情，比起現在拏這類文字來賣錢，眞是不可同日而語罷：其實，這也是非意料所及的。』他有點慨然了。</p>
<p>我還有什麽話可說呢。他的『勝業』確在這篇文字中得到說明。我並未將這篇文字唸完。我已看出他心頭是在如何的妻絶，悲冷和憤懣。我將這束文稿裝上封袋裏了，我們都不禁爲之默然。</p>
<p>同時我感着慚愧了。我後悔我們相見時那一套客氣的寒暄，竟有點帶着嘲笑的氣分。我不知故人能諒我不？現在我們又有數十天不相見了。我一想到今年出版界的蕭條，寫文章的題材和地盤也日狹一日，我不能不爲這位孤高的有三個孩子的父母親擔心。不知『吃飯的文章』是否能飽他家五六人的飢腹呢？</p>
<h3>鄉村之夜</h3>
<p>— 毅弘</p>
<p>聽遠處傳來的寺鐘幽玄，舒緩地，</p>
<p>滑過這凝寂的寒江；</p>
<p>寒江底翠波涒鄰地奏着琤琮的音。看西天塗抺着的一片酡紅的光霞，呈着如火災時的回映，顯然地，</p>
<p>畫出了都市底煥煌。</p>
<p>像猙獰的怔忡在陰黝中的魅魑啊！</p>
<p>－－是一族的松子。</p>
<p>幾陣凉爽的微風，</p>
<p>淅淅地，把牠的影子吹亂了，</p>
<p>溜出來陣陣凄惋的　　聲。</p>
<p>深巷的餓犬嘹喨地一聲，</p>
<p>劃破了靜謐的四野；</p>
<p>原來是</p>
<p>竹林深處，緩緩地移動着數盞燈火。</p>
<p>如水樣純潔的大氣中，</p>
<p>時間着數聲村墟的夜春。素淡的月華沐着疎落的茅舍；</p>
<p>疏林裏隱現着幾粒的燈火；</p>
<p>冷冰的四野，織聲和着蟲聲。沉醉在都市裏的人們喲！</p>
<p>可能意想到人間有如許的幽境。只等那晨鷄動野，荷鋤的田父踽踽地彳亍在田塍上的時分，都市的人們喲！許是爲了整夜的勞瘁。正尋打着酣睡中的夢味。</p>
<p>五·十·於杭州</p>
<h3>歐靜麗Ｅｕｇｅｎｉｅ（四）</h3>
<p>— 白韋</p>
<p>兩方面整個拒絶，並不使玄灰心，他早已發誓要排除一切困難、終生保有歐靜麗！不過歐靜麗方面却不同了，她是十足地具有女性的實際主義的！她不願過分違背她母親的意思，她雖是不信宗敎的，却不願一個宗敎的處罰，使她家庭在鄰里前，减少風光。她知道一般世俗的人們，是沒有方法可以使他們了解她自身的情形的。玄勸她索性抛棄了家庭，她不肯接受這個意思，她主張緩進政策：他和她還年靑；她要得到母親的同意，敎長的特許以　後，才和玄訂婚。玄的雄辯不能改變這女孩的固執！於是婚約的一回事，便暫時停頓下來。目前，無論如何，他倆總是享受着人世間可能的美滿的生活！他倆又第二回同度過了冬季和春天，歐靜麗還是那樣嬌美溫婉，和玄第一天會見她的時候一樣！</p>
<p>第二學年的考試又快要到來。這是歐靜麗大學本科最後兩張文憑的考試。玄一想到這可咀咒的暑假，不容情地迫近了，又得把他的歐靜麗送去，他惶急起來。</p>
<p>『歐靜麗，下學年你還來讀研究院嗎？』他倆同侍在小花園裏的木凳上，濃綠的榆葉　覆着他倆。</p>
<p>『不一定。我最初只和家庭約定，兩年讀完四張文憑的，並不曾談到取得學士學位以　後。再讀研究院，因爲那時根本不能料到兩年究竟能否考過四張文憑不能呢。我這回到家。自然和家庭商量，再來讀研究院。親愛的，我如何能長久地　開你！我想，我還要返巴黎的！』</p>
<p>『假若你家庭爲離隔我倆起見，竟不許你再來呢？』玄懷疑地問。</p>
<p>『便是這婚事，我也預備回家進行去。』她很有把握似地説。</p>
<p>『進行不成功呢？』</p>
<p>歐靜麗沒有立刻回答。玄舉起她的右手，送到嘴邊去舐吻，眼涙滴在她掌上。『那也不要緊！我一達到法律上的成年，我便可以自由地到巴黎來，我的父母不復能拘管我。我便同你到中國去。好不好？』歐靜麗安慰玄，抱攏他的頭，在他額上親吻。</p>
<p>『那時候我倆就結婚了？』</p>
<p>『那又不同。那時候我雖然可以自由和你同來同去，却只是我』個人的遊歷一樣。結婚却不行的！你想：我一和你結婚，牧師又和我家庭不干休了。我父親倒無所謂，我母親一定忍受不下鄰里的　笑的。你不知道我母親對於鄰里是如何保持着種尊嚴呢。</p>
<p>『照你説，我倆將來可以同居，而沒有方法結婚，就像現在一樣。』</p>
<p>『結婚的方法是有的：或者得到敎長的特許；或者我母親死去。』</p>
<p>『多麽矛盾的社會啊！』玄嘆息了。</p>
<p>歐靜麗忙着考試的時候，這問題沒有再被提起。勝利地通過考試以　後，她在巴黎休息了幾天，便和玄去遊歷柏林。她預備從那裏到維也納，趁船回國。</p>

<h3>談言『婦女國貨年』果失敗了嗎？</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>不必勞日文報來冷嘲熱諷，我們也早就知道所謂『婦女國貨年』是和『打倒帝國主義』一樣，不過是一種喊喊好聽，助助熱鬧的空口號而已，豈眞便能挽救這垂危的中國。中國摩登婦女之擯棄國貨，崇尙外貨，本是毫不足怪的，因其旣爲摩登，自然惟摩登的物品最能稱心合意。誰知一般多事的熱心提倡國貨者，偏要舉行這麽一個『婦女國貨年，』來苦勸她們服用國貨，且利用一個『愛國』的名義，冀能以打動她們的良心。結果不惟於事無補，反而落得給敵人嘲笑我們説：『國民政府盡其能力，利用所有宣傳機關，提倡國貨，特所謂婦女國貨年之口號，其期望成績，全歸泡影，何則，溯自正月以來，迄今己届四月有半，而本年度第一季之輸入超過額，爲一億六千萬元，按照數字而言，内中情形，一見可知，卽輸入之舶來品，大部分多在都市中消費，其間十之五六，全爲摩登婦女階級之裝飾消耗品，因此雖以提倡國貨之口號相號召，但婦女們的心中，則依然不問不聞，莫怪婦女國貨年之全歸失敗耳。</p>
<p>『婦女國貨年』的失敗，其原因的確在於『婦女的心中，則依然不問不聞，』</p>
<p>然而我們要提倡國貨，並不以婦女爲限，更並不以摩登婦女爲限，我們的目的，是在期望全國四萬萬同胞，能够一心一意，個個起來實行。我們之所以定訂今年爲『婦女國貨年』，只不過是想給婦女界以一個刺激，呌她們覺醒，其實也沒有多大用意。而且我們敢相信，我國提倡國貨的口號，雖然收效甚鮮，説半點影響也沒有，則又未必，我們只要看看近來上海一埠幾家國貨工廠和國貨商塲的勃興氣象，便可推想得到。所以我們以爲嘲諷儘管他們去嘲諷，提倡還是盡我們自己的力量來提倡。用一分努力，卽可收一分成績。本此信念，我們甚願熱心國貨運動的人士，繼續奮鬥下去，以達到我們最後的目的。</p>
<p>不過我們要提倡國貨，應脚踏實地苦幹下去，才得有效果，非弄什麽新花樣所能爲功。我們最宜注意的，是在國貨的改良和發明。改良可以使國貨由劣變優，和舶來品比美，發明可以製造出新貨物，和舶來品競爭，如此，國貨卽不提倡，國人也無有不樂用的。我們幾曾聽到英法德或日等國在提倡國貨，然而英美法總或日的人民、大都是喜用其本國的國貨的。可知國貨不在提倡，而在有優良的國貨給人民享用。</p>
<p>最後我們還得在這里來向中國一班摩登婦女進一言，中國如再不思振作，亡國是必然的結果，亡國的慘禍，不久便會在我們的眼前實現出來。怎樣振作，這端賴全國人民的覺醒，共赴危難，以挽回頽局。用服國貨，本是國人應有的本分。你們果尙存有一點愛國心，請從此起，來替國家盡一分義務。你們試想一想，敵人一面用經濟侵略的手段來亡我國，一面又在那里大放冷語，笑我國人沒有愛國心，對於這，你們覺得怎樣呢？眞敎我們痛心呵！</p>
<h3>中國婦女的前途</h3>
<p>— 波兒</p>
<p>我覺得，婦女問題是中國社會最大問題之一。站在人口的統計方面來説，我們不是有四萬萬同胞嗎？可是，在性的類别上，那末婦女是佔着半數了。但，連年的内戰，在砲火的陣綫上，中國不是犧牲了許多許多的男性嗎？在生理方面，我們再來考察一下，女性是多半弱於男性的，因爲在因　的重男輕女的社會裏，一切的問題，都以男性爲中心。所以，婦女方面漸漸地失了她們本能了，她們只幹些家庭内的細微的瑣碎的工作，結果，在康健上她們是比男性爲優的至少，她們是不必像男子那麽苦勞，她們沒有擔憂生活上的重大的責任，她們沒有受過像男子那般極度的操勞。所以，中國的婦女底壽命，往往是比男子長呢。由這種的情態來推測，中國的婦女是多於男子的，我以爲不會有錯誤罷。</p>
<p>基於這點的論斷，那末，佔着中國社會大半人口的婦女，顯明是一件十分重大的問題了。</p>
<p>可是，在這個畸形的社會制度下，女子是被蔑視的，被壓迫的，被剝削的，被排擠的，被禁錮於黑暗的地層的深處。</p>
<p>因此，婦女的悲劇日益加深了，在這無涯的痛苦底生活裏頭，女子不是受過了幾千年來的非人生活嗎？</p>
<p>在詩經『斯千』一首詩裏，我們來舉個例證罷：『乃生男子，載寢之牀······，家室君五···乃生女子，載寢之地，無非無儀，唯酒食是議，無父母詒罹···』</p>
<p>這分明，把女子當草艾，丢棄於地，總之女子是被擯棄，被蹂躪的了。然而，另一方面來説，一般太太小姐門的豐衣足食，過其浪漫豪闊的生活，這只是一種甘自墮落的現象，我們不能説她們是如何如何悲慘？</p>
<p>所以，我的論點是以廣大的勞苦婦女大衆爲中心。她們的生活是人間料想不到的黑暗，她們是受封建勢力的殘踏，有男性的虐待，在這些的重重壓制底下，中國婦女的前途，是會形成怎樣一個結果呢？向死裏日益埋沒了她們的生命！</p>
<p>所以，爲了毁滅這種不幸的悲劇，爲了爭得『男女平等』，爲了解放和自由，爲了權利，爲生存······那末，婦女必須要爭鬥起來，我們應該自信自己是『人』，並不是奴隸，並不是生來爲男子的所有品，更不是他們的玩具呢！</p>
<p>在思想方面，我們要努力洗脱了那些惡劣的殘舊觀念，養成一種科學的新時代的意識。在實際的實踐方面，我們要加倍的學習和爭取政治上經濟上敎育上枝術的……種種權益。這樣，我們才能走向光明的前途啊！</p>
<h3>五月底風</h3>
<p>— 蕙人</p>
<p>天色己夜了，沒有月亮，沒有星點，</p>
<p>黃浦江裏吹來的風啊，怪軟地沒有刺激，沒有芬芳。慘淡的電燈光照出了每一物件的輪廓，影子是瘦長的。江水無力的在擊拍着，音調是異常的沈悶。心田憂鬱地，像夜色一樣；望着朦朧的輪船，在想着故鄉啊！那裏有着甜甜的櫻桃，顏色是紅得可愛；還有那帶一點苦味的海水啊，曾洗着我底身體；</p>
<p>還有着堅强的眼珠，堅强的肐膊；還有那五月的風勢是猛烈的，空氣帶有着一點淸香；還有，那·········我相着啊，像在夢裏。</p>
<p>印在腦海裏的瑛姑娘。</p>
<p>白菓樹已經綠綠地生滿着葉子，在溫暖的風吹下，發出一陣陣有規律的充滿着詩意的聲息。我平臥在樹底下麗着早晨的日光，聽着樹葉中間的鶯語，看着頭領浮雲的飛駛：我唱着啊，那沒有節奏的拍子，微笑常常掛在嘴邊，我幸福着啊，在大自然的懷抱裏！</p>
<p>從東面的竹林裏忽然有着一聲尖鋭的呌喊，我跑過去看着，看着有什麽事件發生。是一個美麗的姑娘　在地上，裙子已經撕破了，臉色是怪模樣的灰白</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>，手背上有一絲絲的血在流着。我用着手帕替她把創口輕輕地紥住，把帶來的熱水袋灑了一杯開水給她喝；神志一點點的淸楚了，臉色慢慢的在轉紅，眼珠也在活動了。</p>
<p>『什麽事，姑娘』？我輕輕地問着。『···········』那蘋菓般的臉是現出一陣羞紅，低下了頭在按摩着那隻滿手汚泥的手腕。</p>
<p>『倒底什麽事啊，姑娘』？我顯示出一點不煩。</p>
<p>『從樹上跌下來』，用手指着那一顆樹。</p>
<p>『怎樣會爬到樹上去的呢』？</p>
<p>『我愛着那樹上的鳥窠，裏面有着卵子呢』！</p>
<p>『但怎跌下來的呢』？我感覺到一點興趣的問着。</p>
<p>『那樹椏子上有着，有着·····一條小靑蛇啊』！臉上還現出驚慌的神態。『哈······哈······有趣，你受傷了沒有』？我不禁的笑着。</p>
<p>她搖了搖頭，表示並沒有受痛，並低下了頭天眞的笑着。</p>
<p>那時起我便熟識了她，知道了她的名字呌做瑛，那美麗的名字啊，我輕輕地淰着。她有着堅强的眼珠，堅强的肐膊，那被海水和日光曬黑了的手臂，發出一層亮亮的光彩。我們時常在白菓樹底下咬着櫻子，談着遙遠的故事；她那頑皮的性子，使我常用樹枝打着她的手心，那時她會逃往竹林裏躱住笑着，我便追着。這樣我們天天把光陰化在天眞</p>
<p>的淘氣裏。</p>
<p>我把無形中各自戀着了，我有一天不看見那頑皮的笑臉時，我便會一天做不得事。我想對她説：『瑛，我愛你啊』</p>
<p>！我也想寫一封信給她，以表示我心中的燃燒，但我見了那隻活潑的笑臉啊，我便失去了勇氣，在心間我會感覺得到自慚。</p>
<p>但是無情的六月輕輕地悄悄地降到了人間，我要回南去了啊，回到這無情的上海。</p>
<p>『瑛，别了』！像有一團棉花塞住了我的心間一樣。</p>
<p>『不要忘記給我帶些南方的故事來啊』！眼珠仍是那麽地堅强，沒有留戀，沒有悲哀。</p>
<p>『好吧，你給我帶來故鄉的故事一樣』。</p>
<p>輪船一點點的離開了堅强的風土，望着那揮着手的影子一點點的淡下去。五月的風啊，已悄悄地又降到人間，我望着迷朧的輪船想信故鄉的風啊，那醉人的風，給我帶走吧，到那甜蜜的故鄉！</p>
<h3>襲尹霞女士的死因（續）</h3>
<p>— 魏慈</p>
<p>由此，我們可以説，龔女士的痛苦是社會給予的，龔女士的生命是自己斷送的，追究起來，這事件的本身責任，還是要由龔女士自己負擔。社會環境旣已不適合我們的生活要求了，我們就要拒絶牠，並改造牠，這就是革命的根源，社會進化的起點。譬如多數個人的貧窮，是社會釀成的，然而由貧窮迫成的盜竊行爲，却還是應由個人負責，這在現行社會制度裏固屬是犯罪的行爲卽依社會主義的理論來説，他們亦應大家一致起來積極的求有以改造社會，不應以消極的個人主義用盜竊手段解决一時的生活問題。</p>
<p>龔女士的自殺是錯了。我希望由龔女士的死，一方面使婦女界能起來舊事重提的再做一點提高婦女在社會心理中的地位的工夫，消潔大家庭組織的潛勢，肅淸封建思想所加於女性的遺毒。這話説來似太陳腐太平淡，若大家肯去新舊家庭中實際體察，便可知這勢力在社會在家庭中所加於女性的虐待之嚴重性了。在另一方面却希望凡受着外來刺激－－不論精神的物質的，使得心靈疲弱到無力自持惟想着自殺的人們，請趕快將你的頭腦冷靜下來，反省到自己其所以不堪壓迫和痛苦並找不着一條出路的原因，完全是因爲自己對事認識未淸，理解未透，才無力救助自己，才無勇氣提負自己的責任，並非社會上眞沒有你的出路，不信，請看龔尹霞就是一例－－她是自己阻塞了自己的出路。（完）</p>
<h3>打拳的哲學</h3>
<p>— 白榕</p>
<p>我們打人家一拳，往往可得到下列三種不同的結果：</p>
<p>（一）把那人打倒了。</p>
<p>（二）那人回敬一拳，把你打倒了。</p>
<p>（三）那人完全不　睬你。</p>
<p>第一種是足以證明你的力氣大，可以博得人們的讚譽與欽佩，第二種雖然失敗，可是至少還足以證明你有相當的力氣，你這一拳竟能刺激對方，引起反應，只有第三種，打上去的時候，不痛不癢，人家的淡漠正足以證明你的無力，可以説是失敗之尤，所以我們可以大膽地説上一句，打拳而得到第三種結果的　可以説是全無出息。</p>
<p>自己懂得打下去不會有結果、知難而退地畏縮起來，雖然如糊紙老虎一樣可憐，可是至少還可以在别人面前綳綳架子。打下去是會露出自己本相的，你不打，人家當然無從測知你的眞相是什麽樣子。在自己的眞相還沒給人家猜破的時候，暗暗地磨拳擦掌，靜候時機，一旦元氣旺盛，功夫純熟，掄手朝那人要害砸上一拳，卽使沒打倒地，至少要引起他喊兩聲『啊呀！』，或是轉身照樣回敬你一下，這樣，纔不失爲聰明的辦法。</p>
<p>從前有人説：『外交當有武力爲後盾』，又説：『弱國無外交』，在目前形勢上考查起來，這兩句話還是把捉住一部份的眞理的。最近日本人在天津八里台造飛機塲，我國又開始抗議了。在過去，抗議的把戲似乎與我們非常熟悉。大槪自從中日有了關係以來，我們就不斷地做着『抗議』的功夫，然而也只是抗議而已。緊張的面容和揮舞的手勢往往因了對方的淡漠而鬆弛下來。過去的歷史已經給我們以深刻的敎訓：爲什麽我們抗議人家不來答理？爲什麽别人的抗議就是那麽有力？這問題的焦點在怎麽地　？能够認淸這問題而　以解答，退一步培養自己潛力的，纔是一個弱者最適當的辦法。否則東抗一下。西抗一下，弄得人家毫無影響，而自己精力俱疲，氣血交虧，結果是可憐的束手待斃，那纔眞是不識時務的大傻瓜。</p>
<p>打拳不是容易的事。怎樣去打？怎麽時候去打？打誰？什麽地方是他的要害？都關係全局的勝負，揮舞拳頭的人，曾否對這加以一度冷靜深切的思慮呢？</p>
<h3>弗如意傳（五）</h3>
<p>— 忘我</p>
<h3>無垠缺陷</h3>
<p>— 列火</p>
<p>至少，在過去與現在理想與事實是嶄然的兩回事，絶不能印證和諧，而是相承相生，如影隨形的幻離着，始終成爲一個謎。</p>
<p>但，很有些説，理想是事實之母，是事實的先導，那是他們活把『人』與『環境』看作似一個雕刻的石像，是靜的，是死的，忽視了『動』中演進的意義，正如天象的風雨晦明，人間，魔術幻燈，一些兒都捉摸不住。</p>
<p>這輩人，爲着要證明他們的理論眞實可靠，慣把一些不甚落實的事情拿來做考證，力圓其説，有時候也彷彿説得很像，比如『民國』是辛亥革命以前的理想，辛亥以後，『民國』畢竟成了事實。太平天國肇事之始，不獨是滅淸復明『而且飽含有社會主義的思潮，如『打富濟民』等口號，可見一斑。就是分子之間，當時也是緊相策應，毫無介蒂，儼然可以完成理想似的。可是後來怎樣呢？到了江山垂成，奠都金陵時，理想就成了一縷暮烟似隱消了。誰都忘了他的使命，幾個首領，只顧利害的傾軋，明爭暗鬥，結果是自相殘殺，白送給曾左彭一個大獻身手的機會。所謂太平天國，就如一朶　花。盛衰之暫，每使後之作史者椎胸無語。</p>
<p>就説現今的事，『九一八』以來，『抗日救國』是一個理想，大槪誰都有這麽一個理想，只除了甘冒不韙的鄭老狗等以外，其餘如主張『五十年』『十年』後而談『救國』的洋聖人老博士，也都總有這麽一個理想。但事實却偏偏中途起了歪曲，陳擺在我們眼前的一切，實在是痛心得很。</p>
<p>理想原來是怎樣也追踪不上事實呵！</p>
<p>這是人類社會中的無垠缺陷。</p>
<h3>喜峯口下一齣民間悲劇</h3>
<p>— 洋洋</p>
<p>喜峰口在華北地勢上，爲兵家所必爭，牠也是長城重要口隘之一，記得直奉兩次内戰，都曾在此處留下莫大的戰績，大樹將軍好像也在其地高揭倒戈旗幟，而發明中華軍閥叛主通敵之風，然在九一八後，宋哲元先生抗日之役，大戰長城間，鏖兵於喜峯口，砲火接天，血肉相搏，尤其器械不精，後無接濟，士卒忍饖耐寒，仍與敵人作殊死戰，其不朽精神，眞能動天地泣鬼神，而爲中華民國對外作戰歷史上留得最光榮之一頁，且爲東北失陷以來差强人意之一頁，尤可見我國軍人並非完全勇於私鬥，而皆對外無抵抗行爲也，昨偶讀元代詩人的一首詩，也是叙述喜峯口的故事，相傳宋未元初有一閩籍靑年士兵，出塞投軍，相從元太祖輾轉作戰，數載杳無消息，其父念子情殷，遂由家鄉跋涉四方，以尋其子，及至喜峯口，居然被他找到，父子一旦相見，樂極生悲，抱頭痛哭，不料一慟俱絶，大約父子二人之精神與軀殼皆含有莫大痛苦，一個間關萬里，一個從軍十年，其心靈上的悲哀和身體上的痛創，皆必密密層層的裏着，所以目的旣達，痛定思痛，就一蹶不可復振了，當時那靑年士兵的主將，發現這幕悲劇，很想替他父子留個紀念，除將他二人屍骨埋葬立碑述事外，特命名其戍地爲『喜逢口』，俾後人顧名思義，得知所以，但是年湮日久，未知如何，改『逢』稱『峯』，地名訛傳，猶其小事，惟此慈父一番天倫之愛，竟永遠埋沒不彰，的確是椿憾事，還有一件可惜的事，這父子倆的姓名未傳，本來他倆的地位太小，中國人從前思想，完全封建化，就因地位太小，又有何人去注意這齣有價値的民間悲劇？如今因事誌名的地方，尙且更改掉，不要説他父子倆的墓與碑自然格外無遺跡可搜尋咧，所幸還有一位姓許的詩人不辭勞苦，曾作同情的悲哀，留了這樣的一篇文字，尙可供給我們想像悼呢詩曰：</p>
<p>『兒解寒衣重撫摩，兒飢推食孰忍呵？長城與國遠負戈，一去不返當如何？去時云出東北鄙，直出榆關度遼水；白頭郎罷與影俱，豈憚山川千萬里。天敎此地適相逢，父曰從天墜吾子，笑疲樂極俱殉身，誰復鍾情遽如此！官家開邊方未已，同生又别寗同死，山雲漠漠風颼颼，山頭雙塚知幾秋？當時不忍一朝　：今日　成千載愁。猶　貞女化爲石，終古孤身　不得！淸江寒影日悠悠，行人一去無消息。』</p>

<h3>Transformation of British Far East Policy: Labour Leader Criticizes Government's Appeasement of Japan; Conservatives Still Nostalgic for Old Alliance; Foreign Secretary Simon Explains Nine-Power Treaty, Saying "Respect" and "Guarantee" Are Clearly Different</h3>
<p>(London) During today's parliamentary session, Labour leader Clement Attlee spoke, criticizing Japan's policies in the Far East.</p>
<p>The Labour leader's speech denounced Japan, insisting that Japan had begun to implement imperialistic expansion, and Japan's ambition was aimed not at Russia, but at China. Attlee continued that Russia's strength was substantial, so the ambitions of Japanese militarists to penetrate Siberia and reach Lake Baikal seemed somewhat suppressed, and they turned their focus to North China. It is generally recognized that Japan wants to establish a second "Manchukuo" in North China. Will Britain continue to tacitly allow its interests in China to be divided by Japan? It should be known that once Japan annexes North China, it will prepare to gradually encroach upon South China and expel the European powers. It is rumored that Japan has used sweet words to lure Turkey into joining the German-Japanese alliance. If so, a group opposing the League of Nations may be formed, backed by the power of Japan and Germany. During Attlee's speech, Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi and other dignitaries were sitting in the audience.</p>
<p>Conservative members frequently express goodwill towards Japan. Conservative MP Keyes then claimed that the Singapore naval base should not be regarded as a threat to Japan, but is closely related to the defenses of New Zealand and Australia. He always regretted the termination of the Anglo-Japanese alliance. If we could reach a thorough and good understanding with Japan, it would be very beneficial to the interests of the Empire and the British in the Far East.</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Simon, regarding the Nine-Power Treaty and Britain's intention to tear it up, spoke in the House of Commons at 1:37 this afternoon, saying that although Japan's semi-official statement has caused anxiety in many other countries, it is the British government that is negotiating. Since Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota has given a solemn guarantee to British Ambassador Lindley, how can he say to a friendly government, "I don't believe it"? No country has undertaken to use its military force to maintain the territorial integrity and political independence of China. The Nine-Power Treaty only speaks of respecting territorial integrity. Respect and maintain are clearly different. As for whether the League of Nations' handling of the Far East issue is inappropriate, opinions vary. Everyone has their own views.</p>
<p>Reform the League of Nations by first seeking to resolve disarmament. Simon then discussed the reform of the League of Nations, saying that he and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini are both willing to reconsider the League of Nations Covenant. They believe that if this matter is mixed into the already troubled disarmament discussions, it may not lead to a compromise. Any amendment to the Covenant should allow Germany to participate. Britain intends to do its best to help resolve the disarmament issue.</p>
<p>Unwilling to easily implement economic sanctions. Britain is currently closely studying the issue of economic sanctions, but such sanctions, if implemented rashly, will inevitably lead to war. Sanctions should not only be applied to weak countries, but must also be applied to strong countries. Economic pressure, without strength, is ineffective. We deeply appreciate the contributions that the United States has made to the improvement of international affairs, but it must be known that the future actions of the United States have their own scope. It is useless to speculate beyond this scope.</p>
<p>Simon then spoke of the situation in Geneva, refuting the general view that "we have reached the end of a tragic and adventurous undertaking and should strike our tents." He said that if we achieve nothing, the harm to the world would be unimaginable. Simon then added that Great Britain has always been a leader, aiming to achieve disarmament. If the current attempt at disarmament unfortunately fails, it must be followed by new efforts. Simon's speech lasted for an hour, and he then answered Attlee's questions, saying that Great Britain naturally supports the League of Nations' report on the Far East incident and will never deviate from it without proper notice. Simon's last words were, "As long as we are bound by the Nine-Power Treaty, we will do everything in our power to abide by it."</p>
<p>(Reuters telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) The House of Commons debated the Japanese issue fiercely today. Foreign Secretary Simon strongly defended the government's policy toward Japan and replied to the angry questioning of the members, saying that he now wanted to draw the attention of the members to the fact that although Britain had expressed respect for the territorial integrity of China, Britain had not made any guarantee to maintain that integrity. During the debate, Liberal and Labour members accused the government of encouraging Japan's expansion in the Far East, and the British government's response to Japan's declaration of policy toward China was also severely criticized. Labour leader Clement Attlee began today's debate by saying that Japan had posed a serious threat to peace in the Far East and to peace throughout the world. Mr. Cazalet said that, in view of Britain's own actions elsewhere in the world, it is difficult for us to cast the first stone at Japan. The proposed sanctions will not only lead to an Anglo-Japanese war, but will also lead to a Japanese-American war, so we should not threaten Japan. Admiral Keyes advocated a compromise with Japan, saying that Japan inevitably occupies a large part in Eastern affairs and is determined to move forward, so I advocate that the British government should understand Japan well. Then, the agreement on air force disarmament was discussed. Lord President Baldwin made a shocking statement, saying that this agreement must stipulate sanctions against any country that violates it. Such sanctions will inevitably lead to war, so if we want to impose sanctions, we must prepare for war. At present, Britain is already carrying out preliminary plans to expand its air force. Baldwin acknowledged the seriousness of the world situation, but remained confident that Britain would not face any danger in the near future. Baldwin also said that if we want to implement collective security sanctions, we must put Britain in a stronger position. This afternoon, Foreign Secretary Simon also stated in the House of Commons that the failure of the Disarmament Conference is inevitable, but this is not the end of the world. On the day of the disarmament breakdown, we should immediately open another path to devote ourselves to this. It seems too foolish to say that disarmament is like an "anointing ceremony," because Britain will still seek salvation in future conferences (Simon's so-called future conference refers to the League of Nations' General Disarmament Conference on May 29). However, at the next meeting, Britain will no longer put forward proposals, but will only clarify Britain's previous suggestions and ask the representatives of other countries if they have better ideas.

<h3>New Japanese Policy Towards China: Ariyoshi's Return to Post to Lead to Developments</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The American-run Japan Advertiser stated in today's editorial that the reason why the Japanese Foreign Ministry issued a statement on April 17 prohibiting others from interfering in China was because it knew that the powers were currently considering some concrete methods to revive China. If Japan refuses third countries to assist China in the name of the League of Nations, then it must be able to give China what it does not allow China to receive from other countries' assistance. The Japanese government now seems prepared to do so. Soon, Japan may have its Minister to China, Ariyoshi Akira, announce Japan's action plan. (Reuters telegram, 18th)</p>
<h3>Question of Opium in Manchukuo: British Foreign Secretary Simon Answers Member's Question</h3>
<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Simon answered a question from Labour MP Grenfell in the House of Commons today, saying that the League of Nations Opium Committee has not issued a report on the establishment of a state monopoly on opium in the northeastern provinces of China under Japanese military occupation. The British government abides by the recommendations of the Opium Advisory Committee, strictly examines applications to transport narcotics into Manchuria and Jehol, and abides by its obligations under the Hague Peace Convention. (Reuters telegram, 18th)</p>
<h3>Japanese People Are Overly Sensitive: Sino-Russian Secret Agreement Is Groundless</h3>
<p>According to the TASS news agency's inquiries from all reliable sources, the report transmitted by the Moscow Japanese Union News Agency that the Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Yan Huiqing, now in Beiping, and the Soviet diplomatic representative in Beiping have concluded a secret agreement on Inner Mongolia is obviously completely nonsense. (TASS telegram, 17th)</p>
<h3>Litvinov Arrives in Geneva: New Developments in the Issue of Russia's Accession to the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov will arrive here tonight and will immediately meet with French Foreign Minister Barthou to discuss everything. It is said that what they will discuss is the issue of Soviet Russia's accession to the League of Nations, so it is expected here that important developments will occur soon. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov has arrived here today. Although he came for the disarmament issue, he has once again aroused general attention to the possibility of Soviet Russia joining the League of Nations. Litvinov is scheduled to meet with French Foreign Minister Barthou this afternoon, and then will visit the League of Nations Italian representative Aloisi and the British representative Eden. Although there are still major difficulties to be eliminated, it is believed that various issues can be resolved satisfactorily at the League of Nations General Assembly in September. Poland and Spain are now advocating that if a permanent council seat is given to Soviet Russia, then this seat should also be given to the two countries. Poland also demands that the rights of minority ethnic groups in treaties should be made universal. It is said that Soviet Russia wants to be invited to join the League of Nations to avoid applying itself and being opposed by others, which would be embarrassing. (Reuters telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>League of Nations Technical Cooperation Council</p>
<h3>Passed the Rajchman Report: Confirmed Cooperation Methods to Help China's Construction, Distributed to Technical Agencies for Research, Ambassador Gu Refuted Japan's Unreasonable Opposition, Praising Rajchman for Fulfilling His Responsibilities</h3>
<p>(Geneva) On the afternoon of the 17th, the Administrative Yuan's China and League of Nations Technical Cooperation Committee passed the Rajchman Report. The committee will convene another meeting after the League of Nations' various technical organizations have studied the report. (Central News Agency telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign news: The China Technical Cooperation Committee held a meeting on the 17th. Our country's representative, Gu Weijun, delivered a speech, the main point being that Rajchman's report was considered faithful and served within the scope of the powers conferred by the League of Nations. This speech refuted the unreasonable opposition of the Japanese side. (Special telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Yuan Technical Cooperation Committee held a meeting and passed the following resolution: The Administrative Yuan Technical Cooperation Committee held a meeting on the 17th to study the Rajchman Report and the detailed documents of the technical representative's work in China from the time of his appointment to April 1 of this year. Rajchman made a brief presentation on the development of technical cooperation between China and the League of Nations. During the exchange of views, the Chinese representative conveyed to the committee the Chinese government's special gratitude for the services of the technical representative and other experts in China, and pointed out that the Chinese government regarded the technical cooperation with various countries through the League of Nations as valuable. The Administrative Yuan Technical Cooperation Committee is aware that the implementation of cooperation between the League of Nations and China is in accordance with the resolutions of May 31, 1931, April 3, 1932, and the Administrative Yuan Technical Cooperation Committee of July 18, 1933, and is pleased to know that the cooperation methods stipulated in the resolutions have benefited China's construction work. The Secretary-General should be requested to forward the technical representative's report to the League of Nations' various technical agencies, and the technical representative should provide all necessary information to the relevant technical agencies and the relevant departments. The Secretary-General should also forward the opinions of the technical agencies to the Administrative Yuan Technical Cooperation Committee at the appropriate time. This report should also be distributed by the Secretary-General to the member states of the Administrative Yuan. (Central News Agency telegram, 18th)</p>
<h3>Ambassador Gu's Address</h3>
<p>(Geneva) At today's meeting of the League of Nations China Technical Cooperation Committee, Chinese Ambassador to France Dr. Gu Weijun raised a dispute, saying that Dr. Rajchman's report was completely objective, and the current situation in China was accurately recorded in the book. China felt grateful for the assistance given by the League of Nations, and was very pleased that Dr. Rajchman恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪</p>
<h3>English Policy Shift in the Far East: Labour Leader Criticizes Government's Complacency Towards Japan; Conservatives Still Cling to Old Alliance; Foreign Minister Simon Explains Nine-Power Treaty, Saying There's a Clear Distinction Between Respect and Guarantee</h3>
<p>(London) During the House of Commons session today, Labour leader Clement Attlee spoke, criticizing Japan's policies in the Far East.</p>
<p>The Labour leader spoke critically of Japan, insisting that Japan has already embarked on an imperialistic path of expansion, with its sights set on China rather than Russia. Attlee further stated that Russia's substantial power has somewhat curbed the ambitions of Japanese militarists to delve into Siberia as far as Lake Baikal. They have shifted their focus to North China, where Japan's desire to establish a second "Manchukuo" is widely acknowledged. Will Britain continue to tacitly permit the division of its interests in China by Japan? It should be understood that once Japan annexes North China, it will prepare to gradually encroach upon South China and expel the European powers. Rumors suggest that Japan is using sweet words to entice Turkey into joining the German-Japanese alliance. If this occurs, a group opposing the League of Nations may emerge, backed by the strength of Japan and Germany. Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi and other key figures were present in the audience during Attlee's speech.</p>
<p>Conservative MPs frequently show favour to Japan. Conservative MP Keyes followed, asserting that the Singapore naval base should not be viewed as a threat to Japan, but rather as closely related to the defense of New Zealand and Australia. He consistently lamented the termination of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. He believes that a thorough and positive understanding with Japan would greatly benefit the interests of the Empire and the British in the Far East.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Simon, on Britain's intent to tear up the Nine-Power Treaty, delivered a speech in the House of Commons at 1:37 PM today, stating that while Japan's semi-official declaration has caused anxiety in many other countries, the British government is the one engaging in negotiations. Since Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota has offered a solemn guarantee to British Ambassador Lindley, how can he state to a friendly government, "I don't believe it"? No nation has undertaken the obligation to use its military force to uphold the territorial integrity and political independence of China. The Nine-Power Treaty only mentions respecting territorial integrity. There is a clear distinction between "respect" and "maintain." As for whether the League of Nations has mishandled the Far East issue, opinions vary and each has their own perspective.</p>
<p>Reform the League of Nations by First Seeking Disarmament. Simon then discussed reforming the League of Nations, stating that he and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini are both willing to reconsider the League of Nations Covenant. They believe that incorporating this issue into the already complex discussions on disarmament would likely hinder achieving a compromise. Any amendment to the Covenant should include German participation. Britain intends to exert every effort to facilitate the resolution of the disarmament issue.</p>
<p>Unwilling to Easily Implement Economic Sanctions. Britain is currently closely studying the issue of economic sanctions. However, such sanctions, if implemented recklessly, would inevitably lead to war. Sanctions should not only be applied to weak countries, but must also be applied to strong countries. Economic pressure is ineffective without force. We deeply appreciate the contributions that the United States has made to the improvement of international affairs, but it must be understood that the future actions of the United States are bound by its own scope. It is useless to speculate beyond this scope.</p>
<p>Simon then spoke about the situation in Geneva, refuting the general sentiment that "we have reached the end of a tragic and adventurous undertaking and should strike our tents." He said that if we achieve nothing, the harm to the world would be unimaginable. Simon then added that Great Britain has always been a leader, aiming to achieve disarmament. If the current attempt at disarmament unfortunately fails, it must be followed by new efforts. Simon's speech lasted for an hour, after which he responded to Attlee's inquiry, stating that Great Britain naturally supports the League of Nations' report on the Far East incident and will never depart from it without appropriate notification.

The proposed sanctions would not only lead to an Anglo-Japanese war, but would also trigger a Japanese-American war, so we should not threaten Japan. Admiral Keyes advocated compromise with Japan, stating that Japan inevitably occupies a significant role in Eastern affairs and is determined to move forward. Therefore, I advocate that the British government should understand Japan well. The discussion then turned to the Air Force disarmament agreement, during which Lord President Baldwin made a startling statement, stating that the agreement must stipulate sanctions against any nation that violates it. Such sanctions would inevitably lead to war, so if we wish to impose sanctions, we must prepare for war. Currently, Britain has already begun preliminary plans to expand its air force. Baldwin acknowledged the seriousness of the world situation, but remains confident that Britain will not face any immediate danger. Baldwin also stated that if we wish to implement collective security sanctions, Britain must be placed in a stronger position. This afternoon, Foreign Secretary Simon also stated in the House of Commons that the failure of the Disarmament Conference is inevitable, but this is not the end of the world. On the day of the disarmament collapse, we must immediately seek new avenues to dedicate ourselves to it. It would be foolish to consider disarmament a "Requiem," as Britain will continue to seek a resolution at future conferences (Simon's future conferences refer to the League of Nations Disarmament General Assembly on May 29). However, at the next conference, Britain will no longer put forward proposals, but will only clarify its previous suggestions and seek feedback from representatives of other nations on whether they have better ideas.

<h3>New Japanese Policy Towards China: Ariyoshi's Reappointment Will Bring Developments</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Today's editorial in the American-run Japan Advertiser stated that the reason why the Japanese Foreign Ministry issued a statement on April 17, prohibiting others from interfering in China, was that it knew the great powers were currently considering concrete methods to revive China. If Japan refuses to allow third countries to assist China under the auspices of the League of Nations, then it must provide China with that which it denies China from receiving from other nations. It seems the Japanese government is now prepared to do so. Soon, Japan's Minister to China, Ariyoshi Akira, may announce Japan's action plan. (Reuters Telegram, 18th)</p>
<h3>Question of Opium in Manchukuo: British Foreign Minister Simon Answers Member's Question</h3>
<p>(London) Today, British Foreign Minister Simon answered Labour MP Grenfell's question in the House of Commons, stating that the League of Nations Opium Committee has not issued a report on the establishment of a state opium monopoly in China's northeastern provinces under Japanese military occupation. The British government abides by the recommendations of the Opium Advisory Committee, rigorously examines applications to transport narcotics into Manchuria and Jehol, and adheres to the obligations under the Hague Peace Convention.

<h3>Japanese Overreaction: Sino-Russian Secret Agreement is Nonsense</h3>
<p>According to inquiries from all reliable sources by TASS, the report circulated by the Moscow Japanese League News Agency that Yan Huiqing, the Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, currently in Beiping, and the Soviet diplomatic representative in Beiping have concluded a secret agreement regarding Inner Mongolia, is clearly utter nonsense.

<h3>Litvinov Arrives in Geneva: New Developments to Occur in the Question of Russia's Admission to the League of Nations</h3>

It is said that what they will discuss is the issue of Soviet Russia's accession to the League of Nations, so it is expected here that important developments will occur soon. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov has arrived here today. Although his visit is related to the disarmament issue, it has once again drawn general attention to the possibility of Soviet Russia joining the League of Nations. Litvinov is scheduled to meet with French Foreign Minister Barthou this afternoon, followed by visits to the League of Nations Italian representative Aloisi and British representative Eden. Although significant difficulties remain to be resolved, it is believed that various issues can be resolved satisfactorily at the League of Nations General Assembly in September. Poland and Spain are now advocating that if a permanent council seat is given to Soviet Russia, then this seat should also be granted to both countries. Poland also demands that treaty-based minority rights should be made universal. It is heard that Soviet Russia prefers to be widely invited to join the League of Nations to avoid applying itself and facing opposition, which would be embarrassing. (Reuters Telegram, 18th)</p>

<h3>Truth Behind the Shooting of a Finance Ministry Employee Still Under Investigation</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the case of Finance Ministry employee Huo Ziduan being shot by a railway police officer, Huo is in good condition after being hospitalized and having the bullet removed. According to Deng Liangsheng, secretary of the Railway Police Bureau, Director Sun Lida of the railway police unit reported the incident to the bureau on the 17th, stating that immediately after the incident, the station military police checked the railway police's bullets and found none missing. An examination of the gun muzzle also showed no signs of firing. Therefore, it is believed that the bullet did not come from the railway police, leaving its origin a mystery. The situation has been reported to the Shanghai Police Department by telegram. If the bullet was fired by the railway police, the railway police will bear responsibility. The bullet is currently at the hospital, and its origin can be proven once the bullet is jointly examined. However, the bureau has not received an official report, so it is difficult to predict how to handle the matter. Liang Chenkai, the deputy director of the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Police Department, arrived in Beijing on the 18th to investigate the truth of the case. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Roosevelt Orders Investigation</p>
<h3>Japanese Goods Invading American Markets; Investigation into Imports of Japanese Porcelain and Pottery; There is a Growing Trend to Emulate British Boycott of Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>(Washington) Due to the fierce competition of Japanese goods in the American market, there are numerous criticisms from all sides. President Roosevelt specifically ordered the Tariff Commission today to investigate whether the current imports of porcelain and pottery are harming domestic products. Roosevelt is extremely concerned about domestic products because domestic production costs have increased in accordance with the National Recovery Administration industry regulations. According to responsible sources, if the Tariff Commission finds that these imports are harming American products, President Roosevelt will use his unlimited powers under the Recovery Act to immediately restrict imports. (17th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(New York) There is a growing trend in the United States to emulate Britain's restrictions on textile imports. If this happens, Japan will be severely hit. The American Cotton Textile Industry Regulations authorities submitted a request to the Tariff Commission today to immediately investigate the extent to which foreign goods are invading the domestic market, advocating for the adoption of full measures to prevent the invasion of foreign goods. There has been a constant outcry that countries with low living standards are exporting large quantities of cotton and other textiles to the United States, causing significant losses to domestic industries. Therefore, the industry regulations authorities have specifically drawn the Tariff Commission's attention to this issue. At the same time, Japan has taken the first official step in London, requesting the British government to revise its policy of limiting Japanese goods entering Britain. Japanese Ambassador Matsudaira sent a diplomatic note to British Trade Minister Runciman, stating the Japanese government's views on the new quota and raising the question of whether the new British quota violates the most-favored-nation treatment clause in the Anglo-Japanese commercial treaty. This note requested the British government to reconsider the quota, but did not mention how Japan would respond. The British Trade Minister agreed to consider the note. (17th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(New York) According to reliable sources here today, the US government has commissioned an investigation into the DuPont Armaments Factory's sale of a large number of ammonia nitrate machinery to Japan. It is reported that US government officials had informally questioned the DuPont factory about the sale of the latest ammonia nitrate manufacturing machinery to Mitsui &amp; Co. of Japan, based on the fact that certain items licensed by the United States are not allowed to be exported. Factory officials stated in response that there was nothing shady about the sale of this machinery, because such machinery could also be purchased from other countries. They also stated that if the factory had refused the sale, Mitsui &amp; Co. could have purchased it from Germany. Currently, this machinery is purely for agricultural purposes and cannot be forcibly labeled as military use. After discussion by the Washington administrative authorities, the factory was notified that the authorities would no longer object and that the factory could continue to sell to Japan. However, newspapers have widely reported on the matter, claiming that this machinery could be converted for military use. Therefore, the factory's Washington office issued a statement purely from an agricultural and commercial standpoint, stating that Japan has limited farmland and that its farmers urgently need this machinery to increase production, as Japan needs to produce its own fertilizers.

<h3>Matsudaira Lodges Protest Against British Exclusion of Japanese Goods; British Trade Minister Will Soon Issue a Reply; No Revision Expected for Boycott Measures</h3>
<p>(London) Since last Monday, after Trade Minister Runciman announced in the House of Commons that the colonies would adopt measures to restrict the quantity of imported cotton textiles and rayon from foreign countries, the Japanese government has regarded this move as a violation of the most-favored-nation clause.</p>
<p>This afternoon, Japanese Ambassador to the UK Matsudaira visited Trade Minister Runciman at the Ministry of Trade and had a lengthy conversation. Matsudaira informed Runciman of the Japanese government's opinion, stating that Anglo-Japanese commercial relations have always been based on most-favored-nation treatment, and that the recent restrictions imposed by British colonies on the import of Japanese goods are contrary to the most-favored-nation clause. Runciman took note of the Japanese Ambassador's opinion. However, it is said that Runciman replied to Matsudaira that, in his view, the most-favored-nation clause should not be interpreted in this way, and that the measures taken by the UK apply equally to all countries and do not violate commercial treaties. It is likely that the British government will not consider the Japanese request to be valid, and that the British government's recent measures, except for some minor details, will not be revised in any way. Runciman will soon send the British reply to Matsudaira. (17th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Silk Problems Advisory Committee, commissioned to study the revision of tariffs on imported foreign silk fabrics, has recently submitted its report.

The Japanese delegation is scheduled to leave Kobe tomorrow, taking the route through Singapore to Batavia. (18th [Illegible] Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Will Submit Five Messages to Congress; Silver Bill Will Prompt International Conference</h3>
<p>(Washington) The White House announced today that President Roosevelt will submit five special messages to Congress within a week. Congressional leaders are currently clearing everything in preparation for formally rejecting or approving various bills. The President's five messages are as follows:</p>

<p>(2) Silver - This message will be submitted on Sunday. The President and silver faction leaders have reached a compromise agreement. President Roosevelt has agreed to propose in his special message a mandatory and permissible bill that he is willing to accept.</p>
<p>(3) Arms - President Roosevelt will request Congress to appoint a special committee to investigate the activities of arms companies during the congressional recess and to propose opinions on the management of arms. The President will also request the power to order a ban on the shipment of arms to Bolivia and Paraguay, in order to stop the Chaco War.</p>
<p>(4) Coconut Oil Tax - President Roosevelt opposes incorporating the 3% coconut oil tax into the tax amendment recently passed by Congress. However, the President will be forced to sign the bill because he does not want to veto the entire bill because of this one point.</p>
<p>(5) Social Issues - This message will address in detail the various social problems arising from the depression, such as slum clearance, housing, federal government prevention of criminal behavior, poverty relief, pensions, worker compensation, and unemployment insurance.

<h3>Results of US Naval Simulation; Proves Fleet Has Strength to Defend Canal; Enemy Will Pay a Heavy Price to Occupy or Destroy It</h3>
<p>Balboa Heights, Panama Canal Zone According to Senior Military Officials, the Lessons Learned by the Naval Authorities in this Tactical Exercise Are Very Valuable. This Exercise Began on April 9 When the US Fleet Departed from San Pedro and Ended When It Arrived in Balboa Heights. An Associated Press Reporter Learned Today of the Three Significant Results of This Exercise:</p>
<p>(1) The Panama Canal Can Theoretically Be Occupied or Destroyed by an Enemy Fleet, but the Price Would Be Too High for Even the Strongest Country to Bear, so Actual Occupation is Impossible. (2) Under the Current Situation, a Japanese-American Naval War Is Completely Impossible. Although Enemy Forces Can Land on the Mainland with a Large Naval Force, Any Attempt to Seize the Canal with a Smaller Fleet is Tantamount to Suicide. (3) Due to the Above Facts, Battleships Have Become the Main Force in Defending the Panama Canal.</p>
<p>This exercise aimed to defend the Panama Canal and the eastern United States when the US Fleet Was Caught Off Guard at the Outbreak of War. It Also Assumed That Enemy Forces Could Occupy a Forward Base in the West Indies and Concentrate a Strong Fleet in the Caribbean Sea. The Exercise Strove to Simulate Actual War Conditions. Navy Secretary Swanson Today Congratulated US Fleet Commander-in-Chief Sellers via Radio for the Success. Acting Chief of Naval Operations Du Shimei Also Praised It, Saying That Considering the Age of Most of the Ships, the Results of This Exercise Were Indeed Rare and Valuable Because Most of the Battleships Have Reached Their Ship Age, and so on.

(17th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to a News Report in Jiji Shinpo Today, the Chairman of the Two-Person Committee of the League of Nations Preparing for the Saar Region Plebiscite, Aloisi, Has Requested Both German and French Members to Make Concessions to Each Other. It Is Said That Aloisi's View Is That Germany Should Give a Solemn Guarantee That All People in the Saar Region Should Have Absolute Individual Freedom of Voting, and That No Retaliatory Measures Should Be Taken Against People Who Vote Against Restoring German National Sovereignty. Furthermore, Guarantees Should Also Be Given to the Saar Minority. If Germany Can Acknowledge the Above Points, Then France and the League of Nations Should Immediately Abandon Their Proposal to Organize an International Police Force. (17th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Saar Governing Council Publishes Response to German Document: Improper Administrative Actions Criticized by Germany as Deviating from the Spirit of Governance</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Today, the Secretariat of the League of Nations re-released a letter from the Saar Governing Council to the League of Nations. This letter is the Council's response to the speech given by German Propaganda Minister Goebbels in Ziegenbrück recently. Goebbels' speech contained many criticisms of the Council's administrative actions. One of the strongest points of Germany's criticism of the Council is that many German exiles and political prisoners who have fled to the Saar region are working in the Saar press, engaged in anti-German activities and the propagation of Marxism, and that the Governing Council has even hired some of them. This is contrary to the spirit of the League of Nations' administration of the region. Furthermore, some of the political prisoners have committed ordinary criminal offenses, and the Saar government has recklessly accepted them, which is also inconsistent with the Council's mission. This matter was formally protested by German Foreign Minister Neurath to the Governing Council on February 27. The Council's response is that it has investigated all persons entering the region who are suspected of criminal activity. However, officials of the Council who were forced to leave their positions after Germany implemented the new civil service law cannot all be regarded as exiles. It is expected that Germany will regard this response as a refusal to consider Germany's protest. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Cooperates with League of Nations to Prevent Chaco War: President to Ask Congress to Legislate Arms Embargo</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, Under Secretary of State Phillips stated that President Roosevelt may ask Congress to immediately pass an arms embargo, as Geneva has been discussing a worldwide ban on arms shipments to Bolivia and Paraguay. Phillips declared that the United States is prepared to cooperate with the League of Nations to prevent the Chaco War, but President Roosevelt can only issue the embargo after Congress grants this authority. Both the Senate and House of Representatives have passed a joint resolution authorizing the President to prohibit arms exports. The resolution has been amended by the Senate and is awaiting House approval. The President's actions are based on the proposal of the League of Nations Council, as League representatives have stated that the feasibility of banning arms to Bolivia and Paraguay depends on whether the United States is willing to join the embargo agreement. The U.S. congressional joint resolution has been delayed due to the Senate amendment, which stipulates that the arms export ban should be implemented simultaneously against both belligerent countries. Therefore, this amendment may hinder the United States or the international community from imposing sanctions on aggressor countries. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>

<h3>Embassy Upgrading Issue: Japan Has Not Yet Formally Proposed It</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Reports say that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs hopes to actively realize the upgrading of the Chinese and Japanese embassies to embassies. According to diplomatic sources, Japan does have intentions regarding the upgrading of the Chinese and Japanese embassies. Observing its intentions, there are indeed two levels of significance. First, it will use this to show respect for China's status in order to ease anti-Japanese sentiment. Second, it will use this to show that the problems between China and Japan have become closer, in order to shake the friendly beliefs of various countries towards China. Judging from Japan's various propaganda efforts in recent days, it is quite credible. But in fact, Japanese officials have not yet made a request, and our government has not yet considered it. The news reported may be a kind of propaganda effect from the Japanese side, in order to spy on the attitudes of all parties. (Special Telegram, 18th)</p>

<h3>Conference of Chinese and Japanese Representatives at Shanhaiguan: Yin Tong About to Go to Beijing and Shanghai to Consult on Policy</h3>
<p>Beijing Correspondence: The Sino-Japanese problem has been unresolved for a long time. The Japanese have used various methods of intimidation and enticement to achieve their ultimate goals. Our side is under accumulated pressure and finds it difficult to cope. Last month, Huang Fu went south to discuss matters, and Sino-Japanese diplomacy has gradually developed over the past month. For example, various issues in the war zone are seeking appropriate solutions. On the 14th of this month, Chinese and Japanese representatives gathered at Yuguan for another meeting. The Chinese representatives were Yin Rugeng and Tao Shangming, Yin Tong, and the Japanese representatives were Matsui, Director of the Chengde Special Service Agency; Ii, Director of the Yuyu Special Service Agency; Shibayama, Military Attaché of the Japanese Embassy; and Ota Hisakazu, Director of the Puppet Fengshan Railway Bureau. The two sides discussed ways to resolve various issues in the war zone. Ota has already returned east after the meeting, and Yin Tong has also returned to Tianjin. He will go to Beijing and Shanghai within days to consult with the central government and Huang Fu. Tai Yuan, who is in Peiping, will go to Tianjin in the next day or two to have further contact with Yin Tong. As for the various issues in the war zone, the solutions have been discussed and agreed upon at the Yuguan meeting and are now being implemented separately. Yin Rugeng and Shibayama also returned to Peiping yesterday (16th) and immediately contacted the relevant parties. This morning (17th), Yin visited Shibayama again at the Japanese Embassy to discuss the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Jixian County. Shibayama has sent personnel to Jixian this afternoon (17th) to investigate the truth and work together to resolve the issue. Yin has also sent Qu Shihe to handle the matter as appropriate. According to Yin, "The issue of the Japanese troops' intrusion into Jixian County has been resolved very satisfactorily through negotiations with the Japanese side, and it will not be expanded. The Japanese troops who invaded Jixian County are 200 men from the regiment led by Hayashida. A part of them had already withdrawn to Ma Lan Yu the day before yesterday. The rest were originally scheduled to withdraw yesterday, but due to the instigation of traitors, it was said that the militia in the first district of Jixian County were carrying heavy weapons, which caused a misunderstanding by the Japanese troops and delayed the withdrawal. Our side is now negotiating with the Japanese side on whether the militia are carrying heavy weapons. This still needs to be investigated. Even if it is true, we only need to confiscate them ourselves, without the need for external intervention, to avoid causing other disputes. The Japanese side also understands this quite well and has sent Qu Shihe to handle it today, and it should be resolved within a few days. The issue of receiving Ma Lan Yu still involves other matters, which can be carried out when Chairman Huang returns to Peiping. The issue of the puppet police at Gubeikou Nantianmen has been largely resolved and can be withdrawn within days." According to Shibayama, "The Sino-Japanese representatives discussed at the Yuguan meeting only the issues of security administration in the war zone and the continued reception of the remaining ports. The security team in the war zone was a temporary measure, temporarily reorganized from the army. Now the newly formed security team has completed training and can be replaced within a month. At the Yuguan meeting, it was decided that the total number of the security team would be 8,000. Except for the units of Dou Xizhe, Zhou Yuying, and Wei Yonghe, which were transferred out, the unit of Li Jichun was reorganized into the units of Zhao Zhilei and Liu Zuozhou, which will remain in the war zone. The new security team is not allowed to carry heavy weapons. During the change of guard, the Japanese side will send Ii to monitor. The Jixian incident will not be expanded. I will send personnel to investigate to facilitate an early resolution. The puppet police stationed at Gubeikou Nantianmen have decided to withdraw 20 li and will be withdrawn within a week. The reception of Ma Lan Yu is only a matter of time. The Japanese side has decided to return it to China and is ready to carry out the handover as soon as possible. It is expected that all issues in the war zone will be completely resolved within a month. The issue of traffic was not mentioned at the Yuguan meeting. Whether it was mentioned at the Beidaihe meeting is unknown because I did not participate. (17th)</p>

<h3>Remnants of the Ye Bandit Disturbed Junmen and Retreated in Defeat; Xiao Bandit of Yudu Attacked Ganxian Unsuccessfully</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since retreating to Huichang, the communist bandits have changed their strategy and plan to extend to eastern and western Jiangxi. In eastern Jiangxi, one force is confronting the bandit suppression army in eastern Fujian Province. In addition to using Xiao Ke's force to contain the Hunan Army in western Jiangxi, they recently planned to use a main force to break out of Ganzhou from Yudu, Xingguo, and other places to open up the road to western Jiangxi. Therefore, there have been communist bandit activities near Ganxian in recent days. The Second and Fourth Divisions of the First Column have recently discovered the presence of communist bandits in the Benmao Dian area. At dawn on the 7th, about 700 members of the pseudo-Red Guard, with 400 guns, fled from Yudu to Xiaoben, which belongs to Ganxian County. Song Shitai's regiment, stationed in Hanfang by the Second Division of the defense army, rushed to suppress them. At 1:00 PM that afternoon, Song's regiment fought the bandits fiercely for two hours. The bandits were defeated and retreated towards Mailing. More than 100 communist bandits were wounded and killed, and one artillery piece, two machine guns, and two red flags were captured. The next day, other communist bandit teams were discovered in Maodian. The Fourth Division of the defense army, upon receiving the report, sent the teaching regiment of the division, led by Zeng Zhaoji, to suppress them. On the evening of the 8th, they crossed the river from Hualinsi, and on the 9th, they approached Maodian and besieged the communist pseudo-independent battalion in Wanshou Palace Shangxia Gate Market. At the same time, the 11th regiment, led by Li Guoliang, was sent from the east bank of the Gan River to Maodian to respond. Zeng's regiment received reinforcements and soon entered Maodian, and burned the bandit stronghold on Yunzishan. The remaining bandits fled towards Huanglongpu. (13th)</p>

<h3>Eastern Route Army Captures Jianning; Connection Line Between Communist Bandits in Eastern Jiangxi and Northern Fujian Severed; Bandit Suppression Military Affairs Turn to Western Fujian and Southern Jiangxi</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Jianning is located between western Fujian and northern Fujian, bordering Tai Ning, Jiangle, Shaxian, and Minlian to the northeast, Guihua, Qingliu, and Ninghua to the southeast, and Lichuan, Nanfeng, Guangchang, and Shicheng to the west, which are on the southeastern border of eastern Jiangxi. In the past, it was the connecting land between the communist bandits in eastern Jiangxi and northern Fujian and those in western Fujian and southern Jiangxi. Since the Northern Route Army captured Guangchang, Jianning has been parallel with Guangchang. In the eyes of the communist bandits, if they did not firmly defend Jianning, they would not be able to protect Qingning and Lianting. In the eyes of the National Army, if they did not recover Jianning, they would not be able to protect Guangchang and the connection between Fujian and Jiangxi. Therefore, the National Army deployed a general offensive towards Jianning at the beginning of the month, using the 囗囗 and other divisions as the main force, and the 囗囗 and other divisions to move east from Gaozhou to provide support. Zhu Mao gathered a part of the pseudo-First, Second, Fifth, Seventh, Ninth, and Twelfth Army Corps and built fortifications around Jianning, especially the surrounding bunkers, moats, and earthen walls, which were meticulously and firmly arranged. On the 10th of this month, when the 囗 division, the main force of the National Army, advanced from Jiangjiadian, the pseudo-Fifth and Seventh Army Corps of the bandits suddenly pounced on the division's position at one point. The 囗 division fought bravely with the bandits, and by the morning of the 11th, they finally defeated the bandits. At the same time, the air force flew in formations to Jianning and bombed the bandits' densely packed teams and fortifications. The bandits in Lushan, numbering two to three thousand, were also heavily damaged under the joint land and air operations of the National Army. The bandits resisted step by step, relying on dangerous terrain, and the National Army inflicted heavy blows on them step by step. In particular, the 囗囗 division was the most courageous, attacking the bandits of the pseudo-First Regiment, Second Division, pseudo-Third Army Corps Fifth Division, and pseudo-Seventh Army Corps Nineteenth Division, who were entrenched on Shuangxi Mountain and Wuzhen Ridge on the 13th. The bandits occupied high ground and built fortifications in advance, stubbornly resisting. They fought hand-to-hand, and the corpses of bandits filled the front of the battle. The bandit forces could not hold on and retreated towards the vicinity of Jianning City. Since then, the National Army has surrounded Jianning City. At that time, the communist bandits in Fujian concentrated their forces to defend the bunkers around Mazhai Shuangfeng and Jianning City, desperately defending to the death. The National Army continued to advance forcefully, and large bombers continued to bomb, causing heavy casualties among the bandits, and the fortresses were completely destroyed. By 10:00 AM on the 16th, the National Army recovered Jianning City. At that time, Tang Enbo sent a part of his team to guard the city, clear the battlefield, handle local rehabilitation, and send teams to pursue the bandits who retreated south. Now that Jianning has fallen, the connection between the communist bandits in eastern Jiangxi and northern Fujian has been completely severed, and the northeast roads of Guangchang and Jianning have achieved practical contact, penetrating deep into the heart of the bandits. The military affairs of bandit suppression are completely shifting towards southern Jiangxi and western Fujian, and can be carried out directly from Ninghua and Shicheng to Dingzhou and Ruijin.

<h3>Shandong Provincial Government Bans Unconventional Dress for Female Civil Servants; Some Refuse to Obey the Law; Let's See What Happens After Reissuing the Previous Order</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Provincial Government previously issued an order to all agencies regarding the clothing of female civil servants, requiring them to comply with the regulations stipulated by the Ministry of Interior. It has been a long time since then, and many have not complied, and have even gone to extremes, competing for novelty. This is a special reissuance of the previous order, the original text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>"Upon investigation, the uniforms for female civil servants were previously approved by the Ministry of Interior's Police Order No. 32, which stipulates the uniform regulations as follows: (1) The garment shall have a collar, a right-covering front, and a length from the knee to the midpoint of the ankle, level with the bottom of the trousers. The sleeves shall be longer than the elbow and reach the midpoint of the wrist. The material shall be silk, linen, cotton, or wool fabrics, but the color is not restricted. (2) The shoes shall be made of silk, cotton, wool fabrics, or leather, and shall be black in color. These regulations have been published in the Provincial Government Gazette and communicated to all for compliance. It has been a long time since then, and many have not complied, and have even gone to extremes, vying for strangeness, which is really inappropriate. It has now been stipulated by this government that all uniforms for female civil servants shall comply with the regulations issued by the Ministry, but the color of the uniforms should be the same as those for male civil servants: black in winter and white in summer. The materials should also be limited to domestic products to maintain decorum and regulate discipline. In addition to distribution, this order is hereby issued to the director to instruct compliance. This order."</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Sanmen Bay Defense Corps: A Record of the First General Meeting</h3>
<p>The Sanmen Bay Volunteer Defense Corps has been officially established, and the first general meeting was held at 3:00 PM on April 23rd. Those in attendance included Xu Tingzu of the Sanmen Bay Port Development Company, (represented by Wang Zhongcui), Lin Peizhi, a representative from the Patrol Inspectorate Township, Lin Weiqing, Ding Shunan, an assistant from the Ninghai Third District Office, Ding Desan, Zhou Shenghao, Ding Rongqing, Chen Jiqing, Zhang Hongtao, Yang Fuquan, Lin Zexu, Xu Xiangkui, Qiu Baoyuan, and Zhang Min, totaling twenty-six people. Xu Tingzu presided over the meeting, and Lin Peizhi served as the recorder. First, the chairman delivered a report, stating that since Sanmen Bay was ordered to be developed as a port, it has been more than five years, and the initial construction has taken shape. Shops in the Patrol Inspectorate have also been successively opened. Regarding the security of the port, the provincial government has repeatedly assigned security teams to be stationed for maintenance. Last winter, due to the withdrawal of the garrison troops to suppress bandits, the security of the port was worrying. In order to maintain the security of the port, twenty-four Hubei-made 79 rifles and two thousand four hundred rounds of ammunition were purchased from the provincial government. In accordance with the Defense Corps Law promulgated by the Security Office of the Provincial Government, the Sanmen Bay Volunteer Defense Corps was organized for protection. The cost of these guns and ammunition was entirely borne by Tingzu personally. Wang Zhongcui is now assigned to transport them to the port. The organizational methods, expenses, and services of the corps should be discussed and decided upon in order to be submitted to the Ninghai County Government and then to the Provincial Government for record. The plan includes: (1) Organizational method: To be handled in accordance with the Defense Corps Law, with one head, one chief squad leader, one deputy squad leader, and twenty-two members. (2) Establishment date: April 23rd, 1934. After the organization is established, it will be submitted to the Ninghai County Government and then to the Provincial Government for record. (3) Expenses: Lin Peizhi, the head of the Patrol Inspectorate Township, proposed that since Xu Tingzu has already borne the cost of the guns and ammunition and transported them to the port, the expenses for the squad leaders and members should be borne by the local merchants and the local area. Each should be responsible for their duties. However, in the early stages of the market, all matters should be based on the premise of fulfilling obligations. It is now proposed to hire four people to be responsible for teaching and training. Their monthly salary will be based on the method used by the stores in the port last year to hire guards, with the distribution depending on the business volume of each store. Is this appropriate? Please decide. Resolution: Unanimously approved without objection. (4) Services: Ding Shunan, an assistant from the Ninghai County Third District Office, proposed that in addition to the two hired chief and deputy squad leaders and two members, there are still twenty volunteer members in the port. Strong men will be dispatched from each store and local area to serve. Renhe Company will dispatch eight, Ding Yili one, Yuxinglong Company one, Samsungtang one, Sanmen Bay Hotel one, Xidong Village four, and Xiaopu Village four. Resolution passed. (5)</p>
<p>Training: Training will be held from 5:00 AM to 6:00 AM every day, led by the squad leader, and field exercises will be convened from time to time to develop the habit of concentrating for defense in case of emergency, in order to facilitate defense. (6) Defense: Each service member should find a guarantor to issue a guarantee, and receive guns and ammunition from the Sanmen Bay Port Development Company for guard duty at any time. A roster of the members should be submitted to the county government for record, in order to show prudence.</p>
<p>All members should stand guard and patrol at night. In case of emergency, they should be summoned immediately to help each other for defense.</p>
<h3>Jiang Song Pirates Rob Fishing Boats</h3>
<p>Lu Liangshan, a fisherman from Caoging in Punan, returned from fishing at sea. His boat was docked at Beitang Beach when a pirate ship suddenly arrived the night before. Several armed robbers with handguns boarded the boat and robbed it. Lu Liangshan managed to escape. The pirates sailed away with Lu's fishing boat. The abandoned pirate ship was identified as a patrol boat driven by Wang Heshang, a tax police officer. A military cap and a box of handgun bullets were found on the ship. The case was immediately reported to the Provincial Security Team stationed in the town. Since the ship was a police boat, Wang Heshang was suspected. According to Wang Heshang's confession, the ship was no longer in use, and he is currently a soldier in the 55th team. When shown the military cap, he had no answer. He was then detained for investigation. The case was reported by Zhang Baoyuan, the chief of the fifteenth district, to the county, who ordered the Public Security Bureau to arrest the suspects. It is said that the fishing boat contained over two hundred silver dollars and other valuables, all of which were robbed.</p>
<h3>No News of Jiading's Zhu Yinjiang</h3>
<p>It has been several months since Zhu Yinjiang, a wealthy merchant from this county residing in Shanghai, was kidnapped on the Pu'an steamer. All the other kidnapped individuals have been rescued and returned to Shanghai. Although Zhu's family has remitted a large sum of money for rescue, he has not yet returned to Shanghai. Moreover, there has been no news from the bandits since February. His son went to Shantou to inquire, but there was no trace. His family and friends are very worried.</p>
<h3>Arresting Gamblers and Resisting Arrest Nearly Caused a Major Disaster</h3>
<p>Wang Xingyuan, the acting director of the Nanchang Public Security First Branch, received a report that Gu A'di from Fengjia Beach, Haiwu Tu, Qingning Township, was hiring people to sing obscene flower drum lyrics and running a gambling den, skimming profits. On the night of the 15th, he sent ten policemen to make arrests. They apprehended more than ten people, including Township Head Min Ru, Min Xinru, Gu Wenfu, Min Zhongsan, Lu Jinsheng, Gu Aluan, and Gu Shoumei. As they were being taken away, Gu Borong, a local hooligan, beat a gong to gather a crowd and resist the arrest. The neighboring villages responded to the sound. The local defense corps, without investigating the situation, mistakenly believed it was a police raid and fired over ten shots as a warning. The police were all unarmed and afraid of causing a major disaster, so they abandoned the captured gamblers and returned to the station. On the morning of the 16th, Acting Director Wang sent Patrol Chief Jiang to continue the arrest, apprehending A'di's wife, Yao, Gu Heshang, who ran a teahouse, and Gu Rongxiang, a suspect in resisting arrest. After bringing them to the station, they were sent to the county bureau. Public Security Bureau Chief Xue Bingyang questioned them and confirmed the previous situation. Considering the incident involved gathering a crowd to resist arrest, and the local defense corps opened fire rashly, raising suspicion of deliberately aiding the evildoers, a written report was transferred to the county government for investigation.</p>
<h3>A Large Number of Prisoners Transferred to Taibao</h3>
<p>The county prison was not spacious to begin with. Due to the successive transfers of prisoners from other places, the number of prisoners had accumulated to more than 360, causing severe overcrowding. Diseases were rampant among the prisoners, and deaths occurred frequently. The local public groups had previously petitioned the High Court to have all the transferred prisoners taken back. Now, the county government continued to petition and received instructions to transfer fifty convicted prisoners to Baoshan and ten to Taicang. On the morning of the 18th, they were escorted by the county police team outside the East Gate, loaded onto automobiles, and sent to Taibao.</p>
<h3>Electric Company Extends Power Supply Time</h3>
<p>Since the 15th, the business community in this city has been holding a lantern festival as part of the New Life Movement, which is quite lively. The parade was not over by 12:00 AM, and many businesses could not close. However, the electricity was cut off at 12:00 AM as usual, causing great inconvenience to the business community. This caused resentment, and over sixty merchants jointly submitted a letter requesting the Huaxing Electric Company to install electric meters and provide power day and night, with electricity fees calculated based on usage. If there was no satisfactory response by the 20th, they would all stop using electricity. At the same time, they were preparing to organize a United Electricity Users Association, with Zhu Shilin and thirteen others as organizers. The county party headquarters issued a permit, and a meeting was scheduled to be held at the Tin Foil Guild Hall on the morning of the 19th. The atmosphere was quite tense. Starting on the 16th, the electric company extended the power supply time to 3:00 AM, but the remaining requests have not yet been answered.</p>
<h3>Suzhou's Decision on Zonal Division Dispute</h3>
<p>After Wuxian County decided to change the urban and rural autonomous regions into twelve districts, there were many disputes among the districts regarding the zonal division. The county government convened a meeting of all district heads yesterday, and it was resolved to follow the provincial order, with each township limited to a maximum of 1,000 households. The divisions will be merged effectively, and the report must be submitted to the county by the end of May. The boundaries of each district and township will be marked by natural boundaries or other buildings, and the mergers will be based on practical convenience in order to expedite the decision.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Cracks Down on Secret Drug Pill Manufacturing Operation</h3>
<p>Wang Ji, the inspector-general of the County Public Security Bureau, received a tip that there was a tightly organized mobile drug pill manufacturing operation near Gaoqiao, in Meiji. He immediately set off with police officers and personally went to investigate. He discovered that the operation was set up on a river dredging boat. He then invited the township head of the township, Li Yangzhong, to board the boat and conduct a search. They arrested Zhu Baoshan on the spot and seized lactose powder, caffeine, saccharin, and other materials for manufacturing drug pills, as well as various tools. They then brought the boat and the suspect back to the city. After being interrogated by Director Chen, Bureau Doctor Lu Zongxiang identified and verified the seized items. Zhu Baoshan confessed that there was another boat with pill-making machines, containing a large number of manufactured drug pills, which had been moved away after the operation was tipped off. The drug pills were sold not only in this county but also in Yixing, Liyang, Changshu, and other counties, with a wide sales network. The owner was named Jiang A'er, and it was a company, according to his confession. The Public Security Bureau, based on the confession, has sent all the evidence and witnesses to the county government for transfer to the Zhenjiang Garrison Headquarters for handling.</p>
<h3>Organization of a Joint Silk Factory Business Office</h3>
<p>Zheng Bingquan, the manager of the Ruichang Silk Factory in this county, noting the failure of China's silk industry in recent years, aims to revive it by first uniting the industry and working together to promote production and sales cooperation. Under the two major principles of government promoting sericulture and supporting farmers and businesses, he proposes to work together to achieve success. Therefore, he has initiated the organization of a Joint Silk Factory Business Office and drafted an organizational outline. The preliminary content is to unite silk factory colleagues and implement production and sales cooperation, establishing Joint Silk Factory Business Offices in Shanghai, Wuxi, Hangzhou, Huzhou, and Suzhou. Its business includes acting as an agent for the procurement of goods, sales, mortgages, transportation warehouses, insurance, exchange, and investigation of business aspects for united factories, and the purchase of raw materials and materials, unified manufacturing, and management reforms for production aspects. All silk factory colleagues are welcome to join, combining all the cocoon companies, cocoon houses, and silk export businesses into one place. Its organization is a cooperative nature, with industry unity, self-regulation, centralized management, stable business, direct transactions, elimination of competition, convenience of affairs, cost savings, reduction of costs, and promotion of sales as its aims. The Shanghai Joint Business Office is located at the same address as the Commodity Inspection Bureau for convenient inspection of exports and transportation, and renting a warehouse for mortgage business. All buying and selling of goods from the united factories will be transacted in the business office. Daily investigation of market conditions and communication reports will be sent to each factory to facilitate communication and entrustment of sales. The Wuxi, Hangzhou, Huzhou, and Suzhou Joint Business Offices are located in local silk cocoon trade associations, specializing in direct sales to silk weaving factories, and jointly purchasing raw materials and materials, unified manufacturing, and management reforms to ensure the uniformity of export products and other cooperative affairs. It is also proposed to apply to the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Chinese embassies or consulates in the United States, France, the United Kingdom, and India to establish Chinese Silk Joint Business Offices attached to them for direct sales to silk weaving factories, seeking the development of Chinese silk in foreign markets and implementing official supervision and commercial management, in order to enrich the country and the people and restore the glory of China's ancient sericulture kingdom. The above plan has been sent by Mr. Zheng to the Sericulture Model Zone Design Committee in this county and submitted to the Sericulture Improvement and Management Committee for handling.</p>
<h3>Plague Discovered in Zhouxin Town</h3>
<p>In the Beipanpo Bridge area of Zhouxin Town, in the third district of the county, Zhou, the 45-year-old wife of Pan Guiquan, a villager, suddenly felt numbness in her limbs, chills all over her body, cramps, a stuffy chest, and a pale complexion while sitting in her room the other day at noon. She immediately collapsed to the ground. Pan Guiquan was shocked and immediately called a doctor to diagnose and treat her. The doctor said that it was a plague, and she was deeply poisoned and difficult to save. She died of exhaustion at about 9:00 PM. At the same time, Pan Jigen, the 19-year-old son of Pan A'gen, a neighbor, also died of the same disease. The villagers in the area were terrified and reported to the district office, which called Western doctor Ma Xieren to administer preventive injections to avoid the spread of the disease.</p>
<h3>Gu Li Bigamy Case Investigated Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Wuxi County Court Prosecutor's Office deemed the evidence insufficient in the case where Gu Renfa, the former Director of the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department, accused his wife, Li Shuyun, of selling official positions and extorting money, and allowed Li Shuyun and her daughter to be released on bail to Shanghai. Later, Li Shuyun, finding Gu Renfa to be insincere in reconciliation, decided to entrust lawyers Zhang Shizhao and Chao Kun to draft a complaint and file a lawsuit, (1) counter-suing Gu Renfa for false accusation, (2) accusing Gu Renfa of bigamy. The complaint was submitted to the Wuxi Local Branch Court, and the Prosecutor's Office approved the complaint and began the investigation yesterday. Those summoned were Li Shuyun, her daughter, and Gu Renfa. Gu's summons was requested by the Jiangning District Court, but Gu's whereabouts seemed to be unknown, so he has not yet appeared. Li Shuyun and her daughter arrived in Wuxi from Shanghai yesterday morning and first went to the home of Zhang Baocheng, a friend of her uncle Wen, at Zhongshi Bridge. Then, accompanied by Yu Tianxi, the director of Chao Kun's law firm, they reported to the court. Chief Qian opened the court for investigation for an hour. Regarding the bigamy part, because the defendant Gu Renfa's address was not in Wuxi, according to the jurisdiction issue, the complaint should be filed with the Jiangning District Court. Li Shuyun stated that the case arose from Gu Renfa's false accusation, so it must be filed in Wuxi. Also, because Gu had repeatedly failed to appear, she requested that he be arrested. Chief Qian agreed to sign an arrest warrant and then adjourned the court.</p>
<h3>Changshu Provincial Agricultural Bank Sends Personnel to Inspect Cotton Area</h3>
<p>The Provincial Farmers Bank, considering that Nantong, Jiangyin, and this county in Jiangsu Province are cotton-producing areas, intends to establish a cotton production and sales center in Changyinsha, the central location of the three counties, in order to facilitate production and sales cooperation and eliminate the pressure of small vendors buying at low prices. The method has been largely decided. Now, the bank has sent cooperation instructor Feng Zanyuan to Jiading, Taicang, Baoshan, Nantong, Shanghai, Jiangyin, and Changshu to inspect the cotton area, hoping to promote the establishment of the center. On the 17th of this month, Feng arrived in Changshu from Taicang. According to him, the cotton production and sales center is cooperating with farmers, which is very much needed in reality, because the cotton produced by farmers can be directly traded with yarn factories, avoiding the profiteering of small vendors. At the same time, the Agricultural Bank can also provide as much loans as possible for farmers' production, so as to avoid the pain of general usury exploitation. Feng once visited County Head Zhou Heng on the same day to inquire about everything. On the 18th, he inspected the cotton area in Changyinsha and prepared for the establishment of the cotton production and sales center.</p>
<h3>Changzhou Fishing Boat Robbed, Multiple People Injured and Killed</h3>
<p>The Fengshun Bridge River outside the East Gate of Wuyi County has always been a gathering place for fishing boats. At about 2:00 AM on the morning of the 17th, in the middle of the night, multiple armed bandits suddenly arrived and searched each fishing boat. The fishermen were startled from their sleep and worked together to resist. The bandits were very angry and opened fire, causing fisherman Wang Jinfa to be the first to be shot, falling to the ground and dying. Zhang Yushou, Zhang Qilin, and Sun Xu's wife were all injured and fell to the ground. The remaining fishermen, seeing the situation was not good, hid in the cabin and allowed them to rob as they pleased. It took a long time before they left with their loot. Afterwards, at dawn, the injured were sent to Wujin Hospital for treatment. The corpse of Wang Jinfa, who was killed, was reported by the nearby police station to the county court, which sent personnel to inspect it.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou All Teachers and Staff Demand Salaries</h3>
<p>All the teachers and staff in this city have only been paid up to February by the Education Bureau, and the rest of the month has not been paid. Therefore, starting on the afternoon of the 10th of this month, they have been going to the Education Bureau for several days to demand payment. The bureau only agreed to pay over three hundred yuan first, but the teachers and staff felt that this amount was too small, and each person would only receive one or two yuan. They demanded that the bureau pay eight hundred yuan, but the bureau refused, so there was no result in the morning. In the afternoon, the teachers and staff went to the Education Bureau to demand payment.</p>
<h3>Two Die from Eating Pufferfish</h3>
<p>Zhou Yongqing, a boatman, went to Jiangnan to sell pigs. On his way back, he bought a basket of small fish near Lujin Town, including several small pufferfish. Unexpectedly, he was poisoned after eating them. When the boat arrived at Chelu Town, he tried to seek medical treatment, but it was too late. Two of them died due to severe poisoning, with cyanotic faces, twitching limbs, and bleeding from their mouths and noses. The scene was terrible. The other two ate less and only felt unwell, but their lives were not in danger.</p>
<h3>70-Year-Old Man Commits Suicide in Anger</h3>
<p>Li Kangyi, a boatman in Qiaoyao Township, the eleventh district of the county, is 70 years old and has been widowed for many years. He has two sons, but his eldest daughter-in-law is exceptionally shrewish and often abuses her younger brother-in-law. Because of this, the father-in-law and daughter-in-law are not on good terms. The other day, his daughter-in-law suddenly beat her younger brother-in-law again. Kangyi tried to stop her but failed. In a moment of anger, he secretly went to the room and hanged himself.</p>
<p>When the family discovered it, he had already died of suffocation.</p>
<h3>Ancient Bronze Vase from the Ming Dynasty Discovered</h3>
<p>The other day, several women were fishing in the Lotus Pond of Wangjia Xia, in the third district of the county. One woman felt a hard object under her feet and used force to take it out. It was an ancient bronze vase, two feet high, with ears on both sides. The bottom of the vase had the seal characters "Dazheng," which was determined to be an ancient object from the Ming Dynasty. There were also dozens of ancient coins in the vase, which were later purchased by Township Head Zou for 2,000 cash.</p>
<h3>Gambling Craze in Fengjing Town, Jiashan</h3>
<p>Xu Zhirong, the director of the Fengjing Town Public Security Branch, has long held a firm determination to eliminate gambling. The other day, he personally led the police to arrest gamblers. The gamblers fled in all directions, falling into the river and swimming, and some were injured by falls and trampling. Afterwards, a group of people carried the injured to the front of the Public Security Bureau and demanded medical treatment. The Public Security Bureau Chief sternly refused. The crowd then incited public outrage and rushed in, destroying all the equipment, doors, and windows in the bureau. Director Xu, seeing the situation was not good, fled through the back door. His brother-in-law, who happened to be working in the office, was grabbed and severely beaten by the crowd, critically injuring him, and his life was in danger. That night, Director Xu reported to the county general bureau and requested instructions from the county government. It is reported that the county government has sent a large police team to arrest the rioting crowd.</p>
<h3>New Life Movement Lantern Festival</h3>
<p>The New Life Movement Promotion Association of this county held an inaugural meeting on the 12th. The city residents initiated a lantern festival, which was held on the evening of the 16th. A large number of lanterns were exquisite and delicate, mostly rented from Xiashi, totaling more than a thousand kinds. The spectators were packed like sardines, and all the newspapers issued extra editions. It is estimated that the total cost of the night reached one million cash. The five towns of Xitang, Xu, Chengxi, Fengjing, and Hongjiatan also held the event at the same time or one after another, which must have been a lively affair.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing Preparing to Organize a National Products Production and Sales Cooperative Company</h3>
<p>Gu Ni and other merchants and residents of Jiaxing, in order to promote national products and revitalize the market, have reached an agreement with the Shanghai Chinese Products Production and Sales Cooperative Company to organize a branch company in Jiaxing. All goods will be newly supplied by the Shanghai headquarters, and the price will be equal to the ex-factory price, so that those who love national products can purchase them nearby. They have raised an office fund of 30,000 yuan and have rented the newly built four-story building of Beicheng Jiwang Wu Bridge to arrange everything. It is planned to add an amusement park on the third floor. After the arrangement is completed, it will be opened.</p>
<h3>Subsidy for Cocoon Market to Issue Substitute Vouchers</h3>
<p>Because the silkworm season in the four townships is about to enter the major dormancy period and new cocoons will be on the market soon, the number of cocoon factories opened is still few. The reason is due to the economic impact. Now, Chiang Lai-hsien and Chen Ching-hsien, members of the Sericulture Improvement Committee, propose to issue substitute vouchers during the cocoon season to facilitate transactions. They have drafted a method and resolved it by the Sericulture Improvement Committee. Now, Wu Ho-shu, a member of the committee, believes that the issuance of substitute vouchers is an innovation, and carelessness can easily lead to abuses. He has drafted regulations for the organization of a voucher management committee to clarify powers and responsibilities, and has submitted a proposal to the Sericulture Improvement Committee for resolution and implementation.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Tangjia Dike Robbery and Murder</h3>
<p>Yu Yingsan, the owner of the Xian Detang Pharmacy at Tangjia Dike Road, Jinzhi Township, the third district of Yuyao, has a modest family fortune. His wife has passed away, and his son Pei-yi and his wife are also helping in the store. The family is quite comfortable. Unexpectedly, at about 1:00 AM yesterday (16th), seven or eight bandits suddenly arrived and broke through the door of the store with a huge stone, rushing into the inner room. Several bandits guarded the front and back doors, and the remaining bandits used handguns and Mauser pistols to threaten and silence them, and then searched in different directions. Later, because they were not satisfied with what they found, they ordered Yu to hand over the money, but their wish was not fulfilled, causing the bandits to be angry. They fired five shots from the Mauser pistol and killed Yu. His son Pei-yi, seeing his father being killed, was extremely angry and rushed out of the front door, shouting for help. He was also shot and killed by the bandit guarding the door. The bandits then gathered their loot and fled eastward. After checking the losses, it was estimated that gold, jewelry, silver dollars, and clothing worth 10,000 were robbed. By the time the nearby defense corps heard the alarm and pursued them, the bandits had disappeared.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing Police Firing Sparks Market Strike</h3>
<p>On the 17th, a conflict occurred in Tangpu Town, Shaoxing, because the police and reserve soldiers were arresting gamblers in Wu A-yun's tea shop in Zhongjie, due to a misunderstanding. Fang Shirong, the patrol officer of the Fourth Branch, immediately led more than ten armed police officers to the tea shop, but the soldiers of each team had already dispersed. Unexpectedly, the police fired Mauser pistols into the shop to demonstrate, and then took the owner's wife to the station for questioning, which aroused the public anger of the citizens of the town. A citizens' meeting was held in the town office, and it was decided to petition the county government to dismiss and investigate the patrol officer. On one hand, four representatives were assigned to come to the city to petition the county government. On the other hand, all the markets were on strike to await resolution. Currently, in addition to ordering all stores to open as usual immediately, the county government has sent Inspector Yi from the Public Security Bureau to investigate and resolve the dispute.</p>

<h3>Arrival Situation</h3>
<p>Mr. Song took Eurasia No. 2 aircraft from Xi'an at 6:30 AM yesterday morning to return to Shanghai, without stopping along the way. At 12:40 PM in the afternoon, he safely landed at Hongqiao Airport. After Mr. Song got off the plane, he shook hands with each of the welcomers to thank them.

<h3>Mr. Soong Tse-ven Flies from Shensi to Shanghai for Photography (Photo by Gong Shuxian of the Asia East Agency)</h3>
<p>It is expected that Mr. Soong will meet with Mr. Kong Xiangxi, Mr. Zhang Gongquan, and others within the next few days to discuss the establishment of the Construction Bank Corporation. As for his trip to Sichuan, it will be decided after the Construction Bank Corporation is established.</p>
<h3>Gong Zizhi Discusses the Recent Situation in Yunnan Province; Will Go to the Capital Soon to Report to the Authorities; Hopes for Immigrants to Develop the Area</h3>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, Gong Zizhi, a member of the Yunnan Provincial Government and Director of the Department of Education, recently arrived in Shanghai. A reporter from Xin Xin News Agency made a special visit to his temporary residence. According to him, the situation in the province is quite detailed.</p>
<h3>Detour to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Mr. Gong first stated that this time he went north, intending to understand the social situation and educational conditions in various places, and made a detour through the provinces of Guangxi and Guangdong, which delayed him for quite some time. He departed from Kunming, passed through Hanoi (British Burma), arrived at Lang Son, and from Lang Son to Longzhou in Guangdong. He then passed through Nanning, Liuzhou, Guilin, and Wuzhou in Guangxi, and returned to Guangzhou. He arrived in Hong Kong, and only yesterday came to Shanghai from Hong Kong. He conducted inspections along the way to borrow experiences for improvements after returning to the province.</p>
<h3>Abundant Products</h3>
<p>He continued, "Yunnan has a vast territory and many mountains. According to population statistics, there are more than 12 million people, but they are scattered in remote areas and are very sparsely populated. The abundance of products in the province probably exceeds that of all the provinces south of the Yangtze River. Such as grain, timber, and various minerals are all special products of the province. Tin ore is the most abundant, followed by gold and silver mines. However, the transportation aspect is slightly inconvenient, which is quite regrettable."</p>
<h3>Goods In and Out</h3>
<p>"Most of the various goods imported into the province are purchased from Guangzhou and Shanghai. Cotton cloth is the most important imported commodity, followed by gasoline, kerosene, and foreign groceries. The main exports are tin (he called it 'big tin'), and other various minerals and timber. Each month, the amount of exports exceeds the amount of imports when compared."</p>
<h3>Cultural Progress</h3>
<p>Mr. Gong further stated, "The people there have gradually become knowledgeable since they were enlightened, and in recent years, many people have entered schools to study. However, there are still uncivilized aborigines in remote areas. There is one provincial university, more than one hundred middle schools, and about eight hundred or more elementary schools in the province. There are also more than ten news agencies. Therefore, the cultural aspect is also progressing daily."</p>
<h3>Report to the Capital</h3>
<p>"After staying in Shanghai for two or three days, I plan to go to the capital to visit the central authorities, report on my experiences, and hope that young people from various places will immigrate there to develop the area, so that the abundantly productive Yunnan will not be occupied by others. This is my wish," he said.</p>

<h3>Banking Circles Pay Attention to Rural Relief; Investment in Rural Areas Has Increased Greatly in Recent Years; Rumors of Focusing on Government Bonds Are Inaccurate</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, several newspapers published reports the day before yesterday that banking circles in the city were concentrating their efforts on government bond business. Yesterday, a magnate in the local banking circles stated to a reporter from the Central News Agency that these reports were completely inaccurate, and further stated that the business situation of the local banking circles has always been dominated by real estate investment and government bond operations. However, this has gradually changed in recent years. Because the bank authorities have seen that various industries in various places are declining and the countryside is declining, they have used the funds for operating real estate and government bonds for loans to various manufacturers and rural areas in the past year. The amount of loans made by various banks to merchants such as cotton yarn, flour, tea, and silk has increased greatly in the past year, and the results of the rural lending activities of the farmers' lending offices established by various banks in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Henan, and other provinces are also increasing day by day. The local banking circles have considerable financial strength. On the one hand, they seek the development of their own business, and on the other hand, they take into account the decline of rural finance, which urgently needs relief. Engaging in rural economic relief is the development of the bank's own future.</p>
<h3>Huang Fu Visited Kong Yesterday Morning to Discuss Financial Affairs in North China</h3>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, Huang Fu, Chairman of the Administrative Yuan's Political Reorganization Committee stationed in Beiping, drove to the private residence of Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi on West Ainsworth Road at 9:45 yesterday morning to discuss the reorganization of financial affairs in North China. The discussion lasted for more than an hour, and he did not leave until 10:50. A reporter from Xin Xin News Agency interviewed Mr. Huang at Mr. Kong's residence. According to him, he will stay in Shanghai for a few more days. On the way back north, in addition to a brief stay in the capital, he does not plan to go to Gan to visit Chairman Chiang. This morning's visit to Finance Minister Kong was to discuss the issue of financial reorganization in North China. The results of the discussion were very satisfactory. When Mr. Huang talked about this, the reporter asked about his opinion on the three principles decided by the League of Nations Manchurian Affairs Advisory Committee on postal transportation through the puppet territory. He replied that he had only seen the news about the League of Nations' decision in today's newspaper. He had not received a report and did not know what the content was, so he had no opinion to express. Moreover, the postal issue is within the scope of the transportation authorities and is not under his jurisdiction.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Circles Commemorated Chen Ying-shi Yesterday; The Municipal Party Headquarters Held a Memorial Meeting; The Lake Society Also Held a Public Memorial Ceremony</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the eighteenth anniversary of the martyrdom of the late martyr Chen Ying-shi. Various circles in the city held a memorial meeting at the Municipal Party Headquarters. At the same time, fellow townsmen from Huzhou held a public memorial ceremony at the Lake Society on Guizhou Road and Beijing Road. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Memorial Meeting of Various Circles</h3>
<p>The Municipal Party Headquarters convened representatives from various circles to hold a memorial meeting in the auditorium of the Party Headquarters at Fenglin Bridge. A banner reading "Shanghai Municipal Representatives from Various Circles Hold the Eighteenth Anniversary Memorial Meeting for the Late Martyr Chen Ying-shi" was hung high above the door. The layout of the auditorium was also very solemn. More than 200 representatives from various circles attended. Pan Gongzhan, a member of the Municipal Party Headquarters, presided over the meeting and reported. Wang Hanliang, a representative from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and others gave speeches. The speeches were very sincere and detailed.</p>
<p>After the US Silver Bill Was Passed</p>
<h3>Banking Circles Believe Silver Prices Can Be Stabilized; The Outflow of Silver from China Will Not Have a Major Impact; The Enactment of the Silver Bill Is Not Related to the Rogers Investigation</h3>
<p>According to the New Sound News Agency, a leading figure in the local banking circles said yesterday regarding the silver bill negotiated in Washington that the situation is very good, and the silver price will tend to stabilize in the future due to regulations. According to his personal observation, the United States will implement a bimetallic system of gold and silver. The first point in the silver bill is the regulation of silver as currency, which will be announced in a mandatory manner. The banking figure also believes that the regulation of the silver price at US$1.29 will raise the current silver price when the United States implements the purchase, but the limit of the increase will be US$1.29. It is difficult to avoid the outflow of silver from China in the future, but the amount is limited. Although the United States intends to buy silver, so that it accounts for 25% of the total reserves, namely 1.8 billion ounces, this number will not be purchased at one time. It is feared that it will be purchased according to the number of US annual purchases stipulated by the London Silver Association. Moreover, China's silver reserves are not the largest, which can be known from the regulations of the London Silver Association. Therefore, in the future, countries with the largest silver reserves, such as India and Spain, will flow to the United States the most. Moreover, the report that the US will allow the UK to repay some of its debts with silver, and the rumor that the reason why President Roosevelt and the US silver faction were able to enact this bill this time was due to the results of Rogers' report in Shanghai, are not true. President Roosevelt's decision on this matter will not be shifted by the situation in a corner of the Far East.</p>
<p>Sincere and detailed</p>
<p>Representatives from various agencies, schools, and groups attended, including the Songhu Garrison Command, the General Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Board of Education, the Citizens' Union of the Second Special District, the Antique Industry Association, the South Goods Trade Union, the Garment Trade Union, the Labor Education Association, the Cooperative Business Promotion Association, the Public Education Hall, the Hunan District Farmers' Association, the Women's National Goods Year Movement, the Chinese Youth Association, the Silk and Satin Cloth Workers' Union, the Jiangsu Fellow Townsmen Association, the Shandong Fellow Townsmen Association, Jiaotong University, Chizhi University, Fudan University, Dazhong Middle School, Jianguo Middle School, Yuchun, Jiangjing, Tanzhen, Feihong, Huben, Hudong, various primary and secondary schools, all staff members of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Party Headquarters of various districts, and representatives of various branch offices, totaling more than 200 people.</p>
<p>Meeting Order: (1) Opening of the meeting, (2) All stand at attention, (3) Sing the Party Song, (4) Pay the highest respect to the Party Flag, the National Flag, and the portrait of the Prime Minister, (5) Silent tribute, (6) Report by the chairman,</p>
<p>(7) Speech, (8) Shout slogans, (9) End of the ceremony</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Chairman Pan Gongzhan first gave a report, stating briefly that we are holding the memorial meeting for Mr. Chen Ying-shi here today. Recalling the heroic sacrifice of Mr. Chen for the country and the party 18 years ago, it is worthy of our permanent remembrance. There are about three points to report today: (1) The national environment is becoming more and more dangerous. All comrades should regard Mr. Chen's spirit of revolutionary struggle. Chen was one of the Prime Minister's most loyal followers. Although the political environment at that time was very bad, the danger in the international arena was not as great as it is today. Today, the country has lost millions of square miles of territory. Not only the four northeastern provinces have fallen into the hands of the enemy, but also the so-called areas of return and reception are nominally recovered. The Japanese manipulate traitors and have other intentions. The international situation is twice as dangerous as it was in the fourth and fifth years of the Republic of China. At that time, European countries were unable to take care of East Asia because they were engaged in wars, so the Japanese took the opportunity to force the Yuan government to conclude a treaty that would destroy the country. Today, European countries are preparing for the Second World War, and all the conditions have not been fully prepared. The Japanese, seeing this, have made progress step by step since the Mukden Incident, and the coercion is becoming more and more severe, which is more than twice as dangerous as when Mr. Chen was martyred 18 or 19 years ago. At this time, it is urgent for our comrades and compatriots to work together and emulate Mr. Chen's spirit of sacrifice and prepare to die for the country in order to protect our country. (2) Mr. Chen Ying-shi obeyed the leader consistently. He believed in the Prime Minister and lived and died with him. This can be seen from his letter to Mr. Huang Keqiang. The letter is attached to the Prime Minister's collection, because Huang still inevitably had doubts about the Prime Minister's claims at that time, so Mr. Ying-shi explained in detail and advised him to thoroughly realize the past erroneous thoughts, otherwise it would be an obstacle to the revolutionary cause. This spirit of obeying the leader can be used as an example for comrades who die later today. Some pretend to be comrades of the Kuomintang, but they change their minds halfway, and some try to be leaders and refuse to absolutely obey a certain leader consistently, so the unity of the party is not strong, and it is often split because they have not recognized the revolutionary line. Fighting for the party requires the discipline of the army. If the commander-in-chief of an army cannot command the lower-level generals, and the division and brigade commanders cannot command the soldiers, the march will inevitably fail. There is no doubt about it. If today's party members do not vow to sincerely obey the only leader, they will inevitably become a mob and cannot be cleaned up. Mr. Chen immediately went through fire and water upon receiving the Prime Minister's order at that time, and never hesitated. Today, all comrades should also emulate Mr. Ying-shi's spirit of obeying the leader, overcome difficulties when encountering difficulties, and overcome setbacks when encountering setbacks, so as not to live up to this memorial. (3) Today, we must thoroughly understand the meaning of Chairman Chiang's New Life Movement. The most important meaning of the New Life Movement is in propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame. Mr. Chen worked hard for the revolution and thought of the country in everything, which is the so-called "knowing shame is close to courage." Chen Guangsheng was originally a merchant. Because he witnessed the difficulties and dangers of the times, he resolutely abandoned his business and engaged in the revolution, refusing to die as an ordinary merchant. He went to Japan to study hard in police administration and searched for comrades in his spare time. When he met exemplary figures and studious students, he tried every means to recruit them. Today, if we read his family letters, we can know that he never thought of personal gain and was willing to help others. He was generous with his money and knew the meaning of integrity very well. Today, the party headquarters has a magnificent yamen. When Mr. Chen held cadre meetings in the past revolution, he often did so in pavilions, or in the halls of guest houses, schools, and shops. All these spirits can be used as examples for today's comrades. As for the words propriety and righteousness, Mr. Chen treated all parties and factions, regardless of the nine schools of thought, with the most appropriate attitude. He was gentle and elegant, never reckless. People, regardless of their age or status, each had their own roles, and the command was always satisfactory. Old scholars such as Wang Yiting and Ye Huijun (deceased) were happy to help. This is what Chairman Chiang meant by "propriety is a proper attitude." Gui is round and Ju is square. Each has its own wonderful use, without any mistakes. This is what is called propriety. As for righteousness, Chairman Chiang said it is proper behavior. Mr. Chen was brave and righteous. When attacking the Manufacturing Bureau, he could not be defeated for a long time. Mr. Chen entered the Manufacturing Bureau alone to persuade the defending troops. He had a truly fearless spirit and was especially admirable because he did not hesitate to sacrifice anything and was martyred for it. Yuan Shikai bought assassins to harm Mr. Chen before he was notified. Mr. Chen said that if he was afraid of death, he would not have come to participate in the revolutionary work. He embraced the heart of dying for the country and the party, and sacrificed himself. This is what is called righteousness. Therefore, Mr. Chen was able to put into practice the four words propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame in the New Life. In conclusion, first, we should emulate the martyrs for the national environment and prepare for the final sacrifice. Second, all comrades should work hard in their respective positions and obey the leader, and there should be no phenomena of division. Third, everyone must conscientiously and earnestly implement propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame in order to fulfill the meaning of the New Life Movement. Today, during the Chen Ying-shi Memorial Period, I would like to offer these three points to all comrades. Afterwards, Wang Hanliang gave a speech, briefly reporting on his acquaintance with Mr. Chen Ying-shi.</p>
<h3>Lake Society Public Memorial Ceremony</h3>
<p>The Chen Ying-shi Phantom Hall of the Lake Society on Beijing Road also held a memorial and public memorial ceremony for the eighteenth anniversary of the martyrdom of the late martyr Chen Ying-shi at 10:00 yesterday morning. In addition to members of the Lake Society, more than 300 students from Huzhou's Shanghai primary and secondary schools and Jingxiong Girls' School also participated. Wang Yiting presided over the ceremony, Yan Junxuan and Zhao Xichen accompanied the ceremony, Yao Yinfo read the memorial text, Shen Tianxin presided over the meeting, and Shen Yanxiang was the master of ceremonies. The details are recorded below: The layout of the meeting hall was in the auditorium of the Lake Society. On the stage was a portrait of the late martyr Ying-shi. In front of the portrait were three large wreaths, which were placed in a glass cabinet. There was also a bottle of fresh flowers, which was placed on the altar. The altar was surrounded by flower pots. All the layouts were very simple, and the atmosphere of the meeting hall was also very solemn.</p>
<p>After the public memorial ceremony was performed, the presiding officer Wang Yiting respectfully presented flowers in front of the portrait of the late martyr Chen Ying-shi. After Yinfo read the memorial text, everyone bowed three times to the portrait of the late martyr Chen Ying-shi. Then Jingxiong Girls' School and Huzhou Primary and Secondary School sang a memorial song. Then Yan Junxuan reported on the history of the late martyr Chen, and the guests gave speeches. The words are omitted from the length. The meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>Public Memorial Text Only on May 18, the 23rd year of the Republic of China, all the members of the Huzhou Society publicly mourn the spirit of our late martyr Chen Gong Ying-shi, alas,</p>

<h3>Mr. Yan's Report</h3>
<p>Yan Junxuan reported on the brief history of the late martyr Chen, saying briefly that Chen joined the revolution eight years before the Republic of China, went to Japan in the Yiwei year to join the Tongmenghui, and then was ordered to return to China to plan to support the revolution in the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. In March of the Xinhai year, he participated in the Guangzhou battle. During the Wuchang Uprising, Mr. Chen attacked the Manufacturing Bureau with his bare hands and was detained for one night. In the second year of the Republic of China, Song Jiaoren was assassinated, and Mr. Chen helped to arrest the murderer. In the third year of the Republic of China, he presided over the party affairs of the Chinese Revolutionary Party, and later participated in revolutionary movements in Shanghai, Jiangyin, and Zhejiang.</p>
<p>He was finally resented by the thief Yuan and was assassinated to death in Shanghai. Mr. Chen ran for the revolution tirelessly and made great achievements. He was truly the predecessor of our revolutionary patriots. There were also speeches by various people, and the words are omitted from the length.</p>
<h3>Half-mast to Express Grief</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the anniversary of the martyrdom of Mr. Chen Ying-shi, a founding father of the Party and the country. In addition to the memorial meeting held by the Municipal Party Headquarters with representatives from all walks of life in the city and the meeting held by members of the Lake Society on Guizhou Road, all agencies, groups, schools, and party headquarters in the city, recognizing Mr. Chen's merits in the Party and the country and his immortal spirit, which is truly a model for future generations, lowered the flag to half-mast to express their grief and condolences.</p>
<h3>Stone Pagoda Opened</h3>
<p>The Chen Ying-shi Memorial Pagoda at the intersection of the Republic of China Road in the West Gate is open all day every year on the anniversary of the death of the late martyr Chen. Yesterday was the eighteenth anniversary, so it was reopened for one day from early morning. From 6:00 PM, the reflective lights installed on the surrounding electric poles shone like daylight, and the top of the pagoda also shone brightly to arouse the citizens' admiration for the late martyrs.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai-Yantai-Guda Water Line Was Initially Checked and Completed Yesterday, and Will Be Sorted Out Today and Received and Sent Tomorrow Morning</h3>
<p>According to the Dabaisha News Agency, the Datong and Dabeiliang companies requested to undertake the submarine cable between Shanghai, Yantai, and Guda in the 26th year of Guangxu (1900). Now, the Ministry of Communications has prepared funds to take it back and issued a notice that from the 20th, our side will start receiving and sending affairs. This abandonment of 33 years of sovereignty has been achieved after repeated negotiations. The details are controlled as follows:</p>
<h3>Reception Completed</h3>
<p>The reception affairs were carried out by Shen Fuhai, Lin Zhaoxiang, Wang Bonian, and other three waterline engineers sent by the Ministry of Communications. At 8:00 AM yesterday, they went to Wusong with Bai Sheng Bosen, representatives of the Datong and Dabeiliang companies, and two engineers to inspect for a week. They immediately handed over one by one and were received by us. At the same time, the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau also sent personnel to prepare for the technology and wiring of receiving and sending telegrams. The procedures were completed at about 6:00 PM in the afternoon. Today, our side will completely sort out all places. It is heard that tomorrow (Sunday)</p>
<p>Continue to work in order to send the report, without any difficulty, so the work in recent days is extremely busy.</p>
<h3>The Line Room Will Be Relocated</h3>
<p>During the Datong and Dabeiliang period, the line room was originally set up in Wusong, which is the hub of the submarine cable landing. From here, the lines of the receiving and sending agencies of the newspaper service are connected, which is very important. Now, Shen Fuhai and the engineering personnel of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau believe that the location is not very suitable for our future receiving and sending newspaper services, so it is planned to relocate to the Yunzaobang area. They are currently inspecting there and will be realized soon.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Government Welcomes the Panchen Lama to Shanghai; The Panchen Lama Is Unwilling to Live in the Concession and Is Looking for an Address in the Chinese Territory</h3>
<p>The Panchen Lama Master hosted the Kalachakra Tantra Dharma Assembly in Hangzhou, which has now been completed. After sending the Shrine on the 18th, he will rest in Hangzhou for another day, and then leave Hangzhou on the 20th. Wu Tiecheng, the mayor of the city, had previously sent Yang Hu, the director of the Security Office, to Hangzhou to invite the Panchen Lama Master to visit Shanghai for several days after the completion of the Dharma Assembly. It is now known that the Panchen Lama Master has already replied to Mayor Wu by telegram and will accept the invitation to come to Shanghai. The municipal government originally planned to entertain the Panchen Lama Master in the Hardoon Garden in the Public Concession, but because the Panchen Lama Master is unwilling to choose a residence in the Concession, the municipal government is looking for a suitable address in the Chinese territory for the Panchen Lama Master to live in when he comes to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Notifies the Solicitation of Proposals for the General Assembly and Sets a Deadline for Payment and Re-election of Representatives</h3>

<h3>After the Closure of the Old British-American Tobacco Factory, Workers at the New Factory Went on a Slowdown Strike Yesterday to Show Support. Party and Government Officials Were Dispatched to Investigate in Detail and Mediate. The Company Held an Emergency Meeting to Discuss Countermeasures.</h3>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, after the closure of the British-American Tobacco Company's old factory in Pudong, the labor union held an emergency representatives' conference, which resolved that workers at the new factory would stage a slowdown strike to show support. This was implemented starting yesterday morning. A petition was also submitted to the central government to sanction the factory for closing down. Party and government agencies dispatched personnel to investigate in detail and seek mediation. The detailed situation is as follows:</p>
<h3>Slowdown Strike Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The Fifth District Cigarette Industry Workers' Union held an emergency representatives' conference the night before last, which resolved on a slowdown strike to show support. Yesterday morning, after the workers in various sections of the new factory entered the factory, they immediately implemented the slowdown strike. Except for the tin packaging section, box section, and carriage section, where work was suspended today and there is nothing to report, the tin foil section, coppersmith section, printing department, proofing section, and warehouse department all followed the conference's proposal and unanimously went on a slowdown strike to support the old factory workers. The Third District Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Police Brigade stationed in Pudong were on guard near the factory site.</p>
<h3>Party and Government Mediation</h3>
<p>After the workers at the new factory went on a slowdown strike, they decided that if the factory management did not come to their senses, they would escalate from a slowdown strike to a full strike starting next Thursday. The Social Affairs Bureau specially dispatched Wang Gang, a staff member of the Third Section, yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, to inspect the old factory in North Pudong, together with Lu Yinchu, a cadre of the Civil Training Section of the Municipal Party Headquarters. In addition to investigating in detail and reporting to the municipal government for instructions, they also went to the company at 2:00 PM to find ways to mediate, in order to prevent the dispute from escalating.</p>
<h3>Company Meeting</h3>
<p>Since the British-American Tobacco Company closed its old factory in Pudong, it is said that the reasons were: (1) poor business, (2) difficulty in managing workers. Workers at the old factory were all given severance pay in accordance with factory law regulations. After the workers at the new factory went on a slowdown strike, an emergency meeting was held inside the company on Suzhou Road yesterday morning at 11:00 AM to discuss solutions. It is said that it was decided to petition the Municipal Government Social Affairs Bureau to stop the workers' actions and protect the factory's property.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Board of Directors</h3>
<p>The union sent a letter to the company's board of directors yesterday, stating: "Greetings. This union has investigated that Company No. 1 has been open for more than 30 years and is the originator of all the company's factories in China. The profits it has earned are no less than tens of millions, all the result of the blood and sweat of our workers. In the past two months, the company has repeatedly reduced work, treating the laws and regulations of our national government as worthless. Our workers, in order to preserve harmonious labor-management relations, have endured the pain and continued to work. What they expect from the factory is not insignificant. Without the approval of party and government agencies, as well as the permission of this union, the company suddenly closed the old factory on the 12th of this month and slandered the workers as disobedient. Is this how the company rewards meritorious workers? How cruel is this? As for the reasons the company holds for closing the factory, they are nothing more than poor business and workers' disobedience. On these two points alone, has the company fallen into bankruptcy to the point of closing the factory? Are the workers disobedient? The facts are all there, and right and wrong will be judged fairly. It is impossible to deceive everyone in the world. Now that this unfortunate incident has already occurred, the livelihoods of thousands of workers are in dire straits, and they are likely to sacrifice themselves for the factory. It is not too late for the company to pull back from the brink. In order to preserve friendly relations between the two sides, this representatives' conference makes a sincere recommendation, hoping that you will restore Factory No. 1 as soon as possible. The solution is urgent. If the company continues to be stubborn, and a major mistake is made in the future, your company will bear the responsibility. We offer a humble suggestion and hope you will consider it carefully."</p>
<h3>Automatic Telephones in the Longhua District of the Telephone Bureau Will Be Activated at Midnight Tonight. Pick Up the Receiver and Listen for a Buzzing Sound Before Dialing the Number. Call the Concession by Dialing '0'; Call Long Distance by Dialing '40.'</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications issued a notice yesterday, stating: "The installation of automatic telephone equipment in the Longhua District of this Bureau has been completed. It has been decided to officially open the telephone service at 11:00 PM on the 19th of this month. Before 11:00 PM, users must still report their numbers as before. After 11:00 PM, they can use the rotary dialer. The method of use is the same as in the Nanshi and Zhabei districts. During the transition between the old and new systems, there may be interruptions. We hope for your understanding. The new numbers for users have already been distributed. This is a special announcement. When a user wants to make a call, pick up the receiver and listen for a 'buzzing' sound. Then, dial the number of the desired user. To call a user in the Concession, dial '0' first, and then have the operator manually connect the call. To make a long-distance call, dial '40.' Therefore, all procedures are the same as for automatic telephone users in Nanshi and Zhabei districts."</p>
<p>····················</p>
<h3>Document Submitted to the Central Government</h3>
<p>The Fifth District Cigarette Workers' Union submitted a document to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Central People's Movement Committee, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry, stating: "Regarding the British-American Tobacco Company's unjustified closure of the factory and disregard for laws and regulations, we earnestly request an impartial remedy. The British-American Tobacco Company in Pudong, Shanghai, suddenly closed Factory No. 1 on the 12th of this month for no reason [omitted, see later announcement to all circles]. We earnestly request that your council, considering that the workers of this union contributed to the party and the country by regaining the national tax in the sixteenth year of the Republic, forward the matter to the relevant ministry and expedite negotiations to achieve the goal of restoring the factory. Rebuilding the cause can show gratitude today, and the grateful kindness will be repaid in the future. We humbly submit our petition with tears and await your approval and instructions. We will also petition the Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and the Social Affairs Bureau on a regular basis."</p>
<h3>Formation of the Factory Restoration Association</h3>
<p>The union, through a representatives' meeting, decided to specially organize a Factory Restoration Demand Committee and elected Chen Peide, Liu Dehua, Lou Jingguan, Xiao Gengsheng, Ren Zhengxiang, Fei Ke, Xie Peiji, Bao Yangzhou, Hu Xiaomei, Zhang Ziping, Chen Shaoqing, Yin Ligeng, Hang Lindi, Gu Bingguo, Liu Yutang, Zhang Yuqing, Lv Yan, Chen Qingchang, Wang Xiaomei, Dong Aosheng, Zhang Shufang, Ren Kunda, Xuan Zengrong, Zheng Liming, Zhu Ahao, Hong Meiquan, Wang Ajin, Li Chunde, Zhang Awu, Wang Fa, Zang Shilin, Zhang Jinjia, Zhou Guiying, Wang Amao, Zhang Zhenxuan, Wang Dian'an, Wang Zhaoliang, Tang Jintang, Xu Meizhen, and other thirty-nine people as committee members. If there are no results, it will be changed to a strike committee to confront the factory.</p>
<p>The first committee meeting is scheduled for 5:00 PM on the 21st.</p>
<h3>Announcement to All Circles</h3>
<p>The union issued an announcement to all circles yesterday, stating: "To the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, all newspapers, all public organizations, all British-American Tobacco factories' unions, and all elders, brothers, sisters, and compatriots in the national labor community: Alas, the old factory of the British-American Tobacco Company in Pudong, which has been open for more than thirty years, has been closed for no reason! Like a bolt from the blue, it has suddenly arrived. The livelihoods of more than three thousand workers in the entire factory have been plunged into despair. It is unbearable to describe the heartbreak and tragedy. Looking back, the old factory has been open for more than thirty years and is the originator of all the company's factories in China. The profits it has earned are no less than tens of millions, all the result of the blood and sweat of our workers. In recent years, the company's management authority has been unable to unify, often causing disputes. However, the workers deeply know that the national crisis has not been resolved and have made concessions step by step. The company has taken advantage of the opportunity and taken an inch after every inch. Last month, the factory used the excuse of poor business to continuously reduce work. After receiving the Municipal Government's decision and Instruction No. 30 ordering compliance, the factory was not allowed to reduce working hours without submitting a request to the responsible agency for approval. Unexpectedly, the factory refused to comply and once again arbitrarily reduced working hours on the 10th of this month, only working thirty-six hours per week. This union believed that it was difficult to maintain workers' livelihoods, so it once again petitioned party and government agencies. We also received Social Affairs Bureau Instruction No. 3614, which ordered the factory to postpone implementation. This union was fortunate that workers' lives were somewhat guaranteed. Who would have thought that the company would close the old factory on the 12th of this month, citing poor labor and workers' disobedience? When all the workers went to work, they saw that the doors were tightly closed and realized the inside story. Everyone cried out in despair and vowed to sacrifice themselves for the factory. Alas, the situation is so tragic. The factory recently used new high-speed machines to increase speed and also entrusted the production of raw materials to Flag and other factories, resulting in overproduction, which has nothing to do with business. This is one point. As for the workers serving in the factory, how can they be said to be disobedient? Party and government agencies can be informed, so how can they fabricate something out of thin air? This is the second point. Factories are not allowed to close unless they have reached the point of bankruptcy. Regulations state that factory closures must be submitted to the responsible official agency for approval in advance. Even if the factory's claims of poor business and workers' disobedience were true, there would be no reason to close the factory. Now, they are acting freely, using the unfounded words of 'unnecessary' to put thousands of workers to death. The treatment of meritorious workers is so cruel, and the contempt for our national government's laws and regulations is also like this. This is the fourth point. Recently, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has been promoting labor-management harmony and has issued a general order stating that workers must not strike and capitalists must not close factories, offering earnest warnings. The company is a foreign capitalist and should especially understand this meaning. They rely on power and disregard justice, which can be described as extremely stubborn. The company's intention is nothing more than that the existing workers have too high wages and have worked for too long. After closing the factory, they can rely on paying a large amount of severance pay. When the factory resumes production in the future, they can hire new workers and further reduce wages. If this precedent is set, all British-American factories in China will follow suit, and other companies will follow suit. Workers' lives will have no guarantee, the number of unemployed will increase day by day, and what future can we imagine for the labor movement? In this dangerous situation, this union is heartbroken and willing to sacrifice everything. We respectfully lead all the workers, vowing to coexist or perish with the factory. The workers of this union have been working hard for more than thirty years, not only contributing to the factory, but also contributing to the party and the country by regaining the national tax in the sixteenth year of the Republic. We hope that the party and government authorities and all elders, brothers, sisters, and compatriots across the country will uphold justice and speak out for righteousness. Rebuilding the cause can show gratitude today, and the grateful kindness will be repaid in the future. We humbly submit our petition with tears and beg for your fair judgment."</p>
<h3>Fire Penalty Regulations Promulgated in Shandong Province Provoke Objections from Foreign Merchants and Insurance Companies. They Request Their Consuls to Lodge Protests.</h3>
<p>The "Chinese-language Newspaper" reports that Han Fuju, Chairman of Shandong Province, promulgated a public notice in February of this year, stating that in order to prevent fires, protect commercial districts, and maintain public safety, three temporary penalty regulations were specially issued: (1) Any commercial firm that has fire insurance and is suspected of causing a fire shall have all the compensation paid by the insurance company confiscated. Losses suffered by neighbors due to the fire shall be compensated by the insured party. (2) If a fire is proven to be due to an accident, 40% of the compensation shall be confiscated for public welfare and charitable purposes, and neighbors' losses shall also be compensated accordingly. (3) If a commercial firm without fire insurance causes a fire due to an accident, the owner shall be sentenced to one month of imprisonment. Initially, the managers of various insurance companies thought that this public notice was merely an official formality to maintain local discipline and prevent public danger, and that the insurance business could still be operated as usual without being affected. Unexpectedly, it was recently strictly enforced. A certain commercial firm had fire insurance of 20,000 yuan from a certain foreign firm, and another commercial firm had fire insurance of 16,000 yuan. Recently, they were both careless, but because the losses were not large, one was only compensated 400 yuan by the insurance company, and the other was compensated 700 yuan. However, the managers of the two commercial firms were immediately detained after the carelessness and ordered to pay a fine of 40% of the insured amount, one paying 8,000 yuan and the other paying 6,400 yuan. Since these two cases occurred, general commercial firms have not dared to take out fire insurance again, and those who have already insured have also cancelled their insurance one after another, causing the insurance business in Jinan to fall into silence. Therefore, the Jinan managers of foreign merchant insurance firms specially convened a meeting on May 4 to discuss this matter. It was immediately resolved to draft a uniform letter and send it to the Shanghai offices of the managers they represent, explaining all the difficulties and asking them to consult with their national consuls to negotiate with the Shandong provincial authorities to abolish this harsh regulation. Foreign merchant insurance firms in this port have received many such letters in recent days and do not know how to deal with them.</p>
<h3>W. P. Lambe Takes Office as a Director of the Shanghai Municipal Council</h3>

<h3>Yang Hu Returns to Shanghai from Hangzhou, Sailors Firmly Request Reinstatement</h3>
<p>Mr. Yang Hu, Director of the Shanghai Security Bureau, firmly resigned from his concurrent position as the convener of the Seamen's Union Preparatory Committee. He was repeatedly retained by seamen's organizations, and Wang Luyi, Director of the Central People's Movement Committee, was also specially requested to go to Hangzhou to persuade him to stay. Before he had dismissed his intention to resign, the Central Committee's 121st Standing Committee meeting once again resolved to grant Mr. Yang full responsibility for guiding the seamen's work. It can be seen from this that various parties do not want Mr. Yang to retire. Yesterday afternoon, Mr. Yang returned to Shanghai from Hangzhou to attend the Shishi Wheel Buddhist Service. He disembarked at Fanwangdu. It is heard that his intention to resign from the Seamen's Union Preparatory Committee remains firm. According to the persons in charge of various seamen's organizations, various seamen have been working on the issue of Mr. Yang's reinstatement in recent days.</p>

<h3>The Red Cross Society Hosted a Banquet for Various Public Organizations the Night Before Last</h3>
<p>Since the Chinese Red Cross Society began soliciting members, the government authorities and people from all walks of life have been very supportive. Recently, the number of new members has been increasing daily. The president of the association, Yu Qiaqing, and the standing committee member, Wang Xiaolai, hosted a banquet for representatives of various public organizations at the Hangzhou Restaurant on Avenue Edward VII at 7:00 PM the night before last. The attendees included Gu Xinyi, Wen Lanting, Lin Kanghou, Wu YunChu, Cheng Dejie, Wang Shiqiang, Chen Zixiang, Wang Hanliang, Tu Kaizheng, and others, totaling more than forty people. During the banquet, Yu Qiaqing and Wang Xiaolai successively gave speeches, stating that the Chinese Red Cross Society is an international charitable organization and has a considerable history since its establishment in the country. It has received definite evaluations from society and the government. Recalling the January 28th Shanghai Incident, our overseas Chinese compatriots enthusiastically contributed funds and supplies, which were all handed over to the Red Cross Society and transferred to our front-line troops, which proves the external trust in this association. The purpose of soliciting members this time is to increase the new cells of the association so that the association's affairs can be further developed in the future and make greater contributions to society and the country. They hoped that all sectors of society could provide support. As for the association's accounts, they adopted the most precise management methods and could be checked at any time, without the non-public aspects of other organizations. Then, Wang Hanliang gave a speech, stating that the Chinese Red Cross Society has a standing in the international community. With the national crisis at this point, our compatriots across the country, for the sake of the country and themselves, have a need to join the Red Cross Society. Although we do not necessarily have to go to the front lines to fight, we should also do auxiliary work in the rear. The achievements of the Chinese Red Cross Society in serving in the war zone during the Shanghai Incident were witnessed by the people of Shanghai. In the future, although we cannot clearly state when the world war will break out, judging from the current international situation, war seems inevitable. Therefore, we should join the Red Cross Society as soon as possible so that the association's strength can be further enriched and become an effective function of wartime service, etc. Then, Lin Kanghou and representatives of various public organizations also made sincere speeches. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves and dispersed at around 9:00 PM.</p>

<h3>The Shanghai Municipal Council Has Approved a Postponement for the Demolition of the Shanties on Yanshan Road. The Shantytown Residents Have Decided to Automatically Fill the Sewage Ditch.</h3>
<p>More than fifty shanties beside Yanshan Road, Qiqihar Road in East Shanghai have been ordered by the Public Concession Shanghai Municipal Council Health Office to be demolished before the 21st of this month due to sanitation concerns. As this concerns the livelihood of the poor, the New Voice News Agency reporter specially went to investigate the truth yesterday. The situation obtained is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Demolition Order</h3>
<p>There are more than fifty shanties, built in two rows, with a somewhat neat shape. They are located south of Qiqihar Road and north of Lan Road, with a total of more than two hundred shantytown residents, men, women, and children, mostly from Tongzhou and Yangzhou, all of whom are laborers, either pushing small carts or working as yarn factory workers. This time, the Public Concession Health Office found a sewage ditch beside the shanties, which, with the weather getting warmer, was detrimental to public health. Therefore, it ordered the demolition of all the shanties built there and the filling of the sewage ditch to improve sanitation.</p>
<h3>Representatives Petition</h3>
<p>After receiving the news, the shantytown residents appointed Gao Dianyuan, Gu Huaishu, Wang Jia Kuan, Ding Shuren, Yin Changsong, Chen Baoshan, etc. as representatives to petition the director of the Shanghai Municipal Council. He Dekui, the deputy director, received them. The representatives stated the poor and difficult circumstances, their inability to rent houses, and requested an extension to provide shelter from the wind and rain, so that after the demolition, more than two hundred poor and helpless women and children would have nowhere to go, and if a tragedy were to occur, who would bear the responsibility, etc. Director He agreed to convey the message to the director and give a reply later. After the representatives' efforts and the vigorous promotion by the taxpayer Chinese Association and Chinese directors, the health director and the works director have jointly consulted and temporarily postponed the demolition for one month, until June 21.</p>
<h3>Agreed Measures</h3>
<p>After receiving the news of the postponement, the representatives of the shantytown residents immediately consulted on the follow-up measures. The resulting decisions are as follows: (1) The Public Concession Health Office considers the sewage ditch on both sides of the shanties to be unsanitary. From now on, the shantytown residents will fill the ditch with coal ash and introduce the water from the ditch into the Longjiang Road creek. (2) As for the shanties being unsightly and unsanitary, there are dozens of dilapidated and low-lying bungalows on the north side of Yanshan Road, Lan Road, and the south side of Qiqihar Road. All the facilities and sanitation are similar. Why not demolish them? Therefore, if you want to demolish these fifty-odd shanties, you must demolish the above-mentioned dilapidated houses, and we will automatically demolish these fifty-odd shanties to enhance the view and improve sanitation. There is no need for the Labor Bureau to come and demolish them.</p>

<p>Municipal Government and Headquarters</p>
<h3>Strictly Prohibiting All Kinds of Narcotics; Manufacturing and Trafficking Will Be Punished by Death; Joint Proclamation to Be Implemented Soon</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government and the Songhu Garrison Headquarters yesterday received an order from the Military Affairs Commission's Nanchang Headquarters to strictly investigate and prohibit narcotics such as morphine, heroin, red pills, and white powder. The order also included the issuance of regulations strictly prohibiting potent narcotics. They immediately jointly issued a proclamation and instructed all military and police agencies to strictly implement it. The original order from Chairman Chiang and the regulations are copied below:</p>
<h3>Original Order</h3>
<p>In recent years, potent narcotics such as morphine, cocaine, heroin, red pills, and white powder have either been transported from abroad or from neighboring provinces, and resold and trafficked, flooding various parts of the Yangtze River region. These types of potent narcotics are very small in size, easy to carry, and extremely expensive, with substantial profits. Unscrupulous merchants, driven by profit, often smuggle them cleverly, and degenerate and unscrupulous military and police personnel often shield them. The flames of addiction spread, causing addiction in both urban and rural areas, affecting even women and children. Even in areas where opium is strictly prohibited, the spread of potent narcotics is even more prevalent. In today's economic bankruptcy, this adds another bone-sucking consumption. The harm caused is not only enough to ruin the country but also enough to exterminate the race. Provinces, aware of this drug scourge, have also frequently issued separate prohibition orders and strictly cracked down on it. However, this still cannot avoid the problem of tightening here and loosening there, giving cunning individuals the opportunity to avoid the severe punishment. Last year, when I was the Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression Headquarters in the provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, I issued an order to strictly investigate and prohibit anesthetic narcotics, all of which were to be severely punished according to military law, and ordered to be sent to military judicial organs for handling. However, the punishments for this type of crime in the military, naval, and air force criminal laws have not yet been clearly stipulated, and the penalties prescribed in the opium prohibition law are too light and cannot fully adapt to this special situation. Now, in order to eliminate the evil completely, I have specially formulated the Provisional Regulations on the Strict Prohibition of Potent Narcotics and ordered all provinces to follow them according to military law and strictly comply with them, so that the poisonous atmosphere spreading throughout the region can be effectively cleared and cleaned up in the shortest possible time. It is imperative that everyone understands this intention, breaks through personal relationships, conducts diligent and thorough investigations, and strictly enforces it, without treating it as mere formality, lest they incur severe reprimand. In addition to issuing telegrams, I am also issuing separate orders, and jointly issuing these regulations for compliance and instructing subordinates to be informed and to report the date of receipt of the document for record. This order includes the issuance of the Provisional Regulations on the Strict Prohibition of Potent Narcotics.</p>
<h3>Regulations</h3>
<p>Article 1: Morphine, cocaine, heroin, and their compounds or colored pills made by combining them, such as red and white pills, are all potent narcotics. Article 2: Those who manufacture or transport potent narcotics shall be sentenced to death. Article 3: Those who sell or possess potent narcotics with the intention of selling them shall be sentenced to death or life imprisonment.</p>

Article 7: Public officials who harbor, solicit, or accept bribes and condone others violating the provisions of these regulations shall be sentenced to death. The same applies to those who steal and exchange confiscated potent narcotics. Article 8: Those who falsely accuse others by planting potent narcotics shall be sentenced to death.

Article 12: Units with military judicial authority that discover violations of the provisions of these regulations may also try the case. Article 13: For all crimes violating these regulations, the entire file, along with the verdict, shall be directly submitted to the Garrison Headquarters for approval before execution.

Article 14: Matters not covered in these regulations shall be governed by the provisions of other laws and regulations. Article 15: Within five days of receiving this document, all military and political organs in various regions shall post public notices to inform everyone. Article 16: These regulations shall be implemented ten days after the publication of this document.</p>
<h3>A Filial Imbecile Beats His Aunt Behind Closed Doors, Scolds His Mother for Eating Too Many Vegetables, and Throws a Glass Milk Bottle at His Father - Aunt Intervenes and Is Brutally Beaten</h3>
<p>Fu Peilin from Shaoxing, formerly served as a customs officer at the Xiamen Jianghai Customs in Fujian. After the Fujian Incident, he resigned and brought his family to Shanghai, residing at No. 71 Male Li, Edward Road. He has a son and a daughter. The son, named Dingtai, is now 27 years old. However, Dingtai's character is usually bad, he does not work, he does not respect his elders, and he is unusually fierce. On August 16, 1932, he assaulted someone because he failed in harassing a woman and was arrested and sent to the court. He was sentenced to a fine of fifty yuan. Because he could not pay the fine, he was detained for fifty days. After being released from prison, his savage nature did not diminish, and his parents could do nothing about it. At about 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, when Fu Peilin and his family were having lunch, Fu Dingtai suddenly pointed at his mother for eating too many vegetables and made vulgar remarks. He also stated that his mother and others should not eat at the same table as him, which was completely unreasonable. When Fu Peilin heard this, he immediately scolded him. Unexpectedly, Dingtai not only did not listen but even dared to throw a glass milk bottle at him. At that time, Peilin's sister, Yuan Fu, saw this and stepped forward to intervene, which angered him. He then dragged Yuan Fu into the room, closed the door, and beat her severely with a wooden stick. Her eyes and hands were seriously injured. According to the provisional regulations,</p>

<p>She cried out for help. Fu Hui'e went out and called Huabu No. 550 and Detective Xu Dezhong, who arrested Fu Dingtai and took the wooden stick and milk bottle used in the assault to the Chengdu Road Police Station for detention. At the same time, the injured Yuan Fu was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police station lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, rose and detailed the case, saying that the police station is currently prosecuting the defendant for injury under Article 293, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code, but the injured person is the defendant's aunt, which is suitable for the crime of collateral relatives under Article 298, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code, and the original sentence should be increased by one-third. Then, Yuan Fu stated that she was 35 years old and the defendant was her nephew. Yesterday, because of a dispute during lunch, the defendant first tried to throw a milk bottle at his father. I stepped forward to persuade him, but he dragged me into the room, closed the door, and beat me severely with a wooden stick. My hands and eyes were injured, but he was still not satisfied and wanted to injure my lower body, but I was saved by calling for help. Now, please handle the case severely. Fu Peilin also testified that my son has always had a bad character and does not work, and about yesterday's assault on my sister. When questioned, the defendant's confession was ambiguous, and he did not admit the assault. Judge Huang Risheng ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and to have the court's forensic doctor verify Yuan Fu's injuries and reschedule the hearing for next Wednesday.</p>
<h3>Son Accuses Father of Theft, Requests Police Station to Investigate; Police Station Finds It Difficult to Accept</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at about 11:00 AM, a young man, dressed luxuriously and resembling an upper-class person, went to the Third Section of the First District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. He claimed to be Wang Jiashi, 25 years old, a local, and engaged in the antique business. He lived at No. 554 Xiaonanmen, Zhonghua Road, Nanshi. Now, because my biological father, Wang Wenzao, does not work and is undisciplined, he recently stole two rare sunstones worth more than three million yuan from my collection and pawned them for spending and is avoiding returning home. Therefore, I have come to the station to request that all police officers be notified to pay attention and strictly pursue my father, Wang Wenzao, and bring him to justice for legal punishment, etc. His voice and expression were stern when he spoke. However, the station felt that this case involved a son accusing his father of theft, which was unheard of. Therefore, they ordered him to file a lawsuit in the Shanghai Local Court according to law. Wang saw that the station would not accept the case and left angrily.</p>
<h3>Not Paying the Floating House Tax Leads to Phone Line Being Cut; Taxpayers' Association Sends Letter to Municipal Council Requesting Rectification</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association sent a letter to the General Office of the Public Concession Municipal Council yesterday, stating: "Dear Sirs, according to a letter from taxpayer Wang Chenggu, 'The taxpayer has been practicing law in Shanghai for many years. He previously established an office at No. 451 Jiangxi Road. Later, due to inconvenient transportation, he moved into the second floor of Zhejiang Road in March of this year and joined several other lawyers to form the Datong Law Firm to work. Because of the busy business, the original rooms were not enough, so the taxpayer rented an additional Room 205. The monthly rent for that room is 28 yuan, rented from March 21st, with receipts and books from the landlord Taichang Company as evidence. However, the Municipal Council's Tax Office forcibly wanted to collect an additional one yuan and three fen from March 11th. I immediately informed the Westerner Polais (transliteration) that if he did not correct the accounts, I would pay after a legal trial. Unexpectedly, the Westerner suddenly broke into the office at 2:00 PM on the 17th of last month accompanied by another Westerner (later known as Wilson). At that time, the taxpayer was talking to a client about a case when he heard the noise and came out of the room and saw them slamming the door and knocking on the walls, roaring like thunder, saying that if the rent was not paid immediately, they would remove the telephone and move things out of the house. They looked fierce and screamed and jumped. If the taxpayer had not remained calm, he would have been intimidated and succumbed. If someone was mentally weak, they would have been shocked to death. The office building was filled with people who came to watch after hearing the noise. Finally, the taxpayer had no choice but to reprimand them sternly, and the Westerner left angrily. Unexpectedly, the Tax Office, seeing that its plan had failed, later notified the Shanghai Telephone Company to cut off the taxpayer's telephone No. 91490 at 9:30 AM on the 5th of this month, in order to achieve its private goal of forcing submission. Later, the taxpayer sent a letter requesting immediate restoration of the phone and compensation for business losses. Unexpectedly, the Tax Office replied that the taxpayer's attitude was firm and they were not responsible for compensation, etc. It is understood that taxpayers have always paid taxes for house taxes according to law. The reason for temporarily delaying payment this time was that the amount heard did not match. It was inappropriate for the Tax Office not to correct the amount, and it was illegal to send someone to threaten unreasonably without following proper procedures. Now, knowing that taxpayers use the telephone and that it is essential for practicing law, they notified the Telephone Company to cut the line, pushing their behavior to the point where, if citizens do not pay the amount they arbitrarily set, they can notify the water company to cut off the water, the electricity company to cut off the electricity, the rice store not to sell rice, the vegetable market not to sell vegetables, the landlord not to rent houses, people not being allowed to walk on the road, and even patients being refused medicine by pharmacies, hospitals refusing treatment, funeral parlors refusing coffins for the dead, and guild halls refusing to store coffins. Isn't this unlimited power, and even the cruelty of violence is not as severe as this? Moreover, the telephone is installed in Room 206 and is shared by the Datong Law Firm, which has nothing to do with the house tax for Room 205. Now, because of a dispute over the donation of one taxpayer, the entire firm has no telephone. Similarly, if the taxpayer's residence is a Chinese-style house with a shared water meter in the alley, the Tax Office can cut off the water for one taxpayer and cut off the water for the entire alley. Furthermore, if the taxpayer holds shares in a certain company, the Tax Office can cut off the water and electricity to the entire company until it goes bankrupt because of the taxpayer's donation. If their powers are expanded to this extent, isn't it shocking? The Tax Office knows that the taxpayer is a lawyer, and yet they treat him like this. The oppression suffered by other non-legal citizens can be imagined. If they do such a small amount in this way, then other large amounts can be imagined. Taxpayers have never been stingy with the money they should pay. This time, knowing that the telephone line was cut off, they felt extremely lost, and the amount of donation was very small. However, in order to maintain the legal interests of all taxpayers in the concession, it is difficult to allow them to set this bad precedent. Since the Tax Office arbitrarily takes floating amounts from taxpayers and does not hesitate to take extra-legal actions to infringe on their rights, taxpayers will naturally not give up the slightest bit and will not correct it. Therefore, I am writing this letter specifically to request your association to forward a letter to the Municipal Council, notifying the Telephone Company to restore the telephone immediately and compensate for all losses caused by the disconnection.' The association believes that the date of rental should be based on material evidence, and if not, a lawsuit should be filed in court for trial. It is not permissible to collect floating amounts. Even if they do not collect floating amounts, it is not permissible to order the Telephone Company to stop its use of the telephone. The clumsiness of the method is not what our taxpayers' commissioned agency should do. Furthermore, it is understood that the household of a certain nationality owes the most in donations. Why not use this illegal method to force them to pay on time? We ask your bureau to immediately correct this error and not take extra-legal actions again."</p>
<p>Hand-to-Hand Combat Was Quite Fierce</p>
<h3>German Dies Strangely, Says Before Death That Someone Used Hypnosis to Make Him Swallow Poison, But There Is No Evidence - Court Orders Forensic Doctor to Perform Autopsy</h3>
<p>A German named Lu Huigelanman Ying (transliteration), 52 years old, previously opened a shop in Tianjin. Later, due to business failure, he came to Shanghai in a mess and now lives in Room 13, Yifa Hotel, No. 82 Kade Road. At 7:00 AM the day before yesterday, the waiter, Jiang Chengqing, discovered that he was in hand-to-hand combat and saw that he was suffering from a serious illness. Jiang was extremely frightened and immediately informed a Westerner in Room 7 of the hotel. After he was sent to the Public Concession Hospital for treatment, it was ineffective. He died at 11:00 PM. The hospital reported to the Xinzha Police Station, which dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. Then, the body was taken to the Feilun Road Morgue. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court was reported, and Inspector Guo Wei, Forensic Doctor Zhang Yan, and Clerk Wang Zuyi were appointed to inspect the body. Then, the Western Police Chief reported that the Public Concession Hospital had reported to them yesterday that the deceased had died from poisoning, and it was said that the deceased had said in the hospital that two other Westerners had come to his place last night and used hypnosis to make him swallow the poison, but there was no sufficient evidence, etc. Jiang Chengqing also testified that he had been working as a waiter in the hotel for a month. Yesterday morning at 7:00 AM, he sent breakfast to the Westerner's room and suddenly saw him groaning in bed. When he looked closer, he grasped his hand tightly and saw a faint sound coming from his mouth, and he felt that his hands and feet were in fierce hand-to-hand combat. He was extremely frightened and immediately went to Room 7 to inform another Westerner of the situation, but he had been in the hotel for more than a month and had not seen another Westerner visit the deceased's room, etc. Mr. Guo received the confession and, in order to understand the truth, ordered the forensic doctor to perform an autopsy on the body and reschedule the hearing for next Monday.</p>
<h3>The Annual Bathing Buddha Festival Is Lively in Front of Jing'an Temple; Christians Also Go to Proclaim Jesus</h3>
<p>The eighth day of the fourth lunar month, also known as the Bathing Buddha Festival, was celebrated in front of Jing'an Temple as usual. Since the first day, vendors have gathered on both sides of Shangma Road, setting up tents and opening factories to earn a small profit. The incense in Jing'an Temple was especially crowded. Yesterday was the sixth day, and tourists were shoulder to shoulder. From Hadong Road in the east to Difeng Road in the west, and from Fuxu Road in the south to Aivenyi Road in the north, stretching for more than a mile, the stalls were lined up, forming a grand spectacle. The authorities took precautions against petty thieves, with guards stationed every ten steps, and security was strict. It was especially commendable for the Indian patrols to ride back and forth in the crowd and in the scorching sun. The incense in Jing'an Temple was swirling, and even before the festival, pilgrims were constantly coming and going. Once inside the main hall, it was like being in a five-mile fog. The temporary National Goods Market was west of Jing'an Temple Tram Station, and merchants erected two arches. The shops in the market have all opened. What is most striking is that the Bathing Buddha Festival is a Buddhist memorial day, but Christians, in order to break Buddhist superstition, also vigorously proclaimed their religious doctrine. The Moore Church in this city actually has an organization of Christian preachers, holding small flags and distributing leaflets among the crowd. Even some illiterate Buddhist believers were carrying Christian leaflets in their hands while worshiping on futons, which was truly an interesting sight.</p>
<h3>Provisional Regulations for Punishing Bandits Extended for Another Six Months</h3>
<p>The effective period of the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Bandits was originally until May 17th. Yesterday, the Garrison Headquarters and the Municipal Government received an order from the National Government stating that the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Bandits would be extended for another six months from the 18th of this month.</p>
<h3>Procedures for Reissuing Real Estate Registration Certificates</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Local Court received an order from the Jiangsu High Court yesterday, stating: "The Ministry of Administration ordered that the current laws and regulations do not specify the procedures for reissuing real estate registration certificates. The measures determined by the Ministry's Order No. 17474 of 1932 are still inadequate for protecting the interests of right holders and third parties. It is necessary to revise appropriate measures to ensure proper handling. In the future, if a right holder applies for a new certificate due to the loss or destruction of the registration certificate, and can prove the reason for the loss or destruction, the registration agency shall reissue it with the date, number, and reason for the loss or destruction of the original certificate. As for the collection of fees, the provisions of Article 135 of the Real Estate Registration Regulations shall be applied. If the applicant cannot prove the reason for the loss or destruction, he shall be allowed to follow Article 42 of the same regulations and the implementing rules of the same regulations and order him to attach a guarantee. You are hereby ordered to inform your subordinates to comply accordingly.</p>
<p>A Tragedy That Occurred Four Years Ago in Shaoxing</p>
<h3>Mother Conspires with Lover to Chop Up Her Own Son, Cutting Him Twenty-Seven Times, Cutting Off His Head, and Throwing His Body into the River; The Main Culprit, Shen Jinchang, Comes to Shanghai and Attempts to Kill the Deceased's Brother - Zhang Zonghan Searches Everywhere for the Murderer and Catches Him in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Shen Jinchang from Shaoxing, 39 years old, lives at No. 88 Fuxingli, Bailinan Road. On May 16, 1929, in Shaoxing, he colluded with Hu Mianzhi, Wang Yueming, Li Bao, and others to chop up a man named Zhang Aniao with a knife twenty-seven times. Then, he cut off Zhang's head and threw his body into the Han Yachi River, fleeing without a trace. Later, the local police station arrested Hu and Wang and handed them over to the court. Because Shen was not captured, it was difficult to make a final decision. Each was released on bail for three thousand yuan. There was</p>
<h3>The Deceased's Brother</h3>
<p>Zhang Zonghan, currently works as a backstage manager at the Yue Opera Theater in the Far East Hotel. He recently heard that Shen had come to Shanghai and planned to assassinate him. Zhang then searched everywhere for Shen's whereabouts. Until the morning before yesterday, he met Shen at the Deyuan Teahouse on Fujian Road. When Shen saw Zhang coming, he ran away. Zhang followed closely in pursuit. At the Beijing Road intersection, Chinese detective Bu Zongting and Chinese policeman No. 2414 arrested Shen and took him back to the Lao Zha Police Station. Under investigation, Shen confessed in detail the reason and process for killing Zhang Aniao. The reason was that the deceased Zhang Aniao's mother, Chen, had an affair with Hu Mianzhi. Because the matter was not kept secret, the deceased found out, and the deceased once</p>
<h3>Caught Them in the Act of Adultery</h3>
<p>Chen felt ashamed and was deeply afraid that her husband would find out in Shanghai, which would be difficult to bear. She then decided to kill her son and secretly discussed the plan with Hu Mianzhi. Hu invited Shen Jinchang and the deceased's sister-in-law Wang Lianzhu (Zhang Zonghan's wife before marrying Zhang, she was having an affair with Shen) to discuss the matter at No. 3 Daoyu Qian. As a result of the discussion, Shen invited Wang Yueming and Li Bao. On May 16, they carried out the murder of Zhang Aniao, dismembered the body, and discarded it in the river. Chen then went with Hu Mianzhi, Wang Lianzhu, and Shen Jinchang</p>
<h3>Fled to Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Hu gave Shen one hundred yuan and instructed Shen to flee elsewhere. Shi Fangmian, Zhi, and Wang Yueming were arrested by the government. Shen, however, relied on certain forces and ultimately escaped the law. However, because Zhang Zonghan was investigating Shen very closely, Shen thought that if he did not remove Zonghan, he would never have a chance to get ahead. He then came to Shanghai and bribed someone to harm him. Unexpectedly, the person was a close friend of Zhang Zonghan and notified Zhang, asking him to be careful. Zhang therefore learned</p>
<h3>Shen's Whereabouts</h3>
<p>And arrested him. The detectives then took Shen into custody and escorted him to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Police station lawyer Li Zhishan stated the case and said that he had heard that the Shaoxing Court had previously sent an official letter to your court wanting to arrest the defendant. Therefore, this case requests a postponement of one week so that the Shaoxing Court can be notified to send personnel to escort him. When questioned, Shen Jinchang confessed that the people who had discussed it in advance, namely, Yue Ming and Li Bao, were indeed hired by him, but he was not present when the killing was carried out. Chief Qian Hongye of the Criminal Court verified the confession and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing for one week.</p>

<h3>Woman Sacrifices Her Life for a Fashionable New Dress</h3>
<p>Xu Ruiqing, a native of Anhui with the address 112 Old Granary Street in the city, is 33 years old and deals in yarn belts. His wife, née Zhu, is 27 years old and was raised as a child bride before marrying him. Therefore, she has no relatives in Shanghai. Recently, Zhu wanted to make a new dress for a banquet. Xu had already had it made the other day, but the style and size were outdated. She was very angry and immediately urged Xu to exchange it. The couple then had an argument, and she cried incessantly. Xu then took the dress and went out, promising to exchange it. However, she couldn't get over her resentment and bought a large amount of opium from a nearby Swallow's Nest after her husband left and committed suicide. When her husband returned home and learned of the situation, he immediately sent her to the New Gate Red Cross Hospital for treatment. However, the time for treatment had passed, and there was no way to revive her. She was then carried back home and reported to the first precinct of the second district. Yesterday, the local headman Jiang Pingyang was ordered to report to the local court for an inquest.</p>

<h3>Texaco Suddenly Reduces Oil Prices After the Three-Nation Oil Price Agreement; The Three Companies Will Jointly Counter, Or There Will Be Another Fierce Competition</h3>
<p>China's kerosene market has always been dominated by the United Kingdom and the United States. Since Russian oil actively entered China and was dumped on the market, the situation became a three-way split. They competed with each other by lowering prices, resulting in significant losses. Last year, after negotiations, they unanimously announced a truce and simultaneously raised prices to recover previous losses. Recently, Texaco Oil Company of the United States suddenly broke the agreement and drastically lowered oil prices. The United Kingdom and Russia will plan to respond, or there will be another round of competition. The details are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3>Texaco Oil Suddenly Reduces Prices</h3>
<p>According to sources in the kerosene industry, the current kerosene market in China is controlled by four major oil companies: Mobil and Texaco of the United States, Asiatic Petroleum of the United Kingdom, and Guanghua of Russia. In May of last year, in order to maintain oil prices in China, the four companies agreed not to freely change oil prices. However, Texaco of the United States has recently separated from Mobil and is operating independently. Therefore, it is actively promoting the sale of excess inventory at reduced prices. Currently, the selling prices of kerosene for Asiatic, Mobil, and Guanghua are 7.2 yuan per ten gallons, while Texaco has reduced it to 6 yuan, a difference of 1.2 yuan. The original agreement has been broken.</p>
<h3>The Three Companies Will Jointly Counter</h3>
<p>Since Texaco Company of the United States suddenly reduced prices, the business of the remaining three companies, such as Asiatic, Guanghua, and Mobil, has been significantly affected. However, in order to comply with the agreement, they are temporarily selling at the original prices and will hold a meeting to discuss countermeasures. However, it is heard that if there is no result, they may jointly reduce prices and engage in fierce competition again.</p>
<h3>Mobil Actively Purchases Russian Oil</h3>
<p>Mobil Oil Company of the United States has a long history in China and a wide market. Recently, as oil sales have increased daily, the original oil production has been insufficient to meet the demand. Yesterday, it specifically purchased 500,000 barrels of Russian oil from Russia's "Oil Everywhere" to distribute in the Chinese market. It is said that this is the first transaction, and it is planned to continue purchasing from Russia if necessary in the future.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Province Increases Taxes, Affecting Guangshe</h3>
<p>Sichuan Province has recently increased kerosene tax rates to supplement its finances, which are in deficit, its financial situation, which is stagnant, and its military expenses, which are in dire need of funds. The tax rate has been increased from two yuan to two yuan and eight jiao per ten gallons. As a result, the operations of various oil companies have been significantly affected. In addition to Asiatic Petroleum Company having submitted a request to the tax authorities to revise the tax, the four companies are now planning to jointly submit a request to the Ministry of Finance, asking them to instruct the Sichuan provincial authorities to stop the tax increase.</p>
<h3>Qingyang Port Railway Hotel Scheduled to Open; The Scenery of Water and Sky is Beautiful; Qing Kun Yacht Tours Will Be Held Simultaneously</h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus, recognizing the beautiful scenery of Qingyang Port Station and the large number of tourists, but lacking a place to stay, established a railway hotel in the area. It is now scheduled to open on May 23. That afternoon, the Railway Bureau will host a visit for all parties. The construction situation of the hotel is recorded below.</p>
<h3>Complete Arrangement</h3>
<p>The Railway Hotel is located on the riverside of Qingyang Port, with a large area. It was originally the Jiang family's garden villa, which the Railway Bureau rented for 200 yuan per month, for a period of five years, starting from next month. The building consists of 30 rooms, large and small, all located deep in the forest, with green shade covering the windows, water and sky in one color, and sails fluttering and bridge shadows and gulls flying, which are good embellishments for the hotel.</p>
<h3>Treat Guests</h3>
<p>The hotel will hold its opening ceremony on the morning of the 23rd of this month. In order to attract business, the Railway Bureau will host a tour for all sectors of society on the morning of that day to visit the equipment and arrangements of the hotel. At that time, on the Shanghai-Kunshan road, the shadows of hairpins and the fragrance of clothes will be abundant, and its grandeur can be predicted.</p>
<h3>Will Open Yacht</h3>
<p>After the completion of the Qingyang Port Hotel, the place is very close to Kunshan, and the scenery along the waterway is particularly beautiful. Therefore, the Railway Bureau plans to hold Qing Kun yacht tours again, so that tourists to Qingyang Port can visit Kunshan on the way. The yacht fares are very cheap, and the equipment in the yacht is exquisite, which is enough to make tourists feel happy.</p>
<h3>The Grand Occasion of the Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition at the Nanshi National Products Market</h3>
<p>Since the Nanshi National Products Market, sponsored by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, held a calligraphy and painting exhibition on the 15th, five to six hundred people have visited it every day. The market has now collected a variety of ancient celebrity calligraphy and paintings, such as those by Tang Bohu, Ma Hansan, and Shen Shitian, which are truly rare treasures. Modern calligraphy and painting masters such as Xie Xian'ou, Luo Bohua, Peng Taonian, Sun Weiju, Lu Shaopo, and Wang Shengyuan's landscapes; Yu Jifan, Zhu Liangcai, Li Fangyuan, and Lu Bolong's figures; Wu Tieshan and Hong Songjiong's pine, stone, and orchid, and couplets; and Liu Haisu, Ma Qizhou, Zhang Yuguang, Xiong Songquan, Cheng Liushen, and Zhu Qishi's flowers, birds, and beasts are all fine works. Moreover, most of them are voluntary donations, and the prices are particularly low. Even those who are not donating are willing to sell them at half price. All proceeds from sales will be used to promote the use of national products.</p>

<h3>Recent News from the Shenbao Circulating Library: Contributions to Readers in Other Cities; New Work of the Reading Guidance Department</h3>
<p>The Shenbao Circulating Library (3rd floor of the Mainland Department Store on Nanjing Road, Shanghai), founded by this newspaper, has only been established for over a year, but its achievements are considerable. The number of readers in this city has exceeded 7,000, and the average number of books borrowed daily is over 1,000. It also has a postal borrowing department to facilitate readers from afar who are unable to come to the library. However, it is only limited to this city. Recently, the library, in view of the enthusiastic demand from people in other cities to borrow books, has specially formulated regulations to meet this need. Circulation to other cities is only in the trial period for the time being, and there are some restrictions on the scope of circulation. The scope of restrictions is as follows: (1) Readers who have left Shanghai, that is, those who were originally readers of the library and continue to borrow books because they have been transferred to other cities for work; (2)</p>
<p>Those who participate in the library's Reading Guidance Department. The library's Reading Guidance Department was only established this year and specializes in guiding people who are interested in studying various subjects. Since the daily publication of "Reading Questions and Answers" in this newspaper, it has only been a few months, but it has been able to attract the attention of young people in general. The first collection of Reading Questions and Answers has been published on May 5, totaling more than 100,000 words, and is only sold for 3 jiao. The first type of self-study series in the process of editing, "How to Self-Study Social Sciences," will also be published on the 21st of this month. The method of joining the department is also very simple. Any reader of this newspaper who is interested in studying and making progress can write to request to join. After communicating with the department once or twice, if they are considered sincere, the department will fill out an "Introduction Card" to the postal borrowing department, and the postal borrowing department will notify the reader to borrow books according to the regulations. Those who want to request the regulations can directly write to the library.</p>
<h3>The Competition for Domestic Pickled Vegetables: Domestic Products Have Almost No Footing; I Hope All Sectors Will Unanimously Adopt Them</h3>
<p>Pickled vegetables are produced in various coastal provinces of Fujian and Zhejiang in our country. In the past, they were only used as a side dish for summer vegetables and a cold drink for families to relieve the heat. Later, the demand gradually increased, and the output could not meet the demand. Japanese goods then took advantage of the situation</p>
<p>and entered the market. The annual import value is about 6 million yuan. The guests became the host, and domestic products were forced to disappear. Since the September 18th Northeast Incident, the Chinese people were motivated by righteous indignation and unanimously used boycotts as a backing. Japanese pickled vegetables disappeared for a time. However, it is not a long-term plan to give up eating because of choking. Ningbo Rusheng Canned Food Factory spent a lot of money to set up a factory and carefully improved the product, and succeeded. The products are excellent, and their quality and color are no different from Japanese goods. At that time, anti-Japanese associations in various places suspected that they were Japanese goods repackaged, and they were detained from time to time. Later, the Shanghai Biscuit, Candy, and Canned Food Industry Association issued a certificate and published an announcement in the newspaper, and the public's doubts were dispelled. They congratulated each other and saw a good sale for a while. Unexpectedly, recently, Japanese merchants have used dumping policies and imported a large amount again. The original price of 7 to 8 yuan per catty has been reduced to 2 to 3 yuan. The products of Rusheng Factory have been squeezed out of</p>
<p>no place to stand. There are also Nanhua stores that are blinded by profit, posing as domestic goods and deceiving customers. It is found that the largest demand for pickled vegetables is from restaurants and confectionery factories. It is now heard that Rusheng Factory, in order to implement its original intention, regardless of cost, has reduced the price to 2 yuan and 1 jiao per catty to make a desperate fight.</p>
<h3>Silver Shops in the French Concession Oppose the Classified Business Tax; Send a Letter to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association for Assistance</h3>
<p>All silver shops, large and small, in the French Concession have received notices from the French Municipal Council requiring them to pay the silver shop classified business health tax for days in a row. Because the industry has already paid the silver shop tax before, they expressed opposition to the classified business tax. In addition to reporting to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession and asking them to negotiate with the French authorities to abolish the tax, the industry also jointly signed and sealed a letter to the French Municipal Council, asking them to consider the difficulties of the merchants and abolish it. The reason is that the silver shop tax already includes gold, stone, jade, antiques, etc., and its nature is equivalent to the classified business tax, so there is no need to pay other miscellaneous taxes. Moreover, it was also allowed by the French authorities when resolving the silver shop tax that no other miscellaneous taxes would be charged, etc. Now, suddenly introducing a classified business tax is really piling on top of each other and there is no reason at all. Therefore, they expressed their firm opposition.</p>
<h3>Chinese and Foreign Grocery Association Implements Industry Rules</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Grocery Association, located on Milu Road in this city, has specially formulated industry rules in order to strive to increase the common interests of the industry. After the amendments of the second members' representative assembly, it was submitted to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for approval with the reference number She Zi 16381. It was approved and filed, and it was transferred to the Municipal Government, and letters were sent to the Municipal Party Department, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and various courts, and it was published in the Municipal Gazette. In addition to being submitted to the 15th Executive Committee Meeting for approval, it will be published in major local newspapers in turn from today to announce the implementation, and the industry rules will be printed and distributed to all members of the industry for reference and compliance.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Female Guest at the Yong'an Hotel Commits Suicide by Poison; The Chen-Surnamed Guest Never Came; The Reason for the Suicide is Unclear</h3>
<p>At 11:30 on the night of the 16th, a single female guest, speaking in a Cantonese accent, came to the Yong'an Hotel at No. 85 Fuxingli, Lao Yong'an Street, outside the New North Gate of the French Concession. She did not have any luggage. She claimed to be Zheng Alian, 23 years old, a native of Guangdong, and a businesswoman. She needed to stay overnight. The waiter led her to the third floor and opened room 27. The female guest paid 8 jiao and 1 fen for one night's room fee and turned around and went out. She told the waiter that if a Chen-surnamed guest came to visit, please ask him to wait in the room for a while, and she would be back soon. At 1:30 in the morning, the female guest returned to the hotel. After the waiter sent her a bowl of water, she closed the door and went to sleep. It is not known what caused her to be so stimulated that she took her own life by poison that night. It was not until about 9 o'clock the next morning that the waiter heard groaning sounds from inside the room. He went into the room to check and saw the female guest lying on the bed, her face pale, and her breath like a gossamer. He also found two small opium smoking boxes on the bed. Only then did he know that she had taken poison. The waiter Liu Youhua immediately informed the accounting room and reported to the French Concession police station. She was sent to Renji Hospital by car. Because she had been poisoned too deeply, she died before reaching the hospital.</p>
<p>She was then transferred to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for an autopsy. No family members were found. Yesterday, the police station reported to the Second Special District Local Court. Chief Prosecutor Chen Bei, accompanied by a forensic medical recorder, arrived at the location to verify that the deceased had indeed committed suicide by taking poison. He ordered the body to be handed over to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall for photos and burial, pending identification by relatives. The deceased was of medium build, wearing a blue striped cloth short shirt, white western cloth short trousers, a plaid flannel cheongsam, flesh-colored new silk stockings, and black shoes. However, the Chen-surnamed guest that the deceased told the hotel waiter about has not been seen at the hotel until now, and there is no way to investigate. The cause of the deceased's suicide is</p>
<h3>The Jianghua Wheel Seizes a Large Number of Gold Bars</h3>
<p>Customs inspections of smuggled goods have been very strict recently, and inspections of imported ships have been particularly thorough. This time, the Jianghua Wheel of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company came to Shanghai from the Yangtze River. When the ship arrived at the Jinliyuan Wharf in Nanzha, passengers disembarked and were inspected as usual to prevent the smuggling of prohibited items. At that time, the wharf inspector seized 20 gold bars smuggled from Hankou to Shanghai in a passenger's luggage, worth more than 20,000 yuan. They were immediately detained on the spot. Because they evaded customs duties and did not hand them over to the shipping company for transportation, the wharf inspector handed over the seized large number of 20 gold bars to the Jianghai Customs for collection. It is said that the person carrying these gold bars was from the silver shop industry, greedy for small profits, and took great risks, to such an extent. Now, the customs must collect customs duties on these gold bars, and the silver shop that entrusted the carrier must submit a formal report to the customs before they are allowed to pay the taxes and receive them.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau Reclaims Ownerless Porcelain and Rowing Boat</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau sent a letter to this newspaper yesterday, stating that, according to a report from the Water Patrol Team of the Bureau, on the morning of the 13th of this month at 3 o'clock, police officers Jiang Bin, Wu Minshen, Wang Xingqi, etc., reported that they saw three or four people walking back and forth on a raft near Kaitai Wharf, looking very suspicious. They sailed closer to investigate, and the people immediately went ashore and fled. The police officers checked the raft and found many pieces of porcelain, all covered with straw, and a rowing boat next to it. There was also porcelain in the cabin. They asked about the owner, but no one came. The porcelain rowing boat was brought to the team for verification, etc. Upon inspection, 45 pieces of porcelain were counted. It was found that this batch of ownerless porcelain must be stolen goods, but no one reported the loss. It is inconvenient to store them in this team for a long time. In addition to ordering the detectives to investigate the truth of the case and strictly arrest the fugitives, a separate document will be submitted for approval. The seized porcelain rowing boat will be sent to your bureau for verification." A total of 45 pieces of ownerless porcelain and one rowing boat were sent (kept in the team pending instructions). In view of this, in addition to announcing and sending separate letters ordering the investigation and claiming, we hereby send a letter for verification. Please publish them in the newspapers so that the owner can come to the bureau to identify and claim them. Sincerely, Wen Hongen, Director of the Shenbao Newspaper Office,</p>

<h3>Film</h3>
<p>"Good Night" Premieres Today: Lianhua's Epic "Good Night" uses a chastity arch as its theme, vigorously criticizing the hypocrisy of honoring chastity. The film depicts a mother who, under the glory of the chastity arch, faithfully guards her widowhood for more than ten years, only to die beneath the arch. This kind of experience can truly be described as tragic and heartbreaking. However, this is merely a backdrop. The film's heroine becomes a widow in her youth, guarding her empty boudoir and lamenting her fate. She inadvertently encounters a young man, and the seeds of love are quickly sown, but she is constrained by the shackles of morality and dares not express her love. Nevertheless, rumors spread, and public opinion condemns her. Ultimately, she becomes the target of ridicule and abuse, bearing more suffering than the chastity mother. Tan Ying plays the heroine, fully expressing the young widow's deep sorrow. Jiang Junchao and Tang Tianxi are also highly experienced actors. The film is directed by Yang Xiaozhong, with a script by Zhu Shilin. It premieres today at the Jincheng Grand Theatre.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor: We were deeply surprised to read in the local news section of your newspaper on the 18th of this month an article claiming that Zhu Zaizhong, a native of Jiading, aged 30, who used to work at the Guohua Coal Briquette Factory on Father Jin Road in Shanghai, committed suicide by overdosing on tranquilizers in room 326 of the Greater Shanghai Hotel yesterday afternoon. Upon investigation, we found that no such person as Zhu Zaizhong is employed at our factory. We believe this is based on inaccurate rumors and was published in error. We are writing to request that your newspaper publish a correction to avoid confusion. Thank you. Sincerely, Guohua Coal Briquette Factory, May 18th.</p>
<p>Having read in your newspaper's news section about Le Jia bringing a altered passbook to your company, please note that the manager of our bank is not Mr. Zhu Xuefan. We would appreciate it if you would correct this. Sincerely, Shanghai China Industrial Bank Fuxu Road Branch, May 18th.</p>
<p>Reading Q &amp; A</p>
<h3>Discussion on Several Basic Questions in Philosophy (4)</h3>
<p>Today, we will further discuss Mr. Sheng Jifu's questions "4" and "5," as they are closely related to the previous three days.</p>
<p>The editor hopes that readers will review the entire text.</p>
<p>Editor</p>
<p>Four: "Is the unity of subject and object in the process of social practice?"</p>
<p>Having understood the above explanation, a positive answer can be obtained to this question. Because society is full of contradictions, changes, and development - movement (this is social practice) - human understanding emerges from the process of social practice.</p>
<p>For example, warlords, corrupt officials, and bureaucrats set up countless checkpoints, collecting various exorbitant taxes and levies, which hindered the flow of goods and raised their prices. Externally, they could not compete with cheap and exquisite foreign goods; internally, they reduced the purchasing power of the masses. As a result, production suffered a great blow (with workers and farmers bearing the brunt), and the national economy declined. Therefore, whether it is production and construction or rural revitalization, the first step must be to abolish exorbitant taxes and levies before the topic can be discussed. If this is not done, then construction and revitalization will only benefit those who set up checkpoints, enriching their pockets, and will be meaningless for production and the economy.</p>
<p>The objective reality is the recognition of the reality of exorbitant taxes, production stagnation, economic decline, etc. The subject is the recognition of these real changes, movements, and their inevitability, leading to the abolition of exorbitant taxes and the revitalization of the economy.</p>
<p>The harmony, agreement, and coordination between the subject and object - the word "unity" is more difficult to understand, so these words are used instead - is indeed manifested in the process of practice, from exorbitant taxes leading to hindered flow of goods, small markets, and the inability to expand production, but rather shrinking and stagnating. If we further investigate, after the abolition of exorbitant taxes (in the narrow sense), the price of goods will be reduced by the amount of taxes, the purchasing power of the masses will increase, and as a result, production will accelerate, and industry, agriculture, and commerce will all be active, and the economy will prosper. Isn't this a natural occurrence?</p>
<p>Seven: "Why is the essence of humanity not the physical body?"</p>
<p>However, readers must also understand that human understanding is not a static and unchanging thing. (This has been adequately explained in the third question.) Because of the changes in the objective world, human understanding also changes accordingly.</p>
<p>In the early years of the Republic of China, up to and around the May Fourth Movement, the movement for equal rights for men and women and women's participation in politics was very fashionable, and later it was replaced by cutting off queues, foot binding, and free love. More recently, free love is no longer a glamorous and touching term, and the women's liberation movement is no longer presented as a problem that can be solved in isolation. These are all due to changes in objective reality. Looking at the democratic republican movement in Western Europe, it was such a dazzling treasure in the nineteenth century, and so many people sacrificed and shed blood for it. Now, it has become tattered and worn. To give a more recent example, a few years ago, "production rationalization" was considered by the world to be the savior of the decline of capitalism, and now, controlled economies are considered to be gods. This only illustrates that changes in the objective environment affect changes in human thought. If human understanding were unchanging, then would Dai Jitao ten years ago and Dai Chuanxian now not be two completely different people? The former was a revolutionary advocating materialism, while the latter is a Buddhist monk chanting scriptures. Therefore, it is wrong to recognize the essence of humanity only through the five senses and the physical body. It is full of social and historical character. That is, human understanding is also in a constant process of change. Isn't the metabolism of human cells common knowledge?</p>
<p>However, pigs, dogs, cows, horses, in short, whether animals or plants, only have their concrete physical bodies and branches. Although there are various changes, they are only changes in the shape of the physical body. The difference between humans and animals lies in the fact that the essence of humanity is not only the concrete form of the physical body. Therefore, Feuerbach's view that the essence of humanity is the physical body is wrong.</p>
<p>If readers still find the above answers unclear, it is hoped that you will study more about what a socialist society is and how the absoluteness and relativity of contradictions are manifested.</p>
<p>Epilogue</p>
<p>Philosophy is originally a relatively abstract science, especially the part of epistemology is more difficult to understand (in fact, philosophy is nothing more than the unity of epistemology and methodology). Therefore, in order to find the correct path in human life, one must obtain correct epistemology and method. We should study it as a "life mirror" and comprehend it from practice. To be honest, it is impossible to understand dialectics without practice.</p>
<p>Our research on philosophy is extremely superficial. However, readers have already raised questions, so we have no choice but to answer the readers sincerely to the best of our understanding. It is inevitable that some parts are not fully explained or are unsatisfactory. If readers see this, we still hope to be able to point them out, but we ask ourselves that we are extremely cautious in explaining problems, the writing is striving for simplicity and clarity, and the examples are also used as much as possible with popular or well-known things. It is precisely for this reason that perhaps each lively concept cannot be fully clarified. In short, readers will definitely be able to obtain a correct understanding by carefully studying from actual movement and actual life. (End)</p>
<p>Chunqiu</p>
<h3>The Misty Record of Imperial Incense</h3>
<p>—Original by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Now let us write some more about the Empress Dowager's "Luan Yu" (Phoenix Carriage). In fact, the word "Luan Yu" is just a customary term. That thing is not a "carriage" at all; it is just a rattan sedan chair.</p>
<p>Whether in that team of ceremonial guards or in that grand ceremony, this rattan sedan chair always occupied an extremely important position. Because it seems to be the home of the Empress Dowager, even when the Empress Dowager herself is not sitting in this rattan sedan chair, all the ministers must respectfully kowtow to it. — This is also a custom passed down from the emperors and empresses of previous dynasties. As long as it belongs to or is used by the emperor or empress dowager, the ministers must pay their respects and must not desecrate it.</p>
<p>Just for this Luan Yu, another car was specially prepared to carry it. This Luan Yu not only has a special car, but also a specially made wooden frame to support it so that it does not touch the wooden board underneath; — that is, the floor of the car — because these floors have been trampled on by ordinary people, and of course they can no longer contaminate the Empress Dowager's Luan Yu. On the road from Beiping to Fengtian, the Empress Dowager still needed to use it many times. Each time it was used, the entire train had to stop, and the wooden board that she used when she got on the train was first placed at the door of the car where the Empress Dowager was sitting, and then a plank-like thing was erected between this wooden board and the Luan Yu. Of course, both wooden boards were padded with thick velvet, so that the Empress Dowager could walk on it as comfortably as walking on cotton wool.</p>
<p>If you ask about the appearance and decoration of this Luan Yu, it is really brilliant! Such a beautiful sedan chair is indeed worthy of a special car to carry it!</p>
<p>Because it is too luxurious and too beautiful, I really don't know how to describe it appropriately! (37)</p>
<h3>In May</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>Sugared plums are on the market, croakers are on the market, take off cotton robes and put on jackets, young masters play "golf," rickshaw pullers untie their belts and wipe their sweat, white clouds float in the sky, the air is a bit stuffy, open the window and sigh - "This unlucky May!" May, the season I fear the most, this month is used to hauntings, this month will make good people sick. Those who have suffered from rheumatism have to have an attack when they enter the solar term of May, and those who are "born deficient" and "malnourished" can't stand it even more. The leg joints, arms, back, ...... all have a faint ache. With hemiplegia, watching other people look energetic, secretly thinking, how sad!</p>
<p>There is pain, please Langzhong, please Langzhong to take medicine, this is "a matter of course," sick people will never "fortunately not take medicine," otherwise, Langzhong starve to death, the pharmacy close, it is inevitable, but my wife is against Langzhong, today in front of the City God Bodhisattva kowtow seventy-seven forty-nine loud heads, ask for a package of incense ash, force me to swallow with shochu, tomorrow Lu Chunyang there draw a spirit talisman, call me to burn the ashes and swallow, I really have no way, bitterly plead: "Wife, please ask a Langzhong, Bodhisattva?"</p>
<p>Can't rely on it?"</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, my wife got angry and said loudly: "Can Langzhong be relied on! Can you be sure which one is a good Langzhong? Some tell the truth and sell fake medicine, some rely on the old and sell the old, and can't even cure a cold, some are newly successful and desperately want money (consultation fee), Bodhisattva can't be relied on, why do people spend so much money to rush to XX to do a Taoist temple?"</p>
<p>I said: "Stop it, stop it! I only hope that May will pass quickly, and let the June sunshine kill those demons and ghosts, and take a breath of fresh air."</p>
<h3>Two Photos</h3>
<p>— Chifo</p>
<p>No wonder the ancients believed in the myth of "the old man under the moon tying feet with red silk." According to a friend's story about a love affair, it is really very interesting; let's write it out.</p>
<p>This was three or five years ago. There was a student named S in a jewelry store in Shanghai, who was sixteen years old, very handsome, gentle in character, and very diligent in his service; he usually went in and out of his teacher's home as if he were his own child. One day, the teacher's wife asked S to help her move. Among the messy things, S suddenly found a photo of a beauty, and was staring at it when the teacher's wife's daughter ran over in a hurry to snatch the photo. He said sharply: "This is a small photo of you taken the year before last; why do you want it!" As he spoke, he reached out to snatch it. S looked at the truth in the painting, and loved it so much that he couldn't bear to let go, and quickly stuffed it into his arms. She coquettishly begged for a while, and suddenly reached into S's pocket, originally wanting to snatch back her own photo, but unexpectedly took out his money bag, and saw that there was indeed a photo inside. Upon closer inspection, it turned out that it was not a small photo of herself, but a photo of S. Her delicate cheeks became even more red and white, and her heart couldn't help but feel a little surprised. She smiled charmingly: "If you don't return me, I won't return you either"; S "" also smiled; "Okay, let's keep them all!" They smiled and parted.</p>
<p>Half a year later, she moved to N Port. S first wrote a letter to ask about the teacher's wife's health, and also asked what school she was studying at, and was she about to graduate? Soon, he received her reply. At first, they just greeted each other and didn't say anything. Later, the writing became more and more close, and more and more good; the two sides were as drunk and infatuated, and they worked hard on writing letters every day. This matter was slightly heard by the teacher, so he dismissed S. When she heard this news, she cried loudly, and cut her hair in one fell swoop, and cried and cried, wanting to go to the nunnery. The teacher's wife had no choice but to send someone to hint to S, and asked someone to be a matchmaker, and the lovers finally got married.</p>
<h3>Night of Wind and Rain</h3>
<p>— Li Min</p>
<p>The clock has struck two o'clock at midnight!</p>
<p>The misty roofs of the Third Company are like paintings in the daytime, and the electric lights have long been extinguished. The bustling Risheng Building is as gloomy as a ghost town.</p>
<p>Under the storm, the streets are muddy. Except for the four-wheeled class of people, who are with their sweet wives and lovers, they pass through the entrances of Dongya, Datong, Xin Xin and other hotels, enter the door, go upstairs to realize his and her dreams, and the drivers also obey the orders and drive back to their place to love their wives and wait for orders the next day.</p>
<p>The crazy wind is blowing, blowing, as if a fierce lion is roaring, shaking the tiles, and the greasy rain is falling, falling; the Risheng Building, which used to be crowded with pedestrians, is now as cool and quiet as a deserted place.</p>
<p>The Indian Asan on the night shift, standing on the street to resist the cold wind and rain, shivering and chattering his teeth, had to shrink his head and crouch. Fortunately, there is no curfew at this time! The red and green lights sighed to the sky, three o'clock, four o'clock ...... until dawn, they were all wanderers on the crossroads, and the voluntary female detectives in the police station.</p>
<h3>Northeast Fourth Company Commander</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 28: Coincidence and Shared Stage,痴情拾帕 (Chi Qing Shi Pa - Picking up a handkerchief out of infatuation),殷勤兩問疾 (Yin Qin Liang Wen Ji - Asking about the illness with diligence), Misunderstanding and Posting a Letter</p>
<p>Also leaning up to his face, he smiled and said: I complain that I shouldn't have been sick in the first month. How did this let my sister-in-law hear it? Will you come in and sit for a while? Mrs. Gan smiled and said: No need, it will be fine if you don't make a fuss in the future. Mrs. Gan said this, but she was hiding behind the window and didn't leave. At this time, Ji Zhi was in a fit of rage, so he was willing to let this matter pass. Then he sighed and said: I would rather people betray me. This sentence was the clearest thing Mrs. Gan heard, and she didn't say anything else, nodded and left. Ji Zhi was sitting in the house, feeling very bored, and read the letter sent by Guizhi from beginning to end again. He sneered to himself, pressed the envelope and letter paper with both hands, and in a short while, tore them into dozens of pieces, which fell all over the ground. This was not enough, he stomped on them with his feet a few times, and smiled: Goodbye, Mrs. Zhao! After saying that, he climbed onto the bed and lay down. His behavior was naturally a bit out of the ordinary, and the male and female servants in Ji Zhi's family also saw it. At lunchtime, Ji Zhi was lying in bed and didn't get up, and by the time dinner came, he felt a little hungry. And thinking that if he didn't go to eat, his elder brother and sister-in-law would suspect him, so he went to the hall to eat with his elder brother and sister-in-law. When Hou Zhi came in and out, his eyes were fixed on his face, and even when he sat down, he kept looking at him. Mrs. Gan, who was sitting opposite him, saw this and smiled and said: Hou Zhi, why are you always paying attention to your brother like this? Hou Zhi said: He is a person who has just recovered from his illness. I don't think his complexion is very good. I suspect that he has been ill again. Ji Zhi said: I'll go back to school tomorrow, so as not to get sick from being idle. Hou Zhi said: If your body is not very good, you should rest for a day or two more, why are you in such a hurry to leave? Mrs. Gan smiled and said: Let him go, he will inevitably be stimulated on Haitien Street. (388)</p>
<p>Small Recipe</p>
<h3>Bamboo Shoots</h3>
<p>— Xianxian</p>
<p>Bamboo shoots, in the late spring season, are all the rage in the Suzhou and Hangzhou areas. High-end dishes are indeed indispensable for bamboo shoots. In home-cooked meals, it seems that a few pieces of bamboo shoots must be added. Even on the oil tofu and vermicelli stalls set up at the factory gate and on the side of the road, three or five bamboo shoots must be floating in the mixed soup pot to add to the scenery. Fresh bamboo shoots are also called spring bamboo shoots. Is the growth of spring bamboo shoots ultimately for growing into bamboo poles, preparing to be used for making utensils in the future, and benefiting society? Or is it for reproduction and expansion of territory? Or is it to feast human lips? This account cannot be accounted for because the God who created all things cannot be found in this world. However, the taste of bamboo shoots is indeed delicious, so we might as well think that bamboo shoots grow to provide people with food.</p>
<p>Some people say that spring bamboo shoots are like girls. When they are young, they hide in the soil, just like girls who are not adults, they are not very noticeable. When the spring breeze blows on the earth, spring bamboo shoots are like girls who are just starting to understand love, and they emerge from the ground to attract people. But at that time, their hearts are pure and full, and they still contain a naive and simple state. After this period, they become more and more deeply involved in the world, and all they feel is the emptiness of beauty as they grow old. After this period, youth has passed, and the green leaves have grown into shade, and they can only prepare to resist the scorching sun and frost.</p>
<p>In this late spring weather, bamboo shoots are just like young ladies. — Their hearts are not only full, but also pure and flawless.</p>
<h3>Various Roses</h3>
<p>— Yan Qiao</p>
<p>These days, roses are on the market, red like the color of a virgin's cheeks, giving people unparalleled joy and intoxication. Its fragrance is also sweet, thick like it has been mixed with sugar. But its uses are even greater! We can't do without it in our daily lives, how do you say? Please see!</p>
<p>Roses in tea are very common. Putting one or two roses in ordinary tea leaves will make the tea leaves much better. Fresh ones are certainly the best, and even old dried roses, placed in an airtight box, will not lose their flavor. They are most suitable for black tea, but they are not bad in green tea either. Unlike bitter orange blossoms, which are only suitable for green tea and not black tea, showing the "harmony and compatibility" of roses. Roses in wine, shochu is the most intense and stimulating drink. If you put some roses in it, after a while, the roses' delicate colors will disappear, but the taste of the shochu will be much softer. It is also fragrant and sweet, and women can also taste some. It is clear that roses can soften shochu, which is in line with the principle of "gentleness can overcome strength."</p>
<p>In addition, there are rose dew, rose jam, rose candy, rose half-plums, etc., which require more complicated procedures. When roses are on the market, those candy stores have a special product that is probably not easy to get in other places. It is made of the best white sugar and fresh rose petals, made into extremely thin slices. It is fragrant and sweet in the mouth, much more elegant and quiet than those imported chewing gums. In terms of color, it really matches what the West Chamber says, "The more delicate the more red and white it looks." It is a pity that the weather is gradually becoming humid, and this kind of candy is not suitable for placing in lime tanks, so it is only bought for a dozen days, and then it is gone.</p>
<p>Since roses are so useful and lovely, why don't we grow them ourselves? It is strange to say that Suzhou flower servants carry rose trees to the streets to sell every year, but nineteen out of ten of those bought back to plant do not live. Because it needs to be divided and planted, and the old itself will not prosper in the next year, so it is called "leaving mother grass." Fortunately, the price is very cheap, only ten cents per flower on the first day it is on the market.</p>

<h3>Fu Baolu and Chen Baoqiu Win Second Place in Pole Vault and Shot Put; Japan's Tokuda Wins Two Track and Field Championships; Yang Xiuqiong Wins Women's Swimming Individual Championship; Our Basketball Team Loses to the Philippines, Volleyball Team Beats the Philippines</h3>
<p>In the Far East Games track and field events, after Wu Bixian's fourth place in the high jump earning one point for our country, yesterday Chen Baoqiu's 16-pound shot put of 12.80 meters and Fu Baolu's pole vault of 3.87 meters both won second place, adding six more points. This is the first substantial harvest for our country's athletics in seven years, and our country should celebrate this achievement. Chen Qisong's fourth place in the 50-meter freestyle is an even greater harvest for our country since the 5th Games in 1921 (our country has not scored in swimming individual events since the 5th Games). Although it is only one point, it is very precious. In the women's swimming open performance, our Ms. Yang Xiuqiong won the individual championship. Our athletes completely overwhelmed the Filipinas, which is truly an unexpected honor. In terms of ball games, our volleyball team showed a brief resurgence, defeating the Philippine team 3-2, slightly saving face. However, the championship has already been won by the Philippines. Our team's initial defeat to the Philippines and subsequent defeat to Japan can be attributed to overconfidence and underestimation of the enemy. In the first meeting between the Chinese and Philippine basketball teams, our team was ultimately defeated by the Philippine team 27-37, dashing our ambitions. The championship has thus become the Philippine team's prize. In the baseball game, although our country still lost to Japan 0-8, the improvement in technique is enough to be pleased with. The Japan-Philippines tennis final, due to wet ground, has been rescheduled for today. The swimming all-around will also conclude today. The Philippines-Japan baseball, Philippines-Netherlands soccer, and Philippines-Japan basketball games are all important events today. What is particularly noteworthy is the Executive Committee meeting at 10 a.m., where the amendment of the constitution and the admission of new members, including whether they must be approved by all members, will be the focus of the meeting, and this is also something we should not overlook.</p>
<h3>Fu Baolu Wins Second Place in Pole Vault</h3>
<p>Our Country's Bumper Harvest in Athletics</p>
<h3>Second Place in Shot Put and Pole Vault, Chen Baoqiu Second in Shot Put with 12.80 Meters, Fu Baolu Second in Pole Vault with 3.87 Meters, Japan Wins Track and Field Championship, Philippines Runner-Up</h3>

<h3>Final Battle: Victory Over the Philippines After a Bitter Five-Set Match - Tense Atmosphere, Comeback Victory - Line Judge Discovers Another Error</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Manila, 18th) Today, in an extremely tense atmosphere, our volleyball team defeated the Philippines in five sets. Although the championship was out of reach, they finally wiped away the shame of their previous defeat. The volleyball competition has now concluded, with our country in second place and Japan in third.</p>
<p>China (21-19, 18-21, 16-21, 21-17, 21-17, 21-19) Philippines</p>
<p>In the first set, the Philippines performed very steadily, but in the final set, control was lost, and our country achieved final victory. In the first set, our team used moderately pressured balls, hitting in all directions, because the Philippines' net front work was exceptionally good and difficult to overcome. In the first half of the set, our country led 11-9 and won the first set 21-19 by two points.</p>
<p>Second Set: Second Set error, our team lost this set, it's a pity. Once there was a mutual misunderstanding, a ball that could have easily gone over the net, and they just stared at each other without hitting it. In the first half, we led 11-10 by one point, but the result was an 18-21 defeat.</p>
<p>Third Set: In the third set, our team's coordination gradually fell apart, unable to take care of their positions, resulting in a 16-21 defeat. In this set, the referee made two incorrect calls, calling balls that were out as good.</p>
<p>Fourth Set: Fourth Set, the Philippine team displayed an extremely solid defense. Our team repeatedly attacked but had difficulty breaking through. The Philippines took the lead 11-9 in the first half, but our side persevered, catching up from 9-12 to a tie at 16-16. Then we rode the momentum and won 21-17.</p>
<p>Fifth Set: The fifth set was the most thrilling. The Philippine team took an early lead 6-4, but our Li Fushen scored nine consecutive points with powerful serves. In the first half, our country changed sides leading 11-8. In the second half, the difference between the two teams was that our country was always ahead by two points. Finally, with excellent technique and spiking, we won 21-19. The results of the volleyball championship are as follows:</p>
<p>Country | Matches | Wins | Losses | Percentage</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>Philippines | 4 | 3 | 1 | 75%</p>

<h3>Rifle Competition: Our Individual Competitors Fail to Qualify</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Manila, 18th) In the individual rifle competition held on the morning of the 18th, with more than 30 participants, our athletes failed to qualify.</p>
<h3>Tennis Postponed Due to Rain</h3>
<p>(Dentsu, Manila, 18th) The China-Netherlands tennis singles and Japan-Philippines tennis singles, scheduled to be held at 3 PM today, were postponed due to rain and the inability to use the courts.</p>
<h3>The Filipinos Actually Don't Know Our National Anthem</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Manila, 18th) During the opening ceremony of the Far Eastern Games, our country's national music was played, using the Kuomintang party anthem. However, in the swimming venue on both the previous and current days, when our Yang Xiuqiong won first place, the Qingyun Song was played instead. This shows the Filipinos' incompetence in handling affairs, and it is strange that our representatives did not correct it.</p>
<h3>Issue of Revising the Charter: Japan Coerces the Philippines - The Most Noteworthy is the Philippine Attitude</h3>
<p>(Japanese United Press, Manila, 18th) Regarding the issue of revising the Far Eastern Games charter, if the Philippines behaves in bad faith at that time, Japan will no longer propose revising the charter and plans to withdraw from the Games immediately. It is also heard that according to Article 14 of the charter, its third clause must also be revised.</p>
<p>(Japanese United Press, Manila, 18th) As the opening of the General Assembly meeting approaches, the Philippines' attitude of supporting Japan's proposal to revise the Games charter is becoming increasingly firm. Therefore, Japan has decided to propose at the first day of the meeting on the 19th to change "unanimity" in Article 14 of the charter to "majority vote". Japanese representative Abe met with Philippine Deputy Sports President Pagas at 10 AM on the 18th to discuss this matter and obtained his understanding. As a result, problems such as the dissolution of the General Assembly will not occur. If Japan's amendment is passed, the Japanese representative will then raise the issue of Manchuria's participation in order to smoothly pass this case.</p>
<h3>Our Track and Field Has Improved</h3>
<p>(Japanese United Press, Manila, 18th) In today's track and field finals, due to continuous rain, the condition of the stadium was not good, and no good results were seen. Among them, it was unexpected that Japanese sprint star Yoshioka Ryutoku was defeated by Philippine athlete Fielio in the 100-meter final. Also in the high hurdle final, it was unexpected that the Philippines' Garcia, who was expected to win first place, was defeated by Japan's Murakami. Japan excelled in track events and dominated other countries in field events. However, Chinese athletes, who were not expected, intruded between Japan and the Philippines in pole vault, shot put, and high jump, gaining points. It can be said that China's track and field competitions have made progress.</p>
<h3>After Our Tennis Team Returns to Shanghai - They Will Schedule a Match with Japanese Athletes - Lin Wangsu Has Returned to Singapore</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Manila, 18th) Our tennis player Lin Wangsu returned to Singapore on the night of the 17th. Our tennis team has arranged for the Japanese team to stay in Shanghai for two or three days on their way back to hold exhibition matches with us.</p>
<h3>Diligent Bookstore Sends Telegram Congratulating Fu Baolu</h3>
<p>Our country's pole vault king, Mr. Fu Baolu, has come to Shanghai from the Northeast since last year, diligently practicing in the hope of attending the Far Eastern Games to win glory for the country. Shanghai's Diligent Bookstore, renowned throughout the country for publishing sports books, admired Mr. Fu's talent and hired him to work at the bookstore so that he could practice with peace of mind. Yesterday, upon learning that Mr. Fu won second place in the pole vault, they sent a telegram to the Philippines congratulating Mr. Fu, stating: "To Mr. Fu Baolu, c/o the Chinese Consulate in Manila: We are delighted to learn that you won in the pole vault and send our special congratulations."</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Banquet Our Athletes</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Manila, 18th) On the evening of the 18th, twenty-four overseas Chinese groups in the Philippines held a banquet for our athletes.</p>
<h3>The Shimizu Athlete Issue: Japan Files Another Protest</h3>
<p>(Dentsu News Agency, Manila, 18th) Regarding the disqualification of Japanese athlete Shimizu in the high hurdle competition, after the meeting of judges and supervisors, it was decided that athlete Kiyonaga would be third. However, the Philippine track and field team protested and opposed this, leading to a problem with the competition committee. The committee met this morning and decided that Shimizu's disqualification was justified because the meeting of judges and supervisors was frivolous. Thereupon, the Japanese side filed another protest, demanding a rematch and re-judgment.</p>
<h3>Japanese Athletes Rush to Buy Local Products - Japanese Stores Are Exceptionally Busy</h3>
<p>(Dentsu, Manila, 18th) Yesterday, due to heavy rain, all competitions were postponed for a day. Athletes from all countries were able to rest for a day. Japanese athletes, who had competitions until the day before departing for Manila, took advantage of this day of rest to stroll around the streets in small groups, buying local products to give as gifts to relatives and friends upon returning home. As a result, the stores run by Japanese people were extremely busy, with no time to attend to all the customers. In addition, Japanese headquarters staff attended a luncheon hosted by Games President Quezon, and at 6:30 PM they will also attend a dinner hosted by the Chinese Consulate.</p>
<p>Basketball Playoff</p>
<h3>Our Country Loses to the Philippines - 27 to 37, a Difference of Ten Points - The Tense Situation Was Unprecedented</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Manila, 18th) In the basketball playoff held last night at 8 PM between China and the Philippines, our country unfortunately lost with a score of 27-37. In the first half, the Philippine team took the lead 23-13. The intensity of the fighting between the two sides was unprecedented. Due to the overly tense situation, the Philippine side's actions seemed excessive, resulting in numerous fouls. However, our team was unable to remain calm, and very few free throws were made. The situation became even more intense in the second half. As a result of a collision between the Philippines' A.A. and Liu Zhenyuan, A.A.'s wrist was dislocated. Due to losing too many points in the first half, our team's efforts to counterattack in the second half were futile. Center Li Zhenzhong's performance was very satisfactory and outstanding.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Manila, 18th) After the dispute that occurred a few days ago in the China-Philippines basketball game, the competition committee decided on a rematch. At 8 PM on the 18th, the China and Philippines teams met again on the battlefield. Both sides wanted to fight to the death, so the battle was exceptionally intense. However, although our side's technique was exquisite, it could not match the Philippines' strength and momentum. We lost 27-37, and there is less hope for the championship. If we can win the final match against the Philippines on the last day, there will still be a chance for a final decisive battle to win the title. There is still hope. The details of yesterday's battle are recorded below:</p>
<p>In the first half, our team started with Mu Zuoyun, Yu Jingxiao, Wang Yuzeng, Wang Xiliang, Wang Kanruo, etc., with a strong and aggressive momentum. Some beautiful cooperation was well-received by the audience, but they all failed to score. The Philippines took the lead with long-range shots and then added five points with a combination of free throws and field goals, while our side did not score at all, resulting in a score of 9-0. The Philippines was far ahead. Our players were furious. Mu Zuoyun bravely took the lead, like a swallow piercing through the curtain under the basket, and scored a goal, breaking the duck egg. Wang Yuzeng was not willing to be outdone and scored with a long shot. Afterwards, each side made some gains, resulting in a score of 12-5. After the timeout, we sent in the Tianjin Five Tigers, with a greatly enhanced momentum. Short and long shots, quick passing, and good teamwork were evident. Yin Hongxiang made a free throw, closing the gap. Seeing the unfavorable situation, the enemy also made a concerted effort to attack and continued to commit fouls, resulting in a score of 21-9, still a wide difference. Wang Yuzeng, watching from the side, became enraged and entered the game, replacing Li Zhenzhong, trying to save the situation. However, due to the enemy's strong momentum, he still could not break the siege and ultimately lost 13-23.</p>
<p>After the rematch in the second half, the enemy's momentum did not diminish. They attacked from the left and right, making it difficult for us to defend. The enemy then increased by eight points in one breath, while we only gained two points from two free throws by Yin Hongxiang. The situation began to turn slightly. Li Zhenzhong then scored with a long shot, and Yin Hongxiang's beauty was fully displayed under the basket, scoring again, and they gradually made achievements, reaching 20-31, slightly closing the gap. The two sides held each other to a score of 36-33. Yu Jingxiao entered the game replacing Li Zhenzhong, and Wang Xiliang entered the game replacing Zhang Jingshi. However, Tang Baokun and Liu Zhenyuan each made two free throws, and the enemy added two points in return. Then Liu Zhenyuan scored a long-range shot, but it was futile. The Philippines' crude nature was revealed, committing fouls repeatedly. Tang Shikun and Yu Jingxiao each made two free throws, reaching 37-27, but time was running out, the end was declared, and we lost 27-37.</p>
<h3>Opening of the South China Joint Games: Dispute Occurs and Competition is Suspended Midway</h3>

<h3>Opening of the City's Secondary School Games: Finals for Four Men's and Women's Track and Field Events - Continuing This Afternoon</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Secondary School Games, organized by the Shanghai Secondary School Teachers' Association, began at 1 PM yesterday at the Chinese Track and Field Stadium on Rue Pere Robert and will last for three days. The weather was clear yesterday, and the climate was mild. More than 50 schools participated, including St. John's Middle School, Guanghua Affiliated Middle School, Wuben, and Pudong, with more than 5,000 spectators, making it a grand occasion. In addition to the finals for the men's A shot put, men's B high jump, and women's A and B long jump, the remaining events were preliminary rounds. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Opening Ceremony</h3>
<p>The competition venue was the Chinese Track and Field Stadium on Rue Pere Robert. A horizontal banner was hung above the main entrance, reading "Shanghai Secondary School Teachers' Association Organizes the Shanghai Secondary School Spring Games". On the left and right were couplets reading "Strengthen youth's physique, promote national spirit" and "Healthy athletes compete, see whose family wins; all citizens strive for national recovery". The platform was set in the center of the venue, with the judges' stand to the right and the music stand to the left. On the left and right were hung "A healthy athlete competing to see who wins" and "Let's strive to restore our rivers and mountains". The layout was very solemn. The order of the venue was maintained by Boy Scouts assigned by the Boy Scouts Council from Provincial Shanghai High School, Minli, East Asia, and Kaiming schools, who were quite diligent.</p>
<h3>Athletes' Parade</h3>
<p>The meeting opened at 2 PM, and the athletes from each school gathered in front of the platform, with Wang Zhuangfei as the commander-in-chief, parading around the entire venue for one week. The order was as follows: (1) Party and National Flag, (2) Public Security Bureau Military Band, (3) President Pan Gongzhan and Tong Xingbai and Wu Xingya, as well as all referees, (4) Athletes from each school, with neat steps and a strong military appearance.</p>
<h3>President's Speech</h3>
<p>After the parade, President Pan Gongzhan delivered the opening speech, stating briefly that the current situation in our country is extremely dangerous and urgently requires the restoration of national spirit and the consolidation of the national position. To achieve this goal, we must first improve the physique of the general youth. Therefore, today's Games not only hope that the athletes have a sound physique, but also that non-athletes pay attention to exercise to cultivate a sound physique. The true meaning of this Games held by the Secondary School Teachers' Association lies in this.</p>
<h3>Excerpt of Speech</h3>
<p>Then, Tong Xingbai, representative of the Municipal Party Department, delivered a speech, saying that competition is a phenomenon that should exist in a civilized society. What is competed for in the Games is not power and profit, but progress in spirit, morality, and physique. Finally, Wu Xingya delivered a speech, the main idea being that the Games are a test of national revival, and athletes are the vanguard of national revival. He hoped that all students would understand the meaning of the Games, not only to examine our sports competition skills, but its greatest purpose is to take responsibility for national revival and lead the general public to revive our Chinese nation.</p>
<h3>Group Performance</h3>
<p>After the ceremony, sports and group performances began. Participants in group exercises included Shangzhong Private School's single saber, which was full of martial spirit, and Shangzhong Girls' Private School's fitness exercises, with orderly formations and full of spirit. Other performances such as the fitness exercises of Daozhong Girls' Private School and the round formation exercises of Shanghai Kindergarten Normal School were able to win a lot of applause from the audience.

<h3>Output Stage Design of Radio Receivers</h3>
<p>— Ming Xiang</p>
<p>The main task of the vacuum tube in the output stage of a radio receiver is to output the maximum electrical power to the loudspeaker in order to obtain a large volume. To achieve this goal, the effective total impedance of the loudspeaker must be matched to the AC impedance of the output tube's plate circuit in a certain relationship.</p>
<p>For the sake of simplicity, assume that the loudspeaker connected to the plate circuit is a pure resistor. This resistor must be exactly equal to the AC impedance of the output tube in order to maximize the electrical power. Suppose the AC impedance of the output tube is 1000 ohms and the input signal causes a voltage of 20 volts to be generated in the plate circuit. If the load resistance is also 1000 ohms, then the total value of the two is 2000 ohms. According to Ohm's law, the current is 10 milliamperes, and the electrical power on the load resistance is 12R = 100 milliwatts. Now, if the load resistance is changed to any other value, say 500 ohms, then the total resistance is 1500 ohms, the current is 13.3 milliamperes, and the electrical power is 12R = 88.8 milliwatts. This number is smaller than the former. Even if it is changed to any other value, its electrical power must be similarly smaller than 100 milliwatts. Therefore, the total impedance of the loudspeaker must be equal to the total impedance of the output tube's plate circuit in order to obtain the maximum output electrical power.</p>
<p>However, the loudspeaker is not a purely resistive impedance, but a total impedance composed of resistance and inductive reactance, so its value changes with the frequency. It cannot be calculated accurately using mathematical formulas. Furthermore, although the volume of the radio receiver is better the louder it is, the distortion of the sound quality cannot be ignored. Therefore, in actual design, it is most satisfactory to make the total impedance of the loudspeaker when working at a moderate frequency equal to twice the AC impedance of the output tube.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the total impedance of the voice coil of the current loudspeaker is only a dozen ohms. If it is directly connected to the plate circuit with extremely high total impedance, the output electrical power will naturally be pitifully small. Therefore, another medium must be connected, either a choke coil filter or an output transformer. The latter is the most commonly used. By matching the ratio of the number of turns of the primary and secondary coils of the output transformer, a loudspeaker of any total impedance can be applied to an output vacuum tube of any total impedance to obtain the maximum distortion-free power.</p>
<p>The ratio of the number of turns of the output transformer can be calculated according to the following very simple formula:</p>
<p>1/2 (N = 2RA — Z)</p>
<p>N is the turn ratio, RA is the plate impedance of the output tube, and Z is the total impedance of the loudspeaker.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the actual design of the output transformer for readers, the following table is attached for reference:</p>
<p>Number of secondary turns 96 104 72 105 212 67 130 084 601 161 65</p>
<p>Turn ratio 31.6 16.3 11.5 38.7 20.0 13.1 44.8 23.1 16.3 50.0 25.8 18.2</p>
<p>Total impedance of loudspeaker 2.0 ohms 7.5 15.0 2.0 7.5 15.0 2.0 7.5 15.0 2.0 7.5 15.0</p>
<p>Plate impedance of output tube 2000 ohms 2000 2000 3000 3000 3000 4000 5000 4000 5000 5000 5000</p>
<p>This table assumes that the maximum output power is three watts and the cross-sectional area of the core is one and a half square inches.</p>
<p>Although the number of primary turns is not specified in the table, it can be obtained by multiplying the number of secondary turns by the ratio. Although the second item, the total impedance of the loudspeaker, is not easy to measure, it is only necessary to measure twice its DC resistance. The thickness of the winding wire should be determined by the size of the plate current of the primary output tube. The secondary is approximately 20 to 24 gauge.</p>
<h3>The Beam Speed of Radio Wave Propagation?</h3>
<p>— Yong Yan</p>
<p>We all know that the speed of radio wave propagation is the same as the speed of "light," that is, 186,000 miles or 300,000,000 meters per second. However, according to the recent test report of Stokyo and Jouaust to the Paris Academy of Sciences, they actually measured the time required for shortwave radio waves to travel from Paris to Buenos Aires in South America and calculated that the propagation speed was only 167,000 miles per second. If it is a long wave, it is even less, only 152,000 miles per second.</p>
<p>This kind of delay is partly due to the path taken by the radio waves. Because after the radio waves are emitted from the transmitter, they do not completely follow the surface of the earth, but are obliquely shot into the sky, and then reflected back to the earth at high altitude, reflecting back and forth all the way, so it is slower. Another reason for the delay is that the speed of both "light" and "radio waves" is smaller in any substance than in "vacuum."</p>
<h3>Introduction to a Powerful Single-Tube Receiver Using 2A5 Detection</h3>
<p>— Qi</p>
<p>The amplification power of pentode vacuum tubes has long been admired by the radio community. Observing today's new-style radio receivers, most of them use a single-stage audio frequency amplification, and the output sound is loud enough, which is a good proof. Recently, many amateur researchers have been experimenting with pentode detection. Although their results are excellent, there are also some shortcomings, such as the AC noise becoming harsh as the volume increases, which is a pity.</p>
<p>The author recently once experimented with a new 2A5 pentode power tube as a detector to make a semi-AC single-tube receiver. The result was more satisfactory than 74. Now, the circuit and other information are introduced as follows:</p>
<p>The 2A5 vacuum tube is similar to 47. Its filament voltage and current are also the same. However, the amplification coefficient is half as large as 47, and there is one more cathode (the 7A5 lamp holder has six holes).</p>
<p>, its wiring can be found in the attached diagram), so AC noise is not easy to occur. Based on these two advantages, the volume of this machine is powerful and the sound quality is clear. Listening to the major local radio stations can be played on loudspeakers.</p>
<p>(Lamp holder of 2A5)</p>
<p>In order to save costs, this machine adopts a semi-AC type. The A power is supplied by rewinding the doorbell transformer. The B power uses 90V dry battery. If full AC is required, then an ethyl power rectifier tube can be used. The transformer is calculated as follows:</p>
<p>Primary 220V</p>
<p>Secondary (1) 2.5V X 1.75VA</p>
<p>(2) 5V X 25A = 1.250VA</p>
<p>Screen voltage (3) 100V X 0.01A = 1.000VA</p>
<p>6.625VA</p>
<p>Can be calculated as ten watts.</p>
<p>As for the core, wire, and winding, etc., you can refer to the previous issues of this journal's power supply special issue. Other parts are detailed in the diagram, so I won’t repeat them.</p>
<h3>Key Points for Beginners to Assemble Radio Receivers</h3>
<p>— Jiang Zhiban</p>
<p>This article is written for beginner amateur researchers. Presenting personal experience for the benefit of: So that beginner amateur researchers, when they assemble radio receivers, will not only not easily fail, but also get quite good results and increase their interest in research. Now let me introduce them one by one: ‘</p>
<p>(1) Simple Circuit The choice of circuit is a prerequisite for making your own radio receiver. Beginners should only choose simple circuits and should proceed step by step, from crystal radio receivers to vacuum tube radio receivers, from one tube to multiple tubes, from DC to AC, from regenerative to reflex to superheterodyne, from long wave to short wave to very short wave. Aiming too high is the seed of failure. The more complex the circuit, the more experience and knowledge are required. As far as the various circuits themselves are concerned, the simple one has better "efficiency." Beginners can only get the most experience and the best results from simple circuits. If the circuit is too complicated, mistakes will often occur due to insufficient experience, resulting in damage to parts and even discouragement. Besides, if the circuit is complicated, the number of parts increases, and the cost increases accordingly, which is not an economical way. The most important thing is that a complex circuit must have precise instruments to succeed. Therefore, comparing the cost of parts with the results of radio reception, the facts tell us that only simple circuits have better "efficiency."</p>
<p>(2) Purchasing Parts A simple circuit, excellent parts, plus careful assembly, if the effect is not good, I don't believe it. It is easiest to be fooled by being greedy for cheap and buying old goods. Especially vacuum tubes, transformers, and loudspeakers, old ones must never be used. Besides, amateur enthusiasts aim at research.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>Research is the purpose. Today it is a crystal radio receiver, tomorrow it is a vacuum tube radio receiver, after DC it is AC, after long wave is done, change to short wave. You must never think of first making a crystal radio receiver to play with, and buy some cheap goods casually and assemble it. You must know that not only will your crystal radio receiver not be good, but when you want to convert it into a vacuum tube radio receiver in the future, you will find that the cheap goods you bought before are not applicable. At that time, what you thought was cheap at first will become your waste. And cheap goods are not durable, and the result will never be cheap. Especially AC machines and shortwave machines, the parts used must be of the highest quality. Now the market is full of inferior goods, catering to the psychology of the Chinese people who are greedy for cheap, and they do not hesitate to sell the lowest price with extremely inferior materials. The amateur enthusiasts of our country should pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that after the wiring is completed, you must add a check to avoid wiring errors and burn out parts during the test listening. This is extremely important. However, there is also a check that is often overlooked by most people, that is, the inspection of parts before wiring. I once assembled a five-tube machine. After it was assembled, there was no sound at all. After carefully checking the circuit, there were no errors. The vacuum camp was also in good condition and there were no broken wires; it took two hours to find out that the lamp holder of the detection tube and the draft electrode of the detection tube were loosely connected. Since I learned this lesson, before assembling a radio receiver, I check the parts carefully. For example, whether the vacuum tube is broken, whether the variable capacitor is, whether the capacitor insulation is reliable, whether the seat contact is excellent, etc. The inspection of parts is more important for more complex circuits, and amateur enthusiasts must not ignore it.</p>
<h3>Powerful AC Machine Without Power Transformer</h3>
<p>— KMK</p>
<p>The power transformer in an AC radio receiver is the most important part of the entire machine, because all aspects of work are handled by it. For our amateur research community, it is still possible to make our own radio receiver, but it is not easy to make our own power transformer, because most of us do not have the necessary machinery in the ordinary environment, such as winding machines, etc. However, in terms of design, it is even more troublesome. If the frequency of the transformer itself (power transformer) does not match the frequency of the power supply, or if the current itself is not enough for the needs of the whole machine, these are all reasons for burning out the power transformer. The characteristic of the AC radio receiver in the following diagram is that it can be done without a power transformer, then the design can be simplified a lot, and the cost is also more economical!</p>
<p>The filament voltage and C high voltage of the machine are taken directly from the lamp power supply,</p>
<p>(110 volts AC or DC, if used for 220 volts, the power cord can be replaced with a dissipative wire to reduce the voltage). Use a light bulb to match the voltage of the vacuum tube filament (as for its wattage, it can be experimented with and changed, and the vacuum tube filament should not be too bright. When the power supply is connected, the light bulb R will be bright, because the power consumption resistance of the vacuum tube wire pressure is extremely small. This machine uses the new-style compound vacuum tube 6F7 as a powerful detector and low amplifier, and 12Z3 as a half-wave rectifier, so its sensitivity is extremely high. Listening to the broadcasts of various local radio stations does not require sky and earth lines. If sky and earth lines are used, loudspeakers can be connected. The efficiency is above that of ordinary two-tube DC machines. The values of other parts are stated later.</p>
<p>L is wound with 26 gauge enameled wire on a 3-inch diameter spider web board for 10 turns, L1 is wound for 65 turns in the same way, L2 is wound for 30 turns, RFC is wound with 30 gauge for 120 turns, C is 0.0005MFD, C1 is 0.00025MFD, C2 is 0.00025MFD3 is 0.04</p>
<p>MFDC4C5C6 are all 2MFD, R1 is 2MEG1, R2 is a 10,000 ohm variable dissipater, R3 is the same as R2</p>
<p>A.F.C. is a 30 Henry 25 (milli) ampere choke.</p>
<h3>Points to Note When Making a Power Transformer</h3>
<p>— Lu Qing</p>
<p>To obtain the maximum efficiency, the transformer's core loss must be equal to the copper loss.</p>
<p>For a medium-sized transformer, it is most appropriate for the weight of the iron core to be about eight and a half times the weight of the copper. If a power transformer needs to be used continuously for several hours, then the density of the current passing through the copper wire is best at 1300 to 1500 circular mils per ampere.</p>
<p>Because eddy current loss is directly proportional to the thickness of the copper wire, in order to reduce this loss, the copper wire in the transformer should not be too thick than necessary.</p>
<p>Because the hysteresis loss of the iron core is directly proportional to the 1.6th power of the magnetic flux density and the frequency of the current; and because the eddy current loss is directly proportional to the square of the magnetic flux density, the square of the frequency of the current, and the square of the thickness of the iron sheet; therefore, in order to reduce the specific loss, in addition to the current frequency that is inconvenient to change due to the generator relationship, its magnetic flux density should be reduced within a considerable range, and at the same time, the silicon steel sheet used as the iron core should be thinner. However, the iron sheet should not be too thin, because if it is too thin, the part occupied by air between the two iron sheets will inevitably increase, so the iron sheets commonly used are mostly 26 or 28 gauge. The edges of the iron sheet should not be burred, because if they are burred, the place where the burrs are raised will connect the two iron sheets into a very thick conductor, thereby increasing the risk of eddy current loss. Iron sheets should not be bent or impacted, and should not be inserted or removed frequently, so as not to damage the thin layer of oxide on their surface used to prevent eddy currents.</p>
<p>The combination of iron sheets should be very good so that magnetic flux lines can flow smoothly between them.</p>
<p>The space factor (that is, the ratio of the space occupied by the copper wire to the total space that can be wound) should be large.</p>
<p>If the wire used is thicker, it should be silk enameled to reduce the risk of short circuits.</p>
<p>The insulating cloth used should be wrapped to a considerable insulation strength, but not too much. Because if there is too much, the heat generated inside will not be easily dissipated, resulting in danger. The primary and secondary stages of the transformer should be very close and must be well insulated.</p>
<p>The screws used to clamp the iron sheets should be made of copper and have a thin diameter to reduce eddy current loss.</p>

<h3>Small Experiences</h3>
<p>— Wu Shanliang</p>
<p>(1) Symptoms and Remedies for Depleted A Batteries</p>
<p>Ordinary amateurs use dry batteries to power tube filaments. After a while, the A battery will always run out because it is a primary battery. When the A battery is about to run out, there is a symptom: when you turn up the potentiometer to its maximum, the sound is still audible, but the loudness gradually decreases. At that time, you need to replace the battery.</p>
<p>If you are using a 201 vacuum tube, and the A battery consists of four dry cells connected in series to provide six volts, you can reverse the position of the batteries, that is, switch the front and back, which may slightly extend its lifespan.</p>
<p>There is another method: pour a solution of ammonium chloride into the used battery, which can slightly increase its potential. However, according to my experiments, pouring the solution into a cardboard-type flashlight battery has a minimal effect, while pouring it into a paste-type battery has a better effect.</p>
<p>(2) Remedies for Depleted B Batteries</p>
<p>When the B battery is about to run out, even if you tighten the regeneration coil or increase the capacitance of the variable capacitor that adjusts the regenerative power, you will still hear whistling or insufficient loudness. At that time, the potential difference of the B battery must have decreased significantly. Then, you can use two sheets of cigarette tin foil separated by glass or wax paper to create a larger bypass capacitor and connect it to both ends of the headphones, which can increase the volume significantly, but it will be ineffective if the voltage drops too low.</p>
<h3>Domestic and Foreign News</h3>
<p>Sales of Stewart Radios from the American Radio Corporation are Extremely Successful: The Stewart radio, produced by the renowned American Stewart factory, has been sold worldwide for a long time. It is exclusively managed in China by the American Radio Corporation. The machine is sturdy, energy-saving, and durable, and has long been praised and highly regarded. New shipments are arriving in Shanghai on the President Jackson steamship. It is said that the quality will be even better, and the price will not increase. The company has also shipped a large quantity of radio components and Sullivan vacuum tubes from the United States, which are of high quality and sold at a very reasonable price.</p>
<p>Tian Er Radio Company: Since Tian Er Radio Company on Renji Road took over the repair business of the former Wheeler Company, the business has been very busy. This is because many newly hired repair experts can still deliver goods within 48 hours, which is extremely fast. Anyone who needs to repair a radio may wish to visit the company, and they will be satisfied.</p>
<p>French Broadcasting Industry: According to recent statistics, the number of people in France who have radios has reached 1.3 million. In other words, 3.1% of the French population are radio listeners. The total value of the above radios is 530 million francs. In the near future, with the promotion of radio networks and the revision of broadcasting programs, it is expected that the number of radio listeners will greatly increase.</p>

<h3>Financial Silver Futures Fail to Meet Expectations, Gold Prices Rebound by 3.2 Yuan</h3>
<p>Silver Bulls Expect International Silver Conference, Market Remains Weak: Yesterday's gold market experienced a rebound as silver futures failed to meet expectations. It should have rebounded, but overseas telegraphic news remained unfavorable, and the market was weak. Sentiment was stable, and the market was able to improve. The market is quite stable, and fluctuations have become quiet. The afternoon market was idle. The market opened higher in the morning due to the rise in silver prices in both London and the United States. However, the gold exchange rate for silver rose by only 0.47 to 0.52 fen (cents). The exchange rate remained stable. The price of raw gold in London rose by one penny, and the price of American cotton rose by seventeen pounds. Sentiment was stable, and the market could have opened higher. The opening price for goods was 10 yuan, but the Associated Press reported that the president is expected to report to Congress on the silver issue on Monday. The main conditions of the case are to recognize silver as currency, as well as a 25% currency reserve. The government has the right to purchase silver up to $1.29 per ounce. However, official opinions do not limit the date to purchase 25% of silver, and because the government has the right to investigate the difference between the price obtained from possessing silver and the government price, a 50% silver tax will be levied. Due to this news, it was difficult to rise, and the situation was weak. In the end, the news was unfavorable to speculators. The market was able to rebound after opening, but due to the hardening of the domestic market, Reuters reported that the American Silver Bulls expected a ten thousand national currency system conference to discuss the silver case after the silver legislation was established. President Roosevelt will address Congress tomorrow, advising that silver action will include permission to bring silver under ownership and an order to declare silver as currency. The market then fell. Afterwards, the domestic market tightened, and buyers were eager, gradually rebounding. However, due to the slight setback in the price of silver in the Seattle night market, the central government opened cash, and the Guang Bang and other institutions also moved higher. The afternoon closing was flat. The market rose later due to the price of silver in the Seattle night market decreasing by 1.25 and rising by 1.25. The appetite of banks was also healthy, and the market was quite strong. There were not many transactions afterwards, and the domestic market was slightly looser and weaker, but large investors made up for their positions, struggling a lot. The market fluctuated. The price of red gold was 1022 yuan, and the swap premium was slightly over 1 yuan. Banks will be closed on the 21st of this month (next Monday), and the gold market will also be closed for one day. Today's market conditions will be recorded later.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 1009 yuan, slightly higher than the previous closing by half a yuan. The opening price for goods was 9.5 yuan. Shunmao, Richang, and Qianchangxiang repeatedly purchased, because the Associated Press report seemed to have little impact. The gold market rose from 8 yuan to 13.5 yuan. The foreign exchange market trended loose. Hengxing, Yifengyong, Dalianbang, Yingfengheng, Yuanchun, Zhengchang and others joined in competing to sell.

<h3>Foreign Exchange Finally Trends Tighter</h3>
<p>According to overseas telegraphic news yesterday, London's large strips rose by 5625 in both the near and far terms. American silver rose by 875, and silver futures rose by only 4.7%. The British pound to US dollar was unchanged, the US dollar to British pound rose by 125, the British pound to French franc fell by 16 pounds, and the US dollar to French franc rose by 1.5 fen. The price of raw gold in London rose by one penny, the private telegram silver price rose by 4375, and the exchange rate rose by 25. The landed rate was flat. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with a near-term selling price of 1 shilling 3 pence 4375, and a US dollar of 32.875 yuan, which was 0.0625 tighter for the British pound and 0.125 tighter for the US dollar compared to the previous close. After opening, it was slightly looser. The HSBC listing was announced, with both the British pound and US dollar flat. Later, it gradually tightened. However, it was difficult to stabilize due to the rise in the price of silver in the Seattle night market. The Central Bank opened cash, and the gold market trended higher. The market situation was flat. In the afternoon, the market immediately tightened due to the price of silver in the Seattle night market decreasing by 125. Afterwards, it slightly loosened under the supply from China to Hong Kong. There were not many transactions. The closing near-term selling price was 1 shilling 3 pence 4375 for the British pound, and 32.875 yuan for the US dollar, which was 0.0625 tighter for the British pound and 0.125 tighter for the US dollar compared to the previous close. Chinese merchants slightly bought. The French franc was pegged by Mai Jia Li at 498 in June, and 504 in August, with a difference of 8 centimes. Today's transaction record is listed below.</p>
<p>The British pound opened in the morning with a near-term selling price of 1 shilling 3 pence 4375.

<h3>Discount Bills Depressed and Unpromising</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign discount bill market was still depressed and unpromising. Both the morning and afternoon markets were 6 fen, with no change compared to the previous few days. The markup water was still 2 fen. Since the end of April, the financial market has been almost like a stereotype. Although there are occasional changes, they are minimal. Because various industries in society have no hope of development, the financial industry will inevitably decline along with it. Bank receipts and deliveries are also declining day by day. A review of the past few days suggests a gradual decrease. Foreign banks received and delivered over 2.1 million in bills, over 2.39 million in various commodity and foreign exchange pledges, over 10,000 in telegraphic transfers, and 400,000 from warehouses. Chinese banks received and delivered over 2.1 million in bills, over 3.3 million in various commodity and foreign exchange pledges, over 400,000 in customs duties, and 300,000 from warehouses. Japanese banks received and delivered over 1.9 million in bills, over 3.8 million in various commodity and foreign exchange pledges, and 500,000 from warehouses. However, what we should pay attention to is that various receipts and deliveries are gradually declining, while the commodity and foreign exchange receipts and deliveries of Japanese banks not only have not decreased, but seem to be progressing. The transaction of discount bills, the transfer and new transactions in the morning market was over 4.4 million, the transactions in the afternoon market was over 300,000, the transactions in the Small General Association was over 200,000. The cash shop foreign public list receipts and deliveries was over 39 million, the foreign markup water was over 4.8 million, various road remittance was over 500,000, the cash receipt was over 200,000, the foreign pledge transaction redemption was over 500,000, the new transaction was over 1.2 million, the banknotes recovered over 500,000, the issuance was over 800,000, the customer source was 300,000, and the stomach loss was 25,000. In addition, the total number of exchanges by the Shanghai Clearing House on the 18th was 6,717,840.39 yuan, including 3,516,195.42 yuan in silver dollars and 3,201,644.97 yuan in drafts.</p>
<h3>Subsidiary Currency Continues to Fall - Copper Coins Suddenly Short by 5,000 Cash</h3>
<p>Recently, subsidiary currencies have been trending downwards for many days, and yesterday's market price continued to fall. Jiangnan subsidiary currency was 834 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets, down 1 yuan from the previous day. The transaction in the morning market was 7,500 units, and the afternoon market was 2,000 units. Guangdong subsidiary currency was 738.4 yuan in the morning market, still up 0.2 yuan from the previous day. Although the number was extremely small, it seemed possible to reverse the decline. However, because the demand was less, it fell again by 0.3 yuan to 738.1 yuan at the close of the afternoon market, and as a result, it was still down 0.1 yuan from the previous day, resulting in a continued decline. The market price of copper coins suddenly shortened by 5,000 cash compared to the previous day, to 331,000 cash, and the transaction consideration was 10,200 yuan, equivalent to 33,752 cash.</p>
<h3>Securities Market is Dull; Yesterday, Public Bonds Showed Signs of a Short Squeeze - The Largest Jump in Gold Shorts, 9.5 Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market of the China Merchants Securities Exchange gradually became active. The bond market, which had been hovering for many days, actually saw the short squeeze form first. Although the current situation is still dull as ever, the shorts have actually started to swap out their shares. The number of short positions in the No. 5 securities in particular, have started to see some make up trades. I heard from a certain house that the number of floating positions have been transferred to another house off market. The market is completely subject to the uneven distribution of chips, and the fluctuations are gradually increasing. Retail shorts also have hedge positions. The tightness of the situation may continue to be good. However, whether there is sustainability is still subject to the environment. Yesterday's experience, continuing the tightness of the previous day, continued to rise, and each market since the morning market has been slightly firm. The afternoon situation was better in comparison. In the morning, No. 6 bought in, and all the bonds were good, but only 0.5 to 2 jiao at most. The second plate also continued to firm up by about 1 jiao. The trend has not yet completely escaped the hovering state. The market opened in the afternoon, and No. 5, No. 43, and No. 49 all bought in. Market prices continued to rise, with short term gold rising the most, by 3.5 jiao. No. 96 felt depressed instead, still down 0.5 jiao. The closing situation was even better for short term gold, up another 4 jiao, and the rest continued to firm up. After the market closed, the sentiment was firm. The situation in the afternoon was mostly swapping, and the shorts seemed to be squeezed. As a result, market prices all continued to rise by 1.2 jiao to about 0.5 yuan, while short term gold rose by 7 jiao to 9.5 jiao. The total number of transactions was 12.232 million yuan. The comparison of the rise and fall is listed below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market and Commodities Rise Together</h3>
<p>The Xinfeng Foreign Company reported that the New York stock market and commodities rebounded sharply yesterday (17th). In general, it is expected that the currency will continue to expand due to the silver legislation. At the same time, the researchers of the Exchange Management Act disagreed on the issue of granting management rights to the Federal Trade Commission or establishing a new agency, which caused new difficulties for the case. Holmes Tuck Gold Mine stocks soared by 17 yuan, and silver stocks also rose by more than 6 yuan. Small exchanges followed the stock exchange to rise, and bonds with speculative nature rose. High-grade bonds were firm, and US Treasury bonds were mixed. Grains were first affected by silver and rose, then fell due to forecasts of impending rain. According to the agent's report, the securities market is expected to be boosted by the expansion of silver, and trading is brisk with a vigorous rebound. As for wheat, the public gradually paid attention to the drought, and there were more transactions. There is still no hope for relief, the weather is unchanged, hot and dry, and the harvest situation is bad. As for cotton, trading was active, and it rose due to the silver agreement. However, due to the concession of the silver faction and the full authority of Roosevelt, its impact has been greatly reduced. The vigor of wheat is also a major driving force for the market's progress. Most of it is purchased by foreign countries and brokers, and the industry has some needs, but it is clearly unwilling to follow. Spot goods are firm. As for rubber, there were uncertain fluctuations, and it was later affected by the firmness of other markets. Brokers bought in, and prices rebounded. As for sugar, the market was quiet and firm, with slightly new purchases and scarce supply. As for silver, the initial news from Washington was smooth, and purchases were enthusiastic, causing it to rise. In the afternoon, the bulls took profits, and prices fell slightly. The public outlook is high. The total number of transactions throughout the day was 1.29 million shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn Prices Rise Slightly</h3>
<p>The yarn market rose slightly because overseas cotton markets trended higher, which made sentiment slightly firmer. However, real demand is even more dull. North China bought a lot for shipment to Japan, so trading has stagnated recently. Therefore, sellers have no intention of hedging, and the market's upward momentum is weak. However, as the price of raw cotton rises step by step, manufacturers are becoming more and more difficult.</p>
<h3>Golden Cock Brand Yarn at a Good Price of 56 Jiao</h3>
<p>The forward yarn market opened higher, following the cotton market's rise. Prices for all months increased by 4, 5, 6, and 7 jiao. The market atmosphere was quite tight during the afternoon session. At the close, it was reported that there were few spot yarn transactions, and prices fell by another 3 or 4 jiao. Consequently, each month only increased by 1 or 3 jiao. The total transaction volume for the day was 12,200 bales. Sales included 650 bales from Dafeng, 700 bales from Yukang, 1,500 bales from Yuanda, 700 bales from Dafu, 400 bales from Tongxing, 400 bales from Yuda, and 400 bales from Yongchang.</p>

<h3>Spot Yarn Sales at 500 Bales</h3>
<p>The sales of spot yarn are increasingly sluggish. It is estimated that various guilds purchased a total of 500 bales throughout the day. The market conditions are similar to the previous day. The purchase volume by each guild is as follows:</p>
<p>Inland: 280  Jinan: 40  Yunnan: 80</p>
<p>Ningbo: 25 Guangdong: 70  Shantou: 5</p>
<h3>Cotton's Rising Trend Intensifies</h3>
<p>The cotton market is strengthening, and the rising trend is becoming increasingly intense, with a short-covering atmosphere permeating the market. Simultaneously, both the U.S. and Indian cotton markets are rising, making market sentiment even tighter. The Ningbo guild is absorbing large quantities, and those covering short positions are particularly eager. However, the yarn market is flat, and the current situation for cotton mills is still considered stable.</p>
<h3>Forward Cotton Rises Another 3-4 Jiao</h3>
<p>The forward cotton market opened higher, with excellent foreign cotton. The market lacked major sellers, and prices for all months increased by 2 or 3 jiao. The market situation remained strong in the afternoon, and prices for all months rose by another jiao. The total transaction volume for the day was 122,700 dan. Sales included 3,700 dan from Suilong, 4,600 dan from Yuanda, 2,200 dan from Gengfeng, 2,300 dan from Shenchang, 3,900 dan from Renfeng, 2,300 dan from Xiesheng, 2,900 dan from Yongchang, 2,300 dan from Yicheng, and 1,700 dan from Yifeng.

<p>Total Open Interest: 663,600</p>
<h3>Spot Cotton Mills Turn Dull</h3>
<p>The demand for spot cotton is slightly stagnant. Due to sluggish yarn sales and high cotton prices, the mills are quite dull. The sources include 900 bales of Tonghua cotton. Spot cotton prices are as follows: Shashi cotton at 41.50. Donghua Factory imported 300 pieces. Sent to the factory, Shaanxi cotton at 42.05. Zhentai Factory imported 200 pieces. Also, also, also, at 43.00, Dacheng Factory imported 160 pieces. Warehouse delivery also at 42.90, Sulun Factory imported 100 pieces. Also, also.</p>
<h3>Active Trading in American Cotton</h3>
<p>Yesterday's American cotton market situation: Due to good news from Liverpool and strong activity on Wall Street, buyers were eager and the market situation was firm and active. As a result, spot prices rose by 15 points per pound, and futures prices rose by 15 to 17 points per pound. Liverpool cotton futures rose by 5 to 7 points. Egyptian cotton futures rose by 3 points. The Bombay cotton market initially fell due to Japanese and European exporters selling Balaras New Cotton, but later rose due to speculators buying heavily in July and August. As a result, Pingal rose by 1 rupee and 7.5 annas, Oomra rose by 2 rupees, and Balaras rose by 3 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left. (Telegram dated 17th)</p>

<h3>Grain: New Wheat Enters the Market, Forward Flour and Wheat Plunge in Unison</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market: After opening in the morning, prices for all months showed a sharp decline. Due to quotations for foreign wheat, Chicago rose by about 2 or 3 jiao, while Canada fell by 2 or 3 jiao. Therefore, although the market showed weakness after the opening, the degree of decline was still minimal. However, later, due to favorable weather and a good outlook for the new wheat crop, coupled with the fact that various northern guilds were uninterested in purchasing due to the cheapness of old wheat, market sentiment became very weak, and prices fell step by step thereafter. By the time the afternoon session opened, with sluggish retail sales and a wait-and-see attitude from various actual sales guilds, large and small factories were dumping both near-term and far-term contracts. Therefore, market sentiment continued to decline step by step. Judging from the current market sentiment and environment, this type of market value is likely to continue to decline, as the new wheat harvest is near and northern sales are making little progress. Therefore, people in the industry are particularly worried. As a result, the current month fell by 2 fen and 2.5 li, June fell by 3 fen, July to September fell by 2 fen and 7.5 li, and October fell by 3.5 fen.</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market: After the opening of the wheat futures market, prices for all months showed a unanimous and sharp decline. Regarding foreign wheat quotations, Chicago and Canada each had increases and decreases of 2 or 3 jiao. However, at present, the market pays little attention to the ups and downs of foreign wheat, as the domestic new wheat crop will enter the market shortly, and weather conditions will inevitably play a role. Yesterday, due to the favorable weather and predictions that there would be no rain during the wheat harvest, people generally realized that old wheat was being shipped in continuously, and factories were also unloading foreign wheat. After this, demand would inevitably come to a standstill, so market sentiment weakened, and forward quotations could no longer be maintained. As a result, July and August fell by 7 fen, and September fell by 8 fen. The spot wheat market has been active in both arrivals and sales recently, and the market has been standing firm. Yesterday, Fuxin continued to handle 5,000 bales of wheat from various routes, with prices ranging from 3 yuan, 2 yuan and 9 jiao and 5 fen, to 2 yuan and 9 jiao.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Turns Slack, Falling Back by Approximately One Jiao</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday's sources for various guilds were similar to the previous day, still dominated by late rice. About 30 shipments of thick japonica and various varieties arrived, totaling only over 6,000 shi. However, the sales market turned slack, the situation was quiet, and transactions were scarce. The bagging of late rice was stagnant, and the sources were abundant, so although retail sales moved, they were ultimately limited and did not help the overall situation. Apart from the Songjiang goods of over 100 bales and a small amount of Sibang and Fenggang goods purchased by the Beiyang guild, the remaining Qingbang, Sibang, Xibang, and Lianbang goods increased significantly, and the market situation softened by two chi. Due to the scarcity of thick japonica rice, the sellers tried to tighten the situation, but the rural guests had no intention of purchasing, so the Changbang and Sutongbang goods failed to be sold, and the market situation did not fluctuate much. However, the Nanhang early rice had more arrivals and could only be sold off, resulting in a market decline of nearly one jiao. Du Yangjian and Yinbian Yuan showed no change.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, 36 or 37 ships arrived at the port from various guilds in Hexia. Various colors of white japonica and white yuan rice were sluggish, while some transactions occurred in Yangjian, Dujian, and Bujian rice. Early thin rice and Kejian rice were average, Yin Yuan arrivals and sales were balanced, the price of particularly high-quality white japonica rice was stable, and the price of medium-quality white japonica rice, Bian Yuan early rice, and thin rice fell by one or two jiao. Yangjian, Dujian, and Bujian rice prices were flat and weak. Kejian rice saw small fractions, and Yin Yuan showed no significant fluctuation.</p>
<h3>Ke Xian Rice Increases by One Jiao and a Half - Medium Quality Rough Rice Sees Strong Arrivals and Falls Back by Five Fen -</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Ke Xian rice market situation: The demand from the Ke rice dealers was still greedy. Yesterday, the main focus was on the local street and inland Zhejiang and Ningbo rice. The Fujian guild was wary due to the high price and only purchased 1,500 bales. The local street and inland areas purchased 8,500 bales. The Ningbo guild paid attention to foreign rice and jointly purchased 3,000 bales with the inland areas. Due to the peak season for machine-milled rice, the local street demand was particularly greedy. However, the arrivals to the river were few and the inventories were low. The machine-milled rice arrivals were also scarce. Yesterday, the local street purchased 300 bales of newly arrived Hunan machine-milled rice, and the price increased by another jiao and a half, with selling prices ranging from 10 yuan and 7 jiao and 5 fen to 10 yuan and 5 jiao and 5 fen, and long-grain rice at 10 yuan and 1 jiao. Yesterday, the arrivals of rough and machine-milled rice were very high, totaling 6,000 to 7,000 bales, especially Shashi rough rice, with both arrivals and inventories being large. Therefore, yesterday, the price of medium-quality Shashi rough rice fell back by a small amount of four or five fen, while high-quality rough rice held steady. The inventory of machine-milled rice was not much, and it remained strong.</p>
<h3>Yellow Soybeans Fall Back by a Strong Six Fen</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Tianjin-Pukou Railway yellow soybeans: Due to the weakness of the bean cake market and the inactivity of factory demand, market sentiment was weak, and the market price fell by more than six fen compared to when the rising trend was in effect. The only outlets were exports to the Xiamen guild and local street consumption. There were no other inquiries. The total market transaction was two carloads of Zhengyangguan soybeans, priced at 2 yuan and 9 jiao and 9 fen to 9 jiao and 7 fen, and three carloads of Feihe soybeans, priced from 2 yuan and 9 jiao and 5 fen to 9 jiao and 2 fen.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: New Cocoons and Factory Silk Disposed of, But Prices Not Weak</h3>
<p>The spring silkworm season in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces is approaching. European and American firms, seeing that overseas silk inventories are gradually thinning, have started to cheaply purchase new cocoons and factory silk. Various manufacturers, believing that this year's improved silkworm breeding season is better and that the spring cocoon harvest is promising, with the price of fresh cocoons said to be around 20 yuan per dan, are all disposing of forward silk contracts based on this standard. Transactions are not weak, with European and American foreign firms and domestic silk merchants disposing of 140 bales of new factory silk from July to August. Prices remain unchanged.</p>
<h3>Spring Silkworm Season in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Is Widespread - Heavy Rain the Day Before Yesterday, Fortunately Only Half a Day, No Major Impact</h3>
<p>(Pingyao) In the Pingyao area of Hangzhou, many farmers are raising improved silkworms this year. The weather was too cold during the breeding period, and hatching was delayed. The weather was cold and immoderate after the first sleep, and the silkworms had a loss of appetite, but the loss was still minor. When the silkworms began their major sleep, the weather turned sunny and warm, and development was smooth. Some have already finished their cycle and are beginning to spin their cocoons, while those still in their cycle are thriving. The heavy rain the day before yesterday, fortunately, only lasted for half a day, and the weather was still very warm, so the silkworms are still in good condition. (Xin Deng, Lutou, Shukou, and Sanxi Town and other places, farmers are hatching this year) Those who raised their own seeds were not weak, but the weather was unfavorable, and thunderstorms caused problems. Most of the early silkworms were discarded, so they all supplemented with improved seeds and paid attention to feeding. After the third sleep, the weather was sunny and warm, and the temperature and humidity were suitable for silkworm breeding, and development turned better. The early batches have already gone through their major sleep and are thriving, and there are not many remnants of the local varieties. The process is also good. The cloudy and rainy day before yesterday lasted half a day, but the climate was still warm, so there was no major impact.</p>
<p>(Danyang) Farmers in various cities and villages who have their own mulberry trees are all hatching improved seeds. Unfortunately, the spring was cold and rainy, so the seeds were hatched behind schedule. After the leaves opened, it rained continuously, and it was suddenly cold and suddenly hot. Great care was taken in feeding the young silkworms. Fortunately, there were enough leaves after the second sleep, and the weather was sunny and smooth, so the silkworms developed smoothly. Early batches have already had enough leaves for the third sleep, and late batches are also opening leaves. The heavy rain the day before yesterday was widespread, but it turned sunny and warm in the afternoon, so the impact was still minor.</p>
<h3>HeKou Black Tea Opens</h3>
<p>Yesterday, new goods from HeKou Black Tea, which belongs to Qianshan County in Jiangxi Province, were already on the market. British firms such as Jinlong, Yihe, and Xiehe were showing strong interest, opening with a new price of 65-66 yuan, which was not much higher or lower than last year. The selling price of Wenzhou black tea has already risen by three or four yuan compared to the previous offer, and the black tea market is quite firm. As for the various types of green tea, yesterday the various shops and dealers were slightly restocking on both the Sui'an and Tuzhuang Zhenmei varieties due to the approaching shipping schedule. However, the recognized prices were even tighter than before, and it seemed difficult to allow a quick viewing of the situation.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Qingbai Sugar Sees Mixed Price Fluctuations</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market: Because both customs gold and standard gold saw further declines, the trend was . The guild allocated 24 rough , and it was sold at 20 yuan and 8 jiao, one jiao lower than the previous day. 8/9 Dutch red sugar was allocated at 15 yuan and 8 jiao and a half. Taikoo Sugar B mark called for the original price but was not sold. Zhenji's own factory called for 19 yuan and 3 jiao for No. 1 white sugar, but it was also not made. Chaoqing's prices are rising again and again, making it very tight. Yesterday, the city goods opened with 600 bales, rising by one jiao. Huanggang Qing at 11 yuan 9 jiao to 8 jiao, secondary Jie Qing at 11 yuan 56 jiao, Bannan Qing at 11 yuan 34 jiao, Longgang Qing at 11 yuan 1 jiao. The following opened with more than 200 bales, rising another one or two jiao, to 11 yuan 2 jiao to 3 jiao. Then, several hundred boxes of small box flake Qing were opened, priced at 9 yuan 4 jiao, rising four jiao from before. The bottom of Qing sugar is already not thick, and land prices are also tight, so the market must rise again.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Asphalt Falls Endlessly</h3>
<p>The asphalt market is like a waterfall, without any mainstay to stop it. According to reports, the price of Macheng oil from Hanshi has fallen from 12 yuan and 56 jiao to 12 yuan 23 jiao recently. Although it is said that high-quality goods are not being sold, and only second- and third-rate goods are being sold, there are about 20,000 inventories. I am afraid that they will not be able to hold on for long, so the purchase price has been reduced to 12 yuan in the customs, and it is difficult to achieve the goal for a while, but in the end, it is feared that it will be realized. However, the inventory of Jingzhi and Jincha goods is slightly scarce, and it is said that some people have offered 13 yuan per mu into customs but have not sold them, so although Macheng has fallen, the rest is still stable. However, the use of soap factories has been hopeless, and the number of deposits in various places is still abundant. If it all depends on the candles, there is no such a large outlet. Moreover, the use of candles in summer is now out of order. The soap use that I relied on in previous years is now completely hopeless, so the clear and light sales market is unprecedented in the last ten years. Sales must be , so those who are not for sale, are really , and there are still few who have to . Therefore, according to the market price , there can be a hope , the inventory of local firms has been thin, and there are still coming , recently the fell to 16 yuan a little , not much , very little trading, oil still, local 15 yuan and 7 or 8 jiao, 16 yuan and 7 or 8 jiao.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Hunan Lotus Seeds Long Weak and Stagnant - The Price in Hankou Has Already Turned for the Better -</h3>
<p>Hunan lotus seeds have been stagnant for a long time, and the market is unusually weak. Prices are gradually easing. Check the market inventory is not thick, the market is another, there is a lack of wholesale transactions, the market is a slump, and the weather will gradually get hotter, and the goods are not good, there is a change in the situation is even more difficult to pick up, but the Hankou market has recently turned up, Shanghai is still tired, the high goods are only 42/43 yuan, the ordinary is 37/38 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hardware: New Iron Wire Has Been Still for Too Long and Desires to Move</h3>
<p>There are not many arrivals of new iron wire, and market sentiment is very good, but actual transactions are not strong, and the market is deserted. Yesterday, guilds in Wenzhou and Fujian had large-scale purchases, and the market trend seems to want to move. The price of No. 16 to No. 20 is estimated at 14 yuan per city dan, and No. 21 to No. 25 is 17 yuan and 5 jiao. Yesterday's transaction was more than 170 to 80 dan. Although sales have not been high for several days, the prices are high and the inventory is thin, so the situation in the coming market is still optimistic.</p>

<h3>What Can Be Done</h3>
<p>— Fei Xin</p>
<p>There is a joke that goes like this: Wang Jinggong often did not wash his face or head, and his face was very dark and ugly. A servant brought in bath beans and asked him to wash his face. Jinggong said, "Heaven made me black, what can bath beans do to me!" "What can be done," translated into plain language, means "What can you do to me!" or "What can you do to me!" Confucius said, "What can Huan do to me!" Wang Mang also said, "What can the Han soldiers do to me!" All of these were said when there was no way to deal with the situation.</p>
<p>If you want to give an example under the "Humor" category, this is a very good example.</p>
<p>However, this kind of spirit has not been seen much in modern times. Persisting in being strong to the end also has a slightly outward appearance but dry inside meaning, with the suspicion of pretending to be calm. It is, of course, laughable to say these words, but there are many situations in which they are not said even when they have reached this point.</p>
<p>Once this wonderful method is spread and implemented, the world will not be peaceful. Of course, smart people only regard it as "humor" and laugh it off; fools will take it seriously and become strong everywhere, "What can be done to me?" Many places will make people have no way to deal with it. The essence is that there is nothing to fear. The highest limit is just death. After death, it is impossible to know, so it is unnecessary to discuss it, but everyone only has one death in their life, which is certain. Whether the world is real or illusory, the most important thing is the emotion of life and death. If there is something to fear, the ultimate fear is nothing more than fear of death. However, Confucius was not afraid of death long ago, Wang Mang was not afraid, and Wang Anshi was even more afraid. It seems that they are saying: I was born to be this kind of person, what can you do to me? Therefore, Wang Anshi said: Changes in nature are not to be feared, people's words are not to be worried about, and ancestors are not to be followed!</p>
<p>At present, no matter "standing in what kind of position" to see, China is indeed close to danger, but just needs a group of people who are not afraid of people, not afraid of ghosts, not afraid of all kinds of people, advanced literature, golden rules, bombs, guns······ to expand the spirit of benevolence and save this endangered nation!</p>
<p>Of course, you also have to be unafraid of "bath beans"!</p>
<h3>Self-Introduction</h3>
<p>— Han Qing</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a fashionable trend in society, especially popular among the scholar-official class. This trend does not yet have a proper name, so let's call it "self-introduction" for now.</p>
<p>Opening the newspaper, we often see a "introduction" column. Generally, the introducers are mostly well-known people in society, and the people being introduced are mostly what are called "people with unfulfilled talents" or "people whose music is too high for the masses to understand." In the modern complex society, the relationship between people is not as simple as in the closed era. The need to "introduce talents" should not be less than the need to "introduce books" or "introduce things." However, the introducer should honestly and concisely describe the resume and skills of the person being introduced, and should not add lengthy clichés to the person being introduced, lest the reader misunderstand that he is looking at an advertisement and lose the original meaning of "introduction." However, the reader can forgive the introducer's difficulties if the introductory text is written excessively. Because our fellow countrymen value face the most, and would rather exaggerate than be simple and precise. That is to say, if a person's skill is only five points, you must at least blow it up to ten points. Otherwise, the person being introduced will not only not thank you, but will also form an unnecessary enemy. Therefore, the more beautiful the introductory text is written, the more the reader will give it a big discount.</p>
<p>Since the introducer's text has lost its effect, some cunning people have invented a method of "self-introduction."</p>
<p>For example, if a university professor or writer in a foreign country has passed away, it is a proper expression of "emotion" for his friends and favorite readers to write some poems and articles in newspapers and magazines to mourn him, and there is nothing to criticize. But there is a kind of person who, in the article mourning the teacher, insists that his teacher is an unparalleled saint of the time, who is excellent in learning and conduct, and whose disciples are all over the world, simply the reincarnation of Confucius and Socrates. Then, he writes out the names of the students of the deceased in order of association</p>
<p>, and claims that he is the most proud student of the deceased, as if he wants to put his position in the same rank as Yanzi and Plato. Finally, he also publishes a detailed advertisement for his own collection of works at the bottom of the newspaper, to show that "learning has a source." Alas, skillfully done, the psychology of "self-introduction"!</p>
<p>In fact, "self-introduction" is not a bad thing. As long as you show your true skills to others, they will naturally admire you, and you don't need to waste your words to boast about yourself. When we see the story of Mao Sui recommending himself, the heart</p>
<p>is only sympathy and admiration, and feels that his actions are worthy of being the true colors of a hero. He does not exaggerate how brilliant his family is, he does not cite how wise his teacher is, he does not boast about what position he occupies in the relationship between his family and teachers and friends, he just needs to find a suitable opportunity to show his skills.</p>
<p>"Peaches and plums do not speak, but a path is formed naturally." I hope that the young and ambitious people in the country will work hard to cultivate themselves into complete people who are excellent in learning and conduct, and not belittle themselves, so as not to fall into the situation of "relying on others to succeed." True skills will always be appreciated by someone, so why take this ingenious plan to praise the dead, but actually intend to promote yourself.</p>

<h3>Hanging Meat Incense</h3>
<p>— Yan Xin</p>
<p>Several strong men kowtowed in front of the Bodhisattva and made a wish.</p>
<p>The Guanwu Temple, which is usually desolate , was very lively at this time,</p>
<p>Men and women, old and young, were all there, shouting and making noise.</p>
<p>The strong men rolled out their iron-like arms, stood firm, and touched each other in pairs. At first, they were gentle, but then they bumped more and more fiercely. Biting their lower lips tightly, they were obviously trying hard, and the whole hall burst into laughter. "Hah! Don't be happy, when the time comes, I'm afraid you'll go limp!"</p>
<p>A scabby head winked and slipped out of his mouth. Before the strong men could stretch out their fists, the scabby head had already slipped out of the crowd.</p>
<p>The time finally arrived. The strong men walked behind the shrine. Everyone was still standing in front of the hall, shouting and making noise.</p>
<p>"They just want to have a midnight snack, right?"</p>
<p>"Money in the bag!"</p>
<p>"Bah! It's to repay the mother's kindness!"</p>
<p>Various arguments were posted on everyone's lips. However, the concept of "repaying the mother's kindness"</p>
<p>was hidden in everyone's heart. It is said that after hanging meat incense, the deep kindness of the mother's upbringing is considered repaid.</p>
<p>"Look! Look! They're coming out!"</p>
<p>Those standing far away shouted out first, and those who were looking around also watched closely.</p>
<p>Hooks were densely arranged on the iron-like left arm, and thin lines were tied under the hooks. The thin lines were summarized into a thick rope, and a large bronze gong was tied under the thick rope. The skin was hung down by a full three inches. There were also those who had heavy incense burners tied to them, and the skin and flesh were hanging down.</p>
<p>"Amitabha," "Thousand-Handed Guanyin." The old woman muttered and chanted Buddha's name.</p>
<p>The strong men stood solemnly in front of the Bodhisattva. Three steps forward, three steps back. Swinging the incense burner, beating the big gong. They were ready to leave. Everyone struggled to pour out of the temple gate. Shouting and making noise. The sound of the gong and the sound of people were mixed together.</p>
<p>The strong men paraded in the streets! When they encountered the Taoist altar of a family, they performed the ritual of "three steps forward and three steps back" in front of the door. The Taoist altar of the family was set up with a vegetarian platform, and idols were placed on the platform. What Guan Gong! Yue Fei! Five Tiger Generals!</p>
<p>XXX</p>
<p>Is this hanging meat incense really to repay the mother's kindness? No, no. According to a legend, this is considered an expression of national ideology! The legend is like this: "After Emperor Chongzhen of the Ming Dynasty hanged himself on Coal Hill, the Han people became slaves of the Manchu Qing. They succumbed to the power of the rulers and had to swallow their anger; if they had complaints, they had to use the topic to play out. This 'repaying the mother's kindness' is the heroic state they make of enduring pain, expressing their unwillingness to succumb. Therefore</p>
<p>, the period they hold it is in March every year, the month when Chongzhen hanged himself. What they worship are Guan,</p>
<p>Yue. Five Tiger Generals. and other national heroes 1."</p>
<p>This kind of national movement that goes deep into the people is now being banned. What exists now is the national literature of the intellectual class, and the "resistance" in the mouths of students!</p>
<h3>Eating Articles</h3>
<p>— Sheng Fu</p>
<p>It is said that Xiang Xi, who always looked down on men of letters, has now become a man of letters himself. However, up until now, I have never had the pleasure of reading his work. This is probably because I don't know what pen name he uses. I only heard from Dong Sheng that he no longer runs a mine because life is difficult, and he has to write articles for several publications to support his wife and three children. But I heard this half a year ago, and we still haven't had a chance to meet.</p>
<p>I often thought he might be writing about science. I also often paid attention, intentionally or unintentionally, to articles about science in magazines and newspapers. However, this type of writing cannot reveal a person's individuality, so I couldn't determine which of these articles was written by Xiang Xi.</p>
<p>Recently, I heard from a friend that Xiang Xi also lives in Xishi now. I wanted to visit him several times, but because we had been apart for so long, I wondered if this old friend would still recognize me. Wasn't he very down on his luck? Would he be in the mood to reminisce? These thoughts shattered my desire to visit him each time.</p>
<p>Later, I learned about Xiang Xi's recent life from Dong Sheng, which was not as bad as I had imagined. He reportedly hadn't forgotten me and also wanted to meet and talk, but because we had been apart for so long, he hesitated to visit me abruptly.</p>
<p>So, Dong Sheng and I went to visit him first.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because we had both "seen the world." The meeting was very calm. We exchanged some pleasantries and then couldn't find anything else to say. During this silent moment, I noticed a stack of manuscripts on his desk. I approached the desk, eager to see what "great work" my old friend was engaged in, but he looked embarrassed and said with a cold smile:</p>
<p>"It's very boring, just articles for making a living."</p>
<p>"You don't have to be modest. I heard you changed careers a long time ago. Your recent works must be very impressive!"</p>
<p>"Works?" He was a little annoyed and threw the stack of manuscripts at me, continuing, "You'll know everything about me after reading this."</p>
<p>I quickly stretched out the manuscript paper and saw him title it in large characters on the first line:</p>
<p>"New Year's Day First Writing." I was almost stunned because the New Year was still more than twenty days away. Why was he so impatient to write his "New Year's Day First Writing" so early?</p>
<p>"You must think I'm very boring!"</p>
<p>He smiled bitterly. "This is for a magazine in XX city. They want to print it on New Year's Day and asked me to send it a week before printing, so I had to write it in advance. Writing this kind of thing is extremely boring. I used to write it every year when I was a child under my father's supervision. But at that time, it was really just to celebrate the occasion, and I had a joyful feeling. Now, using this kind of writing to make money is a completely different story. Actually, this was beyond my expectations." He was a little melancholic.</p>
<p>What else could I say? His "great work" was certainly explained in this article. I didn't finish reading the article. I could already see the despair, sadness, and resentment in his heart. I put the manuscript in an envelope, and we were both silent.</p>
<p>At the same time, I felt ashamed. I regretted the polite greetings we exchanged when we met, which seemed to have a hint of mockery. I wonder if my old friend can understand me? Now we haven't seen each other for dozens of days. When I think of the sluggish publishing industry this year, and the increasingly narrow topics and venues for writing, I can't help but worry about this noble parent of three children. I wonder if "articles for making a living" can fill the hungry stomachs of his family of five or six?</p>
<h3>Countryside Night</h3>
<p>— Yi Hong</p>
<p>Listening to the faint temple bell ringing from afar, gently and slowly,</p>
<p>sliding across the silent, cold river;</p>
<p>beneath the cold river, emerald waves gently play a tinkling tune.</p>
<p>Look at the patch of ruddy sunset glow smeared across the western sky,</p>
<p>resembling the reflection of a fire, clearly,</p>
<p>painting the brilliance of the city.</p>
<p>Like a hideous nightmare in the dark shadows,</p>
<p>—a grove of pine trees.</p>
<p>A few refreshing breezes,</p>
<p>softly, scattering its shadows,</p>
<p>releasing waves of mournful sound.</p>
<p>A hungry dog in a deep alley barks loudly,</p>
<p>breaking the stillness of the wilderness;</p>
<p>it turns out to be</p>
<p>several lights slowly moving deep within the bamboo forest.</p>
<p>In the water-like, pure atmosphere,</p>
<p>time counts the sounds of the village night.</p>
<p>Pale moonlight bathes the sparse thatched cottages;</p>
<p>a few specks of light flicker in the sparse forest;</p>
<p>in the cold wilderness, the sound of weaving mingles with the chirping of insects.</p>
<p>People intoxicated in the city!</p>
<p>Could they imagine such a serene realm in this world?</p>
<p>Waiting for the morning rooster to stir the fields,</p>
<p>a hoe-carrying farmer slowly trudges along the ridges,</p>
<p>while city people,</p>
<p>perhaps exhausted from a night's toil,</p>
<p>are searching for the taste of dreams in sound sleep.</p>
<p>May 10th, in Hangzhou</p>
<h3>Eugenie (4)</h3>
<p>— Bai Wei</p>
<p>The complete rejection from both sides didn't discourage Xuan; he had already vowed to overcome all difficulties and keep Eugenie for life! However, Eugenie's side was different; she was thoroughly a practical woman! She didn't want to overly disobey her mother's wishes. Although she was not religious, she didn't want a religious punishment to diminish her family's prestige in the neighborhood. She knew that ordinary secular people had no way of understanding her situation. Xuan advised her to simply abandon her family, but she refused to accept this idea. She advocated a gradual approach: he and she were still young; she would get engaged to Xuan after obtaining her mother's consent and the church leader's permission. Xuan's eloquence couldn't change the girl's stubbornness! So, the matter of the engagement was temporarily put on hold. For now, at least, they were enjoying the most beautiful life possible in the world! They spent their second winter and spring together, and Eugenie was still as lovely and gentle as she was when Xuan first met her!</p>
<p>The second academic year's exams were approaching. These were the last two exams for Eugenie's undergraduate degree. Xuan panicked at the thought of the cursed summer vacation, which was relentlessly approaching, and he would have to send his Eugenie away again.</p>
<p>"Eugenie, are you coming back to study for a postgraduate degree next year?" They were sitting together on a wooden bench in the small garden, covered by the lush green elm leaves.</p>
<p>"Not necessarily. I initially only agreed with my family to complete the four undergraduate exams in two years; we didn't discuss anything about pursuing a bachelor's degree afterwards. Further postgraduate studies were not mentioned because we couldn't predict whether I could pass the four exams in two years. When I go home this time, I'll naturally discuss it with my family and come back to study for a postgraduate degree. My dear, how can I stay away from you for so long! I think I still want to return to Paris!"</p>
<p>"What if your family, to separate us, doesn't allow you to come back?" Xuan asked suspiciously.</p>
<p>"I'm also planning to bring up the marriage when I go home." She said with confidence.</p>
<p>"What if it doesn't work out?"</p>
<p>Eugenie didn't answer immediately. Xuan raised her right hand, brought it to his lips to kiss, and tears fell on her palm. "That doesn't matter! Once I reach legal adulthood, I can freely come to Paris, and my parents can no longer control me. Then I'll go to China with you. Okay?" Eugenie comforted Xuan, hugged his head, and kissed him on the forehead.</p>
<p>"We'll get married then?"</p>
<p>"That's different again. At that time, although I can freely come and go with you, it will just be like my personal travel. Marriage won't work! Think about it: once I marry you, the pastor and my family will never let me go. My father doesn't care, but my mother definitely can't stand the neighborhood's laughter. You don't know how much my mother cares about maintaining her dignity in the neighborhood."</p>
<p>"According to you, we can live together in the future, but there's no way to get married, just like now."</p>
<p>"There are ways to get married: either get the church leader's permission, or my mother dies."</p>
<p>"What a contradictory society!" Xuan sighed.</p>
<p>This issue was not raised again while Eugenie was busy with her exams. After passing the exams victoriously, she rested in Paris for a few days and then went to Berlin with Xuan for a trip. She planned to go from there to Vienna to take a ship back home.</p>

<h3>Was the "Women's National Products Year" Really a Failure?</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>We didn't need Japanese newspapers to sneer at us; we already knew that the so-called "Women's National Products Year" was just like "Down with Imperialism"—just an empty slogan that sounds good and adds to the excitement, but can't really save this critically ill China. It's not at all surprising that China's modern women reject national products and admire foreign goods because since they're modern, naturally only modern items can satisfy them. Who knew that those nosy people who are enthusiastically promoting national products would insist on holding this "Women's National Products Year" to persuade them to use national products and use the name of "patriotism" in the hope of touching their consciences. The result not only didn't help, but it also earned us ridicule from the enemy, who said: "The National Government has done its best to use all propaganda machines to promote national products, especially the slogan of the so-called Women's National Products Year, but the hoped-for results have completely vanished into thin air. Why? Since January, it's already mid-April, and the excess of imports in the first quarter of this year is 160 million yuan. According to the figures, the situation is clear: most of the imported goods are consumed in the cities, and 50-60% of them are decorations and consumer goods for the modern women's class. Therefore, although the slogan of promoting national products is being used to rally people, the women remain indifferent. No wonder the Women's National Products Year has completely failed."</p>
<p>The reason for the failure of the "Women's National Products Year" is indeed that "the women remain indifferent."</p>
<p>However, we promote national products not only to women, and even less so to modern women. Our goal is to expect all 400 million compatriots in the country to be of one heart and mind, and for everyone to take action. The reason why we designated this year as the "Women's National Products Year" was just to give the women's community a stimulus, to call them to awaken. Actually, we didn't have much intention. And we dare to believe that although our slogan for promoting national products has had very little effect, it's not true that it hasn't had any impact at all. We only need to look at the flourishing atmosphere of several national product factories and national product markets in Shanghai recently to be able to infer this. So, we believe that let them sneer as much as they want, we will still do our best to promote them. With one point of effort, we can reap one point of achievement. Based on this belief, we sincerely hope that those who are enthusiastic about the national product movement will continue to fight to achieve our ultimate goal.</p>
<p>However, if we want to promote national products, we should work hard in a down-to-earth manner to achieve results. New tricks will not work. What we should pay most attention to is the improvement and invention of national products. Improvement can make national products change from inferior to superior and compare with foreign goods. Invention can manufacture new goods and compete with foreign goods. In this way, even if national products are not promoted, there is no reason why the Chinese people would not like to use them. Have we ever heard of countries such as England, France, Germany or Japan promoting national products? However, the people of England, the United States, France, or Japan mostly like to use their own national products. It can be seen that national products are not about promotion, but about having excellent national products for the people to enjoy.</p>
<p>Finally, we still have to say something to the group of modern women in China. If China doesn't think about rejuvenating itself, the destruction of the country is an inevitable result, and the tragedy of the destruction of the country will soon be realized before our eyes. How to rejuvenate depends on the awakening of the people of the whole country, to go to the crisis together, to save the decline. Using national products is the duty of every Chinese. If you still have a little patriotism, please start from now on to do your part for the country. Just think about it, the enemy is using economic aggression to destroy our country, and on the other hand, they are making cold remarks and laughing at our people for not having patriotism. How do you feel about this? It really breaks our hearts!</p>
<h3>The Future of Chinese Women</h3>
<p>— Bo Er</p>
<p>I feel that the women's issue is one of the biggest issues in Chinese society. From a population statistics perspective, don't we have 400 million compatriots? However, in terms of gender, women account for half of the population. However, in the years of civil war, on the front lines of the artillery fire, didn't China sacrifice many, many men? In terms of physiology, let's examine it again. Women are mostly weaker than men because in a society that values men over women, all issues are centered on men. Therefore, women have gradually lost their inherent abilities. They only do minor and trivial work within the family. As a result, they are healthier than men. At least, they don't have to work as hard as men, they don't have to worry about major responsibilities in life, and they haven't been subjected to the same extreme labor as men. Therefore, the life expectancy of Chinese women is often longer than that of men. Judging from this situation, it would not be a mistake to assume that there are more women than men in China.</p>
<p>Based on this point, the women who account for most of the Chinese population are clearly a very important issue.</p>
<p>However, under this deformed social system, women are despised, oppressed, exploited, excluded, and imprisoned in the depths of the dark layer.</p>
<p>Therefore, the tragedy of women is deepening day by day. In this endless life of pain, haven't women suffered inhumane lives for thousands of years?</p>
<p>In the poem "Si Qian" in the Book of Songs, let's give an example: "When a son is born, he is laid on a bed... he is the head of the family... when a daughter is born, she is laid on the ground, she is neither good nor bad, she is only considered for food and drink, and she brings no trouble to her parents..."</p>
<p>Clearly, women are treated like weeds, thrown on the ground. In short, women are rejected and trampled on. However, on the other hand, the well-fed and well-dressed lives of some ladies and misses, who live a romantic and extravagant life, is only a phenomenon of self-degradation. We can't say how miserable they are.</p>
<p>Therefore, my argument is centered on the vast majority of working women. Their lives are unimaginably dark. They are trampled on by feudal forces and abused by men. Under these multiple oppressions, what will be the outcome of the future of Chinese women? They are being buried deeper and deeper into death!</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to destroy this unfortunate tragedy, in order to fight for "equality between men and women," in order to achieve liberation and freedom, for rights, for survival... then women must fight. We should be confident that we are "human beings," not slaves, not born to be the property of men, let alone their toys!</p>
<p>In terms of thought, we must strive to get rid of those bad and outdated ideas and develop a scientific and new era consciousness. In terms of practical practice, we must redouble our efforts to learn and strive for political, economic, educational, and technical... various rights and interests. In this way, we can move towards a bright future!</p>
<h3>End-of-May Wind</h3>
<p>— Hui Ren</p>
<p>The sky is already dark, no moon, no stars,</p>
<p>the wind blowing from the Huangpu River, so soft, no stimulation, no fragrance.</p>
<p>The pale electric lights illuminate the outline of every object, the shadows are long and thin.</p>
<p>The river water weakly strikes, the tone is unusually dull.</p>
<p>The heart is melancholy, like the night; looking at the hazy ships, thinking of home!</p>
<p>There are sweet cherries, the color is lovely red;</p>
<p>there is also the seawater with a little bitter taste, which once washed my body;</p>
<p>there are also strong eyes, strong arms;</p>
<p>there is also the strong wind in May, the air has a little fragrance;</p>
<p>also, that... I think, like in a dream.</p>
<p>The girl Ying imprinted in my mind.</p>
<p>The ginkgo tree is already full of green leaves, under the warm wind, it makes a rhythmic and poetic sound.</p>
<p>I lie flat under the tree, basking in the morning sunlight, listening to the warblers singing among the leaves, watching the clouds flying overhead: I sing, that has no rhythm, the smile is always on the lips, I am happy, in the arms of nature!</p>
<p>Suddenly there is a sharp shout from the bamboo forest in the east, I run over to look, to see what happened.</p>
<p>It is a beautiful girl lying on the ground, her skirt is torn, her face is strangely gray.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>, a trace of blood flowing on the back of her hand.</p>
<p>I gently wrapped the wound with a handkerchief, poured a cup of boiling water from the hot water bottle for her to drink; her mind gradually became clearer, her face slowly turned red, and her eyes were also moving.</p>
<p>"What's wrong, girl?" I asked softly.</p>
<p>"..." That apple-like face showed a blush, she lowered her head and massaged the wrist of that hand full of mud.</p>
<p>"What's wrong, girl?" I showed a little impatience.</p>
<p>"Fell from the tree," pointing to that tree.</p>
<p>"How did you climb the tree?"</p>
<p>"I love the bird's nest on the tree, there are eggs in it!"</p>
<p>"But how did you fall?" I asked with a little interest.</p>
<p>"There is, there is... a small green snake on that branch!" A look of panic still appeared on her face.</p>
<p>"Ha... ha... interesting, are you injured?" I couldn't help laughing.</p>
<p>She shook her head, indicating that she was not in pain, and lowered her head and laughed innocently.</p>
<p>From then on I became familiar with her, and learned that her name was Ying, that beautiful name, I gently muttered.</p>
<p>She has strong eyes, strong arms, and that arm tanned by seawater and sunlight emits a layer of bright luster.</p>
<p>We often bite cherries under the ginkgo tree, talking about distant stories; her naughty nature made me often hit the palm of her hand with a branch, then she would escape to the bamboo forest to hide and laugh, and I would chase her.</p>
<p>In this way, we spend our days in innocent</p>
<p>naughtiness.</p>
<p>I have each fallen in love without realizing it. If I don't see that naughty smiling face one day, I won't be able to do anything for a day.</p>
<p>I want to say to her: "Ying, I love you!"</p>
<p>! I also want to write her a letter to show the burning in my heart, but when I see that lively smiling face, I lose my courage, and I feel ashamed in my heart.</p>
<p>But the ruthless June gently and quietly descended into the world, and I have to go back south, back to this ruthless Shanghai.</p>
<p>"Ying, goodbye!" It's like a ball of cotton is blocking my heart.</p>
<p>"Don't forget to bring me some stories from the South!" Her eyes are still so strong, no nostalgia, no sadness.</p>
<p>"Okay, you bring me stories from your hometown as well."</p>
<p>The ship leaves the strong soil little by little, watching the shadow waving goodbye fade little by little.</p>
<p>The May wind has quietly descended into the world again, I look at the hazy ship and believe in the wind of my hometown, that intoxicating wind, take me away, to that sweet hometown!</p>
<h3>The Cause of Death of Ms. Xi Yinxia (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Wei Ci</p>
<p>From this, we can say that Ms. Gong's pain was given by society, and Ms. Gong's life was ended by herself. In the end, the responsibility for this incident still rests with Ms. Gong herself. If the social environment is no longer suitable for our life requirements, we must reject it and transform it. This is the root of revolution and the starting point of social evolution. For example, the poverty of the majority of individuals is caused by society, but the theft caused by poverty should still be the responsibility of the individual. In the current social system, it is indeed a criminal act. Even according to socialist theory, they should unite to actively seek to transform society, and should not use theft as a means to solve temporary life problems with passive individualism.</p>
<p>Ms. Gong's suicide was wrong. I hope that Ms. Gong's death will, on the one hand, enable the women's community to raise the old issue again and do a little bit to improve the status of women in social psychology, eliminate the potential of large family organizations, and eliminate the legacy of feudal ideology imposed on women. This sounds too old-fashioned and too bland, but if everyone is willing to actually experience it in new and old families, they will know how serious the abuse imposed on women by this force in society and in the family is. On the other hand, I hope that all people who are subjected to external stimuli - whether spiritual or material, which make their hearts so weak that they cannot support themselves and only think about suicide - please quickly calm down your minds and reflect on the reasons why you cannot bear oppression and pain and cannot find a way out. It is entirely because you do not have a clear understanding of things and cannot understand them thoroughly, so you cannot help yourself and do not have the courage to take responsibility for yourself. It is not that there is really no way out for you in society. If you don't believe it, please look at Gong Yinxia as an example - she blocked her own way out. (End)</p>
<h3>The Philosophy of Boxing</h3>
<p>— Bai Rong</p>
<p>When we throw a punch at someone, we can often get the following three different results:</p>
<p>(1) Knocking that person down.</p>
<p>(2) That person returns a punch and knocks you down.</p>
<p>(3) That person completely ignores you.</p>
<p>The first is sufficient to prove that you have great strength, and you can win people's praise and admiration. The second, although a failure, is at least sufficient to prove that you have considerable strength. Your punch can actually stimulate the other party and cause a reaction. Only the third one, when you punch it, it doesn't hurt or itch. The other party's indifference is enough to prove your weakness, which can be said to be the ultimate failure. Therefore, we can boldly say that those who get the third result from boxing can be said to be completely useless.</p>
<p>Knowing that punching will not produce results and retreating in the face of difficulties, although as pitiful as a paper tiger, can at least maintain appearances in front of others. Punching will reveal your true colors. If you don't punch, others will naturally have no way of knowing what your true self is like. Before your true colors are guessed by others, secretly sharpen your fists and wait for the opportunity. Once your vitality is strong and your skills are refined, swing your hand and smash a punch at the other person's vitals. Even if you don't knock them down, at least you should make them shout "Ah!" or turn around and return a punch in the same way. This is the clever way to do it.</p>
<p>In the past, some people said: "Diplomacy should be backed by military force," and also said: "Weak countries have no diplomacy." Examining the current situation, these two sentences still capture a part of the truth. Recently, the Japanese are building an airfield in Balitai, Tianjin, and our country has begun to protest again. In the past, the protesting trick seemed very familiar to us. Since China and Japan have had relations, we have been constantly doing the work of "protesting," but it is only protesting. The tense faces and waving gestures often relax because of the other party's indifference. Past history has given us profound lessons: why doesn't anyone respond to our protests? Why are other people's protests so powerful? The focus of this issue is how to... ? Being able to recognize this problem and find a solution, and taking a step back to cultivate one's own potential, is the most appropriate way for a weak person. Otherwise, protesting here and protesting there, causing no impact on others while exhausting one's own energy and depleting one's qi and blood, the result is a pitiful wait for death. That is truly a foolish person who does not understand the times.</p>
<p>Boxing is not easy. How to punch? When to punch? Who to punch? What is their vital spot? All are related to the victory or defeat of the whole situation. Has the person who wields the fist ever given this a calm and deep thought?</p>
<h3>The Biography of Frustration (5)</h3>
<p>— Wang Wo</p>
<h3>Boundless Defects</h3>
<p>— Lie Huo</p>
<p>At least, in the past and present, ideals and reality are two completely different things, which can never be verified as harmonious, but are mutually inherited and generated, phantomly separated like shadows, and always become a mystery.</p>
<p>However, some say that ideals are the mother of facts, the guide of facts. They vividly regard "people" and "environment" as similar to a sculpted stone statue, static and dead, ignoring the meaning of evolution in "movement," just like the weather of the heavens, and the magic lantern of the world, which cannot be grasped at all.</p>
<p>These people, in order to prove that their theory is true and reliable, are accustomed to taking some unsubstantiated things to make textual research, and vigorously justify their arguments. Sometimes they also seem to say it very plausibly. For example, the "Republic of China" was an ideal before the Xinhai Revolution. After the Xinhai Revolution, the "Republic of China" after all became a reality. At the beginning of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, it was not only about destroying the Qing Dynasty and restoring the Ming Dynasty, but also contained socialist ideas, such as slogans such as "rob the rich and help the poor," which can be seen from this. Even between members, they were closely cooperating with each other at that time, without any barriers, and seemed to be able to fulfill their ideals. But what happened later? When the country was about to be completed and the capital was established in Jinling, the ideal disappeared like a wisp of evening smoke. Everyone forgot his mission, and several leaders only cared about the infighting of interests, fighting openly and secretly, and the result was mutual killing, giving Zeng, Zuo, and Peng a great opportunity to dedicate their efforts. The so-called Taiping Heavenly Kingdom is like an ephemeral flower. The transience of prosperity and decline often makes historians speechless.</p>
<p>Just take the present matter, since "September 18th," "resisting Japan and saving the country" has been an ideal. Probably everyone has such an ideal, except for Zheng Laogou, who dares to risk being wrong. The rest, such as the foreign saintly old doctors who advocate "fifty years" or "ten years" before talking about "saving the country," also have such an ideal. But the fact is that a distortion occurred halfway, and everything that is displayed before our eyes is really heartbreaking.</p>
<p>Ideals can never catch up with reality!</p>
<p>This is the boundless defect in human society.</p>
<h3>A Folk Tragedy at Xifengkou</h3>
<p>— Yang Yang</p>
<p>Xifengkou, in terms of the North China terrain, is a must-contend for strategists. It is also one of the important passes of the Great Wall. I remember that both the Zhili-Fengtian wars left great records here. General Da Shu also seemed to raise the flag of mutiny in that place, and invented the style of Chinese warlords betraying their masters and colluding with the enemy. However, after the September 18th Incident, Mr. Song Zheyuan's anti-Japanese campaign, the great battle during the Great Wall, and the fierce battle at Xifengkou, the artillery fire was connected to the sky, and the flesh and blood fought each other. Especially the equipment was not sophisticated, and there was no replenishment afterwards. The soldiers endured hunger and cold, and still fought a deadly battle with the enemy. Their immortal spirit can really move the heaven and earth and make the ghosts and gods cry, and leave one of the most glorious pages in the history of the Republic of China's foreign wars, and also the one page that is somewhat satisfactory since the fall of the Northeast. It can also be seen that our country's soldiers are not completely brave in private fights, but all have no resistance behavior to the outside world. Yesterday, I occasionally read a poem by a Yuan Dynasty poet, which also describes the story of Xifengkou. According to legend, at the end of the Song Dynasty and the beginning of the Yuan Dynasty, a young soldier from Fujian joined the army outside the border and followed Genghis Khan of Yuan to fight everywhere. He had been missing for several years without any news. His father missed his son so much that he traveled around from his hometown to find his son. When he arrived at Xifengkou, he actually found him. Once the father and son met, joy turned into sorrow, and they hugged each other and cried bitterly. Unexpectedly, they both died in one cry. Probably the spirits and bodies of the father and son both contained great pain. One traveled thousands of miles with great difficulty, and the other served in the army for ten years. The sadness in their hearts and the pain in their bodies must have been tightly wrapped layer by layer. Therefore, when the goal was achieved, the pain was fixed, and they could not recover. At that time, the chief general of the young soldier discovered this tragedy and wanted to leave a memorial for his father and son. In addition to burying the bones of the two and erecting a monument to describe the event, he specially named his garrison "Xifengkou," so that future generations can understand the reason by understanding the name. However, as the years passed, I don't know how, "Feng" was changed to "Feng." The misrepresentation of place names is still a small matter. However, this loving father's love for his family is forever buried and not revealed, which is indeed a regrettable thing. There is also one regrettable thing. The names of the father and son have not been passed down. Originally, their status was too small. Chinese people in the past thought that it was completely feudalized. Because the status was too small, who would pay attention to this valuable folk tragedy? Now, the places named after events have been changed, not to mention that the graves and monuments of his father and son are naturally even more difficult to find. Fortunately, there is still a poet named Xu who did not spare his efforts and wrote a sympathetic grief, leaving such a text, which can still provide us with imagination and mourning. The poem says:</p>
<p>"The son takes off his cold clothes and strokes them heavily, who can bear to push away the food when the son is hungry? The Great Wall and the country are far away, carrying weapons, and how can we not return when we leave? When I left, the clouds came out of the northeast, and went straight out of the Yuguan Pass to cross the Liao River; the white-haired Lang left with his shadow, how could he be afraid of thousands of miles of mountains and rivers. Heaven taught them to meet here, and the father said that my son fell from the sky, smiling tired and happy to die together, who can be so infatuated! The official family has not yet finished opening the frontier, it is better to die together than to live together, the mountain clouds are vast and the wind is rustling, how many autumns do the twin tombs on the mountain head know? At that time, I couldn't bear to weep once: today, it has become thousands of years of sorrow. It's like a chaste woman turning into a stone, and she will never be alone! The cold shadow of the Qingjiang River is long and leisurely, and the travelers are gone without any news."</p>
