<p>今日華北之秩序在外表上雖有穩定之象徵而内含之危機則到處隱伏如人民生計之困苦地方稅收之减低日本逼迫之加重無一不使當局者窘於應付財政問題特其一端而已此次財長孔祥煕氏在全國財政會議閉幕之後地方苛捐雜稅將裁之際巡視華北以謀華北財政之整頓用意甚是惟將來之成績如何尙非今日所能言也</p>
<p>夫我國國力疲弊由來已久原因旣非單純治理自難立致卽如華北旣往之繁榮一則因其爲全國政治之中心再則有賴於關外及蒙一帶之榮養年來國都旣已南遷政治重心隨之移動九一八後關外商業盡操日人之手而外蒙關係之斷絕更非旦夕　事往昔山西商帮之規模今乃漸變而爲歷史上陳跡矣</p>
<p>今日華北中等城市如張北大同綏遠太原保定等莫不日趨衰落卽舊都北平之文化事業亦徒擁虛名他何待論天津商埠扼津浦北寗兩路之樞紐北洋航業之中心宜可獨步華北欣欣向榮無如當地缺乏强有力之工業經濟爲基礎僅以進出口業苟延殘喘終無以自拔於不景氣之泥潭華北之城市如此至於一般農村原不脫千百年來簡單樸素之遺風農民辛苦經年僅求溫飽但以經濟恐慌之激盪實已形成破産壯狀態卽令豐收大熟且不足以彌補宿欠不幸而蒙天災人禍更將無以爲生塘沽恊定簽訂逾年而戰區中之日本軍隊依然到處尋衅地痞惡棍且狐假虎威恣意橫行以致整個華北大有朝不保暮之勢</p>
<p>吾人深覺欲求華北財政之整頓當首謀政治局面之安定次之則爲實行苛捐雜稅之廢止前者非本文所欲論卽以後者爲言如察省政府主席宋哲元所表示現時該省財政之入不敷出者每月竟達三十餘萬元廢止苛雜以後省庫收入將减少二分之一勢將不能支持其他華北省區雖不盡如察省之窮困而大體情形則頗多相類蓋地方政府每賴苛捐雜稅以爲養兵之財源十數年來彼此傚尤巳成積重難返之勢華北民力之疲弊早臻極點而地方之開癖尙難預期假使現時地方各當局依然不知體卹民間痛苦繼續效法　昔軍閥行爲而作竭澤而漁之擧則在人民誠無以爲生在政府又安所求治所望孔財長與華北軍政領袖能一致顧全中央政府之信用尊重財政會議之决議無論如何以廢止捐稅雜稅爲能盡及應盡之義務須知苛雜之來多由養兵而擁兵過多不惟不能自衛且適足自速滅亡蓋財政旣感支绌軍需自然不足驅半饑之軍隊以與强國精兵抗其何能敵爲今之計縱不能立卽裁兵亦應毅然下一重大决心今後不再續招新兵不再補充缺額更就現有行伍人數逐漸加以編遣如是則養兵之費不難次第减少而所謂苛捐雜稅亦可不廢而自絕矣</p>

<p>减低日常用品稅率</p>
<p>已呈中央鑒核施行</p>
<p>（南京）財政當局對修訂進口規則、謂此次修訂制度、將昔年所訂之舊稅稅章酌量情形、加以增减、此爲關稅行政上應有之措施、蓋我國自關稅自主後、除各國條約未滿之一部份、不免稍受牽制外、其他任何方面、不得干涉且中日關稅互惠條約、已於去年期滿、故此次我國更訂關稅稅則、日方無反對理由、且進口稅則與出口稅則、性質相似、按照現在情形、將貨物分類劃淸、稅率加以增减、並不完全增髙、聞增稅者大部屬於奢侈品、罐頭燈泡等次之、現立法院當局對是項新稅則、甚爲重視、刻尙在縝密審查中、聞立法院對手續上或有研討之點、（二十七日專電）</p>

<p>齊藤内閣運命、雖難卜其長短然近來暗　低迷、危機四伏、預料不久將有變化、而後繼内閣、要不出於齊藤再起、宇垣組閣、與淸浦組閣等三途、至於鈴木内閣平治内閣、殆無希望可言、</p>
<p>所謂一九三六年之危險期迫在眉睫、未來之陸海軍大臣、究爲何人、實爲當前之重大問題、苟組閣大命再降於齊藤、則閣員全部、恐不至有所變動、現任軍部大臣、自亦不必更迭、不然、若齊藤引退、則問題起矣、吾人先自大將方面而加以物色、則有㈠關東軍司令官菱毅隆氏、但菱毅因有現職關係、必不轉任陸相、且就事實而言、渠非軍政家、不過一員武將而已、㈡爲軍事參議官南次郎大將、大將在若槻第二次内閣時代、曾任陸相、部内批評、亦頗不惡、然因其年邁而無果斷、恐不致再行上台、㈢軍事參議官渡邊錠太郎大將、渠與林陸相爲同期生、部内有數的戰史研究者亦爲讀書家、其薪俸之大半、供給於丸善書店、由此可知其爲篤學者、但渠於軍政方面、初無經騐、不過多擔任部隊長事、富於戰爭經騐而已、㈣爲技術部長緒方勝一、渠有金鷄勳章的戰功者、然亦僅爲技術官、不適任陸相除上述數人外、在大將級中、尙有本莊繁、本莊、現任侍從武官長、又無任陸相之資格、此外可爲陸相候補者、僅眞崎·阿部·荒木·松井·川島·五人、荒木就任陸相時、名聲甚好、但在任二年、已墮落身價不少、因其饒舌多言、爲有心者所厭惡、彼以某事稱病、然並無所病、卽去陸相之職、則下期再欲坐陸相椅　、恐不容易、其他四人中最有可能性者、爲淸浦内閣時之眞崎陸相、與宇垣内閣時之阿部陸相、眞崎甚三郎、在此非常時期中、可與荒木相匹敵、渠自第八師團長調任第一師團長後、在宇垣陸相時代、曾遠調至台灣、任司令官、迨滿州事變、閑院宮參謀總長、電請其任次長、彼卽晋京、與陸相荒木極投機、在一年半間、指導滿洲上海各種作戰、頗爲有功、故進級、爲大將、專任軍事參議官、旋因荒木辭職、代林陸相就敎育總監、彼富有包容力、冃具大野心、在議會塲上頗以敢言稱、故彼之部内、均有陸相之呼聲、惟其人指揮三軍則可、亦不得謂爲軍政家也、若論軍事參議官阿部信行、爲宇垣一系的巨星、濱口内閣時代、任宇垣之次官、昭和五年六月、因打勝軍部大臣武官專任制之鐵壁、供獻窮餘一策、代理宇垣陸相之職、故確有陸相之經騐、依理而言、其任爲大臣、應當在荒木之前、不圖内部複雜、適値宇垣系交代時期、乃改任第四師團長、旋轉任台灣軍司令官、去年六月、　始進級大將、八月依陸軍定期移動、任爲軍事參議官、彼雖無金鷄勳章、確可稱爲唯一的大將、不過以今日情形論、欲任眞正軍政家的陸相、恐尙不能列在前茅、若宇垣組織内閣、則彼自在夾袋中耳、然則次期内閣之首班、究屬何人乎、依大勢觀之、大約林銑　郎仍留原任、照憲政方面言、内閣如更迭、閣員當然辭任、但軍部大臣之留任例、如昭和二年四月成立之田中内閣、已經打破、况照現在之情勢、林銑　郎在部内恐難去任、蓋彼以人格論、在部内爲少見之德望家、能保持部内統制、與彼比肩之人材甚少、前因其弟白上問題、發生辭職卒不實現者、亦非彼之眞意、因部内之强迫、故不得不留任耳、由此可知次期之陸相、將仍屬於林也、</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<p>[P再談建設大衆</p>
<p>語文學　│答王省三君│</p>
<p>自我們發表一篇「怎樣建設大衆語文學」以後，有許多讀者向我們提出意見，比如，大衆語爲什麽是反古文，同時又是反白話的呢？大衆語的標凖語是什麽呢？我們認爲，這些問題，實有從新提出來談談之必要。</p>
<p>我們曾說，「目前的大衆語運動，是反古文的，同時，是反官僚買辦的白話的」，因爲，「大衆語之與白話，之與古文同樣是對立的東西」。這意見，在原則上，雖然沒有什麽錯誤，但說來未免有點含糊，沒有精密地劃出其間的差别，正確地指出白話與大衆語的對立的統一，以致引起讀者們的誤解，而以爲反對白話等于反對古文。</p>
<p>我們的意思並不是這樣！</p>
<p>語言文字的發展，和社會發展一樣，是有其一定的程序的。我們如果要明白大衆語與白話如何對立，及如何統一，只有從語言發展的過程中去理解。我們說，大衆語，是反白話的，這是因爲白話運動並沒有完成它自身的任務，達到「言文一致」的成功，反之，它已走上投降「文言」的危機，成爲語言文字發達的障礙，試看，現在流行的白話文│不是藍靑官話，便是變相的八股，（所謂語錄體）與大衆有非常大的距離那些冷嘲熱駡靑年作家把「丢媽」「媽媽的」寫進文學作品内的作家們，與汪懋祖之提倡古文，在反大衆語這一點上，是並無不同之處的。</p>
<p>但是，這樣說，决不是認爲··反白話等於反古文，反白話也和反古文一樣，有否認全部白話的意思。不是的　我們反對白話，是爲了進一步反對古文，爲了進一步保證獲取「言文一致」的勝利。在「五四」時代，大衆語運動是包含在白話文運動之中的。我們反對白話、並不容否認白話在整個語文運動中所成就的那一部份；它宣佈了「文言的死刑，指出了今後「語文一致」的必然性。所以，在建設大衆語的現階段，我們反對白話之離開大衆，我們却不能不批判地接受白話中那接近大衆語的一切。白話畢竟與古文不同，白話畢竟是與大衆語距離較近的東西。</p>
<p>那末，白話中有那些是我們應該接受的呢？大衆語的標凖語是什麽呢？這問題，是不能機械地回答的。</p>
<p>語言，不是靜態的，而是隨着社會生活的進展，時刻變動着的。五四時代白話文的産生，同時也就是大衆語文的出發點。在這一歷程上，在白話與大衆語對立的發展中，大衆語愈漸成長，則豪紳買辦的白話愈顯出衰弱，愈暴露出它的反動性，如果我們否認白話文中大衆語的存在及發展，我們便無異否認整個語言運動，甚至文化運動的意義。不說别的，我們試拿五四前後的白話文，與現在一般白話文相比，拿遺少們的白話文來和大衆文學作家作品來比，就可知道何者更接近於大衆。這裏所謂接近大衆，不僅指語言，冃指内容，這裏的大衆不指保守的大衆，而是前進的大衆）。這種語言文字的發展，是漸進的而不是突進的，（五四白話文運動可說是突進的）所以我們並不容易看出它的發展的形式，指出幾篇眞能作爲大衆語文學的標凖的品。</p>
<p>以此來回答什麽是大衆語的標準語的問題，是可以得出同樣正確的結論的。有些人認大衆語的標凖語應該是流行的普通話，又有些人認爲應該是輪船火車上流行的江湖語。他們均視語言爲靜止的東西，視語言發展與大衆實生活的各面無關。他們只看到了這些構成大衆語的要素，誤將某一要素作爲全體。我們現在建設大衆語文學，我們固可預設一種標凖語，但這種標凖語，並不能認爲卽是未來的大衆語，只能當作這運動的依據。大衆語是在大衆實生活中長成的。夏丐尊先生謂農婦也喊「革命」，不是大衆語，但在北伐時的江西兩湖及廣東一部份的農婦，却眞能談革命，却又不能不說是大衆語了。在目前，語言與文字，其自身還留有很大的差異，看得懂的不見得聽得懂，聽得懂的，不見得看得懂。我們採用某種語言作爲這運動的標凖語是可以的（這須語言學家和社會學家的努力）。然而，顯然的這並不是主要點，現階段建設大衆語文的主要任務，我們以爲，是··</p>
<p>㈠改進形義字使逐漸變爲拚音字，打破語文間的根本差異；</p>
<p>㈡提髙大衆生活，│文化，增進大衆語辭彙，使大衆語言，與一般文化發展趨於一致的步調。</p>
<p>關於這兩點的詳細解釋，容後再及。</p>

<p>抑兄弟對此尙有點意見、也得乘這個機會向各位說明、過去的中學所造成的學生誠然有許多是旣不能升學又無技能生産、徒爲社會上的中等遊民、使社會上增加一種浮動的力量而愈形紛擾爲補偏救弊計、所以應提倡職業敎育或生活敎育、養成學生生産技能、使其能獨立生活在消極方面、減少社會上之浮動分子、在積極方面增加社會上生産力量、這在理論和原則上、任何人都不能有異議、可是照目前中國的生産環境看來、一切生産事業均未發展、將來職業學校學生能否都有出路、亦是一個絕大的疑問、據本省二十一年度統計、全省髙中職業科畢業生總數二百一十八人、就職者除上海中學商科四十人未據報告外、其餘不過九十九人、約佔總數百分之五十六、還有百分之四十找不到職業、内中雖有少數升學而賦閒的仍不少、現在職業學校畢業生並不見多卽有此種現象、將來職業敎育擴充、畢業學生一天一天的增加、豈不又是一個最大的問題嗎、兄弟對於這一點除極力使各職業學校課程切實、訓練認眞、養成學生科學頭腦和農夫工人的身手、以合社會事業界的需求外、還要求省有各事業機關能盡量容納各職業學校畢業生、因爲以省欵養成的人才、固然　供私人企業機關使用、但如能供公家使用、更爲合算、若以省欵養成的人才不能在省有各事業機關立足、與省立學校的原意、似亦稍有違背、這是兄弟聯想到過去職業學生出路狹窄所起的一種希望、此外還有　點、也可說是兄弟因講到要限制中學的澎漲所起的一種感想、一般人都以爲中國的中等學生並不見多、據敎育部統計、中國每萬人口中、中等學生數不過十一人、與德國比較僅及五十分之一、其餘各國亦十倍或二三十倍於中國不等、可見中國的中等敎育在另一種意義上有任其自然澎漲、似不宜加以任何限制、但兄弟以爲中國在這個時候的中等學生數、絕不能拿來與各國比較、各國的初等敎育差不多已到了普及的地步、所以能够進一步謀中等敎育之普及、人類文化是無止境的、故敎育亦無止境、從前歐美各國多認四年的義務敎育卽爲已足、而成人補習敎亦只授以讀寫算最淺顯的課程、現在一般的趨勢都將義務敎育年限延長爲六年或八年、而成人補習敎育的課程、則照英國勞工敎育恊會及各大學所推廣的補習敎育、其課程標凖之髙幾與大學相等、將來大勢所趨、也許要以中等敎育爲義務敎育、中等敎育在各國勢將有完全普及的一日、又不僅每萬人口中佔若干人而已、至中國則初等敎育離普及之程途尙遠、我們今日所應努力的、是初等敎育的發展、對於中等敎育只能斟對環境的需要、逐漸擴充、到了初等敎育完全普及後、然後再進一步擴充中等敎育、决不能不顧基礎、越級與各國競賽、這種無可如何的事實、我們不能不予以承認、所以兄弟希望全省有志敎育的人士認淸這種事實從根本做起、努力發展小學敎育、不必好髙務遠動輒想辦中學、據兄弟所知、浙江私立中學的數目、占全省中學總數的百分之四十九、私立小學的數目、佔全省小學總數的百分之五十以上、江蘇私立中學、占全省中學總數百分之五十左右、而私立小學的數目、只占全省小學總數的百分之九强兩相比較、實在令我們不能不贊嘆浙江辦理私立學校人士眼光的正確、以後江蘇熱心辦私立學校的人士、頂好不要辦中學、盡量的去辦小學、這是兄弟最大的願望、想亦爲我全省人士共同的願望、完結、</p>

<p>内地農村之破産如彼，農民購買力之薄弱又如此，我工商薈萃之上海，影響所及，亦已疲隳不振，日益顯著。金融界旣以坐擁巨資，日愁出路之狹隘，國貨界亦以成品堆積，銷路不暢，有貨物呆滯之困苦。尤其不幸者，明明有專門之人才，而無從發展，羣苦英雄無用武之地。中國現象如此，惟一生路，只有實行「往内地去」主義，方足以解除目前之困苦。張公權氏旣揭櫫此主義以號於國人，最近復親往天府之四川考察游歷，亘一月，歸而大贊歎，認爲中國之富，莫四川若，而國人最有希望可闢生路之地方，又莫四川若。目下之四川人，决不再抱四川者四川人之四川一語，當然仰賴外省之資本，外省之貨物，與外省之技術，以經營此富甲寰宇之地方，不難嫓美於英美。此則眞我國貨界惟一之願望，而必思所以實現之者也，張氏又謂川省每年收入一千二百萬元，我國最富庶之江蘇，僅及其六分之一，其富可知。每年吸收之貨物，以棉紗一項，年約十二萬包，其他國貨，四川人無一不爲大主顧。故不談國貨則已，談國貨，千萬不應忘却四川。張氏力勸國貨界聯袂赴川，爲實地之觀察，作貿易上之聯絡，記者深表同情，極願國貨界領袖速行組織一四川工商考察團，親往研究，以其所得再謀貢獻，又能組織一四川國貨展覽會以引起四川人之購買力，其於國貨之進展與推廣，尤多裨益，記者甚願各廠商領袖一研究之。</p>
<p>國貨談話</p>
<h3 id="c247">官僚與國貨 <a href="#c247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— 肖白</p>
<p>在前期本刋上，不是曾有過巴玲君的一篇「國貨和妓女」嗎？他說，國貨是尊嚴的，妓女是下賤的，但，假定一個好好的婦女，她抛棄了本國的貨物而不用，反去充當洋貨推銷員，那麽簡直比妓女更爲可恥了，」因此，連累我也想到了「官僚和國貨」這一個問題，也要把他倆具有密切的關係，細細地說一說。</p>
<p>「好髙騖遠，崇慕虛榮，」這也本是全世界人類的天性，我們只要從自已歴史上的觀察，就可得到幾個考證，漢郭林宗遇雨，偶墊了他頭上戴的巾角，而時人仿效他的，竟故意也折其巾角以爲榮，且號爲「林宗巾，」曾國藩任兩江總督時，在大暑天每用粗大蒲扇以拂暑，而全署上下及南京人士，竟也無不廢去紈扇而盛用蒲扇，並且這也不獨我國爲然，卽考之歐美國家亦然，猶澺歐戰初息的時候，美總統威爾遜親赴歐洲，道出倫敦，與英后同乘一車，在倉卒之際，無意中偶摺其袂口，而不崇朝爭相摺袂以矜尙者，竟遍於全倫敦，其效力之大有如此。</p>
<p>因此我們可以深切的知道，上層階級的一舉動，其影響於我全國民衆的習尙，轉移社會的風氣，乃有這樣偉大的力量，那麽「服用國貨，拒用洋貨」，這一件事，若能經他們的極力提倡，首爲導河，以作民衆表率，其收效當然是事半功倍也，可是，實際怎樣呢！却大不合我們的理想，過去事實往往告訢我們，大批舶來的奢侈品，還是大都消耗於政界，甚者身穿洋服洋裝的官僚們，他却儘自地立在講演台上大談國貨救國，心實相背，大相逕庭，他的可恥，自較妓女們更不如了。</p>
<p>最近，蔣委員長提倡「新生活運動」，在他内容的原則裏，就規定了服用國貨這一項，也足見他重視之一斑，至經他登髙一呼後，現在各地響應的，就大有全國糜然從風的樣子，像魯省主席韓復榘，與浙省主席魯滌平，他倆對於提倡國貨的努力，自亦不愧爲民衆的表率，倘我全國政界從此盡能澈底覺悟，抱着毅力，領導民衆，切實做去，自政界中人而學界而商界，並規定新生活的國貨服裝，以及一切消費，那麽國貨前途光明，自可預料的。</p>

<p>這幾天的報章，宣傳着一個極新的名詞，就是··「國貨購買競賽」，這個競賽，是中華國貨産銷合作恊會主辦，中國國貨公司舉行的。他們的宗旨，是爲測騐國人服用國貨的熱忱，競賽的日期，是三星期六月二十四日起，七月十四日止。計分總賽·週賽·日賽三種。辦法是將各個購買中國國貨公司各部出品的發票，（特種貨與批發發票除外）滿十分者，││卽十元││卽可向競賽處登記，如果喜歡日賽者，那麽參與日賽，像第一天日賽第一名是二九九·二○分，││卽購貨二百九十九元二角││日賽第一名奬是中國國貨公司禮劵一百元，他如週賽第一名奬是中國國貨公司禮劵二百元，總賽第一名，奬是中國國貨公司禮劵五百元。</p>
<p>現在以第一天第一名、購貨二百九十九元二角得奬一百元來說，在他們是犠牲無疑的。那麽他們爲什麽肯這樣犠牲呢？也無非是鼓勵國人多買國貨，以免利權的外溢。</p>
<p>然有人說··「我一個人用不到這許多東西，也沒有這多量的購買力，雖然他們的奬額是那麽髙，於我不是依然無所補益嗎？」我就爲他的一問，下了一番研究，爲他解答··「誠然的，一個人的購買力，自覺薄弱，我以爲可以聯合你們的同事，像你們公司，不是有五百多人嗎？卽以三百人來算，夏天不可少的是汗衫·毛巾之類。││這是普通的例，││每人以一元計，則得三百元。以之日賽，卽可得禮劵一百元，一百元可兌取貨物，倘以平日購買例來說，這一百元的均分，不是例外的收入嗎？」我的朋友聽了，很欣喜的起來說道··「妙極妙極！」</p>
<p>這是合着多人購買來的來例說還有消費合作社，小資本商號，學校商店，軍隊，機關，······等處，在平日，都是要買進各種貨品，或售出，或贈與，大可乘此時機，向他們多量購買，卽有多量奬額的例外收入，這不是一個最好的機會嗎？而且日賽不勝，可參與周賽，周賽不勝，還可參與總賽，總賽不勝，得計核發票總値，可得贈品，所以他們的標語是··「競賽優勝者，得奬，競賽不勝者，得贈品。」</p>
<p>最後，我以爲他們的這次策略是上乘的，超越的，而且不怕犠牲，這種精神，是値得國人讚頌，我想雖然上海是個充滿洋氣的市塲，經過他們這樣的怒潮汹湧，一般迷夢者，多少總有一些醒覺吧！</p>

<h3 id="c249">怎樣敎育兒童們提倡國貨？ <a href="#c249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— 導</p>
<p>我相信愛倫凱女士的話··「二十世紀是兒童的世界。」但是，在兒童的世界中，亟需要兒童化的敎師去敎育他們，正像一個園丁去灌漑一朶含苞未放的玫瑰花一般，飽滿的芬芳和醉人的色澤，是需要有力的帮助，慇懃的栽培，纔會展放出他們的色和香··兒童時期的重要，於此可見一般。</p>
<p>不過，天眞的兒童，具有細微的心靈，糼稚的思想，並且最富於　倣心和强盛的記憶力，這時候，爲敎師的，如何敎育兒童納入正軌？走上正道？正是一個緊要關鍵，兒童們，大都以敎師的言行，當作活潑的圖畫，生動的電影，雋刻的文字，終朝的相處，耳濡目染，習作榜樣。</p>
<p>今年是兒童年，同時，提倡國貨的形勢，也頗逞蓬勃的現象，在這個時期中，敎師對於兒童，如果以提倡國的智識，灌輸給他們，以提倡國貨的主義，切助於他們，印象極爲深刻，關係亦復重大，要　固兒童們提倡國貨的純潔思想，要造成兒童們服用國貨的基本觀念，均繋於斯；至於做敎師們的，「怎樣敎育兒童們提倡國貨？」確是一件値得討論的問題，也是敎學上應負起的鉅大責任，我想，不外要注意到下列諸點··</p>
<p>一、要採取提倡國貨的敎材··敎育兒童的敎材，要注意於國貨的製造，國貨的介紹，國貨救國理論的闡明，國貨提倡方法的啓示，以及指引提倡服用國貨和服用洋貨仇貨的利害關係。</p>
<p>二、要敎授提倡國貨的方法··提倡服用國貨，固然貴乎一面消費，一面生産；敎學方法，也須注意手腦並用，敎學合一；平時，應多多灌輸農工業的智識給兒童，指導兒童們多做農工業品的雛型手工，尤須引領兒童們時常參觀國貨的工廠，國貨的商店，國貨陳列館，國貨展覽會等等，以廣見識。</p>
<p>三、要實施提倡國貨的訓育··訓育兒童，無論直接間接，有形無形，都可以養成兒童們服用國貨的習慣；如制服一律採用國布，文具一概購用國産，並應組織國貨的消費合作社，國貨演講團，國貨推銷隊等。</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>可是工作雖忙，倒並不會有過出菜　延，或碗碟倒置的失誤發生過。讀者别小看了他們！他們的動作眞有些軍　化呢！一到生火的時候，五十個丙廚夫便一起動起手來，因爲各人的手法都是相等的，所以爐子裏的煤球也總是在同一個時候生旺，而那一截臨時裝上去的短烟囱，也連帶的在同一個時候被折卸下來了；最好看的是當那五十個丙廚夫同時彎下了身子，各用着一柄葵扇，一揮一揮地在煽動，這情形眞像舢板船上的船夫的動作一般的整齊，一般的刻板。</p>
<p>這些廚夫雖然在地位上有甲，乙，丙之分，可是他們的服裝倒是一律平等的；他們都打扮得像宮裏的太監一樣，不過在衣袖上，多加一個白布的套子。所以在這四輛權充御膳房的車子裏，色調也跟别輛車子上同樣的燦爛奪目。</p>
<p>從前時代的人，無論貧富貴賤，對於廚房的淸潔，都不很注意的；太后却不然，在宮裏頭的時候，往往親自上御膳房去察看，因此那裏是永遠收拾得非常潔凈的。而這一次在火車上臨時裝點成的這個御膳房，地位雖不大，淸潔還是十分注意。我敢說我從不曾見過這樣潔凈的廚房，連那地板也是擦得一些塵垢都沒有，差不多可以讓人家把它吃下去了。</p>
<p>每天有兩餐是規定的「正餐」，在這兩次的正餐上便得照着規矩，把那一百碗菜齊齊整的端上來了。除掉這兩次正餐之外，還有兩次的小吃；旣稱小吃，當然不會再像正餐一般的富麗了，可是皇太后總是不肯過分隨便的，所以每次的小吃，至少也有二十碗菜，平常總在四五十碗左右。（六九）</p>

<p>— 胡沉舟</p>
<p>敝小長方形的窩兒朝北開着兩個大小窗子。前面是那邊兒三層樓大洋房的主人的網球場，它養着大夥兒的草蚊子。每天的夜裏，千千萬萬的飛將軍殺到我的房子裏來。小子的不似他們的那麽地裝着「鐵絲網」，於是，我便被它們團團地包圍起來！它們嗡嗡地呐喊着，殺得我整個的身子上沒有一塊兒完全换的皮膚··坐着不好，站着也不好；稿子寫不了。想着皮日休的那首「蚊子」··「隱隱聚若雷，潛膚不知足；皇天若不平，微物敎食肉。貧士無絳紗，忍苦臥茅屋，何事覓膏腴，腹無太倉粟」！我就愈厭惡它們！</p>
<p>記得明朝裏的那位自號天台生的方孝孺，曾經做了篇兒··「蚊對」。他描寫那些蚊子··「······如螘如蠅，利嘴飫腹，充赤圓紅······」他說蚊子和蠅兒一樣大，許這正是跟一般的文人們的一樣的「誇大狂」；我們且不要去管它。你瞧，他却借着他的童子的話语，講出一番大道理來··「······且物之食於人，人之食於物，異類也，猶可言也；而蚊且猶畏謹恐懼，白畫不敢露其形，瞰人之不見，乘人之困怠，而後有求焉。今有同類者，啜粟而飲湯同也，畜妻而育子同也，衣冠儀貎，無不同也，白畫儼然乘其同類之間而陵之，吮其膏而醢其腦，使其餓，踣於草野，流離於道路，呼天之聲相接也，而且無恤之者；······」</p>
<p>唉，照這麽說來，人還比不上蚊子，我又爲什麽要厭惡它們呢！</p>

<p>東北義勇軍總司令王德林部參謀長賈鳴周君，奉命南來，辦理所部將領眷屬善後事宜，余以友人招，遇之席次。賈君爲人溫文雅爾，吐屬雋妙，不類武人。酒半，縱談義軍抗日情况，慷慨悲壯，可歌可泣，使人愛國之念，油然而生。夫君人不聞抗日之聲久矣，各報於義軍消息，又鮮登載，對於義勇軍三字，亦幾淡焉若忘，誰復思及萬里外尙有若干熱血志士，日與日寇浴血死戰，以冀爲祖國收回失土邪？賈君談某次其所部以焚辣椒却敵飛機，其事甚趣。蓋敵之勝於我者，恃其有多量之飛機與大砲，初非以其士卒之善戰也。義軍多伏深山窮壑間，作散兵綫，卽懼爲飛機所乘耳，某日，王部義軍數百人，適羣成集，不期大隊敵機驟至，已爲偵知，此時一髪千鈞，其危險殆無倫此，忽有人於萬急之中，竟發奇想，令共採集辣椒無數，使成一大堆，擧火焚之，頃刻烟燄瀰天，辣氣四佈，此擧爲敵所不料，機中人聞之，無不觸鼻出涕不能忍，咸大驚駕機而逸，圍遂得解，然終不審義軍所放何物。賈君語時，圍座聞之，無不大笑。時軍事家前輩蔣百里先生亦在座，不覺莞爾曰··「是眞可謂土製毒瓦斯矣。」</p>
<p>據友人言，留滬之東北抗日將領眷屬中，頗多髙級軍事長官之夫人，若在關内，則悉係坐汽車，吃大菜，萬人趨奉之闊太太也，徒以其丈夫之血太熱，勉棄骨肉，不顧一切，甘與敵寇作殊死戰，遂致流落異地，貧無所歸，僅恃慈善團體之救濟，勉强度日，其情况乃一如難民。且北望鄕關，故園已淪異族，而　　有些人用耳朵聽收音機有些人則用双脚來欣賞亦菴數千里外之丈夫則猶在槍林彈雨中討生活，已作春閨夢裏人者，當亦不乏其人。此種况味，在局外人設身處地，尙復難堪，矧躬歷其境者乎？</p>

<p>第三十一回三次交鋒白衣衝雪陣全營殉國赤眼入槍林　　可是在昨日第一次作戰的時候，寳芳不但是把這道險要置之不顧，而且臨時還把殷得仁一連人，由城外調進堡子裏去。這種作戰的法子，分明是表示着兵力單薄，不敢求進。昨天敵人來攻這堡城的時候，也以爲不過兩條路。十之七八，放上幾槍，就把中國人嚇跑了。十之一二，中國人會在險要的地方，先來堵上。及至打了一晚，守軍却是守城硬幹敵人出於意料之外。他們共同也不過五六人，其中有三百人，是收編的土匪，後面用機關槍比着，硬逼了他們打前敵。打了一夜，可憐這三百名被逼送死的漢奸，去了十之八九，天色又快亮了，敵人怕現出了形跡，因之退走了。不過這樣一來，敵人也就看透了寳芳這一營人，談不到什麽戰略與戰術，只是死守着那個寨子而已。到了這日，他們根據昨日的情形，繼續他們的戰略。覺得北門地勢更平坦些，還是應當繞出夾溝，去攻擊北門。在他們這個藐視中國兵的態度中，趙自强已經就帶了他的弟兄們，全數到了山溝裏了。他們彷彿都是舊式的孝子，由帽子一順的下來，直到鞋子爲止，都是白色的。就是他們的機關槍，也用一條白布，在上面罩着。口外的雪，只要下到地上，除了交來年春暖，永久是不會融化的。這夾溝裏是太陽不常光臨的所在，而大風吹着積雪，又容易漩落到這裏，所以這裏的積雪，那就格外的深。（四二○）</p>

<p>在現代矛盾的社會中，富人儘可裝着窮人的樣子。衣服破舊些，也不妨，而且還有許多益處。㈠裝了窮，免得綁匪宵小們的覬覦。㈡可以免告貸，少破鈔。一般不知底蘊的窮朋友見了，還當你是同志。自然望而却步，另請髙明。㈢只要有錢，自有人來捧你。裝了窮，會有許多人稱贊你，說你是「儉德可風。」從前莊子說「大智若愚，大巧若拙。」我來改一下，呌做「大肥若瘦，大富若貧。」這便是富人處世之道！</p>
<p>但窮人倒不可不擺了出富人的風度··你若是職位髙低，手頭拮据，就是家無隔日糧。那外表却不可不考究，衣服却不可不漂亮。否則你衣衫襤褸，任你是「學富五車，才具八斗。」人家終瞧你不起。甚至白眼相加，駡你是窮鬼。出門訪友，要「所如輒阻，」以閉門羹相餉。連你的事業，也要蒙重大的影響。「只重衣衫不重人，」究是　撲不破的話。至於你若是個「小白臉，」要想在脂粉隊中追逐。那裝飾上面，更不可不研究。一套摩登西裝，是少不來的。自然會有異性，給你以靑睞。「窮人裝富富人裝窮，」這便是「衣的哲學」。</p>

<p>——幾段蘇州的橫剖面——</p>
<p>難爲了名流</p>
<p>自從樸學大師　太炎先生在錦帆涇上，買屋居住，做了洋房寓公，蘇州一班景仰大師的名流，或者大師的門弟子們，就有事可爲了。髙山在望，景仰有道，不是前往就敎，定是設筵洗塵，大師寓蘇，原爲了趨避滬上塵囂，可是到蘇以後，却座上客上滿，盃中茶不空；就是那架連夜趕裝的電話機，也成日價鈴鈴作聲，竟使大師避囂的志願，大大的感到不易達到。前天大師又應門弟子的邀請，赴宴浪滄雅集，酒到半酣，主人卽席徵詩，爲盛會留一不朽紀念，大師原是名家，四句古詩，一揮而就，可是陪座名流，却大大感到爲難了！做呢，旣有珠玉在前，當然寫不出什麽絕妙好詞，不做呢，又難却主人雅意，一時席間名流，大有坐不安席之概！嗡聲四起，杯肴寂然。但到了明天。這盛會雅集的新聞，和大師的絕妙好詞，又煌煌刋載報紙，以彰蘇州的文化！</p>
<p>「蝕骨銷魂」的交涉</p>
<p>在這不景氣的年頭，到了這五荒六月；一般商業，更露骨表演出不景氣的景象！尤其是空心飯的遊戲事業。蘇州的二家京戲館，城内城外，已先後停演，那影戲院也生意淸淡，不得不拉些戨舞團來把肉感吸引顧客，在報紙廣告間刋載着「一絲不掛」的欺人字句；其實在公共娛樂審查會與公安局視察之下，眞眞女人的一絲不掛决不會發見在蘇州戲院中或銀幕上的。前天可是却引出交涉來了，某影戲院在萬花團的影片廣告上，刋了「蝕骨銷魂」，那知這句句兒，引起了公安局長的注意，特地差巡官前往戲院調查，究竟如何蝕骨銷魂？於是因局長的一番交涉，「蝕骨銷魂」這四個在字，就不再映入我們的眼簾。</p>
<p>送往迎來有文章</p>
<p>在新官上任，舊官下台的當兒，一班地方聞人，當方邑紳，免不了設筵歡叙，一方面替舊官送行，送一個臨去秋波；一方面爲新官洗塵，表一下歡迎熱忱，以便此後進身有道。這是各地通例，而蘇州更是上下相孚，民情素洽的地方；所以在這幾天，縣長和公安局長同時更迭的當兒，一班社會上的聞人少不得大擺迎新送舊的盛大筵席。前天留園的迎送宴上，某報主筆特地印了一份爲縣長鄒斅公先生表彰德政的文章，那潔白的紙上，有銅版，有頌詞，印刷得富麗堂皇，而那篇文章，也引今據古，文白兼有；可是恭維得太過份了，未免爲識者齒冷，於是引起了外界的反應，將那篇文章，做了幾段註釋，好好一篇恭維得體的文章，竟變做了咒詛文字。某主筆弄巧成絀，表示異常的懊喪。</p>
<p>應時食品快朶顧</p>
<p>在端陽前後時鮮的食物，是有得吃了，尤其是時鮮水菓。靑的梅子，黃的杏子和枇杷，黑的荔枝和楊梅，加着紅的金山蘋果，赭的美國蜜橘，眞是五色燦璀，瞧着不由人不引起食慾。蘇州土産的水果，楊梅和枇杷大宗，以光福的窑上，和太湖中洞庭西山出産的最爲有名。菜肴中鰣魚雖已過時，而鮮荷葉已亭亭透水，那荷葉包的粉蒸鷄肉，鮮肥淸香，别有異味，興蠟了醬油同是時鮮佳品。</p>

<h3 id="c282">大衆語問題討論的現階段及以後 <a href="#c282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— 傅東華</p>
<p>近來汪懋祖和吳研因兩位先生關於文言白話的爭論，（單說在上海方面）曾經引起兩種反應··㈠是担憂文言文的復興，因而感覺到對這傾向有提出嚴重抗議的必要；㈡是連帶感覺到五四的「白話」的先天病（雖然這種感覺並不等到現在纔有），及須有另外一種較健全的文學用語起來代替它的必要。這另外一種用語，爲要對五四的「白話」表示不同，及爲以後關於它的建設問題便利討論起見，曾得一部分人的同意，給它暫時起一個名字，呌做「大衆語」。</p>
<p>直到現在爲止，參加這問題的討論的，似乎對於㈠點都不大重視。稜磨先生在「文言的前途」一文裏說··「我斷言這抗議是無效的。」確實，在汪懋祖先生所反覆申說的「社會需要」不住地在替文言文打强心針的現在，這抗議能發生多大效果呢？因爲汪先生對於白話文的抗議也原不是「無病呻吟」啊。他看看許多人學英語，都只爲預備走進大英「寫字間」，那末學國文的目的除預備進中國「寫字間」還有什麽呢？而現在的中國「寫字間」，無論官辦，商辦，或者官商合辦，都只要文言不要白話，於是汪先生不得不替靑年們擔憂了。是的，在目前的中國，生活迫得人們不得不「見人講人話，見鬼講鬼話。」（這里「人話」和「鬼話」都照劉大白先生所解釋的用例。）典型的紅人們，大都拿起白粉條來，就能在黑板上寫「白」的「話」，一旦抛下白粉條，搖起葉聖陶先生說的那把鵝毛扇，就又能拿起也是毛做的筆，在紅格紙上「等因奉此」了││只有這樣的人</p>
<p>們才會發跡。所以汪先生擔憂文言文的墮落並非無故。但可惜現在的靑年們未必││也不容││人人都打算進「寫字間」去發跡，因而汪先生的美意未必會普遍地被接受，那末稜磨先生說的「現在對白話文無須擔憂」那句話，又是千眞萬確的了。</p>
<p>不過稜磨先生對於他自已提出的「白話文被利用後是不是另有可擔憂處」一個問題，只簡單地給它一個「不見得有」的答案，似乎還嫌太大意一點。因爲話跟話雖然像耳耶先生說的自然會得「分家」，（見六月二十日「動向」發表的「話與話底分家」）但若不經一個會計師或者律師之類替它們分一分淸楚，難免要出起毛病來。所以現在把「文言文」和「白話文」的問題再提出來討論，原要算是「五四時代剩下來的文章」（也是耳耶先生的話），至於把「白話文」和「大衆語」應該怎樣分家的問題來討論，應該不至於是「倒霉透」的事情吧？</p>
<p>到現在爲止，對於「大衆語」這個名詞，還不曾有人提出異議，但也不曾有人加强這個名詞的重要性，至多把它當作「白話文」的同義語罷了，例如龍貢公先生的「再進一步」文中（見六月二十五日「動向」），有一處在「白話文」三字底下用括弧括着「大衆語」和「活語」，像是這三個名詞是沒有分别的。其實龍先生要「再進一步」去討論的問題，就是耳耶先生所說的「話跟話底分家」的問題，所以同「白話文」分了家的另一種用語，似乎有先給它一個名字的必要。</p>
<p>不過一個名字常要被人給與不同的内容，因而龍先生的「再進一步」的需求，又是很自然而且必要的了。到現在爲止。給與「大衆語」的解說已有了下面幾種··</p>
<p>㈠「大衆說得出，聽得懂，看得明白的語言文字。」（陳子展）</p>
<p>㈡「只提出說，聽，看三樣來做標準，我想是不够的，寫也一定要顧到。」（陳望道）</p>
<p>㈢「爲尊重大衆利益起見，一切文字都該話文合一。」（樂嗣炳）</p>
<p>㈣「大衆語不是什麽人創造出來的，而是隨着大衆生活的進展而進展的東西。」（申報讀書問答）</p>
<p>㈤「應該解釋作代表大衆意識的語言。」（胡愈之）</p>
<p>但是因爲「大衆」和「大衆意識」這兩個名詞本身太富有彈性，所以關於實際建設的討論上仍舊要發生困難，例如都市大衆「說得出，聽得懂」的語言，農村大衆未必「說得出，聽得懂」；又如一部分落後的農村大衆對於「眞命天子」出現的希望，能不能不算它「大衆意識」？因此，大衆語是不可聽憑它自然發生和進展，完全不加一點人工的「創造」和促進？如果我們對於最後這一個問題的答案是肯定的，那末現在這許多討論就都沒有意義了。　　故從這問題討論的現階段的</p>
<p>情形看起來，我們只能够把握住下面幾個要點··</p>
<p>㈠「大衆」是跟一切特殊的個人或特殊的羣││從皇帝到買辦││對立的名詞，故一切特殊的個人或特殊的羣的特殊用語，無論是口頭的或筆頭的，都不是大衆語。文言文自從專作筆頭用語用的時候起，就全部是特殊的羣的特殊用語，故全部文言文都不是大衆語。「白話文」因它只拿「白」不「白」做標凖，無法防衛自已不被特殊的羣拿去利用，故「白話文」不必就是大衆語。</p>
<p>㈡「大衆語」一面要向大衆去學習，一面也要大衆來學習，所以它的進展至少得要一點人工的帮助，猶之歷史的進展需要人工帮助一樣，例如「肺病」，最落後的大衆呌做、「野貓迷」（神話的），次落後的大衆呌做「虛病」（玄學的），標準的大衆語語彙裏就應該不容有後面這兩個名詞的存在，不管它們是怎樣的「白」，怎樣的「活」。（至於描寫大衆知識落後的小說，當然在例外。）</p>
<p>㈢因上面第二項的理由，目前要「話文合一」是辦不到的（胡愈之先生已經說過），所以「大衆要聽得懂」這個標凖，只好暫時讓步一點給龍先生所主張的「精密正確」的標凖，（例如北平話「汽車」呌「電車」，「留聲機」呌「話匣子」，大衆語語彙裏都應該改正。）換了話說，只好暫時把「大衆」的範圍縮小起來。說得再具體些，可假定拿現在髙級小學的敎育程度做我們的大衆語的標凖。至對於比這程度更低的及文盲大衆，當然還得再遷就些。就如對兒童說話有時不用代名詞，而沒有代名詞的話究竟不能算是標凖語。</p>
<p>以後呢，我們希望對於這個問題能够繼續有人像龍貢公先生那樣「再進一步」，「又進一步」，「更進一步」的討論下去，逐步的把實際問題提出來解决，並且實行。卽使我們的抗議果眞無效，至少在文學的領域裏應得先做一番「堅壁淸野」的工作。</p>
<p>最後，我們不可忘記，現在參加這個討論的人們，從某一義講時，也未嘗不可算是「特殊的羣」，那末我們的這種打算是不是合於眞正的大衆的需要，那就只有眞正的大衆自已纔能判斷。</p>
<h3 id="c283">淄博印象 <a href="#c283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— 羅王</p>
<p>㈢礦山旁的老頭子</p>
<p>「靠山吃山，靠水吃水。」靠礦的人，當然也就只好吃礦了。但有的吃的很肥滿；有的吃的很苦。　　當淄川礦井剛開時候，有一個提花生藍子的大漢，天天在礦山一帶賣花生；後來礦工漸多，生意漸好，由籃子變成攤子；等到礦中煤炭實行包銷制度時，他便大膽地承包了一　煤，不到兩年，竟發了幾十萬大財。</p>
<p>這位「大漢富翁」並不識字，但是如今的氣概和談吐，誰也想不到他當年的出身。</p>
<p>可是他還能不忘從前用血汗助他的礦工們，所以特别施惠於工人，有借貸的，有疾病的，他無不帮助。他又憐憫礦工們中有不幸慘死而無家屬的，特爲買下一大塊義塚地埋葬。他是一個「老頭子」，工人們在「帮」的也特多，於是他成了大荒地的商會會長，幾千礦工的主宰。山東省政府還替他立一塊「惠及民間」的碑。</p>
<p>此外，在博山，靠運煤而發財，由礦工升爲財主的，遠大有人在。</p>
<p>㈣抬神隊的嘆息</p>
<p>當我們參觀大荒地煤礦的時候，我們先看到的是日本人的住屋和園林，櫻花開放了，然而還存在着日本的風情。</p>
<p>有一座墓地，栽着整齊的松柏，形成一條寛闊的墓道。沿墓道而上，正中壁立着一個圓錐形的祭塔，上面寫着「供養塔」三個大字，這塔下便是埋藏日本死人骨灰的所在。塔旁有一亭，内懸一鐘，如古寺。另一屋以士敏土砌成者初供神像，建立之時正革命軍底定山東之初，革命最髙潮的時期！因此，一班黨部的抬神隊乘着黑夜把那些神像打得一乾二淨！如今門已封閉起來，無神居住了！</p>
<p>可是在其他各縣，近來是迷信復興了。我們依據道聽途說，頗得了一點眞消息。</p>
<p>當革命氣勢很盛的時期，山東某縣的抬神隊進行他們底工作非常順利！後來一班善男信女，要求自動地挪移神像，封閉在城外的一室，不必毁壞，抬神隊允許了，於是一班迷信男女，搬神歸庫，臨封門時，口中念念有詞，大約是說··「諸位苦薩，請您老人家暫時屈居這裏，這也是一種災難，將來我們總要替你老人家報仇的！」</p>
<p>果然，某縣在民國二十年，因迭遭災害，羣說是侮神所致，所以善男信女聯合要求當局，請神歸位！當局准計，他們就重新修廟迎神，香火重興，比前盛過三四倍，而迷信所費，不下數十萬元！</p>
<p>從這神道的復興，反證着時代的倒轉！</p>
<h3 id="c284">倒提 <a href="#c284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— 公汗</p>
<p>西洋的慈善家是怕看虐待動物的，倒提着鷄鴨走過租界就要辦。所謂辦，雖然也不過是罰錢，只要捨得出錢，出還可以倒提一下，然而究竟是辦了。於是有幾位華人便大鳴不平，以爲西洋人優待動物，虐待華人，至於比不上鷄鴨。</p>
<p>這其實是誤解了西洋人。他們鄙夷我們，是的確的，但並未放在動物之下。自然，鷄鴨這</p>
<p>東西，無論如何，總不過送進廚房，做成大菜而已，卽順提也何補於歸根結蒂的運命。然而牠不能言語，不會抵抗，又何必加以無益的虐待呢？西洋人是什麽都講有益的。我們的古人，人民的「倒懸」之苦是想到的了，而且也實在形容得切帖，不過還沒有察出鷄鴨的倒提之災來，然而對於什麽「生刲驢肉」「活烤鵝掌」這些無聊的殘虐，却早經在文章裏加以攻擊了。這種心思，是東西之所同具的。</p>
<p>但對於人的心思，却似乎有些不同。人能組織，能反抗，能爲奴，也能爲主，不肯努力，固然可以永淪爲輿臺，自由解放，便能够獲得彼此的平等，那運命是並不一定終於送進廚房，做成大菜的。愈下劣者，愈得主人的愛憐，所以西崽打叭兒，則西崽被斥，平人忤西崽，則平人獲咎，租界上並無禁止苛待華人的規律，正因爲我們該自有力量，自有本領，和鷄鴨絕不相同的緣故。</p>
<p>然而我們從古典裏，聽熟了仁人義士，來解倒懸的胡說了，直到現在，還不免總在想從天上或什麽髙處遠處掉下一點恩典來，其甚者竟以爲「莫作亂離人，寗爲太平犬」，不妨變狗，而合羣改革是不肯的。自歎不如租界的鷄鴨者，也正有這氣味。</p>
<p>這類的人物一多，倒是大家要被倒懸的，而且雖在送往廚房的時候，也無人暫時解救。這就因爲我們究竟是人，然而是沒出息的人换緣故。</p>

<p>— 匈牙利·沛妥斐著施詠沂·譯</p>
<p>幾天之後，在那個發生這件事的小村莊上的人們，所講談着的差不多都是關於安德羅夫人和她的侄兒卡爾私奔的事情。</p>
<p>『這樣對付這個老　子是對的！他爲什麽要和一個這樣年輕貎美的女子結婚呢？』</p>
<p>『這對於我眞困難了！我不能够解决這個問題。或許因爲他們彼此相愛着吧。』</p>
<p>『實在的││我猜想。』</p>
<p>『不過我却很對不起那老頭兒。要是他因此而憂愁死了，我是一點也不會覺得吃驚的。』</p>
<p>『可憐的人！』</p>
<p>『這不幸的醜事││』</p>
<p>在這些日子，諸如此類的談話是在這小村莊裏很普通的事情，而這時卡爾和他的美麗而年輕的叔母已經在披斯相會了。他們的馬車剛要到旅館門口，同時却另外有一輛車子從那裏駛走。</p>
<p>『啊！』安娜夫人很恐慌的尖聲喊着。</p>
<p>『我希望他失去他的視覺，』卡爾暗自想着，急急地向那輛車子的方向望了一望。他們兩人便拿大衣將自已好好的裏起來。看見他們的那個人就是他們家鄕的商人。</p>
<p>『他不會認識我們的。』當他們走進他們旅館裏的房間，卡爾擔保地說。『要是他認識，他一定會招呼我們的。』</p>
<p>『謝謝天，他不會認識我們！』</p>

<h3 id="c286">歷史固會重現的嗎？ <a href="#c286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— 家爲</p>
<p>││「文言」與「白話」的論戰的再演││</p>
<p>「五四」到今日，時間是離開了這麽久。而「文言」與「白話」的論戰，那時本早就定下了「勝負」。但是時到今日，竟然又有人在提倡「文言文」，而喊出了「文言復興」的口號來了。這樣，可就有人說是，這個「舊賬」又將重翻了。</p>
<p>不錯，論戰是固然要再演的，可是，這是不是歷史的重現呢？</p>
<p>不，不，歷史决不會是重現的；然而，由於人類的「蠢愚」，偏要去重現着歷史！</p>
<p>誰都得認識，「五四」時的决戰，是在於資本主義的直侵到中國，固有的封建制度的本身，因此發生了動搖。同時，由於那時社會的客觀的條件的需要，必得推翻死話的「文言文」，而來創出了「語錄體」但那時，祇由一般純粹的資本主義之下的智識份子與資産階級來與封建制度下的土的階級，封建遺老們作戰。本來，不論那時的「勝負」怎樣决定，可是，由於客觀的歷史條件所决，在封建制度的日趨崩潰時，牠自身的社會意識的樣誌的「文言文」，是必然也得隨着沒落下去的。</p>
<p>可是，在於人類的「蠢愚」，到今日竟有人想來重現想歷史了！</p>
<p>確然，今日的封建殘餘是尙有力地深潛在現社會的各階層，因此而「文言復興」的浪聲，當然不免有隨着展開之勢。</p>
<p>本來，時代是不斷的在向前進，而社會意識也就得不息地在變動，演進。可是，若被人類的强力有意加以阻撓與壓迫，社會進行的停頓，甚至開起倒車來，都是可能的事。所以，要社會得前進，變善，就必需要來對這種勢力，作强有力的暴露與攻擊。同時，我們就必得先注意··文和語，是每一個社會意識的標誌，牠們隨着社會意識的改進而改進。所以，在於我們現階段的社會意識的需要，吾們是絕端要不得，也來重現那「五四」時代的歷史，以一般智識階級與資産階級的「洋八股」底「白話文，」來與現階段「古文復興」的死的「文言文」對敵；吾們須要更進一步，隨着社會意識的演進與大衆的需要；我們須得來建設與提倡「大衆語」向死了的「文言文」作戰，同時，也得向「洋八股」的「白話文」進攻！</p>
<p>歷史决不重現的，然而由人類的「蠢愚」，偏來重現歷史，吾們要社會改進，並得縮短牠的行程，就非向這所有想重現歷史「倒車」行爲進攻，作戰不可││。</p>

<p>— 璇伶</p>
<p>那是一個初夏的晚上，望日的前一夜，小球似的月亮雖沒有像中秋節時那麽的皎潔可愛，空中却找不見半朶雲障，虵赤裸裸地袒露在神秘的太空中。遠望一片蒼黃色的田隴，似乎沒有邊際，孤零的村落浮在黃色的稻田上，隱約零星的燈火從林中射來。我同珍划着一葉扁舟在小河裏夜遊。</p>
<p>漿打破了平靜的水面，起一層水沫，發出琤琮的響聲，接着槳的起處是一個個的漩渦兒，這邊那邊起幾輪波紋，漸漸展大開來，直到遠遠的逍逝了爲止。微風徐徐的吹動，岸邊一縷縷的柳綠在水面上拂舞，河旁的水草隨風顫搖着，瑟瑟地發響。</p>
<p>把小舟划到廣闊的河面，我停住了槳，任牠在水中飄盪。珍把這情景來比西子湖的夜遊，可憾的是水面上少了起伏倒映的山影。我們浴在淸幽的月光中，洗淨了汚俗的胸懷，我幾乎忘掉是在人間，四周靜悄悄地，沒有一些兒聲息；偶然傳來遠處農家的幾陣狗吠聲。從衣袋裏摸出我的哈莫尼加，在寂靜的田野間開始奏出抑揚的音律，珍也不知哼些什麽，相和我的琴曲，我們眞覺得是進入了仙境。</p>
<p>河的那端來了兩隻拉　的歸航之船，船裏亮着紅殷殷的燈光，艙蓬中有女人和孩子的說聲。本來像鏡平般的水面，照映在水裏的岸旁景物，這末一來立刻動亂了，水面的月兒變成好幾個大大小小的連在一綫，又慢慢的一動合攏了變做一個。遠遠的還聽得啷咕的搖櫓聲，以至於隱約的聽不淸。空氣漸復又悄靜起來，珍也默然無聲，在吟味美的詩意。夜深了，帶着幾分凉意，划着小舟悄悄地回來。</p>

<p>— 靜波</p>
<p>在一個暑天的晚上，歸家途中已是電燈齊明了。一路經過了幾家三等小飯館，都是早前去吃過飯的，但是此刻不想踏進去。是餓了不想吃呢，還是不覺得餓呢？都不是的。荷包裏只有五枚銅元和兩毛小洋了，今晚一次吃光了，明天的午餐和晚餐喝風嗎？你也許要問我還忘記算上明天早晨的點心吧，朋友，你不懂今天的知識分子的經濟學，早晨點心還要留待中華民族復興以後才能列入豫算哩。</p>
<p>又一家小麵店從我身旁退後去了。買十二個銅元的陽春麵吃好呢，買九個銅元的窩窩頭回家吃好呢？疑難還未解决而麵店與我之間的距離已經很遠了。回頭去吃麵也不必，前去再看有無窩窩頭吧。倒霉，已經走到紳士住宅區，賣窩窩頭的瞎了眼睛也不會到這些地方來開店的。再向回家的方面移動吧</p>
<p>陽春麵店就在目前了。兩毛小洋換成銅元再說，省得麵店夥計說角子不好。滿手抓着銅元，呌聲『煮碗陽春麵！』一碗分量眞不少，今晚問題解决得還不錯。買包香烟回去看書罷。</p>
<p>次日早晨再看那一本參考書，研究的問題還不够形成一個完整的輪廓或慨念，慢慢來，出去，好幾條冷靜幽雅的馬路都在脚下退後去了，太陽同我麻煩的機會多起來。向閙市走吧，快些解决午餐問題，好到公共閱覽室，時間不早了。三位小勞動者已經佔據了第一桌，吵閙得起勁，是麵店的主顧哪。夥計們頂内行，知道在吃中飯時不去進飯館而來吃麵，不是窮光蛋是什麽呢？眞的，這三位和我，衣服雖不同，一般逃不出夥計們的眼睛的。吃了就走，燃好香烟，啣在口内，信步走出。路旁樹葉放出一些蔭影不時來給我遮陽光，總算是對我的同情。『扞光地栗！幾鈿一串？』我問她。『四十鈿』。『念鈿』。『三十鈿哪』</p>
<p>。『不要』。這樣便宜還不要嗎？不是不</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>要，心裏一想到有時陽春麵賣十三個銅元一碗，若是用去三枚，只餘十二枚，碰到特價陽春麵怎樣辦呢？還是不買的好，閱覽室快到了。</p>

<p>— 洪奔</p>
<p>中國人多是文弱之姿，一向是以「白面書生」爲尊，好一幅民族積弱的說明圖！四千餘年來的歷史，其存在，其延續，彷彿應完全歸功於所謂讀書也者。而今的不提，過去却的確是如此的，人一成了讀書人，其生命就特别來得髙貴，因爲他的生命的髙貴，在社會上就必然具有着特殊的權威。</p>
<p>然而這所謂讀書人者，其實都是沒用的份子，最沒用的就是他們的身體的孱弱不中用，因爲身體的孱弱不中用，則他們雖是「雄略蓋世」，也往往埋沒在書房裏，也往往中途坍下來了。有什麽用呢？請問一頭嬴弱削瘦的馬，它能「任重致遠」麽？</p>
<p>古來的讀書人到底是怎樣的孱弱法呢？出世就像千金的閨秀般的關在房裏，訓導着他埋頭伏案，再長大些，更　「勤學」爲美訓，呌他去學　螢讀書，呌他去鑽股發憤，生長在富有的家裏的，則每每以娶小媳婦爲督促兒子勤學，父親只希望兒子拚命地在書房裏下苦工，兒子也覺得只有這樣才是辦法，才是前途光明的燈塔。</p>
<p>殊不知事實竟大不然，結果十個讀書人有九個是殘廢人，近視眼啦，歪頭駝背啦，骨瘦如柴啦！癆瘵病啦，都是讀書人的代表像。這是社會逼成他們這樣的，那麽，社會對他們作怎樣的一種觀感？是曰··「千貴萬貴，白面書生！」面果然是雪白，祗有身體則太寃屈了。以此，一代一代的延續下來，結果便是一代不如一代。</p>
<p>現在有許多人嚷着，中國的民族太衰弱了，太頽唐了在這「比力」的世紀裏，譬碰臂，拳頭對拳頭，我們當然是站不到上峯，連平峯都談不上，只有屈服在下面。</p>
<p>時來臨了，我們應該有一番猛省！　　老前輩蔡孑民先生畢竟是「人老心不老」，曾經在一篇談現代學生的必具條件的大作裏，很誠摯的曉示我們，若想做一個現代有爲的學生，第一是必須</p>
<p>陽</p>
<p>具有　子一般强健的體魄，才能担當起時代的使命，西哲有言曰「美的精神寓於美的體魄」這誠然是金科玉律」，値得做我們一句痛快的口號，値得做我們的生命的座右銘。靑年朋友，學生朋友呀，我們生長在這艱險的時代裏，要想有事業的前途，我們就必要把握住這一着呀！否則，儘管你「面白」到如何程度，在今日也是不中用了。</p>
<p>那麽，我們要怎樣才能有强健的體魄呢？這就是需要來一個「健康運動」。積極的便是從適宜的運動做起，消極的便是從攝生，從衛生着力。各種的球類，在可能範圍以内，我們不妨去多玩玩，我們的生活要有規律，我們要隨時攝生。</p>
<p>社會，國家，有許多的事，正待我們將來去努力，我們也正是有事業慾望的人，此刻我們必要凖備，凖備我們的體魄。</p>

<p>「姐姐，今天住在這兒吧？」十歲的菊貞，望着她的姊姊這般說。姊姊好像不聽得菊貞的話似的只不做聲。</p>
<p>「媽，姐姐今天住在這兒嗎？」菊貞得不到她姊姊的回話，就轉身問她的媽媽了。</p>
<p>「我不知道，也許晚飯後她仍要轉去的。」她媽淡淡的這回答了一句。　　這時，天漸漸的夜了。淡藍的天穸，漸漸變成蔚藍，又漸漸暗下來，終於漆黑了。菊貞的家裏電燈亮了。一會兒晚飯開了。於是大家圍着桌子吃晚飯。　　在這吃晚飯的時候，姊姊吃得很快，好像吃罷了要趕緊回家的模樣。菊貞見了很不髙興。她想自從姊姊出嫁了後，很難得在家裏過一宵的，常常是性急得很吃了夜飯回家去。今天晚飯後，一定又是趕緊回家的了。</p>
<p>晚飯後，大家休息在房裏。姊姊和媽媽在說話。菊貞望着她們又不耐煩起來了。</p>
<p>「姊姊，住在這兒罷。」是菊貞的話。</p>
<p>「我要轉去的。」姊姊回答菊貞。菊貞很不快，只是說··「我早知道了。」　　「菊貞，姊姊是要回去的。改天沒事就可住在這兒了。」媽媽很溫柔的對菊貞說，好像在安慰她。</p>
<p>姊姊辭别了媽媽回去了。</p>
<p>菊貞沒精打踩的走到房裏，躺倒在自已的床上。一個問題在她小小掋腦海中盤旋··姊姊的心難道變了麽？她怎麽不愛我們的家了？</p>

<p>— 夢寒</p>
<p>沒有素酒，沒有鮮花，沒有薄奠，我祇有着一顆心，一掬淚，悽愴的酸楚的心和淚的共鳴！</p>
<p>妳，妳苦命者呀！妳的身世太可憐了，妳的運命太慘酷了，在生前，在病中，在死後，關於妳的一切··假使人類還有些微的同情和憐憫，那不論是誰，都不免爲妳一流傷心之淚的！</p>
<p>我和妳本不認識，更沒有如何深切的感情；祗因妳是來在這裏出賣汗的，我則地位較優於妳可比妳少出幾點汗血並且有權過問到妳們一些事體的。唉，我眞懺悔，我未能早一點知道妳的病情，直待妳已睡倒了七八天，妳的同居才來報告我，我才立刻給妳送醫院。誰料未隔兩日，妳遽賚恨長逝呢？</p>
<p>原知生與死是那樣的平凡，人與人也不過這樣的相關，病而死，旣非什麽悲壯的事蹟；死了的是妳│一個分文不値的勞働者│更非什麽了不得人物；有何不可一歎置之？但我三數日來，總覺有什麽刺傷了這顆幾經創痛的心窩似的。每聽到妳一些斷片的身世，和死後的種種慘景，更加緊了我心弦的顫動，終不禁涔涔淚下！</p>
<p>聽說··妳的家庭貧寒的，有着衰老的父母··爲了要生活，自幼就老遠的跑到上海來進工廠，而且現在都已靠着妳養活了。唉│妳想想你的父母，怎忍瞑目呢？</p>
<p>聽說··妳今年才是十八歲，假使妳生爲髙貴的小姐，正是黃金的靑春時代，未嘗不可睥睨而傲慢一切··但妳是要忍氣呑聲含辛茹苦埋頭在工廠中每日做十二小時的工作。老天無情，連這樣的悽慘生活，都不容妳多過，還有什麽可說呢！</p>
<p>聽說··妳在病中，獨個子睡倒，獨個子呻吟，直過了五六天，才有妳一個在滬的堂姊姊來看你。那時，妳的病勢，已是十分嚴重，而妳的這位姊妹，竟忍心地不顧而去。實際，她也有不得已的苦衷··她是和你一樣的將一天血汗換一天生活的，她旣無錢來爲妳延醫診治，她又無法維持數天的生活而放棄了工作專來看護妳，所以終不得不去。貧窮雖骨肉亦不能相顧，是多麽傷心酸鼻的事呀！</p>
<p>聽說··妳死後，什麽人都沒有到，什麽東西都沒有置辦，雖然給了信妳家裏，你的父母終不見來，許是連盤川都發生了問題吧？最後還是由廠方包辦了一切，費用亦僅數十元，棺木衣　的菲薄，概可想見。生前死後，如此如此，怎不令人慘然！</p>
<p>呵！世界是偏狹的呀！人間是冷酷的呀！妳，我，我們，一羣的同命鳥咧！都將爲世界所驅遂，都將爲人間所擯棄！死，只不過一切之終點而已！是苦痛？也許是幸福？</p>

<h3 id="e13">Opening of Through Traffic to Beiping-Shenyang; Passengers Passing Through Shanhaiguan Must Be Inspected by Customs Officers; Chief Commissioner of Tianjin Customs Visits Yin Tong Yesterday to Discuss Procedures for Customs Officer Inspection; Beiping-Liaoning Railway Bureau Fully Prepared for Everything <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Chief Commissioner of Tianjin Customs, Baus, visited Yin Tong at Ninyuan at 5:00 PM this afternoon to discuss the customs inspection procedures for passengers passing through Shanhaiguan on the Beiping-Shenyang through train. The discussion lasted for an hour. It is stipulated that the Beiping-Shenyang through train will stop for forty minutes at Shanhaiguan. All passengers on trains going to Shenyang or Beiping will be inspected by customs officers and their foreign passports will be checked. Those whose inspection is not completed will be inspected again by pseudo-customs officers when the eastbound train reaches Qiansuo, and the westbound train will be inspected again in Qinhuangdao. The Beiping-Liaoning Railway Bureau is fully prepared for all matters related to the opening of through traffic. Although a part of the news was announced by the Railway Bureau on the 28th, officials are still under orders not to disclose most of the important information. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The passenger ticket style used for the Beiping-Shenyang through train is different from the current train tickets. It is printed on soft paper with the words "Oriental Travel Agency" printed on it. It is eight centimeters high and twelve centimeters wide, and is made into three connected tickets, each four centimeters wide, with light red, yellow, and green to distinguish the class of travel. Passengers hold two tickets, the ticket office keeps one, and one ticket is torn off by the ticket checker when passing through Shanhaiguan. The remaining ticket is collected by the conductor before reaching the destination. The number of agencies selling through train tickets is five, designated by the Oriental Travel Agency: 1. International Tourist Bureau, 2. China Travel Service, 3. American Express, 4. Wagons-Lits, and 5. Thomas Cook. Ticket offices at major stations also sell tickets on behalf of these agencies using the same method. The Oriental Travel Agency purely imitates the Wagons-Lits model, renting railway cars and paying a certain rental fee each month. The Beiping-Liaoning and South Manchuria Railways have no right to interfere with the operation inside the cars. The capital is one million, which is divided between the China Travel Service and the International Tourist Bureau and deposited with the Beiping-Liaoning and South Manchuria Railway Bureau as a deposit. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yin Tong said that the news released in Beiping on the 28th was very simple. Regarding why the China Travel Service was ordered to handle the through traffic, it was because the company is a government-approved and registered organization. Since our side has a responsible organization, the Japanese side also found an equivalent organization, the International Tourist Bureau, to jointly handle and be responsible for the operation. He is unsure whether he will go to Beiping within a few days. He has been to Shenyang before, so there is no need to go again when the through traffic opens. Even the staff of this railway do not need to accompany him. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Regarding the public announcement of the through traffic news on the 28th, Nitta Ryo, the South Manchuria Railway representative in Tianjin, contacted Yin Tong by telephone this afternoon. The Beiping-Liaoning Railway Bureau will inform all employees of the process of handling the through traffic at 10:00 AM on the 28th. The content of the notice is roughly the same as what was publicly announced in Beiping, intending to let the Railway Bureau know the truth. The items to be announced by the Beiping-Liaoning Railway Bureau in Beiping on the 28th are the through train timetable, fares, and the operating agency, not involving the details of the Oriental Travel Agency organized by the International Tourist Bureau and the China Travel Service. The Railway Bureau will issue a separate notice, the original text of which is no more than seven or eight hundred words, briefly describing the process of handling the through traffic. The previous report that Yin Tong and the Beiping-Liaoning Railway Bureau were planning to issue a declaration on this day has now been clarified as inaccurate. The agencies selling through train tickets on behalf of the Oriental Travel Agency are designated as: 1. China Travel Service, 2. International Tourist Bureau, 3. British Thomas Cook, 4. American Express, and 5. French Wagons-Lits. The Beiping-Liaoning and South Manchuria Railway's major stations will also sell tickets on behalf of these five agencies on an agency basis. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Beiping-Shenyang through traffic will be implemented from July 1st. Yin Tong, Director of the Beiping-Liaoning Railway Bureau, has reported the general situation to the Ministry of Railways. In order to understand the detailed situation of the negotiations on the through traffic issue, the Ministry of Railways recently telegraphed Yin, urging him to send staff to Nanjing to report.

<p>(Nanjing) Shen Kefei, Director of Surgery at the Nanjing Central Hospital, was responsible for the deaths of An Qian, the seven-year-old son of An Shunxian, the Party Representative of the former 43rd Army, and Chen Yunzhi, the second daughter of Chen Zhezhen, during surgical operations in May of this year. The An and Chen families have separately filed lawsuits with the Nanjing Local Court. Recently, Control Yuan member Zhu Zongliang, believing that the hospital superintendent, Liu Ruiheng, rarely inquired about hospital affairs and was irresponsible, and that the vice-superintendent, Shen Kefei, was arrogant and treated the hospital like a government office, with negligent management, has filed an impeachment with the Control Yuan, requesting that they be transferred for disciplinary action separately. After investigation, the impeachment was established, and the Yuan has copied all the documents and prepared a document for transfer to the Central Public Officials Disciplinary Committee for investigation and handling. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Control Yuan has determined that the case of Control Yuan member Zhu Zongliang's impeachment of Liu Ruiheng, superintendent of the Beijing Central Hospital, and vice-superintendent Shen Kefei for dereliction of duty and disregard for human life should be transferred for disciplinary action, and the Control Yuan has reported the situation to the Central Disciplinary Committee for handling. (27th Central News Agency Telegram) (Nanjing) The Beijing Municipal Party Department, regarding the corrupt management of the Central Hospital, specially submitted a report to the Central Government on the 27th, requesting the removal of Superintendent Liu Ruiheng in order to emphasize medical administration and protect human life. The original report stated that Liu held several positions and could not concentrate on hospital affairs, resulting in repeated loss of life. Although the superintendent declared improvements, they have not been implemented, and the delay in the lives of the people continues. The Central Government is urgently requested to instruct the competent authorities to remove Liu from office and appoint someone else to take on the position full-time.

<h3 id="e18">Abolishing Excessive and Miscellaneous Taxes and the Economy of North China <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>— Respectfully</p>
<p>Although the order in North China today has a symbolic appearance of stability, the inherent crisis is lurking everywhere. The hardship of the people's livelihood, the reduction of local tax revenue, and the increasing pressure from Japan are all making the authorities struggling to cope. The fiscal problem is only one aspect of this. Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi's inspection of North China after the close of the National Financial Conference, at a time when local excessive and miscellaneous taxes are to be cut, is intended to seek the consolidation of North China's finances, and the intention is very good. However, future achievements cannot be predicted today.</p>
<p>The exhaustion of our national strength has been going on for a long time, and the reasons are not simple. Governance is difficult to establish immediately. For example, the prosperity of North China in the past was due to its role as the political center of the country, and it also relied on the prosperity of the Northeast and Mongolia. In recent years, the national capital has moved south, and the political center has moved with it. After the September 18th Incident, the commerce of the Northeast was entirely controlled by the Japanese, and the severance of relations with Outer Mongolia was not something that happened overnight. The scale of the Shanxi merchants in the past has gradually changed into a historical relic.</p>
<p>Today, medium-sized cities in North China, such as Zhangjiakou, Datong, Suiyuan, Taiyuan, and Baoding, are all declining day by day. Even the cultural undertaking of the old capital, Beiping, is only a nominal one. What else can be said? The port of Tianjin is the hub of the Jinpu and Beining Railways and the center of the Beiyang shipping industry. It should be able to stand alone in North China and prosper. However, the local area lacks a strong industrial economy as its foundation. It only ekes out a living through import and export trade, and will never be able to extricate itself from the quagmire of depression. The cities of North China are like this. As for the general rural areas, they still retain the simple and unadorned legacy of thousands of years. The farmers work hard all year round only to seek food and clothing. However, due to the stimulation of economic panic, a bankrupt state has been formed. Even if there is a bumper harvest, it is not enough to make up for the old debts. If they are unfortunately hit by natural disasters and man-made calamities, they will have no way to survive. More than a year after the signing of the Tanggu Agreement, the Japanese troops in the war zone are still looking for trouble everywhere, and local ruffians and thugs are taking advantage of the situation to act arbitrarily. As a result, the entire North China is in a precarious situation.</p>
<p>We deeply feel that in order to consolidate the finances of North China, we should first seek the stability of the political situation, and secondly, implement the abolition of excessive and miscellaneous taxes. The former is not what this article intends to discuss, that is, to speak of the latter, such as the expression by Song Zheyuan, Chairman of the Chahar Provincial Government, that the current deficit in the province's finances is actually more than 300,000 yuan per month. After the abolition of excessive and miscellaneous taxes, the province's revenue will be reduced by one-half, and it will not be able to support other North China provinces and regions. Although not as poor as Chahar Province, the general situation is quite similar. The local government relies on excessive and miscellaneous taxes to fund its troops. For more than ten years, they have been emulating each other, which has become a difficult problem to solve. The exhaustion of the people's strength in North China has long reached its limit, and the development of local areas is difficult to predict. If the local authorities still do not know how to empathize with the suffering of the people and continue to imitate the behavior of the warlords in the past and carry out the action of draining the pond to catch the fish, then the people will have no way to survive and the government will have no way to seek governance. It is hoped that Minister Kong and the military and political leaders of North China can consistently take into account the credibility of the central government and respect the decisions of the financial conference, and in any case, take the abolition of taxes and miscellaneous taxes as an obligation that can and should be fulfilled. It must be known that the excessive taxes come mostly from raising troops, and having too many troops not only cannot defend themselves, but is also enough to hasten their own destruction. If the finances are strained, the military needs will naturally be insufficient, and how can the half-starved troops compete with the elite troops of a powerful country? For the current plan, even if it is not possible to immediately reduce the troops, a major decision should be resolutely made that no new recruits will be recruited in the future, no vacancies will be filled, and the existing troops will be gradually reorganized and disbanded. If this is the case, the cost of raising troops will not be difficult to gradually reduce, and the so-called excessive and miscellaneous taxes can be abolished without being abolished.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Ministry of Finance Drafts Import Tariff <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Reducing Tax Rates on Daily Necessities</p>
<p>Submitted to the Central Government for Approval and Implementation</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The financial authorities stated regarding the revision of import regulations that this revision of the system will make appropriate increases and decreases to the old tax regulations formulated in the past, depending on the circumstances. This is a necessary measure in tariff administration. Since our country's tariff autonomy, except for a portion of the treaties that have not expired, which are inevitably slightly restricted, no other aspect may interfere. Moreover, the Sino-Japanese reciprocal tariff treaty expired last year, so Japan has no reason to object to this revision of tariff regulations in our country. Moreover, import tariffs and export tariffs are similar in nature. According to the current situation, the goods are classified clearly and the tax rates are increased and decreased, and not completely increased. It is said that most of the increased taxes belong to luxury goods, followed by canned goods and light bulbs. The current Legislative Yuan authorities attach great importance to this new tariff and are still carefully reviewing it. It is said that the Legislative Yuan may have points to discuss regarding the procedures. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The revision of the import tariff rate has been completed and the Ministry of Finance is preparing for the announcement procedures. It is planned to implement it on July 1. The Legislative Yuan is scheduled to submit a report at its routine meeting on the 29th. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The customs import tariff recently drafted by the financial authorities is based on the financial economy of our country and various international trade situations, and the import tariff rates will be reduced, exempted, or increased. Generally, the tax rates set for people's daily necessities and goods with relatively low domestic production have been reduced compared to the past, and there is also convenience for the circulation of international trade, so the tax rates have been reduced. Therefore, this revision of tax rates is very suitable for the domestic and foreign situations, and does not hinder the development of commerce in all parties. The import tariff drafted by the current Ministry of Finance has been submitted to the Central Government for approval and implementation. (27th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>(London) The Morning Post reports that the British Cabinet has now made a concrete decision on the policy of expanding armaments. An important statement on this matter will be issued soon. (National Telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(London) As hopes for the 1935 Naval Conference gradually diminish, the British Cabinet held a meeting this morning at 11:00 AM. It is reported that a major decision has been made to increase spending on the navy and air force. According to reliable sources, the Cabinet has also approved an increase in the army budget. Britain will implement a large-scale plan to expand its armaments in the middle of next week, as the government will then submit supplementary funding requests for the army, navy, and air force to Parliament. The preliminary naval talks recently held here have revealed a deep divergence of views among the United States, Britain, and Japan, making the success of next year's naval conference very doubtful. (National Telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(London) The Conservative Party's Morning Post reports that the British government has decided to adopt a policy of rearmament. This decision will be announced soon. It is said that the British government has decided to reorganize British defense in the short term. In addition to the existing plans to strengthen the air force, it also intends to strengthen the navy. The hope of reaching an agreement on the formation of navies among various countries is gradually fading, so the need for Britain to expand its navy is becoming increasingly urgent. The British government has decided to expand its navy, and the scope of expansion, which will be considered in the current talks between British and American representatives, will be above and beyond what is currently being considered, pending the failure of naval negotiations or the indefinite postponement of the naval conference. According to reports, the scope of the British navy's request for expansion includes four items: (1) Building a new battleship fleet; (2) Building 30 new cruisers, bringing the total to 70; (3) Building many destroyers; (4) Building many aircraft carriers. (Havas Telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Star newspaper here has learned from well-informed sources that if the next naval conference cannot achieve satisfactory results, the United States plans to start building a new battleship at the beginning of 1936 to replace old ships that have reached their age limit. The last battleship built by the United States was the "West Virginia," which was launched and commissioned in 1921. (Havas Telegram on the 26th)</p>

The reply will be delivered to US Secretary of State Hull by Ambassador Lindsay to the United States on Wednesday and will be released on Thursday. The wording is very mild, but it firmly opposes the US proposal to repay the debt with goods. It is heard that the British reply used conciliatory language because Britain wants to ease the current tense atmosphere between Britain and the United States caused by the naval preparatory conference.

<p>(London) Privy Councilor Baldwin said in the House of Commons today regarding the naval talks in progress that the location of the 1935 Naval Conference has not yet been decided. Japan has not yet made a demand for naval equality. As for the progress of the talks, matters are confidential and he cannot elaborate. (Reuters Telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(London) During the meeting of British and American naval experts on the 21st of this month, the British representatives submitted a list of the minimum warships and armaments required for British defense to the American representatives. The American representatives sent this document to Washington to await instructions before holding another meeting. It is now learned that the British and American representatives or experts are scheduled to reopen the meeting tomorrow. The demands made by Britain have been studied by the Washington Naval Department. It is heard that the department believes that Britain only knows how to make demands without considering whether the other party can agree, and has not considered the revision of the London Naval Treaty. Therefore, the US government has instructed the US representatives that if a compromise can be reached on the 1935 Naval Conference, the British government should explain its demands in detail and propose procedures for conducting the naval conference. As for the current negotiations, if they fail, Washington believes that there is no need to express an opinion on the demands made by Britain. It seems that the American representatives will still maintain a wait-and-see attitude, waiting for Britain to explain its views in detail, and will not make any suggestions, which can be inferred.

<p>(Tokyo) Observing the situation of the London disarmament preparatory consultation, Britain and the United States seem not yet to have decided on any specific matters regarding the disarmament conference. The real policy decision will be made around October. After yesterday's cabinet meeting, Foreign Minister Hirota and Navy Minister Osumi stayed behind to exchange information on individual talks and discuss the fundamental policy on disarmament. As a result, both sides agreed to reject all existing treaty-defined quantitative plans based on current strengths and unanimously advocated that Japan propose a concrete plan to the disarmament conference to reduce both quality and quantity at the same time. Not only should countries with high levels of armaments reduce their holdings, but countries with inferior armaments should also reduce their strengths, thereby contributing to the world's disarmament efforts. The outline of this counter-proposal can be drafted in October this year after Ambassador Saito to the United States and Ambassador Sato to France return home. Moreover, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that, given the current situation in Europe, even if France and Italy cannot participate, it is still highly desirable to achieve a disarmament agreement among Britain, the United States, and Japan (Dentsu Telegram on the 27th) (Tokyo) In view of the progress of the British-American naval preparatory negotiations, the Japanese Navy Ministry has decided to send another military officer who is well-versed in naval affairs to Britain to assist Ambassador Matsudaira.

<p>Rome: The "Fascist Lavoro" newspaper claims that the Soviet Union and Germany must be invited to participate in the 1935 Naval Conference, and especially insists on inviting the Soviet Union to be appropriate. The newspaper claims that "The Soviet Union is a power in the Pacific, Baltic, and Black Sea regions. The main defect of the Washington Treaty is that the Soviet Union did not join.

<p>(London) The Liberal Party's organ, the "Manchester Guardian," published an editorial this morning discussing the prospects for the 1935 Naval Conference and commenting on the current naval preparatory negotiations. It severely criticized the British government's policy, stating that when other countries demanded that our country limit large warships in the past, the government stated that the limit was 56 ships. When the issue of limiting naval armaments was raised for discussion, the general public then realized that the limit for large warships had to be increased from 56 to 70. It is generally believed that the naval construction program drafted by the British Admiralty contains a number of cruisers and destroyers that exceed the limits stipulated by the London Treaty, and the amount exceeded is very large. If the government's intention is indeed like this, then our country has failed to lead the way and is unwise. The main purpose of our country's naval policy should be to extend and strengthen the effectiveness of the Washington and London Naval Treaties. Although the Washington and London Naval Treaties are not perfect, the restrictions on the size and number of warships and the total tonnage of cruisers and destroyers are of great benefit. Therefore, this kind of step can prevent naval armaments competition. If the Washington and London Naval Treaties cannot be extended and remain effective, then armaments competition will inevitably restart. (Havas Telegram on the 27th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of the Army held a meeting yesterday afternoon at 2:00 regarding the budget compilation policy for the coming year. Chief officials such as Army Minister Hayashi and Vice-Minister Yanagawa attended. Although the aim is to reduce expenditures to the extent possible, in view of the international crisis, it was decided to propose various new budget plans, namely: 1) Expanding the Army Air Force. The reason is that the Japanese Air Force is inferior to those of other countries, especially because Russia is rapidly strengthening its air force, which makes Japan feel extremely uneasy. The expansion plan will continue for five years, with a budget of 150 million yuan for the coming year. 2) The Manchurian Incident expenses cannot be eliminated by the end of next year because Manchuria is still not stable; moreover, it may be necessary to increase troops again, so this budget must also be increased. 3) Expenditures for material preparation, reforming weapons, and adding new armaments are indispensable. This budget should also be increased. There are also other new plans, so the budget will be greatly increased. (United Press dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In view of the serious international situation, Army Minister Hayashi has decided to make national defense the center of national policy, regardless of the direction of the political situation, to cope with the crisis of 1935.

The Army plans to hold meetings with the General Staff at any time to discuss this issue for reference. According to Army Minister Hayashi's opinion, after the Army's policy is decided, it will only be reviewed with the Prime Minister or other relevant cabinet members, and the content will not be released to the outside.

<p>(London) The Daily Express reported that in Turkey's recent naval construction program, "some warships will be built by Japan. During the Japanese naval tour of the Bosphorus Strait in April this year, personnel were dispatched to Ankara to sign a contract stipulating this matter. (According to a dispatch from the Turkish capital on May 27 of this year, Turkey had ordered ten light cruisers from Japan, which has been denied by the Turkish authorities.) What the Turkish government has ordered from Japan are two 8,000-ton cruisers, two destroyers, and several auxiliary ships. After completion, they will be driven to the Black Sea by Japanese naval personnel and handed over to the Turkish government. In addition, it is heard that Japanese industrialists will establish steel mills on both sides of the Sea of Marmara for the Turkish government (Note: The Sea of Marmara is between the Bosphorus and Dardanelles Straits). The Daily Express commented that in the era of Imperial Russia, Turkey lost territory to Russia in the Caucasus, which has not been returned to Turkey after the Soviet revolution.

<p>(New York) The New York Evening Post published an article yesterday by reporter Steele, stating that the Hitler government's lifespan would end within half a month, and it would be succeeded by a military dictatorship government with von Papen and Colonel Oskar, the son of President Hindenburg, as the backbone. Today, Steele published a second article in the New York Evening Post, stating, "Since Hitler came to power 18 months ago, Hindenburg and von Papen have handed Hitler the rope and let him hang himself. Now Hitler has finally hanged himself." Steele also said that within the last three months, Hitler's stormtroopers have mutinied about 60 times. Once a revolt occurs, it is feared that more than two-thirds of the stormtroopers will betray Hitler. According to Steele's observations, the national defense forces originally opposed Hitler, and the disputes over religious issues have further strengthened the momentum of the national defense forces among factions dissatisfied with the current government. Hitler's use of terror is of no avail. As for the legal provisions regarding the Aryan race (excluding non-Aryan races), they have not yet been implemented within the national defense forces.

<p>The World News Agency reported that this year's insufficient rainfall and reduced harvests are a common global phenomenon. The United States and Canada anticipate a record-breaking reduction in wheat harvests due to the drought. Europe has also experienced reduced sugar harvests due to the drought. According to the results of research by Dr. Abbott of the Smithsonian Institution in the United States, the cause of this global phenomenon is that sunspots directly affect the Earth's atmosphere. Currently, sunspots are vast, ranging from 500 to 5,000 miles in diameter, and these sunspots are caused by a major storm condition that cannot be associated with the Earth's climate. Dr. Fujiwara, a technician at the Japan Central Meteorological Observatory, also made the following announcement regarding the current drought situation: "Looking at past statistics, the three years before and after the maximum and minimum periods of sunspots are always warning years for climate change. Last year was the minimum period of sunspots, so there is a common global phenomenon of insufficient rainfall, and temperatures are also higher than usual. This year is the year after the minimum period, so it is still within the warning period for changes."</p>

That afternoon, when the Hungarian Senate discussed the budget bill, Archduke Joseph of the Habsburg royal family, a right-wing member, strongly attacked Barthou's declaration mentioned in the Romanian newspaper, stating, "Outer Transylvania is Hungarian territory, and I have fought there for many years. Reading Barthou's declaration, I cannot help but feel like I am burning in a fire. It must be known that the Treaty of Trianon (the treaty of peace with Hungary) destroys Hungary's historical rights and is unprecedented in the world." This was the affair of the 20th and 21st of this month. Today, members of all parties in the House of Representatives protested against Barthou's declaration. Several places were originally Hungarian territory but were ceded to Romania by the Treaty of Trianon. The Hungarians have long thought of recovering them, and now they are furious upon hearing Barthou's statement opposing the revision of the treaty. There were not many members at today's meeting, but the gallery and press seats were packed. Amidst applause, Foreign Minister Kanya presented a declaration and read it aloud to the crowd. Its contents were what the Hungarian Telegraphic Agency had already announced. After the Foreign Minister finished reading, several people spoke in succession, all saying that Barthou's declaration had disappointed Hungarian public opinion. There are many people in Hungary who sympathize with France, but hearing Barthou's words, they were all disappointed. Farmer Party member Ekkhardt said that Barthou was the first person after the European War to attempt to restore the old military alliance policy. Count Esterházy of the Christian Party said that the Covenant of the League of Nations originally had the possibility of revising treaties, but now someone who asks for a peaceful revision of borders is regarded as a "state of war." Then what is the benefit of joining the League of Nations? Bijinger of the Social Democratic Party also expressed his protest, but believed that the government should not accept constraints from Berlin, Vienna, or Rome. Prime Minister Gömbös also made a declaration. After finishing his speech, Foreign Minister Kanya said that the government would fulfill its due responsibilities in this matter, and hoped that the members would trust the government.

<p>(Paris) It has been reported from Tirana that political circles have expressed extreme concern after the sudden appearance of 20 warships of the Italian Adriatic Fleet in the Albanian port of Durazzo. It is believed that this move by Italy is a demonstration against French Foreign Minister Barthou's visit to the capital of Yugoslavia, and that Italian opinion intends to revive its waning prestige in Eastern Europe, especially in Albania. Because Italy's influence in that area has been gradually diminishing since the recent treaty between Albania and Yugoslavia. Furthermore, a report from a Belgrade reporter carried in the Xinwen Bao here stated that the Yugoslav government was not very alarmed by the sudden arrival of Italian warships in Durazzo, and believed that unless Italy sent sailors ashore, the situation would not be very dangerous. The reporter also stated that the revolutionary movement in Albania has not yet been extinguished, and the possibility of a change of government still exists. Perhaps this change is also supported by several major powers. However, it seems that Italy's exertion of influence in Albania is not welcomed by Britain, because if Italy exerts influence in the Adriatic Sea, Britain's influence in the Mediterranean region will inevitably be affected.

<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt returned to the White House today after a three-day vacation at his Hyde Park home in New York. He is preparing to deliver a radio address to the nation on Thursday evening, which will be his last important speech before the President's tour of Honolulu. Therefore, the people of the nation are eager to hear the head of state describe his achievements over the past six months. The President may deliver speeches from time to time as he passes through several important cities on his tour back to Washington, but they will not be of major political significance. According to sources close to the White House, the President does not intend to participate in the election competition this November. The President believes that to gain the trust of the people of his party, it is best to consider the interests of the people, so there is no need to travel around. According to today's news, the President's trip to Honolulu will include brief stops in Haiti and Cartagena, Colombia. Therefore, the precedent that American presidents do not leave the country during their term will be broken for the second time after President Wilson's trip to Versailles to hold peace talks.

<h3 id="e73">Future of American Finance: Purchasing Silver Will Cause Currency Inflation <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau will begin a one-month vacation next week. During his vacation, Undersecretary Coolidge will act in his place. (National News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Washington) It is believed in political circles that the new silver purchase plan at the end of this year will cause currency inflation of at least 94,050,000 yuan, and prices will also increase accordingly. Representative Dies, a member of the House Currency Committee, stated today that the Treasury Department has already purchased approximately 70 million ounces of silver, but the exact number cannot be determined because the United States is purchasing silver in markets around the world, and the forms issued by the Treasury Department have not yet recorded the recent purchases. According to other sources, the price paid by the United States for silver was previously 44 cents per ounce. Dies also said that the printing bureau is unable to keep up with the printing of new silver certificates issued based on silver. It is estimated that the Treasury Department must purchase 125.4 million ounces to meet the needs of the new bill, that is, 25 percent of silver as currency reserve. Adding the above figure to what the government already has will give the United States a total of approximately 200 million ounces of silver. Treasury officials estimated that the cost of purchasing 125.4 million ounces at a price of 75 cents per ounce would be 94,050,000 yuan, and said that it would be fortunate if the United States could purchase about one-fifth of the world's silver at an average price not exceeding 75 cents. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. Treasury Department stated today that as of June 22, it had purchased 8,945,000 ounces of silver based on the Executive Order of December 21, 1933, including 380,532 ounces purchased in the week before June 22. The expenses for purchasing silver are currently paid from ordinary funds and have not used the Exchange Equalization Fund. The value of the silver ingots stored on June 22 was 45,826,000 yuan, which is 953,000 yuan more than on June 1. The U.S. authorities collected 28,119,000 yuan in gold coins and 60,453,000 yuan in gold certificates based on the anti-hoarding order. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>

<h3 id="e84">Record of Japanese Military Appointments (Part 1): Predictions of Future Leaders <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>This month, the Nagoya Shimbun in Japan published a lengthy article titled "The Next Minister of the Military." The article comprehensively examined important figures in the national army and navy, providing detailed evaluations. This is of considerable value as a reference for those in our country who are concerned about the Japanese military, and is specially translated below:</p>
<p>Although it is difficult to predict the lifespan of the Saito Cabinet, it has recently experienced subtle decline and is beset by crises. It is expected that changes will occur soon. The succeeding cabinet is likely to emerge from one of three possibilities: Saito's resurgence, Ugaki's formation, or Kiyoura's formation. As for a Suzuki or Hirata Cabinet, there is virtually no hope.</p>
<p>The so-called dangerous period of 1936 is imminent. Who will be the future army and navy ministers is a major question currently. If the mandate to form a cabinet descends upon Saito again, it is feared that all cabinet members will not change and the current military ministers will not need to be replaced. Otherwise, if Saito retires, a problem arises. We should first seek candidates from the generals, including: 1) Commander of the Kwantung Army, General Hishikari Takashi. However, due to his current position, Hishikari will definitely not transfer to become Army Minister. Moreover, in reality, he is not a military politician, but merely a military commander. 2) Military Councillor General Minami Jiro. General Minami served as Army Minister during the second Wakatsuki Cabinet. Internal criticism was not bad. However, due to his age and lack of decisiveness, he is unlikely to rise to power again. 3) Military Councillor General Watanabe Jotaro. He and Army Minister Hayashi are classmates. He is one of the leading war history researchers in the military and also a reader. Most of his salary is used at Maruzen Bookstore, which shows that he is a scholar. However, he has no experience in military administration, only serving as a troop commander and rich in war experience. 4) Director of Technical Affairs, Ogata Katsuichi. He has the golden kite medal for war merits, but he is only a technical officer and not suitable for the position of Army Minister. Besides the above, among the generals, there are also Honjo Shigeru. Honjo is currently the Chief Aide-de-Camp and not qualified to serve as Army Minister. In addition, the only other candidates for Army Minister are Masaki, Abe, Araki, Matsui, and Kawashima. When Araki became Army Minister, his reputation was very good, but during his two-year tenure, his status declined significantly. Because he is talkative, he is disliked by those who are intentional. He claimed to be sick for some reason, but he was not sick at all and left the post of Army Minister. It is feared that it will not be easy to sit in the chair of the Army Minister again. The most likely of the other four is Army Minister Masaki Jinzaburo of the Kiyoura Cabinet and Army Minister Abe Nobuyuki of the Ugaki Cabinet. Masaki Jinzaburo can match Araki in this extraordinary period. After being transferred from the 8th Division Commander to the 1st Division Commander, he was transferred to Taiwan during the Ugaki Army Minister's time as Commander. During the Manchurian Incident, Chief of Staff Prince Kan'in telegraphed and requested that he serve as Vice Minister. He then went to Beijing and was very compatible with Army Minister Araki. He was credited with guiding various operations in Manchuria and Shanghai for one and a half years and was promoted to General, serving as a Military Councillor. Then, Araki resigned, replaced Hayashi as Inspector General of Education. He is inclusive and has great ambitions and is known for speaking his mind in the parliament. Therefore, within his department, there are calls for him to become Army Minister. However, he can command the three armies but cannot be regarded as a military politician. As for Military Councillor Abe Nobuyuki, he is a giant star in the Ugaki line. During the Hamaguchi Cabinet, he served as Ugaki's Deputy Minister. In June of the fifth year of Showa, he made every effort to break the iron wall of the Minister of Military Affairs' exclusive appointment system and acted as Minister of the Army on behalf of Ugaki. Therefore, he definitely has the experience of being an Army Minister. In principle, he should have served as a minister before Araki. Unexpectedly, the internal situation was complicated. It happened to be the time of the Ugaki line handover and he was changed to the commander of the 4th Division and then the commander of the Taiwan Army. He was only promoted to General in June of last year. In August, according to the regular movement of the army, he was appointed as a military councillor. Although he does not have a golden kite medal, he can definitely be called the only general. However, in today's situation, he may not be in the forefront of becoming a true military politician. If Ugaki forms a cabinet, then he is naturally in his bag. Who is the leader of the next cabinet? According to the general trend, Hayashi Senjuro is still in his original position. According to the constitutional aspect, if the cabinet changes, the cabinet members will naturally resign. However, the precedent of retaining the military ministers, such as the Tanaka Cabinet established in April of the second year of Showa, has been broken. Moreover, according to the current situation, it is feared that Hayashi Senjuro will be difficult to remove from the military. He is rare in the military as a virtuous and respected figure who can maintain military control. There are very few talents who can compare with him. The fact that his brother, Shirakami's problem, caused his resignation to fail was not his true intention. He had to stay in office due to the coercion of the military. From this, it can be seen that the next Army Minister will still belong to Hayashi.</p>
<h3 id="e85">False Organization Increases Defense Spending by More Than 17 Million Yuan Compared to the Previous Year: The New Plan of the Japanese for Military Affairs in Manchukuo <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Changchun Communication: Japan, in the current extraordinary international situation, in order to maintain its exclusive control over the Far East and attempt to attack Soviet Russia in the future, is expanding its army, navy, and air force strength under the name of a false organization, and shirking its obligation to reduce military spending, which it should bear internationally. This can be seen from the new budget announced by the puppet recently. In the false budget, the defense expenditure is 64,729,115 yuan, an increase of 17,397,308 yuan compared with the previous year's 47,379,807 yuan. Japan's active expansion of its military power in the Northeast can be seen from this. In the future, the Japanese will make the following plans for military affairs in Manchukuo: 1) New plans to improve soldiers' treatment, replenish troops, and replenish the number of soldiers and equipment are extremely confidential. 2) Set up the Xing'an Military Academy to cultivate powerful Mongolian military officers. Select a suitable location in Xing'an Province to set up a military academy directly under the puppet military and political department. 3) Establish a Gendarmerie Training Institute to establish a gendarmerie system on the premise of maintaining puppet military records. A gendarmerie training institute will be established in Jilin, directly under the puppet military and political department. 4) Complete the facilities of clothing and garrison hospitals, so that the puppet army's hygiene and cold protection will reach a complete state. In addition, a puppet "General's Office" will be established as a consultation mechanism for the puppet Pu Yi, and it is expected to make a powerful expression. (Northeast News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e86">Hebei, Shandong, and Henan: Water Control Projects in Three Provinces Planned by the Yellow River Disaster and Yellow River Benefit Associations, All to Be Completed Before the Great Flood: Kong Xiangrong to Visit Chahar and Suiyuan <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Beiping Communication: The Yellow River dike project in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan is of great importance. Your reporter today (26th) ordered Kong Xiangrong, a member of the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee and director of the labor relief group, to talk about Minister Kong's (Xiangxi) visit to the north this time. Due to time constraints, he did not have time to visit Chahar and Suiyuan, so he specially sent me as a representative to go. I am scheduled to take the Pingbao train north at 4 pm today, first to Zhangjiakou, and then to Suiyuan. The work of blocking the mouth of the Yellow River can be divided into three provinces: Hebei, Henan, and Shandong. 1) Hebei Province: Entrusted by Chairman Yu (Xuezhong) of Hebei Province, from the breach in Shitouzhuang, Changyuan County to Dacheji, a total of more than 30 miles, the dikes are all raised and thickened, exceeding the flood level of the previous year by an average of more than two meters, and the dike is more than eight feet thick. Part of this expenditure is saved from the Yellow River blockage project, and another part is 700,000 yuan, which Hebei will raise in advance. The fundraising methods are: 1. The Hebei Provincial Government negotiated with Minister Kong and agreed to extend the additional donation of Changlu salt for two years through the resolution of the Central Executive Yuan, as a guarantee, and borrowed 500,000 yuan from the Central, China, Communications, and other five banks. 2. The Hebei Provincial Department of Finance raised 200,000 yuan from the Hebei Provincial Bank, which was allocated to the Hebei Yellow River dike raising and thickening expenditure. The Hebei Provincial Government appointed Provincial Committee Member Hu Yuanhui as the Director of the Hebei Yellow River Rehabilitation Project Office, and I was also appointed by the Yellow River Conservancy Commission as the Supervisory Commissioner of the province, and ordered me to send engineers to take turns to supervise, and all the north and south dikes of the Yellow River in Hebei Province will be raised and thickened, so that they will be completed before the great flood. 2) Henan Province: The Henan Yellow River Blockage Project Office was established in October last year. In mid-January this year, I was ordered to serve concurrently. As a result of efforts, the closure project was completed within a month. The Yellow River disaster expenditure in Henan Province was sponsored by Minister Kong, and the original salt tax surcharge guarantee in Henan Province was used to borrow 2 million yuan from the Central Bank. In the future, the project will be the responsibility of the Henan River Affairs Bureau, and members of the Yellow River Disaster and Yellow River Benefit committees will be sent to supervise. At present, all important projects have been started, and it is expected that all dangerous projects will be completed before the great flood. 3) Shandong Province: Agreement has been reached with Chairman Han to have Shandong Province handle all urgent rehabilitation matters on its own. The project plans are all guided by members of the Yellow River Disaster and Yellow River Benefit committees and handled by the Shandong River Affairs Bureau.</p>
<p>Regarding the emergency rehabilitation projects in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces, the Yellow River Benefit Committee had prepared an estimated plan, which was submitted to the Executive Yuan and sent to the Yellow River Disaster Committee for review and overall planning. The committee then sent the director of the engineering group, Kong Xiangrong, to the three provinces by telegram, and all of them have been included in this rehabilitation project. The Shandong River Affairs Bureau replied that in addition to the estimated dangerous projects, there are also many projects to prepare for water defense. In this way, the water control projects in the three provinces have all been settled. (26th)</p>

<p>— Geng Ya</p>
<p>Joyfully Looking at Helan Mountain from a Distance</p>
<p>On the 5th, it was raining and not sunny, so we stayed in the same place. All the fellow travelers sat in boredom all day long, with nothing to enjoy. Some told jokes, some drank alcohol and played drinking games, some mended clothes, the camel drivers sang tunes and combed their hair, or twisted the picked camel hair (the weather is getting warmer, the camel hair is gradually falling off, and when it is completely shed in the hot summer, it cannot be transported and must be released) into ropes, each according to his own preferences, in an endless variety. The reporter could not stand the smoke and noise, so he put on a hat and went out to collect wild onions for recreation. Two Mongolians with red tassels, neck hats, hoof sleeves, and long robes galloped from the southwest. They were expected to be officials of the Wangfu. They wanted to say hello to them on the road. They could speak Chinese and said, "They are the Si Ye of the Etok Banner Yamen. Knowing that I came from the southeast, they immediately dismounted and talked to me, and immediately said, "Five ethnic groups are united, we are all one family." Then they asked with great concern, "The three eastern provinces have been captured by the little Japanese. Can the central government get them back?" "Is the Feng Army still in Beijing?" "Are you (referring to the reporter) public lords getting along well?" "The Xuantong Emperor is the nephew of the Japanese. I heard that "he listens to his uncle and is marrying a Japanese woman." Is it true? After the reporter gave a brief answer, he briefly inquired about the Wangfu's management of the people. According to the talk, the prince is passed down from one generation to the next and has four "Jia Langs" (like county chiefs) under his jurisdiction. Each Jia Lang manages five or six "Su Mu Zhang Ges." Each Su Mu Zhang Ge manages a number of yurts and a number of people. The property (cattle and sheep) situation and where they live are all recorded in books for easy collection of food and grass. People who commit crimes are severely punished for theft. Stealing sheep is already a light corporal punishment. Stealing horses often leads to death due to severe punishment. Moreover, it is easy to find traces of livestock stolen in the sandy land, and lamas can also predict where the thieves have gone. It is extremely easy to solve the case, so no one dares to commit crimes. In addition, people mostly live a nomadic life and have little contact with each other, so disputes are reduced. The "every hundred catches two, every fifty catches one" reward sheep collected are based on the amount of property. The yurt money of two or three yuan is collected (the lonely, old, and poor are exempt. The Wangfu also finds ways to support the only son and daughter), which is within the power of the people and will not lead to arrears and punishment. Therefore, the yamen is almost empty and the officials are like eating white salaries. The Wangfu is the private residence of the old prince and the young prince. The yamen is the place for office work. Officials are set up to manage. All major and minor official matters must go through the yamen before being forwarded to the Wangfu. Officials and people who visit the prince, receive distinguished guests, and perform the ritual of kneeling and bowing are the same as in the Qing Dynasty. The doors, windows, courtyards, flower gardens, and screens of the Wangfu Yamen are all in the Chinese style, but the spring couplets posted on the doorposts are not in Chinese but in Mongolian. The young prince can already lead troops, and the old prince gradually does not ask about things and often goes to Xin Zhao to worship Buddha. Xin Zhao is the grand temple of Etok Banner. The halls and meditation rooms are all Chinese-style buildings and are magnificent. The main hall has three floors, with two bronze-clad gold Buddha statues in the middle, each about ten feet high. The Zhao has been built for hundreds of years. More than ten years ago, it was renovated once, costing more than 30,000 taels of silver. There are often hundreds of lamas chanting sutras.</p>
<p>After bidding farewell to the Mongolian officials, we walked along the stream. The clear grass on both sides was like a carpet, and there were countless small flowers, competing for beauty, but I didn't know their names. Suddenly, I saw twenty or thirty strange sheep, with yellow and red hair, long necks, and thin legs, slightly like deer. They were bowing their heads to eat grass. Hearing the sound of footsteps, they suddenly turned their heads to face us. Their horns were sharp and their eyes were bright, as if they were very fierce. I retreated a few steps, but they still raised their heads and did not move. I threw a stone at them, and they fled in a commotion, leaping like flying, reaching a distance of a mile in an instant, and then stood up in a group and looked up as before. I ran back to tell the camel driver. According to the talk, "This is called a yellow sheep, also known as a wild sheep. Since there are many, there must be young ones. Why don't you hunt them quickly?" So we took iron shovels and wooden tools and ran to the original place. The flock of sheep was no longer to be seen, but there were countless hoof prints, deeply embedded in the sand. The land in Inner Mongolia is vast and sparsely populated, with deep artemisia and abundant grass. Yellow sheep breed there, in groups of thousands, with agile spirits. What does a hunter admire? To live and thrive, it can be said that they are self-sufficient.</p>
<p>During this long march of more than ten days, I did not see a single tree. There are no grasslands or forests at all. I heard that near the Yellow River bank, there are abundant red willows, with thin branches growing in clusters, reaching a height of more than ten feet. All the lattice strips used for yurts, as well as the weaving of baskets and sheepfolds, are taken from the red willows. Unfortunately, I have not seen them. In addition, what often catches the eye in the mountains and fields are mostly: 1) Pheasant grass, growing in clusters, six or seven feet high, with tough stems that can be made into ropes. Many pheasants are produced in the grass, which may be the reason for its name. Livestock can eat it. 2) Sophora alopecuroides, the roots have a bitter taste and are a good medicine for throat diseases, that is, mountain soybean roots. The leaves are like sophora, so it is commonly known by that name. 3) Mountain artemisia, green in summer and autumn, yellow in winter and spring. Most of it is mountain artemisia, which camels like to eat. 4) Wolfberry, also a medicine, mostly growing in clusters, with branches three or four feet long. 5) Licorice, shaped like sophora alopecuroides, creeping all over the ground, which can be distinguished after careful observation. 6) Wild wheat, shaped like wheat, with thin leaves and small ears, is the best pasture grass. There is also the so-called "milk grass," which is extremely nutritious for livestock to eat. A Japanese doctor wanted to study this grass and made a trip to Mongolia. No one recognized it, so it was a pity that it could not be identified. 7) Bracteantha bracteata, also growing in clusters, less than a foot high, shaped like a puffball. 8) Cistanche deserticola, shaped like a fish, without branches or leaves showing on the outside, rising from loose soil, which can be dug out. 9) Cynomorium songaricum has a sweet taste and is shaped like a small red radish, used to strengthen yang, but the output is far less abundant than licorice and phellodendron. On the 6th, it was cloudy and not raining in the morning, with strong winds blowing, and the cold was pressing. The grassland was flat and wide, with nothing to block it. The wind came and went without obstruction, so it was more violent than in the inland. In the afternoon, the wind stopped and the clouds cleared. We packed our bags and set off. We first met three Mongolians, with red hats and yellow horses, galloping past quickly. The Baishui River, thirty miles away, was shallow and wide. We crossed the river slowly on the sandy beach, which was soft and undulating, like a spring cushion, which was very interesting. However, the camel's hooves sank deeply with a bang, and white pulp sprayed high, startling the riders and soiling their clothes. There were sand dunes nearby, and the wind blew the sand like a waterfall, which was very beautiful. We stayed overnight at "Ulan Shu," a total of seventy miles. There was a single tree, standing majestically on a high hill, like an umbrella, with broad needle leaves, which could not be seen from afar. The place was named after it. The well water was drinkable.</p>
<p>We set off in the afternoon of the 7th and passed "Ulan Tanzi." In that place, the artemisia grass was burned by fire, and the soil was thousands of acres, with no one asking for farming. Twenty miles away, there were two wells, six feet deep. From here, the Helan Mountains, 300 miles away, a line of blue, were vaguely visible. It is commonly said, "Seeing the mountain is like seeing Ningxia." We couldn't help but feel joyful. Forty-five miles away, we camped at "Kushui Jingzi." That day, we traveled a total of 65 miles. The well was deep and the water tasted bitter, but it was barely drinkable. On the way, there were also Moshui and Fan Shui. The water tasted astringent and bitter. If we had mistakenly stayed at those two stations, not only would it be difficult for people to drink, but even camels would not be able to drink. We had already passed them, which was very fortunate.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Guangdong Province Promotes the Unified Control Policy: The Government Will Manipulate the Economy and Finance: The Salt and Sugar Industries Will Be Monopoly by the Government <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Communication: The three-year governance plan advertised by Guangdong Province has a strict promotion of new unified control in its course, such as the economy, finance, agriculture, salt affairs, sugar industry, and industry, etc., which are implemented by the competent authorities and political research associations. For example, the Chaoshan sugar industry has established public warehouses for unified control and implemented government monopoly. Also, recently, various imported goods will be subject to additional taxes. The industrial unified control policy is as follows: 1) Establish an Industrial Improvement Committee to be responsible for handling the unified control affairs of the province. 2) The scope of unified control is limited to factories and industries, and household industries and handicrafts are not included in the unified control. 3) The first phase of the trial is limited to four types: matches, flashlights, rubber, and domestic kerosene. After success, the silk industry and other industries will be promoted. 4) After the implementation of unified control, on the one hand, the tax rate on imported goods will be increased, and the establishment of new factories will be restricted. 5) All factories under unified control, their production volume and output prices, are temporarily approved by the competent authorities, and cannot compete in production and sales. The management, manufacturing, product sales, and transportation of each factory are subject to the supervision and direction of the competent authorities. For example, the second trunk line of the East District Private Highway, Jiahui Road, has now been taken back by the government for traffic, and each section of the highway is supervised and directed by the Highway Bureau. For example, unified control of finance, the Department of Finance promulgated the Silver Market Trading Business Rules, and appointed supervisors to enter the market to supervise trading. It also promulgated the Measures for Silver Industry to Obtain Currency Certificates, Securities Trading, and Copper Yuan Price List to prevent merchants from manipulating finance. On the positive side, in order to reform the currency system, Guangzhou transactions are based on Hao Yang, but for purchasing goods and remittances to other ports, Da Yang must be used. In order to facilitate conversion, merchants often use the purchase and sale of Hong Kong paper as the standard for converting Da Yang. The financial hub of Guangzhou has been manipulated by Hong Kong dollars. The provincial government is now studying the method of changing to the Da Yang standard. Shantou has long used Da Yang as the standard. At the same time, it has adopted the virtual gold standard. Merchants can guarantee the use of a kind of banknote with real estate in the city, called guaranteed banknotes. This banknote has recently shaken its credit due to the decline in the price of guaranteed industries. The Department of Finance took the opportunity to implement a unified control policy and promulgated the Measures for the Issuance of Merchant Warehouse Certificates, allowing Shantou merchants to issue 10 million yuan to rescue finance. However, after the issuance, all the previously circulating guaranteed banknotes, white votes, auxiliary currency certificates, and circulation certificates, etc., must be recovered in stages. At present, the amount of merchant warehouse certificates registered and received in the city has reached 6 million yuan. If the existing guaranteed banknotes, etc., are to be recovered (about 4 million yuan), the actual revenue of the business field is very small. There is a great difference between merchant warehouse certificates and guaranteed banknotes: 1) They are government credit and belong to limited unified control. Each certificate has a face value of more than 100 yuan. Merchant transactions and trade are very convenient, but the market circulation is too large and not suitable for change. 1) They are private credit, and each certificate has a face value of 1 yuan, 5 yuan, 10 yuan, 25 yuan, and 50 yuan. The market treats them the same as cash. Shantou merchant warehouse certificates can be issued this month. Some people predict that these certificates cannot circulate in the same way as cash, and the future is not optimistic. However, after the government actively implements unified control, the provincial bank's banknotes will definitely guarantee the circulation of banknotes in the market and grasp the highest authority in the Chaoshan financial sector. The government's method of unified control of finance is progressing quite smoothly, such as Shantou's repeated prohibition of exporting foreign currency, and each person cannot exceed 20 yuan. In this way, the circulation of finance must be facilitated by remittance. It is heard that the government's strategy to stabilize exchange rates is to set up a remittance management office. All foreign currency (Da Yang) prohibited from export in this province, who need foreign currency or foreign exchange, should go to the office for exchange and issuance. At the same time, the circulation of foreign currency is prohibited in the province. If there are any concealments, they will be punished for disrupting financial crimes. If financial unified control can be successful, then economic unified control will be carried out, and the restriction of consumption in the province and the restriction of the import of foreign goods will be implemented. The restriction method is to increase a kind of protection additional tax and a special patent tax for foreign goods that are suspected of competing with local goods in this province. 1) Increase the additional tax on foreign goods, and the names of the goods have been announced, such as the collection of the Shimin soil additional tax. As for kerosene, paint, and foreign rice, special taxes have been held, and they have been implemented. It is heard that the match and paper cigarette special tax or special operation will follow. It is expected that after the implementation of the economic unified control policy, the financial aspects can increase a large amount of revenue, so it has been decided to start the economic unified control in the second half of the year. There are also agricultural unified control, such as the foreign rice tax that was opened last year, which is the precursor to agricultural unified control. Recently, the sugar industry is being unified, stipulating that the government makes sugar, farmers plant sugar cane, and merchants transport and sell it, almost completely imitating salt affairs. Ten major sugar merchants are selected in the province as operating merchants, and twelve major sugar markets are designated in the province. All sugar transportation should obtain a sugar transportation certificate, otherwise it will be regarded as private sugar. Shantou is one of the largest sugar markets and also a production area of local sugar. Fang Ruilin has been appointed as the director of the sugar warehouse, and many technicians have been sent to measure the establishment of a sugar factory in Jieyang. At present, Chaoshan merchants have stopped transporting sugar for import. Guangzhou is using ships to transport 2,000 packages to Shantou for the market. All those previously operated by merchants are sealed. After that, merchants are not allowed to sell sugar without a license. Even if the people have their sugar cane, they cannot privately own their sugar. (June 20th)</p>
<h3 id="e89">Bandit Gangs Retreat from Huichang; Bandits on the West Road Suddenly Become Rampant; Xiang Army Deploys Defenses in Zixing and Chenzhou <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Recently, the various armies suppressing the bandits in Jiangxi Province have been pressing closer to the bandit areas, launching a large-scale encirclement that is expected to be completed soon. Representatives from various armies are also gathering in Guangzhou to discuss the overall encirclement plan. As a result, the communist bandits in Jiangxi have also taken clandestine actions, planning to split into two routes to flee horizontally. Currently, a large force from Huichang has been secretly gathering in areas such as Changting and Shicheng. According to news from the front lines, Hu Yanguang, director of the refugee group under the Seventh Division of Huang Yanzhen stationed in Junmenling, reported that refugees fleeing from Mazhou stated: 1. There are no bandits within the city of Huichang. On the Dong side of the river, there are about 2,000 bandits from the pseudo-Newly Organized Third Army Corps and the Protection Section, with about 1,000 rifles. They lack bullets and place four water-cooled machine guns on the Dong River bridgehead every night to guard the city and prohibit people from passing through. 2. The pseudo-Guangdong-Jiangxi Provincial staff has moved to Shangbanling, ten miles east of the city, the Protection Section personnel have moved to Wazipai, twenty-five miles east of the city, and the pseudo-County Soviet has moved to Pengjingcheng, five miles east of the city, and Gaodi, twenty-one miles away. Tilong has four bandit forts and patrol posts. 3. There are only twenty to thirty pseudo-district Soviets in Macheng. 4. There are over three hundred armed bandits from the pseudo-Twenty-second Division in Zhantang, and over a hundred in Nankeng. 5. There are over a hundred bandits from the pseudo-Independent Battalion and the Supply Department in Shangbu and Youshui. 6. The bandits in Huichang are carrying out large-scale massacres, with as many as twenty to thirty people killed every day. It is investigated that the reason why the Huichang bandits retreated so quickly is that since Junmen was captured by the South Road Army, it has lost its stronghold, which it relied on as a barrier to Huichang. Repeated counterattacks only resulted in sacrifices. Since Junmen cannot be recaptured, Huichang can be taken at any time. Therefore, they carried out the deceptive plan of an empty city, first massacring the wealthy in Huichang, causing them to lose their courage and flee, and then forcing the able-bodied men to follow them, ensuring that the city was devoid of wealth and food to trap those who came later. Secondly, they gathered the remaining bandit soldiers from Huichang in one place to act at the right opportunity and preserve the strength of the bandit forces to embark on new routes. It is rumored that the destination of the bandits is western Jiangxi and eastern Hunan. Therefore, the bandits lying in ambush in western Jiangxi are becoming increasingly rampant. The gangs in Lianhua, Yongxin, Suichuan, and Ninggang are planning to unite with the remnants of Li Mingrui's forces in southeastern Hunan. He Jian, the commander-in-chief of the bandit suppression army on the west road, has transferred the two divisions of Liu Jianxu and Peng Weiren/Chen Guangzhong to Zixing and Chenzhou in southeastern Hunan to deploy defenses. At the same time, he has also requested Yu Hanmou, the commander of the First Column of the South Road Bandit Suppression Army, to send additional troops to prevent and block the bandits in western Jiangxi. Yu has recently ordered Kong Kequan's Tenth Regiment of the Fourth Division stationed in Shangyou and Chongyi to strictly block and suppress the bandits. He has also ordered the Independent Third Division to send teams to reinforce defense in Lechang and Renhua to strengthen the defense of northern Guangdong. The General Headquarters of the South Road Army also believes that the construction of a blockade line in the bandit areas between Hunan and Guangdong is urgent. Yesterday, it dispatched a delegation of staff members and technical experts led by Director Fan Zongchi to northern Guangdong, including Shaoguan, Nanxiong, Shixing, Lechang, and Pingshi, to inspect the completed fortresses and plan the defense works within the blockade line.

<h3 id="e91">Ministry of Communications Unifies Accounting Administration; Establishes Accounting Director's Office; Hires Experts for Public Audits; Formulates Telecommunications Accounting System; New System Implementation Shows Results <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Beijing News: Since taking office, Minister of Communications Zhu Jiahua, in order to realize independent accounting, first established the Accounting Director's Office of the Ministry, actively promoting accounting administration. In order to fully understand the current status of the Ministry's accounting administration and its effectiveness, the reporter specifically visited the responsible personnel of the Ministry of Communications yesterday, who gave the following statement: "The postal, telecommunications, and shipping industries under the jurisdiction of the Ministry are mostly public utilities. In recent years, due to national troubles and general economic decline, the transportation industry has been affected, resulting in its economic situation being extremely difficult. However, the imperfect accounting administration and system of the industry itself, the lack of strict auditing of budgets and final accounts, and the lax supervision of business revenues and expenditures are also important reasons. Therefore, after Minister Zhu took office, he first established the Accounting Director's Office of the Ministry to unify accounting administration and make it independent and in a transcendent position. He also hired accounting experts to study and plan with the responsible personnel of the Ministry and formulated a telecommunications accounting system for the subordinate telecommunications agencies to follow. The new accounting initiatives of the Ministry can be reported to you in the following three points: 1. Personnel Improvement: The Ministry, in view of the fact that accounting personnel in the past subordinate agencies have always advanced or retreated according to their superiors and lacked independence, therefore made accounting independent and raised the accounting authority. Special accounting directors, accountants, and cashiers are set up in the subordinate agencies according to the complexity of the affairs to organize offices. All accounting affairs of the agencies are handled by the accounting directors or accountants, and rules for accounting and cashier personnel are formulated for compliance. At the same time, the Ministry feels that there is a shortage of accounting talents and, in order to promote the examination system, in April of this year, it requested the Examination Yuan to hold a temporary examination for accounting</p>
<h2>Page 11</h2>
<p>personnel to select talents to take charge of sorting out accounting affairs. The successful candidates have now been assigned and employed. In addition, the Ministry feels that the accounting situation of the subordinate agencies has not been strictly audited in the past. Therefore, the Accounting Director's Office has been ordered to set up auditors to go to various places to audit accounts, and inspectors are sent to inspect at any time. On one hand, accountant Pan Xulun is commissioned to go to the subordinate agencies to audit accounts on a regular basis. In addition, accountant Ke Zuoshi is commissioned to send foreign accounting experts to be stationed in important agencies, such as the Postal Administration, the Savings and Remittances Administration, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the International Telecommunications Bureau, the China National Aviation Corporation, and the Eurasia Aviation Corporation, to audit everything in order to be strict and to use this as the basis for sorting out and finding ways to improve efficiency. Although this method is an innovation, it is to seek openness in everything, to show public trust, and to improve the accounting administration and popularize the accounting system. 2. System Innovation: The Ministry, in view of the complex telecommunications business, assets and liabilities, and business profits and losses, must have accurate statistics. Therefore, it convened personnel with accounting knowledge and experience to study and formulate the telecommunications accounting system, such as accounting subjects, accounting regulations, general accounting compilation methods, bookkeeping organization form formats, bookkeeping rules, allocation methods, and procedures for stipulating telecommunications budget, final account, revenue and expenditure, and audit standards. The new system has been ordered to be strictly followed by the subordinate telecommunications agencies and has formulated guidelines for implementing the new system for compliance. In addition, special registration examples are compiled for reference. In addition, in order to strictly control the budget of the subordinate agencies, the agencies are ordered to carefully compile the budget and strictly implement it, so that the budget is worthy of its name and saves public funds. 3.</p>
<p>Effectiveness of Implementation: The above-mentioned two points that have been implemented have been quite effective. For example, in the postal sector, the economy has been declining in recent years. Until the year before last, the loss was more than 10 million yuan. In the 22nd year, it is expected that revenue and expenditure will be offset, or even a surplus. After tightening, the Savings and Remittances Bureau has also become increasingly consolidated and has gained social credit. In more than a year, savings have increased by more than 50%. Now, due to the difficulty of investment, in order to ensure the interests and safety of depositors, many areas have stopped accepting deposits. In terms of civil aviation, the economic situation of China National Aviation Corporation and Eurasia Aviation Corporation was on the verge of bankruptcy the year before last. After the reorganization, China National Aviation Corporation has recently been able to be self-sufficient and has a surplus. Although the Shanghai-Xinjiang line has not been restored in Eurasia Aviation Corporation, internal affairs have also been improved. This phenomenon is creating a new record in the civil aviation industry. In general, the aviation industry in various countries relies on state subsidies to maintain, while China National Aviation Corporation is able to be independent and self-sufficient first. If the Shanghai-Xinjiang line of Eurasia Aviation Corporation can be restored, it is estimated that it can also have a surplus. In terms of navigation administration, after the registration office was abolished, expenses were greatly reduced. In the past, the various navigation bureaus and offices failed to follow the budget for expenditure, but after strict rectification, they are now fully following the budget, the accounts are clear, and the revenue and expenditure are verified. Although the old debts of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company have not been cleared immediately, internal affairs have been improved and the business has become more developed. The business revenue itself has increased by more than one million yuan compared to the past. Speaking only of the shipping industry, there is already a surplus. The Bureau has tightened its efforts and saved a lot of expenses. In terms of telecommunications, there has been obvious progress since the rectification, especially the development and expansion of international telecommunications business is gratifying. With the construction of wired electricity, there is no major expenditure on labor and materials due to the long-term lack of repair of various lines, and with the relationship between old debts and arrears, it can already have a surplus every year. Now, starting from the 23rd year, the new accounting system will be implemented, with the Savings and Remittances Administration as the agent treasury, unifying revenue and expenditure, stabilizing the lives of employees, and it is expected to have more satisfactory results. In order to implement a good accounting system, the Ministry will continue to study the improvement of the accounting administration of the subordinate agencies in the hope that the economy of the transportation industry will become increasingly safe and self-sufficient, and that large-scale construction can be planned and advanced."</p>
<h3 id="e92">Jiangxi Provincial Government Dredges Poyang Lake; Shallow Lakebed Often Causes Disasters; Dredging Will Also Benefit Navigation <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Raozhou Correspondence: Poyang Lake is close to the Yangtze River and is the general place where the rivers of Jiangxi Province converge. The lake area spans more than three hundred miles. The counties along the lake have fertile land and abundant products. The native products and merchandise of Fu, Xin, Rao, Yuan, and Rui Rivers enter and exit through this route, which is an important route in Jiangxi Province. Recently, due to lack of dredging for many years, the lakebed has been silted up, and the water storage capacity has been decreasing day by day. Whenever mountain floods break out in spring and summer, the upstream rivers pour down, and the river water flows back into the lake, causing widespread flooding and often causing disasters. Although levees have been built along the lake, they are difficult to maintain due to the violent water势, and the farmland along the lake is often flooded. In winter, the lake dries up and navigation becomes difficult. Now, in order to fundamentally prevent floods and facilitate transportation, the Provincial Government has ordered the Water Conservancy Bureau to implement dredging as soon as possible to fully accommodate the amount of water flowing in and avoid flooding. The Bureau Director Yan Tian has gone to various places along the lake to inspect in detail and will immediately start dredging. (June 21)</p>

<h3 id="e95">The Second Day of the Agricultural Warehouse Meeting in Various Counties; It Was Resolved That the Warehouse Location and the Agent Organization Be Merged; Storage, Mortgage, Transportation, and Sales Shall Be Handled by the County Warehouse Committee <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: The details of the first day of the agricultural warehouse meeting of 29 counties convened by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance have been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday (26th), the group discussions were held, with each three counties as a group, and each group discussed for 30 to 50 minutes. The discussion started at 8 am and ended at 6 pm. Due to the different environments of each county, the resolutions were very complicated. To summarize the main points, they are roughly as follows: 1. Determine the location of the warehouses in each county, and the original agent organizations shall be merged and handled uniformly. 2. Decide on the methods of purchase, storage, and mortgage, with storage and mortgage as the main focus, and transportation and sales shall be handled by the County Agricultural Warehouse Committee, and loans shall be made by the bank. 3. Processing equipment shall be determined specifically according to the situation of each county. 4. Regarding transportation and sales, the Agricultural Warehouse Management Committee shall contact the Shanghai Agricultural Products Transportation and Sales Office separately. Also, it is reported that the Department of Finance believes that the gradual promotion of agricultural warehouses in various counties involves a lot of affairs. If there is no special management organization, it is very inconvenient for the progress of the business. Therefore, it is necessary to actively organize the Provincial Agricultural Warehouse Management Committee. It is heard that the planning has started and will be realized soon. (27th)</p>
<h3 id="e96">Songjiang; Public Security Bureau Merges Sub-Stations <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The County Public Security Bureau previously received an order from the Provincial Government, roughly to the effect that it should reorganize the establishment to save police expenses and focus on police capacity to increase efficiency, and should report the plan for implementation in July. The autonomous region of this county has now been merged into eight districts, and the police districts should be re-determined. A police affairs meeting was convened on the 27th, presided over by Director Zhou Ding, and all the heads of the sub-bureaus and all the inspectors attended. Many case precedents were discussed. Regarding the issue of merging sub-stations, in accordance with the methods promulgated by the province, it was decided that the four sub-stations in the urban and suburban areas should be preserved, and the six sub-stations in Wu Ku, Xiao Kun, Qi Bao, Zhang Ze, Chen Jiahang, and Xinqiao should be abolished. The remaining police were incorporated into nearby bureaus. After the resolution was made, it was submitted in writing.</p>

<p>Gambling is rampant in this county. Although the public security organs have repeatedly investigated and detained those who violate the law, there are still those who dare to violate the prohibition to collect head taxes and gather for gambling. Today (27th) afternoon, the Public Security Bureau received a report that a certain Zhang had opened a stall on the north side of Baojia Bridge outside the west gate, where the wins and losses were very large every day, and there was public no fear. The inspector Zhu was dispatched to lead the special team to ambush and arrest them. However, the gambling house had a lookout. Seeing that the police were approaching, they had packed up and cleaned up, and the gamblers were all slipped away. Such meticulousness shows the scale of the operation.</p>

<p>The former Wu County Public Security Bureau Chief Shen Gao Chen was ordered to be transferred to Changshu County Public Security Bureau Chief. After Shen handed over the tasks of Wu County, he originally intended to go to Changshu to take over the job. Now, due to the adverse environment, someone has accused him in the province, and the locals in Changshu have not expressed welcome, so he has a negative attitude and said that he will not take the job. He has already submitted his resignation to the Department of Civil Affairs.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Wuxi: Bizarre Bloodshed at the Defense Corps <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>In the Second Squad, Second Platoon of the Defense Corps of Shangshan Township, Huaixia City, Eighth District, a bizarre murder occurred on the morning of the 26th. A cook and a soldier of the corps were killed and wounded. The deceased was named Han Zike, a native of Shouxian County, Anhui Province, 30 years old, who had enlisted for three or four years. The injured was named Han Weibiao, 40 years old, a native of Siyang, who worked as a cook in the squad. Usually, the two slept in the same room. Zike had an affair with Yue, the wife of Zhu Genbao of nearby Ni'jia Lane. Recently, their relationship soured. On the afternoon of the 25th, Zhu Yue argued with Zike at the squad headquarters and took away his watch and undershirt. This was learned by squad leader Zhu Meiji, who dismissed Han Zike for his misconduct. Zhu Yue was also scolded by her husband and attempted suicide but was rescued. At 10:30 a.m. on the 26th, a gunshot was suddenly heard in Han's room. Nearby residents went to investigate and found Han Zike dead, lying supine on the bed, a Mauser pistol beside his right hand, a spent cartridge under his crotch, a complete bullet next to his right shoulder, and two gunshot wounds on his chest and below his left breast. Han Weibiao was shot once in the abdomen, pressing his hand to his stomach, and squatting on the ground. Villagers reported to the squad detective Zhu Meiji, who ordered the injured man to be sent to the city and reported the situation to the company commander Gu Weijun, saying that Han Zike had shot and wounded Han Weibiao and then committed suicide. Afterwards, Tan Weinan, the director of the 16th Public Security Bureau in charge, also rushed to the mountain to investigate. They found Zhu Yue locked in the squad headquarters with iron chains. According to Zhu Xiangping, the deputy squad leader, the case was caused by jealousy between Zike and Weibiao. However, another version is that Zike resented Weibiao after being dismissed, so he shot and wounded him before committing suicide. In short, the case is extremely bizarre and complicated, and the content may be more than this simple. The township chief Qin Fengming has reported to the local branch court, requesting an autopsy. The acting prosecutor led officials to the village to conduct the autopsy on the morning of the 27th and confirmed that Han Zike had shot and killed himself. After the autopsy, they returned to the court to await investigation and handling.</p>

<p>The eighteen silk factories, including Xinyi, in this county, considered the improvement fee levied for the construction of the hall unaffordable. They repeatedly petitioned the model district of this county, requesting the revocation of the order, but were not approved. The manufacturers also sent a letter to the county chamber of commerce, asking the county to consider the plight of the silk merchants and exempt them from payment, but so far there has been no solution. The factories had no choice but to file an administrative appeal with the Executive Yuan yesterday. At the same time, they sent another letter to the county chamber of commerce, requesting it to forward the letter to the model district to retain the funds already collected. If the appeal fails, they are willing to pay, otherwise, they must be returned in full, and no deliberate difficulties should be created at that time. After receiving the letter, the county chamber of commerce has forwarded the letter to the model district for verification.</p>

<p>The anti-smoking committee members Qian Sunqing, Cheng Jingang, and Li Tiping, in view of the county public security bureau's recent searches for opium and red pills in stores and residences, which have caused great disturbance, sent a letter to the county government to express their views.

<p>The weather here suddenly became strangely hot starting from the 25th. In addition, since the beginning of summer, there has been no rain, and the fields in various townships have cracked, creating a drought. The villagers are all worried. At 8 p.m. on the 25th, four farmers from the eastern township secretly went up Mount Yu with axes and ropes, and suddenly chopped off the corners of Xin Feng Pavilion. When it collapsed, there was a loud noise. This was heard by the staff of the meteorological station on the mountain, who went out to check and saw the villagers had gone down the mountain and fled. It is said that the severe drought is because there is a lurking dragon under Xin Feng Pavilion, which can be activated to bring rain by chopping it down. Although this is superstitious, the farmers' eagerness for rain is evident here.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Jiangyin: Water Police Seize Illegally Held Military Weapons <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Xu Shaoqiao, the former captain of the water police, lived in Liuyigang, Jingjiang. After leaving office, he ran a local business and had considerable wealth. He is now the head of the Seventh District Defense Corps in the county. The other day, Jiang Fubao, on patrol boat No. 2 of the Third Squad of the Liuyigang water police, went to Xu Shaoqiao's house and seized more than 400 rounds of quick-firing rifle bullets and 160 Mauser pistol rounds. He immediately reported to He Zhiping, the captain of the Third Squad. Because He was a sworn brother of Xu, he delayed reporting it. On the 24th, Jiang Fubao believed that Xu's illegal possession of military weapons was a major case, so he crossed the river to Yin and reported to Captain Huang. Captain Huang dispatched patrol officer Jin Jishan and others to Liuyigang to seize the guns and bullets and take them back to the squad headquarters, pending investigation and reporting to the district headquarters for verification and handling.</p>

<p>The Jiangyin County Government, in handling the land dispute case of Yu Chunfa, discovered that Chen Shouting, a dismissed clerk of the county government, was falsely using the name of the county government to survey land in the countryside, secretly helping Huang Quanfu, Sun Linsheng, and others to destroy boundary markers and establish new boundaries, committing the crimes of swindling and deceiving. In addition, regarding the Yu clan's property case, Chen Shouting also sheltered Yu Defa's encroachment. On the 20th court date, Yu Defa was ordered to hand over all accounts within ten days, obtain guarantees from two stores, and Chen Shouting was detained for questioning and verification.</p>

<p>Since the collapse of the Decang Money Exchange in Haimen County in 1931, the manager Yan Zhenji has not publicly cleared the accounts. He was sued by shareholder Jiang Wang to the county government. He was summoned repeatedly, but Yan failed to appear. The other day, the county chamber of commerce convened all interested parties to attempt a reconciliation, but Yan was vague and insincere, resulting in no outcome. Yesterday (the 25th), creditors Jinlingchun and others, believing that the delay was hopeless, took Yan to the county public security bureau for transfer to the county government. At the same time, Jiang Wang also petitioned the county government to detain Yan and investigate him according to the law. The situation is extremely tense. The county government is scheduled to open a court hearing this morning (the 26th).</p>

<p>Since the beginning of summer in Wuyi County, the weather has been severely dry with no rain. The farmland everywhere is parched, the ponds are dry, and the rice seedlings are withering. The farmers are all frowning and worried, longing for rain. However, the heavens refuse to cooperate. During this plum rain season, not only is there no rain, but the scorching sun is raging, and it is extremely hot. On the 25th, the weather in this county was generally 101 degrees Fahrenheit, and up to 106 degrees in factories. On the 26th, it was generally 100 degrees, and around 100 degrees in factories. Today (the 27th), it has reached over 97 degrees by noon, and it may be even hotter in the afternoon. According to old farmers, the year 1856 was the Year of Jiaxu, with double plum rains and a severe drought. This year is also the Year of Jiaxu, with double plum rains. If it does not rain again, a drought and famine will be inevitable, so the prices of wheat, soybeans, and rice have all increased in recent days.</p>

It is now heard that Director Miao has submitted a proposal to the authorities to draw lots to buy all the salt transport sailing ships in order to gradually eliminate them. The workers were panicked again and sent representatives Tang Yuefeng and more than ten others to Yangzhou the other day to petition Jin Xin, the manager of the Yangzhou Audit Branch, and to visit Central Committee Member Wang, asking for ways to help.</p>

The bandits came to demonstrate and urge the redemption yesterday, and set fire to two haystacks before leaving, saying that if they did not redeem them again, they would tear up the tickets and set fire to the village and kill everyone.</p>

<p>The Yuxixian section of the Hangzhou-Huizhou Highway (Yulingguan to Shexian, the border between Zhejiang and Anhui) is 61 kilometers long. Chairman Jiang previously ordered the construction departments of Zhejiang and Anhui provinces to rush the construction of each section because the road is related to the transportation between the two provinces. Zhejiang Province built the 31-kilometer section from Yulingguan to Xiakeng on behalf of Anhui. Anhui Province built the 30-kilometer section from Xiakeng to Shexian. The entire project was completed and opened to traffic in November of last year, and the business was operated by Zhejiang Province. Recently, the Anhui Construction Department has mortgaged the Anhui section to the Hangzhou-Huizhou Road Business for the Changtu Automobile Company of She Yu to operate. Ye Zongqi, the inspector and director of the road administration section of the department, was specially sent to Hangzhou to consult with Zhejiang on the recovery of the road and returned the advances in full. It has been officially handed over to the business for operation. The Zhejiang Highway Bureau has also negotiated a joint transport contract with the company. It will only take six hours to reach Tunxi from Hangzhou in the future, which will be especially convenient for passengers.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Presents to the Ministry of Finance Requesting Chinese Language in Customs <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Customs Should Use Chinese Language Tax Forms Should Be Primarily in Chinese</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce presented to the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating that the Chamber presented a request, and that at the 5th General Meeting of Members on June 17, the Pen and Ink Trade Association proposed petitioning the government to order all customs offices in the country to implement the use of Chinese and abolish the English language as the primary language. The proposal stated that the government had previously proposed that all customs offices uniformly switch to using Chinese and abolish the English language as the primary language. Chinese characters are the primary language used by the general business community in our country, and only a small number also use Western languages. Moreover, customs has a close relationship with merchants, and it is inappropriate to create barriers due to language. As they are both Chinese institutions, they should switch to using Chinese characters to maintain national dignity. The proposal requested to be submitted to the general meeting for discussion and implementation. It was discussed at the general meeting and deemed that although customs offices have used more Chinese for letters and announcements in recent years, or have printed both Chinese and Western languages on the same sheet, tax forms and declarations, which are most relevant to taxation, still mostly use Western languages. This is one of the most difficult points for merchants. It was resolved to petition the Ministry of Finance to instruct all customs offices to use Chinese as the primary language in all documents.

<h3 id="e122">Letter Requesting the Shanghai Municipal Council to Order All Police Stations to Abolish All Harsh Punishments <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Chen Binghui and Others of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions Yesterday Sent Letters to Various Organizations</p>
<p>Xinxin News Agency reports that Chen Binghui, Zhou Fuzhang, Chen Jiufeng, and others of the Executive Committee of the First Special District Citizens' Federation of this city sent letters to various organizations yesterday, stating, "Dear Sirs, since our country's reform, we have governed the country by law, and all old non-judicial punishments have been abolished. Private torture is strictly prohibited by law. However, the police stations in the Public Concession have secretly set up electric torture, falsely accusing good people of being thieves. Once someone is electrocuted, they confess everything. If they die from electrocution, it is better to confess falsely to avoid death. Therefore, unless electric torture is abolished, the unjustly accused will never be able to clear their names. Previously, patriots Luo Sizhang and Lu Yong personally experienced electric torture and were sentenced for three months. After being released from prison, they appealed to various organizations, but their voices were weak and ineffective. Recently, Cai Yang was falsely accused of theft and repeatedly subjected to electric torture, resulting in serious injuries. Although the court has accepted the investigation, the police station has turned a deaf ear. There are countless others who are afraid to report it. In today's world, civilization is so advanced, how can such brutal punishments still exist? Now, when the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District District Court tried the patriotic martyrs Cao Songshou, Pan Hongsheng, and Tian Shuiyang, the three patriotic martyrs all said that they had suffered severe torture in the police station and could not bear the pain, so they had to obey the police station's instructions. Right and wrong were not determined by their own will. Hearing their words and considering the past facts, there must be countless people who have been unjustly accused under electric torture in the police station. Such inhumane and illegal actions are extremely hateful. Therefore, we propose that your association send a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council as soon as possible to order all police stations to abolish electric torture and other private punishments in order to respect human rights. This would be a great deed."</p>

<h3 id="e125">Fourth Marine Personnel Examination Held in Wusong Yesterday <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Ministry of Transportation Dispatches Gao Tingzi to Shanghai to Supervise Examination The Three-Day Examination Began Yesterday with 140 Candidates</p>
<p>The fourth marine personnel examination of the Ministry of Communications began yesterday at Wusong Merchant Marine School. The examination period is three days, divided into marine engineering and navigation. For the sake of caution, the Ministry of Communications specially dispatched Gao Tingzi, director of the Maritime Administration Department, Chen Shaoji, chief of the Maritime Administration Section, Wu Yinghui, naval staff member Liao Jingfang, and Xu Zufan, president of the Merchant Marine School, to form an examination committee, and Gao Tingzi was appointed as the chief examiner. All officials arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and went to the school to preside over the examination. It is estimated that more than 300 Chinese and foreign marine personnel registered for the examination, which is more enthusiastic than in previous sessions. Among them, some could not be present due to job commitments, so only 143 people participated in the examination. Among them, there were two German marine personnel, seven Japanese, two Norwegians, and two Portuguese. The rest were Chinese. Seventy-one took the marine engineering examination, and seventy-two took the navigation examination. It was rumored yesterday that the Japanese consulate requested a change in the examination system. A Guowen reporter specifically asked Director Gao about the truth of the matter. According to him, the Japanese marine personnel could not understand Chinese or English and were afraid that it would be difficult to take the examination, so they temporarily asked someone to translate. There were no problems, and the Japanese marine personnel took the examination as usual. As for changing the examination system, he had not heard of it beforehand and had not received any orders from the Ministry of Communications. The purpose of the examination is to ensure maritime safety and to protect the lives of marine personnel. It does not disregard their skills because they are not educated. This has been implemented in European and Western countries for a long time. There are many benefits and no disadvantages for the marine personnel taking the examination, so participation is voluntary. After a ship is set off, the lives and property of the entire ship are entirely in the hands of the three or five marine personnel. After the examination, not only is the shipping company relieved, but the marine personnel themselves have more protection in their services. More than 150 people who registered but did not take the examination will be given another opportunity to take a supplementary examination. As for the fifth examination, it has not yet been scheduled. The examination schedule and subjects are as follows: Day 1: Chinese, foreign language, cargo handling, ship management, marine personnel duties. Day 2: Navigation, marine engineering, shipbuilding, marine engineering knowledge, piloting, compass science, meteorology. Day 3: Scientific management, chart application, navigation instruments, seamanship, maritime laws and regulations, collision avoidance regulations, signals, swimming, etc.</p>

<p>The Chaozhou Guild, upon receiving news that the Ministry of Finance planned to announce new import tariff regulations with a reduction in the tax rate on foreign sugar, immediately sent a telegram on behalf of the sugar industry to the Nanjing National Government's Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Industry, stating: "To the esteemed Ministries of Finance and Industry of the Nanjing National Government: We have received a telegram from the Shantou Local Sugar Industry Association, stating that the Ministry of Finance is scheduled to announce new import tariff regulations on July 1st, which include a reduction in the tax rate on foreign sugar. Merchants have been deeply alarmed by this news, and the local sugar industry will be greatly affected. It is our understanding that the rural areas of Chaozhou and Meizhou rely on local sugar production to sustain their economy. Since the dumping of imported foreign sugar, the local sugar industry has suffered a blow and has been in decline, leading to the collapse of rural areas. Fortunately, our Ministry of Finance increased the import tax rate on foreign sugar the year before last, giving the local sugar industry a chance to gradually recover. If the tax rate on foreign sugar is lowered again, providing another opportunity for imported dumping and furthering their conspiracy of aggression, the national product source will be deprived, and the people's livelihood and economy will suffer even more. The esteemed guild shares a common origin and fate, and we request that you quickly telegraph the government to ensure that the original tax rate for imported foreign sugar is maintained when revising the new import tariff regulations, and that it not be reduced again, in order to protect domestic products and benefit the people's livelihood, etc.' Upon receiving this, we believe that lowering the import tax rate on foreign sugar would open the door for foreign sugar to dump its products. Although this is currently based on rumors and has not been confirmed, we cannot remain silent about what we perceive as a danger. We hereby telegraph this to your ministries for verification and request that you approve the collection of import tax on foreign sugar according to the original plan, in order to align with the commercial situation. We would be grateful for your convenience. Shanghai Chaozhou Guild, respectfully."</p>

<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, due to the unbuilt section between Zhakou and Cao'e River, has been unable to connect the entire line. Repeated plans have been suspended due to the funding issues of the Qiantang River Railway Bridge. The Zhejiang Provincial Government is now borrowing funds from six banks, including Zhejiang Xingye and Zhejiang Shiye, as well as the National Economic Council and the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund Administration Committee, to carry out the construction. Both railway bureaus are also planning to build the railway from Zhakou to Cao'e River, totaling approximately 80 kilometers, with an estimated cost of over 5.6 million yuan.

<p>The Sino-British Bank, regarding the funds allocated to the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways for debt repayment, has been able to pay them on time each month, business has developed, income has increased, and finances have become more stable. With the completion of the Capital Ferry and the upcoming construction of the Qiantang River Railway Bridge, both railway bonds have risen sharply on the London market. Now, in order to build the railway between Zhakou and Cao'e River, they are willing to continue lending funds to both railways at a very low interest rate. Previous loans were at 6% or 7%, but this time they are willing to reduce it to 4% or 5%. The Ministry of Railways has been conducting negotiations with both railway bureaus. The total amount is rumored to be approximately 5 million yuan, but the details have not yet been finalized.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Number of Silk Factories in This City Increasing Daily; Overseas Silk Sales Still Sluggish; Prices Remain Unchanged; Future Still Difficult to Be Optimistic <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Due to the impact of Japanese silk dumping in Europe and America last year, the silk factories in this city suffered a sharp drop in prices and were unable to maintain operations, leading to successive closures. After the spring cocoons came on the market this year, the factories have gradually resumed operations, reaching over 30 factories. However, silk prices remain unchanged, and the future is still difficult to be optimistic about. The following is a report by a Dagongbao reporter on the situation:</p>
<p>After the spring cocoons came on the market this year, the cocoon quality was excellent, better than in previous years. Therefore, silk merchants are actively trying to reopen factories. In this city, there are a total of 113 single and double empty silk factories. Those that have reluctantly reopened in mid-March and April include: Hengcang in Miaotou, Zhabei District; Yingfeng in Tanjiaqiao; Fengtai in Dayangqiao; Gongda and Huasheng on Zhongxing Road; Fuchang in Pengpuqiao; Xinglun and Yufeng in Gujiawan; Jiyu and Meifeng on Gonghe Road; Yutai in Tanziwan; Desheng on Liuying Road; Yongting in Yanjia Ge; Yuanxing and Yuanji on Yutong Road; Yutong and Yifeng on Meiyuan Road; Xiangmao on Tiantong Road; and Baotai Factory No. 1 in Dapuqiao, Nanshi District; Yuanyou on Alabaster Road in the Concession, etc., totaling 215 factories. Recently, five more factories have announced their reopening starting today: Jingwei in the Concession; Qianyuan on Changan Road, Zhabei District; Fusheng in Gujiawan; and Maofeng and Tongchang on Yutong Road. In total, 30 factories in the city have reopened successively, and about ten more factories are expected to resume operations in early June.</p>
<p>According to people in the silk industry, the spring cocoon season in Jiangsu and Zhejiang has ended. The summer silkworms in Linping, Pinghu, Fengde, Jiaxing in Zhejiang, and Wuxi and Zhenjiang in Jiangsu are hatching smoothly and developing well. The early batches of three-sleep silkworms are still feeding on leaves, and the late batches have also started feeding. If the weather does not change, a bumper harvest is expected.</p>
<p>The European and American silk markets, such as New York and Lyon, have been sluggish recently due to the hot weather. Silk weaving factories are planning to take holidays early, and current silk stocks are high. Most have stopped purchasing, so Chinese silk sales remain sluggish, and prices remain unchanged. Recently, the opening price for high-quality Shanghai factory silk is about 540 yuan per dan, and yellow coarse silk is about 330 yuan per dan. According to the cost calculations of the silk factories in this city, each dan still suffers a loss, so the future of the silk industry is difficult to be optimistic about.</p>

<p>Delegation Sent to the French Concession Police Station, But Still Ineffective</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that the Anglo-American Tobacco Factory Strike Committee workers had scheduled to host a reception for the agricultural, industrial, commercial, and academic circles of this city on the ninth floor of the YMCA cafeteria on Minti Niyin Road last night at 7 p.m., intending to organize a support association to resist the company long-term. Yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m., the French Concession Municipal Council discovered this and immediately sent police to stop it. The union then sent Standing Committee member Fei Kexian to the Lujiawan General Police Station to request permission, but to no avail, resulting in the failure to host the reception as scheduled. Yesterday, the Strike Committee received a second order from the Military Commission, stating: "A document was submitted, continuing to present that the Anglo-American Company disrespects the law and illegally shuts down the factory, with no solution in sight, and requesting urgent relief. It has been understood that the Shanghai Municipal Government has been instructed to investigate and handle the matter. You should be informed of this. The order is issued on June 23rd, 23rd year of the Republic of China, by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek."</p>

<p>The Sino-Foreign Relief Association on Renji Road was responsible for the project of converting the breach on the eastern embankment of Gaoyou into stone works. After the project was completed, the Jiangsu Provincial Government was requested to send personnel to inspect and accept it. The original letter from the Provincial Government to the Association and the report on the inspection and acceptance process are recorded below:</p>
<p>Provincial Government Official Letter: "According to the Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau, the project to convert the missing parts of the embankments at Tangjunlou, Miaoxiangkou, and Qigongdian on the Eastern Embankment of Gaoyou into stone construction has been inspected and found to be solid, well-constructed, and in accordance with the specifications. The Association, despite the difficult economic situation and the difficulty in raising funds, did not avoid difficulties and completed this important project. The project leaders carried out the bank protection work and strived for solidity. Since the start of construction, progress has been rapid. Before the flood season, this major project was completed, demonstrating effective leadership and dedication to public service. The aforementioned has been submitted. After review, this bank protection project is crucial for flood prevention and is extremely important for the livelihoods of the people of northern Jiangsu. However, the project is difficult and costly, and the province is facing the aftermath of disasters and is unable to bear it alone. We deeply rely on the Association's commitment to helping those in need and raising funds from various sources to achieve this great undertaking and create great benefits. The gratitude is not limited to the people of the lower reaches of the river. In addition to instructing that it be placed on file, a copy of the original document is attached for your reference. This letter is addressed to the Sino-Foreign Relief Association."</p>
<p>Furthermore, a report from Xu Dingkang, Director of the Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau, to the Provincial Government states: "I, the undersigned, have previously received instructions from your office stating that 'We have approved a public letter from the Sino-Foreign Relief Association stating that our association previously received a letter from your government discussing the repair of the missing parts of Tangjunlou, Miaoxiangkou, Qigongdian, and other places on the Eastern Embankment of Gaoyou and converting them into stone construction. Our association agreed to undertake this project as it concerns disaster prevention and good deeds. We have publicly appointed Mr. Huang Qinglan as the director and Mr. Wang Baohuai as the deputy director of the project. After setting up an office to prepare for construction, we sent a letter to your government through the Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau to place it on file. We have now received a letter from the Gaoyou office stating that the stone construction project for the three missing parts of Tang, Miao, and Qi has been completed according to the estimated styles and specifications. We should send personnel to inspect and accept them as soon as possible so that each work surpasses the standard and can be opened at an early date to complete the procedures. We correspondly request that your government instruct the Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau to jointly inspect them and order the local flood control personnel to strengthen the defense. I respectfully request that this be investigated and implemented promptly,' etc. After receiving this instruction, we ordered the Gaobao Section Engineering Office to order the flood control personnel to properly safeguard it and sent Secretary Shen Baozhen and Technical Officer Sun Choupei to jointly inspect it. Afterwards, according to the report from the secretary and technical officer, we arrived in Gaoyou and found that Tangjunlou, Miaoxiangkou, and Qigongdian had old brick and stone bank protection before the levee was breached on the canal. The levee was restored in the 21st year of the Republic of China, but due to time constraints, it was temporarily replaced with brushwood work. However, the situation was steep, and the flow was too strong. Now, the engineering to build a block stone slope bank protection has a slope foot that is still at the original site of the brushwood work. The slope decreases, occupying the main levee. The west slope is still in the east slope, helping to build it back into place. The levee surface is three zhang. The entire stone construction foundation is signed with three rows of wooden piles, with each pile two chi apart and each row one chi and five cun apart, forming a plum blossom shape. The slope surface is made of a 1:3:6 ratio of reinforced concrete cover, and the slope foot has a reinforced concrete bottom sill with the same proportions as the cover. In the middle, there is a reinforced concrete longitudinal reinforcement with the same proportions as the top and bottom, and every four zhang, there is a longitudinal rib forming a grid shape. Each grid in the middle is leveled with block stones, and the gaps are all filled with a 1:3:6 ratio of cement slurry, and the slope surface seams are also uniformly inlaid with stone construction. Both ends of the slope are built with wrapping heads. The lower sill is rounded and connects to the soil slope, and a reinforced concrete longitudinal rib is made on the outer end of the wrapping head, penetrating into the levee body to prevent water flow erosion. The Tang and Miao projects have 13 temperature expansion joints. Before construction, a dike and soil enclosure was built outside the levee foot to prevent water from rising and hindering the progress of the project. The entire project has a plan diagram that can be used for verification. The undersigned has now inspected and accepted them one by one according to the original plan. All earth and stone work measurements are more than the original estimate, and the materials are solid and the work is strong and the workmanship is proper. Before receiving the order, the undersigned respectfully reports the on-site inspection and acceptance situation and attaches two sheets of acceptance form for your review and transfer. This is a matter of virtue and convenience, etc. Enclosed is a piece of the acceptance sheet. It was found that Tang, Miao, and Qi in the eastern levee of the canal are located in Lincheng, a place of strategic importance. They were all levee breaches in the 20th year of the Republic of China. When handling the post-disaster project, the Sino-Foreign Relief Association allocated a large sum of money to undertake the main project of closing the gaps, and the association also built brushwood work on the three places near the river to provide protection. The association's spirit of public service and righteousness is commendable. After the project was completed, the bureau was deeply concerned that the new dike was not strong and the brushwood was easily decayed, making it difficult to guarantee its permanence. There was a plan to convert the brushwood into block stone to protect the bank, but due to the lack of financial resources, it was not easy to implement. The association once again generously allocated money to undertake the project. It is thought that the association is working on the project at a time when financial resources are exhausted and it is not easy to raise funds from all parties. It does not avoid difficulties and is able to complete this important project in order to achieve a permanent solution.</p>
<p>It shows deep concern for river defense. We are deeply grateful. As for the personnel in charge of the project, in addition to carrying out the bank protection project, they also strive to ensure that the work is solid and the materials are strong. They also consider the importance of canal traffic and do not hesitate to increase construction costs to rebuild the river enclosure so that the progress of the project and navigation traffic do not interfere with each other.</p>
<p>They also add an extra layer of bracing and broaden the embankment body to make it firmer. The planning is thorough and admirable. Since the start of construction, progress has been rapid. Each levee project was completed in the shortest period of time before the floodwaters rose. The project was carried out by the person in charge in an organized manner with diligence and a sense of public duty.</p>
<p>The actual situation of the Gaoyou eastern embankment stonework inspection conforms with the situation described above. I hereby write to report to Jiangsu Provincial Government Chairman Chen.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Rickshaw Pullers Support Committee's Plan <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The Public Concession Municipal Council's information office released a message, stating that recently, the rickshaw pullers in the Public Concession have been increasingly supportive of the Municipal Council Management Committee's reform plan. Representatives of rickshaw pullers visit the committee every day to talk. On the 25th of this month, 643 rickshaw pullers jointly submitted a petition, which stated in part: "Recently, rickshaw owners have been actively using the magic of money to buy off a tailor and a street stall vendor, pretending to be rickshaw puller representatives, in an attempt to oppose the various plans and implementation of your bureau. We implore you to severely punish them so that the various plans and implementation of your bureau can proceed. The hundreds of thousands of hardworking rickshaw pullers in the city, no matter what happens, vow to support the various plans and implementation of your bureau and vow to work together as a support. We implore your bureau to approve the implementation. For the purpose of reducing rickshaw rents, please limit the fee to ten jiao per day, plus one jiao for the rickshaw puller relief fund, starting from August 1st of this year. We also request that the rickshaw rent be set at eight jiao per day starting from January 1, 1935, in order to relieve the poor and save the masses from being perpetually oppressed by high rents and to prevent rickshaw owners from monopolizing and deceiving. Helping tens of thousands of rickshaw pullers is a public service that benefits both sides."</p>
<p>The committee also received a petition from a genuine rickshaw owner, requesting that the Municipal Council issue licenses directly in the future because currently, they are issued through a proxy donor who charges the rickshaw owner a fee of up to 15 yuan and 67 cents per license each month. The petition also stated that many rickshaw owners are suffering from this hardship and being exploited by the proxy donor, who does not own any vehicles himself. These rickshaw owners greatly desire the Municipal Council to issue rickshaw owner certificates so that the rickshaw owners can collect the licenses themselves. However, these proxy donors are currently trying their best to prevent rickshaw owners from coming to the bureau to collect the certificates in order to protect their illegal profits.</p>
<p>Although the proxy donors have such intentions, it is said that many rickshaw owners have come to the Municipal Council to petition and obtain certificates in recent days. As for the rickshaw owners who are hesitating and not collecting certificates, they may regret their miscalculation when the new licenses are issued in August.</p>

<p>Residents of Caojiadu and Zhabei Were Startled</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports that there are many Japanese factories in the extraterritorial roads near Caojiadu in western Shanghai. Since the January 28th Incident, Japanese naval marines have been stationed there for protection. Yesterday morning at 2 a.m., more than 200 Japanese troops, divided into dozens of armored vehicles and military vehicles, conducted a night combat exercise, driving back and forth along Gordon Road, Robison Road, Jessfield Road, and Brennan Road. Finally, they returned to the area of Caojiadu Wujiaochang, bordering the Chinese territory, to practice tactics and fire blank shots. At about 4 a.m., the troops returned to their camp in formation. The residents of Caojiadu and Zhabei across the Suzhou Creek were awakened by the sound of gunfire in their sleep and were deeply apprehensive. After the Sixth District Public Security Bureau explained, they were relieved. A reporter went to the Sixth District Headquarters yesterday to inquire about the details. According to reports, the Japanese side had sent a letter to the headquarters in advance to notify them and instruct them to inform the residents not to misunderstand. During the exercise last night, the entire exercise was conducted in the extraterritorial roads area and did not invade the Chinese territory. Therefore, in addition to dispatching police officers to monitor, no reply was given.</p>

<p>The case in which Tao Jia Yao, the former Governor of Jiangxi Province, was privately prosecuted by Gao Xiao Chen, the former Garrison Commander of Xiamen, in the criminal division of the Second Special District Court for fraud, was in the process of litigation when Gao unexpectedly committed violence in the court, assaulting and injuring Tao. After Tao sued Gao for assault in the same level court, the result of the trial was that Gao was sentenced to six months' imprisonment. Gao, dissatisfied with the judgment, appealed to the High Third Branch Court. It is now known that relatives and friends of both parties have come forward to mediate and reach a settlement. Lawyers from both sides have submitted statements to the court requesting the withdrawal of the case. However, Gao's case against Tao has been scheduled for trial by the Second Special Court today, and Gao's appeal case has been scheduled to open for trial tomorrow (29th). It is unknown how the original sentence of imprisonment will be resolved.</p>

<p>Polish nationals, Stanisieyski (transliteration) and Pour Horski (transliteration), were arrested by the French police last month in connection with the case of a large amount of jewelry stolen from the Siberia Jewelry Company at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Jiangxi Road in the Public Concession last year. Although they were found to have no suspicion of theft after interrogation, it was discovered that the Polish passport presented by Stanisieyski was forged, constituting the crime of forging official documents under Articles 229 and 133 of the Criminal Code. They were transferred to the Second Special District Local Court and ordered to await further verification on a later date. Yesterday morning, Judge Qiu Huan Ying continued the trial in the Criminal Court No. 8. During the interrogation, Stanisieyski stated that Pour Horski had lent the passport to a civilian, who had replaced it with his own photo and used it to go to Harbin and other places. He claimed he was unaware that it was forged. When questioned, Pour Horski stated that the civilian had bought the passport from a Jew in Tianjin for 25 yuan last August, and the civilian had taken it to Hong Kong, Guangdong, Fujian, and other places before lending it to Stanisieyski for his use. The Polish Minister to China, Weideng Te'er (transliteration), appointed lawyer Chen Ying to the court to represent and state everything. Judge Qiu verified the statements, announced the conclusion of the trial, and scheduled a sentencing date. The two defendants were returned to custody to await further instructions.</p>

<p>Mr. Wang Yansong, the General Manager of the Shanghai Silk Industry Bank, previously found it difficult to balance his public and private duties and resigned from his position as a member of the Supervisory Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on the 19th of this month. It is now heard that Mr. Wang also intends to resign from his position as Director of the Commodity Exhibition Center, which he held while serving as a standing committee member of the association, and has recommended Mr. Zhu Wenqi as his successor. The original letter from Mr. Wang to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is transcribed below:</p>
<p>To the esteemed members of the standing committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce,</p>
<p>I, Yansong, have completed my four-year term and am very pleased to have the opportunity to take a short break. However, I recall that when I took office as a standing committee member of your esteemed association, I also served as the Director of the Commodity Exhibition Center, and I am ashamed to say that I have not made any significant achievements. Now, due to the increasing complexity of public and private affairs, it is difficult to manage both, so I respectfully request permission to resign and give way to a more capable person. I have found Mr. Zhu Wenqi, a member of the executive committee of your esteemed association who has already completed his term, has been engaged in the domestic goods business for many years and has a strong enthusiasm for promoting domestic goods. If he can be given the position of Director of the exhibition center, he will definitely be able to expand his plans and achieve even greater success. I, Yansong, am incapable of managing the center but am sincere in recommending a worthy successor. I am sending this letter to you in good faith, hoping that you will carefully consider and grant my request.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Wang Yansong</p>

<h3 id="e152">Salt Farmers Exploited by Salt Merchants: The Hardship of Life Has Reached Extremes <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, recently, salt farmers in coastal areas have experienced salt-grabbing incidents, with Shandong and Hebei provinces being the most serious. Yesterday, someone from Qidong County across the river from Chongming in Shanghai said that the hardship of salt farmers' lives has reached extremes. The exploitation by salt merchants is almost unbearable, and they still cannot get enough to eat every day. In the richest salt-producing areas, the salt is all transported out, and the poor people have to spend money to buy salt. Qidong produces the most salt, but salt farmers lack salt to eat, so there are frequent incidents of theft and robbery. Those who sell illicit salt especially violate the ban. Therefore, salt farmers often have disturbances and conflicts with the tax police. It is hoped that those in charge of salt administration will urgently find ways to improve the situation.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Autopsy of Ding Yinshan's Suicide <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Ding Yinshan, a 50-year-old man from Hangzhou, was a partner in the Longji clothing store at No. 131 Fujian Road. For some unknown reason, he committed suicide by slitting his throat with a sharp blade the night before and collapsed on the bed, staining the bedding with blood. He was discovered by his partner Xi Wenzhong at around 7 a.m. yesterday. He was barely alive, so he immediately rushed to inform the shop owner, Xie Xianglin, who reported it to the Lao Zha police station. The police dispatched detectives to investigate and then sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. He soon died, and the body was taken to the autopsy room on Feilun Road. At around 10 a.m., Zhang Junqing, the prosecutor appointed by the First Special District Local Court, along with forensic scribe Wang Zuyi and others, arrived at the room to examine the body. According to Xie Xianglin, a 45-year-old man from Shaoxing, the deceased had been working in his store for five years. He was usually diligent, thrifty, and cautious, but he was quite stubborn. This sudden suicide was probably because his son and daughter-in-law came to Shanghai from their hometown and relied on him for a living. He resented that his wages were meager and that it would be difficult to support them in the future, so he resorted to this drastic measure. According to the statement of the deceased's son, Ding Sirong, Zhang ordered an autopsy and determined that the deceased, Ding Yinshan, was a male who had committed suicide before his death. The body was handed over to Ding Sirong to claim and prepare for burial.</p>

<p>According to Guomin News Agency, Tao Zhaodi, a young woman from Wuxi, 29 years old and graceful, lived at No. 18 Gujianong, Caojiadu, Shanghai. Last year, she was introduced to work at the Shenxin First Yarn Factory, leaving early and returning late, as usual. However, some frivolous youths in the vicinity had been coveting her for a long time. At 5:45 a.m. yesterday, Zhaodi got up, had breakfast, and left for work. On the way, she was suddenly intercepted and abducted into a car by Gao Shun'gen, a local resident living at No. 71 Gaogen Lane, and driven straight east. At that time, the sky was just dawning, and there were few pedestrians. No sound of Zhaodi crying for help was heard. Xie Chengzhang, a security guard from the Shanghai West Defense Corps, witnessed it with his own eyes. Because both parties knew each other, he was chatting with workers entering and leaving the factory. Luo Wenqing, the police officer from Post No. 39 of the Sixth District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, heard the news and reported it to the district chief, who forwarded it to the headquarters by telephone for filing. He also ordered a patrol officer to go to No. 71 Gaogen Lane to investigate, but Gao was not at home. He then went to Tao Zhaodi's home in Gujianong to inquire. It was said that Zhaodi was usually very well-behaved, but the exact situation was under strict investigation.</p>

<p>Kailin Paint Company, located on Jiangwan District Sports Association Road, covers an area of more than 30 acres and is the most significant paint manufacturing plant in China. Mr. Zhou Yuantai, the manager, has been studying various paints for nearly 20 years. His products are very excellent and are sold all over the country and the Nanyang Islands. Recently, he has been making unremitting efforts to improve his products, adding the latest machinery in various departments, which will be installed one after another. Not only will the output be mass-produced, but also the quality will make a special contribution. The pricing is still reduced as much as possible. The total assets of the manufacturing plant have exceeded one million yuan. The rapid progress of the company can be imagined. The board of directors decided to add another 250,000 yuan in new shares for the purpose of expanding business and popularizing domestic goods. This is indeed the best opportunity to invest in real industry. Therefore, those who invest in the factory and subscribe for shares are very enthusiastic.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning, the patrol boat of the Wusongkou Lifesaving Bureau recovered a male corpse from the coast. The corpse was about 30 years old with a flat top. He was wearing a grey wool long gown, white silk short shirt and pants, and a black wool single coat. His shoes and socks were neat. Judging from his condition, he did not accidentally fall into the water. He must have committed suicide by jumping into the river. He looked like a person from the upper class. However, it is not known why he resorted to this drastic measure. No family members were found, and the Shantang temporarily provided a coffin for burial. A small English ruler, seven copper coins, and a gauze scarf were found in the corpse's pocket. There were no other possessions.</p>

<p>The leader of the Detective Team in the Resident Area of West Shanghai, Wu Kezhong, and the deputy leader, Dong Wenrui, discovered on the evening of the day before yesterday that a secret gambling den had been established in the teahouse opened by Shi A'bao at No. 1157 Daxilu, inviting people to gamble by shaking dice, pai gow, playing poker, and mahjong all night long. Shi then profited by taking a cut. This had been going on for several months. Wu and Dong led detectives Yang Qing, Wang Yixin, Zhong Xuehuai, Huang Peilin, Wang Zhengrong, and others quietly to the address at around 11 p.m. The dozens of gamblers were in high spirits when the detectives blocked the front and back doors and then rushed in. Eighteen gamblers, including Xu A'bao, Li Xiaomao, Wang Guohua, Sun Mulin, Wang Xiangsheng, Tao A'bao, Wang Xigen, Lu Bingsheng, and Gui Xiaomao, were arrested on the spot. Gambling funds of nine yuan in silver dollars, two yuan and five jiao in fractional notes, and fifty-six jiao in fractional silver dollars, a deck of playing cards, and a mahjong set were seized. They were all detained in the Sixth District. After being questioned by Criminal District Officer separately, the documents were specially prepared and sent to the Bureau for interrogation yesterday.</p>

<h3 id="e158">Without Rain in the Rainy Season, Drought is Imminent: Rice Prices Soar to Over Ten Yuan <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>According to Shenshi News Agency, since the seedlings were planted this spring in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, except for the area north of the Yangtze River, farmers have been in great need of rain. However, the weather has been dry and lacking in rain. Therefore, farmers in the countryside have been busy drawing water. At present, the streams and rivers in various counties have been completely dry and depleted, and people are panicked. Since clouds and rain have not arrived, the strange phenomenon of praying to gods for rain has emerged again. However, despite sincere efforts, the sun is still blazing and the flames are scorching. There is not a single cloud in the sky to comfort the yearning. As a result, food prices have risen uniformly. The prospects are particularly worrying. A Shenshi News Agency reporter learned the following from the Grain Trade Association yesterday:</p>
<h3 id="e159">Rice Market is Firm <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The prices of both local and guest rice in this city are trending upward. Within a week, each dan has risen by about one yuan or more. Currently, the highest price for local rice is ten yuan and one jiao, and the lowest is eight yuan and one jiao. Among the guest rice, Jiangxi late-season machine rice is eight yuan and five jiao, Hunan rice is seven yuan and nine jiao, Wuhu rice is seven yuan and seven jiao, Hankou rice is six yuan and six jiao, and Shashi rice is six yuan and two jiao. In the past two days, the Fujian and Beiyang gangs have made large-scale purchases, and the market has become more active. If there is still no heavy rain during this yellow plum season, the drought will inevitably be more severe, and the price of rice will inevitably continue to rise. Shanghai citizens who have been eating cheap food in recent years are afraid that they will suffer the same hardship as farmers. Since the customs authorities have levied import duties on foreign rice, it has disappeared from the market and there is no market price. The 200,000 bags of foreign rice purchased by foreign merchants last year were later sold to rice shops in Doumi Street at a low price because no one was interested in them. Now, they are gradually becoming active, with an asking price of seven yuan and seven jiao. There is hope that the price will rise to eight yuan soon. However, importing foreign rice is still not possible under the current circumstances. With a rice tax of about three yuan per dan, plus shipping costs, the cost is too high and it is still difficult to sell.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Gu Xin Yi's Comments <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>According to Mr. Gu Xinyi, a leader in the grain industry, who expressed his views to a Shenshi News Agency reporter, the drought in various provinces today will inevitably affect the rural economy as farmers' autumn harvests decrease. He hopes that the government can use large sums of money to purchase and store large quantities of rice, wheat, flour, and other grains before the grain prices rise to the highest limit and distribute them to major cities in various provinces. When farmers lack food, they can be lent and sold at a fair price to alleviate their shortage, so that farmers will not be completely bankrupt due to the drought. This will be of great benefit to the rural revitalization work. He hopes that the government will take action quickly.</p>

<p>The Huangshan area is vast, and there are many scenic spots. If we talk about unblocking traffic and widely building pavilions, it is not something that can be achieved urgently. Moreover, the terrain, geology, water sources, plants, etc. have not been explored by experts. Hasty construction is also not allowed by facts. Therefore, based on the most urgent needs, a preliminary construction plan has been formulated. Except for items 12 and 15, it is expected that all items will be completed from July 1st to September 30th of this year, laying the initial foundation and gradually seeking progress.</p>

<p>The above is allocated from the income of rented land prices.</p>

<h3 id="e168">The Current Situation Under the Continuous Heat Wave: Asphalt on Roads Melts, Water Pipes Explode Due to Heat, Hospital Patients Surge, Rickshaw Pullers Faint <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 102 degrees, which was 1.7 degrees lower than the day before, but 17 degrees higher than the same day last year. Meteorological experts now believe that the heat wave in this city will gradually recede. Although it may return in the future, or even become hotter, it is expected that the maximum degree will not exceed the maximum degree in recent days in the next few days. According to meteorologists, the sudden heat was caused by a very dense layer of air sweeping in from the southwest, covering Shanghai and its surroundings, about 12,000 feet above the ground. This air layer is very mixed, so sunlight easily passes through. The heat emitted by the earth is usually scattered by various different air layers. Now, it suddenly increases the heat of the already very hot mixed layer. Therefore, it feels extraordinarily hot. For several days in a row, the asphalt-paved roads in the Concession have been melting due to excessive heat. Therefore, the Public Works Department of the Engineering Bureau has dispatched a large number of workers to spread sand on this type of road to facilitate pedestrians. The highest temperature on the surface of this type of road was 130 degrees on Sunday and increased to 140 degrees on Tuesday. It may have been even higher yesterday. The reason for the repeated increase is that the properties of asphalt retain heat. On Tuesday</p>
<p>At 1:00 p.m., when the sun was shining brightly, a 20-foot water pipe buried underground on Tiantong Road behind Gongji Hospital suddenly burst due to excessive heat on the ground. The water sprayed up to 80 feet, level with the roof of the hospital. Fortunately, no one was injured. Before long, the surrounding streets were two feet deep in water, forming a small lake. At that time, all kinds of vehicles detoured. The nearby playful children took advantage of this opportunity to bathe in the water. The water company dispatched workers to repair it that night. However, until the road is paved flat, Tiantong Road will temporarily stop traffic.</p>
<p>As a result of the continuous heat, the number of citizens suffering from heatstroke has increased sharply. At the Xizang Road Epidemic Hospital alone, there are already more than 300 patients. Not a few rickshaw pullers have fainted in the road due to heatstroke.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Fire in Xiafei Lane: A Girl Burned to Death. Is Keeping a Prostitute at Home an Omen of Bad Luck? The Girl Died Tragically with Her Abdomen Broken and Intestines Flowing Out <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Wang Zuocai, alias Guoguang, a 44-year-old man from Ningbo, runs a construction business. He lives at No. 48 Xiafei Lane, No. 927 Xiafei Road, French Concession. He has a wife, Chen (37 years old, from Suzhou), and a 10-year-old eldest daughter named Gendi, and two sons, aged seven and five. He employs several servants. Because his business is successful, he has made a lot of profit and can be called well-off. Recently, Wang married a prostitute from a small garden as a concubine. Originally, they lived in two places. Later, in order to save expenses, Wang moved the concubine into his home to live with the wife. Before long, there were disagreements between them. Wang moved the concubine out to live separately, but the couple often quarreled because of this. Neighbors in the lane were superstitious and said that Wang's keeping a prostitute at home would inevitably bring bad luck. Wang laughed it off. Unexpectedly, the superstitious words came true. At around 3 a.m. yesterday, the electric wire installed at the entrance of the second-floor pavilion room door of Wang's house suddenly caught fire and exploded. His daughter Gendi, who was sleeping alone in the second-floor pavilion room, was the first to notice it. She shouted loudly that there was a fire. At that time, Wang and his wife, two sons, and servants heard the sound in the bedroom and panicked. They each ran away. His seven-year-old son, in a fit of anxiety, jumped out of the window, causing a fracture of his leg bones. However, Gendi, the daughter who first discovered the fire, could not escape because the flames filled the pavilion room. After Wang and the others escaped, they realized that their daughter had not escaped. They heard a faint cry. They rushed up to rescue her, but the fire in the pavilion room was so intense that there was nothing they could do. The girl was buried in the fire. After the fire brigade received the news, they immediately drove a leather belt car to the scene and took water to extinguish the fire. Only one pavilion room was burned down, and the rest of the house was fortunately preserved. Afterwards, firefighters dug out the body from the rubble pile in the pavilion room. It was charred and burned, with the abdomen broken and the intestines flowing out, broken limbs and feet, and the skull shattered. It was unbearable to look at. The police sent detectives to investigate the cause of the fire and then took the body to the autopsy room of the Tongren Fuyuan Branch. Wang Ren, the prosecutor appointed by the Second Special Court, and a forensic doctor arrived at the room at noon to examine the body and determined that the deceased had been burned to death before her death. The official asked Wang and his wife about the cause of the negligence, and then ordered the body to be handed over to the family members for burial.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Private Possession of Hand Grenades: Wang Yingchun Sentenced to a Fine of 200 Yuan; Hand Grenades Confiscated <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Wang Yingchun, a native of Wuxi and employee of the hardware department of the New New Company, served in the First Brigade of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps during the outbreak of the Shanghai War in [blank] last year, distinguishing himself. After the ceasefire agreement was signed, Wang was discharged and returned to the company to continue his business. He brought with him two hand grenades, which he secretly stored in his clothes chest in the company's employee dormitory as mementos. He also removed the screw caps from the grenades to prevent danger. Recently, the company reported a theft of cigarettes and requested the police to investigate. Detective Yao Yuanlong and Detective Yang Peizhang went to the dormitory to search and found the two hand grenades in Wang's box. Wang Yingchun was taken to the police station and then sent to the First Special Court, where he was interrogated and detained. These facts have been reported in this newspaper. After Wang was arrested, the Shanghai Wuxi Native Association and the Shanghai Citizens' Federation of Nanjing Road, considering Wang to be a promising young man who had participated in national salvation efforts, and now facing legal trouble due to a mistake, rose to his defense. They hired three lawyers, Xue Dubi, Wang Chuanbi, and Lu Dingkui, to prepare his defense. Yesterday morning, the case was scheduled for a continued hearing. The three lawyers arrived in court on time. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated that the police had no new evidence since the adjournment and that the Western detective who conducted the search could testify to everything. The Western detective, Ma Yatou, testified that when they found the hand grenades on that day, the heads had indeed been removed, but the mechanisms were still in place and could still explode if something went wrong, although the danger was reduced. When questioned, Wang Yingchun stated that the heads of the hand grenades had been removed, but the gunpowder was still inside, and they would not explode if thrown on the ground. Judge Wu stated that while it was permissible to carry such hand grenades in the military camp, they should have been returned after discharge. Wang not only failed to return them but also concealed them without reporting it, which was dangerous. The defendant should not have kept them. Wang stated that they were mementos and had no other purpose. After lengthy arguments between the police lawyer and the defendant's lawyers, Judge Wu Tingqi ruled that Wang Yingchun possessed explosives without permission and imposed a fine of 200 yuan, and the two hand grenades were confiscated. Wang was granted permission to leave on bail of 200 yuan pending the appeal period, with Lawyer Xue responsible for his bail.</p>

<p>Wang Simo, the president of the Second Special District Local Court of this city, was ordered by the Ministry of Judicial Administration in April of this year to exchange positions with Ying Shi, the president of the Wuxian Local Court of Jiangsu. Ying immediately set off for Suzhou, and the new President Wang also came directly to Shanghai after the handover, taking up his duties immediately. It has been two months now, and his handling of court affairs has been remarkable. It is now known that Wang has scheduled to take the oath of office tomorrow (the 29th). Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Scheduled Inauguration: According to the chief clerk of the First Special District Court yesterday, since Wang took office, the court has been free of corruption and has been highly praised by his superiors.

In the future, if there are diplomatic elements in judicial matters when dealing with the French Concession authorities, it will be much more convenient. Therefore, the citizens of the Second Special District are very fortunate to have him.</p>

<h3 id="e179">Nine Large Cans of Stinking Water Concealed 180,000 Red Pills; Seized by the North Station Road Police Station; Two Traffickers Arrested on the Spot <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>The poisonous atmosphere of red pills permeates the country, especially Shanghai. Although Chairman Chiang has ordered military and police agencies to strictly investigate, traffickers are still emerging one after another, and their methods are becoming increasingly varied. At about 3 p.m. the day before yesterday, when the Shanghai North Station on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway was about to open for through traffic to Ping, Zhong Jianhun, the police chief of the third section of the railway police department, suddenly saw two rattan boxes left near the ticket office of the station. He thought that they had been left behind by a hurried passenger and immediately inquired about them one by one. Before long, two men came forward to identify them, claiming that they had been left behind by their friends and that they had been specifically asked to come and claim them, and that the boxes contained clothes and disinfectant. The police chief, in order to verify this, invited them to the stationmaster's office at the North Station and opened the boxes together with the stationmaster on duty. The contents of the boxes were exactly as they had said, but then he saw that there were no business signs or labels on the nine large cans of disinfectant, which aroused great suspicion. He then tested them with an object and found that they were indeed stinking water, but the weight seemed inconsistent. He immediately declared that they must be opened for inspection. Unexpectedly, the two men strongly opposed this, appearing flustered. The stationmaster and police chief became even more suspicious and quickly used a knife to cut open the metal cans of stinking water. It was then that they saw two packages of red pills inside, with a small tube connecting to the top, which was used to store the stinking water, to cover people's eyes and ears. The police chief and others, having discovered the concealment, proceeded to open the remaining eight cans in the same way, and all contained red pills, totaling eighteen packages, weighing seventeen kilograms, each package containing 10,000 pills, for a total of 180,000 pills. The metal cans were twelve inches high and six inches square, so their capacity was quite large. The police chief then took the people and the goods to the police station. After questioning, one of them, Liu Tongquan, 36 years old, from Luoyang, Henan, vaguely denied trafficking in drugs. The other, Liu Tongchi, 43 years old, from Luoyang, Henan, claimed ignorance of the source of the drugs, saying only that he had been invited by Liu Tongquan to go to the North Station to help him carry his luggage, and therefore did not know what was in the boxes. After verifying the statements, the section chief considered that the case was a criminal one and sent the suspects and the red pills to the local court for handling, and reported it to the headquarters, instructing all police chiefs to cooperate with the municipal police to strengthen the search and suppression in order to eliminate the scourge of drugs.</p>

<p>At 9:50 a.m. on November 18th of the year before last, Wang Zhentao, the owner of Maotai Xing Foreign Goods Store at No. 310 Xinzha Road, was shot and killed by members of the Iron-Blooded Anti-Traitor Corps for selling inferior goods. The police subsequently arrested the perpetrators Pan Hongsheng, Cao Songshou, and Tian Shuiyang, who were found guilty by the First Special District Court and sentenced to death and imprisonment. At 11:45 a.m. on the 15th of this month, detectives Ma Bingzhang and Wang Guangtian of the Jiaxing Road Police Station arrested Wang Zhaocheng, a native of Haining and the instigator of the case, in a house at No. 75 Anzhi Village, North Xizang Road, and sent him to the second criminal court. He pleaded not guilty and was detained for investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu Yugui presided over the trial.厉志山, a lawyer of the Public Works Department, stated that the defendant had two additional cases during the adjournment: At 2:45 p.m. on the 24th of the same month, he went to a foreign goods store at No. 339 Hankou Road and shot and killed shareholder Wang Yirong, wounding Wu Zhuxuan, using the same method. The defendant was identified by the three perpetrators, Pan, Cao, and Tian, who were arrested by the police, as the person who supplied the bombs and pistols for the Xinzha Road shooting of Wang Tao. Now the three perpetrators can testify. When questioned, the defendant firmly denied it, saying that he was indeed working for Mr. Chen Lifu in the capital at the time. Previously, he worked for only twenty days in Shanghai, in the preparatory office of the Citizens' Volunteer Army's Northeast Engineering Team, with sixty-four people, and then went to Nanjing, as evidenced by newspapers. According to the perpetrator Pan Hongsheng, he knew the defendant during the January 28th Incident. The defendant was not involved in the Wang Zhentao case on Xinzha Road. Cao Songshou and Tian Shuiyang said that they did not know the defendant. His name was revealed by a released Hua surname, and they falsely accused him at the police station. The defendant Wang Zhaocheng was defended by three lawyers, Jiang Yiping, Jiang Chiping, and Sun Biwu. Judge Liu ordered him to be returned to custody for further verification.</p>

<p>Since the Songhu Garrison Headquarters received Chairman Chiang's telegram strictly enforcing the drug prohibition order, Commander Wu Tiecheng has appointed Yu Youzhi, a technician of the Municipal Health Bureau and director of the Municipal South Clinic, to prepare for the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau Temporary Drug Rehabilitation Center. The site has been surveyed and determined to be next to the orphanage opposite the Longhua Garrison Headquarters.</p>
<p>Commander Wu has allocated 10,000 yuan for start-up expenses, and the monthly recurring expenses will be 2,700 yuan thereafter. The building is currently being renovated, and it is expected to open around July 10th. The interior can accommodate one hundred smokers, using the latest methods to eliminate drug addiction. The method involves injecting a liquid, causing a blister to form on the skin. The doctor immediately extracts the toxic water and then makes another intramuscular injection. This method of using poison to fight poison can completely eliminate opium addiction in about a week. Then, the center issues a certificate of abstinence, and the Garrison Headquarters releases the addict after taking a guarantee. If there is a relapse, the addict will be arrested and executed.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the trade associations of all industries yesterday, stating: "We are writing to you on behalf of the Women's National Goods Year Movement Committee, which was recently established. We are actively promoting national goods and sparing no effort to fulfill our mission of the Women's National Goods Year. However, due to the social custom of often buying foreign goods, the results of the promotion over the past six months have been limited. Recently, our committee convened a joint meeting of the Economic Work Committee and the Design Committee to discuss how to continue the promotion for the benefit of the implementation. It was agreed that national goods sellers and consumers must have a spirit of comprehensive cooperation in order to achieve the actual effect of promoting national goods. The daily necessities needed by families are often filled with foreign goods, and it is difficult to identify the marks of national goods manufacturers. As a result, once they are purchased, they may be found to be inferior goods. It is requested that all major companies mark all kinds of national goods with the manufacturer and its trademark, so that customers can easily identify them. We are writing to your association to persuade all companies and manufacturers to adopt this practice as soon as possible." The council believes that the proposal of marking all kinds of national goods with the manufacturer's name and trademark is indeed for the sake of easy identification. However, the council believes that foreign companies have set up factories in China under treaties, and the factory names are only Chinese characters, so it is not possible to judge which is a foreign factory. Therefore, it is best to also print the factory address and the names of the factory owner or directors on the packaging of the goods, so that people can know at a glance that they are products of a Chinese factory. We are sending this letter to inform you and hope that your association will pass it on to the factories of your members and implement it in a practical manner, so as to avoid difficulties in identification and make it easy for counterfeiters to fake the products.</p>

<h3 id="e191">Rent Reduction Dispute in Jinyu Fang <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Jinyu Fang in Dajing Lane, inside Xiaobeimen, is an old-fashioned building with one floor and one bottom. It was slightly repaired in 1933, and the rent was increased by 16 yuan per unit (from 25 yuan to 40 yuan). The rent of nearby houses before and after is only 13 yuan per unit, and the highest is no more than 20 yuan. The rent is the highest in the Xiaobeimen to Jiumudi area. Due to the economic downturn, the tenants of the Fang could no longer afford this huge rent. They organized a rent reduction committee in January and jointly requested the landlord to reduce the rent in writing. Not only did the landlord not agree, but he also used severe oppressive means and asked the lawyer's court to sue. Therefore, the tenants of the Fang had no choice but to discuss together and stop paying rent. Before the rent reduction was resolved, they temporarily stored the monthly rent in the Ximen Shanghai Bank for public certification. On June 9, Mr. Li took the initiative to mediate and agreed to reduce the rent. In order to settle the matter, the tenants of the Fang agreed to his request. Unexpectedly, the landlord demanded that Mr. Jin, who was enthusiastic about public welfare, be ordered to move out before the rent could be reduced. Therefore, Mr. Li was unable to mediate. Yesterday, all the tenants held a general meeting and decided that if a fair solution could not be reached, they would stick to their original intention and insist on it, regardless of any sacrifice.</p>

<h3 id="e193">Tailor Commits Suicide Due to Poverty <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Ding Yinshan, a native of Shaoxing who specializes in tailoring at Longji Clothing Store at Nos. 129-131 Fujian Road, 45 years old, suddenly cut his throat with a sharp razor at 7:15 a.m. yesterday and committed suicide. When people found out, he was rushed to Renji Hospital, but he died on the way. The store owner, Xie Changlin, reported it to the Laozha Police Station, and the body was taken to the autopsy office for examination. As for the reason for Ding's suicide, according to his colleagues in the store, Ding had been working in the store for five years, and his monthly salary was only about 20 yuan. He had always been extremely frugal. However, recently, Ding's son and daughter-in-law all moved to Shanghai, and all the expenses had to be borne by Ding completely, which made Ding feel economically pressured and resort to this tactic.</p>

<p>Yesterday, while dining at a friend's residence, this reporter saw a landscape painting hanging on the wall, with heavy and vigorous brushstrokes, unlike the work of a modern person. It was signed Shuangyu Taoist. When asked who painted it, the host said, "This is the painter Tang Dingzhi, whom you praised many years ago. I met him in Beijing more than ten years ago through Zhao Shengbobo. He is a very upright person and has a passion for tea. He has come to Shanghai every year since last year, and he often talks with me about the origins of ancient inscriptions and calligraphy until late at night. People only know that he is good at landscapes, pine trees, plum blossoms, bamboos, and rocks, but they do not know that his authentic cursive script and Han official script are almost indistinguishable from those of the masters of the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. His name is Di, the great-grandson of the Duke of Zhenmin and the grandson of Mr. Yue Min. He can be said to have carried on the family's learning." I asked what Shuangyu meant. The host said, "I will introduce him to you and treat you to wine another day."</p>

<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<p>[P Further Discussion on Building a Mass Language</p>
<p>Linguistics │ Answer to Mr. Wang Sheng-san │</p>
<p>Since we published an article "How to Build a Mass Language Literature," many readers have raised their opinions to us. For example, why is the mass language anti-classical Chinese, and at the same time anti-vernacular? What is the standard language of the mass language? We believe that these questions really need to be raised again for discussion.</p>
<p>We once said, "The current mass language movement is anti-classical Chinese, and at the same time, it is anti-bureaucratic comprador vernacular," because "the mass language is as opposed to vernacular as it is to classical Chinese." Although there is nothing wrong with this opinion in principle, it is a bit vague in saying it, and it does not precisely delineate the differences between them or correctly point out the unity of opposition between vernacular and mass language, which has led to misunderstandings among readers, who think that opposing vernacular is equal to opposing classical Chinese.</p>
<p>That is not our intention!</p>
<p>The development of language and writing, like social development, has its own specific procedures. If we want to understand how mass language and vernacular oppose each other and how they are unified, we can only understand it from the process of language development. We say that the mass language is anti-vernacular, because the vernacular movement has not completed its own task and achieved the success of "consistency between speech and writing." On the contrary, it has taken the road of surrendering to "literary language," becoming an obstacle to the development of language and writing. Just look at the popular vernacular writing now│not Blue-Green Mandarin, but a disguised form of the eight-legged essay (the so-called "quotation style") and there is a very large distance from the masses. Those young writers who sarcastically and abusively write "Damn it" and "Mom's" into literary works are no different from Wang Maozu's promotion of classical Chinese in terms of opposing the mass language.</p>
<p>However, saying this does not mean that ··anti-vernacular is equal to anti-classical Chinese, or that anti-vernacular, like anti-classical Chinese, has the meaning of denying all vernacular. No. We oppose vernacular in order to further oppose classical Chinese, and in order to further guarantee the victory of obtaining "consistency between speech and writing." In the "May Fourth" era, the mass language movement was included in the vernacular movement. Our opposition to vernacular does not deny the part that vernacular has achieved in the entire language movement; it declared the "death penalty of literary language" and pointed out the inevitability of "consistency between speech and writing" in the future. Therefore, in the current stage of building a mass language, we oppose vernacular's departure from the masses, but we cannot but critically accept everything in vernacular that is close to the mass language. After all, vernacular is different from classical Chinese, and vernacular is, after all, closer to the mass language.</p>
<p>So, what in vernacular should we accept? What is the standard language of the mass language? This question cannot be answered mechanically.</p>
<p>Language is not static, but is constantly changing with the progress of social life. The emergence of vernacular in the May Fourth era was also the starting point of the mass language. In this process, in the development of opposition between vernacular and mass language, the mass language gradually grows, while the vernacular of wealthy merchants and compradors becomes weaker and more exposed to its reactionary nature. If we deny the existence and development of the mass language in vernacular, we are no different from denying the meaning of the entire language movement, or even the cultural movement. Not to mention anything else, if we take the vernacular before and after the May Fourth period and compare it with the general vernacular now, and compare the vernacular of the remnants of the past with the works of mass literature writers, we can know which is closer to the masses. What is meant here by being close to the masses refers not only to language, but also to content. The masses here do not refer to the conservative masses, but to the progressive masses). This development of language and writing is gradual rather than sudden (the May Fourth vernacular movement can be said to be sudden), so we cannot easily see its form of development or point out a few works that can truly serve as the standard of mass language literature.</p>
<p>Answering the question of what is the standard language of the mass language in this way can lead to the same correct conclusion. Some people think that the standard language of the mass language should be the popular Mandarin, while others think it should be the vernacular popular on ships and trains. They all regard language as a static thing, and regard the development of language as unrelated to all aspects of the real life of the masses. They only see these elements that constitute the mass language, and mistakenly regard one element as the whole. We are now building a mass language literature, and we can certainly presuppose a standard language, but this standard language cannot be regarded as the future mass language, but only as the basis for this movement. The mass language grows in the real life of the masses. Mr. Xia Jizun said that farm women also shout "revolution," but it is not mass language, but during the Northern Expedition, farm women in parts of Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangdong really could talk about revolution, and we cannot but say that it was mass language. At present, language and writing still have great differences in themselves. What is understandable to read may not be understandable to hear, and what is understandable to hear may not be understandable to read. It is permissible for us to adopt a certain language as the standard language for this movement (this requires the efforts of linguists and sociologists). However, it is obvious that this is not the main point. We believe that the main tasks of building the mass language at the present stage are:</p>
<p>(1) To improve the shape-meaning characters and gradually turn them into phonetic characters, breaking the fundamental differences between language and writing;</p>
<p>(2) To improve the lives, culture, and enhance the vocabulary of the masses, so that the language of the masses and the general cultural development tend to be in a consistent pace.</p>
<p>Detailed explanations of these two points will be discussed later.</p>

<p>To Cultivate Submissive and Enslaved Normal School Talents</p>
<p>Scheduled to Open This September</p>
<p>(Northeast News Agency Changchun Telegram) Considering that medium and higher level enslavement schools are still lacking in the pseudo- "Xing'an Province," and that Mongolian scholars have traditionally tended to go to Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places to receive education in China, which is very detrimental to its enslavement policy and aggressive tactics, Japan recently incited the pseudo-Xing'an General Office to establish an Xing'an Academy in Wangyemiao, the former banner of Xike in the southern branch province, directly under the pseudo-Xing'an General Office, in order to cultivate submissive slave professions and enslavement normal school talents with its so-called "Wangdao Thought" and "National Foundation through Agriculture and Industry," so as to prevent students from studying in other places and complete its purpose of aggression. The content of the pseudo-school includes a three-year undergraduate program and a two-year normal school program. The qualification for admission to the undergraduate program is graduation from a high school and those with equivalent academic qualifications. The normal school program is for those who have graduated from the undergraduate program. The budget for the opening of the pseudo-school is 70,000 yuan, and it is scheduled to open this September.</p>

<h3 id="e218">Zhou Fo Hai Discusses the Implementation of Secondary Education in Jiangsu (Part 3) <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>I also have some opinions on this matter, and I must take this opportunity to explain them to everyone. In the past, many students created by middle schools could neither pursue further education nor possess productive skills, and were merely middle-class vagrants in society, adding a floating force to society and making it more chaotic. In order to remedy this shortcoming, we should promote vocational education or life education to cultivate students' productive skills so that they can live independently. On the negative side, this reduces the floating population in society; on the positive side, it increases the productive forces in society. In theory and principle, no one can disagree with this. However, looking at the current production environment in China, all production industries have not yet developed. Whether vocational school students will have a way out in the future is also a major question. According to the statistics of this province in the 21st year, the total number of vocational high school graduates in the province was 218. Except for 40 students from the business department of Shanghai Middle School whose reports were not available, only 99 people were employed, accounting for about 56% of the total. There are still 40% who cannot find a job. Although a small number of them pursue further education, many are still unemployed. Now that there are not many vocational school graduates, this phenomenon already exists. If vocational education is expanded in the future, and the number of graduates increases day by day, wouldn't this be another major problem? In addition to making the curriculum of each vocational school practical, training serious, and cultivating students' scientific minds and the skills of farmers and workers to meet the needs of social enterprises, I also ask that the province's various business institutions can accommodate as many vocational school graduates as possible. Because the talents trained with provincial funds are certainly for private enterprises, but if they can be used by the public, it is even more cost-effective. If the talents trained with provincial funds cannot gain a foothold in the province's various business institutions, it seems to deviate slightly from the original intention of provincial schools. This is a hope that I have based on the narrow employment prospects of vocational students in the past. In addition, there is another point, which can also be said to be a feeling that I have arisen because of talking about restricting the expansion of middle schools. Generally, people think that there are not many secondary school students in China. According to the statistics of the Ministry of Education, the number of secondary school students in China per 10,000 people is only 11, which is only one-fiftieth of that in Germany. The number of secondary school students in other countries is also ten times or twenty-thirty times that of China. It can be seen that secondary education in China, in another sense, seems to be allowed to expand naturally and should not be restricted in any way. However, I believe that the number of secondary school students in China at this time cannot be compared with other countries. Elementary education in various countries has almost reached the point of universalization, so they can further plan for the popularization of secondary education. Human culture is endless, so education is also endless. In the past, many European and American countries believed that four years of compulsory education was enough, and adult literacy education only taught the most basic reading, writing, and arithmetic. Now, the general trend is to extend the length of compulsory education to six or eight years, and the curriculum of adult literacy education, according to the literacy education promoted by the British Labor Education Association and various universities, is almost equal to that of universities in terms of high curriculum standards. In the future, the general trend may be to make secondary education compulsory, and secondary education in various countries will be completely popularized one day, and it will not only account for a certain number of people per 10,000 population. As for China, elementary education is still far from universalization. What we should strive for today is the development of elementary education. We can only gradually expand secondary education according to the needs of the environment. After elementary education is completely popularized, we can further expand secondary education. We must not ignore the foundation and compete with various countries across levels. We cannot but admit this inevitable fact. Therefore, I hope that all people with aspirations for education in the province will recognize this fact, start from the root, and strive to develop primary school education, instead of being ambitious and wanting to run middle schools at every turn. According to what I know, the number of private middle schools in Zhejiang accounts for 49% of the total number of middle schools in the province, and the number of private primary schools accounts for more than 50% of the total number of primary schools in the province. Private middle schools in Jiangsu account for about 50% of the total number of middle schools in the province, while the number of private primary schools only accounts for more than 9% of the total number of primary schools in the province. Comparing the two, we cannot help but admire the correct vision of people in Zhejiang who run private schools. In the future, people in Jiangsu who are enthusiastic about running private schools should not run middle schools, but try their best to run primary schools. This is my greatest wish, and I think it is also the common wish of the people of our province. End.</p>

<p>The [blank]th graduation ceremony of the National Academy of Music was held in the auditorium yesterday. There were three graduates in this year's class: Zi Huawenxian (vocal music), Lao Bingxin (piano), and Lao Jingxian (vocal music). After the ceremony was performed as usual, Principal Xiao Youmei, Ph.D., reported on the school's situation, stating that the number of graduates from the school was very few, because schools everywhere had a greater demand than supply for music teachers, and that as many as hundreds of students had dropped out of school midway to take up teaching positions in various schools. There are also countless people who are studying at this school while also holding teaching positions. Based on the above reasons, those who can graduate from this school are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns, and are even more difficult to obtain. However, I hope that from now on, all students will value art and knowledge, adhere to the spirit of perseverance, and tirelessly pursue their studies, so that the number of graduates in the future will increase sharply. Next, Principal Xiao delivered a speech on behalf of the Ministry of Education. Those who followed to deliver speeches included President Cai of the Central Committee, Mao Yunjun, representative of the Municipal Party Department, Luo Panhui, representative of the Mayor, and artist Yi Weiqi, all of whom spoke with great precision and encouraged reflection. Then, the graduating students delivered a reply. After the ceremony, the Russian singer Lu Jun performed several famous songs, which were soul-stirring. There were also photography and refreshments on that day. Teachers, students, and guests gathered in the garden, enjoying themselves to the fullest.</p>

<h3 id="e228">Lawn Tennis League Situation Tense, Chinese Association Expected to Retain Championship <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Association Loses to Inner and Outer Cotton Mill with a Score of 6 to 8</p>
<p>French Business Xiongtu Hegemony Wins Citibank 14 to 1</p>
<p>In yesterday's Lawn Tennis League, the Japanese Association lost to the Inner and Outer Cotton Mill with a score of 6 to 8, and the Chinese Association defeated Portugal with a score of 11 to 4. The future of the championship is very promising. The results of the four matches yesterday are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Chinese Association Defeats Portugal 11 to 4</p>
<p>(2) Inner and Outer Cotton Mill Defeats Japanese Association 8 to 6</p>
<p>(3) French Business Association Defeats Citibank General Association 14 to 1</p>
<p>(4) North Lawn Defeats South Lawn 8 to 7</p>
<p>Yesterday's match between the Chinese Association and Portugal was held on the Chinese Association's court. The Chinese lineup was greatly adjusted, and Portugal was very strong. The Chinese Association prepared for battle and won with a score of 11 to 4.</p>
<p>The first group was represented by Zheng Zhaojia and Yu Tianguang, who are a famous Chinese youth doubles team. However, due to their first collaboration this season, their cooperation was not perfect. In addition, their opponents Marcel A. Costa and Costa are good doubles players who are good at high pressure. Zheng and Yu made many mistakes and failed with a score of 1 to 2.</p>
<p>The second group, Wang Wenzheng and Sun Linfang, defeated their opponents Sunna and P. Costa with three sets of six to three, very easily. In addition, the Chinese team won three straight sets, which was the fifth group, Cheng Yize and Tang Yongchun.</p>
<p>In the third and fourth groups, the Chinese team each lost one point. Ma Anquan and Guo Xujie were demoted to the fourth group, and it was very appropriate to win all. Unexpectedly, they failed with a score of four to six in the third set. The third group, Zhou Guanjun and Zhang Dingzhao, also failed with a score of four to six in the third set. The overall result was 11 to 4, and the Chinese team won.</p>
<p>Zheng Zhaojia and Yu Tianguang (6 to 4, 2 to 6, 4 to 6) Marcel A. Costa and Costa 1 to 1 Wang Wenzheng and Sun Linfang (6 to 3, 6 to 3, 6 to 3) Sunna P. Costa 3 to 0 Zhou Guanjun and Zhang Dingzhao (8 to 6, 6 to 3, 4 to 6) Gang Shierfu Su Shi 1 to 1 Ma Anquan and Guo Xujie (6 to 4, 6 to 1, 4 to 6) Ge Tilie Xerfan 2 to 1 Cheng Yize and Tang Yongchun (8 to 6, 7 to 5, 10 to 8) Baulat Sbeitou 3 to 0</p>
<p>Also, the other three matches yesterday had changes. The French Business Association, which lost to the Chinese Association with a score of 6 to 9, unexpectedly defeated the Citibank Rural General Association with a score of 14 to 1, and the Citibank General Association was also defeated by the Chinese Association with a score of 6 to 9. The most noteworthy thing is that the Japanese Association, which is currently the most dominant, was unexpectedly defeated by the Inner and Outer Cotton Mill with a score of 6 to 8 (another set was unfinished). Therefore, the status of the Chinese Association has increased a lot. Currently, the Japanese Association has played one more match (15 sets) and is 8 points ahead of the Chinese Association, but the French Business General Association, although defeated by the Chinese Association, has a particularly high status due to yesterday's great victory, only one point behind the Chinese Association. The championship in this session will be contested by the Chinese Association, the French Business Association, and the Japanese Association. The recent situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Tennis Association 75 Sets 49 Chinese Tennis Association 60 Sets 4 French Business General Association 60 Sets 40 Portugal 75 Sets 36 Inner and Outer Cotton Mill 75 Sets 35 North Lawn 60 Sets 31 South Lawn 60 Sets 25 Citibank General Association 75 Sets 24 Xieqiao General Association 60 Sets 19 Attached The Chinese Association's results in the four matches it has played are as follows: (1) Bye, (2) Victory over Xieqiao General Association, 12 to 3, (3) Victory over French Business General Association 9 to 6, (4) Victory over Citibank General Association, 9 to 6, (5) Victory over Portugal 11 to 4.</p>

<p>(Reuters, London, 26th) Intermittent rain and cloudy skies prevailed today at the Wimbledon tennis tournament. The men's singles competition continued without any major upsets, although three of the four Japanese players have been eliminated. Attendance reached over 6,000.</p>
<h3 id="e239">Three Japanese Players Eliminated <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>Miki Lost to Turnbull: In the second week of the men's singles, Miki was defeated by Turnbull of Australia, 6-3, 6-1. Miki was completely out of sorts, unable to answer Turnbull's cannonball serves, often hitting the ball out of bounds or into the net. His performance was subpar.</p>
<h3 id="e240">Fujikura Lost to Haberl <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>

The sun reappeared in the fourth set, but Nishimura was out of form. The fifth set became a test of endurance, with Nishimura leading 4-1, but Siba caught up to 5-4. At this point, Nishimura was exhausted.</p>
<h3 id="e242">Yamagishi, the Only Remaining Hope <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>

<h3 id="e246">Go to the Interior <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>The bankruptcy of the rural economy in the interior is evident, and the weakness of the farmers' purchasing power is apparent. Shanghai, a hub of commerce and industry, is also suffering as a result, with its decline becoming increasingly noticeable. The financial sector is burdened with large amounts of capital and struggles to find suitable investment opportunities. The domestic goods industry is plagued by stockpiles and sluggish sales, leading to the hardship of stagnant inventory. Even more unfortunate is the existence of specialized talent without opportunities for development, leaving many heroes with no place to utilize their abilities. Given the state of China, the only path forward is to implement the "Go to the Interior" principle, which is essential to alleviate current hardships. Zhang Gongquan has advocated this principle to the nation. He recently traveled to Sichuan, known as the "Land of Abundance," for an inspection and tour lasting a month, and returned with great admiration. He believes that Sichuan is the wealthiest region in China, and it offers the most promising opportunities for the people to forge new paths. The people of Sichuan are determined to abandon the old notion of "Sichuan for the people of Sichuan" and embrace capital, goods, and technology from other provinces to develop this exceptionally rich region, aiming to rival England and the United States. This is the sincere desire of China's domestic goods industry, which must find ways to realize it. Zhang also stated that Sichuan's annual income is 120 million yuan, six times that of Jiangsu, China's wealthiest province, highlighting its immense wealth. Sichuan absorbs a large volume of goods annually, with cotton yarn alone accounting for approximately 120,000 bales. Sichuan people are major consumers of other domestic goods as well. Therefore, if we are to discuss domestic goods, we must not forget Sichuan. Zhang strongly encourages the domestic goods industry to jointly visit Sichuan for on-site observations and to establish trade connections. The reporter deeply sympathizes with this and sincerely hopes that leaders of the domestic goods industry will promptly organize a Sichuan Commerce and Industry Inspection Group to conduct research and share their findings. Organizing a Sichuan National Products Exhibition to stimulate the purchasing power of Sichuan people would also greatly benefit the progress and promotion of domestic goods. The reporter strongly urges leaders of various manufacturers to consider this proposal.</p>
<p>Talks on National Products</p>
<h3 id="e247">Bureaucrats and National Products <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Bai</p>
<p>In a previous issue of this publication, there was an article by Mr. Baling titled "National Products and Prostitutes." He argued that national products are dignified, while prostitutes are base. However, he further stated that if a respectable woman abandons the use of domestic goods and instead promotes foreign products, she is even more shameful than a prostitute. This made me consider the relationship between "bureaucrats and national products," and I would like to discuss their close connection in detail.</p>
<p>"Aiming high and admiring vanity" is inherent in human nature worldwide. We can find examples throughout our own history. When Guo Linzong of the Han dynasty encountered rain, he inadvertently folded the corner of his headscarf. People at the time imitated him, deliberately folding their own headscarves to take pride in it, calling it the "Linzong scarf." When Zeng Guofan served as the Governor-General of Liangjiang, he used a large, coarse palm-leaf fan to cool himself during the hottest days. The entire staff and people of Nanjing followed suit, abandoning delicate silk fans in favor of palm-leaf fans. This phenomenon is not unique to our country; it also occurs in European and American nations. Shortly after the end of the European War, when US President Wilson visited Europe, he rode in a car with the Queen of England. In haste, he inadvertently folded his cuff. Before the day was over, people throughout London were competing to fold their cuffs in imitation, demonstrating the significant influence of such actions.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can deeply understand that the actions of the upper class have a significant impact on the customs of our national population and the transformation of social trends. If they could strongly advocate "using domestic goods and rejecting foreign goods," taking the lead and setting an example for the public, the results would undoubtedly be more effective. However, what is the reality? It is far from our ideal. Past events have often revealed that large quantities of imported luxury goods are primarily consumed by those in political circles. Some bureaucrats, wearing foreign clothes, stand on the podium, preaching about saving the nation through domestic goods, while their actions contradict their words. Their shame is even greater than that of prostitutes.</p>
<p>Recently, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek launched the "New Life Movement," which includes the principle of using domestic goods, demonstrating its importance. Since he issued this call, there has been a nationwide response, with many eager to follow his lead. For example, Han Fuju, Chairman of Shandong Province, and Lu Diping, Chairman of Zhejiang Province, have made efforts to promote domestic goods and serve as role models for the public. If the entire political circle of our nation can thoroughly awaken from now on, embrace determination, and lead the public to take practical action, starting with those in political and academic circles, and then extending to the business community, and setting domestic goods as the standard for clothing and all consumption in the New Life Movement, then the future of domestic goods will be bright and predictable.</p>
<h3 id="e248">A Study of the National Goods Purchasing Competition <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Xing</p>
<p>In recent days, the newspapers have been promoting a very new term, which is "National Goods Purchasing Competition." This competition is sponsored by the China National Goods Production and Sales Cooperation Association and organized by the China National Goods Company. Their purpose is to test the enthusiasm of the Chinese people for using national goods. The competition will last for three weeks, from June 24th to July 14th. It is divided into three types of competitions: total competition, weekly competition, and daily competition. The method is to register at the competition office with invoices (excluding special goods and wholesale invoices) for purchases of products from various departments of the China National Goods Company that are worth more than ten points ││i.e., ten yuan.││ If you prefer to participate in the daily competition, then you can participate in the daily competition. For example, the first prize winner of the first day of the daily competition was 299.20 points ││i.e., purchases worth 299 yuan and 2 jiao.││ The first prize of the daily competition is a 100-yuan China National Goods Company gift certificate. The first prize of the weekly competition is a 200-yuan China National Goods Company gift certificate. The first prize of the total competition is a 500-yuan China National Goods Company gift certificate.</p>
<p>Now, let's take the example of the first prize winner of the first day, who won a 100-yuan prize for purchasing 299 yuan and 2 jiao worth of goods. It is undoubtedly a sacrifice for them. So why are they willing to make such a sacrifice? It is nothing more than to encourage the Chinese people to buy more national goods, so as to avoid the outflow of profits.</p>
<p>However, some people say, "I don't need so many things, and I don't have that much purchasing power. Although their prize amount is so high, it still doesn't benefit me at all, does it?" Because of his question, I did some research to answer him: "It is true that an individual's purchasing power is weak. I think you can join forces with your colleagues. Isn't there more than 500 people in your company? Let's say there are 300 people. In the summer, there are necessities such as undershirts and towels. ││This is a common example.││ At one yuan per person, you get 300 yuan. By participating in the daily competition with this amount, you can get a 100-yuan gift certificate. The 100 yuan can be exchanged for goods. If you take the usual purchase example, isn't this equal to an extra income?" My friend heard this and said happily, "Wonderful! Wonderful!"</p>
<p>This is an example of many people buying together. There are also consumer cooperatives, small capital firms, school shops, military units, agencies, etc. In normal times, they have to buy various goods for sale, or to give away as gifts. You can take this opportunity to buy from them in large quantities, and there will be extra income from the large amount of prizes. Isn't this a best opportunity? Moreover, if you don't win in the daily competition, you can participate in the weekly competition. If you don't win in the weekly competition, you can still participate in the total competition. If you don't win in the total competition, you can get a gift based on the total value of the invoices. Therefore, their slogan is "Winners of the competition get prizes, and those who do not win the competition get gifts."</p>
<p>Finally, I think their strategy this time is excellent and superior, and they are not afraid to sacrifice. This spirit is worthy of praise from the Chinese people. I think although Shanghai is a market full of foreign goods, after such a surge, some dreamers will awaken to some extent!</p>
<p>Discussion on National Products</p>
<h3 id="e249">How to Educate Children to Promote National Products? <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Dao</p>
<p>I believe in Ms. Ellen Key's words: "The twentieth century is the world of children." However, in the world of children, there is an urgent need for child-like teachers to educate them, just like a gardener irrigates an unopened rosebud. Plump fragrance and intoxicating color require strong assistance and diligent cultivation to unfold their color and fragrance. The importance of childhood can be seen in general.</p>
<p>However, innocent children have delicate minds, immature thoughts, and are most receptive to imitation and have strong memories. At this time, how can teachers educate children to get on the right track? It is an important key. Children mostly regard the words and deeds of teachers as vivid pictures, lively movies, and engraved words. They spend all day together, influenced by what they see and hear, and learn by example.</p>
<p>This year is the year of the child. At the same time, the situation of promoting national products is also showing a thriving phenomenon. In this period, if teachers impart knowledge of the nation to children, and instill the principles of promoting national products in them, the impression is extremely profound and the relationship is also very important. To solidify children's pure thoughts of promoting national products, to create children's basic concept of using national products, it all depends on this. As for the teachers, "How to educate children to promote national products?" It is indeed a question worth discussing, and it is also a huge responsibility that teaching should bear. I think we should pay attention to the following points:</p>
<p>First, we must adopt teaching materials that promote national products. The teaching materials for educating children should pay attention to the manufacturing of national products, the introduction of national products, the clarification of the theory of saving the country with national products, the revelation of the methods of promoting national products, and the guidance on the advantages and disadvantages of promoting the use of national products and the use of foreign goods.</p>
<p>Second, we must teach the methods of promoting national products. Promoting the use of national products is of course important for both consumption and production. Teaching methods must also pay attention to the use of both hands and brains, and the combination of teaching and learning. In normal times, we should instill more knowledge of agriculture and industry to children, guide children to make prototype handicrafts of agricultural and industrial products, and especially lead children to visit national goods factories, national goods stores, national goods exhibition halls, national goods exhibitions, etc. to broaden their horizons.</p>
<p>Third, we must implement the discipline of promoting national products. Whether direct or indirect, tangible or intangible, discipline can cultivate children's habit of using national products. For example, uniforms should all be made of national cloth, stationery should all be bought from domestic manufacturers, and national goods consumer cooperatives, national goods lecture groups, and national goods sales teams should be organized.</p>

<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>However, despite the busy work, there were never any mistakes such as delaying the serving of dishes or placing bowls and plates upside down. Don't underestimate them, readers! Their movements were truly somewhat militarized! When it came time to start the fire, the fifty cooks in Group C would all begin simultaneously. Because everyone's techniques were identical, the coal balls in the stove would ignite at the same time, and the temporary short chimneys would also be removed at the same time. The most interesting sight was when the fifty cooks in Group C bent over together, each using a palm-leaf fan to fan the flames, resembling the synchronized and methodical movements of boatmen on sampan boats.</p>
<p>Although these cooks were divided into Groups A, B, and C based on their positions, their attire was uniformly equal. They all dressed like eunuchs in the palace, except with white cloth sleeves. Therefore, in these four carriages used as temporary kitchens, the colors were as bright and eye-catching as in the other carriages.</p>
<p>In the past, people, regardless of their wealth or status, did not pay much attention to the cleanliness of the kitchen. The Empress Dowager, however, was different. When she was in the palace, she would often personally inspect the kitchen, so it was always kept very clean. This time, although the temporary kitchen set up on the train was small, cleanliness was still highly emphasized. I dare say that I have never seen such a clean kitchen. Even the floor was scrubbed so clean that there was no dust at all, almost clean enough to eat off of.</p>
<p>Two meals each day were designated as "formal meals," during which the full set of one hundred dishes had to be served properly. In addition to these two formal meals, there were also two smaller meals. Since they were called smaller meals, they were naturally not as elaborate as the formal meals. However, the Empress Dowager never allowed them to be too casual, so each smaller meal still consisted of at least twenty dishes, and usually around forty or fifty. (69)</p>

<p>— Hu Chenzhou</p>
<p>My small, rectangular nest has two windows of different sizes facing north. In front is the tennis court of the owner of the three-story western-style building over there, which breeds a large number of grass mosquitoes. Every night, thousands upon thousands of flying generals invade my room. Because my abode is not equipped with "wire mesh" like theirs, I am completely surrounded by them! They buzz and shout, attacking my entire body, leaving not a single piece of skin intact... It's no good sitting, and it's no good standing; I can't write. Thinking of Pi Rixiu's poem "Mosquitoes"... "Hiding, gathering like thunder, secretly sucking blood without satisfaction; if Heaven is not fair, tiny creatures will be taught to eat flesh. Poor scholars have no red gauze, enduring hardship, lying in thatched huts, why seek fatty food, with no grain in the stomach!" I hate them even more!</p>
<p>I remember Fang Xiaoru, who called himself Tiantaishan Sheng in the Ming Dynasty, once wrote a "Mosquito Dialogue." He described the mosquitoes... " ...like ants like flies, greedy mouths full belly, red and round..." He said that mosquitoes are as big as flies, which is probably the same as the "megalomania" of ordinary literati; let's not worry about it. Look, he used the words of his boy to tell a great truth..." ... Moreover, things eat people, and people eat things, they are different, it is still ok to say. Even mosquitoes are still cautious and afraid, not daring to show their shape in the daytime, peeking at people's invisibility, taking advantage of people's tiredness, and then asking for it. Now there are people of the same kind, who drink the same soup, raise wives and raise children, and the clothes and appearances are all the same. They are in the same category during the day and harass them, sucking their fat and smashing their brains, making them hungry, stumbling in the wilderness, wandering on the road, and the sounds of calling out to the sky are connected, and no one cares about them... "</p>
<p>Alas, according to this, people are not as good as mosquitoes, so why should I hate them!</p>
<h3 id="e254">Random Notes from Jade Ewer <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Da from Jiangnan</p>
<p>Mr. Jia Mingzhou, Chief of Staff of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army's General Commander Wang Delin's forces, came south on assignment to handle the post-war affairs of the families of the generals under his command. I met him at a banquet arranged by a friend. Mr. Jia is gentle and refined, and speaks with wit and elegance, not at all like a military man. Halfway through the meal, he spoke freely about the anti-Japanese situation of the volunteer army, his words filled with fervor and tragedy, moving and heart-wrenching, causing a patriotic feeling to arise spontaneously in people. It has been a long time since the public has heard the sound of resistance against Japan, and the newspapers rarely publish news about the volunteer army. The three characters "Volunteer Army" are almost forgotten. Who still remembers that thousands of miles away, there are still some patriotic heroes fighting bloody battles with the Japanese invaders day and night, hoping to recover the lost territory for their motherland? Mr. Jia spoke about an incident where his troops used burning chili peppers to repel enemy planes, which was very interesting. The enemy's superiority over us lies in their large number of planes and cannons, not in the combat effectiveness of their soldiers. The volunteer army mostly hides in deep mountains and remote valleys, forming a dispersed battle line, precisely because they fear being targeted by planes. One day, hundreds of soldiers from Wang's volunteer army happened to gather together, unexpectedly a large squadron of enemy planes suddenly arrived, having detected them. At this critical moment, their danger was unparalleled. Suddenly, someone, in a moment of desperation, came up with a brilliant idea, ordering everyone to collect countless chili peppers and pile them into a large heap, setting it on fire. In an instant, smoke and flames filled the sky, and the spicy fumes spread everywhere. This move was unexpected by the enemy. The people in the planes, upon smelling it, could not help but have their noses run and tears flow, unable to endure it. They were all shocked and quickly steered the planes away, thus the siege was lifted. However, they never figured out what the volunteer army had released. Everyone at the table laughed when Mr. Jia spoke about this. Mr. Jiang Baili, a senior military expert, was also present and couldn't help but smile, saying, "This can truly be called homemade poison gas."</p>
<p>According to a friend, among the families of Northeast anti-Japanese generals staying in Shanghai, there are many wives of high-ranking military officers. If they were in China proper, they would all be broad-minded ladies riding in cars, eating fancy meals, and being fawned upon by thousands. It is only because their husbands' blood is too hot that they reluctantly abandoned their families, disregarded everything, and willingly fought a desperate battle with the enemy, which led them to drift to a foreign land, destitute and without a home, relying solely on the relief of charitable organizations to barely make a living. Their situation is just like that of refugees. And looking north towards their homeland, their old homes have fallen into the hands of foreign invaders. Some people listen to the radio, while others appreciate the scenery thousands of miles away. Their husbands are still fighting for their lives in the midst of gunfire, and there must be not a few who have become figures in their spring boudoir dreams. This kind of feeling, even for an outsider to put themselves in their shoes, is still unbearable, let alone for those who have personally experienced it?</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 31 Three Encounters: White-Clad Soldiers Charge into a Snow Formation, the Entire Battalion Dies for the Country, Red-Eyed Soldiers Enter the Gunfire Forest. But in the first battle yesterday, Bao Fang not only disregarded this strategic point but also temporarily transferred Yin Deren's company from outside the city into the fort. This kind of battle plan clearly showed that his forces were weak and did not dare to advance. When the enemy attacked the fort yesterday, they also thought there were only two possibilities. Seven or eight times out of ten, they would fire a few shots and scare the Chinese away. One or two times out of ten, the Chinese would block them at a strategic point. But after fighting all night, the defending soldiers stubbornly defended the city, which was beyond the enemy's expectations. They had a total of only five or six hundred men, three hundred of whom were bandits who had been forced to fight at the front by machine guns. After fighting all night, sadly, eighty or ninety percent of these three hundred traitors who had been forced to die were gone. The sky was about to dawn, and the enemy was afraid of being exposed, so they retreated. However, in this way, the enemy also saw through that Bao Fang's battalion had no strategy or tactics to speak of, and was just stubbornly defending that village. On this day, they continued their strategy based on yesterday's situation. They felt that the terrain at the north gate was flatter, so they should still go around the gully to attack the north gate. In their attitude of despising Chinese soldiers, Zhao Ziqiang had already led his brothers to the gully. They all looked like old-fashioned filial sons, dressed in white from head to toe. Even their machine guns were covered with white cloth. The snow outside the pass never melts once it falls on the ground, except when the warm spring comes next year. The sun rarely shines in this gully, and the wind easily swirls the accumulated snow into it, so the snow here is particularly deep. (420)</p>
<h3 id="e256">The Philosophy of Clothing <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— Zui Chi Sheng</p>
<p>In today's contradictory society, the rich can pretend to be poor. It doesn't matter if their clothes are a bit old, and there are many benefits to it. 1) Pretending to be poor avoids the covetous eyes of kidnappers and thieves. 2) It avoids being asked for loans and spending money. Ordinary poor friends who don't know the truth will think you're one of them. Naturally, they will shy away and seek someone else. 3) As long as you have money, people will come to flatter you. Pretending to be poor will make many people praise you, saying you have "admirable frugality." Zhuangzi used to say, "Great wisdom appears foolish, great skill appears clumsy." I'll change it to, "Great fatness appears thin, great wealth appears poor." This is the way for the rich to live in the world!</p>
<p>But the poor must put on the airs of the rich. If you have a high or low position and are short on money, even if you have no food for the next day, you must pay attention to your appearance and wear beautiful clothes. Otherwise, if you are dressed in rags, even if you are "learned and talented," people will still look down on you. They will even give you a cold shoulder and call you a poor ghost. When you go out to visit friends, you will "always be obstructed" and be given the cold shoulder. Even your career will be severely affected. "Only valuing clothes and not the person" is an unbreakable saying. As for if you are a "pretty boy" who wants to chase after the ladies, you must study the decorations even more. A modern suit is indispensable. Naturally, there will be members of the opposite sex who will favor you. "The poor pretending to be rich, the rich pretending to be poor," this is the "philosophy of clothing."</p>

<p>——A few cross-sections of Suzhou——</p>
<p>Making Things Difficult for Celebrities</p>
<p>Ever since Master Taiyan, the great scholar of textual criticism, bought a house and settled down on Jinfan Creek, becoming a rentier in a Western-style house, the celebrities of Suzhou who admired the Master, or the Master's disciples, had something to do. With the high mountain in sight, there was a way to admire him. Either they went to him for instruction or they hosted a banquet to welcome him. The Master originally came to Suzhou to escape the hustle and bustle of Shanghai, but after arriving in Suzhou, his seats were always full of guests and his cups were never empty. Even the telephone that was hastily installed overnight kept ringing all day long, making it difficult for the Master to achieve his wish to escape the noise. The other day, the Master was invited by a disciple to a banquet at the Langcang Yaji. When the wine was half-drunk, the host asked him to compose a poem on the spot to leave an immortal memorial of the grand event. The Master was originally a famous artist, and he dashed off a four-line ancient poem in one go, but the celebrities accompanying him felt greatly embarrassed! If they did, since there were pearls and jade in front of them, they would certainly not be able to write any wonderful words. If they didn't, it would be difficult to refuse the host's elegant intention. For a moment, the celebrities at the table felt uneasy! Buzzing sounds arose, and the cups and dishes were silent. But the next day, the news of this grand gathering and the Master's wonderful words were prominently published in the newspaper to highlight Suzhou's culture!</p>
<p>"Bone-Corroding, Soul-Melting" Negotiations</p>
<p>In this year of economic depression, especially in these months of May and June, the general business situation is even more blatantly showing the signs of economic depression! Especially the empty-stomach gaming industry. The two Beijing opera houses in Suzhou, one inside and one outside the city, have successively stopped performing, and the movie theaters are also doing poor business, so they have to bring in some song and dance troupes to attract customers with fleshiness, and publish deceptive words such as "Stark Naked" in the newspaper advertisements. In fact, under the inspection of the Public Entertainment Review Committee and the Public Security Bureau, a truly naked woman will never be found in a Suzhou theater or on the screen. However, the other day, it led to negotiations. A certain movie theater published "Bone-Corroding, Soul-Melting" in the film advertisements for the Wanhua Troupe. Who knew that this phrase caught the attention of the Chief of the Public Security Bureau, who specially sent a patrol officer to the theater to investigate, just how is it bone-corroding and soul-melting? Thus, due to the Chief's negotiations, the four words "Bone-Corroding, Soul-Melting" no longer met our eyes.</p>
<p>Welcoming the New and Sending off the Old is an Art</p>
<p>At the time when new officials take office and old officials step down, a group of local notables and gentry cannot avoid hosting banquets to welcome and send off, on the one hand, sending off the old officials with a farewell glance, and on the other hand, welcoming the new officials to show their enthusiastic welcome, so that they can have a way to advance in the future. This is a common practice everywhere, and Suzhou is even more a place where the upper and lower classes trust each other and the people's sentiments are harmonious. Therefore, in these days, when the County Magistrate and the Chief of the Public Security Bureau were changed at the same time, a group of social notables had to hold grand banquets to welcome the new and send off the old. The other day, at the welcoming and sending-off banquet in the Liu Garden, the editor-in-chief of a certain newspaper specially printed an article praising County Magistrate Zou Xiaogong's virtuous administration. The clean white paper had copperplate and eulogies, printed in a splendid manner, and the article also cited ancient and modern examples, combining classical and vernacular styles. However, it was flattering to an excessive degree, which inevitably caused contempt from the discerning. Thus, it aroused external reactions, and a few annotations were made to the article, turning a well-written and flattering article into a curse. The editor-in-chief shot himself in the foot and expressed extreme regret.</p>
<p>Seasonal Foods are Quickly Enjoyed</p>
<p>During and around the Dragon Boat Festival, there are many seasonal foods to eat, especially seasonal fruits. Green plums, yellow apricots and loquats, black lychees and waxberries, plus red Jinshan apples and russet American tangerines, are truly colorful and dazzling, and cannot help but arouse people's appetite. The local fruits of Suzhou, waxberries and loquats, are produced in large quantities, with those from Yaoshang in Guangfu and the Dongting West Mountain in Taihu Lake being the most famous. Among the dishes, although the shad is out of season, the fresh lotus leaves are already standing tall and transparent in the water. The steamed chicken with rice flour wrapped in lotus leaves is fresh, fatty, and fragrant, with a unique flavor. Xingla and soy sauce are also seasonal delicacies.</p>

<h3 id="e258">Finance: U.S. Purchase of Silver Inflates Currency Massively; Benchmark Gold Plummets Eight Dollars and Sixty Cents; Central Bank Injects Over a Thousand Bars, Still Difficult to Maintain <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, although there were no major changes in the overseas silver market, the gold market was weak due to unfavorable news, and sellers rushed in, making it difficult to maintain the ninety-dollar mark. The exchange market was loose and oversupplied, and the posted prices were raised, which also contributed to the decline. The Central Bank tried hard to buy spot gold at low prices, which was able to pull up the market, but the result was still difficult to maintain. In the morning, overseas silver market reports showed English silver contracted while American silver remained stable. The forward silver price on the London Metal Exchange rose by 0.5 to 1 cent, but the March silver price contracted by 1.2 cents. London raw gold rose by 1.5 pence, American cotton rose by 9 pounds, American wheat contracted by 0.5 points, and stocks rose by $1.54. Market sentiment was low, and pre-market trading fell to around $93. Reuters reported that the U.S. Treasury Department announced the total amount of silver purchased, which was paid for from the general fund and did not use the equalization fund. It also announced the amount of gold received according to the anti-hoarding order. This news had little impact. However, because dealers supplied U.S. dollars, the exchange market hardened, causing prices to fall immediately after opening. Then, due to advance knowledge that HSBC would post an increase of 12.5 points for English currency and 25 points for U.S. currency, market sentiment became even more depressed, and the ninety-dollar mark was broken. Banks were still bottom fishing, slightly fluctuating. Afterwards, the domestic market remained loose, and selling continued in the market. Bulls failed to rally and prices fell again. The Central Bank intervened to buy spot gold, which boosted market sentiment and was able to pull up the prices. Banks also took the opportunity to bottom fish and stabilize. The Seattle night market silver price was reported as rising 1.25 and falling 2.5 and unchanged. Market sentiment was not satisfied. Buyers were more enthusiastic and briefly broke through the ninety-dollar mark. However, market sentiment continued to be weak, and prices continued to fall. In the end, although the Central Bank came to buy spot gold, Reuters reported that the U.S. government was confident that the new silver purchase plan at the end of the year would inflate the currency by at least $94,050,000. Deiss said that the Treasury Department had purchased approximately 70,000,000 ounces of silver. The printing office is now unable to rush to print new silver certificates. The Treasury Department now estimates that it will cost $94,050,000 to purchase 125,400,000 ounces of silver at a price of 75 cents. It also said that it would be difficult for the U.S. to purchase one-fifth of the world's silver at this average price of 75 cents. Market sentiment was even more timid, and the afternoon closed at the lowest price. The red gold price was $1,001.70. The swap spread was still being posted by the bulls at $1. Therefore, the Central Bank opened over a thousand spot transactions, and the price was half a dollar lower than the forward benchmark price. The market situation for the half day will be recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opened at $992.70, a decrease of $2.60 from the previous close. The goods opened at $2.50. The exchange market opened in the morning with the near-term selling price of English currency at 1 shilling 4 pence 0.0625 and U.S. currency at $33.75. The exchange market hardened. Chinese merchants tried hard to sell, and the October U.S. dollar at $34.125 was also difficult to sell. Zhaofengchang, Yuanchang, Yongyuan, Shengyuan, Yiyuan, Daxing, Yongheng, Yu Dadecheng, etc. continuously sold bars, and the price fell to $0.04. Hengyu, Sheng Datongchun slightly purchased at low prices, rising to $1.30. With advance knowledge that HSBC bank posted an increase of 1.25 points for English currency and 25 points for U.S. currency, selling became even more intense. Yuanchun, Dadecheng, Yingfeng, Hengyu, Qingyong, Qiyu, Yicheng, and Hengxing came to sell, and the ninety-dollar mark was broken, falling to $88.50. Sassoon sold the July U.S. dollar at $93.75. Dafa, Yongyifeng, Yongyu, Qingyong, Yongyongli, Hongli, Bingxing, and Dingkang purchased bars at low prices, rising to $9.40. However, because Hengyu, Tongchun, Yifengyong, etc. supplied at high prices, prices still fell. Banks such as Zhenggin and Magali ate the October U.S. dollar at $0.05. At this time, prices fluctuated around $9. However, market sentiment was ultimately weak. Banks also sold the near-term U.S. dollar. Shanghai Sumitomo sold the August U.S. dollar at $0.0625. Dadecheng, Hengyu, Yuanmao, Yong Dachangxiang, etc. came to sell, and the price fell further to $6.80. The Central Bank opened spot gold at $1.80, the price was $6.50.

Magali ate the October U.S. dollar at $3.125, and the price rose to $9.70. Hengtai and Tongchun continued to sell, falling to $8.90.

Later, the Central Bank opened into the current standard, and the bank also took the opportunity to cheaply settle the forward U.S. dollar. The Seattle night market silver price was reported to have risen less and fallen more, and the situation turned flat for a time, but it was ultimately difficult to support because Reuters had more silver telegrams.

<p>Upon investigation, the mid-year general settlement is only three days away, yet there is no hope for progress in silver and money business. All inflows and outflows are also unremarkable, but due to procedural matters, settlements and remittances are relatively complicated. Yesterday, the Shanghai foreign exchange rate opened at six cents in the morning and afternoon, showing no movement in the past ten days. The "劃頭" (a type of transaction) consistently lacked additional funds, resulting in a "white 劃頭" (meaning no gain). The volume of transactions for draft exchanges, morning market transfers, and new transactions exceeded 4.5 million taels, exceeding 500,000 taels in the afternoon market, over 300,000 taels in small general transactions, and over 900,000 taels in foreign pledge redemption transactions, with new pledges exceeding 1.3 million taels. Bank remittances included over 3.9 million taels in draft remittances by foreign banks, over 3.4 million taels in settlement remittances, over 700,000 taels in telegraphic transfers, and over 5.5 million taels in various goods and currency pledges and miscellaneous remittances, with 800,000 taels released from warehouses.

<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange's market still showed signs of unpredictable ups and downs. No. 4 bonds were still being sold, and No. 11 bonds were also released, but major investors were also absorbing them, making the market situation uncertain. It was also heard that the government was issuing a large amount of the 20-year Disaster Relief Bonds, causing some concern among investors. Additionally, the continuous sales of No. 4 bonds meant that while some investors were taking advantage of the low prices to cover their positions, others remained on the sidelines. Today, the market is closed for June futures delivery. August futures will be re-auctioned on Friday. If No. 4 bonds are no longer sold and Disaster Relief Bonds are not released, the market price should continue to rise. Currently, the market is temporarily under pressure, and some short sellers are taking the opportunity to escape, so the prospect of rising prices is somewhat diminished. The market opened strong yesterday morning, but due to the sales of No. 4 bonds, the enthusiasm was not as strong as the previous day. Various groups were actively buying, and Nos. 13 and 14 were also mainly bought. The 1920 Customs Bonds rose the most, by about four cents, while others rose by one, two, or three cents. Subsequently, only the Reverse Six Bonds declined slightly by one cent. In the secondary market, Nos. 4 and 11 continued to be sold off, and although Nos. 38 and 48 were being bought, the supply still exceeded demand. Short-term gold fell sharply by half a yuan, while others fell by two, three, or four cents. The market opened in the afternoon, and retail investors also sold off, and the situation remained weak. Military bonds fell the most, by four cents. Subsequently, short-term gold, Reverse Six Bonds, and 1922 Customs Bonds all rebounded by one to three and a half cents, and the trend turned upward again. The market closed with renewed strength. Conscription bonds rose sharply by half a yuan, while others rose by two to four cents. The resulting market prices showed mixed gains and losses, with only one or two cents difference. The total transaction volume was 9,556,000 yuan. The changes in prices are listed below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan). No delivery today, market closed for one day.</p>

<p>A report from Sin Fung &amp; Co. stated that yesterday (the 26th), the stock market was steady and firm. Demand for mining stocks was particularly strong. Hollinger Gold Mine reached $400.125, setting a new historical record. The market remained firm throughout the day without any signs of fatigue. The announcement of dividend payments by Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway provided a boost to investor confidence, mitigating any negative impact from the decline in steel production. At the same time, United States Steel Corporation also announced a dividend payment of $2. The small exchange saw some gains in public utility and mining stocks, rising several cents. (Bonds) Speculative bonds fell, while high-grade bonds rose. Demand for U.S. government bonds was strong, and foreign bonds were stable. German bonds improved, and French 7.5% bonds reached a new high. (Wheat) Prices initially rose due to unfavorable wheat harvest news, but later declined as speculators rushed to take profits. The total volume of transactions for the day was 620,000 shares. Furthermore, a report from the bank's New York agent stated that (securities) the market situation has recovered well, and the announcement of dividends by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway has provided significant support. (Wheat) In terms of the situation, it is still possible to buy when prices fall. (Corn) It is advisable to buy September and December corn when prices fall, as prices will be higher than current levels after July 4th. (Cotton) The market situation is firm, and the pressure from July sellers has dissipated. The weather is good, but a part of Texas is still too dry. Rising prices have triggered profit-taking and hedging by longs. (Rubber) Prices are firm due to purchases by domestic and foreign buyers. According to news from the Netherlands, production in the Dutch colonies is lower than previously estimated. (Sugar) The market is weak due to the large amount of raw sugar purchased last week, which has satisfied demand. The technical position is quite good. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed below:</p>

<p>The yarn market tended to decline in the morning and rebounded in the afternoon, but actual demand was relatively weak. The Tianjin group temporarily suspended operations, which softened investor sentiment. However, the funds absorbed by banks and money shops have not yet been released, so the market has no obvious flaws. However, Japanese merchants are shorting a large amount of 20,000 to 30,000 bales, which is putting significant pressure on the market. The price of Japanese yarn has also fallen, causing the market to tend to loosen. Based on the market situation, it is expected that the market is temporarily brewing and waiting for changes.</p>
<h3 id="e265">Standard Yarn Prices Show No Significant Decline <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>Standard yarn prices opened higher in the morning market. Because American cotton prices continued to rise and a major investor had absorbed a large quantity on the previous day, the market atmosphere was still tight. Near-term prices rose by three or four 角, but prices for distant contracts loosened by two or three 角. The reason given was that the price of Japanese 20-count "Blue Phoenix" and "Lima" yarn had fallen by one yuan, and there were also rumors of the Tianjin group shorting the market. This caused investor sentiment to change suddenly. Prices fell by six or seven 角 in the second and third rounds of trading, and the market remained weak at the close. As a result, prices for all months fell by seven, eight, or nine 角 to one yuan and two or three 角. The market opened weaker in the afternoon, with prices for all months falling by two or three 角. However, prices rebounded again at the close of the third session as rumors spread that a major factory was about to suspend operations, causing short sellers to cover their positions and longs to bid up prices. As a result, prices for all months rebounded by five, six, or seven 角. The total trading volume for the day was 36,800 bales. The sellers included Shenji (1,700 bales), Renfeng (1,700 bales), Yuande (700 bales), Junchang (750 bales), Taichang (550 bales), and Junchang again (350 bales). The buyers included Yuan Yi (1,050 bales), Dafeng (1,050 bales), Suilong (1,450 bales), Yichang (850 bales), Gengfeng (500 bales), and Yuanda (550 bales), and Yuantai (550 bales).

<p>Current yarn sales are relatively slow. According to statistics, all firms bought a total of 500 bales for the day. The market was similar to the previous day. The amount purchased by each firm is as follows:</p>
<p>South Seas 40, Ningbo One, Guangdong 22, Sichuan 125, Shantou 10</p>

<p>The cotton market initially fell but then rose, but the trend for new cotton is higher. Because the climate is dry, the development of new cotton is affected. Therefore, there are more new buyers. However, some believe that the current period is still too early and the relationship is relatively shallow. If there is no rain for another week, the damage will be significant.</p>

<p>The Standard Cotton market opened lower in the morning session. Although American cotton rose, there were not many buyers in the market, and the market tended to fall. Furthermore, there were rumors in the market that due to the hot weather, various factories were reducing work, reducing the need for raw cotton. Prices for all months fell by one and a half to two and a half 角. The situation was still calm in the afternoon. Old cotton rebounded by five to ten cents, and bulls increased their positions in new cotton, rising by one or two 角. The total transaction volume for the day was 60,900 dan. The sellers included Yi Ji (3,400 dan), Shen Ji (1,100 dan), Yicheng (1,700 dan), Hongchang (1,400 dan), Yuanxingchang (2,700 dan), Changhe (2,700 dan), Yuan Yi (2,200 dan), and Changfeng (2,300 dan).

<p>Yesterday, American cotton prices were firm due to the lack of rain in the drought area and poor cotton harvests. Buyers were enthusiastic, and the market situation was firm. As a result, spot prices rose by ten points, and futures prices rose by four to nine points. British cotton futures rose by eight points. Indian cotton prices were firm due to the unfavorable news about American cotton, and a few speculators bought. As a result, Pingal fell by one rupee seven and a half annas, Mula fell by two and a half annas, and Bairoxi rose by two and a half annas.

<p>After the flour market opened in the morning, many factories in the current month reversed their output, and the market price once reversed slightly. Following the news of rising prices in the north, and the Northeast Railroad about to open, market sentiment was even more激昻. Later, the market improved even more because the 銀錢帮 were buying standard long-month contracts in the market as much as possible. The situation in the afternoon market was full of rumors, and there were more outside囤買者进胃, so the market gradually rose, and the rising trend in the long-term market was even stronger.

The B-grade Double Eagle brand only stretched to five hundred thirty yuan, opening at fifty-five francs and a half, down one franc and a half franc. Sichuan and Shandong yellow factory warp and weft have both fallen one franc. The sales of European and American silk continue to stagnate. Because the weather is strangely hot in the European and American markets, the various factories have stopped work.

<h3 id="e281">The Current Stage and Future of the Mass Language Discussion <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— Fu Donghua</p>
<p>Recently, the debate between Mr. Wang Maozu and Mr. Wu Yan'yin regarding classical Chinese and vernacular Chinese (specifically in Shanghai) has sparked two reactions: (1) concern over the revival of classical Chinese, leading to a felt need to strongly protest this trend; (2) a related feeling that the "vernacular" of the May Fourth Movement had inherent flaws (though this feeling didn't just arise now), and that there was a need for another, more wholesome literary language to replace it. This other language, to express its difference from the "vernacular" of the May Fourth Movement, and to facilitate future discussions about its construction, has been temporarily named "Mass Language" by some.</p>
<p>Up to now, participants in this discussion seem to pay little attention to point (1). In his article "The Future of Classical Chinese," Ling Mo says, "I assert that this protest is ineffective." Indeed, with Mr. Wang Maozu's repeated emphasis on "social need" constantly giving classical Chinese a shot in the arm, how effective can this protest be? Because Mr. Wang's protest against vernacular Chinese isn't just "idle groaning" either. He sees that many people learn English only to prepare to enter British "offices," so what purpose is there in learning Chinese besides preparing to enter Chinese "offices"? And now, Chinese "offices," whether government-run, business-run, or joint government-business ventures, only want classical Chinese, not vernacular Chinese, so Mr. Wang can't help but worry about young people. Yes, in today's China, life forces people to "speak human language to humans and ghost language to ghosts." (Here, "human language" and "ghost language" are used according to Mr. Liu Dabai's interpretation.) Typical popular figures, mostly picking up chalk, can write "white" "language" on the blackboard, and once they put down the chalk and wave the goose-feather fan that Mr. Ye Shengtao talks about, they can pick up a pen also made of feathers and write "as per the above" on red-lined paper – only such people</p>
<p>will rise to prominence. So Mr. Wang's concern about the decline of classical Chinese isn't without reason. But unfortunately, today's young people may not – and aren't allowed to – all plan to enter "offices" to rise to prominence, so Mr. Wang's good intentions may not be widely accepted, then Ling Mo's saying that "there's no need to worry about vernacular Chinese now" is absolutely true.</p>
<p>However, Ling Mo's response to the question he himself raised, "Is there something else to worry about after vernacular Chinese is utilized," with a simple "not necessarily" answer, seems a bit too careless. Because although words and words will naturally "separate," as Mr. Erye said (see "Trends" published on June 20, "The Separation of Words and Words"), if an accountant or lawyer doesn't clearly separate them, problems are bound to arise. So, bringing up the problem of "classical Chinese" and "vernacular Chinese" for discussion again can be considered "leftover articles from the May Fourth era" (also Mr. Erye's words). As for discussing how "vernacular Chinese" and "Mass Language" should be separated, it shouldn't be a "complete misfortune," right?</p>
<p>Until now, no one has objected to the term "Mass Language," but no one has emphasized its importance either, at most treating it as a synonym for "vernacular Chinese." For example, in Mr. Long Gonggong's article "A Step Further" (see "Trends" on June 25), there is a place where "Mass Language" and "Living Language" are bracketed under the three words "vernacular Chinese," as if these three terms are indistinguishable. In fact, the problem that Mr. Long wants to "take a step further" to discuss is the problem of "the separation of words and words" that Mr. Erye mentioned, so it seems necessary to give another language that has separated from "vernacular Chinese" a name first.</p>
<p>However, a name is often given different meanings by people, so Mr. Long's need for "a step further" is very natural and necessary. So far, the explanations given to "Mass Language" include the following:</p>
<p>(1) "Language that the masses can speak, understand, and see clearly." (Chen Zizhan)</p>
<p>(2) "Only proposing speaking, listening, and seeing as standards, I think, is not enough; writing must also be considered." (Chen Wangdao)</p>
<p>(3) "For the sake of respecting the interests of the masses, all writing should be a combination of spoken and written language." (Le Sibing)</p>
<p>(4) "Mass Language is not created by anyone, but something that progresses with the progress of the lives of the masses." (Shen Bao Reading Q&amp;A)</p>
<p>(5) "Should be interpreted as a language representing the consciousness of the masses." (Hu Yuzhi)</p>
<p>However, because the two terms "masses" and "mass consciousness" are themselves too elastic, difficulties will still arise in discussions about practical construction. For example, the language that the urban masses can "speak and understand" may not be what the rural masses can "speak and understand"; also, can the hope of some backward rural masses for the appearance of a "True Son of Heaven" not be considered "mass consciousness"? Therefore, should Mass Language be allowed to occur and progress naturally, without any artificial "creation" and promotion? If our answer to the last question is affirmative, then all these discussions now are meaningless. Therefore, from the current stage of this problem discussion,</p>
<p>we can only grasp the following key points:</p>
<p>(1) "Masses" is a term opposed to all special individuals or special groups – from emperors to compradors – so the special language of all special individuals or special groups, whether oral or written, is not Mass Language. Classical Chinese, from the time it was used exclusively for writing, has been entirely the special language of special groups, so all classical Chinese is not Mass Language. "Vernacular Chinese," because it only takes "vernacular" as the standard and cannot defend itself from being utilized by special groups, "Vernacular Chinese" does not necessarily have to be Mass Language.</p>
<p>(2) "Mass Language" must learn from the masses on the one hand, and also be learned by the masses on the other, so its progress must at least have a little artificial help, just as the progress of history needs artificial help. For example, "lung disease," the most backward masses call it "wildcat fascination" (mythical), the next most backward masses call it "xu disease" (metaphysical), the standard Mass Language vocabulary should not allow the existence of these two terms, no matter how "vernacular" and how "living" they are. (As for novels describing the backward knowledge of the masses, of course, they are an exception.)</p>
<p>(3) For the reason of the second point above, it is currently impossible to "combine spoken and written language" (Mr. Hu Yuzhi has already said it), so the standard of "the masses must be able to understand" has to temporarily give way a little to the standard of "precise and accurate" advocated by Mr. Long (for example, in Beijing dialect, "automobile" is called "tram," and "gramophone" is called "talking box," both of which should be corrected in the Mass Language vocabulary). In other words, the scope of "masses" can only be narrowed temporarily. To be more specific, we can assume that the current level of education in higher primary schools is the standard for our Mass Language. As for the masses who are lower than this level and illiterate, of course, we still have to be more accommodating. Just as we sometimes don't use pronouns when talking to children, but language without pronouns cannot be regarded as standard language after all.</p>
<p>In the future, we hope that people can continue to "take a step further," "take another step further," and "take an even further step" to discuss this issue like Mr. Long Gonggong, gradually bringing up practical problems and solving them, and implementing them. Even if our protest is really ineffective, at least in the field of literature, we should first do a "clear the fields" work.</p>
<p>Finally, we must not forget that the people participating in this discussion now, in a certain sense, can also be regarded as a "special group," so whether our plan meets the needs of the real masses can only be judged by the real masses themselves.</p>
<h3 id="e282">Impressions of Zibo <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Wang</p>
<p>(3) The Old Man Next to the Mine</p>
<p>"Rely on the mountain to eat the mountain, rely on the water to eat the water." People who rely on mines can only eat mines. But some eat very fat; some eat very bitter. When the Zichuan mine was first opened, there was a big man carrying a peanut basket selling peanuts in the mine area every day; later, as the number of miners gradually increased, the business gradually improved, from a basket to a stall; when the mine's coal implemented a contract sales system, he boldly contracted one coal, and in less than two years, he made tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>This "big man rich man" is illiterate, but now his aura and conversation are such that no one can imagine his origins back then.</p>
<p>But he can still not forget the miners who helped him with their blood and sweat in the past, so he especially benefits the workers, helping those who have loans or illnesses. He also pities the miners who unfortunately died tragically without family members, and specially bought a large piece of charity land for burial. He is an "old man," and there are many workers in the "gang," so he became the chairman of the barren land chamber of commerce, the master of thousands of miners. The Shandong Provincial Government also erected a monument for him with the inscription "Benefits the People."</p>
<p>In addition, in Boshan, there are many more people who have made fortunes by transporting coal, from miners to rich people.</p>
<p>(4) The Sigh of the God-Carrying Team</p>
<p>When we visited the Dahuangdi coal mine, we first saw the Japanese people's houses and gardens, the cherry blossoms were in bloom, but the Japanese customs still existed.</p>
<p>There is a cemetery, planted with neat pines and cypresses, forming a wide cemetery path. Going up along the cemetery path, a conical sacrificial tower stands upright in the center, with the three characters "Memorial Tower" written on it, and under this tower is where the ashes of Japanese dead people are buried. There is a pavilion next to the tower, with a bell hanging inside, like an ancient temple. Another house, built with cement, was initially used to enshrine idols. It was established at the beginning of the revolutionary army's settlement of Shandong, the highest tide of the revolution! Therefore, a group of party department god-carriers took advantage of the dark night to smash those idols to pieces! Now the door has been sealed, and there is no god living in it!</p>
<p>But in other counties, superstition has recently revived. Based on hearsay, we have gained a little true news.</p>
<p>When the revolutionary momentum was very strong, the god-carrying team in a certain county in Shandong carried out their work very smoothly! Later, a group of pious men and women asked to automatically move the idols and seal them in a room outside the city, without destroying them. The god-carrying team agreed, so a group of superstitious men and women moved the gods back to the warehouse. When sealing the door, they muttered to themselves, roughly saying, "Dear bodhisattvas, please stay here temporarily. This is also a disaster. We will always avenge you in the future!"</p>
<p>Sure enough, in the 20th year of the Republic of China, a certain county suffered disasters repeatedly, and people said that it was caused by insulting the gods, so pious men and women jointly requested the authorities to return the gods to their positions! The authorities approved it, so they rebuilt the temple to welcome the gods, and the incense was revived, three or four times more prosperous than before, and the cost of superstition was no less than hundreds of thousands of dollars!</p>
<p>The revival of this Shintoism is a counter-evidence to the reversal of the times!</p>
<h3 id="e283">Upside Down Carrying <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— Gong Han</p>
<p>Western philanthropists are afraid of seeing animal abuse. If they see chickens and ducks being carried upside down through the concession, they will take action. The so-called action, although it is nothing more than a fine, as long as you are willing to pay, you can still carry them upside down, but after all, action has been taken. So a few Chinese people protested loudly, thinking that Westerners treated animals preferentially and abused Chinese people, to the point that they were not as good as chickens and ducks.</p>
<p>This is actually a misunderstanding of Westerners. They despise us, that is true, but they don't put us below animals. Naturally, chickens and ducks, no matter what, will always be sent to the kitchen to be made into a big dish. Even if they are carried upright, it will not make up for their fate of ultimately returning to their roots. However, they cannot speak, cannot resist, so why add unnecessary abuse? Westerners talk about everything being beneficial. Our ancestors thought of the suffering of the people being "hung upside down," and they really described it appropriately, but they have not yet noticed the disaster of chickens and ducks being carried upside down. However, they had already attacked the boring cruelty of "slicing donkey meat alive" and "roasting goose paws alive" in their articles. This kind of thinking is something that both East and West have in common.</p>
<p>But people's minds seem to be a little different. People can organize, resist, be slaves, and be masters. If they are unwilling to work hard, they can certainly be forever reduced to stagehands. If they are free and liberated, they can achieve equality with each other. That fate is not necessarily to be sent to the kitchen and made into a big dish. The more inferior people are, the more they get the love of the master, so if a servant beats a comprador, the servant is reprimanded; if an ordinary person offends a servant, the ordinary person is blamed. There are no regulations in the concession prohibiting the abuse of Chinese people, precisely because we should have our own strength, our own skills, and be completely different from chickens and ducks.</p>
<p>However, we have heard the nonsense of benevolent people and righteous men from the classics, to solve the suffering of being hung upside down. Until now, we still can't help but always think of a little grace falling from the sky or some high place far away. Even more, we think that "it's better to be a dog in peaceful times than a human in times of chaos," it's okay to become a dog, but we are unwilling to unite and reform. Those who lament that they are not as good as the chickens and ducks in the concession have this kind of smell.</p>
<p>If there are too many of these kinds of people, everyone will be hung upside down, and even when they are sent to the kitchen, no one will save them temporarily. This is because we are ultimately human, but we are useless people.</p>

<p>— Written by Hungarian poet Petőfi Sándor, translated by Shi Yongyi</p>
<p>A few days later, the people in that small village where this incident occurred were talking about almost nothing but the elopement of Mrs. Andrew and her nephew Karl.</p>
<p>"It's right to deal with that old man like this! Why did he want to marry such a young and beautiful woman?"</p>
<p>"This is really difficult for me! I can't solve this problem. Perhaps it's because they love each other."</p>
<p>"Really – I guess."</p>
<p>"However, I feel very sorry for that old man. If he dies of sorrow because of this, I wouldn't be surprised at all."</p>
<p>"Poor man!"</p>
<p>"This unfortunate scandal –"</p>
<p>In those days, conversations like these were very common in this small village, while Karl and his beautiful and young aunt had already met in Pest. Their carriage was just about to arrive at the hotel entrance, while another carriage was driving away from there.</p>
<p>"Ah!" Mrs. Anna screamed in panic.</p>
<p>"I hope he loses his sight," Karl thought to himself, hurriedly looking in the direction of the carriage. The two of them then wrapped themselves up well in their coats. The person who saw them was a merchant from their hometown.</p>
<p>"He won't recognize us," Karl said reassuringly as they walked into their room at the hotel. "If he recognized us, he would definitely greet us."</p>
<p>"Thank God, he didn't recognize us!"</p>

<h3 id="e285">Does History Really Repeat Itself? <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— Jia Wei</p>
<p>││ The Re-Enactment of the Debate Between "Classical Chinese" and "Vernacular Chinese" ││</p>
<p>From the "May Fourth Movement" to today, so much time has passed. And the debate between "classical Chinese" and "vernacular Chinese," at that time, had already determined the "victory or defeat." But today, there are actually people advocating "classical Chinese" again, and shouting the slogan of "Reviving Classical Chinese." In this way, some people say that this "old debt" will be re-examined.</p>
<p>True, the debate will certainly be re-enacted, but is this a repetition of history?</p>
<p>No, no, history will never repeat itself; however, due to the "stupidity" of mankind, they insist on repeating history!</p>
<p>Everyone must recognize that the decisive battle of the "May Fourth Movement" lay in the direct invasion of capitalism into China, which shook the very foundation of the inherent feudal system. At the same time, due to the needs of the objective conditions of society at that time, it was necessary to overthrow the dead language of "classical Chinese" and create the "recorded speech style." But at that time, only general intellectuals and the bourgeoisie under pure capitalism fought against the landed class and feudal remnants under the feudal system. Originally, no matter how the "victory or defeat" was decided at that time, due to the decision of objective historical conditions, with the increasing collapse of the feudal system, the "classical Chinese," which was the social consciousness pattern of its own, would inevitably decline with it.</p>
<p>However, due to the "stupidity" of mankind, today there are people who want to repeat history!</p>
<p>Indeed, today's feudal remnants are still powerfully and deeply lurking in all levels of society, so the sound of the "revival of classical Chinese" inevitably has a tendency to unfold with it.</p>
<p>Originally, the era is constantly moving forward, and social consciousness must also be constantly changing and evolving. However, if it is intentionally obstructed and oppressed by the strong force of mankind, the stagnation of social progress, and even the opening of a reverse gear, are all possible. Therefore, if we want society to progress and improve, we must strongly expose and attack this force. At the same time, we must first pay attention: writing and language are the hallmarks of every social consciousness, and they improve with the improvement of social consciousness. Therefore, in the need for our current stage of social consciousness, we must absolutely not repeat the history of the "May Fourth Movement," using the "foreign stereotype" vernacular of the general intellectual class and the bourgeoisie to fight against the dead "classical Chinese" of the current stage's "classical revival." We need to go a step further, with the evolution of social consciousness and the needs of the masses; we must build and advocate "Mass Language" to fight against the dead "classical Chinese," and at the same time, we must attack the "foreign stereotype" vernacular!</p>
<p>History never repeats itself, but due to the "stupidity" of mankind, they insist on repeating history. If we want society to improve and shorten its journey, we must attack and fight against all attempts to repeat history and engage in "reverse gear" behavior!</p>
<h3 id="e286">A Night Out in Early Summer <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— Xuan Ling</p>
<p>It was an early summer evening, the night before the full moon. The moon, like a small ball, was not as bright and lovely as during the Mid-Autumn Festival, but there was not a single cloud in the sky, and she was nakedly exposed in the mysterious outer space. In the distance, a vast expanse of yellow paddy fields seemed to have no end. Isolated villages floated on the yellow paddy fields, and faint, sporadic lights shone from the forest. I and Zhen were boating in a small river on a night tour.</p>
<p>The oar broke the calm surface of the water, creating a layer of foam and making a tinkling sound. Then, at the starting point of the oar, there were swirls, and ripples rose on this side and that side, gradually expanding until they disappeared far away. A gentle breeze was blowing, and strands of willow green on the shore were dancing on the water. The water plants by the river trembled in the wind, making a rustling sound.</p>
<p>We rowed the boat to the wide surface of the river, and I stopped the oars, letting it drift in the water. Zhen compared this scene to a night tour on West Lake, but regrettably, there were no undulating mountain shadows reflected on the water. We bathed in the quiet moonlight, washing away the vulgar feelings in our hearts. I almost forgot that I was in the human world. Everything around was quiet, without any sound; occasionally, a few barks of dogs came from the distant farmhouses. I took out my harmonica from my pocket and began to play melodious tunes in the silent fields. Zhen also hummed something, harmonizing with my musical tunes. We really felt like we had entered a fairyland.</p>
<p>Two boats pulling boats came from the other end of the river, with red lights shining in the boats, and the voices of women and children could be heard from the cabin. The surface of the water, which was originally as flat as a mirror, reflecting the scenery on the shore, was immediately disturbed, and the moon in the water turned into several large and small ones connected in a line, and then slowly moved together and merged into one. The sound of the rocking oar could still be heard faintly, until it was vaguely unclear. The air gradually became quiet again, and Zhen also fell silent, savoring the poetic beauty. The night was deep, with a bit of coolness, and we quietly rowed back in the boat.</p>

<p>— Jingbo</p>
<p>One summer evening, on my way home, the electric lights were already brightly lit. I passed several third-class small restaurants, places I had eaten at before, but I didn't feel like stepping inside at that moment. Was I hungry but didn't want to eat, or did I not feel hungry at all? Neither. I only had five copper coins and two dimes in my pocket. If I spent it all tonight, would I be drinking wind for lunch and dinner tomorrow? You might ask if I forgot to include breakfast snacks. Friend, you don't understand the economics of today's intellectuals. Breakfast snacks will have to wait until after the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation to be included in the budget.</p>
<p>Another small noodle shop receded behind me. Should I buy a bowl of plain noodles for twelve copper coins, or should I buy a cornbread bun for nine copper coins to take home? Before the dilemma was resolved, the distance between me and the noodle shop was already great. There's no need to go back for the noodles. I'll go forward to see if there are any cornbread buns. Too bad, I've already walked into the gentlemen's residential area. Even if a blind man sold cornbread buns, he wouldn't set up shop in these places. Let's move back toward home.</p>
<p>The plain noodle shop is right in front of me now. I'll exchange the two dimes for copper coins first, to avoid the noodle shop assistant saying the coins are bad. With a handful of copper coins, I called out, "Cook a bowl of plain noodles!" The portion was quite generous. The problem for tonight was resolved quite well. I'll buy a pack of cigarettes and go home to read.</p>
<p>The next morning, I looked at that reference book again. The issue I was researching hadn't yet formed a complete outline or concept. I'll take it slowly. I went outside. Several calm, elegant streets receded beneath my feet. The sun and I had more and more opportunities for trouble. I walked toward the bustling city, quickly resolving the lunch issue so I could go to the public reading room. It was getting late. Three small laborers had already occupied the first table, making a lively commotion. They were patrons of the noodle shop. The assistants were very insightful, knowing that if you didn't go to a restaurant for lunch and instead came to eat noodles, you must be penniless. Indeed, these three and I, although our clothes were different, generally couldn't escape the assistants' eyes. I ate and left, lit a cigarette, held it in my mouth, and strolled out. The leaves of the roadside trees cast some shadows, occasionally shielding me from the sunlight, which was at least a sign of sympathy for me. "Sugared Chestnuts! How much for a skewer?" I asked her. "Forty coppers." "Consider it." "Thirty coppers."</p>
<p>"No, thank you." Is it possible to not want it even at such a cheap price? It's not that I don't</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>want it, but the thought of sometimes having to pay thirteen copper coins for a bowl of plain noodles fills my mind. If I spend three coins, I'll only have twelve left. What would happen if I encountered a special price on plain noodles? It's better not to buy them. The reading room is almost here.</p>
<p>I stepped inside. Oh, there are quite a few people. I casually looked at several newspapers. There was nothing of value. I went to the magazine rack and took down the "Rural Issues" that I hadn't finished reading last time. Both the quality and quantity presented fresh facts and reliable statistics. It couldn't be considered anything less than a relatively good essay. I browsed, read carefully... The time was already past four o'clock. I couldn't finish it immediately. I left, to be continued next time. People were almost all gone, leaving only me and two others. At this moment, this room revealed the greatness of its space again. As I was about to leave, I flipped through a newspaper that I hadn't had a chance to look at when I first arrived. I flipped to the page covering the table, and oh! It was covering a long strip of white paper! I reached out to pick it up. It was heavy—copper coins!</p>
<p>Abandoned property—I'll take it out and use it. I don't need to worry about anything else. I have to live, and I'm researching an unresolved issue! I'll have a glass of soda first, a large one, a large one! I opened the white paper and counted—forty-six copper coins. I could definitely get two bowls of plain noodles. Not picking up lost property is the way of a gentleman. But for someone like me, whose three meals aren't guaranteed, being a gentleman would mean going hungry. I'll have to bend the rules a little. When I become successful, then it won't be too late to advise others to be gentlemen and implement a new lifestyle movement.</p>

<p>— Hong Ben</p>
<p>Chinese people mostly have weak constitutions. "Fair-skinned scholars" have always been revered, a clear illustration of the nation's weakness! The existence and continuation of more than four thousand years of history seems to be entirely attributed to so-called scholars. Leaving aside the present, this was indeed the case in the past. Once a person became a scholar, their life became particularly noble. Because of the nobility of their lives, they would inevitably have special authority in society.</p>
<p>However, these so-called scholars are actually useless people. The most useless thing about them is the frailty and uselessness of their bodies. Because of their frailty, even if they possess "world-shaking ambitions," they are often buried in their studies and often collapse halfway. What use are they? May I ask, can a weak and thin horse "bear heavy burdens and travel far"?</p>
<p>How exactly were the scholars of ancient times so frail? From birth, they were confined to their rooms like daughters of wealthy families, instructed to bury themselves in their studies. As they grew older, "diligent study" was praised, and they were told to study by fireflies and to persevere with diligence. Those who grew up in wealthy families often took marrying a young wife as a way to urge their sons to study diligently. Fathers only hoped that their sons would work hard in their studies, and sons felt that this was the only way, the only lighthouse to a bright future.</p>
<p>Little did they know that the reality was far from it. As a result, nine out of ten scholars were disabled—nearsighted, hunchbacked, skinny! Tuberculosis was the representative image of scholars. This is how society forced them to be. So, what kind of impression does society have of them? It is said... "A thousand times noble, ten thousand times noble, a fair-skinned scholar!" Their faces were indeed snow-white, but their bodies were too wronged. Thus, generation after generation continued in this way, and the result was that each generation was worse than the last.</p>
<p>Now, many people are clamoring that the Chinese nation is too weak and too decadent. In this "age of strength," where arms bump and fists meet fists, we certainly cannot stand at the top, not even on equal footing. We can only submit below.</p>
<p>The time has come for us to have a sudden awakening! The elder Cai Yuanpei is, after all, "old in years but not in spirit." In an essay discussing the essential qualities of modern students, he sincerely instructed us that if we want to be a modern and promising student, the first thing we must have is a</p>
<p>strong physique like a son, in order to shoulder the mission of the times. The Western philosopher said, "A beautiful spirit resides in a beautiful physique." This is indeed a golden rule and worth making our a resounding slogan, worth making our life's motto. Young friends, student friends, we are born in this perilous era. If we want to have a future in our careers, we must grasp this point! Otherwise, no matter how "fair" your skin is, it will be useless today.</p>
<p>So, how can we have a strong physique? This requires a "health movement." Actively, it starts with suitable exercise. Passively, it starts with health preservation and hygiene. Various ball games, to the extent possible, we might as well play more often. Our lives must be regular, and we must preserve our health at all times.</p>
<p>Society and the nation have many things that are waiting for us to work hard on in the future. We are also people who have a desire for a career. At this moment, we must prepare, prepare our physiques.</p>

<p>"Sister, stay here tonight, okay?" Ten-year-old Ju-zhen said, looking at her sister. Her sister seemed not to hear Ju-zhen's words and remained silent.</p>
<p>"Mom, is my sister staying here tonight?" Ju-zhen didn't get a response from her sister, so she turned to ask her mother.</p>
<p>"I don't know. Maybe she'll still go back after dinner," her mother replied faintly. At this time, the sky gradually darkened. The light blue sky gradually turned dark blue, then gradually darkened, finally becoming pitch black. The lights in Ju-zhen's house were turned on. After a while, dinner was served. So everyone gathered around the table to eat dinner. During dinner, the sister ate very quickly, as if she wanted to rush home after eating. Ju-zhen was very unhappy to see this. She thought that since her sister had gotten married, it had been difficult for her to spend a night at home. She was always very impatient and rushed home after eating dinner. Tonight, after dinner, she would definitely rush home again.</p>
<p>After dinner, everyone relaxed in the room. The sister and mother were talking. Ju-zhen looked at them and became impatient again.</p>
<p>"Sister, stay here," said Ju-zhen.</p>
<p>"I'm going back," the sister replied to Ju-zhen. Ju-zhen was very unhappy, only saying... "I knew it."</p>
<p>"Ju-zhen, your sister has to go back. She can stay here another day when she's free," her mother said to Ju-zhen very gently, as if she were comforting her.</p>
<p>The sister said goodbye to her mother and went back.</p>
<p>Ju-zhen listlessly walked into the room and lay down on her own bed. A question swirled in her little brain... Has sister's heart changed? Does she not love our home anymore?</p>

<p>— Meng Han</p>
<p>No plain wine, no fresh flowers, no meager offering, I only have a heart, a handful of tears, a painful and sorrowful heart and the resonance of tears!</p>
<p>You, you unfortunate one! Your life was too pitiful, your fate too cruel. Before life, in illness, after death, concerning everything about you... if humanity still had some sympathy and pity, then no matter who it was, they would inevitably shed a tear of sadness for you!</p>
<p>You and I did not know each other, nor did we have any deep feelings; it was only because you came here to sell your sweat, and I was in a position superior to you, able to shed a few drops of sweat and blood less than you, and had the right to inquire about some of your affairs. Alas, I truly repent that I did not know your condition earlier. It wasn't until you had been bedridden for seven or eight days that your roommate reported it to me, and I immediately sent you to the hospital. Who would have thought that in less than two days, you would die with resentment?</p>
<p>I originally knew that life and death were so ordinary, and that people were only so related. Dying from illness is not a tragic event; the one who died was you – a laborer not worth a cent – not a remarkable person. What can't be dismissed with a sigh? But for the past few days, I have always felt as if something has pierced this heart, which has been wounded so many times. Every time I hear some fragmented stories about your life and the various tragic scenes after your death, it tightens the trembling of my heartstrings, and I can't help but shed tears!</p>
<p>I heard that... your family was poor, with aging parents... In order to make a living, you traveled far to Shanghai to enter a factory at a young age, and now they all depend on you for their livelihood. Alas, think of your parents, how can you bear to close your eyes?</p>
<p>I heard that... you were only eighteen years old this year. If you had been born as a noble lady, it would have been the golden age of youth. You could have scorned and disdained everything... But you had to swallow your anger, endure hardships, and bury yourself in the factory, working twelve hours a day. Heaven is merciless, not even allowing you to live such a miserable life for long. What else can be said?</p>
<p>I heard that... while you were sick, you slept alone, moaning alone. It wasn't until five or six days had passed that one of your cousins in Shanghai came to see you. At that time, your condition was already very serious, but your cousin heartlessly left without caring. In fact, she also had unavoidable difficulties... She was like you, exchanging a day's sweat for a day's living. She had no money to hire a doctor for you, and she had no way to maintain a few days of life and give up her work to take care of you, so she had to leave in the end. Poverty is so heartbreaking that even relatives cannot take care of each other!</p>
<p>I heard that... after you died, no one came, and nothing was prepared. Although a letter was sent to your family, your parents never came, perhaps because they had problems even with travel expenses? In the end, the factory took care of everything, and the cost was only a few tens of dollars. The meager coffin and clothing can be imagined. Before life and after death, it was like this, how can it not make people sad!</p>
<p>Ah! The world is narrow! Humanity is ruthless! You, me, us, a group of birds of the same fate! We will all be driven by the world and abandoned by humanity! Death is just the end of everything! Is it pain? Or maybe it's happiness?</p>
<p>You lonely and helpless soul! Come back!</p>
