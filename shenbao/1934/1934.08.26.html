<h3 id="c44">白銀外流防止論之商榷 <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— 彤</p>
<p>自從本埠存銀大量外溢以來。似乎大家都抱着一些不安的心理。以爲白銀是一種貴金屬、流出過度。便不啻表示着國民經濟悲運的臨頭。於是有人主張採用各種方法。務必不使外流。如禁銀出口、如收購存銀。以提高銀價。如匯劃不收現。都是以這個目的做出發點的。這在「保管現金」的前提之下。意義上原無可厚非之處。但這樣的主張究竟有幾許可能的實現性呢。却是大家應當考慮的。</p>
<p>首先。就「保管現金」一點而論。在近代經濟組織中。保管的效用如何。實有特別注意的必要。很簡單的說來。誰都知道印度是一個存銀極富的國家。尤其是人民具有藏銀的癖性。但印度仍然脫不了殖民地的地位。日本所存的黃金。並不怎樣富足。但她的國際收支却常處於有利的階段。這樣說來。我們並不否認在現社會中集中金或銀的特殊意義。（如準備戰爭之類）。但我們所要指出的。是金或銀集中保管以後。對於國民的生產行程中能夠發生怎樣的一種作用。如果僅就金或銀的本身說。那不過是寒不蔽體飢不果腹的一種東西。我們當在這種觀念之上。去了解今日的白銀問題。</p>
<p>其次。我們對於美國這次抬高銀價運動的意義。還當有一番根本的認識。有人說。美國白銀國有的目的。是在於備戰。這是不錯的。但此外還另有一種重要目的。就是要在印度中國及其他遠東各用銀國家以內。和英日作市塲的競爭。以期推銷她的存貨。這只要看一看這幾天倫敦方面所傳來的關於英國匯兌平準基金通用的消息。便知道美國政策的反響如何了。因此。我們可以說。美國政策對於我國市塲的意義。是在於積極的擴張貿易。美國如此。他國也是如此的。</p>
<p>現在。我們再檢查一下白銀移運的意義究竟如何。很顯然的。這一回白銀的大量輸出。從一方面說。固然是由於中外銀價的差額過鉅。但從另一方面說。這完全是由於我國過于缺乏彌補國際收支差額的方法。以致國內存銀幾乎隨時有盡量流出的可能。根據同一的理由。因爲內地農村缺乏彌補差額的方法。所以內地的藏銀不能不滾滾流到以經營舶來品爲繁榮基礎的「都市」裏面去。這不是政治力量可以補救的現象。固然。我們不否認存銀或購銀的商人。以從中漁利爲目的。大足以妨碍「白銀保管」的原則。但我們要知道目前運銀的目的。根本就是一種販賣貨物的勾當。到了某一時期。他仍舊可以因有利而將貨物運回來的。他的根本動機就是要「將本求利」。至於現銀在什麼地方。他是不過問的。</p>
<p>那末。在這種情形之下。難道白銀就可任它大量流出嗎。那當然不是如此說的。在主張如何防止白銀流出之先。我們還得看一下我國國民經濟的現狀如何。誰都知道。有計劃的貨幣政策。只能在國民經濟發展到相當階段以後才有運用的希望。尤其在競爭激烈的今日。貨幣政策的後盾。不但要寄託在工業生產力方面。還得靠着政治外交軍事的力量如何以爲斷。像我們這種的國家。過去固然不免於「仰人鼻息」。從來不曾有過什麼貨幣政策。到了今日。難道就可驟然拿出什麼主張嗎。你如果怕白銀流出。說一聲不付他們的貨價。（戰時。當作別論）。要來實行一個劃賬的方法。試問他們會肯答應嗎。會不藉詞反對嗎。倘不如此。另想一法。停止銀本位。洋商們仍可以不受我國的一切命令。使一切計劃根本無從實現。</p>
<p>最後。我們還當從根本認識。現銀固然非保管不可。但國民經濟的出路如何。比這個問題還來得重要。如果國民經濟的狀態。不能比現在有什麼進步。現銀固然不能保管得住。即能保管得住。還是「無補蒼生」的。我們看一看近年來上海華銀行。從內地所收集的現銀是如何的充足。是怎樣的足以表示資金的集中。再看都市和農村的狀態如何。恐怕誰都不會有什麼滿意的結論吧。情形如此。即令白銀永遠不流出去。滿滿地堆在銀庫中。難道我國的國民經濟就可以有什麼前途了嗎。</p>

<h3 id="c115">德國六卅事變之內幕 <a href="#c115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— 無爲</p>
<p>＝左右翼勢力之分野＝</p>
<p>＝左翼方面陰謀一瞥＝</p>
<p>德國六卅事件、我國報章雜誌、雖已多所論列、唯其內幕究竟如何、至今猶爲一大啞謎、筆者披閱最近英美雜誌、略有所見、爰述如次、以供關心國際問題者之參考、</p>
<p>德國此次政變、簡單言之、爲國社黨左翼圖握政權之運動、不料希特勒消息靈敏、先發制人、此一運動、遂告失敗、希氏此種心靈手快之行動、頗博得一般崇拜英雄者之贊歎、實則德國國社黨左右翼之明爭暗鬥、已非一日、左翼之野心、固時時暴露、右派之應付、亦處處留神、否則希氏對於今次事變之應付、决無若是之敏捷也、</p>
<p>希氏預防左翼叛變之謀、早蓄於本年春間、其可得而見者、即二月二十五日國社黨開十四屆週年紀念會時、希特勒要求一百萬黨員、對彼個人重行宣誓、表示絕對之忠誠、就此一點觀察、國社黨內之左翼分化運動、已早爲希氏所預覺、故爲防患未然計、始有要求黨員重申信誓之舉、第二點、爲希氏命令戈林、於三月間組織秘密警察二十萬人、藉名防止黨外之陰謀、實則即所以預防黨內之叛變、此種秘密警察、或充侍役、或充門房、或充郵局書記、或充電話接綫員、形形色色、莫不俱全、以是一旦有警、希特勒無不知之、今次事變之所以能安全撲滅、亦全賴此種秘密警察之、可知報告希特勒對於左翼叛變之防範、早已成竹在胸矣、</p>
<p>希特勒之期望、原在使德國成一無黨無派之國家、顧國社黨之革命、雖已剷除敵黨、然於社會組織、則並未有所變革、社會層級、亦與其他資本國家無異、因階級利益之互異、遂生有政見之左右、因政見之不同、遂又形成左右傾之運動、此種跡象、可由二方面見之、（一）爲希政府之人物方面、（二）爲集團勢力方面、政府方面屬於右派者、爲外長牛賴資、財長葛洛蓆克Krosigk巴本、國家銀行行長沙赫德、經濟部長希米特Schmitt、希特勒於未上臺前、態度雖不偏不倚、惟一年以來、則日漸右傾、至於今日、實不妨列入此一集團也、屬於左派者、爲教長魯斯德Rust、不管部長兼衛鋒隊領袖羅埃姆、食糧部長達賴Walter　Dame、此外前屬不左不右之內長佛黑克Frick、今亦轉向右方矣、</p>
<p>至於集團勢力方面、其分野如次、德國現有之集團勢力、計有六種、（一）爲國防軍、（二）爲警察（三）爲秘密警察、（四）爲黑衫隊、（五）爲鋼盔團、（六）爲衝鋒隊、此六種集團中、前五種全爲右派之勢力唯衝鋒隊中、則有大部之左傾分子、固可視爲左方之勢力、試分述其力量、國防軍人數雖僅十萬人、然以服役時間長至十二年、故所受訓練之充分、實爲歐洲各國冠、加之人數旣少、軍械配備、遂得精益求精、故論其戰鬥力、實較歐陸他國之士兵、高出多多、此一集團、於興登堡未死前、頗依興氏意志爲從違、興氏本人、對於政治常取超然態度、故國防軍對於歷次政變、亦多不參預、惟究其傾向、實右方之中堅也、至於德國之警察、共有十五萬人、凡爾賽和約雖規定其不得受戰鬥訓練、然其受戰鬥訓練、實已爲公開之秘密、此種警察、普魯士佔其大半、戈林以普魯士內長之資格、具有指揮普魯士警察之權、故此一勢力、可謂全在希特勒與戈林掌握之中、成爲右派之力量、他如戈林所組織之秘密警察二十萬人、更無論矣、至於黑衫隊則爲希特勒由衝鋒隊中特別選出之忠實信徒、人數雖僅數千、實爲希氏最親信之隊伍、至若鋼盔團、原爲參戰軍人之一種組織、於希特勒登臺前、曾有一百萬人、初以胡根堡爲領袖、今則以汽水業家塞爾德、FrazSeldte爲領袖、希氏出任總理之後、即與聯絡、特委塞爾德爲勞工部長、此一集團中之人物、雖曾身經大戰、但其年齡、皆達中年、故思想實極穩健、與年少氣浮者、頗不相侔、以是亦爲右方之一大力量、最後之衝鋒隊、則爲希特勒一手所造成、其中分子、多年少氣盛之靑年、示威游行、高呼口號、是其特長、希氏未上臺前、與共產黨相搏戰、上臺以後、襲擊共產黨之機關、以衝鋒隊之力爲多、自去年三月希黨握得政權而後、共產黨與社會黨、受希氏之壓迫、頗多轉變黨籍、投身其中、其目的原在使衝鋒隊左傾、藉以求達其目的、於六卅事變未起之前、此一集團之人數、已增至二百五十萬人、其戰鬥能力、雖遠在國防軍警察之下、唯以人數衆多、故其力量亦不可漠視、</p>
<p>此六大集團之方面、旣已明瞭、則此次事變之內幕、亦不難窺見矣、蓋於希特勒統治之下階級層次、旣未變革、則政治人物與政治集團之左右傾、自屬難免、各種集團勢力、旣有左右之別、則其衝突亦自難免、今春以來、此種衝突、已數見不鮮、其一爲衝鋒隊與鋼盔團之衝突、其二爲衝鋒隊與國防軍之衝突、而爲之主動者、則確爲衝鋒隊領袖羅埃姆、蓋羅氏目擊衝鋒隊分子之日益左傾、頗思利用此種傾向、以取代希特勒、爲達此種目的計、自以先行併呑右派恃爲堅壁長城之鋼盔團與國防軍做起、本年三月、羅埃姆遂進行其併呑鋼盔團之計劃、彼先根據無黨無派全國一體之原則、要求希特勒下令使鋼盔團併入國社黨衝鋒隊之內、希氏當時認爲可以擴充已之勢力、故亦樂於接受、唯格於右方阻力、遂採折衷辦法、使鋼盔團改名爲國社黨參戰軍人聯合團、名爲國社黨、實則依然獨立存在、此後衝鋒隊與鋼盔團之間、水火枘鑿、衝突屢起、至六月十一日、鋼盔團領袖現任勞工部長塞爾德向鋼盔團訓話後、其所乘汽車、竟爲衝鋒隊員以石拋擊、並狂肆辱駡、塞氏以此事告知希特勒、希氏大爲不然、事後、羅埃姆復要求希特勒解散鋼盔團、或使鋼盔團全部聽受國社黨指揮、態度殊爲强硬、希氏本人時已右傾、且對國社黨中之左傾分子、深懷不滿、又覺羅埃姆別具野心、因予拒絕、此爲左右派衝突之一點、第二種要求、即爲羅埃姆許其部下於他日國防軍擴充時、補入國防軍、蓋英國軍縮計劃、曾許德國國防軍擴至二十萬至三十萬之境域、此點一待國際認可、德國國防軍、自將大事擴充、若照羅埃姆之計劃、衝鋒隊屆時即可遴選隊員、補充國軍、如是則衝鋒隊之榮譽地位餉給、皆能增高、唯國防軍方面對此、則大爲反對、蓋以國防軍之社會地位與平素訓練、逈非衝鋒隊之比、漫然加入、不獨有礙國防軍之紀律、且將降低其身價矣、希氏介於左右兩種勢力之間、十分爲難、同時因不滿衝鋒隊員之左傾、故寗願屈就國防軍之意見、對其一手造成之隊伍加以裁抑、其所定之步驟、一在撤換羅埃姆、二在裁减衝鋒隊、如六月初希氏所發之二種命令、即爲其預定計劃之初步、此二命令、（一）爲羅埃姆因身體失豫、給假一月、俾赴大瑪丁Dalmating休養、（二）爲衝鋒隊休假一月、休假期間、不准穿製服及集會游行、此二命令之用意、在解决羅埃姆之勢力、甚爲明顯、故羅氏當時迫於情勢祇得奉命前赴大瑪丁休養、然爲時無幾、又復潛回墨尼赫、密謀不軌、由是遂爲希特勒戈林等人所知、乃以迅雷不及掩耳之手段、解决羅埃姆等人之陰謀、</p>
<p>故此次政變、希特勒早已洞悉、防範應付、悉出預定、至希氏之右傾、亦因此次事變而充分暴露、本月七日巴黎路透電謂「八月一日、總理延見國防軍參謀總長費里資樞將軍、國防部長白隆堡將軍、及該部之里奇諾將軍、向之說明唯渠本人任國家元首、始能挽回內戰、並謂渠準備作一担保書、寫明渠就陸軍元帥職後、决不利用所居之地位、以歧遇國防軍、且担任削弱國社黨社會主義之傾向、及對於內國外交政策諸事、採納國防軍之建議」、云云、觀此可知希氏態度之所在矣、且最近希氏又將衝鋒隊由二百五十萬人、减至八十萬人、可見羅埃姆之叛變、亦全非羅氏一方之過也、</p>

<p>國聞社云、本埠今年氣候、旱熱交迫、七月十二日、酷熱達一百零四度四、開天文臺六十三年來最高紀錄、入秋以後、原望轉凉、詎前日氣溫最高至一百度後、昨又超過前日、驟增一百另四度、與上月最熱之日、僅差點四、昨午及午後二時半間、踞坐辦公室人員、亦莫不流汗如瀋、仰望天空一片蔚藍、毫無點雲、馬路間陽光四射、一般車夫苦力、喘息不定、衣衫盡濕、據天文臺云、該臺六十三年來、八月份氣溫、最高紀錄、爲一百零二度九、故今年已兩度造成新紀錄矣、</p>
<p>日來天氣炎熱、各時疫醫院診務又較繁忙、如西藏路上海時疫醫院、每日門診、仍近二百號之譜、病癥以吐瀉爲多、其次則痢疾瘧疾中暑者已稀、前日仍有四人死亡、昨日則未有、又開封路急救時疫醫院、每日門診約六七十號、病癥以痢疾與胃腸炎（卽吐瀉）爲多、昨曾有二例、爲中暑、死亡例已較少、虹口時疫醫院、現每日尙有門診三百號、以痢疾爲多、</p>
<p>內地旱象、據老農言、江南若此旱狀、僅咸豐六年有一次、但未有如此酷熱、且謂觀近數日來、入晚輒有濃霧迷空、據田家諺語、春霧雨、夏霧熱、秋霧凉風、冬霧雪、今則入秋有霧、而反酷熱、抑所謂秋行夏令、氣候之反常乎、實爲數十年來所罕遇見之氣候也云、</p>

<p>洋米訂購未巳</p>
<p>麵粉市價飛漲</p>
<p>日日社云、天時久旱不雨、米價高漲不巳、本市銀行界及米業界訂購洋米、巳逾一百萬石、而旱災省份、向滬承購者、亦屬不少、麪粉市價日來猛漲不已、此與旱災亦有關係也、</p>
<p>繼續訂購洋米　昨據米業界中談、此次訂購洋米、計有銀行界及米業界、其動機均屬出於調劑民食、而數額以銀行界爲多、報載已逾一百萬石、確有此數、近來各省來滬承購者仍多、本埠銷路亦暢、定價務使盡量從低、故目前所售出者、僅屬顧及成本、惟所謂奸商圖利、自所難免、社會局調查嚴密、並辦理登記、以資防範、現查向外商訂購洋米者、統計三日中、又有十萬石左右、米身以次等爲多、價格折合、較前不相上下、下月初卽可抵滬、</p>
<p>抑平米價困難　洋米進口、與國米運銷、以最近狀况、並無重大影響、蓋此項洋米、大半銷於內地、確屬需要、現查內地米船到滬者、每日僅有十餘艘、米商棧貨、除一部份仍未脫售外、存底漸薄、秋後天旱轉烈、需米更殷、故欲抑平米價、頗屬困難、</p>
<p>麵粉漲價暢銷　麵粉在本年四月間每包祗値一元二角五分、未及成本、當時廠商曾以虧耗頗巨、呈請政府救濟、及自天旱以來、市價連續高漲、最近更由每包一元九角飛漲至二元七角、復以銀行界大批購進、因之暴漲不已、日來每日成交、仍在一百萬包以上、各粉廠出貨、亦因之激增云、</p>

<p>决定濬淞計劃</p>
<p>蘇省採徵工辦法年撥八萬元</p>
<p>滬市由濬浦局及市政府分辦</p>
<p>關於疏濬吳淞江辦法、前經太湖流域水利委員會、擬定施工計畫、及預算書、電請全國經濟委員會、在棉麥借欵項下、撥欵辦法、迄今時逾半年、仍未見照撥、但吳淞江亟待疏濬、未便久待、茲聞疏濬辦法、現已由內政部及蘇省府滬市府分別商定、詳誌如下、</p>
<p>省市分濬　據新聲社京訊、疏濬吳淞江、現决定由蘇省府及滬市府分任、屬於江蘇省轄範圍一段、自吳淞江上游瓜涇口起、至老盤龍港止、卽該江上游工程、由蘇省府負責、仿照六塘河工程、採用徵工辦法、分期三年完成、所需經費、因淸理以前濬淞畝捐、事實上已不可能、故只得在八縣築路附加稅項下、年撥八萬元充之、至屬於上海市區範圍一段、自下游老盤龍港以東、至出口止、卽該江下游工程、除虞姬墩梵王渡兩處、裁灣取直工程、由市府籌辦外、其餘仍歸市府商由濬浦局繼續承包辦理、</p>
<p>市府辦法　又據本市消息、市政府勘估虞姬墩梵王渡兩處、裁灣取直工程、所需工欵、約計二十萬元、除由市府撥出五萬元外、其餘十五萬元、擬由市商會會同航業公會及內河輪船業公會等設法籌募、並經市府秘書處函達市商會查照辦理、</p>
<p>商會表示　市商會發表、以市區所屬之吳淞江、自新閘橋以東至外白渡橋出海一段、早於民國十三年間、由前上海總商會募捐負責開濬、祇以欵絀工鉅、勢難中輟、各縣畝捐、旣未能如期撥到、不足之數、俱由該會設法代借、迄今本息結欠至十七萬餘元、未能籌償、負累已深、如現在上項欠欵、能如數撥到、則商會尙可酌捐若干、以濟工需、至若另向各業募欵、則當此市面蕭條之時、實屬難能云云、</p>

<p>重行限定米價</p>
<p>討論積榖防荒</p>
<p>中央社云、自米價飛漲以來、雖經政府對於價格加以限制、並設法調節、但最近仍難見效、茲據本市社會局發言人語中央社記者、現以各處農田收成欠佳、米價仍有繼漲之勢、對於前定十三元限價、事實上已超出此數、故本局將於二十八日下午四時、在萃秀堂再行召集糧食委員會會議、除重行决定米糧限價外、并將討論積榖防荒事宜、至於報載中央政府將撥欵四百萬在上海等　處興建糧食庫、并限年內完工一事、本局尙無所聞、</p>

<p>汪氏談話　本報記者、昨晚晤及汪氏、據談、今日（卽昨日）醫師檢騐結果、糖尿成份忽增多三倍許、醫云、係暑期勞動過甚、未獲充分休養所致、記者當詢以汪院長下週將再赴廬山晤蔣委員長否、汪氏答稱、因身體關係、目下未能定奪云云、但另據可靠消息、汪氏確擬二十八日左右赴贛、</p>

<p>邱季才談銀價變動</p>
<p>我國現銀必繼續流出</p>
<p>銀價漲跌與大戰關係</p>
<p>中央社云、自美國政府提高銀價、並將現銀收歸國有後、我國現銀輸出、巳數達一萬萬元以上、此事於國家經濟及社會金融、關係至鉅、財政部現已聘專家、從事研究對策、中央社記者、以此往詢熟悉金融情形之邱季才氏、據談如次、</p>
<p>我國大批現銀流出　倫敦銀價之漲跌、與上海市價相差甚微、平時僅差十六分之一便士、此次因美國政府收買現銀、提高銀價、故兩地相差、意達兩便士之鉅、是以我國現銀大批輸出者、巳達一萬萬之數、預測尙有鉅數現銀、將繼續流出、因兩地銀價、相懸如斯之鉅、圖利者决繼續輸運、俾一轉手間、盈餘纍纍、此可斷言者也、</p>
<p>美國提高銀價原因　美政府提高銀價、收買現銀、任何人必測其用意所在、係作二次世界大戰之準備、蓋現代戰爭之勝負、雖表面上取决於槍械之利鈍、但實際上當以經濟力量爲斷、銀之用途、較廣於金、而戰爭時現銀之用途、更勝於平時、歐洲各國、都係用金國、歐洲大戰時、因金幣購貨困難、遂於大戰爆發後、收買現銀、致當時銀價高至九十便士、目前世界二次大戰之醖釀、幾如歐洲大戰之前一夕、大有一觸卽發之勢、美當局鑒於現銀之用途、殊足以决戰爭之勝負、故提高銀價、收買現銀、作事前之準備、此爲明眼人之共悉、而遠東用銀國家之現銀如我國等、遂大批輸出矣、</p>
<p>銀價跌漲關係至鉅　繼又云、銀價之高低、與全世界關係至鉅、是不能僅作商情而論、故此次美國提高銀價收買現銀、與歐戰時銀漲情形、實無分別、試觀一九一四年歐戰爆發、交戰國因不知銀之重要、互相收集現金、致銀價跌至二十二又八分之一便士、戰爭開始後、始知銀與戰爭之關係、銀價遂逐漸飛漲、至停戰後之一年、已高至九十便士、觀此益信提高銀價收買現銀之用意所在、邱氏並舉銀價漲跌與變動原因之事實列下、</p>

<p>向國外募衛生機械　該院建造中之房屋、因所募得之經費尙有限、故建築材料、如鋼鐵水泥、以及內部各種設備、均正向有關方面籌募義務捐助、俾得有極低之代價、而得極大之效果、至其中衛生機械設備、價値須在十萬元以上、已向國外籌募中、現有七十萬元、捐助在五萬以上者、計有宋老太太·江海關公署·濬浦局·銀行公會·錢業公會·及西人Sir　Elly　Rodone、及SirVictor　Sasoon等、捐助在千元以上者、計劉鴻生·顏惠慶·張杏村·正金銀行·匯豐銀行·劉陳寶眞女士·黃振東·嚴來蓮·開灤售品處·胡孟嘉·孔祥熙·杜月笙·英美烟草公司等、</p>

<p>挽回利權不少</p>
<p>吾國建築材料、什九仰給外洋、國產者絕鮮、昨據國際貿易局指導處主任季澤晋氏談、頃有化學師鄭汝翼、有鑒於此、於三年前手創雅禮製造廠、專製各種國產建築材料、以冀挽回利權、現出品已增至十二種、其最初問世之避水漿及透明避水漆二種、已使舶來之同樣貨物絕跡進口、並使油毛毡受絕大影響、茲該廠又有新出品三種、分誌如下、</p>
<p>膠珞油　水泥屋面、泰半採用油毛毡、不特價貴工繁、且色黑不平、而體質笨重、膠珞油係一種稀薄化學油、用時祇須塗於水泥平面、卽能得入微孔而閉塞、</p>
<p>避水漆　漏水之水泥屋面、修理非常困難、因水泥灰漿不能爲功也、自避水漿出、則此難題卽可迎刃而解、蓋無論何種破漏之水泥白鐵油毛毡屋面平台、一刷卽愈、非常省便、</p>

<p>— 吳鐵城</p>
<p>－－紀念先師孔子之意義－－</p>
<p>邇者中央以八月二十七日孔子誕辰、定爲至聖先師孔子的紀念日、以紀念孔子崇高偉大之人格、闡揚孔子博大精深的學說、振發萎靡浮薄之民心、挽救行將中絕的文化、我們全國民衆、逢此聖誕、繼往開來、應該如何猛省策勵、承繼先師孔子之遺志、負起大家歷史的使命呢、謹揭數義、以表著者景仰之忱焉、</p>
<p>年來國內趨時薄浮之士、每多菲薄孔子的學說、斷章取義隨意曲解、以爲不合時代的需要、甚至嬉笑怒駡、肆意侮辱孔子的人格、其塞宇宙間的眞理、决沒有什麼絕對的時代性、祗有眞客觀的社會性、而一個民族的生存、亦有其不可或撼的基礎、即爲歷史與文化、所以、總理雖主張激烈的革命、而總理對於民族所賴以生息蟬嫣的基礎、則非特絲毫不加摧毀、并且愛護唯恐不力、故總理演講復興民族的道理、一則曰必須恢復民族的自信力、再則曰、必須恢復并發揚吾國固有文化的精神、此今日我們紀念孔子、應有之基本認識一也、</p>
<p>考西洋近代文化的發展、國力的强盛、莫不曰導源於「文藝復興運動」（La　Renoissance）而文藝復興的原動力、則就是千年伏流的希臘思潮、歐洲的歷史、如用文化的眼光來透視、有兩大源流、一爲希臘思潮、一爲基督思潮、前者之特徵爲肉的本能的、知我個人自覺、自由主義、現世、人本位、自我滿足、自然主義、智識的、藝術的、科學懷疑、寔騐、客觀傾向、後者之特徵爲、靈的、禁慾的知神、絕對服從、教權主義、天國、神本位、利他主義、超自然主義、宗教的、道德的、信仰、獨斷、主觀傾向、希臘思潮、發源於二千六百餘年前、當雅典彼利格利（Peiscles）時代、最爲發達、而理智和情感、也能各得其平、及雅典之衰、羅馬繼之、則一變而爲極端利已的肉慾主義、淫蕩驕奢殘忍之風甚盛、基督思潮、救偏補弊、遂應運而生、基督雖以身殉、經三四百年而教大盛、然一尊旣定、流弊又起、僧侶壟斷學問以愚民爲事、拘拘於儀文禮節之末、而失其根本精神、那時的人、都做了僧侶的奴隸、這又造成了歷史家所說的「中古黑暗時代」、到了這個時候、千年伏流的希臘思潮、又乘時而起、而別開生面、重理智、尙自然、造成了近代科學的發展、尊個性、尙自由、促進了近代西洋政治社會的發展、於此可見一種思想、如果失其眞諦、則必流弊橫生、如果運用得宜、就能推助社會的進化、固不因古今新舊而變其値、這是今日我們紀念孔子、應有之基本認識二也、</p>
<p>在已往中國的歷史上、固代代掛着尊孔的招牌、其寔支配中國人思想的、不是孔子、而是老子、自漢以後、學風大壞、百家思想旣被壓抑、格致主義、更遭鄙棄、智識階級、旣憤於帝皇之不可期、富貴之不可得、大家抱了淸凈無爲的宗旨、忍耐退守的態度、從而造成了一種極端個人主義的頹敗性、極端浪漫主義的怠惰力、漢朝的學者、首重訓詁章句之學、晋魏六朝的學者、復倡黃老淸淡之風、及後、唐尙註疏、宋尙性理、明尙制義、淸尙考證、都是沒有認識孔學之眞義、談玄習靜、益趨空虛、醉心功名、絕無裨於國家社會的改進、頹風所被、又復形成一種社會的大惰力、把一般民衆的活動能力、進取精神、完全消滅乾凈、經過了幾千年長久的歷史、我們中國民族無論於科學上、於藝術上、於生活方面上、於組織社會、建立國家的方法和能力上、均呈衰退的現象、而未有長足的進步、所以我們今日要尋求我們民族所以衰落的因緣、非但不能歸咎於孔子、而正應該深痛孔學眞義之失墮、這是今日我們紀念孔子應有之基本認識三也、</p>
<p>孔子的學識、精深博大、非此短文所能述其萬一、然而孔子對於創造我們民族文化的功績、要爲一個公平的歷史家所無可否認、中國民族、在堯舜禹湯文武周公之時、可說是極有光榮的時代、堯舜禹湯文武周公、他們都懂得建設國家、組織社會的道理和方法、能努力從實際上把社會制度、國家制度創造出來、而逐漸謀其改善、從而奠定了中國社會進化的始基、然而那時的學術文化、非常散漫、雖經周公制禮作樂、創爲典範、然學術圖籍、猶藏諸宮府、還沒有普遍化、民衆化、孔子就能夠承繼堯舜禹湯文武周公的功德、把那時的各種文物制度、整理出來、發揚光大起來、使他學術化、系統化、普遍化、民衆化、集那時學問的大成、孔子復本其「誨人不倦」的精神、本着先王組織國家管理社會的原理、再去訓練民衆、感化民衆、使民衆都明白對國家社會應負的責任、并且本着致知格物、誠意正心、修身齊家、治國平天下的原則、確立了吾國自然科學、社會科學、倫理學、政治學的基礎、這種發揚文化、創建學術的天才和功績、尤其値得萬世的景仰、這是今天我們紀念孔子、應有之基本認識四也、</p>
<p>自新文化運動以後、時人所痛詆孔子最大的理由、莫過於所謂「吃人的禮教」、其實、禮的眞義如何、禮的功用如何、吾人仍有加以估量之必要、「禮者、義之實也、衆之紀也、禮者、因人之節、以爲民坊者也」、（以上俱見禮記）朱子以天理之節文、人事之儀則、言禮、禮之「原」、本乎性、就是所謂天理節文、禮之用、則顯於萬事而無不在、就是人事之儀則、前者則不變、後者則隨時而酌其宜、故曰五帝不同禮、故曰、孔子、聖之時者也、現在主張打倒禮教的、昧其原而不知其用、以爲有碍社會的進化、殊不知禮本可隨時代而變易、所以論到中國社會進步遲緩的原由、也不能歸咎於禮、而祗能歸咎於禮之誤解和誤用、况且禮和法的關係、尤爲密切、儒家認爲習慣支配社會的力量很大、若不能將習慣改良、一切良法美意、都成虛設、儒家提倡禮治主義的深意、是要使「人人有士君子之行」、法家說「勿責有自善之民」儒家正和他們相反、確信非有「自善之民」、則良好政治不能出現、儒家政論的根本精神、是要國中人人都受教育、都成爲「自善之民」、以養成國民人格爲政治上第一義、若從繁文縟節上、求禮、非但淺視了儒家、簡直是誤解了禮的眞諦（參看梁啟超先秦政治思想）中國自辛亥革命以來、一切良法美制、都慘遭失敗、現在挽救之道、祗有從培養與法治相適應的習慣入手、總理本其寔際政治的經騐、分建國的步驟爲軍政、訓政、憲政、三時期、而所謂訓政、也就是一種推行法治的準備工作、最近又因鑒於歷年一切政治革命的失敗、有新生活運動的勃興、新生活運動的功用、是在國民心理和生活的改造、以培養一種堪與新的法治社會相適應的生活和習慣、而新生活運動的基本原則、就是「禮義廉恥」、於此更可見孔子的禮教、正適合於中國目前社會的需要、這又是今日我們紀念孔子、應有之基本認識五也、</p>
<p>梁啟超先生在其批評胡適之中國哲學史大綱的演講中曾說、『我還記得有什麼「專打孔家店」的話、我以爲這種閑言語、以少講爲是、辨論問題、原該當仁不讓、對於對面的人格、總要表相當敬禮、若是嬉笑怒駡、便連自己言論的價値都减輕了、對今人尙且應該如此、何况是有恩於社會的古人呢、』今人時髦氣太重、每喜迎合社會淺薄心理、標新立異、不論是否適合國情、從而妨碍眞理的發展、貽害國家社會無窮的禍害、這種通病、尤望國人能反省痛改、庶不負國家紀念孔子之至意、　　　廿三年八月二十五日</p>
<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3 id="c174">再談雞生蛋的問題（續） <a href="#c174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>－－答胡傑等</p>
<p>對於這些循環不已的問題，我們如果只注意到眼前所見的現象，只把眼前的現象拿來爭論，是絕對沒有解决的，因爲一切眼前的事情都是從很多以前的事情發展下來的結果，一切事情都有很長的歷史的根源，如果我們只看見眼前的現象而不注意過去的歷史的發展，那麼我們就不知道這種現象的來源何在，不從歷史上找到眞正的來源，却把目前的循環現象拿來空洞一陣，那麼就爭辯幾千年，我們也不能决定雞和蛋是誰屬於誰。王載甫君的來信中曾說到有一個主張蛋生雞的人，他的理由是說「每個蛋都能生一個雞而每個雞却不一定能生一個蛋，（因爲有一半是雄雞）所以應該是蛋生雞，而不是雞生蛋」。這種說法，正是只注意眼前的理由而不注意歷史的發源所鬧出來的笑話。我們觀察任何事物，都必得要從它的發展上來看才行，前次我們關於雞生蛋問題的討論，就是站在生物的發展上面來說明的。我們曾說產卵的現象是生物發展到多細胞的階級以後才有的現象－多細胞動物未形成以前，產卵的事情也不會發生，所以最初是多細胞動物產卵，而不是卵生出多細胞動物，換言之，是雞生蛋（因爲雞代表多細胞），而不是蛋生雞（因爲蛋就是卵）。</p>
<p>關於其他類似的循環問題，我們也是要從歷史發展的根源上去探求，例如人類的思想和社會環境的問題，有的時候人類的思想可以影響環境，有的時候環境又能决定人類的思想，倒底是思想决定環境呢？抑是環境决定思想呢？又成了一個不可解决的問題，法國的十八世紀的機械的唯物論者就陷入這一種循環論裏而沒有法子找出路，他們承認環境能决定人的理性，同時又承認理性可改變世界，他們找不到出路，也就是因爲不知道研究理性和社會的歷史根源的緣故。但是我們現在已知道從經濟的物質的基礎上去研究社會的發展，所以我們現在已經毫無疑義地可以斷定是社會環境最先决定了人的思想。然後兩者又才互相影響。</p>
<p>關於前面說的個人養活家庭和家庭養活個人或個人與寄宿店老闆的互相關係的問題，我們暫且不說，請讀者自己研究研究，要怎樣解决。最好請讀者將自己的意見寫來給我們，然後我們再作一個切實的解答。</p>

<p>最近視察湖南職教改進意見（下）</p>
<p>（乙）關於各校者</p>
<p>（一）省立高級農科職校、以前因地勢狹小、學生實習頗感困難、故技術上難有把握、現在新校址業經覓定、塲地勉强敷用、正在進行遷建計畫中、似有改造可能、嗣後應於農林兩科之教導、特別注意地方生產之改良與增進、蠶科是否合於地方需要、湘南·湘西少數縣分蠶桑業之衰落、有無挽回希望、絲繭之品質與銷路、有無與長江下游各省並駕齊軀之可能、此諸問題、均爲該校應否繼續辦理蠶科之必要考慮、應由該校依據地方情形、决定設科條件、不必因仍原有科目、難獲發展、</p>
<p>（二）省立高級工科職校·機械·電工兩科、實習設備、均有相當基礎、如實習得法、則機械科畢業生可以負担普通機器工廠製造上之任務、電工科畢業生亦可充當通常電廠之管理人員惟本省工廠無多、學生須向外發展、故出路甚感困難、染織科一切設備、亦屬敷用、應化科於製紙·製革·製胰三項、雖均有試騐、然設備簡單、此兩科出品均缺乏生產上的價値、應照左列辦法改進、A按湘省現在職教情形、應以大學工學院爲養成高等技術人才之中心、以高工爲造成實際生產人才之塲合、故於工廠實習、在高工方面不宜泛而不精、致循環學習而無所擅長、應注意專門技能、以期實用、B機械可注意仿造（參閱前條）、以便推廣、如該校所製各種織機成績甚佳、價亦不昂、學校工廠均可採用、是其明效、其化學科應增之機械、即可由該校逐漸製作、以期完整、其餘普通工業（如印刷麵粉·壓模·製鐵·切片·漂染·製油等之不屬於精製及巨大、工業範圍內者）所用機械設計之圖式、亦應逐漸廣爲搜羅、以作學生研究之質料、C實習廠所如能擴充、可按照工廠制度從事於專爲生產製造之組織、如各校學生所用服裝、皮件·及淸潔衛生用品、均可大宗製造、不但可作爲地方生產事業之提倡、兼可爲學生經營生產事業樹一範型、D實習成品、應選擇數種、製成適於行銷之商品、其意匠、式樣·裝璜·及價格等、均應研究準備、如有把握、可呈由教育廳籌撥臨時經費或担保、向銀行貸欵、以資周轉、同時並可附設職業補習班、訓練工徒、</p>
<p>（三）私立修業高級農科職校於改良稻種試騐有年、於增加收獲量一節、已有成績、正在推廣、惟因此項事業、收效無多、現已改變途徑、由試騐農村副業入手、獲利較速、將來實效必宏、該校設於長沙城外依山傍水之區、塲地勉强敷用、職業科教員領導學生工作、頗爲認眞、學生實習、別爲分地及公耕兩種、大都短衣赤足、耕耘田間、堪以耐勞吃苦、訓練得法、但以該校經費及設置狀况論、當以專辦農科職業爲宜、其鄕村師範一科應設法逐漸結束、</p>
<p>（四）私立公輸高級土木科職校係由泥木工會所創辦、省會及鄰近各區工程地點、均可領導學生前往實習、畢業生亦不愁無出路、故於事業進展頗有把握、唯建築工程之消長、關於社會經濟之盈絀、據工會統計、長沙一市每年建築工程總値在二千萬元以上、近年趨勢、有進無退、但是否能保持此項常態、殊難斷定、最好聯絡鄰近各省工會、收容武漢·宜昌·九江·南昌·各處學生（以由工會保送者爲原則）以廣造就、則於人才消納、事業改良兩有裨益、</p>
<p>（五）私立華中美術學校師範、西畫兩科學生作品尙有可觀、唯設備簡單範圍狹小、木炭畫爲西法之基本練習、模型太少、心手眼之學習難期準確、寫生自不待言、若於水彩油畫中、務求顏色配角之悅目、則基礎未立、終屬虛而不實、此點應加注意、中畫作品較之西畫爲優、蓋天才較高之人、意境易於領悟、但得其形似、究不如由工筆花鳥人物入手、然後再習寫意、較爲切實、</p>
<p>（六）岳陽私立湖濱中學自改設農科以來、對於園藝一次、設置漸增、該校校舍寬廣、景物優美、且位於洞庭湖側肥沃之區、最適於辦理農科、惜經費支絀塲地不能擴充、進展不易、岳陽縣政府委託經營君山一案、如治安不成問題、不妨接受、倘學校財力不足、可與縣政府共同　約集本省各界及銀行領袖、合組委員會辦理、因君山爲產茶名區、亦爲風景勝地、經營得法、於地方裨益區淺、　　　　　　　　　　（完）</p>

<p>推行奴化教育</p>
<p>大同學校造成日僞縣參事官</p>
<p>近又設法律學校及皇族學校</p>
<p>各教科書內容充滿奴化性質</p>
<p>（東北社長春訊）日人在東北事事存操縱之野心對於教育尤厲行其文化侵略之毒計、所採教材、完全以奴化出之、擬令東北民衆、悉爲奴隸而後巳、茲將所探得之奴化教育情形誌於次、</p>
<p>（大同學院）僞國承日軍之命、在長春設立之大同學院、學員一百二十名、日人佔九直名、僞國學員三十名、專爲造就各縣參事官、僞國之三十名、亦均係曾留學日本受有日本教育薰陶者、此一百二十名學員、平日分派各縣調查民間生產狀况、及作僞「王道政治」之宣傳、各縣參事官到長春時、亦均集會於此、報告各縣情形、凡由日本國新派委之少壯急進派、則公然謂僞國爲傀儡、日本是主體、事事均須秉承日人辦理云云等咄咄逼人之詞、所以僞國方面之三十名學員中、多有不能忍耐而欲脫離者、若稍老成穩健一點之日參事官、則便以日滿提携共存共榮等類好聽之詞句、以麻醉人心、所以少壯急進派雖鋒芒畢露、盛氣凌人、而確足以激起仇視之心理、若老成穩健派雖有時令人如坐春風、但足以銷滅我民族性、於不知不覺之中、更爲可畏云、</p>
<p>（法律學校）僞滿洲國司法部秉承日方之命、近在長春南崗設立法律學校、以期養成傀儡司法人員、巳於八月二十一日發表官制、計如下校長一名、教授四名、助教授　七名、薦任事務官一名、薦任翻譯官二名、薦任囑官二名、委任囑官二名、并已內定僞司法部日人古田總務司長爲校長、</p>
<p>（皇族學校）僞國務院最近議决在長春瀋陽等處設「　皇族子弟學校」、先辦小學、而後再擴充至中學大學等校、并請傀儡溥儀爲「皇族子弟學校校長」此「校」僅限「皇族」子弟、方能入校、已於瀋陽小南門之維城學校舊址、設有「皇族」子弟學校籌備處、當有僞財政大臣熙洽助欵三萬元、爲籌備費、并由關內聘來教員十四人、分赴瀋陽長春擔任教授、并聞除此十四人爲漢人充教授外、其餘者均爲日人、</p>
<p>（奴化教材）僞奉天公署印刷局受僞廷特命、印刷僞文教部所編纂之小學教科書後、所有印刷將竣事、并於八月一日起、即將向全東北所有各小學校散佈奴化教材科目、其科目初級小學　則有修身教科書外國文算術自然日本語等、高級小學則教以孝經（節本）節本論語、國史教科書以及地理等科、聞奉天印刷局即將該項教科書分給販賣書舖、共同販賣云、三民主義教科書、從此將絕跡於東北四省矣、</p>

<p>中美兩國佔優勢</p>
<p>昨日單打日本及英國均全敗</p>
<p>今日雙打中英必有精彩劇戰</p>
<p>雙打兩場外並有中英兩單打</p>
<p>扶輪盃上海萬國網球賽、中華對英國、美國對日本、同時於昨日下午在上海網球會舉行複賽、雖烈日如火、觀者仍有三百餘人之多、單打四塲、中美均獲全勝、美國選手卡爾生與史規亞之表演、有異乎往日之美妙、使日本町田與須籐、不得不甘拜下風、中華鄭兆佳王文正、隨便打來、穩操勝券、英國史篤克與福勃斯、不堪一戰、望風披靡、今日下午爲四國之雙打比賽、但英國方面、因星期一不能抽空、故將最後單打兩組、提前於今日同時舉行、是以中英兩國間之决賽資格、定今日下午解决焉、茲將昨戰詳盡、分誌如下、</p>
<h3 id="c192">美國勝日本 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>卡爾生力挫町田　美國第一單打卡爾生對日本町田、於下午三時開始、二人表演俱佳、長抽攔網、均甚精彩、尤以卡爾生之技術、進步最多、觀乎日前以直落三挫王文正、良非偶然、而町田深入底綫之長抽、往往使卡爾生疲於奔命、應付不暇、但卡爾生善用上網、每奏奇效、町田大爲所困、以六比四、六比三、連負兩盤、第三盤町田極有得勝機會、曾以五比三局導前、五比四後、町田發球、以三比二分佔優、祇須再勝一球、即勝是盤、不意打一出界球、成四十（三比三）之等數後、反失是局、成五比五之局數、卡爾生即以六比五反居優先、町田再平等之、卡爾生卒連勝兩局、而造成直落三之結果、</p>
<p>六比四</p>
<p>卡爾生（美）｛六比三｝町田（日）</p>
<p>八比六</p>
<p>史規亞擊敗須籐　美國第二單打史規亞之球藝、亦遠非昔比、善用劈球、深入底綫、向兩角掃射、觸網及出界球甚少、且善奔跑、救球極有把握、其作戰也、或前或後、滿塲飛奔、日本之須籐、雖亦穩健耐戰之流、卒以工夫略差、而失敗焉、第一二兩盤、史規亞以六比三、六比一勝、甚爲容易、第三盤須籐曾以三比一及五比三佔先、史規亞奪得發球局、成五比四後、須籐發球、史竟連負四記、遂歸須籐以六比四勝是盤、第四盤中、史規亞恢復原狀、以六比二勝之甚易、</p>
<p>六比三</p>
<p>史規亞（美）｛六比一｝須籐（日）</p>
<p>四比六</p>
<p>六比二</p>
<h3 id="c193">中華勝英國 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>鄭兆佳勝史篤克　中英之賽、繼美日而起、本年中華不用老將林寶華邱飛海任單打、而以新進之鄭兆佳及王文正出塲、不論錦標得失、其辦法甚爲得當、可提高網球界之目光、知林邱之外、尙有鄭王等選手之可注意焉、鄭之對手爲史篤克、爲一面倒之形勢、開首鄭即連下四局、全不費力、但以後犯大意失誤之病、球常送入網內或出界外、予對手追成五比四、僅以六比四勝、第二盤六比一、對手太不景氣、鄭亦未見精彩、隨便應付而已、第三盤鄭又以六比三勝、鄭之戰略、頗見聰明、球路亦甚熟、惜發球雙失誤尙多、宜加注意、</p>
<p>六比四</p>
<p>鄭兆佳（中）｛六比一｝史篤克（英）</p>
<p>六比三</p>
<p>王文正挫福勃斯　英國之福勃斯、爲去年上海初級單打之决賽權者、穩健則有餘、攻人則不足、王文正牛刀小試、直落三固在意中、惟王之出手、甚爲客氣、隨便應付、六比三、六比二、寫寫意意、第三盤王以四比一領前、福勃斯曾追成五比四、以六比四終、觀王之技藝、並無進步、且球路無變化、遇實力相當之人、必致吃虧、實宜多用智力探討也、</p>
<p>六比三</p>
<p>王文正（中）｛六比二｝福勃斯（英）</p>
<p>六比四</p>
<h3 id="c194">今日甚吃重 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>雙打必大有精彩　今日秩序、除美日及中英之雙打外、尙有提前舉行之中英兩組雙打、故共有四塲比賽、其間尤以中華對英國之雙打比賽、最爲吃重、亦理想中上海從來未有之精彩比賽、並可預卜本年羅伯杯國際雙打錦標之誰屬、良以英國選手爲名將德孚與朋尼費區代表、而中華則由老將林寶華邱飛海二人出塲、均爲羅伯杯之代表、亦上海最佳之雙打組也、是以今日之戰、必可轟動一時、秩序如下、</p>
<p>卡爾生（美）對築　地（日）三時起雙打　史規亞　　　　鎌　田</p>
<p>邱飛海（中）對　德　孚（英）四時半雙打　林寶華　　　　　朋尼費區</p>
<p>單打　鄭兆佳（中）對福勃斯（英）五時半　　　王文正（中）對史篤克（英）五時半</p>

<h3 id="c203">誰在推銷化裝品？ <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 雲裳</p>
<p>在最近一月內的報紙上，已屢次登出外國化裝品輸入額數字之可驚。但仔細看來，今年上半年連花邊算在內，才値一百五十萬。我們如實際知道上海一地婦女的經濟地位與政治地位，實在不値得大驚小怪。</p>
<p>據最近報告，上海共有三百四十萬居民，女子佔一半有一百七十萬。除掉那些推糞車，賣小菜，住在曹家渡，楊樹浦，浦東，……一帶草棚子裏的窮苦農工婦女外，自十歲到五十歲的女人，無一不自動的購買化裝品。而那些舞女，明星，交際花，姨太太，各種各類的妓女，則每月所購更多於常人。假定每個月購買化裝品的女人佔全上海女人三分之一弱，－－五十萬人。則平均每人所購買的外國化裝源只五角錢而已。</p>
<p>可是我們一看那些舞女交際明星們所使用的化裝品費，一天正不止僅五角。因爲一天五角，一個月只十五塊錢，那離事實却是太遠。依我的估計，上海女人每人每月使用化裝品在一元以上的當有二十萬人，這是包括頭水，眉黛，胭脂，口脂，粉類，蔻丹，香水，肥皂，雪花膏，各種美容藥品，……等等在內的。如果屬實，則每月在這類女人身上已有約六百萬化裝費，而燙髪和使用器具及女僕工資等雜項尙不在內。</p>
<p>男子就不使用化裝品嗎？頭髪膏水一項，現在在都市中，男子顯然比女子使用得多。雪花膏香水在男子使用的也不少。這且不管他。</p>
<p>我們現在所當研究的，乃這每月平均購買五角錢的外國外裝品的五十萬上海婦女的動機和需要。其中最感需要化裝品的，當推那班「營妓女式生活」的女子。這類女子在上海地方的數目是可驚的，由大官闊人的姨太太，以至馬路上拉客的「野鷄」，中間要包括學校裏的皇后，機關中的花瓶，商店中做招牌的女店員，專事伴人跳舞的交際明星，……形形色色的女人在內。這一類的女人使用化裝品可算最多了。但他們之所以必須使用大量的化裝品，完全在維持她們的「業務」，一個一身汗臭的舞女或妓女之不會招男客－－－玩弄者－－－的歡迎，自屬一種絕對的事實。即如那些學校「皇后」的頭銜，也不是一個不施脂粉，不燙頭髪，不使用香水蔻丹，……而穿着布衣布履的女學生所能取得。况且這類的女人所使用的化裝品，其來源的一部分常係男子贈與，又爲確定的事實。</p>
<p>這樣，事態的眞相已經明瞭。大量化裝品之使用在特種女人身上，其作用等於火車頭行駛時所需的煤水，汽車所用的汽油一般。火車汽車之行駛雖日見舊損，而煤水汽油之銷耗，與牠本身的關係，却祗是供人驅策的動力罷了。妓女式的女人之於化裝品又何獨不然呢？</p>
<p>上海一地，除掉勞苦羣衆外，有的是失意的政客官僚，有的是闊人閒人，有的是小開遺少，……有了這班寶貝集中在上海，於是無數的妓女式的女人遂卜晝卜夜的裹在化妝品裏吃喝玩樂過着浪費生活的日子。</p>
<p>然則買化妝品和需用化妝品的倒底是誰呢？外國化妝品入口之多是不是那些使用大量化妝品之舞女妓女本身的罪過呢？我們還忍心責備她們嗎？</p>
<p>總之，國家組織破敗至於如此其極，大好國內市塲不爲自國工業所佔用，復無以抵禦異族經濟之侵略，而竟以化妝品之輸入責之可憐的妓女輩的女性，不亦寃乎？</p>

<h3 id="c204">蘇聯的妻子 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Anra　Louse　Strong著亮秋譯</p>
<p>（這是一個和蘇聯人結婚的美國女子的自述。從這中間可以看到蘇聯婦女對於兩性生活中的種種觀念。蘇聯在世界目光中是個謎的國家，這些觀念是値得我們注意的，爰特譯出，貢諸讀者。）</p>
<p>最近我在美國遊行演講，偶然在一個老朋友家裏吃飯，飯後我述說我已於兩年前在莫斯科結了婚。突然在座的人都好像很驚奇似的看着我，並且在她們的問話中，表示出她們對我們的婚姻是怎樣的懷疑和不了解。</p>
<p>在另一地方，一個女友探聽我，蘇聯人的所謂「個人生活」，歷數小時之久。我雖很忠實的回答了她，但我知道她仍不能明瞭。後來，在討論着人類某種優美的德性時，我說我的丈夫有着高度的這種德性。「我想你「喜歡」你的丈夫的。」她驚奇的說。這次，我眞的發惱了。「爲什麼我一定要和一個我所不喜歡的人同居？」我回答。但從她的談話中我奇怪着她爲什麼會和她的丈夫同居着。因爲她很直率的告訴我，她藐視她丈夫的某種特性－－近於無用的忠厚，這雖使他成爲一個悅意的伴侶，可是不利於資本主義下賺錢的目的。在她家裏會餐，這種毫無虛飾的苛刻的談話－－從她不滿意於一個無用的丈夫起，一直講到她遊蕩的，浪費的子女－－使人聽了會覺得非常不愉快的。什麼傳統勢力，什麼經濟的壓迫，使她一天天忍受這種不愉快的會餐？</p>
<p>假若蘇聯家庭中會餐時有這樣令人憎惡的談話，他們很簡捷的分離就完了。生命是這樣的短促，這樣的可寶貴，不値得消耗於不悅意的伴侶上。人有時在職業中因爲要得到訓練和事業的成功，必需忍受不悅意的伴侶。但家庭的宗旨不是爲訓練和事業，祇是消遣和休養生命的，爲什麼人類要忍受這種不悅意的伴侶呢？</p>
<p>我知道把家庭的宗旨這樣的說，在蘇聯的妻子們看來是很合理的，但在和二種古代婚姻觀念挑戰，一種是教會所主張的家庭觀念，另一種是封建資本主義下的家庭觀念。如培根主張的家室觀念，使許多母親忍受終身痛苦的兒女觀念，仰給於人的觀念等－－這些觀念在蘇聯的婚姻中像姻般地消失了。</p>
<p>在蘇聯的妻子們的目光中，婚姻不和宗教，法律，財產權發生關係的。這些東西對於我們的生命是毫不重要的。沒有人有很多的錢財，所以財產權是很簡單的。婚前所有的，婚後仍各有所有；婚後有的，則歸二人合有。夫婦二人所得的工資，合有而合用，其中極小部份積貯着預備將來的。宗教仍存在在需要牠的人們中間；在教堂結婚的事有時也有。法律也存在的；大部份，－－雖不是全部，－－的結婚都合理的登記了的，但沒有一個人會問他的朋友的結婚有否登記。</p>
<p>在我們，結婚的要素是持久的交誼，使生理的，精神的和情感的生活滿意而充實。到底持久到什麼時候，祗有未來的事實能說；我們雖希望牠能持久到終身，但也不能保證。對於結婚的人，幾乎每個結婚的人，結婚是從養育子女中相互的參與未來生活。沒有一個正常的人不希望有子女的。在我的蘇聯的相識中記不起有一個老處女。但結婚只是交誼的一種；而子女是未來生活中的唯一關鍵。個人「愛好」，在我們只是歌劇中的一支歌曲，牠的繁複的，嘈雜的弦音只占全劇中很有限的時間。</p>
<p>假使我們的結婚，牠是這樣的不正式。沒有拘束或强迫，很簡單的在官廳裏登記，有時竟不登記，在蘇聯國境外的人們看來不是「正當的婚姻，」那末我們也要說資本主義社會裏的婚姻，像我們在小說裏和新聞紙上見到的，不是可怕，便是可笑，在新聞紙上宣佈結婚，在我們看來是很奇怪的，假若像美國樣的把我們的結婚消息滿載在社會新聞欄內，而我們的照片顯現在許多白色的花朵中間，把我們的個人的情感這樣的誇耀張大，我們覺得很可羞恥的。我們把我們的結婚向幾個至友宣佈，往往在婚後而不在婚前。</p>
<p>我們也並非矯情，不願宣佈。假若我們得到科學的榮譽，或做了集合農塲中架車的選手，或得了工廠中的製造獎狀，這樣把我們的名字在報紙上發表，我們覺得値得驕傲的。若我們的相片能在五月節會中高揭竿頭，而我們的伙伴向全世界報告說我們是戰士，那使我們感到無上的榮幸的。因爲這些都是我們的公共的行爲，値得頌揚或褒貶的，結婚是我們的私人生活，個人的事情呀！</p>
<h3 id="c205">日本女學生理想中的典型女性 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 獨步</p>
<p>－－康健端置－－</p>
<p>－－賢母良妻－－</p>
<p>在日本，現在到處都可看見聽見「非常時」這句話，政府是非常時的政府，國策是非常時的國策，甚至友朋相晤，亦說一句現在是「非常時」。什麼是「非常時」呢？人們似乎亦不很淸楚了解。但時我們知道，所謂「非常時」，就是日本帝國主義用一切力量，併呑中國，奪取太平洋霸權。爲了要實現這個目的，所以籠統的用「非常時」這句話，以誘惑日本的國民，在國內鼓吹絕對的愛國思想，侵略主義，英雄崇拜，尙武精神，以及普遍的製造戰爭心理，使浸淫於這毒素中的日本國民，狂熱的擁護日本對中國的侵略，對蘇聯的仇恨，對美國的爭霸政策。因此，戰爭的「氣分」籠罩着整個的日本。</p>
<p>在這時代，一般的日本女性，究竟是怎麼樣呢？在這「非常時」空氣下有怎麼一種理想呢？這倒是一個値得注意的問題。最近日本文部省或許爲了要測騐他們所培養的毒素，浸淫在日本國民，尤其是女性方面程度吧？曾經對於東京及地方的女性徵求對於「近代理想女性的要素是什麼？」之回答。根據他們所發表之統計，日本女性所希望的理想女性的要素，有以下的幾種：</p>
<p>甲，就東京市內十四個學校最高級女生一三六零人之統計結果：</p>
<p>（一）健康。（二）像女性的。（三）開朗。（四）有深邃的趣味。（五）意志堅强。（六）有貞操觀念。（七）家庭的。（八）了解社會情形。（九）有常識。</p>
<p>乙，就地方上三十一個學校最高級女生三二六一人之統計結果：</p>
<p>（一）健康。（二）開朗。（三）有經濟的觀念。（四）像女性的。（五）容姿端麗。（六）有貞操觀念。（七）有常識。（八）有教養的。（九）有深邃的趣味。（十）意志堅强。</p>
<p>就中健康一點，是地方與東京共同所佔的最多數。東京爲百分之六十九，地方爲百分之六十四，都有半數以上認爲是近代理想女性的要素。</p>
<p>從這統計來看，到底女性還是表現出女姓的特質的。首先，我們在這裏看不出什麼「非常時」的狂囂，蠻暴，她們依舊是很平和的，似乎沒有受到「非常時」的影響。戰爭「氣分」英雄崇拜，這種色彩，還是沒有的。她們很老實的希求着健康，健康第一，似乎是現在日本女性所想像的理想的要素。第二，就是日本賢母良妻主義的教育，仍舊是根深蒂固的。女子是家庭的，像女性的，有貞操觀念的，總結一句，是一個家庭的人，而不是像男子一樣的參加社會活動。創造新歷史的女性，震動世界的解放女性的新女性生活，在她們腦裏似乎還未形成一個觀念。第三，她們的希望，還是一個良善的主婦，服侍丈夫的所謂良妻，所謂賢母的憧憬者，是馴伏的弱者，是柔优的服從者。因此，她們仍舊跳不出「非常時」的犧牲的範圍，因爲她們還不是以新理想之追求爲理想女性的典型。不過這僅是一部分的女學生的見解而已，此外活躍着的女性，當亦不在少數。</p>
<h3 id="c206">美國女學生畢業後的出路問題 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 耿龍根</p>
<p>大部份的美國女學生，都是很愛玩的，她們對於世界上的一切，素來沒有什麼認識；她們所喜歡的，就是每日與她們所喜愛的男人跳舞，遊玩，過作沒有規則的生活·但是她們畢業了以後，因爲經濟的需要，不得不去找職業，有的因爲她們的父親或親戚朋友是公司銀行或政府機關裏的重要職員，她們就能得到職業；有的却沒有這種機會，不過她們還可以到學校裏的職業介紹部Pacement　bureau去請求他們帮助，以下是美國東部一個女子高等學校的職業介紹部所標出可代介紹的幾種工作：</p>
<p>一，直接的社會工作。二，醫院，大學，製造廠，政府機關等實騐室的助理工作。三，銀行，保險行，政府機關等統計工作。四，報館，書店的助理編輯工作。五，商業與教育機關的事務員工作。六，大百貨公司中各種工作，七，需要或不需要速記與打字的書記工作，　以上所標出的幾項工作，當然沒有女子高等學校的畢業生所願做的，不過舍此又無別法，但在這些工作裏面，尙有她們所不能做的：於是聰明的學校當局，特在畢業後的假期裏，設一數星期完成的補習班；這樣一方面教以打字速記而統計等技能；另一方面對於職業介紹部有限的位置，限制給於成績較優的學生，而有一公平的分配。</p>
<p>但那些不能爲職業介紹所介紹的畢業生呢？她們除了偶然得到好運外，她們只能替無綫電機公司，保險行，化妝品工廠，汽車公司等到外面去兜攬生意，她們預先必須付予公司一種保證；兜到生意時，她們可以得到一點佣金，如果兜攬不到生意時，那非但不能得到佣金，甚至公司方面還要與她們解職。</p>
<p>有的，去做富人家孩子的保姆，或無綫電臺的報告員等，還有的，那眞苦了－她們竟到百貨公司裏去做Dearie的工作，Dearie就是沒有受過教育的女子，因爲她們的面目尙美，態度帶點風騷，無論稱呼何人都用Dearie（親愛的）一字，百貨公司的主人僱用她們來吸引一般下流的顧客的。</p>
<p>當然，做教員是女子較佳的職業，但是以前的畢業生巳侵去了大部份的位置，並且新畢業的必較教過書的缺少經騐，所以新畢業的很少會被聘去教書的，　因此現在美國女學生的家長們，大都勸他們的女兒們去學習醫學，藥學，法律，商業，與圖書館管理等科，因爲這些可使他們的女兒們在畢業以後，比較容易得到出路，</p>

<p>— 冰筠</p>
<p>當她接到唯一底妹妹的噩耗時，她底心靈幾乎粉碎了。她好似觸了電，兩手捧着信，臉色非常慘白，如木鷄似地呆立在朝南底窗前。信慢慢地從她手裏掉了下來。她雙膝一軟，不覺跪了下去。她的左手按着凸凸地跳躍着底心，举着右手，正好似在禮拜堂禱告的牧師一般。母親發痴一般在地下打滾；隣舍都跑到她們房裏來。一個鳥巢似的房子，擠得水洩不通，你一句，我一句在勸慰她，可是他們的淺薄的安慰，適足以增加她底哀傷。她越哭越傷心，越哭越厲害，她不斷地推胸跥足，她想起她一家悲慘的命運，飄零的身世，只覺得有如萬箭穿心，肝腸寸斷！</p>
<p>她回想自己遭了那一段殘酷的舊恨，身心都成了殘廢，一拐一拐地回到母家。雖是母女至情，但財力單薄的母親，竟想用淚水拒絕，病女的歸來。幸而年少的妹妹，俠義而勇敢，挺身担當弱姊的終身。她說：媽！苦了這兩年罷！我高中畢業了自有辦法。她日間上學校，夜間給人抄寫至夜深，算日子一天一天挨了過去，期待的時間一天一天近來，豈料………</p>
<p>老母已經六十開外，她的餘年還不知該交給誰人；而自己在家已是出嫁之人，在外又是被棄之身，還能有甚麼着落？而况帶了這惡醜的病魔，就是仁人君子，也當退避三舍。</p>
<p>她想天地生人，不知到底是呌他「活」還是呌他「死」來？好好的她會弄到這半死不活的地步：好好的妹妹十七八歲人就想負起一家三口的生計。然而妹妹平日那麼用功，現在竟會弄到畢業會考不及格，而斬斷了她的生機，斬斷她所負担的全家的生機，於是而苦痛趕她入於死路！</p>
<p>死路！死路爲甚麼死人走了不彀，單要呌有用的活人走？妹妹是十分有用的，雖然她會考不及格。倘然自己早死了呢，妹妹也許因負担輕些，不至如此如刺在背，而急急於自殺。她想自己這活屍，連累了好人！</p>
<p>她迷迷糊糊想了多時，暗黑的房裏除了母親低微的氣息以外沒有別人。她默默地舉起一杯藥水送到唇邊，喃喃地唸着：</p>
<p>「一棺付身，萬事都已；</p>
<p>人生到此，天道何論？」</p>
<h3 id="c208">談談「賢母良妻」制 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 芸綺</p>
<p>在『婦女們！回到家庭裏去！』的呼聲下，賢母良妻制，又復爲一般人所讚頌了。「賢母良妻」，古今來對此問題解釋的意見很不一致。大槪一般人之所謂賢母者，卽絕對服從丈夫的意志，負擔家庭一切瑣務，任勞任怨，至死不辭之謂也。所謂良妻者，卽對兒女專門盡生養教育之責是也。這樣的賢母良妻，從歷史發展的階級段說來，卽從中世紀的封建社會說來，固然有牠自己的作用或意義。然而實際上，這種制度始終只是一種片面的義務或道德，一種爲男子利用來拘縛女子，使女子成爲家庭奴隸之最狡滑的手段。恰同『貞操』一樣，不過爲男子利用以實行約束婦女爲其片面的性慾工具而已。凡是片面的義務或道德，都是壓迫人的工具，銬梏人的枷鎖。</p>
<p>各國自資本主義發展以來，無數農村及城市的婦女被迫離開家庭，走入了工廠及各種社會機關（商店，學校！等）之中，於是中世紀的家庭費度被破壞了，並且女子也或多或少地獲得部份的經濟獨立權，已不復能忍受從男子方面來的片面束縛和壓迫。於是便發生了要求婦女解放的婦女運動。而婦女運動之最初步的目標，便是打破舊式的家庭制，將婦女大衆從家庭奴隸之下解放出來。反對中古家庭的一切片面的義務，道德和禮教等鎖鍊。要求在經濟，政治和文化各方面與男子享受同等的權利。由此，我們便十分明白：凡是主張恢復賢母良妻制的人，實際就是主張恢復中古封建時代的家庭制及其附帶之一切壓迫婦女的工具。換句話說，就是重新將婦女從長期奮鬬中已經獲得的某些成果（如婚姻自由權，遺產權，選舉權……）統統交給男子，强迫她們回到家庭中去重作家庭的奴隸，性慾的工具罷了。</p>
<p>然而事實上，果能恢復賢母良妻制嗎？比方單從中國來說，無數萬的農民已經破產，農民家庭已從根破壞，不是丈夫出外作工，當兵（甚至爲匪），就是妻子出外作女工或當娘姨，在這種情形下，整個家庭弄得妻離子散，那裏還談得上甚麼賢母良妻呢。純粹的工人家庭，在資本家嚴酷剝削與壓迫之下，在長期的不斷的失業威脅之下，更是悲慘萬分，對他們說什麼賢母良妻，那只是夢囈！其實現在人們所倡導的『賢母良妻』制，至多只能在那些小布爾喬亞的階層中發生些影響而已。</p>
<p>雖然賢母良妻制是違反客觀事實，不能發生多大的影響，然而我們對這種復古的運動不能不予以批評，不能不起而抗議。我們應該告訴那些開歷史倒車的人們：同歷史作對是不可能的，歷史始終是要向前進的，同歷史作對，結果必然要被歷史的車輪所輾碎。現代的婦女决不會再受那種愚民政策了。</p>

<p>帶着一顆駱駝背着重負般的沉甸甸的心，在柏油馬路的人行道上走着，大都市的街市在白晝也是那麼喧囂，只少了一些燈光，在燈光下是使萬物美化了的，卽使是魔鬼的罪惡也不會如白天那麼猙獰。</p>
<p>走進XX坊，我穿過舖滿着煤屑的小徑，在西瓜皮與垃圾堆的對過，我去取修好了的自來水筆。</p>
<p>「是……小瑜呀！」</p>
<p>一個沙啞的喉嚨喊着我，心跳了，到了上海快半個月，我像是到了沙漠裏，遠遠得連半個熟人影子也碰不到。</p>
<p>剛一抬頭：一對似曾相識的灰黃的眸子啊！緊接着這失掉了靑春的火氣的姑娘的後面，散出來了串提盒子挽小籃的女工們，再一看面前的姑娘，也是一隻鐵罐子。</p>
<p>「阿球喲！」大槪我的眼睛是濕的，快樂塞得我透不了氣了，瞧一瞧阿球，至少是像改畫稿似的，比五年前勾去了一圈。瘦稜了。</p>
<p>她扶着我的肩：</p>
<p>「小瑜你好？怎麼地，也到了上海？」只有那雙灰黃的眸子沒改變什麼，平時也許要少點光彩，不過這幾分鐘內，它們是興奮底。</p>
<p>「有事喲，馬上要回家的。」我撒了謊，爲什麼要使一個人失望呢，她是大姊姊般勸過我離開學校的，生活教養得她比什麼都順利，她在艱苦中掙扎，一個人浮萍似的南南北北，我對她只有慚恧與低頭。不忘記的是她在北國與我撒手時的話：</p>
<p>「還想躲起來唸死書嗎，還想用紙糊的金衣貼在肉身上？趁早摜了書包投到眞實的生活裏去，」記得淸楚的，她還狠狠地在我臂上擰了一把。</p>
<p>「眞是，你忘了我，我忘了你似的！」</p>
<p>「畢業了嗎？再糊一套什麼裝！」</p>
<p>這張刻薄的嘴是永遠改不了的！我涎了笑臉搖頭：</p>
<p>「別提吧，你的事比我有意思。」她的環境使她只唸到小學，她不懊喪，繼了她哥哥們的路，終於隨着一個老鄕親來到上海。去了之後只來過一個短條：</p>
<p>「眞的生活比金鋼石都寶貴，在這裏，人們是覺悟到爲集團作工的意義，我勞働，我在熾燃的熔爐裏陶冶，我熔在流體裏，流體裏摻合了我，這一團火要凈化宇宙。」</p>
<p>簡直是一個摸不到要領的條子呵，我奇怪地思索着阿球有這毅力的原因，許就是困苦的爭鬥的賜予吧！</p>
<p>「你當管車？」我瞧見這是個XX紗廠。</p>
<p>她點點頭：「除了爲飯粒必需流去的血汗外，這裏有使你感到生活緊張的快活，苦是吃得很够，不過，哦－－誰也不準備作一輩子活奴才的！我們是像新的寬緊帶一樣地繃繃地結在一塊！」沙嗓子變得沉着而輕微，可是像水門汀一樣的膠住在我的心葉上。</p>
<p>伴我去拿了筆，在廠門口分了手。我受到不少嘲笑，然而這嘲笑只使我感到眞摯。</p>
<p>「懦怯的人！」歸途中我這麼駡着自己。心是燃了火似的。</p>

<p>— 沈敏行</p>
<p>小朋友之中，一定有人見了題目要問：「到底什麼是常識？」</p>
<p>不錯現在我可以告訴你，常識是一種通常的智識，它的範圍非常廣泛，是我們人類用以解决日常生活中一切普通的事物和問題，創造一種健全的生活的。</p>
<p>許多人說：「人是理智的種物」可見人與智識是不能分開的人生中各事，都靠智識而成就的，智識不豐富的人，無論做什麼事，十九會失敗。</p>
<p>常識是智識的全部，所不同的，不過「博而不精」罷了，所以一個人缺少常識，生活一定也不會完美。</p>
<p>小朋友們，你們想做個健全完美的人嗎？那就不可缺乏常識。無論在什麼地方，什麼時候，遇到什麼事情，只要有常識存在，都要用銳利的眼光去認識各種新事物，創造許多新事業，那是多們可喜的事呀！</p>
<p>在小朋友中間，常識當不愧是創造健全生活的最好的工具，而也是一種最豐滿的精神上的食糧！</p>

<p>— 寒玉</p>
<p>興登堡將軍不幸地死了。</p>
<p>他是德國的總統，也是德國的名將。他能把侵略他國家的敵人，趕到國外去，又能守住著自己的土地，永遠不失掉。</p>
<p>民國三年（西歷一九一四年）的時候，歐洲起了一個大戰。一方是德奧諸國，一方是英法俄等國。俄國已侵略了德國的幾省。那時德國有一個將軍，能把俄軍驅到德國境外去。這就是興登堡將軍。</p>
<p>歐洲大戰的末期，世界各國，都去攻打德國。當然，德國雖是强盛，終不能對付世界各國的。所以德國是節節失敗了。但是有一個將軍，守住著他的戰壘，到停戰爲止，各國始終不能够攻破他。這也就是興登堡將軍。</p>
<p>興登堡將軍有愛國的熱心，堅强的意志，偉大的魄力。他是德國的民族英雄。我們應該紀念他，效法他，使中國也有興登堡式的人物發現，來驅走我們的敵人！</p>

<p>— 錚</p>
<p>聰明的小朋友們！你們夜夜在電燈下讀書寫字，多麼的便利，你們就應該知道什麼呌做電燈？電燈是怎麼會發光的？</p>
<p>電燈的燈泡裏面是沒有一些空氣。怎麼會沒有呢？是用一種專門抽掉空氣的機器來抽掉的，所以有人呌做眞空。</p>
<p>燈泡裏面的上部，有一塊厚厚的玻璃玻璃裏面有兩根較粗的絲，這兩根絲，呌做白金絲。在燈泡的下部，有一根很長的炭絲，像波浪起伏似的環掛在中間的一根玻璃柱上。這炭絲是和白金絲接連的。</p>
<p>電流從白金絲到炭絲上經過的時候，便發生極大的阻力。有了阻力，因此就發出光來。假使用銖絲代炭絲，發光更强，因爲銖絲的阻力比炭絲更大。</p>
<p>電流的性質，非常危險，身體上碰到電流，便要觸電而死。</p>
<p>所以請小朋友們格外注意：電燈的開關和撲落等，都很可怕，切不可玩弄的。</p>

<p>可巧這天同學祥兒來呌他一同去租看圖書的小書看，文兒便想設立一個小小圖書館。祥兒聽了也很贊成，於是分頭去呌弄堂裏的孩子和近些的同學們參加，參加的條件是：將一切所有的書都寫上名字交來，等到閉館時發還；利益是：每天隨時可以到文兒家來看書。</p>
<p>這天小小圖書舘開幕了，文兒將會員所交來的書，讀過的，看過的，小朋友，兒童世界………，都排列起來，並且編了號碼，寫了一張目錄貼在牆上。大家都推舉文兒做會長，祥兒做副會長。於是從這天起看書的人很多，他看你的書，你看人家的書。又有許多孩子都經了會員介紹，拿了書來加入，館務一天比一天熱鬧，又認識了許多新朋友，又乘這暑假得了許多新智識。有不懂的便問文兒，文兒不懂便問大衆，有知道的便宣佈出來。</p>

<p>牛先生在田裏工作完畢，帶着一身的泥水，拖了笨重的脚步，慢慢地走回來，看見它的鄰居猪太太却逍遙自在的躺在那裏，還親愛地喂那小猪；牛先生心中很有些不平，它想：我同它完全一樣，爲什麼我要天天這麼辛苦地做工呢？早晨出門，晚上回來，把力氣換汗點，把力氣換泥水，它却只管吃，睡，長得這麼肥胖。於是牛先生放聲駡道：</p>
<p>「只吃不做的蠢貨！」</p>
<p>猪太太覺得人家在駡它，便直跳起來答道：</p>
<p>「你呢？」</p>
<p>「我們世世代代的子孫都要做了才吃，不做的沒得吃；大家自己出力耕種，然後有得吃，决沒有坐食的道理。」牛先生嚴聲厲色的說着。</p>
<p>「你才蠢咧，我們主人一天送食二次，我們從來不做工而有得吃，這種生活多快樂？你們做工，冬天吃寒風，夏天曬太陽，吃的還是和我們一樣，這不是自討苦吃嗎？」猪太太講得得意洋洋。</p>
<p>牛先生和猪太太爭吵了一塲，仍舊沒有結果，牛先生只覺得自己太勞苦了。</p>
<p>後來，新年到了，主人因爲設筵請客要用猪肉，便把猪太太殺了。牛先生却在新年裏很舒服的休息了十幾天。</p>

<p>那鮮紅色的石榴花已凋謝了。却留着一個一個的果實，掛在樹枝中間。在這棵石榴樹下有一堆草，草中常有螞蟻走來走去。</p>
<p>有一天，有一條蜈蚣在那裏休息着。那些螞蟻正忙碌地在尋食，有一個小螞蟻恰好經過這裏，忽然看見有這樣大的食糧，心中好生歡喜，就回洞去報告。</p>
<p>一會兒，許多螞蟻排着隊伍，直向蜈蚣那裏走來，不一會，正要預備搬着蜈蚣走的时候，蜈蚣却醒轉來了，它大怒之下，用盡了生平的氣力，應付螞蟻，不久把它們打得不成隊伍。後來因爲螞蟻越來越多，才把它咬死了，大家嘻嘻哈哈地把蜈蚣抬回洞去了。</p>
<p>我感覺到那些螞蟻因爲有團結的力量，所以能把强敵咬死。我們中國人民也要學螞蟻一樣，有團結的力量，共同對付敵人，那麼我們可以不受他們的欺侮了！</p>

<p>— 上海錢業小學校五年級裘怡庭</p>
<p>在夏季裏，我們往往看見狗要伸着舌頭，這是什麼緣故？請諸位小朋友想想看！</p>
<p>大凡一件事，都很可以研究的：我們小朋友尤要有研究的興趣，像英國發明家瓦特，小的時候，看見壺蓋掀動，他以爲壺中有一白髪老人，要跳出來，後來他仔細研究，發明水蒸汽之力很大，就發明蒸汽機關了，現在輪船火車等，都是從瓦特發明而得的。</p>
<p>夏日，狗伸舌頭，也有研究的價値啊。我知道狗的生理，它的舌上，有許多汗孔，汗都從汗孔裏流出來，所以要伸舌頭。因爲它全身生毛，汗從皮膚流出來，不是毛要黏濕了嗎？所以只得從舌上流下汗來了。譬如人們皮膚上，也有許多汗孔，汗都在皮膚上流出來的，所以夏日皮膚上就有許多汗啊。</p>

<p>暑假中，志方除了每天溫習舊書，以免荒廢學業外，父親又替他規定了一課「星期科學談話」，每星期日早晨由他的哥哥講授。</p>
<p>星期日那天，他哥哥拿了一隻熱水瓶說道：</p>
<p>「傳熱的方法有三種，一種是「傳導」，還有二種是「對流」和「輻射」。我們揑了鐵絲的一端，把另一端放在火裏燒，我們的手漸漸地覺得的熱，這就是由「傳導」傳來的熱。杯子裏放滿了水，在杯底用火燒，只見小的水泡泛上泛下的掀動着（水中加些茶葉，則更加顯明），不一會，杯口的水也熱了，這是因爲「對流」而傳來的。在太陽下或火爐旁，我們覺得熱，就是因爲「輻射」把太陽的熱或火爐的熱送上我們的身體來。」</p>
<p>「熱水瓶的內部，」說着他哥哥指了手中的熱水瓶，「是由兩層玻璃製成的，玻璃和玻璃當中，沒有空氣並且塗了一層有光澤的物質，這樣的裝置是可以使「傳導」，「對流」，「輻射」三種傳熱的方法都不能存在，所以裏面放了熱的東西，熱氣不會傳散出去，放了冷的東西，外界的熱氣不能跑進去使它溶化，因此，熱水瓶便能保熱藏冷，至於那外面裹着的鐵皮殼子，不過是用來保護裏面的玻璃心子罷了。」</p>

<p>在夏天，小朋友們不是常常想躱避洗浴嗎？有些小朋友或許要疑問：爲什麼人類要洗浴的，動物却沒有的呢？</p>
<p>我告訴你吧！動物也喜歡洗浴的。你不看見關在籠子裏的鳥，它常常把頭浸到水裏去，一會兒再伸出來。這便是它的洗浴。就是貓，它有時把脚爪向臉上撫摸幾下，狗也喜歡把後足舉起來，除去身上的汚穢。再講馬和驢，它每在疲倦的時候，在地上滾了幾滾，以表示要使筋骨的疲勞去掉，好似人類在洗浴的時候，把手巾在身上摩擦一下，想去掉疲倦一樣。</p>
<p>再說到猪，是再髒沒有了。但是他喜歡淸潔的，它常常在水塘裏盹着翻動身體，好似再舒服沒有了。至於最明顯的動物；像水牛，更是和水做朋友似的。</p>
<p>小朋友！你愛洗浴嗎？也許你羨慕動物般的整日不洗浴，多麼逍遙呀！但是你讀了上面一段話後，你覺得怎樣。不要再貪着玩耍了，去淸潔你的身體吧！</p>

<p>蝦蟆和靑蛙，將田田蓮葉，當着搖籃兒，自由自在地坐在其中。高興起來，還擊着小小的膜鼓，吵得滿塘響起來。</p>

<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>問：「很重的輪船，爲什麼能浮在水面，不會沉下去呢？」答：「我們請看吃剩罐頭食品的洋鐵罐頭，投在水中，是不是浮在水面？」這幾句問答是英國的鐵店小主人威爾遜與其朋友所談的。威爾遜說：「鐵造的船能够浮在水面，」那友人說：「何以把鐵片放在水中，就要沉下去呢？」威爾遜是鐵店出身的，他以從前的船，都是木造的，特用鐵的輕板試造一船，長二十米突，幅一，五米突，後來這船，竟用了七十年，自從威爾遜創造鐵船，能浮於水面，繼而模仿者日多，一八二0年，孟皮用八十馬力的蒸汽機關，又造了長四十米突，幅六米突的鐵船，如此以後，認明鐵船比木船堅固，而且不會沉下的。然而浮於水面的理由，突竟爲什麼呢？我用浮力來說明一下，譬如用一斤重的石塊，投入水中，石塊的分量，就爲水的推除，减少一斤重的量，若把石塊投入一部分，其投入部分，也是爲水的推壓减少其同量的重，這個原理，是英國人亞爾克美台士所發明，就是所謂浮力的作用，因爲石塊投入水中，這石塊，不論上下左右，都受推壓的力，左右的推壓力相同，上下的壓力，是有輕重，即從下面所受的推上力，與這石塊推除水的重量爲强，所以無論何物，能够浮在水面，都因這浮力的作用，因爲其物的重量，比同體積的重量爲輕時，那重量就比浮力爲小，當然浮起，輪船軍艦的排水量，比輪船軍艦爲輕時，自然不會沉下，換句話來說，輪船全體的體積重量，（裝載貨客以及其他一切）與這輪船相同體積水的重量，比較起來，因爲輪船輕，所以浮的，所以無論幾千萬噸的輪船，建造時先算出船的推除水的體積多少，才可决定有多少重量可以積載吧。</p>

<h3 id="c243">談秩序與人生 <a href="#c243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— 安天</p>
<p>秩序是什麼？在未曾談到本題以前，我們先得下一個簡約的定義。所謂秩序，就是有層次，不紊亂，換句話說，就是我們有生命的人類，當處理他們日常的生活時，需要一個完善的定則，而不使牠有顚倒或失當之謂。由此可見，秩序對於人生－－不論對於任何階級中人的人生，都是有相當的關係的。</p>
<p>在我們起初看來，秩序只是平凡而又平凡的兩個字，到處可以看見，同時也到處可以聽到，牠正同吃飯談話一樣的平凡，然而我們却决不可以因爲平凡而不去注意牠。我相信：你倘若拋棄了這種錯誤的成見，而把牠看作像一件新發明的東西一樣，用一番功夫去研究一下，牠將會給你以極大的利益；就是最少的條件，也可以使你感覺到做事順當，和時間的經濟。假如你是一個曾經注意過秩序的人，那末對於這些一定知道得很熟悉，而覺得我所說的非虛了。</p>
<p>在過去，能够把秩序兩字明瞭得最透澈的人，恐怕要算是囂俄了。他對於秩序曾經說過一叚很好的話，他說：「他在早上起來，就計劃一個處理一天的方法，而後順着這秩序做去；這樣，那人的手中便好像揑着一根導綫。因爲只有照着這根綫，牠可以引你走出這萬忙的迷宮。人，倘能把時間支配得秩序井然，那末，其人在各項事業中，就都有一綫光明；倘若做事之先沒有計劃好秩序，那不過是浪費了時光在瞎碰罷了。這樣，勢必萬難旁生，頭緒紛繁，旣難於支配，更是難以檢閱了。」麥古雷也說：「無方法，無論什麼良好的事業終難以成功。」韋勃斯透編輯他的字典時，前後共費了三十六年，但他後來對人說：「我的有方法，有秩序，却足足節省了我一二十年的光陰，又免去了許多憂心和勞苦。」照上面好幾位名人的話看來，做事有秩序實是一件有益的事情</p>
<p>實在的，這有秩序的好處並不限於名人；對於我們正有同樣偉大的利益。我們在這裏可以隨便舉兩個例來說。譬如一個大公司裏職員，遇到顧客一多的時候，要是你不順着秩序做去，到了最後，也許多給了貨物，也許少收了貨價。你想！那時怎樣的感到煩惱！又如一個主婦，假如要有一個整潔可愛的家庭，更非有秩序不可，若不是這樣的話，萬一有個客人來了，她先忙着抹桌掃地，等到客人將去了，她才打發人去泡茶買烟，這種「客來掃地客去煮茶」的無秩序態度，又將如何使人感到家庭的紊亂和主婦的低能呀！然而我們試一反這種無秩序的態度，那又將如何的感到舒適呢！</p>
<p>講到這種有秩序態度的養成，自然不是一朝一夕可以學得成的，須要在日常生活之中加以訓練，又須運用腦筋，明晰事情的重要和不重要，然後再定做事的先後。如是迭加訓練，等到一成習慣，也就無所謂困難了。</p>
<p>總而言之，秩序這兩字雖是覺得太平凡些，然而你苟能運用得宜，那非但能使你减少時間上的浪費，做事不適當的麻煩，和增加做事的效力，而且在外面看來，還會受到他人讚揚你辦事的有條不紊，做人的能幹有爲，而受到他人的尊敬，同時你事業的進步以及成功，也許會得益在這平凡的「秩序」兩個字上。</p>

<p>— 開河宜興縣王里</p>
<p>宜興足有三個多月不下雨了。太陽火球般地在空中烘炙，炎烈的熱度，把地層深處的水分都蒸發上去。地上的野草枯焦得祗剩下一點兒粗根；天空常有一陣陣的紅蜻蜓，紛紛地亂飛。『紅蜻蜓，陣陣飛；像紅雲，乾－－旱－－殺人！』小孩子們用竹枝拍着唱着。</p>
<p>街上的行人異常的稀少，祗有那『樂也』茶店的對面堆着一團赤膊的羣衆，仰頭踮脚地看着貼在壁上的黃紙黑字的佈告。有的人很正經地把它一字一字地讀出來：</p>
<p>『茲定於本月十三日（卽陰歷六月初二日）起開浚屋河上千五時前敲鑼爲號各工人一律携帶鋤頭鐵鍬等工具至鄕公所領取工作證爲要此佈</p>
<p>宜興　湯莊鄕　雪橋　鄕公所啟』</p>
<p>繞着湯鎭的屋河－－這是鄕間一條最寬大的河流，也是擔負着交通與灌漑兩重使命的主河，上流有七十二條山澗的水量會合到這裏來宣洩，下流注入宜興有名的『西氿』，轉匯太湖。在平時的旱象下是不容易乾的。反之，黃梅天落了四五寸的陣頭雨，一時排泄不了，就會泛濫起來，把草茅棚都冲掉的。現在，六七十年來最高度的乾旱下，這河的有些地方，已開龜紋般的坼縫，人們都在河床裏走來走去。有幾處還汪着水的地方呢，也好像癆病人喉嚨裏的老痰，淅漓淅漓地流動着，告訴人家這流動是不久的了。</p>
<p>從那個黃紙告示貼出以後，鎭上靜悶的空氣裏，這兩天便泛雜着喧嘈的呼聲。</p>
<p>『開河了！開河了！』無知的小孩們當歌謠般高興地唱着。</p>
<p>一般的老太婆表示着一種悲怨的語調：人家飯也沒有吃的了，還開什麼河！縣裏發下這許多開河費，也可以拿來救救我們苦人。雨，祗要誠心到『猛將廟』裏去求求，多燒點兒香也够了，菩薩有靈，雨總會下的。</p>
<p>老農夫們皺着深沉的愁眉，在那裏只管歎氣。他們對這過舊的生活，似感到一種不死不活的厭膩，對這未來的新生的憧憬，也沒有勇氣再去作較明確的想像。有時，倒反想到『人心這般刁滑，弄到年來不是乾天，就是水災。天要滅人，人怎麼救得了？』這些上面去。</p>
<p>眼看着枯死的田禾，心裏好像油鍋似的煎滾，都急得走頭無路。一般平時靠做短工，忙工生活的，有力氣也沒有地方可以出賣了，祇好捧着餓空的肚皮，軟軟地躺在床上。卽使甕裏藏着一點蠶吃剩的小麥（蠶塲時把靑小麥作很低的價錢，去押了桑葉來給蠶吃；後來，蠶沒養到，或者養到了而賣不起價，所以也有小麥全給蠶吃掉的。）但這樣的乾下去，生活也就成爲問題。有的急得沒法，結果，闔家都自盡了的慘劇也在開始演出了。</p>
<p>十三日早晨，鏜鏜鏜的緊急的鑼聲，催着一羣羣的農民，到鄕公所前面去了，他們擠在一塊空塲上，期待着工作的支配，都伸着頭頸，望着鄕公所關着的大門。</p>
<p>門呀地開了，他們又擁到前面去一點。特別引起他們注意的，是白竹布條的工作證和掛在壁上指示着五點半的自鳴鐘，因爲恐怕過了鐘點會領不到工作證的。</p>
<p>噹……噹，正打着六點鐘了：塲上還剩着許多的農民。</p>
<p>『沒有領到工作證的，明天早些來吧！』鄕長根據了他們訂的規則－－</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>一百五十人爲滿，六點鐘上工－－報告着進去了。</p>
<p>那些被擠在工作圈外的人們，在晨曦的閃動裏沸起一陣喧嚷，可是，有誰理會呢？一會兒也就只能懊喪地散了。</p>
<p>一條寬長的河底裏，巳劃好了白色的石灰綫，分着一塊塊的方數。他們脫下了衣服，挨次地找着自己的位置；一人拿了鋤頭畚箕挖土，一人搬運挖好的泥土，傾在河岸兩旁。在淸凉的早晨，工作都十分起勁。不久，濕落落的泥土巳堆滿在河的兩岸了。</p>
<p>太陽的熱流直壓在地面上，低凹的河漕裏裝滿了一百五十多個赤裸裸的，紫銅皮色的農民，一個個彎着腰，咬着牙齦，挖着被水壓得堅實的泥塊。那明珠似的汗水，急促的呼吸，漸漸地由黑變紫的皮膚，對照着揮動的鋤頭，雪亮的鐵鑿，一切的一切，都呈現着「人肉」和「力」的展覽。</p>
<p>這時，河底一薄層汚濁的泥水，一叢叢的殘藻，和着許多死掉的小魚蝦，被太陽薰炙得發酵，不斷地發出惡劣的臭氣。一般督工的人們，早巳逃避了。他們悶得透不過氣來，祗得跑到河邊的楊柳樹下，伸一伸發酸的腰；可是那樹上惡作劇的花毛虫，又會給他們火辣辣的癢痛。有的，索性直頂着太陽的熱流，坐在自己的鋤頭或是鐵鍬的柄上，抽着黃烟，通一通鬱積在胸中的悶氣。</p>
<p>但這樣的休息，會有人去報告的。那時，督工的扮着臉孔跑來，他們又祇得一個個回到那油鍋似的河底去，有的熱得沒法，就倒在泥水裏打個滾。</p>
<p>身上的汗快流完了。喉嚨的乾燥，身體的饑餓，逼得他們會去搶那担着過路的淸凉的井水喝。在夏天，他們不會有這末多的茶喝，而井水便成爲鄕村間最普遍的天然飲料了。</p>
<p>當他們看見誰挖到一個瓶子或是漁船上掉在水裏的一把漁叉時，許多條的視綫，都會立刻集中到它的上面；大家都幻想着，鋤頭的下面會有這些東西或更寶貴的金，銀，珠，寶，被發現，因此有時就會更加興奮地工作起來。可是，這樣的幻想是同太陽一般地會沒落下去，終於使他們失望了。</p>
<p>嘡嘡嘡的羅聲，隨着下去的太陽響了起來，報告一天的工作已完結了。於是他們拖着疲乏的身子，掮着笨重的工具，四散地回家去，同時每人心上打算着：「今天拚到十五個銅子了！」</p>

<h3 id="c245">家庭教師 <a href="#c245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— 正平</p>
<p>家庭教師這位置决難算得是一個優美的位置。這不但是牠的薪給微薄不足道，也是這種職業本身的不固定和沒有保障。一個家庭教師大半只是臨時或短期被聘請的。他雖在職，免不掉的仍時常要感到再席失業的威脅。我們知道，中上家庭的聘請家庭教師，大半是爲子女補習各項主要功課，以利升學考試或增進必須知識，而有其需要的。在這種塲合，一個家庭教師的聘書上所能規定的時期怕只能有三個月左右。有些在寒署假因種種緣故未能升學的學生，家長爲了他們以後升學的便利，也有特爲聘請一位家庭教師爲之補習各項重要功課的。而在這種塲合，服務期普通多亦不過十來個月，少則僅四五個月而已。自然也有家長特別信任家庭教師而爲更長期的僱用的，但這種事是極少見罷了。</p>
<p>雖然家庭教師的生活比一般的學校教師的生活尤爲淸苦，但渴望得到這種位置的人仍是車載斗量，不可計數。普通從師範學堂或高中拿到了一張文憑而沒有拿到相適應的知識的人，固然有不少以得到這種位置爲滿足，卽「學有專長」（？）的大學畢業生，在這十人中僅有一人能獲得職業的今日，他們的兩手，也未嘗不要向這種不足道的位置伸過來。失業的中小學教師，以及那些以家庭教師爲職業而現在閒着沒事幹的人，他們的眼睛也一定要注視到這可貴的位置。普遍的知識分子的失業，使得以當家庭教師爲莫大希望的人也有了普遍的過剩了。</p>
<p>說到家庭教師的報酬，我有進一步提一提他們每月可能的收入的必要了。這自然是有不同的數目的：從「薪金不計」到有特別介紹的人較可觀的收入，是可相差到數十元甚至百元以上之巨的。除了軍閥官僚政客大商買辦之類肯出百元以上的重金爲自己的少爺小姐們請專任家庭教師之外，普通中上家庭對於一位有教學經騐，有好資格的家庭教師的報酬，大致難超過五十元一月之數。在去年冬天有一位大學畢業的朋友，被河南某煤礦公司附設醫院的某醫生聘請去教他自己的兩個小孩和他同事的兩個小孩補習國英算，還是以月薪五十元作報酬的。他還致送那被請的先生路費大洋二十元。又有一個在大學教育科畢業的朋友，在外埠某中學把他的教員位置丟掉了，回到上海，虧了一位朋友的介紹，馬上又以每日服務三小時，月薪四十元的代價，到某公館裏去傳授他的學識了。上面說的是家庭男教師。至於家庭女教師，那是更可廉價的拍賣自己的學識。她們也有從大學走出來，而僅希望以每月三十元，二十五元，二十元，甚至十五元的微小數目來求得這種位置而不可得的。我有一位女同學，她讀畢了大學三年級，而家庭經濟能力不繼，迫得她非離開學校去自謀生活不可。因爲人精明，能幹，虧她同時覓得了兩處家庭教師的位置；她把上午兩小時分與一家公館，又以下午兩小時分與另一家公館。她終日坐不安席的奔波着，每天要花去三四角電車和黃包車錢，而她兩處所得，合計只不過大洋五十元而已。我又認識一位女士，也是從大學出來的，她曾經以每日三小時月薪三十元的代價，和本市某公館訂立了三個月的家庭教師的聘約。又有一位朋友的夫人，宣言願以月薪十五元拍賣一個家庭教師所可有的知識勞動力，但是她並沒有得到買主。像這一類從這腐爛的社會裏所發酵出來的悲慘事實，我們是隨時有機會見得到的。</p>
<p>因爲家庭教師必須到人們的「家庭」裏去教授，爲了時間與車費的節省，他們（或她們）有搬到東家公館附近去住的必要。這似乎注定他們要時常感受搬遷之累。還有除了少數的例外，東家大半是很少有同時供給家庭教師膳和宿的；單供給一餐火食的倒也有。在這種情形下，他們多半都必須躬自操作。因爲職業的短期與臨時性質，他們的生活自然難得安定，所以他們最大的希望是想找到一個較固定的職業了。一個中學教師的位置大槪是他們理想的目標，一個小學級任或科任的位置應該也很配合他們的胃口，就是一個普通的小學教師在他們也要認爲是一個不錯的地盤了。他們的這種希望大半又是不易實現的，因此他們仍舊是失業的時候多。</p>
<p>此外還有一種家庭教師，他們本來是有職業的，他們也許是一個中小學的教師或一個夜校或補習學校的教員，因爲收入的不足維持生活，而必須利用所謂「公餘之暇」到人家的公館裏去抓一筆「外快」的。這種人的勞苦忙迫自不待言。我有一個在某中學教英文的朋友，他除了每週任課十二小時外，還在一個公館裏每週任教六小時，每晚還借用一個小學替一些工廠和商店的職員及學徒們開補習英文的「特別班」。他的收入雖相當可觀，但他的勞苦却是任何人所不難想像到的。</p>
<p>最後我想提一提家庭教師所能碰到的困難。我們知道，家庭教師是被聘請來教授國英算等幾種主要功課的。一般人對於這幾種功課未必全精，若一旦在某種功課的講解上露出了破綻，或對提出的問題不能卽時予以圓滿的解答，則由此引起的學生的不信仰，在以後的教授進程上是會有很大的問題發生的。學生不聽話自不用說，東家的不信任也是必有的結果。這時候這個教師自然就難得再維持下去了。</p>
<p>還有，一個家庭中子女的年齡學級程度等常有很大的區別：這裏不適用「班級教學」制，你得一個一個的細心去指點。雖然學生人數不一定很多，然由程度不齊所引起的麻煩事定不會少。這時你只有耐心的教，你必須捺住你心頭的火，免得因你的暴躁致引起你職業上的不愉快。「公館」裏不是可容許你發脾氣的地方，而那些貴公子和千金們也不會甘心來看你的顏色的。當這種時候你最好是向「社會」去算賬吧，我以爲。</p>
<p>藝壇</p>
<h3 id="c246">我們需要看什麼電影 <a href="#c246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— 丙甲</p>
<p>近來影壇上發生了一種所謂軟性論與硬性論之爭。主張軟性論者，以爲電影唯一的目的，是給觀衆以官感上的娛樂，所以，影片應該是羅曼狄克的，肉感的，滑稽的。主張硬性論者，則以爲電影的最終目的，不僅娛樂觀衆，而是教育觀衆，給觀衆以精神上意識上的滋養，所以影片應該是，且必然要是寫實主義的，內容充實的。我不是電影理論家，對於這兩種意見不想加以批評，只想以一個觀衆的立塲，給他們一點參考的材料。然而，在說到正文以前，還得提一提的，是這次論戰發生的原因及其重要性，</p>
<p>×　×　×　×</p>
<p>因爲電影是最接近一般小市民的，電影的效能比一切藝術作品都要大，牠不僅給觀衆一種槪念，而且是動作和具像，所以牠一發生，便成爲社會特殊階層有力的擁護者，卽是，社會的特殊階層利用牠爲統制一般小市民的思想的工具。在中國，電影藝術雖然比歐美各國幼稚，但牠的發展和作用却沒有例外，試看，牠不是從火燒紅蓮寺等而發展到啼笑姻緣，而發展到姊妹花，王先生嗎？</p>
<p>但社會不是單純的和靜止的東西，大衆（小市民）也不是個整體，無論你是怎樣注射麻醉藥，終不能阻止社會的進展，終不能一網打盡，使大衆永遠昏迷，而有一些人要從你的麻醉下脫逃出去。這樣便形成了電影藝術（任何藝術都是一樣）發展上的一種不可調和的矛盾：一是特殊階層的擁護者，一是大衆自己所要求的食糧。這就是軟性電影與硬性電影論爭發生的根本原因。</p>
<p>目前，不甘昏迷的大衆日漸增多，於是一方面大衆化藝術成爲唯一的藝術運動，佔領了整個藝壇，另一方面，舊時代的支持者，也就必然要出死力與之對抗，形成整個復古運動的開展。去年電影藝術運動曾澎湃一時，啟示了電影前途的新生機，產生了不少的大衆電影，雖然大半沒有公映的機會。這當然要使那些電影界的遺老遺少們感到不安，必然地他們要在整個復古運動的卵翼下，和文壇上的「文言復興」一樣，伸出他們紙般的拳頭來一次反攻。「軟」「硬」之爭是表明了電影運動已經不是閉門造車的時候，不僅是理論鬥爭的時候，而且是正面衝突爭生存的時候。</p>
<p>×　×　×　×</p>
<p>那末，站在觀衆立塲的我們，怎樣呢？我們究竟需要什麼電影呢？簡單說，我們是需要硬性電影而不需要軟性電影。我們是處在艱苦的時代，我們的生活是極其艱苦的。固然我們是十分需要娛樂，需要感官上的安慰，但不是如軟性論者那樣忖度的一樣，只要有狂烈的擁抱接吻以及女人的大腿就會使我們快樂得昏迷，不！决不是如此！我們需要意識上的刺激，遠超過於需要肉體上的刺激。我們要笑，但我們却不作無謂的笑，我們要從電影上獲得一點生的機能才笑。我們一切的教育機會，文化滋養，都被人剝奪罄盡了，電影才是簡便明白的，能增加我們的知識和生的力量的東西；倘我們只把這當做娛樂，那不是我們自絕於文化，自甘餓死嗎？舉例來說，同時開映的漁光曲與王先生事實上，便給了軟性論者以無情的打擊，王先生的胡調終不敵漁光曲有生活內容之能獲得廣大觀衆。這不是勉强來的，而是我們觀衆的實際要求。</p>
<p>我希望電影觀衆們以我們實際的要求來判决軟硬論爭的勝負！</p>

<p>(Tianjin) This morning, Yin Rugeng received a telephone report from Yutian, stating that more than one hundred plainclothes troops, secretly controlled by Shi Yousan and led by a certain leader named Zhang, were suddenly discovered in Dongguanshanzi, Yutian County. They were well-equipped with guns and ammunition, both large and small, and were spying on the county seat. Yin immediately telegraphed the security team stationed in the county to take strict precautions and reported to Yu Xuezhong when visiting him at noon, requesting instructions on countermeasures to prevent chaos. At the border of Ji County, Zunhua, and Fengrun counties, a group of people resembling bandits claiming to be Shi Yousan's plainclothes troops appeared on the 23rd. About one hundred forty to fifty people, two-thirds armed with pistols and one-third unarmed. Upon hearing the news, the Ji County Security Team, led by Captain Wei Yonghe, went to search. According to the report, they had already disappeared without a trace. (25th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) A large group of bandits suddenly appeared in San Nüer River, Fengrun County, on the 22nd, wearing various plainclothes military uniforms and armed with more than fifty large guns and several pistols, numbering about eighty. The bandits all had a liking for white powder and smoked it on the spot. The police station intercepted them as they passed by. The bandits claimed to be from Liu Zuozhou's troops, going to a certain place to suppress bandits. The police station prepared accommodation and food for them and telegraphed Liu to inquire, but received a reply that they were imposters. Therefore, on the afternoon of the 23rd, they contacted the local militia and surrounded the bandits in Zhang Zhuangzi. A fierce battle broke out between the two sides. Two bandits have been killed or wounded, but they are still stubbornly resisting. County Magistrate Zhang Renli led a large team of police and militia to the rescue on the 24th. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Shi Yousan recently sneaked back to Tianjin from Changchun, accompanied by the traitor Ma Henggui. Ma was the leader of the plainclothes troops during the Tianjin Incident.

<p>(Tianjin) Yin Rugeng came to Tianjin on the night of the 24th and visited Yu Xuezhong at the Provincial Government this morning to discuss the public security issues in the Ji-Mi area. He will return to Beiping by train on the morning of the 26th. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Su Yuqi, Director of the Shanhaiguan Public Security Bureau, Zhao Xun, Director of the Tangshan Public Security Bureau, Liu Zuozhou, Commander of the First Security Regiment of the War Zone, and Zhao Lei, Commander of the Second Security Regiment, all came to Tianjin. This afternoon at 2:00 PM, Yu Xuezhong summoned them separately to give instructions on methods to maintain public security and suppress bandits in the war zone and Tang-Yu area. Regarding the suppression of bandits, Su, Zhao, and others each expressed their opinions, and discussions lasted for half an hour. It was decided that the Tang-Yu area would be the responsibility of the police and public security teams of the respective public security bureaus, while Luan County, Leting, Qian'an, Fengrun, would be the responsibility of Liu Zuozhou and Zhao Lei. Su Yuqi, Zhao Xun, and Zhao Lei are scheduled to leave Tianjin on the 27th to return to their posts, while Liu Zuozhou will return to his defense area on the evening of the 26th. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Liu Zuozhou said that his troops total 2,000 men, organized into three battalions and one training corps. Lower-level squad leaders are successively enrolled in the training corps for training, with each term lasting three months. His troop's defense area is designated as Luan County, but he must also assist if something happens in the neighboring Leting County. The most famous of the bandit leaders in the defense area are three, two of whom have recently been captured. There is still one, nicknamed "Third Battalion Commander," who is at large and has not been apprehended. No large groups of bandits have been seen. The local public security is not as chaotic as rumored outside. Liu is a native of Haicheng, Liaoning, in his thirties, and there are many newspapers piled up in front of him during the conversation, resembling a shrewd person. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhao Lei said that he didn't have much to do with Minister He. He summoned us, talked a lot, and then gave a speech, teaching us to maintain local public security and manage our subordinates. I am not afraid of rumors and have always dared to act and take responsibility. There is no true right or wrong in the world. Whoever succeeds will manage it. If there is something I want to do, I will do it, and I am not afraid of being scolded by others or written about in the newspapers. What harm can other people's scolding and newspaper propaganda do to me? This spring, during the Kailuan mining strike, many newspapers said how I was. I didn't try to defend myself. If I were a bad person, why would Kailuan Mining give me six tons of coal dust every month and even want to give me a car? I didn't dare to take it. I have my own ideas and opinions on how to do things. I am not afraid of public opinion or being scolded by others. Zhao spoke with a rather exaggerated and impulsive attitude. He is a black and short man from Liaoning in his forties, possessing the qualities of an uneducated and crude military man. (25th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Official Plans for Mining</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) A gold mine was discovered in Zhangsizhanggou, Daixian County, Jinbei, 60 li from the city. Yan ordered the Northwest Industrial Company to send personnel to investigate and formulate mining methods. Zhao Liankui and Cao Yangbin, the two commissioners previously sent by the Department of Industry to inspect, have returned to the province. According to them, the mining area is about 20 li, and there is a lot of sand in the ditch. The gold quality is produced in the lower layer of the sand. During the flood season in spring and autumn, a large amount of gold sand can be washed down from the mountains, and the yield is quite high. Initially, Li Weiming, a native of Qingyuan, Shanxi, who was driven back to Shanxi after being excluded from mining in the Northeast, went to try mining, gradually attracting the attention of local people. At present, the number of residents nearby who are panning for gold reaches three to four thousand people a day, like a market. Each person can pan for more than one qian of gold per day. Since mining began, about two months ago, about five to six hundred liang of pure gold have been panned, all of which have been purchased by personnel sent by the Jin shops in the city. Now, the authorities, considering that the people are free to mine, fear that disputes will arise, and intend to restrict it in accordance with regulations, and the authorities will also raise funds to develop other mining methods.

Previously, there were scattered bandits active in Yunyang and Yunxi, but they were suppressed and driven away by Xiao Zhichu, fleeing to the border between Sichuan and Shaanxi. The Gucheng-Zhushan highway is being constructed in sections by the 82nd and 44th Divisions. The Fancheng office is being taken care of by Guan Linshu nearby. Northern Hubei experienced severe flooding this year, so it was spared from drought. The autumn harvest is expected to be about 70-80%, but it is still difficult to be self-sufficient.

<h3 id="e44">Discussion on the Theory of Preventing Silver Outflow <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— Tong</p>
<p>Since the large outflow of silver from this port, it seems that everyone has been feeling uneasy, believing that silver is a precious metal, and excessive outflow indicates the impending doom of the national economy. Therefore, some people advocate adopting various methods to prevent outflow, such as prohibiting silver exports, purchasing silver to raise silver prices, and transferring funds without cash transactions. All of these are based on the premise of "safeguarding cash." Under the premise of "safeguarding cash," there is nothing wrong with this in principle. However, everyone should consider how much possibility there is for the realization of such a proposition.</p>
<p>First of all, regarding the "safeguarding cash" aspect, in modern economic organizations, it is particularly necessary to pay attention to the effectiveness of safeguarding. Simply put, everyone knows that India is a country with extremely rich silver reserves, and its people have a habit of hoarding silver. However, India is still unable to escape its colonial status. Japan's gold reserves are not very abundant, but its international balance of payments is often in a favorable position. With that said, we do not deny the special significance of centralized gold or silver reserves in today's society (such as preparing for war). However, what we want to point out is what kind of effect the centralized safeguarding of gold or silver can have on the national production process. If we only talk about gold or silver itself, it is nothing more than something that cannot keep you warm or fill your stomach. We should understand today's silver issue from this perspective.</p>
<p>Secondly, we should have a fundamental understanding of the significance of the United States' silver price increase movement this time. Some people say that the purpose of the United States nationalizing silver is for war preparedness. This is true. However, there is another important purpose: to compete with Britain and Japan in the markets of India, China, and other silver-using countries in the Far East in order to sell its inventory. This can be seen by looking at the news from London in recent days regarding the widespread use of the British Exchange Equalization Account. Therefore, we can say that the significance of the United States policy for our market lies in actively expanding trade. The United States is like this, and so are other countries.</p>
<p>Now, let's examine the significance of silver transfer. Obviously, the large export of silver this time is due to the excessive difference between silver prices at home and abroad, on the one hand. However, on the other hand, this is entirely due to our country's excessive lack of methods to make up for the international balance of payments deficit, so that domestic silver reserves are likely to flow out at any time. For the same reason, because rural areas lack methods to make up for the deficit, rural silver reserves cannot help but flow to "cities" that are flourishing based on the operation of imported goods. This is a phenomenon that political power cannot remedy. Of course, we do not deny that merchants who hoard or purchase silver with the aim of profiting from it are sufficient to hinder the principle of "silver safeguarding." However, we must know that the fundamental purpose of transporting silver at present is a kind of cargo trading activity. At a certain point in time, he can still transport the goods back if it is profitable. His fundamental motivation is to "invest capital to seek profit." As for where the cash is, he does not care.</p>
<p>So, in this situation, can we just let silver flow out in large quantities? Of course, that's not what we're saying. Before advocating how to prevent silver outflow, we must first look at the current state of our national economy. Everyone knows that a planned monetary policy can only be implemented when the national economy has developed to a considerable stage. Especially in today's fiercely competitive environment, the backing of monetary policy must not only be based on industrial productivity but also on the strength of political, diplomatic, and military forces. Our country, which has inevitably been "at the mercy of others" in the past, has never had any monetary policy. Can we suddenly come up with any propositions today? If you are afraid of silver outflow, try saying that you will not pay their freight (during wartime, it should be treated separately) and implement a clearing method. Do you think they will agree? Will they not find excuses to object? If not, try another method to stop the silver standard. Foreign merchants can still ignore all orders from our country, making all plans fundamentally impossible to implement.</p>
<p>Finally, we should also fundamentally recognize that while cash must be safeguarded, the way out for the national economy is even more important. If the state of the national economy cannot make any progress compared to the present, cash cannot be safeguarded. Even if it can be safeguarded, it is still "of no help to the people." Let's take a look at how abundant the cash Shanghai Chinese banks have collected from the interior in recent years is and how sufficient it is to indicate the concentration of funds. Then, let's look at the state of the cities and rural areas. I'm afraid no one will have a satisfactory conclusion. If that's the case, even if silver never flows out and is piled up in the silver vault, can our national economy have any future?</p>

<p>Including this Plan in Important National Policies</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Minister of the Army Hayashi, in view of the seriousness of the international situation in 1935 and the trends in the world aviation industry, keenly feels the need to expand and strengthen Japan's civilian aviation industry and make it fulfill the mission of the second line of national defense. As a result of repeated exchanges of views with Suetsugu Nobumasa and Admiral Osumi Mineo, a fundamental consensus has been reached. Minister Hayashi will include this plan in important national policies, submit it to the Cabinet for approval. It is reported that the Army Ministry's specific plan is as follows: (1) Treat civilian aviation as the second line of national defense and assist military aviation; (2) Establish an aviation bureau directly under the Cabinet to actively realize the following matters: expansion of civilian air routes, increase in civilian aircraft, and training of civilian aviation personnel.

<p>(Paris) The Socialist Party and the Communist Party Joint Association held a meeting tonight. A large number of people attended the meeting.

<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 25th from the acting ambassador in Paris, on August 21, a certain group in Paris went to the Japanese Embassy and nominated representatives to submit a letter of protest, but it was stopped by the police and nothing happened. On the 23rd, the committee for supporting the Soviet Union sent a letter of protest to the Japanese acting ambassador Mitani. This committee belongs to the extreme faction and is organized by 830,000 members from 21 groups. The content of the protest letter is as follows: French workers absolutely oppose Japanese acts of aggression and express great respect to those who are fighting imperialism in both Japan and Manchuria. We declare that we will start a movement against the Japanese government in France immediately. In addition, the representative of the committee requested the French government to maintain peace in the Far East regarding the Japan-Russia issue. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that after Japan withdrew from the League of Nations, anti-Japanese movements were organized in Paris and other places, considering it a disguised activity of the Third International, and is wary of the future.

<p>Japan-US and Japan-Russia Relations</p>
<p>War Is Impossible from an Economic Standpoint</p>
<p>(Tokyo) While the tax increase issue is being discussed in various aspects, Finance Minister Fujii told reporters at his official residence yesterday that the tax increase issue should be decided from a national standpoint, considering domestic affairs and the Empire's position in the East. The problem containing the future is not easy to decide. Moreover, the issuance of public bonds is by no means an expansionary measure. The budget for the next fiscal year will become a situation where expenditures are equal to revenues, so the revenue problem does not necessarily have to be limited to tax increases. These painstaking efforts will be announced concretely within days. Regarding the expansion of defense spending, the military believes that defense spending is a safe way to prevent foreign wars. However, given the current international relations, if considered from an economic point of view, there is no contradiction between the United States and Japan that would lead to conflict. Moreover, the United States is troubled by deficit bonds and economic insecurity, and it is not the time to engage in war. The United States, which recognizes the independence of the island, would come out and disrupt peace in the East, I am afraid that this will not happen. I believe that the United States will find it a better policy to seek economic satisfaction with Japan. As for the Soviet Union, dissatisfaction with its oppressive politics and poor economic life is rampant domestically, and the government's authority has completely collapsed. In particular, with only a few million Communist Party members suppressing more than 100 million people, in this situation, if an incident occurs, it is expected that the country will inevitably be unable to cope. Therefore, it is said that the Soviet Union must be hostile to Japan, that will not happen. (25th Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The income of national railways has recently increased significantly. According to a survey on the 23rd of this month, the income from passenger and freight fares exceeded the same period last year by 20 million yuan. The reason for this is that the domestic military industry is developed, and the transportation volume of coal, iron, kerosene, and other raw materials required by heavy industry has greatly increased, so this phenomenon has occurred.

<p>(Paris) This daily paper published an article, discussing the relationship between Soviet Russia and Japan, pointing out that the Soviet Union has repeatedly expressed its willingness for peace and strongly stated that in the current severe situation in the Far East, the Soviet Union's position is continuing to strengthen. The report also said, "The Soviet Union has achieved its undeniable success on the international stage, and the completion of its Five-Year Plan (most of which is seen in Siberia) has consolidated its existence, and seems to have changed the opinion of its position in the Far East." According to the newspaper, this change can also explain the Soviet Union's strong determination not to acquiesce to any intimidation or threat. The newspaper concluded by saying, "At the same time that the Soviet Union has actively succeeded internationally, Japan has withdrawn from the League of Nations, expanded its military, and carried out dumping in the international market, and as a result, Japan has increasingly become an object of suspicion for various countries."

The Shanghai correspondent of Le Petit Parisien published his opinion, saying that the conflict between Japan and Russia is not as terrifying in the eyes of the people in the Far East as it is in the eyes of the people in Europe. He said, "Although Tokyo and Moscow have both taken firm attitudes in diplomacy, the other side just laughs it off. They both know the extent of the bluff." Le Journal said that the real conflict is between Japan and the United States, because the naval competition between the two countries has reopened, and the main purpose is to compete for hegemony in the Pacific.

<p>(London) The Morning Post today published a letter from Lord Barnby, the leader of the British industrial mission to Manchuria, stating that the country's visit to Manchuria has nothing to do with political issues. The letter mentioned a report that quoted a statement he made, saying that according to a London representative of a certain Japanese newspaper, he had expressed his opinions on the political relations between Britain, Japan, and Manchuria. He felt that there must be some misunderstanding, because the mission he led to Japan and Manchuria has nothing to do with political issues, and political issues are not within the scope of the investigation at all. Moreover, he himself is not qualified to express opinions on political issues involving relations between Great Britain and other countries. He felt obliged to clarify in order to avoid misunderstandings about the purpose of the mission to the Far East. The mission to the Far East is purely non-official in nature and aims to promote commerce and hope that business figures on both sides will make friendly contact. According to reports, the delegation has four representatives from the British business community and is scheduled to depart from London tomorrow to "Manchukuo" to investigate everything and find out whether the British business community can cooperate with the local business community to seek publication.

<p>Britain Uses Equalization Fund to Maintain Gold Pound</p>
<p>1.5 Million Pounds Have Been Used</p>
<p>The United States Still Has a Large Amount of Gold Transported to Europe</p>
<p>(Washington) The United States still has a large amount of gold being transported to Europe today. Experts are wondering what the outcome will be. New York bankers claim that $1,060,000 in gold will be transported to Europe immediately. If the government does not change its silver policy, then gold exports will increase sharply. People generally suspect whether the Treasury Department will be forced to raise the price of gold or continue to sell gold at a price of $35 per ounce when the dollar falls again, thereby profiting. Most financiers still believe that the government is trying its best to maintain the status quo. Treasury officials are now closely monitoring the flow of international currencies, especially rumors about foreign exchange and their impact on the dollar. The Treasury Department still denies that a currency war will occur with Britain. News from London today said that the British Equalization Fund purchased millions of pounds in gold. The Federal Reserve Board in Washington announced today that gold holdings increased by $4 million this week, and the reserve for gold certificates increased by $2 million, which proves that the Treasury Department's gold reserves are balanced. (24th Kuo Min News Agency)</p>
<p>(London) The recent decline of the pound compared to the firmness of the dollar shows that Britain and the United States are now pursuing their own currency policies, which are diverging. The continued decline of the pound is a force that lowers prices and is still at work, such as the outflow of British funds. Some pessimism exists, not only limited to the pound, but also because of the possibility that the United States' reduction in currency value, although denied by Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, may be doubtful whether the current price of the dollar can be maintained if the currency value is indeed reduced. The general opinion here is that the weakness of the pound is due to the sale of gold pounds by continental Europe, coupled with the fact that British banks have recently transferred funds to Paris, because French short-term bond yields are more favorable. New York's export of gold has stabilized the price of the dollar today, but the future of the dollar is not without concern. This is why continental Europe is selling. British authorities used the exchange equalization fund yesterday to maintain the gold pound. The number is different, some said 1 million pounds, some said 3 million pounds, but according to the most reliable news, about 1.5 million pounds were used. (25th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The British-French exchange rate fell to 75 francs 73 today, while the closing price yesterday was 76 francs 03. Today's price has created a new low. Britain is expected to take active measures to maintain this price and wait for it to continue to fall. The dollar price yesterday was 14.93, which is relatively stable today. (25th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) The Times today published an editorial, admonishing the continuous outflow of silver from China, saying that after the US government passed the Silver Purchase Act in May, in addition to nationalizing the domestic silver, it also purchased silver in large quantities abroad, causing the price of silver to rise and undermining China's ability to sell its goods overseas. The United States' relationship with silver is far less important than China's. China should have the right to speak in plans to raise silver prices in order to control it, which is in line with reason. If the economic disorder reaches the point of forcing China to abandon the silver standard or forcing it to adopt strict austerity, it would not only be a great misfortune for China, but also a great misfortune for Western exporters.

<p>To Extend the Naval Conference for Two Years</p>
<p>Negotiations Are of No Use Now</p>
<p>(Washington) Responsible officials here stated today that the State Department supports extending the naval conference for two years. The current situation does not allow the conclusion of a new treaty, so extending the London Naval Treaty for two years may solve the naval problem. However, responsible officials deny that this matter was initiated by London. Official declarations say that it is impossible to achieve any agreement next year, given the tense political situation in Europe and Asia, and extending the naval conference will give major naval powers time to reach a better understanding with each other and then decide on specific naval policies. The current goal of naval powers is to increase rather than reduce naval strength. Japan's demand for equality, Britain's demand for building 22 more cruisers, and the active shipbuilding of the United States, Italy, and France are three new developments that will undermine the success of the 1935 conference. Extending the Washington and London Treaties for two years or until 1940 is not difficult, but Japan may declare that it will abandon the current treaty, which will see global naval competition break through historical records.

President Roosevelt's statement is a response to this criticism. The President said that Wallace's argument only involved one-sided economic reasons and forgot that there were other reasons, such as national defense, which are even more important. The United States has a need to consolidate the shipping industry, for the following reasons: (1) National defense; (2) The United States is not involved in the war during wartime; (3) Preventing foreign mail shipping companies from raising water feet. Harryman, president of the American Chamber of Commerce, is also a supporter of the shipping industry, saying that the shipping industry is now extremely declining, and any further hindrance will have unimaginable consequences.

<p>(Washington) The State Department admitted today that negotiations between Soviet Russia and the United States regarding the $768,500,000 debt have reached a stalemate. After receiving a counter-proposal on the debt issue from Soviet Russian Ambassador to the United States, Troyanovsky, the State Department immediately informed reporters that an agreement was unlikely. The US-Russia debt negotiations had moved from Washington to Moscow, and then from Moscow back to Washington, but no progress was made. This debt consists of foreign bonds issued by the Tsarist and Kerensky governments, which the Soviet Russian government refuses to acknowledge. Furthermore, the Soviet Russian government seized American property worth $440,000,000 after taking power, and this issue is also being negotiated together. The reason the State Department is reluctant to admit that the negotiations have broken down is that leaders in the business community deeply hope that the restoration of diplomatic relations between Soviet Russia and the United States will expand trade between the two countries.

<p>Containing Japan and Italy</p>
<p>The Turmoil in the Far East</p>
<p>Led to the Two Countries Agreeing</p>
<p>According to a report in the Tokyo Hochi Shimbun on the 18th, after the conclusion of the Locarno Treaty in Eastern Europe, the Franco-Soviet alliance, which has close ties, has also been completed. Among the countries of Eastern Europe, with a spirit of mutual assistance, Germany is isolated in Western Europe. At the same time, in order to resist Japan in the East, Russia has joined the alliance. Therefore, at the League of Nations General Assembly in September, Russia will be one of the permanent council members. If so, the complex international relations in Europe will have a great impact on the Far East. However, it is incomprehensible that informed people in Japan regard this as commonplace. The occurrence of this matter, although originating in Europe itself, must also be said to be due to the turbulent international relations in the Far East, which have contributed to it. The politicians in Moscow, in the partnership of Russia and France, all have the concept of "the terror of Japan and Germany." The urgency of today's Russian war is deeply reflected in the minds of Europeans, which is truly unfortunate. Russia, situated between Japan and Germany, must have prior preparations. Even if Germany is not currently taking action, Russia must also defend the Far East in order to preserve the borders of Europe in the event of an emergency. Since Hitler took power, Russia has felt particularly uneasy about the West. However, why are France and the Little Entente countries so eager to approach Russia? One reason is that Stalin and Litvinov's practical policies have restored the trust of Western Europe, and another reason is that Germany's current situation is almost the same as that of Russia and France. (Omission) Therefore, Russia's revival of the pre-war Franco-Russian alliance is a measure of self-defense. However, from the French perspective, the Franco-Russian alliance was originally a defense against Germany, but it inevitably has the intention of containing Japan. Today, French public opinion on Japan is the same as that of Britain, divided into two factions. The right-wing sympathizes with Japan, while the center and left-wing supporters of the alliance oppose Japan. Russia is vigorously promoting Japan's aggressive ambitions in order to stir up world public opinion. Therefore, it is clear that the current Franco-Russian rapprochement is increasingly unfavorable to Japan.</p>

<p>Detailed Reports on Disaster Conditions in Various Counties</p>
<p>Hungry People Flock to the Wuhan Provincial Government, Requesting Urgent Relief</p>
<p>Affected Counties Divided into Three Grades for Relief Based on Severity</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: The Hubei Province suffers from severe drought and flood disasters, with no harvest from fields and a shortage of grain. The disaster victims in various counties, including Huang'an, Macheng, Huangmei, Guangji, Qichun, and Huanggang in eastern Hubei, and Daye, Yangxin, Puqi, Xianning, Chongyang, and Wuchang in southern Hubei, are facing dire straits. Initially, they abandoned their homes and committed suicide due to famine. Subsequently, they resorted to seizing and robbing grain. Now, they are gathering crowds to commit violence, leading to tragic incidents. Those closer to the provincial capital have mostly come to seek food. Both Wuhan areas are experiencing overcrowding. A few days ago, more than 1,000 disaster victims from Puqi came to the provincial capital, petitioning the provincial government, the civil affairs department, and the relief association. Their miserable condition was unbearable to witness. The authorities, concerned with public order, have already taken measures to disperse them. On the 23rd, the provincial government telegraphed the Central Relief Commission again, requesting urgent relief. The telegram stated, "Respected members of the Nanjing Relief Commission, your esteemed telegram is acknowledged. The register of disaster areas and the relief plan are being prepared promptly by the Civil Affairs Department in conjunction with the Relief Association. However, the disaster situation in Hubei Province is worsening daily. Hungry people are flocking to Wuhan, and the provincial government is struggling to provide urgent relief and dispersal, which is beyond its capacity. Moreover, in areas affected by bandits, it is particularly important to seek immediate pacification to prevent the spread of unrest. It is proposed to allocate a certain amount of urgent relief funds to address the immediate crisis. We anxiously await your response. Respectfully, the Hubei Provincial Government." The Disaster Relief and Famine Preparedness Committee believes that the method of relief should be differentiated based on the severity and urgency throughout the affected areas. Therefore, the affected counties have been divided into three grades. Generally, Puqi, Huangmei, Guangji, Huanggang, and other counties are classified as first-grade disaster areas. Qianjiang, Mianyang, and other counties are classified as second-grade disaster areas. Jianshi, Shishou, and other counties are classified as third-grade disaster areas. Relief will be distributed according to these grades. Meanwhile, personnel will be dispatched to Sichuan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Henan, and other provinces to purchase rice and grain and conduct large-scale price stabilization measures. The provincial government has also ordered all counties to release the accumulated grain in their granaries for price stabilization to maintain stability. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is deeply concerned about the disaster situation in Hubei Province. In addition to repeatedly telegraphing the Central Government to coordinate relief efforts, he has also telegraphed the Hubei Provincial Government to compile a comprehensive report on the details of the disaster and submit it for review. The telegram stated, "Since the beginning of summer this year, the weather has been severely dry, and the autumn harvest in rural areas is hopeless. Reports of disasters from various provinces have been pouring in. Looking ahead, there is cause for deep concern. In addition to the disaster relief and drought prevention plan of your province and the effective plans for implementation, which have been telegraphed separately for detailed reporting to seek active relief, a precise investigation of the actual disaster situation in your province is necessary as a basis for a comprehensive plan. The affected area of each county, the severity of the disaster, the quantity of grain lost, the number of affected households, whether there are storage facilities in the disaster area, and whether there are alternative grains available nearby should all be thoroughly investigated and compiled into a comprehensive report to be submitted for review within a time limit. The columns in the table should comply with the previous order and should not be exaggerated or falsely reported, which would mislead the situation." (23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e92">Four Breaches at Changyuan <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The Liu Embankment Completed Successively</p>
<p>Over Three Hundred Villages in Hua County Flooded</p>
<p>Precarious Situation Upstream in Zhongmu</p>
<p>Kaifeng Dispatch: He Youliang, an engineer from the Yellow River Conservancy Commission stationed at the Hebei River Affairs Bureau to assist in flood prevention, telegraphed Commission Chairman Li Yizhi today, reporting on the situation of the breaches at Changyuan. He stated that the Liu Embankment at the original 25th and 21st openings was completed on the evening of the 18th. The Liu Embankment at the original 8th and 17th openings was completed on the evening of the 20th. The Liu Embankment at the original 25th opening is 172 meters long, the original 21st is 120 meters long, the original 8th is 230 meters long, and the original 17th is 210 meters long. The silt accumulation on each Liu Embankment is quite effective. Efforts are currently being made to extract soil and rush to close the openings. The Henan Provincial Party Affairs Commissioner's Office also telegraphed the Central Government today, requesting it to forward the telegram to the National Government, instructing the Executive Yuan to urgently order the Hebei Provincial Government to close the breaches and to quickly allocate large sums of money for the urgent relief of disaster victims in Yu (Henan) and Hua counties who have been flooded. The original telegram stated, "The Changyuan levee of the Yellow River in Hebei Province was breached last year due to lack of defense, inundating houses and causing extreme misery. The affected area has not yet recovered its vitality. This year, the flood season has arrived, and no precautions were taken in advance, resulting in the same mistake. The old breaches that were closed last year between Shitou Village and Dacheji have successively collapsed again. Dozens of villages outside Changyuan City have suffered another catastrophe, and more than 200 villages in Hua County, Henan Province, have also been affected. The disaster situation is very serious. Moreover, the flood season has not yet passed. If another flood occurs, the impact on the levees on the north bank of the Yellow River in Henan will be even more worrying. According to various sources, the collapse of the levee this time was indeed due to insufficient manpower and delayed rescue efforts. In addition, the soil quality of the new levee was sandy and lacked mud, and the gullies and wave troughs were not filled firmly. The levee protection project was also not constructed, and the levee foundation was not strong. There were no sheds built on the north and south sides of the levee for the laborers to be responsible for guarding. Once the flood season arrives, they will be submerged. The river affairs authorities and engineering personnel of the province have failed to perform their duties effectively and cannot shirk their responsibility. We believe that the state has spent a huge amount of money to assign specialists to handle river defense, but they have not been able to do everything within their power, resulting in another catastrophe. How can the common people bear this again? We have heard that the Executive Yuan has ordered the Hebei Provincial Government and the Yellow River Conservancy Commission to investigate and severely punish the responsible personnel, which is sufficient to clarify rewards and punishments and appease public grievances. As for the disaster area, families have been ruined and are crying out for food. Urgent relief and post-disaster recovery are of utmost importance. Therefore, we urgently telegraph, requesting that the National Government be immediately informed and instruct the Executive Yuan to order the Hebei Provincial Government to find a way to close the collapsed openings before the arrival of the main flood to avoid future troubles. At the same time, allocate large sums of money quickly to provide urgent relief to save the disaster victims. We cannot express our urgent hopes enough. The Henan Provincial Party Affairs Commissioner's Office, worship print."</p>
<p>A telegram from Mazhen, Shanzhou (21st) stated that the Yellow River water level had risen sharply again by one meter and fifty-nine centimeters. At noon, it rose another two centimeters. Chen Ruzhen, the director of the River Affairs Bureau, immediately telegraphed each sub-bureau to be vigilant and ordered the director of the Shangnanliu Sub-bureau to personally go to the old course of the Yellow River in Lanfeng and the civilian embankments in Kaocheng to supervise the construction and guard. Chen himself, together with Tao Jizheng, rushed from Liuyuankou to Rongze Flood Control Station to inspect the river. The dikes were all solid, and the projects could be guaranteed to be safe. However, the sixth dam of the Eight Forts upstream in Zhongmu was directly impacted by the main current, with the head of the dam collapsing by one zhang and five chi and the tail collapsing by two zhang. The newly purchased stones had not yet arrived, and the situation was relatively dangerous. The director of the Shangnansu Sub-bureau was immediately ordered to quickly transfer nearby stored stones for emergency relief. It is currently being protected by throwing stones, and it is expected to stabilize in a few days. (22nd)</p>

<h3 id="e94">Sichuan Province <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Mountain Torrents Cause a Strange Disaster</p>
<p>The Tuo and Min River Basins are the Most Severely Affected</p>
<p>Chengdu Dispatch: Although Sichuan is mostly mountainous, it also has many rivers. The name Sichuan is derived from the four major rivers, the Jinsha River (the long main river), the Min River, the Tuo River, and the Jialing River, which flow through the province. They are all formed by the confluence of hundreds of streams, originating from deep mountains and remote valleys, with steep terrain. Once mountain torrents erupt, they cannot be discharged in time, often causing floods. Since the beginning of summer this year, continuous rain has plagued various places, causing the riverine areas to suffer a strange disaster unprecedented in a century. The bandit suppression areas, such as Suixuan, Wanyuan, Guangyuan, and Nanjiang counties, and the non-bandit areas, such as Shiqi, Guanghan, Pengxian, Xinfan, and Wenjiang counties, have been the most severely affected. The true extent of their losses has been确实 ascertained. It is still unknown how many other places have not been fully investigated or have suffered lighter disasters or have recently been flooded. The basins of the Tuo River and Min River are particularly affected, as their tributaries are numerous, the terrain is relatively flat, and accumulated water is more difficult to drain. Liu Xiang and the Pacification Committee here believe that Sichuan's bandit troubles are not yet over, and this strange disaster has struck again, leaving it riddled with holes and unable to save itself. They have telegraphed Chairman Lin, Chairman Chiang, Premier Wang, Minister Kong, and the National Relief Commission, requesting them to consider the plight of the Sichuan people and allocate large sums of money for relief. Two telegrams have been obtained, and their original texts are disclosed below:</p>
<p>(Telegram Requesting Relief) (Titles Omitted) Esteemed officials, I have learned that since the beginning of summer this year, continuous rain has fallen in Sichuan Province, and mountain torrents have suddenly erupted. The Min, Tuo, Jia, and Ya rivers have successively flooded, inundating vast areas. According to reports from various counties, those near the mountains include Dazhou, Xuanhan, Wanyuan, Guangyuan, Wenchuan, Anxian, Danling, Jiajiang, Hongya, Emei, Ebian, Gongxian, Pingshan, and Changning counties. Those along the rivers include Dayi, Qionglai, Pujiang, Xinjin, Shuangliu, Leshan, Qianwei, Pengshan, Ziyang, Santai, and Deyang counties. In addition, the counties near Chengdu, which have always relied on the Dujiangyan irrigation system, have also suffered flooding due to excessive rainfall. The water level at Baopingkou has risen to around 23 lines. The stone weirs for diverting water from the two rivers have been washed away, causing Guanan, Pixian, Wenjiang, Xinfan, Chongning, Pengxian, Guanghan, Shifang, and Jintang counties to suffer flooding. People's fields and houses have been destroyed, and their belongings have been washed away. The living are exposed to the elements and hungry, unable to guarantee their survival. The dead are floating in the water, unable to be buried. The entire land is filled with mournful cries, and the situation is extremely tragic. The most severely affected areas include Lijia Nian in Shifang County, Jiuchi Pu in Pengxian County, the fourth district of Wenjiang County, and Huangdan Chang in Pingshan County. The entire population, livestock, and houses in the town have been washed away by the floods, and few residents have escaped. This is a major disaster unprecedented in decades. In addition, Guangyuan has also been hit by hailstorms, while Qijiang, Youyang, Xiushan, Qianjiang, and Cangxi counties have suffered prolonged droughts, causing the crops to wither and die, and they have reported drought disasters, with no hope for the autumn harvest. The water and drought disasters in the above counties all urgently require relief. I am lacking in ability to provide comfort and am deeply responsible. I have separately instructed local civil and military officials, legal entities, and respected elders to rush to provide urgent relief and ordered the counties affected by the floods to rush to protect and defend, and to do their best. I have not dared to bother you with a request for relief. However, Sichuan suffered a drought disaster last year, and the efforts to provide urgent relief have exhausted all resources. This year, water and drought have occurred simultaneously, and the disaster area is vast. At this time, the suppression of the bandits is urgent, and military needs are enormous, causing financial strain. It is difficult to continue. Seeing the misery of the displaced, it is indeed beyond my power to rescue. I believe that you, esteemed officials, have the people's suffering at heart and are looked up to by all. News reports that the Executive Yuan has telegraphed all provinces affected by disasters to investigate and report the disaster situation in detail, and I know that you have long been concerned about the disaster in Sichuan. I humbly request that you order the Ministry of Finance to allocate large sums of money and send personnel to Sichuan to investigate and distribute aid to rescue the disaster victims. I anxiously await your orders. I am only submitting a preliminary report of the disaster situation. Once the reports from all counties along the river are complete, I will submit a detailed supplementary report. In addition to separate telegrams to the Ministry of Interior and the National Relief Association, I am sending this telegram for your consideration."</p>
<p>(Telegram from the Pacification Committee) (Titles Omitted) Esteemed officials, the suffering of the people of Sichuan is deep. Both crop pests and disasters have struck, leaving the land full of scars. The banditry has lasted for years, and the suppression has not yet been fully completed. The water and drought disasters have successively been reported. According to investigations, the counties along the Qu River in eastern Sichuan, such as Suiding, Hanxuan, and Wanyuan, have recently suffered repeated floods. Li Shaoqian, the magistrate of Dazhou County, telegraphed that the county had suffered continuous heavy rain and flooding. The Qu River, from Luojiangkou to Mutoushi, a distance of over 200 li, had flooded, drowning over 100 people. Countless houses, livestock, fields, crops, and miscellaneous grains had been washed away. In the three districts outside the east, south, and west city walls, a total of five li in length, the houses and goods of the residents in the streets were all washed away. The total number of disaster victims in the county reached 3,000 families, with property losses exceeding 500,000 yuan. According to an investigation report from Xuanhan, the towns of Fan Kuai, Tuhuangba, and Huajianba in the county all suffered heavy flooding, resulting in huge losses. Zheng Guowu, the magistrate of Wanyuan County, telegraphed that the county had suffered two floods in the past month, and houses and livestock along the river had mostly been washed away. The cultivated land had been destroyed. The people in the recently recovered areas had suffered another disaster, and their livelihoods were on the verge of collapse. In northern Sichuan, the Jialing River rose sharply last month, and the magnitude of the flood was unprecedented in previous years, causing great losses in various places along the river. In particular, Guangyuan and Nanjiang suffered hailstorms in addition to mountain torrents, and the situation was extremely serious. The above areas had just experienced banditry and were now hit by floods. The survivors of the disaster were on the verge of extinction. We must earnestly request that you show sympathy for the people who have suffered multiple disasters and quickly allocate funds for relief. As for the non-bandit suppression areas, such as Shifang in western Sichuan, mountain torrents suddenly erupted in the middle of the night, and the river water rose sharply by several zhang, causing a violent flood. The affected area stretched for over 100 li and was over 10 li wide. More than 10,000 households were affected, with over 5,000 deaths. Over 10,000 people were homeless, with no possessions left. In Deyang, the river water rose sharply by three or four zhang in the middle of the night, causing the banks to collapse and the dikes to break. The water flowed in all directions, destroying over 3,000 houses and submerging nearly half of the county's fields. Over 3,000 people were drowned. In Guanghan, the large and small rivers rose simultaneously, and 80% of the rural towns became a swamp. The loss of submerged crops, livestock, destroyed houses, and land was difficult to count. In Peng County, floods spread along the river, submerging over 10,000 mu of fields and washing away over 1,300 houses. Over 900 people were drowned in Jiuchi Pu and Mengyang Town due to the sudden flood in the middle of the night. Over 130 people were drowned in other places along the river, and countless cattle, pigs, and sheep were lost. In Xinfan, mountain torrents erupted, and the fields, bridges, houses, and livestock along the river were mostly washed away and submerged, and over 200 men, women, and children were drowned. In Wenjiang, many of the bridges and dikes were destroyed, and the damaged crops and washed-away livestock were countless. In Heba Town, over 180 people were drowned due to the sudden flood in the middle of the night, as people were unable to escape. In southern Sichuan, Qionglai was hit by mountain torrents in the night, with the water level rising by two zhang. The houses of residents along the river were washed away by 600 or 700 families, and over 2,000 people were drowned. The amount of submerged fields and crops cannot be counted. In Pingshan, mountain torrents erupted in the night, and the river water rose sharply, washing away all the fields and crops along the river. All 300 or so houses in Huangdan Town were completely washed away, and over 300 people were drowned. In Gongxian, heavy rains fell for days, and mountain torrents erupted, causing the water level in the plains to rise by several feet, damaging fields, mountain soil, and houses, and causing countless damage to crops. The residents along the river were particularly affected, and many people and livestock were drowned. The above descriptions only mention the counties that have been most severely affected, and they are based on reports from local officials and gentry or investigations by members of this committee. They are all reliable and not fabricated. This is a strange disaster unprecedented in a century, which is heartbreaking and frightening. Although the authority of this committee is to pacify the bandit suppression areas, the banditry is not yet over, and natural disasters have struck again. If we want to prevent the banditry from spreading further, we must ensure the overall stability of Sichuan, but the people of Sichuan are impoverished and exhausted, and they are trapped in extreme poverty and unable to save themselves. Therefore, we humbly request that you show sympathy for the people of Sichuan and allocate large sums of money to provide relief to the people in the counties that have been most severely affected by this disaster, to rescue the starving and drowning, and to stabilize the region. We are extremely grateful. Zhang Lan, Chairman of the Sichuan Bandit Suppression Area Pacification Committee, bowing seal."</p>

<p>Bandits Conspire to Rob a Night Boat</p>
<p>The night boat from Zhoupu has always traveled between Zhoupu and Nancheng, carrying goods and money for various merchants and passengers, and it has never had any problems. However, last night, as the boat was returning from the city to Zhoupu and passing through Yaolu in Lidong Township, the seventh district northwest of Sanzao Town, more than ten li away from the county seat, suddenly a person on a small boat collided with it. Four passengers on the boat immediately drew out their pistols, threatened everyone to remain silent, and robbed all the belongings of the ten or so passengers on the boat. The boat owner, Feng Binggen, who was carrying a total of over 370 yuan in remittances from various merchants (Pinyin He et al.), was also completely robbed. They all got on the small boat and sped away. The total loss is estimated to be over 500 yuan. It is rumored that the bandits had learned that the merchants had entrusted the boat with a large amount of money, so they conspired to rob it.</p>

<p>The Embezzlement Case of Grain Tribute</p>
<p>Director Niu Orders County Magistrate Jin</p>
<p>The embezzlement case of grain tribute in the East Ward of this county, involving the conversion of fields and the misappropriation of provincial education funds, amounts to no less than 20,000 yuan. When the case was discovered, Director Niu of the Jiangsu Education Funds Management Office ordered the county to investigate and respond. The day before, County Magistrate Jin reported that Director Ye had concealed tax revenue and deserved punishment, so he had been placed under supervision and strict recovery efforts were underway. It is now known that Director Niu issued an order to County Magistrate Jin on the 22nd of this month, the full text of which is as follows: "Your report has been read and is being reviewed. According to a report from Supervisor Wu Baohuang, the investigation table of provincial education funds under the field tax item for each year filled out by the county shows a decrease compared to the actual tribute amounts for each autumn tax reported by previous finance bureau directors. The uncollected amounts for each year have also been reduced by over 10,000 shi of grain. The land price tax of the 22nd year, excluding the grain tribute, is certainly related to the embezzlement case of grain tribute in the East Ward. By checking the investigation table and the autumn tax amounts reported by previous directors, it can be seen that the reduced grain tribute is over 10,000 shi, and the suppressed grain tribute is over 4,000 shi. In fact, over 3,000 shi of grain tribute in the East Ward of Pubei has already been fully paid by each landowner. The 7,000 shi of grain tribute in the East Ward of Punan has also not been completely resisted by each landowner. Director Ye concealed the facts and submitted a vague report. The county government should consult the grain tribute atlas and recall the grain tribute seals to solemnly announce the reduction of the grain tribute amount and prevent embezzlement. The county magistrate's response to each item was not examined in advance and continued to shirk responsibility afterward. Director Ye is undoubtedly guilty, but can the county government shirk its responsibility? The case is important and should be thoroughly investigated. How can it be dismissed with a mere empty gesture of strict recovery efforts? According to the previous report, you should immediately comply and promptly submit a clear list of the protected land area and mu in the North and South Pubei field conversion grain tribute, and truthfully report why the autumn tribute amount filled in the investigation table does not match the amount reported by previous directors, whether the converted field grain tribute in South Ward is over 10,000 shi, and whether there was no income from the grain tribute in the 18th, 19th, 20th, and 21st years, to facilitate review. As for the newly appointed Director Yang, regarding all tax revenue, the store guarantee bond volume should be quickly copied and sent to this office for review. Do not delay, and this order is urgent."</p>

<p>In the middle of this month, Zhou Desan, Zhu Buxiang, and Wang Yongji, who were wearing uniforms and resembled military officers, suddenly came to Qibao Town and used counterfeit currency in various shops. Afterward, the shops noticed and reported to the Huazhuang Sub-station, which intercepted them. The shopkeepers who were victims were summoned for questioning. Zhou Desan and others pleaded guilty and were sent to the County Court. After investigation by the Prosecutor's Office, the facts were clarified, and a public prosecution was filed. After repeated trials, the verdict was announced on the 25th. Zhou Desan and Zhu Buxiang were each fined 200 yuan for using counterfeit currency, and Wang Yongji was acquitted.</p>

<p>On the 28th day of the twelfth lunar month last year, the Public Security Bureau seized two pistols at the home of Huang Yonggen in Aijiaqiao, within the city limits, and arrested Zhang Heyun and Ruan Axiao, two suspects in the robbery of Zhang Siqi's family at Huan'an. They were taken to the bureau for investigation. At that time, Huang Yonggen escaped due to a leak of information and had not been apprehended. After receiving a report, Fei Gongxia, a patrol officer of the Water Patrol Team, learned that Huang Yonggen was staying in Jinshanwei. He immediately dispatched Xia Shutang, the leader of the third squad, to lead a team to Weidongmen and capture Huang Yonggen. He was brought back to the team headquarters for interrogation today.</p>

<p>Joint Meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees of the Provincial Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The second joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees of the Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce was held on the 21st at the Wujiang County Chamber of Commerce. Chairman Yu Xiaochuan first gave a report, followed by a discussion of the agenda: (1) It was decided to continue to appeal for a reduction in the business tax on the grain industry to maintain people's livelihoods. (2) It was decided to submit another petition to the provincial government to abolish the egg tax in Suqian County and the education rice tax in Wujiang County. (3) It was decided to telegram the newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai to disclose the article "Exploration of the Shanghai-Beijing-Tianjin Native Place Associations in Jiangsu Province Printing and Mailing 30 Million Yuan of Jiangsu Province Public Bonds" to arouse the attention of the people of Jiangsu Province. (4) It was decided to petition the Economic Commission and the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Industry of the Executive Yuan to quickly stop the secret export of large amounts of silver. (5) It was decided that the tax amounts for tobacco and alcohol licenses in each county should still be paid according to the actual collection amount of the previous year.

<p>Farmers from Zhenze County, under the jurisdiction of this county, once looted rice and cakes last month. After the Public Security Bureau dispersed them, on the 19th of this month, suddenly two or three hundred farmers flocked from Zhenbei towards Hongqiao. The local police tried to dissuade them, but were met with resistance, and many were injured by thrown tiles. Afterwards, they went to the district office, the Public Security Bureau, and the Zhenze office of the Sericulture Improvement District, where they smashed desks, chairs, doors, windows, and wall panels. Then they went to the residence of Qiu Fuqing, a local resident, first moving kerosene and rice straw from neighboring houses, piling them up at the door intending to set fire, but were stopped by the pleas of the neighbors. However, the farmers then took iron tools and chopped open the front door, swarming in, and going all the way upstairs, ransacking chests and cabinets. A subsequent investigation revealed losses exceeding seven thousand yuan. Later, the county government dispatched a security team, and the farmers fled upon hearing the news. Currently, various sectors are requesting: (1) a thorough investigation to apprehend the ringleaders and bring them to justice; (2) that the district office and the district chamber of commerce continue to hold relief meetings, raise funds, and actively prepare a rice-lending bureau; (3) that the county security team, together with local police and militia, provide separate defenses.</p>

<p>More Than Thirty Prisoners</p>
<p>Plot Escape, Unsuccessful</p>
<p>Chen Zhen, the warden of this county's prison, was transferred by order, and his vacancy was filled by Li Yurui, newly appointed by the High Court. Li took office the day before yesterday. Unexpectedly, at 2:00 PM on the 24th, a prisoner named Li Xiaolao Guan requested to see the new warden, claiming to have something to report. Warden Li did not think much of it and went out to meet him. However, after seeing the warden, Li did not speak but headed outwards. More than thirty other prisoners followed, rushing out together. Warden Li, seeing that something was amiss, immediately ordered the guards to defend with live ammunition. Fortunately, they were able to suppress the situation effectively, and the prisoners were brought back under control. It is reported that the former Warden Chen had removed all shackles from the prisoners before leaving his post. This action seems premeditated and is currently under investigation.</p>

<p>The newly appointed County Magistrate of this county, Zhai Huan, was originally scheduled to arrive in Changshu on September 1st. However, due to the eagerness of the outgoing Zhou Heng to depart, and repeated telegrams urging him to come, he arrived in Changshu ahead of schedule on the 26th. He will officially take office tomorrow. It is said that most of the staff have been internally decided, and few of the old staff will remain. It is now decided that Secretary Cui Di, Section Chief Feng Qi of the first section, and Section Chief Tang Chengsi of the second section have already arrived in the county one after another, and are arranging everything. As for Section Chief Pang Shoubai of the third section, due to various highway construction issues, it has been decided that he will stay on. Furthermore, many of the government and police officers who came to Changshu with Zhou have now been replaced. It is said that after leaving office, Zhou will go to West Lake in Hangzhou to recuperate.</p>

<p>After the new indica rice came onto the market, rice prices stabilized slightly. However, due to the prolonged drought and dry riverbeds, prices are again expected to rise. There is not much rice stored here at present, and the market price has already reached around twelve yuan. According to those familiar with the rice market, it will soon reach thirteen yuan. In order to meet the demand, rice merchants, considering the limited local supply, have decided to purchase yellow rice from the Suzhou area to supply the market.</p>

<p>Preventing Locust Plague Amidst Drought Disaster</p>
<p>This year, the weather has been arid and dry, and the crops have withered, allowing locust nymphs to take the opportunity to invade the fields in the countryside, and they are often seen. Recently, the county government received a report from Zhao Hongbin, the district head of the sixth district, that locust nymphs were found in the area, damaging the rice crops. After receiving the report, Magistrate Yan, regarding the matter of preventing and controlling the locust plague, repeatedly received detailed instructions from provincial orders. If immediate measures are not taken to eliminate them, they will inevitably spread, causing endless harm. However, deeply concerned that the district heads may not pay enough attention, he specifically copied and distributed the Jiangsu Province's reward and punishment regulations for pest control personnel to the district heads yesterday, and telegraphed them to instruct the township chiefs to pay attention to prevention and control, and to report in detail whether there were any locust plagues in their areas.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Liyang Refugees Come to Wuxi to Beg for Relief <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The drought in southern Jiangsu Province is severe, and the disaster situation is serious. Since the beginning of autumn, there has been no rainfall, the crops have withered, there are no measures to draw water, and people's drinking water has become difficult. Although the disaster situation in Wuxi has not reached the most serious level, the rivers are also drying up, which is worrying. In recent days, a large number of famine refugees have been found near Gongyun Bridge and outside the West Gate, supporting the old and carrying the young, resting on the road. According to an investigation by our reporter, these refugees are mostly from Liyang. Because the crops in their hometown were hopeless, they wandered to Wuxi, without food or clothing, and their situation was very miserable. According to the refugees, since May 20th of this year, the entire county has only received five or six minutes of rain, and the land is red for thousands of miles, and most of the crops are hopeless. Robberies of rice have occurred from time to time. A farmer surnamed Gu from Dongxiang, with a family of six, men and women, who usually cultivated more than ten acres of land, committed suicide by poison with his entire family on the morning of the day before, because there was no grain in the house and no way to borrow. Furthermore, two brothers surnamed Di from Chengxi, each with more than 300 acres of fertile land, who were very generous in helping the poor and assisting the needy, distributed all the rice they had stored in their homes last month for relief, but it was just a drop in the bucket and did not solve the problem. Recently, the villagers went to request again, but the Di brothers could not cope and hanged themselves. Furthermore, Shi Amao, a villager from Chengbei, with a family of ten, had run out of food and could not survive, so he bought one yuan's worth of arsenic and all died in the middle of the night. Furthermore, the Liyang Infant Asylum has recently taken in many girls. Wang, a farmer from Shezhu, brought his wife to Liyang and put up a sign and sold his five-year-old son along the street. Later, Huang bought him for five yuan, and Wang used the five yuan to buy rice and returned home, separating flesh and blood. There were also two young women, each with three children, all young, who wanted to go out to make a living, abandoned their children, and left home, etc. Those who heard it were all saddened. In recent days, thousands of Liyang refugees have come to Wuxi on foot along the Xiyi Road, braving the summer heat. Fortunately, the villages they passed through did not harass them.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Important Proposals for the County Administration Conference <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The Wuxi County Government is scheduled to convene a county administrative conference on September 1st. Qian Sunqing, the director of the county assets office, has submitted three proposals, which have a chain relationship with the local finances of various counties and are extremely important. The topics are recorded as follows: (1) The county administrative conference should definitely adopt the local budget and final accounts as the central task, and hold meetings once before the start and after the end of each accounting year, in order to make public administration and facilitate local understanding. (2) County local funds should definitely be used locally in principle. If there are provincial offices that need to be operated locally, the purpose should also be clearly stated, and it must be related to the local area before it can be included in the budget, in order to clarify the boundaries and avoid confusion. (3) The drought is severe, the disaster is serious, and the social economy is unprecedented. The government should promptly concentrate manpower and financial resources to provide disaster relief and prepare for famine as the central task of the local government, and other construction projects that are not related to people's livelihoods should be stopped as appropriate to alleviate the people's strength and avoid heavy hardship. Furthermore, Yang Hanxi, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, also proposed to pre-plan work-relief measures to relieve the famine, which is also extremely important due to the heavy drought and disaster.</p>

<p>Township Head Extorts Money, Forcing a Person to Death</p>
<p>Xu, a farmer from Nan Si Li of Huian Town, Qidong, Cai Jianglang, was already fifty years old, and his family was poor. He had two sons, the eldest named Cai Gou, and the second named San Gou, who were each married and lived separately. The day before yesterday evening, San Gou's wife, Chen, went to Cai Gou's field and stole a watermelon. She was seen by Cai Gou's wife, Zhang, who arbitrarily insulted and scolded Chen, and reported it to Township Head Yu Chengrong, requesting an investigation. However, Yu indiscriminately ordered Cai Jianglang to pay twenty yuan as a settlement fee, otherwise he would be sent to the county jail. Cai panicked and became despondent, and hanged himself yesterday afternoon.</p>

<p>Ji Jianqing, a native of Jinsha, Nantong, moved to San Chang Market in this county in the sixth year of the Republic of China and opened Desheng Foreign Goods Store. For more than ten years, the business flourished and made a lot of profits. At the end of last year, he handed over the store business to his eldest son, Dehui, because he was old and frail and unable to work. However, Dehui was ungrateful and did not provide for his father. Ji Jianqing had no choice but to ask his son for living expenses. Dehui not only refused, but also beat his father and injured him, and confined him to an empty room. He suddenly died at midnight the day before yesterday, and was hastily buried the next day. The deceased's cousin, Juren, came to pay his condolences upon hearing the news and learned about the situation. He believed that Dehui had abandoned his relatives and caused death by injury, which was extremely unfilial and illegal, so he specially presented a petition to the county government for investigation.</p>

<p>Deadline is the End of August</p>
<p>Recently, the anti-smoking work of the Jiangsu Provincial Government has been gradually prepared in all aspects. Since the province issued various operating expenses to various anti-smoking committees, the work of the county councils has become more tense. This time, the registration of smokers is the most socially noted. According to the investigation, smokers in various counties, in view of the provincial government's determination to thoroughly eliminate the scourge of opium this time, in addition to those who voluntarily quit smoking in public and private hospitals, who are overcrowded, those who register in accordance with the regulations are particularly enthusiastic. The county councils are also very serious in handling this registration. In particular, more smokers have registered in Jiading, Baoshan, Jiangyin, and Jiangdu, reaching several thousand. It is also said that various counties are working hard to complete the registration of smokers in each county before August 31st.</p>

It is said that after the county magistrate inspects various districts on the 26th, he still intends to add one or two warehouses, and select appropriate local people to be hired as members to meet the statutory number. The directors of the first and second treasuries are still Yang Guoxiang and Xue Bofu, but the county committee affairs are selected by the members in accordance with the regulations. The members are not willing to serve, and Hu Min has been hired instead, with a monthly allowance of forty yuan.</p>

<p>Hu Jiaozhao, the director of the Jiangxi Highway Bureau, was previously instructed by Chairman Chiang to quickly repair Shangqing Palace on Mount Longhu in the province to include it as a tourist destination in the Southeast Transportation Exhibition. Hu immediately went to inspect it and added Guifeng in Yiyang County and Shuiyan Cave next to Mount Longhu as tourist destinations. The provincial government allocated 28,000 yuan to start the repairs. The route has been opened, and the residences of Chairman Chiang's headquarters and the guests are also being repaired. However, Shangqing Palace originally had no hotel facilities. Since the place has been listed as a tourist destination, it should be a place to stay according to the itinerary. In addition to repairing hundreds of rooms in the Tianshi Mansion and arranging reception halls for guests, Director Hu also wrote to the organizing committee of the Transportation Exhibition a few days ago, intending to ask the committee to take charge of all matters related to the hotel and accommodation for guests. It is said that the committee has sent personnel to contact China Travel Service to handle the matter and replied to Hu for verification.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Inside Story of the German June 30th Incident <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— Wuwei</p>
<p>= Division of Left and Right Wing Forces =</p>
<p>= A Glimpse of the Left Wing's Conspiracy =</p>
<p>Although Chinese newspapers and magazines have discussed the German June 30th incident extensively, the inside story remains a great enigma. After reading recent British and American magazines, the author has gained some insights and will describe them below for the reference of those concerned about international issues.</p>
<p>In simple terms, the German coup was a movement by the left wing of the National Socialist Party to seize power. Unexpectedly, Hitler was well-informed and preemptively struck, and the movement failed. Hitler's quick-witted action has won the admiration of those who worship heroes. In fact, the open and secret struggles between the left and right wings of the German National Socialist Party have not been limited to a single day. The ambitions of the left wing have been exposed from time to time, and the right wing has been attentive to dealing with them. Otherwise, Hitler's response to this incident would not have been so agile.</p>
<p>Hitler's plan to prevent the left wing from rebelling was already in the making in the spring of this year. One example is that at the 14th anniversary celebration of the National Socialist Party on February 25th, Hitler asked one million party members to re-swear their absolute loyalty to him personally. From this point of view, Hitler had already foreseen the left-wing division movement within the National Socialist Party. Therefore, in order to prevent problems before they occur, he took the action of asking party members to reaffirm their oath. The second point is that Hitler ordered Goering in March to organize 200,000 secret police, ostensibly to prevent conspiracies outside the party, but in fact to prevent rebellions within the party. These secret police, or as servants, or as doormen, or as post office clerks, or as telephone operators, in various forms, were all available. Therefore, once there was an alarm, Hitler would know. The safe suppression of this incident also depended entirely on these secret police. It can be seen that Hitler's defense against the left-wing rebellion was already well-planned.</p>
<p>Hitler's expectation was to make Germany a country without parties or factions. Although the revolution of the National Socialist Party had eliminated the enemy parties, it had not changed the social organization. The social hierarchy was no different from other capitalist countries. Due to the different interests of the classes, there were different political views, and due to the different political views, left- and right-leaning movements were formed. These signs can be seen in two aspects: (1) the figures in the Hitler government, and (2) the group forces. The government figures belonging to the right wing are Foreign Minister Neurath, Finance Minister Krosigk, National Bank Governor Schacht, and Minister of Economic Affairs Schmitt. Before Hitler came to power, his attitude was unbiased, but in the past year, he has gradually leaned to the right. As of today, it is safe to include him in this group. Those belonging to the left wing are Minister of Education Rust, Minister without Portfolio and leader of the Guard Troop Roehm, and Minister of Food Walter Dame. In addition, Minister of the Interior Frick, who was neither left nor right before, has now turned to the right.</p>
<p>As for the group forces, the division is as follows: There are currently six types of group forces in Germany: (1) the National Defense Army, (2) the police, (3) the secret police, (4) the Black Shirts, (5) the Steel Helmet League, and (6) the Storm Troopers. Of these six groups, the first five are all right-wing forces, while the Storm Troopers have a large number of left-leaning members, so they can be regarded as left-wing forces. Let's describe their strength separately. Although the National Defense Army has only 100,000 people, the length of service is as long as twelve years, so the training they receive is the most sufficient in Europe. In addition, the number of people is small, and the equipment is excellent, so in terms of combat effectiveness, they are much better than the soldiers of other European countries. Before Hindenburg's death, this group often followed Hindenburg's will. Hindenburg himself often took a detached attitude towards politics, so the National Defense Army did not participate in many coups. However, in the final analysis, it is the backbone of the right wing. As for the German police, there are 150,000 people. Although the Treaty of Versailles stipulates that they should not receive combat training, it is an open secret that they have received combat training. Prussia accounts for the majority of these police. Goering, in his capacity as the Minister of the Interior of Prussia, has the power to command the Prussian police, so this force can be said to be entirely in the hands of Hitler and Goering, becoming a force of the right wing. Not to mention the 200,000 secret police organized by Goering. As for the Black Shirts, they are Hitler's specially selected loyal followers from the Storm Troopers. Although the number is only a few thousand, they are Hitler's most trusted team. As for the Steel Helmet League, it was originally an organization of veterans. Before Hitler came to power, there were one million people. Initially, Hugenberg was the leader, but now it is the soda industry entrepreneur Fraz Seldte. After Hitler took office as Prime Minister, he contacted and specially appointed Selde as Minister of Labor. Although the people in this group have experienced the Great War, they are all middle-aged, so their thinking is very stable, which is very different from those who are young and frivolous. Therefore, it is also a major force of the right wing. Finally, the Storm Troopers were created by Hitler himself. The members are mostly young people with youthful spirits. Demonstrations and slogans are their specialty. Before Hitler came to power, they fought with the Communist Party. After taking office, they attacked the organs of the Communist Party, mostly by the power of the Storm Troopers. Since the Hitler Party gained power in March of last year, the Communist Party and the Socialist Party have been suppressed by Hitler, and many have changed their party affiliation and joined them. The purpose was to make the Storm Troopers lean to the left, so as to achieve their goals. Before the June 30th incident, the number of people in this group had increased to 2.5 million. Although their combat capabilities are far below the National Defense Army and the police, their strength cannot be ignored due to their large number.</p>
<p>Now that the six major groups have been clarified, it is not difficult to see the inside story of this incident. Since the class hierarchy has not been changed under Hitler's rule, the left- and right-leaning of political figures and political groups is inevitable. Since the various group forces have different left and right, conflicts are inevitable. Since this spring, these conflicts have been common. One is the conflict between the Storm Troopers and the Steel Helmet League, and the other is the conflict between the Storm Troopers and the National Defense Army. The initiator is indeed Roehm, the leader of the Storm Troopers. Roehm saw that the members of the Storm Troopers were increasingly leaning to the left, and he wanted to use this trend to replace Hitler. In order to achieve this goal, he naturally started by annexing the Steel Helmet League and the National Defense Army, which were regarded as the strongholds of the right wing. In March of this year, Roehm carried out his plan to annex the Steel Helmet League. He first requested Hitler to order the Steel Helmet League to be incorporated into the Storm Troopers of the National Socialist Party based on the principle of a non-party, non-faction, and nationally integrated nation. Hitler thought that he could expand his power, so he was happy to accept it. However, due to the resistance of the right wing, he adopted a compromise method, changing the name of the Steel Helmet League to the United Corps of Veterans of the National Socialist Party. It was nominally the National Socialist Party, but in fact it still existed independently. Since then, the Storm Troopers and the Steel Helmet League have been at odds with each other, and conflicts have occurred frequently. On June 11th, after the leader of the Steel Helmet League, the current Minister of Labor Selde, gave a speech to the Steel Helmet League, the car he was riding in was stoned and madly insulted by the Storm Troopers. Selde told Hitler about this, and Hitler was very unhappy. Afterwards, Roehm asked Hitler to disband the Steel Helmet League, or to make the Steel Helmet League fully subject to the command of the National Socialist Party. His attitude was very tough. Hitler himself had already leaned to the right at this time, and he was deeply dissatisfied with the left-leaning members of the National Socialist Party. He also felt that Roehm had other ambitions, so he refused. This is one point of the conflict between the left and right wings. The second request was that Roehm allowed his subordinates to be added to the National Defense Army when the National Defense Army was expanded in the future. The British military reduction plan had allowed the German National Defense Army to expand to 200,000 to 300,000. Once this point is recognized internationally, the German National Defense Army will naturally be greatly expanded. If Roehm's plan is followed, the Storm Troopers can select members to supplement the National Army at that time. In this way, the honorary status and salary of the Storm Troopers can be increased. However, the National Defense Army strongly opposed this, because the social status and usual training of the National Defense Army are far from comparable to the Storm Troopers. Indiscriminate joining will not only hinder the discipline of the National Defense Army, but also reduce its status. Hitler was very difficult to deal with between the two forces. At the same time, because he was dissatisfied with the left-leaning of the Storm Troopers, he was willing to compromise with the opinions of the National Defense Army and cut back on the team he had created. The steps he took were to replace Roehm and to reduce the Storm Troopers. The two orders issued by Hitler in early June were the first steps in his predetermined plan. These two orders were: (1) Roehm was given a month's leave due to physical indisposition, and he was allowed to go to Dalmating to recuperate; (2) The Storm Troopers were given a month's vacation. During the vacation, they were not allowed to wear uniforms or hold meetings and parades. The intention of these two orders was very obvious in resolving Roehm's power. Therefore, Roehm had no choice but to obey the order and go to Dalmating to recuperate. However, it was not long before he sneaked back to Munich and secretly plotted something wrong. Therefore, Hitler, Goering, and others knew about it, and they resolved the conspiracy of Roehm and others with lightning speed.</p>
<p>Therefore, Hitler had already understood this coup, and the prevention and response were all predetermined. Hitler's right-leaning was also fully exposed by this incident. A Reuters dispatch from Paris on the 7th of this month said, "On August 1st, the Prime Minister met with General Fei Lizi, the Chief of Staff of the National Defense Army, General Bai Longbao, the Minister of National Defense, and General Li Qinuo of the Ministry, and explained to them that only he himself, as the head of state, could save the civil war. He also said that he was prepared to make a guarantee in writing, stating that after he took the position of Marshal of the Army, he would never use his position to discriminate against the National Defense Army, and he would be responsible for weakening the socialist tendencies of the National Socialist Party and adopting the suggestions of the National Defense Army on domestic and foreign policy matters." From this, we can know Hitler's attitude. Moreover, Hitler has recently reduced the Storm Troopers from 2.5 million to 800,000, which shows that Roehm's rebellion was by no means Roehm's fault alone.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Yesterday's Rampant Autumn Sun <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Afternoon Temperature Reaches 104 Degrees</p>
<p>Two New Records for the Observatory</p>
<p>Hospital Clinics are Busy Again</p>
<p>According to the National News Agency, the climate in Shanghai this year has been marked by drought and heat. On July 12th, the extreme heat reached 104.4 degrees, setting a new record for the observatory in its 63 years. It was hoped that the weather would cool down after the start of autumn. Unexpectedly, after the highest temperature reached 100 degrees the day before yesterday, it exceeded that again yesterday, suddenly increasing to 104 degrees, only 0.4 degrees lower than the hottest day last month. Yesterday afternoon, between noon and 2:30 PM, those sitting in offices were all sweating profusely. Looking up at the sky, it was a clear blue with not a single cloud. Sunlight radiated intensely on the roads, and the rickshaw pullers and laborers were panting, their clothes soaked with sweat. According to the observatory, the highest recorded temperature in August in its 63 years was 102.9 degrees, so this year has already set two new records.</p>
<p>Due to the recent hot weather, the clinics at various epidemic hospitals have been busier. For example, the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Xizang Road is still seeing nearly 200 outpatients every day. The most common symptoms are vomiting and diarrhea, followed by dysentery and malaria. Cases of heatstroke have become rare. There were still four deaths the day before yesterday, but none yesterday. In addition, the Emergency Epidemic Hospital on Kaifeng Road sees about 60 to 70 outpatients daily, with dysentery and gastroenteritis (i.e., vomiting and diarrhea) being the most common. There were two cases of heatstroke yesterday. The number of deaths has decreased. The Hongkou Epidemic Hospital still sees 300 outpatients daily, mostly with dysentery.</p>
<p>Regarding the drought inland, according to experienced farmers, such a drought in the Jiangnan region only occurred once before, in the sixth year of the Xianfeng era, but it was not as extremely hot. They also say that in recent days, thick fog has often filled the air in the evening. According to farmers' proverbs, spring fog means rain, summer fog means heat, autumn fog means a cool breeze, and winter fog means snow. Now, there is fog in autumn, but it is extremely hot, which is said to be autumn behaving like summer, an abnormal climate. It is truly a rare climate phenomenon that has not been seen in decades.</p>
<h3 id="e117">The Severe Drought Urgently Needs Food <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Foreign Rice Orders Not Yet Complete</p>
<p>Flour Prices Skyrocket</p>
<p>According to the Daily News, due to the prolonged drought and lack of rain, rice prices have been soaring. Banks and rice merchants in Shanghai have ordered more than one million dan of foreign rice. Provinces affected by the drought are also purchasing large quantities from Shanghai. Flour prices have been rising sharply in recent days, which is also related to the drought.</p>
<p>Continuing to Order Foreign Rice According to rice industry sources yesterday, the current orders for foreign rice, placed by banks and rice merchants, are motivated by the desire to regulate the food supply for the people. The amount, reported to be over one million dan, is indeed accurate. Recently, there have been many provinces coming to Shanghai to purchase rice, and local sales are also brisk. Prices are being set as low as possible, so current sales are only covering costs. However, the exploitation of profiteering merchants is inevitable. The Social Affairs Bureau is conducting strict investigations and registrations to prevent this. Currently, the orders placed with foreign merchants for foreign rice in the past three days total about 100,000 dan. The rice is mostly of lower quality, and the prices are about the same as before. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai at the beginning of next month.</p>
<p>Difficulty in Stabilizing Rice Prices The import of foreign rice and the domestic rice trade have not had a significant impact on the current situation. Most of the foreign rice is being sold inland, where it is truly needed. Currently, only a dozen or so rice boats from inland areas are arriving in Shanghai daily. Rice merchants' inventories are dwindling, with only a portion remaining unsold. The demand for rice is even greater after autumn as the drought intensifies, so it is quite difficult to stabilize rice prices.</p>
<p>Flour Prices Rise and Sales are Brisk In April of this year, the price of flour was only 1.25 yuan per bag, which was below cost. At that time, manufacturers reported significant losses and requested government assistance. Since the start of the drought, market prices have risen continuously. Recently, they have skyrocketed from 1.90 yuan to 2.70 yuan per bag. Due to large-scale purchases by banks, prices have continued to soar. Daily transactions have remained above one million bags. Flour mills have also significantly increased their output.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Disaster Relief Meeting</p>
<p>A Resolution to Request One Million Yuan in Public Bonds from the Provincial Government for Relief</p>
<p>In addition to Fundraising, Warehouses Will be Allocated for Loans First</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province is suffering from a severe drought this year, especially Haining County. Fellow countrymen from Haining in Shanghai held a meeting at the Silk Cocoon Guild yesterday afternoon at 3 PM to discuss disaster relief. They resolved to request one million yuan in relief from the provincial government. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees The following Haining natives attended the meeting: Jiang Huiyue, Wang Peisan, Shen Mianfu, Huang Yiqin, Wu Wanli, Wang Jinsheng, Xu Xingbin, Xu Shenru, Zheng Peiheng, Gu Dayi, Zhan Yongquan, Ju Yihong, Wang Weigeng, Yan E'sheng, Yu Kuangluo, Xu Shaojiu, Shi Shaochu, Wang Xufu, Wang Luhua, Hua Liting, Chen Gengyu, Zha Zhongjian, Zhang Zhengxue, Xu Yongzuo, Shen Huachen, and more than sixty others.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report Chairman Xu Shenru reported that after the disaster relief fundraising in the 21st year of the Republic, there was a surplus of 28,500 yuan, which was handed over to the Renshen Relief Surplus Management Committee. By this year, with interest, the total amount is just under 30,000 yuan. This year, Gengning County has had no rain during the plum rain season, and there has been a severe drought in summer and autumn, leading to withered crops and no secondary products. There is no hope for the autumn harvest, and the people's livelihood is in dire straits. There is no one to turn to for help. Shenru and others recently went to Beijing to petition, and the authorities agreed to provide relief, but the disaster is extremely severe, and help is urgently needed. It is now planned to first organize an emergency relief association to raise funds for industrial relief and shelters, and the previous relief surplus can also be used within the original scope to ensure that it is used appropriately.</p>
<p>Representatives' Speeches Next, County Magistrate Jiang Huiyue of the county said that since the beginning of summer this year, there has not been a drop of rain, causing the land in Ning to crack and the rivers to dry up. The autumn harvest is hopeless, and the plight of the residents is unspeakable. I believe everyone is aware of this. Under such extreme hardship, there have been incidents of robbery of rice and grain in Changan, Xiashi, and Yuanhua. For the sake of security, the government has had to impose severe punishments. Although things are calmer now, there are still hungry people waiting to be fed. If concrete relief measures are not taken first, the 360,000 people of Ning County will face certain death. However, relief is a major undertaking, and it cannot be effective without collective efforts. I hope everyone will do their duty and gather large sums of money to save the people of the entire county, etc.</p>
<p>Resolutions The following resolutions were then discussed and passed: (1) Officially appoint representatives to petition the Zhejiang Provincial Government to allocate one million yuan in public bonds for relief. (2) County warehouses and district warehouses should all first provide loans. A letter should be sent by the county government to the Department of Civil Affairs, starting with investigating the poorest households. (3) District grain reserves should be instructed to be lent out locally, and a letter should be sent to the county government to order each district to do so. (4) Several nursing homes should be established for widows, widowers, orphans, and the disabled, and they should be accommodated as much as possible. The funds should be allocated from the Renshen relief surplus. (5) The method for further fundraising in various places will be discussed after the amounts have been obtained.</p>
<p>Nomination of Committee Members The following committee members were then nominated: Shen Mianfu, Shi Shaochu, Zhang Xinfu, Li Yingbo, Shen Jinru, Wu Xinmu, Shen Shuying, Li Hongxiang, Wu Yugeng, Zhu Zemin, Huang Yiqin, Zha Zhongqian, Feng Liutang, Wang Jinsheng, Xu Tiru, Zhu Linzun, Wang Peisan, Yang Xuemen, Gu Dayi, Yu Kuangluo, Zhu Rongtang, Xu Xingbin, Tang Yongfu, Xu Shaozeng, Zhu Jun, Zhang Binren, Zhang Lengseng, Shen Zhongyue, Zhou Yuemin, Xu Shenru, Shen Huachen, Xu Yushu, Pan Gengsheng, Yao Wenfu, Xu Lingyun, Chen Yugeng, Chen Songlin, Zhou Wusan, Xu Boming, Wang Luping, Gu E'sheng, Chen Gengyu, Ye Shantao, Yang Jixin, Zhu Yanqing, Yu Wuyun, Zhang Xinchu, Gu Yigu, Zhang Xinqi, Zhu Xiaoqin, Yu Zhiqing, Hua Liting, Wang Xufu, Zhang Youyi, Ju Yihong, Wang Weigeng, and Hang Zhuoying.</p>
<p>Executive Staff Fifteen executive committee members were then mutually elected: Jiang Huiyue, Zhan Yongquan, Xu Shenru, Xu Xingbin, Zhang Binren, Shen Zhongyue, Shen Huachen, Xu Yushu, Zha Zhongjian, Zhou Wusan, Gu Dayi, Shi Shaochu, Yan E'sheng, Pan Gengsheng, and Wang Luping. The following staff members were also nominated: (1) General Affairs: Gu Dayi, Hang Zhuoying, Wu Yugeng; (2) Finance: Zhou Wusan, Ju Yihong, Wang Weigeng; (3) Supervision: Zhan Yongquan, Xu Yushu, Zha Zhongjian.</p>
<p>Report on Disaster Conditions Yesterday, County Magistrate Jiang Huiyue told a reporter from the New Sound News Agency that our county is unfortunate and has suffered repeated disasters. The silk industry has been in decline for a long time, and the coffers have long been empty. In the 21st year of the Republic, the rural economy collapsed, and the disaster became severe. There was a period of food scarcity, leading to rice looting incidents. Fellow countrymen raised funds for relief, which helped the people adjust, and the unrest subsided. This year, there has been a prolonged drought during the plum rain season, and even the grass has withered. In terms of the people's food, the crops have withered, and there is no hope for the autumn harvest. In terms of secondary products, the silk industry has declined, and both cotton and beans have failed. People's livelihoods are in dire straits, and there is no one to turn to for help. He was moved to tears when describing the disaster. Haining County has a total area of 800,000 mu and a population of 360,000. The disaster has created a scene of scorched earth. The city rivers are completely dry, and drinking water is almost exhausted. People mainly eat soybeans and wheat, and some struggle to find enough to eat all day long, leading to numerous suicides. Rice prices have soared, increasing by three yuan compared to before. The water in the Qiantang River has excessive salinity, making it useless for drinking or irrigation. The most critical issue at the moment is fire prevention. If a fire were to break out, there would be no way to extinguish it. He hopes that the central government can implement relief measures as soon as possible to restore the people's livelihoods, etc.</p>
<p>Fundraising Announcement The association also passed a fundraising announcement, which states, "Poetry echoes the chapter of the Cloud Han, 'How severe is the drought?' The people look to the rivers and lakes for moisture, hoping to avoid hunger. Our Haining, formerly Yanguan, is located in saline-alkali land. It has no large bodies of water for storage and relies solely on sluice gates to distribute small streams. It is always affected by droughts and floods. Rice is not enough for self-sufficiency, and people rely on buying rice for meals. Silk is a major secondary product, and trade in silk is essential for livelihood. Unexpectedly, sales have been sluggish for a long time, and many factories have been closed. Over the past three or four years, the few tens of millions in income have been used to address accumulated difficulties. Now, we are suffering from a severe drought. The plum rain season has been prolonged, and even the grass has withered. Incidents of rice looting are frequent, and there is no hope for relief. People are suffering from hunger and cold, and there is no one to turn to for help. Alas, pictures depict displaced people, and we cannot bear to see starving corpses in the fields. There are many virtuous people in the world who will surely donate grain from their granaries. Blessings are not in vain. Wealth is dispersed, and the people will gather. Goodness brings abundance, and sincerity will surely be rewarded. We hope that influential figures across the country and kind people from our hometown will open their hearts and wallets and contribute to the cause. Merit is like building a pagoda, and the fame and fragrance will spread throughout the humble dwellings. Respectfully announced."</p>

<p>Decision to Dredge Songjiang River</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province Collects Labor Tax, Allocates 80,000 Yuan Annually</p>
<p>Shanghai City Handles it Separately Through the Dredging Bureau and the Municipal Government</p>
<p>Regarding the method of dredging the Wusong River, the Taihu Basin Water Conservancy Committee had previously drafted a construction plan and budget, and requested the National Economic Commission to allocate funds under the cotton and wheat loan. Half a year has passed, and the allocation has not yet been approved. However, the Wusong River urgently needs dredging and cannot be delayed any longer. It is now heard that the dredging method has been separately agreed upon by the Ministry of Interior, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and the Shanghai Municipal Government. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Provincial and Municipal Division of Dredging According to the New Sound News Agency in Beijing, it has now been decided that the dredging of the Wusong River will be undertaken separately by the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Shanghai Municipal Government. The section within the jurisdiction of Jiangsu Province, from Guajingkou in the upper reaches of the Wusong River to Laopanlonggang, which is the upper reaches of the river, will be the responsibility of the Jiangsu Provincial Government. The labor tax collection method will be adopted, similar to the Liutang River project, and it will be completed in three phases. The funds required cannot be obtained by clearing the previous Wusong River dredging mu tax, so 80,000 yuan will have to be allocated annually from the road construction surtax in eight counties to cover it. The section within the Shanghai city area, from Laopanlonggang in the lower reaches to the outlet, which is the lower reaches of the river, will be handled separately by the Municipal Government, except for the two sites of Yujidun and Fanwangdu, where the straightening of bends will be arranged by the Municipal Government. The rest will be continued to be contracted by the Dredging Bureau through the Municipal Government.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Measures It is also reported from Shanghai that the Municipal Government estimates that the labor costs required for the straightening of bends at the two sites of Yujidun and Fanwangdu will be approximately 200,000 yuan. In addition to the 50,000 yuan allocated by the Municipal Government, the remaining 150,000 yuan will be raised by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce in conjunction with the Shipping Association and the Inland River Steamboat Industry Association. The Municipal Government Secretariat has issued a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to handle this matter.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce's Response The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has stated that the Wusong River within the city area, from Xinzha Bridge to the Outer Baidu Bridge outlet, was dredged by the former Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, which was responsible for fundraising, as early as the 13th year of the Republic. However, due to a shortage of funds and the large scale of the project, it was difficult to complete. The mu tax from various counties has not been allocated as scheduled, and the outstanding amount has been borrowed by the Chamber of Commerce. As of now, the principal and interest owed amount to more than 170,000 yuan, which has not been repaid and is a heavy burden. If the aforementioned outstanding amount can be allocated in full, the Chamber of Commerce can consider donating some funds to help with the project. However, in these times of economic downturn, it is truly difficult to raise funds from various industries.</p>

<p>Another Food Meeting</p>
<p>Re-limiting Rice Prices</p>
<p>Discussing Grain Storage to Prevent Famine</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, although the government has imposed price limits and taken steps to regulate the price of rice since it soared, it has been difficult to see results recently. According to a spokesperson for the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to a reporter from the Central News Agency, the rice harvest is poor in various places, and rice prices are likely to continue to rise. The previous limit of 13 yuan has been exceeded in practice. Therefore, the bureau will convene another meeting of the Food Committee at Cuixiu Hall at 4 PM on the 28th to re-determine rice price limits and discuss grain storage for famine prevention. As for the report that the central government will allocate 4 million yuan to build grain storage facilities in Shanghai and other places and limit the completion within a year, the bureau has not heard of it.</p>

<p>Came to Shanghai for Medical Treatment Yesterday and Returned to Nanjing in the Evening</p>
<p>Examination Results Showed a Threefold Increase in Diabetic Components</p>
<p>Wang Plans to Visit Jiangxi Again Next Week to Discuss Everything</p>
<p>President of the Executive Yuan Wang Jingwei left Nanjing by night train the night before last and arrived at Zhenru at 7:20 AM yesterday, where he switched to a car and went straight to his private residence on Pushi Road to rest. Wang came here solely for medical treatment and has no other tasks. He is scheduled to visit Lushan again next week to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to discuss important matters. Wang returned to Nanjing by night train last night to preside over the joint central government and national government Confucius birthday celebration tomorrow.</p>
<p>Medical Examination After arriving in Shanghai, Wang summoned Dr. Noel, a German doctor, from Beijing at around 8 AM yesterday morning to examine his body. The examination lasted about an hour. Wang's blood and other samples were then sent to Dr. Zhao Fuke's medical laboratory, a Russian doctor, for analysis. Yesterday afternoon, the analysis results showed that the diabetic components had suddenly increased to more than three times the normal level. Dr. Noel advised him to continue taking the new medicine and to get special rest and careful treatment.</p>
<p>Wang's Remarks When this newspaper's reporter met Wang last night, he said that today's (i.e., yesterday's) examination results showed that his diabetic components had suddenly increased by more than three times. The doctor said that it was caused by excessive labor during the summer and insufficient rest. When the reporter asked whether President Wang would visit Lushan again next week to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Wang replied that he could not make a decision at the moment due to his health. However, according to reliable sources, Wang is indeed planning to go to Jiangxi around the 28th.</p>

<p>A Supervision Committee on Usage Will Also Be Formed</p>
<p>According to the New Sound News Agency, the Ministry of Railways has borrowed 30 million yuan from banks to reorganize the Pinghan Railway. After negotiations between Minister of Railways Gu Mengyu and Zhou Zuomin, the General Manager of Jin Cheng Bank and representative of the banking industry, an agreement has been reached and a contract has been signed in Beiping, using the Pinghan Railway's real estate in Hankou as collateral. The borrowing banks have formed a syndicate to handle it. Zhou Zuomin, who signed the cooperation agreement, is the chief representative of the syndicate.</p>
<p>Establishment of a Supervisory Committee The uses of the loan for the Pinghan Railway are: (1) Rebuilding the Yellow River Railway Bridge; (2) Reorganizing the entire line of tracks; (3) Replenishing equipment for the entire line's factories, etc. It has also been decided that the syndicate formed by the borrowing banks, the Ministry of Railways, and representatives appointed by the Pinghan Railway will form a Supervisory Committee on Usage to demonstrate good faith.</p>
<p>Zhou Will Return to Shanghai Zhou Zuomin, the General Manager of Jin Cheng Bank, had contacted various banks in Shanghai to subscribe to the Pinghan Railway loan.

<p>Japanese Side Says it is Unrelated to the Current Situation</p>
<p>According to the Continental News, it was rumored yesterday (the 24th) that the flagship of the Far East American Fleet, the USS Augusta, and two destroyers were ordered to come to Shanghai from Qingdao and would arrive today. Last night, American personnel in Shanghai claimed that they were unaware of this. In general, naval circles notify each other of the movements of warships, but the naval circles in Shanghai also denied receiving any news of American warship movements. As for the report that 30 Japanese warships had sailed to Dalian and 70 bombers had flown to Harbin, Japanese personnel acknowledged that it was true, but said that this deployment had been announced weeks ago and was part of the Japanese navy's autumn exercises and had nothing to do with the current situation between Russia and Japan.</p>

<p>Resolution of the Sailor Issue</p>
<p>No Dutch Sailors Hired</p>
<p>Decision to Use Domestic Sailors</p>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company borrowed from the British Boxer Indemnity Fund to build four seagoing vessels in the UK. In another month and a half, the first vessel, Haiyuan, will arrive in Shanghai. Haiheng will also arrive soon after. With the start of operations approaching, the issue of hiring sailors, including Dutch sailors and domestic sailors, has arisen. The issue has now been resolved through a meeting, and it has been approved to use domestic sailors. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Dutch Envoy's Recommendation The Dutch shipowner, Boerger &amp; Flower, stopped operation due to poor business, the Dutch ambassador stationed in China had recommended to China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to sell their ship to them, but was denied. The ambassador had also reached out and recommended their sailors to the new ships, Mr. Liu Hongsheng, the General Manager, showed his intention to cooperate.</p>
<p>Company Meeting Decision Liu then submitted the issue to the company meeting to gather opinions. On Monday, he convened the heads of the shipping, sales, and general affairs departments to discuss the matter publicly. The chief shipowner, Shen Jiyun, also attended. As a result of the on-the-spot consultation, it was decided that the four vessels would mainly use domestic sailors. If Dutch sailors were used, there might be incompatibility issues. As a result, it was decided to use domestic sailors. The company has now replied to the Dutch envoy, politely declining the offer.</p>

<p>Lin Cangsong is Expelled</p>
<p>Heartbreak Over the National Crisis Leads to the Authorities' Anger</p>
<p>Detained for Three Months and then Repatriated</p>
<p>According to the National News Agency, overseas Chinese are increasingly subjected to harsh oppression by local governments and natives. They dare to be angry but dare not speak out. The status of overseas Chinese is no longer what it used to be. This is due to the weakness of the country and the lack of effective solutions from the authorities, so they are often left to fate. Yesterday, Mr. Lin Cangsong, an overseas Chinese residing in Singapore, was even detained for three months and then repatriated for his heartbreak over the national crisis, which aroused the anger of the authorities. When the reporter met Mr. Lin at his residence yesterday and asked about the expulsion, he couldn't help but sob repeatedly. According to Mr. Lin, he was an overseas student in Singapore, British Malaya, and graduated from the local Chinese High School. However, due to his poor family circumstances, he had to drop out of school and take a job at the Dao Nan Primary School, which was run by Fujianese in Singapore. After the September 18th Incident in Shenyang, the rich three northeastern provinces were forcibly occupied by the violent Japanese. He was extremely indignant. Thinking that every citizen is responsible for the rise and fall of the country, he could not rush to the battlefield, but he should still fulfill his national obligations. Therefore, he often wrote articles in newspapers to awaken his fellow overseas Chinese and jointly save the situation. Unexpectedly, this aroused the anger of the local government, which labeled him a radical and arrested him, detaining him for three months and then deporting him. He suffered this humiliation and felt grief and anger. He had no choice but to return to China quietly. Moreover, before he was expelled, all his clothes were searched and taken away. After arriving in Shanghai, he had almost nothing to support himself. Fortunately, the socialite Mr. Huang Jingwan generously donated money to send him back to his hometown. This kindness and virtue are indeed touching. However, he is determined to have a day to serve his country and hopes that his compatriots in the motherland will work hard to prevent the extinction of the Chinese race.</p>

<p>The Guangxi Provincial Government, believing that the province is rich in mineral resources and urgently needs development, sent a telegram to the Shanghai banking industry, requesting them to send personnel to investigate and invest in construction. The Bank Association appointed Mr. Jin Guobao, Deputy General Manager of the Bank of Communications, to inspect the situation. After Mr. Jin returned to Shanghai, he believed that Guangxi was indeed rich in mineral resources and that development was necessary, and he strongly encouraged the banking industry to invest. Various parties have expressed consensus. After Mr. Jin returns from the Economic Annual Conference, he will visit Guilin again, and the amount of capital will be decided.</p>

<p>Wen Yuqing, Director of the International Telegraph Administration, left Shanghai last week to inspect the international telegraph situation in other cities. He returned to Shanghai yesterday after completing his official duties and is scheduled to report to the Bureau tomorrow. According to the Bureau's statistics, there are more than fifty privately owned radio stations in Shanghai, and applications to establish new stations are still pouring in. The allocation of frequencies is quite difficult. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications has specifically ordered the Bureau to stop issuing permits for the installation of radio stations in Shanghai from now on.</p>

<p>Qiu Jicai Discusses Silver Price Fluctuations</p>
<p>Our Country's Silver is Bound to Continue Flowing Out</p>
<p>The Relationship Between Silver Price Fluctuations and the Great War</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, since the US government raised the price of silver and nationalized silver holdings, our country's silver exports have reached over 100 million yuan. This matter is of great importance to the national economy and social finance. The Ministry of Finance has now hired experts to study countermeasures. A Central News Agency reporter inquired with Mr. Qiu Jicai, who is familiar with financial matters, and he said the following:</p>
<p>Large-Scale Silver Outflow from Our Country: The fluctuation of silver prices in London differs little from the market price in Shanghai. Normally, the difference is only one-sixteenth of a penny. This time, due to the US government buying silver and raising its price, the difference between the two places has reached a significant two pence. As a result, our country's large-scale silver exports have reached 100 million. It is predicted that a large amount of silver will continue to flow out, because the difference in silver prices between the two places is so great that those seeking profit will definitely continue to transport it, so that with one turn of the hand, profits will accumulate. This can be asserted.</p>
<p>Reasons for the US to Raise Silver Prices: The US government's raising of silver prices and buying of silver will inevitably lead anyone to speculate on its intentions. It is preparing for a second world war. Although the outcome of modern warfare ostensibly depends on the sharpness of firearms, it actually depends on economic power. Silver is more versatile than gold, and silver is more useful during wartime than in peacetime. European countries all use gold standards. During the European War, because it was difficult to purchase goods with gold coins, silver was purchased after the outbreak of the war, causing the price of silver to rise to 90 pence at that time. The brewing of a second world war is almost like the eve of the European War, with a sense of imminent outbreak. The US authorities, in view of the usefulness of silver, which is sufficient to determine the outcome of war, are raising the price of silver and buying silver to prepare in advance. This is common knowledge to discerning people, and silver-using countries in the Far East, such as our country, are exporting large quantities.</p>
<p>The Relationship Between Silver Price Fluctuations is Extremely Important: He continued, the level of silver prices is of great importance to the whole world and cannot be viewed as merely a matter of commercial conditions. Therefore, the current US increase in silver prices and buying of silver is no different from the silver price increase during the European War. Observing the outbreak of the European War in 1914, the belligerent countries, not knowing the importance of silver, collected cash from each other, causing the price of silver to fall to 22 and one-eighth pence. After the start of the war, they realized the relationship between silver and war, and the price of silver gradually soared to 90 pence one year after the armistice. From this, we can further believe in the intention of raising the price of silver and buying silver. Mr. Qiu also listed the following facts about the relationship between silver price fluctuations and the reasons for changes:</p>
<p>Year Highest Price (Pence) Lowest Price (Pence) Reason</p>
<p>1897 29.13 23.12 Japan adopts the gold standard, Greco-Turkish War</p>
<p>1900 30.13 27. Chinese Boxer Rebellion, South African War, India large minting of Rupees</p>
<p>1902 26.2 21.1 Silver market falls sharply, end of South African War, unstable Chinese trade due to unresolved Boxer indemnities</p>
<p>1904 28.9 24.7 Russo-Japanese War, Mexican currency reform, Indian silver purchases</p>
<p>1906 33.2 29. India large purchases of silver coins, US government begins buying silver</p>
<p>1907 32.7 24.3 India stops buying silver, silver prices fall sharply, US panic, Bank of England interest rates raised to 7%</p>
<p>1911 26.2 23.2 Strikes in the United States, Chinese Revolution</p>
<p>1913 29.6 26.2 Establishment of Chinese foreign debt of 25 million pounds, India buys 5.5 million pounds of silver</p>
<p>1914 27.12 22.2 Outbreak of the Great War, major changes in financial and stock markets, Britain large minting of silver coins</p>
<p>1917 55. 35.11 Continuation of the European War, countries minting silver coins, silver market soared, to 90 pence one year after the armistice</p>

<p>Although Shaanxi Province is Drought-Stricken, the Impact on Cotton is Relatively Small</p>
<p>The Cotton Control Committee, because banking circles in Shanghai had invested in Shaanxi to develop the cotton industry, specially dispatched Standing Committee member Zou Bingwen to Shaanxi's cotton-producing areas last month for a detailed investigation to provide reference for the committee. It is now known that Mr. Zou has completed his official duties and returned south, arriving in Shanghai yesterday. He said that although Shaanxi Province is also experiencing drought, the impact on most cotton-producing areas is relatively small, so the impression of this trip is still good. He also said that after a short rest, he will begin to organize the report.</p>

<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau has decided to start collecting the second installment of the provisional land value tax for Maps 1 to 7 in the Hunan District of Shanghai and Maps 1 and 2 in the Zhabei District from September 1st. Yesterday, it notified all business owners to pay within two months. Land in the Nanshi area should be paid to the Shanghai Hunan Tax Collection Office at Maojia Lane, and land in the Beishi area should be paid to the Shanghai Hubei Tax Collection Office on Datong Road. If payment is not made by the deadline, according to Article 8 of the Provisional Land Value Tax Collection Regulations and Article 23 of the Implementation Rules, the case will be pursued, and annual interest will be added, revenue from the land will be extracted, and the land will be auctioned off as compensation.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Cotton Association Submits Document to the Yuan, Departments, and Committees <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>To Change the Standards for Eliminating Moisture and Impurities in Cotton</p>
<p>The Chinese Cotton Industry Association submitted a document to the Central Political Committee, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Industry, and the Cotton Control Committee, stating that the association's members are all cotton merchants in our country and have close ties with the production and sales of Chinese cotton. They have always tried their best to support improvement matters. However, it seems that careful consideration and overall planning should be made in advance before implementing reforms. Once implemented, they can be carried out unimpeded. The promulgation of the Regulations on Eliminating Water and Impurities in Cotton shows the government's determination to improve, and the association welcomes it without hesitation. However, after examining the articles and the actual situation in various places, there are slight differences. For the sake of the safety and future of all cotton merchants, the association cannot remain silent and offers its humble opinions, hoping that they will be examined separately to reassure businesses. Article 2 of the Regulations on Eliminating Water and Impurities in Cotton states, "The maximum limit for moisture content in domestic cotton sold on the market is 13%." Cotton material is fluffy and easily absorbs moisture. According to the regulations, this may be suitable for dry cotton-producing areas in the northern plateau, but the climate in the south is humid. In the cotton-producing areas of the southern provinces, such as south of the Yellow River and the Yangtze River Basin, the natural moisture content will inevitably be above 13% for several months during the new cotton production season. Then, due to climate and geographical reasons, the natural moisture content is beyond human control and cannot actually meet the requirements of these regulations. What kind of grievances will merchants and people suffer if they are subject to legal restrictions or criminal penalties as a result? Therefore, it is requested to make slight changes. It is proposed that from the beginning of the new cotton production season to the end of December of this year, the maximum limit be temporarily set at 14%. This is the first request. Furthermore, Article 8 of the same regulations states, "For cotton sold on a forward or spot basis, if the cottonseeds and other impurities exceed the standards of both parties or the publicly set standards by more than 0.05%, the sale and use of the cotton should be stopped." In addition to cottonseeds, the so-called impurities include cottonseed, seed flowers, broken leaves, and sand. These also resemble natural impurities. Because the cotton gins used in our country are different from those in the United States and India, it is inevitable that cottonseeds will jump in during ginning. As for cottonseed, broken leaves, and sand, it is impossible to extract them completely due to work and time constraints. This is also a fact. For the convenience of both buyers and sellers, it is proposed that the total weight of Chinese cotton containing cottonseed, seed flowers, broken leaves, and sand be temporarily set at 0.05% as the legal standard, with no increase or deduction, and 2% as the "publicly set standard." Cotton containing cottonseed, seed flowers, broken leaves, and sand exceeding 0.05% up to 2% will be deducted, and cotton exceeding the publicly set standard should be stopped from sale and use. In addition to the above items, any other kind of false quality should be strictly prohibited. Once discovered, it should be regarded as unqualified. This is the second request. Furthermore, the association has further requests. The regulations on impurity inspection methods have not yet been specified. Whether the inspection procedures apply technical scientific methods and how they will be handled should be announced for compliance. In short, the principle of eliminating water and impurities in cotton is welcomed by cotton merchants. However, there are difficulties in some aspects, and the actual difficulties must be truthfully presented for slight changes to be made, so as to achieve the effect of eliminating fraud, relieve the cotton merchants' difficulties, and whether it is feasible. This matter is hereby submitted for review, and it is hoped that it will be accepted with understanding, which would be a great kindness.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Xiamen Chamber of Commerce <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Requests Release of Detained Zhang Rice by Telegram</p>
<p>Xiamen telegram, Shen Bao forwards to all administrative agencies and people's organizations for your consideration: According to the Shanghai rice merchants from Xiamen, the tens of thousands of bags of Zhang rice applied for by our group are definitely domestic rice and have been inspected and released by the Xiamen Customs. However, some people in Shanghai are creating an atmosphere, saying that Japanese rice is being used as a substitute, hoping to monopolize and hoard, causing the Shanghai Customs to misunderstand and detain the rice. After the Xiamen Customs Commissioner and the Shima Chamber of Commerce of Xiamen Chamber of Commerce telegraphed and declared proof one after another, the Shanghai Customs also hired specialists to inspect and verify that it was pure Zhang rice. However, those with ulterior motives are still obstructing in secret, spreading rumors and making slanderous statements, saying that Japanese rice is being used as a substitute for Zhang rice, transported from Taiwan to Xiamen and then to Shanghai to avoid paying taxes, and that the rice supply in Fujian province is insufficient and Zhang rice has never been transported to Shanghai, so it must be Japanese rice being used as a substitute. Upon inspection, Xiamen has no Japanese rice imports, and Xiamen Customs has strict smuggling prevention. How can Japanese rice fly over here? Zhang rice had a bumper harvest this year, and Jiangnan had a drought and a bad harvest. It is true that Xiamen rice merchants are transporting rice to Shanghai, although it is a pioneering effort, it is a real situation. It is common for Shanghai rice to be transported to various provinces in South China, but for the past few months, it has had to rely on foreign rice. This is proof that abundance and scarcity are different. Moreover, Zhang rice and Japanese rice have different properties and can be easily distinguished, but now rumors are spreading from nowhere, with no factual basis, which is obviously someone being jealous and coming up with this malicious plan. Currently, the Zhang rice is still being detained by the Shanghai Customs, and it is required to pay six yuan per bag as a deposit. I am sincerely afraid that the rice will rot after a long time and the loss will be unbearable. Such destruction of commerce and disruption of agricultural transportation is truly infuriating. Please telegram the various agencies and organizations in Shanghai to uphold justice, and forward a request to the Jianghai Customs to release the rice quickly, so as to maintain agricultural transportation, etc. It is combined into an urgent telegram. We request you to implement it as a gesture of gratitude, Xiamen Chamber of Commerce and Shanghai Rice Merchant Association, respectfully.</p>

<p>In Order to Promote Domestic Products and Support Rural Areas</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways previously reduced freight charges for eggs (fresh or pickled, originally listed as third class) and egg yolk and egg white (dry, packed in boxes, originally listed as second class, wet, packed in barrels, originally listed as third class) by one class, in order to promote domestic products and support rural areas. Both routes have been implemented since May 5th of this year, and a three-month trial was based on the ministry's orders, which expired on August 5th. Now, the Ministry of Railways, based on the report from the Pinghan Railway that the egg industry is not thriving, has requested that the reduced fee for egg products be extended. It has specially ordered all routes to approve the extension for three months to benefit road merchants. The bureau has complied with this since the date of expiration.</p>

<p>The Municipal Party Department Requests the Installation of Guard Posts and Streetlights</p>
<p>Repeatedly Harassed by Bandits While Walking at Night</p>
<p>Such Equipment Cannot Be Delayed</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Party Department, noting that the Bailianjing area of Pudong has become increasingly prosperous in recent times, but there are no guard posts or streetlights, specially wrote to the Municipal Government yesterday to instruct the Public Security Bureau and the Public Works Bureau to handle this matter. The original letter is recorded below: "Respectfully, we received a report from the Fifth District Executive Committee of our association, stating that the Second Branch of our district reported that the Hedong area of Bailianjing, Pudong, was originally a remote area, but since factories and warehouses have sprung up, the market has become increasingly prosperous, and the population has increased without end. However, there is still a lack of road facilities, such as streetlights, which are the most urgent need at present. It is now found that the roads from Bailianjing to Xinma Road and Liuli Bridge are all important thoroughfares, but they become a dark world at night, so that the public is often harmed by bandits and petty thieves. Recently, a Mr. Chen was kidnapped due to the darkness on the road, which allowed the bandits to escape. The construction of an alcohol factory has recently begun, and the area is even more lively, and the population is becoming more and more complex, with good and bad people difficult to distinguish. If equipment is not installed early, walking at night may result in bandit attacks. Therefore, detailed drawings of the street lighting routes have been prepared and submitted to your association for review, requesting that they be forwarded to the municipal government, ordering the Public Works Bureau and the Public Security Bureau to send personnel to survey the location, install streetlights, and add police officers to ensure public safety and avoid the increasingly fierce bandit atmosphere. Based on this, the application of the branch to install streetlights and add posts in the Hedong area of Bailianjing, Pudong, are important facilities for local security and are truly urgently needed. Based on the aforementioned situation, we have enclosed the route map and respectfully submit it to your association for review, and ask that you forward it to the municipal government, ordering the Public Works Bureau and the Public Security Bureau to handle it as soon as possible, so as to facilitate transportation and maintain security, which would be beneficial to the public. The attached route map is enclosed. Based on this, the corresponding original document is enclosed for your review and handling. Sincerely, Shanghai Municipal Government."</p>

<p>Establishing Warehouses in Kunshan to Economically Assist Farmers</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Ningbo Industrial Bank has adhered to the principles of its founders, focusing on supporting industry. It specializes in providing industrial, commercial, and various fisheries mortgage loans, as well as domestic goods circulation mortgage loans. Later, with the development of its business, it added branches in Ningbo and Shenjiamen, specializing in using economic power to support the fishing industry, such as providing loans to fishermen, fishery remittances, and other businesses, which have greatly developed the fishing industry and achieved remarkable results. The fishermen in the area have all benefited from it. Fishing season loans are repaid in full when due, benefiting both the bank and the fishermen. The Shanghai head office specializes in factory goods mortgage loans and domestic goods circulation mortgage loans, which have helped industrial development and promoted domestic goods sales. It also connects with related industries to economically support foreign trade, so that domestic goods can participate in the Chicago Exposition. This year, a branch was added in Suzhou, and Mr. Wu Songlu, a senior banker, was hired to manage everything, and the business has also developed deeply. Recently, two warehouses have been established in Kunshan to first handle mortgage loans for farmers. After achieving success, other businesses will be expanded.

<p>According to the Central News Agency, Mr. Tao Xiaoliu of Nanchang, whose given name was Mu and also known as Bosun, was famous for his poetry in the Southern Society at the end of the Qing Dynasty. He traveled around all his life and had many friends at home and abroad. Some years ago, when Ye Chucang and Hu Puan took charge of the Jiangsu government, he once served as the magistrate of Nanhui, Taicang, and other counties, and was known for his integrity wherever he went. To this day, people in the counties still praise him. His family environment was extremely tragic throughout his life. After his wife died in middle age, he never remarried. His only son and daughter also passed away one after another. Alone, he only relied on his son-in-law for support. After the January 28th Incident, he declined officialdom and retired to Suzhou, living a simple and poor life, spending these tragic remaining years. Unexpectedly, this summer he contracted a minor illness and sought medical treatment, but it was ineffective. He eventually died on July 30th at No. 25 Jinshi Lane, Suzhou. After his death, his relatives could not be contacted. Only his son-in-law, Feng Yangru, took care of the funeral arrangements. The funeral will be held on September 2nd and he will be temporarily placed in the Changshan Bureau to await burial in Jiangxi. He left behind many poems and lyrics, which will also be compiled and published by his son-in-law.</p>

<p>Andree &amp; Company is the largest foreign firm at sea, which is well known. Mr. Harlow, the Western manager of the company's automobile division, has profound knowledge and rich experience in automobiles. The cars and trucks produced by General Motors, managed by him, have a very good reputation throughout China. Recently, the Hangzhou Highway Bureau, because the highways it built have gradually been completed, specially ordered ten Chevrolet cars and thirty Bedford trucks from the company. After trying them out, they were very satisfied, and they ordered another thirty Chevrolet trucks. There are still reports of additional orders, from which it can be seen that the automobiles produced by General Motors are indeed a cut above the rest, which is also due to the efforts of the company's marketing that have achieved today's results.</p>

<p>Zhang Youcai, a Ningbo native living upstairs at the Decheng Secondhand Western Clothes Store at 193 Wusong Road, Hongkou, was 40 years old this year. He was a fishmonger by trade and suffered from phlegm syncope. Recently, he received a letter from his elderly mother (83 years old), who was ill at her home in Ningbo, asking Zhang to return home to serve her. Zhang received the letter at 1 p.m. yesterday, and his wife, Mrs. Liu, accompanied him, hiring a rickshaw to the Bund wharf of the China Merchants Bureau outside the French Concession, intending to take the Xinjiangtian Steamer back to Ningbo. Unexpectedly, upon arriving at the wharf, just after getting out of the rickshaw, Zhang's phlegm disease recurred, rising and fainting on the ground. He was helped to sit in front of Warehouse No. 9, but soon died. The police saw this and reported it to the Xiaodongmen Police Station, which sent investigators to investigate. According to the regulations of the Concession, the body was ordered to be sent by vehicle to the Tongren Fuyuan Division Examination Office. Tomorrow, a request will be made to the Second Special Court to send personnel to examine the body.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Is it a Vixen Causing Trouble? <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Lawyer's Clerk Suffers a Fire</p>
<p>Police Station Takes Person in Charge to the Station for Interrogation</p>
<p>The Shikumen residence at No. 34 Xin Nong, Zhaojia Road, Dadongmen, Nanshi, was built by Liu Xiang, a local lawyer. However, Liu lived in the Concession. The residence was occupied by Liu's eldest son, Liu Meiting (25 years old). The night before last, Meiting went with his father on the night express to the Suzhou Court because he was a clerk at the lawyer's office. Only Meiting's wife and a two-month-old baby girl were living in the house. Unexpectedly, at about 1:30 a.m. yesterday morning, just as they were sleeping soundly, a fire suddenly broke out in the rice straw room for unknown reasons. In an instant, the fire was fierce and could not be controlled. Wang Rugang, the guard at post No. 4, Section 2, District 1 of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, was notified immediately and notified the fire brigades of each district. Fire trucks were quickly dispatched to the scene and made every effort to put out the fire. The fire was extinguished in about an hour. It is estimated that two rooms were burned down. According to general neighbors and tenants, the wall door of No. 24 was filled with rice straw, and no one came or went, so they usually entered and exited from the entrance of No. 28. This time, the fire in the firewood room was seen as being caused by a vixen. However, the director, Liu Yunfang, thought it was foolish talk by ignorant people and was unfounded, so he sent police to investigate. Liu's eldest daughter-in-law and others had already fled. Therefore, Liu's second son was taken to the station for interrogation.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Oil Tycoon Donates Land for Hospital <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Zhongshan Hospital Construction Begins</p>
<p>New Buildings for National Medical College Also Break Ground</p>
<p>Entire Project Scheduled for Completion in 240 Days</p>
<p>Upon Completion, It Will Be the Most Advanced and Largest Hospital in the Far East</p>
<p>American oil tycoon Rockefeller has donated 150 acres of the former baseball field for the construction of China's most advanced and largest Zhongshan Hospital. With sufficient funding raised for the entire hospital, the project has been awarded to the Kee Tai Construction Company, and construction has commenced. The completion is scheduled for 240 days. Simultaneously, the new site for the National Medical College, with a budget of 300,000 yuan allocated by the Ministry of Education, has also broken ground along with the new headquarters of the National Medical Association. Yesterday, the reporter from the Shen Shi News Agency interviewed Mr. Yan Fuqing, the person in charge of the hospital, who provided the following details:</p>
<p>Construction Begins on Zhongshan Hospital: The entire site for Zhongshan Hospital, 150 acres of the former baseball field, was voluntarily donated by the American oil tycoon. As for the construction expenses, 700,000 yuan has been raised through donations, with over 400,000 yuan already collected and the remainder expected to be collected soon. The hospital project was awarded to the Kee Tai Construction Company on the 23rd of this month, and construction has commenced. The contract stipulates completion in 240 days, with the opening ceremony scheduled for June of next year. The hospital building will be entirely Western-style, constructed entirely of steel and concrete, with an extremely grand appearance.</p>
<p>Advanced and Comprehensive Internal Facilities: Upon completion, the hospital will be the most advanced and largest in China. The initial phase of construction includes 550 beds, with the capacity to accommodate 1,000 outpatients simultaneously. Upon completion of the future expansion, the capacity can be increased to 1,000 beds. The medical departments are divided as follows: A. Department of Internal Medicine: (1) Dermatology, (2) Pediatrics, (3) Cardiology and Pulmonology, (4) Neurology, (5) Preventive Medicine; B. Department of Surgery: (1) Orthopedics, (2) Urology; C. Department of Obstetrics; D. Specialty Departments: (1) Ophthalmology, (2) Otolaryngology, (3) Gynecology; E. Obstetrics and Gynecology; F. Urology and Reproductive Medicine. In addition, special facilities include: (1) Electrotherapy Room, (2) X-ray Room, (3) Radium Therapy Room, (4) Surgical Pathology Department, (5) Laboratory, (6) Pharmacy, (7) Pathology Research Room, (8) Physiotherapy Department. The entire hospital has four floors. The first and second floors partly house the treatment rooms and offices for each department, while the remainder and the entire third floor are for patient rooms. The fourth floor is for the treatment of children's diseases.</p>
<p>Seeking Overseas Donations of Medical Equipment: Because the funds raised for the construction of the hospital are still limited, efforts are being made to solicit voluntary donations of construction materials, such as steel and concrete, as well as various internal equipment, from relevant parties, in order to achieve maximum benefit at the lowest possible cost. As for the medical equipment, valued at over 100,000 yuan, fundraising is underway overseas. Currently, those who have donated 50,000 yuan or more include Madam Song, the Jianghai Customs, the Huangpu Conservancy Board, the Bankers Association, the Money Dealers Association, and Westerners Sir Elly Rodone and Sir Victor Sasoon. Those who have donated over 1,000 yuan include Liu Hongsheng, Yan Huiqing, Zhang Xingcun, the Yokohama Specie Bank, the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Madam Liu Chen Baozhen, Huang Zhendong, Yan Lailian, the Kailan Mining Administration Sales Office, Hu Mengjia, Kong Xiangxi, Du Yuesheng, and the British American Tobacco Company.</p>
<p>New Buildings for Medical College Also Under Construction: Of the entire baseball field site, in addition to the part used for the Zhongshan Hospital site, the remaining part will be used for the construction of new buildings for the Shanghai National Medical College. Construction has also commenced simultaneously and is expected to be completed at the same time as the Zhongshan Hospital. All 300,000 yuan in construction expenses have been allocated by the Ministry of Education upon request to the Executive Yuan. After the completion of the new buildings for the Medical College, the internal divisions will include both pre-medical and medical departments. The medical department will be further divided into seven departments: Anatomy, Physiology, Pathology, Pharmacology, Biology, Chemistry, and Bacteriology and Hygiene. Zhongshan Hospital will serve as the teaching hospital.</p>
<p>Recurrent Expenses Secured: According to Mr. Yan, in addition to the recurrent expenses already allocated for the Medical College, the recurrent expenses for Zhongshan Hospital will be covered by constructing residential buildings for rent on part of the remaining land, generating an annual income of 50,000 yuan. The remaining land will be rented to build the Hong Ying Library, the Chinese Medical Association's school building, and the Shanghai Tennis Club, with the rental income serving as the hospital's endowment fund. At the same time, all future doctors at Zhongshan Hospital will be concurrently employed by the existing doctors and professors at the National Medical College, saving a significant amount of expenditure. Furthermore, the income from future consultations should also be able to sustain the hospital. If there is a shortfall, it is planned to raise funds from various parties at any time.</p>

<p>Entire Shipment Ready Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Chinese tea purchased by Soviet Russia is exclusively tea bricks. Shipments have been frequent this year. Recently, over 5,000 tons of tea bricks, worth two million yuan in national currency, have been purchased in Shanghai by the Soviet Union. Due to the urgent need for shipment, the Soviet team has dispatched a ship to China. The ship will first load over 3,000 tons in Hankou and then proceed to Shanghai to load another 2,000 tons. Loading is currently underway and is expected to be completed by tomorrow, before sailing to Vladivostok and then transferring to Moscow.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Zheng Ruyi Invents <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Scientific Building Materials</p>
<p>Recapturing Significant Interests</p>
<p>Nine out of ten building materials in our country are imported from abroad, and domestically produced ones are rare. According to Mr. Ji Zejin, Director of the Guidance Department of the International Trade Bureau, chemist Zheng Ruyi, recognizing this situation, established the Yale Manufacturing Factory three years ago, specializing in the production of various domestic building materials, hoping to recapture these interests. Currently, the output has increased to twelve types. The first two products to be launched, waterproofing paste and transparent waterproofing varnish, have eliminated the import of similar foreign goods and have had a significant impact on asphalt felt. The factory has three new products as follows:</p>
<p>Collox Oil: Cement roofs mostly use asphalt felt, which is not only expensive and labor-intensive but also black, uneven, and heavy. Collox Oil is a type of diluted chemical oil that only needs to be applied to the cement surface to penetrate and seal the micropores.</p>
<p>Waterproofing Varnish: Repairing leaking cement roofs is very difficult because cement mortar is ineffective. With the advent of waterproofing paste, this problem can be easily solved. Any type of leaking cement, tin, or asphalt felt roof or platform can be repaired with a single coat, which is very convenient.</p>
<p>Wood Preservative Oil: Wood Preservative Oil can make wood resistant to decay and durable. It can be used alone or mixed with tung oil. It is a preservative for wooden piles, boats, and building lumber. Its selling price is one-third lower than similar imported products on the market.</p>

<p>Appears to be of Mixed Japanese-American Descent, Approximately Fifteen or Sixteen Years Old</p>
<p>Disrupted Operations for a Long Time, No Place to Send Her - Feeling the Hospital System is Inadequate</p>
<p>According to the "Great American Evening Post", at around ten o'clock this morning (the 25th), a girl who appeared to be of mixed Japanese-American descent, approximately fifteen or sixteen years old, entered the American Consulate General on Jiangxi Road through the main gate. She walked into the passport room on the lower floor and shouted loudly, overturned the counter, and sent ink bottles and other objects on the counter flying in all directions. The staff were caught off guard and did not know what to do. Once they regained their composure, the girl had already flown into the adjacent shipping affairs room, shouting wildly. Before they could raise a hand, she was seized by an employee. They then began to discuss how to handle the situation. The girl calmed down slightly, but the person holding her loosened their grip for a moment, and the girl ran wildly out of the room, up the back stairs. The staff chased closely behind. The girl reached the office upstairs and shouted wildly three times, encountering the American Consul General, Mr. Kirk, by chance. She abandoned Mr. Kirk's office and went straight to the corridor connecting the American Consulate Court and the office. She passed through the court clerk's office and ran wildly into a room connected to the office of the American Assessor, Mr. Hillmer. After knocking down a clock, she escaped to the balcony outside, where she was apprehended by the court's Deputy Bailiff, Mr. Peterson. At that time, the consulate staff had already called the Public Works Department's ambulance, which transported the girl to the General Hospital. The director refused to admit her because the hospital did not have a psychiatric department, so she was sent back to the American Consulate. The consulate staff then consulted with Mr. Zhong Si, the Director-General of the Public Works Department, by telephone. They learned that the Victoria Nursing Home could treat mental illnesses, but it was full and could not accommodate her. In the end, the girl was sent to the General Police Station, to be handled by Dr. Julien, the Director of the Health Department. The American Consulate was busy with work when it was disrupted by this madwoman, causing operations to be suspended for a long time. Moreover, there was no place to send this madwoman for a while. Therefore, there was much criticism of the Public Works Department's facilities, especially the ambulance system. The driver at the time, knowing that the General Hospital did not have a psychiatric department, had no choice but to transport her to the hospital. This was not the driver's fault. Until there was no other solution, she was sent to the General Police Station, barely resolving the matter. The deficiencies in Shanghai's hospital system are truly regrettable.</p>

<p>A Young Woman is Assassinated</p>
<p>Mao Jinsheng is Highly Suspected</p>
<p>Jin Wubao, a 25-year-old woman from Pingwang, was married to Mr. Xiao Jin, a native of Shengze. However, Wubao did not abide by the traditional virtues of a married woman. Several years ago, in Shengze, she became acquainted with Mao Jinsheng, 32 years old, from Huzhou. Before long, she ran away from her husband and came to Shanghai to live with Mao in a rented room above a stove shop next to the Yuanxing Li on Yuezhou Road. At the same time, Mao Jinsheng became a driver at a silk factory, and Wubao also worked as a textile worker at a spinning mill. Their combined income was enough to provide them with a comfortable life. However, recently, Mao suddenly heard that Wubao had been engaging in illicit activities again. He questioned her about it the day before yesterday, but Wubao denied it vehemently. This led to an argument between them. In anger, Wubao stormed out of the house and went to stay temporarily with Madam Yu, the wife of Xu Yuhui, a carpenter at Tongshunxing Woodwork, No. 88 Linping Road. Yu and Wubao were close friends, so she was welcomed and given a bed in the attic. Yesterday morning, around five o'clock, Wubao got up and went downstairs to wash clothes by the water pipe. At the time, Madam Yu and her husband were still sound asleep. Suddenly, they were awakened by a scream that came from downstairs. They quickly put on their clothes and went downstairs to investigate, only to find Wubao lying on the ground, blood gushing from wounds all over her body. Her breath had stopped. Xu and others were extremely frightened and rushed to report to the Third Division of the Fifth District. The police station dispatched officers to investigate and discovered that Wubao had suffered seven knife wounds, all to vital areas. A murder weapon was found next to her body. The knife was bent, likely because the assailant used excessive force. The police immediately ordered the neighborhood head to report the case to the local court. Yesterday afternoon at three o'clock, a prosecutor was dispatched to conduct an inquest. He ordered the body to be temporarily coffined and stored, pending the arrest of the assailant. The Third Division of the Fifth District brought the murder weapon back to the station for safekeeping and summoned Xu Yuhui and Madam Yu to the station for questioning. They claimed that Mao Jinsheng was suspected of Wubao's death. Therefore, the police station ordered officers to secretly arrest him. However, Mao had already fled. The station immediately prepared a report to the General Bureau, which in turn ordered the Detective Brigade to pursue him.</p>

<p>Imported in Seven Months</p>
<p>An Increase of Over 40,000 Yuan Compared to the Same Period Last Year</p>
<p>Clear Evidence of the Ineffectiveness of the Women's National Products Year</p>
<p>According to the International Trade Bureau, the total value of perfumes and cosmetics imported from various countries since July of this year reached 1,006,140 yuan. Of this amount, 245,295 yuan was imported from France, 60,002 yuan from Germany, 148,845 yuan from the United Kingdom, 90,162 yuan from Hong Kong, 161,787 yuan from Japan, 309,119 yuan from the United States, and 2,595 yuan from other countries. This is an increase of 49,845 yuan compared to 956,295 yuan during the same period last year. The import value for July was 148,268 yuan, an increase of 4,224 yuan compared to June. At a time when international trade is declining and our country is promoting the Women's National Products Year, the import and export of various goods has decreased sharply. Only the import of perfumes and cosmetics has increased compared to last year, which is sufficient evidence of the ineffectiveness of promoting the Women's National Products Year.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Zhou Shengfa, Trafficking Red Pills <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>in North Station, Transferred to the Local Court</p>
<p>Previously Arrested Accomplices Have All Been Executed</p>
<p>Zhou Firmly Denies All Charges</p>
<p>On February 4th of this year, the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau uncovered a case of trafficking red pills at the North Railway Station, arresting Zhao Zuting and Wang Weicheng (aka Xiao Wang) and three police officers who protected and transported the drugs. They seized 2.4 million red pills. All arrested accomplices have been executed. However, Xiao Wang implicated Zhou Shengfa, residing at No. 20 Yuanyuan Li, Gordon Road, as an accomplice. Detective Lin Tianpeng of the Police Bureau, together with detectives from the Gordon Road Police Station, arrested Zhou and handed him over to the First Special Court for detention. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Tingqi continued the hearing in the Eighth Criminal Court. Zhou Shengfa hired Jiang Yiping and Fan Gang as lawyers to defend him. After the Police Station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated the case, Detective Lin presented a document containing Wang Weicheng's confession, requesting the court to prohibit the defendant's lawyers from viewing it. Lawyer Jiang immediately objected, stating that, according to the law, the defense lawyers have the right to examine evidence related to the defendant. If it is unrelated to the defendant, they can be exempted from viewing it. Attorney Zhan Jifeng, the legal advisor of the Police Bureau, also appeared in court requesting transfer, stating that according to the agreement, when inland courts transfer suspects to the concession courts, if the identity of the suspect is confirmed, they should be transferred immediately. If it is another government agency, they must also submit evidence of the crime. The Police Bureau's application to transfer the suspect Zhou Shengfa has sufficient proof of the suspect's identity and the crime. The suspect should be handed over to the officers of the Police Bureau to be taken back for investigation. Zhou Shengfa completely denied all charges, stating that he did not know Wang and Zhao and was not aware of the manufacturing of red pills and would not dare to do so. In the end, the court ruled that Zhou Shengfa should be transferred to the Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office for investigation. The evidence and files were returned in court.</p>

<p>Russian Woman Shoots French Lover</p>
<p>Due to Monetary Disputes, the Two Parties Become Irreconcilable</p>
<p>Russian Woman Arrested, French Lover Pleads on Her Behalf</p>
<p>- Russian Woman Released on 1,000 Yuan Bail, Rescheduled Hearing -</p>
<p>Suslovva Kordia, a 26-year-old Russian woman, wife of a German aviator, living at No. 12 Talas Road, French Concession, is beautiful and has some savings. She is romantic and met Ladolai, a French man living at No. 698 Rue Pétain, two years ago, and they fell in love. Ladolai, 29 years old, originally opened a restaurant, but closed due to poor business. He then resided at Suslovva Kordia's house and owed six months of rent. Suslovva asked Ladolai to pay, but Ladolai was unable to do so, and the love between the two gradually cooled. Ladolai also owed a food store on Route Mercier eight yuan, which Suslovva guaranteed. The day before yesterday, Suslovva suddenly withdrew the guarantee, asking the store to claim directly from Ladolai. The two parties became antagonistic because of these monetary issues. On the 8th of this month, Suslovva evicted Ladolai. That night, Ladolai went to Suslovva's house, climbed up to the window, reached through the window, and slapped Suslovva in the face. At that time, Suslovva told Ladolai that if he came to make trouble again, she would use a gun. At the same time, Suslovva reported the incident to the French police station, requesting protection. Yesterday morning at eleven o'clock, the Russian restaurant on Route Mercier sent someone to Ladolai to demand the eight yuan food bill. Suslovva then telephoned Ladolai and asked him to pay the restaurant bill immediately. Therefore, Ladolai went to Suslovva's house at three o'clock in the afternoon, and the two parties had a major conflict over the restaurant bill. Suslovva turned and went into the room, took out a pistol, and threatened Ladolai. Unexpectedly, the gun went off, and the bullet flew out. Ladolai dodged quickly, narrowly escaping. At that moment, a French officer living upstairs heard the gunshot and went downstairs to investigate. He caught up and snatched the pistol from Suslovva. Suslovva saw that the officer also had a pistol on his belt. Her pistol had just been taken away by the officer, but she reached for the officer's pistol, intending to commit suicide. The officer caught up again and snatched it away. He immediately telephoned the French police station, which dispatched a Western detective to take Suslovva to the police station. Yesterday noon, she was transferred to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, and Chief Judge Wang Gangxu interrogated her. Police lawyer Fei Xizhen stated the case and charged her with attempted murder. Then, Western detective Ivanoff, who handled the case, reported on the arrest of the defendant and the investigation. Ladolai, the plaintiff, stated that he had been in love with the defendant for two years. Yesterday, the defendant used a pistol to threaten him but had no intention of killing him. He asked the court to release her, stating that he did not want to sue her now. When the court questioned the defendant, she became incoherent and fainted. Ladolai immediately went forward to pick up Suslovva, comforting her in every way, and asked the court to release her, saying that he was willing to go to jail for her. Then, the defendant's lawyer, Ai Zhenlin, requested that she be allowed to be released on bail pending the rescheduled hearing. The court obtained the consent of the police and ordered the defendant to be released on 1,000 yuan bail, with the rescheduled hearing set for the 30th of this month.</p>

<p>Shine Brightly on Gordon Road Last Night</p>
<p>The Light is Slightly Yellow, Passersby Stop and Stare in Surprise</p>
<p>According to the Datong News Agency, the Shanghai Electric Power Company recently plans to install a new type of street light with a longer range. According to the Datong News Agency reporter, the company's Chinese engineer revealed that the new street light uses sodium gas in a vacuum tube to emit light and is translated as Philora Sodium Lamp. Each sodium gas lamp can save a lot of electricity compared to ordinary street lights (ie, arc lamps), and the range of the light is also longer. The company has dispatched a large number of workers to rush to install the lights on Gordon Road (from Jing'an Temple Road to Avenue Haig). Seven or eight lights have been installed and tested last night. Compared with other ordinary street lights, the light is slightly yellow and exceptionally bright, causing those passing by to stop and stare in surprise. According to the Datong News Agency reporter, this sodium gas lamp is good, but the cost of each material needs to reach more than one hundred and fifty yuan, while the ordinary street lights currently used on the roads cost only more than ten yuan per lamp, which is too expensive and may exceed the Public Works Department's budget.</p>

<p>Apprentice at Yongshun Rice Shop Dies by Hanging</p>
<p>Why Was Sudden Illness Falsely Reported as Cause of Death?</p>
<p>Yesterday at 5:30 PM, the Public Security Bureau of the Fourth District of Zhabei received a phone call reporting that an apprentice at Yongshun Rice Shop, No. 385, west of Xinzha Bridge on Guangfu Road, was suffering from a sudden illness. The district immediately relayed the call to the Firefighting Joint Association, dispatching an ambulance. Upon arrival at the rice shop, it was discovered that the apprentice was not suffering from a sudden illness but had died by hanging on the drying platform. The Firefighting Association then called the Fourth District again. District Chief Gong, noting the discrepancy between the initial report of sudden illness and the Firefighting Association's report of death by hanging, considered the case suspicious. He dispatched police officer Wu Dichen to investigate. He found the apprentice kneeling on the drying platform, with several shop assistants attempting to rescue him, but the apprentice had already died. The deceased was wearing a singlet, white cotton pants, and gray socks, with a flat-top haircut. The owner of the rice shop, Yisheng, was also brought to the district for questioning. He stated that the apprentice's name was Wang Bogen, 19 years old, from Wusong, and had been working at the shop for four years, having completed his apprenticeship. Today (i.e., yesterday) was payday; the deceased earned seven yuan per month and had already received his wages. He did not know why he committed suicide. There were over ten other apprentices in the shop, as well as over ten accountants and senior staff members. After reviewing the statements, the official, considering the case a matter of life and death, reported it to the Public Security Bureau's Inspectorate and ordered the local bailiff to report it to the Shanghai Local Court for a coroner's inquest.</p>

<h3 id="e173">Exhortation to Venerate Confucius <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>By Wu Tiecheng</p>
<p>--The Significance of Commemorating the Former Teacher Confucius--</p>
<p>Recently, the Central Government has designated August 27th, Confucius's birthday, as a memorial day for the Most Sage and Former Teacher Confucius, to commemorate Confucius's noble and great personality, to elucidate Confucius's broad and profound learning, to invigorate the weak and frivolous minds of the people, and to save the culture that is about to be cut off. On this holy birthday, our national populace, carrying on the past and opening up the future, should deeply reflect on how to encourage and continue the legacy of the Former Teacher Confucius, and take on the historical mission of everyone. I hereby reveal several meanings to express the author's admiration.</p>
<p>In recent years, trendy and frivolous people in the country have often belittled Confucius's teachings, selectively quoting and arbitrarily distorting them, believing that they do not meet the needs of the times, even laughing, scolding, and wantonly insulting Confucius's personality. The truth that fills the universe has absolutely no absolute temporality, only true objective sociality. The survival of a nation also has its unshakeable foundation, which is history and culture. Therefore, although Premier Sun Yat-sen advocated a radical revolution, he not only did not destroy the foundation upon which the nation relied for its livelihood, but also cherished it for fear of not doing enough. Therefore, in Premier Sun Yat-sen's lectures on the principle of national revival, he said that we must restore the nation's self-confidence, and we must restore and promote the spirit of our country's inherent culture. This is the first basic understanding that we should have when commemorating Confucius today.</p>
<p>Examining the development of modern Western culture and the strength of national power, it all originates from the "Renaissance" (La Renaissance). The driving force of the Renaissance was the Greek thought that had been flowing underground for thousands of years. European history, viewed through the lens of culture, has two major sources: one is Greek thought and the other is Christian thought. The former is characterized by physical and instinctive, self-awareness, liberalism, the present world, human-centrism, self-satisfaction, naturalism, intellectual, artistic, scientific skepticism, empiricism, and objective tendencies. The latter is characterized by spiritual and ascetic, knowledge of God, absolute obedience, clericalism, the kingdom of heaven, theocentrism, altruism, supernaturalism, religious, moral, faith, dogmatism, and subjective tendencies. Greek thought originated more than 2,600 years ago, and was most developed during the time of Pericles in Athens, when reason and emotion could each find their balance. As Athens declined, Rome succeeded it, and it transformed into extreme selfish hedonism. Licentiousness, extravagance, and cruelty prevailed. Christian thought, to remedy these shortcomings and correct these deviations, arose in response. Although Christ died for his faith, the religion flourished greatly after three or four hundred years. However, once a single authority was established, abuses arose again. Monks monopolized knowledge to keep the people ignorant, clinging to the end of rituals and ceremonies, and losing their fundamental spirit. At that time, people became slaves of the monks. This created what historians call the "Dark Ages of the Middle Ages." At this time, the Greek thought that had been flowing underground for thousands of years rose up again, with a new look, emphasizing reason, valuing nature, and creating the development of modern science; respecting individuality, valuing freedom, and promoting the development of modern Western politics and society. From this, it can be seen that if an idea loses its true meaning, it will inevitably lead to abuses; if used properly, it can promote the evolution of society. It is not changed its value because of ancient and modern, new and old. This is the second basic understanding that we should have when commemorating Confucius today.</p>
<p>In the past history of China, successive dynasties hung up the banner of respecting Confucius, but in reality, it was Lao Tzu, not Confucius, that dominated the thinking of the Chinese people. Since the Han Dynasty, the style of learning had greatly deteriorated. The thoughts of various schools were suppressed, and the theory of investigating things to extend knowledge was even despised. The intellectual class, frustrated by the unpredictability of emperors and the unattainability of wealth and status, embraced the principles of purity and inaction, and adopted an attitude of patience and retreat, thereby creating a decadent individualism and a lazy romanticism. The scholars of the Han Dynasty emphasized the study of textual criticism. The scholars of the Jin, Wei, and Six Dynasties advocated the style of Huang-Lao and pure conversation. Later, the Tang Dynasty valued commentaries, the Song Dynasty valued Neo-Confucianism, the Ming Dynasty valued the Eight-legged essay, and the Qing Dynasty valued textual research. All of these failed to recognize the true meaning of Confucianism. Discussing metaphysics and practicing quietism became increasingly empty. Being obsessed with fame and fortune did nothing to improve the country and society. The decadent trend further formed a great social inertia, completely eliminating the active ability and enterprising spirit of the general public. After thousands of years of long history, our Chinese nation, whether in science, art, life, or in the methods and abilities of organizing society and establishing a country, has shown a phenomenon of decline and has not made significant progress. Therefore, if we want to seek the reasons for the decline of our nation today, we should not blame Confucius, but we should deeply regret the loss of the true meaning of Confucianism. This is the third basic understanding that we should have when commemorating Confucius today.</p>
<p>Confucius's knowledge is profound and broad, and this short article cannot describe even a fraction of it. However, Confucius's contribution to creating our national culture cannot be denied by any fair historian. The Chinese nation, in the time of Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, Wu, and the Duke of Zhou, can be said to have been a very glorious era. Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, Wu, and the Duke of Zhou all understood the principles and methods of building a country and organizing society. They were able to strive to create social and national systems in practice and gradually seek their improvement, thereby laying the foundation for the evolution of Chinese society. However, at that time, academic culture was very scattered. Although the Duke of Zhou created a model by formulating rituals and music, academic books were still stored in the palace and had not yet been popularized or democratized. Confucius was able to inherit the merits of Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, Wu, and the Duke of Zhou, and sort out, promote, and develop the various cultural relics and systems of that time, making them academic, systematic, popular, and democratic. He collected the great achievements of learning at that time. Confucius revived the spirit of "teaching tirelessly," based on the principles of the former kings' organization of the country and management of society, and then trained the public, influencing the public, and making the public understand the responsibilities they should bear to the country and society. Furthermore, based on the principles of extending knowledge through the investigation of things, making one's will sincere, rectifying one's heart, cultivating one's person, regulating one's family, governing one's state, and bringing peace to all under heaven, he established the foundation of our country's natural sciences, social sciences, ethics, and politics. This talent and merit in promoting culture and creating learning is especially worthy of admiration for all ages. This is the fourth basic understanding that we should have when commemorating Confucius today.</p>
<p>Since the New Culture Movement, the biggest reason why people criticized Confucius was the so-called "cannibalistic ethics." In fact, we still need to evaluate the true meaning and function of rites. "Rites are the reality of righteousness and the discipline of the public. Rites are based on human behavior and are used to regulate the people." (All of the above are from the Book of Rites) Zhu Xi explained rites as the manifestations of heavenly principles and the rules of human affairs. The "origin" of rites is based on human nature, which is the so-called manifestations of heavenly principles. The use of rites is manifested in everything and is omnipresent, which is the rules of human affairs. The former is immutable, while the latter can be adjusted according to the times. Therefore, it is said that the Five Emperors had different rites, and that Confucius was a sage who adapted to the times. Those who advocate overthrowing ethics now do not know its original meaning and its use, thinking that it hinders the evolution of society. However, they do not know that rites can be changed with the times. Therefore, when discussing the reasons for the slow progress of Chinese society, we cannot blame rites, but only the misunderstanding and misuse of rites. Moreover, the relationship between rites and law is particularly close. Confucianism believes that the power of habit to control society is very great. If habits cannot be improved, all good laws and intentions will be in vain. The profound meaning of Confucianism's advocacy of the rule of rites is to make "everyone have the conduct of a gentleman." Legalists say, "Do not blame the people who are good by themselves." Confucianism is the opposite of them, believing that without "self-good people," good politics cannot appear. The fundamental spirit of Confucian political theory is that everyone in the country should be educated and become "self-good people," taking the cultivation of national personality as the primary meaning in politics. To seek rites from the complicated formalities is not only to underestimate Confucianism, but simply to misunderstand the true meaning of rites (see Liang Qichao's Pre-Qin Political Thought). Since the Xinhai Revolution in China, all good laws and systems have been tragically defeated. The way to save the situation now is to start with cultivating habits that are compatible with the rule of law. Premier Sun Yat-sen, based on his practical political experience, divided the steps of national construction into three stages: military rule, tutelage, and constitutional rule. The so-called tutelage is a preparatory work for promoting the rule of law. Recently, in view of the failure of all political revolutions over the years, the New Life Movement has emerged. The function of the New Life Movement is to transform the national psychology and life, to cultivate a life and habits that are compatible with the new society ruled by law. The basic principles of the New Life Movement are "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame." From this, it can be seen that Confucius's ethics are suitable for the current needs of Chinese society. This is the fifth basic understanding that we should have when commemorating Confucius today.</p>
<p>Mr. Liang Qichao once said in his lecture criticizing Hu Shih's Outline of the History of Chinese Philosophy, "I still remember the phrase 'specially beating the Confucius shop.' I think that such idle words should be said less. When debating issues, one should not give in. One should always show due respect to the personality of the other side. If one laughs, scolds, and curses, one will reduce the value of one's own words. One should be so respectful even to contemporaries, let alone to the ancients who have been kind to society." People today are too fashionable and often like to cater to the shallow psychology of society, creating novelty and innovation, regardless of whether it is suitable for national conditions, thereby hindering the development of truth and causing endless harm to the country and society. It is hoped that the people of the country can reflect on and correct this common problem so as not to fail the country's good intentions in commemorating Confucius. August 25, 23rd year.</p>

<h3 id="e174">Re-discussing the Chicken and Egg Problem (Continued) <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>--Reply to Hu Jie and Others</p>
<p>Regarding these endless cyclical questions, if we only pay attention to the phenomena we see before us, and only use the phenomena before us to argue, it is absolutely impossible to resolve them. This is because all present events are the result of the development of many past events, and all things have long historical roots. If we only see the current phenomena and do not pay attention to the historical development, then we will not know the source of this phenomenon. If we do not find the true source historically, but instead engage in empty talk about the current cyclical phenomena, then even if we argue for thousands of years, we will not be able to determine who the chicken and the egg belong to. Mr. Wang Zaifu mentioned in his letter that there is someone who advocates that the egg came before the chicken, his reason being that "every egg can hatch a chicken, but every chicken cannot necessarily lay an egg (because half of them are roosters), so it should be the egg that produces the chicken, not the chicken that produces the egg." This kind of statement is precisely a joke arising from only paying attention to the immediate reason and not paying attention to the historical origin. When we observe anything, we must look at it from the perspective of its development. In our previous discussion on the chicken and egg problem, we explained it from the perspective of biological development. We said that the phenomenon of laying eggs is a phenomenon that only occurs after the development of organisms to the multicellular stage. Before multicellular animals were formed, the act of laying eggs would not occur, so initially, it was multicellular animals that laid eggs, not eggs that gave birth to multicellular animals. In other words, it is the chicken that produces the egg (because the chicken represents multicellularity), not the egg that produces the chicken (because the egg is just an ovum).</p>
<p>Regarding other similar cyclical problems, we also need to explore their historical roots. For example, the question of human thought and the social environment: sometimes human thought can influence the environment, and sometimes the environment can determine human thought. Is it thought that determines the environment, or is it the environment that determines thought? This becomes another unsolvable problem. The French mechanical materialists of the eighteenth century fell into this kind of circular argument and could not find a way out. They admitted that the environment could determine human reason, and at the same time admitted that reason could change the world. They could not find a way out because they did not know how to study the historical roots of reason and society. However, we now know to study the development of society from the economic and material foundation, so we can now undoubtedly determine that the social environment determines people's thoughts first. Then the two influence each other.</p>
<p>Regarding the previously mentioned problem of the individual supporting the family and the family supporting the individual, or the mutual relationship between the individual and the boarding house owner, we will not discuss it for the time being. Please, readers, study it themselves and consider how to solve it. It would be best if readers could write their opinions to us, and then we will provide a practical answer.</p>

<h3 id="e175">Ministry of Education Inspector <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Recent inspection of Hunan vocational education improvement suggestions (below)</p>
<p>(B) Regarding each school:</p>
<p>(1) Provincial Senior Agricultural Vocational School: In the past, due to the small area, students had difficulty with practical training, so it was difficult to be confident in their technical skills. Now that a new school site has been found, and the field is barely sufficient, a relocation and construction plan is underway. It seems that transformation is possible. In the future, special attention should be paid to the teaching of agriculture and forestry, and to the improvement and promotion of local production. Is the sericulture department suitable for local needs? In the few counties in southern and western Hunan where the sericulture industry has declined, is there any hope of reversing this? Is it possible for the quality and sales of silk cocoons to be on par with those of the provinces in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River? These questions are all necessary considerations for whether the school should continue to run the sericulture department. The school should decide on the conditions for setting up the department based on local conditions, and it is not necessary to stick to the original subjects, which are difficult to develop.</p>
<p>(2) Provincial Senior Industrial Vocational School: Both the mechanical and electrical engineering departments have a considerable foundation in practical training equipment. If the practical training is carried out properly, the mechanical engineering graduates can bear the manufacturing tasks of ordinary machine factories, and the electrical engineering graduates can also serve as managers of ordinary power plants. However, there are not many factories in the province, and students must develop outwards, so the employment situation is very difficult. All the equipment in the dyeing and weaving department is also sufficient for use. Although the applied chemistry department has experiments in papermaking, leather making, and soap making, the equipment is simple. The products of these two departments lack production value. They should be improved according to the following methods: A. According to the current vocational education situation in Hunan Province, the university's engineering college should be the center for training advanced technical personnel, and the senior industrial school should be the place for creating practical production personnel. Therefore, factory practice in senior industrial schools should not be broad and superficial, resulting in circular learning without any specialization. Attention should be paid to specialized skills in order to be practical. B. Mechanics can focus on imitation (see previous article) in order to promote it. For example, the various looms made by the school have excellent results and are not expensive. School factories can adopt them, which is a clear effect. The machinery that the chemistry department should add can be gradually manufactured by the school to make it complete. The design drawings of other ordinary industries (such as printing, flour milling, compression molding, iron making, slicing, dyeing, oil making, etc., which do not belong to the scope of precision and large-scale industries) should also be gradually collected widely as materials for students' research. C. If the practical training factory can be expanded, it can engage in an organization dedicated to production and manufacturing according to the factory system. For example, the clothing, leather goods, and cleaning and hygiene products used by students in various schools can be manufactured in large quantities, which can not only be used as a promotion of local production, but also as a model for students to operate production businesses. D. Select several kinds of practical training products and make them into marketable commodities. The design, style, decoration, and price should be researched and prepared. If you are confident, you can submit a request to the Education Department to raise temporary funds or guarantees to borrow money from the bank for turnover. At the same time, vocational supplementary classes can be attached to train apprentices.</p>
<p>(3) Private Xiuye Senior Agricultural Vocational School has been experimenting with improving rice seeds for many years, and has achieved results in increasing yields, which are being promoted. However, because this project is not very effective, it has now changed its approach and started with experimenting with rural side occupations, which is more profitable. The practical effect will be great in the future. The school is located outside Changsha City in an area with mountains and rivers. The field is barely sufficient. The vocational teachers lead students to work, which is quite serious. Students' practical training is divided into two types: divided land and public farming. Most of them wear short clothes and bare feet, cultivating in the fields, which can be regarded as hard work and training. However, judging from the school's funding and setting conditions, it should be appropriate to specialize in agricultural vocational subjects. The rural normal school department should find ways to gradually end it.</p>
<p>(4) The Private Gongshu Senior Civil Engineering Vocational School was founded by the carpentry trade union. The construction sites in the provincial capital and neighboring areas can all lead students to practice. Graduates also do not worry about finding employment, so they are very confident in the development of their careers. However, the rise and fall of construction engineering is related to the surplus and deficit of social economy. According to the trade union's statistics, the total value of construction engineering in Changsha City alone is more than 20 million yuan per year. In recent years, the trend has been upward. However, it is difficult to determine whether this constant state can be maintained. It is best to contact the trade unions in neighboring provinces to accept students from Wuhan, Yichang, Jiujiang, and Nanchang (based on those recommended by the trade unions) to broaden the training, which will be beneficial to both talent digestion and career improvement.</p>
<p>(5) The works of students in the normal and Western painting departments of the Private Huazhong Art School are still impressive. However, the equipment is simple and the scope is narrow. Charcoal drawing is the basic practice of Western methods. There are too few models, and it is difficult to accurately learn with the heart, hands, and eyes. Sketching goes without saying. If you strive for pleasing color matching in watercolor and oil painting, the foundation has not been established, and it will ultimately be empty and unrealistic. This point should be paid attention to. Chinese painting works are better than Western paintings, because people with higher talent can easily understand the artistic conception. However, obtaining its similarity is ultimately not as good as starting with meticulous brushwork of flowers, birds, and figures, and then learning freehand brushwork, which is more practical.</p>
<p>(6) Yueyang Private Hubin Middle School has gradually increased the settings for horticulture since it was changed to an agricultural department. The school has spacious school buildings, beautiful scenery, and is located in a fertile area on the side of Dongting Lake, which is most suitable for running an agricultural department. It is a pity that the funding is insufficient and the field cannot be expanded, so progress is difficult. If there are no security problems with the case of the Yueyang County Government entrusting the management of Junshan, it may be accepted. If the school's financial resources are insufficient, it can jointly convene leaders from all walks of life in the province and bank leaders with the county government to form a committee to handle it, because Junshan is a famous tea-producing area and a scenic spot. If managed properly, it will benefit the local area. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e176">Japan in the Northeast <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Promoting Enslavement Education</p>
<p>Datong School creates Japanese puppet county councilors</p>
<p>Recently established law school and imperial family school</p>
<p>The content of each textbook is full of enslaving nature</p>
<p>(Northeast Changchun News) The Japanese have wild ambitions to manipulate everything in the Northeast. They are especially strict in implementing their cultural aggression conspiracy in education. The teaching materials used are completely based on enslavement, intending to turn the people of the Northeast into slaves before stopping. The following is a record of the enslavement education situation obtained:</p>
<p>(Datong College) The puppet state, under the order of the Japanese army, established Datong College in Changchun. There are 120 students, 90 of whom are Japanese and 30 are from the puppet state. The 30 students from the puppet state have also studied in Japan and received Japanese education. These 120 students are usually assigned to various counties to investigate the production status of the people and to promote the puppet's "Royal Way Politics". When the county councilors arrive in Changchun, they also gather here to report on the situation of each county. The young and radical faction newly dispatched by the Japanese openly stated that the puppet state is a puppet and Japan is the main body, and everything must be handled in accordance with the Japanese, etc., with aggressive words. Therefore, many of the 30 students on the puppet state's side cannot bear it and want to leave. If they are slightly more mature and stable Japanese councilors, they will use pleasing words such as Japanese-Manchu cooperation, co-existence and co-prosperity to anesthetize people's hearts. Therefore, although the young and radical faction reveals their sharpness and are arrogant, they are indeed enough to arouse hatred. If the mature and stable faction sometimes makes people feel like they are sitting in the spring breeze, but it is enough to eliminate our national character, which is even more terrible without being noticed.</p>
<p>(Law School) The Ministry of Justice of the puppet Manchuria, under the order of the Japanese, recently established a law school in Nangang, Changchun, in order to train puppet judicial personnel. The official system was announced on August 21, including one principal, four professors, seven assistant professors, one recommended administrative official, two recommended translators, two recommended clerks, and two appointed clerks. It has also been internally decided that Mr. Furuta, the Japanese chief of general affairs of the puppet Ministry of Justice, will be the principal.</p>
<p>(Imperial Family School) The puppet State Council recently decided to set up "Imperial Family Children's Schools" in Changchun, Shenyang and other places. First run elementary schools, and then expand to middle schools and universities. It also invited the puppet Puyi to be the "principal of the Imperial Family Children's School." This "school" is only limited to "Imperial Family" children. It is only possible to enter the school. A preparatory office for the "Imperial Family" Children's School has been set up at the old site of Weicheng School in Xiaonanmen, Shenyang. At that time, the puppet Minister of Finance Xi Qia contributed 30,000 yuan as preparatory expenses, and 14 teachers were hired from Guan Nei to serve as professors in Shenyang and Changchun. It is also heard that in addition to these 14 Han people as professors, the rest are Japanese.</p>
<p>(Enslaving Teaching Materials) After the Puppet Fengtian Public Office Printing Bureau received a special order from the puppet court to print the elementary school textbooks compiled by the Puppet Ministry of Education, all printing will be completed, and from August 1, the enslaving subjects will be distributed to all elementary schools in the Northeast. The subjects in elementary school include textbooks on self-cultivation, foreign language arithmetic, nature, Japanese, etc. Senior elementary school teaches filial piety (abridged version), abridged version of The Analects, national history textbooks, and geography. It is heard that the Fengtian Printing Bureau is about to distribute the textbooks to bookshops for joint sales. From then on, the Three Principles of the People textbooks will disappear in the four northeastern provinces.</p>

Then, Ren Shuyong, president of the Science Society of China, reported on the establishment process and general situation of the society, stating that the Science Society of China was established in the fourth year of the Republic of China. From the fourth to the eighth year of the Republic of China, it was the germination period. From the ninth to the fourteenth year, it was the transplantation period. From the fifteenth year to the present, it has been the development period, and listed the work of the Science Society, such as translation, publication of publications (Science Magazine and Science Pictorial, etc.), science lectures, etc. Then, Zhu Kezhen, president of the Chinese Geographical Society, Qian Yunong, president of the Chinese Botanical Society, and Bing Nongshan, the person in charge of the Chinese Zoological Society, successively reported on the mission and affairs of each society (the Zoological Society was established this year).</p>
<p>(Chiang Kai-shek's speech) After the report, Chen Bulei delivered a speech on behalf of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, stating that the Chairman attached great importance to the Science Society. Recently, due to his hard work presiding over the military officer training corps, he felt unwell and could not come to participate in person. He specially ordered himself to represent him. The content of the speech was to widely expound on "investigating things to acquire knowledge and utilizing life to promote prosperity", and to encourage the Science Society to engage in academic research and scientific application. Then, Chairman Xiong was invited to deliver a speech, stating that the gathering of celebrities and scholars of the Science Society in Lushan adds luster to the mountains and rivers. Science can give life and kill people, and it can prosper a country and destroy a country. It is extremely important for the revival of the country and nation. I hope that attention will be paid to the application of science to revitalize the country, and I hope that experts will provide guidance on the various facilities in this province.</p>
<p>(Chen and Wang's speeches) Then, Chen Lifu, a member of the Central Committee, was invited to give a speech, stating that scientific research should focus on organizing our country's inherent knowledge, and should not be completely erased with the three words "unscientific". We must strive to integrate it so that all knowledge can be scientific. He also advocated that scientific research should pay attention to popularization so that the public can be affected by it. Then, Wang Xueting, Minister of Education, was invited to give a speech, which was divided into two points: 1. Pay attention to scientific research and its application. 2. Pay attention to the improvement of research on scientific education. Finally, Cheng Shihuang, Director of the Department of Education, gave a speech, expounding the significance of the Science Society meeting from the perspective of Lushan's history and geography, stating that the ancestor of Lushan's development was Master Yuan of the Jin Dynasty, who founded the Lotus Society as a Buddhist group. During the Song Dynasty, Mr. Zhu and Mr. Lu lectured at the Ludong Academy, which was the source of scholars from all directions. Today, there is the Science Society, which is opening a new era for Chinese academic culture after Buddhism and Neo-Confucianism.</p>

<p>Wuxi Elementary School Education Fees</p>
<p>Zang, Director of the Wuxi Education Bureau, submitted a request to the provincial government regarding the reduction of county education fees by the Department of Education, requesting that the recurrent expenses be maintained and issued as before. It is learned that Director Zang returned to Wuxi from the province at 4:00 pm yesterday. It is reported that regarding the issue of reducing education fees, the Department took into account the inevitable autumn famine and made an overall calculation. As to whether the county can maintain its old education budget, it will be determined after the Department sends personnel to Wuxi for calculation. It is also heard that Commissioner Deng, sent by the Department, has left the province to work in neighboring counties and will arrive in Wuxi soon. According to general predictions, the county's education funds and temporary activity fees will inevitably be cut. Even the recurrent expenses will probably be discounted. However, in order to take care of the future of elementary education, Director Zang is determined to do everything possible to exceed the 60% amount set by the Department, so that the advancement of elementary education will not be greatly affected.</p>

<p>Hua Yi'gan and Zhou Jia'mo Set Sail Yesterday</p>
<p>The Sino-French National Institute of Engineering has been jointly operated by the Chinese and French governments for more than a decade. This school is an industrial vocational school that has always adhered to strict principles, cultivating talent. Each year, outstanding students are selected and sent to France, Belgium, and other countries for further study. To date, more than thirty graduates have completed their studies and returned to China. This time, eight undergraduate students graduated, with Hua Yi'gan and Zhou Jia'mo ranking at the top. The school then requested the Sino-Belgian Boxer Indemnity Committee to fund their studies in Belgium, and they set sail yesterday. The remaining students have also been introduced to various locations for employment.</p>

<p>Expands Free Enrollment Quota</p>
<p>The Da Gong Vocational School and its affiliated junior high school, located in the Nanshi district of this city, were originally scheduled to open on the 28th of this month. However, due to the unfinished renovation of the new school building, the opening has been postponed to September 6th, with fee payment scheduled for the 6th and 7th, and registration on the 8th and 9th. Classes will temporarily be held at the old school building on Qiao Jia Road, outside the Xiao Nan Men, starting on the 10th. It is expected that the school will move to its new location on Longhua Road, near Ju Men Road, on October 1st. It is reported that the school has already received three times more new students than old students this year, and requests for admission are still pouring in. Therefore, an additional entrance examination will be held on September 5th to avoid disappointment. The school's principal, Mr. Lin Meiyan, recognizing the impact of rural bankruptcy on students' ability to pursue education due to economic hardship, has donated his salary to increase the number of free enrollment places. Both new and old students can apply for assistance, and the number of scholarship places will also be expanded, with service student positions added. This dual approach of rewards and subsidies is a great opportunity for those who cannot afford tuition in the midst of the current economic downturn.</p>

<p>United States and China Dominate</p>
<p>Japan and England Completely Defeated in Singles Yesterday</p>
<p>Exciting Doubles Matches Expected Today Between China and England</p>
<p>In Addition to Two Doubles Matches, There Will Also Be Two Singles Matches Between China and England</p>
<p>The Rotary Cup Shanghai International Tennis Tournament, with China vs. England and the United States vs. Japan, held its semifinals simultaneously at the Shanghai Tennis Club yesterday afternoon. Despite the scorching sun, there were still over three hundred spectators. In the four singles matches, the United States and China both achieved complete victories. The performances of the American players Carlsen and Squire were exceptionally beautiful, surpassing their previous performances, forcing the Japanese players Machida and Sudo to concede defeat. China's Zheng Zhaojia and Wang Wenzheng played casually and were assured of victory. England's Stock and Forbes were unable to fight and collapsed at the mere sight of their opponents. This afternoon will be the doubles matches for the four countries, but because the English side cannot spare the time on Monday, the final two singles matches will be held simultaneously today. Therefore, the qualification for the finals between China and England will be decided this afternoon. The details of yesterday's battles are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e192">United States Wins Against Japan <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Carlsen Overpowers Machida: The match between the American first singles player Carlsen and the Japanese player Machida began at 3:00 PM. Both players performed well, with long rallies and net interceptions that were quite impressive. Carlsen's technique, in particular, has improved significantly, as evidenced by his straight-set victory over Wang Wenzheng the other day, which was no accident. Machida's long rallies from deep behind the baseline often caused Carlsen to struggle to keep up. However, Carlsen made good use of his net play, which proved to be very effective, greatly troubling Machida, who lost two sets with scores of 6-4 and 6-3. In the third set, Machida had a very good chance of winning, leading 5-3 and then 5-4. Machida was serving with a score of 3-2, just needing one more point to win the set. Unexpectedly, he hit a ball out of bounds, making the score 40-40 (3-3). He then lost the game, making the set score 5-5. Carlsen then took the lead at 6-5. Machida tied it again, but Carlsen finally won two consecutive games, resulting in a straight-set victory.</p>
<p>6-4</p>
<p>Carlsen (USA) {6-3} Machida (Japan)</p>
<p>8-6</p>
<p>Squire Defeats Sudo: The American second singles player Squire's skills are also far from what they used to be. He made good use of chop shots, reaching deep behind the baseline, and sweeping to both corners. He had very few net touches and out-of-bounds balls, and he was good at running, with a very good grasp of saving the ball. He fought by moving back and forth, dashing all over the court. Japan's Sudo, although also a steady and enduring player, ultimately failed due to slightly inferior skills. Squire won the first two sets easily with scores of 6-3 and 6-1. In the third set, Sudo led 3-1 and 5-3. Squire captured the serve game, making the score 5-4. Sudo was serving, but Squire lost four consecutive points, so Sudo won the set 6-4. In the fourth set, Squire returned to his original form and won it easily with a score of 6-2.</p>
<p>6-3</p>
<p>Squire (USA) {6-1} Sudo (Japan)</p>
<p>4-6</p>
<p>6-2</p>
<h3 id="e193">China Wins Against England <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Zheng Zhaojia Wins Against Stock: The China-England match followed the US-Japan match. This year, China did not use the veteran players Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai for singles, but instead used the rising stars Zheng Zhaojia and Wang Wenzheng. Regardless of whether they win the championship, this approach is very appropriate and can raise the profile of the tennis community, letting people know that in addition to Lin and Qiu, there are also players like Zheng and Wang who deserve attention. Zheng's opponent was Stock, and it was a one-sided situation. Zheng took the first four games without any effort, but then he made careless mistakes, often sending the ball into the net or out of bounds, allowing his opponent to catch up to 5-4. He only won 6-4. In the second set, the opponent was too sluggish, and Zheng did not show much excitement, just casually responding, and won 6-1. In the third set, Zheng won again 6-3. Zheng's strategy was quite clever, and his ball control was also very skilled, but he still made too many double faults on serves, which should be paid attention to.</p>
<p>6-4</p>
<p>Zheng Zhaojia (China) {6-1} Stock (England)</p>
<p>6-3</p>
<p>Wang Wenzheng Defeats Forbes: England's Forbes was a finalist in last year's Shanghai Junior Singles, with more than enough stability, but not enough attack. Wang Wenzheng was just testing the waters, and a straight-set victory was expected. However, Wang's shots were very polite, just casually responding, winning 6-3, 6-2, in a leisurely manner. In the third set, Wang led 4-1, and Forbes caught up to 5-4, but Wang won 6-4 in the end. Wang's skills have not improved, and his ball control has no variation. If he encounters someone of equal strength, he will definitely suffer. He really should use more intelligence to explore.</p>
<p>6-3</p>
<p>Wang Wenzheng (China) {6-2} Forbes (England)</p>
<p>6-4</p>
<h3 id="e194">Today is Very Important <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Exciting Doubles Matches are a Must: In addition to the US-Japan and China-England doubles matches, today's schedule also includes the two China-England doubles matches that were brought forward, so there are a total of four matches. Among them, the China-England doubles match is the most important, and it is also the exciting match that Shanghai has never had before. It can also predict who will win this year's Robert Cup International Doubles Championship, because the English players are represented by the famous players Deff and Pennyfeather, while the Chinese are represented by the veteran players Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai, who are both representatives of the Robert Cup and the best doubles team in Shanghai. Therefore, today's battle is bound to be a sensation. The schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Carlsen (USA) vs. Tsukiji (Japan) 3:00 PM Doubles Squire Kamada</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai (China) vs. Deff (England) 4:30 PM Doubles Lin Baohua Pennyfeather</p>
<p>Singles Zheng Zhaojia (China) vs. Forbes (England) 5:30 PM Wang Wenzheng (China) vs. Stock (England) 5:30 PM</p>

<h3 id="e203">Who is Promoting Cosmetics? <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Yun Shang</p>
<p>In the newspapers of the past month, the alarming figures of foreign cosmetic imports have been repeatedly published. But upon closer inspection, this year's first half, including lace, is only worth 1.5 million. If we actually knew the economic and political status of women in Shanghai, there would be nothing to be surprised about.</p>
<p>According to a recent report, Shanghai has a total of 3.4 million residents, half of whom are women, totaling 1.7 million. Excluding those who push dung carts, sell vegetables, and live in straw shacks in Caojiadu, Yangshupu, Pudong, and other areas of poor farmers and workers, women from ten to fifty years old, without exception, automatically purchase cosmetics. And those dancers, stars, socialites, concubines, and various types of prostitutes buy even more than ordinary people each month. Assuming that women who buy cosmetics account for slightly less than one-third of all women in Shanghai each month—500,000 people—then the average amount of foreign cosmetics purchased per person is only 50 cents.</p>
<p>But when we look at the cost of cosmetics used by those dancers and social stars, it's more than 50 cents a day. Because 50 cents a day is only 15 yuan a month, which is far from the truth. According to my estimate, there are 200,000 women in Shanghai who use more than one yuan worth of cosmetics each month, including hair tonic, eyebrow pencils, rouge, lip balm, powder, nail polish, perfume, soap, cold cream, various beauty products, and so on. If this is true, then there are about 6 million cosmetic costs on these women each month, not including the miscellaneous expenses such as hair perms, utensils, and maid wages.</p>
<p>Don't men use cosmetics? Hair tonic is now used more by men than women in the city. Many men also use cold cream and perfume. Let's ignore that for now.</p>
<p>What we should be studying now is the motivation and need of the 500,000 Shanghai women who buy an average of 50 cents worth of foreign cosmetics each month. Among them, the ones who need cosmetics the most are those women who live a "prostitute-like life." The number of these women in Shanghai is alarming, ranging from the concubines of high officials and wealthy people to the "wild chickens" who solicit customers on the street, including school queens, office flowers, female shop assistants who serve as signage in shops, and social stars who specialize in accompanying people to dance. This type of woman uses the most cosmetics. However, the reason why they must use a large amount of cosmetics is entirely to maintain their "business." A sweaty dancer or prostitute who does not attract male customers—players—is undoubtedly an absolute fact. Even the title of "Queen" in those schools cannot be obtained by a female student who does not wear makeup, does not perm her hair, does not use perfume and nail polish, and wears cloth clothes and shoes. Moreover, it is a confirmed fact that part of the cosmetics used by this type of woman is often given by men.</p>
<p>In this way, the truth of the matter is clear. The use of large quantities of cosmetics on special women is equivalent to the coal and water needed for a locomotive to run, or the gasoline used by a car. Although the running of trains and cars is increasingly old and damaged, the consumption of coal, water and gasoline only bears a relationship to its own power to be used. How is the case of a prostitute-style woman and cosmetics different?</p>
<p>In Shanghai, apart from the working masses, there are frustrated politicians and bureaucrats, wealthy idlers, and young playboys. With this group of treasures concentrated in Shanghai, countless prostitute-style women live wasteful lives day and night, wrapped in cosmetics, eating, drinking, and having fun.</p>
<p>Then who exactly buys cosmetics and needs cosmetics? Is the large import of foreign cosmetics the fault of the dancers and prostitutes themselves who use a lot of cosmetics? Can we still bear to blame them?</p>
<p>In short, is it not a travesty that the country is so disorganized that its domestic market is not occupied by its own industry and has no way to resist the economic invasion of foreign races, and is the blame for the import of cosmetics placed on the pitiful prostitutes?</p>

<h3 id="e204">Soviet Wives <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Anra Louse Strong, Translated by Liang Qiu</p>
<p>(This is a self-account by an American woman who married a Soviet man. From this, one can observe the various perspectives of Soviet women on relationships. The Soviet Union is a mysterious country in the eyes of the world, and these perspectives are worth our attention. Therefore, I specially translated it for the readers.)</p>
<p>Recently, while traveling and giving speeches in the United States, I happened to have dinner at an old friend's house. After the meal, I mentioned that I had gotten married in Moscow two years ago. Suddenly, everyone at the table looked at me as if surprised, and in their questions, they expressed their doubts and misunderstandings about our marriage.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, a girlfriend interrogated me about the so-called "personal life" of Soviet people for hours. Although I answered her faithfully, I knew she still couldn't understand. Later, while discussing some admirable human virtues, I said that my husband possessed this virtue to a high degree. "I think you 'like' your husband," she said in surprise. This time, I was really annoyed. "Why would I live with someone I don't like?" I replied. But from her conversation, I wondered why she lived with her husband. Because she frankly told me that she despised certain characteristics of her husband - his almost useless honesty, which made him a pleasant companion but was not conducive to making money under capitalism. Having dinner at her house, this unvarnished and harsh conversation - from her dissatisfaction with a useless husband to her wandering, wasteful children - was very unpleasant to listen to. What traditional forces, what economic oppression, made her endure such unpleasant dinners day after day?</p>
<p>If such disgusting conversations occurred during meals in a Soviet family, their simple separation would be the end of it. Life is so short, so precious, that it is not worth wasting on unpleasant companions. Sometimes, in their professions, people must endure unpleasant companions in order to receive training and achieve career success. But the purpose of family is not for training and career; it is only for recreation and rest in life. Why should humans endure such unpleasant companions?</p>
<p>I know that stating the purpose of family in this way seems very reasonable to Soviet wives, but it challenges two kinds of ancient marriage concepts: one is the family concept advocated by the church, and the other is the family concept under feudal capitalism. Such as Bacon's view of family, the concept of children that makes many mothers endure lifelong pain, the concept of relying on others, etc. - these concepts disappear like smoke in Soviet marriages.</p>
<p>In the eyes of Soviet wives, marriage is not related to religion, law, or property rights. These things are completely unimportant to our lives. No one has a lot of money, so property rights are very simple. What was owned before marriage remains individually owned after marriage; what is acquired after marriage is jointly owned by both. The wages earned by the couple are jointly owned and used, with a very small portion saved for the future. Religion still exists among those who need it; church weddings still happen sometimes. The law also exists; most, though not all, marriages are properly registered, but no one would ask their friends if their marriage is registered.</p>
<p>For us, the essence of marriage is lasting friendship, making physiological, mental, and emotional life satisfying and fulfilling. How long it will last, only future facts can tell; we hope it will last a lifetime, but we cannot guarantee it. For those who marry, almost everyone, marriage means mutually participating in future life through raising children. No normal person does not want to have children. I can't recall a single old maid among my Soviet acquaintances. But marriage is just a kind of friendship; and children are the only key to future life. Personal "love" is just a song in an opera to us; its complex and noisy chords only occupy a very limited time in the entire play.</p>
<p>If our marriage is so informal, without restrictions or coercion, simply registered at the government office, sometimes not even registered, and seems not to be a "proper marriage" in the eyes of people outside the Soviet Union, then we must also say that marriages in capitalist society, as we see in novels and newspapers, are either terrifying or ridiculous. Announcing marriage in newspapers seems very strange to us. If, like in America, our marriage news were filled with social news and our photos appeared among many white flowers, boasting and exaggerating our personal feelings like that, we would feel very ashamed. We announce our marriage to a few close friends, often after the wedding rather than before.</p>
<p>We are also not hypocritical in not wanting to announce. If we receive scientific honors, or become a leading driver in a collective farm, or win a manufacturing award in a factory, we would feel proud to have our names published in the newspaper. If our photo could be raised high on a pole during the May Day celebration and our comrades reported to the world that we are warriors, that would make us feel supremely honored. Because these are our public actions, worthy of praise or criticism. Marriage is our private life, a personal matter!</p>
<h3 id="e205">The Ideal Woman in the Eyes of Japanese Female Students <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Du Bu</p>
<p>— Healthy and dignified —</p>
<p>— Virtuous Mother, Good Wife —</p>
<p>In Japan, the phrase "extraordinary times" can be seen and heard everywhere now. The government is a government of extraordinary times, national policies are policies of extraordinary times, and even when friends meet, they say, "These are extraordinary times." What are "extraordinary times"? People don't seem to understand very clearly. But we know that the so-called "extraordinary times" means that Japanese imperialism is using all its power to annex China and seize hegemony in the Pacific. To achieve this goal, they vaguely use the phrase "extraordinary times" to lure the Japanese people, advocating absolute patriotism, aggression, hero worship, martial spirit, and widespread creation of a war mentality within the country, so that the Japanese people immersed in this poison enthusiastically support Japan's aggression against China, hatred of the Soviet Union, and its hegemonic policy against the United States. Therefore, a "war atmosphere" envelops the entire Japan.</p>
<p>In this era, what are general Japanese women like? What kind of ideals do they have under this "extraordinary times" atmosphere? This is a question worth paying attention to. Recently, the Japanese Ministry of Education, perhaps to test the extent to which the poison they have cultivated has permeated the Japanese people, especially women, conducted a survey among women in Tokyo and other regions, asking them to answer the question "What are the elements of a modern ideal woman?" According to their published statistics, the elements of an ideal woman that Japanese women hope for are as follows:</p>
<p>A. Statistical results from 1,360 senior female students from fourteen schools in Tokyo:</p>
<p>(1) Health. (2) Femininity. (3) Cheerfulness. (4) Profound interests. (5) Strong will. (6) Sense of chastity. (7) Domesticity. (8) Understanding of social situations. (9) Common sense.</p>
<p>B. Statistical results from 3,261 senior female students from thirty-one schools in other regions:</p>
<p>(1) Health. (2) Cheerfulness. (3) Economic awareness. (4) Femininity. (5) Dignified appearance. (6) Sense of chastity. (7) Common sense. (8) Cultured. (9) Profound interests. (10) Strong will.</p>
<p>Among these, health is the most frequently mentioned element in both Tokyo and other regions. 69% in Tokyo and 64% in other regions, more than half, believe it is an element of a modern ideal woman.</p>
<p>From these statistics, it is clear that women still exhibit feminine characteristics. First, we do not see any of the frenzy or brutality of "extraordinary times" here. They are still very peaceful and seem unaffected by the "extraordinary times." The "war atmosphere" and hero worship are still absent. They honestly seek health, and health first seems to be the ideal element that Japanese women imagine. Second, the education of Japanese virtuous mother and good wife ideology is still deeply rooted. Women are domestic, feminine, and have a sense of chastity. In short, they are people of the family, not like men who participate in social activities. The life of creating new history, the life of shaking the world, the new life of liberated women, does not seem to have formed a concept in their minds. Third, their hope is still to be a good housewife, a so-called good wife who serves her husband, a so-called virtuous mother, a docile weakling, a gentle follower. Therefore, they still cannot escape the scope of sacrifice in "extraordinary times" because they do not consider the pursuit of new ideals as the epitome of an ideal woman. However, this is only the view of a portion of female students. In addition, there are certainly many active women.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Career Paths for American Female Graduates <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Geng Longgen</p>
<p>Most American female students are very fond of playing. They have never had any understanding of the world. What they like is to dance and play with their favorite men every day, living a life without rules. But after they graduate, due to economic needs, they have to find a job. Some can get a job because their fathers or relatives and friends are important officials in companies, banks, or government agencies; others do not have this opportunity, but they can still go to the placement bureau at school to ask for their help. Below are some of the jobs that the placement bureau of a women's college in the eastern United States has listed as available for introduction:</p>
<p>1. Direct social work. 2. Assistant work in laboratories of hospitals, universities, factories, government agencies, etc. 3. Statistical work in banks, insurance companies, government agencies, etc. 4. Assistant editor work in newspapers and bookstores. 5. Clerk work in commercial and educational institutions. 6. Various jobs in large department stores. 7. Secretarial work that requires or does not require shorthand and typing. The jobs listed above are certainly not what graduates of women's colleges want to do, but there is no other way. However, there are still things they cannot do in these jobs. Therefore, the smart school authorities set up a cram school that can be completed in a few weeks during the vacation after graduation; in this way, on the one hand, they teach skills such as typing, shorthand, and statistics; on the other hand, for the limited positions in the placement bureau, they restrict them to students with better grades, and there is a fair distribution.</p>
<p>But what about those graduates who cannot be introduced by the placement office? Unless they get lucky, they can only go outside to solicit business for wireless companies, insurance companies, cosmetics factories, automobile companies, etc. They must pay the company a guarantee in advance; when they solicit business, they can get a little commission. If they cannot solicit business, not only can they not get a commission, but the company may even dismiss them.</p>
<p>Some become nannies for rich people's children or announcers for radio stations, etc. Still others have it really tough - they actually work as Dearies in department stores. A Dearie is a woman who has not been educated because she is beautiful and has a flirtatious attitude. She uses the word Dearie (darling) to address everyone. The owner of the department store hires them to attract vulgar customers.</p>
<p>Of course, being a teacher is a better job for women, but previous graduates have already occupied most of the positions, and newly graduated students inevitably lack the experience of those who have taught, so newly graduated students are rarely hired to teach. Therefore, parents of American female students now mostly advise their daughters to study medicine, pharmacy, law, commerce, and library management, etc., because these can make it easier for their daughters to find a way out after graduation.</p>
<h3 id="e207">A Living Person Arrives <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Bing Yun</p>
<p>When she received the news of her only younger sister's death, her heart was almost shattered. She seemed to be electrocuted, holding the letter in both hands, her face very pale, standing like a wooden chicken in front of the south-facing window. The letter slowly fell from her hand. Her knees softened, and she knelt down involuntarily. Her left hand was pressing on her throbbing heart, raising her right hand, just like a pastor praying in a church. The mother rolled on the ground like a madwoman; the neighbors all ran into their room. A bird's nest-like house was crowded with people, each saying a word to comfort her, but their shallow comfort only increased her sorrow. She cried more and more sadly, more and more fiercely, constantly beating her chest and stamping her feet. She thought of the tragic fate of her family, her wandering life, and felt as if ten thousand arrows were piercing her heart, her liver and intestines were broken!</p>
<p>She recalled the cruel past hatred that had left her body and mind crippled, and she limped back to her mother's house. Although it was a deep mother-daughter relationship, her mother, who was financially weak, actually wanted to refuse the return of her sick daughter with tears. Fortunately, her young sister, chivalrous and brave, stood up to shoulder the burden of her weak sister's life. She said: Mom! It will be tough for these two years! I will have a way when I graduate from high school. She went to school during the day and copied for people at night until late, counting the days one by one, and the expected time came closer and closer, but unexpectedly…</p>
<p>The old mother was already over sixty, and she didn't know who to entrust her remaining years to; and she herself was already married at home, and abandoned outside, so what could she rely on? Moreover, with this ugly disease, even benevolent gentlemen should avoid her.</p>
<p>She thought that heaven and earth created people, and she didn't know whether to call it "living" or to call it "dying"? How could she end up in this half-dead state? Her good sister, who was seventeen or eighteen years old, wanted to take on the livelihood of a family of three. However, her sister was so diligent on weekdays, but now she had failed the graduation exam, cutting off her life, cutting off the life of the whole family that she bore, so suffering drove her to her death!</p>
<p>Death! Why doesn't death leave enough dead people, but only wants to call the useful living to go? Her sister was very useful, even though she failed the exam. If she had died earlier, her sister might have had a lighter burden and would not have been so urgent to commit suicide, as if there was a thorn in her back. She thought that she, this living corpse, had implicated good people!</p>
<p>She thought confusedly for a long time, and in the dark room, there was no one but her mother's low breathing. She silently raised a glass of medicine to her lips, murmuring:</p>

<h3 id="e208">Let's Talk About the "Virtuous Mother, Good Wife" System <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Yun Qi</p>
<p>Under the call of "Women! Return to the home!", the virtuous mother, good wife system has once again been praised by the general public. Regarding "virtuous mother, good wife," opinions on its interpretation have been very inconsistent throughout history. Generally, what people mean by a virtuous mother is one who absolutely obeys her husband's will, bears all the trivial matters of the family, works hard and complains little, and never resigns until death. A good wife is one who is solely responsible for the reproduction and education of her children. Such a virtuous mother and good wife, from the perspective of the historical development of class, that is, from the perspective of medieval feudal society, certainly has its own role or significance. However, in reality, this system has always been a one-sided obligation or morality, a cunning means used by men to bind women and make them become domestic slaves. Just like "chastity," it is only used by men to implement the restriction of women as their one-sided sexual tools. All one-sided obligations or morals are tools to oppress people and shackles to bind people.</p>
<p>Since the development of capitalism in various countries, countless rural and urban women have been forced to leave their families and enter factories and various social institutions (shops, schools! etc.). Thus, the medieval family system was destroyed, and women also gained more or less partial economic independence, no longer able to endure one-sided restrictions and oppression from men. Thus, the women's movement demanding women's liberation arose. And the initial goal of the women's movement was to break the old-fashioned family system and liberate the masses of women from domestic slavery. It opposes all the one-sided obligations, morals, and etiquette of the medieval family, and demands equal rights with men in the economic, political, and cultural aspects. From this, we can fully understand that anyone who advocates restoring the virtuous mother, good wife system is actually advocating restoring the family system of the medieval feudal era and all the tools that come with it to oppress women. In other words, it is to return to men all the achievements (such as the right to freedom of marriage, the right to inheritance, the right to vote...) that women have already gained through long-term struggle, and force them to return to the home to be domestic slaves and sexual tools again.</p>
<p>However, in reality, can the virtuous mother, good wife system be restored? For example, just from the perspective of China, hundreds of thousands of farmers have gone bankrupt, and the farmers' families have been destroyed from the root. Either the husband goes out to work, becomes a soldier (or even a bandit), or the wife goes out to work as a female worker or a nanny. In this situation, the whole family is scattered, so how can one talk about virtuous mothers and good wives? Pure worker families are even more miserable under the cruel exploitation and oppression of capitalists and the long-term threat of continuous unemployment. Talking about virtuous mothers and good wives to them is just a dream! In fact, the "virtuous mother, good wife" system that people are now advocating can only have some influence in the petty bourgeois class at most.</p>
<p>Although the virtuous mother, good wife system violates objective facts and cannot have much influence, we cannot but criticize this retrogressive movement and cannot but protest against it. We should tell those who are reversing the wheels of history: it is impossible to go against history, history must always move forward, and those who go against history will inevitably be crushed by the wheels of history. Modern women will never be subjected to such a foolish policy again.</p>

<p>— Zi Gang</p>
<p>With a heart as heavy as a camel's burden, I walked on the sidewalk of the asphalt road. The streets of the big city are so noisy even during the day, only with fewer lights. Under the lights, everything is beautified. Even the sins of the devil are not as hideous as in the daytime.</p>
<p>Walking into XX Fang, I crossed a small path covered with coal ash, across from the watermelon peels and garbage piles, to pick up my repaired fountain pen.</p>
<p>"Is that...Xiao Yu!"</p>
<p>A hoarse throat called out to me. My heart jumped. I had been in Shanghai for almost half a month, and it was as if I had arrived in the desert, unable to even catch a glimpse of a single acquaintance from afar.</p>
<p>As soon as I looked up, a pair of familiar gray-yellow eyes! Followed by a string of female workers carrying boxes and small baskets behind the girl who had lost her youthful fire. Looking at the girl in front of me again, she was also wearing a tin can.</p>
<p>"A Qiu!" My eyes were probably wet. Happiness choked me. Looking at A Qiu, at least she had been redrawn, a circle smaller than five years ago. Thinner.</p>
<p>She held my shoulder:</p>
<p>"Xiao Yu, how are you? What brings you to Shanghai too?" Only those gray-yellow eyes hadn't changed. They might be less bright normally, but in these few minutes, they were excited.</p>
<p>"Something came up, I have to go home right away." I lied. Why disappoint someone? She had advised me to leave school like an older sister. Life had taught her to be more successful than anything else. She struggled in hardship, floating north and south like duckweed. I could only feel ashamed and lower my head. I couldn't forget her words when she let go of my hand in the north:</p>
<p>"Do you still want to hide away and read dead books? Do you still want to paste a paper gold coat on your flesh? You should drop your books early and throw yourself into real life." I remembered clearly that she even pinched my arm hard.</p>
<p>"Really, you forgot me, I forgot you!"</p>
<p>"Did you graduate? Are you putting on another set of clothes!"</p>
<p>This harsh mouth would never change! I nodded with a smiling face:</p>
<p>"Don't mention it, your story is more interesting than mine." Her environment only allowed her to study until elementary school. She wasn't discouraged. She followed her brothers' path and finally came to Shanghai with an old villager. She only sent a short note after going:</p>
<p>"Real life is more precious than diamonds. Here, people are aware of the meaning of working for the group. I labor, I temper in the burning furnace, I melt in the fluid, the fluid is mixed with me, this ball of fire wants to purify the universe."</p>
<p>It was simply an incomprehensible note. I wondered strangely why A Qiu had this perseverance. Perhaps it was a gift from the struggle with hardship!</p>
<p>"Are you driving a car?" I saw that this was the XX Yarn Factory.</p>
<p>She nodded: "Besides the blood and sweat that must flow for a grain of rice, here there is happiness that makes you feel the tension of life. The suffering is great enough, but, oh--no one is prepared to be a lifelong slave! We are tightly connected like new elastic bands!" Her hoarse voice became calm and slight, but it stuck to my heart like cement.</p>
<p>She accompanied me to get the pen and we parted at the factory gate. I was ridiculed a lot, but the ridicule only made me feel sincere.</p>
<p>"Coward!" I cursed myself on the way home. My heart was on fire.</p>

<p>Previous Dynasty Overcompensated in Covering Shorts</p>
<p>Gold Speculators Rejoice as Sellers Gain Momentum</p>
<p>Although American Bank Exchange Rate Narrows</p>
<p>Still Drops Three Yuan and Three Jiao</p>
<p>The gold market, due to the previous dynasty's overcompensation in covering shorts, saw a decrease of 10,000 taels in market inventory. General sentiment predicted little hope for a resurgence of short-covering, so sellers boldly stepped forward. Speculator Wu also divested holdings, causing gold prices to shift from rising to falling. Although there was some struggle mid-course, buying interest was extremely weak, with supply exceeding demand, resulting in a decline. The laxity and oversupply of the exchange market likely fueled selling pressure. Initially, the exchange rate moved downwards uniformly in the morning due to flat conditions in the overseas silver market and a narrowing of the US exchange rate. American cotton rose eleven points, American wheat rose 0.0625, and stocks also rose 1.43 yuan. Public sentiment was greatly stirred by the sudden reduction of 0.125 in the American Bank exchange rate after the US government's intervention. The gross price of goods opened higher, rising to 63 yuan. In anticipation of trading, gold prices even rose as high as 4.8 jiao. Eventually, as the exchange market opened uneventfully, the high supply of resources caused a setback. Although there was some rebound after opening, the banks' appetite declined, and arbitrageurs aggressively divested. Although shorts covered, the market inventory had already decreased by approximately 10,000 taels, leading others to predict a lack of significant strength. In addition, the prior knowledge that the HSBC exchange rate was flat for the British pound but only narrowed by 0.125 for the US dollar caused slight disappointment, so prices retreated within the 60-yuan range. However, buyers were still unwilling to easily show weakness and were able to struggle within the 60-yuan range. Ultimately, due to weakening public sentiment and a lack of buying interest from Chinese merchants in the domestic market, prices declined. Reuters reported that the American firm Laiche Ferry &amp; Co. announced today that it would increase its gold exports to $5,000,000, and Manhattan Bank also stated that it would increase its gold exports to $1,500,000. There was still a rebound after the decline, but the overall trend was difficult to sustain. Seeing the difficulty in turning the tide, buyers became weak, and unfavorable rumors circulated, further intensifying selling pressure in the market. The banks' domestic prices remained firm, and the situation was most fatigued at noon. Half-day trading was still active, but with continued exports of silver, the situation remained one of supply exceeding demand. October futures inventory had decreased to just over 31,000 taels after the aggressive short-covering the previous day. The half-day market situation is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening price was 962.7 yuan, an increase of 4.6 yuan from the previous close. The opening price for goods was 2.8 jiao. The exchange market morning opening prices for near-term sales were 1 shilling, 4 pence, 0.05625 and 0.0625 for the British pound and 35 yuan for the US dollar. Zhaofeng Chang, Yongli Yuanmao, and Yongjin reached 4 yuan. Maijia Li and Citibank sold November US dollars at 0.1875, and Dafa Yongheng Yu Yifeng and Yongyicheng sold futures, retreating to around 2 yuan. Ganchang Xiang, Dadecheng, and Futaiheng advanced, while Ruikang, Dadecheng, Yuanmao Yong, Yongfeng Dingkang, Huixiang, Yuqing, and Yong Maijia Li came out with November US dollars at 0.025, retreating to 1.2 jiao. Yuanchang Yong Dingkang Zhengchang advanced to 2.2 jiao. Prior knowledge that the HSBC exchange rate was flat for the British pound and only narrowed by 0.125 for the US dollar prompted the Dalian gang, Fuyu Zhaofeng Chang Yuanmao Yong Dingkang to sell, breaking the 60 yuan mark, retreating to 59.6 yuan. Hengtai Fuxing Yong Tianfeng Yong Yifeng Yong jointly purchased, gradually rising to 61.3 yuan. After entering, the domestic market remained loose, and the Dalian gang, Heng Yu, Dadecheng, Zhaofeng Chang successively sold, making it difficult to sell this month's US dollars at 0.1875, retreating to 57.7 yuan. Daxing Yongli purchased, pulling up one yuan, struggling. However, Yuqing Yong Dachang Xiang Chunyuan Yong Zhengchang Wanxing sold aggressively, dropping to 6.2 yuan. Qingyu took advantage of the low price to cover shorts, stabilizing the market. There was talk of American gold being exported. Daxing Yongheng Yu again advanced to around 8 yuan. Under pressure, public sentiment remained weak, and the domestic market became firmer again. Heng Yu advanced and then retreated. Qingyu Yuqing Yong Yuanfeng Yong Shunmao Fuyu Yuansheng Yong Dadecheng Senchang Yongyicheng Zhengchang all sold. Mitsui came out with December US dollars at 0.4375, retreating within 5 yuan. Although Dafa Yong advanced, Yuqing Yong Zhengchang sold aggressively, dropping to 4.1 yuan. Dafa Yong Zhaofeng Chang took advantage of the low price to buy. The noon close was 954.8 yuan, with goods auctioned at 4 yuan, and the closing price was flat to slightly higher. The highest price for the half-day was 964 yuan, and the lowest price was 954.1 yuan, a difference of 9.9 yuan. As a result, the closing price fell 3.3 yuan from the previous close.</p>
<p>The settlement price was 34.875 yuan based on HSBC's US dollar exchange rate narrowing by 0.125, corresponding to a gold price of over 992 yuan. Based on the closing price, the deduction was approximately 37 yuan and change, an increase of about 7 yuan from the previous close. The registered prices for this month were 961 yuan, September 957 yuan, and October 955 yuan. The morning water supplement was 961 yuan. The red gold price was approximately 973 yuan, about 11 yuan higher, due to the rising gold price, which lowered the water supplement. Tianjin gang sold over one thousand taels of 99.3% fineness to Dadecheng Yingfeng Heng, adding 13 yuan. After entering, the gold market declined, and the Tianjin gang returned to cover, priced at 14 yuan. There was a lack of swap transactions, with buyers willing to swap out at 1.5 yuan, but there were no transactions. It was rumored that the Central Bank released 105 bars of spot at 958 yuan, slightly weaker than the futures price by approximately 2 yuan. There were still 21 bars left for this month, with Fuchang on the buying side and Dafeng Heng on the selling side.</p>
<p>Trading within the market was chaotic, with selling pressure being stronger. In summary, Shunli Wanxing Dingkang Yifeng Yong Dingtai Shenkang Dingchang Zaidecheng Yuqing Yong Heng Yu Hengtai Yongde Tongchun Yiyu Yicheng Tianfeng Fu'an Yuanmao Yong Senchang Yong et al. were on the selling side, while Daxing Yong Yongfeng Zhaofeng Chang Fuxing Yong Futaiheng Huixiang Xianghe Dafa Yong Yuanchang Yong Tianfeng Yong et al. were on the buying side. Zhaofeng Chang Zhengchang Qingyu Dachang Xiang first advanced and then retreated, and Dafa Yong Fuyu first retreated and then advanced. The Dalian gang Shunli together made slightly less than 1,500 taels, netting out over 500 taels. Wanxing together made over 1,900 taels, netting out over 200 taels. The Guang gang Shengda Hengxing did not have many transactions. The total number of transactions for the day was 48,587 taels.</p>
<p>For September futures that had not yet been settled, the buyers included Yifeng Yong with over 400 taels, Yuansheng Yong and Yiyu with over 300 taels each, Fuyu Huiyuan Dadecheng Yuanmao Yong with over 200 taels each, and Hongxing Yong with over 100 taels. The sellers included Heng Yu with over 900 taels, Fuchang with over 800 taels, and Ganchang Xiang Yuanheng Runchang Yong with over 100 taels each. The total number was 2,387 taels, with 14 long positions and 9 short positions.</p>

Later, the HSBC exchange rates were announced, showing flat for the British pound and only a narrowing of 0.125 for the US dollar, causing disappointment. The banks continued to sell, while the Chinese merchants' momentum waned, and buying interest suddenly ceased. The process gradually hardened. American gold continued to be shipped to Paris. There was some fluctuation midway, but the trend was difficult to reverse, with supply exceeding demand. The situation was loosest at noon. The noon closing prices for near-term sales were 1 shilling, 4 pence, 0.06875 for the British pound and 35.325 yuan for the US dollar. Compared to the previous close, the British pound was flat, while the US dollar loosened by 0.01875. December British-American exchange rates traded for 10,000, priced at 506.125. Banks such as Maijia Li, Citibank, Zhejiang, Huabi, and Jiaotong all had selling interest. Chinese merchants bought approximately 500,000 US dollars and slightly purchased British gold.

<h3 id="e212">Call Loan Rate Tight, Then Suddenly Eases <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>- Spot Silver Exports Slightly Moderate -</p>
<p>The market atmosphere in recent days has shown no signs of improvement for various commercial trends. The sudden rise in the call loan rate among foreign banks was attributed to excessive exports of spot silver, creating a shortage of spot funds in the market and causing public anxiety. Exports have indeed been significant. The government's recent increase in export tax rates has made exports unprofitable, leading to widespread inaction. As a result, the situation has eased, public sentiment has stabilized, and the call loan rate in the market has declined. Yesterday morning, both the morning and noon markets opened at 0.1 yuan, a sudden drop of 0.05 yuan from the previous day. The call loan rate plus water money was surprisingly loose, at 0.02-0.03 yuan, even free. The waterfront had ample funds, especially for call loans. It is expected that a general price increase is unlikely to occur again. Call loan transactions in the morning market amounted to over 3.4 million, with over 300,000 in new transactions. Transactions in the noon market were over 400,000. Transactions in the small general association were over 600,000. Pawn loan transactions, due to the return of silver funds, increased. Redemptions totaled over 900,000, while new loans amounted to 1.4-1.5 million. Banknote withdrawals were over 800,000, with issues of 1.4 million. Customer inflows were 150,000, and outflows were 300,000. Bank receipts: Foreign banks received nearly 3 million in bill receipts, 4.3-4.4 million in various goods, foreign exchange guarantee deposits, and miscellaneous receipts, over 1.2 million in foreign exchange settlement payments, over 500,000 in telegraphic transfer payments, and 600,000 in warehouse releases. Chinese banks received 2.6-2.7 million in bill receipts, 4.2-4.3 million in various goods, foreign exchange guarantee tax deposits, and miscellaneous receipts, 1.8-1.9 million in foreign exchange settlement payments, and 400,000 in warehouse releases. Japanese banks received over 2.1 million in bill receipts, 4.7-4.8 million in various goods and miscellaneous receipts, over 1.2 million in foreign exchange settlement payments, and 3 million in warehouse entries. Money shops received over 54.4 million in foreign public bills, 7.3-7.4 million in call loan payments, over 700,000 in various remittance payments, and 700,000-800,000 in cash receipts. Yesterday was a small contract day, so the receipt of foreign public bills was higher than usual.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the total exchange amount for the Shanghai Clearing House on the 25th was 8,975,999.54 silver dollars, including 3,465,433.77 silver dollars in cash and 5,510,565.77 silver dollars in clearing transfers.</p>

The afternoon market suddenly rose 2 yuan, reaching 837 yuan, and transactions also increased compared to the previous few days, with 3,000 jiao in the morning market and 12,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small silver was 740 yuan in the morning market, a drop of 0.5 yuan from the previous day. The afternoon market continued to decline by 1.3 yuan, reaching 738.5 yuan. As a result, the total decline for both markets was approximately 2 yuan. Transaction volume was 125,000 jiao in the morning market and 35,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins remained at 327,000 cash, with transactions of 27,795 strings, equivalent to 8,500 yuan in silver.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Securities - Bond Market Remains Chaotic <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>August Futures Were Last Day Yesterday</p>
<p>Crowded Longs Plunge Eight or Nine Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, being the last day for August futures, continued to be dominated by a short squeeze. The abundance of stock was due to an excessive number of overcrowded longs. Although the call loan rate had been reduced by 0.05 yuan, the market price did not rise as a result. On the contrary, when the call loan rate increased, the price fell sharply, indicating that the trend had completely deviated from the norm, with unpredictable fluctuations driven solely by supply and demand of stock. This was entirely caused by overcrowded longs. The future trend should return to normal. General sentiment remained bearish, but there were concerns about a potential rebound. Yesterday, trading continued in three sessions, and the market was quite chaotic. Due to different contract rollover arrangements, long and short positions exhibited different directions of price increases and decreases. The morning session initially showed weakness and lack of vitality. Later, the unified salt tax stabilized, and the short-term and long-term gold prices rose sharply by 0.8 yuan due to the large-scale absorption of the 32nd issue. Subsequently, they also rose by 0.3-0.4 yuan. In the second session, long and short positions rolled over, resulting in mixed price increases and decreases. The trend was already weak. In the afternoon, there was only one session, and the market price remained depressed, falling by 0.3-0.5-0.6 yuan. The market prices generally declined uniformly, ranging from 0.2-0.3 jiao to 0.8-0.9 jiao. Among them, only the Jiushan, the 23rd customs bond, and short-term and long-term gold prices rose by 0.3-0.5 jiao. The total transaction volume was approximately 25 million yuan. The price increases and decreases are listed separately below.</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that yesterday (24th) the New York stock market, although trading was very light, the market situation was actually trending upward. Pork prices continued to rise, benefiting canned food stocks significantly. It was generally believed that Lehman Malay's statement indicated the government's intention to grant some benefits to domestic railways, so railway stocks prospered. Utility stocks also made more progress than yesterday, as the revenue of major utility companies increased unexpectedly. Steel and brewing stocks followed the general trend. The recovery in purchases within the last hour of the small exchange caused the price of canned food stocks to rise. Bond prices were high and uneven. US government bonds were firm due to continued gold exports to continental Europe. Bonds issued by various companies followed the general market trend. Eastern purchases increased the value of corn, and other grains also rose in price. The total daily transaction volume was 750,000 shares. The Dow Jones Index is as follows:</p>

<p>Last Day for This Month's Yarn</p>
<p>Price Fell Below 80 Yuan</p>
<p>The yarn market is moving towards a softer path. With droughts occurring everywhere, the actual demand is becoming increasingly depressed. Furthermore, there are still no effective solutions for the yarn stored in the market's warehouses, and foreign firms' short positions remain unchanged, so the pressure remains high. However, the long positions in the financial sector are concentrated in the far-term contracts and have not given up, so the far-month situation still shows firmness. After this month's price broke below the 80 yuan mark, the long positions resisted and brought it back above 80 yuan. The final session was 181 yuan, 3 yuan higher than the July futures.</p>
<p>(Golden Rooster Down Another 0.8 Jiao) In the bidding for yarn in the morning market, the market sentiment was still good, and all months rose 0.2-0.3 yuan. When it came to the 2nd and 3rd sessions, new speculators sold, and a rift suddenly appeared in the market, with a sudden price drop. As a result, all months fell by 0.4, 0.6, 0.9 jiao to 1 yuan. In the afternoon market, this month was the last day, and the price broke below the 80 yuan mark, and the far-month also fell 0.2 jiao. It was flat at the 2nd session. At the close, because the long position of a certain company received the goods and did not release them, this month's price came back above 80 yuan, closing at 181 yuan. However, the far-month was flat. As a result, all months rose by 0.1-0.2 jiao. The total transaction statistics for the day were 54,200 bales. It was found that Dafu sold 3,700 bales, Yukang 700 bales, Huikang 650 bales, Yuande 1,200 bales, Shenyu 650 bales, Yuanyi 750 bales, Runkang 4,000 bales, Xiecheng 700 bales, Changyu 600 bales, Hengchang 2,150 bales, and Xincheng 800 bales.

<p>The cotton market began to fall and then rebounded, but the situation is more optimistic than the yarn market. Because the autumn drought has been severe recently, the cotton harvest may be greatly affected if it does not rain for a long time. As a result, long positions are actively buying, and there are fewer new sellers. However, Japanese firms are still selling when prices rise. What will happen to the future of the cotton market still depends on the weather. The closing price for this month was 34.5 yuan, 1 yuan lower than July.</p>

<p>In the bidding for cotton in the morning market, because American cotton rose 10 points, market sentiment was still strong, and all months rose another 0.05 yuan. Unexpectedly, when it came to the 2nd session, a large firm suddenly sold, and the price fell sharply. The closing price was also weak. As a result, all months fell 0.2-0.3 jiao. In the afternoon, there were fewer sellers in the market. Because the weather was too dry, cotton trees in all areas were in danger of withering, and market sentiment turned positive. All months rose another 0.15 yuan. The total transaction statistics for the day were 145,000 dan. It was found that Yuanda sold 1,800 dan, Huikang 2,400 dan, Dafu 3,100 dan, Dafeng 1,500 dan, Jinchang 2,200 dan, Yuanyi 2,500 dan, Changfeng 2,600 dan, Runkang 2,800 dan, Xiesheng 1,500 dan, Changhe 7,800 dan, and Xincheng 1,400 dan.

<p>Futures Flour Initially Rose, Then Became Flat</p>
<p>Yesterday in the flour market, after the morning opening, the market for each month showed a pattern of initially rising and then becoming flat.  Quotations for foreign wheat were around 1-2 jiao higher for Chicago and slightly lower for Canadian wheat.  When the prices opened, sentiment remained high for both near and distant terms. The current month's opening price immediately rose to 6.5 jiao, and the prices for distant months also increased by 3-4 fen compared to the previous day.  During the second session, the prices for August, September, and October further increased by 1-2 fen compared to the opening prices due to strong buying interest from inland merchants and price increases by speculators in the market.  However, as the mills took advantage of this strong sentiment to gradually sell off positions, the volume was considerable.  Therefore, by the third session, the market softened and sentiment turned weak, leading to a decline.  After the afternoon opening, the market initially remained stable, but then trading sharply decreased due to scarce buyers.  The merchants showed little movement, while there was both buying and selling in futures, and the mills also slightly reduced their positions, causing the market to continue to weaken.  The current month saw particularly loose conditions because the mills did not replenish their stocks and the merchants did not withdraw their purchases.  As a result, the current month only improved by half a fen, while September decreased by 7.5 li, October improved by 1 fen, November improved by 2.5 li, December remained unchanged, and January improved by 1 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e222">The Quiet and Firm Futures Wheat <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday in the futures wheat market, after the morning opening, the market for each month unanimously showed a high and rising trend.  Quotations for foreign wheat from both Chicago and Canada had a difference of 1-2 jiao.  With the tension in the flour market the previous day and a lively market atmosphere, the asking prices for each month increased invisibly after the opening, improving by 7-9 fen compared to the closing prices of the previous day.  However, although the market appeared tight, trading was not very active, mainly because outside speculators were also hesitant to buy.  After the afternoon opening, the flour market softened from its high, and buying interest in each session became sluggish, falling back by 2-3 fen from the high prices of the morning session.  As a result, the current month improved by 4 fen, September improved by 5 fen, October improved by 7 fen, November improved by 6 fen, and December improved by 7 fen.  In the spot wheat market, because the standard has risen and rice prices have also been increasing, high-quality wheat has increased by 6-7 fen, while medium and lower quality wheat remained flat.  Shandong Xuzhou Guide wheat opened at 4 yuan and 7 fen, Bengbu wheat at 4 yuan and 5 fen, Yaowan wheat at 4 yuan and 1 fen, Daqiao wheat at 3 yuan and 9.5 jiao, Liuhe wheat at 3 yuan and 9.2 fen, Hankou wheat at 3 yuan and 6.8 fen, and lower quality wheat at 6.5 jiao.  Fuxin and Fufeng each purchased 10,000 bags.</p>

<p>May-June Delivery at 5 Yuan 7 Jiao 5 Fen</p>
<p>Saigon Futures Sold Over 50,000 Bags</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for foreign glutinous rice became even more active. Foreign rice was being bought competitively by trading houses and speculators, and the market became increasingly prosperous. Current speculators of foreign rice are unwilling to sell, and new arrivals still require a slight wait. The total transaction volume for the entire day was less than 3,000 bags, with small broken rice accounting for over 2,000. Prices increased by 1-2 jiao. There was active trading in futures, with many transactions occurring between foreign merchants, rice merchants, and speculators. Yesterday, the total transaction volume in the unified market exceeded 50,000 bags, and rice merchants sold over 20,000 bags. The total transaction volume was over 70,000 bags (equivalent to over 7,000 tons), including 1,500 tons of Saigon rice in transit, 3,500 tons of September-October futures, and 2,000 tons of small broken rice for March-April delivery. Prices increased by 7-8 fen to 1.5 jiao compared to the previous session (all based on 100 jin). Saigon rice in transit was priced at 11 yuan and 8 jiao 4 fen per shi, and September-October futures had already risen to 5 yuan and 7 jiao 5 fen (per 100 jin). The November futures opened at 5 yuan and 6 jiao 5 fen in the morning and rose to 5 yuan and 8 jiao in the afternoon. The production area has been increasing in price, and sentiment is unanimously bullish, with many sellers unwilling to sell easily. Yesterday afternoon, Saigon telegraphed that both November and October futures required a price of 6 yuan, which, combined with shipping costs to Shanghai, would reach 12.5 yuan. Small broken rice is being supplied to India this year, and the production area is already high and there is no surplus for shipment to Shanghai. Therefore, while large quantities of Saigon rice were being transacted, small broken rice had not been seen in the market. Only yesterday was there a formal transaction (previous reports of 5,000 tons being offered were not accurate), with 2,000 tons being sold by Jinfaha and Heyi, all at a price of 5 yuan and 7 jiao 5 fen, for delivery in March-April of next year, and purchased by trading houses.</p>

<p>Yesterday, inland merchants actively sought out glutinous rice, and speculators on this street also showed interest. However, the arrivals were not abundant, and the market became even more attractive. Local merchants actively competed to buy rough glutinous rice. Over 2,000 bags of new arrivals were sold out completely, and there were also private negotiations for 4,000-5,000 bags of rice in transit. The positive market conditions were rare. New rough rice from Shashi also reached 9 yuan and 8 jiao 5 fen. The opening price for old rough rice from Shashi immediately reached 10 yuan and 4 jiao 5 fen, and the after-hours trading price reached 10 yuan and 7 jiao, an increase of 5-6 jiao compared to the previous close. Xiang rice requires a passport to be transported to Shanghai, and the daily arrivals have been low, so the price of polished rice from Jichang has reached 11 yuan and 7 jiao, polished rice from Qian reached 10 yuan and 6 jiao, rough rice reached 10 yuan and 3 jiao, and polished rice from Zhangzhou also reached 12 yuan and 2 jiao 5 fen, an increase of 2 jiao to 5-6 jiao compared to the previous day. A total of over 4,000 bags of polished rice were offered, it was said.</p>

<p>Rice Arrivals from Hexia are Scarce, Prices Increase by 2-3 Jiao</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, various sources continued to report drought. Only 13-14 boats arrived (totaling over 2,000 shi). Market sentiment was bullish, so despite limited sales, the prices of all types of rice increased. As a result, early rice such as regular Jiangsu-Tongzhou-Nangang rice and Qingjiao rice from Songjiang-Sishi-Xilian increased in price by 2-3 jiao. Duyang tip rice increased by over 1 jiao, and Yinbian rice also increased by about 1 jiao. Factory rice from Zhoupu, Pudong Xinchang also increased by 2 tian, opening at 12 yuan even.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 11-12 boats arrived from various sources in Hexia. The market continued to digest the rice, and sellers, due to high prices in the production area and drought conditions, were bullish, causing the price of white rice to increase by another 2 jiao, and the prices of thin rice, white yuan rice, and various tip rice also followed, increasing by 2 jiao.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the first batch of 73 bags of Jiujiang Zhuxi soybeans arrived, with excellent quality. This type of soybean is inherently more expensive than others, and due to the strong market, it fetched a good price, opening at 4 yuan and 9 jiao, and was purchased by traders on this street. The second batch of 102 bags of Duchang soybeans arrived, priced at 4 yuan and 6 jiao, an increase of 1 jiao compared to the first batch. High-quality Chenmen soybeans were scarce, and the market was quite attractive, with a firm and stable trend in Zhongguan. Over 300 bags were offered yesterday, priced at 4 yuan 3 jiao 6 to 3 jiao. A total of over 1,500 bags of early yellow soybeans from Hankou were traded, priced at 3 yuan 9 jiao 8 to 8 jiao 8, an increase of 4-5 fen compared to the previous session. The destination was inland and traders on this street. Due to a lack of actual sales, the price of old soybeans was stable externally but weak internally. New white sesame from Yangzhou continued to be offered at 7 yuan, with the original transaction of 36 bags. The market condition was characterized by few arrivals and stable prices, it was said.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market showed a softening trend due to little fluctuation in customs gold. The association's designated price for No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar spot goods was unchanged, with delivery at the wharf at 19 yuan and 8 jiao 2 fen, with some transactions, slightly looser than the previous day.

<p>— Shen Minxing</p>
<p>Among the children, surely some will ask upon seeing the title: "What exactly is common sense?"</p>
<p>Indeed, now I can tell you, common sense is a kind of general knowledge. Its scope is very broad. It is what we humans use to solve all ordinary things and problems in daily life, creating a sound life.</p>
<p>Many people say, "Humans are rational creatures." It can be seen that humans and knowledge cannot be separated. Everything in life depends on knowledge to succeed. A person without abundant knowledge will fail at most things.</p>
<p>Common sense is the entirety of knowledge, the only difference being that it is "broad but not specialized." Therefore, a person lacking common sense will certainly not have a perfect life.</p>
<p>Children, do you want to be a healthy and perfect person? Then you cannot lack common sense. No matter where, no matter when, no matter what happens, as long as common sense exists, you must use sharp eyes to recognize all kinds of new things, creating many new careers. That is so gratifying!</p>
<p>Among children, common sense is undoubtedly the best tool for creating a healthy life, and it is also the most abundant spiritual food!</p>

<p>— Hanyu</p>
<p>General Hindenburg unfortunately died.</p>
<p>He was the president of Germany, and also a famous general. He could drive out the enemies who invaded his country, and could defend his own land, never losing it.</p>
<p>In the third year of the Republic of China (1914 AD), a great war broke out in Europe. One side was the German and Austrian countries, and the other side was the English, French, and Russian countries. Russia had already invaded several provinces of Germany. At that time, there was a general in Germany who could drive the Russian army out of German territory. This was General Hindenburg.</p>
<p>At the end of the European War, countries around the world went to attack Germany. Of course, although Germany was strong, it could not deal with all the countries in the world. So Germany was failing steadily. But there was a general who guarded his battlements. Until the armistice, no country was able to break through him. This was also General Hindenburg.</p>
<p>General Hindenburg had patriotic enthusiasm, strong will, and great courage. He was a German national hero. We should commemorate him, emulate him, so that China can also have Hindenburg-like figures emerge to drive away our enemies!</p>

<p>— Zheng</p>
<p>Smart children! You read and write under electric lights every night, how convenient. You should know what an electric light is. How does an electric light emit light?</p>
<p>There is no air inside the bulb of an electric light. How is there no air? It is removed using a special machine that removes air, so some people call it a vacuum.</p>
<p>In the upper part of the bulb, there is a thick piece of glass. Inside the glass are two thicker wires, which are called platinum wires. In the lower part of the bulb, there is a very long carbon filament, which hangs in the middle on a glass pillar like waves. The carbon filament is connected to the platinum wires.</p>
<p>When the electric current passes from the platinum wires to the carbon filament, great resistance occurs. With resistance, light is emitted. If tungsten wire is used instead of carbon filament, the light emitted will be stronger, because the resistance of tungsten wire is greater than that of carbon filament.</p>
<p>The nature of electric current is very dangerous. Touching electric current can cause electric shock and death.</p>
<p>So please pay special attention, children: the switches and plugs of electric lights are very scary and must not be played with.</p>

<p>The long summer vacation of more than a month is really boring. Mom keeps urging Wen'er to review his books, and Wen'er agrees in his mouth, but in his heart he is 120% uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, this day classmate Xiang'er came to ask him to rent some books to read, and Wen'er thought of setting up a tiny library. Xiang'er agreed, so they went separately to ask the children in the alley and some nearby classmates to participate. The conditions for participation were: write your name on all the books you own and hand them in. They will be returned when the library closes. The benefit is: you can come to Wen'er's house at any time every day to read books.</p>
<p>This day the tiny library opened. Wen'er arranged the books that the members had handed in, read, and looked at, Children, Children's World..., and numbered them and wrote a catalog and posted it on the wall. Everyone elected Wen'er as the president and Xiang'er as the vice president. So from this day on, many people read books. He reads your book, you read other people's books. Many children were introduced by members and brought books to join, and the library became more and more lively, and they also met many new friends and gained a lot of new knowledge during this summer vacation. If they didn't understand something, they asked Wen'er. If Wen'er didn't understand, he asked the public. If anyone knew, they would announce it.</p>
<p>Children, are you willing to organize one? Just invite some nearby children, everyone take out their books, and learn from the tiny library, how beneficial it is!</p>

<p>— Composed by Quanpei</p>
<p>(1) The clown said to the four children: There is a cave down the mountain behind us. I want to go in and see what's inside. Do you want to go? (2) Everyone said they were very happy to go and see what was inside. Unexpectedly, as soon as they got to the entrance of the cave, they heard a "peng peng" sound, and everyone was very strange. (3) After a while, the "peng peng" sound became louder and louder, and everyone was extremely frightened, looking like they were about to cry, so they all turned around and ran away. (4) When they turned back, they saw that it was a naughty crab playing the drum. It had already crawled out of the cave, and everyone liked it.</p>

<p>— Shi</p>
<p>Mr. Cow finished working in the field, brought back a body of mud, dragged his heavy steps, and slowly walked back. He saw his neighbor Mrs. Pig lying there leisurely, feeding the little pig affectionately. Mr. Cow felt a little unfair in his heart. He thought: I am exactly the same as it, why should I work so hard every day? Leaving in the morning and returning at night, exchanging strength for sweat, exchanging strength for mud, but it only eats and sleeps, growing so fat. So Mr. Cow shouted:</p>
<p>"Lazy good-for-nothing who only eats!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Pig felt that someone was scolding it, so she jumped up and replied:</p>
<p>"What about you?"</p>
<p>"Our generations of descendants have to work before eating. If you don't work, you don't get to eat. Everyone works hard to cultivate, and then they get to eat. There is absolutely no reason to sit and eat." Mr. Cow said sternly.</p>
<p>"You're the stupid one. Our master sends food twice a day. We never work and we get to eat. How happy is this kind of life? You work, eating cold wind in winter and basking in the sun in summer, and you eat the same as us. Isn't this just making trouble for yourself?" Mrs. Pig said triumphantly.</p>
<p>Mr. Cow and Mrs. Pig had a quarrel, but it still didn't lead to any results. Mr. Cow only felt that he was too hard-working.</p>
<p>Later, the New Year came, and the master wanted to use pork to host a banquet, so he killed Mrs. Pig. Mr. Cow rested comfortably for more than ten days during the New Year.</p>

<p>The bright red pomegranate flowers have withered, but they leave behind one fruit after another, hanging in the middle of the branches. Under this pomegranate tree is a pile of grass, and ants often walk back and forth in the grass.</p>
<p>One day, a centipede was resting there. The ants were busy looking for food. A small ant happened to pass by and suddenly saw such a large amount of food. It was very happy in its heart, so it went back to the cave to report.</p>
<p>After a while, many ants lined up and walked straight towards the centipede. After a while, just as they were about to prepare to carry the centipede away, the centipede woke up. In its great anger, it used all its strength to deal with the ants, and soon beat them into disarray. Later, because there were more and more ants, they bit it to death, and everyone happily carried the centipede back to the cave.</p>
<p>I feel that those ants were able to bite the strong enemy to death because they had the power of unity. We Chinese people must also learn from the ants, have the power of unity, and jointly deal with the enemy, so that we can not be bullied by them!</p>
<h3 id="e238">Why Do Dogs Stick Their Tongues Out in the Summer? <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Qiu Yiting, a fifth-grade student at Shanghai Qianye Elementary School</p>
<p>In the summer, we often see dogs sticking out their tongues. What is the reason for this? Please think about it, everyone!</p>
<p>In general, everything can be studied: we children should especially have an interest in research, like the British inventor Watt, when he was a child, saw the pot lid moving and thought there was an old man with white hair in the pot who was about to jump out. Later, he studied carefully and discovered that the power of steam was very strong, so he invented the steam engine. Now ships, trains, etc., are all derived from Watt's invention.</p>
<p>There is also value in researching why dogs stick out their tongues in the summer. I know the dog's physiology. There are many sweat pores on its tongue, and sweat flows out of the sweat pores, so it has to stick out its tongue. Because its whole body is covered with hair, if the sweat flows out of the skin, won't the hair get wet and sticky? So it has to flow out of the tongue. For example, people also have many sweat pores on their skin, and sweat flows out on the skin, so there is a lot of sweat on the skin in the summer.</p>

<p>— Ruoxu</p>
<p>During the summer vacation, in addition to reviewing old books every day to avoid neglecting his studies, Zhifang's father also prescribed a lesson on "Sunday Science Talks," which was taught by his brother every Sunday morning.</p>
<p>On that Sunday, his brother took out a thermos bottle and said:</p>
<p>"There are three methods of heat transfer: one is "conduction," and the other two are "convection" and "radiation." If we hold one end of a wire and put the other end in a fire, our hands gradually feel the heat. This is the heat transmitted by "conduction." If we fill a cup with water and burn the bottom of the cup with fire, we see small bubbles floating up and down (adding some tea leaves to the water will make it even clearer). After a while, the water at the top of the cup also gets hot. This is the heat transmitted by "convection." When we are in the sun or near a stove, we feel hot, which is because "radiation" sends the heat of the sun or the heat of the stove to our bodies."</p>
<p>"The inside of the thermos bottle," said his brother, pointing to the thermos bottle in his hand, "is made of two layers of glass, and there is no air between the glass layers, and a layer of shiny material is applied. Such an arrangement can prevent the three methods of heat transfer, "conduction," "convection," and "radiation," from existing, so if hot things are put inside, the heat will not spread out, and if cold things are put inside, the heat from the outside will not run in to melt it. Therefore, thermos bottles can keep things hot or cold. As for the outer iron shell, it is only used to protect the glass inner lining inside."</p>
<h3 id="e240">Animal Bathing <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— (Zhushu)</p>
<p>In the summer, don't children often want to avoid bathing? Some children may wonder: why do humans need to bathe, but animals don't?</p>
<p>Let me tell you! Animals also like to bathe. Don't you see the birds in cages often dip their heads into the water and then pull them out? This is their bath. Even cats sometimes stroke their faces with their paws a few times, and dogs also like to raise their hind legs to remove dirt from their bodies. As for horses and donkeys, they roll around on the ground every time they are tired to show that they want to get rid of the fatigue of their muscles and bones, just like humans rubbing a towel on their bodies when bathing, wanting to get rid of fatigue.</p>
<p>Speaking of pigs, they couldn't be dirtier. But they like cleanliness, and they often doze and roll around in the water, as if they couldn't be more comfortable. As for the most obvious animals, such as water buffalo, they are more like friends with water.</p>
<p>Children! Do you like to bathe? Maybe you envy animals for not bathing all day, how carefree! But after you read the paragraph above, what do you think? Don't be greedy for playing anymore, go clean your body!</p>

<p>Lotus Flowers Are Blooming</p>
<p>Dear Children:</p>
<p>The clear fragrance, with the breeze, is sent from the pond to the tip of your nose. Every morning, run to this pond to receive this clear fragrance. Take a deep breath and relieve the depressed mind.</p>
<p>Sitting cross-legged on the ground in the sieve shadow of the willows. The lotus leaves are like plates, with many water droplets on them, rolling around; in an instant, many small beads turn into a shiny one; after a while, they turn into small grains again.</p>
<p>Toads and frogs take the tian tian lotus leaves as cradles, sitting freely in them. When they are happy, they also beat on small membranous drums, making a noise all over the pond.</p>
<p>White and light red lotus flowers emerge from the green leaves, elegant and fragrant, showing their noble character. It is as if they have been baptized by the New Life Movement. We children should be intoxicated in its arms.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, each stamen of a plant can only bloom one flower; but there are exceptions. Lotus flowers sometimes bloom two or three flowers on one stem, forming a lotus pod, which is called "twin lotus," symbolizing the love of husband and wife.</p>
<p>The lotus pod is like a honeycomb; in each room, a lotus seed can be peeled out, which is very delicious. So we went to pick them.</p>

<p>— Bingyu</p>
<p>Question: "Why can a very heavy steamship float on the water and not sink?" Answer: "Let's look at an empty tin can from canned food. If you throw it into the water, does it float?" This question and answer were discussed between Wilson, the young owner of an iron shop in England, and his friend. Wilson said, "Iron ships can float on the water." The friend said, "Why does a piece of iron sink when you put it in the water?" Wilson, coming from an iron shop, used light iron plates to build a ship, 20 meters long and 1.5 meters wide, unlike the wooden ships of the past. Later, this ship lasted for seventy years. Since Wilson created iron ships that could float on water, imitators increased day by day. In 1820, Mengpi used an 80-horsepower steam engine to build an iron ship 40 meters long and 6 meters wide. After that, it was recognized that iron ships were stronger than wooden ships and would not sink. But what is the reason for floating on the water? I will explain it with buoyancy. For example, if you put a one-pound stone into the water, the weight of the stone is reduced by one pound due to the displacement of water. If you put part of the stone into the water, the submerged part is also reduced in weight by the same amount due to the pressure of the water. This principle was discovered by the Englishman Archimedes, which is the so-called effect of buoyancy. Because when a stone is put into the water, the stone is subjected to pressure from all directions, up, down, left, and right. The pressure from the left and right is the same, but the pressure from the top and bottom is different. That is, the upward force from below is stronger than the weight of the water displaced by the stone. Therefore, anything that can float on the water is due to the effect of buoyancy. Because the weight of the object is lighter than the weight of the same volume of water, the weight is smaller than the buoyancy, and it will naturally float. The displacement of a steamship or warship is lighter than the steamship or warship itself, so it will naturally not sink. In other words, the total weight of the steamship (including cargo, passengers, and everything else), compared to the weight of the same volume of water, is lighter, so it floats. Therefore, when building steamships of tens of millions of tons, the amount of water displaced by the ship must be calculated first to determine how much weight can be loaded.</p>

<h3 id="e243">On Order and Life <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Antian</p>
<p>What is order? Before discussing this topic, we must first give a simple definition. Order is having hierarchy and no chaos. In other words, it is a perfect set of rules that we, as living humans, need when handling our daily lives, so that it does not become reversed or inappropriate. From this, it can be seen that order is related to life—for people in any class.</p>
<p>At first glance, order is just two ordinary words that can be seen and heard everywhere, as common as eating and talking. However, we must not ignore it just because it is ordinary. I believe that if you discard this misconception and treat it like a newly invented thing, and put some effort into studying it, it will bring you great benefits; even the smallest condition can make you feel that things are going smoothly and that time is being saved. If you are someone who has paid attention to order, then you must be very familiar with these and feel that what I am saying is not false.</p>
<p>In the past, the person who understood the word order most thoroughly was probably Xiao E. He once said something very good about order: "When he gets up in the morning, he plans a way to handle the day, and then follows this order to do it; in this way, it is as if the person is holding a guide wire. Because only by following this wire can it lead you out of this maze of busyness. If a person can manage time in an orderly manner, then that person will have a ray of light in all undertakings; if there is no plan for order before doing things, it is just wasting time groping blindly. In this way, all kinds of difficulties will inevitably arise, and the clues will be complicated, making it difficult to control and even more difficult to inspect." McCauley also said: "Without method, no matter how good the undertaking, it will be difficult to succeed." When Webster edited his dictionary, it took him thirty-six years, but he later said to people: "My method and order have saved me at least ten or twenty years of time, and spared me a lot of worry and hard work." Judging from the words of the famous people above, having order in doing things is indeed a beneficial thing.</p>
<p>In fact, the benefits of this order are not limited to celebrities; they have the same great benefits for us. Here, we can give two examples at random. For example, in a large company, when there are many customers, if you don't follow the order to do things, in the end, you may give too much goods or collect too little money. Imagine! How annoyed you will feel at that time! Also, a housewife must have order if she wants to have a clean and lovely family. If not, if a guest comes, she will be busy wiping the table and sweeping the floor first, and then send someone to make tea and buy cigarettes when the guest is about to leave. How will this disorderly attitude of "sweeping the floor when the guest arrives and brewing tea when the guest leaves" make people feel the chaos of the family and the incompetence of the housewife! However, if we try to reverse this disorderly attitude, how comfortable will we feel!</p>
<p>Speaking of the development of this orderly attitude, it is naturally not something that can be learned in a day or two. It requires training in daily life, and it also requires using the brain to understand the importance and unimportance of things, and then determine the order of doing things. If you add training in this way, and once it becomes a habit, there will be no difficulty.</p>
<p>In conclusion, although the two words order seem too ordinary, if you can use them properly, it can not only reduce the waste of time, the trouble of doing things inappropriately, and increase the effectiveness of doing things, but also receive praise from others for your orderly work and your capable and promising person, and receive respect from others. At the same time, the progress and success of your career may benefit from these two ordinary words "order."</p>

<p>— Kaihe, Wangli, Yixing County</p>
<p>It hasn't rained in Yixing for more than three months. The sun bakes in the sky like a fireball, and the intense heat evaporates the moisture deep in the ground. The weeds on the ground are withered and only a few thick roots remain; the sky is often filled with swarms of red dragonflies flying around in confusion. "Red dragonflies, flying in swarms; like red clouds, drought—drought—killing people!" The children sang while slapping bamboo branches.</p>
<p>There are unusually few pedestrians on the street. Only a group of shirtless people are piled up opposite the "Le Ye" tea shop, looking up and tiptoeing to look at the yellow paper and black characters posted on the wall. Some people are very serious about reading it out word by word:</p>
<p>"It is hereby decided that starting from the 13th of this month (i.e., June 2nd of the lunar calendar), the digging of the Wu River will commence. All workers must bring hoes, iron shovels, and other tools to the township office to collect work permits before 5:00 a.m. when the gong is sounded as a signal. This announcement.</p>
<p>Yixing Tang Zhuang Township Xueqiao Township Office"</p>
<p>The Wu River surrounding Tang Town—this is the widest river in the countryside, and it is also the main river that bears the dual mission of transportation and irrigation. The water from seventy-two mountain streams converges here to discharge, and the downstream flows into Yixing's famous "West Jiu" and then into Taihu Lake. It is not easy to dry up under normal drought conditions. On the contrary, if there are four or five inches of torrential rain during the plum rain season, it will flood because it cannot be discharged in time, washing away the thatched sheds. Now, under the most severe drought in the past sixty or seventy years, some parts of this river have cracks like turtle shells, and people are walking around in the riverbed. There are still a few places with stagnant water, but they are like the old phlegm in the throat of a consumptive patient, flowing sluggishly, telling people that this flow will not last long.</p>
<p>Since the yellow paper notice was posted, the quiet and dull air in the town has been mixed with noisy shouts for the past two days.</p>
<p>"The river is being dug! The river is being dug!" Ignorant children sang happily like ballads.</p>
<p>Most of the old women expressed a kind of sad complaint: People don't even have food to eat, so what are they digging the river for! The county has issued so much money for digging the river, it could also be used to save us poor people. If we are sincere and go to the "Meng Jiang Temple" to pray and burn more incense, that will be enough. The Bodhisattva is efficacious, and it will always rain.</p>
<p>The old farmers frowned with deep sorrow and just sighed there. They seemed to feel a kind of half-dead weariness towards this past life, and they did not have the courage to make a clearer imagination about the new life in the future. Sometimes, they even thought about "People's hearts are so cunning that there has been either drought or flood for years. If Heaven wants to destroy people, how can people be saved?"</p>
<p>Watching the withered crops, their hearts were boiling like oil pots, and they were so anxious that they had nowhere to go. Generally, those who rely on short-term work and busy work for a living have the strength but no place to sell it, so they have to lie softly on the bed with empty stomachs. Even if there is a little wheat left over from silkworms hidden in the jar (during the silkworm season, green wheat is mortgaged at a very low price for mulberry leaves to feed the silkworms; later, the silkworms were not raised, or they were raised but could not be sold at a price, so some wheat was completely eaten by the silkworms), such a drought would make life a problem. Some were so anxious that they had no choice but to start staging tragic scenes of the whole family committing suicide.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 13th, the urgent sound of gongs, clang, clang, clang, urged groups of farmers to go to the front of the township office. They squeezed together in an open space, expecting the allocation of work, and stretched their necks, looking at the closed gate of the township office.</p>
<p>The door opened with a creak, and they crowded forward a little more. What particularly caught their attention was the work permit made of white bamboo cloth and the self-ringing clock hanging on the wall indicating 5:30, because they were afraid that they would not receive the work permit if they were late.</p>
<p>Dang...dang, it was exactly six o'clock: there were still many farmers left in the yard.</p>
<p>"Those who have not received a work permit, come earlier tomorrow!" The township head reported and went in according to the rules they had set—</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>One hundred and fifty people are full, and work starts at six o'clock.</p>
<p>Those who were squeezed out of the work circle burst into a riot in the flickering of the morning light, but who cared? After a while, they could only disperse in frustration.</p>
<p>In a wide and long riverbed, white lime lines have been drawn, dividing it into blocks. They took off their clothes and found their positions one by one; one person took a hoe and a basket to dig the soil, and another person transported the dug-out soil and poured it on both sides of the river bank. In the cool morning, the work was very vigorous. Soon, the wet soil had piled up on both sides of the river.</p>
<p>The heat of the sun pressed directly on the ground. The low-lying river ditch was filled with more than one hundred and fifty naked, purple-copper-skinned farmers, each bending over and gritting their teeth, digging at the solid mud that had been pressed by the water. The pearl-like sweat, the rapid breathing, the skin that gradually turned from black to purple, contrasted with the swinging hoes and the bright iron chisels, all presented an exhibition of "human flesh" and "strength."</p>
<p>At this time, a thin layer of turbid mud in the riverbed, clumps of residual algae, and many dead small fish and shrimp were fermented by the sun, constantly emitting a foul odor. Most of the supervisors had already fled. They were suffocated and could not breathe, so they had to run to the willow trees by the river, stretch their sore backs; but the mischievous hairy caterpillars on the trees would give them a hot and itchy pain. Some simply sat on the handle of their hoes or iron shovels, braving the heat of the sun, smoking yellow cigarettes, and clearing the stuffiness accumulated in their chests.</p>
<p>But such rest would be reported. At that time, the supervisors would run over with a stern face, and they would have to return to the oil pot-like riverbed one by one. Some were so hot that they had no choice but to roll around in the mud.</p>
<p>The sweat on their bodies was almost gone. The dryness of the throat and the hunger of the body forced them to grab the clear well water carried by passers-by to drink. In summer, they would not have so much tea to drink, and well water became the most common natural drink in the countryside.</p>
<p>When they saw someone dig up a bottle or a fishing fork that had fallen into the water from a fishing boat, many lines of sight would immediately focus on it; everyone fantasized that there would be these things or more valuable gold, silver, pearls, and treasures under the hoe, so sometimes they would work even more excitedly. However, such fantasies would fade away like the sun and eventually disappoint them.</p>
<p>The sound of the gong, clang, clang, clang, rang out with the setting sun, announcing that the day's work was over. So they dragged their tired bodies, carrying their heavy tools, and scattered home, while each one thought in their heart: "Today, I earned fifteen copper coins!"</p>

<h3 id="e245">Private Tutor <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Zhengping</p>
<p>The position of a private tutor can hardly be considered a favorable one. This is not only because the salary is meager and insignificant, but also because the profession itself is unstable and insecure. A private tutor is mostly hired temporarily or for a short period. Even while in employment, they cannot avoid constantly feeling the threat of renewed unemployment. We know that most middle- and upper-class families hire private tutors to tutor their children in various major subjects in order to facilitate entrance exams or increase essential knowledge and have their needs. In such cases, the period specified on a private tutor's employment contract is probably only about three months. Some students who fail to enter school during the winter and summer vacations for various reasons, in order to facilitate their future schooling, also specifically hire a private tutor to tutor them in various important subjects. In such cases, the period of service is usually no more than ten months, or only four or five months at least. Naturally, there are also parents who particularly trust private tutors and employ them for longer periods, but such things are extremely rare.</p>
<p>Although the life of a private tutor is even more difficult than that of an ordinary school teacher, the number of people who long to obtain such a position is still countless. Of course, there are many people who are satisfied with obtaining such a position after receiving a diploma from a normal school or high school without obtaining corresponding knowledge. Even university graduates with "specialized knowledge" (?), In today's world where only one out of ten people can find a job, they also have to reach out to this insignificant position. Unemployed primary and secondary school teachers, as well as those who are engaged in the occupation of private tutors and are now idle, must also pay attention to this valuable position. The widespread unemployment of intellectuals has led to a widespread surplus of people who regard being a private tutor as a great hope.</p>
<p>Speaking of the remuneration of private tutors, I have a need to further mention their possible monthly income. This naturally has different numbers: the income can differ by tens or even hundreds of yuan, ranging from "salary not counted" to the more considerable income of those who have special introductions. Apart from warlords, bureaucratic politicians, big merchants, and compradors who are willing to pay heavy sums of more than one hundred yuan to hire full-time private tutors for their young masters and young ladies, the remuneration for a private tutor with teaching experience and good qualifications in ordinary middle- and upper-class families generally does not exceed fifty yuan a month. Last winter, a university graduate friend was hired by a doctor at a hospital affiliated with a certain coal mining company in Henan to tutor his own two children and the two children of his colleagues in Chinese, English, and mathematics, and he was still paid a monthly salary of fifty yuan. He also sent the invited teacher a travel allowance of twenty yuan. Another friend who graduated from the Department of Education of the University lost his teaching position in a certain middle school in another city. When he returned to Shanghai, thanks to the introduction of a friend, he immediately went to a certain mansion to impart his knowledge at the price of serving three hours a day and a monthly salary of forty yuan. The above is about male private tutors. As for female private tutors, it is even more affordable to sell their knowledge. There are also those who come out of universities and only hope to obtain this position for a small amount of thirty yuan, twenty-five yuan, twenty yuan, or even fifteen yuan a month, but they cannot get it. I have a female classmate who, after completing her third year of university, could not continue due to the lack of family economic ability and was forced to leave school to seek a living on her own. Because she was clever and capable, she simultaneously found two private tutor positions; she divided the two hours in the morning between one mansion and the two hours in the afternoon between another mansion. She was busy running around all day, spending three or four cents on trams and rickshaws every day, and her total income from the two places was only fifty yuan. I also know a lady who also came out of university. She once signed a three-month private tutor contract with a certain mansion in this city at a price of thirty yuan a month for three hours a day. There was also a friend's wife who declared that she was willing to sell the knowledge and labor that a private tutor could have for a monthly salary of fifteen yuan, but she did not get a buyer. We have the opportunity to see this kind of tragic fact fermented from this rotten society at any time.</p>
<p>Because private tutors must go to people's "homes" to teach, in order to save time and travel expenses, they (or she) need to move to live near the employer's mansion. This seems destined for them to constantly feel the burden of moving. Also, with a few exceptions, most employers rarely provide private tutors with both meals and accommodation; there are also those who only provide one meal. In this case, most of them must operate on their own. Because of the short-term and temporary nature of the occupation, their lives are naturally difficult to stabilize, so their greatest hope is to find a more stable occupation. A middle school teacher's position is probably their ideal goal, a primary school class teacher or subject teacher's position should also be very suitable for their appetite, and even an ordinary primary school teacher is considered a good position in their eyes. Most of their hopes are not easy to realize, so they are still unemployed most of the time.</p>
<p>In addition, there is another type of private tutor. They originally have a job. They may be a teacher in a primary or secondary school or a teacher in a night school or cram school. Because their income is not enough to maintain their lives, they must use their so-called "spare time" to grab a "side hustle" at people's mansions. It goes without saying how hard and busy these people are. I have a friend who teaches English in a certain middle school. In addition to teaching twelve hours a week, he also teaches six hours a week in a mansion. Every night, he also borrows a primary school to open a "special class" for employees and apprentices of some factories and shops to make up for English. Although his income is considerable, his hard work is not difficult for anyone to imagine.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to mention the difficulties that private tutors can encounter. We know that private tutors are hired to teach several major subjects such as Chinese, English, and mathematics. Most people may not be proficient in all of these subjects. If a flaw is revealed in the explanation of a certain subject, or if a satisfactory answer cannot be given immediately to a question raised, the student's disbelief caused by this will cause great problems in the subsequent teaching process. It goes without saying that the student will not listen, and the employer's distrust will also be inevitable. At this time, it is naturally difficult for the teacher to maintain it.</p>
<p>Also, there are often great differences in the age and academic level of children in a family: the "class teaching" system is not applicable here, and you have to carefully guide them one by one. Although the number of students may not be very large, the troubles caused by the uneven level will certainly not be few. At this time, you can only teach patiently, and you must hold back the fire in your heart, so as not to cause unhappiness in your occupation due to your impatience. The "mansion" is not a place where you can afford to be angry, and those young masters and young ladies will not willingly look at your face. At this time, it is best to settle the account with "society", I think.</p>

<h3 id="e246">What Movies We Need to See <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Bing Jia</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a so-called soft versus hard argument in the film industry. Proponents of the soft approach believe that the sole purpose of movies is to provide the audience with sensual entertainment. Therefore, films should be romantic, sensual, and comedic. Proponents of the hard approach believe that the ultimate purpose of movies is not only to entertain the audience but also to educate them, providing the audience with spiritual and intellectual nourishment. Therefore, films should be, and must be, realistic and content-rich. I am not a film theorist, and I do not want to criticize these two opinions. I only want to provide them with some reference material from the standpoint of an audience member. However, before getting to the main topic, I must mention the reason for this debate and its importance.</p>
<p>×　×　×　×</p>
<p>Because movies are the closest to the average common people, the effectiveness of movies is greater than that of all art forms. They not only give the audience a concept but also provide action and imagery. Therefore, as soon as they emerge, they become powerful supporters of special social classes. That is, special social classes use them as tools to control the thinking of the average common people. In China, although film art is more immature than in Europe and the United States, its development and function are no exception. Just look, hasn't it developed from "The Burning of the Red Lotus Temple" to "Laughable Marriages," and then to "Sister Flowers" and "Mr. Wang"?</p>
<p>However, society is not a simple and static thing, and the masses (the common people) are not a unified whole. No matter how you inject anesthetics, you cannot stop the progress of society, and you cannot catch everyone in one net, making the masses forever unconscious. Some people will escape from your anesthesia. This forms an irreconcilable contradiction in the development of film art (as with any art): one is the supporter of special classes, and the other is the sustenance required by the masses themselves. This is the fundamental reason for the soft and hard film debate.</p>
<p>Currently, the number of people who refuse to be unconscious is increasing day by day. Therefore, on the one hand, mass art has become the only art movement, occupying the entire art scene. On the other hand, supporters of the old era are bound to fight back with all their might, forming the development of the entire restoration movement. Last year, the film art movement surged for a time, revealing a new opportunity for the future of film and producing many mass films, although most of them did not have the opportunity to be released. This is bound to make those old-fashioned figures in the film industry feel uneasy. They will inevitably, under the wings of the entire restoration movement, and like the "Classical Chinese Revival" in the literary world, extend their paper-thin fists to launch a counterattack. The "soft" versus "hard" debate shows that the film movement is no longer a time for closed-door innovation, nor is it just a time for theoretical struggle, but a time for head-on clashes for survival.</p>
<p>×　×　×　×</p>
<p>So, what about us, standing in the position of the audience? What kind of movies do we need? Simply put, we need hard films and not soft films. We are in a difficult era, and our lives are extremely difficult. Of course, we desperately need entertainment and sensual comfort, but not as the proponents of the soft approach imagine, that as long as there are passionate hugs, kisses, and women's legs, we will be happy to the point of unconsciousness. No! Absolutely not! We need intellectual stimulation far more than we need physical stimulation. We want to laugh, but we don't laugh meaninglessly. We want to gain a little life function from movies before we laugh. All our educational opportunities and cultural nourishment have been completely deprived. Movies are a simple and clear way to increase our knowledge and life force. If we only treat them as entertainment, wouldn't we be cutting ourselves off from culture and starving ourselves to death? For example, the simultaneous release of "Song of the Fishermen" and "Mr. Wang" actually gave the proponents of the soft approach a merciless blow. The frivolous tunes of "Mr. Wang" ultimately could not defeat the ability of "Song of the Fishermen" to obtain a wide audience due to its life content. This is not forced, but our audience's actual demand.</p>
<p>I hope that movie audiences will judge the outcome of the soft and hard debate based on our actual demands!</p>

<h3 id="e247">New Children's Cultural Construction in the Soviet Union <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Yangzi from the Japanese work of Shigezaku Niijima</p>
<p>Where do these spirited, rosy-cheeked Soviet schoolchildren go after school? Do they go home? Do they go to their mothers? I don't think so. Because most Soviet children's parents are working in factories or institutions during the day (because there is no unemployment in the Soviet Union), and they go to training courses at night.</p>
<p>(1) For the Systematic Facilities of Children's Education</p>
<p>First, schools are devising methods for children's time outside of school. Second, adult cultural facilities are provided to children at certain times. All theaters hold special morning performances so that older children can appreciate magnificent dramas. Movie theaters also screen selected films specifically for children. Various workers' clubs are conducting activities among children. Cultural parks have special "children's villages," and general sports fields or swimming pools are open to these playful children at certain times. In addition, there is a network of various children's facilities, artistic children's education centers, children's theaters, children's movie theaters, technical labor practice centers or libraries, consultation offices for small trips or large trips, children's education clubs, etc.</p>
