<p>時評</p>
<h3>英法恊調之意義</h3>
<p>— 恒</p>
<p>據最近歐電。此次央法談話之範圍甚廣。唯主要問題不外三項。（一）爲東歐相互安全公約之訂立問題。（二）爲軍縮問題。（三）爲明年度之海軍會議問題聞談話結果。英國對於法俄之相互安全計劃。决守善意中立之態度。德國若能簽訂此種安全公約。則法國準備對德作軍備上之讓步。此訊而確則此後法國之駕馭德國。當可操縱自如。無復有多方顧慮之必要矣。</p>
<p>吾人當猶憶及上月軍縮會主幹會開會時。英法激烈衝突之事實。曾幾何時。兩國之融洽竟至於此。考其原因。則知英政府態度之轉變。實非偶然也。其最明顯者。如威尼斯德意兩雄之會談。意大利添造戰艦之决心。日本要求海軍平等之主張。皆爲箇中之關鍵。德意二雄會談而後。結果如何雖不可知。然合作之途徑已開。則無可疑。設德奥能捐棄新怨。重修舊好。形成意德奥匈之結合。則恢復德奥意三國同盟之舊規。正非難事。史載。一九零四年英法之携手與一九零七年英俄之交歡皆以針對德奥意三國同盟爲目的。今若德意之舊夢重溫。復返戰前之故途。則過去合縱連衡之局面。自不難再見於今日吾人雖謂英法之親交。乃爲預防德意同盟之復活。亦無不可。</p>
<p>今日德國實力未充。英人對之。疑忌較差。惟對意大利則不然。蓋英國屬地遍全球。而地中海爲其東西交通之孔道。設於此而有一强大海軍國家之阻</p>
<p>梗而此國家又有德奥匈爲之後盾。則其所加於大英帝國之威脅。方諸戰前之德帝國。未見多讓。故英國爲自衛計。實有與法恊調之必要。</p>
<p>五强海軍會議。本須明年開議，丁此歐洲多事之秋。暫行停頓。本無不可。乃英國先則有預開談話之請。繼則又毫無結果而止。意在探視日本之意旨。藉以確定自身之政策。殊爲明顯。英日之海軍主張。若能恊調。英人卽不必以聯法爲急需。無奈日本堅欲獨覇太平洋。不容他國挿足。英人實偪處此。不能不趨於親法之一途。蓋唯如是。始能藉法之助力。以應付歐局。一日變故發生。可以騰出海軍主力。與日本相周旋也。</p>
<p>故今次英法恊調之範圍。初不以歐洲片隅爲限。而兼及於遠東。言其　體影響第一。東歐互障公約成。則德日恊攻蘇俄之勢破。大戰可以延緩。第二。意德受英法與其同盟之包圍。雖欲結合。亦苦難以施展。第三。意大利之艦隊。旣受法國海軍之牽制。英國在大西洋與地中海之主力艦隊。有隨時移調遠東之可能。設英美合作。亦無波折。則在明年之海軍會議席上。儘可壓迫日本。卽華盛頓與倫敦兩海軍條約訂結後之遠東新局面。（如僞國問題等）成竟　至提出討論。亦未可知。此則又爲我國人所當深切注意者也。</p>

<p>（莫斯科）　蘇俄官塲中認此次法外長巴爾都訪英遊説之後、東洛迦諾條約之成立、似已成爲定局、但此種條約計劃之源始、以及如何努力促成之者、則應歸功於李維諾夫云、再則此處均信將來法國與蘇俄將以此種普遍民恊定之擔保者自任、而恊約之門户將任其開而不閉、以待前此拒絶參加者之自由加入云、眞理報對於日前德國國社黨首領赫斯氏在龔尼斯堡所發表之演説、認爲係「德國急速欲與外國成立諒解之表示、」因此之故、莫斯科方面已有極高之希望、或者德國將來亦將參加東洛迦諾條約云（十一日國民電）</p>
<h3>和平事業從此更進一步　法報公頌揚巴爾都功績</h3>

<p>（十一日國民社電）</p>
<p>（柏林）　德國報紙最近數日尚力言巴爾都之赴英、必無結果、乃自昨日英法談判大收功效之後、其態度忽然一變、現已一致宣稱、法外長大獲勝利、有若干報紙並謂巴爾都此次所得結果、超過法國原來希望、半官式之外交通信報、謂巴爾都主持外務以來、對於英國能採取一種因應時宜之良好策略、惟該報不以法國之東方洛迦諾條約政策爲然、謂此種政策、將使紅軍成爲國際政治上之重要因素、其言曰、「東西兩種洛迦諾條約之内外關係、將使中歐各國發生危險、而足以擾亂歐洲均勢、蓋德國與波蘭將成爲俄國軍隊進佔之土地、而布爾希維克主義、將由波蘭德國經過、向歡西大肆宣傳矣云云、</p>

<p>（巴黎）羅馬尼亞總理達大萊斯哥此次來法、就法羅恊商之本身言之、並無任何新意義、蓋兩國恊商之訂立、業已多年、不自今日始也、所可慶幸者、乃巴爾都甫由倫敦載譽歸來、而羅馬尼亞國王、加羅爾不久又將來法、達大萊斯哥適於此時翩然蒞止、此於法羅兩國合作之發展、實大有關係耳、（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

蛄是常常好與蚯蚓比隣而居的，螻蛄形如蝗蟲，能跳能飛；蚯蚓却是蠕行的，等我人循聲而往，螻蛄早飛走了，只剩下蚯蚓，所以大家有此誤會。國際新聞綱史話  上海通社　　　世界在你的家中|善鐘路霞飛路口的上海泰晤士報廣告牌上這樣的寫着。是的，當我們翻開每天報紙的國際版看時，豈不是隔昨的世界消息都聚到了家裏麽？在現代的時候，通訊的工具充分地運用着，傳播消息眞是容易不過的事。最近，國際無綫電話也和上海接通了，任憑你什麽地方有了事故發生，馬上可以通報。然而我們亦想到若干年前交通困難的時代，那些負收集與傳播消息的國際通訊社是戰勝了許障礙而發展來的故事麽？下面將述路透社在本巿活動的歷史和男昂上海間通報的珍聞。　　上海最早辦理國際新聞通訊社是英國的路透社。該社本部的創始，在一八五八年，而來華東方面的活動，則始於一八七一年，在上海設了一個代理部。這時候祇有字林報購用它的新聞稿，而該社的目的，是要搜集中國各地的消息供給於本部。當時海底電綫尚未接到吳淞，中國内部也没有安置陸綫。路透社於一八七一年三月嘗發一通啟，宣言該社擬接收中國各方的新聞消息，先由郵訊達新嘉坡，再以有綫電報轉發倫敦。通啟内并述及有一位格蘭脱君，做了許多貢獻很大的事，便是在上海搜集了新聞消息，由海路寄往天津，由天津經過很遠很危險的陸路送往西比利亞哈克圖的大北電報局，再用電報轉達歐洲。這樣，比較由蘇彝士河經過每月一次的歐亞航程，可以减少了若干時日，這種努力的精神顯然是令人佩服的。　　一八八三年，英國大東電報公司海綫展拉接至吳淞，并獲得登陸權，於是依照下列的綫程，上海就可以同歐洲直接通報了：　　吳淞至川石山|川石山至香港|香港經關島新嘉坡至歐洲。　　自此以後，歐洲的電報通訊，在上海當天就可以收到，至遲也不過隔了一天。路透社藉英國海綫的專權在上海保持了許多時候國際通訊的權威，直到歐戰將終時，才遇着法國無綫電的勁敵。（其間雖有德國大德和電報競爭，但能力是薄弱的）　　法京無綫電社嘗在上海法租界顧家宅（福履理路亞爾培路口）設無綫電臺，一九一八年，調電信專家博羅爾曼由廣州灣來滬主持該　。博氏將電機改良，增進接電的力量，於是該臺能接收六千餘英里以外的電信。當博氏布置剛完畢時，就接到法境美軍司令斐興將軍致華盛頓政府報告的電報。後來，博氏和巴黎議定，每天由里昂發電，傳至上海。發電時間，在歐洲爲夜間十時，而在上海則爲淸晨六時，因此，往往戰訊在歐洲未發表之前，就已傳到上海，於是上海人就能够和歐洲人同時讀到戰報。不久，休戰消息從無綫電傳來，久爲大戰所困的中外商人，是怎麽樣子的高興呢。　　歐戰時，路透電傳至上海約需三四日之久，　自然是不及法國的無綫電的，然而當時法通訊社並没有利用上海電臺來和路透競爭，不過將所收電訊作爲官報分送各報館而已。近來法國哈瓦斯社在本巿發稿，顧家宅電臺乃得到充分的應用了。通訊  火雲明　　陳師誠先生：因研計「嚴陵釣壇」在處問題，先生意氣甚盛。僕謂嚴陵山即富春山，而先生反對之。反對之而仍不能確認富春山在何處，何處即富春山；離問題中心，誠愈趨愈遠矣。「春秋」之拒刋我輩文章宜也。惟僕探討學術，輒好窮其究竟，先生果感興味，請擇日蒞僕處促膝晤談如何？地址民國路麫粉交易所圖書館。</h3>

<p>自由談旱象  沈聖時　　　|角蘇道中|　　從蘇州返故鄉的途中，在輪船中，我看了展開在六月的火太陽下旱象的田野了。轆轆轆···嘆息似的水車葉片捲帶着水流在嗚咽。　　水車的聯隊裝置在河岸上，相隔一二畝距離設着一架，盤轉那大車盤的很少見到牛，多數全是六七個農人胸間繫着繩子繞着車盤兒打轉，據説這里的農户很少再養着牛的，大都人家把那忠心於主人的畜生換了大洋送上田主還租了，縱使還留下一條乾瘦的老黃牛的，半月多繼續着在烈火似的炎陽下工作，乏啦！也有倒在草棚裏死了。　　牛没有了，農人自己還是要繼下去工作的，看吧！水車的聯隊全是農夫農婦們自己在繞着大車盤打水啦！　　柴草棚下，赤裸的鐵色的肩背，腿，曝在太陽陰下。　　他們她們沉重沉重的脚步，彎着腰背，一邊走，一邊喘息，汗流從肩背上滑下去。　　瞧瞧廣闊的田畦，濛濛的蒸騰着一股熱氣，太陽的大火舌頭，不容情地，舐進了幼嫩稻尖；田溝的水不住聚起泡沫，犯着渴水症的田泥，快速的把才車上的水全吸涸了。　　在幾個車水棚里，我看見草棚裏掛着一盞避風的煤油掛燈，從那種燈上你可想到當太陽爬下了山岡，黃昏燈影裏，他們還要繼續的工作；或是在東方未明時，他們也要趁着早凉的曉風，在燈光裏盤動那重大的水車盤。　　　　那種辛苦，那麽白天黑夜的繼續着，把收穫的希望背在水車盤上，千萬顆心渴望着雨水。　　但是向田畦裏瞧瞧吧！禾苗全是病弱的孩子似的，細瘦得可憐，還受得起炎陽的烤着嗎？　　輪船團了一個向，河岸全向側面倒退，水淺，把輪船擱住啦！船夫應有螺旋把輪的艄部用粗索子盤弔在拖船身上，像一隻翹起尾巴在水中覓食游泳的鴨子似的。　　大樹蔭下，一所石柱的茅亭裏，我瞧見有幾個年老的農夫，坐在亭子内地上，土色的臉相對着。　話着年勢的辛酸吧？　　　一九三四，七，八，　　　　　　于甫里。詩人心眼中的兒童生活  洞若　　在自由談上看見了曹聚仁先生的、「詩人心眼中的農民生活」覺得舊時代的詩人大多是帶着幻覺的；他們所見到的是美好，是夢幻，是無思無慮的田家樂！九斤老太村子上所起的風波，他們是不能知道的。　　通過了詩人的幻覺，一切都變做美好了。於是農民變做了像煞是世外桃源的隠士，而兒童也就變做神秘莫測的小天使了。「天眞爛縵」，「純潔無邪」，「活潑可愛」，似乎已經成了一套專供形容兒童的精神和態度的詞語；「童年」「童心」這等字眼已經和詩聯結一起，童年的回憶會使得詩人們發狂地迷戀，童心的消失會使得詩人惋惜，歎息。　　眞的每個兒童都像詩人們所想的那樣可愛，潔白和純眞麽？但是一個六歲的孩子已經知道怎樣去壓迫，騙取其他兒童的銅板，滿足他自己的食慾；一個僅有七歲的孩子已經學得了肯去帮助自己妹妹而同時對於其他的伴侶完全採着漠不關心的態度；馬路上那些拾垃圾的江北孩子因爲賭一塊木頭的輸贏而發生了糾纒不淸的武力衝突；學校裏的兒童因爲沒有錢購買課業用品或零食而發生偷竊；在有些兒童的秘密結社裏更可以窺到那所謂領袖對於弱小的專横，欺騙和壓迫||所有這些事實，也和九斤老太村子上所起的風波一樣是不爲詩人們所知道的。　　詩人們所見到的是特權者家裏的兒童，是度着充滿了愛情和遊戲有敎養的兒童。我們試想一個童工，當他長大的時候，他的童年的回憶能給予他什麽呢||除開了凍餓，疲乏　，羞辱。　　將某一部份的兒童理想化了，同時更將這理想賦予抽象的神秘的外衣，造出了一個似乎非人間的兒童，對於兒童和他所屬的家庭，社會的依存關係一點也不給予考察，這是詩人們最荒謬的處所。天眞無邪的兒童，貪婪强暴的兒童都一樣是客觀環境的產物。正因爲我們這社會上存在着可以發生欺騙，壓迫，偷竊的那種罪惡的社會體制，所以欺騙，壓迫和偷竊也都在兒童的隊伍裏獲得和成人們同樣的反應　　詩人們對兒童的理想化是虚妄的，我們放棄了產生壓迫，痛苦，虚僞，剝削的社會體制，在一個合理的社會下，我們不但會有全部天眞爛縵的兒童，我們也將有天眞爛縵無邪的成人！　　最後，我們必須指出，將兒童理想化這件事的本身上也有着牠的社會意義的。因爲兒童的頭腦單純樸素以及他們對於自然各社會的無知。在實社會裏飽經虚僞壓迫，繁雜，矛盾這些痛苦的生活而同時又設法擺脱的人們，結果只有倒轉過來羨赤子無知，單純和樸素了！　　老莊們之所以主張返樸歸眞，返到鷄犬之聲相聞，老死不相往來在他們認爲理想的原始共產社會去的，就因爲他們認爲在這個社會裏有着和兒童一樣的單純和樸素。作爲人生之一階段的兒童時期，在某種意義上説來正是相當於人類歷史原始共產社會這一個階段的呀！八股試題  大琨　　最近有人將各大學歷屆入學試題中的國文題目都搜集了攏來。我一數剛巧是　百個，這一百個國文題目可分析如下：　　（一）屬於申義策論體的占百分之四十七，其典型的代表是：「孫子謂百戰百勝，非戰之善有，不戰而屈人之　　兵，單之善者也，試申其義」，「秦始皇論」，「救國以何者爲先策」，「民維邦本説」。　　（二）屬於專門論文與國文可謂完全無關的，占百分之二十一，其典型的代表是：「黃河漲溢，堤壩損毁，潰决泛濫，在在堪虞，應如何修濬，方能防患未然？試各抒所見以對」。「金價漲跌的因果和中國經濟上的關係」，「廢兩改元聲中之防弊説」。　　屬於普通類的題目佔百分之十九，其代表是：「大學生應負之使命」「大學生爲學應具的精神」等，眞正屬於文藝上的題目，而或者可以用白話做的僅占百分之十三，如「路」「夜」「燈」之類。　　我這個分類其實是不十分完善的，因爲所謂「申議策論」體，「專門論文」以及「普通類」，在性質上其實都差不多，都是「八股」的變相，然而這樣的「八股試題」郤竟佔据了全體總題目的百分之八十七。　　這告訴我們的事實是：如今的「學究」　不但在强迫年青人讀「文言」，而且還在强迫年青人作「八股」。然而，試問：這樣的「八股文」，年青人又怎樣做得好呢？於是「學究們」慨嘆了，從而要加緊「文言運動」了，但那結果是我們可以預先知道的，那只有使得年青人的國文程度更加低落而已！　　現在是已經有人將「文言白話之爭」看作過去的「論爭」了。但至少就學校裏的國文科言，這「論爭」我認爲是還有强調的必要的。我們不能讓青年人儘吃苦，儘受騙，做起文章來一開口就永遠是那樣的「今夫天下」。南行小記（上）  星野　　三年没有坐京滬火車了，居然現在由南京到上海，省了我兩個鐘頭。我最愛聽火車的輪聲，在二等車上用眼釘在乎錶上，看秒針很鄭重的一滴一滴的走，聽鐵軌上磨着的車輪一圈圈的響。我快活嗎？不是！我興奮嗎？不是。我只覺得我在不可快活的情形裏，自己緊緊的在握著自己靈魂，不許他笑，也不許他哭；我只要自己像機關車一樣的循着鐵軌，用我熱烈的心靈，把自己像鐵輪一樣的向前推進。　　鐵的車輪，眞可愛，響鬧鬧的把我送到上海了。再也不去注意那浦東浦西的外國輪船，再也不去注意什麽海關，什麽外國銀行，只覺得這些傢伙自現在己與我絶緣，讓我忘記了這些。我現在己在中國。人家説中國是一個修羅塲，我却願意在修羅塲中轉一轉。同四年前一樣到很糟很鬧的十六鋪，同四年前一樣的和那鴉片吸得不够的水手們接洽，大輪船坐厭了坐小輪船。過了船齡幾十年的老招商船又帶我向南邊去　　遇到了一個猶太人。眞利害。赤熱的天所氣坐這樣的壞船到一個小城巿去挖金錢去。他説自己是紐約人，他對我宣傳猶太民族之偉大。他請我吃猶太酒，他對我解釋希伯來文明。我討厭他，我佩服他。我的確有偏見。我希望我們中國人也這樣到外國去撈錢。撈錢眞不是壞事，除了割自己中國人的肉吸自己中國人的血以外。如果我在紐約遇到了這樣愛撈錢，愛撈外國人的錢的中國人，我不但不會討厭他，我還會親愛他哩。鴉片吸得不足的水手們只知欺負自己中國人，猶太人在旁會心中暗笑。　　每每和這些外國商人們談話，談到一半便有點氣悶。我像那足上鎖着五尺鏈兒的獅子，第一步很舒服的跳去，猛地覺得後面還有鎖鏈；這個鎖鏈是我們中國的現實。我在批評着一切，我在理想着一切，我在描繪着我們理想中的年少中國的一切。然而我頓時發現了現實，我試試鏈兒，我足上有點痛。我怎樣能有一天很自由的敎訓這些不懂中國的人們，頓，而足上不致於還有覊絆呢？，猶太人説中國產的橘子有點苦，我却發狂的在剝着，吃着，我差不多忘記了那是别人應有的一份。那是我故鄕的出產我愛他是中國的，我也愛他是故鄕的。我覺得他的皮都很香，我討厭加里佛尼亞的橘，更討厭用刀來割吃的辦法；彷彿有點野蠻，把橘子的汁染在手上，那不是太原始的樣子嗎？猶太人也有稱贊中國的時候，我發現他的不誠懇。我不願意在目前受到别人對中國的稱贊。我心中暗想，在二十年後讓你們來妒忌。不要同情，不要贊誦。　　二十八個鐘頭的海程似乎很快。我抬頭看見了謝靈運詠歎過的孤㠗：再也没有什麽變化。風景，美極了，然而我希望牠多伸出幾條烟囱。我希望那帆船上勞苦的舟人，都化在新中國海軍的水手。他們依舊是勤勞，在中國有龐大海軍的日子，他們都是受世界尊敬的人。勤勞，中國的人民，保持着這一點，我們的前路没有走斷。輪船船主和我談話，他已經不是英國人了，他是百分之百的中國人！在海上二十多年了。招商局要造新船，也是他通知我的。當然我不是因這樣小事而樂觀，然而我覺得我愛聽更多像這樣的消息。　　窄狹的街道還是宋明時代的建設，洋車夫眞會敲竹槓。海關人員對中國人總要嚴厲些，盡責些。我没有因這些事而沮喪。一座牆（三）  Roberto　Bracco原著席滌塵譯　　「否則怎麽樣呢？」　　「什麽話都不要問我，但請可憐可憐我吧！　」　　「看樣子你要回到機上去了！」　　「不錯，我要回到機上去了。請恕我，請恕我吧！」　　「不要，不要，不要回到機上去！要如鬧聲再作，我要弄不完了。一點鐘之内，|和你」一樣，正和你一樣，··你肯解釋道理嗎？　　「請慈悲，請對我慈悲吧！」　　「你又爲什麽不對我慈悲呢？」　　「我是一個女子。」　　「我身體不好。」　　「可憐的人，可憐的人，要如你堅持，我答應|||不過請當着心，先生，請當着心，否　」則你要後悔的！」　　「後悔？」　　「不錯，後悔」　　「或許你得要馬上賣了所縫的東西去換藥嗎？」　　「不要問我！」　　「病的是老人家，還是小熟孩子？」　　「不要問我！」　　「是你的兒子，父親，還是母親？」　　「我求你，不要問我！」</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言女子職業的没落  心　　近年來婦女解放的唱聲已高呼了好久。要澈底的婦女解放，必須要女子能够經濟独立。女子經濟獨立，又必須以提倡女子職業爲前題。於是在男女平等，女子解放，呼聲之下，女子職業漸漸在社會上普及起來。女子們從家庭的束縛之下漸漸走向了職業界之中。打破了幾千年來「閨居」的觀念。　　女子職業的普及，本來是婦女解放運動中的好現象。可是都巿中的人民，具有很大的虚榮心。大都巿中的生活，又是没有止境的奢華。於是一般的女子，都不願從事於够刻苦自勵的工作而趨於斈樂的職業。至於所從事的職業是否有益於人羣，令譽的能否保守都置之不顧。祇要能够解决了眼前的奢侈生活，是惟一的需要目的。　　女子目前享樂性的職業，已在社會上充滿了。當舞女，是其中最盛行的一種。舞女的生活也可以説很裕如的。前一報載大滬跳舞塲和著名舞星姊妹三人的涉訟，稱自一月一日起至六月十五日止，五個月十五天共得舞資五千二百零六元五角，津貼洋九百五十三元二角，餐費一百六十五元，一共六千二百六十四元七角之多，平均每月的收入可得一千三百三十八元，一共六千二百六十的，次者在五角個月十五天中得舞資三千一百九十二元二角，津貼四百四十八元七角，餐費一百六十五元共三千八百零五元九角，平均每月可得六百九十二元，最小者得舞資三千五百八十八元一角。津貼五百二十三元二角，餐費一百六十五元，共得四千二百七十六元三角，平均每月可得洋八百六十八元，做一舞女每月可得千元左右的收入，眞是駭人聽聞，在現在的社會上，千元一月的職位是决計没有的，因此之故，舞女到了今日成爲女子職業界所最羨慕的事業。可謂無出其右的享樂職業了，也有女職員特地去充當舞女的，也有女學生没有了事業可做的時候跑到舞塲中去充當舞女的。　　除了享樂性的職業之外，實在也很少足够滿足現代女子環境職業界，充當一個女職員，幾十元一個月的薪水是很可觀的了，但是幾十元一個月的收入，常常不足使一個女子自己的用途，脂粉和衣服的消耗，那裏止幾十元一個月的限止，區區的薪給不足敷用的時候，經濟上仍舊不能够獨立，經濟上不能獨立，簡單的説一句，就是没有眞的澈底解放。仍舊是換湯不換藥的受着某一種的束縛。　　此外，社會上利用女子，以職業之名來作别種企圖的，也是女子職業前途的荆棘，巨大的公司裏面，好像是爲了適合潮流之所趨而雇用了許多女職員，幾個時代化的商家，以及其他的機關之中，都有女職員的存在，而這許多女職的事務非常清淡，甚之没有什麽重大的任務，但所得的薪金又必然比較任何職員（當然男職員）豐富，在這種情形之下就產生了一個名詞，稱爲「花瓶」的，加之於她們的向身上，實在這一種女子職業，除了爲裝飾品之外一無所用，社會上的女子職業界亦以這一種特殊的情形而佈滿了沉沉的暮氣，錄有女職員女秘書女書記之類，以面貌年齡爲標準，有能爲的反裏足不前了。　　女子解放之聲很高了，女子的經濟獨立亦很重要的必須解决了，但是女子的解放，又跟隨着女子職業的没落而破產！　　要防免女子職業的没落，應當連合起來，打破虚榮的心理，提倡節儉的生活，不作無謂的消耗，不去羨慕無恥的享樂性職業，剷除花瓶！禮尚往來  阿蘋　　語云：「禮尚往來。」　　但是爲仠麽要送禮？端午，中秋，婚喪喜慶，老太爺做八十冥慶，小孩子湯餅之宴，從年初一到大年夜，從生下地來到死去，想出了許許多多要送禮的名目，其實這都與人家什麽相干？而且「禮尚往來」，富貴人家忙着送禮，窮人被禮逼死。　　我最近因爲故居太小，想搬家，於是碰見了朋友都問我什麽時候搬，喬遷之喜，一定要擇個吉日，良辰的，但是我一有空閑，就偷偷地搬了，但是還有幾個朋友送了禮來的。　　去年生了個孩子，許多朋友又來慶賀我。其實這年頭皃多一張嘴是難過活一天，而且無辜的小生命要他到這世界上來吃基，是多末悲痛的事，有什麽値得慶賀呢！？　　許多人口頭宣傳，寫了文字，要廢除送禮，但「禮尚往來」像鐵鑄的一般，做人儘在這圈子裏打轉，據説是處世藝術之一，鳴咱！應付環境  覺夫　　敎國文的林先生，這學期來，其態度是改變的多了。在前年，他敎的國文倒也會選些沫若志摩的詩，魯迅作人的散文，··來做敎材；及至講授時，如果講關於新文學運動的事件，他也會很憤懣似的，對林琴南這流人的不識相挖苦幾句。但，今年來，情形就恰恰的二樣了；不但選文非從周秦兩漢諸家，則韓柳歐蘇各集，就稍涉及新文學的説話，也一概不談。　　林先生的態度，改變得這樣的急劇，當然使我們驚奇；並且，所敎的這些古東西，我們又委實覺生枯燥和難懂的很。所以，有一天當國文课下過後，我就邀集了幾位同學，一同到他的房間裏來，很懇切地對他要求：　　『先生，還是選些近代的東西來敎敎吧！完全讀那些古文，我們的確感不到興趣；並且又是很艱深的·』　　『是的，我曉得！不過，没有辦法！前學期畢業考試的情形，想你們是老早曉得的了，||我們學校二十多個人參加，十分之八九全是國文不及格。爲應付環境起見，你們感不到興趣，也得耐着心讀下去了！説時是很誠懇的，面上帶着很不自然的微笑。</p>

<p>當時聽完他這一段答話後，我們心裏雖仍大不以爲然；但，過後細心一想，覺得他的説話，倒也似是『句句金玉之言』。因爲『應付環境』，不是我們的林先生獨自創見的，社會上有眼光，有智慧者們的作事，大都如此。我們不是看見過當革命的空氣最高張時，連祭祠堂，拜土地也都掛起黨國旗，讀起遺囑來嗎？當救國的呼聲高唱入雲時，不是連跳舞，結婚，…也都打着救國的招牌來嗎？當科學發逹至頂端的今日，不是連符咒靈乩…之類，也都科學化了嗎？當新生活運動濔漫全國的現在，不是連迎神賽會，也都標着『新生活』的旗幟來嗎？『普羅』得勢時，不是普天之下盡皆『普羅』，『幽默』得勢時，不是普天之下又盡皆幽默嗎？…這些，都莫非是在應付環境而已。並且，一個人，如果死守個見，拼命專向一條路上走，結果只有『沒落』是他的分兒；如能看風轉舵，相機行事，過接連不斷多時，就能爬上人衆的頭頂了。這様，如非糊塗到底的傻漢，誰肯選定那苦而無補的路走呢？林先生，想來也的確是聰明透了的一個！　　『適乎環境者存，逆者亡。』（大意如此）這話是達爾文发那洋鬼子在『進化論』中説過的吧？不曉得聰明的我們中國人，早已懂得處依據着科學的大道理來處事了！　熱説  洋洋　　　今年天氣之奇熱，熱得可眞怕人，據天文臺報告：此尚爲近六十年來未有之現象。每日午刻，日影當中，由高下射，亢旱薰蒸，馬路上層之柏油，多被曬化，試問人類血骨之軀，又如何抵抗得住呢？無怪病疫蔓延，死亡相繼，社會狀態，頓見不寗，而且非但本埠上海一隅如此，大約各省各地，大率皆然。不圖人禍未已，天災繼來，吾民何辜，竟寄身於禍不單行之世，大有啼笑都難不可聊生之概。有人説：驕陽作惡，是殆存心替暴日張目，特來欺凌中國人。這是被炎威所逼者，無可洩怨，借題發揮，不過説而已。若果爲事實，太陽亦知對投井者下石，那也不像個太陽了。惟我偶然想起去年，總在冬末春初之際，忽然有位天文學家高唱其肯定之測騐，而謂去年無夏天。當時聽見的人，本多不敢據爲信史。等到入夏之後，依然大暖特暖，各地取高熱度，亦均在百度之上，事實旣如此證明，他的調言無稽，也就不攻自破，大家付之一笑。相傳這讕言之由來，實爲一無商業道德之商人策略，他本是一個經營「冰」生意的，很想藉此壟斷一切，而使其他售冰者,放棄貿易，好讓他專獨牟利。生意經雖然狠毒，其如老天不從其便。今年熱的度數，比較去年高得多，而且時期又較去年熱得早，一般人在此熱氣攻心萬分無奈之時，人人皆存有恨不無夏天之心，彷彿很希望再有位天文家出來説説『今年無夏天』才好。可知人類的心理，本來是矛盾的，僅僅乎體膚上受了些磨練，就這樣呌苦連天，然則那些頻年居處在熱帶的人類，又將如何？還有一般人的心理，以爲東亞的熱度，今年旣如此厲害，日本爲我國近隣，諒來他們國裏也未心風凉，若再按科學理論説，日本的火山，差不多全國中難隔一縣没有，萬一藉着熱力，陸續爆發起來，那麽天懲惡人，太陽苦薩没替他張目，却替我們報了仇。然而在我看來，天災流行，國家代有，救災卹隣，雖敵不論　方合乎大同人道。若是一味幸災樂禍，未免太没出息。果眞怕人欺侮侵凌，我們何不跳出去，一刀一槍，拼個你死我活，也才可以使旁人看看，知道中華民族，在世界上，尚有幾分樹立爭存之心，并非完全没藥救。至於想要靠着老天去殄滅兇人，顯示報應，那也和「去年無夏天」之説，同樣的無稽，同樣的可笑！大學應設跳舞科||一個建議友誼的故事  水冗　　永遠地記着亞里斯多德怎麽地讚美着偉大的友誼吧：「兩個肉體，一個靈」魂！」我對老金説。　　坐在我對面的，正在拔着坪子上的草兒的老金，停止了他的破壞的工作，點了點腦袋，儘嘻嘻地笑着。　　我們站起來了。夜是深了。無數的星兒，閃閃眨地着小眼睛，月亮寂寞地照着，天好像一張給糟蹋了的圖案。那女宿舍已經沉睡着了。不知從什麽地方透過來提琴的聲音，那麽抑掦地，憂鬰地奏着沙士比亞的「仲夏夜之夢」的曲子。風穿過樹葉子發出低低的嘆息。　　「啊，神秘的，魔術的夏夜啊！」老金喊了起來。　　手兒攙着手兒的　，我們跑到了海濱。老遠的燈塔的銀白色的光兒，照着海水鱗鱗地透着光芒。　海灘也很分明了。我們並着肩膀地坐在零亂的給水冲滑了的石頭中央，讓溫和的，放肆的晚風撫摸着我們的頭髮，聽着海的有規律的私語，一支孤獨的兩頭尖的小船兒吱呀　　　，吱呀的拍着漿兒，悄悄地溜過去了。　　我哼起一個有名的曲子來，老金嘘𠺕噓𠺕地吹起哨子合着我的哼聲，一道從空中注入秀美的海，溶化在那主裏面了。　　金拉着我説：「我們我們到那邊葡萄棚兒下面去吧！」　　我們跑到那兒，一陣兒濃郁的葡萄味迎着我們。他躺倒在草地上，半開着眼兒，靜靜地望着天，忽然，感傷地對我説：「將來我們畢業以後，不是就得燕子那麽的分離了嗎？　　「扔了你的感傷主義吧，」我回答。唔，讓我講一支故事你聽，它是很有名的。但我記不起它的作者了。那故事的内容是這麽的：從前有兩個很要好的朋友。一天，他們要分别了，就在一個小酒舖子裏分别。大家約定二十年以後的這天再在那兒相會。日子長着翅膀似的飛去了。往後期限到了！果然，他們兩個都没有失約。祇是一個做了警察，那個郤是那地方上定在懸賞　拿着的强盜！」　　他們不是銀水和火一樣的不能相容嗎」？老金截斷了我的話語，急促地問。　　「你猜，那結局是怎麽的？」　　他不想一想，便答應：「我以爲那警察一定把他的朋友放了！」他的。多偉大的友誼啊！」　　老金嘆息着。　　葡萄葉兒的影子，在我們的四周圍織成了美麗的模糊的花編模型，好像一張網兒蓋在我們的身子上，不過綱眼是不停地舞着。三少爺  雅非　　三少爺雖不是超人，但他却有平常人所没有的怪癖；他没有老婆，從前是有過的，後來因爲養不活她，所以她就背着三少爺而和觀音堂裏的敎書先生勾搭上了，隔了些時，三少爺雖然也有些風聞，然而躡於雌成，故終汪敢發作。可是她想偷偷摸摸，還不能暢所欲爲，最後，終於計議着跟那敎書先生私了。三少爺於計議着跟那敎書先生私奔了得安閒，因此並不去找尋，要是有人去問他，他也祇一笑置之。他現在惟一的伴侶是一隻花白貓，他愛花白貓比愛老婆還要關心。　　三少爺是一因敗落鄉紳的兒子，他老子在世的時候，確也曾顯赫過一時的，所以，現在人家還不呌他名字而總喊他一聲三少爺的。要是在莘村灣一帶地方，只要一提到「三少爺」這三個字，谁都會毫不遲疑回答出他的居處：他的大名，眞是誰個不知，那個不曉！　　他所棲身的地方，就是他老祖宗的墳莊屋，可也是坍了的，祇剩了二架椽子的破瓦。這裏剛好給他一個舖位，所謂舖者，就是一個稻草堆而已！　　他没想到前程，也不追溯過去，更不去憧憬未來：他祇曉得過一天算一天。他惟一的吃飯本領，只有一只伶俐的嘴巴，和一雙手，兩條腿。他歡喜講故事，在國志演義，水滸傳，精忠傳等，没有一樣不熟悉的，講起孔明的神計妙算，岳飛的盡忠保國，眞是有聲有色啦！要是給他抽飽了大烟的時候，講起來那更有力了。兩條腿奔起路來，也很來得的，三四十里路正不擱在他心上。所以無論村子裏隨便那一家有了婚喪喜事，他便得挨一份差使：便是人家，也很願意用他的。因爲他一天的代價，但須二百個頭大烟一筒，和三餐黃糙米飯，菜餚好壞是不計較的。到了晚上，賞他二兩白干喝喝，那更起勁了。不過有一樣；有人家要請敎他，照例在額外要給他半碗飯，和一撮热骨頭的，這是他要去帶給那惟一的伴侶花白貓吃的，　　遇到臨時雇主吩咐他去做隨便什麽事情，他總是「噢！噢！噢？」的答應的　　還有一層，一使人家討厭而看得起他的，便是他的手脚規矩，生性忠厚尤直；因此隨便在那一家屋裏穿房入户，人家都很人任他的。他的「人緣」也怪好；村子裏的小孩子，都喜歡和他住在一起玩耍的。就是人家，也憐憫他而時常將一些殘羹冷飯去送給他吃：　　「喏！這裏還有二碗飯，和一筷子」菜：三少爺！你拿去吃了吧！」　　他接過飯，對他們望了一眼，便也笑嘻嘻的，老實不客氣的，坐在階沿上去吃了。　　前天，五叔到吾這裏來，吾向他打聽鄕下的情形；同時想起了一年不見的三少爺，便紀念似的問起了現在怎樣？五叔掏了搖頭説：　　「他嗎？他已經在前幾天挺熱的時候，發痧發死了！他發痧的時候，又没有人照顧，又没有人去替他喊挑痧的，實在是活活的發死的。」他説着似乎十分可憐三少爺的死！　　最後，吾又向他追詢，三少爺惟一的伴侶|花白貓|呢？據他説：在三少爺入殮的那天，那只花白貓遠跑來跑去的呌着，後來不知到那裏去了，這幾天連踪踪也没有。</p>

<p>三談托兒所與公育  師石　　關於托兒所與公育問題，筆者曾二次爲文商榷；本報婦女園地茲九君，亦經兩度駁論，惟筆者對問題中心，係著眼於現代社會應否實施公育一點；對於托兒所本身，則在假定其創設主旨爲實施公育之第一步驟的前提下，始有討論餘地，故筆者疊經明示「如其辦舉動機不過爲某一般人之便利，自無需非議」；辭意極顯，毌待詮釋，可是茲九君未能認請題旨，遽發爲比附傅會之譚；一方復撫拾文詞句，斷章求兹；這未免有乖筆者期望之初衷了，茲爲貫徹立論本旨，擬對家庭，婦女，及兒童三方面，分别加以研討，俾得認定兒童公育在理論上與實際上得失。　　（一）公育與家庭　家庭生活是人類文明進化的表率；有許多下等動物，因爲没有家庭組織，便會經天演淘汰，絶滅其種；古代的初民與未開化的人類，也因家庭的不穏固，使其生活不能安定，可見人類文化日進，家庭生活亦隨之而臻於健全美滿；這是自然的下例，家庭對於人類行爲與社會秩序，復有着相互消長的關繫；我們從中外各種社會調查與統計中，常可窺見人類的死亡比率，和犯罪分析，以及游民的數量等等，總是那些没有家庭没有妻兒的單身漢佔着絶對的多數；這更可證明健全的社會，必由健全的家庭所組成的；我國古訓，以修身齊有家爲人生事業之起點；歐美各國亦頌贊美滿家庭，爲人生幸福眞諦，Home　Sweet　Aome這闋千古朽的名歌，亦卽萬世不渝之眞理，固然，在過去封建社會與宗法制度下那種男性中心父權獨裁的家庭，是畸形的，是病態的；但到了文明進化的社會，在「兩性均等」與「兒童本位」的家庭組織下，我們豈還能心懷疑家庭的本　？現在主張公育的人，往往把我國家庭的腐敗引爲持論之要旨；但他們不民從根本上去改革家庭的制度，却因噎廢食地遽使無辜孩提摒逐於父怙母恃之外，這不僅破懷家庭幸福，蔑視人生意義，抑且妨害社會秩序，而違迕自然的衍化了。　　（二）公育與婦女　公育足以擺脱職業婦女養育兒女的覇絆，這是贊同者的最大理由：可是按諸實際，徒爲一種高調，我國文化水準極度低落，婦女文盲數量尤高於男性。能受相當敎育的，祇是不能列入統計的極少數；而在「學費一元」的現代敎育制度下，這極少數的智識份子，也卽是有產階級的婦女；她們願意從事職業服務社會的，更是少數中之最少數，而她們的職業觀念，多不以生活爲前提；卽有兒女，儘有餘裕自雇乳媽保姆，實無需乎公育，至於一部份蝟集於都巿的勞働婦女們，如在商塲中當夥員廠家中當工友的婦女：我們從她們菲薄的收入上，可以肯定她們决無資力爲兒女按月繳納育費的，而在這畸形的社會上，一般雇用主們對於婦女職工的選擇和任用，往往以妙齡未嫁的少女爲標準，例如滬上的絲紗廠家，都有排斥年老色衰的婦人的趨勢；而各大著名百貨公司和大商塲中，更顯然以女子出嫁構成解職的條件；（一個男子的結婚有時可爲加薪的理由）這種鐵一般的事實，足證現社會絶不能爲一個母親保留着相當的職位，那末實施公育，不是失去了他的根本依據了吧？我人又記得西諺有一女性本弱爲母則强」的名言，而愛倫凱的「母性」説，更是顚撲不破的至理，並且我人審察人類間「倫理」的史之演遞，深知女性能在家庭間取得優越的地位，完全因爲她擁有她自己的兒女之故；一旦推行公育，把兒女從她們懐中奪去，她們的地位恐怕立時會發生動搖吧？（未完）廢話連篇  文丐　　　「一爲文人便無足觀，」説這句話的，一定是文人舞疑。因爲御用文人的不願意説出這句話，希望做文人的更不願意説出這句話。　　駡人家陞官發財爲大逆不道的人，駡得最兇的一定是這兩種人：没有官做没有財發的窮人，和己經做了官發了財而下野的知名之士。一旦這兩種人陞了官發了財，他不會駡人家了，他更没想到以前曾經駡過人家的話了。　　要求言論自由的人，一旦政權在手，他己經忘記别人的言論自由了。　　反對殺人的人，一旦政權在手，他殺人最兇。　　　　做媳婦的怨恨婆婆的壓迫，到了她做了婆婆的時候，她也壓迫她的媳婦。　　人類就是利己的動物。　　利己主義好像洪水般泛濫於現社會間，同情這美德變成了反動的名詞。因此由同情心發的人道主義也變成了大逆不道。　　　博愛主義更變成了「爲敵人張目」的罪狀。　　醫生本來是大公無私的事業，因此在甲方看來是他不該救治窮人，在乙方看來是他救治了富人卽是通敵。　　昨刋陶哥，作者係若望君，誤排若金，特此更正。小説藍嘉寳的心境（六）  希雋　　因爲藍嘉寳有兩支星子似的眼珠，平靜地射出明麗的光澤。透過淡淡的笑裏邊的一段柔情，會使靈魂醞釀着春的戀的季候夢啦。那不嗜好説話的沉默的表情，看着是多够味兒。實在没一個地方呌人生厭。瞧着她平地被人家陵鑠着。哭了出來。眞有些冒火。　　|這種人未免太無聊，就在女人頭上佔了風，也不見得光榮吧！　　|他們可正認爲最排塲的。　　|低能的行爲。　　|低能角色的英雄呵！　　起勁地替她不服氣，而藍嘉寳還是綿綿地啜咽着，她摸出一塊小小的紅手絹，抹着鼻涎子，嘴裏在呢呢的哼唧着。咱們的話她是聽到了的，幾次扒着珠子向後轉，撅着一張要説什麽話似的嘴巴，但給卡爾一瞅住，又條的飛了過去。　　|别傷心吧，大個子哭着不成樣兒，你是有道理的，有什麽事咱替你頂。和蠻起的大喇叭一同移動了身子，卡爾輕輕拍着藍嘉寳的背膊，一支手臂黑蛇似的纏過她的腰圍，舞起一雙不急不緣的Tangoo　　透過涙顆子的後邊掛一個淡漠的明麗的笑渦兒，藍嘉寳像找到了親暱的知心者似的，收子涙水，把一肚皮的怨憤麗麗拉拉地説了出來：　　|你瞧這事誰横蠻不論理？　　｜自然你有理，八王龜子才這末混帳。　　　|這種人開口滿嘴粗，流氓亦没這麽下種。　　|是的，别怕，碰着頂到底，自有人帮你出頭。　　|唉！咱們一夥人一輩子總是吃　，處處受人家合夥的欺侮，糟蹋。那里敢跟誰抬樠，當心吃耳括子呵！這種活受罪的生涯，除了背地裏和涙呑飲之外，向誰哭訴呢。　　|是的，不過生活所給與的痛楚誰都不能逃免的，但不必這專感傷呵！　　|謝謝你的美意。　　　藍嘉寳感動的説着。臉上開出一串笑的花蕊，貼着的肢體越擁緊，像連成一塊似的。擱在肩膊上邉的腦袋索性全埋入卡爾的胸口，忘了跟音符踏拍子，忘了心中所有的頪惱，哇麗哇啦地説個不休。説着説着，跳着跳着，卡爾摸知了對方的性兒，用着一張伶俐的嘴説了一長串呌藍嘉寳一聽快意的話，藍嘉寳也會因此滿足啦！半道兒紫色的燈光減了，就在昏閽閽的夢似的情景裏邊，準着正伸上出的嫩腮兒，卡爾熱烈的印了幾吻，藍嘉寳瞟了他一下，媚媚地笑着，又躱落到胸口去，嘻嘻地，卡爾陶醉地半閉了珠子，出神地聆着胸口一串在繼續搖響着的笑的銀鈴，嘻嘻地。</p>

<p>電影專刊　　中華民國貳拾叁年柒月拾叁日　星期五The　Shun　Pao　Screen　Bectfon	　　一個臨時演員口中的好萊塢電影明星的特性（上）  馥　　臨時演員差不多是攝影塲上最不幸的，最受人輕視的工作者了。他們雖然比較站在攝影塲門外，不得其門而入的人好些，但是他們辛勤工作了，除了領受些微的酬金僅足供一日飽餐之外，他們又有什麽好處呢？但他們在工作的時候，是與一般明星們很接近的，或者比一般要求見他們的，新聞記者還要接近些，因之他們對於一般明星們的言動脾氣，或者了解得更深切些。並且明星們怎樣對待他們的，他們更有親切的感覺。以下的是一位臨時演員的談話，讀之可知明星們在他們的眼光中，倒底是怎樣的人物也：我們先説葛雷泰嘉寳吧。她對於我們臨時演員，有一個與衆不同的態度。許多明星是極仁愛的…仁愛得顯然他們是降尊紓貴,免强萬分。還有許多是簡捷眼高過頂，目空一切。惟有嘉寳，她是近情近时的體貼！我曾聽見她和朋友們説過：「一個臨時演員，並不是一個奴僕，一個農夫，或是一個苦役。他是一個藝術家，要是他是一個好的臨時演員的話，所以他就應當受到一個藝術家應受的待遇。」還有一個人告訴嘉寳説，　有一家影片公司，在公告牌上是稱呼那些Extras（額外演員卽臨時演員）爲Stemporary　Actors（卽暫時演員之意。嘉寳聽了，大笑了一陣。等到她笑完了説道：「嘿，這倒是好的。太暫時了，可憐的東西。但是那個稱呼確比單單一個字的Extra好得多。在好萊塢，這個Extra的名詞，已經被一般人輕視了。嘉寳是常常疲乏的，因爲，恐怕知道的人很多了，她是患着一種貧血症的。那個病並不危險，但却很傷精神。她常常要收歛貯蓄，她的精神，等到表演的時候，就完全傾注了出來。因此，她在休息時間，是顯得十分疲倦的。因爲她自己感覺到疲倦的痛苦，所以她對她四週的人，更容易知道他們的疲倦，並且對於他們的疲倦，感覺到十二分的同情。有一天我正站着休息，嘉寳突然從黑暗的角落裏喊我道：「你倦了吧，我的親愛的。坐下休息休息吧。」我告訴他我累得太厲害了，但是我不敢坐下，恐怕衣服弄縐了。嘉寳笑着啐了一口道：「什麽好衣服！坐下好了！這裏有椅子。一個人不要累過頭了。那是於體康有關係的。往往因爲和一般明星們，同在一地工作、所以常常聽　　我們做臨時演員的，往往因爲和一般明星們，同在一地工作，所以常常聽得見他們的談話，而是外人所不知道的。你們知道喬治賴甫德的熱心求監獄改良的工作嗎？恐怕你們知道的很少吧！原來喬治賴甫德是生長於紐約的下等社會中的。他糼時的一般小朋友，因爲不受良好的敎育，所以都是在法律的錯誤邊長大的。其中許多因爲觸了法綱而被關進監牢裏去了。喬治因爲那一般朋友着實可憐，就立志設法促成監獄的改良。他並且曾經帮助幾個出獄之人，改邪歸正，這是一件外間所不知的事吧！（未完）影片談評評「誰是君子」  凌鶴　　Jimmy　the　Gent|大光明　　假使説我們承認劇作者是企圖在這一影片中譏諷或暴露美國現行法律的虚僞而不合理的話，那末，這一點顯然是寫得非常不够的，雖然説這種影片的製作，還祇有華納兄弟公司在美國電影中比較進步的地方。　　本來喜劇的創作，每每是十分誇張的，但是它仍然得百分之百的表現眞實。正確的説，它應當是以誇大的方法使社會的客觀存在，比眞實更眞實的表現出來。而這一點也就成爲我們批評的主要要求。　　不錯，我們承認，「誰是君子」的劇作者是針對着美國的現行法律的虚僞，而以喜劇的形式暴露，我們看到富人的遺產，在法律的明文之下，多少聰明的訟棍可以用其詭辯的方法，或者是假造證據，藉以從中漁利。因此法律這東西，乃成爲變象的兒戲。這一點，乃是非常眞實的表現。但是劇作者却爲了迷惑於喜劇的形式，而在許多地方徒作不盡情理的誇張，不能維持其暴露的嚴正的態度，因此像高律其人者，便客觀的成爲非現實的人物了。好的喜劇是寓莊嚴於嬉笑怒駡之中，反之，一味的趨迎於庸俗的笑料，將必然的流爲輕薄的作品。　　更明顯的是劇作者非常俗氣的，將兩個不必結合的男女硬生生的結合起來，因此，不惜多做一些無謂的戲，這使他充分的流露出卑俗的巿儈氣味。何况美國觀衆都要求生硬的Happy　Ending，還是一個極大的疑問。至少，進步的觀衆是不會要求那千篇一律的無謂的大團圓。　　此外，我們要説到的是導演者按照劇本表現了不少極生硬的笑料，有許多是誇張到令人討厭的地步。其中比較的有成績的，乃是對話的生動，以及高律到華廉的公事房中，一杯又一杯的吃咖啡，倒是很可取的。　　同時没能好的導演，也不會有好的演技可看的。也許詹姆士賈克奈頗有一點待殊作風，但在這裏却總覺得生硬。珀蝶黛維斯也只是多炫耀幾襲新裝而已，而哭笑不分的面部表情，恐怕任何人也不歡喜吧？　　總之，這一影片，除了對話可笑或塲面熱鬧之外，是没有什麽可取的。在華納的出品中，在電影藝術上説，這是一部水平綫下的作品。評「十三集關東大俠」|光華  亞夫　　看了這一影片之後，使我們首先表示驚異的，便是武俠片居然會在這年頭復活起來。大概誰也得承認的，武俠片無論如何是落後時代的吧。當中國電影在廣大的觀衆擁護之下，獲得了優良的進步之現在，而完全虚構的胡鬧的武俠片會趁時出現，其社會的根據，和目前的提倡宗敎迷信救國，乃是完全一致的。不過我們也曾經聽到説過，中國也有人在努力提倡敎育電影，然而這「關東大俠」之類的武俠片，便是敎育電影的實踐嗎？當我在光華聽着不少小朋友們在拍手喝采，對於那種生硬的噱頭和「打出手」不示熱忱歡迎的時候，我們覺得極大的憂鬰。然而這一影片是正式通過了的，而且聽説「火燒紅蓮寺」之類的影片，也在爭着印新拷貝，熱心電影文化的諸公，未知作何感想？　　説到這一影片的本身，無論在那一方面説，幾乎都是没有批判之價値的。故事的不通，固不必説，而生硬得令人難耐的噱頭，或無理取鬧的打武，簡直使人搖頭而已。　　説得遠一點，武俠片的影式，未嘗不可以滲入若干有利於社會民族的東西，當然我們並不要求所謂新的武俠片之抬頭，不過是説比較進步一點的劇作家，卽在武俠片中决剑會喪心病狂的完全有意的危害觀衆之思想。但是在這裏却十足的封建説敎：主婦的託孤，義僕的救主，淸这的廉明，義士的俠氣，再加上「鼎懷仁」之謂頂壞人之流，於是英雄美人，大打一塲，最後是服法了結。如此不通的陳腐故事，我們還用得解説嗎？？　　好了罷，我們最後希望月明公司爲社會着想一下！重拍有聲「空谷蘭」　　「空谷蘭」一片，曾經號召過廣大的電影觀衆，因爲它情節哀艷曲折，最近重映，還受着觀衆盛大的歡迎，所以明星公司决定將該片重攝，將無聲改爲有聲，主角人選，已决定胡蝶高占非嚴月閒，較之舊時演員，（默片中主角是張織雲楊耐梅朱飛一）尤爲出色，將來的轟動，大概量一定的。一舉兩得　看「漁光曲」兼避暑  障　　今年的天氣是熱到極點了。避暑的地方雖然很多，但是在經濟和時間上，每每發生問題。因此滬上裝有冷氣的影戲院，入夏以來，營業都很不錯，而尤以北京路的金城大戲院爲最。據説已經開映一月的「漁光曲」，近來不但賣座没有减色，並且一天比一天好，該院對於下次開映片子，雖然早就排定，但因「漁光曲」不能拿去的關係，只好將它擱起。我們試一推測其原由，一則因爲「漁光曲」這個片子，確有欣賞的價値，再則因爲上海專映國產片的戲院，現在還祇金城一家。看國產佳片兼可避暑，大家何樂而不爲呢。「國際間諜」之一斑　　守如處女，狡如脱兎，也不足形容此輩臨難應變的戰士們於萬一！不信一觀「歐戰的秘密」的演出就可以覺得「行之維艱」了。　　她們或他們，必須具有好幾種很難得的主要條件，否則必敗無疑。例如豐富的科學智識，冷靜的頭腦，勇敢而沉着的態度，敏捷的動作，深刻的觀察等等。女性們更須有動人的資質，勾引的魔力。然而女間諜的訓練，較之男性爲難。倘能成就，那效用之安，就非男子所得望其項背了。　　南京明天起映的戰事巨片，Madame　Spy「歐戰的秘密」，是黃蕾女士主演的。全劇之生動，緊張，活潑，足以説明歐戰之激烈。的確，是本年度一部不可多得之戰事名片。　　尤其在此太平洋上戰雲瀰漫時候，吾人不可不明白了解，這種特殊戰士們的特殊任務，是怎樣進行的。何况，在危象四伏的吾國，更須要澈底觀察着她們或他們之行動。　　▲更正　本刋十一日片評「嬌姿誤儂」，脱漏「儂」字，又文中Jennie　Frisco係MidnjghtMary之誤，特此更正。電影小說公主三十日（Thirty　Princess）（一）  金鵲美國派拉蒙公司出品　雪爾維亞薛妮主演　　鵲耐寻姓蘭因，她在一年之前，棄家出走，想自己去尋求些運氣。她那時很自信，以爲一定可以在舞台上一鳴驚人的。她對於其他一切的事情，亦都很有把握。她想一個人出門在外，隨時可以碰到奇遇，今天不知道明天的事，這一點鐘不知道下一點鐘的事，隨時隨地都可以得到驚人的幸運。但是她到了現在，那裏自信之心，漸漸有些動搖了。她恐怕隨時隨地都可以遇到失意的事情，而明天所能臨到她頭止的，恐怕不是什麽幸運而係房東太太的恐嚇了，因爲她現在一身所有，僅僅一角七分錢，房錢已經欠了好幾個星期了。近來她連飯都要少吃，不久就要斷糧了。她每天的遇到的，有戲院經理不關痛癢的聳聳肩膀。這時耐雪在馬路上走着，遇見了一位熟悉的演員。她喊住了他道。「哈囉，唐納。」唐納，史博資伍德被她一喊，楞住了。她神氣十足的對着耐雪，恐怕她觸着他似的。耐雪道：「你還没有給我找到事　　情嗎？我自從上次登臺之後，尸經引起了許多人的注意了。」她翻着一本記事簿，那是她隨身帶的，預備隨時去見戲院經理的。史博資伍德説道：（你上次登台，我亦看見的。」他説了冷冷地走開了。　　耐雪跑進食品店，化了五分錢買了一碗黑豆湯啜着。她生平痛恨豆湯，但是那個東西，是滋養料很豐富的。她看見另外一個窗子裏，擺着一大盆的火雞，還有燻得黑黃的肉，還有白薯漿和紅蘿葡，一個小銀杯裏盛着菓子醬。耐雪不覺抓緊了拳頭，無緣無故的捶着那玻璃窗。可是那扇玻璃窗，亦莫名其妙的被她輕輕一捶就捶開了。耐雪伸手就去抓那個盆子。正在這個當兒，有兩個偉男子，他們已經監視了她許久了，很迅速地走了過來。耐雪心裏明白，偵探來了。但是她很感激的是，那兩位偵探並没有吵閙起來，不過一邊一個，執住了她發抖的手，將她一架，架到一輛汽車裏去了。在汽車裏，耐雪還苦苦哀求着那兩位偵探，説她並没有偷那個火雞，但是他們好像一些没有聽見似的。她漸漸害怕起來了，怎麽這兩個偵探，多半是發神經病吧？好像其中的一個，竟稱呼她公主起來了。她更害怕了，他們坐的汽車走到一所宮殿式的大厦面前停下了。她陪着那兩位偵探，一步一步地走上了曲折的石階，到了那所大厦的門口。一個司開人來開着門。他們走過許多陳設富麗，地下舖滿厚地氈的屋子，走進了一間碩大無明的書房。那裏有一個有威嚴的大胖子迎接着他們。他欣然地喊着：「公主」。這是她聽得淸淸楚楚的，並没有聽錯呀！怎麽他們竟呌她是公主呢？正在這個時候，那個大胖子又對着那兩位偵探説道：「好。你們辦事很能幹。明天你們來領賞。我代表泰龍尼亞王國，先向你們道謝。」這樣，他將兩個偵探打發走了。（未完）</p>

<p>(Xi'an) Finance Minister Kong gave the following statement to a Central News Agency reporter: "My impressions of this inspection of North China are very good. Although the provinces of North China have not yet recovered from the war, or because of years of disasters and the bankruptcy of the rural economy, the provincial governments have been able to follow the central government's administrative plans, taking into account the special circumstances of the localities. On the one hand, they are engaged in political improvement, and on the other hand, they are engaged in local relief. The progress is rapid and no effort is spared, which is a very good phenomenon during the national crisis. In order to reduce the burden on local areas and promote industrial development, the Ministry of Finance has resolved at the National Finance Conference to abolish exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, and has already ordered the provinces to strictly implement this. The so-called exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies refer to illegal local apportionments and various surtaxes, which have a direct and significant impact on people's livelihood. The implementation situation in the provinces has been published in national newspapers, so I will not repeat it here. From what I have seen on the ground, Shanxi Province can reduce the local burden by more than 6 million yuan per year after implementing this policy. The Northwest Provinces have been suffering from severe drought for years, and the disasters are extremely serious. In addition, traffic is blocked, resulting in poverty for the people, which is a natural result. However, exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies are also a factor, so the implementation of abolishing exorbitant taxes is particularly urgent. As for the follow-up measures, I will seek remedies in the future based on what I have learned from the inspection. Regarding the request from the Shaanxi Province Relief Association to the central government for relief funds, totaling 400,000 yuan, the Ministry of Finance has already allocated 300,000 yuan. The remaining 100,000 yuan will be allocated at a later date because the economic situation in Shaanxi is gradually improving. If the disaster area still needs relief, not only will the approved funds be allocated without any problem, but if necessary, we will do our best to continue to find ways. As for my opinions on Northwest finances, I have always advocated taking from the people and using it for the people. If the people's difficulties are slightly alleviated and the government's financial resources gradually become abundant, all construction undertakings can be gradually implemented. Director Yan Xishan of the Jin-Sui Pacification Headquarters also feels that reducing the local burden is an urgent task. In the past month, Sui Province has completed the reduction of its army, cutting a total of more than 20,000 officers and soldiers, which can reduce expenses by 200,000 yuan per month. Our country is suffering from foreign aggression and internal troubles, and industries are not flourishing. The banking industry is suffering from a lack of investment opportunities, so buying government bonds is a last resort. The government has been working hard to maintain credit over the years, repaying bonds on schedule, with increasing value and decreasing interest. This business is already unprofitable and has no harm to the national economy and people's livelihood." (11th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>Gu Weijun Visits Wang Jingwei Yesterday and Will Go to Jiangxi to Visit Chiang Kai-shek</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Gu Weijun met with Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Tang Youren and Chief Secretary Li Shengwu at the Yangtze River Hotel at 10 a.m. on the 12th, talking for about an hour. At 11 a.m., he met with the press, talking about the international situation and his feelings after returning to the country. At 12 p.m., he and Shi Zhaoji visited old friends by car. At 4 p.m., he visited Wang Jingwei, who comforted him greatly. Gu is scheduled to go to Jiangxi on the 14th to visit Chiang Kai-shek to report on the international and diplomatic situation, and then go to Shanghai before returning to his ancestral home in Jiading. (12th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Gu Weijun arrived in Nanjing on the night of the 11th and stayed at the Yangtze Hotel. Tang Youren visited him at 10 a.m. on the 12th. At 11 a.m., he met with reporters, and then went out to visit friends. At 4 p.m., he visited President Wang to report. At 7 p.m., he attended the State Council's banquet for the Panchen Lama. He will stay for a few days before going to Gulangyu to visit Chairman Chiang. According to Gu's talk to reporters, his return to the country this time is to take care of personal matters and observe the domestic situation and the situation in the Far East. At the same time, he will also report on the European situation for the government's reference. In the past two years, the world situation has changed, and our country's situation is becoming more and more dangerous. Not only is this something that our country has never experienced in the past three hundred years, but no country in the world has had such an unfavorable encounter. Those who sympathize with our country all hope that we will rise up and save ourselves. Our country's financial and material resources are far inferior to others, but if we are sincerely united, concentrate our strength, and jointly shoulder the responsibility of saving the country, we can take advantage of the favorable timing and geographical location. If we have the support of the people, then there is still hope for the future. As for the international situation, all countries feel economic panic. Last year's World Economic Conference ended without result after more than a month of discussions because no country was willing to give up its own interests. Now they are all trying to consolidate themselves and implement strict import restriction policies. The disarmament conference also has no results. All countries are currently expanding their military strength as much as possible, and the international crisis is on the verge of breaking out. I will report all my observations to the government.

<h3>The Significance of Anglo-French Cooperation</h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>According to recent European dispatches, the scope of the recent Franco-British talks was extensive. However, the main issues were no more than three: (1) the establishment of an Eastern European mutual security pact; (2) the issue of disarmament; and (3) the naval conference for the coming year. It is reported that as a result of the talks, Britain has decided to maintain a benevolent neutrality towards the Franco-Russian mutual security plan. If Germany can sign such a security pact, France is prepared to make concessions on armaments to Germany. If this news is accurate, then France will be able to control Germany at will in the future, and there will be no need for multiple considerations.</p>
<p>We should still remember the fierce conflict between Britain and France at the plenary session of the Disarmament Conference last month. How long has it been, and the harmony between the two countries has reached this point. Examining the reasons, we know that the change in the British government's attitude is by no means accidental. The most obvious examples are the meeting between the two heroes, Venice, Germany and Italy, Italy's determination to build warships, and Japan's claim for naval equality, all of which are key factors. Although the outcome of the meeting between the two heroes, Germany and Italy, is unknown, there is no doubt that the path to cooperation has been opened. If Germany and Austria can abandon their new grievances and restore their old friendship, forming a union of Italy, Germany, Austria, and Hungary, then restoring the old pattern of the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria, and Italy is not difficult. History records that the alliance between Britain and France in 1904 and the rapprochement between Britain and Russia in 1907 were both aimed at the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria, and Italy. If the old dreams of Germany and Italy are revived and the old path of the pre-war era is returned to, then the situation of alliances and counter-alliances in the past will not be difficult to see again today. It is also not impossible for us to say that the close friendship between Britain and France is to prevent the revival of the German-Italian alliance.</p>
<p>Today, Germany's strength is not sufficient, and the British are less suspicious of it. However, this is not the case with Italy. The British territories are all over the world, and the Mediterranean is the thoroughfare for its east-west communication. If there is a strong naval power blocking this, and this country has Germany, Austria, and Hungary as its backing, then the threat it poses to the British Empire will be no less than that of the German Empire before the war. Therefore, for the sake of self-defense, Britain really needs to cooperate with France.</p>
<p>The Five-Power Naval Conference was originally scheduled to open next year. It would have been fine to postpone it temporarily in this eventful autumn in Europe. However, Britain first requested to hold preliminary talks, and then stopped without any results. It is very obvious that it intends to explore Japan's intentions in order to determine its own policies. If the naval claims of Britain and Japan can be coordinated, the British will not need to ally with France so urgently. Unfortunately, Japan is determined to dominate the Pacific and does not allow other countries to intervene. The British are really forced into this situation and cannot but tend towards France. Only in this way can they use France's assistance to deal with the European situation. If a change occurs one day, they can free up their naval main force to deal with Japan.</p>
<p>Therefore, the scope of this Anglo-French cooperation is not limited to a corner of Europe, but also extends to the Far East. Speaking of its overall impact: First, if the Eastern European mutual obstruction pact is established, the momentum of Germany and Japan jointly attacking Soviet Russia will be broken, and the war can be delayed. Second, Italy and Germany are surrounded by Britain, France, and their allies, and even if they want to unite, it will be difficult to implement. Third, Italy's fleet is already constrained by the French navy, and Britain has the possibility of transferring its main fleet in the Atlantic and Mediterranean to the Far East at any time. If Britain and the United States cooperate without any twists and turns, then Japan can be pressured at next year's naval conference. Even the new situation in the Far East after the conclusion of the Washington and London Naval Treaties (such as the puppet state issue) may even be brought up for discussion. This is something that our countrymen should also pay close attention to.</p>
<h3>Japan Instructs Puppet Regime to Raise Funds: 9 Million Yuan Annually</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the concrete measures for the disposal of the 9 million yuan shared by "Manchukuo," the Ministry of Finance convened a meeting of the ministry on the afternoon of the 11th, and the situation is described as follows: (1) How to determine the period and procedures for "Manchukuo" to pay the shared amount to the Japanese government; In Japan, it will be included in the settlement for the 9th year of Showa or the budget for the 10th year. However, due to errors in the procedures, this point must be thoroughly discussed. Regarding the payment method, whether it is paid in one lump sum or in installments, this technology will also need to be discussed in detail with the "Manchukuo" government in the future. If the shared amount is immediately remitted to Japan, it will have an abnormal impact on the exchange. Therefore, it is planned to use this type of amount as the Japanese government's foreign currency and deposit it in the Central Bank of Manchuria. This is roughly decided. As for the specific methods, detailed consultations will be held with all relevant parties for handling. (12th, Japan Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>Issue of Treaty Violation: Statement by Japanese Foreign Ministry</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The issue of the closure of the opening and closing devices of the Yalu River Railway Bridge became an issue in the British House of Commons on the 11th. Foreign Minister Simon replied that he had telegraphed Clive, the British ambassador to Japan, to protest to the Japanese government. Therefore, the Japanese Foreign Ministry issued the following informal statement: Although the Sino-British treaty guarantees the freedom of trade for foreigners in Andong, it cannot restrict Japan, a third party, and there is no obligation to change the Yalu River Railway Bridge to an opening and closing type. Only in fact, consideration should be given, but the British request cannot be granted. (12th, Electric Communications dispatch)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Assembly Emphasizes Cultural Work, Seeks to Instill Anti-War Ideals Through Education, Actual Disarmament Fails, Promotes Spiritual Disarmament</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Assembly has organized an advisory committee to study methods of spreading knowledge about the League of Nations through education. This advisory committee held its first meeting today. Its mission consists of three types: (1) to formulate a plan of action so that future generations can know the purpose and activities of the League of Nations; (2) to discuss spiritual disarmament; (3) to discuss international relations issues. The above three items should be reported to the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation. In addition, the association must also study methods of spreading knowledge of the League of Nations through film and radio. This kind of effort is often carried out separately in various countries. An example can be given of its educational methods: Armistice Day on November 11th every year is commemorated as a victory day in some countries. This is enough to cultivate a war mentality. In the future, it should be changed to "War Cessation Commemoration" instead of "Victory Commemoration." In this way, the war-loving psychology of the people can be gradually eliminated and their new ideas of international cooperation can be cultivated. (11th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>United States Repeatedly States Maintaining Current Naval Ratio, Shipbuilding Program Proceeds Quickly, to Reach Treaty Limits, Airship Policy Under Study, "Los Angeles" No. 1 Retired Due to Age</h3>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. Navy Secretary will immediately build warships worth 90 million U.S. dollars. This plan has been approved by Congress. Navy Secretary Swanson said that it will be carried out quickly in order to complete 102 warships as soon as possible, so that the U.S. Navy meets the limits of the London Treaty. The Geneva Disarmament Conference has collapsed, so the 5:5:3 naval ratio of Britain, the United States, and Japan must be maintained. Any change is opposed by the United States. The current 90 million dollars allocated can build one heavy cruiser, two 10,000-ton cruisers, twelve destroyers, two leader destroyers, and six submarines. Mr. Smith said that the backbone of the navy is the battleship, so the United States opposes the British proposal to reduce the number and tonnage of battleships. As for the U.S. Navy personnel, only 85 percent of the quota is reached. Therefore, at the last inspection in New York Bay, there were 60 destroyers that did not participate due to insufficient manpower. (11th, National News dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) U.S. Navy Secretary Swanson stated today that the U.S. Navy airship Los Angeles will no longer fly in the future due to its old age and reduced performance, and will only be used for training at the Lakehurst Naval Air Station. Mr. Smith also said that the U.S. Navy's airship policy has not yet been decided. It is currently studying whether this type of airship is beneficial to the fleet and worth the cost. We do not want to waste money, but we want to be prepared. It is reported that the Los Angeles airship was built by the German Zeppelin Factory in 1924 and the construction cost was paid for with German reparations. The only airship of the U.S. Navy in the future is the Macon, which is the largest airship in the world. (11th, Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>Britain Expands Air Force Plan, Adds 500 Aircraft Within Five Years, to Be on Par With France</h3>
<p>(London) Britain's major air force expansion plan stipulates the construction of 1,000 aircraft for the army and navy. Acting Prime Minister Baldwin will formally submit it to Congress before the summer. According to newspaper reports, the content of the plan is as follows: The five-year air force plan is to achieve a balance of air forces between Britain and France by 1940. By 1940, the British Air Force will add 500 new aircraft and form 50 squadrons. This plan is not affected by the international situation. The air force budget for 1935 may increase by 1 million pounds, and then 500 new aircraft will be added each year. However, the exact number will depend on the results of next year's naval conference. About 12 to 15 new airfields will be built throughout the country. The British colonial troops will also be equipped with bombers and pursuit aircraft to complete the backbone of air defense. (12th, National News dispatch)</p>
<h3>United States Actively Builds Aircraft, Greatly Improves Speed and Materials, to Suit Long-Distance and Dangerous Flights</h3>

U.S. contractors are currently rushing to build aircraft for the 16 people participating in the competition, but the number of participants will not be limited to this number. What contractors are paying attention to is this major flight rather than the competitors. They are now pouring their full efforts into this and will use it to announce the speed and materials of American aircraft to the world. This competition will give American male and female aviators the opportunity to fly over a dangerous course of 12,000 miles in super aircraft. About 60 people have registered with the Royal Aeronautical Society in London. (12th, National News dispatch)</p>

<h3>Building Aviation Floating Stations in the Atlantic</h3>
<p>(Washington) On November 16 of last year, the U.S. Secretary of Commerce announced that the government had allocated 1.5 million yuan from the public works fund to build a floating airfield on the surface of the water 880 kilometers from the coast in the Atlantic Ocean. If the test is good, then floating airfields will continue to be set up every 880 kilometers on the ocean surface between Europe and the Americas in order to ensure the safety of air traffic between the two continents. Since the establishment of this plan, public works department personnel have earnestly studied and plan to install several seats in the Azores and Bermuda in the Atlantic Ocean. Recently, the Department of Commerce has requested the Department of Public Works to promptly allocate funds for implementation. We can see from this plan that the United States wants to establish a large number of aviation stations in the Atlantic Ocean, connecting them into a line. The government declared that most workers can obtain work through this project, and once completed, the United States will be five to ten years ahead of other countries in this regard. This floating aviation station is the property of the United States, but aircraft of any nationality can use it without distinction. (11th, Havas dispatch)</p>

<h3>Relationship Between New Japanese Government and Political Parties, Okada Visits Presidents of Three Parties, Army Minister Hayashi Holds Military Conference</h3>

In order to unify national opinion first for next year's disarmament conference, each political party is aware of the overall situation, thinks, and has no different opinions on this theory, but the Seiyukai has long refused to join the cabinet and openly raised its banner of resistance against the government, I am afraid that the relationship will not be improved due to the Prime Minister's ceremonial occasions, and the result will inevitably progress to convening a temporary parliament and announcing the dissolution at the same time. Therefore, the relationship between the government and political parties in the future is extremely noteworthy. (12th, Japan Associated Press dispatch)</p>

According to war news from the front, the fierceness of the war is unprecedented since the start of the war in June 1932, and there is no hope of deciding the outcome. The mediation of third countries has also not yielded any results. (11th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>German Parliament Scheduled to Convene This Friday, Hitler Will Issue Foreign Policy Declaration, Barden's Position No Longer What It Was</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Premier Hitler's convocation of the House of Representatives to meet on Friday has attracted great attention from political and diplomatic circles. It is generally said that many members of the House of Representatives were shot in the coup on June 30. At that time, many members of the House will be absent. As for government personnel, they will not be able to attend the entire court, because Party Army Chief of Staff Rohm has been shot, Economy Minister Schmidt is currently on vacation, and Vice Premier Papen will probably not be able to attend. At this meeting of the House of Representatives, the German people and people all over the world hope that Hitler can explain the so-called conspiracy rebellion cases on June 30 and July 1 and 2. Some people think that Mr. X or will be the list of names of the people executed in the past few days and formally report to the public.</p>
<p>In addition to this, Mr. X's declaration on foreign policy issues will also be of great significance. It is also rumored in political circles that Mr. X will declare in some form that Germany will return to Geneva to participate in the League of Nations Assembly and disarmament conference. It is generally believed that the reason why Mr. X's foreign policy has changed so fundamentally is the result of the meeting with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in Venice in mid-June. Others believe that Mr. X, in view of the recent achievements of French diplomacy, will directly express his goodwill to France when speaking in the House of Representatives on Friday, hoping to reduce the effect of French-British rapprochement in order to seek temporary security.</p>

<p>(Berlin) What Vice Premier Papen's position has been since the coup on June 30 has not been clarified so far. Judging from his conversations with close associates, he is quite saddened by this incident, especially the hasty execution of his confidant Voss and the death of his friend Jung. Although he is no longer under surveillance and those arrested around him have been released, he does not seem to be able to occupy an important position in the government again. The Vice Premier's office on Wilhelm Street has also been changed to the headquarters of the Assault Team, so he can only temporarily set up an office in a certain shop building, with extremely simple equipment. According to general opinion, he will continue to handle the Saar region incident, and the residents there are quite shocked by the June 30 incident. (11th, Havas dispatch)</p>

<h3>Barthou's Busy Itinerary - Autumn Visit to Mussolini to Discuss Mediterranean Pact, Philippine Issues to Be Resolved First</h3>
<p>Rome - Italian newspapers have expressed sympathy towards the news of French Foreign Minister Barthou's visit to Rome. The French Ambassador to Italy, Chambrun, recently departed for Paris. It is generally believed that Chambrun's trip is not to formally report Italy's invitation to Barthou, but rather to explain to Barthou that he would be very welcome if he were to visit Italy and to ascertain the French Foreign Minister's intentions. Italy hopes that Barthou will come to Rome after returning to France from London, as Italy and the United Kingdom are both guarantor states of the Locarno Treaty. The "Tribune" stated, "French Foreign Minister Barthou's visit to Italy this autumn to meet with Mussolini seems to be a certainty. It is reported that Barthou, with considerable reservations, will concede to Italy on two issues: one concerning the boundary affairs of Italian Libya in Africa, and the other concerning the status of Italians in French Tunisia (Note: Italian Libya in Africa borders French Tunisia). Barthou's attitude aims to clarify the atmosphere so that France and Italy can clearly consider the Mediterranean regional pact." In recent days, Italian newspapers have stated that Italy has not heard of nor wishes to hear of the plans for a Mediterranean regional pact. The situation has changed today. Former explicit opposition has now turned into a willingness to study whether such a pact would be beneficial. (Havas dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<h3>Mutual Assistance Pact: Britain Will Strive for Its Success, Informing Governments Through Diplomatic Channels</h3>
<p>(London) - The principle of a regional mutual assistance pact, advocated by France, has been endorsed by the British authorities after French Foreign Minister Barthou explained it. The British government now intends to immediately instruct British representatives in various countries to explain to the governments of their host countries that Britain has already endorsed this plan, and would be very pleased if other countries could also endorse it. This is the method decided upon at this morning's cabinet meeting. During the discussion, some cabinet members believed that it would not be appropriate for Britain to directly contact various countries; it would be better for France to first contact the countries concerned. However, the majority of cabinet members believed that under the current circumstances, the British government should proceed with this contact, hence the final decision. It is generally believed that the Foreign Office will immediately send this instruction to British representatives abroad. (Havas dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>Warsaw - According to a London dispatch published in the "Illustrated Mail," the British government will soon notify the Polish government through diplomatic channels that the British government supports the plan for an Eastern European regional mutual assistance pact.

<h3>Eastern Locarno: Russia Hopes for German Participation</h3>
<p>(Moscow) - Official Soviet circles believe that after French Foreign Minister Barthou's visit to Britain and advocacy, the establishment of the Eastern Locarno Treaty seems to be a certainty. However, the origin of this treaty plan and the efforts to promote it should be attributed to Litvinov. Furthermore, it is believed here that France and the Soviet Union will assume the role of guarantors of this general agreement, and the door to the agreement will be left open for those who previously refused to participate to join freely. The "Pravda" considers the recent speech by the leader of the German National Socialist Party, Hess, in Königsberg as "an expression of Germany's rapid desire to establish an understanding with foreign countries." Therefore, Moscow has high hopes that Germany will also participate in the Eastern Locarno Treaty in the future. (National Telegraphic dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<h3>Another Step Forward for Peace: French Press Praises Barthou's Achievements</h3>
<p>(Paris) - The press continues to enthusiastically comment on Barthou's trip to London. The "Echo de Paris" stated, "Barthou's ability to convince Baldwin and Simon of the legitimacy of the French plan is no small feat, as just a few days ago, we thought this would be difficult to achieve." The "Affaires" newspaper stated that the cause of European peace has taken another step forward. The "Journal" stated that Britain's permission to assist France in various ways to achieve the regional mutual assistance pact it advocates is due to Britain's understanding that this is the only way to maintain European peace. The "Echo de Paris" believes that the fate of the Disarmament Conference largely depends on the talks between Barthou, Baldwin, Simon, and Henderson on Tuesday, as the Presidium is scheduled to meet in September this year to comprehensively review the work of the four technical committees (i.e., (1) Security, (2) Supervision, (3) Aviation, and (4) Arms Manufacturing and Trafficking, established on June 11th according to the British, American, and French compromise plan). The newspaper also stated that if there are still no concrete results by the end of this year, the Disarmament Conference can truly be closed. (Havas dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<h3>Continental Hegemony: France Strengthens Invisibly, German Press Opposes Eastern Locarno, Worried About Westward Expansion of Russian Influence</h3>
<p>(Berlin) - The semi-official organ "Diplomatic Government Records" reports that after French Foreign Minister Barthou's considerable success in his recent visit to Britain, France's position in Europe has been elevated as a result. Subsequently, it will resolutely refuse disarmament and granting Germany equal rights. The "Berlin Daily News" also stated that Britain has finally agreed to move forward in the ranks of France's new alliance system, thus invisibly strengthening France's hegemony on the European continent. It is unexpected that Clemenceau's policies are now being completed by Barthou. However, it is currently difficult to predict what kind of reaction this turnabout by Britain will provoke.</p>
<p>(National News Agency dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) - German newspapers have been forcefully arguing in recent days that Barthou's trip to Britain would yield no results. However, after yesterday's Anglo-French negotiations achieved great success, their attitude suddenly changed, and they now unanimously declare that the French Foreign Minister has achieved a great victory. Some newspapers even stated that Barthou's results exceeded France's original expectations. The semi-official "Foreign Communication News" stated that since taking charge of foreign affairs, Barthou has been able to adopt a good strategy of adapting to the times with regard to Britain. However, the newspaper does not approve of France's Eastern Locarno Treaty policy, stating that this policy will make the Red Army an important factor in international politics. It said, "The internal and external relations of the two Locarno Treaties, East and West, will create danger for the countries of Central Europe and will be enough to disrupt the European balance of power, as Germany and Poland will become land occupied by Russian troops, and Bolshevism will be widely propagated to France through Poland and Germany."</p>

<h3>Security Guarantees: Emphasis Must Be Placed on Substance, Polish Press Dissatisfied with French Plan</h3>
<p>Warsaw - Regarding French Foreign Minister Barthou's advocacy in Britain, the Polish government organ "Polonia" today published a very long article, expressing clear dissatisfaction with the French guarantee plan, and calling Barthou's actions "Alliance Fever." The newspaper added that after the completion of this alliance, at most it would only be an expansion of the illusion of security. Finally, the newspaper indicated that what Poland supports is another method, namely, a treaty established in good faith by both parties, clearly stipulating substantive guarantees, and not merely settling for conditional guarantees.

<h3>Close Franco-Romanian Relations: Romanian Prime Minister Meets with French Foreign Minister, Paying Special Attention to Mutual Assistance Pact Plan</h3>
<p>(Paris) - Romanian Prime Minister Tatarescu, accompanied by the country's ambassador to France and the director of Tatarescu's private office, visited Foreign Minister Barthou at the Foreign Ministry at 5:00 PM today for over half an hour of talks. Tatarescu did not make any declaration upon leaving the Foreign Ministry. (Havas dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Paris) - When Foreign Minister Barthou met with Romanian Prime Minister Tatarescu this afternoon, the conversation was extremely cordial, sufficient to indicate the closeness of Franco-Romanian relations and the private friendship between Foreign Minister Barthou and Prime Minister Tatarescu. The plan for a mutual assistance pact between various countries has received the agreement and assistance of Britain, which has been especially noted by the Romanian government, as Romanian foreign policy is decided by the country's Foreign Minister Titulescu, who is one of the initiators of the mutual assistance pact policy. We still remember the enthusiastic welcome that Barthou received from the Romanian government and people during his recent visit to Bucharest. Not long after, Romanian Prime Minister Tatarescu followed suit and came to France, which is enough to indicate the closeness of the two countries' relations. (Havas dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Paris) - Romanian Prime Minister Tatarescu's current visit to France does not have any new significance in itself, in terms of Franco-Romanian consultations, as the establishment of consultations between the two countries has been going on for many years, not just since today. What is fortunate is that Barthou has just returned from London with honors, and the King of Romania, Carol, will soon come to France again. Tatarescu happened to arrive at this time, which is of great relevance to the development of Franco-Romanian cooperation. (Havas dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<h3>Spain and Russia Reconcile: Plan to Send Envoys to Moscow</h3>
<p>Madrid - Since the rumor that the Soviet Union will join the League of Nations, the Spanish government has been planning to dispatch an envoy to be stationed permanently in Moscow in order to reconcile with Soviet Russia.

However, the Moscow government has not yet sought the opinion of the Spanish government. (Havas dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<h3>American Wheat Shortage</h3>
<p>Chicago - Grain statistics experts today predicted that the surplus of American wheat will be greatly reduced, and that by next July, there may even be a dangerous situation where wheat must be imported from foreign countries to meet demand. This prediction is based on the statistics released by the Department of Agriculture yesterday. The Department of Agriculture's statistics indicate that this year's wheat production will be the lowest since 1894. Last year's production was 527,413,000 bushels, but this year it will be reduced to 483,662,000 bushels. Moreover, the return of the heatwave to the West is very dangerous for the harvest. Those familiar with the situation believe that the world food problem is now very serious. The price of wheat has already soared by five cents per bushel today. Due to legal restrictions, it cannot rise further. According to stock exchange brokers, it is expected that it will rise another five cents tomorrow, and then perhaps it will turn back slightly due to speculators' interests.

<h3>No Further News on Sven Hedin's Whereabouts</h3>
<p>(Peiping) - There is no further news on Dr. Sven Hedin's whereabouts. A telegram from his sister in the capital of Sweden also expressed hope that the news of her brother's abduction, which refers to the previous dispute with Ma Zhongying, is true.

<h3>Hu Shi-ze's Remarks in Beiping</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Hu Shi-ze told reporters on the 12th that the economic panic and political instability in European countries are now a widespread phenomenon. All countries are burying themselves in internal reorganization, and there is unlikely to be any external development at present. When I attended the League of Nations Opium Advisory Committee some time ago, all countries paid close attention to the anti-drug situation in the Far East. The American representative sympathized with us and once expressed dissatisfaction. After detailed explanation, he finally understood. I then put forward three solutions: (1) Nationals enjoying consular jurisdiction who sell opium and narcotics in other countries, if caught, may be escorted back to their home country by their own government and not allowed to come again; (2) Increase the penalties for sellers, including imprisonment and fines; (3) If a ship sailing on inland rivers under a foreign flag is found to be involved in drug trafficking, the national flag will immediately lose its protection. The above three items have been approved by the committee and notified to the governments of all member states for implementation. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 12th)</p>

<h3>Serious Flood Situation in the Xiang River Basin of Hubei Province, Riverbanks Continue to Collapse in Tianmen, Mianyang, Qianjiang, and Jingzhou Counties, Shi Yuling and Lei Xiaocen Telegraph Disaster Situation</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence, After the Xiang River flooded and the embankments burst, resulting in a major disaster, the Eastern Jing River embankment also collapsed, and the situation is becoming increasingly serious. The embankments of Mashi, Qingshi, Hongcun, Jinmao, Yinhu, Yangzi Yangzhuang, Sanjiao, and Shihe in Mianyang County are collapsing one after another, like a broken bamboo. From Mianyang in the upper reaches to Shahu in the lower reaches, everything has become a watery realm. Xiantao Town, Oujiawan, and Zhouhe have also been submerged. The embankments of the Chailin River and Tongshun River are all in danger of collapsing at any moment. When the Oujiawan embankment collapsed, unemployed vagrants took advantage of the chaos to harass Xiantao, setting fire to more than 60 houses and burning a child to death. The suffering of being in deep water and fire is truly unimaginable. At the same time, the Zhihe Road people's embankment shared by Jiangling and Qianjiang, and the main embankment below Yuekou in Tianmen, also collapsed due to the high water level, and the disaster area is spreading wider and wider. Shi Yuling, the administrative commissioner of the 6th district, and Lei Xiaocen, the administrative commissioner of the 7th district, both telegraphed the provincial government yesterday to report the situation. Shi's telegram briefly stated that the main embankment in the Shuanghu Yuan Hou Nanwa area, 15 li below Yuekou, collapsed severely due to the failure of the public works office to provide disaster prevention materials in time, making rescue impossible. For a time, the waves were surging and unstoppable. Officials were sent to survey the flooded area, which included about 25 forts in the 2nd district, about 160 forts in the 4th district, and about 100 forts in the 5th district. The water depth ranged from 5 feet to more than 1 zhang. Houses collapsed, livestock drowned, and food and clothing were mostly washed away. The water is still pooling, and the people have moved to the main embankments of the Xiang River and the Niuti tributary, camping in the open air and eating in the wind, in an extremely miserable state. In addition to proper condolences, I respectfully request prompt emergency relief. Lei's telegram briefly stated that the Zhihe Road people's embankment in Jiangling is related to the interests of several counties, so special attention is paid to repairing the embankment every year. This year, the water势 was too rapid, with two breaches in Jiangling and one breach adjacent to Qianjiang. Details are being investigated. After receiving the telegrams, Zhang Qun, Chairman of the Provincial Government, immediately ordered the Department of Civil Affairs to send personnel to the field to conduct an on-site survey and coordinate relief efforts. Yang Silian, Director of the River Engineering Bureau, is scheduled to go up the Yangtze River from Hankou on the 12th to inspect the embankments in Xiangyang and supervise the emergency repairs.

<h3>After the Recapture of Guangchang, the National Army Awaits Orders to Advance, Eliminating Remnant Bandits and Expanding the Administrative Area, Political Rehabilitation Work is Quite Successful</h3>
<p>Guangchang Correspondence: Since the recapture of Guangchang, the morale of the front-line troops has been high. The remnant bandits in the county will soon be eliminated. The military progress is gratifying. The political rehabilitation, such as the accommodation of refugees, the return of reformed elements, the promotion of the sanitation movement, and the training of Baojia chiefs, are all noteworthy. Detailed records are provided separately below:</p>
<p>The deputy commander of a certain route arrived in the county at 4:00 p.m. on the 2nd of this month. Personnel from various divisions and regiments and various agencies gathered at the station to welcome him. Then, a welcome meeting was held at the headquarters. The deputy commander gave encouraging instructions and then inquired about the county's political and military situation. The representatives reported in detail. Since then, the morale has been greatly boosted. The next day, Toupo was recaptured. Other divisions are concentrating and awaiting orders to advance. It is said that the remnant bandits in the county will be eliminated and the administrative area expanded in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>The number of refugees stranded in Guangchang has reached more than 5,000, and the rear reception center is trying to provide relief. After the recapture of Toupo, the refugees in the area continued to return to work, most of them overjoyed, celebrating having a home to return to. The bandits who reformed themselves came one after another. As of the end of June, there were a total of 521 people, most of whom were lower-level officers and soldiers such as the heads of pseudo-townships and districts, representatives, and members of the pseudo-guerrilla model battalion pioneers. Each reformed element underwent rigorous interrogation and was granted rehabilitation according to law. It is said that the county government gave individual talks to the reformed elements to make them thoroughly aware of their mistakes and to actively participate in the bandit suppression work.</p>
<p>At 10:00 a.m. on the 5th, the second sanitation movement meeting was held at the bus station. In advance, the troops, agencies, and people's organizations paraded in formation and returned to the meeting place. After performing the ceremony, Guo, chief of staff of the 18th Army, chairman of the meeting, announced the reasons for the meeting. The representatives continued to speak, emphasizing the need to pay attention to the health of the military and civilians during the bandit suppression period, otherwise, if epidemics spread, they would perish without being attacked by the enemy. County Magistrate Wu then told the people present that from today onwards, a general cleaning would be carried out. Anyone who violated the sanitation movement regulations would be punished without leniency. The masses were especially wary. Finally, they shouted slogans, took photos, and dispersed.</p>
<p>At 2:00 p.m. on the 5th, the graduation ceremony for the trainees of the Baojia training class was held. County Magistrate Wu, chairman of the meeting, and the guests all gave speeches, encouraging the trainees to put what they had learned into practice, take responsibility, overcome difficulties, thoroughly investigate the household registration, strictly implement the Baojia system, and eliminate sporadic bandits, so as not to fail the heavy responsibility of the Bao chiefs. After the speeches, County Magistrate Wu issued graduation certificates. After the ceremony, photos were taken, and tea and refreshments were served before everyone departed. (July 11)</p>
<h3>Third Province Bandit Suppression Headquarters Issues Order Prohibiting Embezzlement of Security Team Salaries</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Zhang Xueliang, Deputy Commander of the Bandit Suppression Headquarters of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui Provinces, believes that the security teams in various counties were originally established to protect the people, but in the border counties, local tyrants often take advantage of this for their own benefit, even taking advantage of their inability to pay salaries, so as to collect money from the local area, leaving the people in misery and without recourse. In order to eliminate this abuse, the headquarters has issued an order to the three provinces, prohibiting embezzlement and profiteering, and preventing the dispatch of troops to harass the people. The original order is as follows: It is found that the regulations for reorganizing the local finances of the counties in the bandit suppression area stipulate that the expenses of the agencies under the jurisdiction of each county shall be collected and disbursed uniformly by the Finance Committee. In addition, Article 17 of the regulations on the reorganization of the people's regiments in the bandit suppression area states that the salaries of officers and soldiers of the security teams in each county shall be paid jointly by the county government and the Finance Committee after roll call. According to the original intention of the legislation, it was intended to eliminate the long-standing practice of solicitation and prevent the flow of embezzlement. At the beginning of implementation, it was deeply feared that the understanding was not genuine, so strict warnings were issued to the relevant responsible officials on how to conscientiously implement it in order to achieve good governance. However, it has been reported that in some counties, although salaries have been issued to the security teams, the lower-level officers and soldiers have not actually received them. Some officers and soldiers, because they have not received their salaries, are still extorting and harassing the people. It can be imagined that someone is embezzling and profiteering, engaging in malfeasance and private gain. This is a contempt for the regulations and a disregard for the law, which is extremely hateful. In addition to separate orders, this order is urgently issued to the provincial government to instruct the Security Department to strictly investigate and prohibit it, and to investigate and deal with it at any time, without any negligence, and to report the handling situation. This order. (11th)</p>
<h3>Recent Progress on the Xihu Road Construction, The Entire Line is 221 Miles Long, The Cost is Approximately 1.7 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang News: Since the Construction Department of Jiangsu Province appointed Mei Chengzhang, a technical officer of the department, to concurrently serve as the chief engineer of the Xihu Road, the general engineering office was established in Wuxi in early April, and branch offices were established in Wuxi, Changshu, and Jiading to implement the construction. The project is progressing smoothly. Recently, Director Shen of the Construction Department and Section Chief Wu of the responsible section are even more concerned about the progress of the road construction in view of the upcoming Southeast Five Provinces Transportation Conference. In addition to ordering Director Mei to complete the project within a time limit, they also personally visited the construction site from time to time to inspect the progress. Director Mei informed that the hot weather in recent days has had a slight impact on work efficiency. He has ordered all contractors on the entire line to increase night work to facilitate progress. The progress of the road construction is described approximately as follows:</p>
<p>▲Overall Route: The route of the road is composed of the Xichang section of the Yixing Changshu branch line and the Changhu section of the Jinghu main line. From west to east, it extends into a major trunk line in the south of the Yangtze River, starting from Zhoushanbang in the north of Wuxi City, passing through Dongting, Anzhen, Yangjian, and Liantang, and reaching the south of Changshu City, where it is connected to the Suzhou-Chang Road under construction. From here, it encircles the city and goes east, passing along the Qingdun Pond through Guli Village, Baimao Zhizhang, and Mizhen, and entering the territory of Taicang. It then turns south along the Yantietang, passing through Zhitang and Shuangfeng, and reaching outside Taicang City. It then passes through Xinfeng Gelong and enters Jiading territory. From here, it goes east through Waigang to the south of Jiading City, and then turns south to pass through Malu and Nanxiang, and connects with the Xiangzhen Road to form a line to enter Shanghai territory. The total length of the entire line is 129.950 kilometers, approximately equal to 221 Chinese miles.</p>
<p>▲Bridges and Culverts: In addition to the original 22 wooden bridges, 147 new bridges need to be built along the entire line. All bridge piers and abutments are constructed using pile frame and pile board styles, using reinforced concrete to ensure permanence. Due to limited funding, the girders and bridge decks will temporarily use foreign pine structures. The culverts include reinforced concrete circular pipe style, reinforced concrete cover plate style, and stone arch culverts. In addition to the existing 30 corrugated iron pipes, more than 60 culverts and 260 water pipes need to be built along the entire line. The road surface will use crushed brick or crushed stone base gravel road surface, and the road width is temporarily set at 5.5 meters. The total area of the entire road is approximately 700,000 square meters.</p>
<p>▲Cost Estimate: The cost of the entire road includes approximately 700,000 yuan for bridges, 40,000 yuan for culverts, 870,000 yuan for road surface, and fees for surveying, earthwork, and supervision, totaling approximately 1.7 million yuan.</p>
<p>▲Project Progress: The earthwork project is constructed by conscripting or hiring workers from the counties along the line, supervised by the engineering office. Except for the Wuxi section, which has been completed, the rest are also being completed partially or are being rushed. It is expected that it will be completed within this month. The bridge and culvert projects in the Wuxi county territory are all contracted by the Zhongnan Company. In the Changshu county territory, the bridges are contracted by the Yuqing Company, and the culverts are contracted by Shen Rongji. Since the start of these projects in late April, all cement piles have been poured, and the pile driving project is 50% complete, and several have been completely completed. In addition, the bridge project in the Taihu section has also been contracted by the Zhongnan and Yuqing construction companies, and the culverts have been contracted by Xu Wenji. All are planning to start construction or are working hard to move forward.</p>
<p>▲Management Organization: Mei Chengzhang, the director of the office, divided the entire road into three sections for the convenience of management. The first section is located in the Wuxi General Engineering Office, and the second and third sections are located in Changshu and Jiading. Each section is equipped with a section chief who also serves as a deputy engineer, an assistant engineer, several engineers, supervisors, and employees. The General Engineering Office is divided into two sections: General Affairs and Engineering. The Engineering Section is equipped with a deputy engineer, an assistant engineer, and engineers. The General Affairs Section is staffed by clerks and employees. (10th)</p>

<h3>Robbery of the Wang Family in Jinshanwei</h3>
<p>Wang Yinhe’s family in Sanjiaoyang, Jinshanwei, is a moderately prosperous family. Recently, they were collecting association fees, which was overheard by bandits. On the evening of the 9th, five or six bandits suddenly broke into the house, tied up all the family members, and tortured Wang Yinhe to force him to reveal the location of the silver. When neighbors heard the alarm and beat the gong, the bandits fired shots in the direction of the gong, deterring the neighbors from gathering. The bandits looted at will for over an hour before leaving with a howl. The injured Wang Yinhe is currently receiving medical treatment.</p>

<h3>Suzhou: Villagers Misunderstand and Assault Surveyors</h3>
<p>Recently, a survey team from the Land Bureau, led by surveyor Wu Xiangmeng, was surveying fields in the Mingtou Township area of Mu’du. Farmers in the township mistakenly believed that the government was seizing private land. Consequently, over a hundred villagers gathered and made things difficult for the surveyors, eventually resorting to violence. As a result, several surveyors were injured, and Wu Xiangmeng was also beaten.</p>
<h3>Agreed Disaster Prevention Measures</h3>
<p>The drought and extreme heat here continue. The highest recorded temperature reached 104.2 degrees on the afternoon of the 11th at 5:00 PM. River ferries such as Xiangshan, Guangfu, Hangzhou, Huzhou, and others have successively suspended operations. The Changshu ferry only operates as far as Luxu in Suxiang. According to the Taihu Water Conservancy Committee, since receiving 14.6 millimeters of rainfall on May 19th, it has been two months without significant rain. Rice prices have risen to a high of eleven yuan per stone. Various villages are reporting famine, and the drinking water supply in the urban area is particularly problematic. The county government convened a disaster prevention meeting yesterday (the 12th) morning and resolved to: (1) Irrigate farmland. In rural areas, use water-drawing machines. In urban areas, use rice-husking machines and fire pumps. (2) Regarding the drinking water problem, it was decided to dredge existing public wells and dig new wells in key locations. It was also decided to raise 50,000 yuan, jointly funded by the government and local communities, for digging wells and purchasing water-drawing machines. As for opening a water gate at Xumen, it was decided to postpone the discussion due to the limited water flow in the Xujiang River and the extensive scale of the project.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: County Government Convenes Drought Relief Meeting</h3>
<p>The weather is extremely dry, rivers are drying up, and a major famine is imminent, causing widespread anxiety. Officials and merchants in Wujin have petitioned to open the Dongba Dam to divert water downstream. However, the counties of Suzhou, Wuxi, and Liyang believe that opening the Dongba Dam would cause a rapid outflow of water, severely affecting water conservancy in the Wu region. Therefore, they unanimously advocate for careful consideration. The Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the provincial government yesterday, requesting careful consideration. It is now reported that the Suzhou Construction Department has decided not to open the Dongba Dam. The Wuxi County Government convened a drought relief meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday, where district chiefs reported on the drought situation. At most, only 50-60% of the rice seedlings have been planted, and upland fields are beyond saving. After discussion, it was resolved: (1) The key to drought relief is dredging the main channels to the Yangtze River. However, this concerns the interests of several counties and should be handled carefully by the provincial government. (2) Huangtiangang is a key channel connecting the Yangtze River to Wuxi and should be dredged with a request to the provincial government. The Construction Bureau should also coordinate with the Jiangyin Construction Bureau to open the sluice gates. (3) The Mountain Construction Bureau should supervise the Agricultural Extension Institute to build dams and pump water as needed. (4) Each district should prioritize dredging river channels. (5) Upland fields affected by the drought should be replanted with buckwheat. (6) Drought relief expenses should be requested from the provincial government under the industry and construction budget. At the same time, the county government issued three announcements: (1) A three-day ban on slaughtering will be implemented from the 13th to the 15th of this month, as a traditional practice to appeal for favorable weather. (2) Rural river channels should be dredged quickly, prioritizing rapid construction. (3) If there are difficulties in pumping water for farmland, it should be reported to the district chief for coordination. Yesterday, the outdoor temperature was still 110 degrees. Many fish in the park's pond died from the heat. In the Xiadian Bridge Township area of Chao Yin Township in the Second District, a dam was built at the Xiadian Bridge creek to pump water from the canal to irrigate farmland. In the Shuitangwan area of Wan’an City, plays were performed and offerings were made to the gods to pray for rain.</p>
<h3>Changshu: County Government Holds Drought Prevention Meeting</h3>
<p>This county has been experiencing a prolonged drought, preventing the planting of rice seedlings and causing a disaster. Farmers in various townships have reported the disaster to the county government. To provide drought relief, the county government convened a drought prevention meeting on the afternoon of the 11th. Over fifty people attended, including district chiefs, representatives from various agencies, the director of the agricultural station, and local gentry. The county magistrate presided over the meeting, and the following key resolutions were made: (2) 32,000 yuan from the famine relief fund will be used to purchase twenty water-drawing machine boats, which will be distributed to various districts. (3) Shallow and dry areas of river channels and tributaries should be quickly dredged or dams should be built to intercept tides, with each district handling it separately. (4) If rented water-drawing boats violate their contracts, the public security branch will handle the matter. Machine boats already within the county's borders must not be allowed to leave. (5) A request should be sent to the fire brigades in the urban area to assist in pumping water. (6) Efforts should be made to plant miscellaneous grains in farmland where rice seedlings cannot be planted. (7) Yu Jiusi and Pan Jiasun were appointed to draft the drought relief association's charter. (8) Measures should be taken to prevent the rising rice prices. The discussion lasted for three hours before the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin: Zhejiang Provincial Government Issues Arrest Warrant for Shen Huaihang</h3>
<p>Shen Huaihang, the former director of the agricultural station, failed to complete the handover after his dismissal. He then took a position as the director of the sericulture model area and the nursery keeper in Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang. After the county government reported this to the Construction Department of the provincial government, the matter was referred to the Zhejiang Provincial Government, which approved the issuance of an arrest warrant. Shen Huaihang had absconded with 400 yuan of public funds and abandoned his post. An order has been issued for his arrest, and a request has been made to seize his family property in his original hometown to cover the losses. County Magistrate Bao, upon receiving the order, instructed the investigation team of the Public Security Bureau to investigate Shen's whereabouts and ordered his family to appoint someone to be responsible for the clearing of the account and report it.</p>
<h3>Omission of Miscellaneous Taxes from Budget: Finance Department Orders Disapproval</h3>
<p>The provincial order mandates the reduction of excessive miscellaneous taxes. The urban area surtax in this county is used for district affairs, the cocoon surtax is used for charitable expenses, and the fish surtax is used for security, ferry services, streetlights, and street cleaning, all of which serve a purpose. Previously, these were not included in the county's local budget. On June 21st, local agencies requested the county to petition the Finance Department to temporarily postpone the cancellation. The Finance Department now instructs that the budget is of paramount importance and cannot be ignored. Since the department convened a meeting and submitted a request to the provincial government, which was approved, it should be implemented according to the budget. Taxes not included in the budget should not be collected or spent without authorization. If the purpose is deemed necessary, why was it not included at the time? Now that the budget has been set, it cannot be changed. The request should not be considered.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang: Suzhou Construction Department Focuses on Drought Disaster</h3>
<p>Shen Baixian, the director of the Suzhou Construction Department, recognizing the severity of the drought and the difficulty in planting rice seedlings in the counties south of the Yangtze River, intends to instruct farmers in the region to switch to drought-resistant crops such as beans, buckwheat, sorghum, mung beans, and potatoes if there is no rain. The main strategies are: (1) The county government will raise funds to purchase seeds and distribute them at low prices. (2) Personnel from provincial and county agricultural stations will be dispatched to provide guidance on planting methods and cultivation plans. At the same time, the Suzhou Agricultural Implement Manufacturing Plant is ordered to lend out all available water pumps to farmers to meet their urgent needs.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Two District Chiefs Removed to the Province</h3>
<p>The provincial government previously received a secret report stating that Ding Ziyan, the district chief of Yiyu Autonomous District in Nantong, and Chen Youqi, the district chief of Yudong Autonomous District, were suspected of involvement in the murder of a district resident named Tang. Upon receiving the report, the government, considering the seriousness of the case, dispatched an investigator to verify the facts. Recently, Director Wang was dispatched, along with a guard, by boat to the county to work with Zheng, the commissioner of the Nantong Security District, and County Magistrate Jin to arrest Ding Ziyan and Chen Youqi, who are being held at the county government. Due to the suspicion that accomplices Tang Dazong, Tang Caizong, Tang Xianchen, Jiang Zhaoxian, and others were involved in the conspiracy, Commissioner Wang personally led a team to the district to arrest them. They were immediately taken to the county. Yesterday, Director Wang escorted Chen Youqi, Li Ziyan, and others by boat to the province for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Villagers Pray for Rain</h3>
<p>Villagers in the Qilidian area of the western township, due to the drought and lack of rain, have seen most of the planted seedlings wither, and there is no way to pump water where seeds have not been sown. The villagers have gathered in large numbers to hold a Dragon King Festival to pray for rain. On the 11th, they entered the city through the west gate and went directly to the county government to plead with the county magistrate to inspect the disaster and request that he order all butchers to cease slaughtering immediately. County Magistrate Ma instructed the security team to inform the villagers that praying for rain is a public interest matter and they should not gather in large groups. He asked them to return to their villages to avoid causing trouble. The villagers then left the city to burn incense at Guanyin Mountain before dispersing.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of the County Security Team Completed</h3>
<p>The Jiangdu County Police Force was inspected on the 4th by Luo Yi, the inspection director of the Su-Gan region, and Yan Ming, an envoy from the Security Department, along with the police from Jiangpu, Liuhe, Yizheng, Gaoyou, Taixing, and Taixian. A total of 752 officers and soldiers from the seven counties attended, with Lu Dajun, the deputy commander of the Jiangdu Security Regiment, serving as the commander. The county security team has been completely reorganized. The original two companies and six platoons remain unchanged. The water patrol team and special operations team have been reorganized into independent platoons. The entire county security regiment has been reorganized into the Third Company, with jurisdiction over three platoons and two independent platoons. Except for the independent platoon reorganized from the water patrol team, which has only three squads, the rest have four squads. Each squad consists of 13 officers and police. Except for the water patrol team leader Yuan and the Xie platoon leader stationed at Huojiaqiao, who were previously ordered to be replaced, all others remain the same.</p>
<h3>Jiashan: Legal Representatives Travel to Province to Request Water Pumps</h3>
<p>The drought in this county is severe. All the rice paddies in the county have cracked open, and the water level in the major rivers has dropped, making irrigation impossible. Yesterday, the county government convened an emergency drought prevention meeting, resolving to use all 4,509 yuan from the disaster preparedness, grain reserve, and silkworm management funds to purchase water pumps. The water pumping area will prioritize the Dayun and Zhanghui districts. The three water pumps owned by the county government have already been dispatched to the Dayun district for water pumping. According to a telegram from Xia Chong, a staff member of the Civil Affairs Department of the Provincial Government, to the county party headquarters, the fifty water pumps prepared by the provincial government have been claimed by various counties that urgently requested them. It was mentioned that only this county remained silent and did not report problems, and it was wondered if the county had already received abundant rainfall. The Provincial Government will continue to purchase thirty water pumps, and this county is urged to send representatives to the province to claim the pumps as soon as possible, or it will be too late. Upon receiving the telegram, the county party headquarters, along with forty legal representatives from the entire county, sent a joint telegram to the provincial government requesting assistance. Gu Guanle and Tuan Wenjin were selected as representatives and took the first train to the province to make a direct appeal. However, the crops in the surrounding villages have already withered, and even if sufficient water is obtained, it may be impossible to save them.</p>
<h3>Huzhou: Tong’an Ferry Boat Robbed at Wuyuan Ferry</h3>
<p>The Meixi-based Xintong’an ferry boat of the Cheng Anxiao Ferry Bureau departed from Huzhou yesterday morning at 7:00 AM, carrying over twenty passengers bound for Meixi. When it reached the Xucang Bridge, three passengers boarded the boat. However, when it reached the Wuyuan Ferry, each of the three passengers pulled out wooden-cased guns and, speaking with a Henan accent, proceeded to rob each passenger in turn, with no one spared. At that time, a business card belonging to Li Yuannian, the detective chief of the stationed Huzhou Teaching Brigade, was found in the rattan basket of one of the passengers. The bandits immediately identified him as a detective and shot him in the face with a wooden-cased gun. The bullet entered through his right cheek and exited through his left cheek, causing a profuse amount of bleeding. He immediately collapsed in a pool of blood. The bandits then went ashore and fled. The total loss of passengers is estimated at over 600 silver dollars. When the boat returned, the shot passenger gradually regained consciousness midway. Upon arriving at the pier, the ferry bureau arranged for him to be taken to the Gospel Hospital for treatment. It is reported that his life is in danger. The name of the passenger is Tan Zhengkuan, from Henan. After the incident, the ferry bureau telegraphed the stationed Huzhou Teaching Brigade and the County Public Security Bureau to pursue and arrest the bandits.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan: Elderly Woman Commits Suicide Due to Drought and Desperation</h3>
<p>Since the Summer Solstice, Xiaoshan has been experiencing extremely sunny and rainless weather, causing the fields in the surrounding villages to crack, making it difficult to plant rice seedlings. Now that the Minor Heat solar term has passed, 50-60% of the fields in the southwest villages have not been planted. Farmers are exhausted from pumping water, barely managing to maintain the planted seedlings, while the rest are left to wither. On the afternoon of the 10th, farmers surnamed Cao fought over a water-pumping pier, resulting in a brawl. At the time, the Cao elderly woman, due to the extremely sunny weather and the difficulty in pumping water, felt hopeless about the farmland. She committed suicide by drowning herself in the West Xiaojiang River that evening. Although she was rescued, she had already died by the time she was brought ashore.</p>
<h3>Xuzhou: All Sectors of Xiaoxian County Appeal for Justice in the Wulouzhai Massacre</h3>

Local public groups have jointly petitioned the Central Party Headquarters, requesting that the Military Affairs Commission severely punish the officers and soldiers responsible for the violence and provide compensation to the families of the deceased.</p>

<h3>Famous Pilot Nahmacher Dies Tragically – New Aircraft of the United-American Company – Exploded During Yesterday’s Test Flight – Another Assistant Suffered Only Minor Injuries</h3>
<p>At 6:00 PM yesterday, while the United-American Aircraft Company was test flying its newly assembled aircraft at the Hongqiao Airport, the engine suddenly exploded. The pilot, American Nahmacher, was killed on the spot. Another assistant safely descended by parachute and suffered only minor injuries. The aircraft was completely destroyed. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Six New Aircraft</h3>
<p>The United-American Aircraft Company is a large-scale company. Recently, six new aircraft were shipped from the United States and transported to Hongqiao Airport three days ago. Three aircraft were assembled yesterday. Nahmacher, the company's most excellent pilot, and his assistant personally inspected them and were satisfied. Therefore, at 5:40 PM yesterday, he personally piloted one of the newly assembled aircraft with an American assistant and took off for a test flight.</p>
<h3>Engine Explosion</h3>
<p>After Nahmacher boarded the aircraft, he performed test flights in the sky for a long time. At about 6:00 PM, when flying over the Zhoujiazui Bridge, he was performing aerobatic maneuvers when the engine suddenly exploded. Only wisps of green smoke were seen, and one of Nahmacher's arms first fell from the sky. The aircraft then descended in a spiral and crashed to the ground, completely destroyed. At the same time, the American assistant sitting behind the pilot, seeing that an accident had occurred, quickly jumped out of the aircraft and floated down safely with a parachute, suffering only minor injuries.</p>
<h3>Sent to the Funeral Parlor</h3>
<p>After the accident, the airport care personnel rushed to rescue. The aircraft was completely destroyed. The pilot, Nahmacher, was covered in blood and gore, and his arms and head were incomplete. The situation was extremely tragic. The company was notified by telegram, and a hearse was sent to transport the body to the International Funeral Parlor for temporary storage.</p>
<h3>Famous Aviator</h3>
<p>The pilot who died on the spot, Cail Nahmmacher, was a first-class American aviator. He traveled between Beijing, Hangzhou, and Shanghai to perform flying techniques, which were highly praised by the authorities. His tragic death this time is a cause for regret.</p>
<h3>This Year's Municipal Public Bonds – Officially Issued on the 17th – The National Government's Approval Should Arrive in Shanghai Soon – Everything is Being Rushed for the Issuance Procedures – A Groundbreaking Ceremony is Scheduled for the Great Stadium</h3>
<p>According to the Shen Shi News Agency, the 3.5 million yuan municipal public bonds for the 23rd year of the Republic of China have been passed by the Legislative Yuan and it has now been decided to officially issue them on the 17th. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Municipal Public Bonds Issued on the 17th</h3>
<p>According to a person in charge of the Municipal Finance Bureau, the issuance of these public bonds was originally scheduled for the 15th, but due to the current situation, it had to be postponed for two days. Although the Legislative Yuan has already passed this case, the approval from the National Government has not yet arrived in Shanghai. The Finance Bureau is currently consulting with the financial community on the issuance procedures. As soon as the official order arrives in Shanghai, it will be issued promptly. Reporters also learned from relevant parties in the Municipal Government and the Public Works Bureau that although the issuance of public bonds has been slightly postponed, according to reliable sources, they should be officially issued on the 17th. Since this matter has been passed through the legislative process, the official documents will definitely arrive in Shanghai within a few days, and the issuance on the 17th should not be a problem. At present, the Public Works Bureau and the Municipal Center Construction Committee have agreed with the construction factories that undertake the construction of urban buildings to start construction from the 17th and are actively preparing for the issuance. Considering the situation, there should be no further postponement.</p>
<h3>Groundbreaking Ceremony for the Great Stadium</h3>
<p>All of these public bonds will be used for various construction projects in the city. The designs for the Great Stadium, Library, and Museum have all been completed. Construction will begin in order after the public bonds are issued, with the stadium being the first to start construction. The various procedures have been agreed upon with the Chengtai Factory, which is undertaking the construction. When the stadium starts construction, Mayor Wu will personally preside over the groundbreaking ceremony. The tennis court, swimming pool, track and field, baseball field, and gymnasium attached to it will be held at the same time. The Library and Museum will also start construction one or two months later.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Submits to the Municipal Government – Requesting No Increase in Tobacco and Alcohol License Taxes</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted to the Municipal Government yesterday, stating: Regarding the matter of requesting: Upon investigation, the tobacco and alcohol license tax, which has now been transferred to local revenue, was originally intended to be used to allocate funds for the abolition of miscellaneous taxes. Since this city has no miscellaneous taxes to abolish, the allocation of this license tax to the city is an increase rather than an offset, which is different from other places. Therefore, the collection method should be as lenient and generous as possible to alleviate the difficulties of businesses. When this tax was handled by the central government, although it was later changed to quarterly collection, the amount of tax paid was moderately reduced according to the table, and there are precedents to follow. Since it has now been transferred to the city for handling, it is proposed that the old method be retained to avoid a sudden increase in the burden on merchants during this time of economic depression. It is appropriate to submit this request to your government for review and approval, and to order the Finance Bureau to approve and handle it as requested, which would be in the public interest.</p>
<h3>Progress of the Mongolian and Tibetan Academy</h3>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of the Mongolian and Tibetan Academy held its second preparatory meeting the day before yesterday at the New Asia Building on Sichuan Road. The chairman, Pan Gongzhan, reported on the progress of the project, stating briefly that the Panchen Lama had sent his representative in Beijing, Losang Jianzan, to Shanghai to assist in everything. The school buildings of the Academy are about to be completed, and in the autumn, a Mongolian and Tibetan language teacher training class will be opened first, with a quota of 40 students. After graduation, they will be sent to Mongolia and Tibet to teach Chinese and languages. To facilitate research, a Tibetan language specialization class will be added, with no limit to the number of students. Letters have been sent to the abbots of various temples, recommending monks to study at the Academy. It is heard that the representatives of the Zhangjia Master in Beijing, Mongolian Xi Zengge, and Gesang Yexi, the former Tibetan language professor at the Central Political School, have been hired as professors at the Academy. It is planned to recruit students in August of this year and start classes in September. The registration locations are at the Mongolian and Tibetan Academy on the east side of Longhua Temple in Shanghai and the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission in Nanjing.</p>

<h3>The Marine Engineers Association Strives – To Employ Chinese Personnel on Customs Patrol Boats – The Customs is Building Many New Patrol Boats – All Crew Members are Foreigners – Chinese People Strive to Recover Sovereignty</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs, in view of the increasing number of cases of tax evasion and smuggling of goods to various coastal areas for unloading recently, and the many batches that have been seized, in order to prevent tax evasion, the Customs has added a large number of patrol boats to be dispatched to various seaports and coasts to patrol for smuggling. The marine engineers on the completed patrol boats are all foreigners. The Marine Engineers Association of this port believes that this move by the Customs is contrary to the established practice and specially submitted a petition to the Inspector General of Customs and the Superintendent of Jianghai Customs yesterday, striving for the Customs patrol boats to employ Chinese marine engineers. The association requested that five of the newly built patrol boats be designated to be replaced with Chinese crew members for a trial period. The Marine Engineers Association will dispatch experienced and qualified personnel to fill the positions. The petition was delivered to the Customs in the afternoon yesterday.</p>

<h3>Zhabei Dayang Bridge – The Strike Wave Yesterday – Business Circles from Various Roads Petition for Punishment of the Culprits – Captain Bu Submits a Request for Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, regarding the strike case of merchants and residents in Lidi Port, Dayang Bridge, Zhabei, various party, government, police, and business agencies sent personnel twice yesterday morning to persuade them to resume business, but without result. Sun Guifang, the injured manager of the rice shop, was sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment. He is now staying at No. 120. It is reported that his ribs are broken and have injured his internal organs. His life seems to be salvageable, but it is difficult to expect a quick recovery. In the future, he may become disabled.</p>
<h3>Petition for Punishment of the Culprits</h3>
<p>The General Federation of Business Circles from Various Roads in North Shanghai held an emergency meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday. Ye Qichang, Gu Yunshuo, Xing Minyi, Ding Peisheng, Tang Jirong, Wang Yiheng, Cai Qiajun, Hu Yibo, Tong Mengkui, Yang Yicheng, and more than 20 others attended. The meeting was chaired by Hu Yibo. After discussion, it was decided that Wang Binyan and Cai Qiajun will be sent this morning, together with representatives from the Municipal People's Association, to visit Mayor Wu and the Director of the Security Bureau, Yang Hu, to petition for strict punishment of the perpetrators and to persuade them to resume business. (Also, regarding the incident of pouring water and injuring people on Haichang Road, the soldier's number was 1839, which was mistakenly printed as 1983 yesterday.)</p>
<h3>The Authorities' Stance</h3>
<p>After receiving the petition from the business community in the area, the Municipal Government ordered Yang Hu, the Director of the Security Bureau, to investigate the truth of the case strictly. If it is true, the offending soldiers should be severely punished. However, according to Director Yang, the cause of the strike in the area was due to the purchase of two dou of rice. But the Security Team never buys rice by the dou or sheng. There may be other reasons. If the soldiers commit violence without reason, they will be severely punished to maintain local security and protect business.</p>
<h3>Resubmit to the Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>The business shops at Dayang Bridge jointly submitted a letter to the Chamber of Commerce, stating: Respectfully, regarding the case of Huang Yuru, a partner of Hesheng Rice Shop at Dayang Bridge, being violently beaten by soldiers of the Security Team, and the manager, Sun Guifang, being injured, we have already sent a letter to your association for assistance. At this time of economic depression, the shops have already suffered from the decline in business and are struggling to support themselves, just to maintain the market and avoid the desolation of the market. Now, they have been subjected to wanton destruction, which cannot but make the residents in the shops feel frightened. If we do not fight for justice and allow them to be violent and do whatever they want, how can the merchants and residents have a day of peace? We hereby submit another letter to your association and the Municipal People's Association, requesting urgent consultation and submitting a petition to the Municipal Government and the Security Bureau to severely punish the responsible officers and soldiers, Captain Bu, and others, to appease public anger and warn others. This is in the public interest.</p>
<h3>Letter of Thanks for the Rescue</h3>
<p>Sun Guifang, the injured shop owner, sent a letter of thanks to the Fourth District Public Security Bureau, stating: Respectfully, I, Guifang, due to my misfortune, suffered a catastrophe in the January 28th Incident, losing everything. Although I have now resumed business, I am outwardly strong but inwardly weak, and it is difficult to maintain my business. Therefore, Captain Bu Wenbin of the Security Team stationed at the Yangzhou Public Office last year sent soldiers to buy rice on credit from my shop, owing a total of one shi and five dou. Later, he wanted to buy on credit again. Due to a lack of capital, I was unable to meet his request, and I was unable to gain Captain Bu's understanding, which I deeply regret. On the 9th of this month, the captain's soldiers came to cause trouble again under the pretext of buying rice, claiming that there was not enough rice. First, they beat my partner, Huang Yuru, and tied him up to the team. Then, more than a dozen soldiers came with Mori shells, disregarding right and wrong, broke into the shop, grabbed Guifang, and beat him arbitrarily. They even tied him up with ropes and dragged him to the team, beating him all the way, causing him to feel dizzy and almost unconscious, and almost suffered an accident. Fortunately, your chief heard the news and sent Chief Ouyang to drive to the team to rescue him. However, the car was also surrounded by soldiers, who shouted and beat, and poked with their bayonets, almost causing another tragedy. The Security Team, which is supposed to protect the area, is so violent and undisciplined, even more so than the defeated soldiers of the Taiping Rebellion. Guifang was rescued by Chief Ouyang at the risk of his own life, and he was able to escape. Although I am seriously injured, I still have a glimmer of life. If I can safely recover to normal, it will all be due to your chief's grace. I am deeply grateful and cannot express it in words. Lying in bed, I can only write a few words to express my gratitude first. If I can recover from my injuries and be discharged from the hospital, I will definitely visit you to express my gratitude.</p>
<h3>Request for Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, Bu Wenbin, Captain of the Second Company, First Battalion, Second Regiment of the Security Team, submitted a report to Mayor Wu and Director Yang, stating: Regarding the matter of reporting, I, last night, because Sergeant Qian Jihua sent soldiers to arrest a merchant privately without reporting to his superiors, submitted a clear report on the facts and requested punishment. Upon reading the newspapers of this port today (the 11th), all of them reported on the strike caused by the dispute between soldiers and civilians at Dayang Bridge in Zhabei. A comprehensive view of the facts is not entirely consistent with the truth. Therefore, I will explain the process of the case again, clearly. I beg you to review and verify it and quickly investigate it thoroughly, which would be my great fortune. Since my team moved in, all rice has been purchased with cash from nearby rice shops, and we have never bought on credit. Last year, because my family lived in Hexingfang, Dayang Bridge, I sent someone to Hesheng Rice Shop to buy five dou of rice and found that there was a shortage of twelve jin. I was planning to reason with the shop, but I had other things to attend to and did not go. The shop already knew that it was in the wrong and sent a shop assistant to my home to add rice. (Because the front door of my house is directly opposite the back door of the rice shop, it is very convenient to go back and forth.) After this incident, I mentioned it to Li, the platoon leader of the Dayang Bridge Security Corps. At that time, Yan, the captain of the Eighth Company of the First Regiment, was also present and can testify. The original report stated that I had harbored a grudge since last year because I was not allowed to buy rice on credit, and I had repeatedly sent soldiers to make trouble. I don't know what evidence there is. It is said that the soldier went to the nearby noodle shop to press noodles and asked him to weigh them on the way. According to him, there was a shortage of twelve liang. So the soldier went to the shop to reason with him. Unexpectedly, the shop poured the rice into the barrel and pushed the soldier out of the shop, returning the price of the rice. A group of people planned to beat him with bamboo poles. The soldier, being outnumbered, returned to the team to report to Qian Jihua, the duty platoon leader, and sent soldiers to arrest the shop assistant for questioning. On the way, Inspector Jiang of Tanziwan explained that there was a misunderstanding between the two parties, so he released him on bail. Later, Chen Zhiyue, the duty officer, learned about this matter and repeatedly investigated the facts. Now, the rice shop is inviting nearby shops to strike by force and is spreading false news in the newspapers, confusing right and wrong. I, as the captain, am not strict enough in supervising, and I am undoubtedly blameworthy. But for the sake of the reputation of the entire Security Team, I hereby submit a clear report on the process of the case again. I beg you to review and verify it and quickly send someone to investigate thoroughly to clarify the truth and maintain military honor. Respectfully submitted to Wu, the Mayor of Shanghai, and Yang, the Director of the Shanghai Security Bureau.</p>
<h3>Concealing the Types of Tobacco and Alcohol License Taxes – Must Be Investigated and Corrected</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, regarding the collection of tobacco and alcohol license taxes in this city, a person in charge of the Municipal Finance Bureau stated yesterday that the provisional regulations and implementing rules for tobacco and alcohol license taxes issued by the Ministry of Finance have been in effect for a long time. After this city takes over, it must follow the regulations of the Ministry. The regulations clearly stipulate which types of shops should obtain which types of licenses. If, in the past, some shops concealed the types of businesses in an attempt to reduce the tax amount (for example, a Grade A business reporting as a Grade B business to obtain a license), it must be investigated and corrected to ensure fairness. The principle of taxation should be based on fair burden. Failure to correct those who try to conceal and report falsely would not be fair. The types of businesses and license tax rates stipulated in the regulations issued by the Ministry are appropriate. This time, the central government resolutely transferred the collection of tobacco and alcohol license taxes to the local government, which is indeed a good intention to develop local businesses with local revenue. Both tobacco and alcohol are consumer goods. Those who operate consumer goods have already enjoyed special business rights and should fulfill their corresponding obligations to municipal facilities and pay taxes according to regulations. The various situations of the tobacco and alcohol industry reported in the newspapers the other day may be due to the fact that a small number of people in the industry do not understand their rights and obligations. The types and tax rates of tobacco and alcohol business licenses stipulated in the Ministry's regulations are as follows: (1) Tobacco business licenses are divided into wholesale and retail. Those who wholesale tobacco in bulk to retail merchants are wholesale businesses, divided into three levels: (A) Branches and distribution offices of cigarette manufacturers, 100 yuan per quarter; (B) Tobacco firms that wholesale, 40 yuan per quarter; (C) Shops that manage the wholesale of various types of tobacco, 20 yuan per quarter. Those who sell tobacco to retail consumers are retail businesses, divided into five levels: (A) Those who open shops to sell all types of tobacco, 12 yuan per quarter; (B) Other shops that mainly sell all types of tobacco, 8 yuan per quarter; (C) Other shops that also sell all types of tobacco, 4 yuan per quarter; (D) Those who set up stalls to sell tobacco, 2 yuan per quarter; (E) Peddlers who sell tobacco, 5 jiao per quarter. (2) Alcohol business licenses are divided into wholesale and retail. Those who wholesale alcohol in bulk to retail merchants are wholesale businesses, divided into three levels: (A) Those who wholesale more than 2,000 dan per year, 32 yuan per quarter; (B) Those who wholesale more than 1,000 dan per year, 24 yuan per quarter; (C) Those who wholesale less than 1,000 dan per year, 16 yuan per quarter. Those who sell alcohol to retail consumers are retail businesses, divided into four levels: (A) Those who open shops to sell all types of alcohol, 8 yuan per quarter; (B) Other shops that also sell all types of alcohol, 4 yuan per quarter; (C) Those who set up stalls to sell alcohol, 2 yuan per quarter; (D) Peddlers who sell alcohol, 5 jiao per quarter. (3) Foreign alcohol business licenses are divided into wholesale and retail. Wholesale businesses are divided into two levels: (A) Various mechanized wineries, importers, winery branches, and exclusive agents, etc., pay 50 yuan per quarter; (B) Various agencies and wholesale foreign alcohol shops, 10 yuan per quarter. Retail businesses are divided into two levels: (A) Various restaurants, hotels, and bars, etc., 10 yuan per quarter. Those who sell tobacco, alcohol, and foreign alcohol, or who sell both wholesale and retail, should obtain separate licenses and pay taxes according to the fixed amount.</p>
<h3>Taxpayer Association Urges the Municipal Council to Improve Public Bus Construction, Emphasizing the Principle of Ensuring Citizen Safety</h3>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession yesterday sent a letter to the Director-General of the Municipal Council, stating: "Regarding the matter, according to a letter from Mr. Tao Leqin, Secretary of this Association, on the 6th of this month at noon, his young son, Anren, was returning from shopping, riding a newly purchased bicycle, traveling east to west on Jing'an Temple Road, near the south sidewalk. When he reached the intersection of Chengdu Road, without hearing any horn from behind, he was suddenly knocked down by a public bus coming from behind, losing consciousness. His clothes were completely ruined. He was sent to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road for treatment by Chinese Constable No. 338. After being X-rayed, in addition to multiple abrasions on his face and left hand, the injuries to his left leg and left arm were the most severe, rendering him unable to move. He is currently receiving treatment in Ward 5, Second Class of the hospital. The rear wheel of his bicycle was completely destroyed, rendering it unusable. The force of the collision is evident. My son is currently a student, and although it is summer vacation, he still needs to undergo military training. Now, due to this collision, his studies have been disrupted, medical expenses have been incurred, the new bicycle has been destroyed, and his clothes have been damaged. The various losses and pain are self-evident. However, the incident involving my son is minor, while the safety of citizens concerning public buses is a major concern. As accidents involving public buses are frequently heard of, I, not being solely responsible for this matter, cannot specify the number, but a review of the newspapers would reveal alarming figures. Some say that public buses in the bustling city are not like trams, which have tracks to follow, and the drivers are mostly foreigners, resulting in reckless driving, treating human lives as child's play. If an accident occurs, they simply rely on their foreign shareholders and the power of those who hold municipal authority to cover it up, without any fear. Public buses have two major shortcomings: (1) The bus body is large, and the driver sits high up on the right side, allowing them to see far but not near, and they cannot see to the left. If a pedestrian is knocked down and drawn under the wheels, they may still be unaware. (2) Trams have iron fences and ropes in front, protruding forward, and a safety board under the engine. In the event of an accident, the iron fence provides a barrier, and the safety board protects the underside, preventing people from being drawn under the wheels. Public buses, on the other hand, have no protection. Once hit, there is no escape from becoming a ghost under the wheels. Moreover,</p>
<p>the tram tracks and the rebuilt trackless trolley lines are already established and difficult to change. These roads are already overcrowded with ordinary cars, horse-drawn carriages, rickshaws, trucks, small carts, and flatbed carts, causing great inconvenience to pedestrians. Public buses, regardless of the width of the road or the safety of pedestrians, without planning new routes for development, only seek to compete for business. They insist on operating where trams pass. The concession authorities, disregarding the safety of citizens, allow them to operate, which appears to be condoning. If this continues, I fear that accidents involving public buses will only increase. Therefore, I am specially writing to request that you inform the Municipal Council to not only prohibit public buses from running alongside existing tram lines but also order the public bus company to quickly improve their construction and add protective measures to ensure citizen safety. I am deeply grateful. As for ordering the public bus company to compensate the victims for damages and medical expenses, and guaranteeing that similar incidents will not occur in the future, this is the responsibility of the Municipal Council. I am very grateful for the assistance of Chinese Constable No. 338 in rescuing the victim. Accidents involving public buses are frequently reported in the newspapers. In the past, this Association has also received complaints from affected taxpayers, which have been forwarded. This time, Mr. Anren was knocked down by a public bus, injuring his arms and legs. His body has suffered pain, and his studies have been disrupted, which has had a significant impact. Upon investigating the cause, on the one hand, the construction of public buses is not yet perfect, and on the other hand, the drivers have not尽其審慎之能事尽其審慎之能事 not exercised their full discretion. I urge your office to review Mr. Tao's original letter, seriously consider the traffic problem based on the principle of ensuring citizen safety, and order the public bus company to quickly improve construction and provide careful service to avoid further negligent loss of life. As for this case, the bus company should bear the responsibility for compensating the victim for damages and medical expenses. I hope you will handle these matters separately and provide a reply."</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Customs to Revise Export Valuation of Cowhide</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a letter to the Jianghai Customs, stating: "Regarding the matter, on the 11th of this month, we received a letter from the Cow and Sheep Raw Hide Industry Association stating: 'Upon investigation, the customs has consistently valued raw cowhide, regardless of yellow cowhide or calfskin, at ten taels. With a 5% value-based tax, the export tax is five mace per hundred catties. Five or six years ago, the export sales of yellow cowhide increased sharply, and the market price soared, reaching over fifty taels of Shanghai silver per hundred catties. The customs valuation also increased from ten taels to forty-two taels. Previously, the export tax was five mace per hundred catties, but now it is two taels and one mace. When the customs increased the valuation, the industry association believed that the market price was indeed that high and should pay the increased tax to fulfill the obligations of a merchant and contribute to national tax revenue, so they remained silent. Unexpectedly, since the valuation increase, the export sales of cowhide have been sluggish, less than one-tenth compared to the past. The customs can compare this situation with the annual tax revenue. In recent years, the market price has also fallen from over fifty taels of Shanghai silver to around forty yuan of national currency, and it may continue to fall. However, the customs valuation remains the same. The industry is facing a dismal market and bearing excessive tariffs, making it precarious. The association believes that while the customs valuation of goods cannot increase or decrease with the market, it should not be permanently fixed. Previously, when the market price of cowhide rose sharply, the valuation also increased accordingly, which was reasonable. Now that the market price has fallen, the valuation should also decrease accordingly to be fair. Therefore, we earnestly request your association to forward a letter to the customs to change the valuation of yellow cowhide to forty yuan and the valuation of water buffalo hide to thirty yuan, so that our raw hide industry may be able to recover and revive the foreign market and save this sluggish market. This would be a great benefit.' Upon investigation, the current export tax rate for raw and processed leather products is 5% ad valorem. This valuation-based tax should increase or decrease with the market price. The market price of cowhide has been decreasing continuously, reportedly falling from over fifty taels of silver in the past to around</p>
<p>forty yuan of national currency, with a continuing downward trend. The situation is vastly different from five or six years ago. The association's request to change the valuation of yellow cowhide to forty yuan and the valuation of water buffalo hide to thirty yuan is a reasonable request. We hereby request your office to negotiate with the Tax Bureau and implement this change to promote public interest."</p>
<h3>Special Party Branch of the Municipal Security Bureau Holds Representative Assembly Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Special Party Branch of the Municipal Security Bureau held its first full-branch representative assembly. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. The assembly was held as scheduled yesterday, with 77 representatives, including Wen Yiru, and four preparatory committee members, including Yang Hu, in attendance. After performing the ceremonial rites, the chairman,</p>
<h3>Yang Hu, Delivered the Opening Address</h3>
<p>He briefly stated: "Representatives of the superior party committee, the presidium, fellow representatives, and distinguished guests, today is the day that the preparatory work of the Special Party Branch of this Bureau is completed, and we are holding our first full-branch representative assembly. The significance of the representative assembly lies in reviewing the effectiveness of past work and preparing plans for future work. Our country is currently in a precarious situation with internal and external troubles. The important task of saving the country from danger and revitalizing the national spirit naturally falls on our party. We must strive to strengthen our party's power to have a solution. On the other hand, every comrade must start from themselves, and then there will be hope. These are my simple contributions to everyone at the opening of this meeting, and I am willing to encourage everyone together. It's too hot today, so I won't say much more. Thank you." After the speech, the Secretary of the Special Party Branch, Lu Jie, reported on party affairs, and the Deputy Director of the Security Bureau, Zeng Zesheng, reported on bureau affairs. After the reports, Zeng Zesheng took over as chairman,</p>
<h3>Nominating Various Committees</h3>
<p>Presidium: Yang Hu, Zeng Zesheng, Ma Xiaoti, Lu Jie, Mi Xi. Proposal Review Committee: Wang Weiming, Wang Chu, Lou Zongyu, Hu Shaohan, Wang Xisan. Declaration Drafting Committee: Wen Yiru, Wu Chuanxin, Li Kairong, Sheng Jun, Fang Shan. Resolution Organizing Committee: Cheng Gongxia, Mei Xueyan, Shen Yulin.

<h3>Huang Zhongxiang, Delivered a Speech</h3>
<p>"Today is the day that the Special Party Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Security Bureau holds its first full-branch representative assembly. As a representative of the central government, I am participating in this grand event and am honored to meet with all comrades. Since the September 18th Incident, the Japanese imperialists have been insatiable, clinging to the aggressive policies of the Tanaka Cabinet, advancing an inch and taking a foot, disregarding the peace of East Asia, and directly causing the January 28th Shanghai War. The only international commercial port in the Far East was almost completely reduced to scorched earth. The national humiliation and national crisis are unprecedented today. After the ceasefire agreement, our loyal comrades took over this place. The comrades, mindful of the urgency of the national crisis, deeply felt that it would be impossible to succeed without collective efforts to implement the party's principles. The increase in the number of comrades in this Special Party Branch of the Security Bureau is proof of this. At the same time, it is also the result of the daily efforts of Director Yang Hu and the committee members in guiding and training. I would like to express my pleasure on behalf of the central government. We know that Shanghai is the economic and cultural center of China, the front line of national defense, and the main base for imperialists to invade our country. In Shanghai, imperialists can shoot and slaughter us anytime and anywhere. Therefore, the lives and safety of millions of citizens in Shanghai are not guaranteed. Comrades bear the heavy responsibility of defending the nation. We should uphold the Prime Minister's indomitable and fearless spirit, be the vanguard of our people, and be the defense force of the people. However, if we want to advance bravely and fearlessly, the only way is to fully accept the party's Three Principles of the People. The scars of January 28th seem to be healed today. The broken tiles and ruins of that time are no longer easy to see. But we cannot be satisfied or complacent with one-sided security and distorted development. The so-called metropolitan expansion under explosive conditions is caused by the bankruptcy of the rural economy. This is the most dangerous phenomenon. I hope that all comrades, under the leadership of the central government, will strive to carry out orders to achieve the responsibility of pacifying internal conflicts, resisting external aggression, and revitalizing the nation. Now, just in terms of party affairs, the preparatory committee has reached the stage of establishing the representative conference, which means that the party's organizational work has reached a legal stage. It is like countless pieces of scrap iron, which, after being manufactured by engineers, have become a complete and flexible machine. To put it bluntly, it has transformed from a disorganized mass of people into a solid and powerful group. But after the party's organization is perfected, has the party's work been completed? No, the party's work is only a part of the job. It is like scrap iron becoming a machine and a disorganized mass of people becoming a group. We cannot say that the machine and the group are the final goals. We must go further to use the machine and use the group to generate other effects, which is the purpose. Therefore, after the party's affairs reach organizational integrity, we must also use it. Therefore, the spiritual training of the party is the most important work in the future. In the past, when our party went on the Northern Expedition, the party army was only tens of thousands, and its materials were not as good as the enemy's. However, it was able to sweep away the warlords across the country in the shortest period and complete the unification. There was no other reason, that is, the party army not only had organization, but also had confidence and principles. We look to the past and the future, and the facts are clear. I hope we will devote ourselves to it. Furthermore, our Security Bureau's army has a close relationship with the citizens of Shanghai. In daily work, I hope to cooperate with the citizens in every way to achieve the Prime Minister's teaching that 'the army should cooperate with the people, and the army must be the armed force of the people.' If so, the social customs will be easily changed, because the army and the people will get along well, and the emotional barriers will naturally be reduced. Then, gradually influencing and transforming, we can achieve twice the result with half the effort. Since the May Fourth Movement, the youth's mood has been like a flood, excessive and unbounded, without end. The national character of our country formed by this movement is greed, numbness, laziness, and fraud. If this kind of bad national character is used in our country's current extraordinary period, it will inevitably fail. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek keenly understands this, so he specially promoted the New Life Movement to save our dying national character and to lay the foundation for the revitalization of the nation. I deeply hope that all comrades will truly understand the significance of the New Life and use it as our moral and character criterion. Then, practice it and extend it to society. If so, then we can seize the initiative and what is there to fear of imperialism? Finally, what I hope from all comrades, and what we must practice at all times, is, first, the training of military skills, and second, the enrichment of the military spirit. So that in the future, we can stand on the first line of the country's gates to crush the enemy's heads and seek the true liberation and revitalization of our nation. Now, I wish all comrades good health." After the speech, the election began.</p>
<h3>Election Results for Executive and Supervisory Committees</h3>
<p>Wu Huan, Zeng Zesheng, Lu Jie, Zou Yun, and Jia Botao were elected as executive committee members. Hou Dachun, Wen Yiru, and Wang Xisan were elected as alternate executive committee members. Yang Hu, Qi Xueqi, and Chen Zhuomin were elected as supervisory committee members. Chen Yigong was elected as an alternate supervisory committee member. It is reported that the total number of votes in the election was 81, and Mr. Yang Hu received 80 votes, which shows that Mr. Yang has the unanimous belief of the entire body. After the election, it was twelve o'clock, so they took a photo and rested. In the afternoon, the meeting continued, with Lu Jie of the presidium taking over as chairman.</p>
<h3>Discussion of Various Proposals</h3>
<p>The representatives proposed a total of thirty proposals, and the content of the proposals was quite brilliant. The weather was hot and humid, and the temperature inside the meeting hall reached 98 degrees, but the representatives were spirited and showed no fatigue. It was commendable that the entire process was discussed.</p>
<h3>The International Problems Research Association's Board of Directors Appointed Officers Yesterday</h3>
<p>The International Problems Research Association re-elected its fifteen directors for the third year. As a result, all the directors from the previous year were re-elected, as reported in the previous newspaper. Yesterday, the association held its first board meeting of the year, publicly electing its officers for the year. The results were the same as the previous year. The resolutions included: (1) Publicly electing Chen Guangfu as the chairman, Guo Bingwen as the executive director, Chen Liting as the research director, Zou Bingwen as the public relations director, Cao Yunxiang as the publishing director, and Xu Xinliu as the economic director. (2) The various organizations will jointly host a banquet for Minister to France Gu Shaochuan and Minister to Sweden Hu Shize. Guo Bingwen, Zou Bingwen, and Cao Yunxiang were specially appointed as the three directors to attend on behalf of the association. (3) Publicly appointed Huang Hanliang as an honorary director of the association and approved Li Bingrui and He Bingsong as members. (4) During the hot summer months, the association's research and lecture meetings will be temporarily suspended. (5) Abbreviated. In addition, there were many matters discussed, including a proposal to establish an international specialized research institution to assist foreigners who wish to study Chinese academics. Recently, many foreigners have come to China to study Chinese academics and various specialized issues, but they have difficulty starting due to language barriers and unfamiliar circumstances. This guidance mechanism is quite important. In the past, our country only sent students abroad to study Western civilization and did not pay attention to foreigners coming to China to study Chinese civilization, so that our culture had very few opportunities to be promoted abroad, resulting in foreigners despising our country, which is a great shortcoming. However, because this matter is of great importance, we want to conduct thorough research before we can obtain concrete measures.</p>

<h3>The Zhapu Seaside is As Quiet As Usual; the Government Is Turning Zhapu into a Military Zone Because It Is a Strategically Important Military Location; the Three-Day Deadline for Relocation Is Not a Ultimatum; |Everyone Obeys the Order to Relocate Except for Those in the Churches|</h3>
<p>The Continental Press reports that because Western newspapers in this city carried news that the authorities in Zhejiang Province were planning to use high-pressure tactics to seize the private property of foreigners in Zhapu, the Continental Press sent a representative to the area yesterday (the 11th) to inspect the truth. Upon arrival, everything was found to be as quiet as usual. The deadline set by the authorities for foreigners to relocate within three days expired yesterday. Almost all of those who came to escape the summer heat have left the area, with the exception of three priests from the Lazarist Church and thirteen friars from the Franciscan School of the Lazarist Church, who are still residing on the mountain. They are not opposed to the orders of the Chinese officials, but are awaiting instructions from senior church officials in Shanghai. The representative of the Continental Press also visited Mr. Antuning, director of the Franciscan School in Shanghai, and Mr. Morris, the agent of the Chinese Lazarist Church, who said that the French Consul General in Shanghai had begun negotiations with the Chinese authorities on this matter, so they are now waiting for the results of the French Consul General's negotiations to determine whether or not to relocate. The mountains of Zhapu overlook the bay and are strategically important military locations. Since the opening of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, it takes only two hours to travel by car from Shanghai, and many Chinese and foreign people come to visit the area because of its excellent scenery.</p>
<p>Many have purchased land and built houses, hotels, restaurants, cafes, and summer resorts in the mountains to attract tourists. A few months ago, a senior military official happened to visit the area and, seeing its strategic importance, suggested that the entire area be converted into a military zone. The proposal was adopted by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, who ordered the authorities in Zhejiang Province to implement the plan, so the authorities in Zhejiang Province issued an order prohibiting sightseeing and setting a deadline for relocation. The clergymen residing in the mountains have no objection to China's right to establish defenses within its own territory. As for the rumor that the Chinese authorities are planning to confiscate the properties of foreigners, this is probably because the local officials have not raised the issue of compensation for the relocated land, but according to Chinese officials in Zhapu, a solution will be found soon. Furthermore, the three-day deadline set by the Chinese officials was too hasty. For example, the Marist Church has been residing in Xiaoyuanshan for fifteen years, with many houses built and many utensils placed there. It is not possible to move all the utensils in three days. The Lazarist Church has also built houses on the top of Changshan and has many people living there, so it is not possible to relocate them in a few days. Some say that the Chinese officials are planning to confiscate the land of foreigners and resell it to others. This statement is unfounded. The Chinese authorities are now concerned with military affairs and do not want unauthorized people to reside in the area, regardless of whether they are Chinese or foreigners. The three-day deadline is not an "ultimatum," but only a request. It only stated that if they do not relocate on time, they will not receive police protection. The clergymen residing in the mountains have not been disturbed or evicted, and they are still allowed to re-enter the now-designated military zone in the coming weeks to arrange everything. Currently, in addition to ten police officers, there are no soldiers carrying large swords in the area. When the defensive works are completed in the future, they will be guarded by troops. At present, wooden fences have been built on the roads leading to the mountains to prohibit the passage of vehicles. In the past two days, trucks and other vehicles loaded with luggage, furniture, and other items have been traveling back and forth to Shanghai in an endless stream, as they are all relocating in compliance with the order.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Farmers' Association Held a Drought Prevention Movement Meeting Yesterday, Requesting the Municipal Government to Allocate 100,000 Yuan to Purchase Machines and Dredge Rivers, and Passed Various Proposals Such As the Outline for Drought Relief Loans for Farmers; |Representatives From Various Districts Will Petition the Municipal Government Meeting This Morning|</h3>
<p>The Municipal Farmers' Association convened a meeting of farmer representatives from various districts at 4:00 PM yesterday to discuss drought relief and disaster prevention measures, and passed proposals requesting the Municipal Government to allocate 100,000 yuan in advance to purchase water pumping machines to dredge agricultural rivers, and an outline for farmer loans. Farmer representatives from various districts are scheduled to petition the Municipal Government meeting at 9:00 AM this morning. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Representatives From Various Districts</h3>
<p>Pengpu District: Zhou Bulian, Hou Shizhang; Municipal Farmers' Association: Yu Zhenhui, Wusong District: Liu Beixing, Yin Dehua; Gaohang District: Qu Xing, Yang Jingyuan; Zhabei District: Zhang Fuxiang, Shen Wenbin, Tang Guanchun, Zhao Zuolin; Caojing District: Wu Ruzhang; Jiangwan District: Liu Daokui; Gaoqiao District: Lu Dong; Yinxiang District: Lu Jingtan; Huna District: Pan Rongting, Shen Ruoxu; Yangsi District: Ma Zhuangfu; Yinhang District: Zhu Wenxiang; Pusong District: Wu Baohua; Central People's Movement Guidance Committee: Fan Yuansheng; Municipal Party Department: Zhang Huijun; Social Bureau: Wang Shuji; Chairman: Yu Zhenhui; Recorder: Zheng Fengchu.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>The meeting officially began at 4:00 PM. After performing the ceremonial rites, Chairman Yu Zhenhui gave a report, stating briefly that since the beginning of summer this year, the weather has been arid and dry, and rain has been lacking, resulting in the withering of crops and severely impacting the autumn harvest. As the leading organization of farmers, the association has an unshirkable responsibility to provide relief to farmers. A drought relief and disaster prevention plan was previously submitted to the Municipal Government, but no concrete reply has been received to date. However, this matter concerns the farmers themselves, and farmer representatives from various districts should jointly plan and proceed, etc. Subsequently, representatives from the Central People's Movement Committee and the Social Bureau successively delivered speeches on drought relief measures, but the details are omitted.</p>
<h3>Resolutions Passed</h3>
<p>(1) Regarding the implementation measures for drought relief and disaster prevention in this city, which have been submitted by the Municipal Farmers' Association to the Municipal Government for approval but have not yet been approved, the question of whether to send representatives to petition the Municipal Government to expedite implementation: (Resolved) (A) Two representatives from each district shall gather at the North Railway Station at 9:00 AM tomorrow (i.e., this morning) to petition the Municipal Government. (B) Yu Zhenhui, Zhu Wenxiang, Hou Shizhang, Shen Wenbin, Shen Ruoxu, Liu Daokui, and Zhang Huijun are appointed as spokespersons. (C) The purpose of the petition: (1) To allocate funds of 100,000 yuan immediately to purchase water pumps and fuel for distribution to various districts for water lifting. (2) To request the Municipal Government to guarantee a loan of 100,000 yuan from the bank to regulate rural finance. (2) Regarding the issues of dredging rivers, digging artesian wells, and providing drinking water for citizens, to request the Municipal Government to order relevant departments to handle relief measures separately. (2) Regarding the proposal to request the Municipal Government to allocate funds to hire labor to dredge all agricultural canals in the city: (Resolved) Passed, to be implemented by the staff of the Municipal Farmers' Association. (3) Regarding the proposal to request the Municipal Government to raise funds to purchase rice for price stabilization to help the common people: (Resolved) Passed.</p>
<h3>Loan Guidelines</h3>
<p>(1) This summer, the weather has been severely dry, and rivers have dried up, making it impossible to irrigate farmland. As a result, various crops are withering. To prevent future problems, it is necessary to implement drought prevention measures in the hope of overcoming nature through human effort. However, the rural economy has been in severe decline in recent years, and drought prevention work depends heavily on financial resources. The regulation of finance must rely on the assistance of the government and banks to be effective. (2) The city has a total of seventeen districts. If each district has an average of about 40,000 mu (a Chinese unit of area) of farmland, the total farmland area in the city is about 680,000 mu. Rice paddies account for slightly less than 40%, cotton fields account for slightly more than 50%, and other crops account for 10%. Except for rice paddies already irrigated by farmers with water buffalo or water pumps (at a cost of four yuan per mu), the total area of cotton fields and other crops is about 400,000 mu. If farmers hire water pumps at a cost of one yuan per mu each time, the total cost of water lifting for the entire city would be at least 400,000 yuan, a truly alarming figure. Farmers with slightly better financial resources mostly hire water pumps themselves. Others are too poor to afford to hire pumps and can only watch their crops wither, feeling helpless. To provide relief, the government must divert water from large rivers to small rivers, and then farmers can lift water from the small rivers to irrigate farmland, so as to salvage the drought disaster in one out of ten thousand chances. In this case, the cost of water lifting for farmers in each district would still require at least 20,000 yuan, totaling more than 300,000 yuan for the entire city. (3) To achieve greater success with less expenditure and achieve twice the result with half the effort, it is necessary to rely on collective wisdom and effort to implement irrigation cooperation, which depends on the organization of cooperation. (4) The Municipal Farmers' Association should guide farmers in various districts to quickly establish rural cooperatives to handle irrigation cooperation and loan matters. (5) After the rural cooperatives in various districts are established, they should contact banks for loans. The soundness of their organization should be certified by the Bureau of Social Affairs. (6) After the rural cooperatives in various districts receive the loans, they must be responsible for repaying all the principal and interest by the end of the year without delay. Even in the event of special circumstances, they must repay at least two-thirds of the principal and interest of the total loan. (7) The interest rate for banks lending to cooperatives and cooperatives lending to farmers should be the lowest possible. (8) The Bureau of Social Affairs and the bank handling tax revenue should each send a representative to supervise and guide the rural cooperatives in various districts. (9) When farmers in various districts need loans for drought relief and disaster prevention or for insufficient agricultural capital, they may apply for loans from the rural cooperative in their district. (10) The amount of the loan for each farmer should be between five and twenty yuan. (11) When farmers apply for loans, they must fill out a loan application form. The loan must be guaranteed by a deed mortgage, a pre-pledge of agricultural products, a shop guarantee, or a guarantee by two or more people before a loan can be obtained. (12) After the rural cooperative in each district receives the farmer's loan application, it may release the loan only after sending personnel to investigate and verify the facts. (13) Farmers must repay all the principal and interest of the loan at the due date without delay. If there is any delay, the cooperative may recover the debt from the guarantor or sell the collateral to repay the debt. (14) The articles of association and detailed rules of the rural cooperative shall be formulated separately.</p>
<h3>Letter from the Municipal Party Headquarters</h3>
<p>The Municipal Party Headquarters yesterday sent a letter to the Municipal Government stating: "Respectfully, it has been found that since the beginning of summer, the city has experienced severe drought and rivers have dried up. In the countryside, the rice fields are cracked and parched, and crops are withering. The autumn harvest is hopeless, and a disaster is looming. If we do not plan for relief in advance, the national economy and people's livelihood will be greatly affected. We request that your government take swift measures to plan and prepare for prevention and maintenance in order to save the situation. We respectfully submit this letter and hope that it will be examined and processed with gratitude. Signed, Standing Committee Members Tong Xingbai, Wu Xingya, and Pan Gongzhan."</p>
<h3>Soft Drink Sales Surge Amidst Scorching Heat, Stamp Tax Revenue Exceeds 50,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>This year's weather has been extremely dry with no rain during the plum rain season. The heat has continued to increase, causing a surge in soft drink sales in the city. According to tax collectors, stamp tax revenue for soft drinks last summer totaled over 60,000 yuan, but in just one month before the summer season, over 50,000 yuan in soft drink stamp tax revenue has already been collected, indicating a significant increase in sales.</p>
<h3>Increased Water Demand Due to Scorching Weather, Water and Electricity Company Purchases Additional Water Pumps, Testing Results for Water Quality are Excellent, Giving Citizens Peace of Mind</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of summer, the weather has been scorching and rainless, and the demand for water by citizens has increased compared to the past. However, unclean water can cause many health problems. The Zhabei Water and Electricity Company has purchased two additional water pumps from the United States to test water quality and meet user demand, giving citizens peace of mind about their water supply. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Additional Water Pumps Purchased</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the scorching weather, the demand for water by citizens has suddenly increased. Previously, the daily water demand was around 8 million gallons, but since the beginning of summer, the daily demand has reached a high of 12 million gallons, an increase of more than one-third compared to before. If the weather continues to be scorching, the demand for water by citizens will inevitably increase again. The original two water pumps are difficult to supply enough water, so two new-style water pumps with a capacity of 1,600 horsepower have been purchased from the United States. The water pumping capacity is stronger than the original pumps. All the machinery has been installed and will be put into use soon. In the future, citizens will not have to worry about the demand for water.</p>
<h3>Water Quality Testing</h3>
<p>According to the company's latest water quality testing report, there is no E. coli present. The results of several tests have exceeded the water quality standards of the Health Bureau. Even drinking it cold is not a problem. The new addition of gas is 0.7%, which is the same as the method used by the New York Water Company in the United States. The results are very satisfactory.</p>
<h3>Construction of Substation</h3>
<p>The company recently completed the construction of two substations in the city center to supply water and electricity to the area. However, because the city is becoming increasingly prosperous, and the number of buildings is increasing day by day, the original power supply is insufficient. Therefore, it has purchased more than one mu (a Chinese unit of area) of land behind the new Municipal Government building to build another substation.</p>
<h3>Empty Hopes for Rain, Ministry of Industry and Commerce Cables for Drought Prevention, Bureau of Social Affairs Requests Municipal Government to Allocate Funds to Purchase Water Lifting Machines, Shallow Inland River Water Makes Navigation Difficult, Rice Prices Soar</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of summer, there has been no rain for a long time, and a drought disaster has already formed. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has telegraphed local governments to engage in drought prevention work and prepare relief measures. The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs has requested the Municipal Government to allocate funds to purchase water lifting machines. Although the main lines of inland river vessels are open, the branch lines have been suspended. Rice prices have soared. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce Cables for Drought Prevention, Minister of Industry and Commerce Chen Gongbo, in view of the scarce rainfall and hot, arid weather since the beginning of summer this year, the withering of rice paddies in rural fields, and the extreme impact on crop yields, telegraphed local governments the day before yesterday to quickly find ways to support farmers, engage in drought prevention work, and carefully plan relief measures as soon as possible. After receiving the telegram, the Shanghai Municipal Government immediately ordered the Bureau of Social Affairs to handle the matter.</p>
<h3>Request to Allocate Funds to Purchase Water Lifting Machines</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, in response to the fact that there has been no rain for a long time and a drought disaster is about to occur, and after receiving requests from the Municipal Farmers' Association and other groups to provide relief and prevent drought as soon as possible, in addition to sending personnel to various rural towns to inspect the disaster situation, has also requested the Municipal Government to allocate 5,000 yuan to purchase water lifting machines to provide relief to farmers and avoid the withering of rice paddies, resulting in a hopeless autumn harvest and affecting farmers' livelihoods. A decision has also been made on the method of purchasing water lifting machines, with ten machines per district and a time limit of one month.</p>
<h3>Soaring Rice Prices Affect People's Food</h3>
<p>The city's grain relies entirely on civilian ships from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to transport it to Shanghai. Now, because the rivers are shallow, there are few rice boats arriving in Shanghai. Rice merchants have held meetings to advise merchants from all provinces not to hoard and raise prices, and have sent personnel to contact them to transport rice to Shanghai. The average statistical rice prices in Shanghai are recorded below: In April, Grade 2 japonica rice was 6 yuan, 9 jiao, 4 fen, 3 li; indica rice was 6 yuan, 9 jiao, 8 fen, 8 li; glutinous rice was 7 yuan, 8 jiao, 7 fen, 8 li. In May, Grade 2 japonica rice was 7 yuan, 6 jiao, 5 fen, 3 li; indica rice was 7 yuan, 7 jiao; glutinous rice was 9 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, 6 li. In June, Grade 2 japonica rice was 8 yuan, 0 jiao, 9 fen, 2 li; indica rice was 8 yuan, 0 jiao, 7 fen, 9 li; glutinous rice was 9 yuan, 9 jiao, 7 fen, 2 li. As for the survey for the first period of July, Grade 2 japonica rice has already risen to 10 yuan, 0 jiao, 5 fen.</p>
<h3>Inland River Vessel Branch Lines Suspended</h3>
<p>A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency specially visited a member of the Shanghai Inland River Vessel Industry Association yesterday. According to him, the main lines of inland river vessels in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, such as Shanghai to Huzhou, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Songjiang, Pinghu, Haiyan, and Shanghai to Kunshan, Suzhou, Changshu, Changzhou, and Wuxi, have all changed to using smaller vessels due to the shallow river channels. The number of tugboats has also been reduced to avoid grounding in the middle of the voyage. However, branch lines such as Haining, Huzhou, Suzhou, and Wuxi have been forced to suspend operations due to the drought of the river channels.</p>
<h3>Factories Have Already Reduced Work Hours</h3>
<p>Due to the hot weather, the organizations in Shanghai affiliated with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and other organizations only work until 1:00 PM every day. The various organizations affiliated with the Municipal Government only advance their closing time by one hour, that is, until 4:00 PM. About thirty silk factories in the Hongkou, Zhabei, and Nanshi concession districts, both single and double-shift factories, have reduced their work hours to half a day due to the hot weather, which makes it easy for female workers to suffer from heatstroke, following the old practice of previous years. However, wages have also been cut in half. It is reported that many other factories have also reduced their working hours due to the hot weather.</p>
<h3>Charity Organizations to Set Up Altars Today to Pray for Rain, Altars to be Set Up at the Siming Guildhall on Minguo Road, Letter Sent to the Municipal Government Requesting a Prohibition on Slaughter</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Organizations United Association announced to all sectors to pray for rain, stating: "Since the beginning of summer, Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have been dry and rainless for a long time. The farmland is cracked, and the autumn harvest is hopeless. The climate is hot and oppressive, and epidemics are gradually increasing, with deaths increasing daily. At a time when the people are poor and resources are exhausted, if Jiangsu and Zhejiang suffer another disaster, the future is unimaginable. Our organization, together with the Buddhist Association, held a joint discussion at the Renji Shantang the day before yesterday, requesting the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and the Shanghai Municipal Government to seek rain and prohibit slaughter, and to issue a general order to all subordinate organizations to comply. Various charity organizations have also decided to hold prayers at the Siming Guildhall on Minguo Road from today until the 20th. Buddhist organizations will also sincerely pray at the same location. All the people of our two provinces should fast and abstain from meat during this prayer period. Those who live in this city should especially go to the Siming Guildhall to burn incense piously, in the hope of an early rainfall and to try to remedy the situation."</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Municipal Council Revises the Rickshaw Regulations, Drafts Regulations for Rickshaw Drivers' Licenses, and Establishes a Rickshaw Drivers' Mutual Aid Society</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council decided at its meeting on Wednesday, August 1, to implement the newly established public rickshaw (yellow rickshaw) license regulations. Regulations for public rickshaw drivers' licenses have also been drafted and will be announced soon. The main purpose of the newly established rickshaw regulations is to eliminate various long-standing malpractices, such as the illegal sale of licenses, the monopoly of license issuance by rickshaw guilds, and the unlimited increase in rickshaw rentals. The new regulations first state that the licensee must be the owner of the rickshaw. The Municipal Council will not recognize or tolerate the rental or sale of licenses and will actively crack down on them. In addition, the license is only valid for the current month, and whether or not it is renewed is entirely at the discretion of the Municipal Council. If there is any violation of the regulations, the license will be suspended or revoked, all or part of the deposit will be forfeited, and the owner will be prosecuted. All licensees must affix a prescribed fare table to the right side panel of the rickshaw. The table will be issued by the Council, and the fare is set at one jiao and a half per mile, with one jiao being the minimum price. The fare is also six jiao per hour, with six jiao being the minimum. If the passenger and the rickshaw driver agree on the fare in advance, this rule does not apply. The style and standards of the rickshaw must be approved by the Municipal Council. The raincloth must be complete, and two lamps must be provided, white in the front and red in the back, which must be lit at dusk. The rickshaw must be inspected by the police. It must not carry two adult passengers, and it must not carry dirty items or items that may damage the rickshaw or obstruct traffic. People with infectious diseases and their clothes and bedding must also not be carried. After the implementation of the rickshaw driver's license, the Municipal Council will announce a date after which rickshaw owners must not rent rickshaws to unlicensed drivers. The owner must provide the driver with a uniform and raincoat and keep them clean and complete. The rickshaw must not be rented to a sick driver, and the police must be notified if the driver is sick. The owner must provide the driver with a copy of the rickshaw regulations and any revised articles and explain everything to him so that he can follow them. The rickshaw rental fee charged by the owner must not exceed the maximum amount prescribed by the Municipal Council from time to time and must not be determined by others. The owner must keep a record of who rented the rickshaw each day and the actual rental fee collected. The police may inspect the record.</p>

Any changes will be announced later.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Ferry is Building a Double-Decker Pier at the Bund on Beijing Road, A First for Shanghai, to be Completed in December</h3>
<p>Since its establishment in October of last year, the Shanghai Industrial Trust Company has actively progressed in various businesses. Recently, the Municipal Ferry Management Office of the company, in view of the Tongren Pier on the Bund of Nanjing Road being the central point of various long and short routes, and the frequent trips of the Municipal Ferries to and from that location, considered that the original location was insufficient for expansion, and that passengers waiting for the ferry were exposed to the elements, suffering greatly from the cold and heat, which was not conducive to maintaining passenger safety. After repeated planning by Tan Boying, the manager of the company, an agreement was reached with the Municipal Council to construct a steel double-decker special floating pier and two floating bridges at the Bund on Beijing Road, close to the Tongren Pier. After five months of design, the complete drawings were completed and publicly tendered. The bid was opened on the 30th of last month, and the company's managing directors decided to award the contract to He Xing Shipyard for 70,022 yuan, 6 jiao, and 7 fen. The contract has been signed and construction has begun, with completion expected in December of this year. It is understood that this double-decker pier is the first of its kind in Shanghai and also rare in the Far East. It is divided into two levels. The lower level is the waiting room for ordinary passengers, and the upper level is the waiting room and office for first-class passengers. There is a dedicated telephone system to centrally direct each route. The waiting area has many seats and tea-drinking utensils to quench the thirst of thousands of passengers. It is expected that after completion, passengers will be spared the suffering of wind, frost, rain, and snow, as well as the worry of crowding.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Municipal Council Prepares to Implement Price Stabilization Measures</h3>

<h3>Chen Baoming, Who Was Kidnapped, Safely Escaped and Returned Home, His Guard Fell Asleep from Exhaustion, The Hostage Took the Opportunity to Escape</h3>
<p>Chen Baoming, 16 years old, son of the late Tu Dong Chen Fengxiang of Nanshi Dock in Pudong, was kidnapped by four bandits at around 10 p.m. on the 10th when he walked out of the old house, intending to return to the new house. The old servant Hang Geng, who was traveling with Baoming at the time, was released by the bandits midway. The situation was recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Unexpectedly, the hostage suddenly returned home safely at around 9 p.m. the night before. According to what his family members told the police station in the third district and third precinct, when Baoming was taken away by the bandits, he traveled south along Pudong Avenue to the shore of Bailianjing Port. The four bandits swam across the water with the hostage to the other side. In the darkness, they went straight south for about twenty or thirty li and arrived at a white-walled house. They took the hostage into the room and treated him quite well. At that time, there was another old woman and three children in the room. The four bandits then forced Baoming to write a letter to his family, preparing funds for ransom. Three bandits took the letter and went out together, claiming to go to the general headquarters in Puxi. One bandit, the original woman who was watching the house, and the three children were left to guard the hostage. Soon, the woman and children went to sleep first, and the guarding bandit also gradually fell asleep from exhaustion. Seeing that the opportunity had arrived, the hostage pretended to want to urinate, but the bandit did not respond in his sleep. The hostage boldly took a pistol from the table and opened the three door bolts inside and outside before he could escape. He abandoned the pistol and followed the original road back. After walking for several li, he suddenly arrived at a town. After careful examination, he realized that it was Mitang Town. At this point, the hostage knew the way and had a relative in the town, so he went to knock on the door to seek refuge and lodging. He still dared not go out all day on the previous day until the evening, when he sneaked back home, and so on. Inspector Dai of the police station immediately telegraphed the third district and third precinct. Director Dong reported to the Public Security Bureau because the location of the hostage was in the territory of Nanhui County, so that the bandit den could be searched.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Yan Luqing Ordered to Suspend His Duties</h3>
<p>The robbery case at the office of English accountant Xue Mai Luo at 9 Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, which caused a sensation for a time, involved Zhang Zuming, Zhuang Yuanda, Zhuang Jimeng, the little boss of the Ruichangshun Hardware Store, and Ren Lianyou, and Tang Qingyue, the director of Dade Hospital. The Second Special Court has completed the final trial and declared the defendants not guilty. The details have been recorded in previous newspapers. However, at the time of the incident, lawyer Yan Luqing, together with his colleague Zhou Jinggeng, extorted 62,000 yuan of lost property from the families of the various defendants. It is now learned that the deliberation committee of the Lawyer Disciplinary Committee of the Third Branch of the Shanghai Jiangsu Higher Court passed a resolution stating that, according to Article 16, Paragraph 1 of the Rules of the Lawyer Disciplinary Committee, lawyer Yan Luqing should be suspended from his duties first. It is heard that the court has ordered the bailiff to notify lawyer Yan to implement the suspension.</p>

<h3>Is Ye Jiaxing a Member of the Military? The Ministry of Military Affairs Has No Record of Him, The Court Does Not Recognize Him as a Soldier</h3>
<p>Ye Jiaxing, a member of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, participated in the Xu Yuying's lawsuit against Ji Juemi for adultery. After the court's judgment, the Xu Case Support Association issued a declaration attacking the First Special District Local Court and accused the judge who tried the Ji Xu case to the Ministry of Justice. The Prosecutor's Office of the First Special Court investigated and found that the committee members of the Xu Case Support Association were suspected of insulting the public and filed a public prosecution according to law, requesting that the committee members be punished for obstructing official duties. When the trial opened, the defendant Ye Jiaxing hired a lawyer to appear in court, stating that Ye was serving as an adjutant in the 26th Division, was a member of the military, and was not subject to the jurisdiction of ordinary courts. The presiding judge Zhan Liangce then instructed to examine Ye Jiaxing's part and question him again after clarification. The remaining defendants continued the trial and concluded with fines, which has been determined for a long time and there is no problem. As for the question of whether Ye Jiaxing is a soldier, the First Special Court had previously submitted a request to the Ministry of Judicial Administration to forward it to the Ministry of Military Affairs for investigation. The Ministry of Justice has now instructed the court that, according to the reply from the Ministry of Military Affairs, the commander of the 26th Division has not submitted a request to appoint Ye Jiaxing as the adjutant of the division, which proves that Ye's military status is still difficult to determine. Since he is not a soldier, the First Special District Local Court naturally has the power to accept the case. Therefore, Judge Zhan opened the court for interrogation yesterday afternoon, and Prosecutor Zhong Qing attended the court to perform his duties. However, the defendant Ye Jiaxing still did not arrive. Two lawyers representing him appeared in court, claiming that Ye Jiaxing was serving as an adjutant in the 26th Division, and that the officers and soldiers of the division were now suppressing bandits in Yangxin, Hubei Province, and Ye was also working at the headquarters. According to the Army and Navy Regulations, he has actually obtained military qualifications and should be instructed that the case is not accepted, etc. Prosecutor Zhong then stood up and stated that as for the question of Ye Jiaxing's identity, why did Ye never mention that he was the adjutant of the division when the case was being investigated? It was only after he was prosecuted that he presented the letter of appointment from the 26th Division, which is quite suspicious. Recently, it has been repeatedly found in newspapers that the defendant has participated in various meetings in the city, which shows that his so-called soldier is nothing more than a word of excuse. Judge Zhan, because the defendant's lawyer said that Ye Jiaxing was working at the division headquarters in Yangxin, then asked if he could present concrete evidence to prove it. The lawyer then requested the court to investigate the Ministry of Military Affairs again and requested that a ruling be made on Ye's identity issue first. Judge Zhan then based on the instructions of the Ministry of Justice, that Ye had not only not been appointed by the Ministry of Military Affairs, but also that the commander of the 26th Division had not had the procedures to guarantee Ye as the adjutant, so he cannot be regarded as an active soldier. There is no need to discuss the issue of whether he is a member of the military. The defendant's lawyer was instructed and ordered to withdraw and wait for a scheduled hearing.</p>
<h3>Scorching Heat Fire and Record</h3>
<p>▲ Qiwu Pu Road</p>
<p>From No. 946 to No. 956, Qiwu Pu Road, Yangshupu, is the Jinhua Silk Weaving Factory with five storefronts. It is large in scale and employs over a hundred workers. Its silk fabrics are quite popular in society. Yesterday morning, around 2:20, the factory suddenly caught fire for unknown reasons. Immediately, smoke and flames shot out in all directions. Adding to the ferocity was the scorching sun, making it impossible to approach the fire. Although the fire brigade rushed to the scene with vehicles to put out the fire, it was ineffective. As a result, the factory was almost completely destroyed. It is said that the losses were enormous.</p>

<p>▲ The Trademark Dispute over "One Drop Fragrance" Has Been Resolved</p>
<p>Since its release in January last year, the "One Drop Fragrance" perfume produced by the Sino-Western Pharmacy on Fourth Road has sold very well. To prevent counterfeiting, the pharmacy specifically used names such as "Drop Drop Fragrance" and "Love Fragrance" as joint trademarks. Unexpectedly, an industrial company in this city also applied to register the three characters "Love Fragrance" as a perfume trademark. Subsequently, the Sino-Western Pharmacy filed an objection with the Trademark Bureau. The industrial company then hired accountant Pan Xulun to present a defense. Now, the Trademark Bureau has ruled that the trademark "Love Fragrance" belongs to Sino-Western Pharmacy, etc.</p>
<p>▲ Good News for Domestic Goods Factories</p>
<p>Since the bankruptcy of rural areas and the decline of the social economy in our country, although the prices of all commodities have plummeted, there is still a situation of oversupply. As a result, factories are the first to suffer. Recently, Mr. Miao Dawen, manager of Jingyi Industrial Co., Ltd., in view of this, specially gathered funds to establish the Dafu Sales Company on the fifth floor of the XinKaiHe Flour Exchange, dedicated to promoting products from various domestic goods factories throughout China and the South Seas Islands. The internal scale is grand, and the capital is sufficient. Branch offices have been established in various ports to expand sales. It is reported that more than 20 companies, including China Brothers Chemical Industry Co., Anfeng Enamel Factory, Jingye Industrial Co., Gongming Electric Appliance Factory, Hua Mao Company, Zhenyu National Goods Machine-Made Toothbrush Factory, Tongchang Thermos Factory, Puqiu Industrial Company, Qunfu Industrial Factory, Lingsheng Ink Factory, and Lifeng Ink Factory, have entrusted them with sales or management.</p>

<p>Reading and Questioning to Explain Practice</p>
<p>|| Answering Luo Shudu, Zhu Qitong, and Fang Bingru</p>
<p>"What is practice?" Mr. Luo posed this question to us. He continued, "Some say that practice is the standard of truth. If this statement is correct, wouldn't different practices produce different truths? Japan considers Manchuria its lifeline, which is Japan's truth, determined by Japan's practice. From China's standpoint, the opposite is true. The conclusion derived from China's practice should be recovering lost territories, which can be considered the truth. In this case, wouldn't the standard of truth become even more uncertain?" At the same time, Mr. Zhu and Ms. Fang, after reading the "Reading and Questioning Collection, First Volume," were still not very clear about the explanation of the word "practice." Therefore, we still need to explain it further.</p>
<p>We often remind readers that they must prove the truth through practice, taking practice as the basis of cognitive movement and as the standard of truth. If it were as Mr. Luo said above, it would undoubtedly mislead people into the wrong path of pragmatism. Mr. Luo's doubt shows how much he has been influenced by the poison of pragmatism. Pragmatism's understanding of practice is vulgar. "Seize this moment!" is their slogan. They only see the immediate, practical things that benefit them. For example, the view of practice held by Japanese financial and military cliques regarding Manchuria belongs to this category. This kind of practice view is egoistic.</p>
<p>This kind of blind utilitarianism results in surrendering to the current reality and bowing down before an authority. Individuals easily become like petty merchants, only knowing how to seek small profits and losing sight of the greater and more distant goals.</p>
<p>Vulgar views of practice are all metaphysical. In their eyes, they only see individual facts and not the overall development, not seeing the contradictions in reality. It is a superficial method of observation. (To be continued)</p>
<p>The Drifting Records of Spring and Autumn Incense</p>
<p>Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty</p>
<p>Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>At his feet, he also wore a pair of black satin boots like those of the ministers. I often imagined that if a person like him were to wear a complete set of military uniform, he would definitely look extremely heroic.</p>
<p>Although in reality, he was already a deposed emperor, and he spent all year round as if sitting in a city of sorrow, the cumbersome formalities in the palace still wouldn't let him go. The Empress Dowager's intention was simply to force him to be a complete puppet! For example, even eating was a matter of torture. At every meal, he had to enjoy those more than one hundred meaningless dishes, and all one hundred dishes were the same as what the Empress Dowager ate, regardless of his taste, and they could never be changed; because his dishes were cooked together with the Empress Dowager's, he naturally couldn't make decisions or choose what he wanted! What was particularly embarrassing was that he had to eat and drink alone, coldly and quietly, at every meal. His wives, Empress Longyu and Consort Jin, had to serve and wait in the Empress Dowager's car. After the Empress Dowager finished her meal, they would go up together with us and eat the Empress Dowager's leftovers. Therefore, it was rare for them to have the opportunity to dine with Emperor Guangxu! However, the Empress Dowager was still very indifferent to this daughter-in-law, Longyu, who had to serve at every meal! On average, she wouldn't say a word to her in a month, and her eyes were always as if she had never seen her. Perhaps in the Empress Dowager's brain cells, there was no shadow of this empress at all!</p>
<p>Poor Emperor Guangxu, his situation was even more painful than that of an ordinary commoner. Sometimes, he could only reluctantly do some more interesting things to amuse himself, squeezing out a smile from his tearful eyes. But he was truly extremely afraid of the Empress Dowager, and he had to be careful at all times not to do anything that would displease her in the slightest. (82)</p>
<p>What Souvenirs Do We Have?</p>
<p>Yan Qiao</p>
<p>A Dr. Zhao who studies chemistry went to Japan to visit factories. A few days ago, he wrote a letter to his friend saying: Attached to the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo is a "Yushukan," which displays ancient and modern Japanese weapons, swords, spears, and halberds, as well as submarines. Trophies from the Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War, and the Battle of Liuhuo near Zhabei the year before last are also on display. The strangest thing is a glass cabinet that specially displays Ma Zhanshan's belongings, including epaulettes, certificates, seals, and silver yuan banknotes, as well as a bundle of opium pipes, about five or six, all inlaid with ivory or jade, and a large package of top-quality opium, which can be said to be the ultimate in humiliation, making people both cry and laugh. Another cabinet is dedicated to the items of the 19th Route Army, including telescopes, machine guns, straw hats, and the banners of the Liuhuo militia, which also evoke many emotions.</p>
<p>Judging from the thoughts in the belly of the shorty, he must be exaggerating the military might of the imperial army to those who come to visit. We thought that the Battle of Shanghai was a defeat for the Japanese, but they exaggerated it as a victory. We have also obtained the belongings left behind by Japanese soldiers. Where are they now? Why don't we display them for us to see? Is this the only way to show the demeanor of a great power?</p>
<p>The effectiveness of education is several times greater with real objects than with empty words. Instead of spending a lot of money to have foreign painters smear a few national humiliation paintings that are not very lifelike, why not collect the real objects that caused the national humiliation and display them in one place, so that the people of the country will be shocked and alarmed when they see them. It seems that an exhibition was held in various places a few months after the end of the war. Where have they been put now? Alas! In short, the Chinese National Army, having obtained the enemy's belongings, does not dare to openly display the word "trophy" and does not dare to display them as permanent souvenirs. Is this one of the long-term resistance strategies? Or is it a gesture of co-prosperity and friendship?</p>
<p>Northeast Fourth Company Commander</p>
<p>Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 31</p>
<p>Three Encounters, White-Clad Soldiers Charge Through the Snow Formation</p>
<p>The Entire Battalion Sacrifices, Red-Eyed Soldiers Enter the Gun Forest</p>
<p>He shouted the commands: "Attention! Fix bayonets, turn forward, charge towards the West Gate, run!" As soon as he said the word "run," he had already sprinted ahead of more than a hundred men. When he reached the West Gate, he saw a tank and two or three hundred infantrymen approaching this way outside the fort at the gorge of the destroyed fort. Defending the gap was a platoon of battered brothers from Yin Deren's company. Seeing the enemy advancing like a tide with machine guns and small cannons on the tank, how could they hold this gap? Thinking of seeking survival in death, he could only rush forward to intercept the tank. Therefore, he kept running forward. Zhao Ziqiang shouted "Kill! Kill!" and also charged up behind Bao Fang.</p>
<p>As long as they were alive, the Chinese soldiers in this fort had now charged to the front line. There was only one person who had not charged to the front line, and that was Company Commander Yin Deren. Because his arm was injured the night before and had not healed, he could not exert any force. But although he could not fight, he was not willing to sit in the house. He followed the team hiding under the battlements of the fort, watching the enemy's movements. At this time, it was clear from the fort that the bullets the enemy was firing at this side, without even hearing the earth-shattering sound, just by looking at the smoke rising in the sunlight, one could know how powerful they were. Battalion Commander Bao's intention to lead all his brothers to charge over in such a serious situation was admirable for his courage. But in terms of numbers, the enemy was more numerous and we were fewer. How could they break through? Yin Deren held onto the battlements with one hand, watching intently. He saw that Chinese soldiers had already reached the front of the enemy's line, but their infantry did not advance. Only the machine guns sticking out of the tank were sweeping the Chinese soldiers. Yin Deren suddenly stood up and shouted, "Republic of China!" and jumped down the fort. (433)</p>
<p>Interesting Talk in the Wind</p>
<p>Mei Xue</p>
<p>I have often heard the saying, "Pray for rain and get wind, ban slaughter and get scallions." The first half has now come true. The gentlemen in Suzhou invited the Bronze Guanyin from Guangfu and prayed for rain for days, but they got a series of southeast winds. The red sun is in the sky, with no clouds at all. Could it be that Guanyin hasn't arrived, but Feng Jia's eighteenth aunt has? However, "the red sun burns like fire," and with these gusts of heat-relieving wind, even without rain, it is quite pleasant. The following are many interesting stories, talking about heaven and earth in the wind, using this to while away the time and send off the setting sun, to welcome the plain moon.</p>
<p>When I was in school, I was used to showing off my little cleverness. Now, on summer vacation at home, I am lucky not to have joined military training. Holding a palm-leaf fan and wearing slippers, I have not forgotten my old habits and have started acting like a mad slave again. I happened to think of two characters, which only need to turn a somersault to have completely different meanings and stand in opposite positions. Can you imagine what these two characters are? Someone asked me to give a few examples of what "turning a somersault" means. I said, "Turning a somersault means reading the original text backward. For example, 结交 (jié jiāo, to make friends) turning a somersault is 交结 (jiāo jié, to associate), 合欢 (hé huān, marital harmony) turning a somersault is 欢合 (huān hé, happy union). But this is not surprising, only because 结交 and 交结, 合欢 and 欢合 have similar meanings and are not in opposite positions. The two characters I am talking about have absolutely different meanings when read forward and backward. When read forward, they are suitable for hot weather. When read backward, they are suitable for severe winter. When read forward, they are the proper life of a modern youth in summer. When read backward, they are the proper supplies of an outdated old man in severe cold. I have explained everything. Everyone should be able to guess it." But everyone could not guess, so I had to reveal it. Everyone listened and clapped their hands together. It turned out that the text was the two characters 兜风 (dōu fēng, to go for a drive). Turning a somersault, it became 御寒的风兜 (yù hán de fēng dōu, a wind hood for keeping out the cold), also known as 风帽 (fēng mào, a hood). 兜风 is suitable for hot weather, and 风兜 is suitable for severe winter. 兜风 is the proper life of a modern youth in summer, and 风兜 is the proper supplies of an outdated old man in severe cold. Isn't this standing in opposite positions?</p>
<p>An old gentleman, seeing me showing off my cleverness, also came to tease me. He said, "Young man, do you know that the mountain shape of Xiangshan County is very similar to an elephant? I have a couplet. Can you match it? 象山山象象 (Xiàngshān shān xiàng xiàng, Elephant Mountain's mountain is like an elephant), what do you match it with?" This made it difficult for me, difficult in the two characters 象象, the first is a verb, and the second is a noun. After thinking for a long time, the savior Bodhisattva arrived. Who is the Bodhisattva? It is the brave soldier who galloped past "May 30th Road." I said, "I have it, it can be matched with 骑士士骑骑 (qíshì shì qí qí, A knight's knight rides a horse). The two characters 骑骑, the first is a verb, and the second is a noun." The old gentleman nodded slightly and said, "Unfortunately, the character 骑 used as a noun is not a level tone." I said, "Then please, senior, match another one." The old gentleman did not make a sound, just looked at the setting sun on the willow branches, and secretly walked over there.</p>
<p>Can Earthworms Sing?</p>
<p>Huang Baihong</p>
<p>The other day, I read a small knowledge column that said, "Animals Predict Weather," which stated that if earthworms sing, it is a sign of sunny weather.</p>
<p>According to the records, the earthworm, also known as the curved earthworm, has a body as thin as a rope. It has absolutely no sound-producing parts on its body. The popular legend that earthworms can sing is just a traditional misunderstanding of scholars using their ears instead of their eyes. In reality, something else is singing, and it is definitely not the earthworm.</p>
<p>So what exactly is singing? Haha, it turns out to be the mole cricket.</p>
<p>Because mole crickets often live near earthworms, mole crickets are shaped like locusts and can jump and fly, while earthworms crawl. By the time we follow the sound, the mole cricket has already flown away, leaving only the earthworm, so everyone has this misunderstanding.</p>
<p>A Brief History of International News</p>
<p>Shanghai News Agency</p>
<p>"The World in Your Home" is written on the Shanghai Times billboard at the intersection of Shanzhong Road and Route Haig. Yes, when we open the international section of the newspaper every day, aren't the world's news from the day before gathered at home? In modern times, communication tools are fully utilized, and spreading news is really easy. Recently, international wireless telephone has also been connected to Shanghai. No matter where an accident occurs, it can be reported immediately. However, we also think of the era of difficult transportation many years ago. What is the story of those international news agencies that bear the burden of collecting and disseminating news overcoming many obstacles and developing? The following will describe the history of Reuters' activities in this city and the anecdotes of communication between Shanghai and abroad.</p>
<p>The first international news agency to operate in Shanghai was the British Reuters. The headquarters of the agency was founded in 1858, and its activities in East China began in 1871, when it established an agency in Shanghai. At this time, only the Zi Lin Daily used its news releases, and the agency's purpose was to collect news from all parts of China and supply it to the headquarters. At that time, submarine cables had not yet reached Wusong, and there were no landlines installed in China. In March 1871, Reuters issued a notice stating that it intended to receive news from all parts of China, first by mail to Singapore, and then by telegraph to London. The notice also mentioned that Mr. Grant had made many great contributions, namely collecting news in Shanghai, sending it by sea to Tianjin, and then sending it through the long and dangerous land route from Tianjin to the Great Northern Telegraph Bureau in Hakhtu, Siberia, before relaying it to Europe by telegraph. In this way, compared to passing through the Suez Canal via the monthly Europe-Asia voyage, it could reduce several days. This spirit of hard work is obviously admirable.</p>
<p>In 1883, the British Great Eastern Telegraph Company's submarine cable was extended to Wusong and obtained landing rights. Thus, according to the following route, Shanghai could directly communicate with Europe:</p>
<p>Wusong to Chuanshi Mountain | Chuanshi Mountain to Hong Kong | Hong Kong via Guam and Singapore to Europe.</p>
<p>From then on, European telegraphic communications could be received in Shanghai on the same day, or at the latest, the day after. Reuters used its exclusive rights to the British submarine cable to maintain the authority of international communications in Shanghai for a long time, until it encountered the strong rival of French wireless telegraphy at the end of the European War. (Although the German Great German Telegraph competed with it, its capabilities were weak.)</p>
<p>The French Capital Wireless Telegraph Company established a wireless radio station in Gujiazhai (the intersection of Fuli Road and Albert Road) in the French Concession of Shanghai. In 1918, it transferred the telecommunications expert Borolman from Guangzhou Bay to Shanghai to preside over the station. Mr. Bo improved the motor and increased the power of receiving electricity. Thus, the station was able to receive telegraphs from more than 6,000 miles away. When Mr. Bo's arrangement was just completed, he received a telegram from General Fexing, commander of the American army in France, to the Washington government. Later, Mr. Bo and Paris agreed that Lyon would transmit electricity to Shanghai every day. The time of transmission was 10:00 PM in Europe and 6:00 AM in Shanghai. Therefore, war news often reached Shanghai before it was published in Europe, so people in Shanghai were able to read war reports at the same time as Europeans. Soon, the armistice message came from the wireless radio, and how happy were the Chinese and foreign merchants who had been troubled by the war for a long time.</p>
<p>During the European War, Reuters telegrams took about three or four days to reach Shanghai, which was naturally not as good as French wireless radio. However, at that time, the French news agency did not use the Shanghai radio station to compete with Reuters, but only used the received telegrams as official reports and sent them to various newspapers. Recently, the French Havas News Agency has been releasing articles in this city, and the Gujiazhai radio station has been fully utilized.</p>

<p>To Mr. Chen Shicheng:</p>
<p>I have been researching the question of where the "Yanling Fishing Platform" is located, and Mr. is full of enthusiasm. I said that Yanling Mountain is Fuchun Mountain, but Mr. opposes it. Opposing it but still not being able to confirm where Fuchun Mountain is, where is Fuchun Mountain; the further away from the center of the problem, the farther it goes. It is appropriate for "Spring and Autumn" to refuse to publish our articles. However, I like to explore the truth in academic research, and if Mr. is interested, please choose a day to come to my place for a close chat? Address: Library of the Flour Exchange, Minguo Road.</p>

<p>Business News Finance　Spot Goods Arrive in a Flood Daily　Gold Price Falls Again by Four Yuan and Nine Jiao　|Bearish Momentum Increases|　　Yesterday, the gold market saw silver prices rebound from a low; although the situation was stable mid-way, the banks' extraordinarily eager appetite to sell caused a flood of spot goods to arrive, and short sellers became active. The situation was difficult to sustain throughout the day. In the early morning, overseas silver markets saw both British and American prices rise, with forward silver prices on the Metals Exchange rising by anywhere from 1% to 4.5%. Exchange rates fell slightly, London raw gold fell by 1.5 pence, stocks rose slightly, American cotton rose by 33 points per pound, and American wheat surged by 5 cents. News reports stated that the US government is currently issuing $10 million in silver certificates each month. The Treasury Department estimates that in addition to existing silver, it will need to purchase an additional 217,983,300 ounces to meet the legal requirement of a 75/25 gold-silver reserve ratio. The Treasury Department can freely issue silver certificates at a rate of 271.25 grains per dollar under the Silver Act. This news dampened sentiment, and preliminary trading opened and then fell back to 45 yuan. However, as the May silver price closed up a small amount, buyers were emboldened to buy on the dip, and the price rose. Sentiment was good after the opening, and the market was quite stable. A speculator named Wu purchased some, anticipating that the HSBC listing would not move and would pull the price up. However, due to the banks' continued aggressive selling, the gold market was oversupplied and gradually declined slightly, but still struggled, with a very narrow range. Later, as the domestic market gradually loosened and the banks' willingness to sell did not diminish, the trend finally weakened. The overnight silver price from Seattle was reported at up 125, down 125, unchanged, and down 125, which only slightly raised the price. The midday close was still weak. Later in the day, the overnight silver price from Seattle rose 125, 125 unchanged, and rose 125. The market was already weak at the opening. Banks continued to sell, and the exchange market loosened slightly. Telegrams from Bombay reported rises of 5, 5, and 6 annas, and the gold price finally succumbed. However, sentiment remained stable, and Guangdong merchants and others made slight purchases on the dip, which was able to maintain the price somewhat. Telegrams from Bombay reported rises of 1, 1, and 1 anna, which had little impact. The price of pure gold was calculated at 994 yuan and 2 jiao. The day's market situation is recorded below.　　The morning opening was 985 yuan and 7 jiao, down 3 yuan and 4 jiao from the previous close. The item opened at 5 yuan and 7 jiao. The exchange market opened with recent asking prices. British exchange was 1 shilling, 4 pence, and 25, and US exchange was 34 yuan and 125. It then became 5 yuan and 6 jiao.

Yiqingyong, Dadecheng, Hengyu, Yuanmaoyong, etc., sold, and the price fell to 5 yuan and 8 jiao. After learning that the HSBC listing was unchanged, both British and American prices were flat. Yifengyong, Dafayong, and Hengyu made purchases. Huixiang bought most aggressively, and the price rose to 7 yuan and 5 jiao.

Citibank and Huabi offered US dollars for October delivery at 4375. Yiyu, Yuanmaoyong, Dadecheng, and others sold at high prices, and the price fell to 6 yuan and 5 jiao. Hengyu and Yongli still bought, once pulling the price up by 9 jiao. Mitsui then sold US dollars for September delivery at 3125. Hengyu sold out, and the price fell. Banks traded against each other in US dollars for September delivery at 375, offering US dollars for October delivery at 4375. Shendayong, Zhaofengchang, Futaiheng, and others sold out one after another. The stable situation was finally broken, and the price fell to 6 yuan and 4 jiao. Yingfengheng and Fuxingyong still bought on the dip, and the price rose again to 7 yuan and 2 jiao. Huabi and Datong offered US dollars for August delivery at 25. Futaiheng sold again, and the price fell to 6 yuan and 2 jiao. The overnight silver price rose and fell, but declines were slightly more numerous. Hengyu still bought, and the situation remained stable. However, HSBC, Huabi, and Magali all sold US dollars for September delivery at 375. Fuyu, Hengtai, Yicheng, and others gradually sold out and retreated to 6 yuan. However, those making purchases were quite eager, and Shunli's willingness to buy was particularly strong, which allowed the price to be pulled up. The midday close was 986 yuan and 2 jiao, and items were traded at the same price.　　The afternoon opening was 985 yuan and 9 jiao, and items opened at 6 yuan, due to the overnight silver price rising again by 125. Magali, Mitsui, and Meifeng offered US dollars for September delivery at 375. Dalian merchants, Wanxing, Shunli, and Hengyu sold, and the price fell to 4 yuan and 6 jiao.

Dadecheng and Hengxing bought further, rising to 4 yuan and 6 jiao. Bombay rose another anna. Yongli sold, retreating to within 4 yuan. Huixiang, Yuqingyong, and Shunmao still had a buying appetite on the dip, and the price was pulled up again. After fluctuating, the close was 984 yuan and 2 jiao, and items were traded at 4 yuan and 3 jiao. After the close, Huixiang and Fuxingyong bought, and the price rose. Hengxingyuan bought even more, reaching 5 yuan. Wanxing's selling slowed the rise somewhat. The highest price during the day was 987 yuan and 5 jiao, and the lowest price was 983 yuan and 6 jiao, a fluctuation of 3 yuan and 9 jiao. The result was a decline of 4 yuan and 9 jiao from the previous close.　　The settlement price was based on HSBC's US dollar listing, which remained unchanged at 33 yuan and 625, equivalent to a gold price of 1029 yuan. In terms of the closing price, the squeeze was approximately 45 yuan weak, an increase of about 5 yuan from the previous close. The book price for August delivery was 986 yuan, the morning margin call was 985 yuan, and the afternoon margin call was 983 yuan. The pure gold price was 994 yuan and 6 jiao. Trading in the market was more active. Tianjin merchants sold approximately 4,000 taels to Yingfengheng, with an additional 10 yuan. In addition, eastern goods were sold with an additional 9 yuan, and spot goods continued to flood in, leading to a more stable short-selling mentality. The spread between forward and spot prices was estimated at around 5 yuan for buyers.　　In the market, sellers became more active. In summary, Yifengyong, Hengyu, Huixiang, Yongli, Qingfayong, Shunmao, Xianghe, Fuxingyong, Shenkang, Hengxing, Changshengyong, Yimao, Dingtai, and Hongxing, Tongtaichang, etc., were on the buying side.

Compared to the previous close, British and American each loosened 0.0625. After opening, it loosened immediately, and the banks' appetite to sell poured out. However, because the gold merchants' appetite was quite strong, the HSBC listing was announced, and British and American prices remained unchanged, and were even slightly tighter. However, the banks' appetite to sell continued to pour out.　　Later, it gradually loosened again. Overnight silver prices reported both rises and falls, which also had little impact. Later in the day, the overnight silver price rose again by 125. Bombay rose by 5 annas. Banks' willingness to sell continued, and the process loosened slightly.

The Cause and Effect of the Silver and Money Business Being Quiet Spring Harvest Poor, Market Entry Scarce Both Commercial and Rural Markets are Equally Miserable　　　According to past practice, mid-summer is the time when the rural spring harvest is in season. General grain merchants go to the countryside to purchase goods, and there is a large influx of goods, requiring a great deal of money. However, this year, the opposite is true. Agricultural production has been poor, merchants have been unable to travel, and the need for funds has had no outlet. In addition, the market is sluggish, and the silver and money industry is unwilling to easily lend money, turning a great opportunity for prosperity into a pipe dream. In the end, the market is no different from foreign market splits. Both morning and afternoon markets opened at 5 points as usual. There was no added water at the beginning and the market remained plain. Early market transfer and new exchange transactions totaled over 2.9 million, with just over 200,000 in the afternoon market. Transactions in the small general association totaled over 300,000. Foreign pledge transactions redeemed 700,000, with new transactions of over 900,000. Bank receipts and remittances were also weak with no progress. Foreign banks received and remitted over 1.3 million in notes and funds, and received and remitted over 2.3 million in various goods, exchange, and pledges, with 400,000 in warehouse withdrawals. Chinese banks received and remitted over 3.7 million in notes and funds, and received and remitted over 3.0 million in various goods, exchange, and pledges, with over 400,000 in customs duties and 300,000 in warehouse entries. Japanese banks received and remitted over 1.5 million in notes and funds, and received and remitted over 2.1 million in various goods, exchange, and pledges, with 300,000 in warehouse entries. Private banks received over 33 million in foreign public bills and remitted over 280,000 in foreign funds. Exchange funds from various routes totaled over 400,000, with over 20,000 in cash remittances. Paper money received plus over 300,000, and issued over 800,000. There was no source of customers and no outlet.　　Also, the total number of exchanges in this city's clearing house was 7.58973377 yuan, including 3.74515896 yuan in silver dollars, 3.54457481 yuan in exchange transfers, and subsidiary currency remained consistently strong.　　Yesterday, in the Jiangnan small foreign exchange market, the morning market traded at 835 yuan and 8 jiao, up 3 jiao from the previous day. The afternoon market was the same, with transactions made. 7,000 jiao in the morning market and 2,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small foreign exchange opened in the morning market at 728 yuan and 5 jiao, slightly better by 2 jiao from the previous day. The afternoon market closed up another 7 jiao, changing to 719 yuan and 2 jiao. The result was an increase of 9 jiao from the previous day, with transactions made. 55,000 jiao in the morning market and 35,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins also increased by 1,500 cash, to 334,000 cash, with the transaction price of foreign exchange being 12,000 yuan, totaling 40,080 strings of cash. Securities　　Public Debt Buying Interest Revives Various Prices Gradually Rise Transactions Reach 20 Million　　　Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange's market recovered to prosperity. Major firms bought strongly, and although short sellers sold off, it was not as active as before. The 96-type advanced slowly, with a tendency to rise. After the crash and trading halt, long positions gradually shifted from retail investors to powerful figures. The price increases in recent days have been due to their margin calls. Yesterday morning, all varieties opened slightly lower, continuing the previous day's decline. By the time of the disarmament futures, buying interest suddenly surged, and the situation changed suddenly. Prices gradually rose, and the 46-type absorbed a large quantity, and the upward trend became stronger and stronger. By the 22nd, the interest rate of 6 increased sharply by over one yuan, and the buying interest in 96 was boiling, rising sharply by one yuan and three jiao. Futures rose by only seven jiao and a half due to a slight increase in sellers. The secondary market opened for trading after one o'clock, and the market atmosphere was slightly depressed at first due to the inverted 96 market price. All bonds mostly retreated by three to five jiao. The 4th number bought in large quantities after the issue of the 20 roll, and finally the 32nd issue failed to weaken and did not revive first. But when the gold short 4th number aggressively raised prices again, the market price progressed from 76 yuan and 5 jiao to 77 yuan, and popularity was instantly excited. The market price rebounded firmly by several jiao. Because the previous rise of 96 was relatively large, it was slightly tired, but the situation was extremely firm. As a result of the full-day market price, most of them rebounded by several jiao to over one yuan. The total transaction volume was about 20 million yuan. The following is a comparative table of highs, lows, rises, and falls (unit: yuan).　　Type　Spot　　Highest　　　　Lowest　　　　Compared to Previous Day 18 Customs　　　July　　29.90　29.60　Rise 0.2518 Customs　　　August　　·····　·····　······Compilation of　Wills　　　July　　44.35　43.81　Fall 0.10Compilation of　Wills　　　August　　43.95　43.21　Rise 0.15Disarmament　and Arrest　　　July　　80.40　79.70　Fall 0.05Disarmament　of Soldiers　　　August　　79.40　78.70　Rise 0.2519 Customs　　　July　　46.50　46.00　Rise 0.5019 Customs　　　August　　46.75　45.10　Rise 0.7019 Charity　　　July　　52.50　52.30　Rise 0.4019 Charity　　　August　　51.60　51.40　Rise 0.4020　Roll　　　July　　56.10　56.00　Rise 0.9520　Roll　　　August　　55.60　54.80　Rise 0.3020　Customs　　　July　　57.60　56.50　Rise 0.3020　Customs　　　August　　56.60　56.00　Fall 0.05　20　Customs　　　July　　60.50　60.05　Rise 0.2020　Unified　　　August　　60.05　59.45　Rise 0.1520　Salt　　　July　　61.70　61.20　Rise 0.3520　Salt　　　August　　61.30　60.80　Rise 0.50Gold　Short　　　July　　77.10　76.4　　Rise 1.00Gold　Short　　　August　　77.75　77.45　Rise 1.10Account　Disaster　　　July　　76.50　·····　Fall 1.1022 Customs　　　July　　68.90　66.60　Rise 1.2022 Customs　　　August　　66.55　68.20　Rise 1.2523 Customs　　　July　　78.60　77.10　Rise 2.2023 Customs　　　August　　77.20　76.3　　Fall 0.20Integer　Six　　　July　　72.40　71.80　Rise 1.60Integer　Six　　　August　　72.65　72.35　Rise 1.10Nine　Six　　　July　　16.95　16.40　Rise 0.90Nine　Six　　　August　　17.10　16.55　Rise　0.55Gold　Long　　　July　　53.25　52.80　Fall 0.10Gold　Long　　　August　　53.40　53.10　Rise 0.30New York Commodities Soar　　　Xinfeng Foreign Firm Reports: Yesterday (11th) New York stock market, due to soaring commodities, market conditions were still firm. However, (wet) stocks showed weakness due to the government's lifting of restrictions on alcohol imports. Commodities, led by wheat, rose strongly. The government's wheat harvest estimate was so dire that it shocked people. Sentiment rose to the extreme, and wheat prices soared by 5 cents (maximum limit). Although bulls cashed in at high prices, market conditions remained unmoved. Thereafter, sellers disappeared, and the situation turned dull. The small exchange was also firm. The bond market trended higher under the leadership of US government bonds. Banks had a strong appetite, so several types of treasury bonds broke high records again. However, German bonds rallied. The full-day transaction volume was 650,000 shares (securities), further demonstrating its firm footing, and it seems set to continue higher. (Grains) The market rose due to accumulated unfilled purchase orders. Regarding wheat and corn, future prices will still depend on the severity of supply and demand. (Cotton) Market conditions were strong, and spot merchants bought actively. External demand also increased. According to this week's cotton crop report, the western regions are suffering from drought and conditions are poor. It is said that the government has no intention of selling cotton this year. There were few sales in the south and few sales elsewhere. The spot market was sluggish, and the foothold was firm. (Rubber) Market conditions were stable. Dealers had some demand, and supply was scarce. The Dow Jones Index is listed below.　　July 10th　　July 11th　　　Rise/Fall30 Industrial Stocks　　98.07　98.67　Rise 0.6020 Railroad Stocks　　44.18　44.19　Rise 0.0120 Utility Stocks　　23.79　23.72　Fall 0.0740 Bonds　　　94.94　95.09　Rise 0.1511 Commodities　　　56.47　58.34　Rise 1.87Yarn and Cotton　Yarn Market Benefits from US Cotton　Yunnan and Guangdong Spot Sales Revive　More Bullish Sentiment　Japanese Firms Still Sell on Rises　Rise Inevitably Slows　　The yarn market remains flat. Due to the continued rise in foreign cotton, sentiment is good, leading speculators to buy. Spot yarn sales are more active in the southern ports. Other trading ports remain inactive. Due to the hot weather, many yarn factory workers are reducing their hours, resulting in more bullish sentiment. However, Japanese firms sell on rises, with large short positions, so the market is under pressure, and the upward momentum is not strong.　　Golden Rooster Trading Firm Continues to Buy　At the opening of the bid yarn market, with US cotton up 30 points per pound, many predicted a two-yuan increase before the opening. However, after the opening, although major firms bought in the market, the situation remained flat and weak, rising only one yuan. By the second and third rounds of bidding, the market softened again. According to popular opinion, due to the drought and poor harvest, rural economies will suffer, and future purchasing power will be weak, so retail investors are still unwilling to go long. As a result, each month rose by five, six, seven, and eight jiao, with a total of 29,600 bales traded. The following were sold: Dafu 500 bales, Mei Ji 600 bales, Tongji 500 bales, Hengyi 550 bales, Dafeng 1,850 bales, Jinchang 1,600 bales, Huikang 1,700 bales, Tongxing 750 bales, and Hengchang 1,250 bales.

US Cotton Rises for Three Consecutive Days　Fresh Cotton Rises Sharply　　The cotton market is trending firmer and rising sharply due to US cotton rising for three consecutive days, a total of 90 points per pound, leading speculators to go long. The focus is on fresh cotton. Recently, continuous heat and prolonged drought may damage cotton plant development, so buying is particularly strong. However, bull companies are cashing in on double profits, and prices are slightly loosening.　　(Zheng Standard Rises Three to Four Jiao)　At the opening of the bid cotton market, the rise was still strong. Due to the volatility of US cotton prices, bulls were eager to see higher prices, and more continued to buy. Fresh cotton rose sharply. However, the situation for old cotton was looser due to bull companies selling out. As a result, the current month was unchanged, and distant months rose by two, three, and four jiao, with a total of 158,500 dan traded. The following were sold: Shenchang 9,000 dan, Changhe 3,000 dan, Yifeng 10,000 dan, 7,700 dan, Changfeng 9,000 dan, Yangcheng 3,800 dan, Hengde 3,200 dan, and Huikang 3,600 dan.

<h3>Liang Sisters' Dance Girl Case: Dispute Over Age Arises; According to Sai Zhen, She Has Not Reached Legal Age; Lawyers on Both Sides Have FierCE Debate on This Point</h3>
<p>Li Hongyuan, manager of the Da Hu dance hall, filed a lawsuit with the First Special Court's Civil Division against the three Liang sisters, Sai Zhen, Sai Zhu, and Sai Shan, for violating their contracts, seeking damages of more than 14,000 yuan. The content of the lawsuit has already been reported in this newspaper. This case was heard yesterday morning by Judge Luo Chongtai in Civil Chamber Seven. Many members of the gentry and ladies came to the court to listen, admiring the Liang sisters' beauty and talent, so the courtroom was full and there was almost no space. The plaintiff's lawyers, Jiang Yiping and Wu Peng, and the defendants' lawyers, Wu Kaisheng, Ni Jiong, and Cai Xiaobai, all reported for duty. The three Liang sisters, all wearing bamboo-colored short-sleeved cheongsams and white leather shoes, arrived at the court in a car with their father, Liang Qiuming, at around 9 o'clock. They first rested in a room downstairs. At around 10 o'clock, the case was opened. First, Li Hongyuan, the manager of the plaintiff Da Hu Dance Hall, stated the circumstances of the Liang sisters violating their contracts, and his agent, lawyer Wu Peng, supplemented the statement, saying that there were some changes to the requested damages. The claim for compensation from Liang Sai Zhen was calculated at 6,312.8 yuan, Liang Sai Zhu at 3,835.91 yuan, and Liang Sai Shan at 4,306.61 yuan. It was found that the three Liang sisters, Sai Zhen, etc., had all signed formal contracts as dance girls at Da Hu. Sai Zhen's contract was from January 1st to the end of the year, a total of one year. Sai Zhu and Sai Shan's contracts were from December 1st of last year to the end of November of this year. Article 2 of the contract stated that if a dance girl, without reason, breaks the contract and leaves arbitrarily, hindering the business of the hall, the dance girl should return all the dance fees and allowances earned during the contract period, and must compensate for the losses. The dance girl should not make excuses or shirk responsibility. He then submitted the contract as evidence. However, according to the treatment of ordinary dance girls, all outstanding dance fees, in addition to being divided with the dance hall, would also have 15% of the total monthly amount deducted as an allowance. However, because Liang Sai Zhen refused to receive the same treatment as ordinary dance girls and requested an increase, she received an extra allowance of 5 yuan, making it 20%, and two Western meals per day, costing 1 yuan. Now, Liang Sai Zhen and the other two suddenly left on June 15th of this year without reason, and the contract had not yet expired. Therefore, according to the provisions of Article 2 of the contract, all losses should be claimed and fully compensated. Then, Liang Sai Zhen testified that she was 21 years old, born in the year of the Tiger, in December. She was a dance girl at Da Hu and did not sign a contract, only signed her name. The term was indeed one year. The dance fees earned were all taken home as family living expenses, but she did not understand the contents of the contract. After Judge Luo's calculation, Liang Sai Zhen was not yet 20 years old and should have her father as her legal representative to participate in the lawsuit. He then questioned Sai Zhu, who claimed to be 18 years old, from Guangdong, living at 8 Qinyuan Village, Xin Zha Road. She was a dance girl at Da Hu, only knew how to sign her name, and did not sign a contract. Liang Sai Shan testified that she was 17 years old and the rest of her testimony was the same as Sai Zhu's. Then, Liang Qiuming testified that he was 60 years old. The three girls, Sai Zhen, etc., were all his biological daughters. He knew that they danced at Da Hu, but he did not know about signing contracts at all. The dance fees earned were all handed over to him for expenses on a monthly basis. Judge Luo ruled that the three Liang sisters were all minors and this case should have Liang Qiuming as the legal representative, but the plaintiff's lawyer, Jiang Yiping, stood up and objected, saying that the Liang father and daughters had colluded to come to court today to reduce their ages, so that the signed contract would not be effective. Therefore, regarding the age issue, they could not rely on their one-sided statements and had to provide considerable evidence to prove it. Therefore, there was a major dispute regarding Sai Zhen's age. Lawyer Jiang also presented two pieces of evidence: one was an advertisement published by the defendant's lawyer on behalf of the defendant, and the other was a letter from the defendant's lawyer to the plaintiff, stating that the letter stated that he represented the three Liang sisters, and there was no mention of a legal representative, which shows that Sai Zhen was indeed an adult. If the defendant believes that she was not an adult, then they must be responsible for proving it. Moreover, Sai Zhen had previously represented her two younger sisters in signing contracts with Da Hu three times as a legal representative. Finally, Judge Luo asked Liang Qiuming about the ages at which he gave birth to the three daughters, Liang Sai Zhen, etc. Qiuming initially answered that he gave birth to Sai Zhen at 40 years old, Sai Zhu at 43 years old, and Sai Shan at 45 years old. Then, he suddenly changed it to 44 years old for Sai Shan. At this point, the lawyers on both sides stood up to argue one after another. For a time, there was a heated exchange of words, with neither side giving way. The atmosphere in the courtroom suddenly became lively. Later, Judge Luo issued an order prohibiting further speeches, as there were too many people speaking and it was impossible to adopt anything. He also stated that this case still required an adjournment to investigate the age issue, and then announced that the hearing would be rescheduled to the afternoon of the 24th of this month. Both parties then withdrew.</p>
<h3>Female Doctor Lin Huizhen is Accused: Xu Dongsheng Accuses Her of Negligence Causing Death; Lin Submits Three Medical Books for Self-Defense</h3>
<p>Xu Dongsheng, a native of Haiyan residing at 23 Bode Lane, Tongfu Road, recently hired lawyer Zhang Shizhao and filed a criminal self-accusation with the First Special Court against female doctor Lin Huizhen, a native of Fujian, and Dai Xianyu, manager of the Liji Pharmacy on Lloyd Road, for negligence of duty causing death. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Zehan presided over the hearing in Criminal Chamber Three. The defendants also hired three lawyers, Jiang Yiping, Shen Yuesheng, and Jiang Rong, to defend them. According to the self-accuser Xu Dongsheng, his wife, Ms. Sheng, had suffered from renal tuberculosis for four years. Starting in November of last year, she suddenly felt unwell and suffered from abdominal pain. On December 5th, he hired the defendant Lin Huizhen to treat her. On the night of the 9th, she took two pills of silver nitrate opium pills prescribed by Dr. Lin. To his surprise, the next morning she felt different and vomited yellow water, lost her appetite, and vomited frequently with severe abdominal pain. He then asked Dr. Lin to come again and again to diagnose and treat her, but there was no improvement and the illness became more serious. He urgently hired two other doctors, Wang Qizhang and Yu Yunxiu, who both said that the illness was critical. She died at 10 pm on the 13th. Upon investigation, his wife's condition was not serious before. After taking the silver nitrate opium pills, the illness worsened and she could not be saved. He was not familiar with medicine. After discussing it with the medical community, he learned that silver nitrate is made from nitric acid, and its toxicity is known. Opium pills have a numbing effect and also belong to toxic agents. It is dangerous to take silver nitrate internally, and the prescription prescribed by Dr. Lin did not specify the dosage. The Liji Pharmacy did not consider this when receiving this prescription without the dosage specified and rashly prepared it, causing the patient to mistakenly take it and not recover. By the time it was stopped, it was too late. This was negligence of duty and a trivial matter of human life and should be punished according to the law. Lin Huizhen testified that she had been treating the plaintiff's wife's illness. The silver nitrate opium pills taken this time were not harmful to the patient. According to Western medical books, it can be taken internally. She then submitted three medical books to prove it. When questioned, Dai Xianyu said that the pharmacy had the doctor's draft of the drug and could not arbitrarily dispense it. Finally, the self-accuser applied to withdraw the portion against Dai Xianyu, which Judge Wu approved. He also announced that the case would be adjourned for seven days for further hearing.</p>

<h3>Hu Mingchun, the King of Hanzhuang: Attempts to Cancel the Inspection of Prostitutes; Exposed and Reported by French Policeman; Business Licenses of Both Zhuang are Revoked</h3>
<p>Hu Mingchun, a well-known owner of Hanzhuang in the French Concession, runs two large-scale brothels in the French Concession at 58 Gui'an Lane, Glock Road, and 114 Ailai Green Road. Almost all customers visiting the brothels know of Hu. A former French policeman, No. 117 of the French Police, had been friends with Hu during his tenure. Recently, most of the Hanzhuang owners in the French Concession, in view of the strictness of the police's inspection of prostitutes' bodies, jointly discussed with Hu to request the cancellation of the inspection measures. At that time, Hu thought of the French policeman No. 117, who had served in the police and was a Frenchman, so he immediately agreed with the policeman. Two weeks ago, the policeman came forward and planned to host the current head of the flower tax class of the French Police at the Lafayette Garden. The head of the police did not care at first, but when policeman No. 117 explained his intentions, the head of the police realized that they had ulterior motives and was greatly angered. After further investigation, he learned that it was Hu's doing. The next day, he summoned Hu to the police station for investigation. Hu denied it. The head of the police then searched 58 Gui'an Lane and arrested Hu's wife, Ms. Hu Fang, on the spot, and sent her to the Second Special District Court for prosecution. She was soon sentenced to four months in prison. Unexpectedly, the police have now found that Ms. Fang is not Hu's wife, but a maid in Hu's house, impersonating her. The police again dispatched detectives to 58 Gui'an Lane the day before yesterday, revoked the license for the business, and continued the investigation.</p>
