<p>國内之情况旣如是則欲直接繁榮城市或使工業向上發逹或使商業立卽重興皆屬渺無把握之事縱有若干政治上與經濟上之特殊力量可激使城市繼續繁榮强勉支持現狀然而究非長久之局且更不能抵搞列國之傾銷政策以故治標之術惟有自農村經濟之週轉入手今日農村之所渴望民間之所急需者無他首在秩序之確實安定捐稅之相對減輕誠能如是則以我國農民耐苦茹辛之本能或不難以自已之力圖更生之道不過幾經喪亂之餘加以國難時期之延長僅祗安定秩序究尚限於消極方面殊未足以收恢復城市繁榮之效是以最低限度更應使農村經濟週轉靈活農民皆有餘資以培殖其生産然後對城市工業出品方有購買能力國民經濟前途始有復蘇希望其法維何卽實行倡導農村信用合作是已</p>
<p>現時所行之農村貸欵其貸出旣不普遍手續又多煩複實際上之效果僅限於局部而於整個農村困難問題依然如故欲求農村貸欵之普及使其經濟週轉活潑莫如由省政府監督各縣舉辦農村入用合作社其資本由縣政府籌劃三分之一或二分之一餘由中央向上海天津等大都市金融界通融或發行公債以爲信用合作社之流動資金其貨出之制限不必太嚴祗須有相當確實保證卽可償還期限務宜稍長—最短亦須八九個月使適合於農民收穫時期利息則無妨略低月息一分爲最高率至於農産物品之輸出亦可由信用合作社代爲辦理名直接運輸之困難一般市價亦不至於受豪劣之操縱苟自江浙以至其他各省次第推行則農村之更生庶或有一線之望矣</p>

<p>主張將霍斯與寇丁兩議員前所提出之菲列濱獨立案重行提出、而附以在菲島獨立後、美國即放棄該島美陸軍根據地之修正文、查此案在一年前由國會通過、但因菲政府不接受之、則今年當然失效、原案規定菲島在十二年至十四年内獨立、後仍可保持其菲島之海陸軍根據地、今羅總統願放棄陸軍據地、至於海軍根據地、則羅總統主張將來垠據雙方翻可滿意之辦法面解决之、羅總統聲稱、渠不信原案中其他文現須修改、渠確信凡不完善及不平等之處、儘可於適當陳訴後糾正之、而無所損於雙方云、羅總統又曰、余欲聲明者、吾人固欲於最早適當時期完成菲島之獨立、但完成其獨立而不有充分時間、以謀政治與經濟上之必要調整、則直予菲島人民以不公道、其異於拒絕獨立也幾希、此時若更原案之經濟條文、徒使吾人爲人輕視耳、吾國不垂涏他人土地亦不欲違反以戰爭獲其主權的人民之志願而覊縻之云、此案已立卽提交衆院、星期一日委員會卽將開始審查、（二日路透電）</p>

<p>巴黎據報載、國防會議將研究下列軍縮問題之解决辦法、然後答復英國之建議、卽（一）德國保留適合凡爾賽和約之目前軍備地位、與其他列强依某種擔保而實行軍縮、（二）締結條約、規定其他列强之軍備應仍居目前之程度、而許德國重置軍備至某種限度、歸國際監督、（三各國）行動之完全自由、消息靈通各界現信、國防會議對此三種决議極難下一斷語、因就法國眼光而論、其中有利有不利也、（三日國民電）</p>
<p>巴黎歐洲大局現忽有不安穏之勢力横襲而來、蓋據今日消息、法國有不滿意於英國軍縮計畫之意志也、昨日法外長巴京都答覆衆院外交委員會提出之條問時、曾表示法政府之態度、謂法國擬批駁英國之計畫、因其中未列試騐時期、就法政府目光而論、此種遺漏將使法國實行軍縮、而德國則反重置軍備、如英國計畫一經接受、則德國在第一年砲隊與坦克車將優於法國再、英國計畫中並無制裁之担保、所規定之會商必無濟於事云、法内閣决議拒絕德總理希特勒所提出重置軍備之請求、德國如必欲重置軍備、須遵守法國提出之限制、如能商獲妥協、法國尙須請英國出而担保、遇德國破壞條件時英國當衛護法國、</p>
<p>同時路透電社華盛頓訪員電稱、稽諸美國務副卿斐列浦與英大使林德賽之談話紀錄、美政府對軍縮之意見實與英國脗合、斐列浦曾告英大使、美國表同情於英國之建議、希望彼此可復從事一般軍縮討論而獲成功云、</p>

<p>舊事重提的淗區正在開發的石油本年度俄轄領沿岸的瀂業投標、因日本投標、都是照每一盧布合日金三十二錢五厘計算、蘇聨遠東漁業長官、認爲與現實不合、遂宣告日本投標完全無效、單獨由蘇聨人民投標、換一句話講、就是現在投標的八十四處漁區、都没有日人的分了、在蘇聨遠東漁業長官所持的理由、這事情雖尙未經蘇聨中央正式認可、但在理論事實上都有根據、第一就是日蘇的漁業方面、關於盧布與日金的兌換率、是由蘇聨駐日大使脫洛雅洛夫斯基與日本外長幣原喜重郎協定的、當時日本、還保持金本制度、同時蘇聨也有一種發展對貿易的深意、但自一九三一年日本放棄金本位之後、日金對外匯兌價値、逐漸低落、到現在没有金平價的二分之一、則是蘇聨因此收入、當然要吃虧、卽地方財政、也感受莫大的影響、所以不能不對此加以糾正、再則第一五年計劃、旣有相當的成功、對外關係、更次第轉好、於日本帝國主議者的猛進、尤不得不有適當的對策、所以竟直接宣告日本人的投標無效、</p>
<p>蘇聨遠東漁業長官、旣然宣告了他的宗旨、日方當然不服、要提出抗議、據日本方面所持的理由是、（一）盧布的兌換率、是一九三一年脫洛雅洛夫大使與幣原外長協定、確定爲每盧布爲日金三十二錢五厘、蘇聨不與日本協商、不待日本允許、卽宣言破棄該兌換率、是違背協定、（二）遠東漁區的租貨投標權、日蘇兩國人民共同有之、并無何等差别、現在蘇聨單獨宣告日人投標無效、是遠反日俄漁業條約、這種差别特過、日本决不承認、日本將根據上述理由、與蘇聨爭辯、這次的事實、比從前還更激烈、但是蘇聨有他一貫的貨幣政策、盧布對外匯兌的價格、須由國立銀行公定、同時禁止盧布出境、秘密帶出是要被没收的外國貨幣入境、也受着嚴重的限制、則日本所持的兌換率協定的說法、也祗有一面的理由、與蘇聨根本國策、不能相容、所以這個問題、不易解决、還有是庫頁島北部的石油採掘問題、在一九二九年、由北庫頁石油公司開採、到現在投下資本約計五百頁、日政府的補助金、一九三二年、祗有十萬日金、一九三三年、也不過二十三萬日金、而試掘一口油井、就要用三四十萬圓、所以該公司的資本、十分薄弱、現在曾經開採的區域、僅及於有權試採區域的二十分之一、而試採成功的區域、不過北俄哈一處、卽將本年内試採將要成功的加單格里區都加進去、其區域也是很小、并且鑛脈貧弱、前途的希望不大、最近日本方面、曾計劃再投下二百八十萬圓的新資本、想開七口新井（現正在工作中的有六口井）、可是北庫頁島煌油田、如要積極開採、單以日本有租借權的部分而論、最少也要開五十口井、其所須資本、要一千五百萬以至二千萬日金、與現在情形相比、眞有天壞之差、我們再觀蘇聨開採該處的石油、運用他國營托拉斯的財力、現在採油的數量、年産約三十萬噸、經過第二五年計劃、到一九在七年、卽將到達一百二十萬噸的産量、日本的北庫頁石油公司、卽使現在努力増加生産、也不過年産二十萬噸、并且還有一個焦急的問題、就是蘇日石油試採租借權、到一九三六年、卽試採有效期滿、照目前形勢推移下去、其試採的地域、非放棄不可、卽已試採成功的、也要受蘇聨同業的强硬抵制、日本攫取石油的野心、將不免成爲一種幻想（一九三四年二月十二日）</p>

<p>話又說回來了、我們在南寗總共佳了四十八天、這一個半多月的時間、就全部消耗於參考資料、編製表格、劃分調查區域、以及製造預算中、最使我們工作感覺困難的、還是初步調查材料</p>
<p>之闕如、與現有參考資料之貧乏、各廳各機關的公報、章雜誌的文章、也不足供我們作調查計劃之用、此外、就祗有統計局一部分的統計資料、卽預備編廣西年鑑的手稿、但因他們所用的方法、間接調查而不是直接調查、該局將擬好了的表格寄給各縣政会、由縣長塡報、所以村料頗多有疑義的地方、楊綽菴先生對統計資料、、素來主張寗濫毋缺、有勝於無</p>
<p>、這與我們向來的治學態度、也微有不同、在這種環境下、初步調查資料的缺如、迫使我們不得不把工作範圍擴大爲農工商業三方面、我們决定組織了一個廣西經濟調查團、分農工商業三組、農業組由韓德章君、工業組由吳半農君、商業金融組由我分别組由我分别負責、每組内招請調查員五六</p>
<p>人至十數人不等、調查員多爲統計局主辦的計術人員養成所卒業的學生、他們曾受過了初步統計與調查的學術訓練、此外、統計局亦派有幾位同事參加、計參加農業組的爲張俊民劉宣兩先生、（金陵大學農科畢業）參加工商業組的爲陽明炤劉炳新兩先生、（清華大學畢業）我們的工作</p>
<p>計劃、大致是這樣的、</p>
<p>農業調查、中心問題、農作方面注重糧食及重要工業原料之品種、品質、産量、耕種方法、及成本、農業經濟方面、注重農家生産、及消費狀况、農家副業業、租佃制度、及農村金融問題、調查區</p>
<p>域、（一）全縣、（二）陽朔、（三）賀縣、（四）容縣、（五象縣）（六）宜山、（七）南丹（八）藤縣、（九）玉林、（十賓陽、（十一）果）</p>
<p>德（十二百色、）（十三）龍州、</p>
<p>工業調查、中心問題、此項調查約分四方面進行、（一爲家）庭工業、（二）爲科工工廠、、（三）爲用動力之小工廠、（四）爲新式大工廠、注重之問題、約分生産關係、原料供給、生産、原料供給、生産</p>
<p>成本、運銷情形、勞工生計、及近年來各業盛衰情形與原因等等、又廣西民間工業、以織布業爲最並遍、但廣西人民之衣着、尙多仰給於外省或海外、外（查近年棉花棉紗及棉布之輸入、年約達）毫洋二千萬元、形成三口貿易人超逐年增加之主要原因、此點至堪注意、調查時當特别加以重視、調查區域、（一）南寗、（二）梧州（三）柳州、城、（四當賀鐘、（五）桂林、靈川（六賓陽、（七）宜山）（八）都安（九）鬱林、（十）容縣、（十一）平南、（十二）平樂、（十三）龍州商業金融調查、中心問題、商業方面、注重各地之商情、市况、各商店主要物品之銷售、營業之盈虧、各大宗進出口貨物之運銷、價格之變遷、等等、金融方面、注重各地之金融機關、金融市况、幣制、典當業、等等、調查區域、（一）梧州、（二）寗、、（三）龍州、（四）百色、（五）桂林、（六柳）州、（七）入步（八）桂平、（九平樂、）、（十）　林、（十一）貴縣、</p>
<p>調查的工作計劃决定後、我們就作出發前的準備、、如購買行軍床、藥品、置辦標本揉集箱印各種調查表格、等等、我們的調查表共十一種、每種自、二三買至十數頁不等、、幸賴我們的月友賴彦于先生（廣西印務局局長）、竭力幫忙、使表格得以如期印就、這是我們在這次調查中特别値</p>
<p>得申謝的、</p>
<p>但在没能實地出發調查之前、我還得說一說廣西的語言、本來、中國各地方言之多、不但省與省殊、縣與縣别、卽一縣之内、城廂與鄉下亦有不同、此不僅於桂省爲然、但廣西却無疑地是語言最複雜的一省、他們有所謂官話白話、平話、客話、客話、控話容話、猺話、苗話、　話、猓猓話、種類之繁多、歳至不可究詰、而各縣各有其的本鄉的土話、尙不計在内、我們可以說一句没有一個廣西人會說各地的廣西話、正如没有一個中國人會說各省的中國話一様、在廣西最流行的要算官話與白話、所謂官話、通行於桂林柳州一帶、亦稱桂桂林官話、較北京話梢平、而與湖北話及四川話相類似、白　話卽廣東話、粤語之稱『白話』的理由、不得其詳、此種白話通行於西江流域及桂省南部、大約是因爲接近廣東的綠故、此外如撞話、平話、客家話、亦極占勢力、往往一縣之内、數種語言並用、如柳州操官話者、約占百分之六十操撞、白、源南、客家話者、各占百分之十、南寗亦官話白話、平話撞話並用、一縣之中祗用一種語言者、幾絕無而僅有、廣西民政廢會根據民政視察員報告、製成廣西各種語言百分比較圖、據該圖所示、則官話可通行的縣數佔百分之五四、八九、白話通行縣數占百分之六二、二二、客話縣數占百分之五一、○六、平話縣數占百分之一九、一五、本地話縣數占百分之四○、二四、撞話縣數占百分之二五、九三、猺話占百分之二二、九五、苗話縣數占百分之八、一五、秱話縣數占百分之二、二二、總共加起來、是百分之二八六、八一、可知各縣平均都用二種語言以上、我們這一次所跑的地方這麽多、分佈區域又那麽疏散、所遭遇語言不通的困難當然是特别嚴重的、幸好所帶的調查員、多桂省人、他們並通都會兩種話卽廣西宣　　白話、也有許多發會撞話與客家話的、這個問題總算勉强解决了、</p>

<p>這時我雖然是非常興奮地在寫這一封信、希冀先生會指示我解决這些自學困難的途徑，但恐我所要求的希冀溢出貴部訂定的範圍以外，或者先生不會答覆我的要求吧？因此我雖大</p>
<p>且仍握筆寫下去，但多少是很担心着的。可不知先生果眞棄我不答覆嗎？大約總不至於吧？我想是。</p>
<p>先生！我是同前天在『讀書間答』欄内發表的周筠君一樣對於新文藝有信仰心和創作野心的人；並且我也是一但從小學衰卒業輟學了的毫無文字根底的人；而我的環境又是同周君一模一樣的、我是一個店員、遭遇着時間上的約束、祗有夜間八點鐘至十點鐘間的二個寳貴的鐘頭的餘閒可以盡量自由作業。在這二個極寳貴極寳貴的小時中、我雖有决不肯給它隨便放棄的願望，但是當我檢閱一下過去在這二個鐘頭内作些什麽時，眞有點難以自信了。周君曾說··一反不可知的未來的努的結果，和過去及現在的空虚一比擬，眞呌我有些茫然！在困難無規律的自修中，腦哀常會現出涉茫來一並且說··一有時甚至連字典也懶得查，不能了解的地方，也是請敎無門。就這樣，就這樣，光陰是飛逝、，年齡是増大了，有什魔成續呢？空虚，迷茫！一他這幾句自白的話，的確可俄我的寫照呀！當我讀周君的那封信時，更使我感到自慚的就是像周君自謙以爲無規律的自修中、能由小學生的程度而飛躍到能寫像樣一封文字流俐有條不紊的信是差可自慰了而我一檢閱自已過去的所謂自修時、眞使我更深一層地失了自认的勇氣。（未完）</p>

<p>— 寒玉</p>
<p>小朋友！你們有創造的精神、和創造的經騐麽？</p>
<p>你们和同伴或同學遊戲的時候，除了平常所做的捉迷藏，推羅漢之外，你能夠創造别種遊戲出來，使一同遊戲的人，都感覺到興趣。這就是創造的精神。</p>
<p>小朋友！你們不要看輕了創造的精神。世一界上的發明家，都是有了創造的精神，絻會把物品發明出來的，美國的愛迪生，他本來是一個賣報的童子，但是他很有創造的精神。所以他絡續發明了電燈，電話，留聲機。給我們利用着。</p>
<p>小朋友！現在正是你們練習創造的精神和經騐的時候。你們不要看輕了遊戲時候的創造，因爲這是最好的機會去練習創造的經騐。你們要隨時隨地，用創造的精神，去養成創造的經騐。那麽，你們要成功一個愛迪生，也不是極難的事。</p>
<h3 id="c229">關於模仿的話 <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— 俊思</p>
<p>小朋友，你不是時常歡喜模仿大人們的動作，或是在觀劇回來仿着劇中的人物表演嗎？在這裏，我告訴你，這正是你内心富於模仿性的自然流露據研究，這種模仿性，正是兒童的普遍心理，所以如果你的父母，或老師是懂得兒童心理的，那麽他們决不會來干涉或禁止你的動作，因爲强制的禁止反而會有害於你的身心。</p>
<p>不過，小朋友，你應該留意呵！現實的社會是這樣的缺陷，你們的前途更是滿佈着陷阱，所以你的模仿應該息樣的鄭重；大人們的動作　然是不全是對的同如吸烟，喝洒酒，賭博等一切都與你們不利，就是歷史上的人物也有許多行爲是不對，在這裏，你就應該模仿其長處，而捨其短處，自然囉，對於一切的模仿，事前都應該好好的甚斟酌一下。　　模仿並不是件壞事，譬如日本它雖是個黷武的國家，同時是我們的仇敵，但是它的所以能够强盛，佔世界上的要位，也是模仿歐戰前的德國而來的呀！</p>

<p>以冷咖啡請客，我是很抱歉的。主人向富蘭克林道歉。</p>
<p>『没有什麽！』不過，那是剛才泡好的，爲什麽一刻兒就冷去呢？富蘭克林疑惑地問。</p>
<p>『啊，那是我的僕人太懶惰的緣故啊』主人答。『長期間。這隻杯子不曾洗察過。顔色黑黝黝，泡好的茶比往日冷得快了。』</p>
<p>主人的觖答，給與富蘭克林以另一種推想，他想到窗外的雪堆。</p>
<p>回家時，富蘭克林將一塊白布和一塊黑布蓋在雪上，好久同，才反兩塊布掀開來看。黑布下面的雪，已消融凈盡，白布下面，只融去一半。</p>
<p>富蘭克林在實騐中證明了『白色拒熱，黑色吸熱一的道理。</p>

<p>— 伯眞</p>
<p>上海的小友Ｗ兄自去冬和燦分别以來，一轉眼已有數月了，很想念您哩！</p>
<p>隆冬的天氣，一切花枯的枯，死的死，惟有那梅花，能亭亭玉立，放出清香馥郁的花朶來，和那殘酷的風雪抵抗，眞不愧做我們的國花啊！</p>
<p>我們蘇州的鄧尉，久以産梅者名，『香雪海』三字，誰都知道。現在梅药花盛開的時候，遥望遇去，一片雪也似的白色中間，夾着許多紅梅綠梅，互相映照，看了眞使人悅目賞心，精神爲之勃發，一般文人雅士，大都愛梅，梅實是花中之翹楚。</p>
<p>近日天氣較爲和暖，百花漸地露出復活的形態，枝上顯在嬌嫩的芽，春風吹上來、也很有暖意了，這正是游玩的好日子呀！</p>
<p>您們在都市中那裏來的梅花，卽使有的園子裏可以看到，想心也没有我們這裏來得多。我曾聽得人們說，這幾天上鄧尉探梅的人很多很多。我想去遊玩一下，但是一人獨，没有多大的趣味，因此想約您星期日休假時同去，不知您有這興致嗎？祝您學業進步蘇州的小月友Ｃ啓</p>

<p>— 東林</p>
<p>鴿子看見往在同一樹林的貓頭鷹，很　忙地預備着遷居，好奇地問它道··『你爲什麽要遷居呢？』貓頭鷹憤憤地加答首『這裏附搂的人們都厭惡』</p>
<p>我的呌聲，因此我只有離開這裏到别處去！』鴿子聽完了它的話，禁不住哈哈笑。並且忠告它道『隨你遷到什麽地』方去，附近的人們都會厭惡你的呌聲的。你除非把你伯呌聲矯正好，遷居亦是徒然！』</p>
<p>自已的影子，是隨處會跟着你走。不求改正自已本身，而埋怨影子的灣曲，這是一種很可憐的行爲。然而這世界上却有很多這種人！小朋友們，讓我們從小時起，就避免這種弊病吧！</p>
<h3 id="c233">這是什麽緣故？ <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 人偉</p>
<p>媽媽拿了一隻藍花大碗，放在桌子的中央，碗中放進一個小銅錢，對伊的十歲女孩菱妹說道『菱妹！你』</p>
<p>過來！這兒有一個很好頑的頑意兒給你瞧，同時也可以増進你的科學常識你站在桌子旁邊，不要動！這碗底可有什麽東西麽一？菱妹身體矮小，當然年不見那個碗底的銅錢所以伊回答『媽媽！我没有見什麽』。媽媽說道··『這碗底有一個錢，現在你旣然看不見，就是因爲你的身體太低的緣髟故··但是我有一個法子，能够使你看見碗底的錢，並不將碗移近你，也不把碗傾側，也不要你的脚證高起來····』菱妹顯着懐疑的神態說道··『媽媽，我不信』！媽媽微笑着，不說話··但看見伊用一碗水，僈慢地傾在那隻碗裏，說也奇怪，菱妹的眼裏，頓時顯現着一個小小的銅錢。</p>
<p>菱妹跑過揑着媽媽的衣角，用更懐疑的目光，向媽媽問道··『這是什麽緣故呀』？媽媽輕輕地撫摩着菱妹的小手說道’··『菱妹，我給你頑這個頑意兒，』</p>
<p>就是要你知道個中的道理。這是因爲光綫本來是直進的；但通過了，會變了它直進的方向，所以加了水就能够看見碗底的銅錢了』。</p>

<p>— 許洛</p>
<p>有一位小朋友，名宛呌雪兒，他生的時候，醫生告訴雪兒的母親水，不要讓雪兒走近熱的地方，因爲他走近熱的時候，要死了。所以雪兒的母親水。從來不肯使雪兒走近熱的地方，　　有一天，雪兒一定要母親水告訴他，他是怎樣生出來的？母親就說··『雪兒，你··就是我身上的一部分。有一天，太陽先生把我晒着，所以我的一部分身體就變成很輕的水蒸氣·和鳥兒一樣的飛到了天空中，天天在天空中玩，一天，空中冷得很，就把這水蒸氣變成了你</p>
<p>，由風先生帶了下來了。』雪兒聽了，就去告訴另外的小朋友們。</p>
<p>另外的小朋友們都很喜歡雪兒，因爲雪兒很美麗，臉兒很白，而且他的身上很冷，和其餘的小朋友都是兩樣的。雪兒常常捉田裏很壞的小蟲，所以小朋友們的父母也很喜歡雪兒。</p>
<p>一天，小朋友們大家很快樂的在圍着火跳舞，雪兒見了，也很快的跑了過去，。但是剛走近火的時候，雪兒就死了。</p>
<h3 id="c237">兒童的遊戲生活 <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 少問</p>
<p>兒童們都是很天眞的。他們的腦筋都像一張白紙樣，什麽都没有。但他們都喜歡工作，喜歡模彷他們所看見所聽見的一切事情這在他們的行動上表現出來，便是遊戲。所以兒童遊處，是他們獲得知能的開始。當父母的人，兒童敎育家，都應該特别注意兒童的遊戲生活。在這中間去敎育他們，比較死板的用書本去敎育他們，是能收到更大的效果的。</p>
<p>在指導兒童的遊戲生活中，最主要的是當培養他們的科學知識。譬如，在他們拍皮球時，京當告訴他們爲什麽皮球被拍在地上就會跳起來··在他們開小汽車時，就當告訴他們一些關於汽車的知識····至於那些無聊的遊戲，不能使兒童得到什麽知識的遊戲，便不應該讓他們去做。</p>
<p>在遊戲生活中去敎育兒童，是最好的兒童敎育方法。我們反對那些輕視兒童遊戲的一切傾向。</p>

<p>（一）一月三日今天是我的生日。上午，父親要到街市上去買玩具，送給我做生日的禮物。我對父親說··『爸爸！請你不要買』父親問我爲什麽？我說··『因爲我想起東北的小朋友，現在都是過那苦痛的生活，有的連飯也吃不飽，所以我不願意享樂。』父親聽了我的話，很是稱讚我。</p>
<p>（二）一月七日今天上植物學的時候，徐先生講到『植物的年輪』那一段說··『我們鋸斷一』</p>
<p>顆樹，細數它幹上的圈數，便可以知道這顆樹有多少年紀。一我聽了這话，覺得委有趣味。但是不懂這是什麽原因，所以又問先生。先生說··『樹的生長，』完全是液材在那裏生長。液材所在的部位，是在樹皮和樹心木質的中間，液材裏環繞着樹心木質生長，每年生長一圈，這些圈呌做年輪。所以我們數樹的年輪，便知這它有多少年紀。』我聽了這話，不覺恍然大悟起來。可見求學問只要肯多問，决不會不明白的。</p>

<p>小朋友你在銀行裏可有儲蓄金嗎？你不是以爲祇有人才會儲蓄嗎？可是假使你這樣想，那你就錯了。因爲不是人也會儲蓄的，現在讓我來告訴你幾個例子··</p>
<p>一蜜蜂牠把花裏的蜜採集攏來，儲蓄在牠的蜂房裏，以備將來在冬天天冷，不能找到食物時吃的。</p>
<p>二駱駝牠是生長在沙漠裏的，因爲沙漠裏要找到水是很不容易的，所以牠常常把水儲藏在背上的兩個肉峯裏，（了有一個肉峯的）所以牠在找不到水的時候，也不要緊的。</p>
<p>上面所說的，是兩種會儲蓄的動物。下面，我再講一種有儲蓄本能的植物</p>
<p>三蘿　牠在平日把營養物一些一些慢慢的儲蓄在根鄽裏，這根就是我們平日所吃的蘿　，是作爲將來種子發芽時候的肥科的。</p>

<p>— 學范</p>
<p>小朋友們念敢一天書，閒的時候，還玩要得很累，到了晚上不是覺得很疲倦，需要眠嗎？假使不給你睡眠，一定要感到難受，這爲什麽呢？因爲一個人的腦部不能一天到晚，繼續不斷的使用，用了天，一定要有數小時的休息，這休息便是睡眠··不過休息也不宜太太久。像你們小朋友，們睡眠十小時已够··像成人門，睡眠八小已够。</p>
<p>睡眠並非人顃特殊的需要，無論那種動物，都需要睡眠。不過别種動物睡眠時的狀態，很多和人類不同的。像我們人類睡眼起來，一定要睡在牀上，平平坦坦，方稱適意··但是像馬，它們睡眠起來，四足舊立在地上，僅把眼皮闔攏，就是睡眠。如果人類要他立直了睡眠，一定要跌交，而是辦不到的。此外如蝙蝠它們睡起來，更其特别它們把兩隻脚倒掛在樑上，這樣便暒眠了，睡眠本來是身體最舒適的休息，像蝙蝠把身子頂倒掛起</p>
<p>來、算是最舒適，豈不奇怪呢！其餘如魚類·簡２直辨不出它們的睡眠狀態是怎樣的，魚類最靈警，只要我們跑到水缸邊，魚類便敏捷地又在游來游去了，小朋友們，是不是呢？</p>
<p>其餘的動物，特别怕睡眠狀態還多，因怕本文寫得太冗長，留着下次再談吧。</p>

<p>— 力生譯</p>
<p>ＥＬondonderryNntionnlRfficiencyTheNineteentllCentrfyandatersanrary1934作者倫敦德莉女士是現化英國最大婦女團體『婦女軍』的首腦··雖然不過是一個狹量的國家主義的女英雄、但她手下有四萬個有組織的壯健婦女唯她馬首是瞻、這足見其氣魄的非凡，以及影響於英國國防的重大。本文寫英國婦女團體過去和現在對國防上的有力活動，明潔而饒興味··當此國際風雲緊張之秋，可爲吾國醉生夢的太太小姐們之警鐘，亦可爲有時代覺醒的新婦女的借鏡··並可一掃男子們對於婦女輕視的觀念。因特譯出，以實本園地··惟以篇幅關係，只得删略數處。譯者識</p>
<p>世界大戰與婦女世界大戰正使交戰國的婦女，脫離了經濟上隸屬於男子的最後覊絆。戰爭中，她們被賦與了前此未曾從事過的種種重大任務。而且無論怎樣偏惡婦女的人，也不得不承認，大體上她們是並無遺憾地盡了好她們的任務了。她們所從事的職業是千差萬别，其中常有複雜困難須經特别訓練者，而她們竟逹到男了意想以上的成功。</p>
<p>英國婦女所從事的職業，例如看護婦，藥劑師，按摩，烹飪，通報，製造軍用品，傳令，駕駛等，她們有許多都因有功而得了勳章。又戰事終了後，她們所屬的團體，都由國王或女王或女王賜與感謝之辭。當時英國訓練婦女的成績，至今還留存着··就是說、現在英國的婦女比過去任何時代都能作事，都有獨立性。再，她們有向機械和航空方面努力的精神。尤其可喜的是、因了戰時的活動而使協力的精神發達；這精神在社會的種種方面表現着。</p>
<p>婦女與組織大戰以來，婦妇成了非常卓越和組織者。她們在上自國會下至村會的合議團體裏發揮其以有力。在政治上，她們表現出能以獲得成功所必要的精細的注意力去應付；巽舉之際，則担任招待員，勸誘員和演說家以發揮其能力。她們有許多做市，街，村長大大的博得國民的好評，尤其就其勤勉和辦事能率講，只有超過於男子而無不及。高等職業方面，自從應許她們加入以來，在種種地方都是有利而無弊。她們現在也參與銀行，保險公司的事務。做建築家，律師，</p>
<p>醫師的也不少。做行政官，警察官的也有。大報館的幹部中也可以看到婦女。</p>
<p>婦女的職業培萊，慕莉蓀，葛萊　等女士是做飛行家而成名了。從事養鷄業的巴馬傑莉。馥士脫小姐，在俾士萊的打靶裏和。多男子競爭而得勝利，榮領了國王的奬章。海菜奈。諾曼頓夫人登記爲高等法院所屬的律師而盡其職務，證明了結婚生活並不因此而受何惡影響。担任裁判官的婦女也不少，她們尤其適宜於裁判少年案件，她們具有同情和理解，所</p>
<p>以少不了她們。她們做訪問司法官，担任視察獄中婦女生活和待遇的任務，於國家有好大的貢獻。</p>
<p>婦女自大戰以來，担當了如上所述的種種任務。但也不會因此而像保守者所慮的，竟忘了婦女的本分。她們不會失去常識的和健全的判斷，好比她們就很努力地想補救生理上不及於男子的弱點。但多數的婦女並無脫離家家庭本分任務的傾向。自已固希望輕易離開家庭，也認爲那樣的事是不容易辦到的。</p>
<p>下時的國際關係現在我們不能忽視表現於國際地平綫上的或種徵兆。在許多點上，歐洲的現狀是酷似一九一四年初的光景。日内瓦國際盟雖竟竭力謀國際的和平，而各國間的關係依然極呈緊張。由市塲爭奪而起的國際競爭，變爲政治的惡感，這惡感又因軍備的競爭而儘管繳烈直來。情勢旣如此，各國政便都對其國民，施行防毒面罩使用法等化學戰上的防禦法之訓練。最近視察歐洲二大陸軍國德意志和蘇聨回來的我的朋友們，說兩國都正在盛行防毒面罩的練習。在這兩國、表面上以製造肥料的名義而盡力製造合成的阿摩尼亞和硝酸。自然、一到戰時，此等物品必用以製穯造爆發物和毒瓦斯尤其是催涙瓦斯，發泡瓦斯。蘇聨往往使用飛機撤布流動的肥料，這也可以使用於戰鬭上，自不待言。</p>
<p>婦女團體現在是誰也不願慘酷的戰爭出現，但同時誰也不能担保其不出現了。在這當兒，對於國防有密切關係的婦女團體加一番考察，自屬必要。英國値得特别注意的婦女　體有兩個··一是純醫學的（有志婦女協班會，）一是負有廣汎的社會任務的『婦女軍』。後者卽由本人任會長之職。</p>
<p>有志婦女協助會原名TdeOrganizationofvoluntaryAidinEnglandandWales（英國及威爾斯有志婦女協助會），由陸軍部的援助，成立於一九零九年··最初的目的原欲作爲戰時國内地方的醫療機關，後來竟派到國外去協助陸海空軍的醫務。一九一四年宣戰時，英國</p>
<p>紅十字會和聖的約翰協會所徴募的分遣隊逹二千隊之多，人員超遇七萬，及至戰爭開始，其數復増加一半。自一九二三年，其活動範圍更形擴大，現在受過訓練的職員有看護婦，藥劑師，無綫電話技士，按摩師，實騐助，眼镜師等，訓練未成熟的有普通廚師，書記，見習看護等。又把她們分成動員的及不動員的二班，動員班由二十一歲以上四十歲以下的婦女，在戰時廣汎地從事國内外國軍的醫療和看護。她們的必修科是看護的理論和實際·隨意科是化學戰防禦法，衛生學，熱帶衛生學，烹飪學，育兒學等。現在尤因前述理由，而特别注意化學戰防禦法。最近胡增設了空中救護的組織。現在已有三個空中救護班。　　婦女軍（ＴheWomensleaion）由本人創立於一九一五年，其目的就是在有事之秋替代執干戈而赴軍的男子，爲國家出力。會員均着黃褐色制服，受規則嚴正的訓練，登記者已達四萬人。我最初要她們從事畊作，農家雖然歡迎她們，可是當時從各方面收到了嘲弄的匿名信，大部分是說這計劃根本是滑稽的，也有說，婦女男裝在街市行軍的樣子</p>
<p>，未免古太怪吧。　　軍國婦女本的本分本人的目的，决非想編成烈女隊或婦女義勇軍。婦女要對國有盡婦女的任</p>
<p>務，而並非相代替男子，做男子應做的事。婦女自是婦女，不可從與男子不同的地方去模仿男子。但做婦女對國家應盡的任務多得　。我之所以取名一婦女軍一，是因爲ＬＥＧＩＯＮ這一名詞，使我想起了古羅馬軍隊的能率烽訓練的可慕。這决不祗從軍隊的見地出發，我以爲應作爲一骰國民生活的基礎看。在我的腦中，覺着受過訓練的有力的婦女國體</p>
<p>到處存在着。我自始卽反對婦女的一切工任都是義務的這種意見。所以我除組織者，委員，宣傳者等之外，不使用義務的人員。自已常常抱着以婦女勞働者替代男子勞働去的主義。爲維持必要的統制和作業標凖的高度起見，支給相</p>
<p>當的報酬或手續費是極必要的。這就是一九一六年十一月軍需部所任的委員等亦認爲必要。他們說戰事終了爲止，英國的勞作約百分之八十是由支薪的婦女勞働者做的。</p>
<p>婦女軍與關係諸係諸團體婦女軍在戰爭中做了許多對於國家有偉大貢獻的旁枝團體的母體。可以稱作她的分隊的，有婦女土地軍，曼玲女王協助隊，婦女海軍，婦女空軍等。　婦女軍在戰時主要任務是關於輸送，使役，烹飪等工作，後來烹飪方面改由曼玲女王協助隊去掌管了。</p>
<p>此等有關軍事的團體之外，婦人軍對農作等須由婦女担任的一切作業，又没有分遣隊。但關於交通運輸等最重要的作業，如貨物和傷兵的運送，乃至傳令的役使等都儘量地由她們担任。戰爭終了後，主計總監沙，約翰。柯安稱讚婦女軍的運的運輸部說··『如果没有她們的助力，輸送的工作决不能那麽完密而敏捷。現在她們已成爲軍隊所不可缺的要素了、』。婦女軍的汽車部如今還作爲預備運輸部而存留着。</p>
<p>飩創立新婦女團體的計劃必要時，婦女團體可以儘量擴大。如最近報章上就載有司令官亞令要組織稱爲婦女後備軍的新團體之消息。其目的係在訓練關於救生，防禦毒氣，烹飪，運輸等戰時必要事項云。不過這與旣存團體的工作似科是重複而有觝觸的。</p>
<p>現存團體的改革所以我不得不反對組織關於軍事的新婦女團體的計劃而主張改革現存團體，置於嚴密的統制之下，給與以新的活氣，而作業的區分，依此後應作的範圍劃分。現在，把婦女軍改造，以待來日貢獻國家，實爲最適當的時機。我以爲在全國各地開辦烹飪講習會，並訓練婦女關於化學戰的防禦，機械的管理，海陸空軍的運輸傳令等智識技能，尤屬必要。</p>
<p>地方活動戰時在都市和地方，有待於婦女協助的都非常之多。而婦女團體的活動，則以地方爲基礎較爲便利。這决與現存的紅十字會，聖約翰協會或此等團體的支部之活動不衝突。因爲婦女軍會員人數遠勝一切婦女團體，故能依必要情形與各團體協力而爲國軍盡婦女的任務。　　大戰的敎訓如果一九一四年大戰爆發當時，已有經過充分訓練的婦女協助團體，那末就没有那麽慌忙的必要了。那通告全國急激募集看護婦，開催烹飪講習會，上下混雜的情形，至今還委新鮮地在我們的記憶　裏。這些都是在平常無事之時有充分準備之必要的。我們由大戰得到了大大的敎訓，忘了這敎訓是不可以的。</p>
<p>爲了國家的安全，婦女們繼續接受戰時受過的訓練，實爲必要。是等經騐，現在應由年輕的姊妹們來繼承。婦女們當國家有事之際，盡個人的或團體的能力去保護國家，亦爲分内之事。任何國家，當危急存亡之交，專恃男子之力是不够的，應行國民總動員才行。那末婦女倔在平時，積極凖備，實行充分的訓練和組織，是絕對必要的了。</p>
<h3 id="c243">世界女名人山額夫人 <a href="#c243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— 學文</p>
<p>在一九二二年，有一位拉倡節制生育的婦人到過我們中國，她就是山額夫人，挾着一種保護母性學說到各處宣傳。</p>
<p>她的節制生育的主張、一面是防止過多的人口，一面是要保護母性的自由，據她說，是可以救社會上的犯罪，災荒，戰爭等，所以也是一種改良社會的方法。她自幼年而至中年的種種生活情狀，都値得我們知道一下的，茲略述如下··</p>
<p>（一）幼年時代她是生長於紐約高寗地方，父親是一個富於想像的彫刻師，母親一共生了十一個小孩，她排行第五，家裏爲要使子女達到求學的願望，所以於經濟方面也不甚寬裕。</p>
<p>她在幼小的時候，常常得到父親嚴厲的敎訓，譬如說··『一個人生，必須有着他的一種想，我們爲着這種理想，就要有一番大努力，』所以他敎導小孩的時候，時常這樣說道··『你們現在必須有一種夢想或幻象，你們以後就要爲實現那夢想而奮鬥。』山額夫人常常受到這樣一種啓示、所以在小時候也早　就知道人生的趨向了。</p>
<p>她小時還有一種好看護的習性，譬如看見有病的貓，以及其他家畜，她總</p>
<p>悉必的去醫治··鄰近無家的小孩，她彷佛他們的母親一般，忠告他們不要擾事，同伴們在游戲的時候傷了，好便去包</p>
<p>裏受創的手指，總之委像一個看護者一般。</p>
<p>她在那時候，又發覺件悲慘的事實，就是許多遊伴，若是得到了勞動保證書，便離家入廠作工去了，她細細研究，知道他們所以不能再受敎育，而要到工廠中去，因家中有小弟站妹，父母受着經濟的壓迫。</p>
<p>（二）少女時代此後，她寄宿在一個學校裏讀書。在這個時代，她很喜歡體育，如籃球，舞蹈等，她都踴躍參加，那學校裏有五百多人，她與同學們做各種的課外活動，最熱心的，爲練習演說。</p>
<p>有一次，她决定演說女子參政的必要，但練習的時候，被同學們玩笑作樂</p>
<p>，因此非常爲難，於是，好私下裏跑到</p>
<p>離開學校哩遠的地方，在一個葬地上自已指手劃脚的說起來。這時，聽衆和講師都是她自家一個，後來在集會上當衆演說了，却引起了大家的注意，於是結果組織了一個參政運動的團體，那時候，她才十四歲哩。</p>
<p>後來，她進紐紐醫院習業，研究四年、畢業了醫學研究科，好學的是内科與看護。在這四年中，她親見生産與死亡的悲苦，於是在她的思想上，更加上了一種力量了。</p>
<p>（三）结婚以後她的醫學功課結束之後，就和山額結婚，山額是研究藝術的。</p>
<p>她婚後仍舊從事於看護事業、一直繼續了十四年，在這許多年期中，她親見一般貧苦家庭，受多子之累，陷於悲</p>
<p>苦的生活境遇裏，因此，她漸漸覺得女子解放的必要條件，實在是需要一個健全的身體，理想方面，無論怎樣崇高，若是一做了母親、就什麽都不能實現了　　好又見到一個貧窮的女子，以非科學的主法防止妊娠，結果却中毒而死了，於是她深信節制生育，尤須有科學的方法，到一九一四年，她便將好的主張向一般社會宣傳。</p>
<p>但是，她在宣傳時期中，曾被人屢次控告，有一次被捕下獄，經人多方營救而纔得恢復自由。她在本國設立的宣傳機關，有二十餘處，一九二二年來亞洲宣傳，到日本時，曾初阻止上　、後來强制她不許宣傳　　能登陸，是　　日本到我國，在北平，上海，香港等處，有過幾次講演。</p>
<h3 id="c244">新婦女的意義 <a href="#c244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— 文</p>
<p>婦女佔人類的半數，另外半數是男子。原先這人類的现個半數生活於同一的社會中除了互相生産和互相分配以外不會發生甚麽問題出來，但是由於生活技術之差異，和數千年來對建宗法社會重重束縳的結果，婦女到了今日被視爲成爲問題的半數人類。我們今日所聽到的所謂『婦女問題、』下像『猶太人問題』『黑奴問題』少數的特殊民族問題似的被討論和被研究眞是婦女界莫大的恥辱。</p>
<p>普通的所謂『婦女問題』卽是婦女的經濟生活問題。幾千年來婦女在社會中的地位卽是寄生的地位，因爲生活技術的不同，婦女所能盡力的，除了服侍丈夫看護小孩和處理家丌事以外，就不爲社會所需要，社會的經濟生活完全操縱在男子手中，而婦女却失去她的獨立性。　　但是這種生活祗能穏定在幾千年的封建社會中，隨了社會經濟的變化而同時發生社會變化的時候，這種生活就必須師於消滅。我們今日興起討論的所謂『婦女問題，』剛是發生在封建社會巨大崩潰和寄生階級普遍動摇的現階段，而不發生於封建社會的全盛時代婦女被作爲商品買賣的一階段，尤其證明婦女問題不是單獨的問題，而是整個的社會改造問題之一，而解决婦女的問題也不是單獨的解决所能奏效，必須在整個社會問題的總解决之中，連帶地求得解决的實效。</p>
<p>婦女的地位誠然是受社會和『先天』所註定的如此不幸，但是婦女自已毁棄自已在社會中的地位，整列的從獨立生活的隊伍中沈逃避出來，顯然應該歸咎婦女本身。我們拿目瓣的事實來看、不能够了解她自已存在於社會中的意義而放棄她獨立的生活鬥爭的義務，甘心地在男子的奴役下來討生活的婦女仍不知有多多少少，而且這種婦女尤其全部是智識階級和資産階級的號稱覺悟的婦女。　　我們現在必須把新婦女的定義從新估定過，新婦女，必須在家庭中掙脫男子的奴役而作爲重要的一員之外、又必須爭取社會的地位作爲社會中的重要的一員。這兩者是連貫的。</p>
<p>婦女解放的責任負在婦女自已身上，亦在婦女參加實際的社會生活和對社會問題作協力的總解决之上。</p>
<h3 id="c245">勞働婦女生活的片段 <a href="#c245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>春天到了！一羣帶着發財希望的人們，依然要過着很難發財的生活，成千成萬的勞働婦女，從春到冬，從早到晚，從鄉下到城市，從家庭到工廠，誰不是爲了生活壓迫而忙碌。但人們只能很輕髮的知道她們爲生活而勞働，往往忽視了她們在勞働之下的生活是多麽値得注意的嚴重狀况。</p>
<p>人類生存誰也不可否認有許多生活上必需的條件，如休息，娱樂，衛生，敎育·····尤其婦女，在幼女時代生理發育之注意、成年時代母體健康之保護等等。不幸得很，我們勞働界的女同胞們，離開人類生活太遠了呵·</p>
<p>充滿了機械運動巨響的車間，排列着淡黃色昏暗的電燈，睡眼朦朧，膚浮腫，四肢無力，目光滯澁的婦女們，不是打着呵欠在紗廠工作，就是打着磕睡在絲廠工作，從晚六時起，要工作到第二天早晨六時。當舞女們倦了，飛鳥也　了，東方發白了，　車開始在　　上活動了的時候，她們才能成羣的用沉重的兩腿，拖着軟綿的身體，冒着朔風，離開龐大的工廠，走回低狹的家庭於是，喂着孩子，燒着飯，做着針綫，洗着衣···。夜間索乳的嬰兒，只好帶在身邊，使幼弱神經，飽受着機器震動着巨響的刺激，微的弱呼吸器官多量的呼吸着污濁的空氣，幸運的或能哺着母親營養不足的乳，漫漫的長大起來。　　『今生命苦，我們要修修來世，』紗廠女工在車間灰塵滿佈的空氣裏、取出飯籃中帶來隔夜的冷飯，泡着廠中未經濾過熱水管裏的熱水，嚥着蘿　乾的時</p>
<p>候，這樣向同伴說明了雖小魚小蝦亦不瞧吃的吃素的原因。在一餐飯中若有人吃帶來的兩個鹹鴨蛋，這是會引起大家的注意而驚奇其太浪費了的。她們通常的菜蔬多半是炒豆，蘿　乾，黃豆芽，雪裏紅，等。吃青菜豆腐，那是太貴些了。不錯，以她們的收入，自然不能吃到較好的飲食，更談不到食物質量是否合於人體的需要了，何况還有不少的勞働婦女待齋呢。</p>
<p>春天到了，春風的和暖，春景的美麗，都足以啓發人們的智慧，陶治人們的性情。奮發人們的精神。固然大自然並不會偏私而一樣普惠及勞働婦女，然而她們是無福享受的。她們是不問春日的花，秋夜的月，也不管夏日的雨冬天</p>
<p>的雪，她們只是每日刻板的在路燈光下幽靈般的走進工廠，不見天日的在高大的車間受着水蒸氣與車油氣的熱襲。她們機械的生活　固定的環境錢是不需要任何智慧思想的。她們只悉米糧漲價，</p>
<p>只悉工資减低。到放工時，依然幽靈般的在路燈光下走回家去。</p>

<p>— 毛瑞</p>
<p>這在天災人禍國難緊張的嘶聲裏，突然的有我們婦女界的導師出世，來喚醒中國一般夢的婦女們，這是我們婦女界的福音，也是國家社會的福音啊！　　大家知道自從『五四』運動之後，中國的社會裏，也會充滿了解放婦女的口號，來承接歐美婦女運動的遺産，但是看看今日的中或婦女界有無解放到光明道途呢？一部分有知識的婦女們已經從鄉村裏跑到都市裏向着摩登化的途徑跑了，做着『愛』美的蜜夢，沉醉着一般青年的靈魂。</p>
<p>在鄉村裏大多數的婦女們，仍舊的被壓迫的麻木了。</p>
<p>中國婦女角解放所得的結果，就是製造了許多承銷東相洋貨的女主顧，和戀愛幕中的角色而已。今日我們所唯一希望於婦女園地的是喚醒中國一般摩登化的婦女們走向鄉村醒覺這大多數的農村中被壓迫而過着牛馬生活的婦女們，大家來走向婦女光明的大道，來洗雪中國婦女摩登的污點錢這是我們婦女圖地裏目前最迫切的一回工作啊！</p>

<h3 id="c271">『經濟妻』的經濟價値 <a href="#c271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— 但令</p>
<p>考一般人擇妻的標凖，最主要的不外平這幾點·</p>
<p>（一）『年青』，以年青到『二八青春』『荳蔲年華』爲最美滿的程度；</p>
<p>（二）『美貎』，以美神『花容朋貎』『秀色可餐』爲最高的理想；此外如『必必温和』『體格健全』以及門當户對之類，也是其中的幾個重要修件。至於這個妻娶了來，是否能帮助丈夫從事生産，是否在經濟上能够自立，這一點，一般人却是不大注意的。</p>
<p>家裏多一個只知消費不事生産的『太太』，這在有錢的男子當然是不成問題的。不要說是一個，就是坐攤三妻四妾，也好比多買了幾套玩具，幾個模刑般的洋囡囡、總不至於會没有地方安置的罷。萬一妻妾們一旦『不安於位』，互相『火併』起來，也還有『遣散』之一法。只要鴻運常照，一切男地房屋資枯産業長在，幾十萬元的妻妾遣散費不過等於全部財産的滄少线粟，是毋庸勞心擔憂的。</p>
<p>然而，在中等階級以下的男子，對於這樣的『太太』却就委難應付了。本來，一個『從手到口』的人，或『從手還到不了口』的人，或甚至『有手而無從到口』的人，能娶得妻已經不是一件容易的事，有的或許還已經化了一筆小本錢。他們連自已個人生活都還維持不下，娶了妻還得像供奉菩蕯樣的奉養她，試問··這　樣，家庭經濟能不加速的日趨於破産嗎？</p>
<p>社會一天天的不景氣，一個没有經濟做後盾的人，本來就已被褫奪了娶妻的資格的，但假使他一定要冒個險，要嘗嘗怀的滋昧，免得過鹹肉莊的屠門而大嚼的話，那末，我以爲他最好是去務力追求一個職業婦女，追求一個能勤儉耐勞，能從事生産的女子，不必一定要年青美貌，也不必問她安竟是處女還是寡婦。當然，我所說的這樣的女子，不一定是指什麽『某某女校高材生』之類。我的意思是，好至少須有一技之長、，且能自食其力的，但如果她曾受過高等敎育，而同時在經濟上又確是能給丈夫以有力的帮助的，那自然是再好也没有了。這樣的妻子我無以名之，惟有名之曰『經濟妻』，因爲她昌和『經濟菜』一樣的價廉而物美。</p>
<p>不過，有一點我們要注意的，就是妻子和丈夫間的權利和義務是對等的。妻子固然應在物質上帮助丈夫，而丈夫也應該努力去分妻子之勞，不可存不勞而獲，坐享其成之想。因爲妻子畢竟不是摇錢樹，而丈夫也不是資本家，不能視她爲工銀勞動者而加以剥削壓榨的。無論妻子或丈夫應有這樣的認識，就是··家庭好比是一個小規模的合作社，而她和他都是這社裏的股東，彼此間都應該站在互助的意義上共同生産和共同消費的。</p>
<p>把小脚的妻子看作雕琢的藝術品，這時代現在是已經過去了。對戀愛讚爲神聖，對摩登妻子驚爲天神，或視爲美麗的花瓶，這種理想方義和唯美主義的觀點，現在也快要不適用了。在現在這個時代、妻子已漸漸地變爲實用品，一方面，社會需要她做推動社會前進的發動機，另一方面，丈夫也需要她做他的油，鹽，醬，醋，米，而社會對於她的丈夫也是這樣。</p>
<p>可是，話又說回來了。在捲入經濟恐慌漩渦，産業落後的中國目前情形之下，女子職業旣不發達，職業婦女爲數自極有限，是否每一個男子都能娶得職業婦女爲妻，以及是否每一個職業婦女都願意嫁給窮漢，確已成爲一個很大的肄問。加以失業恐慌日益加深，連男子都有許許多多的人找不到工作做，更何論女子？所以，卽使有些人能娶得職業婦女爲妻，但夫婦二人是否經常的都能有工作到手，也還是一個問題。再退一步說，卽使他們能有比較長期的職業，但所得的薪水或工資是否能解决他們最低限度的生活，這又是很難說的。這樣說來，『經濟妻』固然不易獲得，就使僥倖獲得了，結果恐怕仍然是不大經濟的罷。至若將來一旦有了小寳寳以後。則家庭間負累之重自然更是意料中事。無論你怎樣節制生育，這班『小抖亂』，這班小『不速之客』，有時或許還烛要闖</p>
<p>進來的。這好比吃了『經濟菜』，付了酒食費之後，有時還加付一筆小費一樣。</p>
<p>所以，一個男子若没有能国娶妻，或娶了妻深恐加重生活的負擔而無法應</p>
<p>付的話，那我還是希望他違反本能地抱獨身主義的好，否則，也只有照我上述的辦法，聊作萬一的補救而已。當然，假使你理想中的妻子是一個富家女，那自然是更好，但這要看你的環境如何，以及你是否具備有充分的條件足使好滿足，否則你休想獲得好！</p>
<p>最後一句話·『經濟妻』雖然不一辷能名符其實，但妓院裏的一公司大妻却也光顧不得，因爲那不但不很經濟，而且有點不合於衛生，那簡直是一種八寳妻罷了！</p>

<p>— 白壁</p>
<p>這一天，我到鎭做事的第一天。在吃早粥的時候，辦公室改了膳堂。膳堂外面透進一個頭來，是年近四十的中年婦人。</p>
<p>『先生，今天衣裳有換嗎？』『没有！没有！没有！』同事老張接連吐着厭惡的答覆。</p>
<p>『先生！讓我老太婆洗幾件吧，我不過年紀老些，洗衣裳終究是我洗得乾凈呀。一她還想挽回她的命運。</p>
<p>『没有！』老張拿着竹筷在敲桌子了　　失望了的好，一眼瞥見了我，又燃起了她新的希望。</p>
<p>『這位新來的先生，你有嗎？』</p>
<p>『没有，我前天剛換。』我老老實實的答覆。</p>
<p>『去！討厭的！嚕囌嚕什麽！就使我們有衣裳，也不會給你洗。』老張的面孔有些難看起來了。</p>
<p>我們吃了粥，那個中年婦人也走了　我正想問老張，老張却先鄭重其事的對我說·『老嚴，你以後換下來的衣裳，不要呌這個老太婆洗。此地還有一個年輕的，洗得好。她每天晚上總要到這裏來玩黃昏的。』</p>
<p>我報他一個微笑。晚上，辦公室改了夜談座。</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>門關着，高脚的煤油燈投射出橙黃的光。辦公桌上的文件，早安睡在抽屜裏。這時的桌上，是些橘子，花子，當然少不了茶和香烟。</p>
<p>同事們天南地北的在談天，我回憶着早上老張的話。</p>
<p>『正月裏，想我的郎，郎郎是新年。····』隠隠地有女人的口音在唱着春調，聲浪是由遠而近。</p>
<p>愈近了，似乎已在辦公室的門外。『騒貨來了！』感発　　的老張作着一個幽默的報告。</p>
<p>突然，辦公室的門，被推着、被推着，開了。一個二十一二歲的少婦、，出現于橙黃的燈光之中。３</p>
<p>『各位各先生，夜飯用過嗎？』一道眼波帶着媚笑向同事們身上溜了一轉。『吃過了，』不約而同的回音。寒喧過後，她一溜烟的就向寢室裏跑去，把各人的床舖翻着。老張緊跟着追進去。</p>
<p>『要衣裳好好兒要，不要亂翻！我』</p>
<p>被頭裏有着秘密。』聲音有些油滑。</p>
<p>『有什麽秘密。』</p>
<p>『我昨夜　　污，夢裏和你　　　　』啐！壞坯子，當心吃耳光。一聲音有些撒嬌。</p>
<p>『ＸＸＸＸＸＸ、』</p>
<p>『不要動手動脚。』</p>
<p>她從寢室裏回出來的時候，她手中抱了一大堆衣裳，足足有六七套。其中四套是老張的，其餘是另外兩個同事的。高高地疊在老張的辦公桌上。</p>
<p>或許是這天晚上有我這個陌生人在着的緣故，她在辦公室裏，没有裝出十分的媚態。</p>
<p>她把衣裳略略整理一下，夾在左臂間。就說聲『各位明朝會』，拉開門去了。</p>
<p>『正月裏，想我的朗，郎郎是新年。』聲音又在門外跳踎躍了。</p>
<p>老張似乎記起了一件什麽事情，也拉開門出去了。</p>
<p>這一夜，老張没有回來。</p>
<p>○○○</p>
<p>半個月後。</p>
<p>照例每天上午八點鐘要來嚕囌一番但結果仍是空手回去的那個中年婦人，突然絕跡来了，却來了一個　約模十四五歲的小姑娘。</p>
<p>『你們嫌我媽老，所以我媽今天特地呌我來，你們有換下的衣裳嗎？讓我帶幾套去洗。』</p>
<p>小小的眼睛，也懂得如何投射好的媚箭了。射着了老張，給她拿去了一條襯褲。</p>
<p>當我看到她回身的背影時，我迅速的聨想到好個『騒貨』。</p>
<p>『你媽太老，你太小。』老張又在下另有企圖的評語了。</p>
<p>我不禁憂慮到小姑娘寳貴的青春。</p>
<h3 id="c273">名人名言談蔣委員長的『作事條理』 <a href="#c273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— 昱</p>
<p>蔣委員長近親擬『作事條理』十六則，訓示僚屬遵守。其中除有幾條比較是適合於軍事方面，且不去說牠外，現在把餘下的幾則，加以個人的見　解，闡述如左··</p>
<p>一、『從大處着眼、從小處着手』—凡一事之成，每由小處努力而來，故做事應從小處着手。但當一面着手於小處的時候，一面又必不可忽略大處，才不致有顧小失大之弊。此所以作事要從大處着眼，從小處着手也。</p>
<p>二、『做事不要無責任心』—一個人作事最貴有責任心。右無責任心，則事之有始無終，自不待言；卽萬一成功，亦永屬僥倖。我國人做事，常不知責任所在。不惟對公理事如此，就是對私事亦然。故此條實爲每個人所宜遵守。</p>
<p>三、『知難行易』—此語爲孫中山先生所發明，和古人知易行難之理相反。我人作事，每知其應然，而不知其所以然。這便是知難行易之明證。不知亦能。行，我們凡事須守此一信念做去。</p>
<p>四，『說了就做，完再說』—言行一致，也是做事必須遵守的重要條件。許多人做事，大都是能說不能行，這是個大毛病。空口說大話，那一個不會？但只說了百没有去做，則說等於不說。故凡事須一說馬上就實行。待所說的做完了，然後再說另一種事。</p>
<p>八，『做事要有步驟，有條理』—做事一定要有計畫，有了計畫，然後才能一步一條的做去。不然茫無頭緖，緩急莫辨，先後倒置，事倍而功半矣。　　九，『做事不要敷衍塞責』—這就是因爲凡事没有責任心，故只想一味敷衍，以卸職責。我人做事，不做則已，一做便須負責做到底，千萬不可糊塗了事，以明責任所在。</p>
<p>十，『做事［祇要盡我的職責，不可諉過，更不可爭功』—常人作事，大都喜歡爭功諉過。一有過失，便百般推諉；不但不自悔誤，有時甚至還要牽累别人。若偶有所成就，則又誇能爭功。殊不知做事必須竭我心力做，有過則改，功成不居，才算偉大。</p>
<p>十一、『要找事做，不要等事做』—肯做事的，要找事做；不肯做事的，便只有等事做。但等事做者，一逢有事，也往往不且盡力。帮眞能做事者，須時時找事來做。</p>
<p>十二、『少說話，多做事』—此和第四條的意思差不多，敎人凡事要埋頭苦幹，不必多說空話。</p>
<p>十三、『做事不可好高務遠，見異思遷』—這是說，做事要從輕而易者着手，又必貴有恒心。若好高務遠，見異思遷，則作事鮮有成就者。　　十五、『做事要精明，要簡捷』—又處事精明，又要簡捷。但與其簡捷而潦草，則不若遲鈍而精明了。</p>
<h3 id="c274">梅英姑娘的手 <a href="#c274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— 亞賓</p>
<p>梅英是張師母們家裏的女傭，一個美麗活潑聰明可愛的姑娘。</p>
<p>據說梅英今年才滿十七歲，但她是長得那樣剛好的高了；好的胸部也突了王來，時常都在波動；她的臉兒總是紅紅的，好像剛剛開放的桃色；眼睛呢，透明，水汪汪的，轉動起來，好像一點清凉的水在一片嫩綠的荷葉上滾過樣，是那麽的明快；···總之，她是一個健康的美人，她已經發育完全了—　　不過，最使張師母滿意的，却是好那雙手，那雙肌肉豐富生得非常結實的手。眞的，梅英的一雙手，全像張師母自已的什麽東西樣，只要她高興，隨便要什麽，口一動，梅英的手便就给她拿來了。至於她家裏的一切日常事務，如燒飯，掃地，洗衣，給小小姐和四少爺穿衣服，····都不要她開口，梅英的那雙手總是給她做得好好的。</p>
<p>張師母家裏的人很多哩！張先生，張老太爺和老太太，麗眞大小姐，大少爺，四少爺（二少爺和三少爺據說是早死了），小小姐，還有張先生一個小少奶奶，連同張師母一共有九個人。傭工呢，只有梅英一個。所以這一大家人的一切日常事情乃至送小小姐和四少爺進學校，都落在梅英一人的身上。如果她是一個尋常的人，那是對付不了的。但還好，她的一雙手是太有用了。她從早上六點鐘起來，就開始掃地，打開水，燒粥，買小菜，洗衣，刷地板···所有這些，都全靠她一雙手。她很能靈活的運用它們，她甚至可以同時做兩樣工作，如一面燒飯，一面洗衣服，一面給小小姐和四少爺打毛線衣，一面又要爲張師母們　鷄墩肚子，····這除了她那雙特别靈活的手是不行的。</p>
<p>因此，張師母特别喜歡她，每月竟給了她五塊錢的工資（據說上海的女傭）</p>
<p>，大半都是每月三元或四元的工資），而且有時候甚至還例外地給她一些便宜，譬如把一月的申報紙她賣錢···等等。梅英當然也很高興，也很忠實地爲張師母們工作，她從來不發句怨言，總是笑盈盈的。每當張師母們的住在亭子間裏的房客何先生問她時；『梅英，你很忙？』她總是微笑着回答··『没有什麽！』同時那雙生得特别結實的手也不住地摇動着，好像是在表示··它們是很能聽我用的！</p>
<p>然而，冬平來了。經過幾番霜雪之後，梅英的那雙特别結實手，是一天一天地紅腫了起來。以後竟自龜裂了，出血了。但她却像是並没有感到什麽苦痛樣，依然很高興的工作着。一天，何先生向好說··</p>
<p>『梅英，你的手呀！』</p>
<p>『凍了啊·』</p>
<p>『買點凍瘡藥擦擦好了！』</p>
<p>『不，明年春天自然會好的呀！』</p>
<p>她依然是那樣高興。</p>
<p>但是，不管怎樣，梅英的手總不能像以前一樣的靈活地運用了。洗菜，掃地，特别是洗衣服，也不能做得很快了。於是張師母的不高興的神氣也就一天一天地增加起來，只要她看到梅英的手時，她便要恨恨地說··『哼，哼，看你』那鬼樣子啊！』</p>
<p>一天下午，正下着大雪，梅英提着一把大水壼，走到客堂去向張師母要兩個銅板來打熱水洗衣服。但不知怎的，張師母竟吝惜起兩個銅板來，她睜着火一般的大眼，向梅英叱道··</p>
<p>『刹體要打熱水，冷水不好洗嗎？』</p>
<p>『我的手凍了呀！』</p>
<p>『凍了！常常現在外面怎麽不凍？袖子那樣短！哼哼！』</p>
<p>『袖子長了不她做事呢！』但張師母却好像没有聽到似的，更刻毒地說··</p>
<p>『常常把手現在外面，買風騒！以爲你美，勾引人！』說着便衝到她寢室裏去了。</p>
<p>梅英突然睜大了眼睛，好像失了神樣的呆站着没有說出一句話來。經了好幾分鐘後，她才嗚嗚地哭了起來——這是她第一次的哭泣啊！</p>
<p>但張師母却在房裏說··『還要哭哩！不高興　嗎？下一月給我滾蛋！』</p>
<p>『袖··袖子····長了···不能做事啊····』這是梅英在哭泣中勉强說出的一句話。</p>

<h3 id="c275">蘇俄的煤油工業 <a href="#c275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— 葉華明</p>
<p>蘇俄的煤油工業，在石油的生産量，練油及運輸之間；在新的區域中增加生産量與牠的加速的發展之間；在増加生産量與增加提練天然油之間；還有些許的缺點。可是這些困難，並不能阻礙煤油出産的發達。蘇俄的煤油工業，是天天在發展着；到現在已佔有了世界煤油工業的第二個位置。</p>
<p>蘇俄煤油工業的發展是非常驚人的，因爲在以前舊俄時代煤油工業非常落後。第一次世界大戰，使巴庫—蘇俄最大出産煤油的區域—縮小了牠的市塲。在世界大戰中，煤油工業受到最大打擊的，是整個外高加索被他國的軍隊所强佔。</p>
<p>大戰終結時，蘇俄政府臨到了一個極艱難的工作。大部份的油田及煤油井都摧毁了，卽使有些没有被毁的，也都是處在荒凉的狀態中。這可於下面的事實證明之··卽在使一九一三年沙皇統治下，用舊的方法的生産量是九·一三百躉噸；可是在一九二○年到二一年，總的産量也祗有三·七八百萬噸！在這樣短促的時期中，用什麽方法來使煤油工業，不但恢復一九一三年的原狀而且還要大步的超過牠呢？</p>
<p>但在大戰結束後，煤油問題，便立刻被嚴重注意着，因爲國家正需要石油來發逹牠的工業及電力站。</p>
<p>在全蘇俄工人共同參與之下，煤油工業開始重新地建設來。大批的經費被指定作爲復興煤油工業之用。在一九二三年到一九二八年，兴共化去了六二八，○○○，○○○盧布··在第一個五年計劃中，共化去了一，四四○，○○○</p>
<h3 id="c276">時事研究提高銀價問題 <a href="#c276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— 一民</p>
<p>羅斯福上臺以後，爲要復興美國經濟，除實行統制經濟，通貨膨漲，抑低美金價格，購買黃金外，最近更將施行提高銀價的政策。此項消息傳來後，工商業家，銀行界，所有朝野的關心中國經濟的人們都非常注意，一時之間，議論紛紛，以致久已消沈的白銀問題，又復緊張器重起來了。</p>
<p>美國提高銀價之目的，主要的是在於發展遠東貿易，與英日勢力競爭。因爲遠東各地多半是通用白銀的，如果銀價高漲，則美國商品便易在遠東各地傾銷。</p>
<p>中匣在遠東是主要的銀本位國家，同時又是最大的入超國家，如果銀價提高了，則在表面上似乎可以增加中國之購買力，但實際上却是便利了美國商品的傾銷，把我們努力提倡的國貨市塲完全奪去。　　我們的民族工業，在帝國主義的摧殘之下，早已呈現出了破産的危機；其所以尙能苟延殘喘者，因在國内還相當地保持着一部分銷塲的緣故。倘若因銀價提高，此一部分之國内銷塲被美國商品奪去，則其前途眞是不堪設想了！　　同時，銀價高漲，美國商品在華傾銷，其結果，必將使我國的現銀大批流出。據中國銀行的報告，上海存銀的總數爲··現銀一萬四千二百四十八萬兩，現洋三萬三千六百七十八萬元，大條一萬五千八百十九條。這也並不是一個很大的數目字。如果在美國商品傾銷之下，隨着入超數字的昇高而使我們的存銀日益减少，則將使經濟不能周轉，甚至發生絕大的金融恐慌，招來整個社會的紊亂。—這是可以預料到的。</p>
<p>但在另一方面，因爲提高銀價，白銀的交易必行活躍，對於一般買辦，投機家，却是有利益的，同時，倘若銀價高漲，表面地增加了我國的購買力，實際地便利了美貨的傾銷，則在中國現銀流動中，必會增加我們的海關之收入。這也同樣是可以想到的。</p>
<p>提高銀價所可發生的這兩種現象。規定了我們的財政家，銀行界，工商業者對這問題的態度。在他們中，有的主張暫緩批准倫敦的白銀協定，禁止白銀出口或徵收白銀出口稅，以作爲對美國提高銀價之對策；有的則反之，謂倫敦的白銀協定應即批准，以顧全國際信用，並謂禁止白銀出口或徵收其出口稅，都是淺薄之見，提高銀價對我們是有利無害的。至於誰是對的，依我看來，則他們好像都有道理，但究竟他们是否都是站在民话和大衆的利益方面說話、那就很難說的了。</p>
<p>，○○○盧布。並且派遣了專門的工人團到美國，去研究煤油工業生産的最合理化的方法，購置機器，及求敎於外國的專門技師。</p>
<p>結果，整個煤油區域完全電氣化！在這方面，蘇俄是佔世界上第一個位置。遠在一九二三年，油田上的引擎等所用的煤油，差不多耗費生产總額百分之十二；而現在，一切工作都是利用電氣，煤油的耗費，減至不滿百分之一。</p>
<p>練油工程也是很發逹的。一九三三年，練油的容量，從九·三百萬噸増加到二三·二百萬噸。龐大的練油機與鐵架，在巴庫，伯塔，克克羅茲揑及其他煤油區域建築了。種大量鐵架的建設，很大的帮助了汽油生産額的增加。其他的石油出品，諸如圭瀝青，石腦油，以及各種機油的生産額也都増加着。</p>
<p>將石油及煤　油出品供給主要工業區的問題上、建造龐大的輸送管是非常必要的。一九三二年，在克羅茲揑與土布斯之間，在巴庫與伯塔之間，敷設了煤油輸送管—每個容量是一·五百萬噸。蘇俄最大的輸送管，從裏海一直到奥斯	克，將在本年開始輸送煤油。</p>
<p>因着煤油工業工人們工作的積極，第一個五年計劃中的煤油工業，在二年半的時期中就完成了；所以石油的生産額，是遠遠的超過了第一個五年計劃中所規定的數字了。在第一個五年計劃中，石油出品的出口，因了牠的工業的發達，使蘇俄獲得了六○○○，○○○，○○○盧布。煤油出口的增加，甚至超過了牠的生産額的增加。在一九一三年沙皇時代、出口了九四八，○○○噸；而蘇俄在一九三二年却逹到六，○一四，○○○噸—換句話說，就是較戰前增加了六倍。</p>
<p>在一九二一年蘇俄石油的出口數字是非常可憐的—只有三○，○○○噸。可過了四年，就有一，五○二，○○○噸。歐洲及地中海的國家所需的煤油，其中百分之二十是由蘇俄供給的。蘇俄的煤油出品、一直達到南菲洲，南美洲及新西蘭的市場。</p>
<p>蘇俄在近幾年來，用了很大的金錢，化在探覓石油地質上。探覓隊現已發現了新的油田；在中亞細亞，喬其亞，烏拉等地所發現的，是特别的廣大。恐怕不久，人，電氣，機器將要在這些地方出現了。</p>

<h3 id="c277">如何迎合頭客的心理 <a href="#c277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— 龍生</p>
<p>俗話説：「膏藥人人有賣，各人熬」</p>
<p>煉不同。」在這一句俗話内面，把一切商店競爭成敗的訣竅都透露出來了。往往同一地區售賣同一貨品的商店，爲什麽這家營業户限爲穿：那家却門可羅雀。這個原因，不外乎一則善於迎合顧客的心理：一則没有得到經營的訣竅。所以看店員應付顧客的手段，就可决定營業的盛衰。兹就經騐所及，把店員應付顧客應有的常識寫出幾項，作爲一班初出茅廬店員的借鏡。</p>
<p>（一）顯示貨品優點我記得有一次到</p>
<p>一家鐵器店内買一柄菜刀，該店店員拿出好幾種的菜刀，陳列着令我選擇。我當時躊躇不决，究竟不曉得那種菜刀最好。站在旁邊的另一個店員，看出了我遲疑的神氣，挿口説道：「先生—請你拿兩個銅板給我。」我在袋内搜了兩個銅板給他：他把兩個銅板堆在櫃檯上面，拿着菜刀，擦的一聲把兩個銅板都刴開了，我於是毫不遲疑的買了這種能刴開銅板的菜刀。這可見店員與其空言説貨品優良，不如實地表演出來，更加容易令人相信。又如糖菓店。先以糖菓給顧客，使嘗試其滋味：綢緞店把布展開披在顧客身上，使其自已審度，都是引動顧客高興購買的好法子。</p>
<p>（二）誘導顧客購買假如有一顧客，</p>
<p>原意祇想買一柄牙刷，店員可於買好牙刷之後，把牙粉香皂等物拿給顧客賞識。常有暫時本可不購買的東西，及因貨品入目，感覺其優美或價廉，不知不覺想要買起來了。又假如顧客携帶了子女，店員可相機把小孩所喜歡的東西，給小孩玩弄，若是有聲音的物品，更不妨響動起來，使得小孩不忍睾手。做父母的東抵愛子成性，看見子女心内歡喜的東西，多有不買也要買了的。</p>
<p>（三）貨品内容認識今以貨品出賣，</p>
<p>倘自已不知道其内容，那末，遇到了有經騐的顧客盤問起來，茫然不知所對，豈不是笑話麽？所以店員對於經售貨品的内容，先應有一番研究，如貨品的本質，製法，及其出産地點等，最好對於相類的貨品的情形，也都要明瞭一點，庶幾顧客有問，都能對答裕如。譬如顧客，要買一隻紅木檯子，但又嫌價高，店員可先將紅木優異之處，加以説明，然後把花梨木，香紅木之類，與之比較一番，顧客聽了，當然曉得紅木最好，不嫌其價高而願意購買了。</p>
<p>（四）態度方面注意我們到外人開設</p>
<p>的店内購買貨品，有時一様不買走了：在臨走的時候，店員多是和顏悦色，甚至表示深抱歉意的様子。可是本國人開的店内，情形就兩様了。我遇到過多少次商店，因爲貨品没有買成功，店員不僅表示不高興，而且肆意譏諷，謾駡，使你難堪，在這一點，足徴中外商人修養的程度，顯然有高低之分。下面列舉的幾點，店員都應時常自省犯了没有，如果犯了，就應該痛改。（一）先問顧客，要買價值若干的貨品：或是問顧客要買高價或低價的貨品，含有輕視顧客之意。（二）對於衣服檻樓的顧客，不立卽招待。（三）顧客詢問的事，不詳細回答。（四）顧客或有形貌上特異之點，任意取笑。（五）</p>
<p>衣服不整潔：手指汚穢。（六）互相交頭接耳，引起顧客猜疑。</p>

<h3 id="c278">峽門 <a href="#c278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— 熊丸</p>
<p>「，峽門到了！」茶房提高嗓子笑嘻嘻的喊着。</p>
<p>房艙和統艙的客人，都一齊往船頭下錨處擠。他們張大了眼睛。圓睜睜的黑眼珠不停的向各方面掃射，驚奇的，似乎找不到一個目標的様子。</p>
<p>山還是一起一代的　　　急的流水。</p>
<p>「那裏是峽門？」人叢中有人在自言自語的問着：</p>
<p>尖尖的船頭，衝破了水浪，乘勢的疾馳，白浪一陣陣的湧了起來，濺濕了船頭的甲板。前面的人，不知不覺的直往後退，風大聲嘯着。「峽門呢。」還没有影子。</p>
<p>嗚嗚！汽笛發狂的呌了起來，汹汹的水浪「和和」的和着，風更加大了，還帶來些小水點，冷冰冰的落在臉上。嘈雜聲漸漸的輕下來，形勢彷彿吃緊了，大家用手按着胸部，想制止心的怦跳。　　船，仍向前駛着：一様接連後退，但是正前面的水路，似乎没有了。遠遠迎頭站立的，是巍峨的大山，船似乎對凖那大山直駛。</p>
<p>「那不是白帝城嗎？茶房中一位提」着開水壺的高聲呌了。衆人的目光，雖然暫向那山腰上一座小小的紅色孤廟一瞥，又急忙收回，仍瞧着前面：似乎同想着一個間題：「船將怎様去呢？」水面愈狹了，水流愈急了，兩岸的山，像巨人伸腰似的，一座比一座峭些，船頭也漸漸向右擺了。</p>
<p>「啊！」大家忽明白似的脱口發出這</p>
<p>一聲來。水道原來是沿着大山向右轉的。江面更狹了，真驚人，直似小溪一様。用眼觀察，似乎僅能容一隻輪船通過。兩面的山，筆立的站起，像兵士敬禮的様子，伸直了腰，與水面成垂上。卽使有隻小船泊岸，也没有人能爬上岸。山上只有黄黑色的土：突出的大石：枯了的樹枝似的東西。雖然還是夏天，却尋不見一叢青草。風拚命的狂吼。人們石頭也似的呆立着，彷彿要看到這江面豁然開廣的地方，才舒服似的。光綫太黯淡了，要不是客廳裏的鐘告訴着只有三點一刻，大家會以爲天黑了。眞的，連青青的天空，也只剩一長條吊在頭上</p>

<p>斯魯。亨氏爲人頗與達氏相近。他講的是植物學，喜用晰之實證，與諸家之講義逈然有别：並且常帶學生到野外實習搜集，見稀有之植物或動物則加以講解。故當時達氏極佩其人。他們兩人竟成爲很好的朋友，達氏常至亭氏家晚餐，或二人作長途步行。當時學校中有稱達氏「是常與亨斯魯步行之人」。亭氏對於植物學，昆蟲學的知識甚富，並且精通化學，鑛物學，地質學。喜從微小觀察入手，在長期的觀察的繼續中，以窺測其變化，然後引爲結論。這種研究方法，後來給達氏不少影響。</p>
<p>達氏於一八三一年畢業於劊橋大學，得BA學位，是爲達氏學校生活的結束。無疑的，他的學問上的成就，當在以後自已的努力：尤在以下要特别提出的那比格爾的旅行一事。</p>
<p>「十一月四日這一天是怎様的一個光榮的日子呵？我的第二生命將從這一天開始，這一天將算是我以後種種譬如今日生的一様啊！」一八三一年十月達爾文獲得了经格爾旅行的機會，他被任命爲比格爾船的博物學家，以上的話就是他冩給比格爾船主費茨落的信。</p>
<p>自然，這次旅行對於達爾文以後的學問的成就是至關重要的。幼小時代所憧憬的熱帶諸國的周遊現在是實現了。</p>
<p>十二月二十七日，比格爾船離開了英國，開始了環遊世之途。此次航行的目的本在測量「智利」，「秘魯」海岸，以及太平洋諸島，然後復行世界一週，作繼續海岸綫的探測。所以經過的地方都要停留一些時間。於是，我們這位博物學家隨着到處的機緣，或馳驅於孤島，荒邱，或混身崦入蠻人的茅舍，或盪着小舟於茫茫大海之濱，或徒步攀登於熱帶的林野。他經過大沙漠，到過火島，住宿過珊瑚島巔，他對着熱帶廣漠的森林，不由得他不感到自已的渺小，宇宙的龐大，見了曫人的裸體不由得他不起懐古的幽思。他在旅行中，主要的工作自然是採集許多種的動植物，將它作粗略之解剖，並附以簡單之叙述。其中，尤以甲殻類之收集爲最完備。</p>
<p>這段旅行歷時五年零二月。在長途中，訓練了他聚精工作及集中注意：尤喚起了他對地質學的興趣。本來，他以前對地質學是認爲枯燥乏味的，現在完全改變了。「我在地質學中求得一種永久不懈的興趣，它對於世界創造了一種」</p>
<p>偉大的思想，也和天文學之於宇宙一様。一所以，當他發現聖雅各之地質時，竟樂不可支。可見學問的興趣在於實踐，只能由實踐中生長人的研究心，達爾文不慣聘地質講義，他的成功却是來自旅行，實踐的考察中。</p>
<p>這一旅行充分的提供了天才的研究資料，擴大了天才的眼界，養成了艱苦</p>
<p>的决心，把他的生活另轉入一個前進的階段去。</p>
<p>他於是不得不對聖經上的「創造工程」微笑了，同時他對於過去的自然科學</p>
<p>家也就不得不給與重新估定他的價值。</p>
<p>這段旅行畢，他出版了有名的「日記及註述」。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e11">Fu Zhan Kui Arrives in Linhe to Meet Sun Dianying; Two Telegrams Sent to Sun But No Reply Received; Jin-Sui Army Continues to Advance Westward <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Beiping: The authorities in Beiping currently only require Sun Dianying to comply with the order to leave the army. A peaceful resolution is still possible. Fu Zhan Kui, Zhang Xuanze, and Wang Zhongquan telegraphed the military, reporting that they departed from Hua on the 2nd and would arrive in Linhe on the 3rd. Because they did not know Sun's whereabouts, Li Ming first entered Ning territory to search for him. After meeting and agreeing on a meeting place, Fu and others will then proceed. The current first step is to meet with Sun, and only then can the issue of Sun leaving the army be discussed. If a satisfactory result is achieved, Bing Yue will depart from Sui with the qualification of a senior member of the Military Branch to handle the aftermath of Sun's army. Military steps are still being taken, and if a peaceful resolution is not possible, the matter will be resolved militarily. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: According to sources, the Jin-Sui army is advancing westward from Huangyangmutou. It is rumored that Zuo Yi will go to the front to direct operations within a few days. If Fu Zhan Kui's trip does not yield results, the troops of five provinces will encircle and suppress Sun's army. The foremost troops of Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai have also reached the corresponding locations. In northern Shaanxi, a certain unit has opened up and crossed into the territory of Gansu near Zhongwei. Sun's army is Yang Hou's bandit troop, and it is difficult for them to make progress because Hu Zongnan's unit is blocking them. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping, Guihua Telegraph: Fu Zhan Kui traveled from Sui to Baotou on the 3rd, stayed for a day, and then went to Linhe. The meeting place has not been determined and will be met by a car sent by Sun to Linhe. Before Fu and Sun meet, the Jin-Sui army will continue to advance. It is rumored that Zuo Yi has contacted Ma Hongkui. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: Fu Zhan Kui telegraphed Beiping on the 3rd, stating that he had arrived in Baotou and was now heading to Linhe. His future actions would be decided after agreeing on a meeting place with Sun. It is uncertain whether it will be in Dengkou. However, when Fu arrived in Sui, he sent two telegrams to Sun, but neither received a reply. All parties have always been reluctant to believe Sun's expression of leaving the army, so military actions have not been suspended. If Fu's trip yields no results, encirclement and suppression will commence immediately. The vanguard of the Jin-Sui army continues to advance from Huangyangmutou and has reached the corresponding location. A certain unit of the Central Army will also be dispatched to the front to assist. The troops stationed in Gansu and Qinghai have been mobilized and are now concentrated near the Ning Yuan, and the suppression of Sun's army has been completely arranged. If Sun insists on acting recklessly, it will not be difficult to annihilate him in one fell swoop. Reports that Sun's army once invaded Ningxia a month ago and that Yu Shiming's rebellious troops bypassed northern Ningxia and sneaked into Zhongwei are not true. (3rd Central Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing, Ningxia Telegram to the capital: On the 2nd, at Chou hour, Sun Kuiyuan led the newly arrived 119th Division of Xie Putian, the artillery battalion, and the special service battalion to attack the positions near Baliqiao, north of Ningxia City.

Many prisoners were captured. The enemy in Pingluo, after being repeatedly attacked by Ma's Brigade, which defended the city of the 15th Route Army, is now hiding in villages outside the city and has no combat capability.

<h3 id="e15">The Road to Rural Economic Regeneration: Be Cautious <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Establishing Rural Credit Cooperatives: In the year 1933 of the Republic of China, the total value of food products such as rice, wheat, flour, and miscellaneous grains imported by our country was 274,330,003 yuan, ranking first in the total amount of imports, accounting for one-fifth of the total, and compared with the total export value, it was almost half. We are deeply alarmed and fear the difficulties of the future and the hardships of the coming days, and we cannot but plan for remedies. Our country is not like England, which is based on industrial foundations and has huge overseas investments. Although the country's food supply depends on imports and imports exceed exports every year, it is not difficult to achieve a balance of international payments, and the foundation of the national economy can remain stable as before. However, our country is still stagnating in agricultural economics, yearning for the ideal of self-sufficiency without any progress. Five years ago, there were already signs of rural decline and economic crisis, but the reason why it was able to barely support and fill the shortage of import surpluses was because it relied on overseas remittances from overseas Chinese, secret exports, and partial trade surpluses from the three northeastern provinces. Recently, the world economic panic has affected the remittances from overseas Chinese, which have gradually decreased, and cash and other secret exports have also felt the same depletion. Since the loss of the four northeastern provinces, the impact on the economy has become more significant. From the import of such a large amount of food products, we can infer the general situation of our country, that is, most of the rice and grain in important cities along the Yangtze River and the coast depend on overseas imports, and the foundation of the so-called agricultural country has long been shaken. At the same time, the畸形的 development of cities has made the countryside more difficult, and the decline of our entire national economy is very serious. Since exports and imports cannot offset each other, and there are no other secret exports to fill the gap, how can it cope with the danger of this economic exploitation situation? As for the current situation in the countryside, although there have been many bumper harvests in recent years, the villages are all complaining about the surplus of grain, and transportation is very difficult. In addition, the heavy taxes and levies and restrictions on the export of grain have created a situation where cheap grain hurts farmers. The turnover of the rural economy is becoming more and more inflexible, so how can the urban market not decline day by day?</p>
<p>Since the domestic situation is like this, it is unrealistic to directly prosper cities, or to make industry develop upward, or to make commerce immediately revive. Even if there are some special political and economic forces that can stimulate cities to continue to prosper and forcibly maintain the status quo, they are not long-term solutions and cannot resist the dumping policies of other countries. Therefore, the short-term solution is to start with the turnover of the rural economy. What the countryside is eager for and what the people need most is nothing else, first of all, a solid and stable order, and a relative reduction of taxes and levies. If this can be achieved, then with the inherent ability of our country's farmers to endure hardship and hardship, it may not be difficult to find a way to regenerate themselves. However, after several periods of upheaval and the extension of the national crisis, the stability of order alone is still limited to the negative aspects, and it is not enough to restore the prosperity of cities. Therefore, at a minimum, the turnover of the rural economy should be made flexible, and farmers should have surplus funds to cultivate their production, so that they have the purchasing power for urban industrial products, and the future of the national economy will have the hope of recovery. What is the method? It is to implement and promote rural credit cooperation.</p>
<p>The current rural loans are not widespread, and the procedures are complicated. In fact, the effect is limited to the local area, and the difficult problems of the entire countryside remain the same. In order to make rural loans popular and make the economic turnover lively, it is better for the provincial government to supervise the counties to establish rural cooperatives. The capital is planned by the county government for one-third or one-half, and the rest is contacted by the central government with the financial community in large cities such as Shanghai and Tianjin, or public bonds are issued as the circulating funds of the credit cooperatives. The restrictions on the loan should not be too strict, as long as there is a fairly reliable guarantee, it can be repaid. The repayment period should be slightly longer - the shortest should be eight or nine months to suit the harvest season of farmers. As for the interest rate, it may be slightly lower, with a monthly interest rate of one point as the highest rate. As for the export of agricultural products, the credit cooperatives can also handle it on behalf of the farmers to facilitate direct transportation, and the general market price will not be manipulated by tycoons. If it is promoted step by step from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces, then the regeneration of the countryside may have a glimmer of hope.</p>

<p>Nanjing: Legislative member Chen Changheng expressed his views on the White Silver Agreement, saying that there are two points that need attention: one is that China shall not abolish old silver coins in Article 4 of the agreement, and the other is to what extent the silver price is stabilized. Therefore, when the Legislative Yuan reviews the agreement, it is best to attach two conditions: one is that although China has an obligation to comply with the provisions of Article 4 of the agreement and cannot abolish silver coins, it cannot be bound by this in special economic circumstances that cause the livelihood of the Chinese people to be uneasy; second, to what extent the silver price is stabilized must be clearly stated so that there is a limit when the silver price rises and falls.

<h3 id="e21">A Glimpse into the Military Deployment of Soviet Russia in the Far East <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>A foreign military expert in Nanjing has investigated the Soviet Russian deployment in the Far East.  Soviet Russia currently has 470,000 regular troops, 600,000 national guards, and approximately 240,000 political police and militia, totaling 1.3 million Red Army personnel.  They are divided into 76 infantry divisions and 31 cavalry divisions. All weapons and armaments are of the latest type. In addition, there are mechanical and chemical units, approximately 2,000 tanks, and 2,000 military aircraft. Since Japan seized the Northeast by force, Soviet Russia, to prevent Japanese aggression, has deployed forces in Siberia, with deployments in three zones. The first zone is the Primorsky Krai and Ussuri region, centered on Vladivostok, Nikolsk-Ussuriysk, and Khabarovsk, deploying four infantry divisions and two cavalry divisions. Several air force squadrons are stationed in Khabarovsk. Posyet Bay, due to its proximity to the Korean border, is having a fort designed and built by German engineers. A large air force detachment is also stationed in Vladivostok, with several submarines anchored offshore. The local air force has 2,000 large aircraft, each capable of carrying several tons and flying 2,500 kilometers. As Vladivostok is not far from Japan, the Vladivostok fortress has been reinforced and all equipment is extremely modernized. The coastal defense works are not only intended for defense but also capable of offensive action. The Vladivostok shipyard is working day and night to accelerate production, but the content is difficult to detect. The second zone is the Muravyov-Amursky region, centered on Blagoveshchensk, with approximately three infantry divisions stationed there. The third zone is the Zabaykalsky region, centered on Chita, Verkhneudinsk, and Irkutsk, with three infantry divisions and at least one cavalry division stationed there. There is also an air force squadron in Chita. It is estimated that the Soviet Russian infantry strength in the Far East has doubled compared to peacetime, and the cavalry has increased two to three times. The purpose is purely to counter Japan. Japan already has 110,000 troops in northern and southern Manchuria (including reservists) and is building fortifications on the western border, opening about ten airfields, and stationing 300 to 500 aircraft for busy daily training.

<p>The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Discusses Relief Measures. Nanjing. Tan Kah Kee's rubber factory in British Singapore has closed down, leaving more than six thousand Chinese workers unemployed. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission attaches great importance to this. At its 64th regular meeting on the 3rd, the commission discussed relief measures. As a result, an urgent telegram was sent to the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce, in conjunction with Consul-General 刁 (surname, name not known), to negotiate relief measures nearby. It is known that Tan Kah Kee's rubber factory has a capital of over 10 million yuan, and monthly business is around 5 million yuan. The factory's rubber shoes sell about 4 million pairs to the UK each year, over 300,000 pairs to New Zealand, and even more to East Asia. The reason for the failure was the pressure from British banking groups, as the group designated purchases from factories run by British people, hence the bankruptcy declaration. The factory has debts of around 10 million yuan, and the Singapore Chamber of Commerce may not have a way to save it. (Special dispatch from March 3rd)</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission in Nanjing held a regular meeting on the 3rd, chaired by Chen Shuren, to discuss important cases: (1) A letter from Commissioner Zhou Xianrui regarding the closure of Tan Kah Kee's rubber factory in Singapore, leaving Chinese workers unemployed, requesting assistance.

<h3 id="e29">Sichuan Imposes Parcel Tax, Ministry of Transportation Submits a Request for Strict Prohibition <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing. The Ministry of Transportation submitted a request to the Executive Yuan, asking for strict prohibition of the collection of parcel tax rates by local tax authorities in Sichuan in order to maintain postal services and emphasize government orders. The original text is as follows: According to a report from the Directorate General of Posts, the East Sichuan Management Bureau reported that, according to an order from the 21st Army Headquarters, tax authorities in various parts of Sichuan, except for the Chongqing, Wanxian, Luzhou, Xuyong, and Hejiang bureaus, have re-established the parcel tax rate, in addition to the original 2.5%, uniformly adding a consolidated tax of 4%, totaling 6.5%, which has been implemented since November 20. However, other ordinary commercial goods are not subject to such additional taxation. Merchants have repeatedly petitioned, but appeals to the army headquarters have been ineffective. It is found that the collection of parcel tax in Sichuan has been repeatedly submitted to the government for strict prohibition, but not only has it not been effective, but it has also become more severe, with the postal tax being 40% higher than ordinary commercial transportation. According to the army headquarters' unauthorized order to its subordinate tax authorities, "the consolidated tax on parcel items is still low, and merchants are taking advantage of loopholes, resulting in a decrease in the headquarters' tax revenue," hence the re-establishment of the additional tax. The intention is no less than to disrupt postal services. Previously, according to a petition from Liu Boqiong and others of the Leshan County Parcel Petition Group, which was forwarded on January 31, the current situation not only involves additional taxation in Leshan County, but also extends to the entire province. They dare to blatantly violate laws and regulations, and they discriminate against parcels alone. The impact will inevitably lead to the cessation of postal parcels, which is no small matter. A copy of the original report and attachments are submitted to the Executive Yuan for review. (Special dispatch from March 3rd)</p>

<p>Willing to Give Up U.S. Army Bases in the Philippines</p>
<p>The Issue of Naval Bases Will Be Decided in the Future</p>
<p>Requests the Establishment of Commercial Treaty Privileges</p>
<p>Explains the Decline of American Foreign Trade</p>
<p>Should Quickly Adjust Tariffs to Cope Washington President Roosevelt today sent two special messages to Congress.</p>
<p>The First Message</p>
<p>Advocates that the Philippine Independence Act previously proposed by Senators Hawes and Cutting be resubmitted, with an amendment that the United States give up its U.S. Army bases in the Philippines after the island's independence. It is found that this case was passed by Congress a year ago, but it naturally became invalid this year because the Philippine government did not accept it. The original plan stipulated that the Philippines would be independent within 12 to 14 years and could still maintain its army and navy bases in the Philippines. Now President Roosevelt is willing to give up army bases, while for navy bases, President Roosevelt advocates that they will be resolved in the future according to methods that can satisfy both parties. President Roosevelt claimed that he did not believe that other articles in the original plan needed to be amended. He was sure that any imperfections and inequalities could be corrected after appropriate complaints without harming both parties. President Roosevelt also said, "What I want to declare is that we firmly desire to complete the independence of the Philippines at the earliest appropriate time, but to complete its independence without sufficient time to seek the necessary adjustments in politics and economy is to directly treat the people of the Philippines with injustice, which is little different from refusing independence. At this time, changing the economic provisions of the original plan only makes us be despised by others. Our country does not covet other people's land, nor does it want to violate the wishes of the people who acquired their sovereignty by war and restrain them. " This case has been immediately submitted to the House of Representatives. The committee will begin its review on Monday. (Reuters dispatch from the 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e61">Naval Base to Be Moved to Tianjin, Honolulu if Necessary <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt today announced his second message. Regarding the Philippine Independence Act, the proposals of former senators Hawes and Cutting will be extended. He is determined to abolish the army bases in the Philippines and plans to gradually shrink the naval bases in the future or, if deemed necessary, move them to places such as Tianjin, China, and Honolulu. Because the above two points are the two major reasons why Philippine senators are most opposed to them in Congress, the President is determined to abolish them. As for all commercial treaties and preferential immigration, etc., they are all under considerable consideration. (National Telegraph, 2nd)</p>
<p>Second Message</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt today sent his second message to Congress, requesting special privileges to revise tariffs during negotiations with other countries to seek the welfare of American agriculture and industry. President Roosevelt stated in his message the state of the sluggish world trade, saying that since 1929, world trade has decreased to about 70 percent, and American foreign trade has decreased even more, to 52 percent, resulting in worker unemployment, machine shutdowns, idle ships, farm bankruptcies, and the government finds it increasingly difficult to formulate economic reorganization methods. Other governments have gained much in international trade through negotiating mutual trade agreements. If American agriculture and industry are to maintain their position, the government must be able to quickly and decisively negotiate and exchange benefits with various countries. President Roosevelt continued by saying that any country must always be in a position to quickly adjust its national taxes and tariffs to cope with sudden changes, so as to avoid major fluctuations in imports and exports. If the United States is not in a position to adapt to changing circumstances, its trade will inevitably be seized by others. If the United States is not in a position to quickly revise the conditions on which its trade with other countries is based, it cannot properly protect its trade from discrimination by other countries or contracts that harm its interests. However, President Roosevelt also earnestly stated that the effect cannot be achieved overnight. To create trade that does not harm American producers, it depends on a plan of prudence and gradual development, so that American products can be given a better position by other countries than before. President Roosevelt did not mention the extent of the tariff changes. Many believe that President Roosevelt can get the support of the Democratic Party, but the Republican Party will definitely oppose it. It is expected that Congress will eventually pass the necessary legislation, so that the President can soon begin consultations with major exporting countries. (Reuters Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>New York - According to a Washington dispatch today, President Roosevelt's request for authorization to negotiate commercial treaties and revise tariffs will encounter fierce and prolonged opposition. Although President Roosevelt stated that he only needs this power for three years, some Democrats have also expressed concerns about this. Democratic Senator Walsh said that it is inconceivable to grant this power to the President except for temporary emergency measures. Republican Senator Borah also issued a warning, saying that if Congress does not have the courage to reject it, then the tariff dictatorship may be imposed forever. (Reuters Telegram, 3rd)</p>

<p>Osumi Explains Second Supplementary Plan: U.S.-Japan Ratio to Be 18 After Completion</p>
<p>Tokyo - Yesterday morning, the House of Peers Budget Fourth Subcommittee held a meeting. Naval Minister Osumi explained the content of the Second Supplementary Plan.</p>
<p>Tani Son'yu asked: "It is heard that the United States has a plan to build 120 warships. How is Japan preparing for this?"</p>
<p>Naval Minister Osumi explained the content of the 120 warships, saying that by 1935, the United States' warships will reach the full amount stipulated by the treaty.</p>
<p>Tani asked: "What is the government's attitude towards the Geneva Disarmament Conference? Also, what is the attitude towards general disarmament conferences?"</p>
<p>Naval Minister Osumi replied: "Japan intends to submit a concrete proposal at the Geneva Disarmament Conference, with the aim of reducing the tonnage and holdings of warships. There are also proposals to abolish aircraft carriers. The attitude towards the next disarmament conference is still under study."</p>
<p>Tani asked: "Can the Second Supplementary Plan strengthen national defense? What will be the ratio between Japan and the United States when the plan is completed?"</p>
<p>Naval Minister Osumi replied: "The completion of the Second Supplementary Plan will generally achieve the goal of national defense security. The ratio between Japan and the United States is 82 percent when compared in terms of ship age."</p>
<p>Tani asked: "The First Supplementary Plan has not been fully implemented, but today there is already a Second Plan. Does the military industry have sufficient digestion capacity?"</p>
<p>Naval Minister Osumi replied: "There is hope for complete implementation." Tani also asked various questions regarding the different unit prices of the First Supplementary Plan and the Second Plan. (Nichi-Ren Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The House of Peers continued to hold the Fourth Subcommittee of the Budget Committee on the 3rd to discuss the naval ratio issue.</p>
<p>Sakamoto Toshiatsu asked: "According to the Naval Minister, the Japanese Navy is not satisfied with the previous ratio, but the United States still insists on the previous ratio. How can this be reconciled?"</p>
<p>Naval Minister Osumi replied: "The naval authorities are studying concrete proposals based on the security of national defense."</p>
<p>Sakamoto asked: "What if negotiations are conducted based on the principle of equality of national defense rights, not based on numbers?"</p>
<p>Naval Minister Osumi replied: "This issue is also under consideration."</p>
<p>Prince Sanetaka Ichijo asked: "It is unavoidable for the Navy Ministry to request the necessary expenses for national defense, but huge budgets should not be used indiscriminately."</p>
<p>Naval Minister Osumi replied: "The authorities are working hard to save unnecessary expenses." (Nichi-Ren Telegram, 3rd)</p>

<p>Dissatisfaction with the British Disarmament Plan, Liaison with Other Countries to Monitor the Austrian Situation</p>
<p>Paris - The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies had raised questions to the government regarding foreign affairs on Wednesday. Today, Foreign Minister Barthou attended the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies and answered each of the questions raised.</p>
<p>(A) Regarding the war debt issue, the Foreign Minister said that the government has not yet taken any resolution measures.</p>
<p>(B) The Foreign Minister also explained the situation of German Chancellor Hitler's party promoting itself in various countries around the world. Member Ferrand asked about the situation in Austria. The Foreign Minister replied that France's policy towards Austria has always been in line with the policies of the Little Entente countries, Poland, Britain, and Italy. The attitude of France's decision can be analyzed as follows: (1) The independence of Austria must be maintained in respect of the peace treaty. (2) Germany wants to regard the Austrian incident as an internal problem, while France believes that it should be resolved internationally, so it advocates that countries should take a cooperative policy on this matter. (3) France opposes the restoration of the Habsburg royal family. This is the same opinion as Britain, the Little Entente countries, and the Balkan countries. France's will on the above three items is firm, more so than at any time.</p>
<p>(C) Regarding the talks of British Lord Privy Seal Eden, the Foreign Minister said that the French authorities had explained to Eden their concerns about military groups other than the formal German army, and told him that the British disarmament plan's lack of a set disarmament test period was a shortcoming. If this plan is implemented, the result will be that France disarms, while Germany rebuilds its armaments. From the first year of implementation, Germany's military strength, such as artillery positions and tanks, will exceed that of France, and when faced with the threat of aggression, there are no other sanctions besides mutual consultation between countries, which feels insufficiently guaranteed. Foreign Minister Barthou praised Eden, saying that he is a good friend of France, and also said that he had told Eden that German rearmament is also dangerous to Britain because Germany demands the establishment of fighter planes, the amount of which should be 50 percent of the French Air Force. In addition, Germany also retains commercial aircraft, and it is easy to convert commercial aircraft into bombers. If Germany gets its wish, then the German air force will have an advantage. The Foreign Minister's statement created a good impression in the Foreign Affairs Committee. (Havas Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e66">French Defense Committee Studies Reply to Britain <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Reported Three Solutions</p>
<p>Paris - According to reports, the Defense Council will study the following solutions to the disarmament issue and then reply to the British proposal, namely (1) Germany retains its current military equipment status suitable for the Versailles Treaty, and other powers implement disarmament based on certain guarantees; (2) Conclude a treaty stipulating that the military equipment of other powers should remain at its current level, and allow Germany to re-equip its armaments to a certain limit, subject to international supervision; (3) Complete freedom of action for each country. Informed sources now believe that the Defense Council will find it extremely difficult to make a decision on these three resolutions, because from France's perspective, they have both advantages and disadvantages. (National Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>Paris - The European situation has now been suddenly attacked by an unstable force, because according to today's news, France is dissatisfied with the British disarmament plan. When French Foreign Minister Barthou answered the questions raised by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies yesterday, he expressed the attitude of the French government, saying that France intends to reject the British plan because it does not include a test period. From the perspective of the French government, this omission will allow France to implement disarmament, while Germany will rebuild its armaments. If the British plan is accepted, then Germany's artillery teams and tanks will be superior to France in the first year. There is no guarantee of sanctions in the British plan, and the prescribed consultation will be of no help. The French Cabinet decided to reject German Chancellor Hitler's request to rebuild armaments. If Germany must rebuild its armaments, it must abide by the restrictions proposed by France. If a compromise can be reached, France must also ask Britain to guarantee that Britain will defend France if Germany violates the conditions.</p>
<p>At the same time, Reuters Washington correspondent telegraphed that, according to the record of the conversation between US Undersecretary of State Phillips and British Ambassador Lindsay, the US government's opinion on disarmament is indeed consistent with that of Britain. Phillips told the British Ambassador that the United States expressed sympathy for the British proposal and hoped that they could resume general disarmament discussions and succeed.</p>
<p>Phillips also quoted President Roosevelt's words, namely that the United States is very concerned about the success of the world disarmament plan and is willing to provide possible assistance to other countries to achieve a feasible plan.</p>
<p>It is heard that Mr. David Davies, who is currently in London, is traveling to Europe for private affairs this time and will not formally discuss disarmament with any foreign government, but will hold informal consultations with British Lord Privy Seal Eden and other European experts.

<p>There Is a Trend Towards Turning to the Italian Plan</p>
<p>London - Lord Privy Seal Eden met with Foreign Secretary Simon and Privy Councillor Baldwin one after another today. According to political figures, Eden gave Simon and Baldwin a detailed report on the opinions of the governments of various countries in continental Europe on the British disarmament plan. Certain political figures who do not need to remain silent because of their position have analyzed and explained the current situation of this issue and its future prospects as follows: That is, the British side believes that Germany's aviation demands are enough to threaten Britain, and the French side is quite uneasy about military groups other than the formal German army. Although the points that Britain and France pay attention to are different, their opposition to Germany's demands is clearly the same. However, British people are unwilling to make other promises regarding sanctions for violating the disarmament convention. The general public believes that this decision cannot satisfy French public opinion. The majority of British public opinion believes that because the situation is so complicated, the Italian disarmament plan cannot be abandoned suddenly, but there is one condition, that is, the Italian plan only temporarily stabilizes the situation, and when there is a good opportunity, it should be renegotiated. We should pay attention to the fact that although this change of intention has been expressed by public opinion, there is still no trace of it in the declarations of responsible parties as of today.

<p>Simon Also Prepares to Respond</p>
<p>London - The Liberal Party Full or Nothing Club is scheduled to hold a political banquet on the 14th of this month. Foreign Secretary Simon will attend at that time. Since the establishment of the coalition cabinet, it will be the first time that the Foreign Secretary has attended the club. Congressional figures were quite surprised to hear the news. The Liberal Party National Club is the stronghold of the British Liberal Party. All those who inherit Gladstone's thoughts belong to it in principle, but its active members are mainly Sir Samuel and others. Sir Samuel previously served as Minister of the Interior in the coalition cabinet. After the Ottawa Imperial Economic Conference in 1932, three members of Sir Samuel's faction resigned together because they disagreed with the Conservative Party. The grand coalition of the Conservative Party, the Liberal Party, and the Labour Party was broken. Now, Sir Samuel's faction has joined the opposition party. Under these circumstances, the general public believes that the recent Conservative Party has been granted an important position and is attacking Simon, so the Foreign Secretary has decided to respond. However, the Foreign Secretary only wants to show the importance of Liberal Party public opinion, which cannot be ignored in elections and politics, and to inform Prime Minister MacDonald and the Conservative Party leader. His intention is probably not necessarily to prepare to withdraw from the cabinet. (Havas Telegram, 2nd)</p>

<p>Prohibition of Imports of Goods Made by Forced Labor Feels Administratively Difficult</p>
<p>Private Bill Ultimately Not Established</p>
<p>London - The House of Commons today discussed a private member's bill dealing with imported goods. The bill aims to authorize the government to reject imports of goods made by forced labor. Conservative MP Williams asked the government to pay attention to the dangerous competition of manufactured goods exported from tropical countries, and especially to rubber shoes shipped from Malaya and Hong Kong, as their numbers have recently increased significantly. In addition, India is the most important supplier of steel that Britain needs and should be protected from competition. Conservative MP Lycett said that Britain recently ordered 100,000 pairs of shoes from Bata in India, and there are also 60,000 pairs of rubber shoes shipped from Hong Kong. Several Conservative MPs from the opposition party supported the bill. Overseas Trade Minister Colville replied that the government expressed sympathy for the bill, but it was administratively difficult to establish it. If the most-favored-nation treatment agreement is greatly reduced, it will inevitably cause major commercial disturbances and increase the number of unemployed people. The bill was ultimately not established. (Reuters Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e74">Since the Devaluation of the Dollar, European Cash Has Flowed to the United States <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>American Financial Circles Are Skeptical About the Silver Issue</p>
<p>London - Financial circles here issued a message saying that since the devaluation of the dollar, a large amount of cash has flowed out of European central banks in gold, the amount of which is quite alarming. However, because the dollar has depreciated too much, countries have no profit to be made, so cash is no longer flowing out. In total, since President Roosevelt's new monetary policy was implemented, the central banks of France, the Netherlands, and Switzerland have lost a total of about 325 million yuan in cash reserves, of which France accounted for 188 million yuan, the Netherlands accounted for 85 million yuan, and Switzerland lost about 22 million yuan. (National Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>Washington - Major political and financial figures here are quite skeptical about the silver issue. The Treasury Department plans to wait and see what happens after the gold proposal is implemented before resolving the silver issue, so it may not be discussed in time in this Congress.

<p>Russian Newspapers Denounce the Japanese for Slandering and Spreading Rumors</p>
<p>Moscow - The Japanese Asahi Shimbun claims that "a certain organization" has learned that the Soviet Union is increasing its troops in Mongolia, which has now reached 30,000 people, so the Japanese army has to pay extra attention to such things. Izvestia commented on this, saying that this news made up by "a certain organization" is unparalleled in provocative lying. Since the Japanese army has occupied all of Manchuria and more than half of Inner Mongolia, the Japanese army must now pay extra attention to the situation in the Mongolian People's Republic (i.e., the Outer Mongolia Republic). The Asahi Shimbun will undoubtedly tell the world that there are at least 100,000 Soviet troops in the Mongolian People's Republic. The undeniable and well-known fact that there are absolutely no foreign soldiers in the Mongolian People's Republic is more than enough to break the nonsense of Tokyo's rumor-mongers and those who slander the Soviet Union. The emergence of the news published by the Asahi Shimbun is not only in ardent imagination, but also because some Japanese are ardently trying to not be satisfied with interfering in Inner Mongolia, but also want to interfere in Outer Mongolia. Therefore, this is also a new and clear evidence of preparing and developing such annexation adventure plans. (TASS Telegram, 3rd)</p>

<p>The securities market opened steadily and fluctuated, with limited gains, but people are optimistic because there is good industrial news and it is expected that steel production capacity will soon recover to 50 percent. After the opening, the market tended to be quiet, but the upward trend unfolded because people's fears about the Securities Exchange Management Act seemed to gradually subside, and the market's actual position had improved after the recent setbacks.</p>
<p>The cotton market opened quite actively, and people were optimistic. Traders, Japanese businessmen, banks, and speculators were all buying, and short sellers were also covering. At the same time, there was also the development of the Penhaidar proposal and tariffs, so there was a fierce upward trend, but soon local profit-takers rose up, causing the market to tend to loosen.</p>
<p>The silver market opened steadily. Because the situation in other markets was good, the atmosphere in the silver market was also optimistic. The news that Congressman Hess and others would propose a silver bill in the House of Representatives on Sunday did not have any impact on the silver market, so the silver market ultimately had no exciting performance this morning.</p>
<p>The rubber market was sluggish, but people's spirits were still stable because the securities market had improved.</p>
<p>London Special Dispatch: The Financial Times' New York dispatch said that the New York banking community believes that tariff adjustments that are intended to cause no harm to others will also bring no benefit to others, because without increasing imports, exports cannot be increased. It is heard that the authorities have prepared a tariff list in preparation for Congress's needs. In practical terms, tariffs can be reduced without adverse effects on goods and raw materials whose domestic production is lower than demand, or unfinished goods. If the tariff is reduced, then the selling price of these goods will inevitably be lower, which is also not what the authorities want.</p>

<p>Fascist Faction Will Further Investigate the Iron Minister</p>
<p>Tokyo, this afternoon, the government held an extraordinary cabinet meeting in the Lower House. Minister of Education Hatoyama formally submitted his resignation. The reason for his resignation, he stated, was that a cultural and educational flaw had been left, so he resigned to take responsibility. Prime Minister Saito immediately discussed with the cabinet members, and as a result, Minister of Education Hatoyama's resignation was approved alone, and the Prime Minister temporarily took over. (3rd, China League Electric)</p>
<p>Tokyo, Prime Minister entered the palace at 3:00 PM today, presented the Minister of Education's resignation, and immediately held the inaugural ceremony for the Prime Minister to concurrently serve as the Minister of Education, with the Iron Minister Saneto standing by. (3rd, Dentsu Electric)</p>
<p>Tokyo, at 5:00 PM this afternoon, former Minister of Education Hatoyama issued the following statement of resignation when the dismissal order was announced: "This time, regarding my actions, there has been discussion and the world has been in turmoil, which is very regrettable. The incident that became a problem is completely unfounded. It is hereby declared that if decisions on whether to stay or leave are made due to slander and false accusations, it would be very harmful to public morals and people's hearts. Therefore, I look back on this issue and deal with it with detachment, believing that it is a service to society.</p>
<p>The sacred educational community must always be as bright and clean as a mirror. Who can tolerate clouding it? There will inevitably be a time for resolution in the future, but I deeply feel the fact that it has been clouded, and I must quickly remove the responsibility. Therefore, from a broad perspective, I retire cleanly to renew the influence of the educational community, and think about the way of mutual love among compatriots. With a mind as clear as a mirror and still water, I humbly ask for a graceful retirement." (The following is omitted)</p>

<p>Tokyo, the Japanese Minister of Education is temporarily held concurrently by the Prime Minister. However, Hatoyama represents the Seiyukai party in the cabinet and cannot be compared with Foreign Minister Uchida and Commerce Minister Nakajima. The Seiyukai party expects Prime Minister Saito to consult with President Suzuki in the near future regarding a successor to the Minister of Education. Due to the current political situation, which is still unfavorable to political parties, the Seiyukai intends to recommend its successor to temporarily extend the life of the Saito cabinet. However, the National League and the Araki-affiliated members of the Upper House intend to further pursue the Iron Minister Saneto, and the future of the Saito cabinet is still difficult to be optimistic about.

<p>Tokyo, at 1:23 PM today, the House of Representatives held a plenary session. After passing various legal bills, it deliberated on the issue of Okamoto Ichiji's speech. First, Chairman Shimada of the Inquiry Committee reported on the inquiry process and divided Okamoto's speech into three items: (1) Minister of Education Hatoyama had interceded with Iron Minister Saneto at the Bank of Taiwan to sell Imperial Rayon stock, and both ministers received generous gifts from both parties. (2) Minister of Education Hatoyama gave money to 130 members of parliament during the Mid-Autumn Festival and at the end of the year. (3) Minister of Education Hatoyama received a bribe of 50,000 yuan from Fujita, the manager of the Sakhalin Industries Company. Regarding these three points, each of the three parties expressed their opinions. Hamada, the Seiyukai Inquiry Committee member, represented the Seiyukai's opinion and denied that it was all slander and that there were no such facts. The Minseito party believed that the first and second items were still suspicious, but the third item was true. The National League believed that all three points were facts. Then, Hamada, Tanihara, and Noda represented their parties and expressed their opinions, and then the discussion ended. Chairman Shimada then made a decision on the three cases. The Minseito and National League's proposals could not be passed. The House of Representatives plenary session, based on the report of Chairman Shimada, conducted another roll-call vote. As a result, 206 votes considered it slanderous, and 120 votes affirmed that it was untrue. The Seiyukai, with the power of the majority party, denied the improper conduct of Minister of Education Hatoyama and decided to punish Okamoto Ichiji. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM.

<p>The disputed oilfields of Hulu District, which are under development, are being tendered for along the Russian coast this year. Because the Japanese bid was calculated at 32.5 sen per ruble, the Far East Fisheries Director of the Soviet Union considered this to be inconsistent with reality and declared the Japanese bid completely invalid. The bidding will be conducted solely by the people of the Soviet Union. In other words, the Japanese will not receive any of the 84 fishing areas currently being tendered. The Far East Fisheries Director of the Soviet Union holds that although this matter has not yet been formally approved by the Soviet Union Central Committee, it is theoretically and factually based. Firstly, regarding the exchange rate between rubles and Japanese yen in the fisheries aspect between Japan and the Soviet Union, it was agreed upon by Soviet Ambassador to Japan Troyanovsky and Japanese Foreign Minister Kijuro Shidehara. At that time, Japan still maintained the gold standard, and the Soviet Union also had a profound intention to develop trade with Japan. However, since Japan abandoned the gold standard in 1931, the value of the Japanese yen against foreign exchange has gradually decreased. Now that it is less than half of the gold parity, the Soviet Union's income will naturally suffer. The local finances are also greatly affected, so it is necessary to correct this. Secondly, the First Five-Year Plan has been quite successful, and foreign relations are gradually improving. With the aggressive advance of Japanese imperialists, appropriate countermeasures must be taken. Therefore, the Japanese bid was directly declared invalid.</p>
<p>Since the Far East Fisheries Director of the Soviet Union has declared his purpose, the Japanese side will naturally not accept it and will protest. The reasons held by the Japanese side are: (1) The exchange rate of the ruble was agreed upon by Ambassador Troyanovsky and Foreign Minister Shidehara in 1931, and it was determined that each ruble was worth 32.5 sen in Japanese yen. The Soviet Union unilaterally declared the abandonment of the exchange rate without consulting with Japan or waiting for Japan's permission, which is a violation of the agreement. (2) The right to bid for the lease of fishing areas in the Far East is jointly held by the people of Japan and the Soviet Union, and there is no difference. Now that the Soviet Union has unilaterally declared the Japanese bid invalid, it is a far cry from the Russo-Japanese Fisheries Treaty. Japan will never recognize this kind of differential treatment. Japan will argue with the Soviet Union based on the above reasons. This incident is even more intense than before. However, the Soviet Union has its consistent monetary policy. The price of the ruble against foreign exchange must be officially fixed by the National Bank. At the same time, the ruble is prohibited from leaving the country, and the secret carrying out of foreign currency will be confiscated. The entry of foreign currency is also subject to strict restrictions. Therefore, the Japanese claim of an exchange rate agreement has only one-sided reasons and cannot be compatible with the fundamental national policy of the Soviet Union. Therefore, this problem is not easy to solve. There is also the issue of oil extraction in the northern part of Sakhalin Island. In 1929, it was mined by the North Sakhalin Oil Company. Up to now, the invested capital is estimated to be about 5 million yen. The Japanese government's subsidy in 1932 was only 100,000 Japanese yen, and in 1933, it was only 230,000 Japanese yen. However, it costs 300,000 to 400,000 yen to drill an oil well, so the company's capital is very weak. The area that has been mined so far is only one-twentieth of the area with the right to try mining, and the area where the trial mining has been successful is only one place in northern Okha. Even if the Kaganingri district, where trial mining will be successful within this year, is included, the area is still very small, and the ore veins are poor, so there is little hope for the future. Recently, the Japanese side has planned to invest another 2.8 million yen of new capital to open seven new wells (six wells are currently under construction). However, if the northern Sakhalin Island oil fields are to be actively mined, at least 50 wells must be opened based on the part of the Japanese lease, and the capital required is 15 million to 20 million Japanese yen. Compared with the current situation, there is a world of difference. If we look at the Soviet Union's extraction of oil in this area, using the financial resources of its state-owned trusts, the current annual output is about 300,000 tons. After the Second Five-Year Plan, in 1937, the output will reach 1.2 million tons. Even if the Japanese North Sakhalin Oil Company is now working hard to increase production, the annual output is only 200,000 tons. There is also an urgent problem, that is, the Soviet-Japanese oil trial mining lease will expire in 1936. According to the current trend, the area of trial mining cannot be abandoned. Even if the trial mining has been successful, it will be subject to the strong resistance of the Soviet Union industry. Japan's ambition to seize oil will inevitably become an illusion (February 12, 1934).</p>

<h3 id="e101">He Jian Reorganizes Hunan Province Finances <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Provincial Government Meeting Approves Two Proposals, Changsha Correspondence In recent times, due to the withering of people's livelihoods and the exhaustion of tax revenue, the finances of Hunan Province and its counties have been extremely difficult. In order to strictly implement frugality, He Jian proposed a plan for reorganizing the income and expenditure of Hunan Province on February 13, which has been approved and implemented by the Standing Committee of the Provincial Government. Yesterday (27th) at 10:00 AM, the members and directors of the Provincial Government held the 441st Standing Committee meeting. He also temporarily submitted two major plans in writing for reorganizing the finances of Hunan Province and its counties. The attending members and directors unanimously approved and passed it, and it will be announced and implemented today (28th). The original plan is as follows: (1) No Additional Surcharges on Land Tax and Miscellaneous Donations are Allowed. It has been found that in recent years, the people's livelihood has reached the extreme point of withering. Although it is due to natural disasters such as floods and droughts, or the ravages of bandits and communists, the complexity of politics, the weight of taxes, and the frequent increase in supplies are also a major reason. The surcharges on land tax in various counties range from 18 or 19 yuan per official tax to 7 or 8 yuan at the least. The extraction is unlimited, but the people's strength is unsustainable. The cowardly are forced to flee, and the cunning therefore delay payment. The more urgent the collection, the deeper the people's suffering. In the end, the various undertakings that have been promoted either end halfway or fail to see success, so the huge sums of money spent on the preparations are also thrown into a void. If there is no change in course and rest for the people, the state of withering will be even worse than today. The Provincial Government, having seen this, specially dispatched the entire Provincial Committee in June of last year to tour various regions to investigate urgent matters and reduce them as appropriate. It has indeed been slightly reduced. However, later, various counties, due to insufficient funds, requested that the reduced surcharges be allowed to be restored, and some even submitted requests to increase them. If no restrictions are added, the additional surcharges will be endless. The Executive Yuan and the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission Nanchang Branch have repeatedly issued telegrams, stating that the rural economy is collapsing and we must seek revitalization, and ordered us to reduce or abolish the original land tax surcharges and various miscellaneous donations appropriately. Now that the local expenses of various counties have not been offset by other funds, it is difficult to sharply reduce the original surcharges. However, in the future, all undertakings that should be carried out should be based on the existing financial resources of the counties, and the plans should be considered, and they must not exceed the possible scope of the county's finances. Arbitrary expansion and requests to increase surcharges and various miscellaneous donations are not allowed, and the surcharges or donations that have been abolished are not allowed to be transferred for other purposes without authorization, in order to show restrictions. We must still find ways to save money and strive to gradually reduce them, so that the rural economy can gradually recover. Correspondingly, it is submitted to the general meeting and respectfully requests public decision. (2) The Expenses of Various Agencies Must Not Request Additional Funding. It has been found that in recent years, the country has been in turmoil, and natural disasters have occurred one after another. Hunan Province is located in a critical area and supplies are frequent. The people after the robbery have not yet recovered their vitality, the rural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, the people's strength is dwindling, and tax revenue is exhausted. It is impossible to find ways to increase revenue, and it is difficult to limit spending. Thinking about the past, I am always saddened. However, in times of worry and danger, we should encourage vigilance and sincerity. Loving the people is the way to save the country, and saving money is the way to love the people. In the future, the Provincial Government and the four departments of People's Finance, Construction, and Murder should share the purpose of benefiting the lower levels at the expense of the upper levels, cultivate a frugal and simple style, and weigh the importance of use. When spending, we must first measure the person. All expenses must strictly adhere to the budget. Even if there are any additional needs, they can only be saved from the original expenses and must not be arbitrarily proposed, nor can they be requested to be added afterward, so as to ensure that the people's strength is not exhausted and the official affairs are not closed. We must know that taking it has a limit, and it is even more important to use it sparingly. Saving a penny of financial resources for the people is to cultivate a share of vitality for the country. The way to govern lies in this. Therefore, a special case is submitted to the general meeting, respectfully awaiting the decision. (February 28)</p>

<p>Improving the Wuxi-Shanghai Road The Wuxi-Shanghai highway is a section of the Beijing-Shanghai National Highway. The section from Wuxi to Changshu was previously inspected by engineer Wang Yanquan from the Construction Department. The party, together with technician Jin Xinjing from the county government, started from Guangqin Road and inspected along the route for five days, passing through Dongting, Anzhen, and Guan Jian, and reaching the Changshu border. The existing route really needs to be improved and changed. A plan has been drafted to extend the starting point of the original route, Zhoushanbang, to Tonghui Road, in order to connect with the Xicheng and Xiyi roads. The second to twelfth curves of the original route, which are 4,450 meters long, should be changed to a straight line, which can reduce 250 meters of the concave in the roadbed. Also, if the entire road is improved, four bridges can be reduced, the route can be shortened by 900 meters, and the cost of other road surface construction and various vehicle consumption can be saved by 45,000 yuan. A description has been drafted and submitted to the Construction Department, ordering the county government to quickly remeasure, redraw the map, and carry out the work diligently.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Further Interrogation in the Bantang Temple Murder Case <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>An unidentified male corpse was found in Yanghuaibang, Bantang Temple, near Tangtou Town in the sixth district of the county. After the village head reported it, the county court prosecutor's office examined the body and found that it had been slashed in twelve places. The village head was ordered to prepare a coffin and enshroud the body, pending the arrest and investigation of the murderer. After extensive investigation, it was learned that the deceased was Hu Yutao, 23 years old, from Hujiawan, Jiangyin. He had two elder brothers, who were both in the cloth business. The deceased's behavior was always extremely romantic, so he was at odds with his family and eventually wandered outside. In the winter of the 19th year, he was arrested and imprisoned by the Jiangyin County for suspected counter-revolutionary activities. He was later rescued and released by fellow villagers. Although he later attended Qingdeng Middle School, he eventually dropped out due to his bizarre behavior. However, the county government's arrest warrant was not withdrawn, and he lived by borrowing money. This time, he was brutally murdered. Some say it was internal strife within the Communist Party, but it was actually a political assassination.</p>

<p>To return to the original topic, we spent a total of forty-eight days in Nanning. This month and a half was entirely consumed in referencing materials, compiling forms, dividing survey areas, and creating budgets. The most difficult part of our work was the lack of preliminary survey materials and the scarcity of existing reference materials. The gazettes of various departments and agencies, chapters, and magazine articles were not sufficient for us to create a survey plan. In addition, there were only some statistical data from the Statistics Bureau, that is, the manuscript prepared for compiling the Guangxi Yearbook. However, because the methods they used were indirect surveys rather than direct surveys, the bureau sent the prepared forms to the county political associations to be filled out by the county magistrates, so there were many questionable aspects to the materials. Mr. Yang Chuo'an has always advocated "rather be excessive than deficient" when it comes to statistical data, believing that "having something is better than having nothing." This is slightly different from our usual academic attitude. In this environment, the lack of preliminary survey data forced us to expand the scope of our work to include agriculture, industry, and commerce. We decided to organize a Guangxi Economic Survey Team, divided into three groups: agriculture, industry, and commerce. The agriculture group was led by Mr. Han Dezhang, the industry group by Mr. Wu Bannong, and the commerce and finance group was led by me. Each group recruited five to six to a dozen surveyors. Most of the surveyors were graduates of the Technical Personnel Training Institute run by the Statistics Bureau. They had received preliminary academic training in statistics and surveying. In addition, several colleagues from the Statistics Bureau also participated. Mr. Zhang Junmin and Mr. Liu Xuan (graduates of the Agricultural Department of Jinling University) participated in the agricultural group, and Mr. Yang Mingzhao and Mr. Liu Bingxin (graduates of Tsinghua University) participated in the industrial and commercial group. Our work plan was roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Agricultural Survey: The central questions are: in terms of crops, the emphasis is on the varieties, quality, output, cultivation methods, and costs of grain and important industrial raw materials; in terms of agricultural economics, the emphasis is on the production and consumption of farm households, farm household side businesses, the tenancy system, and rural finance. Survey areas: (1) the whole county, (2) Yangshuo, (3) He County, (4) Rong County, (5) Xiang County (6) Yishan, (7) Nandan (8) Teng County, (9) Yulin, (10) Binyang, (11) Guo [?])</p>
<p>De (12) Baise, (13) Longzhou</p>
<p>Industrial Survey: The central questions: This survey is divided into four aspects: (1) family industry, (2) scientific and industrial factories, (3) small factories using power, (4) new-style large factories. The issues to be emphasized are roughly divided into production relations, raw material supply, production costs, marketing conditions, labor livelihoods, and the rise and fall of various industries in recent years and the reasons, etc. In addition, the weaving industry is the most popular folk industry in Guangxi, but the clothing of the people of Guangxi still depends heavily on other provinces or overseas. [An investigation into the import of cotton, yarn and cotton cloth in recent years shows that it reaches] several tens of millions of dollars, which is the main reason why the trade surplus has increased year by year. This point deserves special attention and should be given special attention during the survey. Survey areas: (1) Nanning, (2) Wuzhou (3) Liuzhou, City, (4) Danghezhong, (5) Guilin, Lingchuan (6) Binyang, (7) Yishan) (8) Du'an (9) Yulin, (10) Rong County, (11) Pingnan, (12) Pingle, (13) Longzhou Commercial and Financial Survey: The central questions: In terms of commerce, the emphasis is on the commercial conditions, market conditions, sales of major items in various stores, profit and loss of operations, marketing of major import and export goods, and changes in prices, etc. In terms of finance, the emphasis is on the financial institutions, financial market conditions, currency system, and pawnshops in various places, etc. Survey areas: (1) Wuzhou, (2) Nanning, (3) Longzhou, (4) Baise, (5) Guilin, (6) Liuzhou, (7) Rubu (8) Guiping, (9) Pingle, (10) Yulin, (11) Guixian</p>
<p>After the work plan for the survey was decided, we began to make preparations for departure, such as purchasing folding beds, medicines, and setting up specimen collection boxes and printing various survey forms, etc. We had a total of eleven types of survey forms, each ranging from two or three pages to a dozen pages. Fortunately, our friend Mr. Lai Yanyu (Director of the Guangxi Printing Bureau) helped us greatly, so that the forms could be printed on schedule. This is something we are particularly grateful for in this survey.</p>
<p>But before I can actually go out on a survey, I have to talk about the languages of Guangxi. Originally, there are many dialects in various parts of China, not only differing from province to province and county to county, but also differing between the city and the countryside within a county. This is not only true in Guizhou Province, but Guangxi is undoubtedly the province with the most complex languages. They have what are called Mandarin, Baihua, Pinghua, Kehua, Konghua, Ronghua, Yaohua, Miaohua, [?hua], Guoguo hua, the variety of which is impossible to investigate, and each county has its own native dialect, which is not counted. We can say that no Guangxi person speaks all the Guangxi languages, just as no Chinese person speaks all the Chinese languages of the provinces. The most popular languages in Guangxi are Mandarin and Baihua. The so-called Mandarin is spoken in the Guilin and Liuzhou areas and is also called Guilin Mandarin. It is slightly flatter than Beijing Mandarin and is similar to Hubei and Sichuan dialects. Baihua is Cantonese. The reason why Cantonese is called "Baihua" is unknown. This type of Baihua is spoken in the Xijiang River basin and southern Guizhou Province, probably because it is close to Guangdong. In addition, Zhuanghua, Pinghua, and Hakka are also very influential. Often, several languages are used in one county. For example, Zhuanghua speakers account for about 60% of Liuzhou, while Baihua, Yuannan, and Hakka speakers each account for 10%. Nanning also uses Mandarin, Baihua, Pinghua, and Zhuanghua. It is almost non-existent for only one language to be used in one county. According to reports from civil affairs inspectors, the Guangxi Civil Affairs Association has produced a percentage comparison chart of various languages in Guangxi. According to the chart, Mandarin is spoken in 54.89% of the counties, Baihua is spoken in 62.22% of the counties, Hakka is spoken in 51.06% of the counties, Pinghua is spoken in 19.15% of the counties, local languages are spoken in 40.24% of the counties, Zhuanghua is spoken in 25.93% of the counties, Yaohua is spoken in 22.95% of the counties, Miaohua is spoken in 8.15% of the counties, and Tonghua is spoken in 2.22% of the counties. In total, they add up to 286.81%, which shows that each county uses an average of more than two languages. This time, we traveled to so many places and the distribution area was so sparse, so the difficulty of encountering language barriers was particularly serious. Fortunately, most of the surveyors we brought were from Guizhou Province, and they all spoke two languages, that is, Guangxi Mandarin and Baihua, and many could also speak Zhuanghua and Hakka. This problem was barely solved.</p>

<p>The Aviation Administration Sent Gao Zhishang to Shanghai to Test Fly. Another Trainer Plane Will Be Donated to the Flying Club. Tianchu Flavoring Essence Factory donated 100,000 yuan last year to order a fighter plane from the Junkers Aircraft Manufacturing Plant in Germany. It arrived in Shanghai on June 20 last year. After assembly, it was originally scheduled for 7</p>
<h3 id="e120">Photography After the Tianchu Aircraft Test Flight (Presented by Zhu Qingxian of Hehe Talking Picture Company) <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The naming ceremony was scheduled for the 16th in Hongqiao. Unexpectedly, on the 14th, the Aviation Administration sent personnel to Shanghai to conduct a test flight and acceptance inspection together with the Aviation Association and the Tianchu Factory. However, because the German pilot was relatively unfamiliar with the situation at Hongqiao Airport, he broke the aircraft parts and damaged the fuselage during landing. The Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory immediately requested Junkers to replace it with a new aircraft and compensate for the losses. Later, the German factory agreed to be responsible for the complete repair. After inspection by technicians sent by the Aviation Administration, it was confirmed that the repaired function could indeed be the same as a new aircraft, and the Tianchu Factory agreed to accept it. Because the German factory delayed delivery, it added another trainer aircraft as compensation for interest. Recently, the Tianchu fighter plane has been completely repaired, and the Tianchu Factory immediately notified the Aviation Association to request the Aviation Administration to send personnel for acceptance inspection. Xu Peigen, Director of the Aviation Administration, sent Gao Zhihang, captain of the fighter squadron, to Shanghai the day before yesterday. At 10 am yesterday, a test flight and acceptance inspection was conducted at Hongqiao Airport, and the naming will be scheduled separately. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e121">Test Flight Successfully Completed <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, those who arrived at Hongqiao Airport included Gao Zhihang, captain of the Aviation Administration; Chen Chengzhi, director of the General Affairs Section of the Aviation Association; Wu YunChu, manager of Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory (represented by Shi Zhicheng); Yan Shiren, manager of Zenshin Foreign Firm, which handled the matter; and Henke, a pilot from the Eurasia Aviation Company temporarily hired by the German factory. First, Henke boarded the plane and took off for a test flight of about ten minutes. Because it was an ordinary commercial flight, the Tianchu Factory requested a military performance. Yan Shiren, the manager of Zenshin Foreign Firm, then asked Gao Zhihang to fly and perform in his private capacity. After Gao made some inspections, he took off and performed side flights, climbs, somersaults, and other techniques for half an hour before finishing. Another trainer aircraft, which was given by Zenshin as interest, was also test-flown by Gao.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Naming Scheduled <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>After Gao finished flying and got off the plane, he said that the test flight results were very satisfactory and that the internal machinery was still in good condition. Then, Zenshin Foreign Firm handed it over to the Tianchu Factory for acceptance in accordance with the contract. A fighter plane and a trainer plane were accepted and temporarily parked at Hongqiao Airport. The naming ceremony of the fighter plane will be decided after Lin Wo, secretary-general of the Chinese Aviation Association, goes to Hangzhou to discuss with Director Xu and returns to Shanghai. After the naming, it will fly to Hangzhou to form a squadron. It has been decided that the trainer aircraft will be donated to the flying club organized by the Aviation Association.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Various Groups Send Telegrams Denouncing the False Manchu Regime's Usurpation <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The Righteous Army Support Association and the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association sent a telegram yesterday, which read: "To the attention of compatriots in overseas countries through various newspapers and telegram offices. Since the violent Japanese occupied the Northeast, they have held puppets and organized a false country. Now they are instigating the usurpation of the throne. The people of the Northeast will suffer even more. Fortunately, the righteous army commanders Wang Delin and Kong Xianrong led their brave soldiers to send a telegram denouncing the act, which has boosted the national anti-Japanese spirit. We hereby send a telegram of encouragement, which reads: 'To General Commander Wang, Deputy Commander Kong, and Commander Wu of the Northeast Volunteer Army: The Northeast has been lost for more than two years. In addition to military oppression, the violent Japanese have used despicable political tactics, holding the puppet Pu Yi to establish a false country, shaking our people's hearts and concealing the international community. The wolves' ambition is insatiable. Now they are instigating Pu Yi to usurp the title of emperor, hoping to complete the policy of invading and annexing Manchuria and Mongolia, to poison our Northeast compatriots with autocracy. When the news came, we were deeply indignant. You have risen from the people, loyal and brave for the country. For two years, you have fought hard in eastern Jilin, repeatedly defeating the enemy's advance. Your achievements are remarkable. We admire your dedication and perseverance. Our association adheres to the principle that everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the country, and we pledge to continue to work hard for the Northeast Righteous Army. We hope that you will lead the entire army to continue your efforts and unite with the righteous men of the four provinces to rise up together to punish the rebels. Our association will appeal to patriotic compatriots at home and abroad to provide unanimous assistance. We hereby send a telegram of encouragement. We hope you will understand.' We sincerely hope that compatriots across the country will rise up together to provide assistance. The future of the country depends on it. Sincerely, Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, winter."</p>
<p>The Citizens' Federation and the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation issued a telegram to compatriots across the country yesterday regarding the false Manchu regime's usurpation: "To the attention of compatriots across the country through various newspaper offices. The great traitor Pu Yi actually recognizes the enemy who teases his body and humiliates his personality as his own father. He actually regards the puppet that all countries around the world have long seen through as an honor. On the first day of this month, he unfortunately became a false ruler and usurped the title of false emperor. As for the enemy, they not only look down on the world but also cover their ears and steal the bell. They have raped the public will of our Northeast people and hope to annex our North China territory as if their great achievement has been completed. They are complacent and imitate the Korean precedent, so they can do whatever they want. However, the old man on the frontier lost his horse, so mourning is too early. It is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep is lost. The arrival of this kind of fact must be regarded as the current humiliation of the Chinese nation, and it must also be regarded as the future troubles of our Chinese nation. We read the news that our government will make a serious statement and absolutely not recognize the false organization. Our Foreign Minister Wang also had a profound conversation, the general idea is that the four provinces of Northeast China have always been in a state of military occupation, and Pu Yi himself has always been a puppet manipulated by others. No matter what the name or method, the essence is still a puppet. Our national law does not change its original intention due to the changes in the puppet's form. If any country violates this iron law and recognizes its puppet organization, it will also damage its national personality. The country has this strange humiliation and this future trouble. The authorities have learned from the past and expressed their determination. We are even more furious. How dare we remain silent? The people are the foundation of the country, and they have an unshirkable responsibility. However, without the unity of the whole country and cooperation, it will definitely not be enough to achieve practical results and control the strong barbarians. Our association and all the citizens are unwilling to give up our rights and listen to others trampling on us. We actively resist and strive to get rid of it, to inspire sympathy from all over the world, to bring the country to a rock, and we express our special telegram to you for your consideration."</p>

<h3 id="e132">The Cotton Industry Control Association Improves the Cotton Industry in Shaanxi <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Purchasing more than 4,000 dan of cotton seeds for distribution in Shaanxi. Experts are dispatched to form a cotton industry improvement office. Since Shao Lizhi, chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, took office, he has worked hard to resume work. Because Shaanxi Province has been suffering from droughts and floods for years, the people are struggling to survive. Although Shaanxi is the largest cotton-producing area in our country, it has been on the verge of bankruptcy in recent years. Therefore, he and the National Economic Commission's Cotton Industry Control Association jointly formed a cotton industry improvement office and are now starting to organize and distribute cotton seeds. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e133">Cotton Seeds Transported to Shaanxi <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Since the National Economic Commission's Cotton Industry Control Association received the request from Shaanxi Province to jointly form a cotton industry improvement office with Shaanxi and requested to purchase good cotton seeds for distribution to farmers in various places in Shaanxi for planting, the Cotton Control Association has appointed a special commissioner to purchase them in Zhangde, Henan. A total of more than 4,000 dan have been purchased, with a purchase price of about 3 yuan and 5 jiao per dan, totaling more than 10,000 yuan, which is垫借 by the Cotton Control Association. The cotton seeds have been transported from Zhangde to Lingbao. The association has notified Shaanxi Province to send personnel to transport them to Shaanxi. However, Lingbao to Shaanxi still needs to go through the Lingtong section of the Longhai Railway, and the freight is very high. The Shaanxi Provincial Government is financially strained and unable to pay. The office is now requesting the Longhai Railway Bureau to transport the cotton seeds to Tongguan free of charge. The bureau is still considering it, so the cotton seeds are still滞留 in Lingbao.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Agricultural Cooperation <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The Cotton Industry Improvement Office jointly formed by Shaanxi Province and the Cotton Control Association is now starting to organize. The National Economic Commission's Cotton Industry Control Association has appointed Xu Cudi, an expert from the Raw Materials Department, to conduct the work. After arriving in Shaanxi, it is also necessary to organize agricultural production cooperation enterprises so that farmers' produce will not be manipulated by merchants. Because the farmers in the area have been displaced since the disaster, their vitality has not recovered. Therefore, agricultural cooperation enables farmers to sell their crops at good prices, stabilize their lives, and gradually get them back on track. Mr. Xu studied in the United States and has a good understanding of cooperative undertakings. After returning to China, he engaged in cooperative undertakings and was the first to create China's cooperative movement. As for the date of Mr. Xu's arrival in Shaanxi, it has not yet been determined due to the many business matters to be discussed. Zou Bingwen may travel with him at that time.</p>

<p>The Trade Bureau is Negotiating with Russian Merchants. The Outcome is Still Unpredictable. The Jiangxi Provincial Government previously stated that the province is rich in tea production. In recent years, due to the impact of the global recession, the tea has been stockpiled and difficult to sell. It has requested the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to contact the Soviet Union to exchange tea for oil. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce immediately ordered the International Trade Bureau to plan and implement it. According to the Xin Xin News Agency reporter, after receiving the order, the International Trade Bureau immediately sent personnel to contact the Soviet Russian Aid Association for everything. As for the rumors that the contract will be signed soon, it is inevitable that it is too early to say. This matter has just begun to be negotiated by both parties, and all procedures are still to be discussed in detail. In addition, whether the Russian side agrees or not is still unpredictable.</p>

<p>The pronunciation is clearer than ordinary telephones. The bureau will continue to test calls with various places. According to Hua Dong News Agency, since the Ministry of Communications' International Telecommunications Bureau successfully prepared for direct shortwave communication between China and the United Kingdom, the results have been very good. The radio station for Sino-British communication can also be used for communication. Therefore, since the Sino-British communication, wireless communication has been conducted with London. The bureau has now stipulated that it will conduct test calls with various wireless direct destinations in Europe and the United States every week. Yesterday, the bureau conducted test calls with wireless radio stations in the United States and the Philippines. From 7 am to 8 am, the International Telecommunications Bureau in Shanghai communicated with San Francisco in the United States for an hour. The results were very good. After the communication with San Francisco was completed, the bureau conducted a test call with Marina in the Philippines until 8:30 am. The pronunciation of this call was clearer and the best among all the calls made by the Telecommunications Bureau with various places. The pronunciation was clearer than the wired telephone in this city. From 8:30 am to 9 am, San Francisco and Marina communicated with each other, and the International Telecommunications Bureau listened carefully and was also very clear. In the future, test calls will be conducted with various places. After success, formal communication will be possible.</p>

<h3 id="e142">Lanxi Will Hold a National Goods Exhibition <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Requesting the National Goods Factory Association for Sponsorship. The Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation received a letter from the Lanxi Experimental County Government yesterday, which stated, "It is important to check the national goods movement at present. Since the first National Goods Mobile Exhibition was held in Lan County by the Hangzhou Municipal National Goods Factory Federation in early April of the 20th year of the Republic of China, it has aroused the concept of the people of the county to use national goods, and the effect has been very significant. In order to promote national goods and expand publicity, we have sent a letter to the association and your association to hold the second National Goods Mobile Exhibition in Lan County in early April of this year. Recently, we received a reply that the association is also launching a large-scale national goods movement in Hangzhou at this time, and the various tasks are tense. I really feel that I have no time to handle it. I intend to ask the Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation to contact you. The association will still do its best to assist you and promote it together." In response to the letter, I hereby inform your association to check and hope that you will contact manufacturers in Shanghai and Beijing to visit Lan at that time to hold a national goods mobile exhibition to promote it.</p>
<h3 id="e143">International Trade Association Holds General Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese International Trade Association held its general meeting yesterday at the Bank Club. Members Liu Shimu, Zou Bingwen, Xu Xinliu, Wu Damu, Ren Sida, Li Shanshu, Guo Bingwen, Lin Kanghou, Luo Daojin, Sheng Zhuosan, and Qiao Wenshou, representing Zhejiang Industrial Bank, were present. Chairman Guo Bingwen reported on the association's activities, stating that international trade is the lifeblood of a nation's economy. In modern times, countries not only compete with each other with their full governmental power, but their people also pay absolute attention to promoting trade. China's trade deficit has been increasing year by year, reaching over 690 million yuan last year. The increasing deficit should be addressed. The association's mission is to develop foreign trade. Guo Bingwen and others were entrusted to preside over the association's affairs and wished to actively proceed. However, due to economic reasons, the original plan could not be completed, which they deeply regretted. The association's work can be simply divided into (1) investigation and research, (2) recommendations, and (3) communication. In investigation and research, the findings are printed into publications for the reference of various industries and scholars. There was a regular publication called "International Trade Weekly," but it was suspended in October of the 21st year due to lack of funds. There were also industry books such as "Directory of British, American, German, French, and Italian Trading Companies in China," "Survey of Shanghai Market Paper," "Export Guide," and "Procedures for Foreign Trade of Chinese Raw Silk." In terms of recommendations, they are either related to the interests of manufacturers or to national sovereignty, and are contributed whenever there are observations. For example, the current requirement for imported goods to be labeled with the name of the factory and place of origin is one of the association's recommendations. In terms of communication, there are many affairs such as cooperation matters, assistance in business, introduction, or reception, which are detailed in the report. In short, the association's mission is very important, especially under the current trade deficit situation. Special efforts should be made. On the occasion of the general meeting, a brief summary of past work is made. It is hoped that all comrades will unite more closely, continue to make progress, and determine the future direction to achieve the initial goals and complete the mission. Subsequently, the members discussed and passed the budget and several proposals, deciding to re-elect officers by means of communication. It is also heard that the association will amend its constitution to reduce membership fees in order to encourage participation from various industries and specialized scholars and enhance the effectiveness of research.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Ministry of Industry Orders Commodity Inspection Bureau to Conduct Hemp Export Inspection <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>To improve quality and maintain international credibility, the bureau is studying the order in detail. The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau received instructions from the Ministry of Industry yesterday, stating that the Hankou Commodity Inspection Bureau reported that hemp is a major export of China. According to customs reports, in the past three years, the average annual export volume from Hankou was 232,518 dan of ramie, 68,247 dan of jute, and 19,286 dan of kenaf. Foreign trade occupies an important position. However, Chinese farmers and merchants do not know how to improve. The quality is impure, the grades are uneven, and there are often cases of adulteration and counterfeiting, and sulfur fumigation, which damages the strength. As a result, it is not welcomed by foreign merchants, and the export volume has been decreasing. In order to promote improvement and revive the rural areas, it is proposed to conduct hemp inspection, with detailed rules attached for reference. It is found that this item of hemp has been approved by the Ministry to be held, and a copy of the provisional rules is sent for reference and implementation. After receiving the order, the bureau has issued it to the Agricultural Products Inspection Office for detailed study, and is investigating the export volume of hemp in this port in order to start preparations.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Silk Weaving Industry in Extreme Decline, Factories Revise Wage Standards <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>To maintain the precarious situation by reducing original wages, the plan was filed with the party and government yesterday to avoid disputes. The Shanghai Silk Weaving Trade Association stated that the silk weaving industry has been affected by the recession, and the business is in extreme decline. It is difficult for factories to maintain operations. Therefore, the wage standards have been revised and submitted to the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau for record to avoid disputes. The original submission stated that the silk weaving industry is in extreme decline and on the verge of bankruptcy. It is requested to revise the wages according to precedents to maintain the precarious situation and be filed for record. It is true that the member factories are affected by the recession, and the business is extremely poor. Many factories are on the verge of bankruptcy. After the major shutdown last year, those that did not go bankrupt also suffered losses. The silk market relies entirely on profits from sales prices, but the rural areas in the country are bankrupt, the purchasing power is weak, and the impact of Japanese goods is even greater. As a result, the sales price has plummeted, and various products have fallen below the cost price, which is a huge amount. Manufacturers with limited capital cannot stand the unlimited losses and cannot stand firm. Although they tried their best to plan to start work this spring, they are uncertain about the future and have no good way to maintain operations. It is found that there were more than 700 looms in the city, and only more than 4,000 looms were operating in normal times. The number gradually decreased last year, and only more than 2,000 looms were working at the end of the year, and they were all struggling to make ends meet. The number of unemployed workers is more than 10,000. Those who try hard to start work are thinking about the livelihood of the workers, and digging flesh to mend sores does not benefit the investors in the slightest. For example, the silk factory suffers</p>
<p>losses due to stagnant sales and falling prices. Although it has tried its best to save expenses and reduce costs, the labor cost is still the biggest burden. Because the electric silk weaving industry has progressed from the hand weaving industry, its regulations</p>
<p>The wages are calculated on a piecework basis. When the electric silk weaving industry was first established, the two people were not familiar with the machinery and produced less, so the wages were similar to those of the hand weaving industry. Later, the machinery became skilled, the efficiency was improved, the workers' skills advanced, and the output increased greatly, but the wages were still the previous standards. Therefore, the wages of the silk weaving industry in this city have always been the highest record of wages in various industries in this city. In the past, when the sales price was high, it could barely be maintained. Until last year, the price of goods fell sharply, and the wages remained the same, which is obviously unreasonable. For example, the most common weaving products in this city, He Shi crepe, each piece of labor costs an average of more than one yuan. In the past, the sales price of each piece was more than 20 yuan, and the labor cost accounted for about 5% of the cost. Recently, the sales price of each piece has fallen to 10 yuan, less than half of the original price, and the labor cost has not decreased, so it must account for 12% of the sales. As for the workers' output, it was less than one piece a day in the past, and recently it has doubled, and the workers' wages have increased a lot, but the factory has suffered losses, resulting in the silk weaving wages in this city, and</p>
<p>The cost of living is absolutely contradictory, and those who can fortunately avoid bankruptcy, can they get it? The member factories, in this turbulent autumn, think of the importance of the national production industry, and do not want to see the complete bankruptcy of the silk weaving industry. They only have to endure the pain and struggle, and try their best to save on all expenses. For unreasonable wages, they have to try to reduce them within the possible range. It is found that several member factories have been mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau and established in the winter, including: the wage for single crepe is 2.8 cents per yard, 6.2 cents for satin, 4.7 cents for double crepe, and 5.2 cents for jacquard machine.</p>
<p>The preparation wage is from 80 cents to 85 cents, and the after-wage is calculated at 85% of the original wage, which is still fair. The member factories of the association intend to revise the wage standards based on the above-mentioned wage settlement case, and respectfully request your Ministry (Bureau) to approve the record, so as to avoid disputes and maintain the precarious situation. This is for the public convenience. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, the Municipal Party Department, and Wang Shiqiang, Chairman of the Shanghai Electric Silk Weaving Trade Association.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Reasons for Disciplinary Action Against Relief Personnel in Northern Anhui <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Not due to Malpractice or Negligence. According to a report from the Guowen News Agency, regarding the case of disciplinary action against relief personnel in northern Anhui, the spokesperson of the National Government's Flood Relief Committee said yesterday that the case occurred in the autumn of the 21st year of the Republic of China. Supervisors Gao Yihan and others listed four main points of impeachment, including short-weighted sales, delayed flour production, and accused Quan Shaowu, Yang Shucheng, Cha Liangzhao, De Zhiruizhi, and Xin Boshen of suspected embezzlement and negligence. After more than a year of investigation by the Central Public Servants Disciplinary Committee, it was found that the impeached sections of short-weighted sales and delayed flour production were not due to malpractice. De Ruizhi and Xin Boshen were not subject to disciplinary action. However, official Quan Shaowu was given a reprimand, and Yang Shucheng and Cha Liangzhao were each given a demerit. The general idea of the disciplinary committee's decision was that (1) the sale of wheat flour was to meet the needs of the flood relief committee, and it was affected by the war in Shanghai at that time, not limited to the wheat relief in northern Anhui. The sale of wheat prices was carefully compared in Shanghai and was higher than the wheat prices purchased by import merchants from various countries at the same time, and there was no untrue or incomplete situation. (2) The short-weight item was not that the relief personnel in northern Anhui arbitrarily adopted weights and measures. There was a difference in the weights and measures, and there was a definite purpose. The profits and losses were all within the total income and expenditure of wheat relief, and no one could encroach on it. (3) For the flour production item, the US wheat in the US was converted into 72.6 pounds per hundred pounds. This time, 80 pounds of US wheat was converted into flour per hundred pounds, and there was no objection in each disaster area. Northern Anhui was a misunderstanding, and it was stopped as soon as it was opposed. (4) Regarding the delay item, the Flood Relief Committee sent Quan Shaowu as the special commissioner of relief in northern Anhui in early April. The people in the disaster area did not understand the facts and the relief process, and it was inevitable to misunderstand. The above four points are the actual situation of the disciplinary committee's decision on this case.</p>
<p>The committee has decided that there is no malpractice or negligence in the original four impeachment points. The truth is here. As for Quan Shaowu's</p>
<p>The reprimand was given because he was too strong and his measures were inappropriate. Yang Shucheng's two demerits were given because he argued with others and did not stop the relief transport and knew there was private but did not know there was public. Cha Liangzhao's demerit was given because he was the director of the emergency relief office and did not ask for help to stop selling Beng wheat due to the special circumstances in northern Anhui. The above points are the reasons why the officials should be punished. The outside world is unclear about the truth of this case, and the reports are diverse, which can easily lead to misunderstandings. Now that the facts have been proven, it is clear that this case is not related to embezzlement or malpractice.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Petition for Relief in Heze County, Shandong <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisei Association recently received a telegram from Sun Zeyi and Qin Jianbin of the Heze County Relief Association in Shandong, stating that more than 300,000 disaster victims in Heze relied on the association's relief to survive the winter. They are extremely grateful. However, no one is planning spring relief, and the disaster victims are extremely afraid. They earnestly request the association to do its best to appeal again and provide universal salvation. The kindness is immeasurable. According to reports, the emergency relief for the Yellow River flood in Heze County, Shandong, was jointly organized by the association and the Yellow River Flood Emergency Relief Joint Association last autumn. Director Li Yunmen was publicly recommended to go to investigate and release relief with relief friends. A total of more than 70,000 yuan of relief was released, and the disaster victims used this to survive the winter. Now it is the time when the old and new crops are not available, and it is most important for the disaster victims to have no food or clothing. The association's relief funds have been exhausted and cannot be continued. It is hoped that charitable comrades at home and abroad will work together to follow up and intercept the relief, so that hundreds of thousands of disaster victims who are waiting to die will have the hope of resurrection.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Suspects Arrested in Fourth District in Connection with Assassination <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>At about 3 am yesterday, Detective Hua Ci (transliteration) of the Jiaxing Road Police Station in the Public Concession led Detective Wang Chengying and informants to report to the Public Security Bureau of the Fourth District of Zhabei that Li Chunsheng, an accomplice in the assassination case of Wang A'bao in Nanfu Lane, Binggai Road, Concession, confessed that Ding Yunsheng, a co-conspirator in the case, lived in Zhujiawan, Zhongshan Road. The district immediately ordered police officer Tian Xiancheng of the Tanziwan Branch Station to rush to Zhujiawan and arrested Ding Yunsheng. After being brought to the district, Ding Yunsheng confessed that he was 31 years old and from Anhui. He said, "I know about the assassination of Wang A'bao. I also know Li Chunsheng, but I don't know who killed Wang A'bao. It has nothing to do with me. Please investigate." After the interrogator verified the confession, he considered that the case was related to assassination and should be reported to the Public Security Bureau for disposal.</p>
<h3 id="e151">HSBC Comprador Contract Lawsuit <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Wang Hu, the widow of the late Wang Huaisan, the first comprador of HSBC Bank and a native of Shaoxing, appealed to the High Court. Wang Hu argued that her father-in-law, Huai Can, had transferred the comprador's position to Xi Zhengfu, a native of Dongting Mountain, for joint management in the thirteenth year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty. A partnership contract was established, stipulating that all positions would be managed by Xi alone, with Xi receiving six shares of the annual profit and Wang receiving four shares. The distribution was the same over the years. After Huaisan's death, the distribution continued as before. Later, after Zhengfu's death, his sons Xi Ligong and Xi Lusheng succeeded him, and all official interest profits continued to be distributed as before. Later, because Xi Lusheng was kidnapped and killed, he transferred the HSBC comprador's position to Gong Ziyu without Wang's consent. All the profits and official interest that should have been received were cut off from then on. She then produced the original contract and came to Shanghai last year to negotiate with Xi's descendants to no avail. She then hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the civil court of the Second Special District Court against Xi Juxing and Boyu.</p>

<p>Business Report: The decline of our nation's rural economy, the desolation of industry and commerce, and the gradual encroachment of internal strife and external threats intensified by the twenty-second year. We bankers, faced with this difficult and precarious situation, have adhered to a prudent policy, developing in an orderly manner. On the one hand, we have restored the original purpose of public organizations, and on the other hand, we have collectively strengthened their foundations and promoted their progress. Over the past year, joint reserves have become increasingly substantial, and the results of check clearing have been quite remarkable. What we advocated and hoped for more than a decade ago, and repeatedly discussed without success, has now been achieved in less than two years. This shows that matters that are truly needed by the world, and that are entirely beneficial without any drawbacks, may not be timely at first, but will ultimately achieve their goals. However, as mentioned above, the country's situation is difficult and perilous, and the global economic panic has reached its peak. The arms race among the great powers has intensified, and the issues in the Pacific and the Far East are showing signs of escalating tensions. Shanghai, as an international market, has very significant interests at stake with various countries. Any international change, whether political, military, or economic, is enough to affect and shake Shanghai's financial markets like a sudden thunderclap. If a global state of peace cannot be maintained, then the impact and shock will be unimaginable. From the very beginning of its establishment, this association has had a specific and detailed plan for how to expand its group and increase its strength in the future to meet this future crisis. We deeply rely on our colleagues to plan ahead and provide timely advice so that this association can follow a path. We cannot express enough our sincere prayers. As we reach the end of the twenty-second year's financial settlement period, we respectfully present the following summary report on the business situation over the past year: (A) Department of Joint Reserves (1) Admission of New Member Banks: In September of this year, China &amp; South Sea Bank, The China Industrial Bank, China National Goods Bank, and The China Enterprise Bank simultaneously joined this association as member banks. Their voices were heard and their aspirations were met, greatly expanding the plan. The future of this association is promising. (2) Reserve Assets: The reserve assets deposited by various banks are mainly in the form of real estate and foreign securities. In January of this year, this association decided to include domestic government bonds as one of the types of reserve assets, considering that they were reliably guaranteed and had stable market prices after the implementation of the reorganization plan. At the same time, for the sake of extra stability, the percentage was restricted and the discount was reduced. The total amount of all reserves was 68.54% of the evaluated value in the previous financial settlement and 66.76% of the total evaluated value in the following financial settlement. According to the numbers in the following financial settlement, the breakdown of assets is: real estate accounts for 82.63% of the total, foreign securities account for 11.41%, and domestic government bonds account for 6.96%. (3) Various Documents and Interbank Lending and Discounting: The use of various certificates issued by various banks, in addition to being used as reserves, has increased compared to last year. However, the public certificate has been very scarce in circulation since its issuance last year. Considering that the original public certificates were limited to immediate payment and whole-number denominations, and based on our observations, they did not fully meet commercial needs, this association revised the public certificate regulations in May of this year and changed the design of the public certificates. While maintaining the characteristics of stability and reliability, we also endowed them with the functions of flexibility and convenience. At the same time, we increased the public certificate payment fund and changed the percentage of certificates issued, with public certificates and treasury bills each accounting for half. All of these changes took effect on July 4. By the end of the year, various banks gradually began to use the new public certificates externally. In the future, as this becomes a habit, it will definitely be beneficial to commerce. The revised public certificate regulations clearly stipulate the public certificate discounting method, so that it can complement interbank lending and achieve a regulatory effect. However, in Shanghai, the amount of silver deposited has increased from 430 million to 540 million, and the surplus capital is overflowing and congested. In this abnormal state of urban finance, the full implementation of the above-mentioned measures requires waiting and watching for a different day. After the implementation of check clearing, it was stipulated that the payable balance of each bank in one type of currency could be offset by deposits in other types of currency and transferred to the association for interbank lending. This has been done several times and has been quite convenient. (4) Exchange Bank Deposits: With the implementation of check clearing, each bank opened a current account at this association to receive and pay the exchange difference. At the end of the year, the total amount of deposits was 120 million silver dollars, of which silver dollars accounted for 42.25% and silver transfer dollars accounted for 57.75%. The concentration of funds means a thicker preparation, which is not only convenient for pastor's relief. (B) Department of Check Clearing (1) Summary of Affairs: This has been entrusted by the Shanghai Banking Association to handle check clearing matters. After five months of research and discussion, by the end of the year, preparations were completed. Thirty-two fellow institutions joined as exchange banks. On January 10 of this year, the check clearing house was officially opened. From the same day, the silver dollar check exchange was held. The total exchange on that day was 2,150,164.26 yuan, with 1,247 checks, which was the beginning of our country's exchange record. At that time, silver taels had not been abolished, and there were as many as four types of currencies commonly used in Shanghai. Because this association was a new initiative, it was planned that the check exchange of various currencies should be implemented step by step in order to proceed smoothly. On February 1, the silver transfer check exchange was added. On February 16, the silver tael check exchange was added. On March 1, the silver transfer tael check exchange was added. In order to suit actual needs, the originally scheduled exchange time was slightly changed, and the exchange site was moved from the association hall to the central hall. On March 1, the total exchange was 18,718,748.17 yuan, with 1,399 checks. The check exchange of the four currencies was thus fully completed.</p>
<p>On March 16, 56 branches of various banks in the city all joined the exchange, with the head offices of each bank acting as agents. The scope of the exchange was expanded from the urban area to the city area, and the convenience for each bank increased daily, and the function of the exchange became increasingly apparent. On April 6, the Shanghai banking industry was ordered by the Ministry of Finance to abolish the receipt and payment of silver taels. On the same day, the association abolished the silver tael and silver transfer check exchanges. By this time, the exchange business had become increasingly skilled, and the simplification of currency units from complex to simple gave the exchange a double benefit. The long-standing abnormal currency system was resolutely abolished. This is also what was previously said: "What is truly needed by the world, and is entirely beneficial without any drawbacks, will eventually achieve its goal." In the second half of the year, China &amp; South Sea Bank, The China Industrial Bank, and China Enterprise Bank simultaneously joined this association as exchange banks. In addition, many fellow silver and money dealers entrusted exchange banks to collect checks on their behalf. Shanghai's financial habits, such as the different procedures for interbank collection and remittance, the different times for collection and remittance, the different habits of check payment, and the difference between transfer checks and head checks, have a very long history. This association handles check clearing and wants to bring these complex and divergent old habits into a neat and unified new order. We dare not close the door and build a car, nor can we cut our feet to fit the shoes. From planning to implementation, from implementation to progress, the difficulties in the process are innumerable. Our colleagues deeply know that these difficulties are the inevitable stage of a new business. Openness, honesty, and cooperation have made all the reforms smooth over the past year. (2) Exchange Volume: The total exchange volume for the whole year was 1,666,451,761.83 yuan, with 900,260 checks. The average exchange volume was 6,576,761.74 yuan, with 3019 checks. Comparing the monthly amounts, the exchange volume increased from more than 2 million per day from January to April to more than 5 million. The gradual expansion of the exchange scope can be seen here. The records for each month thereafter have increased. By October, the exchange volume exceeded 9 million yuan. In November and December, the exchange volume was also more than 8 million yuan. Since April, the number of checks collected by various banks on behalf of others has increased daily, and the joining of new exchange banks has increased the scope of the exchange in tangible and intangible ways. This is the main reason for the increase in the exchange volume. Other factors, such as the gradual increase in commercial receipts and payments and the development of various banks' businesses, are also related to the increase in the exchange volume. However, the current exchange figures only account for a part of the city's receipts and payments. It can only be used as a rough estimate of financial trends. The ratio of the exchange difference to the total exchange volume was 40.16% in March. After the abolition of silver taels, it gradually decreased, and it was only 27.06% in December. The effect of shrinking currency can be seen here. (3) Exchange Expenses: Exchange expenses are shared by various banks in proportion to the total amount of receipts and payments for the whole year. Each 1,000 yuan of exchanged checks requires a fee of 1.1 cents. The savings in labor costs for fellow businesses compared to the past are not limited to the above-mentioned ratio.

<p>According to the Japanese Shanghai Daily News yesterday, Manchuria has traditionally had only two types of wine: yellow wine and sorghum wine. This time, a group of like-minded individuals have gathered in Fushun to establish the Manchurian Old Wine Company, with a registered capital of 250,000 yuan. They have hired Dr. Yamazaki, a former professor at the Dobunshoin, as a technician to imitate the famous Shaoxing wine. Currently, 8,000 wine jars are being exported from this port to Fushun, and it is expected that products will be available in April.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Silk Industry Slightly Rebounded Last Year <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, China's silk industry has been declining due to the dumping of foreign artificial silk. However, since last year, it has been able to rebound slightly due to the patriotism of the Chinese people. According to Mr. Wu Zhihao, after China's silk industry failed in Korea and Southeast Asia due to the dumping of Japanese artificial silk, it also became very sluggish in the country. However, since last year, Chinese silk has gained the trust of the Chinese people, resulting in a surge in purchasing power, increasing by 20% compared to previous years. Taking the Shanghai National Goods Company, which I run, as an example, the single item of silk crepe has also reached 700,000 yuan. The reasons for this are: (1) Chinese silk is cheaper, with prices more than half as cheap as in previous years. (2) Chinese silk has novel colors and patterns. Since last year, the colors and patterns of Chinese silk have been truly superior to those of artificial silk. (3) The cost of Chinese goods is low. Last year, silk prices were cheap, so the purchase price of silk was also low. The best-selling Chinese products are Hangzhou silk satin, followed by Shengze lake crepe and Shanghai's own factory silk. When asked about the company's plans for this year's national goods business, he said that the plans that are currently being planned and are about to be realized are the establishment of the Nanjing National Goods Company, as well as holding a North China Exhibition, that is, promoting in Tianjin, Beiping, Shanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, and other places, and also planning to form 100 national goods sales teams, divided into four locations. This year is the Year of Women's National Goods, so we also plan to form a women's national goods company, and all employees will be women. In June of this year, we will participate in the Chicago World's Fair. In addition, we will establish the Henan National Goods Company in Henan, which has also received the support of Chairman Liu, and there will be an industrial inspection team to inspect the fur and medicinal materials in North China. Recently, we also plan to establish a national goods factory and handle national goods flow mortgages in order to allow various national goods to flow and revitalize.</p>

<p>Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, said that the Panchen Lama has long admired the scenic spots of Shanghai and Hangzhou and plans to visit Shanghai and Hangzhou around the 20th of this month. Mr. Chu came to Shanghai from Beijing last week to discuss welcome matters with Shanghai Buddhist laymen Wang Yiting, Wen Lanting, and Jie Yingguang. A reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency paid a special visit to Layman Wen yesterday and inquired about everything. According to reports, the welcome of the Panchen Lama has been initiated by Yu and others, and Guan and other gentlemen have been publicly elected to prepare everything. It is reported that after the Living Buddha arrives in Shanghai, he will go directly to Hangzhou and plans to hold a Dharma assembly in Hangzhou.

<p>Mother Orders Girl to Watch the Home While Buying Vegetables, the Stove Fire Ignites Clothing, and She Dies a Martyr; Fortunately, the Seven-Month-Old Infant is Safe</p>
<p>Fan Fei, a shareholder of the He Xing Hing Army Bed Shop at No. 643 Edward Road, French Concession, is a native of Jiangxi and is 31 years old this year. His wife, Xing, is 30 years old this year. They have one son and one daughter. The daughter's name is Kaihua, and she is 7 years old this year. The son is 2 years old. In fact, he was just born and barely seven months old. The family rents accommodation in the room behind the hall at No. 649, the fourth door next door to the west of the shop. Fan himself works in the shop and goes out early and returns late. Two days before, Fan got up and went to work in the shop. His wife, Ren, felt that it was cold in the morning, so she made a stove to cook breakfast. However, she did not put it out immediately. At about 9 o'clock, Ren placed the infant in a wooden sleeping bucket in the room and asked the girl Kaihua to accompany him by the side. At this time, the charcoal fire in the stove was just glowing. The girl happened to be standing next to the stove with her back to the stove and her face towards the wooden bucket in which the child was sleeping. Unexpectedly, the lower corner of the back of her cheongsam happened to be covering the fire on the stove, causing the corner of the cheongsam to be ignited. The girl did not know it until the fire rose and burned through her underwear, causing pain to her flesh. She then realized it and cried loudly and ran to the bed. However, the fire on her clothes was raging, causing it to ignite the bed curtains. At that time, neighbors mistakenly thought that the child was being beaten and cried, and did not pay attention. It was not until flames burst out of the door and the room was filled with smoke that Mrs. Zhu He, a Suzhou woman living on the upper floor behind the residence, discovered the fire. She ran down to check and saw that the bed curtains were completely on fire, and the girl was also covered in flames. She immediately called neighbors to come and put out the fire with water. However, the girl's clothes had all turned to ashes, and her flesh had also been burned. Because the fire toxins attacked her heart, she immediately fell to the ground and died. However, the seven-month-old infant was fortunately unharmed. When the child's mother, Fan Ren, returned home after buying vegetables,</p>
<p>the girl was already dead and could not be saved. She immediately reported to the French police station, who sent detectives to investigate. They then sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall morgue. Yesterday morning, they reported to the Second Special District Local Court and commissioned Prosecutor Wang Ren to come to the morgue to examine the body. It was determined that the deceased girl, Fan Kaihua, had been burned to death before her death. After questioning the child's mother, Fan Ren, and the witness, Zhu He, the body was sent to the family for burial.</p>

<h3 id="e158">Kidnappers Appeal and are Sentenced to Life Imprisonment <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Originally Sentenced to Sixteen Years of Imprisonment. Sun Yushun's five-year-old son, Jiaobao, a native of Shaoxing, No. 52 Run'an Lane, Ximen Road, French Concession, was kidnapped by bandits while playing in front of his house at noon on May 20 last year. They demanded 8,000 yuan for his release. Negotiations failed, and the child died of illness in the bandit's den not long after being kidnapped. It was not until November that the French police arrested the kidnapper, Zhang Shuchuan, also known as Da Kaizi (36 years old this year), a Jiancheng native who swept the alley in Run'an Lane, and sent him to the Second Special District Court. According to Zhang's confession, he confessed to kidnapping with Yu Dashunzi and others who were at large. As a result, Zhang was sentenced</p>
<h3 id="e159">Reason for the Robbery of Dr. Robertson, a Western Doctor of the Public Works Department <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The thieves found out that Robertson issued 20,000 yuan in wages every month and prepared to intercept the car and rob him. Unexpectedly, the loot was very small. Lao testified in court yesterday about the robbery and the shooting. Robertson, a British Western doctor of the Shanghai Municipal Council, was suddenly attacked by bandits on Hardoon Road, West Shanghai, at 2:15 p.m. on January 31 of this year. The bandits robbed Robertson of cash, silver dollars, gold watches, and other valuables worth 470 yuan. Subsequently, Lu Liankui, the Chinese inspector of the General Inspectorate, and others cracked the case and arrested the bandits Dong Futang, also known as Chen Jinwen, Wu Tianxi, also known as Lao Jin, and Xu Yutian, all natives of Jiangbei. They also confiscated a pistol and seven bullets and sent them to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, the time for the continued interrogation had arrived. Jiang Baolian, a lawyer from the police station, stated that the third defendant, Xu Yutian, was found to be unrelated to the case and requested that he be released first. The court approved the request. Lawyer Jiang continued, "Currently, the police station is prosecuting the two defendants, Dong and Wu, for attempted murder under Article 282, Section 2 of the Criminal Code and robbery under Article 348. However, the reason why the defendants wanted to rob the plaintiff was only recently found out by the police station. It turned out that the defendants had learned in advance that the plaintiff would carry a large sum of money to his office at the end of each lunar month to distribute wages. This time, he was carrying 20,000 yuan in cash and silver dollars, so they carried out the robbery on January 31. Unexpectedly, the loot was very small." Then, the plaintiff, Robertson, a British national, testified that he lived at No. 1391 Avenue Joffre, French Concession, and was a doctor. At 1:45 p.m. on January 31, I took my Chinese servant and his six-year-old son in my own car to my office to vaccinate. Unexpectedly, when I passed Hardoon Road, I saw a small car blocking the road. My driver stopped the car. At that time, four bandits suddenly jumped out from both sides and drove the driver away. One side pointed a gun at me to intimidate me. One bandit was driving, and there were three bandits in front and one bandit behind me watching me. I felt very strange and did not know what was going on. I was about to shout for help, but it was too late. I was rushed forward. I argued with them many times, and one bandit even fired a gun, and the bullet pierced my overcoat and injured the finger of his accomplice. Later, I was afraid that they would misunderstand and hurt</p>
<p>the child, so I quickly declared in imperfect Shanghai, "This child is the son of my chief steward and is very poor." Then, I reached into my pocket</p>
<p>and took out a watch and gave it to them, saying, "This watch is very expensive and can be pawned for more than a hundred yuan." I also hugged the child from the front to the back and hid him inside my coat. I was afraid that they would continue to shoot, so I threw a blanket on my arm to prevent accidents. After traveling for a long time, the car had reached Avenue de la Victoire in the French Concession. I was deeply afraid that further resistance would endanger my life, and one bandit pointed his finger at my head and pulled the trigger. Fortunately, the bullet was jammed and did not come out, otherwise it would have been unimaginable. So I gave them a wallet containing 250 yuan in cash and silver dollars. At that time, because the road was uneven, the car slowed down. I took this opportunity, hugged the child, opened the car door,</p>
<p>jumped out, and went to the police station to report. Defendant Dong Fuqi admitted to the robbery, but Wu Tianxi denied participating in the incident. He said that on the day of the plaintiff's robbery, I happened to be selling land in my hometown of Zhenjiang, and then I came to Shanghai to meet with Lawyer Yang Huchen. This can be investigated. Then, the defendant's lawyer, Yang Chuchen, and others stood up to testify. Judge Xue instructed that the case be adjourned for seven days for investigation and re-examination. The two defendants, Dong and Wu, were returned to custody.</p>
<h3 id="e160">A Wicked Mother-in-Law and Unscrupulous Husband: Virtuous Woman Sold into Prostitution <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>The younger sister came to Shanghai to visit, only to discover the truth. They first encountered each other at the gate of the Sincere Company and were taken to the authorities. The wicked mother-in-law and others are being held for investigation. Gao Qiaomei, a woman from Changzhou, is twenty-nine years old and has a beautiful appearance. Because her family was poor, she was sold into the family of Gao Chunsheng, a local, as a maid at the age of five. When Qiaozhen was only fourteen years old, Mrs. Han Xu, a Suzhou woman residing at No. 29, Lane 312, Qipulu Road, came to the Gao family seeking Qiaomei as a daughter-in-law, because her son, Han Agen, was already over twenty and still unmarried. Chunsheng immediately agreed, drew up a formal marriage contract, and she entered the family as a child bride. On September 13th two years ago, Qiaomei turned sixteen and married Han Agen. However, on December 26th of last year according to the lunar calendar, Agen, claiming that Qiaomei's behavior was improper, conspired with his mother, Han Xu, along with Wang Zihe, Ma Changsheng, a woman named San A'jie, and a Tong surnamed person, to sell Qiaomei into the brothel run by Shen Heshang at No. 13, Derun Lane, Tianjin Road, for 169 yuan, which they divided and spent. Qiaomei knew she was falling into a fiery pit, but because she was under the oppressive power of her wicked mother-in-law, she could not resist. From then on, every evening when the lamps were lit, a maid accompanied Qiaomei to the rooftop garden of the Sincere Company,</p>
<p>where she enticed guests to stay overnight, using her body to earn money, available to anyone who would pluck her. The other day, Qiaomei's elder sister arrived in Shanghai from their hometown and went to Gao Chunsheng's house to visit her sister. Gao told her that Qiaomei had</p>
<p>married Han Agen. She went to the Han family, but was unable to meet her and learned that her sister had been sold into prostitution. She quarreled with Gao and secretly inquired around the Han family, confirming that Qiaomei had indeed been sold as a prostitute and often solicited customers in the Sincere rooftop garden. Gao Chunsheng then went to the Sincere Company and, by chance,</p>
<p>met Qiaomei at the entrance. He seized her and took her to the Laozha Police Station, which transferred her to the Huida Great Detective's Office. After Hua Detective Liang Yuliang and Bao Detective Ji Xiucai inquired about the above situation, they, together with Western Detective Moore, arrested Han Xu and Wang Zihe. The others had already fled. They also went to No. 13, Derun Lane, Tianjin Road to arrest Shen Heshang, but he had also escaped. Only a prostitute named Wang Xiuying from Pinghu, nineteen years old, was found in the house and</p>
<p>taken back to the police station. The police chief ordered that Mrs. Han and Wang be detained separately. Gao Qiaomei and Wang Xiuying were temporarily sent to the Jiliang Institute. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer Jiang Baolian then presented the previous situation and filed a lawsuit based on Article 257 of the Criminal Code. Gao Chunsheng then stated that Qiaomei was taken in as a maid by his mother when she was five years old, and that she married Han Xu's son Agen at the age of sixteen. Both parties had a marriage contract and he was unaware of the sale into prostitution. Gao Qiaomei also stated that she entered the Han family at the age of fourteen and married Han Yaogen at the age of sixteen. On December 26th of last year, she was sold into prostitution by her husband and mother-in-law to Shen Heshang. The introducers were Wang Zihe, Ma Changsheng, and an unnamed person. The price was 170 yuan, with Wang taking one and a half yuan as a broker's fee, Ma and someone else each getting ten yuan, and the rest being taken by the Han mother and son. However, they did tell her at the time</p>
<p>that she was being sold into prostitution. Judge Wu Tingqi stated that the police's accusation under Article</p>

<p>The Hebei Native Association in Shanghai will hold its general meeting today (the 4th). The association has already notified all members to attend. If any members are skilled in the arts, such as members of the China Flying Car Troupe, Martial Arts Troupe, crosstalk masters Guo Rongshan and Han Yongxian, comedic masters Fang Renmi, Wang Mo, Zhang Hama, and Jiang Datou, Jingyun Dagu masters Bai Yunpeng, Fang Hongbao, Han Xiaolan, Han Xiaoxiang, Shanyao Dan, Li Lanfen, and He Yanqiao, they are all welcome to join the performances. In addition, Pan Gongzhan, Guo Mingjiu, and Jia Botao have been specially invited to give speeches at the meeting. Furthermore, after the association telegraphed its opposition to the Tianjin Municipal Finance Bureau's increase in brokerage tax, the Guangdong Native Association also sent a telegram in support. The original telegram is as follows: To Chairman Huang of Beiping and Chairman Yu of the Tianjin Provincial Government, We have learned that setting up checkpoints to collect brokerage taxes on fresh goods violates the municipal brokerage tax regulations. Moreover, collecting transit taxes on southern fresh goods that have already paid national taxes, forcing them to operate without brokers, is essentially a disguised form of likin. Sugar cane and oranges are special products of Guangdong Province, and your province is the only major market for their sale. Now, Tianjin merchants have suspended operations, and with the approach of warm spring weather, these goods are easily susceptible to spoilage. If transportation is not urgently resumed, the people of Guangdong will face starvation. We, as merchants, are appealing on behalf of the people. We humbly request that your esteemed chairman order the cessation of brokerage tax collection and instruct the Finance Bureau to find alternative solutions. We implore you to alleviate the suffering and allow normal transportation, so as to relieve the plight of the people and ease the difficulties of merchants. We will be eternally grateful and await your reply. Tang Haian, Chairman of the Guangdong Native Association in Shanghai, bows in winter.</p>

<p>Renamed Zhejiang-Anhui Travel Agency, Automobile Department Already in Operation. Huang Yusheng, Wu Mingxin, Cao Zhigong, and others, Hui merchants in Shanghai, recognizing the increasing number of Hui people traveling back and forth after the opening of the Hangzhou-Hui road, joined forces with Hong Peiwen, Jiang Qingquan, and other Hui merchants in Zhejiang to establish the Huihang Travel Agency, seeking to provide convenient travel for fellow Hui natives. Now, with the increasing development of transportation between Anhui and Zhejiang provinces, extending beyond just the Hangzhou-Hui route to roads like Chuntun and Sutun, which are also slated to open soon, the organizers convened a meeting the other day and decided to expand the organization, renaming it the Zhejiang-Anhui Travel Agency. To meet the needs of fellow natives, the Hangzhou branch was established first. The agency address has been fixed at No. 46 Wushan Road, West Lake, Hangzhou. Six new-style automobiles purchased in Shanghai have been transported to Hangzhou for use. Therefore, the Automobile Department is already in operation, with low prices and convenient services that have been widely praised by travelers. The Shanghai office is temporarily located at the Huining Native Association, No. 21 Hongxiang Lane, Xinzha Road. Fellow natives who have inquiries can contact the office for introductions.</p>

<p>The China Industrial and Commercial Management Association held its 46th luncheon discussion meeting yesterday at the Linhua General Association on Beijing Road. Attendees included Li Zhaohuan, Fang Yexian, Tu Zheyin, Cheng Shouzhong, Chen Bingzhang, Pan Yangyao, Cao Yunxiang, Fang Xijian, Guan Renshi, Song Peidao, and over forty others. During the meeting, Shao Zenghua was invited to lecture on production management. A member of the Bingxun Stenography Agency was dispatched to record his speech, which stated in brief: Production management is a major branch of scientific management. Scientific management is the answer to problems in industry and commerce. The goal of industry and commerce is to make profits, so scientific management is the way to pursue profits. Profits can be pursued by expanding sales and reducing costs. Setting aside the former for the moment, the method of reducing costs can be divided into obtaining cheap raw materials and reducing manufacturing expenses. How to reduce manufacturing expenses is the task of production management. As for the method, there are roughly three aspects of savings: labor, raw materials, and machinery. Although the goals of production management are the same, the systems adopted vary. It is impossible to determine which is right or wrong. The key is for each factory to properly assess the situation, adopt legal methods, and then achieve the goal of profit.</p>

<p>Since its opening on New Year's Day, the Children's Dental Clinic established by the Family Industry Society has been overwhelmed with patients. Although February was the end of the old lunar year and various sectors were busy with closing matters, and the clinic also closed for four days during the Spring Festival, the total number of children treated during the month still exceeded 490. The clinic's booming business can be imagined. The clinic is fully equipped, charges low fees, and is a first of its kind in the country. The Municipal Education Association has issued a notice to all schools stating that students with unhealthy teeth can go to the clinic for treatment to avoid hindering their development.</p>

<p>Truly, it is a case of suffering without being able to speak. Qiu Minrong, a 22-year-old Cantonese man, was born deaf, mute, and with a limp in one leg. His parents died early. At the age of ten, he entered the Shanghai West School for the Blind and Deaf. Because of his sincerity and diligence in his studies, he was deeply valued by the school authorities and teachers. After graduating, he was retained by the school as a teaching assistant, receiving a monthly allowance of $18. In addition to assisting with school affairs, Qiu was also responsible for collecting donations from various places. The other day, it was again time to collect this year's donations. Qiu left the school at 1:00 PM and went to the China Merchants Securities Exchange and Hengshun Bank on Sanma Road, where he collected a total of $275. After completing his task, he planned to return to the school to report. However, as he was walking near Pingliang Road, three thugs resembling workers suddenly jumped out from the roadside and blocked his path. One of the thugs stepped forward and snatched the leather bag from Qiu's hand. Then, they also seized the $18 salary and 14 cents he had just received from Qiu's pocket. Qiu was initially panicked, but seeing that none of the three had guns, he desperately gave chase, but was unable to call for help. At this moment, a car suddenly drove towards him. Qiu tried to stop it for rescue, but the car turned east without stopping. Seeing this, the three thugs feared that encountering another vehicle or passerby would lead to their capture. So, they turned back, knocked Qiu to the ground, and used iron pliers and files to beat him severely. As a result, Qiu was knocked unconscious. The three thugs fled without a trace. About a quarter of an hour later, a car passed by. The people in the car saw Qiu dressed neatly, lying in the middle of the road, so they got out of the car and helped him up.

<h3 id="e167">Apprentice Robbed While Buying Silver Coins, Never Returns <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Was it fear of responsibility or a disappearance? Chen Zongwen, the owner of the Xie Xing cigarette and paper shop on Wutong Street in the city, reported to the police that his apprentice Huang Baolian (17 years old, from Chongming) was ordered to go to the tea market at 9:00 AM yesterday morning with $30 in paper money to buy silver coins. Unexpectedly, on the way, two robbers in the middle of the road robbed the apprentice of the paper money on him and pushed him to the ground. However, after Huang Baolian got up, he desperately chased after the robbers and did not return until late at night. The shop owner Chen Zongwen did not see the apprentice return at lunchtime, realized something was wrong, and went to search for him. He learned from bystanders that Huang Baolian had been seen chasing the robbers and falling to the ground. The shop owner Chen Zongwen did not dare to speculate whether the apprentice was afraid of being held responsible and did not return to the shop or whether he disappeared while chasing the robbers. Therefore, he wrote a report and submitted it to the Second Precinct of the First District, asking them to pay attention and investigate.</p>

<p>On September 27th of last year, at about 7:00 PM, the home of Yuan Cao, a woman living at No. 42 Hele Lane, Xinzha Road, was robbed of valuables worth $314. The Hongkou Police Station subsequently arrested the perpetrators Zhang Baocheng, Zhang Zirong, Chen Haiqing, and three others, and also arrested Fan Xiaomei for the separate crime of luring and selling women for profit. They were sent to the First Special District Court, where they confessed that their accomplice, Zhou Hailin from Jiangbei (who is blind in his right eye), had also participated in the robbery. Zhang and the other three have been sentenced to various terms of imprisonment. The other day, Min Huihai, a Chinese detective from the Disui Road Police Station, learned that the perpetrator Zhou was hiding at a certain address on Taipingqiao Road, Gaochang Temple, in the Nanshi area. He reported this to the chief detective, who, along with the Western detective Weitemi, went with detectives from the local Public Security Bureau to arrest Zhou and bring him back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court. Wang Yaotang, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, stated the previous circumstances and said that the defendant did not confess at the police station, but his blindness in the right eye matched the description provided by Zhang Baocheng. He asked for a postponement to investigate further. The defendant firmly denied the charges, saying that he had always been a small fruit vendor and knew nothing about the case. He asked for leniency. Judge Wu Zehan ordered that he be remanded in custody and that the matter be investigated and verified at a later date.</p>

<p>Prices are surprisingly cheap! Business competition is an unavoidable reality in modern times. The Daxin Silk and Satin Store, located on the corner of Sanma Road and Shilu Road, is holding a surprising competition sale because the Huahua Silk and Satin Company across the street is holding a spring sale. Considering the environment, the store is unwilling to fall behind, so it has purchased all the silk goods from the local Huaxin Silk Weaving Factory, with many patterns and cheap costs. From today, it will reluctantly sacrifice profits and hold a surprising competition sale. This is a rare opportunity for consumers.</p>

<p>The Sino-French Friendship Association previously borrowed the French Cultural Association as its office location because it was newly established. However, the association felt that the building was small and insufficient for its needs, and the association was planning to build its own building, which would take a long time. After the second board meeting, it was decided to find another building. It has now found a temporary location at No. 577 Route Lafayette (west of Rue Massenet), a large house. It is currently arranging everything, and once everything is in order, an opening ceremony will be held, which will surely be a grand occasion.</p>

<h3 id="e178">Letters to the Editor <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor, I am writing to you regarding an article published in your newspaper on the 24th of this month, which stated that in a document submitted to the Ministry of Industry, it was stated that in November of last year, a document was prepared with attached drawings and specifications, and submitted to the Central Industrial Testing Institute of your ministry, requesting a fair evaluation and a certificate so that funds could be raised to complete the entire project and put it to practical use. Although several submissions have been made, no reply has been received. It is very confusing. There is a slight discrepancy between the news and the facts. According to us, we did not directly submit the document to the Ministry of Industry or the Central Industrial Testing Institute. However, the drawings and specifications were sent to Mr. Chen Xuanren of the institute on December 6 of last year for forwarding. The reason why it has not been approved so far is that, according to a letter from Mr. Chen, the matter is a private exploration, and the procedures are not formal, resulting in delays. The matter concerns the reputation of the year. In addition to writing to the institute to clarify the misunderstanding, we are writing to you specially to request a correction. We wish you all the best. Sincerely, Dan Chunqiao and Chen Xinbiao, inventors of the self-powered engine. March 3.</p>
<p>To the editor, Regarding the article in your newspaper on the 2nd of this month concerning the dismissal of Min Luobing, a candidate for the executive committee of this association, it stated that he was denounced to the Central Party Headquarters, and after the Party Headquarters sent personnel to investigate on the ground, it was found that Min had mishandled the strike at the Wusong Machinery Factory on the two railways, so he was specifically ordered to be dismissed and investigated. This is not consistent with the facts. I hope you will check and correct it. Sincerely, The Executive Committee of the Special Party Headquarters of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways. March 3.</p>
<p>To the editor, Today, your newspaper's local news section published a report on our association's representative meeting yesterday. There are still some mistakes, please correct them as follows: (1) Chairman of the Committee: Committee Member Runqing requested leave due to business, so the Standing Committee Member served as chairman. (2) The discount for February is 2.95%, starting from February 18, because that day was the first day of business after the end of the 22nd year of the general manager's term. Please publish this letter in the letters section as a correction to avoid misunderstanding. Sincerely, The Shanghai Money Trade Association, March 3, 23rd year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Reading and Writing Q&amp;A <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Reading and Writing</p>
<p>Reading Guidance··</p>
<p>At this moment, although I am writing this letter with great excitement, hoping that you will instruct me on how to solve these self-study difficulties, I am afraid that my requests will exceed the scope set by your department, or that you will not answer my request, right? Therefore, although I write at length and continue to hold the pen, I am somewhat worried. But I don't know if you will really abandon me and not reply? Probably not, right? I think so.</p>
<p>Sir! Like Zhou Yun, who published in the "Reading Q&amp;A" column the day before yesterday, I am a person who has faith in new literature and has creative ambitions; and I am also a person who graduated from elementary school and dropped out of school without any written foundation; and my environment is exactly the same as Zhou's. I am a shop assistant, facing time constraints, and only have two precious hours of free time from 8:00 PM to 10:00 PM to work freely as much as possible. In these two extremely precious hours, although I have the wish to never give it up casually, when I review what I did in these two hours in the past, it is really a bit difficult to believe myself. Zhou Jun once said: "Comparing the results of unknowable future efforts with the emptiness of the past and present, it really makes me a bit dazed! In difficult and irregular self-study, the brain often shows confusion..." and also said: "...sometimes even too lazy to look up the dictionary, and there is no way to ask about places that cannot be understood. Just like this, just like this, time flies, and age increases, what achievements are there? Emptiness, confusion!" These few words of self-confession are indeed a true reflection of me! When I read Zhou Jun's letter, what made me feel even more ashamed was that Zhou Jun modestly thought that in irregular self-study, being able to jump from the level of an elementary school student to being able to write a decent letter with fluent and orderly words was comforting enough, but when I reviewed my so-called self-study in the past, it really made me lose the courage to recognize myself more deeply. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Acknowledgment: Yesterday, the Propaganda Committee of the Central Executive Committee handed down two volumes of political achievement statistics for November and December of the 22nd year. Thank you.</p>

<p>Winning the right to the final against the Western Police</p>
<p>Sharp Forwards Leave Laks Helpless. In yesterday's Scoto Cup semi-final, Donghua defeated Laks with a score of 4-2, winning the right to the final. They will compete with the Western Police for this silver cup. Chinese teams have never touched the Scoto Cup before, so there is great hope this time. The result of the first half yesterday was 2-1. The audience in Shen Garden was not crowded, only reaching 70% capacity.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Donghua's Offense Exceeds Defense <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Donghua's forwards performed extremely sharply yesterday. The goals scored were also very clear and impressive. The defensive line was only average. Laks was often seen harassing in front of the goal. The last goal was entirely due to Guan Xun'an's carelessness. Among the five forwards, Chen Hongguang was the least successful. Both wings, Wan Sheng and Yu Jia, were as usual. Li Yichen was also better than usual. Donghua's offense exceeded its defense.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Laks' Defense Exceeds Offense <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Laks was the opposite, with defense exceeding offense. Goalkeeper Kirklen made many excellent saves. His merits and demerits were half and half, only because he was not calm enough, which led to mistakes. Qinsheng Logan, the defender, and center-back Samos were very experienced. Donghua failed to break through many times because of them. However, H. Kirklen's midfielder had no use. The front line, except for the wings, was still presentable. Cooperation was extremely lacking. A plate of loose sand. The balls sent from left and right frequently could not be used. They could not attack the goal in front of the goal, and center forward Notte also did not have the skill to control the ball.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Both Sides Had Opportunities <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Laks kicked off. Donghua, with their backs to the sun, already had an advantage. Wan Xianghua kicked a ball. Qinsheng passed it back. Feng Yunyou sent it to the right. Jia Youliang crossed it beautifully. Li Yichen and Zai Linjing jumped to head the ball, but it didn't go in. The situation was average, with each side attacking and defending. The center forward was seen shooting at the goal, and Kirkland saved it. Tou Tuoman ran straight to the right. Li Mining blocked him but failed. It was a pity that there was no one to respond on the left. Zhou Xianfang then slapped it out. Feng passed to Xianghua. There was no one behind Laks. Li Yichen got the ball and attacked, but Kirklen was able to save it. Zai came to catch up, and Madda headed it out for a save.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Goalkeepers Show Their Skills <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Jia Youliang shot from the left and right at the goal. Kirkland jumped up and caught it again. Adige flew to the left and attacked the goal fiercely. Zhou Xianyuan also saved it. The ball came out from Zhou. Baosailie got it. Tou Tuoman hid in the right corner, but did not pass to the right but to the left. Adige shot again, and Zhou saved it again in a very dangerous situation. At this time, Laks' right midfielder Migajie suddenly injured his foot due to Li Yichen's kick. Donghua then took the opportunity to attack fiercely, but still could not break through. Not long after, Migajie's pain stopped and he recovered from his injury, and re-entered the field to fight.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Donghua Advances Again and Again <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>After 30 minutes of hard fighting, neither side had the advantage. At this time, the situation suddenly opened up. Donghua broke through the goal and advanced, and once they advanced, they advanced again. Zai Linjing advanced from the center forward. Qinsheng lost his footing at this critical moment. Kirkland then took the risk of rushing out, but failed to catch the ball. It bounced back onto Zai's feet, and he took the opportunity to send it in. When the record was opened, cheers rang out. Laks was encouraged to counterattack, but could not find its place. Who knew that three minutes later, Jia Youliang shot a high ball from the left and right corners. Kirkland jumped up and missed the ball, which fell behind him.</p>
<p>Wan Xianghua rushed up and poked it in, just in time to enter the net, making it 2-0.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Laks Attacks When People Are Unprepared <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>With only five minutes left in the first half, Laks continued to counterattack fiercely, constantly harassing and disturbing. Sure enough, in the midst of the chaos, they managed to kick it in. Tou Tuoman attacked along the side and flew the ball to the middle. Baosailie jumped up to head it but failed. When the ball fell, Laks surrounded the goal and tried to jump in. Notte took the ball and passed it lightly to the left. Adige took advantage of the unpreparedness of others and kicked into the loophole. The first half ended with a score of 2-1.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Xiao Zai Achieves Another Success <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>If it doesn't come, it won't come; if it comes, it will come again. In the second half, Donghua kicked off. Donghua faced the sun, and the effect was immediately visible. Laks' momentum was greatly enhanced, and they were constantly pressing. Adige kicked, and Basailie and Notte were a little late to catch up, otherwise they would have scored. This happened for a quarter of an hour without any effect. Suddenly, a surprising force from Donghua appeared. Wan Xianghua was as fast as a horse. When he reached the key area, he flew up and sent the ball to the middle. Zai Linjing had already caught up and was waiting. Without waiting for Kirkland to catch it with his hand, he waved his head and headed it into the goal. The situation was so clear that it was as if it were right in front of our eyes.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Donghua Treats Guests at the End <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>If it doesn't come, it won't come; if it comes, it will come again. Ten minutes later, Li Yichen also made his first contribution. Wu Youliang also shot from a distance. The ball went back and forth in front of Laks' goal for a while. Li Yichen saw an opening and took the opportunity to kick, making it 4-1. Since Donghua had already won a big victory, it seemed too difficult to be unsentimental without treating the guests. In the last five minutes, Feng passed the ball to Chen Hongguang. With a turn, the ball returned to Donghua's territory. When Guan Xun'an was about to kick it out, he suddenly saw Samos rushing forward. He quickly pressed it back, wanting Zhou Xianyuan to send it out. The goal was unexpected and failed to catch it, and it bounced out. Samos came just in time and poked it in, resulting in a score of 4-2.</p>
<p>Donghua Team: Zhou Xianyuan, Li Ning, Guan Xun'an, Tu Kaiyuan, Feng Yunyou, Wu Youliang, Wan Xianghua, Li Yiya, Zai Linjing, Chen Hongguang, Jia Youliang. Laks: Kirkland, Qinsheng, Logan, H. Kirkland, Samos, Migajie, Adige, Baosailie, Notte, H. Fumeida, Tou Tuoman.</p>

<p>Japan wants the puppet state to participate in the Far East Games. Yamamoto has agreed to come to China to lobby. (Nichi Rengo, Tokyo, 3rd) The Japan-Manchukuo Sports Associations invited representatives from the Ministry of Education, the Army, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Central Pavilion in Marunouchi Ward at 5:30 p.m. on the 2nd to discuss the issue of the Manchukuo participating in the Far Eastern Games. The Manchukuo is eager to participate in the conference, but does not want to disrupt the Games. For this reason, the Japan-Manchukuo Sports Associations have decided on a policy to do everything possible to achieve their goal. Yamamoto Tadayoshi, Ph.D., has agreed to be dispatched by the Sports Association. The Manchukuo is also dispatching two commissioners to accompany Yamamoto to China.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Donghua and Jinan to Reunite at the Baseball Field This Afternoon at 3:00 PM <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>There was talk in advance of rescheduling today's Group A soccer match between Donghua and Jinan.</p>
<p>However, because the Western Association urgently wants to end this round of matches, the request was not approved, so the two teams will still play. Donghua lost the first week 2-0. I don't know if they can be competitive today. It will be held at the baseball field starting at 3:00 PM. The schedule is as follows: Donghua vs. Jinan Group A Match, Baseball Field; Laks vs. French Business Group A Match, Racecourse; Executive West Police vs. Shagao Group A Match, Shen Garden; Huiesaer.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Youyou Defeats Shagao Again <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Xi Qiaosheng is More Ferocious Than Before; 5-2; The Battle Situation Is Very Flat. The shell team is the embodiment of Russian expatriates in Group B. Comparing their strength with the strong teams in Group A, it is naturally mediocre. They lost miserably to Youyou by a score of 7-3 before. They met again at the Chinese baseball field yesterday. Connoisseurs said long ago that it would be difficult for the shell team to win. After the battle, the shell team relied more on the courage of one man, without any connection. Therefore, Youyou won 5-2, and it still felt like there was more than enough to spare.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Four Goals in a Row <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>After the start of the game, the rotation was endless. At that time, the Youyou flag was spread all over the enemy's rear defense. Qian Zhongyongsen dribbled the ball north. Although Fan Diwei tried to block him, he was no match for the strong. Zhong still went safely into the center.</p>
<p>Fan Ding's goalkeeper came to catch him, but unexpectedly Xi Aqiao arrived in time and turned around to kick, taking the lead in the record. Soon, Sun Qiushun gained the upper hand in the center, sweeping a kick. The shell team's defenders panicked. The ball was shown and the people had already run out, causing it to bounce off the goalpost and dart into the net. After a few matches, Zhong Yongsen penetrated the border pass, with a very clever cross. Sun Jinshun didn't shoot, but gave it to Qiaosheng, who shot quickly into the net. Liang Shutang added to the splendor, and also scored from 35 yards away, creating a score of 4-0.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Lost Two Goals <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>When things are at their peak, they must decline, which is the nature of numbers. Youyou won four cities in a row without losing a single soldier. Their aura was immense, and their light shone everywhere. Who knew that after Liang Shutang got the ball, the shell team was indignant and determined to take revenge. In three minutes, the five forwards advanced together. Huang Ruihua's two passes fell. Jiang Shanqing broke out of the siege alone, and was planning to turn misfortune into good fortune. Who knew that Burini, who was ambushing in the eastern suburbs, came close to several steps and attacked the goal with force. Tang Yongchun suffered this change, and although he patted the ball skin, it still flew backwards into the net. After the shell team pulled back a goal,</p>
<p>They gained a lot of courage, and charged desperately. Youyou's formation was launched, and Nei Fangchen, Tubu Xiaojie, went to the front line to help defend. He shot low and made another great achievement. After 4-2, the first half ended there.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Fierce Counterattack <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>In the second half, the defense was exchanged, and the shell team, based on their spirit of hard work, continued to threaten Youyou with terrifying attacks. Xi and Mao retreated to the rear defense together to help defend. Liang Shutang wielded his broadsword and axe, Jiang Shanqing blocked east and covered west, and they managed to get 25 minutes each. At this time, the shell team could be said to be in its golden age, and its momentum was unparalleled. It was a pity that their feet were stiff, and they often saw everyone working hard to complete the nine mountains, but failing at the last moment. The hundreds of Russian expatriates outside the field shouted and roared endlessly, but Youyou was determined to defend to the death, and it was difficult to break through their castle.</p>
<h3 id="e196">A Ratio of Five to Two <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Youyou's athletes had been trapped for a long time and wanted to revive. Zhong Yongsen was injured in the foot due to excessive loyalty and bravery, but he was still able to grit his teeth and endure the pain, walking back and forth in the field, and providing considerable assistance to the three strikers in the middle from time to time. Before long, Jiang Shanqing used a crutch to save the ball from danger. At that time, the Russian army was fully mobilized, and there was no one inside to defend. Sun Iron Leg got this good opportunity and dribbled the ball as fast as a galloping horse, marching majestically straight to Huanglong, making the score 5-2. After the match, Chen Jiaqiu mistakenly committed a handball foul and was penalized with a twelve-yard penalty, giving the Russians an excellent opportunity. It was a pity that Wei Halov used too much force, resulting in his failing to score. Soon, in the sound of the Hujia, Youyou returned in triumph.</p>
<p>Youyou Team: Tang Yongchun, Lu Zhiming, Jiang Shanqing, Liang Shutang, Huang Ruihua, Chen Jiaqiu, Wang Shusen, Xi Qiaosheng, Sun Mianpin, Mao Hongfa, Zhong Yongsen</p>
<p>Shell Team: Fan Ding, Fan Diwei, Age Bielaifu, Sitishengfu, Keke Guanmifu, Jie Langshoufu, Bolifu, Wei Halov, Ke Xinghuowulov, Mihalov</p>

Jinan suffered an unprecedented defeat, with French Business winning 9-0. In the first half, French Business scored three goals in a row. In the second half, French Business' momentum was even stronger, galloping freely, and scoring six more goals in a row. It was indeed unexpected.</p>

<p>Electing Representatives to Attend Taxpayer Report Meetings, and Separately Requesting Municipal Associations to Unanimously Demand Regularly Held Primary School Calligraphy Competitions. The Shanghai French Concession Private Primary and Secondary School Association, since its establishment last year, has sought to promote the development of education within the concession.

The municipal authorities have also negotiated with the French authorities, but so far, it has not been realized. The association specially convened an executive committee meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday at the De Run School on Rue Amiral Bayle to discuss how to proceed.

<p>The Labor Union Held an Emergency Representative Congress Yesterday, Submitting a Petition to Party, Government, and Educational Organizations to Prevent It. The Shanghai Fifth District Cigarette Industry Labor Union, recently due to the factory's interference with the administration of workers' children's schools, undermining labor education, has had disputes. At 5:00 PM yesterday, it convened an emergency representative congress to discuss countermeasures and submitted a petition to party, government, and educational organizations, to prevent the factory's illegal behavior. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Emergency Meeting The Fifth District Cigarette Industry Labor Union held an emergency representative meeting at its headquarters at 5:00 PM yesterday. More than one hundred representatives attended. Lu Yinchu, a representative from the municipal party headquarters, and Wang Gang, a representative from the social affairs bureau, publicly elected Chen Peide as chairman and Sun Xiaozhu as recorder. First, the chairman reported on the factory's undermining of the school, followed by resolutions: (1) Petitioning party, government, and educational organizations to prevent the factory's illegal behavior. (2) Issuing a notice to workers. (3) Advising the company's board of directors and factory director. (4) Preventing lackeys from entering the factory to provoke animosity between labor and management. The meeting adjourned after the discussions.</p>
<p>Petition The main points of the union's petition to party, government, and educational organizations are as follows: (1) Article 4 of the school agreement stipulates that the school's administrative finances are the responsibility of both labor and management, and neither party shall directly interfere. During the last winter vacation, the factory notified workers' children that they must register with the factory, which exceeded the scope of the agreement. The union had previously submitted a petition to correct this. This year, students must be admitted with a copper plate issued by the factory, and it is strictly stipulated that only the factory workers’ own children are allowed to attend. All relations such as grandparents and grandchildren, uncles and nephews, brothers, and sisters, are rejected. This has caused the grandchildren of elderly female workers, and the younger siblings and nephews of unmarried female workers and unmarried male workers to have a reason to sigh. The school did not comply, so the factory threatened to cut off funding. Viewing this unreasonable and reckless behavior, it sets a bad precedent in the education field. This is the first point of interfering with school administration and undermining labor education. (2) Since the appointment of Principal Shen Yu in the previous term, he has been enthusiastic about education. Because the factory wanted to place a private individual, it opposed Principal Shen fiercely, hindering him in every way. The private individual they wanted to place was Ge, who had been accused and dismissed by the municipal education bureau. It is even more obvious that they are trying to carry out the will of the other party and carry out illegal actions. This is the second point of interfering with school administration and undermining labor education. (3) The school's funds are customarily received from the factory in two installments each month, which is clearly stated in the old agreement. However, the factory has not yet issued the school's funds for August and September of the previous term, and plans to arbitrarily dispose of them, causing difficulties for the previous board of directors to complete the handover. This is the third point of interfering with school administration and undermining labor education. (4) At the school's board of directors meetings, five factory directors attend, but difficulties arise every time the board's resolutions are implemented. The reason for this is that the factory refuses to comply, resulting in many resolutions being made but not implemented. Therefore, the chairman has the intention of withdrawing, and the school is in danger of disintegration. This is the fourth point of interfering with school administration and undermining labor education. The above points are all recent facts of the factory. The factory claims to want to improve the school, but it is doing the opposite. If they do not want to improve it, it is unknown what kind of state it will reach. The union feels obliged to break its silence and hereby petitions your government to order the factory to cease its illegal behavior immediately, and to appoint an experienced principal to preside over school affairs to maintain education.</p>

<h3 id="e215">Statistics on the Number of Readers in the Municipal Library Over the Past Year <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>Since Xu Zeyi became the director of the Shanghai Municipal Library, he has been actively reorganizing and sparing no effort. He has particularly detailed plans for expanding the circulation group, research room, and reading room. The library currently has more than 20,000 valuable books, 240 kinds of Chinese magazines (including 170 donated), and 31 kinds of Western magazines (including 4 donated). Recently, it has added four volumes of business publications and various famous magazines. In addition to the Oriental Library, it can be regarded as the only library in Shanghai. The library is centrally located and easily accessible. The method of reading books in the library is simple, so the seats are full of people who go to the library to read every day. Xu Zeyi, in view of the insufficient reading room, has applied to the Education Bureau for the allocation of vacant land in Kunlian to build houses to facilitate readers. The following is an exploration of the total number of readers in the library in 1933 and January of 1934. In January 1933, there were 5,518 men, 23 women, for a total of 5,541. In February, there were 5,609 men, 39 women, for a total of 5,648. In March, there were 6,826 men, 46 women, for a total of 6,872. In April, there were 7,916 men, 46 women, for a total of 7,962. In May, there were 8,918 men, 72 women, for a total of 8,990. In June, there were 8,869 men, 81 women, for a total of 8,950. In July, there were 7,772 men, 147 women, for a total of 7,919. In August, there were 6,750 men, 194 women. In September, there were 6,760 men, 65 women, for a total of 6,825. In October, there were 7,828 men, 55 women, for a total of 7,883. In November, there were 7,281 men, 108 women, for a total of 7,389. In December, there were 6,865 men, 35 women, for a total of 6,900. The total number of readers throughout the year was 88,823, of which 44,334 were reading novels and magazines. It is also known that the total number of readers in January of 1934 was 6,403, including 3,668 from the academic community, 68 from the political community, 183 from the industrial community, 1,622 from the business community, 37 visitors, and 831 others.

<h3 id="e216">Bank Society Held Silver Price Discussion Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>Bei Songsun Attended and Gave a Speech The Bank Society held a silver price discussion meeting at the Hong Kong Road Bank Club at 6:30 PM yesterday. More than one hundred members attended, including Xu Peikun, Li Zhaozhao, and Zhu Boquan. Bei Songsun of the National Bank, Gu Jigao of the Zhongfu Bank, and Westerner Kahn were invited to attend. The meeting was chaired by Zhu Boquan. After the meeting, Chairman Zhu reported first, and then introduced Bei Songsun, Gu Jigao, Kahn, and others to speak in succession. They all believed that the US government will raise the price of silver, and its domestic panic is the same as the phenomenon of gold price skyrocketing and silver price plummeting several years ago. However, we are not absolutely opposed to the US government raising the price of silver. If the degree of silver price increase is equal to the degree of price increase, and the silver currency is in a stable state, it is exactly what China is seeking. Now the United States is raising the price of silver in an attempt to dump American goods in other countries, regardless of the issue of prices. This policy will not only fail to succeed, but also affect the Far East trade market. China is a silver-using country, and the only countermeasure at present is to stabilize domestic currency prices, implement a silver export tax, or prohibit silver exports when necessary. Then, members expressed their opinions, and the discussion on the root cause and treatment methods of the silver price problem was very detailed. After the finishing touches are done, the discussion results will be published for the reference of the people of the country.</p>

<p>— Han Yu</p>
<p>Children! Do you have a spirit of creation and experience in creation?</p>
<p>When you are playing with your friends or classmates, can you create other kinds of games besides the usual hide-and-seek and human pyramid to make everyone feel interested? This is the spirit of creation.</p>
<p>Children! Don't underestimate the spirit of creation. Inventors in the world all have a spirit of creation before they can invent things. Edison in the United States was originally a newsboy, but he had a great spirit of creation. So he successively invented the electric light, telephone, and phonograph for us to use.</p>
<p>Children! Now is the time for you to practice the spirit of creation and experience. Don't underestimate the creation of games, because this is the best opportunity to practice the experience of creation. You must use the spirit of creation to cultivate the experience of creation at any time and any place. Then, it is not extremely difficult for you to become an Edison.</p>
<h3 id="e219">About Imitation <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Si</p>
<p>Children, don't you often like to imitate the actions of adults, or imitate the characters in the play after watching a play? Here, I tell you that this is exactly the natural expression of your inner rich imitation. According to research, this imitation is the universal psychology of children, so if your parents or teachers understand child psychology, then they will definitely not interfere or prohibit your actions, because forced prohibition will be harmful to your physical and mental health.</p>
<p>However, children, you should pay attention! The real society is so flawed, and your future is full of traps, so your imitation should be so serious; the actions of adults are not all right, such as smoking, drinking alcohol, gambling, etc., are all unfavorable to you, and even historical figures have many wrong behaviors. Here, you should imitate their strengths and abandon their weaknesses. Naturally, for all imitations, you should carefully consider them beforehand. Imitation is not a bad thing. For example, Japan, although it is a militaristic country and our enemy, its ability to become strong and occupy an important position in the world is also derived from imitating Germany before the European War!</p>

<p>I am very sorry to serve you cold coffee. The host apologized to Franklin.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter!" However, it was just brewed, why did it get cold in a moment? Franklin asked suspiciously.</p>
<p>"Ah, that's because my servant is too lazy." The host replied. "For a long time, this cup has not been cleaned. The color is dark, and the brewed tea is colder than usual."</p>
<p>The host's response gave Franklin another speculation, he thought of the snow pile outside the window.</p>
<p>When he returned home, Franklin covered a piece of white cloth and a piece of black cloth on the snow. After a long time, he opened the two pieces of cloth to see. The snow under the black cloth had melted completely, and the snow under the white cloth had only melted half.</p>
<p>Franklin proved in the experiment the principle that "white repels heat and black absorbs heat."</p>

<p>— Bo Zhen</p>
<p>My little friend in Shanghai, Brother W, it has been several months since I separated from Can last winter, I miss you very much!</p>
<p>In the cold winter weather, all the flowers are withered or dead, only the plum blossoms can stand tall and release fragrant flowers to resist the cruel wind and snow. It is truly worthy of being our national flower!</p>
<p>Our Suzhou Deng Wei has long been famous for producing plum blossoms. Everyone knows the three words "Fragrant Snow Sea." Now, when the plum blossoms are in full bloom, looking from afar, in the middle of a white color like snow, there are many red plum blossoms and green plum blossoms, which reflect each other. It is really pleasing to the eye and refreshing, and the spirit is excited. Generally, literati and elegant scholars all love plum blossoms. Plum blossoms are indeed the best of flowers.</p>
<p>The weather has been warmer recently, and all the flowers have gradually shown a resurrected form, with delicate buds on the branches, and the spring breeze is also very warm. This is a good day for playing!</p>
<p>Where can you find plum blossoms in the city? Even if you can see them in some gardens, I think there are not as many as we have here. I have heard people say that there have been many people going to Deng Wei to explore plum blossoms these past few days. I want to go and play, but it is not very interesting alone, so I want to invite you to go together on Sunday when you are on vacation. I wonder if you have this interest? Wishing you progress in your studies, from your little friend C in Suzhou</p>

<p>— Dong Lin</p>
<p>The pigeon saw the owl living in the same forest busy preparing to relocate, and curiously asked it, "Why are you relocating?" The owl angrily replied, "The people living nearby all hate</p>
<p>my call, so I have to leave here and go somewhere else!" After the pigeon heard its words, it couldn't help but laugh, and advised it, "Wherever you move to, the people nearby will hate your call. Unless you correct your call, relocation is in vain!"</p>
<p>One's own shadow will follow you everywhere. It is a very pitiful act to blame the curvature of the shadow without seeking to correct oneself. However, there are many such people in this world! Children, let us avoid this problem from an early age!</p>
<h3 id="e223">What is the Reason for This? <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Ren Wei</p>
<p>Mom took a blue flower bowl and put it in the center of the table, and put a small copper coin in the bowl, and said to her ten-year-old daughter Lingmei, "Lingmei! you</p>
<p>come over! There is a very fun thing for you to see, and it can also increase your scientific knowledge. Stand next to the table and don't move! Is there anything at the bottom of this bowl?" Lingmei was short, so naturally she couldn't see the copper coin at the bottom of the bowl, so she replied, "Mom! I didn't see anything." Mom said, "There is a coin at the bottom of this bowl, now that you can't see it, it's because your body is too low. But I have a way to make you see the coin at the bottom of the bowl without moving the bowl closer to you, or tilting the bowl, or making your feet stand higher...." Lingmei looked suspicious and said, "Mom, I don't believe it!" Mom smiled and didn't speak, but saw her slowly pouring a bowl of water into the bowl. Strangely, a small copper coin suddenly appeared in Lingmei's eyes.</p>
<p>Lingmei ran over and pinched the corner of Mom's clothes, and asked Mom with a more suspicious look, "What is the reason for this?" Mom gently stroked Lingmei's little hand and said, "Lingmei, I'm giving you this toy"</p>
<p>is to let you know the reason for it. This is because light originally travels in a straight line, but when it passes through water, it changes its straight direction, so adding water makes it possible to see the copper coin at the bottom of the bowl."</p>

<p>Kuang Heng is poor, Kuang Heng is poor, but he studies hard, and the books are always in his hands. Look at the sun setting in the west, a forest of red, and the red light disappears in an instant, and the dark curtain is heavy. The room is as dark as a big hole, you can't see your fingers when you reach out, and you can't tell east from west when you open your eyes. It's also hazy when you go outside. Kuang Heng! He wants to study but can't, who is willing to send the lamp!</p>
<p>It happened that the neighbor was a rich man, lighting the lamp and shining. Kuang Heng thought, and figured it out, so he chiseled a hole in the wall to borrow some light to use. Ah! Borrow some light to use.</p>
<p>Alas! Why don't children with lights study hard?</p>

<p>— Xu Luo</p>
<p>There was a child named Xue Er. When he was born, the doctor told Xue Er's mother not to let Xue Er get close to hot places, because he would die when he got close to hot places. Therefore, Xue Er's mother never allowed Xue Er to get close to hot places. One day, Xue Er insisted that his mother tell him how he was born? The mother said, "Xue Er, you... are part of my body. One day, Mr. Sun dried me, so part of my body turned into very light water vapor and flew into the sky like a bird, playing in the sky every day. One day, it was very cold in the sky, so it turned this water vapor into you</p>
<p>, and Mr. Wind brought it down." Xue Er listened and went to tell the other children.</p>
<p>The other children all liked Xue Er very much, because Xue Er was very beautiful, his face was very white, and his body was very cold, which was different from the rest of the children. Xue Er often caught very bad bugs in the field, so the children's parents also liked Xue Er very much.</p>
<p>One day, the children were all happily dancing around the fire. Xue Er saw it and ran over quickly. But as soon as he got close to the fire, Xue Er died.</p>

<p>— Shao Wen</p>
<p>Children are all very innocent. Their brains are like a blank sheet of paper, with nothing on them. But they all like to work and like to imitate everything they see and hear. This is expressed in their actions as games. Therefore, children's play is the beginning of their acquisition of knowledge. Parents and child educators should pay special attention to children's play life. Educating them in this way is more effective than educating them with textbooks in a rigid way.</p>
<p>In guiding children's play life, the most important thing is to cultivate their scientific knowledge. For example, when they are bouncing a ball, they should be told why the ball will bounce when it is patted on the ground. When they are driving a small car, they should be told some knowledge about cars. As for those boring games that cannot give children any knowledge, they should not be allowed to do them.</p>
<p>Educating children in play life is the best method of child education. We oppose all tendencies to despise children's play.</p>

<p>— Wang Qianchuo</p>
<p>(1) January 3rd Today is my birthday. In the morning, my father wanted to go to the market to buy toys as a birthday gift for me. I said to my father, "Dad! Please don't buy it." My father asked me why? I said, "Because I think of the children in Northeast China, who are now living a painful life, and some can't even get enough to eat, so I don't want to enjoy myself." My father praised me very much after hearing my words.</p>
<p>(2) January 7th Today in botany class, Mr. Xu talked about "tree rings" and said, "We saw a tree trunk, and count the number of rings on it, and we can know how old the tree is." I found this very interesting after hearing this. But I didn't understand the reason, so I asked the teacher again. The teacher said, "The growth of the tree" is entirely due to the sap growing there. The part where the sap is located is in the middle of the bark and the heartwood. The sap surrounds the heartwood and grows, growing a ring every year. These rings are called annual rings. So we count the annual rings of a tree, and we know how old it is." After hearing this, I suddenly understood. It can be seen that as long as you are willing to ask more questions in learning, you will definitely understand.</p>

<p>Little friends, do you have any savings in the bank? Don't you think that only people save money? But if you think so, then you are wrong. Because animals also save money. Now let me tell you a few examples...</p>
<p>1. Bees collect honey from flowers and store it in their hives for when it is cold in winter and they cannot find food.</p>
<p>2. Camels live in the desert, and because it is not easy to find water in the desert, they often store water in the two humps on their backs (or one hump). So even when they cannot find water, it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>The above are two kinds of animals that can save. Below, I will talk about a plant that has the instinct to save.</p>
<p>3. Radishes usually store nutrients little by little in their roots. These roots are the radishes we usually eat, which serve as fertilizer for the seeds to germinate in the future.</p>
<p>Little friends! If there is anything you don't understand or don't believe in what I have said, you can ask your dear parents.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Naughty Wang'er <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>

<h3 id="e231">Animal Sleep <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Student Fan</p>
<p>Little friends, after reading books all day, and playing hard when you are free, aren't you very tired and need to sleep at night? If you are not allowed to sleep, you will definitely feel uncomfortable. Why is this? Because a person's brain cannot be used continuously all day long. After using it all day, it must have several hours of rest. This rest is sleep. However, rest should not be too long. For you children, ten hours of sleep is enough. For adults, eight hours of sleep is enough.</p>
<p>Sleep is not a special need for humans. All kinds of animals need sleep. However, the sleeping state of other animals is very different from that of humans. Like us humans, when we go to sleep, we must sleep on the bed, flat and comfortable. But like horses, when they sleep, they stand on the ground with all four feet, and only close their eyelids. That is sleep. If humans were asked to stand and sleep, they would definitely fall. It is impossible. In addition, like bats, their sleep is even more special. They hang upside down from the beams with their two feet. This is how they sleep. Sleep is originally the most comfortable rest for the body. It is strange that bats hang their bodies upside down, which is considered the most comfortable! As for fish, it is simply impossible to tell what their sleeping state is like. Fish are very alert. As soon as we run to the edge of the fish tank, the fish quickly swim back and forth. Little friends, isn't it?</p>
<p>There are many other animals with particularly strange sleeping habits. I am afraid that this article will be too long, so let's talk about it next time.</p>

<p>— Translated by Li Sheng</p>
<p>ELondonderryNntionnlRfficiencyTheNineteentllCentrfyandatersanrary1934. The author, Ms. Londonderry, is the head of the largest women's organization in modern Britain, the "Women's Army." Although she is only a narrow-minded nationalistic heroine, she has 40,000 organized and strong women who follow her lead. This shows her extraordinary spirit and the great influence on British national defense. This article describes the past and present powerful activities of British women's organizations in national defense, and is clear and interesting. In this autumn of tense international situation, it can serve as a wake-up call for the drunken and dreamy ladies and gentlemen in our country, and can also serve as a mirror for new women with a sense of the times. It can also sweep away the concept of men's contempt for women. Therefore, it is specially translated to enrich this garden. However, due to space constraints, only a few places have been deleted. Translator's note.</p>
<p>World War I and Women. The World War I is liberating women in the belligerent countries from the last economic bondage to men. During the war, they were assigned various important tasks that they had never done before. And no matter how biased against women, one must admit that, in general, they fulfilled their tasks without any regrets. The occupations they engaged in were varied, and often involved complex difficulties that required special training, and they achieved greater success than men expected.</p>
<p>British women engaged in occupations such as nurses, pharmacists, massage therapists, cooks, reporters, military supplies manufacturers, messengers, drivers, etc. Many of them were awarded medals for their contributions. After the war ended, their groups were given words of gratitude by the King, Queen, or Queen. The achievements of British women's training at that time still remain. That is to say, British women are now able to work and have more independence than in any past era. Furthermore, they have a spirit of striving towards machinery and aviation. What is especially gratifying is that the spirit of cooperation has developed due to wartime activities. This spirit is manifested in various aspects of society.</p>
<p>Women and Organizations. Since the war, women have become very outstanding organizers. They exert their powerful influence in deliberative bodies from the Parliament to the village council. In politics, they have shown that they can deal with the necessary attention to detail to achieve success; at election time, they serve as greeters, persuaders, and speakers to exert their abilities. Many of them do city, street, and village leaders, which has greatly won the favor of the people. Especially in terms of their diligence and efficiency, they only exceed men. In higher occupations, since they were promised to join, they have been beneficial and harmless in various places. They now also participate in the affairs of banks and insurance companies. There are also many who work as architects, lawyers,</p>
<p>and doctors. There are also administrative officials and police officers. Women can also be seen in the executives of major newspapers.</p>
<p>Women's professional training. Ms. Pelia, Mullison, and Ge Lai became famous as aviators. Miss Bama Jieli. Fuchs Tu, who is engaged in chicken farming, competed with many men in the Bishi Lai shooting range and won the victory, and won the King's Medal. Mrs. Hainai. Normanton registered as a lawyer belonging to the High Court and fulfilled her duties, proving that married life is not adversely affected by this. There are also many women who serve as judges, and they are especially suitable for judging juvenile cases. They have sympathy and understanding, so they cannot do without them. They serve as visiting judicial officers and are responsible for inspecting the lives and treatment of women in prisons, making great contributions to the country.</p>
<p>Since the war, women have undertaken various tasks as mentioned above. But it will not therefore forget the duty of women as conservatives worry. They will not lose common sense and sound judgment, just as they are working hard to remedy the physical weaknesses that are not as good as men. But most women do not tend to break away from the duties of family duties. I hope to leave the family easily, and I think that such a thing is not easy to do.</p>
<p>The current international relations. Now we cannot ignore the various signs appearing on the international horizon. In many ways, the current situation in Europe is very similar to the scene in early 1914. Although the Geneva International League has tried its best to seek international peace, relations between countries are still extremely tense. The international competition arising from the market competition has turned into political resentment, and this resentment has become more and more fierce due to the competition of armaments. Given the situation, the governments of all countries have trained their citizens in chemical warfare defenses such as the use of gas masks. My friends who recently inspected the two major continental European countries, Germany and the Soviet Union, said that both countries are practicing gas masks. In these two countries, synthetic ammonia and nitric acid are being vigorously manufactured under the name of fertilizers. Naturally, once in wartime, these items will be used to manufacture explosives and toxic gases, especially tear gas and blistering gas. The Soviet Union often uses airplanes to spread mobile fertilizers, which can also be used in combat, needless to say.</p>
<p>Women's organizations. Now no one wants a brutal war to occur, but at the same time no one can guarantee that it will not occur. At this moment, it is necessary to add some investigation to women's groups that have a close relationship with national defense. There are two women's bodies in Britain that deserve special attention. One is purely medical (the Association of Volunteer Women), and the other is the "Women's Army," which has a broad social mission. The latter is held by myself as chairman.</p>
<p>The Association of Volunteer Women was originally named TdeOrganizationofvoluntaryAidinEnglandandWales (British and Welsh Association of Volunteer Women), and was established in 1909 with the assistance of the War Department. The original purpose was to serve as a local medical institution in the country during wartime, and later it was sent abroad to assist the medical affairs of the Army, Navy and Air Force. When war was declared in 1914, the British</p>
<p>The Red Cross and the St. John's Association recruited as many as 2,000 detachments, with more than 70,000 personnel, and the number increased by half when the war began. Since 1923, its scope of activities has been further expanded. Now there are trained staff such as nurses, pharmacists, wireless telephone technicians, massage therapists, practical assistants, and opticians. There are ordinary cooks, clerks, and trainee nurses who are not yet mature in training. They are also divided into mobilized and non-mobilized classes. The mobilized class consists of women between the ages of twenty-one and forty, who are widely engaged in medical care and nursing for the national army at home and abroad in wartime. Their compulsory subjects are the theory and practice of nursing. The optional subjects are chemical warfare defense, hygiene, tropical hygiene, cooking, and childcare. Now, especially for the aforementioned reasons, special attention is paid to chemical warfare defense. Recently, an air rescue organization has been added. There are now three air ambulance classes. The Women's Legion (TheWomensleaion) was founded by me in 1915, and its purpose is to replace men who take up arms and go to the military for the country's benefit in times of crisis. Members wear yellowish-brown uniforms and receive regular and strict training. As many as 40,000 people have registered. I initially wanted them to engage in farming. Although farmers welcomed them, mocking anonymous letters were received from all sides at the time. Most of them said that the plan was simply ridiculous, and some said that the appearance of women marching in the streets in men's clothing</p>
<p>, It's too weird. The purpose of the patriotic women of the military country is not to form a team of martyrs or women's volunteer army. Women should do their duty to the country.</p>
<p>Tasks, not to replace men, do what men should do. Women are women, and they should not imitate men from places different from men. But there are many tasks that women should do for the country. The reason why I named it a women's army is because the term LEGION reminds me of the efficiency and training of the ancient Roman army. This is by no means from the perspective of the army. I think it should be regarded as the basis of a national life. In my mind, I feel that a trained and powerful women's state</p>
<p>Exist everywhere. From the beginning, I opposed the idea that all the work of women is compulsory. Therefore, in addition to organizers, committee members, and propagandists, I do not use voluntary personnel. I have always held the doctrine of replacing male labor with female labor. In order to maintain the necessary control and the high standard of operation, it is extremely necessary to pay the</p>
<p>Appropriate remuneration or handling fee is extremely necessary. This is what the members appointed by the Ministry of Military Affairs in November 1916 also considered necessary. They said that until the end of the war, about 80% of the labor in the United Kingdom was done by paid female workers.</p>
<p>The Women's Army and related groups. The Women's Army has made many contributions to the country during the war. The parent body of the side branches of the group. Those that can be called her detachments include the Women's Land Army, the Queen Manling Assistance Team, the Women's Navy, and the Women's Air Force. The main tasks of the Women's Army during the war were transportation, employment, cooking, etc. Later, the cooking aspect was taken over by the Queen Manling Assistance Team.</p>
<p>In addition to these military-related groups, the Women's Army also has detachments for all operations that women must perform, such as farming. However, they are doing their best to handle the most important operations such as transportation, such as the transportation of goods and wounded soldiers, and even the use of messengers. After the war ended, the Chief Accountant, Sha, John. Cowan praised the Women's Army's Transportation Department and said, "Without their help, the transportation work could not have been so complete and quick. Now they have become an indispensable element of the army." The Women's Army's Automobile Department still exists as a reserve transportation department.</p>
<p>The plan to create a new women's group. When necessary, women's groups can be expanded as much as possible. As recently reported in the newspapers, Commander Yaling wanted to organize a new group called the Women's Reserve Army. The purpose is to train the necessary wartime matters such as life-saving, defending against poison gas, cooking, and transportation. However, this seems to be repeating and conflicting with the work of existing groups.</p>
<p>The reform of existing groups. Therefore, I have to oppose the plan to organize new women's groups related to military affairs and advocate reforming existing groups, placing them under strict control, giving them new vitality, and dividing operations according to the scope of work to be done in the future. Now, it is the most appropriate time to transform the Women's Army to contribute to the country in the future. I think it is especially necessary to hold cooking lectures all over the country and train women in the knowledge and skills of chemical warfare defense, machinery management, and transportation and messengers of the Navy, Army, and Air Force.</p>
<p>Local activities. During wartime, there is a lot of assistance from women in cities and local areas. And the activities of women's groups are more convenient based on local areas. This will never conflict with the activities of the existing Red Cross, St. John's Association or branches of such groups. Because the Women's Army has far more members than any other women's group, it can cooperate with various groups as needed to perform the tasks of women for the national army. Lessons from the Great War. If there had been a fully trained women's assistance group when the Great War broke out in 1914, then there would have been no need to be so hasty. The situation of hastily recruiting nurses across the country, holding cooking lectures, and mixing up and down is still fresh in our memories. All of these require full preparation in peacetime. We have learned a great lesson from the Great War, and it is not okay to forget this lesson.</p>
<p>For the sake of national security, it is necessary for women to continue to receive the training they received during the war. These experiences should now be inherited by younger sisters. It is also the duty of women to do their best, individually or collectively, to protect the country in times of national crisis. Any country, when it is in danger of survival, is not enough to rely on the power of men alone, and a total national mobilization should be carried out. Then it is absolutely necessary for women to prepare actively, implement full training and organization in peacetime.</p>
<h3 id="e233">Madame Sanger, a World-Famous Woman <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Xue Wen</p>
<p>In 1922, a woman who advocated birth control came to our country, China. She was Madame Sanger, who went everywhere to promote a theory of protecting motherhood.</p>
<p>Her proposition of birth control, on the one hand, is to prevent excessive population, and on the other hand, is to protect the freedom of motherhood. According to her, it can save crime, famine, war, etc. in society, so it is also a method of improving society. Her various life situations from childhood to middle age are worth knowing. The following is a brief description:</p>
<p>(1) Childhood. She was born in Corning, New York. Her father was a sculptor full of imagination, and her mother gave birth to eleven children in total. She was the fifth child, and the family was not very wealthy in terms of economy in order to enable their children to achieve their aspirations for schooling.</p>
<p>When she was young, she often received strict teachings from her father. For example, "A person must have his own idea. For this ideal, we must make great efforts." So when he taught children, he often said, "You must have a dream or illusion now, and you must strive to realize that dream in the future." Madame Sanger often received such inspiration, so she knew the trend of life early in her childhood.</p>
<p>She also had a habit of taking care of people when she was a child. For example, when she saw sick cats and other domestic animals, she always</p>
<p>She went to treat them with all her heart. She was like a mother to the homeless children nearby, advising them not to cause trouble. When her companions were injured while playing, she went to wrap up the injured fingers. In short, she was like a nurse.</p>
<p>At that time, she also discovered a tragic fact, that is, many playmates, if they obtained labor certificates, would leave home and go to the factory to work. She carefully studied and knew that they could no longer receive education and had to go to the factory because there were younger siblings in the family and their parents were under economic pressure.</p>
<p>(2) Girlhood. After that, she boarded at a school to study. In this era, she liked sports very much, such as basketball, dancing, etc. She participated enthusiastically. There were more than 500 people in that school, and she and her classmates did various extracurricular activities. The most enthusiastic one was practicing speeches.</p>
<p>Once, she decided to give a speech on the necessity of women's suffrage, but when she practiced, she was ridiculed by her classmates.</p>
<p>, So it was very difficult. So, good secretly ran to</p>
<p>She spoke by herself, pointing and gesturing, in a place far away from the school. At this time, the audience and the lecturer were all her own. Later, she spoke in public at the assembly, which attracted everyone's attention. As a result, a group for the suffrage movement was organized. At that time, she was only fourteen years old.</p>
<p>Later, she went to New York Hospital to study for four years and graduated from the Medical Research Department. She liked internal medicine and nursing. In these four years, she witnessed the pain of production and death, so a kind of power was added to her thoughts.</p>
<p>(3) After marriage, after her medical studies ended, she married Sanger, who was studying art.</p>
<p>After her marriage, she continued to engage in nursing, which continued for fourteen years. During these many years, she witnessed that poor families suffered from having many children and were trapped in tragic</p>
<p>In the situation of a bitter life, therefore, she gradually felt that the necessary conditions for women's liberation were really a healthy body. No matter how lofty the ideal is, if one becomes a mother, nothing can be realized. Good also saw a poor woman who prevented pregnancy with a non-scientific method, but died of poisoning as a result. Therefore, she firmly believed that birth control must have scientific methods. In 1914, she promoted her propositions to the general public.</p>
<p>However, during her propaganda period, she was repeatedly accused. Once she was arrested and imprisoned, and she was released after many people tried to rescue her. There are more than 20 propaganda agencies she established in her country. She came to Asia for propaganda in 1922. When she arrived in Japan, she was initially stopped</p>
<p>, Later forced her not to preach that she could not land on the island, and arrived in our country from Japan, and gave several lectures in Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and other places.</p>
<h3 id="e234">The Meaning of New Women <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>Women account for half of mankind, and the other half are men. Originally, these two halves of mankind lived in the same society, and no problems would arise except for mutual production and mutual distribution. However, due to differences in living techniques and the heavy shackles of the patriarchal society built over thousands of years, women have come to be regarded as half of mankind that has become a problem today. The so-called "women's problem" that we hear today is really a great shame to the women's world as it is discussed and studied like "Jewish problem," "black slave problem" and special ethnic minority issues.</p>
<p>The common so-called "women's problem" is the problem of women's economic life. For thousands of years, the position of women in society has been a parasitic position. Because of the differences in living techniques, women can do nothing for society except to serve their husbands, take care of children, and handle family affairs. The economic life of society is completely controlled by men, while women lose their independence. But this kind of life can only be stable in the feudal society for thousands of years. When social changes occur at the same time as the changes in social economy, this kind of life must be eliminated. The so-called "women's problem" that we are discussing today is just occurring at the present stage when the huge feudal society is collapsing and the parasitic class is generally shaking. It does not occur at the stage when women were bought and sold as commodities in the heyday of feudal society. It especially proves that the women's problem is not a separate problem, but one of the overall social transformation problems. The solution to the women's problem cannot be solved alone. It must be solved in the overall solution of the social problem. The actual effect of the solution.</p>
<p>The status of women is indeed so unfortunate as determined by society and "innateness," but women themselves have destroyed their position in society, and the whole line has escaped from the ranks of independent life. Obviously, it should be blamed on women themselves. Let's take a look at the facts. We cannot understand the meaning of her existence in society and give up her obligation to fight for independent life. There are still many women who are willing to make a living under the slavery of men, and these women are especially all intellectual class and the bourgeois class, who claim to be enlightened. We must now re-estimate the definition of new women. New women must not only break free from the slavery of men in the family and become an important member, but also strive for social status and become an important member of society. These two are linked.</p>
<p>The responsibility for women's liberation rests on women themselves, and also on women's participation in actual social life and cooperative overall solutions to social problems.</p>
<h3 id="e235">Glimpses of Working Women's Lives <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Spring has arrived! A group of people with hopes of getting rich still have to live a life where it is difficult to get rich. Hundreds of thousands of working women, from spring to winter, from morning to night, from the countryside to the city, from home to the factory, who isn't busy because of the oppression of life? But people can only lightly know that they work for life, and often ignore how noteworthy and serious their lives under labor are.</p>
<p>No one can deny that human survival has many necessary conditions in life, such as rest, entertainment, hygiene, education... Especially for women, attention to physiological development in childhood, protection of maternal health in adulthood, and so on. Unfortunately, our female compatriots in the labor world are too far away from human life.</p>
<p>Workshops filled with the deafening roar of mechanical movements, rows of dim, pale yellow electric lights, sleepy-eyed, puffy-faced, weak-limbed women with dull eyes, either yawning while working in cotton mills or dozing off while working in silk mills, work from 6:00 PM to 6:00 AM the next morning. When the dancers are tired, the flying birds are also weary, the east is turning white, and the cars begin to move on the rails, they can then leave the huge factory in groups with heavy legs, dragging their limp bodies, braving the piercing wind, and return to their low and narrow homes. Then, feeding their children, cooking, doing needlework, washing clothes... At night, the suckling infants have to be carried around, subjecting their fragile nerves to the stimulation of the deafening sounds of the machines, and their weak respiratory organs breathe in large amounts of dirty air. If they are lucky, they can suckle their mother's nutrient-deficient milk and slowly grow up. "Life is hard in this life, we have to cultivate for the next life," a cotton mill worker in the dusty air of the workshop, takes out the cold leftover rice brought from home in a lunchbox, soaks it in the unfiltered hot water from the factory's hot water pipe, and swallows the pickled radish while explaining to her companion the reason for eating vegetarian food, even though they don't look at small fish and shrimps. If someone eats two salted duck eggs brought from home in a meal, this will attract everyone's attention and be surprised at how wasteful it is. Their usual vegetables are mostly stir-fried beans, pickled radish, soybean sprouts, pickled mustard greens, etc. Eating green vegetables and tofu is too expensive. Indeed, with their income, they naturally cannot eat better food, let alone whether the quality of the food meets the needs of the human body, not to mention that there are many working women who are waiting for a vegetarian meal.</p>
<p>Spring has arrived, the warmth of the spring breeze and the beauty of the spring scenery are enough to inspire people's wisdom, cultivate people's temperament, and invigorate people's spirit. Of course, nature is not biased and equally benefits working women, but they are not blessed to enjoy it. They don't ask about the flowers of spring, the moon of autumn nights, nor do they care about the rain of summer or the snow of winter. They just mechanically walk into the factory like ghosts under the streetlights every day, and suffer the heat attack of water vapor and car oil gas in the tall workshop without seeing the sun. Their mechanical life and fixed environment do not require any wisdom or thought. They only know that the price of rice has risen, and that wages have been reduced. When they get off work, they still walk home like ghosts under the streetlights.</p>
<h3 id="e236">Women's Garden's Current Work <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Mao Rui</p>
<p>In this tense and screaming atmosphere of natural disasters, man-made disasters, and national crises, suddenly our women's mentor is born to awaken the dreaming women of China. This is the gospel of our women's world, and also the gospel of the country and society! Everyone knows that since the "May Fourth" Movement, Chinese society has been filled with slogans of women's liberation, inheriting the legacy of European and American women's movements, but looking at the Chinese women's world today, has it been liberated to the path of light? A portion of knowledgeable women have already run from the countryside to the cities, running towards the path of modernization, dreaming sweet dreams of "love" and intoxicating the souls of the general youth.</p>
<p>In the countryside, most of the women are still oppressed and numb.</p>
<p>The result of Chinese women's liberation is the creation of many female customers who sell goods from the East and Southeast Asia, and characters in romance dramas. What we uniquely hope from the Women's Garden today is to awaken the modernized women of China and lead them to the countryside to awaken the women in the majority of rural areas who are oppressed and living the lives of cattle and horses. Let us all walk towards the bright road of women, to wash away the stain of modern Chinese women. This is the most urgent work in our Women's Garden!</p>

<p>Yesterday's Chinese Securities Exchange saw a slight reduction in transactions, and the market was tired, and the market was quite lethargic. On the habit of the delivery market, it is easy to small again.</p>
<p>Observing the state of the market price revolving over the past three days, the afternoon of each day has slightly revived the wind. At first, it returned to four or five jiao, then it only returned to two or three jiao, and finally it was only five points or one jiao. The trend is that the power of the return wind is weakening day by day, and the total number of small returns is only a few jiao to one yuan. According to the general observation, small plates are more common. However, if there is a large decline in the future, the return will inevitably be great. Even if it revolves for a few more days, the result will still change the situation, which should be discussed separately. In the opening market yesterday morning, large accounts continued to sell out, and the market price continued to be small by two or three jiao. The second plate was still devoid of spirit, generally due to more sporadic supply, and continued to be small by one or two jiao. Starting from the distant salt tax, it was slightly stable and slightly better by five points. Most of the people on the table were intent on suppressing the small. The afternoon gradually became chaotic, and the opening market price was low. The number was only one or two jiao. The closing trend was still sluggish, and retail investors continued to sell in succession, and the market price fell more and rose less. The market sentiment was still unable to cheer up. The market price results, 96 whole six gold long and distant 19 after the event, were slightly better by one or two jiao, and the rest continued to fall by about one or two jiao to three or four jiao.

<h3 id="e246">Wheat Flour Prices: Morning Decline, Afternoon Rebound <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market for each month showed a trend of initial stability followed by a decline. Due to the recovery in foreign wheat prices, with Chicago rising by five to six cents and Canada rising by about five cents, people were initially calm when the prices opened. However, as the bulls sold off and various factories gradually released their holdings, people became extremely weak again. For a time, selling was very active and market prices fell sharply. For example, the price for this month fell to as low as two yuan and four cents, and the price for June fell to as low as two yuan, one cent, and two and a half mills, a drop of twelve cents compared to the previous day. These low prices are a new record for this year. When the market opened in the afternoon, it was initially stable, but then gradually rebounded. Because the market was short, there was covering. After three sessions, there were rumors that the conflict between Japan and Russia was likely to become serious, so buying interest surged again. Whether this was a short squeeze is currently difficult to determine. As a result, the price for this month improved slightly by two and a half mills, the price for April and May remained unchanged, the price for June and July decreased slightly by five mills, and the price for August decreased slightly by seven and a half mills.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning and afternoon, the market was relatively calm because the quoted prices for foreign wheat from Chicago and Canada had recovered by about five or six cents. In the near term, the market conditions tended to stabilize because the inventory of local wheat was not abundant and factories seemed to be holding back supply. However, for the distant months, the market was somewhat affected by the dumping of foreign wheat and the gradual decline in flour prices. The price for June fell to as low as three yuan and fifty-eight cents. The afternoon was slightly better. The price for July and August was consistently weak. As a result, the price for April improved slightly by two cents, the price for June improved by one cent, the price for July decreased slightly by two cents, and the price for August decreased slightly by three cents. The current wheat market price is stable and factory demand is still good. Bengbu wheat opened at three yuan, three cents, and eight cents, then fell to three cents and four cents. Xuzhou wheat was three yuan and four and a half cents. It is said that Fufeng and Huafeng purchased a total of 2,800 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e248">Rice Prices Fluctuate <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the supply of rice from various sources to southern Shanghai was relatively abundant, with nearly 40 boats arriving (over 5,000 piculs). Late rice and various types of thick japonica rice each accounted for half. Customers from other provinces were actively purchasing late rice. As merchants from Tianjin and other places began to enter the market, the situation became tense, and sellers took the opportunity to raise prices, making the market seem to be on the rise. However, because buyers were unable to relax their grip, the price of over 2,000 bags of late rice from Qingjiao, Songjiang, Xisha and Lian areas rose by only five or six cents. However, judging from the trend, it seems to be changing. If the rise can continue for several days, there may be a turning point, given the domestic stockpiling. The market for various types of thick japonica rice was weak due to a decline in demand from shops. Fortunately, daily accumulation was not abundant, so there was no significant decline. For example, only the medium-grade Su Tong japonica rice fell slightly by five cents, while the high-grade rice was able to hold steady. However, the price of Changbang japonica rice fell by five cents to nearly one foot for both high and low grades due to limited sales channels. Due to the small amount of early rice arriving in Nanhang, the market showed a positive trend. Yangjian rice was still affected by the customer's sharp increase and fell by about ten cents. Dujian rice did not experience much change. Yinbian yuan rice supply exceeded demand, causing the price to fall by ten cents.</p>
<p>(Northern Shanghai) Approximately 27 or 28 boats arrived with various goods. The market saw a slight increase in demand. Premium grade broken japonica was stable, and lower-grade rice strengthened. Baiyuan early thin rice and Dujiangjian rice prices were stable. High-grade Yangjian rice was scarce and rose slightly by several cents, while medium and lower grades were stable and weak.</p>

<p>Grain has always been the main export commodity from northern Shanghai, with flour being the most widespread. Since the end of the lunar month, merchants from various provinces have stopped purchasing due to year-end closing of accounts. Since the beginning of the New Year, most merchants from other provinces have not yet entered the market, resulting in no transactions. A large amount of flour was purchased by northern merchants the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the Yihua Guisheng ship transported 14,000 bags of flour to Yantai and Tianjin. Yesterday, the Taikoo Shengjing ship sailed to Tianjin, fully loaded with over 60,000 bags of flour and only a few hundred bags of rice. It is said that the Yihua Dingsheng ship will also export a large batch of flour to Tianjin next Monday.</p>
<p>The price of Niuzhuang soybean oil in the oil market fell by one and a half yuan. Yesterday, the price of soybean oil suddenly fell sharply. Traders were afraid of a major change after a long period of decline, so they opened a large market yesterday. However, sales were still limited to routine transactions. It is estimated that 1,600 units of Dalian oil were opened by ship (including goods for listening to the market), with a price of 9 yuan and 8 jiao, a sharp drop of 1 yuan and 1 jiao compared to the opening price. 700 units of Qishan oil were opened by ship, with a price of 9 yuan and 8 jiao, a drop of 9 jiao. 200 units of Qishan oil were opened by sand boat, with a price of 9 yuan and 8 jiao and a half, also a drop of 9 jiao. 150 units of Qishan Shahe oil were opened by ship, with a price of 10 yuan and 8 jiao, also a drop of 9 jiao. 300 units of Niuzhuang oil were opened by ship, with a price of 10 yuan and 7 jiao and a half, a significant drop of 1 yuan and 4 jiao and a half. 300 units of Niuzhuang oil were also opened by sand boat, with a price of 10 yuan and 8 jiao, a sharp drop of 1 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>

<p>Every spring, Jiangxi tung oil merchants and customers negotiate the opening prices in Zhenjiang because the new goods are about to be listed. The prices of various brands have been negotiated and the market has opened. Regular Hong oils such as Jichanghe and Jiyingfeng, and Deputy Hong oils such as Qingyuanfeng, Yanghengyuan, Liutongqing and Xurongchang are being negotiated. Shanghai merchants purchase from Zhenjiang for about 4,000 to 5,000 barrels. However, Zhenjiang sells not only to Shanghai but also to Jiangbei, Suzhou, and other places, so the total number must be collected from all places. It is expected that sales numbers will be announced next week. However, sales this year may not be as strong as last year, and the amount of the first trading session is not expected to exceed last year, which can be foreseen. As new goods have arrived in Jinan in succession, Shanghai merchants will also begin wholesale sales. The price of Jichanghe for Regular Hong oil is around 27 yuan per barrel, Jiyingfeng is 26 yuan and 6 jiao, Yanghengyuan and Qingyuanfeng for Deputy Hong oil are still 23 yuan and 2 jiao, and Liutongqing and Xurongchang are around 23 yuan. Jifeng and Yingxiangtaifeng have been open for a long time, and the price is still 20 yuan and 4 or 5 jiao, and sales seem to be more focused on Xiangyun.</p>

<p>Yesterday, sugar market trading was light due to it being Sunday. The clearing price of No. 24 coarse sugar was still quoted at 19 yuan and 7 jiao. No. 9 Hekeng was 15 yuan and 8 jiao. Taikoo B mark was 20 yuan and 1 jiao and 5 cents. Local factory refined white sugar was 18 yuan and 7 jiao, slightly less than five cents.

Yesterday, over 1,000 bags were sold again, with prices such as 11 yuan and 8 jiao for the first grade and 11 yuan and 5 or 6 jiao for Huanggangqing. Longjiangqing was particularly popular, with a sudden increase of 2 or 3 jiao to 10 yuan and 7 jiao and 5 cents and 10 yuan and 8 jiao. It is heard that the seller will not accept offers below 11 yuan in subsequent transactions. Based on market trends, this may be possible. Zhuqing also rose by 2 or 3 jiao to 10 yuan and 8 jiao due to the influence of Chaoqing, with over 100 bags sold. It is reported that a batch of Chaoqing was transported by the Yihua Yisheng ship of the Yihua Company a few days ago, totaling 1,877 bags, and there are also about 500 bags of transshipment goods.</p>
<h3 id="e252">Northern and Southern Goods: Jinshan Longan Prices Rise <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>Guangdong Jinshan longan's reserves are not abundant, and the supply is not plentiful. The market trend is strong. A few days ago, Guangdong merchants offered over 600 boxes, with prices ranging from 65 or 6 yuan to 55 yuan. Shifeng's sun-dried longan had the best color and fragrance, opening at 80 yuan, an increase of 1 to 3 yuan compared to before the holiday. Xinjing soaked longan was also offered at the same time with over 800 boxes, with prices ranging from 40 yuan and 5 jiao to 14 yuan. The situation was stable. It is heard that Jian merchants' soaked longan will open their prices today.</p>
<p>Seaweed and Western Tapioca Flour Affected by Eastern Goods. Western tapioca flour has recently been affected by the influx of Eastern flour, resulting in inconsistent market prices. Compared to the initial price, it has fallen by more than one jiao, and sales have suddenly stagnated, with only a few retail customers. Therefore, over 100 bags were opened in the market today, with prices ranging from 10 yuan and 5 jiao and 5 cents to 10 yuan and 5 jiao. However, people still expect further declines. Ningbo Changjiang merchants have suddenly stopped selling due to water transport costs, and market prices have fallen by 1 or 2 yuan per dan.</p>
<h3 id="e253">Metal: Eastern White Iron Prices Frequently Decline <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>Eastern white iron prices have been declining recently. According to market surveys, this is due to the excessive amount of goods arriving. For example, the price of a 36-inch sheet is only 8 jiao and 7 cents (the price sold by Eastern trading companies), while the market price is 9 jiao and 1 or 2 cents. Large-scale transactions are also only sold for about 8 jiao and 8 or 9 cents. The price of a 37-inch sheet is 1 yuan, 4 cents, and 5 cents. For large purchases, the price can be as low as 1 yuan, 2 cents, or 3 cents. Transactions are more active than for 36-inch sheets. However, too many goods have arrived from Eastern small trading companies recently, which has also affected the market a lot. According to reports from the same merchants selling this product in the market, the future market situation is still very pessimistic due to the manipulation of Japanese and Russian bosses.</p>

<h3 id="e261">The Economic Value of "Economic Wife" <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— But Ling</p>
<p>Considering the standards by which most people choose a wife, the most important are nothing more than these few points:</p>
<p>(1) "Youth," with youth to the level of "sweet sixteen" and "budding years" being the most satisfying degree;</p>
<p>(2) "Beauty," with the beauty of a goddess, "flower-like countenance," and "delightful appearance" being the highest ideal; in addition, such things as "gentle disposition," "sound physique," and similar social standing are also some of the important conditions. As for whether this wife can help her husband in production, or whether she can be economically self-reliant, this point is generally not given much attention.</p>
<p>Having a "wife" at home who only knows how to consume and does not engage in production is, of course, not a problem for wealthy men. Not to mention one, even having three wives and four concubines is like buying a few more toys, a few mannequin-like foreign dolls; there is never no place to put them. In the event that the wives and concubines become "uneasy in their positions" and "fight" each other, there is also a method of "dismissal." As long as good luck shines, all the man's land, housing, capital, and industry will continue to grow; the tens of thousands of yuan in dismissal fees for wives and concubines is merely a drop in the ocean compared to the total assets and is not something to worry about.</p>
<p>However, for men in the middle class and below, such a "wife" is difficult to cope with. Originally, it is not an easy thing for a person who "lives from hand to mouth," or who "cannot even get to the mouth from the hand," or even who "has a hand but no way to get to the mouth," to be able to marry a wife; some may have already spent a small capital. They cannot even maintain their own personal lives, and after marrying a wife, they have to support her like worshiping a bodhisattva. I ask, can the family economy not accelerate towards bankruptcy?</p>
<p>As the society becomes more and more depressed, a person without an economic backing has already been deprived of the qualification to marry a wife, but if he must take a risk, to taste the flavor of the fragrant, to avoid the butcher's door of the salted meat shop and gorge himself, then, I think it is best for him to vigorously pursue a working woman, to pursue a woman who can be diligent, thrifty, and hardworking, and who can engage in production. It is not necessary to insist on youth and beauty, nor is it necessary to ask whether she is a virgin or a widow. Of course, the kind of woman I am talking about does not necessarily refer to something like a "talented student from a certain girls' school." What I mean is that she must have at least a skill, and be able to support herself. But if she has received higher education, and at the same time can indeed provide her husband with strong help in terms of economy, then that is naturally the best. I have no name for such a wife, but I name her "economic wife," because she is as cheap and good as "economic vegetables."</p>
<p>However, one thing we must pay attention to is that the rights and obligations between wife and husband are equal. While the wife should help the husband materially, the husband should also strive to share the wife's labor and should not have the idea of ​​getting something for nothing and enjoying the fruits of others' labor. Because the wife is not a money tree after all, and the husband is not a capitalist, and cannot regard her as a wage laborer and exploit and squeeze her. Whether wife or husband should have such a understanding, that is: the family is like a small-scale cooperative, and she and he are shareholders in this society, and they should stand on the meaning of mutual assistance to produce and consume together.</p>
<p>The era of treating a wife with bound feet as a carved work of art has now passed. The views of praising love as sacred, being amazed by modern wives as heavenly gods, or regarding them as beautiful vases, these idealistic and aesthetic points of view are now also about to become inapplicable. In this era, wives have gradually become practical goods. On the one hand, society needs her to be an engine to promote social progress, and on the other hand, the husband also needs her to be his oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, rice, and society is the same to her husband.</p>
<p>However, coming back to the point. In the current situation in China, which is caught in the whirlpool of economic panic and where industry is backward, women's occupations are not developed, and the number of working women is extremely limited. Whether every man can marry a working woman as a wife, and whether every working woman is willing to marry a poor man, has indeed become a very big question. In addition, as the panic of unemployment deepens, even many men cannot find work to do, let alone women? Therefore, even if some people can marry working women as wives, whether the couple can often have work at hand is still a question. Taking a step back, even if they can have a relatively long-term occupation, whether the salary or wages they earn can solve their minimum living needs is still very difficult to say. In this way, "economic wives" are indeed not easy to obtain, even if you are lucky enough to obtain one, the result is probably still not very economical. As for the future, once there are little babies, the heavy burden on the family will naturally be expected. No matter how you control fertility, this group of "little troublemakers," this group of small "uninvited guests," may sometimes still intrude. This is like eating "economic vegetables," after paying for the food and drink, sometimes you have to pay a tip as well.</p>
<p>Therefore, if a man cannot afford to marry a wife, or if he is deeply afraid that marrying a wife will increase the burden of life and be unable to cope, then I still hope that he will violate his instincts and embrace celibacy. Otherwise, he can only use the methods I mentioned above as a last resort. Of course, if the wife of your dreams is a rich girl, that is naturally even better, but this depends on your environment and whether you have sufficient conditions to make her satisfied, otherwise you can't get her!</p>
<p>One last sentence: Although an "economic wife" may not necessarily live up to her name, a prostitute in a brothel is out of the question, because that is not only not very economical, but also a bit unhygienic; that is simply a multi-treasure wife!</p>
<h3 id="e262">"Too Old," "Too Young," "Just Right"—Three Laundry Women <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Bi</p>
<p>This day was my first day working in the town. At breakfast, the office was changed to a dining hall. A head peered in from outside the dining hall, a middle-aged woman nearing forty.</p>
<p>"Sir, do you have any clothes to change today?" "No! No! No!" My colleague Old Zhang repeatedly spat out his disgusted reply.</p>
<p>"Sir! Let this old woman wash a few pieces, won't you? I may be old, but I still wash clothes clean. "She still wanted to salvage her fate.</p>
<p>"No!" Old Zhang was knocking on the table with his bamboo chopsticks. Disappointed, she glanced at me and rekindled her new hope.</p>
<p>"This newly arrived gentleman, do you have any?"</p>
<p>"No, I just changed them the day before yesterday," I replied honestly.</p>
<p>"Go away! Annoying! Muttering about what? Even if we have clothes, we wouldn't let you wash them." Old Zhang's face became a bit ugly.</p>
<p>After we ate our porridge, the middle-aged woman left. I was just about to ask Old Zhang, but he earnestly said to me first, "Old Yan, don't let that old woman wash your clothes from now on. There's a younger one here who washes well. She always comes here in the evening."</p>
<p>I gave him a smile. At night, the office turned into a night chat session.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>The door was closed, and the tall kerosene lamp cast an orange-yellow light. The documents on the desk had long been sleeping soundly in the drawer. At this moment, the table was filled with oranges, peanuts, and, of course, tea and cigarettes.</p>
<p>My colleagues were chatting about everything under the sun, and I recalled Old Zhang's words from the morning.</p>
<p>"In the first month, I think of my love, my love is like the New Year..." There was a faint female voice singing a spring tune, the sound waves coming from afar and approaching.</p>
<p>As it got closer, it seemed to be just outside the office door. "The flirt is here!" Old Zhang exclaimed with a humorous report.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the office door was pushed open, and a young woman of twenty-one or two appeared in the orange-yellow light.</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, have you had your supper?" Her eyes swept over the colleagues with a charming smile. "We've eaten," came the unanimous reply. After a brief greeting, she scurried off to the dormitory, rummaging through everyone's beds. Old Zhang followed closely behind.</p>
<p>"Ask for clothes properly, don't rummage around!"</p>
<p>"There's a secret in the quilt." Her voice was a bit oily.</p>
<p>"What secret?"</p>
<p>"Last night I dreamed of you..." "Bah! You bad seed, watch out for a slap." Her voice was a bit coquettish.</p>
<p>"XXXXXXXXXX"</p>
<p>"Don't get handsy."</p>
<p>When she came back out of the dormitory, she was carrying a large pile of clothes, at least six or seven sets. Four sets belonged to Old Zhang, and the rest belonged to two other colleagues. They were piled high on Old Zhang's desk.</p>
<p>Perhaps because there was a stranger like me present this evening, she didn't act too flirtatious in the office.</p>
<p>She sorted the clothes briefly, tucked them under her left arm, and said, "See you all tomorrow," then opened the door and left.</p>
<p>"In the first month, I think of my love, my love is like the New Year." Her voice bounced outside the door again.</p>
<p>Old Zhang seemed to remember something, and he also opened the door and went out.</p>
<p>That night, Old Zhang didn't come back.</p>
<p>○○○</p>
<p>Half a month later.</p>
<p>The middle-aged woman who usually came to mutter every morning at eight o'clock but always went back empty-handed suddenly disappeared. Instead, a young girl of about fourteen or fifteen came.</p>
<p>"You嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌嫌My My My My My My My My My My My My My My My My</p>
<p>The little eyes also knew how to cast a good flirtatious glance. It hit Old Zhang, and she got a pair of his underpants.</p>
<p>When I saw her retreating figure, I quickly thought of a "flirt."</p>
<p>"Your mom is too old, you're too young." Old Zhang made another suggestive comment.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but worry about the young girl's precious youth.</p>
<h3 id="e263">Famous Quotes on President Chiang Kai-shek's "Working Principles" <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>President Chiang Kai-shek recently drafted sixteen "Working Principles" to instruct his subordinates to follow. Among them, besides a few that are more suitable for military affairs, and without discussing them, now I will add my personal views and elaborate on the remaining principles as follows:</p>
<p>1.  "Look at the big picture, start with the small details"—The success of any undertaking always comes from efforts in small details. Therefore, one should start with the small details when doing things. But while working on the small details, one must not overlook the big picture, so as not to have the disadvantage of caring for the small and losing the big. This is why one should look at the big picture and start with the small details.</p>
<p>2.  "Don't lack a sense of responsibility when doing things"—A person's most valuable asset when doing things is a sense of responsibility. Without a sense of responsibility, it goes without saying that things will be started but not finished; even if they succeed by chance, it will always be a fluke. When Chinese people do things, they often don't know where their responsibility lies. This is true not only for public affairs but also for private matters. Therefore, this principle is truly one that everyone should follow.</p>
<p>3.  "Knowing is difficult, doing is easy"—This saying was invented by Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and it contradicts the ancient saying that knowing is easy and doing is difficult. When we do things, we often know what should be done but not how to do it. This is clear evidence that knowing is difficult and doing is easy. Even if we don't know, we can still do it. We must adhere to this belief in everything we do.</p>
<p>4.  "Say it and do it, finish it and then talk"—Consistency between words and deeds is also an important condition that must be followed when doing things. Many people can talk but not act, which is a big problem. Who can't talk big? But if you only talk without doing, then talking is as good as not talking. Therefore, you must put what you say into practice immediately. After you have finished what you said, then talk about something else.</p>
<p>5.  "Be methodical and organized when doing things"—You must have a plan when doing things. With a plan, you can proceed step by step. Otherwise, you will be at a loss, unable to distinguish between urgent and important matters, and putting things in the wrong order, resulting in much effort for little result.</p>
<p>6.  "Don't be perfunctory or shirk responsibility when doing things"—This is because you lack a sense of responsibility in everything you do, so you only want to be perfunctory in order to get rid of your responsibilities. When we do things, we shouldn't do them at all, but if we do, we must be responsible and see them through to the end. We must never be sloppy so that we can clarify where responsibility lies.</p>
<p>7.  "When doing things, [only fulfill my responsibilities, don't shirk blame, and even more so, don't compete for credit"]—Most people like to compete for credit and shirk blame. When there is a mistake, they will try to shirk it in every way. Not only do they not regret their mistake, but they sometimes even implicate others. If they happen to achieve something, they boast and compete for credit. Little do they know that you must do your best, correct your mistakes, and not take credit for your accomplishments to be considered great.</p>
<p>8.  "Look for things to do, don't wait for things to do"—Those who are willing to work should look for things to do; those who are unwilling to work can only wait for things to do. But those who wait for things to do often don't do their best when something comes up. Those who can truly do things must always look for things to do.</p>
<p>9.  "Talk less, do more"—This is similar to the meaning of the fourth principle, which teaches people to work hard without saying empty words.</p>
<p>10. "Don't be ambitious or fickle when doing things"—This means that you should start with things that are easy to do, and you must have perseverance. If you are ambitious or fickle, you will rarely achieve anything.</p>
<p>11. "Be smart and concise when doing things"—You must be smart and concise in your work. But it is better to be slow and smart than to be concise and sloppy.</p>
<h3 id="e264">Mei Ying's Hands <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— Ya Bin</p>
<p>Mei Ying is the maid at Mrs. Zhang's house, a beautiful, lively, intelligent, and lovely girl.</p>
<p>It is said that Mei Ying is only seventeen years old this year, but she has grown so tall; her good breasts are protruding, constantly undulating; her face is always red, like a newly opened peach blossom; her eyes are clear and watery, and when they move, it is like a drop of cool water rolling on a tender green lotus leaf, so bright and cheerful... In short, she is a healthy beauty, she has fully developed—However, what Mrs. Zhang is most satisfied with is her hands, her rich muscle so strong hands. Really, Mei Ying's hands, just like Mrs. Zhang's own something, as long as she is happy, whatever she wants, she simply says what is needed, Mei Ying's hands will give it to her. As for all the daily affairs of her home, such as cooking, sweeping, washing clothes, dressing the little Miss and the fourth young master,... she does not need to open her mouth, Mei Ying's hands always do it well for her.</p>
<p>There are many people in Mrs. Zhang's house! Mr. Zhang, Mr. Zhang's grandfather and grandmother, Miss Li Zhen, the eldest young master, the fourth young master (the second and third young masters are said to have died early), the little Miss, and Mr. Zhang's young mistress, together with Mrs. Zhang, there are a total of nine people. As for the maid, there is only Mei Ying. So all the daily affairs of this big family, even sending the little Miss and the fourth young master to school, fall on Mei Ying alone. If she was an ordinary person, she would not be able to cope with it. But fortunately, her hands are so useful. She gets up at six o'clock in the morning and starts sweeping the floor, turning on the water, cooking porridge, buying groceries, washing clothes, scrubbing the floor... All of these depend entirely on her hands. She is very good at using them flexibly, she can even do two things at the same time, such as cooking while washing clothes, knitting wool sweaters for the little Miss and the fourth young master, and also giving Mrs. Zhang chicken stew to nourish her stomach... This is impossible without her particularly flexible hands.</p>
<p>Therefore, Mrs. Zhang especially likes her, and even gives her five yuan a month in wages (it is said that maids in Shanghai mostly get three or four yuan a month), and sometimes even gives her some exceptions, such as letting her sell the monthly Shen Bao newspaper for money... etc. Mei Ying is of course very happy, and also works very faithfully for Mrs. Zhang, she never utters a complaint, always smiling. Whenever Mr. He, the tenant living in the pavilion room of Mrs. Zhang's house, asks her; "Mei Ying, are you very busy?" She always answers with a smile... "Nothing!" At the same time, those particularly strong hands are also constantly shaking, as if to indicate... They are very capable of listening to my use!</p>
<p>However, Dong Ping came. After several frosts and snows, Mei Ying's particularly strong hands became red and swollen day by day. Later, they even cracked and bled. But she seemed not to feel any pain, and was still happy to work. One day, Mr. He kindly said...</p>
<p>"Mei Ying, your hands!"</p>
<p>"Frozen, ah!"</p>
<p>"Buy some frostbite medicine and rub it on!"</p>
<p>"No, they will naturally get better next spring!"</p>
<p>She was still so happy.</p>
<p>But no matter what, Mei Ying's hands could not be used as flexibly as before. Washing vegetables, sweeping the floor, especially washing clothes, could not be done quickly either. So Mrs. Zhang's unhappy expression increased day by day, as long as she saw Mei Ying's hands, she would say hatefully... "Hum, hum, look at you' that ghostly appearance!"</p>
<p>One afternoon, it was snowing heavily, Mei Ying carrying a large water jug, went to the living room to ask Mrs. Zhang for two copper coins to make hot water to wash clothes. But somehow, Mrs. Zhang became stingy with two copper coins, she opened her fire-like eyes, and scolded Mei Ying...</p>
<p>"What must you make hot water? Isn't cold water good to wash with?"</p>
<p>"My hands are frozen, ah!"</p>
<p>"Frozen! How come they don't freeze when they're often outside? Sleeves are so short! Humph!"</p>
<p>"If the sleeves were longer, how could I do things!" But Mrs. Zhang seemed not to have heard, and said even more viciously...</p>
<p>"Often putting your hands outside, buying promiscuity! Thinking you're beautiful, seducing people!" Saying that, she rushed into her bedroom.</p>
<p>Mei Ying suddenly opened her eyes wide, as if she had lost her mind, standing there blankly without saying a word. After several minutes, she began to cry softly—this was her first cry!</p>
<p>But Mrs. Zhang said in the room... "Still crying! Not happy, are you? Get out of here next month!"</p>
<p>"Slee... sleeves... if they're... longer... can't do things, ah..." This was the only thing Mei Ying managed to say in her crying.</p>

<h3 id="e265">The Soviet Russian Kerosene Industry <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Huaming</p>
<p>The Soviet Russian kerosene industry has some shortcomings in the amount of kerosene production, oil refining and transport; between expanding the amount produced in new areas and its accelerating development; between expanding the amount of production and increasing the amount of natural oil refined. However, these difficulties, cannot stop the prosperity of the kerosene industry. The Soviet Russian kerosene industry is developing every day; and now it has already taken the second rank of the world kerosene industry.</p>
<p>The development of the Soviet Russian kerosene industry is very astounding, because in the previous Old Russia era the kerosene industry was very backward. The first World War, caused Baku—the greatest kerosene producing area of the Soviet Russian—to shrink its market. In the World War, the greatest blow to the kerosene industry was when the whole of the outer Caucasus was forcefully occupied by the troops of other countries.</p>
<p>At the end of the Great War, the Soviet Russian government was faced with an extremely difficult job. Most of the oil fields and kerosene wells were destroyed, and even those that weren't destroyed were mostly in a desolate state. This can be verified by the below facts... in 1913 when the Tsar was in power, the amount produced using the old methods was 9.13 million tons; but in 1920 to 1921, the total amount produced was only 3.78 million tons! In such a short period of time, what method should be used to cause the kerosene industry, to not only revert to the original state of 1913 but also greatly surpass it?</p>
<p>But after the Great War ended, the kerosene problem, was immediately taken with utmost importance, because the country was exactly needing oil to advance its industry and power stations.</p>
<p>With the common participation of all the workers of Soviet Russia, the kerosene industry began to rebuild anew. A large quantity of funding was assigned for the purpose of restoring the kerosene industry. In 1923 to 1928, a total of 628,000,000 rubles was spent. During the first five year plan, a total of 1,440,000 was spent.</p>
<h3 id="e266">Research on Current Affairs: The Problem of Raising Silver Prices <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— Yimin</p>
<p>After Roosevelt came to power, in order to revive the American economy, in addition to implementing a controlled economy, monetary inflation, lowering the price of the US dollar, and buying gold, he recently put into effect the policy of raising the price of silver. After this news came, industrialists and businessmen, bankers, and all people in the government and the public concerned about the Chinese economy paid close attention. For a time, there were many discussions, so that the long-depressed silver problem became tense and important again.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the United States raising the price of silver is to develop trade in the Far East and compete with the British and Japanese forces. Because most parts of the Far East use silver, if the price of silver rises, it will be easier for American goods to be dumped in various parts of the Far East.</p>
<p>China is the main silver standard country in the Far East, and at the same time it is the largest country with an import surplus. If the price of silver is raised, it may seem to increase China's purchasing power on the surface, but in reality, it facilitates the dumping of American goods, completely taking away the domestic goods market that we are working hard to promote. Our national industry, under the devastation of imperialism, has long presented a crisis of bankruptcy; the reason why it can still linger on is that it still maintains a considerable portion of the sales market in the country. If this part of the domestic sales market is taken away by American goods due to the increase in the price of silver, then its future is truly unimaginable! At the same time, as the price of silver rises and American goods are dumped in China, the result will inevitably be a large outflow of our country's silver. According to the report of the Bank of China, the total amount of silver in Shanghai is... 142.48 million taels of silver, 33.678 million yuan of current silver, and 15,819 large bars. This is not a very large number either. If, under the dumping of American goods, our silver reserves decrease day by day as the number of import surpluses increases, it will make the economy unable to circulate, and even cause a great financial panic, leading to the disorder of the entire society—this can be foreseen.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, because the price of silver is raised, the trading of silver will inevitably become active, which is beneficial to general compradors and speculators. At the same time, if the price of silver rises and superficially increases our country's purchasing power, and practically facilitates the dumping of American goods, it will inevitably increase the revenue of our customs in the flow of silver in China. This is also conceivable.</p>
<p>These two phenomena that can occur as a result of raising the price of silver have defined the attitudes of our financiers, bankers, and industrialists towards this issue. Among them, some advocate postponing the approval of the London Silver Agreement and prohibiting the export of silver or levying export taxes on silver as a countermeasure against the United States' raising of the price of silver; others, on the contrary, say that the London Silver Agreement should be approved immediately to maintain international credit, and that prohibiting the export of silver or levying export taxes on it is a superficial view and that raising the price of silver is beneficial to us. As for who is right, in my opinion, it seems that they all have their reasons, but whether they are all speaking for the interests of the people and the masses is difficult to say.</p>
<h3 id="e267">How to Cater to the Psychology of Regular Customers <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— Long Sheng</p>
<p>As the saying goes: "Everyone sells plaster, but each person boils it differently." This saying reveals the key to success or failure in all shop competitions. Often, in the same area, shops selling the same goods, why is it that one business has a constant stream of customers while the other is deserted? The reason is nothing more than one being good at catering to the psychology of customers, and the other not having grasped the knack of doing business. Therefore, you can determine the prosperity or decline of a business by observing the way shop assistants deal with customers. Based on my experience, I have written down a few common-sense points that shop assistants should have when dealing with customers, as a mirror for newly-fledged shop assistants.</p>
<p>(1) Show the Advantages of the Goods</p>
<p>I remember once going to a hardware store to buy a kitchen knife. The shop assistant took out several kinds of kitchen knives and displayed them for me to choose. At that time, I hesitated and couldn't figure out which knife was the best. Another shop assistant standing next to me noticed my hesitation and interjected, "Sir, please give me two copper coins." I searched in my pocket and gave him two copper coins. He stacked the two copper coins on the counter, picked up a kitchen knife, and chopped the two copper coins in half with a "swish" sound. So I bought this kind of knife that could chop copper coins without hesitation. This shows that it is easier to make people believe by practically demonstrating the quality of goods than by just saying empty words. For example, in a candy store, first give customers candy to taste; in a silk and satin store, unfold the cloth and drape it on the customer so that they can judge for themselves. These are all good ways to induce customers to buy with pleasure.</p>
<p>(2) Guide Customers to Buy</p>
<p>Suppose a customer originally only wants to buy a toothbrush. After the toothbrush is bought, the shop assistant can take out toothpaste and soap for the customer to appreciate. Often, things that could be not purchased for the time being, are desired to be bought unconsciously because the goods are pleasing to the eye, or are felt to be beautiful or cheap. Also, if the customer brings children, the shop assistant can take the opportunity to give the children things they like to play with. If there are items that make noise, it is okay to make them sound, so that the children cannot bear to let go. Parents usually love their children, and when they see things that their children like, they often buy them even if they didn't intend to.</p>
<p>(3) Know the Contents of the Goods</p>
<p>Now selling goods, if you don't know the contents yourself, then when you encounter experienced customers asking questions, you will be at a loss for words, wouldn't that be a joke? Therefore, shop assistants should first do some research on the contents of the goods they sell, such as the nature, manufacturing method, and place of origin of the goods. It is best to also understand the situation of similar goods, so that they can answer any questions customers may have with ease. For example, if a customer wants to buy a rosewood table, but thinks the price is too high, the shop assistant can first explain the advantages of rosewood, and then compare it with padauk, fragrant rosewood, etc. After hearing this, the customer will naturally know that rosewood is the best and will not think the price is too high and will be willing to buy it.</p>
<p>(4) Pay Attention to Attitude</p>
<p>When we go to stores opened by foreigners to buy goods, sometimes we leave without buying anything. When leaving, the shop assistants are mostly amiable and even express deep regret. However, the situation in stores opened by our own people is different. I have encountered many times that in stores, because the goods were not bought successfully, the shop assistants not only showed displeasure, but also ridiculed and scolded at will, making you embarrassed. This shows that the level of cultivation of Chinese and foreign merchants is obviously different. The following points should be constantly reflected upon by shop assistants to see if they have committed them. If they have, they should correct them thoroughly. (1) Asking customers how much the value of the goods they want to buy is: or asking customers whether they want to buy high-priced or low-priced goods, contains the meaning of despising customers. (2) Not immediately serving customers with shabby clothes. (3) Not answering customers' questions in detail. (4) Arbitrarily making fun of customers who have unusual physical features. (5) Clothes are not clean: fingers are dirty. (6) Whispering to each other, causing customers to suspect.</p>

<h3 id="e268">Xia Men (Gorge Gate) <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— Xiong Wan</p>
<p>", Xia Men has arrived!" The waiter shouted with a smile, raising his voice.</p>
<p>Passengers in the cabins and steerage all crowded towards the bow of the ship where the anchor was dropped. They opened their eyes wide. Their round, black eyeballs constantly scanned in all directions, surprised, seeming unable to find a target.</p>
<p>The mountains are still generation after generation, the water is still rushing.</p>
<p>"Where is Xia Men?" Someone in the crowd asked to himself.</p>
<p>The sharp bow of the ship broke through the waves, and sped forward, white waves surged up one after another, splashing the deck of the bow. The people in front retreated unconsciously, the wind howled loudly. "Xia Men?" There is still no shadow.</p>
<p>Woo woo! The whistle called frantically, the surging waves "he he" echoed, the wind became stronger, and also brought some small drops of water, falling coldly on the face. The noise gradually subsided, the situation seemed tight, everyone pressed their chests with their hands, trying to stop their hearts from pounding. The ship continued to move forward: still retreating one after another, but the waterway directly ahead seemed to be gone. Standing far ahead, head-on, was a majestic mountain, and the ship seemed to be heading straight for that mountain.</p>
<p>"Isn't that Baidi City? A waiter holding a kettle of boiling water" shouted loudly. Although the eyes of the crowd glanced briefly at a small red isolated temple on the mountainside, they hurriedly retracted and continued to look ahead: seeming to be thinking about the same question: "How will the ship go?" The water surface became narrower and narrower, the water flow became faster and faster, the mountains on both sides, like giants stretching their waists, were steeper than each other, and the bow of the ship gradually swung to the right.</p>
<p>"Ah!" Everyone suddenly seemed to understand and exclaimed. The waterway originally turned to the right along the mountain. The river became even narrower, really amazing, as straight as a small stream. Observing with the eyes, it seems that only one ship can pass. The mountains on both sides stand upright, like soldiers saluting, straightening their waists, and forming a vertical line with the water surface. Even if there is a small boat docked on the shore, no one can climb ashore. There is only yellow and black soil on the mountain: protruding boulders: things that look like dry branches. Although it is still summer, you can't find a clump of green grass. The wind howls frantically. People stand still like stones, as if they will only feel comfortable when they see the river surface suddenly widen. The light is too dim, if the clock in the living room didn't say that it was only a quarter past three, everyone would think it was dark. Really, even the blue sky is only left with a long strip hanging overhead.</p>
<p>. The mountains on both sides force the eyes to only look forward.</p>
<p>The waterway is always turning, and each turn gives people a hope and a disappointment. The word "ah" often flies out of people's mouths.</p>
<p>Another waiter with a kettle of boiling water came. He pulled a young man who looked like a student and said, "The first turning is Xia Men. Can you see it clearly? There are still more than seven hundred li to leave the gorge!" He looked at the waiter's face, and then looked at the mountain beside him that was only a few steps away, and slowly squeezed out a "um" from his mouth:</p>

<p>France 370,000</p>
<p>In addition to the 45 million to 50 million</p>
<p>unemployed workers worldwide, there are also quite a few unemployed farmers, small property owners, and intellectuals, floating in the raging waves of the world economic panic.</p>
<p>Our China is no exception. Just in Shanghai alone,</p>
<p>the panic in the silk, cotton, flour and other industrial sectors in recent years has caused 500,000 workers to become unemployed. In addition to these 500,000, there are also many semi-unemployed (reduced work and reduced wages, etc.) workers, as well as unemployed shop assistants, intellectuals, etc.</p>

<h3 id="e271">Biography of a Famous Person Darwin (3) <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Fan</p>
<p>Naturally, this kind of collection was regarded as the supreme comfort to him. When Stephen's famous "Explanation of British Insects" used the specimens collected by Darwin and titled: "Captured by Mr. Charles Darwin", he was really ecstatic. He felt as happy as a poet seeing his debut work printed. The person who had the most influence on Darwin during his time at Cambridge must be mentioned here. That is Professor Henslow. Mr. Heng was quite similar to Mr. Da. He lectured on botany and liked to use clear evidence, which was completely different from the lectures of other schools. He often took students to the field to practice collecting and explained rare plants or animals. Therefore, Mr. Da admired him very much at that time. The two of them became very good friends. Mr. Da often went to Mr. Ting's house for dinner, or the two of them took long walks. At that time, there was a saying in the school that Mr. Da "is the person who often walks with Mr. Henslow". Mr. Ting had a wealth of knowledge about botany, entomology, and was proficient in chemistry, mineralogy, and geology. He liked to start from small observations and observe the changes in the long-term continuation of observations, and then use them as conclusions. This research method later gave Mr. Da a lot of influence.</p>
<p>Mr. Da graduated from Huaiqiao University in 1831 and obtained a BA degree, which was the end of Mr. Da's school life. Undoubtedly, his academic achievements will be in his own efforts in the future: especially in the Beagle trip that will be specially mentioned below.</p>
<p>"What a glorious day November 4th is! My second life will begin from this day, this day will be considered like today's birth for all kinds of things in the future!" In October 1831, Darwin obtained the opportunity to travel on the Beagle, and he was appointed as the naturalist of the Beagle ship. The above words were what he wrote to Fitzroy, the owner of the Beagle ship.</p>
<p>Naturally, this trip was crucial for Darwin's academic achievements in the future. The tour of tropical countries that he had longed for in his childhood was now realized.</p>
<p>On December 27, the Beagle ship left England and began its world tour. The purpose of this voyage was to measure the coasts of "Chile" and "Peru" and the islands of the Pacific Ocean, and then continue the world tour to continue the exploration of the coastline. Therefore, we had to stay for some time in the places we passed. So, our naturalist, with the opportunity to go everywhere, either galloped on isolated islands, barren hills, or plunged into the thatched huts of barbarians, or swayed on small boats on the shores of the vast sea, or climbed the tropical forests on foot. He passed through the great desert, went to Fire Island, stayed on the top of the coral island, and he couldn't help but feel his own insignificance and the vastness of the universe in the vast tropical forest, and he couldn't help but feel nostalgic when he saw the naked body of the barbarian. During the trip, the main work was naturally to collect many kinds of animals and plants, make a rough dissection of them, and attach a simple narrative. Among them, the collection of crustaceans was the most complete.</p>
<p>This trip lasted for five years and two months. In the long journey, he trained him to work with concentration and focus: and aroused his interest in geology. Originally, he used to think that geology was boring, but now it has completely changed. "I have found a permanent and unremitting interest in geology, which has created a kind of"</p>
<p>Great ideas are also like astronomy to the universe. One thing, when he discovered the geology of Santiago, he was overjoyed. It can be seen that the interest in learning lies in practice, and only practice can grow people's research heart. Darwin was not used to hiring geological lectures, but his success came from travel and practical investigation.</p>
<p>This trip fully provided research data for the genius, expanded the genius's vision, and developed a difficult</p>
<p>determination, turning his life into a forward-moving stage.</p>
<p>So he had to smile at the "creation project" in the Bible, and at the same time he had to re-evaluate the value of the natural scientists of the past.</p>
<p>This trip is over, he published the famous "Diary and Notes". (To be continued)</p>
