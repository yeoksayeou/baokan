<p>日內瓦軍縮會議。自德國退出後。卽瀕於僵局。其間雖經主要人物若干次之週旋。仍以法德兩國對立之形勢。無法緩和。幾至不能召成會議。後復經英國多方疏解。法蘇從旁督促。乃得於五月二十九日在日內瓦召集會議。與會者有六十四國。且有十四國由外長出席。不可謂非國際間之盛會。然而衡諸先例。凡國際間重要會議。英法等主要國家。多由負總責之內閣總理出席。今次僅由外長出馬。相形之下。已不免稍見遜色矣。</p>
<p>試考英國調和軍縮僵局之經過。卽知歐洲問題之難關全在乎法德之對立。而本年四月十七日法政府送致英國之覺書。仍堅持其所謂「絕對安全保障。」謂非如此。法國卽不縮小軍備。更不能承諾德意志之軍備平等要求。法國此種主張。自去年十月十四日德國退出軍縮以來。卽巳反覆申述。而德國則不肯稍示讓步。希特勒且高標反凡爾賽和約之旗幟。盛倡第三帝國之口號。竭力煽動德意志民族報復之心理。雖其實力。未必卽足以撕毁和約。但確爲一種實行打破現狀之有力準備。法人於此。不能不加以戒備。而爲法國衛星之中歐諸小國。更不能不有所恐懼矣。</p>
<p>在此種不安狀態之下法國外交。仍力持鎭靜。而各小國則愈覺己國之可危故自波蘭以至多腦流域之小恊約國。均有不慊於法而另謀所以自衛之意。奥匈兩國。且顯然與意大利合作。於是法國當局。更不能不堅持自衛之主張矣。惟於中歐諸國。仍未肯稍加忽視。其外長巴爾都。拜訪波蘭之後。復歷訪中歐諸國。以謀凡爾賽體系之鞏固。其中最堪注目者。厥爲法德對立中之英法關係。在法國則以爲英國如欲調和軍縮僵局。使德國能相當滿意而參加軍縮。則至少須與法國恊力合作。共同保障其安全。而英國則以爲英國立塲。决不願有超過洛加羅條約以上之共同行動。蓋英國之意。固不願德國有突過英國之飛躍發展。亦不願法國獨霸全歐。使英國覇權感受威脅。故英法之間。亦隱然有不能恊調之暗礁存在。此外復加以意大利之爭霸運動。時而袒法抑德。時而助德攻擊凡爾賽和約以掣法。而諸小國復參雜其間。糾纷遂愈加劇。軍縮前途。已可想見。現在一般軍縮委員會。雖已開幕。而據以往情勢。以測將來。則不待智者。卽已知漢德森所希望陸軍軍備之縮减。空軍公約之訂立。與夫國際管理軍火之製造及運銷。皆爲國際會議席上一種外交酬應之空言而已。</p>
<p>軍縮會議之實在性。固已過去。而英法關聯以及小恊約國等自世界戰爭後。十數年來卽同行於同一軌道上。今後或仍竭力維持現狀。亦爲意中事。惟最値得注意者。卽法蘇之接近是也。法蘇兩國在大戰以前。原爲同盟國。戰後始相離反。表面原因。爲立國根本制度之不同。其實法國反蘇之內因。實爲二百萬萬法郎借欵之否認。與蘇德日相接近。第三國際又欲在西歐打開革命出路。致法國愈加危懼。反蘇之舉。遂愈明。顯頃者時移勢易。蘇聯旣盡其全力於國內建。設對世界革命。已漸放鬆。希特勒秉政後。民族運動之激昻。大有東侵蘇俄之勢。於是蘇聯乃一轉其外交之前鋒。努力於防止德國之東進政策。法國亦深恐中歐小國。非强德之敵。英國又詭譎不可恃。正圖另謀制限德國之途徑。於是蘇法捍隔已久之國交。竟能同唱和平之聲。而有軍事同盟之報道。當此軍縮會議僅餘回光反照之際。國際問題之重心。或將以法蘇接近爲轉移乎。</p>

<h3>總委會昨日開會軍縮臨存亡關頭　英法異見無法消融　會議展期至下週二</h3>
<p>顧代表痛言軍縮失敗將影響遠東</p>
<p>力主集合制保障安全</p>
<p>西門離日內瓦返倫敦</p>
<p>（日內瓦）今日午後軍縮會總委員會集議時、軍縮會主席漢德森痛陳時局之嚴重、籲請各代表繼續進行談判、成立軍備公約、繼乃提議總委員會延會至下星期二日、俾便各代表沉思現所發生甚危急之局勢、並便英法代表消釋爭見、獲取妥恊、當總委員會開會之前、休息室中空氣緊張、各代表三五成團、聚談軍縮會之前途、暢所欲言、毫無隱諱、皆覺軍縮會巳臻千鈞一髮之局勢、三時四十五分漢德森莊容登壇宣布開會、而較豫定時間已遲十五分鐘、漢德森以沉痛之詞籲請各代表挽救軍縮會後、乃宣讀國聯恊會在福克斯通開會時所通過之决議案、其中切言如軍縮會失敗、時局危險不堪設想、各代表嗣聞英外相西門已購夜車票、豫備遄返倫敦、皆爲驚訝不置、衆對此事、見解不一、或謂西門之返乃商諸內閣者、或謂西門因覺久駐日內瓦、無補大局、故返倫敦云、（一日路透電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）軍縮總委員會開會時、主席漢德森致詞、謂軍縮會現狀、極爲嚴重、甚於任何時期、渠甚爲焦慮、目前局勢、非僅僅發表議論而能解决異見、故渠提議延會至下星期二日、並於星期一日舉行主幹部會議、俾各代表在本星期杪有從容考慮之機會、屆時各代表或可覓得緣以進行之途徑、今人人欲得完全之成功、毫無疑義、但必須獲一讓步、並將此讓步見諸實行云、</p>

<p>波蘭外長貝克批評俄外長李維諾夫所提出永久機關之計畫、指此與國聯權威互相抵觸、舍此而外、渠願意贊助可解决此問題之任何提議云、</p>
<h3>顧維鈞氏發言安全軍縮不可分離</h3>
<p>中國駐法公使顧鈞博士繼起演說、謂中國代表團自軍縮會開會以來、卽注重對於安全問題覔一美滿解决方法、蓋以此問題乃各種困難之眞正原因也、顧博士繼謂吾人表示　　如現有之集合行動制度不予以實施、則軍縮主義將陷於危境之意見、已不止一次、國際條約規定和平解决國際爭執、並禁止施用武力爲政策工具之義務、如被蔑視破壞、而不以集合的行動制止之、則人皆不願遽從事軍縮、諸君尙憶軍縮會甫開其門而着手工作時、適遠東發生不宣之戰爭、一國挾其優勢軍隊侵入他國、絕不顧慮國際條約下之莊嚴義務、夫此國際條約者、固世人所視爲最重要之和平撑持物也、但歷時兩年有半、侵略之所獲、仍爲侵略者所有、而受犧牲者、則無一人爲其助、雖有國聯盟約下之共同義務、然無效也、此種不可爭之事實與敎訓、當然爲眼光遠大之政治家所不能忘者、簡言之、目前集合的和平制度、絕未獲有充分安全、安全乃基本問題、與軍縮問題不可判離也、如有一般恊定根據集合的保障制定有效力的安全制度、並確保其實施有效、則軍縮問題其他各點之爭執、自易於解决矣、渠對於英外相西門所稱安全問題乃程度問題、而非原則問題之說、表示同意、如軍備不能完全廢除、則僅僅减少軍備、而不輔以根據於集合保障與必予實施之安全制度、則和平終不能固定也云云（一日路透電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）第三者之談話與調停、迄未有融化英法異見之效力法外長巴爾都接法總理杜邁格來電、嘉獎其星期三日驚人言論、故法方態度愈形堅强、一般感想以爲苟未有出人意外之發展、則今日午後三時半軍縮會總委員會集會時所可採行之唯一方法在宣佈休會、以待列强間之諒解、蓋無此諒解、則談判决不能成功也、但小國代表或將作最後之努力、主張討論英外相西門所建議之三點、卽㈠限制化學戰爭、㈡預算案公開、㈢成立永遠軍縮委員會是、法國對於預算公開始終反對、除非預算公開與預算限制同時並行耳無論如何、衆認此種法較諸軍縮會原有之偉大計畫、亦渺乎其微已、（一日路透電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）軍縮會之存亡、殆將於明日决之雖一般意見以爲軍縮會之延會、乃唯一解决法、但目前空氣極爲不靖主席漢德森今晚對路透訪員稱、在過去兩年半之時期中、時局嚴重、未有如今日之甚者、苟不迅速改變、則時局巳無希望、各代表極不欲明白說明其地位、討論或將在明日總委員會開會時結束云、西班牙與瑞典兩國代表現努力擬融洽英法態度、將再提出荷蘭丹麥挪威西班牙與瑞士前巳贊同之四月十四日瑞典備忘錄、而略加以修正、按此備忘錄所主張者、內有㈠立卽設法阻止現有局勢愈臻惡化、㈡無條件禁止天空轟炸、㈢確實裁减軍備、㈣同等權利之原則予以相當的但切實的實現等辦法、（卅一日路透電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）自日昨英外相西門及法外長巴爾都發表其演說、互相爭辯之後、國聯方面至今仍在紊亂之中、而軍縮會議主席漢德森有見於此、特設法將會議展期至星期五、以便各國代表團得有餘暇、可以從長考慮之機會、現日內瓦各方面均覺英法之間、意見巳深至不可調解之地步、而軍縮會議之死期、亦卽近在眉睫、但爲使會議討論不中斷起見、已有人出而授意蘇俄外委李維諾夫、使彼向軍縮會議提出議案、其中包含彼日前所發表演說中之諸要點、此或卽爲軍縮會議之續命湯、亦未可知、再則英外相西門復將於下屆會議時提出組織永久軍縮會議之建議、大槪亦可付諸討論、再則西門與李維諾夫二人所提議之事項、異點亦至明顯、卽李氏主張之主點在「安寗」、而西門之主張仍在解除軍備也、（卅一日國民電）</p>
<h3>祇求結束會議英國不存奢望　不妨縮小範圍訂立公約　以同心圈方法組織安全</h3>
<p>（倫敦）議會多數黨人士竟公然希望軍縮問題能加以淸理、惟外交界則以結束軍縮會議、至少目前不合時宜、故繼續希望能以下列四點爲範圍、訂立軍縮公約、卽㈠限制空軍、㈡禁止化學及毒菌戰爭、㈢監察軍備㈣以「同心圈」方法、組織安全、但英國對於組織之參加、僅以互相諮商爲限（按同心圈、或卽各國分訂區域條約、以保障安全之謂、每一區域、卽爲一同心圈、）政府黨爲應付反對派之工黨計、顯欲遮蓋軍縮之失敗、且實有遮蓋之必要、因此卽對於李維諾夫之主張、亦擬加以審查、而取其可爲英國所考慮者、且在若干範圍之內、並擬採取意大利計畫、只須法國同意耳、但英國人士對於軍縮之成功、並不存奢望、以故卽使範圍極小之方式、如能取得國際一致之同意、英國亦欣然受之、如釋重負、蓋藉此可以證明防止戰爭之努力、非全然無效也、（卅一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國方面對於蘇联外交委員李維諾夫在軍縮總委員會之建議、雖並無響應、但英國大部分輿斌、多希望軍縮會議、因李維諾夫所提議之歐洲安全公約而苟延生命、此則難以否認、例如自由黨機關報「孟却斯德保衛報」卽抱此種態度、該報謂李維諾夫僅作口頭建議、尙未提出具體之决議草案、但若干小國見軍縮會議至今一事無成、有此决議案、聊勝於無或將儘速提出、未可知也、無論何種軍縮公約欲求其稍有價値、則斷不能將安全問題置諸不問、吾人固當參加安全問題之解决、但不能因此卽證明英國已明瞭解决安全問題之方法　如小國及蘇聯確將提出歐洲保安公約之正式建議、則無論如何軍縮會議在承認失攺之前、對於此種提議、固有一加審議之必要也云云、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英法意見相左不致影響邦交　倫敦巴黎輿論一斑</h3>
<p>（倫敦）英國各報紙對於軍縮會議、似已不復希望其得到具體之結果、其所登載者、大抵爲日內瓦訪員所報告之悲觀消息、各訪員有以爲軍縮問題已完全陷入僵局者、有視軍縮會議已在危險期中者、亦有以爲談判形勢似已傾於延會之一途者、泰晤土報謂、「昨日巴爾都演說、揭破英法意見之參差、使人明瞭眞相、未始無益、英法意見雖不相合、然彼此國交並不因之冷淡」新紀事報謂「目下最合於理智之辦法、莫若於短期內結束軍縮會議、俟形勢利便時再行召集」云云、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）昨日軍縮總委員會停會一日、此間各報乘機將西門與巴爾都兩人演說所生之反響、加以論列、咸視西門之言在求軍縮會議之結束、而巴爾都之言則欲使會議復呈生氣、晨報謂西門啓程赴日內瓦時、麥唐納曾令其於適宜時機、設法使軍縮會議結束工作、蓋欲以此手段、使英國輿論援助英政府、從事空軍之擴充也、依晨報所見、巴爾都之演說、適予英</p>
<p>人以可乘之機會云、此外各報自昨日以來、咸以爲巴爾都之演說坦白而光明、對於英法國交並無不良影響、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>法外長宴請各國代表</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）法國外長巴爾都今晨在此間設宴、邀請英國外相西門·瑞士代表穆塔·比利時外相希孟·日本駐法大使佐藤·荷蘭外長德克拉夫·國聯秘書長愛文諾·及法國外部國聯事務局長瑪西格里亦均列席、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）陸軍部長貝當上將、本日出席衆院財政委員會、對於邊境防禦工事之組織提出說明、此項工程經費預定數額稍有超出、貝當上將予以解釋、謂其原因有三、（一）新工程浩大、技術人員估計稍有錯誤、（二）穿鑿地層時時遭遇困難、（三）防禦工程之建築、務於一九三四年底、及入伍壯丁人數開始減少之時期以前、趕緊完成、（按一九一四年至一九一八年歐戰期內、法國人民生育减少、以致一九三五年至一九三九年間入伍壯丁人數大减）貝當謂防禦設備、務求精良、庶戰事發生、人命犧牲可以減少、社會黨議員略提異議、貝當一一答覆、並謂議員明瞭德國軍備情形、若亦與渠相同、則對防禦工事經費必予以表决、毫不猶預矣、各議員若願取獲關於德國軍備之情報、則渠凖備供給云云、委員會當卽議决贊成貝當上將之見地、（三十一日日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>法德軍事預算念七與八之比　孰加威脅事理至明顯　德外交評論發表一文</h3>
<p>（柏林）德國外交評論報今日載一論文、對於法外長巴爾都之演說有所辯答　因巴氏曾論及德國最近軍備預算之增加、謂爲德國重整軍備之鐵證云、德國外交評論報則提出論題、「法國究係受何國之危害？」、該報復謂「如德國因自衛而增加其設備、法國卽引以爲己身之危害、則德國之預算僅八萬萬馬克、而法國之軍備預算竟達廿七萬萬之鉅、然則究係何國危害何國、事理至爲明顯也且八萬萬馬克之軍備預算、是否卽爲充份之理由、俾法國可再行增加其武裝至三十萬萬佛郎之鉅、如法國政府所要求而經議會相當之同意者、再則如德國之消極航空建設以及民用飛航事業、是否卽爲法國政府增加其軍用航空設備自一萬五千萬至五萬萬馬克之適當理由、誰是空中之危害者、毫無空軍設備之德國乎、抑世界空軍最强之法國乎」（卅一日國民電）</p>

<h3>國聯討論大厦谷爭案　决議援用盟約十五條處理　封鎖軍火僅盧森堡未答覆</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯行政院今日决定依據玻璃維亞政府之請求、援用國聯盟約第十五條處理巴玻兩國間關於大厦谷之爭執、行政院後開秘密會議、對於禁運軍火事之進行、表示滿意、現僅盧森國尙未答覆、德國雖未正式答復、但已表示願遵守行政院關於此事之任何决議、按盟約第十五條規定將爭議事件提交行政院、而由行政院盡力解决之、否則行政院公佈爭議之事實、及其所認爲公充適當之建議、今巴拉圭已允將此爭議提交行政院、故大厦谷進行多時之戰爭或可和平解决（一日路透電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）今日國聯行政院特别會議、討論大厦谷戰事、玻璃維亞代表抨擊巴拉圭之「勝忘形」、玻代表宣稱、巴拉圭近已購進大批軍火、封鎖軍火之議實有利於巴國、故玻國必須拒絕之、况巴拉圭可航運無阻、而玻璃維亞則已被圍也、（三十一日國民電）</p>
<p>玻京　玻璃維亞政府現諭令國內男子生於一九一五年與一九一六年者、從今日起入營服務、時局嚴重可知、國聯雖努力調解、巴玻戰事、已歷數月　然交戰國迄未有息戰言和之意、國聯對此兩國斷絕軍火供給之禁令、迄未見諸實施、今日玻政府之徵集新兵、殆爲巴軍擊潰玻軍第三師之後果、（三十一日路透社電）</p>

<h3>日方阻撓冀省特警開入戰區　對人數及武器種類故意刁難　軍分會電召雷壽榮返津交涉</h3>
<p>天津通信、冀省新編之特警隊、開入戰區問題、經殷汝耕在平與日使館武官柴山交涉多日、迄未得有結果殷汝耕爲此事昨特來津向于學忠有所報告、事實上新編特警隊與保安隊係屬換防性質、并無所謂增加防軍之說、祗以華北目前通車通郵兩事、猶未實現、日方遂故意刁難、不成問題者亦成爲問題、此外日方所認爲人數過多、及機關槍不准携入戰區指爲重火器兩項、皆不過藉口之詞、因現在駐屯戰區内之周毓英·魏永和·及楊永山三部保安隊、亦在八千名以上、並各携有機關槍特警隊卽不開去、保安隊留防戰區内、其實力亦復相等、並非特警隊開去後我方實力卽增加若干、日方引爲顧慮、殊屬節外生枝、省方目前對此項交涉、不取積極、擬候軍分會主持辦理、軍分會之意、以當初塘沽恊定、關於戰區特警隊人數及應携武器種類、旣未簽在約文之上、僅屬經手人口頭相約、時過境遷、日方以我淡忘、故意狡賴、故必須原經手人北來、與日方當面接洽、而原經手人爲熊斌·李擇一·雷壽榮·熊李兩人、一在江西、一在福建、短時間不能北上、惟雷壽榮新自日本返南京、因特電催北來、擬在黃郛未歸華北前、由雷壽榮根據當日談判紀錄、與日解决、雷如不能解决、則俟黃郛歸後恊助辦理、惟最近日使館武官柴山、向殷汝耕表示、此事關係重大、須直接與關東軍部商洽爲宜、因此或於上述兩項辦法外、由軍分會派遣雷壽榮·殷汝耕·赴長春一行、以期與日關東軍部早日商妥、至新編之特警隊、刻仍駐津南蔡村·滄縣·兩處、每日訓練、待命令一下、卽可動員、惟據觀察、在通車通郵未實現前、一時間猶不獲開入戰區、日方别具之深心、則利我戰區糜亂、不利我有秩序、</p>

<h3>歐洲形勢緊張中的法蘭西（法國通信）　議會政治已漸次解體　杜美格内閣傾向獨裁</h3>
<p>歐洲政局動搖不安、軍縮會議没有結果、其主要的原因就是法德對立關係愈見激化、同時意大利又要分佔中歐的霸權、於是乎法國的外交更要緊張起來、不但是要使德國不能多運用國際外交、使不能恢復其已往的實力、並且還要分力對付意大利、然而法國的内部、在經濟上、過去僅祇能勉强維持着不向下衰落、今年的經濟情形就非常的惡化、一般的經濟情勢姑且不論、單以國庫收入來講、本年度收入不敷的數目就有七十萬法郎、由此可見法國財政問題的嚴重、也就是法國内政上的一大癥結、</p>
<p>二月六日的巴黎暴動、這是一八七零年拿破崙第三没落、第三共和國成立以來、最重大的事件、不過這一次的暴動、祇限於巴黎巿内、其他各地方並没有同時發生相類的運動、的以政府還有彈壓的辦法、共和的基礎還不致於因王黨的騷動而動搖、至於斯塔維斯基一類的欺詐案、在法國近一世紀中不知出過了幾多次、所以並不算是什麽了不得的得重大問題、固然王黨和共產黨可以借此煽起一個運動、民衆方面也有不少的人和他們表同情、不過要排除社會的惡劣勢力、却無須</p>
<p>要根本推翻現制度、我們考察示威羣衆所用的暴力、其武器也不過是些小刀小</p>
<p>石頭等、也就可測知羣衆的觀感何如了、所以前總統杜美格以七十二歲的高年出任艱鉅、他以老政治家出擔任非常時期的總理、首先就要求各黨的領袖、要他們「今後中止一切的政爭、」他又在議會中提出希望條件、要衆議院「爲法蘭西的政治安定起見、表示再不繼續發生那樣愚劣形勢、」結果他得到了議會的信任、從三月中旬到五月中旬衆院休會兩個月、這就是政府不受議院的干涉、而實得預算上的節約、像關稅率的變更等獨裁權法國近三年以來、議會政治漸次解體、黨派太多、不能發揮議會的作用、又不能使政治相當的安定、杜美格内閣的獨裁是否將令法國的政局、因外交緊張的激剌而轉入於法西斯化的政治、還是一個問題哩、</p>
<p>法國一般人民、自由平等的思想、十分發</p>
<p>達、過去曾爲政治自由而支付過鉅大的犧牲、如左黨的領袖赫里歐所發表的意見是「我們要和現在風靡一世的獨裁政治思想毫無假借的挑戰、因爲獨裁政治内足以威脅政治自由、外足以障碍國際和平……」、法國的議會政治、誠然已將牠的劣點暴露無遺了、不過在政治上、法總統僅祇是一位、等於木偶的元首、在憲法上他雖然有解散議會的權力、但自馬克馬洪總統在一八七七年試過一次失敗了以後、就再没有第二次解散議會的事、是以無論任何組閣、一日遭遇議會的不信任投票、無論如何都不能解散議會、重新選舉、問人民的眞意何如、祗有内閣辭職之一途、有了這種根基所以法蘭西的政治卽令有獨裁傾向、其性質也是另自一種類型、何况杜美格個人也和希特勒·墨索里尼不同、所以杜美格的獨裁不會像意國和德國那樣無限制的發展、</p>
<p>總之、現時法國的非常時内閣頗有獨裁的意味、其主要目的還是在乎鎭定國内的不安、保持現狀、至於國際方面、她將盡力維持其現有地位、甚至不惜出相當的代價、犧牲巳往的成見、以求國際間的鞏固地位如與蘇聯親善、以壓服德國、以限制意大利、國際間的一般情形、大有回到一九一四年以前的外交狀勢、國内的趨向、則議會政治的影象在法國也是日漸稀薄了、（四月二十六日於巴黎）</p>

<h3>（主席報告）</h3>
<p>主席團行　揭幕升旗禮畢、回至主席臺上、由王延松主席報告、略謂、今日爲本巿國貨運動展覽大會、舉行開幕典禮之期、今日人人皆知國貨之應當提倡、故關於國貨運動、巳屢次舉行、雖成績較往年略好、但吾人需要繼續努力之處正多、試查海關報告、在積極抵制聲中、劣貨稍受影響、迄今劣貨又復活躍、將再傾銷於中國巿塲、甚多危慮、希望今後國貨廠商、力謀改良出品、巿民亦應踴躍購用、庶幾我國民經濟、不致被侵略殆盡、使國脈橫受</p>
<p>摧殘也、</p>
<h3>（代表致辭）</h3>
<p>次由實業部代表國際貿易局局長何炳</p>
<p>賢致詞、何氏略謂、吾國自與各國通商以來、每年入超、恒在七萬萬至八萬萬以上、爲何入超數目如此之大、外貨如此之多、實因我國本身不能有大量國貨生產之故、國貨少故不能出超、不能到國外找巿塲、此後國貨商人、應須警悟者、不要一意以圖利爲事、見人以某貨得利則爭相騖趨、應須自爲别創、勿自相傾軋、又營業切不可望一本萬利、因此爲經濟學上所必無、有錢在商業上投資則可、投機則萬萬不可、此爲本人今日在大會所供獻之愚見、次由巿府代表章淵若演說、略謂、中國人何以窮、歐美人何以富、卽因國人要送錢給外人用、今後做國貨運動、要全數中國人努力、不送錢給外人用、試觀去年德人海京伯來滬做馬戲、任憑何種微小之物、都從德國帶來、德國人不肯給一個錢給我國人用、此種精神、値得吾人仿傚、蓋非勤勉刻苦、不足以言提倡國</p>
<p>貨也云、次又有巿商會代表王曉籟氏演說、略謂、提倡國貨、空口說白話無用、要下决心想出路、第一不要買東西（東西洋</p>
<p>貨）、第二不要化費無用之錢、如香烟之類、亦絕對不吃、因此物完全付之一炬、且原料均爲外貨也、最後更有婦女國貨年運動委員會代表林克聰·國際貿易局</p>

<p>多事之五月節、業已平安過去、巿公安局昨特撤消全日戒備令、惟明日爲共黨紀念節、仍飭屬依照通常戒備辦法、加緊防範、茲分誌如下、</p>
<h3>昨日撤消戒備</h3>
<p>巿公安局爲維持五月革命紀念節、地方治安起見、曾分令各區實施戒備、並與淞滬警備司令部、保安處等各機關、决定聯防辦法、恊力進行、自五一勞働節起、至五卅南京路慘案紀念日爲止、全月加緊防範、幸未發生任何紛擾、現五月節已過、巿公安局長文鴻恩將於昨日起、撤消全月戒備令、並對各區所官長、努力捍衛地方、頗爲激勵、嗣後如遇紀念節時、均爲　常戒備云、</p>
<h3>明日臨時防範</h3>

<h3>庚欵英金公債　中外四銀行承受　决先發行預約劵</h3>
<p>新聲社云、民國二十三年六厘英金庚欵公債一百五十萬鎊、於昨日發行、由中央中國交通匯豐等四銀行承受、合同行將簽訂、决先發預約劵、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>簽訂合同　鐵道部爲完成粤漢鐵路、以庚欵作抵、會同財政部、於昨日發行民國二十三年六厘英金庚欵公債、並由中央中國交通匯豐等四銀行承受、規定按票額九六發行、惟四銀行之承受、較九六發行略低、業已由財政部與匯豐等四銀行接洽妥當承受、合同京已擬就、日内卽可正式簽訂、</p>
<p>發預約券　新聲社記者昨向銀行界探悉、此項公債、由中國等四銀行承受後、由四銀行向國内處推銷、凡國内銀行及國處銀行如欲購買是項公債者、均由承受之四銀行經理、至於此項公債、尙未付印、財政部决先發預約劵、俟公債印就後、再行掉換、惟預約劵雖得自由買賣抵押、担不能流通債券巿塲、</p>
<p>中央社一日南京電云、二十三年六厘英金庚欵公債共英金一百五十萬鎊、一日發行、規定明年一月一日第一次還本、至三十六年一月一日、本息全數還淸、該項公債、作爲完成粤漢路建築基金之用、一日已發行、</p>
<h3>意庚欵借欵憑證票面　財部已與銀團商定</h3>
<p>每月每銀行發行本息數額四張</p>
<p>准由銀團向中央及凖備會抵押</p>
<p>財政部將意國退還庚欵作担保、向中央等十六家銀行抵借四千四百萬元、早已由各承借銀行如數解部、茲該欵憑證票面、業由中央等十六家組織之銀團、與財部商洽妥當、得隨時向中央銀行公會聯合凖備委員會抵押流通巿面、至昨日京電傳、財部發行三千萬證券說、實屬不確、茲將新新社記者探悉各情、分誌如次、</p>
<p>發還本息　依照借欵合同規定、財部應發給銀團之憑證、自民國二十三年一月至六月止之憑證、財部已於四月底交給銀團、轉交各承借銀行、至五月底應付之本息、業已於三十一日、由海關撥付中央銀行、由中央银行轉交銀團、再由銀團分别撥付各承借銀行、如數付訖、</p>
<p>憑證票面　關於憑證票面數目、業由財政部與銀團雙方商洽妥當、其辦法爲每月每銀行發行憑證本息各二張、其中一爲整數、一爲零數、例如某銀行承借三萬五千六百元、以三萬元塡寫一張、五千六百元則另寫一張、其餘　張、則塡寫整數與零數之利息數目、並聞該項憑證、已由財部國庫司交由上海中華書局承印、自本年七白起實行新辦法、</p>
<p>准許抵押　依照借欵合同、本規定銀團得一次發行證券三千萬、旋經財部與銀團商洽結果、由財部發給憑證、互相抵押後、當將三千萬元證券中止發行、茲據新新社記者、由銀團方面探悉、財部爲調劑金融起見、除規定憑證、得向銀團銀行互相抵押外、現復准與中央銀行及上海巿銀行同業公會聯合凖備委員會隨時抵押、流通巿面、</p>
<p>京電誤傳　昨日京電稱、財部已得銀團同意、將前次證券三千萬元改歸財部發行、銀團所受損失、由財部承認補助云云、新新社記者、昨日特向本巿銀行界及銀團各方面探悉、該項傳說、完全不確、並且事實上亦辦不到、蓋意庚欵已由財部向銀團抵借、取得現欵應用、如再發行三千萬證券、則屬同一抵押品、充作兩種不同抵押之用、不僅銀團方面萬難同意、想財部亦未必有此意見、况財部現已指定憑證、可隨時互相抵押、則無再行發行證券之必要云云、</p>
<h3>中央庚欵董事會通過分配數目</h3>

<h3>馬寅初談取締有奬儲蓄</h3>
<p>鼓勵僥倖心有妨正當儲蓄</p>
<p>資金由内地流出農村困苦</p>
<p>條約無根據禁止不必顧忌</p>
<p>新聲社云、立法院財政委員會委員長馬寅初、負吾國財政經濟界重望、此次在全國財政會議、提出請嚴禁中法萬國兩儲蓄會、並擬定（一）限制今後入會（二）澈查兩會欵項、經議决交財政部核辦、馬工並以此種有奬儲蓄、有害國計民生、至深且</p>
<p>鉅、爲使國人明瞭内幕起見、昨特對新聲京社記者發表其應禁之最大理由五點、及其個人感想、茲錄談話意見如下、</p>
<h3>財政會議</h3>
<p>此次全國財政會議、爲國府成立後第一次之財政盛會、意義深長、蓋我國將來實行統制經濟時、財政統制亦必同時實行、此次財政會議、不啻實行統制財政之初步也其目的在减輕田賦附加、廢除苛</p>
<p>捐雜稅、直接可以减輕農民負担、間接亦足提倡生產、實爲今日救濟農村經濟不可少之步驟也、</p>
<h3>救濟農村</h3>
<p>孔部長對於此次會議之提案、亦盡情容納、爲現有中央印花稅、爲數不少、當此財政拮据、羅掘俱窮之時、竟肯毅然劃撥地方應用、其態度之誠懇、可見一般、惟上述提倡生產之目的、關係複雜、固不僅减輕農民負担、卽可辦到、蓋農民所缺者、尤在流動資金、故救濟農村、提倡生產、尤貴科以低利長期之資金貸放農民、垂斃之農民、方有甦生之望、提倡生產之目的、亦可達到、現在無論爲學術界銀行界及政界中人、莫不異口同聲、高呼將者巿資金流入内地、故思想上可謂完全一致、</p>
<h3>投資内地</h3>
<p>事實上銀行界投資於内地者、已屬不少、如鐵路投資、汽車路投資、工業投資、電氣事業投資、隨處可見、各銀行又在内地廣設辦事處、直接對農民貸放欵項、提倡信用合作、買賣内地期票、無一非所以謀實現各方之希望、成績甚佳、金融界之舉措旣如此、政府當局亦應採一貫之政策、則力聚而</p>
<p>事易舉矣、卽就儲蓄資金而論亦應如是、使能盡量向内地投放、有裨於農村經濟者、豈淺鮮哉</p>
<h3>有奬弊多</h3>
<p>惟今日之有奬儲蓄則不然、不但不能使儲蓄之資金流入内地、其結果適相反、足使内地資金流向都巿、因内地愚夫愚婦、勤儉辛苦之結果、曾不足以保障其生活、於是皆存僥倖之心圖求非分、競相投機、農村經濟愈破產、其僥倖心亦愈甚、危險實甚、有獎儲蓄、實爲提倡僥倖心之尤者、絲毫不能獎勵節儉、且與正在厲行之新生活運動背道而馳、此亟宜禁止者一也、有獎儲蓄之資金、不但自農村流入都巿、與吾人之希望相反、且恐大部份流出海外、貽害我國實業者何可勝言、此亟宜禁止者二也、財部錢幣司徐司長對會議有强迫儲蓄之提案、所以提倡國人之節儉者、無微不至、對於假獎勵節儉之美名、而實行歛錢之有獎儲蓄、更應厲行制止、此其三、</p>
<h3>應加嚴密</h3>
<p>現在中央政府對於各銀行之辦理有獎儲蓄者、已嚴厲禁止、中外理應一律、何以一面早已實行、而一面反任其存在、且此種外商有獎儲蓄機關之設立、並無條約根據、而我畏葸不敢禁、殊所不解、此中有獎儲蓄基</p>
<p>金、以中法儲蓄會與萬國儲蓄會而論、巳達入九</p>
<p>千萬、其中萬國儲蓄會六千多萬、中法儲蓄會二三千萬元、增加之勢頗速、長此下去、將來多至數萬萬、勢力日盛、神通廣大、我政府更將有尾大不掉之虞、蓋引誘力更大、應付更難也、故此種有獎儲蓄、今更希望富有道德之政府當局、從速設法禁止、此其四、且有獎儲蓄盛行以後、眞正之儲蓄、不易發達、蓋國民之財力有限、豐於此者、必嗇於彼、故欲眞正儲蓄事業發達、不可不禁止有獎儲蓄、今兩家有獎儲蓄會、不但在通商口岸設舖經營、且廣設辦事處於内地、地方政府、亦應嚴加禁止、此其五、</p>
<h3>難再躊躇</h3>
<p>總之禁止有獎儲蓄、情節重大、須有四方面之人、同心恊力、方有達到目的之希望、（一）立法方面、（二）黨部方面、（四）與論方面、報紙卽爲輿論之代表、今立法輿論黨部各方當然皆立於反對地位、應阰合一致、督促行政方面切實進行才好、從前儲蓄資金、僅達兩三千萬時、鄙人巳大聲疾呼、竭力反對、面財政當局力主從長研究、遷延未辦、今則已達六七千萬、而財政當局仍未改其從長研究之故態、不知研究至於何時、方有結果、其中情形、誠非局外人所得知也、就吾個人所見、實無躊躇餘地、更希望日輿論界及國内學者、黨部與立法各方面、恊力同心、一致主張、使行政方從速進行、免貽後悔之譏、裨益農村經濟寗有涯矣、</p>

<p>等、於上月三十日、携帶來滬、訪晤國際電臺張工程師、將該機交下應用、</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>論「幽默」</h3>
<p>│││李求實君│││</p>
<p>「幽默」作何解？幽默文在文學域内領有否</p>
<p>它的位置？近來我們常常看到讀者們來信，如李求實君一樣，向我們提出這類的問題。他們因爲發見目前許多出版物，均載有幽默文的論戰文字，以致引起他們對這問题的興趣，同時，更感到需要有澈底的了解。我們，爲了適應讀者的要求，不能不提出來，給予一個簡單明瞭的解釋。</p>
<p>什麽呌做「幽默」？「幽默」原爲英文Ｈｕｍｏｒ的音譯，一般說，是含有諷刺和嘲笑兩種内容的。它是一種嘲笑的樣子，同時却又替那被嘲笑者悲哀；或者，雖然可笑，却能喚起理解和慈愛。所以，不含諷刺或敎育意味的嘲笑，便不能算作幽默。我們看到卓别靈那種怪模怪樣，固然可笑，但我們最不能忘記的是從他的模樣中襯托出來的那種濃厚的諷刺，我們看到中國舊劇中的小花臉，有時好笑，但我們最不容忽視的，還應該是它給與我們的那無形的警惕。没有幽默的實質，則卓别靈與小花臉的一切，便只有流於滑稽，流於無聊。</p>
<p>有些人把幽默當作保身養性的要訣，當成自己娛樂的玩意兒，於是認爲：不談宇宙，只談「蒼蠅」便是幽默。這道是一種誤解，甚至可以說是汚蔑了幽默。當然，從「蒼蠅」，並不是可可以認了社會的眞實的，不過我們要緊記住的，是談蒼蠅與談宇宙一樣，仍在探求眞理，仍在反眏現實的一面。顯然的，問題並不是在談「蒼蠅」或談宇宙，而在怎樣付僣那救育或諷刺的意義於嘲笑之中，我們所談的，是否盡了敎育或諷刺的任務，不然的話，空學會了扮着卓别靈的那付「尊容」，實際上，不過是低級趣味的胡調而巳。也有些人認爲「幽默」，只是胆小如鼠的紳士們玩的勾當。一般的大衆是不需要幽默的，他們要笑，，盡可以狂笑，他們要駡盡可以大駡，他們是用不着什麽客氣，這同樣是過於機械的見解，他們把大衆當作抽象的，當成千篇一律的東西看，而忽視了大衆的各種成分，需要各種不同的敎育；需要從正確的世界觀，和人生觀的表現中得到啓發。這樣怎能說大衆不需要幽默呢？無論對於什麽人，一種正面的諷刺，和規諫，是最易引起反感的，一有反感，則其效用必然要減少，如果我們把諷刺的内容，以柔和的笑語出之，則聽者旣感到舒適，無形中所受的影響，且一定比正面要來得深切。幽默，是敎育大衆的最好方法，它是一面鏡子，能指出各種缺點，和敎給如何改正那些缺點。幽默不是退避，而仍是進攻，側面的進攻。如上兩家的意見，只看到幽默的皮毛，而把幽默的本質看落了。</p>
<p>那末，在文學的領域内，是不是有它的位置呢？我們可决然的回答：是有的，幽默是構成喜劇的主要成份。在我們這時代，描寫出時代的苦痛的悲劇固然是必需，但是作爲敎育大衆的幽默的喜劇，實在有其更要意義。我們固不否認，目前所提倡的幽默，絲毫没有包含這意義，但决不能因此便否認幽默的存在，我們主要的，是在使幽默從滑稽無聊的變態中恢復它的本來面目，負起它的實際的任務。我們可以重說一遍，作爲敎育大衆的幽默文學是必然存在的！</p>

<h3>遠運會閉幕贅言　全國運動會可以世界紀錄爲標準　聯絡僑胞不重在遠運會存在與否</h3>
<p>（本報馬尼拉特約記者顔文初寄）</p>
<p>此番運動結束、田賽·徑賽·全能游泳·四項錦標、爲日本所得、網球因中間延期、現日選手已回國、卽作罷論、籃球·棒球·排球三項錦標、爲菲律賓所得　我國所得者、唯歷屆繼承唯一之足球錦標、論籃球·排球·我國實力亦不後人、徒以主客異勢諸多吃虧耳、棒球則實力未充、固難自諱、田徑·全能·游泳·則我方出席人數甚少、不過王季淮、張齡佳、陳寳球、符寳盧、劉長春等丨數人、雖陳寳球擲鐵球、符保盧撑竿跳、能得第二、其餘皆大敗特敗、總計第一日平均計算、日選手計得二十五分餘、菲選手得十六分餘、中選手祗得　分、第二日平均計算、日選手得三十六分餘、菲選手得二十七分餘、中選手祗得六分、游泳豫賽後卽不參仁决賽、最大原因、由彼兩方參加、多至數十人、且有幾項破從前紀錄、如全能運動、我國祗王季淮單身出馬、分數亦較前進步、此後無論遠東會已壽終止寢、我國健兒對以上數項運動、亦應有積極鍜鍊、始有參加世界運動機會、</p>
<p>我國全運五項運動冠軍郝春德、在塲始終并未參與比賽、據總敎練宣佈、謂其不服水土、身體違和、而第九屆遠運在日本舉行時、聞郝春德亦以手痛不克出賽、是眞所謂孤掌難鳴、又網球左手將軍林望蘇、爲全馬來半島之網球冠軍、一連數載、唯彼獨霸、曾在上海擊敗邱飛海、小挫林寳華、且此屆遠運日本網球選手佐藤太郎、以六比零、六比四、六比零擊敗邱飛海、於前年往歐道過星洲、曾與林氏小作比賽、被林氏以六比一大敗之、此番以華僑地位、排除一切、出席遠運欲爲祖國爭光、而隊長竟不予以出塲機會、徒使懷才莫展、鬰鬰空還、眞乃萬分可惜、</p>
<p>此番遠運會入塲劵收入結束除優待劵（該會幹事各國代表團人中員及各報記者）數近二千人外、其購券入塲參觀者、爲十二萬六千六百八十一人、收入劵資、計十萬七千餘元、比之一九二五年、第七屆亦在岷里刺舉行、僅收入四萬五千餘元、可見民衆對運動興趣、進步甚速、計此十萬餘元中、由我華僑供給者、在百分六十餘、而有此女游泳表演、名震中外之中國小姐美人魚楊秀瓊參加（中國小姐、乃菲人臨時加以尊稱、）中菲美士女、皆欲、瞻其丯采與態度、二日表演中、觀衆何止增加　萬、且在此游泳塲中、得五度見靑开白日旗飄揚、中國國歌出自菲憲軍音樂中者、楊女士誠爲中國爭得不少榮光也、楊女士計駐菲半個月、聞收得信件七百起、求簽名在其玉照者千餘起、一日楊女士往中華照像館照像、後隨二啞子菲人、指天畫地、出二五照求其簽名、女士笑許其請、大同俱樂讌會時、二菲少年强欲購買公讌劵云欲飽　諸女選手秀色爲商會辦事人所拒絕、聞一香港中年商家、並追求隨來、女士身關係我國運動界榮譽、此後大問題、非徒一身榮辱也、</p>
<p>遠運會因日菲朋比、私告解散、其蔑視我國、言之誠堪痛心、日方欲一手掩盡天下目、抱其私生子登堂、猶假詞曰、運動與政治無關、菲方亦步其語調、謂我國對僞國加入、太過認眞、但菲方我人亦須爲曲諒、猶憶四月間、在上海開圓桌會議以前、駐菲日領曾炎炎大言曰、菲律賓現方謀獨立、誠不宜對日本有所開罪、卽變相之哀的美敦書也、自美人在菲報紙武力鎭發表對斯會抱不平之言論、謂至　九四　年菲律賓或者爲滿洲之續有與在政界菲人友好者、私問曰、君謂斯言信否、彼云或者人此事勢、但總在社建省之後、我輩聞之、不睱哀人當急於自哀矣、</p>
<p>所謂運動能增進國際感情、或者爲政界與外交界之口頭語在他國吾不及知、若中國不論若何　乎、在菲律賓多　次運動比賽、華僑與在地中下社會、卽多一重惡感、蓋兩方觀衆、人數相當、勢不免爲戰勝者呐喊助威、或且出以難堪之譏笑、一語不能相容、則起而打架矣而運動員不守運動道德、動輙藉機傷人、與證人評判不公道、時起交涉、皆爲數見不鮮之事、故謂運動能增國際感情者、理論似是而事實則非也、</p>
<p>此後我國如欲鍜練强健體格、可全國劃爲東西南北中五區、分期進行、在年或三年間、開一次全國運動會、並請諸特别區域及海外若美屬法屬英屬荷屬各區埠華僑加入、以世界運動紀錄爲標凖、此亦聯絡華僑之一法是眞足增中外感情、固不重在遠運之存在與否也、</p>
<h3>江蘇敎育廳招集體育會議之由來　此會動機三點　會議期非止一日</h3>
<p>鎭江通訊、江蘇敎育廳定本月五日、招集省立學校體育會議、與會者除各學校體育敎員外、各位校長亦須到會、聞提案甚多、會議不止一日、會費由省府通過一千元、足見與普通會議有别、據記者所知、此會動機與最近省府視爲重要者有三點、（一）此次考察日本敎育團體回蘇感覺中國學生體力、不及日本遠甚、體力爲精神之母、無健全體格之國民、那裏會組織健全之國家、故學校體育須普及全校、不應僅僅注重少數運動學生身上、（二）省政府邇來發起騎射會、提倡者皆省府要人、現已收到會費八千餘元、射塲業巳動工、馬匹巳到京滬定購、足證省府提倡射御是與古之六藝（禮樂射御書數）相合、換言之亦所以濃厚民衆禮育的興會、（三）陳主席於上月二十二日招集全省會小學生在體育塲試騐禮儀、第一日敎育局先行預演、天氣稍暖、學生弱不禁熱、發痧倒地者甚多、第二日且有救護隊之預備、考騐結果、除少數學校禮儀合度精神充足外、其大都數則動作不敏捷、舉步目下視、尤足怪者、全體三千餘兒童之步伐、皆脚跟蹬地、一步距離不能以寸、一步時間不能以秒、震頭傷腦、兒童學校尙未健全、何以堪此、一般人認爲各小學敎師、於體育常識經騐太差、根本矯正、應在中學體育之改進、有此前後數因、故體育會議、遂具有嚴重性、屆時對於以上數點、必有重要提案、</p>

<h3>收音機靜默控制法</h3>
<p>— 一知</p>
<p>近來美國新式收音機中，除採用靈敏自動音量控制器外，復有靜默控制器，牠的功能，使收音機未接外來訊號之前，防止天綫上傳入一種雜聲，輸入於擴聲器而煩擾。</p>
<p>靜默控制器的原理，利用眞空管的乙類擴大法特性，卽使栅極受相當負電壓，則屏流截止，恰等於零，低放管遂失却工作效能，故栅極上稍受微雜吵聲，不能輸入於擴聲器而發音。今舉例以釋明，請視府圖。ＶＩ爲自動音量控制管，Ｖ２爲靜默調整管（Ｓｉｌｅｎｔ　ｔｕｎｉｎｇｔｕｂｅ）Ｖ３爲低週率强放管，Ｒ·Ｒ１，Ｒ２爲固定耗阻器。Ｒ３爲音量調節器，Ｒ４爲靜默調節器，當收音機開後而未接得外來訊號時，則自動音量控制器不生作用，Ｒ耗阻止遂無降壓，因此靜默調整管的控制栅極不受負電壓，（Ｒ１爲隔離耗阻無降壓作用）屏流甚大，Ｒ２耗阻降壓亦甚大。因之低週率强放管栅極受相當負壓，屏流就此截止，擴聲器不起發音。但若外來訊號來時，自動音量控制器卽司工作，Ｒ耗阻上有負壓存在，靜默調整管栅極受此相當負壓，屏流遂卽减少，Ｒ２耗阻降壓亦見减少，低放管栅極所受負壓旣小，屏流不致截止，司其放大工作。一方外來訊號由自動音量控制管整流後，於Ｒ耗阻上產生低週率電壓，經電容器Ｃ１至Ｒ３，調節適當音量，輸入於低放管，擴大至擴聲器，遂發生原來訊號，至Ｒ４靜默調節器之調節，因收受訊號有强弱，而天綫上傳入的雜聲亦大小不同，須經試騐，以調節至適當之處。</p>
<h3>如何改進架收音機丨加裝調節指示器</h3>
<p>— 庸言</p>
<p>新式收音機之面板上，每裝有一種可見的調節指示器（Ｖｉｓｕａｌ　ｔｕｎｉｎｇ　meter）。此物乃所以帮助調節者，庶得最大之音量與最淸晣之音質。其原理亦極簡單，係用一能指示電流强弱之儀，器置於一與收得電訊之强度有關係之電路中。普通均用靈敏之電流表，接連於一只或多只之高放眞空管之屏極回路内。當此眞空管未收得電訊時，則此電表所指示者，乃此眞空管在所用屏壓時之屏極電流。但當有電訊收得時，其屏極電流亦隨之變動：此屏流之變動愈大，卽調節愈爲合法也。此時接連於屏回路中之電表其指針當然隨電流之變動而移動，我人於調節時，但須使此指示電表之指針轉動最大，卽得最大之音量與最佳之聲調。</p>
<p>無極外差式及有自動音量調節之收音機，若調節不得法，其音質甚爲惡劣，故調節指示器實甚需要。若收音機之面板上有相當大小之地位而欲加裝一只調節指示器者可照附圖加裝之。只須將高放級眞空管之屏回路折開，照圖加一直流千分安培卽成。但經過此電表之電流，不可大於此表可量之最大電流；同時接入時正負不可弄錯，否則指針將倒指。</p>
<h3>再談新式懐中收音機</h3>
<p>— 鑑村</p>
<p>本刋前期（第六十四期）中載有思廉君所發表之新式懷中收音機，因圖中未註明所須機件之數値，且機中動作之原理亦未述及，日來蒙讀者紛紛來函見詢，除分函答覆外，特再將機中所須另件之數値，及其動作原理重述於交，以補前篇之不足。</p>
<p>Ｒ7＝１ｍｅｇ·ｎ　Ｒ8＝１５００ｎＲ9=2300n　R10=330nＣ14＝０、０００　　Ｒ1＝１、５ｍｃｇ、ｎＲ2＝１ｍｃｇ·ｎＲ3＝０ｍｃｇ·ｎＲ4＝１、５ｍｃｇ·ｎＲ5＝１·５ｍｃｇ·ｎＲ6＝０·３ｍｃｇ·ｎＣ5＝０·０２　　Ｃ6＝４０ｕｆＣ7＝０·００、５ｕｆＣ8＝０、００６ｕｆＣ9＝0、007ufＣ10＝0、005ufＣ11Ｃ12=8、5ufL1=3、4mh（40n）·L2=0、27mh（10n）L3L4=0、28mh（3、5n）L5=5、3mh（un）Ｃ＝C10C2=0、00032mhＣ　=0、00026　Ｃ　＝0、037mh　　綫路方式；本機所用綫路如第一圖所示，其所用另件之數値亦列舉於圖下，唯第一圖所示者，與思廉君所發表者略有出入，蓋思廉君所用之綫路係適用於解釋原理，而本圖乃其實際之綫路。所用綫路方式並無特異之處、唯以兩只眞空管當作四管式之功用，動作順序卽爲射電週率一級　大，檢波，來復成音週率二級放大。茲更詳述於下。</p>
<p>天綫電路係使用Ｃ14（天綫用固定電容器）及Ｌ1（天綫用初級綫圈）以爲串聯配諧，唯Ｃ14之容量稍大，且由Ｌ1之一端約作一回之綫圈以與射電週率放大之配諧電路相交連。</p>
<p>射電週率放大檢波，來復成音週率放大等作用係由一只６Ｆ7號式管兼司之之</p>
<p>。射電週率放大之配諧電路爲由Ｃ1及Ｌ3而成，係一種完且獨立之電路，與6Ｆ7號式管中五極管部控制栅極電路中之Ｌ2綫圖作密交連，卽Ｌ2與Ｌ3捲繞於同一圓筒上是也。經６Ｆ7管五極管部所放大之射電週率通過Ｃ6後與同管三極管部之栅極相交連。該配諧電路爲Ｃ2Ｌ4再由Ｃ3R5以作栅檢波。檢波後之成音週率電流卽流於三極管部之屏極電路，而在Ｒ3之兩端引起成音週率電壓，該電壓通過Ｃ4而回復於五極管部之控制栅極，以司成音週率放大作用完成其來復式的電路。此後該成音週率電壓又由普通的耗阻交連而供給於12Ａ７號式管中五極管部之控制栅極，經其放大以後卽輸入</p>
<p>於擴聲器而動作。</p>
<p>12Ａ7號式管中之二極管部乃作爲一整流管而司整流作用，耗阻Ｒ9用以代替</p>
<p>濾波用之阻流圈，而濾波用之電容器Ｃ12Ｃ13則各採用３、ｕｆ之値。</p>
<p>該收音機之所以異於他機者，乃在於6Ｆ7輸入綫路用誘導交連方式。此項綫圈係用特殊之綫繞製，綫之中心爲一硬線，而其周圍具有九根互相絕緣之撚綫。其中心之硬單綫卽用爲栅綫圈，與配諧電容器相連接，其外九根之撚綫則連接於眞空管之輸入栅極。又該機因力求小形之故，所用可變電容器，製造亦與普通不同，其餘另件，亦力避笨重。另件數値，均註明於圖下，茲不多贅。</p>
<h3>用兩雙33的收音機</h3>
<p>— 朱紫源</p>
<p>爲了内地没有日電的關係，交流機却是始終盛行不起來，除了幾個研究同志在試騐裝置以外，簡直百不得一，因此直流機得以充塞内地，而尤以省電式爲最，所以30，31，32，33，等眞空管在吾邑松江是要算銷路最好的。</p>
<p>一個３０檢波，兩個３０低放的配合方法，漸被淘汰了，最近一個３０檢波，一個，３３强低放的配合，非常盛行，原因是開辦費簡省，地位經濟，而音量反較兩個３０低放有過之而無不及，所以大家都樂於裝置，但自以３３檢波單管放刺叭綫路在報章上發表以後，大家又棄舊迎新的裝置起來，作者也屬試裝之一，但試騐結果，在松江，收上海一百瓦特的還好，電力小的，音量不足，效力是不及一個３０檢波３３强低放的來得好，所以我又加上一級用３３的强低放，成功了兩隻３３的收音機，結果却是一鳴驚人，牠的響度遠非３０檢波３３低放的所能及，曾經拿至閙巿，把喇叭入在一家親戚的店舖門口，在十數門面外，便可聞得，其響度足與一交流五燈機相比擬、現在裝的人又多了，作者曾替親戚裝過兩雙，同志蔡君亦替人裝過數隻，效果都很好，從未失敗，因此敢在本刋介紹，請同好們都來試試。</p>
<p>如圖是一級再生式檢波　，加一級低放，並無特異之處，另件容量均註圖中，讀者可以參閱，所當注意者，就是Ｃ電問題，因爲此處强力輸出以後，再有一級强力變壓交連低放，故極易引起失眞之弊，對於Ｃ電須有極精細之調節，方始有良好成績，這裏135Ｖ·不過是槪數，讀者須加多或减少試試，以得不失眞而最强之音量。</p>
<p>此機因用變壓交連低放，所以聲音極響，但是失眞的機會也比較多些，所以這裏對於Ｃ電非常重視，請讀者不可忽略，我想如果用電阻交連低放，音量雖然要减低些，失眞的機會，或可没有，諸位有閒，也不妨試試！</p>
<h3>無綫電談屑</h3>
<p>— 之蕃</p>
<p>短波之越程現象，據某無綫電界老前輩言，我國境内並無此現象，十五瓦特以上短波發報機，全國卽能暢通無阻：究其原因，殆爲我國氣候，濕度極高之故歟。</p>
<p>隔洋通信每較陸地通讯爲優，但潛水艇在水面下六十呎，僅通長波：百呎以下，完全不通。其原因如何，迄未能圓滿解答也。</p>
<p>乾電式三十二號眞空管，爲簾栅式强力放大及檢波管。其工作情形，極不一律。故應用時，須特别注意其簾栅格之電壓，試以各種電壓（自二十二個半　　至六十七個伏脫）求其最適當之値。欲　於書籍式雜誌上之言，必難得好結果。　此項眞空管，在一般再生式綫路中，用作檢波時，不如用三十四號效力好，諸君可一試之。</p>
<p>交涉眞空管245，爲新出之强力放大管，在鄙人試騐之下，覺其效力，不見比四十七式者優良多少，且頗易損壞。Ｂ電係用二百五十弗打者，今改爲二百二十弗打，音量不减，當能較爲耐用矣。</p>
<p>舶來收音機，因其競售巿塲之中，及迎合國人心理，每减低其售價，則質的方面，亦必因之而降低。我國氣候比較潮濕，尤以黃霉之時更甚，機内之變壓器，濾波電容器，炭質電阻等，亦因之而絕緣性减低，以至損壞，結果每烘壞機體如眞空管等，損失不資。卽幸而不損壞，則雜聲嘈囂，收音成績，一落千　丈。此可爲貪便宜者戒！</p>

<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>只在太后偶然轉一個念頭，忽而想聽一回音樂，這些樂工就得立卽吹吹打打的演奏起來。這還是屬於臨時發動的。平時又有幾次刻板文章似的固定演奏。譬如像太后在路上的時候，每一次上車，下車，都免不掉要奏樂的；再像太后在宫禁以内，乘着鸞輿往各處行動，無論怎樣的頻繁，可是當伊每一次上轎的時候，這班樂隊都得在旁吹打着，待伊發出了起駕的命令，那鸞輿開始行動了，這樂聲才得停止。樂聲一停，這些樂工又得馬上把他們樂器收拾起來，却不准乓乒乓乒的發出大的聲響丨急急忙忙的打另外一條路上抄到前面去，先在太后所要到的目的地上候着，待伊一到，便又吹打起來，作爲迎接的意思。這些人因爲怕悞事起見，往往趕得非常的迅捷，可是太后的鸞輿在路上行動時的速率，總和龜步一樣的慢，所以從來也没有趕不上過。而這種情形，看</p>
<p>起來便格外的像尋常人家所舉行的葬儀一樣了！</p>
<p>這班樂隊一起共有十二個人，當然，他們也都是太監。他們照例各戴着一頂緯帽，可是他們的緯帽却比那些抬鸞輿的太監們所戴的我出一條红纓，各人的服式是十九相同的。他們都有一件馬夾，顔色是桃紅的，不過上面並無什麽花樣紥繡着。他們的長袍是紫紅色的，看出眞是異常的鮮艷。他們相沿下來，每一個人都有一個助手，這倒並不是無意識的擺闊主義，實在因爲他們是太忙了，倘没有一個助手相帮。他們自己的確是照顧不周的。（四七）</p>
<h3>情書</h3>
<p>— 子云</p>
<p>我有一位同事，新近接到一封信。信封上的姓名住址，完全都對，但拆開一瞧，倒弄得目定口呆，因爲那封信，是一封情書，而且是寫給女子的。信裏的大意是，「别後，想念得甚麽似的，幾每晚都做夢。昨天約在××戲院相會，等了二個鐘頭，没有會到，爲甚麽忍心至此？收到这信，若在二十四小内，，不給回信的話，要凖備跳黃浦了、」同事由下面的署名，而斷定這是一位朋友把信封套錯了，閙出了這麽個笑話，於是立覆一信，冒用那位女子的芳名，而約他在黃浦灘相會。豈知信去之後一天，又來了一信，却是商量借錢的。這位朋友！也眞粗心透了頂，會把情書與借錢信，套錯信封。</p>
<p>從前我有一位朋友，某一交，寫了二封信，一封是寄給女友的情書，一封是寄給交親的家書。不料是一時糊塗，裝錯了信封，把情書寄給了次親，把家禀寄給子女友，一時朋友之間，都引爲笑話的資料。豈知他這二封信，都是與婚姻問題的關的。他的父親，見他巳有了女友，所以便停止了替他在鄕間擇偶，而他的女友，見他反對父母作主，也很順利的和他訂婚了　所以我那朋友倒是因誤得福。但是他的粗心，眞與我同事的朋友，無獨有偶。</p>

<h3>駡人的藝術</h3>
<p>— 醉痴生</p>
<p>上海有兩句俗語：呌做「寗可聽蘇州人相駡，弗要聽寗波人白話。」足見駡人的藝術，要推素以「吳儂軟語」著名的蘇州人，最爲擅長了。有位觀欽君，前在某報記一則「糖佛手」的笑話。他說：蘇州人駡人，要算船戶最拿手，往往使人聽了不懂。有位朋友在河邊小便，餘溺濺及某船戶的船梢。船婦見而駡道：「倷格隻是糖佛手㖸。」那朋友聽了，還莫明其妙。後來人家告訴他，方知駡的是「堂弗收。」因爲從前重犯伏法後，須暴屍數日，善堂弗來收。其駡人的深刻有如是：依在下看來，其次要算吃堂子飯的人了。在下有位朋友，很喜歡跟人家逛妓院，但從來不肯破鈔。因此鴇婦時常說他是「墳墩頭浪格新官人。」人家聽了，都有些不懂。後來大家揣想　　大約說他是「想發懨，死要出風頭。」的意思。還有見了「木林式」的客人，伊們呌做「屋頂頭浪格菩薩。」聽了好像是尊稱之詞：其實說你是「瓦老爺。」像這種「猜謎式」的駡人藝術，眞是何等的高明啊！</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>

<p>第二十九回</p>
<p>回柬足傷心自標獨活</p>
<p>聽　同歃血共誓精忠</p>
<p>自强紅臉道：我憑怎麽不是進，一個公私總分得出來，我怎能够在這個吃緊的時候還念着家，只是……他</p>
<p>只說了這兩個字，把話就頓住了。他雖是頓住了，站在他面前的殷得仁，就很知道他這話說不下去。若要通着問他，也是讓他更爲難，就没有向下說什麽。這不但殷得仁心裏明白，營長寳芳，這時在外面散步解除胸中的積悶，隔了一個女角，也把這話聽去了。心裏想着，速起自强都不能忘去兒屋之情，這仗怎打！心裏，想着，脚下順便的走，不覺走到田靑這一連連本部來，這裏牆上有個窟窿眼，將紙糊着，當是窗戶，便向裏面看着，只見他翹了兩腿，直睡在坑上，手上捧了一張相片在看。相片上是什麽人雖不可得而知，可是看到他看過之後，又把相片在臉上親着兩下，分明是對女子相片的行爲。心裏更覺這一種動作　比趙自强那種行爲，更要進一步。於是又回轉身去，兩手背了在身後，只管走着。他走到了路的盡頭，迎面是圍牆擋了去路，這才猛可的抬起頭來。當他抬起頭來的時候，鼟鼟鼟一陣軍鼓聲，在面前嚮着。看時，原來是兩個年輕號兵，站在太陽光裏，練習着打軍鼓。一個掛了鼓在胸前，比了鼓槌子打着。一個將脚打了拍子，口裏唱着軍號的調子，只看他兩手擺得很起勁，已是忘了一切。寳芳看了許久，他猛一回頭看到營長才行了軍禮站定，寳芳笑道：好小子，你行，快開火了，你提起一點精神來。那號兵道：要什麼緊，該死活不了，該活不了。（三九八）</p>
<h3>看燈追記</h3>
<p>— 柯定盫</p>
<p>在二十三年春暮的時候，偶然地感到不舒適，竟至無力，後來連飯也不想吃了，於是請得了幾天病假，回到新巿去養病。　　却巧那時候！三十日至十一日丨新巿的許多人，正忙着：「新生活運動提燈會」，說起了提燈會，在近處的已有瀏河，太倉，沙頭，橫涇，羅店，南翔，婁塘，嘉興，硤石等處，各有各的盛况，各有各的好處，我們新巿的燈會，是夙著盛名的，别處的燈，是以紙張爲主要物，再加以人工的製作而成；新巿的燈則不然，它的主要物，是以明晶石，（一名千層紙，屬礦物，）用細工層層剔開鋪平，用烙鐵慢慢熨平。再加細工製作而成，！明晶石熨平的面上，再用彩色紙鏤出各種合度的圖案，丨所以一般鑒賞的人，都說是新巿的燈，比别處的來得精巧，以最近來說，在十六年前出過一次，十三年前，又出過一次，那時候，我年紀還小，所得的印像還没有多大深刻，以後，也没有出過，今年，盛行着新生活運動，新巿人不甘落人之後，分社醵資，各出奇巧，兩個月以前，就凖備起來，據說其中有幾個名貴的佳作，曾化費三四千工的人力，最少的也得幾十工，就是手裏可提的輕巧小作品，也得二三十工，纔能竣事，這樣看來，可以知道新巿「燈」的價値了。</p>
<p>生了病的我，一點精神没有的，在三月十日第一次舉行燈會的晚上，看了一個飽，這次的出品，開頭有新巿民衆敎育館的新生活運動的標語燈，洪福社的大香鼎，（大的程度，和上海城隍廟的大鼎一般，）大聚寳盆，都是用明晶石製成的，鼎和盆的肚子，直徑足有六十英寸，你想用小小的明晶石製成，他的工夫當然不少，長庚社的六角富貴亭，鯉魚跳龍門，也是極有意味的作品，富貴亭裏，有郭　儀的活動機關，行動時大有：「富貴令人思」之感，跳龍的鯉魚，一跳一跳的好似眞的一般，它們的外框和一切小燈彩，全是明晶石熨成，精緻非常，永潛社永安社各製一艘大龍船，船内人物極多，都能轉動，龍頭上的雙眼，一閃一閃的顯得威嚴可怕，保寗社的銀河橋，是表演牛郎織女的傳說，翻竿燈，是先紥好一個很高的有格子的（大槪有三行，每行十一格）竹架，在每一個格裏，掛一個不同樣的燈彩，那三十三個不同樣的燈，齊明着的豎起，着實好看啊，合作社的絲廠，理髮社的油車，各個的機關動作，有異曲同工之妙，寗河社的廣寒宮，據說化上三千多工纔成功的，精細的程度，自能别樹一幟，萬安社鳳儀亭，遊戲亭，各有是處，保安社的海巿蜃樓，别有會心，新奇之至，醒獅社的大獅子，碩大無朋，新巿狹小的街道上，差不多祇好壞着那獅子走了。其他如大凉傘，小凉傘，大小花籃……等等，各社都有出品，尤其是凉傘，它的周圍，都是用彩紙照六角或八角製成，有兩節或三節的，在彩紙上。用小針剌出相稱的山水，人物，蟲魚，鳥獸及古代圖案，映在燈火之前，就能看到新巿人針工的精妙，還有不少引人入勝的燈，都費了不少精力纔成就的，恕我不能枚舉了。</p>
<p>在每社之首，各有　組絲竹，或繩鼓，以助興趣。（新巿人的絲竹，本來很好，這次更見佳妙。）</p>
<p>這一次的看客，來自滬杭國道，嘉蘇水道以及附近各鄕鎭的老幼男女不下數萬人，可說是空前盛况，酒菜店及點心店，生涯頓盛，不過燈巿過後，依然冷落街頭了，但是話又說回來了，當此蠶事正忙之事，鄕下人當然不能出來在街頭間逛，這止是冷落的時機啊！所望今年全國農民得到些慰安，那麽農村經濟得以稍見起色啊！</p>

<h3>應該怎樣說呢？</h3>
<p>— 白戈</p>
<p>事總是愈說愈淸楚，理總是愈辯愈明白，這應該是兩句很直的話吧。然而，目下的情形却不一樣：許多的事事，到是不說也還淸楚，愈說反愈糊塗；不辯也還明白，愈辯反愈混沌。</p>
<p>爲什麽會如此呢？</p>
<p>這，自然，也許由於事理本身不容易爲人所淸楚和明白之故。事是有各色各樣的，理是可道來道去的，如果更以宇宙之大來說，那包含着一切事理的宇宙原來就在時時變化和矛盾，所以許多的事理也就不得不被一些各自固有一定的地位的人們愈說愈糊塗，愈辯愈混沌了。</p>
<p>不過，這種糊塗和混沌底來源，却正在一些各自固有一定的地位的人們底</p>
<p>身上。事雖然有各色各樣，然而總有一個樣子，而且各有各的樣子；理雖然可道來道去，然而總要道得過去，而且可道的亦不多，卽以時時都在變化和矛盾的宇宙來說，而那種變化和矛盾就是它本身所賴以生存的法則，只要不經過一些各自固有一定的地位的人們爲了一定的利益故意地加以淆亂和歪曲，不待說它底三身究竟是很淸楚明白亦很容易爲人所淸楚明白的。</p>
<p>可是，許多的糊塗和混沌便老是從一種故意地淆亂和歪曲中發生。</p>
<p>譬如說吧，我們底聰明的文壇上，至今還留着一種像這樣的論戰方式：你說他那個人如何不好呢，他就說你憎惡人類，使全人類都與你爲敵；你說他那種小品文如何不好呢，他就說你否定一切小品文底存在，將摧殘文化的罪名輕輕地加在你底頭上。甚而至於還有些人引申曲義，說你之反對小品文，完全是由於「對於小總覺得看不入眼」。</p>
<p>其實呢，這個意思到是有最大的錯處的。很顯明的反證就是：那些攻擊小品文的人，他攻擊小品文的傢伙，也是小品文，不過是不同的另外一種罷了。至於所謂小之不被中國人重視，那更不是一切的事實：「小姐」和「大姐」誰被重視呢？矮小的日本人不是在中國橫行雖有力者亦莫可如何嗎？高大的印度人不是在被我們嘲駡爲阿三嗎？可見得話還應該另外說過。</p>
<p>那末，應該怎樣說呢？</p>
<h3>各盡所能</h3>
<p>— 致立</p>
<p>「以差觀之，因其所大而大之，則萬物莫不大；因其所小而小之，則萬物莫不小。知天地之不稊米也，知豪末之爲丘山也，則差數覩矣」。</p>
<p>這種議論，雖然似乎近於玄虛，其實是眞理。看事實就知道，東北四省之亡，列强備戰之亟，該是國家世界之大事罷，然而在多數人心目中，何嘗把這些當作重大，他們所當作重大的倒是蒼蠅，蟋蟀之類。更有許多人，甚至並不相信那些大事的存在，只相信與本身有關的瑣屑是眞實，這把下面的幾句話也證實了：「以功觀之，因其所有而有之，則萬物莫不有；因其所無而無之，則萬物莫不無」。　　對事情的看法如此，那麽做起文章來怎能兩樣？三閒集」中有一篇文章說，作者在某種環境中，心坎裏發生了「世界苦惱」似的哀愁，但一被蚊子所叮，馬上就消失了，所以他說：「雖然不過是蚊子的一叮，總是本身上的事來得切實。能不寫自然更快活，倘非寫不可，我想，也只能寫一些這類小事情，而還萬不能寫得正如那一天所身受的顯明深切。而况千叮萬叮，而况一刀一槍，那是寫不出來的」。</p>
<p>近來小品文之所以旺盛，也是作者們的意識範圍狹小的結果，這本是無可如何的事情。不過和作八股文是不同的，八股文是談聖賢之道的大文，其題材是在「經書中割截出若干小塊」來，其思想也不能超出經書之外，不是作者自己的，這眞是「束縛人心，禁制思想」的勾當。現在的小品文的作法，不見得也是如此的。倘若定要說現在的小品文等於八股文，則那八股文决不是「試士」的一類，而是另一類。坊間通行的石印本「西廂記」後面，往往附着唐寅的十六篇八股文，是以「西廂記」每齣中的一句曲文爲題的，這和現在的有一類小品文，方纔有點相似，但在形式上仍然拘束得多。</p>
<p>古代「試士」，於八股之外，還有「策問」，亦曰「對策」，那所問對的可是關於政治經濟的大問題了，所以也是大文章。然而這些大文章中也少有好的，爲什麽呢？没有實際的考察研究，對策的根據，只是幾本經史子集，故架子雖大，内容還是空虛的。</p>
<p>什麽事情都不能一槪而論，做大題固然是好的，做小題也未必全是白費氣力。泰山不壤土壤，河海不擇細流，小的事物，對於大的也許不無助益，至少，是可以並存而無碍的。世人大抵爲才力所限，有的人只能幹小事業，做小題目。倘有看不起這些的大才。自己去幹大事業，做大題目的就是，那時「大小欣欣」，社會就要熱閙得多，文化也要進步得快了。</p>
<p>看今日中國，根本什麽也没有，無論那一種事業，一起頭就會遭大議論的責難而歸於滅亡，而大議論者自己也並不幹大事業。這現象是不好的，我以爲今日作事，還以「各盡所能」爲最要。</p>

<h3>「味水軒日記」（下）</h3>
<p>— 殊</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>系統的紀遊日記，在「味水軒日記」中，主要的可節出三篇，「是遊齊雲記」，一是「遊白嶽記」，一是「武林記」。日記中之紀遊文字，此三記可作代表。片段的說，如「齊雲記」所云，「盡日行兩山合沓間，一峯吐雲，一峰送日，夾路野松，雨蒸日炙，香氣撲人，衣袖爲沾漬者，撚之皆有龍麝氣」。如「氣候新晴，愈覺澄朗，　諸峰曉色澄　，拖藍日光射之，遠者如半空朱旗，近者如塗金錯繡，丹楓蒼檜，點綴其間，萬壑屯雲，千流漱玉，到此又思李昭道公子盡法不爲虛設，大小米如中書堂，淡瀋判押，絜其總領而巳」。描寫景物變幻，極生動之能事，文字也很明快。「禮白嶽記」，則大抵記錄道里人事，友朋會晤，書畫訪問，無特殊特色，惟「杭行」一記，短而有文。書中所述杭行次數甚多，只此番遊事較勝。乙卯七月十日云：「熱甚，晚譚孟恂以小舫具酒樏拉余與兒子同泛，從藕花居荷葉深處，沿溯進内六橋，出三橋，抵湖心亭。團坐石臺，時璧月漸吐，淸風乍來，煩暑濯然滌去。歸舟，抵掌談詩，指點孫太初舊隱處，爲之慨然」！十五日云，「自蘇堤北望斷橋，水　浮燈萬　，焛燦如金。杭人貧不能葬者，行徑抛骨斷橋水中，而俗　中元孟闌　事，至是士女傾城夜泛，湖中大小船無不受雇者，迨明乃止。然亦只東北半壁如沸，若湖南，寂寂一片月光，照踏歌數輩而巳。回時至浴鵠灣小住，孟恂指一敗屋，在烟樹中，云，此金華唐汗甫所寓，日閉戶燒金液大丹，不知成否？因柯約叚時訪之。」寫湖上景物，民間風習，夜遊勝况，動人處，不亞「夢尋」，惜乎此類紀述，在李日華日記中，殊不多見耳</p>
<p>五</p>
<p>李日華日記，尙有特殊風趣，終不得不再說到的，就是寫氣候的部分，或每日的簡單一二行的紀錄，有時極令人神馳。如寫鳥聲云，「八日，忽雨忽晴，氣候極佳，鳥聲如佛。」「九日。樹陰濃綠中，時作淅瀝小雨。日光在雲裏忽一閃露。無事坐美蔭軒聽鳥聲，極淸適」。「八日。細雨蒸溽，髹器皆如汗流，鳥聲不止」。所記不過十數語，顧一種閒適生涯，詩人意趣，透露紙背矣。又如，「二十一日。梅花已狼藉，薺菜可挑，從此春事日拍拍矣」。「三日。程客範畫眉鳥來饋，適姻家張姓者貽百合一盆，挺三十六花，以漸開敷，從此終日在花香鳥語間」，意境文字，均可深味。然而，無論你怎樣的企圖逃避人世，由於生活的連繫，事實上是不可能，李日華雖不愁衣食住，但也終於免不了有人世的憤慨。談到人事，他是不免「爲之俯仰太息」，在另一天裏，且長論的說「連日爲人排解紛難，覺此世界憑腹臆者，任意縱橫，負角距者，必恣踶觸，波浪險巇，可畏可懾，乃知古人退步讓步，眞大熱惱中一杯甘露也。沈子廣來，與擘蟹對飲，語此更覺添味。」這不僅可以看到他的憤慨，他的生活所以然走向隱逸，也可以推測到了。（完）</p>
<h3>跳梯（五）</h3>
<p>— 草明</p>
<p>晚上，半睡着的阿漢那被疲乏毒壞了的肢體，粗野而笨重在壓在那疲弱的女人身上，女人因呼吸得不舒服而低呌着：</p>
<p>「當心呀，我巳經三個月没有經水來了，不要把……」</p>
<p>「當眞麽？」男人給歡快充滿了，身子因過分的小心而歛縮起來。</p>
<p>太陽已偏向西方了，光亮從田邊的小茅屋的背後撒過來，茅屋底門前印了一個灰黯的不規則的四方形的陰影；一個老婦人跟一個燒猪皮色的背膊的靑年男人在這陰影底下蹲着。</p>
<p>「一定是這樣的咯，」老婦人低着頭捲紙烟，「聽說鄧師爺底父親也是一個窮光棍，他母親」懷着他的時候丨丨你曉得她是很虔誠的哪丨丨她在九月十九「觀音　誕」那天跳梯了………你…</p>
<p>看現在鄧師爺多闊氣多能幹呀！」老婦人瞇著希望的眼睛凝視著禾田。</p>
<p>「跳梯，呌我們那阿梅跳梯？丨丨」男人没有决心地，吃嗒着說。</p>
<p>「算了，算了，懂事的女人常常不顧這些的。三叔婆和四娘都說我想得好主意哩……我們不能讓窮苦纒繞我們底子孫的。後一代要緊呀！」老婦人强硬地，急速地說了。結果，帶着得勝的微笑走回去。</p>
<p>六月十九那天，阿漢屋外起了一種嚴肅的等待底哄動。兩三個女人穿了齊整的衣服，臉孔略帶點焦急，探進半邊身來，小心地問：</p>
<p>「事情通通都弄好了麽，四嬸娘？」</p>
<p>「唔，對呀，你先把菓盒香燭搬到廟裏云吧阿漢……」老女人像一只草蜢樣跳躍着，怱促地說着。</p>
<p>「吃了這口聖水吧」，婆婆捧住了一碗從去年「七月七」那天留到現在的敬過「七姐」的淸水，溫柔地對媳婦說。「吃過了，我跟你去拜觀音娘娘，在她神壇前跳梯，你一定養一個福相的兒子哩……」</p>
<p>阿梅茫然地跟着婆婆走到觀音廟來。附近圍繞着廟門的人們底鼓勵而尊敬的目光，使阿梅困惑了，她機械地，一分不差地聽着婆娘底指揮在跪拜着。</p>
<p>觀音廟底神壇前的一塊空地，兩張正方的杉木做成的桌子當中，夾着一把普通上神樓的木梯，再用草繩接上一把竹梯，像一個吃人的長脚的惡魔似地，怪僻而傲慢地站兩張方桌底合缝裏。許多人在桌傍撑持着。方桌邊還放了一張矮木凳。</p>
<p>一個「拜神婆」伏在空地上禱告了站起身來，虔誠地走近呆立着的孕婦面前說：</p>
<p>「漢嫂，踏上矮凳，爬上右面的桌子，然後一級一級地攀上去，跨過了最末那級，從左邊一級一級地爬下來，」老虔婆特别用勁地繼續說，「禀告大慈大悲呀，生個富貴的聰明的兒子，禀告大慈大悲呀！」</p>
<p>「我能够上得那麽高麽——」阿梅拖長着顫慄的聲音茫然的問，但没有人聽見她。</p>
<p>周圍的督促的眼睛和慫恿惡狗搏鬥似的嘶嘶的聲音使阿梅底恐怖麻木了。她敏捷地躍上凳子，跳上桌去，沿着梯一級一級地升着，她底脚下浮起了一片雜亂的讚美的么喝來。上到竹梯半腰的時候梯子上便柳樹般搖晃了；她繼續攀上去，下面瘋狂地呌起來：「賢德的女人呀，能幹的女人呀！……快了，只有兩級了，把身子翻過云呀！</p>

<h3>Preparatory Meeting to be Held Before the Opening of the Ping-Shen Through Train Service; Technical Personnel Draft Detailed Measures; All Procedures Still Awaiting Final Agreement</h3>
<h3>Japan Actively Preparing for Through Transportation</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Sino-Japanese technical meeting in Beidaihe concluded yesterday. Chen Qingwen, Chief of the Car Service Department, remained in Yunbin, while the other two department chiefs from the Engineering and Machinery Departments went to Qindao to inspect road administration. Wang Xuan, Chief of the Accounting Department, and Ye Duwen, Chief of the Inspection Section, returned to Tianjin from Beidaihe last night. Wang and Ye's task was to calculate the through train ticket prices and future profit sharing methods with the other party. Yu Youmei, the puppet Fengshan Railway Bureau Director, also attended the meeting at the seaside. Chen Qingwen and others are scheduled to return to Tianjin tonight to report to the Railway Bureau. The date for the opening of the Ping-Shen through train service will be no earlier than mid-month, as it requires the organization of an international travel agency and preparations for train operations. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It is reported that Yin Tong has left Beijing for the north. The date of his arrival in Tianjin has not yet been reported. It is rumored that Chinese and Japanese representatives will gather in Beiping to hold a preparatory meeting before the implementation of the through train service. All matters related to the organization of a Sino-Japanese international travel agency and through train service procedures are awaiting agreement. To ensure a central location, the meeting may still be held in Yuguan. (One-day special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Ping-Shen through train service was only discussed in principle at the Yuguan meeting. The details and specific measures have been entrusted to specialized technical personnel from each side for separate drafting. The final consultation and decision will be held in Ping. At that time, Ota, Director of the puppet Fengtian Railway Bureau, and specialized personnel such as Abe Kyozo and Furusawa Katsuo will come to Ping to participate. Currently, the Japanese have allocated four locomotives from the South Manchuria Railway for use by the puppet Fengshan Railway. A large number of train cars have been arriving at the former Chezhan station outside Yuguan in recent days. To date, more than fifty South Manchuria Railway-labeled trains are parked at Yuguan Station, ready to depart at any moment. It is widely rumored in Yuguan that South Manchuria Railway trains will begin running on the Beining Railway in the coming days, handling through transportation matters inside and outside the pass. The Japanese have established an information office at Yuguan Station and are responsible for handling through transportation matters. The South Manchuria Railway is actively handling through freight from various places in the Northeast, transporting all agricultural products to the interior for sale. The method is to use the South Manchuria Railway's through transportation system, establishing a responsible through transportation system directly connecting various places, and reducing freight rates. Furthermore, they have formulated a warehouse delivery and receiving system. The receiving addresses are designated as Dalian Pier, Xiaogangzi Station, Yingkou, and Andong. However, the puppet Fengshan Railway cannot apply this system, so the Japanese have recently decided to set up a receiving address in Yuguan to facilitate through transportation.

<h3>Guangdong and Guangxi Authorities Separately Send Telegrams to Beijing Denying Rumors; Huang Shaoxiong Decides to Return to Guangxi</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a certain news agency, rumors have recently been rampant in the Southwest. Central Guangdong officials Zhu Zhaoming, Sun Ke, etc., have telegraphed Chen Jitang to inquire about the truth of the rumors, and incidentally explained the central government's future foreign policy. Interior Minister Huang Shaoxiong and Vice Minister Gan Naiguang also telegraphed Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi of Guangxi Province to inquire. It is now learned that Chen, Li, and Bai have already sent replies yesterday, declaring solemnly to various central officials that the two provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi, under the guidance of the central government, are pursuing bandit suppression and construction in accordance with the principle of separation of military and political affairs. External rumors are not credible. It is heard that Chen also sent a separate telegram to Chairman Jiang making a similar statement. Li of Guangxi also expressed the wish for Interior Minister Huang Shaoxiong to return to Guangxi to discuss various issues. It is heard that Huang has decided to return south to inspect the autonomous situation in several southwestern provinces, but the date of departure has not yet been determined. (One-day dispatch)</p>
<h3>President Wang's Remarks on Diplomacy: No Decisions Made on Through Train or Mail Service; Foreign Policy Towards Japan Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) President Wang of the Executive Yuan went to the mausoleum on the morning of the 1st to attend the fifth anniversary of the burial of the Premier. According to him, his diabetes has recently flared up slightly. Dr. Nord diagnosed him and he is taking medication. The sugar content has gradually decreased, and he still needs to inject once every morning. The doctor said that there is no major problem, but it is difficult to eradicate in a short time. As of this morning, he has not received a telegram from Huang Fu about when he will return to Ping. When he leaves Shanghai and returns north, he must pass through the capital and will hopefully be able to enter the city to meet him, but this is just his speculation, not Huang's fixed itinerary. Regarding the arrival of the Japanese ambassador in Beijing, it is customary for ambassadors to telegraph two or three days in advance of their visit to Beijing, but he has not yet received a telegram from Arima, so he must have been delayed in Shanghai for several days. This visit is a routine meeting and a social call that diplomats should have, and there are no special tasks. Someone asked about the conflicting rumors about through train and mail service, with some saying that it will be resolved locally. What is the real situation? Wang replied with a smile, "I am not aware of the rumors outside. If the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issue a statement, it is mostly speculation. The Japanese have indeed made this suggestion about through train and mail service, but we have not made any decisions. As for the saying that it will be resolved by local governments, I can responsibly answer that if through train and mail service can be realized, it cannot take effect unless the central government formally and carefully studies and makes a decision. If the local government can resolve it, my foreign policy towards Japan remains unchanged. As for through train and mail service, if it becomes a reality without undermining the principle of sovereignty, there is no so-called change in foreign policy." He was also asked about the Hong Kong newspaper report that the elder statesmen in the Southwest have been very critical of the central government. What does the central government think of this opinion? He replied that the elder statesmen in the Southwest have been scolding the central government since before today. After the January 28th truce agreement and the Tanggu Agreement, they scolded once after each one. Recently, with the issue of through train and mail service, these people are once again singing their high-pitched tunes as usual. At this time of national crisis, the whole country must unite sincerely to save the country. In his opinion, if the elder statesmen in the Southwest have good strategies to save the country, whether they advocate war or peace, they should be open and honest with each other and discuss them at length. Empty words and attacks are only futile. (One-day special dispatch)</p>

<h3>Swan Song of the Disarmament Conference</h3>
<p>— Jing</p>
<p>The Geneva Disarmament Conference, after Germany withdrew, was on the verge of stalemate. Although key figures mediated several times, the opposition between France and Germany could not be eased, and it was almost impossible to convene the conference. Later, thanks to the efforts of the United Kingdom and the urging of France and the Soviet Union, the conference was convened in Geneva on May 29. Sixty-four countries participated, and fourteen countries were represented by their foreign ministers. It can be described as a grand international event. However, judging from previous examples, for important international conferences, the main countries such as Britain and France were mostly represented by the prime ministers responsible for the overall situation. This time, only the foreign ministers were sent, which is inevitably slightly inferior.</p>
<p>Examining the process of the United Kingdom's mediation of the disarmament stalemate, it is clear that the crux of the European problem lies entirely in the opposition between France and Germany. The memorandum sent by the French government to the United Kingdom on April 17 still insisted on its so-called "absolute security guarantee," stating that without it, France would not reduce its armaments and could not promise Germany's demand for military equality. France has repeatedly stated this position since Germany withdrew from disarmament on October 14 last year. Germany, however, has refused to yield in the slightest. Hitler has raised the banner of opposition to the Treaty of Versailles, vigorously promoted the slogan of the Third Reich, and tried to incite the German people's psychology of revenge. Although its strength may not be enough to tear up the treaty immediately, it is indeed a powerful preparation for breaking the status quo. France cannot but be vigilant, and the small countries of Central Europe, which are France's satellites, cannot but be afraid.</p>
<p>Under this state of unease, French diplomacy has maintained its composure. However, the smaller countries have become increasingly aware of their own vulnerability. Therefore, from Poland to the Little Entente countries in the Danube basin, there has been discontent with France and a desire to seek self-defense elsewhere. Austria and Hungary have clearly cooperated with Italy. As a result, the French authorities have been forced to insist on self-defense. However, it has not neglected the countries of Central Europe. Its foreign minister, Barthou, after visiting Poland, visited the countries of Central Europe to consolidate the Versailles system. The most noteworthy aspect is the Anglo-French relationship in the Franco-German opposition. France believes that if the United Kingdom wants to mediate the disarmament stalemate and enable Germany to participate in disarmament with reasonable satisfaction, it must at least cooperate with France to jointly guarantee its security. However, the United Kingdom believes that its position is that it will not take any joint action beyond the Treaty of Locarno. The United Kingdom does not want Germany to develop too rapidly and surpass the United Kingdom, nor does it want France to dominate Europe and threaten British hegemony. Therefore, there are hidden reefs between Britain and France that cannot be coordinated. In addition, the Italian struggle for hegemony, sometimes siding with France to suppress Germany, and sometimes helping Germany to attack the Treaty of Versailles to check France, and the small countries mixed in between, the disputes have become more intense. The future of disarmament is foreseeable. Although the general disarmament committee has been opened, judging from past situations and predicting the future, even the wise know that Henderson's hope for the reduction of land armaments, the conclusion of an air force convention, and the international management of the manufacture and sale of arms are just empty diplomatic gestures on the international conference table.</p>
<p>The reality of the disarmament conference has passed. The association between Britain and France and the Little Entente countries has been following the same path for more than ten years since the World War, and it is expected that they will continue to try their best to maintain the status quo. However, the most noteworthy aspect is the rapprochement between France and the Soviet Union. Before the Great War, France and the Soviet Union were allies. They only separated after the war. The superficial reason was the difference in the fundamental systems of the two countries. In fact, the internal reason for France's anti-Sovietism was the denial of the 200 million franc loan and the rapprochement between the Soviet Union, Germany, and Japan. The Third International also wanted to open up a revolutionary outlet in Western Europe, which made France even more fearful. The anti-Soviet movement became more obvious. Recently, times have changed. The Soviet Union has devoted all its efforts to domestic construction and has gradually relaxed its attention to world revolution. After Hitler came to power, the national movement became more intense, threatening to invade Russia from the east. Therefore, the Soviet Union turned its diplomatic spearhead to preventing Germany's eastward expansion policy. France is also deeply concerned that the small countries of Central Europe are not strong enough to resist Germany, and the United Kingdom is cunning and unreliable. It is trying to find another way to limit Germany. Therefore, the long-standing estrangement between the Soviet Union and France has allowed them to sing the praises of peace together, and there have been reports of a military alliance. At this time when the disarmament conference is only a swan song, will the center of gravity of international problems shift with the rapprochement between France and the Soviet Union?</p>

<h3>General Committee Meeting Yesterday: Disarmament Reaches a Critical Juncture; Discord Between Britain and France Cannot Be Resolved; Meeting Adjourned to Next Tuesday</h3>
<p>Delegate Gu Expresses Deep Concern That Failure of Disarmament Will Affect the Far East</p>
<p>Advocates Collective System to Guarantee Security</p>
<p>Simon Leaves Geneva to Return to London</p>
<p>(Geneva) At the General Committee meeting of the Disarmament Conference this afternoon, Chairman Henderson lamented the seriousness of the current situation and urged all delegates to continue negotiations and establish an arms convention. He then proposed that the General Committee meeting be postponed to next Tuesday, so that the delegates could reflect on the very critical situation that has arisen and so that the British and French delegates could resolve their differences and reach a compromise. Before the General Committee meeting began, the atmosphere in the lounge was tense. Delegates gathered in groups of three or five, discussing the future of the Disarmament Conference, speaking freely and without concealment. Everyone felt that the Disarmament Conference had reached a critical juncture. At 3:45 PM, Henderson solemnly ascended the podium and announced the opening of the meeting, fifteen minutes later than scheduled. After Henderson urged the delegates to save the Disarmament Conference with solemn words, he read out the resolution passed by the League of Nations Cooperation Committee at Folkestone, which emphatically stated that if the Disarmament Conference failed, the situation would be unimaginably dangerous. The delegates were surprised to learn that British Foreign Secretary Simon had purchased a night train ticket and was preparing to return to London immediately. People held different views on this matter, some saying that Simon's return was to consult with the cabinet, while others said that Simon felt that staying in Geneva for a long time would not help the overall situation, so he returned to London. (Reuters dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) At the meeting of the Disarmament General Committee, Chairman Henderson said in his speech that the current situation of the Disarmament Conference is extremely serious, more so than at any time. He is very anxious. The current situation cannot be resolved merely by expressing opinions. Therefore, he proposed to postpone the meeting to next Tuesday and hold a main body meeting on Monday, so that the delegates would have ample opportunity to consider the matter at the end of this week. By then, the delegates may be able to find a way to proceed. Everyone wants complete success, without a doubt, but a concession must be obtained and put into practice.</p>
<h3>Poland Rejects Russian Proposal for Security Organization, Sides Against France</h3>
<p>Polish Foreign Minister Beck criticized the plan for a permanent body proposed by Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov, pointing out that it conflicts with the authority of the League of Nations. Apart from that, he is willing to support any proposal that can solve this problem.</p>
<h3>Mr. Gu Weijun's Speech: Security and Disarmament Are Inseparable</h3>
<p>Chinese Envoy to France, Dr. Gu Weijun, took the floor and said that since the opening of the Disarmament Conference, the Chinese delegation has focused on finding a satisfactory solution to the security issue, as this issue is the real cause of various difficulties. Dr. Gu went on to say that we have expressed more than once the opinion that if the existing collective action system is not implemented, the disarmament cause will be in danger. If the international treaty stipulating the peaceful resolution of international disputes and prohibiting the use of force as a policy tool is despised and undermined without being prevented by collective action, then no one will be willing to engage in disarmament rashly. Gentlemen, you still remember that when the Disarmament Conference had just opened its doors and started working, an undeclared war broke out in the Far East. One country, with its superior army, invaded another country, completely disregarding the solemn obligations under international treaties. This international treaty is regarded by the world as the most important support for peace. However, for two and a half years, what the aggressor has gained remains with the aggressor, and not a single person has helped the victim. Even the common obligations under the League of Nations Covenant are ineffective. This undeniable fact and lesson cannot be forgotten by farsighted politicians. In short, the current collective peace system has not achieved sufficient security at all. Security is a fundamental issue and cannot be separated from the disarmament issue. If there is a general agreement to formulate an effective security system based on collective guarantees and ensure its effective implementation, then the disputes over other aspects of the disarmament issue will be easily resolved. He expressed his agreement with the British Foreign Secretary Simon's statement that the security issue is a matter of degree, not a matter of principle. If armaments cannot be completely abolished, then merely reducing armaments without supplementing them with a security system based on collective guarantees and compulsory implementation will ultimately fail to secure peace.

<p>(Geneva) The talks and mediation of third parties have not yet melted the differences between Britain and France. French Foreign Minister Barthou received a telegram from French Prime Minister Doumergue, praising his amazing speech on Wednesday, so the French side's attitude became more and more firm. The general feeling is that if there is no unexpected development, the only method that can be adopted when the Disarmament General Committee meets at 3:30 this afternoon is to announce an adjournment, pending an understanding between the major powers. Without this understanding, negotiations will never succeed. However, the representatives of small countries may make a final effort to advocate the discussion of the three points proposed by British Foreign Secretary Simon, namely: 1) Limiting chemical warfare; 2) Publicizing the budget; 3) Establishing a permanent disarmament committee. France has always opposed the publicity of the budget, unless the publicity of the budget and the restriction of the budget are carried out at the same time. In any case, it is recognized that this method is insignificant compared to the original grand plan of the Disarmament Conference. (Reuters dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The survival of the Disarmament Conference will be decided tomorrow. Although the general opinion is that the postponement of the Disarmament Conference is the only solution, the current atmosphere is extremely uneasy. Chairman Henderson told a Reuters reporter tonight that in the past two and a half years, the situation has been more serious than it is today. If it does not change quickly, there is no hope for the situation. The representatives are extremely unwilling to clearly state their positions. The discussion may end at the General Committee meeting tomorrow. The representatives of Spain and Sweden are now working hard to reconcile the attitudes of Britain and France, and will re-submit the Swedish memorandum of April 14, which has been approved by the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Spain, and Switzerland, with slight revisions. The memorandum advocates: 1) Immediately find a way to prevent the existing situation from deteriorating; 2) Unconditionally prohibit aerial bombardment; 3) Truly reduce armaments; 4) Give adequate but practical realization to the principle of equal rights. (Reuters dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Since British Foreign Secretary Simon and French Foreign Minister Barthou made their speeches and argued with each other yesterday, the League of Nations has been in chaos. Seeing this, the Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, Henderson, specially devised a way to postpone the meeting to Friday so that the delegations of various countries would have more time to consider the opportunity. Now, all parties in Geneva feel that the differences between Britain and France have deepened to the point of being irreconcilable, and the death of the Disarmament Conference is imminent. However, in order to prevent the interruption of the conference discussion, some people have suggested to the Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov to submit a proposal to the Disarmament Conference, which contains the main points of his speech the other day. This may be the life-saving soup of the Disarmament Conference, which is not necessarily true. Furthermore, British Foreign Secretary Simon will submit a proposal for the organization of a permanent disarmament conference at the next meeting, which may also be put to discussion. Furthermore, the differences between the matters proposed by Simon and Litvinov are also very obvious, that is, the main point advocated by Litvinov is "security," while Simon's advocacy is still to disarm.

<h3>Only Seeking to End the Meeting, Britain Has No Extravagant Hopes; It Is Okay to Narrow the Scope and Conclude a Convention; Organize Security by the Concentric Circle Method</h3>
<p>(London) The majority party in Parliament openly hopes that the disarmament issue can be resolved, but the diplomatic community believes that ending the Disarmament Conference is not appropriate at least at the moment, so it continues to hope that a disarmament convention can be concluded within the scope of the following four points: 1) Limiting the air force; 2) Prohibiting chemical and germ warfare; 3) Supervising armaments; 4) Organizing security by the "concentric circle" method. However, Britain's participation in the organization is limited to mutual consultation (according to concentric circles, or the so-called regional treaties concluded by various countries to guarantee security, each region is a concentric circle). In order to deal with the Labor Party, which is the opposition party, the government party clearly wants to cover up the failure of disarmament, and it is really necessary to cover it up. Therefore, even Litvinov's claim is to be reviewed and the part that can be considered by the United Kingdom is taken. Within a certain range, the Italian plan is also intended to be adopted, as long as France agrees. However, British people do not have extravagant hopes for the success of disarmament. Therefore, even if the scope is very small, if international consensus can be obtained, the United Kingdom will be happy to accept it, as if relieved of a heavy burden, so as to prove that the efforts to prevent war are not completely ineffective. (Havas dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<p>(London) Although the British side has not responded to the Soviet Union's Foreign Minister Litvinov's proposal to the Disarmament General Committee, most British public opinion hopes that the Disarmament Conference will prolong its life due to Litvinov's proposed European security pact. This is difficult to deny. For example, the Liberal Party's organ newspaper "Manchester Guardian" has this attitude. The newspaper said that Litvinov only made a verbal proposal and has not yet submitted a specific draft resolution, but some small countries see that the Disarmament Conference has not achieved anything so far, so it is better to have this resolution than nothing, and it may be submitted as soon as possible. In any case, if any disarmament convention seeks to have a little value, then the security issue must not be ignored. We should participate in the solution of the security issue, but we cannot prove that the United Kingdom has clearly understood the method of solving the security issue. If small countries and the Soviet Union do propose a formal proposal for a European security pact, then in any case, before the Disarmament Conference admits defeat, it is necessary to review this proposal.

<h3>Differences Between British and French Opinions Will Not Affect Diplomatic Relations: A Glimpse of Public Opinion in London and Paris</h3>
<p>(London) British newspapers seem to have no more hope for the Disarmament Conference to achieve concrete results. What they publish is mostly pessimistic news reported by Geneva interviewers. Some interviewers believe that the disarmament issue has completely stalled, some regard the Disarmament Conference as being in a dangerous period, and some believe that the form of negotiations seems to have inclined to the postponement of the meeting. The Times said, "Barthou's speech yesterday revealed the difference between British and French opinions, which is not without benefit to make people understand the truth. Although British and French opinions do not agree, the national relations between each other will not be chilled because of this." The New Chronicle said, "The most rational way at the moment is to end the Disarmament Conference in the short term and reconvene it when the situation is favorable." (Havas dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<p>(Paris) The General Committee of the Disarmament Conference was suspended for a day yesterday, and the newspapers here took the opportunity to comment on the reactions of Simon and Barthou's speeches, and regarded Simon's words as seeking the end of the Disarmament Conference, while Barthou's words wanted to make the meeting reappear. The Morning Post said that when Simon set off for Geneva, McDonald had ordered him to find a way to end the work of the Disarmament Conference at the appropriate time, because he wanted to use this method to make British public opinion help the British government to expand its air force. According to the Morning Post, Barthou's speech gave the English a chance to take advantage of it. In addition, the newspapers since yesterday have believed that Barthou's speech was frank and bright, and has no adverse effect on British-French relations. (Havas dispatch on the 1st)</p>

<h3>French Army and Air Force Hold Large-Scale Exercise: To Be Held in Salon Soon; Border Defense Expenses Exceed Budget; Minister of Land, Petain, Explains</h3>
<p>(Paris) The French military exercise will be held between Salon and Melly soon. The participants in the exercise are large new-style divisions, and private airplanes will also join at the request of the Department of Aviation, so that these airplanes can be used for delivery and liaison in future operations. (National Telegram on the 1st)</p>
<p>(Paris) Minister of Land Petain attended the Finance Committee of the House of Representatives today and made an explanation on the organization of border defense works. The estimated amount of funding for this project has slightly exceeded, and General Petain explained that there are three reasons: 1) The new project is huge, and the estimates of technicians are slightly wrong; 2) Difficulties are encountered from time to time when drilling the strata; 3) The construction of defense works must be completed before the end of 1934, and the number of recruits begins to decrease (according to the reduction of births of French people during the European War from 1914 to 1918, the number of recruits will be greatly reduced from 1935 to 1939). Petain said that the defense equipment should be excellent, so that the sacrifice of lives can be reduced in the event of war. The Socialist Party members raised some objections, and Petain answered them one by one, and said that the members understood the situation of German military equipment, and if they were also the same as him, they would definitely vote for the defense works expenditure without hesitation. If the members are willing to obtain information about German military equipment, he is willing to supply it. The committee immediately resolved to approve General Petain's views.

<h3>Ratio of French and German Military Budgets Is Seven to Eight: Who Is More Threatening Is Very Obvious; German Diplomatic Review Publishes an Article</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The German Diplomatic Review published an article today, refuting French Foreign Minister Barthou's speech, because Barthou had discussed the recent increase in Germany's military budget, saying that it was ironclad proof of Germany's rearmament. The German Diplomatic Review then put forward the topic, "Which country is France being harmed by?" The newspaper replied, "If Germany increases its equipment for self-defense, and France cites it as harm to itself, then Germany's budget is only 800 million marks, and France's military budget reaches a huge amount of 2.7 billion. Then it is very obvious which country is harming which country. Is a military budget of 800 million marks sufficient reason for France to increase its armaments to a huge amount of 3 billion francs, as requested by the French government and agreed to by the parliament? Furthermore, is Germany's passive aviation construction and civil aviation business a suitable reason for the French government to increase its military aviation equipment from 150 million to 500 million marks? Who is the aerial harmer, Germany, which has no air force equipment, or France, which has the world's strongest air force?" (National Telegram on the 30th)</p>
<h3>Turkey's New Budget Greatly Increases National Defense Expenses: Actively Expanding Air Force Strength; Implementing New Taxes to Balance Revenue and Expenditure</h3>
<p>Istanbul: The Turkish Parliament today approved a budget of 30 million pounds, balanced in revenue and expenditure. The next fiscal year will begin tomorrow. The budget stipulates that 10 million pounds will be used for national defense expenses, including the expenses of the navy, army, air force, gendarmerie and other defense projects, which has greatly increased compared to last year's figures. According to official claims, due to the turbulent European affairs and Turkey's urgent need for security, it has to increase national defense expenses. The strength of the Turkish Air Force will be greatly increased. Many new aircraft will be ordered, and many new airfields will be built, and foreign instructors will be hired. It is expected that a large number of aircraft will be ordered from the United States. New taxes will be implemented from tomorrow. All items such as flour, sugar, coffee, biscuits, and cigarettes will be taxed to compensate for the huge expenditure. (Reuters dispatch on the 30th)</p>

<h3>League of Nations Discusses Chaco Dispute: Resolution to Handle It in Accordance with Article Fifteen of the Covenant; Arms Embargo Only Luxembourg Has Not Replied</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Council of the League of Nations decided today to handle the dispute between Paraguay and Bolivia over the Chaco in accordance with Article Fifteen of the League Covenant at the request of the Bolivian government. The Council then held a secret meeting and expressed satisfaction with the progress of the arms embargo. Only Luxembourg has not replied. Although Germany has not formally replied, it has indicated that it is willing to abide by any resolution of the Council on this matter. According to Article Fifteen of the Covenant, the dispute will be submitted to the Council, and the Council will try its best to resolve it. Otherwise, the Council will publish the facts of the dispute and its recommendations, which it considers fair and appropriate. Now Paraguay has agreed to submit this dispute to the Council, so the Chaco War, which has been going on for a long time, may be resolved peacefully. (Reuters dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) At today's special meeting of the League of Nations Council, the Chaco war was discussed. The Bolivian representative criticized Paraguay's "victory and forgetfulness." The Bolivian representative declared that Paraguay has recently purchased a large number of arms, and the arms embargo is actually beneficial to Paraguay, so Bolivia must reject it. Moreover, Paraguay can navigate unimpeded, while Bolivia has been surrounded. (National Telegram on the 30th)</p>
<p>La Paz: The Bolivian government has now ordered the men in the country born in 1915 and 1916 to enter the camp for service from today. The seriousness of the situation is evident. Although the League of Nations has worked hard to mediate, the Paraguayan-Bolivian War has lasted for months, but the belligerent countries have not had the intention of ceasing war and making peace. The League of Nations has not implemented the ban on the supply of arms to these two countries. The Bolivian government's conscription of new soldiers today is probably the result of the Paraguayan army defeating the Bolivian army's Third Division. (Reuters dispatch on the 30th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations invited 31 countries to take unified action in order to block the supply of military equipment to Bolivia and Paraguay. Most countries have accepted this proposal. Only Luxembourg has not replied to the League of Nations. The League of Nations believes that this has little impact. Germany has not formally replied, but the representative of the Berlin government has unofficially indicated that it has accepted this proposal. (National)</p>

<p>A Grand Spectacle of Roosevelt's Grand Review of the American Navy and Air Force</p>
<h3>Report on the Expected Withdrawal of the Manila Fleet and Arrest of Japanese Espionage</h3>
<p>(London) The Morning Post's diplomatic correspondent reported news that the United States intends to withdraw its fleet stationed in Manila. It is said that according to the Philippine Independence Act, the United States can maintain a naval base in the Philippine Islands. The reason for this move, it is understood, is strategic. Because the fleet is too weak, it cannot withstand possible enemy attacks before reinforcements arrive. The move by the United States to maintain a naval base in Manila may make it easier to establish a US-Japan treaty, but what will happen to Hong Kong, Singapore, etc.? There is no answer here yet. Furthermore, Britain and Japan may also be able to conclude a treaty regarding these places. (1st, Reuters)</p>
<p>(New York) The largest naval assembly and maneuver in American history is now coming to an end. This morning, ninety-six warships sailed back from the sea and up the Hudson River, passing the cruiser Indianapolis, aboard which President Roosevelt was sailing. A grand review will be held by President Roosevelt, the Commander-in-Chief, this afternoon. The US Navy began its third annual test of US naval power efficiency on May 5th. The voyage was six thousand miles, and the maneuver location was in the Caribbean Sea, starting from the Panama Canal to the Virgin Islands. Two weeks after the maneuver, the warships went to Guantanamo Bay and then to New York to participate in the grand review. The feature of this year's exercise was the defense of the Panama Canal. All actions were as if in wartime. News from the Panama Canal was strictly checked. When the fleet passed through the canal, many merchant ships were not allowed to enter or exit, which lasted about twenty-four hours. (31st, Reuters)</p>
<p>(New York) President Roosevelt, aboard the flagship Indianapolis, reviewed the American fleet advancing up the Hudson River today. Naval aircraft soared over the entrance to New York Harbor. The fleet proceeded like a long snake, led by huge battleships, followed by agile destroyers, and submarines bringing up the rear. It was a rare spectacle of sea and air power not seen in peacetime. Millions of spectators were on the riverbanks and yachts. The USS Pennsylvania led the line, firing a 21-gun salute as it passed the President's flagship. Sailors and officers on board were in full dress uniform, saluting with their rifles. Each ship was freshly painted, spotless, and gleaming under the morning sun, like jewels. Fighter planes from the aircraft carriers took off one by one, performing various flying techniques, first flying in formation, then demonstrating bombing, smoke screens, and other wartime maneuvers. There was heavy fog on the Hudson River at first, which delayed the start of the review slightly, but the fog soon cleared, and the sun shone again. After passing the flagship, the fleet entered New York Bay and anchored. Officers and sailors were free to go ashore. Accompanying the President on the flagship were the Chief of Naval Operations, Standley, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Henry Roosevelt, and news reporters aboard the heavy cruiser USS Louisville. (31st, National Telegram)</p>
<p>(New York) Forty thousand sailors participating in President Roosevelt's naval review arrived here last night. Residents were excited and came out to welcome them. When the sailors landed, the piers were full of their sweethearts, families, and onlookers. President Roosevelt's face was slightly tanned by the sun. When he disembarked, he had a beaming smile. The cheers of the crowd were deafening. The President then departed for Groton, Massachusetts. Although there was fog at the beginning of the review, it soon cleared, and the military appearance was extremely impressive. Crowds gathered on the tops of tall buildings and the decks of ships, watching from afar. The whole city was in a naval mood that day, and many shops displayed women's sailor suits, etc. (1st, Havas)</p>
<p>(New York) Two Japanese men were arrested today for attempting to obtain secret information about the US Navy. The matter is currently under investigation. It is said that the two first tried to lure a retired sailor named Salowski with alcohol, and then inquired about the activities of the US fleet, especially the maneuvers in the Panama area and the Caribbean Sea. The two were later released on bail of $250. (31st, National News Agency)</p>
<h3>Rumor of Assassination Attempt Against Roosevelt</h3>
<p>(New York) Rumors spread that someone was plotting to throw a bomb at President Roosevelt's special train, so the police authorities have taken special precautions. A special guard of twenty-five men accompanied the President's special train for protection, and another seventy guards, fully armed, were stationed around the station. Undercover agents were also deployed everywhere. When the special train arrived, no one without a pass was allowed into the station. There are no leads on the plotters, but since Roosevelt was elected President, there have been several attempts to harm him, so this rumor must be given special attention.

<h3>Sino-Italian Friendship: Chinese Envoy Hosts Mussolini; Chinese Inspection Delegation Assembles in Rome</h3>
<p>(Rome) Italian Prime Minister Mussolini was hosted at the Chinese Embassy for the first time tonight. The Prime Minister wore the First Class Precious Jade Medal awarded by the Chinese government in March of this year. The Chinese Envoy and his staff were deeply impressed by Mussolini's respect for etiquette. During the dinner, Liu Wendao said in his speech, "We Chinese all consider Your Excellency to be the greatest figure in centuries." Mussolini then gave a reply, praising China's two thousand years of culture. The inspection delegation led by Yu Feipeng, Vice Minister of Communications, will arrive here on Sunday. Italian circles are paying close attention. Yu's trip is to inspect the Italian railway, postal, and wireless telegraph systems. Xu Tingyao and others are also traveling with him. In addition, the Chinese Kuomintang delegation inspecting the Fascist system has also arrived here. All of this can be regarded as evidence of the deep friendship between China and Italy. The delegation will go to Germany within days to inspect the National Socialist Party's system. (1st, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Italy Does Not Consider Japan's Declaration of Blockading China to Be Concluded; Still Skeptical of Hirota's Assurances</h3>
<p>(Rome) Today, it was expressed here that Italy does not consider Japan's declaration of blockading China to be concluded. Italian newspapers today published in their conspicuously suggested articles that the Italian Ambassador to Japan, Auriti, is now questioning the Japanese government, asking it to explain the statement made by the Foreign Ministry spokesman on April 17th. Italy has taken note of Foreign Minister Hirota's assurance that Japan is determined to respect existing treaties, but Italy must still make it clear that a policy of hegemony over China is ultimately dangerous. Italy's attitude towards China is based on humanitarianism and believes that this policy is beneficial to China and world peace. The United Kingdom and the United States responded to Japan's declaration the earliest, but Italy has not yet made an official statement. (1st, National Telegram)</p>

<h3>Opium Advisory Committee Discusses the Issue of Licenses in Manchukuo; Uses Lack of Qualification for Judgment as an Excuse; Japanese Representative Yokoyama Speaks Nonsense; Hu Shih-Tze Refutes with Strong Words</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Opium Advisory Committee held a closed meeting today to discuss the issue of opium import licenses in "Manchukuo." To avoid political disputes, most committee members advocated maintaining the current system, with consuls still issuing licenses. British representative Danafin insisted that these licenses did not have the same guarantees as import licenses. The committee then resolved that it was not qualified to judge who should issue import licenses. This matter should be mentioned in the report to the League of Nations Council. Japanese representative Yokoyama claimed that the opium situation in "Manchukuo" was left over from previous rulers, but he recently received a letter from a Japanese friend informing him that "Manchukuo" will continue to improve. Chinese representative Hu Shih-Tze then asked Yokoyama who his friend was, as Yokoyama had previously said that Japan had nothing to do with "Manchukuo." Yokoyama replied that they were consultants. Hu retorted that if they could handle opium issues, their status must be higher than consultants. The committee has adopted the report of the seizure subcommittee. The US representative to the Opium Conference, Fowler, also serves as the reporter for the seizure of secret drug manufacturing in China. It is said that most of the drugs seized were on ships sailing from Dalian to China. According to seizures in China and Hong Kong, China currently has a large number of secret manufacturing of morphine and heroin, mostly from Sichuan, Shanghai, and Peiping, followed by Shenyang and Harbin. The committee believes that the scope of secret drug manufacturing has expanded, which is not only a great harm to China but will also affect other parts of the world. (31st, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Saar Plebiscite Issue; Three-Person Committee Drafts Plan; Stolen Documents Found in River</h3>
<p>(Geneva) After several hours of discussion late last night, the representatives of France, Germany, and Italy finally drafted a plan for the Saar region's self-determination issue.

They were immediately salvaged, and what was inside was part of the documents stolen from the Education Bureau of the French state-owned coal mine area on the evening of the 22nd of this month. The Saar region authorities were immediately notified to conduct an investigation. The French authorities on the opposite bank assisted in the search and found four packages in the French part of the Saar River. It is estimated that they were thrown into the water not long ago. According to general speculation, all the stolen documents must be in the packages. (31st, Havas)</p>
<h3>US Senate Approves New Treaty with Cuba</h3>

However, this new treaty still allows the United States to interfere in Cuban affairs to protect the lives and property of American citizens and allows the United States to militarily occupy Cuba and all measures taken during the time until the Cuban Republic is established to be perpetuated forever. The stipulation that the US Navy may establish a base in Guantanamo also remains in effect. This new treaty will take effect after both parties sign it. (31st, Reuters)</p>
<h3>US House Passes Silver Bill; All Amendments Rejected; No Problem Expected in the Senate</h3>
<p>(Washington) The House of Representatives today passed the Silver Bill by a large majority of 266 votes to 77. Before the bill was passed, the House rejected a motion to refer the bill to a committee to draft an amendment to issue silver certificates to purchase silver by a vote of 268 to 70. The bill was passed without any amendments. The government leaders were able to pass the bill without violating the President's wishes, and the government-appointed members were also able to reject all amendments proposed by the opposition party. The bill has now been sent to the Senate and will be debated soon. There will be some resistance to this bill in the Senate, but it will not have any significant impact. When the House passed the Silver Bill, the New York Merchants Association was also discussing the bill in New York and resolved to oppose it. (31st, National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) The House of Representatives today passed the silver bill proposed by the silver faction members of the Senate by a vote of 263 to 77. This bill (1) stipulates increasing the amount of silver held by the United States and allows the President to receive silver currency from the public; (2) authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase silver at home and abroad in the market at prices, times, and conditions that he deems appropriate and most beneficial to the public. The purchase of silver domestically is limited to 50 cents per ounce of all silver on May 1st. The Secretary of the Treasury may also sell silver when the market price of silver exceeds the value of the currency, or when the amount of currency held exceeds the ratio of 75 gold to 25 silver; (3) the Secretary of the Treasury may issue silver certificates, the face value of which shall not be less than the cost of the silver purchased. In addition, the Secretary of the Treasury will regulate, investigate, and prohibit the purchase, import, and transportation of silver, and impose a fine of $10,000 or ten years in prison on all violators. The Secretary of the Treasury has the power to issue regulations that he deems appropriate to implement the purpose of this bill. At today's meeting, Democratic silver faction members opposed this bill, pointing out that this bill is equivalent to silver bricks and will prolong the depression for ten years. Republican members criticized this bill, believing that it lacks stability in currency. Democratic supporters of this bill said that the government's gold policy needs to be supplemented to increase prices and foreign trade. (31st, Reuters)</p>
<h3>US Drought and Labor Strikes</h3>
<p>(New York) Thirty-five states in the United States, from the Rocky Mountains to New England, are in a serious situation due to a prolonged drought. The rainfall in Iowa, Nebraska, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio is particularly low, the lowest ever recorded. Even if these five states receive heavy rain within half a month, the harvest will only be half of normal. There are ten other states with similar situations. The temperature is extremely high in several places, exacerbating the disaster. The temperature in the shade in Aberdeen, South Dakota, reached 100 degrees Fahrenheit today, but the temperature in Minneapolis, Minnesota, was even higher, reaching 106 degrees. Iowa City also reached 105 degrees, and Chicago reached 102 degrees. Crops and livestock in the western states are showing signs of damage, and the International Wheat Agreement is also uncertain, so the government's restriction policy may change. Farmers in the disaster area are no longer bound by the restriction policy. Undersecretary of Agriculture Tugwell stated that the government may adopt a policy of expanding agricultural production rather than restricting it after considering the disaster. The increase in temperature and the fear of crop failure caused the price of wheat futures on the Chicago Board of Trade to soar today, reaching about one US dollar per bushel, the highest price since last fall. The official weather bureau predicts that the drought is unlikely to ease in the short term. Congress will inevitably face the issue of appropriating funds for disaster relief. As for how much money is needed, it is not yet possible to estimate. According to news today, the temperature in the shade in Elwood, Iowa, reached 111 degrees. The wheat that has not been destroyed is maturing very quickly. Farmers in Oklahoma and Kansas are currently engaged in harvesting. According to statisticians' estimates, one-third of the wheat in Iowa has not germinated in the soil. The central and state governments have now announced relief plans. According to Canadian telecommunications, several places in Canada are also suffering from drought, but the situation is gradually improving, and the heatwave has subsided. However, this year's wheat harvest is feared to be the smallest in sixteen years. (1st, Reuters)</p>

<h3>Sakano's Imprudent Remarks Lead to Dismissal, Uganda's Cabinet Formation Hope Dashed</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Amidst reports that the army and navy were absolutely opposed to Governor-General Ugaki forming a cabinet, Military Affairs Promotion Department Committee Chairman Sakano issued a statement yesterday endorsing Governor-General Ugaki of Korea's formation of a cabinet, causing considerable turmoil in political circles. At the same time, the navy, due to the passing of elder statesman Admiral Togo, felt an even greater need for unity. If that statement was issued in a way that seemed to represent the navy, there would be great regret over military control. People also regard the admiral's statement as naval interference in politics, and this has been highlighted. The anti-Ugaki faction within the army, seeing this situation, quickly gathered last night to oppose attacks on the navy. The navy also regarded the situation as serious and dismissed Committee Chairman Sakano, who had only been in office for three weeks. Therefore, the atmosphere aroused by the statement within the navy can be calmed down. Moreover, Major General Sakano and Governor-General Ugaki are both from Okayama, which made his position even more unfavorable. On the other hand, Governor-General Ugaki's entry into the political world will become even more difficult as a result of this. (1st, Electric News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Navy Military Affairs Promotion Department Committee Chairman Major General Sakano's statement yesterday that "the military does not oppose the emergence of the Ugaki cabinet" was made in violation of the intentions of the navy's top brass. As a result, Major General Sakano incurred the wrath of the top brass and was dismissed from his position as Committee Chairman of the Military Affairs Promotion Department. (1st, Electric News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the navy's statement that it would not obstruct the emergence of the Ugaki cabinet, the Seiyukai (political party) observes the following: The navy's statement indicates that it does not oppose the Ugaki cabinet, and at the same time, it will not take any action against the emergence of a party cabinet. This move may yield extremely good results for the emergence of a party cabinet that the majority of the people yearn for. (1st, Electric News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The House of Peers' view on the Sakano issue is as follows: The content of Major General Sakano's statement this time is the same as the previous Amahisa statement, with little accurate understanding of the situation within the department. Therefore, its publication without the understanding of the superior, from the point of view of maintaining military discipline, can be said to be inattentive. From this, it can be seen that the atmosphere within the navy opposing Ugaki's appointment to the cabinet is relatively strong. (1st, Electric News Agency)</p>

<h3>The Japanese Side Obstructs the Opening of the Hebei Province Special Police into the War Zone, Deliberately Making Things Difficult Regarding the Number of People and Types of Weapons. The Military Sub-Committee Sends a Telegram Calling for Lei Shourong to Return to Tianjin for Negotiations</h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The issue of the newly formed special police team of Hebei Province entering the war zone has been negotiated with Chai Shan, the military attaché of the Japanese Embassy in Beiping, for many days without any results. Yin Rugeng came to Tianjin yesterday to report this matter to Yu Xuezhong. In fact, the newly formed special police team and the security team are of a rotation nature, and there is no such thing as increasing the defense force. However, since the two matters of opening traffic and postal services in North China have not yet been realized, the Japanese side deliberately makes things difficult, and matters that are not problems become problems. In addition, the two items that the Japanese side considers to be too many people and the prohibition of machine guns from being carried into the war zone as heavy weapons are nothing more than excuses. Because the security teams of Zhou Yuying, Wei Yonghe, and Yang Yongshan, which are currently stationed in the war zone, also have more than 8,000 people and each carry machine guns. Even if the special police team does not go, the strength of the security team stationed in the war zone is also equal. It is not that after the special police team goes, our strength will increase by a certain amount. The Japanese side’s concerns are really superfluous. The provincial government currently does not take an active approach to this negotiation and intends to wait for the Military Sub-Committee to take charge. The intention of the Military Sub-Committee is that in the Tanggu Agreement, the number of special police teams in the war zone and the types of weapons that should be carried were not signed in the text of the agreement, but only orally agreed by the person in charge. As time has passed, the Japanese side deliberately refuses to recognize it because we have forgotten it. Therefore, the original person in charge must come north to contact the Japanese side in person. The original people in charge are Xiong Bin, Li Zeyi, and Lei Shourong. Xiong and Li are in Jiangxi and Fujian, respectively, and cannot go north in a short time. However, Lei Shourong has just returned to Nanjing from Japan, so a special telegram was sent to urge him to come north, intending to have Lei Shourong, based on the negotiation records of that day, resolve the matter with the Japanese side before Huang Fu returns to North China. If Lei cannot resolve it, he will wait for Huang Fu to return to assist in the handling. However, recently, Chai Shan, the military attaché of the Japanese Embassy, ​​told Yin Rugeng that this matter is of great importance and should be directly discussed with the Kwantung Army Department. Therefore, in addition to the above two methods, the Military Sub-Committee may send Lei Shourong and Yin Rugeng to Changchun to negotiate with the Kwantung Army Department of Japan as soon as possible. As for the newly formed special police team, they are still stationed in Cainancun and Cangxian in southern Tianjin, training every day, waiting for the order to be mobilized. However, according to observation, before the opening of traffic and postal services is realized, they will still not be able to enter the war zone for a while. The Japanese side has other deep intentions, which is to benefit the chaos in our war zone and disadvantage our order.</p>
<p>Although the strength of the new special police may not be greater than that of the security team currently stationed in the war zone, they are all stronger than half-year police training. Their knowledge of security law and police law is of course better than that of the security team. Recently, the war zone has become a hotbed of crime. The special police team will naturally have to crack down on it, and the backgrounds of all the hotbeds are Japanese and Korean vagrants, which will inevitably cause some inconvenience. Wu Minghao, the Magistrate of Jixian County, came to Tianjin yesterday to report to the provincial government on the withdrawal of the Japanese army from the county. He said that although the Japanese army has withdrawn, it has set up a military long-distance telephone between Malanyu and Jixian, and the news is still more sensitive than ours. There are countless drug agencies and gambling houses in the local area, all opened by Japanese and Korean people. Farmers are tempted and fall into depravity more and more every day. The fields are barren and left unattended, resulting in the complete bankruptcy of the rural economy. So far, the summer field tax has not yet been levied, and the county government has no way to rectify and relieve the situation. It is hoped that the special police team will go in as soon as possible to assist the local administrative agencies in persuasion so that the villages will not be completely destroyed. As evidenced by this statement, it is even more evident that the Japanese side’s obstruction of our special police’s entry into the war zone has other unspeakable motives. (May 29)</p>

<h3>France in the Tense European Situation (French Correspondence) Parliamentary Politics is Gradually Disintegrating, Doumergue's Cabinet Inclines to Dictatorship</h3>
<p>The European political situation is turbulent and unstable. The Disarmament Conference has no results. The main reason is that the confrontation between France and Germany has become increasingly intensified. At the same time, Italy wants to divide the hegemony of Central Europe. Therefore, French diplomacy has become even more tense. Not only must Germany not be allowed to use international diplomacy to restore its past strength, but also to share its strength to deal with Italy. However, within France, in terms of economy, it could only barely maintain from declining in the past. This year's economic situation has deteriorated very seriously. Leaving aside the general economic situation, just looking at the state treasury revenue, the amount of revenue shortfall this year is 700,000 francs. This shows the seriousness of France's financial problems, which is also a major problem in France's internal affairs.</p>
<p>The Paris riots on February 6th were the most significant event since the fall of Napoleon III and the establishment of the Third Republic in 1870. However, this riot was limited to the city of Paris. Similar movements did not occur simultaneously in other places, so the government still had means of suppression. The foundation of the Republic was not shaken by the disturbance of the royalists. As for the Stavisky-type fraud cases, they have occurred many times in France in the past century, so they are not considered a major problem. Of course, the royalists and communists can use this to stir up a movement, and many people in the public sympathize with them. However, to eliminate the evil forces of society, there is no need</p>
<p>to fundamentally overthrow the current system. We examine the violence used by the demonstrators. Their weapons are nothing more than knives and small</p>
<p>stones, which can also measure the public's feelings. Therefore, former President Doumergue, at the age of 72, took on the arduous task. As an old politician, he served as the prime minister in a time of crisis. First, he asked the leaders of all parties to "end all political disputes from now on." He also put forward hope conditions in the parliament, asking the House of Representatives to "indicate that such a foolish situation will not continue to occur for the sake of France's political stability." As a result, he gained the trust of the parliament. From mid-March to mid-May, the House of Representatives adjourned for two months, which means that the government was not interfered with by the parliament and actually achieved budget savings. Like changes in tariff rates, the dictatorial power of France has been gradually disintegrating in the past three years. There are too many parties, which cannot exert the role of the parliament and cannot make politics relatively stable. Whether Doumergue's cabinet's dictatorship will cause France's political situation to turn into fascist politics due to the stimulation of diplomatic tension is still a question.</p>
<p>The general public in France has very well-developed ideas of freedom and equality.</p>
<p>In the past, they have paid huge sacrifices for political freedom. As the leader of the left-wing party Herriot said, "We want to challenge the dictatorial political ideology that is sweeping the world without pretense, because dictatorial politics is enough to threaten political freedom internally and hinder international peace externally..." The parliamentary politics of France has indeed exposed its shortcomings. However, in politics, the President of France is only a head of state equal to a puppet. Although he has the power to dissolve the parliament in the constitution, since President MacMahon tried it once in 1877 and failed, there has been no second dissolution of the parliament. Therefore, no matter how the cabinet is formed, if it encounters a vote of no confidence in the parliament, it cannot dissolve the parliament and re-elect to ask the people's true intentions. There is only one way to resign from the cabinet. With this foundation, even if French politics has a dictatorial tendency, its nature is of a different type. What's more, Doumergue himself is different from Hitler and Mussolini, so Doumergue's dictatorship will not develop as unrestricted as in Italy and Germany.</p>
<p>In short, the current emergency cabinet in France has a strong dictatorial flavor. Its main purpose is to calm domestic unrest and maintain the status quo. As for the international aspect, she will do her best to maintain her existing position, even at a considerable cost, sacrificing past prejudices, in order to consolidate her international position, such as being friendly with the Soviet Union to suppress Germany and to restrict Italy. The general situation in the international community is largely returning to the diplomatic situation before 1914. The domestic trend is that the image of parliamentary politics is gradually fading in France. (April 26, Paris)</p>
<h3>Bizarre Phenomenon of Black Soil Under Japanese Rule</h3>
<p>(Opium and Gambling are Public, Brothels are Everywhere)</p>
<p>(Japanese Vagrants Roam Everywhere)</p>
<p>According to people from Heilongjiang Province, since the Dragon River Province was ruled by the Japanese, opium and gambling have been made public and brothels have sprung up everywhere. Generally, pseudo-government officials and dandies either go to opium dens to smoke and exhale, or go to brothels to indulge in wine and women to have fun. The Dragon River in broad daylight has been transformed into a world of opium and sex. If this continues, the compatriots in the Northeast will become more and more degenerate, and their spirits and bodies will become more and more fragile. I am afraid that there will never be any hope of restoring the homeland. This kind of deadly poison is worse than airplanes and cannons.</p>
<p>Officials of various agencies can record their accounts when they usually go to opium dens to smoke opium or stay in brothels with prostitutes. They do not need to pay in cash. At the end of each month, the persons in charge of the opium dens and brothels will settle the accounts, send them to the various agencies separately, and deduct the amount of opium money and brothel money owed by each official from the salaries of the various agencies. This kind of opium fee and prostitution fee is the largest monthly expense for officials of various agencies, and there are often those who do not have enough household expenses. As for those who open opium dens, most of them are Koreans, and those who open brothels are mostly Japanese. Observing their intentions, they want to use chronic poison to absorb the marrow of our nation, so that our people will become weak until they are destroyed. What is even more bizarre is that Japanese vagrants roam everywhere. They often ride horses directly into the classrooms of the Women's Normal School after being drunk, revealing all kinds of ugly states and uttering all kinds of irregular languages. Because of this, many female students have not dared to go to school for many days. All kinds of bizarre phenomena are everywhere. There are too many to write down. The taste of being a slave in a lost province makes people feel very sad. (Northeast News Agency)</p>
<h3>Mao Zedong Has Been Bombed to Death, The Internal Disintegration of the Red Bandits Has No Fighting Spirit, The Ring Leader Has Been Executed, The Remaining Bandits Are Even More Insufficient to Be Eliminated</h3>
<p>Nanchang Communication, Military News, when the 8th Column of the National Army was ordered to recover Jianning the previous time, the pseudo 135th Army Corps was entrenched in the north of Jianning City. The National Army first attacked and advanced against the 2nd Division of the pseudo-army stationed in Mazhai. They charged each other more than ten times. The bandits could not support it and all collapsed in the southwest direction of Jianning. The bandits abandoned and did not defend the Jianning city walls. According to the captured bandit soldiers, since the fifth encirclement and suppression by the National Army, the officers and soldiers of the bandit army have suffered heavy casualties, especially the lack of ammunition. Each gun has at most four or five rows, so they dare not linger at all in every battle. Once they have the opportunity, they will retreat. A few days ago, Mao Zedong was bombed to death by the National Army's plane in the rear of Ruijin. The bandit troops' replenishment of conscription, ammunition, food, and all daily necessities are extremely difficult. After Mao Zedong's death, the internal spirit was disintegrating and the bandit officers and soldiers had no fighting spirit. Therefore, in recent battles, officers and soldiers were unwilling to flee with them, hid in the mountains, and surrendered as soon as the National Army chased after them. Commander Zhou has reported to the higher-level agencies after taking the statement.</p>
<p>In addition, the division commander Li Mo'an telegraphed on the 26th saying that the division has been winning battles in bandit suppression recently. Recently, it has approached the vicinity of Shuinan, and the bunker line between Guangchang and Jianning has been effectively broken and the remaining bandits have been driven to the south of the line. The internal collapse of the bandits and the escape is extremely chaotic. According to the captured bandits, Mao Zedong has indeed been bombed to death. The red flag, red star, and red army newspapers have had no mention of Mao for days, I think the ring leader has been executed, and the remaining bandits are even more insufficient to be eliminated.

<h3>Fang Bandit Plans to Flee to Northern Jiangxi, Chen and Zhao's Troops Advance and Suppress</h3>
<p>Nanchang dispatch: Fang Zhimin's bandits have recently expanded the pseudo-independent regiments and guerrilla forces in the counties along the Xin River and Rao River basins. They are also building fortresses in the bandit areas to solidify their defense. Chen Tiaoyuan, Zhao Guantao, and other units have already advanced into the bandit areas along multiple routes. Tang Huiyuan has captured Zixi in Qianshan. Ruan Zhaochang's division has captured Heqiao. A certain independent brigade of Chen's troops has also successively recovered the bandit areas surrounding Dexing and Leping, rescuing many refugees. Liang Lizhu's division on the front of Hengfeng captured Hengcheng on the 23rd. All of Fang's pseudo-organizations retreated to Gewuyuan, the old lair in northern Hengfeng. The original bandit troops in Shangrao, Qianshan, and Hengfeng scattered and fled. The pseudo-independent 1st, 2nd, and 3rd columns, reorganized from the independent regiments of Guixi and Shangrao, fled to western Zhejiang and southern Anhui. The bandit troops in the middle and lower reaches of the Xin and Rao Rivers, around Guiwan, numbering over ten thousand, collapsed and fled from Wannian, Le'an, and Fuliang. Currently, in Wannian and Fuliang, scattered bandits are causing disturbances everywhere, rumors are rampant, and people are panicking. However, Chen Tiaoyuan is stationed in Wuyuan, a stone's throw from Fuliang and Leping. Fang's bandit's plan to follow the original route to disturb northern Jiangxi will likely fail. (May 27)</p>
<h3>Recovery of Feiyuan in Eastern Jiangxi; Bandit Attack on Tongbu Repelled</h3>
<p>Wuyuan dispatch: Regarding the military operations to suppress the Red bandits in eastern Jiangxi, in addition to the eastern route Zhao Guantao's troops, Liang's division, and Zhao's brigade recovering Hengfeng on May 25, military operations on the Jiangxi-Anhui border have also made continuous progress. According to military intelligence from Shangrao, Commander Tan of the 囗囗 division led the 339th and 341st regiments from Kuqiao on the morning of the 18th to attack Feiyuan. At noon, they encountered about 3,000 bandits, with over a thousand guns, who stubbornly resisted from the mountains. The national army bravely pursued and engaged fiercely. After sending troops to attack from the flanks, the bandits began to collapse and retreat to the high mountains north of Biaoxi. That evening, Feiyuan was recovered. Currently, they are reorganizing and building blockhouses. According to captured bandits, the bandits suffered about 400 casualties in this battle. The national army also suffered some casualties due to the uphill attack. Furthermore, at 4:00 AM on the 23rd, about 400 bandits, with about 300 guns, launched a fierce attack on the national army's blockhouses in Tongbu, Nanhe, Dexing. The two sides engaged in a fierce battle for 30 minutes, killing two bandits, wounding dozens, and capturing one wounded bandit, one rifle, and dozens of bullets. The bandits retreated to Dada, about 500 meters southwest of Tongbu, intending to stubbornly resist. After the national army launched a fierce attack with infantry, artillery, and machine guns, they completely collapsed and retreated. According to military news from Dexing, the pseudo-10th and 11th armies have merged to form the 10th Army. The 9th Army has been reorganized into the 11th Army. A part of Zhu De's bandits, having suffered losses in Lingnan, plans to flee to Gewuyuan, Beiguo, and Mengshi. The areas south of Wuyuan are adjacent to Jiangxi. Recently, due to the rapid advance of the national army, the remaining bandits are in a state of collapse and random flight. Therefore, small groups of stragglers are often found near the bandit areas. Currently, Zhang's brigade of the 囗囗 division has transferred Mei's battalion, stationed in Taibai, to Zhangmu and other areas to carry out suppression. The defense of Taibai has been taken over by Xu's battalion of the Independent 43rd Brigade. (May 29)</p>
<h3>Feng Yuxiang Returns to Tai'an, Visits Fan Zhongyan Ancestral Hall in Qingzhou, and Encourages Elementary School Students to Resist Japan</h3>
<p>Jinan dispatch: Feng Yuxiang has toured the famous scenic spots in eastern Shandong for over ten days. Then, as his enthusiasm for travel waned, he returned to Tai'an. On May 29, he arrived in Weixian from Yantai. On the morning of the 30th, he left Weixian by car. When passing through Qingzhou, he got off the car to pay respects to the portrait of Fan Zhongyan and gave a speech at the Tenth Middle School. At 6:10 PM, he arrived in Jinan. Important figures welcomed him at the station. After a short stay, the car switched from the Jiaoji Railway to the Jinpu Railway and immediately returned to Tai'an. The details of his return from Weifang to Jinan are as follows:</p>
<p>The special car sent by Han Fuqu to welcome Feng arrived in Weixian on the 29th. At 5:00 AM on the 30th, Feng's guards moved the luggage onto the car. County Magistrate Li Wenli, Police Chief Zhang En'yuan, Brigade Commander Li Xiangchen, and Regiment Commander Chuan Jianheng all waited at Feng's residence in the Shanghai Company to see him off. Zhang Yunmen, an old Christian friend from Guangwen Middle School in Dongguan, and Principal Cui Hongze also came to the station to see him off. Feng bought sesame cakes, fried dough sticks, and eggs, and let the people who were seeing him off feast on them. At 6:45 AM, Feng boarded the car. Amidst the cheers of the crowd, the car slowly departed. Weixian is very close to Qingzhou. At 8:00 AM, he arrived in Qingzhou. County Magistrate Yang Jiuwu, Police Chief Ma Dianbang, and Regiment Commander Hou Zhaolin led a company of pistol guards to provide security at the station. After the car stopped, Yang Jiuwu and Hou Zhaolin boarded the car to welcome him. Feng asked if there were any places to visit in Qingzhou. Yang replied that there was Fan Wenzheng's pavilion and his portrait west of the city, and Yunmen Mountain south of the city, which are also famous scenic spots in the county, and both are worth visiting. Because Feng admired Fan Wenzheng, he got out of the car to visit. He borrowed a long-distance bus from the automobile bureau. The station to Fan Gong Pavilion is about six or seven li. Feng arrived and paid respects to Fan Gong's statue. The core area is close to the Nanyang River, the water flows gurgling, and the scenery is beautiful. Feng drank tea and rested here for a while, then took a car into the city to rest at the Tenth Middle School. Principal Zhu Junsheng invited Feng to speak to the students. Feng declined but could not refuse, so he agreed. He then gathered more than a thousand students from the Tenth Middle School, the Tenth Middle School branch, the Fourth Normal School, and the Fourth Normal School Affiliated Elementary School to listen to the lecture at the Tenth Middle School. Before the students gathered, Feng wrote the words "Give Me Back My Rivers and Mountains" on a horizontal plaque and a couplet: "Rescuing the people has no day of rest; Revolution is the ultimate person." He instructed the school to hang them up as a motto. After a while, the students gathered in the main hall. Feng took the stage to speak, describing the seriousness of the national crisis and the situation of resisting Japan, in a tragic and impassioned manner.</p>
<p>Mr. Feng returned to the station. At the invitation of Lu Wenyuan, the section chief of the Jiaoji Railway Works Section, he went to the Works Section office to rest. Lu Wenyuan runs a private elementary school next to the station, which is dedicated to admitting the children of railway employees. There are hundreds of students, and the results are very good. He specially invited Mr. Feng to give a speech to the elementary school. Feng agreed readily. After resting for a while, he went to the school. The students were all around ten years old and welcomed him outside the school in a lively and orderly manner. Feng was very happy to see this. Then the students filed into the classroom, and nearby people also poured in to listen to the lecture, with no space inside or outside the room. After a brief introduction by the principal, Feng spoke, briefly saying: "Section Chief, teachers, little brothers and sisters, today I have the opportunity to speak to you in such a nice house. I think it is a very good scene and a very rare opportunity. I feel very happy and joyful. The principal just gave a brief introduction. I'm afraid you little brothers and sisters still don't know who I am. I am Feng Yuxiang. I studied in Mount Tai and came down the mountain to see all parts of Jiaodong. Wherever I go, I talk about resisting Japanese imperialism because Japan bullies our nation and invades our country. I am thoroughly opposed to the idea of non-resistance. Anyone who does not resist is our enemy. Do you all understand?" (The students answered loudly, "Yes!") "Just now I heard your principal say that you are all children of railway employees. I thought of a story to tell you. There was a person whose son graduated from higher elementary school. He wanted to ask him to work, so he took him to see a teacher to ask for advice. The teacher told him that if you want to succeed in your career, you only need two things: first, you must have the identity of a poor child; second, you must be determined to be the first person. The name of this teacher, I will tell you later. When he was young, his family was very poor. From the age of six or seven, he often heard his parents say, 'What are we going to eat tomorrow? What are we going to take to the pawnshop tomorrow?' He was immersed in this kind of life all day long. Over time, it made him determined to work hard in the future to avoid the pressure of life. When he was eleven years old, he began to work for others. The job was to mop the floor. When he was mopping the floor, he was determined to be the first person to mop the floor, mopping it white, bright, clean, and fast. No one nearby could compare to him. At the age of fourteen, he was promoted to deliver letters, and on the first day of delivering letters, he was determined to be the first person in delivering letters, the fastest and most reliable, never sending the wrong letter. Four months later, he memorized all the streets, alleys, doors, and even the number of people living in each door, and everyone's name clearly. When he received the letter, he could deliver it very quickly and accurately. As expected, he became the first person in delivering letters, and everyone praised him. At the age of seventeen, he was promoted to the telegraph bureau to learn to send telegrams. He worked hard day and night and became the first person among the telegraph students. Later, in every job he did, he was determined to be the first person until he made the steel industry and became the steel king. Who is this person? It is the American steel king Carnegie. Now that he is doing charity, he is determined to be the first person in the world in charity, using all his money to build nursing homes, orphanages, hospitals, and other causes. So someone asked him, and he said that to be successful in business, the first thing is to have the qualifications of a poor child, and the second is to be determined to be the first person. He said that rich people have reliance and bad habits and cannot do things, while poor children are like a clean white paper. I said just now that we are resisting Japan, because if we don't resist Japan, we will perish as a nation. I hope you will be determined to become the first person to resist Japanese imperialism, the first person to recover the lost land by force. Do you understand?" The students answered yes and repeated the main points of the speech to the students (the answers were very orderly.) "Since everyone understands, goodbye!"</p>
<p>At 1:48 PM, the train left Qingzhou. It stopped briefly at Zhangdian to load coal and water and then continued on its way. When it arrived in Zhoucun, Cao Fulin, the commander of the 29th Division, had already arrived in Jinan. The Chief of Staff Wang Shiqi led officers to welcome him at the station. After the car stopped, Wang boarded the car and talked with Feng for a few words. The car continued to travel west. At 6:10 PM, the car arrived in Jinan. Han Fuqu, Zhang Liansheng, Guo Zhigang, Sha Yuebo, Wen Chenglie, Liu Xizhong, Wang Kairu, and others all came to the station to welcome him. After the car stopped, Han and others boarded the car for a short conversation. Han asked why he didn't stay a few more days in Yantai, where the scenery is very beautiful. Feng said that there were many rumors in Yantai, and the news was not very accurate, so it was better to return to Mount Tai. Han asked him to stay in Jinan for a few days, but Feng refused, so as not to delay everyone's work. He also said that the eastern Shandong area is rich and prosperous, and its villages are even better than the county towns in western Shandong. He visited the Qi Gong Ancestral Hall in Penglai and the Beiwo City. He paid respects to the three memorial tablets of Ding Ruchang and others who died for the country in the Sino-Japanese War in Weihai. They are all anti-Japanese martyrs and are worthy of respect. Today, he passed through Qingzhou and visited the Fan Gong Ancestral Hall. Fan Gong's "worrying before the world and enjoying after the world" is even more admirable. He also visited the Three Sages Ancestral Hall. Furthermore, there are many products along the coast. Changshan Islands produces a lot of sea cucumbers. The Japanese use a big head, shaped like a tube, and enter the sea, and people can enter it to change the air and get the most sea cucumbers. Our fishermen still swim to collect sea cucumbers, so they get the least. Now, local fishermen have also purchased a dozen big heads and are imitating them. Each one costs 400 yuan. Then Han and others got out of the car. At 6:40 PM, Feng continued to leave Jinan by car. He can arrive in Tai'an around 9:00 PM and live in the original place. (May 31)</p>
<h3>Anhui Province Bans Gangs; Civil Affairs Department Orders County Magistrates to Handle Seriously</h3>
<p>Anqing dispatch: The Anhui Civil Affairs Department recently received a report from Qu Zhuxun, the county magistrate of Suxian, stating that he was ordered to investigate and ban the Guangdan Society and implement the joint responsibility system for Baojia chiefs. After investigation, although the names of the Anqing Gang, Qinghong Gang, Wuji Tao, and other gangs are different from the Guangdan Society, their ability to hinder local order and tranquility all make them possible dens for bandits. In order to strictly control mass organizations and prevent problems before they arise, it is planned to ban them uniformly by analogy. In addition to ordering each district and posting announcements to all Baojia chiefs to inform them, we have submitted a written report on the implementation of the order to ban the Guangdan Society and, by analogy, to ban the Anqing Gang, Qinghong Gang, Wuji Tao, and other circumstances. Please review and approve for implementation. The Civil Affairs Department immediately issued instructions: "Noted. There are many local gangs. The county magistrate, considering that the names of the Anqing Gang, Qinghong Gang, Wuji Tao, etc., all have the possibility of being dens for bandits, plans to ban them uniformly by analogy, which is correct. In addition to ordering each county to do the same, you must still earnestly investigate and ban them to curb the emergence of chaos." Furthermore, it ordered all counties that such wicked people are everywhere. If they are not prevented in advance and strictly prohibited, they will cause harm to the local area in the future, which is no small matter. It is urgently ordered that the county magistrate instruct the district Baojia chiefs and security teams under their jurisdiction to earnestly investigate and ban these illegal organizations without any concealment and report the implementation situation to the authorities for review at any time.

<h3>Water Police Team Captures Thieves</h3>
<p>Fan Zhicheng, the captain of the first team of the Provincial Water Police Team, received a report that Wang Jinqing's family robbery case in Fengjing Dongzhaikou, Songyi, was related to Li A'er. He immediately sent detectives to Daoyuan Town, Fengxian County, to arrest Li and escort him back to the Zhujing team headquarters for interrogation. At first, Li's confession was cunning, denying the surname Li, saying that his real name was Shen Lanchun, 38 years old, and he did not dare to break the law. After further questioning, he finally confessed truthfully and bowed his head without words. In addition to robbing Wang Jinqing's family in Dongzhai, Li A'er also robbed rice boats in Wuku Xinzhen and other cases repeatedly. The confession was recorded and handed over to Songjiang today, and sub-team leader Hu Tu was ordered to hand it over to the county government for handling.</p>

<h3>Vigorous Land Survey</h3>
<p>This county began preparing for land survey in July of the 21st year. The Land Bureau was established in October of the 22nd year, and it has been actively working to urge landowners to clear and survey the land, proceeding in stages. In only seven or eight months, more than forty townships have completed the survey, and more than ten townships are still surveying and have not yet been completed. To summarize the land survey of the entire county, one-third has already been completed. It is heard that the province will issue a new land survey method to thoroughly change it. The county party department specially presented a request to the Jiangsu Provincial Party Department yesterday, to forward it to the provincial government, ordering the Provincial Land Bureau not to change the method to facilitate the land survey so that it can be completed as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<h3>Garment Makers Oppose Forming a Trade Association and Go on Strike</h3>
<p>There are more than 40,000 tailors in Suzhou City, divided into four gangs: Changshu, Danyang, Zhenjiang, and Taixing. Among them, the Changshu and Danyang gangs account for the most. There are also many people from Wuxi and local areas. There is a Xuanyuan Guild Hall in Jiusheng Lane, which is the industry's public property. There are no other trade association organizations. Recently, someone named Chen and others applied to the county government for approval to establish a garment industry trade association. In addition to collecting nine jiao of foreign money per table per month, they also cracked down on light materials (it is customary for tailors to steal materials when making clothes, otherwise, the patrons must pay for wine. Light materials are to eliminate this bad habit), reduce wages, and make work at 60% of the market price (for example, a single-layer cheongsam originally cost two yuan and eight jiao, but it was reduced to one yuan and fifty-six jiao). The industry believes that this has a direct impact on their interests and hinders the lives of workers, and they expressed their opposition. They suddenly went on strike yesterday (the 1st) morning, and gathered more than 2,000 people to hold a meeting in the guild hall in Guanjian Jiusheng Lane. At the same time, a part of the workers, holding small flags, went to the shops that had not gone on strike to persuade them to join the strike, and nominated Qu Wenxiu, Gao Yongqing, Dai Ziqing, Li Nianxiu, Jin Afu, Chen Guisheng, and other thirty or forty people as representatives to petition the county party department. The county party department convened a meeting of all relevant parties to mediate, and persuaded them to resume work. If they need to join the trade association, they can first have the industry rush to create a list of members to join, and then have the members hold a general meeting to formulate industry rules. Then, the lawyer Xie Jusan, hired by the industry, stated that he was dissatisfied with the trade association and hoped that a majority of genuine industry members would form another trade association. As of 3:00 PM, there were still no results.</p>
<p>Long-distance telephone message: At 4:00 PM, about 3,000 to 4,000 workers (including shop owners and workers) gathered at the trade association on Jingde Road. Traffic from the west entrance of Guanjian Street to the Jingde Road area was completely blocked. At that time, the workers had a major conflict with the trade association. Several officers and soldiers suppressing the scene were injured, and the gate of the trade association was also knocked down. After hearing the news, Police Chief Shen Gaoqin immediately led the police to persuade them. They dispersed at 6:00 PM. After the incident, Chief Shen heard people say that ax gangs participated in the incident, and three workers were injured by axes. Therefore, he went to the trade association again to search and took Chen Yulin (not a garment shop owner), the initiator of the trade association, to the bureau for questioning. At 7:00 PM in the evening, another group of workers went to the trade association to negotiate, but did not cause any trouble. As of the time of the message, there were still more than a hundred people gathered in front of the trade association.</p>
<h3>The Verdict on the Appeal of the Defendants in the Xin Renhe Case</h3>
<p>The case of Sun Xingsheng, the owner of the Shanghai Xin Renhe ship, plotting to kill the peddler Ma Kou and five others, was appealed to the Suzhou High Court. Yesterday (the 1st), the Third Criminal Court conducted the trial. The original judgment on the crimes of Sun Xingsheng and others was revoked. Sun Xingsheng was sentenced to imprisonment for jointly plotting murder. Shen Xingqiao, Shen Chuanlang, Wang Mingda, and Huang Fusheng were each sentenced to 20 years imprisonment for conspiring to murder. Guo Xihou and Lu Ronggeng were each sentenced to 10 years imprisonment for conspiring to murder. Zhang Xiao Zhang and Feng Fusheng were each sentenced to 2 years imprisonment for conspiring to murder. Zhang Xiao Zhang was given a three-year reprieve. Feng Fusheng's public prosecution was not accepted. The attached civil lawsuit appeal ruling was sent to the Civil Court of this court for trial.</p>

<h3>County Government Strictly Prohibits Dragon Boats</h3>
<p>County Magistrate Xu Cixuan heard that some well-meaning people were preparing to race dragon boats on the abolished lunar Duanwu Festival. He issued a notice in advance strictly prohibiting it. If anyone dared to violate it, they would be severely punished. On the 28th, the Party-Government Talk Conference raised it again. After discussion by various agencies, it was resolved to thoroughly investigate and ban it. The day before yesterday, he also issued a notice to all township chiefs to strictly investigate and report, and the Public Security Bureau ordered the police in the urban and rural areas and the owners of various shipyards to make it clear and instruct them, and to submit a guarantee that they will never participate in or repair or build dragon boats in their respective jurisdictions, so that they cannot proceed.</p>
<h3>Provincial Approval for Maintaining Land Survey</h3>
<p>More than 20 agencies and groups, including the County Asset Management Office, previously jointly telegraphed the provincial government to request that the original plan be continued because the Provincial Land Bureau changed the land survey plan and disregarded the purpose of the landowners clearing the boundaries. The provincial government approved the following: "The telegram has been noted. This province previously received a telegram from Chiang Kai-shek, the chairman of the Military Affairs Committee, ordering that the initial work of the land survey must be completed before the end of March in the 24th year, so the original plan was slightly improved in order to quickly go to the matter and accomplish the great cause early. The land survey is one of the predetermined tasks. Although the implementation steps have been slightly improved, the purpose of urgently resolving land disputes and completing the consolidation work as soon as possible is the same as what the people of the county expect. As for the layer of people's own written reports, its original intention is to make people participate in the work so that the boundaries of the land are more accurate and the speed of business is further increased. The technical methods are still the responsibility of the land survey team, which is no different from the original method. As for the funding layer, it is still allocated according to the original plan, and there is no extra burden on the people. You must understand this purpose well and jointly promote this matter."</p>
<h3>District Division Dispute Resolved</h3>
<p>The county government was ordered to merge autonomous regions and organized a district division committee. The first resolution was to maintain the original eight districts and submitted it to the Civil Affairs Department for approval. The Civil Affairs Department ordered that there should be at least six districts. After discussion, it was resolved that the original seventh district would be merged into the second district, and the original six or seven districts and the Fangtai and other three townships in the first district would be merged into the sixth district. However, the Huangdu, Anting, and Fangtai towns in the district each strongly advocated setting up a district office in their respective towns, and the competition was fierce and could not be resolved. It was resolved that each town should submit a written reason for further review. On the 29th, a continued meeting was held. The parties still insisted on their own opinions. Finally, it was decided that the original sixth district would be merged into the 区 district, the original eighth district would be merged into the fourth district, and the Fangtai and other three townships would still be under the first district. The plan was to merge the entire county into five districts. The parties had no objection, and the dispute was resolved.</p>

<h3>Lingdian Port Sampan Men Cause Trouble</h3>
<p>The other day (27th), the Baofeng ship came from Shanghai to Haimen. When it arrived at Lingdian Port in the sixth district, many sampans leaned against the ship to compete for passengers. Among them, sampan man Wen Guangxian had a conflict with Chen A'er, a small worker on the ship, over a trivial matter. Chen was stabbed in the left neck by Wen with a bamboo pole, and blood flowed like a fountain. He fell to the ground in extreme pain. Then all the small workers were furious and planned to throw Wen into the river. At that time, Yuan Liuqing, the district chief of the sixth district, was on the ship and strongly dissuaded them, promising to investigate and deal with Wen according to the law after arriving ashore. The small workers obeyed and retreated. Later, Chen A'er was taken to Shanghai by the ship for treatment, but the injury was quite serious, and there was a risk to his life.</p>

<h3>Variable Readjustment of Cocoon Transaction Control</h3>
<p>In order to thoroughly reform sericulture, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction specially promulgated measures for the control of cocoon transactions. It was decided that these measures would be implemented during the current spring cocoon season. However, various cocoon merchants have found many conflicts between these measures and the original regulations for cocoon transactions, raising objections. After repeated meetings and separate submissions to the Yuan, the Ministry, and the Provincial Department, they requested that the measures be changed; otherwise, they vowed not to pay the three-yuan improvement fee. Simultaneously, the trade association continued to petition the sericulture model district. The director and deputy director of the model district, Yan Shenyu and Cai Jingde, also felt that the spring cocoon season was approaching rapidly and an appropriate solution should be sought promptly to avoid problems arising at the last minute. Yesterday, they drafted opinions and jointly went to the provincial capital to request instructions. These are excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The cocoon industry association's previous request to postpone the implementation of cocoon transaction control has not yet been approved by the Ministry and the Province. However, the spring cocoon season is imminent. If the government and merchants remain deadlocked, problems will inevitably arise. Therefore, three opinions are proposed: A. For cocoon processing units with four or fewer stoves and those that have not opened for weighing for two consecutive years, special consideration should be given to allow them to operate. B. For all cocoon processing units that open for weighing, they should still follow the established practice of registering with the association. The business owners who open for business should voluntarily waive the provision in Article 4 of the control measures regarding the distribution of profits to stove workers. However, the registration deposit should be specially exempted. C. Before cocoon merchants ship dried cocoons, the association will be responsible for encouraging them to pay an improvement fee of three yuan per dried cocoon load. Director Yan and Deputy Director Cai believe that the above measures seem feasible and have gone to the province to request instructions before making a final decision.</p>
<p>(2) It has been decided that silkworm seed control will be implemented in the autumn season of this year. Yesterday, the model district issued a public notice stating that all improved silkworm seeds will be managed by the model district, directly distributed to silkworm farmers, and merchants are not allowed to buy or sell them. It is also stipulated that the price of each autumn seed sheet is five jiao. However, the selling price at the seed farm must be at least eight jiao and five fen per sheet. The deficit of three jiao and five fen will be subsidized from the collected improvement fees. Tang Xixiang, the director of the sericulture testing field stationed in the province, has received instructions from Director Shen of the Department of Construction that the province has decided to allocate 300,000 yuan in advance to purchase autumn seeds from seed farms, which will be reimbursed from the improvement fees in the future.</p>
<p>(3) Now that seed prices have been lowered, the number of silkworm farmers will inevitably increase. Whether there will be enough mulberry leaves will become a problem. Director Shen has ordered the sericulture testing field to conduct a thorough survey of mulberry leaf production. After statistics are available, silkworm seeds will be issued according to the amount.</p>
<h3>A Good Opportunity for the Development of Chinese Silk</h3>
<p>The New York Mercantile Exchange previously only allowed Japanese silk to be traded, which aroused strong opposition from the Chinese silk industry. However, due to the encirclement by Japanese merchants, this did not materialize, leading to the further decline of Chinese silk. Now, the exchange will vote to resolve the issue of whether Chinese and Italian silk can be traded on the exchange. If this is realized, it will provide a good opportunity for the development of Chinese silk. Zeng Yangfu, the chairman of the Sericulture Improvement Committee of the National Economic Council, has already telegraphed the NEC to forward a telegram to the Chinese ambassador to the United States and the consul in New York, requesting them to visit the exchange and influential figures in the American silk industry to explain the advantages and disadvantages in detail in order to achieve this goal. He also telegraphed the national silk industry to strive for it together. Qian Fenghao, the chairman of the Wuxi Silk Factory Trade Association, received Zeng's telegram yesterday and immediately telegraphed the NEC and the Sericulture Improvement Committee, requesting them to strive for it together.</p>
<h3>Stone Worker Stabbed to Death in the Dark While Attempting Rape</h3>
<p>Chen Desheng from Dongtai, 43 years old, was a helmsman on patrol boat No. 3 of the 2nd squad of the 10th team of the waterside police force stationed in Wuxi. His wife, Xuan, 44 years old, is now a female worker quarrying yellow stone at Baogei Mountain in the 3rd district of this county (preparing for the construction of the around-the-lake road). They have a son and a daughter. The son, Chunbao, 21 years old, also serves in the waterside police. The daughter, Guibao, 17 years old, lives with her mother near Qingqi Township, Baogei Mountain. The day before yesterday, Desheng took three days of leave to return home to enjoy family time with his wife and daughter. Yesterday (the 1st) morning, at about one o'clock, Desheng was sound asleep with his wife and daughter when Zhou Qunshan, a fellow villager (also a worker quarrying yellow stone there), carrying two daggers, secretly entered Chen's house and attempted to rape Xuan. When Xuan refused, Zhou immediately drew a dagger and stabbed her left knee, creating a wound about half an inch long and two or three fen deep. Xuan cried out in pain, waking Desheng. Desheng immediately got up and fought Qunshan in the dark. Both daggers in Qunshan's hands were taken away by Desheng. Desheng then stabbed Qunshan wildly, causing blood to flow. Knowing that he was no match, Qunshan fled out the door. However, because he was severely injured, he collapsed in a wheat field by the roadside after walking only a dozen steps. At that time, nearby male and female workers had come out after hearing the noise. Seeing the situation, they immediately watched over Chen Desheng and his wife, along with their daughter Guibao. After dawn, they were tied up and sent to the 2nd police substation of the 8th public security precinct. The patrol officer, Cao Shengxian, held a preliminary hearing and ordered them all to be temporarily detained, awaiting transfer to the city for legal proceedings. Meanwhile, Su Shifa, the head of the 263rd district, came to the city to report to the local branch court, requesting an examination of Zhou Qunshan's body, and notified Qunshan's brother, Cunfa, to come to the village to handle the matter.</p>

<h3>Unified Collection of Local Miscellaneous Taxes</h3>
<p>The county government, upon the order of the Department of Finance, is reorganizing the unified collection of local miscellaneous taxes. It specially summoned various collection agencies and held a meeting at the county government the day before yesterday and made the following decisions: (1) From July 1st, the county will print receipts for all miscellaneous taxes and issue them to the original collecting agencies for collection. At the end of each month, quarter, or year, according to the collection period, the receipts will be submitted and delivered to the county government for receipt. (2) The security donation will be collected by the district regiment headquarters and submitted on schedule. (3) Each agency should send the original receipt format to the county for reference so that a new receipt format can be determined. (4) The house tax will be collected jointly by the 1st district public office and the education property management office. (5) If the miscellaneous taxes were previously submitted to the property office or collected by the county government and included in the county funds for overall distribution, they should all be submitted to the county in the future and transferred to the county treasury. If the miscellaneous taxes were collected and used by each agency themselves, the collected donations should be submitted to the county government and then reclaimed by the original agency upon presentation of a receipt. (6) The public security bureau is required to submit at least 500 yuan per month for the store tax. If the amount collected is insufficient, the bureau will be liable for the difference, which will be deducted when the funds are issued. All surplus funds will be submitted in full.</p>

<h3>Resumption of Business in Shierwei</h3>
<p>The boatmen and workers of Shierwei, who were competing between steamers and sailing vessels, sent representatives to Beijing to petition. Because they did not get what they wanted, a general strike was triggered. The Ministry of Finance ordered the public offices on both sides of the river to reallocate 100 steamer tickets for the Xiang shore and completely convert 200 small steamer tickets for the Wan shore to sailing vessels. According to Zheng Funan of the Lianghuai Salt Affairs Office, who returned to Yangzhou from Shierwei, the merchants have all reopened for business, but the salt workers have not yet indicated that they will resume work.</p>

<h3>Tragic Suicide of an Elementary School Teacher Due to Unpaid Salary</h3>
<p>The financial difficulties of the county's education funds have reached an extreme point. Xu Zhaozong, the director of the education bureau, has recently mentioned the possibility of canceling subsidies. After this news spread, elementary school teachers were extremely alarmed, resulting in a suicide by lying on the railway tracks. Zhu Qixiang, a native of this county, had been an elementary school teacher in a certain school in the district for many years, owing a considerable amount of back pay. Unable to obtain payment after repeated demands, Qixiang was forced to commit suicide out of anger. The day before yesterday, late at night, he secretly lay down on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway bridge No. 36. Because it was dark, he was run over by the train wheels and died. It was not until this morning that a farmer going to the market discovered the incident. The farmer reported it to the local police. A crowd gathered and saw the deceased lying face down on the iron bridge, with his waist crushed by the wheels. The scene was extremely tragic.</p>

<h3>World Bookstore Completely Burned Down</h3>
<p>The World Bookstore on Cuiya Street in this port has been open for ten years. It has been managed by Zhi Xiaoyun, a native of Zhenhai. There are thirteen employees and apprentices in total. Because the store is small, there is a warehouse in Sha帽di. Employees sleep in the warehouse at night, and six apprentices sleep in the store. Four of them sleep in the store hall, and two sleep upstairs. The store does not usually have cooking fires. The employees all eat boxed lunches. Last night, around 10:30, a fire suddenly broke out in the books in the store hall. The ladder was soon burned down. When the apprentices Xu Dingwan and Wang Yifu heard the fire downstairs, they jumped out of the windows upstairs. In a short time, they were gone. Later, the various fire brigades arrived after hearing the alarm and put out the fire after about half an hour. In addition to the complete destruction of the bookstore, the overhanging building of the Changhe Foreign Goods Store to the left and the three-story single room of the China Rubber Raincoat Cloth Factory's retail department to the right were also affected, as well as the top of the three-story building of the Weiyuan General Goods Store. The estimated loss is over 20,000 yuan. The missing apprentice Xu Dingwan has not yet been found and is currently being searched for.</p>

<h3>Careless Silk Reeling Causes Fire Spreading to Eleven Homes</h3>
<p>Zhu Alan, a farmer in Shengdi Township, 6th district of Xiaoshan, because the spring cocoon prices raised this year have plummeted and the value is not enough to offset the leaf prices, was reeling fresh cocoons into silk on the night of the 30th. Unexpectedly, a fire was left unattended in the firewood overnight, which spread to the kitchen and quickly engulfed the sky with flames, making it impossible to approach. It then spread to ten neighboring homes, causing losses of over 30,000 yuan. Also, Zhu Alan's twelve-year-old daughter, who was sleeping soundly in the room when the fire broke out, did not have time to escape and was tragically burned to death.</p>

<h3>National Products Movement Exhibition Opened Yesterday Representative of the Ministry of Industry He Bingxian Unveiled the Ceremony Mayor's Representative Zhang Yuanruo Raised the Flag</h3>
<p>▲·········▲</p>
<p>Over Ten Thousand People Attended, Creating a Grand Occasion</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Movement Exhibition, sponsored by the China National Products Manufacturers Association, held its opening ceremony yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. Representative of the Ministry of Industry He Bingxian unveiled the ceremony, and Mayor Wu's representative Zhang Yuanruo raised the flag. No fewer than ten thousand representatives from all walks of life and guests attended the ceremony. The ceremony was very grand. The speeches by the guests elaborated on the meaning of promoting national products in great detail. There was also entertainment to add to the excitement. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>(A Glimpse of the Venue)</h3>
<p>The exhibition venue is located between Xiaoximen, Penglai Road, and Yongning Road, covering an area of more than ten acres. Two large pine and cypress archways were built along the road, with the words "Production Saves the Country," "National Products Save the Country," and "Shanghai National Products Movement Exhibition" written on them. The couplets read "Concentrate national production, develop national spirit," "Do not let millions of dollars flow into foreign lands, remember the heavy national humiliation in your hearts," "Economic aggression is worse than military aggression, the national products movement is a salvation movement," "Come here and I guarantee you will be excited and inspired, and marvel at the sight," "From today onwards, whether it is clothing, food, housing, or transportation, use national products." The venue is full of exquisite national products displayed by various factories. Ladies from all walks of life were very enthusiastic to visit. In the center of the venue, there is a large auditorium with a portrait of Sun Yat-sen hanging in the middle, with the party and national flags crossed on both sides. The center of the stage is for the chairman and representatives from all walks of life, and the right is for the record seat. The layout is simple and neat. In front, there is a large advertising sign of Taikang Company, which is two zhang high and about ten zhang wide, which is especially eye-catching. Around the venue, the security team of the Public Security Bureau maintained order.</p>
<h3>(Guest Signatures)</h3>
<p>Guests who signed their names included Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, He Bingxian, Chen Yiting, Zhang Yichen, Hu Xiyuan, Chen Jicheng, Lin Kecong, Chen Binghui, Zhang Yuanruo, Wu Yushu, Lin Kanghou, Chen Jiufeng, Chen Jingsheng, Zheng Dongshan, Fang Yalan, Yu Zhongxian, Xu Genghua, Wang Hanzhang, Sun Chucheng, Xu Letian, and others.</p>
<h3>(Unveiling and Flag Raising)</h3>
<p>At 2:00 PM, the music team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau played music to open the meeting. The members of the presidium Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Wu Zhihao, Wang Yansong, Yu Hualong, Zhang Yichen, Chen Jicheng, Chen Binghui, Liu Zhongying, Xue Fuji, Hu Xiyuan, Zhang Yuanruo, He Bingxian, and representatives from various party and government circles entered the venue in succession and circled to the main entrance of the assembly. The representative of the Ministry of Industry, He Bingxian, cut the ribbon at the main gate, and the whole audience burst into thunderous applause. The chairman then led Mayor Wu's representative, Zhang Yuanruo, to walk to the flagpole and held the flag-raising ceremony amid the melodious music.</p>
<h3>(Chairman's Report)</h3>
<p>After the chairman group finished the unveiling and flag-raising ceremony, they returned to the podium. Chairman Wang Yansong gave a brief report, saying, "Today is the day for the opening ceremony of the Shanghai National Products Movement Exhibition. Today, everyone knows that national products should be promoted. Therefore, national products movements have been held repeatedly. Although the results are slightly better than in previous years, there are still many areas where we need to continue to work hard. Looking at the customs report, in the midst of active resistance, inferior goods have been slightly affected. Up to now, inferior goods have become active again and will be sold to the Chinese market again, which is very worrying. I hope that in the future, national products manufacturers will strive to improve their products, and citizens should also enthusiastically purchase and use them, so that our national economy will not be completely invaded and the national lifeline will not be severely destroyed."</p>
<h3>(Representative's Speech)</h3>
<p>Next, He Bingxian, Director of the Bureau of International Trade and Representative of the Ministry of Industry, delivered a speech. He said, "Since our country has traded with various countries, the annual import surplus has always been between 700 million and 800 million yuan. Why is the import surplus so large and there are so many foreign goods? This is because our country itself cannot have a large production of national products. If there are few national products, we cannot have an export surplus and cannot find markets abroad. National products merchants should be alert in the future and not be obsessed with making profits. If they see that someone is making a profit with a certain product, they will rush to it. They should create their own and not compete with each other. Also, business should not be expected to make a ten thousandfold profit, because this is impossible in economics. It is okay to invest money in business, but speculation is absolutely not allowed. This is the humble opinion I offer at the meeting today." Next, Zhang Yuanruo, the representative of the municipal government, gave a speech, saying, "Why are Chinese people poor and Europeans and Americans rich? It is because Chinese people want to send money to foreigners. In the future, to carry out the national products movement, all Chinese people must work hard and not send money to foreigners. Looking at the German man Haijing Bo, who came to Shanghai last year to do circus performances, he brought everything, no matter how small, from Germany. The Germans were unwilling to give a penny to our people. This kind of spirit is worth emulating. Diligence and hard work are essential to promoting national products." Next, Wang Xiaolai, the representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, gave a speech, saying, "Promoting national products is useless to talk empty words. We must make up our minds to find a way out. First, do not buy things (Western goods), and second, do not spend useless money, such as cigarettes, which should not be consumed at all, because this thing is completely burned to ashes, and the raw materials are all foreign goods." Finally, Lin Kecong, the representative of the Women's National Products Year Movement Committee, Chen Jingsheng, the representative of the Bureau of International Trade, Chen Yiting, Chen Jicheng, Tao Leqin, Yu Zhongxian, Cao Zhigong, and others gave speeches. The full text is omitted.</p>
<h3>(Tour of the Assembly)</h3>
<p>Inside the venue, more than 600 temporary sheds were built. The arrangements of each factory were colorful and had everything. The Huatong Electrical Manufacturing Factory and Taikang Food Company were the most eye-catching. The whole venue had more than ten planned routes, including Salvation Road, National Products Road, Northeast Road, Production Road, Industry Road, Fengtian Road, Jilin Road, Heilongjiang Road, Rehe Road, Manufacturer Road, People's Livelihood Road, and New Life Road. The streets were clean and orderly.</p>
<h3>Radio Broadcast</h3>
<p>After the opening ceremony of the assembly, the presidium Chen Binghui and others went to the radio station to broadcast, with the themes "The National Products Movement is a Salvation Movement," "Only Hard Work in Production Can Save Us from Danger," and "National Products are an Iron Army to Resist Aggression," which ended around 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Entertainment</h3>
<p>In order to increase the audience's interest, the association hired members of the Gujin Troupe to perform entertainment, with the programs "From Now on Prosperity," "Du Shiniang," and singing and dancing. More than 50 members of the troupe performed on stage, and the audience was very enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>The May Festival Passed Safely, Guard Was Lifted Yesterday, Tomorrow is the Communist Party Memorial, So Temporary Precautions Are Still Necessary</h3>
<p>The eventful May Festival has passed safely. The Municipal Public Security Bureau lifted the all-day alert yesterday. However, tomorrow is the Communist Party Memorial Day, so it ordered the subordinates to intensify precautions according to the usual alert methods. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Guard Lifted Yesterday</h3>
<p>In order to maintain local security during the May Revolution Memorial Festival, the Municipal Public Security Bureau ordered all districts to implement alerts and decided on joint defense measures with the Songhu Garrison Command, the Security Office, and other agencies to cooperate. From the May 1st Labor Day to the May 30th Nanjing Road Massacre Memorial Day, the entire month was under intensified prevention. Fortunately, no disturbances occurred. Now that the May Festival has passed, Wen Hongen, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, will lift the all-month alert order from yesterday and encourage the heads of the various districts to work hard to defend the local area. In the future, on memorial days, the usual precautions will be taken.</p>
<h3>Temporary Precautions Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Tomorrow (June 3rd) is the memorial day for the establishment of the Communist Party's Shanghai Federation of Industry, Commerce and Students. The authorities of the Chinese Concession Police reported that the Communist Party will hold a demonstration on that day, which will likely cause disturbances. Therefore, a temporary alert was announced for one day. Wen Hongen, Director of the Public Security Bureau, ordered all districts under his command to dispatch additional officers to patrol and inspectors and detectives to lead plainclothes inspectors to check pedestrians at the border of the Chinese Concession to maintain peace within the boundary.</p>
<h3>Yesterday Was the Memorial Day of Sun Yat-sen's Burial, Flags Were Flown at Half-Mast and Entertainment Was Suspended to Mourn</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reported that yesterday was the memorial day of the burial of Sun Yat-sen, the leader of the Chinese Kuomintang. The Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Government issued a notice to all subordinate agencies, groups, and party headquarters at all levels to fly flags at half-mast and suspend entertainment for one day to express mourning. Military and police agencies were also ordered to take additional precautions.</p>
<h3>Gengkuan British Gold Bonds Underwritten by Four Chinese and Foreign Banks Decision to Issue Subscription Vouchers First</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News reported that the 6% British Gold Gengkuan Bonds of 1.5 million pounds of the 23rd year of the Republic of China were issued yesterday and were underwritten by the four banks, the Central, China, Communications, and HSBC. The contract is about to be signed, and it was decided to issue subscription vouchers first. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Signing the Contract The Ministry of Railways, in order to complete the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, used the Gengkuan as collateral and, together with the Ministry of Finance, issued the 6% British Gold Gengkuan Bonds of the 23rd year of the Republic of China yesterday, which was underwritten by the four banks, the Central, China, Communications, and HSBC. It was stipulated that it would be issued at 96% of the face value. However, the underwriting of the four banks was slightly lower than the 96% issuance. The Ministry of Finance has negotiated with the four banks, HSBC, etc., and the underwriting is appropriate. The contract has been drafted and can be officially signed in the coming days.</p>
<p>Issuing Subscription Vouchers A reporter from Xin Sheng News learned from the banking industry yesterday that after these bonds are underwritten by the four banks, the Central Bank, etc., the four banks will promote them to domestic banks. If domestic banks and domestic banks want to purchase these bonds, they will be managed by the four underwriting banks. As for these bonds, they have not yet been printed. The Ministry of Finance has decided to issue subscription vouchers first and then exchange them after the bonds are printed. Although the subscription vouchers can be freely bought, sold, and mortgaged, they cannot circulate in the bond market.</p>
<p>A Nanjing telegram from the Central News Agency on the 1st stated that a total of 1.5 million pounds of 6% British Gold Gengkuan Bonds of the 23rd year of the Republic of China were issued on the 1st. It is stipulated that the first principal will be repaid on January 1st next year, and the principal and interest will be fully repaid by January 1st of the 36th year. These bonds will be used as a construction fund to complete the Guangdong-Hankou Railway and were issued on the 1st.</p>
<h3>The Face Value of the Italian Gengkuan Loan Certificate Has Been Agreed Upon with the Banking Group by the Ministry of Finance</h3>
<p>Each Bank Will Issue Four Certificates of Principal and Interest Per Month</p>
<p>The Banking Group is Allowed to Mortgage to the Central Bank and the Preparatory Committee</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance will use the Gengkuan returned by Italy as collateral to borrow 44 million yuan from 16 banks including the Central Bank. The loans have long been paid in full by the various borrowing banks. The face value of the loan certificates has been agreed upon with the banking group organized by the 16 banks including the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance and can be mortgaged to the Central Bank and the Shanghai Bankers Association Joint Preparatory Committee at any time for circulation in the market. As for the rumor from the Beijing telegram yesterday that the Ministry of Finance issued 30 million yuan in securities, it is not accurate. The details learned by the reporter from Xin Xin News are recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Repaying Principal and Interest According to the loan contract, the certificates that the Ministry of Finance should issue to the banking group, the certificates from January to June of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, have been handed over to the banking group by the Ministry of Finance at the end of April and transferred to the various borrowing banks. As for the principal and interest due at the end of May, it was paid by the Customs to the Central Bank on the 31st, and the Central Bank transferred it to the banking group, and then the banking group distributed it to the various borrowing banks separately, which was paid in full.</p>
<p>Face Value of the Certificate The number of certificates has been agreed upon by both the Ministry of Finance and the banking group. The method is that each bank will issue two certificates of principal and interest each month, one of which is an integer and the other is a zero. For example, if a bank borrows 35,600 yuan, 30,000 yuan will be written on one certificate, and 5,600 yuan will be written on another certificate. The other two certificates will write the interest amount of integers and zeros. It is also heard that the certificates have been commissioned by the National Treasury Department of the Ministry of Finance to be printed by the Shanghai China Bookstore and will be implemented from July this year.</p>
<p>Permission to Mortgage According to the loan contract, the banking group is originally allowed to issue 30 million yuan of securities at one time. After the Ministry of Finance negotiated with the banking group, the Ministry of Finance issued certificates for mutual mortgage, and the issuance of 30 million yuan of securities was suspended. According to a reporter from Xin Xin News, who learned from the banking group, in order to regulate finance, the Ministry of Finance, in addition to stipulating that the certificates can be mortgaged to the banking group banks, has now also allowed them to be mortgaged to the Central Bank and the Shanghai Bankers Association Joint Preparatory Committee at any time for circulation in the market.</p>
<p>Beijing Telegram Misreported Yesterday, a Beijing telegram said that the Ministry of Finance had obtained the consent of the banking group to change the previous 30 million yuan of securities to be issued by the Ministry of Finance, and the losses suffered by the banking group would be recognized and subsidized by the Ministry of Finance. Yesterday, a reporter from Xin Xin News specially inquired about this from various aspects of the banking industry and the banking group in this city. The rumor is completely inaccurate and is impossible in fact. The Italian Gengkuan has been borrowed by the Ministry of Finance from the banking group, and the cash has been used. If another 30 million yuan of securities is issued, it is the same collateral used for two different mortgages. Not only will the banking group be unable to agree, but the Ministry of Finance may not have this opinion. Moreover, the Ministry of Finance has now designated certificates that can be mortgaged to each other at any time, so there is no need to issue securities again.</p>

<h3>The Central Gengkuan [Boxer Indemnity Funds] Board of Directors Approves Distribution Amounts</h3>
<p>The Board of Directors for the management of the British Boxer Indemnity Funds, since its establishment, has been in operation for over three years. In accordance with the resolutions of the Central Political Conference and the exchange of notes between China and Britain, the Gengkuan funds under the Board's management must first be used as a fund for the reorganization of railways and other productive enterprises, and then the 5% interest income from the loans will be used to subsidize educational and cultural undertakings.

A subsidy of 12,000 yuan to Qinghai Province to build an elementary school (the interest income allocated to Category E, totaling 288,000 yuan, in addition to subsidizing the above three cases, there is a remaining balance of 1,589 yuan, which will be rolled into the reserve fund). The above categories distribute 1.2 million yuan, plus 137,589 yuan borrowed from the special reserve fund, totaling 1,336,000 yuan. According to the person in charge of the Board, from the start of the formal review of cases to the present, there have been a total of 121 cases, with the total amount of requested funds reaching more than 56 million yuan, which is far different from the amount of interest income received, making the distribution even more difficult. Therefore, based on the previously established distribution standards, and after repeated deliberation, the current urgent needs of domestic educational and cultural undertakings were used as the basis for the review, to provide relatively favorable subsidies: (1) The capital is the focus of attention from all sides and should also be the cultural center of the country, so the construction of the two Central Museums and Libraries should be based on the established cases when the Board was first established, and make every effort to assist in promoting their establishment. (2) After the Jiangxi bandit area was recovered, the economy collapsed, and people's livelihood was devastated. Recruiting the displaced people is precisely to curb the emergence of chaos and to handle the aftermath. The need for funds is particularly urgent, so subsidies should be given for the special rural education in the recovered bandit area to facilitate its implementation. (3) The current applications for funds are mostly from higher education institutions. Since it is impossible to distribute them universally, we can only follow the previously established distribution standards and give priority to the four disciplines of agriculture, engineering, medicine, and science, and to those who have submitted relatively concrete plans, and provide as much assistance as possible. For those who request fees in more than two types, we will consider the situation and select the essentials for assistance. For example, those who subsidize construction fees will no longer subsidize equipment fees, and those who subsidize equipment fees will no longer subsidize construction fees. (4) In order to promote the development of culture and education in remote provinces, even if there are no requests that fully meet the standards and concrete plans, special subsidies will be given within the possible scope. (5) According to the resolution of the 16th meeting of the Board of Directors, 20 students should be sent to the UK every year. In addition to the nine students who have already been sent last year, it is planned to send another 30 students this year, plus the vacancy of 11 from last year, for a total of 31. Therefore, this scholarship fund should be reserved first for application.</p>

<h3>Ma Yinchu Discusses Banning Prize Savings</h3>
<p>Encouraging Luck Hinders Proper Savings</p>
<p>Capital Flows Out of the Interior, Causing Rural Hardship</p>
<p>Treaties Offer No Basis, Prohibition Should Not Be Hesitated</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that Ma Yinchu, Chairman of the Finance Committee of the Legislative Yuan, is highly regarded in China's financial and economic circles. At the National Financial Conference, he proposed to strictly prohibit the Sino-French and International Savings Societies and drafted (1) restrictions on future membership, (2) thorough investigation of the funds of both societies. After deliberation, it was decided to hand over the matter to the Ministry of Finance for verification. Ma Gong also believes that this kind of prize savings is extremely harmful to the national economy and people's livelihood, and for the purpose of making the people understand the inside story, he specially explained to the reporter of the Xin Sheng Beijing News the five greatest reasons for banning them and his personal feelings. The recorded comments are as follows:</p>
<h3>Financial Conference</h3>
<p>This National Financial Conference is the first grand financial meeting since the establishment of the National Government, and its significance is profound. When our country implements a controlled economy in the future, financial control must also be implemented at the same time. This Financial Conference is no less than the initial step in implementing controlled finance. Its purpose is to reduce the additional burdens of field taxes, abolish exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, which can directly reduce the burden on farmers and indirectly promote production. It is an indispensable step for rescuing the rural economy today.</p>
<h3>Rescuing the Countryside</h3>
<p>Minister Kong also fully accommodated the proposals of this conference. The existing central stamp tax is not small, and at a time when finances are tight and all resources are exhausted, he was willing to resolutely allocate it for local application. His sincerity is evident. However, the aforementioned purpose of promoting production is complex and cannot be achieved simply by reducing the burden on farmers. What farmers lack is especially working capital. Therefore, rescuing the countryside and promoting production should especially involve lending low-interest, long-term funds to farmers. Farmers who are on the verge of death have hope of revival, and the purpose of promoting production can also be achieved. Currently, whether it is the academic community, the banking community, or people in political circles, they all unanimously call for the flow of funds from cities into the interior. Therefore, it can be said that their thinking is completely consistent.</p>
<h3>Investing in the Interior</h3>
<p>In fact, the banking community has invested a lot in the interior, such as railway investment, motor vehicle road investment, industrial investment, and electrical enterprise investment, which can be seen everywhere. Various banks have also established offices in the interior to directly lend funds to farmers, promote credit cooperatives, and buy and sell inland forward bills, all of which are aimed at realizing the hopes of all parties and have achieved excellent results. Since the financial community has taken such measures, the government authorities should also adopt a consistent policy, so that efforts can be concentrated and</p>
<p>things can be easily accomplished. Even in terms of savings funds, it should be the same, so that it can be invested in the interior as much as possible, which will benefit the rural economy.</p>
<h3>Many Evils of Prize Money</h3>
<p>However, today's prize savings is not the case. Not only can it not make savings funds flow into the interior, but the result is the opposite. It will cause funds from the interior to flow to the cities. Because the hard work of thrifty men and women in the interior is not enough to guarantee their lives, they all have a fluke mentality and try to seek improper gains, competing in speculation. The rural economy becomes more bankrupt, and their fluke mentality becomes even worse. The danger is very great. Prize savings is the most encouraging of fluke mentality, does not encourage thrift at all, and runs counter to the New Life Movement, which is being vigorously promoted. This is the first reason why it should be banned. The funds of prize savings not only flow from the countryside to the cities, contrary to our hopes, but also fear that most of them will flow overseas, causing harm to our country's industrialists. This is the second reason why it should be banned. Xu, Director of the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance, has made every effort to promote thrift among the people in his proposal for compulsory savings at the conference. For prize savings that pretend to encourage thrift but actually collect money, he should strictly prohibit it. This is the third reason.</p>
<h3>Should Be More Strict</h3>
<p>Now the central government has strictly prohibited various banks from running prize savings. Chinese and foreign companies should be treated equally. Why is one side already implementing it, while the other side is allowed to exist? Moreover, the establishment of this kind of foreign prize savings institution has no treaty basis, but we are timid and dare not ban it, which is very puzzling. The prize savings</p>
<p>funds of the Sino-French Savings Society and the International Savings Society have reached nearly</p>
<p>90 million, of which the International Savings Society has more than 60 million and the Sino-French Savings Society has 20-30 million. The rate of increase is quite fast. If this continues, in the future, it will reach hundreds of millions, and its power will become increasingly strong and its supernatural powers will be vast. Our government will have the danger of not being able to control it, because the temptation will be greater and it will be more difficult to deal with. Therefore, for this kind of prize savings, we now hope that the government authorities with morality will quickly find a way to ban it. This is the fourth reason. Moreover, after the prevalence of prize savings, genuine savings are not easy to develop, because the financial resources of the people are limited. If they are abundant in this, they must be stingy in that. Therefore, if you want the genuine savings business to develop, you must prohibit prize savings. Now, the two prize savings societies not only set up shops in commercial ports to operate, but also set up offices in the interior. Local governments should also strictly prohibit them. This is the fifth reason.</p>
<h3>Hard to Hesitate Again</h3>
<p>In short, the prohibition of prize savings is a major matter, and the people from four aspects must work together to achieve the hope of reaching the goal: (1) Legislative aspect, (2) Party headquarters aspect, (4) Public opinion aspect. Newspapers are representatives of public opinion. Now the legislative public opinion Party headquarters and other parties are of course standing in opposition. We should combine and urge the administrative aspects to carry out the work in a practical manner. When savings funds only reached 20-30 million in the past, I already cried out loudly and strongly opposed it, but the financial authorities insisted on long-term research and delayed it. Now it has reached 60-70 million, and the financial authorities still have not changed their old habit of long-term research. I don't know when the research will have results. The situation is really something that outsiders cannot know. In my personal opinion, there is really no room for hesitation. I hope that the academic community and domestic scholars, Party headquarters and legislative aspects, will work together and unanimously advocate that the administrative side proceed as soon as possible to avoid being accused of regret and benefiting the rural economy.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Visited Kong Yesterday; Song May Go to Beijing Next Monday or Tuesday.</h3>
<p>Song Ziwen, standing committee member of the National Economic Commission, has been organizing his inspection report in his residence after returning from his inspection of the Northwest, preparing to report it to the NEC standing committee when he travels to Beijing. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Song visited Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi and his wife for an hour. Kong excused himself first to go to the Central Bank. It is reported that Song has completed a part of the report and will first go to Beijing around Monday or Tuesday next week.</p>
<h3>Huang Fu and Ariyoshi Did Not Meet Yesterday; Huang Is Scheduled to Go to Beijing on the Same Day.</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that Huang Fu, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Reorganization Committee, and Akira Ariyoshi, Japanese Ambassador to China, had not met until last night. Huang remained behind closed doors yesterday morning, refusing to see people from all walks of life. However, according to those around him, Chairman Huang is determined to go to Beijing within a few days to visit President Wang and then go north. Before leaving Shanghai, he will have an ordinary courtesy meeting with Japanese Ambassador Ariyoshi. As for Tang Youren, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, he met with Huang after arriving in Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday. He went out to visit friends yesterday morning and had not returned to his residence by noon. It is reported that his hand injury has not completely healed.</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Radio Telegraph Put into Operation Yesterday; Four Japanese Type-Punching Machines Added; Heavy Traffic Yesterday.</h3>
<p>The Sino-Japanese radio telegraph, which was being prepared by the International Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, was put into operation at zero hours yesterday morning. There was a lot of traffic between the two sides. The Chinese headquarters is in Zhenru, while the Japanese headquarters is in Tokyo. Therefore, all telegrams sent from Shanghai to Japan are forwarded by the Tokyo headquarters to the recipients. Telegrams sent from Japan to China are forwarded by the Shanghai headquarters. The procedure is still convenient.</p>
<h3>Additional Purchase of Japanese Machines</h3>
<p>This Sino-Japanese communication uses the Chinese, English, and Japanese languages. Type-punching machines for the Chinese and English languages have been purchased by the radio stations. However, type-punching machines for the Japanese language are still missing. Therefore, the station had to purchase additional equipment from Japan for application. There are four of these machines, which were brought to Shanghai on the 30th of last month by engineers Hirako Taro, Shinhuri Masayoshi, and Shimada Shinjiro from the Tokyo Radio Station of Japan. They visited Engineer Zhang of the International Radio Station to hand over the machines for application.</p>
<h3>Charging Method</h3>
<p>The telegram fee from Shanghai to Japan is 75 centimes per word. According to the current market price,</p>
<p>one franc is equal to one yuan in Chinese currency, which is 7.5 jiao per word. For Chinese and Japanese telegrams, the fee is charged according to the number of words. According to the regulations of the station, (1) the name, address, place of delivery, and name and address of the recipient, regardless of the number of words, are all counted as one word. However, for copied telegrams, an additional word should be charged for each additional recipient name and address. (2) For Chinese telegrams, numbers can be used to write continuously, such as the two characters "Zhong Hua" can be written as "○○二二五四七</p>
<p>八." Every seven numbers are counted as one word, which is more than three times cheaper than the original method of calculating fees for foreign language telegrams. For Japanese telegrams, Japanese kana must be used to write, and every seven kana are counted as one word. The International Cloud Terrace in Sassoon House on Nanjing Road also has detailed methods for inquiries from all walks of life.</p>
<h3>Jing'an Steamer Lawsuit</h3>
<p>The Court Ordered a Guarantee of 80,000 Yuan, Not Compensation; the Company Has Not Acknowledged It and Has Petitioned the Government for Review.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Qiaqing, General Manager of Sanbei Steamer Wharf Co., Ltd., sent a letter to this newspaper yesterday, saying that he had read in today's newspaper that the company's Jing'an steamer had lost the lawsuit and the court had ruled to pay 80,000 yuan in compensation. This is inconsistent with the facts. The court ordered the company to provide a guarantee of 80,000 yuan in valuable securities. The company believes that the court failed to deal with the matter in accordance with maritime conditions, and the plaintiff was actually guilty of false accusation. Failure to order a guarantee sets a bad precedent that is relevant to the national shipping industry and cannot be approved. It has already petitioned the government for review. The report in your newspaper has a relationship with the company's reputation and business. The corresponding letter is for investigation and correction. The Shanghai Local Court's criminal instruction of May 29 is appended below: Yu Qiaqing's request for the return of the Jing'an steamer is known. Since the company claims that the Jing'an steamer belongs to the company and the company is responsible for fulfilling the judgment in the future, immediately issue a certificate and submit it to the court for verification so that it can be released. This instruction.</p>
<h3>The New Life Movement Counseling Team Schedules a Periodic Inspection</h3>

It is reported that there will be more than 700 teams attending the event. In addition to inviting physicians from the Health Bureau to be responsible for health matters, the standing directors of the New Life Promotion Association will also be present to give instructions.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Sponsors the Red Cross's Membership Recruitment Campaign</h3>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross has recently been recruiting members and telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Military Affairs Commission to request that he order all division commanders to freely join the association.

The Lama walked to the podium, where President Shen Pengfei introduced him. The Lama then began his lecture, (translated by Wang Dejun), saying, "Gentlemen, students, I am honored to be invited by your President to visit and give a lecture. I don't have much to say, but recalling my departure from Tibet more than a decade ago, I have witnessed the year-by-year progress of domestic politics, which I find most gratifying. This credit, of course, goes to the late Premier Sun Yat-sen. We know that the Premier's doctrine is one of national salvation, and I hope it will be realized soon. I also hope that you, the students, will work hard to promote its realization, because schools are of great importance. A country's schools are a key element, and if schools perform well, the country will naturally be saved. The Premier's works have also expressed the hope that everyone will strive to alleviate human suffering in the future and seek national equality. As for myself, I have gained a lot of experience in the mainland over the past decade, and recently, I will use what I have learned, following the instructions of the central government, to resolve the disputes between Kang and Tibet and restore China's original glory. I also hope that everyone will provide assistance. Finally, I hope that if Tibetan students come to the mainland to study in the future, perhaps they will come to your school, and I hope you will guide them." After the lecture, he visited the library and physics and chemistry laboratories, and then took a car to the Wuqian Radio Station for a visit.</p>

<h3>Xie Zhongle Fills Vacancy on Chamber of Commerce Executive Committee Due to Xiang Songmao's Death</h3>
<p>Following Xiang Songmao's death during the January 28th Incident, his remains were not recovered and his family did not make a declaration, and the General Principles of the Civil Code stipulate that a missing person can only be considered dead after three years of disappearance and a declaration. Therefore, the vacancy has not been filled. Now, since his family has held a funeral, but the formality of a declaration of death is still lacking, the Chamber of Commerce submitted a request to the Bureau of Social Affairs for instructions on whether to fill the vacancy. On the 30th of this month, the Chamber of Commerce received approval No. 3996 from the Bureau of Social Affairs, which stated, "The matter has been noted. Since Xiang Songmao, an Executive Committee member of the Chamber of Commerce, has been deceased for a long time and his position is vacant, the vacant Executive Committee position should be filled by the alternate committee members in order of precedence. Please be informed accordingly." Upon receiving this approval, the order of the alternate Executive Committee members was checked, and it was determined that the vacancy should be filled by Xie Zhongle. Mr. Xie has already been notified to fill the vacancy.</p>

<h3>"Gongping" Vessel Importing Goods Yesterday Damaged Cargo Ship at Dock Due to Broken Cable While Turning, Cargo Ship Carrying Matchsticks Hit</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Gongping" vessel, which arrived in Shanghai yesterday carrying goods from Qingdao, broke a mooring cable while entering the port and crashed into a cargo barge, causing significant losses. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Cable Breaks, Vessel Crashes</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Gongping" vessel, which arrived in Shanghai from Qingdao yesterday, entered the port around 3 p.m. When the vessel reached the Jinliyuan dock on the South Bund, it was preparing to moor alongside the riverbank. The "Gongping" first used a steel cable to secure to the riverbank, then began to turn to moor. Unexpectedly, the tide was high and the current was strong, and the steel cable suddenly snapped. The "Gongping" vessel's hull suddenly leaned sharply towards the dock, and there was a cargo barge moored next to the dock, which was unable to avoid the collision and was destroyed.</p>
<p>Cargo Ship Damaged</p>
<p>A cargo barge belonging to Jinhongsheng, which was transporting 100 bundles of matchsticks from the Huachang Match Factory in Zhangjiabang, Pudong to the China Merchants' "Tonghua" vessel for shipment to Shantou, was in the process of customs inspection when the "Gongping" vessel's broken cable caused it to swing in and collide with the barge. The cargo ship was unable to avoid the collision, and its stern was completely destroyed by the "Gongping" vessel. The cargo that fell into the water was later retrieved. The boatmen on the cargo barge jumped onto the dock and were fortunately unharmed.</p>
<p>Aftermath</p>
<p>After the incident, the Jinhongsheng cargo barge fortunately</p>
<p>was close to the dock and did not sink. It was towed to a sheltered area of the dock. The boat captain reported the incident to the Water Police Station and prepared a list of losses in preparation for negotiating compensation. The owner of the "Gongping" vessel stated that the collision was due to an accident when the cable snapped. After the vessel was secured, he also reported to the Ship Department and General Manager Liu.</p>
<h3>Two Female Doctors at Shangxian Tang Women and Children's Hospital Accused of Negligence, Wife of "Shibao" Employee Dies Tragically in Hospital, Indicted for Manslaughter</h3>
<p>Ge Chenghui and Zhu Changya, two female doctors at the Shangxian Tang Women and Children's Hospital on Avenue Sa Po Se in the French Concession, have recently been privately sued in the Second Special District Court by Shen Wenda, an employee of the "Shibao" newspaper, on charges of manslaughter, requesting an investigation. The details were briefly reported in the previous newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, a summons was issued, and Judge Xiong Huiping presided over the hearing in the Second Criminal Court. Jin Xiongbo, the representative of the plaintiff, stated that the plaintiff suffered a major shock after the tragic death of his wife and was spitting blood, so he did not appear in court. The plaintiff's wife, Li, was sent to the Shangxian Tang Women and Children's Hospital last month for childbirth. At that time, the pregnant woman was in good health. Doctors Ge Chenghui and Zhu Changya were responsible for the delivery. By the next day, the baby had not been born and the amniotic fluid had broken. When the plaintiff inquired of others, he was told that once the amniotic fluid broke, it was important to seek medical treatment quickly, and any delay could be fatal. The plaintiff was greatly alarmed and rushed to ask the first defendant, Ge Chenghui, if she had any confidence in delivering the baby, when it would be born, and if there were any risks. Otherwise, he would transfer to another hospital. Ge replied solemnly that the hospital had considerable experience and guaranteed there would be no danger. The plaintiff was greatly relieved. However, on the 29th, he was suddenly told that the pregnant woman's condition was not good. The plaintiff was shocked and immediately called Dr. Zhong Shuzhen for a consultation, who said that there was no way to save her. The defendants then took advantage of the plaintiff's panic and forced him to sign a document stating that life and death were determined by fate. On May 1st, both mother and child died tragically in the hospital. In these circumstances, the defendants neglected their duties and violated Article 291, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code, requesting an investigation. Regarding the private prosecution, the plaintiff voluntarily abandoned it. The plaintiff's purpose was only to punish one as a warning to others. Defendant Ge Chenghui stated that Shen's wife was sent to the hospital on the morning of the 23rd, but she was managing the outpatient clinic downstairs and Dr. Zhu Changya was responsible for the plaintiff's wife. Occasionally, the plaintiff asked her to check on his wife's condition. At that time, the pregnant woman could eat and speak, and her condition was very good. However, on the 29th, she suddenly changed, but she was at the countryside visiting the doctor, so she did not know the circumstances of Li's death. However, there is a daily treatment chart for Li in the hospital, which can be presented as evidence for inspection. Zhu Changya said that Shen's wife came to the hospital and she was responsible for her. Her condition was usually very good, but she suddenly changed on the 29th. With the plaintiff's consent, Dr. Zhong was asked to invite Dr. Cai to the scene for treatment, but there was no way to save her. Judge Tai ordered them to leave and rescheduled a hearing to summon Dr. Zhong and Dr. Cai to testify.</p>

<h3>Jiangnan Shipyard's No. 3 Dock Will Soon Be Completed</h3>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, the Jiangnan Shipyard, which is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Navy, was established 69 years ago. In the third year after the opening of the factory, the No. 1 dock was built, which was 325 feet long. After many years, it was expanded to 375 feet. Later, because ships of more than 4,000 tons could not enter the dock for repairs, it was expanded to its current capacity, which is 545 feet long, 66 feet wide, and 20 feet deep. In the winter of 1925, the No. 2 dock was completed, equipped with new-style machinery. The dock is 502 feet long, 61 feet wide, and 23 feet deep, but it still cannot accommodate ships of more than 10,000 tons. Currently, with the development of Shanghai's port and the increasing number of ship repair projects, the factory authorities requested the Ministry of the Army to allocate a large area of land from the site of the Jiangnan Manufacturing Bureau for expansion. It was finally decided to build a 600-foot-long dry dock. Later, due to the outbreak of the January 28th Incident and financial constraints, the authorities had to change the original plan and decided to carry out the project in two stages. First, a smaller dock was built to meet the needs. Once it was completed, the second phase of the project would be carried out, and the total length would reach 600 feet, the width 100 feet, and the depth 26 feet, which would be able to accommodate ships of more than 10,000 tons and would be the largest of Shanghai's docks. The newly built dock, the No. 3 dock of the factory, is 375 feet long, 89 feet wide, and 26 feet deep. It was originally scheduled to be completed at the beginning of this month, but it has been postponed twice due to bad weather and will be completed in September. The first phase of the project is estimated to cost 1.2 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Prize Drawing for Resolute Brand Thermoses</h3>
<p>Bright Company - 10th Anniversary</p>
<p>Bright Manufacturing of Thermoses and Electrical Appliances Co., Ltd., located at 128 Museum Road in this city, is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year. To mark the occasion, it issued prize tickets, which have been selling exceptionally well. The company, in compliance with regulations, held the drawing yesterday at the Shanghai Bankers' Association. Attendees included Lin Kanghou, Wen Lanting, Pan Gongzhan, Wang Zikang, Pan Xulun, Chao Jimei, Zhang Qinxian, Pan Yangyao, Chen Riping, Feng Shaoshan, representatives Feng Langao and Wang Jiean, representative Chen Zian, Dr. Xia Shaoping, Lu Yuan, and over a hundred other guests. The gathering was lively and impressive. The meeting commenced at 2 PM, chaired by Liang Bozhi, Manager of the company, with Dr. Xia Shaoping as the master of ceremonies and Zhang Qinxian as the recorder. Chairman Liang reported, "Ladies and gentlemen, today is the day our company celebrates its 10th anniversary. We are honored by your presence and guidance, and my colleagues and I are deeply grateful. I feel somewhat ashamed that we don't have much to commemorate at this anniversary, but I will briefly report on the past ten years in two points. First, regarding thermoses in China ten years ago, when our company was first established, all thermoses on the market were imported. In terms of usage, inferior goods were obviously not suitable. While Western products were usable, they were very expensive, costing six, seven, or eight yuan each, making them inaccessible to the general public. Seeing this situation, we established our company ten years ago to manufacture thermoses, aiming to resist foreign goods and reduce imports. This goal was strongly supported by Minister Kong Xiangxi when he visited our factory five years ago. At the same time, we sought to make this hygienic product available to the entire nation. Our company considers this worthy of commemoration. Second, regarding the technology for manufacturing thermoses in China ten years ago, there were no factories or specialized personnel for making thermoses. Our company felt this was shameful, so we decided to use Chinese capital and domestic technicians to manufacture thermoses ourselves, sparing no expense in painstaking research. Although we had some success twelve or thirteen years ago, the manufacturing quality could not match Western products, so we chose to sacrifice profits and not sell them on the market, upholding our belief in elevating the status of domestic goods. By 1923, our company finally achieved excellent results. As soon as our products were launched, they became popular throughout the country and in Southeast Asia, receiving a warm welcome from all sectors of society. We also used various technologies to reduce prices and contribute to society, aiming for widespread use, making it a household necessity. Our company also considers this technology, which has had a great effect on public health, to be worthy of commemoration. These are the two points I wanted to report. This year marks our 10th anniversary, hence this celebration. However, ten years is a very short time. Just like a child from birth to ten years old is still in a very immature stage and cannot be considered an adult, our company feels the same way. We dare not be complacent and continue to work hard, and we sincerely hope for your continued support." Following this, Pan Gongzhan and Lin Kanghou delivered speeches, expressing their appreciation for the company's efforts over the past decade. At 3 PM, Lin Kanghou, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Jiean, representative Chen Zian, Feng Shaoshan, representative Feng Langao, and Wen Lanting supervised the drawing, with Chen Riping, an accounting expert, conducting the process. The winning numbers announced were: First Prize: 108870; Second Prize: 170052; Third Prize: 188778, 146212, 170325, 167999, etc. Fourth and Fifth Prizes were awarded based on the last four or two digits matching the First and Second Prize numbers. It is reported that the First Prize winner receives a round-trip first-class ticket to America.</p>
<h3>Expansion of Minsheng Agricultural Company</h3>
<p>Local industrialists Zhang Ziliang, Li Zhengzhi, and others, recognizing the current economic downturn in the country and the bankruptcy of rural areas, believe that only by striving for industrial relief can this crisis be averted. They have gathered like-minded individuals to organize a large-scale Minsheng Agricultural Company (temporarily located at Yongyu Lane, West Gate Road) to engage in agricultural production, focusing primarily on fruits, trees, fish, and livestock. The plan is well-thought-out and the capital is substantial. They have already purchased over 300 acres of arable land in Kunshan for preliminary agricultural use, as previously reported in various newspapers. It is now reported that the company will register with the Ministry of Industry and plans to seek suitable land near this city to gradually expand its operations and welcomes guidance from all sectors.</p>

<h3>Meiya Silk Weaving Factory Exhibits Fashion at the National Products Department Store, Holding a Lantern Festival for Three Consecutive Days Starting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Meiya Silk Weaving Factory in this city, recognizing the influx of foreign goods in recent years, believes that only by vigorously promoting national products can the situation be salvaged. Therefore, it has innovatively manufactured high-quality silk fabrics and is promoting them in the market. This year, China's silk industry has suffered due to the dumping of Japanese silk in Europe and America, leading to a slump. Silk prices have fallen daily, and the cost of silk products has gradually decreased, making silk fabrics inexpensive and comparable to foreign cloth prices. Recently, the factory has launched various new and innovative summer silk fabrics. To expand promotion, it is jointly holding a fashion display and lantern festival with the China National Products Company at the Continental Department Store, starting yesterday for a total of three days. The events will take place three times a day at 10 AM, 2 PM, and 6 PM, with a 10% discount for three days. The factory has hired six beautiful women to wear the newly produced fashions, sitting or standing on carts, which are pushed by apprentices from the Puyi Training Institute. At the front is the Party and National Flag military band, with a display stand every other person and a lantern. There are also advertisements and trademarks for the Watson Electric Appliance Factory, the Wuhe Weaving Factory, and the Da Zhonghua Enamel Factory. The display stands feature floral arrangements and Peking Opera scenes, including "Daiyu Burying Flowers," "Eliminating the Three Evils," "Zhaojun Leaving the塞," "Diaochan Worshipping the Moon," and various advertisements. The exhibition will be held at the department store for a week, attracting enthusiastic visitors who have expressed their admiration.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's North City National Products Department Store Celebrates Third Anniversary, Also Holding a Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition, Special Discount on Excellent National Products</h3>
<p>The North City National Products Department Store of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce (north end of Tianhou Temple Bridge) is the first large department store in Shanghai dedicated solely to national products. Since its opening three years ago, it has vigorously promoted all national products and sought ways to improve them. Therefore, its past achievements have long been trusted by all sectors. It is reported that June 6th will be the department store's third anniversary. In addition to the participating manufacturers offering special discounts on all their goods, a grand calligraphy and painting exhibition will also be held on the third floor of the department store to arouse public interest in using national products and to promote China's inherent great art. At that time, ancient famous paintings and works by famous artists will be displayed, such as Wang Yiting's calligraphy and paintings, which are rare works in modern times. Furthermore, Wang Xiaolai, the chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, who usually does not easily display his work, has taken time out of his busy schedule to create over a dozen couplets of calligraphy, hoping to provide fellow enthusiasts with a broad connection to the art of calligraphy and ink. Gathering ancient and modern famous calligraphy and paintings in one place is a rare opportunity.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Trust Company Hosts Foreign Guests</h3>
<p>Since moving to its new location at 190 Beijing Road, the corner of Sichuan Road, the Shanghai Trust Company has seen its business prosper and has attracted many foreign commercial firms to engage in business with it. The company hosted foreign guests yesterday, providing tea and refreshments. Many leaders from foreign banks, trust companies, and various industries attended. The company's managing director Zou Bingwen, general manager Cheng Lian, deputy general manager Gao Dajing, acting deputy general manager Chen Zhaoming, and assistant manager Ji Yizhong warmly received the guests and accompanied them on a tour of the various departments. The guests expressed their admiration for the company's thorough facilities, complete organization, and the fact that its directors and supervisors are well-known figures in the financial world. They expressed their deep respect and wished to maintain regular contact to benefit commerce.</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Rickshaw Guild General Meeting</h3>
<p>The Special District Office of the Rickshaw Guild of this city convened an emergency general meeting of all members yesterday afternoon at 2 PM. Over eighty people attended, including Gu Songmao, Hou Shaoan, Yin Zhiling, La Hegao, and Zhu Suiyuan. At 4 PM, the meeting was called to order, and Yin Zhiling was elected chairman. After the formalities, the chairman first reported on the situation of contacting the Public Works Department regarding the standard new rickshaw design. Next, the following motions were discussed: (1) The Public Rickshaw Management Office of the Public Works Department announced that from today onwards, any new rickshaws must conform to the standard new design. If the office does not approve, the rickshaw license will not be issued, causing the old-style rickshaw shells and parts that the rickshaw owners have prepared to be completely discarded and useless, amounting to bankruptcy. Regarding the method of responding to this situation, Gu Songmao reported that adding a black canopy with cloth lining, armrests on both sides of the seat, and using paint and cotton padding to the original rickshaw shell, if approved, would prevent the old-style rickshaw shells that the owners had prepared from being completely useless. It was resolved to have the board of directors draft a new rickshaw design and submit it to the Management Office for adoption, so that while respecting the solemnity of the Public Rickshaw Management Office's announcement, the interests of the rickshaw owners would not be harmed. (2) A motion to organize a cooperative to ensure uniformity in the painting of new rickshaws was passed. The board of directors was tasked with determining the specific methods. (3) Gu Songmao proposed that the Public Works Department had sixteen articles regarding rickshaw issues. Except for the first, second, and third articles, which were reserved, there were thirteen other articles. If these were all announced one by one in announcements, the rickshaw owners would be overwhelmed. A motion to send representatives to participate in the management office's coordination to facilitate progress was passed. The board of directors was instructed to send representatives to participate. (4) Regarding the special donations raised for relief, which were originally kept by Xu Liangbi, Hu Rongwang, Wang Kunyi, and Liu Shengwu, as Director Liu Shengwu has not attended meetings for a long time, a motion to nominate a replacement was passed. Zhu Suiyuan was nominated to jointly manage the funds. (5) Regarding the re-verification of registration certificates by this office, the board of directors decided to issue new certificates and nominated standing director Yin Zhiling, registration committee member Hou Shaoan, and review committee member Bao Guoxiang to be responsible for signing and stamping the certificates. A motion that the issuance of certificates should be subject to the retroactive approval of this general meeting was passed. Gu Songmao and Liang Ruiting were added as registration committee members. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM.</p>
<h3>"Manchukuo" Judged Under the Doctrine of the Catholic Church</h3>
<p>Newly Published by the Sacred Teaching Magazine</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Zhengxiang, former Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, now a Benedictine monk in Belgium, recently wrote an article in French entitled "Manchukuo Judged Under the Doctrine of the Catholic Church." The Sacred Teaching Magazine of Xujiahui has translated it into Chinese and published it as a separate booklet. It can be obtained from the magazine for a postage fee of three cents. Mr. Lu wrote this book to correct the European and American misunderstanding of China caused by the negative propaganda of Japan. He distributed the book to political circles in various countries, thereby correcting many misunderstandings. Furthermore, the Catholic doctrine described in the book is based on Cardinal Mercier of Belgium's remarks on the German army's occupation of Belgium during the European War, which deeply reflects the current situation of our country and is sufficient to warn the powers that are invading us.</p>
<h3>Li Jushi's Edited "Theory and Practice of Controlled Economy" - Fourteenth Volume of the New China Construction Society Series</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the New China Construction Society of Shanghai has been actively engaged in promoting academic research and national revival, making significant contributions to the country and society. However, it usually does not engage in ostentation, but seeks to establish a solid foundation, so the outside world is not very aware of its activities. However, the society's publications, such as the regularly published "Fuxing Monthly," have seen a sharp increase in sales due to their substantial content. In addition, the society has published a series of books, including (1) "A Collection of Japanese Views on Our Northeast," (2) "Military Aviation," (3) "The Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan," (4) "Xingguo Records (First Collection)," (5) "Historical Materials on the Constitution of the Republic of China," (6) "A History of International Intelligence," (7) "The World Economic Situation Since the European War," (8) "A Study of Electoral Systems in Various Countries," (9) "An Economic Survey of Chahar," (10) "Scientific Modern War Preparation," (11) "Educational Systems and Overview of Various Countries," (12) "Recent Northeast Economy and Japan," and (13) "Currency Policies and Currency Wars of Various Countries," for a total of thirteen kinds. Most of these have been welcomed and loved by the general public, with many reprints and third editions. Recently, a book entitled "Theory and Practice of Controlled Economy," edited by Li Jushi, was also published at the inauguration ceremony of the society's new headquarters (on the 27th). The content is extremely rich, including an introduction, the meaning of controlled economy, the development of controlled economy theory, the reasons for the rise of controlled economy, the goals of controlled economy, the content of controlled economy, and fifteen chapters on Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, England, the United States, France, Japan, Japan, "Manchukuo," and China. The entire book is over 300,000 words, printed in a 23-size format. The book selects new materials and uses concise language to provide a systematic and organized description of controlled economy. The introduction of theory is extremely accurate, and the explanation of the actual application in various countries is particularly comprehensive and concise. Since the concept of controlled economy has swept the globe, many Chinese people have sought to solve national problems through this path. However, although there is a vast amount of publications on this topic, there are not many that are relatively complete and substantial. Li Jushi's compilation fills this gap. The book is prefaced by Mr. Huang Fu, the current Chairman of the Beiping Political Consolidation Committee, Mr. Jin Guobao, a member of the Guangxi Economic Committee and Deputy Manager of the Shanghai Jiaotong Bank, Dr. Zhang Sumin, a professor at National Jinan University, Mr. Tang Qingzeng, Dean of the Business School of Daxia University and Editor-in-Chief of the Quarterly Journal of Economics of the Chinese Economic Society, and Mr. Dong Xiujia, Dean of the Business School of National Jinan University and former Director of the Jiangsu Construction Department, all of whom are contemporary scholars with a wealth of knowledge. They have all highly praised the book, and it has been carefully reviewed by economic expert Dr. Li Quanshi, demonstrating its value. Therefore, anyone who aspires to study controlled economy must read this book. It is also suitable as an economic reference book for universities and high schools. The price is 1.60 yuan per copy. It is sold at major bookstores nationwide, or you can contact the publishing department of the society at 656 Weihaiwei Road, Shanghai (telephone 95663). There are preferential terms for schools, institutions, and libraries nationwide.</p>

<h3>Remarkable Efficacy in Treating Insanity - Four Recently Cured and Discharged Patients, including Zhang Rongsheng</h3>
<p>Since its opening, the Shanghai Mental Hospital, located at Ren'an Lane, Guling Road, in this city, has achieved remarkable results. Recently cured and discharged patients include Zhang Rongsheng, 42 years old, who lived on Dongyouheng Road. He worked as a tea server on foreign ocean liners. Due to a specific stimulus, he suddenly became severely insane. He used to run wild on the streets and was sent to the hospital by the Laozha Patrol Room for treatment. After being hospitalized for more than a month, he was completely cured. There were also three other insane patients, Fan Li, Fan Huanbi, and Pu Zhongyu, who were admitted to the hospital one after another and were also cured and discharged at the same time.</p>
<h3>Mei Lanfang's Farewell Masterpiece</h3>
<p>This Sunday evening will be Mei Lanfang's last day before his departure. He will perform the complete "San Niang Teaches Her Son." This play only usually performs the "Jifang Teaches Her Son" scene. It is a Qingyi Erhuang drama, and mastering this aria is already difficult. Being able to perform the entire play is even rarer. The plot is delicate and tortuous, showcasing the full range of human emotions. Old plays of this kind are most easily exposed. Unless one has true skill, one would never dare to perform them lightly. Even after Mei Lanfang's more than ten visits to Shanghai, this is the first public performance. He wishes to reward his knowledgeable patrons with this farewell offering.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, I have checked the June 1st issue of your newspaper and found that it stated that Shen Zongquan, the Tenth District Party Headquarters executive committee member, and school groups, etc., organized a New Life Movement conference and held a grand parade the night before, which is inconsistent with the facts. After investigating, the district party headquarters promoted the New Life Movement and held an expanded publicity campaign on May 15th. The lantern parade was completely voluntary by various businesses. Moreover, Shen Zongquan was originally the captain of the security team and was not an executive committee member of the district party headquarters. I am corresponding to request that the newspaper make corrections. Sincerely, the editorial department of this port news of the Shen Bao, Wang Yonggong, Standing Committee Member of the Tenth District Party Headquarters, June 1st</p>
<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3>On "Humor"</h3>
<p>│││By Li Qiushi│││</p>
<p>What is the explanation of "humor"? Does humorous literature have a place in the literary field?</p>
<p>Lately, we have often seen letters from readers, like Mr. Li Qiushi, raising questions like these to us. Because they have discovered that many publications currently contain argumentative articles on humorous literature, it has aroused their interest in this question. At the same time, they feel the need for a thorough understanding. In order to meet the requirements of our readers, we cannot help but raise this question and give a simple and clear explanation.</p>
<p>What is called "humor"? "Humor" is originally a transliteration of the English word "Humor." Generally speaking, it contains two elements: satire and mockery. It is a form of mockery, but at the same time, it feels sorrow for the one being mocked; or, although it is laughable, it can evoke understanding and compassion. Therefore, mockery that does not contain satire or educational meaning cannot be counted as humor. When we see Charlie Chaplin's strange appearance, it is of course laughable, but what we cannot forget most is the strong satire that is set off from his appearance. When we see the clowns in old Chinese operas, they are sometimes funny, but what we should not ignore most is the invisible warning that it gives us. Without the essence of humor, everything about Charlie Chaplin and the clowns would only degenerate into slapstick and nonsense.</p>
<p>Some people regard humor as the key to self-preservation and self-cultivation, as a form of entertainment for themselves, so they believe that: not talking about the universe, but only talking about "flies" is humor. This is a misunderstanding, and it can even be said to be a defamation of humor. Of course, from "flies," it is not impossible to recognize the reality of society, but what we must remember is that talking about flies and talking about the universe are still exploring the truth and still reflecting one aspect of reality. Obviously, the question is not about talking about "flies" or talking about the universe, but about how to attach the meaning of education or satire to the mockery. What we are talking about is whether we have fulfilled the task of education or satire. Otherwise, learning to pretend to be Charlie Chaplin's "honorable appearance" is actually just a low-level fun. Some people also believe that "humor" is just a trick played by cowardly gentlemen. The general public does not need humor. If they want to laugh, they can laugh wildly. If they want to scold, they can scold loudly. They don't need any politeness. This is also an overly mechanical view. They treat the public as abstract and as a uniform thing, and ignore the various components of the public, which require various different types of education; they need to be enlightened from the expression of the correct world view and outlook on life. How can you say that the public does not need humor? For anyone, a direct satire and admonishment are most likely to cause disgust. Once there is disgust, its effectiveness will inevitably be reduced. If we express the content of satire in gentle laughter, then the listener will feel comfortable, and the influence they receive invisibly will definitely be deeper than direct satire. Humor is the best way to educate the public. It is a mirror that can point out various shortcomings and teach how to correct those shortcomings. Humor is not retreat, but still an attack, a side attack. The opinions of the two families above only see the appearance of humor and overlook the essence of humor.</p>
<p>Then, does it have a place in the field of literature? We can resolutely answer: yes, humor is the main component of comedy. In our era, tragedies that describe the pain of the era are of course necessary, but humorous comedies that educate the public have a more important meaning. We certainly do not deny that the humor that is currently being promoted does not contain this meaning at all, but we cannot deny the existence of humor because of this. Our main task is to restore humor from the perverted state of slapstick and nonsense to its original appearance and take on its actual task. We can repeat once more, humorous literature that educates the public is bound to exist!</p>

<h3>The Fifth China Middle School Sports Federation Games Opened Yesterday Two High Jumps from Shangzhong were Outstanding Surprising Upsets Final Broke Records Total of Five Items</h3>
<p>The track and field competition of the Fifth Middle School Games, organized by the Shanghai Secondary School Sports Federation, began at the China Track and Field Field at 2:00 PM yesterday. The men's 400 meters, 1,500 meters, discus, high jump, long jump, and women's high jump and javelin finals have been completed. The results have improved. Shangzhong pulled off a surprise upset and won the high jump and long jump championships, both breaking previous records, which is particularly rare. All events are expected to be completed today. The situation yesterday is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Venue Situation</h3>
<p>A strong wind suddenly rose yesterday, and gusts of flying sand and dust on the sports field were like a thick fog. The faces of people on the opposite side were unrecognizable. The athletes could not open their eyes, which inevitably affected the results of the track events. The conference opened at 2:00 PM without a ceremony. A temporary thatched shed was set up in the field as the general record office. The venue layout was quite simple, and the order was quite good due to strict management. Athletes from various schools were on the side of the field and set up their own camps as rest areas. There were quite a few spectators who bought tickets to come. Only the athletes in the field were seen to be energetic and focused on competing. The referees judged clearly and there were no disputes, which is indeed a gratifying phenomenon.</p>

<h3>(Track and Field Snippets)</h3>
<p>The men's 100 meters and 200 meters held semi-finals yesterday. Zeng Rongzhong of Jinan and Dong Yinchu of Guanghua both won their groups. Their results were similar. Today, the competition between these two tigers will be fierce. Zeng is known for his speed, while Huang is known for his explosive power. It's hard to say who will win. The men's 400 meters held no preliminary round yesterday due to the small number of participants. Zeng Rongzhong led from start to finish, ultimately winning first place with 53.6 seconds, breaking the highest record of 54.8 seconds held by Long Xueqiu.</p>
<p>30 people participated in the men's 1500 meters. Long-distance runner Wang Zhengling also participated in the competition. In the first lap, Lan Shijie of Fuzhong led, followed by Gu Xinbing of Daxia. Wang was in third place. After the second lap, Wang broke out into first place. Lan dropped out midway. Gu Binghou and Zhou Songxian were in second place. The order remained the same in the third lap. In the fourth lap, as they approached the finish line, Zhao Miaogen of Yuqing emerged from behind, finishing in second place, only ten meters behind Wang Zhengling.</p>
<p>The men's 400-meter relay was participated in by six schools: Shangzhong, Yuqing, Hujiang, Nanshang, Daxia, and Guanghua. Yuqing had the advantage in the first leg. After the second leg, Feng Yuqi of Hujiang sprinted desperately, ultimately winning first place by maintaining his effort until the finish line. Yuqing was second, Shangzhong was third, and Daxia was fourth, with a result of 48.54 seconds.</p>
<p>In the men's high jump and long jump, Shangzhong pulled off a surprise. Zhou Shilong broke the record of 1.69 meters held by Li Lin and Xie Jinhe in the high jump with 1.725 meters. Feng Wenchang broke the record of 6.206 meters held by Wang Jihua in the long jump with 6.605 meters. This was truly unexpected.</p>

<h3>Superfluous Remarks on the Closing of the Far Eastern Games - The National Games Can Use World Records as a Standard - Contacting Overseas Chinese Does Not Depend on the Existence of the Far Eastern Games</h3>
<p>(Special Correspondent Yan Wenchun from Manila for this Newspaper)</p>
<p>With the end of this sports meet, the field events, track events, all-around swimming, and four championship trophies were won by Japan. Tennis was postponed in the middle, and the Japanese athletes have already returned to their country, so it will be abandoned. The three championship trophies for basketball, baseball, and volleyball were won by the Philippines. The only championship trophy our country won was the football championship, which has been passed down from previous sessions. In terms of basketball and volleyball, our country's strength is not inferior to others, but we suffered many losses due to the disadvantage of being away. Baseball strength is not sufficient, so it is difficult to deny. There were very few participants in track and field, all-around, and swimming. There were only a few people, such as Wang Jihai, Zhang Lingjia, Chen Baoqiu, Fu Baolu, and Liu Changchun. Although Chen Baoqiu won second place in discus throw and Fu Baolu in pole vault, all the rest were completely defeated. On average, on the first day, Japanese athletes scored over 25 points, Philippine athletes scored over 16 points, and Chinese athletes only scored points. On average, on the second day, Japanese athletes scored over 36 points, Philippine athletes scored over 27 points, and Chinese athletes only scored six points. After the swimming preliminaries, they did not participate in the finals. The biggest reason is that the two sides had dozens of participants, and some broke previous records. For example, in the all-around event, only Wang Jihai from our country competed alone, and his score was also higher than before. From now on, regardless of whether the Far Eastern Games has come to an end, our country's athletes should actively train for the above-mentioned sports in order to have the opportunity to participate in the World Games.</p>
<p>Hao Chunde, the champion of five sports in our country's National Games, did not participate in the competition throughout the entire event. According to the announcement by the head coach, he was said to be unaccustomed to the climate and in poor health. It was also heard that when the 9th Far Eastern Games were held in Japan, Hao Chunde was unable to compete due to a sore hand. This is truly a case of "one hand cannot clap." Also, tennis left-hander Lin Wangsu, the tennis champion of the entire Malay Peninsula for many years, had defeated Qiu Feihai and slightly defeated Lin Baohua in Shanghai. In this Far Eastern Games, the Japanese tennis player Sato Taro defeated Qiu Feihai with 6-0, 6-4, and 6-0. Sato had played a match with Lin when he passed through Singapore on his way to Europe the year before, and Lin had defeated him 6-1. This time, with the status of an overseas Chinese, he overcame all obstacles and attended the Far Eastern Games to win glory for his motherland, but the team leader did not give him a chance to play, causing him to be frustrated and return empty-handed. This is truly a great pity.</p>
<p>After the conclusion of ticket sales for this Far Eastern Games, excluding complimentary tickets (for the staff of the organizing committee, members of the national delegations, and reporters from various newspapers), 126,681 people purchased tickets to enter and watch, with ticket sales revenue totaling over 107,000 yuan. Compared to the 7th edition held in Manila in 1925, which only brought in over 45,000 yuan, it can be seen that the public's interest in sports has progressed rapidly. It is estimated that over 60% of this 100,000 yuan was provided by overseas Chinese. Also, the participation of the Chinese Miss Mermaid Yang Xiuqiong, who is famous both inside and outside of China, in this women's swimming performance (Chinese Miss is an honorary title temporarily given by Filipinos) made Chinese, Philippine, and American men and women want to behold her elegance and demeanor. During the two days of performances, the audience increased by how many more than 10,000? And in this swimming pool, they were able to see the blue sky and white sun flag waving five times and hear the Chinese national anthem from the Philippine Constitutional Army music. Ms. Yang has truly won a lot of glory for China. Ms. Yang stayed in the Philippines for half a month and received 700 letters and over a thousand requests to sign her photos. One day, Ms. Yang went to the Chinese Photo Studio to take photos. Afterwards, two Filipino deaf-mutes used gestures to ask her to sign 25 photos. The lady smiled and granted their request. At a banquet at the Datong Club, two Filipino teenagers strongly wanted to buy public banquet tickets, saying they wanted to feast on the beauty of the female athletes, but were rejected by the businessmen who organized the banquet. It was heard that a middle-aged businessman from Hong Kong was also pursuing her. Ms. Yang's personal relationship is related to the honor of the sports world in our country. This is a big problem in the future and not just a matter of personal honor.</p>
<p>The Far Eastern Games were disbanded due to the collusion between Japan and the Philippines, which is a painful insult to our country. The Japanese side wanted to hide the truth from the world and legitimize their illegitimate child, while falsely claiming that sports have nothing to do with politics. The Philippine side also echoed this statement, saying that our country is too serious about the participation of the puppet state. However, our people in the Philippines also need to be understanding. I remember that before the round table conference opened in Shanghai in April, the Japanese Consul General in the Philippines boldly said that the Philippines is currently seeking independence and should not offend Japan, which is a disguised ultimatum. Since the American people in the Philippine newspaper published their unfair views on the martial law of this association, saying that the Philippines in 194 may become a continuation of Manchuria. A friend of the Filipinos in the political world privately asked, "Do you believe this statement?" He said that this situation is possible, but it will always be after the establishment of a new province. When we heard this, we had no time to mourn for others and were eager to mourn for ourselves.</p>
<p>The so-called sports can promote international relations, or perhaps that is just the rhetoric of the political and diplomatic circles. I do not know about other countries. If China is no matter, in the Philippines, every time there is a sports competition, the overseas Chinese and the local lower-middle class have another layer of resentment. Since the number of spectators on both sides is considerable, they are bound to cheer for the winners, and perhaps even make embarrassing ridicule. If one sentence cannot be tolerated, then a fight will break out. Moreover, athletes who do not abide by sports ethics often take the opportunity to injure people, and the witnesses and referees are not fair. Negotiations often arise, and these are all common occurrences. Therefore, the saying that sports can promote international relations seems to be true in theory but not in fact.</p>
<p>From now on, if our country wants to train and strengthen our physique, we can divide the country into five regions: east, west, south, north, and center, and conduct them in stages. Every year or every three years, a National Games should be held, and overseas Chinese from special regions and overseas such as the American, French, British, and Dutch regions and ports should be invited to join, using world sports records as the standard. This is also a way to connect with overseas Chinese and truly increase Chinese and foreign relations. It does not depend on the existence or non-existence of the Far Eastern Games.</p>
<h3>The Origins of the Jiangsu Education Department's Convention on Physical Education: Three Motivating Factors; Convention Will Last More Than One Day</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: The Jiangsu Education Department has scheduled a provincial school physical education conference to convene on the 5th of this month. In addition to the physical education teachers from each school, the principals are also required to attend. It is said that there are many proposals, and the conference will last more than one day. The provincial government has approved a budget of 1,000 yuan for the conference, indicating that it is different from ordinary meetings. According to what this reporter knows, there are three motivating factors for this conference that the provincial government has recently deemed important: (1) After returning to Jiangsu from an inspection of Japanese educational institutions, the delegation felt that the physical strength of Chinese students was far inferior to that of Japanese students. Physical strength is the mother of the spirit. Without citizens with sound physical constitutions, how can a sound nation be organized? Therefore, physical education in schools should be popularized throughout the entire school, and should not focus solely on a small number of athletic students. (2) The provincial government has recently launched a riding and archery association. The promoters are all important figures in the provincial government. More than 8,000 yuan in membership fees have already been collected. Construction on the archery range has already begun, and horses have been ordered and purchased in Beijing and Shanghai. This proves that the provincial government's promotion of archery and horsemanship aligns with the ancient Six Arts (rites, music, archery, horsemanship, writing, and arithmetic). In other words, it is also intended to cultivate a strong public interest in rites and education. (3) Chairman Chen convened all primary school students in the province on the 22nd of last month for a ceremony experiment on the sports field. On the first day, the Education Bureau conducted a rehearsal in advance. The weather was slightly warm, and the students, being physically weak, could not bear the heat. Many suffered heatstroke and collapsed. On the second day, there was even a rescue team on standby. The results of the experiment showed that, apart from a small number of schools where the ceremony was proper and the spirit was full, the vast majority were uncoordinated in their movements and looked down as they walked. What was even more strange was that the steps of the entire three thousand-plus children involved stomping their heels on the ground. The distance of each step could not be measured in inches, and the time for each step could not be measured in seconds. They were shaking their heads and hurting their brains. Primary schools have not yet been adequately developed; how can they withstand this? Many people believe that primary school teachers have too little common knowledge and experience in physical education. Fundamental correction should begin with improvements in secondary school physical education. Due to these various reasons, the physical education conference is of great importance. At that time, there will certainly be important proposals regarding the above points.</p>

<h3>Yunnan Education Director Gong Zizhi Discusses Promoting Education in Border Areas</h3>
<p>Yunnan Education Director Gong Zizhi arrived at the Ministry of Education on the 31st to meet with Vice Minister Duan and Director Gu to explain a plan to promote education in border areas. Afterwards, it was reported that the director intends to gradually complete education in border areas within six years in three stages. The initial plan is to establish five simple normal schools in various border areas of Yunnan to train teachers for promotion purposes. One will be established in Deqin (in the northwest corner of Yunnan, inhabited by Tibetans), focusing on Tibetan language instruction due to its environment. Second, one will be established in Mianning (in the southwest, inhabited by the Yi people), focusing on Lolo language instruction. Third, one will be established in Cheli (due south, inhabited by the Yi people and near Myanmar, Siam, and Annam), focusing on Burmese language instruction. Fourth, one will be established in Zhaotong (in the northeast corner, inhabited by ethnic minorities), focusing on Lolo language instruction. Fifth, one will be established in Qiubei (in the southeast, inhabited by the Miao and Yao people), focusing on Miao language instruction. In addition, in terms of public education, schools and social-style public education centers will be established, and itinerant lectures and educational films will be used as promotional tools. The initial plan is to establish one to two hundred public schools, with a total cost of approximately 40,000 yuan. Requests for subsidies have been made to Executive Yuan President Wang and educational circles, and it is decided to begin implementation in August after the summer break this year. Regardless of the extent of financial subsidies and provincial fundraising, at a minimum, the simple normal schools in Deqin, Mianning, and Cheli must be established, and public schools will also be established as much as possible, separately.</p>

<h3>Radio Silence Control Method</h3>
<p>— Yi Zhi</p>
<p>Recently, new American radios, in addition to using sensitive automatic volume controls, also have silence controls. Their function is to prevent a kind of noise from entering the antenna and being input into the speaker to cause annoyance before the radio receives an external signal.</p>
<p>The principle of the silence controller is to use the Class B amplification characteristics of a vacuum tube, that is, to make the grid receive a considerable negative voltage, so that the plate current is cut off, which is equal to zero. The low-frequency amplifier tube then loses its working effect, so even a slight noisy sound on the grid cannot be input into the speaker and make a sound. Now, let's give an example to explain it, please look at the diagram. VI is the automatic volume control tube, V2 is the silence adjustment tube (Silent tuning tube), V3 is the low-frequency strong amplification tube, R, R1, R2 are fixed load resistors. R3 is the volume control, R4 is the silence control. When the radio is turned on but has not received an external signal, the automatic volume control does not work, and the R load resistor has no voltage drop. Therefore, the control grid of the silence adjustment tube does not receive a negative voltage (R1 is an isolation load resistor and has no voltage drop), the plate current is very large, and the voltage drop of the R2 load resistor is also very large. Because of this, the grid of the low-frequency strong amplification tube receives a considerable negative voltage, the plate current is cut off here, and the speaker does not make a sound. But if an external signal comes, the automatic volume control immediately takes over the work, there is a negative voltage on the R load resistor, the grid of the silence adjustment tube receives this considerable negative voltage, and the plate current immediately decreases, and the voltage drop of the R2 load resistor also decreases. Since the negative voltage received by the grid of the low-frequency amplifier tube is small, the plate current will not be cut off, and it will perform its amplification work. On the one hand, after the external signal is rectified by the automatic volume control tube, a low-frequency voltage is generated on the R load resistor. After passing through the capacitor C1 to R3, the appropriate volume is adjusted and input into the low-frequency amplifier tube, amplified to the speaker, and the original signal is generated. As for the adjustment of the R4 silence controller, because the received signal has strong and weak, and the noise entering the antenna is also of different sizes, it must be tested and adjusted to the appropriate place.</p>
<h3>How to Improve a Radio: Adding an Adjustment Indicator</h3>
<p>— Yong Yan</p>
<p>On the panel of new radios, there is often a visible adjustment indicator (Visual tuning meter). This thing is to help with the adjustment, so that you can get the maximum volume and the clearest sound quality. The principle is also very simple, it uses an instrument that can indicate the strength of the current, the instrument is placed in a circuit that is related to the strength of the radio signal received. Usually a sensitive ammeter is used, connected to the plate circuit of one or more high-frequency amplification vacuum tubes. When this vacuum tube has not received a radio signal, the reading indicated by this ammeter is the plate current of this vacuum tube at the plate voltage used. However, when a radio signal is received, its plate current also changes accordingly: the greater the change in this plate current, the more legal the adjustment is. At this time, the pointer of the ammeter connected to the plate circuit will naturally move with the change in current. When we are adjusting, we only need to make the pointer of this indicating ammeter rotate to the maximum to get the maximum volume and the best tone.</p>
<p>If the adjustment of a heterodyne or automatic volume control radio is not correct, the sound quality is very poor, so an adjustment indicator is really necessary. If there is enough space on the panel of the radio to add an adjustment indicator, you can add it according to the attached diagram. You only need to break the plate circuit of the high-frequency amplification stage vacuum tube and add a direct current milliampere as shown in the figure. However, the current passing through this ammeter must not be greater than the maximum current that this ammeter can measure; at the same time, the positive and negative connections must not be confused, otherwise the pointer will point backwards.</p>
<h3>Talking Again About New Pocket Radios</h3>
<p>— Jian Cun</p>
<p>The previous issue of this journal (Issue 64) contained the new pocket radio published by Mr. Silian. Because the values of the required components were not specified in the diagram, and the principle of operation of the machine was not mentioned, readers have been writing to inquire recently. In addition to answering them separately, I will repeat the values of the required parts and the principle of operation in order to supplement the shortcomings of the previous article.</p>
<p>R7=1meg·n R8=1500n R9=2300n R10=330n C14=0、000 R1=1、5mcg、n R2=1mcg·n R3=0mcg·n R4=1、5mcg·n R5=1·5mcg·n R6=0·3mcg·n C5=0·02 C6=40uf C7=0·00、5uf C8=0、006uf C9=0、007uf C10=0、005uf C11 C12=8、5uf L1=3、4mh（40n）·L2=0、27mh（10n） L3 L4=0、28mh（3、5n） L5=5、3mh（un） C=C10 C2=0、00032mh C=0、00026 C=0、037mh</p>
<p>Circuit mode; The circuit used in this machine is shown in the first diagram, and the values of the parts used are also listed in the diagram. However, the one shown in the first diagram is slightly different from the one published by Mr. Silian, because the circuit used by Mr. Silian is applicable to explaining the principle, and this diagram is its actual circuit. There is nothing special about the circuit mode used, but two vacuum tubes are used as the function of a four-tube type, and the order of operation is radio frequency first stage, amplification, detection, and audio frequency second stage amplification. Now I will describe it in more detail below.</p>
<p>The antenna circuit uses C14 (fixed capacitor for antenna) and L1 (primary coil for antenna) for series tuning, but the capacitance of C14 is slightly larger, and a coil of about one turn is made from one end of L1 to intersect with the tuning circuit for radio frequency amplification.</p>
<p>Radio frequency amplification detection, audio frequency amplification and other functions are handled by one 6F7 tube. The radio frequency amplification tuning circuit is formed by C1 and L3, which is a complete and independent circuit, and is closely coupled with the L2 coil in the control grid circuit of the pentode part of the 6F7 tube, that is, L2 and L3 are wound on the same cylinder. The radio frequency amplified by the pentode part of the 6F7 tube passes through C6 and intersects with the grid of the triode part of the same tube. The tuning circuit is C2L4 and then C3R5 is used for grid detection. The audio frequency current after detection flows to the plate circuit of the triode part, and causes an audio frequency voltage at both ends of R3. The voltage passes through C4 and returns to the control grid of the pentode part to complete the audio frequency amplification and complete its reflex circuit. After that, the audio frequency voltage is supplied to the control grid of the pentode part of the 12A7 tube through ordinary load resistance coupling, and after being amplified by it, it is input to the speaker for operation.</p>
<p>The diode part in the 12A7 tube is used as a rectifier tube to perform the rectification function. The resistance R9 is used to replace the filter choke coil, and the capacitors C12 and C13 for filtering each use a value of 3uf.</p>
<p>The reason why this radio is different from other radios is that the 6F7 input circuit uses an inductive coupling method. This coil is made of a special wire. The center of the wire is a hard wire, and its surroundings have nine strands of mutually insulated stranded wire. The hard single wire in the center is used as the grid wire and connected to the tuning capacitor. The nine stranded wires on the outside are connected to the input grid of the vacuum tube. Also, because the machine strives for small size, the variable capacitor used is also manufactured differently from ordinary ones. The rest of the parts also try to avoid being bulky. The values of the parts are marked in the figure, so I won’t go into details here.</p>
<h3>Radio Using Two 33 Tubes</h3>
<p>— Zhu Ziyuan</p>
<p>Because there is no electricity in the interior, AC machines have never been popular. Except for a few research comrades who are experimenting with installation, it is simply one in a hundred. Therefore, DC machines can fill the interior, especially the power-saving type is the most popular. Therefore, 30, 31, 32, 33, and other vacuum tubes are the best-selling in my hometown, Songjiang.</p>
<p>The combination of one 30 detection and two 30 low-frequency amplifications has gradually been eliminated. Recently, the combination of one 30 detection and one 33 strong low-frequency amplification has become very popular. The reason is that the start-up cost is simple, the location is economical, and the volume is better than two 30 low-frequency amplifications, so everyone is happy to install it. However, since the 33 detection single-tube horn circuit was published in the newspaper, everyone has abandoned the old and welcomed the new for installation. The author is also one of the testers, but the test results show that in Songjiang, it is good to receive Shanghai's 100-watt stations, but the volume of small power stations is insufficient, and the effect is not as good as one 30 detection and 33 strong low-frequency amplification. So I added a stage of strong low-frequency amplification using 33, and successfully created a radio with two 33 tubes. The result was amazing. Its loudness is far beyond what 30 detection and 33 low-frequency amplification can achieve. I once took it to the noisy city and put the speaker at the door of a relative's store. It could be heard from more than a dozen storefronts away. Its loudness is comparable to that of a five-tube AC machine. Now more people are installing it. The author has installed two pairs for relatives, and Comrade Cai has also installed several for others. The effects are all very good and have never failed, so I dare to introduce it in this journal. Please come and try it out, fellow enthusiasts.</p>
<p>As shown in the figure, it is a stage of regenerative detection, plus a stage of low-frequency amplification, and there is nothing special about it. The capacitance of the parts are marked in the figure, and readers can refer to it. What should be noted is the C voltage problem, because after the high-power output here, there is another stage of high-power transformer-coupled low-frequency amplification, so it is very easy to cause distortion. The C voltage must be adjusted very carefully in order to get good results. Here, 135V is just an approximate number. Readers need to add more or subtract more to try to get the strongest volume without distortion.</p>
<p>Because this machine uses transformer-coupled low-frequency amplification, the sound is very loud, but the chance of distortion is also relatively high, so here we attach great importance to the C voltage. Please do not ignore it, readers. I think if you use resistance-coupled low-frequency amplification, although the volume will be reduced, the chance of distortion may be eliminated. If you have time, you may also try it!</p>
<h3>Wireless Radio Tidbits</h3>
<p>— Zhifan</p>
<p>Regarding the phenomenon of shortwave skip distance, according to a veteran in the wireless radio field, this phenomenon does not exist within our country. A shortwave transmitter of 15 watts or more can communicate unimpeded throughout the nation. The reason for this is probably due to our country's climate having extremely high humidity.</p>
<p>Overseas communication is often superior to landline communication. However, submarines can only communicate with long waves when they are 60 feet below the surface, and cannot communicate at all below 100 feet. The reason for this has yet to be satisfactorily explained.</p>
<p>The dry battery type 32 vacuum tube is a screen grid type power amplifier and detector tube. Its operational performance is highly inconsistent. Therefore, special attention must be paid to the voltage of its screen grid during application. Experiment with various voltages (from 22.5 to 67 volts) to find the most suitable value. Relying on what is said in books or magazines will unlikely yield good results. When used as a detector in a typical regenerative circuit, this vacuum tube is not as effective as the type 34. Gentlemen, you may wish to try it out.</p>
<p>The 245 vacuum tube is a newly released power amplification tube. Based on my personal testing, I find that its effectiveness is not significantly better than the type 47, and it is quite prone to damage. The B voltage is typically 250 volts, but I have changed it to 220 volts. The volume is not reduced, and it should be more durable.</p>
<p>Imported radios are subject to price reductions due to competition in the market and to cater to the psychology of the Chinese people. As a result, the quality is inevitably lowered. China's climate is relatively humid, especially during the yellow plum season. The insulation of transformers, filter capacitors, carbon resistors, etc., inside the machine also decreases, leading to damage. This often results in the machine's components, such as vacuum tubes, being burnt out, resulting in a loss that cannot be recovered. Even if it is not damaged, there will be excessive noise, and the radio reception will deteriorate drastically. This serves as a warning to those who are greedy for cheap goods!</p>
<p>Last month, the import of substandard wireless radio components reached 1.5 million yuan. Those who heard this were shocked. Examining the contents, spare parts accounted for the majority. Amateur enthusiasts who hear this should be deeply vigilant!</p>

<h3>Records of Lingering Fragrance</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Only when the Empress Dowager casually had a whim and suddenly wanted to listen to music, these musicians would have to immediately start playing. This was still considered a temporary impulse. Normally, there were also several rigid, fixed performances, like a set of formulaic articles. For example, when the Empress Dowager was on the road, every time she got into or out of the car, music was indispensable; moreover when the Empress Dowager traveled within the Forbidden City in a palanquin, no matter how frequent the moves were, the band had to play whenever she boarded the palanquin. The music would only stop when she issued the order to depart and the palanquin began to move. As soon as the music stopped, these musicians had to quickly pack up their instruments, being careful not to make loud noises. They would hurriedly take a different route to get ahead of her, waiting at her destination. As soon as she arrived, they would start playing again to welcome her. Because these people were afraid of causing a delay, they often hurried very quickly, but the speed of the Empress Dowager's palanquin on the road was as slow as a turtle's pace, so they never failed to arrive in time. And this situation looked especially like an ordinary family's funeral procession!</p>
<p>The band consisted of twelve people, all eunuchs of course. They all wore a conical hat, but their hats had a red tassel, unlike the ones worn by the eunuchs carrying the palanquin. Their clothing was virtually identical. They all wore a waistcoat that was peach-colored, but without any embroidery. Their robes were purplish-red, appearing exceptionally bright. Traditionally, each of them had an assistant, not out of thoughtless extravagance, but because they were so busy that without an assistant, they couldn't manage everything themselves. (47)</p>
<h3>Love Letter</h3>
<p>— Ziyun</p>
<p>I have a colleague who recently received a letter. The name and address on the envelope were completely correct, but when he opened it, he was dumbfounded, because the letter was a love letter written to a woman. The gist of the letter was: "Since we parted, I have been missing you terribly, and I dream of you almost every night. Yesterday, I arranged to meet you at the ×× Theater, and I waited for two hours, but you didn't show up. Why are you so heartless? If I don't receive a reply within 24 hours of receiving this letter, I will prepare to jump into the Huangpu River." My colleague determined from the signature that a friend had mistakenly put the letter in the wrong envelope, causing this ridiculous situation. So he immediately wrote a reply, pretending to be the woman, and arranged to meet him at the Bund. Who knew that another letter would arrive the next day, this time asking to borrow money. This friend was truly extremely careless, mixing up the love letter with the letter asking to borrow money.</p>
<p>In the past, I had a friend who once wrote two letters: one was a love letter to his girlfriend, and the other was a letter to his parents at home. Unfortunately, in a moment of confusion, he put them in the wrong envelopes, sending the love letter to his parents and the family letter to his girlfriend. For a while, it became a source of amusement among his friends. What he didn't realize was that both of these letters were related to the issue of marriage. His father, seeing that he already had a girlfriend, stopped trying to find a spouse for him in his hometown, and his girlfriend, seeing that he was opposed to his parents making decisions for him, readily agreed to get engaged to him. So my friend actually benefited from his mistake. But his carelessness was similar to that of my colleague's friend.</p>
<h3>Brief Notes on Huizhou Inksticks</h3>
<p>— Dakua</p>
<p>My hometown has beautiful mountains and rivers, and famous figures have emerged in every era; moreover, it is also known for the Four Treasures of the Study (Chengxin Tang paper, Wang Boxuan brushes, Li Tinggui ink, and Old Pit stone inkstones). I love to collect old stories, and I will briefly record some notes on Huizhou inksticks:</p>
<p>Li Tinggui. From Yishui in the late Tang Dynasty, his original surname was Xi. To escape persecution, he followed his father (Li Chao) across the river to Shezhou. Because She County had many pine trees, the Li family became famous for their ink. The ink with the inscription "Gui" was the best, followed by "Gui," then "Gui," and the worst was "Xi Tinggui." It is also said that the ink with a double-ridged dragon pattern is excellent, while the single-ridged one is inferior. The best is the famous "Jianchun Round Cake," which does not decay even after being submerged in water for a month. The dragon pattern on the ink can also cut water.</p>
<p>Wu Zi, from Wuyuan in the Northern Song Dynasty, was good at making ink. The Wuyuan Chronicle records that Wu Zi's tomb is located in Huanggang Mountain in the east of the county, with a stele recording his ink-making activities.</p>
<p>Dai Yanheng, from Wuyuan in the Southern Song Dynasty, was recommended in the eighth year of the Shaoxing reign of Emperor Gaozong for making Fugu Dian ink and other inks. He also had ink names such as "Bi Gui" and "Wu Yu" that were passed down through the generations.</p>
<p>Wu Quchen, from Xiuning Shangshan in the Ming Dynasty, imitated the Yishui ink-making method and deeply understood its essence. He had an arrogant nature, and when he encountered scholars, he would generously give them ink, not being stingy at all. But if he encountered officials or wealthy merchants who wanted to exchange money for ink, he would turn a blind eye. His ink also had strange names, such as "Unmilled" and "Unprecedented." His nephew, Wu Mingwang, was also good at this, with the ink name "Zijin Shuang," known as the Two Wus. Fang Yulu, from Wuyuan in the Ming Dynasty, was good at making oxtongue ink. The best one was called "Qinglin Sui," and he wrote a book on ink recipes that was passed down through the generations.</p>
<p>Cheng Junfang, from Wuyuan in the Ming Dynasty, was a contemporary of Fang Yulu and also wrote a book on ink recipes. His ink making emphasized light glue, suitable for the south but not for the north. Because the north is dry, light glue cannot withstand the wind, and it is easy to break. His ink had names such as "Xuan Yuan Ling Qi."</p>
<p>Wang Dezi, from She County in the Ming Dynasty, made ink called "Yu Jie Chi," which was of extremely high quality, almost surpassing Cheng's ink. Unfortunately, he did not cherish it, and after his death, it was completely lost.</p>
<h3>Low Pressure</h3>
<h3>The Art of Cursing</h3>
<p>— Zuichisheng</p>
<p>There is a saying in Shanghai: "I'd rather listen to Suzhou people curse than Ningbo people talk." This shows that when it comes to the art of cursing, the Suzhou people, who are known for their "soft Wu dialect," are the most skilled. A Mr. Guanqin once wrote a joke in a newspaper about "sugar Buddha's hands." He said: The boatmen of Suzhou are the most skilled at cursing, often using terms that people don't understand. A friend of his was urinating by the river when some of his urine splashed on the stern of a boatman's boat. The boat woman saw this and cursed, "倷格隻是糖佛手㖸 (Nong ge zhi si tang fo shou a)." The friend was still baffled. Later, someone told him that she was cursing him as "堂弗收 (tang fu shou)," meaning "not to be collected in the hall," because in the past, after serious criminals were executed, their bodies had to be exposed for several days, and the charity halls would not collect them. Such is the depth of their curses. In my opinion, the next best are the people who work in brothels. I have a friend who likes to go to brothels with others, but he never wants to spend any money. Therefore, the madam often says he is "墳墩頭浪格新官人 (fen dun tou lang ge xin guan ren)," meaning "a new official on the grave mound." People hear this and don't quite understand. Later, everyone guessed that it meant he was "想發懨，死要出風頭 (xiang fa yan, si yao chu feng tou)," meaning "desperate to show off." And when they see "木林式 (mu lin shi)" customers, they call them "屋頂頭浪格菩薩 (wu ding tou lang ge pu sa)," meaning "a bodhisattva on the roof." It sounds like a respectful term, but it actually means you are "瓦老爺 (wa lao ye)," meaning "a tiled lord." This kind of "riddle-like" art of cursing is truly remarkably clever!</p>
<h3>Four Company Commanders of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twenty-Nine</p>
<p>Returning the Letter, He Grieved and Declared His Loneliness</p>
<p>Listening to the Oath, They Shared Blood and Vowed Loyalty</p>
<p>Zi Qiang blushed and said, "How can I not go forward? I can always distinguish between public and private matters. How can I still be thinking of my family at this critical time? It's just…" He only said these two words and then stopped. Although he had stopped, Yin Deren, who was standing in front of him, knew that he couldn't go on. It would be even more difficult for him if he were to ask him about it, so he didn't say anything more. Not only was Yin Deren clear about it in his heart, but Battalion Commander Bao Fang, who was taking a walk outside to relieve the pent-up frustration in his chest, also overheard these words from across the corner. He thought to himself, if Zhao Ziqiang can't forget his love for his children, how can this battle be fought! Thinking to himself, his feet moved him along and he unconsciously walked to Tian Qing's company headquarters. There was a hole in the wall here, covered with paper to serve as a window. He looked inside and saw Tian Qing lying straight on the kang with his legs crossed, holding a photograph in his hand. It was impossible to know who was in the photograph, but after seeing him look at it, he kissed the photograph twice on the face, clearly an act of affection towards a woman. In his heart, he felt that this kind of action was even more advanced than Zhao Ziqiang's behavior. So he turned around and walked away with his hands behind his back. He walked to the end of the road and was blocked by a wall. Only then did he suddenly raise his head. As he raised his head, he heard the sound of drums in front of him. Looking, he saw two young buglers standing in the sunlight, practicing playing the drums. One hung the drum in front of his chest and beat it with drumsticks. The other tapped his feet and sang the tune of the bugle in his mouth. Just watching him swing his hands with such vigor, he had forgotten everything. Bao Fang watched for a long time. Suddenly, he turned his head and saw that the battalion commander had saluted and stood at attention. Bao Fang laughed and said, "Good boy, you're doing well. We're about to go into battle. Cheer up a bit." The bugler said, "What's the hurry? If I'm meant to die, I won't live. If I'm meant to live, I won't die." (398)</p>
<h3>Reminiscences of Watching Lanterns</h3>
<p>— Kedingan</p>
<p>In the late spring of the twenty-third year, I felt unwell, to the point of being powerless. Later, I didn't even want to eat, so I got a few days of sick leave and returned to Xinshi to recuperate. It happened that at that time, from the 30th to the 11th, many people in Xinshi were busy with the "New Life Movement Lantern Festival." Speaking of lantern festivals, the nearby places of Liuhe, Taicang, Shatou, Hengjing, Luodian, Nanxiang, Loutang, Jiaxing, and Xiashi all had their own grand occasions and their own advantages. Our Xinshi's lantern festival has always been famous. The lanterns in other places mainly use paper and are made by hand. Xinshi's lanterns are different. Their main material is Mingjing stone (also known as Thousand-Layer Paper, a mineral), which is carefully peeled open layer by layer and laid flat, then slowly ironed smooth with an iron. Then, it is carefully made into various fitting patterns with colored paper cutouts. Therefore, people with discerning eyes say that Xinshi's lanterns are more exquisite than those in other places. The most recent one was sixteen years ago, and then again thirteen years ago. At that time, I was still young and didn't have a very deep impression. There hadn't been one since. This year, the New Life Movement is popular, and the people of Xinshi didn't want to be left behind. The branches of the community raised money and each contributed ingenious works. Two months ago, they began to prepare. It is said that some of the valuable masterpieces had cost three or four thousand man-days of labor, and the least had taken dozens of man-days. Even the light and portable small works that can be held in the hand had taken twenty or thirty man-days to complete. From this, you can know the value of Xinshi's "lanterns."</p>
<p>I was sick and had no energy, but on the night of the first lantern festival on March 10th, I watched them to my heart's content. The opening exhibits included the New Life Movement slogan lantern from the Xinshi Public Education Center, the large incense burner from Hongfu Community (as large as the large burner in the Shanghai City God Temple), and the large Treasure Bowl, all made of Mingjing stone. The belly of the burner and the bowl were sixty inches in diameter. You can imagine how much work it took to make them with small pieces of Mingjing stone. The hexagonal pavilion from Changgeng Community, Carp Jumping Over the Dragon Gate, were also very meaningful works. Inside the pavilion was a movable mechanism of Guo Ziyi, which gave people a sense of "wealth makes people think of desires" when it moved. The carp jumping over the dragon gate jumped and jumped as if it were real. Their outer frames and all the small lanterns were all made of ironed Mingjing stone, which was very exquisite. Yongqian Community and Yong'an Community each made a large dragon boat with many figures inside, all of which could rotate. The dragon's eyes flashed, making it look majestic and terrifying. The Milky Way Bridge of Baoning Community performed the legend of the Cowherd and Weaver Girl. The Tumbling Pole Lantern was first tied to a very high bamboo frame with grids (about three rows, each with eleven grids), and each grid was hung with a different kind of lantern. The thirty-three different kinds of lanterns, all lit up and erected, were really beautiful. The silk factory of the Cooperative Community and the oil press of the Barber Community had similar mechanical movements. The Guanghan Palace of Ninghe Community was said to have taken more than three thousand man-days to complete, and its exquisite degree could set it apart. The Fengyi Pavilion and Game Pavilion of Wan'an Community each had their own merits. The Mirage of Baoan Community had its own unique insight and was extremely novel. The large lion of the Lion Dance Community was so large that it almost had to walk sideways on the narrow streets of Xinshi. Other items such as large umbrellas, small umbrellas, large and small flower baskets, etc., were produced by various communities. Especially the umbrellas, their circumference was made of colored paper cut into hexagonal or octagonal shapes, with two or three sections. The colored paper was pricked with matching landscapes, figures, insects, fish, birds, beasts, and ancient patterns with small needles. When reflected in front of the lanterns, one could see the exquisite needlework of the people of Xinshi. There were also many other fascinating lanterns that took a lot of effort to complete, but I cannot list them all.</p>
<p>At the head of each community, there was a silk and bamboo band or drum band to add to the fun. (The silk and bamboo music of the people of Xinshi was originally very good, and this time it was even better.)</p>
<p>This time, the number of spectators from the Shanghai-Hangzhou National Highway, the Jiaxing-Suzhou Waterway, and the surrounding towns and villages was no less than tens of thousands, which can be said to be an unprecedented grand occasion. Restaurants and snack shops had a booming business, but after the lantern market, the streets were still deserted. However, then again, at this time when sericulture is busy, the villagers naturally cannot come out and stroll in the streets. This is just a time of desolation! It is hoped that the farmers across the country will get some comfort this year, so that the rural economy can improve slightly!</p>

<h3>How Should We Say It?</h3>
<p>— Baige</p>
<p>Things always become clearer when they are discussed, and principles always become clearer when they are debated. These should be two very straightforward sentences. However, the current situation is different: Many things are clearer when they are not discussed, and become more confusing when they are discussed; they are clear when they are not debated, and become more chaotic when they are debated.</p>
<p>Why is this so?</p>
<p>This, of course, may be because the things themselves are not easily understood. Things are of all kinds, and principles can be argued in many ways. If we consider the vastness of the universe, which contains all things and principles, the universe itself is constantly changing and full of contradictions. Therefore, many things and principles have to be made more confusing and chaotic by people who each have a fixed position for certain reasons.</p>
<p>However, the source of this confusion and chaos lies precisely in the people who each have a fixed position. Although things are of all kinds, they always have a form, and each has its own form; although principles can be argued in many ways, they must be argued logically, and there are not many ways to argue. Even considering the universe, which is constantly changing and full of contradictions, that change and contradiction is the law upon which it depends for its existence. As long as it is not deliberately confused and distorted by people who each have a fixed position for certain interests, its true nature is very clear and easy to understand.</p>
<p>However, much confusion and chaos always arises from a deliberate confusion and distortion.</p>
<p>For example, in our intelligent literary world, there is still a mode of debate like this: If you say that someone is not good, they will say that you hate humanity and turn all of humanity against you; if you say that a certain essay is not good, they will say that you deny the existence of all essays and lightly place the crime of destroying culture on your head. Some people even extend the meaning and say that your opposition to essays is entirely due to "always feeling that small things are not pleasing to the eye."</p>
<p>In fact, this idea has the greatest mistake. A very clear counter-evidence is that those who attack essays, the guys who attack essays, are also essays, just a different kind. As for the so-called small things not being valued by the Chinese, that is not the whole truth: Which is more valued, "Miss" or "Elder Sister"? Are not the short Japanese rampaging in China, with even the powerful unable to do anything? Are not the tall Indians being mocked by us as Ah San? It can be seen that the words should be said differently.</p>
<p>So, how should we say it?</p>
<h3>Doing One's Best</h3>
<p>— Zhi Li</p>
<p>"Looking at differences, if you magnify what is large, then nothing is not large; if you diminish what is small, then nothing is not small. Knowing that heaven and earth are not grains of rice, and knowing that a fine hair can become a hill, then differences are apparent."</p>
<p>Although this kind of argument seems close to esoteric, it is actually the truth. Looking at the facts, the loss of the four northeastern provinces and the urgent war preparations of the great powers should be major events for the country and the world, but in the minds of most people, they have not regarded these as important. What they regard as important are flies, crickets, and the like. There are even many people who do not believe in the existence of those major events, only believing that the trivial matters related to themselves are real. This also confirms the following words: "Looking at merits, if you emphasize what is present, then nothing is not present; if you ignore what is absent, then nothing is not absent." If one's view of things is like this, how can writing be any different? There is an article in "Sanxian Ji" (Leisurely Essays) saying that in a certain environment, the author experienced a "world-weariness"-like sorrow in his heart, but it disappeared as soon as he was bitten by a mosquito. So he said: "Although it is only a mosquito bite, it is always something that happens to oneself that is more real. If I can avoid writing, I will naturally be happier. If I must write, I think I can only write about these kinds of small things, and I still cannot write them as clearly and deeply as I experienced them that day. Moreover, thousands of bites, let alone knives and guns, cannot be written."</p>
<p>The reason why short essays have flourished recently is also the result of the narrow scope of consciousness of the authors, which is unavoidable. However, it is different from writing the Eight-Legged Essay (a type of essay required in the imperial examination). The Eight-Legged Essay is a great essay discussing the Way of sages, and its subject matter is "cutting out several small pieces from the Confucian classics." Its thoughts cannot go beyond the classics, and are not the author's own. This is truly the act of "binding people's hearts and suppressing thoughts." The current writing of short essays is not necessarily the same. If one insists that the current short essay is equal to the Eight-Legged Essay, then that Eight-Legged Essay is definitely not the kind used for "testing scholars," but another kind. Behind the stone-printed "Romance of the Western Chamber" circulating in the market, there are often attached sixteen Eight-Legged Essays by Tang Yin, which take a line of lyrics from each act of "Romance of the Western Chamber" as the topic. This is somewhat similar to a certain type of short essay today, but is still much more constrained in form.</p>
<p>In ancient times, in addition to the Eight-Legged Essay, there was also the "Policy Question" (策問), also called "Responding to Policies" (對策), for "testing scholars." The questions and answers were about major political and economic issues, so they were also great essays. However, few of these great essays were good. Why? Without practical investigation and research, the basis for answering the policies was only a few Confucian classics, histories, philosophical works, and literary collections. Therefore, although the framework was large, the content was still empty.</p>
<p>Nothing can be generalized. It is good to do big topics, but it is not necessarily a waste of effort to do small topics. Mount Tai does not reject soil, and rivers and seas do not reject small streams. Small things may be helpful to big things, or at least they can coexist without hindrance. Most people in the world are limited by their talents and abilities, and some people can only do small businesses and small topics. If there are great talents who look down on these, they can go and do great undertakings and big topics themselves. At that time, with "big and small thriving," society will be much more lively and culture will progress faster.</p>
<p>Looking at China today, there is basically nothing. No matter what kind of undertaking, it will be criticized by grand discussions at the beginning and end in destruction, while those who make grand discussions do not do great undertakings themselves. This phenomenon is not good. I believe that the most important thing to do today is to "do one's best."</p>

<h3>"Weishui Xuan Diary" (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Shu</p>
<p>Four</p>
<p>In "Weishui Xuan Diary," there are three main travelogues that can be extracted: "A Journey to Qiyun Mountain," "A Journey to Baiyue Mountain," and "A Record of Wulin." These three records can represent the travelogues in the diary. Fragmentarily speaking, as "Record of Qiyun Mountain" says, "All day long walking between two mountains, one peak spitting clouds, one peak sending the sun, wild pine trees along the road, steamed by rain and baked by the sun, the fragrance assaulted the senses, and the sleeves were stained, and when twisted, they all had the aroma of dragon musk." As in "The weather is newly clear, and it feels even more clear and bright. The peaks have a clear morning color, dragging blue sunlight on them, the distant ones like vermilion flags in mid-air, the near ones like gilded and embroidered, with red maples and green cypresses dotted in between, ten thousand valleys storing clouds, and a thousand streams washing jade. At this point, I think that Li Zhaodao, the prince, did not set up all the rules for nothing. The size of the Mi school is like the Zhongshu Hall (Secretariat), with light ink as the judge's signature, and it is comprehensive." The description of the changing scenery is extremely vivid, and the writing is also very clear. "Record of Paying Homage to Baiyue Mountain" mostly records distances, personnel, meetings with friends, and visits to calligraphy and paintings, without special characteristics, except for "Hang Travel," which is short and eloquent. The book describes many times of traveling to Hangzhou, but only this trip is better. On the tenth day of the seventh month of Yimao, it says: "It was very hot. In the evening, Tan Mengxun prepared a small boat with wine and fruits to take me and my son for a cruise, starting from the lotus flower house, deep in the lotus leaves, going upstream to the inner six bridges, out to the three bridges, and arriving at the Lakeside Pavilion. We sat in a circle on the stone platform. At that time, the bright moon gradually appeared, and a refreshing breeze came suddenly, washing away the vexing heat. On the way back, we talked about poetry with great interest, pointing out the old residence of Sun Taichu, and sighing for it!" On the fifteenth day, it said, "Looking north from Su Causeway, the lights floating on the water are like gold, glittering and sparkling. The people of Hangzhou who are too poor to bury their dead throw their bones into the water of the Broken Bridge, and the custom of the Ghost Festival is such that the men and women of the city go boating on the lake at night, and all the boats, big and small, are rented out until dawn. However, only the northeast half is like boiling water. As for Hunan, there is a silent moonlit scene, illuminating a few groups of tap dancers. On the way back, we stayed for a while at Yuhuwawan. Mengxun pointed to a dilapidated house in the misty trees and said, 'This is where Tang Hanfu of Jinhua lived, closing the door all day to refine golden elixir. I don't know if he succeeded? We agreed to visit him in a while.'" The description of the scenery of the lake, the customs of the people, and the beauty of the night tour is no less touching than "Dreaming of Seeking." It is a pity that such descriptions are rarely seen in Li Rihua's diary.</p>
<p>Five</p>
<p>There is a special charm to Li Rihua's diary that I cannot help but mention again, and that is the part about writing about the weather, or the simple one or two lines of daily records, which are sometimes extremely inspiring. For example, writing about the sound of birds, "On the eighth day, it was sometimes rainy and sometimes sunny, and the weather was excellent, and the sound of birds was like the voice of Buddha." "Ninth day. In the dense green shade of the trees, there was a slight drizzle from time to time. The sunlight flashed through the clouds. I sat idly in the beautiful Yinyin Pavilion, listening to the sound of birds, which was extremely clear and pleasant." "Eighth day. The fine rain steamed and was humid, and the lacquered utensils were all sweating, and the sound of birds did not stop." What is recorded is only a dozen words, but a kind of leisurely life and poetic interest is revealed behind the paper. Also, as in, "Twenty-first day. The plum blossoms are already scattered, and shepherd's purse can be picked, and from now on, spring will be approaching day by day." "Third day. Cheng Kefan sent a blackbird as a gift, and the marriage family Zhang sent a pot of lilies, with thirty-six flowers budding and blooming, and from then on, I spent all day among the fragrance of flowers and the songs of birds." Both the artistic conception and the text can be deeply savored. However, no matter how much you try to escape the world, due to the connections of life, it is impossible in reality. Although Li Rihua did not worry about food, clothing, and housing, he was still inevitably filled with indignation about the world. When talking about people and affairs, he could not help but "sigh and lament." On another day, he said at length, "In recent days, I have been mediating disputes for people, and I feel that in this world, those who rely on their own opinions act arbitrarily, and those who are contrary to others will inevitably kick and bump. The waves are dangerous and terrifying. I now know that the ancients' retreat and concession are truly a cup of sweet dew in great vexation. Shen Zigang came and we drank wine while eating crab. Talking about this made it even more flavorful." This not only shows his indignation and why his life went into seclusion, but also can be inferred. (The End)</p>
<h3>Leaping the Ladder (5)</h3>
<p>— Cao Ming</p>
<p>At night, A-Han, half asleep, his body ruined by fatigue, pressed coarsely and heavily on the weak woman, and the woman cried out softly because she could not breathe comfortably:</p>
<p>"Be careful, I haven't had my period for three months, don't..."</p>
<p>"Really?" The man was filled with joy, and his body contracted because he was overly careful.</p>
<p>The sun was already leaning to the west, and the light shone from behind the small thatched hut beside the field, casting a gray, irregular square shadow in front of the door of the hut; an old woman and a young man with tanned skin were squatting in this shadow.</p>
<p>"It must be like this," the old woman said, rolling a paper cigarette with her head lowered, "I heard that Master Deng's father was also a poor bachelor, and when his mother was pregnant with him丨丨you know she was very pious哪丨丨she leaped the ladder on the nineteenth day of the ninth month, 'Guanyin's Birthday'……… You…</p>
<p>Look how wealthy and capable Master Deng is now!" The old woman stared at the rice fields with hopeful eyes.</p>
<p>"Leap the ladder, call our A-Mei leap the ladder? 丨丨" The man said hesitantly, smacking his lips.</p>
<p>"Forget it, forget it, sensible women often don't care about these things. Third Aunt and Fourth Niang both say that I have a good idea... We can't let poverty entangle our descendants. The next generation is important!" The old woman said forcefully and quickly. As a result, she went back with a triumphant smile.</p>
<p>On the nineteenth day of the sixth month, a solemn and expectant commotion arose outside A-Han's house. Two or three women dressed neatly, with slightly anxious faces, poked half their bodies in and asked carefully:</p>
<p>"Is everything all set up, Fourth Aunt?"</p>
<p>"Well, yes, you first move the fruit box and incense candles to the temple, A-Han..." the old woman said hurriedly, jumping like a grasshopper.</p>
<p>"Drink this sip of holy water," the mother-in-law held a bowl of clear water that had been left over from the "Seventh Sister Festival" last year, and said gently to her daughter-in-law, "After you drink it, I will go with you to worship Guanyin Niangniang, and leap the ladder in front of her altar, and you will definitely give birth to a blessed son..."</p>
<p>A-Mei followed her mother-in-law to the Guanyin Temple in a daze. The encouraging and respectful gazes of the people surrounding the temple door confused A-Mei. She mechanically listened to her mother-in-law's commands and knelt and worshiped without missing a beat.</p>
<p>In an open space in front of the altar of the Guanyin Temple, two square fir tables were placed, with a wooden ladder, the kind normally used to ascend to a god's altar, sandwiched in between. A bamboo ladder was then tied to it with straw rope, standing strangely and arrogantly in the joint of the two square tables, like a man-eating, long-legged demon. Many people held up the tables. A low wooden stool was also placed beside the square table.</p>
<p>A "god worshiper" prostrated herself on the open space and prayed, then stood up and walked devoutly to the pregnant woman standing there in a daze, saying:</p>
<p>"Sister-in-law Han, step on the low stool, climb onto the table on the right, and then climb up one step at a time, cross over the last step, and climb down from the left step by step," the old devotee continued with special effort, "Tell the Greatly Compassionate and Greatly Merciful, give birth to a wealthy and intelligent son, tell the Greatly Compassionate and Greatly Merciful!"</p>
<p>"Can I climb that high--" A-Mei asked vaguely in a long, trembling voice, but no one heard her.</p>
<p>The urging eyes and the hissing sound of encouragement, like dogs fighting, numbed A-Mei's terror. She nimbly jumped onto the stool, jumped onto the table, and climbed up the ladder one step at a time. A chaotic chorus of praise rose beneath her feet. When she reached the middle of the bamboo ladder, the ladder shook like a willow tree; she continued to climb up, and the people below shouted frantically: "Virtuous woman, capable woman! ... Hurry, there are only two steps left, turn your body over啊!"</p>

<h3>Financial Silver Price Exchange Rate Great Shrinkage Gold Price Rises Again by Six Yuan Four The US House of Representatives Has Passed the President's Silver Bill and All Amendments Have Been Voted Down</h3>
<p>The gold market continued its strong upward trend yesterday, with extremely firm sentiment. Although it hovered around the 30 yuan mark, it was finally broken through. In the early morning, the overseas silver market was flat in England but shrank in the United States. The forward silver price on the Five Metals Exchange fell by one-tenth to three-tenths of a cent. The exchange rate then shrank. London gold fell by two pence, US cotton fell by seven points, and US wheat soared by five and one-quarter points. In Shanghai, sentiment was firm and bullish, and short positions were not completely covered. The off-exchange goods initially opened at 27.8 yuan, then fell to 6.7 yuan. The market stabilized after opening, but the domestic market was very good, and sentiment was also firm. It rose once, but immediately fell after a false rumor that the HSBC Bank listed prices were flat in both England and the United States. The official announcement was then made that England was flat and the United States shrank by one and one-quarter. The situation stabilized and hovered between 6.7 yuan for quite some time, which was very stable. Later, the price of silver in the Seattle night market was nearly flat in the near term and rose by 3.75 in the long term, and it fell again. Finally, with stable sentiment and stronger interest from buyers, it remained stable at noon and also rose after the market closed. In the after-market, the silver price in the Seattle night market shrank by 0.25, rose by 1.25 and shrank by 1.25. Sentiment was originally bullish, so it opened high immediately. Although it turned back because the bank offered recent US dollars, the forward market seemed tight, and the upward trend was immediately visible, reaching the 30 yuan mark. After entering, although a pullback was seen, it was only a temporary sell-off. The underlying trend was still upward, so near the close, buyers rushed in, and finally broke through the 30 yuan mark. The closing price was still within 30 yuan. It was found that before the opening in the early morning, the Associated Press telegraphed that the US President's silver bill had been passed in the House of Representatives, and sentiment turned bullish. The reason was that the House of Representatives had rejected all amendments before the vote, which showed that the government leaders were working hard to extinguish all the amendments proposed by the opposition. It was expected that the Senate would also be unable to overturn or significantly modify the bill. The silver tax increase was difficult to cancel, and it was clear that there was a danger of continued release of silver stocks, resulting in the gold market becoming easy to fall and difficult to rise. The price of fine gold was 1038.3 yuan, and the swap spread was advanced by short sellers by 0.8 yuan. I will record today's market situation as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 1026.8 yuan, a further increase of 4 yuan compared to the previous close. The opening price of goods was 6.8 yuan. The morning opening price of the exchange market for near-term selling was 1 shilling 3 pence 4.4375 for British exchange, and 32.625 yuan for US exchange. Chao Feng Chang and Heng Yu were selling hard, and Mitsui and Great Britain were trying hard to buy. The August US dollar was 8.125, retreating to 6.1 yuan. Zheng Jin bought the October US dollar at 33.0625 yuan. Da De Cheng, Fu Xing Yong, Heng Yu, Yuan Mao Yong, and Qian Chang Xiang all came to buy, and the price rose to 8.5 yuan. Ri Chang sold short, knowing in advance that HSBC's listed prices were flat in both the US and England. In an instant, selling pressure rose, and the price immediately dropped to 5.5 yuan. But the second report came, England was flat and the US was down 1.25, sentiment stabilized slightly, Qian Chang Xiang and Tong Chun Lai entered, and gradually rose to over 7 yuan. Banks still offered July US dollars at 6.875 yuan, Da Xing Yong and Da De Cheng sold to around 6 yuan, Yu Qing Yong still entered, and it was still able to rise. However, because Qing Yu, Hui Xiang, and Da De Cheng sold off, it retreated to 5 yuan. After entering, the situation fluctuated, Shun Li and Shen Xing entered short, rising to over 6 yuan. Da De Cheng sold a lot of open positions. Later, the price of silver in the Seattle night market was nearly flat and the long-term price rose by 3.75, and it retreated to 5 yuan. After that, the situation stabilized. Later, Yi Feng Yong, Heng Yu, Heng Chang Yong, Shen Xing, Yuan Mao Yong, etc. jointly bought and rose to 6.6 yuan. Rui Xing sold short and the price fell. The noon closing was 1026.1 yuan, the goods were auctioned at 6 yuan. After the market closed, Sheng Da and Yuan Mao Yong, etc. delivered short and rose to over 7 yuan.</p>

<p>Sheng Da, Qian Chang Xiang, and Yuan Chang Yong came again to buy strongly, the price broke through the 30 yuan mark, Heng Chang Yong entered and rose to 30.5 yuan, Yu Qing Yong sold short, the closing price was 1029.2 yuan, and the goods were auctioned at 9.3 yuan. It was found that the highest price for one day was 30.5 yuan, and the lowest was 25 yuan, a difference of 5.5 yuan. As a result, it continued to rise by 6.4 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The closing price was 32.375 yuan, with HSBC Bank's US exchange listing shrinking by 0.125, and the combined standard gold price was over 1068 yuan.</p>
<p>According to the closing price, the implied interest was approximately 39 yuan and a few cents, which was approximately 2 yuan less than the previous close. The registered price for June was 1026 yuan, and the registered price for July was 1026 yuan. The morning make-up water was 1026 yuan, and the afternoon make-up water was 1029 yuan. The price of fine gold was 1038.3 yuan. Hia fine gold had to be sold at a reduced price due to accumulated sources. It was calculated that 1,400 taels were sold by the Tianjin gang to Ying Feng Heng, with an increase of 11.5 yuan. It was heard that there were still cheaper transactions. The swap was advanced by Ying Feng Heng to Run Chang Yong for 105 short, with the short side paying 0.8 yuan. Today, 161 public orders were released by Da Feng Heng, and those who took them in included Run Chang Yong 63 short, Da De Cheng and Heng Yu 28 short each, Qian Chang Xiang 21 short, Tong Feng Heng, Yuan Heng, and Fu Xing Yong 7 short each.

The morning opening price of the exchange market for near-term precious metals was 1 shilling 3 pence 4.4375 for British exchange and 32.625 yuan for US exchange, which was approximately 0.0625 tighter for both British and US exchange compared to the previous close. The opening was slightly tighter, and the process was also good. However, due to HSBC's official listing of prices, with British exchange flat and US exchange shrinking by 0.125, sentiment softened and loosened once, but the situation was very calm. Finally, the price of silver in the Seattle night market was nearly flat and the long-term price rose by 3.75, which also lacked impact. The market situation was calm thereafter. Although the price of silver in the after-market night market shrank by 0.25, the market situation was not greatly affected. After entering, the banks pushed up the far forward, and the process became tight, but the banks still offered recent US dollars. The closing selling price for the near term was 1 shilling 3 pence 4.4375 for British exchange and 32.5 yuan for US exchange, which was approximately 0.0635 tighter for British exchange and 0.1875 tighter for US exchange compared to the previous close. Chinese merchants purchased approximately 200,000 yuan in US dollars. I will record the day's transactions as follows:</p>

<h3>Foreign Loan Rate Soft, Market Situation Calm</h3>
<p>Yesterday the market saw relatively calm trading across various sectors. The foreign loan interest rate was at 8%, a further one-point decline compared to the previous day. "Scratched-head" loans with added interest were still at a 2% premium. The transaction volume for loan notes was over 4.9 million in the morning session and over 100,000 in the afternoon session. Transactions at the Small Exchange totaled over 400,000. Transactions for foreign collateral loans included over 700,000 in redemptions and over 900,000 in new loans. Cash receipts amounted to 7-800,000. Receipts and payments primarily involved settling outstanding amounts from the end of last month, leading to tedious procedures. Foreign banks received over 2.2 million in loan note payments, over 4.2 million in various commodity and exchange collateral miscellaneous payments, over 1.2 million in settlement payments, over 700,000 in telegraphic transfer payments, and over 1.5 million in foreign exchange settlement payments, with 800,000 in warehouse entries. Chinese banks received over 3.2 million in loan note payments, over 4.4 million in various commodity and exchange collateral miscellaneous payments, over 1.5 million in settlement payments, over 600,000 in customs duties, and over 800,000 in foreign exchange settlement payments, with 1 million in warehouse exits.

<h3>Small Denomination Coins Increase Again</h3>
<p>Small denomination coins have been continuously declining in recent days, and the distance from the highest price has already been twenty yuan. Although there has been a slight increase in the meantime, the decline has been more than the increase, making it difficult to make ends meet. Although there were not many transactions in the market yesterday, after the price decline, bottom goods have inevitably flowed out, so there is a strong sense of insufficient inventory. The price has a trend of rising again. The opening price of Jiangxi small foreign coins in the morning market rose sharply by four yuan to 837 yuan. Although the closing price in the afternoon fell back by one yuan and one jiao, the result was still two yuan and five jiao higher than the previous day. The number of transactions was 3,000 jiao in the morning market and 5,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The opening price of Guangdong small foreign coins in the morning market was 737.5 yuan, and it continued to be good by five jiao in the afternoon market, at 738 yuan. The result was 1.7 jiao higher than the previous day. The number of transactions was 40,000 jiao in the morning market and 20,000 jiao in the afternoon market. However, the market price of copper coins remained unchanged, at 330,000 cash, the same as the previous few days. The transaction price was 12,000 foreign dollars, equivalent to 39,660 strings of cash.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bond Markets Slightly Affected by Rumors</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, the market was weak, probably due to the tense atmosphere between Japan and Russia, and there were many rumors in the market. Although it was absurd, people felt weak. However, it is still in the brewing period. Even if Japan and Russia inevitably start a war, it cannot be realized in a short period of time, and it must be after the Sino-Japanese problem is resolved. However, many people in the market have become empty because of this. There is a congestion problem among the short sellers in the market. Therefore, every time the market price is low, there will be a rebound. If the rumors are too long and do not come true, it may cause a short covering. Therefore, it is not easy to sell short at this time, because most of them are selling short, which is unfavorable to the short sellers. If the rumors are not true, it will be difficult to cause a special situation. Yesterday, due to the prevalence of rumors, the long positions in the first session came out, and No. 5, No. 38, No. 63, etc. were sold. The intake of accounts such as No. 4, No. 11, and No. 16 was not large, and the market price fell in each session. Retail investors also sold more. The opening price was down by five fen to three jiao, and the next session continued to be down by one or two jiao. The opening price in the afternoon was still sluggish and fell by two or three jiao again. The closing price was uniformly increased by two or three jiao due to the stable news in the evening newspaper. As a result, the market price continued to be down by five fen to one jiao to three or four jiao. The total transaction volume was 9,551,000 yuan. The following is a comparative table of the price changes (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Generally Slightly Lower</h3>
<p>The New Feng Foreign Firm reports that wheat surged yesterday (31st), but the stock market was generally slightly lower than the previous day. US Steel fell to its lowest point this year, likely because labor unrest is brewing and a drought will severely hinder commercial development. Although the House of Representatives has passed the silver bill, the silver stock market remains sluggish. The small exchange market is slightly weak, and bond prices fluctuate, with US bonds being the most resilient. Wheat soared by five points (maximum limit), breaking through the one-dollar mark, for the first time since June 1933. The drought persists, with no hope of relief in sight. The company's New York agent also reports that the (securities) market remains idle, with prices slightly lower and public interest extremely low. (Wheat) The drought has not abated, and buyers are flocking in, so prices are soaring. Field losses are increasing daily. However, the surge is too fast and the footing is unstable, but it is advisable to take the opportunity to buy in when it falls. The weather report shows no change in temperature and weather outlook, and field crop conditions remain poor. (Cotton) The union has announced that 3,000 textile workers will join the strike starting next week. Some people doubt its success. Market news is not good, but the market can support it. Part of the reason is the impact of the strong wheat price. Trading is very thin. (Rubber) Prices have risen due to strong major markets and the Dutch government's imposition of a five-cent tax on rubber exports starting on June 1. Buyers' confidence has improved. (Sugar) The market is calm, with minimal selling pressure. Raw sugar buyers are still willing to offer 2.75 cents, while suppliers are asking 2.80 cents. (Silver) The market is depressed, with a total transaction volume of 440,000 shares throughout the day.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Rise Sharply Again in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Long positions emerge suddenly: Futures reach 85 yuan</p>
<p>The yarn market was flat in the morning and rose sharply in the afternoon. Because rumors were rife in the market, saying that Japanese yarn was trending upward. In addition, there were rumors that 4,000 pieces of Zhong brand 20-count yarn were exported. With these two major reasons, people's minds suddenly turned tense and buying surged. At the same time, the factories also closed down their spot yarn and were unwilling to sell it easily. As a result, the situation rose. A new high of 185.3 yuan since the new year was found.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster rises again by 2.6 yuan</p>
<p>The opening of the tender yarn in the morning was bleak, and the market was still flat. After bidding for two or three rounds, a part was sold, and the situation stabilized. Each month rose slightly by 0.1-0.2 jiao. In the afternoon, there were many rumors in the market, which were all beneficial to the long positions. Buying surged, and each month rose by 2.3-0.4 jiao to 3 yuan. The total transaction statistics for the whole day were 61,150 bales. It was found that Tongfu sold 1,050 bales, Jifeng 1,300 bales, Dafeng 900 bales, Suilong 900 bales, Yichang 1,150 bales, Dachang 1,200 bales, and Yuanfeng 100 bales.

<p>North Gang 10 Tianjin 50 Peers 50 Xiamen 5</p>
<p>Nanyang 10</p>
<h3>Cotton Follows the Rise by About Half a Yuan</h3>
<p>The cotton market started flat and then rose. With the soaring yarn market, people were excited, and the cotton market also rose accordingly. However, Japanese merchants took the opportunity to make profits and sell a lot. The general retail investors had strong ideas, so as soon as the market loosened, buyers flocked in. In short, the inventory is relatively thin, but the overseas cotton market is generally flat.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Cotton is Driven High by Yarn in the Afternoon Market</p>
<p>The opening price of the standard cotton in the morning market was softened by foreign cotton, and there was no change in each month. In the afternoon, the price of each month rose by 0.3-0.4-0.6 jiao with the sharp rise in the yarn market. The total transaction statistics for the whole day were 140,600 dan.

<h3>Foreign Cotton Drops Across the Board</h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton was weak at first due to bad news from Liverpool, then strong due to foreign merchants buying in, and finally soft again due to manufacturers selling futures. As a result, spot goods fell by five pounds per British weight, and futures fell by six to seven pounds per British weight. British cotton futures fell by one to three points. Indian cotton was strong at first due to Japanese merchants buying in, but then returned due to speculators selling out. As a result, Pingle fell by half a rupee, Aumla rose by one rupee, and Bairokhi fell by two and a half quarters. The original telegram record is on the left (telegram on the 31st):</p>

<h3>Grain and Flour Futures Rise in Unison</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market for each month suddenly showed a sharp rise. The quotation of foreign wheat in Chicago and Canada rose by 1.56 yuan. Moreover, there were rumors in the market that Russia had a tendency to purchase grain from China. Therefore, after the opening price, the minds of the near and far terms were exceptionally excited. At the same time, it was heard that the foreign exchange of the yarn and cloth gang was shrinking frequently, so they also purchased in large quantities. This state is no different from being revealed by speculative frenzy, causing the opening market to the closing market to be in a step-by-step tension. It is the first lively since the fall in flour prices. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, people's minds were still good, even closer to the morning. However, the Tianjin gang sold a large number of returns, so in the exciting moment, it had fallen slightly. Later, off-site speculation absorbed one after another, and the market was held. As for the factories, most of them were watching and not coming out, so the future market is still difficult to grasp, because once the factories come out, the market will inevitably change. As a result, this month rose by four and a half quarters compared to the end of the previous month, June and July rose by five and a half quarters, August rose by five quarters, September rose by four quarters, October rose by four and two and a half hairs, and November has already been sold, initially at 2.09 yuan, and the closing price is also good at 2.50 quarters.</p>
<h3>Foreign Wheat Drives Up Wheat Futures</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning, each month showed an exceptionally exciting state. The quotation of foreign wheat rose by about 1.56 yuan, so the market was shocked. Although the quotation of foreign wheat has not been fully related to the current demand, the market took the opportunity to vent the depression of the past few months, so from July to September, from the opening to the closing in the afternoon, buying was strong, and the market rose step by step. However, the inland gangs believed that the new wheat harvest was approaching, and if the weather remained unchanged within a week, a full harvest would be undoubtedly possible, so the number of people engaged in selling was also huge. There are changes after this situation, and the ups and downs must be great. As a result, July rose by seven cents, August rose by six cents, September rose by one jiao and one hair, October rose by one jiao, and the spot wheat market was still stable. There was very little delivery, and the price was unchanged. The opening price of Guide wheat was three yuan, and the opening price of Yaowan wheat was 2.97 yuan, totaling 500 bags, which were handled by Fuxin.</p>
<p>Rice Market Steps Up by More Than One Quarter</p>
<h3>Rice Association Founding Anniversary Today, Stop Pecking for One Day</h3>
<p>(Hu South) A total of fourteen or five late rice boats and eight or nine thick japonica and various colors (totaling more than 3,000 shi) arrived, and the situation was very tight. As soon as the late rice from various gangs was sold by the North China, Tianjin, and Weihaiwei gangs, the sellers shouted high. Those who were pregnant with goods took the opportunity to get a kick, but the result was just a boom, and the situation was flat afterward. Although Qingjiao, Songsi, and Liantang goods totaled more than 2,000 bags, the market only continued to rise by more than one chi. As for the thick japonica from various gangs, at first it only relied on the store's stomach to move around, and did not see any beautiful colors. Later, the Nanyang gang took the initiative to purchase more than 600 bags of Sutong japonica, and the seller once lifted it up, and the market color also turned tighter. The price of goods such as the Chang gang's Nangang all rose by more than two chi. Du Yangjian followed suit by a few cents, and Yinbianyuan also had beautiful colors. Today, due to the anniversary of the founding of the Rice Association in Shanghai, the colleagues celebrated by expressing congratulations, so it was decided to temporarily stop pecking for one day.</p>
<p>(Hu North) More than 20 boats arrived from various places in Hexia. The way out for each type of goods in the market, white japonica high-end goods were flat, medium and second-rate slightly melted, white yuan selected high continued to melt, medium and second-rate stomach was stagnant, thin rice transactions were flat, sheep Du Xian zero dismantling was not bad, and the port passenger pointed slightly moved. The market shape of japonica yuan was tightly buckled by a few cents, thin rice was added by one chi, sheep tip was added by nearly a jiao, and Du Port passenger was steadily standing.</p>
<h3>Passenger Xian and Passenger Yuan Increase Sharply Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation of Passenger Xian, the office stomach of the local passenger was active, especially the Fuzhou gang of Fujian Province was the most greedy. The Fuzhou gang had retreated and watched when the front rose sharply last month. Recently, the office stomach has gradually become prosperous. It has been more lively in the past three days. Yesterday, it went to each rice for more than 4,000 bags, mainly brown rice. The inland gang selected and handled rice, and went to 790 bags yesterday, which were from Hunan Shashi. This street also paid attention to brown rice, but the number of trips was not large. However, the arrival head has decreased in recent days, and the vendors are not as active as before. Once the local passenger is smoothly handled, the market will see an upward exhibition. Yesterday, the mechanized brown rice returned to good across the board. In addition to the higher meter, the big market goods rose by nearly a jiao. After the Passenger Yuan rose sharply to more, the market turned to a flat trend. However, in recent days, this street and the Beiyang inland Fuzhou have all inquired. Yesterday, 800 bags of newly arrived Xiang Yuan, 300 bags of Wu Yuan, and 400 bags of returned goods were opened. Most of them were handled by this street, and the market price has been 20 to 30% higher than the previous market. The price of Hunan mechanized yuan is 9.7 yuan, and the price of Wuhu mechanized yuan is 10 yuan.</p>
<h3>Wenzhou New Beans and Rapeseeds Have Been Listed</h3>
<p>Yesterday, new goods from Wenzhou were listed, including two batches of new broad beans shipped by the Haiyan wheel, totaling 132 bags. The quality of the goods was better than last year, with a status of more than 85%. The price was 3.5 yuan, and it was purchased by the Tianjin gang. Two batches of new rapeseeds also arrived, with good quality and a status of 90%, totaling 450 bags. The price was 4 taels, and 260 bags, the price was 3 taels and 9 qian, which were all the stomachs of foreign merchants. The soybean factory's stomach is quite healthy, so the upper and middle goods are very tight. Yesterday, the factory's transaction included more than 90 bags of Guide beans, 3,000 bags of Xuzhou beans, four cars of Weixikou beans, two cars of Yingzhou beans, and the remaining small number were used by this street.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Sees Rumors of Increased Donations in Chaoqing Production Area</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was slightly better due to the tightening of customs gold. The public association allocated 24 raw sugar white allocations at 20.65 yuan, up 5% from the previous day. This bank's goods were 20.75 yuan, transshipment goods were 6.75 yuan, and Dutch red and Taikoo sugar were unchanged. The price of No. 1 cotton white in this factory was still 19.12 yuan. According to news from the production area of Chaoqing, there were rumors of increased donations and the land price was tightened again, so the goods of this number in this area, when the current inventory is getting thinner, were unwilling to sell lightly, and the asking price increased again, especially the upper village. It was heard that hundreds of bags of white sliced sugar had been secretly opened, up 12%, and the quality of the goods was good, which was not surprising for the second village. Yesterday, the owner of Xinghua Chi asked for 13.2 yuan, but it had not been formed. 140 pieces of Shimen sliced green were continuously opened, and 10 yuan and half a piece. There were some transactions for Huizhou white, and the goods rose by 18 yuan at a higher price. The standard Wufu white ice was shipped by the Jiahe wheel to more than 200 boxes yesterday. All parties are in need, and the price is expected to stand firm.</p>
<h3>Spring Cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Report Good Harvests</h3>
<p>Gongbu Cocoon Bank's Collection is Not Prosperous The cocoon banks in the Gongchen Bridge area have been opened for several days. The new cocoons of the early and late gangs in the four villages of Hangxian County are gradually listed. The improved species have the most abundant harvest, and the cocoon body is also superior. However, the cocoon banks' opening price is not high. The highest price of Sima scales for improved species of superior cocoons is only 345 yuan, and the price of native cocoons is 223 yuan. Farmers' silkworms are not cheap, and they are all suffering losses. Therefore, the number of collections in each bank is insufficient.</p>
<p>Xucun Has Many Self-Reeled Native Silks Most of the farmers in the villages near Xucun lost a lot of early native silkworms this year. The categories were all supplemented with dragonfly silkworms and improved species. The hatching was later, the leaf consumption was more, and the leaf price was not cheap. The cost of silkworms was heavier. The new cocoons have been listed for many days, and the cocoon banks have suppressed the price and collected them. The market scale improved species cocoons are only 30 yuan, and the native cocoons are 18 yuan. Most farmers are losing money, and most of them reel native silks themselves and sell them at a price.</p>
<p>Yixing Cocoon Banks Opened One After Another Yixing's various cities and villages have achieved the best results in this year's improved species. The instructor's guidance is effective, with ten years of experience. There are more than 20 cocoon banks in the four villages that have opened, and most of them contract and solve for Wuxi silk merchants. The early silkworm cocoons have been listed. Due to the sluggish overseas silk market, the cocoon banks have pulled together and collected improved species cocoons for 25 yuan to 30 yuan, and native cocoons for 15 yuan to 18 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tunxi Zhenmei Soars</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was a drastic change in the foreign merchant tea market in this port. The market price of Tunxi Gaozhuang wholesale Zhenmei green tea plummeted to 105 yuan. Compared with the opening period, the market price was 245 yuan lower. Suian Zhenmei fell to 945 yuan, also 67 yuan lower than before. The situation was quite unfavorable. However, the inventory of Tunxi and Suian Zhenmei in the market was only 12,000 boxes. Yesterday, the market was almost searched and bought by companies such as Mianlong, Xiehe, and Tianyu. In the future, new goods from Shexian and Wuyuan will arrive in Shanghai, and it will be difficult to reverse the decline. As for the black tea market, the low-class goods in Wenzhou and Koukou are still selling smoothly, and the selling price is firm. However, the trading of medium and high-class goods in Qimen and Fuliang has suddenly become slack in the market yesterday, and the market is afraid that it will be difficult to stand firm.</p>
<h3>Hardware New Iron Wire Arrives Continuously</h3>
<p>Due to the shortage of new iron wire, the standard is quite strong. Because the bottom goods of the customer gangs are weak, there are many people who want to buy them. It was found that hundreds of barrels of new goods have been loaded in the past two days. For example, Gonghexing and New Taikoo have spot goods delivered.</p>
