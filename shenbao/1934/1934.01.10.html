<p>時評</p>
<h3>溥儀僭號遠東愈危·愼</h3>
<p>溥儀爲日人所製造之傀儡自「滿洲」僞國製成之後。日本爲暫時收拾東三省計。乃利用溥儀與滿洲之歷史關係。使作爲僞國非驢非馬之執政。又爲其軍事行動便利計。利用溥儀簽定之所謂日滿議定書。以實現彼在「滿洲」境内隨處駐兵之野心。同時更令數千日人。冒爲二重國籍。一面爲日本作政治偵探與軍事眼綫。一面在僞國担任要職。實行由竊據政治上實權。進而直接操持僞國之一切行政。然而此種情勢。於日本帝國主義之侵略。有兩大不利焉。</p>
<p>第一。東北三省爲中國領土。歷史上事蹟具在。任何人造僞證絶不能有損</p>
<p>於歷史上之事實。東北三千萬人口皆爲漢人。又屬不可磨滅之鐵證。雖在前清有滿漢不同之待遇。而近百年來。滿族殆已與漢族同化。非但無與漢族分離之必要。且亦絶無類似歐洲各民族間爭鬭之痕蹟。而語言文字。又復完全相同。此事也歐美列。强固已明白承認之。卽李頓調查團之報告書。亦確認日本之發動九一八變亂。實爲軍事侵略之開端。國際聯盟雖無力制裁但已公同否定其侵略行爲之非法。近且對日皆已嚴加防備。此其所不利者也。　　第二。英美諸國皆遠隔重洋。又爲世界經濟恐慌所困惱。故最近期間除經濟上略加限制。對日輸出貨品增加關稅而外。再不能有政治上之激烈表示。武力鬭爭不至驟然實現。不過日本兼併東三省之企圖丨所謂大陸政策之實施丨在以全力對付蘇聯。自日本進占北滿之後。日蘇間之衝突。愈尖銳。暫時雖不至立動干戈。而終不免於一戰。則已爲世所公認。日本如長遠利用僞組織。在政治上終難運用靈活。軍事尤不免有所牽制。此又其所不利者也。　　日本且認利用此種傀儡。操縱尙未能盡如人意。而溥儀近日又時發歎聲。再三請求重返天津。以過其寓公生活。日人因此感覺到利用操縱。有時而窮。曷若加速實現其兼併政策。轉多便利之一念。再日本倡「日滿統制經濟」也久矣。設令俾儡國果然存在。則日本在東北三省境内。所謂財閥軍閥官僚之對立。卽永遠不能消滅。亦卽其統制永遠不能完全實現。欲在東北三省收穫移民之實效。欲以東三省彌補其國内經濟恐慌。恐終將成爲幻想於是遂積極轉變。强制民意。令溥儀稱帝。使滿洲速化爲朝鮮第二。</p>
<p>再以軍事上論。日軍駐在東北者數逾十三萬。以之防制義勇軍之活動。以之鎭壓傀儡。固已充足。如以之對付其假想敵人丨丨蘇聯。殊嫌不足同傀儡政治繼續存在。則僞國軍隊。終必存留。此類軍隊之依附傀儡。不過爲求衣覓食。一旦發生國際變故。其不能爲日所用。勢理至明。是故日閥乘大戰之前。先解决傀儡。由帝制而降爲藩臣。今日東北之傀儡。明日卽爲朝鮮之李王矣　　九一八事變發生之後。吾入即逆料理北三省有陷於朝鮮之危機今竟不幸而中。恐傅儀僭號實現之後。傀儡卽將讓國。關東軍司令。卽將督一類之名稱。吾人不信請張目以俟之。</p>

<p>（四）其他特異之點、内鎭兩縣鄉鎭區及縣、均成立儉德會、提倡儉約、全縣公務員及民衆、均着土布、卽本縣所出之絲織品、亦未見有服用者、完全行銷於外縣、外貨之來、抵制甚力、凡本地出産、或可以别種代替之日用物品、一概不准採購外貨、違者貨物没收、並議罰、毒品已禁絶、紙烟不准入境、賭博及犯竊盜罪者、除本人治罪外、鄰長以連坐法、罰二十千、鄉鎭長五十千、區長則罰一百千、人民犯罪者絶少、監獄及看守所、門可羅雀、此等現象、誠不可多得、（一月六日）</p>

<h3>風浦輪接傷兵差輪</h3>
<p>萬象撞輪案　　已進行公斷</p>
<p>三北公司長江輪風浦號、此次由漢返滬、船至南京、卸去貨客、卽開駛來滬、當開離南京、船打倒車之際、因速度過快、將停在泰昌機碼頭兵差小輪名海華號者猛撞、及至船主發覺、海華輪艙面建築品、如艙室·門戶·等項、已盡被撞壞、當由差輪管理處、出向風浦交涉、經南京三北分局、允許將撞壞之處、立時全部修理、損失由寗局担負、風浦輪仍開駛來滬、幸海華差輪中、並無人在、故僅略撌船身、</p>
<p>在蘄江撞沉旅安輪之萬象號輪、現已由漢口航政局辦理公斷、旅安領江潘以象已傳到、萬象值班二領江、亦留漢、以備對質、溺斃者尸體已經撈輹六十餘具、其未撈獲之尸體、大致冲流四散、無從打撈矣、三北所聘之公斷委員爲招商局建國船主王友士、已赴漢口、並實地偵查、不日卽將開庭質審、</p>
<h3>長江</h3>
<p>華輪受日輪搗亂影響</p>
<p>國輪買辦呌苦連天</p>
<p>請求輪局减短比額</p>
<p>招商各船首當其衝</p>
<p>華商江輪、近受日輪搗亂影響、使各輪業務主任、次次虧折、至無法維持、昨日、招商局各江輪買辦、一致請求總局、設法維持、並减少比額、否則殊難營業、招商局已定今日提出局務會議討論辦法矣、</p>
<h3>日輪濫跌票價</h3>
<p>行駛長江日本輪船雖</p>
<p>祇四艘、但各日輪買</p>
<p>辦、於每次上下水客</p>
<p>脚、並無包繳限額、而於旅客乘輪者、濫放票價、且與各埠票房與黄魚頭密約、凡上海漢口間統艙票、照定例華商輪至少須收五元二角一人、日船减收三元、其中提出一元、給予招攬人酬勞、而於火食等、更予免費、實行以來、往來長江統艙客人、羣趨日輪、一般票房、向爲華商江輪拉客者、刻亦舍此就彼、至四艘日輪、往來滬漢、每次客滿、中國江輪之統艙旅客、已受重大打擊、各業務主任之客脚收入、已一落萬丈矣、</p>
<h3>小水脚亦歸公</h3>
<p>長江船業務主任、平時因薪工有限、不足理貨部工資三分之一　　全賴往來開班艙面貨之小水脚收入、與統艙票之贏利、上年、招商局自整理稍包、貨脚涓滴歸公以來、各業務主任之收入、因而大减、局方統計、僅江輪部分、當整頓之後、小水脚一項、年可增收五萬餘元、各買辦曾與局方一再要求、在公薪方面、亦略予增加、但不敷甚巨、昨據各業務主任言、近自日船搗亂後、每行一班頭等船、因比額等項、須繳五千金、故須虧耗一千餘元、卽二等船比額三千元以上者、亦須虧六七百元一次、並言長江輪買辦之虧本、要以現時爲最鉅、</p>
<h3>增加各船兵貼</h3>
<p>長江船往來漢口九江南京間一段、兵士上下來往、幾無船無之、</p>
<p>動輒數十百名、不特無船票、並須共給食物、占去艙位、尤其餘事、各江輪業務主任、已屢請輪局補貼、以免虧耗、招商局各江輪、業經劉鴻生允照各船比額减繳半成、各主任以距事實甚遠、昨又到局、要求增加兵貼、連同各項損失、請照所訂比額、减去十分之三、暫以七成繳付、否則殊難支持、</p>
<h3>呈請總理核奪</h3>
<p>此次招商局各江輪業</p>
<p>務主任、因次次虧本、</p>
<p>多則千元、少亦數百、</p>
<p>而各船所用理貨部職員、又有要求增薪之醖釀、昨日、同至局中要求减少客脚、因劉鴻生赴靑島、須今日乘江安輪還局、故由業務科將各主任請求之六項辦法、簽註意見、凖備今日轉陳劉總經理核奪矣、</p>

<p>漢口路六十四號上海綢業銀行、爲促進各員生之學術起見、爰有學術演講會之組織、前日特請國立商學院院長斐復恒氏蒞臨演講　講題爲中國過去外交政策之檢討事前曾分發聽講證於各銀行同人、是以聽講者甚爲衆多、斐氏演講時、態度從容、語多精警、茲錄講辭如下、諸位、兄弟今天承延松先生邀來參與盛會、覺得非常榮幸、現在就把「中國過去外交政策之檢討」一題、來和諸位談談、（一）外交政策的建立各國的外交政策、彼此不同、其不同的原因、約有二點、甲·各國地理環境的不同、大陸國的外交政策和海國的不同、沿海岸綫國家和無海口的國家不同、例如俄國僻處北極、缺乏良好的軍港、所以在帝制時代、曾極力奪取東南和西南的海口、以爲海軍根據地、所以當時的外交政策、是以此爲中心的、又如英國本是海島、但殖民地遍於全球、所以十八九兩世紀時的外交政策、在於爭奪海上的霸權、挾雄厚的海軍勢力、以保護分布各處的殖民地、一七二五年舉行華盛頓會議時、就主張英國的海軍、至少有能制伏任何二大國海軍的力量、又如美國是美洲新立的國家、恐怕基礎未固、歐洲列强來干涉美洲的内攻、所以就將門羅主義的外交政策、作爲堅盾、乙·各國人口物産的不同、人口的衆寡和物産的多少、和國家有極大的關係、例如英國是工商國、農産品不敷應用、倘有戰爭發生、就須先有便利的運輸、以供給糧食、方能免除饑荒、所以主張戰時不封鎖交戰國的海口、所謂「海上自由問題」就是、又如美國因農産品狠是豐富、主張海洋上厲行商船檢查、以實施所謂「海上霸權、」所以外交政策亦各異、（二）中國雅片戰爭前之外交、是無因政策時期、中國數千年獨霸東方、閉關自守、科學幼稚、交通不發達、環處四境仍都是蕞爾小邦、没有歐美民族的侵入、所以歷代以來、無所謂外交政策、最著的不過是和番夷通好的事情、如張騫通西域、鄭和下南洋等罷了、十九世紀末、英國代表團來華、要求互派大使、清廷以爲英國是化外蠻夷、非常輕視、故加以拒絶、一八一六年、英國派代表安姆斯德到北京覲見乾隆皇帝、要求通商、當時清廷就覆了封國書與英皇喬治第十、其中大都是恐嚇的言辭、和命令式的口吻、可見當時清廷傲慢的一般了、由於清廷的昏昧驕縱、就引起了各國的惡感、製成聯合的戰線、一八三九年的鴉片戰爭、因以爆發、結果中國大敗、締結了許多不平等條約、各國在華、享受種種特殊權利、這是中國外交史上第一次的奇恥大辱、也就是外交無政策的結果了、（三）雅片戰爭在一九一五年之外交屈服政策時期、鴉片戰爭以後、中國迭與東西各國交戰、如英法聯軍之戰、中法之戰、中日之戰、八國聯軍之戰等、無不屢戰屢敗、中國的弱點愈益顯露、列强輕視中國的心理也更甚、不平等條約的締造也愈多、國土淪亡、權利喪失、政府懾於兵威、屈服而不敢抵抗、任列强予取予求、以苟延殘喘、民族的自信力喪失殆盡、一九一五年、日本進而强迫承認二十一條、這時屈服政策的結果、國家已入於一蹶不振的地位了、（四）一九一五年至塘沽恊定之外交、消極抵抗政策時期、一九一四年、歐戰發生、給與弱小民族一個極好的機會、倘使此時能够發奮自强、中國就可復興、無如當時政府庸懦、毫無建樹、反屈服於甘一條苛約之下、因此智識分子覺悟民族的危機日迫、大聲疾呼、以喚起民衆、於是民族意識、漸形抬頭、革命的思潮、日見澎湃　、加以巴黎和會中國交涉的失敗、著名的五四運動、因而勃發、一方面文化上發生了改革、一方而努力去抵抗帝國主義的束縛、而求民族的自强、此後全國人民已努力於消極的抵抗外患、最著名的如歷次關稅會議、要求關稅自主、並與各國交涉廢除領事裁判權、但當時有一缺點、就是好高談濶論、如「打倒帝國主義」的口號、高唱入雲、這種空言恫嚇、無補實際反而引起各國的反感、而各國的聯合戰綫、又告完成、所以歷次的法權會議、各國對於廢除領判權問題、都互相推諉、不肯讓步了、當時中國外交已陷孤立、自從中東路事件發生、中俄交戰後、兩國邦交斷絶、中國在國際上就完全孤立了、因此日本乃敢於一九三一年侵佔滿洲、翌年進攻、當時政府與人民、一方面努力求國内的統一、一方面進行消極的抵抗、并聲訴於國聯、雖不能强制日軍撤退、然國聯歷次的議决案、以及調查團的報告書、都給以日本一種道德上的製裁、後來滬戰終結、簽訂恊定、對於中國、尙無大權利喪失、這消極抵抗政策的結果、效力也未見甚大咧、（五）今後的外交政策、自從墉沽協定簽字後外交政策又似一變、現在試問倘日本再進攻平津和察哈爾、或鼓動浦儀稱帝、圖侵佔内蒙的事發生、吾國有無相當力量反抗、倘英國進占西藏、法國攻入雲南、俄國占領外蒙和新疆、日本擾亂沿海各省的事發生、吾國更有無力量反抗、如今中國民氣消沉、大家以爲國事無希望、次殖民地是做定了這種心理的反映、恐怕今後的外交政策、又將回到屈服的時期了、但我們須知以前外交的失敗、乃是由於未能積極實行外交政策的緣故、試問孫總理昭示我們的「聯合世界上以平等待我之民族共同奮鬭」的政策、吾們有否實行、又如俄德二國是以平等待我的民族、但我國對於他們尙無聯絡可言、外交陷於孤立、那能不遭失敗呢、兄弟希望國人以後、一方不可自暴自棄、不思振作、一方面又須去掉驕縱的習氣、革除成見和感情作用、努力探求各國的國情和世界的大勢、並聯絡弱小民族、一致奮鬭、如此中國的外交政策、才能從屈服而消極抵抗、而進於積極抵抗、時期、到那時中國才能得救呢、</p>
<h3>市公用局</h3>
<p>完成統一全市電廠計劃</p>
<p>計劃分爲兩步　六年以來次第實現　　最近全部完成　綫路成一大電氣網</p>
<p>對於經濟技術　管理均有莫大利益</p>
<p>日前本埠各報登載南市閘北接通電綫·及大上海電氣網實現之新聞、記者以此事與大上海電氣事業之發展、關係至鉅、特向市公用局詢問詳情、據該局主管人員云、南市閘北接通電綫、爲公用局統一全市電廠計劃之一部份、此項計劃、早定於民國十七年間、其後逐步實現、至最近始全部完成、茲將實現情形、略述如下、</p>
<h3>計劃　上海爲我國最大都市、故其電氣事</h3>
<p>業之發展、亦最爲迅速、除特别區内</p>
<h3>大要</h3>
<p>外商經營之電氣公司外、屬於華商經營者、閘北有閘北水電公司、南市　　有華商電氣公司、浦東有浦東電氣公司、此外尙有翔華電氣公司、吳淞寳明電氣公司、及眞如電氣公司、共計六家、（一二八事變後、寳明公司合併於閘北公司、故現爲五家、）各公司資本多少不同、規模大小互異、情形向極複雜、公用局成立之初、卽鑒於各電廠分立之不合經濟原則、及現今世界各國電氣網新趨勢、乃審察各廠現狀、於十七年春、規定統一全市電廠之計劃、其步驟可分爲二、（一）停止電廠發電、改向大電廠購電轉售、使全市發電工作、集中於華商閘北兩大電廠、（二）華商閘北兩大電廠間、更經由滬西與浦東互相聯絡、使全市高壓電綫、構成環形、</p>
<h3>實現</h3>
<p>公用局自確定上項統一計劃後、卽按旣定步驟、指導各電氣公司、次第</p>
<h3>情形</h3>
<p>實行、規模最小之眞如電氣公司、於十七年十月、首向閘北公司購電、繼起者、爲翔華電氣公司、自十九年一月起、亦實行向閘北公司購電、再次爲浦東電氣公司、在黄浦江中、敷設水底電纜、接通浦西之華商電氣公司、自二十年三月起、實行向華商公司購電、於是浦東浦西、始有電綫連絡、至吳淞寳明公司、與閘北新電廠、相距甚近、故亦於二十年五月實行、向閘北公司購電、至此統一電廠之第一步計劃、已告完成、惟浦東公司、區域廣大、爲减少綫路損失、並預防過江電纜、易於發生障礙起見、除已與華商公司聯絡外、更有與閘北公司聯絡之必要、爰復在浦西軍工路五權路口、與浦東陶家宅之間、另設過江電纜、與閘北公司之電綫接通、已於二十二年二月實行、分向閘北公司購電、是爲實現第一步計劃之經過情形、</p>
<h3>計劃</h3>
<p>至第二步計劃、則爲華商閘北兩大電廠間之連絡、此次連絡、經長時間</p>

<h3>讀書問答</h3>
<p>學說的紛歧與正確理論的把握（二）</p>
<p>胡傑君提出的問題，的確很重要，值得我們作一番愼重的討論。但是這問題不是簡單幾句話可以說明的，所以現在祇能很粗淺的討論一下。</p>
<p>爲什麽學說會紛歧呢？學說的紛歧大約有兩個原因：第一，認識的糢糊。關於這一點有一個有名的例子，卽瞎子摸象的故事。瞎子因爲看不見，所以要用摸來認識象，但結果却誰也没有正確地認識了象，摸着脚的人說象好比是一個大樹幹，摸着鼻子的人說象是一個光滑滑的棍子，摸着象身的人又說象與牆一樣。他們各人因爲他們所感覺到的所經騐到的「象」，確是如此，所以便自信他們認識的正確。於是大起辯論，閙得天翻地覆。在不是瞎了的人看來，這種爭執，是頗爲可笑，但是由於這種誤識，我們却可以看到兩點：第一，宇宙間的現象的複雜，若戰從部分的枝節的考察，定不能了解整個現象的。第二，要了解現象，必須用正確的方法，瞎子吃虧的是他祇能用摸的方法，而摸的方法是不適用的。</p>
<p>其次，便是成見和故意的誤解。一種事情所以常常有兩種和多種解說的緣故，就是觀察點的不同，各人都各有一種觀察現象的立足點，換句話說，就是中心思想的不同。生物學家看見一片樹林，他心中所想到的問題是這種樹呌什麽名字、屬於某種植物；美術家見了，心中的感想，却是自然的美麗，及可以作爲圖畫的標本。所以悲觀的人所見的一切無非悲觀，樂觀的人則恰巧相反。這種事實是無可避免的，尤其是在社會科學中，因爲各人利害關係的不同，各人都以利害觀點是其所是，非其所非。又因利害關係絶對相反，衝突，務盾於是便産生了胡君所謂的「有時竟有兩種截然不同的說法」。亦卽所謂「理論作用」（Ｒationalzation）是也。狐狸想吃葡萄，但他因千方百計都吃不到，於是便說「我不要汔葡萄了，因爲它是酸的。」這種話可售嗎。其實是它吃不到啊！這種情形我們在日常生活中常會發現，卽所謂「口是心非」。</p>
<p>但是這種不合事實的理論何以會存在呢？這也是有由來的。因爲宇宙間現象與本質本來就不一致，所以便能容許不合事實的理論存在。反一根棒放進盛水的玻璃盂裏，似看見的是一個戀棒，但我們知道棒並非是入水卽變·我們每天看見太陽繞着地球走，但事實上却是地球繞太陽走。然而有人硬說棒入水卽變，太陽繞着地球走，假如我們不能用科學來證明他的荒謬，却也無可奈何。因此科學的功績，便在於它能認識本質，而不爲表面的現象所惑。它的任務便在於解說本質與現象不一致的原因。　　學說紛歧的來源，已精淺的解釋如上，現在我們再論如何卽可把握住正確的理論，這正是你所渴望得到回覆而我們所極願提出公開探討的。從上述「摸象」的例子裏我們可以知道這班瞎子的錯誤是在於没有從整個現象上觀察及没有把握住正確的觀察方法。所以我們要研究學問，尤其是社會科學，必須用正確的方法着乎，更須從全體來考察。道是治學的前提，但是這裏篇幅有限，不能來詳論方法論。好在我們現在正編著「各科自學入門」，你可以從那裏面去求得答覆。</p>
<p>然而辨别學說的是非與鑒别貨幣的眞僞是一樣的，所以雖則你有了鑒别的利器，但是没有經騐也是不行的。學問是逐漸的積累上去，你如要研究得澈底，必須增廣你的學識，谷說「不怕不識貨，只怕貨比貨，你所知道的一多，就可在某中比較其得失。總之，治學方法最重要的固如孔老夫子所說「吾道一以貫之」，然而這還嫌空洞，後來朱熹下的註解就要切實得多，他說「治學好比用繩穿錢，有錢而無繩，固是紛亂無頭緒，有了繩而無錢也是空無一物·」所以像你現在的讀書情形，我們以爲最好是遵守着兩句話，「學而不思則罔，思而不學則殆」。</p>
<p>上面所說，稍嫌寛泛，你旣喜研究社會科學及目前的社會，在這裏我們可以簡單的供獻你一點較具體的意見。鑒别一切理論的眞僞可遵守着以下三個原則，卽第一，從事實出發，不從觀念出發。第二，卽理論是在暴露並闡明眞實，不掩蔽眞實；第三，卽理論是站在大多數人的立塲，不是專爲着少數人。</p>
<p>你對於蘇聯研究似乎頗饒興趣，並且頗爲詆訾與頌揚兩方的說法蒙蔽。關於這種研究我們另編有研究書目，不過，這書目還恐搜羅未廣，你旣然讀過許多書，能够告訴我們一些書名，以備採擇那是我們無任觀迎的，近聞申報叢書中，已將英國新費邊研究社所出的蘇聨十二種研究譯出，二月後卽可出版，這本書爲實際考察的結果，而非道德途聞，並且其立塲不偏不倚頗爲公正，值得介紹給你；你讀了之後，或許可以將從前糢糊的印象變爲清晰。</p>

<h3>命運說</h3>
<p>— 席子</p>
<p>「一飲一啄，莫非前定」，「死生有命，富貴在天」。</p>
<p>奮鬥了一世，没命地向上爬，到頭來依然是旣貧且賤，潦倒終身。貪吃懶做，得過且過，過不去時，買一張發財票，竞會打中頭奬。自然，得意的，樂得死去而活來，失意的，氣得活來而死去。然而，這也是無所謂，天意如此。</p>
<p>因此，我們該明白挨人楱巴掌，是命中活該挨揍的，不能算是對方惡意的侮辱。所以你左臉上挨了一下巴掌，最好再把右臉凑上去，試一下子你的命運，究竟該挨一下，或是該挨二下。若你命運該挨二下的，那麽挨足二下，便會災滿福臨，太平無事。若是挨了一下，躱過了第二下，那麽寃災未解，今世不報，凖會掛上來生債。</p>
<p>「人定勝天」，最是不合理，旣是一切都有冥冥中的主宰，人定何濟於事。孫悟空跳不出如來的手掌心，便是一個很好的例子。若是人定可以勝天，那麽，醫學昌明，富人貴人，還怕不萬壽無疆麽。但是事實上，富貴者，竟會因息流行性感冒而不起，貧賤者，患傷寒症，也會通體汗下，不服藥而霍然的。諸葛山人，上知天文，下知地理，他何嘗不知道漢祚之將絶，但是他却偏要去扶着那個扶不起的阿斗。以諸葛的聰明，難道還會不知道天意如此，非人力所能挽回之理麽？但是我們該明白諸葛的所以如此，就爲了要迎合天意，因爲天意要諸葛這麽的鞠躬盡瘁。這正如明知血統將絶，還得娶一個小老婆來試一下。雖然在浮面上說，是試一下子命運，可是在另一方面瞧起來，也未始不是命該討小老婆。</p>
<p>明乎此，我們何必去研究燒餅歌、搯指計算着幾時大刦臨頭，更何必擔憂着一九三六年大戰。就是在馬路走，給十八層大厦倒下而壓死，儘不用上森羅展呼寃，這也是命運注定着如此。</p>
<h3>獨脚戲</h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>玄妙觀的空塲上，有一個囚首垢面的隱君子，穿着一襲百結的鶉衣，這鶉衣是舞台上的紅袍，前後的補服還隱約有剌繡的花紋看得出，不知道他搬演過多少次的戲劇了！那隱君了掛上牙鬚，塗上脂粉，就在空塲上且演且唱，像我這們完全外行，覺得也狠好聽好看。居然使腔使得悠揚宛轉，居然有台上，工架。假使讓他袍笏登塲，有一輩子文明跟包替他拜幾回塲，說不定可以遠追譚孫，近接王馬呢。但是他力竭聲嘶地閙了大半天，掙不到一頓夜飯錢，更何論過癮，他還有一個助手，是替他拉胡琴的，技藝也不差，也够得上稱他一聲琴師啊。</p>
<p>這頑意，喚做獨脚戲，要是引經據典起來，分明是扮孫叔敖的優孟衣冠，優孟只扮不演，還不及獨脚戲咧。不知怎的到了上海，獨脚戲不必唱；不必演，就是唱，南腔北調什麽都可以；就是演，扮鬼臉，做迷眼也不妨，却大得歡迎，風行一時。像王旡能一天要二十塊錢過癮，其他開支，可以推想。獨脚戲在上海如彼；在蘇州的玄妙觀如此，無怪給内地的火車輪船拖到上海去的人，一一多一天啦。</p>
<p>不過退一百步想，王旡能這們的走紅，還是身後蕭。並且在上海尋飯吃的人，差不多十停有九停總說僅能餬口。那麽玄妙觀裏串獨脚戲的老伶工，倒是一個知足不辱者。</p>
<p>我偶然和朋友談起這回事。朋友說，前年他到過鄉間去，比在玄妙觀掙得多些。但是後來，串得太搭漿了，便一天不如一天。依舊狼狽而還。我說，不錯，藝術家是有一種怪脾氣的，没有錢時，做得狠起勁，手頭舒展一點，就懶下來了。於獨脚戲何尤！</p>
<h3>森羅殿上</h3>
<p>— 曦兮</p>
<p>雖然是初冬的時分，一到了晚上，風是在街頭緊緊的刮着，似乎要下雪的樣子，格外的覺得冷了。翻起了領子，把大衣裹得緊緊地，嘴裏儘管吹着口消子，可是我的心終是冷而又落寞的。</p>
<p>轉了一個灣，霓紅燈的光耀跳入了我的眼珠子，又是跑到森羅殿上了！</p>
<p>足足有二個多星期了，整晚終是在這森羅殿上，擺脫了很賽貴的書而不去讀，擺脫了有意義的工作而不去做；朋友們都找我不着，不知我在幹着什麽把戲。有的說：「純潔的像他也會變了！他不是墮落了嗎？</p>
<p>是喲！我被都會的狂流所薰陶了，上海，這神秘的上海，本來是一只大大的染缸，跳進去終要變了顔色出來，然而我根本不會咒詛上海的，上海的本身没有罪惡，上海的本身不會使我墮落！自己雖然像孩子，然而有一顆心，有一顆堅强的信心，雖然就到冷而落寞；但終不會動搖或有悔的。</p>
<p>啊，這森羅殿上的景象喲！</p>
<p>全個塲子納入了黑暗，祇有Exit裏發出一些紅色的光，大家都吹着口哨子，是歡樂的塲面？是幽靈的呌喊？</p>
<p>那台上穿了夜禮服的音樂師，正像森羅殿上的閻王，燙鬈了髮的舞女，正像披頭散髮的囚徒；啊！這歡笑的森羅殿喲！</p>
<p>跳吧！乘着我歡笑的今宵，可是梵華林裏竟奏出Volga　Boatman，我再也不願聽下去，我的心變爲憂鬱的。亡命的白俄喲！你憶否被逐的一幕？</p>
<p>在這梵華林沉長的尾音裏，我掛着憂鬱的臉，溜出了森羅殿，嘴裏又是吹着口哨子，這顫抖的微音，蕩漾在大都會的子夜裏。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十一回</p>
<p>絮語燈前苦心訓弱息</p>
<p>杖游山下冷眼看英雄</p>
<p>但是不探聽消息，心裏總不得安然，所以在他心裏拿不定主義的當中，更是在楊家門口，徘徊得時間更久。這天因爲天上一點雲彩没有，燦亮的太陽，懸在蔚藍的睛空裏。半空裏一點風没有，温度非常的適合。趙翁心裏想着，人家都傳言西山的紅葉好看，城裏人眞有坐了汽車來賞鑒的，那末，自已住在海甸，離西山不遠，不要錢的兩條腿，舉起來是方便的，趁着興致很好，何不去看看？如此想着，在家找了一根棗木棍子當了拐杖，就走向大門口來。他一出門，見一個穿西服的靑年，只管在門口踱來踱去，看那臉色躊躇不定，似乎是等待着什麽的神氣。他聯想到大門以内，有個年輕姑娘是自己的兒媳婦，這就板住着臉色，惡狠狠的向積之看了一眼。積之却是認得他，不便置之不理，就取下了帽子，迎着他一鞠躬，笑道；您不是趙家老大爺嗎？趙翁見他彬彬有禮，這就不能再板住面孔了，於是向他點了一個頭道；敝姓是趙，倒未請敎貴姓？積之笑道；敝姓甘，和令郎趙連長相識，我家就住在這裏。說着，遙遙的向他家大門口一指。趙翁哦了一聲，笑道；原來是甘二爺，我也聽到我們孩子說過，你是個有志氣的人，人佩服的了不得！積之手裏拿住了帽子，又微微的鞠着躬笑道；蒙趙連長幫了晚生一個大忙，總想謝謝他，他又出發去了。晚生因爲看家兄的病，告了假回海甸來，過兩天就要走了，很想進去奉看老太爺，又怕有些冒昧。（二八七）</p>
<h3>白衣使者</h3>
<p>— 徐永泊</p>
<p>我時常想：那是奇蹟！</p>
<p>爲欲追尋那奇蹟，我也時常在這北四川路横浜橋一帶逡巡，躊躇，徘徊，歡望，猶如是一個神經病的初期患者。</p>
<p>究竟是異國的姊妹呢？還是自國的同胞？</p>
<p>至今，我還不曾能够决定，决定伊們是異國的姊妹，還是自國的同胞。但，總之是可愛的，一種東方美女的典型。　　而且還别緻咧！白色的帽，白色的護士服，以及白色的襪，白色的鞋子。不過有時候，也有着肉色絲襪黑皮鞋的，可並不妨害美的和諧，祇是更增强其美的調子而已。</p>
<p>講容顔，臉色是紅潤的，白嫩的，十分健康的；講姿態，步武是齊一的，堅定的，異常大方的。其他，頭髮，眉毛，嘴，手指，一切都美，一切都合乎美的條件。可終究看不出是異國的姊妹？還是自國的同胞？！！暫時，我稱之謂白衣使者。</p>
<p>白衣使者可以說是救苦救難的「觀意」</p>
<p>，　所以，伊們是以救護病人爲職志的。白衣使者又可說是生了幸福之翼的愛神，所以，伊們是會成雙成雙的結伴走向郵政局裏去投遞那愛的勅令的。在遥遠的山邊水涯，有無數靑年男子在佇候着伊們惠施甘味的生命源泉！</p>
<p>我時常想：那是奇蹟！</p>
<p>但爲了奇蹟，我是迷惑了。</p>
<p>小食譜</p>
<h3>嘉興的吃</h3>
<p>— 金孑</p>
<p>嘉興，這地方太熟了，十個上海人裏頭，倒有九個曾經去過吧！所謂名勝如南湖，烟兩樓，落帆亭等時常可以聽人說起，而在報紙上，也常有包括着這幾處小小的雲水鄉的遊記可以看到，當然已無再替它們傳揚的必要；就是嘉興的吃，普通人也認識得很久了，第一是南湖菱，第二是酥糖，此外，還帶些楓涇的丁蹄，杭江涇的豆酥糖。可是先生們，這是專供外路客人帶回去賣野人頭的東西，實在毫無足取；要問嘉興眞正好吃的東西，不妨讓我告訴你們一些。</p>
<p>嘉興的北門外，是著名的閙市；跨在城河上，有一條大橋，橋堍下有一家不很大的酒飯館。那裏因爲靠着河的緣故，常年有新鮮的魚蝦可吃，他們雖然跟西湖幾家酒館一般的把魚蝦養在用竹子欄着的一角小河裏，隨時取出應市；可是嘉興的水根本比杭州的水好，所以那裏所出的魚蝦，都有一種天然的鮮味，不比西湖的醋溜魚全仗糖醋帮忙。不信只要去試一遭，便會贊成我的話了。而且不但杭州的魚蝦比不上他們，就是蘇州無錫也是瞠乎其後。尤其是橋堍上這家館子的魚蝦更好。除掉魚蝦之外，還有炒山雞片，（做湯亦可）也是豐腴滑嫩，和别處大大不同。</p>
<p>上面所說的兩種東西，比較貴族化一些，而且鄭重其事的去吃，也很麻煩。在嘉與城内幾條熱閙的街上，還有幾家比上面所說的那家酒飯館更小的館了，每家不過一開間門面。所賣的東西中，有三種也類拔萃的奇品，不可不試。第一種是嫩雞。論塊賣的，其嫩僅稍次於老頭腐，不須你如何咀嚼，便可化去，而且是香甜鮮美，不可以言語形容。代價却祇須一百文，或一百五十文一塊。第二種是猪油菜飯。他們大都是用肉湯燒的，所以並不像上海的菜飯那樣過多脂肪質；而且燒得不爛不硬，端上來時外加一陣異香撲鼻，眞有令人垂涎三尺之概。第三種是粟子紅燒肉。肉大概多用的是腿上的精肉，略帶一些肥，煮得極爛，跟栗子安在一起，也是别有風味。這三種東西都稱得價廉物美，旣是十足道地的嘉興特産，又是最平民化的食品。上嘉興去的人，千萬别錯過了！</p>
<h3>松江之鱸</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>淞江之鱸，也許一說起誰都知道的，鱸在冬至前後最肥美，這幾天鱸魚在松江，又上市了，這裏，來爲讀者告訴幾件關於鱸魚的小事：所謂鱸，是一種魚名，色白而背有黑斑嘴巴很大魚鱗很細，頭也大，鰭和棘很堅更，大者達二尺長，古人所謂銀鱸，玉花鱸，都指這種。但這裏所調松江之鱸，便是另外的一種，爲松江所獨有，而他處所没有的。它身長祇五六吋，自魏晋以來便很出名了，松江人都呌四鰓鱸。</p>
<p>松江有三秀橋，就是秀野橋，秀南橋，秀塘橋，相傳在秀野橋的下面，所産的鱸魚，才是四鰓，其餘的都是三鰓鱸，至於三鰓和四鰓的分别，不是内行，竟看不出來，而市上所出售的，也大都是三鰓鱸了。因爲眞正四鰓鱸是很少的，但據一般的漁戶說來，最近四鰓鱸已搬家，不在秀野橋下了，搬在秀野橋北面，三里的相隔，楊斷那邊。這種傳說，也可信可疑，總之，所謂眞的四鰓鱸，是不易發見的。</p>
<p>因爲在古人的詩文中，對於四鰓鱸很多贊美，所以四鰓鱸在松江，便奇貨可居；加之産數又不多，所以到了冬天，松江的人便都把四鰓鱸當做送禮的佳品。然有人把四鰓鱸拿到上海送我，上海的人，每把四鰓鱸放在水裏保養那知不到一刻便死了，死的鱸魚，一些味道也没有了。</p>

<p>（星洲十二月二十六日訊）第二屆馬來亞華僑運動會、經八月之籌備、於去年十二月二十三日起、在吉隆坡安邦路實地典運動塲開幕、會期凡四日、至二十六閉幕、國府要人林森蔣介石汪精衛等、均担任名譽會長、參加者殊爲踴躍、男子部有星洲霹靂、檳城雪蘭莪、馬六甲等區、女子爲星洲、檳城、雪蘭莪、霹靂及柔佛等區、田徑成績、均見出色、陳亞九之高欄爲十五秒二、破遠東運動會紀錄、如計時可靠、誠屬可喜、女子鄧銀嬌之跳遠四米八七、不讓上海錢行素廣東李緩芬專美、球類興趣極佳、尤以足球爲最、左手網球家林望蘇、亦代表星洲參加、奪得錦標、全部錦標、除全能及徑賽爲雪蘭莪得、棍戰（卽霍藎）爲霹靂與檳城分得、及女子網球爲雪蘭莪得外、其餘均爲星游包辦、茲將詳情錄下、</p>
<h3>足球錦標</h3>
<p>複賽中星洲五比零大敗柔佛、檳城以三比一淘汰馬六甲、决賽星洲隊佳檳城隊、結果三比三、屆時曾再延長時間、一而再、再而三、共二十分鐘、惟雙方確係勢均力敵、結果仍爲和局而散、查星洲球怪謝慶福連日參加田徑賽、故精力衰耗、不能盡量發揮加以蔡文禮又因担任終點裁判員、爲公服務、不暇出塲、是以全隊實力减少、惟仍能堅持對搞精悍之檳隊、戰成和局者、已屬大幸、</p>
<h3>男子籃球</h3>
<p>星區男籃隊自淘汰柔佛、又殺敗霹靂後、其對頭僅爲檳城、咸以星隊實力之雄厚、早料對檳城决賽、當能勝劵可操、果也、星區健兒、精神奕奕、猛勇倍常、聯絡功夫、有如堅城湯池、攻掠進取、應乎順心、檳方雖一再誓師反攻、抬櫬備决死戰、但天命已定、究終被擒、計是役結果、星方以六一對二七、於萬衆彩聲中、奏凱而旋云、</p>
<h3>女子籃球</h3>
<p>二十六日下午二時、爲星洲　　女藍對霹靂、奪取冠軍、最後之决賽、觀衆人山人海、咸欲一覩是誰奪得錦標爲快、而雙方女將、因各欲爲本區爭取光榮、個個抖擻精神、左衝右突、有如飛燕穿簷、表演至爲可觀、但霹方究終不敵星方、故結局星方以四十四比十一、奪得女籃冠軍云、</p>
<h3>男子排球</h3>
<p>男子排球、星洲隊初以三對一壓倒檳城隊、繼以直落三局勝柔佛隊、與霹靂隊决最後之勝負、雙方旗鼓相當、星洲隊之選手、固爲本坡南獅隊中之錚錚者、及其他各排球隊之宿將、惟霹靂隊選手亦係霹靂各區之精華、其實力如何、觀於以三比二壓倒、頗有歷史之雪蘭莪隊、則可知之、惟畢竟星洲隊、球藝高超、砍球凖確、且能知對方之弱點、而前排躍起擋球得訣、亦係致勝之原因、故霹靂隊雖極力挣扎、作困獸之猶鬥、獲勝一局、終不免拱手、將燦爛之錦標、讓與星洲隊也、其結果爲三比一、星洲隊奏凱而歸、當霹靂隊獲回一局時、觀衆歡呼雷震以勗之、其興奮之狀、緒墨難以盡描、幸星洲隊選手、不慌不忙、繼續努力、照盡身手、遂爾獲最之勝利也、</p>
<h3>女子排球</h3>
<p>女子排球、獲得决賽權之星洲隊及雪蘭莪隊、一刻鐘前卽已整隊開行塲所、旌旗招展處、觀衆掌聲雷鳴、及開球後、雙方聚精會神、以事最後之勝利、然星洲隊隊員、多爲宿將、且聯絡功夫、頗爲美滿、頭排選手將球托起、二排中堅、卽行砍去、有時頭排選手一躍將球按下、球乘虚而入、鼓掌歡呼聲、不絶如縷、煞是好看、雪蘭莪隊、選后經此層壓力、早現不支之態、故結果以直落三局、勝利歸星洲隊、星洲隊選手、於最後之一局結束時、趕前與雪蘭莪隊各英雌握手爲禮並歡呼三聲乃退</p>
<h3>男女網球</h3>
<p>雙打星洲隊與霹靂隊獲得决賽權、二隊舉行比賽時、有網球癖者、早擠滿華人體育會球塲、星洲隊頗爲努力、且聯絡功夫亦較霹靂隊爲佳、故結果以二比一、勝利屬星洲、單打方面、獲得馬來亞數年網球錦標之左手怪傑林望蘇之必勝霹區代表也、果不出觀衆所料、爲直下二盤、六比零、六比零、林君大奏凱旋歌、女了方面之網球、原參加者只有星、檳·雪三區、星洲區初賽卽被淘汰、雪蘭莪得錦標、</p>

<h3>老家的放棄</h3>
<p>— 徐懋庸</p>
<p>羅憮先生在申報月刊上指出中國人對於老家的留戀，這本來是農業民族的一種特色。農業的基礎是土，！固定的圭地，因而農業民族大抵愛慕他的本土，離了本土，他們就失了生活的基礎。所以王粲說：「人情同於懷土，孰窮達而異心」。班超立功西域，年老思歸，上疏漢帝甚至於說：「臣不敢望到酒泉郡，但願生入玉門關。」這是所謂「狐死音丘，代馬依風」，可見對於故土的執着之深。</p>
<p>「家是我們的生處，也是我們的死所」。這正是主之子的大戀之所存。</p>
<p>然而，現在的情形已大大地改變了。</p>
<p>現在，有一類人是不願回到老家的，他們住在他鄉的都市裏，或者住在外國的都市裏，他們是闊人。先前的闊人是樂於還鄉的，以爲「貴富不歸故鄉，如衣錦還鄉的事，在他們看來已經毫無意義，因爲他們的生活的基礎，已不在鄉間的土地，而在都市中的工商業。他們用不到繼續取得鄉人的敬畏，因爲鄉人已不是他們的直接的剝削的對象。同時，鄉間並不能供給他們所需要的生活，因此，他們在異鄉或異國過其一生。</p>
<p>另外一類人，是不能回到老家的，他們從老家出來，在各處飄泊。他們之所以離開老家，是因爲在老家失去了生活的基礎，他們原有的圭地被奪了，或者僅有土地而無力耕種了，生他們的故鄉已無力養他們了，他們於是不得不向外跑。但在外面，也難找到生活的新基礎，於是，他們便「流離失所」。不久之後，他們就塡塞了異鄉的道塗溝壑。</p>
<p>從以上兩類人的增多，可知中國的社會實在是不住地在變的。中國人本想安於現狀，不願變，但社會變了，你的生活也不得不變，或者使你自願脫離現狀，或者逼得你不能安於現狀。</p>
<p>從這就産生另一種現狀。一面是都市裏有人躱在亭子間裏高呌「到農村去」。一面却是成羣結隊的人們從農村奔向都市。於是乎農村崩潰，都市恐慌。</p>
<h3>再談寫實的小說與第一人稱寫法</h3>
<p>— 穆木天</p>
<p>看見陳君冶君的「談第一人稱寫法與寫實小說」之後，我非常地高興。這一問題，能被展開討論，未嘗不是有益處的。</p>
<p>不過陳君的論點，同我的論點似有不同。這是我最先要聲明的。</p>
<p>我的問題的出發點，是在現在中國寫工人農人用第一人稱是很難以使文章與主人公的身分相適合，因之减少作品的眞實味。問題是有界限的。是在現在中國。寫的是農工生活。由這一點出發，我感到現實主義的文藝須有其現實主義的樣式。在現在，樣式問題，是須討論的。</p>
<p>其次，我要聲明的，就是陳君把我的意見發揮得以至於到了玄妙的境地，我没有說過的話，我没有想過的話，陳君却給我加上了。我並没有說過：「第一人稱，絶對不適用於現代寫實小說的，」也没有否定「在相當的塲合，用第一人稱寫法是可以的。」（這幾個引號中的話，係引陳君原文）不過，我始終終肯定：無論怎樣把題材處理得好，總是不會與客觀的現實以限制，會减少作品的藝術的眞實性。因爲，爲得完成「社會之表現」的任務，那是不够的。所以福羅貝爾抛棄了喬治桑的手法。這是一般的說法。而在現在的文化落後的中國，寫農工生活，用第一人稱寫法，更容易流於滑稽。</p>
<p>如上地，交代明白，以下，待我對於陳君的不同的意見作一個答覆。</p>
<p>第一，第一人稱寫法，是浪漫主義作家慣用的形式。自然，决定這個形式的，是那個作家的作品的内容。爲什麽那些人們要用第一人稱呢？那我們不能不歸之於他們的個人主義的抒情主義了。從文藝復興以來的個人解放的要求，作成了這種抒情主義的基礎。這種自我肯定的個人主義的抒情主義，自然是要求第一人稱的寫法。由盧梭以外，那成爲了文藝上的支配的風格。他們要求個人表現，熂以他們動不動拿出「我」（lernoi）來。可是由「自我之表現」轉變到「社會之表現」的時代，這種抒情主義的樣式，自然，要被抛棄了。因爲，新的酒漿不能裝在舊的皮囊，於是現實主義作家用了新的樣式了。關於這種論爭，喬治桑與福羅貝的往來書簡，是大可參考的。自然，那種形式是舊的。一種文學的樣式，有他的時間性空間性，有他的支配的時代與疆域。譬如說，在十七世紀的法蘭西，在宮庭社會中，在沙侖中，有「書簡」。「格言」等等的樣式，在市民社會中，有「小說」的樣式，而羅辛諾，高乃依的悲劇，與莫利哀的喜劇，也是不同的（不是「絶對」呀！）環境的産物。又如「獻詩」，也是有他的時空性的。形式的新舊，是以時代作標凖的。舊體詩是舊的形式，因爲是舊的時代的産物。用舊體詩不是不可表現新的内容的。可是，不能因爲有新的内容，就說那是新的形式。譬如，法國大革命時的歌曲，如「馬賽曲」，「卡爾馬紐爾」（Ｃarmagnole），自然，是舊的形式，雖然她有新的内容。又如貝得内宜沿用了「寓言詩」的形式，作了好些大衆的詩歌，但是你能說「寓言詩」是新的形式麽？我以爲新的形式，應當是指在現在産生出來的形式（如大衆合唱詩）而言。自然有生命的舊形式是可以仍然被應用的。　　第二，我以爲陳君是自己矛盾起來了。他承認了我的根本的主張：「第一人稱的寫法是不適宜表現複雜現實的」，而同時却又說：「但這並未阻止第一人稱寫法也能作爲寫實的手法之一；作品的眞實性，是要歸於作者對於現實的認識和表現的手段所達到的程度的高下的問題，與第一人稱的手法却無關」。文學的眞實性，是同在其中所反映的複雜的現實的分量成正比例的。自然，所謂現實云者，是要通過作者對於現實的認識的。而表現的手段與第一人稱的寫法不能說無關。假使作者「掛一漏萬」地表現了少量的現實，自以爲「於願足矣」，那自然不能算没有眞實性，但是那種眞實性是不充分的。那自然不是上乘的現實主義的作品。一般地說，用第一人稱寫没有受過高深的敎育的工農的大衆，無論作者的認識是如何的正確，總不容易把他們的性格如實地表現出來。在中國現在的工農大衆裏，恐怕没有人能文縐縐地述說出那一段自白來。陳君舉出高爾基爲例。但是高爾基的傑作「母新」「奸細」，「胆怯的人」等篇是没有一篇是用第一人稱的。陳君大概是專注意到他的回憶的作品，如「初戀」「我的童年」等。那些回憶的作品，是不能當作純粹的現實主義的小說看的。從「初戀」</p>
<p>等作觀之，高爾基並不是一個純粹的現實主義者。我們須要知道他也是浪漫諦克的作家。寫法同認識是不能分開的。陳君分開去看，是一個錯誤。寫智識分子時用自白或日記是可以的，如「飢餓」（塞米約諾夫），但是不能成爲偉大的現實主義的作品。在現在的中國，寫工農有自白與日記是不可以的。不要忘記，第一人稱是個人主義的抒情主義的形式，現在的現實主義所需要寫的是民族解放鬥爭中的工農大衆的情緒。</p>
<h3>新年在上海</h3>
<p>— 周楞伽</p>
<p>地球很快的繞着太陽轉了一週，又是一個新年。</p>
<p>新年，新年。這是什麽年？這是兒童年，婦女國貨年，躱在大時代前夜的一九三四年。</p>
<p>没有繁雜的喧嚷，年鑼鼓都失了聲音，代替着大出風頭的是纔來上海的無綫電王馬可尼發明的無綫電，嘩啦嘩啦的播郸聲浪充滿了全上海的空間。</p>
<p>三笑姻緣，啼笑姻緣，描金鳳，落金扇·······一隻緊接着一雙，不住繞着人們的耳鼓盤旋。外國人發明，中國人享受，這是天經地義，有什麽希罕？</p>
<p>路上，都市的脈搏在跳動；人的潮，車的潮，擁擠着向前。</p>
<p>大千世界的七丈高竿上立着奇怪人，許多人站在對面，站起了脚尖向他看。　「這個人多怪！眞是打破了登空的最高紀錄，從一九三三年到一九三四年」。一綫微笑的光閃過了兩個靑年的臉。商店的橱窗上，貼滿了五彩招紙，大减價旗在半空裏打游飛！幸福縐三角一尺，嗶嘰絨一元一丈。不景氣得可憐！　　可是也有着百樂門大飯店和大上海大戲院：</p>
<p>高聳的建築，美麗的裝飾，不斷地吐着萬丈光燄，炫耀人們的眼簾。</p>
<p>另一邊，工業在衰敗，絲廠在關門。這一切深刻地顯出都市在畸形發展。　新光大戲院在演着「鹽潮」，這潮水吞没了一切享樂的觀衆。每一個從戲院裏出來的人都帶着一張嚴肅的臉，口頭上有一股味兒又鹹又酸。</p>
<p>南京路上像在開時裝展覽會，摩登小姐一雙雙從路上走過：紅的胭脂，白的粉，靑春的歡樂在她們臉上跳躍。只是没有一個人身上有國貨的痕跡。可憐喲！這「婦女國貨年」！</p>
<p>一個衣衫襤褸的乞丐站在路口，齷齪的手從一隻破錫罐裏抓一把殘飯往口裏直嚥。</p>
<p>證券交易所裏，驚人的騷動在開展，市塲裏到處全是點壓壓的人頭，烟霧和炭酸氣瀰漫了空間。</p>
<p>「二十一號賣出······十一號買進······關稅·······裁兵······編遣······」</p>
<p>勝利的人在歡笑。失敗的人紅着眼球暗暗在肚裏呌了一聲「完了」，走出這市塲没的一些兒留戀。</p>
<p>「太太奶奶，少爺老閭修福修壽，賞一些錢！」一個滿面菜色的婦人拖着一夥破爛的孩子跟在人後面作着生命的哀呼，饑餓和寒冷的痛苦緊緊抓着他們的臉；在這一夥人中間没有新年。</p>
<h3>寒宵盲女</h3>
<p>— 魯吾</p>
<p>一道微弱的燈光，</p>
<p>慘白地照在路上，</p>
<p>更顯得寒夜的荒凉。</p>
<p>三五夜遊的閒人</p>
<p>緊隨着一個盲女，</p>
<p>像是同情，像是調笑。</p>
<p>盲女踉蹌地走着，</p>
<p>無力地撥動琴弦，</p>
<p>歌唱着自己的命運。</p>
<p>可是走盡了街頭，</p>
<p>遇不到一個賞音；手礓了，嗓子也破了。</p>
<p>閒人漸漸散去了，</p>
<p>祇有風還在狂吹；</p>
<p>吹散那哀楚的聲韻。</p>
<h3>兩兄弟（八）（一）</h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑著李維克譯</p>
<p>「你們已經徵求過羅蘭先生的同意，不是嗎？」</p>
<p>母子兩人的臉頰上都突然蓋上了一層同樣的紅暈。母親回答說：</p>
<p>「啊！没有，這事是用不着的！」</p>
<p>隨後她猶疑了，她覺得這事有加以解說之必要，她接着說道：　　「我們無論做什麽都不預先和他商量的。我們只須把我們定妥了的事告訴他就得了。」　　陸太太聽着這話一點也不覺得奇怪，好微笑着，以爲道事是狠自然，因爲那好人兒是什麽都不在乎的。</p>
<p>當羅蘭媽媽和她的兒子從陸太太家裏出來走到衛上時，她對她的兒子說：</p>
<p>「我們到你家裏去坐坐罷，我狠想休息一下。」</p>
<p>她因爲害怕着自己的家，感覺得没有藏身處，没有避難所。</p>
<p>他們走到哲安家裏去了。</p>
<p>等她覺到門已在她後面關好了時，她便發出一聲沉重的歎息，好像門上的鎖已使她置身在安全的境界裏似的；隨後，她並不像她剛才自已說的去休息，她却動手把那些櫃子打開，檢視着那一堆堆的換洗用的東西，手巾和襪子的數目。她把秩序變換過，以便排列和比較調和一點，這可以使她那家主婦的眼睛看着更加愉快；當她把那些東西隨自己的意思安頓好了，把手巾，短挎和襯衣排在特殊的擱板上，把一切換洗用的東西分作三大類：人身上的，屋子裏的，食桌上的。她向後退速一點來欣賞她的成績，她說道：</p>
<p>「哲安，來看看這多麽漂亮。」</p>
<p>他站起身連聲稱讚着討她的歡喜。</p>
<p>隨後當他再坐下了的時候，她突然悄悄地從後面走近他的坐椅。以右臂圍着他的頸根，一面吻着他，一面把另一隻手上拿着的一件用白紙包着的小東西放在壁爐上。</p>
<p>他問道：</p>
<p>「什麽東西？」</p>
<p>看見她没有回答，他便懂得了，他認出了那畫框子的形式：</p>
<p>「給我！」他說。</p>
<p>但她裝作没有聽見，轉回到那些櫃子前面去了。他立起身，連忙拿着這痛苦的遺物，穿過房子，跑去把她鎖在他的書桌的抽斗裏。於是她以指尖揩去自己眼沿的一滴涙水，隨後以一種稍稍顫慄的聲音說道：</p>
<p>「現在我去看你新用的女僕是不是把你的廚房弄得井井有條。因爲趁着她這時出去了，我可以檢查一切，心裏有個數目。」</p>

<h3>外棉助長標花漲風</h3>

<p>昨糖市雖值關金荷匯無甚變動、疲勢仍未稍殺、公會劃盤二四粗砂白普通貨劃十九元零半、比前日又小五分、轉口貨呌六元三角、原盤未成、荷赤無上落、八號十五元二角、九號四角、太古糖Ｂ嘜呌十九元九角半、無成交、本廠綿白續小五分、振記一號十八元一角、二號十七元九角、三號七角、四號五角、潮靑刁靑均乏續開、勢看續鬆、新碍靑昨開數十簍、價爲八元三角、</p>
<h3>絲花　海外廠經來價仍小</h3>
<p>英倫輯里經又報跌　英倫市塲自限制日絲後、去歲年底、華絲市價尙能立住、新年開市以來、廠銷不動、價轉平疲、昨據本埠英商泰和洋行傳出消息、輯里乾經英倫週一開價報跌、Ａ級繡麟、飛馬牌每磅祗開六先令十辦士五、Ｂ級黑獅牌六先令一辦士五、各跌一辦士五、扯合華幣因法匯放長、傾跌尙微、每包祇扯跌二三元、</p>
<p>川漢絲頭來源不暢　川漢絲頭、來源久難轉暢、獻歲以來、各江輪共祇裝到巾子挽手等七十八件云、</p>
<p>洋莊絲市價小停滯　海外生絲市塲、獻歲以來、仍乏新發展、各絲織廠僉以去歲營業不振、咸主緊縮政策、生絲銷用仍减、一般進口商以去歲備受虧蝕、手中存絲尙乏受主、不敢冐險進行、滬埠各歐莊昨雖接得海外來電、奈黄白廠經來價仍小、市氣擯持、現絲殊鮮成交云、</p>
<h3>土莊珠花略有走銷</h3>
<p>本埠洋莊茶市、自新歲以來、市面至爲寥落、日前各洋行發出之大批土莊珍眉電報、均無回音、僅土莊蝦目二項、昨杜德洋行購進四十餘箱、其餘針眉秀眉等花色、均無交易、洋行家以國外茶銷不旺、對於去年購定之貨、均擬展緩裝運出口云、</p>
<h3>五金</h3>
<p>點錫現貨大缺</p>
<p>點錫近市奇俏、因到少存薄、銷路甚旺、定價見漲、致本埠標凖亦隨之而飛黄騰達、荷蘭開價每担可售至二百零八元、福足二百十元、小供一百九十元、斗錫二百元、聞連日開出有六七百担之多云、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>「婦女國貨年」與日貨談</h3>
<p>— 木</p>
<p>晚飯後讀晚報、觸目的却是「新年第一聲日貨湧進」的大題目、而小標題又白「已輸入一千餘噸，日商會長大樂觀」。不用再談新聞的内容，已經學得有點那個。而這「那個」應該再三再四而且鄭重地聲明，並非敢於大駡出聲，只是···只是有點那個吧了。</p>
<p>去年定的是「國貨年」，今年却改爲「婦女國貨年」，這明顯地是告訴我們說道：去年的「國貨年」運動當中（一）男子們並不熟心購買國貨，或者購買國貨已經熱心過度，所以今年不要或不用男子們購買國貨了，（二）婦女們熱心購買國貨，或者熱心不够，所以今年歡迎或希望婦女們購買國貨了。如果我進推測的話並没有錯，那末自然今年的購買國貨的責任是在婦女同胞的身上，而男性同胞可以不管了。照道理來講，國家社會的事業婦女同胞並没有負起多大的責任，今年要她們起來專門負起這振興國貨的愛國事業，也是應該的，所以大多數是贊成之至。可是另從别一方面的道理來講，振興國貨的愛國事業由婦女同胞專門去負責任，而男性同胞可以不管，在男性同胞自己豈不眼紅，甚至於未免難爲情的吧？而且男性同胞是不是不買國貨了。不買國貨以後，是不是可以的或者應該的去買日貨？這就是男性同胞又覺得很難决定的事了。有一個朋友用說笑話的態度對我說道：某位美術家要作一篇連續畫，意思是第一幅畫畫着一對夫婦出門的時候逢着一個隣家太太，那位隣家太太問道：「你們上那裏去？」他們答道：「買東西去」。第二幅畫畫着這一對夫婦走到電車站，太太問道：「究竟上那裏買東西的好？」紳士答道：「到吳淞路去。」第三幅畫畫着這一對夫婦坐在電車裏頭，太太很奇怪地問道：「到吳淞路有什麽東西好買？」紳士很正經地答道：「買日貨喲。」電車裏的人都覺得奇怪，許多「？」問號在他們和她們的頭頂上爆發：第四幅畫畫着仍然在電車裏頭，太太又很奇怪地問道：「爲什麽要買日貨？」紳士很嚴肅地答道：「今年是你們婦女的國貨年喲！」電車裏的人這時男的微笑，女的不樂。······這位朋友是一個男性同胞，他對我說出這一席話，自然他是同意於那位美術家的諷刺，也就足見他這一個男性同胞至少是對於「婦女國貨年」這一種專門由婦女同胞去負起振興國貨的愛國事業的運動不大贊成。雖然他也不一定是「眼紅」與「未免難爲情。」而且男性同胞「不買國貨以後」，是已經有人帶憤慨地主張「去買日貨」了。</p>
<p>本埠「日商會長大樂觀」的原因，我想或者就是明白了我們中國人對於買東西已經「男女有别」，婦女同胞購買國貨。男性同胞購買日貨。所以「新年第一聲，日貨湧進，」以應我們男性同胞的需求，而促進「中日親善。」所以我讀了晚報以後的覺得有點「那個」，是······只是有點那個吧。</p>
<h3>新年這一天</h3>
<p>— 乎</p>
<p>新年，中華民國第二十三次的新年，終於在熱烈的盼望中到臨了；現在，又成了過去的陳跡。若是說要我在那陳跡裏勉强找出些呌人滿意的事情來，這簡直是不可能。然而有幾件零碎的事，倒是古怪滑稽而深刻地印在我的記憶上，呌我一時揩抹不去。</p>
<p>是這天早晨，才從洗面間裏垂頭而又好像是喪氣地拖着鞋子跑出來，就有一個響亮的「Ｈappy　New　Year」的聲浪從敵面來的一個漢子的嘴巴裏發了出來，我因爲没有提防，嚇了一跳。這名洋文的眞確意義，雖然我不大懂得，但據說「新年」裏朋友相見着是要互祝幾聲好話的，當時我心裏就立刻有三分明白過來，知道來者大概没有不善之意，於是放大了膽子，一連看了他幾眼。他就笑了；「喂，好大架子呀！和你賀年，你倒懂也不懂！」可不是嗎？果然猜着了，幸喜自己耐了一把性兒，不然，聽不懂洋話而錯怪了好人，或者甚至破口駡起他來，那豈不難爲情也嗎？但是，這一思念才轉過去，大羣莫釋的狐疑就緊接着跟上來了；開頭，我還只懷疑我的眼睛，以爲自己尙没有睡醒，來者大概是洋鬼子吧？我而，這立刻就被否認了，因爲他確確實實是和我一樣的一個黄臉黑頭髮的苦命的中國人，他穿的中國裝，除了據他解釋說是對我賀年的一句洋話外，他說得一口流利上好的中國話，他能拿什麽來掩飾或說明他不是中國人嗎？在「國難時期」裏賀年，我并没有反對的和理由必要，但賀年而必須要打洋腔，而且這洋腔又是出自黄臉黑頭髮的中國人的嘴巴、這倒不得不呌我覺得滑稽古怪而内心感到隱隱的愴痛和悲哀了！</p>
<p>還是這天早晨，拿到報紙就翻，當然是希望在那十幾張報紙裏翻出些好的有趣的新鮮玩意兒來。眞的，眼光才注上去，就給我發現了一個奇蹟！但這「奇蹟」倒不是如前幾天報上用白紙黑字赫然載着的「蔡廷鍇好險被炸」或是「婦女國貨年」「汽車大遊行」之類的奇蹟一樣的奇，這只是不過一寸寛，幾寸長的一則小小廣告而已，但爲着這廣告是與「新年」有關，而它的主人有是堂堂在朝的一品中央委員，所以我就努力開着眼睛看·是如此寫着的：「國難期間，恕」不賀年」幾個大字。於是我就覺得希奇古怪了；但不多一會，我就領悟這是藝術化的賀年廣告，再時髦些，大概是什麽「幽默」，是什麽反面文章吧！</p>
<p>是下午了，身上還披着夾衣服，獨自在吹着冷風的路上走着，從西摩路的最南端經過靜安寺路，折西，走小沙渡路到康腦脫路去，就只在這一路上，我碰着對我作揖上跪的男女老少們一共是三十八個，這一羣中，有三分之一是孩子，他們都向我要銅子兒，而且要的又那麽懇切，我窘急了，每個丢了他一個子兒。最後，他們都告訴我，他們是從農村裏逃難到上海的。</p>
<p>這一些都不足奇，在這個社會裏！</p>
<p>這現象是很自然，是很必然的。</p>
<p>還是這個下午，Ｋ領到二十二年份的雙薪水，高興極了，要我陪着他的朋友們去年電影。我跟着他們跑到「大光明」，因「客滿」轉向「卡爾登」，又是「客滿」，到「大上海」更是擁擠，而「客滿」的牌子也高掛着了。「他媽的，開旅館去，」Ｋ領着頭走進「揚子江」，賬房抱歉而又得意的答話是「對不起，没有空房間。」到「南京」去，還是一樣。是後徼天之倖的在「大中華」六樓的一角小房間裏給我們七八個佔據着了。</p>
<p>這更是一些不足奇了！在這個社會裏，這現象更是自然，更是必然。但，這矛盾畸形社會没落崩潰前的一種瘋狂的「廻光反照」，在這兒又是一個明顯證實的反映。</p>
<p>是午夜兩點鐘的時候，我疲乏得不堪了，辭了他們，蹒跚地拖着沉重的步子走回家來，見了床舖，倒頭便睡。然而，在這一夜裏，我又夢見大羣猙獰恐怖的魑魅魍魎！</p>

<h3>拓聲劇社公演參觀記（續）</h3>
<p>第三幕開塲，已經是隔了好幾年的事，亞羅與路史是當家，女兒也已經七八歲。因爲亞羅是一個空想家，只會讀書不會種田，父親惱恨哥哥亞安航海而積惱成疾以死，他們的家業漸漸中落，生活也較困難，開幕的時候，路史的媽丨一個不能走路的癱瘋症的老妇人丨坐在有輪子的椅上和亞羅的媽談　　，說是聽說亞羅媽將田地去押給别人，得了　　　　　　怎麽得了！年老的媽嘆着氣在希望她的大兒子亞安的歸來。路史牽了在外頭玩要的女兒進來，化妝完全變啦，第一幕她是一個活潑的小姑娘，這回已經是一個端莊的少婦。她的媽要到外頭曬太陽，亞羅的媽陪她出去，她推着那有輪子的椅進後合然後出來逗小女孩睡覺，可是那小女孩偏不睡覺。亞農進來了，靑春已失，十分衰頽，已經是一個中年人，他愛小女孩，小女孩也愛爸爸，她進廚房替他料理晚餐，他就送小女孩上床睡覺。在幕後的催眠歌，唱的眞好。可是一出塲却看起書來，連他的妻送給他吃的晚餐都無心吃下，這使路史氣惱了。這時他們的工人朋恩進來辭職，說是他忍不住農人們的恥笑，又要工錢，他却没有，這是一個多麽大的刺激！她的妻路史這時非常埋怨他，後悔和他結婚，互相吵駡起來，路史甚至公開地說她愛亞安。她愛亞安，因爲她已經給平凡瑣碎的生活厭煩了。她時常將亞安寄來的信拿出來看，讀，誦，她希望亞安快點歸來。這又是一個多麽大的刺激！門外汽車的喇叭聲呌了，路史以一種極大的歡喜去迎接亞安，要求他住下不再去航海，這時的亞羅所受的刺激已經將他快要發犯了。</p>
<p>第四幕開塲的時候，又隔了五年，亞羅的媽已經死去，他的小女孩，可愛的小女孩也已經死去，他受了事業失敗的刺激，妻子變心的刺激，他害了很利害的肺病，快要死了。幕開時，那癱瘋的老太婆偏還活着，在火爐邊烘火睡去，亞羅從内室出來、路史暗示他不要驚醒她媽，他眞氣惱。路史這一回的化妝又不同啦，靑春已跟着辰光消逝，憔悴的容顔、襤褸的衣服，表現出她已經是一個飽經風霜中年婦人了。莉影女士在這一劇中，表演着少女少婦中年婦人三個時期的角色，眞是成功哩。假如她進電影界，我相信她的成轼更大呵。這是閒話，日說，亞羅自言自語地在念着亞安這時爲什麽不回來，路史說是打電報去的，這早晚一定回來的，談了一些話支持不住又進房去。門外喇叭聲又呌起來，驚醒了在火爐邊睡覺的老太婆，因爲怕人看見這個　褸的人呌她女兒路史將她推進廚房去。亞安請了醫生進塲。亞安這時已經是有鬍子的中年男子，服務也變成一個城市的商人的模樣，和路史招呼以，急請醫生進内室去看亞羅的病。醫生在看病的時候，亞安出來責問路史，爲什麽不早點將亞羅的病告訴他，他愛他的弟弟，他知道他的弟弟是因爲路史的變心而病的，他不能够諒恕路史，他堅决她聲明他並不愛路史。醫生看了病出也，表示没救而去，亞安是多麽的難過呵！不料亞羅抱病又出塲，倒在　椅上，勸亞安愛路史，說是他死了以後要亞安要路史爲妻，路史抱頭大哭，亞安扶他進内室睡覺。亞安對於路史大加責備，又叙述他因爲在交易所與金融資本家鬥爭失敗，現在才願意回家來種田，他對於前途也是感覺到十分黯淡。不料當他們進内室去看病人的時候，病人却從窗口逃走去了。</p>
<p>劇情到這時實在也已經到了頂點可以結束了，因此觀衆多數散塲。據說還有一幕，我就還坐下去，但觀衆只有一二十個人。台上聽到一人說道，「人都散了，不演算了，趙丹出去報告，」可是只聽得我們的女主角大呌，「演呀演呀，没有人也要演下去！」於是乎佈景師忙起來。實在的，演劇是應該對藝術忠實的，只有觀衆一人也應該演下去的呵。（幾年前南國社演劇就有這麽一回事：只到一個觀衆，他們還是開演。）　　第五幕是在矌野，亞羅悲傷的瘋狂的大呌着，「自由」，「我的航海起點啦」！倒地而死，亞安和路史追到已經來不及了。丨結果是一幕悲劇。散塲已經是新年的午前一時了。</p>
<p>總觀全劇，女主角是成功了的，佈景，燈光都好。尤其是全體演員很嚴肅他認眞地努力地在表演，這於新劇社的首次公演是多麽可佩服的。願祝努力。</p>

<h3>中國出洋之人与物</h3>
<h3>過去與現在</h3>
<p>— 敬嘉</p>
<p>過去好呢，還是現在好呢？我相信所有的回答都說過去好的。一個年老的人無想起他年靑的時候而覺到那時候的滿足的。處在現今世界上的人都會對現今不滿，而追慕過去的時代的。「不滿於現在，而羨慕於過去」這是人類的一種普遍的患想。</p>
<p>其實，世界是一天進步一天的，只有現在比以前好，决不會過去比現在好的。舉一個例說罷，據老前輩說在二十年前如果要從曹家渡到提籃橋去，至少要化四個鐘頭才能到，然而現在我們可以在四十分鐘裏横穿這巍大的都市丨丨上海。從這一點上，我們就可以知道現在是比過去好。無論在那一點上都可以證明的。</p>
<p>「不滿現在，而追羨過去」雖是人類的一種思想，但我們絶對不能說這個思想是錯誤的，同時我們也不能把不知足的罪名加在有這種思想的人頭上去。因爲社會之所以能有無窮的進化，就是繁維在這個思想上的。人們對於現在有所不滿，才能使社會有所進步。</p>
<p>但是我們不能說有了這個思想就可以使社會自己進步的。譬如我們覺到自己的手不乾凈，假使我們不把手放在水裏洗一洗，那手兩也不會乾凈的。所以當我們有了對現今不滿之處之後，就應該把這不滿意的地方改造一下。</p>
<p>「過去」是环會復返的，堯舜之世没有在現在的世界上再臨的可能的。不要追慕「以往」吧，我們來改造我們的「現在」！因爲我們都是現在的人啊！</p>
<h3>街頭的老人</h3>
<p>— 曼</p>
<p>一個風蕭肅雨蕭蕭的黄昏時候，我從呂班路要穿過華龍路，到了一條外國人住宅所在的僻靜馬路，一個老人挑着麵擔在前頭一歪一斜地走着，忽然間不知道怎樣脚下一溜跌倒地地下，麵擔上的碗碟打得粉碎。我走向前將他扶起，他放聲哭着，眼涙在他的蒼白衰老的臉孔上直流。路人都圍攏來看熱閙。他帶哭地說，「一家人靠我吃飯的，現在生意做不成了！」江北人的口音，似乎是農村來的。路人看一看便走開了，誰都朝着他冷笑。我給他一些小錢，告訴他以後走路得小心留意。一個外國太太從樓上看到，呌她的用人送一些銅板給他，那用人是中國同胞，帶着微笑地說，「喂，外國太太給你的。再來一次那就不是生意經。」這是對他的侮辱，我發怒地望他一眼。他似乎明白了我的心理，對我說，「他是故意跌倒的，你看他的麵擔成樣不成樣！」我看了他的麵擔旣不生火而且生塵，原來這是銅術！　　我自己也覺得好笑，走開了。可是一路上總是把這件事停留在心裏：那老人怎麽想出這樣一種生活之道？······</p>

<h3>票欵糾葛</h3>
<p>憑票匯付</p>
<p>（票認原手）</p>
<p>某某寳號（丁）大洋若干元</p>
<p>某某寳號（丙）騐兌　○月○日期</p>
<p>圖章　票（乙）</p>
<p>上項匯票，依素來習慣，出票人係與票面所載之受票人直接交接：並在票面蓋有「票認原手」四字，以表白此票之性質，及促讓受人之注意。於理對於讓受之持票人，出票人本不負任何責任。茲有讓受人甲，手持民國十七年，與上票同樣性質之匯票若干元，向出票人乙無理取閙，意圖混賴；未悉出票人乙，有否未盡手續，致負法律上！·　　任？毅手續不完，但爲時已踰五載，此票有效時期，是否因年久而消滅　乞　先生作爲一一指示之，至感；並祈卽日直接答覆；儾民　愈佳了。</p>
<p>立大愼申莊謹啓</p>
<p>Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ</p>
<p>編者按，匯票之當事人有三；（一）出票人卽右票内之某乙，（二）收欵人，或稱抬頭人；卽某丁，（三）付欵人，卽某丙。此項匯票之出立，所以表示某乙在約定日期應何某于與票面同數之金額；因同時某丙亦須給付某乙金額，爲節省手續計，某乙出立此項匯票，囑某丁直接向某内兌付，依照通常習慣，某丁得此匯票後，應卽陳示於某丙；某丙應卽在票背蓋章認付，是爲照票。匯票經照票手續後，某丙應在應付某乙之欵項内，截留此數，故其付欵責任，已移轉於付欵太丙，出票人乙不過負保付之責任矣。匯票雖註有「票認原手」字樣，但收欵人丁，仍得在票背蓋章批明，轉讓於讓受人，到期讓受人得要求出票人或付欵人照付。如到期抬頭人踪跡不明，或無力偕付；出票人决不能根據「票認原手」四字，拒絶將票欵付於讓受人；因爲這樣在法律上就觸犯「出立僞票，以便利他人犯罪」之條規了。上面來信所說的那張匯票，讓受人甲，不向某丁交涉，而採取直接向出票人交涉，則某丁之目下狀况，大概不出於踪跡不明，或無力償付之兩途了。而出票人對此，其所負責任如下：</p>
<p>甲　票欵已由收欵人，冒稱遺失，早已取去。卽在這一種情形之下，也有下列三種不同的責任：</p>
<p>（一）當丁聲明遺失之後，票欵未取之前，曾在被法院所認可之報紙上，登有聲明者。這樣出票人就不負任何責任，讓受人祇有設法與某丁交涉。</p>
<p>（二）當時並未登報聲明，不過由某乙出立筆據，央同中保作證者。這樣情形之下，此項筆據，不能據以對抗不知情之第三者某甲；應由出票人負責理直，再行責成中保向某丁理楚。</p>
<p>（三）當時因係相知友好，並無若何手續者：那麽出票人祇有自認手續差誤，認虧了結。</p>
<p>乙　票欵並未過付，不過因有「票認原手」四字，恐目下丁雖踪跡不明，日後發生糾葛，因而拒付者。這樣可囑甲出具字據，央同殷實保證人，再行領去。决不能因爲時隔五載，就拒絶付欵的。</p>

<p>有時做一些徒手操，這完全是他杜造的，或者是從小孩子得來的操法！！在我們的身體極度向下朝前曲肺壓小得連氣也難得呼吸時，還要我們大聲喊數；在向上向後用腰灣下去，連喉頭都逼不出聲音的時候也要喊。他不管你生理上會受到壞的影響。</p>
<p>在我們的呼吸和體勢還未恢復平靜狀態時他就把我們塞進監房去吸不很流重的空氣。</p>
<p>現今我們的運動塲是爲三條監房的建築直綫，一首墻所規定的長方形，運動就是排了隊成圓形的轉，做動作是少的。在我們常踏的所在成了圈形的一條黄色砂土路。</p>
<p>星期六我和烏數步數，每圈共八十八步，共轉了十六圈，如用步兵操每分一百四十步算起來，只有九分又三分之一分！！這算是他！！敲大鼓的，我不是輕蔑他，人都如此呌他，並我也不能記得他姓，記這綽號比記姓容易。！！最長，最最長，最寛宏大量的給犯人的施捨了，而且他也想到它而感到滿足了。</p>
<p>在職務所必要做的工作以下許多倍數的勞働在他是過分的勞働，對於犯人的服務變了管理並且在性質上變了義務的和施捨的了。犯人不能要求他，要求即是反抗或者搗蛋，就有被釘鐐或打板子的危險。</p>
<p>平均起來犯人們在那樣大！！比監房大得幾百倍的運動塲上每天祇能停留一分鐘。這就是在麥觀人耳朶裏面所聽到我們可以去活動大隊二八時或整天的實際上的内容。</p>
<p>在這監裏空塲是這麽多，這麽惑人；但農又這麽窄小這麽無用！</p>

<h3>世界文學名著與中國電影（下）</h3>
<p>— 羅平</p>
<p>那麽我們就可以結論說：「少年維持之煩惱」和「茵夢湖」之搬上銀幕是需要的嗎？我們的回答是「否」。</p>
<p>假如，「怒吼吧中國」，這正確地描寫了中國民衆的反帝運動的力作，是值得我們介紹的，爲什麽我們不介紹到銀幕上去呢？</p>
<p>又如日本村山知義的「最初的歐羅巴之旗」，這是描寫中國近代史上一個最重要的歷史的關鍵，帝國主義侵略中國，使封建後期的中國開始向殖民地轉化的一八四○年的雅片戰爭的舞毫劇，我們爲什麽不把它搬上銀幕呢！</p>
<p>據說這二個舞臺劇，都有人在想把它搬上銀幕了，這是一個可喜的消息。　　退一步說，就是寫戀愛故事的吧。譬如柯嵛泰女士的「愛的分野」總要有意義一點，我們爲什麽不把它搬上銀幕呢？</p>
<p>在文學作品和電影交流的前途，我們看到可怕的陰影。</p>
<p>「春蠶」這全新的一個類型，已被搬上銀幕了，此外第一種是「二度梅」式的封建社會的兩性關係觀，其次是「乾隆下江南」的封建社會的武士道和直接擁護封建社會的說敎，又其次是純空想的，逃避現實的「等待主義」的「江湖奇俠傳」，又其次是小脚放大的鴛鴦蝶派小說，但純粹自由主義文學並未與電影結合過。或許是著者淺聞，没有知道。我們不妨把「少年維特之煩惱」和「茵夢湖」的搬上銀幕看作自由主義文字與中國電影交流的第一次吧。</p>
<p>「二度梅」，「乾隆下江南」以至「江湖奇俠傳」，可以說是已成陳跡了。「春蠶」類型電影作品的前進又將走到現社會給予的限度，必須像雞雛的破了它的外殼的障礙一樣的，在次一代才能大大的發展起來。</p>
<p>鴛鴦蝴蝶派的小說以至新的鴛鴦蝴蝶派的小說在這年頭、無疑的可以交運，「少年維特之煩惱」和「茵夢湖」正是他們的老師，雖然他們之間存在着大的然而不是根本的差異。</p>
<p>最後，我得指明介紹世界文學名作的努力，並不是需要；相反地，因爲現代中國文學上缺少眞正成功的作品之故，像向蘇聯之借取「怒吼吧中國」，把日本「最初的歐羅巴之旗」介紹進來，是有非常迫切的需要的。</p>
<p>對於中國文學作品之改編爲電影劇本，還有一點意見：雖然中國缺少成功的作品，但搬上銀幕，根本就等於重作一下，那麽我們也不妨把作品中所含的缺點。細細地改過。換言之，就是我們也需要批判地把現代中國文學搬上銀幕。（完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「未了塵緣」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>One　Way　Passage</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>當我們讀到小仲馬或是王爾德的小說的時候，那劇烈的情感，深刻的描畫，常使深深的驚奇讀嘆，而佩服他們神妙的天才。自然，那種極成熟的舊的手法，只够表現舊的内容。而</p>
<p>「茶花女」或「莎樂美」所以能强制他人的情感，主要的是由於形式上的成功。</p>
<p>同樣，在電影方面我們也可舉出許多成功的作品。雖然是舊的東西，在目前已經漸次消失了存在的價值，然而那十分成熟的乎法，到底是够我們欣賞的了。「羅宮春色」可使非基督敎徒同情基督敎徒的命運，「幸運之狗」可使人們可憐狗的悲哀；卽使是有毒的說敎，也不能缺乏天花亂墜的言詞。自然，我們决不會忘記批判的學習的名言，而在欣賞的目的之下，對於一切舊的藝術仍然有分柝和檢討的必要。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>大量生産的美國影片，常因其内容的陳腐或毒害而遭受着人們的指斥。不過在舊型的作品之中仍然有許多甚有價值的成績。過去的不必枚舉，而這一部華納出品的「未了塵緣」又是值得我們相當注意的了。</p>
<p>一般的說，華納兄弟影片公司的出品，有不少是頗有價值的，雖然它的生産品並不像米高梅或派拉夢那般豐富。據說，華　多製暴露影片，這使我馬上想起去年在國泰開映的「生意經」。當然决不會有什麽十分尖銳的東西，而像「生意經」之類的對於不景氣時代的小商人的營業上的競爭，確是寫得十分深刻的。此外，那「大富豪」的大財生因勞働而恢復健康，有　地方也覺得很有道理似的。現在，這以倫理片的形式而固情大盜死前的悲哀的「未了塵緣」，在目前一般人們對於盜匪没有理的而深切痛恨的情形之中，未嘗不是消極的對於旣成的心理來一種刺戟。</p>
<p>也許有人認爲我這種解釋是神經過敏而過於寛縱的，因爲認定劇本作者無非是爲了適合威廉鮑衛爾的性格寫一個動人的故事，而偶然的採取了大盜爲題材罷了。然而我們總得相信藝術家决不會不加選擇的而採取題材，通過嚴密的思維之後的題材，便是作者自身思想的表現；所以威廉鮑衛爾在「女人與珍寳」和這一影片中，同樣是飾一個風流大盜，而先後二者却給人完全不同的印象了。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>除開這一點不說，那末編劇者對於劇本的創作，確是非常聰明的。一個是已經被判死刑的大盜，逍遙法外，而在海外再被捕，由香港押送回國正法。一個是害着極危險的心病，由醫生自香港保護回國。兩個人都是死前不久的人，而偏生一見傾心，於是在這生與死的内心衝突之下，彼此都祗得當未死之前，盡情享受最後的人生樂趣。在如此凄凉哀怨的情形之下，還怕没有好戲做嗎？還怕抓不住觀衆的感情嗎？</p>
<p>不消說，主人公便是那個大盜。那末現在再看劇作者是怎樣創作這一大盜的？</p>
<p>正如上面所述，劇作者對於主人公有着無限的同情。因爲如此，他正面的描寫他在生前刹那的悲哀，同時寫另一個小偷也是非常可笑而又非常可愛的。一方面，我們固然可看到有不少盜賊在不幸的伏法，同時也有不少的盜賊在不幸的産生，另一方面，作者並不直接說明，大盜犯罪的原因，而死刑旣經判定了，所謂罪狀已經在法律條文上載明了，又有什麽伸辯解釋的必要呢？</p>
<p>由於劇作者變態的怨恨，由於他對大盜過於同情，於是他將自由理想中的主人公寫成一個超人的英雄。死就死罷，算得什麽！所以第一次將偵探拖下海去，並不將他殺死而逃走，祗算給他一個警告，第二次已經完全凖備逃逸，却使其爲愛情而勇敢犧牲。自然，這些都是情理之外的事，可是於此却表現出作者的思想錯誤。此外他將小偷寫成一個可愛的酒鬼，將他寫成幼稚而天眞。他自身固然使人發笑，而他那冷冷的笑聲，却眞够正人君子們難受了。　　以消極的態度描寫現社會中人生的悲哀，我以爲劇作者的確是很美麗的做到了的。</p>
<p>至於戀愛至上主義的舖張，和一般的美國編劇人没有二樣，我想在這裏没有重覆提及的必要。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>由於威廉鮑衛爾和凱弗蘭茜絲表演的成功，以及導演手法的高强，我們可舉出以下各優點以說明導演的聰明。</p>
<p>（一）以香烟灰的長度，而記錄惰人們在石洞邊恩愛的時間。（二）小偷以一洋偷竊路人之皮包，結果爲空的。</p>
<p>（三）大盜留書情人時，配以單調而清幽的琴聲，完全表現當時内心的凄凉。</p>
<p>（四）舊金山已在目中時，很簡單的化出斷頭臺的畫面，說明主人公激烈的心情而又不露形於色。</p>
<p>（五）新年熱閙塲中，只以小偷一人把杯無語，此恨綿綿的詩意，完全襲上了觀衆的心頭。</p>
<p>其他一切美國影片所有的精美技巧，在本片中不必盡述。</p>
<h3>爲天一公司「靑春之火特刊」啟事</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>本月五日本刊上封面刊有天一公司的「靑春之火特刊」半幅。本來這並不是什麽值得大驚小怪的東西。至多說它没有標明是廣告，應該註出「本幅是廣告」幾箇字，是不是？乃勞許多同業的電影刊物小題大做起來，實在不安得很。</p>
<p>本刊編者當時本來也想聲明一下，</p>
<p>說明那是廣告部的事，不是電影專刊編輯部的事。一方旣未通知，一方亦無從過問。不過事後又想這事是用不着聲明的。高明的讀者，誰會相信那是本刊替天一公司編的特刊呢？</p>
<p>至於外邊種種流言蜚語，本刊一概不管。編者亦一概没有看過，也無從聲辯得。我願以最誠懇的態度，勸告大家，避免一切無謂無聊的糾紛，攻擊和爭競。奪了江山，也不過是一塲雞蟲得失，何必再在這字紙堆裏，大好的新年開筆戰呢？</p>
<h3>評「男性紅娘」</h3>
<p>— 逸羣</p>
<p>ＯIsen's　Big　Moment</p>
<p>假如人們都一致地承認：電影藝術只是一種給公子哥兒，太太小姐們，在茶餘酒後，當作消遣的東西，那麽，關於它的一切，自然用不着多說，更用不着我們來批評。但假如還有一部份人們，覺得電影，這東西，無論它的表現方式，是用喜劇或悲劇，文戲或武戲，愛情或滑稽劇··········至少應該包含着比較有意義的東西，來啓發觀衆，或警惕觀衆，以盡它對於社會小部份的責任，那麽，對於這個「男性紅娘」的滑稽劇，我覺得依然有批評指摘的必要。</p>
<p>固然，我們承認：滑稽劇製作，是具有許多客觀的不易解决的困難條件，如材料的搜集，表演的自然，材料與表演的眞實性等，實在是不容易討好的。可是，在製作者的主觀方面，我們相信，假如他能够深切地了解這電影藝術的社會用途，而肯於虚心地運用它，又未始不會産生出使人們滿意的東西來。</p>
<p>却利卓别麟，誰都知道，他的作品，所以能够很少無原則胡閙的理由，便是基於他能懂得這一電影藝術的用途。</p>
<p>相反地，我們在這部「男性紅娘」從銀幕上一片一片地幌過，一直到出了戲院的大門，什麽影響，却一點也得不到。　　雖然導演者Ｍalcolm　St　Clair對於一般的　技巧上的小動作，費了不少的大氣力，保持了一般美國戲的優點，可是，對於這故事本身的處理，却不能不呌人感到失望！這劇的主旨，本可從嫠婦樊氏爲羨慕羅伯的富豪，而勉强其女兒珍尼下嫁一點出發，去針砭一般不顧兒女終身幸福，只圖在財富上打主意的父母們，但他忽略了這一主要之點，凑合熱閙滑稽的塲面，不惜抓出一個十分兇狠的惡徒孟克，在大庭廣衆的酒肆中，居然恬不知恥的來壓逼羅伯與其妹結婚，而其他的人們，似都視若無覩，天下有這樣的事麽，······</p>
<p>其他勉强而不自然的地方，還很多，也不必一一細說了。</p>
<h3>又一華南新片「瓊島風雲」</h3>

<h3>歌壇雙絶The　Cat　and　the　Fiddle（一）</h3>
<p>— 墨塵</p>
<p>米高梅公司出品丨雷門諾伐羅琴妮麥唐娜合演</p>
<p>少年譜曲家維克多和舞臺經理道達，事先已經有了約，在五點鐘試他新編的歌曲。但是現在快要四點了，腦子裏面歌曲還没有來到。他腦子裏所有的不這樣的一個可笑的傻調，在迴旋地轉着：“Hi　diddle　diddle······The　Cat　and</p>
<p>the　Fiddle······　The　Cow　jumped　over　the　moon”這幾個字，在他肚子裏過是哼着，都快要成調了，可是他總想將那位少女亦譜進去。她的一雙媚眼···異樣的綠，像大海裏的深淵。她的金髮······如同日光普照了世界。晤，她的櫻唇呢······好像男子心中愛火燃燒一樣的紅。還有她的蹙眉·····要是她蹙着眉，還能這樣使人心碎的可愛，那她笑的時候，應該怎樣地呌人心塌地呢！她嬌嗔的時候，繊小的脚頓着，驕恣的頭仰着。應當爲她譜一曲情歌，斷不是潦草的鄙語俚詞可以了事的。</p>
<p>他是這樣遇見她的：他在急忙之中，要喚一輛街車。齊巧前面停了一輛，他急不暇擇地跳了進去，亦可以說跌了進去吧，不知道裏面已經有了一位女子端坐着。他看見了她，一時什麽都記不清了，祗知道那是生平所没有看見過的美麗女子。不久之前，他還想着世界上的一切，都靠着他和道達的試曲。但是現在什麽都無足輕重，祗有那個事前不知道在那裏的女子，是世上惟一的奇珍。他從她堆在脚底下的箱子上看見了她的名字呌先莉薛里丹······多末可愛的名字呀······先莉，幾幾乎和他她本人一樣可愛。她還是個美國人呢。他心裏自己推敲着她來到布魯塞爾做什麽的，他亦想看看她的嘴，能否彎着笑一笑。也突然間問道：「你相信不相信「一見傾心」的？」（未完）</p>

The Fujian leaders seem to want to fight to the death within the city walls. General opinion believes that if there is a decisive battle, the victory will belong to the Nanjing side because their forces are stronger and they have other advantages. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Fujian Troops in Gutian Negotiating Surrender</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Military news: I have just received a report from the front. The main force of the puppet 1st Army Corps and the puppet 14th Division from southern Jiangxi are currently entrenched in the Qidu, Yuyuan, and Wanchongxu areas. The main force of the puppet 3rd Army Corps seems to still be in a part of Jianning, in the Maodian Daping area southwest of Deshengguan.

<h3>Japanese Troops in Sanhe and Other Places</h3>
<p>Will Be Withdrawn Soon</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese troops who arrived in Sanhe and Jixian to defend against Liu Fei's forces will be completely withdrawn within three to four days after negotiations by Yin Rugeng. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng said: "I am scheduled to go to Tianjin this afternoon to negotiate with the provincial government and the Construction Department about repairing the telegraph and telephone lines in the war zone. The takeover plan for Gubeikou has been submitted to the authorities for review and approval. Once approved, we can start the process. The Japanese troops who entered Jixian and Sanhe will be withdrawn after negotiations. I plan to go on an inspection tour in the middle of this month." (9th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Liu Bandit Is Fleeing Towards Fucheng</h3>
<p>Suffering Heavy Losses from Ambushes by Local Militias Along the Way</p>
<p>Liu Jue Led His Troops to Hide in the Mountains of Southern Shandong</p>
<p>(Beiping) Over a thousand of Liu Fei's troops passed through the Gaochuan and Huaizhen areas yesterday, bypassing the Jiahe-Fucheng road and fleeing towards Fucheng County. They suffered heavy losses from ambushes by local militias along the way. Zhang Chengde and Bai Fengxiang's two cavalry divisions are still pursuing them. According to prisoners, Liu Jue led his troops back to Shandong, first gathering in Linqing, then bypassing the Grand Canal to Caozhou, and then heading to the mountains of southern Shandong to hide. He Zhuguo ordered all units to strictly guard against Liu Fei's troops. Xu Tingyao said that after Liu Fei's troops fled to Renqiu, they were pursued and have fled to Hejian. (9th) (Beiping) After Liu Fei's troops fled south, some engaged in battle with the local militia at the border between Renqiu and Xianxian. The majority have fled from Wen'an and Xianxian towards Shandong Province. The Military Sub-Committee has ordered Han to dispatch troops to intercept them. It is reported that Han has transferred Sun Tongxuan's division to northern Shandong to intercept them. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Puyi Will Issue a Declaration</h3>
<p>Japanese Side Will Also Release Text</p>
<p>(Beiping) Puyi is scheduled to proclaim himself emperor on March 1st and issue a declaration on February 25th. The Japanese are building an airfield in the Malan Yu area, but it is not large in scale and does not seem to be for military use. It may be for Puyi's future visits to the mausoleum. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The content and wording of the declaration under deliberation by the puppet state are extremely absurd. At the same time, the Japanese will also release text, avoiding the fact of armed aggression against the land of Northeast China and fabricating the beautiful name of assisting weak nations to deceive the world. It is rumored that after Puyi becomes emperor, the Japanese will have the puppet state adopt a federal system to centralize the puppet's power and reorganize the puppet army and police, which will be trained and guided by Japanese local soldiers. In the future, after training, they will be used as a vanguard against Russia. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhao Xinbo, the Minister of Justice of the puppet organization, and Ding Shiyuan, the puppet envoy to Japan, previously requested from the Japanese in Tokyo: 1. Protect Puyi's enthronement and restore the Great Qing Empire; 2. Recover the political power of the Great Qing. The Japanese considered the matter and concluded that it was too important and difficult to realize. At present, a Manchuria-Mongolia Empire could be established. Therefore, Zheng Xiaoxu, the Premier of the puppet state who was the strongest advocate for the restoration of the Great Qing Empire, has decided to suspend his trip to Japan because he has not been approved by the Japanese side. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Who to recommend as Puyi's tutor for his enthronement is currently under careful consideration. The most powerful candidate is the current Chief of the Bureau of Rituals, Hayashi Gonsuke. Although Mr. Hayashi's health is not as good as before, his knowledge and character are considered the most suitable. There is a possibility that he will be realized. If it is realized, the most vocal candidate for the post of Chief of the Bureau of Rituals is Matsudaira Tsuneo, the ambassador to the United Kingdom. (9th Electric News)</p>
<h3>Japanese Actively Plan To</h3>
<p>Control All of Manchuria's Finances</p>
<p>Planning to Establish the Xingye Bank with a Capital of Ten Million</p>
<p>Mitsui Zaibatsu Invests in Puppet Capital Construction</p>
<p>Kwantung Army Does Not Relax Immigration Policy</p>
<p>(Changchun) The Ministry of Finance of the puppet state intends to improve financial institutions. It has formulated a banking law to control and manage all banks in Manchuria. In addition to the Central Bank, it is also planning to establish the Manchuria Xingye Bank with a capital of ten million. The Xingye Banking Law was drafted in August last year, so it can be established by June at the latest. It has established a three-year plan to establish a financial combination in each county, with a total of 200 financial combinations in Manchuria. This year, the financial combination will be set up in 22 major locations. (9th Electric News)</p>
<p>(Changchun) This time, Mitsui &amp; Co. will invest 10 million gold to develop "Manchukuo." Directors and technicians will soon be dispatched to Manchuria for investigation. The Kwantung Army Special Service Department and the Puppet Capital Construction Bureau are currently drafting a plan for the construction of the puppet capital. The investment aims at construction projects, water control, water supply, and immigration. In the future, the puppet capital of Changchun will become a city with a population of one million. (9th Electric News)</p>
<p>(Changchun) The Kwantung Army issued a statement regarding the issue of Japanese immigration today, as follows: It is rumored that the results of the Kwantung Army's armed immigration are very poor, and most of the veterans have deserted, making the immigration unreliable. The Kwantung Army is still implementing the original plan. The beautiful fields along the Lafa-Harbin and Changtu roads are very suitable for Japanese immigrants. Group immigration or free immigration can be carried out. An immigration training center is still being set up in Gongzhuling to train immigrants, which proves that the Kwantung Army has not relaxed its immigration policy. (9th China United News)</p>
<h3>Shorten Sailing Time Between Japan and Manchuria</h3>
<p>(Changchun) Due to the opening of the Jingtu Line, the transport of goods on the North Korean shipping route, which is the shortest distance between Japan and "Manchuria," has recently increased. The North Japan Steamship Company has added the sister ship Shintaka Maru to the existing regular ships Manchuria Maru and Amakusa Maru to ease the situation. According to the new route and time schedule revised from January of this year, the ship that departs from Chongjin for Tsuruga every ten days on the 6th, 16th, and 26th at 7:00 PM will be advanced by three hours to depart at 4:00 PM. It will arrive in Tsuruga at 8:00 AM the next morning, and can catch the express train to Tokyo that departs at 9:10 AM that day. Therefore, it can shorten the time to Tokyo Station by eight hours and forty minutes, making it very convenient for passengers traveling to Tokyo. (9th Electric News)</p>

<h3>Puyi's Usurpation Makes the Far East More Dangerous. Be Vigilant.</h3>
<p>Since the puppet "Manzhou" state was created by the Japanese, and Puyi was manufactured by the Japanese to be its puppet, the Japanese have been using Puyi and the historical connections of Manzhou in order to temporarily bring order to the three northeastern provinces. They made him the ruler of this non-descript puppet state. Furthermore, for the convenience of their military actions, they used Puyi to sign the so-called Japan-Manzhou Agreement in order to fulfill their ambitions of stationing troops wherever they pleased within "Manzhou". At the same time, they ordered thousands of Japanese to falsely claim dual citizenship, working as political spies and military informants for Japan on the one hand, and taking on key positions in the puppet state on the other, implementing a plan to seize real political power and directly control all of the puppet state's administration. However, this kind of situation has two major disadvantages for the Japanese imperialist invasion:</p>
<p>First, the three northeastern provinces are Chinese territory. Historical facts are present. No one can damage historical facts with false testimony. The 30 million people of the Northeast are all Han Chinese. This is an indelible piece of ironclad evidence. Although there were different treatments for Manchus and Hans in the former Qing Dynasty, the Manchus have almost assimilated with the Hans in the past century. Not only is there no need to separate from the Han nationality, but there are also absolutely no traces of struggles similar to those between various European nations. Furthermore, the language and writing are completely the same. All European and American powers have clearly recognized this matter. Even the Lytton Commission's report confirmed that Japan's launch of the September 18th Incident was the beginning of a military invasion. Although the League of Nations is powerless to sanction it, it has jointly denied the illegality of its aggressive behavior. Recently, all have strengthened their defenses against Japan. This is its disadvantage. Second, the United States and Britain are far across the ocean and plagued by the global economic panic. Therefore, during this recent period, apart from slightly limiting it economically and increasing tariffs on goods exported to Japan, they can no longer express themselves politically in an intense manner. Armed conflict will not suddenly materialize. However, Japan's attempt to annex the three northeastern provinces, that is, the implementation of its so-called continental policy, is focused on dealing with the Soviet Union with all its strength. Since Japan occupied northern Manchuria, the conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union has become increasingly acute. Although it may not immediately lead to war, it is already universally acknowledged that a war will eventually be unavoidable. If Japan uses the puppet organization for a long time, it will be difficult to operate flexibly in politics, and military affairs will inevitably be constrained. This is another disadvantage. Furthermore, Japan believes that using this kind of puppet state has not yet resulted in manipulation as desired, and Puyi has recently often sighed, repeatedly requesting to return to Tianjin to live his life as a figurehead. The Japanese therefore feel that the use of manipulation is sometimes exhausted. It would be more convenient to accelerate the realization of its annexation policy. Furthermore, Japan has long advocated the "Japan-Manchuria Controlled Economy." If the puppet state really existed, then the so-called opposition between the Japanese financial cliques, warlords, and bureaucrats in the three northeastern provinces could never be eliminated, which means that its control would never be fully realized. If it wanted to reap the real benefits of immigration in the three northeastern provinces, and if it wanted to use the three northeastern provinces to make up for its domestic economic panic, it was feared that it would eventually become a fantasy. So it actively transformed, forcing public opinion, ordering Puyi to become emperor, and making Manchuria quickly become a second Korea. From a military point of view, more than 130,000 Japanese troops are stationed in the Northeast. It is already sufficient to use them to prevent the activities of the volunteer army and to suppress the puppet state. If they are used to deal with its imaginary enemy, the Soviet Union, it is greatly insufficient. If puppet politics continues to exist, then the puppet state's army will inevitably remain. These types of troops are dependent on the puppet state only to seek food and clothing. Once an international incident occurs, it is clear that they cannot be used by Japan. Therefore, the Japanese financial cliques take advantage of the time before a great war to first resolve the puppet state, from an imperial system to a vassal state. Today, the puppet state in the Northeast will become tomorrow's Yi Wang of Korea. After the September 18th Incident, we entered a reverse management situation. There was a crisis in the three northern provinces, which were in danger of falling into the same situation as Korea. Unfortunately, we are now in the midst of this. I fear that after Puyi's usurpation is realized, the puppet state will soon cede the country. The title of Commander of the Kwantung Army will soon be the name of a supervisor. We do not believe this. Please open your eyes and wait and see.</p>
<h3>Zhang Peiyuan</h3>
<p>Killed by Sniping, Details</p>
<p>Liu Sheng Telegraphs Report to Nanjing</p>
<p>(Nanjing) I have just received a telegram from Xinjiang Chairman Liu Wenlong and Border Defense Commissioner Sheng Shicai Yu (6th) reporting that Yili Reclamation Envoy Zhang Peiyuan was killed by sniping. The original telegram said, "(Omissions). I have repeatedly presented Zhang Peiyuan, the Yili Reclamation Envoy, to the central government, recommending that he be appointed as Assistant to the Xinjiang Border Defense Commissioner and a member of the Provincial Government, as well as the Commander of the 8th Division, in order to work together to stabilize the border situation. However, Zhang Peiyuan was blinded by greed and consistently disobeyed the orders of the new government, making demands and obstructing the bandit suppression plan. In December of last year, he instigated his troops to occupy Usu without reason, disrupting the traffic between Dihua, Yili, and Tacheng, and colluding with Ma bandits to divide his forces and attack Suita, attempting to overthrow the government. I was saddened by the people's suffering and did not want to engage in military conflict, so I sent Xing Zhanqing, the commander of the provincial capital's city defense, Xi Shichang, the chief secretary of the governor's office, and Lu Chu, a secretary of the provincial government, to Yili overnight to mediate. If the matter could be resolved, I would not hesitate to compromise. However, the representatives were detained upon arriving in Yili, the initial attack on Tacheng started a military campaign. The situation escalated. Fortunately, the people hated the rebellion, and the officers and soldiers deeply understood the importance of righteousness. All troops north to Tacheng and west to the Usu area of Suishu completely surrendered. Due to the emptiness of defenses in Yili, internal conflicts suddenly arose. All sectors revolted together. Zhang Peiyuan, seeing that he was deserted and unable to stop it, led only thirty or forty Mongolian cavalry and fled in panic. He was attacked and killed by an angry mob forty li away from Huiyuan City. Wang Zhizuo, the Yili Administrative Director, maintained order. The military and civilians obeyed, and peace was as usual. I have sent Liu Bin, the Western Route Garrison Commander, to temporarily serve as the Yili Reclamation Envoy and the Yili Garrison Commander to take office and maintain order. However, Zhang Peiyuan held four important positions and received great favor from the state. He was killed by an angry mob, and it was his own fault. Fortunately, due to the power of the central government and the happiness of the military and civilians, the local area is peaceful. I am deeply grateful. I am currently handling the aftermath to consolidate the western defenses and alleviate my concerns. In addition to reporting at any time, I am sending this telegram. Liu Wenlong, Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial Government, and Sheng Shicai, Border Defense Commissioner of Xinjiang, bowed. (6th) (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

A portion of the fundamental engineering work and temporary engineering work in this project were handled by the Economic Committee, which would unify power over the matter. However, the project urgently needs to continue, but the Committee's fundamental measures have not been decided in a timely manner, and it is difficult to wait for a long time. The temporary engineering and extended surtax case after the closure of the Hai River Reorganization Association has been discussed by the internal, external, and financial ministries, and a decision has been made on the method. It seems that the original plan can still be followed to avoid delays. Resolution: Approved according to the review opinion.</p>
<p>(2) Finance Minister Kong and Industry Minister Chen reported on the case of establishing the Shanghai Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau. The review opinion was that this case is related to the relief of rural agriculture and the regulation of grain prices, and it seems that preparatory stock offerings can be temporarily approved. However, the amendments to the articles of association should be submitted to the competent authority by the bureau in accordance with the Company Law. As for the central government's allocation of funds, this can also be handled by the Ministry of Finance, but a separate application should be submitted and not included in the articles of association in order to comply with common practice. Resolution: Approved for handling according to the review opinion.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Industry Orders Construction</h3>
<p>Seven New-Style Fishing Vessels</p>
<p>All Can Be Completed in the Second Half of the Year</p>
<p>To Be Commanded by the Fishery Protection Office</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Industry has abolished the Fishery Administration Bureaus and Fishery Improvement Committees of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hebei, Shandong, Fujian, and Guangdong, and established a Fishery Protection Office in Shanghai, which has begun operations. It is found that the original four fishing vessels, Hai'ou, Haiying, Haigu, and Biaohai, in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas are dispatched to protect fisheries due to frequent pirate attacks on fishing boats in the Shengshan fishing area. The two fishing vessels belonging to the Hebei and Shandong areas are currently docked in Qingdao and will soon be under the jurisdiction of the office. The fishing vessels belonging to the Fujian and Guangdong areas were originally leased merchant ships for application. Now that they have been reorganized, other methods should be devised. The Ministry of Industry has specially ordered seven new fishing vessels from the German Xiwang Company. The original planned price was 1.5 million yuan, but it has now increased to 2 million yuan due to the installation of small steel cannons and fishing machines. All the projects can be completed in the second half of the year, and they will be driven to China and incorporated into the command of the Fishery Protection Office. Among them, there is a new-style equipped fishing vessel, costing 500,000 yuan, which is specially for guiding the improvement of fishery administration. (9th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>Proposals from Various Parties at the Fourth Plenary Session</h3>
<p>Being Sorted by the Central Government</p>
<p>(Nanjing) President of the Executive Yuan Wang answered interviewers: (1) The proposals from various aspects of the Fourth Plenary Session have all been submitted to the Central Government and are currently being sorted out. (2) The Standing Committee of the Central Committee has many opinions on the Fourth Plenary Session, and the Secretariat is drafting proposals, which can be completed within a few days.

<h3>President Wang</h3>
<p>Meets with Representatives from Shandong Province</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Zhaoming met with Tang Xiang, the representative of Shandong Province in Nanjing, on the morning of the 9th, and inquired in detail about the political situation in Shandong Province and Feng Yuxiang's recent whereabouts. (9th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain newspaper reported a few days ago that Feng Yuxiang arrived in Ping with his family on the 5th. Reporters inquired from all parties and said that it was not true. According to Jiang Menglin, the president of Peking University who arrived in Beijing yesterday, he did not hear about Feng's arrival in Ping when he was in Ping. Ge Dingyuan, the representative of Song Zheyuan in Beijing, told reporters that he had not received such a report recently, and it was probably not true. (9th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>Mongolian Representatives</h3>
<p>Visit Wang Dai and Others Today</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Mongolian representatives are scheduled to visit Wang Zhaoming, Dai Chuanxian, Huang Shaoxiong, and Shi Qingyang on the 1st to request the early promulgation of the district government organization law so that preparations can be made for establishment to consolidate the border. According to representative Nasenderleger, the Mongolian princes are deeply aware of the righteousness and support the Central Government. They have long been aware of Japan's coercive methods, knowing that it is the old trick of annexing Korea, and will never blindly follow suit. Now the Mongolian people's knowledge has been opened, and the feudal system has long been despised by the Mongolian people. Even if the Japanese puppets use coercive methods to carry out aggression, the Mongolian desert is all over the place, the roads are rugged, and the villages are sparse, making it difficult for airplanes and cannons to be effective. Now the only important thing is to establish an autonomous government, unite internally, train cavalry, implement economic construction, and develop a strong and powerful autonomous government. Even if the Japanese are cunning, they may find it difficult to implement their tricks. (9th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Zhao Bulian Arrives in Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Mongolian Life and Culture Should Be Improved</p>
<p>Shanxi Is Now Peaceful and Actively Constructing</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhao Bulian returned to Beijing on the 9th, saying that the environment in Inner Mongolia is harsh, which is a great concern for the country. The Bailingmiao Conference only brought the current issues to a temporary end. The Mongols' intention to lean towards the Central Government is very sincere. The autonomous governments of the various banners of Inner Mongolia should be prepared for establishment as soon as possible to unite and resist foreign aggression. The Japanese proposal to move the puppet capital to Jehol in an attempt to induce and threaten Mongolia is noteworthy. The situation in Shanxi is normal, and Yan is very concerned about the Fujian Incident. It is not certain whether Yan will come to Beijing during the Plenary Session. (9th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhao Bulian arrived at Pukou at 8:00 a.m. on the 9th, and more than 30 officials from the Mongolian Committee went to meet him. After Zhao rested after crossing the river, he went to visit President Wang and Chairman Shi. According to reports, he followed Minister Huang to inspect and comfort Mongolia, and the results were satisfactory. Mongolia has a vast territory and a sparse population, and its living habits are very different from those of the inland. Its culture is also backward, and it urgently needs assistance for improvement. Now representatives from various leagues have come to Beijing, but the representatives from Xilin Gol League have not all come. The date of Zhangjia's entry into Mongolia has not been determined. Yan Xishan is dedicated to construction in Shanxi. The Tongpu Railway from Taiyuan to Jiexiu is being built by soldiers and will be completed soon. It will be open to traffic in March or April. People have also been sent to survey the branch road from Baigui to Jincheng. Shanxi is now peaceful, but the rural economy is difficult, and methods are being devised to relieve it.

<h3>Tibetan Representative in Beijing</h3>
<p>Denies the Reincarnation of the Dalai Lama</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Tibetan representative in Beijing denied the claim that the successor Dalai Lama has been reincarnated in Lhasa, and said that he has received repeated telegrams from Tibet stating that this matter was not mentioned and that it was probably the result of propaganda from a certain party.

<h3>Non-Recognition of Puppet Organizations</h3>
<p>Is an Iron Rule of Diplomacy</p>
<p>Talk by Diplomatic Authorities</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Recently, in order to strengthen its military, political, and economic power in the Northeast, Japan plans to support the puppet Puyi to formally become emperor and change the puppet "Manchukuo" to the so-called "Man-Mongolia State," and it is widely rumored that it will be formally established on March 1. A Central News Agency reporter asked the diplomatic authorities about this matter on the 9th. According to reports, in order to fulfill its ambition to annex the Northeast, Japan used traitors to play puppet shows and supported Puyi to become emperor, which was nothing more than a new trick in the puppet show. However, the Japanese attitude towards this is also inconsistent. Those who support this claim that after Puyi becomes emperor, it can further expand Japan's strength in the Northeast, consolidate its Man-Mongolia rule, and further deceive international friends by saying that the Manchukuo puppet organization has nothing to do with Japan. The opposition party is deeply afraid that after Puyi becomes emperor, the puppet's power will expand, making it difficult to control. In the future, it will inevitably be difficult to abolish the puppet. As for our government, non-recognition of puppet organizations is an iron rule of diplomacy, and whether Puyi becomes emperor or not, this attitude will always be adhered to.

<h3>Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>To Hold a Provisional Meeting</p>
<p>To Discuss the Internal Organization of Various Ministries</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Due to the numerous affiliated agencies of the various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan, which not only makes it difficult to handle affairs flexibly, but also wastes national currency, it is planned to reorganize the internal organization of the ministries, appropriately merge redundant agencies, and hold a provisional meeting in the Yuan on the 12th of this month to discuss the internal organization methods of the ministries, compile opinions from all parties, and submit proposals to the Fourth Plenary Session for resolution and implementation.

<h3>Internal Draft</h3>
<p>Performance Appraisal and Reward Regulations</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The councilors and directors of the Ministry of Interior drafted four items of performance appraisal and reward regulations: (1) Those with excellent performance will be promoted one grade appropriately. (2) If the promoted grade has reached the maximum limit, the monthly salary will be increased by 10% to 20% appropriately.

<h3>Japanese Consulate General Reception</h3>

<p>(Nanjing) Japanese Seventh Fleet Commander Imamura came to Beijing. The Japanese Consulate General in Beijing held a tea party from 5:00 to 7:00 p.m. on the 9th and invited our country's ministry chiefs and diplomatic personnel from various countries stationed in Beijing. Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Zhaoming, Deputy Minister Tang Youren, Zeng Zhongming, Chen Yi, etc., all attended. (9th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Kim Seok Arrest Case</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Is Negotiating</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Deputy Foreign Minister Tang Youren said that the two countries have different interpretations of Kim Seok's nationality. The Japanese side claims that Kim is not Chinese, but in fact, he has legally acquired Chinese nationality according to his father, and the Ministry of Interior has records to prove it. Therefore, there is no doubt that Kim Seok is Chinese, and Japan must not illegally arrest him. The Ministry is currently negotiating on this matter. (9th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Imposing Inheritance Tax</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Still Needs to Consider</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance believes that our country lacks investigation of family estates, registration has not been carried out, and the public rarely implements wills, so the matter of imposing inheritance tax is still under consideration. (9th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the Ministry of Finance, the Taxation Department drafted a draft of the inheritance tax issue and submitted it to Kong Xiangxi for review. Regarding the issue of collection, it is first necessary to start with household registration investigation. In the past, our country has never had accurate statistics on people's property. It is generally believed that it is not yet the time to create this tax. In short, if the government does levy taxes, it is feared that the national property will be secretly deposited in foreign banks, while the government will actually receive very little, and the people's money will invisibly overflow. Therefore, it has been decided to shelve it temporarily and consider it later after research. However, the income tax is still in the planning stage. (9th)</p>
<h3>Gan Yun Escorted to Suzhou for Trial</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After Gan Yun, the former party director of Fujian Province, was arrested, the prosecutor's office of the Ningde Court investigated him once. Considering that Gan was guilty of reactionary crimes and the circumstances were serious, it was decided to transfer jurisdiction. Approved by the High Court, Shi Renbing and bailiffs were dispatched by the District Court on the 9th to escort Gan Yun and all the documents to Suzhou. (9th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>Roosevelt Organizes</h3>
<p>Cabinet of Scientists</p>
<p>Consultations with the Government on Agricultural Issues</p>
<p>The Mint Buys Large Amounts of Silver</p>
<p>International Currency Price Negotiations Underway</p>
<p>(New York) The New York Times reported that President Roosevelt has organized a "Cabinet of Scientists," whose members are selected from various scientific institutions. Their duties are to provide government consultations on specialized issues such as agricultural meteorology. (9th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau stated that within a week after President Roosevelt announced the minting order, the mint had purchased 11,570,000 ounces of silver. The Treasury Department purchased government bonds worth $44,713,000 last week. It has been seven weeks since the policy of purchasing government bonds was implemented, and the amount purchased last week was the largest. The gold purchased by the Financial Rehabilitation Corporation has now exceeded $75 million, of which domestic gold is valued at $20,887,000. (8th Reuters Telegram) (Washington) New York newspapers telegraphed today that although President Roosevelt claimed to other countries that he was not yet prepared to negotiate currency price security, these international negotiations are currently underway. According to the Financial Times, President Roosevelt's strategy is misunderstood by many, so public opinion is very complicated on how currency stability can be achieved. Wall Street believes that President Roosevelt will begin to reduce the price of the dollar and use a portion of the 4 trillion budget allocated to the Financial Rehabilitation Corporation as a currency stability fund. The Financial Times also stated that the dollar's credit must be restored before the necessary funds for the budget proposal can be obtained. (8th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>US Congressman Proposes</h3>
<p>Building 101 Warships</p>
<p>(Washington) Republican Congressman Britten from Illinois proposed in the House of Representatives today to allocate $482 million US dollars to manufacture 101 warships. Britten is a member of the Naval Committee. He said that this proposal does not conflict with President Roosevelt's naval plan. He plans to build 101 warships in four years from 1935 to 1939. In the first year, two cruisers, two destroyer motherships, twelve destroyers, and six submarines must be built. Britten also said that this move can meet the 553 regulations of the Naval Conference, making the US naval power equal to that of the UK and above that of Japan. The United States is scheduled to build 102 warships by 1939, costing approximately $560 million US dollars. Currently, Japan is building ships in full compliance with the naval conference restrictions, while the UK is only 61 ships less than the naval conference limit. (8th National Telegram)</p>

<h3>Russian Ambassador Visits Hirota</h3>
<p>Demands Release of Railway Staff</p>
<p>Prerequisite for Reopening Railway Sales Negotiations</p>
<p>(Tokyo) As a result of yesterday's visit by the Soviet Russian ambassador to Foreign Minister Hirota, there is hope for the reopening of negotiations on the transfer of the East Railway. The Soviet Russian side is taking the release of the arrested Soviet Russian employees as a prerequisite.

The prospect of reopening negotiations is promising. (9th Dentong Telegram)</p>

<h3>Britain Fully Supports the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Even if Japan and Germany Withdraw, Other Countries Will Surely Join</p>
<p>Germany Requests Clarification of French Memorandum</p>
<p>(London) Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Eden, delivered a speech today in Alcester, Warwickshire, discussing the valuable results Foreign Secretary Simon obtained during his recent trip to Paris and Rome. He stated that the Italian and British governments have agreed to prioritize disarmament before reforming the League of Nations, a guarantee that is particularly welcome. Eden also mentioned the withdrawal of Japan and Germany from the League of Nations, saying that he believes 1934 will see an increase in the number of League members and the maintenance of the League's full authority. Britain must use its entire strength and authority to uphold this organization, as the League is the most solid shield for peace. If the League of Nations Covenant is difficult to amend, then a determination must be made to further consolidate the League and make it more suitable for its mission. (8th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Director of the League of Nations Disarmament Section, Mr. Archer, went to London today to confer with the Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, Mr. Henderson, on the procedures for the Disarmament Conference to convene. There is much speculation about this trip. It is generally believed that the Disarmament Conference will not reconvene immediately after the League of Nations Council meeting from January 15th to 20th, as the overall situation is still unclear and the difficulties faced by the Disarmament Conference remain the same as in November of last year. It is expected that unless the negotiations among the politicians participating in the Council meeting yield significant results, Britain and Italy will propose postponing the Disarmament Conference until February or March. (9th National Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Foreign Ministry Committee is currently encountering obstacles regarding the French memorandum and will ask France to explain the unclear points. It is reported that Germany will reject France's proposal to reduce its air force by half, as it is conditional on retaining the reduced portion for future international air force use. In that case, it would still be under French command. (8th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Berlin) A semi-official political correspondence report stated that Germany cannot respond to the French memorandum for a considerable period of time because the reply involves very important political and technical aspects and cannot be made without detailed consideration. The report also said that Germany has always firmly believed that disarmament issues are better resolved through direct negotiations between the countries concerned. If the Disarmament Conference proceeds, there is less hope for success. The German government will submit a new list of questions to Paris, asking France to fully explain the meaning of its armament proposals in the memorandum. (8th Havas)</p>
<h3>British Foreign Office Receives</h3>
<p>Italian Disarmament Proposal</p>
<p>Maintaining the Stance of the Rome Conference</p>
<p>(London) This morning, the British Foreign Office received Italy's new disarmament proposal. Officials have adopted a silent attitude towards this proposal. It is said that the gist of the Italian proposal is that it acknowledges that this disarmament conference may not be entirely satisfactory. Italy has also expressed its abandonment of the complete abolition of fighter planes, as at least some of these weapons must be preserved. The points mentioned in the Italian proposal have been largely agreed upon by the major powers and can be resolved after individual meetings. The British side must wait until the Disarmament Committee meeting on Wednesday before submitting it to the Cabinet for detailed discussion and drafting a proposal. At the same time, the Cabinet will also study Germany's response to France's disarmament proposal. According to sources close to the Foreign Office, this new Italian proposal is based on the results of the recent talks between Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and British Foreign Secretary Simon in Rome. (8th National News Agency)</p>
<p>Rome The Italian Foreign Ministry authorities declared to reporters that the Italian government had not issued any proposals to Britain.

<h3>Tragic Accident While Seeing Off New Recruits</h3>
<p>Kyoto Station in Japan Becomes a Living Hell</p>
<p>Crowd Falls from the Platform One After Another</p>
<p>82 Dead, 64 Seriously and Lightly Injured</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a semi-official report today, a tragic accident occurred at Kyoto Station last night, with 71 deaths and 56 serious injuries. The incident occurred when many passengers were walking across the overpass to the station. Due to the large number of people, it was extremely crowded. The passengers who were first to step off the bridge suddenly lost their footing and fell, and the rest of the crowd could not stand and fell forward, resulting in countless people being trampled. Thus, a tragedy occurred. The crowd had come to the station to say goodbye to the newly recruited reinforcements of the Navy. (9th Reuters)</p>
<p>Kyoto Regarding the incident at Kyoto Station caused by seeing off the naval corps recruits, as of noon today, it is known that there are 82 deaths, including 7 recruits, and 64 seriously and lightly injured. In addition, the rising entertainer Shizue Hara was also seriously injured. (9th Den-tsu)</p>
<h3>The Course of the Disaster</h3>
<p>Kyoto Yesterday at Kyoto Station a great tragedy occurred with dozens dead and hundreds seriously and lightly injured, unprecedented in history. That is, yesterday at 8:00 PM, over 6,000 people had gathered at the station to see off more than 6,000 soldiers being sent to the Kure Naval Corps on a special train, the station was extremely crowded and chaotic. In the midst of this confusion, people on the overpass were pushed off the platform, falling one after another, crushing each other, and in an instant over 150 people had fallen, resulting in dozens of tragic deaths and over a hundred serious and light injuries. The station instantly turned into hell, the cries for help were unbearable. Various public and private hospitals in the city, upon receiving the news, immediately dispatched ambulances and rescue teams, but as it was late at night and order within the station had broken down, they were unable to cope. The number of dead and injured being carried into various hospitals only increased. Although the authorities worked hard to rescue them, according to investigations as of 3:00 AM this morning, there were 70 dead and 59 seriously and lightly injured. (9th Den-tsu)</p>
<p>Kyoto Last night, when the Kure Naval Corps new recruits for this year were departing from Kyoto to Kure, a major tragedy occurred with many deaths and injuries. That is, the new recruits for this year recruited from various regions, 217 from the Kyoto district, 150 from the Kanazawa district, 69 from the Toyama district, 101 from the Tsuruga district, and 97 from the Fukui district, gathered at Kyoto Station at 10:00 PM last night to wait for their train to depart. At that time, over 10,000 members of the public who came to see them off also arrived at the station, so the station was very crowded and there was barely any room to stand. At 10:20 PM, someone seeing them off on the third platform was pushed over, and the people behind them did not notice what had happened and kept pushing forward, causing countless people to fall one after another. The new recruits standing on the platform were also pushed onto the railway tracks, with the people behind piling on top of those in front. As a result, the order was completely disrupted, and the station suddenly turned into a living hell. Everyone was scrambling to escape, but the more they struggled, the more chaotic it became, leading to 75 deaths and over 100 injuries. Most of them were veterans, but there were also over 30 women among them. (9th Japan United News)</p>
<h3>Responsibility for the Tragedy</h3>
<p>Kyoto The Kyoto Military Police Captain, Mr. Kishi, who was directing the crowd and maintaining order at the station when the tragedy occurred, told reporters, "It is extremely regrettable that this tragedy occurred so suddenly and could not be prevented. The station authorities misjudged whether or not people had platform tickets and allowed a large number of people to crowd into the station. This is the root cause of the tragedy. The authorities should have first found a way to maintain order, because everyone who came to see off the new recruits today had been drinking, which also contributed to the expansion of the incident."

<h3>Mussolini</h3>
<p>Hostile to Japan</p>
<p>Rome Expresses Support for Soviet Russia</p>
<p>(London) Recently, the Italian Navy Department submitted a report to the Chamber of Deputies on the naval budget, in which it expressed concern about the expansion of the Japanese navy and the expansion of Japanese territory. Although the British government has not expressed any opinion on this report, political figures have greatly criticized it and compared it to the speech recently delivered by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini at the Asian University Students Association, because Mussolini's speech is a slight indication that Italy is increasingly hostile to Japan. There are three reasons why people here believe that Italy opposes Japan: (1) Italy wants to maintain its naval prestige and is jealous of the expansion of the Japanese navy. (2) Since Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov's recent visit to Rome, Italian-Soviet relations have become increasingly friendly. Soviet Russia has expressed its dissatisfaction with Japan's westward expansion. This expression from Rome is to help Soviet Russia. (3) According to the News Chronicle this morning, Japan's attention is focused on Italian Eritrea and Abyssinia in East Africa, and Japanese businesses are actively making progress in these places. The extremely conservative faction in Britain deeply sympathizes with Italy's fear of Japan invading Italian East Africa and has mentioned this in the House of Commons, saying that Japanese businesses have already occupied a considerable market share in British East Africa and that Britain must find ways to stop their progress.

<h3>India Increases Tariffs on Sundries</h3>
<p>Japanese Merchants Discuss Countermeasures</p>
<p>Urging the Government to Strive for Negotiations</p>
<p>Osaka Yesterday at 2:00 PM, Japanese merchants held a major meeting on countermeasures against India's tariff increase at the Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Over 50 representatives from various businesses such as underwear, rubber, ceramics, glass, and umbrellas attended. They strongly criticized the Indian government for increasing tariffs on sundries, which would fatally harm Japanese sundries merchants, and because it would also lead to increased unemployment, they demanded that the government protest to the Indian authorities, asking India to reduce tariffs by 50%, and telegraphed Representative Sawada to fight to the end. If the Indian side does not show sincerity, they will demand that the government implement retaliatory tariffs. (9th China United News)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Indian government increased tariffs on sundries on December 23rd of last year, with the aim of resisting Japanese goods. The Japanese government has protested to India several times. The Indian Commercial Officer, Mr. Park, also agreed on the 8th to consider it. The Japanese government is actively requesting that a special meeting on sundries be held around the 20th of this month. Ambassador Sawada and the sundries representatives have also decided not to return home for the time being and to participate in the meeting. However, if it has not been resolved by the time Ambassador Sawada returns to Japan in early February, Consul-General Miyake Tetsuichiro in Calcutta will be responsible for handling everything.

Ambassador Saito will go to the United States after these negotiations are concluded. (9th Japan United News)</p>

<p>Colonial Minister Resigns, Judge Suspected</p>
<p>Premier Doumergue Undertakes Major Reform of the Police System</p>
<p>The Whole Country Petitions for a Thorough Investigation or Else a Tax Strike</p>
<p>(Paris) Stavisky, the perpetrator of the French scandal that caused a sensation for a time, has now made a dramatically ironic ending. He rented a villa in the foothills of Mont Blanc, and after the incident came to light, he had been hiding there. He was disturbed when the police arrived on his trail. Upon hearing the sound of police officers banging on the door, he raised his gun and killed himself.</p>
<p>Since Sunday, Paris's well-known criminologist had obtained an important lead in a winter resort area, but Stavisky was very cunning, and it was not until noon on Sunday that his lair was detected. A very strict security net was then laid in the area, and then they went to knock on the door, announcing the purpose of their visit. However, the only response from inside the room was a gunshot, which was quickly suppressed. The police then broke down the door and entered, and the great con man of the era lay prostrate on the ground, a pistol placed beside him, and smoke still visible from the barrel. The police initially thought he was dead, but the doctor said that he was still breathing, but it was only for a few hours longer, as the place where he was shot was the brain.</p>
<h3>People of the Whole Country</h3>
<p>Petition for a Thorough Investigation</p>
<p>The political storm caused by this person is still surging. Today, the National Taxpayers' Association submitted another petition to the government, stating that the nation's honor and morality have reached a critical state, and the government should quickly find ways to ensure that all those who are even slightly involved in this case or have benefited from it are subject to judicial judgment. This petition is nothing less than an appeal to the authorities, because it concludes by stating that if the government does not make every effort to thoroughly investigate this case, so that the criminals receive their due punishment and the lost assets are restored, the association will instruct tens of millions of taxpayers across the country to refuse to pay national taxes.</p>

<h3>Prime Offender in Fraud Case</h3>
<p>Ends His Crimes with a Bullet</p>
<p>Chamonix Stavisky, the prime offender in the Bayonne fraud case, died of his injuries at 3:50 this morning. Since the case occurred, the police have been searching in all directions and have confirmed that Stavisky had been hiding in Sevaux from December 28 to January 2. In February, he went to Megève with a friend by car, but was eventually tracked down by the police. The police were about to enter the room to arrest him when they suddenly heard a gunshot. They opened the door and saw Stavisky lying in a pool of blood, shot in the head. The bullet entered through the right temple and exited through the left temple. All the doctors in the town were immediately summoned to provide aid, but he was already dying, and only lived for two hours. If surgery had been performed immediately, his life could have been saved, but the nearest surgeon lived forty miles away, so nothing could be done. A Reuters reporter witnessed Stavisky being carried out of his residence on a sickbed. Stavisky was lying on it, motionless, with blood still flowing from his head. It seemed he had not groomed himself for two or three days, but his clothes were still as neat as usual. The Paris Morning News recalled that Stavisky's father had shot himself in the Fontainebleu forest on June 28, 1926, as he preferred to die rather than testify in court to his son's disadvantage. Today, a newspaper employee related to Stavisky testified in the Bayonne court, stating that Stavisky had attempted suicide a week earlier to avoid being caught in the legal net. Stavisky was mentally exhausted at the time, playing with a pistol, muttering to himself, "They cannot get me alive."</p>
<h3>Premier Doumergue</h3>
<p>Announces Reform of the Police System</p>
<p>Since the Bayonne case occurred, Premier Doumergue has announced the reform of the police system. The national police affairs will be under the full authority of the Director of Detectives, and the Paris Police Headquarters will no longer be an independent agency, and will take on a secondary role in the future. This move is likely to cause great shock to the residents of Paris, who have never liked the Directorate of Detectives and worship the current Paris Police Chief, Chabert, as an idol. Another reform is that savings banks will be given greater protection, and the county magistrates will be strictly supervised to avoid the repeated postponements of lawsuits and to prevent the various malpractices exposed by the Bayonne fraud case from happening again. (9th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Cabinet held a meeting to discuss the Stavisky fraud case. After the meeting, a press release was issued, stating that Premier Doumergue declared that he would not allow any obstruction to the progress of judicial procedures. He will submit several bills to the Cabinet for discussion in the shortest possible time. The most important of these are five: (1) reorganize police affairs, (2) supervise the courts, (3) protect savings, (4) monitor certain occupations, and (5) punish those who interfere with public agencies in a criminal manner. The government also promised to answer questions about this case in the Chamber of Deputies on Thursday this week. Colonial Minister Dalimier explained to the ministers the true relationship between him and the fraud case, and used various documents to prove that his heart was completely open. The points made by Dalimier were fully confirmed by Labor Minister Reynaud. Premier Doumergue also said that he himself had announced that Dalimier was indeed innocent, and all the Cabinet members expressed their approval of the Premier's declaration. (8th Havas)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French government is in a difficult position due to the Bayonne fraud case. Last night, there was a demonstration against the government in front of the Palace of Justice, with participants holding flags demanding that the government be ousted. Today, a large number of police were heavily guarded near the Chamber of Deputies. In the afternoon, the royalists demonstrated outside the Chamber, shouting slogans such as "Break the Thieves" and "We Demand Justice and Honor". The government is currently drafting a bill to improve the police and other aspects of government. (9th Reuters)</p>
<h3>Government Reorganization</h3>
<p>To Deal with Congressional Impeachment</p>
<p>(Paris) After today's cabinet meeting, it was announced that Labor Minister Ramadier of the Radical Socialist Party has been appointed as Colonial Minister, and the vacant position of Labor Minister will be taken over by Frot. With the former Colonial Minister Dalimier having resigned, the government can now face the impeachment that will be held in the Chamber of Deputies with greater confidence. (9th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Paris) Colonial Minister Dalimier has already resigned. His resignation stated that during the cabinet meeting, the cabinet members had clearly acknowledged that his heart was clear and innocent. He felt that he had no other choice, and that he did not want the Doumergue cabinet to be accused because of what happened in 1932 during his tenure as Labor Minister. Although public opinion criticisms did not implicate Premier Doumergue, he still felt uneasy, so he resigned on his own. The resignation also expressed his gratitude for Doumergue's righteousness and integrity. He also said that Doumergue did not order him to resign. Doumergue replied to the resignation, expressing regret for Dalimier's resignation and reiterating the cabinet's solidarity. (9th Havas)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French government is very unstable and is on the verge of collapse. Although the prime offender in the Bernie case, Stavisky, has committed suicide and Colonial Minister Dalimier has resigned, some right-wing cabinet members and socialists are deeply dissatisfied with this case. A special court will be opened on Thursday to investigate Premier Doumergue. If Doumergue cannot clearly explain all the doubts by then, they will elect a new premier. (9th National News)</p>
<h3>Court Postponements</h3>
<p>Also Have Strong Suspicions</p>
<p>(Paris) Stavisky, the prime offender in the Bayonne City public bond fraud case, committed suicide with a pistol in a villa in Chamonix, and was sent to the hospital for surgery, eventually dying at 3:00 PM. There were many fraud cases involving Stavisky. In one case, a person filed a complaint, but it was repeatedly postponed and not prosecuted. The government has recently organized a committee to investigate this matter and discovered that the defendant's case had been delayed by the court ten times. The committee will send a letter to the judge hearing the case to investigate the truth. After this case was exposed, Stavisky changed his name and hid in Chamonix, where he was detected by the police. They immediately rushed to the villa where Stavisky was hiding to arrest him. When they arrived, they saw that the villa was empty and uninhabited, except for one room, which was tightly closed. The police officers ordered him to open the door, but there was no response. They tried to break into the house, but they were unable to do so. At this time, they suddenly heard a gunshot from inside the room. The police then broke through the window and saw Stavisky lying in a pool of blood. At this time, Stavisky was still trying to fire another shot, but he was unable to do so and soon lost consciousness. (9th Havas) Bayonne The arrest of Bayonne Mayor Garat, who is also a member of parliament, has shocked the entire city. It is said that when Garat was arrested, the governor was close to tears, because Garat was a close friend of his and the judges. One of the judges said, "This is one of the most tragic days of my life, but friendship cannot hinder our responsibilities." Last night, the situation in Bayonne was extremely turbulent. Some of the crowd shouted loudly in the streets, saying that Garat had been arrested and was being held in prison.

<h3>Northern Route Army</h3>
<p>Captures Yanping:</p>
<p>| Situation in Northern Fujian War Drastically Changes |</p>
<p>Nanchang Communication: The Northern Route Army, under Jiang Dingwen, after recovering Shaowu and Shunchang in northern Fujian at the end of last year, advanced towards Yanping with divisions such as [missing]. Yanping is the gateway to northwestern Fujian, located at the confluence of the Dongxi, Futunxi, and Shaxi rivers. It connects Jian'ou to the east, Shayong to the west, Gandong to the north, and overlooks Minqing. It controls the throat of the upper reaches of the Minjiang River. Cai Tingkai and others attached great importance to this and had fortifications built in advance as a barrier for Fuzhou. However, after the Northern Route Army arrived there in the new year, they made some deployments and then launched a general attack on Yanping city on the 5th. The Fujian army defended the Jiufeng Mountain outside the city and the northeastern highlands and mounted machine guns and artillery on the Weiyuan Tower, putting up stubborn resistance. The Central Army fought bravely, attacking from below, and advanced fiercely under the cover of the air force. By the evening, the [missing] division occupied Jiufeng Mountain and bombarded the enemy inside the city. On the 6th, the Fujian army was unable to hold out, and the highlands outside the city were completely taken by the Central Army. By the afternoon, the Central Army had completely recovered Yanping city. The Fujian army retreated along the Jianxi River, gathering at Shuikou to defend it. The Central Army pursued victoriously, approaching Bozhou. The [illegible] Campaign Headquarters announced that Shuikou and Gutian were surrounded by the Central Army. With the recovery of Yanping by the Central Army, the situation in the Northern Fujian war has drastically changed. The Campaign Headquarters also announced that Chen and Li had jointly rebelled, and many did not approve of their actions. There have been several instances of Fujian soldiers defecting. The most important ones: (1) On New Year's Eve last year, when the Central Army was pressing towards Yanping, Tan Qixiu, commander of the pseudo-Supplementary Division, first sent an envoy to pledge allegiance. Chiang immediately appointed Tan as commander of the 19th Route Army and will send personnel to inspect and reorganize it. (2) Although Lu Xingbang, commander of the newly organized Second Division, was enticed by the Fujian side with the post of commander of the 15th Army, Lu had to feign compliance because he was under surveillance. Chiang commended him greatly and appointed Lu as commander of the 52nd Division, stationed in Youxi, guarding the Jing position, preparing to attack the rebels in Yongtai and Minqing. (3) Situ Fei's brigade under Shen Guanghan's command came over with his troops from Gutian on the 3rd. Zhang Zhizhong submitted it to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek for approval to accept them and transfer them to Pingnan for reorganization. In addition, Chen Zhaixuan and others have defected and have been notified to take office. There are also many civilian armies rising up to attack the rebels. (January 6, I)</p>
<h3>Tianjin French Municipal Council Returns</h3>
<p>Naval Academy Site: Return of 24 Mu</p>
<p>Naval Academy Temporarily Suspended</p>
<p>Tianjin Communication: Last spring, before Zhang Xueliang went abroad, he signed an agreement with the French Municipal Council of the Tianjin French Concession regarding the site of the Naval Academy, ceding it to the French side, which aroused attention from all parties. Whether Zhang's intention in signing the contract with the French Municipal Council was indeed as rumored to seek payment, or whether the matter was leaked and the payment was stopped, remains a mystery to this day. Last winter, Liu Ruiheng, Director of the Department of Health, came north to Tianjin and, together with counselors from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of the Navy, negotiated with the French side. The French Municipal Council agreed to return the site. However, how the French Municipal Council returned it, whether it sought payment, is unknown to the outside world. Recently, Tianjin has spread rumors that the Ministry of the Navy has recovered the site and will no longer establish a school in Tianjin, but will allocate it to Nankai University to build a school and hospital. Today, the reporter specifically inquired with various relevant parties about this matter and learned that the aforementioned rumors are not true. Previously, when Liu Ruiheng came to Tianjin to negotiate with the French Municipal Council, the French side agreed to return it, but it was not finalized at the time. It has recently been decided and notified to our Navy Department. That is, the original site of the school was a total of 39.5 mu. Last year, the French side took over and split it in the middle to build a road, occupying about 9 mu. The road was opened in the middle of November last year. A building called the "Balit Chemical Laboratory" was built in the southwest corner, occupying about 6 mu. There are still 24 mu left. Because the road passes through it, it is divided into two unequal-sided triangular sections in the north and south, each about 12 mu. It was originally planned to build houses on these, which would be occupied by the Municipal Council. Now, due to negotiations with our Navy Department, they have agreed to return them. Regarding the 15 mu of land that has already been occupied, a corresponding price may be paid in the future. Regarding the 24 mu of land that is being returned, there are two old buildings on the northern section, which house the Naval Medical School and Hospital and must still be occupied by the Naval Academy. The Naval Academy has not recruited new students for two years since the students graduated, and the school affairs have been suspended due to the unresolved land issue. However, the principal, Zhang Tingxu, still handles hospital affairs at the school with three professors and ten accounting and clerical staff. The professors also serve as doctors, seeing 30 to 40 patients daily. There are about a dozen inpatients. According to the principal, the Navy Department has recovered three-fifths of the land and still plans to run a medical school. The Navy Department will jointly organize a construction committee with the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of the Interior (Department of Health of the Ministry of the Interior) to renovate the school buildings. However, the date of implementation and the design are still uncertain. Before the school buildings are renovated, new students cannot be recruited, and the school will have to be temporarily suspended. The hospital will continue to operate. (7th)</p>
<h3>Hubei Construction Department Urges the China Merchants Bureau to</h3>
<p>Launch Express Ships on the Beijing-Hankou Route</p>
<p>| Specifying Timetables and Fares |</p>
<p>Hankou Communication: The China Merchants Bureau has long had plans to launch special express ships on the Beijing-Hankou route. The Hubei Construction Department and various road bureaus have negotiated and unanimously supported cooperation to launch them as soon as possible. However, due to various reasons, this has not yet been realized. The Construction Department recently received a report from the Maritime Administration Bureau with more detailed suggestions on this matter. It has made preliminary plans for the timetable, improvement of facilities, and reduction of fares, and has again sent a letter to the China Merchants Bureau to adopt and implement them. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Revised Timetable</h3>
<p>The slow speed of river vessels is due to the heavy cargo load and the time-consuming loading and unloading at each wharf. The only way to improve this is to follow the example of the railways and launch special express ships that do not carry cargo and only carry passengers. Use vessels with shallow drafts and high speeds. Set a timetable, stopping only at Wuhu, Anqing, and Jiujiang, the three major ports (originally planned to stop at only Jiujiang). Limit the stop at each place to half an hour. In this way, the upstream journey from Nanjing to Hankou will take about 34 hours, and the downstream journey from Hankou to Nanjing will take about 24 hours. If one ship is run every day, only three ships will be needed for dispatch. The proposed timetable is as follows: Upstream, Nanjing departure at 11 PM (connecting with the Shanghai-Beiping through train arriving at 3:05 PM and the Beijing-Guan through train arriving at 9:35 PM), Jiujiang departure at 10 PM the next day (connecting with the Nanxun express train arriving at 2:30 PM), Hankou arrival at 9 AM on the third day (connecting with the Beiping-Hankou express train arriving at 1:04 PM and the Xiang-E express train arriving at 5:30 PM). Downstream, Hankou departure at 10 AM (connecting with the Xiang-E express train arriving at 7 AM and the Beiping-Hankou express train arriving at 9:05 AM), Jiujiang departure at 5 PM (connecting with the downstream Nanxun express train at 2:30 PM), Nanjing arrival at 10 AM the next day (connecting with the Beiping-Pukou through train arriving at 11 AM and the Beijing-Shanghai express train arriving at 12:45 PM or 5:25 PM). This timetable does not conflict with the current river vessel timetable. The current river vessels upstream depart from Beijing at about 9 AM, while the special express ships will depart at 11 PM. The current river vessels downstream depart from Hankou at about 9 PM, while the special express ships will depart at 10 AM. Therefore, they are mutually complementary.</p>
<h3>Improved Facilities</h3>
<p>These ships will be approximately 200 feet long, smaller than the current river vessels to ensure speed. The passenger capacity will be limited to 500. Following the example of trains, there will be first, second, and third class, each with berths and seats. This will allow short-distance passengers or those who want to save money to purchase seats only. The ship's facilities do not need to be luxurious but should be clean and comfortable with attentive service. First, second, and third class will be equipped with heating and electric fans. Each will have a restaurant for individual dining. First and second-class berths will be equipped with bedding. Seat or berth numbers will be assigned when purchasing tickets to avoid confusion. Luggage, except for carry-on items, will be placed in the luggage room. Tea servers will not solicit tips. Sedan chairs and vendors will not be allowed on board to maintain order.</p>
<h3>Reduced Fares</h3>
<p>Fares should not be too high. First class will be on the</p>
<p>upper deck, second class on the middle deck</p>
<p>, and third class on the lower deck, specifically the stern of the middle deck. Fares must be lower than the current fares to benefit the public. The following proposed table should ensure that the business is not unprofitable. From Nanjing to Hankou (upstream) and from Hankou to Nanjing (downstream): First class seat, upstream 24 yuan, downstream 20 yuan; berth, upstream 36 yuan, downstream 30 yuan. Second class seat, upstream 14 yuan, downstream 12 yuan; berth, upstream 24 yuan, downstream 20 yuan. Third class seat, upstream 8 yuan, downstream 7 yuan; berth, upstream 12 yuan, downstream 10 yuan. (January 8)</p>
<h3>The Utopia of</h3>
<p>Neixiang and Zhenping Counties in Henan</p>
<p>Drugs are Prohibited and Cigarettes are Not Allowed to Enter</p>
<p>Jails and Detention Centers are Empty</p>
<p>Nanchang Communication: Chairman Chiang, based on the report from Li Peiji, Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Henan, and others on the political facilities in Neixiang and Zhenping counties, presented an abridged version for inspection. After reviewing it, Chiang considered the educational and nurturing programs in these two counties to be outstanding and worthy of emulation by other provinces and counties. In addition to ordering all counties to earnestly imitate them, he also summarized the key points and ordered the provincial governments to emulate them, taking into account local conditions. The key points are as follows: (1) Overview of Self-Government: Both Neixiang and Zhenping counties have the organization of a joint office of district self-government, which serves as the general hub for county administration. Its content is divided into general affairs, finance, construction, investigation, and propaganda departments, which separately manage all county affairs. There is also a local self-government committee, which serves as the legislative body of the county. All important policies for local reform and budgets must be approved by the committee before they can be implemented. In addition, townships and districts all have conciliation associations to mediate people's lawsuits. The county conciliation association is similar to the highest court in the county, and together with the aforementioned office and committee, it forms a system of separation of powers of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The county government is virtually nominal. Although this type of organization has no legal basis, it is quite serious in its work. The local people are accustomed to it and seem to be beneficial to practice.</p>
<p>(2) Self-Defense Strength: Neixiang focuses on cultivating military strength. The people have all received military training. The standing teams that have been organized and have complete uniforms and weapons are said to number nine regiments. In fact, there are more than that. All able-bodied men in the county are organized into reserve militias, with the training period set from the 15th day of the tenth month of the lunar calendar to the 15th day of the first month of the following year. During the training period, each person receives 1.5 dou of grain and 4,000 cash per month. Officers receive an additional 20,000 to 40,000 cash in public funds. They complete training in three months and are discharged, and can be called up at any time. The treatment of the standing militia is the same as before. They receive one set of military clothing, both single and cotton-padded. The supplies and expenses are purely allocated by each district according to the acreage, which is very costly, and the people are quite unable to bear it. Zhenping's self-defense force is also strong, with 1,500 standing militiamen. The treatment of its officers and soldiers and the fundraising methods are the same as in Neixiang. However, its training of reserve militias is not as orderly as in Neixiang, but its spirit is very lively. Each township has a team organization, and the weapons are all spears and halberds, with occasional cannons. They fight very bravely. Although the burden on the people is lighter than in Neixiang, there are also complaints that they cannot bear it. (3) Construction Achievements: The construction achievements of Neixiang and Zhenping counties are unmatched by other counties. Environmental telephones have been installed, and the county's roads are very well-maintained. The Neixiang roadbed is solid, and the road surface is paved with a five-inch-thick layer of coarse sand, so traffic is not hindered by rain. Both counties pay great attention to agriculture and forestry. Barren mountains, riverbanks, and roadsides have all been planted with trees, and hundreds of stones of mulberry seeds have been planted in preparation for promoting silkworm farming. Near the mountains, wasteland has been reclaimed and canals have been dug for irrigation. For the improvement of agriculture, both the county and districts have rural committees responsible for researching and improving agriculture. Industries such as brewing companies, glass factories, silk weaving factories, and various handicrafts are also being actively planned and improved.</p>
<p>(4) Other Special Points: Both Neixiang and Zhenping counties, townships, districts, and the county have established frugality associations to promote frugality. All civil servants and the public wear local cloth, that is, silk products produced in the county, and are not seen wearing foreign clothes. They are completely sold to other counties. The arrival of foreign goods is strongly resisted. All daily necessities produced locally or that can be replaced by other types of goods are not allowed to purchase foreign goods. Those who violate this will have their goods confiscated and will be fined. Drugs have been banned, and cigarettes are not allowed to enter. Those who gamble or commit theft, in addition to being punished, will have their neighbors punished under joint liability, with a fine of 20,000 cash for the neighborhood chief, 50,000 cash for the township chief, and 100,000 cash for the district chief. There are very few people who commit crimes, and the jails and detention centers are empty. These phenomena are truly rare. (January 6)</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Lake Bandits Discovered in West Tai Lake</p>
<p>Since the 8th of this month, a large gang of lake bandits has been discovered near Pingtai Mountain in West Tai Lake, Suzhou Township. They are riding on six or seven boats, anchored there. There are about seventy or eighty bandits, equipped with both short and long guns, and there is no movement. The 6th joint defense area of Dongting East Mountain sent personnel to investigate and learned that this gang of bandits gathered from Jintan, Liyang, and other places, and went down Tai Lake from Yixing. Another group is also expected to gather there in the coming days. They will rob towns in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Yan Yansheng, Director of the Joint Defense Area, reported to the county government yesterday (9th), requesting that a team be sent immediately to suppress them to avoid breeding a scourge. The county government, upon receiving the report, consulted the Second Water Police District and ordered the police brigade to encircle and suppress them soon.</p>
<h3>County Government Establishes an Inquiry Office</h3>
<p>The Wu County Government, in accordance with the order of the Provincial Government relayed from the Executive Yuan, has established a people's inquiry office in each county to allow people to inquire about the laws and regulations promulgated by the government and other administrative matters in writing or in person. It also stipulates that the staff of the inquiry office must treat the inquiring public with sincerity and must not solicit rewards. Zou Jing, the county magistrate, believes that given the situation in Wu County, it is necessary to establish the inquiry office as soon as possible. Therefore, he has ordered the secretariat to draft regulations and actively prepare for its establishment as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Legal Entities Telegraph Request for Abolition of Surcharges</h3>
<p>The Wu County Chamber of Commerce, Farmers Association, and Education Association telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government yesterday, jointly requesting the abolition of surcharges for road construction and other expenses under the local surcharge items. The telegram stated that the local budget for Wu County for the 22nd year has been reviewed and reduced by the Finance Department. However, the road construction surcharge of 8.1% per yuan and the agricultural improvement acreage levy of 3.2% per yuan listed in the budget have not been removed. At a time when the rural areas are collapsing and the people's strength is exhausted, the above two items, which the Finance Department has stated are included in the provincial budget, are truly difficult for the provincial treasury to bear, and the farmers are even more unable to bear the burden. Moreover, they conflict with the Ministry's order that they must not exceed the regulations of the regular tax. Therefore, the telegram jointly beseeched the Provincial Governor to sympathize with the people's difficulties and approve the abolition of the previous two expenses to alleviate the people's hardship.</p>
<h3>County Party Department Staff Arrested and Escorted to the Capital</h3>
<p>Gu Baiyu and Xu Zishou, current staff members and members of the County Party Department, were arrested by Liu, a platoon leader of the Gendarmerie Command, and plainclothes soldiers at the Xinsu Hotel in the North Bureau the day before yesterday. They were escorted to the Capital Gendarmerie Command for interrogation at about 1 AM that night. The reason for their arrest is said to be suspicion of being reactionary. Their family members are now trying to rescue them.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Clearing Wasteland and Strictly Prohibiting Thugs from Obstructing Land Tax Increases</p>
<p>Because Suzhou Province's counties are handling the land survey and measurement, all official and civilian barren fields are being taxed according to the law. But after the land tax increases, local thugs often emerge to seize them, obstruct the profession, and extort and extort at will, so that good people cannot bear their disturbance, they are willing to leave good land barren, which causes losses to the country and the people. News was obtained from the province yesterday that Xu Zhefu, Pan Shiliu, Sun Yusheng, Zhang Shijun and others jointly submitted a report to the Ministry of Finance and the Department of Finance, requesting that all counties be ordered to strictly prohibit the above situations. The Provincial Finance Department issued an order to each county government to strictly prohibit the matter after receiving the report. The original instruction of the Provincial Finance Department, No. 286, is recorded as follows: It is understood that the points mentioned in the report are not without merit. It is hereby ordered to all counties and bureaus to follow and implement it.</p>
<h3>Discussing Sampling and Inspecting Business Tax Issues</h3>
<p>In order to rectify the business tax, Zhao Dihua, Director of the Finance Department of Jiangsu Province, specially dispatched Commissioner Zhou Shuzi to Wuxi the day before yesterday to sample and inspect the account books of various merchants, and ordered the county government to assist him at any time. After Commissioner Zhou arrived in Wuxi, he immediately contacted County Magistrate Yan, and at the same time convened a discussion meeting with more than 50 representatives of various industries, including Chen Zhanru, Jiang Zhongliang, Cai Jiansan, Li Zhongchen, and Cheng Jingtang, at the county government. Commissioner Zhou reported that because the provincial treasury was very short of funds, the business tax would be rectified, and that most of the business taxes in Wuxi had not been paid. In the future, personnel should be dispatched to sample and inspect the account books. If the arrears are too large, the county will be ordered to pursue the collection, in order to enrich the provincial treasury. Representatives of various industries said that because business was sluggish and they were unable to pay the taxes, they unanimously advocated that the provincial government should consider the difficulties of the merchants and handle the matter leniently. After a long discussion, they dispersed without any results.</p>
<h3>The Fire at Dashiqiao is Expanding</h3>
<p>The Xie Sheng Silk Store in Dashiqiao was suddenly burned down on the third day of the month at midnight, and it spread to the neighbors on the left and right, Xie Taixiang, Dongyang, Yongchun, Runji, and Yonglong butcher shop across the river, as well as the families of Shi Zhu, Mao Zhou, Qian Xijin, and Chen Chang, causing losses of more than 100,000 gold. Afterwards, the neighboring shops, Shitaishang, etc., alleged that Xie Sheng had previously insured a huge amount of fire insurance with insurance companies such as Shanghai Baolong, Siming, and Huacheng, and that the cause of the fire was suspected of being arson. A public letter was sent to the county chamber of commerce to request the county government to investigate and deal with it. The insurance companies that underwrote Xie Sheng's fire insurance sent senior staff members the day before yesterday, together with surveyors sent by the Louis-More public notary office, to inspect the truth at the fire site together with Fan Jinwen, the person in charge of Xie Sheng, and to take photos. At that time, the shop assistants of the victimized shops questioned Fan Jinwen, resulting in a conflict, and Fan's silk satin fox fur coat was torn. Afterwards, Yongchun staff members Qian Zhongwei, Liu Shunlin, Wu Zikang, Wang Hengxiang and others handed Fan over to a professional police officer to be escorted to the Public Security First Branch Bureau, which was transferred to the General Bureau. Director Li learned about the above situation after questioning and transferred it to the County Court Prosecutor's Office for investigation, as the case was complicated.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Opening of the Jingjian Road is Expected Soon</p>
<p>The Jingjian Highway starts from Nanjing and ends at Jianping, Anhui, with a total length of 104 kilometers.

<h3>Liu Zizhi Abandons Appeal</h3>
<p>Liu Zizhi, the "Red Pill King" of Nantong, was apprehended by the former Narcotics Suppression Office and transferred to the provincial government. He was then handed over to the Provincial Department of Civil Affairs and detained by the Provincial Public Security Bureau. After the reorganization of the provincial government and the appointment of Chairman Chen to govern Jiangsu, this case was reviewed. In October of last year, he was sentenced and sent to the Zhenjiang Court for legal proceedings. Following an investigation by the court's Prosecutor's Office, he was prosecuted in the criminal court in accordance with the anti-opium law. The criminal court president, Mr. Ouyang Liang, personally interrogated him. After the arguments concluded, he was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment. After the sentence was pronounced, Liu declared in court that he was not satisfied and requested permission to appeal, which was approved. Later, realizing that he could not escape the law, Liu submitted a written statement voluntarily abandoning his right to appeal, requesting immediate imprisonment. It is reported that this has been approved, and he will be sent to prison shortly.</p>

<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Civil Affairs Department Dispatches Investigator to Changshu</p>
<p>A robbery occurred in Donglai Town in this county, and the river police were robbed of their firearms, resulting in significant losses. However, it is said that ten days before the incident, a coffin carrying firearms came across the river from Nantong, Jiangbei. Someone had telegraphed the county police team requesting a search, but Captain Wang did not carry it out, so the robbers were fully prepared when the incident occurred, and the losses were quite large. Consequently, the blame is being placed on Police Captain Wang Kunshan for failing to take precautions beforehand, and complaints have been filed with the provincial government. The Department of Civil Affairs has dispatched Deng Feihuang, along with Han Ya-yi, a member of the Third District Inspectorate, to Changshu for a secret investigation. Their movements are quite discreet, and they are residing in the county library, so the outside world knows very little. Deng and others stayed in Changshu for four days and personally investigated Donglai Town. They have completed their work and left Changshu on the morning of the 8th.</p>

<h3>Local Achievements</h3>
<p>Central Army's Victory Report in Fujian Campaign</p>
<h3>National Army Closes in on Fuzhou</h3>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports: According to a Fujian agency in this city, a telegram received from Xiamen yesterday morning stated that the Central Army had captured Shuikou on the day before yesterday, and the Fujian army was collapsing toward Fuzhou. The Central Army's vanguard is now only sixty miles from Fuzhou, and the provincial capital is in a state of panic. The two sides are still engaged in bloody battles.</p>
<h3>Tan Qixiu Defects</h3>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports: (Another telegram) Tan Qixiu has indeed defected, supporting the central government. However, Tan's whereabouts after his defection are unknown.</p>
<h3>Puppet Government Moves to Zhangzhou</h3>
<p>A reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency learned from military circles yesterday that the Fujian army is now digging trenches around the provincial capital and actively deploying defensive works because Gutian has been captured by the Central Army and Fuzhou is under pressure. At the same time, the puppet organization is being moved to Zhangzhou.</p>
<h3>Pingyang and Anjing are Normal as Usual</h3>
<p>No War on the Fujian-Zhejiang Border</p>
<p>There are widespread rumors in Shanghai that the fighting in Pingyang is fierce. The Xinhui Pingyang wheel of the Shanghai Xing Company arrived in Shanghai last night from Pingyang. The reporter of our office went to the wheel to investigate the actual news. What the crew said is as follows.</p>
<h3>Pingyang is definitely fine</h3>
<p>The Xinhui Pingyang wheel arrived in Shanghai at half past five yesterday afternoon. According to the crew, the ship left Pingyang on the 6th and Ruan on the 7th. When in Pingyang, they spent two days at anchor. The market is the same as usual, and there are no military operations. Fuding, which belongs to Fujian, and its sea port is Shacheng. The Xinhui Pingyang also stopped at there, but it has now stopped open. There are also no troops in the two places, only a small team of the Central Army to the Tongshan place outside the Fuding Nei Feng Shui Ridge a few days ago, stationed there, but there is no action.</p>
<h3>Goods Are Crowded and Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The most felt by the Pingyang and Ruan areas after the Fujian Rebellion was the tension in finance and the inability of goods to be transported to Fujian, so the pork and other surpluses on the market were very cheap. One yuan of foreign currency can buy eight pounds of fresh meat. Now, the livestock has been re-equipped to Shanghai for sale, and other goods are also very crowded. The Xinhui Pingyang arrival in Shanghai this time, the goods are full, more than usual, the ship passed through Ruan, there is also nothing, so people's hearts are very stable.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Fujian Border</h3>
<p>Also, a wheel company in this city received a letter from the Fujian branch yesterday, which contained "Fujian Province has been independent for two months, and the war has not seen launch. The contents of the Shanghai newspaper are not the facts." Watching in this letter, it is enough to prove that places such as Pingyang Taishun have not yet reached the time of contact.</p>
<h3>Seawheel Fenshi Wenzhou</h3>
<p>Wenzhou is also the nearest port to Fujian by sea. In recent days, there have been six or seven new Ming · Guangli · Taishun and so on open to Wenzhou by the seawheel.</p>

<p>Zhang Xueliang, Chairman of the Military Commission Branch of Beiping, arrived by Italian Post Kang de Fan di on the afternoon before yesterday.</p>
<h3>Southwest Test Flight</h3>
<p>Because of the Mislanding in Annam, He Was Detained</p>
<p>China Aviation Company Telegraphed for Negotiations for Return China Central News Agency Yun, China Aviation Company, for the sake of developing the Southwest border, opened the Southwest Air Line, which was on December 30 last year. On the same day, the chief mechanic An Lisheng drove the No. 11 Stinson land machine and took off from Hankou for the first test flight. On the 31st, after the machine passed Longzhou, the weather suddenly changed drastically and heavy fog covered the sky, so he mistakenly walked on the route. He was forced to land near Liangshan Kobang in French Annam, and was detained by the local authorities. The company received a telegraph report from the mechanic An and others in Hanoi in the morning, and immediately reported to the Ministry of Communications for instructions. The following is a record of his detention process.</p>
<h3>Take off from Hankou</h3>
<p>The Southwest Air Line starts from Hankou, passes through Changsha · Guangzhou · Longzhou · Kunming · and arrives at Chongqing · as the end point. The line took off from Hankou at 9:15 in the morning on December 30 last year. The flight was piloted by Chief Mechanic An Lisheng, accompanied by Nie Kaiyi, Director of the Mechanic Team, and Huang Baoxian, Director of the Business Team. At 2:30 in the afternoon, he passed through Changsha and arrived in Guangzhou. The next morning (31st) at 9 o'clock, the original machine took off, and director Huang Baoxian stayed in Guangzhou and did not leave. It was originally scheduled to pass through Longzhou and arrive in Kunming overnight on the same day, and then fly from Kunming to Chongqing on January 1.</p>
<h3>Mistaken Landing Was Detained</h3>
<p>The machine was still driven by Mechanic An at 9 a.m. on the 31st, and took off from Guangzhou, rested slightly through Longzhou, and then continued to fly. However, shortly after flying, the weather suddenly changed drastically, and heavy fog covered the sky, resulting in a lost route and mistakenly entering the French Annam airspace. Affected by the flood changes, they were forced to land near Liangshan (Laobang) Kobadg in Annam and were detained by the local authorities. The mechanics An Lisheng and Nie Kaiyi were also interrogated, and only then did they realize that the route was lost due to heavy fog and forced to land. The two were treated with courtesy, but the machine was still detained.</p>
<h3>Telephone Negotiation</h3>
<p>After the machines were detained, An and Nie went to Hanoi to visit the Governor there, explained the reasons for the lost route and forced landing, and asked for the return of the detained aircraft. The Governor believed that the forced landing of the lost route was a common thing in the flying world and was not strange, but he could not immediately promise to return the detained aircraft, and had to wait for a telegram from the Chinese government's Ministry of Communications before it could be returned. Therefore, An Nie and others are still staying in Hanoi, waiting for the Ministry of Communications to telegraph to prove that after the return, they will drive the original machine through Longzhou Kunming and arrive in Chongqing to complete the route</p>
<h3>It Can Be Solved</h3>
<p>After the reporter of the Central News Agency got the news, he visited the general manager of the company, Dai Enji, and asked about the detention. According to the answer, the company did not get the telegraph report from An Nie and others in Hanoi until this morning (yesterday morning). After receiving the telegram, I reported to Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Communications and asked Minister Zhu to telegraph proof so that the machine could be returned as soon as possible and the Southwest test flight could be completed as soon as possible. It is expected that the case can be resolved within two or three days.</p>
<p>Returning from Europe to Shanghai, he received Chen Gongbo, the representative of President Wang and the head of the department, and Yan Xishan, the representative of Yan Xishan, the director of the Jinxi Suijing, at his residence this morning.</p>

All visits were of the nature, so the talks were no more than ten minutes, and there were no important contacts. Zhang also drove to visit Song Ziwen · Wu Tiecheng · Du Yuesheng · Li Shizeng · and others yesterday afternoon to show his gratitude.</p>
<h3>Stay in Shanghai Briefly to Report to Jiang</h3>

According to the talks, (1) Zhang still needs to stay in Shanghai briefly. The date of going to North China and Jiangxi to meet with Jiang is still uncertain. After Zhang arrived in Shanghai yesterday (that is, the day before yesterday), he had already telegraphed Chairman Jiang to report everything. Jiang has not yet sent a reply telegram to Shanghai. (2) All of you who have come to Shanghai from all parts of China to welcome Zhang are still in Shanghai and have not returned to the north. (3) Zhang expressed indifference to the question of his whereabouts after his return to China, but it depends on how the central government decides.

<h3>Mayor Wu Hosted a Banquet Yesterday</h3>
<p>Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng hosted a banquet for Zhang at the Shanghai Municipal Government Reception Office on Xiafei Road at about 7 p.m. yesterday to clean the dust for him.

<h3>Aviation Exhibition</h3>
<p>Decision to Extend Exhibition</p>
<p>Due to the impact of the Fujian Rebellion</p>
<p>China Aviation Association, for the extension of the Aviation Exhibition, yesterday released a special message saying that the Aviation Exhibition to be held by the Association was launched in mid-October last year, and it has been selected on the 28th of this month. Held at the Chinese Art Society on Elmer Road, it is hoped that the holding of the Aviation Exhibition on this tragic and heroic anniversary of January 28 will trigger the determination and interest of the Chinese people in building air defense with the participation of the Japanese Air Force. At the beginning of the preparation, we sent telegrams to the aviation armory and aviation schools, etc., asking them to send aircraft parts, air warfare ordnance, and various mold thorns and charts to the meeting for display, which has been approved and started to prepare exhibits. Later, due to the sudden rise of the Fujian Rebellion, the Air Force was ordered to assist and had no time to do so, so the Association also decided to extend the exhibition. However, several newspapers still published news that the exhibition was opening on time, and Chinese and foreign people were concerned about the aviation industry and inquired about the Association.</p>
<h3>Rumor That All</h3>
<p>Tenants Oppose Rent Increase</p>
<p>How Can You Increase Rent When the Market Is Downturning?</p>
<p>The Tenants Were in an Uproar and Rose Up in Opposition</p>
<p>Chuanfuxing Real Estate on Xinzha Road is owned by Wan Zu Land Company, with a total of three branches and dozens of households. The landlord has always been able to pay the rent on a monthly basis without any arrears. Unexpectedly, the company suddenly notified the tenants of each branch that from February, they would have to increase 30% of the rent they are currently charging. The tenants were shocked and lost their color upon receiving this notice, and all believed that the rent there was already very high. Now that all industries are depressed and the market is sluggish, and the tenants are all businessmen, in this economic panic, the tenants everywhere are demanding rent reductions, and the company suddenly increases the rent by 30%, which is really ignoring the difficulties of the tenants and is absolutely unacceptable. Yesterday, all the tenants jointly wrote a letter to Wanhe Company, requesting that it should promptly understand the difficulties of the business and cancel the proposed 30% rent increase, and requested a definite reply after receiving the letter.</p>
<h3>The Acting Consul General</h3>
<p>Of France in Shanghai, Mei Li'ai, is Officially Appointed Awas Agency, Paris, 8th Electrics Yun, French Consul General in Shanghai Mei Li'ai, originally a first-class consul, acting Consul General, was recently promoted to Consul General.</p>
<h3>Huang Shaoxiong Came to Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Planning to Meet with Zhang Xueliang to Negotiate</p>
<p>Minister of the Interior Huang Shaoxiong came to Shanghai from Beijing by night train at 7:30 yesterday morning, planning to meet with Zhang Xueliang, who had just returned from Europe, to discuss everything, and will return to Beijing within two or three days.</p>
<h3>Major Cotton Mills</h3>
<p>Jointly Organize Sales Company</p>
<p>Clearing Existing Yarn to Stabilize Yarn Prices</p>
<p>Contact Each Other to Facilitate Flow</p>
<p>Last year, due to the impact of the North China War and the Japanese yarn invasion of the Tianjin market, the yarn sales of Chinese merchants' cotton mills were sluggish and the existing yarn was piled up, with a total of more than 100,000 bales. Therefore, in order to do their best to maintain, the factories once reduced their work and tightened up, but the move to reduce work only helped for a while, and the existing yarn was not cleared, which was not a fundamental plan. Therefore, since the establishment of the Cotton Industry Control Association, the Association first advocated finding ways to clear the existing yarn to stabilize yarn prices, and at the same time planned to find ways to organize sales agencies. Yesterday, it was claimed by the yarn industry that the cotton control association, as a government agency, was not convenient to handle the organization directly, so it was later changed to a sales company automatically organized by major cotton mills. Since the preparations have been carried out, it can be formally established. There are more than ten major manufacturers participating, including Yong'an · Shen Xin · Pu Yi · Tong Yi · Dafeng · Minsheng · Long Mao · and so on. For this organization, major cotton mills only tentatively determine one or two to take care of and preside over. All existing yarn, after distribution, is transported and sold to other ports by the factories separately, and it is said that the purpose of this organization is to regulate market prices and facilitate yarn sales. After its establishment, it will exist forever in order to contact each other at any time to meet the necessary. The Cotton Industry Control Association will still provide strong assistance to the organization.</p>
<h3>British Industrial Exhibition</h3>
<p>Letter Invites Chinese Merchants to Participate</p>
<p>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Real Estate, stating that the British Commercial Counselor's letter opened that the National Industrial Exhibition was scheduled to be held in London and Pumingham from February 19 to March 2, 1934, respectively. If the leaders of the industry and commerce in your country go to participate, our office sincerely welcomes them, etc., and the corresponding letter requests your association to inform the leaders of each industry and send a list of the names of the participants to the review so that it can be forwarded.</p>
<p>After receiving the letter, the association has sent letters to the leaders of each industry yesterday.</p>
<h3>Fengpu Wheel Picks up Wounded Soldiers Difference Wheel</h3>
<p>Wanxiang Collision Wheel Case Has Been Adjudicated</p>
<p>The Changjiang Wheel Fengpu of the Sanbei Company returned to Shanghai from Hankou this time. When the ship arrived in Nanjing, unloaded the goods and passengers, and then sailed to Shanghai, when the ship left Nanjing, when the ship reversed, because the speed was too fast, it slammed into the small wheel of the soldier's difference named Haihua, which was parked at the Taichang Machine Wharf. When the shipowner discovered it, the building products on the deck of the Haihua Wheel, such as cabins and doors, etc., had been destroyed. The Difference Wheel Management Office approached Fengpu for negotiations, and the Nanjing Sanbei Branch agreed to repair all the damaged places immediately, and the Ning Bureau would bear the losses. The Fengpu Wheel continued to sail to Shanghai. Fortunately, there was no one in the Haihua Difference Wheel, so it only slightly hit the ship.</p>
<p>The Wanxiang wheel, which crashed into the Lian'an wheel in Qijiang, has now been adjudicated by the Hankou Maritime Affairs Bureau. Lian'an Lingjiang Pan Yixiang has been called, and the two Wanxiang on-duty Lingjiang are also staying in Hankou to prepare for the confrontation. More than 60 bodies of those who drowned have been recovered, and the bodies that have not been recovered have generally flowed in all directions and cannot be salvaged. Wang Youzhi, the shipowner of Jiangjian, whom Sanbei hired as an arbitrator, has gone to Hankou and conducted an on-the-spot investigation. The court will be held for questioning soon.</p>
<h3>Yangtze River</h3>
<p>Hua Wheel is Affected by the Disturbance of the Japanese Wheel</p>
<p>Guo Wheel Merchants Groan Endlessly</p>
<p>Requesting the Wheel Bureau to Reduce the Short Ratio</p>
<p>Recruiting Merchants from All Ships Bears the Brunt</p>
<p>Chinese merchants' river boats have recently been affected by the disturbance of Japanese boats, which has made the business directors of each boat unable to maintain their losses. Yesterday, the merchants of each river boat of the China Merchants Bureau unanimously requested the General Bureau to find ways to maintain and reduce the ratio, otherwise it would be difficult to operate. The China Merchants Bureau has decided to submit a plan for the bureau affairs meeting today.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Wheel Abuses and Falls Prices</h3>
<p>Although there are only four Japanese ships sailing on the Yangtze River, the merchants of each Japanese ship have no quotas for each up and down passenger foot, and the passengers take the wheel, abuse the ticket price, and secretly agree with the ticket office and yellow fish heads in each port. For the Shanghai Hankou inter-warehouse ticket, according to the established practice, Chinese merchants' wheels must collect at least five yuan and two corners per person, and the Japanese ship reduces the collection of three yuan, of which one yuan is given to the recruiter as remuneration, and the fire food is also free of charge. Since its implementation, passengers traveling to and from the Yangtze River's inter-warehouse have flocked to Japanese ships. The general ticket office, which used to pull passengers for Chinese merchants' river boats, is now abandoning this and going to that. As for the four Japanese ships, traveling to and from Shanghai and Hankou, each time is full of passengers. The inter-warehouse passengers of Chinese river boats have been severely hit, and the passenger foot income of each business director has fallen by a thousand feet.</p>
<h3>Small Water Feet Also Return to the Public</h3>
<p>The business director of the Changjiang ship usually relies on the small water foot income of the cargo on the warehouse surface of the opening class and the profit of the inter-warehouse ticket due to the limited salary and wages, which is less than one-third of the wages of the cargo department. Last year, since the China Merchants Bureau rectified the slightly covered and the cargo foot trickled into the public, the income of the business directors has been greatly reduced. According to the statistics of the bureau, only the Jiang wheel part, after the rectification, the small water foot alone can increase the income by more than 50,000 yuan per year. The merchants have repeatedly requested the bureau to slightly increase the salary, but it is not enough. According to the words of each business director yesterday, recently since the Japanese ship disturbed, each line of first-class ship, due to the ratio and other items, must pay 5,000 gold, so it must lose more than 1,000 yuan, that is, the second-class ship with a ratio of more than 3,000 yuan, it must also lose six or seven hundred yuan at a time. He also said that the losses of the river boat merchants on the Yangtze River are the largest at present.</p>
<h3>Increase the Military Subsidy for Each Ship</h3>
<p>Between the Yangtze River ship from Hankou Jiujiang Nanjing, the soldiers come and go, almost no ship without, at every turn dozens of hundreds of people, not only without tickets, but also must share food, occupy the cabin, especially the remaining things, the business directors of each river ship have repeatedly requested the wheel bureau to subsidize, so as to avoid losses, the China Merchants Bureau has been approved by Liu Hongsheng to reduce the payment by half of the ratio of each ship, and each director feels that it is far from the facts, and yesterday went to the bureau again, asking to increase the military subsidy, together with the losses of each item, please deduct 30% of the set ratio, and temporarily pay 70%, otherwise it will be difficult to support.</p>
<h3>Present to the Prime Minister for Verification</h3>
<p>This time, due to the loss of each class,</p>
<p>The directors of the shipping bureau's rivers and wheels</p>
<p>There are many cases of thousands of yuan, and few cases of hundreds.</p>
<p>There is also a brewing of salary increases for the staff of the cargo department used by each ship. Yesterday, they came to the bureau together to ask for a reduction in passenger feet, because Liu Hongsheng went to Qingdao, and he had to return to the bureau by Jiang'an wheel today, so the business section signed the opinions on the six methods requested by the directors, and prepared to transfer them to President Liu for verification today.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Bureau Leases Wheels to Transport Cotton Wheat</h3>
<p>He Molin Returned to Shanghai from the US Yesterday</p>
<p>Low Lease Price Very Satisfactory Ready to Load At Any Time</p>
<p>Three Batches of American Wheat Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Four Batches on the Way</p>
<p>The third batch of cotton and wheat purchased by our government from the United States arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, and the fourth batch will be imported on the 13th. He Molin, who went to the United States to contact the China Merchants Bureau to rent wheels for loading cotton and wheat, has already returned to China</p>
<h3>Finished Publicly The State-Run China Merchants Bureau Leased Wheels to Load</h3>
<p>In order to load American loan cotton and wheat to transport to China, he specially sent He Molin, the chief of the business section, to the United States on November 20 last year to contact. Now it has been completely completed. The American loan wheat is loaded from the United States in a continuous manner and transported to Shanghai. He took the American President steamer Kerry Flun from Seattle, USA on the 27th of last month, and entered the Wusongkou at 5:15 yesterday morning and docked at Bailianjing, Pudong. Mr. He landed from the Xinguang Pier at 8:20 in the morning. Colleagues from the China Merchants Bureau went to the pier to welcome him. After landing, he returned to his residence to rest. In the afternoon, he went to the bureau to work as usual.</p>
<h3>Negotiations Were Satisfactory The Reporter of Xin Sheng She Met with He</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Molin, he was ordered to go to the United States to negotiate the lease of wheels to transport American loan cotton and wheat to China. The total number of leased wheels was more than 50 ships, and the tonnage was more than 5,000 tons. The lease price was low, only about 2 US dollars per ton, which is about 6 yuan in Chinese currency. If the government needs to load American loan cotton and wheat into China, it can be loaded and transported from Shanghai to the United States, and it is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai in 25 days or 27 days, and it is divided into one-way and two-way. The lease price is the same as the freight of Shanghai to Guangdong, but the distance is relatively large, so it is very satisfactory.</p>
<h3>Three Batches Arrived in Shanghai The Third Batch of 7,500 American Wheat</h3>
<p>42 tons, loaded by the Fenter wheel from the United States, entered Wusongkou at 8:20 a.m. yesterday and docked at the 36th to 37th pontoons of the Huangpu River in Yangshupu. The China Merchants Bureau specially sent a small worker to the pontoon to arrange it. In the afternoon, it began to unload the cargo, which was directly extracted by the Chinese flour mills that purchased it.</p>
<h3>The Fourth Batch Arriving Soon: The Fourth Batch of American Wheat, Last Month</h3>
<p>The fourth batch of American wheat, amounting to over 15,000 tons, was initially loaded onto two ships in Portland, USA, bound for China. The state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has received a telegram confirming its expected arrival in Shanghai on the 13th of this month. The company has designated the "Leading River" vessel to proceed to the Wusongkou to receive the shipment. Furthermore, the Central Bank's American Loan Cotton and Wheat Office has submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance for approval, granting a blanket tax exemption on the import of American Loan wheat.</p>

<h3>Flour Mills</h3>
<p>Request for Tax Exemption on Purchased Foreign Wheat</p>
<p>Compromise Solution: Continued Negotiation on Proportions</p>
<p>Rumors of Complete Resolution Are Untrue</p>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, flour mills in Shanghai and inland areas requested exemption from import duties on purchased foreign wheat. After repeated petitions to Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi and the Shanghai Customs Office, the Ministry of Finance decided to collect import duties on foreign wheat according to the announced tariff regulations. However, it would devise a separate compensation plan for the losses incurred by the mills. A general agreement has been reached and negotiations are underway regarding the purchase and sale proportions and the price of American wheat flour. Rumors of a complete resolution are untrue. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Foreign Wheat Tax Payment Since December 16th of Last Year, the Ministry of Finance instructed all domestic customs houses</h3>
<p>(excluding Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian provinces) to implement advance collection of import duties on foreign rice and wheat, as well as additional duties on flour. Flour mills in Shanghai and inland areas, stating that before the official announcement of these tariff regulations, in addition to the nine shiploads of American wheat already purchased from the Central American Cotton and Wheat Affairs Office, they still lacked sufficient raw materials for flour production. Furthermore, the American wheat was all white, lacking sufficient gluten. They also directly ordered fourteen shiploads of red wheat from Canada and other places. If import duties were collected, the losses would amount to approximately 1.2 million yuan. The various mills, facing business decline, were unable to bear such a huge burden. Therefore, they convened a joint conference of representatives from all mills inside and outside the port, organizing a petition group to request exemption from taxes on purchased foreign wheat. However, the Ministry of Finance, citing tariff revenue and national administration, refused to reduce or exempt the taxes. The mills, for their own interests, continued to fight for it, repeatedly petitioning Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi and the Shanghai Customs Office. The Xiangmao Shun, Xinfu, Liyi, Lishenji, and Wu Yang Trading Companies, which were managing the American wheat, also protested to the customs authorities due to the mills stopping unloading. The Ministry of Finance authorities, after repeated discussions by the tax authorities, decided that import duties on foreign wheat should still be collected according to the announced regulations. Regarding the losses of the mills, 5% would be deducted from each yuan of the transaction of American flour as compensation. The mills, satisfied with the solution proposed by the Ministry of Finance, paid the required taxes on the imported foreign wheat according to the amount.</p>
<h3>Price Negotiations Regarding the Central American Cotton and Wheat Loan, 40 million was allocated for American cotton</h3>
<p>and 10 million for American wheat. However, the amount purchased for American wheat was only 3.6 million, with another 6.4 million allocated for a fixed imported commodity (i.e., American flour). The Ministry of Finance planned to sell all of this imported commodity to the mills. However, the mills were experiencing business downturns and financial difficulties, with stocks of domestic flour piling up and difficult to clear. If such a large quantity of American flour were imported, the domestic flour market would inevitably undergo changes. They requested a reduction to 4.6 million bags of flour and an increase in American wheat to 5.22 million (300,000 tons), to be imported in stages. Currently, both parties are continuing negotiations, and the Ministry of Finance has cabled the United States to inquire about flour prices. Therefore, the claim that it has been completely resolved is not factual.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Requests Clarification</h3>
<p>Measures Requiring Invoices for All Sales</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce recently received a letter from the Beiping Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating that the Hebei Province Stamp Tax Bureau for Tobacco and Alcohol and the Beiping Branch had repeatedly sent letters to various stores, stipulating that invoices with stamps must be issued for sales of one yuan or more, requesting a referral to the Ministry of Finance for clarification as to whether it is mandatory to issue invoices even if customers voluntarily do not need them. A telegram was issued, which reads: "To the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, we have just received a letter from the Beiping Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which states, 'Upon investigation, the Hebei Province Stamp Tax Bureau for Tobacco and Alcohol and the Beiping Branch have repeatedly requested notification to various stores that invoices must be issued for sales of one yuan or more and stamps must be affixed. This chamber believes that stamps are intended for use on documents that serve as proof of rights and interests. If the parties voluntarily waive their right to proof, it cannot be forced to issue invoices, nor can it be forced to affix stamps. Now, in order to expand sales, the Bureau is violating legal principles and forcing businesses to issue invoices for all sales, which is inappropriate. What if a buyer urgently needs to board a ship or cannot wait long, or does not need such proof (for personal use)? Must they wait for an invoice to be issued? This behavior is truly detrimental. This chamber held an executive committee meeting on December 30, 1933, with the participation of chairmen and representatives from various trade associations, resolving to send a letter to your esteemed association, requesting a joint submission to the Ministry of Finance for clarification, in order to comply accordingly.' In accordance with this, we hereby telegraphically submit to your department for review, earnestly requesting clarification so that we can inform accordingly. With sincere prayers, Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, respectfully greets you."</p>
<h3>International Labor Conference</h3>
<p>Difficulties in Producing Employer Representatives</p>
<p>The International Labor Conference is scheduled to be held in Geneva in May of this year. The Chinese government has designated Li Pingheng to attend as its representative and has submitted important proposals to the conference. Representatives from both labor and management are still being selected. However, according to industrial manufacturers, on previous occasions, Chinese representatives attended the International Labor Conference, travelling long distances to participate, but the results for the proposals submitted by China were merely discussed but not implemented, providing no practical benefit. They believe that the conference does not have the power or authority, so whether to attend or not is insignificant. Moreover, each attendance costs 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. In the current state of decline, manufacturers find it difficult to bear the burden again. At the same time, because the attending representatives are merely nominal, they are unwilling to attend. Even if suitable talent can be found this time, the government must provide assistance.</p>
<h3>Workers from Two Railway Factories</h3>
<p>Expose Mo Heng's Private Gain and Corruption</p>
<p>Ministry of Railways Dispatches Personnel, Finds No Evidence</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, workers from the Wusong Machine Factory and the Wusong Materials Factory of the two railways were dissatisfied with Mo Heng, the chief of the general affairs and materials departments, leading to a strike. The branch offices of the two factory unions issued a public declaration, attacking Mo for three points: private gain and corruption, undermining the labor movement, and insulting the party branch. At that time, the railway bureau considered the worker's strike to be delaying work and violating the service regulations of the railway. It immediately went with the party branch committee and union directors to persuade them to resume work first and wait for a thorough investigation. The workers insisted on removing Mo, but after three rounds of persuasion, they accepted the proposal to resume work first. At the same time, after receiving the report from the railway bureau, the Ministry of Railways dispatched counselors Zhang Weici and Wang Wenji to the bureau to investigate the truth. They have now obtained considerable results. The two counselors summoned representatives from all parties to a meeting in the conference room of the two railway bureaus yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM to report. Those invited to the meeting from the party branch were Chen Chengshi, Li Dasan, and Zou Zhengjian, three standing committee members. From the union were Min Luobi and Chen Bohua, two directors, and Cao Wenkui, the director of the Wusong branch office, among others. From the railway bureau was Yuan Boyang, the deputy director of the general affairs department. Zhang and Wang reported that the workers of the two factories had made three accusations against Mo: First, private gain and corruption. No facts were found. Mo also served as the head of the materials department, and the materials he purchased were of lower value than his predecessor. Therefore, the accusation of corruption was unsupported by evidence. Regarding the undermining of the labor movement, there was also no factual basis. As for the so-called insult to the party branch, the Central Party Headquarters must be requested to dispatch personnel for a thorough investigation. After the report, those present expressed their opinions. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM. According to reporters, Zhang and Wang are scheduled to return to Beijing today. If the workers are dissatisfied with the results of this investigation, they will submit another report to the Ministry for review.</p>
<h3>Seamen's Union Advises Zhengda Ship</h3>
<p>Not to Obstruct Workers' Registration</p>
<p>After Zhu Zuoting, the comprador of the Datong Shipping Company's Zhengda ship, refused to allow workers to join the Seamen's Union, forced them to sign a letter of intent not to join the union, and confiscated their union badges and certificates, over 150 middle-class workers from the company's Zida, Hongda, and Zhengda ships expressed dissatisfaction with the comprador's actions. They sent representatives to the Seamen's Special Party Branch, the Seamen's General Union, and the Seamen's Branch Union to request an end to the practice. Yesterday, the Seamen's Union, based on the resolution of the previous executive supervisory committee, sent a letter to Datong Company, instructing Zhu Zuoting, the comprador of the Zhengda ship, not to obstruct registration. At the same time, the guidance section was ordered to send personnel to cooperate with the Shanghai branch to persuade them further. Regarding the workers who were dismissed by the company, such as Jiao Liangcai and others, it was decided to resolve this matter after special consideration and negotiate with the company based on legal points.</p>

<h3>Handling of Ship Collisions</h3>
<p>Mei Maru and Lijiang Collision Case</p>
<p>Japanese Merchant Still Ignores; Will Submit to Ministry for Instructions</p>
<p>During the sixth session of the Ship Collision Committee of the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, the case of the collision between the Shanghai Transportation Company's Mei Maru ship and the Yangtze River Waterway Management Committee's Lijiang ferry was discussed. Because the owner of the Mei Maru ship, a Japanese merchant, did not respond and did not send anyone to the meeting, the case could not be judged. The committee notified both parties to submit a list of losses to the meeting. However, the Japanese merchant still ignored the responsibility he should bear. Therefore, the committee will discuss it again at the next meeting. If its decision is not obeyed and implemented, it will submit it to the Ministry for instructions. In addition, the cases of the Sanbei Shipping Company's Hongyuan ship sinking a fishing boat near Wuhu and the same company's Hengshan ship sinking a sailboat near Zhenjiang will also be discussed at the next meeting after the two ships arrive in port.</p>
<h3>After Wusong Ship Overturned Guangdong Case</h3>
<p>Company Has Accepted New Conditions</p>
<p>Guangdong Seamen Also Support Negotiations with Shanghai</p>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, regarding the dispute on Taikoo Company's Wusong ship, after the workers overturned the resolution conditions, the Seamen's Union repeatedly negotiated with the company. The company has largely accepted the five conditions proposed by the union. Only the number of people has not been confirmed. Here are the details:</p>
<p>Overthrowing the Original Conditions: Since the preparatory committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union accepted the entrustment of the Wusong ship workers, it proposed to reject the resolution conditions signed by the Guangdong Seamen's Industrial Federation Branch and Taikoo Company in early December of last year. After repeated consultations, the company has abandoned the original method and sincerely stepped back, willing to accept and discuss the conditions re-proposed by the union.</p>
<p>The Company Has Accepted: The Seamen's Union believed that the negotiations in this case were approaching a conclusion, so it formulated five draft items at the executive supervisory committee meeting (the general idea is: (1) compensate for all losses, (2) reinstate all workers, (3) hand over the missing worker Gao Kunquan, (4) no similar incidents will occur in the future, (5) pay the living expenses of the needy workers). Secretaries Hou Dachun and Sun Luping repeatedly consulted with the company authorities. The company has not yet decided on the number of people, but it has largely accepted the rest.</p>
<p>Guangdong Seamen Support: The Seamen's Middle Class Guild previously sent standing committee member Wang Oumin and Wusong ship worker representative Gao Yongliu to Guangdong to assist the Guangdong union with negotiations. Now that this case has been changed to be negotiated by the Seamen's General Union in Shanghai, they returned to Shanghai on the Taikoo Taiyuan ship the day before yesterday. According to the representative, the Guangdong seamen supported the Wusong ship workers' rejection of the original settlement and the union's settlement. If necessary, they will continue to support the General Union in dealing with it. Seamen in various places also sympathize.</p>
<h3>Yuanfeng Meifeng</h3>
<p>Two Silk Factories Shut Down Dispute</p>
<p>Regarding the shutdown dispute of the Yuanfeng and Meifeng silk factories, the employees of the two factories had previously petitioned the Bureau of Social Affairs and requested the bureau to mediate. The petition briefly stated that the Meifeng silk factory was located on Haizhou Road, Yangshupu, in the Public Concession and had been in operation for more than seven years. The Yuanfeng factory was located on Quzhenren Road in South Shanghai and had also been in operation for about three years. Both factories were founded by wealthy merchants such as Ni Dachun. The two factories had a total of more than 600 employees, and the business was still considered good. However, the factory owner, Ni Dachun (owner of Ni Jinfeng Silk Shop), suddenly posted a notice on December 31, 1933, announcing the shutdown of the business, sealing off all departments of the two factories, ordering employees to leave, and reporting to the Yangshupu police station, which sent Chinese and Western detectives as if facing a major enemy. Around 2:00 PM that afternoon, two workers from the Meifeng factory, Li Yuanchun and Wang Xianyue, planned to enter the factory to retrieve their belongings, but unexpectedly, Li and Wang were detained in the police station. Fortunately, after inquiring about the details, they were released immediately (omission). The petitioners served the two factories and usually worked diligently, with no small achievements. However, the factory owner Ni Dachun called them to come and dismissed them at will. He himself possessed tens of thousands of assets, enjoyed wealth and honor, while the petitioners maintained their lives through labor, with no food at home. Since the closure of the factory, all have been unemployed, their wives and children weeping, in a miserable state. In this severe winter, they are hungry and cold, and they will inevitably end up in ditches and become starving corpses. Their lives are not guaranteed, which is heartbreaking. The factory owner Ni Dachun's announcement of the shutdown was nothing more than the reason of business losses, but the economy of the two factories has never been public. Years ago, it was heard that the profits were extremely huge. Now he suddenly said that there were losses and suddenly closed down, which was obviously with ulterior motives and deliberately destructive (there are many questions about the price of silk coming in and out and sales, etc.). Also, according to the law, the shutdown of the factory should have been approved by your bureau in advance, but the two factories shut down without approval, with no employees in mind, not even your bureau, and disregarding the law, which is difficult to escape blame. Moreover, the petitioners have served the two factories for many years. According to the law, the termination of the contract should also be notified in advance. However, the factory did not notify in advance or dismiss them afterwards. Suddenly, at the end of the national calendar year, they were all ordered to leave the factory and stop working. The petitioners were like a bolt from the blue, not knowing what to do, displaced, and unable to appeal. For this reason, it is inevitable to ask your bureau to mediate according to the law and send personnel to investigate and order the factory to operate as usual to maintain their lives. Otherwise, request that each person be given a dissolution fee of one year's salary to relieve their hardship and warn the illegal.</p>
<h3>Pseudo-National Tourist Group Leaves Shanghai</h3>
<p>Not a Single Person in Shanghai Joins</p>
<p>A pseudo-organization fostered by the Japanese, the so-called "Manchukuo" tourist group, came to Shanghai on the second day of the New Year holiday to inspect, with a total of seventy-four people, touring in two batches. They all left Shanghai by the 7th. The so-called Manchukuo tourist group had a total of</p>
<h3>Seventy-Four People: "The core members are pseudo-national officials" in construction, industry</h3>
<p>Commerce, education, journalism, etc. Their starting points include Changchun, Jilin, Shenyang, Dalian, Tieling, and Yingkou. They arrived in Shanghai on the Fengtian Maru ship on January 2. By the 4th, sixty-four of them had left Shanghai on the original ship back to the Northeast. The main figures in the group were</p>
<h3>Pseudo-National Officials: Japanese Shintani Baoichi, Fujilai, Guan Hengtai</h3>
<p>That is, Sangshi Xunfu, and Inoue Sumu, a member of the Finance Section of the Kanto Office of the Ministry of Communications. In addition, there were fourteen people from the Mantetsu Company and four from the Dalian Kisha Company. After these people arrived in Shanghai, ten of them went to inspect Nan Yi and other places and planned to travel to the Yangtze River. The entire group, initially with sixty-four members in Shanghai, only stayed for two days before returning to Dalian first. The remaining ten people, after arriving in Nanjing, suddenly turned back to Shanghai without going to the Yangtze River, and purchased passenger seats on the Dalian Maru from the Dalian Kisha Company. On the 7th, they</p>

<h3>Xinwei Relief Society</h3>
<p>Agrees to Allocate Cotton Clothing for Prisoners</p>
<p>The Shanghai Xinwei Relief Society recently received a letter from the Jiangsu Second Prison Office requesting alms of cotton clothing to give to prisoners to ward off the severe cold. The society has allocated 50 sets of cotton clothing from its existing stock. A reply letter was sent yesterday, which reads, "In response, we have just received your letter, and we have heard everything. We have already allocated all 50 sets of cotton clothing that were requested in your previous letter, and we have sent a letter to inform you. I think we would like to see you. Now there is nothing left. Except for waiting for continued fundraising, we will consider helping again. I should reply accordingly, hoping you will check and follow up."</p>
<h3>China Aviation Company Shanghai-Guangdong Plane</h3>

The discharged personnel, including Xu Bojian, Yang Songhe, Zhang Shunfeng, Yang Mingxin, etc., expressed their gratitude for being injured this time. According to the company's regulations, the company is originally not responsible for accidents to passengers. Now, China Aviation Company has broken the rules and treated them favorably, undertaking all medical expenses. Yesterday, a letter was sent to the company to express gratitude.</p>
<h3>Twelve Organizations Prepare</h3>
<p>Memorial Service for Mr. Yao Zirang</p>
<p>Mr. Yao Zirang, a respected elder, was admired for his learning and morals, and his integrity and strength made him the sole voice of the people. Throughout his life, he led all circles and devoted himself to national and local affairs for sixty years. Unfortunately, on the afternoon of December 26, 1933, he died without illness due to old age and exhaustion. News of his passing brought deep sorrow. The Shanghai Charity Association, the Nanshi Fire Brigade, the Defense Corps, the China Vocational Education Society, and other twelve organizations believe that the gentleman has contributed to the world, and in admiration of the former sages, there should be some expression. A memorial service was initiated to express mourning. The preparation office is temporarily located in the China Vocational School in Lujiabang, Nanshi.</p>
<p>The first preparatory meeting was held the day before yesterday, and it was decided to hold the second preparatory meeting again at 4:00 PM on the 16th of this month, intending to publicly and privately posthumously confer an honorable title on the gentleman and discuss memorial methods.</p>
<h3>Shanxi Industrialists</h3>
<p>Visit Shanghai National Products Company</p>
<p>All Praised the Spirit of Promoting Women's National Products Year</p>
<p>Shanxi industrialists Yang Xiaoyuan, Yu Luncai, and Mr. Nie and others, more than ten people, this time representing Baojin, Guangmao, and Shanxi coal mining companies, and discussed transportation issues with the Ministry of Railways. They came to Shanghai recently. They heard that the Shanghai National Products Company was the earliest organization in Nanjing Road to promote national products, and its efforts were well-known. Yesterday, they went to visit, and Lu Qisheng, chairman of the Business Development Committee of the company, received them and sent personnel to accompany Zhao to visit various departments. Yang and others greatly admired the working spirit of the company's male and female employees and were particularly surprised by the prices of certain goods. For example, the electric-printed soft satin sold for three corners per foot, the velvet for one corner and four points per foot, and the three-star toothpaste for one corner and two points per piece, all cheap prices factored into the cost. Yang and others finished the visit and raised questions, Lu Jun said, This is the cheap and beautiful national products prescribed by the company every day, because this company is promoting the Women's National Products Year, hoping to create a record of national products companies that exceeds the National Products Year by more than ten times, After all, the record of the National Products Year last year, in Shanghai, only increased three companies that completely sold national products, and its capacity was very weak. Therefore, starting from the first month of this year, the company is prepared to sacrifice and engage in struggle, and specially selects high-quality and beautiful national products, which are particularly cheap and sold in parts every day, to introduce to the women's community of Shanghai, so that they know the cheapness and beauty of national products, in order to create their basic psychology of loving national products, so This cheap sale of national products, from the current business point of view, is a loss, but from the point of view of promoting the entire national products and promoting the women's national products year, it is a valuable sacrifice. The success of all undertakings comes from sacrifice. This company wants to hope for the success of the Women's National Products Year, and can't help but have this sacrifice. Yang Jun praised Lu Jun's spirit.</p>
<h3>Return Empty Items Handled with Joint Transportation</h3>
<p>The Railway Bureau's Vehicle Department Announced Yesterday</p>
<p>Scheduled to Take Effect on January 10</p>
<p>The Vehicle Department of the Two Railway Bureau issued a notice yesterday, saying, "It has been investigated that cargo owners are responsible for the goods themselves, and domestic combined transport is temporarily limited to whole vehicles. It has been ordered to follow in accordance with the Yingzi No. 256.14110 letter of December 9, 2022. However, it has been found that empty boxes, bags, baskets, etc., with the return empty item certificate issued by the starting station, can be transported back at half price. The tarpaulins and ropes provided by the cargo owner should be transported back free of charge. According to the regulations, the cargo owner should be responsible for it himself, and most of them are not full vehicles. If combined transportation is not handled, not only will the cargo merchants suffer losses, but also the combined transportation will be hindered. This railway is allowed to handle combined transportation for the return empty items, regardless of whether they are whole vehicles or not full vehicles, from January 10 of this year. It is also allowed to notify the Jinpu Railway that combined transportation has also been handled for the return empty items that are not full vehicles since December 21, 2022. It is necessary to notify and ask everyone to follow the guidelines."</p>
<h3>Ship Water Supply</h3>
<p>Should Be Purchased from Chinese Merchants</p>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday, which reads, "Now purchasing national products has become the duty that all citizens should fulfill. Regarding the water supply of all Chinese ships, Shanghai must have adopted the supply of our national water companies, or because of the convenience of the location, they still purchase water materials from non-Chinese water companies, I am afraid it is still unavoidable. The Shanghai Public Concession Water Company is dedicated to seeking its own interests, regardless of the increased burden on water users, and arbitrarily increases prices, and even cuts off water, putting people's lives in danger. Your meeting must know the tragic situation deeply. It is requested that your meeting forward a letter to the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association, asking all Chinese ships to purchase water from our national water companies in order to save profits. I hope you will check and handle it." It is heard that the City Chamber of Commerce has forwarded a letter to the shipping industry association advising them to use it.</p>
<h3>Mass Fundraising Convention for Leprosy Sanatorium</h3>

<h3>Walking Across the Country</h3>
<p>Exploration Team Requests Filing</p>
<p>Engaging in exploration, research, and other work,</p>
<p>Contributing the findings to the country and society.</p>
<p>Fang Dingyi and other students from Chengtian Middle School in this city, to engage in exploration and research across the country, initiated the organization of a "Walking Across the Country Exploration and Research Team." Yesterday, they submitted a request to the city party headquarters for filing to facilitate their departure. The original submission is recorded as follows: "Considering the vastness of our country, the large population, the richness of resources, and the fertility of the land, achieving prosperity and strength is within reach. However, since the opening of trade, the powers have been encircling us, watching with predatory eyes, all with the intention of encroachment. Recently, the September 18th Incident occurred first, followed by the January 28th Battle. The schemes of partition are becoming increasingly apparent, and the national situation is precarious. In addition, there are many border incidents, and alarming news is frequently heard. In this critical time of survival, when the tide is about to turn, voices of national salvation are rising from all directions. Some advocate promoting industry, some advocate promoting agriculture, and some advocate promoting education. Each holds their own views, and there is no consensus. It must be understood that the path to saving the nation and ensuring survival cannot be achieved by mere empty rhetoric, nor can it be achieved by the power of a single individual. The fundamental solution is to thoroughly examine the actual conditions of the country, identify its advantages and disadvantages, weigh its priorities, and coordinate an overall plan to save it from danger. The initial step lies in examining the situation in various places, including political conditions, public sentiment, local customs, education levels, various local resources, and the abundance of natural resources. All must be carefully investigated to provide a reference for the foundation of national revitalization. With this understanding, Dingyi and others have specifically gathered comrades to initiate the organization of a 'Walking Across the Country Exploration and Research Team.' With the ambition of saving the nation, we are willing to engage in exploration and research, and in the future, we will contribute the findings to the country and society to serve as the basis for reform and revitalization. Therefore, we are submitting this document with the reasons for the initiation, the resumes of the initiators, the team charter, and the itinerary map to your esteemed office for review. We humbly request your approval and permission for the organization to achieve its full potential. We eagerly await your response. We respectfully request your approval for the convenience of the public."</p>
<h3>Salvation Army</h3>
<p>Chief of Staff Mabbutt Departs for China</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that the Salvation Army's Chief of Staff, Mabbutt, departed from Victoria Station in London on December 1st for the Far East. He plans to visit the Dutch East Indies, China, Korea, Japan, and other places during his journey, which will last about four months. It is noted that the Salvation Army has many leprosy districts in the Dutch East Indies, and the Dutch East Indies government now wishes to expand this undertaking, offering the army land that is more than four times the size of its current holdings. The army's work in China is headquartered in Peiping and extends to Guangzhou and Hong Kong, and it now intends to broadcast throughout southern China. The army also has operations in Manchuria, which are managed by the Peiping headquarters and are also to be expanded. However, the Japanese Salvation Army headquarters has now requested that this responsibility be transferred to them. Therefore, Mabbutt plans to personally visit Manchuria to negotiate a solution.</p>

<h3>Chiang Kai-shek Requests Award for Chinese and Western Pharmacy</h3>
<p>During last year's anti-Japanese war in North China, which coincided with the height of summer heat and the prevalence of epidemics, the Chinese and Western Pharmacy on Fourth Avenue in this city, recognizing the soldiers' sacrifices for the country, donated a large batch of medicines, such as medicated brandy, Ling Bao Dan, and Red God Pill, to the Peiping Military Commission Branch for distribution to the front-line soldiers. Recently, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Director He of the Military Commission Branch praised the pharmacy for its righteousness and courage, sending a letter to the pharmacy stating, "Your dedication to public service, shared hatred of the enemy, noble integrity, and lofty character are worthy of admiration. We intend to request a commendation in accordance with regulations to recognize your generous act and to establish a model for the people of the country." The pharmacy believes that resisting Japan is the duty of all Chinese people and therefore politely declined the award.</p>
<h3>Business Talk of China General Omnibus Company</h3>
<p>Last Year's Electric Lights Earned Over One Million Yuan</p>
<p>The China General Omnibus Company previously undertook the task of consolidating and replacing the tracks of various tram lines, such as those on Min'guo Road and Zhonghua Road, with cement baseboards, sleepers, and steel rails. The project on Min'guo Road has already been completed, and the work on Zhonghua Road began yesterday, starting from Laoximen. This project is expected to take about a year to complete. The raw materials used in this project were purchased from abroad, and the steel rails currently being laid are exceptionally strong and durable. The estimated cost of materials and construction is over 800,000 yuan. It is also reported that the company's business last year (1933) did not yield a profit for the tram service, but the electric light business was quite prosperous, with an estimated profit of over one million yuan.</p>

<p>Pregnant Woman, Child, and Midwife All Safe</p>
<p>Chen Guisheng, a Ningbo native residing at No. 18 Luoxiang Local House in the Pudong district of Shanghai, works at a Yangshupu cotton mill. His hard work provides enough for a comfortable life. His wife, Chen Sunshi, 25 years old, was due to give birth and hired a midwife, Ms. He, to assist with the delivery. They also lit a coal stove for warmth. However, the house was small and cramped, without windows. Suddenly, Guisheng's sister, Zhu Yuan, entered the room after shopping and saw her sister-in-law lying stiffly on the bed, while the midwife and neighboring women who were helping were slumped over, as if drunk. Shocked, she cried for help. Fortunately, neighbors called female doctors Qian Shuzhen, Yuan Huiyu, and Xu Cuizhen from the Hongkou Civilian Obstetrics Hospital, who rushed to the scene and diagnosed coal gas poisoning. The midwife's ignorance almost caused a tragedy. However, thanks to the swift rescue, everyone was saved. The baby was also resuscitated. The lives of several people were preserved, which can be said to be a narrow escape.</p>

<h3>Automobile Rental Association Consolidates Membership Base</h3>
<p>Paying a Security Deposit Exempts Vehicle from Seizure for Damages</p>
<p>Last summer, members of the city's automobile rental industry collectively sent a letter to their association, which was forwarded to the relevant authorities, requesting that vehicles involved in accidents be exempted from seizure to alleviate the industry's difficulties. The Public Security Bureau, Public Works Bureau, and Social Affairs Bureau jointly discussed and decided to approve the request, provided that third-party insurance was purchased to ensure compensation for losses. Subsequently, the association held more than ten meetings over several months and replaced the third-party insurance with a savings security deposit of ten yuan per vehicle per quarter, paid for five years. This has been approved by the relevant authorities. The association issues a certificate, which serves as a basis for obtaining a license and instructs the local district offices and all members to comply. Thereafter, all white-plate commercial vehicles involved in accidents will be exempt from seizure and will be provided with various effective guarantees. This will also create a strong and united organization. From now on, the association's affairs can be rectified, and all difficulties can be resolved easily. Therefore, starting from the 4th of this month, the association has established a collection office within the Shanghai City Bank. A few people were panicked, thinking that this would no longer allow them to move freely, and made dangerous remarks. Fortunately, enlightened people, sympathetic to the intentions of those who handled the matter, explained it well, and this kind of move will not become a reality.</p>

<h3>Shanghai-Peiping Train Passengers</h3>
<p>Limit on Carrying Cash</p>
<p>All Limited to Three Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>Freight Calculated According to Passenger Transport Regulations</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations received Instruction No. 7913 from the Ministry of Railways yesterday: "The Tianjin-Pukou Railway Administration recently submitted a report stating that the Chief of the Second Section of the Traffic Department reported that Item 6 of the Section Meeting in November proposed that cash be allowed on the Shanghai-Peiping train, but with restrictions. The reasons are as follows: Passengers on our railway carrying small amounts of cash can purchase tickets according to regulations and carry them on the train for safekeeping. However, since the Shanghai-Peiping train replaced the Peiping-Pukou train, all cash is no longer transported by the train, causing inconvenience to passengers. It is inevitable that</p>
<h3>Passengers Will Carry Cash</h3>
<p>Onto the Train Privately. If discovered, not only will the passengers be punished, but the railway staff will also be held responsible for dereliction of duty. If the cash is concealed carefully and difficult to detect, the staff will be deceived, and the railway bureau will be affected in terms of revenue, which is not appropriate. For the sake of expediency, it is proposed that the amount of cash carried by passengers on this train be limited to 3,000 or 5,000 yuan. After purchasing a ticket, the passengers will be responsible for their own cash to avoid theft and facilitate travel. After discussion, it was decided that it is not very convenient to load large amounts of cash at the Shanghai-Peiping train station. However, it is permissible for passengers to carry small amounts of cash for use. It is possible to set a limit and allow tickets to be purchased for amounts below 5,000 yuan, with the owners responsible for loading and transporting the cash. Please instruct the department to review and approve the record for compliance." Based on this, it was found that it is not very convenient to transport large amounts of cash on the Shanghai-Peiping train. However, it is permissible for passengers to carry small amounts of cash for their own use, and it is possible to impose a limit of less than 5,000 yuan, allow them to purchase tickets, and have the owners take care of the loading and transportation themselves. It should be determined whether joint transportation miscellaneous tickets can be purchased for cash carried by Allied passengers. It is recommended to consult with the relevant railway authorities first before instructing the stations to comply. Regarding how to handle the matter, a report is submitted for review and approval. Based on this, it is inevitable that passengers will carry small amounts of cash. If all cash is prohibited, it will cause great inconvenience to passengers. It is proposed that the amount of cash that passengers are allowed to carry be limited to less than 5,000 yuan, a miscellaneous ticket be issued, freight be collected, and the passengers be responsible for carrying it themselves. However, the Shanghai-Peiping train does not handle baggage and other transportation. Should this exception be allowed, and what is the limit? It is recommended that your department issue regulations for each railway to comply with to ensure consistency. Please submit a report for review and approval. Based on this, the cash carried by passengers on the Shanghai-Peiping train should be limited to 3,000 yuan, and freight should be collected in accordance with Item A of Article 107 of the Passenger Transport Regulations. In accordance with Article 108, the passengers will bear the risk. The crossing fee should be handled in accordance with Instruction No. 6992 of this department. In addition to issuing instructions and distributing them separately, it is hereby ordered that the railway comply with these regulations and report back as necessary. This order.</p>
<h3>Passenger Transport Regulations</h3>
<p>Item A of Article 107 of the original text states that currency, gold and silver, and gold leaf are calculated according to value.</p>
<p>For every 1,000 yuan or less, the freight rate is calculated as follows: 1.8 yuan within 150 kilometers, 2.1 yuan from 150 kilometers to 300 kilometers, 2.4 yuan from 300 kilometers to 450 kilometers, 2.6 yuan from 450 kilometers to 600 kilometers, 2.75 yuan from 600 kilometers to 750 kilometers, 2.8 yuan from 750 kilometers to 900 kilometers, and 1.0 yuan should be added for every 150 kilometers or less beyond 900 kilometers. Furthermore, Instruction No. 6992 of the Ministry of Railways stipulates that the crossing fee for banknotes is 0.2 yuan per 1,000 yuan or less, with a minimum of 2 yuan. The crossing fee for gold and silver currency is 1 yuan per 1,000 yuan or less, with a minimum of 2 yuan.</p>
<h3>Pei Fuxing at the Silk Industry Bank</h3>
<p>Discussing China's Past Diplomatic Policies</p>
<p>Car Causes Accident, Fails to Stop</p>
<p>Wheels Run Over Body, Head Separated</p>
<p>Head and Neck Severed in Two</p>
<p>Fresh Blood Splatters, Instant Death</p>
<p>丨Rare and Tragic Car Accident in Shanghai丨</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 2:00 PM, a man, dressed in a blue cloth short shirt and pants, with an old grayish-brown overcoat, resembling a worker, about thirty years old, was walking near Tiantong'an Road and Jiangwan Road when a truck suddenly sped up behind him. Upon hearing the truck, the man quickly moved to the side of the road to avoid it. However, the truck was going too fast, and the man was unable to dodge in time, and was knocked down by the truck. The truck driver did not brake after the accident but continued driving forward. As a result, the front wheel of the truck ran over the man's neck, severing his head and neck in two. Fresh blood spurted out, and he died instantly. The passersby were in uproar. The nearby police officers also arrived upon hearing the news and immediately detained the driver, taking him to the police station to await trial by the court. As the deceased's family could not be found, the body was temporarily placed by the roadside, covered with straw mats, awaiting notification to the local bailiff and an inspection by the court this morning before coffin arrangements are made.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Industry Bank at 64 Hankou Road, to promote the academic knowledge of its staff, organized an academic lecture series. The other day, Mr. Pei Fuxing, president of the National Business College, was specially invited to give a lecture entitled "A Review of China's Past Diplomatic Policies." Attendance tickets were distributed to colleagues in various banks beforehand, so the audience was quite large. Mr. Pei's demeanor during the lecture was calm, and his words were insightful and pertinent. The text of his speech is recorded below: Everyone, I am very honored to be invited by Mr. Yan Song to participate in this grand gathering today. Now, I will discuss the topic of "A Review of China's Past Diplomatic Policies" with you. (1) The Establishment of Diplomatic Policies: The diplomatic policies of various countries differ from each other. There are roughly two reasons for these differences: A. The different geographical environments of each country. The diplomatic policies of a continental country are different from those of a maritime country, and the same goes for coastal countries versus landlocked countries. For example, Russia is located in the Arctic and lacks good military ports. Therefore, during the imperial era, it tried its best to seize seaports in the southeast and southwest as naval bases. So, its diplomatic policy at that time was centered on this. For example, England is an island country, but its colonies are scattered around the globe. Therefore, its diplomatic policy in the 18th and 19th centuries was to compete for maritime hegemony, relying on its strong naval power to protect its colonies distributed everywhere. When the Washington Conference was held in 1925, it advocated that the British navy should at least have the power to subdue the navies of any two major powers. For example, the United States is a newly established country in the Americas, fearing that its foundations were not solid and that European powers would interfere in internal affairs of the Americas, so it used the Monroe Doctrine as a firm shield. B. The different populations and resources of various countries. The size of the population and the amount of resources are extremely important to a country. For example, England is a commercial and industrial country, and its agricultural products are insufficient for its own use. If a war breaks out, it must first have convenient transportation to supply food to avoid famine. Therefore, it advocates not blockading the seaports of belligerent countries during wartime. This is the so-called "freedom of the seas" issue. For example, the United States, because its agricultural products are very abundant, advocates strict inspection of merchant ships on the oceans to implement the so-called "maritime hegemony," so diplomatic policies also differ. (2) China's Diplomacy Before the Opium War: The Era of "No Policy" China monopolized the East for thousands of years, closed itself off, had primitive science, undeveloped transportation, and was surrounded by small and insignificant states, without the intrusion of European and American nations. Therefore, there was no so-called diplomatic policy throughout the dynasties. The most notable events were nothing more than goodwill relations with foreign barbarians, such as Zhang Qian's mission to the Western Regions and Zheng He's voyages to the South Seas. At the end of the 19th century, a British delegation came to China, requesting to send ambassadors to each other. The Qing court considered England to be an uncivilized barbarian and greatly despised them, so it refused. In 1816, the British representative Amherst arrived in Beijing to meet Emperor Qianlong, requesting trade. At that time, the Qing court sent a reply in the form of a national letter to the British Emperor George X, which mostly contained threatening words and commanding tones, showing the arrogance of the Qing court at that time. Due to the Qing court's ignorance and arrogance, it aroused the resentment of various countries, forming a united front. The Opium War of 1839 broke out as a result. China was defeated and concluded many unequal treaties. Various countries enjoyed various special rights in China. This was the first great shame in Chinese diplomatic history and was also the result of having no diplomatic policy. (3) Diplomacy from the Opium War to 1915: The Era of Submissive Policy After the Opium War, China repeatedly fought against various countries in the East and West, such as the Anglo-French Allied Forces War, the Sino-French War, the Sino-Japanese War, and the Eight-Nation Alliance War. China's weaknesses became increasingly apparent, and the major powers' contempt for China deepened. More unequal treaties were signed, land was lost, and rights were forfeited. The government, intimidated by military power, surrendered and dared not resist, allowing the major powers to take whatever they wanted to prolong their survival. The nation's self-confidence was almost completely lost. In 1915, Japan went further and forced the recognition of the Twenty-One Demands. At this time, the result of the submissive policy was that the country had entered a state of irreversible decline. (4) Diplomacy from 1915 to the Tanggu Truce: The Era of Passive Resistance Policy In 1914, the outbreak of the European War gave small and weak nations an excellent opportunity. If China could have strived to strengthen itself at this time, it could have been revived. Unfortunately, the government at the time was mediocre and lacked any achievements, instead submitting to the harsh Twenty-One Demands. Therefore, intellectuals realized that the national crisis was imminent and loudly called out to awaken the masses. As a result, national consciousness gradually rose, and revolutionary ideas surged. In addition, the failure of China's negotiations at the Paris Peace Conference led to the outbreak of the famous May Fourth Movement. On the one hand, reforms occurred in culture, and on the other hand, efforts were made to resist the shackles of imperialism and seek national self-reliance. Since then, the people of the whole country have been working hard to passively resist foreign aggression. The most famous examples are the various tariff conferences, demanding tariff autonomy, and negotiating with various countries to abolish consular jurisdiction. However, there was a shortcoming at that time, which was a fondness for high-sounding words and empty talk. For example, the slogan "Down with Imperialism" was shouted loudly, which did not help in practice but instead aroused the resentment of various countries, and the united front of various countries was completed again. Therefore, at the successive legal rights conferences, various countries evaded each other on the issue of abolishing consular jurisdiction and refused to budge. At that time, Chinese diplomacy had fallen into isolation. Since the Middle East Road Incident occurred, and China and Russia went to war, diplomatic relations between the two countries were severed, and China was completely isolated in the international community. Therefore, Japan dared to invade Manchuria in 1931 and then attack it the following year. At that time, the government and the people, on the one hand, worked hard to seek domestic unity, and on the other hand, carried out passive resistance and appealed to the League of Nations. Although it could not force the Japanese army to withdraw, the League of Nations' successive resolutions and the investigation team's report gave Japan a kind of moral sanction. Later, the Shanghai War ended, and the signing of the truce did not result in any major loss of rights for China. The effect of this passive resistance policy was not very great. (5) Future Diplomatic Policy: Since the signing of the Tanggu Truce, diplomatic policy seems to have changed again. Now, let us ask, if Japan invades Peiping, Tianjin, and Chahar again, or encourages Puyi to declare himself emperor, or attempts to invade Inner Mongolia, does our country have sufficient strength to resist? If England invades Tibet, France attacks Yunnan, Russia occupies Outer Mongolia and Xinjiang, and Japan disturbs the coastal provinces, does our country have any strength to resist? Now, the morale of the Chinese people is depressed, and everyone thinks that there is no hope for national affairs, and that being a semi-colony is a done deal. This reflects this mentality, and I am afraid that future diplomatic policy will return to the era of submission. But we must know that the failure of diplomacy in the past was due to the failure to actively implement diplomatic policies. Let us ask, have we implemented the policy of "uniting with the nations of the world that treat us equally to fight together" that Sun Yat-sen showed us? For example, Russia and Germany are nations that treat us equally, but our country has no contact with them. Diplomacy falls into isolation, so how can it not fail? I hope that the Chinese people will not give up on themselves and stop thinking about revitalizing on the one hand, and on the other hand, must get rid of the habit of arrogance, eliminate prejudices and emotional effects, work hard to explore the national conditions of various countries and the general trend of the world, and unite with small and weak nations to fight together. Only in this way can China's diplomatic policy move from submission to passive resistance and then to the era of active resistance. Only then can China be saved.</p>
<h3>Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities</h3>
<p>Completes Plan to Unify All Power Plants in the City</p>
<p>Plan Divided into Two Steps, Gradually Implemented Over Six Years, Recently Fully Completed, Lines Form a Large Electrical Network</p>
<p>Great Benefits for Economy, Technology, and Management</p>
<p>The local newspapers recently published news about the connection of power lines in Nanshi and Zhabei and the realization of the Greater Shanghai electrical grid. The reporter believes that this matter is of great importance to the development of the Greater Shanghai electrical industry, and specially inquired the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities for details. According to the person in charge of the bureau, the connection of power lines in Nanshi and Zhabei is part of the Public Utilities Bureau's plan to unify all power plants in the city. This plan was formulated as early as 1928, and has been gradually implemented since then, and has only recently been fully completed. The implementation situation is briefly described below.</p>
<h3>Plan Overview</h3>
<p>Shanghai is the largest city in China, so the development of its electrical industry is also the fastest. In addition to the foreign-operated electric companies in the Special District, there are six Chinese-operated companies: Zhabei Water and Electricity Company in Zhabei, Huashang Electric Company in Nanshi, Pudong Electric Company in Pudong, as well as Xianghua Electric Company, Wusong Baoming Electric Company, and Zhenru Electric Company. (After the January 28 Incident, Baoming Company merged with Zhabei Company, so there are now five.) The capital of each company varies, the scale varies, and the situation has always been very complex. At the beginning of its establishment, the Public Utilities Bureau realized that the separation of power plants was not economical and that the new trend of electrical grids in various countries around the world, so it examined the current situation of each plant and formulated a plan to unify all power plants in the city in the spring of 1928. The steps can be divided into two: (1) Stop power plant generation, and instead purchase electricity from large power plants for resale, so that the city's power generation work is concentrated in the two major Chinese power plants in Zhabei. (2) The two major Chinese power plants in Zhabei are further interconnected through Huxi and Pudong, so that the city's high-voltage lines form a ring.</p>
<h3>Implementation Situation</h3>
<p>Since the Public Utilities Bureau determined the above unification plan, it has guided various electric companies to implement it step by step. Zhenru Electric Company, the smallest in scale, first purchased electricity from Zhabei Company in October 1928. The next was Xianghua Electric Company, which also started purchasing electricity from Zhabei Company in January 1930. The next was Pudong Electric Company, which laid underwater cables in the Huangpu River to connect to the Huashang Electric Company in Puxi, and started purchasing electricity from Huashang Company in March 1931. Thus, there was electrical connection between Pudong and Puxi. As for Wusong Baoming Company, which is very close to the new Zhabei power plant, it also started purchasing electricity from Zhabei Company in May 1931. By this point, the first step of the unified power plant plan had been completed. However, Pudong Company has a large area. In order to reduce line losses and prevent underwater cables from easily malfunctioning, in addition to connecting with Huashang Company, it was also necessary to connect with Zhabei Company. Therefore, another underwater cable was laid between the intersection of Jungong Road and Wuquan Road in Puxi and Taojiazhai in Pudong, and connected to the power lines of Zhabei Company, which was implemented in February 1933. Electricity was purchased from Zhabei Company in separate installments. This is the process of realizing the first step of the plan.</p>
<h3>Plan Completion</h3>
<p>As for the second step of the plan, it is the connection between the two major Chinese power plants in Zhabei and Huashang. This connection was determined after a long period of research. That is, a 33,000-volt high-voltage main line was built along Zhongshan Road in Huxi to connect the north and south, and a main transformer substation was built at the intersection of Zhongshan Road and Xietu Road as a place for both parties to mutually supply electricity. The construction of this high-voltage line and main transformer substation is the most important project in the unified power plant plan, and it is also the last step in realizing this plan, which is extremely important. This project was completed at the end of 1931, and was officially energized on January 4, 1934. By this point, the Public Utilities Bureau's plan to unify all power plants in the city has been fully completed. Looking at the current situation of power supply in the city, the power generation centers are located in the northern part of the city, which is the Jiansongqiao power plant of Zhabei Company, and in the southern part of the city, which is the Chezhan Road power plant of Huashang Company. The connection lines between the two plants pass through Huxi and Pudong, forming a ring. The companies that purchase electricity for resale are all supplied by this ring line. Both power plants also have considerable connections with the foreign companies in the Special District. It has already completed a large electrical network. The completion of this plan has great benefits in terms of economy, technology, and management. However, the situation is complex and cannot be fully described in a short time.</p>
<h3>French Concession Police Break Up</h3>
<p>Large-Scale Poison Pill Factory</p>
<p>Worth Over 200,000, Shocking</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Only Two People Were Caught, Sent to the Second Special Court for Trial</p>
<p>The French Concession police authorities have recently noted that the atmosphere of drugs in Shanghai has been rampant and has not diminished, harming the people greatly. Therefore, they have ordered the Chinese and Western detectives in their respective police stations to strictly investigate and suppress drug-related activities. Although they have often broken up private trafficking and private manufacturing drug factories, arresting the perpetrators and sending them to court for heavy penalties and fines in order to eliminate the source of drugs and eliminate the scourge, however, some people who disregard the law still dare to secretly set up factories, secretly manufacture, and sell them in the city. The chief of Western detectives has issued a notice assigning detectives to each road and street in the Concession to manage and strictly investigate. Yesterday morning, Jin Jiulin, the chief inspector of the special agency, received a tip that someone had privately set up a huge factory for manufacturing red and white pills in a house at No. 289 on Baier Road, Nanyang Bridge, with strong capital and employing workers day and night. Therefore, Chief Inspector Jin, at around 9:00 AM, led Detective Zhang Ziying, Deputy Detectives Zhou Buguang and Jiang Changwen, and Detective Ma Yizhi, quietly went to the address. First, they guarded the front and back doors of the factory to prevent the perpetrators from escaping, and then rushed in to search. Unfortunately, the workers had already stopped working and left work, leaving only Zhang Xingsheng, also known as A Jin, from Pudong (30 years old) and Jiang Laidao (26 years old) from Nantong inside. They were immediately arrested. Eighty-six large packages of red pills, 65 pounds of morphine, and raw material powders and manufacturing equipment motors and other items that had not been mixed were seized, with a total value of more than 200,000 gold, loaded into a large truck, and taken to the police station to await delivery to the Second Special District Court for trial today. At the same time, the main perpetrators and workers were being investigated and interrogated.</p>
<h3>Tang Jiapeng Assassination Case</h3>
<p>Culprit Scheduled for Sentencing</p>
<p>Tang Jiapeng, also known as A Yu, the former manager of the Yongji Game Hall in the Great World, was assassinated and killed last summer. A passerby was also killed by stray bullets at the same time. The French Concession police arrested two perpetrators, Zhang Tinggui, also known as Zhang Xiaosizi, from Funing, and Zhao Guangfu from Yangzhou, and also recovered a Browning pistol used by Zhao to kill Tang. They were sent to the Second Special District Court for prosecution. After repeated court hearings and investigations, the police firearms technicians compared the eight bullet casings collected by the police at the scene of Tang's murder with Zhao's pistol. It was confirmed that three bullets were fired from the pistol held by Zhao. This case had already been argued and was scheduled for sentencing. However, the presiding judge Wu Fanglian had doubts about whether the several bullets extracted from Tang's body by the doctor at the time were fired from Zhao's pistol. For the sake of caution, he announced the reopening of the debate. The details have been recorded in the previous newspaper. Yesterday, Judge Wu presided over the First Criminal Court to continue the trial. At that time, Zhao suddenly denied firing the gun again, but the police had proved that the bullets and bullet casings all had numbers and that they were verified to have been fired from the pistol held by Zhao. They requested that the law be enforced. The court then appointed lawyer Tang Hao to debate with the police lawyer on the spot. After the debate, the court announced the end of the debate and scheduled the sentencing for 10:00 AM on the 13th (Saturday). The defendants were still remanded in custody pending further instructions.</p>
<h3>Fudan University Student Li Linheng</h3>
<p>Beats Teahouse Employee to Death and Flees</p>
<p>Public Security Bureau Orders Arrest</p>
<p>Huang Ru, a teahouse employee at Fudan University in Jiangwan, from Yangzhou, was 45 years old. He was married to a woman surnamed [illegible], and had two sons. He lived at No. 2 Songjiang Road, behind the school gate. Around 8:00 PM the other night, Li Linheng, a student at the school from Guangdong, ordered Huang to fetch water. Huang took a little longer to fetch the water, which angered Li. At first, they argued verbally, and then they started fighting. Huang was unwilling to be weak and resisted, leading to a conflict. Li was young and strong, and punched Huang hard in the chest. As a result, Huang was severely injured. Huang returned home in pain and soon lost consciousness. He died of breathlessness late at night. Huang's son reported the incident to Dai Hongen, the chief of the Fifth District and Fifth Precinct of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, who quickly dispatched patrol officers to arrest the murderer. However, Li Linheng had already fled in fear of punishment and disappeared without a trace. A report was submitted to the headquarters for record, and each district and precinct was requested to arrest the fugitive and bring him to justice. At the same time, the local bailiff was ordered to report the body to the court for examination.</p>
<h3>Extremely Bored, Wildly Imaginative</h3>
<p>Uses Alias to Send Letters Demanding Extortion</p>
<p>Threatens Kidnapping if Not Allowed</p>
<p>Evil Plan Fails, Culprit Arrested</p>
<p>Zhu Genhe, a Suzhou native, is 28 years old and lives at No. 53 Xinmadeli, Racecourse Road. Recently, he has been unemployed for a long time and has been impoverished in Shanghai. He had a wild idea and, using the alias Wang Xiaogen, wrote four threatening letters from the 1st to the 7th of this month to Wei Aibao, a fellow villager living at No. 60 Yongzheng Lane, Avenue Edward VII, intending to extort 3,000 yuan. He threatened to kidnap Wei's two children if she did not comply. After receiving the letters, Wei reported the situation to the General Inspectorate and requested an investigation. Chief Inspector Lu Liankui ordered Detective Liu Shaokui, Song Bingzheng, and Detective Liu Zhaonian to handle the case. After several days of secret investigation, they found some clues. Surprisingly, the other day, Zhu Genhe suddenly went to the Qinghe Inn in Qinghe Lane, Guangdong Road, and opened room No. 121. Still using the alias Wang Xiaogen, he wrote a letter and asked the teahouse employee Zhou Asi to send it to Wei Aibao, asking for 300 yuan and waiting for a reply. Zhou, unaware of the situation, went to Wei's house at No. 60 Yongzheng Lane according to the address on the letter. He was arrested by the detectives. The letter was opened, and the amount of money demanded had been reduced from 3,000 yuan to 300 yuan. They took Zhou to the police station. Under interrogation, they learned that Zhou was a teahouse employee who had been ordered to deliver the letter and was not involved in the case. They took Zhou directly to the Qinghe Inn to arrest Zhu. However, Zhu had already fled upon hearing the news. Zhou was released and ordered to assist in the arrest of Zhu Genhe. Around midnight the other night, Zhou learned that Zhu was hiding at home and quickly twisted Zhu up and called two Chinese policemen, No. 1961 and No. 1974, to arrest Zhu and take him to the Xinzha Police Station. They reported to the police chief, who ordered him to be detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer Jiang Baolian gave a detailed account of the case, stating that although the defendant had confessed at the police station, it was still necessary to continue the investigation, so he requested that Zhu Genhe be detained. The teahouse employee Zhou Asi from the Qinghe Inn testified that Zhu came to open the room yesterday and asked me to deliver the letter. When questioned, Zhu Genhe admitted to writing letters to Wei Aibao to borrow money, but claimed that he had known Wei for a long time and only took this desperate measure because he was extremely bored. After reviewing the testimony, Judge Wu Tingqi instructed that Zhu be detained for seven days for further questioning.</p>

<h3>Reading Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>Divergence of Theories and Grasping the Correct Theory (Part 2)</p>
<p>The question raised by Hu Jie Jun is indeed very important and deserves our careful discussion. However, this question cannot be explained in a few simple words, so now we can only discuss it in a very superficial way.</p>
<p>Why do theories diverge? There are approximately two reasons for the divergence of theories: First, the vagueness of understanding. There is a famous example of this: the story of the blind men touching an elephant. Because the blind men cannot see, they must use touch to understand the elephant. However, in the end, none of them correctly understood the elephant. The man touching the foot said the elephant was like a large tree trunk. The man touching the nose said the elephant was a smooth stick. The man touching the elephant's body said the elephant was like a wall. Each of them was convinced that their understanding was correct because the "elephant" they felt and experienced was indeed so. Therefore, a great debate arose, causing a great uproar. To those who are not blind, this kind of dispute is quite laughable. However, from this kind of misunderstanding, we can see two points: First, the phenomena of the universe are complex, and examining only partial details will definitely fail to understand the entire phenomenon. Second, to understand phenomena, one must use the correct method. The blind men suffered because they could only use the method of touch, and the method of touch is not applicable.</p>
<p>Secondly, there are preconceptions and intentional misunderstandings. One reason why a thing often has two or more explanations is the difference in viewpoints. Everyone has their own standpoint for observing phenomena. In other words, the central idea is different. When a biologist sees a forest, the question that comes to mind is what is the name of this tree, what kind of plant does it belong to? When an artist sees it, the feeling in his heart is the beauty of nature, and it can be used as a specimen for painting. Therefore, what pessimists see is nothing but pessimism, while optimists see the opposite. This kind of fact is unavoidable, especially in social sciences, because of the different interests of everyone, everyone takes the point of view of interests as what is right and denies what is wrong. Also, because interests are absolutely opposite, conflicts and contradictions arise, hence what Mr. Hu calls "sometimes there are two completely different theories." That is, the so-called "rationalization" is also. A fox wants to eat grapes, but because he can't get them by any means, he says, "I don't want those grapes, because they are sour." Is this believable? In fact, it is because he can't reach them! We often find this situation in our daily life, which is the so-called "saying one thing and thinking another."</p>
<p>But why does this kind of untrue theory exist? This also has its origins. Because the phenomena and essence of the universe are inherently inconsistent, it can allow the existence of untrue theories. A stick placed in a glass of water appears to be broken, but we know that the stick does not change when it enters the water. We see the sun circling the earth every day, but in fact, it is the earth circling the sun. However, some people insist that the stick changes as soon as it enters the water, and the sun revolves around the earth. If we cannot use science to prove its absurdity, we can do nothing about it. Therefore, the merit of science lies in its ability to recognize the essence and not be confused by superficial phenomena. Its task is to explain the reasons for the inconsistency between essence and phenomena.  The source of the divergence of theories has been explained above. Now we will discuss how to grasp the correct theory. This is exactly the answer you are eager to get and we are very willing to put forward for public discussion. From the above example of "touching an elephant," we can know that the mistake of this group of blind men lies in not observing from the entire phenomenon and not grasping the correct observation method. Therefore, if we want to study knowledge, especially social science, we must use the correct method and, more importantly, we must examine it from the whole. This is the premise of learning, but there is limited space here, so we cannot discuss methodology in detail. Fortunately, we are now compiling "Introduction to Self-Study of Various Subjects," and you can seek answers from there.</p>
<p>However, distinguishing the right and wrong of theories is the same as identifying the authenticity of currency. So even if you have the sharpest instrument of identification, you cannot do it without experience. Learning is gradually accumulated. If you want to study it thoroughly, you must increase your knowledge. As the saying goes, "It is not afraid of not knowing the goods, but only afraid of comparing the goods." The more you know, the more you can compare their gains and losses. In short, the most important method of learning is "My way is consistent," as Confucius said. However, this is still too vague. Zhu Xi's later annotation is much more practical. He said, "Learning is like threading money with a rope. Having money but no rope is chaotic and without a clue. Having a rope but no money is empty and devoid of everything." So, considering your current reading situation, we believe it is best to abide by these two sentences: "Learning without thinking is futile; thinking without learning is perilous."</p>
<p>The above is somewhat broad. Since you like to study social science and the current society, here we can simply offer you some more specific suggestions. To identify the truth and falsehood of all theories, you can abide by the following three principles: First, start from the facts, not from concepts. Second, that the theory is exposing and clarifying the truth, not concealing the truth; Third, that the theory stands on the position of the majority, not just for the sake of the minority.</p>
<p>You seem to be very interested in Soviet studies, and you are quite blinded by the claims of both critics and admirers. Regarding this kind of research, we have compiled a research bibliography, but this bibliography is still feared to be not extensive enough. Since you have read many books, it would be our great pleasure if you could tell us some book titles for selection. Recently, it was heard that the Shen Bao Series has translated the twelve studies of the Soviet Union published by the British New Fabian Research Society, which will be published after February. This book is the result of actual investigation, not moral hearsay, and its position is impartial and quite fair. It is worth introducing to you; after you read it, you may be able to turn your former vague impressions into clarity.</p>

<h3>On Fate</h3>
<p>— Xi Zi</p>
<p>"Every drink and morsel, is predestined", "Life and death are fated, wealth and status are determined by heaven."</p>
<p>Having struggled for a lifetime, climbing upward frantically, in the end, one remains poor and lowly, ending one's days in poverty. Being gluttonous and lazy, drifting along, and when things don't go well, buying a lottery ticket, and actually winning the jackpot. Naturally, the triumphant are overjoyed to the point of dying and coming back to life, while the frustrated are angered to the point of coming back to life and dying. However, this is also of no importance, it is the will of heaven.</p>
<p>Therefore, we should understand that being slapped in the face is destined to be beaten, and cannot be considered the other party's malicious insult. So if you get slapped on the left cheek, you'd better offer your right cheek, to test your fate to see if you should get hit once, or twice. If your fate is to be hit twice, then when you've had your fill of disaster, blessings will come and all will be well. If you get hit once and dodge the second hit, then the injustice is not resolved, and if it's not repaid in this life, you'll surely incur a debt for the next life.</p>
<p>"Human determination can overcome heaven," is most unreasonable. Since everything is presided over by the unseen, what use is human determination? Sun Wukong being unable to escape the palm of the Buddha is a good example. If human determination could overcome heaven, then, with the advancement of medicine, would the rich and noble not fear being immortal? But in fact, the rich and noble can die from a common flu, while the poor and lowly, suffering from typhoid fever, can sweat it out and recover without taking medicine. Zhuge Shanren, knowing astronomy above and geography below, how could he not know that the Han dynasty was about to end, yet he insisted on supporting that Ah Dou who could not be supported. With Zhuge's intelligence, could he not know that it was the will of heaven, something that human power could not reverse? But we should understand that Zhuge did this in order to cater to the will of heaven, because the will of heaven wanted Zhuge to devote himself so wholeheartedly. This is just like knowing that the bloodline is about to end, and still having to marry a concubine to give it a try. Although on the surface it is said to be testing fate, on the other hand, it may not be that he is destined to have a concubine.</p>
<p>Understanding this, why should we study the Shaobing Song or calculate with our fingers when the great calamity will come, and why should we worry about the great war in 1936. Even if we are walking on the road and crushed to death by an eighteen-story building collapsing, there is no need to appeal to the King of Hell for injustice, it is also destined by fate to be so.</p>
<h3>One-Man Show</h3>
<p>— Yan Qiao</p>
<p>In the empty space of Xuanmiao Temple, there was a disheveled hermit, wearing a patchwork beggar's robe. This robe was actually a red robe from the stage, and the embroidered patterns on the front and back were still faintly visible. I wonder how many times he had performed in this play! The hermit put on a fake beard, painted his face with powder, and sang and acted in the open space. Even an amateur like me found it very pleasing to the ear and the eye. He actually made the tunes sound melodious and winding, and he had the demeanor of someone on stage. If he were to put on his robes and official hat and step onto the stage, and have a generation of "civilized" performers and stagehands bow to him several times, he might be able to surpass Tan Xinpei and Sun Juxian, and closely follow Wang Xiaonong and Ma Lianliang. But he shouted himself hoarse for most of the day, and couldn't earn enough for a night's meal, let alone enjoy himself. He also had an assistant, who played the erhu for him, and his skills were not bad either, good enough to be called a musician.</p>
<p>This stuff is called a one-man show. If you were to quote the classics, it would clearly be You Meng wearing Sun Shuao's clothes. You Meng only dressed up, he didn't perform. A one-man show is even better than him. I don't know how, but when it came to Shanghai, one-man shows didn't have to sing or act. Even if they did sing, they could sing in any dialect, and even if they did act, they could make faces and wink. But they were greatly welcomed and became popular for a while. Like Wang Xiaonong, it cost twenty dollars a day for him to have fun. Other expenses can be imagined. The one-man show is so popular in Shanghai, but in the Xuanmiao Temple in Suzhou, it's like this. No wonder so many people who have been dragged to Shanghai by trains and ships from the interior, increase one by one every day.</p>
<p>But thinking a hundred steps back, Wang Xiaonong's popularity is still posthumous. And almost nine out of ten people looking for food in Shanghai always say that they can barely make ends meet. Then the old actors who perform one-man shows in Xuanmiao Temple are contented and uninsulted.</p>
<p>I happened to talk about this with a friend. My friend said that he had been to the countryside the year before last and earned more than in Xuanmiao Temple. But later, he became too repetitive, and it got worse day by day. In the end, he returned in a sorry state. I said, "That's right, artists have a strange temper. When they have no money, they work very hard. When they have a little money, they become lazy. What's so special about one-man shows!"</p>
<h3>In the Hall of Yama</h3>
<p>— Xi Xi</p>
<p>Although it was the beginning of winter, the wind was blowing tightly on the streets at night, as if it was about to snow, and it felt particularly cold. I turned up my collar, wrapped my coat tightly, and whistled in my mouth, but my heart was still cold and lonely.</p>
<p>Turning a corner, the dazzling light of the neon lights jumped into my eyeballs, and I was back in the Hall of Yama!</p>
<p>It had been more than two weeks since I spent the whole night in this Hall of Yama, abandoning the expensive books without reading them, and abandoning meaningful work without doing it. My friends couldn't find me, and didn't know what tricks I was playing. Some said: "Even the pure one like him has changed! Hasn't he fallen?"</p>
<p>Yes! I was tainted by the torrent of the metropolis. Shanghai, this mysterious Shanghai, was originally a big dye vat. If you jump in, you will eventually change color. But I fundamentally would not curse Shanghai. Shanghai itself has no sin. Shanghai itself would not make me fall! Although I was like a child, I had a heart, a strong faith. Although I was in coldness and loneliness, I would not waver or regret.</p>
<p>Ah, the scene in this Hall of Yama!</p>
<p>The whole place was plunged into darkness, with only some red light coming from the Exit. Everyone was whistling, was it a joyful scene? Was it the cry of ghosts?</p>
<p>The musicians on the stage wearing tuxedos were just like the Yama in the Hall of Yama, and the dancers with permed hair were just like the disheveled prisoners; ah! This joyful Hall of Yama!</p>
<p>Dance! Take advantage of my joyful tonight, but the Fanhualin unexpectedly played Volga Boatman, I don't want to listen to it anymore, my heart became melancholy. Doomed White Russians! Do you remember the scene of being expelled?</p>
<p>In the long tail of this Fanhualin, I slipped out of the Hall of Yama with a melancholy face, and whistled again in my mouth. This trembling tiny sound rippled in the midnight of the metropolis.</p>
<h3>The Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twenty-One</p>
<p>By the Lamp, Bitterly Exhorting His Weak Daughter-in-Law</p>
<p>Below the Mountain, Strolling with a Cane, Observing the Heroes with a Cold Eye</p>
<p>But without inquiring about news, he could never be at ease, so while he was unable to make up his mind, he lingered even longer in front of the Yang's residence. This day, because there was not a single cloud in the sky, the bright sun hung in the azure blue sky. There was not a bit of wind in the air, and the temperature was very suitable. Old Zhao thought to himself that people were saying that the red leaves on the West Mountain were beautiful, and city people were even taking cars to admire them. So, he lived in Haidian, not far from the West Mountain, and his two legs that didn't cost any money were convenient to use. While his spirits were good, why not go and take a look? Thinking this, he found a jujube wood stick at home to use as a cane and walked to the gate. As soon as he went out, he saw a young man in a suit pacing back and forth in front of the gate, his face hesitant, as if he was waiting for something. He thought of the young girl inside the gate who was his daughter-in-law, and he put on a stern face and glared fiercely at Ji Zhi. Ji Zhi recognized him, and not wanting to ignore him, he took off his hat, bowed to him, and smiled, "Aren't you Grandpa Zhao from the Zhao family?" Seeing that he was polite, Old Zhao could no longer keep a stern face, so he nodded to him and said, "My surname is Zhao, but I haven't had the pleasure of knowing your name?" Ji Zhi smiled, "My surname is Gan, and I know your son, Company Commander Zhao. My family lives here." As he spoke, he pointed vaguely towards the gate of his house. Old Zhao oh-ed and smiled, "So you are Second Master Gan. I've heard my son say that you are an ambitious person, and people admire you very much!" Ji Zhi held his hat in his hand and bowed slightly again, smiling, "I owe Company Commander Zhao a great favor, and I always wanted to thank him, but he has set off again. I took leave to come back to Haidian to see my brother's illness, and I'll be leaving in a few days. I'd like to go in and pay my respects to the old master, but I'm afraid it would be a bit presumptuous." (287)</p>
<h3>The White-Clad Angel</h3>
<p>— Xu Yongbo</p>
<p>I often think: it's a miracle!</p>
<p>In order to pursue that miracle, I also often wander, hesitate, linger, and look forward to it around North Sichuan Road, Yokohama Bridge, as if I were an early-stage patient with a mental illness.</p>
<p>Are they sisters from a foreign country? Or compatriots from my own country?</p>
<p>To this day, I have not been able to decide whether they are sisters from a foreign country or compatriots from my own country. But, in short, they are lovely, a typical Eastern beauty. And they are also unique! White hat, white nurse's uniform, and white socks, white shoes. But sometimes, they also wear flesh-colored stockings and black leather shoes, which does not hinder the harmony of beauty, but only enhances the tone of beauty.</p>
<p>Speaking of appearance, their faces are rosy, white, and very healthy; speaking of posture, their steps are unified, firm, and exceptionally generous. Other things, hair, eyebrows, mouth, fingers, everything is beautiful, everything meets the conditions of beauty. But in the end, you can't tell if they are sisters from a foreign country? Or compatriots from my own country?!! For the time being, I call them the White-Clad Angels.</p>
<p>The White-Clad Angels can be said to be the "Guanyin" who saves people from suffering. Therefore, their mission is to protect patients. The White-Clad Angels can also be said to be the Cupid with wings of happiness, so they will go to the post office in pairs to deliver that decree of love. In the distant mountains and rivers, there are countless young men waiting for them to bestow the sweet source of life!</p>
<p>I often think: it's a miracle!</p>
<p>But for the sake of the miracle, I am confused.</p>
<p>Little Recipes</p>
<h3>Eating in Jiaxing</h3>
<p>— Jin Zi</p>
<p>Jiaxing, this place is too familiar. Nine out of ten Shanghainese have been there! The so-called scenic spots such as Nanhu, Mist and Rain Tower, and Falling Sail Pavilion are often talked about, and travel notes that include these small waterside villages can often be seen in newspapers, so there is no need to promote them again; even eating in Jiaxing has been known to ordinary people for a long time. First is Nanhu water chestnut, second is Su sugar, and in addition, some Fengjing Ding hoof and Hangjiangjing Dou Su sugar are brought back. But gentlemen, these are things exclusively for out-of-town guests to buy and sell to barbarians, and there is really nothing to take. If you want to ask what is really delicious in Jiaxing, let me tell you some.</p>
<p>Outside the North Gate of Jiaxing is a famous bustling market. Across the city river, there is a large bridge, and under the bridgehead, there is a not-so-large restaurant. Because it is near the river, there is fresh fish and shrimp to eat all year round. Although they keep the fish and shrimp in a small river fenced with bamboo, just like some restaurants in West Lake, and take them out at any time to meet the market; however, the water in Jiaxing is fundamentally better than the water in Hangzhou, so the fish and shrimp produced there have a natural umami taste, unlike the West Lake's braised fish that relies entirely on sugar and vinegar. If you don't believe me, just try it once and you will agree with me. Moreover, not only can the fish and shrimp in Hangzhou not compare to them, but Suzhou and Wuxi are also far behind. Especially the fish and shrimp in this restaurant at the bridgehead are even better. In addition to fish and shrimp, there are also fried chicken slices (which can also be made into soup), which are also rich and tender, and very different from other places.</p>
<p>The two kinds of things mentioned above are more aristocratic, and it is also very troublesome to go to eat them seriously. On the several bustling streets in Jiaxing City, there are also several restaurants that are smaller than the restaurant mentioned above, each with only one room. Among the things they sell, there are three extraordinary products that are worth trying. The first is tender chicken. Sold by the piece, its tenderness is only slightly inferior to Lao Tou Tofu. You don't need to chew it, it can be melted, and it is fragrant, sweet, and delicious, indescribable. The price is only one hundred or one hundred and fifty coins per piece. The second is lard vegetable rice. They are mostly cooked with meat broth, so it is not as fatty as the vegetable rice in Shanghai; and it is cooked neither too soft nor too hard. When it is served, there is a burst of strange fragrance that is so fragrant that it makes people drool. The third is chestnut braised pork. The meat is probably mostly lean meat from the legs, with a little fat, cooked extremely soft, and placed together with chestnuts, which is also a unique flavor. These three things can be said to be cheap and good, and are both completely authentic Jiaxing specialties and the most civilian food. People who go to Jiaxing, don't miss it!</p>
<h3>Songjiang Perch</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>The Songjiang perch, perhaps everyone knows it as soon as it is mentioned. The perch is most plump around the winter solstice. These days, perch fish have been put on the market again in Songjiang. Here, I will tell readers a few small things about perch: The so-called perch is a kind of fish, white in color with black spots on its back, a very large mouth, very fine scales, a large head, and very hard fins and thorns. Larger ones reach two feet in length. The so-called silver perch and jade flower perch in ancient times all refer to this kind. But the Songjiang perch mentioned here is another kind, unique to Songjiang, and not found elsewhere. It is only five or six inches long, and has been famous since the Wei and Jin Dynasties. The people of Songjiang call it four-gill perch.</p>
<p>There are three Xiu bridges in Songjiang, namely Xiuye Bridge, Xiunan Bridge, and Xitang Bridge. It is said that the perch produced under Xiuye Bridge are four-gill, and the rest are three-gill perch. As for the difference between three-gill and four-gill, non-experts cannot see it, and most of the ones sold in the market are three-gill perch. Because true four-gill perch are very rare, but according to general fishermen, recently four-gill perch have moved their home, no longer under Xiuye Bridge, but moved to Yangduan, three miles north of Xiuye Bridge. This kind of rumor is also believable and suspicious. In short, the so-called true four-gill perch is not easy to find.</p>
<p>Because there are many praises for four-gill perch in ancient people's poems and articles, four-gill perch in Songjiang is a rare commodity; in addition, the number of products is not large, so in winter, the people of Songjiang all regard four-gill perch as a good gift. However, some people take four-gill perch to Shanghai and send it to me. The people of Shanghai put the four-gill perch in water to maintain it, but they don't know that it will die in less than a moment. The dead perch has no taste at all.</p>

<h3>Gansu College Sends Representatives to Beijing to Raise Funds</h3>
<p>The Central Government Has Already Donated 20,000 Yuan</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 9th) Gansu College's original monthly operating expenses were 130,000 yuan, allocated by the Gansu Provincial Government, which was considered insufficient. In recent years, the provincial government has been in financial difficulty, so the college specially sent its Dean of Academic Affairs, Zhu Mingxin, to Beijing to raise funds to subsidize the college's medical training program and hospital. It is learned that the central government has already donated 20,000 yuan, and the Boxer Indemnity Fund Board has also agreed to provide some subsidies. In addition, requests for subsidies will be made to Chairman Jiang, former Chairman Zhang Xueliang of the Beiping Military Branch, and the National Economic Council's Health Division. On the 9th, Zhu went to the Ministry of Health to discuss subsidies with Director Liu Ruiheng, saying that the college recently hired German medical doctor Wang Jinhuai and hospital director Mr. Wang. They have already come to Beijing from Shanghai this morning and will go to Gansu in a few days. Liu Ruiheng also intends to give Wang the title of reorganizing Gansu's health affairs. The funds Zhu has raised will be used by Wang to purchase medical equipment, instruments, models, etc., to take to Gansu. Zhu will have to stay for more than a month.</p>
<h3>Li Mouxi</h3>
<p>Report on the Inspection of Education in Anhui and Jiangxi</p>
<p>The detailed report of Li Mouxi, a specialist from the Ministry of Education, on his inspection of education in Anhui and Jiangxi provinces is still being compiled. On the morning of the 8th, when the Ministry of Education held its weekly memorial service, the Ministry asked Li Mouxi to report on the general situation of education in Anhui and Jiangxi provinces first. Mr. Li gave a brief oral report on the common points of the two provinces. The key points are recorded below: (1) "Provincial Education Funding" Anhui Province's education funding is more than 2.6 million yuan, of which 1.2 million is subsidized by the Ministry of Finance, which is relatively reliable. The remaining 1.3 million is paid by the province, but it cannot be paid on time and is now received at 65% of the actual amount. Jiangxi Province's education funding is 2 million yuan (salt surtax), which can be received. (2) "Local Education Funding Situation" (The following are common situations in both provinces) The largest sources are school property rent and land tax surtax. However, because the county government's finance bureau manages the revenue and expenditure in a centralized manner, the education bureau cannot preside over it, so it is inevitable that funds are misappropriated. The school property should be reorganized (because it is public property, the rent is low, and the school land has not been surveyed, so it is inevitable to慷公家之慨) to increase income. (3) "Secondary Education Situation" Although education funding is insufficient, the education administration authorities are quite able to work hard. Their spirit of perseverance and endeavor is admirable. However, the scientific and library equipment of middle schools in Anhui Province are insufficient, resulting in fewer practical proofs for science teaching, and the teaching methods are mostly injection-style, with very few students using heuristic methods to be active. (4) Mass education and short-term compulsory education have few achievements due to the lack of middle and lower-level talents. (5) School administrators are too focused on regional boundaries, and localism is too deep. It seems that people from Chu are not used in Chu. To adapt to the trend, exchange and adjust. (6) The entrance examination situation is that students are working harder than before because of the exams. (7) Vocational education Due to insufficient equipment, the establishment of departments is biased towards new-style engineering, and there is a lack of teachers with practical experience. Therefore, graduates from Anhui Bengbu Seventh Vocational School, Wuhu Second Vocational School, and Jiangxi First Vocational School feel that there is no way out or become ordinary primary school teachers, and what they have learned is not used. The relief methods are to focus on improving the existing industries and the inherent industries of local products. At the same time, teachers should enrich their practical experience, and summer refresher courses can be used to hold refresher courses for various subjects so that primary and secondary school teachers have the opportunity to supplement their knowledge. (8) The abuses of scholarships Although normal school students in both provinces have the preferential treatment of free tuition and board, the service methods for normal school students have not been implemented in accordance with regulations, resulting in many normal school students enjoying rights without fulfilling their service obligations. They are admitted to schools above the specialist level as usual, and students from outside the province who are admitted to schools above the specialist level receive subsidies of 90 to more than 100 yuan per year, while students who are admitted to schools above the specialist level in this province do not receive this treatment, resulting in a small source of students for schools above the specialist level in this province. "(9) Inspection opinions," After Commissioner Li finished his report, he also said that in his opinion, each province should have sufficient time to prepare before implementing a project (such as ordering the promotion of mass education and compulsory education before ordering the preparation of talents and teachers, and then ordering the implementation), so as not to neglect the orders and pretend to be empty words and perfunctorily evade responsibility. More inspectors should be sent to guide the implementation. It is also appropriate for private middle schools to run ordinary middle schools, and it is not appropriate to run vocational schools at the same time, because the establishment of vocational schools is more demanding, so provincial schools should run more vocational and normal schools.</p>
<h3>Students Studying in Japan</h3>
<p>Admission Requires Introduction from the Supervision Office</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education has ordered the Supervision Office for Students Studying in Japan regarding the admission procedures for students studying in Japan. In the future, students studying in Japan must submit their study certificates to the office and ask for an introduction to the school. The student status and graduation qualifications of all students who are admitted without being introduced by the office will not be recognized.</p>
<h3>Secondary School Affairs Meeting</h3>
<p>All Teachers Should Attend</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Education Department believes that the scale of secondary school affairs meetings is relatively large. There are dozens of teachers in large schools. If they all attend, it is feared that there will be too many people and the discussion will be too long. It has submitted a request to the Ministry of Education to change the regulations for middle schools, normal schools, and vocational schools to stipulate the number of attendees at school affairs meetings. The Ministry of Education believes that the school affairs meeting is the most important meeting in the school, and it is still ordered that all teachers attend the meeting to gather ideas and benefit from each other.</p>

<h3>Dean of Tongji University in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Mr. Wosmer Died on the Way Back to His Country</p>
<p>(Guomin News Agency, 9th, Monoville Telegram) Dr. Wosmer, the dean of higher education at Shanghai Tongji University, recently asked for leave to return to his country. He died suddenly this evening not long after arriving here, at the age of 52. The doctor had been suffering from cancer for a long time, and the cause of death may have been due to this. According to reports, the doctor was a scholar who was well-versed in Chinese affairs and was highly regarded by Chinese and foreign人士. He is now the chairman of the Shanghai German East Asia Association. At the beginning of 1911, he went to China to serve as a teacher at the Qingdao Sino-German Higher School. During the European War, he came to Shanghai to teach at Tongji Commercial School and also served as the dean.</p>
<h3>President Jiang Menglin of Peking University Arrives in Beijing</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 9th) Jiang Menglin arrived in Beijing on the evening of the 8th and will report to the Ministry of Education on school affairs. According to reports, the turmoil at Peking University has subsided, students are studying with peace of mind, and professors are teaching with dedication. In terms of school affairs, efforts are being made to improve the equipment.</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Province</h3>
<p>Implementing Special Education in the Recovered Areas</p>
<p>(Nanchang Correspondence) The Jiangxi Education Department previously received orders from the provincial government to implement special education in the counties bordering bandit areas and recovered areas. It immediately drafted the Outline of the Special Education Plan for the Recovered Areas of Jiangxi Province and submitted it to the provincial government for revision and approval in October of last year. Among them, the original budget for the funding item was 180,000 yuan, of which 150,000 yuan was used to run 300 mass schools, distributed in the counties bordering bandit areas and recovered areas, with 12 schools in each county, 10,000 yuan was used to train 300 teachers, and 20,000 yuan was used to subsidize the literacy movement. The collection of these 180,000 yuan of funds was originally planned to request a subsidy of 120,000 yuan from the Xingying, 30,000 yuan from the provincial government, and 30,000 yuan from the provincial education fund. Although the case was approved, the request for a subsidy from the Xingying still needs to be submitted to Jiang for approval. The Education Department believes that this education is very important, and it has proposed to the provincial and county meetings that 30,000 yuan should be allocated from the provincial education fund. The scope of the original plan will be reduced, and a part of it will be handled first, that is, 26,500 yuan will be temporarily used to open 53 mass schools (500 yuan per school), distributed in Lianhua, Ninggang, Tonggu, Xiajiang, Dexing, Leping, Yongfeng, Wannian, Yiyang, Ruichang, Xingan and other counties, with 5 or 6 schools in each county. 3,500 yuan will be used to train 60 teachers, which has also been approved. Therefore, the Education Department has ordered the department to rush to plan and implement this special education in the shortest possible time, in order to realize it as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Anhui Province Secondary School Graduation Entrance Examination</h3>
<p>Dispatch Chen Mingxin and others as chief examiners for Si, He, and Tong counties</p>
<p>It is decided to hold them separately for three days starting on the 11th of this month</p>
<p>(Anqing Correspondence) Due to the fact that most secondary schools in the province have started autumn semesters in recent years, the number of graduating students in the second Anhui Province Secondary School Graduation Entrance Examination is smaller than that of the first Secondary School Graduation Entrance Examination. The members of the second Secondary School Graduation Entrance Examination Committee of the Education Department have decided to hold the exams in Sixian, Hexian, and Tongcheng on the 11th, 12th, and 13th of January. The scope of the examination is: (1) The entrance examination for graduating students from Sixian Junior High School, Hexian Junior High School, and Private Sanyu Junior High School; (2) The re-examination for students who failed one or two subjects in the senior high school entrance examination of the first Secondary School Graduation Entrance Examination will be held incidentally. As the examination period is approaching, the committee is actively preparing and has been holding meetings for several days to discuss all the details of the process, and has passed the examination hall rules, matters that invigilators should pay attention to, matters that chief examiners should pay attention to, and the examination subject timetable. The test questions for each subject have also been drafted and will be given directly, without using testing. The Education Department has appointed Supervisor Chen Mingxin as the chief examiner for Sixian County, Supervisor Wei Congxu as the chief examiner for Hexian County, and Supervisor Zhang Shaolie as the chief examiner for Tongcheng County. After being appointed, Chen and others are preparing everything and will set off separately in the next few days.</p>

<h3>City Education Association</h3>
<p>Conducting an Independent Education Funding Movement</p>
<p>A letter to the Education Associations of various districts, advocating unity</p>
<p>The amount of education funding should account for one-fourth of the city's total revenue</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai City Education Association launched the independent education funding movement in this city, it has spared no effort in its efforts. Yesterday, the association sent letters to the University Education Federation, the Secondary School Education Federation, and the Education Associations of various districts, requesting their united advocacy. The original letter is recorded below. Dear Sirs, To promote education, sufficient and reliable funding is essential. This city is the cultural center of the country, but its education funding is not yet independent, which is enough to affect the development of education. The association is deeply aware of this, so it was resolved at the 20th Board of Directors meeting to petition the municipal government to determine that the city's education funding should account for one-fourth of the city's total revenue, designate a certain reliable tax to offset it, and establish an education funding management office to take care of its affairs, etc. The minutes are on record. The matter concerns the independent education funding movement. In addition to submitting it to the party and government organs, we also correspondently request your association to unanimously advocate it in order to promote it. If you have any insightful opinions, please reply in detail.</p>
<h3>Director Lei of the Ministry of Education</h3>
<p>Came to Shanghai to Investigate the Jida Turmoil</p>
<p>Representatives of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee Will Return to Beijing Tonight to Report</p>
<p>Student Petition Team Visited School Boards Yesterday</p>
<p>The All-Campus Alumni Association of Jida Published its Stance</p>
<p>(Shanghai News Agency) The Ministry of Education, due to the long-standing turmoil at Jinan University, specially sent Director Lei Zhen of the General Affairs Department to Shanghai to investigate the truth in order to make a decision. Mr. Chen Chunpu, a representative of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee, has completed his investigation and is scheduled to return to Beijing tonight to report. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education Sent a Commissioner to Shanghai to Investigate After the turmoil broke out at Jida, the Ministry of Education recently received reports from the school authorities and the students. In order to clarify the truth and decide on a solution, Director Lei Zhen of the General Affairs Department was specially sent to Shanghai to investigate the truth. Mr. Lei has already arrived in Shanghai, but his whereabouts are extremely secret, and he will not make any statements during the investigation. As for Mr. Shen Pengfei, Director of Higher Education of the Ministry of Education, he did not have an investigation mission when he came to Shanghai last time. The Shanghai News Agency reporter has proved that he did not personally visit Jida. The rumors that Mr. Shen has indeed arrived in Shanghai to investigate and returned to Beijing to report are completely untrue. Bridge Association Representatives Will Return to Beijing Tonight Mr. Chen Chunfu, Director of the Education Department of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee, was dispatched to Shanghai to investigate the Jida turmoil. He visited the school in person a few days ago to inspect the actual situation. Yesterday, the Shanghai News Agency reporter visited Mr. Chen at his residence to inquire about his views after investigating the Jida turmoil. According to reports, after coming to Shanghai this time, he has investigated the school authorities and the students. The students are in good order at the school, but they are protesting the school's announcement to end the exams, and they have decided not to hold them until the principal's problem is resolved. Principal Zheng also reported on the turmoil, and said that he would resolutely not resign from his position as principal. He himself still needs to investigate the municipal authorities and other third parties in order to clarify the truth. Today, he visited Mayor Wu and Director Pan, but did not meet them. He is scheduled to make another investigation with the municipal authorities and related parties tomorrow (that is, today), and then take the night train back to Beijing to report. In addition, Mr. Chen believes that the Jida turmoil is an unfortunate event in overseas Chinese education. If the principal's problem is not resolved for a long time, and the students do not take the exams, the annual leave will be over in a flash, which will greatly waste the students' studies. Overseas Chinese compatriots cannot understand the situation, which will definitely cause a bad impression. Therefore, after he returns to the ministry to report, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee will decide on a solution and consult with the Ministry of Education to ensure that the turmoil is resolved as soon as possible and the students' studies are restored.</p>
<p>The Petition Team Visited the School Board Yesterday The school's student petition team, Zhou Zhaoxin, Fan Xifan, Peng Chengzhong, Chen Bin, etc., visited the school board members Sun Zhesheng, Wu Tiecheng, Ma Chaojun, etc., in two groups yesterday. The students said that the school order is very good at present, but if the turmoil is not resolved for a long time, it will cause indignation among the students, and the order may be difficult to maintain, etc. In addition to urging the students to strictly abide by the order, the school board members also promised to convene a meeting of the school board members in the coming days to ensure that the turmoil is resolved quickly.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Students Deny Representatives to Beijing The Overseas Chinese Students Federation previously sent representatives Lin Yanxi and Wu Yiping to Beijing to report to the higher authorities due to the tense turmoil in the school. However, after the representatives arrived in Beijing, they did not follow their mission, and their speeches violated public opinion. An emergency executive committee meeting was held at 10:00 am yesterday, with nine attendees including Ma Jun. Wu Lie chaired the meeting, and Chen Tingrui recorded the minutes. The following was immediately resolved: (1) Deny the speeches made by the two representatives Lin and Wu in Beijing; (2) Revoke the qualifications of the two representatives Lin and Wu. The Principal's Office Was Sealed Yesterday The school's principal, Zheng Hongnian, ordered the General Affairs Department to send someone to the school at 3:00 pm yesterday to seal off the principal's office, the secretary-general's office, and the registrar's office separately. The Shanghai Alumni Association Will Hold a Meeting Tomorrow Members of the Shanghai Jida Alumni Association, Ping Zuren, Qiu Hanping, etc., believe that the executive committee of the association has violated public opinion and arbitrarily proposed mediation proposals. They have automatically scheduled an emergency general meeting at 2:00 pm this Thursday at No. 66 Hankou Road.</p>

<h3>Japan Learns that the Philippines Knows</h3>
<p>Three-Nation Conference Canceled</p>
<p>Japanese Representative Cancels Trip to Philippines</p>
<p>(Dentsu, Tokyo, 9th) Regarding the participation of China, India, and Manchuria in the 10th Far Eastern Olympics, the host country, the Philippines, informed the above countries that a tripartite committee of China, Japan, and the Philippines would be held in Manila in February. Japan had originally planned to send Matsuzawa Ikkaku as a representative of the Sports Association to depart from Kobe on the 19th for the Philippines. Recently, the Philippines sent another telegram stating that China opposed the participation of Manchuria and refused to send a representative, so the committee could not be established. Therefore, Representative Matsuzawa also canceled his trip to the Philippines.</p>

<h3>Record of the 2nd Malaysian Chinese Games</h3>
<p>Chen Ya-jiu's 15.2 Seconds in Hurdles is Suspicious</p>
<p>Deng Yin-jiao's Women's Long Jump of 4.87 Meters is Excellent</p>
<p>Singapore Sweeps Men's and Women's Overall Championships</p>
<p>(Singapore, December 26th) The 2nd Malayan Overseas Chinese Games, after eight months of preparation, opened on December 23rd of last year at the Ampang Road sports field in Kuala Lumpur. The event lasted for four days, concluding on the 26th. Important figures of the National Government, such as Lin Sen, Chiang Kai-shek, and Wang Jingwei, all served as honorary chairmen. Participation was enthusiastic. The men's division included districts such as Singapore, Perak, Penang, Selangor, and Malacca, while the women's division included Singapore, Penang, Selangor, Perak, and Johor. The track and field results were outstanding. Chen Ya-jiu's time of 15.2 seconds in the high hurdles broke the Far Eastern Games record. If the timing is reliable, it is truly gratifying. Deng Yin-jiao's long jump of 4.87 meters rivals Shanghai's Qian Hangsu and Guangdong's Li Huanfen. The interest in ball games was excellent, especially in soccer. Left-handed tennis player Lin Wangsu also represented Singapore and won the championship. Singapore swept all the championships except for the all-around and track events, which were won by Selangor; the stick fighting (i.e., Huo Jin) was shared by Perak and Penang; and women's tennis, which was won by Selangor. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Soccer Championship</h3>
<p>In the semi-finals, Singapore heavily defeated Johor 5-0, and Penang eliminated Malacca 3-1. In the final, the Singapore team faced the Penang team, resulting in a 3-3 tie. The game was extended repeatedly for a total of 20 minutes, but both sides were evenly matched, and the game ended in a draw. Singapore player Xie Qingfu had participated in track and field events for several days, so his energy was depleted and he could not perform to his full potential. Additionally, Cai Wenli was serving as a finish line judge, so he was unavailable to play. Thus, the team's overall strength was reduced, but they were still fortunate to hold the spirited Penang team to a draw.</p>
<h3>Men's Basketball</h3>
<p>After the Singapore men's basketball team eliminated Johor and defeated Perak, their only opponent was Penang. Many believed that the Singapore team was so strong that they would surely win the final against Penang. Indeed, the Singapore athletes were full of energy and doubled their ferocity. Their teamwork was as solid as a fortress, and their attacks were seamless. Although the Penang team repeatedly vowed to counterattack and prepared for a desperate battle, fate had already decided the outcome, and they were ultimately defeated. In the end, Singapore won with a score of 61 to 27, amidst cheers from the crowd.</p>
<h3>Women's Basketball</h3>
<p>At 2:00 PM on the 26th, the Singapore women's basketball team faced Perak in the final to vie for the championship. The stands were packed with spectators who wanted to see who would win the championship. The players on both sides, each wanting to bring glory to their district, showed great spirit, darting left and right like swallows flitting through the eaves. The performance was very entertaining, but Perak was ultimately no match for Singapore. In the end, Singapore won the women's basketball championship with a score of 44 to 11.</p>
<h3>Men's Volleyball</h3>
<p>In men's volleyball, the Singapore team first defeated the Penang team 3-1, then won three straight sets against the Johor team. They faced the Perak team in the final to determine the ultimate winner. The two sides were evenly matched. The Singapore team's players were the best from the local Nan Lion team and other veteran volleyball players. However, the Perak team's players were also the best from various districts in Perak. Their strength was evident in their 3-2 victory over the historically strong Selangor team. However, the Singapore team's skills were superior, their spikes were accurate, and they knew their opponents' weaknesses. Their ability to block shots while jumping in the front row was also a key factor in their victory. Although the Perak team struggled and fought like cornered beasts, they won one set but ultimately had to concede the brilliant championship to the Singapore team. The result was 3-1, with the Singapore team returning in triumph. When the Perak team won a set, the audience cheered loudly to encourage them, and their excitement was difficult to describe in words. Fortunately, the Singapore team's players remained calm and continued to work hard, fully displaying their skills, and ultimately achieved the final victory.</p>
<h3>Women's Volleyball</h3>
<p>The Singapore and Selangor women's volleyball teams, who had qualified for the final, lined up on the field one quarter of an hour before the match. As the flags waved, the audience applauded thunderously. After the game started, both sides concentrated on achieving the final victory. However, the Singapore team's players were mostly veterans, and their teamwork was excellent. The front row players set the ball, and the middle row players spiked it. Sometimes, the front row players jumped up and pushed the ball down, and the ball entered the space, drawing applause and cheers. The Selangor team showed signs of faltering under this pressure. As a result, Singapore won in three straight sets. At the end of the final set, the Singapore team's players rushed forward to shake hands with the Selangor team's heroines as a gesture of respect and cheered three times before retiring.</p>
<h3>Men's and Women's Tennis</h3>
<p>In doubles, the Singapore and Perak teams qualified for the final. When the two teams competed, tennis enthusiasts crowded the Chinese Sports Association's tennis court. The Singapore team worked hard, and their teamwork was better than the Perak team's. As a result, Singapore won 2-1. In singles, everyone expected that Lin Wangsu, the left-handed oddity who had won the Malayan tennis championship for several years, would surely defeat the Perak representative. As expected, he won two straight sets, 6-0, 6-0. Mr. Lin triumphantly sang a victory song. In women's tennis, only Singapore, Penang, and Selangor participated. The Singapore team was eliminated in the preliminary round, and Selangor won the championship.</p>

<h3>West Youth Basketball Last Night</h3>
<p>Hujiang Wins Against St. John's</p>
<p>Jinan Wins Against Qingguang</p>
<p>In West Youth Basketball, two Group A matches were played last night. The results were: (1) Hujiang won against St. John's, 41 to 31, and (2) Jinan won against Qingguang, 38 to 27.</p>
<h3>Hujiang Wins Against St. John's Hujiang and St. John's first faced off. Although Hujiang won, the</h3>
<p>performance of both sides was far inferior to years ago. Thinking back to the past is evocative. On the court, Qian Jingyong and Feng Nianhua of Hujiang were very active. After a score of 4-3, they were on a roll and scored ten consecutive points, making it 17-6. At this time, Wu Youliang of St. John's was greatly inspired and scored consecutive shots, adding four goals in one go. Ma Fangcui scored once three times, and St. John's scored fourteen consecutive points, surpassing them 19-17. St. John's momentum grew. Feng Nianhua then urged a counterattack and regained five points near the end of the first half. In the first half, Hujiang won 22-19 by three points. Starting in the second half, St. John's was again dispirited, and Hujiang took advantage of the situation to move ahead, taking the lead by a difference of about ten points all the way. As a result, Hujiang won 41-31.</p>

<h3>Jinan Wins Against Qingguang In the battle between Jinan and Qingguang, Jinan</h3>
<p>controlled the overall situation, and Qingguang never lifted its head. When Jinan had twelve points, Qingguang only had two points. When it was 23-12, veteran Tan Dahua of Qingguang was brought in, but he still could not turn the situation around. At the end of the first half, Jinan had 24 and Qingguang had 13. In the second half, Qingguang was still dismal, and Jinan was always ahead by a dozen points. Although Yin Guiren of Jinan was penalized out five minutes before the end, it was no longer relevant to the outcome. As a result, Jinan won 38-27.</p>

<h3>Case of Assaulting the Referee</h3>
<p>Jiaotong University's Strong Stance</p>
<p>Requests the Jiangnan University Sports Association for Reconsideration</p>
<p>丨Sportsmanship Dies Young丨</p>
<p>(Shanghai News Agency) In the Jiangnan University soccer match between Jiaotong University and Jinan University, the referee, Shen Huichun, was injured in an assault. After several negotiations, there was no result. The Jiangnan University Sports Association recently held a meeting and decided to suspend Jiaotong University from participating in various Jiangnan University ball game competitions for one year, and demanded that the assailant apologize and acknowledge medical expenses, among other things. After receiving this notice, Jiaotong University sent a letter to the association the other day, stating the circumstances of the incident and requesting that they uphold justice and reconsider the matter to ensure fairness. The original letter is excerpted below.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Jiangnan University Sports Association</h3>
<p>Regarding your esteemed letter, we respectfully acknowledge the kind concerns. We have carefully considered the five resolutions mentioned, and we are deeply troubled. It is regrettable that this unfortunate incident occurred within our school's field. We feel deep guilt and remorse for the unwarranted disaster suffered by Referee Shen. As the host, we cannot shirk our due responsibility. The resolutions made by your association reflect a just attitude and fulfill your rightful duties, which we should abide by. Apart from our school's preparation of a formal letter of apology to the Referees Association and our willingness to bear Mr. Shen's medical expenses, we feel that the third resolution of your association is somewhat unfair in terms of both emotion and reason. Although silence would be safe, we are not arguing for the sake of argument.</p>
<h3>Five Solemn Statements Regarding the occurrence of this incident, our school cannot shirk its</h3>
<p>responsibility as the host. However, considering the cause of this incident, our school cannot be held entirely responsible. Even if this incident was unrelated to the ball grabbing, the order of the field would not have been disrupted had Jinan not grabbed the ball. If order had not been disrupted, how could it have been impossible to maintain it, leading to the occurrence of this unfortunate incident? This is the first solemn statement. Furthermore, according to Mr. Shen himself, the person who first committed the assault was indeed wearing a long blue cloth gown, which is not the uniform of our school's students. There is no doubt that the assault was committed by someone who was not a student. Perhaps this person had a prior grievance and took this opportunity to seek revenge, or perhaps a rioter infiltrated the ranks of the guests and intentionally caused harm. The facts are clear, and the evidence is conclusive. Although our school cannot escape its responsibility as the host, how can we bear the full blame? This is the second solemn statement. When the Jinan students grabbed the ball, the order in the field was already disrupted. After the assault on Mr. Shen by the person wearing the long blue cloth gown, the attention of thousands of spectators turned to Mr. Shen, and he was surrounded. The order became even more chaotic than before. Whether any of our school's students participated in the violence, our school authorities have no way of knowing. We are not shielding the assailant. This is the third solemn statement. Although our sports achievements have improved in recent years, our sportsmanship has not been cultivated. Such unfortunate incidents are heard from time to time. A similar incident occurred at Fudan University last year, and even though your association imposed penalties, there were no such severe measures. To suspend various competitions for one year and deprive us of our rights is excessive. To punish the same crime differently is unfair. This is the fourth solemn statement. Furthermore, your association has always taken promoting sports as its duty. At this nascent stage, instead of nurturing and cultivating us, why do you rush to destroy us? If the circumstances truly warrant it, we will bow our heads and have nothing to say, and there will be no dissent. However, since the culprit has not yet been found, to severely penalize us in order to suppress our burgeoning vitality will not only prevent them from pursuing their aspirations but also greatly undermine the purpose of your promotion. This is the fifth solemn statement.</p>
<h3>Request for a Meeting to Reconsider</h3>
<p>In conclusion, the occurrence of this incident at our school's field is our school's misfortune. Mr. Shen's injuries are even more unfortunate for Mr. Shen. But the fact that the sports community experienced this unfortunate incident is especially a great misfortune for the sports community. Our school's responsibility is undeniable, and we should express our utmost sincerity in apologizing. We only hope that your association will uphold justice, convene a meeting to reconsider, and approve the amendment of the third resolution in order to ensure fairness. We sincerely ask for your public friendship. With heartfelt prayers, we remain, Jiaotong University Sports Committee. (Shanghai News Agency)</p>
<h3>City Workers' Sports Meet Preparatory Committee Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Labor Union, in order to promote public sports and improve workers' health, has decided to hold the first Shanghai Municipal Workers' Sports Meet this spring. The union has specially formed a sports committee and has invited Ling Xitao, Wang Zhuangfei, Zhou Jiaqi, Xu Duo, and others to actively guide the process, which is progressing smoothly. After the announcement of this news, several labor unions have registered to participate every day. Those with existing sports organizations are currently supervising training, while those without sports organizations are actively forming them. It is expected that the competition will showcase a unique aspect of workers' sports. It is reported that the union has scheduled the third preparatory committee meeting for 3:00 PM on the 11th of this month (Thursday) at the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union conference room on the third floor of 230 Laobazi Road. Liu Xinquan, Liu Zupei, Fan Yifeng, Ling Jiyun, and Li Mengnan are requested to attend on time. Ling Xitao, Wang Zhuangfei, Zhou Jiaqi, Xu Duo, and others have also been invited to attend and provide guidance to facilitate the progress.</p>

<h3>Abandoning the Hometown</h3>
<p>— Xu Maoyong</p>
<p>Mr. Luo Wu pointed out in the *Shen Bao Monthly* that Chinese people's attachment to their hometowns is a characteristic of agricultural peoples. The foundation of agriculture is the land, a fixed place. Therefore, agricultural peoples generally love their native land. Leaving their native land, they lose their foundation of life. Thus, Wang Can said: "Human sentiment is the same in cherishing the land, who, whether successful or unsuccessful, would have a different heart?" Ban Chao, having achieved meritorious service in the Western Regions, longed to return home in his old age, even saying in a memorial to the Han Emperor: "Your subject does not dare hope to reach Jiuquan County, but only wishes to enter the Jade Gate Pass alive." This is the so-called "the fox dies facing its mound, the Daì horse leans on the wind," showing the depth of attachment to one's homeland.</p>
<p>"Home is where we are born, and where we die." This is precisely where the great love of the children of the land lies.</p>
<p>However, the situation has greatly changed now.</p>
<p>Now, there is a class of people who are unwilling to return to their hometowns. They live in cities in other provinces, or in cities abroad. They are the wealthy. The wealthy of the past were happy to return home, thinking that "wealth and honor without returning to one's hometown is like walking in brocade at night." However, the matter of returning home in brocade has no meaning for them, because the foundation of their lives is no longer in the rural land, but in urban industry and commerce. They do not need to continue to gain the respect of their fellow villagers, because the villagers are no longer the direct object of their exploitation. At the same time, the countryside cannot provide them with the life they need. Therefore, they spend their lives in foreign lands or countries.</p>
<p>Another class of people is unable to return to their hometowns. They come from their hometowns and wander everywhere. The reason they left their hometowns is that they lost their foundation of life in their hometowns. Their original land was taken away, or they only had land but no ability to cultivate it. Their birthplaces were unable to support them, so they had to run away. But outside, it is also difficult to find a new foundation for life. Thus, they become "displaced and homeless." Soon after, they fill the roads and ditches of foreign lands.</p>
<p>From the increase in these two classes of people, we can see that Chinese society is constantly changing. The Chinese people originally wanted to be content with the status quo and did not want to change, but society has changed, and your life has to change, either making you voluntarily break away from the status quo, or forcing you to be unable to be content with it.</p>
<p>From this arises another situation. On the one hand, there are people in the cities hiding in attics and shouting "Go to the countryside." On the other hand, groups of people are rushing from the countryside to the cities. Thus, the countryside collapses and the cities panic.</p>
<h3>More on Realistic Novels and the First-Person Point of View</h3>
<p>— Mu Mutian</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Chen Junye's "On First-Person Point of View and Realistic Novels," I am very happy. It is not without benefit that this issue can be discussed.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Chen's argument seems to differ from mine. This is what I want to state first.</p>
<p>The starting point of my question is that in China today, it is very difficult to use the first person to write about workers and farmers in a way that makes the writing match the identity of the protagonist, thus reducing the authenticity of the work. The problem has limits. It is about present-day China. It is about writing about the lives of workers and peasants. Starting from this point, I feel that realistic literature must have its realistic style. At present, the question of style needs to be discussed.</p>
<p>Secondly, I want to state that Mr. Chen has elaborated on my opinion to the point of mystery. Mr. Chen has added to me things that I have not said and things that I have not thought about. I have not said: "The first person is absolutely not applicable to modern realistic novels," nor have I denied that "in appropriate situations, the first-person point of view can be used." (The words in these quotation marks are quoted from Mr. Chen's original text.) However, I have always affirmed: no matter how well the subject matter is handled, it will always be restricted by objective reality, and will reduce the artistic authenticity of the work. Because it is not enough to complete the task of "expression of society". That is why Flaubert abandoned George Sand's method. This is the general saying. And in the current culturally backward China, writing about the lives of workers and peasants using the first-person point of view is more likely to lead to the ridiculous.</p>
<p>Having clarified the above, I will now make a reply to Mr. Chen's different opinions.</p>
<p>First, the first-person point of view is a form commonly used by romantic writers. Naturally, what determines this form is the content of the writer's work. Why do those people want to use the first person? We cannot but attribute this to their individualism and lyricism. The demand for individual liberation since the Renaissance has created the foundation of this lyricism. This self-affirming individualism and lyricism naturally requires the first-person point of view. Since Rousseau, it has become the dominant style in literature. They demand personal expression, so they often bring out "I" (lernoi). However, in the era of transition from "self-expression" to "social expression," this lyrical style will naturally be abandoned. Because new wine cannot be put in old wineskins, realistic writers used new styles. Regarding this debate, the correspondence between George Sand and Flaubert is a great reference. Naturally, that form is old. A literary style has its temporality and spatiality, and has its dominant era and territory. For example, in seventeenth-century France, in court society, in salons, there were forms such as "letters" and "maxims". In civil society, there was the form of "novel", while the tragedies of Racine and Corneille, and the comedies of Molière, are also products of different (not "absolute"!) environments. Similarly, "dedicatory poems" also have their temporality and spatiality. The newness or oldness of a form is based on the era as the standard. Old-style poetry is an old form because it is a product of the old era. It is not impossible to express new content using old-style poetry. However, one cannot say that it is a new form just because it has new content. For example, songs during the French Revolution, such as "La Marseillaise" and "Carmagnole", are naturally old forms, although they have new content. Similarly, Béranger used the form of "fable poems" to create many popular songs, but can you say that "fable poems" are a new form? I believe that a new form should refer to a form that is produced in the present (such as mass choral poetry). Naturally, old forms that have life can still be used. Secondly, I think Mr. Chen has contradicted himself. He acknowledged my fundamental argument: "The first-person point of view is not suitable for expressing complex reality", but at the same time he said: "But this does not prevent the first-person point of view from also being used as a realistic method; the authenticity of a work should be attributed to the degree of the author's understanding of reality and the means of expression, and has nothing to do with the first-person method." The authenticity of literature is directly proportional to the amount of complex reality reflected in it. Naturally, the so-called reality must be passed through the author's understanding of reality. And the means of expression cannot be said to have nothing to do with the first-person point of view. If the author expresses a small amount of reality in a way that "misses one out of ten", thinking that it is "enough", then it cannot be said that there is no authenticity, but that kind of authenticity is not sufficient. That is naturally not a top-notch realistic work. Generally speaking, it is not easy to express the characters of the uneducated working class and peasantry as they are in reality when using the first person, no matter how correct the author's understanding is. Among the working class and peasantry in China today, probably no one can eloquently describe that confession. Mr. Chen cited Gorky as an example. However, none of Gorky's masterpieces, such as "Mother", "The Spy", and "A Coward", use the first person. Mr. Chen probably only paid attention to his memoirs, such as "First Love" and "My Childhood". Those memoirs cannot be regarded as purely realistic novels. Judging from works such as "First Love", Gorky is not a purely realistic writer. We must know that he is also a romantic writer. Method cannot be separated from understanding. Mr. Chen's separate view is a mistake. It is possible to use confession or diaries when writing about intellectuals, such as "Hunger" (Semyonov), but it cannot become a great realistic work. In China today, it is not possible to write about workers and peasants with confessions and diaries. Do not forget that the first person is a form of individualistic lyricism, and what present-day realism needs to write about is the emotions of the working class and peasantry in the national liberation struggle.</p>
<h3>New Year in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Zhou Lengjia</p>
<p>The Earth quickly circled the sun for a week, and it is another New Year.</p>
<p>New Year, New Year. What year is this? This is the Year of the Child, the Year of Women's National Goods, 1934, hiding in the eve of a great era.</p>
<p>Without the complicated clamor, the New Year gongs and drums have lost their sound. Replacing them and taking the limelight is the wireless radio invented by Marconi, who just came to Shanghai. The sound waves of the broadcast fill the entire space of Shanghai.</p>
<p>*Three Smiles* *Marriage*, *Tears and Laughter Marriage*, Gilded Phoenix, Falling Golden Fan... one after another, constantly revolving around people's eardrums. Foreigners invent, Chinese enjoy, this is a matter of course, what's so rare?</p>
<p>On the road, the pulse of the city is beating; the tide of people, the tide of cars, are crowding forward.</p>
<p>On the seven-zhang high pole of the great world stands a strange man. Many people stand opposite, standing on tiptoes to look at him. "This person is so strange! It really broke the highest record of climbing into the sky, from 1933 to 1934." A line of smiling light flashed across the faces of two young people. The shop windows are covered with colorful posters, and the big discount flags are flying in mid-air! Happiness crepe triangle one foot, beaverteen one yuan one zhang. The depression is pitiful! But there are also the Paramount Ballroom and the Great Shanghai Theater:</p>
<p>Towering buildings, beautiful decorations, constantly emitting bright flames, dazzling people's eyes.</p>
<p>On the other side, industry is declining, and silk factories are closing down. All of this profoundly shows the abnormal development of the city. The Xinguang Theater is showing "Salt Tide". This tide engulfs all the pleasure-seeking audiences. Everyone who comes out of the theater has a serious face, and there is a salty and sour taste in their mouth.</p>
<p>Nanjing Road is like opening a fashion exhibition. Pairs of modern ladies walk down the road: red rouge, white powder, the joy of youth jumping on their faces. It's just that no one has any traces of national goods on their bodies. Alas! This "Year of Women's National Goods"!</p>
<p>A ragged beggar stands at the intersection, swallowing handfuls of leftover rice from a broken tin can into his mouth with dirty hands.</p>
<p>In the stock exchange, a shocking commotion is unfolding. The market is full of dense crowds of people, and smoke and carbonic acid gas permeate the space.</p>
<p>"Number 21 sell... Number 11 buy... Customs duties... Disarmament... Reorganization..."</p>
<p>The winners are laughing. The losers, with red eyes, secretly cried out "It's over" in their hearts, leaving this market without any nostalgia.</p>
<p>"Madam, master, young master, boss, cultivate happiness and longevity, give some money!" A woman with a sallow face drags a group of tattered children behind people, making a life-and-death wail. The pain of hunger and cold tightly grips their faces; there is no New Year among this group of people.</p>
<h3>Blind Girl in the Cold Night</h3>
<p>— Lu Wu</p>
<p>A faint light,</p>
<p>Shines palely on the road,</p>
<p>Making the cold night seem even more desolate.</p>
<p>Three or five idle people strolling at night</p>
<p>Closely follow a blind girl,</p>
<p>As if sympathizing, as if teasing.</p>
<p>The blind girl staggers along,</p>
<p>Weakly plucking the strings,</p>
<p>Singing of her own destiny.</p>
<p>But having walked the length of the street,</p>
<p>She does not meet a single appreciative listener; her hands are stiff, and her throat is hoarse.</p>
<p>The idle people gradually disperse,</p>
<p>Only the wind is still blowing wildly;</p>
<p>Blowing away that mournful melody.</p>
<h3>Two Brothers (8) (1)</h3>
<p>— Guy de Maupassant, translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>"You have already sought Mr. Roland's consent, haven't you?"</p>
<p>A similar blush suddenly covered the cheeks of both mother and son. The mother replied:</p>
<p>"Ah! No, that's not necessary!"</p>
<p>Then she hesitated, feeling it necessary to explain. She continued: "We don't consult with him in advance for anything we do. We only need to tell him what we have decided."</p>
<p>Mrs. Lu was not at all surprised to hear this, and smiled slightly, thinking it was very natural, because that good man didn't care about anything.</p>
<p>When Mother Roland and her son came out of Mrs. Lu's house and walked onto the guard, she said to her son:</p>
<p>"Let's go to your house for a while, I really want to rest."</p>
<p>She was afraid of her own home, feeling that there was no hiding place, no refuge.</p>
<p>They went to Zhe'an's house.</p>
<p>When she felt that the door was closed behind her, she let out a heavy sigh, as if the lock on the door had placed her in a safe realm; then, instead of resting as she had just said, she began to open the cabinets, examining the piles of clean clothes, the number of towels and socks. She changed the order in order to arrange and compare them more harmoniously, which could make her housekeeper's eyes look more pleasing; when she had arranged those things according to her own wishes, putting the towels, short crosses, and shirts on special shelves, dividing all the clean clothes into three major categories: things for the body, things for the house, and things for the dining table. She stepped back a little to admire her results, and said:</p>
<p>"Zhe'an, come and see how beautiful this is."</p>
<p>He stood up and praised her repeatedly to please her.</p>
<p>Then, when he sat down again, she suddenly approached his chair quietly from behind. With her right arm around the back of his neck, she kissed him while placing a small object wrapped in white paper on the mantelpiece with her other hand.</p>
<p>He asked:</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>Seeing that she did not answer, he understood, and he recognized the shape of the picture frame:</p>
<p>"Give it to me!" he said.</p>
<p>But she pretended not to hear, and turned back to the cabinets. He stood up, hurriedly took this painful relic, crossed the house, and ran to lock her in the drawer of his desk. Then she wiped a tear from the corner of her eye with her fingertip, and then said in a slightly trembling voice:</p>
<p>"Now I'm going to see if your new maid has put your kitchen in order. Because while she's out, I can check everything and have a count in my mind."</p>
<p>Nine</p>
<p>Letters of recommendation written by Professors Maslosser, Le Mieux, Flash, and Poliger, greatly praising their student Dr. Pierre Roland, obtained the assistance of Mr. Punam, judge of the Commercial Court, Mr. Le Yang, the great shipowner, and Mr. Marihua, the deputy mayor of Havre, a good friend of Captain Bo Qiru, and were submitted by Mr. Mashang to the board of directors of the Atlantic Mail Shipping Company.</p>
<p>It so happened that the doctor of the "Lorraine" mail ship had not yet been assigned, so Pierre was appointed within a few days.</p>

<p>Gold Market Hovers Around 90 Yuan</p>
<p>Resulting in a Further Increase of Six and a Half Yuan</p>

The US official gold purchase price remained unchanged. US cotton rose by 12 pounds, US wheat fell by 25, and stocks saw both gains and losses. The wool market opened and immediately soared to over 90 yuan, but some selling occurred due to taking advantage of the high price, so it retreated to within 90 yuan. Although sentiment was good after the opening, it was still flat due to bank selling. Later, due to preliminary reports that the US exchange rate was quoted to narrow by 0.375, it rose to 91.5 yuan. However, the exchange market remained as it was, without tightening. The gold price also fell, struggling around 90 yuan after entering the market. The situation was calm. The afternoon market was extremely quiet. Sentiment was still good, and large investors' buying interest was also strong, so there was a small increase at one point. Although the English-language *Great American Evening News* carried a report that the US would buy cash in Russia, which Russia would use to repay the price of goods borrowed from the US, there was no noticeable impact in the market. The red copper price was 1,055 yuan. The day's market conditions are recorded below:</p>

Sumitomo sold March at 625. Yuan Mao bought low to stabilize. McCurry bought May US dollars at 1875, Yuan Mao Yong, Yuan Heng, Heng Yu Li bought.

<p>The afternoon market opened at 689 yuan and 2 jiao, and goods opened at 9 yuan and 3 jiao. The market was extremely sluggish at the beginning. It was not until Hengxing Zhifeng Yong started to make small advances that it gradually recovered, rising from 9 yuan to 90 yuan, with a very slight movement at the top. Later, due to traffic selling March US dollars at 625, Zhengchang Shengda provided high-priced tickets, and it retreated to 89 yuan and 2 jiao. But Yuan Mao Yong Chunyuan Yong still came to buy, and Zhengjin bought May US dollars at 1875, the situation was still stable, and sentiment was also good. Yuan Mao Yongheng Yu continued to buy tickets, McCurry Datong bought January US dollars at 1875, and April at 875, and then rose to 91 yuan and 2 jiao. Zhifeng Yong Shun Mao sold off, struggling for a long time. The closing price was 690 yuan and 3 jiao, and goods were auctioned at 9 yuan and 5 jiao. Although Heng Yu entered the market after the close, it still fell slightly. It was found that the highest price of the day was 691.5 yuan, and the lowest price was 688 yuan and 8 jiao, with a difference of only 2 yuan and 7 jiao. As a result, it rose by another 6.5 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The posted price was 33.5 yuan because HSBC Bank's US exchange rate quotation narrowed by 0.375. The combined standard gold price was over 716 yuan. According to the closing price, it was about 26 yuan lower, which was more than 1 yuan higher than the previous close.

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Public Bond Trends Diverged</p>
<p>Although there were many buyers, there were also many short sellers.</p>
<p>Bonds from the 18th and 19th years performed well.</p>
<p>Bonds from the 20th year declined instead.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was slightly fluctuating, but the overall trend remained strong. There were still more buyers than sellers, and market sentiment was stable. The victories in the Fujian-Zhejiang war contributed to this stability. However, the financial situation remained insufficient, and the public bond market had already risen significantly. As a result, the number of sellers gradually increased, and some bulls began to exit the market. Short covering activity was not uncommon. In the short term, the market was likely to continue to rise. The upcoming Fourth Plenary Session was of great importance, and therefore, the future situation and the rise and fall of public bond prices were closely related, requiring careful consideration. During the opening of the market yesterday morning, there was scattered demand, which was quite enthusiastic. Issues 21 and 23 were still being sold, and prices initially continued to rise by 3 to 5 jiao. However, as sales of salt tax bonds surged, prices dropped back by 2 to 3 jiao. The secondary market weakened as a result, with strong selling pressure. Troop reduction bonds fell by 7 to 8 jiao, and other bonds fell by 4 to 5 jiao. Subsequently, after the sale of unified tax bonds, prices rebounded by 2 to 4 jiao, fluctuating up and down, creating a sense of uncertainty. In the afternoon, due to the late hour, only one session was held, and the trend followed the rebound at the close of the morning session. There were some buyers, and the prices of various bonds rebounded by 3 to 4 jiao. However, unified salt tax bonds failed to follow the overall trend and remained stagnant, showing signs of confusion. The future depended on whether Fuzhou could be captured in the short term. Once it was recovered, the upward trend would likely be considerable. If the situation dragged on for too long, it would approach the delivery date, and the upward trend would be even more intense. In the end, most of the bonds from the 18th and 19th years rose by 1 to 2 jiao or 4 to 5 jiao, while bonds from the 20th year fell by 1 to 2 jiao or 4 to 5 jiao. The trends before and after were divergent, indicating that short sellers were still very active. The total transaction volume was 23,740,000 yuan. There were no spot transactions. Futures trading volume for unified salt tax bonds was 8,500,000, troop reduction bonds 4,300,000, 19th year customs duties 2,020,000, 20th year secured bonds 4,300,000, and Jin short positive six bonds 2,950,000. The remaining amounts ranged from tens of thousands to two to three hundred thousand.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Mixed</h3>
<p>A report from the Sin Fung Foreign Firm on the 8th stated that the New York stock market was mixed and sluggish. Good business news and forecasts that steel production would reach 60% capacity by the end of the quarter were offset by a report from AT&amp;T that operating income for November increased, and US Treasury bonds continued to fall. Total daily trading volume was 720,000 shares. "Wheat" trading was quiet. Rainfall had no impact. Market conditions may decline, and "Cotton" should be bought. Bull positions were liquidated during the rise, and commercial receipts were gradually strengthening. The possibility of reduced production of coarse yarn is becoming a factor in determining market conditions. The Financial Rehabilitation Administration bought gold at a price of 34.06 yuan per tael, unchanged. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Remain Active</p>
<p>The yarn market continues to rise, and the trend remains strong. As the price of cotton is still uncertain and customer sales continue, market sentiment is stable. Purchases from inland merchants are relatively strong, and procurement from the South is also considered good. However, the price increase of standard yarn is not as significant as that of cotton. There is still a shortage of new buyers, and some are predicting that it will exceed 180 yuan for distant deliveries outside the customs.</p>
<h3>Distant Month Yarn is Good Outside the Customs</h3>
<p>At the opening of the Renbiao (human standard) market, due to the increase in American cotton prices, there were still many buyers, and short sellers covered their positions.</p>
<p>7,500 bales: Sold: Jifeng 800 bales, Yuanda 1,500 bales, Mingde 800 bales, Changfeng 550 bales, Xiesheng 600 bales, Shenji 1,100 bales, Chunji 400 bales, Dachang 350 bales. Bought: Tongji 1,000 bales, Dafeng 400 bales, Yuda 550 bales, Dafu 800 bales, Tongfu 400 bales, Yuande 700 bales, Renfeng 500 bales, Yiyu 500 bales, Xiesheng 550 bales. Closing prices are as follows:</p>

<h3>Yarn Sales Weak at 2,000 Bales</h3>
<p>Spot yarn sales remained active. Statistics show that all firms bought a total of 1,958 bales throughout the day. Prices increased by 5 jiao to 1 yuan. Purchase amounts by firm were as follows: Luzhou 75, Guangdong 405, Shantou 245, Ningbo 10, Nanyang 15, Inland 833, Changsha 160, Nanjing 5, Wuhu 10, Sichuan 100.</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Fuels the Rise in Cotton Prices</h3>
<p>The rise in cotton prices continues, driven by rising American cotton prices and a shrinking exchange rate. Even though Indian cotton prices have fallen, market sentiment remains difficult to contain, mainly due to the large number of short sellers. Buyers have comprehensive plans, and with the assistance of foreign cotton, the upward trend is intensifying. However, the yarn market remains stable, and major bulls are exiting. The future depends on the fluctuations in the Indian and American cotton markets.</p>
<h3>Zheng Biao (Zheng Standard) Rose Sharply by 3 Jiao</h3>
<p>At the opening of the Zhengbiao market, while American cotton prices rose, Indian cotton prices fell. At the close of the three sessions, prices suddenly surged by 2, 3, and 4 jiao. In the afternoon, prices rose nearly 1 jiao and fell 1 to 2 jiao in the distance. Total transaction volume for the day was 145,100 dan. Sold: Yuanda 6,600 dan, Jifeng 2,900 dan, Tongfu 2,400 dan, Gengfeng 3,500 dan, Hengde 3,000 dan, Changfeng 2,500 dan, Changhe 4,000 dan, Chunji 3,400 dan, Xinheng 2,300 dan.

<h3>American Cotton Rose Again by More Than Ten Pounds</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton prices rose because of active buying, good cloth sales, and manufacturers buying distant futures. Market conditions were firm and active, resulting in a rise of 10 points for spot prices and 11 to 14 points for futures. Liverpool cotton spot prices rose 9 points, and futures rose 11 to 12 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose 14 points. The Bombay cotton market initially fell due to bull liquidation, but later strengthened due to short covering. In the end, Pingar fell 1.25 rupees, Oomra fell 0.25 rupees, and Broach fell 0.75 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated the 8th):</p>
<p>American Cotton Compared to Previous Day Equivalent in National Currency British Cotton Compared to Previous Day Equivalent in National Currency 1 1065 Up 12 42.40 1 551 Up 11 46.30 3 1072 13 42.70 21 550 11 46.20 5 1088 11 43.30 5 549 12 46.10 7 1103 14 43.90 7 549 12 46.10 10 1120 11 44.60 10 551 12 46.30 12 1136 12 45.20 Spot 575 9 48.30 Spot 108 10 43.20 Egyptian 852 14 71.60 Pingar 140.25 Down 1.25 27.10 Oomra 175.75 0.25 34.00 Broach 194.25 0.75 37.60</p>
<h3>Grains: Flour Prices Steadily Decline</h3>
<p>The February Price Once Reached One Jiao Above Customs</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the prices of all months showed a uniform decline. The price of foreign wheat fell by another one jiao, and reports indicated that the government would continue to import wheat in large quantities, and the wheat that had already arrived had not yet been completely unloaded. As a result, factories were expected to have an oversupply of raw materials, while sales from various routes were minimal. The market situation became unstable. Furthermore, factories also took the opportunity to sell, so prices softened immediately after the opening and continued to decline. By the opening of the afternoon market, the prices of all months continued to be soft. The price for the current month even fell to 0.105 yuan, and the price for February once reached one jiao above customs. However, as short sellers slightly covered their positions, the market rebounded slightly. However, business from customer firms was very slow, and external firms were also less interested, making it difficult to see a recovery. In the end, the price for the current month fell by 0.0275 yuan compared to the previous day, February fell by 0.025 yuan, March and April fell by 0.0225 yuan, May fell by 0.02 yuan, and June fell by 0.0175 yuan.</p>
<h3>Nearsighted Wheat Hearts Soften</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning and afternoon, the prices for all months were flat and lacked momentum. The price of foreign wheat continued to fall by about 0.1 yuan. Most people in the market felt that as the current month was approaching the end of the lunar year, customers were making fewer transactions. Furthermore, as foreign wheat was imported continuously, the demand from factories was naturally very weak. Therefore, the mindset of people in the short term became greatly relaxed. Looking at the situation ahead, there was little optimism. In the end, the price for the current month fell by 0.06 yuan compared to the previous day, February and March fell by 0.03 yuan, April and May did not open, and June fell by 0.05 yuan. There was little arrival and storage of spot wheat. There were no transactions for unified market wheat in single bags. It was also reported that the government's borrowed wheat sold to factories was being resold in small quantities, causing prices to fall to 3.92 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hexia Rice Falls Again</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 40 firms (over 6,000 shi) from various sources. Wholesale transactions remained sluggish. The initial market opened weak and did not improve by midday. Only upstream firms were buying. Changbang purchased 300 bags of Japonica rice, and Southern and Northern ocean firms slightly purchased over 1,000 bags of Qinghe Liantang late rice. City and rural shops only made slight additions, so market conditions were difficult to stabilize and all prices fell. The prices of Japonica rice from Changbang, Su-gangbang, and Nangang fell by 8 to 1 jiao. The prices of Qing-jiao, Song-si, and West Lian late rice fell by nearly 1 chi. However, Due-yang long-grain rice was able to hold steady due to a shortage of goods. Households who made Yuang-wine were more willing to buy, making the market uniquely tight.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) There were 58 to 59 boats arriving from various sources. Sales of various types of rice in the market were average. White Japonica, Yang-Du glutinous, and Fu-xian declined by several points. Early Bo rice, Yin-bian Yuang-ke, and Xian were stable.</p>
<h3>Customer-Sourced Xian Rice Falls in Price and Sales</h3>
<p>| Min Yue Ningbo and Local Firms All Buying |</p>
<p>Yesterday's customer-sourced Xian rice market saw prices reach a bottom after consecutive days of price declines. Sellers were unwilling to sell at further reduced prices. However, this was because the price was small and easily resold. Yesterday, a Fuzhou firm that was opening ships to Min came to the market to purchase. Yue and Yong firms all believed that the prices were low and reasonable and purchased them unanimously. Local firms also continued to buy. However, the market became active as firms from various routes purchased. Local spot sales slightly inquired, while hoarders were hesitant to press down prices further and instead adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Sellers were eager to sell off their stocks as the end of the lunar year approached. Thus, despite market activity, the situation remained similar to the previous market. Throughout the day, the Fuzhou firm purchased 820 bags of Hunan machine-milled red rice at a price of 6.62 yuan, and 200 bags of Jing rice at a price of 5.85 yuan. The Yong firm purchased 634 bags of machine-milled oil rice at prices ranging from 7.27 yuan to 6.85 yuan. Furthermore, they jointly purchased 588 bags of Mingguang machine-milled Xian rice with a Guangzhou firm at a price of 6.55 yuan. Local firms purchased 500 bags of Shashi machine-milled Xian rice at a price of 6.15 yuan, 80 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled late rice at a price of 7.25 yuan, and 200 bags of Xiang machine-milled oil rice at a price of 7.15 yuan. The market was originally sluggish, but after the active purchases by local firms, it slightly stabilized, it was said.</p>
<h3>Soybean Prices Secretly Reduced by Two or Three Fen</h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean market has been sluggish since the arrival of a surge of cargo. Although various firms have inquired, the buying momentum is weak, and prices have secretly been reduced by two or three fen. Yesterday, exports and local trucking firms together transacted in 100 bags of Xuzhou large-grain soybeans at a price of 3.7 yuan. Two cars of Yingzhou beans were priced at 3.33 yuan to 3.31 yuan. One car of Feihe beans was priced at 3.38 yuan. One car of Huaiyuan beans was priced at 3.27 yuan. One car of Bengbu beans was priced at 3.10 yuan. 400 bags of Dangshan beans were priced at 3.37 yuan to 3.35 yuan. Three cars of Zhengyangguan beans were priced at 3.43 yuan to 3.40 yuan. Local firms transacted in 150 bags of Dalian beans at a price of 4.40 yuan. Yong firms purchased 50 bags of Pinghu Du beans at a price of 4.90 yuan. The market was slightly stabilized. Green beans were considered a specialty product, and the market was relatively average. Yesterday, a Fuzhou firm purchased 410 bags at a price of 3.28 yuan, it was said.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Longkou Vermicelli Suddenly Rises by Six Jiao</h3>
<p>Longkou vermicelli has recently become active due to winter sales, and the market has suddenly tightened. Passenger goods have therefore risen. Yesterday, it was heard that one hundred and several dozen bags were sold at a price of 17.80 yuan, an increase of six jiao compared to the previous market. Furthermore, spot goods are scarce, and there is not much inventory in the origin. According to telegraphic reports, the current market price is 22 yuan (per bag), and the market has already tightened.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: New Brick Green Opens at 8.3 Yuan</h3>
<p>Although there was no significant change in customs gold or Dutch exchange rates in yesterday's sugar market, the sluggishness did not diminish slightly. The Association set the price for grade 24 coarse sand white ordinary goods at 19.5 yuan, a slight decrease of 0.05 yuan compared to the previous day. Transshipment goods were quoted at 6.30 yuan, but no transactions were made. Dutch red sugar remained unchanged. Grade 8 sugar was priced at 15.4 yuan, grade 9 at 15.4 yuan, and Taikoo Sugar B mark was quoted at 19.95 yuan, with no transactions. Local factory refined white sugar continued to fall by 0.05 yuan, with Zhenji grade 1 at 18.1 yuan, grade 2 at 17.9 yuan, grade 3 at 17.7 yuan, and grade 4 at 17.5 yuan. Chao Qing and Diao Qing both lacked new openings, and the trend looked to continue to loosen. New jade-green opened dozens of baskets yesterday at a price of 8.3 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Embroidery: Overseas Factory Prices Remain Low</h3>
<p>London Shantung Dry Embroidery Prices Reported to Fall Again. Since the limitation of Japanese silk in the London market, the price of Chinese silk was still able to hold at the end of last year. Since the opening of the new year's market, factory sales have been stagnant and prices have shifted to flat and sluggish. According to news from the local British firm, Taikoo Foreign Firm, the London opening price for Shantung Dry Embroidery on Monday was reported to fall: Grade A Xiulin and Feima brands were priced at only 6 shillings and 10.5 pence per pound, and Grade B Black Lion brand was priced at 6 shillings and 1.5 pence, each falling by 1.5 pence. Because the French exchange rate has lengthened, the combined Chinese currency has fallen only slightly, with each package falling by only 2 to 3 yuan.</p>
<p>Sichuan and Hubei Silk Top Sources are Not Smooth Sichuan and Hubei Silk Tops sources have been difficult to smooth for a long time. Since the presentation of the year, a total of only 78 pieces such as turban handshakes have been loaded on each river vessel, it is said.</p>
<p>Foreign Firm Silk Prices are Slightly Stagnant Overseas raw silk markets have lacked new developments since the presentation of the year. The various silk weaving factories are all adopting a tightening policy due to the sluggish business last year. Raw silk sales have still decreased. The general importers suffered losses last year and lacked a subject for their remaining silk, so they did not dare to take risks. Although each European firm in Shanghai received overseas telegrams yesterday, the factory prices that were yellow and white-washed were still small, so the market was dismissed and there were few transactions for current silk, it was said.</p>
<h3>Native Firm Bead Flowers Slightly Sold</h3>
<p>Since the New Year, the tea market in this local foreign firm has been extremely desolate. Recently, the batches of native firm Zhenmei telegraphs issued by various foreign firms have received no response. Only two items of native firm shrimp-eye tea were purchased by Douty Foreign Firm yesterday for more than forty boxes. The rest of the colors such as needle-eye and show-eye had no transactions. Foreign firm representatives believe that foreign tea sales are weak, and they plan to delay the shipping of goods purchased last year for export, it is said.</p>
<h3>Metals</h3>
<p>Spot Tin Greatly Lacking</p>
<p>The current tin market is surprisingly brisk, because there is little arrival and thin storage, sales are very strong, and the fixed price has seen an increase, so this port's standards have also prospered as a result. The price opened by the Dutch can be sold to 208 yuan per dan, full weight to 210 yuan, and small offer to 190 yuan. Fighting tin 200 yuan, it is said that six to seven hundred dan have been opened every day.</p>

<h3>"Women's National Goods Year" and a Discussion of Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>— Mu</p>
<p>After dinner, I read the evening paper and was struck by the eye-catching headline "The First Outpouring of Japanese Goods in the New Year," with the subheadline stating "Over a Thousand Tons Already Imported, Japanese Chamber of Commerce President Optimistic." There's no need to discuss the content of the news anymore; one has already learned a bit of "that." And this "that" should be repeatedly and solemnly declared, not daring to loudly scold, but... just a bit "that," I suppose.</p>
<p>Last year was designated as "National Goods Year," but this year it has been changed to "Women's National Goods Year." This clearly tells us that: (1) men were not sincerely buying national goods during last year's "National Goods Year" campaign, or they bought them with excessive enthusiasm, so this year, men are not needed or shouldn't buy national goods anymore; (2) women are enthusiastically buying national goods, or not enthusiastic enough, so this year welcomes or hopes that women will buy national goods. If my further speculation is not wrong, then naturally this year's responsibility for buying national goods rests on the shoulders of our female compatriots, and male compatriots can ignore it. Logically speaking, female compatriots haven't shouldered much responsibility for the country's and society's affairs. This year, they are being asked to take on the patriotic cause of revitalizing national goods, which is appropriate, so most people greatly approve of it. However, from another perspective, the patriotic cause of revitalizing national goods being exclusively the responsibility of female compatriots, while male compatriots can ignore it, wouldn't that make the male compatriots envious, or even a bit embarrassed? And are male compatriots not buying national goods anymore? After not buying national goods, is it permissible or appropriate to buy Japanese goods? This is what male compatriots find difficult to decide. A friend of mine jokingly said to me: A certain artist wants to create a series of paintings, with the first painting depicting a couple leaving home and encountering a neighbor's wife. The neighbor's wife asks, "Where are you going?" They reply, "To buy something." The second painting shows the couple at a tram stop, with the wife asking, "Where's the best place to buy things?" The gentleman replies, "Go to Wusong Road." The third painting shows the couple on the tram, with the wife strangely asking, "What's good to buy on Wusong Road?" The gentleman replies very seriously, "Japanese goods, of course." The people on the tram are puzzled, with many "?" question marks exploding above their heads. The fourth painting shows them still on the tram, with the wife again strangely asking, "Why buy Japanese goods?" The gentleman replies very solemnly, "This year is your Women's National Goods Year!" At this point, the men on the tram smile, while the women are unhappy... This friend is a male compatriot, and his telling me this story naturally means he agrees with the artist's satire, which shows that this male compatriot at least doesn't greatly approve of this "Women's National Goods Year," a campaign where female compatriots exclusively shoulder the patriotic cause of revitalizing national goods. Although he is not necessarily "envious" or "a bit embarrassed," and as for male compatriots "not buying national goods anymore," some people have already angrily advocated "buying Japanese goods."</p>
<p>The reason why the "President of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce" in this city is "very optimistic," I think, is perhaps that they understand that we Chinese already "distinguish between men and women" when buying things, with female compatriots buying national goods and male compatriots buying Japanese goods. Therefore, "the first outpouring of Japanese goods in the New Year" is to meet the needs of our male compatriots and promote "Sino-Japanese friendship." That's why I feel a bit "that" after reading the evening paper... it's just a bit "that," I suppose.</p>
<h3>This New Year's Day</h3>
<p>— Hu</p>
<p>The New Year, the twenty-third New Year of the Republic of China, finally arrived amidst fervent anticipation; now, it has become a past relic. If you were to tell me to force myself to find something satisfying in that relic, that would simply be impossible. However, a few fragmented events are oddly, comically, and deeply imprinted in my memory, making it impossible for me to erase them for the time being.</p>
<p>It was this morning, just after I had listlessly and seemingly dejectedly dragged my slippers out of the washroom, when a loud "Happy New Year" wave erupted from the mouth of a man approaching me. Because I wasn't prepared, I was startled. Although I don't quite understand the exact meaning of this foreign phrase, it's said that friends should exchange greetings during "New Year's," so I immediately understood a bit, knowing that the person likely had no ill intentions. Thus, I mustered my courage and gave him a few glances. He smiled. "Hey, putting on airs! Greeting you for the New Year, and you don't even understand!" Wasn't I right? I'm glad I exercised some patience, otherwise, misunderstanding a good person for not understanding a foreign language, or even yelling at him, wouldn't that have been embarrassing? However, as soon as that thought passed, a swarm of unreleased doubts closely followed. Initially, I only doubted my eyes, thinking I hadn't fully woken up and that the person must be a foreigner. But that was immediately refuted because he was definitely a fellow suffering Chinese just like me, with a yellow face and black hair. He was wearing Chinese clothes, and apart from the foreign phrase he used to greet me, which he explained, he spoke fluent and excellent Chinese. What could he use to hide or explain that he wasn't Chinese? During a "time of national crisis," I have no opposition to or reason for opposing New Year's greetings, but greeting people for the New Year by speaking in a foreign accent, and that foreign accent coming from the mouth of a yellow-faced, black-haired Chinese person, can't help but make me feel comically strange and inwardly experience a vague sense of pain and sorrow!</p>
<p>It was also this morning when I got the newspaper and started flipping through it, naturally hoping to find some good, interesting, and fresh things in those dozen or so pages. Indeed, as soon as my eyes focused, I discovered a miracle! But this "miracle" wasn't as miraculous as the "Cai Tingkai narrowly escaped bombing" or "Women's National Goods Year" "automobile parade" and other such miracles prominently printed in black and white in the newspapers a few days ago. It was just a small advertisement, only an inch wide and a few inches long. But because this advertisement was related to the "New Year" and its owner was a dignified and prominent member of the central committee, I diligently opened my eyes to read. It was written like this: "During a time of national crisis, please excuse 'no New Year's greetings'" in large characters. So, I found it strange and peculiar. But after a moment, I realized that this was an artistic New Year's greeting advertisement. If it were more fashionable, it would probably be some kind of "humor," or some kind of reverse article!</p>
<p>It was in the afternoon, still wearing my lined jacket, walking alone on a road swept by cold winds. I went from the southernmost point of Seymour Road, passed Jing'an Temple Road, turned west, and walked from Xiaoshadu Road to Connaught Road. On this stretch of road alone, I encountered a total of thirty-eight men, women, old, and young bowing and kneeling to me. A third of this group were children, all asking me for copper coins, and so earnestly at that, that I was embarrassed and gave each of them a coin. Finally, they all told me that they had fled from the countryside to Shanghai.</p>
<p>None of this is strange, in this society!</p>
<p>This phenomenon is very natural and very inevitable.</p>
<p>Also this afternoon, K received his double salary for the year twenty-two, and was extremely happy. He wanted me to accompany his friends to the movies. I followed them to "Grand Theater," but it was "full." We turned to "Carlton," but it was also "full." "Great Shanghai" was even more crowded, and the "full" sign was also prominently displayed. "Damn it, let's go to a hotel," K led the way into "Yangtze River." The receptionist apologized and replied with pride, "Sorry, no vacant rooms." We went to "Nanjing," but it was the same. We were lucky to finally occupy a small corner room on the sixth floor of "Great China."</p>
<p>This is even less strange! In this society, this phenomenon is even more natural and even more inevitable. But this kind of crazy "last burst of light" before the collapse of a contradictory and deformed society is another clear and confirmed reflection here.</p>
<p>It was two o'clock in the morning. I was exhausted and said goodbye to them, trudging home with heavy steps. Upon seeing the bed, I fell asleep immediately. However, in this night, I dreamed again of a large group of hideous and terrifying demons and monsters!</p>

<h3>A Visit to the Tuosheng Theater Troupe's Public Performance (Continued)</h3>
<p>The third act opens, already several years later. Ya Luo and Lu Shi are running the house, and their daughter is already seven or eight years old. Because Ya Luo is a dreamer, only knowing how to read but not how to farm, their father resents his older brother Ya An for sailing and becomes ill and dies. Their family business gradually declines, and life becomes more difficult. When the curtain opens, Lu Shi's mother – an old woman with paralysis who cannot walk – sits in a wheeled chair and talks to Ya Luo's mother, saying that she heard Ya Luo's mother has mortgaged the farmland to someone else. How did it come to this! The old mother sighs, hoping for the return of her eldest son, Ya An. Lu Shi leads their daughter, who has been playing outside, in. The makeup is completely different. In the first act, she was a lively little girl, but now she is a dignified young woman. Her mother wants to go outside to bask in the sun, and Ya Luo's mother accompanies her out. She pushes the wheeled chair into the back, then comes out and coaxes the little girl to sleep, but the little girl refuses to sleep. Ya Nong enters, his youth lost, very haggard, already a middle-aged man. He loves the little girl, and the little girl also loves her father. She goes into the kitchen to prepare dinner for him, and he puts the little girl to bed. The lullaby sung from backstage is very good. But upon entering the stage, he starts reading a book, even disregarding the dinner his wife brings him. This makes Lu Shi angry. At this time, their worker Peng En comes in to resign, saying that he cannot bear the farmers' ridicule, and he wants his wages, but he doesn't have them. What a great stimulus this is! His wife, Lu Shi, is very resentful of him at this time, regretting marrying him. They quarrel with each other, and Lu Shi even publicly says that she loves Ya An. She loves Ya An because she is already tired of the ordinary and trivial life. She often takes out the letters Ya An sends, reading, reciting, hoping that Ya An will return soon. What another great stimulus this is! The sound of a car horn calls outside. Lu Shi greets Ya An with great joy, asking him to stay and not go sailing again. The stimulation Ya Luo has received at this time is about to drive him crazy.</p>
<p>When the fourth act opens, another five years have passed. Ya Luo's mother has died, and his little girl, his lovely little girl, has also died. He has suffered from the stimulation of business failure, the stimulation of his wife's infidelity. He has contracted a severe lung disease and is about to die. When the curtain opens, the paralyzed old woman is still alive, warming herself by the stove and falling asleep. Ya Luo comes out of the inner room, and Lu Shi gestures to him not to wake her mother. He is very angry. Lu Shi's makeup is different again this time. Youth has vanished with time. Her haggard face and tattered clothes show that she is already a middle-aged woman who has experienced many hardships. Ms. Li Ying plays the roles of a young girl, a young woman, and a middle-aged woman in this play, and she is truly successful. If she entered the film industry, I believe her success would be even greater. That's a digression. Speaking of the play, Ya Luo is talking to himself, wondering why Ya An isn't back yet. Lu Shi says that she sent a telegram and that he will definitely be back sooner or later. After some conversation, she can't hold on any longer and goes back into the room. The sound of a car horn calls outside again, waking the old woman who is sleeping by the stove. Fearing that people will see this tattered person, she tells her daughter Lu Shi to push her into the kitchen. Ya An brings a doctor into the room. Ya An is now a middle-aged man with a beard, and his appearance has changed to that of a city merchant. He greets Lu Shi and urgently asks the doctor to go into the inner room to see Ya Luo's illness. While the doctor is examining the patient, Ya An comes out and questions Lu Shi as to why she didn't tell him about Ya Luo's illness sooner. He loves his brother, and he knows that his brother is ill because of Lu Shi's infidelity. He cannot forgive Lu Shi, and he firmly states that he does not love Lu Shi. The doctor comes out after examining the patient, saying that he cannot be saved and leaves. How sad Ya An is! Unexpectedly, Ya Luo comes out of the room, sick, and collapses in a chair, advising Ya An to love Lu Shi, saying that after he dies, he wants Ya An to take Lu Shi as his wife. Lu Shi sobs loudly, and Ya An helps him into the inner room to sleep. Ya An heavily blames Lu Shi and recounts how he struggled with financial capitalists in the stock exchange and failed, which is why he is now willing to return home to farm. He also feels very bleak about the future. Unexpectedly, when they go into the inner room to check on the patient, the patient has escaped through the window.</p>
<p>The plot has really reached its peak at this point and can end, so most of the audience leaves. It is said that there is still one more act, so I continue to sit, but there are only ten or twenty people in the audience. I hear someone on stage say, "Everyone has left, so let's not perform. Zhao Dan, go out and report." But then I hear our female lead shouting, "Perform! Perform! Even if no one is here, we'll keep performing!" So the stagehands get busy. Indeed, acting should be true to art, and one should keep performing even if there is only one audience member. (The Nanguo Society had such an incident a few years ago: they started the performance with only one audience member.) The fifth act is in the wilderness. Ya Luo cries out sadly and crazily, "Freedom!" "My starting point for sailing!" He falls to the ground and dies. Ya An and Lu Shi chase after him, but it is already too late. The result is a tragedy. It is already one o'clock in the morning of the New Year when the show ends.</p>
<p>Overall, the female lead was successful. The scenery and lighting were good. In particular, all the actors were performing seriously, diligently, and earnestly. This is admirable for the new theater troupe's first public performance. I wish them continued effort.</p>

<h3>Chinese People and Goods Going Abroad</h3>
<h3>Past and Present</h3>
<p>— Jing Jia</p>
<p>Is the past good, or is the present good? I believe everyone will answer that the past was good. An old person cannot help but feel satisfied when thinking about their youth. People living in the present world are all dissatisfied with the present and yearn for the past era. "Dissatisfied with the present and envious of the past" is a common fantasy of mankind.</p>
<p>In fact, the world is progressing day by day. The present is only better than the past, and the past will never be better than the present. Let me give an example. According to the older generation, twenty years ago, it would take at least four hours to get from Caojiadu to Tilanqiao. However, now we can traverse this great city, Shanghai, in forty minutes. From this point, we can know that the present is better than the past. This can be proven in every way.</p>
<p>"Dissatisfied with the present and yearning for the past" is a human thought, but we absolutely cannot say that this thought is wrong. At the same time, we cannot add the crime of insatiability to the heads of people with this thought. Because the reason why society can have endless evolution is because it thrives on this thought. People's dissatisfaction with the present enables society to progress.</p>
<p>However, we cannot say that simply having this thought will cause society to progress on its own. For example, if we feel that our hands are not clean, our hands will not become clean unless we put them in water and wash them. Therefore, when we have dissatisfaction with the present, we should transform that dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>The "past" is never recoverable. The era of Yao and Shun has no possibility of reappearing in the present world. Do not yearn for the "past"; let us transform our "present"! Because we are all people of the present!</p>
<h3>An Old Man on the Street</h3>
<p>— Man</p>
<p>One windy, bleak, and rainy evening, as I was about to cross Hualong Road from Luban Road and head to a quiet road in a foreign residential area, an old man carrying a noodle cart was walking in front of me, staggering. Suddenly, he somehow slipped and fell to the ground, and the bowls and plates on the noodle cart shattered. I went forward and helped him up. He burst into tears, which streamed down his pale and withered face. Passersby gathered around to watch the commotion. Weeping, he said, "My family depends on me for food, and now I can't do business!" He had a Jiangbei accent, as if he came from the countryside. The passersby looked and then walked away, everyone sneering at him. I gave him some small change, telling him to be careful when walking in the future. A foreign lady saw this from upstairs and asked her servant to give him some copper coins. The servant, a Chinese compatriot, said with a smile, "Hey, the foreign lady gave you this. Do that again, and it won't be good for business." This was an insult to him. I glared at the servant angrily. He seemed to understand my thoughts and said to me, "He fell on purpose. Look at his noodle cart, it's not even presentable!" I looked at his noodle cart, which was not only unlit but also dusty. It turned out this was a con! I myself found it funny and walked away. But all along the way, I kept thinking about this incident: How did that old man come up with this way of life?...</p>

<h3>Entanglement of Ticket Funds</h3>
<p>Payment by Draft</p>
<p>(Original Signature Verified)</p>
<p>Mr. So-and-so's Precious Firm (D): A certain amount of silver dollars.</p>
<p>Mr. So-and-so's Precious Firm (C) to be Verified and Cashed: Month ○, Day ○.</p>
<p>Seal: Ticket (B)</p>
<p>According to established custom, the drawer of the above draft directly hands it over to the drawee mentioned on the draft, and the words "Original Signature Verified" are stamped on the draft to indicate the nature of the draft and to remind the endorsee to pay attention. In principle, the drawer does not bear any responsibility to the endorsee who holds the draft. Now, an endorsee, Mr. A, holds a draft with the same nature as the above, issued in the 17th year of the Republic of China, for a certain amount of silver dollars, and is unreasonably making trouble with the drawer, Mr. B, intending to muddle through. I don’t know if the drawer, Mr. B, has failed to complete all the procedures, resulting in legal liability? Even if the procedures are incomplete, it has been more than five years. Has the validity period of this draft expired due to the passage of time? I beg Mr. to provide a detailed explanation, and it would be greatly appreciated if you could provide a direct reply as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted by Li Da Shen Shen Zhuang</p>

<p>Editor's Note: There are three parties involved in a draft: (1) The drawer, Mr. B in the above ticket; (2) The payee, also known as the drawee, Mr. D; (3) The payer, Mr. C. The issuance of this draft indicates that Mr. B should pay Mr. D the same amount as stated on the draft on the agreed date. Because Mr. C also needs to pay Mr. B, to save procedures, Mr. B issued this draft, instructing Mr. D to directly cash it with Mr. C. According to usual practice, after obtaining this draft, Mr. D should immediately present it to Mr. C, who should immediately stamp the back of the draft to acknowledge payment, which is called "acceptance." After the acceptance procedure, Mr. C should deduct this amount from the payment owed to Mr. B. Therefore, the responsibility for payment has been transferred to the payer, Mr. C, and the drawer, Mr. B, only bears the responsibility for guaranteeing payment. Although the draft is marked with the words "Original Signature Verified," the payee, Mr. D, can still stamp the back of the draft and endorse it to the endorsee. When it is due, the endorsee can demand payment from the drawer or the payer. If the drawee is untraceable or unable to pay when it is due, the drawer cannot refuse to pay the draft to the endorsee based on the words "Original Signature Verified," because doing so would violate the legal provision of "issuing a false draft to facilitate another person's crime." In the letter above, the endorsee, Mr. A, is not negotiating with Mr. D, but directly negotiating with the drawer. The current situation of Mr. D is probably either untraceable or unable to pay. The drawer's responsibilities in this regard are as follows:</p>
<p>A. The payment has already been taken by the payee by falsely claiming that it was lost. Even in this situation, there are three different responsibilities:</p>
<p>(1) If Mr. D declared the loss and had a statement published in a newspaper recognized by the court before the payment was taken, then the drawer does not bear any responsibility, and the endorsee can only find a way to negotiate with Mr. D.</p>
<p>(2) If no statement was published in the newspaper at the time, but Mr. B issued a written statement and asked an intermediary to witness it, then this written statement cannot be used to resist an uninformed third party, Mr. A. The drawer should be responsible for handling the matter properly and instruct the intermediary to deal with Mr. D.</p>
<p>(3) If there were no procedures at the time due to the friendship between the parties, then the drawer can only admit the error in the procedure and settle the loss.</p>
<p>B. The payment has not been made, but because of the words "Original Signature Verified," the drawer is afraid that Mr. D may be untraceable now, and disputes may arise in the future, and therefore refuses to pay. In this case, Mr. B can ask Mr. A to issue a written statement, have a reliable guarantor, and then collect the payment. He cannot refuse to pay simply because five years have passed.</p>

<h3>Prison Notes (5)</h3>
<p>— Wheel</p>
<p>This sports leader used to be a performer at the Confucius Temple in Nanjing, and his actions revealed that. Once, when he was leading sports, he only allowed sports and not talking when he was giving instructions. His speaking position was at the window of the weaving factory. At that time, two prisoners were talking softly. He thought that someone in his team was talking!! He snapped his head back like a spring, stretched his neck very long, and opened his eyes wide like the eyes of Zhang Fei in our imagination. At this time, he was like standing on the Ba Ling Bridge shouting at the eighty-three thousand soldiers!! "Ptooey!"</p>
<p>"Saliva sprayed on the faces of the people at the window like mist. This sound and action easily reminded people of storytellers shouting a few times, "One two!! One two three four!" His voice sounded like it was coming from behind a partition wall.</p>
<p>Sometimes he does some freehand exercises, which he completely fabricated, or learned from children!! When our bodies are extremely bent downward and forward, and our lungs are so compressed that it is difficult to breathe, we are still asked to shout loudly; when we bend backward and upward with our waist, and even our throats cannot squeeze out a sound, we are also asked to shout. He doesn't care about the bad effects on your physiology.</p>
<p>Before our breathing and posture have returned to a calm state, he stuffs us into the prison cell to breathe air that is not very circulating.</p>
<p>Now our sports field is a rectangle defined by the straight lines of the buildings of three prison cells and a head wall. Exercise is just lining up and turning in a circle, and there is little movement. The place where we often step has become a circular yellow sandy road.</p>
<p>On Saturday, I and Wu counted our steps. Each circle was eighty-eight steps, and we turned sixteen circles. If we calculate it using infantry exercises at one hundred and forty steps per minute, it is only nine and one-third minutes!! This is considered by him!! The one who beats the big drum. I am not belittling him; that is what everyone calls him, and I cannot remember his surname. It is easier to remember this nickname than the surname!! The longest, the very longest, the most generous gift to the prisoners, and he feels satisfied when he thinks of it.</p>
<p>Labor that is many times more than the work necessary to perform the job is excessive labor in his eyes. Serving prisoners has become management and has become mandatory and charitable in nature. Prisoners cannot demand anything from him; demanding is resisting or causing trouble, and there is a risk of being nailed in shackles or beaten with a board.</p>
<p>On average, prisoners can only stay in that large!! sports field, which is hundreds of times larger than the prison cell, for one minute each day. This is the actual content of what we can go to the activity brigade at 28:00 or all day that Mai Guanren heard in his ears.</p>
<p>In this prison, the open space is so much, so enticing; but it is so narrow and useless!</p>

<h3>World Literary Masterpieces and Chinese Films (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Luo Ping</p>
<p>Then can we conclude that "The Sorrows of Young Werther" and "Immensee" are needed on the silver screen? Our answer is "No."</p>
<p>If "Roar, China!" which accurately depicts the anti-imperialist movement of the Chinese people, is worth introducing, why don't we introduce it to the silver screen?</p>
<p>Also, why don't we put "The First European Flag" by Japanese author Tomoyoshi Murayama, which depicts a crucial historical turning point in modern Chinese history—the Opium War of 1840, when imperialism invaded China and began to transform late feudal China into a colony—on the silver screen?</p>
<p>It is said that some people are thinking of putting these two stage plays on the silver screen, which is welcome news. Taking a step back, even if we are writing love stories, shouldn't we put more meaningful works, such as Ms. Ke Yutai's "The Divisions of Love," on the silver screen?</p>
<p>In the future of literary works and film exchange, we see terrible shadows.</p>
<p>"Spring Silkworms," a completely new type, has already been put on the silver screen. In addition, the first type is the "Twice Blooming Plum Blossom" type of feudal social relations between the sexes, followed by the "Qianlong Emperor's Tour of Jiangnan" type of feudal social bushido and direct advocacy of feudal social preaching, then the purely idealistic, escapist "Waiting-ism" type of "The Strange Swordsman of the Jianghu," and then the butterfly and mandarin duck school of novels with enlarged feet. However, purely liberal literature has not been combined with film. Perhaps the author is ignorant and does not know. We might as well regard the bringing of "The Sorrows of Young Werther" and "Immensee" to the silver screen as the first exchange between liberal literature and Chinese film.</p>
<p>"Twice Blooming Plum Blossom," "Qianlong's Visit to Jiangnan," and even "The Strange Swordsman of the Jianghu" can be said to be things of the past. The advance of "Spring Silkworms"-type film works will reach the limits given by the current society, and can only develop greatly in the next generation, just like a chick breaking its shell's barrier.</p>
<p>Novels of the butterfly and mandarin duck school, and even new novels of the butterfly and mandarin duck school, can undoubtedly thrive in this era. "The Sorrows of Young Werther" and "Immensee" are their teachers, although there are large but not fundamental differences between them.</p>
<p>Finally, I must point out that efforts to introduce world literary masterpieces are not needed; on the contrary, because of the lack of truly successful works in modern Chinese literature, there is a very urgent need to borrow "Roar, China!" from the Soviet Union and introduce the Japanese "The First European Flag."</p>
<p>Regarding the adaptation of Chinese literary works into film scripts, I have one more opinion: although China lacks successful works, putting them on the silver screen is essentially rewriting them. Then we may as well carefully revise the shortcomings contained in the works. In other words, we also need to critically bring modern Chinese literature to the silver screen. (End)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "Unfinished Destiny"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>One Way Passage</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>When we read novels by Alexandre Dumas fils or Oscar Wilde, their intense emotions and profound depictions often surprise and amaze us, and we admire their wonderful genius. Naturally, that kind of extremely mature old technique is only enough to express old content. The main reason why "La Dame aux Camélias" or "Salome" can compel other people's emotions is due to their formal success.</p>
<p>Similarly, we can cite many successful works in film. Although they are old things, their value has gradually disappeared, but the extremely mature methods are still enough for us to appreciate. "Romola" can make non-Christians sympathize with the fate of Christians, and "Lucky Dog" can make people pity the sorrow of dogs; even poisonous preaching cannot lack florid language. Naturally, we will never forget the famous saying of critical learning, and under the purpose of appreciation, it is still necessary to analyze and review all old art.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Mass-produced American films are often criticized for their outdated or poisonous content. However, there are still many valuable achievements in the old-style works. There is no need to list the past ones, but this Warner Bros. production of "Unfinished Destiny" is worth our considerable attention.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Warner Bros. Pictures produces many works that are quite valuable, although its products are not as abundant as those of MGM or Paramount. It is said that Warner makes a lot of exposé films, which immediately reminded me of "The Working Man", which premiered at the Cathay last year. Of course, there will never be anything very sharp, but things like "The Working Man's" depiction of the business competition of small businessmen in the depression era is indeed very profound. In addition, the "Great Mogul" regaining health through labor also seems very reasonable in some places. Now, this "Unfinished Destiny," which is in the form of an ethical film and expresses the sadness of a gangster before his death, in the current situation where people generally have no reason to deeply hate bandits, is not a passive stimulus to the established mentality.</p>
<p>Some people may think that my explanation is neurotic and too lenient, because they believe that the screenwriter simply wrote a moving story to suit William Powell's character, and accidentally adopted the theme of a gangster. However, we must always believe that artists will never adopt themes without selection. The themes that have passed through rigorous thinking are the expression of the author's own thoughts; therefore, William Powell plays a dashing gangster in both "Jewel Robbery" and this film, but the two give people completely different impressions.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Aside from this point, the screenwriter is indeed very clever in creating the script. One is a gangster who has already been sentenced to death, is at large, and is arrested again overseas and escorted back to the country from Hong Kong for execution. The other is suffering from a very dangerous heart disease and is being protected back to the country from Hong Kong by a doctor. Both are people who are not long before their death, but they fall in love at first sight. Under the internal conflict between life and death, they have to enjoy the last pleasures of life to the fullest before they die. In such a desolate and mournful situation, are you still afraid that there will be no good drama? Are you still afraid that you will not be able to capture the audience's emotions?</p>
<p>Needless to say, the protagonist is the gangster. So now let's see how the screenwriter created this gangster?</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the screenwriter has infinite sympathy for the protagonist. Because of this, he positively depicts his momentary sorrow before his death, and at the same time writes another thief who is very funny and very lovable. On the one hand, we can certainly see that many thieves are unfortunately executed, and at the same time, many thieves are unfortunately produced. On the other hand, the author does not directly explain the reasons for the gangster's crimes, and since the death sentence has been pronounced, the so-called crimes have already been stated in the legal provisions. What is the need for defense and explanation?</p>
<p>Due to the screenwriter's abnormal resentment and his excessive sympathy for the gangster, he wrote the protagonist in his free ideal as a superhuman hero. Death is death, what does it matter! So the first time he dragged the detective into the sea, he did not kill him and escape, but just gave him a warning. The second time he was fully prepared to escape, but he made him bravely sacrifice for love. Naturally, these are all things beyond reason, but here it shows the author's ideological errors. In addition, he wrote the thief as a lovable drunkard, writing him as childish and innocent. He himself certainly makes people laugh, but his cold laughter is enough to make the gentlemen uncomfortable. I think the screenwriter has indeed beautifully achieved the goal of describing the sorrows of life in modern society with a negative attitude.</p>
<p>As for the exaggeration of love supremacy, it is no different from ordinary American screenwriters, and I think there is no need to mention it repeatedly here.</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>Due to the successful performances of William Powell and Kay Francis, and the director's high skills, we can cite the following advantages to illustrate the director's cleverness.</p>
<p>(1) Using the length of cigarette ash to record the time when lazy people are in love by the stone cave. (2) The thief steals a passerby's purse, which turns out to be empty.</p>
<p>(3) When the gangster leaves a letter to his lover, he matches it with a monotonous and quiet piano sound, which completely expresses the inner desolation at that time.</p>
<p>(4) When San Francisco is already in sight, a very simple image of the guillotine is drawn to illustrate the protagonist's intense mood without revealing it.</p>
<p>(5) In the New Year's lively scene, only the thief raises his cup silently, and the poetic meaning of endless regret completely fills the audience's hearts.</p>
<p>There is no need to list all the other exquisite techniques of American films in this film.</p>
<h3>Announcement for the "Youth Fire Special Issue" of Tianyi Company</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>On the 5th of this month, the cover of this publication featured half a page of the "Youth Fire Special Issue" of Tianyi Company. Originally, this was nothing to be alarmed about. At most, it can be said that it did not indicate that it was an advertisement and should have included the words "This page is an advertisement," right? But it has caused many film publications in the same industry to make a fuss, which is really unsettling.</p>
<p>The editor of this publication originally wanted to clarify that</p>
<p>it was a matter for the advertising department, not the editorial department of the film special issue. One party did not notify, and the other party had no way of asking. However, afterwards, I thought that this matter did not need to be clarified. Which knowledgeable reader would believe that this publication compiled a special issue for Tianyi Company?</p>
<p>As for the various rumors outside, this publication does not care about them at all. The editor has not seen them at all and has no way to defend them. I would like to advise everyone in the most sincere manner to avoid all unnecessary and boring disputes, attacks, and competitions. Even if you win the world, it is just a matter of gain and loss for chickens and worms, so why bother starting a war of words in this pile of paper during the good New Year?</p>
<h3>Review of "Male Matchmaker"</h3>
<p>— Yi Qun</p>
<p>Olsen's Big Moment</p>
<p>If people unanimously agree that film art is just something for young masters and ladies to use as entertainment after tea and wine, then naturally there is no need to say more about it, let alone for us to criticize it. But if there are still some people who feel that film, whether its form of expression is comedy or tragedy, literary drama or martial drama, love or farce... should at least contain something more meaningful to enlighten the audience or alert the audience, to fulfill its small part of responsibility to society, then for this "Male Matchmaker" farce, I feel that there is still a need for criticism and pointing out.</p>
<p>Of course, we admit that comedy production has many objective and difficult-to-solve conditions, such as the collection of materials, the naturalness of the performance, and the authenticity of the materials and performance, which are really not easy to please. However, on the subjective side of the producer, we believe that if he can deeply understand the social use of this film art and is willing to humbly use it, he may not produce something that satisfies people.</p>
<p>Charlie Chaplin, as everyone knows, the reason why his works rarely have unprincipled and foolish disturbances is based on his ability to understand the use of this film art.</p>
<p>On the contrary, we watched this "Male Matchmaker" flicker piece by piece on the silver screen, and all the way to exiting the theater, we didn't get any influence at all. Although the director Malcolm St. Clair spent a lot of energy on general technical gimmicks and maintained the advantages of general American dramas, the handling of this story itself can't help but make people feel disappointed! The main purpose of this play could have started from the widow Fan氏 admiring Robert's wealth and forcing her daughter Jenny to marry him, to satirize parents who generally do not care about the lifelong happiness of their children, but only focus on wealth, but he ignored this main point, pieced together lively and funny scenes, and did not hesitate to grab a very fierce villain, Meng Ke, who shamelessly came to pressure Robert to marry his sister in a public tavern, and the other people seemed to turn a blind eye. Is there such a thing in the world...</p>
<p>There are many other far-fetched and unnatural places, and there is no need to go into detail.</p>
<h3>Another South China New Film "Qiongdong Storm"</h3>
<p>— Shui Gong</p>
<p>The latest production of the Guangzhou Southwest Film Company, "Qiongdong Storm," was filmed by the company's film crew last year, who went deep into Qiongdong with the army to shoot on location. It takes the development of Qiongya as its theme and writes about the process of an overseas Chinese returning to his country to work hard on reclamation. It includes as much of the famous scenic spots of Qiong Island, such as Wuzhi Mountain and Hai Rui's ruins, as possible. The most commendable thing is that the film exposes the life of the Li and Miao people of Qiong Island for the first time. The film will premiere at the Beijing Grand Theater today. Correction: In yesterday's review of "Love Tide on the Border," the word Hervey in the last paragraph was a mistake for Fade. We hereby make a correction.</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3>The Cat and the Fiddle (1)</h3>
<p>— Mo Chen</p>
<p>Produced by MGM | Starring Ramón Novarro and Jeannette MacDonald</p>
<p>Young composer Victor and stage manager Dodd had an appointment to try out his newly composed song at five o'clock. But it's almost four o'clock now, and the song hasn't come to his mind yet. All that is in his mind is such a ridiculous silly tune, spinning around: "Hi diddle diddle... The Cat and</p>
<p>the Fiddle... The Cow jumped over the moon." These words were humming in his stomach and were about to become a tune, but he always wanted to compose that girl into it as well. Her charming eyes... strangely green, like the abyss in the sea. Her golden hair... like sunlight illuminating the world. Oh, her cherry lips... as red as the fire of love burning in a man's heart. And her frown... if she can be so heartbreakingly cute even when she frowns, then how earth-shattering should she be when she smiles! When she is coquettish, her slender feet stomp and her proud head is raised. A love song should be composed for her, and it cannot be done with hasty and vulgar slang.</p>
<p>This is how he met her: he was in a hurry to call for a streetcar. Coincidentally, a car stopped in front of him, and he jumped in without hesitation, or rather, he fell in, not knowing that there was already a woman sitting upright inside. When he saw her, he couldn't remember anything for a moment, only knowing that it was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen in his life. Not long ago, he was still thinking that everything in the world depended on him and Dodd's audition. But now everything is insignificant, only that woman, who he didn't know was there beforehand, is the only treasure in the world. He saw her name on the box piled under her feet: Shirley Sheridan... What a lovely name... Shirley, almost as lovely as she herself. She is still an American. He speculated in his heart about what she came to Brussels to do, and he also wanted to see if her mouth could curve into a smile. He also suddenly asked, "Do you believe in 'love at first sight'?"
