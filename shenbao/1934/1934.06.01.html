<h3 id="c28">塘沽恊定周年懷想抗日作戰之義勇軍 <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>— 廷</p>
<p>據各方調查。去年一年中。遼寗省内義軍出没數。多至六千二百九十八次。義軍累積人數不下四十六萬七千六百九十一人。首領一百三十四名。而吉黑𤍠河三省尙不與焉。本年一二兩月份。日軍動員應付各地義勇軍。共計爲四百另一次。出力員兵五萬三千八百七十六名。（僞軍除外。）義軍首領　百八十二名。部衆九萬七千六百三十八人。三月份義軍襲擊之統計。爲四千七百三十四次。首領二百七十七名。部衆一萬三千七百五十六人。首領中如東北義勇軍總司令王德林，副司令孔憲榮，華東救國軍總指揮張志超，皆有雄厚勢力。遼寗省之鳳城，安東，岫巖，通化。吉林省饒河，虎林，東寗，寗安，依蘭，（三姓）。黑龍江省之林甸，安達，海倫呼蘭，肇東。𤍠河省之五家子，三家子，　家溝　帶。義軍活動。最爲積極。其餘各地。亦無不有其足跡焉。</p>
<p>東北旣陷。當地義軍。迫於義憤。揭竿崛起。浴血作戰。裹創殺敵。使我不绝如縷。之國魂民氣賴以維繫而不墜斯眞如魯殿靈光彌可寳貴者也我悲壯𤍠烈之抗日勇士。其戰績其精神亦嘗聳動我關内人士之耳目而引起强摯之同情。奈自塘沽恊定之旣訂。後方接濟驟吿斷絶。義軍乃不得不各在堅苦奮鬭中而作最後之掙扎當此恊定簽訂周年之會懷想及我黑山白水間之抗日勇士。眞有不堪回首之感</p>
<p>一般國人對於義軍抗日運動之估價類多失之太低。以爲日人挾犀利之武器。與我組織散漫之義軍相對壘。直如摧枯拉朽不堪一擊因而感覺義軍之於僞組織。充其量亦不過爲癬疥之患。不足輕重其實此亦常情之推測而已。衡諸實際。尙未盡然。</p>
<p>吾人對於今義軍之抗日運動尙不必過於悲觀。其尤應認識者。則爲下述之事實。</p>
<p>（一）義軍抗日作戰。皆取游擊方策化整爲零各以小隊活動日軍追擊人數少則加以包圍聚殲。多則分散避往山林。日僞軍往往疲於奔命。而無如之何。　　（二）吉東三角地帶。（北界松花江南界烏蘇里河西界牡丹江）自九一八後。向爲義軍淵藪當地義軍現已憑據天險。挖成戰壕。一方率部實行計口援田制。分别屯懇自耕自給。一方選擇山林幽密處。訓練隊伍激勵士氣。此部義軍。最有組織。最具實力。遼黑𤍠諸省義軍。頗多聞風來歸。并聞凖備於本年六月中。完成一整個組織。長期抗日。最近將値靑紗帳起。日俄戰雲又逐漸濃密。吉東夾處日俄邊境。一旦國際情勢發生巨變。該地義軍。當爲東北日軍一嚴重之威脅。可斷言也。</p>
<p>（三）東北因特殊關係民衆備槍自衛者。由來已久日方爲對俄備戰及消滅義軍計。令僞滿收繳民槍。以防與義軍暗通聲氣。致爲後患。讵各縣民衆一則因感於難以隠避。再則恐將來舉事不易。反因是而互相聯絡。實行反抗。如𤍠河朝陽凌源錦西興城等縣人民三千餘人。聯合發難與駐在該處之日僞軍開戰。吉東富錦虎林一帶民衆。相率携槍入山。參加抗日工作卽未入山者亦寗願自動送槍於義軍不願繳納於日僞。其餘各縣除遼瀋海城盤山服從繳出外。亦均呈極混亂狀態。截至最近。形勢日益抗大。因日而促成農民與義軍之抗日聯合戰綫實堪注目。</p>
<p>（四）僞組織之軍隊。爲生活及環境所迫。並非甘心事敵。故其進攻義軍。每多虚張聲勢。不肯出力。偶遇適當機緣。卽倒戈反正。近數月來倒戈之風甚盛。如安圖營口撫松長白三姓蛟河各地皆有僞軍反正消息義軍聲勢爲之大振　　（五）日本侵我東北滿擬以東北之沃壤爲其一部分剩餘人口之性閭惟自實行移民以來。屢吿失敗。吉省佳木斯湖南營等處之武裝移民尤其慘淡經營之事業。竟亦因義軍之襲擊而感覺棘手。日人移民計劃之不易吿成義軍與有力焉。</p>
<p>凡此所述。或足矯正國人對於義軍抗日運動之認識勿以爲絶無遠大之影響。且義軍爲環境迫雖不能作恢復失地之雄圖而如許年來站在抗日戰陣之最前綫。百折不撓。勇往直前。其堅苦卓絶之精神與毅力總可爲國人之模範而値得最高之崇敬。塘沽協定之訂立旣爲鐵鑄事實往者已矣。固不必言。吾人對若輩站在最前綫之抗日作戰勇士。終將袖手旁觀而任其自生自滅乎。抑在靜待時機成熟而後予以𤍠烈之援助乎。</p>

<p>總委會今日開第三次會</p>
<p>英外相首先發言　　（日内瓦）今日軍縮總委員會開會後、英外相西門首先發方、以直率之言論陳述軍縮會氣象謂軍縮會地位及合作的努力的全部制度之重要、人皆知之、英政府致力於僵局之解决、迄未能獲一妥恊新基礎、渠極不滿意於延宕時日徒作空談之政策、軍縮會改爲籌議安全公約之會議、無補於事、今必須有實際的前進、而應付德國重置軍備的計畫、是否可爲國際協定的基礎之問題、渠主張立即成立草約、將業已議定之各條及必要的新讓步、一併歸納於内、渠建議三事（一）化學戰爭、（二）預算案、（三）成立永遠軍縮會是、英政府覺一月二十九日英國備忘錄所載之辦法、較諸任何具體提案仍更有產生一種恊定之可能、丹麥·西班牙·挪威·與瑞士四國代表所提出之備忘錄、與英國所提出者若合符節云、西門最後結語曰（軍縮會如不能採用此備忘錄中所載之建議、或與此相類之辦法則渠不信軍縮公約能以實下現）云、</p>

<p>法外長巴爾都繼起發言、對於西門之言論、與英政府之主張、駁斥甚力、頓使會塲空氣大爲緊張、謂着手安全問題、較易收效、甚於英國備忘錄所載之條文、法國嚴格遵守一九二五年英法恊定禁止軍火與戰具之輸出、（此言殆指英國以飛機引擎售與德國、而英政府諉爲純粹商業買賣一事而言、）觀於時局之艱難、今委婉順從或遷就讓步之時期、業已過去、渠知前未有天空攻擊惶慮之國、今以天空戰禍爲憂、但世界中尙有他國受陸軍與海軍之威脅、渠所欲知者、德國豈非脫離國聯、致使去年十月之恊定莫可實施乎、軍縮會豈能容許其本身侮蔑國聯之一國所操縱乎、英國曾請根據其認爲法國可欣然接受之理想、築一溝通法德之途徑、但法國則深慮有陷穽在焉、渠擁護法國四月十七日之備忘錄、觀於德國之軍費、可認明德國已增多其備戰經费、而法國則已减輕軍費矣、法國備忘錄從未封閉總恊定之門户、且請軍縮會繼續其工作、法國並擁護其一月一日之牒文、凡總委員會在安全範圍中所欲有之種種軍縮、此牒已供獻無遺云、</p>
<p>法外長巴爾都之言論、已使軍縮會復遇軍縮與安全孰急之問題矣、巴氏言論、間接涉及英外相西門在過去談判中之舉動、詞旣譏刺、且欠友好、引起一般批評、據旁聽者之意見、法外長之語調、已摧毁英法間諒解之可能性、主席漢德森見此發展、乃宣佈休會至星期五日、庶使各代表有考慮大局之機會、（三十日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）法外長巴爾都演說雖已展期一日、未能於開幕之時宣佈、但猶不失其幸辣之味、彼對於西門氏之調解工作、及德國所堅持之地位、俱有猛烈之攻擊、實爲歐戰後第一年以來法國外交上至嚴厲至明顯之言論、巴爾都稱、法國堅忍不屈之態度、實至足欽佩、因法國今日猶不放棄其去年十月十四日之主張、决不任已解除武裝之國家重加武裝也、彼復背誦當日各國代表所發表之論調、並謂决不能因德國之脫離國聯、而遂各自變更其態度、但法國並不因其有四月十七日之通牒、而卽謂軍縮會議之門已闭、因軍縮會議之門、今日猶洞開如故云、巴氏繼復詳細評判德國之軍備預瘧算、謂數字上已足證明德國實已開始增加軍備云、至於保障一事、巴氏稱、彼並不完全贊成李維諾夫之主張、但李氏之張已指示一保障問題進展之途徑云、（卅日國民電）</p>

<p>（柏林）柏林報紙形容日内瓦之局勢、稱巴爾都與李維諾夫如唱雙簧、而英法之大打出手、不增無减、大多數德報對此均作壁上觀、僅將李維諾夫與巴爾都舌戰羣儒之演說、大書特書、咸認巴爾都多言自敗云、（三十一日國民電）</p>

<p>（柏林）日昨蘇俄外委李維諾夫在日内瓦所發表之言論、對於德國頗有旁敲側擊之意、但此處報紙對此顯然視爲無足輕重、柏林波森報今日發表意見、謂「俄法新婚之後、李維諾夫竟於其蜜月期中、自以爲其演說中大可對於德國加以直接間接之攻擊及中傷、但此種行徑絶不能引起吾人之驚訝、因如蘇俄國家之代表、固無資格譴責德國、指爲世界禍亂之中心、因今日三尺童子俱知莫斯科卽爲微菌製造廠之所在地、全球今猶受其傳染毒害也、今日共產之禍已波及無數國家、而如何防止此種禍患、希特勒已有相當之表演云（三十日國民電）</p>

<p>（日内瓦）昨日軍縮大會總委員會席上、自漢德森及台維斯演說後、卽有蘇聯外交人民委員長發表演說、李氏該項演說根據於下述之事實、卽軍縮問題以大會所表現之紛歧意見、已無和洽餘地、故已不能解决、李氏申述各種意見之主要差别時聲稱、「夫兩種極端不同之傾向自始卽已表露、其一卽爲蘇聯代表團所代表者、其二實際上乃爲其他各代表團所主張、蘇聯代表團不願視裁軍爲獨立而自足之問题、而徒以此滿足預算·經濟·宣傳等等之目的、</p>

<p>丨答王强·李桂生·阿四·小黑子四名丨</p>
<p>近來我們收到了四封出乎我們意外的來信。寫信的主人，一個是販賣小報，一個是輪船上的水手、還有兩個，一是私人家裏的汽車夫，一爲電車上賣票的。根據他們誠懇的來信，都是本欄的愛讀者，他們吿訴我，他們共同的生活條件都使他們對讀書問答表示不甚滿意。因爲讀書問答的對象明明把他們這種生活條件的人看落了。他們没有較固定的生活，不能有一個較長的讀書的計劃，不僅如此，他們甚至不能有繼續讀完一本五百面厚的書的條件。但他們還靑年，還要求智識。他們又說，他們的環境實在太壞了，太流動了，他們不知如何是好。雖然他們對於當前的生活不免要引起懷疑，焦極，但他們並未絶望，要求我們替他們解答，要求（讀書問答）注意流動性的人的讀書問題。我們讀完他們四通來信之餘，不禁萬分漸愧，不用說，我們是非常同情他們的。</p>
<p>我們决定（讀書問答）内，今後應注意討論這些人提出的問題，本篇就作爲討論的發端罷！</p>
<p>生活過於流動的人就不能好好的求知麽？不！决不！我們對於（讀書）二字的解釋，不應離開了各人的環境，專在這二字的抽象上弄虚玄。說（讀書）是應具備如何的條件，（讀書）會有如何如何的益處。這種靜態的觀察者的言論，祇配在大學講壇上，太太們的會客室的沙發上作（閑談）（茶話）的資料，對於缺乏相當條件的人，不獨無用，而且有使（英雄氣短）的。我們的所講的（讀書），不是空言（讀書），而是在某種生活條件下的（讀書），是具體的提出的（讀書），不是離開了個人實踐的生活的（讀書）。苟如此，則在任何生活條件下，都可具體的提出（讀書）問題來，都有（讀書）的可能。譬如以上四君都是生活最不安定的人，但不安定就不可讀書麽？這是被靜態的看法所誤解。販報，輪船上作水手，私家汽車夫，電車上賣票都不是完全没有閑暇時間的。至於生活太流動，太糟雜，不能有一顆安閑的心，所以不適宜於讀書，那也是形式的看法。有些人没有淸靜的地方不能讀書，没有長久的時間不肯讀書，這都是錯誤。須知目下的社會生活就不能使你有安靜的生活，安定的生活。你路等待那種條件，無異等候（天降麵包），你只會有失敗。就輪船上的水手的環境說，第一你須馬上養成不怕鬧的習慣，儘管人聲哄哄，我還能安之若素，船到了某一碼頭，更可安心大讀特讀一兩天，並且船上的客人中正有不少是有學問的人，你果眞用功，不恥下問，誰不歡喜指敎你呢？你何嘗無讀書條件！再說私家汽車夫罷！你除送主人上公事房或跳舞塲外，你的車子總是一憇就是好幾點鐘的，你不是閑得很嗎？當你車子停在街心時，你不要倾耳去聽舞塲的爵士音樂，你正可從坐椅墊下，倫倫地拏出你要讀的害來，靜心的去讀它。其他的兩種職業的月友，自然，在他的生活中仍算有可能讀書的條件的。至於不能作出長久的計劃，何妨改短些，一年太長了，能作三個月。不能讀完四五百面的大書，何妨改用一二百面的小書呢？你一切應該按照你的生活的實踐，可能的去運用，不要拏環境去遷就書，要拏讀書去遷就環境。有一位朋友對我說，爲了要讀書，預備辭去他的職業，這完全是錯誤的，這是不了解生活的邏輯。我們對於當前的困難，不僅就讀書說，都不應所消極的態度，明明目前無讀書的條件，我們郤應儘可能利用，奸那怕每天只有半點鐘，我就利用半點鐘，連半點鐘都没有，我就從寢食的時間去省出二三十分鐘來，我們應創造讀書的條件，我們應收不利於我們的條件轉變爲利於我們的條件，把目前壞的環境，轉變到一種新的較善的階段去。我們的生活邏輯是繼續不斷的創造，不是停留在某一階段，看了没有辦法，停着脚步嘆氣。拿破侖說過，他的字典中没有難字。他是讀得生活邏輯的人。世間上眞正可稱得痛快的事，是克服困難後獲得的成功，不是享先人生的人，是永不停留在障碍前的，他敢於面見困難，不怕失敗。讀書能成功的人，幾乎不是有一切安閑條件的人，而是經過許多險阻難難，一步一步達到的。</p>
<p>因此，我們想到，有許多讀者對我們所作的讀書報吿上面去了。他們每每以當前的困難，作爲自己不前進的辯護，這是很可惜的。他們每每誇大困難，形式的來高談讀書，把讀書與自己的生活分離。這些都是對於讀書的有害的觀念，不得不趕快的除去！</p>
<p>我們讀書指導部，不向不曾提出抽象的（讀書），卽本欄所發表的讀書方法各篇文字，一向的意思是當作大家的參考的，不是要讀者死扳的應用。譬如我屢次的替讀者開出的各科研究的書目，我們並不是要大家都照那樣去做讀者應按自己的生活環境，溶化我們的指導，去攝所自己需要的部份。我們對於每一個來要求讀書指導的人，答案也每每互異，因爲各人生活條件不同，實不應機械的規定一條公式的。</p>
<p>我們不能等待好的條件會從天上掉下，不要在困難前退却，我們希望四君趕快决定最低最短時間的讀書計劃，再和我們作進一步的討論。</p>
<p>最後，我們敢於向大家說，智識是應在隨時隨地一點一滴的去擁取的。只要你不拒絶智識，不僅在書本中，社會的各方面都是你吸取的原料。</p>

<p>出席遠東運動會之敎部體育督學郝更生、於二十九日回京據談此次遠東運動會關於競技方面、勝負問題事小、關於日本陰謀（欲僞國加入）我國力謀應付事大、故我國代表責任綦重、我國代表及選手、到港到菲極受僑胞歡迎、以比賽成績論、除足球與女游泳外、餘多不及、但觀此次各個人之盡力去做、較前已見很大的進步、例如棒球我國平時向少注意預計不堪與試、但結果僅四與一及四與零之小負、排球居然有一次勝菲他如籃球網球田徑賽等等、雖多失敗、但分數相差、尙不過多、於此可見年來我人體育有顯著之進步、就修改會　言、我代表據理力爭義正辭嚴日人無所施其技、菲爲其所誘、主張除大會另組一特别小委員會、由中日菲三國各推、人爲委員、卽由大會將修章事移交此委會討論、我方慷慨陳詞、日人無法在此會將僞國提出、我代表不同意修章仍將大會移案退還大會、大會日主早開、我恐因此問題、影響本屆運動會、遂遲至十九才開、大會時日因第三條辦不通、於第十條弄花樣、（團體參加表演）及十四條附則所謂三分之二者、曲爲解釋、中國取五單位作正式解釋、菲有袒偏、欲爲日表决、中國認爲非法、卽退席、日幾條路都走不通、乃出於誘菲非法解散大會、解散之後、美菲兩國、與論沸騰、大不理理衆口、菲亦感覺不安、當我代表及選手歸國時、菲參議院長奎生（任遠東運動會一九三四至一九三五年會長）與我國王正廷博士、作一度談話、對於遠東會事云、當力圖補救、我國將來視其辦法如何、再作計議、至、向世界運動會說明一節、前次中國送選手劉長春赴世界運動會時、該會對僞國向不承認、早已成竹在胸、此次非法解散遠運會、更足以暴見其短耳、郝對此次出席之感想、（一）覺得比賽成績、雖有許多不若人、但各國人都能盡力去做已較前進步許多、（二）人家進步較多、我進步較少、因此剌激發奮努力可爲將來較多之進步、（三）日人蠻橫無理不足談、而奮鬭精神可取、例如足球、一向甚差、此次雖負、但有兩次與我爲三與三及四與四之比、又排球不行、亦能勝菲一次、於此可見其平時努力、我國可爲參考、（四）國内體育上要做的事甚多、宜脚踏實地、自强不息、努力去奮鬭、以便將來遇相當環境、隨時可表現眞正的整個的精神、至遠東會固爲表現體育之地、但體育本身、只要鍜鍊、自可有所表現、遠東會爲另一問題、不必因噎而廢食也、</p>

<h3 id="c252">御香縹緲錄 <a href="#c252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>關於本書的聲明</p>
<p>春秋在四月初大革新之後，卽加刊不佞所譯的「御香縹緲錄」小說一種。當時已預先聲明，我們登載這篇小說的意思，並不是要考證前朝遺事，不過是想藉以調劑讀者的興趣而已。其後作者德齡之妹容齡郡主爲本刊所寫的一篇序，以及不佞寫的一段「介紹原著者」裏面，又復一再聲明，此書所述，並非盡屬信史，讀者祇能欣賞它的美妙的煊染，和生動的文字，不能就把它看做淸廷的實事。因爲我們知道，小說是和歷史，演義，傳記，絶對不同的；其中儘多作者杜撰的空中樓阁，藉以凑合書中的關節，而取悅讀者。當然不僅「御香縹緲錄」如此！</p>
<p>近有人對於本書内容，加以頗詳盡的指正；從考證前朝遺事的立塲上看來，這種態度是對的。不過這是一篇小說，那就又當别論了。</p>
<p>春秋發表這篇小說，有三個用意：</p>
<p>（一）德齡以前曾寫過一部「淸宫二年紀」，譯成國文後，很受讀者稱賞，可算是一個中國前輩的女作家。在女作家尙不多見的中國，對於伊的作品，我們似乎應該盡量介紹。</p>
<p>（二）文中雖然很有許多形容過火的地方，但興味實在也不少，而且把慈禧的個性寫得十分透澈，總不失爲一篇好小說。</p>
<p>（三）全書雖分三十五節，但每節都可拆開，等於二十五篇短篇小說；這種章法，對於我們日報，比較相宜一些。</p>
<p>我們爲增加讀者興趣起見，待全書刊完後將請容齡郡主和勛齡先生詳詳細細的寫一篇考證淸廷遺事的文章，像做一份淸算賬一樣。現在讀者如有疑惑，不妨一一記下，到那時再和這考證逐條比對，豈不是分外有趣嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c253">改良種楊餘聲 <a href="#c253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— 楊餘聲</p>
<p>說是爲了農村經濟完全破產的緣故，鄕間蠶事剛正開始的時候，無力購買改良蠶種的蠶户是很多的。他們雖很明瞭歷年襲用「土種」的結果是白白勞碌一塲，但因爲土種用不到化錢去買，在經濟萬分困難的時候，就是爲數不多的蠶種費用，也得劃算一下，眞是窮得可憐！據說，土種蛻化出來的蠶，大都貪吃懶做。在頭眠二眠三眠三個時期中，桑葉「報銷」得着實不少。有些剛到三眠，蠶身發黑，化成一堆臭水，這固然一半是受到天時的影響，但蠶種本身的不健全，没有抵抗能力，實屬無可諱言。有些在三眠中雖有良好的現象，但臨上蠶簇就似乎不願「作繭自縛」，昻着頭現出滿不高興的神氣。蠶户遇到這種貪吃懶做的東西，眞是旣恨且急，大都把它摔到地上，一羣母鷄就五吿分屍地將它收拾去了！</p>
<p>改良種就不是這樣。它曾經過一番鍜鍊的手續，貪吃懶做蠶種，是經不起這種鍜鍊的，所以悉在淘汰之列，因此它們也就不能出來害人！改良種旣能熬過一番鍜鍊，蠶種的本身當然來得健全。它們具有抵抗天時所襲來的「惡化」「腐化」的能力，經得起「風浪」，所以對於人類的貢獻也就特佳。雖說它們有時也會受到無法抵抗的災害，重貽蠶户之憂，但像「土種」那般「未熟先死」，貪吃懶做的敗兆，是很少發現的。所以改良種做成的絲繭，市價比「土種」的高得多。而後者大半的命運，縱能逃於鷄羣的饞吻，大都抛入「灰塘」，變作肥料。這倒是廢物利用之一法！</p>

<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>我家石湖，在蘇州，也稱得一個好去處，妙在離城不遠，就是弱不禁風緩如牛步的畫舫，也不消一小時可以到行春橋畔了。尤其是沿着横塘，一路是靑的山，綠的水，比七里山塘，更顯出天然美來。</p>
<p>行春橋接連着九環洞橋，彷佛石湖的門帘，掀開門帘，波平如鏡，風软如酥的石湖。整個的供獻到眼前了。中間一個被稱爲湖心亭遺址的小渚，周匝着菰蒲，令人想起了西湖裏的阮公墩。左面吳子深畫家所經營的漁郎村，黑垣粉廊，和右面海潮寺殘餘的黃牆碧草，顏色調和得古樸可喜。登上治平寺的湖山堂，喝一杯茶，走入茂密的少林，聽一回泉，瞻仰上方山的孤塔，遊目騁懷了一刻兒，覺得這不甚費力而可以得到登臨之樂心耳之娛的環境，老是給迷信的空氣籠罩着，十分可惜。假使築一條車路，　　　，　　　　　，蓋　　小屋，種些紅桃綠柳，放幾個瓜皮艇子在湖上盪漾着，不是一個很好的石湖公園麽？似乎王引才長蘇州市的時候，曾經有過這話頭，可是蘇州人什麽都不高興，尤其是潤飾湖山，認爲不急之務呢。其實蘇州人在急務上，也何嘗努力呢。</p>
<p>這一帶的山林寺觀，李印泉先生是常到的，所以他留題的文字很多。治平寺裏有許多石塊，都題字在上面，可說是好事者了。據導遊人說，到了八月中秋以後，四方來進香的很多，山下人家都靠他得到一點沾潤澆裏。可惜這山上的和尙，不及杭州和尙的手段高妙，否則何難大興土木，把山林裝點得簇簇生新，楚楚可觀呢。</p>

<p>第二十九回</p>
<p>回柬足傷心自標獨活</p>
<p>聽　同歃血共誓精忠</p>
<p>寳芳點點頭，也没有加批評，正說着呢，忽然一陣軋軋之聲，臨到了頭上，抬頭看時，正是兩架敵人的飛機，大兜着圈子來了。它的目的，是不是注意着這平安寨堡裏，那很難說，不過敵機旣然臨到了頭上，人總當閃避開來，免得做了人家的目標，所以寳芳向自强一作手勢，各人都避到屋子裏去了。過了許久，也没有什麽動靜，那軋軋之聲，已經遠颺了，自强出來時，見殷得仁早在外面了。他見着人，表示那淡淡的一笑，將肩膀抬了幾下。他雖是没有作聲，好像在那裏說，這又算得了什麽。同時見他兩手捧了許多紅綠紙的傳單，還不住用眼光向四下裏張望着，打算還要找幾張傳單似的。自强道：是飛機上扔下來的嗎？上面說些什麽，讓我瞧瞧。殷得仁笑道：這還用得瞧嗎？呌一名伙夫來，也可以猜得出這上面說得是些什麽。瞧了這個，無非是徒亂人心，我們就别跟弟兄們找這條路子了。說着，他將那些傳單捲着一處，按在地面上，然後擦了一根火柴，將那傳單點着，不多會子，就化成了一陣靑烟了。自强笑道：二哥，你這人精明强幹，處處我不如你。殷得仁笑道：你佩服我的原因，我也明白，就是爲了你要了媳婦以後，覺得我這光桿太舒服了。自强歎了一口氣道：舒服不舒服呢，當軍人的，不過如此，只是我這精神上受的痛苦，簡直嘴裏没法兒說出來，這是你要光幹兒的人所没有的事。殷得仁道：嗐！到現在你還念着家啦。憑你這個樣子，怎樣去帶你那一連弟兄？（三九七）</p>

<h3 id="c257">貓話 <a href="#c257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— 朱𦐂</p>
<p>在「馬牛羊，鷄犬豕」外，貓確也是家畜中的重要動物：江南人家，差不多家家都畜着貓。貓不但僵捕捉老鼠，使那跳梁小醜，不敢在黑暗勢力籠罩下面，出來竊食毀物，騷擾居人：並且那柔和的性格，悅目的皮毛，也怪惹人憐愛。以前閨中女郎，十之七八，都愛着貓。我記得那時，曾瞧見張曼陀畫的美女月份牌，璇閨一角間在熊熊吐燄的壁爐面前，一個時裝女郎，用絨繩逗着　隻小貓戲玩：那幽靜的景物，不由人瞧着不發生戀戀的情惑！現在時代逐漸遞變，女郎的性情，也隨着時代的輪齒，由幽靜而趨重活躍，於是貓是失寵了，而變做時代落伍的動物。摩登小姐的懷抱裏或脚跟前，是跟着那其毛蓬鬆的洋種小狗。　　然而貓畢竟是可愛的動物，光滑的皮毛，是那麽柔軟可愛貓的品格，有些像虎，頭部須圓，頷部須阔，全身毛片，虎虎有力，尤其那條尾巴，能常常竪起，那是力能捕鼠的好貓。假使頷部狹小，貓的嘴尖尖拱起，定是倫食貓兒。如尾巴常常夾在臀部中間，不是有病，定是怕冷無力的　貓，秋貓，都不是好的貓。</p>
<p>貓的種類，以春天產生的最好：那時繭蠶剛孵化，所以呼做「早蠶貓」。那種貓，因在冬季交配，經過風雪，所以體力堅强，耐寒忍苦。至於那種夏季或秋季產生的貓，到了冬天，就成日煨在竈膛裏面，非要熊熊的火为把，塞進竈門，才像赤壁被困的曹阿瞞，冒火奪圍，是終日高臥在稻草灰裏，不肯出頭的。</p>
<p>貓的形態，大約可分兩種：一種是獅子貓，那種貓因細毛蓬鬆，彷佛像獅子一般，形狀是很可愛的：不過毛，旣蓬鬆分披，自然容易藏垢納汚，蓄養的人，非殷勤愛護，着意整理，是不容易美麗淸潔的。還有一種，就是普通的貓了。那種貓因毛的顏色不同，又可分成幾種名稱。背上全黑，脚腹雪白，呌做「烏雲蓋雪」：混身白色，尾巴獨黑的，呌做「雪裏拖槍」：此外還有「鐵棒打櫻桃」，那是貓額上有着黃色或黑色的圓點的。最普通的，是玳瑁和花狸貓了。</p>
<p>貓以雌雄爲貴，因爲雌貓發性時季，一年中祇有幾天，是不肯安分的，平日總是貞操自守，靜處家中，不像雄貓成年價騷性大發，一味追求，除了沿路小便，還要爭風惹禍，連捕鼠的正當工作，都無心去兼幹！所以俗語說得好：「雌狗雄貓，送人不要」，惟，確是不受人歡迎的東西，貓狗就是一個明顯的例子！</p>
<p>貓的眼睛，是能黑夜見物的，所以在黑暗裏面，也能捕捉鼠子。那兩隻眼睛，在黑暗中瞧去，綠油油的好像兩顆明星。有的貓的眼睛，在黑暗裏瞧去，一紅一綠，彷佛金銀兩星，這呌做「金銀眼」，是很能捕鼠的。貓的眼珠，最爲奇異，是隨着辰光變動的；在午夜和中午時候，好像一條銀綫，以後逐漸放圓，由綫條而變成梭子，由梭子而變成混圓，彷彿是一隻天然時計。珍寳中有一種「貓兒眼」，據說也能表示時光，是一種無價的寳物。</p>
<p>貓是捕鼠的肉食獸，所以它拌飯的食物，也以魚爲要品。貓吃飯的時間，大槪是在中午時候，因爲夜裏要貓捕捉老鼠，假使喂飽了，它就不肯捕食老鼠了。所以俗諺有「朝喂貓，夜喂狗」的一句話。貓的年齡，大約可活五六齡至七八齡，在小貓誔生後一個星期，可喂給糖飯，半月之後，就可呼、吃普通飯了。在小貓剛吃飯的時候，拌些油條（一名油炸燴，是一種油煎的麵食）在内，可免小貓生病；在現在獸醫學尙未研究完善的時代，貓生病時的藥物，祇有賣些烏藥，磨汁灌給它吃，算是唯一療治貓病的方法了。</p>

<p>— 殊</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>李日華日記，我所藏所見的，共有三種本子。最初買到的，是「嘯　叢書」李含　（日華曾孫）的節抄本；前有片石居主人，李肇亨，（日華子）李含　的序，後有轉熊，葛元煦的跋。其後買到的，是吳興劉氏嘉業堂刻印的全稿，除李肇亨一序外，復有晚聞居士與劉承幹的跋，劉跋述得此抄本之經過甚詳。節本錄一百五十五條，約當全書八分之二弱。去年，又看到明刻「李竹嬾先生說部」一書，内收日記三種：「璽召錄」「禮白嶽記」，與「薊旋錄」。其間，「禮白嶽記」一種，校閱結果，係從全稿中抽出，爲萬歷四十二年四月五日至五月二十九日全稿。「璽召」「薊旋」二錄，則一作於天啓五年；一作於嘉業堂本全稿後，然均無特著優點。日記内容，「起萬歷已酉迄丙辰，卷以年分。所載皆　校詩文，品隲書畫，旁涉山川云物，草木杯茗」（片石居主人），文字簡鍊頗有韻致，在日記文學中，是一部好書。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>讀古人的生活日記，最主要的當然是關於作者生活的了解。「明自神宗季年，廷臣結黨，互相攻訐，日華獨潔身引退，奉親讀書，　然埃𡏖之外，若有以自得」（劉跋），所以他的日記反映的生活，是特殊具有隠逸風的。他歡喜遨遊山水，如「十一日，賀孝延，岳季有具湖舫招余，泊烟雨樓。時河冰片段觸舟，夕陽射之如碎玉，岸柳千樹，寒條刺天，遊者絶迹。余以爲淸虚洞朗，無踰此時者，勝春江夜月多矣」，卽是一例，而白嶽，齊云兩遊，尤足想見他的趣尙。他歡喜藝花，日記涉及此一方面的，如一每披讀倦，卽曳杖行諸卉間，曲折盤辟，甚有意趣，從此樹陰竹色鳥語花香，似此偏饒也」。如「同沈倩戴生亨兒小酌花下，時綘桃七八樹，如坐霞幔中，二鶴翩翩雪羽映其間，風景良絶，沈倩文思驟進爲之滿引，具足想見」。園林山水，是李日華最高的生活意趣，因此遊覽山水，欣賞花卉之外，他也用很多的力量，從事於庭園的佈置，買一卵石五萬有奇」甃地，買一石四十枚，大者如蹲獅，小者如伏狸」，來裝點「山　氣味」，不憚勞的「與匠氏量審繩墨，圬者較度高卑豐褊」。飲食一方面，也特别的考究，如喝水，「惠山載水人回，得新泉二十餘甕，前五日，昭度云山老僧寄余火前新芽一瓶，至是開試，色香味俱絶」。如食物：「沈倩伯遠餉黃雀四十頭，肥白鮮脆，得味之蚤者，夜飲，爲傾二缶，」在他的日記裏，我們簡直可以整理出一張他嗜好集中的飲、食單。沈　水向李日華說：「余至是且將盡焚于祿書，閉門灌竹，令生意鬰然不斷，日攤稗官雜說其下，縱酒笑歌」。李日華的個人生活，實際上就是這樣。一個退隠的貴族，一個有錢的文士，靠着他的錢財與詩書畫的特殊技能，逃避「塵囂」，快樂的度過了一生。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>「味冰軒日記」關於學術方面的紀載，主要的是論畫，以及繪畫題跋詩詞的抄記，所佔的數量，約超過全書的二之一。如「二十二日。偕萬　鄕的藏陸叔平大幅灌菊圖。山稜　峭，樹木疏朗，大槪用子久法。草堂踞平岡，籬薄環遶，樹有行列。隔水有閣，虚敝可望。二童擔水行灌，一童濱澗挹水注器中，二老跌坐堂前，一拊琴，一抱膝，極有神會。後山遙峯下，一亭聳然，石　籬脚。用五色小點攢簇爲寒葩，晃晃若夕陽映其光，輕風拂其態也。欵云，壬申九日包山陸治作於餐英館中」。這一類記畫的文字，是李日華最擅勝長的，細緻，簡鍊，且極生動。此外則爲書，在日記中，値得我們注意的。是介紹了幾本閒書，以及幾部小品傑作，雖然對於閒書，他也並不完全高興。他讀過「金瓶梅」，評語是：「大抵市餫之極穢者，而鋒燄遠遜水滸傳，袁中郎極口贊之，亦她奇之過」。他不但對中郎之贊「金瓶梅」表示不滿，對於公安一派的文學，也和其師陳眉公一樣，不以爲然，此於日記中也可看到：「二日，雨。讀徐文長集，袁中郎宏道表章之，以爲當代一人。然其人肮髒有奇氣，而不雅馴，若詩則俚而詭激，絶似中郎，是以有臭味之合耳，雜劇四聲猿却是妙手。他讀過「燈花婆婆」，讀過「笑笑錄」，對於「笑笑錄」的意見是：「雖市昔穢雜之语，經其挑撥，極有奇趣，一叙亦詼諢可喜」，且將原序抄錄。此外，還說到「仙遊」，「夢遊」，「傲遊」三書，引友人顧渚的意見謂：「近日所刻異書，有夢遊仙遊二錄，非詞非傳奇，乃　媪彈琵調也而有深致。相傳爲楊廉夫避地江南時所作，尙有俠遊錄未見。顧渚又言，我明事事俱落古人後，其超絶者，茶酒墨與打棗歌而已」，此正是當時正人君子的一般見解。日記中有一事，所載殊奇，卽是說：陸放翁還著有「出蜀記」一種，且較（入蜀記）爲佳，不如是眞是假，蓋據我所知，放翁實無此作也。</p>
<h3 id="c279">論秦理齋夫人事 <a href="#c279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— 公汗</p>
<p>這幾年來，報章上常見有因經濟的壓迫，禮敎的制裁而自殺的記事，但爲了這些，便來開口或動筆的人是很少的。只有新近秦理齋夫人及其子女一家四口的自殺，却是過不少的回聲，後來還出了一個懷着這一段新聞記事的自殺者，更可見其影響之大了。我想，這是因爲人數多。單獨的自殺，蓋已不足以招大家的靑睞了。</p>
<p>一切回聲中，對於這自殺的主謀者一一秦夫人，雖然也加以恕辭，但歸結却無非是誅伐。因爲丨丨評論家說丨丨社會雖然黑暗，但人生的第一責任是生存，倘自殺，便是失職，第二責任是受苦，倘自殺，便是偷安。進步的評論家則說人生是戰鬭，自殺者就是逃兵，雖死也不足以蔽其罪。這自然也說得下去的，然而未免太籠統。</p>
<p>人間有犯罪學者，一派說，由於環境；一派說，由於個人。現在盛行的是後一說，因爲倘信前一派，則消滅罪犯，便得改造環境，事情就麻煩，可怕了。而秦夫人自殺的批判者，則是大抵屬於後一派者。</p>
<p>誠然，旣然自殺了，這就證明了她是一個弱者。但是，怎麽會弱的呢？要緊的是我們須看看她的尊翁的信札，爲了要她回去，旣聳之以兩家的名聲，又動之以亡人的乩語。我們還得看看她的令弟的輓聯：『妻殉夫，子殉母……』不是大有視爲千古美談之意嗎？以生長及陶冶在這樣的家庭中的人，又怎麽能不成爲弱者？我們固然未始不可責以奮鬭，但黑暗的吞噬之力，往往勝於孤軍，况且自殺的批判者未必就是戰鬭的應援者，當他人奮鬭時，掙扎時，敗績時，也許倒是鴉雀無聲了。窮鄕僻壤或都會中，孤兒寡婦，貧女勞人之順命而死，或雖然抗命，而終於不得不死者何限，但曾經上誰的口，動誰的心呢？眞是『自經於溝凟而莫之知也』！</p>
<p>人固然應該生存，但爲的是進化；也不妨受苦，但爲的是解除將來的一切苦；更應該戰鬭，但爲的是改革。責别人的自殺者，一面責人，一面正也應該向驅人於自殺之途的環境挑戰進攻。</p>

<p>— 元</p>
<p>理齋夫人偕其子妇服藥同殉後，料老友平甫，經此家庭　變，悲痛必非尋常，屢思有以勸慰之；然又懼益傷老人心，遲未敢往。近有友人，自錫來述平甫近狀，謂悲痛已稍殺矣，日來尙能勉强見客；時館中當局，亦以理齋夫婦等窀穸爲念，擬以所允貼補丹若學費，移爲補助安葬用，欲與老人一商。余承此使命，遂於二十六日下午一時，乘特快車往，四時到錫。至則見城外人山人海，異而詢之，始知適逢赛會，且將繼之以夜，附近數十里，空巷來觀。又詢賽會之故，則云：（明末倭寇肆擾時，無錫知縣有王其勤者，慮寇來錫搶掠，急督工役，趕築錫城，工甫竣而寇大至，率地方守衛軍民禦之，初次敗退，死三十六人，繼復集衆戰於郊外，倭寇大敗，全城賴以保全。由是邑人德之，歲歲出會以資紀念。今年因日本侵略野心益肆，锡人鬰忿的積，藉圖發洩，故格外盛大耳。）余素畏囂，訪友又恐路阻，遂在無錫飯店六十六號早睡。</p>
<p>翌晨八鐘，先到蓉湖莊九豐麵粉廠，訪蔡松如君，則悉已於昨日往滬，時機相左，甚懊喪。繼卽赴裏城脚平甫君之外宅，見平甫之如夫人，云平甫因男小孩出痧後病變，甚危險，早卽出外謀醫藥去矣。（平甫如夫人生一男一女，男九歲，女十一歲。）余爲一驚，念平甫何不幸乃爾？遂卽辭出，赴小婁巷老宅，先晤秦效魯（毓鎏）君。效魯爲平甫堂弟，亦余舊友也。不暇寒暄，急問平甫之小世兄，病狀若何，效魯曰：徼天之幸，今晨已出險矣，前兩日因痧後𤍠勢不退，中醫束手，昨易西醫，服藥後至晚　𤍠勢退，今已無妨矣。心乃稍安。繼問理齋夫人之事，原因果盡如報紙所說乎？效魯曰：除報紙所說夫婦情篤與姑不和兩點外，余亦絶未知有其他原因也。且所謂與姑不和，前亦未之聞。理齋結婚，尚在就學時代，一家團聚，雍容和睦。我秦氏族中，莫不欣羨平甫家庭之美滿快樂。其後理齋赴滬就事，余姪媳尹霞，旋亦往滬，近數年每得滬訊，皆稱理齋夫婦賢能刻苦，能自立，且時供甘旨費於兩老，故余初未知其姑媳間有違言也。迨尹霞死。報上發表平甫信，始以問平甫，平甫曰：「表面固姑慈婦孝，至隠微間，我亦難言之矣。」余所知僅此。效魯又言，余嫂（平甫夫人）近已山漢返錫，兩女與兩壻伴回。理齋尹霞等死耗，初均瞞嫂，及返，始吿以理齋死。余嫂卒然曰：理齋死，余媳尹霞必死矣！余素知兩人性情；媳若死，理齋必死；理齋死，媳亦不獨生。究如何？勿瞞我！乃吿以尹霞果死矣，則又頓足曰：希端玨亦必死矣，孫輩性情，與其父母同也。乃盡吿之，其時余嫂之悲愴跳躍，慘狀不忍再述。幸其女與壻及家人，極力勸慰，今猶在譬解防範之中。余心殊詫平甫夫人，何其知兒媳性情之獨深也。時平甫兩壻，一龔一李出見余，皆温雅而幹練，我友老懷，當亦可稍慰乎？談次，平甫聞訊至，氣喘聲唖，相對幾不成一語。效魯代余述來意，並漸及理齋夫人死事，平甫曰：　哉！余初無必欲迫媳返錫意也，第因親戚咸言：孤兒寡婦，流居滬上，一無照應，心何能安？余亦正慮及此，乃招这返。而孰料其竟至於此？（聞平甫在理齋夫婦及孫靈前，除製兩輓聯懸掛外，尙有兩額，一曰「天乎何罪」，一曰「何至於此」·同具有懷莫白之意）。言已潸然出涕。余不敢再有所問。最後，余述館中當局意，問墳地有否？今年能安葬否？效魯顧謂平甫曰：異哉，昨晚余夢理齋與尹謹及希端珏團坐一桌，似有所議，兄（指平甫）似亦與於其列，余訝其不知所議何事，今默公來，言及此，莫非卽爲此事耶？平甫：須速了此，以安死者之心。又言：我秦氏歷代成例，凡子女年未滿二十而殤者，不得附葬於昭穆之次，今次似不能拘於成例；蓋理齋夫婦，必欲其子女同居一處也。平甫曰：然，余先人墳墓，已無餘穴可葬，余自身卽須另覔墳地，合之理齋夫婦及孫輩，必須有七八具之廣地，則一時難覔耳。效魯曰：秦氏老墳，均在惠山，惟現在惠山價貴，且無隙地可尋，余意稍遠亦無妨，如　頭渚等處，價賤而又易覔，俟稍暇，余當助汝覔之。平甫曰：余於今冬，必了此事。</p>
<p>時已午刻，效魯曰：晋華今日適返錫，余已邀來共談；迨使者返報，謂已往惠山矣。乃卽在效魯處午餐，同席者，余與效魯平甫，及效魯之一壻，平甫之兩壻也。餐畢，效魯曰：君難得來，余亦伏居久，正思出外一遊，平甫鬰悶甚，請君陪同一遊，藉以抒散其心，可乎？余不敢却，乃僱汽車，先至梅園，在誦　堂啜茗，徘徊良久。又上太湖飯店，憑欄眺望多時，風景固甚佳，然我人今日絶無游興，且因時間已晚，不進往　頭渚，卽折回無錫飯店，坐談片刻，平甫效魯握别去，余在寓稍息，至八點二十分，卽赴車站，乘特快車返滬。臨行時，晋華先生遺使邀宴，余因急於上車，却之，頗爲歉仄云。</p>
<p>余在車中，默念：秦氏家庭，爲一融融洩洩之家庭，尹霞之翁姑，亦非尋常蠻不講理者可比，經濟又不發生問題，而尹霞竟如此死！竟率兒女如此從容死！其死果如一般同情者之言，爲難能耶？抑如批評者之言，爲可不必耶？此問題徘徊於腦際，至車輪轆轆聲停，而余之懷疑猶未釋也。</p>

<p>同樣地，阿梅帶了探求而戰慄的心去接獨這個强壯而粗暴的，日間把所有勞力放在田裏，夜間回來便呼呼大睡的男人。</p>
<p>「爲什麽要怕我呢？現在，我是你底丈夫呀」。阿漢帶了原始的彎橫和不習慣的温存，這樣對阿梅說了。然而她在這陌生而强頑的男人面前，更顯得呆笨起來，當丈夫猛力而𤍠烈地擁抱她的時候，她哭泣了。</p>
<p>「喂！你不是小孩子咯，幹嗎要哭呢？啊，有些什麽使你不舒服麽」？男人低下頭來，歛着呼吸小聲問。</p>

<p>— 楨</p>
<p>本刊上載有履冰先生爲（電報貧民化）一文以根據電報營業統計，官軍電幾佔百分之七十以上，工商電報百分之二十，其餘私人所發電報，不滿百分之十，推論現今電報帶有貴族色彩，而爲我國電信事業，不能發達之原因，立論允當。顧官軍電報擁擠，實由於軍事工作之緊張，徵調頻煩，軍書旁午，惟電報是賴，一俟政治修明軍事吿终之時，官電自然减少。電政機關感受切身痛苦者，不在官電之繁多，而在官電之多而不付費是也。</p>
<p>我國電政，雖云國家經營，但並未得國庫補助，故其營業方針，不得不取自給主義，純恃報費收入，以資挹注，至於綫路之維護，材料之購置，員工之薪水，行政之開支，在在均需鉅欵。在商電較多之時，尙能勉强支持，奈近年來國内經濟破產，百業蕭條，電報營業，隨而衰落，欠薪之局，十居八九，馴至不能維持現狀，苦况莫名，開源節流之道，在於整理官電欠费是已。</p>
<p>茲將十九，二十，二十一，三年份官電與商電之比較列表如次。</p>
<p>國内官商電報字數比較表</p>
<p>年份華文政務電報洋文（卽官電）十九年九六、四五○、六二四七八八，八一六二十年一０六、○五八、八○九七○三、○四三廿一年九九、四六二、三四九五九九、一二二　　由上表觀之，每年官電比商電多至一倍以上，數量旣有如此之鉅，且多冠以（特急）（限卽刻到）字樣，急如星火，例應提前發送，商電雖付現欵，不得不積壓在後，故當軍事緊張之時，商電屢有遲到之虞者，職是故耳。</p>
<p>查官電僅收半費，本已較商電爲廉，近因剿匪之故，對於軍電復有材料費之規定，每百字僅收五角，如能照章付現，則電局尙可稍資挹注，將綫路增修，機件改良，人手加多，善爲設備，則商電决無積壓之事，然揆諸事實，卽應付之幾角材料費亦多不付。根據電政統計，十九年份有綫電報收支總况賬而盈餘三百三十五萬四千餘元，而官電欠費達三百四十餘萬元。二十年份賬面盈餘四百九十二萬八千餘元，而官電欠費達四百八十五萬餘元。查自國民政府成立截至二十一年十二月止，官電欠費共達一千六百九十七萬七千餘元，去年欠费亦在三百萬元左右，吾人閱此數字的統計，當爲之驚心咋舌，而嘆電政之維持不易矣。</p>
<p>官電欠費之原因，約有數端：（一）由於歷年習慣者：前在軍閥政府時代，視電局爲稅收機關，局長多係其所委派，故軍隊發電永久記帳而已。卽或非其所派，然以聯絡軍閥感情，保存位置起見，官電欠費，不敢向之索取，任其自然。於是軍人認爲免費發電，爲應享之特權，而電局亦認爲軍人發電，有優待之先例。甚至軍隊藉口軍事緊急，强迫電局發電，不名一文，偶與理論，卽以（有誤戎機）相加者。此種惡習，由來者漸。（二）由於常私舞弊者：電局對於官電，前旣抱放任政策，不肖主管人員，乃藉此營私舞弊，或以多報少，或全數隠匿不報，或請求軍部給予私人津貼或私人差事，作爲免收電費之條件。又或電局與軍隊經手人員，夥同作弊，故意爲難，催收則上下其手，核算則朋比爲奸，鉅欵入於私囊，電費仍存公帳，電局有欠費之名，軍隊無省之實。現經交通部幾番澈查嚴予懲辦，此風稍戢。（三）由於發電機關經費困難者：年來軍事迭興，軍額龐大，國庫空虚，餉糈奇絀，以致各機關各部隊經費困難，未能將電費全數付淸，亦欠費原因之一。</p>
<p>電政經濟之拮据，全在官電之欠費，旣如上述，全數付現，則每年電政收入，至少增加二三百萬元，若以此鉅欵，建設新綫路，添置新機件，訓練幹部人才，整理電政資產，無不左右裕如，百廢具舉，如是則將現今報價繼續减低若干，以便利民衆，亦屬可能之事。若官電不能付現，則電政經費全係一般發電民衆所擔負，殊不合理，而積虧之餘，事實上必有使全國電政根本破產之一日，此不獨違反國民營事業之原則，仰且有背國民經濟之原理也。</p>
<p>交通部對於官軍電報，現極注意。一面力行官軍電報收費及限制辦法，以資取締，一面嚴行整頓官軍電報收費考核辦法，以昭懲勸，又一面查扣私事官電並追償報費，近年以來，頗有成績。前節所云强迫發電者，固不常見，營私舞弊者，亦不敢以身試法。今後政治漸上　軌道，軍事亦吿敉平，官電收現，或不難達到圓滿目的乎？</p>
<h3 id="c284">中日無綫電本日起直接通報矣！ <a href="#c284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— 淸華</p>
<p>交通部上海國際電臺自十八年一月成立以來，對於發展國際無綫電報業務，異常努力，故現在通報電路已有滬港，中菲，中荷，中美（交通公司及馬凱公司各一路），中德，中法，中瑞，中越，中俄，中英，等十一路，世界各國中，凡與我國有重要商務關係者，幾無不可以直達通報，不僅商民受通訊便利之益，卽我國營事業亦獲經濟上之大助。然吾人尙引以爲憾者，厥爲日本至今未與我國開放直達無綫電路，殊爲美中不足。蓋日本與我國往來電報，每年計有四五百萬字　佔我國國際電報中第一位置，現在該兩處電報幾完全由水綫傳遞。交部有見及此，已定自本日起開放中日無綫電路，從此中日間往來電報亦可由無綫電傳遞，我國國際無綫電報業務將更有長足之進展矣！</p>
<p>我國國内電報營業收入，因受工商業蕭條，共匪擾亂及省辦長途電話之影響，年來逐漸跌减，各電局幾有難於维持之勢，幸賴國際無綫電報近兩年來營業甚佳，故得挹彼注此，勉爲維持。今年一月分起，交部爲謀减低民衆負擔，發展業務起見，特將華文電報之收報入姓名住址减價收費，此項辦法實行後，預計每年須减少收入国四五十萬元，在此電政經濟竭蹶之時，自非速謀彌補不可。至彌補之法，目前國内電報旣無可發展，則唯一途徑，祇有積極發展國際無綫電報，以補國内電報收入之不足。中日電路之亟於開放者，此亦爲重大原因之一也！</p>
<p>中日往來電報各處價目不同，茲爲讀者易於明瞭起見，特列表如後：</p>
<p>往來地點每字總價中國本綫費日本本綫費水綫費備註上海與日本七十五生丁二十生丁二十生西下三十五生丁靑島與日本一法郎二十五生丁二十五生丁五十生丁靑佐水綫經轉爲限其他各處與日本一法郎二十五生丁五十生丁二十五生丁五十生丁　　上表所列之水綫費，除靑佐水綫費係中日各半攤分外，其餘完全歸水綫公司所得，每年約二百萬元左右。中日無綫電路之開放，於電政經濟上大有裨益，固毫無疑義也。</p>
<h3 id="c285">無綫電應用短波的研究（二） <a href="#c285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— 王大椿</p>
<p>最長的電波，其周波率自每秒鐘十至一百基羅周波的，最適宜用於遠距離國際間的無綫電報，因其正確可靠，且不甚受大氣的擾害也。此項長波，其周波率之在每秒鐘五十基羅周波的，可以用作傳遞無綫電話，如倫敦至紐約的間横渡大西洋的無綫電話，卽應用此種長波，爲其例之一。</p>
<p>周波率之每秒鐘自二百至二千基羅周波的，此種電波，實際上適用於短距離通信，用於廣播，更爲相宜。每秒鐘二百基羅周波左右的電波，其性質與長波相同，而傳信的正確，亦可與長波無異。較高的周波率丨如每秒鐘二千基羅周波左右的丨當使用時，受話方面電磁圈的力量，在一日間，往往發生多次的變化，因有此特性，故功效較弱。</p>
<p>短波之於長途通信，現已日增其應用的價値，此種周波率，大致自每秒鐘三千至二萬五千基羅周波，周波率尤高，使用尤爲適宜。</p>
<p>電學家研究無綫電波傳播的性質，所謂（長波）和（短波）的分别，其解釋大致如下：長波的電磁浪，係直接從送話方，傳達至受話言的。至於短波，所有送話方發生的電磁浪，受高空間電子層（ＩｏｎｉａｓｄＬａｙｅｒ）的反射，然後播送至受話方的。</p>
<p>從經騐上說來，無綫電話應用短波的，亦有其劣點。蓋受話方的電磁塲，往往因一日間，畫夜不同，一年間，四季互異，及傳電路内，光明黑暗的路徑各别，感應力卽受其影響，而發生變化。但是，此種變化，固能設法减少，以至於極微，卽在受話方面，裝置自動控制器（ＡｕｔｏｍａｔｉｃＶｏｌｕｍｅＣｏｎｔｒｏｌ），依照受話信號音浪的高低，將擴大器隨意調整。此外尙有更妥善的方法，在同一回路内，使用各種不同的周波率，視環境的變遷，隨時作有效的調整。</p>
<p>短波無綫電最有價値的一點，因其有直射的功效，其播送電波，可擇定某一方向，單面發射，如在長波因天綫的高度，須視應用波長而定，欲使其單面直射，得良好的結果，卽使有重笨機械的設置，耗費鉅大的資本，恐亦難達美滿成功的目的。例如，最近的短波無綫電話，有應用凹面鏡，中空一小圓孔，電波因鏡面的凹度，集中於圓孔，向外輸送至天空電子層，反射至遠處受話機的。此種學理的實施，如使用長波則凹面鏡的圓面，因須兩倍於波長，其直徑至少數百公尺，而天綫網的幅面，因须數倍於波長，其高度將達五千公尺，此豈事實所許可，而長波就不能應用矣。近世短波無綫電所用的天綫，其長度和波長的比例，爲十倍，高度爲兩倍，此種比例，在十公尺以下的電波，固絶無問題，超過百公尺的電波，則事實上絶對困難，由此足徵短波就比較的有價値了。</p>
<p>現代無綫電機，應用反射天綫（Ｒｅｆｌｅｃｔｏｒ），和定向天綫（ＤｉｒｅｃｔｉｖｅＡｎｔｅｎｎａｓ）已成爲普遍的事實。此種方式，比較不定向方式，可增加播送率十五（Ｄｅｃｉｂｅｌｓ），故在無綫電交通上，增加效率，實在不少。</p>
<h3 id="c286">怎樣能使電報迅速？ <a href="#c286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— 靑</p>
<p>電報的功效是一個（快）字，所以電報也可稱爲（快報）。電報要是慢了，不但失去牠的效用，並且會誤人要事，所以電局的唯一責任，是在使電報到得愈快愈好！但是怎樣才能使電報達到快的目的，這是一個很重要的問題了！</p>
<p>一張電報從發報人交到電局，由電局拍發，送達收報人，中間經過的手續，上期寄然君已大略述及。總而言之，電報的迅速，所需要的條件，有下列四種：（一）辦理手續的簡捷，（二）電報機械的靈敏，（三）電報綫路的完好，（四）工作人員的勤奮。以上四項，如電局均能辦到，那電報快的使命，就很容易達到。反之，電局有一項不好，電報就難以迅速了！</p>
<p>那末，我們來看看現在電局對於以上說的四項，究竟怎麽樣？第一項，最近交通部參照各外國電局及商辦水綫公司的辦理電報手續，用科學化方法規定辦理手續的程序，在穏妥可靠的原則下，力求手續之簡單，俾辦理可以迅速。第二項，交通部在一年以前，就向英國購辦大批新式克利特電報機，電報打字機及鍵盤鑿孔機，不久就可在京，滬，津，漢，平，靑，濟，烟，福，厦，粤等處電局裝置。這種新式克利特電報機的好處，在甲局用鑿孔紙條放至乙局時，乙局也收到一般無二的鑿孔紙條，乙局就再把這條紙在機上放至丙局。若用舊式的韋斯登機，那末乙局收到的祇有用墨水印出符號的紙條。如須轉往丙局，祇可用人工鑿打紙條後再放至丙局。新式克利特機可以省去人工鑿孔，對於遠路電報必須經幾個電局轉遞者，就可快捷數倍。至於電報打字機與普通打字機用似，凡兩個直通電報的電局，可裝置此項機器，甲局打字，乙局卽印出所打之字，其快捷與普通打字機一般。键盤鑿孔機也與打字機差不多，不過字键撳下時，能在一種油紙條上鑿出符號，比較人工鑿孔，一點一畫的鑿起來，要快數倍。這三種機器裝用後，電報的速率，必可一新國人的耳目！第三項，交部近兩年來對於電報綫路竭力整理，現在除非逢到大風或匪禍，已少見阻斷的事，所以報務毫不有所延擱。第四項，交部對於電局工作人員的勤惰，近來時常派員考察，如有工作懈怠，延擱電報者，一律從嚴懲處，故近來辦事精神極爲振奮。尤其是收電報的人，已經再三飭令態度謙和，使發報人感覺滿意。同時電局又特設業務稽查員，向各商行及發電報的人，查問有否不滿意的地方，以便隨時查明改善。以上所說的四項，電局均已用極大之努力，以求電報之迅速，現在讓我來再談談收發報人方面，應該怎樣才能帮助電局使電報達到快的使命！</p>
<p>發華文電報的人如將電文用（電碼新編）自己譯成電碼，則不但省去譯費，並且可使電報交到電局時，立卽發出，省去電局譯電員譯成電碼的躭擱時間，因爲電局的譯電員，每班至多二三人，如同時收到十幾張華文電報，每人須翻譯三四張電報，事實上最後一張翻譯的，就不免略有躭擱了。當局至今没有取消譯費，就是這個緣故！</p>
<p>收報人方面有兩椿事，可以帮助電局，使電報投送迅速：（一）在收到電報時，務必在電報回單上簽註收到的時刻，這樣可使電局管理報差的人，可以知道該電究於何時送妥。如查有無故稽延情事，就可將報差懲處，以儆效尤。這樣可使報差送報不敢躭延，來報就可很快的送到收報人的手裏。（二）收報人對於報差最好不要滯留他，因爲每一報差出外送報，大都帶了二三份電報一次投送，如每一個收報人躭誤了報差好幾分鐘，那末最後投送的一份電報，就要被躭擱一二十分鐘了！同時一個報差在外躭擱過久，他回局就遲延了，因此電局其餘的來報，亦必受其影響，因爲他如早一刻回局；就可挨次再送其餘的電報了！雖然電局的報差很多，每班有好幾個，所有來報，並非一定須等某差回局，才可投送，不過報務很忙的時候，報差回局愈快，投送的速度愈增，這是顯明的事實。講到收報人滯留報差的原因，大約有兩種：第一，收報人正在忙着别事，無暇收受電報及簽字。（西人往往祇簽字，不蓋圓章。）第二，收報人因找尋圖章而躭延時間。關於這兩點，（一）希望收報人遇有電報立卽簽收。（二）本人圖章常放在身上或一定的所在，以免臨時耗費時間去找尋。這樣電局就受惠不淺了！</p>
<h3 id="c287">歐美長途電話近况 <a href="#c287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— 汪啓堃</p>
<p>一、前言</p>
<p>各國電話網與無綫電話網聯絡而成世界電話網，其實現旣已成功，各國對於國内電話網之充實，遂益切迫。一俟技術上諸問題研究解决後，其動向卽側重於長途電話回綫網之確立與完成。其内尤以德國因市内電話之自動化已近終了，更進而求長途電話之自動化，現已甚普及，歐洲其他小國亦不少此例。其在美國則美國電報電話公司曾於一九二九年開長途電話電纜網及附帶計畫會議，其决定事件亦已次第實行。美國各州電話原由在同一系統之下而名義不同之諸公司辦理，現在此項電話網！尤其長距離電話丨改由美國電報電話公司直轄，庶國内統一，對於設計及維持，皆可照計畫逐步推進。</p>
<p>二、德國之長途電話</p>
<p>德國之電話費依據距離而制定，例以五公里爲單位話费區域。凡在五公里以内（惟用户有十萬以上之都市，可照用户數目分别展至八公里，十公里，或十五公里）之通話，謂之普通市内通話，逾此謂之長途通話，更析分爲在七十五分里以下者爲近距離通話，三百公里以下者爲中距離通話，三百公里以上者爲遠距離通話。德國對於電話設備之投資如左表，其長途電話電纜之豐富與長途電話局之充足，皆極堪注意。</p>
<p>土地及房產局内設備地下電纜架空綫路其他共計市内電話百萬馬克一九四·一四０五·九五五七·五一八八·六六二·七一四０九·八　　　　　　百分率一三·八二八·八三九·六一三·四四·四一００·０長途電話百萬馬克一００·０六０·九五一四·七一一０·五三三·七八一九·八　　　　　　百分率一六·七九·八五０·三一七·八五·四一００·０　　長途電話有下列三種特徵，（一）通話費照時間及距離計算，（二）通話前須掛號等候，（三）長途電話接通時，如遇用户正在作市内通話，强使之中止。惟因逐漸採用立刻式通話後，其與市内電話相異之處，已僅剩第一項。所謂立刻式者，譬如由南京發電話至鎭江，因京鎭間綫路甚多，用户可立刻由京電話長途台接至鎭話局，甚至於用電話機上之轉號器直接轉至鎭局（如南京之於浦口，）並不經過京局長途台，僅由鎭局長途臺询明後爲之接至其所要之用户，如鎭話局亦係自動式，南京用户竟可完全直接自呌鎭江用户。</p>
<p>德國市内電話之自動化旣近全部完成，其全國長途電話回綫網亦已作成，並將長途電話局合併集中，於是以集中式小長途局（Ｅ·Ｆ·）爲細胞核，並於全國内選定適當都市五十五處，以爲第一中繼局（Ｖ·Ｆ·），又十五處爲第二中繼局（Ｄ·Ｆ·）。國内通話區域並限制，其綫路可接至任何地方，又綫路與局内裝置之通話當量（ＴｒａｎｓｍｉｓｓｉｏｎＥｑｕｉｖａｌｅｎ）如下：</p>
<p>市内通話　　用户至話局爲○·　一四五Ｎ（卽Ｎｏｐｅｒ），局内爲○·一五Ｎ，　　局際爲一Ｎ，共計二·二Ｎ。</p>
<p>長途電話　（一）市内部分，用户至市内局爲○·四五Ｎ，市内局内爲○·一五Ｎ，市内局至長途局爲○·三Ｎ，長途局内爲○·一Ｎ，合計一Ｎ，（二）長途部分，長途局與長途局爲一·三Ｎ，共計三·三Ｎ。</p>
<p>立刻長途通話，用户至市内局爲○·四五Ｎ，市内局内爲○·一五Ｎ，市内局至立刻局爲○·三Ｎ，立刻局内爲○·二五Ｎ，立刻局至立刻局爲一Ｎ，共計三·一Ｎ。</p>
<p>（甲）集中式小長途局（Ｅ·Ｆ·）</p>
<p>在半徑約三十五公里以内之長途局，皆集中於其中心點之Ｅ·Ｆ·局，其與本區各局之交換，槪用立刻式，區内其他各局相互間之通話，皆不經司機生，係完全自動式。故此項局際聯絡綫例不稱爲長途綫。相鄰之Ｅ·Ｆ·局相互間則採用立刻式之用五十週遠距離選出法者。</p>
<p>（乙）第一中繼局（Ｖ·Ｆ·）</p>
<p>在不設中間用中繼器（Ｒｅｐｅａｔｅｒ）之範圍内，此成爲Ｅ·Ｆ·局之中心局，在特别情形之下，間或設一個中間用中繼器。故其包括範圍爲半徑約一百四十公里。</p>
<p>（丙）第二中繼局（Ｄ·Ｆ·）</p>
<p>此備有大長途局之規模，凡來自Ｖ·Ｆ·之回綫皆在此集中，各Ｄ·Ｆ·局間設有直達回線。因地理上關係，亦有在此設國際電話局者。其因與　　電網相接，對於海外電話從事中繼者，謂之世界中繼局（Ｖ·Ｆ·），則設於柏林。</p>
<p>三·英國之長途電話</p>
<p>英國之長途電話分爲十八區（Ｚｏｎｅ），更析分爲一百七十羣（Ｇｒｏｕｐ），各設中心局。此項劃分法依據運用上之便利，與話費區域無涉。自一九三○年以來，於區中心局設Ｄｅｍａｎｄ臺，實行立刻式，此等局相互間設有直達線。羣中心局至其所屬之區中心局，亦設有直達線，插入中间用中繼器，線路等之通話當量之標凖大體如下：</p>
<p>１·屬於同一局内之二用户間，二·二Ｎ，</p>
<p>２·屬於同一區内，或相異之區（三百四十公里以内），或有直達綫之兩都市之用户間，二·七Ｎ</p>
<p>３·鄰接之區（三百四十公里以上）内用户間，四百八十公里以下之處，或無直達線而在四百八十至六百四十公里以下二都市之用户間，三·三Ｎ</p>
<p>４·其他長距離長途電話回線，三·九Ｎ</p>
<p>四·美國之長途電話</p>
<p>美國亦如德國，以二千五百局爲集中局，謂之ＴｏｌｌＣｅｎｔｅｒ（Ｔ·Ｃ），其第一中繼局謂之Ｐｒｉｍａｒｙｏｕｔｌｅｔ（Ｐ·Ｏ·）有一百五十所，此更與八個Ｒｅｇｉｏｎａｌｃｅｎｔｅｒ（Ｒ·Ｃ·）接有直達線，皆採用Ｃ·Ｌ·Ｒ·法之立刻式。其通話當量如左：</p>
<p>Ｔ·Ｃ·Ｐ·Ｏ·３·ｃｄｂＴ·Ｃ·Ｔ·Ｃ·６·ｏｄｂ　　Ｔ·Ｃ·Ｒ·３·５ｄｂＰ·Ｏ·Ｒ·Ｃ·３·５ｄｂ　　Ｒ·Ｃ·Ｒ·Ｃ·４·０ｄｂＰ·Ｏ·Ｐ·Ｏ·４·０ｄｂ　　直達線（終端局用）９·０ｄｂ終端局損失７·０ｄｂ</p>
<p>經過中繼局二所時之最大損失爲二十五ｄｂ（卽ｄｅｃｉｂｅｌｄｂ），美國與坎拿大間之最大通話當量爲三十一。。。</p>

<p>— 社友</p>
<p>（修訂三種電報規則）交部以各種電報規章大都已公布甚久，其中條文頗多不適於用，故最近將各種規章陸續修訂，以期適用。現經修訂公布者，爲振務電報規則新聞電報規則及郵轉電報章程等三種。振務電報規則内容與舊賬務電報免費章程大致相同，惟條文稍加整理。新聞電報規則内新添一種中途抄送辦法，凡新聞電報得由發報人請求由中途接轉之電局抄送當地新聞幾關，（中途不經轉之電局不能抄送，例如上海至南京係直達通報，蘇州不能抄送。）惟應於收報人姓名住址欄内加註（送某處某新聞機關）字樣。此項抄送電報中文每字收银一分英文或日文每字收銀二分。至郵轉電報章程修改之點最重要者，卽爲免收郵資，條文方面删繁就簡，以便民衆易於瞭解。此項新章各電局電臺及本社均可索閱。</p>
<p>（中日無綫電路開放）中日無綫電路自六月一日起正式開放，上海方面對於洋文華文及日文電報同時開始收發，内地則祇限收發洋文電報。通報電臺爲上海國際電臺與東京電臺，均用高速度自動收發報機工作，往來電報因日本東京電信局爲日本電報綫路之中心，故較之水綫電報必須經長崎轉遞者，更爲迅速。再華文及日文電報計字收費辦法如下：</p>
<p>（一）姓名地址　收報地名及收報人姓名住址不論幾字，槪作一字計費。惟抄送電報加一收報人名及地址者，應加一字計算。</p>
<p>（二）電文　華文電報可用數碼接連書寫，如（中華）二字可書作（○○二二五四七八），每七個數碼作一字計費，較原來照洋文電報計費者，（卽四碼作一　字，又收報人姓名住址按字計費。）减省報費兩三倍以上。日文電報則須用日本假名書寫，每七個假名作一字計费，詳細辦法可向仁記路國際電臺詢問。</p>

<p>— 記者</p>
<p>（李衍宗君問）（一）敝處離城五十里·電報由信差送來，須付專力費，民衆甚感困難，可否統歸郵差代送，不另取資。</p>
<p>（三）依照新章收報人姓名住址不逾十五字者，一律按照五字收費，如逾此字數，是何等算法？又敝縣電報未通，可否能託郵局代收轉拍？</p>
<p>（答）（一）查電報註明專送者，係以一電一差隨到隨送，故酌收專力費，不便統歸郵差代送，以免延誤。但專力費之收取，有一定章程，請閱本社所贈之（電報省費新章摘要）（丁）項便知。</p>
<p>（二）華文電報收報人姓名住址逾十五字者計費方法，請閱本社所贈之（電報省費新章摘要）（乙）項便知。貴縣未設電局，可託郵局代收，此項電報，名爲郵電轉報，在郵局方面，係照寄遞快信，故亦異常迅速。且自二十三年三月一日起，一律照電報局定價收費，不另加收郵資。</p>
<p>（無錫某君問）下列一電可否作爲明電：（江米漲管十二二）電局收報員對於電文内（管）字認爲意義不通，代改爲「每包」二字，是否合法？請見示。</p>
<p>（答）該電可作爲明碼電報，惟電局收報員如對電文意義發生疑義，發報人應詳細解釋，以免誤會。至代改電文，當然不合法，可拒絶代改。</p>

<h3 id="c291">薩爾瓦多承認僞國矣 <a href="#c291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>以日人之處心積慮，狡滑陰謀，與夫國際間之勾結軋轢，見利忘義，吾人早知承認僞國，繼日而起者，必將大有其人。前不久，德有承認之風聞，美有承認之傳說。雖二國之承認，均未見諸實現，曾幾何時，今日中美蕞爾小邦之薩爾瓦多，竟明目張膽，不惜違反國際信義，觸犯國聯盟約，破壞各國對滿共同陣綫，而公然宣布予以承認矣。據報載：（薩爾瓦多共和國，於本月十九日，由其駐東京總領事通知日本，及駐日僞滿洲國代表，稱該國自本年三月三日起，正式承認滿洲國。）</p>
<p>按不承認（滿洲國，）早經國聯一九三二年三月十一日通過在案。而薩爾瓦多爲國聯會員國之一，當時雖不投票，亦未宣布棄權，在法理上，對該議决案，自有遵守之必要。而今竟不顧一切，放棄此必須履行之義務，首先破壞盟約，加以承認，其影響於國聯自身之根本問題，實甚嚴重。據華盛頓國際時局觀察者之推測：（薩爾瓦多承認（滿洲國）之作用，無非欲與美國爲難而已。蓋薩爾瓦多在遠東之利害關係，無足輕重，故此次行動，除使美國對鄰近小國之攻策稍感棘手外，實無重要意義。）此若屬實，吾人以爲國際間行爲，未免太近兒戲。爲欲洩發私忿，竟不擇手段，對國聯盟約加以毁棄，遺人以無窮禍患，此不啻爲國際道義之賊。對此不負責任之卑劣叛徒，今後國聯倘不予以嚴厲之懲治，驅逐出會，則國聯僅存之威信，將喪失無餘。</p>
<p>然而吾人之見解，以爲今番薩爾瓦多之承認僞國，其用意何在，雖尙難明瞭，或如美國人士之所傳，含有多少爲難美國之成分，亦未可知，但其必受日人暗中利誘愚弄，可以斷言。蓋日人在國際間之企圖活動承認僞滿，已見心勞力疲。而截至現在，世界各大國，雖有不少因利害關係，欲加承認者，但終因有所顧忌，未敢貿然試之。於是日人在失望之餘，遂轉而籠絡小國如薩爾瓦多者，不惜假獻慇懃，誘其承認。因薩爾瓦多亦一國聯會員國，彼一承認，僞滿雖未見便能增高其國際間之地位，然國聯反滿之陣綫，必起動搖，斯亦足償其宿願耳。</p>
<p>關於承認僞國問題，前途實不容樂觀。據巴黎經濟財政通信社所觀察，謂（美國雖曾以種種迂迴曲折之手段，欲使日本陷於孤立，今日本乃乘機與美國以一擊，拉丁美洲其他國家，或將步薩爾瓦多之後塵，亦未可知。）吾人證之以英國前此所取之態度，亦知將來繼起而承認僞滿者，必接踵而至。英國爲擁護國聯最力之國，其應嚴守國聯不承認僞國議决案，固不待言。然當往日美日倡言諒解之際，對於美國之承認僞滿事件，倫敦方面，竟有贊成之傾向，謂（美國之承認滿洲，實爲英國所歡迎，英國則以爲滿洲國之存在，爲期尙遠，而日本在滿之覇局，一時尙難以動搖，英國之與國聯，甚爲接近，故英國不欲國聯對於滿洲國之態度，而首先承認之也，然英國願美國採取承認滿洲國之步驟，以爲他日效法之地步，）。</p>
<p>僞滿爲日人一手所造成，早爲世人所妬忌。然各國旣經决議不承認於前，又屢欲加以承認於後，何哉？此正如該通信社所云：（滿洲無論成爲中國之行省，或受日本之保護，其前途發展，未可限量，此爲世人所咸知，是則各國此後不免埀涎欲滴，自屬無疑，現正與華盛頓從事外交戰之一中美小國，所以能一舉推翻國聯大會鄭重通過之反日决議者，實以此故也。）換言之，卽利之所在耳。此所以吾曰，承認僞國問題，前途未許樂觀也。</p>
<p>關於薩爾瓦多之承認僞國，今後之計，不在國聯之如何予以裁制，美日如何再起糾葛，而在吾國自己之如何發憤振作耳。</p>
<h3 id="c292">季候與創造力 <a href="#c292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>— 天華</p>
<p>假如把春天比作少女的話，夏天便應該是一個濃裝艷抹的少婦了。蕭瑟肅殺的秋容易使我們想到一個遲暮的半老徐娘，凛冽嚴寒的冬令便會喚起我們领悟到一個老太婆的孤戚。不但女子，人的一生大都可作如是之比觀。儘管有人把健全的精神作標凖，談一個老年人，假設他是進取的戰鬭的，他可以是一個（老靑年）；一個靑年，若是他缺乏這種𤍠情和活力，他不免是一個（遺少），是老了大半截的。然而靑年的𤍠情和老年的𤍠情，到底是有點不同，靑年到底是具有更大的生命力的。這正像那被比作靑年時代的春夏的季節，其對於人類之更有貢獻性，和秋冬比較，到底是不可同日而語的。秋天的落葉使我們感到飄零，冬天的風雪使我們感到凄冷。只有春和夏，尤其是這春末和夏初，才給我們最大的生命力與創造力。在這期間，我們用愉快的眼睛看事物，用活躍勃發的心從事工作。這時我們的興緻特别好，工作的效率也格外大！這些都是氣候賞賜給我們的。</p>
<p>我們不難找出許多例子。世界上有許多發明和創作都是在這春夏的季節裏表現牠們的存在的。五六月尤適宜於發明和創作。哥侖布因深信地圓之說，欲發現由西方至印度之航路，因而發現新大陸！他却是在五六月間才起此航行之意的加里雷發明望遠鏡，後又用望遠鏡觀察月球中的斑點，說月球和地球一樣有凹凸，决非渾圓無缺！這些發明或發現都是四五六幾個月間努力獲得的。哥德的浮士德是在三四月間寫的。但丁的許多詩也多半是在春夏的季節裏寫的。有人根據世界許多傑作著述的年月，說一年四季中五月最適宜於創作，其次的順序是四月，六月，三月，（三月六月一樣）九月，七月，八月。其不適宜於創作的月份是十一月，一月，十月，十二月，二月！其中二月最壞，不能創作。從上面這些事實裏我們知道我們現在正處在生命力最活躍的五月份裏，正處在這（多事）的五月份裏。其實，五月的所以（多事），正好给予我們五月是人們最活躍最有生命力的一月一個强有力的證明。全世界的工人在五月剛開始的一天就表示他們的活力。五月三日，五月四日，五月九日，五月三十日，都各代表人們在這月份中最活躍的一環。我敢說，將來世界上的大變動，如大革命，大戰爭，大……都將在五月及其隣近的幾個月裏有更多的發生的機會。季候對於人們的影響是不可否認的。</p>
<p>其實，這幾乎是不言而喻的。在春夏的季節裏，鳥唱的歌特别好聽，羽毛也更豐美。獸類在這期間身軀特别雄偉，壯觀。人類的臉上這時也格外浮現了生動的活潑的微笑，内心裏更充滿了生命的活力，彌漫了春情！一切者都表示着季候的賞賜的偉大。</p>
<p>我們不可辜負這樣的好季候，我們都來發揮我們潛在的生命力和創造力吧！</p>

(3) Offices of the agency will be established in eight stations including Pingjin, Tangshan, Qindao, Shanhaiguan, Jinzhou, Goubangzi, and Shenyang to sell direct through train tickets.

Regarding how Sino-Japanese parties should handle future profits and losses after the railway opens, a provision already exists in the plan discussed by Yin Tong and Ota, so Xu Wenguo, Deputy Director of the Bei-Ning Railway, did not mention it during his trip east in his meeting with Japanese South Manchurian Railway personnel. Xu will return to Tianjin immediately to report the results of the discussions to Yin Tong in Beijing via telegram. Yin has already arrived in Beijing from Shanghai and is seeking instructions from relevant superiors. He is scheduled to go north on the 31st. Generally speaking, the realization of the railway opening will be after Huang Fu returns north, but Huang has no definite news of going to Beijing in the short term because he is waiting to meet with Arite.

The (Manchukuo) Ministry of Foreign Affairs has demanded an apology from Soviet Russia within three days. It is not mentioned what (Manchukuo) will do if Soviet Russia ignores this demand. At the same time, two other Manchukuo ships sailing to Daheihe were shelled by Russian soldiers. Whether there were any casualties is currently unknown. It is reported that eight Russian gunboats are currently gathered near Hailanpao. Political figures here feel that a dangerous situation is developing. The (Manchukuo) authorities call the actions of the Russian soldiers tyrannical, tantamount to inviting immediate war. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet Russian authorities state that in the Heilongjiang shooting of the (Manchukuo) ship incident, the Manchukuo ship "Yanghu" sailed six yards from the Russian shore on Sunday and Russian soldiers fired warning shots. The ship then sailed towards Daheihe. The next day, another Manchukuo ship sailed into the Russian territory of Sayakou, about 35 yards from the shore, and sailed about one mile, taking many photographs. Russian soldiers fired warning shots, but the ship ignored them. The Russian soldiers then fired on the ship, which then turned towards Daheihe and sailed away. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Boli (Khabarovsk) "Manchukuo" ships again intruded into the Soviet border along the Heilongjiang River on May 27th and 28th. On May 27th, border guards saw a steamer flying the Manchukuo flag sailing upstream, only five meters from the Soviet shore. The border guards fired two shots as a warning, and the ship immediately left the Soviet shore and sailed towards Sakhalin Town. On May 28th, another ship flying the Manchukuo flag and a tugboat sailed into the mouth of the Zeya River (a river within Soviet territory), sailing upstream for one kilometer, 30 to 35 meters from the shore. The captain of the ship had a camera set up and continuously took pictures of the Soviet shore. The border guards fired two shots into the air to try to stop the ship, but the ship paid no attention to the border guards' warnings and continued to move along the Soviet shore. The border guards then fired a shot at the ship, which immediately changed direction and sailed into the Heilongjiang River, mooring near Sakhalin Town. A detailed investigation is currently underway regarding this incident. (TASS, 30th)</p>
<p>(Dalian) Changchun received news today that a team of Russian soldiers and 500 Mongolian soldiers fought fiercely yesterday at Jigenhan (transliteration), 110 kilometers southeast of Kulun, and were defeated and retreated. Previously, the commander of the Russian army in the area ordered that all Mongolian livestock be handed over by May 30th to supply the Russian army in Weirwenqingkisk. The Mongolians refused, so a Russian major led 30 soldiers and killed several Mongolians as a warning. As a result, 500 Mongolians surrounded and annihilated the Russian soldiers. Upon receiving the news, Soviet Russia immediately sent a team of Buryat soldiers to attack, but they were ultimately repelled by the Mongolians. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>(London) It was heard today that the London Soviet Russian purchasing agency has purchased wheat from Australia and Argentina to transport to Vladivostok. According to the Financial Times, the total amount shipped is 22,500 tons, including two batches from Australia and one from Argentina. It is expected that a large number will be shipped soon. The reason for this purchase of wheat by Soviet Russia is believed by many to be due to a poor harvest in Soviet Russia, or because the garrison in Vladivostok has increased since the tense relations between Japan and Russia, so wheat sales have also greatly increased. According to recent reports, in the past 18 months, Soviet Russia has transported large quantities of grains, cement, and other raw materials from the Black Sea to Vladivostok, which proves that the latter is indeed credible. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the incident in the Heilongjiang Province where Soviet Russia shot at the (Manchukuo) ship "Jixian", and similar incidents that have occurred repeatedly since then, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs recognizes that the occurrence of such incidents is regrettable and intends to lodge a protest with Russia at an appropriate time.

<p>(Dalian) Fundraising began here today to raise 700,000 Japanese yen to cover the cost of air defense in Dalian. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) It is reported that Puyi is now recruiting 16 former Russian military officers as bodyguards, who must be skilled in shooting and at least six feet tall to qualify. (Reuters, 30th)</p>

<p>(Washington) Cuba and the United States signed a new treaty today, sweeping away thirty years of estrangement between the two countries, and the United States completely abandoned its position as Cuba's protector. After Secretary of State Hull and Cuban Ambassador to the United States Magus signed the treaty at the State Department, President Roosevelt immediately sent a message to the Senate, requesting prompt approval. This new treaty will become the basis for various political relations between the two countries. The Platt Amendment to the Cuban Constitution, which granted the United States the right to interfere in Cuba's internal affairs, is hereby abolished. Cuban circles here unanimously expressed their joy at the conclusion of the new treaty, saying that with the abolition of the Platt Amendment, Cuba has leaped to become a completely independent and autonomous country. Secretary of State Hull also issued an official statement announcing the establishment of the new treaty and the abolition of the 1903 treaty. However, various treaty rights enjoyed by the United States in Cuba before the establishment of the Cuban Republic after the Spanish-American War remain valid. Therefore, the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay remains. The State Department also stated that the new treaty will take effect upon approval by the governments of both countries. In his message, the President urged Congress to pay attention to the new treaty, which abolished the United States' right to interfere in Cuba's internal affairs and determine its financial and health policies. The President's message stated that what the government wants to declare after the completion of this treaty is that the US government not only opposes the policy of military intervention but also abandons all rights of interference. Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, believes that this is the most important announcement since the implementation of the Monroe Doctrine. Pittman said that the new treaty will end all misunderstandings and suspicions between the United States and Cuba. So-called non-interference does not mean that the United States does not want to land to protect American expatriates when incidents occur. (National Telegram, 29th)</p>

<h3 id="e28">Reminiscing on the Tanggu Truce Anniversary: Remembering the Righteous Armies Fighting Against Japan <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>— Ting</p>
<p>According to various surveys, the number of times righteous armies appeared in Liaoning Province during the past year was as high as 6,298. The cumulative number of righteous army members was no less than 467,691. There were 134 leaders, not including the three provinces of Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Jehol. In January and February of this year, the Japanese army mobilized to deal with the righteous armies in various places a total of 401 times, with 53,876 soldiers participating (excluding puppet troops). There were 182 righteous army leaders with 97,638 followers. In March, there were 4,734 recorded attacks by the righteous armies, with 277 leaders and 13,756 followers. Among the leaders, Wang Delin, Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, Kong Xianrong, Deputy Commander, and Zhang Zhichao, Commander-in-Chief of the East China National Salvation Army, all have strong influence. The most active areas for the righteous armies are Fengcheng, Andong, Xiuyan, and Tonghua in Liaoning Province; Raohe, Hulin, Dongning, Ning'an, and Yilan (Sanxing) in Jilin Province; and Lindian, Anda, Hailun, Hulan, and Zhaodong in Heilongjiang Province; and Wujiazi, Sanjiazi, and Jialigou in Jehol Province. Their footprints can be found everywhere else.</p>
<p>With the Northeast fallen, the local righteous armies, compelled by righteous indignation, rose up in arms and fought bloody battles. Dressing their wounds, they continued to kill the enemy. The fact that our country's barely surviving national spirit and morale were able to be maintained and not decline is truly like the lingering light in the Lu Temple, which is all the more precious. The heroic and resolute anti-Japanese warriors stirred the ears and eyes of people within the Guannei (south of Shanhaiguan) and aroused strong sympathy. However, since the signing of the Tanggu Truce, rear support suddenly ceased. The righteous armies had no choice but to make a final struggle amidst hardship. On this anniversary of the signing of the Truce, reminiscing about the anti-Japanese warriors in the Black Mountains and White Waters, I truly have a feeling of unbearable regret.</p>
<p>The general public often underestimates the anti-Japanese movement of the righteous armies, thinking that the Japanese, with their sharp weapons, are like crushing dry weeds and destroying rotten wood when facing our loosely organized righteous armies. Therefore, they feel that the righteous armies are, at best, a minor irritation to the puppet regime and are not significant. In fact, this is just a common sense deduction and is not entirely true when considered in reality.</p>
<p>We do not need to be overly pessimistic about the current anti-Japanese movement of the righteous armies. What should be recognized is the following facts:</p>
<p>(1) The righteous armies all adopt guerrilla tactics. They break up into smaller units, and each small team operates independently. When the Japanese army chases a small number of soldiers, they surround and annihilate them. When there are many, they disperse and hide in the mountains. The Japanese and puppet troops are often exhausted and helpless.</p>
<p>(2) The Jidong Triangle Area (bounded by the Songhua River to the north, the Ussuri River to the south, and the Mudanjiang River to the west) has been a stronghold for the righteous armies since the September 18th Incident. The righteous armies there have now relied on natural defenses to dig trenches. On the one hand, they implement a system of land distribution based on population, with each household cultivating their own land and becoming self-sufficient. On the other hand, they select secluded places in the mountains and forests to train their troops and boost morale. This unit of the righteous army is the most organized and has the most strength. Many righteous armies from Liaoning, Heilongjiang, and Jehol provinces have come to join them after hearing about them. It is also said that they are preparing to complete an entire organization by mid-June of this year for long-term resistance against Japan. Recently, with the green gauze tents (tall sorghum stalks) rising and the clouds of war between Japan and Russia gradually thickening, Jidong is located between the borders of Japan and Russia. Once the international situation undergoes drastic changes, the righteous armies in that area will become a serious threat to the Japanese army in the Northeast. This can be asserted.</p>
<p>(3) Due to special circumstances, people in the Northeast have long had guns for self-defense. In order to prepare for war against Russia and eliminate the righteous armies, the Japanese ordered the puppet Manchukuo to confiscate civilian guns to prevent them from secretly communicating with the righteous armies. However, the people in various counties, feeling that it was difficult to hide and fearing that it would be difficult to revolt in the future, instead contacted each other and resisted. For example, more than 3,000 people from Chaoyang, Lingyuan, Jinxi, Xingcheng, and other counties in Jehol jointly launched an uprising and fought against the Japanese and puppet troops stationed there. People in Fujin and Hulin in Jidong took their guns into the mountains to join the anti-Japanese effort. Even those who did not go into the mountains were willing to voluntarily send their guns to the righteous armies rather than hand them over to the Japanese and puppet authorities. The situation in other counties, except for Liaoyang, Shenyang, Haicheng, and Panshan, which obeyed the order to hand over their guns, is also extremely chaotic. As of recently, the situation has become increasingly large-scale. The Japanese's actions have promoted the anti-Japanese united front between farmers and the righteous armies, which is worth noting.</p>
<p>(4) The troops of the puppet regime are forced by their living conditions and environment and are not willing to serve the enemy. Therefore, they often put on a show of force when attacking the righteous armies and are unwilling to exert themselves. They often mutiny and return to the right side when they encounter a suitable opportunity. Mutinies have been very common in recent months. There have been news of puppet troops revolting in Antu, Yingkou, Fusong, Changbai, Sanxing, and Jiaohe. The momentum of the righteous armies has greatly increased.</p>
<p>(5) Japan's invasion of Northeast China was intended to make the fertile land of the Northeast a place for its surplus population to live. However, since the implementation of immigration, it has repeatedly failed. The armed immigration in Jiamusi, Hunan, and other places in Jilin Province has been particularly difficult, and even the hard-earned businesses have felt thorny due to the attacks of the righteous armies. The difficulty of the Japanese immigration plan is due to the righteous armies.</p>
<p>All of the above may be sufficient to correct the public's understanding of the anti-Japanese movement of the righteous armies and not think that it has no far-reaching impact. Although the righteous armies are forced by their environment and cannot make grand plans to recover lost territory, they have stood on the front line of the anti-Japanese war for so many years and have been indomitable and brave. Their spirit of perseverance and determination can be a model for the people and deserves the highest respect. The signing of the Tanggu Truce is an ironclad fact in the past and need not be mentioned. Will we stand by and watch the anti-Japanese warriors on the front line and let them live and die on their own? Or will we wait for the opportunity to mature before providing them with strong support?</p>
<h3 id="e29">At the Disarmament Conference: A Head-on Collision Between Britain and France: Past Understandings Dissipated: Simon Directly Opposes Security Organizations: Advocates for the Rapid Establishment of a Disarmament Treaty: Barthou Attacks Germany's Restoration of Armaments: Expresses Unwillingness to Accommodate and Dig Its Own Grave <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The General Commission held its third meeting today.</p>
<p>The British Foreign Secretary spoke first. (Geneva) After today's meeting of the General Disarmament Commission, British Foreign Secretary Simon spoke first, stating the importance of the Disarmament Conference and the entire system of cooperative efforts with direct words. Everyone knows that the British government is committed to resolving the deadlock, but has not yet reached a compromise on a new foundation. He is extremely dissatisfied with the policy of delaying and making empty talk. Changing the Disarmament Conference into a conference to discuss a security convention will not help. Now there must be practical progress. Regarding the question of whether Germany's plan to rearm can be the basis for an international agreement, he advocates for the immediate establishment of a draft treaty, incorporating the various clauses that have already been agreed upon and the necessary new concessions. He suggests three things: (1) chemical warfare, (2) budget, and (3) the establishment of a permanent disarmament commission. The British government feels that the method contained in the British memorandum of January 29 is more likely to produce an agreement than any specific proposal. The memorandum proposed by the representatives of Denmark, Spain, Norway, and Switzerland is in line with the one proposed by Britain. Simon concluded by saying that if the Disarmament Conference cannot adopt the suggestions contained in this memorandum or a similar approach, he does not believe that a disarmament treaty can be realized.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Barthou's Sharp Counter-Argument <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>French Foreign Minister Barthou spoke next, strongly refuting Simon's remarks and the British government's proposal, greatly straining the atmosphere of the meeting. He said that it is easier to achieve results by addressing the issue of security than by addressing the clauses contained in the British memorandum. France strictly abides by the 1925 Anglo-French agreement prohibiting the export of military supplies and implements of war (this statement is probably referring to the fact that Britain sold aircraft engines to Germany, and the British government claimed it was purely a commercial transaction). Given the difficulty of the situation, the time for euphemistic compliance or accommodation and compromise has passed. He knows that there are countries that have never feared aerial attacks but are now worried about the scourge of aerial warfare, but there are still other countries in the world threatened by land and naval forces. What he wants to know is, did Germany withdraw from the League of Nations, causing the agreement of last October to be impossible to implement? Can the Disarmament Conference allow itself to be manipulated by a country that insults the League of Nations itself? Britain has asked to build a path connecting France and Germany based on ideals that it believes France can gladly accept, but France is deeply concerned that there is a trap. He supports the French memorandum of April 17. Judging from Germany's military spending, it can be recognized that Germany has increased its war preparations, while France has reduced its military spending. The French memorandum has never closed the door to a general agreement and asks the Disarmament Conference to continue its work. France also supports its January 1st note, which has contributed all kinds of disarmament that the General Commission wants to have in the field of security.</p>
<p>French Foreign Minister Barthou's remarks have caused the Disarmament Conference to once again encounter the question of which is more urgent, disarmament or security. Barthou's remarks indirectly involve the actions of British Foreign Secretary Simon in past negotiations. The words are both satirical and unfriendly, arousing general criticism. According to the opinions of those in the audience, the French Foreign Minister's tone has destroyed the possibility of understanding between Britain and France. Seeing this development, Chairman Henderson announced a recess until Friday, so that the representatives would have the opportunity to consider the overall situation. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Although French Foreign Minister Barthou's speech was postponed for one day and was not announced at the opening, it still did not lose its spicy flavor. He made fierce attacks on Simon's mediation efforts and the position insisted upon by Germany. It was the most severe and explicit statement in French diplomacy since the first year after the European War. Barthou said that France's steadfast and unyielding attitude is truly admirable, because France still does not abandon its claim of last October 14 and will never allow a disarmed country to rearm. He recited the arguments made by representatives of various countries that day and said that they must not change their attitude because Germany withdrew from the League of Nations. However, France does not say that the door to the disarmament conference is closed because it has a note of April 17. Because the door to the disarmament conference is still wide open today. Barthou then made a detailed assessment of Germany's military preparations and budget, saying that the numbers were sufficient to prove that Germany had actually begun to increase its military preparations. As for security, Barthou said that he did not completely agree with Litvinov's proposal, but Litvinov's proposal had indicated a path for progress on the issue of security.

<p>(Geneva) Representatives of various countries to the Disarmament Conference are very busy today trying to repair the wounds inflicted by French Foreign Minister Barthou's startling speech yesterday. The seriousness of the situation is well known to all, and the authorities' anxiety goes without saying. All parties are now working to break through this difficult situation. Representatives of small countries, such as Spain and Sweden, are very active. They held a meeting this afternoon to discuss ways to salvage the crisis and decided to use their memorandum of April 14 as a basis for making progress on practical issues. Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson is also trying to promote progress in the situation. Therefore, he met with British Foreign Secretary Simon, French Foreign Minister Barthou, and Swedish Foreign Minister Sandler today. It is heard that after the Polish Foreign Minister speaks at the General Commission meeting tomorrow, the representatives of various small countries will follow up and express their opinions. (Reuters, 31st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) French Foreign Minister Barthou's attacks on British Foreign Secretary Simon at yesterday's General Commission meeting is the only topic of conversation in Geneva today. Many representatives feel that they have now entered a stormy sea, and it is difficult to predict what will happen next. Because Barthou's remarks have been met with mixed praise and criticism. The Little Entente countries and those who support security first and disarmament second welcome it. However, even pro-French factions like Belgium regret that their remarks lack understanding. The Italians expressed their agreement upon hearing these attacks. One noteworthy point of the meetings in the past two days is that both Simon and Litvinov supported the organization of a permanent disarmament body. It is expected that this move will provide the General Disarmament Commission with a basis for continuing its work. According to news from Paris, the French newspapers believe that Barthou's criticism of Simon is a shocking development. Although critics generally believe that the British Foreign Secretary's remarks were disappointing, it is no wonder that Barthou made this criticism. However, they all consider this unexpected conflict between British and French policies to be strange. All newspapers hope that it will not have serious consequences. (Reuters, 31st)</p>

<p>(Berlin) Berlin newspapers described the situation in Geneva, saying that Barthou and Litvinov were like performing a duet, and the head-on conflict between Britain and France has increased rather than decreased. Most German newspapers have taken a wait-and-see attitude, only writing about the speeches of Litvinov and Barthou in their verbal battle with the other representatives. They all believe that Barthou's many words have defeated himself. (National Telegram, 31st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) French Foreign Minister Barthou's speech at the General Disarmament Commission yesterday arrived here too late. The newspapers did not have time to ask the authorities for instructions before adding comments. Therefore, the tone has not been consistent. However, the comments in this morning's newspapers all use very strong language for Barthou's speech. (Havas, 31st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov's remarks in Geneva yesterday had subtle criticisms of Germany. However, newspapers here apparently regard this as insignificant. The Berliner Börsen-Zeitung published an opinion today saying, "After the new marriage between Russia and France, Litvinov actually believed during his honeymoon that his speech could be used to directly or indirectly attack and slander Germany. But this kind of behavior should not surprise us, because representatives of Soviet Russia have no qualifications to condemn Germany, pointing to it as the center of world turmoil, because every child of three feet knows today that Moscow is the location of the microbe manufacturing plant. The whole world is still suffering from its infectious harm. Today, the scourge of communism has spread to countless countries, and Hitler has already given a considerable performance on how to prevent this scourge." (National Telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) German newspapers commented on Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov's speech in Geneva, and the wording was generally severe. The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung said, "Soviet Russia has no right to accuse Germany of having warlike intentions." The newspaper used a large headline to comment on Litvinov's speech, saying, "Litvinov is defending the French General Staff's claims." The Börsen-Zeitung went on to comment on US representative Davis's speech, saying that the United States has felt the impact of European issues and is now paying special attention to it, which can be called satisfactory.

<p>Rome Italian public opinion is quite appreciative of French Foreign Minister Barthou's speech at the Disarmament Commission yesterday, considering this speech to be very important and to have the nature of questioning Britain. The newspapers also say that this speech is essentially only a reiteration of France's former claims and at the same time can create the impression that they are slightly approaching the Italian viewpoint.

<h3 id="e34">A Speech by the Russian and French Foreign Ministers: Unanimous Sympathy from the French Press <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) This morning, all the newspapers here commented on Foreign Minister Barthou's speech to the General Disarmament Commission yesterday. They unanimously believed that Barthou's speech represented the thinking of the majority of the French people. At a time when the danger of German rearmament is increasing daily, and when the insular mindset of Britain is still frequently expressed, the French people cannot help but feel a sense of antipathy. No one can more accurately represent this antipathy than Barthou in his speech yesterday. The press also believes that the greatest benefit of Barthou's speech is to once again establish the issue of security as the foundation of disarmament. (Le Journal) stated that people at the League of Nations unanimously approved of Barthou's speech, which shows that it deeply resonated with people. The wishes of France's loyal friends and allies, such as Poland and the Little Entente countries, were especially represented by Barthou. In his speech, Barthou greatly praised Mussolini's determination and his creative achievements, which made the Italians feel doubly happy. (Le Matin) summarized the spirit of Barthou's speech, roughly stating that Barthou first used extremely humble words to satirize the self-satisfaction of the British, then proceeded to use firm words to criticize the arrogance of Germany, and finally expressed regret at the passivity of the League of Nations. "Le Petit Parisien" stated that Barthou's speech was able to express the fear felt by the French people due to German rearmament. The Little Entente countries, the signatory countries of the Balkan Pact, and the Central European countries friendly to France all expressed satisfaction with this speech, which is clearly visible. "Le Petit Journal" stated that Barthou was able to express an unshakeable theory with a clear and firm attitude, and all those who agreed with Barthou's views felt heartfelt joy. "L'Echo de Paris" stated that people generally believed that British Foreign Secretary Simon's words seemed to advise people to value themselves with wisdom, but after Barthou's speech, this kind of mistaken thinking no longer exists. Barthou's speech is truly a major event in the history of the League of Nations. (Havas, 31st)</p>
<p>(Paris) The press greatly praised the speech given by Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov at the General Disarmament Commission yesterday. "Le Petit Parisien" stated, "In all of Litvinov's proposals, there is a part that can be put into practice. International assistance for peacebuilding is so sincere that it makes people feel doubly interested. We cannot but give credit to Moscow." "Le Petit Journal" stated that Litvinov's speech provided valuable support to France, because under the pressure of the political situation on the east bank of the Rhine, no one dares to regard security as a negligible issue. "L'Echo de Paris" believed that Litvinov's speech was issued after careful consultation between Paris, Moscow, Ankara, and the Little Entente countries. The newspaper stated, "Litvinov supports France's position on security and attacks the views of Britain and Italy. It can be seen that the empty talk and theories of the disarmament conference have ultimately led to failure over the past two years, and the responsibility should not be borne by France." "L'Intransigeant" stated that Litvinov's speech contained clever, good, and substantive suggestions. The newspaper's correspondent in Geneva commented on the matter, saying, "Litvinov's speech made a very deep impression. From now on, no country will be able to accuse France of improperly contacting Soviet Russia." (Havas, 30th)</p>

<p>(London) Yesterday, the British and French foreign ministers delivered speeches in Geneva regarding the disarmament issue, and their opinions were quite divergent. The moderates and the Conservative Party in the British government both expressed regret and were very anxious about this situation. This can be seen in the tone of the newspapers. The newspapers mostly took a moderate tone regarding the disarmament proposals presented by French Foreign Minister Barthou. (Havas, 31st)</p>
<p>(London) Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov delivered a speech at the General Disarmament Commission in Geneva yesterday, advocating that the disarmament conference be changed into a permanent conference for safeguarding peace, to discuss various important issues to eliminate war. Judging from the initial criticisms issued by the British newspapers, it seems that only the remarks of the Liberal Party and Labour Party newspapers expressed sympathy for Litvinov's proposal. For example, the Liberal Party's organ newspaper, the News Chronicle, stated that Litvinov's proposal has considerable benefits and is worthy of careful study by the world, because the United States, Soviet Russia, and Japan do not need to join the League of Nations because of this, and can participate in the League of Nations' political work. Even Germany can more easily participate in the permanent conference proposed by Litvinov than in other meetings of the League of Nations. The Labour Party's Daily Herald also stated that the Russian Foreign Minister's words certainly have this kind of benefit. The newspaper had many criticisms of the Soviet Russian plan, because the Soviet Russian plan confirmed that a disarmament treaty could not be concluded. On the contrary, the Conservative Party's organ newspaper, the Daily Telegraph, held a different opinion, saying, "The Russian Foreign Minister wants to establish this kind of permanent conference outside the League of Nations. If this is not to say that Soviet Russia and other powers will be outside the League of Nations and display their management skills in the new conference, then we truly do not understand the reason." The Times stated that such a claim would allow Germany to return to Geneva and regain its former position, and faithfully adhere to its consistent view, saying that Hitler's proposal should be accepted by Geneva as a basis for reaching an agreement.

Litvinov's speech was based on the following facts: the issue of disarmament has no room for reconciliation due to the divergent opinions expressed at the conference, so it cannot be resolved. When Litvinov explained the main differences of opinion, he stated, "Two extremely different tendencies have been revealed from the beginning. One is represented by the Soviet delegation, and the other is actually advocated by other delegations. The Soviet delegation does not want to regard disarmament as an independent and self-sufficient issue, and is only satisfied with the purposes of budgeting, economics, propaganda, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e38">As Long as Disarmament Exists, War Cannot be Fundamentally Eliminated <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>We want to see disarmament as a true method to eliminate war. In the past and now, we believe that if armaments cannot be completely abolished, then war can never be truly eliminated. As long as armaments exist, peace can never be truly guaranteed. At the same time, we believe that only one kind of peace is possible, that is, the peace of disarmament, because armed peace is only a rest within the gaps between wars, which approves of war in principle and practice.</p>
<h3 id="e39">The Soviet Union's Disarmament Proposal: Unfortunately Opposed by Various Countries <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>The Soviet delegation once put forward a proposal for complete and universal disarmament. If this proposal had been accepted, then the divergent opinions on defensive weapons and offensive weapons, etc., at the conference would have disappeared, and from then on, the unfortunate political events that have occurred in various countries, as well as the deepening phenomena of nationalism, patriotism, and militarism, would have disappeared. At the same time, it would have an impact on the international economic situation. Therefore, I firmly believe that if the people of various countries (who previously had a greater influence on the policies of their respective governments) could similarly illuminate the development of international political life from the beginning, then they would never have allowed the conference to dare to despise the Soviet Union's proposal for complete disarmament in this way. Unfortunately, other delegations (I believe Turkey is an exception) opposed our proposal.</p>
<p>Up to now, we increasingly believe that once all countries resume their concept of relying on disarmament to avoid war through international methods, they must reflect on the Soviet Union's proposal for complete disarmament and carefully consider it, because there is no other guarantee of peace as long as the social and economic systems of non-Soviet countries exist today. When the Soviet delegation previously put forward this proposal, it did not take the form of a final ultimatum. On the contrary, the Soviet delegation expressed its willingness to cooperate with other delegations to create a system of partial reduction of armaments, and at the same time expressed that it would consider any kind and any form of armaments that could be applied to reduce.</p>
<p>To this day, there is no consistent opinion on the methods, principles, and regulations for reducing armaments. At the same time, there is no unified and established view on whether the so-called reduction should be applied to various forms of armaments (land, sea, and air forces). Although we do not list various complex opinions, we know that no problem has a concrete decision, and even a theoretical formula that can be agreed upon by the delegations is lacking."</p>
<h3 id="e40">National Policy is Strictly Enforced: Only Territorial Expansion is the Goal <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Litvinov continued, "Political events did not wait for the end of the Geneva rhetoric. Within some countries, the government has changed, the ruling party has changed, and the consciousness of the party and the government has changed. The methods for solving international problems are no longer as they were in the past. Although all countries have accepted the Briand-Kellogg Pact, what we can witness is the strict enforcement of national policies. Its implementation is through the development of military actions in neighboring countries. Other countries, whose strength is insufficient to implement the same policies, are only afraid of not striving for the idea of ​​expanding with force and occupying foreign territories. The leaders of these countries have publicly announced their plans to occupy foreign territories, and the current issue is how to deal with these countries.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Negotiations Have Achieved Nothing: Revealing the Complete Failure of Disarmament <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>After summarizing the achievements of the conference over the past two years, we must publicly point out that the difficulties that were revealed at the beginning of the establishment of the conference have not weakened during this period. On the contrary, they have strengthened their tone and ultimately forced us into a desperate situation.)</p>
<p>Litvinov further discussed the informal negotiations held by some countries. As a result, no agreement was formed. Litvinov continued, "We have discerned the meaning of the statements made by certain two countries (neither of which are small countries, nor have they been harmed by their love of peace). They absolutely cannot agree to any method of reducing armaments. From this, they have demonstrated their firm spirit of aggression. These statements are sufficient to indicate the complete failure of the conference (in terms of its disarmament mission) and more than enough. Some delegations may suggest that the conference should be satisfied with the following half-step, such as re-establishing the prohibition of chemical warfare as an international obligation (which has already been passed), or re-establishing that armaments cannot be expanded further at the current level. However, in the current situation, who can believe that these obligations will actually be respected by all countries and that there can be practical control in practice? If we can be honest and open at this time and confess that international life, especially the political situation of some countries in recent years, has not allowed the conference to complete its direct task of drafting a disarmament treaty, would it not be more honest politically?"</p>
<h3 id="e42">Dissolution is Indeed the Right Conclusion: Seeking Ways to Guarantee Security <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Litvinov continued, "The conference must be dissolved. This conclusion is followed up. If we deal with this issue purely from a formal and rigid point of view, that is, only keeping the name of the conference firmly in mind, then this conclusion is correct. However, the Soviet delegation continues to hold a broader view, believing that the conference has achieved its own purpose, which is none other than to realize a guarantee of peace through the method of disarmament. Therefore, the problem we are encountering is not only the problem of disarmament as a method, but also the problem of peace guarantee itself.</p>
<p>(Then a question arises, can the conference find other guarantees of peace for those countries that have no aggressive ideas, have no intention of war, and are targets of aggression once war breaks out, or at least limit and increase their security? We can ask, what kind of guarantee in the world can make the conference have greater consistency in its opinions on other issues than the previous issue of disarmament? And from this, make the new activities of the conference more effective and more successful? I dare to answer this question, in order to reduce armaments to a considerable extent, it is necessary to actually obtain the absolute agreement of all countries. The conference must do its best to make all countries comply with these programs, but even if some countries cannot agree, it must never prevent other countries from engaging in closer cooperation to implement these programs and enhance their own security.)</p>
<h3 id="e43">Supporting the Definition of Aggression: Sanction Steps Will Be Easier to Implement <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Litvinov continued, "(The issue of security has been an old topic of this conference, and the conference has even established a special committee to deal with such issues.)" Litvinov then recounted the Soviet Union's proposal to define aggressive behavior, pointing out that "If those who support the definition of Soviet Union's aggressive behavior can continue to increase, then other proposals regarding security proposed at the conference can be more easily implemented. Similarly, new proposals can also be put forward, such as the proposal to impose sanctions on those who undermine peace or violate the Kellogg-Briand Pact. We can create various sanction methods without taking military steps, because the latter cannot be applied to all countries. On top of these somewhat universal conventions, we can add various regional conventions for mutual assistance, but this does not include military alliances or dividing countries into opposing camps, nor does it include steps to surround a certain country. The principle that all countries have equal rights without exception will never cause any doubts or hesitations under this kind of security step. Among us, some believe that the word (security) contradicts (disarmament), but in my humble opinion, there is no other way to find other expressions for the concept of (security) besides this. (If we can follow this path, then the time and energy spent at the conference will not be wasted, and we will not return empty-handed when we see the people who sent us here. The tendency of security and strength to consolidate can be understood by aggressive governments) or create such conditions, so that the issue of disarmament can be put back on the agenda, and there can be a better chance of success.)"</p>
<h3 id="e44">Renamed Peace Conference: The League of Nations Still Retains its Privileges <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Litvinov further stated, "I absolutely do not want to limit the time and tasks of the conference. I respectfully suggest that the conference be changed into a permanent institution, which can provide the greatest possible concern for the guarantee of the security of all countries and the guarantee of world peace. In other words, my suggestion is to turn the conference into a permanent and regularly held peace conference to avoid the threat of war and its tragic consequences. The conference I am suggesting must create methods to consolidate security and complete it, issue timely signals for future war crises, and if countries feeling threatened make a request, they must approve it and provide appropriate assistance to them in a timely manner in terms of morality, economy, finance, and other aspects.)</p>
<p>Litvinov further stated that some opponents might say that the scope of what the League of Nations must engage in is not the same as what has been mentioned above. Litvinov then stated, "The tasks of the League of Nations are indeed too many, and it is also bound by the covenant. The paths to approach the League of Nations and obtain resolutions are greatly restricted by regulations. At the same time, the podium of the League of Nations can actually make it easier to step into a more free, and more attention is paid to the needs of the time. We let the conference be an organ of the League of Nations and be controlled by the League of Nations. We let the League of Nations maintain its original state, without making changes and completely maintaining its privileges. We want to establish another international organization outside the League of Nations and compete with the League of Nations? I have fully understood the difficulties. I will never make this suggestion. However, the convocation of the International Disarmament Conference has already shown the League of Nations' insufficient scope of activities for this great task of adding disarmament. My suggestion proposes a greater task, namely the permanent guarantee of peace. As far as I know, there is really no other way."</p>

<p>The Soviet government is quite proud of the security measures it has taken in recent years. These measures have had the most remarkable results in Eastern Europe, which is the region of greatest concern to the Soviet Union. Through the Convention Defining Aggression, the Non-Aggression Pact, and extending these conventions to the greatest possible extent, the Soviet Union has been able to strengthen mutual trust among the majority of its neighbors and increase their sense of security. The Soviet Union has created a new convention and declaration, that is, a convention and declaration that powerful countries can guarantee the independence of weak countries that are located between them or near them. I hope that this kind of convention and declaration will be widely adopted in the future.</p>

<p>(The Soviet government's cause has not always been successful. It has not always received a response from the other party accepting its statement. However, even in these circumstances, the Soviet Union's proposal can still promote peace, because they can help point out where the actions that undermine peace can occur.) Litvinov concluded, "The Soviet government is willing to exert a slight effort to implement greater steps to guarantee world peace. This kind of cooperation with any international cause and any international organization will surely demonstrate the great moral strength of this ever-growing, strengthening, and powerful country with 170 million people. This powerful country has actually broken away from the past policy of military annexation, and its newborn sixteen years have shown a large amount of evidence of its love of peace." (TASS, 30th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) At a meeting of the League of Nations Opium Advisory Committee today, American representative Fuller stated that opium and other dangerous drugs are greatly increasing in the three northeastern provinces, Rehe, Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu. According to Chinese government estimates, the total opium production in 1930 reached 12,000 tons. In 1933, China's opium production was seven times more than the total production in all other places in the world. Currently, opium smugglers are especially active in the three northeastern provinces and Rehe. Fuller also suggested that the League of Nations send an inspection committee to inspect various provinces in China and the three northeastern provinces and Rehe. (Central News Agency, 29th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Chinese Minister to Switzerland Hu Shih-tse responded to the accusations of American representative Fowler at a resumed meeting of the Opium Advisory Committee today, saying that the Chinese situation has become more and more serious recently. It is unfortunate that he was unable to record the progress in the situation. However, China is determined to continue fighting and welcomes the technical assistance in the suggestion. It must be known that China suffers far more from foreign toxins secretly smuggled into its territory than other countries suffer from Chinese opium. He put forward two methods: (1) The great powers must not protect their people who are engaged in illegal trade; (2) Find ways to ban foreign ships engaged in illegal trade along the coast and rivers. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) At the meeting of the Opium Advisory Committee, the representatives of various countries deeply acknowledged the seriousness of China's opium and other drug problems, and had the intention of making the Chinese government aware of the seriousness of the matter. They paid special attention to the secret manufacture of morphine and heroin in various parts of China. Spanish representative Quesada proposed that the Chinese government should quickly conclude the opium drug investigation that began a year ago, and report the results to the League of Nations as soon as possible. The motion stated that "The increasing seriousness of China's drug problem is sufficient to endanger the lives of the Chinese people, and to have a major impact on national economic development, political unity, and rural revitalization. At the same time, it will also seriously harm other countries." Also, American representative Fuller declared yesterday that the governments of various countries should take special measures to control certain chemicals specifically used for the manufacture of heroin. The quantity of these chemicals arriving in Shanghai is sufficient to manufacture up to one and a half tons of heroin per month. Quesada suggested that the same steps should also be taken to control the caffeine added to heroin pills. Our representative Hu Shih-tse put forward a motion that all foreigners who illegally manufacture or transport drugs in China should be deported back to their home countries and should not be allowed to come to China again in the future. Foreign ships traveling in the mainland that transport drugs should have their special permission to fly the foreign flag revoked. The motion is scheduled to be put to a vote tomorrow. It is expected that it can be passed without any major modifications. (Central News Agency, 30th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) People here familiar with the Chinese situation generally believe that the Chinese government's taking decisive steps cannot be delayed any longer. It has been repeatedly proposed here that the Chinese government should use customs and postal agencies to assist the authorities in preventing opium. Although the Opium Advisory Committee has repeatedly mentioned the situation of the poison spreading outside the Guan, and later our representative Hu Shih-tse also pointed out that the opium situation in the three northeastern provinces is serious, the Japanese representative has remained silent throughout and has not spoken.

<p>(New York) Admiral Standley today strongly advocated expanding the Navy to the limits allowed by treaties, and particularly emphasized the importance of frontline battleships. Standley is currently in New York arranging matters for the President's review of the Navy. Standley declared that if an enemy were to attack the United States by land, sea, and air, the enemy's first action would be to cross the ocean by ship. Therefore, the American fleet must be prepared to defend the nation at all times. A strong fleet is composed of various battleships and aircraft carriers, but battleships are the backbone of the fleet. Battleships are the fortress of maritime power, and only battleships can respond sensitively. Other ships or aircraft carriers do not have the ability to operate freely on the sea like battleships. Many old ships in the American fleet must be replaced with new ships to strengthen national defense. Naval experts and observers attach great importance to Standley's remarks, as the disarmament conference is uncertain, and Britain will also demand a reduction in the size of battleships at the future naval disarmament conference. Admiral Standley is currently the Commander of Naval Operations and is one of the world's leading naval experts, and may play an important role behind the scenes at the naval conference. The United States has few naval bases, and many are isolated from the mainland. Moreover, the United States has a very long coastline, and all its territories are isolated overseas, so there is a great need for large cruisers. However, Japan and Britain are eager to reduce the tonnage of large warships. (30th National Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance previously needed large funds during the Fujian Incident and borrowed 44 million yuan from 16 banks in Shanghai, including the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, using all of the Boxer Indemnity funds as collateral. A contract was signed on January 27, and Article 11 stipulated that the syndicate could issue securities worth 30 million yuan at one time. Now, the Ministry of Finance believes that the banks' funds are already tight during the silk and tea market season, but this year, due to the decline in international trade, the demand for funds is not high, and the funds are still very loose. Therefore, there is no need to issue this public debt. It has been agreed with the syndicate to transfer the public debt planned to be issued by the banks to the Ministry of Finance for issuance. The Ministry of Finance believes that the Shanghai banking community has unanimously approved the issuance by the Ministry of Finance. However, the Ministry of Finance will acknowledge and subsidize the various losses incurred by the syndicate during the preparation. The securities will be issued within this month, and the issued securities will be sold to the syndicate, and the banks can still use them as cash collateral or for trading.

<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan held a review meeting on the revised cigarette consolidated tax rate bill on the morning of the 31st. Representatives from the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance went to present their views. The Legislative Yuan stated that the current two-tiered cigarette consolidated tax rate is too simple. Goods of different prices are taxed at the same rate, causing domestic cigarette factories to be oppressed by foreign merchants. It would be best to classify domestic cigarettes and assess taxes based on their grade, in addition to the factory tax. Otherwise, the intention to encourage domestic goods should be specially indicated in the ad valorem or specific tax. Wei Tingsheng's investigation results were also presented for discussion. The Ministry of Finance representatives stated that too many grades would be difficult, but they agreed to carefully consider revising the factory tax to encourage and protect domestic products. No final decision was made at the time, and further discussions will be held next week. (31st Special Telegram)</p>

<p>Request to Demarcate Thirteen Counties for Defense by the Righteous Army</p>
<p>Japanese and Puppets Fear Heightened Popular Sentiment, Agree to Three Counties</p>
<p>Harbin dispatch: The counties near Yilan, Jilin, were previously the scene of popular uprisings sparked by the Japanese army's oppression in confiscating firearms and seizing land. Xie Wendong's suicide of his entire family to rally the righteous army marked the beginning. His call to action resonated widely, leading to even more tragic and heroic acts. Over ten high school graduates from Harbin, before resolving to sacrifice themselves in resistance against Japan, first asked their parents to find a way to survive on their own. Dressed in mourning clothes and hats, they knelt before their parents, lamenting the unbearable oppression of the violent Japanese and seeking to avoid mutual destruction. If elderly individuals still clung to their remaining years and were unwilling to take their own lives, they agreed on a cruel method of exchanging roles to kill each other's parents. The Zhang family members killed the Wang family's parents, while the Wang family members killed the Zhang family's parents, either with poison or gunfire, in various ways. After resolving matters with each other, they then killed their wives and children before swearing an oath to the heavens to fight the Japanese army to the death. No fewer than ten such tragedies occurred. As a result, their solidarity became stronger, gathering over 30,000 people. The Japanese and puppet forces mobilized their army, navy, and air force in joint operations, repeatedly pursuing and attacking them without success and suffering great losses. Now, the Japanese and puppets, recognizing that popular sentiment cannot be violated, have changed their tactics. They instigated Wang, a staff officer in Yu Nichen's conscription department, to go and persuade the righteous army to surrender. The righteous army, aware of the Japanese and puppets' plot, made extremely harsh demands. They demanded that thirteen counties in eastern Jilin, including Yilan, Huachuan, and Boli, be designated as the sphere of influence of the righteous army, declaring it as Chinese territory. Furthermore, Japanese and puppet officials and troops would not be allowed to operate within these twelve counties. The Japanese and puppet side only agreed to designate Yilan, Huachuan, and Boli counties as the sphere of influence of the righteous army. It is reported that the two sides are still continuing negotiations. (Northeast News Agency)</p>

<p>Painful Account of the Devastation Suffered by the People of Yilan</p>
<p>Please Report to the League of Nations to Appeal on Behalf of the People</p>
<p>General Li Du, in a telegram to Gu Shaochuan on May 19th, stated: "To Honorable Mr. Gu Shaochuan, As the League of Nations convenes to discuss the Far East issue, you are striving to defend our nation's sovereignty and uphold justice for humanity on the international stage. I look up to your brilliance with profound admiration. Recently, the Japanese have intensified their brutality in the Northeast, such as (1) forcibly conscripting young men into the army, (2) confiscating the people's self-defense weapons, (3) revoking the people's land deeds, (4) massacring innocent youths, and (5) publicly selling opium. Intellectuals with any sense of national identity are not spared. The cruel policies of national subjugation and extermination have reached their extreme. Yet, they continue to deceive the international community in various ways in an attempt to mislead them. It is reported that Zhang Yuanliang, a representative of the people of Lin Yilan County, disguised himself and came to Shanghai to report that at 11:00 AM on March 10th, the Japanese implemented armed immigration in the Tulong Mountain area, 100 li southeast of the county. Many Koreans, accompanied by Japanese soldiers, forced local farmers to abandon their possessions, surrender their firearms and land deeds, and relocate immediately. A man named Luan, driven to despair, shot and killed his entire family of over twenty women and children and contacted 15,000 fellow villagers, who, in their rage, killed the Japanese military officer Iizuka and over 100 Japanese soldiers. The Japanese side dispatched a large number of troops to attack and used 45 aircraft to bomb the villages, intending to wipe them out. At the same time, similar incidents occurred in the neighboring counties of Boli and Huachuan. The leader of the uprising is Xie Dongshan, who has now made contact with Luan. The three counties have tens of thousands of armed farmers, holding strategic locations and confronting the Japanese army. However, their equipment is crude and outdated, and they fear that they will not be able to sustain the resistance in the end. If no appropriate solution is found, our compatriots in the Northeast will face annihilation. I implore you to publicize this tragic situation to the assembly so that the international community can understand the truth and the Japanese schemes will be exposed. I am choking with emotion as I write this telegram. Please take note. Respectfully, Li Du." (China United News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e111">Japanese Consulate in Xiamen Conducts Census of Registered Residents Intended to Move Taiwanese People into Fujian <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: The Japanese residents, Taiwanese, originally migrated from Southern Fujian, Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, etc. Therefore, the four million Taiwanese people now all speak the Xiamen dialect, and their customs are completely the same as those of Southern Fujian. For this reason, the Taiwanese who reside in Southern Fujian are the majority, especially with Xiamen as the center. The Japanese recently proposed to move Taiwanese people into Fujian, and their goal is in Southern Fujian and Xiamen City. The number of Taiwanese people in Xiamen has been gradually increasing recently. According to news from the Japanese consulate, there are more than 30,000 people. However, many came to Fujian without permits and have not registered with the Japanese consulate. The Japanese consulate recently ordered the Xiamen Taiwanese Association to assign Taiwanese people throughout the Xiamen Island, according to the regional cities of each Xiamen security self-government association, and divide into twenty-two districts to form Taiwanese security committees in each district and appoint security committee members in each district to manage the Taiwanese people within the district under the command of the Japanese Consul’s Office police chief, forming a strict and systematic organization. The first step is to investigate the household registration and personnel changes of Taiwanese people in each district. However, Taiwanese people who registered with the Japanese consulate upon arriving in Xiamen according to regulations only reached a little over 10,000 people as of recently, and there are still over 10,000 people who have not registered. The Japanese Consul recently actively organized Taiwanese people in Xiamen by issuing a letter from the Police Chief to the Taiwan Association, informing Taiwanese people residing in Xiamen to go to the Consulate to register and report within one month. The Taiwan Association and the Police Chief jointly issued a public announcement a few days ago, urging Taiwanese residing in Xiamen to go to the office to register. (May 28th)</p>

<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Zhu Shaoliang, Chairman of the Gansu Provincial Government and concurrently Director of Pacification for Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai Provinces, flew from Lanzhou to Jiangxi to meet with Chiang on May 24. He stayed in Xi'an on the same day and flew to Hankou on the 25th. On the morning of the 28th, at around 9 AM, he flew from Hankou to Jiangxi and arrived in Nanchang at 11 AM on the same day. The Reception Section of the General Affairs Office of the Headquarters sent people to the airport to welcome him. Zhu and his entourage stayed at the Great Hotel and reported to the Reception Section of the General Affairs Office of the Headquarters. Chiang is scheduled to meet with him on the 29th. It is said that Zhu's mission in Jiangxi is to report on the administrative situation in Gansu, the current military situation in the three provinces, the process of suppressing Sun Dianying, and the defense situation after the demobilization of the units that suppressed Sun. The following points will be discussed: (1) Request the central government to allocate funds to relieve the disaster victims in the Ningxia war zone and provide pacification. (2) Develop the Northwest, such as completing the Shaanxi-Gansu highway, constructing water conservancy projects, improving animal husbandry, and preventing and controlling veterinary diseases. Because Song Ziwen previously inspected the Northwest and established a complete plan, Zhu's arrival is to urge its early implementation. (3) Consolidate the construction and border defense of the Northwest. After obtaining substantial results, he will return to Gansu immediately.</p>
<p>Hu Zongnan also arrived in Jiangxi yesterday to meet with Chiang, reporting on the demobilization process after suppressing Sun, the defense of his units, and the situation of replenishment and training. Chiang praised him greatly.</p>
<p>He Jian, Chairman of Hunan and concurrently Commander-in-Chief of the Western Route of the Jiangxi-Guangdong-Fujian-Hunan-Hubei Bandit Suppression Army, arrived in the province on the train from Changsha via Hankou and the Nanchang-Xunpu Road on May 28. At around 2 PM in the afternoon, the train arrived at the Niuxing Station. Director Cai and Section Chief Wang of the Headquarters went to the station to welcome him. He stayed at the Garden Hotel. According to He, the mission of his visit is to report to Chairman Chiang on the bandit suppression situation on the border of Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan, and to request instructions on follow-up measures. He also said that the western route defense area is vast, covering 43 counties (from Suichuan along the west of the Gan River and east of Hunan to Chongtong in southern Hubei). The Red bandits have always been suppressed in this area and flee to that area, appearing and disappearing unpredictably. Because the military strength is limited, it is difficult to deploy forces to the fullest extent, so encirclement and suppression often encounter difficulties. Currently, the bandits in the western route defense area have been defeated and broken into smaller groups. The larger groups are still two in number: Xiao Ke and Cai Huiwen between Anfu, Yongxin, and Lianhua; and Gao Yongsheng between Xiushui, Tonggu, and Chongtong on the border of Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan. It is feared that it will take some effort to suppress them. As for the scattered bandits in the four villages of other counties, political and military forces must arrive together to be effective. The Jiangxi-Hunan border highway has either been completed or is under active construction. Although the Jiangxi militia cannot be compared with Hunan at this time, the Hunan militia has spent five or six years to organize. Therefore, the training of the militia is even more difficult than the army. When asked about the rumors that the main force of Zhu and Mao on the border of Jiangxi and Fujian was surrounded and would cross the Gan River from Xingguo and Wan'an to flee to the border of Hunan, He replied that based on the current military situation of bandit suppression, he could guarantee that the Red bandits would not take this move.

<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: A run on paper currency suddenly occurred in Guangxi Province a month ago and has not been fully resolved yet. Recently, Wuzhou City has banned the export of cash to maintain finance. The garrison army stationed in Wuzhou convened a meeting of various agencies yesterday to discuss maintenance measures. Everyone believed that there were recently criminals in Wuzhou City making rumors (rumors that Bai Chongxi was assassinated in Guangxi) in an attempt to disrupt finance, and even some unscrupulous merchants went to various places to collect Guilin paper currency and take it to the bank for redemption to seek profit, resulting in another run on the bank. If this continues and is not suppressed, not only will finance be disrupted, but it will also affect security. They immediately agreed on suppression measures: the export of cash in Wuzhou is limited to 50 yuan, and the 19th Division Headquarters stationed in Wuzhou will issue inspection certificates and send inspectors to the east, west, north, and south and other places such as Xiaguan Jiangjun Bridge to conduct inspections. If anyone carries cash exceeding the prescribed 50 yuan, it will be confiscated in full. (May 25th)</p>

<p>Several cases of opium trafficking have been solved in Songjiang recently. For example, on the 26th, the chief of the water police detachment, Hu Tu, seized more than 180 packages of Sichuan-Yunnan opium carried by Chen Changgui at the bus station. An invoice was found, bearing the words "Hao Xicheng received from Zhang Baoji." Shen Jinyun, the captain of the Criminal Investigation Team of the Public Security Bureau, interceded with Hu, who refused, and the case was transferred to the court. Hao was sentenced to six months in prison and fined 1,000 yuan. It was rumored that the captain was suspected of protecting opium traffickers, which could not be denied. Moreover, theft cases have occurred frequently, but no cases have been solved, which has caused dissatisfaction with the authorities. Yesterday, Director Zhou issued an order to dismiss him and investigate. The position has been handed over to the successor today, but the candidate has not yet been determined. Yesterday, a man named Shi Ruishou, dressed in opium attire, was carrying more than 190 taels of opium. He was traveling by car and saw a police patrolman on the road at Pingqiao. He quickly hid the package behind his seat. The police officer, Xu Guoliang, found his behavior suspicious and ordered a search. The evidence and witnesses were obtained, and he was sent to the bureau for interrogation and then transferred to the procuratorate for investigation.</p>

<p>Wu Meiting, an apprentice at the Songcheng Zhou Pharmacy, suddenly contracted meningitis a few days ago. The condition was very serious, and he was rushed to Songjiang Hospital for treatment. Director Zhang Shaoxiu immediately used a needle to draw and test the spinal cord. The marrow had turned green, and it seemed to have festered. There was little hope of saving him. However, Director Zhang still tried to inject medicine. The patient fell into a coma yesterday and was unconscious. However, the general public was quite satisfied with Director Zhang's sincere treatment. A few days ago, the county government reported to Director Zhang that meningitis was about to disappear, but epidemic prevention should be carried out in advance. Therefore, County Magistrate Jin submitted it to the 15th Political Affairs Conference yesterday as a case of how to prevent epidemics from occurring in the summer. It was resolved to be handed over to Songjiang Hospital, the Public Security Bureau, and the First District Office for discussion of prevention measures and submission for approval.</p>

<p>There have been frequent incidents of throwing manure in Suzhou recently. For example, Shi Tingpan, the former manager of the Suzhou Grand Theater, and Zhu Qingyun, the editor of the Da Guangming, were both retaliated against by being hit with manure because they had offended others on weekdays. Now, Ren Tianjing, the assistant manager of the Suzhou Grand Theater, was walking near the Huayuan Hotel on Xinmin Bridge at night on the 30th when someone used a hat to scoop up a full load of manure and poured it on his head while he was unprepared. His face was covered in filth, and the stench was overwhelming. The manure thrower left as soon as the purpose was achieved. Ren immediately reported to the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau to request an investigation. On the other hand, he grabbed Gong Jingchu, the editor of the Gongshang Daily, near Duck Egg Bridge, forcibly accusing him of throwing the manure, and immediately took him to the Third Branch. Later, Xu and Li and others came forward to mediate and resolve the matter peacefully. It is said that the reason for the manure throwing was due to a question of impropriety.</p>

<p>The members of the Wujiang County Money Industry Association held a standing committee meeting on May 28th in Tongli. They saw that the rural economy was collapsing, industry and commerce were declining, and the impact on the interior was even greater. Money shops are the general hub of finance, and their responsibility is to regulate and adjust, which is their unavoidable duty. However, in this unfavorable situation, money shops themselves must also help each other to consolidate the financial foundation in order to have sufficient power to regulate the society. Therefore, at the meeting, it was resolved to organize a reserve bank for members of the same industry. It is said that the site of the bank will be temporarily attached to the Changfeng Zhuang, and Lu Yousheng, the manager of Jinfeng, was elected as the director, and Jin Jingfu, the manager of Tongyi, was elected as the deputy director. The total amount of reserve funds paid is 60,000 yuan. Anjiu Yu and the two Zhuang in Luxu each contributed 10,000 yuan. Xieji Zhuang, a member of the Luli, contributed 10,000 yuan, and Jinfeng, Tongyi, and Changfeng, the three members of Tongli, each contributed 10,000 yuan. The funds will be fully collected soon and officially established.</p>

<p>The Cocoon Industry Association of this county convened a general meeting of members at 2 pm on the previous day (30th), chaired by Hua Shaochun. First, the chairman reported on the issue of cocoon trade control. The association requested the authorities to consider and accommodate the three points: (1) Regarding the timing issue, the opening of the spring cocoon business this year is imminent, and there is not enough time for drawing lots, so we have to request a postponement. As for the construction of improved mechanical new stoves, we have to wait until next year. (2) Please do not collect improvement fees for the cocoon drying business. (3) The security deposit of 12 yuan per load is changed to 3 yuan per load. The association repeatedly argued for the above three requirements and asked the authorities to approve them. Then, discussions began, and it was resolved that (1) the cocoon trade house donation will still be collected by the association. (2) The stamp tax will be handled in accordance with the association's old plan. (3) The business tax was contracted by the association for 4,000 yuan last year, and this year, please ask the business tax bureau to collect it directly from the cocoon trade. (4) Cocoon trade houses that fail the grade and cocoon trade houses that have not been opened for two years and have less than four stoves that have a valid cocoon license should be opened as usual. As for the security deposit of 12 yuan, it is difficult to pay. The improvement fee of 3 yuan per load will be paid when the dry cocoons of each line are on the shelves, and the line license will be submitted to the county for review and registration first. The above points will be discussed again by the chairman with the authorities and reasonably negotiated. (5) The improved seed cocoon price is 25 yuan per load as the high price, and the local seed price is 20 yuan per load as the standard. (6) It was decided that the cocoon trade will open uniformly on June 4th. After the discussion, the meeting adjourned. Yesterday, more than 20 cocoon trade houses were reported to be opened, including Yu Changyong in Baishiqiao and Zhenxiangtai in Ge Diqiao. In addition, Zhang Guifang, the captain of the 9th Team of the 2nd District of the Water Police, went to the Cocoon Industry Association with Inspector Xiang Wengui yesterday to discuss the issue of protecting the cocoon market.</p>

<p>In District 6, Map 18, Chen Douban Alley, resident Feng Chunquan, aged 45, has a son named Fogeng, aged 26. Since childhood, Fogeng was betrothed to Yin Apan, a woman from nearby Hexi. Yin came to live with them as a child bride at the age of six and is now 28, having already given birth to two sons and one daughter. Chunquan works as a temple keeper at the Zhang Xun Temple in Tangtou Township, while Fogeng used to collect tickets at the Paris Theater in the city. Yin, feeling lonely due to her husband's frequent absences, engaged in a clandestine affair with her father-in-law, Chunquan, resulting in incest. Recently, she became pregnant, being more than three months along. Fearing that her husband would find out, causing a loss of face, Yin hired a midwife to perform an abortion. However, after the procedure, she suddenly suffered excruciating abdominal pain and became bedridden.

The purpose of the China Construction Bank Corporation is to connect domestic banks and overseas financial circles to provide assistance and coordination for public or private enterprises in order to seek the development of industry and commerce, and to focus on the continuous supply of large capitalists. The company specializes in researching any enterprise with new plans, and for those deemed qualified, it will find ways to raise capital from China and abroad, and may act as a supervisor on behalf of investors.</p>
<h3 id="e131">The Promoters <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>

<h3 id="e133">Yesterday's Meeting <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The company held a promoters' meeting at 11:00 AM yesterday at its head office at No. 7 Hankou Road. Those present included Kong Xiangxi, Song Ziwen, Song Wenliang, Bei Songsun, Zhang Weiru, Chen Guangfu, Xu Keting, Ye Fuxiao, Tang Shoumin, Xie Zuokai, Liu Huizhi, Wu Qiding, Xu Xinliu, and Xu Busun, Qian Yongming, etc. Lawyer Yao Yongli was present as an observer.

<h3 id="e134">Organizational Nature <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>According to a promoter, the nature and mission of the company are as follows: China's finance has changed considerably in the past 20 years, because China's banking industry has progressed with the times, enabling domestic and overseas Chinese capital to accumulate and concentrate on China's revitalization plan. It is possible to use the above-mentioned economic development to make cooperation between Chinese and foreign capital possible. Moreover, if this capital can obtain considerable guarantees, it can naturally be supplied for national economic construction. In recent years, although various new enterprises have been formed by Chinese banks and foreign businesses, there is still a lack of a mechanism that enables cooperation between various banks and foreign businesses. This is the origin of the establishment of the China Construction Bank Corporation in the midst of China's economic construction, which means that it has arisen in response to the demands of the times. Because the company's nature is not an investment trust company, the amount of capital raised is not important. According to the precedent of financial organizations, the company can exert its function whenever there is a considerable opportunity to assist China's business enterprises. The company has no intention of directly incorporating foreign capital into the company now or in the future. However, the company takes an open attitude. If there is considerable foreign capital for enterprises, it can cooperate with Chinese investors and the company, or the company can invest in various enterprises on its behalf. Because the company represents the most stable force in China, it is firmly believed that foreign businessmen who are willing to invest in China will be willing to cooperate with the company. The company is a purely commercial institution. Following Dr. Sun Yat-Sen's instructions, it recognizes the use of foreign capital as legitimate cooperation for the development of China's resources and the benefit of mankind. In this spirit of cooperation, regardless of whether it is at home or abroad, it does not involve politics, does not hold prejudices, and takes supporting China's economic construction as its own responsibility. This is also the company's grand vision.</p>

<p>In order to complete the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, the Ministry of Railways, with the Boxer Indemnity as collateral, in conjunction with the Ministry of Finance, is issuing 1.5 million pounds of the Republic of China's 6% British Gold Boxer Indemnity Bonds today, underwritten by four banks including Bank of China and HSBC, and marketed domestically and internationally. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Commencement of Issuance: The Republic of China's 6% British Gold Boxer Indemnity Bonds, with a total amount of 1.5 million pounds, are scheduled to begin issuance today. Principal will be repaid from January 1, 1935, and thereafter every six months. The British Boxer Indemnity borrowed by the Ministry of Railways is designated as the fund, and will be submitted to the designated four banks, including the Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and HSBC, for storage on schedule for payment. The fund will be managed by the fund management committee composed of the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Railways, the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board of Trustees, the Audit Department, and the underwriting bank. The bonds are divided into three types: 50 pounds, 100 pounds, and 1,000 pounds.</p>
<p>Four Banks Underwrite: A reporter from the New Sound Agency learned from Shanghai banking circles yesterday that after the issuance of the 6% British Gold Boxer Indemnity Bonds, they will be underwritten by four banks: the Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and HSBC. It has been decided that the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Communications Bank will be responsible for domestic sales, while HSBC will be responsible for international sales. The total amount of these bonds is 1.5 million pounds. It is expected that the international sales performance will be very good, because the interest rate on foreign government bonds is 3% to 5%, while the interest rate on these bonds is 6%, which is higher than that of foreign bonds. Moreover, the collateral is the British Boxer Indemnity, which is very reliable.</p>

<p>Regarding the issue of through traffic in North China, Yin Tong, Director of the Beijing-Nanjing Railway Bureau, came to Shanghai to meet with Huang Fu, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Committee, to discuss everything. Yin took the night train to Beijing on the evening of the 28th to pay respects to Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan, and Gu Mengyu, Minister of Railways. Through traffic is expected to be implemented in mid-June. Tang Youren, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, arrived in Shanghai by night train from Beijing yesterday morning to fulfill his mission. He drove to meet Huang Fu at 9:30 AM yesterday morning and had a confidential talk that lasted for more than an hour before taking his leave. The details of the consultations on North China's diplomatic issues were very detailed. In addition, Huang Fu issued a written statement the day before yesterday, stating that recent reports indicated that Japanese Ambassador Arima will arrive in Shanghai soon and will hold negotiations with Chairman Huang Fu in Shanghai. The matter regarding the resumption of business of Huie Bank has also become a topic of discussion. As this matter is of great importance, the reporter made a special visit. The conversation is published as follows: (Question) Is it true that Japanese Ambassador Arima will arrive in Shanghai soon and will hold negotiations with you in Shanghai? (Answer) If Ambassador Arima comes to China and I happen to be in Shanghai, private socializing may be unavoidable. However, as the ambassador represents his country, any matters of negotiation will naturally be handled with the central government. (Question) What are your opinions on the reports of local solutions? (Answer) I have never advocated this from the beginning. Last year, when Tianjin and Peking were in a state of emergency, I assisted the military authorities at the front under the direction of the central government and signed the Tanggu Truce Agreement. Currently, in addition to the follow-up matters of the agreement, there have been no local solutions. I have stated this repeatedly before. (Question) What is your opinion on the recent reports regarding the resumption of business of Huie Bank? (Answer) I have been stationed in North China for more than a year and have been in a state of constant crisis and shock. I have not had time to attend to economic matters. I only became aware of this issue recently after seeing the news reports and am currently inquiring about it.</p>

Our factory was established in the ninth year of the Republic of China. We use new machines and domestic silk to improve weaving. All of our products have always been popular with the Chinese people. This time, the Lama is concerned about the industry during his visit to Shanghai, and we hope to have some guidance and promote it. After speaking, he presented a specially made yellow beauty crepe. Then the Lama replied, saying that he was very pleased to hear that the daily necessities used by the Chinese people are now all made in China. Tibet also produces silk and satin, but they are also in decline because the weaving process has not been improved. Your factory's products are excellent and should be promoted. The Lama also personally inscribed a Tibetan blessing, which means "Three Treasures, More Fortune, Auspiciousness and Good Luck." Then Mr. Cai led him to visit various departments and took photos as a memento. The Lama left and visited the Yabu Er Electric Plant, and went to Yan Fuqing's banquet in Ye Garden in Jiangwan in the evening.</p>

<h3 id="e152">Japanese Envoy Arisima Arrived in Shanghai the Day Before Yesterday <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Japanese Minister to China, Arisima Akira, returned to his country last month to report on the situation in China to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and to seek instructions on future Sino-Japanese diplomatic policy. He has now completed his duties and arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday at 3:15 PM, accompanied by his wife, Counselor Motono, and Secretary Yokokawa, aboard the Japanese ship Nagasaki Maru. The ship docked at the Wayside Wharf. The Japanese minister disembarked around 4:00 PM and proceeded directly to his private residence on Bi Xun Road to rest. After the ship docked, more than one hundred Japanese officials and civilians in Shanghai, Wang Changchun, a commissioner from the Shanghai Municipal Government, and Chinese and Japanese journalists boarded the ship to meet him. The Japanese minister shook hands with the welcoming personnel in the ship's hall and then met with Chinese and Japanese journalists, stating,</p>
<p>"I (Arisima referring to himself) am unsure whether I will visit Huang Fu immediately after arriving in Shanghai, as I do not know if Mr. Huang is currently in Shanghai. The date of my entry to Beijing has not yet been decided. However, I may need to travel to Beijing in the near future to meet with Chinese diplomatic authorities. I have not yet considered whether to visit Chiang Kai-shek in Nanchang. In short, I have just returned to Shanghai and will decide after resting briefly."</p>
<p>Regarding Sino-Japanese diplomatic issues, he further stated that the rumors that he had brought instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on this trip were not true. He had not received any special instructions from the ministry. As for the so-called "Water Bird Diplomacy," he was unaware of it and did not know the source of the news reports. When reporters inquired about Japan's opinions on Chinese diplomacy, he responded that due to differences in observation, there were bound to be differences in opinion, but the overall policy towards China was consistent.</p>
<p>Regarding the issues of through traffic and through mail, the Japanese minister believed that the negotiation of these issues would be mainly conducted by the Kwantung Army and the North China local government. He had no knowledge of rumors that the through traffic issue had been resolved and that it would be handled by the International Travel Agency. As for the issue of settling Sino-Japanese debt, this was something that Japan hoped for, but the Japanese side had not made any special requests. The Japanese side currently had no special demands regarding the Sino-Japanese tariff issue, but he had heard that the Chinese government would automatically revise the Sino-Japanese tariff rates. The Japanese minister considered the rumors of direct Sino-Japanese negotiations difficult to explain. The Japanese minister further stated that Japan's policy towards China was always based on goodwill. Unfortunately, after the January 28th Incident, the feelings between the two countries deteriorated. During his recent return to his country, he observed that public sentiment in China had become more moderate than before. However, Minister Arisima declined to express any opinion on the informal declaration issued by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on April 17th.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent letters to the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, cotton cloth industry, woolen textile industry, dyeing and weaving industry trade associations, and the China General Cotton Mill Association, stating: "Esteemed Sirs, our Chamber has repeatedly received reports from patriotic supporters of national products stating that recently, several new types of piece goods have been discovered on the market: (1) the 'Qinu District' trademark, depicting a woman carrying a large flag, whose products are various rayon flosses; (2) the 'Three Ruyi' trademark, depicting three children, one child sitting high above, holding a ruyi in both hands, two children below, facing each other, four hands together holding a ruyi, four feet together dancing on a ruyi, whose products are small twills and colored cotton cloths; (3) the 'Yang Guifei' trademark, whose products are various colored twill cotton cloths; (4) the 'Three Joys' trademark, depicting three people in ancient attire, one leaning against a window holding a book, one leaning against bamboo admiring the scenery, one sitting on a rock, admiring plum blossoms, whose products are various woolen cloths; (5) the 'Ruifeng' trademark, with the roof and courtyard covered in snow, an old man and a young woman in ancient attire admiring the snow by the window, whose products are fine white cloths. The above-mentioned trademarks all feature Chinese characters and stories. Please verify whether they are national products." Our Chamber has found that the above-mentioned five trademarks do not indicate the place of origin, and the prices marked for each piece or yard do not state "several yuan and several jiao" but "several yuan and several tens of silver," clearly attempting to pass themselves off as national products, revealing a lack of awareness. To prevent patriotic supporters of national products from being deceived, we hereby request that you all be notified to pay attention to this matter. This is of utmost importance.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, a reporter interviewed Tao Baichuan, Director of the Military Law Department of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, yesterday to inquire about the implementation of the Provisional Regulations on Strict Prohibition of Potent Narcotics.

(Answer) The regulations stipulate that they will be implemented ten days after promulgation and delivery. They have now been implemented since the 27th of this month. (Question) What exactly are the so-called potent narcotics? (Answer) They refer to morphine, cocaine, and other compounds or combinations thereof, such as red and white colored pills. (Question) Will all cases involving potent narcotics be handled by the headquarters in the future? Can the courts in the concessions still handle them? (Answer) All cases involving these narcotics will be handled by this headquarters in accordance with the law. The courts in the concessions are also judicial organs of China and are no exception. It is heard that the Municipal Government has notified them in accordance with the order. (Question) Will crimes committed before the implementation of the regulations be punished in accordance with these regulations or still be handled in accordance with the Anti-Opium Law? (Answer) In accordance with the provisions of Article 2 of the Criminal Law, they should be sentenced in accordance with the Anti-Opium Law. According to the interpretation of the Judicial Yuan's Yuanzi No. 271 of the 19th year, they should be sentenced in accordance with the regulations. It has now been submitted to Chairman Chiang for approval, and all criminal acts discovered before the implementation of the regulations will be handled in accordance with the Anti-Opium Law, and the rest will be handled in accordance with the regulations. (Question) The regulations stipulate that manufacturing, selling, and transporting potent narcotics are punishable by death. If there were such crimes in the past, but they have now ceased, can they be treated leniently if discovered in the future? (Answer) It is best to surrender to the competent authority before being discovered, and then a commutation of sentence may be granted in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Shanghai County Begins Opium Suppression; Investigate and Report Details Within Ten Days; Confess and Quit Opium Use Within June <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government is actively carrying out opium suppression matters in the county. In addition to establishing the Opium Suppression Committee, it has ordered each district to investigate and report on opium smokers within their boundaries by June 30, so that they can be registered and issued licenses. The operational situation of the committee is investigated and recorded as follows: The organization of the committee naturally includes County Magistrate Pan Zhongjia, Public Security Bureau Xu Yuyin as committee members, and Zhang Jingye, a member of the County Party Department, Huang Yunchen, director of the Property Disposal Office, and Yao Huiquan, a local gentry, as appointed committee members. It also has a secretary and four sections including General Affairs, but due to funding issues, the positions are temporarily filled by the committee members and county government staff. Wei Xizhai, secretary of the county government, has been appointed as the secretary, the head of the first section of the county government has been appointed as the head of the General Affairs section, committee member Xu Yuyin has been appointed as the head of the Investigation section, Shen Zao, a member of the Public Security Bureau, has been appointed as the head of the Licensing section, and committee member Huang Yunchen has been appointed as the head of the Audit section. Other section members and secretaries have also been appointed as investigators and are not temporarily established. Furthermore, party and government service personnel and school staff who use opium are required to report and quit opium use within two weeks from June 1. Those who do not use opium are required to obtain a joint guarantee and submit it for verification. Whether there are any organizations manufacturing narcotic drugs within the territory has been ordered by the county government to the Public Security Bureau and various districts to investigate and report the details within ten days. At the same time, measures for those who use opium to confess themselves are being drafted and announced to confess and quit opium use from June 1 to June 30, and they will be exempted from punishment. In addition, the committee believes that the offenders who use drugs can be entrusted by the Zhenjiang Garrison Headquarters to the local county government for trial. Since this county does not also handle judicial affairs and has no prison facilities, it has reported the special circumstances of this county to the province for approval. In addition, in order to gather ideas and benefit from various opinions, the committee has decided to hold a joint opium suppression meeting on the Opium Suppression Memorial Day on June 3 to discuss everything. In addition, the number of local opium paste shops in the county is currently being investigated by the Public Security Bureau to determine the actual situation before further arrangements are made.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Cross-Border Road Construction; North District Telephone Fee Issue; Public Works Bureau to Find a Permanent Solution <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of telephone fees in the extraterritorial road area of the Public Concession, the Japanese Residents' Association recently raised an objection to the Public Works Bureau. According to the report of the Secretary General of the Public Works Bureau to the board of directors, this telephone fee is based on the agreement between the telephone company and the Shanghai Telephone Bureau in April of last year. At that time, the Public Works Bureau had carefully considered this matter. According to the agreement, users in the North District whose residences are adjacent to the extraterritorial roads pay an additional twelve yuan per year to the telephone bureau. Those who are not adjacent to the roads pay an additional sixty yuan. As for the West District, those who are more than one hundred yards away from the boundary line pay an additional thirty yuan per year. These conditions are actually the most favorable conditions that the company could obtain. The difference between the North District and the West District is that the telephone bureau already has telephone poles in the North District, which can supply users by itself. The additional telephone fee, within one year after the agreement, is paid by the telephone company on behalf of the users who pay special municipal donations. After one year has passed, the users should pay it themselves. The agreement can now be cancelled with three months' notice, but now it is being sought to revise and establish a permanent agreement.</p>
<p>According to a survey on May 16, there are approximately 836 Japanese residential houses in the area in the North District. 322 houses have paid the special municipal donation for this spring, and 514 houses have not yet paid.</p>
<p>After discussion at the board of directors meeting this Wednesday, the consensus is that the current conditions cannot be made more favorable. This intention should be used to respond to the Residents' Association, along with the letter from the company. However, it should also be expressed to the association that the Public Works Bureau and the company recognized yesterday that it is necessary to revise and establish a permanent and proper agreement. The Public Works Bureau will do its best to assist the company in its efforts in this regard.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously received a telegram from the Guangdong Miscellaneous Grain Association stating that Shanghai, Hankou, and Wuxi locally-made soybean cakes shipped to Guangdong Province were forcibly identified as imported from Shandong Province by the local tax contractors, resulting in the detention of as many as 18,200 pieces. They were required to pay taxes before being released. The Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association of this port requested the City Chamber of Commerce to telegram the Guangdong Provincial Government to strictly order the contractors to identify the origin of the soybean cakes, release them as soon as possible, and clearly delineate the boundaries of where taxes should be levied and where they should be exempted, so that they would not be detained indiscriminately in the future, so that the industry would not be destroyed. After deliberation by the Southwest Political Affairs Conference of the Guangdong Provincial Government, it was decided that Shanghai and Hankou domestically-produced soybean cakes shipped to Guangdong Province should be exempted from taxes, and those detained should be released immediately. The Guangdong Provincial Chamber of Commerce has been notified to inform the Miscellaneous Grain Association to check and comply, and at the same time, the contractors have been ordered to release the detained soybean cakes. The City Chamber of Commerce has also received a reply telegram from the Provincial Chamber of Commerce, informing the Miscellaneous Grain Association to ship locally-made soybean cakes to Guangdong as usual, so as to avoid unsalable goods.</p>

<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Emei ship, which was grounded on the Huatanzi near Fuzhou in the Chuan River in June of last year, has undergone ten months of rescue, with expenses reaching 110,000 yuan.

After some minor repairs, it sailed to Hankou and then to Shanghai. It entered the port at 11:00 AM yesterday. The ship is berthed at the Jin Liyuan Wharf. However, due to the considerable damage to the hull, it still needs to enter the dock for major repairs before it can resume its schedule. The company is now being realistic about the ship repair project, so the ship department has decided to hold a bidding process, with each shipyard offering a price for the repair, and the one with the lowest price will be commissioned. After the ship is repaired, it will still sail on the Chuan River and will not operate on the Beijing-Hankou express train.</p>

<p>The company previously had a Shuntian ship that operated on the North China route, namely between Shanghai and Tianjin. Because the ship was old and the hull was aging, it was no longer suitable in this competitive era. Therefore, a new ship was built at the Taikoo Dock in Hong Kong, named Shuntian. The tonnage and length of the ship are the same as those of the Shenjing ship, but the internal equipment and machine furnace are better than those of the Shenjing. It is 300 feet long, 46 feet wide, and 25 feet high, with a total tonnage of about 3,000 tons. It has two steam engines and boilers, and mechanical coal loading, with a (Blong Tish) rotary machine, a (Baibuke Cox) propulsion wheel, three cargo holds, and two-story cargo holds.

<p>According to the Ta Kung News Agency, the Municipal Farmers' Association was ordered by the Social Affairs Bureau to organize a New Life Movement Advisory Team in the agricultural sector. The Association's Executive Director Yu Zhenhui went to various districts to carry out preparations. The day before yesterday, when he went to the Gaohang District of Pudong to contact the matter, he passed through Shagang and saw that the gambling wind was very strong there. There were more than a dozen gambling tables and more than a hundred gamblers all making desperate bets. Mr. Yu witnessed this situation and believed that it violated the New Life Movement. He went forward to dissuade them, which led to a dispute. The gang guards of the Three District and Four Stations of the district brought both sides into the district station together. After the interrogating of the Inspector Que, instead of punishing the gamblers, he wanted to detain the Executive Director of the Farmers' Association, Yu Zhenhui. The affair was resolved through the mediation of Pan Mingding, Municipal Affairs Committee Member of the Gaohang District, and Su Shude, Supervisory Committee Member of the Fifth District Party Department. The day before yesterday (the 29th), the station chief, Zhan Chun, suddenly summoned the Executive Director to the case again, which aroused public outrage from the Party Departments and various groups in the Pudong and Wusong districts. They believed that the district station chief was protecting gamblers and obstructing the promotion of the New Life Movement. Therefore, yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, they convened a joint meeting and decided to jointly petition the Party and government agencies to dismiss the station chief and the inspector and severely punish them as a warning to others.</p>

<p>At No. 40, Shaonian Road, outside Xiaoximen, the Wu Hua Chang Machinery Factory, opened by Wu Lianqing, a native of Yuyao, has been in operation for many years and has been doing well. However, yesterday at around 5:00 AM, while boiling opium paste in the wooden room on the Jintai platform inside the factory, a spark fell to the floor, immediately causing a conflagration. Fortunately, the nearby patrol police noticed it and immediately reported it to the Western District Fire Brigade, which quickly dispatched fire trucks to the scene to exert all efforts to extinguish the fire. After about half an hour, the fire was put out, with only one room being burned. Afterwards, Zhang Quandong, the police chief of the San Guantang Police Station in the Second District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, went to investigate and took the fire starter Wu Lianqing, as well as a copper pot used for burning opium, back to the district for interrogation. Furthermore, at around 3:00 AM, Ling Quanfu, a local resident residing at No. 8, Wuliquiao, Xinqiao Road, in the Southern District, reported through his pig-raising partner, Tang Youlin from Jiangbei, that the thatched house built by the riverbank had been set on fire, causing it to burn and penetrate the roof. He was awakened from his sleep and fled for his life, reporting to the patrol police at the Liyuan Road branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, who immediately notified the fire brigades of various districts to dispatch fire trucks to the scene to extinguish the fire. It took about an hour to put out the fire. Subsequently, Police Chief Li Zhentu went to investigate the cause of the fire and brought Wu Lianqing back to the district for interrogation. It was also discovered that five thatched houses had been burned down, housing a total of nine households, with over thirty pigs, large and small, being burned to death, resulting in significant losses. In addition, the home of Wu Shifan, a native of Funing, in a thatched house without a number behind No. 507, Zhizaoju Road, in the Southern District, also experienced a fire yesterday at around 4:00 AM, due to a lack of caution.

The firefighters immediately extinguished the fire, but sixteen thatched houses were burned down. Subsequently, the police station took the fire starter Wu Shifan back to the district to handle the case together, it is said.</p>

<p>The Lao Gong Tai cake shop at No. 842 to 844, Tangshan Road, near the Baoding Road intersection, was in the process of closing and settling accounts at around 9:40 PM last night when suddenly three thugs dressed in short clothes arrived. Two of the thugs were armed with pistols, and one was armed with a sharp blade. They knocked on the door, and the shopkeeper, thinking they were customers, immediately opened the door and let them in. Unexpectedly, the three thieves, upon entering, immediately drew their pistols and blades, ordering everyone to be silent. They drove the shop employees into a small room in the back, assigning one thief to guard them, while the others entered the shop and opened the cash register, seizing ten silver dollars and ninety cents in small coins. However, the thieves were not satisfied and went upstairs to break into the bedrooms of the shop employees. As they were preparing to rummage through chests and boxes, one of the employees in the small room downstairs took advantage of the thieves' inattention and escaped through the back door, running to a nearby shop to make a phone call to the Huishan Police Station. The police station immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to the scene, first surrounding the front and back doors, and then knocking on the door and demanding entry. The thieves upstairs, hearing the sound, panicked and fled from the rooms, rushing towards the balcony at the back. One of the thieves jumped from the balcony, and seeing the detectives had arrived, opened fire to resist arrest. The two sides exchanged more than ten shots, and the thief was shot down on the spot by the detectives. The remaining thieves had already escaped. The wounded thief was taken to the hospital for treatment, while detectives were dispatched to search for the remaining thieves.</p>

<h3 id="e180">After Shi Jixiang's Tragic Death: Suspect Surrenders: Police Station Raises Suspicious Points: Dong Qing Tian Resolutely Denies <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Shi Jixiang, a native of Jiangbei, 45 years old, worked for a living. On May 2nd of this year, at 9:00 PM, while walking past the entrance of the Labor Hospital on Xiaoshadu Road in western Shanghai, he was suddenly attacked by thugs who splashed nitric acid, causing him serious injuries. He was taken to the hospital, but treatment was ineffective, and he died on the 10th. The perpetrator fled. The hospital reported the incident to the police station, which forwarded it to the First Special Court's Procuratorate for examination of the body, ordering it to be placed in a coffin and conducting a strict search for the perpetrator for questioning. This was reported in this newspaper. Now, Hua Detective Shi En of the Putuo Road Police Station, based on a report from the victim's family, said that the case was related to Dong Qingtian, a native of Yangzhou residing at No. 209, Robert Sheng Road. Dong used to be a worker at the Nissin Foreign Cotton Mill No. 12, No. 1416. His father, Mr. Dong, had a dispute with the deceased Shi Jixiang over land sales in the countryside of Yangzhou, accumulating a grudge. When Mr. Dong was dying, he told his son Dong Qingtian that he had died because of Shi and that he must avenge his father in the future. Dong agreed. Therefore, Dong is suspected of being heavily involved in Shi's death this time. Furthermore, it was found that the deceased had only been in Shanghai for three days, having just arrived from his hometown, and had no enemies. However, Dong repeatedly asked for leave from the factory after Shi was attacked. After the 10th, he did not come to work at the factory for a week. On the 24th, Dong suddenly sent someone to the factory, falsely claiming that Dong had died and requesting that wages be paid according to regulations. With all these clues, there was no doubt of suspicion. Therefore, the police station strictly investigated Dong. Dong Qingtian learned about the rumors and, in order to clarify the truth, surrendered himself to the Putuo Road Police Station at 10:30 AM yesterday, accompanied by his lawyer Song Shixiang, declaring that he was not related to Shi Jixiang's death. The police chief, stating that further investigation was needed, detained Dong. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police Station lawyer Gan Jingxian presented the above situation, requesting permission to detain him for further investigation. According to Detective Shi En's report on the investigation, Dong also had another point of suspicion in this case, namely that after the deceased was injured, a witness, Liu Xitang, passed by western Shanghai on a bicycle one day and suddenly saw three people talking along the way, saying, "This matter is terrible; if that person dies, it will be even more terrible." Liu immediately paid attention. One of the three people, whose face was facing outward, was the defendant Dong Qingtian. Witnesses Liu Xitang and Okada Hidefu of the Nissin Foreign Cotton Mill Nos. 1 and 2 are now available to testify. According to the statements of each witness, when questioned, the defendant Dong Qingtian refused to admit anything. Judge Xiao Xie Fen reviewed the confession and ordered Dong to be detained and rescheduled for further questioning.</p>

<p>Chen Huilan, a 24-year-old woman from Panyu, Guangdong, used to work as a teacher in a school and resided at No. 5, Zhifengli, Huanlong Road, in the French Concession. She has now moved to the upstairs of No. 333, Fuxu Road. Last year, she was introduced by a friend to Yang Weichen, a 30-year-old man from the same hometown, whose home is at No. 18, Lane 163, Maisai Er Di Luo Road. He is a painter in an oil painting company upstairs in the Dalu Commercial Building and earns a good monthly income. One is a modern woman, and the other is a Western-dressed young man. When they met, they greatly regretted not having met sooner. Every evening, they often frequented singing halls and dance halls. They went from friendship to marriage on December 2nd, getting married at the Xinghualou Restaurant on Fourth Horse Road. Unexpectedly, not long after the marriage, disagreements arose, and this spring, the two parties agreed to divorce, with a written agreement as proof. Unexpectedly, at 7:30 PM on the 25th of last month, the two parties encountered each other on Hualong Road. Yang Weichen immediately invited Chen Huilan to his residence, saying he had important matters to discuss. Chen, remembering their past affection, followed Yang to his residence on Mai Sai Er Di Luo Road. Unexpectedly, after a disagreement, Yang immediately became violent, beating Chen and tying her hands and feet. He also stripped off Chen's black wool Ge cheongsam and black leather shoes, imprisoning Chen in the room. Later, because Chen shouted loudly, the second wife, Wu Guoshi, went upstairs to dissuade him, and Chen was able to escape. She sought treatment at the Chaozhou Heji Hospital and reported the incident to the police station, ordering Detective Guo Bingquan to go and arrest Yang. He was sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special Court yesterday. First, the police station lawyer Chen Ming explained the case, saying that the defendant had committed the crimes of illegal detention and assault, requesting interrogation. Then, the plaintiff Chen Huilan stated that after the woman divorced Yang, she lived in two separate places. On the evening of May 25th, she encountered Yang on Hualong Road. Later, he falsely claimed to repay the woman's old debts and invited her to his home to collect the money. The woman believed it to be true and followed him. Upon arriving, he did not ask about the situation and beat her, requesting interrogation. When questioned, Yang Qingchen confessed that the names of himself and Chen Huilan as husband and wife were still in effect and had not been divorced. Because he had been out for a month without returning home for no reason, he happened to see her on this day, so he persuaded her to return home to live together. Unexpectedly, the plaintiff was barbaric after returning home, so he was angry and committed the assault. The matter was adjourned, and the defendant was released on bail. A summons was issued for the second landlord to appear as a witness at a later date.</p>

For a time, those who stopped to watch were crowded. Among the crowds, many were those with pigeon-shaped bodies and hunchbacks, silently reciting the notice. They were all frowning and looked worried. Some, when reading the words "death penalty," were even speechless and stood there like wooden chickens. It was also heard that the district chiefs of the Public Security Bureau, in view of the strictness of this prohibition order, had ordered the household registration section chiefs to be responsible for each section and exhort door-to-door, so as to avoid ignorant citizens from wrongly stepping into the legal net.</p>

<p>Li Xiaozhen, a 15-year-old woman from Funing, and Ji Xiaomei, an 18-year-old woman from Yangzhou, both work in a galoshes factory in Zhabei. Therefore, the two are very close and visit each other frequently. At around 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, Xiaozhen and Xiaomei, due to the hot weather, went together after work to Li Xiaozhen's house in a flat behind the Jiangjia Lane in Zhabei to bathe. Unexpectedly, the two forgot to close the back window facing the Linping Road intersection. At that time, Lin Zhengtian, a Shanxi man who worked as a mechanic, was passing by. Hearing laughter coming from the window, he became curious and stretched his head to look. He saw two women bathing naked. Therefore, Lin Zhengtian stopped and watched. Soon after, Jiang Liangen and Chen Dagou, Yangzhou men who worked as peddlers, also passed by. Seeing Lin standing outside the window with his eyes unblinking, as if he had seen something, they also stepped forward and peeked alongside him. Unexpectedly, Jiang Liangen accidentally stepped on Lin's toes. Lin scolded him for it, but Jiang retorted. The two sides clashed and fought each other with fists and feet. Jiang Liangen kicked, hitting Lin's scrotum. Lin Zhengtian was injured, in extreme pain, and fell to the ground. Jiang Liangen and others, seeing that they had caused trouble, thought of escaping. Fortunately, a bystander called the police, who arrested Jiang and others and escorted them to the police station for questioning. Lin Zhengtian was taken to the hospital for treatment, his injuries serious and his life in danger.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Large-Scale Red Pill Operation Cracked Upstairs at a Le Ye Barber Shop on Zhaozhou Road: Over Ten Thousand Red Pills and Dozens of Pieces of Machinery Seized: Several Thousand Colored Paper Bags with Gourd Trademark: Prime Suspect Mei Shaosheng Escapes and is Being Strictly Pursued <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the Detective Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau suddenly received a secret report stating that Mei Shaosheng, a Ningbo native residing in the Hexingli, Xinji Bang Road, Hongkou, and Wang Liangsheng from Tongzhou, as well as Lin Liangrui, Zhang Ruiqing, Li Yongxiang, Zhu Jinnan, and others from No. 8, Wangjia Gou, Pudong, had jointly rented the floor above the Yi Le Ye Barber Shop at No. 13, Heng Anfang, Zhaozhou Road, Nanyang Bridge, and had prepared a large number of raw materials for making drugs, secretly setting up a large-scale red pill drug manufacturing operation. To prevent being discovered, Mei Shaosheng personally supervised the workers, starting production only late at night and stopping work at dawn, producing a shocking number of pills every day, which were sold to various places in the surrounding countryside, making a huge profit. Therefore, Mei Shaosheng had the nickname "Red Pill King" in the outside world. After Detective Team Leader Lu Ying learned of this, he immediately reported to Bureau Chief Wen Hongen, who immediately dispatched a large number of long-term police detectives to the address at around 10:00 PM the night before last to secretly investigate. They first surrounded Yi Le Ye on all sides, and then rushed upstairs, where they found the workers busily making red pills in the pavilion room. Upon seeing the detectives arrive, they all panicked and tried to escape, but were captured one by one by the detectives. Five people were arrested, including Wang Liansheng, Lin Liangrui, Li Yongxiang, Zhang Ruiqing, and Zhu Jinnan. On the spot, a large bag of already manufactured red pills was seized, weighing 21 pounds, about 100,000 pills, as well as a piece of red pill dough weighing 10 pounds. There were also dozens of red pill counting boards, car boards, ovens, splints, large and small sieves, cloth bags, small scales, coffee essence, etc. There were also thousands of colored printed paper bags with a gourd trademark printed on the surface, with the words "New Decoration in August of the 21st Year of the Republic of China, Only This One, No Branches." From this, it can be seen that the drug manufacturing operation had been operating for a long time, causing no small amount of harm. The detectives hired a moving truck to transport the prisoners and drugs to the team, interrogated them, and submitted a document to the Third Section of the General Bureau for further investigation. However, the prime suspect Mei Shaosheng, with his keen sense of information, escaped beforehand. The bureau issued a document to the district offices, strictly ordering them to pursue and arrest him for investigation.</p>

<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Shanghai International Settlement sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday stating: "Regarding Madam Yang Shuying's letter, stating that her mother, Yang Wang, was returning home from Guangren Hospital in a rickshaw at 1:00 PM on the 21st of this month when she was hit by tram number 59 on line 3 of the Shanghai Electric Tramway Company. Due to the driver's negligence, her legs were severed. She was taken to Guangren Hospital by the police for treatment. Although there have been no major changes, she is still in critical condition. The company's employment of such a negligent driver should be fully responsible. It has been many days since the accident, but the police have not indicated that they will file a public prosecution, and the company has not shown any concern, disregarding the lives of citizens, which is deeply regrettable. We hereby report this to your council, requesting you to uphold justice and provide assistance. We urge you to instruct the Shanghai Municipal Council to order the company to bear the medical expenses and all other responsibilities, and to punish the driver responsible for the accident to uphold humanity and ensure the safety of citizens." The Association believes that traffic accidents should be prosecuted in order to provide fair compensation to the victims. Providing medical expenses is a humanitarian act and a responsibility that those who manage the city should fulfill. We hereby request your council to handle this matter in accordance with the law and instruct the tram company to be responsible for the medical expenses to protect the lives of the people and serve as a warning for the future.</p>

<p>The Original Dafang Hospital Doctor Continues to See Patients: Dr. Fang Juying has established Dafang Hospital in the French Concession of Shanghai for more than ten years, and has won the approval of society. Later, due to being unable to manage it, he canceled the name of Dafang Hospital two years ago and changed it to a private clinic. Recently, however, there have been those who claim to be able to treat venereal diseases, also calling themselves Dafang Hospital. The outside world is unaware and has been greatly misled. In fact, Dr. Fang Juying has nothing to do with them. Dr. Fang's clinic is now located in Xinmin Village, at the intersection of Rue Massenet and Avenue Lafayette, telephone number 83848. The clinic hours are from 3 to 7 pm. All old friends of the former Dafang Hospital who wish to see a doctor can contact Dr. Fang's clinic in Xinmin Village to avoid being misled.</p>

<p>Reading Problems</p>
<h3 id="e215">Reading Problems of People with Excessively Mobile Lives <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>丨Reply to Wang Qiang, Li Guisheng, Ah Si, and Xiao Heizi丨</p>
<p>Recently, we received four unexpected letters. The writers are a newspaper vendor, a sailor on a ship, and two others: one is a chauffeur in a private house, and the other is a ticket seller on a tram. According to their sincere letters, they are all avid readers of this column. They told me that their common living conditions make them feel dissatisfied with the reading Q&amp;A. Because the reading Q&amp;A clearly overlooks people with their living conditions. They do not have a relatively stable life, cannot have a relatively long reading plan, and not only that, they cannot even have the conditions to continue reading a book of five hundred pages. But they are still young and still demand knowledge. They also said that their environment is really too bad, too mobile, and they don't know what to do. Although they inevitably have doubts and anxiety about their current lives, they have not despaired. They ask us to answer them and ask (Reading Q&amp;A) to pay attention to the reading problems of mobile people. After reading their four letters, we can't help but feel extremely ashamed. Needless to say, we sympathize with them very much.</p>
<p>We decided that (Reading Q&amp;A) should pay attention to discussing the issues raised by these people in the future, and this article will serve as the beginning of the discussion!</p>
<p>Can people with excessively mobile lives not learn well? No! Absolutely not! Our interpretation of the word (reading) should not deviate from each person's environment and engage in abstract speculation on this word. Saying (reading) should have certain conditions, and (reading) will have certain benefits. Such static observer's remarks are only suitable for university lecture halls and the sofas of ladies' reception rooms as materials for (chat) (tea talk). For people lacking sufficient conditions, it is not only useless but also makes (heroes feel discouraged). What we are talking about (reading) is not empty talk about (reading), but (reading) under certain living conditions, it is a concrete (reading), not (reading) separated from personal practice. If so, then under any living conditions, the (reading) problem can be specifically raised, and there is the possibility of (reading). For example, the above four gentlemen are all people with the most unstable lives, but can't they read because they are unstable? This is a misunderstanding caused by static views. Selling newspapers, working as a sailor on a ship, being a private chauffeur, and selling tickets on a tram are not completely without free time. As for living too mobile and too chaotic, and not having a peaceful mind, so it is not suitable for reading, that is also a formal view. Some people cannot read without a quiet place, and are unwilling to read without a long time, which are all mistakes. It must be known that the current social life cannot allow you to have a quiet life or a stable life. If you wait for that kind of condition, it is tantamount to waiting for (bread to fall from the sky), and you will only fail. Taking the sailor on a ship as an example, first, you must immediately develop the habit of not being afraid of noise. Even if the noise is loud, I can still be at ease. When the ship arrives at a certain pier, you can safely read for a day or two. Moreover, there are quite a few knowledgeable people among the passengers on the ship. If you really work hard and are not ashamed to ask questions, who would not be happy to teach you? How can you not have reading conditions! Let's talk about private chauffeurs! In addition to sending the owner to the office or dance hall, your car is always resting for several hours. Aren't you very free? When your car is parked in the street, don't listen to the jazz music of the dance hall, you can take out the book you want to read from under the seat cushion and read it quietly. Naturally, the other two types of employees still have the possibility of reading in their lives. As for not being able to make a long-term plan, why not shorten it? A year is too long, can you make it three months? If you can't finish reading a large book of four or five hundred pages, why not use a small book of one or two hundred pages? You should do everything according to the practice and possibilities of your life. Don't use the environment to accommodate the book, but use reading to accommodate the environment. A friend of mine told me that in order to read, he plans to resign from his job, which is completely wrong, and does not understand the logic of life. We should not have a negative attitude towards current difficulties, not only in terms of reading. We should try our best to use the conditions that are obviously not available for reading. If Grandpa has only half an hour a day, I will use half an hour. If there is not even half an hour, I will save two or three ten minutes from my sleeping and eating time. We should create the conditions for reading. We should turn the conditions that are unfavorable to us into conditions that are beneficial to us, and transform the current bad environment into a new and better stage. Our life logic is continuous creation, not staying at a certain stage, looking at it and there is no way, stopping and sighing. Napoleon said that there is no difficult word in his dictionary. He is a person who has read the logic of life. The only thing in the world that can be called happy is the success gained after overcoming difficulties, not the person who enjoys the achievements of his ancestors. He never stops in front of obstacles, he dares to face difficulties and is not afraid of failure. People who succeed in reading are almost not people who have all the comfortable conditions, but people who have reached step by step through many dangers and difficulties.</p>
<p>Therefore, we thought that many readers have given up on the reading reports we have made. They often use the current difficulties as an excuse for not moving forward, which is very regrettable. They often exaggerate the difficulties, formally talk about reading, and separate reading from their own lives. These are all harmful concepts for reading and must be removed quickly!</p>
<p>Our reading guidance department does not offer abstract (reading). That is, the various articles on reading methods published in this column have always been intended as reference for everyone, not to be mechanically applied by readers. For example, I have repeatedly provided readers with reading lists for various subjects. We do not want everyone to do that. Readers should dissolve our guidance according to their own living environment and take in the parts they need. We also have different answers for each person who comes to ask for reading guidance, because each person's living conditions are different, and a formula should not be mechanically prescribed.</p>
<p>We cannot wait for good conditions to fall from the sky, and we should not retreat in the face of difficulties. We hope that the four gentlemen will quickly decide on a reading plan with the lowest and shortest time, and then have further discussions with us.</p>
<p>Finally, we dare to say to everyone that knowledge should be obtained bit by bit anytime and anywhere. As long as you don't reject knowledge, not only in books, but all aspects of society are the raw materials you can absorb.</p>

<p>Track and Field Meet to be Held on the 3rd and 4th</p>
<p>The joint sports meet organized by Southeast Medical College, Business School, Political Science College, Sino-French Institute of Technology, Tongde Medical College, and Zhengfeng Liberal Arts College (Zhizhi College has withdrawn) will hold the track and field meet on June 3rd and 4th at Jiaotong University. The volleyball competition has already begun. All six schools have joined the men's group, but only Southeast Medical and Business School have formed women's teams. A best-of-three format will be used. In the first match, Southeast defeated Business School. The Business School and Southeast Medical College men's teams will compete for the finals. The results of each match are as follows:</p>
<p>Political Science defeats Zhengfeng: Held at the Fudan High School playground. The two teams were closely matched in strength. Political Science had better coordination. The first set was won after a close score. The situation remained the same in the second set, with Political Science winning 21-15. Zhengfeng lost two sets in a row and lost their fighting spirit. The third set was even more lackluster.</p>

<p>Southeast defeats Sino-French: The two teams faced off at the Shanghai Business School field. Southeast's technique had already improved, with both spikes and other skills showing promise.

<p>Southeast defeats Business School: Women's teams from Southeast and Business School played at the Business School field. It was agreed in advance to adopt a best-of-three-out-of-five format. The two sides were evenly matched in strength. Southeast was known for its consistency. Although the Business School possessed strong players such as Shen Yongming, Shi Jiyun, Ye Zhiming, and He Zhaozhen from the former Wuben Song High School, they ultimately lost due to poor coordination and frequent errors, resulting in a crushing defeat of one to three.</p>

<h3 id="e232">Hao Gengsheng Discusses the Far Eastern Games <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>Hao Gengsheng, Physical Education Supervisor of the Ministry of Education, who attended the Far Eastern Games, returned to Nanjing on the 29th. According to him, the issue of winning or losing in the Far Eastern Games was a minor matter. The Japanese conspiracy (to have the puppet state join) and our country's efforts to respond were the major issues. Therefore, our country's representatives had a heavy responsibility. Our country's representatives and athletes were warmly welcomed by overseas Chinese in Hong Kong and the Philippines. In terms of competition results, apart from football and women's swimming, most were not as good. However, observing the efforts of each individual this time showed great progress compared to the past. For example, in baseball, our country usually pays little attention, and it was expected that we would be unable to compete. However, the result was only a narrow defeat of 4 to 1 and 4 to 0. In volleyball, we even managed to defeat the Philippines once. As for basketball, tennis, track and field, etc., although there were many failures, the score difference was not too great. From this, it can be seen that there has been significant progress in our country's physical education in recent years. Regarding the revision of the constitution, our representative argued rationally and firmly. The Japanese were unable to use their tricks. The Philippines, enticed by them, proposed that a special small committee be formed in addition to the general assembly, with representatives from China, Japan, and the Philippines as members. The general assembly would then transfer the revision of the constitution to this committee for discussion. Our side spoke eloquently, and the Japanese were unable to propose the puppet state in this committee. Our representative disagreed with the revision of the constitution and returned the case to the general assembly. The Japanese president wanted to open the general assembly early because he feared that this issue would affect this year's Games, so it was delayed until the 19th. During the general assembly, because the third article was not working, they tried to make tricks in the tenth article (group participation in the performance) and the fourteenth article of the supplementary rules, interpreting the so-called two-thirds. China took five units as the formal explanation. The Philippines was biased and wanted to vote for Japan. China considered it illegal and withdrew. The Japanese were unable to go any further and resorted to illegally dissolving the general assembly by enticing the Philippines. After the dissolution, the United States and the Philippines were in uproar, ignoring public opinion. The Philippines also felt uneasy. When our representatives and athletes returned home, the President of the Philippine Senate, Quezon (President of the Far Eastern Games from 1934 to 1935), had a conversation with our Dr. Wang Zhengting, saying that he would try his best to remedy the Far Eastern Games. Our country will consider how to proceed based on his approach. As for explaining the situation to the World Games, when China sent the athlete Liu Changchun to the World Games last time, the association did not recognize the puppet state, which was already a certainty. The illegal dissolution of the Far Eastern Games this time is enough to expose its shortcomings. Hao's thoughts on attending this time: (1) He felt that although the competition results were not as good as others in many respects, the people of all countries were able to do their best, which was much better than before. (2) Others have made more progress, and we have made less progress, so we can stimulate our determination to work hard for more progress in the future. (3) The Japanese are unreasonable, but their fighting spirit is commendable. For example, in football, which has always been very poor, although they lost this time, there were two matches where the score was 3 to 3 and 4 to 4 with us. Also, although volleyball is not good, they were able to defeat the Philippines once. From this, it can be seen that they have been working hard on weekdays, which our country can refer to. (4) There are many things to be done in domestic sports. We should be down-to-earth, strive for self-improvement, and work hard to fight so that we can show our true spirit in a suitable environment in the future. As for the Far Eastern Games, it is a place to show sports, but as long as we train, we can show something. The Far Eastern Games are another issue, and we should not stop eating because we are choked.</p>

<p>In order to improve their skills and learn from experience, the Xiguang Cross-Country Team took advantage of the return of our country's Far Eastern Games athletes to Shanghai to invite the British resident Haha team to compete. The event is scheduled for this Sunday. The total distance is four and a half miles, or 7,200 meters. There will be a trophy (a silver cup donated by the Liyia Company) to increase interest. Each side will send ten participants, with the top six from each team scoring points. The team with the fewest points wins. It is reported that the Haha team is very strong. The Xiguang players, riding the momentum of their victory over Datong University, are determined to compete with the "yellow-haired blue-eyed" team. According to Xiguang, the team's sports meet has already ended, and although they did not achieve outstanding records, the results of each event were still satisfactory. As for the starting location of this competition, it is currently under negotiation but will most likely be at (1) Hongkou Park, (2) Nanshi, or (3) the newly built Pudong Avenue in Pudong. Xiguang has scheduled a temporary staff meeting for 2:00 PM today to discuss the strategy and requirements for the competition.</p>

<h3 id="e236">Ministry of Education Sports Committee Holds Meeting to Discuss Physical Education Testing Methods <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education's Sports Committee convened a meeting at the Ministry of Education at 5:00 PM on the 28th to discuss physical education testing matters with physical education teachers from public and private middle schools in the capital. Nineteen middle school physical education teachers attended. Chairman Zhang Jiong reported on the purpose of the meeting. Committee member Wu Yunrui reported on the testing methods that had been developed, saying that the former professor of Zhongda, McClay, had selected items that could be practiced universally and could represent physical education results at a glance, based on the physical education situation in Japan and the United States. There were no objections to the testing methods. All schools in Beijing were required to test according to these methods by the end of June, and the methods would be gradually promoted to Jiangsu, Shanghai, and other provinces and cities in the future. The testing methods are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e237">Testing Methods <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>(1) How to Fill Out the Form</p>
<p>A. Age: It is best to fill in the actual age. If not, the old method of calculating age can be used, but it must be marked with the word "yin" after it.</p>
<p>B. It is best to have the Gregorian calendar birthday. Otherwise, the lunar calendar can be recorded, but it must be marked with the word "yin" after it.</p>
<p>C. Height is in inches.</p>
<p>D. Weight is in pounds.</p>
<p>(2) Management of Testing</p>
<p>A. 50-meter run: 50 meters for junior high school and below, and 50 meters for senior high school and above. When running, there must be one timer and one starter. When running 100 meters, two or three referees must be added. A stopwatch is sufficient for the 50-meter run because the distance is not long. If there is only one stopwatch for the 100-meter run, three or four people can run at the same time. The method is to first mark three or four lanes on the 100-meter track. At each lane, near the finish line, mark a horizontal line or make a mark every meter from the finish line to 75 meters. When running, the starter blows the whistle and simultaneously makes a downward waving motion with a towel. The timer presses the watch when they see the towel move. When they reach 11 seconds, they shout "Arrived!" or blow the whistle. A referee is assigned to each lane, standing on the side of the track inside the finish line, to be in charge of the distance reached by the runner in their lane. When they hear the timer blow the whistle or shout "Arrived!", they should pay attention to the distance reached by the runner, and then check the time from the following table.</p>
<p>12.1 seconds 100 meters	12.1 seconds 99.05 meters	15.1 seconds 76.39 meters</p>

<p>15.0 seconds 77.00 meters	18.0 seconds 61.67 meters</p>
<p>(2) Standing Long Jump (Senior High School Adds Running Long Jump)</p>
<p>Draw many lines on a mat or the ground, spaced one decimeter apart, from 1.5 meters to 2.5 meters. It is not necessary to measure the starting point when jumping. Each person takes three jumps in succession, and the longest distance is recorded.</p>
<p>(3) Running High Jump</p>
<p>This item is slow. If there are many people but only one high jump stand, each height is only allowed to be jumped once. If a height cannot be cleared, it can be raised again, but at most three attempts are allowed. However, the score is calculated based on the height that was cleared. When raising the height, senior high school students add 5 millimeters each time below 1 meter, and 3 millimeters above that. For junior high school students, add 5 millimeters each time below 8 centimeters, and 3 millimeters above that.</p>
<p>(4) Shot Put</p>
<p>8 pounds for junior high school, 12 pounds for senior high school, 6 pounds for women's junior high school, and 8 pounds for senior high school. If there is a shot put circle, use it. Otherwise, draw a lime circle with a diameter of 2.134 meters and use its center to draw several arcs of the same circle, spaced a quarter of a meter apart, from 4 meters to 12 meters. Each person takes three throws in succession, and the longest distance is recorded. To speed up the process of throwing, another circle can be set up opposite one circle, with the arcs overlapping each other.</p>
<p>(Note) All the above results should be transcribed onto the form. Please ask the Ministry of Education to purchase a scale for each school to use in rotation.</p>

In order to facilitate the progress of the competition, the association will expedite the completion of all pre-selections by the 7th. It is reported that the team uniforms have been solicited by Chen Zhensheng, a member of the association's executive committee, from the Hongzhang Table Tennis Association. The player Ma Tingliang is also willing to solicit nine pairs of sneakers to be distributed to the selected team members as encouragement. According to recent results, Lu Hanjun, Chen Zhensheng, Ma Tingliang, Zhou Shanyang, and Lu Xiulu are the most promising candidates. It is now known that all competitions have been held at the Jiande Venue from 7:30 PM every night.</p>

<h3 id="e252">Records of the Incense-Enshrouded Boudoir <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Originally Written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Statement Regarding This Book</p>
<p>After its major revamp in early April, Spring and Autumn added the novel "Records of the Incense-Enshrouded Boudoir," translated by me. At that time, we had already stated in advance that our intention in publishing this novel was not to verify events of the previous dynasty, but simply to provide some variety for readers' interest. Later, in a preface written for this publication by Princess Rong Ling, the sister of the author Der Ling, and in my "Introduction to the Original Author," it was repeatedly stated that the content of this book is not entirely historical fact. Readers should only appreciate its exquisite embellishments and vivid writing, and not regard it as an accurate account of events in the Qing court. Because we know that novels are absolutely different from history, romances, and biographies; they contain many castles in the air fabricated by the author to connect the events in the book and please readers. Of course, this is not unique to "Records of the Incense-Enshrouded Boudoir"!</p>
<p>Recently, some people have made quite detailed corrections to the content of this book; from the standpoint of verifying events of the previous dynasty, this attitude is correct. However, since this is a novel, a different perspective should be adopted.</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn published this novel for three reasons:</p>
<p>(1) Der Ling previously wrote a book titled "Two Years in the Forbidden City," which was translated into Chinese and well-received by readers. She can be considered a pioneering female writer in China. In a China where female writers are still rare, we feel that we should introduce her works as much as possible.</p>
<p>(2) Although there are many exaggerated descriptions in the text, it is still quite interesting, and it portrays the personality of Empress Dowager Cixi very thoroughly, so it is still a good novel.</p>
<p>(3) Although the book is divided into thirty-five sections, each section can be separated, equivalent to twenty-five short stories; this structure is more suitable for our daily newspaper.</p>
<p>In order to increase readers' interest, after the entire book has been published, we will invite Princess Rong Ling and Mr. Xun Ling to write a detailed article verifying events of the Qing court, as if doing an accounting. If readers have any doubts now, they may wish to write them down one by one, and then compare them item by item with this verification, which would be even more interesting, wouldn't it?</p>
<h3 id="e253">Improved Silkworm Seed <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Yusheng</p>
<p>It is said that due to the complete bankruptcy of the rural economy, many silkworm farmers are unable to purchase improved silkworm seeds at the very beginning of the silkworm season. Although they are well aware that the result of using "native seeds" year after year is a waste of effort, because native seeds do not require money to buy, even the small cost of silkworm seeds must be carefully calculated in these times of extreme economic hardship. They are truly pitifully poor! It is said that the silkworms that emerge from native seeds are mostly gluttonous and lazy. During the three molting periods, the amount of mulberry leaves "consumed" is substantial. Some turn black and decompose into a pile of foul-smelling liquid just after the third molt. This is certainly partly due to the influence of the weather, but the inherent unsoundness of the silkworm seeds and their lack of resistance are undeniable. Some show good signs during the third molt, but seem unwilling to "spin a cocoon" when they reach the spinning stage, holding their heads up and appearing unhappy. Silkworm farmers are truly both angry and anxious when they encounter these gluttonous and lazy creatures, and mostly throw them on the ground, where a flock of hens devours them piecemeal!</p>
<p>Improved seeds are not like that. They have undergone a series of forging procedures. Gluttonous and lazy silkworm seeds cannot withstand this forging, so they are all eliminated, and therefore cannot come out to harm people! Since improved seeds can withstand a series of forging procedures, the silkworm seeds themselves are naturally sounder. They have the ability to resist the "deterioration" and "decay" brought about by the weather, and can withstand "storms," so their contribution to humanity is particularly great. Although they may sometimes suffer from irresistible disasters, causing worry to silkworm farmers, the signs of premature death and gluttonous laziness that are typical of "native seeds" are rarely seen. Therefore, the market price of silk cocoons made from improved seeds is much higher than that of "native seeds." The latter, even if they escape the greedy mouths of chickens, are mostly thrown into the "ash pond" and turned into fertilizer. This is one way to make use of waste!</p>
<h3 id="e254">The Future of Stone Lake <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Yanqiao</p>
<p>My home, Stone Lake, in Suzhou, can be considered a good place. Its charm lies in its proximity to the city. Even the frailest, slowest-moving painted boat can reach the Xingchun Bridge in less than an hour. Especially along the Hengtang, there are green mountains and clear waters, more naturally beautiful than the Qili Shantang.</p>
<p>The Xingchun Bridge connects to the Nine-Ring Cave Bridge, like a curtain to Stone Lake. Lifting the curtain, the mirror-like lake, the gentle breeze, the entire Stone Lake is presented before you. In the middle is a small islet called the site of the Lakeside Pavilion, surrounded by reeds, reminiscent of Ruan Gong Pier in West Lake. To the left is the Yulang Village managed by the painter Wu Zishen, with its black walls and white corridors, and to the right are the remnants of the Haichao Temple, with its yellow walls and green grass, the colors harmonizing in a simple and pleasing way. Climbing to the Hushantang of Zhiping Temple, drinking a cup of tea, walking into the dense Shaolin, listening to the spring, admiring the solitary pagoda of Shangfang Mountain, and enjoying the scenery for a moment, I feel that this environment, where one can easily enjoy the pleasures of ascent and the delights of the heart and ears, is a pity to be shrouded in an atmosphere of superstition. If a road were built, ______, ______, and small houses were built, some red peach trees and green willows were planted, and a few small boats were allowed to float on the lake, wouldn't it be a wonderful Stone Lake Park? It seems that when Wang Yincai was the mayor of Suzhou, he had mentioned this idea, but the people of Suzhou are not enthusiastic about anything, especially beautifying the lake and mountains, considering it not urgent. In fact, the people of Suzhou have never worked hard on urgent matters either.</p>
<p>Mr. Li Yinquan often visited the mountains, forests, temples, and monasteries in this area, so he left many inscriptions. There are many stones in Zhiping Temple, all inscribed with words, which can be said to be the work of enthusiasts. According to the guide, many people come from all directions to offer incense after the Mid-Autumn Festival in August, and the people at the foot of the mountain rely on this to get a little benefit. Unfortunately, the monks on this mountain do not have the skillful methods of the Hangzhou monks, otherwise, how difficult would it be to start large-scale construction and decorate the mountains and forests in a new and attractive way?</p>

<p>When survival cannot be answered, life will feel exhausted.</p>
<p>People grow up in a vast world, but live in a very small world. Money from all directions flows to the city. The city's diseases flow to all directions.</p>
<p>Because they have not been hit, they dare to take great risks; once they encounter some setbacks, even a small amount of courage disappears!</p>

<p>Chapter Twenty-Nine</p>
<p>Returning the Letter, Heartbroken and Self-Isolating</p>
<p>Swearing Brotherhood, Together Vowing Loyalty</p>
<p>Bao Fang nodded without adding any criticism. Just as they were talking, a rumbling sound suddenly approached. Looking up, they saw two enemy planes circling overhead. Whether their intention was to target the Ping'an village fortress was difficult to say. However, since the enemy planes were overhead, people should avoid being targeted, so Bao Fang gestured to Ziqiang, and everyone took shelter inside the house. After a long while, there was no movement, and the rumbling sound had faded away. When Ziqiang came out, he saw that Yin Deren was already outside. He smiled faintly, shrugging his shoulders. Although he did not speak, he seemed to be saying, "What's the big deal?" At the same time, he saw that he was holding many red and green leaflets and was looking around, as if he intended to find a few more. Ziqiang asked, "Did they drop these from the plane? What do they say on them? Let me see." Yin Deren laughed and said, "Is there any need to look? Even a cook could guess what they say. Looking at this will only cause panic. Let's not lead the brothers down this road." As he spoke, he rolled the leaflets into a bundle, pressed them on the ground, struck a match, and lit the leaflets. Before long, they had turned into a puff of blue smoke. Ziqiang laughed and said, "Second Brother, you are so clever and capable. I am not as good as you in everything." Yin Deren laughed and said, "I understand why you admire me. It's because you feel that I, as a bachelor, am too comfortable after you got married." Ziqiang sighed and said, "Comfortable or not, that's how it is for soldiers. But the mental pain I suffer is simply indescribable. This is something that you bachelors don't experience." Yin Deren said, "Hey! You're still thinking about your family. How can you lead your company of brothers like this?" (397)</p>

<h3 id="e257">Cat Talk <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Yun</p>
<p>Besides "horse, cow, sheep, chicken, dog, pig," the cat is indeed an important animal among domestic animals: In Jiangnan families, almost every household keeps a cat. Cats not only catch mice, preventing those jumping clowns from stealing food and destroying things under the cover of darkness, disturbing residents, but also their gentle nature and pleasing fur are quite endearing. In the past, seven or eight out of ten young ladies in their boudoirs loved cats. I remember seeing a calendar with a painting of a beautiful woman by Zhang Mantuo, with a corner of the boudoir showing a fashionable woman teasing a kitten with a velvet rope in front of a roaring fireplace: the quiet scene could not help but evoke a feeling of lingering infatuation! Now, the times are gradually changing, and the temperament of young ladies is also changing with the wheels of time, from quiet to more active. In the arms or at the feet of modern ladies is a fluffy, foreign-bred puppy. However, the cat is still a lovely animal, with smooth fur that is so soft and adorable. The cat's character is somewhat like a tiger: its head must be round, its chin must be broad, its whole body must have powerful fur, and especially its tail, which can often stand upright, is a sign of a good mouse-catching cat. If the chin is narrow and the cat's mouth is pointed, it is sure to be a lazy cat. If the tail is often tucked between the buttocks, it is either sick or a cold and weak cat. Autumn cats are not good cats.</p>
<p>Among cats, those born in the spring are the best: at that time, silkworm cocoons are just hatching, so they are called "early silkworm cats." Because those cats mate in winter and go through wind and snow, they are physically strong, cold-resistant, and able to endure hardship. As for those cats born in summer or autumn, they spend their days in the stove during winter, requiring a blazing fire to be added to the stove door to emulate Cao Aman breaking through the encirclement at Chibi, sleeping all day in the rice straw ashes, unwilling to stick their heads out.</p>
<p>The appearance of cats can be roughly divided into two types: one is the lion cat, which is very cute because its fine fur is fluffy and resembles a lion. However, since the hair is fluffy and disheveled, it is naturally easy to accumulate dirt and grime. People who keep them must be diligent, loving, and attentive to grooming in order to keep them beautiful and clean. The other type is the ordinary cat. These cats can be further divided into several names based on the color of their fur. A cat with a completely black back and snow-white belly is called "black cloud covering snow"; a cat with a completely white body and a black tail is called "dragging a gun in the snow." There is also "iron rod hitting cherries," which refers to a cat with a yellow or black round spot on its forehead. The most common are tortoiseshell and tabby cats.</p>
<p>Female cats are more valuable than male cats, because female cats are only unwilling to settle down for a few days a year during their heat season. They usually maintain chastity and stay quietly at home, unlike male cats, which are sexually active all year round, pursuing mates, urinating along the way, and causing trouble, even neglecting their proper work of catching mice! Therefore, as the saying goes, "Female dogs and male cats, don't give them away to others." It is indeed something that is not welcomed by people, and cats and dogs are a clear example!</p>
<p>Cats' eyes can see in the dark, so they can catch mice in the dark. Those two eyes look like two green stars in the darkness. Some cats have eyes that look red and green in the dark, like gold and silver stars, which is called "gold and silver eyes" and are very capable of catching mice. Cats' pupils are the most peculiar, changing with the time of day; at midnight and noon, they look like a silver thread, then gradually become round, changing from a line to a shuttle, and from a shuttle to a perfect circle, as if it were a natural clock. Among treasures, there is a type called "cat's eye," which is said to be able to indicate time and is a priceless treasure.</p>
<p>Cats are carnivorous animals that catch mice, so fish is the main ingredient in their food. The time for cats to eat is generally around noon, because they need to catch mice at night. If they are fed too much, they will not be willing to catch mice. Therefore, there is a saying, "Feed the cat in the morning, feed the dog at night." Cats can live for about five or six to seven or eight years. One week after kittens are born, they can be fed sugar rice, and after half a month, they can eat ordinary rice. When kittens first start eating, adding some fried dough sticks (also known as fried rice cakes, a type of fried pasta) can prevent kittens from getting sick; in this era when veterinary medicine has not yet been fully developed, the only medicine for cats when they are sick is to buy some Wuyao, grind the juice, and feed it to them, which is considered the only way to treat cat illnesses.</p>

<p>Major Players Actively Covering Short Positions</p>
<p>A Day of Encouraging Market Trends</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market sentiment was notably positive. Major players were exceptionally active in placing orders, leading to active short covering and a subsequent rebound in prices. The morning began with a stable overseas silver market in London. However, the American silver market and forward silver prices were closed. Exchange rates between the UK and US, as well as the UK and France, saw reduced activity. Commodity prices were also reported. Foreign dispatches indicated potential new gold-silver parity rates under consideration in the US House of Representatives, along with a possible passage of a 25% silver reserve requirement. Despite these developments, the market opened at 19.20 yuan, showing no significant impact. The situation stabilized after the opening, hovering around the 20 yuan mark for quite some time. Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC)'s official rates were announced, showing no changes for the UK and US. While market sentiment was good, immediate price increases were difficult. Later, the British American Tobacco Company (BAT) settled in shillings, gradually pushing prices upward. The arrival of Sassoon to cover near-term US dollar positions further strengthened market sentiment, leading to higher gold prices. Banks were still willing to release holdings. The midday situation remained relatively calm. However, in the afternoon, banks continued to supply exchange notes, causing the gold market to show signs of strain. Nevertheless, the 20 yuan level was not breached, and market sentiment remained positive, shifting from fatigue to stability. Other firms also covered US dollar positions, leading to widespread buying interest in the market. Major players, such as Fuchang Heng, Yu Zhaofeng, Changqian, and Changxiang, actively purchased without hesitation. Short covering, by companies like Senchangyong, occurred repeatedly. The upward trend was reignited. Throughout the day, price fluctuations remained narrow, with no special changes. The price of fine gold was 1032.3 yuan. Spot goods flowed in from all directions, and the swap market reversed, with short positions now offering advances. The day's market conditions are recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was at 1020.3 yuan, a rebound of 2.3 yuan from the previous close. Commodities opened at 20 yuan. In the foreign exchange market, the morning opening price for near-term UK exchange notes was 1 shilling, 3 and a half pence. The US exchange rate was 30.8125 yuan. Tongfeng Heng entered the market immediately, rising from 20 yuan to 20.04 yuan. Dadecheng, Yifeng, Yongyuqing, Yongdeng, etc., sold positions. HSBC's official rates for the UK and US were unchanged, dropping to 19.2 yuan. Tianfeng, Shengda, and Hengxing purchased orders, rising to 20.05 yuan. Chunyuan Yong actively sold orders, then retreated to 19.3 yuan. Dadecheng purchased orders. The situation remained stable. Small investors all raised prices, breaking through 20 yuan. Subsequently, the domestic market tightened. Someone sought to cover September US dollar positions at 1.875. Hengyu, Fuxing, Yongfuyu, Senchangyong, Zhaofeng, Changshun, Maofuan, and Hengxing, among others, actively bought, rising to 20.235 yuan. Qianchangxiang, etc., supplied at high prices, retreating to 20.2 yuan. However, Hengyu and Fuchang continued to actively purchase, rising again to 20.33 yuan. Fuyu's commodities came to sell. British firms settled June US dollar positions at 0.75, then dropping to 20.18 yuan. Market sentiment remained stable, and the gold market remained firm.

<p>The afternoon opening was at 1021.8 yuan. Commodities opened at 20.2 yuan. Senchangyong and Yuanmaoyong delivered orders, rising to 20.25 yuan. Banks were inclined to sell. HSBC settled August US dollar positions at 33 yuan, and Citibank and HSBC settled June US dollar positions at 0.75.

Qingyu sold, retreating to 20.09 yuan. British companies and Sumitomo covered July US dollar positions at 0.875. Yifengyong, Senchangyong, Hengyu, Qianchangxiang, Fuchang, Zhaofengchang, etc., bought aggressively, rising to 20.35 yuan. Hanh Heng, Yifengyong, Yongshengda came to supply orders, leading to a pullback. However, because Fuxingyong and Hengyu continued to buy, the market situation remained stable, merely fluctuating. The closing price was 1022.8 yuan. Commodities were quoted at 20.2 yuan. Therefore, the market slightly weakened after closing. However, Tongtaichang and Fuxingyong still showed buying interest, struggling at 20.23 yuan. The highest price during the day was 1023.5 yuan, and the lowest price was 1019.2 yuan, with a fluctuation of 4.3 yuan. As a result, the closing price rose by 4.6 yuan compared to the previous day's close.</p>
<p>The settlement price, based on HSBC's US exchange rate, remained unchanged at 32.5 yuan, resulting in a standard gold price of 1064.62 yuan.

The spot market for refined gold was sluggish, lacking buyers, with very few transactions. Generally, the price was about 12 to 12.5 yuan higher. The supply of spot goods was continuous, arriving from all directions. The central bank showed no current interest in buying, leading to unfavorable conditions for swap long positions. Initially, Qianchangxiang offered 210 orders to Yingfengheng, settling them. Later, due to public order issues, long positions offered advances instead, with Yingfengheng offering 210 orders at 4 jiao to Dadecheng. Subsequently, it was heard that short positions were offering advances at 8 jiao. Public orders were about to be closed out, with an abundance of spot goods and rich reserves. Over 3,000 orders were closed out as soon as the market opened. As of today, there were 3,703 June orders remaining, totaling 10 long positions and 7 short positions.</p>

<p>May 30th, the gold market remained stable. The market situation was peaceful for half a day. In the morning, overseas silver markets in the UK and US both rose, and forward silver prices also increased by 0.6 to 1.5 li. Exchange rates, however, tightened. London raw gold rose by half a penny, American cotton rose by two pounds, and American wheat saw both rises and falls. It appeared that there should be a slight decrease. However, sentiment in Shanghai remained firm. Furthermore, news agencies such as the Associated Press reported that the silver bill proposed by the president would be put to a vote in the House of Representatives tomorrow, with expectations that it would pass, and that the 50% tax on silver profits would be retained. Before the market opened, goods were first traded at 19.20 yuan, and then the gold industry opened at around 20 yuan. The opening price was 1019.8 yuan, down 0.8 yuan from the previous close, with commodities opening at the same price. After the opening, because the foreign exchange market seemed loose, and it was anticipated that HSBC's official rates for the UK and US would each increase by 0.125, Dingkang, Dakang, Hengyu, Yongde, Futaiheng, and others sold orders, and the price hovered and fell from 20.1 yuan. However, because Dafayong, Fuxing Yong, Yingfengheng, and Tongyi all had buying interest, there was still a struggle at around 18 yuan. When Dadecheng, Daxingyong, and Hengchangyong sold orders, the price fell to 16.6 yuan. Yuanchangyong and Hengtai entered orders and stabilized, and Yuqingyong and Yifengyong even entered at 19 yuan.

<p>Foreign Exchange</p>

The morning opening price for near-term UK exchange notes was 1 shilling, 3 pence, and 4375 points. The US exchange rate was 30.8125 yuan, with little change from the previous close. After the opening, due to news that the Roosevelt administration was considering a 50% tax on silver profits, the market loosened. HSBC's official rates were announced, with both the UK and US rates unchanged. Banks were already selling June US dollar positions at 32.875 yuan and shilling positions at 0.5625. Sassoon actively sold. Although this price was once covered, banks then sold September US dollar positions at 33.3125, and the process remained firm. Later, silver prices in the evening market did not show special changes, and fluctuations began. Eventually, the gold market stabilized, and banks repeatedly covered, tightening again slightly. By the midday close, the near-term selling price for UK exchange notes was 1 shilling, 3 and a half pence, and the British exchange rate was 32.875 yuan, each loosening by 0.0625 from the previous close. Chinese merchants both covered and sold, and after netting, there was a slight selling. Banks such as Hua Bi McGalligary were on the buying side, while Datong Sassoon and Japanese banks sold.</p>

The trading of call loans was 5.2 million+ in the morning market for transfer accounts and new transactions, and 200,000+ in the afternoon market. Transactions in the Small General Association were 500,000+.

<p>Yesterday, the market at the Chinese Securities Exchange was relatively stable, not as volatile as the previous day's rise. However, the trend was still from weak to strong, with a large rise followed by a small correction. Regarding the environmental news, it was rumored that after Ji Ming arrived in Shanghai, the diplomatic situation in North China would be resolved, and Huang Fu would go north soon. The obstacles ahead might be reduced, and sentiment gradually improved. The demand from major players gradually increased. The seven-month futures contracts were listed for the first day the day before yesterday, and all contracts were opened, resulting in active trading. Some major players went from short to long, and there should still be a rising trend in the future. The opening price of gold short was higher than the opening price the day before yesterday, with the highest price being 69.35 yuan. The situation was very good. The opening price yesterday continued to rise at first, but then many small long position holders closed their positions, so the subsequent column was slightly weaker. The rise and fall was not consistent, with fluctuations of 3-4 jiao. In the second column, the market price for the fourth series of sales continued to decrease by a small 2-3 jiao. In the afternoon, major players such as the fifth, sixteenth, and seventeenth series all had buying interest, and the market price uniformly returned to high by 1-3 jiao. The closing price continued to rise, increasing by another 2-3 jiao. The closing price of gold short was 69.35 yuan. As a result, the market prices were mixed, with most falling and few rising. The amount was only 0.05-0.1 yuan. The highest number was only about 0.2 yuan. The total number of transactions was 11,170,000 yuan. The results of the rise and fall are listed below.

As a result, market sentiment is agitated, and short sellers are covering their positions in large quantities. Buying interest has surged, and the price increase is intensifying. A new peak price of 182.5 yuan has been discovered. Part of the manufacturers are selling in the middle of trading, and the market price has flattened slightly. The future of the market depends on actual sales. The previous day (30th), the number of May yarn delivery was 8,750 bales, and the delivery price was 174 yuan, and all were settled.</p>
<p>(The Golden Rooster Head Plate Jumps Three Yuan) The Standard Yarn pre-market opening has developed with real yarn sales, and market sentiment is suddenly tight. Buying interest is extremely high, and short sellers are covering their positions. The prices of contracts for various months are up by two yuan, three, four, and seven jiao, to one yuan and nine jiao. In the afternoon, some profit-takers closed their positions, and the prices of contracts for various months were down by four or five jiao. The full-day transaction volume was 87,700 bales. It was found that Huikang sold 1,150 bales, Yiyu sold 1,200 bales, Daji sold 2,050 bales, Changyu sold 1,750 bales, Hengde sold 2,400 bales, Renfeng sold 2,900 bales, Yuantai sold 2,100 bales, and Dachang sold 1,950 bales. Huikang purchased 5,350 bales, Gengfeng purchased 3,300 bales, Dafu purchased 1,200 bales, Shenji purchased 2,450 bales, Dachangcheng purchased 1,400 bales, Xiesheng purchased 1,350 bales, Xincheng purchased 1,550 bales, and Renfeng purchased 1,150 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Contract | Highest Price | Lowest Price | Closing Price | Change from Previous Day | Existing Inventory</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>June | 179.1 | 178.0 | 178.0 | Up 1.90 | 42,900</p>

<p>Total |  |  |  |  | 197,050</p>
<p>(Current Yarn Sales are Very Strong) Current yarn sales are particularly strong. It has been found that buyers from various groups have purchased a total of 3,400 bales in the past two days. Prices are up by 2-3 yuan compared to the price on the 29th. The purchase amounts for each group are listed below.</p>
<p>Tianjin 150, Guangdong 190, Wuhu 110, Yunnan 210, Changsha 50, Shantou 225, Inland 565, Northern Group 50, Fujian 25, Xiamen 10</p>
<p>May Cotton Delivery Volume: 48,300 Dan, Price: 45 Yuan</p>
<p>The cotton market rose sharply in the morning, following the yarn market. Later, profit-takers and Japanese merchants closed their positions in large quantities, causing the table to flatten slightly. Therefore, the cotton market is not as strong as the yarn market. However, bullish companies are still very bullish, but slightly selling when the price rises. Overseas cotton industry conditions are flat, and current cotton demand is slightly stagnant due to high prices. Most people have a consistent psychology of watching for higher prices. The previous day (30th), the number of May cotton delivery was 48,300 dan, and the delivery price was 45 yuan.</p>
<p>(Zheng Biao Follows the Rise by Half a Yuan) The Standard Cotton pre-market opening began, and the cotton market rose sharply with the surge in yarn market prices. As for the second and third plate, the bullish side released some of their holdings. As a result, the contracts for each month are up by two jiao and a half to three, four, and five jiao. In the afternoon, prices fell back by five cents to a dime. The full-day transaction volume was 193,700 dan. It was found that Changhe sold 13,800 dan, Changfeng sold 9,500 dan, Xiesheng sold 3,000 dan, Renfeng sold 5,100 dan, Shenji sold 3,100 dan, Minghua sold 4,600 dan, Tongji sold 2,100 dan, Chunji sold 4,500 dan, Dafeng sold 4,000 dan, and Huikang sold 4,600 dan. Yuanxingchang purchased 8,600 dan, Huikang purchased 12,500 dan, Gengfeng purchased 4,800 dan, Yicheng purchased 2,400 dan, Suilong purchased 2,000 dan, Dafeng purchased 3,000 dan, Yukang purchased 3,600 dan, Dafu purchased 2,100 dan, Jifeng purchased 3,700 dan, and Yuanda purchased 1,300 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Contract | Highest Price | Lowest Price | Closing Price | Change from Previous Day | Existing Inventory</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>

<p>Total |  |  |  |  | 725,400</p>
<p>(Factory Demand is Relatively Weak) Current cotton sales are relatively slow, but British factories' buying interest is very strong, and market prices are quite stable. Sources include 110 bales of Yao cotton, 500 bales of Tong cotton, and the current cotton is as follows:</p>
<p>Tianjin American cotton 50.50, Yihua factory purchased 12 pieces and sent them to the factory. Shaanxi cotton 45.00, Yihua factory purchased 4,000 pieces and sent them to the factory. Shaanxi</p>

<h3 id="e267">SUPPLEMENTARY RECORD OF AMERICAN COTTON TELEGRAMS <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially strengthened due to favorable Liverpool news, but then softened due to positive Western forecasts, and finally rebounded due to some short covering. As a result, spot prices remained unchanged, and futures rose by one to two pounds. English cotton rose by four to ten points. Indian cotton rose due to short covering, purchases by Japanese merchants and speculators. Consequently, Pingar rose 2 rupees, Oomra rose 2 rupees 7.5 annas, and Broach White rose 2 rupees 8.75 annas. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 29th): American cotton compared to the previous day in national currency, English cotton compared to the previous day in national currency: 7.1144 rose 2.47, 0.05606 rose 1.05, 1.116414 rose 4.80, 0.07603651 rose 1.60, 1.117614 rose 4.83, 0.08602651 rose 1.50, 1.118114 rose 4.85, 0.1599551 rose 1.20, 3.119114 rose 4.89, 0.12450.905120114 rose 4.93, spot 1.1160 flat 4.76. Indian cotton in national currency: Pingar 124.50 rose 2.00, 26.80; Oomra 178.25 rose 2.75, 35.60; Broach White 200.25 rose 2.875, 39.90.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was closed. English cotton futures rose by one point. Indian cotton initially rose due to purchases by Japanese merchants, but then retreated due to sales by some brokers. As a result, Pingar remained unchanged, Oomra rose by half a rupee, and Broach White rose by 2.5 annas. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 30th):</p>
<p>English cotton compared to the previous day in national currency: 5.607 rose 1, 52.00; 7.604 rose 1, 51.70; 8.602 flat, 51.50; 15.99 flat, 51.20; 12.597 rose 1, 5.00. Indian cotton compared to the previous day in national currency: Pingar 124.50 flat, 26.90; Oomra 178.75 rose 0.50, 35.00; Broach White 200.50, 0.25, 0.20.</p>
<h3 id="e269">GRAINS: NEGLIGIBLE VOLUME OF POWDER FUTURES DELIVERY <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the delivery date for flour futures, but the market for futures was weak, and the delivery of spot flour was also minimal. This was because most transactions were settled directly before the futures period, due to slow actual sales by the merchant groups, and factories also took the opportunity to buy back in small quantities. However, there were still 2,000 bags from the Pao Tai brand that had not been directly settled before the futures period, and were delivered in full yesterday, and received by retail investors. There was no market for wheat futures yesterday. However, the marked wheat for this month has not been sold for a long time, so there was no settlement at the end of the month. However, there were many spot soybean settlements at the Grain Exchange, totaling 71 carts. 1,500 bags of spot wheat were opened, priced at 3 yuan to 2.91 yuan, all of which were cart wheat and were purchased by Fuxin. New wheat samples have already been seen, quoted at 3.45 yuan per Shen, from Nanjing Pukou.</p>
<h3 id="e270">KE-XIAN AND MIN-HUA RICE BECOME POPULAR AGAIN <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Ke-Xian rice market, after being popular for days, had already entered a stable trend. The amount arriving yesterday was not much, and the purchasing by merchants from Fujian province was active again, so the market seemed to have returned to a stable position. More than 5,000 bags were traded throughout the day, with 3,800 bags purchased by Fuzhou merchants, 800 bags by Quanzhou merchants, and 200-300 bags each by merchants from this street and Zhejiang province. The market prices were similar to the previous market, but the underlying trend was slightly firm. If not much more arrives in the future, the Ke-Hua market will easily change again.</p>
<h3 id="e271">NANJING NEW RAPESEED APPEARS ON THE MARKET <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the first batch of 106 bags of new rapeseed from Nanjing arrived, with a price of 4 yuan. The quality of the goods was good, but the amount of mud and ash mixed in was too heavy, and it may be difficult to sell at the original price in the future market. Today the weather is sunny, and the quality of later products will inevitably be better. It is hoped that the production area will improve the screening and cleaning. The market price in Beijing can be sold higher by a few yuan. Except for the Hankou cart soybeans, which rose by 4-5 cents due to the scarcity of goods ("previous day's opening price was 2.78 yuan"), the rest were firm and stable. High-grade Zhengyangguan soybeans were around 3 yuan, and medium-quality goods fluctuated by 2-3 cents. Yesterday, the market was slightly softened by the telegram drop, but fortunately, the factory demand was still continuous, and the amount arriving was scarce, so the market was tight.</p>
<h3 id="e272">SUGAR MARKET: TI-ZHUANG QING SUGAR OPENS UP BY FOUR CENTS <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market remained relatively flat due to the firmness of Customs Gold Units. The guild's indicative price for No. 24 crude sugar white spot goods was 26 yuan, with few sellers. Transit goods were 6.75 yuan, and bonded goods were 6.70 yuan. Dutch red and Taikoo sugar remained unchanged. The factory's Grade 1 refined white sugar was 19.12 yuan. Some Chaozhou merchants quoted Ti-Zhuang Qing sugar at 12.8 yuan, an increase of 4 cents from the previous price, with a subsequent asking price of 13 yuan. Huanggang Qing sugar was 12.2 yuan, and secondary grades were 12.05 to 12 yuan. Over a hundred bags of Zhiyang white sugar were offered at 15.1 yuan. Hong Kong and Guangdong merchants offered 500 boxes of Shimen Pianqing sugar at 10.05 yuan, an increase of 2 cents. Beihai Pianqing sugar was quoted at 10 yuan, but no transaction was made. Huizhou foreign white sugar was offered at over 300 bags, 13.4 yuan, with a subsequent asking price of 13.6 yuan. There were rumors that another 2,000 bags of Xinghua red sugar were arriving.</p>
<h3 id="e273">NORTH-SOUTH GOODS: GOLDEN MOUNTAIN BRANCHES PLUMMET, THEN PARTIALLY RECOVER <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>Since the price of Golden Mountain branches fell, the degree of decline has exceeded half of the original price. The reason for the sharp drop is that there are hopes for a bumper harvest of this year's new branches. Who knew that the market situation would suddenly change? According to letters from the production area, the recent lychees have suffered from insect pests and have been damaged by wind and rain, resulting in significant losses. Therefore, the market here has rebounded. It is said that the quoted price has risen by two to three yuan, but the trading price is still chaotic and has not yet risen excessively.</p>
<h3 id="e274">MID-GRADE RED DATES SOLD OUT IMMEDIATELY UPON ARRIVAL <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>Mid-grade red dates have been selling briskly recently, and the inventory is extremely scarce. For example, Haozhou red dates are already out of stock. It is said that several hundred bags will arrive in the next batch, and prices are bound to rise. The source of Fu red dates is not much. Because the Wenzhou and Taizhou merchants have a strong appetite, they are sold out as soon as they arrive, and the price has risen to 7 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e275">SILK AND TEA: LOW PRICES FOR NEW SILKWORM COCOONS IN JIANGSU AND ZHEJIANG <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>(Shaoxing New Cocoons Arrive, Prices are Slightly Strong) The Shaoxing cocoon markets have been open for many days, and late silkworm cocoons have been listed. Late cocoons are mostly improved varieties with better quality. The market arrivals are gradually becoming active, but the cocoon markets are suppressing prices because they see that overseas silk prices have fallen again. Improved cocoons are only 25 to 30 yuan, and native cocoons are 15 to 25 yuan. Silkworm farmers have heavy leaf costs and are suffering losses. (Xiaoshan Cocoon Harvest Varies) The Xiaoshan silkworm harvest varies from village to village. Improved cocoons in the model areas of the eastern village are more abundant and of better quality. In the northwestern village, the native silkworms have run away seriously, with only 30-40% harvest, and the cocoons are of inferior quality. Only 23 cocoon markets in the whole county have opened, and they have been weighing cocoons for 4-5 days. The cocoon price is not high. The highest price for improved quality cocoons is only 35 yuan, and the highest price for native cocoons is 25 yuan.</p>
<p>(Haining Silkworm Farmers Reel Native Silk Themselves) Haining is a famous silk area, and new cocoons have been on the market for many days. Cocoon markets are offering low prices. Improved cocoons are only 30 yuan, and native cocoons are 20 yuan. Silkworm farmers are losing a lot of money, and many are reeling native silk themselves. Cocoon markets have only received tens to more than a hundred dan in a few days.</p>
<p>(Jintan Builds New-Style Cocoon Markets) Jintan County is a model silkworm area, and this year's silkworm harvest is expected to be bountiful again. The Jintan County Government has been ordered to build four new-style cocoon markets in the eastern village of Shuibei Town, the southern village of Shetou Town, the western village of Dongdalin, and the northern village of Zhongtang Town. They have jointly invested with major silk cocoon merchants in Wuxi to purchase four cocoon drying machines in Shanghai, worth more than 75,000 yuan, and have already transported them to various markets for installation. It is said that cocoon markets using machine-dried cocoons (using diesel) are being used for the first time in our country.</p>
<p>(New Style Cocoons from Chang'an Have Been Shipped to Shanghai) The new cocoons from Hangshao area of Zhejiang have been listed earliest. The fresh cocoons collected by the cocoon markets in Chang'an and other places have been baked into dry cocoons and delivered to the Huitong Transportation Company for shipment to Shanghai. There are dozens of packages of sample cocoons (both improved and native varieties) for testing. It is said that the shrinkage of fresh cocoons after baking is not great, averaging only 90 catties of dry cocoons for every 100 catties of fresh cocoons.</p>
<h3 id="e276">OIL MARKET: WHITE TUNG OIL GRADUALLY RISES <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>Foreign firms in Hankou continue to purchase white tung oil. After rising from 28 yuan to 29 yuan last week, oil merchants declared that they would not sell unless the price was 29.34 yuan. This week, foreign firms bought 200-300 tons at 29.4 yuan. Then, Hankou merchants wanted to sell at 29.8 yuan. Last night, it was reported from Hankou that foreign firms had purchased at 30 yuan, which shows that foreign firms' need for goods has been completely exposed. Therefore, the prices of goods from Hankou have also risen in tandem. Local tung oil has increased from 24 yuan to 25 yuan, and South Branch oil with taxes has also risen to 24.78 yuan. It is undeniable that the market is continuing to rise. However, now that foreign firms have reached 30 yuan, I don't think there will be any more surprises. Although the situation is different this year from previous years, it is still early in the season. Even if the production in the producing areas is lacking, the inventory will not be too thin. Although the source is scarce, there is no need to worry about interruption of supply. Even if foreign firms need goods urgently, there should be enough goods to supply. Therefore, even if it rises to more than 30 yuan, I am afraid it will be limited. However, after the rise, it is not easy to expect a return to relaxation. Although there may be small ups and downs, a big drop is hopeless. Therefore, everyone knows that the tung oil market this year has become a situation where it is easy to rise and difficult to fall. Hangzhou tung oil has been following the advances and retreats of the Hankou market. In the past two days, Hangzhou merchants wanted to sell at 20 yuan per stone, delivered in this port. However, merchants in this port did not want to chase the trend because they saw that domestic sales were not strong and the inventory was still available. Therefore, there were very few transactions. However, seeing that the Hankou market has risen again, they may be interested. But since another rise is feared to be limited, they are hesitating cautiously.</p>
<h3 id="e277">THE REASONS FOR THE SUDDEN RISE IN TUNG OIL <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>Tung oil, which has been in a slump, has suddenly turned higher. From spring to summer, there has been hardly a day when it has not been falling. Hankou Jing oil closed last winter at around 20 yuan per dan. After the beginning of spring, it went downhill day by day. At the beginning of last week, it was only selling for around 13 yuan. The lowest price for Macheng oil was 12.23 yuan. Who would have thought that people still expected it to be cheaper? All the markets were considered to have no possibility of turning around. Who knew that the inventories everywhere were already fixed, and there were many people who wanted to buy. Therefore, as soon as there was a start, everyone raised their prices together. According to the Hankou market, 4,000-5,000 pieces of Macheng oil have been sold since last week, with prices ranging from 12.34 yuan to 14 yuan. Heavy Jing oil rose from 13.23 yuan to 14.56 yuan. In total, there were over 10,000 pieces sold from the five categories of Jing, Zhi, Jin, Cha, and Ma. The buyers were from Shanghai, Ningbo, Suzhou, and Zhenjiang. The more it falls, the less people pay attention to it. As soon as there is a start, everyone will rush to buy. However, since the market has risen, buyers are also gradually constrained. Therefore, the current rising wind has seen a slight decline, and it can probably stand firm for a while.</p>

<h3 id="e278">"Diary of the Wei Shui Xuan" <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— Shu</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>I have three different editions of Li Rihua's diary in my collection. The first one I bought was the abridged version of "Xiao Juan Congshu" by Li Hanzhi (Li Rihua's great-grandson). It has a preface by the master of the Pianshi studio, Li Zhaoheng (Li Rihua's son), and Li Hanzhi, as well as a postscript by Zhuan Xiong, Ge Yuanxu. Later, I bought the complete edition engraved and printed by Jiayetang of the Liu family in Wuxing. In addition to Li Zhaoheng's preface, it also has postscripts by Wanwen Jushi and Liu Chengan. Liu's postscript describes the process of obtaining this manuscript in detail. The abridged version contains 155 entries, which is about two-eighths of the entire book. Last year, I also saw the Ming dynasty "Li Zhu Lan, Mr. Commentary", which includes three diaries: "Xi Zhao Lu," "Li Bai Yue Ji," and "Ji Xuan Lu." Among them, "Li Bai Yue Ji" was extracted from the complete manuscript, being the complete manuscript from April 5th to May 29th of the forty-second year of Wanli. "Xi Zhao" and "Ji Xuan" were written in the fifth year of Tianqi and after the complete manuscript of Jiayetang, but they do not have any particular advantages. The content of the diary, "starting from Yiyou in Wanli to Bingchen, divided by years. It records the review of poems and essays, the appraisal of calligraphy and paintings, and incidentally involves mountains, rivers, objects, plants, and tea" (master of the Pianshi studio). The language is concise and rhythmic. In the diary literature, it is a good book.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>When reading the diaries of ancient people, the most important thing is of course to understand the author's life. "From the late years of Emperor Shenzong of the Ming Dynasty, court officials formed factions and attacked each other. Rihua alone kept himself clean and retired, devoting himself to reading. Outside the dust and filth, he seemed to have found contentment" (Liu's postscript). Therefore, the life reflected in his diary is particularly characterized by a recluse style. He liked to travel in mountains and rivers, such as "On the eleventh day, He Xiaoyan and Yue Ji had a boat trip to invite me, mooring at the Rain Mist Pavilion. At that time, fragments of ice on the river touched the boat, and the setting sun shone on them like碎玉. Thousands of willows on the shore, with cold branches piercing the sky, travelers were nowhere to be seen. I thought it was clear, empty, and bright, surpassing this time, and surpassing the spring river moon night." Both his trips to Baiyue and Qiyun fully show his interests. He liked to grow flowers, and the diary mentions this aspect, such as "Whenever I am tired of reading, I walk among the flowers with a cane, winding and turning, which is very interesting. From then on, the shade of the trees, the color of the bamboo, the songs of the birds, and the fragrance of the flowers seem to be particularly abundant." Like "I drank a little wine with Shen Qian, Dai Shengheng, and my son under the flowers. At that time, seven or eight trees of red peach trees were like sitting in a cloud curtain, and two cranes danced with snowy feathers reflecting in between. The scenery was excellent, and Shen Qian's thoughts advanced rapidly, making it full of imagination." Gardens and mountains and rivers were Li Rihua's highest life interest. Therefore, in addition to visiting mountains and rivers and appreciating flowers, he also used a lot of effort to arrange his garden. He bought a pebble for more than 50,000 yuan to pave the ground, and bought 40 stones, "the large ones like crouching lions, and the small ones like lying foxes" to decorate the "mountain forest atmosphere," not afraid of the labor of "measuring the ropes and ink with the craftsmen, and the plasterers comparing the heights and lows, the fullness and narrowness." He was also particularly particular about food and drink. For example, drinking water: "The water carrier from Huishan returned, and I got more than 20 urns of new spring water. Five days ago, Zhaodu Yunshan's old monk sent me a bottle of pre-Qingming new buds. I opened it for a test, and the color, fragrance, and taste were all excellent." For example, food: "Shen Qian and Boyuan sent 40 yellow sparrows, fat, white, fresh, and crisp. I got the earliest taste of them. I drank at night and poured two cans." In his diary, we can simply organize a list of his favorite food and drink. Shen Zhou once said to Li Rihua: "I am about to burn all the books of Lu here, close the door and plant bamboo, so that the business will continue without interruption, and spread the unofficial history and miscellaneous sayings underneath, indulging in wine, laughter, and song." Li Rihua's personal life was actually like this: a retired aristocrat, a wealthy literati, relying on his wealth and the special skills of poetry and painting, escaped the "noise of the world" and lived a happy life.</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>Regarding academic records in "Diary of Wei Bing Xuan", the main ones are on painting, as well as copying painting inscriptions, poems, and lyrics, which account for about two-halves of the entire book. For example, "On the twenty-second day, I went with Wan Xiang to view the large Chrysanthemum Irrigation painting by Lu Shuping of the countryside. The mountain ridges are steep, and the trees are sparse. Generally, the style of Zihou is used. The thatched cottage is located on a flat hill, surrounded by thin fences, and the trees are arranged in rows. Across the water, there is a pavilion, which is empty and can be seen. Two boys carry water and irrigate, one boy scoops water from the stream and pours it into the container, and two old men sit in front of the hall, one stroking the qin and the other hugging his knees, extremely spiritual. At the foot of the distant peaks of the back mountain, a pavilion stands tall, with a stone and fence foot. Small five-colored dots are used to gather into cold buds, shaking like the setting sun reflecting its light, and the light breeze brushing its posture. It is signed, 'Made by Lu Zhi of Baoshan on the ninth day of the ninth month of Renshen in the Canying Pavilion'". This type of writing about paintings is what Li Rihua is best at: detailed, concise, and extremely vivid. In addition, it is a book that deserves our attention in the diary. It introduces several leisure books and several masterpieces of essays. Although he is not entirely happy with leisure books, he has read "Jin Ping Mei" and his comment is: "Generally speaking, it is the most filthy thing in the market, and its sharpness is far less than "Water Margin". Yuan Zhonglang praised it extremely, but it is also an exaggeration of her strangeness". Not only did he express dissatisfaction with Zhonglang's praise of "Jin Ping Mei", he also did not agree with the literature of the Public Security School, like his teacher Chen Meigong. This can also be seen in the diary: "On the second day, it rained. I read the collection of Xu Wenchang. Yuan Zhonglang and Hongdao praised him as one of the contemporary people. However, his person is filthy and has strange qi, but he is not elegant. If it is poetry, it is vulgar and strange, very similar to Zhonglang, so there is a combination of stench. The zaju "Four Cries of the Ape" is a wonderful hand." He had read "Lamp Flower Granny" and "Laughing Record." His opinion on the "Laughing Record" was: "Although it is full of vulgar and mixed words from the market, after being provoked by it, it is extremely interesting, and a narrative is also humorous and pleasing," and he copied the original preface. In addition, he also talked about the three books "Xianyou", "Mengyou", and "Aoyou", citing the opinions of his friend Gu Zhu: "Recently published strange books, there are "Mengyou" and "Xianyou" two records, not words or legends, but 媪弹琵调也 while still have deep meanings. It is said that they were written by Yang Lianfu when he avoided the land in Jiangnan. There is also "Xiayou Lu" that has not been seen. Gu Zhu also said, "Our Ming Dynasty is behind the ancients in everything. What is outstanding is only tea, wine, ink, and the song of hitting dates", which is exactly the general view of the gentlemen at the time. There is one thing in the diary that is quite strange, that is, it says: Lu Fangweng also wrote a kind of "Shuchu Ji", and it is better than ("Shu Ru Ji"). But is it true or false? As far as I know, Fangweng has no such work.</p>
<h3 id="e279">ON THE MATTER OF QIN LIZHAI'S WIFE <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— Gong Han</p>
<p>In recent years, articles about suicides due to economic oppression and moral constraints have been frequently seen in newspapers, but few people speak out or write about these. Only the suicide of Qin Lizhai's wife and her four children has caused quite a stir. Later, there was even a suicide victim who was carrying this news story, which shows its great influence. I think this is because there are many people. Single suicides are no longer enough to attract everyone's attention.</p>
<p>In all the echoes, although Qin's wife, the mastermind of the suicide, was treated with leniency, the conclusion was nothing more than condemnation. Because 丨丨commentators say丨丨although society is dark, the first responsibility of life is to survive. Suicide is a dereliction of duty. The second responsibility is to suffer. Suicide is seeking ease. Progressive commentators say that life is a battle. Suicide is desertion. Even death is not enough to cover up the crime. This can naturally be said, but it is too general.</p>
<p>There are criminologists who say that crime is due to the environment, and others say it is due to the individual. The latter saying is now popular, because if we believe the former, then eliminating criminals would require transforming the environment, which would be troublesome and scary. The critics of Qin's wife's suicide mostly belong to the latter.</p>
<p>Indeed, since she committed suicide, it proves that she is weak. But how did she become weak? It is important that we look at her father's letters, which scared her with the reputations of both families and moved her with the spirit's words of the deceased. We also have to look at her younger brother's eulogy: 'Wife died for her husband, children died for their mother...' Isn't there a great sense of regarding it as a beautiful story for the ages? How can a person who grows up and is nurtured in such a family not become weak? We certainly cannot start to blame for struggle, but the power of darkness to devour is often greater than that of a lone army. Moreover, the critics of suicide may not be supporters of struggle. When others are struggling, when they are struggling, when they are defeated, they may be silent. In remote rural areas or cities, how many orphans, widows, poor women, and laborers die obediently, or although they resist, they finally have to die? But who has ever spoken up or touched anyone's heart? It is truly 'they commit suicide in the ditches and no one knows it'!</p>
<p>People should of course survive, but for the sake of evolution. They may as well suffer, but for the sake of resolving all future suffering. They should fight even more, but for the sake of reform. Those who condemn the suicides of others should, while condemning others, also challenge and attack the environment that drives people to suicide.</p>
<h3 id="e280">Record of a Visit to a Friend in Wuxi <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan</p>
<p>After Lady Lizhai and her daughter-in-law committed suicide together with medicine, I figured my old friend Pingfu must be experiencing extraordinary grief due to this family tragedy. I often considered ways to console him, but also feared further hurting the old man's feelings, so I hesitated to visit. Recently, a friend came from Wuxi and described Pingfu's recent condition, saying that his grief had lessened somewhat and he could勉强 see guests lately. The local authorities in the area were also concerned about the burial site for Mr. and Mrs. Lizhai, planning to use the funds originally allocated for Danruo School's expenses to subsidize the funeral, and wanted to discuss this with the old man. I accepted this mission and took the express train at 1 PM on the 26th, arriving in Wuxi at 4 PM. Upon arrival, I saw a sea of people outside the city, and when I asked, I learned that it was the Qingshan Temple Fair. and it would be followed by an all-night celebration, with people coming to watch from dozens of miles around. Asking about the reason for the temple fair, they said: (During the rampant Japanese pirate disturbances at the end of the Ming Dynasty, Wang Qiqin, the magistrate of Wuxi, concerned that the pirates would come to Wuxi to plunder, urgently supervised the workers to quickly build the city walls of Wuxi. As soon as the work was completed, the pirates arrived, and he led the local guard and civilians to defend against them. In the first battle, they were defeated, with thirty-six people killed. Subsequently, they gathered the people again and fought the pirates in the suburbs, defeating them greatly and preserving the entire city. Therefore, the local people admired him, and every year they held a fair to commemorate him. This year, because Japan's ambition to invade is increasingly rampant, the people of Wuxi's accumulated resentment is being vented through this fair, so it is particularly grand.) I usually dread commotion, and also feared road closures on my visit to my friend, so I went to bed early at No. 66 Wuxi Hotel.</p>
<p>The next morning at eight o'clock, I first went to Ronghu Villa Jiufeng Flour Mill to visit Mr. Cai Songru, only to learn that he had already gone to Shanghai yesterday. Our timing was off, which was very disappointing. Then I immediately went to Mr. Pingfu's outside residence at the foot of Lǐ City, and saw Pingfu's concubine. She said that Pingfu had gone out early to seek medicine because his young son was suffering from complications after the measles and was in great danger. (Pingfu's concubine has one son and one daughter, the son is nine years old and the daughter is eleven.) I was shocked and thought, how unlucky Pingfu is! So I immediately took my leave and went to the old residence in Xiaolou Lane to first meet Mr. Qin Xiaolu (Yuliu). Xiaolu is Pingfu's cousin and also an old friend of mine. Without exchanging pleasantries, I urgently asked about Pingfu's young nephew's illness, and Xiaolu said: "By the grace of Heaven, he is out of danger this morning. The past two days, the fever after the measles did not subside, and the Chinese medicine doctors were helpless. Yesterday, we changed to a Western doctor, and after taking the medicine, the fever subsided by evening and he is fine now." My heart was slightly relieved. Then I asked about Lady Lizhai's matter, whether the cause was exactly as the newspaper said? Xiaolu said: "Besides the two points mentioned in the newspaper, the deep affection between the couple and the discord with the mother-in-law, I absolutely do not know of any other reasons. Moreover, I had never heard of the so-called discord with the mother-in-law before. When Lizhai got married, she was still in school. The family was reunited, harmonious and peaceful. Everyone in our Qin clan envied Pingfu's family's happiness. Later, Lizhai went to Shanghai to work, and my niece-in-law Yin Xia also went to Shanghai. In recent years, every time I received news from Shanghai, they all said that Lizhai and his wife were virtuous, capable, and hardworking, able to support themselves, and often provided for the elders. Therefore, I initially did not know that there were disagreements between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. It was not until Yin Xia died and Pingfu's letter was published in the newspaper that I asked Pingfu about it. Pingfu said, 'On the surface, of course, the mother-in-law is kind and the daughter-in-law is filial, but in the hidden details, it is difficult for me to say.'" All I know is this. Xiaolu also said that my sister-in-law (Pingfu's wife) has recently returned to Wuxi from Shanhai, accompanied by her two daughters and two sons-in-law. The news of the deaths of Lizhai, Yin Xia, etc., was initially concealed from my sister-in-law. When she returned, they told her about Lizhai's death. My sister-in-law suddenly said: "If Lizhai died, my daughter-in-law Yin Xia must be dead!" I have always known their personalities; if the daughter-in-law dies, Lizhai will definitely die; if Lizhai dies, the daughter-in-law will not live alone. What exactly happened? Don't hide it from me!" Then they told her that Yin Xia had indeed died, and she stomped her feet and said: "Xiduan and Jue will also definitely die, the grandchildren's personalities are the same as their parents." Then they told her everything. At that time, my sister-in-law's grief and agitation, the tragic scene, I cannot bear to describe again. Fortunately, her daughters, sons-in-law, and family members tried their best to persuade and comfort her, and she is still under persuasion and prevention. I was very surprised at how deeply Pingfu's wife knew her son and daughter-in-law's personalities. At that time, Pingfu's two sons-in-law, one Gong and one Li, came out to see me, both gentle and capable. My friend, the old man, should be somewhat comforted, right? During the conversation, Pingfu arrived upon hearing the news, panting and hoarse, and we could hardly say a word to each other. Xiaolu explained my intentions on my behalf, and gradually touched upon the matter of Lady Lizhai's death. Pingfu said: "Alas! I initially had no intention of forcing my daughter-in-law to return to Wuxi. It was only because relatives all said: 'A widow and orphan, living alone in Shanghai, with no one to take care of them, how can I feel at ease?' I was also concerned about this, so I called them back. But who would have thought that it would come to this?" (I heard that in front of the spirits of Mr. and Mrs. Lizhai and their grandchildren, besides making two elegiac couplets to hang, there were also two plaques, one saying "Heaven, what sin have they committed?" and the other saying "Why did it come to this?" Both expressed the meaning of having grievances that could not be expressed). Having said this, he burst into tears. I dared not ask any further questions. Finally, I conveyed the intentions of the local authorities, asking if there was a burial site and whether the burial could be done this year? Xiaolu turned to Pingfu and said: "Strange, last night I dreamed that Lizhai, Yin Jin, and Xiduan Jue were sitting around a table, as if discussing something. Brother (referring to Pingfu) seemed to be among them as well. I was surprised that I did not know what they were discussing. Now that Mo Gong has come and mentioned this, could this be the matter?" Pingfu: "This must be settled quickly to put the dead at peace." He also said: "In our Qin family, according to past precedents, any children who die before the age of twenty cannot be buried in the order of generations. It seems that we cannot stick to the precedents this time, because Mr. and Mrs. Lizhai must want their children to live together in one place." Pingfu said: "Yes, there are no remaining burial plots in my ancestors' tombs. I myself must find another burial site. Together with Mr. and Mrs. Lizhai and their grandchildren, we must have a large plot of land for seven or eight coffins, so it will be difficult to find one at once." Xiaolu said: "The old tombs of the Qin family are all in Huishan, but now the prices in Huishan are expensive and there is no space to find. I think it is okay to go a little further, such as Yuantouzhu and other places, where prices are cheaper and easier to find. When I have some free time, I will help you find it." Pingfu said: "I must settle this matter this winter."</p>
<p>It was already noon. Xiaolu said: "Jinhua is returning to Wuxi today, and I have invited him to talk together. But the messenger returned and said that he had gone to Huishan." So we had lunch at Xiaolu's place. Those at the same table were me, Xiaolu, Pingfu, Xiaolu's son-in-law, and Pingfu's two sons-in-law. After the meal, Xiaolu said: "It is rare for you to come, and I have been living in seclusion for a long time. I was just thinking of going out for a tour. Pingfu is very depressed, please accompany us for a tour to relieve his mind, okay?" I dared not refuse, so we hired a car and first went to Mei Garden, sipping tea in the Songyan Hall and wandering for a long time. Then we went up to Taihu Hotel, leaning on the railing and looking out for a long time. The scenery was indeed very good, but none of us were in the mood for sightseeing today. And because it was already late, we did not go to Yuantouzhu, but turned back to Wuxi Hotel, sat and talked for a while. Pingfu and Xiaolu shook hands to say goodbye and left. I rested for a while in the apartment, and at 8:20, I went to the station to take the express train back to Shanghai. When I was about to leave, Mr. Jinhua sent a messenger to invite me to dinner, but because I was in a hurry to get on the train, I declined, feeling very apologetic.</p>
<p>In the train, I thought to myself: The Qin family is a harmonious and cheerful family. Yin Xia's parents-in-law are not comparable to the usual unreasonable people. There were no economic problems, but Yin Xia died like this! She led her children to die so calmly! Was her death, as some sympathizers say, commendable? Or, as critics say, was it unnecessary? This question lingered in my mind until the train wheels stopped, and my doubts were still unresolved.</p>

<p>— Caoming</p>
<p>Similarly, A'mei went with an inquiring and trembling heart to accept this strong and crude man who spent all his labor in the fields during the day and snored loudly when he returned at night.</p>
<p>"Why are you afraid of me? Now, I am your husband." A'han said to A'mei with primitive crookedness and unaccustomed tenderness. However, she seemed even more clumsy in front of this strange and stubborn man. When her husband embraced her forcefully and warmly, she cried.</p>
<p>"Hey! You are not a child anymore, why are you crying? Ah, is there something that makes you uncomfortable?" the man lowered his head and asked in a low voice, holding his breath.</p>
<p>She raised her head, her moist and shimmering eyes staring at the man's face, her lips trembling with a smile she hadn't tried in ten years, and began to utter her clear voice:</p>
<p>"I know now, the world is still a little warm!"</p>
<p>After a short period, A'mei, like the rest of the women, lively carried the rice bucket to the fields. When she saw her husband, there were many words stored on the edge of her lips. She even planned to send the words that she was not used to burning rice stalks and her eyes were red and painful to her husband's ears one by one, but she became shy in the eyes of the men and women in the neighboring gardens and fields. When she was about to start packing up to go back, she said with a gentle smile:</p>
<p>(Don't eat a little more? Um, I prepared a handkerchief for you to wipe your mouth).</p>
<p>The husband glanced at his wife who was reluctant to leave, but he held a cigarette and walked away.</p>
<p>The mother-in-law had eaten dinner, holding her water pipe and pacing out the door to find her conversational partner.</p>
<p>(Fourth Aunt, is your daughter-in-law obedient?) The old woman next door's face was full of complimentary smiles.</p>
<p>(Um, it's not too bad,) the mother-in-law loaded her water pipe, took a puff, and the white, pungent smoke came out of her nostrils, quickly rolled over her half-closed eyes, and gradually dissipated. (It's like a plow cow, you can't say it has any disadvantages, but it only takes one step after being hit, it's very stupid!)</p>
<p>(Forget it, why do women need to be so smart? Have you forgotten that A'gui, the wife of Third Uncle's wife, wasn't she scolding her husband all day for only smoking opium and scolding her mother-in-law for controlling her, and eventually ran away with a wild man?...)</p>
<p>(That's right! But what about the next generation? How can such a stupid mother raise clever children? The next generation is important!)</p>
<p>The summer sun, woke up in the morning, raised its strong arms adorned with many scorching silver needles, stretched lazily, and shook the light onto the earth. Every day, on a huge yellow-green plain, farmers with bare backs and muscles shining with purple-bronze light, wipe the sweat from their faces and run faithfully and warmly, looking at the solid rice fields and singing monotonous and cheerful country songs. Until the sun comfortably covers its face with gray-yellow silk, and fatigue invades the bodies of every worker.</p>

<h3 id="e283">On Arrears of Official Telegrams <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>In an article published in this journal, Mr. Lü Bing discusses "the pauperization of telegrams." Based on telegram business statistics, official and military telegrams account for more than 70%, commercial telegrams account for 20%, and private telegrams account for less than 10%. He argues that telegrams are aristocratic and are the reason why China's telecommunications industry cannot develop, which is a valid point. However, the congestion of official and military telegrams is actually due to the tense military work, frequent transfers, and numerous military dispatches. Only telegrams can be relied on. When the political situation is clear and the military affairs are over, official telegrams will naturally decrease. The telecommunications authorities feel the pain most acutely not because of the large number of official telegrams, but because many official telegrams are not paid for.</p>
<p>Although China's telecommunications is said to be operated by the state, it has not received any subsidies from the national treasury. Therefore, its business policy has to be self-sufficient. It relies solely on telegraph fee income for funding. The maintenance of lines, the purchase of materials, the salaries of employees, and the administrative expenses all require huge sums of money. When there are more commercial telegrams, it can still be勉强 supported. However, in recent years, the domestic economy has gone bankrupt, all industries are depressed, and the telegram business has declined accordingly. Salary arrears are common in the majority of cases, and it is difficult to maintain the status quo. The way to increase revenue and reduce expenditure is to sort out the arrears of official telegrams.</p>
<p>The following table compares official and commercial telegrams for the years 19, 20, and 21.</p>
<p>Comparison Table of the Number of Words in Domestic Official and Commercial Telegrams</p>
<p>Year, Chinese Government Telegrams, Foreign Language (i.e. Official Telegrams)</p>
<p>Year, Chinese Government Telegrams, Foreign Language (i.e. Official Telegrams)</p>
<p>Nineteenth year, 96,450,624, 788,816</p>
<p>Twentieth year, 106,058,809, 703,043</p>
<p>Twenty-first year, 99,462,349, 599,122</p>
<p>From the above table, it can be seen that the number of official telegrams is more than twice that of commercial telegrams every year. The quantity is so large, and many are prefixed with the words "Urgent" and "Limited to Immediate Arrival," which are as urgent as sparks of fire and should be sent in advance. Although commercial telegrams pay cash, they have to be backlogged behind. Therefore, when military affairs are tense, commercial telegrams are often delayed.</p>
<p>Official telegrams only charge half the fee, which is already cheaper than commercial telegrams. Recently, due to the suppression of bandits, there are provisions for material fees for military telegrams, charging only five cents per hundred words. If the payment can be made in accordance with the regulations, the telegraph bureau can still be funded a little, increasing the repair of lines, improving machines, increasing manpower, and improving equipment, then there will be no backlog of commercial telegrams. However, in fact, even the few cents of material fees that should be paid are often not paid. According to telecommunications statistics, the total revenue and expenditure of wired telegraphs in the 19th year had a surplus of more than 3,354,000 yuan, while the arrears of official telegrams reached more than 3,440,000 yuan. In the 20th year, the book surplus was more than 4,928,000 yuan, while the arrears of official telegrams reached more than 4,850,000 yuan. From the establishment of the National Government to December of the 21st year, the arrears of official telegrams totaled more than 16,977,000 yuan. Last year's arrears were also around 3 million yuan. When we read this statistical figure, we should be shocked and amazed at the difficulty of maintaining telecommunications.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for the arrears of official telegrams: (1) Due to the habit of previous years: In the era of warlord governments, the telecommunications bureau was regarded as a tax revenue agency, and the director was mostly appointed by them, so the army's telegrams were permanently recorded in the account. Even if it was not appointed by them, in order to maintain relations with the warlords and preserve their position, they did not dare to demand payment for the arrears of official telegrams, letting them be natural. Therefore, the military believes that free telegrams are a privileged right, and the telecommunications bureau also believes that military telegrams have a precedent for preferential treatment. Some military forces even force the telecommunications bureau to send telegrams without paying a penny, on the pretext of military emergency. If they argue with them, they are accused of "interfering with military opportunities." This kind of bad habit has been going on for a long time. (2) Due to frequent private corruption: The telecommunications bureau has previously adopted a laissez-faire policy for official telegrams, and unscrupulous supervisors take this opportunity to engage in private corruption, either reporting more and less, or concealing the entire number of reports, or requesting the military to give them private subsidies or private errands as conditions for waiving telegram fees. Or the telecommunications bureau and the military personnel in charge collude to cheat, deliberately making things difficult, and when urging for collection, they manipulate each other, and when calculating, they collude with each other. Huge sums of money go into private pockets, and telegram fees are still in the public account. The telecommunications bureau has the name of arrears, and the military has no savings. Now, after several thorough investigations by the Ministry of Communications and severe punishment, this trend has been slightly curbed. (3) Due to the financial difficulties of the sending agencies: In recent years, military affairs have been frequent, the number of troops is large, the national treasury is empty, and the military pay is in arrears, resulting in financial difficulties for various agencies and troops, and the failure to pay the telegram fees in full is also one of the reasons for the arrears.</p>
<p>The telecommunications economy is struggling entirely because of the arrears of official telegrams. If all the payments are made in cash as described above, the annual revenue of the telecommunications administration will increase by at least two to three million yuan. If this huge sum is used to build new lines, add new machines, train key personnel, and sort out telecommunications assets, everything will be plentiful and all industries will be revived. If so, it will also be possible to continue to reduce the current quotation slightly to facilitate the public. If official telegrams cannot be paid in cash, then the telecommunications expenses are entirely borne by the general public who send telegrams, which is unreasonable. In addition to the accumulated losses, there will inevitably be a day when the national telecommunications will go bankrupt. This not only violates the principles of national public enterprises, but also violates the principles of national economy.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications is now paying close attention to official and military telegrams. On the one hand, it is vigorously implementing the method of charging and restricting official and military telegrams in order to crack down on them. On the other hand, it is strictly rectifying the method of assessing and examining the charging of official and military telegrams in order to show punishment and encouragement. On the other hand, it is investigating and deducting private official telegrams and recovering telegram fees. In recent years, it has achieved some success. The forced telegrams mentioned in the previous section are not common, and those who engage in private corruption do not dare to test the law. In the future, the political situation will gradually get on track and military affairs will also be calmed down. Perhaps the receipt of official telegrams in cash can achieve a satisfactory purpose?</p>
<h3 id="e284">China-Japan Wireless Telegraph Communication Will Begin Directly Today! <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— Qinghua</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Shanghai International Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications in January of the 18th year, it has made extraordinary efforts to develop international radio telegraph business. Therefore, there are now 11 communication circuits including Shanghai-Hong Kong, China-Philippines, China-Netherlands, China-United States (one for the Transportation Company and one for the Mackay Company), China-Germany, China-France, China-Switzerland, China-Vietnam, China-Russia, and China-UK. Among the countries in the world, almost all those with important business relations with China can be reached directly, which not only benefits the commercial people but also greatly assists China's operating enterprises economically. However, what we still regret is that Japan has not yet opened a direct wireless circuit with China, which is a fly in the ointment. The telegrams between Japan and China account for four to five million words each year, accounting for the first position in China's international telegrams. Now, almost all of these telegrams are transmitted by submarine cable. The Ministry of Communications, seeing this, has decided to open the China-Japan wireless circuit starting today. From now on, the telegrams between China and Japan can also be transmitted by radio. China's international radio telegraph business will have a long-term development!</p>
<p>China's domestic telegram business income has gradually declined in recent years due to the depression of industry and commerce, the disturbances of the Communist bandits, and the influence of provincial long-distance telephone. Each telegraph bureau is almost in a difficult situation to maintain. Fortunately, the international radio telegram business has been very good in the past two years, so it has been able to make up for the deficit. Starting from January this year, in order to reduce the burden on the people and develop the business, the Ministry of Communications has specially reduced the price of Chinese telegrams by charging for the name and address. After the implementation of this measure, it is estimated that the income will have to be reduced by 400,000 to 500,000 yuan per year. At this time of economic exhaustion of the telecommunications administration, it must be quickly sought to compensate for it. As for the method of compensation, since there is no possibility for development in the domestic telegrams, the only way is to actively develop international radio telegrams to make up for the insufficiency of domestic telegram income. The urgency of opening the China-Japan circuit is also one of the important reasons!</p>
<p>The prices of telegrams between China and Japan vary from place to place. In order to make it easier for readers to understand, a table is specially listed as follows:</p>
<p>Location of Communication, Total Price per Word, China's Local Line Fee, Japan's Local Line Fee, Submarine Cable Fee, Remarks</p>
<p>Shanghai and Japan, 75 centimes, 20 centimes, 20 centimes, 35 centimes, Qingzuo submarine cable transfer is limited</p>
<p>Qingdao and Japan, 1 franc 25 centimes, 25 centimes, 50 centimes, Qingzuo submarine cable transfer is limited</p>
<p>Other places and Japan, 1 franc 25 centimes, 50 centimes, 25 centimes, 50 centimes,</p>
<p>The submarine cable fees listed in the above table, except for the Qingzuo submarine cable fees, which are equally divided between China and Japan, are entirely earned by the submarine cable company, which amounts to about 2 million yuan per year. The opening of the China-Japan wireless circuit will undoubtedly be of great benefit to the telecommunications economy.</p>
<h3 id="e285">Research on the Application of Shortwaves in Wireless Communication (2) <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Dachun</p>
<p>The longest radio waves, with a frequency of ten to one hundred kilocycles per second, are best suited for long-distance international radio telegraph communication, because they are accurate, reliable, and not much affected by the atmosphere. This long wave, with a frequency of fifty kilocycles per second, can be used to transmit radio telephone, such as the transatlantic radio telephone from London to New York, which is one of the examples.</p>
<p>The frequency is from two hundred to two thousand kilocycles per second. This kind of radio wave is actually suitable for short-distance communication and is more suitable for broadcasting. Radio waves around two hundred kilocycles per second have the same properties as long waves, and the accuracy of transmission is no different from that of long waves. Higher frequencies, such as around two thousand kilocycles per second, often experience multiple changes in the strength of the electromagnetic field on the receiving side during the day. Because of this characteristic, the effect is weaker.</p>
<p>Shortwaves are now increasingly valuable for long-distance communication. This frequency is roughly from three thousand to twenty-five thousand kilocycles per second, and higher frequencies are more suitable for use.</p>
<p>When electrical engineers study the propagation characteristics of radio waves, the distinction between "long waves" and "shortwaves" is roughly explained as follows: The electromagnetic waves of long waves are transmitted directly from the transmitting end to the receiving end. As for shortwaves, all electromagnetic waves generated by the transmitting end are reflected by the high-altitude electron layer (IoniasdLayer) and then broadcast to the receiving end.</p>
<p>From experience, radio telephone using shortwaves also has its drawbacks. The electromagnetic field on the receiving side often changes due to the difference between day and night, the difference between seasons in a year, and the different paths of light and dark in the transmission circuit, which affects the sensitivity. However, this change can be reduced to a minimum. An automatic volume controller (AutomaticVolumeControl) can be installed on the receiving side to adjust the amplifier according to the height of the sound waves of the received signal. In addition, there are better methods, using various different frequencies in the same circuit, and making effective adjustments at any time according to the changes in the environment.</p>
<p>The most valuable point of shortwave radio is that it has a direct effect. Its broadcast radio waves can select a certain direction and transmit on one side. As for long waves, the height of the antenna must be determined according to the applied wavelength. In order to make it direct on one side and achieve good results, even with heavy mechanical equipment and huge capital investment, it may be difficult to achieve satisfactory success. For example, the latest shortwave radio telephone uses a concave mirror with a small hole in the middle. The radio waves are concentrated on the hole due to the concavity of the mirror and transported to the electron layer in the sky, which is reflected to the remote receiver. If this theory is implemented using long waves, the circular surface of the concave mirror must be twice the wavelength, and its diameter must be at least several hundred meters. The width of the antenna network must be several times the wavelength, and its height will reach five thousand meters. This is not allowed by reality, so long waves cannot be used. In modern shortwave radios, the ratio of the length and wavelength of the antenna is ten times, and the height is two times. This ratio is absolutely no problem for radio waves below ten meters. For radio waves exceeding one hundred meters, it is absolutely difficult in practice. Therefore, shortwaves are comparatively valuable.</p>
<p>Modern radio transceivers using reflector and directive antennas have become a common fact. This method can increase the broadcast rate by 15 (Decibels) compared to the non-directional method, so it really increases the efficiency in radio communication.</p>
<h3 id="e286">How Can Telegrams Be Expedited? <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>The effectiveness of a telegram lies in its speed, so telegrams can also be called "speedy reports." If a telegram is slow, it not only loses its effectiveness but can also lead to important matters being delayed. Therefore, the sole responsibility of the telegraph office is to deliver telegrams as quickly as possible! But how to achieve the goal of speed in telegrams is a very important question!</p>
<p>The process of a telegram from the sender to the telegraph office, from the telegraph office sending it, to its delivery to the recipient, has been roughly described by Mr. Jiran in the previous issue. In short, the conditions required for the speed of telegrams are the following four: (1) simple processing procedures, (2) sensitive telegraph machines, (3) intact telegraph lines, and (4) diligent staff. If the telegraph office can achieve all four of these, then the mission of speed in telegrams can be easily achieved. Conversely, if the telegraph office has a problem in any one of these aspects, telegrams will be difficult to expedite!</p>
<p>So, let's take a look at how the current telegraph office is doing with regard to the four items mentioned above. First, the Ministry of Communications has recently referenced the telegraph handling procedures of various foreign telegraph offices and commercially operated submarine cable companies, and used scientific methods to regulate the handling procedures. Under the principle of stability and reliability, it strives for simplicity of procedures so that handling can be expedited. Second, a year ago, the Ministry of Communications purchased a large number of new-style Creed telegraph machines, telegraph typewriters, and keyboard perforators from the United Kingdom, which will soon be installed in telegraph offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, Beiping, Qingdao, Jinan, Yantai, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Guangdong, and other places. The advantage of this new-style Creed telegraph machine is that when the paper tape perforated in telegraph office A is sent to telegraph office B, telegraph office B also receives a perforated paper tape that is exactly the same. Telegraph office B then puts this paper tape on the machine and sends it to telegraph office C. If the old-style Western machine is used, then telegraph office B only receives a paper tape with symbols printed in ink. If it needs to be transferred to telegraph office C, only manual perforation can be used to punch the paper tape before sending it to telegraph office C. The new-style Creed machine can eliminate manual perforation, which can speed up the process by several times for long-distance telegrams that must be transferred through several telegraph offices. As for the telegraph typewriter, it is similar to an ordinary typewriter. This machine can be installed in telegraph offices with two direct telegraph lines. When telegraph office A types, telegraph office B immediately prints out the typed words, and its speed is the same as that of an ordinary typewriter. The keyboard perforator is also similar to a typewriter, but when the letter key is pressed, it can punch symbols on a kind of oiled paper tape, which is several times faster than manual perforation, which requires punching each dot and stroke. After these three types of machines are installed and used, the speed of telegrams will surely give the people of the country a new look! Third, the Ministry of Communications has been working hard to reorganize the telegraph lines in the past two years. Now, unless there is a strong wind or bandit disaster, there are few cases of interruption, so telegraph services are not delayed at all. Fourth, the Ministry of Communications has recently been sending personnel to inspect the diligence and laziness of telegraph office staff. Those who are found to be lazy or delaying telegrams are severely punished. Therefore, the spirit of doing things has been greatly invigorated recently. In particular, the people who receive telegrams have been repeatedly ordered to be humble in their attitude, so that the senders feel satisfied. At the same time, the telegraph office has also specially set up business inspectors to ask various merchants and telegram senders if there are any unsatisfactory points, so as to find out and improve them at any time. All four of the above-mentioned points have been put in a great deal of effort by the telegraph office in order to expedite telegrams. Now let me talk about how the senders and recipients of telegrams should help the telegraph office to achieve the mission of speed in telegrams!</p>
<p>If people who send Chinese telegrams translate the telegram into telegraph code themselves using the "New Compilation of Telegraph Codes," they will not only save translation fees, but also allow the telegram to be sent immediately when it is delivered to the telegraph office, saving the time of the telegraph office's translator to translate it into telegraph code. This is because the telegraph office's translators have at most two or three people per shift. If they receive more than a dozen Chinese telegrams at the same time, each person must translate three or four telegrams. In fact, the last telegram to be translated will inevitably be slightly delayed. This is the reason why the authorities have not abolished the translation fee to this day!</p>
<p>There are two things that recipients of telegrams can do to help the telegraph office to expedite telegram delivery: (1) When receiving a telegram, be sure to sign the receipt slip with the time of receipt. This will allow the person in charge of the telegraph office to know when the telegram was properly delivered. If there is an unjustified delay, the messenger can be punished as a warning to others. This will make the messengers not dare to delay the delivery of telegrams, and the telegram can be delivered to the recipient's hand quickly. (2) Recipients should preferably not detain the messenger, because each messenger usually carries two or three telegrams at a time when going out to deliver telegrams. If each recipient delays the messenger for several minutes, then the last telegram to be delivered will be delayed by ten or twenty minutes! At the same time, if a messenger is delayed outside for too long, he will be late returning to the office, so the remaining telegrams in the telegraph office will also be affected, because if he returns to the office one moment earlier, he can then deliver the remaining telegrams in turn! Although there are many messengers in the telegraph office, and there are several in each shift, all telegrams do not necessarily have to wait for a certain messenger to return to the office before they can be delivered. However, when the telegraph service is very busy, the faster the messenger returns to the office, the faster the delivery speed will be. This is an obvious fact. Speaking of the reasons why recipients detain messengers, there are roughly two reasons: First, the recipient is busy with other things and has no time to receive the telegram and sign. (Westerners often only sign, not stamp with a round seal.) Second, the recipient delays time because they are looking for a seal. Regarding these two points, (1) it is hoped that the recipient will sign for the telegram immediately when they receive it. (2) The personal seal should be kept on the body or in a certain place, so as to avoid wasting time looking for it temporarily. This will greatly benefit the telegraph office!</p>
<h3 id="e287">Recent Situation of Long-Distance Telephone in Europe and America <a href="#e287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Qikun</p>
<p>I. Introduction</p>
<p>The connection of telephone networks and wireless telephone networks to form a world telephone network has been successfully realized. Countries are becoming increasingly concerned about the enrichment of their domestic telephone networks. Once technical problems are resolved through research, the trend is to focus on the establishment and completion of long-distance telephone circuit networks. Among these, Germany is particularly prominent, as the automation of its urban telephone system is nearing completion. It is now advancing toward the automation of long-distance telephones, which has become widespread. Many other small European countries have followed this example. In the United States, the American Telegraph and Telephone Company held a conference on long-distance telephone cable networks and accompanying plans in 1929, and the decisions made at the conference have been implemented sequentially. In the United States, telephone services in various states were originally handled by companies with different names under the same system. Now, this telephone network, especially long-distance telephone services, is directly managed by the American Telegraph and Telephone Company, so that the country can be unified and the design and maintenance can be gradually advanced according to plan.</p>
<p>II. Long-Distance Telephone in Germany</p>
<p>German telephone charges are based on distance, with a five-kilometer unit used as a charging zone. Calls within five kilometers (except for cities with more than 100,000 users, which can be extended to eight, ten, or fifteen kilometers depending on the number of users) are called ordinary urban calls, while those beyond this are called long-distance calls, which are further divided into short-distance calls (within 75 kilometers), medium-distance calls (within 300 kilometers), and long-distance calls (over 300 kilometers). Germany's investment in telephone equipment is shown in the table below, and its abundance of long-distance telephone cables and its sufficiency of long-distance telephone bureaus are highly noteworthy.</p>
<p>Land and property, Equipment inside the bureau, Underground cables, Overhead lines, Other, Total, Urban telephone, Million Marks, 194.1, 405.9, 557.5, 188.6, 62.7, 1409.8, Percentage, 13.8, 28.8, 39.6, 13.4, 4.4, 100.0, Long-distance telephone, Million Marks, 100.0, 60.9, 514.7, 110.5, 33.7, 819.8, Percentage, 16.7, 9.8, 50.3, 17.8, 5.4, 100.0</p>
<p>Long-distance telephones have the following three characteristics: (1) the call fee is calculated according to time and distance, (2) registration and waiting are required before the call, and (3) when a long-distance telephone is connected, if the user is making a local call, it is forcibly terminated. However, due to the gradual adoption of immediate dialing, the only difference between it and the urban telephone is the first item. The so-called immediate dialing means that, for example, when making a call from Nanjing to Zhenjiang, because there are many lines between Nanjing and Zhenjiang, the user can immediately connect from the Nanjing long-distance station to the Zhenjiang telephone bureau, or even directly transfer to the Zhenjiang bureau using the dialer on the telephone (such as Nanjing to Pukou) without going through the Nanjing long-distance station. Only after the Zhenjiang long-distance station makes an inquiry, it will connect to the user you want to reach. If the Zhenjiang telephone bureau is also automatic, the Nanjing user can completely directly call the Zhenjiang user.</p>
<p>Since the automation of urban telephones in Germany is nearing completion, its national long-distance telephone circuit network has also been completed, and the long-distance telephone bureaus have been merged and concentrated. Thus, a concentrated small long-distance bureau (E.F.) is used as a cell nucleus, and 55 suitable cities are selected nationwide as the first relay bureau (V.F.), and 15 places are the second relay bureau (D.F.). The domestic call area is also limited, and its lines can be connected to any place. The speech volume (Transmission Equivalent) of lines and bureau internal equipment is as follows:</p>
<p>Urban Telephone User to the bureau is 0.45N (that is, Noper), within the bureau is 0.15N, inter-bureau is 1N, totaling 2.2N.</p>
<p>Long-distance telephone (1) Urban part, user to urban bureau is 0.45N, urban bureau is 0.15N, urban bureau to long-distance bureau is 0.3N, long-distance bureau is 0.1N, totaling 1N, (2) Long-distance part, long-distance bureau and long-distance bureau is 1.3N, totaling 3.3N.</p>
<p>Immediate long-distance call, user to urban bureau is 0.45N, urban bureau is 0.15N, urban bureau to immediate bureau is 0.3N, immediate bureau is 0.25N, immediate bureau to immediate bureau is 1N, totaling 3.1N.</p>
<p>(A) Concentrated Small Long-Distance Bureau (E.F.)</p>
<p>Long-distance bureaus within a radius of about 35 kilometers are concentrated in the E.F. bureau at its center point. The exchange with the bureaus in this area is generally done in an immediate style. Calls between other bureaus in the area do not go through the operator and are fully automatic. Therefore, this inter-bureau connection line is not called a long-distance line. Immediate-style 50-week long-distance selection is used between adjacent E.F. bureaus.</p>
<p>(B) First Relay Bureau (V.F.)</p>
<p>Within the range where an intermediate repeater is not installed, this becomes the central bureau of the E.F. bureau, and an intermediate repeater is occasionally set up in special circumstances. Therefore, its coverage area is a radius of about 140 kilometers.</p>
<p>(C) Second Relay Bureau (D.F.)</p>
<p>This is equipped with the scale of a large long-distance bureau. All return lines from V.F. are concentrated here, and direct return lines are set up between each D.F. bureau. Due to geographical reasons, there are also international telephone bureaus set up here. Since it is connected to the cable network and is engaged in relaying overseas telephone calls, it is called the World Relay Bureau (V.F.), which is located in Berlin.</p>
<p>III. Long-Distance Telephone in the United Kingdom</p>
<p>Long-distance telephones in the United Kingdom are divided into 18 zones, which are further divided into 170 groups, each with a central bureau. This division is based on operational convenience and is not related to the charging area. Since 1930, Demand stations have been set up in the zone center bureaus to implement immediate dialing. There are direct lines between these bureaus. There are also direct lines from the group center bureaus to their affiliated zone center bureaus. The standard of voice volume such as inserting a middle repeater and the line is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>1. Between two users belonging to the same bureau, 2.2N.</p>
<p>2. Between users belonging to the same area, or different areas (within 340 kilometers), or two cities with direct lines, 2.7N</p>
<p>3. Between users in adjacent areas (more than 340 kilometers), places below 480 kilometers, or between users in two cities without direct lines and below 480 to 640 kilometers, 3.3N</p>
<p>4. Other long-distance long-distance telephone return lines, 3.9N</p>
<p>IV. Long-Distance Telephone in the United States</p>
<p>The United States, like Germany, also uses 2,500 bureaus as a central bureau, called Toll Center (T.C.), and its first relay bureau is called Primary outlet (P.O.), with 150 locations. These are also connected to eight Regional centers (R.C.) with direct lines, all of which use the immediate dialing of the C.L.R. method. Its voice volume is as follows:</p>
<p>T.C. P.O. 3. cdb T.C. T.C. 6. odb T.C. R. 3. 5db P.O. R. 3. 5db R.C. R.C. 4. 0db P.O. P.O. 4. 0db Direct line (for terminal bureau) 9.0db Terminal bureau loss 7.0db</p>
<p>The maximum loss when passing through two relay bureaus is 25 db (that is, decibeld b). The maximum voice volume between the United States and Canada is 31...</p>
<p>The structure of the long-distance telephone networks of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Germany is listed in the left for comparison:</p>
<p>Number of small long-distance bureaus, Number of first relay bureaus, Number of second relay bureaus, Number of world telephone bureaus, United Kingdom, Group Center 170, Zone center 18, 1, United States, Toll center 2500, Primary ooutlet 150, Regional acentr 8, Germany Bureau, E.F. 650, V.F. 55, D.F. 15, W.I.F</p>

<p>— Society Member</p>
<p>(Revised Three Types of Telegram Regulations) The Ministry of Communications believes that various telegram regulations have been promulgated for quite some time, and many of the articles are no longer suitable for use. Therefore, it has recently been revising various regulations one after another in order to be applicable. The three types of regulations that have now been revised and promulgated are the Zhenwu Telegram Regulations, the News Telegram Regulations, and the Postal Transfer Telegram Regulations. The content of the Zhenwu Telegram Regulations is roughly the same as the old Zhangwu Telegram Free Regulations, but the articles have been slightly reorganized. A new type of mid-way copy method has been added to the News Telegram Regulations. All news telegrams may be requested by the sender to be copied by the telegraph office that relays the telegram in the middle to the local news agencies (the telegraph office that does not relay the telegram in the middle cannot copy it. For example, Shanghai to Nanjing is a direct telegram, and Suzhou cannot copy it.) However, the words "Send to a certain news agency at a certain place" should be added in the recipient's name and address column. The charge for this copy telegram is one cent per Chinese character and two cents per English or Japanese character. The most important point of the revision of the Postal Transfer Telegram Regulations is the exemption of postage. The articles are simplified to make it easier for the public to understand. These new regulations can be obtained from various telegraph offices, radio stations, and this newspaper.</p>
<p>(Opening of the Sino-Japanese Wireless Circuit) The Sino-Japanese wireless circuit was officially opened on June 1. Shanghai has begun to receive and send foreign language, Chinese, and Japanese telegrams at the same time. The inland area is limited to receiving and sending foreign language telegrams. The communication radio stations are the Shanghai International Radio Station and the Tokyo Radio Station, both of which use high-speed automatic receiving and sending machines to work. Because the Tokyo Telegraph Bureau of Japan is the center of the Japanese telegraph lines, the telegrams are faster than those that must be relayed through Nagasaki by submarine cable. The charging methods for Chinese and Japanese telegrams are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Name and address: The place name of the recipient and the recipient's name and address, regardless of how many characters, are all counted as one character. However, if a copy telegram adds one recipient's name and address, one character should be added.</p>
<p>(2) Telegram text: Chinese telegrams can be written with numbers connected together. For example, the two characters "Zhonghua" can be written as "00225478." Every seven numbers are counted as one character, which is more than twice or three times cheaper than the original charging method for foreign language telegrams (that is, four codes are counted as one character, and the recipient's name and address are charged by character). Japanese telegrams must be written in Japanese kana, and every seven kana are counted as one character. Detailed methods can be inquired at the Renji Road International Radio Station.</p>
<h3 id="e289">Q&amp;A Column <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— Reporter</p>
<p>(Mr. Li Yanzong asks) (1) Our place is 50 miles away from the city. Telegrams are delivered by letter carriers, and the public feels very difficult because they have to pay special labor fees. Can they all be delivered by postmen without taking additional fees?</p>
<p>(3) According to the new regulations, if the recipient's name and address do not exceed 15 characters, they are all charged according to five characters. How is it calculated if this number of characters is exceeded? Also, telegrams are not available in our county. Can we ask the post office to collect and forward telegrams on our behalf?</p>
<p>(Answer) (1) It is noted that telegrams marked for special delivery are sent immediately with one telegram and one messenger, so a special labor fee is charged. It is not convenient to have them all delivered by postmen to avoid delays. However, the collection of special labor fees has a certain set of regulations. Please read item (D) of the "Summary of New Regulations for Saving Telegram Fees" given by this newspaper to find out.</p>
<p>(2) Please read item (B) of the "Summary of New Regulations for Saving Telegram Fees" given by this newspaper to find out the method of calculating the fees for Chinese telegrams with the recipient's name and address exceeding 15 characters. If your county does not have a telegraph office, you can ask the post office to collect it on your behalf. This type of telegram is called a postal telegram transfer. At the post office, it is sent as an express letter, so it is also extremely fast. And from March 1, 1934, all fees are charged according to the prices set by the telegraph office, and no additional postage is charged.</p>
<p>(A gentleman from Wuxi asks) Can the following telegram be used as a clear telegram: (Jiangmi rose 122)? The telegraph office's receiver believed that the word "tube" in the telegram did not make sense and changed it to the two characters "per bag." Is this legal? Please show me.</p>
<p>(Answer) This telegram can be used as a clear code telegram. However, if the telegraph office's receiver has any doubts about the meaning of the telegram, the sender should explain it in detail to avoid misunderstandings. It is certainly illegal to change the telegram on behalf of the sender, and you can refuse the change.</p>
<h3 id="e290">Voices from the Telegraph Industry: Shanghai-Yantai-Gulin Submarine Cable <a href="#e290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>Acting on behalf of returning to self-management</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Yantai-Gulin submarine cable has been managed by the Great Eastern and Great Northern Companies on behalf of the Chinese government starting from the 20th of this month, and has been returned to self-management *.</p>
<p>From then on, the convenience of telecommunications in the north of China will be further improved.</p>
<p>The areas through which the above-mentioned submarine cable passes are all within our country's territory and territorial waters. Independent communication is the only inviolable principle for independent countries in the world *.</p>
<p>However, in our country, there is the name of acting on behalf of the Chinese government. What does acting on behalf of the Chinese government mean? Is it not *</p>
<p>nominal but not real, and the power does not belong to us?</p>
<p>According to investigations, the Shanghai-Yantai-Gulin submarine cable was opportunistically laid by the Great Eastern and Great Northern Companies during the Boxer Rebellion because our country's Tianjin-Shanghai land line was sometimes blocked. After the matter was settled, the Qing court negotiated and established a treaty to repay the shallow capital in installments. The time *</p>
<p>was in the 26th year of Guangxu. According to the provisions of the treaty, it should have been recovered after the Western calendar year 1925 (that is, the 14th year of the Republic of China): Only because the situation was unstable in the past, it was indulged in and repeatedly delayed, which is inevitable *</p>
<p>is a pity.</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Yantai-Gulin submarine cable is extremely convenient for transmitting telegrams in northern China. Before it was recovered, it was parallel to our country's Tianjin-Shanghai direct land line and Shanghai-Yantai submarine cable, forming a confrontation: But in recent years, the Ministry of Communications has actively reorganized the Tianjin-Shanghai land line ( *</p>
<p>There is a section of submarine cable that is the Yangtze River) and the Shanghai-Yantai submarine cable is also well managed, and there are absolutely few drawbacks *</p>
<p>The profits were thick in the past, but they are thin today. Things are done by people, and it cannot be generalized.</p>
<p>Now that the Ministry of Communications has recovered the submarine cable for self-management, in the future, regarding the sending of telegrams to northern China, it can be done by land line. *</p>
<p>, and it is also possible by submarine cable. Originally, there was only one route, but now there are two routes for delivery, the efficiency is increased, and the speed is doubled. *</p>
<p>This is indeed the fact that can be shown after the submarine cable is recovered. As for the autonomy of communication rights, it is even more important, which is indeed worth *</p>
<p>to be pleased with.</p>

<h3 id="e291">El Salvador Recognizes the Puppet State <a href="#e291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>Given the Japanese's calculated, cunning schemes and international collusion, valuing profit over righteousness, we knew early on that those who would follow Japan in recognizing the puppet state would be numerous. Not long ago, there were rumors that Germany would recognize it, and legends that the United States would. Although neither country's recognition materialized, before we knew it, El Salvador, a small country in Central America, boldly and shamelessly violated international trust, infringed upon the League of Nations covenant, undermined the common front of various countries against Manchuria, and openly announced its recognition. According to reports: (The Republic of El Salvador, on the 19th of this month, notified Japan through its Consul General in Tokyo, and the representative of the Japanese puppet Manchuria, that the country officially recognized Manchuria from March 3rd of this year.)</p>
<p>According to the League of Nations resolution of March 11, 1932, non-recognition (of Manchuria) had long been on file. El Salvador, as a member of the League of Nations, though not voting at the time nor declaring abstention, was legally obligated to abide by that resolution. Now, disregarding everything, abandoning this mandatory obligation, and being the first to break the covenant and grant recognition, has a very serious impact on the fundamental issues of the League of Nations itself. According to the speculation of observers of the international situation in Washington: (El Salvador's recognition of (Manchuria) is nothing more than an attempt to make things difficult for the United States. Because El Salvador's interests in the Far East are insignificant, this action has no important significance other than making the United States' strategies towards neighboring countries slightly more thorny.) If this is true, we believe international behavior is far too frivolous. To vent personal resentment, any means are employed, even to the point of destroying the League of Nations covenant and leaving behind endless troubles, which is nothing less than being a thief of international morality. If the League of Nations does not severely punish and expel this irresponsible and despicable traitor in the future, then the League's remaining prestige will be completely lost.</p>
<p>However, in our opinion, although it is still difficult to understand the intention behind El Salvador's recognition of the puppet state, it may contain some element of embarrassment for the United States, as some Americans have suggested, but it can be asserted that it must have been secretly lured and manipulated by the Japanese. The Japanese have been visibly exhausted in their international attempts to have the puppet state of Manchukuo recognized. Up to now, although many major countries in the world have wanted to recognize it due to their interests, they have ultimately been hesitant to try it rashly due to some concerns. Therefore, in disappointment, the Japanese turned to winning over small countries like El Salvador, not hesitating to feign courteousness to induce them to recognize it. Because El Salvador is also a member of the League of Nations, its recognition, though not visibly enhancing the international status of the puppet Manchukuo, will certainly shake the League's anti-Manchuria front, which is enough to fulfill its long-cherished wish.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of recognizing the puppet state, the future is not optimistic. According to the observation of the Paris Economic and Financial News Agency, (although the United States has used various roundabout means to isolate Japan, Japan is now taking the opportunity to strike back at the United States, and other Latin American countries may follow El Salvador's example.) We confirm this with the attitude previously taken by the United Kingdom, and we also know that those who will follow and recognize the puppet Manchukuo will surely follow one after another. The United Kingdom is the strongest supporter of the League of Nations, and it goes without saying that it should strictly abide by the League of Nations' resolution not to recognize the puppet state. However, when the United States and Japan advocated understanding in the past, London had a tendency to approve of the United States' recognition of the puppet Manchukuo, saying that (the United States' recognition of Manchuria is actually welcomed by the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom believes that the existence of Manchukuo is still far off, and Japan's hegemony in Manchuria is still difficult to shake for the time being. The United Kingdom is very close to the League of Nations, so the United Kingdom does not want the League of Nations to take a stand on Manchukuo, and it is the first to recognize it. However, the United Kingdom is willing for the United States to take steps to recognize Manchukuo, as a step for it to follow in the future.)</p>
<p>The puppet Manchukuo, created by the Japanese, has long been envied by the world. However, why have the countries decided not to recognize it in the past, and repeatedly wanted to recognize it later? This is exactly as the news agency said: (Whether Manchuria becomes a province of China or is protected by Japan, its future development is unlimited, which is known to everyone. Therefore, it is undoubtedly inevitable that countries will drool over it in the future. The reason why a small Central American country, which is now engaged in a diplomatic war with Washington, can overthrow the anti-Japanese resolution solemnly passed by the League of Nations is for this reason.) In other words, it is for the sake of profit. That is why we say that the future of the issue of recognizing the puppet state is not optimistic.</p>
<p>Regarding El Salvador's recognition of the puppet state, the plan for the future lies not in how the League of Nations will impose sanctions, or how the United States and Japan will re-emerge into conflict, but in how our country will be inspired and invigorated.</p>

<p>— Tian Hua</p>
<p>If spring is likened to a young girl, then summer should be a heavily made-up young woman. The bleak and solemn autumn easily makes us think of a late-blooming middle-aged woman, and the biting cold winter will awaken us to the loneliness of an old woman. Not only women, but most people's lives can be compared in this way. Although some people use a sound spirit as the standard, when talking about an elderly person, if he is progressive and combative, he can be an ("old youth"); a youth, if he lacks this passion and vitality, he is inevitably a ("remnant of the past"), who is mostly old. However, the passion of youth and the passion of old age are somewhat different after all, and youth after all has greater vitality. This is just like the seasons of spring and summer, which are likened to youth, and their contribution to mankind is greater after all, and cannot be compared with autumn and winter. The fallen leaves of autumn make us feel adrift, and the wind and snow of winter make us feel desolate. Only spring and summer, especially the late spring and early summer, give us the greatest vitality and creativity. During this period, we look at things with joyful eyes and work with an active and vigorous heart. At this time, our interest is particularly good, and our work efficiency is also particularly high! These are all bestowed upon us by the climate.</p>
<p>It is not difficult for us to find many examples. Many inventions and creations in the world have manifested their existence during these spring and summer seasons. May and June are particularly suitable for invention and creation. Columbus was convinced of the theory of a round earth and wanted to discover a route to India from the west, so he discovered the New World! But it was in May and June that he had this intention to sail. Galileo invented the telescope, and later used the telescope to observe the spots on the moon, saying that the moon has bumps and hollows like the earth, and is definitely not completely round! These inventions or discoveries were obtained through hard work in the months of April, May, and June. Goethe's Faust was written in March and April. Many of Dante's poems were also mostly written in the spring and summer seasons. Someone, based on the months and years of many masterpieces in the world, said that May is the most suitable month for creation in the four seasons of the year, followed by April, June, March (March and June are the same), September, July, and August. The months that are not suitable for creation are November, January, October, December, and February! Among them, February is the worst and cannot be created. From the above facts, we know that we are now in the most active month of May, in this ("eventful") month of May. In fact, the reason why May is ("eventful") is precisely to give us a powerful proof that May is the most active and vibrant month for people. Workers all over the world show their vitality on the very first day of May. May 3rd, May 4th, May 9th, and May 30th each represent the most active link of people in this month. I dare say that in the future, major changes in the world, such as major revolutions, major wars, and major... will have more opportunities to occur in May and its neighboring months. The influence of the season on people is undeniable.</p>
<p>In fact, this is almost self-evident. In the spring and summer seasons, birds sing particularly well, and their feathers are also more beautiful. During this period, animals are particularly majestic and spectacular. At this time, human faces also show particularly vivid and lively smiles, and their hearts are filled with vitality and spring feelings! Everything shows the greatness of the season's bestowal.</p>
<p>We must not fail such a good season, let us all unleash our potential vitality and creativity!</p>
