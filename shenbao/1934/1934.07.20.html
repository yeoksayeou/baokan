<p>延</p>
<p>數月來暫保小康之察東局面。最近又有驟趨緊張之勢。如日方承德會議議决增兵長城國防綫。士肥原氏遊說西蒙各王公。薛盟烏珠穆沁部贈良馬於僞滿。宋哲元氏致急電於中央。種種消息。皆足爲昭著之左證。</p>
<p>日人爲便利侵略起見。旣劃東三省爲南滿與北滿。復分内蒙僞東蒙與西蒙。所謂東蒙者。係指熱河及遼寗之一部。九一八後。日人以强力置諸僞滿之之</p>
<p>版圖。而控制其實權。今日之西蒙。不過含有察綏兩省之錫烏伊三盟。亦竟由日人慫慂當地少數王公假借高度自治之美名。而形成實際之分立。夫日人垂涎於滿蒙者。數十年如一日。得滿以後。取蒙史易。今東蒙旣爲　括以去。大好西蒙。豈肯舍而不取。惟日人　爲計。計苟能以威迫利誘之手段而償共所夙願。則亦雅不欲勞師喪財。以消耗其對俄作戰之元氣耳。大槪日人今後之計劃。第一步在使西蒙與僞滿相提携。第二步由僞滿之力量。促進東西蒙之合併。以組織田中奏摺中所稱之「蒙古大源共和國』。第三步訂結類似「滿蒙議定書」之條約。夷「大源共和國』爲僞滿之附庸。其關係或卽如今日僞滿之與日本。最終乃由溥儀等傀儡抄襲日韓合併故事。「獻贈」「滿洲國」於日皇。而全部蒙古之主權。因亦隨之而東渡。</p>
<p>日人步驟旣定。而猶在審愼考慮。不欲操之太急者實非恐懼我國之反抗或西蒙之掙扎。而僅爲對俄作戰策萬全耳。蓋一旦日人西侵察綏。直趨外蒙。則貝加爾湖以東之西比利亞土地。可以盡歸日人之手故俄人對於日軍在察東一帶之行動。異常注意。蘇聨軍事委員會長莫洛特夫曾密派高級參謀及專家多人赴内蒙各盟實地視察。以謀對付卽可見其重視之一斑。預料日本侵略西蒙得手。日俄戰機必將更爲成熟若再進一步進佔外蒙。則戰禍</p>
<h3 id="c33">之爆發。幾可立而待矣。 <a href="#c33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>世人雖有根據軍事交通之理由。斷定日本參謀部必不至假道外蒙以攻擊蘇聨者。然日人旣在沿長城及察東一帶積極建築左砲台堡壘無綫電台飛機塲鐵路公路等軍事設備。自不能謂爲毫無用意。據吾人觀察。日人對俄作戰計劃。雖不限於一隅而察東方面實不失爲其注意焦點之一。以常情推測。日人在此方面之軍事行動殆將採取一剪刀之形式。換言之。卽以多倫爲中心。而分展兵力於南北。一路向西北循多倫庫倫進展。希圖囊括錫盟。而佔有西蒙之全部。然後經錫盟之蘇治滂江等地。直迫外蒙車臣汗部交通樞紐之鳥得。日軍至此。便可切斷中俄交通。而威脅西比利亞。其他一路沿沾源二四兩區。向南發展席捲黃河以北。</p>
<p>日人之目的在此。雖不中要亦不遠。最近消息。謂察東難關便　在今秋。當非過慮。惟中央之應付方針。除派遺劉守中氏前往視察外。猶無所聞。竊謂察宋綏傅晋徐諸將。皆爲今日軍人中之富有國家思想者。中央丁此危局。必當有以成全其捍衛國土之志。卽蒙古自治政務委員會中。亦不乏明白大體公忠愛國之士今該會旣有要求中央恊助軍備以充防務之議。中央爲貫澈扶植内蒙自治之初衷計。自亦不可不勉如其請也。</p>

<p>正經濟破產假面具全部揭開國軍攺變政策爲其致命傷＝</p>
<p>南昌通訊、軍息、自首女匪諶輝、陳述共匪的瘼症、頗爲詳盡、茲誌如下、</p>
<p>一、自殺政策共匪根據列寗的理論、模仿蘇俄的策略、不按事實、拿到中國來硬幹而蠻幹的執行、並想用機器化的工作方式、很快的完成他的任務、對外還是用發展民族革命戰爭爲號召的口號、在匪區内面、正在進行勞工專政、所謂資產階級、及多數小資產階級出身的、在匪區内裹面、不容許有生存的餘地，如過去在一匪黨内面歷史很長的、並負責過重要責任的積極份了、都皆受打擊很重、或藉口工作上理論上、犯了某一傾向的錯誤、則絲毫不客氣的殺、按照他的分析、除了極少數的僱農爲無產階級、其大多數的自耕農、亦目之爲小資產階級、工人工資高一點的、又說是資本家的走狗和貴族工人、那麽、照中國這種普遍的小農經濟組織工業、未曾萌芽的社會、倘然是要在共匪的政策之下行去、只有將中國四萬萬同胞、都皆殺盡而已、這種不顧人道的政策、已經在中國的經濟組織上、决定了他會自然歸於滅亡的、</p>
<p>二、勞動法的矛盾匪區一般的工人、都要在他勞働法令之下、可是匪區裹面那種勞働法、完全係苛待雇主的一種法令、如每一個老閶、有了八十元之資本的時候、就要由蘇維埃介紹一個工人、替他做工、雙方訂立合同、如果是一個童工、每月須要十元至十二元的工資、並要時常參加蘇維埃會議工作、工資仍照給、在一個月之内、不得替老閶做上半月工、因之老閶只好關門、工人只好失業、故匪區的牧童工人、都是在他們勞働法影響下、以致失業、另方面匪區的實業、不能發展、這都是他們不按事實而行事所發生的予盾、</p>
<p>三、經濟破產共匪自經國軍一·二·三·四·五·各次圍剿、雖然沒有完全消滅、可</p>
<p>是匪區的範圍、日益縮小、加以封鎖政策、戰爭激烈、匪區壯丁、均被徵爲匪軍、生產力驟减、而經濟物質問題、已發生莫大恐慌、照僞中央統計、各個匪區的開支表、每月至少須在百萬上下、湘鄂贛匪區、每人每月兩元的伙食、尙不能發給、沒有辦法、加緊游擊、捉土豪、在游擊區内土豪、連皮都剥光了、就只有壓迫羣衆、銷售公債劵、公債劵已經四期、羣衆在幾次得到一張不兌現的紙、已不肯再上當了、因之匪區經濟危機一天一天加深、四、欺騙的假面具揭破共匪向來欺騙羣衆技倆、以政權與土地問題、想藉此攖取羣衆爲他爭勢力範圍、而送死的一種方法、可是事實上、因在他們整個經濟問題、不能解决之下、對羣衆那種無名的剥削、不堪指數、甚麽累進稅、互濟會費募捐、每個羣衆、又要替匪軍儲藏一籮榖一斤油、半斤鹽、每一個婦女、要替匪軍做鞋子、打草馬、送菓子、捐送棉衣、又要替匪軍耕種公田與匪軍家屬的田、甚麽放哨·抽丁·開會·担架隊·運輸隊等等差事、相逼而來、倘一抵抗、則以反革命論罪、並得羣衆飢寒交迫、呌苦連天、生活痛苦、不堪形容、其一二因此在五次圍剿、七分政治影響之下、有極多數羣衆、回頭到靑天白日旗幟之下、來找出路、五、派别分歧共匪内部、因政治主張不統一與階級鬥爭、過於尖銳、發生極多的派别組織、如改組派·ＡＢ圑·戀愛研究社·第三黨·取消派左傾·右傾·機會主義立三路綫·羅明路綫·等名稱、這些份子、互相火併、是他有形的崩潰的象徵、</p>
<p>六、思想動搖稍有思索的份了、在政治上動搖、因見共黨在進行中的策略、不能適應於現中國鬥爭過於激烈、而發生思想上的動搖、由動搖而產生派别、由派别而發生鬥爭、鬥爭的結果、互敗俱傷、或被殺、或被押、或逃跑、思想簡單的份子、純粹因其生活太苦、與紀律太嚴而動搖、只想拖槍投誠、而得金錢歸家、</p>

<p>六月三日、發石拐子、五里砂河井、因昨趕站、馬乏不行、另雇一匹、送到蘭州、給價四元、此處土地、因養地力、須隔年一種、甚有隔二三年者、否利徒勞無益、二十里甘露池、與老農考究壓砂種地·可當肥料之理、略爲（一）石有潤濕之氣、原可滋生作物、（二）雨後可含蓄水分、歷久不乾、（三）暴風雨時、可鎭壓作物之根部、（四）土質堅燥、肥料缺乏、非舖砂石、難望收成、惟舖砂工程浩繁、每畝地面、舖厚三四寸、須費六十金以上、且新舖效微、年久力隴西用驢挽汲井泉</p>
<p>衰、興旺時期、不過二三十年、至多五六十年、卽須棄舊換新、故有「苦死老了、吃死兒子、餓死孫子、」之諺、他省耕種、遇有砂石、務須檢去、此則反是、雖曰地宜、終非善法、且云「砂有多厚、卽耕多厚、」藉非砂地、亦僅淺耕二三寸、顯與深耕、之法、大相逕庭、隴省田地、大半廣種少收、不知深耕、要爲一大原因、蓋不僅水澤缺乏已也、</p>
<p>村中人口、原茂繁　密十八年旱災、活活餓死者、幾逹半數、今田地荒蕪、年甚一年、一面固由於人口之稀少、他面則由於耕種資本之缺乏、十八年以前、普通利貸、雖已高逹五分至十分、痛感剥削、然尙有可借之處、乃自十八年以後、全民一貧如洗、果稍有貯蓄者、爲避免窮困之覬觎、差事之多攤、亦無不裝出種種窮相塞人吿借之門、農人爲欲購種子、及其他救急用、縱壓契抵產、高出利貸數倍、終亦無敢應命者、因而坐失農時、逼死人命、所在多有、欲使興復、信用合作社尙矣、</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3 id="c224">關於「文學槪論」（續） <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>答周筠君</p>
<p>周君向我們提出的疑問，我們可以分成三部分來回答：第一，文學槪論應該給予讀者一些什麽？第二，潘著的文學槪論究竟好不好？第三，那一本文學槪論比較可讀？</p>
<p>文學槪論，如字面所昭示，是反文學領域的各個問題加以槪括的叙述、使初學文學者對於文學容易得到一個簡單明確的槪念，從而知道怎樣去研究文學。這不是編述，也不成其爲專著，因爲編述，只是把各家各種的意見，編彚起來，用不着摻入自已的主見，但冩一本文學槪論則不能這樣，這是需要作者有一固定的文學立塲，有系統理論的研究的，否則要使讀者感到茫無頭緖，感得内容蕪雜。醫如談到文學的定離吧，你固然可以引用如王爾德，泰納托爾斯托，滿列汗洛夫等的各種不同的意見，伹你切不要忘記你自已所處的時代，忘記自已的見解。你對於那些不同的意見，你都要有切要的按語，使讀者看了，明白那是對的，那是不對的，而不致覺到糢糊。還有，一本槪論，旣不能側重那一問題，更不宜忽視那一間題，而要各方面都顧到，（當然自已的意見，仍然是要的。）譬如，談到文　的變遷，你就不應該專談唯美主義或者完全抹殺唯美主義，你必須扼要的從古典主義談到社會主義現實主義爲止。槪論内容旣不宜太空洞，也不宜太複雜，與其兼收並蓄，弄成一篇糊塗賬，則寗可簡單而能把　理論的中心，文學槪論是給初學文學者或不一定專門研究文學只須獲得一點文學的基礎知識者而寫的讀物。</p>
<p>在讀者方面，讀一本文學槪論是不能抱着過大的希望的。最主要的目的，只在解决什麽是文學和文學的本質一些簡單的間題。如果你認爲一本槪論，應該是包羅萬象，讀了一本槪論，對於文學就應該無所不知，那是你自已的誇大。槪論能能給你的只是對於各個間題的一點正確的提示。有了提示以後如何，那是進一步的研究，槪論不能負責。要批評那一本槪論的好不好，第一自然是間那本書是不是有系統是那理論是否正確，所指示給我們的是否一條正路。如周君那樣感到空虚，得恐怕，我想大約是周君對於文學槪論有點近於苛求吧。</p>

<h3 id="c225">水性 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 公汗</p>
<p>天氣接連的大熱了近二十天，看上海報，幾乎每天都有下河洗浴，淹死了人的記載。這在才村裹，是很少見的。</p>
<p>才村多水，對於水的知識多，能浮水的也多。倘若不會浮水，是輕易不下水去的。這一種能浮水的本領，俗語謂之「識水識」。</p>
<p>這「識水性」，如果用了「買辦」的白話文，加以較詳的說明，則：一，是知道火能燒死人，水也能淹死人，但水的模樣柔和，好像容易親近，因而也容易上當；二，知道水雖能淹死人，却也能浮起人，現在就設法操縱牠，專來利用牠浮起人的這一面。三，便是學得操縱法。此法一熟，「識水性」的事就算完全了。</p>
<p>但在都會裹的人們，却不但不能浮水，而且似乎連水能淹死人的事情也都忘却了。平時毫無準備，臨時又不先一測水的深淺，遇到熱不可耐時，便脫衣一跳，倘不幸而正値深處，那當然是要死的。而且我覺得，當這時候，肯設法救助的人，好像都會裹也比鄕下少。</p>
<p>但救都會人恐怕也較難，因爲救者固然必須「識水性」，被救者也得相當的「識水性」的。他應該毫不用力，一任救者托着他的下巴，往淺處浮，倘若過於性急，拚命的向救者的身上爬，則救者倘不是好手，便只好連自已也沈下去。</p>
<p>所以我想，要下河，最好是預先學一點浮水工夫，不必到什麽公園的游泳塲，只要在河灘邊就行，但必須有内行人指導。其次，倘因了種種關係，不能學浮水，那就用竹竿先探一下河水的淺深，只在淺處敷衍敷衍，或者最穩當是舀起水來，只在河邊冲一冲。而最要緊的是要知道水有能淹死不會游泳的人的性質，並且還要牢牢的記住！</p>
<p>現在還要主張宣傳這樣的常識，看起來好像發瘋，或是志在「花邊」罷，但事實却證明着斷斷不如此。許多事是不能爲了討前進的批評家喜歡，一味閉了眼晴作豪語的。</p>
<h3 id="c226">夏天的旅行 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 劉明</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>夏天的早上，住厭了都市的人，單是在火車裹，看見了蒙着薄霧的靑色秧田，開着擰檬色小花的棉地和門前繫着一兩條黑色水年的人家，已够心情爽朗了，何况在終點地方，欣欣迎人的，有着點綴茶褐色風帆風海面和掠人衣袂的混潤海風呢。</p>
<p>夏天眞是勾人旅行的季節呵！</p>
<p>在赴吳淞去的車上、心裹禁不住暗自道樣詠嘆起來了。鶴見祐輔論夏天的旅行：「太陽將幾百天以來，所儲蓄的一切精力，摔在大地上。在這天和地的慘淡的戰爭中，人類當然不會獨獨震恐而退縮的。大抵的人，便跳出了討厭透了的自已的家，撲到大自然的懹裹去。這就是旅行。」這樣看來，在暑天，旅行的人倒彷彿近於戰士的了，其實呢，比如這次的游吳淞，我只覺得是不折不扣地偷閒而已，同自然搞爭之氣，是一點也沒有的。倘眞以炎天之下的遠足爲勇敢，則那些終日留在機器兩側鍋爐旁邊流汗的人，敢說他們是懦弱的嗎？他許鶴見氏的話是對的，不過這只適合於向「夏日炎炎正好眠」的胖子們說敎吧了。</p>
<p>旅行，是娛樂。尤其在夏天，這娛樂，應該普及到一切的人們，雖然，在此刻，只能算作夢想，但將來終歸是會實現的。</p>
<h3 id="c227">揮汗讀書 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— 陳子展</p>
<p>「揮汗讀書不已，人皆怪我何求。我豈更求榮達？日長聊以銷愛。」</p>
<p>這是北宋秦觀所作「寗浦書事」之一，大約是他因黨案削官，安置橫州時候的東西罷，不然，牢騷氣味也許不會這樣濃厚了。倘若他是個得意的闊人，他可以在「風亭水榭，沈李浮瓜，」度過他的伏天。倘若他是個與人無忤與世無爭的高人隱士，他可以在一北牎下臥，凉風時至，自謂是羲皇上人，」很舒服地逃過這炎熱的五六月。無奈他的命勳注定他落在士大夫的一個階層裹，却呌他享不到士大夫可以享到的福氣，倒呌他擔受士大夫不願擔負的重擔，在那炎炎的夏日，日千忒長，他只好揮汗讀書，消憂遺悶了！</p>
<p>道幾大，上海天氣特熱，我實在禁受不住。一面讀書，一面揮汗，爲了什麽？我自已也答不出，記起秦觀的一首詩，不覺有問感了。</p>
<p>本來這樣的大熱天，最不宜於讀書。有冷氣管的電影院倒可以去看看，有電風扇的咖啡館也可以去談，同樣有避暑設備的跳舞廳更可以去耍耍，自然，冰結漣，冰凍汽水果物之類是不可少的。不然，就辜負了這現代的都市文明了。不過在這樣的都市住膩了，也會想到山林郊野的，尤其時在這炎熱的夏天。所以廬山，莫干山，以及黃山，雞公山等處，就成了都市裹的文明人　　高等華人，以及外國紳士避暑銷夏的「聖地」。</p>
<p>至於最大多數沒有福氣到這種聖地云避暑的人，又不能不住在都市，住在都市又不能享受避暑的科學文明，原也只是活該。活該又不甘服，如果徼倖識字，讀書銷夏，倒是一種最好的辦法，何况有什麽憂患的人，還可藉此銷憂呢！</p>
<p>自然，這個時候並不是讀書的季節，各種學校不都是放暑假了麽？然而揮汗讀書·此鋤禾種菜，究竟是有天堂地獄之别的。可見同是「火傘高張」，有的藉此享福，有的因此更見勞苦，只有我們書獃了，揮汗讀書，苦中有樂，樂中有苦，還是一種苦樂均衡的生活，最爲理想的生活。</p>
<p>汗，並不是可以詛咒的東西。一個人在應當出汗的時候，不出汗，便是有了病，阿斯匹靈，麻黃桂枝就成了聖藥。汗孔閉塞，好像塞了鼻孔，呼吸不靈，那是難過的。汗水分泌不出，好像尿水撒不下來，也是過不下去的。出一點汗，倒不算什麽大犠牲，少爺小姐，老爺太太，你們可不要害怕。一般文人，肩不能挑，手不能提，勞力的機會極少，汗水也犧牲不許多。莫說揮汗喫苦，這樣的大熱天，讀書也出汗，不讀書也出汗。何况「讀書不忘救國，救國不忘讀書」，讀書「有意想不到之效力」。出自已的汗，讀自已的書，救自已的國，又何樂而不爲呢？</p>
<p>倘若有少爺小姐發宣言，喊口號，反對我的揮汗讀書論，我並不堅持我的原來的主張，以求貫澈，這一點世故我是淸楚了的。這一篇困話，太說畏了，就引相傅爲頑童逃學的一首詩作爲話尾罷。</p>
<p>「春來不是讀書天，夏日炎炎正好眠。秋有蚊來科有雪，一心收拾到明年。」</p>
<h3 id="c228">熱在南京（三） <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— 曙山</p>
<p>除此以外、那就要數到第一公園，秦淮河，莫愁湖，及玄武湖這幾處，雖然這些地方又是私娼，流氓等的出沒地，更有一班惡少所組織的什麽「採花團」，常到這裹來對一般年靑婦女大施其獵艷乎段，令人看着有些不耐煩。</p>
<p>××</p>
<p>第一公園，因其地近秦淮兩岸娼區，遊人當然是極多。復因其中的逍遙遊茶飯館，照例的要開設露天茶社，近更有人設一露天電影院，以致其吸引力遂格外的來得大。就是沒錢吃茶和看電影者，也未嘗不可以走進裹面去，或坐在凳子上，或躺在草地上，迎風開懹，心怡神爽，自比悶在家裹要好得多了。何况更有許多男女之間的活劇，會在你的眼前不斷的一幕一幕的展開呢？</p>
<p>××</p>
<p>秦淮河，自閘開後，水已不臭。只要有錢有就可以買舟一葉，放棹中流，通宵逹旦，亦無不可。雖從嚴禁歌女陪客人下河，並取締一切歌妓在船上賣唱，但你如果把她帶到船上來當做情人一般的談心，逗笑，偎倚，措弄，親吻，擁抱······等，又有誰個敢來干涉呢？再說不准歌女侑酒吧，至多不過酒館老板受一點損失，而在客人儘可以把她們帶去開大旅館的房間，或到露天茶社去呌侑茶和冰淇淋，或到高而夫球塲，或坐汽車去兜等，無非不過變一點花樣罷了。至於秦淮小公圜，只因爲是花舫來往的碼頭，又被露天茶社佔據了半面，更爲下等私娼的徘徊所，於是遂不可以流連了。</p>
<p>××</p>
<p>玄武湖，這雖然也在城外，只因爲市府很注力於此湖心的五洲公園之開闢，業已築有柏油馬路直達於其間，遂比較的便當些。但其間的荷花自被前年的大水淹沒後，迄今還未恢復了舊觀；又湖水已漸漸的涸竭，遊艇遂不便行駛，加之玄武門於午夜還照常要鎖，時間則受其限制；因之這熱閙也只在下午以至黃昏的時分，其後便漸漸的冷靜而不能及秦淮河。</p>
<p>××</p>
<p>莫愁湖，是在小西門之外，其近城市的形勢，約與中華門外的雨花台是差不多·但交通還不及那裹了。此等地方，只因荒僻，奇事遂多，如雨花台下的某少婦，在外露宿，竟被强姦，這不過是因見報載而爲其中的代表之一。說至莫愁湖畔的奇聞，首如某大學生與某女職員，因於九龍橋游泳之緣而結爲愛侣，日前夜間同到此乘凉，終於在那樹蔭之下幹起野合的勾當，又適巧被流氓王小六子擅見了，當約許多同黨來促姦，並把他們男女二人嬲入某小客棧中，以與之談判，結果終被敲去一筆竹槓才了事。又如附近商販某之孿生姊妹花，前天晚間一同去乘凉，流氓竟敢雇好馬車俟其於歸途，夥刦其妹馳往濱江鄕，擬强姦後而逼爲其妻，幸當時就被追獲。諸如此類，時有所聞，無非這都可說是炎熱所造的罪孽。</p>
<p>××</p>
<p>此外還有些露天花園或屋頂花園，也都是供吃茶納凉的所在。第一爲城中大世界所擴張的露天花圜，在四象橋裹邊，環水築園，却也凉爽，其中有京劇，有電影，有高而夫球塲，有幾隻游艇，及徧設茶座，要吃西餐，則有上海咖啡店承辦，要吃中菜，亦有川館皇后飯店包攬，總之這是銷金窟，無錢却莫想問津。又如果你不帶着摩登女郎一同去，或是爲着追逐女人而去的，那也就沒甚意思。其次爲安樂酒店的屋頂花園，南京大戲院樓上的江蘇花園，及新街口的中央花園等，也都是有閑階級的公子哥兒和太太小姐們的納凉的所在，與窮人無干。</p>

<p>— 星野</p>
<p>再到了芝加哥</p>
<p>在地圖上，美國是一個和中國差不多大的國家。在事實上，美國的繁盛，大半集中於從紐約到芝加哥的一條直綫上。在這數百英里以内，排着做美國產業本命的許多大城市，大礦山，大工塲。天上有飛機成天的往往返返，電話電報，忙個不了。幾十條鐵路，像一束大鐵索把這個大產業區域緊緊的聨接起來。在這個交通網裹面，一切是快，是忙，是熱烈，是喧閙。</p>
<p>坐了一夜的大汽車，在忙與快中混慣了的我居然也覺到相當的疲倦。尤其是當汽車穿過高峻的山脈，向着被煤烟董黑了的畢次堡城（Ｐｉｔｔｓｂｕｒｇ)的時候。</p>
<p>畢次堡－那美國無數的大產業家，大資本家的故鄕的畢次堡，是我認爲全世界最醜最髒的城市。灰色的房屋，巔巔倒倒的建在那沒有一條緑草的礦山上面。街道是那樣的狹小，道上的行人，不分男女，都有一副吃人的樣子。牆上窗上塗着大紅色的廣吿，像毒蛇口上留着的鮮血。</p>
<p>在山均裹面，千百條的烟囱，吐出薰天的煤烟。在那地獄似的製造廠裹面，多少的美國人在出賣他們的汗血，汗血構成了鋼鐵大王，鉛業大王們的幾千萬幾萬萬的財產。畢次堡的鋼鐵和鉛建築成紐的的華爾街，而紐約的華兩街上面，浮着一個所謂華盛頓政府。做過三朝財政總長的老美隆，便是畢次堡的驕兒。曾經操縱歐美兩大陸產業命運的加匿奇，是畢次堡鋼鐵鋪子裹做學徒出身的。自加匿奇的鋼鐵公司，賣給了銀行大王摩根以後，那位紐約銀行術的暴君，便用他的合衆國鋼鐵公司，操縱住美國乃至世界的產業的命運。</p>
<p>好容易離開了畢次堡的煤烟。汽車用每小時五英里的带度，向西疾跑。大城市像念珠一樣的串成這一道資本主義國家奇妙鏈鎖。這邊是享利福特們的金錢所鑄成的汽車城；那邊是椽皮業的中心的阿可籠城。克來扶輪，他來唐等城，聚集着幾十百萬的工人，在那邊替美國製造或好或惡的將來。新的工業城市，在過去五十年内，像香　般伸長出來。在這許多繁星般的都市裹面，芝加哥的地位，好像是領袖羣倫的明月。</p>

<p>第四章右邊的正手拍擊法</p>
<h3 id="c268">球術上最重要的拍擊式的分析和各種擊法異點的說明 <a href="#c268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>還搫對方來球的時候、落地搫Ｇｒｏｕｎｄ－Ｓｔｒｏｋｅｓ要佔到百分之八十、臨空擊Ｖｏｌｌｅｙｓ絶少、（落地搫是球落地後反躍時的還擊、而臨空擊是球未曾落地時的還擊、）應付落地球的拍擊法共分二種、一是、正手拍擊法、這是球員面向着網的時候、來球反躍到他的右邊、（專對用右手拍球的球員而言、至於用左手的球員則反是、）一是、反乎拍擊法、那是球員面向着網的時候、來球反躍到他的左邊、</p>
<p>正手落地拍擊法、應用的時候極多、所以是球藝的基本手法、通常有經騐的球員、在可能範圍之内、總是應用此法去還擊來球、並且都認爲這是最容易和最自然的手法、</p>
<p>正乎拍擊時、球員的右肩是在來球的後面、所以右手向前掃動時、就有極大的拍繫力量、但是反手拍擊時球員的右户必略爲聳到來球的前面、此時拍擊的動作、不免要受到擊肘的奪　、沒有正手式來得自然、有的球員專門採用反手式、能做到和正手式所產生的同等效力、更有少數的球員反手練得極精、他們有時很樂於用那一邊來拍擊、</p>
<p>正乎拍擊時、乎腕祗要順着向前扭動、那是極自然的、反而言之、反手拍擊時、手腕就要反過節骨向前扭動、若是球拍、和來球相距離的角度不凖確時、手腕就有被鎖的困難、所以乎腕的扭動在正乎拍擊時、較之在反乎拍擊時、要自由得多、還有的球員在反乎后擊的時候、乎腕簡直不會扭轉、完全是硬着去應付的、</p>
<p>在上前迎擊來球的時候、球員要選擇他的拍擊的方位、當然是可能的、决定了方位以後、就將足部趕緊順着所採用的正的式或反手式、踏在來球的左邊或右邊、至於究竟要如何選擇拍擇的方位、那就完全要根據球員立在斱區上的地位和對手所立的地位、才能决定、若是來球落在塲區近中央的部分時、就極容易决定拍擊的方位、並且在這種情形之下、採用正手式、總是要佔到十分之九、若是來球在離身體極遠的一邊、球員就是要選擇拍擊的方位、也是不可能的、於是就祇好酌量情形、去應会此種危局、</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>上面已經說過，所有的女官，都是滿籍的高級官吏的女兒；我和我的妹妹容齡，便是裕庚公爵的愛女。我父親很早就受了朝廷的命令，到各國去充任出使大臣：所以我們自小便受西洋敎育。恕我誇口！在那時候像我們一般的能够通曉洋文的女人，眞是絶無僅有：因此太后對於我們姊妹兩個人，也格外的看重一些；而别的人，更是羡慕我們到了極點！當時雖沒有「首席女官」等特殊的名號，但在事實上，我們的確好算是全體女官的領袖。</p>
<p>女官中有兩個是慶親王有女兒。其時慶親王正充着軍機大臣的職務，自然也是一個頂大頂大的大官了！還有一個是順王福晉。說起這個人的來歷，倒又是很大的。伊和隆裕皇后是同胞的姊妹，皇太后也就是伊的姑母，關係原該是非常密切的：伊之所以被選入宫中來，充女官的緣故，是皇太后想給些好處給伊自已的親戚。這樣說來，皇太后必然是很能體恤伊自已的親戚的了。然而事實恰巧相反！不知道爲了什麽緣故，！我至今也還不曾明白，或者也是一種神經變態病。！伊對於那些皇族，和伊自已的母家這些較近的至戚，都是很切齒地痛恨着的。伊雖握着中國全部的政權，儘可隨意把任何官員更動，但伊竟從不曾使伊的那些親戚當過一個位置比較重要，撈錢比較容易的官；所以凡跟伊有直接關係的親戚，除却極少數的一部份之外，大多全窮得和下等人差不多了。</p>
<p>還有一點很値得說一說的，便是太后生前對於溥儀！卽此刻在東三省給日本人當「傀儡」的溥儀，（譯者按：作者原文亦大書ＪａｐａｎｓPuppet，頗能予歐美人以深刻的印像，可慰。可慰。）！那一家的人，更是特别的痛惡嫉妒；每逢有人提起他們，伊就要蹙額不歡了。（八七）</p>

<p>— &gt;淸瘦</p>
<p>吾們嘉定地方，在東里有一個老嫗，說來：眞是奇怪：閱者們，不要以爲在下是造出來的子虚鳥有，其實倒很眞確，一些沒有裝點；老嫗，姓朱，他的年紀，也已經七十多歲了。他的老翁在世時，有中等以上的資產，不過是異常吝嗇，平日無論吃的着的，都一錢不肯落在虚空地；就算賣一個銅子豆腐，他會得分作兩日吃，譬如今天先付銅子一個，只取豆腐小錢五文，還有一半，須等到明天再取了；你想！不是一個弳濟專家麽？所奇怪的老翁去世的前一年，忽然大興土木，造了一座高廳大屋，可惜落成不多幾天，那就死神降臨，亭福日澕；而且又沒有親生的兒了，所有的房產田地，自然被同宗的旁支享有了；現在，老嫗呢！只賸得一副老骨頭，似乎反受着伶仃孤苦的悲境，這是什麽緣故呢？這種老年人的性情，在姑媳中間，自然不會和睦，所以他祇得一人獨居；據說：象這幾天，熱度逹到一百零四度，是何等的怕熱，哦上老嫗，還是上半身雖已袒胸露臂，手中執着綿袴，兩足踏在燒得煊紅的銅爐上，尙口中呼脚冷不已；不曉得的，總認以爲害了神經病，實在他年雖高肛神志還百二十分的淸夾哩！或有人說：他上半身是過着夏季，下半身仍是過着冬季，倘照他的一人特殊的生理方面講起來，也好定他是二重人格，所以吾把他寫出來，供獻閱者們一笑。</p>

<p>太陽一落由，田岸上來來往往的反忙碌起來，又該是農民們回家歇息的愉快時候了。</p>
<p>男子們在河灘頭用土布醮着河水拭去身上的污垢，一身的疲勞困憊早和污垢一同給冲得精光啦。一塊板和四根木條組成的矮台了在每家門口擺着；一碟鹽蠶豆，一竹籃冷飯，一小缸冰茶，旣淸爽又簡便。只要你去瞄一下他們的吃相，你準會相信這些東西比城市裹的山珍海味，還够味得多多啦。</p>
<p>從亂柴堆裹飛散出來的火花在塲角邊像螢光般的閃爍着。夏夜的凉風帶來了輕快和舒適。老年人反着水烟筒毫無限制着閑談着；從宣統皇帝登基談起，一直說到村裹頭細屑的芝麻菉豆事。有時候連那些早已霉腐了的數年或數十年前的往事，也會在他們掉光了牙板的乾掄嘴巴裹復活起來，靑年漢子們赤着膊橫在板門上看淸天，蔚藍的天空裹有他們渴念着的姑娘們的微笑。孩子們在切着明天給耕吿吃的草料，當然免不了彼此爭吵。夾雜着含羞的淺笑聲，令人聽來覺得别有風味的是那些天眞無邪的村姑們在學唱着偶然從城市裹聽得來的愛情歌曲。我說初夏的鄕村夜景是一幅滿含詩意的圖畫啦。</p>

<p>某一晚，已經是三點多鐘了，客堂樓裹的王先生，打着後門回家。王先生雖然有正當的職業，但因爲受在外面賭錢喝酒嫖妓，所以家庭經濟，是十分拮据的，這也就是他們夫妻倆時常吵嘴打架的主要原因。</p>
<p>這一晚，王先生混到了半夜回來，不住的哈着呵欠，急於想恢復幾晚沒有好生睡覺的疲勞，但是王師母却怎肯輕輕把他放過，所以當王先生才反帽子除下時，便伸開了手，向他討已經過子期的房租及伙食開销之費。</p>
<p>雖然這些都是每個家庭裹生活之所必需，但是王先生是嚢中如洗，因爲這一晚，王先生是已把口袋裹所有的幾個錢，都輸完了。口袋裹沒有錢，沒法敷衍，於是王師母是開始鳴咽了。</p>
<p>王先生賭輸了，本已蹩着一肚了悶氣，如今見王師母哭了，使索性開口駡起人來。王師母本已受了委屈，到此便搶地呼天，嚎啕大哭。接着是淸脆的巴掌聲，沉重的擲物聲，和着孩子給驚醒之後，呼娘喚母的駭哭聲，混成了一片。同居的四五份人家，都給吵得不能入夢。但是誰都不高興起來解勸，因爲在已往，已屢次的這樣搬演着。</p>
<p>四點鐘，五點鐘，一直哭吵着閙到天明，王先生恨恨地出去了，王師母還是哭着。</p>

<p>— 魏詠箎</p>
<p>菉豆之爲物，據本草所載：其性溫良左力能解暑消渴，夏飲是汁，百病不生。我不用菉頭湯者，蓋亦有故。解暑湯者，蓋亦有故。因見紅樓夢，有一段情重愈斟文字：原來賢黛兩人，各有一段心事，存在胸中，只不好說出來。今賓玉又聽見黛玉說說好姻緣三個字，越發逆了已意，他便賭氣咬牙，將頸上通　玉摘下來，摔了又砸。黛玉看他摔砸那啞八東西，更急，幸襲人趕來奪下來，便　笑勸賓玉道：你和妹妹拌嘴，犯不着砸它，倘或砸壤了，呌他心裹臉上怎麽過的去？黛玉聽了這話，說到自已心坎上來，可見竇玉連襲人都不如，越發傷心大哭起來，心一煩惱，連方纔吃的解暑湯，便承受不住，哇了一聲吐出來。由此可知，大觀園内，亦以菉豆湯解暑消夏，茲特節錄出來，以證明菉豆湯性能解暑，連林黛玉都吃，可見其眞價値了。故我不用菉豆湯標題，而借伊口内連香唾一路吐出來的解暑湯標題，而借示拈題之妙。閒話收起，再談正文：</p>
<p>菉頭湯這食品，每届夏令，無論窮富，大家小户，因其價廉益身，又以習俗相傳關，在當日未受外國利用水冷食傳染時，南方人除以西瓜認爲消夏良伴外，餘則皆以此爲解暑不二法門。但一交秋，食西瓜者，恐患肚瀉，輙不再問津，萬一秋老虎光臨，仍以此佳品對付之。但是菉豆湯及菉豆粥煮法大有出入，茲蔣研究所得，以供戲於讀者之前：</p>
<p>據說，菉豆湯必要條件，在初煮時，放水必須有一定標凖；比如作一升菉豆的湯，須放三升半或四升水，恰到好處。如煮菉豆粥，因加一把米的關係，非四升足水不可。無論是湯是粥，起初須用猛火煮，俟其開滾，再用慢火溫透，待其豆身完全開花，須用國貨蔗糖，慘和調匀，出鍋後，稍凉飲之，其味極佳。最忌初煮水不足，在半開化中加水，則其味與未加水者，有天壤之别。謂予不信，一試便知不謬。</p>

<h3 id="c297">女子職業的澈底解放 <a href="#c297" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e297" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">297</a></h3>
<p>— 乾序</p>
<p>誰也得承認，現在中國的社會仍是男性中心社會。</p>
<p>在名義上，或者在表面上看起來，女子已經得到了解放，有女的中委，女的公務員，女的從業員，女的工友：政治，經濟，敎育上女性與男性都郭有同等的機會，同樣的權利，似乎是已經達到眞個平等的境界。</p>
<p>但在實際上觀察，我们可以看到女了職業的背面（包括公務員從業員等），敷上了很濃厚的「裝飾品」「市招」等等的色彩，以致不能免於「花」瓶的侮辰。這是不是女子本身的罪惡呢？數千年男性中心社會的歷史限制了女的意識·封建遺毒决定了女子的命運，在現世界的某一個角落裹仍舊有以女子爲商品的買賣，以漂亮的臉蛋作招來主顧的手段的，仍免不了以女子作商品的見解。</p>
<p>所謂「享樂性的職業」的舞女，也不是盡人可爲的，至少必從具備以下的條件：（一）美麗的臉龐，（二）苗條的身材，（三）能極盡裝飾和做作之能事。其他的條件當然還有，然亦不必過多的列舉，總而言之，祇須能够攖得廣大的男子的受戀，滿足每一個男子的慾望，取得農富的代價·所以，所謂「享樂性的職業女了」者，亦不過「性的商品」而已。</p>
<p>世界經濟恐慌的潮流，動盪到每一個角落裹，使得許多婦妇都不能在家庭裹安居，同時有一部分婦女看到未來的危機，於是儘力的喴出「婦女解放來」；同時有一部分的男子，也覺得負擔太重，往後並且有負擔不下的危險，於是也跟着喊「婦女應當解放」。數千年被壓迫之下的婦女，一旦要跑到『男性中心社會」裹來爭强鬥勝，當然是不容易討好的。</p>
<p>然而女子也像男子社會層同樣的複雜時代的巨輪儘管加速度的轉，儘管有許多許多女子被抛棄在遠遠的地方，儘管有許多女子墮入商品的深淵·但同時也有許多女了子跑在時代的前面，艱難困苦地奮進着，奮鬥着。</p>
<p>女子之所以會流入於「商品」，誠如「波兒」先生所說是「社會制度的不良」，然而並不是「心」先生所說的單純的打破虚榮」和「提倡節儉」所能糾正，因爲旣已做了資本家的「商品」以後的已的職業女子，並不能容許你自由的『打破』或『提倡』。因爲「打破」就是打破了你自已的飯碗，節儉就會節去了你的職業，這是與資本家經濟利害衝突的關係。這，當然不是說職業女子不應當節儉，而是說在此一情形之下可能。</p>
<p>同時，站在被支配地位的職業女子（求業女子當然也在内），要求得絶對的經濟獨立，眞是比登天還難的事，而况處在這災荒頻仍全國經濟破產失業充斥的社會裹。</p>
<p>要攺革整個社會制度的不良，固然不是女子一方面的事：然而要求得女子職業底的解放，則必須把「男性中心社會」攺爲「兩性共同社會』才行。</p>

<p>— 洪奔</p>
<p>××弟：</p>
<p>你的滿懹悽愴的來信，本已收讀多久了。爲什麽遲遲未覆呢？不是忙，我正閒得說不出的無聊。因爲學校已放假，我又無心去作其他鑽營，自然是很閒啦。但爲什麽連你的信都懶得覆呢？這倒使我非常感着困難。因爲你提出的問題，實在太嚴重了到底是死守家園還是出外飄泊的好？</p>
<p>這可是一個嚴重的問題呵，我想上了不知多少時候，到今日才有一個决定的意見。現在我就把它寫在下面：</p>
<p>本來現在有不少的人嚷首：「回到農村去」，「到民間去」，前者彷彿始自近今，大槪因爲近年農村破產不堪，以爲要中國今後有辦法，須要從復興農村做起，所以有人嚷出這麽一句口號。後者則確乎是老調了，是那般文學家的口號。這樣，已經飄泊在外的都應回到老巢去，那麽，你本來在老巢裹的還作什麽幻想呢？守着莫動吧，亡命都死守着莫動吧！</p>
<p>然而不然，我的意見恰恰與這相反。呵××弟，這使你聽了，我遙想你定在得决的笑，而將引我爲莫逆交吧！是的，這並不是我的投樣，我爲什麽不主張你死守着家園呢？我爲什麽贊同到外邊來飄泊呢？我不是止有結論，而沒有前提。且看我下面的說辭吧！</p>
<p>你自已不也說過麽，家鄕是那般艱險，人情是那般冷酷，大家以爲你在大學裹唸過書，就都看你像是一頭蛟龍，可是事實上你是那麽的使他們失望，旣不能因爲在大學裹唸過書，能够升官發財，以符證他們的讀書有用論。而且你竟連挽聨歌賦都不能做，使得他們那般瞧不起，這樣，你還能守下去麽？</p>
<p>要是你是富有的話，那倒也又好打算，自已有老米飯吃，關起門坐在家裹，裝做一個瞎子聾子，人家的嘻笑謾駡，都可置不理，這樣也就得了。</p>
<p>然而，假若眞的如此的話，那也未免太斵喪了人生的意義，黑暗的人間，混沌的社會，正很迫切的需要我們去攺造。不過事實是那麽的嚴酷，攺造，談何容易？倘若以一已的力量，去忘想肩荷這種責任，不但無補於事實，還要墜階自已於深淵。因爲這不是一個枝葉的問題，也不是人的問題，而是整個的社會制度部題，大前都沒有出路，怎能去談枝葉，那不是必然要碰壁麽！而且現在鄕間舊勢力的雄厚，較前尤甚，隨時隨地足以墜落靑年。而且，假若你果眞是富有的話，根本就會自已墜落着自已。</p>
<p>可惜的，也是最好的，你不但不富有，而竟是一個光蛋，從你的來信中可以看得出，就是鄕間的生活程度那麽低，你也幾乎感受「在陳」的危困了　你旣窮到這種地步，尙何所戀於故園？細察你的語味，似乎有些怨恨你自已的命運，其實這是錯了，茫茫斯世，如何一樣潦倒者，正不知有多少，這責任分明是要社會擔當的。</p>
<p>我覺得，朋友，你應該到外面來飄流，你只有到外面來飄流。但你若追問我到外面來有什麽把握，有什麽出路？那我不要忠誠的說，具體的好處確實也是一樣的沒有。不過我總覺得一個活生生的靑年，與其窮困在家園，毌寗餓死在異鄉，我一向就抱定着這種生意，茫十六年到現在，我已飄泊了整八年了，雖曾挨過餓，但畢覔也還活着。而在精神上，認識上，種種切切，確實獲得了益處不少。</p>
<p>我之所以遊說你出外，意思就在這裹。我覺得一個現代的靑年，應該飽嘗</p>
<p>是，就必要接受一番流浪的敎訓。我更覺得所謂流浪　，飄泊，也並不是單方面的壤意思，在其他一方面，它正蘊藏着無限的眞理，無限的前進意識。</p>
<p>××弟，我的親愛的朋友，你究竟怎麽辦呢？胡謅的我說了這麽一大套，到底是不是眞的合乎你的口胃？合乎你的見解？最後，我有一句話要說，人間，社會，决不是永遠的黑暗，永遠的混沌。總有發放光明的一天到臨，完了，祝這康健。　　你友洪奔</p>
<h3 id="c299">悼劉半農 <a href="#c299" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e299" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">299</a></h3>
<p>— 茂華</p>
<p>中國音韵學專家劉復博士是在本月十四日下午二時一刻在北平恊和醫院逝世了，全國各地無論識　不識的學術界中人，都在著文悲悼，表示痛惜。個人因與劉復博士有同鄕之誼，多少知道他一點生平，故此想從他早年的苦學方面提出來說一說。</p>
<p>劉復一名半農，世居江陰東鄕三甲里地方，不過在他父親手裹，便搬到城裹西大街來住了。從禮延學校出來後，便進常州第五中學讀書，因爲有些才氣，不服那班老朽敎師的指導，所以是不曾畢業的。離開五中之後，就到上海來翻譯小說，（那時署名爲劉半儂，實在是頗爲鴛鴦蝴蝶化的）直至現在，我們在中華書局還可以買到劉譯小說「貓探」，「歐陸縱橫秘史」，「帳中說法」，「黑肩巾」等書不久被北大校長蔡元培先生所賞識，覺得他流落在上海頗爲可惜，便呌他到北大圖書館裹去做事。在那里，劉復先生是有機會接觸了浩瀚學海，後來的成爲專門學者，基礎不消說在那時候便早就打好了的。</p>
<p>劉復先生的學問好了，蔡元培先生便呌他在北大當起助敎來，但因爲資格的欠缺，不時受着眼高於頂的學生們的奚落，這樣，劉復先生自然是不幹了，剛巧有一個機會，便由蔡元培先生幫忙送到法國留學去了。</p>
<p>記不淸在彼邦是五年還是六年，劉復先生獲得了法國國家承認的文學博士回國了。法國國家承認的文學博士，據說在遠東還是第一人，那便是說，在學術昌明的日本也還是沒有的。那時候，剛巧我們江陰有戰事，奉軍把吳國太（孫權的母親）所造的賓塔也轟掉了，然而却沒有完轟掉，祗轟掉了半個塔尖。上那半個塔尖正像是個鋼筆尖，於是地方上的人都說：「江陰出了洋狀元了」！而所謂洋狀元，當然便然便是指的劉復博士。</p>
<p>劉復先生是有名的博士了，各大學自然得爭先羅致，唯恐或後，和未出國時候是眞不可同日而語了。這其間，劉復博士復親自參加五四運動，以劉半農的筆名與小說家魯迅等著文鼓吹，且以研究音韵學的餘暇，以方言寫詩，（如有名的瓦釜集）於是劉半農便成了衆所咸知的詩人文學家了。</p>
<p>但是不幸得很，劉半農先生竟以正當有爲的壯年而作古了！陳子展先生以爲是大衆語問題建設上的重大損失，我也與有同感。</p>
<p>看到劉半農先生的身世，我們再不用費什麽解釋，便可以知道他是怎樣努力苦學的一個人了。而且他的弟弟天華先生也一樣，以一個在小學校裹當敎師連琴都不會彈的人，却會成德國的音樂博士，却會成中國有數的音樂家！假如說不是努力苦學，又那里會得到到成功呢？</p>
<p>然而他們兄弟兩個是先後逝世了，這使我們敬致無限的悼意。</p>

<p>當在汽笛嚮了的時候，太陽的赤臉，已被大煤山的尖頂掩蓋去了。一幅深　的黑影　就蒙上了這　大的平原。晒熟了的河水，冒着白烟的圓田，漸漸的</p>

<p>在减低了牠的熱度。樹林裹的鳥兒，也開始的成羣結隊在空中翱翔。</p>
<p>當在汽笛嚮了的時候，那遠所的村莊，那散在平原上的小屋，無數凌亂的烟囱，都在冒出着一縷縷地濃烟，蜿蜒的在屋頂盤旋。那黃臉的村婦，那瘦弱的小孩，有的拿着剷刀和竹筐，有的拿着鋤頭和水桶，在那田園中，在那樹林裹，採取着他們的燒柴，和食料，灌漑着他們的麥田和菜疏。</p>
<p>當在汽笛嚮了的時候，躺在鐵路旁的街道，漸漸地熱鬧了；來來往往的人物，有工人和村婦，有老人和小孩。商店的店夥，在高聲的呌賣，茶樓的堂倌，在走動的招呼。一日中的二十四小時，在這裹就祗有這一刹那才是熱鬧的世界。靜寂的空氣變成了喧囂，停滯的金錢在四處的流動。</p>
<p>當在汽笛嚮了的時候，昇降機的鐵鍊不信的在旋轉，一小車又一小車的煤塊，從地底下吊上了山旁，做着運輸工作的工人，一個個都在揮着豆大的汗珠。推動着那有二百斤重量的煤車，他們不管滿身是在流着大汗，他們忘去了是赤着足在踏着地上的煤屑。只是爲着最後的一次火車就要開出，空着的車箱是等着他们運煤去裝塡。</p>
<p>當在汽笛嚮了的時候，一羣的工人都站在昇降機的四週，上工者是一個個精神充足地談笑着他們生活上的閒話，有的是　在吃着那堅硬了的燒餅和饅頭。但那些下工的，却是個個滿臉煤灰和汗珠，疲倦的低着頭喘着氣，傘着那半明未滅的炭精燈，拖着那沉重的脚步，踏上了他們的歸路。</p>
<p>當在汽笛嚮了的時候，這幾里内的一切的人們和事物；是都在震動了。</p>

<p>— 村因</p>
<p>桃樹結實了。</p>
<p>在阿生的心中，是多麽的快樂啊！</p>
<p>發芽，開花，生果········賣掉，化錢，糶米，飽腹······。這此，他每天想着的。</p>
<p>這次，他看見桃樹上掛了許多桃了。啊，他該怎樣地自幸啊！</p>
<p>等不到成熟，他已摘了下來。很他細的一只只裝進筐裹去，捨不得的自已也吃了一只。</p>
<p>只有四株樹，他一個子要靠着它過一年。</p>
<p>年紀是這麽地老了虧得他的身子並不多病。</p>
<p>他揀了個好日子，一個挑着担子上城去。一路上，他想了好多的事情。他竟然也想把剩下來的錢去買一件拷綢的短衫哩！他也想到去請一個泥水匠來，把他的老屋的漏洞刷補一下。</p>
<p>他也很厭恨，對于他的一個沒有剃的長髮和鬚鬚。</p>
<p>桃子，有幾只是紅的。其餘都還沒有怎樣的大熟。它们都離開了家鄉，而任人們去啖割了，在它們小小的心靈中，或许會怨恨人們太殘暴了！</p>
<p>阿生，流掉了许多汗，終於到一個熱鬧的地方停下來。</p>
<p>拭去了他的汗後，就張開他的破𡂈�</p>
<p>嚨喊··</p>
<p>「要買桃了？甜桃了！······」</p>
<p>差不多每一個人，經過這副桃了担的時候，他們至少要向他看上一眼。因爲他的聲音喊得太可憐了！而且還異樣的沉着。</p>
<p>早晨喊到中午，祇得到二十多個銅子。</p>
<p>那顆年老的心，已在發悉了！</p>
<p>太陽，暴烈的晒在街上。也晒在每一個勞苦者的肌肉上。祇有那些汽車中的人，很舒適地在做　着華貴的夢。</p>
<p>黃昏近了！他還是不斷地在喊着。</p>
<p>他的心中是多麽的焦急！雖然到明天還可以出來賣的！</p>
<p>當他的喉嚨發不出聲音的當兒，太陽已逃掉了。</p>
<p>嘆着氣，又挑着那副重担回去。</p>
<p>一天不進食，在他早並不希奇的。</p>
<p>第二天，照樣的又在早上挑了那副担進城。</p>
<p>太陽還沒有爬到頭頂。</p>
<p>一個警察，拿了棍子向他干涉了。</p>
<p>「這兒是走路的地方！不可以······」</p>
<p>「先生，小生意人·········」</p>
<p>皺了眉，哀哀地苦求着。</p>
<p>「不行！警察舉起棍了來，打過去」。</p>
<p>頓時阿生在背上暴起了一條紅的痕跡。他痛住了這痛的地方，跪了下去。</p>
<p>「先生，苦命人······要吃飯······」</p>
<p>「快挑着走！不然······」</p>
<p>「先生·········」</p>
<p>阿生走上去抱住他的腿，求着。</p>
<p>不提防，一脚！那有釘子的皮鞋！正踢在他的胸前。</p>
<p>他痛極了！趕緊挑着走。</p>
<p>奔回家。氣已喘得很利害！</p>
<p>就這樣地量了過去。</p>
<p>醒來，嘔了許多血塊，把下半領的鬍鬚染紅了。</p>
<p>他不知道道是什麽一回事。</p>
<p>「我沒有搶錢，殺人······？」</p>
<p>他常常輕輕地自問着··</p>
<p>幾天後，那籃了裹的沒有熟透的桃子，在腐爛了！</p>
<h3 id="c302">蒼蠅 <a href="#c302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>
<p>— 賓符</p>
<p>幾天以來，我眞氣悶而且暴燥極了。晚上旣因受了熱的威脅和臭蟲的糾纏而睡不了好覺，白天昵，心相揀個沒有太陽的地方放把籐椅躺着打盹，誰知那紅頭的芝蔴的蒼蠅『將軍』們又不肯放鬆你，偏要營營地在你的臉孔上耳畔脇子下足尖縫裹亂爬亂舐，聒刺不休。</p>
<p>尤其是當人剛將朦朧睡去的時候，這東西偏要出其不意地在你的身上任何部分吮一嘴，會使人突的跳了起來，流出一身大汗。等你拿起芭蕉扇去打牠，牠早已一溜烟飛得沒影沒踪了。這樣毫無休止地挑　，把我弄到哭笑不得，我幾乎要暴燥得發狂了。</p>
<p>吃飯的時候，人們還沒有坐下去，那些將軍們却毫不客氣地早先在飯菜上面停着了，你趕牠一趕，牠便在空中沒命的打了一個大廻旋，你要追蹤牠的去處也是不可能了：打了廻旋，牠好像覺得你們已不在追尋牠了，便又迅捷地飛來桌角落裹或碗中央蹲着了：尤可惡者，譬如你剛攙了一又小菜想往嘴裹送，那紅頭大蒼蠅恰巧飛到小菜碟上，你便不得不放下了將到嘴的小菜而去趕蒼蠅，這種可厭的打渾，够多使人難受？</p>
<p>這可就牠的表面行動而言，已够使我們這樣憎厭。若以科學的眼光觀之，牠又是怎樣毒險可怕的東西啊，牠帶着傳染病菌，牠無異是人類的刺客！</p>
<p>在這樣情形之下，我們是再沒有意興去現味小林一茶不要打哪，蒼蠅搓牠的手，搓他的脚呢。的詩句了。</p>
<p>於是我們買了許多的蒼蠅后了，全家下了總動員令，反一切大小蒼蠅來撲殺，說也奇怪，那蒼蠅像是拍不完似的，撲殺了一羣，又飛來了一羣，牠們鑽營不倦的精神有時也委實使我們嘆服。有時我們望着遍地的蠅屍，四溢的漿液·我們却一此也不會覺其殘忍，只是想着這漿液含有着我們的血和汗，又禁不住一陣痛心，一陣忿恨。</p>
<p>啊！蒼蠅！你這沒靈魂沒志氣的東西！人家厭你，你也不管，人家恨你，你也不知道！你這勢利沒廉恥的東西！一看見東面有甜的，你就營營地飛到東面；一看見西面有甜的，你就向西面鑽營！你這陰險沒良心東西！你刮了人家的血，吸了人家的汗，吮飽了人家的脂膏，你却還要將破壤生命的毒液傳輸給人家！</p>
<p>啊，最勢利最陰險最沒靈魂，沒良心，沒廉恥的惹東西啊，眼見得天氣凉了起來，看你橫行到幾時呢！</p>

<p>我想你或者可以將從前那些都抵賴了的，你可以說我們並沒有同行過，你也並沒有帮助過我，是的，你會將那些都推翻得乾乾凈凈，祇留下一個我生流着絶望白涙：留下一個你在遙遠地，遙遠地······</p>
<p>然而你所給予我的影響，我是永久不會忘記的！是你邦着我　衝出那樊籠，是你領着我走上所謂人生的路。這是多麽傷心的事呀，你把我放在這麽空得像死亡之國的半途上，你獨自個走了！</p>

<p>— 編者</p>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我是一個意志薄弱的靑年，民國二十一年高小畢業後，那時我還只有拾五歲，就失學在家，因爲經濟困難，所以不能繼續讀書。後經我舅父荐到滬西曹家渡增裕新烟店内學徒，在店裹往往受各種言語，眞是呌人難受。要想不做，又怕家長不允，只得糊塗的過去，光陰如箭，日月如梭，到現在不學已有二年多了。經理時常和我作對，前兩星期間，見我用的牙膏，就說是我偷錢賣的。這句話眞把我嚇得魂飛天外了。他有心害入，使我做也不好不做也不好，主意不定，心想還是自盡了罷。但先生或詐有妥當辦法，故請先生給我一個切實的答復。</p>
<p>敬祝</p>
<p>平安　　吳大德鞠躬</p>
<p>答：學徒受老閶的氣，這種事情是很平常的，爲了這事就要自盡，眞反自已的生命看得太不値價了。</p>
<p>我覺得，你現在的問題，倒不是「不做」「糢塗的過去，」而是以後對於老閶這種無端的侮辱和寃枉採取什麽樣的態度。你現在負氣『不做，』於他毫無損失或許還要說你做賊心虚無臉再握下去了，而你自已却白白的受了失業的痛苦和家長的白眼。這又何苦來呢。假如在當時，他說你用的牙膏是「偷錢去買的」的時候，你是應該抱着犧牲的精神，去責問他，一點不可馬虎，你應該問他：「何以見得我買牙膏是偷你的錢，難道我不偷錢自已就買不成嗎？「你説我偷錢，有什麽證據？」這此問題要呌他澈底的具體的答覆你。這樣，卽使他惱羞成怒，把你撤退，你也是很値得，這種「不做」纔是光明磊落。反之，當時含糊了過去，那他也許眞的欵心是你偷了錢，不久也許將你辭掉，就是不辭掉，你做賊的罪名也是肯定了。爲了前者而被撤退，你的家長和朋友頂多批評你皮氣壤，爲了後者而被辭，名譽就不大好聽，辯解也不易使人見信，你的信用就受了莫大的損失了。所以你過到經理有對你無理壓迫的時候，你應該立刻提出抗議。不過在現在這個社會，老板雖不能拿「理由」來壓倒你，却可用「失業」來屈服你，所以他們敢於不購道理，隨意壓迫。我上述的辦法不過是針對着保持個人的人格，及應付日常的環境而言，若說做學徒的要求眞正的能够得到解放，那就非把自已投身於廣大羣衆要求整個的攺逪社會運動不可，祇有在這個運動裹你的生活，自由纔能得到澈底的解救，所以，你的努力方向應分兩種，一主面旣需防禦老閶無理的歉壓，另一方面更須爲着求得自身的積極的解放面奮鬥。</p>

<p>— 保加利亞　伊凡·瓦卓夫作　楊森譯</p>
<p>那年秋天一次奇異的大霧降在威特倫市上。天氣潮濕，冰冷，不斷地落着連綿的細雨。好像是那整個的天空要融化成冰水，而澆在那付市的低低的屋頂上。在陰　泥濘的街心裹，總是嚮着嘈雜的聲音。瘦馬拉着的馬車，堆集着無數軍用品的牛車，農夫牽着他們的馬匹，牲畜，都塡滿在街上。在這樣紛亂之間，一隊新兵的行列嘈雜地前進着，有的穿着軍衣，有的空着皮朝外的羊皮衣，最多的人身上是裹着破爛毡毯，眼前當作防水布用。在他們胸上園着了　帶，肩上掛槍，飾着一束黃楊木，架着那裝得過滿的食糧袋。這些善良的靑年們，差不多快凍凝固了：泥濘浸到他們的膝上，雨雪擊打着他們的臉，但他們還是照樣地唱着。</p>
<p>在一家酒館的門首，站着一羣軍官，旅人和農夫，好奇地凝視着這些泥濘中的英雄。</p>
<p>在村鎭的廣塲上聚集着一羣婦入，女兒和孩子，衣服穿得狠壤，顫抖着。凍得麻木。他們是在等候着威特倫市的兵士，那些兵士是同着他們的聨隊從哈曼利開援，争進到蘇非亞去，其後再轉運到前綫。</p>
<p>「啊，喬治的兒了在那裹！祝福你，慈威特宼！」</p>
<p>「我看見他了······朗魁爾剛剛過去。」</p>
<p>「那是奈德金！約翰，你的母親在這兒！」</p>
<p>「花來迅速地遞過去，涙流在詐多人的頰上，話語一半呑在肚裹······軍樂隊正走過來，事竇上已經走過去了。</p>
<p>「媽媽，」一個紅頰的小女兒大呌着，」大哥哥在這兒！」</p>
<p>「斯託楊哥哥！」這次輪到一個七歲大的孩了呌起來：他正丫在那個女兒的身旁，他的臂指着兵士們。</p>
<p>「我的兒了，我的兒了！」那母親悲切地呻吟着。</p>
<p>一個身材高大有兩雙黑眼睛的漂亮的靑年，暫時離開了行列，吻着他母親的手，又吻着他的妹妹和小弟弟的前額，他的胸上綴着一個少女贈給他的一束花，化的佐耳邊又紥着另一束花，於是他又啊着，加進了隊伍一同前進。</p>

<p>— 麥浪</p>
<p>「田野風月」觀後感</p>
<p>對於電影作家處理農村題村題材的態度問題，早有了一此很想一吐爲快的見解。看了Ａｌｆｒｅｄ　Ｇｒｅｅｎ的名作「田村風月」（As　ｔｈｅ　Ｅａｒｔｈ　Ｔｕｒｎｓ）之後，這衝動重新熾烈起來。</p>
<p>中外的農村電影作家，好像都有一種共同的素樸的觀念，他們將農村看做一種和惡俗的都市對位的地存在着的理想的樂園，在他們所描寫的農村裹面，有的是强烈煌士香，靑葱的花木，樸質的鄕民，純情的愛戀。換句話講，他們將早已殘破了的農村，理想化做美麗的，被都市壓榨出來的人們的鳥托邦似的出路。都市是齷齪的，罪惡的，所以應該回到純潔而靜謐的鄕村裹去，「城市之夜』如此，「時代的進展」及其他也是一樣。</p>
<p>對於璨在的農村已非樂土之點，早已經有了許多人的指摘，但是將農村看作和『罪惡的都市」對立的天國一般純潔的那種幻覺，還是强有力地留存在許多劇作者和影評的觀念裹面。我們知道，現代的大都市並不是合理而健全的社會的產物，現行着的產業和經濟制度，像磁石吸引鐵悄一般的將多數的人口，吸收進畸形的都市裹面。在現代，都市是商業和工業的中心，是交通和文化的樞紐。換句話講，都市是爲着若干人的享受而需是着多數人的勞働力的所在。他吸收了農村的人口，使整個社會機構變成了腹部膨脹而手足枯枯瘦的變象。可是，在這膨脹了的都市中間，相互的生活條件並沒有可以攺善的方案。於是因爲大多數人密集在人口稠密的地方，而形成了劇烈的生存競爭爭的塲所。失業，饖餓，食苦，疾病，結婚的困難，性德的頽廢，爭鬥，虐殺······這纔造成了一種人間地獄一般的黑暗的都市的一面。所以明的地說，罪惡和純樸，黑暗和光明，决不是都市和農材固有的特徵，而祗是一種社會體制所造成的一時的病態的現象。罪惡的原因不在都市的本身，而在使都市和農村對立起來的社會體系。同樣地要消滅這一切罪惡和黑暗，方法也不在「回向農村」，而在消滅使這兩者對立的根本。「田野風月」的原作者將都市和田園寫成代表惡與善的兩個極端，（寫Ｊｅｎ的恬淡與純眞，Ｄｏｒｉｓ的浮華與淫蕩，都是作者對於都市與農村之觀念的表象），用牧歌情調的田園畫的筆觸，來描畫了素樸的人們的對於土地的執着，這祇表示了作者不能深刻地看出現社會都鄙對立的根本的原因，祗因單純地不滿於都市的不合理與黑暗，而反動的流露了對於理想化了的田園的憧憬。對於明天沒有明確的透視，詩人們是往往會從昨日去尋找安慰的。從空想到科學，從空漠的幻想到眞實的攺這，在處理農村題材的時候。這理解的階段是必須跨過的。</p>
<p>社會體制的攺變，和因爲這種攺變而引起的入口的分散，這纔是根本的消滅農村與都市之對立的方法。凝視現實！世界上不是已經有了六分之一的實例了嗎？</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c307">評“爲誰犧牲” <a href="#c307" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e307" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">307</a></h3>
<p>— —中央映　凌鶴</p>
<p>雖然在這劇本中，劇作者包含了許多技巧的缺點，以至於不正確的傾向，但是在這不准侈談抗日的現在，在通車通郵，乃至於所謂經濟互惠的現在，我們能看到這多少反映了義勇軍之英勇的戰鬥的影片，無論如何，是値得興奮的。因此，更可以證明；我們的民氣並未消沉，假使一有機會，被遏止着的積怨總會爆發起來的。誰說電影從業員祗是在糊裹糊塗的生活着而不會覺醒着爲民族利益而奮鬥？從來不很注意到影片内容的小公司出品，現在不也是很勇敢的擔負了自身之使命嗎？</p>
<p>但是劇作者是沒有抓住嚴正之主題的，雖然他開頭和結尾都寫了義勇軍之戰鬥，可是因爲他要使那女間牒給觀衆同情的原故，使她爲戀愛而犧牲，結果戀愛至上主義的氣氛十分濃厚，而且淆亂了劇的主題，這種損失亦不小吧？</p>
<p>關於這一點，一方面我們理解劇作者在不准反帝的環境之下，而不得不以戀愛代替了抗日的份量，而另一方面，在創作技巧上說，使那問牒爲觀衆乃是完全沒有必要的，假使就照故事的進展來說的話。不錯，我們承認一個認識不足的女了，在某種情形之下，她可以爲敵人担當間牒，而同時當她覺悟了以後，當她知道了自身之職責以後，她可以立刻反正過來。但是劇作者沒有注意到這一點，他將她寫成戀愛至上主義者，她的轉變祗是爲了愛情，這非現實的人物，乃是劇作者庸俗之處，那末就照這樣說，那個女間牒始終是不會覺悟的，又何妨索性將她寫成充分的壤女人？所以後面的轉變，根本是用不着的。</p>
<p>於是這一個女人，根本就是不倫不類的現實的人物，再加上導演的手法不甚高明，又加上黃曼梨不能飾這一類個性的反派角色，以致於整個的劇爲之失敗。他一方面如說編劇者是爲了要劇情曲折，使王參謀突然出獄，乃至於女間牒的自首，那種方法也是非常恶劣的。因爲卽使要劇情曲折也得在情理之中。</p>
<p>不，這些乃是導演要負其絶大責任的，假使導演者眞正能擔負起他的任務的話，那末相當成問題的劇本，導演要對觀衆負責而使其百分之百的優良。導演手法顯然是趕不上編劇手法的，我們看罷，除了張翼飾的角色比較的有點眞實性之外，其餘諸人，都弄得不倫不類。那些角色因然都不息樣有做戲的天才，然而主要的是導演不懂得怎樣去發揮演員的個性。譬如說陳雁從來多做反面人物的，面這裹却使她不當笑而笑要哭時又哭不出來。黃曼梨從來就是怯懦型的，這在歸宿中可得着充分的證明，而在這裹却要她做一個誘惑性的蕩婦，結果在無靈魂的人物身上裝上了苦笑，再加上導演不知道劇情之弛緊，不懂得調子在劇中的重要，於是間牒所應當的機警或敏捷的動作在黃曼梨身上一點也找不出來。他如導演自已扮裝的吕隊長，也不見高明。祗有張翼略見出色一點。　　此外，些地方如遠景中間夾入中景，不能接好，不能抓信高潮等等。而噱頭也是很生硬的。其他從略。</p>

<p>廣吿列入文學卓越獎之一，始於美國觀察雜誌ＡｍｅｒｉｃａｎＳｐｅｃｔａｔｏｒ該雜誌每年年頒給文學卓越獎一共六種：訪問記，諷刺畫，小說，小品文，戲劇，與廣吿。該雜誌編輯的人都是當代美國文學家，如美國戲劇作家與尼爾，小說家安迪生諸氏等。</p>
<p>今年春間該報編輯人把全美國一年來香烟，汽車，服裝，出版界，舞臺劇等所登廣吿來佔評優劣，結果就以電影廣吿爲爲最佳，而電影廣吿中特别指出『壽頭勿壽腦』Ｐａｌｏｏｋａ（南就戲院不日映）爲代表作。該片主演者爲傑美杜倫，羅范麗，史都華歐文，是一張以滑稽爲題材的片了。</p>
<p>『壽頭勿壽腦』廣吿揭發點完全集中於男主角祁美杜倫一人身上，像如一銀幕新發現的美人，近代最富音樂天性的鋼琴大家』等名詞，另外廣吿樣子上特聘美國第一流漫畫家史格氏以諷刺筆法描寫男主角怎樣的『美人』『鋼琴大家』等，使讀讀者看了便引起他們的興趣心理，必以一看『美人』『鋼琴大家』爲快，這就是該片子廣吿的效力了。</p>
<p>當該片廣吿被選爲最佳的消息佈吿之後，有五位報紙編輯也自認爲該廣吿所吸引而去看那張片子的，他們都表示滿意。將來『壽頭勿壽腦』在本埠開映時，我们一定有機會來鑒賞這個最佳的電影廣吿了。</p>

<p>說起梅蕙絲，那一個人不不爲她所吸引？當你讀了下面的新聞，將更驚嘆她的魔力不止吧！</p>
<p>據美國波士頓通訊，該地某大戲院最近在開映影片時，發生火災了　可是院中六百多個觀衆，不要說離座逃命，就是連動身體的人亦沒有呀！這是什麽理由呢？聽說該戲院那天正放映着梅蕙絲的影片！</p>
<p>我不能够擔保這條新聞確是眞實的。可是如這是眞實的話，那麽梅蕙絲這女人，眞是個了不得的人物呀！</p>

<p>連映月餘之『漁光曲』，其中感人最深的，要算是那令哀婉動人的瀂光曲歌詞吧？但是能直接的毫無折扣的將那首歌詞很淸晰的送到觀衆的耳朶裹的，那却是不能不歸功於電通公司之三友式錄音機的配音了。惟聞之電通公司人云，『漁光曲』配音，僅爲電通𨦟芒初試之作�尙未能視爲標凖作。現該公司又經多日之深切研究，收音方面，愈臻完善。現除以一部錄音機運至香港環球公司工作外，另設製片廠於本埠斜土路，專攝有聲影片。其第一部全部對白，歌唱聲片『桃李刧』，現已攝成全片三分之一。約於中秋月圓時，當可供獻於影迷之前矣。（却酬）</p>

<p>Chaiyama Arrives in Changchun, Telegraphs Yin Tong to Go. Japanese Side to First Decide on Negotiation Principles. Formal Talks to be Held in Tianjin. (Tianjin) Tao Shangming will go to Changchun on the 18th to negotiate on war zone issues with the Japanese Kwantung Army Headquarters. He is scheduled to return to Ping [Beiping] within a week to report. Tao's trip was pre-arranged with Chaiyama Igo and was approved by both of them at the Kwantung Army Headquarters before he proceeded. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chaiyama went to Changchun to meet with Hishikari Takashi to ask for instructions on the negotiation policy for the war zone. It is reported that the Japanese side plans to decide on the principles of the war zone issue only in Changchun, and the detailed items will still be negotiated concretely in Tianjin in the future. The so-called negotiation principle is that the Japanese side still insists that our side should acknowledge and strictly prohibit any anti-Japanese activities in North China. How our side will respond in the future is under consideration. After Chaiyama arrived in Changchun, he telegraphed Yin Tong in Moganshan, urging him to go north to Changchun immediately for joint discussions. It is reported that Lei Shourong, a counselor of the Political Readjustment Council, will also go to Changchun in the next few days to participate in the war zone issue negotiations. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the abolition of the Tanggu War Zone Agreement, Huang Fu summoned Xiong Bin, the director of the Military Affairs Committee, to Moganshan for discussions. Xiong then went north to preside over the negotiations because Xiong was the chief representative of the Tanggu Agreement. After Xiong arrived in Ping [Beiping], the Kwantung Army will also send a responsible representative to Ping [Beiping]. Chaiyama telegraphed the Japanese Embassy today to report that he has arrived in Changchun and is currently consulting with Okamura Yasuji, the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, to resolve war zone matters. He is scheduled to leave Changchun on the 21st and arrive on the morning of the 23rd via the Ping-Shen through train. After Chaiyama returns to Ping [Beiping], he will convene a war zone conference, where both Chinese and Japanese personnel will formally propose solutions to all issues. Okamura, the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, is also expected to come to Ping [Beiping] at the end of the month for investigation. (19th Dispatch) (Hangzhou) Yin Tong left Moganshan at 2:00 PM today and took a car around 3:00 PM to Hangzhou, where he boarded the 5:55 PM night express train to Shanghai to discuss the overall situation in North China with Tang Youren, and then head north. According to reports, Huang's attitude is very negative. If there is no solution to the North China issue, Huang is afraid that he will be unable to resume his position. (19th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Ping [Beiping] Military Branch</p>
<h3 id="e2">Did Not Send Personnel Beyond the Border <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Reports in Japanese and Puppet Newspapers Are Inaccurate (Beiping) Recently, Japanese newspapers in Tianjin and puppet state newspapers published in Dalian have often published inaccurate news. For example, the Japanese Tianjin Daily and Jingjin Daily News on June 29th published a news item stating that the Ping [Beiping] Military Branch sent staff officer Liu Depei beyond the border to carry out anti-Manchu work. Also, the Manchuria Daily, published in Dalian on the 14th of this month, published a news item stating that Huang Tiansheng, the chief advisor of the advisory department of the Ping [Beiping] Military Affairs Branch, and others entered Manchuria to investigate military affairs and began to organize a secret intelligence network. After inquiring with a certain person in the Military Affairs Branch about whether this was the case, the reporter of this newspaper received a responsible reply stating that the Military Affairs Branch had not only never dispatched such personnel, but also had no so-called advisory department. As for who Liu Depei and Huang Tiansheng are, such names have never been seen among the branch's staff. The contents of the Japanese and puppet newspapers are indeed inaccurate, and this is specially disclosed here to prove the unfounded rumors of the puppet newspapers.

<p>(Tianjin) Due to the influx of rising water from various rivers in the upper reaches of the Hai River, siltation is becoming increasingly severe. The river surface near the International Bridge is 400 feet wide, with 160 feet of siltation. The wharf in the Japanese Concession is 40 feet silted up. Large ships with a draft of more than 5 feet cannot enter the port. The Hai River Management Committee is making great efforts to investigate the Qujia Dian Dam of the Yong River in the upper reaches to allow silt to be transported away and clear water to enter the Hai River. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Yongding River has experienced a submerged flood, with the water level rising five times to a height of 18 Chinese feet, exceeding last year's highest water level by two feet, which is extremely dangerous.

The Ping-Gu long-distance bus only reaches the west bank of the Baihe River outside the west gate of Miyun. The traffic between Miyun and Gubeikou is particularly difficult due to the overlapping mountains and overflowing streams. The terrain of Sanhe County is low-lying, and there are many rivers within its borders. At present, low-lying areas have become swamps, and rivers near the coast have been washed away, causing severe damage.

<p>(Beiping) After traffic on the Ping-Sui Railway was interrupted by the water, the stations of Fushengzhuang and Sandaoying were all submerged in water, and most of the roadbed collapsed. Although the water level has gradually receded in recent days, it is still difficult for vehicles to pass.

<p>(Tokyo) A reporter from a certain news agency visited President Wang on the 19th to inquire about his opinion on the statement issued by the Control Yuan. Wang then issued his statement in writing. The meaning of his remarks in Shanghai a few days ago was clear, and he did not want to make any further elaborations. In short, today is still a period of political tutelage, and all power is concentrated in the Party. No organization can be independent of the Party and disobey the Party's guidance and supervision. Although the Control Yuan has a guarantee law, if its members are also Party members, the Party's disciplinary sanctions can still be imposed on them. He hoped that they would be cautious in their speeches. (19th Dispatch)</p>

After An Qin Dingji, the representative of the welcoming Panchen Lama from Tibet, arrived in mainland China, a telegram from Lhasa stated that two representatives from the three major monasteries in Tibet and one representative from the Tibetan government are also on their way and will meet with the Panchen Lama in Qinghai to present everything in person. The situation in Tibet is very good, and all parties are very eager to welcome the Panchen Lama back to Tibet. However, if the Panchen Lama returns to Tibet in winter and enters Tibet from Qinghai, there will be great difficulties regarding the fodder for the camels and horses used. Therefore, it is best to do so in late spring or early summer. (19th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Wang Jingwei Sent Cao Jingyuan to Deliver a Letter of Greeting</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Duan Qirui was invited by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Xiong Shihui to Lushan to escape the summer heat. On the evening of the 17th, he, along with Wu Guangxin, Liang Hongzhi, and Duan Hongwang, and others, boarded the Longhe ship in Shanghai and went west to Xunyang, and then to Lushan. The ship arrived in Nanjing at 2:30 AM on the 19th. Many of Duan's relatives and friends in Nanjing went to Xiaguan to greet him. President Wang also sent Cao Jingyuan, a counselor of the Executive Yuan, to deliver a handwritten letter to the dock and provide all assistance. After the ship docked at the Yihe Wharf, those who came to greet him boarded the ship one after another to inquire. Counselor Cao also personally handed over President Wang's handwritten letter of greeting to Duan. Duan briefly talked with those who came to greet him on the ship and did not disembark. The ship then left Nanjing at about 8:00 AM and sailed to Xunyang. According to what Duan told the Central News Agency reporter on the ship, he is already 71 years old. Since recovering from his stomach ailment last year, his health has gradually improved. He spends his days in Shanghai playing chess with various chess friends for five or six games. This time, he was invited by Chairman Chiang and Chairman Xiong of Jiangxi Province, so he went to Lushan from Shanghai to escape the summer heat. He will return to Shanghai for recuperation after it cools down in the fall. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Duan Qirui, who was invited to Lushan to escape the summer heat by Chairman Chiang, passed through Nanjing to the west on the 19th. A reporter boarded the Longhe ship to submit his name card to request an audience. First, his nephew, Supervisory Committee member Duan Hongwang, received him and told him to wait a moment. Then, Cao Jingyuan, the representative of the President of the Executive Yuan, boarded the ship with Wang's handwritten letter to inquire. After a short while, Duan personally came out to the living room. During the meeting, Cao Jingyuan first stepped forward to present Wang's letter and explained that President Wang originally wanted to come to pay his respects in person, but he was attending the Central Standing Committee meeting at this moment, so he could not spare himself, and he felt very sorry. After finishing speaking, Duan immediately opened Wang's letter and expressed his gratitude. Then, he talked to Cao about his life in Shanghai in recent years and inquired about President Wang's recent political situation. Duan was full of energy and had no signs of aging. After finishing talking with Cao, he then received the reporter and said that he had been living a secluded life in Shanghai. He is already seventy years old, and his energy is declining. For a year last year, he was unable to eat a single meal due to discomfort in his body. His appetite has increased greatly this spring, and he can finish two bowls of rice at each meal. Recently, it has been hot, and his appetite has been halved. Chiang Kai-shek has repeatedly telegraphed me to go to Kuling to escape the summer heat, saying that the climate there is cool and suitable for the elderly to spend the summer. Since I have never set foot on Kuling in my life, I will take this opportunity to go and see the true face of Lushan. I plan to stay for two months and return to Shanghai after it cools down in the fall. The reporter asked if he was used to living in Shanghai. Duan replied that he was used to everything.

<p>Postponement</p>
<p>For several months, the situation in eastern Chahar has been relatively stable. Recently, there has been a sudden trend towards tension. For example, the Japanese Chengde Conference resolved to increase troops on the Great Wall defense line, Mr. Doihara is lobbying the Xilin Gol leagues' princes, and the Ujimqin tribe of the Xue League gifted fine horses to the puppet Manchuria. Mr. Song Zheyuan sent an urgent telegram to the central government. All kinds of news are sufficient as clear evidence.</p>
<p>For the sake of facilitating aggression, the Japanese have already divided the three northeastern provinces into southern and northern Manchuria. They have also divided Inner Mongolia into puppet eastern and western Mongolia. The so-called Eastern Mongolia refers to a part of Rehe and Liaoning. After the September 18th Incident, the Japanese forcibly placed them under the puppet Manchuria's</p>
<p>territory, while controlling its actual power. Today's Western Mongolia only contains the three leagues of Xilin Gol, Chahar, and Suiyuan. It is also being instigated by the Japanese through a small number of local princes, using the beautiful name of "high degree of autonomy" to form an actual split. The Japanese have coveted Manchuria and Mongolia for decades. After gaining Manchuria, seizing Mongolia became easier. Now that Eastern Mongolia has been included, how could they be willing to give up the great Western Mongolia? However, the Japanese are planning for the worst. If their plan can fulfill their long-cherished wish through means of coercion and inducement, then they would not want to waste manpower and money to deplete their strength for the war against Russia. Generally speaking, the Japanese plan for the future is: the first step is to make Western Mongolia and puppet Manchuria cooperate; the second step is to use the power of puppet Manchuria to promote the merger of eastern and western Mongolia, in order to organize the "Great Mongolian Republic" mentioned in the Tanaka Memorial; the third step is to conclude a treaty similar to the "Manchuria-Mongolia Agreement," turning the "Great Mongolian Republic" into a vassal of puppet Manchuria. Their relationship may be the same as that of puppet Manchuria and Japan today. Finally, puppets such as Pu Yi will copy the story of the Japan-Korea annexation, "presenting" the "Manchukuo" to the Japanese Emperor, and the sovereignty of all of Mongolia will also be transferred to the east.</p>
<p>The Japanese have already set their steps, but they are still considering carefully, not wanting to act too hastily. This is not out of fear of China's resistance or Western Mongolia's struggle, but only for the sake of preparing completely for the war against Russia. Because once the Japanese invade Chahar and Suiyuan, directly heading towards Outer Mongolia, then the land of Siberia east of Lake Baikal can all be taken by the Japanese. Therefore, the Russians are paying unusual attention to the actions of the Japanese army in the eastern Chahar area. Molotov, the chairman of the Soviet Union's Military Commission, secretly sent senior staff and many experts to Inner Mongolia to conduct on-the-ground inspections in various leagues to devise countermeasures, which shows a glimpse of their emphasis. It is expected that if Japan succeeds in invading Western Mongolia, the opportunity for a Japanese-Russian war will become more ripe. If they further advance to occupy Outer Mongolia, then war</p>
<h3 id="e33">'s outbreak is almost imminent. <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Although some people, based on military transportation reasons, determine that the Japanese General Staff will definitely not attack the Soviet Union via Outer Mongolia, the Japanese are actively building left-wing artillery platforms, fortresses, radio stations, airfields, railways, highways, and other military facilities along the Great Wall and in the eastern Chahar area, which cannot be said to be without purpose. According to our observation, the Japanese plan for war against Russia is not limited to one corner, but the eastern Chahar area is indeed one of its focal points of attention. Judging by common sense, the Japanese military action in this area will likely take the form of a pair of scissors. In other words, taking Dolon as the center, they will divide their forces into north and south. One route will advance northwest along the Dolon-Kulun route, hoping to encompass the Xilin Gol League and occupy all of Western Mongolia. Then, passing through places like Subei Jiang in the Xilin Gol League, they will directly approach Urd, a transportation hub in the Chechen Khanate of Outer Mongolia. Once the Japanese army reaches here, it can cut off Sino-Russian transportation and threaten Siberia. The other route will develop southward along the Zhan-Yuan 24 districts, sweeping north of the Yellow River.</p>
<p>The Japanese aim is here, even if it doesn't hit the mark, it's not far off. Recent news says that the difficult situation in eastern Chahar will arrive this autumn, which is not an overestimation. However, apart from sending Mr. Liu Shouzhong to inspect, nothing has been heard of the central government's response policy. I believe that Generals Chahar Song, Suiyuan Fu, Shanxi Xu, and others are all people with nationalistic ideas among today's military personnel. In this critical situation, the central government must have a way to fulfill their ambition to defend the territory. Even in the Mongolian Autonomous Political Affairs Committee, there is no lack of people who understand the big picture, are devoted to public service, and love the country. Now that the committee has requested the central government to assist in military preparations to strengthen defense, the central government, for the sake of carrying out its original intention to support Inner Mongolian autonomy, must also try to comply with its request.</p>

It is currently considering the following policy changes: (1) For countries that refuse to recognize "Manchukuo," if they request the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to act as an intermediary for their diplomatic affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will notify the "Manchukuo" Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the name of that country; (2) In the future, such countries, if they appoint consular representatives, must first obtain the permission of the "Manchu" government. Currently, they only notify the "Manchu" authorities; (3) Engage in reforming the "Manchukuo" judicial system, improving prisons, and formulating laws for the management of foreigners, so as to abolish consular jurisdiction in the future; (4) Revise the principle of equal opportunity for opening doors in "Manchukuo" to allow internal interests to obtain greater protection.

<p>Emphasizing the Defense of Alaska, Intending to Hold Joint Exercises in the Waters of That Area (Washington) With preliminary naval talks in London at a standstill and the Japanese Navy demanding complete freedom from treaty constraints, U.S. Secretary of the Navy Swanson today reiterated the government's "superiority" naval construction plan. Secretary Swanson stated that the U.S. Navy can complete the limits permitted by the treaty in 1939. Swanson said, "I have previously insisted that within the treaty framework, we should have a navy no less than any other country. Now, I particularly feel that there is no reason to change this claim." It is said that the naval air power still needs to be greatly increased. A large-scale aircraft construction plan has been approved and will soon begin construction. (18th National Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. Associated Press learned today that senior officials in the Navy and the Department of the Navy are currently considering holding a 1935 naval exercise near the Aleutian Islands of Alaska. This matter is quite important because the U.S. government is planning to open a naval port in Dutch Harbor as the first naval base in Alaska. The current state of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands is indefensible in the event of an enemy attack. However, in the event of war, the Eastern Fleet can use this place as an offensive base during the summer. Therefore, the U.S. Navy has been paying close attention to the far north in the past two days. When the American fleet sailed to the east coast with great fanfare, a transport ship and a submarine quietly sailed out of San Francisco and went to Alaska. The naval and land-based air forces are currently conducting formation flights to Dutch Harbor, Alaska. Twelve naval aircraft have flown from San Diego to Dutch Harbor. (18th National Telegraph)</p>

<p>(Moscow) The Soviet Russian government held a national propaganda campaign today to guide the people in defending against poison gas in preparation for war. Pictures are posted everywhere in Moscow, illustrating how to wear gas masks. The Aviation Chemical Defense Association uses its factories and school branches to make the whole of Russia aware of poison gas. Some factories even have "gas exercises" so that workers can quickly avoid danger without causing chaos. Residents of Moscow must build shelters against poison gas in their homes. All government buildings have already been equipped with this equipment. It is said that the newly built underground passages in Moscow are also built for anti-gas purposes. At the same time, the government is not ignoring plans to use poison gas to attack the enemy. Some factories and test laboratories that foreigners cannot access are busy manufacturing poison gas.

<p>Increasing to 1,300 Aircraft Within Five Years (London) It is heard that the Cabinet has finally approved the British Air Force expansion program today. This is one of the main results of the failure of the disarmament conference to reach a proper agreement on arms restrictions. It is now believed that the British Air Force will increase by about 50 squadrons, or 600 aircraft, within a few years. According to the Royal Air Force, there are currently 890 first-class aircraft. If those planned to be added this fiscal year are included, there are a total of 910 aircraft. (18th Reuters dispatch) (London) The air force expansion program finally approved by the Cabinet stipulates an increase of 41 squadrons, or 492 aircraft. When the House of Commons met today, Deputy Prime Minister Baldwin declared that the government had decided to make the British Air Force equal to those of its neighbors in the next few years. The government knows that this move cannot be delayed any longer, so it has decided to expand the air force's five-year program, adding 41 squadrons, of which 33 squadrons will join the domestic defense, so that the number of domestic aircraft will increase from the current 42 squadrons to 75 squadrons. The remaining new squadrons will be assigned to the fleet or sent to defense positions abroad. The situation will be constantly monitored, and the government reserves the right to modify its program at any time depending on the situation. The Royal Air Force currently has 890 first-class aircraft. (19th Reuters dispatch) Naval Conference</p>

Foreign Minister Simon replied that, as far as he knew, the conference did not propose to discuss other issues besides naval issues. Subsequently, Acting Prime Minister Baldwin answered another member's question, saying that communication with other parts of the British Empire regarding the conference was still proceeding in the usual way. He also said that the government would seek appropriate opportunities to discuss everything with representatives from various parts of the Empire before the conference is held to supplement the written documents.

<p>Japanese Representative to Go to Washington Early Next Month (Washington) Several Japanese representatives will come here next month to prepare for consultations on the 1935 naval disarmament negotiations in the form of private talks. According to U.S. sources, Japan's intentions can be divided into the following three points: (1) Regarding the respective positions and goals of Japan and the United States in the Pacific, it is proposed to establish a new agreement, which will also be promoted in the future to the United Kingdom; (2) Japan intends to make the United States recognize the increase in naval power to above the original ratio of 5:5:3; (3) Japan has always had a plan to conclude a mutual non-aggression pact with the United States, and is now trying to make it mature. The United States is still reluctant to hear about this plan because what the United States hopes for is to conclude a general non-aggression treaty, not a bilateral non-aggression treaty.

<p>Saito Presents Two Proposals to Osumi (Tokyo) Ambassador Saito went to the Navy Ministry at 2:30 p.m. on the 19th. He happened to meet the Chief of the Naval General Staff, Prince Fushimi, who was present, and immediately paid a visit. He mentioned the circumstances of being ordered to return to China, and explained the experiences and various situations during his six months in the United States. In particular, he reported in detail on the atmosphere of the U.S. government and public, and the intentions of the naval authorities regarding the naval conference next year. He also answered all the questions asked by the Chief of Staff. Next, he met with Navy Minister Osumi and talked for a long time, reporting on the political, economic, and diplomatic conditions of the United States. He contributed to the attitude and strategy that the Japanese government should take in the upcoming disarmament conference. According to the talks, it goes like this:</p>
<p>"The U.S. government has adopted a relatively cold attitude toward Japan's request for equal rights in armaments and its proposal to abolish the existing ratio. The naval authorities still insist on building the world's largest navy and must strive to ensure the current treaty. Therefore, Japan's demands will be in a difficult situation."</p>
<p>Based on concrete facts, the ambassador explained the situation of the naval conference in great detail. Next, Navy Minister Osumi explained the fundamental policies on disarmament that had been decided at the Navy's top-level cadre meeting, saying briefly that, we must strictly adhere to the following two articles: 1. Abolish the ratio system;</p>
<p>2. Countries with high armaments must exercise reasonable reduction. Ambassador Saito and Navy Minister Osumi exchanged views and completely agreed. From now on, the backbone of future Japanese-American naval work will be based on the fundamental policies of the Japanese Navy. It is heard that the ambassador will have to meet with the naval minister several more times before returning to his post. (19th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>(Geneva) Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov recently sent a letter to the Three-Member Committee of the League of Nations dealing with the Chaco dispute, stating that Soviet weapons and war materials are manufactured by the state, and private individuals are not allowed to operate them. Therefore, only the government needs to stop transporting arms to Paraguay and Bolivia, and there will be absolutely no arms leaving the Soviet Union to the two countries from within Soviet territory. (According to reports, in May of this year, British representative Eden proposed in Geneva to prohibit the supply of arms to the two South American countries of Paraguay and Bolivia. Subsequently, the League of Nations notified all countries of this intention and asked for their replies.) (18th Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>Kharbin Railway Workers' Club Ordered to Close, News from Bo Li (Khabarovsk) and Harbin: The Manchurian police are constantly destroying cultural and educational institutions on the Chinese Eastern Railway. So far, four of the Kharbin Chinese Eastern Railway workers' clubs (the largest cultural center in Manchuria, including the Harbin Railway Hall) have been closed. The Japanese and Manchurian newspapers first made preliminary provocative propaganda, falsely claiming that the railway workers' clubs were organs for various conspiracies, etc., which led to this action. On July 6, the anniversary of the Soviet Constitution, the police did not allow dramas to be performed in various clubs and dispersed the audiences gathered at the clubs. Finally, the Soviet Union's Consul-General to Manchuria, Slavutsky, made a strong application to the Manchurian side, and the order was cancelled that evening. On July 10, the same actions were repeated, the police again prohibited the clubs from performing dramas, and expelled the patrons in the summer gardens set up by the clubs. These actions have aroused public outrage among the residents of Kharbin, because the Chinese Eastern Railway clubs were originally the only cultural and recreational institutions for the railway workers and other residents of Kharbin.

<p>French Mega-Fraud Case</p>
<h3 id="e58">Tiddio's Testimony <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Asserting That Stavisky Should Bear All Responsibility　　Fearing It Will Cause Political Repercussions (Paris) Former Prime Minister and current Minister without Portfolio Tiddio testified before the Stavisky case parliamentary investigation committee, saying that at the beginning of the Stavisky case, some people in the authorities knew the details very well, but deliberately pretended not to know, these people made propaganda, intending to blame others, and thus slandered him (Tiddio), and there were check stubs (that is, the ticket stubs of Stavisky issuing checks to the political world) that were tampered with, but experts had stated that the handwriting of the check stubs was unrecognizable and proved that there must be tampering. Although he repeatedly requested to testify in court to explain the whole story, he was not summoned until today. Tiddio then said that he did not know Stavisky until January 1933, when he learned that the Volonté newspaper was controlled by him. Tiddio continued to say that the 17 members of parliament involved in the Stavisky case were not his (Tiddio's) friends. Tiddio also said that from the beginning of the case, former Prime Minister Chautemps knew everything, but he (Chautemps) tried to cover it up and used the method of shifting the line of sight to eliminate the case. Before September 1933, Chautemps had already known the details of the Stavisky case, although there were rumors outside at the time, Chautemps did not strictly order the arrest. Most of the Radical Socialist Party members helped Stavisky, and the prosecutor and the administrative organs were Stavisky's amulet. Former Minister of Labor Dalimier even helped Stavisky with an official letter (referring to the official letter of the Ministry of Labor, agreeing that the Social Insurance Bank should purchase the false bonds of Bayonne City). Chautemps served as Minister of the Interior and Prime Minister from June 1932 to January 1934. How could he know nothing about this case? Tiddio then proved that many of Chautemps' staff knew Stavisky well. The detective team had all the files on Stavisky, which were locked in a secret place by senior officials, and treated as national secrets. Tiddio then said that Chautemps used various means to make Stavisky free from legal sanctions, and Stavisky was able to escape on December 23 last year. After listening to Tiddio's statement, the investigation committee decided to hold a meeting at 9 pm to let Tiddio confront Chautemps. Tiddio's testimony made a deep impression on the investigation committee. Most members believed that Tiddio's declaration would not only have an impact on the work of the investigation committee, but also cause repercussions in the general political situation, because it would be enough to cause debates among various political parties. In the lounge of the House of Representatives, the public was quite moved by Tiddio's words. Radical Socialist and Socialist Party members disagreed with Tiddio's words, while Tiddio's friends expressed their approval. In short, Tiddio's testimony is likely to cause major political repercussions. (Havas News, 18th)</p>

Local governments must not establish additional taxes under other names. This was ordered by the Executive Yuan in December of the 19th year of the Republic of China and circulated for compliance. It is now reported by the Executive Yuan that although the previous prohibition order has been faithfully implemented by some provinces, there are also some who have disobeyed the order and continue to collect taxes as usual. This situation is enough to hinder the unification of national taxes. Senior military and political officials of each province should order their respective subordinate agencies and local groups to strictly abide by the previous order and never establish any additional taxes on salt. County magistrates should be responsible for supervising at any time and strictly preventing such practices, in order to emphasize national taxes and avoid divergences. This order.

According to reports, in the past, only the Bank of China and the Bank of Shanghai handled cooperative business in Shaanxi, most of which were loans.

According to statistics, in Lintong, Sanyuan, Jingyang, Xianyang, and other seven counties, more than 600,000 cotton products will be harvested and stored in warehouses, and then shipped to Shanghai by the Cotton Corporation for sale. When farmers have experience in transportation in the future, they will be handed over to them to take over. The sales situation of wheat in Shaanxi this year is quite good, but the weather is dry in summer, and the autumn harvest may be affected.

Because the farmland within the canal is irrigated, the crops are very good. It can be seen that the development of the Northwest should focus on water conservancy. (Central News Agency, 19th)</p>

<p>Using Yimin Company as a Cover, Company Stock Certificates Were Used to Appoint Fake Military Commanders, and All Have Been Arrested. Jinan Correspondence: Recently, some disillusioned military personnel secretly organized a large-scale counter-revolutionary organization in Shandong Province, appointing a large number of military division and brigade commanders, recruiting and organizing troops in various counties, intending to launch a major uprising. This was truly shocking. The special investigation team of the Military Law Department of the Third Route Army Headquarters cracked the case, and today (17th), they were escorted to the Military Law Department of the Third Route Army Headquarters for interrogation. The details of the process are described below:</p>
<p>Organizational Content: In June of this year, the Shandong authorities received a confidential report stating that some disillusioned military personnel were secretly working in the province, mobilizing troops, and intending to launch a major uprising. Liu Yaoting, the captain of the special investigation team of the Third Route Army Headquarters, immediately dispatched detectives to investigate in detail and attempted to infiltrate the organization in order to obtain evidence. They learned that these disillusioned military personnel did not use military titles on the surface and were operating under the name of Yimin Company. Everything was replaced with stocks, with 10,000 yuan worth of stock being the equivalent of a division commander, 5,000 yuan worth of stock being the equivalent of a brigade commander, and so on. The general manager on the stock certificates was You Renxiao, and the deputy manager was Huang Ziliang, who were the actual commander and deputy commander. They also appointed Shu Zhentang, who was accustomed to mobilizing troops, as the commander of the First Army. Below him were five divisions: Ren Buyuan, the commander of the First Division; Wang Zhongting, the commander of the Second Division; Liu Junming, the commander of the Third Division; Liu Yanbin, the commander of the Fourth Division; and Bu Hanzhang, the commander of the Fifth Division. Zhang Huchen was the commander of the First Brigade of the First Division; Wang Zhizhong was the commander of the Second Brigade; and Lü Xianbin was the commander of the Third Brigade. They were recruiting troops throughout the province, plotting a major uprising.</p>
<p>The Entire Case is Cracked: After the investigation team learned the content of the fake organization, they secretly investigated the location of its key personnel. On the 14th of this month, Shu Zhentang, the fake army commander, was arrested at No. 104 Wangguanzhuang near Xinzhuang. The fake Yimin Company stock certificates representing the appointment of Shu Zhentang as the Jinan manager and the appointment of Shu Zhentang as the lieutenant general commander of the First Army of the Third Route Army were found. The lists of names made by the division and brigade commanders and the submissions from the various divisions and brigades reporting the recruitment of troops were also found. Hou Zhenhuan, who was also involved in the activities and impersonating a military officer, was also arrested. Yue Dai, the commander of the First Brigade, and two suspects, Si Shizhai and Wang Fengwen, were arrested in Yuanliuzhuang, along with four stock certificates. Xie Guangsong, a relative of the deputy commander, was arrested in the Big Locust Tree area of Jinan and brought to the team headquarters. With the evidence in hand, they all confessed to the crimes. After the 1,000 witnesses and evidence were escorted to the Military Law Department on the 17th, it was reported that Han Fuju will personally interrogate them. The various fake documents seized are copied below:</p>

<p>Female Bandit Zhen Hui Surrenders and</p>
<h3 id="e102">Bitterly Narrates the Crimes of the Bandit Troops <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The True Face of Economic Bankruptcy is Fully Revealed. The National Army's Policy Change is a Fatal Blow.</p>
<p>Nanchang Communication: Military Information. The surrendered female bandit, Zhen Hui, described the ills of the Communist bandits in great detail. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Suicide Policy: The Communist bandits follow Lenin's theory and imitate Soviet Russia's strategy, but they implement it blindly and brutally without considering the facts. They also want to complete their tasks quickly using mechanized methods. On the outside, they still use the slogan of developing the national revolutionary war as a slogan, but inside the bandit areas, they are carrying out a proletarian dictatorship. Those who come from the so-called bourgeoisie and the majority of the petty bourgeoisie are not allowed to survive in the bandit areas. Even those who have a long history in a bandit party and have been responsible for important responsibilities are severely attacked. Or, under the pretext of errors in work or theory, they are killed without any politeness. According to his analysis, except for a very small number of farm laborers who are proletarians, most of the self-cultivating farmers are also regarded as petty bourgeoisie. Workers with slightly higher wages are said to be capitalist lackeys and aristocratic workers. Then, in China, which has a universal small-scale peasant economic organization and an undeveloped industry, if it is to be carried out under the policy of the Communist bandits, it can only be to kill all 400 million Chinese compatriots. This inhumane policy has already determined its natural demise in China's economic organization.</p>
<p>2. Contradiction of Labor Law: Generally, workers in the bandit areas must be subject to their labor laws. However, the labor laws in the bandit areas are completely a kind of legislation that treats employers harshly. For example, every boss who has 80 yuan of capital must be introduced to a worker by the Soviet to work for him. Both parties sign a contract. If it is a child laborer, the monthly wage must be 10 to 12 yuan, and they must often participate in Soviet meetings and work, and the wage is still paid. Within a month, they must not work for the boss for more than half a month. Therefore, the boss has no choice but to close the door, and the worker has no choice but to lose his job. Therefore, the herding workers in the bandit areas are all unemployed under the influence of their labor laws. On the other hand, the industry in the bandit areas cannot be developed. These are all contradictions that arise from their actions without considering the facts.</p>
<p>3. Economic Bankruptcy: The Communist bandits have been through the National Army's first, second, third, fourth, and fifth encirclement and suppression campaigns. Although they have not been completely eliminated,</p>
<p>However, the scope of the bandit areas is shrinking day by day. In addition to the blockade policy and the fierce war, the strong men in the bandit areas are all conscripted into the bandit army, and the productivity has been sharply reduced. The problem of economic materials has caused great panic. According to the pseudo-central statistics, the expenditure table of each bandit area must be at least one million or so per month. In the Xiang, E, and Gan bandit areas, the food allowance of two yuan per month per person cannot be issued. There is no way to intensify the guerrilla warfare, capture the local tyrants, and even peel off the skin of the local tyrants in the guerrilla area. They can only oppress the masses and sell public bonds. The public bonds have already been issued for four periods. The masses have already received a piece of worthless paper several times and are unwilling to be fooled again. Therefore, the economic crisis in the bandit areas is deepening day by day. 4. The Mask of Deception is Unveiled: The Communist bandits have always used the trick of deceiving the masses with the issue of political power and land, in order to seize the masses as a way to fight for their sphere of influence and die. But in fact, because their entire economic problem cannot be solved, the nameless exploitation of the masses is beyond description. What progressive tax, mutual aid association fees, and fundraising, each mass must store a basket of grain, a pound of oil, and half a catty of salt for the bandit army, and every woman must make shoes for the bandit army, beat grass horses, send fruits, donate cotton clothes, and also cultivate public fields and fields of the bandit army family for the bandit army. What sentry duty, conscription, meetings, stretcher teams, transportation teams, and so on, are all forced to come. If they resist, they will be charged with counter-revolution, and the masses will suffer from hunger and cold, cry out bitterly, and their lives are miserable beyond description. Because of this, under the influence of seven points of politics in the fifth encirclement and suppression campaign, a very large number of the masses turned back to the banner of the Blue Sky and White Sun to find a way out. 5. Factional Division: Inside the Communist bandits, due to the disunity of political propositions and the excessive intensity of class struggle, a large number of factional organizations have occurred, such as the reorganization faction, the AB group, the love research society, the Third Party, the cancellation faction, the left leaning, the right leaning, the opportunism Li San line, the Luo Ming line, and other names. These people are fighting each other, which is a symbol of his tangible collapse.</p>
<p>6. Ideological Shaking: Those who have a little thought are shaking politically because they see that the strategies being carried out by the Communist Party cannot adapt to the current Chinese struggle which is too intense, and ideological shaking occurs. Shaking produces factions, and factions produce struggles. The result of the struggle is mutual loss and injury, or being killed, or being arrested, or running away. People with simple thoughts are shaking purely because their lives are too hard and the discipline is too strict. They just want to drag their guns and surrender in exchange for money to go home.</p>
<p>7. The Fatal Wound of the Communist Bandits: The Communist Bandits have always believed that any difficulty that is tangible can be overcome with a tenacious and arduous spirit. Only intangible enemies, if not encountered, are fine, but if encountered, they become a fatal wound. What they fear most is the improvement of policies. Now, suppressing bandits with seven points of politics has already given him a fatal wound. In the current society that has not yet established the country with morality, practicing the New Life Movement, improving personal integrity, and promoting the Three People's Principles that are suitable for the national conditions, has given a great blow to the policy background of the Communist Bandits in an intangible way. He has no way to save his demise. As for the strong men in the bandit areas, who have died almost to the last one, and the lack of a source of supply of materials and military supplies, this is an inevitable phenomenon in all bandit areas.

<h3 id="e103">Severe Drought in Jiangxi Province <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The Fields Are Cracked and the Early Rice is Withered. The Price of Rice in Nanchang City Has Already Soared. Nanchang Communication: Since the several heavy rains before the Dragon Boat Festival in this province caused floods in the Xiu, Yuan, Rui, Fu, Rao, Xin, Ji, and Gan rivers, there has been no rain since then, for more than a month now, without a single drop. The heat continues to rise and increase, and it has reached above 100 degrees before the Little Heat. The hotter the climate, the faster the moisture evaporates. The water level of the Gan River has dropped, just like in winter. The ponds and ports are even worse. At the beginning of June in the lunar calendar, the temperature in this city is often between 104 and 106 degrees, breaking the record of decades. The drought in various places is becoming more and more serious. All the early rice can still be harvested. Farmers along the rivers, lakes, and those who have dug ponds and wells can rescue the rice with water day and night. However, the soil in the higher fields and those that mature later is cracked, the color of the rice is withered and yellow, and there is no way to save it. There is no water to draw for those who have planted the late rice, and there is no water to transplant for those who have not planted it. The bankrupt rural areas are covered with another heavy mist. Especially since the bandit disaster in Jiangxi has lasted for seven or eight years, what can be more disastrous than this severe drought in the midst of bandit and flood disasters? At about 4:00 PM on the 16th of this month, the sky was filled with clouds, followed by a strong north wind. Everyone looked forward to it, thinking that they could fill the land with sweet rain. However, after a few drops of rain fell, the clouds dispersed and the sky cleared. The rain was not smooth yesterday and today, and it did not help the agricultural affairs. In the past few days, the price of rice has risen from six yuan to seven yuan and several jiao. The well water is shallow and dry, and the river water is expensive. There is a problem with the drinking water for civilians. In addition, during the drought and heat, epidemics are rampant. The provincial health department is conducting epidemic prevention injections in five districts of the city. The public security bureau strictly prohibits coolies from sleeping in the open. The authorities have taken two pumps in the city and lent them to the water conservancy bureau to pump water in the Fu River for the drought relief issue, but there are no other practical methods. The farmers are at a loss, and they can only lift the Bodhisattva to ask for rain. (17th)</p>
<p>Qingjiang's Prolonged Drought Has Resulted in a Famine</p>
<h3 id="e104">There is No Hope for the Autumn Harvest in the North Countryside <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Qingjiang is a county in Jiangxi Province that produces rice. Every year, the grain produced is more than enough for the local people to eat. In mid-June of this year, a river flood broke out, causing a vast expanse of water. After the water receded, it was followed by seasonal rain, causing the pools and lakes to be full of water. The farmers in the east, west, and south of the county were all overjoyed, celebrating the signs of a good harvest year, meaning that even if it did not rain for half a month from now, they would not be without water to draw. However, the land in the north countryside is low-lying, and it has the name of a water village. When the water rises, the early rice is submerged. The private dikes built around the countryside are counted in numbers, and those that have been washed down by the water are still half-flooded. Not only is there no hope for the autumn harvest, but also the current life is very difficult. As for the east, west, and south, because there has been no rain for a long time recently, the stored water has been used up and there is no water to irrigate. They are sitting and waiting to die. If there is still some remaining water available for irrigation, they work day and night, and their hands and feet are calloused, so that the rice can be expected to survive. But the farmers are exhausted and have already lost more than they gained. In addition, most of the rice crops show signs of withering. The scorching heat has not subsided, and the signs of famine have already appeared. The people in the cities and villages are now looking forward to the rain, and they are using various superstitious methods to ask for rain. Unfortunately, the sweet rain is still not falling. The rice merchants in Zhangshu have already raised the price of rice by two or three yuan. If it does not rain again, the people's food will be very worrying.

<h3 id="e105">Arriving in Lanzhou <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>June 3rd: Departed from Shiguaizi and Wulishahui well. Due to rushing the previous day, the horse was exhausted and unable to proceed, so another one was hired and sent to Lanzhou for a price of four yuan. The land here needs to be left fallow to replenish its fertility, and some even leave it for two or three years, otherwise it is futile. At Ganlu Pond, 20 li away, I studied with an old farmer about the method of planting with sand, which can be used as fertilizer. The reasons are roughly: (1) The stone has a moistening air, which can nourish crops; (2) After rain, it can retain moisture and does not dry for a long time; (3) During storms, it can suppress the roots of crops; (4) The soil is firm and dry, and lacks fertilizer, so it is difficult to expect a harvest without laying sand and stones. However, the sand-laying project is vast, and each mu of land requires a layer of three or four cun thick, costing more than sixty gold coins. Moreover, the effect of new laying is slight, and the power declines over time. The prosperous period is only twenty or thirty years, at most fifty or sixty years, and then it must be discarded and replaced. Therefore, there is a saying: "The old man suffers to death, the son eats to death, and the grandson starves to death." In other provinces, when cultivating, if there are sand and stones, they must be removed, but here it is the opposite. Although it is said to be suitable for the land, it is not a good method after all. Moreover, it is said that "how thick the sand is, how deep the cultivation is." If it is not sandy land, it is only shallow cultivation of two or three cun, which is very different from the method of deep cultivation. Most of the fields in Gansu Province are widely planted and sparsely harvested, and not knowing deep cultivation is a major reason. It is not only the lack of water.</p>
<p>The population in the village was originally lush and dense. In the eighteenth year of the drought, nearly half of the people starved to death. Now the fields are barren, year after year. On the one hand, it is due to the sparse population, and on the other hand, it is due to the lack of capital for cultivation. Before the eighteenth year, ordinary interest rates, although as high as 50% to 100%, were painfully exploited, but there was still a place to borrow. But since the eighteenth year, the entire people have been impoverished. If there are any savings, in order to avoid the coveting of the poor and the excessive burden of errands, they all pretend to be poor to block the door for borrowing. Farmers, in order to purchase seeds and other emergency needs, even if they mortgage their property at several times the interest rate, no one dares to respond. As a result, they miss the farming season and force people to death everywhere. To make it recover, a credit cooperative is needed.</p>
<p>At Liudunzi, 20 li away, there are sixty or seventy households. The well is twelve zhang deep, and someone specializes in the job of drawing water. The method is to place a simple pulley on the well, tie a bucket with a rope, and lower it into the well. At the other end, livestock are used to pull the rope, going as far as twelve zhang. The bucket rises, pours water, and returns to its original place. One person controls the bucket, and one person drives the animals back and forth. It is very time-consuming and labor-intensive. Villagers pay one sheng of wheat per person per year for drinking water, and one he (approximately two jiao and five fen) per animal per month. Travelers who water their horses pay five copper coins per head each time. If there is a drought and the spring dries up, it is even more expensive than nectar. Therefore, to revitalize agriculture, water conservancy is the primary issue. Whether storing mountain floods or using machines to draw well water, it is not easy to do without huge capital.</p>
<p>The area of land is mostly measured in "chang," with each "chang" approximately equal to two and a half mu, worth forty or fifty yuan. If wheat is planted, the annual harvest is two or three dou, worth about fourteen or fifteen yuan. If poppies are planted, five or sixty liang of opium gum can be harvested, worth about thirty yuan. However, compared to planting wheat, it requires five yuan more fertilizer and eleven or twelve yuan more labor. If the harvest is small or the price falls, it is not as profitable as planting wheat. The above-mentioned yield refers to ordinary new sandy land. If it is old sandy land, I am afraid there will be no such harvest. The field tax is five he of grain per chang, worth about thirty cents in silver, plus one yuan for Qingxiang fees, and about three yuan per year for errands and miscellaneous expenses. The income and expenditure are mostly insufficient. Therefore, there is a saying in the local area: "Farmers do not calculate accounts, but calculate how full their bellies are."</p>
<p>At Sandunzi, 30 li away, we stayed overnight at sunset. That day, we traveled a total of 75 li. The residents, sixty or seventy households, had returned from farming and herding, and it was already dark. Most of them held bowls and drank noodle soup under the starlight in front of the eaves. There is a street running east and west, about a li long, with houses lined up, but only three families can be seen with lights on. I stayed in a horse inn, where the manure and grass in the earthen trough were close to the room. There were no windows to sleep, and the stench was overwhelming. The kang was piled with dust, and the wall lamp was dim. Someone jokingly wrote a poem about this scene: "Earthen kang and stone pillow, lamp oil flows down the wall (a broken bowl bottom is used as a lamp, placed high in the wall hole, the oil overflows and flows down, the wall slides with black ditches, and the pit collects it, which can be used again), one night of feeling lice, all night of listening to horse urine." It can be called a living painting.</p>
<p>On the 4th, because I wanted to rush to Lanzhou, I left Sandunzi at 3:00 AM. Initially, I entered the mountains and did not see open space for a long time. The road is divided into a highway and a post road. The highway is high, wide, and flat, while the post road is low, concave, and rugged. Many vehicles abandoned the post road and took the highway without permission. The road bureau could not prohibit it, so they dug deep drainage ditches in the middle of the highway. Cars could still pass, but horse-drawn carriages were stuck in a dilemma, inevitably trapping the wheels or stumbling the horses. We were caught in their trap and could not extricate ourselves. I deeply regret that the pit was not dug at the beginning of the road, but in the middle, and that the post road was not repaired, so that the sedan carriers avoided difficulties and took the easy way, often mistakenly falling into deep pits. This is not the intention of a benevolent person. The ground beside the road is full of mouse holes. Measuring the distance, there is one hole every two square feet. The entrances of the holes are all newly placed wheat seedlings or artemisia grass, which are the leftovers from the mice's food. If most of the crops are poppies, and there are one or two mu of wheat ears that are just ripening, the mice will gather in hundreds and thousands, and they will be able to destroy them completely in one day and night. This is not only for their immediate consumption, but also mostly dragged into the holes and stored as winter food. Therefore, the harm of mice is more severe than locusts. There are crows with bright red beaks and distances, which are said to be able to prey on small mice, but the effect is minimal.</p>
<p>At Shuibu River, 70 li away, there are fifty or sixty residents. The stream is clear and the willows line the banks, a pleasant scenery rarely seen since entering Gansu. I had "liangfen" for lunch, each small bowl costing one jiao. In Beijing, it would only be worth two or three fen. I asked why the price of snacks was so high, and how could the people afford to eat? The answer was: "Villagers mostly eat wheat bran, wild vegetables, or yam eggs. The beans, wheat flour, soy sauce, vinegar, etc. used to make this liangfen and liangmian are all purchased from Gaolan. The villagers really have no ability to buy food." The gentlemen traveling with me ate fried rice, and the number of people watching with drooling mouths increased. The eaters were embarrassed and wanted to stop. An old man smiled sadly and said, "Our land has not seen rice since the three years of drought, which is almost ten years. How can we want to eat it?" The fried rice was originally brought from Zhongwei, to be prepared for the lack of food at the Sisha station. Now that the sand station has passed, and Lanzhou is in sight, why carry it? So it was distributed to the onlookers, who were all happy and grateful. Someone said, "This is not enough to be miserable. In various counties in Longxi, people pile hot sand in pits in winter, and people lie in it to keep warm. Girls over ten years old still have bare legs and no pants to wear. In the past, people sold their sons and daughters, and someone would buy them, but now no. Because those who bought other people's sons and daughters in the past now also want to sell their wives and daughters, but they are suffering from having no way to do so. Therefore, relief is more urgent than development, which is true for the entire Northwest, and especially true for Gansu. Who says it is not appropriate?"</p>
<p>Horse-drawn carriages used in the Northwest provinces</p>
<p>At Sandao Xian, 15 li away, the slope goes up and down three times, as steep as a ladder to the sky. The road around the Erdao Xian peak is especially dangerous, as it is occupied by bandits. At the foot of the slope is a mountain village, where poppies are budding and about to bloom, and wheat seedlings have sprouted ears. The tombs are planted with many trees, with tall trunks reaching the sky, providing cool shade. However, the village and mountain areas are bare without a single green tree. I flicked my whip, wanting to find a branch but could not. At Zhongbaozi, 15 li away, the Gaolan Mountain stretches across the clouds, towering in sight. About fourteen of the twenty households in the village live in caves. Leaving Zao Yuan, I went down along a well, with dangerous cliffs on both sides. About fourteen households live in caves. Leaving Jiyuan, I went along roads made into blocks, plastered on the walls, and exposed to the sun to be used as fuel. At Lanzhou, 15 li away, it was already night. The electric lights shone like a painting. The sound of the Yellow River was very loud, making people feel silent. The city gate was closed, and I stayed overnight at Jincheng Pass. That day, I traveled a total of 140 li. The next morning, I entered the city and settled in the Zhonghua Hotel. In total, the journey from Ning to Lan was more than 1,200 li, with fourteen horse stations. When the car is running, it will arrive in four days. The Ninglan air service is even more convenient.</p>
<p>County government reports on disaster relief planning</p>
<h3 id="e106">Songjiang <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Since the beginning of summer, the heat has been increasing, and there has been no rain for a long time, causing the crops to wither. The farmers in each township are worried about the drought and are planning to remedy it. Fortunately, since the 10th, there has been light rain every day, which has provided some moisture. County Magistrate Jin recently telegraphed to the heads of the three departments of the Provincial Government Chairman, People's Finance, and Construction, reporting that "Since the beginning of summer in Songyi, there has been very little rainfall. According to statistics, in more than seventy days, only 131.7 millimeters of rainfall have been received. In the past month, the temperature has been unusually high, and the scorching sun has evaporated the water, causing the agricultural rivers to dry up and the land to crack. At this time, the seedlings are just being planted, and farming is in full swing. The villagers work hard day and night, but they suffer from the difficulty of drawing water and the limited effectiveness. The cattle are overworked and die frequently. On the 12th of this month, there was a brief shower in Xinzhuang, a village in the east, but it cleared up immediately. If it does not rain again, it will lead to a drought. As the county magistrate, it is my duty to plan day and night and dare not be negligent. In addition to the prevention of locusts and famine, I have followed the repeated orders and instructed the competent authorities to actively plan for contingencies. It has been found that a small number of fields in Pubei are in urgent need of relief due to the difficulty of drawing water. Although the current situation in other places can be barely maintained, it cannot last for long. Punan, on the other hand, has a higher terrain, and the signs of disaster have already appeared, especially in the areas of Shanyang Caojing and the southern part of Tinglin. Previously, I convened Chen Xingyuan, the manager of the Agricultural Extension Institute, Ding Zhenya, the cooperation instructor, and invited Li Jiannong, the president of the Farmers Bank, to study the methods of drought prevention and disaster relief in detail. The general decisions were: (1) The Agricultural Extension Institute will send staff to investigate the fields in Shanyang Caojing and the southern part of Tinglin that have not been planted and have died of drought, and prepare to replant buckwheat and green beans. The funds for purchasing seeds will be allocated from the business expenses of the Extension Institute. (2) The county government will first purchase four water pumping machines, which will cost approximately four thousand yuan, and borrow them from the farmers at interest. These water pumping machines will be rented and used by the people in the disaster-stricken areas. The detailed methods have been decided at the 22nd Political Affairs Meeting. The matter of borrowing funds from the Farmers Bank has also been telegraphed for approval. This is the general situation of the severe drought in Songyi since the beginning of summer, and the planned prevention and rescue measures. On the 18th of this month, 15.5 millimeters of rain fell in the urban area. According to telephone inquiries, most of the townships in Pubei have also received timely rain of varying amounts. If it continues to rain extensively, most of the farmland is expected to recover. The purchase of pumping machines can be temporarily postponed. However, the fields in the south that have died of drought must be replanted with buckwheat and green beans as soon as possible to compensate for the losses. I have already ordered the Extension Institute to actively handle it. All the dried-up agricultural rivers have also been ordered to be dredged as soon as possible to facilitate irrigation. This is the general situation of the long-term drought in Songyi and the urgent handling of the situation. In addition to continuing to plan and handle things according to circumstances, I am aware of the situation and respectfully report the severe drought in Songyi since the beginning of summer, the planned prevention and rescue measures, and the handling of the aftermath of the long-term drought and rain. Jin Tigan, County Magistrate of Songjiang, bows." Watergate sets up water station for drought relief</p>

<p>Suzhou has not received adequate rainfall for two months, causing great impact on drinking water and farmland. Although there has been occasional light rain recently, it has not been of practical help. The county government, in view of this, specially followed the provincial government's meeting to decide on drought relief measures. First, a water station was set up in Xukou, building dikes to divert water. Yesterday (19th), a notice was specially issued to ships traveling to and from the area, ordering them to stop navigation to implement the construction project. At the same time, Wang Kanggu, an engineer from the Construction Department, was allowed to say that the flood dam between Taihu Lake and Yunhu Lake in Wangting District had an urgent need to be opened. Therefore, the district chief of the fourth district of Wangting, Lu, has been ordered to raise 150 workers on a deadline to wait for dispatch.</p>
<p>Demolishing floodgates to relieve drought</p>

<p>Wang Yuangu, an engineer from the Jiangsu Construction Department, was ordered to come to Wuxi to preside over the extraction of river and lake water sources to relieve the drought. Accompanied by Huang Dechun, the technical section chief of the county construction bureau, he inspected the water flow at Liangxikou, Taibaodun, and Li Bridge. Yesterday morning (18th) at about 7:00 AM, Engineer Wang, Section Chief Huang, and Xia Shouzheng, an engineer transferred from the Construction Department to Wuxi for assistance, took a car to Wangting to inspect the water level of Wangting Bridge. The river there is currently flowing towards Suzhou to the east. They then went to Xiangshui Bridge and Tonghu Bridge, Changzhao Canal, floodgates, and other places for inspection. Then they went to Shadun Port and the Shaduntou area for inspection and measurement. It was estimated that the current water volume in the port is about two meters deep or more, and the width of the inlet is 25 meters, with a depth of about 1.5 meters. The natural water flow is still sufficient, so Engineer Wang believes that there is no need to set up a station. However, the exit of the port is directly connected to the Grand Canal. Because the water flow was rapid and rushed into the Grand Canal, hindering the safety of navigation, a floodgate was specially built. The only way for the port's water to exit is at Xiangshui Bridge. The bridge has three bridge holes, with a total width of less than five meters. Therefore, the water flow is difficult, and the water level inside and outside differs by as much as one foot. The solution is to open the floodgate so that the water volume can flow smoothly and unhindered. The northwest can flow to the northeastern townships of Xijing, and the southwest can flow to Suzhou. Demolition began yesterday (19th). The required project funds will be temporarily advanced by the county. Engineer Wang personally supervised and guided the work. The dredging of the Lujiangkou River channel has been completed. The dam was removed and water was released. Regarding the problem of relieving drinking water in the urban area, the First District Office has hired a machine to pump water into the city, which costs three yuan and five jiao per hour. It is now planned to use 400 yuan of levee repair funds. The insufficient amount will be raised by the town chiefs through donations.</p>

<p>Since the Minor Heat, there have been occasional hurricanes from the northwest, and the climate has turned slightly cooler, with the thermometer dropping to ninety-three or ninety-four degrees. However, the sunshine is very strong at noon. At about 2:00 PM on the 18th, the wind and clouds in the sky were urgent, and soon the darkness was dark. There was heavy rain in the middle of the sunlight, which lasted about four or five minutes. At about 5:00 PM, there was another heavy rain, which lasted for ten minutes before stopping. The southeastern part of the rural area received more rain. Kaiyuan Township, Meiyuan, Xiaojishan, and the area along Taihu Lake received two or three cun of rain. The other places, such as Nanqiao, Yuqi, Dongting, Nanfangquan, and Jiangxi Bridge, each received between one cun and two or three fen of rain. In addition, the county public security bureau, in order to remove the accumulated manure in the city, specially convened a temporary symposium yesterday to decide to recruit fifty manure collectors, entrust the fertilizer cooperative to transport them, and excavate a manure pool outside the East Gate.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Jiangsu and Zhejiang Silk Industry Discuss Standard Silk Prices <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have suffered setbacks due to the recent sharp decline in the silk market. When the spring silkworms entered the market this year, the domestic silk price was still worth more than 500 yuan per dan, but recently it has fallen to 87 yuan. One of the reasons is the sluggishness of the European and American silk markets. However, the industry groups are not strong and there is no officially set price or powerful restraint, which has led to panic and a willingness to sell at a discount. This is the main reason. Therefore, it has been decided to hold a joint meeting at the General Office of the Silk Industry on North Shanxi Road in Shanghai at 3:00 PM on the 22nd of this month to decide on the standard silk price in order to maintain the precarious silk market. Yesterday, a special letter was sent to the local silk factory association, asking them to send six representatives to attend the meeting and discuss.</p>

<p>The Shenxin No. 3 Textile Factory yesterday presented a telegram to Wang, the President of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance, Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry, and the Cotton Industry Control Committee of the National Economic Council in Shanghai, which stated: "Reports say that Shenxin in Shanghai will be reorganized by the Ministry, and the candidates for the committee have reportedly been internally determined. It has been found that Shenxin's factories, whether in Shanghai or Wuxi, are all operated by businessmen surnamed Sun. The No. 1, 3, and 4 factories are especially independent as unlimited liability companies limited by shares. They have all been registered with the Ministry and have been issued licenses as proof. In terms of the shareholders' responsibilities, they should be limited to each factory. As far as Wuxi is concerned, the business has been profitable and has not been in deficit, so there is no need for reorganization. If the reorganization of the Shanghai factories is extended to Wuxi, it is actually to destroy in the name of maintenance. This sets a bad example for the company. Who would dare to invest? The shareholders will never approve it. In addition to applying to Shenxin No. 3 Factory in the capacity of shareholders, we hereby declare to Shanghai that we request your review. We are urgent and cannot choose our words. We beg you to pay attention and do not disappoint our expectations. We are sending this urgently and respectfully ask for your approval.

<p>Wuyi's weather is extremely dry, and farmers are eagerly awaiting rain. The day before yesterday (17th) afternoon, Heaven finally showered sweet rain. When the rain poured down, Zhang Linfa, a villager near Minghuang Town in the 8th District, and his wife, Mrs. Zhang, were working in the field. Seeing the heavy rain, they were about to return home when they were suddenly struck by lightning. The husband and wife died in the field at the same time. When their family members sent an umbrella, they found that the two were lying stiff on the ground, already dead. Also, Xu, a villager in Dongsha Village, north of Zhaizhai Bridge, was over fifty years old. He was also working in the field at the time, and suddenly encountered thunder and rain. Xu was sucked from the air to the opposite bank and killed by lightning. His whole body turned charred black. Zhenjiang Automotive and Railway Transport</p>

It was officially established on the 16th of this month. The director, Wang Yuanchen, also took office on the same day. Because the summer weather is hot and the people are most prone to disease, in order to facilitate the poor and sick, a first clinic (reorganized by the provincial hospital's clinic) was attached to the office. The original civilian clinic in Gongshantang Lane outside the city was changed to the second clinic. The heads of the health police in each sub-bureau were also summoned yesterday to give instructions.</p>

In the future, when necessary, it can be taken out to hold Pingxi to maintain the people's food. As for the farmers, they are still hoping for rain in order to save ten thousand. On the 17th and 18th nights, there were slight showers here, but very little in the urban area, and even less in the northwest. According to reports from various townships in the southwest, such as Mocheng, Xizhuang Baimao, Hupu, etc., the maximum amount of rainfall reached one inch, and the minimum amount was only two or three points. If it continues to fall in the day, the autumn harvest is expected to be more promising.</p>

<p>The Wengang in each township in Jiaxing has no water, and farmers cannot irrigate. Although the Drought Prevention Committee has prepared funds to purchase machines and distribute them to farmers for pumping water, the area is vast and difficult to spread widely. Also, because port has no water, the fields with wrapping are still difficult to protect. More than 3,000 farmers in the 6th District went to the 6th District Office in the early morning of the 19th to announce the famine, all holding withered rice. District Chief Lin Nianren avoided coming out. Later, 500-600 farmers, together with Assistant Lin from the District Office, walked from Yuxian Town to Jiaxing (a journey of more than 20 miles). At 9:00 a.m., they went to the county to announce the famine. They piled withered rice on the hall and requested that the collection of grain from the scattered warehouses be stopped for disaster relief. Section Chief Li of the County Government and instructor Mei Zizhi came out as representatives to persuade the farmers to return. County Magistrate Jiang went to the countryside two days later to inspect the disaster situation. After the inspection, there will be practical methods. Until noon, everyone dispersed. When the villagers crowded into the county government, the county surveillance team and the infrastructure tunnels persuaded them separately, and the order was good.</p>

<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Upon reading the "Truth of the Risheng Lou Bloodshed Case" news in your newspaper's Jiashan news on July 16th, which stated that "Li Shi-can and Xu Mingde were transferred to the Home Guard" and "Xu Mingde and Li Shi-can knew they had caused trouble, hired a boat to escape, and took two Home Guard rifles with them," and again, the July 17th news "Major Criminals in the East Gate Bloodshed Case Arrested" which stated "after the two criminals Li Shi-can and Xu Mingde caused trouble, they took away two rifles and one short firearm," and "the two criminals were indeed found carrying firearms in the Donghu area of Pinghu," all of which are inconsistent with the facts. It has been verified that there was previously an organization of the Chengxiang Voluntary Home Guard in our district, which was then ordered to be reorganized into a Home Guard standby team. However, the standing teams of each Jia in our district were ordered to be disbanded as early as the end of February of this year. All firearms were the responsibility of each Jia to keep safe, and there were no shortages. The sections mentioned in your newspaper are entirely fictitious, likely based on mistaken rumors. Deeply concerned about causing confusion and affecting the reputation of our district corps, we are sending this special letter to correct the record. We hope you will publish it to rectify the rumors. Sincerely,</p>
<p>To the Editorial Department of Shanghai Shen Bao Newspaper,</p>

This move suggests dissatisfaction with the Control Yuan. Furthermore, due to my own physical weakness and illness that has not yet recovered, I have decided to return to my ancestral home in Shaanxi within this week to recuperate. I will make a short stop when passing through Nanjing. The corner of his mouth is still slightly crooked, and Lu Zhong'an, the national physician treating him, has coordinated herbal pills for him to take after leaving Shanghai.</p>

<p>According to reports on the status of North China, Huang Fu remains passive, and Yin Tong is coming to Shanghai soon, according to the Far East News Agency, Tang Youren, Permanent Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, arrived in Shanghai at 7:30 AM yesterday morning on the night express from Nanjing. After disembarking, he went directly to his residence on Gansidong Road. Around 9:00 AM, he met with Okano, a staff officer from the Japanese warship Tsushima. At 3:30 PM, Zhou Zuomin, General Manager of Jin Cheng Bank, visited him and left after about an hour of discussion. Subsequently, Tang Youren met with a reporter from the Far East News Agency and made the following remarks:</p>
<h3 id="e127">North China is Pathologically Quiet <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Tang Youren began by saying that although the situation in North China appears to be quiet, this quiet is not normal but pathological. Within this pathological quiet, there are still hidden worries, so we cannot be overly optimistic and should strive to restore normalcy.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Huang Fu Remains Pessimistic <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>He continued, saying that Chairman Huang (Fu)'s attitude remains passive. He feels that negotiations with the Japanese are difficult. The Kwantung Army's attitude is ambiguous and lacks sincerity, constantly engaging us in minor matters while consistently prevaricating on more important issues, such as unresolved wartime negotiations. Therefore, he is currently unwilling to return north. However, the central government will not allow him to remain passive. They are now trying to resolve his difficulties so that he will not have to make excuses and can return north as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e129">New Plan Rumors are Inaccurate <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>I met with Chairman Huang and Director Yin (Tong) at Mogan Mountain, only to listen to Huang's explanation of his difficulties, which I will relay to President Wang so that he can find ways to resolve them. Rumors that we had discussed a new plan for negotiations with Japan in North China and that this new plan had been approved by the central government are merely speculation.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Yin Tong Will Arrive in Shanghai Within Days <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Tang Youren then answered a reporter's question, stating that after returning to Nanjing from Mogan Mountain, he relayed the situation to President Wang and discussed ways to resolve Huang's difficulties. He came to Shanghai because it is cooler than Nanjing and plans to stay for a few days. Within these few days, Yin will come to Shanghai from Hangzhou to meet with him. However, it is not yet determined whether Yin will return to Hangzhou or go directly north. Tang paused here, and the reporter asked if Yin's visit was to hear Tang's response regarding resolving Huang's difficulties and then relay it to Huang. Tang nodded in agreement but firmly refused to reveal the content of the response.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Abolishing the Tanggu Truce <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Tang Youren later discussed the abolition of the Tanggu Truce, stating that the Truce was intended to be temporary and, in fact, no longer has any value. It is not impossible to abolish, but the Japanese side does not agree to the abolition unless we pay a considerable price; it cannot be abolished unconditionally. Whether our side will propose negotiations is still under consideration.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Postal Issues Remain Unresolved <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Continuing, he stated that the rumors of a resolution to the postal issue are inaccurate. Currently, letters sent from outside the passes to inside the passes with "Manchukuo" stamps are still considered underpaid. However, many now attach Chinese stamps, purchased in bulk from inside the passes for this purpose. As for letters sent from inside the passes to outside the passes, they are stamped with Chinese stamps. However, it is unknown whether they (referring to "Manchukuo") also consider them underpaid upon arrival.</p>

<p>=Detailed Explanation of Revised New Tariff, Guo and Others Bitterly Explain the Pros and Cons of Implementation= According to Xin Xin News Agency, since the announcement of the new tariff, various industrial and commercial sectors in this city believe that the tariff is closely related to the future of Chinese industry and commerce and have wired the authorities, one after another, requesting correction to maintain industry. It is learned that Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi, seeing that many in Shanghai's industrial sector have not been able to fully understand the contents of the new tariff, specially invited industrial leaders Guo Shun, Hu Xiyuan, Ji Jiannan, Wang Yaochen, and others to the Central Bank yesterday morning for discussions. Minister Kong met them in person. After Guo Shun and others bitterly explained the pros and cons of implementing the new tariff, Kong explained the additions and reductions of the new tariff in detail, stating that the revised import tariff was completed by experts hired by the Ministry of Finance after six months of study and revision. Extreme caution was taken, which is extremely beneficial to our country. He has always been extremely concerned about commerce and will never allow domestic merchants to be in a desperate situation. The two sides talked for about an hour before Guo Shun and others took their leave.</p>

<p>=Funds to be Borrowed by the Reorganization Committee or Raised Through Public Bonds, Still Under Discussion=</p>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, Shenxin Cotton Mill has suffered significant losses over the years due to the impact of the economic downturn. After Rong Zongjing, the general manager of the mill, announced his retirement, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, the National Economic Commission, the Cotton Control Commission, and other agencies took charge of the reorganization. According to reports from investigators sent to Shanghai by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, the mill's debt is more than 13 million yuan to the Bank of China and more than 8 million yuan to the Shanghai Bank. In addition to the debt, at least 2 million yuan is needed for reorganization to maintain operations. It is learned that the Ministry of Industry has submitted the investigation report to the Executive Yuan and recommended a detailed reorganization plan, roughly as follows: (1) All factories should be maintained and not shut down; (2) The distribution and planning of relief funds should be submitted to the government by the Reorganization Committee for separate solutions. Therefore, the focus of the reorganization has become an economic issue. However, the Ministry of Industry has no funds to allocate, so the Cotton Control Commission, the Ministry of Finance, and the Economic Commission must find ways to allocate funds. As for the rumor of issuing relief bonds, this was previously suggested by someone. The method of raising funds is still to be decided by the Ministry of Finance, the Economic Commission, and other agencies.</p>

The hurricane has reached the north of Taiwan and continues to move northwest. At 6:00 AM yesterday, it had reached 30 nautical miles from the intersection of 25 degrees north latitude and 122 degrees east longitude. Commercial vessels sailing to Nanhua and various coastal ports in Zhejiang are at risk of being affected. The Observatory issued a special warning. The unlisted liner Haiyan and the Nanyang ship Gongping have both received this warning and have sailed to Lot Sin Bay to anchor and avoid the hurricane and avoid unexpected dangers. At the same time, various sea vessels reported to Shanghai to temporarily suspend navigation in transit to avoid the wind. Other Nanhua liners and Zhejiang coastal merchant ships are also uniformly prevented from suspending sailing.</p>

<p>The City's Fire Department Mobilized to the Fullest, Drought Prevention Committee Purchases Five Machines According to the Central News Agency, the municipal government recently recognized that the weather is extremely dry, the farmland in various rural areas of the city is withered, and a disaster is imminent. It is urgent to find ways to provide relief to maintain people's livelihoods. After discussions at the municipal conference, in addition to allocating funds to purchase a large number of water pumps to be distributed to various rural areas, it was also decided to send representatives from the Public Security, Social Affairs, Finance, and Land Bureaus, as well as representatives from various rural areas, to form a Drought Prevention Committee. As it was not possible to purchase water pumps immediately, it was decided that the fire brigades of the city would send pump vehicles with strong mechanical power to pump water in various rural areas to relieve the immediate crisis. Public Security Bureau Director Wen ordered Dong Zhihe of the Fire Prevention Section of the Second Division to assign the Shanghai South District Fire Brigade Joint Association, the Zhabei Fire Brigades, the Jiangwan, Zhenru, and Gaoqiao Fire Brigades to send twelve pump trucks to be responsible for the operation. The urgent relief areas include ten districts: Shanghai South Longhua, Caohejing, Pusong, Pengpu, Yinxiang, Jiangwan, Zhenru, Gaoqiao, and Zhabei. The Pengpu and Zhabei districts have already started the relief work. After receiving the order, the fire brigades of the city were all extremely excited and willing to participate in the relief. The working conditions of the fire brigades are recorded below:</p>
<p>Zhabei District This district has more than 20,000 acres of farmland. A rural representative from the district, Zhao Zuolin, personally led three large pump trucks from the Zhabei First, Second, and Fourth Fire Brigades to station in the Liuying Shuodian Road area of Zhabei. Under the command of Zhabei Fire Brigade Captain Wang Baoyu, Second Fire Brigade Captain Cao Xufan, and Fourth Fire Brigade Captain Chen Yousheng, thirty firefighters pumped water in the Henghama River and used two thousand feet of leather straps to transport it to the Hujiazhai tributary. This tributary can connect to more than one hundred branches, so the farmland in Zhabei District relies entirely on this tributary for water. Since the beginning of summer, the tributary has dried up and is difficult to use. The fire brigade worked hard to pump water from 3:00 PM until 3:00 AM yesterday, totaling more than 250,000 gallons. The tributary is now more than four feet deep and has been distributed to various branches. The villagers are all overjoyed and grateful to the fire brigade.</p>
<p>Pengpu District The captain of the Third Fire Brigade of Zhabei led ten firefighters and drove a large pump truck to pump water from the Pengpu Town River and distribute it to various tributaries. From 3:00 PM the day before yesterday to 3:00 PM yesterday, a total of 350,000 gallons of water was pumped. The tributaries, which were originally dry, are now more than five feet deep. The villagers have obtained water and have started farming. Public Security Bureau Director Wen Hongen was very impressed with the efforts of the fire brigade officials, who worked hard in the scorching sun, and specially went to visit and comfort them yesterday afternoon, accompanied by Dong Zhihe of the Fire Prevention Section of the bureau. It is also learned that the American Paramount Pictures Company and the Mainland Zilin News Paper Office have both sent personnel to take photos to send to various countries as news material.</p>
<p>Drought Relief Association According to New Voice News Agency, the third meeting was held at Yiyuan at 4:00 PM yesterday to discuss detailed implementation measures. As a result, (1) it was decided to purchase three more water pumps, (2) borrowing machines from the Junpu Bureau has been negotiated and is awaiting municipal government approval, (3) machine oil, miscellaneous expenses, and dam construction fees will all be directly issued by the municipal government. It is heard that the association has purchased three water pumps from the Xintong Company, one with 14 horsepower, to be distributed to the Gaohang District for application, and the remaining two with 11 horsepower to be distributed to the Lixing and Tangqiao districts. Two machines were also purchased from the Shanghai Machinery Factory, each with 6 horsepower, to be distributed to the Yinxiang and Pusong districts. Each district will also have a representative from the Social Affairs Bureau, together with the Farmers' Association of each district, to supervise the progress daily. The goods will be delivered and transported to various districts for application today.</p>

<p>The Walking National Propaganda Group Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday from Nanjing</p>
<p>After the signing of the Tanggu Agreement, Chen Zhenglong and other anti-Japanese righteous soldiers from the September 18th Incident specially organized the China National Promotion Aviation Saving the Country Walking National Propaganda Group. There are hundreds of members in various places, led by Chen Zhenglong. He came to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday to publish a call to compatriots and a declaration, which are recorded separately below:</p>
<h3 id="e142">Departure Declaration <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Our China National Promotion Aviation Saving the Country Walking National Propaganda Group has now walked to your place. Each of our team members has been to the Northeast for two years after the September 18th Incident to fight the violent Japanese. The battles we have been through include more than a hundred large and small battles in Liaodong, Jinzhou, Chaoyang, Qinghe, Yixian, Lingyuan, Jianping, Liuhe, Kairo, Pingquan, and other places, until the Tanggu Agreement. We endured the pain and tears and returned to our fields, healed our wounds, and organized the current Promotion Aviation Saving the Country Walking National Propaganda Group. The purpose of our group is to carry out the teachings of the late Premier and realize the three principles of the people's country, to awaken our compatriots, to pool our wisdom and efforts, and to strive for aviation construction in order to achieve the foundation of strengthening national defense and reviving the nation. The organization of our group has been approved and filed by the Central Propaganda Committee, and we are instructed to be guided by the local party headquarters where we arrive. This is a meeting gift we bring to introduce ourselves, and it is also our great hope that compatriots from all walks of life will give us guidance and recognition. However, China needs aviation construction because some weapons are relics of the previous century and cannot compete with the new weapons of this century for superiority. The recent increase in aircraft ratios in the United States, Russia, Britain, France, Germany, and Japan is even more alarming in quantity. In the international position in the Far East of my country, China, since the September 18th explosion, four provinces have been lost, and the international position has been further reduced. In the future, when the Second World War in 1936 arrives, the country will pray for rain to eliminate disasters</p>
<h3 id="e143">Zhang Tianshi Purified the Altar Last Night <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Today's Official Announcement to Ascend the Altar to Perform Rituals, Calling on All Sectors to Fast and Abstain The philanthropists of this city, Wang Yiting, Xu Guannan, and Shao Ruyi, together with the Buddhist Master Taixu, Jinghai Monk, Quefei Abbot, and others, have launched the "National and Municipal Drought-Stricken Area Prayer for Rain and Disaster Elimination Conference," which will be held on the 20th of this month at Qingliang Temple on Xinzha Road, and Zhang Ruilin, the 63rd generation Tianshi of Sihan, will ascend the altar to pray, etc. The follow-up is as follows,</p>
<h3 id="e144">Cleansing the Altar Last Night <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The conference altar has been completed. It is yellow and colorful, and the smoke from the incense burner surrounds it. The layout is extremely solemn. The association held a purification ceremony last night at 9:00 PM, led by Tianshi Zhang Ruiling and his Dharma friends. Today, they will officially ascend the altar to pray, on the 21st, they will present a memorial, and on the 22nd, the merit will be completed, the talismans will be burned, the gods will be withdrawn, and the altar will be lowered. At the same time, all members of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Puli chanting Buddhist society will also add daily chanting of various scriptures during the prayer period to jointly participate in good deeds.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Publicly Asking for a Fast <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>In order to show sincerity and move the heavens, the association specially issued a declaration, which is recorded as follows: The current year, since the beginning of summer, droughts have wreaked havoc, fire umbrellas have been raised high, and the land has turned red for thousands of miles, regardless of north and south, and including China and foreign countries. It is truly a great calamity for mankind, not just the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. As a result, epidemics are rampant, rice fields are cracked, agricultural production is hopeless, and the disaster is already formed. Colleagues are willing to do their best to pray for the elimination of disasters. A special prayer conference for rain and disaster elimination in Shanghai was launched. The 63rd generation Zhang Tianshi from Longhu Mountain in Jiangxi and the entire membership of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Puli chanting Buddhist society will be respectfully invited to set up an altar for three days at the Xinjia Garden Qingliang Chan Temple on Xinzha Road in this city from the 20th to the 22nd of this month, pray sincerely, in order to move the heavens and rain down early, and eliminate all disasters and epidemics. I sincerely ask all sectors of the country to fast in their residences during these three days, burn incense together, and pray sincerely. I especially hope that the good men and women of this city will come to offer incense early. This is what I hope and pray for. The expenses of this association will be borne by the initiators, and no one will be sent to raise donations from the outside world. A combined statement, I hope that everyone will understand.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Joining Enthusiastically <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Those who have joined the prayer meeting for rain and disaster elimination include the Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, Chu Minyi, the Chaozhou Fellow Villagers Association, Zheng Zhengqiu, Zhou Bangjun, Lou Ziyun, Dong Tianya, Dong Xinyuan, and the Union of more than forty charitable organizations in Shanghai, and there are many devotees, which is particularly commendable.</p>
<p>If China is not prepared to deal with it, then the international position in the Far East will be further reduced, reducing the degree until it is gone. They will follow in the footsteps of Korea and India to become a colony of the powers. This is a tragedy that will soon unfold, and it is also a main reason why the group is walking to your place to shout to compatriots to save the country through aviation. Come, come, come, compatriots, hurry up and take out your wallets to donate money to the government or local governments to buy planes and manufacture planes. Only by preparing new weapons, strengthening our national defense, defending ourselves and others, can China, an old and weak nation, be made youthful and vigorous. Not only can the country be saved, but the homes of our compatriots can also be protected.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Call to Compatriots <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Dear Compatriots from all walks of life across the country, since the 20th century, the progress of material civilization has been developing at a rapid pace, obviously forming a new era, which is the era of scientific competition. In this era, the quality of science is the standard for victory or defeat. Therefore, if a country or a nation wants to survive in today's world, it must engage in scientific competition. The cannons of the imperialist from the "September 18th" Incident awakened us the Chinese nation’s dream, and from now on, everyone understands that this era is the time for small and weak nations to rise up automatically to "save the country and survive." In the face of the covetous eyes of the various imperialist powers, how should we use the fastest and most effective method to resist the aggression of the great powers? Obviously, we must strive to develop the aviation industry, because aviation has the special effect of controlling the aggression of various countries, and it is an important construction suitable for the Chinese environment. During the process of national revolution, Sun Yat-sen also advocated "saving the country through aviation." In national defense, transportation, commerce, agriculture, industry, cultural exchange, social security, bandit suppression, military affairs, and other aspects, aviation can achieve the greatest practical results. Therefore, aviation is really the only way to save the country. In recent years, although the call to save the country through aviation has resounded through the sky, the compatriots in various places have still not been able to deeply understand the significance of saving the country through aviation. In order to awaken all Chinese compatriots to truly understand the significance of saving the country through aviation, and unanimously strive to implement this policy in order to achieve the practical results of saving the country through aviation, it is really necessary to further promote the expanded publicity of saving the country through aviation. In view of this, the group walked around the country to engage in this publicity in order to make the aviation industry increasingly developed, the power to save the country increasingly strengthened, and the policy of saving the country through aviation realized. Dear compatriots from all walks of life, our national humiliation has not been avenged, our lost land has not been recovered, a great disaster is at hand, and the country is in danger. At this time, can we still live in a drunken dream and wait and see? Can we not participate in the movement to resist foreign aggression and save the country as a whole? We must know that aviation is the only weapon for weak countries to defend themselves in the era of scientific competition. The movement to save the country through aviation is a patriotic action of awakened people. It is necessary for all levels of government and the public to work together to participate. Now the group has set off from the capital to promote it. We hope that all compatriots across the country will accept our propaganda with a pure spirit of receiving the country and a united belief in jointly overcoming national difficulties, and will unanimously carry out the work of saving the country through aviation. Our slogans are (1) Expand the strength of the air force, (2) Develop aviation routes, (3) Cultivate aviation talents, (4) Create aviation schools, (5) Promote civil aviation, (6) Encourage aviation manufacturing, (7) Raise funds to establish aircraft factories, (8) Actively donate funds to purchase aircraft, (9) Expand the movement to save the country through aviation.</p>

It was learned yesterday that the factory, recognizing the imminent opening of the Jiangsu Provincial National Products Exhibition and its grand scale and profound significance, has accepted the invitation to participate in the exhibition. The purpose is to increase awareness among the people in various regions. Personnel have already been dispatched to the provincial capital to handle the arrangements.</p>

<h3 id="e149">Expected to be Fully Completed by the End of August <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Trial calls already completed with excellent results, according to the Xin Sheng News Agency. The long-distance telephone service along the Beijing-Shanghai Highway, undertaken by the Ministry of Communications, has been under preparation for some time. Part of the project has already been completed and is scheduled to be officially open for calls. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e150">Section-by-Section Wiring <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications, in anticipation of the opening of the Beijing-Shanghai Highway and to facilitate transportation along the route, is sponsoring the Beijing-Shanghai Highway long-distance telephone service. The route runs from Nanjing, through Jurong, Liyang, Yixing, Wuxi, Changshu, Taicang, Jiading, and Nanxiang, to Shanghai. Since the beginning of preparations, new lines have been added and old lines repaired where existing long-distance telephone poles and lines were present. Otherwise, wooden poles have been erected and new lines strung in sections.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Clear Trial Calls <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>A total of four pairs of open wire and two pairs of phantom circuit lines have been installed along the entire route. The installation has been ongoing for some time. As of yesterday morning, two pairs of open wire and one pair of phantom circuit lines have been completed. The remaining two open wire and one phantom circuit lines are still being laid. It is expected that the entire project will be completed by the end of next month, and official telephone service will be available in September. Trial calls between Nanjing and Shanghai were made the day before yesterday, and the sound quality was very clear. Before the Ministry of Communications sets the rates, long-distance call fees will be charged according to existing rates.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Wenzhou Wired Telegraph</p>
<h3 id="e152">Direct Reporting Started Yesterday <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Takes only three minutes. Wired telegraphs from Shanghai to Wenzhou used to be relayed through Hangzhou and Ningbo, which inevitably caused some delays. In order to facilitate communication between Shanghai and Wenzhou, the Ministry of Communications recently dispatched Mr. Chen Chongde, the chief of the telegraph service of the Hangzhou Electric Administration Bureau, to Ningbo to install a direct telegraph machine, bringing with him the necessary electrical appliances, materials, and motors. It has now been installed and tested for smooth operation. According to a statement by the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau to the Hua Dong News Agency, the telegram service from Shanghai to Wenzhou, after the installation of the new machine in Ningbo, has been able to connect directly since yesterday, taking only three minutes, which is extremely fast.</p>
<p>French Water and Electricity Company</p>
<h3 id="e153">Disguised Price Increase for Water and Electricity <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Citizens request disapproval.</p>
<p>The Second District Branch of the Citizens' United Association of the Second Special District sent a letter to the Board of Directors of the French Concession, which reads: "We hereby inform you that we have received a joint letter from various businesses on the Avenue Edward VII, stating that businesses have been affected by the economic downturn in recent years, the market is sluggish, and business is poor. Closures due to inability to sustain operations are heard of daily. Unexpectedly, at this time when there is no avenue for appeal, we suddenly received a notice in French from the French Water and Electricity Company, stating that starting in July, fees for water and electricity meter installation and deposits would be increased. Upon reading this, we were extremely surprised. Water and electricity are public utilities, and their main purpose is to serve the convenience of the citizens, not like other businesses that can be greedy and insatiable. Moreover, in this time of commercial hardship, water and electricity companies are still making profits of over one million yuan annually, yet they are still not satisfied. They disregard the suffering of the citizens and arbitrarily increase prices in a disguised manner, which is unreasonable and unjust. The Board of Directors of the French Concession, at this time of extreme economic panic and when citizens are feeling extremely burdened, has failed to observe the public sentiment and has rashly approved this increase, which is a disservice to the spirit of cooperation between the authorities and the people. We feel particularly regretful. Businesses are determined not to recognize this unreasonable price increase for water and electricity. We have always admired your association as an organization that seeks welfare for the citizens. Therefore, we are submitting this report and requesting that your association send a letter to the Board of Directors of the French Concession, argue based on reason, and demand the cancellation of this resolution. We will not stop until our goal is achieved, and we pledge our full support. We hope you will not back down even slightly, and we will be extremely grateful." In response to this, after investigation, water and electricity are public utilities, and all actions should be based on the welfare of the citizens. Now, in this time of rural bankruptcy, economic downturn, and the decline of all industries, the French Water and Electricity Company is implementing this disguised price increase, which violates public opinion and disregards the suffering of the citizens, which is highly objectionable. Therefore, we are sending this letter on behalf of the citizens and requesting that your bureau consider the difficulties of the times, uphold the spirit of cooperation, and consider the suffering of the citizens. Please promptly revoke the approval of this unreasonable price increase to avoid causing resentment among the citizens and creating unnecessary disputes. We hope you will investigate.</p>
<p>Shanghai Telephone Bureau</p>
<h3 id="e154">Submitted to the Ministry of Communications for Approval to Establish a Minhang Telephone Bureau <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The downtown branch will be completed in early September. The number of users in the Nanshi area has increased sharply, and there are plans to expand and establish a bureau in Minhang. The Minhang District Telephone Bureau was originally operated by local merchants. Last year, Shanghai County requested that the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications take over the operation. The bureau submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications and dispatched Mr. Yu Bingjian, the chief engineer of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, to investigate. It was deemed that telephones are related to the prosperity of the market, and in order to promote commerce in the area, a telephone bureau should be established. The Shanghai Telephone Bureau is now raising funds and will begin purchasing equipment and laying lines as soon as the funds are available.</p>
<p>As for the downtown telephone branch, since construction began in May, most of the project has been completed. According to Mr. Yu Bingjian, the chief engineer, to the Xin Sheng News Agency yesterday, the completion date will be extended to early September. As for the date of service, lines must be laid and 150 telephone sets installed, which will be completed by the end of this year.</p>
<p>Expansion of Lines: Due to the sharp increase in the number of users in the Nanshi District, the existing lines are gradually becoming insufficient. To provide convenience for users, the bureau is now planning to expand, which will require approximately 30,000 yuan in materials and funds. The funds are currently being raised. As for the No. 0 switchboard connecting to the concessions, it will also be expanded in the near future due to the sharp increase in calls.</p>

<h3 id="e155">Resolution of the Dispute Over the Purchase of Rice by a Cook <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Squad leader Qian Jihua is being strictly investigated. Platoon leader Bu Wenbin has been demoted. The Heshang Rice Store on Dayang Bridge in Zhabei and the Second Platoon of the Second Regiment of the Security Department had a dispute over the purchase of rice, which led to a strike. After the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, together with representatives from all sectors of Zhabei, persuaded them to resume business, the Municipal Security Department also investigated the matter and imposed punishments. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e156">Handling Measures <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Security Department sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday, which reads: "We have received your Chamber's official letters No. 15, 17, and 23, regarding the case of the dispute between the Heshang Rice Store on Dayang Bridge and the Second Platoon of our Department's Second Regiment over the purchase of rice. You requested that we investigate and severely punish the parties involved in order to maintain commerce and reassure the people. We have approved this request. After investigating this case, our department received reports from the Second Regiment and complaints from the Heshang Rice Store. We directly dispatched personnel to conduct a thorough investigation and submit a factual report. After considering all the circumstances and making a fair judgment, we have determined that Squad Leader Qian Jihua acted without authorization and violated military discipline, and deserves punishment. The rice store did not follow proper business practices and rashly provoked the dispute, and is also at fault and cannot evade responsibility. On the 9th of this month, Zhang Lianyu, a cook from the Second Platoon, purchased two dou of rice from the rice store and asked the Sen Tai Store, where they usually deposit dough, to weigh it for him. He found that it was short by twelve liang. The cook took the rice back to the rice store to request compensation. The rice store, accustomed to disrespecting small customers, arrogantly insulted him, poured the rice into a bucket, threw back the payment, and verbally abused the cook. The cook, feeling wronged, returned to the platoon to report the incident. The soldiers were outraged by the arrogance of the rice store. Chen Zhichao, the duty platoon leader, did not fully believe the cook's one-sided account and ordered the duty squad leader, Qian Jihua, to invite the store owner to the platoon to inquire about the situation in order to ascertain the truth. However, the store owner refused to go, and the squad leader resorted to coercion, resulting in a physical altercation. Jiang Dianle, the patrol officer of the Fourth District, arrived after hearing the news to mediate. Bu Wenbin, the platoon leader of the platoon, also returned to the platoon from outside at that time and immediately apologized to the patrol officer and the rice store owner, and offered them tea and water before leaving. He then reprimanded the squad leader for violating the duty platoon leader's order to invite the store owner to the platoon to ask questions peacefully, and abusing his authority. The squad leader was detained pending further action. This is the actual situation of the incident on that day, which our department has investigated several times and found to be true. The rice store's shortage of weight can be proven by the signed statement of Jin Gensheng, the owner of the Sen Tai Store who weighed the rice for the cook. Platoon Leader Bu Wenbin's apology and hospitality to the rice store owner was witnessed by Patrol Officer Jiang Dianle. In all fairness, Squad Leader Qian Jihua acted beyond his authority and deserves to be condemned. The rice store's unfair transaction led to the incident, and both parties are unfortunate, which our department deeply regrets. Our department has always regarded merchants and soldiers as one, and military discipline is especially strict. Any soldier who commits a fault will be punished to the fullest extent of the law, and we will never tolerate any misconduct. We have now reported to the Municipal Government and will transfer the squad leader to our department for strict investigation and punishment in accordance with military law. As for Platoon Leader Bu Wenbin, his handling of the situation at the time was not inappropriate. However, the actions of his soldiers dared to exceed the scope of his orders. He is responsible for his usual neglect of education and cannot escape blame. He is hereby demoted to lieutenant as a minor punishment and will be retained in his original position to observe his future performance. In conclusion, harmony and goodwill should be the main principles between the military and the people. Our department will learn from the past and be wary of the future, and will strictly restrain our subordinates. Any offense will be punished. We also hope that merchants and the people will respect public morals and conduct fair transactions, so that all grievances can be eliminated and everyone can live in peace."</p>
<h3 id="e157">Chamber of Commerce's Attitude <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>In addition to sending a letter to the Chamber of Commerce regarding the handling of the case, the Municipal Security Department also sent Secretary Hou Dachun to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to explain the details of the investigation and discuss solutions. He was received by Secretary Yan Ersheng of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. After discussions, both parties expressed their willingness to handle the case fairly. The Chamber of Commerce believed that the Security Department's punishment of Duty Squad Leader Qian Jihua and the demotion of Platoon Leader Bu Wenbin showed Director Yang's concern for commerce and impartiality.

<p>Ministry of Finance Approves Chamber of Commerce Request</p>
<h3 id="e159">Extend the Validity Period of National Seafood Permits <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Whether imported or domestic, the validity period is one year. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the Shanghai Seafood and Groceries Trade Association, stating that the validity period of permits for domestic razor clams, wood ear mushrooms, shiitake mushrooms, dried shrimp, and other items was shorter than that of imported goods, hindering transportation and sales. The Chamber telegraphed the Ministry of Finance requesting that the validity period be the same as that of imported goods, i.e., one year. It has now been learned that the Ministry of Finance approved the Chamber's request yesterday, allowing the validity period to be the same as that of imported goods. The original text is as follows: "We have received your telegram and have instructed the Inspector General of Customs to instruct the Jianghai Customs to investigate. All razor clams, wood ear mushrooms, shiitake mushrooms, dried shrimp, and other items are regarded by the Customs as items that cannot be stored for too long. Whether imported or domestic, the validity period of the permits used is set at less than one year. Now, considering the business situation, the Jianghai Customs has revised the validity period of permits for razor clams and other items to one year to facilitate transportation and sales. Please inform them."</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Letter to the Finance Bureau</p>
<h3 id="e160">Request to Postpone the Increase in Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Collect according to the amount handled by the Ministry</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce received a petition from over fifty representatives, including Chen Liangyu of the Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Trade Association, Zhu Liwu of the Restaurant Trade Association, Lan Qinghe of the Sauce and Wine Store Association, Li Bingen of the Western Tobacco Trade Association, and Yang Qiaosheng and Liao Zhongwen of the Fen Wine Trade Association, stating that after the license tax was transferred to the city's administration, the increased tax amount was unbearable. They specifically went to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to petition and forward the petition to the mayor, ordering a postponement of the tax increase to avoid disputes, etc. The chairman of the Chamber, Yu Zuoting, and Secretary Yan Ersheng, received the petition, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Municipal Finance Bureau yesterday, requesting a temporary postponement of the tax increase and to collect according to the amount handled by the Ministry. The original text is as follows: (Omitted above) "Although the Provisional Regulations on Tobacco and Alcohol Business Licenses were promulgated by the Ministry in the twentieth year of the Republic of China, merchants and people have been requesting amendments to them to this day. Therefore, when the Ministry handled it, it took into account the facts and did not collect the full amount according to the regulations, which can be proven by the facts. Since the Shanghai business market has experienced the anti-Japanese war and the world economic recession, it has been in a state of decline. In particular, the tobacco exchange industry is known as the "husband and wife shop," and it is difficult to compare it with ordinary stores. When the Ministry handled it, it took into account the difficulties of the merchants. Since it is now handled by the city, it is better to increase the actual revenue than before, which is not the way to benefit merchants and the people. Moreover, the reform of the tobacco and alcohol license tax to local control was originally intended to compensate for the harsh and miscellaneous taxes. Since there are no harsh and miscellaneous taxes that can be cut in this city, it is purely an increase in revenue rather than compensation. It is even more possible to collect according to the number of collections handled by the Ministry to promote tolerance. According to the letter's previous situation, we hereby request that your bureau investigate and approve that it still be handled according to the old precedent, with the old exchanged for the new, which is indeed a public friendship."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association convened the 173rd joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees at its clubhouse at the intersection of Rue de Belles and Avenue Lafayette in the French Concession at 7:00 PM last night.

<h3 id="e162">Except for Yantai and Five-Star Brands <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>All others are imitations of domestic products. Domestic Yantai beer is made with spring water and is of fine quality and mellow taste, which has been unanimously recognized by compatriots across the country. However, inferior goods have been flooding the market recently, and most of them are changed labels. Some use the names of domestic products and use advertising to deceive Chinese people. Therefore, the company specifically joined forces with Five-Star Beer to publish an announcement in the newspaper to make Chinese people aware that the real domestic beer is only Yantai and Five-Star, and the rest are either foreign goods or changed labels. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has ordered all provinces and cities to pay close attention. It is hoped that people who love domestic products will have a deep understanding of the real domestic Yantai beer and promote it unanimously, so that they can reduce leakage and save rights.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Domestic Products Promotion Overseas is Gradually Becoming Active <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Various countries are willing to be agents. American businessmen also promote our country's exquisite domestic products to Nanyang. The domestic products are extremely rich, but because various countries implement tariff barriers, it is impossible to promote them, so the foreign market only supplies raw materials and there is no room for sales of manufactured products. Recently, because our country has eliminated export tariffs and the National Foreign Trade Bureau has made efforts to promote overseas, many import and export merchants from various countries have come to China to purchase: (1) Lundon Lunfu Brothers Company of London purchased a large number of novel goods and sundries to transport to England to be agents for buying and selling; (2) The Paris Plaster Company of London requires a large amount of wheat straw for manufacturing purposes; (3) A certain American rubber company purchased soybean flour; (4) Silu Company of Siam purchased a large number of light bulbs, electric fans, electric heaters, and other electrical materials; (5) American Shi Pankushi carried more than 150 kinds of domestic products to Nanyang, India, Europe and the United States for promotion, and has shipped them out of the country today.</p>

<h3 id="e166">Retrial Record of the Liu Chongwu Case <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Liu and others did not admit to premeditated murder. The prosecutor asked the presiding judge to leniently sentence. The debate was concluded yesterday and the sentence will be pronounced on the 26th. In the winter of the year before last, the Maotai Foreign Goods Store on Xinzha Road, the Yuheng Foreign Goods Store on Hankou Road, the Sunkwang Hing Clock Store on Henan Road, as well as Maotai, Xinmingxing, and other foreign goods stores, were selling inferior goods. After Liu Chongwu, a member of the Anti-Japanese War Veterans Blood Soul Elimination Group who participated in the Anti-Japanese War, sent letters of warning one after another, they still did not realize. Liu and others made further arrangements, and Wang Zhengtao, the manager of Maotai, and Wang Yirong, the employee of Yuheng Store, were sacrificed under the guns. Xie Bintai was also injured by the bombing when he went to the Sunkwang Hing Store. Later, Liu Chongwu, Pan Hongsheng, Cao Songsou, and Tian Shuiyang were arrested by the police and found with guns and bullets, etc. They were sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and conviction. However, the police believed that the sentence was too light, so they appealed to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. After the court concluded the trial, the</p>
<h3 id="e167">Original Verdict Was Reversed <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Liu, Pan, and Cao were each sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment, and Tian Shuiyang was sentenced to six years. Liu and others were also dissatisfied and appealed to the Supreme Court. The groups in this city also felt that Liu and others were subject to legal punishment because of sanctions against traitors, which made the patriotic movement feel cold, so they appealed everywhere to try to rescue them. Recently, the Supreme Court has rendered a verdict on the case and sent it back to the Second Branch of the High Court for retrial. The groups re-engaged lawyers for defense. Yesterday morning, Yu, the chief judge of the criminal court of the Second Branch of the High Court, and Jiang and Zhou, the judges, specially opened a collegial panel and ordered the four people to be interrogated from the western prison. First, the police lawyer retold the case and the arrest of the defendants. Judge Yu then interrogated the four defendants Liu Pan Caotian</p>
<h3 id="e168">Repeated Interrogation <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Liu and others did not admit to the crime of premeditated murder, saying that the purpose of going to the stores at that time was to warn the traitors, and there was no intention of killing or injuring people. The bombs and guns they carried were only intended to scare them. As for the shooting of Wang Zhengtao, it was caused by the accidental firing of the gun. The death of Wang Yirong was also caused by Wang suddenly trying to hold the hand of Liu Chongwu, who was holding a gun, from behind, causing the trigger to be touched, and the bullet shot out, killing Wang Yirong. Xie Bintai's injury was due to Xie not leaving immediately. The court then ordered the start of the debate, and the police lawyer spoke first, stating that the four defendants in this case committed the crime of premeditated murder, attempted murder, and obstructing the freedom of others. The defendants had already confessed to these crimes in the police station and led the detectives to perform at the scene of the incident.</p>
<h3 id="e169">The Shape of Disaster <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>When they were arrested, guns and bullets were found, which was a true and deserved crime. The only reason why the Supreme Court sent it back for retrial was whether it was premeditated. Although the statements of the defendants were not completely consistent, the inconsistencies were all minor, and the general agreement was the same. The Supreme Court considered that the statements of the defendants were slightly different, and it was not unreasonable to believe that there was a suspicion of premeditation. It should be requested to maintain the second instance judgment, etc. The four lawyers of the defendant, Ma, Zhang, Li, and Yu, defended in turn. Ma argued based on the facts of the case, Zhang focused on legal principles, and quoted</p>
<h3 id="e170">Tang Liu Zongyuan <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>An article refuting the theory of revenge was used as a textual research for this case. The lawyers Li and Yu said that the defendants were acting out of righteous indignation and were not comparable to personal enmity. The conclusion was that they did not constitute premeditated murder, but only a kind of negligent act. They requested that the defendants be declared innocent, and even if they were considered guilty, they should be given special pardon and probation. Finally, Prosecutor Zhong rose to argue and asked the presiding judge to leniently sentence them. Judge Yu concluded the debate and announced that the sentence would be pronounced on the morning of the 26th of this month. The four people, Liu and others, were taken back to the Western prison by the Chinese and Western detectives for detention.</p>

<h3 id="e171">Improving Chinese Bookkeeping <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>The joint training course is now open for registration. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and accountant Xu Yongzuo have strongly promoted the movement to improve Chinese bookkeeping in recent years. Last December, the Chamber of Commerce held a large-scale lecture and exhibition, which set a new record for attendance and viewership. Recently, there are plans to jointly organize an improved Chinese bookkeeping training course. It is reported that this plan has become concrete and that registration will be open simultaneously at the Chamber of Commerce and Xu Accountant Firm starting today. All matters concerning education and training will be jointly overseen by accountant Xu Yongzuo and Yan Esheng, the president of a commercial school. The rationale and detailed rules of the improved Chinese bookkeeping training course are recorded below:</p>
<p>Rationale: The current bookkeeping methods in our country can be broadly divided into Chinese and Western styles. Western bookkeeping uses horizontal registration, relying on imported paper and ink, and the accounting principles and methods are rigidly adhering to Western practices. Not only is it difficult to imitate, but it is also very costly. Chinese bookkeeping uses vertical recording, with paper and ink all being domestic goods. The accounting principles and methods are familiar to Chinese people. However, the system is not perfect and lacks organization, which is not aligned with the purpose of accounting. Therefore, it is also criticized. I, as an accountant, have served the community for many years and have been concerned about the inadequacies of the current bookkeeping system. I have launched a movement to improve Chinese bookkeeping, giving lectures at various universities and writing articles in various magazines, advocating for improving Chinese bookkeeping based on our country's inherent system and adopting the latest world academic principles, using the most economical and effective methods. The news spread, which has aroused the sympathy of the academic and business circles. Since last year, after publishing a special book with concrete plans and explanations for improving Chinese bookkeeping, it has aroused the attention of the entire society, and discussions and adoption have been widespread. It can be seen that improving Chinese bookkeeping has gone from advocacy to implementation. Last winter, the Chamber of Commerce, in view of the importance of improved Chinese bookkeeping, held a large-scale exhibition and lecture, publicly exhibiting the ledgers, books, charts, and tables of improved Chinese bookkeeping. I, the accountant, also attended and lectured, and tens of thousands of attendees praised it. At that time, the audience requested more detailed lectures and the establishment of a special training class for long-term study. However, due to busy duties, it has not been possible to hold it. In the past year, the adoption of improved Chinese bookkeeping has become increasingly popular, and the effectiveness has become increasingly apparent, and requests to open training courses have become more frequent. From far away, such as Shaanxi, Sichuan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and the South Seas Islands, and nearby, such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Jiangxi, and Anhui, letters are often received requesting correspondence courses. This shows that improving bookkeeping is universally supported, and opening a training class cannot be delayed any longer. Therefore, the Chamber of Commerce and I, the accountant, have jointly formulated regulations to hold a large-scale training course to teach the accounting principles and methods of improved Chinese bookkeeping. Every morning, during spare time, a one-hour lecture will be held at the Chamber of Commerce's assembly hall, adopting strict training, and charging a very small fee, with the aim of completing the study in two months, ensuring that students can obtain a comprehensive understanding and skills of improved Chinese bookkeeping after graduation, and serve the community, being able to perform their duties with ease. All accounting personnel of companies and firms, or those who aspire to study improved Chinese bookkeeping, regardless of gender or age, can apply for admission according to the admission requirements. Companies and firms that need to train their accounting personnel to improve their bookkeeping can also send them to study, which is an excellent opportunity to study improved Chinese bookkeeping.

<p>It Rained Again Yesterday in This City</p>
<h3 id="e172">The Weather Turned Cooler After a Short Time <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>The weather in this city has been very dry. Although the two rains on the afternoon and evening of the day before yesterday (the 17th) did not help agricultural work at all, the weather has turned slightly cooler. Starting yesterday morning, the sky was covered with dark clouds, indicating that it would continue to rain. As expected, at about 8 o'clock, the overcast sky closed in, with intermittent showers. However, it stopped after about ten minutes, with the rainfall being heavier near Nanshi, while only a few drops fell in Zhabei. At about 1:30 PM, there was another drizzle, which lasted for about ten minutes. At about 2 o'clock, it rained again, although the raindrops were slightly larger than before, it also stopped after only ten minutes. Afterwards, there was a cool breeze, which refreshed the mind. Compared with the temperature more than ten days ago, it was like heaven and earth.</p>
<p>The Weather Is Unseasonal</p>
<h3 id="e173">The Number of Epidemic Patients Has Increased Sharply <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>There is also the possibility of finding true cholera. The heat in this city has decreased after the rain seen on the current day (the 17th), but the rainfall time was very short and the amount of rain was especially scarce. On the rural side, the benefit is very shallow. Although it still rained from time to time yesterday, due to the sudden rain and sunshine, the nitrogenous climate has changed drastically, and the ground emits a turbid smell that makes people want to vomit. As a result, the epidemic has increased sharply. A Datong News Agency reporter visited the emergency epidemic hospital on North Xizang Road last night and learned from the female doctor Qin Meixian of the hospital that 58 patients were admitted from morning to dusk yesterday, all suffering from gastroenteritis, which is the highest record since the hospital opened. If the weather remains unstable, there is a possibility that true cholera may be discovered, she said. Now we will explore the number of outpatients in the hospital since it opened on the 9th of this month.</p>
<p>The total number of outpatients is 841, and the number of inpatients is 364. An ambulance is dispatched every day to patrol various places in Zhabei. When a patient is found, they are immediately carried onto the ambulance and sent to the hospital for emergency treatment. Therefore, the hospital's protection of epidemic patients is meticulous.</p>
<p>A Worker Was Frightened by Gunfire</p>
<h3 id="e174">Fell into the River and Drowned <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>The foreman filed a lawsuit against the security team members, and the district court opened the trial to investigate. Coal workers at the Baotai Silk Factory in Xicaoge Temple, Longhua Town, had a dispute over work on the afternoon of June 8. The Ninth District Party Headquarters there heard about it and, fearing a major disaster, immediately notified the Longhua Town Security Team. Team leader Wu Shougang ordered team members Tang Zuxian, Wu Fusheng, Wu Yinxiang, Hu Youcai, etc., to go to suppress the dispute. Unexpectedly, the team members encountered the workers on the way, and it is unknown how they caused trouble for the security team members. The team members, for the sake of self-defense, fired several shots into the sky to get rid of the workers. After the incident, foreman Hu Yude filed a complaint with the prosecutor's office of the District Court against the security team members for firing guns, stating that worker Qi Desheng was carrying coal and was suddenly frightened by the gunfire and fell into the river and drowned, and that his body was missing, etc., and named Lan Yongqing, who was carrying the coal with Qi Desheng, as a witness. Prosecutor Wu Derong ordered an investigation with a thousand witnesses, and at the end of the investigation, a public prosecution was filed, stating that the defendants should be prosecuted for the murder case, and listing the facts of the defendants' crimes, the reasons for the prosecution, and the criminal provisions. The reason for this is that Wu Shoukang, Tang Liangen, and Ji Xiaomao (that is, Ji Wenbin) knew each other. At 2:00 PM on June 8, Tang Liangen</p>
<p>Hu Yude quarreled over contracting coal carrying, and Wu Shoukang sent team members Wu Youcai, Wu Yinxiang, Tang Zuxian, Wu Fusheng, etc. to arrest Hu Yude's workers and threaten them with guns. At that time, Song Yongqing and Qi Desheng were carrying coal on their shoulders and were on the springboard when they were frightened by the sound of gunfire and fell into the water. Qi Desheng drowned and disappeared. The reason for Hu Yude's lawsuit is that the facts mentioned above in the prosecution and the criminal provisions were interrogated by Wu Shoukang, Tang Liangen, and Ji Xiaomao, who denied the allegations. However, Hu Yude and Song Yongqing clearly stated the details, and Wang Qishan, Wang Fushan, and Mao Chunfu also testified that they did hear Hu Yude's workers being frightened by the gunfire and falling into the water, and that they were not rescued. Wu Shoukang also did not deny sending team members to threaten with guns. It is obvious that the statements of Wu Shoukang, Tang Liangen, and Ji Xiaomao are sophistry. Wu Shoukang, Tang Liangen, Ji Xiaomao, Wu Youcai, Wu Yinxiang, Tang Zuxian, and Wu Fusheng clearly committed the crime under Article 291 of the Criminal Law, etc. The day before yesterday, Judge Zhang Peiming opened the trial. The defendants hired lawyers Pan Zhensheng and Zhu Fang to appear in court to defend them. According to Hu Yude, he is from Shanyang, and the deceased, Kai Desheng, still has an uncle in his hometown. Except for Wu Yinxiang, who did not arrive due to illness, the defendants all arrived as summoned. According to Wu Shoukang, he was notified by the Shanxi Party Headquarters to send personnel to suppress the dispute. However, an investigation revealed that no one had fallen into the water and drowned. The judge stated that the case was important and that there was a need for further investigation, and that the trial would continue.</p>

<p>The China Jiande Association table tennis team suffered great damage to its reputation due to illegal refereeing by the Xiangbin Cup table tennis tournament organizing committee, and filed a lawsuit with the First Special Court requesting confirmation that the illegal verdict was invalid. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang Qinglan of the First Special Court opened a hearing, and the plaintiff Lu Xiu lawyer, accompanied by the lawyers Yang Ruinian, E Sen, and Yin Jingxian, and the defendant Zhi Lu Xi Niao, accompanied by lawyers Jiang Yiping and Wu Baotai, appeared in court. First, Lu Xiu lawyer stated that he was the captain of the Jiande table tennis team. The team participated in the Xiangbin Cup table tennis tournament hosted by the defendant, and the result was that the team and the Guangdong team each scored 17 points. The defendant then set the final on May 19 at the Meifeng table tennis room, but on the 19th, the team suddenly received a letter from the defendant, notifying them of a change of date. The reason was that the Guangdong team believed that the venue was too small and requested a change of date. Although the team was fully prepared, they had to comply and not go. Subsequently, the period for the selection of Chinese athletes to prepare for the Far East Games with the Japanese team was combined. The team participated because of the great significance and honor of winning glory for the country. The order was announced daily, and the order announced on the 26th showed that most of the players from the Jiande and Guangdong teams had pre-selected orders. Therefore, they had no choice but to jointly request a postponement in accordance with Article 7, Paragraph 5 of the Xiangbin Cup tournament regulations, but the defendant replied that it was not allowed. It was already the competition period, and there was only one hour left, so they could not attend. The referee Zhou Weixin ruled that the team had forfeited the match and was ranked second. Unexpectedly, the defendant abandoned the referee's verdict and further ruled that the team had withdrawn halfway, and the scores were completely cancelled and not counted, and also published articles attacking the team wantonly, causing great damage to its reputation. Therefore, they requested confirmation that the verdict was invalid, etc. Zhi Lu Xi Niao stated that the final on the 26th had been notified long ago, but the plaintiff did not request a postponement in advance, but sent a letter requesting it on the same day</p>
<p>The Whole Story of the Plotting and Rioting of Bandits in Pudong</p>
<p>Zhu Alan's Various Crimes Zhu Shaoqing Was Originally a Military Advisor. The case of the robbers occurring in the area of Lujiada Bridge in the west of Zhangjiang Wang Town, Pudong, resulting in the death of the escorted bandit Zhu Alan, was briefly reported in yesterday's newspaper. Now we will explore the detailed circumstances of the case and continue to record them as follows. First of all, the bandit Zhu Alan was a native of Qinjia Town in the Fourth District of Nanhui. He had been associated with bandits and was sentenced to 12 years in prison by the county government for illegally possessing military fire in the years 7 and 8 of the Republic of China. During the time of Sun Chuanfang's army's arrival in Shanghai, he took the opportunity to escape. In the 13th year of the Republic of China, he ganged up with Hong Xiangtao and others to destroy the Western Bridge at No. 31 Huhan Road to plot trouble. Later, Hong Xiangtao was sentenced to death, while Zhu escaped without a trace. In the 14th year of the Republic of China, he robbed the home of Xu Zhuchun in the east of Qinjia Town. In the spring of the 16th year, he raped Tang Wu, a resident of Qinjia Town, and severely beat her husband Tang Chatao, causing permanent disability. Mr. Tang is still alive today,</p>
<h3 id="e176">And Hates Them Deeply. <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>In the 17th year of the Republic of China, he ganged up to kidnap the old mother of Chen Deyi near Chenjiahang, Shanghai County, and was sentenced to imprisonment again. In the 18th year of the Republic of China, Wang Boxiang's house in Luotuo Temple was robbed twice, all under his instigation. In the 20th year of the Republic of China, although Zhu escaped in the case of the robbery of Lin Linquan's home in Linjiaquan, his henchman Tang Jincai is still in prison. In the 22nd year of the Republic of China, he instigated the robbery of Zhang Agui's home in Xisong Bridge. In summary, the bandit has committed countless crimes throughout his life. However, most of the victims dare not speak out because his party members are fierce and for the sake of their own livelihoods. Although he has been sentenced to imprisonment several times, he has always relied on his capable henchmen and made every effort to rescue him, avoiding death. In the summer of this year, Nanhui County Magistrate Yuan Xiluo received a secret report stating that Zhu Alan had opened a teahouse, gathered scum, sold prohibited drugs, and colluded with the communists to</p>
<h3 id="e177">Transfer Military Fire, <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>etc., and secretly ordered the Zhangjiang Fence Public Security Bureau to arrest him within a time limit. After receiving the order, Director Sun of the Branch Bureau dispatched officers to track him down day and night, and finally intercepted him on the afternoon of the 16th in the Sanjieqiao area near Beicai. He immediately found suspicious letters on his person and detained him at the fence. After a preliminary interrogation, his language was cunning and he firmly denied the allegations. Therefore, on the evening of the 17th, he dispatched Inspector Gan and a police officer, and also requested two members from the security team for assistance. He also hired a net boat in advance, because the weather was dry and the water was shallow, and the inland river could not carry passengers. He instructed them to drive the empty boat to Lujiada Bridge and wait. Because the bandit had many henchmen and was afraid of being noticed, he escorted the bandit Zhu Alan at about 10 o'clock in the evening, armed with four team police, intending to take the boat at Lujiada Bridge. He was familiar with the road and arrived a few hundred steps away from Lujiada Bridge. Dozens of gunshots suddenly rang out in the nearby fields. The two team members were startled and</p>

<p>The gunfire from the other side suddenly became dense. The bandit Zhu Alan suddenly broke free, turned around and tried to snatch the firearm from the inspector's hand, and shouted loudly, intending to meet the other side. The patrolman blew his whistle madly and ran back to report. The escorting team police fired their guns to resist, repelling the would-be robbers. For a moment, bullets rained down, and the bandit Zhu Alan was shot dead by stray bullets. The town police were on their way out to defend when they received the report and immediately went to assist, tracking down the robbers in all directions, but they had all disappeared far away. They then returned to defend in different directions and did not leave all night. The merchants and residents of the entire town and the nearby villagers were all extremely frightened. The district team bureau urgently reported to the county government after the incident</p>
<h3 id="e179">To Verify the Bandit's Corpse. <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>And at noon on the 18th, gathered all the town police, together with the local villager Deputy Shen Shaoshan, went to Qin Town Bandit's Nest to search for the remaining bandits. He arrested Zhu Shaoqing, Zhu Alan's brother, in the teahouse, and found letters, bullets, and other items in his home. He was over half a hundred years old and resourceful. Most of the cases Zhu Alan committed were his schemes, so the bandits regarded him as a military advisor. It is now reported that the Public Security Branch Bureau, in view of the previous case, intends to request the county government to send a water patrol team to the district to take custody of the suspect, and on the other hand, order each jia to continue special martial law from the night of the 18th to prevent any further accidents.</p>
<p>Request, because they were fully prepared, so their request was not allowed. As for the referee, he was hired by the association, and the highest authority was the association, so the association had the right to change the referee's verdict, etc. Lawyer Yang Ruinian then stated that according to the rules of sports, the referee is the highest authority in any competition, and all team members and spectators must absolutely obey. However, the tournament regulations did not explicitly stipulate that the organizing committee could change the referee's verdict, which was illegal, etc. The court stated that the facts were clear and ordered the debate to begin. After the lawyers on both sides debated with each other, Judge Zhang declared the debate concluded and scheduled the judgment to be announced on the morning of the 24th.</p>

<p>Sentenced to Two Years of Imprisonment For Fraud. Wang Lizhong, a well-known swindling gang leader from Ningbo, defrauded Bao Jintai, the manager of the Tongchang Grocery Store at No. 12 Dasheng Lane, Xiaodongmen, out of 1,500 yuan in banknotes using fraudulent gambling methods on the 4th and 5th of this month in Room 513 of the Grand Shanghai Hotel on Dajin Road. The Laozao Police Station was reported and ordered Detective Bu Zongting to arrest Wang. The police station lawyer Zhang Shizhu prosecuted Wang in the First Special Court in accordance with Article 363 of the Criminal Law. The details of the trial have been detailed in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhan Liangce of the Second Criminal Court announced the verdict, sentencing Wang Lizhong to two years of imprisonment. The number of days of pre-trial detention will be used to offset one day of imprisonment for every two days.</p>

<p>Carry Your Certificate to the Vehicle Affairs Office on Minli Road, Zhabei Before the 20th of This Month. The Shanghai Rickshaw Industry Association Special Zone Office issued an emergency notice yesterday stating, "Regarding the matter of emergency notice, this office received an order from the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities on July 16th stating, 'It has been found that the registration of the true names of the owners of operating rickshaws at your office has expired, and there are still more than 2,000 unregistered vehicles, which is very inappropriate. However, considering the hot weather these days, we will allow the extension to July 20th. You are hereby notified.' In addition to distributing the notice, we are afraid that it will not be fully known, so we will publish it again in the newspaper. We hope that all members will immediately inform all rickshaw owners that all operating vehicles that have not yet been registered with the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities must carry the certificates issued by this office to the Vehicle Affairs Office on Minli Road, Zhabei before July 20th for registration to prove and comply with the official order. The matter concerns the existence and abolition of business and is very important. Do not delay any longer and cause great damage to yourself. If there are any delays or overdue dates, and other problems occur, this office will not be responsible. This is hereby notified." Zhabei</p>

<p>Due to the drastic drop in the exchange rate of copper coins and the rise in gasoline prices on the 22nd of this month, the public transportation industry in the city has suffered greatly. Electric vehicles in the concessions have already increased their prices. The Zhabei Chinese Public Bus Company has also been affected by the depreciation of copper coins, and it is said that the monthly deficit is more than 4,000 yuan. Therefore, it applied to the authorities for an increase in fares to maintain operations. It has now been approved and will be implemented on the 22nd of this month. Except for the special bus from North Station to Jinan University on Route 3, the fare for the entire line remains unchanged at 20 cents. For the remaining buses, one copper coin will be added for the first and second stops, and two copper coins will be added for each stop starting from the third stop. The new price list is as follows: Route 1: 9 to 35 copper coins for the entire line; Route 3: 9 to 50 copper coins; Route 4: 9 to 47 copper coins from North Station to the Municipal Government (North Neilu); The extended section of the Municipal Government to the Municipal Government Staff Dormitory is a temporary operation, and the fare remains at 12 copper coins.</p>

<p>According to the Japanese Shanghai Daily, 15 people who caused disturbances on Zha Pu Road who were detained by the Japanese Consulate General some time ago have now been investigated and clarified. Among them, 12 have been detained for seven days and released, and the remaining three have been banned from staying in Shanghai and deported. However, after the incident occurred, the authorities received the support of the Public Works Department police, and a very strict cordon was set up, which was effective. However, the patrol team has been reduced from two teams to one team, which will inevitably lead to lax security. However, more attention will be paid to those who seek pleasure at night.</p>
<p>Public Works Department</p>
<h3 id="e184">Health Report for June <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>The Director of the Health Department of the Public Works Department reported for the month of June, "Except for the lack of rain, the weather was generally normal this month. However, starting on the 25th, it suddenly turned very hot. Fortunately, the transmission of Liang disease did not increase as a result. There were only 6,000 cases of heatstroke, and the number of deaths was not high.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Increased Work <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Due to the arrival of the hot season, the workload of the Health Department has increased, especially the management of retail cold drinks, which is difficult. Among them, many are unreliable. The enforcement work of the Health Department will be effective if it receives the cooperation and attention of the public. However, diseases caused by cold drinks have not been seen much. However, there are more patients with typhoid fever, which may be related to this.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Key Points for Disease Prevention <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>The public should pay more attention to whether their own kitchens, basements, and toilets are clean in the summer. The key to preventing disease is to be careful with food. Although this is a very trivial matter, one must not shirk the labor. Also, if servants are sick, one should pay close attention to them, lest they spread it to the whole family.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Well Disinfection <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Cholera was not found in June. However, disinfectants were placed in the wells as usual. The Waterworks Company has agreed to provide free water in the poor areas, which has been implemented since June 28th. Recently, many residents near the water wells have volunteered to disinfect them, so the personnel performing the task can use this to know the location of the wells. This change in attitude is a very gratifying thing.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Cholera Prevention <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Cholera prevention work is proceeding as usual. Because the Municipal Government is holding the 13th Health and Cleaning Movement, the Health Department is cooperating and stepping up publicity. A total of 55,299 people were injected this month. In terms of population, this number seems too small. However, those who are injected are all voluntary, and the general habit of people is not to take preventive measures until after the infection has been discovered. However, it is often too late.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Comparison of Births and Deaths <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>The number of bathers in outdoor swimming pools reached 18,279, which is almost double that of June last year. Therefore, the number of supervisors had to be increased. This month's population births, as reported, were 51 foreigners and 193 Chinese. The mortality rate was 10.94 per thousand for foreigners and 12.81 per thousand for Chinese, which are both quite low compared to the historical average for June.</p>

This was forwarded to the Nanchang Headquarters of the Chairman of the Military Commission for review, and approval was granted. Now we have received a telegram from Chairman Chiang stating, 'We have learned of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce's request to issue regulations for the sale of medicinal anesthetics, which was submitted by your department last month. We have just telegraphed the Executive Yuan to order the Department of Health to prepare for implementation in accordance with the currently issued Regulations on the Management of Anesthetics in order to fundamentally resolve the issue. At the same time, we have also instructed Director Liu Ruiheng to send personnel to Shanghai in conjunction with the Anti-Smoking Supervisory Office of this Headquarters to negotiate and formulate a temporary solution to provide temporary relief during the preparation period for the implementation of the management regulations. This is specially telegraphed for your information.' " Accordingly, we hereby notify you to investigate and comply.</p>

<h3 id="e191">Benefit from Using Domestic Glycerin <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>The Xingqiu (Planet) brand glycerin, created by Chinese people, is of excellent quality and reasonably priced. Since the lifting of tariffs, its sales have been very prosperous. Many local factories, such as China Chemical, Family, Yonghe, Meixing, Xianshi, Nanyang, and Hua, have all purchased and used it extensively. Since the price of glycerin from Europe and the United States has increased, and import taxes have been added, if Shanghai did not have domestically produced glycerin, foreign goods would have already risen in price. The factories that need glycerin would inevitably be affected. The close relationship between raw materials and finished products means that our country has traditionally lacked raw materials, leading to high production costs. As a result, our goods often cannot compete with foreign goods in the market. It is not easy for domestically produced glycerin to achieve such success. It is hoped that major industrialists at home and abroad will continue to promote it, so that both parties can benefit.</p>

<p>The Jianghan Customs has sent a letter to the head office to thoroughly investigate the truth of the accident. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Yangtze River steamer, the Jiangtian, which was traveling from Beijing to Wuhan, damaged a lightship set up by the Jianghan Customs upstream. The Customs is now seeking compensation from the company. The company has not received a detailed report and cannot assess the situation. It has ordered the owner of the steamer to promptly report the actual situation. The circumstances are described below:</p>
<h3 id="e194">Cause of the Lightship Collision <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's old Yangtze River steamer has been chartered by the central government. It was recently renovated and sent to the capital for official duties. On the 7th of this month, the steamer sailed upstream to Wuhan. When it reached the Huguang Sand lightship area near Hankou, the Jianghan Customs had set up a lightship there to warn Yangtze River steamers of navigational safety, displaying signs to prevent merchant ships from running aground and causing accidents. As the Jiangtian steamer sailed through the Huguang Sand area, due to the strong winds and turbulent tides, the hull was subjected to wind and wave pressure, causing it to collide with the Customs lightship, damaging its hull.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Customs Demands Compensation <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>After the incident occurred, the Jianghan Customs river patrol investigated and reported the extent of the damage to the Huguang Sand lightship and the circumstances of the Jiangtian steamer's accident to the port authority. They contacted the owner of the Jiangtian steamer to demand compensation for the loss. At the same time, they sent a letter to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, requesting compensation for the loss of the Huguang Sand lightship, and urgently sent workers to carry out major repairs to avoid hindering the navigation of other ships.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Order to the Ship Owner to Report Quickly <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai China Merchants Steam Navigation Company received this letter, along with a report from the owner of the Jiangtian steamer stating that the Jiangtian steamer was subjected to wind and water pressure when passing through Huguang Sand, and collided with the lightship. At that time, it safely passed through. According to the report from the officer on duty, the lightship was not heard to sound an alarm indicating that it had been severely damaged. The company believed that the ship owner's report did not indicate any major damage, which did not match the river patrol's report. Therefore, yesterday, the company issued an order to the Jiangtian ship owner, Qin Lin, to quickly submit a detailed report on the damage to the Huguang Sand lightship and the extent of the damage to the lightship for verification.</p>

<p>The Great Wall Record Company at 152 Henan Road, originally scheduled to release the third phase of new films on August 1st, has learned that the new films have been shipped from Germany and are expected to arrive in Shanghai within a few days. If customs clearance is handled quickly, the release date is expected to be advanced by several days to the 26th of this month. Both sales and operations are working hard. The recording of the third phase of new films has improved compared to the previous ones. The operas recorded are all carefully written masterpieces by famous actors. For example, the ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth sections of Farewell My Concubine, sung by Mei Lanfang and Yang Xiaolou, are clear, structured, and the scene coordination is even. All of these are great works that have opened up a new era in the record industry. Other works, such as Mei Lanfang's Battle of Puguan, Colorful Building Match, Handsome Concubine Xi Ren, Red Thread Stealing Box, Yang Xiaolou's Taking Gao Deng, Battle of Wancheng, Cheng Yanqiu's Wenji Returning to Han, Xun Cisheng's Jade Hall Spring Prostitute's Revenge, Shang Xiaoyun's Rainbow Pass Drunkenness, Meng Xiaodong's Capturing and Releasing the Lodging Shop, Jin Shaoshan's Chain Set, Sitting in the Village Stealing Horses, and other films, are all fine works that have never been recorded in the record industry.</p>

<p>The Paramount Grand Hotel Ballroom at the intersection of Jingan Temple and Yuyuan Road has been temporarily closed for business for many days due to the summer vacation. The internal renovation plan is being actively prepared and is progressing day by day. The first step of the new plan, hiring a priceless song and dance troupe, has been completed. It is said that the entire troupe has more than twenty young dancers. They are graceful and elegant, their dances are like dragons and surprised geese, and their songs are like seagulls and orioles. The beauty of their costumes and the health of their bodies are even more unnecessary. The song and dance programs include "42nd Street", "Tianxiang Dance", "Nian Nujiao", and many others. They are all colorful and the dance is beautiful. According to the person in charge, the national virgins are still virgins on the sea, and they are not comparable to those gathered by first- or second-rate wandering song and dance troupes. They are known for their true talent and skills. Their emphasis is such that one can imagine how the troupe's skills are. The band is currently under negotiation, and good news will be announced soon. The hotel section is still open as usual. In recent days, many ladies who are deceived have come to stay here to escape the summer heat, instead of traveling to Qingdao or Putuo. The equipment and food are all comfortable, and the natural cool breeze is blowing, no less than the seaside flavor, so guests feel at home and it is regarded as a unique place on the sea.</p>

<p>Reading Questions and Answers</p>
<h3 id="e223">Regarding "An Outline of Literature" (Continued) <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>Reply to Zhou Yun Jun</p>
<p>We can divide the questions raised by Mr. Zhou into three parts to answer: First, what should an outline of literature provide to readers? Second, is Pan's "Outline of Literature" good or not? Third, which outline of literature is more readable?</p>
<p>An outline of literature, as the name suggests, is a summarized account of various issues in the field of literature, making it easier for beginners to grasp a simple and clear concept of literature and thus know how to study literature. This is not a compilation, nor does it become a monograph, because a compilation is only putting together the opinions of various schools and individuals, without the need to add one's own opinions. However, writing an outline of literature cannot be done this way. It requires the author to have a fixed literary stance and a systematic theoretical study; otherwise, readers will feel clueless and the content will seem disorganized. For example, when discussing the definition of literature, you can certainly cite various different opinions such as those of Oscar Wilde, Taine, Tolstoy, and Mikhailovsky, but you must not forget the era you are in and your own views. You must have crucial annotations for those different opinions, so that readers can understand which ones are right and which ones are wrong, without feeling confused. Also, an outline cannot emphasize one issue too much or ignore another. It needs to take all aspects into account (of course, your own opinions are still necessary). For example, when discussing the evolution of literature, you should not only talk about Aestheticism or completely dismiss Aestheticism. You must briefly discuss everything from Classicism to Socialist Realism. The content of an outline should not be too empty or too complicated. Rather than being all-encompassing and turning it into a mess, it is better to be simple and able to grasp the core of the theory. An outline of literature is written for beginners in literature or those who do not necessarily specialize in literature but only need to acquire some basic literary knowledge.</p>
<p>From the reader's perspective, one should not have excessive expectations when reading an outline of literature. The main purpose is only to solve some simple questions such as what is literature and the essence of literature. If you think that an outline should be all-encompassing and that you should know everything about literature after reading one, then you are exaggerating yourself. An outline can only give you a correct hint on each issue. What happens after the hint is given is further research, which is not the responsibility of the outline. To criticize whether an outline is good or not, the first thing to consider is whether the book is systematic, whether the theory is correct, and whether it points us in the right direction. As for Mr. Zhou's feeling of emptiness, I am afraid it is because Mr. Zhou is a little too demanding of the outline of literature.</p>

<h3 id="e224">Water Nature <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Gong Han</p>
<p>The weather has been extremely hot for nearly twenty days. Looking at the Shanghai newspapers, almost every day there are records of people drowning while swimming in the river. This is rare in our village.</p>
<p>Our village has a lot of water, and people have a lot of knowledge about water and many can float. If you can't float, you don't go into the water easily. This ability to float is commonly called "knowing water nature."</p>
<p>This "knowing water nature," if explained in more detail using the "comprador" vernacular, is: first, knowing that fire can burn people to death, and water can also drown people, but water looks gentle and seems easy to approach, so it is also easy to be fooled; second, knowing that although water can drown people, it can also float people, so now we try to manipulate it, specifically to use its ability to float people; third, is learning the manipulation method. Once this method is mastered, "knowing water nature" is considered complete.</p>
<p>But people in the city not only cannot float, but also seem to have forgotten that water can drown people. They are not prepared at all, and they don't even measure the depth of the water before jumping in when it gets unbearably hot. If they unfortunately end up in a deep spot, then of course they will die. And I feel that people in the city who are willing to try to help seem to be fewer than in the countryside.</p>
<p>But saving city people is probably more difficult, because not only must the rescuer "know water nature," but the rescued person must also "know water nature" to some extent. He should not use any force, and let the rescuer hold his chin and float him to a shallow place. If he is too impatient and desperately climbs onto the rescuer, then if the rescuer is not skilled, he will have to sink with him.</p>
<p>So I think, if you want to go into the river, it is best to learn a little floating skills beforehand, and you don't have to go to a swimming pool in a park, just go to the riverside, but you must have an expert to guide you. Secondly, if for various reasons you can't learn to float, then use a bamboo pole to probe the depth of the river water first, and just dabble in the shallow water, or the safest thing to do is to scoop up the water and just rinse yourself on the river bank. And the most important thing is to know that water has the nature of drowning people who can't swim, and you must remember it firmly!</p>
<p>Now, advocating the promotion of such common sense may seem crazy, or aimed at "gossip," but the facts prove that this is definitely not the case. Many things cannot be done with our eyes closed, just to please progressive critics.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Summer Travel <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>On a summer morning, people who are tired of living in the city only need to be on the train and see the green rice fields covered in thin mist, the cotton fields with lemon-yellow flowers, and the families with one or two black buffaloes tied in front of their doors to feel refreshed. Moreover, at the final destination, they are greeted by the sea dotted with tea-brown sails and the mixed sea breeze that brushes against their clothes.</p>
<p>Summer is really a season that tempts people to travel!</p>
<p>On the train to Wusong, I couldn't help but sigh to myself. Yūsuke Tsurumi said about summer travel: "The sun throws all the energy it has accumulated for hundreds of days onto the earth. In this bleak war between heaven and earth, mankind will certainly not shrink back in fear. Most people jump out of their own homes that they are tired of and rush into the arms of nature. This is travel." From this point of view, travelers in the hot summer seem close to warriors. In fact, for example, this trip to Wusong, I only feel that it is an outright theft of leisure, and there is no sense of competing with nature. If we really regard hiking under the hot sun as brave, then can we say that those who stay by the machines and boilers all day long are cowards? Mr. Tsurumi's words are correct, but this is only suitable for preaching to the fat people who "sleep well on hot summer days."</p>
<p>Travel is entertainment. Especially in summer, this entertainment should be extended to all people. Although at this moment, it can only be regarded as a dream, it will eventually be realized in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Reading While Sweating <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Zizhan</p>
<p>"Reading books while sweating incessantly, people all wonder what I seek. Do I seek further glory and advancement? I merely pass the long days to dispel my sorrow."</p>
<p>This is one of the poems called "Ningpu Book Affairs" written by Qin Guan of the Northern Song Dynasty, probably when he was demoted and exiled to Hengzhou because of a party scandal. Otherwise, the taste of complaint may not have been so strong. If he was a successful and wealthy man, he could spend his hot days "in pavilions by the water, savoring plums and floating melons." If he was a noble recluse who did not offend others or contend with the world, he could "lie under a north-facing window, with cool breezes blowing from time to time, considering himself a man from the time of Emperor Xi," comfortably escaping these hot May and June days. Helplessly, his fate destined him to fall into the stratum of scholar-officials, but he could not enjoy the blessings that scholar-officials could enjoy, but instead had to bear the burdens that scholar-officials were unwilling to bear. In that scorching summer, the days were too long, so he had to read books while sweating to dispel his worries and boredom!</p>
<p>These past few days, the weather in Shanghai has been particularly hot, and I really can't stand it. Reading books while sweating, why? I can't answer it myself. Remembering Qin Guan's poem, I can't help but feel moved.</p>
<p>Originally, such hot weather is most unsuitable for reading. You can go to the movie theater with air conditioning, or you can talk in a coffee shop with an electric fan, or you can go to the dance hall with summer resort facilities. Of course, ice cream, iced soda, and fruits are indispensable. Otherwise, you would be letting down this modern urban civilization. However, if you are tired of living in such a city, you will also think of the mountains and countryside, especially in this hot summer. Therefore, places such as Lushan, Moganshan, Huangshan, and Jigongshan have become "holy places" for civilized people in the city, high-class Chinese, and foreign gentlemen to escape the summer heat.</p>
<p>As for the vast majority of people who are not fortunate enough to go to such holy places to escape the heat, and cannot live in the city, and cannot enjoy the scientific civilization of summer resorts, they deserve it. If they are lucky enough to be literate, reading books to escape the summer heat is a good way, especially for those who have worries, they can use it to dispel their worries!</p>
<p>Naturally, this time is not the season for reading. Aren't all kinds of schools on summer vacation? However, reading books while sweating is ultimately different from hoeing weeds and planting vegetables. It can be seen that under the same "high sun," some people enjoy blessings because of it, while others see more hardship because of it. Only we bookworms, reading books while sweating, have joy in hardship and hardship in joy. It is still an ideal life of balanced happiness and hardship.</p>
<p>Sweat is not something to be cursed. If a person does not sweat when they should, they are sick, and aspirin, ephedra, and cinnamon twigs become holy medicines. If the sweat pores are blocked, like a blocked nose, breathing is not smooth, which is uncomfortable. If sweat cannot be secreted, like urine cannot be discharged, it is also impossible to survive. A little sweat is not a big sacrifice. Young masters and misses, old masters and ladies, don't be afraid. The average literati cannot carry on their shoulders or lift with their hands, and have very few opportunities for labor, so they don't sacrifice much sweat either. Not to mention sweating and suffering, on such a hot day, you sweat when you read books, and you sweat even when you don't read books. Moreover, "reading books does not forget to save the country, saving the country does not forget to read books," and reading books has "unexpected effects." Sweating your own sweat, reading your own books, and saving your own country, why not do it?</p>
<p>If young masters and misses issue declarations and shout slogans against my theory of reading books while sweating, I will not insist on my original views to achieve thoroughness. I am clear about this kind of worldliness. This confused article is too timid, so I will quote a poem that is said to be from a naughty child who ran away from school as the end of the talk.</p>
<p>"Spring is not a day for reading, hot summer days are good for sleeping. Autumn has mosquitoes and winter has snow, focus on preparing for next year."</p>
<h3 id="e227">Hot in Nanjing (3) <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Shushan</p>
<p>Besides these, there are also the First Park, the Qinhuai River, Mochou Lake, and Xuanwu Lake. Although these places are also haunts for prostitutes and hooligans, there is also a group of young villains who organize a so-called "flower picking group" who often come here to seduce young women, which is annoying to watch.</p>
<p>××</p>
<p>The First Park has many visitors because it is close to the prostitute area on both sides of the Qinhuai River. Moreover, the Xiaoyao You Restaurant inside regularly opens outdoor tea houses, and someone has even set up an outdoor cinema, so its attraction is particularly great. Even those who do not have money to eat tea and watch movies can go inside, sit on benches, or lie on the grass, welcoming the breeze and feeling refreshed, which is much better than staying at home. What's more, many live dramas between men and women will unfold in front of your eyes one scene after another?</p>
<p>××</p>
<p>After the gate was opened, the water in the Qinhuai River no longer smells bad. As long as you have money, you can buy a boat and row in the middle of the river all night long. Although it is strictly forbidden for singing girls to accompany guests on the river, and all prostitutes are banned from singing on boats, if you bring her to the boat and talk to her like a lover, make her laugh, lean on her, tease her, kiss her, hug her... who would dare to interfere? Furthermore, the ban on singing girls serving wine is just a loss for the tavern owners. Guests can still take them to big hotel rooms, or call them to serve tea and ice cream at outdoor tea houses, or go to golf courses, or take a car for a ride, it's just a change of style. As for the Qinhuai Little Park, it is only because it is the pier for flower boats to come and go, and half of it is occupied by outdoor tea houses, and it is also a place where lower-class prostitutes linger, so it is no longer a place to linger.</p>
<p>××</p>
<p>Xuanwu Lake, although it is also outside the city, is relatively convenient because the city government is very focused on developing the Five Continents Park in the heart of the lake, and a asphalt road has been built directly to it. However, the lotus flowers there have not recovered their former appearance since they were flooded by the great flood of the previous year; moreover, the lake water has gradually dried up, so yachts are inconvenient to travel, and Xuanwumen still has to be locked at midnight, so the time is limited; therefore, the excitement is only in the afternoon until dusk, after which it gradually cools down and cannot reach the Qinhuai River.</p>
<p>××</p>
<p>Mochou Lake is outside Xiaoximen, and its proximity to the city is about the same as Yuhuatai outside Zhonghuamen, but the transportation is not as good as there. In such places, strange things often happen because they are desolate. For example, a young woman under Yuhuatai, who was sleeping outdoors, was raped, which is just one of the representatives because it was reported in the newspaper. Speaking of the strange stories by Mochou Lake, first, a university student and a female staff member became lovers because of swimming on Jiulong Bridge. The other day, they went there to cool off at night, and finally engaged in wild fornication under the trees. It happened to be seen by the hooligan Wang Xiaoliuzi, who then invited many accomplices to promote the rape and forced the two of them into a small inn to negotiate, and finally they were extorted a sum of money before the matter was over. For example, a pair of twin sisters of a nearby merchant went to cool off together the day before yesterday evening. The hooligans dared to hire a carriage to wait for them on their way home, and robbed their sister and drove her to Binjiang Township, intending to rape her and force her to be his wife, but fortunately they were caught at the time. Such things are often heard, and all of them can be said to be the sins caused by the hot weather.</p>
<p>××</p>
<p>In addition, there are also some open-air gardens or rooftop gardens, which are also places for eating tea and cooling off. The first is the open-air garden expanded by the Dashijie in the city, which is built around the water inside Sixiang Bridge, and it is also cool. There are Peking opera, movies, golf courses, several yachts, and tea seats everywhere. If you want to eat Western food, Shanghai Coffee Shop will take care of it. If you want to eat Chinese food, Chuan Guan Queen Hotel will take care of it. In short, this is a gold-selling cave, and you don't want to ask about it if you have no money. Also, if you don't bring a modern girl with you, or you go there to chase women, then it's not very interesting. Secondly, the rooftop garden of Anle Hotel, the Jiangsu Garden upstairs in Nanjing Grand Theater, and the Central Garden in Xinjiekou are all places for idle class young masters and ladies to cool off, and have nothing to do with the poor.</p>

<p>Arriving Again in Chicago</p>
<p>On the map, the United States is a country about the same size as China. In fact, the prosperity of the United States is mostly concentrated on a straight line from New York to Chicago. Within these hundreds of miles, there are many large cities, large mines, and large factories that form the lifeline of American industry. Airplanes fly back and forth in the sky all day long, and telephones and telegrams are busy. Dozens of railways, like a bundle of large iron cables, tightly connect this large industrial area. In this transportation network, everything is fast, busy, passionate, and noisy.</p>
<p>After a night's ride in a large car, I, who was used to being mixed in with busyness and speed, actually felt quite tired. Especially when the car passed through the towering mountains and headed towards the coal-blackened city of Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh).</p>
<p>Pittsburgh—the hometown of countless great industrialists and great capitalists in the United States, is, in my opinion, the ugliest and dirtiest city in the world. Gray houses are built upside down on mountains with no green grass. The streets are so narrow, and the pedestrians on the road, regardless of gender, all have a cannibalistic look. Large red advertisements are painted on the walls and windows, like fresh blood left on the mouth of a poisonous snake.</p>
<p>In the mountains, thousands of chimneys spew out smoky coal smoke. In that hellish factory, how many Americans are selling their sweat and blood? Sweat and blood have formed the tens of millions of fortunes of steel tycoons and lead tycoons. Pittsburgh's steel and lead built New York's Wall Street, and above New York's Wall Street floats a so-called Washington government. Old Mellon, who served as the Minister of Finance for three dynasties, is the proud son of Pittsburgh. Carnegie, who once manipulated the fate of industries on both continents of Europe and America, came from Pittsburgh's steel shop as an apprentice. After Carnegie's steel company was sold to the bank tycoon Morgan, that tyrant of New York banking used his United States Steel Corporation to manipulate the fate of American and even world industries.</p>
<p>It was not easy to leave Pittsburgh's coal smoke. The car sped westward at a speed of five miles per hour. Large cities are strung together like beads to form this wonderful chain of capitalist countries. On this side is the automobile city cast by the money of Henry Ford; on the other side is the city of Akron, the center of the rubber industry. Cities like Clair and Layton gather tens of millions of workers, who are creating either a good or a bad future for the United States. New industrial cities have stretched out like mushrooms in the past fifty years. Among these many star-like cities, Chicago's position seems to be the bright moon that leads the group.</p>

<p>Key Points for Improvement in Various Schools (4)</p>
<h3 id="e231">Tianjin Beiyang Institute of Technology <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>The college strictly enforces the full-time system for faculty and staff. The main faculty members are rich in teaching experience, and they are able to work hard in research while teaching many courses. Various examinations are also conducted seriously, which is a special advantage of the college. However, the following points still need to be improved in order to be practical and develop specialties.</p>
<p>(1) The equipment for the civil engineering and mechanical engineering departments and the basic physical experiment equipment for each department are not sufficient for application. Books and magazines are also lacking. Funds should be saved to add them year by year.</p>
<p>(2) The Department of Electrical Engineering and the Department of Architectural Engineering were approved to be added before. Now, it is found that most of the equipment for the Department of Electrical Engineering has not been purchased, and the Department of Architectural Engineering has no preparations. It is appropriate to postpone the opening of the Architectural Engineering Department. The Department of Electrical Engineering currently has only one grade and is taught in the same class as the Department of Mechanical Engineering. The original students can be merged into the Department of Mechanical Engineering. The college should carefully consider and submit it for approval. The Department of Chemical Engineering should be postponed. The Department of Aircraft Engineering should properly formulate establishment methods when equipment costs are secured and submit them to the Ministry for approval. Before the equipment funds are secured, courses and lectures such as aeronautics can be set up in the existing departments.</p>
<p>(3) The book lending system and student travel and visit fees should be gradually cancelled to transfer these funds to expand equipment. How to handle it can be submitted by the college for detailed opinions and properly formulated remedial measures for review and handling. It is also found that the books left by the former Department of Law of the college have many important works on law. It is a pity that they are not used. They can be handed over to the School of Law of National Peking University for safekeeping and utilization. You should consult with the university for handling.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Tianjin Private Institute of Industry and Commerce <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>The school's foundation and equipment are still based, and efforts should be made to improve other aspects. The key points that should be improved are presented below.</p>
<p>(1) The two colleges of industry and commerce of the college should be changed to science and engineering, business departments, mechanical and general business departments should be temporarily postponed.</p>
<p>(2) Curriculum standards and descriptions should be drafted as soon as possible and submitted to the Ministry for review and approval. Add two subjects of Party theory and Chinese and improve the content of teaching materials and focus on the study of practical problems in the country.</p>
<p>(3) Various material testing equipment and professional magazines should be purchased, and business practice equipment should also be added.</p>
<p>(4) The faculty and staff should be rehired and more people with teaching and school running experience should be hired. It should also be based on the principle of full-time.</p>
<p>(5) The school's academic atmosphere is very quiet, and teaching methods should be improved and the spirit of students' automatic research should be cultivated.</p>
<p>(6) The school's "Bachelor's Diploma" and "Class B Diploma" do not conform to the Ministry's regulations and should be cancelled. Other rules and regulations and organizational structures should be revised separately in accordance with current education laws and regulations and sent to the Ministry for review.</p>
<h3 id="e233">Hebei Women's Normal College <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>The administrative departments of the college can proceed in an orderly manner, the staff are dedicated to service, the students are diligent and simple, and the discipline is good. However, the following shortcomings still need to be strictly improved.</p>
<p>(1) The college has too many departments. It is difficult to achieve effective results by running with existing funds and teachers. It should be reduced appropriately to enrich it.</p>
<p>1. The two departments of English Education will stop enrollment from the summer vacation of this year and end year by year. However, teaching positions should still be established and taught seriously for English education subjects.</p>
<p>2. The three departments of Home Economics, Physical Education, and Music and Art should be changed to three specialized courses of Home Economics, Physical Education, and Art.</p>
<p>3. The number of students enrolled in the two departments of Chinese and History and Geography and the above three specialized courses should not exceed 80 each year. In the first year, attention must be paid to the training of basic subjects.</p>
<p>(2) The college's teachers' qualifications and experience are mostly unqualified. Full-time teachers are few in number and still hold positions outside the college. Among them, 12 people come from Peiping to teach in the college, which is inappropriate. Next semester, the number of part-time teachers must be reduced, qualified and competent full-time teachers must be rehired, and salaries must be increased.</p>
<p>(3) The college's past enrollment was not strict, and the students' level was mostly low. In the future, enrollment examinations should be conducted strictly, and students in the college should be trained seriously.</p>
<h3 id="e234">Hebei Provincial Institute of Technology <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>The school's strength can focus on equipment and construction matters, save expansion, and increase year by year. The faculty and staff are more full-time and brave to take responsibility. In terms of curriculum, they can also focus on practical problems and practical work, and students are diligent and hardworking, which can create a good academic style. These achievements are commendable. However, important books and professional engineering magazines should be arranged for special funds and purchased by all means. The experimental equipment should be supplemented according to the original plan. The curriculum allocation should be improved according to the opinions stated in the original report. The class hours of full-time professors should be reduced to allow them to devote their spare time to guidance and research. Seek improvement and use expectations.</p>
<h3 id="e235">Hebei Provincial College of Law and Commerce <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>The college's management is deemed significantly inadequate, and it should immediately cease enrolling new students and transfer students for the next academic year. Meanwhile, the college should make a sincere effort to reorganize itself to observe its future effects. The following are the key points to be noted:</p>
<p>(1) The college's allocation of funds, with equipment expenses being less than 6%, is considered too low. Most of the reference books are outdated. Complete sets of magazines suitable for research are rarely seen, and practical equipment has not been set up. Equipment expenses should be increased next academic year to add books, magazines, and various practical equipment.</p>
<p>(2) Many teachers at the college also hold positions elsewhere. The hours of leave and absence are numerous, leading students to follow suit, regarding truancy as a common occurrence. In the next academic year, it is essential to hire at least two-thirds of the faculty as full-time teachers and restrict leave and absences to avoid affecting students' studies.</p>
<p>(3) The college's past enrollment practices lacked rigor, and students in school frequently skipped classes at will. The library was not utilized, and disciplinary management was inadequate, leading to students' low academic levels and the decline of academic atmosphere. Hereafter, truancy should be strictly prohibited, and serious training should be implemented to eliminate long-standing malpractices.</p>

<p>The college is still capable of striving for revitalization, with all measures proceeding in an orderly manner. The allocation of funds is considered appropriate, and faculty and staff are committed to full-time positions. Professors and students have close contact day and night, which greatly facilitates research leadership. The school discipline is also commendable and worthy of praise. However, the affiliated hospital is too small in scale, and the equipment in the otolaryngology, physiotherapy, and surgery departments is inadequate. The number of beds is insufficient for practical training, and there is a lack of Western books. All efforts should be made to expand these areas. The number of staff members is more than double the number of teachers and should be reduced appropriately. The college should also enrich its faculty in specialized subjects. Student leave and absences must be restricted to emphasize academics. Regarding financial difficulties, if provincial funds cannot be allocated, the college may, on its own, request subsidies from the Geng款 (Boxer Indemnity) fund authorities according to procedures.</p>
<h3 id="e237">Baoding Hebei Provincial Agricultural College <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>The college's allocation of funds is focused on equipment, and the curriculum emphasizes practical training. Faculty and staff are committed to full-time positions and devoted to teaching and research. Students are diligent, simple, and disciplined. Disciplinary training and assessment are rigorous, and all these achievements are commendable. However, some courses at the college have more than 40 hours per week, which should be reduced in quantity and enriched in content. Basic knowledge of mechanics, heat, light, and electricity in general physics is extremely necessary for agricultural students and should be added accordingly to facilitate their studies. Special attention should be paid to the improvement and development of local major products to facilitate practical application.</p>
<h3 id="e238">Jinan National Shandong University <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>The university's recent facilities have been improving in an orderly manner, which is highly commendable. The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences focuses on science while using the Chinese and foreign literature departments to assist the entire school in the basic training of Chinese and foreign languages. This is a new creation, and its intention is good. Focusing on the analysis of Chinese medicinal materials in chemistry and the research of coastal organisms in biology is very appropriate.</p>
<p>However, specialized journals in the library are insufficient for research reference. The surveying instruments in the Civil Engineering Department of the College of Engineering and the experimental equipment in the Civil Engineering Machinery Department are lacking and should be supplemented. Professors should also be added. The curriculum arrangement should be revised based on the opinions presented in the report. Administrative organization and fund allocation should be economical and reasonable. Work efficiency should be improved, and all plans should be adapted to regional needs. If the College of Agriculture is difficult to establish due to funding constraints, the existing school buildings, grounds, and equipment of the original agricultural experiment station may be temporarily transferred to the Shandong Provincial Department of Education for the purpose of establishing an agricultural vocational school, while also taking local needs into consideration. This should be discussed and handled with the Department of Education. League of Nations Committee on Intellectual Cooperation.</p>

<p>Mr. Morrish suggested the establishment of a job placement office for Chinese intellectuals. Wang Shijie has broad and far-reaching ideas on the work of cultural cooperation. (Geneva Reuters, 18th) The League of Nations Committee on Intellectual Cooperation (the Third International Education Conference mentioned by Havas yesterday) today considered the report of French educator Mr. Morrish on his mission to China. The report stated that Chinese Minister of Education Wang Shijie has broad and far-reaching ideas on the work of cultural cooperation. The report also cited the number of adult students since 1928 to prove the large increase in adult students and stated that regarding higher education, the spirit of research and exploration should be developed. The report also mentioned the importance of developing technical education based on the needs of the new China and advocated the implementation of small indigenous or modern industries so that farmers can increase their income. The report finally advocated broadcasting lectures throughout the country and stated that a system of inspecting various schools, especially primary and secondary schools, should be developed.</p>
<p>Explanation from the Ministry of Education</p>
<h3 id="e240">Qualification Criteria for Primary School Teachers <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, based on a report from the Hunan Provincial Department of Education regarding doubts about the qualification of primary school teachers submitted by the Hengyang Education Bureau, requested instructions. The Ministry of Education instructed the department that, according to the Provisional Regulations for Rural Normal Schools revised in the province in the 20th year of the Republic [1931], the duration of study for rural normal schools that enroll junior high school graduates is two years, for primary school teachers who have the equivalent of junior high school education and have been engaged in education for more than one year, the duration of study is three years, and for those who enroll senior primary school graduates, the duration of study is four years. Graduates of rural normal schools in the province who meet the qualifications of the first item of the above regulations should be equivalent to graduates of the old-system normal schools. Those who meet the qualifications of the second item should be equivalent to graduates of the senior high school normal department. Those who meet the qualifications of the third item should be equivalent to graduates of simple rural normal schools. According to the report, before the promulgation of the Provisional Regulations for Rural Normal Schools, the duration of study at various rural normal schools was relatively shorter than the above regulations. The department did not state the admission qualifications of the graduates of various rural normal schools, and the ministry could not verify their qualifications. For the sake of appointment, the department should handle the admission qualifications and duration of study of graduates of various rural normal schools separately according to the provisions of Articles 78 and 79 of the primary school regulations.</p>

<p>(Anhui News) There is a private Lizhe Junior High School in Fuyang, northern Anhui, which has been operating for many years and has been registered. Recently, the Anhui Provincial Department of Education, based on a report from the supervisor, found that the school was poorly managed and has ordered the school to suspend operations and reported it to the ministry for record.</p>
<h3 id="e243">Zhejiang Fisheries School Retains Principal <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>Jin Zhao, the principal of Zhejiang Provincial Senior Vocational Fisheries School, had previously submitted his resignation to the Construction Department due to his desire to study in Europe. His resignation was approved, and the department appointed Wu Zhongyuan as acting principal. This has been reported in various newspapers. It is now learned that the student union of the school, believing that Principal Jin is knowledgeable and has effective training methods, convened an emergency meeting and sent representatives to the Construction Department to request the revocation of the order. They also sent a letter to Principal Jin asking him to dismiss the idea of resigning and a letter to Acting Principal Wu refusing to come to the school. The letter to the Construction Department reads in part: "It has been three years since our school's Principal Jin was appointed, and he has devoted himself to training students and improving school affairs. He sees the school as more important than his family and loves the students more than his children. He is constantly working and tireless. From the beginning of his tenure, he has raised the level of students, changing the requirement from five years of study after graduating from senior primary school to three years of study after graduating from junior high school. He also added an aquaculture department to complete our country's entire fisheries education system. At the same time, he made every effort to recruit well-known domestic scholars to serve as teachers. Suddenly, the number of students increased sharply, and school affairs improved day by day. Principal Jin also believes that our school is a vocational school that emphasizes both knowledge and skills, so he obtained permission from your department to purchase chemical drugs, instruments, and specimens to enhance the effectiveness of teaching and arouse students' interest. At the same time, the aquaculture department is newly established and lacks practical training facilities. Due to limited funding, he first built two experimental ponds. As for future plans, the opening of freshwater and saltwater aquaculture farms and the lending of funds to graduates of our school to study in Japan have been approved by your department and are waiting to be implemented step by step. The students are celebrating the unlimited development of our alma mater in the future. We are surprised that Principal Jin suddenly had the intention to resign before these plans were realized and that your department approved his resignation and appointed Wu Zhongyuan as acting principal. According to the Southeast Daily, there are questions about Wu's qualifications as acting principal, as he studied at the Tokyo Fisheries Training Institute in Japan. Wu has served as a teacher at the Jimei, Wusong, and Tianjin Fisheries Schools, but his time there was mostly no more than half a year. He was dismissed from these schools because he was dissatisfied with his colleagues and classmates. It is conceivable whether his past achievements in fisheries education can be admired by the students. For the sake of our own studies, the development of our school, and the future of the fisheries industry in Zhejiang, we have to send representatives to petition you. We hope that you, sir, care about the students and have a benevolent heart, and that you have a grand plan to improve fisheries. Please allow us to withdraw your order so as to develop and benefit fisheries. This would be a great kindness." Middle School Science Teachers of this city</p>

<p>The Education Bureau has strictly ordered all schools to send staff to attend lectures and classes on schedule. The summer training class for science teachers in secondary schools in this city has been accepting registrations since the 9th of this month, but in consideration of the fact that many secondary school teachers have returned to their hometowns during the summer vacation and have not been able to come to Shanghai to register in time, the Municipal Education Bureau has specially extended the registration period by one week until 4:00 p.m. on the 21st of this month and has strictly ordered all schools to comply with the regulations and send staff to register for lectures. The details have been published in this newspaper. The latest details of the class are as follows:</p>

<p>Requests for Exemption Not Approved It is true that many schools have complied with the order to send staff to register for lectures, but many have also submitted requests to the Education Bureau for exemption, such as Kaiming Middle School, Yunchong Girls' Middle School, Chizhi Affiliated Middle School, Huahua, Jianguo, Qiaoguang, etc. Some middle schools have requested exemption from registration because their teachers graduated from domestic public and private universities and are employed as science teachers, or because they are unable to participate in the training class due to other matters. It is heard that none of these requests have been approved, and they are still ordered to enroll by the deadline. Measures for Violating the Order The purpose of holding this summer training class in this city is to implement the order of the Ministry of Education to improve science teaching in various schools and raise the academic level of students. However, it is found that dozens of schools, such as Private Zhongxi Girls' Middle School, Minli Middle School, Minsheng Junior High School, Qingxin Co-educational Middle School, Qingnian Middle School, Fudan Affiliated Middle School, and McLaren Middle School, have not yet complied with the order as the registration deadline approaches.

In addition to the fact that these teachers will not be allowed to be hired in the next semester, there will be no loans.</p>
<p>Classes Start on Schedule It is also reported that the opening ceremony for the class was originally scheduled for July 15th, and classes were scheduled to begin on the 16th.

It is now heard that the opening ceremony for the class will be held at Jiaotong University at 9:00 a.m. on the 22nd, and classes will begin on the 23rd. Students attending lectures are also allowed to reside there starting on the 21st.</p>

<p>The Municipal Education Bureau yesterday ordered all municipal schools to be informed. The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau yesterday issued an order to all municipal schools stating that, according to the Municipal Government Order No. 10138, "Regarding the revenue, expenditure, deposit, and transfer of all funds of municipal schools, the Municipal Government has previously established unified revenue and expenditure measures, which should be managed uniformly by the Municipal Bank and ordered to be followed. It is now found that some schools in the urban area still deposit educational funds, educational funds, etc. in other banks, and have failed to comply with the order, which greatly hinders the unified revenue and expenditure in the future. We hereby request that you submit this to the mayor and order the Education Bureau to order all schools to comply with the previous order in the future regarding the revenue and expenditure of school funds, school building funds, and all educational funds, and to have them managed uniformly by this bank in order to comply with the law," etc. According to this, all funds received by various agencies, regardless of the item, should be submitted to the Municipal Bank and deposited into the Municipal Treasury account. This has been clearly stipulated in the unified revenue and expenditure measures and has been ordered to be followed. However, it is now the case that some schools in the urban area still deposit educational funds, educational funds, etc. in other banks, which is a violation of the law. The bureau has the responsibility to supervise and should immediately order the schools in the urban area to comply with the regulations on unified measures in the future regarding all educational funds, to send them to the Municipal Bank for handling at any time, and to pay attention to investigation. If the above-mentioned malpractices are found, they should be ordered to be changed and should not be neglected. In addition to ordering the office to reply, the bureau should follow and report this order. According to this, all schools should comply with the unified revenue and expenditure measures established by the Municipal Government regarding the receipt and payment of funds in the future and submit them to the Shanghai Municipal Bank for handling. They should also submit them to the bureau on a regular basis for forwarding, as before, and should not violate this order.</p>

The original text is as follows: "We have previously approved the official letter from the Public Works Bureau of the First Special District that the private Fudan Experimental Middle School and other schools have failed to meet the conditions and have temporarily suspended the payment of subsidies for 1934. This has been notified to the schools concerned. However, the original translation 'Fudan Experimental Middle School should move out of the concession before the end of July' should be changed to 'Fudan Experimental Middle School may move out of the concession before the end of July'."</p>

<p>Chapter 4: The Right-Handed Forehand Stroke</p>
<h3 id="e266">Analysis of the most important stroke in tennis and explanation of the differences between various hitting methods <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>When returning the opponent's ball, Ground-Strokes, or hitting the ball after it bounces, should account for 80% of the time. Volleys, hitting the ball before it bounces, are rare. There are two types of strokes for handling ground balls: first, the forehand stroke, which is when the ball bounces to the player's right when facing the net (specifically for right-handed players; it's the opposite for left-handed players); second, the backhand stroke, which is when the ball bounces to the player's left when facing the net.</p>
<p>The forehand ground stroke is used very frequently, so it is a fundamental technique. Usually, experienced players will use this method to return the ball whenever possible, and they all consider it the easiest and most natural method.</p>
<p>When hitting a forehand, the player's right shoulder is behind the incoming ball, so the right hand has great striking power when it sweeps forward. However, when hitting a backhand, the player's right shoulder must be slightly in front of the incoming ball. At this time, the hitting action is inevitably restricted by the elbow, making it less natural than the forehand. Some players specialize in the backhand, achieving the same effect as the forehand. Even fewer players have perfected the backhand, and they sometimes enjoy using that side to hit the ball.</p>
<p>When hitting a forehand, it is very natural to twist the wrist forward. Conversely, when hitting a backhand, the wrist must be twisted backward, bending the knuckles forward. If the angle between the racket and the incoming ball is not accurate, the wrist will have difficulty being locked. Therefore, wrist movement is much freer in the forehand than in the backhand. Some players don't even twist their wrists when hitting a backhand; they simply handle it stiffly.</p>
<p>When moving forward to meet the incoming ball, the player must choose the direction of their stroke. After deciding on the direction, quickly move the feet according to the forehand or backhand stance, stepping on the left or right side of the ball. As for how to choose the direction of the stroke, it depends entirely on the player's position on the court and the opponent's position. If the incoming ball lands near the center of the court, it is very easy to decide the direction of the stroke, and in this situation, the forehand is used nine times out of ten. If the incoming ball is far from the body, it is impossible for the player to choose the direction of the stroke, so they have to assess the situation and deal with the crisis accordingly.</p>

<h3 id="e267">Gold Standard Decline Has Stabilized <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>Those Taking Advantage of Low Prices to Cover Are Numerous</p>
<p>=Silver Prices Rise, Shanghai Market Weak, Central Bank's Cash Collection Enables Rise=</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market's sentiment was still weak, but because the foreign exchange market was tight, arbitrage activity continued. As the Central Bank collected cash, the market was able to rebound. In the morning, overseas silver markets in both the UK and the US rose consistently. The Five Metals Exchange saw forward silver prices increase by five hao to two li. Foreign exchange rates contracted, London spot gold rose one penny, US cotton rose seven pounds, and US wheat was at 1375. Stocks rose slightly, and as market sentiment tended to weaken, the market declined. Preliminary trading opened at 81 yuan. However, the increase in forward silver prices was minimal, and transactions were even scarcer. Those taking advantage of low prices to cover were numerous, and the market situation was stable. After the opening, banks showed a strong appetite to buy, keeping the market stable, but the overall sentiment remained downward, with prices more likely to fall than rise. The situation was generally stagnant. When the HSBC exchange rate remained unchanged, the domestic market was tight, and buyers were still active, which helped maintain the overall market. The Central Bank continued to inject spot goods, improving market sentiment. In addition, the banking and foreign exchange markets tightened, prompting more buyers in the market, gradually pushing prices up. The market situation was quite stable. News of the night market silver price in Seattle suddenly moved, rising to 125.25.375, with considerable activity hovering around four yuan. Moreover, the US dollar weakened again, leading major players to eagerly buy. Small-scale short sellers also covered their positions, and gold prices continued to rise. Although many took advantage of the high prices to sell in the morning, the major players also maintained their positions strongly, and the trend stabilized. In the afternoon, the Seattle night market silver price reported a decline of 125, but remained unchanged. The Bombay telegraph also remained unchanged. Gold prices in Shanghai were stable. Banks preferred to buy forward contracts over spot goods. Major players took advantage of the high prices to sell some of their holdings, leading to a slight decline. Banks continued to buy forward US dollars, and after the low, prices remained stable. The second telegraph from Bombay reported an increase of 3.2 annas. At this time, the situation was volatile, but sentiment was still calm. The market closed stably. The day's market situation was mediocre, and with ample supplies, even weak sentiment was unlikely to cause a major decline. The price of pure gold was estimated at 995 yuan, and the deferred spread rose to 5.5 yuan. A summary of the day's market situation follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 982 yuan, a decrease of 8 jiao compared to the previous close. Goods opened at 1.9 yuan. Foreign exchange rates opened with the near-term selling price for British pounds at 1 shilling and 4 pence 1875, and US dollars at 34.0625 yuan. Zhengjin, Mitsui, and Huabi were buying US dollars for October at 375. Yuanchun, Yongfeng, Dadecheng, Zhaofengchang, and Hengxingyuan advanced to 3 yuan. Fuxingyong and Huixiang sold, dropping to 1.8 yuan. Yuanmaoyong and Hongxing continued to buy non-stop. Mitsui bought US dollars for November at 4375 and for October at 375. Yuanchun and Shunli also took positions, rising to 3.5 yuan. Sentiment remained weak, and Fuxingyong, Yifengheng, Dadecheng, and others sold goods, dropping again to 1.8 yuan. It was learned that the HSBC exchange rate remained flat for both the UK and US currencies. Yifengyong, Yuanmaoyong, Qianchangxiang, and Hengyu took advantage of the low prices to continue buying, rising to around 3 yuan. Shengda, Yifengheng, and Yuqingyong sold. Huabi offered US dollars for September at 25, but prices continued to fall. After that, the Central Bank continued to inject spot goods, and sentiment improved. Banks had a healthy appetite to buy. Yuanfengyong, Yuanchangyong, Runchangyu, Zhaofengchang, Yuanshengyong, Yuanchun, Hengyu, Dadecheng, Fuyu, Futaiheng, and others all took positions, rising to 3.3 yuan. Yuqingyong and Shunmao still supplied goods, retreating to 2.7 yuan. Banks repeatedly bought, tightening the domestic market. Huabi and McAlister bought US dollars for October at 3125 and 375 respectively, pushing prices higher. Futaiheng, Hengyu, Zhaofengchang, Qingfayong, and others were enthusiastic to buy. Mitsui and Huabi bought US dollars for October at 3125, rising to 4.8 yuan. Yifengyong, Fuyu, and Shunli took advantage of the high prices to sell, dropping to 4 yuan. Hongli and Hengyu supported the market with enthusiastic buying. Hengyu and Yifengyong continued to buy, rising to 4.4 yuan. The noon close was 984.3 yuan, and goods were priced at 4.2 yuan.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the Seattle night market silver price reported a decline of 125 and then remained unchanged. Bombay was also flat. The opening was 984.6 yuan, and the situation stabilized. Yuanxiang and Fuxingyong took positions, rising to 4.9 yuan. Some US dollars were at 3125, and banks wanted them all. Hongxing and Yifengheng sold, retreating to 4.4 yuan. McAlister bought US dollars for October at 3125, and Fuxingyong bought again, rising to 4.9 yuan. The Dalian gang supplied goods, causing prices to fall. Subsequently, Hengxingyuan and Qianchangxiang worked hard to supply goods, retreating to 4 yuan. Citibank offered US dollars for September at 1875, and Yifengyong sold aggressively, falling to 3.7 yuan. Afterward, the market stabilized, and banks continued to buy forward contracts. However, because Bombay had risen by 3 annas, Yongfeng and Qingfayong still supplied goods, and prices hovered around 4 yuan. Later, Dadecheng, Xianghe, Yuqingyong, and the Dalian gang all took positions, gradually rising to 4.5 yuan. The closing was 984.4 yuan, and goods were priced at 4.3 yuan. After the market closed, Hengyu and Yuanmaoyong, and Wuntai supplied goods, retreating to within 4 yuan. The highest price of the day was 984.9 yuan, and the lowest price was 981.8 yuan, a fluctuation of 3.1 yuan. As a result, the closing was 1.6 yuan higher than the previous close.</p>
<p>The settlement price, based on the HSBC exchange rate for US dollars, remained unchanged at 33.625 yuan, resulting in a gold standard price of 1029 yuan. According to the closing price, this was approximately 44 yuan, slightly more than 1 yuan less than the previous close. The August registration price was 988 yuan, and the September price was 984 yuan. Morning replenishment was at 988 yuan, and afternoon replenishment was at the same price. The price of pure gold was estimated at 995 yuan. Trading in the market was mediocre. The Tianjin gang still supplied goods, which were bought by Yifengheng for approximately 6,000 taels, to be delivered starting August 1, with an additional 16 yuan. This was not a futures contract, but approximately 15 yuan, as it avoided over 10 days of interest. The Central Bank continued to inject 490 spot bars, priced at 982 yuan. In the market, Futaiheng traded futures on behalf of Fuchang. The swaps reportedly increased because spot goods had not yet arrived. Fuyu and Hengyu lent Dingtian a total of more than 100 bars at 5 yuan, but many wanted to swap at this price. Therefore, Shenkang lent Yifeng 35 bars at 5.2 yuan. Later, Daxingyong lent Dadecheng 105 bars at 5.2 yuan, and Hengyu lent Yuanting 49 bars at 5.5 yuan. Runchangyu lent Dadecheng 70 bars, retreating to 5.4 yuan. The trend seemed good, so those holding spot goods were reluctant to easily swap them. There were 17,087 July bars remaining, with a total of 8 long positions and 30 short positions.</p>
<p>The supply and demand for transactions in the market were relatively balanced. In summary, Shunli, Yifengheng, Yuqingyong, Yongde, Hengtai, Shunmao, Dadecheng, Ruikang, Shenkang, Huiyuan, Xianghe, Dachangxiang, Dingtai, Shengda, and others were in the offer side. Zhaofengchang, Hengyu, Futaiheng, Hongkangyong, Zhengchang, Tianfeng, Yongfeng, Daxingyong, Hongxing, Yuanchun, Yuanchangyong, Yuanshengyong, Hongli, and others were on the buying side.

The Guangdong gang, Shengda, sold approximately 100 bars. Hengxing was silent. The number of September contracts was 34,615, with a total of 41 long positions and 60 short positions. The total number of transactions for the day was 28,189 in the morning and 7,637 in the afternoon.</p>

Foreign exchange markets opened in the morning with the near-term selling price for British pounds at 1 shilling and 4 pence 2, and US dollars at 34.125 yuan, a contraction of 125 for both British and US currencies compared to the previous close. However, after the opening, prices immediately tightened, and banks bought, tightening the process. After that, apart from doing near-term US dollar hedging, the HSBC exchange rate was announced, and British and US currencies remained unchanged. Banks continued to buy forward US dollars for settlement. Although Chinese merchants supplied, the situation gradually tightened. News of the night market silver price remaining unchanged and rising from 125 to 375 had little impact, as banks were settling accounts, which strongly tightened the foreign exchange market. In the afternoon, the night market silver price contracted by 125 and remained unchanged. Bombay was also flat. Banks bought far and sold near, and the process was mediocre. Later, Bombay rose by 3 annas, but this also had no impact. The closing near-term selling price was 1 shilling and 4 pence 1875 for British pounds, and 34 yuan for US dollars. British and US exchange rates remained unchanged compared to the previous close. Chinese merchants settled approximately 4-5 million US dollars. A summary of the day's transactions follows:</p>

<p>For years, our country has suffered from internal unrest and external aggression, leading to the decline of all industries and the bankruptcy of rural areas. Finance, as the lifeline of all industries, has been affected and feels lifeless. If we do not explore new paths and plan for a way out, our country's finance will inevitably face a catastrophic situation. In recent years, the financial market has only continued to deteriorate. Yesterday, the Shanghai silver interest rate opened at 5% in the morning and afternoon, and the clearing had no additional funds, remaining flat throughout the day. For clearing ticket transactions, there were over 3.6 million in the morning and over 100,000 in the afternoon. Transactions at the small general meeting totaled over 300,000. Over 900,000 in foreign pawn transactions were redeemed, and over 1.1 million were newly pawned. Bank clearing was also extremely quiet. Foreign banks cleared over 1.9 million in checks and bills, over 4.0 million in various goods, foreign exchange pledges, and miscellaneous items, over 500,000 in telegraphic transfers, and 400,000 in warehouse withdrawals. Chinese banks cleared over 2.8 million in checks and bills, over 4.1 million in various goods, foreign exchange pledges, and miscellaneous items, over 700,000 each in telegraphic transfers and customs duties, and 200,000 in warehouse deposits. Japanese banks cleared over 1.6 million in checks and bills, and over 2.5 million in various goods, foreign exchange pledges, and miscellaneous items, with warehouse deposits and withdrawals balanced. Silver houses cleared over 35 million in foreign public bills, over 4.2 million in foreign clearing funds, over 300,000 in various remittances, 900,000 in banknote redemptions, 1.2 million in banknote issuances, 100,000 in inbound remittances, and 300,000 in outbound remittances.</p>
<p>Also, the total number of exchanges at the Shanghai Clearing House on the 19th was 6,717,411.92 yuan, including 3,392,743.13 yuan in silver dollars and 3,324,668.79 yuan in silver dollar drafts.</p>

<p>Yesterday's small silver market saw Jiangjiao open at 836 yuan in the morning, a yuan better than the previous day. By the afternoon, it had fallen back to 835 yuan, resulting in no change from the previous day. There were 3,000 jiao in transactions in the morning and 1,000 jiao in the afternoon. Guangdong small silver was priced at 727.5 yuan in the morning and opened at 727.8 yuan in the afternoon, slightly better than the previous day by 5 jiao. There were 65,000 jiao in transactions in the morning and 35,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins shortened by another 2,000, with 328,000 pieces being exchanged for 7,500 yuan in silver, totaling 24,600 pieces.</p>
<p>Securities</p>
<h3 id="e271">Government Bonds on an Uncertain Path <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>Bulls and Bears Have No Set Opinion, Market Prices Fluctuate</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Huashang Securities Exchange saw inconsistent market prices, fluctuating up and down. This was entirely driven by the supply and demand of securities. Number 4 bonds required only 20 rolls and 20 customs duties, and the appetite for them was still strong. For the rest, such as Number 16 and Number 20 bonds, there were also more buyers than sellers. On the selling side, there were mostly scattered transactions. Therefore, prices rose and fell, and the trend clearly showed an upward curve. The prospect was that there would be repeated fluctuations as the settlement period approached. Yesterday morning, at the opening of trading, the disbandment bonds rose sharply by 6.5 jiao, while other types of bonds rose less. Twenty rolls and twenty customs duties were held by Number 4. Later, momentum gradually weakened and prices fell. Gold short-term bonds, 22 customs duties, and 96 bonds were all up by more than half a yuan. Market sentiment was mostly uncertain. Seeing prices fall, everyone rushed to sell, and seeing prices rise, everyone rushed to buy. It can be seen that people had no fixed standard. Therefore, a short squeeze or a long squeeze were both possible. Calling it an upward curve is certainly not inappropriate. Looking at the second session, although the previous ones returned to a small decrease of 1-2 jiao to 6 jiao, prices gradually strengthened from the supervision tax forward bonds onward. Moreover, the supervision tax for this month remained unchanged in the first session, and only decreased by 2 jiao in the second session. Market sentiment turned firm, and buying resumed, with prices rising by 3-4 jiao. As a result, market prices showed both rises and falls. Number 96 bonds fell the most, by 7 jiao. This was because a certain trader's floating positions were excessive. The other bonds differed by small amounts, generally around 3-4 jiao. The total number of transactions was approximately 15 million yuan. (Unit: yuan)</p>

<p>Since the continuous rise in government bonds over the past month, prices have recently begun to stagnate. However, there have still been more rises than falls. There are many reasons for this situation, and the future is bound to see repeated fluctuations. Here are the calculated monthly interest rates based on the opening market prices for July bonds this morning (the 19th). Although the cost may increase due to principal repayments and the reduction of interest rates may be higher than this, this table is based on current market prices and is for reference only.</p>
<p>| Bond Market Price | Monthly Interest Rate (Yuan, Fen, Li, Hao, Si) |</p>
<p>|---|---|</p>
<p>| 18 Customs Duties | 30.00 | 0.0848 |</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm Reports: Yesterday (18th), the New York stock market rose due to general optimism about the resolution of the Pacific coast strike and a slight increase in steel production. Mining stocks were the strongest, especially US Steel. However, trading was very quiet. Stocks on the small exchange also rose. Bonds were slightly higher due to the strength of stocks and goods, with mixed results. Chicago wheat first rose due to news of damage to the Canadian wheat crop, and then fell as long positions took profits. The total daily trading volume was 490,000 shares (securities). The market situation continued to improve due to encouraging labor strike news (wheat). Spring wheat news was unfavorable. According to private reports, the Canadian wheat crop has decreased by another 40 million bushels since July 1 (English bushels) (cotton). This week's US government report stated that the western United States urgently needed rain, but the condition of the cotton crop was not as bad as reported outside. Furthermore, labor strike news was better than before, so buyers were hesitant and cautious when prices rose. However, before rain in Texas, the market will not have a major reaction (rubber). Prices were firm due to purchases by industry players and consumers. The Dow Jones index is listed below:</p>

Because Yarn Warehouse Inventory Still Has 35,000 Bales, Although Buyers' Intentions Are Strong, There Is Still No Adequate Solution for This Stock. Consequently, Market Pressure Remains Heavy. Fortunately, Although There Has Been No Large-Scale Development in Current Yarn Sales Recently, Southern Port Purchases Are Still Quite Good, Bringing Some Optimism to People's Hearts. Based on the Current Situation, It Still Cannot Escape a Fluctuating Situation.</p>
<p>(Golden Rooster Returns Slightly)</p>

<p>The Cotton Market Still Appears Weak Because of the Crowded Delivery of Old Cotton, and There Are Many Reports of Factories Reducing or Stopping Work. The Demand for Raw Cotton Has Decreased. Therefore, Old Cotton Inventory Is Increasing. It Is Said That the Exchange Inspection Office Has 60,000 Dan (Jin) of Qualified Cotton. Buyers Have Not Yet Been Found. At the Same Time, American Cotton Arrivals Are Flowing In Steadily. Therefore, People Are Feeling Very Anxious. However, New Cotton Remains Strong Due to Firm American Cotton. Bullish Traders Still Do Not Release Their Holdings. But News from All Sides Indicates Scattered Showers, Benefiting Cotton Use Greatly.</p>
<p>Cotton Auction Deliveries Are Enthusiastic At the Opening of the Cotton Auction Market, American Cotton Rose Again by 3 to 5 Pounds, But Old Cotton, Hubei Cotton, and Our Own Companies Have Sufficient Deliveries, As Much As 50,000 to 60,000 Dan. Factories Lack the Desire to Receive Goods Because Prices Are Too High and the Situation of Yarn Factories Is Not Good. Therefore, Market Sentiment Is Very Weak. As for New Cotton, All Parties Have Received Rain. There Is News of Heavy Rain in Hankou. Because People's Hearts Are Quite Weary, There Are Fewer Buyers. As a Result, Each Month Fell by 1.5 to 2.5 Jiao. The Total Volume of Transactions Was 55,000 Dan. Sales: Dafeng 900 Dan, Shenji 5,600 Dan, Renfeng 1,000 Dan, Changhe 1,000 Dan, Ruiyuan 1,300 Dan.

<h3 id="e278">Flour Futures Bulls Remain Active <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>The Lianbang Also Had Activities. Yesterday in the Flour Market, After Opening in the Morning, the Market for Each Month Presented a Flat and Then High Trend. The Price of Foreign Wheat Was Good by 1 or 2 Jiao in Chicago and About 4 or 5 Jiao in Canada. When the Prices Were Opened, Initially People's Hearts Were Calm Due to Occasional Rainfall. Therefore, Although Foreign Wheat Continued to Report Price Increases, the Market Was Similar to Yesterday. However, This Month, Due to Slight Spot Business in Dalian, the Opening Price of 4 Fen Immediately Increased to 5 Fen. Thus, the Distant Futures Bidding Also Tightened. Furthermore, Large Bullish Traders Outside the Industry Still Made Purchases. It Is Said That the Exchange's Inventory Has Reached Tens of Millions. 40% to 50% of This Belongs to Large Bullish Traders. Therefore, They Manipulated It at Will, Catering to Their Desires. According to the Facts, Prices Initially Rose Due to Drought, but Now Continuous Rainfall in Various Places Seems Appropriate for a Short-Term Retreat, Closer to Reason. However, Human Desires Are Unpredictable, and There Is Fear That the Subsequent Steps Will Still Lack Hope for Amicability. Yesterday's Rebound Was Partly Due to the Activities of the Lianbang and Partly Due to the Pick-Up of Inexperienced Buyers. As a Result, This Month Was Higher by 1 Fen 7 Li, August Was Higher by 2 Fen 7 Li, September Was Higher by 2 Fen, October and November Were Higher by 2 Fen 7 Li, and December Was Higher by 3 Fen 2 Li.</p>
<h3 id="e279">Wheat Rebounded Quite Rapidly <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's Wheat Futures Market, After Opening in the Morning, Showed a Quite Rapid Rebound in Each Month. The Reported Price of Foreign Wheat in Both Chicago and Canada Rose Again by 1 or 2 Jiao to 4 or 5 Jiao. Although Continuous Rainfall Was Seen, It Was All Light Rain and Wind, Insufficient for Penetration. Therefore, People's Hearts Revived, and the Buying Sentiment Became Crazy. It Is Said That Short Sellers in the Industry Are Thinking of Covering Their Positions Because Factory Stomachs Are Very Good. Most Large Outside Traders Are Also Absorbing Continuously. Therefore, the Opening Prices for Each Month Are Rising Step by Step. As a Result, This Month Was Better by 4 Fen, August to November Were All Better by 6 Fen, December Was Better by 4 Fen. Kaixian Should Be Wheat 3 Yuan 2 Jiao 6 Fen, Next 4 Fen, Yaowan Wheat 3 Yuan 2 Jiao 6 or 7 Fen, Guandian Wheat 3 Yuan 2 Jiao 6 Fen, Bangbu Wheat 3 Yuan 2 Jiao 7 Fen, Yuyi Wheat 3 Yuan 2 Jiao 3 Fen, Qingjiang Gaoyou Wheat 3 Yuan 2 Jiao 5 Fen, Daqiao Wheat 3 Yuan 2 Jiao, Xianzhu Wheat 3 Yuan 2 Jiao 8 Fen, Jiangbei Wheat 3 Yuan 1 Jiao 5 Fen, Pukou Wheat 3 Yuan 1 Jiao 5 Fen, Linhuai Guan Wheat 3 Yuan 2 Jiao 7 Fen, Zhumadian 3 Yuan 1 Jiao 8 Fen, Nanjing Wheat 2 Yuan 9 Jiao 7 Fen, Fuxin Took 8,000 Bags, Fufeng Took 3,000 Bags, Shenda Took 1,000 Bags, Xinda Took 2,000 Bags.</p>

<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, the Source of Each Gang Was Still Only More Than Ten Numbers (Goods About 2,000 Yu Shi), and the Sales Market of Each Road Was Also Dull and Unchanging. Moreover, Rainfall Occurred from Time to Time, and People's Hearts Felt Even Weaker. Therefore, on This Street, There Were Few People Visiting the Market as Guests, and the Number of Those Adding Stock Was Also Very Small. Therefore, the Opening of Each Kind of Goods Was Particularly Limited. Although the Arrival of Goods from the Source Was Limited for Several Days, There Was Still a Sense of Over Supply. The Remaining Goods in Pudong Gradually Accumulated Thickly. Its Market Shape Was Quiet. Guest Gangs' Appetite Was Limited. The Qingdao Gang's Appetite Was Also Reduced. They Only Handled Si Jing Special Thin, About a Hundred or Ten Packages, and the Eating Plate Was Strict. As a Result, the Prices of Each Gang of Thick Jing and Late Rice, Etc., Done in Retail and Wholesale, Were Again Downstream by One Jiao to Two or Three Jiao. Duyang Jian Was More Actively Available Due to More Arrivals. Sellers Were Extremely Anxious to Get Rid of It, Resulting in a Cut of Half a Yuan. Only Yin Bian Yuan Relied on Similar Supply and Demand. The Situation Was Slightly Weak. (Shanghai North) Yesterday, There Were Thirteen or Fourteen Numbers of Goods from Various Places in Hexia. The Departure of All Colors on the Market Was Miserable. The High White Jing on the Market Barely Stood. Medium and Secondary Prices Were Cut by Varying Amounts of Three or Four Jiao. Early Thin Rice Prices Fell by Four or Five Jiao. Bai Yuan Arrival Was Rare, Slightly Flat and Exhausted. Yang Du Jian Followed Xiao Er San Jiao. Ke Jian Also Xiao Yi Jiao or So.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Foreign Ke Xian Market Was Also Quite Active. Because This Street Continued to Have Social Activities, Inland Gangs Were Busy, and Northern and Zhejiang Gangs Also Arrived on the Market to Handle Loading. However, Stockpiling Households on This Street Have Already Stagnated. The Northern Gang Slightly Handled Ji Jing. The Zhejiang Gang Had a Little Ke Cao Transaction. The Numbers Were Not Many. Inland Gangs Were Concerned With Both Ji Cao and Foreign Rice. However, Ke Xian From the Yangtze River Continued to Arrive in Shanghai, Just in Time for Rainfall and a Large Order of Foreign Rice. Market Prices Were Slightly Pulled Down by One Jiao. Therefore, Yesterday's Rain and Foreign Rice Orders Were Really Beneficial to the Panic Situation of Recent Days. The Whole City Opened Up 3,000 Packages of Cao Rice, 3,000 More Packages of Ji Rice. Xiao Jiaomi Traded 5,000 Packages. Xiao Jiaomi Is Difficult to Align Because the Newly Ordered Foreign Rice Is Already Difficult to Align. People's Hearts Turned Stable Again. Yesterday, the Opening Was 8 Yuan 5 Jiao Half to 8 Yuan 4 Jiao Half. There Was No Difference From the Previous Market.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the First Batch of Hankou New Seed Green Beans Arrived, Totalling 120 Packages. Because of the Drought This Year, the Goods Were Still Very Dry, But the Seeds Were Weak, and This Batch Had Heavy Mud and Ash. Therefore, Buyers Were Not Greedy, Resulting in No Sales. There Were No Goods in Jiujiang New Beans and a Lack of Market. Old Beans Were Insufficient Because Rainfall in Various Townships Was Not Thorough, and Cake Sales Were Not Brisk. Factories Took a Wait-and-See Approach. Therefore, People's Hearts Tended to Weaken. Yesterday's Market Transaction Volume Was Very Scarce. The Total Market Included One Cart of Zhengyangguan Beans, Priced at 3 Yuan, One Cart of Feihe Beans, Priced at 2 Yuan 9 Jiao, and One Cart of Yingzhou Beans, Priced at 2 Yuan 8 Jiao. They Were All Walked Away by Retail Households.</p>

<p>Opening Price Fell by Three or Four Yuan The First Batch of New Jinshan Branches Was Priced High Because Only Hundreds of Boxes Arrived, But the Second Batch Suddenly Increased to More Than a Thousand. Therefore, the Market Trend Turned Loose. The First Two Days Have Been Fully Opened As Numbered, Lower Than the Previous Board by Three or Four Yuan, the Upper Grade Yuan Coins Were 44 Yuan 4 Jiao, Secondary to 36 or 7 Yuan, Wild Mountain Branches Were Mostly Within 30 Yuan, Flat Branches About 50 Yuan.</p>
<p>The First Batch of New Zhangzhou Branches Also Opened Yesterday, The Market Situation Was Still Good Due to the Small Number. It Was Calculated That the Orchid Bamboo Branches Were Large, Opening at 40 Yuan, Wuye Branches 25 Yuan 8 Jiao, Early Red Branches Opened at 20 Yuan Half Because They Were Very Soft. The Later Market Will Be More Relaxed Upon Arrival.</p>

Jinlong Foreign Firm Also Made Huge Ingestions of Pingshui Pearl Tea. The Green Tea Market Suddenly Showed an Active Scene. However, the Selling Price of Tunxi Zhenmei Shrank to 96 Yuan, and the Selling Price of Pingshui Pearl Tea Shrank to 73 Yuan, An Average Drop of Four or Five Yuan More Than Before. Chinese Tea Merchants Suffered Great Losses. Although Transactions in Qining and Lianghu Wenzhou and Other Roads of Black Tea Were Smooth, the Selling Board Was Also Slightly Lower Than Before.</p>

<p>— Original Work by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>As mentioned above, all female officials were daughters of high-ranking Manchu officials; my younger sister Rongling and I were the beloved daughters of Duke Yugeng. My father received orders from the court very early to serve as ambassador to various countries: therefore, we received Western education from an early age. Please forgive my boasting! At that time, there were truly very few women like us who were able to understand foreign languages: therefore, the Empress Dowager valued us sisters particularly highly; and others envied us to the extreme! Although there were no special titles such as "Chief Female Official" at the time, in fact, we could indeed be regarded as leaders of all female officials.</p>
<p>Two of the female officials were daughters of Prince Qing. At that time, Prince Qing was serving as Minister of Military Affairs, so naturally he was also a very, very big official! There was also a Shun Wang Consort. Speaking of this person's background, it was also very significant. She and Empress Longyu were biological sisters, and the Empress Dowager was also her aunt, so the relationship should have been very close: the reason she was selected to enter the palace and serve as a female official was because the Empress Dowager wanted to give some benefits to her own relatives. In this case, the Empress Dowager must have been very considerate of her own relatives. However, the opposite was true! I don't know why! I still haven't understood it until now, or perhaps it was a kind of neuropsychiatric disorder! She hated those members of the imperial family and her own mother's family, those close relatives, with a vengeance. Although she held all the power in China and could change any official at will, she never allowed any of her relatives to hold a position that was relatively important and easy to make money; therefore, all relatives who had a direct relationship with her, except for a very small minority, were mostly as poor as the lower class.</p>
<p>One more thing worth mentioning is that before her death, the Empress Dowager felt especially bitter animosity towards Puyi! That is, Puyi who is currently working as a "puppet" for the Japanese in the three northeastern provinces (Translator's note: The author's original text also writes "Japan's Puppet" in large letters, which can give Europeans and Americans a deep impression, which is gratifying. Gratifying.)! Whenever someone mentioned them, she would frown and be unhappy. (87)</p>
<h3 id="e289">A Record of a Strange Old Woman <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— &gt;Qing Shou</p>
<p>In our Jiading area, there is an old woman in Dongli who, to tell the truth, is strange: readers, don't think that I am making up a fictitious story, but in fact it is very true, without any embellishment; the old woman's surname is Zhu, and she is already over seventy years old. When her old man was alive, he had a moderate amount of property, but he was extremely stingy, and he would not spend a penny on anything in vain; even if he sold a copper coin's worth of tofu, he would divide it into two days to eat. For example, today he would first pay a copper coin, take only five coins' worth of tofu, and have half left to take tomorrow; can you imagine! Isn't he an economic expert? What's strange is that in the year before the old man died, he suddenly started a major construction project, building a high-hall large house, but unfortunately, not many days after its completion, death descended, and he became a guest of the heavenly court; moreover, he had no biological children, so all the real estate and land were naturally enjoyed by the collateral branches of the same clan; now, the old woman! Only a pair of old bones is left, and she seems to be suffering a tragic fate of loneliness and isolation. What is the reason for this? Such an old person's temperament naturally would not be harmonious with the daughters-in-law, so she had to live alone; it is said that these days, when the temperature reaches one hundred and four degrees, how afraid of heat is the old woman, but the upper half of her body is already naked, and she is holding cotton trousers in her hand, her feet are on a burning red copper stove, and she is still shouting that her feet are cold; those who don't know would think she is suffering from mental illness, but in fact, although she is old, her mind is still one hundred and twenty points clear! Some people say that her upper body is living in summer, and her lower body is still living in winter. If we talk about her unique physiology, we might as well determine that she has a double personality, so I wrote her out to offer readers a smile.</p>
<h3 id="e290">Rural Night Scene <a href="#e290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— Ding</p>
<p>As soon as the sun sets, the fields are bustling with activity, and it's the farmers' happy time to go home and rest.</p>
<p>The men use coarse cloth dipped in river water to wipe away the dirt on their bodies on the river bank. All the fatigue and exhaustion have been washed away with the dirt. A low platform made of a board and four wooden strips is placed in front of each house; a dish of salted broad beans, a bamboo basket of cold rice, and a small jar of iced tea, which is refreshing and simple. As long as you take a glance at how they eat, you will surely believe that these things taste much better than the delicacies of mountains and seas in the city.</p>
<p>Sparks flying out of the pile of firewood are flashing like fireflies on the edge of the field. The cool breeze of the summer night brings lightness and comfort. The old people are chatting idly without any restrictions with their water pipes; starting from the enthronement of Emperor Xuantong, they talk about the trivial sesame seed and mung bean matters in the village. Sometimes even those moldy and rotten past events of years or decades ago will be revived in their dry toothless mouths. The young men lie naked on the door panels looking at the clear sky, and in the blue sky are the smiles of the girls they yearn for. The children are chopping the grass that will be fed to the plowing cattle tomorrow, and of course there are bound to be quarrels with each other. Mixed with shy laughter, what makes people feel a special flavor is that those innocent village girls are learning to sing love songs that they occasionally hear from the city. I say that the rural night scene in early summer is a picture full of poetic meaning.</p>

<p>Chapter Thirty-Two Enjoying Themselves With Singing and Dancing The General Enjoys Himself All Day, Old and Young Sobbing, How Many Soldiers Return</p>
<p>After eight o'clock, suddenly the sounds of silk strings, drums, and clappers were noisy, and the voices of men and women singing the ballad book continued until two o'clock in the evening before stopping. Guizhi thought to herself that it was just a rich family, with some happy event at home, enjoying themselves at any time, and she didn't pay attention to it. The next morning, she put the newly moved-in set of small stove in the yard and swept it with a long broom. Suddenly, a person stretched a head out from the side yard door and smiled, "Oh! A new neighbor has moved in." Guizhi looked at the woman, wearing a blue cloth short fur coat and a blue cloth apron, like a maid from a high-class family, so she nodded and said, "We are new here. Do you live here too?" The woman pointed to the Western-style building upstairs and said, "Look! I live upstairs." Guizhi smiled, "Oh! Then we are really neighbors. Did you have something happy at your mansion last night?" The woman said, "No! Why do you ask?" Guizhi said, "I heard singing and playing upstairs until late at night, so I guessed that way." The woman smiled, "That's nothing. When our concubine throws a tantrum, she wants the moon, and our division commander doesn't dare to give her the stars. It's funny to say, last night, our division commander came back a little late and missed dinner. He originally said he would take the concubine to eat at a restaurant and listen to a play, but he made the concubine wait for a while. She was unyielding and just threw a temper tantrum. No matter how carefully the division commander coaxed her, it was no use. The division commander had no choice but to find a group of ballad singers to make noise at home for the whole night, and that was considered relieving the concubine's boredom." Ms. Jiang was also in the kitchen next door, also gossiping. Hearing this, she also teased, "This is really new." The woman said, "It's not new..." She still wanted to explain the reason why it wasn't new, but because someone in the front shop was calling, the woman left. Here, the mother and daughter were taking care of things in the kitchen, chatting idly. Guizhi smiled, "Listen, rich people are too good at enjoying themselves, with nothing to do, they just sing and make noise at home. I say, the Western-style building across the street is too lively, it turns out they are a division commander." (438)</p>

<p>One night, it was already after three o'clock, and Mr. Wang in the parlor building was going home through the back door. Although Mr. Wang had a proper job, because he was addicted to gambling, drinking, and whoring outside, his family's finances were very tight, and this was the main reason why he and his wife often quarreled and fought.</p>
<p>That night, Mr. Wang returned home in the middle of the night, constantly yawning, eager to restore the fatigue of not sleeping well for several nights, but Mrs. Wang refused to let him off lightly, so when Mr. Wang had just taken off his hat, she stretched out her hand and asked him for the rent and food expenses that had been overdue.</p>
<p>Although these are necessities of life in every family, Mr. Wang's pockets were empty, because that night, Mr. Wang had lost all the money in his pockets. There was no money in his pocket, and he couldn't deal with it, so Mrs. Wang began to sob.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang had already been feeling sullen because he had lost in gambling, and now seeing Mrs. Wang crying, he simply opened his mouth and started scolding people. Mrs. Wang had already suffered grievances, and at this point she began to cry to the heavens and wail loudly. This was followed by the crisp sound of slaps, the heavy sound of throwing objects, mixed with the terrified cries of the child after being awakened, calling for her mother, all mixed together.

<p>— Wei Yongchi</p>
<p>Mung beans, according to the "Materia Medica," are mild and can relieve summer heat and quench thirst. Drinking its juice in summer prevents many diseases. I don't use mung bean soup for a reason. There is also a reason for relief from summer heat soup. It's because in "Dream of the Red Chamber," there's a passage about the characters' deep emotions: Daiyu and Baoyu each have secrets in their hearts, but they are difficult to express. Now, Baoyu hears Daiyu say the words "good marriage" and becomes even more contrary. He angrily grits his teeth, takes off the jade pendant around his neck, throws it, and smashes it. Daiyu is even more anxious when she sees him smashing that dumb thing. Fortunately, Xiren rushes to take it away and jokingly persuades Baoyu, "You and your sister are quarreling; there's no need to smash it. If it's smashed, how will she be able to face people?" When Daiyu hears this, it strikes a chord in her heart. It shows that Baoyu isn't even as good as Xiren, and she begins to cry even more sadly. Being troubled, she can't even handle the relief from summer heat soup she just drank and vomits it up. From this, we can see that in the Grand View Garden, mung bean soup is also used to relieve summer heat. I have excerpted it here to prove that mung bean soup can relieve summer heat, and even Lin Daiyu drinks it, showing its true value. Therefore, I don't use the title "Mung Bean Soup," but borrow the title "Relief from Summer Heat Soup" to cleverly choose a title, as it was vomited up along with the fragrant saliva from her mouth. Enough of idle talk; let's get back to the main topic.</p>
<p>Mung bean soup is a food that, every summer, regardless of rich or poor, large or small households, is consumed because it is inexpensive and beneficial, and also because of customs. Before the use of cold drinks from abroad led to the spread of diseases, southerners, in addition to considering watermelon a good companion for relieving summer heat, considered this the best method for relieving summer heat. But once autumn arrives, people fear getting diarrhea from eating watermelon and stop eating it. If an Indian summer arrives, they still use this as a remedy. However, there are great differences in how mung bean soup and mung bean porridge are cooked. Here are the results of my research to share with readers:</p>
<p>It is said that an essential condition for mung bean soup is that the amount of water added during the initial cooking must be precise. For example, to make a soup with one liter of mung beans, you must add three and a half or four liters of water, which is just right. If you are cooking mung bean porridge, because you add a handful of rice, you must have four full liters of water. Whether it's soup or porridge, you must use high heat at first until it boils, then reduce the heat to simmer it through, until the beans are fully bloomed. Then, use domestic cane sugar, blend it well, and after it comes out of the pot, drink it slightly cooled. It tastes excellent. The worst thing is to not add enough water at the beginning and then add water when it's partially cooked, as its taste is completely different from that of the ones without adding water. If you don't believe me, try it, and you'll know it's true.</p>
<h3 id="e294">Summer's Economical Drinks <a href="#e294" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c294" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">294</a></h3>
<p>— Linghu Zhao</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "When hungry, think of food; when thirsty, think of drink." "Drink" and "food" are two necessities of life. In noble Shanghai, the general working-class people are very "careful" about both food and drink because their finances don't allow them to spend recklessly! For example, in dance halls and restaurants, a bowl of mung bean soup or a cup of iced coffee costs one yuan, while those frozen oranges sold by peddlers on the street are expensive, so the average working class doesn't dare to eat or drink them. Although the latter are cheap, they are harmful to health. Therefore, I have recorded several extremely economical, hygienic, and beneficial drinks to offer to readers.</p>
<p>(1) Barley Tea: Roast one liter of barley in a pot until it turns brown, preserving its properties. Steep in boiling water. It has the fragrant taste of coffee, but none of the bitterness of tea leaves. It can clear the mind and awaken the spleen, preventing summer heat. It is beneficial and harmless to drink often in summer.</p>
<p>(2) Honeysuckle Dew: Buy a handful of honeysuckle and chrysanthemum at a pharmacy, add one or two fresh spearmint leaves, and one or two slices of licorice. Steep in boiling water. After it cools, it has a sweet and pleasant taste. It can eliminate summer heat, and drinking it for a long time can prevent boils.</p>
<p>(3) Chrysanthemum Tea: Steep a handful of dried chrysanthemum flowers with a little white sugar (not too much, as too much will be too sweet and harmful) in boiling water. After it cools, drink it. It is cooling and fragrant, and its effect is the same as honeysuckle dew.</p>
<p>(4) Cold Boiled Water: Boil clear water and let it cool before drinking. It is more beneficial than street drinks.</p>

<h3 id="e295">The Thorough Liberation of Women's Professions <a href="#e295" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c295" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">295</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Xu</p>
<p>Everyone must admit that Chinese society is still a male-dominated society.</p>
<p>In name or on the surface, women have already been liberated. There are female members of the Central Committee, female civil servants, female employees, and female workers. In politics, economics, and education, women and men supposedly have equal opportunities and equal rights, and it seems that a truly equal state has been achieved.</p>
<p>But in reality, we can see that the underside of women's professions (including civil servants, employees, etc.) is covered with a thick layer of "decorations," "shop signs," and other colors, making them inevitably reduced to "flower vases." Is this the fault of women themselves? Thousands of years of male-dominated society have limited women's consciousness. Feudal poisons have determined women's fate. In some corners of the world, women are still bought and sold as commodities, and beautiful faces are used as a means of attracting customers. The view of women as commodities is still unavoidable.</p>
<p>The so-called "pleasure professions" of dancing girls are not for everyone. At the very least, they must possess the following conditions: (1) a beautiful face, (2) a slender figure, (3) the ability to go to extremes in decoration and affectation. Of course, there are other conditions, but there is no need to list them all. In short, it is only necessary to be able to win the love of a large number of men, satisfy every man's desire, and obtain a rich price. Therefore, the so-called "women in pleasure professions" are nothing more than "sexual commodities."</p>
<p>The tide of the global economic panic has shaken every corner, making it impossible for many women to live peacefully at home. At the same time, some women see the future crisis and try their best to shout out "women's liberation!" At the same time, some men also feel that the burden is too heavy, and there is a risk that they will not be able to bear it in the future, so they also shout "women should be liberated." Women who have been oppressed for thousands of years will naturally find it difficult to please when they want to compete and win in a "male-dominated society."</p>
<p>However, women are as complex as men in society. No matter how fast the wheel of the times turns, no matter how many women are abandoned far away, no matter how many women fall into the abyss of commodities, at the same time, many women are running ahead of the times, working hard and struggling.</p>
<p>The reason why women flow into "commodities" is, as Mr. "Bo'er" said, "the inadequacy of the social system." However, it cannot be corrected by Mr. "Xin's" simple "breaking vanity" and "promoting thrift" because, once you have become a capitalist's "commodity," you are not allowed to freely "break" or "promote." Because "breaking" means breaking your own rice bowl, and frugality will cut off your profession. This is a conflict of interest with the capitalists. This, of course, does not mean that working women should not be thrifty, but rather that this is possible under this situation.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is even more difficult than ascending to heaven for working women in a subordinate position (including women seeking employment) to demand absolute economic independence, especially in this society of frequent disasters, national economic bankruptcy, and widespread unemployment.</p>
<p>It is certainly not a matter for women alone to reform the inadequacy of the entire social system. However, to demand the liberation of women's professions, the "male-dominated society" must be changed into a "gender-shared society."</p>
<h3 id="e296">Confined or Drifting? <a href="#e296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>— Hong Ben</p>
<p>Brother ××:</p>
<p>I have received your letter full of grief for a long time. Why haven't I replied? It's not because I'm busy. I'm bored beyond words. Because school is on vacation, and I don't want to engage in other pursuits, so I'm naturally very idle. But why am I even too lazy to reply to your letter? This makes me feel very difficult. Because the question you raised is really too serious: is it better to stick to your homeland or to drift outside?</p>
<p>This is a serious question. I thought about it for a long time before I came to a decision. Now I will write it down:</p>
<p>Originally, there are now many people shouting, "Go back to the countryside," and "Go to the people." The former seems to have started recently, probably because the countryside has become so bankrupt in recent years that they believe that if China is to have a solution in the future, it must start with the revival of the countryside, so some people shouted this slogan. The latter is indeed an old tune, a slogan of those literary people. In this way, those who have already drifted outside should return to their nests. So, what illusions do you have who are originally in the nest? Stay put, fugitives, stay put!</p>
<p>However, that's not the case. My opinion is exactly the opposite. Oh, brother ××, hearing this, I imagine you must be smiling approvingly and drawing me as a close friend! Yes, this is not my speculation. Why do I not advocate that you stick to your homeland? Why do I agree to drift outside? I don't just have a conclusion without a premise. Let's look at my arguments below!</p>
<p>Didn't you say yourself that your hometown is so dangerous, the people are so cold, everyone thinks that you have studied at the university, so they all look at you like a dragon, but in fact, you are so disappointing to them, because you cannot be promoted and get rich because you have studied at the university, to prove that their theory that reading is useful. And you can't even make elegiac couplets, so they look down on you so much. How can you stick with that?</p>
<p>If you were rich, it would be easier to plan. You can have old rice to eat yourself, close the door and sit at home, pretending to be blind and deaf, ignoring people's jokes and scolding. That would be fine.</p>
<p>However, if that were really the case, it would be too depressing to lose the meaning of life. The dark world and chaotic society desperately need us to transform it. However, the fact is so cruel, how easy is it to transform? If you want to shoulder this responsibility with your own strength, it will not only not help the facts, but also plunge yourself into the abyss. Because this is not a branch issue, nor a people issue, but the entire social system issue. If the big premise has no way out, how can you talk about branches? Isn't it bound to hit a wall! And now, the power of the old forces in the countryside is even stronger than before, enough to lead young people astray at any time. Moreover, if you are really rich, you will basically fall by yourself.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, and also best of all, you are not only not rich, but you are actually penniless. From your letter, I can see that even with the low standard of living in the countryside, you are almost experiencing the crisis of "being in a difficult situation." Since you are so poor, what do you still love about your homeland? Looking closely at your tone, it seems that you have some resentment towards your own destiny. In fact, this is wrong. In this vast world, there are countless people who are as destitute as you. This responsibility clearly rests with society.</p>
<p>I think, friend, you should drift outside. You can only drift outside. But if you ask me what certainty there is in coming outside, what way out is there? Then I will honestly say that there are indeed no concrete benefits either. But I always feel that a living young person is better off starving to death in a foreign land than being poor at home. I have always held this idea. From the age of sixteen to now, I have been drifting for a full eight years. Although I have starved, I have still survived. And in terms of spirit, knowledge, and everything else, I have indeed gained a lot of benefits.</p>
<p>That's why I am persuading you to go outside. I feel that a modern young person should fully taste</p>
<p>Yes, it is necessary to accept a lesson in wandering. I also feel that so-called wandering, drifting, is not just a bad thing. On the other hand, it is harboring infinite truths and infinite progressive consciousness.</p>
<p>Brother ××, my dear friend, what are you going to do? I have babbled such a big set of things. Is it really to your taste? Does it match your views? Finally, I have one sentence to say. The world and society are never forever dark and forever chaotic. There will always be a day when light is released, over, I wish you health. Your friend, Hong Ben</p>
<h3 id="e297">In Memory of Liu Bannong <a href="#e297" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c297" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">297</a></h3>
<p>— Maohua</p>
<p>Chinese phonology expert Dr. Liu Fu died at 2:10 PM on the 14th of this month at Peking Union Medical College Hospital. People in academic circles, both well-known and unknown, across the country are writing articles of mourning, expressing their sorrow. Because I have the bond of being from the same hometown as Dr. Liu Fu, I know a little about his life, so I would like to talk about his early years of diligent study.</p>
<p>Liu Fu, also known as Bannong, lived in Sanjiali, Dongxiang, Jiangyin. However, his father moved to Xidajie in the city. After graduating from Liyan School, he went to Changzhou Fifth Middle School to study. Because he had some talent, he did not submit to the guidance of those old-fashioned teachers, so he did not graduate. After leaving Fifth Middle School, he came to Shanghai to translate novels (at that time, he signed his name as Liu Bannong, which was quite like a "Mandarin Ducks and Butterflies" style). Until now, we can still buy Liu's translated novels "Cat Detective," "Secret History of Continental Europe," "Account in the Tent," and "Black Shoulder Scarf" at the Zhonghua Book Company. Soon, he was appreciated by Cai Yuanpei, the president of Peking University, who felt it was a pity that he was stranded in Shanghai, so he asked him to work in the Peking University Library. There, Mr. Liu Fu had the opportunity to come into contact with the vast sea of learning. Needless to say, the foundation for becoming a specialized scholar was laid at that time.</p>
<p>As Mr. Liu Fu's knowledge improved, President Cai Yuanpei asked him to be a teaching assistant at Peking University. However, due to a lack of qualifications, he was occasionally ridiculed by students who were too high and mighty. Naturally, Mr. Liu Fu did not do it. By chance, with the help of President Cai Yuanpei, he went to study in France.</p>
<p>I don't remember clearly whether it was five or six years in that country. Mr. Liu Fu obtained a French state-recognized doctorate in literature and returned to China. It is said that the French state-recognized doctorate in literature was still the first in the Far East, which is to say that even Japan, which is bright in academics, did not have it. At that time, there was a war in our Jiangyin. The Feng Army bombed the Binta built by Wu Guotai (Sun Quan's mother). However, it did not completely bomb it, but only bombed half of the spire. The upper half of the spire looked like a pen tip, so the local people said, "Jiangyin has produced a foreign champion!" And the so-called foreign champion, of course, refers to Dr. Liu Fu.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Fu was a famous doctor. Universities would naturally compete to recruit him, fearing that they would be too late. It was truly incomparable to when he had not gone abroad. During this time, Dr. Liu Fu personally participated in the May Fourth Movement, using the pen name Liu Bannong to write and promote with novelists Lu Xun, etc., and using his spare time from studying phonology to write poems in dialect (such as the famous Wafu Collection). As a result, Liu Bannong became a well-known poet and writer.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, Mr. Liu Bannong passed away in his prime! Mr. Chen Zizhan believes that this is a major loss in the construction of the mass language issue, and I share the same feeling.</p>
<p>Seeing Mr. Liu Bannong's life experience, without any further explanation, we can know how hard-working and diligent he was. And his younger brother, Mr. Tianhua, was the same. As a teacher in a small school who couldn't even play the piano, he became a German doctor of music and became one of China's most famous musicians! If it weren't for diligent study, how would he have achieved success?</p>
<p>However, their brothers passed away one after another, which makes us offer our infinite condolences.</p>

<p>— Chen Yi</p>
<p>When the whistle blew, the sun's red face was already covered by the sharp top of the Great Coal Mountain. A thick black shadow covered this vast plain. The sun-baked river water and the white smoke of the round fields gradually</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>reduced its heat. The birds in the forest also began to fly in flocks in the sky.</p>
<p>When the whistle blew, the distant villages, the scattered huts on the plains, and countless messy chimneys were all emitting wisps of thick smoke, winding around the roofs. The yellow-faced village women and the thin children, some holding shovels and bamboo baskets, and some holding hoes and water buckets, were in the fields, in the forests, collecting their firewood and food, and irrigating their wheat fields and vegetable gardens.</p>
<p>When the whistle blew, the street lying beside the railway gradually became lively; the people coming and going included workers and village women, old people and children. The shop assistants in the stores were shouting loudly, and the waiters in the teahouses were moving around to greet customers. Of the twenty-four hours in a day, only this moment is a lively world. The silent air became noisy, and the stagnant money flowed everywhere.</p>
<p>When the whistle blew, the chains of the elevator spun incessantly, and one small car after another of coal was hoisted from underground to the side of the mountain. The workers doing the transportation work were all waving beads of sweat. Pushing the coal cars that weighed two hundred pounds, they didn't care that they were covered in sweat, and they forgot that they were barefoot on the coal dust on the ground. It was only because the last train was about to depart, and the empty carriages were waiting for them to transport coal to fill them.</p>
<p>When the whistle blew, a group of workers stood around the elevator. The workers who were going to work were chatting cheerfully about their lives, some eating the hardened biscuits and steamed buns. But those who were going off work were all covered in coal dust and sweat, tiredly bowing their heads and panting, holding up the dimly lit carbide lamps, and dragging their heavy steps on their way home.</p>
<p>When the whistle blew, everything within these few miles of people and things was shaken.</p>
<h3 id="e299">Peach <a href="#e299" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c299" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">299</a></h3>
<p>— Cun Yin</p>
<p>The peach tree bore fruit.</p>
<p>How happy Asheng was in his heart!</p>
<p>Sprouting, flowering, bearing fruit... selling, making money, buying rice, filling his belly... He thought about these things every day.</p>
<p>This time, he saw many peaches hanging on the peach tree. Ah, how lucky he should be!</p>
<p>Before they were ripe, he had already picked them. He carefully packed them one by one into a basket, and couldn't bear not to eat one himself.</p>
<p>There were only four trees, and he had to rely on them to live for a year.</p>
<p>He was so old, it was fortunate that his body was not too sick.</p>
<p>He picked a good day to carry the load to the city. Along the way, he thought about many things. He even thought about buying a silk short shirt with the remaining money! He also thought about hiring a mason to repair the leaks in his old house.</p>
<p>He also hated his untrimmed long hair and beard.</p>
<p>Some of the peaches were red. The rest were not very ripe. They had all left their hometown and were left for people to eat. In their little hearts, perhaps they would resent people for being too brutal!</p>
<p>Asheng shed a lot of sweat and finally stopped in a lively place.</p>
<p>After wiping his sweat, he opened his broken</p>
<p>throat and shouted...</p>
<p>"Want to buy peaches? Sweet peaches!..."</p>
<p>Almost everyone who passed by his load of peaches at least glanced at him. Because his voice was so pitiful! And also unusually calm.</p>
<p>From morning to noon, he only got twenty or so copper coins.</p>
<p>His old heart was already panicking!</p>
<p>The sun was violently shining on the street. It also shone on the muscles of every hard-working person. Only those in the cars were comfortably living their luxurious dreams.</p>
<p>Dusk was near! He kept shouting.</p>
<p>How anxious he was in his heart! Although he could come out to sell again tomorrow!</p>
<p>When his throat could not make a sound, the sun had already escaped.</p>
<p>He sighed and carried the heavy load back.</p>
<p>Not eating for a day was not unusual for him.</p>
<p>The next day, he carried the load to the city again in the morning.</p>
<p>The sun had not yet climbed to the top of his head.</p>
<p>A policeman interfered with him with a stick.</p>
<p>"This is the place to walk! You can't..."</p>
<p>"Sir, small business people..."</p>
<p>He frowned and begged in a pitiful way.</p>
<p>"No way! The police raised his stick and hit him."</p>
<p>Suddenly, a red mark appeared on Asheng's back. He pressed on the painful area and knelt down.</p>
<p>"Sir, poor people... need to eat..."</p>
<p>"Carry it away quickly! Otherwise..."</p>
<p>"Sir..."</p>
<p>Asheng went up to hug his leg and begged.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, a kick! The leather shoe with nails! It kicked him right in the chest.</p>
<p>He was in extreme pain! He quickly carried it away.</p>
<p>Running home. He was already panting very badly!</p>
<p>He just passed out like that.</p>
<p>When he woke up, he vomited many blood clots, staining his lower beard red.</p>
<p>He didn't know what was going on.</p>
<p>"I didn't rob money or kill anyone...?"</p>
<p>He often asked himself lightly...</p>
<p>A few days later, the unripe peaches in the basket were rotting!</p>

<p>— Bin Fu</p>
<p>For the past few days, I have been extremely frustrated and irritable. At night, I can't sleep well due to the threat of heat and the torment of bedbugs. During the day, I try to find a shady spot to lie down on a rattan chair for a nap, but those red-headed, sesame-sized fly "generals" refuse to let me go. They insist on buzzing and crawling all over my face, ears, armpits, and between my toes, incessantly buzzing and stinging.</p>
<p>Especially when I am just about to drift off to sleep, these creatures unexpectedly land on any part of my body and take a bite, causing me to jump up suddenly and break out in a sweat. By the time I grab a banana leaf fan to swat at them, they have already zipped away without a trace. This endless torment has left me both laughing and crying, and I am almost driven to madness.</p>
<p>During meals, before people have even sat down, those generals have already rudely landed on the food. If you shoo them away, they will madly make a big circle in the air, and it's impossible to track where they go. After circling, they seem to think that you are no longer chasing them, and then quickly fly back to squat on the corner of the table or in the center of the bowl. What's even more annoying is when you have just picked up a small dish of side dishes and are about to put it in your mouth, that red-headed fly happens to land on the dish, and you have to put down the side dish and chase away the fly. Isn't this kind of disgusting disruption enough to make people uncomfortable?</p>
<p>This is just in terms of their superficial actions, which are already enough to make us so disgusted. If we look at them from a scientific perspective, what toxic and terrifying creatures they are! They carry infectious germs; they are nothing less than assassins of humanity!</p>
<p>In this situation, we no longer have the inclination to savor Kobayashi Issa's "Don't hit the fly, it's rubbing its hands, rubbing its feet."</p>
<p>So we bought a lot of fly swatters and mobilized the whole family to swat and kill all flies, big and small. Strangely, it seems like the flies can't be killed completely. After swatting one group, another group flies in. Their tireless spirit of persistence sometimes really amazes us. Sometimes, looking at the corpses of flies all over the ground and the overflowing goo, we don't feel any cruelty at all, but just think that this goo contains our blood and sweat, and we can't help but feel a pang of pain and resentment.</p>
<p>Ah! Flies! You soulless, unambitious creatures! People hate you, and you don't care. People despise you, and you don't even know it! You are such opportunistic and shameless creatures! As soon as you see something sweet in the east, you buzz and fly to the east; as soon as you see something sweet in the west, you drill to the west! You insidious, heartless creatures! You scrape people's blood, suck people's sweat, and gorge on people's fat, and yet you still want to transmit life-destroying toxins to them!</p>
<p>Ah, you most opportunistic, most insidious, most soulless, heartless, shameless disgusting creatures, seeing that the weather is getting colder, let's see how long you can run rampant!</p>

<p>— Ma Ying</p>
<p>Shadow—a lost companion:</p>
<p>You said, in this chaotic world, on this long road filled with thorns, shouldn't we walk hand in hand?</p>
<p>I think you can't deny this, and we did accompany each other in groping in the dark for a very short period of time. I still remember clearly that we were blinded by the wind and sand, our hands and feet were stabbed by thorns, we both let out struggling roars, and both of our ears could hear this sound. Then I should ask you: since you helped me so much in the past, why did you leave me without saying goodbye now?</p>
<p>I think you might deny all those past things, you might say that we never walked together, and you never helped me. Yes, you will overturn those things completely, leaving only me shedding tears of despair, leaving you in the distant, distant…</p>
<p>However, I will never forget the influence you gave me! It was you who helped me break out of that cage, it was you who led me onto the so-called road of life. This is such a heartbreaking thing, you left me on this halfway that is as empty as the land of death, and you left alone!</p>
<p>It's fine if you left, but why did you pretend to comfort me with that fake face before you left? You said, "Wait, I'll be back in a while." My eyes watched you leave, and my heart hoped that you would come back immediately, but now I know that you lied to me.</p>
<p>"Shadow! Are you really so cruel to let me fall into the abyss of despair, and let venomous snakes and beasts devour my soul? Are you willing to erase all the help you gave me before?"</p>
<p>I kept roaring madly. If you can hear my voice in another darkness, please come back to me immediately!</p>

<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I am a young man with a weak will. After graduating from elementary school in 1932, when I was only fifteen years old, I dropped out of school and stayed at home because of financial difficulties, so I couldn't continue my studies. Later, my uncle recommended me to work as an apprentice in the Zengyu New Cigarette Shop in Caojiadu, western Shanghai. I often suffered all kinds of verbal abuse in the shop, which was really unbearable. I wanted to quit, but I was afraid that my parents would not allow it, so I just muddled through. Time flies like an arrow, and the days pass like a shuttle. It has been more than two years since I started my apprenticeship. The manager often goes against me. A few weeks ago, when he saw the toothpaste I was using, he said that I stole money to buy it. This sentence really scared me out of my wits. He is deliberately trying to harm me, making it difficult for me to continue working or quit. I am indecisive and think that I should just commit suicide. But perhaps you, sir, have a proper solution, so please give me a practical answer.</p>
<p>Respectfully wishing you</p>
<p>Peace, Wu Dade bows</p>
<p>Answer: It is very common for apprentices to be bullied by the boss. To commit suicide because of this is really taking your own life too lightly.</p>
<p>I think the problem you are facing now is not "quitting" or "muddling through," but what kind of attitude to take in the future towards the boss's unwarranted insults and grievances. If you quit out of anger, he will not suffer any loss and may even say that you are guilty of theft and have no face to stay. But you yourself will suffer the pain of unemployment and your parents' disapproving looks. What is the point of that? If, at the time, he said that the toothpaste you were using was "bought with stolen money," you should have questioned him with a spirit of sacrifice, without being vague. You should ask him: "How do you know that I bought toothpaste with your stolen money? Can't I buy it myself without stealing money? What evidence do you have to say that I stole money?" These questions should be answered by him thoroughly and concretely. In this way, even if he becomes angry and dismisses you, it is still worthwhile. This kind of "quitting" is upright and aboveboard. On the contrary, if you glossed over it at the time, then he may really think that you stole money, and soon he may dismiss you. Even if he doesn't dismiss you, the charge of being a thief is confirmed. For the former reason, your parents and friends will at most criticize you for being bad-tempered. But if you are dismissed for the latter reason, your reputation will not be good, it will be difficult to convince people with explanations, and your credibility will suffer a great loss. Therefore, when the manager unreasonably oppresses you, you should immediately protest. However, in today's society, although bosses cannot overwhelm you with "reason," they can subdue you with "unemployment," so they dare to disregard reason and oppress you at will. The method I mentioned above is only aimed at maintaining personal integrity and coping with the daily environment. If we say that apprentices can truly achieve liberation from their demands, then we must throw ourselves into the broad masses to demand a comprehensive social movement. Only in this movement can your life and freedom be thoroughly rescued. Therefore, your efforts should be divided into two aspects: on the one hand, you need to defend against the boss's unreasonable oppression, and on the other hand, you need to strive for your own active liberation.</p>

<p>— by Ivan Vazov of Bulgaria, translated by Yang Sen</p>
<p>That autumn, a strange fog descended on the city of Vetrino. The weather was humid and cold, with a continuous drizzle. It seemed that the entire sky was melting into ice water and pouring down on the low roofs of the city. In the dark, muddy streets, there was always a noisy sound. Carts pulled by thin horses, oxcarts piled with countless military supplies, farmers leading their horses and livestock, all filled the streets. Amidst this chaos, a column of new recruits advanced noisily, some wearing military uniforms, some with only sheepskin coats turned fur-side out, and most wrapped in tattered blankets, using their eyes as waterproof cloths. They wore belts around their chests, guns on their shoulders, decorated with a bunch of boxwood, and carried overloaded food bags. These kind young men were almost frozen solid. The mud soaked their knees, and the rain and snow lashed their faces, but they still sang along the way.</p>
<p>At the entrance of a tavern, a group of officers, travelers, and farmers stood, curiously watching these heroes in the mud.</p>
<p>In the town square, a group of women, daughters, and children gathered, poorly dressed and shivering. Frozen numb. They were waiting for the soldiers from Vetrino, who were advancing from Harmanli with their joint troops to Sofia, and then being transported to the front line.</p>
<p>"Ah, George's son is there! Bless you, Cvetko!"</p>
<p>"I saw him… Languel just passed by."</p>
<p>"That's Nedelkin! John, your mother is here!"</p>
<p>"Flowers were quickly passed over, tears flowed down many people's cheeks, words half swallowed in their stomachs... The military band is coming, in fact, it has already passed."</p>
<p>"Mommy," a red-cheeked little daughter shouted, "Big brother is here!"</p>
<p>"Stoyan, brother!" This time it was a seven-year-old child shouting: he was next to the daughter, and his arm pointed to the soldiers.</p>
<p>"My son, my son!" The mother groaned sadly.</p>
<p>A tall, handsome young man with dark eyes temporarily left the column, kissed his mother's hand, and kissed the foreheads of his younger sister and brother. He wore a bouquet of flowers given to him by a girl on his chest, and another bouquet of flowers was tied to his ear. Then he rejoined the ranks and marched forward together.</p>

<h3 id="e304">Some Deviations Regarding Rural Films <a href="#e304" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c304" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">304</a></h3>
<p>— Mai Lang</p>
<p>Thoughts After Watching "As the Earth Turns"</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the attitudes of film writers in dealing with rural themes, I have long had some opinions that I wanted to express. After watching Alfred Green's masterpiece "As the Earth Turns," this impulse has been rekindled.</p>
<p>Chinese and foreign rural film writers seem to have a common, simple concept: they view the countryside as an ideal paradise that exists in contrast to the vulgar city. In the countryside they depict, there are strong rural customs, lush flowers and trees, simple villagers, and pure love. In other words, they idealize the already dilapidated countryside into a beautiful escape for people squeezed out of the city, like a utopia. The city is dirty and sinful, so we should return to the pure and tranquil countryside. This is true of "City Lights," "Modern Times," and others.</p>
<p>Many people have already pointed out that the present countryside is no longer a paradise. However, the illusion of viewing the countryside as pure as a heaven, in opposition to the "sinful city," still strongly remains in the minds of many playwrights and film critics. We know that modern metropolises are not products of rational and healthy societies. The current industrial and economic systems, like magnets attracting iron filings, absorb the majority of the population into deformed cities. In modern times, cities are centers of commerce and industry, and hubs of transportation and culture. In other words, cities are places where the labor of the majority is needed for the enjoyment of a few. They absorb the rural population, turning the entire social structure into a deformed image with an inflated abdomen and withered limbs. However, in this inflated city, there are no plans to improve the living conditions of each other. As a result, because the majority of people are concentrated in densely populated areas, they form a place for fierce survival competition. Unemployment, starvation, suffering, disease, difficulty in getting married, moral decay, fights, and killings... This creates a dark side of the city like a human hell. Therefore, to be clear, sin and simplicity, darkness and light, are by no means inherent characteristics of cities and the countryside, but only temporary pathological phenomena caused by a social system. The cause of sin lies not in the city itself, but in the social system that opposes the city and the countryside. Similarly, the way to eliminate all these sins and darkness is not to "return to the countryside," but to eliminate the root cause that opposes these two. The original author of "As the Earth Turns" wrote the city and the countryside as two extremes representing evil and good (writing Jen's tranquility and purity, and Doris's frivolity and licentiousness, are all representations of the author's concept of the city and the countryside), and used the idyllic brushstrokes of a pastoral painting to depict the simple people's attachment to the land. This only shows that the author cannot deeply see the root cause of the opposition between the current society and the countryside, but simply dissatisfied with the irrationality and darkness of the city, and reactively reveals the yearning for the idealized countryside. Without a clear perspective on tomorrow, poets often seek comfort from yesterday. From fantasy to science, from empty illusions to real change, this stage of understanding must be crossed when dealing with rural themes.</p>
<p>The change of the social system, and the dispersion of the population caused by this change, are the fundamental ways to eliminate the opposition between the countryside and the city. Focus on reality! Hasn't there already been one-sixth of the world as an example?</p>

<h3 id="e305">Review of "Sacrifice for Whom" <a href="#e305" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c305" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">305</a></h3>
<p>— Central Film, Ling He</p>
<p>Although in this script, the playwright included many technical flaws and even incorrect tendencies, in the present circumstances where it is not allowed to talk about resisting Japan, and in the present circumstances where trains and mail are open, and even the so-called economic reciprocity, we can see this film that reflects the heroic battles of the volunteer army to some extent, in any case, it is worth getting excited about. Therefore, it can further prove that our national spirit has not declined. Given an opportunity, the suppressed resentment will always erupt. Who says that film practitioners are just living in a muddle-headed way and will not awaken to fight for national interests? The small company, which has never paid much attention to the content of films, is now bravely shouldering its mission, isn't it?</p>
<p>But the playwright did not grasp the serious theme. Although he wrote about the battles of the volunteer army at the beginning and the end, because he wanted the audience to sympathize with the female spy, and made her sacrifice for love, the atmosphere of love-supremacism was very strong, and it confused the theme of the play. This loss is not small, right?</p>
<p>Regarding this point, on the one hand, we understand that the playwright had to replace the weight of resisting Japan with love in an environment where anti-imperialism was not allowed. On the other hand, in terms of creative techniques, it was completely unnecessary to make the spy sympathize with the audience. If we follow the progress of the story, that's right, we admit that a woman who lacks understanding can act as a spy for the enemy under certain circumstances, and at the same time, when she realizes it, when she knows her responsibilities, she can immediately turn to the right side. But the playwright did not pay attention to this point. He wrote her as a love-supremacist. Her transformation was only for love. This unrealistic character is the playwright's vulgarity. Then, according to this, the female spy will never realize it, so why not simply write her as a completely bad woman? So the transformation later is not needed at all.</p>
<p>So this woman is simply an irrelevant and unrealistic character. In addition, the director's skills are not very good, and Huang Manli cannot play this type of individualistic villain, which leads to the failure of the entire play. He, on the one hand, said that the screenwriter wanted the plot to be tortuous, so that Staff Wang was suddenly released from prison, and even the female spy's confession. That method is also very bad. Because even if the plot is tortuous, it must be reasonable.</p>
<p>No, these are the director's greatest responsibilities. If the director can truly take on his task, then the director must be responsible to the audience for the considerably problematic script and make it 100% excellent. The director's skills are obviously not as good as the screenwriter's skills. As we see it, apart from Zhang Yi's role being relatively realistic, the rest of the people are made to be irrelevant and unrealistic. Those roles are not inherently talented in acting, but the main thing is that the director does not understand how to develop the personality of the actors. For example, Chen Yan has always played negative roles, but here she makes her laugh when she shouldn't laugh and can't cry when she wants to cry. Huang Manli has always been a timid type, which can be fully proved in "Homecoming," but here she is asked to be a seductive femme fatale, resulting in a bitter smile on a soulless character. In addition, the director does not know the tension of the plot and does not understand the importance of tone in the play. As a result, the alertness or agility that a spy should have cannot be found on Huang Manli. He, like the director's own disguise as Captain Lu, is not very good. Only Zhang Yi is slightly better. In addition, in some places, such as inserting a medium shot in the middle of a long shot, it cannot be connected well, and the climax cannot be grasped, etc. The gimmicks are also very stiff. Other things are omitted.</p>
<h3 id="e306">American Advertising Industry Selects Best Film Advertisement <a href="#e306" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c306" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">306</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Xiong</p>
<p>In my ordinary person's eyes, film advertisements are the most prone to exaggeration and therefore the most untrustworthy. Unexpectedly, this time they have gained an unexpected harvest in the American advertising industry. This can also be regarded as a ray of dawn in our dark film circle. (Or perhaps their film circle is not as dark as China's. Editor's note)</p>
<p>Advertising was included as one of the Literary Excellence Awards, starting with the American Spectator magazine. The magazine presents a total of six Literary Excellence Awards each year: feature writing, satire, novel, essay, drama, and advertising. The editors of the magazine are all contemporary American writers, such as American playwright O'Neill and novelist Anderson, etc.</p>
<p>This spring, the editors of the newspaper evaluated the merits of advertisements from the cigarette, automobile, clothing, publishing, and stage play industries across the United States over the past year. As a result, film advertisements were selected as the best, and "Palooka" (Palooka, which will be shown at the Southern Theater soon) was specifically cited as a representative work in film advertisements. The film stars Jimmy Durante, Lupe Velez, and Stuart Erwin, and is a comedy.</p>
<p>The "Palooka" advertisement focuses entirely on the male lead, Jimmy Durante, with terms such as "a newly discovered beauty on the screen" and "the most musically gifted piano master of modern times." In addition, the advertisement specifically hired the first-class American cartoonist Segar to satirically depict how the male lead is a "beauty" and a "piano master," etc., so that readers are interested and must see the "beauty" and "piano master," which is the effectiveness of the film's advertisement.</p>
<p>After the news that the film's advertisement was selected as the best was announced, five newspaper editors also admitted that they were attracted by the advertisement to see the film, and they all expressed satisfaction. When "Palooka" is released in this city, we will definitely have the opportunity to appreciate this best film advertisement.</p>
<h3 id="e307">Mae West's Magic <a href="#e307" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c307" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">307</a></h3>
<p>— Dong Lin</p>
<p>Speaking of Mae West, who is not attracted to her? When you read the following news, you will be even more amazed at her magic!</p>
<p>According to a Boston dispatch from the United States, a major theater there recently caught fire while showing a film. However, more than 600 viewers in the theater did not move from their seats to escape, let alone move their bodies! What is the reason for this? It is said that the theater was showing Mae West's film that day!</p>
<p>I cannot guarantee that this news is true. But if this is true, then Mae West is truly an amazing person!</p>
<h3 id="e308">"Song of the Fishermen" and Dentsu Company <a href="#e308" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c308" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">308</a></h3>
<p>— Hui</p>
<p>In "Song of the Fishermen," which has been showing for more than a month, the most touching thing is the sad and moving lyrics of the song "Song of the Fishermen," right? But being able to directly and accurately send those lyrics clearly to the ears of the audience must be attributed to the dubbing of Dentsu Company's San-you-shiki recorder. However, Dentsu Company people said that the dubbing of "Song of the Fishermen" was only Dentsu's initial attempt and cannot be regarded as a standard work. Now the company has conducted more in-depth research, and the sound reception is becoming more perfect. In addition to sending a recorder to the Hong Kong Universal Company to work, a film studio is also being set up on Xietu Road in this city, specializing in shooting sound films. The first all-dialogue, singing sound film "Peach and Plum Robbery" is now one-third completed. It will be presented to film fans around the Mid-Autumn Festival. (Rewards)</p>

<h3 id="e309">Twentieth Century Limited (1) <a href="#e309" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c309" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">309</a></h3>
<p>— By Wen Yin</p>
<p>Starring John Barrymore, produced by Columbia Pictures, USA</p>
<p>The Twentieth Century Limited is running every day... Hasty farewells... Final kisses... Sorrowful handshakes... The station is bustling with crowds... A red carpet stretches from the entrance of the station, directly to the side of a chartered carriage. It is laid for feet that do not tread ordinary earth! Human rank differs. When the illusory dream of glory elevates one out of humanity to the lofty heights, everyone reveres them as a deity and demands that they be treated with special consideration. In years past, this red carpet was often laid for Oscar Jaffe. But alas... Oscar Jaffe has had a string of five consecutive failures... And since his utter defeat, all entrances to LaSalle Street Station have been closely guarded by detectives and police, fearing he might sneak out of the country. Because an unthinkable thing has happened: America's greatest theatrical producer has declared bankruptcy and, burdened with debt, is eager to flee. Now appearing on the red carpet, stepping lightly and frequently blowing kisses and waving to the well-wishers, is a certain Lily Garland. The rise of Lily Garland and the tragic fall of Oscar Jaffe are one and the same, inseparable. Six years ago, he discovered her. He worked with her, felt discouraged and disappointed because of her, but she, under his tutelage and encouragement, eventually became a red-hot actress. It was also he who, for three years, loved her with unwavering devotion, but he also quarreled with her from time to time and, driven by unthinking jealousy, drove her to madness, ultimately leading her to break up with him resolutely.</p>
<p>Owen O'Malley is a well-known Broadway newsmaker. There is also Oliver Webb, Jaffe's business manager. They are also at the station. Watching Lily's smug demeanor, they both opened their mouths, speechless. They suddenly recalled that night... When Jaffe and Lily were quarreling, they both opened their mouths, speechless. It was as if he had gone mad, rushing to the street in front of the theater, shouting at the electricians who were putting up Lily's large electric sign: "Get down! Take down the sign for me too!" Gasping for breath, he snatched a brush from a painter's hand. The painter was painting Lily's large name, trying to make it eye-catching. Jaffe dipped the brush full of black paint and furiously smeared out Lily's name on the sign. He erased the names of all the stars on all the signs. He continued to shout madly, "Cancel her name completely!" He shouted and jumped, because he could not help but perform, just as he could not help but breathe. So he shouted to the workers: "Lily Garland is no more! Return to oblivion, Lily Garland! Obscurity! Obliterate her name from the earth!" How quickly the world changes, how things have changed to such a degree! Now Lily Garland walks on the red carpet and boards the train, while Oscar Jaffe? He hides aside, waiting for a chance to sneak into the station, preparing to escape to the destitute Chicago. O'Malley, watching from the side, couldn't help but mutter a curse: "Obscurity!" Only Webb said: "What great prestige! We can use her." O'Malley shook his head and sighed: "Since she left him, Jaffe has failed four times in a row!" Webb quickly corrected him: "Not just four times, five times! I can't help but attribute it to her. When she left Jaffe, she took away all of his talent!" (To be continued)</p>
