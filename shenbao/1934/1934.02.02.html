<h3 id="c32">修改中美商約之關鍵 <a href="#c32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>廷</p>
<p>據一九O三年中美商約第十七欵規定。該約以十年爲期。嗣後每届十年。雙方均可要求修改。本年一月十三日。卽爲第三次簽約滿十年之期。國民政府乃於時前向美國提議。另訂新約。報載。美政府承認我國有要求修改之權。惟對另訂新約一點。則有允諾與拒絕二説·本文姑以修改原約爲立論之對象。</p>
<p>一九O三年之中美商約共計十七欵。包含十項。㈠遣使設官。㈡居住貿易。㈢關税。㈣礦務。㈤商標版權。㈥内港行船。㈦開埠。㈧幣制。㈨傳敎。㈩治外法權。就各欵一般的性質言。除關税一項業經兩國於一九二九年七月二十五日别訂新約外。最稱重要者。爲（甲）居住貿易。（乙）治。</p>
<p>外法權。及（丙）内港行船等三項。而就中美間之特殊關係言。則（甲）（乙）二項。尤爲今後修約談判之關鍵。吾人以爲二項中之居住貿易問題。當以華人入美權及華僑在美權利爲交涉中心。而治外法權則當以實行撤廢爲原則。茲請引申其意如后。</p>
<p>（甲）居住貿易　原約第三欵規定。美國人民准在中國之通商地方。往來居住。辦理各項工商合法事業。并准享一切在華最惠國人民之利益。但在他方面。則並未聲明中國人民有享受移入美國及在美經營事業之同等權利。其所享之最惠國待遇。亦僅限於華貨入美之納税事項。（見第五欵）此爲片惠的不平等辦法。自不待言。雖云根據一八六八年之蒲安臣條約。早有兩國人民互享最惠國待遇之明文。此處似無庸複。而蒲約貌存質亡。業爲世人所公認。不可不辨。按美國取締黄色人種入境。久爲其外交史上之污點。吾人痛心疾首。不自今始。一九O五年我國抵制美貨運動。卽爲該項心理之反映。事前美人知之甚稔。故有退還庚子賠欵一部分以買我好感之舉。今日吾人縱不自國際道義立塲。以唤起美人對移民問題之同情考慮。卽根據條約權利發言。亦可振振有詞。蓋上述之蒲安臣條約。已剴切承認變更居住與變更國籍[爲天賦的與不可割讓的人權。]並承認中美兩國人民。由此國自由遷往彼國。爲有利益之事。兩締約國應不加以禁阻。吾人須知蒲約迄今仍爲中美現存條約之一。且自一九O四年後。中美間亦不復有任何關於中國移民之新條約成立。故美政府不顧條約義務國際信義·迭以本國法令取締華人入境。并苛待留美華僑。實與國際公法之定則背道而馳。我國默認其破壤條約之舉動。乃爲事實問題。絶非法律問題。今爲懲前毖後計。自當乘此修約良機。盡力以確定前約所賦與之權利。萬一爲事實所不許。亦須在不妨害國家及民族尊嚴之原則下。對於現行辦法。加以適當之糾正。至旅美華僑之財産權、營業權、婚姻權等。亦應確保其處於與他國僑民同等之地位。不得因膚色國籍之差異。而屈受歧視。想蒲安臣條約旣有互惠的最惠國待遇之規定。在正式談判之會議席上。美方或不敢横加推翻。滿案發生後。日美邦交。驟趨緊張，美國有旘人士。多覺有修改現行東方人種人境法令之必要。用以緩和日本仇美之空氣。卽素稱排斥東方人種最激烈之加里福尼亞省。其領袖人物如舊金山商會會長及加省大學校長等。亦公然抨擊現行制度。而主張在額定限制之下。每年容納中日等國之移民若干人入境。其猶持反對諭調者。不過一部分之工會中人。殊不足以左右全美與論。故在今日進行移民談判。實與我方有利。良機難得。幸勿失之交臂。（乙）治外法權　治外法權制度。本爲矯揉造作之産物。種種缺憾。早經中外學者指摘靡遺。可勿贅述。一九O三年中美商約第十五欵云。[中國政府。深欲整頓本國律例。以期與各西國律例改同一律。美國允願盡力恊助。以成此舉。一俟查悉中國律例情形及其審斷辦法。並一切相關事宜。皆臻妥善。美國卽允棄其治外法權。]可見美國亦承認該項畸形制度爲暫時權宜辦法。一九二九年四月。國民政府外交部長王正廷。照會英美法荷挪威巴西六國。要求對於撤廢治外法權之舉動。予以同情之考慮。美國覆牒。雖直言中國司法未能完全獨立。但仍一願參加談判。以便設法逐漸放棄其領事裁判權。（卽治外法權）或在指定之區域内。或於專定法權之種類。或兩者並舉。]其後國民政府。以與各國交涉迄無具體辦法。乃於一九二九年十二月二十八日。自行宣布治外法權之廢止。此舉固在我國權力範圍之内。但事實證明。如欲外人降以就我。非有運用最後手段之實力不可。故在今日環境之下。吾人可採之途徑。惟有自修改條約着手。日本卽用此法。而得實現其恢復法權之夙願。我國可以傚法。介修約交涉。又有與對手方聯合交涉或單獨交涉之别。往時我國與各大關係國談判治外法權問題。大抵採取聯合交涉之方針。結果未見良好。今後似可改絃更張。從事單獨談判。以分散各國之團結。使其無互相推諉觀望之餘地。當年日本大隈重信之修約政策。卽由此方式入手。而卒造成青木周藏氏之最後勝利。國民政府决於中美修改商約之會。舊事重提。求一撤廢治外法權之雙方滿意辦法。殆卽抱有「各個擊破」之願望者也。至美方前提分區或按事漸進之撤廢計劃。我國一部分學者已表同情。吾人亦覺將來所採之對策。於其貽欲速不達之誚。毌寗格外愼重。以免爲他日同樣交涉之阴礙。修約談判。以政府當折衝之責。固不待論。但近代外交。非藉强有力之民意爲鞭策。必不足以發揮其機能。我國人對此行將開幕之中美修約交涉。其速有所表示。以爲政府之後盾。</p>

<p>日本海軍當局表示</p>
<p>决心打破海軍比率</p>
<p>認此率制非永久不變</p>
<p>日本海軍有充實必要</p>
<p>（東京）一九三五年之海軍縮會議、已迫在眉睫、現近開會中之日本議會連日討論本問題、並質問政府日本有無提出强固具體案之凖備、而其所主張者、一致非難現行比率所規定海軍勢力之不合理、海軍當局鑒於與論之趨勢、遂决意將於一九三五年海軍軍縮會議、斷然反對依照比率主義改正之海軍條約、其理由可分爲三、</p>
<p>㈠以比率爲軍縮之尺度一事、由美國前國務卿休士在華盛頓會議、爲保持於自國有利之海軍勢力起見、而發明之辦法、並無久遠的妥當性、</p>
<p>㈡所謂比率者、係指分量之比率、並實質之比率、因此美國計劃倫敦條約所許容之大建艦、則日本亦不得不投數萬萬元經費、實行第二次補充計劃、而軍縮所以爲目的之减輕國民負但一項、卒成爲有名無實者、且戰爭之脅威倍加、如日法應等被迫惟將最低比率之國家、殆不能期望國防之安全、</p>
<p>㈢於是乎茲有實施軍縮新尺度之必要、意以維持日本海軍會於華盛頓及倫敦會議再决主張之[充分於防守而不充分於攻擊]的海軍力爲目標、亽最低保有量之範圍内、承認其融通性、並容許各國保有自國最以爲適當之軍艦、然則軍縮之崇高目的始可達成、（一日日聯社電）</p>

<p>歐洲取捨在兩道</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國關於軍縮之備忘錄已於今晚發表、中有要言日、[吾人必須就能解决之處以求解决之道]、備忘錄分爲兩部分、第一部分說明發表今次備忘錄之理由、略謂若無新指導的建議、則日内瓦談判之重開、終將陷於更失望之境、自去年三月以來之討論、已證明英國之草約須予修正　不許某某數國置備之武器、世界他國亦不得置備一節、此種辦法、在今日顯已不可能、英政府以爲旣准此一國置備之武器、决不能無限期的不許彼國置備、歐洲今必於下列兩道擇一而行、卽㈠商妥軍備最雄厚之强國廢棄某某類武器之公約、㈡就此類强國同意於不增加目前軍備之基礎商訂條約、英政府則切欲積極進行第一道、</p>
<p>三項總目</p>
<p>安全平等軍縮</p>
<p>公約有效期十年第二部分陳述英政府認爲可因以獲得妥恊之途徑、謂必須在三項總目之下作適當之規定、㈠安全、㈡權利平等、㈢軍縮、備忘錄於安全一項主張、於英國之草約外再加三欵、切實規定簽約國對防杜或補救違背公約之責任、此層與德總理締給不侵犯之建議、可臻各國一律接受之安全、而權利平等原則之實行、英政府認其重要亦不亞於安全之總則、至於軍縮一項、備忘錄謂軍備雄厚之强國或不願放棄現有之軍備、而德總理已自願放棄侵略武器矣、此類軍備雄厚之强國、苟作積極之貢獻、則必能使各國軍備等次一律下降也、備忘錄至是乃臚列軍縮建議、以爲可依此訂定有效期限十年之條約、</p>

<p>英政府且凖備承認將八個月之軍役期限改爲十二個月、在議定的數字上標凖化之步驟、應於四年内告成之、軍隊外之軍事訓練應予禁止、禁例當由永設與自動的監察機關查之、</p>
<p>砲與坦克</p>
<p>德國得以置備</p>
<p>奥匈保與德相等以言武器、凡永久的邊界與砲台防務之砲位最大口徑應由國際條約規定之、坦克車重量在三十噸以上者應在第一年年底銷燬、二十噸以上者在第三年年底銷毁、十六噸以上者在第五年年底銷毁、英政府贊同德國短役新軍置備坦克車、以重六噸者爲限、爲求早臻妥恊起見、英政府凖備贊成德國短役新軍備置一五五米里米達之砲、三五O米里米達口徑以上之砲應在第一年年底銷毁、二二O以上者應在第四年年底銷毁、一五五以上者應在第七年年底銷毁、英政府凖備應允奥·匈·保·三國置備相等之砲隊與坦克車、</p>

<p>德享漸進平等權利</p>

<p>讀書指導（續）</p>
<p>雖然如此、我覺常常不自量的去開導人，勸人不要把光陰用在這些消磨意志的廢物上。但是，因爲我缺乏批評的學力，我總不能說服他們。一本畇較艱深的書，譬如屠塲罷！我曾經向圖書館借到了。熱心的打開來讀，我覺得非常艱深，句字太長，不合我以前看書的習慣，地名人名都是那麽生，呌我不得不减低許多趣味。雖然，得了「小開」許多帮助，减去了一些疑難，但是像這樣辛勞的去讀一册小說，實在未免太費事了。我只有一人感着「苦笑」。自然，這不是目前困難，這困難早被我克服了。</p>
<p>不過，我仍缺乏克服别人困難的能力。但我從經騐中，體會他們是被一種低級趣味所遮蔽了。他們仍舊可以克服，仍舊可以復見光明；並且他們亦急急需要光明。</p>
<p>可是打倒低級趣味首先就有高級趣味去代替才行。「高級」而要有「趣味」就是如何去克服目前的「高級」的「艱深」呢？要使人們被說服，你就得對那些「野草」去掘根，不要以爲火燒過了的草原，逢春不會再發生的。關於這一點，就得對新舊鴛鴦蝴蝶之流的毒物再下一番通俗批評的工夫啊！</p>
<p>先生，話說得太無倫次了。總括起來，不過是一句：如何提高一般的趣味。雖然，這工程就祇有你們配做，目下應做。也只有這點做到了，你們的工作方不是替少數人服務。小店員學徒方才受到你們之賜。</p>
<p>要解放的是廣大學徒和店員的趣味，我雖然有了半知半解，但只是覺得，不知如何做法。以上的意見整個是我的，但文是「小開」替我草出，因爲我恐怕書不盡意，不能使你們澈底了解，不是怕文字不通，自己丢臉。</p>
<p>最後，敬煩不吝詳細指改</p>

<p>敎部督學戴夏兩次之演講紀要</p>
<p>敎部督學戴夏視察浙江省敎育歸來、上星期在中央廣播無綫台演講、本星期一在敎部紀念週中報告、兩次演講情形、略有不同、昨承將兩次演講要點酌示、茲錄于下、</p>
<p>（一）關于敎育行政方面</p>
<p>該省各級敎育行政機關之組織、大致健全、法令之推行、尙算認眞、各項章則以及行政方針計劃等、亦多切實可行、其中以輔導會議及敎育局長下鄕巡視兩種制度、尤有精彩、足資吾人之參考、輔導會議之宗旨、係爲促進初等敎育與社會敎育而設、其組織分四級、卽省省學區、（大致依舊府區分爲十一學區）縣市縣市學區是也、有輔導會議由敎育廳主持、爲發動機關、省學區輔導會議、分别省立中學附屬小學以及省或代用社敎輔導機關主持、縣市輔導會議、由縣市敎育局主持、均屬承接樞紐、其基本組織、乃縣市學區輔導會議、由中心小學及縣立民衆敎育館或縣立中心民衆學校主持以討論關于初等敎育及社會敎育各種實際問題、此制之推行、已歷四載、工作尙較緊張、初敎及社敎之效率因之增進不鮮、其次爲敎育局長鄕巡之制、現定各縣市敎育局長于每一學期中、應有四星期之時間下鄕巡視、其任務爲抽查並整飭各敎育機關之工作、考查各鄕區敎育經費狀况、注意各敎育機關與民衆聯絡狀况、必要時召集鄕鎭長及其他有關人士舉行關於督促增設學校與充實學額之談話會、或訪問熱心敎育或公益之士紳、交換改進敎育起見、此制甫經公布、實施未久、但將來定可獲有美滿之成績、</p>
<p>（二）關于敎育經費方面</p>
<p>該省省敎育經費之數量、在民國二十年度、經臨合計爲二百八十三萬餘元、二十一年度、厲行緊縮、僅支二百二十四萬餘元、本年度更縮减爲二百一十萬六千四百三十六元、經費數額旣不甚充裕、又逐年遞减、其竭蹶情形顯而易見、而該省各種敎育、能在此經濟狀態極度緊縮之下、非惟維持原有狀態、且在質量上均得有合理之進展、可謂難能可貴、雖然各項設施、因經費之支絀未能儘量發展、亦事實之所難免也、</p>
<p>歷年以來該省財政雖極艱窘、對于敎欵尙能儘先撥發、但敎育獨立一事、近來迭經敎育部嚴令督促、而該省當局亦感敎費穩固之必要、于是訂定辦法分期實現、其大要爲指定箔類營業稅每年一百二十萬元、菸酒附稅每年約二十萬元、屠宰營業稅每年約六十萬元、三項共約二百萬元、作爲省敎育經費專欵、分三期實行、自明年五月份起、可完全獨立、敎費獨立問題、至此告一段落、</p>
<p>地方敎育經費之來源、頗爲複雜、其要有四成敎育費、上下期田賦附捐、畝榖捐、屠宰稅、置產騐契捐、土產捐、商業助捐、迷信捐、消耗捐、奢侈捐、以及他項雜捐等、其總數量、合計爲三百萬零七千二百五十一元、各縣中敎費之支出、最多者爲二十八萬四千一百十三元、最少者爲五千六百四十九元、各縣敎育經育經費除少數縣份外、原極支絀、况一般的多因受農村經濟衰落之影響收入减少、而大多數縣份、歷年積欠過鉅、整理倍覺困難、現敎育廳亟籌補救、對於開源方面、業已呈准政府于嗣後新增各項地方捐稅内提撥百分之二十、以充地方敎育經費、將來可望有多量之挹注、至於整理方面、亦曾詳訂辦法、督令進行、惟目前尙未能多得實效、仍須加意精進、</p>
<p>（三）關于高等敎育方面</p>
<p>該省設施高等敎育機關、除國立私立諸校外、省立者僅有醫藥專科學校一校、該校秉有悠久之歷史、辦理尙切實際、畢業生出路亦佳、惟近年因經費支絀之故、醫療及科學設備、未能盡臻完善、（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c202">不自由的結婚 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>結婚，現在說起來，當然要崇尙自由；因爲人的一生，一夫一婦，是個單位，有了美滿的家庭，然後纔有健全的社會，有了健全的社會，然後纔有强固的國家；那末，婚姻，所以必定大家求到自由兩字的道理，就是對於終身而有無缺之獨立主權，也就是對於百年而享完全之平等幸福；倘若不是這樣，　然締了這婚約，或者自己沒有同意，從小聽父母和門第的關係，到了後來，責備攀親的不良，以至雙方駡爺駡娘，這實在是婚姻不自由的惡果，不論那一個道學家，終無可否認啊！</p>
<p>咦！其實說是這樣，而不曉得在眞正結婚的那一天，你看他兩個新郎新娘的地位，有沒有自由的資格，恐怕不想，也要恍然大悟的要失笑哩！因爲什麽？别的不講，單就結婚的當兒，你要自由，簡直是像做了犯人一般，寸步不得自由行動，新郎須要男嬪相去請出，而新娘坐在車中和坐在轎子裹，更加須得要女嬪相去攙扶，方敢起身開步，不！只得呆呆的悶坐在裹頭，聲息不能響，失却自由，可算極端；而一般時髦的人們還說著「自由結婚，」終羨慕得萬分，以爲自由，就在這個時候；唉！其實眞錯認了，你！不看見司儀的立在高高的櫈上，他手中還拿著猩紅的一張禮節單，他倘若口裹不肯高聲喊著誰也不敢動，所以這一位司儀的，在那時候，操著禮堂上全塲的無上權威，他喊奏樂，會得鼓樂喧天的吹打起來，他喊著那一個入席，會得來賓和介紹人，以及主婚同證婚的，也就挨次走進，而新郎新婦，竟會得眼睛看了鼻頭，在觀禮衆目暌暌之下，徐徐的被男女嬪相牽了到同一立塲上，笑也不敢，頭也不抬，聽人家喊著這樣，就依做這樣，你看這時，結婚，還有一些自由在那裹麽？司儀不喊着退，沒有一個敢退，就是證婚人，必定是個老成碩望的一位長者，年歲當然不會小，也要依從司儀的口號，否則，也呆呆的立著，止少要站半小時，就是脚冷腿酸，老是不敢自行離開，故别人說「自由結婚」，我偏要翻轉來說，這呌「不自由的結婚」　　從前舊式的禮節，確是不大好，然而現在也覺得有許多無謂的煩文，像交換飾物和用印等等，不過是個形式罷了；而證婚人從表面看，像替他倆一對新夫婦，作個担保，那末，是何等的重要，所以照例說幾句很好的訓辭，「將來什麽組織一個新的家庭，爲社會的良模範，」噲！不幸不到幾時，他俩提出離婚的條件，證婚人偏沒有干係，法律上不會去傳著訊問他，你當時是怎作證的：哈哈！那末，其他，豈不是通通多的麽？</p>
<h3 id="c203">冬之晨 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 傅翼之</p>
<p>北風呼呼地迎面撲來，撲向我的領間，袖子，衣义裹，曲折地鑽進</p>
<p>我的内身，不禁使我連打幾個寒噤；小商店門口的鉛皮橫招，給風吹得搖擺不定，有時，還發出括辣括辣的悲鳴；馬路上很少行人，黃包車夫招不着主顧，瑟縮地拖着空車踱向茫茫的生活之途前進；男的戴着破呢帽，女的裹着花布巾，挑着韭，芹，蘿蔔之類的菜販，一擔一擔的送進小菜塲以候娘姨小姐們的光臨；···這里，沒有構成都市繁華的基本人員，這時，更聽不到點綴熱閙的喊呌與歌聲，像大戰前夜的邊塞和古城，只有爲生存而鬥爭的土卒們拚命地在趕築戰壕，迎待他們的敵人。呵！這就是都會的冬天的早晨。</p>
<p>在滿佈店旁，住宅，和一切動靜物的大都會裹生活着的人們，早就不知有所謂使人陶醉的，美化的大自然了，生機活潑的春和富有藝術意味的秋，只有在大自然的懷抱裹纔可以領會到，纔可以欣賞它創造出的美的，詩的藝術口｜｜景物；而炎威逼人的夏與寒氣澈骨的冬，雖在大都會裹，也和荒村茅屋中同樣感受得到，而且，有時特别使人難耐；尤其是這樣的一個冬之晨；除非室内裝有熱氣管，室外備有雪佛蘭的人們纔會一無感覺；誰說繁華的都市是人間的天堂呢？</p>
<p>這時，風，似乎是戰勝了一切，是最得意的時候了。光芒四射的朝陽，常可給窮人們以許多的暖意，增加人們的體温，而風則常懷嫉妬，偏不許它「市恩」；當朝陽圑圑地上升，漸漸地向人間輸送一點暖意的時候，它却一陣陣地咆哮着，使朝陽只在薄薄的雲霧裹呈現一個淡淡的陰影。它不肯留它有餘的威勢，儘管向人間施用它所有殘暴的本能。這樣一個嚴肅的，凄切的早晨，大槪就是它所造成的罪惡的結晶吧！</p>

<p>— 戴欲仁</p>
<p>嘗聞西友言，與其旅行扶桑三島，不如遊鑒覽揚子江風景，蓋長江風景天然，又多古跡，且江輪設備舒適，又無海行風浪之苦。余近因事至漢口，留五日，事畢後，得一日暇，乃偕友渡江至武昌，復僱汽車行十五里至珞珈山，參觀武漢大學，校舍依山而築，壯麗無匹，東傍東湖，有類杭州之西湖，而淸淨過之。對岸有花園及養蜂塲，爲某銀行家所辦，此處空氣新鮮，風景佚麗，地又僻靜，修學於此，至爲相宜。予流連久之，復返武昌，登黃鶴樓，眺望漢陽漢口，歷歷在目，誦昔人黃鶴樓詩至「晴川歷歷漢陽樹」句，乃亟渡江至漢陽，尋睛川閣，已破舊不堪登臨矣。就欲有所遊覽，惜時已傍晚，江安輪汽笛已鳴，乃卽回至漢口登輪，九時起椗，夜午至黃州，昔蘇東坡遊赤璧處也。次日抵九江，遙見廬山高聳，積雪未消，可見山中氣候之寒冷，尤能想見暑天陰凉爽適，誠避暑之勝地也。並購得磁器數種，精緻古雅，非若舶來品之洋氣十足，惜近年國人喜用洋貨，以致江西磁業不振，深為可惜。下午舟經彭澤，城墻依幾峰修筑依市傍江在船中丁　　　見　此三面環山，一面監江之小城頗類世外桃源。昔陶淵明曾會官於此飲酒賦詩，尚復何求乎桃花源哉又行數小時，通小孤山，屹立江心，秀麗無比，翌日祇大通，由此可乘小船至九華山，（我國四大名山之一）每年夏季，朝山士女為熟關。復下行過鎮江，見焦山峙立江中，與小孤山相若而大，亦為沿江古勝之一，以無時間遊覽為憾。自漢口至上海，為揚子江下游，再上至四川等處，即為上游，則水流湍急，不若下游之易于行舟也。沿路風帆如林，山島甚多，至足怡目賞心，各處古跡，尤能追憶古人西友之言信矣。且江輸膳食精美，招待周到，行旅至便，惜國人多喜乘坐外輪㠌原因為華輪時有供兵差之事發生。余此次乘江安來申，覺一切食用均較外輪為便利故敢為介紹，亦提倡國營事業之意也。</p>

<p>第二十三回創痛難堪疑神聽鼓樂歡清未洽促別到飛符</p>
<p>因之在這天晚上到後院來的時候，卻故意大寬轉的統了一個彎子，由廂房邊抄到正房窗戶下，將指頭濕著口水，戳了一個窟窿向里面望著。只見姑爺和衣睡在床上，自己姑娘坐在床沿上。然而他雖是坐在床沿上的，卻是扭轉身體支，伏著在床頭邊，看那樣子，好像是在和姑爺說話。那話自然是很長，許久許久沒有說完。江氏雖是老年人，也不由得紅了臉，只索自己直開了。回得家去，一個人心里想著，他兩口子的感情，確是不錯，但是這樣的甜蜜，有公公在堂，未免不像樣子。無論如何，明日白天得把姑娘呌回來，好好的教訓他幾句。想定了，次日上午，趁著桂枝到堂屋里來吃飯的時候：就沖到后面院子里來。進門之後，倒讓他大吃了驚，原來趙自強，不但還是理想中那樣的人，在那里高興著。而且是愁容滿面，手上拜捧了一張紙增在堂屋中間，竟是出了神，岳母進來了，他也不曾看見。江氏笑道：姑爺，你瞧什么啦；瞧得那樣有味。趙自強一抬頭，好像很吃驚的神氣，立刻把那張紙向衣袋里一插。這般一來，江氏就更為疑心了，又追著問道：姑爺你瞧啦。自強苦笑著道：是一封電報。江氏道：那里來的電報？自強猶豫了一會子微笑著，用極低的聲音答道：是我們營長來的電報。呌我趕快回防呢。江氏道：你不是請了兩個禮𢪙的假嗎？自強道：照著日子算，也就到了時候了，路上耽擱幾天，又先到家幾天，不就夠了兩個禮拜了嗎？但是我也算著日子不大夠，原來是請的三個星期呢。我不明白營長為什么不到限期就打電報　來催我。（二三六）</p>
<p>小食譜</p>
<h3 id="c207">廢歷年尾時家常食品 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 朱𦐂</p>
<p>風呼呼，雪霏霏，又是一派急景凋年的歲暮景象。國歷雖已提倡了二十三年，然而國歷新年，在民間不過像外國冬至的埾誕節一般，同樣的不起變化。臘　喧喧，爆竹聲聲，當然是歷年中熱鬧的點綴。中國人的保守性。原是得天獨厚的，何況這歲除伏臘，還是歷代祖先傳之後世的呢！</p>
<p>廢歷年尾，最著重的事情，食，當然是一件重要的事兒。花花綠綠的茶食鋪裹。每家人家，到了年底，也要預備若干過年食品，以供放懷大嚼。</p>
<p>大塊的肉，整段的魚，固然是每家必備的食物。還有幾種比較精美一些的食物，在蘇州人家，也是每家必備的。現在寫在下面，做一下應時的食譜</p>
<p>煎魚</p>
<p>到了年底，菜肴上的盆碟，是不可或缺的東西。煎魚雖係�上出售的普通菜肴，但總比了自煮的來的價值昂貴。所以蘇州人到了年底，大都看書煮燒，煮法也很簡便。先將青魚或大的渭魚洗凈切做三四分厚的薄片，沒在蔥，姜，酒，糖，和醬油混合的液體裹，浸一天或半天，然後取出鋪在扁（竹制品）裹略略陰乾，再燒蓎大油鍋，，將魚片在𣺓油中煎熬，在魚肉半熟的當兒，取出來重行浸入酒和醬油的液裹，再重行入鍋煮燒，以煮熟為度。有的人要魚肉透著香味起見，魚肉煮熟後，在放著香料的木屑上再薰一回，即成，煮魚用青魚，味兒比渭魚肥腴可口</p>
<p>蝦圓</p>
<p>那是暖鍋中不可少的食品。製法：先將蝦出了蝦仁，然後在小石春中將蝦仁和蔥頭豬油一同搗爛，等到蝦仁搗得像泥一般時，然後將雞蛋黃加入同搗。（雞蛋黃視蝦仁多寡而定，大約蝦仁半斤，加蛋黃三個。）俟混和後，略加食鹽，然後煮著滿鍋𣺓水，將搗和的蝦仁，做成桂圓般的圓子，放在水內。那蝦圓一熟，自然會氽上水面，就可撈起來了。做蝦圓有一件注意的事，𣺓水放入生蝦圓時，需用文火慢慢煮燒，否則製成的蝦圓，就肉老而不鮮嫩了。</p>
<p>魚圓</p>
<p>魚圓的製法，與蝦圓仿佛，不過在出魚脯的當兒，須略用一些手續，才能除出細骨。那出魚脯的方法，先將一　魚剖開，然後用刀堅著在魚肉上平刮，那魚肉就變得泥醬一般，附黏在刀上，魚的細骨，自然也逐漸露出，須一一揀去，然後用那種魚醬，入臼搗爛，加入雞蛋。蝦圓中混入的雞蛋，是用蛋黃，魚圓卻要蛋白，魚圓製成之後，就變成顆顆雪白的粉圓了。歲尾的菜肴，除了上述三種，還有蛋餃，（蛋皮裹肉，做成餃子形態。）糟雞，等等，那嚼之無味的筍乾，更是年尾菜肴中不可或缺的東西。蘇州有句俗語，呌做：一年無成，先撣灰塵，一事未乾，先買筍乾。也可見筍乾的重要了。</p>
<p>現在要講到年尾時的點心了。平常人家在年底置備的點心，除在市上購買的黃白糕，各色豬油糕，（豬油糕，共有玫瑰，薄荷，白糖，棗泥等幾種，茶食店中的，比糕　店中的，價雖昂貴些，其味也比較甜而多油。）饅頭，寧波年糕之類，自己製的，也有幾種。</p>

<p>糧食遠期粉午後有多頭活動</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份大致呈平疲盤旋之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥跌二三角左右、故初開後、市氣雖見平穩、旋以廠家略出本月份、人心見疲、遠期亦因買戶無力、趨勢平平、迨至下午開盤、本月份盤旋之中、微轉好面、因廠家未動、買戶吸收、遠期亦因業外多頭活動、均呈穩俏至實銷方面、仍少發展、祇聞掮客吃進兵船粉一萬包、價二元二角、是否津帮收去、尙未確實結果本月份及三月份未動、四月份反較好七厘半、五月份好五厘、六月份好一分、七月份初開二元一角三分二厘半、收價亦好一分云、</p>
<p>七月期新麥改依新量器</p>
<p>較舊器爲小···價打八二折</p>
<p>昨期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份依然沉寂、交易稀少、惟近期傳某廠有收買之意、開價良好、如三月份上下午均開至四元一角二分、較週初提起七分、其餘則無做開、七月份新麥、上下午做開頗暢、惟該行已實行新量器據傳五百担改爲六百担、合一車單位、至價格因新量器較舊量器爲小、大致在八二折左右、（該所尙未確定公布）故呌價遂亦低落、開價爲三元一角二分、旋卽小三元零八分、收價爲三元一角、此種新量器、尙屬初見、業内外方面、須加注意云、現貨因福新及行囤辦去行餘包、價挺站、計開山東紅麥四元一角八分、又白麥四元一角半、　灣麥四元零八分至四元一角、蚌埠麥四元零五分、市上存到兩少、形勢看站、</p>
<p>晚稻包胃去三千餘</p>
<p>（滬南）　昨日各帮來源與前相仿、仍到四十餘號、（六千餘石）、惟其中晚稻則較稀、祇十數號、經客家一度競取後、形勢卽見帶緊、然究其底藴實賴於四儎泗涇貨、蓋該貨日來非常缺乏、經此行家爭先占鮮、遂各自抬提、售方亦趁機做俏、各帮晚稻亦相繼帶起、當時市形異常閙熱、直至收市、統計南北洋兩帮連剩貨共進三千餘包、行情抬起近尺、而各帮厚粳、北市雖有將次解决希望、但還原究屬非易、故此間人心安穩如常、惟胃納已不若日前之强、市况因之遜色、杜尖尙屬定局、洋尖猶見挺秀、變元無榮辱、陰元頗見秀色、</p>
<p>（滬北）　各帮到貨六十餘號、市上各色去胃頗活、市形白粳羊杜埠尖帶緊扣、白元·陰元加角許、早薄稻平定、</p>
<p>大批米麫分運南北</p>
<p>北洋帮突然活動　二星期來、北洋客帮對於採購糧食、進胃不佳、以致出口稀少、昨日突見活躍、各報關行代客、紛向輪船公司預定艙位、聞本星期内、須待裝運津之麵粉、已有十萬包之數、</p>
<p>福州帮大辦糧食　閩帮客家、自中央軍克復福州、交通部准許華輪復班後、大量採購什糧、除前各輪運閩者不計外、昨日三北之衡山輪赴閩、裝有白米一萬四千餘包、麵粉九千餘包、今日新寗興輪出口、又有白米五千餘包、麵粉約七千包云、</p>
<p>糖市　本廠氷糖貨缺價堅</p>
<p>昨日糖市尙穩定、公會劃盤二四粗砂白普通貨劃十九元半、無上落、轉口貨出戶呌升一角、爲六元五角半、未成交、荷赤高貨呌十五元八角半、太古糖Ｂ嘜呌二十元、振裕一號本廠白小去一角、爲十八元七角、本廠冰貨缺頗堅、一號冰爲二十三元一角、二號冰二十二元、潮靑路有零星開出、共成交百餘包、價爲十一元六角至三角、片靑開出二百餘箱、價爲八元五角、</p>
<p>南北貨木耳軋缺再漲</p>
<p>木耳自地價回升以來、此間頗爲活動、存底軋缺·市價與日俱增、昨行盤什耳較高貨呌八十八元、普通八十五六元、比前又升四五元、</p>

<p>— 寒燧</p>
<p>戀愛忌三角或多角，因爲倘若三者勢力均等，要變成政治上的三國，相持四五十年的。打仗是更了不起的事，但每看報紙上記載，「迎頭痛擊」倒沒有什麽，一過「雙方來擊」可就壞了，總要打死若干，傷若干。其害不下於戰士的倒戈，將軍面前的間諜。戀愛無異於作戰，作戰不異於寫文章。初寫文章的人，他一定發現兩個敵人，一個在他的心中，一個在他的筆底。</p>
<p>順着一己之衝動，勇往直前，將其所要說的完全寫了出來，倘若攻擊某一種東西，必以整個兒的力量奔凑筆端，以當利刃之一擊，這應該是一道前綫。同時必有利害之顧忌，調和之意見，悲憫之心懷，阻擾這筆端這又是一道前綫。夫生而爲人，隨處皆可遇見戰鬭。有戰鬭必生進取和退嬰兩種心。進退皆行，和戰均可。惟有不和不戰，是處於雙方夾擊之中，所謂旣不能令，又不受命，必至於一敗塗地的，這是普通道理。</p>
<p>而眞正的猛士也必陷於這種境地的，如甘地，如耶穌｜｜。「悲憫他們！」「上帝給我以和平底力量！」默默地微呼｜｜旣不能忍於加諸自己的暴力，又不忍以暴力加諸使用暴力的人。雖然出自博大之胸懷，終於要發生莫大的障礙。這是極高的境地，少有的。</p>
<p>那救藥是必以自己爲主體，拿出眞的力量來。如剛勇的拳師，任普通人打了并不還手，因爲覺得敵人太渺小，容忍他，如大富翁失掉一點小錢，倒不算一曾事。這是并非失敗的，等到遇着强敵再動手；或則和平到底，被釘十字架也無怨言，不但將敵人看的不算一會事，并連自己也看的不太重要。這需要更大的力，眞功夫。那時不但雙方夾擊，就是整個的包圍也無功；三角化爲賀圈，自己隨便作成中心，這圓圈也由自己决定。｜｜</p>
<h3 id="c226">憶杜亞泉先生 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 克士</p>
<p>我看到亞泉先生所寫的書已經很久遠了，但是認識他却不過六七年前的事。這時候他年紀不過五十餘歲，然而已很瘦，很老了。</p>
<p>亞泉先生很愛講話而且愛笑。不喝酒，却愛吸烟。吸的常是「黑女牌」烟卷，是用褐色的紙卷着黑褐色烟絲的。據說普通烟卷中常有辟克聶克酸，此種烟裹却沒有，味道也還好云。每次談話，常常涉及各種的問題，科學的，社會的，或關於麻雀牌的來源。個人的私事却很少談起，因爲他是向來就不大計算自己的利益的。</p>
<p>亞泉先生談話時，意見雖常和别人不同，然而見解很淸楚。有一次聞一位談話者講起有些改革了的國度的人民的生活苦，他便毫不遲疑的回答：</p>
<p>「那倒是常態的，大家生活的刻苦一點，倒是正常的現象。像有些人過分的物質享受，多數人却在飢餓，這才是病態呵！」</p>
<p>說時一面點着頭，將說畢時還帶着笑。這笑透進對方的心裹，會使他覺得自己的判斷不眞確起來。</p>
<p>亞泉先生談話時，很關心於中國的將來，我幾次聽到這樣的議論：「中國人應亟謀自給，倘長此被帝國主義剥削下去，結果必至不可設想。」因此他不喜歡買辦階級，說應該辦消費合作。他相信只要憑着理智去說明，一定能够說淸楚，於是他後來接辦了一個學校。</p>
<p>他對學生時時講起這意見，呌他們千萬不要做買辦，然而這說敎的結果使他很灰心。他有一次對我說起，靑年中固然多有好的，但是有些人終於夢想到美國去。亞泉先生並不反對留學，但他恐怕到美國去學不到什麽，反而愈加容易走到做買辦的途上去。</p>
<p>學校後來終於關了門，這不是全由於主辦者的灰心，主要原因是經濟不能再維持下去了。有些學校裹，學生的飯菜裹所用的筍往往發綠得將要變竹的，用到菱白時，也往往已有斑斑的黑點。但是亞泉先生說靑年的食品必須有足够的養分，所以飯菜必須好。廚房說那很容易辦，只要加飯錢。於是加了錢。這一類的事情很不少。於是他的數千元貯蓄不久就用完了，只好把學校收了塲。但從這經騐裹，使他知道了欲說明一個觀念之不容易。</p>
<p>不久，一二八事情爆發了，他從火綫下走出，回到故鄕，仍然編書。到去年暑假時編好一部七十餘萬字的詞書，這是得别人的帮助而寫成的。暑假末，來到上海，這是我和他最後的會面了。這時候，他更老而且衰弱，雖仍然愛談講，但已不如從前的愛笑。吃飯時，他還告訴我許多鄕村中的情形。</p>
<p>此後又寄來數次信，有一次告訴我曾患肺炎，經洽療後，生命大槪已經無妨，不過尙須休養數日耳。可是相隔不多久，卽得友人的報告，說有一晚上他忽然顧慮到將來的許多問題，精神過於興奮，徹夜不睡，次日體温又增高，病勢轉成沉重，已於六日（去年十二月）去世了。</p>
<p>這消息的傳來，不覺已是一月多前的事，但回憶過去，亞泉先生談話時的聲音笑貌，却一一如在目前似的。</p>
<h3 id="c227">關於陶淵明 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— 孤雲</p>
<p>讀一月三十日自由談，曹聚仁先生評畫一文，有關於陶淵明的話，我覺得陶公受誣，所以想也談幾句，以就正於曹先生。</p>
<p>原文云：『陶淵明雖或「懷良辰以孤往，或植杖而耘耔」終究「登東臯以舒嘯，臨淸流而賦詩。」不與農民爲伍。這種田園詩人有如雲中白鶴，偶或棲身隴畝，實在「不知稼穡之艱難」的。』</p>
<p>淵明實在是一個農夫，不僅與農民爲伍而已。他自「不能爲五斗米折腰」以後，便歸去種田以至於死。因爲他讀了書能作詩，所以在勞作之餘，有「舒嘯」「賦詩」的事。他比普通的農夫多了這樣一椿技能，所以他以此自娛，也正如現在的勞動者中之有會哼幾句二簧的差不多。他之所不同於一般詩人者正在他是一個農夫。自來以「陶謝」「陶柳」「陶韋」並稱，都是僅僅文字上皮相。康樂，柳州，蘇州的生活如何能與陶比？陶的飲酒也如陶的賦詩，都是身體勞動之後纔去享受的。這種「享受」是「蘇息」，是勞動者三經地義的需要。古今一切冒牌農夫的詩人都不得盜竊陶公以自喻。試讀關於陶的記載、和一部淵明詩，他的力作，他的固竊，他的忍飢，他的窮快活，一一跳躍在我們的目前。我們不用掉書袋，只就平日讀着玩的幾首如「種豆南山下，草盛豆苗稀。晨興理荒廢，帶月荷鋤歸。道狹草木長，夕露霑我衣。···」「···秉耒歡時務，轉顏勸農人。···雖未量歲功，卽事多所欣。耕種有時息，行者無問津。日入相與歸，壼漿勞近鄰。···「···開春理常業，歲功聊可觀。···田家豈不苦？弗獲辭此難。四體誠乃疲，庶無異患干。　濯息簷下，斗酒散襟顏。···但願常如此，躬耕非所歎。」這些詩上都可以看出他的自畫像，使我們無法否認他是個農夫，｜｜不過是一個會作詩的農夫而已。</p>
<p>淵明少日當然是士子。其所以終於作了農夫，正是表現了他的思想和人格的全部。他所處的社會，還不曾產生馬克思，還沒有階級鬥爭的意識和情緒。他所受用的完全是儒家思想，表現了眞正儒家的精神。他不是沒有政治理解和能力的。但他覺得如若小己的行爲不乾凈，「吃官飯」，「心爲形役」，那就根本錯誤。這樣的人决不能去幹政治，幹了只是添幾個貪官汚吏。所以他寗可躬耕，吃自己勞力的收穫。收穫不足，飢寒困頓，亦决不移。如是以至如死！</p>
<p>我友潘君論陶曾有這樣的話：「陶公生活有全體一貫的精神。他那强毅的意志所發揮的人格，實是一個堅苦，勇猛，平凡，偉大的英雄。···他看不慣當時那種僞飾淸高，而實際卑汚苟且的風氣，不願同流合汚。又不樂「心爲形役貪戀口體的舒服。但無論如何，衣食總是要謀的。旣不顧哺糟　　，於是他便决然去作農夫以至老死。這是陶公看得眞作得出的過人大識力大勇氣。他在最簡單的「自己勞動以謀精衣糙飯」的基礎上，建立了完全一貫的生活體系。······」（全文見去年北平中法大學月刋。）</p>
<p>潘君此言，我完全同意。所以引出來以爲論陶之一助。</p>
<p>（附記）我與曹先生不曾識面。但每從自由談上讀到他的淸健的文字。常常想見其人，敬愛其人。曹先生那首評畫的文，也不過偶爾順筆提及淵明，在全文中不居重要地位。我因爲自由談並非艱深的純文藝刋物，乃是供給社會一般讀書人看的報紙。又因曹先生文中所言使我想到今日中國一些政治人物令人難受。所以樂於藉曹先生的順筆之言，談一點關於淵明的事。這於一般人或者不無小益。並非對曹文有所吹求。｜｜這本不待聲明的。誠以今日說話不容易，故畫蛇添足如附記所云。</p>
<h3 id="c228">鄕村的早晨 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— 何德明</p>
<p>鄕村的早晨是淸麗的，寂寥的；露水像珍珠一樣，掛上屋簷的蜘蛛網；掛上茅舍門前的皂角樹，櫻桃樹；掛上草墩上的蒲公英，狗尾草，···太陽在東山頂露出紅臉，萬丈的光芒刺破薄薄的紫褐色的霧衣，陽光射過一串串露珠，閃閃爍爍地，像夏夜的流螢在荷塘邊跳舞</p>
<p>「小黑子！這麽早就下田去？」</p>
<p>王大伯在草墩上曬太陽，嘴裹含着一支旱烟桿，對一個牽着牛擔着耒耙的中年農人說。</p>
<p>「王大伯你眞早啊。」</p>
<p>中年農夫對王大伯笑了笑，便趕緊地走上山腰去了。</p>
<p>「這年頭誰都够勤苦了，但是米價是跌得多呌人害怕，榖價是每擔二元還不到，···」</p>
<p>王大伯猛猛地吸了幾嘴烟，吐出一朶朶烟圈，像是很感嘆地自語着。草墩下突然跑上一隻黑花貓，牠跑到王大伯脚邊就蹬着，兩隻眼睛朝王大伯望，嘴裹咪咪呌着。王大伯把烟桿子輕輕撫弄牠的頭頸，牠便漸漸靜默着，用牠自己的脚爪儘在搔癢。</p>
<p>「阿毛！快到爺爺跟前來。」</p>
<p>王大伯拉長了嗓子朝着草墩下喊，草墩下的人羣騷亂得像在演戲，小孩子在鬭草，捉迷藏；中年的婦人門在揀荳芽，麗蘿蔔絲，還有幾個老年的婦人在補破襪子，補那一件件千窗百孔的破衣裳，···</p>
<p>「爺爺！爺爺！···」</p>
<p>隨着王大伯的呌聲，一個八九歲左右的小孩子，就像箭一樣地從草墩下飛跑上來，那小孩爬上他的膝蓋，左手攀着他的衣袖，右手直將他的鬍鬚，嘴裹不停留地喊着「爺爺」。</p>
<p>「阿毛！爺爺好？媽媽好？」「爺爺好！爺爺好！」「爺爺好在那兒？」「爺爺會講故事我聽，會給我沙豆吃，會給我煨蕃薯，···」</p>
<p>「爺爺這樣好，那給爺爺香香嘴可好？」「不！爺爺有鬍鬚，要刺嘴的。」「不給爺爺香嘴，爺爺便不疼你！」「爺爺鬍鬚像狗杞子，要刺破我的嘴的！」</p>
<p>「好阿毛，我的好毛頭，給爺爺香一個吧。香一個吧，好乖乖！哦，這才乖！再來一個。」「不來啦，刺嘴的！」</p>
<p>阿毛從爺爷膝蓋上溜了下來，一邊摸摸自己嘴巴，一邊便仍舊箭也似地飛跑下草墩去了。王大伯看看自己孫子逃避了去，便再拿起烟桿猛吸着，一朶朶烟圈，往空氣裹飄着，飄着，···</p>
<p>「人家有籮。借了米，就連扁担繩子也要借給你挑回家的。」「這樣好！」「可不是眞的。」秦大娘的回管使連弟高興了。三嬸媽避開了，說：「秦大娘有什麽話就招呼連弟吧。」「沒有什麽話了。進了城，連弟要聽三嬸媽的話。」她又凑近女兒的耳邊說：「換下的衣服不要忘記了。」連弟只點着頭，却想不到會眞要換什麽衣裳。外邊的天色才亮了一會兒，天空裹滿是灰沉沉的雲，冷風在荒凉的田野上和衰落的村莊上吹着。秦大娘站在土坪上仰首看天色，推測雨是不會下的。在遠處已經有人俯着身體在尋野菜了。</p>
<p>看着連弟和三嬸媽的笑容，她就勇敢地讓女兒進志，在痛苦中她希望着有一天沾到女兒的光。</p>
<p>「我們還是趁早進城吧。」「好，跟三嬸媽進城吧。記着，要聽三嬸娘的話，還有衣裳。」於是連弟帶着笑容跟三嬸媽走了。彼此告别過，還祝了平安。走了好遠，三嬸媽回轉頭說，「過一陣接你進城啊！連弟也回轉頭，說：「媽，你等我帶米來家吧！」連弟的聲音裹帶着笑，秦大娘還看得出遠處女兒的快樂的姿態。她轉身進了門，悲慟立刻襲來，她的眼涙簌簌地淌下來了。好像身上的某部份頓然失去了一般，她不能讓女兒去，哀痛着自疚着，她想馬上追出去，把女兒呌回來，她立刻跨出門坎，只看見女兒的影子漸漸小去，她終於沒有勇氣呌出一個字。她傷心地哭着，但女兒是走了，女兒的影子還留在她的心上。那臨去的笑呵。過了好，也沒有人勸，她便止了聲，抽咽着，帶着兩個哭紅腫了的眼眶，提着一個小破竹籃和一把生銹的鐵剷，習慣地走出門，預備去挑野菜。</p>
<p>在田塍上，她抬頭看天，低低自語着：</p>
<p>「怎麽還沒有太陽呢？」（完）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3 id="c229">論「賣文爲活」 <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— 阿曇</p>
<p>一九三夺年下半年「作家之羣」對于「批評家「進攻」了一次。一九三四年開始，沈從文先生在北方（天津　）對「海派」文人襲擊了一下，曹聚仁先生就給了他一個有力的回答他說明「京派」「海派」同樣應該盪掃而兩者比較之間却與其「京」也寗「海」。</p>
<p>總計沈從文先生等對于海派文人的攻擊最大的罪狀就是「商業競爭」，這裹所謂「商業競爭」是包刮很多的，但因此我就想起了文人「賣文爲活」一件事來。「賣文爲活」翻譯成白話就是「寫文章吃飯」。</p>
<p>本來「寫文章吃飯」是和做工吃飯一樣是是極正當的。在目前文章本來是商品，他們的要寫一些較有意義，較進步的東西，就和藥房賣魚肝油，不賣砒箱同樣。當然在賣錢之外他們還可有别種用意，但這也正和開藥房的人在賣錢以外，還有濟世的作用一樣，而濟世，仍然沒有妨碍賣錢。</p>
<p>開藥房的人假使只爲賣錢而製造砒霜春藥，自然是不對的；那末文人們所寫的假使不是只爲賣錢的那些封建的色情的東西，是沒有什麽罪惡的。</p>
<p>杜斯退益夫斯基的小說，幾乎沒有一篇不是逼出來償僨，或則賣錢吃飯的但是杜斯退益夫斯基依舊是世界上最偉大的寫實主義的作家。所以文章賣不賣錢是沒有關係，所要注意就是作家是不是爲了錢而背叛自己的主張，和藝術的本身｜｜眞實。作家費了勞動力而寫成的東西是該得到工資的或則代價的。</p>
<p>但是在目前人們却正在拿「寫文章吃飯」來攻擊人，而被擊的人，也面紅耳赤極狼狽之至的掩飾着。這到底什麽道理呢？</p>
<p>簡刮的說這是攻擊的與被反擊的的意識關係，他們雖則站在敵對的地位，但是有一個共同的見解就是文學是淸高的，而賣錢是惡俗的。文學作者而寫文章賣錢就是墮落，凡是要賣錢的文章總不是好文章，因此攻擊　人找到被攻擊的人的寫文章吃飯就好像發覺了對方的密謀和私隱，振振有辭的提出來，而被攻擊的人也好像眞的被對方發覺了密謀和私隱惶惶無地。你越是掩飾越是覺得寫文章吃飯是恥辱的，人家就越有利的拿這點來攻擊。自然在掩飾着自己的寫文章吃飯的人中定有爲了賣錢而背叛了自己的主張，背叛了藝術本身｜｜眞實性的；但這種人是不在我說的範圍以内的。</p>
<p>攻擊寫文章吃飯的人，大槪自己是有一個其它職業的。我們且不要說他的靠那種職業吃飯是和寫文章吃飯沒有分别，就是他們自己寫的文章也决不肯因爲自己有其它職業而不拿稿費。說得刻薄一點，就是他那篇攻擊人家寫文章吃飯的那篇文章，就是拿稿费甚至爲了稿費而寫的。</p>
<p>「文章無用」的名言我們早已聽到，現在文章的只能够換取飯吃本已十分悽慘。（自然我并不是說文章能够安邦定國）何况，不景氣的狂風一掃寫文章吃飯的人快要「連西風也喝不飽」，更加之以不寫文章吃飯的人奚落，寫文间吃飯的人實在只有告地狀的一法了。假使說告地狀也是寫文章吃飯，那末只有乾脆的餓死了。正是：</p>

<p>— 慧人</p>
<p>像霧一般似的悲哀繞住了我底身子的全都。</p>
<p>懷着惘悵的心景，從都市的一角踏着頽喪的步調來送你南下。</p>
<p>江風踏着波浪虎虎的吼着，吹在臉孔上手上儘是那麽地冷冰，像針一樣地刺進了我那空虚的心房。那黃色輪船，黑色的烟圈，銀色的天空，一直在向我閃着眼睛，我是那麽的貪婪的向牠們注目的視着，想把它刻在我底腦裹永久地永久地，像將别的情人一樣。</p>
<p>人們是歇司的哩歐的喧嚣着，像征人上戰塲一般的昂激，我只有悄悄地在人叢中擠着，顯然我沒有他們那麽的歡榮，我只是那麽的憂鬰，那麽的悲哀。</p>
<p>我知道我是不應該在你的歸途時有所不吉利的表示，我是裝上了面具，套上了虚僞，在向你照呼着，但是我的手是多麽的顫動，我的心是多麽的辛酸，恨不得做在你底懷中痛快的哭一下，但這眞情的表示有人說是無恥的，可笑的；唉，社會是多麽冷酷啊！</p>
<p>但是，你是不會被悲哀占了你底心境，你是快樂的，明亮的，像可愛的春光一樣。這些，你底眼睛曾告訴我。當然，你是應該要愉快的，因爲你將要重新跌入你故鄕的懷抱裹。那時，你底雙親會向你微笑，你底兄弟們會向你問好，你底小姪兒會向你撒嬌。你將跑進山谷重温那别後的風趣，你也會在淸晨的空氣裹呼吸着你故鄕的芬芳，你也會同家人互訴着别後的心曲。</p>
<p>是的，你是歡快的，我也祝福着你，你一定會在歸途的黑夜裹吹不眘東海的海風，而安適的做着甜蜜的香夢。</p>
<p>我不會妒忌你的，雖然我對於你的南下有所留戀，本來我是沒有資格配做你底朋友的，我只有孤寂的命運住在暗室中發牢騷；我也只有流浪的命運，不久，我將離開這咀咒的都市｜｜上海</p>
<p>我祝福你，友人，像朝露般的明亮在你底征途！</p>
<p>我祝福你，姑娘，像玫瑰花般的美好，永久地！</p>
<h3 id="c231">夜 <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— 再芒</p>
<p>夜，攫去了黃昏，就像魔鬼帶走了一條微弱的生命；沒有反抗，也沒有呻吟，牠，｜黑暗的夜，便佔據了空間所有的一切。</p>
<p>看哪！這人生劇塲的後臺。</p>
<p>美麗也許正是醜惡，猙獰的面孔更現出了靑筋，一切藉了夜的掩護而活躍而舞蹈！夜，對於一部份人是神秘的！</p>
<p>「來！酒！肉！狂吧！醉吧！我們有的是性慾，也有的是金錢！盡量的享樂吧！趁着黎明還沒有代替了夜之前！」</p>
<p>然而···</p>
<p>多角形的夜，迴旋着，迴旋着，牠軋出了滿溢的酒沬，同時也軋出了生命的血！</p>
<p>小丑收歛了笑容，只有在深深的夜裹，他撫摸着自己的傷痛！</p>
<p>爲了生活，她們零碎的割下自己的肉，出賣給同是「人」的人們！那血淋淋的笑啊！</p>
<p>日裹，過分的勞動還不能使自己不餓，于是，夜裹，便不得不犧牲了睡眠！工作！工作！那結果眞是爲了自己的生活嗎？</p>
<p>多少受社會鞭韃着的人們，在這漫漫的長裹絞着他們的腦汁！</p>
<p>夜啊！爲什麽你只把甜蜜的夢給了一部份人們，而把不幸者更踏在脚下呢但是，當那天明水一般的太陽升　來的時候，夜，你將躱到那裹去？</p>

<p>— 麥夫</p>
<p>有許多外國人是不知道拿中國筷子吃飯的，這本是種事實。然而若說給鄕下人聽，他們是不會相信的。有許多高貴的小姐太太們，是不知道御用那鄕下毛坑的。若說給都市裹的人們聽，怕也是不會相信吧。然而這一樣也是事實。</p>
<p>外國人不知道拿中國筷子，是因爲他們沒拿用過，所以如此。反過來，那般不知御用鄕下毛坑的女太太們，一樣也是她們祗御用過洋瓷抽水馬桶，望着鄕下那簡陋的木板構成的杭厠，自然是會張皇起來。</p>
<p>本來沒用過的東西，或是丢久了沒用的東西，是難得知道御用的。比如有許多大官爺，離家鄕久了，便本地話也說不來，也是同此一理的。因爲大官爺雖然也是鄕下出來的，然而到底官腔說得多，這樣，自然人就進化了，結果便是把那不堂皇不漂亮的本地腔，率然的抛棄了，自了是應該的。</p>
<p>雖然在沒有洋瓷馬桶以前，女太太們也是要登坑的，但到底那是那時的女太太，這是不能一槪而講，一個時代有一個時代的文明，一個時代有一個時代的享受。所以一般的嬌嫩的女太太一臨近那鄕下又黑又髒的毛坑兒，就那麽嬌滴滴的驚呌起來而莫知所措，怕也是應該的吧。</p>

<p>— 宸</p>
<p>社會科學家告訴我們，社會的現象不斷的處於矛盾之中，而社會的進化卽在矛盾中逐步向前發展，因此矛盾乃進化的要素，有矛盾，斯有進化，求進化，亦必基矛盾，這已成爲一切社會事態變化，「定律」。中國傳痕遍體，瘡痍滿目，而衝突矛盾之處，在在皆是，自然在此極端的「矛盾」中；愛用此律，亦必有非常的「發展」存在，考之實際，也確乎有事可徵。不過中國是有「特殊國情」獨别環境的，其發展進化就不能不有其「迴異常」之道。</p>
<p>國家前途民族命運且置勿論，姑就「無關宏旨」之民風俚俗而言之，每至電燈初放霓虹映彩時。我們一到這東方巴黎的中心地帶，便見柏油馬路兩旁，卽</p>
<p>迎風鵠立，整列成隊，貯候時機向人播送；而巍峨　立之大飯店旅館及許多里衖院寓，亦爲買一夜之歡者大開「方便之門」，僅計上海一日之内，一切之間，正未知向許多陽台客傳播幾許「病菌」種子。但是若再向街頭一瞥，便有無數的醫院與疹所，「專治五淋白濁」，「保險除根永不復發」的招牌，則櫛比相連，隨風飄舞。這種現象自然不免「矛盾」，但是却能發展，「么二長三」愈多，花柳醫治緊務亦愈盛。</p>
<p>再如「燕子窠」，成天成夜躺滿了黑藉人們了其生意興隆利市百倍的現象，遠非陷於凋敝民「百緊」所可比擬。但是穿過這一吞雲吐霧的氣雰加以透視，小之則有「戒烟」「淸血劑」的傳單廣告，大之則有森嚴堂皇的禁令。這一相反的事實，也不得不承她有些矛盾，但是矛盾中却能發展。禁令越嚴，絶非是「雲土」「人頭土」消潔的表露，而「寓禁於徵」，正是說明「禁令」下一般「雅室」「談心處」大可發展的事實。表面上極相衝突，實際上則相法相成。</p>
<p>這一種光怪陸離的景象，卽成了中國社會事態矛盾發展特殊的「迴異尋常」之道。所謂「矛盾的發展」，通常是指在千瘡百孔的衝突潰敗中，新的進步的力量，代替了舊的保守力量，而中國各種社會現象在矛盾中的發展，却是兩種對立的「矛盾」的增加。不爲「矛盾的發展」。而威「發展矛盾」。</p>
<p>談到中國貧窮的根源，只要不加以諱飾，誰也承認是鬩爭不已内戰潮年，而内戰之所以發生則爲各自擁兵自守割據稱王所造成。是以中國之兵多與勇於内戰，幾乎與國家貧弱的現象處於不能并存的「矛盾」地位中，但因特殊「國情」之故，却是愈貧困，而内戰與兵軍則愈多，戰爭與軍隊愈多，中國愈益貧困，這一「矛盾」始終未見有新的力量來代替，仍自成爲一個「發展」的現象。</p>
<p>欲求「瀟湘館」「怡紅院」與五淋白濁醫院相列並存的現象消滅，必須下一番「十年一覺揚州夢」的改悔工夫，要免除滿地芙蓉與禁令滿天下的奇觀，也得吃幾戒闢丸」，要挽救貧弱與戰爭平行發展的病態，若覺得精神上的「翻然改悔」及内服的「膏丹丸散」不能奏效，那恐怕只有施行外科手術一法了。</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我前承親友介紹，許與王姓爲室，尙未結婚。刻下我聽說他方不擬正式結婚，而要實行陋俗「搶親」，我雖知識淺薄，對於搶親，却不勝憤恨，故此我不願與他成婚，我想登報聲明，與他解除婚約，不受此種拘束，但未知法律上有否規定，故特具字懇求一一賜答，此頒撰安　李世灝謹上</p>
<p>編者按：「搶親」確是一種惡俗，在法律上是不承認的。你因爲對方要實行搶親之故，而要解除婚約，是可以辦到的，固然「搶親」這種惡俗，我們是反對的；然而這也祇是結婚手續的不合法，並非是對方待你怎樣不好，所以我們以爲，你對於解除婚約的手續可暫時不問，你現在可先想想，究竟願不願與對方成爲終身伴侶，如果你是願意的，那你就不應當解除婚約了，你可向對方提出警告，聲明你對於「搶親」是决計不願的，讓他不要妄想。但若對方實是不克舉行繁重的結婚典禮，那你也應當原諒他，不要過分苛求，讓他舉行簡單的婚禮好了。如果對方能聽從這種辦法，豈非較「解除婚約」圓滿多了麽？當然，這個辦法是從「你願意嫁他」這一點着想。如果你和他沒有愛情，並且不願意嫁他，藉此解除婚約當然是最好沒有了。</p>
<p>「解除婚約」須要經過相當法律手續，不是登報聲明就可了事的。這個問題你最好去問問律師。</p>
<p>末了我們對於「搶親」，對有點話要說。</p>
<p>「搶親」這種惡俗同是極應取締，但是對於發生「搶親」的原因，却也不應不研究，不應不想法取消。「搶親」所以發生之主要原因，大約是，男方經濟困難。。不克舉行繁重的結婚典禮。固然「結婚」是人生中極重要的極有意義的一件大事，在理對於「結婚儀式」應當十分講究，親戚朋友應當都邀來，熱閙一塲，然而爲了這種原故，就把一般「結婚」所需的費用水準提得很高，以致在不顧社會非難的人衆中就則實行「搶親」或其他辦法以避免此難，在愛好面子的人，則以向各處借債而勉强舉行，却是一個悲劇。由「搶親」成婚的人，不過會常常受到他人的誹笑，譏諷罷了，舉債成婚的人則就苦不堪言，結婚之後要還大批的賬，同時家庭日常開銷亦較前加大，因結婚而畢生感到經濟恐慌和壓迫者實是不計其數。在另一方面，則有因經濟困難而遲婚，不結婚的事，然這也不是好辦法；結婚少化些錢，少負此債，纔是正當的道理。因此，我們現在極願提倡婚禮的「簡單化」和「經濟化」，希望以後不要再在賓朋滿坐充滿着喜氣的嘉禮中，「埋伏下了畢生要忍受的陰霾　　的人生痛苦。」</p>

<p>克佳猛的抬起頭來，揉着眼皮，不信自己沒有看錯人，驚奇地「咦！你···」</p>
<p>「這般好睡，昨夜在什麽地方？」女子諷刺地問。</p>
<p>「别打趣，都爲了小弟弟。」克佳指着效蓀解釋，接着問：「你也今天剛到上海去？」</p>
<p>是我妹妹結婚啊。」還未說了，美的地笑着對效蓀。效蓀如她雖是第一次會面，他可知道是靜宜的姐姐靜文了。自然，靜文也熟知朱效蓀這個名字的，不過，小弟弟，那怪不倫不類的稱呼，她沒有預料到就是這位妹夫的老朋友。效蓀明曉得她的意思，忸怩着。　　「哈。」不脫野牛的本色，拳頭碰着自己</p>
<p>妹的姐姐胡靜文。」</p>
<p>粗野的介紹了，於是開始他的演講：</p>
<p>「去年年底小弟弟被我强迫着到杭州來養病，至少一半也是他自願的。這頭脫了韁的野馬我常是無法對付的，最近他寫來一封信，像哀的美頓書似的，所以我特地到杭來請他到上海去。靜文，你知道他說什麽？」頓了頓，似乎候雙方的回答「却要過了我的Ｗeddi　g再到上海，爲的是｜見不得一個女人。哈哈。」</p>
<p>「朱先生，可是眞的？」自然，打趣式的故事使靜文狐疑起來。效蓀無可奈何的笑了，搖着天然鬆曲的頭髮。「還有假的不成？」挺直了腰，滿有樣的運動家。「那末，那女人是誰呢？」「是你的同學吧？徐勤菠。」「這有什麽見不得的道理？」「問小弟弟罷。」效蓀神經質的釘了克佳一眼，要是可能的話，他立刻回杭州去。在一個女的面前，他旣不能施展他的皮氣，又恐怕無邪的靜文問出：「朱先生，倒底是怎樣一回事？」來。他自認失敗地在手提臬揀出一册書，避去了對方的視綫。</p>
<p>克佳呢，他雖然老實不客氣，可是他也知道在這樣的情形之下不可把朱效蓀來作談話的重心了。他乾咳了幾聲嗽，換了話題。</p>
<p>「靜文，你接到她的信嗎？」　　「信是早接到的···」一個聰明的女子，她明白一切，她態度變得十分鄭重「學校方面一時沒有相當的代課，終於還是校長兼代了，所以我纔得今天脫身。下學期我想還在上海找工作，妹妹嫁了，總不能把媽也嫁了···」</p>
<p>效蓀聽着笑了起來，他將翻着第一頁的的一册小說隨手合了。克佳見機地掏出捲烟，才打開陰暗的局面。</p>
<p>三個人抽着烟，向三月的春風飛散，輕輕地。</p>
<p>悠的車身震動了，尖銳的一聲汽笛，慢慢地駛進楓涇站。克佳舉起他肥大的手掌，伸到窗外去抓住一個小販，效蓀像得了機會似的凑在克佳背後說：「妹妹喜歡吃楓涇蹄子的，買幾籃帶去。」</p>
<p>野牛手中已揀起四個籃頭，他沒有細味效蓀的話，又打趣的！</p>
<p>「小弟弟，你的媽幾時生小妹妹的？」</p>
<p>「姐姐的『妹妹』胡靜宜。」勝利地笑了，搖動着天然鬆曲的頭髮。「這樣說來，我的媽不　不和妹妹一同出嫁了。」神經質的笑，無邪的笑，不自然的微笑，將一切悲哀掉在歡樂後面。</p>

<p>〓Mao Wei-shou and Zhang Yan Telegraph Acceptance of New Posts〓</p>
<p>There Was No Gathering in Longyan</p>
<p>Hangzhou Headquarters Issues Special Statement</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) On the 1st, the General Staff Office of the Hangzhou Military Affairs Committee issued the following official statement: A report in the Fuzhou Daily News on the 31st stated that the majority of the 19th Route Army had gathered in Longyan and sent representatives to Jiang Dingwen in Fujian Province to present two demands as preconditions for reorganization. This is purely a fabrication by reactionary elements, and a thorough investigation has been ordered. In fact, the remaining troops of the former 19th Route Army numbered only seven or eight thousand rifles. On the 25th, Mao Wei-shou and Zhang Yan, in compliance with orders, accepted reorganization and voluntarily moved east from Quanzhou to the Putian and Fuqing areas for deployment, awaiting central government demobilization. The original division, brigade, regimental, and battalion commanders of the 60th, 61st, 78th, and 49th Divisions have all been replaced and dismissed, and Chen Pei-wen, Wen Chao-chi, Wu Cheng-ren, Yang Ting-ya, etc., have been appointed as division commanders. Each division has been reorganized into three regiments and has long since been demobilized and settled. There has not been a single soldier gathering in Longyan. The only troops formerly in Longyan were two battalions of Zhou Lixing's supplementary regiment and several hundred people who fled from Zhangzhou. We hereby issue a solemn and responsible statement regarding the deliberate rumor-mongering of the Daily News, to clarify the truth. General Staff Office of the Hangzhou Military Affairs Committee, East (1st, Special Telegram)</p>

<p>Orders Will Be Given for Four Provinces to Resolve the Issue Jointly</p>
<p>Part of the Jin Army Has Been Dispatched to Linhe</p>
<p>The Battle Situation Near Ningxia is Unclear</p>
<p>Sun's Telegram Contains No Definite Indications</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the Sun-Ma war, no telegrams have arrived in Beiping from Ningxia in the past two days, and the situation is unclear. According to relevant sources, the two armies are still bombarding the Taixiao Libai Temple. Reports of the fall of the provincial capital of Ningxia may be inaccurate. It is reported that the central government has sent a telegram to Beiping, and concrete measures for resolving the Sun-Ma issue have been drafted. If Sun's troops still do not comply with the order to withdraw, Beiping will be responsible for strictly enforcing the measures. If Sun's troops still disobey orders and advance westward, a joint force will be deployed to encircle and block them. Sun sent a telegram to Beiping, still requesting that personnel be sent to supervise the withdrawal of troops, stating that all issues will be handled in accordance with General He's orders. (1st, Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the outbreak of the Sun-Ma war, the authorities here repeatedly telegraphed Sun, advising him to temporarily remain in his original defense area and await settlement. Because Sun claimed that his westward advance was for reclamation in Woye, he obtained the consent of the Shanxi-Suiyuan authorities and sent Hou Cheng to Shanxi to negotiate everything. However, Sun disregarded the authorities' advice and has been advancing westward for several weeks, causing the border to erupt in warfare and the incident to escalate daily. In order to safeguard the overall situation in the Northwest, the central government has removed Sun from his position as Director of Reclamation in Qinghai and Western China and telegraphed the determined measures to the military authorities in Beiping, ordering them to immediately take responsibility for handling the situation. He Sui strictly telegraphed Sun, ordering him to immediately lead his troops to withdraw to the area north of Dengkou, comply with the Military Sub-Committee's reorganization, and implement demobilization. Hou Cheng returned to Beiping yesterday and immediately met with He to report that the results of his meeting with Yan were satisfactory. Yan respected the intentions of the central government and the authorities here and agreed to do his best to assist in resolving the Sun-Ma conflict and to stop providing aid to Sun's army. Therefore, the situation will take a sharp turn. However, Sun has not formally responded to the public and private telegrams issued here. It is difficult to predict whether he will sincerely obey or continue to resist orders and advance. If Sun does not comply with the authorities' orders, the authorities, in order to maintain their authority, will begin to restrain him in accordance with the measures determined by the central government, with the joint efforts of the garrison troops from Shanxi, Suiyuan, Gansu, and Ningxia. It is reported that part of the Jin army has advanced into Linhe. (1st, Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ma Hongkui's representative Bai Jianmin visited He Yingqin this morning to request instructions on everything.

Otherwise, if one side withdraws and the other advances, the military problem will be difficult to resolve.

<p>Implement a Military District System Nationwide</p>
<p>(Nanjing) It is reported that a portion of generals in the Southwest have the following proposals regarding military reform: (1) Advocate dividing the country into several military districts and implementing a military district system. (2) Advocate uniformly changing the army's organization to a division-regiment system, with the highest commander being the division commander. In the event of war, a senior official specially appointed by the highest military authority would serve as the commander. In addition, they advocate that the existing army be divided into national defense forces and provincial defense forces, designating the national defense forces solely for external defense. (3) Regarding the central military authorities, they advocate establishing naval, army, and air force headquarters. Under this headquarters, there would be three separate committees for the navy, army, and air force, each responsible for managing their respective services. The organization of each military district should adopt a conscription and discharge system. After implementing this type of organization in the future, all existing redundant military agencies would be abolished. It is also advocated that each military district should have a division of ten divisions, 200 aircraft, and a navy, which would be determined based on local needs and environment.

<p>Rumors of Communist Party Members Infiltrating and Instigating the Majiagou Mine</p>
<p>A Man Impersonating a Worker Was Shot and Killed in Qinhuangdao</p>
<p>Tangshan Public Security Bureau Chief Song Naigan Dismissed</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Kailuan Mining Bureau received a report from the Tangshan Mining Division this afternoon stating that all inside workers at Majiagou Mine are at work, and 110 outside workers received lamps, with 70% going down the mine to work. The number of workers at Tangjiazhuang, Zhaogezhuang, Linxi, and the three mines is the same as yesterday. Observing the workers' situation, it seems they do not trust the representatives coming to Tianjin. The conditions agreed upon by the workers and the mine are that the majority of workers intend to wait and see. However, with the Lunar New Year approaching, they are unwilling to continue the strike. After receiving the report, the mine has consulted with the Tianjin Workers' Representative Association, notifying workers of the settlement of the strike and advising all to resume work. Another report states that Communist Party members have infiltrated and instigated unrest in the Majiagou Mine, and the workers' situation is unstable. This morning, a young man in Western attire was found in Qinhuangdao, wearing a Ma Mining Workers' Union badge, shot and killed on the main street. A card on him identified him as Zhou Lanteng, but the mine conducted a detailed investigation and found no such person among the Ma Mining workers. Therefore, it is determined that the man must be on a mission to impersonate a worker and hide in the mining area. The Mining Bureau has telegraphed the authorities to pay attention to this. Hebei Province decided to remove and punish Tangshan Public Security Bureau Chief Song Naigan for his reckless actions in handling the Kailuan mine strike, in order to appease the workers' resentment. However, due to foreign relations, union activities are still not permitted. Tao Shangming was summoned to Tianjin by Yu Xuezhong last night to discuss measures to handle the Kailuan mine strike. Tao is scheduled to return to Tangshan overnight to carry out Yu's orders. On the 1st, the Kailuan Mining Bureau and representatives of workers from various mines signed six conditions for resuming work, which will be announced publicly after the authorities guarantee them. However, during this process, the workers' representatives promised to inform workers from various mines to resume work first. The six conditions include: 1. Restore jobs for unemployed workers. 2. For mine bureau officials who colluded with contractor workers to oppress workers, the mine bureau will cooperate with workers' representatives to investigate and dismiss them if the evidence is conclusive. 3. During the period without a union, the mine bureau recognizes the workers' representatives who signed this agreement as legal representatives, who will be the object of negotiations in the future. 4. Abolish the small contract worker system. 5. Increase the number of working days per week. Including the previous regulations, there will be a total of six working days per week. 6. Losses suffered by workers during the strike period will be compensated by the mine bureau according to the contractual and legal effect regulations, with contractor workers being punished and paying compensation. Representatives of workers from the five Kailuan mines in Tianjin are going to Beiping to appeal to the Party Department and the Political Readjustment Committee to punish Tangshan Public Security Bureau Chief Song Naigan, and they plan to demand compensation for injured and dead workers, permission for union activities, and compensation for workers' losses during the strike period. The representatives stated that if the authorities ignore them, they will legally sue Director Song in court. (1st, Special Telegram)</p>

<p>The judicial authorities believe he was attached to the rebels (Nanjing) Zhang Zilue, the chief prosecutor of the Longxi District Court in Fujian Province, served as the president of the Minhou District Court under the orders of the puppet government during the Fujian Incident. Now that Zhang has come to Beijing to visit the judicial authorities, the Prosecutor's Office of the Supreme Court believes that Zhang willingly attached himself to the rebels, which is a violation of the criminal law. Zhang was detained on the morning of the 1st and is planned to be sent to the Ning District Court Prosecutor's Office for handling according to law. (1st, Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Can Increase by 20 Million Yuan This Year</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the Ministry of Finance, unified tax is a major source of financial revenue. However, the unified tax area currently levied by the government only reaches eight provinces. The three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui are one district, the three provinces of Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei are one district, and the two provinces of Shandong and Henan are one district. Each district has one director. Fujian has one sub-director. The unified tax of the remaining provinces is still collected and used by the local administrative organs and has not been remitted to the central government. The total revenue of various unified taxes nationwide in the 22nd year was: 1) Cigarette tax 58 million yuan, 2) Cotton yarn tax 20 million yuan, 3) Wheat flour tax 5 million yuan, 4) Match tax 4 million yuan, 5) Cement tax 860,000 yuan, totaling 87.86 million yuan. Since the increase in the tax rate of matches, cigarettes, and cement (average increase of one-third) starting from December 15th last year, another 20 million yuan can be collected this year.

<p>(Nanjing) According to the Ministry of Industry, since Taiwan was ceded, the sugar industry has been in decline. Last year, customs statistics showed that 14 million dan of foreign sugar were imported, with a value of 100 million yuan, ranking second among imported goods. The government plans to revive the national sugar industry. The Ministry of Industry has drafted a plan with a capital of only 2 million yuan in national currency, but there is no definite allocation of funds. The current plan is to 1) first enable the National Sugar Manufacturing Company to resume work, 2) reorganize the Puyi Sugar Factory, and 3) establish sugar factories in Guangdong, Chaozhou, Zhangzhou, Sichuan, Jiangsu, and other places.

<h3 id="e32">The Key to Revising the Sino-US Commercial Treaty <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Ting</p>
<p>According to Article 17 of the 1903 Sino-US Commercial Treaty, the treaty is valid for ten years. Thereafter, every ten years, both parties can request revisions. January 13 of this year is the expiration of the third ten-year period. The National Government proposed to the United States before then to sign a new treaty. Reports say that the US government recognizes that China has the right to request revisions, but there are two opinions on whether to sign a new treaty: agreement and rejection. This article will focus on revising the original treaty as the object of discussion.</p>
<p>The 1903 Sino-US Commercial Treaty has a total of seventeen articles, containing ten items. 1) Sending ambassadors and establishing official positions. 2) Residence and trade. 3) Customs duties. 4) Mining. 5) Trademarks and copyrights. 6) Inland waterway navigation. 7) Opening ports. 8) Monetary system. 9) Missionary work. 10) Extraterritoriality. Generally speaking, except for the customs duties, which were separately stipulated in a new treaty by the two countries on July 25, 1929, the most important are (A) Residence and trade, (B) Extraterritoriality, and (C) Inland waterway navigation. However, in terms of the special relationship between China and the United States, (A) and (B) are the keys to future treaty revision negotiations. We believe that the residence and trade issue should focus on the right of Chinese to enter the United States and the rights of overseas Chinese in the United States, and extraterritoriality should be based on the principle of abolishing it. Now, please extend its meaning as follows.</p>
<p>(A) Residence and Trade: Article 3 of the original treaty stipulates that American citizens are allowed to travel, reside, and engage in various legal industrial and commercial undertakings in the trading places of China, and are allowed to enjoy all the benefits of the most-favored-nation treatment in China. However, on the other hand, it is not stated that Chinese citizens have the same rights to immigrate to the United States and engage in business in the United States. The most-favored-nation treatment they enjoy is only limited to the taxation of Chinese goods entering the United States (see Article 5). This is a one-sided and unequal method, needless to say. Although it is said that according to the Burlingame Treaty of 1868, there is already a clear statement that the people of the two countries mutually enjoy the most-favored-nation treatment, it seems that there is no need to repeat it here. However, the Burlingame Treaty exists in name only and has long been recognized by the world, so it cannot be ignored. The US crackdown on the entry of yellow races has long been a stain on its diplomatic history. We are heartbroken and indignant, not starting today. The 1905 Chinese boycott of American goods movement was a reflection of this psychology. The Americans knew it very well in advance, so they returned a portion of the Boxer indemnity to buy our goodwill. Today, even if we do not appeal to the sympathy of the Americans on the immigration issue from the standpoint of international morality, we can also speak eloquently based on treaty rights. The aforementioned Burlingame Treaty has already clearly recognized that [changing residence and changing nationality are natural and inalienable human rights.] It also recognizes that the free migration of the people of China and the United States from one country to another is beneficial, and the two contracting parties should not prohibit it. We must know that the Burlingame Treaty is still one of the existing treaties between China and the United States. Moreover, since 1904, there has been no new treaty between China and the United States regarding Chinese immigration. Therefore, the US government, disregarding treaty obligations and international credibility, has repeatedly used its own laws to crack down on the entry of Chinese immigrants and treat overseas Chinese in the United States harshly, which is contrary to the established rules of international law. Our country's acquiescence to its actions to destroy the treaty is a matter of fact, not a matter of law. Now, in order to learn from the past and avoid future troubles, we should take advantage of this good opportunity to revise the treaty and do our best to determine the rights granted by the previous treaty. In case it is not allowed by the facts, we must also make appropriate corrections to the current methods under the principle of not harming national and ethnic dignity. As for the property rights, business rights, and marriage rights of overseas Chinese in the United States, they should also be ensured that they are in the same position as overseas Chinese from other countries, and should not be discriminated against due to differences in skin color and nationality. I think that the Burlingame Treaty already has provisions for mutual most-favored-nation treatment. In the formal negotiation meeting, the US side may not dare to overturn it. After the Manchurian Incident, the diplomatic relations between Japan and the United States suddenly became tense. Many knowledgeable people in the United States feel that it is necessary to revise the current laws on the entry of Eastern races in order to ease the anti-American sentiment in Japan. Even the leaders of California, which has always been the most fierce in rejecting Eastern races, such as the president of the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce and the president of the University of California, have publicly criticized the current system and advocated allowing a certain number of immigrants from China, Japan, and other countries to enter the country each year under fixed limits. Those who still hold opposing views are only a portion of the labor union members, which is not enough to sway the entire US public opinion. Therefore, it is beneficial to our side to conduct immigration negotiations today. Good opportunities are rare, so don't miss them. (B) Extraterritoriality: The extraterritoriality system is originally an artificial product. The various shortcomings have long been pointed out by Chinese and foreign scholars and need not be repeated. Article 15 of the 1903 Sino-US Commercial Treaty says, [The Chinese government is deeply desirous of reorganizing its own laws and regulations in order to bring them into conformity with the laws and regulations of the Western countries. The United States is willing to do its best to assist in accomplishing this. As soon as it is found that the conditions of Chinese laws and regulations and its judgment methods, and all related matters, are all properly done, the United States will immediately agree to abandon its extraterritoriality.] It can be seen that the United States also recognizes that this abnormal system is a temporary expedient. In April 1929, Wang Zhengting, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government, sent a note to the six countries of Britain, the United States, France, the Netherlands, Norway, and Brazil, requesting sympathetic consideration for the actions to abolish extraterritoriality. The US reply, although directly stated that China's judiciary has not yet been completely independent, still expressed a willingness to participate in negotiations in order to find ways to gradually abandon its consular jurisdiction (i.e., extraterritoriality), either in designated areas, or for specific types of legal rights, or both.] Later, the National Government, because there was no concrete way to negotiate with various countries, announced the abolition of extraterritoriality on its own on December 28, 1929. This move is certainly within the scope of our country's power, but the facts prove that if you want foreigners to submit to me, you must have the strength to use the last resort. Therefore, under today's environment, the only path we can take is to start with revising the treaty. Japan used this method and was able to realize its long-cherished wish to restore legal rights. Our country can imitate it. In revising treaty negotiations, there is also a distinction between joint negotiations with the opposing party or individual negotiations. In the past, when our country negotiated the issue of extraterritoriality with major related countries, it mostly adopted the strategy of joint negotiations. The result was not good. In the future, it seems that we can change our strategy and engage in individual negotiations in order to disperse the unity of various countries and leave them no room for mutual prevarication. In those years, Okuma Shigenobu's treaty revision policy started with this method and finally created Aoki Shuzo's final victory. The National Government decided to bring up the old issue again at the Sino-US commercial treaty revision conference and seek a mutually satisfactory solution to abolish extraterritoriality, which is probably with the desire to "defeat them one by one." As for the US side's prerequisite of abolishing the system in stages or progressively by event, a portion of our country's scholars have expressed sympathy. We also feel that the countermeasures to be adopted in the future should be more cautious to avoid the blame of being too eager. Treaty revision negotiations, the government should bear the responsibility of mediating, which goes without saying. However, modern diplomacy must be supported by strong public opinion to give full play to its functions. The people of our country should express their views on the upcoming Sino-US treaty revision negotiations as soon as possible to provide support for the government.</p>
<p>Roosevelt Announces New Currency Price</p>
<p>Devalues US Dollar to 59.06 Cents</p>
<p>Sets Gold Price at $35 per Ounce</p>
<p>Purchasing Gold Domestically and Abroad</p>
<p>White House Discusses Stabilizing Exchange Rates</p>
<p>(Washington) The President issued an order today devaluing the US dollar to 59.06 cents. At the same time, the President announced that the Treasury Department would purchase gold domestically and abroad starting on February 1st, setting the price at $35 per ounce of pure gold. The President also said that this pricing has no impact on the composition and value of silver dollars. The new gold dollar contains 90% pure gold, 15 and 21/5 grains equal to 59.06 cents, and is effective from the date of announcement. Regarding the issue of stabilizing international exchange rates, the President stated that detailed discussions are currently underway and that he does not want to disturb the audience, so he cannot express his opinions beforehand. After announcing this bulletin, the President immediately summoned Treasury officials and monetary experts to the White House for discussions. (31st, National Telegraph)</p>
<h3 id="e33">London Hears Like a Bolt from the Blue <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Gold Prices Soar to New Record</p>
<p>(London) London received the news of President Weisford's announcement that the price of a thousand US dollars was 59.06, like a bolt from the blue, causing the price of gold to rise by 29 pence, which is a new record high. The price of gold is 135 shillings and 6 pence, plus an additional 15 and a half pence for the difference in French exchange rates.</p>
<p>Londoners believe that with such a high differential, profits can be made by withdrawing cash from the Bank of France. What market participants are most concerned about is what actions France will take to protect itself and avoid the withdrawal of gold, resulting in capital flowing from Paris to the United States. The export of American gold is currently purely hypothetical. President Roosevelt announced his permission to export it in order to prevent gold countries from prohibiting the export of gold to non-gold standard countries. Some quarters believe that President Luo's actions are a major blow to the UK, as he wants to force the UK to agree to stabilize the dollar-pound at a certain price. However, the British will consider this price to be an overvaluation of the pound. (1st, Reuters)</p>
<p>—Silver Dollar Weight Unchanged— (Washington) President Luo's announcement stated that the price of gold and the dollar are now fixed in order to stabilize domestic prices and protect commerce from the adverse effects of cheap foreign currencies. The weight of silver dollars will not be changed as a result of this announcement. President Luo has the power to change this announcement when the interests of the country require it. (31st, Reuters)</p>
<p>—Exchange Market Fluctuates Greatly— (London) The news that the US dollar is about to be devalued has had an impact on the foreign exchange market this morning. Various gold coins have fluctuated. The opening exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar was 5 yuan and 3 points 5, then returned to 5 yuan and 2 points 75, while the closing price last night was 4 yuan and 99 cents 7 points 5. Today's exchange rate between the British pound and the French franc is 78 francs and 16/5. The development of the securities market is limited to South African gold mining stocks, and prices fluctuate frequently, but mostly tend to rise. Other securities are also active. German securities have regained their stability, as the news about debt is quite good. French securities are still strong, and British domestic industrial securities are slightly weak, but British government bonds can still maintain their prices. The price of war bonds is 101 and 8/5. (1st, Reuters)</p>
<p>(New York) The foreign exchange market was very chaotic after President Luo issued the announcement. All prices were opened as usual, but there were no transactions. The opening price of the pound was 4 yuan and 9 jiao 7 cents, but it later weakened to 5 yuan and 4 points, 31st Reuters</p>
<p>—No Different from Restoring the Gold Standard— (Washington) From an international perspective, the new US monetary policy, although not theoretically restoring the gold standard, is practically no different from restoring the gold standard. President Roosevelt's published law stipulates that the Treasury can buy or sell gold in foreign markets to maintain the price of the new dollar against gold at home and abroad. In other words, if the dollar falls sufficiently due to international trade settlement relations, making it suitable for the United States to export gold to foreign markets and unfavorable to buying it abroad, the Treasury will export a corresponding amount abroad to correct it. As for the cash export ban, it is only nominally effective in relation to private individuals and foreign countries. If the transaction between the United States and foreign countries is taken care of by the Treasury as the general clearing agency, it can freely export or import the necessary cash, that is, to maintain the price of the dollar against gold at home and abroad, so that its fluctuations do not exceed the specified range, especially depending on international trade relations. (31st, Havas)</p>
<p>—Impact on Japan— (Tokyo) The world's financial circles are paying close attention to the news of the US President's announcement of reducing the par value. The authorities in the Japanese financial circles have the following observations:</p>
<p>Minister of Finance Takahashi said that the United States has only unilaterally reduced the par value. If it does not coordinate with Britain and France, the US dollar may be difficult to stabilize. Although it has implemented a 40% reduction in the value of paper money, it may force negotiations with Britain and France. However, judging from the past relations, it may not be easy to coordinate. The stability of the world's currency cannot be easily achieved. Japan maintains a wait-and-see attitude and has made all preparations, so there is nothing to worry about. Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan, Fukai, said that the United States' reduction of the par value is to stabilize the US dollar. However, it only does not sell gold to the central banks of foreign countries, so it is meaningless if there is no country to buy it. At this time, the two billion balance exchange funds can be activated, and the development of the situation is quite interesting. The exchange rate against the French franc may be stabilized at 6 yuan and 6 jiao 3 cents in US dollars. However, the impact on Japan and Britain, which have abandoned the gold standard, is relatively small. As for the relationship between the United States and France, it is also important because of trade relations, and only the reduction of tourists from the United States to France has a direct impact. It should not develop to the point where France stops the gold standard. However, the countermeasures of European countries in the next few days are particularly noteworthy. Okuchi Kihachi's statement said that the United States' reduction of the par value will activate the two billion exchange balance funds. There will be an exchange war between Britain and the United States. If the United States wins and the pound rises, French cash will flow into the United States, which will threaten France's gold standard. As a result, it may affect Japan, so we should wait and see how it changes in the future. (1st, Dentsu Telegraph)</p>

<p>(London) In the House of Commons today, the status of the British Fascist Party was questioned. A member of parliament asked Home Secretary Kilmore about the military activities of the British Fascist Party and the possession of armed vehicles. Kilmore replied that the Illegal Military Training Act established in 1819 prohibits all military training gatherings without official permission. If there are such gatherings now, the Home Office can take appropriate measures based on the previous law. As for the armed cars, the Fascist Party only has one specially made car to send speakers to the meeting place. The crowd laughed when they heard this. The minister continued that he is now paying close attention to the situation in order to take appropriate measures against improper developments. (31st, Reuters)</p>

<p>(Dalian) The grandness of the trial has never been seen before. The grandness of the trial has never been seen before. There are 120 strong men. In order to get a seat, they gathered outside the court in the cold last night. By 7:00 this morning, 1,500 people had come to watch, but only 400 people were able to squeeze into the courtroom, and there was no room to stand. The defendant, Dr. Kodama's younger sister, described him as a victim of male seduction and passion. Even before marrying Kodama, she was bound by love. When she confessed the details of the murder, there was no disturbance in the court, and there were even people who criticized Kodama for being ungrateful. The defendants were not questioned today.

<p>Japanese Naval Authorities Express</p>
<p>Determination to Break the Naval Ratio</p>
<p>Believe This Ratio System is Not Permanent and Unchangeable</p>
<p>Japan's Navy Needs to be Strengthened</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The 1935 Naval Reduction Conference is imminent. The Japanese parliament, which is currently in session, has been discussing this issue for days and questioning the government whether Japan has prepared a strong and concrete proposal, and what it advocates is unanimously condemning the irrationality of the naval strength stipulated by the current ratio. In view of the trend of public opinion, the naval authorities have decided to resolutely oppose the revised naval treaty based on the ratio principle at the 1935 Naval Disarmament Conference. The reasons can be divided into three:</p>
<p>1) Taking the ratio as the yardstick for naval disarmament was invented by US Secretary of State Hughes at the Washington Conference to maintain the naval strength that is beneficial to his own country, and has no lasting appropriateness.</p>
<p>2) The so-called ratio refers to the ratio of quantity and the ratio of substance. Therefore, if the United States plans to build large warships allowed by the London Treaty, Japan will also have to invest tens of thousands of yuan in funding to implement the second supplementary plan, and the reduction of the national burden, which is the purpose of disarmament, will eventually become nominal, and the threat of war will be doubled. If countries such as Japan and France are forced to adopt only the lowest ratio, it is difficult to expect the safety of national defense.</p>
<p>3) Therefore, there is a need to implement a new yardstick for disarmament, intending to maintain the naval force that Japan will decide and advocate again at the Washington and London Conferences [sufficient for defense but not sufficient for attack] as the goal, recognize its flexibility within the scope of the minimum holding volume, and allow each country to maintain the warships that it deems most appropriate. Then the lofty goal of disarmament can be achieved. (1st, Japan United News Agency)</p>

<p>Major Military Powers Agree to Disarm</p>
<p>Germany to Regain Substantial Armament</p>
<p>But Conditioned on Return to League of Nations</p>
<p>(London) The British disarmament memorandum was released tonight. The memorandum suggests that if arms adjustments and political safeguards are handled in conjunction, compromise will be easier on this broad basis.</p>
<p>The memorandum further suggests that continuously adjusting armaments, favoring one side over another, is difficult to implement. Therefore, it is imperative for the most heavily armed powers to abandon some of their weapons.</p>
<p>The suggestions in the memorandum are categorized as ensuring security, equality of rights, and disarmament. It is believed that this agreement can be achieved by meeting the major demands of all parties. The memorandum also states that Germany's return to the League of Nations is a necessary condition.

<h3 id="e39">British Disarmament Memorandum <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Seeking Solutions Where Possible</p>
<p>Europe Must Choose Between Two Paths</p>
<p>(London) The British memorandum on disarmament was released tonight, containing the essential statement: "[We must seek solutions where solutions are possible]." The memorandum is divided into two parts. The first part explains the reasons for issuing the current memorandum, stating that without new guiding suggestions, the reopening of the Geneva negotiations will ultimately lead to further disappointment. Discussions since March last year have proven that the British draft needs revision. The clause that prohibits certain countries from possessing certain weapons, while other countries in the world are allowed to possess them, is now clearly impossible. The British government believes that since one country is allowed to possess certain weapons, other countries cannot be indefinitely prohibited from possessing them. Europe must now choose between the following two paths: 1) Negotiate a convention in which the most heavily armed powers abandon certain types of weapons; 2) Agree on a treaty based on these powers agreeing not to increase their current armaments. The British government is eager to actively pursue the first path.</p>
<p>Three General Categories</p>
<p>Security, Equality, Disarmament</p>
<p>Ten-Year Term for Convention</p>
<p>The second part outlines the ways in which the British government believes a compromise can be reached, stating that appropriate provisions must be made under three general categories: 1) Security; 2) Equality of Rights; 3) Disarmament. Regarding security, the memorandum proposes adding three clauses to the British draft, clearly stipulating the responsibilities of signatory nations for preventing or remedying violations of the convention. This, together with the German Chancellor's proposal for a non-aggression pact, can achieve security acceptable to all nations. The British government considers the implementation of the principle of equality of rights to be no less important than the general principle of security. As for disarmament, the memorandum states that the most heavily armed powers may be unwilling to abandon their existing armaments, but the German Chancellor has voluntarily abandoned weapons of aggression. If these heavily armed powers make active contributions, they will surely enable all nations to reduce their armaments equally. The memorandum then lists disarmament suggestions, believing that a treaty with a ten-year term of validity can be established based on these.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Finding a Moderate Solution for Troop Numbers <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Prohibit Extra-Military Training</p>
<p>Regarding troop numbers, the British draft previously suggested that France, Germany, Italy, and Poland should each have 200,000 troops, but Germany now demands 300,000 troops. It is not impossible to find a compromise between these two figures if other countries are willing to be consistent.</p>
<p>The British government is also prepared to recognize changing the military service term from eight months to twelve months. Standardizing the agreed-upon numbers should be completed within four years. Extra-military training outside of the army should be prohibited. This prohibition should be monitored by permanent and automatic monitoring agencies.</p>
<p>Artillery and Tanks</p>
<p>Germany Allowed to Possess</p>
<p>Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria Equal to Germany</p>
<p>Regarding weapons, the maximum caliber of artillery pieces for permanent borders and fortress defenses should be stipulated by international treaty. Tanks weighing over 30 tons should be destroyed by the end of the first year, those over 20 tons by the end of the third year, and those over 16 tons by the end of the fifth year. The British government agrees that Germany's new short-service army should be equipped with tanks limited to six tons. To achieve a compromise as soon as possible, the British government is prepared to agree that Germany's new short-service army can be equipped with 155-millimeter cannons. Cannons with a caliber of over 350 millimeters should be destroyed by the end of the first year, those over 220 millimeters by the end of the fourth year, and those over 155 millimeters by the end of the seventh year. The British government is prepared to allow Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria to be equipped with equivalent artillery and tanks.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Military Aircraft <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Still Reduced According to the Draft</p>
<p>Germany Enjoys Gradual Equal Rights</p>
<p>The British government still supports the maximum limit of three tons for military aircraft as stipulated in Article 37 of the draft treaty, as well as the provisions of Articles 34 and 41, namely, that no more military aircraft shall be built except for airships, and no troop transport aircraft weighing more than three tons when unloaded. Half of the existing military aircraft weighing more than three tons should be destroyed by June 1936, and the remaining half should be destroyed at the end of the convention. Article 35 of the draft treaty stipulates that the Permanent Disarmament Commission should immediately draft the most appropriate plan for abolishing land and naval aircraft. This must rely on the strict implementation of monitoring civil aviation to avoid conversion to military use. If the Permanent Commission has not decided on a method of abolition by the end of two years, countries with military aircraft should increase or decrease them as appropriate based on the situation at the time, gradually doing so over the next eight years, so that they can eventually reach the agreed-upon numbers. Germany can therefore enjoy equal status with the major air powers through this gradual process.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Monitoring System Monitors the Implementation of the Convention <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Naval Issues Proposed</p>
<p>The British government supports the chapter on naval matters in the draft treaty, but in view of the upcoming 1935 naval conference, it is prepared to adopt a simpler proposal if necessary. The British government suggests that other issues should be resolved quickly and that this agreement should be included in a worldwide convention. This move can greatly assist the naval negotiations advocated in Article 33 of the convention. If all other issues are resolved, the British government agrees to a permanent automatic monitoring system to monitor compliance with the disarmament convention. The memorandum concludes by stating that the above suggestions are intended to meet the necessary requirements of all parties and promote a general agreement, but Germany's return to the League of Nations must be a necessary condition for this agreement.

<p>Strongly Supports German Demands</p>
<p>Mussolini's Four Proposals</p>
<p>Rome The Italian government today released Italy's memorandum on the disarmament conference, strongly supporting Germany's demands and stating Italy's four major demands. This memorandum announces the results of the meeting between British Foreign Secretary Simon and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in early January this year. The Italian Prime Minister's proposals include: 1) Abolishing chemical warfare; 2) Strictly prohibiting aircraft from bombing civilians; 3) Limiting the expansion of military expenditure, with exceptions for defense and engineering repair costs; 4) Limiting land warfare equipment according to the current situation.

<p>Paris Expresses Coldness</p>
<p>Berlin Expresses Welcome</p>
<p>(London) British newspapers have praised the British government's disarmament memorandum as a brave attempt to revive the disarmament conference, while Paris has met it with coldness. Right-wing newspapers say it is difficult to accept, and more moderate circles show no excitement. Berlin newspapers have welcomed the British plan, saying it can help the discussion of disarmament. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Although German newspapers say that the German government is currently conducting a meticulous study of the British disarmament memorandum, the newspapers show little satisfaction with the British memorandum and seem to have been instructed to publish a message stating that it is a pity that Britain has abandoned the position of governments secretly exchanging opinions. For example, an editorial in the Berliner Börsen-Zeitung stated that London seems to be plotting to implement its strategically predetermined goal, which is to make all talks held within the scope of Geneva. As for the essence of the memorandum, Britain intends to re-propose the conclusion of a universal disarmament convention, integrating and interconnecting the principles of equal armament rights and practical disarmament. In short, Britain's view of security and disarmament does not seem to open a new door. A local newspaper stated that the British memorandum considers not only the situation of the major countries that have been involved so far, but also proposes the suggestions of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Austria, Bulgaria, Hungary, Japan, and other countries. Therefore, the proposal to bring the suggestions of these countries together for negotiation will only increase disputes and is of no help. The newspapers also said that the British memorandum is not a reply to the German memorandum, but at most a draft for discussion. (Havas dispatch, 1st) (Paris) Political circles are very cautious about the British disarmament memorandum and are unwilling to express their opinions, but they say that the document has been handed over to various specialized agencies for long-term review so that the government can fully understand it before expressing its attitude.

<p>Czechoslovakia Refuses</p>
<p>Prague, according to some German sources, Germany has suggested to Czechoslovakia that the two countries conclude a non-aggression treaty, following the precedent of the German-Polish treaty. Some also say that this suggestion was to be made to Germany by Czechoslovakia. Officials in Prague claim that the German side did indeed unofficially probe the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs on this matter. The Czech government believes that there are no territorial disputes between the Czech and German states, and there is no need to conclude such a treaty, and has refused. If the treaty suggested by Germany could add some kind of guarantee beyond the Locarno Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, then Czechoslovakia might consider it, and negotiate directly with Berlin. Czechoslovakia would conclude friendly treaties with a number of countries, and even if it were to negotiate with Germany, it would first notify and obtain the consent of its friendly countries. This applies to the German proposition. As for the Czech side, it has never raised any matter to the German government in this matter, nor does it intend to automatically pursue any negotiations.

<p>Mizuno asked: Observing the current international situation, the only friendly nation in the world is [Manchukuo]. In this environment of being surrounded by enemies, the only way to save ourselves is to expand the air force. What is the government's opinion?</p>
<p>Regarding belligerent publications, how will the government crack down on them? Does the government intend to merge the Army and Navy Ministries into a single Ministry of Defense to achieve unification? Alleviating rural poverty should be approached from all sides. The cause of rural poverty lies in the poisoning of education and the excessive extravagance of weddings, funerals, and festivals. What is the government's view? The Prime Minister replied: Regarding the issue of expanding the air force, the Army and Navy Ministries are proceeding separately. We can rest assured that the two ministries will take care of it. The Minister of Justice replied: We are cooperating with the Ministry of Home Affairs to crack down on belligerent publications. The Ministers of the Navy and Army replied: The opinion on the Ministry of Defense is being studied. Observing the current international situation, merging is not necessarily advantageous.

<p>France Has the Most Aircraft</p>
<p>The United States Has the Strongest Strength</p>
<p>Soviet Russia is Now the Second Strongest in the World</p>
<p>(London) Today, British Prime Minister MacDonald stated in the House of Commons that the Soviet Union's air force is now the second strongest in the world, only slightly behind France. Since the Soviet Union has vigorously built up its air force, it has now surpassed the United States and placed Britain in fifth place. Although the United States ranks third, its strength can still be called the first in the world because the United States has six times more civilian aircraft and trained pilots than any other country in the world. Currently, the world's air forces are: France first, Russia second, the United States next, Italy next, and Britain fifth. It is said that the number of Japanese air forces is also quite large. According to the latest survey of the air force strength of various countries, France has 3,000 aircraft, the United States 2,800, Russia 1,400, Italy 1,050, and Britain 850. However, in preparation for a possible conflict with Japan, Russia has now planned to be able to manufacture 35 aircraft per day. The reason for the reduction in the air force strength of the United Kingdom is due to economic reasons and the fear that Geneva will also find ways to limit the air force. (National Telegraph, 1st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Upper House member Tsumura questioned the government, saying: Japan is a founding member of the League of Nations and has contributed greatly to world peace, but when it withdrew from the League, it was recognized as an aggressor nation and denounced by various countries. This was due to diplomatic failures and excessive statements by the military. If the current situation continues, the future outcome is not optimistic. Japan must not over-rely on military force. Throughout history, many have failed because of excessive use of military force. The government should dispel foreign suspicions about the invasion of Manchuria. Various countries still recognize Japan's aggression against Manchuria. How will the government dispel suspicions? It is also heard that Japanese officials serving in [Manchukuo] are abusing Japan's power, acting perversely, and being denounced by Manchurians. As a result, Manchurians hate the Japanese very much. How will the government correct this? Regarding immigrants to Manchuria, the military calls them armed immigrants, but in fact, Japanese immigrants to Manchuria commit all kinds of evil in Manchuria, even worse than bandits. What is the government's policy? (The rest omitted)</p>

The Bundespost said that recent events have proven that it is necessary for the leaders of the Austrian and Hungarian governments to meet, and because Italian Undersecretary of State Suvich and other political figures from various countries will soon go to Hungary, the Hungarian capital will become an important place in international politics, so the Prime Minister's trip is essential.

<p>(Moscow) After a night of anticipation, the Soviet Union finally learned yesterday afternoon that the personnel ascending to the stratosphere had tragically met with misfortune. Today, at the Communist Party Congress, it was formally announced that the gondola of the stratosphere balloon was discovered yesterday afternoon at the village of Boudi Juskstock, about 200 kilometers from Moscow. All three aviators were dead inside, one with a blurred face, difficult to recognize. It is said that when the balloon descended, it was suddenly attacked by a storm, and the balloon separated from the gondola and drifted away, while the gondola suddenly fell. When it landed, there were two loud explosions, and the instruments carried in the room were destroyed. Members of the Communist Party Congress praised the bravery of the three dead and decided to preserve their bodies. The most painful thing about this accident is that the three had just created a new world record for ascending to the stratosphere and sacrificed themselves after achieving success.

<h3 id="e90">Sun-Ma Conflict: Fierce Fighting in Ningsuo Huangxia Fengdeng <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Ningxia requests all stationed troops to encircle and attack Sun's army. Sun Dianying commands troops westward at Baofeng headquarters. He Yingqin plans to send someone to meet with Sun to discuss a ceasefire. Sun's troop strength expanded to more than 20 regiments.</p>
<p>(Beiping Correspondence): The conflict between Sun and Ma's troops was most intense around the 26th and 27th. Sun Dianying aimed to occupy the provincial capital of Ningxia, advancing in three routes. The main force, led by Yang Huifeng's 110th Division (i.e., Yang Houxiao's troops) and Wang Ying's troops from Ligangpu, advanced towards Ningxia. The left flank, led by Yu Shiming, commander of the cavalry army, supervised Zhao Guozhen's 2nd Cavalry Division and Shi Wenhua's 3rd Cavalry Division, advancing along the east bank of the Yellow River towards Ningxia. The right flank, consisting of Ding Futing's 117th Division, Liu Yueting's 118th Division, and Liu Guangde's artillery regiment, secretly crossed the Helan Mountains from Niubagou under the command of Liu Yueting. They arrived at Huangxia Pass near Ningcheng on the evening of the 26th. At 3 a.m. on the 27th, they sent more than 3,000 plainclothes soldiers, each carrying a pistol, from Huangxia Pass to outside the Ningxia county seat, scaling the city walls with cloud ladders to attack the provincial capital of Ningxia. The defending garrison consisted of Ma Hongkui's guard brigade, a regiment from Hu Zongnan's troops, and a brigade from Ma Bufang's troops. They immediately used machine guns to sweep the area, resulting in approximately 1,000 casualties among Sun's troops who fell from the city walls. Ma's troops suffered more than 100 casualties. At dawn, the fighting subsided slightly. In the afternoon, the 35th Division of Ma Hongbin's troops outflanked Liu Yueting's troops, who retreated after suffering losses. The Ningxia security police and the Han and Lu brigades, together with Ma Hongbin's troops, advanced to block them, and Sun's troops retreated to the Fengdengpu and Mandaqiao areas northwest of Ningcheng. Sun Dianying rushed to transfer Lu Fengnian's 119th Division stationed in Baotou to reinforce them. On the 29th, fierce fighting broke out again between the two armies outside the Ningxia county seat. Sun's army adopted a guerrilla-style sudden attack tactic. The Ningxia army attacked Huangxia Pass, Fengdengpu, and Mandaqiao on the 30th, and the fighting was still extremely fierce. However, since Sun's army continued to receive reinforcements from Baotou, Linhe, and Wuyuan, it would be difficult to retreat unless pressure was applied to its rear. It is reported that the Ningxia side has requested a certain military authority to quickly order Yan Xishan to instruct Fu Zuoyi, Wang Jingguo, and other troops to block Sun's army's rear, and to request that Xu Tingyao's 17th Army stationed in Baoding be sent to Baotou to encircle and attack. According to an aide-de-camp of Sun's army who came to Beiping from the front lines, the majority of Sun's troops are concentrated in the Pingluo Ligangpu area, and another force is advancing towards Ningxia, with the front lines already reaching the Beita area in the suburbs of Ningxia, and the military situation is quite favorable. This proves that the news of Sun's army retreating east of the Yellow River is likely a false report. Sun Dianying's director of the office in Beiping, Wang Shiping, visited He Yingqin on the afternoon of the 30th, requesting that someone be sent to Dengkou to investigate the truth. He then stated that in the event of a conflict between Sun and Ma's armies, it is imperative to seek a solution. The first step is for both sides to cease fire. Only after receiving telegrams of a ceasefire from both sides in Beiping can the Military Council send someone to Dengkou to discuss follow-up measures with Sun Dianying. If both sides still do not cease fire, then there is no need to send anyone. Wang replied that there is absolutely no problem with Sun's troops ceasing fire, but to prevent pursuit, it is difficult to withdraw troops before a solution is found, so he urgently hopes that the authorities will dispatch high officials to go immediately. He is currently selecting someone for the dispatch of high officials, and it is rumored that the Military Council will send member Ji Yiqiao to inquire. When they will depart is currently undecided. As for He Yingqin's representative, Men Bingyue, who was sent to the Northwest some time ago, is currently still in Suiyuan and has not gone to Baotou. He must wait until the Sun Dianying and Ma Hongkui conflict is resolved before returning to Beiping. Sun Dianying himself is currently commanding military operations in Shifeng. Sun's rear is extremely busy with troop movements, indicating that the war is still ongoing.</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Ningxia received by the 15th Route Army's office in Beiping, since Sun Dianying's troops occupied Dengkou County on the morning of the 12th, they have been advancing westward, already pressing on Ningxia. The chairman of Ningxia Province, Ma Hongkui, initially did not dare to lightly start a war because he had not received a central order to resist, so he urgently telegraphed the Central Government and Zhu Shaoliang, the Pacification Commissioner of Gansu, to report the details and request instructions. Chiang Kai-shek and Zhu Shaoliang both sent replies to Ningxia, strictly ordering them to block the attack. Chiang's telegram stated, "[Sun's troops were previously ordered to temporarily stay in their original defenses and await orders. If they rashly advance, they are acting recklessly. I hope you will follow Commissioner Zhu's orders and do your best to prevent and block them, without any hesitation.]" Zhu's telegram stated, "[Sun's troops are disobeying orders and advancing westward, invading Dengkou, colluding with bandits and communists, and disrupting the local area. You should take appropriate self-defense and severely attack them. The group telegram has been noted.]"</p>
<p>Sun Dianying's troops originally belonged to Zhang Zongchang's command. In the autumn of the 19th year of the Republic [1930], Sun's troops moved to southern Shanxi. Later, the Northeastern Army entered the customs, and Sun repeatedly sent people to negotiate incorporation. At that time, Zhang Xueliang was ordered to reorganize the military and political affairs of North China, and he convened a meeting of generals in Tianjin. At that time, it was agreed that Sun's troops would be reorganized into the Provisional 2nd Army Division, commanding two infantry brigades, a total of four regiments. In the spring of the 20th year of the Republic [1931], the Central Government revised Sun's troops to be the 40th Army Division, with the two brigades under its command being the 117th Brigade and the 118th Brigade, each with two regiments. Sun's troops also requested additional编制due to the excessive number of personnel, and Zhang Xueliang approved the addition of three infantry regiments, totaling seven infantry regiments before and after, as well as the division headquarters' directly-subordinated guard battalion, heavy mortar battalion, etc. At this time, according to its编制, the monthly经费paid was more than 190,000 yuan. In the autumn of the 20th year of the Republic, during the campaign against Shi Yousan, Sun's troops were ordered to be reorganized into the 41st Army, commanding the original troops of the division, and they were allowed to increase the monthly经费by 30,000 yuan, totaling more than 220,000 yuan. At this time, in addition to the prescribed seven regiments, Sun's troops secretly expanded several units. In the spring of the 22nd year of the Republic [1933], the anti-Japanese war broke out, and Sun's troops were ordered to participate in the war. Before being ordered to depart, they requested an increase in经费. The Military Council approved an increase of 80% of the給養for 8,000 people, approximately 20,000 yuan. At the end of the war, all the vehicles in North China were ordered to be缩编, and Sun's troops still maintained the original plan of seven infantry regiments, as well as various directly-subordinated special battalions and companies, etc. The经费was still 220,000 yuan according to the original plan, and only about 1,000 yuan was deducted from the unit's经费according to the比例of 缩编of each army. However, although the unit was still nominally seven regiments at this time, it actually secretly 收编scattered soldiers and bandits in the Chahar territory, more than doubling the number of personnel approved by the Military Council. Later, when the unit moved to western Suiyuan, it again 收编local bandits such as Yang Houxiao and Wang Ying, and privately expanded the troop numbers greatly, totaling four infantry divisions, namely the 117th, 118th, and 119th divisions, each with three brigades, each with three regiments, the 120th division with two brigades and one special service regiment, and one replenishment brigade, three cavalry divisions, each with three regiments, and three cavalry brigades, each with two regiments, one artillery brigade, three engineer and transport battalions, and two gendarmerie battalions, totaling more than 30 regiments. Those approved by the Military Council should be seven infantry regiments, and the monthly经费was more than 220,000 yuan. Since the unit privately expanded more than 20 regiments, it was only natural that its 支給was insufficient. This is why the army was so eager to move westward in order to gain a territory.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Central Army Advances to Suppress Red Bandits in Northern Fujian <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Large numbers of Red bandits discovered in Shouning, with Chen's regiments having already split up to intercept them.</p>
<p>(Fuzhou Communication): The remnants of the 19th Route Army, who had fled to Quanzhou and Yongchun in southern Fujian, were surrounded on all sides because Zhangzhou and Xinghua had been recaptured by the Central Army. They telegraphed to declare their allegiance and were granted amnesty. Chiang Kai-shek replied with an order, limiting them to three days to depart from Quanzhou and Yongchun and concentrate in the three counties of Hui'an, Putian, and Fuqing to await reorganization. The deadline has now passed, but the army has not yet complied with the order to depart. Therefore, the Central Army is still departing from Xiamen to Tong'an and Xinghua to Hui'an, strictly preventing them from fleeing again. As for the Red bandits who harassed Yong'an, Sha County, Youxi, Jiangle, Shunchang, and Yangkou in northern Fujian, Wei Lihuang, the commander-in-chief of the 5th Route Army, has transferred Leng Xin's 3rd Division to attack the bandits in Sha County. They have been engaged in fierce fighting with the bandits in the Qingzhou and Caodi areas of Sha County for days. Lu Xingbang's 55th Division has also been transferred from Datian to Youxi. According to yesterday's news, the forward troops have approached the county seat and can coordinate with Leng's Division to closely surround the bandits in Sha and You counties. The air force will then conduct bombings. In Shunchang, Zhao Guantao's army stationed on the Fujian-Zhejiang border is leading a force of two divisions from Pucheng and Chong'an to Jian'ou and Jianyang, advancing towards Yanping and Shunchang. Chen Cheng's army stationed on the Fujian-Jiangxi border is leading three divisions from Zixi and Lichuan to Guangze and Shaowu, advancing towards Jiangle and Taining, coordinating with Liu Heding's and Zhou Zhiqun's divisions to first consolidate the border defenses and then blockade the bandit areas to cause their collapse. Furthermore, in Shouning in eastern Fujian, more than 3,000 Red bandits have recently been discovered, attacking the Nanyang Township in the western district of the county, looting and burning extensively, and spreading to Saiqi Town in Fu'an County. Chen Qixuan's newly formed 10th Division has ordered Liu Jun, Chen Zheng, and Gu Hongyang's regiments to split up and intercept them. It has been determined that the Red bandits' invasion of eastern and northern Fujian was instigated by the 19th Route Army, causing harm to the local areas. (January 27th)</p>
<h3 id="e92">New Fujian Provincial Committee Chairman Chen Yi Arrives in Fujian <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>│New provincial government opening expenses are being discussed with the Chamber of Commerce│</p>
<p>Fuzhou Communication: The members of the Fujian Provincial Government have been announced for many days. Chairman Chen Yi, because he was in Beijing to negotiate important matters with Lin, Wang, and Chiang, delayed his departure from Beijing to Shanghai until January 25th. On the 29th, accompanied by Zheng Zhenwen, Director of the Education Department, Chen Ticheng, Director of the Construction Department, and Wei Datong, President of the High Court, he came to Fujian from Shanghai aboard the Ninghai naval warship. At 4 p.m. on the 30th, he arrived safely in Magong. Officials from the provincial government and the civil affairs, education, and construction departments all went to Magong to welcome him. The entire city also hung national flags to express welcome. When the Ninghai warship entered the port, warships anchored on the river surface fired salutes to pay their respects. The various steamships that welcomed him also set off firecrackers, making it very lively. Chen Yi and others came out of the cabin to nod their greetings to those who welcomed him, and then changed to the Haiping steamship, arriving at Taijiang at 6 p.m., disembarking in front of the Naval Public Office in Zhongzhou, changing to cars and entering the city to go to the provincial government. At this time, the inside and outside of the provincial government had been newly decorated, and the electric lights were brightly lit. After entering the government and meeting with various important party, government, and military figures, Chen went to the Sa Family Garden in Tangjing Alley at 7 p.m. to attend a banquet hosted by Commander Chen Jiliang, which did not end until after 9 p.m. He stayed at the Third Bridge Club outside the Water Gate. On the morning of the 31st, he paid a visit to Commander-in-Chief Chiang Dingwen and Commander Chen Jiliang to discuss matters concerning Fujian. In the afternoon, representatives from all walks of life visited the provincial government in an endless stream, and Chen himself and Secretary-General Gao Dengting received them separately. According to Chen, after the establishment of the new provincial government, the first priority is to restore the original state of the region. To restore the original state, we must start by reorganizing the remnants of the民军and整理财政. After taking office, he will immediately discuss implementation methods with all relevant parties. As for the provincial government and the various departments, it is scheduled to be taken over on February 1st, and the swearing-in ceremony will be held on the 3rd. The members currently in the province are Chen Yi, Xu Fu, Zheng Zhenwen, and Chen Ticheng. Li Shijia and Lin Zhiyuan will also fly from Xiamen to the province on the 2nd to participate. Sun Jiazhe, Sun Xiwu, and Li Qingquan are in Guangdong, Shanghai, and Nanyang, respectively, and it has not yet been decided whether they will come to Fujian. The position of Director of the Finance Department will probably be filled by Xu Fu on an acting basis. Fujian Province is in a difficult financial situation due to the initial pacification after the great turmoil, and the military affairs have not been completely concluded. Therefore, all agencies have adopted a austerity policy. The old staff of the provincial government and the four departments will be audited to determine who to keep and who to dismiss. It is rumored that more than one-third of the redundant employees will be laid off. As for financial issues, Xu Fu is currently making detailed plans to comprehensively manage all national and local taxes and levies in the name of the special financial agent of the Xingying. Before the establishment of the new provincial government, all revenue will be temporarily handed over to the Fuzhou Xingying for military use. Regarding the opening expenses of the new provincial government, negotiations are underway with the Chamber of Commerce to borrow 300,000 yuan for use. The Chamber of Commerce was affected by the disturbance of the Red bandits in northern Fujian in the autumn of last year, and the变乱of the 19th Route Army in the winter. The market is extremely depressed. It is now housing refugees from northern Fujian in the southern countryside and逆军from Nantai, totaling about 4,000 people. The给养is very expensive, and the planning is extremely difficult. It is currently discussing relief measures with the authorities. (January 31st)</p>

<h3 id="e93">Stamp Duty Inspection Causes Dispute <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Xie Rongqing, the chief accountant of the County Stamp Tax Bureau, and Yang Yongqing, the inspector, went to Qishi Town to inspect stamp duty. When they inspected the Dafeng Clothing Store, for some unknown reason, they overturned the account books and goods indiscriminately. The store believed that this was unreasonable and called the police to the scene to testify. Xie and others realized that they were in the wrong. After mediation by the town police station and the district office, Xie wrote a letter of apology to settle the matter. However, after Xie returned to Songjiang, he claimed that the clothing store's account books had underpaid stamp duty and published it in the county newspaper. The business community in the town was in an uproar. The patrol officer of the town police station then wrote a letter to prove that the store had not underpaid stamp duty, as well as the situation of Xie and others' inspection causing trouble and apologizing on that day. However, Xie still did not repent, claiming that the patrol officer had been dismissed and that his testimony was insufficient. Therefore, the new patrol officer, based on the original files taken over, issued another statement, and Xie and others' illegal actions were met with increasing uproar. It is now known that the town's士商have jointly presented a public petition to the Provincial Stamp Tax Bureau and the county government, requesting a thorough investigation and punishment to appease public anger.</p>

Recently, due to taking a concubine, he acquired many pieces of gold jewelry, which he kept at home, arousing the covetousness of robbers. One night, while Mr. Zhang was fast asleep, someone outside the door shouted, "Open the door, maternal uncle! I've brought you New Year's lucky fish!" Mr. Zhang, unaware of the trick, hurriedly opened the door. The bandits immediately rushed in, put a sack over Mr. Zhang's head, and looted the house, losing about 500 yuan worth of gold jewelry and cash. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the gang of robbers swaggered away.</p>

<p>The Public Security Bureau of this county received a tip-off that a large batch of smuggled soil had been brought in by night ferry. They dispatched eight officers to intercept it at Maogou. The officers hired a small boat to go there, and fearing a leak of information, they all wore plain clothes. As soon as they landed, they heard the sound of gongs ringing from afar. A large group of militia rushed over, and the gunfire was very dense. The officers did not know what to do. Fortunately, the boatman was quick-witted and shouted that they were police officers from Pinghu on official business, and the shooting finally stopped. Most of the residents were already terrified and scattered in all directions. Then, the militia came up to search, stating that the recent frequent occurrence of burglaries had caused a misunderstanding in the local villagers' report. They apologized and left. The officers also returned, thoroughly shaken.</p>

<p>A few evenings ago, workers on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway tried to enter the Xinmin Theater without tickets, resulting in a dispute with the theater's staff member, Mr. Lou. As a result, Zhou was beaten severely and suffered serious injuries. The night before, they went to the theater again, and the police arrested five suspects, including Yuan, and sent them to the county for investigation. The people at the bus station then used this as an excuse to strike, and buses on both the Ping-Hang and Ping-Hu routes were suspended. Yesterday, the advertisement of the Hengshengxiang Tobacco Shop in Zhapu Station read: "(Mao Fei Shan Shan Tu Si Bei) (Xi Nv Wang Jian Jin Ge Ge)" fourteen characters, and stated: "(If anyone can put together six characters, they can claim four packs of cigarettes from our store)." A road construction worker managed to do so and went to redeem them, but the shopkeeper was furious and refused to honor it, leading to a conflict. More and more workers gathered, and they almost demolished the shop. Later, neighbors persuaded the shopkeeper to give them four packs of cigarettes, and the workers dispersed, shouting. Now, Shi Zheng, the district chief of the Second District, has decided to request the higher authorities to severely punish the workers for repeatedly causing trouble.</p>

<h3 id="e102">Soong Tzu-wen Discusses the Future Work of the Economic Council <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Three Standing Committee Meetings Discussed Seven Proposals</p>
<p>Cotton and Wheat Loan Under Negotiation for Amendment</p>
<p>A Plenary Meeting Has Not Been Scheduled Yet</p>
<p>Soong Tzu-wen, Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Council, received reporters from various newspapers at his private residence on Qiqi Road at 11:00 yesterday morning to report on the recent work of the Economic Council, saying that a plenary meeting of the Committee would be convened after the general policy directions were determined to decide on specific measures. Mr. Soong's remarks are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e103">Standing Committee Discusses Proposals from Various Parties <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Soong first stated that the Standing Committee meeting had discussed proposals from various parties, including (1) Highway Planning, (2) Shipping Planning, (3) Public Water Conservancy, (4) Cotton and Silk Industry, (5) Northwest Development, (6) Jiangxi Development, and (7) Agricultural Hygiene. After discussion, it was agreed that two or three of these items should be selected for implementation first to concentrate efforts and achieve significant results more easily. If all items were to be implemented simultaneously, it was feared that there would not be enough resources, which would be inappropriate. As to which items should be selected first, it still requires careful study by the Standing Committee.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Plenary Meeting Not Yet Scheduled <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Soong also stated that the date for convening a plenary meeting of the Economic Council has not yet been set. The Standing Committee must carefully study the above-mentioned proposals from various parties and select the projects that should be implemented in advance. Only after determining that it is necessary to convene a plenary meeting for discussion will the date of convening be decided.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Cotton and Wheat Loan Under Negotiation for Amendment <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>When reporters inquired about amending the US cotton and wheat loan agreement, Mr. Soong stated that because domestic cotton and wheat production had been very strong last year, coupled with the low price of cotton yarn, the imported US cotton and wheat were not selling well. Therefore, it was necessary to negotiate an amendment with the US to reduce the amount purchased or transfer the funds to purchase other goods. This is currently being handled by the embassy secretary, Mr. Wei Wenbin, in the US. As for the funds obtained from the sale of US cotton and wheat that have already arrived in Shanghai, they are still deposited in the bank and have not been touched.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Soong Denies Restructuring of the Economic Council <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>There were rumors that the Economic Council would be changed to a chairman system. When reporters asked Mr. Soong about this, he said that there was no such thing as changing the Economic Council to a chairman system, but it was planned to set up a director of operations, to be concurrently held by a member of the Standing Committee. During discussions in Nanjing, several members of the Standing Committee proposed that he concurrently serve as the director of operations, but he felt that the responsibility was heavy and the work was complicated, and he was afraid that he would not be able to handle it, so he did not take the position.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Implementation of the Seven-Province Highway Plan <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Soong continued, "In the past, the Council's funds have mostly been used for highway construction. The Council itself does not use much money. However, the two-year highway construction plan for seven provinces will begin this year, which is the first year. As for the Council's relationship with the various provinces, it is only in the position of providing subsidies and supervision. That is, it allocates funds to subsidize those provinces that meet the Council's highway construction plan standards to promote its implementation and supervises it at any time during the process." Mr. Soong also stated that whether or not to organize the Coal and Cement Control Committee is still under study by the Standing Committee.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Soong Has a Very Good Impression of the Plenary Meeting <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Soong concluded by saying that everyone was able to unite in spirit during this plenary meeting, and he had a very good impression of it. He did not make any proposals himself, but only gave a brief and systematic oral report on the past affairs of the National Economic Council and the negotiations he had conducted overseas.</p>

<p>Minister Zhu Will Come to Shanghai Tonight to Participate</p>
<p>Minister Zhu's Wife Will Perform the Inauguration Ceremony</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Sino-British Direct Telecommunications Link, organized by the International Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, has been fully completed and is scheduled to hold the opening ceremony of the Sino-British Direct Telecommunications Link at the Zhenru International Radio Station at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow. The Minister of Communications, Zhu Jia-hua, is scheduled to come to Shanghai from Nanjing tonight to participate in the ceremony. The inauguration ceremony will be performed by Minister Zhu's wife, Madam Cheng Pei-fang. The details of the preparations and other information are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e112">Minister Zhu Will Come to Shanghai Tonight to Participate <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The opening ceremony is scheduled to be held at the Zhenru International Radio Station at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow. All arrangements have been made. Minister Zhu Jia-hua telegraphed the International Telecommunications Bureau yesterday, saying that he had decided to come to Shanghai to participate in the ceremony. It is also learned that Mr. Zhu has decided to take the night express train from Nanjing to Shanghai tonight with his wife, Madam Cheng Pei-fang. Madam Zhu has also agreed to perform the inauguration ceremony. After the opening ceremony, there will be a tea party at Zhu's residence on Seymour Road at 6:00 p.m.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Two Years of Preparation Fully Completed <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>In view of the increasingly close relationship between China and Britain, and the fact that telecommunications between the two countries relied entirely on foreign merchants, which not only meant the loss of sovereignty but also caused inconvenience, the Ministry of Communications first signed the Sino-British Wireless Telegraphy Agreement with the Imperial International Communications Company in London in June 1932 and signed a contract with the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company in London to purchase Marconi high-power wireless telegraph and telephone transmitting and receiving equipment. In July, the International Telecommunications Bureau was instructed to allocate 100,000 yuan from the deposit of telegraph fees as a guarantee deposit for the contract to purchase equipment from the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company. It then prepared for the implementation of various tasks related to the Sino-British Telecommunications Link and dispatched four trainees to the Marconi Company for practical training in March of last year. The construction of the radio station building began in April, and the first batch of ordered equipment arrived in Shanghai at this time. In May, the construction of the antenna tower and other projects began. As for the foundation stone laying ceremony for the British machines, it was held in June by Minister Zhu himself in Shanghai. The laying of underground cables, the erection of antennas, and the installation of the delivered equipment were all completed at the beginning of last month and trial reports were started. Marconi Company sent engineer Henry to Shanghai to assist with everything.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Total Expenditure of 1.2 Million <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The equipment for the Sino-British Telecommunications Link is a Marconi high-power direct-wave radio telegraph machine. The total price of the transmitting and receiving telephone machines is 742,344.083 yuan, freight and insurance are 18,400 yuan, customs duties are 159,641.621 yuan, the generator is 71,000 yuan, the central transmitting and receiving room equipment is 26,251.023 yuan, the base totals 17,989.043 yuan, the buildings total 48,889.084 yuan, the equipment installation fee totals 64,734.08 yuan, and the underground cables total 105,087.082 yuan, totaling 1,254,349.58 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Both Parties Decide on Telegraph Fee Distribution <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Sino-British Telecommunications Link is scheduled to open tomorrow and begin telecommunications immediately, as the results of the trial reports in recent days have been exceptionally good. As for the telegraph fees collected, they are equal to the prices of foreign merchants. The method of distribution of the telegraph fees collected between China and Britain has also been decided. Two-thirds of the telegraph fees from China to Britain will belong to us, and the rest will belong to Britain. From Britain to China, the opposite is true. For example, if a telegram is sent from Shanghai to London and the price is 100 yuan, then 75 yuan will belong to our side and 25 yuan will belong to the British side.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Telecommunications in Various Places Gradually Expanding <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The Bureau is gradually expanding direct telecommunications with foreign countries. Including the Sino-British link, it has reached eleven locations, including (1) Shanghai-Manila, telecommunications began on January 4, 1929, (2) Shanghai-Hong Kong, telecommunications began on July 1 of the same year, (3) Shanghai-Batavia, telecommunications began on May 7, 1930, (4) Shanghai-San Francisco (jointly operated company radio station), (5) Shanghai-Berlin, (6) Shanghai-Paris, all of which began telecommunications on December 6, 1930, (7) Shanghai-Saigon, telecommunications began on July 1, 1931, (8) Shanghai-Geneva, telecommunications began on February 5, 1932, (9) Shanghai-Moscow, telecommunications began on March 10, 1933, (10) Shanghai-San Francisco (Mackay Company radio station), telecommunications began on May 19, 1933, (11) Shanghai-London, telecommunications scheduled to begin on February 3, 1934.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Chairman of Guangxi Province Huang Xuchu Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Scheduled to Take a Ship to Hong Kong Tomorrow to Return to Guangxi</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Talks About Guangxi Province's Efforts in Construction</p>
<p>Huang Xuchu, a member of the Central Committee and Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Government, came to Shanghai from Guangxi to attend the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee in Nanjing. Having completed his official duties, he arrived in Shanghai by night train from Nanjing at 7:30 yesterday morning and stayed at the Datong Hotel. A reporter from the Xinxin News Agency made a special visit yesterday to inquire about everything. At that time, Mr. Huang was out on official business, so Secretary Chen said that Mr. Huang felt quite tired from attending the Fourth Plenary Session in Nanjing and planned to rest in Shanghai for a day or two and visit friends in Shanghai. He is scheduled to take the Japanese Empress ship of the Changxing Company to Hong Kong on the 3rd of this month to return to Guangxi. As for the details of the Fourth Plenary Session, Mr. Huang was too busy and had not had time to talk about it, but it was reported that the results were quite satisfactory. Mr. Chen continued that in recent years, the construction of Guangxi Province has made some progress, but it has not yet reached perfection. This is because the total annual revenue of Guangxi Province's entire finances is only about 20 million yuan. Fortunately, the expenses of the military and government are very light (the total annual expenditure in the budget is about 10 million). This is because there are very few troops. The total number of provincial troops is currently about 45,000, plus about 7,000 to 8,000 militia, totaling less than 60,000. Moreover, a part of them is still assisting the Central Army in suppressing bandits in Jiangxi, so the supply is still low. Therefore, the Guangxi authorities have used all of the financial revenue except for expenses for construction in recent years. Furthermore, the banditry in Guangxi Province has now been completely eliminated, and the people can live and work in peace.</p>
<h3 id="e118">The Tianchu Aircraft Is Undergoing Assembly <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The Naming Date Is Being Negotiated</p>
<p>The Trainer Aircraft Has Been Transported from Beiping to Shanghai</p>
<p>According to the Xinxin News Agency, the Tianchu MSG Factory, solely invested in purchasing a full-metal fighter plane from the German Junkers factory. After it was transported to Shanghai for assembly, the German pilot hired by the seller had mediocre skills and damaged the propeller oil tank severely during a test flight. After negotiations, the damaged parts were completely replaced. At the same time, the Junkers factory delivered a full-metal trainer aircraft, which they had transported to China for sale, to the Tianchu factory at no cost to compensate for the interest on the paid purchase price. Unexpectedly, the replacement parts were transported from Germany on December 3 of last year. When two technicians dispatched by the Central Aviation Administration were engaged in assembly, they suddenly discovered that another small part had been damaged. They telegraphed the factory to re-manufacture it, which was delayed until now. According to the Xinxin News Agency, the parts have now been transported from Germany and are currently undergoing installation. If there are no other incompatible parts, the assembly will be completed in a few days. As for the trainer aircraft transported from Beiping to Shanghai, the internal motor was once tested and the results were quite good. It is also reported that the fighter plane and the trainer aircraft will be named at the same time. The Tianchu factory plans to donate the fighter plane to the government and the trainer aircraft to the Flying Club established by the Chinese Aviation Association for the purpose of training aviation personnel. The factory is currently negotiating the naming date and address with the Aviation Association.</p>

<h3 id="e122">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to Request That the Salt Weight Be Changed Without Increasing Taxes <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Calculate the Proportion According to the Municipal Weight</p>
<p>Avoid the Policy of Increasing Taxes by Changing the System</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday, saying: "To the Nanjing Ministry of Finance: On the 31st of this month, we received a telegram from the Hankou Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which read: 'To the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, the National Government Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission: Since the Hubei Salt Affairs Inspection Office announced that the salt weight would be changed to the municipal weight and the tax rate would remain the same, the grocery and liquor industries have repeatedly requested that the tax rate be reduced according to the municipal weight to alleviate the people's difficulties. It is true that changing the salt weight to the municipal weight and unifying the measurement rules is necessary for government decrees. However, the new municipal weight system requires 124 catties to be equivalent to 100 catties of the old weight. The tax rate for salt should be calculated and reduced according to the percentage ratio to be fair. Now that the measuring instruments have been updated but the tax rate remains the same, 100 catties of salt under the new weight will have to pay the same tax as 100 catties of the old weight. According to secret calculations, the tax rate for every 100 catties of salt has suddenly increased by more than 24 percent. It is called changing the weight, but in reality, it is increasing the tax. This is probably not the original intention of the government to protect the people. We believe that the Central Committee and Chairman Chiang are doing everything possible to help the rural areas. At a time when the rural areas are bankrupt and the people's livelihood is deteriorating, how can they bear this heavy tax? Moreover, salt is a necessity for the lives of ordinary people, and the sales volume in rural areas is particularly large. The so-called salt tax is actually a poll tax. If the governing officials give a little consideration to this policy of increasing taxes on a per capita basis, they will not be willing to do it. Salt is related to the people's livelihood, and it is not convenient to suppress it. We beg you to look into the situation and allow the weight to be changed without increasing taxes, which will benefit the people without costing anything. We will be grateful beyond measure. We are anxiously awaiting your orders.' The Hankou Municipal Chamber of Commerce kowtows to you." It has been found that changing the salt weight to the municipal weight and secretly increasing taxes is close to deceiving the people and has a profound and significant impact on the people's livelihood. We hope that we can strive for a consistent approach and strive to achieve the goal of changing the weight without increasing taxes. We are anxiously awaiting your orders. We approve of this and find that Hubei salt must use the municipal weight, but the tax rate is still collected according to the old rate, which invisibly increases the burden on salt merchants. The people who are directly affected are still the ordinary people. It is appropriate to report the situation and ask the Ministry to examine and approve it, and to allow the tax amount to be corrected proportionally according to the number converted by the municipal weight, so as to avoid the name of unifying the measurement system and secretly increasing taxes, which is truly fair and convenient. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce kowtows to you.</p>

<p>A Rare New Record in Decades</p>
<p>Bombing Reefs to Save the Emei</p>
<p>The interruption of navigation on the Yangtze River due to shallow water, which hinders the passage of ships up and down the river, has been reported in this newspaper. Unexpectedly, the river level has continued to recede in recent days, and the discovery of an even shallower water level yesterday is a rare occurrence in recent decades. The record is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e124">Water Level Continues to Decrease <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>On Monday and Tuesday of this week, the water level in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River dropped sharply. Between Xiaogushan and Madang, the shortest time it dropped to was nine feet two inches. All ships used barges, resulting in many ships being stopped up and down Madang. Unexpectedly, on Wednesday night, the water level at that location dropped again. After verification by the Jianghan Customs, it dropped another three inches. Since yesterday, the Yangtze River water has been found to have the shallowest record of eight feet nine inches.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Night Navigation Prohibited <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Jianghan Customs issued another notice stating that the water level from Jiujiang up to Hankou is eleven feet and zero inches, while from Jiujiang down to Wuhu, it is only eight feet and nine inches. Effective immediately, the river surface between Madang is not suitable for ships with shallow draft and night navigation is prohibited to avoid danger. The local Nisshin Kisen Kaisha has already suspended the voyage of the "Luoyang Maru" because of its large size and deep draft. They have reassigned the "Zuiyo Maru," which has the shallowest draft, to operate in order to prevent grounding.</p>
<h3 id="e126">The Difficult Rescue of Changxing <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The "Changxing" steamer of the Sanbei Company has been aground at Madang for five days. First, the "Yongkang," "Sanbei," and "Fuyang" steamers were sent to tow it, but all failed to dislodge it. Next, the "Awakened Lion" was dispatched to pull it, but it was also unable to rescue it because it was deeply embedded in the sand and mud. A ship has now been sent to unload the cargo from all the cabins before attempting another rescue. Yesterday, according to a telegram from the owner of the steamer, it is still difficult to free it. There is little hope of pulling it off the shoal within a week.</p>
<h3 id="e127">The Four Hongs Retreat to Hankou <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>In the upper reaches of the Yangtze, the water level at Xindi is the shallowest, having risen from four and a half feet to five and a half feet. However, unexpectedly, the river water there dropped again after Tuesday of this week, receding five inches, leaving only five feet of water. The ships traveling up and down the river, waiting for the water to rise before proceeding, were once again disappointed. Except for smaller ships that could be lightered and towed, the "Hongyuan," "Hongheng," "Hongzhen," and "Hongli," the four ships of Sanbei, fully loaded with salt from Juan, were all blocked at Xindi. Later, they retreated to the Luoshan river surface to anchor. Now, Mr. Song, the general manager of Juan, has personally gone to inspect the area. Fearing bandit activity in the Luoshan area, he agreed with Sanbei to have all the salt on the four Hong ships returned to Hankou for anchorage, awaiting a rise in water before proceeding to Changsha.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Blasting Reefs for the Emei <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's upper Yangtze steamer "Emei" ran aground on a reef at Huatanzi in Fuzhou in July of last year. The entire ship was damaged by the raging torrents of the Sichuan River. Repair costs have already reached 100,000 yuan. Now, with the water in the upper Yangtze greatly receding, the "Emei" is even more aground on the rocks along the bank, at a distance of several dozen feet from the surface of the Sichuan River. Taking advantage of this excellent opportunity, the China Merchants Bureau decided to use explosives to blast all the reefs under the ship's hull, destroying the rocks and moving the ship's hull downward. Once the spring waters rise, it can be towed away. This matter has been telegraphed to Ouyang Baida, the director of the Yichang branch, who is responsible for handling it. A total of 5,000 yuan will be spent. The explosives have been transported there. Yesterday, a telegram was received from Yichang stating that the blasting of the reefs had begun. It is estimated that within a week, all the reefs under the ship's hull can be blasted away.</p>

Now, Shi Dengfu leads over a hundred unemployed workers from the rice industry docks, claiming to be unemployed, and petitions for relief. After separate registration and compilation of a roster, a copy is hereby forwarded to you for compliance. Please promptly investigate and ascertain whether these workers are indeed workers who have worked at the rice industry docks along the Wusong River and submit a factual report within three days of receiving this document for verification and handling.

While the meeting was in progress, four police officers from the First District Police Station suddenly arrested Wang Gensheng, a worker from the Shengyuan Pig Farm. Upon hearing the news, the workers were outraged and immediately convened an emergency meeting. After discussion, they appointed Shen Gengchun, Bao Fuxiang, Wang Tongxing, Wang Ayin, and others to submit a petition to the Municipal Party Headquarters, requesting a joint bail. As a result, a representative from the Civil Training Section received them and agreed to find a way to arrange bail.</p>

<p>According to a reporter from the Ren News Agency on the 25th, the Eurasia Aviation Corporation has recently opened a new Guangdong-Shaanxi line to develop business in the Northwest. The company authorities plan to officially launch it on the 5th of this month. Because the Guangdong-Hankou section has already been successfully test flown, and the Hankou-Xi'an section is familiar, no test flight is needed. The schedule is temporarily set to fly once a week between Guangdong and Hankou. The stations along the route are Guangzhou, Changsha, Hankou, Xiangyang, Zhengzhou, and Xi'an. The passenger and airmail fares have not yet been announced and are still being drafted.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Match Manufacturers Request Relief <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The match manufacturers in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces feel that the sudden increase in heavy taxes by the Ministry of Finance is too difficult to bear. Therefore, they have been meeting in Shanghai for several days to discuss relief measures. Those who attended included Gao Songfu and Dong Junchen, representatives from the Shanghai Dahua Factory; Sun Runzhai and Shen Qixiang, representatives from the China Factory; Xu Jingzhi and Hu Zenan, representatives from the Ningbo Zhengda Factory; Xu Guangji, a representative from the Linhuai Huaishang Factory; Yao Baozhen, a representative from the Wenzhou Suichang Factory; Chen Chaozhong, a representative from the Nantong Tongsui Factory; Shao Xiushan, a representative from the Shanghai Daming Factory; and Cai Keming, a representative from the Shanghai Huaming Factory, totaling more than twenty people. After two days of meetings, they decided to organize the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Match Industry Advancement Association, with a preparatory office located at No. 3, Alley 10, Intersection of Fuzhou Road and Shanxi Road in Shanghai. Gao Songfu, Sun Runzhai, and seven others were elected as preparatory members. They also decided that the manufacturers from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui would jointly petition the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, and the Executive Yuan, the Central Party Headquarters, and other agencies, requesting a reduction in taxes and measures for relief. The petition listed the various hardships suffered by the factories and four methods of seeking relief. The main point was that after the sudden increase in heavy taxes, including the original tax amount, it accounts for about 70% of the cost of goods. The economic burden is difficult to bear, the use of capital is even more insufficient, there are too many old labels, new goods are difficult to sell, and the work in each factory will inevitably be suspended, with workers facing unemployment. Therefore, they requested a reduction in tax rates, a limited sale of old labels, restrictions on the establishment of factories, and incentives for artificial manufacturing, etc., in order to provide relief and maintain them. It is reported that, in addition to submitting written petitions to the party and government agencies, the manufacturers are also seeking solidarity and mutual assistance, aiming to cooperate and actively preparing for the advancement association. They also support the National Match Industry Joint Association as the national leader.</p>

<p>The Tragic Disaster of Ice Jams on the Yellow River</p>
<p>The World Red Swastika Society previously dispatched relief team leader Yu Yuanguan to Changyuan to distribute winter relief. A letter has now been received from Changyuan reporting that the county is currently suffering another major calamity due to ice jams on the Yellow River. Over thirty villages along both banks of the river have been washed away by the water. The depth of the water is over ten feet in some places and several feet in others. Countless people and animals have frozen to death. The situation is extremely serious, and relief efforts are also difficult. In addition to the team actively working hard to rescue the victims, the original letter is copied below, hoping that philanthropists at home and abroad will provide more assistance. This is a report of the matter. Investigations revealed that the breaches on both the east and west banks of the Yellow River last year were both within Changyuan County. The severity of the disaster was the worst among the counties in other provinces. Currently, the national and provincial governments and various charitable organizations have provided multiple emergency and winter relief efforts, and the villagers have gradually returned home to build earthen shelters and temporary dwellings. Unexpectedly, due to the excessive ice jams in Hua County, ice water overflowed suddenly on the evening of January 13th, flowing from north to south and horizontally breaching the villages along the new river channel, including Zhangzhuang, Sanniangzhai, Fangliji, Dasuzhuang, Xiaosuzhuang, Zhaituan, Sanguanmiao, Sulu Village, Dongdenggang, Wangzhuang, Lizhai, Getang, Yuanzhai, Liuzhuang, Zhaizhai, Xingzhai, Zhaozhai, Leidian, Tianzhuang, Cuizhai, Yangzhai, various Shitouzhai, Zhihuzhai, Lizhuang, Dalizhai, Chenzhai, Xiasai, Guosai, Lizhai, Sunlou, and Jiujiji, totaling thirty-eight villages. Even the Iron Furnace Village of Zhishi, which resisted bandits led by Ji Qi, was broken open by the ice, with water depths of over ten feet in some places and several feet in others. Those who could not escape in time, without boats or vehicles to cross the ice, had their toes broken and skin torn. Those clinging to buildings and trees were pierced by the cold wind. Cries for help could be heard for several miles. Countless houses were submerged and collapsed, and countless people and animals froze, starved, and drowned. The severity of the disaster is ten times worse than the breaches in autumn and summer. Currently, team members are actively rescuing the victims. Those who have been rescued from the water are given relief food. Efforts are also being made to rescue those still in the water, etc.</p>

<p>The Chinese National Cotton Cloth Market on Guizhou Road in Shanghai was initiated by Zhang Zilian and others. After the reorganization, Du Yuesheng became the chairman and Zhang Rongchu became the general manager. The subscribed capital of 250,000 yuan has been fully paid, and business has begun. Buying machine-woven cloth with cash during this crucial period of year-end settlement for the business community is especially beneficial to small industrial and commercial enterprises. It is reported that the market plans to provide pure domestic yarn to machine weavers in the future. The market will purchase the woven cloth and then sell it. This will not only facilitate the control of the products but also eliminate enemy goods from the Shanghai market, and the lives of more than 1,000 machine weaving families and 20,000 workers can be stabilized. Zhang Zilian, the original initiator, is currently the chairman of the market's Production Guidance Committee. He recently published a letter to all machine weavers, offering sincere advice and encouragement to each weaver.</p>

<p>Effective Today</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Business Office of the Two Railways, in order to facilitate merchants, specially signed thirteen provisional measures with the Taiping Moving Company for the receiving and delivery of goods, which were submitted to the railway bureau for approval and implementation. As the measures were not comprehensive enough and the set rates for receiving and delivery were also considered slightly high, the business office further negotiated with the company to appropriately reduce the receiving and delivery fees and added five additional articles, all of which will be implemented starting today. The original text of the additional articles is as follows: (1) For each household whose goods weigh less than one metric ton, the business office will handle the receiving and delivery itself. Only for goods weighing one metric ton or more will the company be entrusted to dispatch a vehicle for receiving and delivery. (2) The company agrees to revise the freight receiving and delivery fees as follows: First and second class freight: 25 cents of silver per 100 kilograms (originally 30 cents); Third and fourth class freight: 20 cents of silver per 100 kilograms (originally 25 cents); Fifth and sixth class freight: 15 cents of silver per 100 kilograms (originally 20 cents). The above weight will still be calculated based on the railway's chargeable weight, with no minimum weight requirement. (3) For the delivery of soap from the China Soap Company by vehicle, a receiving fee of one yuan and five jiao of silver per ton will be charged, and the company will be paid at a 95% discount. (4) The fees for receiving and delivering coffins or empty caskets are as follows: One item: 6 yuan; Two items: 8 yuan; Three items: 10.5 yuan; Four items: 12 yuan; Five items: 14 yuan; Six items: 15 yuan (originally a flat rate of 6 yuan per item). The above receiving and delivery fees will be paid to the company at a 90% discount. (5) All provisions in the provisional measures that do not conflict with this annex remain valid.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Annual Work Report of the Shanghai Municipal Police <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Cars Increased by 42% in Five Years</p>
<p>Six Kidnapping Cases Occurred in the Concession This Year</p>
<p>Major Jarrad, Commissioner of the Shanghai Municipal Police, reported on the past year's work, stating that there were a total of 32 encounters between patrolling police and armed bandits during the year, resulting in one police officer killed and eight injured. Eleven bandits were killed and thirteen injured. The discipline and integrity of all police personnel were excellent. The General Reserve Unit and Special Police were also extremely effective.</p>
<p>Traffic Problems: The increasing number of vehicles of all kinds has made it increasingly difficult for the police to manage traffic. The number of cars alone has increased by 42% in five years. The narrow streets and the parking of vehicles often obstruct traffic. The situation has improved since the opening of the Race Course Road, but the road has not been fully utilized. The one-way traffic rule has been implemented on Hong Kong Road and Sichuan Road with good results. Traffic lights have been installed at 68 intersections, and there are plans to test an electric lighting system in the future. The motorcycle patrol team has been quite effective. A total of 53,034 traffic violations were recorded this year, of which 8,495 were prosecuted (7,845 Chinese and 650 foreigners). 16,249 car drivers were registered. 386 people were prosecuted for honking excessively. There are 107 electric trams and 107 trailer cars. The total number of passengers for the year was 119,669,536. There are 164 buses and 1,656 freight cars. Four vehicles were scrapped due to damage, and 173 licenses were revoked due to damage. There are currently 47 taxi companies with 44 more taxis. Licenses were revoked for 19 vehicles due to unsanitary conditions. There are currently 9,990 licensed public rickshaws, which are inspected every two months. 26,571 cases of rickshaw pullers being prosecuted for violations in the Central and Old Zha districts were recorded. The average number of licenses issued for private rickshaws per quarter was 12,579, an increase of 1,321 from the previous year. Strict measures have been taken to crack down on the unauthorized soliciting of passengers, which has been greatly reduced. 29,242 bicycles were registered, with an average of 13,242 flatbed carts and 8,841 handcarts. These heavy vehicles are still able to compete with cars due to their low cost. There are currently 32 horse-drawn carriage companies with 100 carriages. They are rarely used except for weddings and funerals.</p>
<p>Traffic Accidents: Statistics for the past five years are as follows: 9,691 cases in 1929, with 3,447 injuries and 141 deaths; 10,973 cases in 1930, with 4,005 injuries and 142 deaths; 12,948 cases in 1931, with 4,570 injuries and 143 deaths; 12,016 cases in 1932, with 4,250 injuries and 134 deaths; 13,571 cases in 1933, with 4,495 injuries and 107 deaths. Although the number of cases has increased, the number of deaths has decreased. The ages of the deceased last year were: 2 were under 5 years old, 31 were between 5 and 15 years old, 50 were between 15 and 40 years old, and 24 were over 40 years old. The number of cars in the concession last year was 5,756 private cars, 1,013 public cars, 1,656 freight cars, 162 buses, and 717 motorcycles. In addition, 63 commercial licenses were issued.</p>
<p>Communication Methods: The police department implemented a centralized traffic agency, which has proven to be effective. Recently, teleprinters have been added for further convenience. The headquarters' radio broadcasting has been quite effective. However, the radio patrol cars need to be replaced with new ones.</p>
<p>Number of Crimes: According to the report, there were 1 case this year, and there were 4,927 unsolved cases at the end of the year. 24,513 criminals were arrested this year. Excluding those who have been released and those who are still in custody, 22,412 were convicted by the court after trial.</p>
<p>Kidnapping Cases: There were six kidnapping cases this year and two attempted kidnappings (eleven kidnapping cases in 1932, with three attempted; seventeen kidnapping cases in 1931, with eight attempted; thirty-three kidnapping cases in 1930, with three attempted). Two hostages were rescued by police in the concession, two were redeemed by themselves, and the whereabouts of the other two hostages are still unknown. One hostage was hidden in this concession, two were hidden in the French Concession, one was hidden in the Chinese territory, and the whereabouts of the other two are unknown. Five of the six cases involved cars. Two were cars owned by the car owner, and three were cars prepared by the kidnappers themselves. 128 cases of receiving threatening letters were recorded this year (174 cases in 1932, 183 cases in 1931, and 228 cases in 1930). As a result, 40 people were arrested, and 34 have been sentenced.</p>
<p>Property Theft: There were 443 armed robbery cases (504 cases last year, 529 cases the year before, and 702 cases the year before that). There were 105 other robbery cases.

It was found that embezzled and fraudulent property accounted for 433,157 yuan, accounting for over 33%, which can be regarded as something that the police cannot prevent.</p>

<p>Li Had Only Succeeded to the Position of General Manager for Just Over a Year</p>
<p>Last Night He Was on the Third Floor of the Hotel, About to Take a Bath</p>
<p>The Assailant Took Advantage of the Opportunity to Break in and Shot Li Twice</p>
<p>Li Died Immediately, and the Police Dispatched Detectives to Investigate</p>
<p>｜The Assailant Was Zhou Zhanyuan, the Head of the Gatekeepers of the New-New Company｜</p>
<p>Li Minzhou, the general manager of the New-New Department Store on Nanjing Road and Guizhou Road, was shot and killed by Zhou Zhanyuan, the head of the gatekeepers, at 6:30 PM yesterday in the general manager's office on the third floor of the New-New Hotel. The bullets hit vital points, causing his immediate death. The details are recorded below. He succeeded as general manager when the New-New Company reached its eighth-anniversary celebration. When Liu Xiji was the general manager, Li Minzhou was the manager. After Liu passed away due to illness, Li was elected as general manager by the board of directors and had been in the position for over a year. He was extremely capable and had a great work ethic.</p>
<p>Removing Clothes to Bathe</p>
<p>Yesterday at approximately 6:30 PM, after finishing his work in the company office, Li walked into the general manager's office, room 327 on the third floor of the New-New Hotel. He took off his outer robe and had just leaned against the sofa when Guan Yizhang (age 28, Cantonese), a servant from room 37, entered to serve him. Li then instructed Guan Yizhang to go to the inner bathroom to run water. As Li was taking off his shoes and socks on the sofa, the assailant took advantage of the opportunity to break in.</p>
<p>Two Shots Struck Him</p>
<p>Suddenly, a robust man, Zhou Zhanyuan from Tianjin, wearing the uniform of the company's gatekeepers, barged into the room. Without saying a word, he raised his gun and shot Li twice. One bullet hit near the left breast, piercing through the back, and the other hit the left waist, but did not exit. Seeing that his goal had been achieved, the assailant fled the room and rushed down the stairs. At that moment, Li cried out for help. Guan Yizhang, the servant in the bathroom, heard the gunshots followed by Li's groans. He rushed out and helped Li to the residence of his relative, a Mr. Chen, in room 305. However, Li was severely wounded and collapsed by the bed, dying soon after.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the bad news, the tea room staff on the third floor immediately notified the accounting room below by telephone and quickly closed the main gate to pursue the assailant. They also reported to the Laozha Police Station, and the police chief immediately dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives, armed, to search for him. Unfortunately, the assailant had already vanished. Shortly after, an ambulance arrived and rushed Li to Renji Hospital. Doctors performed surgery and administered strong heart stimulants, but Li's injuries were too severe, and he died within ten minutes.</p>
<p>The Assailant Arrested</p>
<p>When the detectives investigated, they found a bullet on the sofa in room 327, which they took to the police station as evidence. It is said that the police are taking this case very seriously. After the incident, they ordered Chinese and foreign detectives to search for the assailant everywhere. At around 10:00 PM, the detectives captured the suspect and detained him at the police station. This morning, he was sent to the court for investigation.</p>

<p>Li Minzhou was from Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, and was 53 years old. He had some assets and lived in a Western-style house at 202 Bazi Road. His wife, Gao, was over 40 years old, and they had four children. The eldest son, Renru, was 17 years old and studied at the Guangdong Public School in Zhabei.</p>

<p>The assailant, Zhou Zhanyuan, was from Tianjin and was 45 years old. He was hired from the north as a gatekeeper when the New-New Company opened. Because he was diligent in his duties, he was later promoted to head of the gatekeepers, a position he had held for several years. Recently, the company authorities, considering the position of head of the gatekeepers to be unimportant, dismissed him just yesterday. Zhou, having suffered this unexpected blow and facing an uncertain future, expressed dissatisfaction with the general manager and resolutely took this drastic action, going to assassinate him.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Massive Fraud Case at the Banque de l'Indochine Involving Chinese, English, Italian, and Russian Individuals <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>English and Italian Perpetrators Handed Over to Their Respective Consulates</p>
<p>Chinese and Russian Perpetrators Interrogated Yesterday by the Special Court No. 1</p>
<p>Ten Chinese and Foreign Individuals Appeared in Court to Testify</p>
<p>British Consulate Police Court Summoned Englishman Mark Yesterday</p>
<p>Following the revelation of a massive fraud at the Banque de l'Indochine, involving a sum of 136,818.50 yuan, the Public Concession Police Department launched an investigation, gradually apprehending over ten suspects of Chinese, English, Italian, and Russian nationalities. Except for the English and Italian perpetrators, who enjoyed consular jurisdiction and were handed over to their respective consulates for investigation, the two Russian nationals, Joussoupov Aharonovich Smaransky and Tzein, and the two Chinese nationals, Wang Chunggan (aka Wang Haoran) and Xie Pingfeng, were prosecuted by the Shanghai Municipal Council's lawyers, Ru Bao-yi and Li Zhi-shan, on charges of fraud, forgery, counterfeiting documents, and using forged documents, etc., at the First Special District Court, which was reported in the newspapers.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Judge Qian Hongye of the Criminal Division No. 1 specially convened a hearing, ordering the four defendants to be brought before the court for interrogation. Many Russian expatriates in Shanghai attended the hearing. The two Russian defendants were defended by Lawyer Phipps, Wang Chunggan was defended by Lawyer Mao Xianshen, and Lawyers Zhang Chongding, Fan Gang, and Wang Jian represented Xie Pingfeng.</p>
<p>First, SMC Lawyer Ru Bao-yi gave a detailed account of the police's investigation process and the legal basis for the prosecution, explaining the fraudulent scheme of forging fake checks from the British American Tobacco Company and using the Guohua Bank to cash them at the Banque de l'Indochine for over 130,000 yuan, which was the same as previously reported. Therefore, we will not repeat it here. However, how this huge sum was divided is still unknown to the outside world. According to Lawyer Ru, based on the police investigation, and limited to the four defendants on trial at the Special Court, the first defendant, Joussoupov Aharonovich, received 44,000 yuan, the second defendant received 4,500 yuan, and the fourth defendant received 5,500 yuan. The exact amount received by the third defendant is still unclear.</p>
<p>Lawyer Ru continued to explain the method used by the group to steal checks that had already been cashed by the British American Tobacco Company from the Banque de l'Indochine in order to forge the fake checks. The second defendant, Wang Chunggan, was an employee of the Banque de l'Indochine. He, at the request of the first defendant, stole two checks that had already been cashed by the British American Tobacco Company from the vault and handed them over to the first defendant. The first defendant then instructed the third defendant to have the checks photographed and a copper plate made. The printing was then done, and a sum of over 130,000 yuan was filled in, falsely claiming it was paid to the China Tobacco Leaf Company. There is no such company in Shanghai, but there are such companies in the North and Qingdao. After the name of the company was created, a mailbox was rented at the post office to receive any correspondence.</p>
<p>After the Banque de l'Indochine cashed the check, the forged check was originally to be kept, but it was unexpectedly torn up, leaving only a corner. It was exactly the same as the second forged check for over 180,000 yuan created by the group. Thus, the format of the first check could be imagined from the color and shape of the second fake check. Lawyer Ru concluded by stating that the Englishman Mark, who guaranteed the opening of accounts at Guohua Bank and other banks in the names of the defendants, had already been prosecuted by the Shanghai Municipal Council at the British Consulate. In addition, an accomplice, a Russian man with a missing finger, has been apprehended in Tianjin and will soon be escorted to Shanghai for trial.</p>
<p>Judge Qian then began to question the witnesses. A total of ten people appeared in court to testify. They were two employees of the British American Tobacco Company, Englishman Wilbur and Cowdery, who testified that the checks issued by the British American Tobacco Company required their signatures and that the signatures on the forged checks were not theirs. They also said that the fake checks were so accurately imitated that it was difficult to distinguish the genuine from the fake at first glance. Next was an Englishman, an accountant at the Banque de l'Indochine, who testified about the discovery of the fake checks, stating that the British American Tobacco Company checks were issued by the bank. Because the numbers on the fake checks did not match, it was known that they were fake. According to regulations, all checks that have been paid are stored in a room, and all bank employees have free access to the room. Wang Chunggan, as a bank employee, could also enter the room.</p>
<p>The fourth witness was Russian, Coxinin, who testified about the first defendant opening an account at Guohua Bank and Shanghai Bank in the name of the China Tobacco Leaf Company. He said that he had known the first defendant for six years and that opening accounts at both banks was entrusted to him. First, the application form was filled out, and the first defendant asked Mark to guarantee it, and the seal of Chinese Li Wenzhun was affixed to the application form, and submitted to the two banks for approval. After the approval, the first defendant deposited 1,050 yuan in cash to the Shanghai Bank through him, and 700-800 yuan by check and 100 yuan in cash to the Guohua Bank, all in the name of China Tobacco Leaf Company.</p>
<p>The witness following Coxinin was also a Russian photographer, Lefjevski, who claimed that in July or August of last year, the first defendant ordered him to photograph two checks from the British American Tobacco Company to the Banque de l'Indochine, without specifying the purpose. However, he was instructed to keep it a secret. Between January 17 and 18 of this year, when he went to Mark's company to collect money from the first defendant, he saw a check for over 180,000 yuan, and Mark was affixing Li Wenzhun's seal on the back of the check.</p>
<p>The testimony of the witness was quite different from his statement at the police station, but he admitted in court that the statement presented by the police was in his handwriting. After that, two Japanese photographers and printers testified one after another. One specially certified that the copper plate was made for a Russian with a missing finger (the one arrested in Tianjin), and the other specially certified that after the copper plate was made, the Japanese photographer accompanied the Russian with a missing finger to the printing factory he had set up on Zhapu Road, where the Russian with a missing finger took out the copper plate and the paper he had brought and ordered him to print the copper plate on the paper, and the Russian with a missing finger took it away after printing.</p>
<p>At this point, Lawyer Ru stood up and stated that before asking the Japanese to make the plate and print, the group had asked the Da Zhonghua Printing Factory to undertake this work, but because the factory's technology was not good, it was abandoned even after the work was completed, so they turned to the Japanese for it. So, Chen, the director of Da Zhonghua, came to court to testify about the circumstances of the first and third defendants, Russian, coming to the factory to make plates and print. Also, Russian Fantaulof testified that the first defendant asked him to rent a mailbox at the post office on his behalf. Finally, two employees, Jiang and Xia, of the Huamei Engraving Shop testified about the facts that the first and third defendants came to the shop to order the printing of stationery and envelopes for the China Tobacco Leaf Company and the engraving of rubber stamps.</p>
<p>After more than five hours of testimony, the court adjourned and announced that the hearing would be continued on another day. The four defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<p>Interrogation of Mark: The North-China Daily News reports that Englishman Mark, accused of conspiring with Russian Ivanov and others to use fake checks to defraud the Banque de l'Indochine of 136,688.25 yuan, was further tried in the British Consulate Police Court yesterday. The prosecuting attorney, McLair, stated that he was not prepared to proceed with the case at this time because the important evidence was all in the First Special District Court, used to try Ivanov. If Ivanov is innocent, the case can be completed in one or two days, so please extend the hearing.</p>
<p>Next, the defendant's lawyer, Harup, requested bail on behalf of the defendant, saying that the previous application was not approved because it was feared that the release of the person concerned would hinder the police's investigation. Now that the police investigation has been completed, there is no need to worry about this. The presiding judge then ordered the defendant to provide bail of 2,500 yuan, and two more Englishmen to each guarantee 2,500 yuan for his release. The defendant's passport should be temporarily deposited with the registry. The next hearing is scheduled for 10:30 AM on February 9.</p>

<p>Shoots Himself in the Heart with a Pistol</p>
<p>Seriously Wounded, Life in Danger</p>
<p>At the Yangtze Hotel on Sanma Road at about 10 AM yesterday, a Russian teenager suddenly came with a pistol at his waist and went to room 722 on the seventh floor of the hotel. He paid 3.80 yuan for the room, gave 4 yuan, and asked the tea room attendant to get envelopes and stationery, wrote a letter in Western language, and instructed the tea room attendant to send it immediately to his office at the China Business Company on Sichuan Road, Sanma Road. After speaking, the Russian teenager raised his own pistol and fired a shot at his chest. The bullet entered his heart, blood flowed profusely, and he collapsed to the ground. The tea room attendant, seeing this, was terrified and dumbfounded. After regaining his senses, he reported to the accounting room, who then reported to the Laozha Police Station, which sent an ambulance to rush the Russian teenager to the hospital for treatment. It is said that the injury is serious, and his life is in danger.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Truth Revealed About the Tragic Death of an Apprentice at the Shanghai Municipal Council Hygiene Department's Laboratory <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The Injury Behind the Head Was Definitely Sustained While Alive</p>
<p>Death Was Caused by Taking Poison After the Injury</p>
<p>Shi Shaoxing, an apprentice at Xu Futai Western Clothing Store on Dalianwan Road, died under unclear circumstances. Prosecutor Guo of the First Special District Court had ordered the injured part of the deceased's back of the head to be sent to a doctor for a chemical test to determine the cause of death, pending his report for verification. Shi Qixiang, the uncle of the deceased, believed that he was killed by the shop owner, Xu Futai, and his wife, Xu Chen. He had retained Lawyer Wu Peng to file a criminal complaint against the Xu couple for cruel murder. The court had also summoned them once. The details have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper.</p>
<p>It is now known that after the Special Court handed over the injured limbs of the deceased to the Shanghai Municipal Council's Hygiene Department, a Western doctor with experience at the department conducted a thorough chemical test using various techniques. It was confirmed that the injury behind the head was definitely sustained while alive, but the extent of the injury was not fatal. Therefore, the cause of death was further studied. As a result of the examination, it was determined that after being injured, the deceased had taken poison similar to opium, resulting in his death. The details of the chemical test and the results obtained were written in a detailed report and submitted to the court for verification.</p>
<p>This chaotic murder case, which lasted for two weeks, finally revealed the cause of death. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Guo announced the report at the autopsy site. Lawyer Wu Peng, the representative of the deceased's family, was also present. The defendants, Xu Futai and his wife, were both summoned but did not arrive. Xu himself had requested to surrender for interrogation after being accused. It is now heard that he has retained Lawyer Chen Tingrui to act as his defense. Presumably, when the Special Court opens this case, the defendant will appear in court with his lawyer.</p>

<p>Chen Songhe Encountered an Accident While Saying Goodbye</p>
<p>A Pistol and Bullets Were Stuffed into His Bed</p>
<p>Resulting in Paying 700 Yuan to Buy His Way Out</p>
<p>Chen Took the Original Steamer Back to Shanghai to Report to the Police</p>
<p>Chen Songhe, a native of Ningbo, currently 39 years old, residing at 1002 Broadway Road, East Head of the Public Concession, owns and operates a Maolin Hardware and Sail Shop, possesses some assets, and uses a car for transportation. He is friendly with Shen Zihuai, a fellow villager residing at No. 8 Ningfu Lane, Grek Road, French Concession. On the afternoon of the 27th of last month, Chen planned to return to his hometown on the New Jiangtian Steamer. He first drove his own car to Shen Zihuai's home at 3 o'clock to say goodbye, and then went to the pier to depart.</p>
<p>Chen arrived at Shen's house and talked for about thirty minutes. Hu Quanhai (age 40, residing at No. 7 Huabao Lane, Huanghe Road, French Concession, a few hundred steps away from Shen Zihuai's residence), a fellow villager known to Chen, led three accomplices (unknown to Chen) into Shen Zihuai's home, claiming to search for red pills. They dragged Chen, Shen, and Shen's family from the living room to the room behind the living room, pretending to search everywhere. The group took the opportunity to stuff a pistol and a box of bullets containing about a hundred bullets into the bed. At that time, Chen was standing next to the bed, so they pretended to find the gun and bullets, and asked Chen where he got this prohibited military material. Chen was dumbfounded and could not answer.</p>
<p>At this time, an accomplice who came with Hu, claiming to be surnamed Jiang, spoke with a Northern accent, drew a pistol and threatened him, forbidding him to publicize. Another man, claiming to be surnamed Wang, reached out and handcuffed Chen's hands. Hu and others then began to negotiate, saying that extorting money could resolve the matter and make it go away. The man surnamed Jiang asked Shen Zihuai's wife if she knew old friends, and asked if she knew Jin Tingsheng. Shen's wife replied that she did not know him. Jiang then mentioned Bao Songqing (age 50, a native of Ningbo, residing at No. 5 Yong'an Lane, Beir Road, French Concession), asking if she knew him. She replied that she knew him slightly, so someone was sent to invite Bao over to negotiate extortion with Chen Songhe.</p>
<p>While threatening him with words, after some deliberation, Chen, because he was anxious to return to his hometown and was threatened, had no choice but to agree to pay 700 yuan to settle the crime of privately possessing military material. After the two parties reached an agreement, they forced Chen to sign a check for 700 yuan payable immediately from Hengli Bank before Chen's handcuffs were removed. The man surnamed Jiang escorted Chen in Chen's car to Hengli Bank to withdraw cash, and then they returned to Shen's home together. After the money was handed over to Bao Songqing, Jiang escorted Chen to the New Jiangtian Steamer. When he arrived at the pier, the steamer was already raising anchor and leaving, so Jiang sent Chen onto the steamer, watched the steamer leave the dock and sail out, and then ordered the driver in Chen's car to drive to the front of the French Concession Xiafei Road, Songshan Road Police Station. Jiang told the driver, "I am a special detective here." After saying that, he left.</p>
<p>The driver then drove the car back to the owner's house and told the mistress what happened to the owner. But when Chen Songhe boarded the ship, the ship had already sailed, and he could not disembark, so he had to go to Ningbo on the steamer and then return to Shanghai on the original steamer to report to the French Concession Police Station, requesting an investigation. The police chief sent detectives to investigate and only arrested Bao Songqing. The others, such as Hu Quanhai and his three accomplices, had heard the news and fled, and could not be arrested. Bao was taken to the police station and sent to the Criminal Division No. 1 of the Second Special District Court yesterday morning. Judge Wang Gangxu conducted the trial. The police lawyer, Gu Shouxi, stated the case, briefly stating that the defendant was arrested for the crime of extortion and fraud. Because the police have not yet investigated and the accomplices are still at large, he requested a postponement, and temporarily detain the defendant, pending investigation of the details of the case and the arrest of the accomplices, and requested a trial.</p>
<p>Next, the plaintiff Chen Songhe testified about the defendant's extortion. After briefly questioning Bao Songqing, the court ordered a postponement of the hearing to February 5. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Both Criminal Law and Regulations Violated: Evil Pimp Forces Good Women into Prostitution <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Ye Jinfeng Was Induced to Come to Shanghai and Sold into a Brothel</p>
<p>Tang Chen Constantly Uses Her Power to Force Women to Work</p>
<p>Ye Jinfeng, a woman from Liyang, is 22 years old and not yet married. She had an affair with Tang Dafu (also known as Fugeng) from her hometown. On the seventh day of the fifth lunar month of last year, she was brought to Shanghai by Tang and forced into the brothel opened by Tang Chen, a Jiangbei woman, at No. 4 Jinyu Lane, Zhujia Bridge, French Concession, as a prostitute. At that time, a contract was signed for a term of four years, with an annual deposit of 53 yuan. Tang took 110 yuan in advance, and the rest would be paid after she completed her term. However, the woman was only told that it would be for a term of one year. The woman was illiterate and was deceived into signing the deposit contract.</p>
<p>When the one-year term expired, the woman wanted to leave the brothel and return home, but the madam refused to let her go. She did not specify a term and used her power. The woman was alone in Shanghai, helpless, and had to endure the pain. Now, half a year has passed. Recently, the woman could not bear the physical pain and vowed to escape the misery, so she took the opportunity to escape a few days ago and reported to the French Concession Police Station, requesting assistance. Detective Qin Youyu, dispatched by the police chief, investigated and found that the madam Tang Chen not only forced good women into prostitution, but also opened a brothel without obtaining a license from the Shanghai Municipal Council, which violated both criminal law and regulations. She was arrested and reported to the police chief, and taken into custody.</p>
<p>Yesterday, she was sent to the Second Special District Court, where Judge Wu Fanglian conducted the trial. The police lawyer prosecuted Tang Chen for offenses against morality and freedom. After questioning the defendants in court, Tang Chen admitted that she had taken in Ye Jinfeng as a prostitute without obtaining a license. The judge then declared the debate closed, and the defendants were remanded in custody. The sentence is scheduled to be pronounced in three days.</p>

<p>The Number 04 Exchange Connecting Pudong Will Be Completed on the 20th</p>
<p>Thirty Cross-Border Machines in Zhabei and Other Areas Have Been Removed</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation negotiated with the Shanghai Telephone Company to recover the cross-border telephone lines, it could have been realized earlier. However, the telephone company's Number 02 manual exchange connecting the Chinese area was quite busy. If it was split off and still connected by the Number 02 manual exchange, it would be even more difficult to cope with. Therefore, the company added a Number 04 manual exchange on the 20th of last month, specifically for connecting the Concession area to Pudong. It is scheduled to be completed on the 20th of this month. All 78 cross-border telephone machines in Pudong this month can be transferred to the telephone bureau for management.</p>
<p>As for the 210 cross-border machines in other areas such as Longhua, Zhenru, Zhabei, Nanshi, and Huxi, in addition to the 30 machines that have been removed by the telephone bureau, the remaining 180 machines must wait until the telephone bureau increases the number of doors on the Number 0 manual exchange in May before they can be removed. The telephone company will also increase the connection equipment to facilitate Chinese and Concession area users to make calls, so as not to wait for a long time.</p>

On the 23rd of last month, at 7:45 PM, he was kidnapped again by bandits at Guangxi Road and Shantou Road, who demanded a huge ransom. After Chief Detective You A'gen of the Old Zha Capture Station rescued Fan from No. 10 Shun'an Lane, West Avenue, and arrested the kidnappers Liu Ziyu, Chou Yulou, and Cui Yaowen, they were handed over to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Details have been published in this newspaper. However, since Fan was kidnapped, the Old Zha Capture Station immediately dispatched Detective Cui Jinchuan and others to guard Fan's house. On the 24th, at 9:45 AM, Fan's house suddenly received a phone call, which was answered by Detective Cui. The caller claimed to be a member of the French Concession police, inquiring whether there was any news about Fan's kidnapping. Detective Cui replied that there was no news. Then the person suddenly changed his tone, saying, "I am actually the leader of the kidnappers. Is your side sincere in negotiating? How much money can you offer?" The detective replied that they were willing to negotiate, but they could not raise a huge sum of money. If it were 5,000 yuan, they could barely manage. However, the other party did not agree, saying that at least 10,000 yuan was required. The detective agreed to try his best and asked to arrange a meeting place and a signal for the person who would come. The other party initially suggested the China Hotel, then the New Guangda Theater, and finally decided on the intersection of Beijing Road and Zhifu Road, in front of the Sino-French Pharmacy, at 2:00 PM.</p>
<p>The person who would come would be wearing a black velvet hat, a long gray cloth gown, a gray scarf, and holding a newspaper. Detective Cui agreed as arranged and reported to the Capture Station. Chief Detective Zhang Yuanqing disguised himself as Fan's representative and waited at the agreed location. Indeed, the person described in the phone call came forward. Before he could speak to Detective Zhang, he was arrested and taken back to the Capture Station. Upon questioning, his name was Hou Wenqin, a native of Shanghai, 20 years old. According to Hou's confession, he had no involvement in the kidnapping incident. He only saw the news about Fan's kidnapping in the newspaper and took advantage of the opportunity to extort money. Because he did not know the phone number, he inquired with the phone company and then called Fan's house from the Shanghai Bank on Ningbo Road. This incident was solely due to economic pressure after being unemployed. The criminal court president of the First Special Court, Mr. Qian Hongye, and Prosecutor Dun Wei opened the court for interrogation. The Capture Station's lawyer, Li Zhishan, stated the case and filed a lawsuit based on Article 363, Section 3 of the Criminal Law, for attempted fraud, requesting that he be punished according to the law. He also stated that the Capture Station confronted the defendant Hou Wenqin with the three captured kidnappers, and all three kidnappers said they did not know Hou. Therefore, it was confirmed that he had no connection with the kidnapping case and was purely opportunistic. Subsequently, Chief Detective Zhang and Detective Cui presented the circumstances of the case in succession. Hou Wenqin confessed to the fraud without denial and said that he was truly young and ignorant, requesting leniency. President Qian reviewed the confession and announced the judgment in court, considering that he was young and a first-time offender, and leniently sentenced him to four months of imprisonment. The number of days of detention before the judgment was final was calculated as two days offsetting one day of imprisonment.</p>

<p>The rent set for the houses in Daoli Lane on Fuxu Road in the French Concession is even higher than the market price for similar houses in prosperous areas. Moreover, due to the economic depression, all industries are lifeless, and it is really difficult for the tenants to bear this huge amount of rent. Therefore, a rent reduction movement was launched. Previously, the landlord was requested several times to reduce the original amount by 40%. The tenants elected Mr. Lu to negotiate with the landlord with full authority. As a result, according to Mr. Lu's report at the Second Special District Citizens' Union meeting yesterday, the landlord was willing to reduce each house by five yuan. The tenants found the difference between the requested amount to be too great and difficult to accept. They still nominated Mr. Lu to make further efforts to strive for the landlord, and at the same time hired lawyer Chen Bingxing to engage in legal remedies to achieve the final goal.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Patrol Police Encounter and Arrest Bandit <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Zhenwen Accused of Multiple Robberies</p>
<p>The Public Security Bureau of the Fourth District of Zhabei has recently solved many theft cases in succession. Except for those that are currently under investigation and the arrest of the remaining accomplices, which cannot be announced for the time being, around 8:00 PM the night before last, Inspector Li Qingjie of the Taiyang Temple police station dispatched Police Chief Yang Jintang, leading policemen Zhang Qingquan, Zhang Shengsan, Yuan Huizhang, and Li Yutang, to patrol Taiyang Temple Road and Changxing Road (the newly opened, unfinished road north of the Jiajun Guild Hall). They encountered two suspicious bandits. As the police officers were about to step forward to question them, one of the bandits took out a pistol from his pocket. Before he could fire, he was bravely embraced by a police officer. The other bandit took the opportunity to escape. Because the address was desolate and in the dark, he could not be chased. Therefore, the pistol in the hand of the captured bandit was seized. The number was checked to be 241067, a Browning pistol with three bullets. After taking him to the station, it was said that his name was Zhang Zhenwen, 32 years old, from Anhui. Today, he intended to go to Xiaoshadu to rob, and he was not doing a case there, etc. Inspector Li immediately ordered that he be escorted to the Fourth District. Upon questioning, the bandit confessed that he lived in the stove room at No. 38 Jinxiu Lane, Changxing Road, and cohabited with Liu San, who was on the run. The questioning officer immediately ordered the detective team to search his home, but nothing was found. Only a doorplate was retrieved, with the name Liu Ziqing (i.e., Liu San) written on it. Upon further questioning, the bandit confessed that he had robbed a cigarette paper shop on Baoxing Road in the Fifth District, obtaining more than 50 yuan; more than 20 days ago, he had robbed a small hotel on Qingyun Road, obtaining more than 10 yuan; a glass factory and an old woman on Zhongxing Road, obtaining several yuan and two gold rings; seven or eight days ago, he had robbed a rice shop on Jiaotong Road, obtaining one gold ring and more than 20 cents. All of the above robberies were carried out with Liu San and Zhang Zhaoyu, who had already returned to his hometown. The pistol belonged to Liu San. After reviewing the confession, the questioning officer, considering that the bandit had repeatedly committed robbery cases, should be detained temporarily and sent to the Public Security Bureau for transfer to the Shanghai Local Court for punishment.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Lawsuit for Infringing on Talc Powder Brand Name <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Tongrenhe Paint Shop on Fahua Minguo Road was founded in the Tongzhi period of the late Qing Dynasty and also sold Guangfeng brand talc powder from Guangdong, with flourishing business. In the spring of last year, it was discovered that Shen Taiyuan on Beijing Road was infringing on the brand name talc powder and selling it on the market. Xu Chengxun, the manager of Tongrenhe, originally intended to investigate deeply, but after Lu Zhonglian came forward to mediate, Shen Taiyuan published an apology in the newspaper and compensated for the loss. Now, after several months, it was again discovered that the talc powder boxes sold by Shen Taiyuan were infringing on Tongrenhe's registered Guangfeng brand trademark imitations, and attached a copy of the license registered with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in the name of Cao Hongzhang, and the paper was printed with the words "Registered Shanghai Wholesale Location: Zhangshou Lane, Qiujiang Road". Tongrenhe then ordered people to investigate. There was only a small school, no shop assistants and no inventory. The shop then considered that Wang Shaoqing, the manager of Shen Taiyuan, and Cao Hongzhang were suspected of colluding to set up a fictitious firm name, and then hired lawyers Fei Guoxi and Jiang Rong to accuse Wang and Cao of harming the business community in the First Special Court. The court opened the trial the other day, because it still needs to be investigated, the date was changed for another trial. However, Cao Hongzhang suddenly submitted a statement to the Second Special Court, accusing Xu Chengxun of counterfeiting the trademark. The court opened yesterday, and the defendant requested a joint trial. Because the First Special Court was related to this case, the court requested instructions and then ordered the proceedings to await the decision of the First Special Court.</p>

<p>To the esteemed editor: Upon reading today's local news section of your newspaper, which reported the arrest of Weng Yuanfan, an employee of our association in charge of weights and measures, for embezzlement, the report stated that this matter was discovered by the chairman of our association, Lu Wenshao, after checking the accounts with the Weights and Measures Inspection Bureau and obtaining conclusive evidence. This is slightly inconsistent with the facts. Our association's weights and measures have always been managed by employee Weng Yuanfan. During the recent re-election of executive committee members, as the old and new committees transitioned, an inventory of the stored weights and measures was conducted, and it was discovered that the employee had "fraudulently" embezzled proceeds from the sale of the equipment, totaling 130 yuan. In addition, there were also instruments that had not been inspected and were sold to colleagues without proper authorization. This matter is of great significance. Because the employee committed embezzlement and violated criminal law, employee Weng Yuanfan and three account books were sent to the No. 1 District and No. 2 Branch Public Security Bureau for investigation. At the same time, a formal lawsuit was filed with the court. This is the course of events handled by our association, which is slightly inconsistent with the details reported in the newspaper. Therefore, we are sending this letter and respectfully request the chief editor to publish this letter in order to make a correction. Sincerely, Shanghai Rice Industry Association, February 1st.</p>
<p>To the esteemed editor: I recently read on the fourth page of your newspaper that an airplane crashed in Hongqiao the day before yesterday, with very detailed descriptions. After investigation, not only has there been no such incident here, but there has also been no news of it. I am very shocked, and today there have been many inquiries from various places after seeing the report. However, there is definitely no such thing here. I hereby request a correction to clarify the truth. Sincerely, Hongqiao Aerodrome, Aviation Administration of the Military Commission, February 1st.</p>
<p>To the editor: I read in the local news section of your newspaper on January 31, 1934, about my dangerous situation of being kidnapped, which is not consistent with the facts. I am afraid that the rumors are false, the truth is unknown, and the audience is confused, which has a significant impact. Therefore, I am hereby providing the points of inconsistency, as follows: Dehe Gongji Dye Shop is not opened by me as a shareholder, but I am only an employee of the company. I respectfully request that the above-mentioned points of inconsistency be corrected and published in the "Letters to the Editor" column. I would be most grateful. Sincerely, Fan Aisheng, Shanghai, February 1, 1934.</p>
<p>To the esteemed editor: In the local section of your newspaper on the 29th of last month, it was published that Dinghua Paper Flower Shop in Mayuan Lane, Xiaodongmen, was negligent and attempted to claim fire insurance. Upon investigation, the items sold in our shop are all made of silk, satin, and paper. Due to a careless ember, a fire broke out. Moreover, our shop's business is still good, and we would never resort to such self-destructive behavior. The Public Security Bureau has also inquired and released us, confirming that it was an accident. I respectfully request that you make a correction. I am deeply grateful. Sincerely, Yao Hanming, Shopkeeper.</p>

<h3 id="e176">Reading and Low-Grade Tastes (I) <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Reading Guidance (Continued)</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I often feel presumptuous in trying to guide people, urging them not to waste their time on these mind-numbing wastes. However, because I lack the scholarly ability to critique, I can never convince them. A relatively difficult book, for example, The Slaughterhouse! I once borrowed it from the library. I eagerly opened it to read, but I found it very difficult, the sentences were too long, not in line with my previous reading habits, and the place names and personal names were all so unfamiliar that I had to reduce my interest considerably. Although I got a lot of help from "Little Kai", which reduced some of the difficulties, it was too much trouble to read such a novel so laboriously. I could only feel a "bitter smile". Of course, this is not a current difficulty, this difficulty has long been overcome by me.</p>
<p>However, I still lack the ability to overcome the difficulties of others. But from experience, I realized that they are obscured by a low-grade taste. They can still be overcome, they can still regain the light; and they urgently need light.</p>
<p>However, in order to overthrow the low-grade taste, there must first be a high-grade taste to replace it. How can we overcome the current "high-grade" "difficulty" in order to make "high-grade" have "taste"? To make people persuaded, you have to dig up the roots of those "weeds", and don't think that the grasslands that have been burned by fire will not happen again in the spring. On this point, we have to make another effort to popularize criticism of the poisons of the old and new Mandarin Duck Butterfly school!</p>
<p>Sir, the words are too incoherent. In summary, it is just one sentence: How to improve the general taste. Although, this project is only fit for you to do, and should be done now. Only when this point is achieved will your work not be serving a few people. The small clerks and apprentices have only received your gift.</p>
<p>What needs to be liberated is the taste of the vast number of apprentices and clerks. Although I have a half-knowledge and a half-understanding, I just feel that I don't know how to do it. The above opinions are entirely mine, but the text was drafted for me by "Little Kai", because I am afraid that the book does not express my intentions and cannot make you fully understand, not because I am afraid that the writing is not smooth and I will lose face.</p>
<p>Finally, I respectfully request that you do not hesitate to provide detailed guidance and corrections.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 1st) According to the request of the China Social Education Society, the Ministry of Education has issued an order to increase the funding for social education and train talents. On the 1st, it ordered all provinces and cities where the funding for social education has not reached the prescribed standard to step up efforts to increase the funding and strive to meet the standard. Those that have real difficulties and cannot immediately meet the standard should also formulate a plan for increasing funding year by year, and report it for assessment. The training of social education talents is also extremely important. In provinces and cities that have established training institutions, the process of establishment and the latest training status should be reported on time. Those that have not yet established training institutions should earnestly plan to establish them and submit a plan for assessment in advance. The Ministry of Education ordered all departments and bureaus to consult with the provincial governments on the following points of the annual meeting resolutions reported by the China Social Education Society: 1. The county governments should be ordered to instruct all public officials in the location of civil education institutions to do their best to assist in the progress of civil education and to establish assessment methods to assign responsibilities. 2. All provinces should be ordered to organize overseas social education and rural education inspection groups, with one or two people from each province joining several provinces to organize. The inspection funds should be allocated by each province as appropriate. 3. All provinces and cities should be ordered to instruct social education institutions to pay attention to object teaching and film teaching. After investigation, the above three proposals are all aimed at promoting and advancing social education. Except for the part of the third proposal related to the Film Censorship Committee, which has been instructed to comply with the Ministry of Internal Affairs, all the original first and third proposals should be followed and implemented. In addition to the separate orders, the original resolutions will be printed and distributed for compliance.</p>

<p>Summary of Two Speeches by Education Ministry Inspector Dai Xia</p>
<p>Education Ministry Inspector Dai Xia returned from inspecting education in Zhejiang Province and gave a speech on the Central Radio Station's wireless platform last week. This Monday, he gave a report at the Ministry of Education's memorial week. The content of the two speeches differed slightly. We have received his summary of the key points of the two speeches, which are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) On Education Administration</p>
<p>The organization of education administrative organs at all levels in the province is generally sound, the implementation of laws and regulations is considered earnest, and various regulations and administrative policies and plans are mostly practical and feasible. Among them, the guidance conference and the education bureau chief's rural inspection system are particularly outstanding and worthy of our reference. The purpose of the guidance conference is to promote elementary education and social education. Its organization is divided into four levels: province, provincial school district (roughly divided into eleven school districts based on the old prefectural districts), county/city, and county/city school district. The guidance conference is chaired by the Department of Education as the initiating body. The provincial school district guidance conferences are respectively chaired by the affiliated elementary schools of provincial middle schools and the provincial or substitute social education guidance institutions. The county/city guidance conferences are chaired by the county/city education bureaus, all of which serve as connecting hubs. The basic organization is the county/city school district guidance conference, chaired by the central elementary school and the county-run public education center or county-run central public school to discuss various practical issues related to elementary education and social education. This system has been implemented for four years, and the work is relatively intensive. The efficiency of elementary and social education has increased significantly as a result. The second is the system of rural inspections by education bureau chiefs. It is currently stipulated that the education bureau chiefs of each county and city should spend four weeks of each semester inspecting rural areas. Their task is to conduct spot checks and rectify the work of various education institutions, investigate the financial situation of education in various rural areas, pay attention to the communication between education institutions and the public, and, when necessary, convene talks with township chiefs and other relevant people on urging the establishment of more schools and filling enrollment quotas, or visit enthusiastic education or public-spirited gentry to exchange views on improving education. This system has just been announced and implemented for a short time, but it will definitely achieve satisfactory results in the future.</p>
<p>(2) On Education Funding</p>
<p>The total amount of education funding in the province was more than 2.83 million yuan in the 20th year of the Republic (1931). In the 21st year (1932), due to the implementation of austerity measures, only more than 2.24 million yuan was spent. This year, it has been further reduced to 2,106,436 yuan. The amount of funding is not very abundant, and it is decreasing year by year. The financial difficulties are obvious. However, various education programs in the province have been able to not only maintain their original state but also make reasonable progress in both quality and quantity under this extremely tight economic situation, which is commendable. However, it is also inevitable that various facilities have not been able to be fully developed due to the shortage of funds.</p>
<p>Although the province's finances have been extremely difficult over the years, education funds have been prioritized for allocation. However, the independence of education funding has been repeatedly urged by the Ministry of Education recently, and the provincial authorities also feel the need to stabilize education funding. Therefore, they have formulated measures to realize it in stages. The main points are to designate 1.2 million yuan annually from the tax on foil products, about 200,000 yuan annually from the tobacco and alcohol surtax, and about 600,000 yuan annually from the slaughter tax, totaling about 2 million yuan, as special funds for provincial education, to be implemented in three phases. From May of next year, it can be completely independent. The issue of independent education funding has come to an end.</p>
<p>The sources of local education funding are quite complex. The main ones are: 40% of the education tax, surcharges on land tax in the upper and lower periods, grain tax per mu, slaughter tax, property transfer deed tax, local product tax, commercial subsidy tax, superstition tax, consumption tax, luxury tax, and other miscellaneous taxes. The total amount is 3,007,251 yuan. Among the counties, the expenditure on education is the highest at 284,113 yuan and the lowest at 5,649 yuan. Except for a few counties, the education funding in most counties was originally very tight. Moreover, most of them have experienced reduced income due to the impact of the rural economic decline, and most counties have accumulated excessive debts over the years, making rectification even more difficult. The Department of Education is urgently seeking remedies. In terms of increasing revenue, it has already submitted a request to the government to allocate 20% of the newly added local taxes in the future to supplement local education funding. It is expected that there will be a large amount of additional funding. As for rectification, detailed measures have also been formulated and supervised to be implemented, but so far, no significant results have been achieved, and further efforts are still needed.</p>
<p>(3) On Higher Education</p>
<p>In addition to national and private schools, the province only has one provincial higher education institution, the Medical and Pharmaceutical Vocational School. The school has a long history and its management is practical. Graduates also have good career prospects. However, in recent years, due to financial constraints, medical and scientific equipment has not been fully perfected. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Report by Education Ministry Commissioner Li Ximou</p>
<p>9. Free Education Measures and Scholarships</p>
<p>The scholarship and free education measures in Jiangxi Province are similar to those in Anhui Province. There are government-funded quotas for studying abroad, scholarships for universities outside the province, and grants for secondary schools and above within the province. Rural normal schools are exempt from all tuition and board fees, and normal schools are exempt from tuition fees and subsidized for half of the board fees. The various measures are described as follows: (A) "On the Implementation of Overseas Study Education and Improvement Policies." Jiangxi Province's overseas students are divided into two types: those studying in Japan and those studying in Europe and the United States. The expenses for students studying in Japan are supplemented according to the regulations for managing overseas students in Japan. Government-funded students who are admitted to various imperial universities in Japan, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo University of Commerce, Chiba Medical University, Tokyo University of Arts and Sciences, Keio University's Faculty of Science, Waseda University's Faculty of Science and Engineering, and Japan Women's University (all of the above universities are limited to undergraduates) are given 84 yen per month. Those who are admitted to Fukuoka Meiji Vocational School, Ueda Sericulture Vocational School, Chiba Medical University's Pharmaceutical Department, Tokyo Ueno Music School, Tokyo Ueno Art School, Tokyo Higher Normal School, Tokyo Women's Higher Normal School, Nara Women's Higher Normal School, Japan's National First to Eighth Higher Schools, Fukushima Higher Normal School, Tokyo Women's Medical Vocational School (all of the above schools are limited to undergraduates), and Tokyo Institute of Technology Preparatory School, Tokyo University of Commerce Preparatory School are given 76 yen per month. As for subsidies, self-funded students from this province who are admitted to the first year or above of undergraduate studies in higher vocational schools and private universities in Japan, and female students who are studying in the vocational departments of official or private vocational schools and above are eligible for supplementation. The fixed number is 15, with each person receiving 17 yen per month. There are 10 subsidy students. The qualifications are those who have obtained the Japanese Ministry of Education's G-type funding to study in university undergraduate programs, receiving 14 yen per month, or those who are studying in higher or vocational schools or university preparatory courses, receiving 6 yen per month. Government-funded students in Europe and the United States are selected by the Department of Education and are not supplemented. The quota is set at 5 for the United States, 2 for the United Kingdom, 2 for France, 2 for Germany, and 3 for other countries. Each person in the United States receives 90 US dollars per month, the United Kingdom 20 pounds, France 1,800 francs, and Germany 360 marks. Other countries are determined on a temporary basis. The cost of going abroad and outfitting is a total of 1,000 yuan in national currency per person, and the cost of returning home is 600 yuan. The number of subsidy students is set at 8 for the United States, 2 for the United Kingdom, 8 for France, 3 for Germany, and 4 for other countries. The amount paid to each person is based on one-third of the government-funded students in that country. However, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident, students studying in Japan have returned to the country one after another, requesting to transfer to other schools. The Department of Education has formulated interim measures for transferring to schools at home and abroad, and it has been decided that those who transfer to Europe and the United States will be treated with half of the government funding (half of the government funding for Europe and the United States). There are a total of 8 people, including Wan Quansheng (4 of whom have not yet gone abroad). Most of the remaining students have returned to Japan to resume their studies. As for government-funded subsidy students studying in Europe and the United States, many have also returned home after their terms have expired. In order to reorganize overseas education and clear up arrears, the Department of Education has submitted a proposal to the Provincial Government Committee, which has decided that from May of the 21st year (1932), regardless of whether they are government-funded or subsidy students in the East or West, and the vacant quotas for subsidies for studying in Japan, all will be temporarily suspended. This has been forwarded for compliance. Currently, there are more than 39,000 yuan in arrears for overseas study expenses, which have been paid off. It is planned to hold an examination for government-funded students to study in Europe and the United States once next year. The subjects will be limited to talents that meet the needs of the province. The overseas study expenses and the current list of overseas students are recorded below. (1) "Overseas Study Budget and Comparison for the 22nd Year (1933)." The overseas study expenses for Japan in the 21st year (1932) were 113,614 yuan, while in the 22nd year (1933) it was 78,621 yuan, a decrease of 34,993 yuan compared to the 21st year (1932). The overseas study expenses for Europe and the United States in the 21st year (1932) were 65,388 yuan, while in the 22nd year (1933) it was 64,106 yuan, a decrease of 1,282 yuan compared to the 21st year (1932). (2) "Statistics of Government-Funded and Subsidy Students Studying Abroad." There are 64 government-funded students in Japan, 1 in the UK, and 2 in Germany. There are 3 half-government-funded students in Germany and 1 in France. There are 5 subsidy students in Japan, 1 in Germany, 7 in France, and 3 in the United States. There is 1 student in Switzerland. There is 1 subsidy student in Japan. (B) "On Scholarship Measures and Improvement Opinions." Jiangxi Province has formulated scholarship measures for self-funded students studying in Europe and the United States, stipulating that the scholarship amount is 10 names. The qualifications are those who are studying in the first year or above of a university graduate school and have special achievements, and the subjects they are studying must meet the needs of the province. Those who apply for scholarships must submit their documents to the Department for review before July 31st of each year and submit them to the Ministry of Education for approval. The amount is 30 US dollars per month for each person in the United States, 120 marks in Germany, 600 francs in France, and 6 pounds in the United Kingdom. Other countries are determined on a temporary basis. The maximum period for receiving the scholarship is no more than three years. The above measures have been announced and implemented in September of this year. Currently, students from Jiangxi who are studying in various countries are requesting scholarships, and most of them are studying in liberal arts and law. In order to encourage talents in practical subjects, the Department of Education plans to prioritize supplementation for those who are studying in engineering, agriculture, science, and medicine in order to meet the needs and pay special attention to students with excellent grades. (C) "Measures for Grants to Students in Secondary Schools and Above." In the past, secondary schools and above once established scholarships, but they were suspended due to financial difficulties. In October of the 21st year (1932), the previous measures were revised and renamed the Grant Regulations. The total amount is still 20,000 yuan. All schools are ordered to report 5% of the total number of students in the school. Those who pass the review by the Department of Education are divided into three grades: A, B, and C, and given grants. These measures have been effectively implemented. (D) "Revised Regulations on Scholarships for Students from Jiangxi Province Studying in Universities and Vocational Schools Outside the Province." Students from Jiangxi Province who are studying in national universities or vocational schools outside the province have previously established regulations for subsidies to provide assistance. However, the regulations do not have a limit on the number of students. All students from Jiangxi Province, except those who are repeating a grade, can receive the subsidies. In recent years, the number of students from Jiangxi Province who have been admitted to universities and vocational schools outside the province has increased sharply, resulting in a huge shortfall in the original budget for subsidies. Moreover, this kind of general subsidy measure is not in line with the government's purpose of rewarding and educating the talents needed today. Therefore, it has been specially revised and changed to scholarship regulations, which are classified by department and limit the number of students, and will be effectively implemented from the 22nd year (1933). The province has revised the Regulations on Scholarships for Students from Jiangxi Province Studying in Universities and Vocational Schools Outside the Province, which have ten articles. The main points are: (1) Set up scholarship quotas for students from Jiangxi Province in various universities and vocational schools: (A) National Universities, University Graduate Schools, Vocational Schools. (B) Private Jinling University's Department of Agriculture, Nankai University's College of Science, Xiehe Medical College, Nantong University's Textile Department. (C) Vocational schools and above that are decided by the Department of Education at the Provincial Affairs Conference according to local needs. (2) The scholarship quota is set at 400 students. Before the existing subsidy students are terminated, they will be supplemented in four phases. The first phase is 50 new students in the 22nd year (1933), the second phase is 90 additional students in the 23rd year (1934), the third phase is 120 additional students in the 24th year (1935), and the fourth phase is 140 additional students in the 25th year (1936). In the future, vacancies will be filled as they occur. (3) The distribution of scholarship quotas: engineering accounts for 20%, agriculture 15%, science 15%, medicine 10%, commerce and law 10%, art 5%, physical education 5%, home economics 5%, and literature, philosophy, and education 5%. (4) Students from Jiangxi Province who are handled in accordance with the regulations and pass the review by the Department of Education can apply for scholarships of 100 yuan per year per person. (5) If the number of students applying for scholarships exceeds the stipulated quota, the Department of Education will follow the following methods: (A) University Graduate School before University. (B) National University before Private University. (C) University before Vocational School. (D) If schools are equal, upper grades before lower grades. (E) If grades are equal, the order is determined by the level of achievement. (The End)</p>

<p>The Secretariat Has Informed Them to Immediately Submit Expenditure Budgets for the Next Year</p>
<p>In recent years, the Boxer Indemnity that China was supposed to pay to various countries has been returned one after another by the countries concerned. In principle, most of it is stipulated to be used for education and cultural undertakings. However, the number returned by each country each year is indeed not small. The outside world is mostly unclear about the management methods and use of these funds. The Shanghai Education Association once submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to clearly stipulate unified management methods for the Boxer Indemnity returned by various countries and to publish detailed annual income and expenditure information. The Central Political Conference also decided at its 372nd meeting to hand it over to the Executive Yuan for proper handling. The Executive Yuan then convened a meeting of representatives from various Gengkuan agencies on November 6th of last year, including Li Shizeng, Zhang Renjie, Ren Hongjun, Shi Ying, Zhu Jiahua, Li Shuhua, and Zeng Rongpu, totaling more than ten people. At the same time, representatives from the Ministry of Finance, the Auditing Department, and the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, as well as Minister of Education Wang Shijie, Vice Minister Duan Xipeng, Secretary-General Chu Minyi, and Director of Political Affairs Peng Xuepei were invited to attend the discussion. In addition to Chairman Wang of the Executive Yuan reporting on the purpose of the meeting, representatives from various Gengkuan agencies also reported on the situation of their respective agencies. The results of the meeting were very good. A total of three cases were resolved regarding the budget preparation process, two cases regarding reimbursement and auditing, and six cases regarding cooperation between various Gengkuan agencies. It was also decided to hold meetings in March and November of this year. During the adjournment, an office for the joint meeting of Gengkuan agencies was established, with one secretary handling the affairs of the meeting under the order of the President of the Executive Yuan. Now that the time for the March meeting is approaching, Chairman Wang has specially instructed the Secretariat to promptly urge various Gengkuan agencies to prepare the matters to be handled in accordance with the resolutions of the previous meeting. It is reported that the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan has separately notified the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture, the Sino-French Education Foundation Committee, the Board of Trustees for the Administration of the British Boxer Indemnity Fund, the Sino-He Boxer Indemnity Committee, and the Sino-Belgian Boxer Indemnity Committee to comply with the instructions. The original letter is copied as follows: By order of the President of the Executive Yuan, it is found that the first item, paragraph 1 of the resolutions of the Gengkuan meeting on November 6th of last year states that each Gengkuan agency must, from the 24th year of the Republic (1935), prepare the budget and explanation of use for the next year of each agency before January 15th of each year and send it to the Executive Yuan for review by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics and the Ministry of Education (for the 23rd year (1934), the budget and explanation of use should be sent to the Executive Yuan two months before the original budget preparation period of each agency). Also, the second item, paragraph 3 states that the aforementioned joint meeting will be convened by the Executive Yuan once a year in December from the 24th year of the Republic (1935) to discuss the important principles or other important matters regarding the use of the budget of each Gengkuan agency for education and cultural undertakings (in the 23rd year (1934), meetings will be held in March and December). Paragraph 4 states that each Gengkuan agency... must submit to the Executive Yuan in writing the amount and plan regarding the use of the budget of each agency for education and cultural undertakings for the next year before the meeting.

<h3 id="e191">National Shanghai College of Commerce Students' School Protection Movement <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Preparatory Assembly: Since the Ministry of Education announced the news of the suspension of night schools in Shanghai's universities, students have been extremely alarmed. Students of the National Shanghai College of Commerce's Specialized Department recently convened dozens of classmates to discuss countermeasures and immediately established a Preparatory Committee for the School Protection Association of the Department of Specialized Studies of the College. Many measures were discussed, and five representatives were selected to visit President Pei of the college on the morning of the previous day to inquire about the truth. President Pei received them and gave a speech (the text is recorded separately). After the representatives returned to the meeting at 7:00 PM that night and reported, everyone believed that although the Ministry of Education ordered the gradual closure, the authorities immediately suspended them, and they all believed that the situation was serious and advocated convening a general assembly to discuss everything. It was decided to be held on the evening of February 2nd at 6:00 PM in the Specialized Department's school.</p>
<p>President's Speech: It is briefly stated that the night school system is indeed an urgent facility in view of China's current social situation and to satisfy the thirst for knowledge of the general unemployed youth. I have had a development plan for the night school of this college to benefit the youth and achieve significant results. At the beginning of the current semester, I decided to hire expert professors to enrich the curriculum. I am very happy that the students can understand this intention, work hard, and not slack off, which is gratifying. The Ministry of Education once sent someone to investigate, and the report on the night school of this college was quite satisfactory. Unexpectedly, the order to suspend the school was suddenly issued. As a national university, this college should accept government orders. However, although the Ministry of Education ordered the gradual closure, I have considered this matter several times and felt that the facts and the future are indeed very difficult. Therefore, as soon as I paid attention to the suspension, I had already taken steps to handle the transfer procedures for students' schooling. The representatives then asked him to express his personal opinions, saying that because of my position, it is inconvenient for me to express anything.</p>

<h3 id="e194">Recent Situation of Lixin Accounting Tutoring School <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Lixin Accounting Tutoring School, located at 190 Ningbo Road in this city, is affiliated with Lixin Accounting Firm. It has been established for seven years and has achieved excellent results. Graduates from past sessions who are employed in government and business organizations in this city and elsewhere are highly welcomed. The school's last semester has already ended, and this semester is scheduled to begin on February 20th. All course textbooks, such as bank accounting, government accounting, cost accounting, advanced accounting, and auditing, are the Lixin Accounting Series newly compiled and published by Lixin Certified Public Accountants. The content is complete, and the teaching effectiveness is very high. Recently, the original textbooks have been revised in detail by Accountant Pan Xulun, making them more perfect than before, and the level is the same as that of a university. Because there are no fewer than three to four thousand graduates from past night school and correspondence courses, there is usually a lack of opportunity for them to gather. Therefore, on the afternoon of the fourth of this month at 2:00 PM, a grand tea party will be held in the East Hall of the YMCA Cafeteria at Eight Immortals Bridge with the school's alumni association to convene graduates from all sessions. Principal Pan Xulun will report on the past operations and future expansion plans, and Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, and Shi Liangcai, Principal of Shenbao Vocational Tutoring School, will be invited to speak at the meeting. All alumni of the association, whether they have graduated or not, whether they are night school or correspondence students, are invited to attend the meeting.</p>

<p>▲ Fan Wangdu 63... Xiaguang 19</p>
<p>▲ Yonggan 25... Feixia 9</p>
<p>| Two Group A Games and One Group B Game Tonight |</p>
<p>The Fan Wangdu team, formerly known as the St. John's University basketball team, defeated Xiaguang 63-19 last night in the Shanghai Basketball League. St. John's performed poorly in the Western Youth Basketball League. Watching last night's game, their work was meticulous and well-organized, a world apart from before. The speed of their progress is commendable. Lin Qiren of Xiaguang was absent, which inevitably had a slight impact. The situation was almost entirely under the control of Fan Wangdu. The first half was 32-6, and the final result was 63-19. Yonggan's victory over Feixia was also a one-sided affair. Yonggan is composed of unknown players, but they were able to advance step by step, skillfully using tactics, which is worthy of our admiration. Their previous victory over Jianhua was eye-opening. Yesterday's victory over Feixia shows that the team's future is not difficult to follow in the footsteps of the Pirates. In the first half, Yonggan scored 15 points, while Feixia scored only 4 points. The final result was 25-9. In the Group B game, Team 7 defeated the French Army after a fierce battle. The first half was 18-12, and the final result was 30-21. Tonight's three Group A and Group B matches are scheduled as follows:</p>
<p>Team Names | Group | Time | Referee</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>Artillery vs. Eagles | A1 | 6:30 PM | Zhang Bide</p>

<h3 id="e202">Involuntary Marriage <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>Marriage, as it is discussed now, should naturally emphasize freedom. Because a person's life, with one husband and one wife, is a unit. Only with a happy family can there be a sound society, and only with a sound society can there be a strong nation. Therefore, the reason why everyone must seek freedom in marriage is that it is about the independent sovereignty of a lifetime without defects, and it is also about enjoying complete and equal happiness for a hundred years. If it is not like this, but the marriage contract is concluded, or one does not agree, having listened to parents and the relationship between families since childhood, and then blaming the bad consequences of marrying for status, even to the point of both sides cursing each other's parents, this is truly the bad result of involuntary marriage, which no moralist can deny!</p>
<p>Ah! In fact, that is what is said, but I do not know that on the real wedding day, if you look at the status of the bride and groom, whether they have the qualifications for freedom, I am afraid that they do not think about it, but they will suddenly realize that they want to laugh it off! Because of what? Not to mention anything else, just at the time of the wedding, if you want freedom, it is simply like being a prisoner, unable to move freely. The groom must be invited out by the best man, and the bride sits in the car or in the sedan chair, and even more must be supported by the bridesmaid before daring to get up and take a step. No! They can only sit silently in the inside, unable to make a sound, losing their freedom to the extreme. And the fashionable people still talk about "free marriage," and they are infinitely envious, thinking that freedom is at this time. Alas! In fact, it is a real misjudgment! You! Do not see the master of ceremonies standing on a high stool, he is still holding a scarlet etiquette list in his hand, if he does not shout loudly, no one dares to move, so this master of ceremonies, at that time, wields the supreme authority of the whole hall. He shouts to play music, and the drums and music will start to play loudly. He shouts for that one to take a seat, and the guests, introducers, and the presiding and officiating parties also enter one after another. And the bride and groom will even look at the tip of their noses, under the gazes of the audience, slowly being led by the best man and bridesmaid to the same standing ground, not daring to laugh, not raising their heads, listening to people shouting like this, and doing like this. Look at this time, is there any freedom in marriage? If the master of ceremonies does not shout to retreat, no one dares to retreat, even the officiating person must be an elder of mature wisdom and prestige, whose age will of course not be young, and must also follow the master of ceremonies' slogan, otherwise, they will stand there blankly, standing for at least half an hour, and even if their feet are cold and their legs are sore, they still do not dare to leave on their own. Therefore, others say "free marriage," but I insist on saying the opposite, calling it "involuntary marriage." The old-fashioned etiquette of the past was indeed not very good, but now I also feel that there are many meaningless formalities, such as exchanging ornaments and using seals, which are just formalities. And the officiating person, from the surface, seems to guarantee the two newlyweds, so how important is it? Therefore, they usually say a few very good words of instruction, "In the future, they will form a new family and be a good model for society." Humph! Unfortunately, before long, they raise the conditions for divorce, but the officiating person has nothing to do with it, and the law will not summon him to ask how he testified at the time. Haha! Then, are not the others all unnecessary?</p>

<p>— Fu Yizhi</p>
<p>The north wind roared and rushed towards me, plunging into my collar, sleeves, and coat lapels, winding its way into my inner self, making me shiver several times. The tin signs in front of the small shops were blown by the wind and swayed uneasily, sometimes even emitting a sharp, grating sound. There were few pedestrians on the road. Rickshaw pullers could not find customers and dragged their empty vehicles listlessly toward the vast path of life. The men wore torn felt hats, and the women wrapped themselves in floral cloth scarves, carrying loads of chives, celery, radishes, and other vegetables to the small vegetable markets to await the arrival of the maids and young ladies. ... Here, there were no essential people to form the prosperity of the city. At this time, one could not even hear the shouts and songs that punctuated the liveliness, like the frontier and ancient city on the eve of a great battle, with only the soldiers fighting for survival desperately digging trenches to meet their enemies. Ah! This is the morning of winter in a metropolis.</p>
<p>People living in the metropolis, filled with shops, residences, and all things moving and still, have long since ceased to know what is meant by the intoxicating and beautifying nature. The vibrant spring and the artistically meaningful autumn can only be understood and appreciated in the embrace of nature, and its creations of beautiful and poetic artistic scenes. However, the scorching summer and the bone-chilling winter, even in a metropolis, can be felt in the same way as in a remote village thatched cottage, and sometimes even more unbearably, especially on such a winter morning. Unless people have heating pipes indoors and Chevrolets outdoors, they will not feel anything. Who says that a prosperous city is a paradise on earth?</p>
<p>At this time, the wind seemed to have conquered everything and was at its most triumphant. The radiant morning sun can often give the poor a lot of warmth and increase people's body temperature, but the wind is often jealous and refuses to let it "show favor." When the morning sun rises roundly and gradually transmits a little warmth to the world, it roars in gusts, causing the morning sun to present only a faint shadow in the thin clouds. It refuses to leave any remaining power and uses all its brutal instincts on the world. Such a solemn and desolate morning is probably the crystallization of its evil deeds!</p>
<h3 id="e204">Record of a Trip to Wuhan <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Dai Yuren</p>
<p>I once heard a Western friend say that instead of traveling to the three islands of Japan, it would be better to tour and admire the scenery of the Yangtze River. The scenery of the Yangtze River is natural, and there are many historical sites. Moreover, the equipment on the riverboats is comfortable, and there is no suffering from the wind and waves of the sea. Recently, I went to Hankou on business and stayed for five days. After finishing my work, I had a day off, so I went with a friend across the river to Wuchang, and then hired a car for fifteen miles to Luojia Mountain to visit Wuhan University. The school buildings are built on the mountain, magnificent and unparalleled. To the east is the East Lake, similar to the West Lake of Hangzhou, but cleaner. On the opposite bank, there is a garden and a bee farm, run by a certain banker. The air here is fresh, the scenery is beautiful, and the place is secluded, making it very suitable for studying. I lingered for a long time and returned to Wuchang, climbed the Yellow Crane Tower, and overlooked Hanyang and Hankou. Everything was clearly visible. Reciting the Yellow Crane Tower poems of the ancients to the line "The trees of Hanyang are clearly visible on the sunny riverbank," I immediately crossed the river to Hanyang to find the Qingchuan Pavilion, but it was already dilapidated and could not be climbed. I wanted to visit more places, but unfortunately, it was already evening, and the Jiang'an steamship had sounded its whistle, so I immediately returned to Hankou to board the ship. We set sail at nine o'clock, and at midnight we arrived at Huangzhou, where Su Dongpo used to visit the Red Cliff. The next day, we arrived at Jiujiang, and from afar we saw the towering Mount Lu, with its snow still unmelting, which shows how cold the climate is in the mountains. It is also easy to imagine how cool and comfortable it would be in the summer heat, truly a resort for escaping the summer heat. I also bought several kinds of porcelain, exquisite and antique, not as foreign as imported goods. It is a pity that in recent years, Chinese people prefer to use foreign goods, which has led to the decline of the porcelain industry in Jiangxi, which is deeply regrettable. In the afternoon, the boat passed Pengze. The city walls were built along several peaks, relying on the market and along the river. From the boat, I saw this small city, surrounded by mountains on three sides and facing the river on one side, which was quite like a paradise. Tao Yuanming once served as an official here, drinking wine and writing poetry. What more could one ask for than a Peach Blossom Spring? After another few hours, we passed Xiaogushan Mountain, standing tall in the center of the river, incomparably beautiful. The next day, we only reached Datong. From here, we could take a small boat to Mount Jiuhua (one of the four famous mountains in China). Every summer, pilgrims flock to it. We continued downstream and passed Zhenjiang, where Jiaoshan Mountain stood in the river, similar to Xiaogushan Mountain but larger. It is also one of the ancient scenic spots along the river, but I regretted not having time to visit. From Hankou to Shanghai is the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Further up to Sichuan and other places is the upper reaches, where the water flows rapidly and is not as easy to navigate as the lower reaches. Along the way, sails are like forests, and there are many mountains and islands, which are very pleasing to the eye and refreshing to the heart. The historical sites in various places can especially evoke memories of the ancients. The words of my Western friend are indeed true. Moreover, the food on the riverboats is exquisite, and the service is attentive, making travel very convenient. It is a pity that many Chinese people prefer to take foreign ships, because Chinese ships are sometimes requisitioned for military service. This time, I took the Jiang'an to Shanghai and felt that everything, especially the food, was more convenient than on foreign ships. Therefore, I dare to introduce it, also to promote state-owned enterprises.</p>
<h3 id="e205">How Many Pairs of Apples? <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Xingjian</p>
<p>Question: Now there is a basket of apples. Boy A comes and takes half, plus half a pair. Boy B comes again and takes half a pair. Boy C comes and takes half, plus half a pair. After Boy C takes his share, the apples in the basket are completely gone. Now, how many pairs of apples were there in the basket before any were taken? Answer: There were seven pairs of apples in the basket. Note: Before the answer is revealed, this problem seems completely unreasonable. Each of the boys, A, B, and C, takes half, plus half a pair. No matter what, there must be some apples left in the basket. Now, miraculously, they are all gone. How amazing! Boy A takes half, which is three and a half pairs, plus half a pair, for a total of four pairs. Three pairs remain in the basket. Boy B comes and takes half, which is one and a half pairs, plus half a pair, for a total of two pairs. One pair remains. Boy C comes and takes half, which is half a pair, plus another half a pair, which makes a complete pair. Thus, the apples in the basket are all gone.</p>

<p>Chapter 23: Unbearable Pain, Suspicious, Listening to Drums and Music, Happy and Unharmonious Parting, Urgent Summons Arrived</p>
<p>Therefore, when he came to the backyard that evening, he deliberately took a wide detour, went along the side of the wing room to the window of the main room, moistened his finger with saliva, poked a hole, and looked inside. He saw the son-in-law sleeping on the bed with his clothes on, and his own daughter sitting on the edge of the bed. However, although she was sitting on the edge of the bed, she was twisting her body, leaning on the head of the bed, looking as if she was talking to the son-in-law. The conversation was naturally very long, and it did not seem to end for a long time. Although Jiang was an old woman, she could not help but blush, and she had to open her mouth directly. When she returned home, she thought to herself that the relationship between the two of them was indeed good, but such sweetness was not proper with the father-in-law present. In any case, she had to call her daughter back tomorrow during the day and give her a good scolding. Having made up her mind, the next morning, taking advantage of the fact that Guizhi had come to the main room for dinner, she rushed to the backyard. After entering the door, she was shocked. It turned out that Zhao Ziqiang was not only still the ideal person she imagined, happily there, but also with a sad face, holding a piece of paper in his hands in the middle of the hall, completely lost in thought. He did not even see his mother-in-law coming in. Jiang said with a smile, "Son-in-law, what are you looking at? You seem to be enjoying it." Zhao Ziqiang raised his head, looking surprised, and immediately stuffed the paper into his pocket. With this, Jiang became even more suspicious and asked again, "What are you looking at, son-in-law?" Ziqiang smiled bitterly and replied in a very low voice, "It's a telegram." Jiang said, "Where did the telegram come from?" Ziqiang hesitated for a while and smiled, answering in an extremely low voice, "It's a telegram from our battalion commander. He's calling me to hurry back to defend." Jiang said, "Didn't you ask for two weeks of leave?" Ziqiang said, "According to the dates, the time is almost up. A few days of delay on the road, plus a few days arriving home early, wouldn't that be enough for two weeks? But I also calculated that the days were not enough. It turned out I had asked for three weeks. I don't understand why the battalion commander sent a telegram to urge me before the deadline." (236)</p>

<h3 id="e207">Common Foods at the End of the Lunar Year <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Yuan</p>
<p>The wind is howling, the snow is fluttering, another picture of the year coming to a close. Although the Gregorian calendar has been promoted for twenty-three years, the Gregorian New Year is just like Christmas for foreigners, without much change in the folk. The twelfth lunar month is noisy, firecrackers crackle, of course, they are lively decorations in the old calendar. The Chinese people's conservatism is naturally unique, not to mention that this New Year's Eve tradition has been passed down from ancestors to future generations!</p>
<p>At the end of the lunar year, the most important thing, of course, is food. In the colorful tea and food shops, every family prepares New Year's food at the end of the year, to be heartily enjoyed.</p>
<p>Large chunks of meat and whole fish are, of course, essential foods for every family. There are also some more exquisite foods that are also essential for every family in Suzhou. Now I write them down below as a timely recipe.</p>
<p>Fried Fish</p>
<p>At the end of the year, the盆碟 used for dishes is indispensable. Although fried fish is an ordinary dish sold on the市場, it is always more expensive than cooking it yourself. So Suzhou people mostly cook it themselves at the end of the year. The cooking method is also very simple. First wash the grass carp or large bream, cut it into thin slices three or four 分 thick, submerge it in a mixture of scallions, ginger, wine, sugar, and soy sauce, soak it for a day or half a day, then take it out and spread it on a扁 (bamboo product) to dry slightly in the shade. Then heat a large pot of oil and fry the fish slices in the油. When the fish is half-cooked, take it out and re-immerse it in a liquid of wine and soy sauce, and then re-enter the pot to cook until it is cooked through. Some people want the fish to have a fragrant aroma, so after the fish is cooked, they smoke it again on wood chips containing spices, and it is done. Use grass carp for cooking fish, the taste is more rich and delicious than bream.</p>
<p>Shrimp Balls</p>
<p>They are indispensable in hot pot. Method: First take out the shrimp meat, then mash the shrimp meat together with shallots and lard in a small stone mortar until the shrimp meat is like mud, then add egg yolks and mash together. (The number of egg yolks depends on the amount of shrimp meat, about half a catty of shrimp meat, add three egg yolks.) After mixing, add a little salt, then boil a pot of 𣺓 water, make the mashed shrimp meat into round balls like桂圓 and put them in the water. Once the shrimp balls are cooked, they will naturally float to the surface of the water and can be scooped up. There is one thing to pay attention to when making shrimp balls: when putting the raw shrimp balls in 𣺓 water, you need to cook them slowly over a gentle fire, otherwise the shrimp balls will be old and not fresh.</p>
<p>Fish Balls</p>
<p>The method of making fish balls is similar to that of shrimp balls, but some procedures are required when taking out the fish脯 to remove the fine bones. The method of taking out the fish脯 is to first cut open a　fish, and then use a knife to scrape flat on the fish meat, so that the fish meat becomes like mud, attached to the knife, and the fine bones of the fish will naturally gradually be exposed, and must be picked out one by one, and then use that kind of fish sauce, put it in a mortar and mash it, add eggs. The eggs mixed in shrimp balls are egg yolks, but fish balls need egg whites. After the fish balls are made, they become snow-white powder balls. In addition to the above three kinds of dishes at the end of the year, there are also egg dumplings, (egg skins wrapped in meat, made into dumpling shapes,)糟雞, etc., and the tasteless bamboo shoots are indispensable in the dishes at the end of the year. There is a saying in Suzhou, called: "If you have not achieved anything in a year, first dust off the dust, if you have not done anything, first buy bamboo shoots." It can also be seen the importance of bamboo shoots.</p>
<p>Now I want to talk about the snacks at the end of the year. The snacks that ordinary people prepare at the end of the year, in addition to the yellow and white cakes purchased in the market, various kinds of lard cakes, (lard cakes, there are several kinds of rose, mint, white sugar, jujube paste, etc., those in tea and food stores are more expensive than those in cake　stores, but their taste is also sweeter and more oily.)饅頭, Ningbo rice cakes, etc., there are also several kinds made by oneself.</p>

<p>Foreign Telegrams Favorable, Recovered and Rose Five Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, a huge storm occurred in the gold market, fluctuating rapidly. Dealers were uncertain and seemed to be in a fog, buying and selling suddenly, making it difficult to handle. In the morning, it fluctuated around 700 yuan, but foreign telegrams from the United States were mostly favorable to the bulls. According to the largest daily price of 706 yuan and the smallest price of 696 yuan and one 角, the difference was 9 yuan and 9 角. As a result, it recovered and rose 5 yuan. Both near and far term silver markets have reported declines. The closing exchange rate for the British pound fell 4.75 分, the US dollar rose 3.5 分, but the gold market opened slightly higher, calculated at 98 yuan and a half. (The opening　situation was extremely chaotic, with a difference of more than ten yuan. It immediately broke through the 700 yuan mark. Suddenly, news came that New York cash reported a rise of half a 角, and the selling momentum was strong. It eventually retraced through the 700 yuan to 690 yuan marks. In an instant, it was learned that the US dollar was not reporting a rise, but was actually a message that it was planned to be raised to 35 yuan, and it had been raised to 98 yuan.) Afterwards, the shorts urgently covered their positions, and the official listing reached 703 yuan and three 角. By the time foreign exchange was firm and then loose again, the banks' willingness to sell was not weak. Hedgers and bulls successively dumped their positions, and eventually fell to 696 yuan and one 角. Afterwards, it fluctuated around 98 and 9 yuan, closing at 7 yuan and 9 角. Until noon, there was another telegram unfavorable to the shorts, saying that the gold content was reduced, calculated at 5906, and had been signed by the president. There were also provisions for stabilizing exchange rates, etc. Hearing this, the dealers felt even more panicked and rushed to buy without hesitation. Therefore, it broke through the large mark again. The after-market opened at 701 yuan and a half, continuing the momentum after the afternoon close. Then it slightly declined, only on the border of 700 yuan. Then, it was heard that the silver case was temporarily shelved, and the cash price was 35 yuan, and the government was buying heavily, so the large players in the market had strong buying sentiment, and suddenly saw a high price of 706 yuan. Afterwards, the Dalian gang and others constantly sold, and then it fell again. There was not much rise or fall in the middle, until the close was 01 yuan and 8 角, (the opening and closing on the day rose 3 yuan and 3 角 compared to the increase). The British gold squeeze was 0625, the US dollar was 125 to 1875. Now, after recording the daily process in detail,</p>

In an instant, the sellers bravely acted, and Bingxing, Dadecheng, Dachangxiang, Yuanchun, etc. all came out because there was news that the US dollar was reported to be high, and it immediately fell sharply by 13 or 4 yuan, eventually to 99 yuan weak. Soon it turned up again by 8 or 9 yuan. Zhifeng, Yonghuixiang, Yongdexiang and speculators etc. resisted the shorts, so the opening price was 98 yuan with zero, and all parties traded very enthusiastically. After the opening, there were 2 yuan of odd lots, from 99 yuan and 2 角 to 97 yuan, eventually the Guangdong gang resisted the shorts, and it was pushed up to 700 yuan, 005 角, but there were still many sellers, and it retreated to 97 yuan and a half. Later, as the US dollar turned strong, Zhengjin and others absorbed 6 月 625 half yuan, and the dealers also　　　　　calculated 5 月 375 to 35.

After entering, the Dalian gang and Yuanmao, Yongbingxing, etc. sold, and it fell again by 3 yuan or so. Although HSBC listed the British pound flat and the US dollar contracted by 125, the gold price only rose or fell by more than 1 yuan, but it had returned to the large mark. Qianchangxiang, Yifeng, Yongwu品, etc. sold, and Citibank offered the May US dollar at half a yuan, Sassoon offered the June at 6875. And until after 10 o'clock, it was 96 yuan and 1 角, later because Hengxing, Daxing, Yongqingfa, Yong, etc. bought, it increased to 9 yuan and 1 角.

<p>The spot red bars of the Tianjin gang have quick access, and the foreign pure gold is also rising, so it stimulated the Shanghai market. Now, Tongfengheng bought 4500 taels, 1,1112 yuan, and sold them to the Tianjin gang for 1,113 yuan to 3 yuan and a half. Dadecheng also sold 12 yuan.</p>

The registered price was 12 yuan in February, 98 yuan in March, and 12 yuan for the supplementary water. In the afternoon, it was 16 yuan. As the US dollar has been reduced in fineness, the gold price may change. It is said that it is already under discussion.</p>
<p>The trading on the table is complicated and repetitive. According to statistics, Dafayong, Daxingyong, Huixiang, Shunlizhao, Fengchangyong, Deyicheng, Futai, Hengshen, Kang Sida, Hongxingzhi, Yongjun advanced, and there were shorts among them.

<p>Yesterday, the silver market reported a decline, and foreign exchange rates showed a drop in the pound and a rise in the dollar. The local foreign exchange market was particularly chaotic.

The rest remained unchanged. The internal market for the pound sterling saw a reduction of 0.0625. Gold dealers initially bought and then sold. Sassoon bought May contracts.

<p>Yesterday, the trend of interbank lending between Chinese and foreign banks in the market, although the nominal market price still opened at 2%, the actual situation has improved slightly. Therefore, the interest rate for overdrafts with added security was 2-3%, which is quite different from the white interest rate in the market. However, it is difficult to have a significant improvement at the end of the lunar new year settlement period. The transaction of lending notes has been decreasing day by day. In the morning market, transfers were over 2.1 million, new transactions were over 500,000, noon market transactions were over 300,000, and small General Chamber of Commerce transactions were over 200,000. Foreign mortgage loans redemption transactions were 600,000 to 700,000, and new transactions were over 700,000. Banknote withdrawals and issuance were 1.3 to 1.4 million.

Qian Zhuang (native banks) collected and settled over 43 million yuan of foreign public notes, over 8.5 million in foreign currency overdrafts, over 300,000 in various foreign exchange remittances, collections of 400,000 to 500,000, customer remittances of 150,000, and remittances of 100,000. The market conditions in various ports this year are also declining, so annual settlements are also delayed, and remittances are very scarce.</p>
<p>Also, the total exchange amount of the local clearing house in one day was 21,700,589.84 silver dollars, including 17,770,962.75 silver dollars, and 3,934,927.09 silver dollars in remittance transfers.</p>

<h3 id="e215">Securities Market: The Bond Market at 96% Has Become the Center of Speculation <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<h3 id="e216">Each Bond Fluctuates and Rises by 0.1-0.8 Yuan <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market of the Chinese Merchants Stock Exchange was extremely stable, and the overall trend had entered a consolidation phase. The trading volume was also relatively quiet. Although there were large players entering and exiting the market, it was not as active as before. Generally, it will be held for one or two days. Although the number of accounts is huge, there are many profit-taking transactions. Speculators, seeing that short-selling is not the time and that going long is also uninteresting, turned their attention to making large trades on the 96 bonds. Judging from the daily turnover of the 96 bonds in recent days, which is about 2 million, it can be seen the heat of speculation. Yesterday's market price went up all the way. The military reduction bonds rose by 0.8 yuan this month, and the 96 bonds also rose by 0.6 to 0.75 yuan, with the rise almost equal to that of the military reduction bonds. This phenomenon occurs every time the bond market rises to a considerable height. Everyone knows that the 96 bonds have no solutions and no interest, but with a surge of speculation, waves rise by themselves. This is because its bottom is too small and it is easy to stir up. In the morning initial auction yesterday, there seemed to be signs of fatigue. The compilation and reduction were slightly smaller by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. The military reduction 15th was sold, and the 16th was bought, with fierce competition. The market price turned from low to high, and the market sentiment became firm because of this. After that, it was also unanimously returned up by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan. There were many shift trading and profit-taking transactions in the second auction. The military reduction bonds rose by 0.6 yuan, and gradually became weak and flat after entering. The market opened in the afternoon. Many No. 1 sold military reduction bonds, and all items were therefore lackluster, either rising or falling, with very slight fluctuations. The closing price was slightly weaker in the front row and slightly higher by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan in the back row. Generally, it did not break away from the consolidation. The market price resulted in a total rise of 0.1 to 0.8 yuan. The total turnover was 11,128,500 yuan, including 2,000 yuan in spot goods. The total turnover tax for futures was 3,455,000 yuan, 1,940,000 yuan for military reduction bonds, 710,000 yuan for the 19 Customs bonds, 1,260,000 yuan for the 20 Customs bonds, 1,790,000 yuan for the gold short, and 1,500,000 yuan for the 96 bonds. The rest ranged from tens of thousands to 200,000 to 300,000.</p>

<p>According to a report from New Asia Trading Company, the New York stock market was mixed and slightly weaker on the 31st. Aviation stocks remained strong, while steel stocks were quite weak, because the operating reports of various steel companies in 1933 would not have much progress. And according to Steel Age, the general regulations on the steel industry are gradually dissatisfied. A major automobile company reduced a large number of orders due to the inability to obtain cheap prices. Bonds, including U.S. government bonds, rose due to unusually enthusiastic public purchases. The total turnover for the day was 3.11 million shares. According to Steel Age, the steel workload was 35%, mostly orders from the automotive industry. The goods of several companies in this quarter have been sold out. The needs of the railway seem to be coming late. The "wheat" market presented an oversold phenomenon. The news was favorable to the bulls and should be bought. "Cotton" first rose due to rumors that gold prices would move, and then gold prices did rise to $35. The dollar was set at 9.06 cents. Punk's case and private reports of reduced production were all good. The final period of reduced production was extended to February 15. The market situation seems to continue to rise. The Dow Jones index is listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e218">Yarn: Outside Cotton Brings High Standard Yarn <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market showed a slightly firm appearance. The news in overseas cotton markets was good, which slightly boosted market sentiment. But spot yarn transactions are still sluggish. Due to the upcoming end of the lunar new year, there is a temporary closure of commerce, so the market looks more depressed.</p>
<h3 id="e219">April Futures Yarn Rises Eight Fen <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>At the Renbiao opening in the morning market, the market atmosphere was still flat. Later, the buying sentiment in April was slightly tighter, and the near months were also stimulated. Each month rose by 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 fen. In the afternoon, buyers in April continued to enter, and each month rose by another 0.2 to 0.3 fen. The total transaction volume for the day was 5,950 bales. It was found that the sellers were Yuan Da (700 bales), Heng De (200 bales), Da Chang (150 bales), Tai Chang (250 bales), and Yong Chang (250 bales). The buyers were Jin Chang (2,350 bales), Chong Yu (350 bales), Chun Ji (800 bales), Ren Feng (300 bales), and Chang Feng (200 bales). The closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>Spot yarn sales have become more sluggish again. It was found that the total amount bought by various groups throughout the day was 460 bales. The market conditions were similar to the previous day. The amount bought by each group is as follows:</p>
<p>Sichuan 10, Inland 202, Changsha 10, Ningbo 2, Yunnan 60</p>
<p>Shantou 10, Guangdong 20, Nanjing 15, Peers 20, Wuhu 10</p>
<p>The cotton market was tired in the morning and rose in the afternoon. The situation is still tight. Many bulls in the market expect the U.S. cotton market to trend upward tomorrow, so buying picked up suddenly in the afternoon. However, spot cotton consumption in the market is still not smooth, and the market atmosphere is slightly flat. It is difficult to grasp what the future holds.</p>

<p>The opening of Zheng Biao in the morning market was flat and tired, and each month fell by 0.05. In the afternoon, it was heard that gold prices were trending up and that the outside cotton had good news, and there were more buyers. Each month rose by 0.05 to 0.25 fen. The total transaction volume for the day was 38,200 dan. It was found that the sellers were Ji Feng (3,900 dan), Da Feng (1,100 dan), Shen Ji (1,100 dan), Chang Feng (2,000 dan), Yuan Xing Chang (3,500 dan), Sui Long (1,000 dan), and Yuan Da (2,000 dan).

<p>Spot cotton business is still not prosperous. Factories need yarn, and the market is depressed. Imports are still sluggish, with 680 bales of Yaohua cotton and 850 bales of Tonghua cotton. The spot cotton prices are as follows: Lingbao cotton $46.75 - Shanghai factory imports 100 pieces, spot delivery to factory. Shashi cotton $40,000 - Yong'an factory imports 100 pieces, again, again.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Cloth Exchange, upon the instruction of the Ministry of Finance, will implement the new system of weights and measures from February 1 of this year. Therefore, the trading of July futures cotton is temporarily suspended. As a result, it did not list for business today.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market initially fell due to pressure from sellers, and then rebounded due to buying and short-covering. As a result, spot prices rose by 5 basis points, and futures prices rose by 4-5 basis points. Liverpool cotton spot prices fell by 2 points, and futures prices rose by 2 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 3 points. The Bombay cotton market initially rose due to speculative buying, and then fell due to hedging. As a result, Pingar fell by 7.5 jiao, Ormla rose by 0.5 rupee, and Baroche rose by 1 rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram from the 31st):</p>

<h3 id="e225">Grain: Longs Active in Forward Flour in the Afternoon <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the prices of each month were generally flat and consolidated. The quotation for foreign wheat in Chicago fell by about 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. Therefore, after the initial opening, although the market atmosphere was stable, the market sentiment became tired as the factories slightly sold this month. Forward prices were also flat as buyers were powerless. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, this month's prices were consolidating and slightly improved, because the factories did not move and the buyers absorbed. Forward prices were also stable due to off-market long activity. In terms of actual sales, there was still little development. It was only heard that brokers had bought 10,000 bags of navy flour at a price of 2.2 yuan. It is not yet certain whether it was purchased by Tianjin. This month and March remained unchanged, April was better by 0.075 yuan, May was better by 0.05 yuan, June was better by 0.01 yuan, and July initially opened at 2.1325 yuan and closed better by 0.01 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e226">July Futures New Wheat Changed to New Measuring Instrument <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<h3 id="e227">Smaller Than the Old Instrument...Price Discounted by 82% <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning and afternoon, the prices of each month remained depressed and trading was scarce. Only recently it was rumored that a certain factory intended to buy and offered good prices, such as the opening prices in March, which were up to $4.12 in the morning and afternoon, an increase of 0.07 yuan compared to the beginning of the week. There were no other transactions. July new wheat traded quite smoothly in the morning and afternoon. However, the firm has implemented a new measuring instrument. It is reported that 500 dan has been changed to 600 dan, which is equivalent to one carload unit. The price is lowered because the new measuring instrument is smaller than the old measuring instrument, roughly at a discount of 82% (the exchange has not yet announced it). Therefore, the price also declined. The opening price was $3.12, and then immediately fell to a little over $3.08. The closing price was $3.10. This new measuring instrument is still new. Internal and external parties must pay attention. Spot prices were held firm because Fuxin and Xingtun were doing the remaining packages, with Shandong red wheat at $4.18, white wheat at $4.15, Taiwan wheat at $4.08 to $4.10, and Bengbu wheat at $4.05. There are few supplies in the market, and the situation looks stable.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Late Rice Bought 3,000+ Bags <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of goods from various groups was similar to before, still over 40 firms (over 6,000 shi), but late rice was relatively scarce, only ten or so firms. After an initial rush by Hakka merchants, the situation looked tighter. However, the bottom line relies on the goods from Sijing. These goods have been very scarce recently. With merchants rushing to grab them, they have all raised their prices, and the sellers have also taken the opportunity to make them more expensive. The late rice from various groups also rose in succession. The market situation was unusually lively at the time. Until the close of the market, statistics showed that the North and South Ocean groups together bought over 3,000 bags of remaining goods, and the prices were raised by nearly one chi. Although the hopes of solving the thick japonica of various groups in the North market are on the verge of success, it is still not easy to restore it, so the market sentiment here is as stable as usual, but the appetite is not as strong as it was a few days ago, and the market situation has therefore declined. Du Jian is still a fixed situation, Yang Jian is still outstanding, Bian Yuan has no gains or losses, and Yin Yuan is quite outstanding.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Over 60 firms of goods arrived. The appetite for various colors in the market is quite active. The market shape of white japonica, Yang Du, and Bu Jian are tighter. Bai Yuan and Yin Yuan have increased by a jiao or so. Early Bo rice is stable.</p>

<p>Northern Ocean Gang Suddenly Active: For two weeks, the Northern Ocean Hakka Gang's purchases of grain have been poor, resulting in few exports. Yesterday, they suddenly became active, and various customs declaration firms reserved space with shipping companies on behalf of customers. It is reported that within this week, there are already 100,000 bags of flour to be shipped to Tianjin.</p>
<p>Fuzhou Gang Handles Grain in Large Quantities: Since the Central Army recovered Fuzhou, the Hakka merchants of the Fujian Gang have purchased large quantities of miscellaneous grains after the Ministry of Transportation approved the resumption of services of Chinese ships. In addition to the previous ships that transported goods to Fujian, the Hengshan ship of the Three Northern Company went to Fujian yesterday, loaded with over 14,000 bags of white rice and over 9,000 bags of flour. Today, the Xinxing ship exported over 5,000 bags of white rice and about 7,000 bags of flour.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: The Factory Icing Sugar is Short and Prices are Firm</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was relatively stable. The Guild set the price for ordinary coarse sand white at $19.50, with no fluctuations. Transfer goods called for a rise of 0.1 yuan to $6.55, but no transactions were made. Dutch red high-quality goods called for $15.85. Taikoo Sugar B mark called for $20. Zhenyu No. 1 native factory white small sales fell by 0.1 yuan to $18.70. The native factory iced goods are short and quite firm. No. 1 ice is $23.10, and No. 2 ice is $22. Scattered openings on Chaoqing Road, with over 100 bags traded at prices of $11.60 to $11.30. Over 200 boxes of Sliced Qing were opened at a price of $8.50.</p>

<p>Since the price of wood ear fungus has rebounded, there has been a lot of activity here. The stock is short and the market price is increasing day by day. Yesterday, the trading floor called for $88 for higher-quality miscellaneous wood ear fungus and $85-$86 for ordinary quality, an increase of $4-$5 compared to before.</p>

<h3 id="e246">Two Enemies <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Han Sui</p>
<p>Love affairs should avoid triangles or more complex shapes because if the three parties are equally matched, it becomes a political situation like the Three Kingdoms, lasting for forty or fifty years. War is an even more remarkable thing, but every time I read the newspapers, "head-on assault" isn't so bad, but once it becomes "attacks from both sides," things go badly, with a certain number killed and wounded. Its harm is no less than a soldier's defection or a spy in front of a general. Love is like warfare, and warfare is like writing. A person who is new to writing will definitely discover two enemies: one in their heart and one at the tip of their pen.</p>
<p>Following one's own impulses, charging straight ahead, completely writing out what one wants to say, and if attacking something, certainly bringing the entire force together at the pen tip, like a single blow of a sharp blade, this should be the front line. At the same time, there must be concerns about gains and losses, conciliatory opinions, and feelings of compassion, hindering this pen tip, and this is also a front line. Since being born as a human, one can encounter battles everywhere. Where there is battle, there must arise two kinds of minds: advancing and retreating. Both advance and retreat are possible, and both harmony and war are viable. Only being neither harmonious nor at war is being caught in a pincer attack, the so-called being unable to command and unwilling to obey, which will surely lead to utter defeat, and this is common sense.</p>
<p>But true warriors must also fall into this kind of situation, like Gandhi, like Jesus—"Have compassion on them!" "God give me the power of peace!" Silently whispering—unable to bear the violence inflicted upon themselves, yet unwilling to inflict violence upon those who use violence. Although stemming from a broad mind, it will ultimately lead to great obstacles. This is an extremely high state, rare.</p>
<p>The remedy is to take oneself as the main subject and bring out true strength. Like a brave boxer, allowing ordinary people to hit him without retaliating because he feels the enemy is too small, tolerating him, like a wealthy man losing a small amount of money, not considering it a big deal. This is not failure; waiting until encountering a strong enemy to strike back; or remaining peaceful to the end, bearing crucifixion without complaint, not only not considering the enemy worth mentioning, but also not considering oneself too important. This requires greater strength, true skill. At that time, not only will a pincer attack be ineffective, but even an entire encirclement will fail; a triangle will transform into a congratulatory circle, with oneself casually becoming the center, and the circle will also be determined by oneself.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Remembering Mr. Du Yaquan <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Ke Shi</p>
<p>I saw the books written by Mr. Yaquan a long time ago, but I only got to know him about six or seven years ago. At this time, he was only in his fifties, but he was already very thin and old.</p>
<p>Mr. Yaquan loved to talk and loved to laugh. He didn't drink alcohol, but he loved to smoke. He often smoked "Black Girl Brand" cigarettes, which were rolled with brown paper and filled with dark brown tobacco. It is said that ordinary cigarettes often contain picric acid, but this kind of cigarette does not, and the taste is also good. Each conversation often involved various issues, scientific, social, or about the origin of mahjong. He rarely talked about personal matters, because he never calculated his own interests.</p>
<p>When Mr. Yaquan spoke, although his opinions often differed from others, his views were very clear. Once, he heard a speaker talk about the hard lives of people in some reformed countries, and he replied without hesitation:</p>
<p>"That is normal; it is normal for everyone to live a little frugally. It is an abnormal phenomenon when some people enjoy excessive material comforts while most people are starving!"</p>
<p>As he spoke, he nodded, and the smile at the end of his sentence would make the other person feel that their own judgment was inaccurate.</p>
<p>When Mr. Yaquan spoke, he was very concerned about the future of China. I heard such arguments several times: "The Chinese should urgently seek self-sufficiency. If they continue to be exploited by imperialism, the result will be unthinkable." Therefore, he did not like the comprador class, saying that consumer cooperatives should be established. He believed that as long as one explained with reason, one could definitely make it clear, so he later took over a school.</p>
<p>He often talked about this idea to his students, telling them not to become compradors, but the result of this preaching made him very discouraged. He once told me that although there were many good young people, some still dreamed of going to America. Mr. Yaquan was not against studying abroad, but he was afraid that they would not learn anything in America and would instead more easily become compradors.</p>
<p>The school eventually closed down, not entirely due to the discouragement of the organizer; the main reason was that the finances could no longer be sustained. In some schools, the bamboo shoots used in the students' meals were often green and about to turn into bamboo, and when water chestnuts were used, they often already had black spots. But Mr. Yaquan said that young people's food must have sufficient nutrients, so the food must be good. The kitchen said that it was easy to do, just add more money for food. So the money was added. There were many such things. So his several thousand yuan of savings were soon used up, and he had to close the school. But from this experience, he learned how difficult it was to explain a concept.</p>
<p>Soon, the January 28th Incident broke out. He walked out of the firing line, returned to his hometown, and continued to write books. By the summer vacation of last year, he had completed a dictionary of over 700,000 characters, which was written with the help of others. At the end of the summer vacation, he came to Shanghai, and this was my last meeting with him. At this time, he was even older and weaker. Although he still loved to talk, he did not laugh as much as before. While eating, he also told me many things about the countryside.</p>
<p>After that, he sent several more letters. Once, he told me that he had pneumonia, and after treatment, his life was probably no longer in danger, but he still needed to rest for a few days. However, not long after, I received a report from a friend saying that one night, he suddenly worried about many future problems, became too excited, stayed up all night, and the next day, his temperature increased again, and his illness became serious. He passed away on the 6th (last December).</p>
<p>The news came more than a month ago, but when I recall the past, Mr. Yaquan's voice, smile, and appearance are all as if they are right in front of me.</p>
<h3 id="e248">On Tao Yuanming <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Yun</p>
<p>Reading Cao Juren's article on painting in the "Free Talk" section of January 30th, there are some remarks about Tao Yuanming. I feel that Duke Tao has been wronged, so I would like to say a few words to correct Mr. Cao.</p>
<p>The original text says: "Although Tao Yuanming might 'cherish a good time and go alone, or plant a staff and weed the fields,' he ultimately 'ascends the east hill to whistle, and composes poems by the clear stream,' not associating with farmers. This kind of pastoral poet is like a white crane in the clouds, occasionally perching in the fields, but actually 'not knowing the difficulty of farming.'"</p>
<p>Yuanming was really a farmer, not just associating with farmers. After he "could not bend his waist for five pecks of rice," he returned to farming until his death. Because he read books and could write poems, he had "whistling" and "composing poems" in his spare time after labor. He had one more skill than ordinary farmers, so he used it for his own enjoyment, just like some laborers today who can hum a few lines of Erhuang opera. What distinguishes him from ordinary poets is precisely that he was a farmer. The parallel between "Tao Xie," "Tao Liu," and "Tao Wei" has always been superficial in writing. How can the lives of Kangle, Liuzhou, and Suzhou be compared to Tao's? Tao's drinking, like Tao's composing poems, was enjoyed only after physical labor. This kind of "enjoyment" is "rest," a rightful need of laborers. All counterfeit farmer poets of the past and present should not steal Duke Tao to compare themselves. Try reading the records about Tao and a volume of Yuanming's poems. His hard work, his stubbornness, his hunger, his poor joy—all jump before our eyes. We don't need to drop book bags, just a few poems that we usually read for fun, such as "Planting beans under the South Mountain, the grass is lush, and the bean seedlings are sparse. Rising early to manage the wasteland, carrying a hoe home by moonlight. The path is narrow, the grass and trees are long, and the evening dew wets my clothes…" "…Holding the plow, I rejoice in the seasonal tasks, turning my face to encourage the farmers… Although I have not measured the year's harvest, I am pleased with the matter at hand. Plowing and planting have their times of rest, and travelers do not inquire. At sunset, we return together, the pot of wine cheers the nearby neighbors…" "…Opening the spring to manage the usual business, the year's work is somewhat impressive… How can the farming family not be bitter? We cannot refuse this difficulty. The four limbs are truly tired, but hopefully, there will be no other troubles. Washing and resting under the eaves, a jug of wine dispels the exhaustion…" "…I only hope it will always be like this; manual labor is not something to sigh about." From these poems, we can see his self-portrait, making it impossible for us to deny that he was a farmer—just a farmer who could write poetry.</p>
<p>Yuanming was certainly a scholar in his youth. The reason why he eventually became a farmer is precisely the expression of his entire thought and personality. The society in which he lived had not yet produced Marx, and there was no awareness or emotion of class struggle. What he benefited from was entirely Confucian thought, expressing the spirit of true Confucianism. He was not without political understanding and ability. But he felt that if one's own behavior was not clean, "eating official rice," "the mind enslaved by the body," then it was fundamentally wrong. Such a person can never engage in politics; doing so would only add a few more corrupt officials. So he would rather till the fields himself, eating the harvest of his own labor. If the harvest was insufficient, suffering from hunger and cold, he would never change. He persisted until his death!</p>
<p>My friend Pan once had this to say about Tao: "Duke Tao's life has a completely consistent spirit. The personality displayed by his strong will is truly a tough, brave, ordinary, and great hero… He could not stand the pretentious and actually despicable atmosphere of the time, and he was unwilling to associate with it. He also did not want 'the mind to be enslaved by the body, greedy for the comfort of the mouth and body.' But in any case, clothing and food must be sought. Since he did not care about 'nibbling on the dregs,' he resolutely became a farmer until his death. This is Duke Tao's extraordinary knowledge, courage, and determination to see the truth and act accordingly. He established a completely consistent system of life on the simplest basis of 'self-labor to seek coarse clothes and plain food'…" (The full text can be found in last year's Beijing Sino-French University Monthly.)</p>
<p>I completely agree with what Pan said, so I quote it as an aid to discussing Tao.</p>
<p>(Postscript) I have never met Mr. Cao. But I often read his clear and vigorous writing in "Free Talk." I often imagine what he is like and admire him. Mr. Cao's article on painting only occasionally mentioned Yuanming in passing and does not occupy an important position in the full text. I mention this because "Free Talk" is not a profound and purely literary publication but a newspaper provided for the general reading public. Also, because what Mr. Cao said made me think of some political figures in China today who are annoying, I am happy to take advantage of Mr. Cao's passing remarks to talk a little about Yuanming. This may be of some benefit to the general public. It is not to criticize Mr. Cao's article. This goes without saying. It is precisely because it is not easy to speak today that I add this footnote.</p>
<h3 id="e249">Morning in the Countryside <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— He Deming</p>
<p>The morning in the countryside is clear and serene; dew like pearls hangs on the spider webs on the eaves; hangs on the honeylocust and cherry trees in front of the thatched cottage; hangs on the dandelions and foxtails on the grass mounds… The sun reveals its red face on the top of the eastern mountain, and its myriad rays pierce the thin purplish-brown misty coat. Sunlight shines through strings of dewdrops, shimmering like fireflies dancing by the lotus pond on summer nights.</p>
<p>"Little Blackie! Going to the fields so early?"</p>
<p>Uncle Wang is sunbathing on the grass mound, with a dry tobacco pipe in his mouth, speaking to a middle-aged farmer who is leading an ox and carrying a plow and rake.</p>
<p>"Uncle Wang, you're really early."</p>
<p>The middle-aged farmer smiled at Uncle Wang and hurried up the hillside.</p>
<p>"These days, everyone is diligent and hardworking, but the price of rice is falling so much that it's frightening. The price of grain is less than two yuan per load…"</p>
<p>Uncle Wang took a few hearty puffs of his pipe, spitting out circles of smoke, as if lamenting to himself. A black and white cat suddenly ran onto the grass mound. It ran to Uncle Wang's feet and rubbed against him, looking up at Uncle Wang with its eyes, meowing. Uncle Wang gently stroked its head and neck with his pipe, and it gradually became quiet, scratching itself with its own paws.</p>
<p>"Amao! Come quickly to Grandpa."</p>
<p>Uncle Wang stretched his voice and shouted towards the bottom of the grass mound. The crowd at the bottom of the grass mound was as chaotic as a play, with children fighting grass and playing hide-and-seek; middle-aged women picking bean sprouts and shredding radish; and several elderly women mending torn socks and those tattered clothes with a thousand holes…</p>
<p>"Grandpa! Grandpa!…"</p>
<p>Following Uncle Wang's shout, a child of about eight or nine years old ran up from the bottom of the grass mound like an arrow. The child climbed onto his lap, clinging to his sleeve with his left hand, reaching for his beard with his right hand, and shouting "Grandpa" without stopping.</p>
<p>"Amao! Is Grandpa good? Is Mom good?" "Grandpa is good! Grandpa is good!" "Where is Grandpa good?" "Grandpa tells me stories to listen to, gives me sand beans to eat, and roasts sweet potatoes for me…"</p>
<p>"Grandpa is so good, how about giving Grandpa a kiss?" "No! Grandpa has a beard, it will prick my mouth." "If you don't give Grandpa a kiss, Grandpa won't love you!" "Grandpa's beard is like wolfberries, it will prick my mouth!"</p>
<p>"Good Amao, my good Mao Tou, give Grandpa a kiss, please. Give Grandpa a kiss, good boy! Oh, that's a good boy! One more." "No more, it pricks my mouth!"</p>
<p>Amao slid down from Grandpa's lap, touched his mouth, and ran back down the grass mound like an arrow. Uncle Wang watched his grandson run away, picked up his pipe again, and took a deep puff, circles of smoke drifting into the air, drifting, drifting…</p>
<p>"Someone has a basket. If you borrow rice, they will even lend you the carrying pole and rope to carry it back home." "That's good!" "It's really true." Qin Da Niang's reply made Lian Di happy. Third Auntie avoided them, saying, "Qin Da Niang, you can just tell Lian Di what you need to say." "There's nothing to say. Once you're in the city, Lian Di, listen to Third Auntie." She then leaned close to her daughter's ear and said, "Don't forget to change your clothes." Lian Di only nodded, but didn't expect that she would really need to change any clothes. The sky outside had only just brightened a little. The sky was full of gray clouds, and a cold wind was blowing across the desolate fields and the declining village. Qin Da Niang stood on the earthen platform, looked up at the sky, and guessed that it wouldn't rain. In the distance, someone was already stooping over to look for wild vegetables.</p>
<p>Seeing the smiles of Lian Di and Third Auntie, she bravely let her daughter go, hoping that one day she would benefit from her daughter's success.</p>
<p>"Let's go into the city early." "Okay, go into the city with Third Auntie. Remember, listen to Third Auntie, and the clothes." So Lian Di left with Third Auntie with a smile. They said goodbye to each other and wished each other well. After walking a long way, Third Auntie turned her head and said, "I'll pick you up in the city in a while!" Lian Di also turned her head and said, "Mom, wait for me to bring rice home!" Lian Di's voice was full of laughter, and Qin Da Niang could still see her daughter's happy posture in the distance. She turned and entered the door, and grief immediately struck. Her tears streamed down. It was as if a part of her body had suddenly been lost. She couldn't let her daughter go, mourning and blaming herself. She wanted to chase after her immediately and call her daughter back. She immediately stepped out of the threshold, only to see her daughter's figure gradually shrinking. She finally didn't have the courage to utter a single word. She cried sadly, but her daughter had left, and her daughter's figure remained in her heart. That smile before leaving. After a long time, no one comforted her, and she stopped crying, sobbing, with two swollen red eyes, carrying a small broken bamboo basket and a rusty iron shovel, and habitually walked out of the door, preparing to pick wild vegetables.</p>
<p>On the ridges, she looked up at the sky and muttered to herself:</p>
<p>"Why isn't there any sun yet?" (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e250">On "Selling Writing for a Living" <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— A Tan</p>
<p>In the second half of 1934, "The Writers' Group" launched an "attack" on "critics." Starting in 1934, Mr. Shen Congwen launched an attack on "Shanghai School" writers in the north (Tianjin), and Mr. Cao Juren gave him a strong answer, explaining that both the "Beijing School" and the "Shanghai School" should be swept away, and that between the two, it was better to be "Shanghai" than "Beijing."</p>
<p>In summary, the biggest accusation of Mr. Shen Congwen and others against the Shanghai School writers was "commercial competition." The so-called "commercial competition" here includes many things, but it reminds me of the matter of writers "selling writing for a living." "Selling writing for a living" translated into colloquial language is "writing to eat."</p>
<p>Originally, "writing to eat" is as proper as working to eat. Articles are essentially commodities. If they want to write something more meaningful and progressive, it's like a pharmacy selling cod liver oil and not selling arsenic. Of course, they may have other intentions besides making money, but this is just like a pharmacy owner who has the purpose of helping the world in addition to making money. Helping the world still doesn't prevent making money.</p>
<p>It is wrong for pharmacy owners to manufacture arsenic and aphrodisiacs just to make money. If the things that writers write are not feudal or erotic things written just to make money, then there is nothing wrong with them.</p>
<p>Almost every one of Dostoevsky's novels was forced out to repay debts or to make money to eat, but Dostoevsky is still the greatest realist writer in the world. So whether or not an article sells for money is irrelevant. What is important is whether the writer betrays his own ideas and the essence of art—truth—for money. What writers create through labor deserves wages or compensation.</p>
<p>But today, people are attacking people for "writing to eat," and those who are attacked are blushing and desperately trying to hide it. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>In short, this is the relationship of awareness between the attacker and the attacked. Although they are standing in opposing positions, they have a common view that literature is noble and making money is vulgar. For a literary author to write articles and sell them for money is decadence. Any article written to make money is not a good article. Therefore, the attacker finds that the attacked writes articles to eat, as if they have discovered the other party's conspiracy and secrets, and raises it righteously. And the person being attacked seems to have really been discovered of a conspiracy and secrets, feeling anxious. The more you hide it, the more you feel that writing to eat is shameful, and the more advantageous it is for others to use this point to attack you. Of course, among those who hide their writing to eat, there must be those who betray their own ideas and the essence of art—truth—in order to make money, but these people are not within the scope of my discussion.</p>
<p>People who attack writing to eat generally have another profession. Let's not say that his reliance on that profession to eat is no different from writing to eat, but even the articles they write will never refuse royalties just because they have another profession. To put it bluntly, that article attacking others for writing to eat is written for royalties, or even for the sake of royalties.</p>
<p>We have long heard the famous saying "literature is useless." Now that articles can only be exchanged for food, it is already very miserable. (Of course, I am not saying that articles can secure the country and stabilize the people.) Moreover, with the storm of recession sweeping across, those who write to eat are about to "not even be full of the west wind." Adding to this the ridicule of those who don't write to eat, those who write to eat really only have one way out—to complain. If complaining is also writing to eat, then the only thing left to do is to starve to death. It is:</p>
<p>"Searching for chapters and picking sentences, old carving insects, the dawn moon hangs the jade bow against the curtain; not seeing the overflowing sea year after year, where does the article call the autumn wind?"</p>
<h3 id="e251">Seeing a Friend Off Southward <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Hui Ren</p>
<p>A sadness like mist wraps around my whole body.</p>
<p>With a lost heartscape, I tread with a dispirited pace from a corner of the city to see you off southward.</p>
<p>The river wind roars hoarsely over the waves, and blowing against my face and hands is so cold, like needles pricking my empty heart. That yellow steamboat, black smoke rings, and silver sky have been winking at me, and I have been gazing at them so greedily, wanting to carve them in my brain forever and ever, like a lover being separated.</p>
<p>The people are hysterical and noisy, as excited as soldiers going to the battlefield. I can only squeeze quietly into the crowd. Obviously, I don't have their joy, I am just so depressed, so sad.</p>
<p>I know I shouldn't show anything inauspicious when you're leaving. I've put on a mask and put on hypocrisy, calling out to you, but my hand is trembling so much, my heart is so bitter, I wish I could cry in your arms, but this expression of true emotion is said by some to be shameless and ridiculous; alas, how cruel society is!</p>
<p>But, you won't let sadness occupy your mindscape, you are happy and bright, like lovely spring light. These things, your eyes have told me. Of course, you should be happy, because you are about to fall back into the embrace of your hometown. At that time, your parents will smile at you, your brothers will greet you, and your little nephew will act coquettishly towards you. You will run into the valley to relive the fun after parting, and you will also breathe the fragrance of your hometown in the morning air, and you will also tell your family members about your feelings after separation.</p>
<p>Yes, you are happy, and I bless you, you will definitely blow the sea breeze of the East Sea carefree on the black night of your journey, and comfortably make sweet and fragrant dreams.</p>
<p>I will not be jealous of you, although I am somewhat reluctant for you to go south. Originally, I am not qualified to be your friend, I only have a lonely fate to live in a dark room and complain; I also only have a wandering fate, and soon I will leave this cursed city — Shanghai</p>
<p>I bless you, friend, may your journey be as bright as morning dew!</p>
<p>I bless you, girl, may your beauty be as beautiful as a rose, forever!</p>
<h3 id="e252">Night <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Zaimang</p>
<p>Night snatched away dusk, like a devil taking away a faint life; without resistance, without groaning, it, the dark night, occupied everything in space.</p>
<p>Look! This is the backstage of the drama stage of life.</p>
<p>Beauty may be ugliness, and hideous faces reveal more veins, all taking advantage of the night's cover to become active and dance! Night is mysterious to some!</p>
<p>"Come! Wine! Meat! Let's be wild! Let's get drunk! We have plenty of lust, and we also have plenty of money! Let's enjoy ourselves as much as possible! Before dawn replaces the night!"</p>
<p>However...</p>
<p>The multifaceted night revolves and revolves, grinding out overflowing wine foam, and at the same time grinding out the blood of life!</p>
<p>The clown put away his smile, only in the deep night does he caress his pain!</p>
<p>For the sake of life, they cut off pieces of their own flesh and sell them to people who are also "human beings"! That bloody smile!</p>
<p>During the day, excessive labor is not enough to keep them from being hungry, so at night, they have to sacrifice sleep! Work! Work! Is that result really for their own lives?</p>
<p>How many people whipped by society are twisting their brains in this long night!</p>
<p>Night! Why do you only give sweet dreams to some people, and trample the unfortunate even further under your feet? But, when the sun, like clear water, rises, where will you hide?</p>

<p>— Maifu</p>
<p>Many foreigners do not know how to eat with Chinese chopsticks, and this is a fact. However, if you tell the villagers, they will not believe it. Many noble ladies and wives do not know how to use the rural outhouses. If you tell the people in the city, I'm afraid they won't believe it either. But this is also a fact.</p>
<p>Foreigners don't know how to use Chinese chopsticks because they haven't used them before, so that's why. Conversely, those ladies who don't know how to use rural outhouses are the same; they only use Western porcelain flush toilets, and when they see the simple wooden outhouses in the countryside, they will naturally panic.</p>
<p>Originally, things that have not been used, or things that have been abandoned for a long time, are difficult to use. For example, many high officials, having been away from their hometown for a long time, can't even speak the local dialect, which is the same principle. Because high officials also come from the countryside, but after all, they speak official language more often. In this way, people naturally evolve, and as a result, they readily abandon the unglamorous and unattractive local accent, which is only right and proper.</p>
<p>Although before there were porcelain toilets, ladies also had to use outhouses, but after all, that was the ladies of that time. This cannot be generalized. Every era has its own civilization, and every era has its own enjoyment. Therefore, when ordinary delicate ladies approach the dark and dirty outhouses in the countryside, they scream娇滴滴 (jiaodidi, a term for delicate and affected behavior) and are at a loss, which is probably right and proper.</p>
<h3 id="e254">Development of Contradictions <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Chen</p>
<p>Social scientists tell us that social phenomena are constantly in contradiction, and social evolution progresses step by step in contradiction. Therefore, contradiction is an element of evolution. Where there is contradiction, there is evolution. To seek evolution, one must also be based on contradiction. This has become a "law" of all changes in social affairs. China is scarred all over, riddled with wounds, and conflicts and contradictions are everywhere. Naturally, in this extreme "contradiction," applying this law will surely have extraordinary "development." Examining reality, there is indeed evidence to be found. However, China has "unique national conditions" and a unique environment, and its development and evolution must have its own "unusual" path.</p>
<p>Let's not talk about the future of the country and the fate of the nation, but only about the "unimportant" folk customs. Every time the electric lights are first lit and the neon lights shine, when we arrive at the central area of this Oriental Paris, we see that on both sides of the asphalt road, there are</p>
<p>迎風鹄立 (ying feng hu li, standing tall against the wind), lining up in formation, waiting for the opportunity to spread to people; and the towering hotels and many alleys and apartments also open the "doors of convenience" for those who buy a night of pleasure. Just counting within a day in Shanghai, in all of this, it is not known how many "germ" seeds are spread to many balcony guests. But if you take another glance at the street, there are countless hospitals and clinics with signs like "Specializing in gonorrhea and leucorrhea," "Guaranteed cure, never recurring," lined up one after another, fluttering in the wind. This phenomenon is naturally unavoidable "contradiction," but it can develop. The more "么二长三" (yao er chang san, a Shanghai dialect term for prostitutes), the more prosperous the venereal disease treatment business.</p>
<p>Furthermore, like "燕子窠" (yanzi ke, literally "swallow's nest," a term for opium dens), which are filled with addicted people day and night, its business is booming and its profits are a hundred times greater, which is far beyond what the "tightening" of the people's livelihoods can be compared to. However, when you penetrate this cloud-swallowing, fog-spitting atmosphere, there are small flyers and advertisements for "quitting smoking" and "blood purifying agents," and large, solemn prohibitions. This opposite fact must also be acknowledged as somewhat contradictory, but it can develop in contradiction. The stricter the ban, the further it is from a manifestation of the elimination of "雲土" (yuntu, slang for opium) and "人頭土" (rentoutu, more explicit slang for opium), and "寓禁於徵" (yu jin yu zheng, using prohibition to collect taxes) precisely illustrates the fact that under the "prohibition," general "elegant rooms" and "places for heart-to-heart talks" can greatly develop. On the surface, they are extremely conflicting, but in reality, they complement each other.</p>
<p>This kind of bizarre spectacle has become a special "unusual" way of contradictory development in Chinese social affairs. The so-called "development of contradiction" usually refers to the replacement of old conservative forces by new progressive forces in conflicts and defeats full of holes. However, the development of various social phenomena in China in contradiction is an increase in two opposing "contradictions." It is not "development of contradiction," but "developing contradictions."</p>
<p>Speaking of the root cause of China's poverty, as long as it is not concealed, everyone admits that it is endless infighting and civil war for years, and the reason why civil war occurs is that each side holds its own troops and guards its territory, claiming kingship. Therefore, China's large number of soldiers and courage in internal warfare are almost in an "contradictory" position with the phenomenon of national weakness, which cannot coexist. But because of the special "national conditions," the more impoverished it is, the more internal warfare and soldiers there are. The more wars and troops there are, the more impoverished China becomes. This "contradiction" has never been replaced by a new force and still becomes a "developing" phenomenon.</p>
<p>If you want to eliminate the phenomenon of "潇湘馆" (Xiaoxiang Pavilion, a residence in the novel Dream of the Red Chamber, often associated with elegance and sorrow) and "怡红院" (Yihong Courtyard, also from Dream of the Red Chamber, a place for entertainment with women) coexisting with hospitals for gonorrhea and leucorrhea, you must make a "ten-year-long Yangzhou dream" of repentance. To avoid the spectacle of hibiscus flowers everywhere and prohibitions all over the sky, you must also take a few "戒辟丸" (jiebi wan, pills for quitting bad habits). To save the morbid state of parallel development of poverty and war, if you feel that spiritual "sudden repentance" and internal "膏丹丸散" (gao dan wan san, medicinal pastes, pills, and powders) are ineffective, then I am afraid that there is only the method of surgery.</p>

<h3 id="e255">Bride Kidnapping <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I was introduced by friends and relatives to be engaged to a Mr. Wang, but we have not yet married. Now I hear that he does not intend to have a formal wedding, but wants to practice the vulgar custom of "bride kidnapping." Although my knowledge is shallow, I cannot help but feel resentful towards bride kidnapping. Therefore, I do not want to marry him. I want to publish a statement in the newspaper to dissolve the engagement and not be subject to this kind of restriction. However, I do not know if there are any regulations on this in the law. Therefore, I have written this letter to request a detailed answer. With respect, Li Shihao</p>
<p>Editor's note: "Bride kidnapping" is indeed an evil custom, and it is not recognized in law. You can dissolve the engagement because the other party wants to carry out bride kidnapping. Of course, we oppose this evil custom of "bride kidnapping"; however, this is only an illegal marriage procedure, and it is not that the other party is treating you badly. Therefore, we believe that you can temporarily not ask about the procedures for dissolving the engagement. You can now first think about whether you are willing to become a lifelong partner with the other party. If you are willing, then you should not dissolve the engagement. You can issue a warning to the other party, stating that you are determined not to accept "bride kidnapping" and not let him fantasize. But if the other party really cannot hold a grand wedding ceremony, then you should also forgive him and not be too demanding, and let him hold a simple wedding ceremony. If the other party can listen to this method, wouldn't it be much more satisfactory than "dissolving the engagement"? Of course, this method is based on the premise that "you are willing to marry him." If you do not love him and do not want to marry him, then it is best to dissolve the engagement.</p>
<p>"Dissolving the engagement" requires considerable legal procedures, and it cannot be done by publishing a statement in the newspaper. You should ask a lawyer about this issue.</p>
<p>Finally, we have a few words to say about "bride kidnapping."</p>
<p>The evil custom of "bride kidnapping" should also be eliminated, but we should also study the reasons for the occurrence of "bride kidnapping" and find ways to eliminate it. The main reason why "bride kidnapping" occurs is probably that the man's family is in economic difficulty and cannot hold a grand wedding ceremony. Of course, "marriage" is an extremely important and meaningful event in life. In theory, the "wedding ceremony" should be very elaborate, and relatives and friends should all be invited to have a lively celebration. However, for this reason, the level of expenses required for general "marriage" has been raised very high, so that among the people who disregard social disapproval, they practice "bride kidnapping" or other methods to avoid this difficulty. Those who love face borrow debts from all over the place and barely hold a wedding, which is a tragedy. People who marry by "bride kidnapping" will only often be ridiculed and mocked by others. People who marry by borrowing debts suffer unspeakable hardships. After marriage, they have to repay a large number of debts, and at the same time, the family's daily expenses are also greater than before. The number of people who feel economically panicked and oppressed throughout their lives because of marriage is countless. On the other hand, there are also things like late marriage and not marrying due to economic difficulties, but this is not a good solution either. Spending less money and incurring less debt on marriage is the right way. Therefore, we now very much advocate the "simplification" and "economization" of wedding ceremonies, hoping that in the future, we will no longer "bury the pain of a lifetime of enduring阴霾 (yinmai, haze, gloom)" in a joyous ceremony filled with guests and joy.</p>

<p>— Daini</p>
<p>Kejia suddenly raised his head, rubbing his eyelids, not believing that he had seen the wrong person, and asked in surprise, "Eh! You..."</p>
<p>"Sleeping so soundly, where were you last night?" the woman asked sarcastically.</p>
<p>"Don't tease, it's all because of little brother," Kejia pointed to Xiaoxun and explained, then asked, "Did you just arrive in Shanghai today too?"</p>
<p>"It's my sister's wedding." Before he could finish speaking, he smiled beautifully at Xiaoxun. Although Xiaoxun was meeting her for the first time, he knew that she was Jingyi's older sister, Jingwen. Naturally, Jingwen was also familiar with the name Zhu Xiaoxun. However, "little brother," that strange and inappropriate title, she did not expect that it would be this brother-in-law's old friend. Xiaoxun understood what she meant and acted shy. "Ha." Without losing his wild bull nature, he punched himself,</p>
<p>"Introduced his sister's 'sister,' Hu Jingwen."</p>
<p>After a crude introduction, he began his speech:</p>
<p>"At the end of last year, I forced little brother to come to Hangzhou to recuperate, at least half of it was his own volition. I am often unable to deal with this wild horse that has broken free of its reins. Recently, he wrote a letter that was like a complaint, so I specially came to Hangzhou to invite him to Shanghai. Jingwen, do you know what he said?" He paused, seemingly waiting for the two to answer. "He wanted to come to Shanghai after my wedding, because he | couldn't bear to see a woman. Haha."</p>
<p>"Mr. Zhu, is that true?" Naturally, the teasing story made Jingwen suspicious. Xiaoxun smiled helplessly, shaking his naturally curly hair. "Is it not true?" He straightened his back, looking like a real athlete. "Then, who is that woman?" "It's your classmate, Xu Qinbo." "What's so unbearable about seeing her?" "Ask little brother." Xiaoxun nervously glared at Kejia. If possible, he would immediately return to Hangzhou. In front of a woman, he could neither show off his skin, nor was he afraid that the innocent Jingwen would ask, "Mr. Zhu, what exactly is going on?" He admittedly failed to pick out a book from his briefcase, avoiding the other person's gaze.</p>
<p>As for Kejia, although he was honest and unceremonious, he also knew that in this situation, he could not make Zhu Xiaoxun the focus of the conversation. He coughed a few times to clear his throat and changed the subject.</p>
<p>"Jingwen, did you receive her letter?" "The letter was received early..." A clever woman, she understood everything, her attitude became very serious. "The school didn't have a suitable substitute teacher for a while, and finally the principal took over temporarily, so I was finally able to get away today. I want to find a job in Shanghai next semester. My sister is married, so I can't marry my mom too..."</p>
<p>Xiaoxun laughed as he listened. He casually closed the novel that he had been flipping through on the first page. Kejia seized the opportunity to take out a cigarette, which finally broke the gloomy situation.</p>
<p>The three people smoked cigarettes, scattering them into the March spring breeze, gently.</p>
<p>The car body shook leisurely, a sharp whistle sounded, and slowly drove into Fengjing Station. Kejia raised his fat palm and reached out the window to grab a vendor. Xiaoxun, as if he had gotten an opportunity, leaned behind Kejia and said, "My sister likes to eat Fengjing pig trotters, buy a few baskets to take with you."</p>
<p>The wild bull had already picked up four baskets, he didn't taste Xiaoxun's words carefully, another teasing!</p>
<p>"Little brother, when did your mom give birth to little sister?"</p>
<p>"My sister's 'sister' Hu Jingyi." He smiled victoriously, shaking his naturally curly hair. "In that case, my mom didn't | didn't get married together with my sister." Nervous laughter, innocent laughter, unnatural smiles, burying all sorrow behind joy.</p>
