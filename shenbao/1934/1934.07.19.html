<h3>軍事敎育與微兵制度</h3>
<p>— 敬</p>
<p>自世界第一次大戰後。軍國民敎育運動。嘗一度爲和平聲浪所淹沒·。然時至今日。各國莫不競尙軍備第二次之大屠殺。吾人處列强環伺之下。喪地辱國之秋。决不能袖手作壁上觀。冀倖免戰禍於萬一也。最近中央軍事及敎育當局。督捉各地高中以上學校。實行暑期軍訓。聞其目的在養成學生界整齊嚴肅之團體生活。矯正浪漫放蕩之不良習慣。洵爲切要之圖。良以我國個人與歐美人士相比較。德智才能。未見多讓。獨一旦作集團生活。便往往至望塵莫及。日人譏我爲未成形之近代國家。其理由卽在不惯於團體活動一點。吾人反躬自省。能不愧作。軍事訓練旣爲養成紀律化的團體生活之良法。苟能施行得當。自足變化靑年之氣質。而予民族前途以莫大之裨益也。所可惜者。署期軍訓。爲期太促。容能就形式上予若干靑年以軍隊生活之印象。究未有移風易俗之效力。而况課程敎材。亦太偏於刻板式的灌输而缺之精神上的啟迪。至學生階級以外之一般社會。更若置身於另一世界。直不知軍事訓練爲何物。此與旣住將推廣敎育一事限於少數學校之流弊。殆相仿佛。當考其故。則以我國施行募兵制度。軍民之問。鴻溝劃然。乃至此耳。然在募兵制度下之我國軍隊。旣無視役期間之限制。宜可技術純熟紀律良好矣。乃竟亦大謬不然。良以一般國民經濟之落後。軍需給養之困難。所謂兵者。衣</p>
<p>食且慮不周。更何有於道德之涵養。知識之充實。大勢所趨。民衆固不以軍人爲尊貴。軍人亦不願與民衆相合作。其下焉者。且公然魚肉人民。釀成中國特有之兵災。是以募兵制度不改革。縱有享受短期軍事訓練之學生。亦何足以影響一般國民對於軍人之態度。　問當自思我國國民所以缺乏集團生活之素養。募兵制度。與有關係。欲圖補救。自非實施徵兵制度不可。不觀乎當世强國。如德如日如蘇聯。皆爲徵兵國家。故其軍國民敎育之推進。可以名副其實。其敎育精神之表顯於平時者。爲有秩序。重公德。表顯於戰時者。爲受命。令守紀律。我國地大人衆。本易流於散漫。千百年來。復未經此種嚴格之訓練。遂致大敵當前。仍不克羣策羣力而作全力之抵抗。懲前毖後。能不感奮。或者曰。英美兩國。不但未行徵兵制。且未當作軍國民敎育之標榜。然其國力强大。民衆亦一般熟習於集團生活者。何耶。答曰。此因盎格魯撤遜民族。久蒙民主主義之寢淫。學校敎育之薰陶。故不待軍國民敎育之灌輸。已能瞭解國家與國民之關係。及其本身應盡之責任。固非其他民族可以同日而語也。　言夫徵兵制之優點。其特適於我國國情者凡二。第。一可以藉此訓練國民。使軍權軍令歸於一統。任何地方皆無從蓄養私。兵以為少數人之爪牙。第二。入伍士兵。新陳瓜代。現役期滿。則退歸預備役。若干年後。可使全國皆兵。無復軍民之分。一朝國家有事。動員令下。卽可隨地集合。共赴國難。不致再蹈過去之覆轍不過據今日情勢。以推測將來之戰爭。决非純恃兵力可以有濟。現代各國莫不應用最新穎之科學智識。最完密之組織才能。及最高限度之天然富源。以從事於戰爭。我國之科學技能與產業。旣已落後。而人民又缺乏適當之組織與訓練。縱然學得徵兵制之皮毛。决不足以操勝算。又有進者。吾人猜度中央之心理。或者欲藉學校軍訓爲中心。逐漸推行徵兵制於全國。若然。則竊恐此路迂緩。成效難期。吾人固承認軍訓一事。施行適當。確能予學校青年以良好之鍜鍊而間接造福於國家。然爲着手準備徵兵制起見。則應另闢蹊徑至少宜就現有之商團鄉團等民間武力。加以嚴格之訓練與積極之推廣。不然。若任令佔全國人口百分之八十以上之農民。赤手空拳。無以自衛·而獨寄重望於極少數之靑年學生。則尙非根本之策也。</p>

<h3>第二特院續審　顔魯卿被控索詐案　陳霆銳孫祖基陳述當時之情形　檢察官主張採取證人之言爲斷　｜昨已辯論終結定廿三日宣判｜</h3>
<p>律師顔魯卿、前因代表薛邁羅會計師事務所買辦周景賡在第二特院指控瑞昌順五金店主張祖明·莊源大糟坊小主莊繼孟·五金跑街汪連友·大德醫院院長唐慶岳·等行刦巨欵、並附追私訴、當於開庭審理時、因唐慶岳之辯護律師孫祖基·陳霆銳·陳述顔律師會向唐慶岳之父唐文壽索詐二千元、因此由王檢察官函請法捕房警務處在第二特院刑庭、向顔律師提起公訴、以刑法第三七○條、</p>
<h3>恐嚇詐財</h3>
<p>罪起訴、各情已誌前報、昨又續審、於九點半時、由熊彚萍推事偕同陳備三首席檢察官升坐第一刑庭、先訊證人陳霆銳稱、業律師、於六月二十日、唐家打電話請我加人代理唐慶岳爲辯護律師、於是我於四時至孫祖基律師事務所、當見唐慶岳之父文壽在會客室內、而顔律師·孫律師·及周景賽在另一客室內談話、移時孫律師與唐文壽向我言稱、說他們要錢、當余以此事係</p>
<h3>非法已極</h3>
<p>意欲囑唐報告捕房、乃唐文壽深恐投鼠忌器、故未報告、其時余卽向顔·周·二人言曰、做律師的不應知法犯法、唐慶岳確有盜匪行爲、法庭自有裁判他們、又說如有錢就無事、否則開庭時、以四人咬定唐是强盜、余又說那未我不做辯護律師、改爲證人地位、你們何以咬他、顔說那你沒有證據、至此、余就離去、惟在霞飛路爭執時、顔實下車與孫律師談話、官問顔律師曰、你聽見他言詞否、顔答、二十日那天、我未曾到過孫律師處、余前在高二分院辦一遺產案、第一審是陳律師所辦、而遭失敗、第二審由我接辦、當被訪事員</p>
<h3>送登各報</h3>
<p>因此陳律師見而不滿意、今日之話、完全虛僞、恐以前之怨嫌、官問陳律師是否以前有此怨恨、陳答、余與顔素無恩怨、辦案事實有之、至此、又訊證人黃星仲稱、我在霞飛路設立星星摩登服裝店、上月二十一日、潘洪鼎偕孫律師等前來、託我代唐慶岳擔保、官問、你看見他們如何情形、黃答、目見孫律師向潘洪鼎用英語言說二千元、答應不答應、又見孫律師與後面汽車中</p>
<h3>二人爭吵</h3>
<p>約二三分鐘、但被告顔魯卿並未下車、官命傳孫祖基到案、問曰當爾在霞飛路星星服裝店門前與潘洪鼎所說什麼話、孫答、未會說過、官又問、你再想想看、究竟說過什麼話、或用英語向潘說過否、至此、孫忽答稱、是的、會用英語說過二千元一語、潘先生恐不諳英語的、至此、法官謂曰、你所說之言、何以前後不符、先問你說不知、後問你又說有的、孫稱、因當時甚爲忽忙、我並呌潘先生與顔談話的、官又問周景賽曰、你在霞飛路服装店、與孫律師談話否、周答、我坐汽車、經過該處、由孫律師招呼我與他談話、他說唐之家屬、願以二千元</p>
<h3>了結私訴</h3>
<p>乃顔律師始終未與談話、又訊證人湯良貴稱、我在四川路四九號樓下設立上海西菜社、二十一日顔律師午時晚間均在我店吃飯、而周景賽亦偕三人後來共餐、並簽字爲證、至此、官命開始辯論、先據捕房律師姚肇弟稱、本案被告顔魯卿之罪責、由事實與法理講之、當另案開審時、由孫祖基律師與陳霆銳律師所舉發、後由檢察官函請警務處起訴、關於顔是否要索及爲他人要索、</p>
<h3>抑或帮助</h3>
<p>要索、訊之被告、始終否認、雖由證人證明、是否合符、或有矛盾處、案以三七○條起訴、但恐嚇並無逹到確定證實、倘鈞院欲採取各證之詞、則應以三六三條起訴、請求依法辦理、繼由顔魯卿辯稱、二十日孫祖基·秦道元·二人前來我處、因被我推出門外、於是孫律師以爲平生第一次奇恥大辱、故懷恨在心、一則利用此點、欲使其當事人無罪、對於陳律師已經前詞說明、上次開庭、孫律師說我</p>
<h3>到處要錢</h3>
<p>而以魯卿是小孩看待我、想我决不致如此發瘋、惟我平時鹵莽得罪他人則有之、查二十日唐慶岳拘解第一特院時、由張祖明證明行刦時唐慶岳站立門外、且於二十一日在捕房時、證人亦未指出何能說二十三庭訊時、咬定爲盜、對此恐嚇一層、無從說起、致於詐財一節、余始終會到塲、根本不知、請宣告無罪、又據陳檢察官起而發表意旨略謂顔魯卿是否搆成刑事、而事實須證明顔是否要索二千元、如果要錢的事實、不問</p>
<h3>錢之用途</h3>
<p>不過在此盜案沒有開始辯論前要錢、在法律上確有搆成三七○條之罪、是無問題、本檢察官亦以爲採取各證人證言爲斷云、官問唐文壽謂曰、對於你之私訴部份如何、唐答、私訴部份要求撤回、顔魯卿稱、余尙有一點補充、查孫祖基身爲律師、且當過法官、旣認爲不合法要索、何以情願將欵交付與周景賽、可見此欵完全償還私訴、並非索詐、繼由代理律師王士宗·張善樂·代爲辯護一切、熊推事論以辯論終結、定於七月二十三日宣判、</p>

<h3>來件　鐵路運輸的三大使命</h3>
<p>（二十三年七月十六日本局招待各業）</p>
<p>—吳副局長代表鐵道部業務司兪司長致辭—</p>
<p>本局今日招待各行商代表·本人奉鐵道部業務司兪司長電囑代表致辭。</p>
<p>本人覺得兪司長自到任兩年以來，對於鐵路運輸業務，秉承顧部長意旨，殫心竭力，積極辦理，而希望逐步貫澈者，綜有三項：（一）負責運輸；（二）整個運輸；（三）有效運輸。</p>
<p>（一）負責運輸的意義與設施以往鐵路對於貨運，老實說，只有用車輛往來搬送罷了。除了搬送以外，旁的一點不管，客商怎能滿意？兪司長見到此點，認爲鐵路要取得客商信仰，發展業務，非從實行貨物負責運输不可。所謂負責，就是不但搬送，還要負責保管，如有損失，負責賠償，使客商把貨物交付鐵路之後，自已不擔什麽心事。其已往設施的經過，大致如下：</p>
<p>（甲）京滬滬杭甬兩路自二十一年九月一日起，照預定計劃，開辦主要大站貨物負責運輸；至十一月一日，全路各站完全實行。</p>
<p>（乙）津浦路自二十一年九月一日起，先把浦口至徐州一叚開辦貨物負責運輸；至十一月一日，全路各站完全實行。</p>
<p>（丙）平漢路自二十一年一月一日起，先挑十五個大站，開辦貨物負責運輸；十一月十六日，全路各站開辦零担貨物負責運輸；二十三年一月，連整車貨物一併實行。</p>
<p>（丁）南潯路自二十一年十月二十起，全路辦理貨物負責運輸。</p>
<p>（戊）隴海路自二十一年十二月一日起，開辦主要各站貨物負責運輸，嗣即全路實行。</p>
<p>（已）北寗路於十九年先挑主要各站開辦貨物負責運輸；至二十一年九月一日，關内全叚全部實行。</p>
<p>（庚）膠濟路早在德國管理時期開辦負責貨運；我國收回以後，仍照此辦理。嗣後照部定計劃，澈底實行。</p>
<p>（辛）平綏路自二十三年六月一日起，全綫各站一律實行整車貨物負責運輸。</p>
<p>這是辦理貨物負責運輸的一段史略。不但如此，在最近之將來，還要辦理貨運保險，就是原來規定鐵路承運貨物遇有意外損失，如火廢之類，不予賠償者，實行保險以後，也照值賠償。不但貨物，還要辦理旅客保險。最近復令各路實行負責運輸六等貨物。推其旨趣，無非是要做到完全的負責，澈底的負責。</p>
<p>（二）整個運輸的意義與設施實行負責運輸，實在還不過發揮鐵路一部分的使命。巳往鐵路運送客貨，僅從這一站送到那一站，旁的一槪不管。所以這一路的車輛，是不走那一路的；這一路的行車時刻，是不與那一路相銜接的。並且出發站對於客貨怎樣送來，一槪不問；到逹站對於客貨怎樣轉往各處，也一槪不問。此種情形，客商又怎能滿意？兪司長見到這一點，認爲鐵路運輸，應該是整個的，不應該是割裂的，所以有下列的設施：</p>
<p>（甲）舉辦全國鐵路貨物負責聯運，其經過情形如左：</p>
<p>二十一年十月一日起，京滬滬杭甬兩路與津浦路開辦貨物負責聯運，先辦整車貨物；至十二月一日起，併辦零担貨物負責聯運，且不限貨物種類。</p>
<p>二十二年七月一日起，京滬滬杭甬兩路與杭江路開辦貨物負責聯運。</p>
<p>二十三年十一月一日起，全國各路一律辦理貨物負責聯運，先挑主要大站，嗣後陸續推廣，現巳全部實行。（惟平綏路於二十三年六</p>
<p>月二十日起，先挑十六站，辦理貨物負責聯運。）</p>
<p>（乙）制定貨物聯運運價遞遠遞减辦法。　　（丙）實行發售客運聯票及車輛過軌。　　（丁）舉行全國鐵路時刻綱會議，决定各站行車時刻相互銜接辦法，業已實行。</p>
<p>（戊）與招商局辦水陸聯運，使客貨先走陸路，後走水路，或先走水路，後走陸路，均可减省許多手續與時間。</p>
<p>（已）施行貨物到付聯運辦法，使貨商於貨物到逹目的地後，再行結算付費。</p>
<p>（庚）施行貨物押匯辦法，使貨商金融可資週轉。</p>
<p>（辛）頒布貨物裝卸辦法，使貨物得到裝卸上充分之便利與經濟。</p>
<p>上面種種設施，無非希望做到［整個運輸］四字。其旨趣是鐵路對於客貨，不但要從上站負責運到彼站，並且客貨的來蹝和去跡，也一槪顧到。換一句話，就是要設法把客貨從起點地起，一直平穏地迅速地運到目的地爲止。現在各路有在各大站辦理接送貨物，接送旅客的，也都是本此旨趣而行。將來推廣普遍，就可完成［整個運輸］的使命。</p>
<p>（三）有效運輸的意義與設施，所謂有效運輸，是指貨運而言。鐵路對於貨運，實在不能以貨物由此地運到彼地，便算盡其職責。鐵路有服務，應該要使貨物一運轉間，增高其效用或價值，纔算盡責，才是有效的運輸，照經濟學上講，各種貨品大槪有四種變化的效用：一種是地方效用，（Ｐｌａｃｅｕｌｉｌｉｔｙ）就是一件東西在過剩的地方，價值便低；把牠運到缺乏的地方，價值就立刻增高了。一種是時間效用，（</p>
<p>Ｔｉｍｅｕｔｉｌｉｔｙ）就是一件東西在市上過剩的時候，價值便低；過了幾時，市上缺乏了，牠的價值也就增高了。一種是形式的效用，（Ｆｏｒｍｕ</p>
<p>ｉｌｉｔｙ就是一種生貨，如棉花，價值並不甚高布，價值就不同了。（當然跟市塲變化）還有一種是主有效用：（Ｐｏｓｅｓｓｉｏｎｕｔｉｌｉｔｙ）譬如一件東西，在生產者乎裏，價值並不甚高；移到銷售者手裏，價值便不同了。各種果品，往往如此。鐵路處於運輸者地位，對於這四種效用。都有深切的關係。可以說，運輸辦得好，貨物的四種效用都可表顯出來；反之，也許把四種效用全給埋没了。鐵路運輸的有效無效，就看牠能不能帮助貨物顯出這四種效用。兪司長見到這一點，所以</p>
<p>（甲）辦理長途貨物負責聯運就是希望貨物儘量的表顯地方效用。</p>
<p>（乙）計劃創辦冷藏運輸及永久保管倉庫就是希望貨物昜壞者，可以不壞；速售者，可以待價而售，使貨物充分表顯其時間效用。</p>
<p>至於形式效用和主有效用，鐵路只能盡一部分運輸者的責任，因爲不能知道誰需要生貨，誰需要半製品，也不能知道誰要脫售，誰要接受。這裏頭的調劑工作，惟有各行商及銀行界擔在肩上，積極去辦，鐵路當然也願意與生產者及銷售者盡力合作，以完成調節一切貨品供求的使命。</p>
<p>一年來鐵道部在上海南京及北平，先後舉行三次全國鐵路没綫出產貨品展覽會，使民衆明瞭某處生產某種貨品，某處缺乏某種貨品，各種國產價格怎樣，運銷狀况怎樣，就是提倡產運銷三方面合作的先聲。近來鐵道部更通令各路在各站附設國貨販賣所，也是同樣的用意，均值得特别一提的。</p>
<p>京滬滬杭甬鐵路最近一年半來的設施，無不都是秉着兪司長所抱的［負責運輸］［整個運</p>
<p>輸］和［有效運輸］三個目標辦理。事實具在，不必贅說。今天趁此機會，把兪司長的意思宣述出來，使諸位代表澈底明瞭鐵路爲全民服務的意義，以及兩路正在根據這項意義，努力進和。惟一的希望，就在於各行商各本自已生產者銷售者或帮助生產者銷售者的地位，來和處於運輸者地位的鐵路，誠意合作，充分合作，把產，運，銷，三方打成一片，把兪司長所提倡的［負責運輸］，［整個運輸］，及［有效運輸］作到最澈底最圓滿的地步，以助國富的增加，民生的發展。</p>
<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>關於［文學槪論］—答周筠君—</h3>
<p>讀書指導：</p>
<p>從第一次通訊得到你們懇切的指示，我漸漸的學習理論了，雖則時間是那麽受限制，書本又那樣苦澀：可是經我不間斷精細閲讀後，倒也習慣成自然了。現在我感到一些槪論給我的空虚，一些槪論給我的糢糊，更有一些理論使我感到害怕。譬如潘梓年先生著的文學槪論罷，他先跟我說［文學是用文字做形式來表示生命之流的純粹情感。］又說：［······使人得着一種常常平衡的跳躍。］［單單表現的好也是不失爲文學作品。］［文學就是一個人把他所覺到的環境的不平，表現出來，這表現又能感動人家的．］而又說：［眞正的文學作品必能映出某時代的特色．］［文學家的所以偉大，就在於他的意識地或無意識地攝收了時代的思潮。］［一篇作品除報告一些事實外，没有顯出自已人格的風趣，就算不得文學作品。］［戲劇，小說，他們也要充滿詩意才算文學。］［文學是歷史的靈魂。］［文學是時代的先驅。］［文學的三個條件……］［情感之有價值者……［］宇宙觀，社會觀，］；表現方面又說：［古典主義［］浪漫主義］［自然主義］［新浪漫主義］［寫實派］［象徴派］［……］［……］。再如一些使我害怕的罷，他開了許多［哲學］［自然科學］［社會科學］等等的書，呌我逐一看完。的確，博學才能觀念正確，有了正確的觀念，才會產生有價值的正確的作品。不過這在於有錢的人當然不成問題，像我們時間和金錢都有限的人，可怎麽辦呢？恐怕要一世也看不完的！就是一世看完了，也不過做一世的學究和書呆啊！世界聞名的革命文豪高爾基可有這樣的過程呢？簡括一句，寫這封信我是有着這樣的幾個企圖：我不是要做學究和書呆，只消備一些文學正確的基本智識，從事創作不致落伍，而那本正確有系統的書在那裹？像我現在的程度，在你們的目光看來，距基本水凖尙有多遠？文學不是一般［隨便玩玩］的那麽容昜，是否如學者望人說的那麽艱難？……</p>

<h3>潘敎局長講　晚近敎育之新趨向</h3>
<p>▲昨在中西大藥房播音</p>
<p>本市教育局長潘公展氏、昨日下午四時半至五時半、在中西大藥房電台播音、題爲晚近敎育之新趨向、由聶海帆記錄、茲錄其演詞於下、在這外患頻仍、民族危急存亡最後掙扎關頭的中國、每個教育者、都負有千鈞的重担、而尤其是复敎育行政責任的人、我們雖部是敎育萬能論者、但决不能否認敎育是民族自救運動中之主力的一種、本來教育是輔助人類經營社會生活｜物質及精神的生活｜的方段、牠复着改良社會與促進人類生活趨向合理化的重大使命、所以一切的教育學說、教育政策教育方案、及其設施都須據着這個準則而被規定、凡是具有此項功能的敎育、即爲人民所需要的、合乎時代的、反之那就成爲社會上的赘疣了、至多亦不過是社會的裝飾品而已、（見生產教育與政治教育）唯其如此、所以我們對於目前敎育的任務與趨勢、不能不應有明確的認識和了解、最近敎育的新趨勢、以環境事實潮流而論、均趨向於科學化、生產化、然推究其原因、實受十八世紀盧梭Rousicou敎育思想的影響、同時又經過十九世紀裴斯太洛齊Pestalozzi海爾巴脫Herbrt弗祿培爾Foredel以及斯賓塞Spencer四人的贊同、最近又加以杜威Dewey桑戴克Thondike克柏屈烈克Cilpairsk等人的極力提倡、就造了今日敎育科學化、以及敎育生產化的趨勢、茲略述於下㈠敎育科學化的新趨勢、自工業革命以後、科學的昌明與進步、眞可說一日千里、其最大的效力即就是由個人的利益而趨勢重於羣衆的利益、由分子的利益而趨重於社會的利益、而在敎育上、則就處處引用科學適用科學打破以前那種種承襲的呆板的主張、而一變爲富有實際的科學的意義、盧梭裴斯太洛齊海爾巴脫弗祿培爾斯賓塞以及杜威等的理論、方法都是採取科學的方法、故甚爲進步、且爲一般人所歡迎、而在科學中與敎育最有密切關係者、要算生物學、心理學、論理學社會學、等等、現在無論學校的組織課程、敎法去研究去實施、現在麥柯爾Maeall的敎育實騐法以及彭塞爾Bonser巴必脫Babbilt等的編製課程以及克柏屈烈克的、創行設計敎育法等等、都是敎育科學化的顯明表示、㈡敎育生產化的新趨勢、人生於世爲的是求生存、欲求生存須應求生存之滋養品、滋養品之是否獲得、必須視其工具如何而後定、換言之、人必求食、求食必幹事、而使人得到幹事的一切工具、乃敎育也、所以現今的敎育專家、均主張學校內至少應注意下列三點、第一、注重業務精神和興趣的訓練、第二、增加業務的知識和技能、第三、推廣業務的機會和設備、以上這幾件事、杜威魯士金Ruskin何英Horne以及白蘭德等等都是如此主張、同時又主敎學應以「做」爲中心、換言之、就是學農的應到農村去、學工的應到工廠去、學礦的開礦去、不要使學校的敎育、變爲無用的貴族式的敎育、專側重文字、輕視勞工、而忽略實用、這是應痛改的事、總而言之、教育的進展是隨環境的變遷而改造的、上面所說的敎育新趨勢、係就敎學本身而言、但在敎育政策方面、謂民主式自由式的敎育學說、已成過去陳績了、現在各國的敎育政策、都走上同志的一條路、蘇俄以統制敎育、希、達共產口號的普遍、意大利德意志、均以敎育統制、爲實行法西政治的基礎、其他如英美法等國、都認敎育應由國家統一辦理的必要、此種認識、實在因爲自由放任式、虛僞民主式的時代、造成國家的紛亂龐雜、無力無能、而造成名族思想根本的敎育、應該負重大的責任、晚近因政治經濟的趨向統一、而使敎育政策、有統制的趨勢、這是很合理的、</p>

<h3>誠實第一—獻給國貨生產者與銷售者—</h3>
<p>— 競存</p>
<p>說來眞生痛心，國貨界竟然發生了掛羊頭賣狗肉的勾當。同樣的貨品，價錢要此外貨貴，質料反比外貨劣，無論是國貨生產者或是銷售者，如果眞有這樣的事實，這不僅是國貨界的不幸，並且可以說是民族的不幸。無論是用甚麼理由說，在中國的市塲上，拿國貨和外貨相比較，不論就生產的成本說，或是就運輸的運費說，國貨的價値，應該要此外貨便宜些，至少也不應此外貨貴。卽或因精選原料加工製造的商品，成本要比外貨貴，但是在品質方面，一定要比外貨優，纔說得過去。如果品質旣不及外貨優，價値却反此外貨貴，這種國貨運動的反宜傳，其力量實太於一切，年來國貨運動之難有進展，這也許是重大原因之一。</p>
<p>作者自信是同情於國貨運動者，有時因爲購買國貨上了當，反受了家人的譏刺，便宜是甚麼人都愛好的，明知其不便宜而甘願吃虧，這種寃大頭，是誰都不願意做的，我們雖然爲國家的經濟着想，爲國民的經濟着想，不能不購用國貨，然而眼見爲提倡國貨而上了不誠實的國貨生產者或銷售者的大當，也許就對國貨運動要反愛爲憎，至少也將减低提倡國貨的熱情，這種掛羊頭賣狗肉的勾當，不是國貨界的自殺政策嗎？</p>
<p>我願以十二分的熱情，以「誠實」兩字忠告於我國國貨界，在這國民經濟行將破產的時候，幸有這國貨運動的倡導，國貨運動如果有了成效，首先得着利益的，就是國貨生產者與銷售者，在這國貨運動的時期中，國貨生產者不應只顧目前的小利，偷工减料，以劣品供給市塲：國貨銷售者更不應利用提倡國貨的美名，貪圖較大的利潤，以次貨朦混顧顧客。喪失了寶貴的信用，在國貨運動中，國貨生產者與銷售者，應該認清事實甚於宣傳，國貨運動如果要有成效，當以「誠實「爲第一義。</p>
<p>國貨討論</p>
<h3>新稅則與我國國貨業的危機</h3>
<p>— 盧狹</p>
<p>自從民國十九年我國恢復了關稅自主權。以及去年五月中國互惠關稅恊定期滿以來，外貨輸入受了限制，國貨業有長足的進步。據華商紗廠聯合會年會報告書上所說：單就本包粗細布一項而言，二十年進口爲九百餘萬元，去年却减至一百萬元上下。至於其他物品，也就不言而喻。正希望政府再接再再厲也奠立保護關稅的基礎，使國內幼穉的工商業，獲得正常的發展。</p>
<p>前天報上戴有財政部解釋新稅則的消息，可是連他也不能自圓其說。事實最爲雄辯，讓我們仔細就本月三號本報所登戴載的新稅則全文加以檢討吧。最使我們注意的，便是棉及其製品、這裏面，關於漂白和染色的棉剪絨回絨，印花素粗細布，軟稀洋紗等，每公尺减稅三厘到一角一不等。棉花却增稅了，是每百公斤加一元半。機械方面，都是增稅的：農業機器及配件增三，五％，發電機增七，五％，製造機械工具煤氣汽油引擎以及縫紉機……未列名機器及配件增二·五％。還有打字機編號機鐘表電</p>
<p>話機電報機無線電機……電氣用具等，都是增稅百分之五。化學品醋酸硼酸硫酸等加一角至一元不等。漂白粉每百公斤加五％，甘油加二元一，染料顏料……等加五元，煤油箱裝加三角，散艙加一角。……我們用不着多舉了，讓讀者把新稅則與舊稅則對照看來便知其詳。　　這些年頭，外患內憂未已，人民購買力低落，國貨業之所以查强人意，在驚風駭浪中獲得進展的緣故，不得不歸因於人民愛國心和關稅自主。不過人民總是貪便宜貨的，除了很少數愛國志士之外，不會永遠服用國貨，這樣我們不得不謀國貨業本身的發展，逹到價廉物美的目的。可是要發展國內實業，第一要保護國內市塲，排斥他國貨品。第二要有大量的資本以供利用。然而事實上怎樣呢？美國已在實施白銀政策，那是向我們傾銷的第一個步驟（不久以前愚曾在本欄寫過一篇『羅斯福白銀政策與各國國貨業之前途』，請參閱）。在這樣政策下，外國貨物充塞市塲，而白銀流出得很快，我國國貨業旣然失掉了可利用的大幫資金，又失掉了國內市塲，當然沒有發展的希望了。我們現在只有這唯一的最後的武器：關稅政策。關稅政策有利於國內產業是很明顯的，像那行　Ｈｕｌｌ　Ｔａｒｉｆｆ：何况工商業落後的我國？</p>
<h3>國貨考察圑到內地去的任務怎樣？</h3>
<p>— 全甲</p>
<p>在最近的報章所載，我們知道熱心國貨諸公，除了在都市裏宣傳，對於內地的國貨事業，確已注意及了。像西北流動國貨展覽會等，牠的意義和使命誠是最大的。但是，賢明的諸公們！除了對於你出品可以牟利的一點外，這含有更大的使命，或許你所忽略吧！</p>
<p>一，內地農村的破產，人民經濟力又這樣的薄弱，國貨考察圑所出售的物品，應實用爲主！一方面格外把售價减低，使購買率增大。同時你應該調查牠們的手工業是怎樣的陷於危險的地位，可以帮助的尤應該替帮助他們，使得對於民族的手工業得到一點點曙光。</p>
<p>二，如果你預備投資的，那麼你尤應該擇比較有利於大衆的，而且擇國貨裏所需要的，不然，爲着利益而在同一個事業上作無謂的競爭，恐怕是聰明的諸公所不屑爲吧！</p>
<p>三，你尤應該和內地的金融機關或社會圑體聯絡，上者可以借他作國貨事業的援助，後者可以藉此而作國貨事業的宣傳，我想不論你怎樣起勁，構通這二個有實力可以幫助你的機關，也是必需的呀！</p>
<p>四，在內地，帝國主義的侵入是很利害的，你該確確實實地調查，列强是怎樣的吸去農村的經濟，使得你，或者後來的努力國貨者有一個借鏡，去杜塞這個危險的洞。</p>
<p>五，除了你去宣傳外，你還可以把內地產物或可以利用改良成一個有利國貨的廠，報告給政府那是最好了，至少，對於國家財政，多一筆收人。</p>
<p>賢明的諸公呀！我是怎樣熱誠的期待着你們的凱旋啊！你們肯實踐，肻實地去介紹和推銷，這種精神，確是最可値得預祝的，在這裏，我就提出來，其他的五點任務，作爲拋磚引玉之舉呀！</p>
<h3>一週間國貨界新訊</h3>

<h3>國貨西北流動展覽會參觀記</h3>
<p>— 覺岸</p>
<p>「西北」這一個名詞，在現在好像時髦得很，同時也好像偉大得很。的確，「西北」在從前是我國文化的發源地，在現在是我們的生命綫；生長在這種强隣迫境，掙扎圖存的中國人，對於「西北」！足以開發，正在開發的「西北」是值得注意的。</p>
<p>這一次上海中華國貨產銷合作恊會大發宏願，連合了上海二十幾家國貨廠商，組織一個國貨西北流動展覽圑，不遠千里的到開封，鄭州，洛陽以及西安等處來展覽，這，無論在提倡國貨或是開發西北上說，都是一件值得讚揚的事。</p>
<p>開封兩個星期，鄭州兩個星期，接下去是洛陽了！自從報紙上發表了西北國貨展覽圑的消息之後，洛陽的人民就在盼望着光臨了，要是形容得眞切一點，那眞是如大旱之望雲霓；實在，沈悶的古都，是需要這樣的一個勝會來熱鬧熱鬧，鼓舞鼓舞。</p>
<p>好了，希望已久的「西北國貨展覽圑」終於在行都的商場揭幕了！雖然因爲行色忽忽，沒有怎樣盛大的佈置，可是，規模是已經不小了，大門口紮了一座彩牌，美麗的「國貨西北流動展覽團」的旗幟，在天空中隨風飄揚着，底下如潮似的參觀者，肩摩跟接的朝裏走，心裏好像都存着一種先覩爲快的希冀，記者當然也是當中的一份子。據說，當早晨人最擁的時候，因爲天氣太熱，一個四十多幾的老者，曾因熱而斃命，這可想見當時的一種盛况和西北人民對於提倡國貨的熱忱了。</p>
<p>廿幾家國貨工廠，依次的分左右排列着。靠左的以中國化學工業社，中華琺瑯廠，家庭工業社，泰康食品公司，以及三友事業社，佈置最爲整齊精巧，他們的生意也比較格外的來得生色。靠右的以幾家綢緞廠，橡膠廠比較醒目，就中以光華汽燈廠的台燈，亮亮的一盞，孤傲的立着，最爲動人。一般鄕下的父老，他們看東看西，覺得件件都好，可是錢不幫忙，無已，只好儘選那比較價錢少一點，買一件兩件，聊以止止滿懷的慾望，所以，非上洋錢莫辦的綢緞毛絨，門庭就冷落得多了，這，也許是農村破產的表現吧！　　話說得多了，總之，我這一次參觀了國貨西北展覽團以後，覺得心上非常高興，第一，我們中國並不是沒有好好的國貨，這一次的展覽可以予西北的人民一個充分的認識。第二，中國的人民並不是不愛國貨，特別是西北的人民，這一次可以充分表現出愛用國貨的熱忱。這一次西北國貨展覽團的舉辦，我覺得非常值得敬佩，可惜偌大的一個中國，僅有廿幾家國貨塲商參加，未免覺得有點美中不足，所以，我希望着，竭誠的希望着，以後像這樣的盛會，多舉辦幾個，參加的廠商，也多增加幾個，使得整個的中國，完全都走到使用國貨的一條路上來！（七月一日於洛陽周公廟）</p>

<h3>國貨陳設競賽橱窗之第五幕</h3>
<p>— 其難</p>
<p>走過華美烟公司前，撲面的一座橱窗，又換過花樣了，代替景綸衫　廠的陳設，中法藥房的人丹，正在那裏勾留行人作暫時的駐足。</p>
<p>橱窗陳設原是商業美術的一部分，其整個的目的在於把陳設上所特具的刺激力，使看見他的人們得到深刻的印象。因爲國貨陳設競賽橱窗，僅容每一參加的廠家作十日的陳設，所以參加者無不努力提高期陳設的刺激力而思收其廣告的效果。</p>
<p>這一次中法藥房的陳設，是立體派的陳設；金色石膏泥製成的「人丹」兩個大字，便是立體形的。「人」字的地位比「丹」字來得高，可說是最簡單的階段形的排列。字腹中空，嵌入電泡，入夜發光作深紅色。字後於紅邊黑地的襯板，愈顯出，人丹兩字的珍貴。藥本身的身價，全在這上面表示出來，這便是他們陳設上刺激力的最高點。所可惜的是襯板之後還少了一重銀灰色的背景，微嫌其光彩太幽暗了些。</p>
<p>橱地敷白緞，上置包裝盒裝的人丹，尙稱醒目。</p>
<p>綜觀全橱窗的陳設，因爲主體的集中，所以刺激力也很大。他的旁邊的一座買司干橱窗裝飾，却是利用壁畫式的廣告來襯托陳設主體的。他們兩家鬥角鈎心，各極其妙，關心商業美術的，何妨去觀望一番呢。</p>
<h3>短訊</h3>
<p>上海橡膠工業，多以雨鞋爲大宗，出品近來受外貨傾銷之影響，停業者時有所聞，茲有橡膠業前輩蔡春芳君，謀救濟之法，發起創設乾豐實業製造廠於閘北恒業路，以橡膠原料製造各種實用品，該廠規模頗大，資本雄厚，機器均選最新式者。蔡君係前江灣模範工廠副總辦，現充上海市橡膠同業公會顧問，對於橡膠工業，經騐豐富，刻該廠機器已經佈置完妥，不日即將開工。聞該廠新發明一種橡皮糖，爲最特色，係以橡皮原料和於口香糖中，爲中國之首創者，想將來當爲橡膠業新闢一出路云。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>說話和沈默</h3>
<p>— 觀</p>
<p>老子是好像最不喜歡說話的了，然東挪西扯，也著作五千言。成書若干卷，専論沈默之好處，舉世亦當笑其誣。所以簡單說了幾句，而近於眞理。　知者不言，妙道皆藏在肚里，使人莫測高深，也可以使人疑心其實無有；但懂到玄虛的無過於老子了，猶有五千言，那麼拿這標凖推測凡人，其不言之故，或則比老子還玄虛，深奧，或則竟毫無所知，猶之一個外國人不懂中國話，當然也無從說起。</p>
<p>閱世深，見聞廣，所持者浩大，必當到一種境地，竟覺無話可說。無話可說有二義：一是有話不能說，好像到了土耳其；二是有話不想說，是純粹心理作用。此涵多義，這里也不想說。前者客觀，後者主觀。</p>
<p>談理談到極致，不能說非假，不能說非眞，</p>
<p>馴至語言道斷，心思路絕，這又別開一境，佛說謂之不可思議，也歸於沈默一途。</p>
<p>反過來看一看今之說話者，或一登講壇，滔滔不絕，口若懸河；或奮然執筆，立刻寫滿若干方格。細細考查，所說的是什麼呢？大體可用四個子包括：不知所云。</p>
<p>不知所云亦有二義：對於所說者弄不清楚，并自己亦莫明奇妙，說一通完事，是一種。或急不擇言，傾吐無緒，在文學上的一種境，表示無限悲凉或無限欣悅，也是一種。　現代人多是旣不能知，復不能言。言則不知所云，攏統成一大悶局，好像永遠隔了智慧和眞理。</p>
<h3>熱在南京（二）</h3>
<p>— 曙山</p>
<p>豈眞佛法無靈嗎？也或許天不厭過，活該人們要遭此浩劫，也未可知吧，我想。</p>
<p>熱啦，熱啦，到處都聽到這種呼聲。</p>
<p>老媽子在熱氣蒸騰的廚房裏呌熱，而我端起盌來也呌熱；黃包車夫在烈日如火之下奔跑着呌熱，而我坐在車上也呌熱；有時我到人家的高樓大厦中，披開衣襟，對着電扇，張開嘴巴，吃着西瓜或冰淇淋等等，大家也還是以熱啦熱啦的話相酬答。呵，無窮無富，無間無忙，一片的呼聲只是熱，又何怪那懶得連矢都不想去吃的黃狗的舌頭常伸出在嘴外呢？　在七十多萬的南京市民中，迄今究有若干由於中署而病而死的，我們雖未看到統計，但以近半月來的死亡率激增，據說實高出了平常的數字，這殆是事實。又聽說有一個黃包車夫把人拖到鼓樓時，車剛放下來，而錢還未拿到手，就一下跌倒而布起來了。說到這點，眞也令人覺得矛盾而爲難：你說他們可憐而不坐他們的車子吧，則他們將吃什麼？爲着他們的生活關係而照常坐他們的車子吧，則於心又怎過得去？我不知道那些慈善家，都到那裏去避暑，而不對此問題早作些打算。我想，他們如在這炎夏中，至少也應該多給錢而不呌快跑吧！至於車夫爲什麼要拚命的拖着車子跑？則無非是爲着金錢，爲着生活，但不幸的，反因此而死。這又是以喚醒在別一種」人爲財死」的意義下混着的人們之迷夢了。</p>
<p>在這個當兒，無論農村是何等破產，市面是何等蕭條，無非西瓜和冰的生意，莫不是利市三倍的。</p>
<p>游泳一道，正當各處盛行提倡之際，而京市亦自不能爲例外。據說京市署期游泳比賽會，已進行籌備，並决定俟美人魚楊秀瓊到南昌後，即請其于歸途來南京表演。由此則日來分赴中山門外中央游泳池，新街口業餘體育會游泳池，及已廢通濟門外九龍橋游泳池之靑年男女，爲着消夏而去練習游泳者，自然是很多很多。只怪那九龍橋游泳池，自民國二十年開放以來，平均每夏溺斃之游人，約計在十人左右，而今年雖早早的拆去設備，禁止入游，但一般有游泳狂的人還不顧一切，趨之若騖，以致迄今慘遭滅頂者，已有了三人；莫非那裏眞的有鬼麼？至如郭大斧等之力追史家兄弟，橫泅長江，那儘可說是特例。又秦淮歌女王熙春和谷愛珍兩人，她們也竟想自居高貴，持着僞證跑到業餘去游泳，卒致被人發覺，疑有弊端，並爲羣衆衛生起見。大起交涉，終於她們則溜之大吉，而檢驗員遂遭一番大大的沒趣。</p>
<p>凡有公私汽車可坐的人們，畢竟覺得電扇，西瓜和冰淇淋等，還不足以消解其悶熱，必得再坐汽車出去兜兜風才好。爲着兜風，就得開足了馬力，因而像我們這些慣以兩條腿去逛馬路的人，便不得不格外的當心，和必須要加倍的吃飽了灰塵。</p>
<p>有些有錢而又有閒的人們，都已遠走高飛的到各處去避暑了。各級學校中的男女學生們，也太多已放假回家去，跳出這像蒸籠般的都市而到農村間去納凉了。至其中有有家歸不得的少數人，仍住在學校裏，也自然與我們這些無閒而又無錢出碼頭去避暑的人是一樣的，每於夕陽西下時隨便走到各風凉處吃茶和散散步而已　說道吃茶散步的地方，在這偌大的南京城內外，縱勉强的數起來，也不過有如下的幾處：第一公園，鼓樓公園，秦淮河及秦淮小公園，玄武湖及五洲公園，莫愁湖，白露洲，北極閣，清凉山，五台山，雨花台，靈谷寺及總理陵園一帶，以及江蘇省立民衆敎育館而已。</p>
<p>再分別的說來，如靈谷寺和雨花台等處，雖都是有山有水，風景絕佳，濃蔭匝地，凉爽宜人，但因爲都在城外，路途較遠，若無汽車可以代步的人們，住返實非易易。鼓樓公園，地點雖很適於城內人游玩，但因其面積甚小，又無茶可吃，亦只宜於黃昏後去小坐片刻耳。他如白露洲，北極閣，清凉山，五台山等處，大都是偏僻荒穖，草深徑曲，其間縱沒有豺狼當道，甚至於如明孝陵後之白晝食人，而蛇虺遍地，動輒肆毒，亦足以令人有些戒心。例如前幾天有某夜行於三牌樓附近，竟被丈餘大蛇咬傷而喪命；又中大鄧，王二生夜往北極閣乘凉，當被一條青蛇追得幾乎要嚇死。還有金大護士徐慧娟女士，夜行僻經，被人謀斃，至今還是一件無頭案。由此種種，則於此等地方一到日落後，只看游人紛紛的都不約而去了。至於秦淮河畔的民衆敎育館，願爲韜園舊址，內有花草可賞，亦有茶點可吃，只因爲是民眾教育館，而不是大衆游樂地，於是爲納凉而去者也就不多見。又其對岸之鑑園，覽園，在幾年前還都有綠竹猗猗，內設茶社，而今以已不知都到那裏去了。在私家花園中，還有愚園即胡家花園，素最有名，記得我於民國十七年，最喜歡與蠻等那裏去乘凉或賞月，但後來則圯毀日甚，不堪揷足，因而我們至今也沒有過去。</p>
<h3>露露</h3>
<p>— 蒲風</p>
<p>帶幾分嬌羞流着淚，露露，我曉得當初你不願意學習舞蹈。可是，貧窮决定了你的運命，你，你爹媽又那能讓你嬌養在家裏？穿起那紅紅綠綠的綾羅綢紗，我明白微笑中你藏下了難數的酸悲；晚上出去，黎明又拖回沉重的身體，凌亂的步聲中我熟悉你心頭的淚。唉！要是兵禍不使你媽讓田園荒蕪，露露，荷鋤負粑也許正是你的長處。但是，大兵曅竟把你們趕到了都市，都市，失業的爸，那不把你當作搖錢樹？哦！可憐的露露！就讓紅藍的燈光從今慢慢蝕盡你整個靑春嗎？一天，你會在悠揚的jazz樂中倒下，等着吧，遲早你會僅剩下貧血病體哩！</p>
<h3>舊文人的文學遊戲</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>上海文學社發了近二百封徴求海內作家述說自我與文學間的連繫的信，在「我與文學」上刋出的共五十九人。這五十三人，說由唐宋古文或莊子文選之類的啟發而走上文學之途的，並無一人，大都由三國演義，聊齋誌異，西遊記，引導他們上文學之路；尤可異者，並沒有一個作家，從大學文科出身。這些作家，至少他們的寫作，可以列在水平綫以上，而與「子曰詩云」老店簡直沒有什麼往來，豈不是明明宣告「子曰詩云」的總破產。或人提出抗議，要請這五十九個作家去當文學侍從之臣；或是某要人五十大慶了，要一副壽聯，一篇壽文；或是某大人壽終正寢了，要一篇祭文，一篇墓誌銘；或是某將軍準備下野了，要一篇宣言，一篇通電，於是五十九個作家一齊擱筆，搔首問天，非捧手讓捧水烟袋的老秘書來搖頭吟哦不可。　顯然地在我們面前擺著兩條大路：一條是走向文藝創作的路,老老實實用語言文字來表達自己的情感意志，要親切才有味。一條是走向文學侍從的路，要代上頭立言，不許着半點自己的主觀，以隱晦爲技巧。前者發展天才，後者發展奴才；前者以文字語言表現自我，後者以觀念以文字爲游戲；前者把屈原離騷，當作古今第一大作家第一大作品，後者則以爲「失之褊激不足爲訓」。（見資治通鑑）彼此的觀點不同，彼此的基本訓練不同，所以一方面看看後輩的青年，不足以繼承奴才的大業，慨然以爲非復與文言布可；一方面則以爲古老櫻桃樹應該斫掉，老人哭不如青年笑之爲得。（柴霍甫櫻桃園）這條鴻溝，永遠填不滿的。</p>
<p>現在我們來看看舊文人如何練習文字游戲，如何運用文字游戲。舊文人旣處在奴才地位，替他的主子秉筆立言，或者主子有難言之隱，或許主子要指鹿以爲罵，修辭立誠這個原則，當然用不着了，只好走另外一條路，隱隱約約，似走而非，穿了神秘外衣扮演出來；如變戲法似的，明明是假的，要眼快手快，扮演的十分逼真。玩戲法的徒弟，最初學些三變金錢，空中取米那些小戲法；舊文人也先學些猜謎，對語，破題那些文字小遊戲，然後推廣開去。前人入私墊讀書，執筆爲文，就要學做破題；破題和做燈謎最相近，四書本文有如謎底，依着謎底做一個謎出來。好的謎文，恰巧藏住那個謎底。破題旣成，就依着破題敷衍開去，所謂「破題术做，文章由我；旣做破題，我由文章。」相傳有一童生，年七十餘求考，文宗以「長而無述焉，老而不死」爲題，命作破題。童生即應曰：「不得其名，必得其壽。」文宗奇之，遂入學，從技巧上說，這破題是做得好的；不相干的題目，居然言之成理，而且恰合他自己的身份。推而用之，舊文人的一切看家本領，詩鐘，對聯，壽文，墓誌銘，通電，宣言，便用這個方式扮演出來。當北宋末年，徽欽北「狩」，（狩字便是文人弄把戲。）宋高宗逃到杭州去「苟安」，原不是什麼體面的事。而汪藻爲隆祐太后作手筆云：</p>
<p>「繇康邸之舊藩，嗣我朝</p>
<p>之大統；漢家之厄十世，</p>
<p>宜光武之中興；獻公之子</p>
<p>九人，惟重耳之尚在；茲</p>
<p>惟天意，夫豈人謀。」</p>
<p>說得多麼光彩體面。太上皇在冰天雪地裏過囚犯的日子，多麼丟大宋的面子；而汪藻爲高宗作遙賀太上皇萬壽表，乃云：</p>
<p>「帝堯游汾水之陽，久忘</p>

<p>「愛國不敢後人，成功豈</p>
<p>必自我？」</p>
<p>輕輕兩句話，把那「留得一兵一甲還要拼命守土」的前言一筆勾銷，堂而皇之地溜向東洋而無愧色。這種從無可說處找話說，以詞語來掩飾事實的隱晦手叚，成就了舊文人的文字游戲的最高成績。　其在日常應酬文字，或是田園千傾的老太爺，或是兒孫滿堂的老太婆；左不過是好福氣的題材；或用之於慶賀，或用之於弔祭，扳定的有褒無貶，有譽無毀。旣是奉命秉筆，非做不可，又要當心馬腳，拍得其所。如袁世凱五十大壽，有人祝之以聯，云：</p>
<p>五嶽同尊，惟嵩其峻極；　　百年上壽，如日之方中。　吳佩孚以兩湖巡閱使駐節洛楊，煊赫一時，康有爲於其五十壽辰，祝之以聯云：</p>
<p>牧野鷹揚，百歲英名纔半　　世；　　洛陽虎視，八方風雨會中　　州。　道兩副對聯，恰巧拍上了兩個英雄的誇大心理，當然是上乘工夫了。其他墓誌銘壽文之類，說來說去，無非要搬弄字眼兒，如凑七巧板似的，雖只是那塊小板兒，花樣却要層出不窮。舊文人之所以自高者在此，而我們所以斥爲玩物喪志非根本剷除這文字游戲的觀念不可者亦在此。　在某次朋友集談中，大家說：「我們要反對以文字以觀念爲游戲的態度。」那並不是一句空洞的口號，那是針對着舊文人的病根而言的！</p>
<h3>我來自東　（二）</h3>
<p>— 星野</p>
<p>在這綠柔紅軟的櫻花時，我向華盛頓說了再會！華盛頓也像美國其他的城市一樣，沒什麼麼多大可留戀的地方，不過這裏稍有些兒例外。最使我依依不捨的，是那智慧實藏的國會圖書館：在那邊我曾經消磨了四個月的時光；在那裏我開始體會到深長的讀書興趣；在那裏我發見了一個所謂文化人最理想的樂園；在那裏我認識到文明累積的豐富和偉大。我悔恨這樣的匆匆，便離開這個合於理想的所在。我很憂懼在我祖國裏，我再不能找到這樣優美的求學環境。而我深知道這種憂懼，便是事實。當我最後一次跑出了那刻滿希臘女像的銅門，我似乎已經從智慧的宮殿被擯出來，而一步步的向着愚昧的方向進行。</p>
<p>白宮和國會雖然曾給我不少的興趣，然而那究竟不如我們中國使館的使我難忘。在我離開華盛頓的時候，施公使已經到歐洲去了。十九街的中國使館附近，正天是那樣的寂寂。街上沒精打采走着一二個廣東人洗衣作的孩子。小小的人兒，負着一大包待洗的衣服；從使館的邊門走將出來。使館的門役，是美國少年。他還是那樣彬彬有禮，好像也曾受過儒家的洗禮。半舊半新的會客廳的牆壁上，掛着蔣總司令穿灰色軍衣的照相。幾塊嵌中國繡的玻璃晝，和桌上的古玩相配，在古氣中透出來不振作的樣子。房子的一角放着一架舊鋼琴，大概幾年沒有彈奏了：</p>
<p>我默然和使館中人告了再會，他們向我很和藹的點頭中含着很悠長的善意。我希望下次到這裏來的時候，中國使館在華盛頓外交地圖上已經脫穎而出。我想那時我們賢明的公使們，不但他們個人的道德學問爲他人欽服，而他們所代表的中國，也已經一樣的受人敬畏。我對使館默默的點頭，我似乎對我的祖國和對自己都有所期許。</p>

<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>這種情形，我們雖明知是太監們的搗鬼，可是誰敢給太后說呢？　因爲拿刀錢，討賞錢的習慣，在宮裏已成一種牢不可破的陋規；就是太后知道了，也只能付諸一笑而已。在這列火車上，有一個太監是專門給我收拾床舖，並照料洗臉漱口等事的，我少不得又須重賞他一番。</p>
<p>據我自己混統算起來，就拿我們在宮裏頭或頤和園裏過的日子算，每一天平均必須支出賞錢二十兩，合如今的銀幣三十元左右。再加動不動還有特殊的開銷，我父親眞給我們累得夠了！可是我和我的妹妹都是絕對不會打算盤的人，所以父親究竟化了多少錢，才把我們維持在宮內，若是之久，我們眞說不出確數來；祇知道那是决非一個小小的數目！其中的大部份是用來買東西貢呈太后的。貢呈太后的東西當然以尤精貴爲尤妙，其價値也就可以想見了。（八六）</p>
<h3>頤和園裏過日子</h3>
<h3>海外紀事之殊榮</h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>從來只有外國人到中國來買書去，　討書去，甚至偷書去。只有把中國人的著作去翻譯，或是翻印。從來沒有過外國的君主，替中國人的著作撰序文的，有之，其維海外紀事罷！</p>
<p>海外紀事是清大汕厂翁所作，厂翁又稱長壽（寺名）石頭陀，所爲詩文，楚楚有致。康熙甲戍，應安南國王阮福週之聘，（當時稱越國）到那邊去講經傳戒，極受優待，國王且執弟子禮，所以他給厂翁撰序，稱「大越國王阮福週受菩薩戒弟子，法名興童，頂禮撰於西宮覺王內院之淨名方丈。」那時安南國全給佛的空氣籠罩着，國王對於厂翁可說言聽計從，連政治也問他問訊的。厂翁似乎也有些小技巧的，或者就是現在所謂密宗，能够在海洋裏掛幡念咒，鎮定風波；能够在久雨的恐慌裏，求得大放晴光，這也是取信於人之道。他還向國王建議數事：一是修貢中國，以正名號。二是設奇戍以固邊陲。三是愛軍士以作忠勇。四是設學宮以育人才。見得他不單是在傳敎，見得他的學問，不單在佛敎。宗敎和政治，有相連關係，尤其是在六七百年前呢。就是現在，還有人想利用宗敎作政治手腕的，像日本的佛敎會，（？）竭力去引誘暹羅的居士和尚，便是明證。</p>
<p>厂翁生當易代，不免故國之思，所以吳江徐釻的序裏，說他「殆有託而逃於禪者也。」在案南國王的序裏，知道福週的父王，也會徵聘過的，厂翁沒有去。後應福週的招，乙亥春抵國，丙子夏返，留在那裏有一年多，不僅討讑佛學，所以說「其爲禆益政治實多。」還說厂翁著書二十餘種，不知道是怎樣的書，我查中國人名大辭典，也只著錄海外紀事一種，不知道廣東的志乘裏，有沒有較周詳的著錄？　安南雖然已非我有，但是厂翁當時的一番苦心孤詣，不應埋沒，我們必須喪而書之，使今之居士們和尚們看看，再自己去問問。</p>
<h3>車錢</h3>
<p>— 孔皆</p>
<p>！六十年來未有奇熱，寒署表熱的水銀儘上升||八十度，九十度，一百度，……。路上的柏油全給晒化了，踏上去是軟軟的：汽車的輪子很容易在上面留下條條花紋。　「啪，啪，啪，……」一輛黃色車從橫路轉過，光着的腳底打在地上，在這靜寂的街上，清脆的聲音使呆瞪着眼的警士抬起眼來，看了下。</p>
<p>車上客人的腳打着車沿，車在一所大洋房前停下，從那大玻璃窗裏，可以看見許多在談，笑，吃，喝，他們似乎並不熱，車夫抹着汗，身上，臉上。</p>
<p>一步跨下車，挺起胸，嘴裏吹着哨子，那外國水兵走向那扇轉着的門，車夫忙跟了上去，一手抹着汗，輕輕推推那個的腰：「……」嘴唇動了幾下，似乎想說什麼，但只伸出了一隻手，手心向天平放着，抖抖地。</p>
<p>「唔」回頭略一看但仍走了進去。</p>
<p>車夫還想等他出來，手扶着牆向門裏張望。但他的手似乎被什麼打了一下，酸，疼，抬起頭來，一個印度巡捕瞪眼看着，手裏一根木棍在擺動。</p>
<p>拉起車，直搖着手指，辣辣地。向玻璃窗裏看：高舉着一隻玻璃杯張着嘴，似乎在喊什麼，坐他車的那個水手正笑着。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第三十二回　聲色自娛將軍終日樂　老少環泣戰士幾人回</p>
<p>因爲天氣很暖和，桂枝呌車夫把棉布蓬子下了，脖子上繞了紅毛繩圍巾，將一床狗皮褥子在下半截身上一圍，連兩隻手都塞在裏面，也就相當的不冷了。那車子慢慢的拉着，和人走路差不多，約莫走了六七里，在路中間停下了一輛汽車，三四個人正在那裏向車子圍住議論着，似乎發愁想不出辦法。其中有個穿西服，外加皮大衣的漢子，似乎是這車子的主人翁，頓着脚在那裏駡人，他呌道：車子停在這裏，進不能進，退不能退，呌我怎麼辦？你們知道姨太太病了，我等着去看他，你們故意搗亂的吧？他口裏說着，手上取了頭上的皮帽子下來，搖擺了幾下，又向頭上蓋着。桂枝聽他在大路頭上，大聲疾呼的呌着姨太太，不免微微一笑。那人見他笑着，倒不肯坦然受之，也將眼睛合了縫，向他笑着。桂枝紅了臉，不敢再望着。好在車子雖拉的很慢，並不會停住，所以只片刻工夫，車子也就拉過身了。桂枝心裏這就想着，一個作婦女的，眞是隨便不得，若不是在車上，這一笑幾乎又要惹出是非來呢。女人出門，遇到這種事，也很平常，到了城裏，進了新居，帮着料理房屋，當然也不把這樣一件事放在心上。他們所住的地方，乃是糧食行的後面，一座小跨院。隔了兩重屋脊，乃是人家的大洋樓。那洋樓上人，開了窗戶，就把這院子裏的行動，看的清清楚楚。同時這院子裏人，向那樓上看去，也是清清楚楚的。桂枝到了一個新地方，不免四處都打量打量。在這天晚上，那樓上各窗戶，一律放出電燈光亮來。有的是隔着玻璃，有的是隔着白色的窗紗，有的隔着紅綠的窗簾，只在這一點上，已經可以表現那人家的華麗來。（四三七）</p>

<h3>亢旱中的蘇州</h3>
<p>— 朱𦐂</p>
<p>在這奇熱而兼亢旱的現在，蘇州也好久沒　　　有雨了。就是有時烏雲彌天，很像大雨在望，可是經過幾陣薰風，早已雲去天靑，赤日如火。熱度是一天天在升高，水是一天天的缺乏，在這亢旱的嚴重局勢之下，蘇州社會上，早發生重大的不安；人人心頭，都重重的壓着恐怖旱荒的石頭。於是以前專制時代封建下的怪劇，乃一一重演於今日。</p>
<p>▲急來抱佛腳「人窮則呼天。急來抱佛腳」。在這科學時代，迷信兀是永遠在我國民眾心頭，佔有巨大的力量。邑紳們是提倡請銅觀音，羽士們是擺了八卦陣，上血表，和尚們也行香請願，甚至謠傳某道長願捨身求雨，火焚在三擔檳香之上。至於民眾們的掉龍燈，請龍神，更是風起雲湧，閶門外的居民，特請了紅面金龍四大王，巡行城內；面前有腳踏車隊，及天降甘霖的旗職，還有活動龍燈，漁翁捉蚌，蕩湖船等等玩意；爆竹聲聲，高升砰拍，這班人在烈日下面，還須大獻身手，表演好戲。奇形怪狀，仿佛銀幕上表演的菲洲怪劇！</p>
<p>▲臨渴掘井河水旣由綠色而成黑色；井水也由渾濁而變做枯竭。在這吃茶要水，洗澡要水，洗衣要水，用水激增的現在，那得不大起恐慌！河水袛有幾家茶寮，裝着洋鐵箱，由黃包車運送進城，貴得仿佛像玉液甘露普通一擔冷水，已達銅元三十枚。凡有自流水的商戶或住家雖自動開放供人吸用，然仍供不應求。於是一班住戶，在枯竭井中，加深開掘，以求水泉。「朱子家訓」上，會有「母臨渴而掘井」，然而在這亢旱之下，却不由你不臨渴掘井了。▲米珠薪桂年頭雖這般不景氣，旱災的局勢，已嚴重的展開在面前；田土龜坼，秧苗盡死，米商們眼瞧着所囤的米有大利可圖，於是逐日飛漲，僅僅半個月，一擔七元的米已漲到十二元外。然而瞻望來日，飛漲正烈，正不知貴到若何地步！稻柴這幾天來，也由一元三百廿斤，貴到一元一百五六十斤，在這米貴，柴貴，水貴，三般價昂之下，一班掙扎圖存的窮人，益发不能生存；於是押妻爲娼，投河自殺的慘劇，逐漸在人間地獄中一一表演，米如珠，薪如桂，瞻望來日，眞是不堪想！不認想！▲商業蕭條天是這般的熱，水是這般的少，人人心頭，都橫梗着旱災的恐慌，商店雖竭力在大減價，然而大門洞開，顧客寥寥，尤其是娛樂事業，京劇已全部歇夏，演劇的藝員，因包銀無着，竟有拍賣家具充作盤費的慘事，影戲院也由五家歇剩兩家，某處歌舞團，因欲歸無錢袛得挺身硬幹登台表演，混口飯吃。至於難簧等等也早已太都休業。各商店因商業蕭條，大都兼營冷飲事業，酸梅湯五步一灘，十步一店，然而冰店雖多，吃客太少，大都是，「座上客常空，瓶中水中少。」</p>
<p>▲救旱會議在這亢旱的嚴重局勢下，救旱的迷信方法，已一一失却效力，於是爲民父母的地方長官，和熱心人士，在縣政府聯合着開救旱會議。一方面開闢胥門涵洞，灌水進城，一方面吸引太湖和金雞湖水，灌溉農田，由田業會和縣政府以二萬元資金購大批戽水機器，邑紳張一鵬，更親率鄕民三十餘人，赴滬學習戽水技術；吳縣長更定各區區長以救荒成積的優劣，爲去留標凖，在這上下一心，努力救旱之下，冥冥的上蒼，假使不願蘇州的苦百姓，盡做涸轍之鮒，也好下些甘霖，救濟救濟這許多呼籲無門的蒼生了。</p>

<h3>紗花　紗市買風又起</h3>
<p>紗市平靜、形勢尙定、因某廠內部尙未妥恊、而報章上時有消息、於是市塲上謠言又　起、謂有停工之說、因之買風稍起、但現紗銷路轉滯、總之市面不　盤旋之局、惟本月份距交割時期日近、升降之力、全恃買方收貨興否爲轉移耳、</p>
<h3>金鷄回漲</h3>
<p>標紗前市開盤、以美棉良好、塲中賣戶不多、且某廠內部份情形複雜、一時仍難解决、停工之謠傳又起、故多頭意態尤挺、而多數之額、均在金融界手中、市氣一緊、形勢愈昂、各月均漲三四角、拍至三盤稍疲、收盤又漲、結果各月均漲三六七八角、成交統計一萬九千二百包、查賣出恒益七百包、新昌六百包、錦昌六百包、愼昌五百五十包、愼記四百五十包、仁豐七百五十包、益　一千一百包、信誠一千包、買進通記七百五十包、達記九百包、泰與一千零五十包、惠康七百包、　豐一千八百五十包、元一七百包、義成四百五十包、一日間最高低及收盤價列下、　標紗　最高價　　　最低價　　　收盤價　　　漲跌　　　存帳數</p>

<h3>交貨踴躍　近期棉市氣大虛</h3>
<p>棉市陳花市勢十分衰弱、因多頭公司之主持者、及某棉行將上月收進之貨、有二三萬担在七月份中如數套出、尙有漢帮黃帮亦交出二萬担左右、因之市氣大疲、且廠方减工停工者較多、消費减少、爲陳棉看軟之最大主因、惟新棉以外棉堅挺、人心較昂、而稍上漲、</p>
<h3>鄭標陳跌新漲</h3>
<p>標棉前市開盤、陳棉跌風又起、且形勢猛烈、以交貨擁擠、而收貨者缺乏、惟新棉因美棉堅昂、又漲五磅音、多頭義氣仍强、故市况尙未十分虛弱、不過各路皆有陣雨下降、人心稍定、結果陳花跌一角半至二角半、新花漲一角半、成交統計八萬二千一百担、查賣出同孚一千二百担、通記一千六百担、恒益一千担、大豐三千担、振大三千一百担、惠康二千担、愼昌三千二百担、元一一千五百担、長豐六千担、　生二千担、買進梅記三千六百担、源大三千六百担、　豐二千六百、担瑞大一千一百担、恒德一千二百担、泰昌一千二百担、益　一千四百担、崇安三千担、新亨二千七百担、瑞源二千五百担、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<h3>糧食　陣雨續降　粉麥一致挫落</h3>
<p>▲粉　昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份呈初　　　定繼跌之象、以洋麥報價、雖芝加哥好四角零、坎拿大好五角零、惟以久旱之後、本外埠已見甘霖、雖雨量仍未透足、但人心皇皇之際、得此似亦聊勝於無、故本月份開價雖見六分、以後各盤、即因雨而挫落、一部分之浮多、見機脫手、廠家方面、亦步拋遠期、致人心致向下、跌勢頗巨、惟最進津帮生意、已見活動、近期收價不少、即大戶之銀錢帮、聞亦繼續買進、數亦可觀故半日中之交易、亦達一百廿餘萬包之巨、照目下情形、如各地甘霖大將、秋作收穫之後、緊張之氣、自能逐漸轉平也、結果本月份又跌二分半、八月份跌二分、九十月份跌一分七厘半、十一月份跌一分二厘半、十二月份跌二分云▲麥　昨日期麥市面、均見平疲、洋麥報價　　　、芝加哥·坎拿大雖續好四五角不等、但市塲人心、因天時已轉、各地續見甘霖、所謂大旱之後、望雨如望歲、人心皇恐　即易和緩、且小麥本屬豐收、貨量並不見缺、因此一見喜雨、市面即逐鬆動、可見投機之狂抬、與事實殊相反背也、各盤開價、步見軟弱、結果本月份小一分八九月份小四分、十月份小三份、十一十二月份小二分、現麥市面、勢見平穩、到仍陸續、銷亦不敵、開浦口揚州麥三元一角、常州麥三元一角六分、山東麥三元二角七分、蔣家壩滁州麥三元二角二分、南宿州麥三元二角半、蚌埠麥三元二角四分、清江麥三元二角、江新州麥三元一角八分、由福新去一萬包、阜豐去八千包、信大去二千包云、</p>
<h3>河米因天雨續跌</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源袛到十三四號、（貨約二千餘石）而各路銷塲自甘霖綿綿、人心另換一付眼光、致多袖手觀望、未肯輕然出手、雖或動動、然爲數亦屬有限、故大局無形中呈停頓化、其後雖青島帮續有採辦、但數袛二百餘包、結果市氣終向下游、如各帮厚粳及晚稻行情較高者修去三四角、中次者一瀉五六角不等、杜洋尖及陰變元至此難免牽制、遂亦帶下角許耳、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源十四五號、市上各色銷塲因天宮突轉陰雨、致人心軟弱、零胃清淡、白粳薄稻中次及早稻價小三四角、白元價小角外、羊尖杜尖價賤一二角、埠尖亦短角許</p>
<h3>洋客秈回跌一二角</h3>
<p>昨日洋米定貨續有定交、數目價格尚未宣佈、但合價連費連稅仍須在十元左右也、貨係西貢一號圓粒長粒等、截至目下止、成交總數大約已逾十五萬包以上、在市上公佈者則不到一萬噸也、昨日因產地得雨及洋米之一再成交、人心向下、市價立即平落一二角、園戶停乎、客戶亦不似日前之亟亟收買、故昨日成交减少、全市祗有北洋辦法去湖南機靖一千包、本街去機油及糙米近千包、小絞米則由本街與甬帮共辦五千包、其他則均無進出云、</p>
<p>又訊自滬上因天旱米價飛漲後、米商即有採辦洋米以壓平市價之議、旋即有一號西貢之成交、市價已被壓低、惟通日洋商兜攬定貨甚忙、而西貢蘭貢當地市價反因此報漲、目下高西貢價申十一元、已不劃搬運矣、</p>
<h3>糖市　白糖銷路亦受天旱影響</h3>
<p>昨日糖市、趨勢平平、公會劃盤、二四粗砂白現貨十九元八角半、亦無上落、碼頭交貨、粒子較粗者十九元九角八分、轉口貨較高者六元半、普通六元四角、貨缺、太古糖B嘜呌二十元四角、原價、行家還三角、未成、本廠綿白以出貨仍少、一號十九元、挺立不動、荷亦轉口貨六元二角、潮靑近似內地上江等處天旱水道不通、銷路减色、故號盤轉定、昨什牌茹粉開六十餘包、七元半、</p>
<h3>南北貨　新金菜趨勢略定</h3>
<p>金針菜自出新以來、市價迭降、現又到低廉地位、趨勢稍見平定、昨市大與菜開十六元半、徐州菜開十五元、泉州帮共辦去二百餘包、銷胃較佳、餘均零星爲多、行盤大與菜售十七元二角、次之十六元左右、徐州菜十五元半、</p>
<h3>絲茶　紅茶暢銷綠茶呆滯</h3>
<p>昨日祁門寗州宜昌等路之紅茶、英莊天祥怡和恊和等行、及俄國恊助會、進胃均趨濃厚、全市成交二千七百餘箱、其中宜昌高莊貨、頂盤開出一百十五元、寗茶售開五十三元、價均堅挺、惟綠茶市面、轉趨呆滯、婺源屯溪等路珍眉、連日到貨衆多、但英法各莊行家、認盤均各苛緊、銷路異常呆滯云、</p>
<h3>大批新茶運俄</h3>
<p>今歲絲查、國外貿易、湖絲已受日絲之影響、據航商云、在最近二個月內、湖絲運赴歐洲者、總數不滿五百包、照往年比較、祗有百分之五、可見絲銷之不振、惟新茶外銷、尙稱不惡、但亦不若往年之旺盛、前日英倫出口、裝有一萬二千箱運往倫敦、茲聞俄國恊助會亦採購大批紅綠茶及茶磚、因俄船不敷運輸、又向本埠太古公司租得穎州輸、裝有一萬五千餘箱、今晨出口、開往海參威、轉裝中東路赴俄云、</p>
<h3>五金　德馬口鐵有人囤進</h3>
<p>德國馬口鐵因性子軟、物質美、兼之行情便宜、故廠家樂於成交、雖近在霉潮汛中、購者依然衆多、但海外電報日漲、本埠人行亦有提加可能、囤戶方面、聆此消息、以爲秋凉後必有發展之勢、下手收羅、聞昨市已被購去有二千餘箱之多、致一時人氣膨脹、行情愈見挺硬、雙連開三十元、單連售十五元一角云、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>談認眞</h3>
<p>— 母我</p>
<p>現在如果有人執行了古訓「言忠信，行篤敬」的話，一定被人家譏笑爲阿木林。因爲他太認眞的緣故。現在的人是：越會說起話來吹吹牛皮，越會做起事來虛僞奸詐，越被人家恭維。你說老實話，你做本分事，你就是阿木林。孔門弟子會參優里　氣地每日要三省，什麼爲人謀而不忠乎？與朋友交不信乎？傳不習乎?」這一種認眞的道德行爲，現在是老早在被打倒之內。現在的英雄豪傑是每日要三省那：「做事虛僞奸詐沒有？對朋友吹牛皮失信用沒有？自私主義的事做倒得沒有？一省二省三省，到了明白每日做事是虛僞奸詐的了，對朋友是吹牛皮失信用的了，自私利己的本領已經道地學到了，這才放了心。社會上人人如此，利己主義成爲道德的現在，你要認眞你就是阿木林。</p>
<p>比方你對於新文化運動認眞地想要儘一點責任，而原來那一般主張復古的人是在利用出風頭陞官發財，那一般反復古的人也在利用出風頭文壇登龍，他們一右一左都各有作用，已經將本題踢開一萬八千里，雖然社會上所受的惡影響已經不小，可是你認眞地想要儘一點對於新文化運動的責任，就偏偏只有你這種認眞的阿木林吃云。任你喊得聲嘶力竭，復古的人已經自的逹到陞官發財，站在旁邊作鷺騖笑，反復古的人討厭你不跟着他們的屁股走去談玄虛的問題，索性擗開敵人不追殺，迎面就給你一棒，弄得你受駡受打也莫名其士地堂。　　認眞的人除了被譏笑爲阿不林之外，還有，其罪狀是「神經衰弱糊裏糊塗」和「昏庸老朽沒落份子」。現在的人做一回應該學一回乖，太認眞太老實也是罪狀，大舞台對過天曉得！</p>
<h3>創痛底殘留</h3>
<p>— 枬仃</p>
<p>接到她這對來信，使我突然受了一種意外的打擊。但她對我的誠意及諒解，令我深深感到現存生命的意義和價値，這點，我是不能不掬誠去感激她了。　　可是，有一樁事情使我深覺不快的</p>
<p>||便是她近來精神上的突變，這突變，不消說是會搖撼着我們之間的信念及未來底生活的幸福的。</p>
<p>倘在我們之間設有一根熱情的綫索</p>
<p>聯繫着，這是怎樣一種可怕的變故呀！總之，倘我對她是懷着一顆失望的心，而她對我也抱着同樣的態度||灰心冷意，那末我相信在不久的將來，這不但我們無法擺脫了過去創痛的遺留，而且，從此會加速我們走上那人間慘痛的路上去，這，我相信她怎也不肯忍受。因爲我們是具着一種未來生活的憧憬，所以我們就不怕難艱的奮鬥下去。不然，我們當初何必去找尋苦惱，而且在險惡荊辣的環境之下，不顧生死的向前猛進呢！</p>
<p>可是到此刻，事實引起了我一種</p>
<p>惶惑，一種哀感的悲傷。在她一字一行的信中，充滿了無涯的人生的黑暗和殘酷，悽愴與慘痛。</p>
<p>「呵······」她說「我只有眼淚，只有</p>
<p>眼淚而已，我的血已經留盡了，我的心已經破碎了，對於人生我不復像從前那樣了······」</p>
<p>她的話，從生命最深處飛迸出來的</p>
<p>有如血淚一般的話，它感動了我，感動了像我鐵石心腸的人們。想到這，我的心更加難受。胸間仿佛有什麼東西塞着似的，呼吸是由遲緩而緊張。我簡直不能再想出一句足夠形容我心境的話了。</p>
<p>這麽着，我，缄默了一會，我的腦子開始旋轉，我在幻想着過去，躊躇着現在，恐怖着未來，我意的沒落，魔磁的伸展，想到人間的內幕，想到她。||面孔，心情，命運，爲兇燄所威脅，爲恥辱所繞纒，······我想，我在幻想一切。仿佛我已經不是生存着了。這時，我只感覺生之可怕，死的悲哀，靈魂中所藴藏着那種極度空虛的飄渺及內在生活底矛盾的苦悶，啊！我還有什麼用呢？</p>
<p>想到這，眞的，我也忍不住快要哭了，這時，我覺得哭，流淚，并不是完全一種懦弱的表示。它是在人們痛苦中最爲痛快的事。因爲哭，淚，才可以消解了我們心中的悲哀，滌清我們心理上的污點，它是最能感動人們的一種力量，由錯悞的行爲中，人們不是往往用淚來懴悔嗎？　　所以在苦痛的深淵裏，除淚足以排</p>
<p>除一些以外，我以爲世間沒有什麼東西比它更有效力了。這麼，或許有人會不齒我：你這個人太沒用了，老是這麼傷感幹嗎？，不長進的東西！</p>
<p>朋友可是，我只有一笑回答你而已············</p>
<p>在難艱困窘的日子當中，我的生活磨折够了，我的命運受襲擊，我的心血所做成的事業摧殘，在刺骨的創塲裏，我認識了這人生，我認識了這荊辣的世界。</p>
<p>對於過去的生活和現在的心境，我雖然生過了一種極端的衝突，但不久之後，爲了她對於我的熱情，爲了我的前途和事業，於是在新生的意識上消滅了我毀滅的悲哀，過去創痛的殘留，漸漸的在我的心裏排盡了去·········</p>
<h3>廢話連篇</h3>
<p>— 文丐</p>
<p>文化是人造的，可是文化常常在害人。</p>
<p>害人的文化，有人在反抗，推翻，撲滅；亦有人在維持，擁護，御用。</p>
<p>太陽與地球在日新月異地新陳代謝地將生物變化，人類現在却在開倒車地復古。假如我們的文化，恢復到「天圓地方」的信仰，而那時人人有飯吃，成爲葛天氏之民，亦是好的。</p>
<p>歌頌唐處盛世的人，假如要他宣傳起堯讓位於舜的事，那他是不幹的。</p>
<p>復古的人有的崇拜孔子，有的崇拜岳子（岳飛也），不知道有人在崇拜秦始皇沒有？可是公開崇拜袁世凱的人却是沒有了。</p>
<p>假如有那麼一天，男子都留起辮子，女人都金蓮三寸，崇拜關公的出馬提靑龍偃月刀，崇拜諸葛亮的身穿八卦衣手持羽毛扇，復古運動慶祝大會上，一定有人戴起孔子的四方帽來。</p>
<p>天旱，有道士在祭壇，有活佛在求雨，怎麼沒有人在學諸葛亮七星壇上求東風。||夏天有東風，雨一定來也。（故鄕老農曰：一斗東風三斗雨。）</p>
<p>中國同胞現在有的在水深中（北方），有的在火熱中（南方），有人提議移民，那未，調和適當，大家安樂，說是古人所訓。</p>
<h3>讀「我與文學」</h3>
<p>— 何覺夫</p>
<p>前些時，「文章做法」，「創作人間」</p>
<p>，「描寫辭典」，······這類書籍，是會當銷過一時的。後因許多讀着讀了若干部</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>這些東西之後，文章還是依舊寫不通，不敢再受編者和書店老板的騙子，以及當時一般有識者給予有力的斥責，||以爲文章本法不前定，所以這類書籍才行斂跡。續「文章作法」「創作人門」，······之後而出現的，就是「作家自傳」，「創作經騐」，······這一類。這些作品，雖不能與前者同混爲一談，但許多心急的讀者，仍舊在企望着從這裏窺出老牌作家們的寫作秘密，以爲自己進身之階；所以，這一種買賣，倒也會極枉一時。</p>
<p>大約是讀者這一顆虛弱的心，是稍路總明的人，誰都親見　到的　，所以，現在許多編者和書店老闆們，都盡向這方面賣力。</p>
<p>作爲『文學雜誌』一週紀念特輯的　我與文學，名目是較爲清新典雅的了，但其實質，也不過用『作家自傳』，『創作經騐』······之類，是一模一樣的東西而已。同時更因『文學雜誌』在現在的中國，是成爲一流的文學刊物，這書一出版，是凖保能吸引一大批心急的讀者的。</p>
<p>其實，一個作家，能够將他自已是如何長成過來的穩種，忠忠實實她直書出來，給予讀者借　，這的確也是有益的，問類之難，是在於睜　眼睛對人說私事，總免不了要有多少誇張，矯飾，歪曲，······的這點。有人說，自己道自己的事情眞確，我想，這理由是不十多充足的。　　打開三百多頁的『我與文學』，細心看看五六個作家說話的口吻，是有趣極了··有的說，他與文學是無緣的，有的說，他是不得已才跑上文學的路的，有的說，他對於文學袛是一個旁觀者而已，有的說，他袛是文藝園中的一個小園丁而已，有的說，他對於文學是怎樣的愛好和感到有趣，有的說，他是如何的困苦艱難在文學的路上跑，有的也提供出他自己對於文學的見地，理解和主張，是怎樣怎樣；甚且，有的更將自己的若干部著作介紹出來，樣子好像是在敎讀者可以買來讀讀似的；有的更確斷地指出他的那一本那一部作品，是曾轟動整個社會，打動了若干讀衆的心弦，敎讀者讀來，不禁爲他的偉大而拜倒（？）有的更將自己的過去，寫成一個聰明絕頂的神童，敎鈍魯的人讀來，不敢再做文學的夢；有的更擺出紳士的臭架子，敎從事創作的人，一定要取了什麼態度，抱着什麼宗旨，酸溜的氣燄，流溢於字裏行間；······總之，這裏所包容採納的，眞是光怪陸離，無所不有了。但有一點是共同的，就誰個的過去，都是光榮的，美滿的，誰個的寫作態度，都是忠實的，誠摯的，誰個對於未來的希望，都是欲走上『新』的道路的！</p>
<p>心急的讀者。要欲從這裏找尋一條捷徑來走，準是會失望的；不過，人的才分，人的環境，人的思想，不是在同一的模型中打出來的，而宇宙間的事事物物，又是時時刻刻在轉變着，要强一個先進的作者指告你那一條路可走。其走法是該怎樣，這當然是萬不可能的事；先進者袛能將他的經騐赤赤裸裸地直書出來，以爲後進者借鑑，這就算是滿足的了；可惜的，是連足以借鑑的地方，在這裏也不多見的這一點。</p>
<p>出一本書，如果不是站在功利方面，（指對於社會讀衆而言。）而袛是出來玩玩而已，那當無話可說；如果其企圖原不是這樣，那未免是無益的浪費了。</p>
<p>編者在引言中說：『······我們這次，徴文實於無意中盡了一點文學史的使命，不止是凑凑熱鬧而已。還有不少篇數，簡直是各作家文學生活的詳細自傳，料想到百數十年之後，這些文章也許要成爲文學史的珍貴資料，我們又怎能忽視呢？』這或許是因在編者的地位，也袛能這麼說吧！</p>
<h3>中國的狗</h3>
<p>— 阿鳳</p>
<p>前日濟南通訊本市野狗素多，現在洪字廠附近之犬牢內，已收容二千餘頭　旣不能向外運送，每日尙須飼養，特請准韓省主席，在千佛山下，將該二千餘頭野狗，執行槍决，眞是可憐，</p>
<p>現在各國擴充海軍，製造飛艇，大家厲兵秣馬，摩拳擦掌，預備在二次世界大戰時，太殺一陣，但是警犬，亦爲戰時極需要的一種工具，因此各國不惜鉅資，大事收買，訓練成軍，我想到二次世界大戰時，幾只警犬，必定要大出其風頭呢，</p>
<p>或謂外國警犬，飲的是牛乳，吃的是牛肉，所以外國的狗，很强壯，很靈敏，而中國的狗，連飯腳水多還不能吃飽，那裏會强壯得來，靈敏得來呢？倘然中國的狗，也同外國的狗一樣優待，則中國的狗，未始不可收發縱指示的用呢，</p>
<p>我說這話不對，中國的狗，無諭你用甚麼好的東西給他吃，恐怕越吃越懶惰，越吃越昏庸，所以無人顧問，只有送到千佛山去槍斃，中國雖沒有警狗，但是另一種狗，出產到非當之多，非常之著名，這種是什麼狗呢　就是日本臭常廠迎的走狗</p>
<h3>文人無形</h3>
<p>— 穆琳</p>
<p>駡人果然是痛快，然而被駡郤被人家痛快去了，所以想自己痛快的時候要預防著人家痛快的時候。　　駡人這套把戲如今在文壇上鬧到夠熱鬧。過去的例實在太多，從打麻將起，莊子文選，徐何事件······以至文白大衆語，而影壇上也軟硬的交鋒起來。起初尚不失爲文人態度，作理論上的批評，漸漸的戰區大擴，戰員加多，漸由理論而漫駡起來，再不然，就攻擊個人的秘密，以致毫無結果，各自收蓬。守候機會，再作第二次的預備||這不是我故意造謠，曾有某作家寫信給某刊編者，向進來貴刊爲什麼不駡人了，此公眞是惟恐天下不亂？　　影壇上的軟硬之爭，也是鬧得一塌糊塗。在沙發上沉下去的紳士們，四面楚歌的時候卻放出文人最後的手段來，說硬性是左傾」，（硬性軟性不在本文討論之內，也不袒護某方。）文人用施用這般毒辣的手段似乎太無恥了？</p>
<p>時至今日，文人真是末路的末路了，處處受着各方的箝制，或因下筆不愼，而引起絕大的糾紛，同類還要自相殘殺，不知是何居心？</p>
<h3>「文學遺產問題」的疑問</h3>
<p>— 林嘯</p>
<p>「歐風東漸」，這句話似乎已經是成爲老調了，但實實在在，現在有許多事情，還用得着這麼一句。譬如裸體運動，本來是發源於德國，不久也就「東漸」了。又譬如什麼主義之類，也老是由外國販進來的。可憐，咱們貴國是一個落後的國家，事事祗有跟着文「明之邦的」屁股後面跑，但跟個屁股後面跑不打緊，可惜有許多事情是不甚適宜的，借來了大帽子放在尖頭上，就算是時髦的帽子，也顯得難看。　　近來，文學遺產的問題，也一樣地從外國販進來了·聰明之士，也就認眞的討論起來。他們的結論是：檢討，檢討，揚棄了有毒質的東西，繼承可賓貴的材料。但結論也祗做到這一步罷了。究竟什麼是中國的遺產呢？有毒質的東西是什麼？可賓貴的材料是什麼？沒有人具體地指示出來。我根本懷疑：拿現在的尺寸來衡量過往。文學作品之存在，是歷史上價值的存在。若果拿現在的繩索來套在古人的頭上，說那一此應該「揚」，那一些應該「棄」，簡直是可笑的事。中國過去停在封建時代的日子多，可以說大多數的作品都是帶有封建意識的。如果我們要檢討文學遺產的「毒質」，我們將沒有什麼「可賓貴」的遺產可言。例如「楚辭」吧。若就歷史上的價值來說，無論如何也是存在的。但拿現在的尺寸來量，「楚辭」將是含有毒質的東西，它含有忠君懷主的思想，｜借香草美人來訴說一個逐臣的哀思。在「現代」的意義上是可笑的意識，除了滿洲國鄭孝胥之流是不需要這種意識的。但「楚辭」究竟算得是一部偉大的作品嗎？則恐無人敢加以否認！不說「楚辭」，再來舉兩本公認的偉大的文學作品吧，譬如水滸傳，紅樓夢，當可作「可賓貴」的材料的，然而水滸傳據說也是意識不健全的，例如着力描寫的宋江，就祗望朝廷招安。紅樓夢呢？這些公子哥兒千金小姐嘍嘍囌囌的戀愛，也不過是「身邊瑣事」的敘述。這些這些，全是有毒質的東西，應該「棄」之如敝屣的。那末「揚」的東西呢？可以直接了當的答道，沒有！古的典東西，封建時代的東西，全是些有毒质的，從「五四時代」以來，可惜又時間甚短，沒有留下點什麼，（有人說祗留下一個阿Q的面影。）這樣！若依現代的衡量家拿標準尺去衡量，不是祖宗祗有許多臭皮囊遺下，使我們失望又失望了嗎？</p>
<p>然而：問題並不是如此的。我以爲這些錯處，就在所謂「重新估價」這一點上。我們要知道歷史的進程是永久的我們的現在，不過歷史進程中的一刹那對過去文學遺產，我們作為歷史上的價値，作爲研究過往的材料而保存，而分析，那是必要，若拿一刹那的階段來估定永久歷史上的價值，這對於歷史價值的客觀存在性這一點上是忽略了的。</p>
<p>總之，文學作品的價值，是歷史上的價值，它的價值是不會隨近代人的「標準」而轉移的，所謂「選擇」，「揚棄」問題，對於文學自身的價值並沒有觸摸着什麼！</p>
<p>那末，「接受遺產」問題與「整理國故」又有什麼分別？</p>
<p>由外國販進來的時髦名詞，縱使說得滿口漂亮，但畢竟是一項大帽子，顯得更難看的吧。</p>

<h3>主意不定</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>敝人的祖父母生有兒子三個，最長者是我的父親，已去世二十三年。我父遺下的苦命兄弟二個，哥哥嗣與堂叔。我的二叔父，握有鉅萬家私，現年五十歲，還沒有兒子，但他在今年四月，抱了一個野姓的兒郎，請了幾位戚友，呌敝人押字承認，繼續門戶產業。據族中人說，姪子有平分產業，應得權利。世間那有見財不取的人，所以我就想設法干涉。但敝人初小畢業，智識有限，對於法律事情，不甚明白，恐受旁人愚弄，不敢冒昧做去，因此主意不定，如墮五里霧中，故特懇求編者先生，賜教爲幸，此請編安飛蓬鞠躬</p>
<p>答宗祧繼承制度現在已經廢除了，現在民法上的繼承是專就遺產歸屬而言。在宗祧承繼制度下，宗祧歸何人繼承，遺產亦歸何人繼承，但在現制下，宗祧與遺產繼承却是截然兩事。換句話說，姪兒對於叔父，在舊習慣上雖有繼承宗祧的資格，但在專解决遺產歸屬問題的現行繼承法，却沒有繼承遺產的權利了。你叔父沒有兒子，但他現抱有養子，照現行法律，他的養子是與婚生子女同樣有享受遺產權利的。你雖然是他的姪兒，但你却沒有權利，他的遺產你　以不應再作妄想了</p>

<h3>大衆語的建設與電影</h3>
<p>— 旭人</p>
<p>我們知道，［先要提倡大衆語。建立大衆語，然後用大衆語來敎育大衆，普及敎育］。因爲電影是有敎育的啓發性。我們應該怎樣的確立大衆語來［傅逹反帝，反封建，反宗敎的思想給大衆］。首先，必須要做到這一部份，就是目前和將來的電影，不再爲了少爺小姐們而製作了，引用［名優之死］裹的一段話，［現在咱們得讓老百姓看了咱們的戲醒覺過來］，換句話說，目前和將來的電影是要給大衆看的。</p>
<p>大衆語文學是要使大衆能說，能聽，能讀，能寫，當然這裹是包含了看得懂，聽得清，寫得出等等。在電影藝術這一部門裹，除了性質上是不能寫得出以外，從主題積極性的發展，還得使大衆更澈底的了解，這是形式和内容統一的問題了。我們試看目前中國電影的題材，已漸漸地接近大衆的實生活，但是因爲銀幕上的語言是和大衆實生活裹的語言開的，題材的内容，依然不爲大衆所懂得。雖然有聲電影的機械精良，充其份祇能做到使聲音清晰，聽得清楚而已。對白上採用的國語（大衆稱爲官話）大衆是不是在聽覺上能够得到充分的了解呢？至於無聲電影，我們想到［人道］裹的字幕，和目前一般的運用散文詩式漂亮的白話文做字幕，這問題正緊接着文學上大衆語的建設，迫切地需要着更進一步的討論。</p>
<p>關於怎樣建設大衆語，這是一個極嚴重的問題，我個人以爲目前文壇上各人提出的意見，正是一個極有力的臂助，等問題的討論進展到某一階段，確立了某一種適於大衆實生活的語言以後，［因爲電影較文學格外有着實騐的效果］，不妨將那種語言搬到銀幕來，作一個實地的試騐，以期大衆語的建設之完成。</p>
<p>這樣，語言旣是大衆所懂得的，那末，電影的内容也一般的容昜被大衆所了解。那時，統治者們再要像利用白話一樣來利用大衆語作麻醉大衆的工具，因爲大衆語本身發展健全，一定不會逹到他們的目的。大衆旣能了解現實，像那種不和大衆實生活接近的内容，無疑地，有會受到大衆的排斥的必然性。</p>
<p>正如文壇上大舉進攻桐城派的堡壘一樣，我們應該聯合一條反帝反封建反宗敎的戰　影綫，向神怪，武侠，偵探，愛情等影片復活的陣地殺去。在殭屍復活的包圍中，共同重奠中國文化的基礎。這個成功不是少數人的力量，正是大家努力的結果。</p>
<p>▲編者注：這是關於［大衆語與電影的第三篇文字，編者謹再以毫無成見的態度，將它表白出來。不敏</p>

<h3>評［出水芙蓉］</h3>
<p>— 巽之</p>
<p>ＬｏＶｅＮｅＶｅｒＡｇａｉｎ南京</p>
<p>德國聲片的發逹，比美國落後三年；直到一九三○年，德國方才產生了可以正式地和美國聲片頡頏的作品。一九三○年前後德國政治上社會上有了些什麽變動，在這兒可以不必多講。在此要讀者注意的，是在這種不景氣的不安的社會狀態之下，和電影企業瀕於没落的悲運並行，藝術的和意識方面的没落，也成了一個顯著的特徴。在德國聲片，我們已經看不到默片時代的良心的藝術的作品。除出一二小公司在三一年前後還製作過一兩部嚴肅的作品之外，大部分都已經統制在國社黨的電影國策之下，所以在現在的德國電影，［他的使命已經不在解明現代社會的嚴肅的問題，而在對人類鼓吹樂天主義，和使觀衆幻覺着在生活裏面，還有所謂幸福和喜悅的存在］。［龍翔鳳舞］［霓裳仙子］（Ｒｏｎ</p>
<p>ｎｙ）這一類鼓歌劇的盛行，他的社會根據在此，痴情，戀愛，性感，Ｓｏｐｈｉｓｔｉ</p>
<p>ｆｉｃａｔｉｏｎ，它的使命是在使終生勞苦的人們暫時的安息一下，消散了對於現實的不平，而馴服於現實的環境。除出盲目者之外，對於這些色情影片，大槪是無法否定這種儼存的作用了吧。</p>
<p>［出水芙蓉］，是這種色情主義的喜歌劇之一，甜蜜的空想，性感的汜濫，男主人公，是一個除出和女人們厮混，和替女人們簽支票这外别無生活的花花公子，女主人公是一個除出用性感來和男子競爭之外别無人生的女子，支票簿一張張地簽下去，五萬，三萬，一點兒也不必顧慮，看了這樣的影片，你假使是一個對生活還須顧慮的人物，那是一定會使你感到這是［人間何世］的。</p>
<p>導演ＡｎａｔｏｌＬｉｔＶｅｋ除出對話的節省和音樂的應用外，别無長處，前半介紹太長，入後亦嫌散漫瑣碎。但在剪接上多少還可以看到一點德國片特有的優點。</p>

<h3>梅蕙絲的俚語　係根據莎士比亞的</h3>
<p>— 西復</p>
<p>電影明星們都有雙重個性的。一種係銀幕上所表現的，亦就是觀衆們所知道而相信的。還有一種係他們眞實的個性，就是私人生活中的個性，將這兩種個性分得最清楚，而能小心不使它的混雜的，要算梅蕙絲（ＭａｅＷｅｓｔ）爲第一了。這位派拉蒙的明星在銀幕上是以葫蘆式的身軀摇擺着以示淫蕩的但她却是一個很規矩的人。她從來不肯夜裏在外面取樂，而失却睡眠的。她在銀幕上，咬了一支長長的象牙烟咀，喝着香檳酒，但她要私生活裏，係不吸烟，不喝酒的。她亦不誘惑男子，使他們到她的私室裏去的。她非但在銀幕上和在私生活中，個性完全不同，就是在她接見新聞麗琳哈蕙主演［出水芙蓉］中之一幕│南京映</p>
<p>記者的時候，她亦維持着一個特殊的個性，因爲新聞記者不是傅逹行動意思給一般大衆的媒介嗎？她在接見新聞記者的時候，她是滿口粗俗俚語的，但她在她的家裏和僕役們說話，或是和知已的朋友們談話的時候，她是一句俚語不會說的。她的理由是大衆喜歡她［壞］所以她就不得不裝［壞］了。</p>
<p>梅蕙絲有一次笑着和一位朋友道：［你知道誰是俚語（Ｓｌａｎｇ）的老祖師？誰最先發明（ＤｏｎｅｍｅＷｒｏｎｇ）的那句俗語的？那位朋友一時對答不出來。梅於是笑道：［就是大詩翁莎士比亞］。那位朋友瞠然不解道：［莎士比亞？他那裏說過這種話的？］梅道：［當然是莎士比亞。你不信去查一查，就知道了。照我所知道的，莎士比亞是俚語的老祖師呀！］</p>
<h3>他們的同病相憐</h3>
<p>— 覆</p>
<p>有一次兩個外籍明星，在深思重重地討論着一個問題。一位是法國男明星茂立斯·希佛萊；一位是德國明星瑪琳·黛德麗許。有一位不規矩的人，就去竊聽了一下。你知道他們二人討論的什麽？原來他們討論的是，他們住在好萊塢太久了，他們不久就要失去本國的口音了。茂立斯說道：［我要是不用法國口音來講英語，是得不到什麽趣味的。但是我的法國口音已經漸漸遺失了，而有意假造的法國口音，其效果亦不及眞的法國口音十分之一］。他這樣說着，瑪琳是默默地點着頭嘆息着，表示無限的同情和惋惜。但是人家不知道的看見了還常他們發生了戀愛，但因爲德法世營而發生了阻礙哩！</p>
<h3>好萊塢的傾向社會主義者</h3>
<p>— 福</p>
<p>你知道好萊塢明星們當中，有多少是傾向新社會主義的人？確數雖不得而知，但據人調查，是極多的。這些人當中，有幾個是自認贊成社會主義，毫不爲偉的。第一個是詹姆士賈南（Ｊａｍｅｓ</p>
<p>Ｃａｇｎｅｖ）。他贊成社會主義以至於亦贊成共產主義。他常常鼓吹將人類自貧苦之中解放出來。還有一位華倫威廉（Ｗ</p>
<p>ａｒｒｅｎＷｉｌｌｉａｍ）。他常說［那是上不能</p>
<p>對天，下不能對人的罪過，爲什麽人有些人有遊艇和羅爾斯樂意斯汔車，而其餘的人連衣食都不足呢？這是絕無理由的，不過在現在愚拙的經濟制度之下，他們無緣無故的犧牲了。李屈山ＬｅｅＴ</p>
<p>ｒａｃｙ常常憤憤地說：［人太自私自利了。他們眼見著財富與貧窮並分存在著，而不想到用倘使他們能用一個合乎理智，籌劃週詳的經濟政策，來將現狀改革一下，那富人不失其爲安樂，而窮人就不用那麽啼飢號寒了。</p>
<p>好萊塢的一般明星們，每星期享受了數千元的薪水，收入是着實可觀的。所以他們一旦躋身於昨星之列，今天訂合同，明天一切房屋，汽車，别墅，花園，統通有了。當然是人間最痛快事而是萬千不幸者，所望塵莫及的。但不知這幾位贊成社會主義的，他們做了什麽事，爲貧民謀福利的？</p>

<p>這時外邊突然起了一陣嘈雜之聲。一回兒吉爾克竟排開了警衛直衝進來，後面還跟着兩個人，一個是那個混蛋史博資伍德，一個是傻公爵尼古拉斯。麥迪生連忙對着吉爾克怒叱道：這是什麽！］吉爾克大聲道：［你不知道嗎？他又指着那個公主道：［你看。她並不是什麽公主呀！她就是蘭因耐雪，那個失踪的女子！我現在可以證明她了········史博德！拉開那幅帳幕！］史博資伍德得了一聲命令，立即走上前去，將一幅帳幕拉了開來···裹面赫然站着一個人···那就是託龍尼亞國王，安納託爾第二世！他對着格萊興狂喊道：［我的女兒在那裹：］公主道：［爸爸，我在這裹呀××××××××××］她說一一大串的託龍尼亞的語言。］雪雪］！安納託爾狂喊道。［雪雪，我的雪雪！］吉爾克一看情景不對，連忙喊着史博資伍德道：［快逃！快逃！還不快逃嗎？］於是他們抱頭鼠竄而去了。尼古拉斯傻氣十足地在進門的地方楞住了。他張開一個大嘴，一時闔不攏來。安納託爾於掉轉頭來對着他道：［××××××××××］大槪是用託龍尼亞的土語在駡他吧！雪雪趁着這個機會向她父親撒嬌道：［爸爸，當然我此後萬萬不能再嫁給尼古拉斯了。你看這件事讓他弄得多糟呀！他笨到那樣，連我都不認識了！我是知道他的錯誤的，但是，爸爸，你也不用和他生氣了］。公主又對着麥迪生道：［請你走進那個帳幕裹時一等。］她說着，不禁托着嘴，自已倫笑了一下。</p>
<p>麥迪生連忙答應着［是···是···小姐···］她說着，退進那幅帳幕裹去了。那幅帳幕裹面，没有别人，祇有耐雪在等着，她穿了她自已原來的衣服，將一張簇新的支票，格萊與給她的，揣在她胸衣裹面。她看見麥迪生進來了，就喊道：［哈囉···哈囉···逹令（即心肝寳貝的意思）］。麥迪生被她這麽一喊，双楞住了。他不是剛才和她在跳舞廳分别的嗎？怎麽她又在這裹呢？他思了一想，才恍然大悟道：［哦，原來吉爾克是對的。你是一個騙子！你是一個胃名頂替的人！］耐雪聽見他駡她，也一些不生氣，她了一些不解釋。她知道以後解釋的時候多着哩。還有多少年都講不清哩！她就盼望着這若干年的歲月！於是她又喊了：［哈羅···哈囉···逹令：］她的眼晴對他嘲笑着。她抿着一個小嘴，包含着無限說不出的深情。一回兒麥迪生亦不能再生氣了。這不是他所眞心疼愛的女人嗎？難道一定要是公主，才愛她的嗎？他於是將她抱了起來。他吻着她···吻着她···（完）</p>

<h3>Huang Fu Sends Yin Lei to Handle War Zone Negotiations; Wang Kemin Responds to Huang's Summons to Go South</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Huang Fu telegraphed summoning Wang Kemin to Hangzhou. Wang left Beiping today for Shanghai, then on to Mogan Mountain. Regarding the war zone issue, Huang has dispatched Yin Tong and Lei Shourong as representatives to negotiate with the Japanese side. Huang intends to hand over specific measures to Lei, who is now carrying these measures from Beiping. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A visitor returning from Mogan Mountain reported that Huang Fu feels that North China diplomacy is thorny with many difficulties. He personally still holds his previous attitude of "jumping into the fire pit," seeking gradual solutions under the two major principles of not ceding sovereignty and not humiliating the nation. Recently, Vice Foreign Minister Tang Youren went to Mogan Mountain to visit Huang. Huang is seeking concrete measures from the central government regarding the various points of the current negotiations. When necessary, he will still send personnel in a private capacity to negotiate the abolition of the Tanggu Truce. Huang hopes for this very much. When he returns north, he may propose a simultaneous resolution of the war zone incident. Huang's trip south this time is to seek instructions from the central government on North China diplomacy and improve administration, so his return north will certainly yield concrete results. The date of Huang's return north is currently undecided. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Lei Shourong stated that reports of Huang's passive attitude are inaccurate. The North China situation is not hopeless. Yin Tong will return to Beiping to resume his duties in a few days. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng went to the Tongxian Public Office this morning to handle official business and returned to Beiping in the evening. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Lei Shourong went to Mogan Mountain to meet with Huang Fu and discussed Sino-Japanese diplomatic issues. He returned to Beiping on the morning of the 18th. According to him, the meeting with Huang only touched on the situation in Japan and did not discuss anything else. The report that he had carried a war zone negotiation plan back to Beiping is purely speculation. Huang, due to the hot weather, will probably not descend the mountain to travel north until autumn. Yin Tong has dispelled his intention to resign and will return to Beiping in a few days. Regarding the abolition of the Tanggu Truce, it is heard that the Japanese side has not yet expressed agreement. According to Lei's observation, this truce is a type of agreement temporarily concluded to halt military action and has nothing to do with politics. It is now a thing of the past. It is appropriate to abolish it, but otherwise, it is harmless. Lei's trip to Japan was to investigate recent Japanese construction, purely a private action. (18th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) Yin Tong stated that the difficulty in resolving the North China issue lies in the conflict between the national policies of China and Japan. Unlawful incidents such as Japanese and Korean vagrants trafficking in firearms and narcotics in the war zone will be handled through Sino-Japanese consultation on measures to suppress them to maintain local order. After the reception of Malan峪, the former Qing Dynasty clan member Zaitao will be invited to organize a management committee, joined by local officials, to handle the management and repair of the imperial tombs, and troops will be stationed to provide effective protection. Regarding the news of the critical situation of the Luan River railway bridge due to severe flooding, the bureau reports that it is still seventeen feet short. An engineering train has been dispatched for protection, and there is no immediate danger. The railway tracks near the Liushouying camp on the Beining Railway, which were washed away by the flood, have been completely repaired. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) The diplomatic commissioner of Chahar Province, Yue Kaixian, went to Mogan Mountain to meet with Huang Fu, requesting instructions on the diplomatic response in eastern Chahar, and met with Yin Tong to discuss everything. He will pass through Hangzhou to Shanghai this morning and then go to Beiping to handle diplomatic incidents with Japan in Chahar Province. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Malan峪: Japanese and Puppet Troops Not Completely Withdrawn; Part of Them Lingering in Qian'an</h3>

According to a report from a certain source, the Japanese and puppet troops that have already departed total 170 infantrymen, 30 cavalrymen, 6 fighter reconnaissance planes, 10 cannons, and 10 cars. Unexpectedly, when a part of the Japanese and puppet troops passed through Qian'an, they happened to encounter the local security corps on patrol. The Japanese army, on the pretext that the corps intended to obstruct them, remained in the county. As for the Japanese and puppet troops who have not yet departed, they are still stationed in Malan峪. (18th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Taiwan Holds South China Consular Conference</h3>
<p>(Xiamen) A report from Taiwan states that the Taiwan Governor-General's Office is holding a South China consular conference. It opened at 9:00 AM on the 18th and will last three days, closing after the meeting at 4:00 PM on the 20th. Attending are the Japanese Consul in Xiamen, Tsukamoto Takeshi; the Japanese Consul in Fuzhou, Usami; the Japanese Consul in Shantou, Harada; the Japanese Consul in Guangzhou, Hattori; and the Japanese Consul in Hong Kong, Ashino. The Director-General of the Governor-General's Office, Hiratsuka, is the chairman. At the opening, the Governor-General will read out the rescript withdrawing from the League of Nations and the Governor-General's Office's hopes and policies for the conference. The agenda includes colonial industries, police affairs, communications and education, justice, and army and navy matters. Taiwan will announce the purpose of the conference across the strait, because there are many Taiwanese people in various places across the strait, to passively protect these people, actively seek economic advances and retreats, cultural contributions, and to complete Sino-Japanese friendship, etc. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>The South China Consular Conference opened in Taipei this morning. After Taiwan Governor-General Nakagawa delivered a speech, Director-General Hiratsuka served as the chairman and started the discussion. The official announcement of today's discussion results is as follows: (1) Reviving the Foreign Affairs Section within the Governor-General's Office. In order to develop South China, it is especially necessary to revive the Foreign Affairs Section. This section, in coordination with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, manages all diplomatic matters in South China. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has agreed, so it is decided to re-establish this section from next year. (2) Restoring the market in South China. In order to further expand the market, each consul must actively investigate the market or promote Japanese goods. (3) The Shantou Consul, Takeuchi, proposed that Taiwanese people be allowed to freely go to China for economic inspection. The chief of the document section, Nozawa, gave this a principled approval, and said that the Governor-General's Office is prepared, but the difficulty lies in preventing the inflow of Chinese revolutionary ideas into Taiwan, and the coming and going of unstable elements (anti-Japanese thinkers) among the Taiwanese people to China. (4) Plantation Bureau Director Ueda inquired about methods for dumping Taiwanese coal. The consuls in Hong Kong and Guangzhou both replied that they could only wait for the easing of anti-Japanese sentiment. (5) Ueda also asked each consul to mediate the promotion of Taiwanese canned pineapples. (6) The Xiamen consul, Tsukamoto, proposed that Taiwanese people be moved to Fujian to start industries. Ueda promised to investigate and prepare concretely. (18th China United News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Mantetsu Director-General Arrives in Beiping to Discuss Joint Transportation, etc.; Will Meet with Gu Mengyu</h3>
<p>(Beiping) In order to seize economic hegemony in the Northwest, the Japanese have sent Sogou to Beiping to negotiate the connection and joint transportation of the Beining and PingSui Railways. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After arriving in Beiping last night, Gu Mengyu stayed at the German Hotel. This morning, Li Shizeng visited him, followed by Shen Chang, the director of the PingSui Railway Bureau. At 11:00, Gu visited He Yingqin. According to Gu Zhengding, the secretary of the Ministry of Railways, Gu usually comes north in the summer to escape the heat, so this trip to Beiping has no deeper meaning. As for the impeachment case, Gu's attitude is indifferent and he does not attach importance to it. After seeing He Yingqin, he went to the Western Hills and will return to Nanjing in two weeks. In other news, Gu's visit is not only to inspect the floods on the PingSui Railway, but also to meet with Sogou, the Director-General of Mantetsu, for consultations. It is heard that Sogou is on his way, and Gu's visit may be related to railway joint transportation and economic cooperation issues. Shen Chang went to Zhuozishan to inspect the floods. Because Gu came to Beiping, he rushed back to Beiping this morning to meet Gu and report everything. Shen said that the water from Zhuozishan to Fushengzhuang has receded. The railway tracks between Zhuo and Fu were repaired yesterday, but the damage is very serious. More than 200 zhang of the roadbed were washed away, and the water has not receded, so repair is very difficult. Traffic between Sui and Baotou has been restored. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sogou, the Director-General of Mantetsu, departed from Shenyang to Beiping. It is heard that he will discuss joint transportation matters with our transportation authorities. (18th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Tangshan Hold Exercises; Traitors Actively Engage; Vagrants Roam in Gangs</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese troops stationed in Tangshan conducted combat exercises at the Xishan shooting range from 8:00 AM on the 18th until noon. Merchants and residents were once again subjected to false alarms because they did not know about it beforehand. (18th Dispatch) (Tianjin) The problem of Han Zexin, the leader of the Yutian security team, has occurred. Shi Yousan sent a former subordinate named Ma to Tangshan to engage in secret activities. On the 18th, he detoured through Yutian and lingered there. Li Shoushan and Bai Jianwu, the division commanders of Shi's troops, have also recently had representatives in Tangshan contacting a certain party. At the same time, Zhang, the adjutant of Li Jichun's troops, came to Tangshan on the 16th to contact the representatives of Li and Bai. Therefore, traitors have gathered in Tangshan in recent days, forming a reactionary nexus. On the 17th, Japanese vagrants in Tangshan roamed the streets in gangs, arbitrarily firing shotguns, causing the whole city to be alarmed several times a day without knowing the truth. The Public Security Bureau sent personnel to stop them, saying that they were hunting birds, but they did not listen. (18th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) According to the report from the Huilongmiao measuring station, the water level of the Yongding River has dropped to eleven Chinese feet, a decrease of seven feet compared to this morning. All sections along the river are still under defense. After the Chaobai River and the Sha River in northern Beiping surged, bridges were destroyed and traffic has been interrupted for two weeks. The construction bureaus of various counties are unable to repair them due to a shortage of funds. They are still relying on ferries to maintain traffic in northern Beiping.

<p>(Dalian) The Nen River railway bridge near Ang'angxi, south of Qiqihar, was washed away by the water, causing traffic on the Chinese Eastern Railway between Manchuria and Harbin to be interrupted today. Two thousand packages of Siberian mail are currently blocked in Harbin, because an area of 75 square miles south of the Lalin River has been flooded and trains cannot run. The section of the Chinese Eastern Railway 145 miles south of Harbin that was washed away by the water yesterday has not yet been repaired. It is heard that the flood in the Rehe and Luan River areas in recent days has caused disasters, with insufficient food, epidemics, many deaths, and no agricultural harvests.

<p>(Beiping) After being blocked in Pingdiquan, Fu Zuoyi went to Zhuozishan with Shen Chang on a railcar to inspect the damage to the PingSui railway line and the disaster conditions in the local areas along the way. After Fu arrived in Zhuozishan, because provincial affairs were waiting to be handled, he telegraphed the Sui provincial government to dispatch a long-distance bus to pick him up and return to the province. However, it is not known whether the trip can be made because the water after the rain in eastern Sui has not completely receded. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Part of the PingSui Railway Tracks Have Been Repaired</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Shen Chang's inspection of the water situation along the PingSui line resulted in the conclusion that the water on the three sections of the PingSui line has now receded. In the first western section, from Guihua to Baotou, about 200 zhang were washed away by the water. After repairs, traffic has been restored. In the second eastern section, from Pingdiquan to Zhuozishan, more than 300 zhang were washed away, and traffic has now been restored. In the third middle section, from Fushengzhuang to Sandaoying, the damage was very severe. The water has now receded, but due to the excessive losses, it is impossible to repair it temporarily. The railway bureau plans to build a new track along the mountainside to bypass the area. This plan will be submitted to the Ministry of Railways for approval. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shen Chang returned to Beiping on the morning of the 18th. According to him, the water from Zhuozishan to Fushengzhuang on the PingSui railway has receded, and the roadbed has also been repaired.

Otherwise, traffic from Suiyuan to Baotou is unimpeded. (18th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry Prepares an Outline of Drought Prevention and Relief</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan has decided to establish a Drought Relief Office, and the Ministry of Industry is now actively preparing the specific relief plan, which will be submitted to the Executive Yuan's temporary meeting on the morning of the 21st for discussion. It is heard that the outline of this specific plan is: 1. The office plans to set up three sections: general affairs, purchasing, and guidance. 2. The funding is set at one million yuan. Originally, it was planned to spend 800,000 yuan to purchase seeds and 200,000 yuan for operating expenses. It is heard that the allocation has now been changed as follows: 900,000 yuan to purchase seeds, 80,000 yuan for travel expenses for guidance in various places, and 20,000 yuan for office expenses. 3. The guidance methods are drought relief and post-disaster recovery. (18th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Industry believes that to relieve the drought, the Forestry and Land Reclamation Department and the Agricultural Department should study it separately. A preliminary plan has been drafted, focusing on the impact of food in terms of short-term measures, strictly prohibiting food from being used for brewing wine and food exports, and setting food prices and restricting price increases when necessary. In terms of long-term measures, trees should be widely planted and water conservancy projects should be dredged. The date of establishment of the Drought Relief Office will be after the three provincial governments and two municipal governments agree on a plan on the 21st. There are rumors that the government is considering bulk purchases of foreign rice due to fears of food shortages. According to the responsible authorities, there is no such motivation at present. The main point is still to strictly prohibit grain merchants from hoarding and smuggling exports, and as long as there is proper management, there should be no shortage. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan telegraphed the Jiang, Zhe, and Wan provincial governments, and the Jing and Hu municipal governments, to send personnel to Nanjing to attend the temporary meeting on the 21st to discuss drought relief measures, and ordered them to bring reports on the drought conditions in each province to Nanjing, so that the severity can be determined and relief can be distributed accordingly. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Rural Reconstruction Association advocated setting up a Central Grain Transportation Bureau to purchase 750,000 dan of foreign rice to relieve the drought. The Executive Yuan handed it over to the Ministries of Interior, Industry, and Finance for joint review. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Gan Garrison Orders Stabilization of Rice Prices in Southern Jiangxi</h3>
<p>(Nanchang) Prices in southern Jiangxi are extremely high, often several times higher than those in the provincial capital. The people are suffering. Although it is due to the large number of troops and high consumption, the manipulation by unscrupulous merchants and the abandonment of their original occupations by farmers and workers to engage in transportation has reduced production. The garrison has ordered the commanders of each district to order each county to stabilize prices and promote bandit suppression and social stability. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Xiangyang Suffers from Another Flood</h3>
<p>(Hankou) The commissioner of the Eighth District, Li Jianai, urgently telegraphed that Xiangyang has suffered another flood.

<h3>President Wang Has No Plans to Go to the Northwest</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain important person in the Executive Yuan said that President Wang has no plans to go to the Northwest for inspection. The report is inaccurate. As for whether Chairman Jiang will go, it is not known. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Supervisory Committee Issues Statement Refuting Wang's Remarks in Shanghai; The Central Political Council Cannot Directly Interfere with the Independent Exercise of Power of the Five Yuan</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) President Wang issued a statement in Shanghai yesterday regarding amending the impeachment case method. Concerned that this matter was of great importance, the reporter visited various supervisory committee members to inquire about their opinions. A certain committee member, elected by the committee members, issued the following statement to the reporter: There are three main points in Mr. Wang's speech. First, although the five powers are separated, there is still a system. The Central Political Council naturally has the power to guide and supervise the five yuan, but according to the regulations of the Political Council, the Political Council does not directly handle government affairs and issue orders, but is a communication and liaison mechanism between the party and the government. It has the power to guide and supervise the five yuan, but does not directly interfere with the independent exercise of their powers. Moreover, the impeachment case of the Supervisory Yuan has been reviewed and passed, and the disciplinary organ has decided on punishment, and the Political Council must still review it. Then, why is it that a case that has been prosecuted by the court and has been finally judged does not need to be reviewed by the Political Council? It is truly incomprehensible to say that this does not hinder the independence of the five powers. Second, releasing the impeachment case before the disciplinary organ has decided on it greatly damages the reputation of the impeached person. It is not known that the impeachment case of this Yuan is not like the hearsay of the censors of the former Qing Dynasty. According to the current impeachment law, there must be evidence and facts, and it must be proposed by one or more people, and reviewed and passed by three or five people before it can be sent out and released (not every case is released, only those deemed necessary are released). Moreover, this Yuan has been criticized by the outside world for several years for only impeaching minor officials and not daring to impeach major officials. In fact, slightly larger cases have mostly been shelved. The only thing that can seek the society's understanding of the power of supervision is this power to release impeachment cases. Now that even this is deprived, it would be better to directly abolish the Supervisory Yuan. Mr. Wang considers the impeached civil servants, which is certainly thoughtful, but does he not consider the defrauded small people and the entire clear political system? Third, the Executive Yuan is responsible to the Central Executive Committee, not to other organs. Therefore, the Political Council can review the punishment of political officials. It is not known that those responsible to the Central Committee are responsible for political responsibility. In other words, they are responsible for the right or wrong of policy. The officials impeached by the Supervisory Yuan are those who have violated the law and neglected their duties, and at this time, there is no right to offer suggestions on policy. If political officials' violations of the law, neglect of duty, pursuit of private interests, and even loss of national interests, can all be explained away, there is probably no such reason or law in ancient and modern times, at home and abroad. Moreover, if what Mr. Wang said is true, it seems that even if the political officials of the Executive Yuan violate the law and neglect their duties, they are only responsible to the Central Political Council. Then why have the Judicial Yuan? Why have the Supervisory Yuan? Moreover, most of the current members of the Political Council also serve as political officials. If the punishment of political officials must be reviewed by the Political Council, is it not the same as allowing the impeached person to decide on their own punishment, or even allowing the impeached person to declare themselves not subject to punishment? Is it not ridiculous? For example, Gu Mengyu, the Minister of Railways impeached by this Yuan, is also a member of the Central Political Council. In short, the colleagues are unwilling to discuss the supplementary impeachment case methods of this Central Political Council, except to submit them to the higher-level organs according to law. However, regarding the personal remarks made by Mr. Wang, the colleagues must make a statement in order to maintain the legacy of the Prime Minister and the spirit of independence of the power of supervision.

<h3>Military Education and the Militia System</h3>
<p>— Respectfully</p>
<p>Since the First World War, the movement for military-national education was once submerged by the waves of peace. However, today, all countries are competing to increase military strength for a second major slaughter. We, surrounded by powerful nations and facing the loss of territory and national humiliation, cannot stand idly by and hope to escape the disasters of war by some fluke. Recently, the central military and education authorities have been urging high schools and above to implement summer military training. It is said that the purpose is to cultivate a disciplined and serious group life among students and to correct the bad habits of romanticism and licentiousness. This is indeed a crucial plan. Compared to Europeans and Americans, the morality, intelligence, and talent of our people are not necessarily inferior. However, once we form a group, we often fall far behind. The Japanese mock us as an incomplete modern nation, and the reason lies in our unfamiliarity with group activities. We should reflect on ourselves and feel ashamed. Military training is a good way to cultivate a disciplined group life. If implemented properly, it can naturally change the temperament of young people and greatly benefit the future of the nation. Unfortunately, summer military training is too short. It may give some young people an impression of military life in form, but it does not have the effect of changing customs and habits. Moreover, the curriculum and teaching materials are too biased towards rigid indoctrination and lack spiritual enlightenment. As for the general society outside the student class, it is as if they are in another world and do not know what military training is. This is similar to the drawback of limiting educational extension to a small number of schools. The reason for this is that our country implements a conscription system, and the gap between the military and the people is clearly defined. However, under the conscription system, the term of service in our army is not limited, so it should be technically proficient and well-disciplined. But this is not the case. The general backwardness of the national economy and the difficulty of military supplies mean that the soldiers are worried about clothing and food and have no time to cultivate morality or enrich knowledge. The general trend is that the people do not respect soldiers, and soldiers are unwilling to cooperate with the people. The worst ones openly prey on the people, creating China's unique military disasters. Therefore, without reforming the conscription system, even students who enjoy short-term military training will not be able to influence the general public's attitude towards soldiers. The question should be considered: The lack of group life cultivation among our people is related to the conscription system. If we want to remedy it, we must implement a conscription system. Don't we see that the powerful countries of the world, such as Germany, Japan, and the Soviet Union, are all conscription countries? Therefore, their promotion of military-national education can live up to its name. The educational spirit is manifested in peacetime as orderliness and emphasis on public morality, and in wartime as obedience and discipline. China is a vast country with a large population, which is prone to disorganization. For thousands of years, it has not undergone this kind of strict training, so when facing a major enemy, it still cannot pool its resources and efforts to resist with all its strength. Learning from the past, can we not be inspired? Someone may say that Britain and the United States have not only not implemented a conscription system, but also have not advocated military-national education. However, their national strength is strong, and their people are generally familiar with group life. Why is this? The answer is that the Anglo-Saxon people have long been immersed in democracy and nurtured by school education, so they can understand the relationship between the country and the people and their own responsibilities without the need for military-national education. This is not something that other nations can compare to. The advantages of the conscription system are particularly suitable for China's national conditions. First, it can be used to train the people and unify military power and military orders. No place can raise private soldiers to be the pawns of a few people. Second, the soldiers are replaced regularly. After the term of service expires, they return to the reserve. After a few years, the whole country can be soldiers, and there will be no distinction between military and civilians. Once the country is in trouble, the mobilization order is issued, and they can be gathered anywhere to jointly face the national crisis, so as not to repeat the mistakes of the past. However, judging from the current situation, future wars cannot be won purely by military strength. Modern countries are using the latest scientific knowledge, the most complete organizational skills, and the highest limit of natural resources to engage in war. Our country's scientific skills and industry are already backward, and the people lack appropriate organization and training. Even if we learn the superficial aspects of the conscription system, it will not be enough to win. Furthermore, we guess that the central government intends to gradually promote the conscription system throughout the country with school military training as the center. If so, we are afraid that this road will be slow and difficult to achieve results. We admit that military training, if implemented properly, can indeed give school youth good training and indirectly benefit the country. However, in order to prepare for the conscription system, we should open up new paths, at least to strengthen the existing civilian forces such as merchant groups and village groups with strict training and active promotion. Otherwise, if we allow the peasants, who account for more than 80% of the national population, to be unarmed and unable to defend themselves, and only place heavy hopes on a very small number of young students, it is not a fundamental solution.</p>

<h3>Twelve U.S. Navy Planes Practice Formation Flying to Arrive at Dutch Harbor, Alaska, Over 7,000 Miles Away; Army Planes Scheduled to Depart Today</h3>
<p>From San Diego, twelve U.S. Navy planes, divided into two groups, departed at 10:47 this morning for a coastal flight of 7,700 miles. They will fly to Dutch Harbor, Alaska, and then return. The entire team consists of sixty-one officers. San Francisco is their first stop, and they will need to land nine times along the way to refuel. The longest leg is 700 miles. (National Electric, 17th)</p>
<p>Washington – This morning, Navy planes departed from San Diego, bound for Alaska, marking a new high point in the competition between Army and Navy aviation. The Army, having faced criticism from the public last year for its handling of airmail delivery, is also scheduled to send a formation of ten Martin-type heavy bombers to Alaska at 10:00 AM this Thursday. The Army planes were originally scheduled to depart earlier this month, but the departure was temporarily postponed due to concerns that the strike in San Francisco would make refueling along the way difficult. The War Department formally announced the confirmed departure date this morning. The purpose of this flight is threefold: (1) to demonstrate the formation flying capabilities of Army aviators; (2) to promote friendship between the United States and Canada; (3) to test the merits of Martin bombers.

<h3>Saito Reports to Hirota: The United States' Attitude Toward Japan Shows No Problems That Cannot Be Resolved Diplomatically</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) After arriving in Tokyo at 4:00 PM on the 17th, Ambassador Saito immediately visited Foreign Minister Hirota to report on the political situation in the United States and the details of his discussions with President Roosevelt, Secretary Hull, and other key figures. They exchanged views on the issue of the naval disarmament conference. He left at 5:40 PM. Ambassador Saito plans to visit Naval Minister Osumi, Army Minister Hayashi, and others starting on the 18th to express his diplomatic opinions. (Nichi-Ren Electric, 18th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The contents of Ambassador Saito's report to Foreign Minister Hirota yesterday were as follows: The U.S. government has not yet made concrete preparations for the next disarmament conference. However, it does not show tolerance for Japan's desire for unconditional recognition of equal armament rights. It intends to conclude a new treaty under the extension of the current treaty. If Hirota and Hull exchange documents, there will be no problems between the two governments that cannot be resolved through diplomatic negotiations. In the future, if problems arise, they can be negotiated in a spirit of friendship. The U.S. government also intends to adjust Japan-U.S. relations based on the Hirota-Hull exchange of documents, believing that it is not necessary to conclude new treaties such as a non-aggression pact. The attitude of the American people towards the Manchuria problem has changed greatly recently. The reason seems to be the result of the sound development of "Manchukuo." Many influential people in the United States believe that the Manchuria problem has been resolved. Recently, there has been a surge in calls for Japan and the United States to conclude a reciprocal trade agreement. However, Japan-U.S. trade is currently in an ideal state of balance, so there is no need to adopt a reciprocal system. (Nichi-Ren Electric, 18th)</p>
<h3>Konoe Leaves the United States to Return to Japan</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a report from the Tokyo Newspaper, Duke Fumimaro Konoe, Speaker of the Japanese House of Peers, arrived in San Francisco yesterday morning. To avoid the strike riots, he boarded the Japanese ship "Hotada Maru" in the afternoon. The ship is scheduled to set sail for Yokohama today. Konoe is being considered for the position of Minister of Colonial Affairs. His early return to Japan is attracting attention from all sectors. However, the military still insists on abolishing the Ministry of Colonial Affairs or on having a military officer selected by the military appointed as Minister of Colonial Affairs. The trend is worth noting. (Hualian Electric, 18th)</p>
<h3>Speculation on Germany's Attitude Toward the Eastern European Pact</h3>
<p>(London) British Ambassador to Germany Sir Eric Phipps informed the German government last Friday of Britain's support for the regional mutual assistance pact. According to sources from Berlin, the German government is unlikely to reject Britain's expression. However, Germany will use the implementation of the principle of equal armament as an exchange condition for supporting the pact plan. Therefore, Germany's reply will inevitably raise some clear questions on the implementation of the principle of equal armament and request Britain to answer them. The first question is whether Germany can enjoy equal armament before participating in the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact. The second question is to what extent the implementation of the principle of equal armament can allow Germany to rearm. If Germany does raise these questions, then we can say that Germany's attitude towards the regional mutual assistance pact is the same as its attitude towards the disarmament conference in the past. Because when various disarmament plans were proposed in Geneva in the past, Germany also asked "Whether disarmament equality should be fully guaranteed and realized first, or only after security guarantees are established, and as its price." In short, regardless of the past disarmament plans or the current regional mutual assistance pact, what Germany is arguing for is the order of implementation of the principle of equal armament. Regarding this level, the attitude of people here is quite reserved, but it is generally believed that if Berlin insists on raising this issue, then this side will not easily give in. However, the situation may be different if Germany can earnestly guarantee to immediately return to the League of Nations. As for the Polish side, since the British Ambassador in Warsaw notified the British opinion last Friday, there has been no response. Generally, people are also quite worried. According to the initial news received here, it seems that the Polish government may not be able to directly and readily support the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact plan.

<h3>Vargas Elected President of Brazil: An Outstanding South American Political Talent Who Takes It Upon Himself to Restore Constitutional Government</h3>
<p>⊙Rio de Janeiro, Brazil - Interim President Vargas, who has been in power for four years, was elected as the formal president today. The Brazilian Constitutional Assembly recently passed the Constitution to restore constitutional normality. The election of the president today is the second step in this work. Vargas' election was long expected. Vargas was recommended by most of the prominent figures in Brazil and has been deeply loved by the people for four years. There have been some voices of opposition, but there has been no organized movement. Vargas led the revolution in 1930, overthrowing the conservative government. In November of that year, the revolutionary army occupied the capital of Rio de Janeiro, and Vargas became the interim president. After taking office, he promised to complete the constitutional government. In May of last year, Vargas ordered the election of the Constitutional Assembly. After the establishment of the assembly, the constitution was formulated within six months. Now, the Constitutional Assembly will re-discuss various supplementary laws and then dissolve. The president has been elected today, and the parliament will be formally elected soon. Vargas is one of the most capable politicians in South America. Except for the internal war in Sao Paulo in 1932, there has been little political turmoil during his tenure as interim president. (National Electric, 17th)</p>
<h3>British Officer Shot: Britain and Turkey Will Jointly Investigate the Truth; Turkey Explains That There Was No Violation of the Law; Several British Warships Set Sail to Demonstrate</h3>
<p>⊙Samos - According to the latest report, twelve British warships have arrived in Digani Port because a British naval officer was shot by Turkish soldiers. The body of the naval medical officer, Robinson, has not yet been found. All the sailors of the warship "London" are still allowed to continue searching by the Turkish authorities. The British Ambassador to Turkey has been ordered by the British government to propose a joint investigation into the matter to the Turkish government. The Minister of Military and Political Affairs of Turkey has also personally gone to the scene of the incident to investigate the truth. It is rumored that British officials regard this matter as serious, and the situation reported by Britain and Turkey is very different. (National News Agency Electric, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) - Today, Turkish Ambassador Fethi Bey visited the British Foreign Office regarding the incident in which Turkish soldiers shot and killed officers of the British cruiser "Tyne Hill" near Samos Island, and expressed regret on behalf of the Turkish government. The Turkish Ambassador also explained that the soldiers who fired the shots belonged to the Coast Guard. However, they were not guilty because the officers who were shot were not wearing uniforms, but swimming trunks, and did not obey when the soldiers ordered them to stop, causing the soldiers to suspect them of being smugglers and shoot at them. According to reports from Athens, the British cruiser "London" and seven other destroyers have sailed to Samos Island, ostensibly as a general exercise. At the same time, the British aircraft carrier "Furious" also entered the port of Athens accompanied by another destroyer. (National Electric, 18th)</p>
<p>⊙Istanbul - A team of British destroyers and a seaplane are searching this morning for the body of Lieutenant Robinson, an officer from the British cruiser "Taumata," who was shot and fell into the sea, but has not yet been found. Previously, the captain of the "Taumata" and the British Vice-Consul had requested permission from the Turkish authorities. Twelve British warships are now docked in Tigani Port on Samos Island. Admiral Fisher, Commander-in-Chief of the British Mediterranean Fleet, was traveling in Cyprus. After the incident, he shortened his itinerary and arrived here today on the "Queen Elizabeth" earlier than scheduled. At the same time, British Ambassador to Turkey Sir Loraine has arrived in Ankara, and Turkish Defense Minister Zekai has set off for Smyrna. It is now believed that Zekai's trip is due to the incident where American Professor Borden and his wife were robbed by Turkish soldiers, and then a British officer was shot and killed by soldiers. The Borden couple were traveling in a small boat in the Sea of Marmara and set up camp near a gunpowder factory outside of Istanbul. That night, several soldiers pulled the tent and robbed Borden's luggage. Later, the American Consul reported to the Turkish authorities, and the perpetrators were all arrested, and the stolen goods were also recovered. (Reuters Electric, 18th)</p>
<h3>Debt Negotiations: France and Germany Reach Agreement; Refuse to Return the Surplus of Collateral; Disagreement Between the German Government and Custodians</h3>
<p>(Paris) - The French and German delegations, which have been negotiating in Berlin for three weeks, have reached an agreement in principle. Its contents are: (1) Amendments to the method of paying principal and interest on Dawes and Young bonds; (2) Germany grants commercial interests to France. The sorting out of the above agreement is being continued by both Paris and Berlin. (Havas News Agency Electric, 17th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) - The Dawes and Young bonds have always been secured by tobacco, beer, and alcohol taxes. The monthly tax revenue is as high as 200 million marks, which is collected by the German National Bank on behalf of the trust company organized by the bondholders. After deducting the principal and interest of the two bonds, the surplus is allocated to the German government. Now, the trust company claims that the German government has used the excuse of lacking foreign currency to be unable to pay the principal and interest due on July 15 of the two bonds, and yesterday notified the National Central Bank that the collateral income, the balance of 4.3 million marks, should not be allocated to the German government, and the two tasks of entrusting the bank to pay the principal and interest for a long time and allocating the surplus to the German government were cancelled. The German News Agency published a criticism, saying that the trust company's move was nothing more than making trouble out of nothing and intending to put pressure on the German government. The German government has also taken the necessary measures to restore the normal use of the above collateral income. (Note: The original contract for the issuance of Dawes and Young bonds stipulates that this collateral income is specifically used to secure the two bonds.) (Havas News Agency Electric, 17th)</p>

Farmers in villages and towns are extremely panicked. They are very superstitious and believe that the flood era in the Bible has returned. Relief work has begun, but it is very difficult due to blocked transportation. Interior Minister Pieracki heard the news while on vacation and immediately rushed back. The actual situation of the disaster cannot be known in detail within a few days due to the inability of communication in rural areas. The government has now ordered the army to assist in the relief, sending three brigades of infantry and engineers and five brigades of cavalry to each area. (National News Agency Electric, 17th)</p>

<h3>San Francisco: Labor Strife Shows Signs of Resolution; Strike Committee Refers to Arbitration; Maritime Union Expresses Opposition</h3>
<p>⊙ The general strike situation in San Francisco has indeed taken a turn for the better today. Peaceful negotiations are expected to begin soon. Labor leaders met this afternoon for a considerable time and drafted a resolution regarding arbitration. According to a member of the Central Labor Dispute Mediation Committee, concrete proposals to end the entire dispute are currently under consideration. (Reuters, 17th) ⊙ The San Francisco Strike Committee has now requested arbitration to resolve the labor strife. (Reuters, 18th) ⊙ The general strike situation in San Francisco has eased, and there is talk of an early peaceful resolution. Director of the National Recovery Administration Johnson met this evening with Undersecretary of Labor McGrady and key figures from San Francisco's business community, who are also members of the General Mediation Committee, but no statement was issued. After the Strike Committee made some concessions yesterday, streetcars are now running, food stores are gradually reopening, and food trucks are able to travel without obstruction. (National News Agency, 18th)</p>
<p>⊙ After the outbreak of the general strike in San Francisco, the situation has improved today. The arbitration committee appointed by the President has proposed that all disputes be submitted to arbitration. The Strike Steering Committee immediately convened, and Chairman Rori immediately submitted the proposal to resolve the dispute to the committee, stating, "The Strike Committee has now taken the final step. Now it only depends on the employers expressing their views. If the employers can also express the same willingness to cooperate with the labor unions, then all business in San Francisco can immediately return to normal." It is reported that the Strike Steering Committee today passed a resolution to "advise" strikers to accept arbitration to resolve the dispute by a vote of 207 to 108. The resolution stated that the protracted general strike would greatly endanger the economic future of the Pacific coast and requested the governors of California, Oregon, and Washington, and the mayors of cities affected by the labor strife, to appeal to President Roosevelt, so that both labor and management could submit all current disputes to arbitration, provided that the acceptance of arbitration is conditional on the employer recognizing the union with which the dispute has arisen. The intention of the Strike Steering Committee is to force the employers to allow each of the ten striking unions to send one representative to join the mediation committee. As for the communist organizations, many of whose members have been imprisoned, the authorities are still strictly suppressing them. (Havas, 17th) ⊙ A member of the arbitration committee appointed by President Roosevelt in San Francisco, whose chairman is Bishop Hannah of San Francisco, announced today that if the workers are willing to immediately return to work, the employers are willing to submit all issues that led to the San Francisco strike to arbitration. Upon hearing the news, the San Francisco General Strike Committee immediately convened a meeting to discuss this proposal. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<h3>Longshoremen Oppose Arbitration Resolution; Fear of Split Between Left and Right Wings; Key Lies in Employers' Attitude</h3>
<p>⊙ The left-wing leaders of the striking longshoremen in San Francisco are now vehemently opposed to the arbitration resolution passed by the Strike Committee. The longshoremen are firmly opposed to arbitrating their demand for recognition of the union as the employment manager and stated that no matter what the General Strike Committee does, it cannot cancel the strike, but can only propose to cancel it. Secretary-General of the General Strike Committee Shen Dewei, one of the moderate leaders, is now said to have stated that the vote was completely orderly and that special precautions were taken at the time to prevent anyone from manipulating the vote. The current key lies in the decision of the longshoremen's employers, who are scheduled to meet today to decide on their attitude towards arbitration. (Reuters, 18th) ⊙ The shipping companies and the Seafarers' Union have unanimously expressed their refusal to mediate. Therefore, the hope for an early resolution of the shipping strike has diminished. Observers tonight believe that the Strike Committee's move to submit all labor-management disputes to arbitration is meaningless, but may lead to a split between the left and right wings of the union. Refusal to arbitrate will cause dissatisfaction among other unions and cause them to return to work. Conservative labor leaders have informally declared that if the Seafarers' Union refuses to mediate, the steps taken by the Strike Committee will end the general strike. Cox, the secretary of the San Francisco branch of the International Longshoremen's Association, expressed the longshoremen's attitude, saying that the committee's decision to immediately submit the dispute to mediation goes against our wishes and that we will reject it when it is submitted to us for a vote. The shipping companies' unwillingness to accept the arbitration proposal was first announced by Lai Fa, who is currently the general manager of the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company and a powerful figure on the employer's side. Director of the National Recovery Administration General Johnson gave a speech in Berkeley tonight, completely placing the responsibility for the shipping strike on the shipping companies. Therefore, the shipping companies' resolute attitude is also remarkable. General Johnson declared that employers' denial of workers' right to elect representatives to conduct collective bargaining should bear all responsibility for this matter. The Strike Committee meeting was heated, and the committee voted to directly petition the President to instruct labor and management to organize a workers' mediation committee. The Strike Committee also issued a declaration advising seafarers and employees to immediately submit to unconditional arbitration and accept the arbitrator's judgment.

<h3>Johnson Mediates Tirelessly Through the Night; Contacts Labor and Management Separately; Public Food Panic Eases</h3>
<p>⊙ Director of the National Recovery Administration General Johnson in San Francisco has been working to resolve the labor strife, contacting representatives from both labor and management separately, tirelessly through the night. The public food situation today is somewhat eased. Fresh vegetables are now available for sale. After the truck drivers in Minneapolis went on strike, the authorities have dispatched troops as police reinforcements. Twenty-one textile mills in Alabama are now closed, with 13,500 workers unemployed. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>The Strike Situation the Day Before Yesterday: The strike situation in various places in San Francisco today is as follows: 100,000 union members in San Francisco are on strike; 1,500 longshoremen and seafarers in Portland have gone on strike, and others are said to be following suit; 7,000 truck drivers in Minneapolis are on strike, and several teams of the National Guard have been ordered to be on standby; 2,400 longshoremen in Seattle; 10,000 textile workers in Huntsville, Alabama, are on strike.</p>
<p>Walking with Bread: Due to the unavailability of fresh food in San Francisco, people relied on canned food for breakfast this morning. The city's general merchants carried bread with them to their offices and placed canned food in bags. Before long, the situation improved because the Strike Committee allowed workers to maintain certain necessary jobs. Several restaurants immediately reopened, and food was continuously transported in from outside.</p>
<p>Armed Alert Along the River: The National Guard is still stationed in various places to prevent incidents. The entire five and a half miles along the river is now under military control. Groups organized by citizens and merchants today requested martial law. The Governor of California replied that if the National Guard could not cope with the situation, he would take any necessary measures. The governor's words meant that if necessary, he would seek help from the central troops.</p>
<p>Hoarding and Robbery in Stores: This afternoon, twenty stores in Oakland were robbed, which was caused by hoarding. There were also trucks overturned and drivers beaten. As a result, many small stores that had not closed immediately shut down. Pearl merchants, on the advice of the authorities, placed all their treasures in iron boxes and ceased business today. It is feared that this labor strife will affect New York. According to news this morning, wireless operators on all ships sailing from Pacific ports will strike when the ships arrive in New York. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Appealing to the President for Intervention: Washington D.C., White House news today: Several telegrams from groups such as the Chamber of Commerce requesting the President to intervene in the San Francisco labor strife have been forwarded to President Roosevelt. As for whether the President will shorten his vacation and return home to handle this matter, there has been no indication yet.</p>
<p>Johnson's Angry Words: While receiving an honorary degree from the University of California today, Director of the National Recovery Administration General Johnson of San Francisco gave a speech to the students, denouncing the general strike in San Francisco as civil strife and a bloody rebellion, saying that dissatisfied workers certainly have the right to strike against employers, which cannot be denied. However, the current general strike is an act of threatening the public. Not only is interstate and international commerce along the coast brought to a standstill, but the credibility of the central government is also damaged. Agitators who are hostile to business are using economic murder, which is no different from shooting innocent passersby in the street with guns. If the responsible members of organized labor unions do not immediately clarify this, it will set back the American labor movement by ten years. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Communists Seize the Opportunity to Incite Trouble: Several insignificant riots broke out in Oakland, San Francisco, tonight. After hearing reports that rioters were planning to destroy stores and threaten clerks, the authorities dispatched machine gun teams to the scene of the incident along the river. A "Vigilance Corps" organized by citizens has repeatedly attacked communist organizations. The police have arrested 340 people suspected of inciting trouble and confiscated a large number of revolutionary publications. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The increasing expansion of the strike turmoil in San Francisco, USA, has shocked the world, but Soviet Russian commentary is quite comforting. For example, the Soviet Russian government agency Pravda published an article today with a very clear theme. Since the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia, Soviet Russian commentary has remained silent on all matters related to the internal affairs of the United States. This policy has been adhered to for a long time. Now, unexpectedly, amidst the endless stream of strike riots and other turmoil, it suddenly changed its silent attitude and praised the various social changes in the United States through its central agency and implied that this kind of labor turmoil and unrest will not stop until the final goal is achieved, and at the same time, it encouraged the American communists. (National News Agency, 17th) Vigilance Corps Represses Communists: The "Vigilance Corps" organized by citizens in San Francisco beat communists, using baseball bats as one of their weapons. These people drove quickly to various places, disrupted the communists' organizations while they were unprepared. The police tracked them down, intending to stop their destructive behavior, but often failed. The members of the "Vigilance Corps" used sticks to smash windows and furniture. The communists were unable to resist and fled. The Workers' Daily newspaper office, a communist organization, was destroyed by the crowd today, and most of the equipment in the office was looted. (Reuters, 18th) Sailors Respond Remotely: The ocean liner "Hayes" of the Japanese Dai Lai Company arrived here today. When it arrived in La Paul, the sailors on the ship demonstrated on deck, expressing their sympathy for the general strike in San Francisco. Because the sailors could not restore order, they invited Italian police to board the ship. Three ringleaders were then arrested by the Fascist militia. One sailor was seriously injured and has been sent to the hospital. (Reuters, 18th) Japanese Maritime Transport Affected: (Tokyo) The general strike of workers in San Francisco, USA, is affecting the Japanese shipping industry. The Osaka Merchant Ship, Kawasaki, International, Mitsui, and Daido companies are unable to unload goods in the United States, so the amount of goods shipped from Japan to the United States has been reduced by half. Charter fees have been reduced by five jiao per ton to two yuan and five jiao. If the strike extends to the east coast of the United States, the export of Japanese raw silk will be more greatly affected. (Japan United News Agency, 18th)</p>

<h3>Economic Commission Controls Water Conservancy Administration</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to information from the Economic Commission, the central government has been planning to control water conservancy administration in our country for some time. Recently, the Central Political Conference decided to hand over the national water conservancy administrative undertakings to this committee for unified management and discussed and formulated an outline for unified water conservancy administration and business measures, and unified water conservancy administration business implementation measures. This outline and measures have now been issued to the meeting by the National Government and will be carried out in accordance with the original issued implementation measures. This committee is the national water conservancy general agency and is responsible for presiding over by the five standing committee members of this committee. The outside world rumored that the Water Conservancy Department of this committee or the organization of a Water Conservancy Committee would be the general agency, which is not the case. However, in the future, in order to pool wisdom and ideas in the implementation of unification, or to submit various unification issues to the Water Conservancy Committee to first draft a plan, so that the meeting can review and approve it and report it to the Central Committee for approval and implementation, is also unknown. The Water Conservancy Committee will be organized by this committee employing current relevant unified water conservancy personnel as committee members in accordance with the Provisional Organizational Regulations of the Water Conservancy Committee. The selection of committee members is being carefully considered by each standing committee member of this committee and has not yet been decided. According to the central government's regulations, the water conservancy administration of each province is under the jurisdiction of the Construction Department, and the water conservancy administration of each county is under the jurisdiction of the county government, subject to the command and supervision of the central water conservancy general agency. Water conservancy involving more than two provinces is managed by the central water conservancy general agency in a unified manner, and water conservancy involving more than two counties is managed by the Construction Department in a unified manner. Regarding funding, 1. The funding for each water conservancy agency originally borne by the national treasury will be transferred and distributed by this committee in a unified manner according to the total amount listed in the budget. 2. Starting from the 23rd year, the central budget will annually include 6 million yuan for central water conservancy undertakings, funded by the Ministry of Finance. The water conservancy self-employment funds for provinces and counties should be raised by the provinces and counties themselves. The original repair and prevention fees, etc., for each province will still be borne by the provinces as before. Regarding the principles for future progress, it is necessary to conduct a detailed study at the meeting of the Standing Committee before a decision can be made. (Special Dispatch, 18th) (Nanjing) The Economic Commission's Water Conservancy Committee will be established soon. The chairman of the committee is internally designated to be a certain central committee member, and the other committee members are all internally designated, mostly water conservancy experts.

<h3>Korean Residents in Northeast China Exceed One Million Forced by the Puppet State to Lease Paddy Fields, All Controlled by the Japanese The Situation Becomes a Case of the Guest Supplanting the Host The Lives of Compatriots in Northeast China are in Peril</h3>
<p>A special dispatch from Shenyang: Since the outbreak of the September 18th Incident, Japan has been striving to transfer Korean farmers to Northeast China. As a result, the number of Korean residents in Northeast China has been increasing year by year. Recently, Japan used threatening tactics to revise the so-called commercial lease rights with the puppet government. This spring, the original water conservancy bureau in Northeast China was abolished. In addition, it forced various counties to allow Koreans to lease paddy fields anytime and anywhere. Therefore, since this spring, the number of Koreans crossing the Yalu River into Northeast China has suddenly increased threefold compared to before. Up to now, the number of Koreans residing in Northeast China has exceeded one million. According to a survey conducted by the Japanese East Asia Development Company at the end of last year on the amount of paddy fields occupied by Koreans in Northeast China and the population:</p>
<p>Province Paddy Fields Rice Harvest Households Population Liaoning 35,268 cho 931,528 koku 27,207 households 142,311 people Jilin 32,743 cho 885,180 koku 104,224 households 580,476 people Heilongjiang 2,350 cho 65,958 koku 1,095 households 4,652 people Total 70,362 cho 1,882,766 koku 132,526 households 727,439 people According to the above table, it is known that by the end of last year, the number of Koreans in Northeast China had increased to more than 700,000. Combined with the sharp increase this year, it has now exceeded one million. Judging from the current situation of the sharp increase in the number of Koreans in Northeast China, there is a danger of the guest supplanting the host within a few years. The future life crisis of our compatriots in Northeast China is almost unimaginable. The following is a table based on Japanese statistics from Showa 1 to Showa 8 (1926 to 1933) regarding the increase in paddy fields and population of Koreans in Northeast China.</p>

<p>Since this year, after Japan and the puppet organization forcibly concluded the so-called commercial lease rights and abolished the original water conservancy bureau, the number of Koreans coming to Northeast China has been increasing daily. Therefore, the Japanese are paying attention to the control of Koreans and the so-called security issues. As a result, for Koreans in Northeast China, so-called safety villages were established to govern them by residency, stabilize the lives of Korean people, and actively conduct military training to prepare them to participate in actual combat when a war with Russia breaks out.

<h3>Hubei Province Strictly Prevents Flood Damage The Provincial Government Divides Responsibility for Dike Protection and Flood Prevention The Department of Civil Affairs and Construction Organizes a Drought Relief Committee to Assist Rural Areas</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: This year, Hubei Province has experienced both floods and droughts. As of now, the disaster area covers about 40 counties, accounting for more than two-thirds of the province's total area. Although the water level of the Yangtze and Xiang Rivers is temporarily stable, it is still rising. Once the summer flood arrives, the crisis remains. There was some rainfall in Wuhan yesterday, and the citizens were overjoyed. However, it is not yet known whether the counties have received the same rainfall, and the amount is minimal, which is of little help to agriculture. However, it slightly reduces the intense heat. The provincial government is still paying attention to disaster prevention and relief, and it seems to be considering both floods and droughts. On the 17th, it telegraphed the Jianghan Engineering Bureau and the county heads of the counties with embankments to actively prevent floods and protect the embankments to avoid further breaches, and to divide responsibilities. The Jianghan Engineering Bureau will fully allocate funds in accordance with the flood prevention measures and supervise the work of various engineering offices to investigate and protect them. The county governments will supervise the directors of various repair and prevention offices to inspect day and night, recruit laborers to reinforce and block, and stipulate that the local dike management personnel must absolutely obey the command of the engineering offices and must not violate or delay, which may cause delays. On the other hand, the two departments of Civil Affairs and Construction will jointly set up a drought relief committee, following the example of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, to provide full assistance to the drought-stricken rural areas. Regarding the disaster situation in various counties, in addition to the detailed reports from Jun, Yun, Jing, Tian, Qian, Mian, Jian, Shi, Pu, Chong, Tong, and Xian, the county heads of Huang'an, Huangmei, Guangji, etc. also urgently telegraphed the provincial government yesterday to report the disaster. The content of each telegram is roughly as follows: (1) Cheng Ruhua, Commissioner of the Fourth District and concurrently County Head of Huang'an, telegraphed that there has been no rain in the vicinity of the county seat for 20 days, and in the fourth district, which is further away from the county seat, there has been no rain for 40 days. The fields are dry, the seedlings are withered, and the weather has been hot in recent days, with no sign of rain. After the robbery, the people have suffered another famine year, and the future food situation is extremely worrying. (2) Zhang Yiliu, County Head of Huangmei, telegraphed that the upper townships of the county are mountainous, and the lower townships are near the water. Since mid-June, there has been little rain, especially recently. There has been no rain for more than a month. The crops in the fields are either about to sprout or have yellow tips. The farmers are worried and working hard to dig ditches and divert water, day and night. The people of Jinlin, Zhanghu, Shannan, Lutu, Shangdian, Dushan, Shicun and other towns are extremely terrified and have been welcoming gods and praying for rain for days. The county government has also issued notices prohibiting slaughter and inviting high monks to chant scriptures to pray for abundant rain. As for the Jiangdi, Shangwu, and Xiaqikou dike sections, which are all within the county, the flood season has arrived, and the water is rising daily. The repair and prevention directors have been strictly ordered to be on the dike day and night, together with the engineers of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, to protect them properly and ensure safety. (3) Fu Changmin, County Head of Guangji, telegraphed that the county has been plagued by floods and bandits for years. Since the beginning of this year, there has been continuous cloudy and rainy weather. In April, there was a heavy rain, and mountain floods broke out, causing a major disaster. The spring harvest of wheat, hemp, rapeseed, soybeans, rice, and seedlings was almost completely lost. After persuading the people to dredge the accumulated water and replant rice, it was hoped that there would be a harvest in the autumn. But in May and June, there was very little rain and the weather was extremely dry. The once vast land has now become cracked. The green seedlings are all withered. The people pawned their clothes to get seeds, which have now been turned into nothing, no different from taking their lives. They are running around crying, and the whole county is in a frenzy. The tax collectors are going to the countryside, and several people are being beaten and injured every day. If the tax collection is not stopped, it is bound to lead to a major change. Please postpone it until the autumn harvest before collecting taxes, so as to leave the people a ray of hope. (17th)</p>
<h3>Development of Haiyan Yong'an Lake in Zhejiang Province Natural Scenery Compares to West Lake Land Prices Soar, Many Buyers</h3>
<p>Ganpu in Haiyan, Zhejiang, is the area for the future major port in the East. Five li west of the city, there is Yong'an Lake, covering about nine square li. On the west side, a mountain protrudes into the lake and connects to the east side through a dam, dividing the lake into north and south. Therefore, it is also called North-South Lake. In the center of the North Lake, there is a lake pier, like a heart, surrounded by mountains on three sides. On the south side, there is a piece of salt field, connected to Hangzhou Bay. With green mountains and blue waters, the scenery is magnificent and grand, surpassing West Lake in Hangzhou.</p>
<p>The county authorities, in view of this, recently passed a proposal to develop the Ganpu Yong'an Lake scenic area at the fifth county administrative meeting and appointed Song Qingping and others as members to organize the scenic area management committee. The committee resolved at its first meeting on the 10th of this month: 1. The area around Yong'an Lake is designated as a scenic area and named Haiyan County Yong'an Lake Scenic Area. 2. For all real estate transactions in the scenic area, 5% will be collected as office and operating expenses for the committee. 3. Song Suping, Cha Kailiang, Wang Zhusun, Zhu Qingyuan, Wu Xiong and others are recommended to survey the scenic area and prepare an overall development plan. On one hand, the initial clearing and surveying will be carried out, and the triangular root point will be completed soon. The surveying personnel will also go to Jiaoli Weir on the 18th to find a residence, and will set off immediately to clear and survey each household, then calculate the acreage, draw and publish the map, and issue land title certificates to determine property rights, which will be the basis for all plans.</p>
<p>Under such management plans, more and more people are coming to Yong'an Lake to explore the scenery. Due to convenient transportation and beautiful scenery, future prosperity can be foreseen. Those with assets want to seize the mountains on the lake shore as their own, so there are more and more transactions. The general residents, due to the collapse of the rural economy in recent years, are mostly unable to make ends meet and are heavily indebted. Naturally, they are unable to manage and do not know the benefits in the future, so they are greedy for the current benefits and sell one after another, receiving ten to dozens of yuan per mu of land. The best is only 300 yuan per mu. Currently, large households such as Kang of Ningliu and Zhu of the Four Lines Savings Bank have purchased about 100 mu each. Capitalists from other places are also coming to purchase, preparing to build houses. (Mao Zhiguo, student of Shenbao Correspondence School of Journalism)</p>
<h3>Anhui He County Security Team Disarmed | Because of Obstructing the Promotion of the New Life Movement |</h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: He County in Anhui Province has organized a group to promote the New Life Movement. The guidance of the public security police is even more serious. However, the security team of the county regarded the police's persuasion to implement the New Life Movement discipline as shameful, and harbored hostility towards it, resulting in incidents of insulting the police. The county chamber of commerce and all sectors of society have held meetings to mediate, but no solution has been reached. The situation is quite serious. The county head also believes that the police force is weak and helpless, so he reported to the Anhui Provincial Security Office. The director, Cai Bingyan, was extremely dissatisfied upon receiving the news. He immediately led a 40-member armed box cannon team and departed from Anqing on a special vessel. He first went to Dangtu, added a company of security team, and proceeded. After arriving in He County and landing, he gathered all two companies of the county security team in the square under the pretext of inspection. He first conducted a roll call. When the drill was about to begin, Cai ordered that because the weather was too hot, the guns could be placed on the drill field, and the people could retreat to the shade of the trees for a rest. At this point, Cai's box cannon team collected all the guns, and ordered the Dangtu security team to surround the officers and soldiers of the disarmed He County security team to give a speech, announcing the immediate disbandment. It is heard that several junior officers were detained. The matter was resolved smoothly. Cai returned to Anqing the next day to reorganize the county security team. Currently, the Dangtu security team is temporarily stationed in He County to take on defense duties. (16th)</p>

<h3>Northwest Inspection Notes by Our Special Correspondent, Geng Ya</h3>
<p>What is feared is Heaven bestowing rain.</p>
<p>June 1st: Depart from Yingpanshui. The cold is like winter. Even wearing a single fur coat is not enough to ward off the chill. Such summer weather is truly a strange phenomenon of northern Long. After traveling thirty li, we pass a ruin. The broken walls and old foundations suggest about seven or eight households, but now there is no sign of life. The wind rises wildly, and flowing sand whips our faces. Twenty li to Qingya Street, there is an ancient temple, enshrining the Three Saints: Lord Guan, the Fire Ancestor, and the Horse King. It was built during the Daoguang reign (Qing Dynasty). It is grand in scale. Inscriptions on steles indicate that the area produced white salt and the marketplace was bustling, but now everything has collapsed and is in ruins. Superintendent Su said, "When we arrived earlier, we saw seven or eight people standing on this hilltop, looking around, as if searching for something. Knowing they were not good people, we fired shots at them, and they fled behind the mountain. Now the guards have not returned from sentry duty. Please hurry with the meal, so we can travel together." Recalling the past few days, we had all traveled ahead of Superintendent Su. Today, we are following behind, which is fortunate. Superintendent Su's party consists of fourteen people, carrying six pistols and four rifles, with ample ammunition. Even a small band of bandits would not be a threat. The county yamen's runner dispatched by Zhongwei and the mules hired on their behalf have reached the border, so they were given travel money and sent back.</p>
<p>After the meal, we continue on. The terrain gradually flattens. After twenty li, we see dozens of earthen mounds, stretching for more than ten li. To the north, there is a long, endless earthen wall. We are told it is part of the Great Wall. North of the wall is a vast desert. South of the wall is lush grass, where hundreds of camels, cattle, and horses graze, all very plump. This is a natural, large pasture. After thirty li, we arrive at Yitiaoshan for the night. Today's journey totaled one hundred and ten li. Yitiaoshan has fifty households and a population of over two hundred. Based on their occupations, farmers account for about one-tenth, salt warehouse laborers for five-tenths, salt pond workers for two-tenths, and small merchants and others for two-tenths. The well water here is sweet and clear, unlike the water at the nearby stations.</p>
<p>Yitiaoshan is a township under the jurisdiction of Jingtai County. Its name is even more well-known than the county seat, precisely because of the salt production. The salt ponds include areas like Cahan Pond and Tianran Pond, all of which are the property of the Mongols. The ponds are five stations away from Yitiaoshan. The Mongols transport the salt by camel, according to an agreement of 30,000 camel loads per year. Each load weighs three to four hundred catties. The rent for each hundred catties is 3 jiao (collected by the Alashan Wangfu), and the transportation fee is 1 yuan and 8 jiao (collected by the camel owners). All of this is borne by the Yitiaoshan branch of the Gansu Salt Affairs Trade and Transportation Bureau. Then, the branch resells the salt at the original price of 2 yuan and 1 jiao, plus the packaging and transportation fee (i.e., "Shihu Donation") of 7 jiao and 5 fen, the tax of 3 yuan, the exchange loss (Foreign countries use the gold pound as the standard. China uses the silver dollar as the standard. China borrows foreign money to operate the salt affairs. When borrowing, gold is expensive; when repaying, gold is cheap, so the number of borrowed silver is viewed as a loss, named "pound loss.") of 3 jiao, and the stamp tax of 1 jiao and 5 fen, for a total of 6 yuan and 3 jiao. This total is used by the bureau as the standard price for selling to salt merchants, who then resell it in Lanzhou, southern Longnan, and southern Shaanxi, totaling about four million catties per year. The tax revenue is over ten thousand yuan (The total salt tax revenue from Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai is 1.3 million yuan, with Gansu accounting for 500,000 yuan, Ningxia for 700,000 yuan, and Qinghai for 100,000 yuan.) Recently, salt has not been delivered for over ten days. This is not unique to Yitiaoshan; the same is true for the Yabulai and Baidunzi branches. According to the Zhongwei Salt Bureau in Ningxia Province, it paid the pond rent and transportation fees with paper money, but the Mongols refused to accept it and stopped transporting salt, focusing solely on Yitiaoshan. The Zhongwei Bureau then forcibly collected a camel tax of 3 yuan per head at the Sanyukou of the Daxi River, a key point on the salt transportation route. The Mongols refused to pay, abandoned the salt, and returned, and have not yet returned. Fortunately, the salt warehouse has a large stockpile of salt, so a salt shortage has not yet occurred. The Gansu Provincial Bureau is now in consultation with the Ningxia Province by telegram to resolve the issue. It is high summer, but the cold has not abated. We visited the salt bureau and telegraph office. Most of the people we met were wearing fur robes, and at night, they needed to burn a kang for warmth. Yesterday, there was light rain and a biting cold wind. Wounded soldiers passed by and stayed overnight, and two animals even froze to death. Looking around outside the village, the green willows are still thriving. It seems to be a temporary climate change, which will not greatly harm the growth of plants.</p>
<p>June 2nd: Depart from Yitiaoshan. We initially see a vast open space of two hundred li in circumference, neither cultivated nor used for grazing, which is regrettable. There are occasional wheat fields, relying on rainfall for planting. Harvests can be expected in two or three years out of ten, so there are no taxes. The groundwater is very abundant. If more wells were dug to irrigate the land, it might be possible to transform the wasteland into fertile fields. Twenty li to Suohamburg, where we take a photo with Superintendent Jing as a souvenir, as tomorrow he will head west to Liangzhou, while I will head south to Gaolan. Several days ago, two British missionaries, dressed in Chinese clothes and speaking Chinese, came here to distribute pamphlets and preach Christianity. The local elementary school students strongly opposed them, adding words to the pamphlets, saying, "(Foreigners, you speak nicely, but we will not be deceived by your tricks again. We believe that the good words of foreigners are not as good as revering the teachings of our Confucius.)" The words are simple but profound and meaningful. Ten li to Xiejia Spring, with about three to five households. The carts travel on a sandy river, where the stones contain minerals, shining brightly. The stone mountains on both sides are eroded by wind and rain, with many holes. Sheep flocks drink from the river. A soldier catches one, pretending to ask the price. The shepherd says, "Sir, please have mercy on us." The soldier angrily says, "I'm giving you money to buy it, not eating it for free. One yuan! Damn it!" He then leads the sheep away. Suddenly seeing us arriving later, he seems worried and then releases it. Thirty-five li to Zhangjia Shop. According to farmers who cultivate opium poppies, "Each mu of land requires a 'clearing the countryside' fee of 2 yuan and 5 jiao per year. Maintenance fees, grain payments, miscellaneous levies, etc., amount to about 6 yuan. When the opium seedlings are good, we can harvest 40 taels. The minimum is 10 taels. On average, each mu can yield 20 taels. After paying the taxes, the remaining amount is used for our own smoking, to compensate for our hard work, which is only three to five taels." Five li to Dalapai, where Han and Hui people live together, about ten households. There are those who sell tea and noodles, hanging a wooden sign on the corner of the house, with a drawing of a teapot, teacup, and a bundle of noodles, to attract customers. Passing this, black coal is exposed on the mountainside by the road, with occasional mining caves, which are now abandoned. Hair moss, ground-nest vegetables, and similar items can be used as cold dishes and are found everywhere.</p>
<p>Farmers cultivate the mountain valleys, wielding plows and hoes during the day and sleeping in mountain caves at night. They are not locals but come from hundreds of li away, arriving in the spring and returning in the autumn, like migratory birds. The land is called sandy land, covered with pebbles, used to plant opium poppies or buckwheat. No additional fertilizer is applied. Some plant ten mu of opium poppies. According to them, "The initial tax was 60 yuan, but now it has risen to 100 yuan. The annual yield of opium is 500 taels, worth 250 yuan. If we plant wheat, we can harvest four shi, worth only 160 yuan. The tax rate is still the same, so most farmers are willing to abandon wheat and plant opium. Opium grown in sandy soil is called 'sand goods,' which are brittle and have a clear aroma. Opium grown in loam is called 'earth goods,' which are soft and have a rich aroma. Therefore, the value of sand goods is always ten to twenty percent higher than earth goods." Another farmer said, "As long as the crops are good, we are not afraid of crows and sparrows. If Heaven is willing to bestow rain, and the crops are harvested, even if we suffer from war and pay more taxes, we are not afraid. What we fear is that Heaven will not bestow rain." These words show the simplicity and honesty of the Long farmers. After climbing over a small mountain pass, the ground is flat, the grass is lush, and no one cultivates it. It is already dark, and the mountain forest and stone paths are difficult to navigate. We are tired and weary and eager to rest. We push on for thirty li and finally arrive at Shiguaizi, where we knock on a door for lodging. Today's journey totaled one hundred and thirty li. The sand and gravel used for cultivation here must be excavated from wells five to six zhang deep, which is also very arduous. The newly covered sandy land is typically planted with millet in the first year, and then other crops can be grown. Otherwise, nothing will grow.</p>
<p>In the main room of the residents' homes, they often enshrine (Lord Guan) and (The Vinegar Goddess). Enshrining Lord Guan is no different from elsewhere, but the couplet for the Vinegar Goddess reads, "(The sourness remains after four or five hundred years, born on the twenty-first day at the hour of You)." It clearly refers to the words "sour" and "vinegar." It is unclear where this goddess originated. People in Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai also particularly like to eat sour things, such as aged vinegar, sour milk, sour slurry, sour noodles, etc., which are endless. It is commonly said that people's taste preferences can be broadly divided into sweet in the south, salty in the north, spicy in the east, and sour in the west. This seems to be supported by what we see today.</p>
<h3>Two-Year Plan for Guiding the Huai River: Construction of Three Ship Locks at Huai'an, Shaobo, and Liulaojian; Survey Completed and Construction to Begin on the West Embankment of the Grand Canal</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang News: Chen Guofu, Vice Chairman of the Guiding the Huai River Commission, in order to implement the two-year construction plan, has established ship lock engineering bureaus at Shaobo, Huai'an, and Liulaojian (Suqian) successively this year. By the end of last month, the excavation of diversion channels and lock ponds by the Shaobo and Huai'an bureaus has been completed. The Liulaojian bureau was established later and is currently conducting construction surveys. Once the surveys are completed, construction will begin immediately. The commission has advertised for bids for all three ship locks. Once the bids are finalized, materials can be transported and construction can begin. The main purpose of building the ship locks is to maintain a balanced water level in the Grand Canal throughout the year (with a water level of about seven meters), allowing ships carrying 2,000 tons to navigate. Farmland along the canal will also have water for irrigation, benefiting both transportation and irrigation. The ports, sluice gates, and culverts on the west embankment of the Grand Canal must also be closed, have dams built over them, or be repaired to prevent water from flowing into Gaobao Lake when the lake's water level is lower than the canal's. The management of the west embankment of the Grand Canal is handled by the Shaobo Bureau, which was established by the Guiding the Huai River Commission. The bureau originally had an engineering section and a general affairs section. Now, a dyke engineering section has been added, and the head of the engineering section has been renamed the head of the lock engineering section. Wang Fengxi is the engineer for the dyke engineering section, and Wu Yi is the engineer for the lock engineering section. The dyke engineering section organized a survey team for the west embankment of the Grand Canal in early April, which departed on April 7. The team surveyed from Shaobo to Huai'an. The team leader is Deputy Engineer Pan Jiwen, and the surveyors are Huang Si, Chen Han, and Xia Jiahua. There are a total of eleven ports along the west embankment of the Grand Canal: (1) Tieniuwan Port, (2) Zengguan Port, (3) Qiuyu Port, (4) Sanggouzhagang Port, (5) Huangni Port, (6) Cheluo Port, (7) Siwen Port, (8) Chenjia Port, (9) Jiajia Port, (10) Chi'men Port, and (11) Jiusheng Port. There are eight sluice gates: (1) Qing'an Gate, (2) Liu'an Gate, (3) Qili Gate, (4) Shuangkong Gate, (5) Nan Gate, (6) Bei Gate, (7) Tonghu Gate, and (8) Ye Gou Gate. There are eight culverts: (1) Lianghuai Cave, (2) Tuding Cave, (3) Yeyun Cave, (4) Yangzhai Cave, (5) Liuzhai Cave, (6) Yanjia Cave, (7) Liu Cave, and (8) Chengzhai Cave. The team has now completed the survey. The dyke engineering section will design and estimate costs based on the survey records and investigation reports. Construction is expected to begin in the second half of this year. (18th)</p>
<h3>Regulations on Food Regulation and Agricultural Warehouses Promulgated by the Jiangsu Provincial Government</h3>

<h3>Suzhou: Construction Bureau Attends to Drought Relief</h3>
<p>To provide relief for the drought in Wu County, the Construction Bureau has specially dispatched engineer Li Wenhan to Suzhou to handle relief matters. Li arrived in Suzhou yesterday (the 18th) morning and immediately, together with the Wu County Magistrate, took a boat to inspect along the Taihu Lake area in Mudu and Xujiang. Regarding the water diversion problem, it is planned to build a large dam at Xuhong on Taihu Lake, using the largest water pumping machine to pump water from Taihu Lake into the inner lake, to facilitate irrigation of farmland. The Wu County Magistrate quite agrees with this method and it should be implemented. Recently, rain-seeking temple fairs have been heard of daily in Suzhou City.

<h3>Wuxi: Cotton Mills Appeal for Reduction of Consolidated Tax</h3>
<p>The cotton mills in this county, including Shenxin, Zhenxin, Qingfeng, Guangqin, Yukang, Fuxing, Lixin, and others, telegraphed the Nanjing Executive Yuan, the National Economic Council, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, and Chiang Kai-shek's Nanchang Headquarters yesterday (the 18th), requesting a reduction in the consolidated tax. The telegram briefly stated that the cotton industry has been affected by the dumping of Japanese goods and is on the verge of bankruptcy. This has been the case for more than a year, and the decline of the rural economy has had a significant impact. With the sharp reduction in import tariffs, domestic cotton mills are finding it even more difficult to sustain themselves. They earnestly request a reduction in the consolidated tax to remedy the situation, and desperately appeal for consideration.</p>
<h3>Erroneous Report of You Yinzhao's Abduction in Xinjiang</h3>
<p>You Yinzhao, the second son of local gentleman You Tongzhi, is currently an engineer with the Ministry of Railways. On the 10th of this month, the North China Daily News in Beijing reported in a special dispatch that Engineer You and a group of nine people, including the Swedish Sven Hedin, were abducted in Xinjiang. After learning of this news, You's family and friends were extremely worried. Later, a Reuter's dispatch from Central News Agency in Stockholm on the 11th and 12th both stated that the report probably referred to the difficulties encountered previously by Ma Zhongying's troops. Recently, You Yinzhao's brother, Xun Zhao, received a telegram from the First Military Radio Station of the Ministry of Military Affairs in Nanjing, which read: "You Xun Zhao, Nanjing Municipal Bureau of Public Works, your June telegram received, very relieved. Being treated well by Superintendent Cheng in Dihua and receiving assistance with gasoline engine oil parts. Have ordered them from the Soviet Union. The survey team and the cars they brought are still in Lop Nur. Have borrowed engine oil from Superintendent Cheng, which will be sent to the province immediately. Will return as soon as the entire team arrives in Dihua and the oil parts are delivered. Estimated to leave Dihua on the 9th and arrive in Beijing by the end of the year. Homer Berge and Gong Jicheng have both arrived in Dihua, Yin'an. Please forward to Xijin Zhehai Yinhan, etc." It can be seen that the report of You's abduction in the North China Daily News was erroneous.</p>

It is now known that Mr. Gu took the Shanghai-Nanjing train from the capital on the 15th and got off at the Nanxiang station in Jiading. However, he did not stay in Nanxiang and immediately took a car to Shanghai to recuperate. He will return to Jiading within the next few days to worship at the ancestral temple and sweep the graves. The Gu family ancestral temple outside the west gate of the county has been preparing everything, but there has been no activity at his residence on West Avenue. It is likely that he will return to Shanghai on the same day after completing the ancestral worship.</p>
<h3>Jiashan: Epidemic Continues to Spread</h3>

It is said that more than 100,000 bottles have been produced. The distribution in the city is divided into five districts, with dozens of stores and charities entrusted to distribute them by hanging up signs. In the areas where laborers and the poor live, the society sends personnel to distribute them door-to-door. They are also distributed in the four suburban villages, Xiaguan, Pukou, and at the railway station and bus station to provide relief. Recently, they have also received donations of 100 yuan each from Ju Juesheng, President of the Judicial Yuan, and Chen Lifu, Minister of Organization of the Central Party Headquarters. However, due to the enormous demand for medicine, they are currently rushing to produce more medicine while also widely soliciting donations.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin: County Magistrate Visits Province to Request Funding from Construction Bureau for Drought Relief</h3>
<p>Recently, the weather has been severely dry and the drought has become a disaster. Local agencies have established a drought prevention association. In terms of funding, the provincial government has only agreed to allocate 5,000 yuan for county construction expenses. Given the current situation, 50,000 yuan is needed. County Magistrate Bao, together with local gentry Zhu Danqing, Wu Shuying from the Chamber of Commerce, He Ronggui from the Relief Institute, and others, visited the province on the afternoon of the 16th to request more water pumping stations, in accordance with the measures for drought relief in southern Jiangsu. The provincial government's plan for the Lupu Port pumping station is biased towards the western part of the county, benefiting only a small portion of the farmland. Jiangyin has many ports along the river, such as Huangtian Port, Huangshan Port, Ligang, Taohua Port, Shengang, X溝, Xiagang, Shipai Port, Wushan Port, and Zhangjiagang, which are all important waterways in the Yangtze River and benefit the neighboring counties of Wujin, Wuxi, and Changshu. They made a special request to Shen, the Director of the Construction Bureau, to design and construct water pumping stations at the above-mentioned ports as part of the special project for drought relief in southern Jiangsu, and to allocate 50,000 yuan for immediate needs.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Telegram Requesting Funding for Drought Relief</h3>
<p>Nantong is suffering from severe drought. Local communities have decided to use river water to irrigate the fields. In addition to local fundraising, County Magistrate Jin urgently telegraphed the provincial government requesting funding, stating that the drought in the county is extremely severe and the need for water relief is greater than in other parts of southern Jiangsu. It is planned to use 300-horsepower water pumps at Tiansheng and Yaogang ports to draw river water for internal irrigation and complete the work on schedule. In addition to local fundraising, 20,000 yuan is urgently needed. Please allocate drought relief funds for emergency use, awaiting instructions.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang: Hospitals are Overcrowded</h3>
<p>Hospitals in the provincial capital have experienced a surge in patients in the past two weeks, with many wards being overcrowded. A continuous stream of patients are seeking outpatient treatment. According to reports, the source of the illnesses is the extremely hot weather. Among them, poor people who indulge in cold food or like to sleep outdoors are the most numerous. Statistics show that over 60 people have died in various hospitals from heatstroke.</p>
<h3>Arson Attack on Survey Team Again</h3>
<p>The pilot line team of the Zhenjiang Land Survey Team of the Jiangsu Provincial Survey General Team was previously attacked by rioters in the Xiaodagang Sanmaogong area of the fifth district, who burned surveying instruments and equipment and injured team members. It was previously reported. Unexpectedly, just as one wave subsided, another arose. On the afternoon of the 16th, the third team, stationed at the Dongyue Temple in Dagang Town, was suddenly attacked by local rioters who burned all the instruments and luggage to the ground and beat up a surveyor. The team, according to the report of the third team leader Li Qigen, telegraphed the county government and the county land bureau, requesting them to take measures to rescue them. It is reported that the bureau, after receiving the report, telegraphed the provincial authorities that night, requesting rescue. Efforts are being made to handle the aftermath of all the distressed team members. It is reported that there were 35 people in the team. Only a few managed to escape last night, and the rest of the team members barely escaped. The injured surveyor has been taken to the provincial hospital for treatment. It is also reported that the losses this time are even greater than the last.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Five Agencies Petition Provincial Government</h3>
<p>The Jiangdu County Party Headquarters, Construction Bureau, Education Bureau, Education Bureau, Property Management Office, and Public Security Bureau, due to the implementation of the county treasury system, have no room for adjusting or transferring funds. They have jointly telegraphed the Finance Department, requesting them to instruct the Bank of Communications and Bank of China, acting as agents for the treasury, to allow each bank to overdraw 20,000 yuan per month to avoid hindering administrative efficiency and the progress of work. On the morning of the 17th, the County Party Headquarters Standing Committee member Yu Peiren, Education Bureau Director Xin Fang, and Public Security Bureau Director Zhang Shu were publicly elected as representatives to visit Zhao, the Director of the Finance Department, in person to petition. They were received by Chief Secretary Xu Gongmei, who promised to relay their intentions to the Director and respond later.</p>
<h3>Funing: Oppressive Climate Kills Many</h3>
<p>The weather has been hot recently, with the Fahrenheit thermometer reading 102 degrees indoors where there is no sunlight, and 108-109 degrees under the scorching sun. The climate is exceptionally oppressive. Workers from the Hede Company who were hoeing weeds in the cotton fields have had 12 workers die from the heat in the past two days. Two cotton hoeing workers from Fuyu Company have died from the heat, and many have suffered heatstroke. Also, in Chenliangzhuang, the southern countryside, a farmer over 60 years old who was watching a play suffered from the heat, cried out and died. The temperature is still the same today. There are very few pedestrians in the city, and business is exceptionally sluggish as a result.</p>
<h3>County Magistrate Telegrams Province to Resign</h3>
<p>Li Jinfang, the County Magistrate of Funing, suddenly telegraphed the provincial government and the Department of Civil Affairs yesterday, requesting to resign from his post. It is reported that the reason for his resignation is the suffering in the current environment, which his emotions cannot tolerate. The Education Association, upon hearing this news, telegraphed the provincial government today, requesting that he be persuaded to stay.</p>
<h3>Huzhou: Bandits Plunder Xintang Town</h3>
<p>Xintang Town, which belongs to Changxing County, is one of the exits of Taihu Lake. The town has more than 30 stores, and business is relatively prosperous. Unexpectedly, at around 2:00 AM the day before yesterday, a gang of 60-70 bandits suddenly arrived, armed with various firearms. They fired dozens of shots in the town and then proceeded to loot all the stores and residences. No one in the town was spared.</p>
<h3>Haimen: Pirates Active at the Border of Tonghai</h3>
<p>The ports of Daan and Songji at the border of Tonghai have always been a den of pirates. Since the rampant pirate activity two years ago, which was suppressed by government troops, the pirates have scattered along the coast of Lvsi. Recently, due to the prolonged drought and disasters, the people are in a state of panic, and the pirates have seized the opportunity to become active again. Team Leader Chen of the Water Police has ordered strict precautions to be taken.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Supervisory Committee Member Tongyi Comments on Wang Jingwei's Remarks</h3>
<p>The Far Eastern News Agency reports that because Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei made remarks about the powers of the Control Yuan the day before yesterday, the Far Eastern News Agency reporter interviewed Control Yuan member Zeng Tongyi, who gave the following opinion:</p>
<p>In the case of the impeachment of Gu Mengyu by Control Yuan members Liu and Hou Wu, the original text of the impeachment and the rebuttals of Gu and Liu regarding the facts of the case have been disclosed in various newspapers. Since this case has been submitted to the Disciplinary Committee for Political Officials of the National Government, the truth will naturally be determined fairly. Gu Mengyu is an official of the Executive Yuan. Since he has been impeached, Wang, as the head of the Executive Yuan and the leader of the Party, if his subordinate is suspected of illegal activities, he should at least order a secret investigation to reveal the truth to the people, even if he cannot blame himself and resign. If the facts are confirmed, he might as well dismiss him directly to show the bright attitude of a great statesman. But instead of doing this, he seems to be unable to rest easy. He both defends him and wants to restrict the exercise of the power of impeachment. Those who do not know will suspect that Mr. Wang is shielding his private affairs, or even destroying the fundamental system of the country. This is not what a wise man should do. Mr. Wang's remarks yesterday were dedicated to explaining the resolution of the Central Political Committee last Wednesday to amend the impeachment law of the Control Yuan. This further shows that this case was initiated by Mr. Wang. The Central Political Committee is the highest body for resolving disputes between the five Yuan. Mr. Wang's method of restricting the Control Yuan's impeachment case happened to coincide with the Control Yuan's impeachment of Gu Mengyu. This has already shown the world an unfairness. After carefully examining his remarks, there are also many contradictions. For example, he said that no major matter of the five Yuan needs to be submitted to the Central Political Committee for approval. Then, the Railway Department's purchase of materials and borrowing of money is not a major matter. Why has it not been submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review or to the Central Political Committee for approval? The scope of major and minor matters should be based on the matter, not the person. If the purchase of materials and borrowing of money amounts to tens of millions, it is still a minor matter. As for the impeachment of one of the subordinates of the Executive Yuan, it is already a major matter, and the Central Political Committee is willing to amend the law for it. Isn't this too much? He also said that punishing corruption should be as important as safeguarding integrity. But punishing corruption is precisely to safeguard integrity. The meaning of the power of supervision is that those who speak are not guilty and those who hear are warned. If those suspected of corruption are heavily protected, it will only make the honest people suffer unjustly, and I am afraid that it is not the way for the Executive Yuan to clarify officialdom. Article 3 of the Central Political Committee's resolution states that documents concerning national policy and China's important position in the international community must not be disclosed without the approval of the Central Political Committee. Mr. Wang added a detailed explanation, thinking that political officials have to keep secrets for the benefit of the country. This is even more targeted at the Gu case. I don't know that the purchase of materials and borrowing of money was established as early as March last year, even before the US cotton loan. The US cotton loan alone is publicized, while the Railway Department's purchase of materials and borrowing of money must be kept secret. Isn't this a deceitful statement? In short, the colleagues of the Control Yuan have always admired Mr. Wang and the officials of the Executive Yuan. Even this impeachment of Gu Mengyu was intended to protect Mr. Wang. The colleagues are in poor shape and are often criticized by society for impeaching small officials, saying that they are chasing flies and mosquitoes. Mr. Wang should appreciate their courage, so that they are not afraid of the strong, and how can he further suppress them? Does he want to equalize the power of supervision with a mere setup? Therefore, for Mr. Wang's remarks, only the main points are discussed slightly, and I am not willing to spend too much time on them.</p>
<h3>Huang Shaoxiong Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday, Stays for a Day or Two and Returns to Beijing to Transfer to Jiangxi to Meet Chiang</h3>
<h3>Mr. Huang Denies That This Trip Has Political Implications</h3>
<p>Minister of the Interior Huang Shaoxiong, having completed his official duties in the south, accompanied by his wife and secretary Shi Chuchen, as well as servants, a total of five people, returned north from Hong Kong on the French mail ship Qin Nuoxue. They arrived in Shanghai at around 5:00 AM yesterday morning. Mr. Huang gave a speech on the ship, denying that this trip had any political mission. He plans to stay in Shanghai for a day or two and then return to Beijing and transfer to Jiangxi to meet Chiang. Details of the various situations are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Arrival Situation</h3>
<p>Those who went to the pier yesterday morning to welcome him, apart from Mr. Huang's friends and relatives in Shanghai, included only Director of the Public Security Bureau Wen Hongen and more than 20 reporters from the newspapers. The ship entered the port at around 4:00 AM and docked at the China Merchants Bureau's Central Wharf on Broadway Road at 5:00 AM. Due to waiting for customs inspection, it did not dock until 6:00 AM. After Mr. Huang finished breakfast on the ship, he greeted the welcoming personnel and disembarked with his wife and others at 6:30 AM. He took the car that came to meet him and returned directly to his residence on West Axim Road.</p>
<h3>Mission of This Trip</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Huang's speech on the ship to a reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency, he made this trip to the south because he had not returned to his hometown in Guangxi Province for a long time. It was also to inspect the political situation in Guangdong and Guangxi. It was entirely a private act and had no political mission. The rumors that he went to Guangdong to explain the misunderstandings about the issues in North China to the Southwest and to reconcile Yunnan and Guizhou are all not true. He met with Chen (Jitang), Li (Zongren), Bai (Chongxi), and others, but they only talked about local political construction and economy, and did not involve the overall situation.</p>
<h3>Southwest Opinion</h3>
<p>Mr. Huang continued to say that their (referring to Chen, Li, etc.) opinion is that the central government and local governments should understand each other and cooperate in national construction in order to unite against foreign aggression. Various rumors outside are not credible. You must know that rumors are just rumors, and facts are facts. In the future, there will definitely be no such impact. As for the abolition of the two Southwest agencies, he did not mention it to the Southwest people on this trip. He also did not meet with Xiao Focheng.</p>
<h3>Mr. Hu Going Abroad</h3>
<p>A Xin Xin News Agency reporter then asked about the rumor that Mr. Hu Hanmin was going abroad. Mr. Huang replied that he only learned of this rumor when reading the Shanghai newspapers in Hong Kong. However, he had not heard of this rumor in Hong Kong, nor had he heard of it in Guangdong and Guangxi. Even the last time he met with Mr. Hu, he did not talk about it. The reporter then asked about Mr. Hu's opinion on the current situation. Mr. Huang smiled and said that his visit to Mr. Hu was purely a visit and did not involve the current situation.</p>
<h3>Politics of Guangdong and Guangxi</h3>
<p>Mr. Huang said that regarding the situation of bandit suppression in the south, he met with Commander-in-Chief Yu Hanmou in Guangdong, who told him that the military affairs of bandit suppression were progressing well and that they were now cooperating in encirclement and suppression. As for the politics of Guangdong and Guangxi, there have been significant progress, especially the economic plans of Guangdong Province, which have been quite successful. After arriving in Shanghai today, he plans to stay for a day or two and then return to Beijing and then go to Nanchang to meet Chairman Chiang.</p>
<h3>Ninghai Warship Returns from Japan Wang Shouting Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<h3>Going to Beijing in Two or Three Days</h3>
<p>The navy cruiser Ninghai went to Japan on the fifth of last month to participate in the funeral of Marshal Togo Heihachiro. Afterwards, it sailed to Kasado to undergo a major inspection. There, the gun emplacements were dismantled and re-lubricated. This work was completed on the 16th, and the ship, still under the command of Practice Fleet Commander Wang Shouting, left Japan and returned to Shanghai. It entered port at seven o'clock yesterday morning, and at nine-thirty dropped anchor in the Huangpu River at Gaochangmiao. The first Fleet Naval personnel stationed in Shanghai and staff member Li all went to welcome him. After coming ashore, Wang visited Naval Affairs Deputy Minister and First Fleet Commander Chen Jiliang at the Fleet Headquarters for a meeting. According to Vice-Adjutant Cen of the training fleet, who spoke to a reporter from China East News Agency, the Ninghai warship underwent inspection for about 20 days at the Kasado shipyard in Japan. Overseas Chinese in Japan were ecstatic at seeing their home country's warship. There were also many people who came to see the ship. At the time, the weather in Japan was only about 80 degrees, not as hot as our country. It is now determined that the warship will proceed to Beijing within the next two or three days.</p>
<h3>There Were Showers Again Yesterday Morning</h3>
<h3>Hurricane May Not Come to Shanghai</h3>

In addition to places directly hit by the wind, the upper reaches of the Yangtze River may also be slightly affected by the wind wing.</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that after several rains in the city since the day before yesterday, people's hearts have calmed down slightly, and rice prices have also fallen sharply.

Glutinous rice fell by 10 cents and sold for 12.1 yuan. It is said that the trend is still downward. According to a telephone call from Wuxi yesterday morning, japonica rice was previously sold for 5.3 yuan per shi (unit of measure), and yesterday, due to rain, it fell to 4.9 yuan.</p>

<h3>Machine Federation: Exerting Utmost Effort to Promote National Goods</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Letters Were Sent Separately to Hotels and Restaurants in Provinces and Cities Throughout the Country</p>
<p>Requesting the Hanging of National Goods Samples to Allow Travelers to Follow the Pictures to Find Them</p>
<p>The Shanghai Machine-Made National Goods Factories Federation, in order to universally promote national goods, yesterday sent letters to hotels and restaurants in provinces and cities throughout the country, as well as to various national goods organizations. The letter stated: "Respected Sirs, Our Federation, in view of the increasingly rampant dumping of enemy goods and the lack of adequate understanding of national goods among our people, feels deeply concerned. Last autumn, we collected machine-made national goods products imitating foreign styles from various factories and printed samples so that even illiterate women and children could recognize the goods by looking at the pictures and know that our national goods are as good as foreign goods. We believe that as a national goods organization, our Federation should do its best to promote national goods. However, a loud call relies on the response of the mountains, and the popularity of national goods depends on consistent promotion. We have long known that your grand hotel is a famous residence in Shanghai, with a constant stream of guests coming and going. Your attentive service makes guests feel at home. If you could hang a copy of the sample book in each room, travelers could not only find what they need by following the pictures, but also stem the tide of enemy goods and revitalize national industries in our country, benefiting both the people and the nation. Your grand hotel will have contributed to this effort. We are sending you a copy of the national goods sample book and respectfully hope that you will distribute it appropriately. We will be very grateful."</p>
<h3>In the First Five Months of This Year, Imports of Japanese Goods Decreased Due to Increased Tariffs</h3>

<h3>Datong Waste Mine Company Secures a Loan of Two Million Yuan From the Banking Sector to Build a Mine-to-Bangbu Railway and Dig New Wells The Contract Has Been Signed With an Interest Rate of Eight Percent and Repayment in Five Years</h3>
<p>The Datong Coal Mine Company's coal mine is located in Huaiyuan County, Anhui Province, and the general manager is Zhu Yonghe. Now, in order to build a heavy-rail railway from the coal mine to Bangbu for coal transportation, the route is 120 li long. In addition, a large new well will be opened in the coal mine. A loan of two million yuan was borrowed from Shanghai Jiaotong Bank, Guohua Bank, and the Four Banks Savings Society, with the mine as collateral. Four-fifths, or 1.6 million yuan, will be used to build the railway from the mine to Bangbu, and one-fifth, or 400,000 yuan, will be used to open a new large well in the mine.</p>
<h3>Contract Signed</h3>
<p>The loan of two million yuan has now been negotiated between the Datong Coal Mine Company, Jiaotong Bank, Guohua Bank, and the Four Banks Savings Society. The interest rate is eight percent, and it will be repaid in five years. The loan contract was signed a few days ago. The method of payment will be determined based on the engineering needs when the railway and the new well begin construction. The collateral is the mine. The plan for building the heavy-rail railway from the mine to Bangbu and the new large well has been drafted.</p>
<h3>Completion in Two Years</h3>
<p>The Datong Coal Mine produces about six to seven hundred tons of coal per day. After the completion of the new project, namely the construction of the mine-to-Bangbu railway and the new large well, the daily coal output can be increased fourfold and transportation will be faster. The project has already started bidding and construction, and is originally scheduled to be completed in two years. However, whether the name of the railway is Mine-Bangbu has not yet been determined. The company's capital is entirely from Chinese merchants.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Replies to the Municipal Government Regarding Measures to Restrict Transshipment Cargo</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government, in response to the request from the Sugar Industry Association and other organizations in the city to levy wharf dues on transshipment goods, forwarded the request to the Ministry of Finance. The reply stated that transshipped goods are not limited to sugar. If wharf dues are levied on all transshipped goods, it would be difficult to implement. The Customs Administration has been instructed, and the Customs Commissioner has drafted two measures to restrict transshipment goods in order to crack down on illegal activities: (1) Those with through bills of lading destined for other ports; (2) Those with ordinary bills of lading destined for the first port of entry, but who apply to customs for transshipment before unloading and declare that they will no longer import the goods at the first port of entry are allowed to transship. Other foreign goods must be declared and imported as soon as they arrive at the port and are not allowed to be transshipped. Please investigate and inform them accordingly.</p>
<h3>Tobacco and Alcohol Merchants Request the Finance Bureau to Allow the Exchange of Old Licenses for New Ones The Bureau Replies That It Will Follow the Regulations of the Ministry</h3>
<p>Since the tobacco and alcohol license tax in this city has been transferred from the central government to local management, tobacco and alcohol merchants have been reporting to the various tax collection offices under the Finance Bureau to apply for licenses. Most of them have been verified by the tax collection offices and new licenses have been issued. Furthermore, tobacco and alcohol merchants recently requested the Finance Bureau to allow the exchange of old licenses for new ones. The Bureau replied that the collection of this tax must be carried out in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the Ministry. Whether the old licenses comply with the regulations must be verified. Therefore, it was immediately approved that there was no need for discussion.</p>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau issued a public notice yesterday stating: "It has been found that the detailed rules for the implementation of the tobacco and alcohol license tax stipulate that the period from the 1st to the 10th of January, April, July, and October each year is the period for exchanging old licenses for new ones. Those who fail to do so within the time limit will be given a written warning by the collecting agency and will be given a ten-day extension to facilitate the exchange of licenses. Those who repeatedly fail to exchange their licenses within the time limit will, in addition to being ordered to pay taxes and exchange licenses, be fined according to their tax payable. In addition, new operators who pay taxes and obtain licenses in any month of a quarter will be calculated as one quarter. Since the tobacco and alcohol license tax was transferred to local collection on July 1 of this year, many tobacco and alcohol merchants in the urban area have come to this Bureau to pay taxes and obtain licenses in accordance with the regulations, but there are also quite a few who have delayed exchanging their old licenses for new ones. Since it is the beginning of the takeover, written warnings cannot be sent to merchants who have not applied for licenses. In addition to sending a letter to the Public Security Bureau ordering a thorough investigation and requesting the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to urge the exchange of licenses, and reporting to the Municipal Government for record, this urgent notice is hereby issued to all merchants in the industry to be aware that all those who have not reported and obtained new licenses must pay taxes and obtain licenses for business by the end of July. If they exceed the time limit again, they will be investigated and dealt with in accordance with the regulations. Do not wait and see and make mistakes. This notice."</p>

(4) After discussion by the members, the following resolutions were passed: (A) Proceed in accordance with the resolution of the representatives of various associations on the 17th. (B) Notify members that if the authorities threaten or extort them before the Municipal Chamber of Commerce obtains a resolution from the Municipal Government, they should send a letter to the Union for referral to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for mediation. (C) Jointly with tobacco and alcohol industry groups, extract the history of the tobacco and alcohol industries suffering from the license tax and the reasons for their inability to increase their burden.

<h3>Patriotic Martyrs Liu Chongwu and Others to Be Tried Today The Municipal Federation Hosts a Banquet for Lawyers Mother Pan Requests Bail for Pan Hongsheng</h3>
<p>Various organizations, including the Municipal Citizens' Federation, believe that the patriotic martyrs Liu Chongwu, Pan Hongsheng, Tian Shuiyang, and Cao Songshou were motivated by righteous indignation when they bombed treacherous merchants, resulting in their entanglement in the law. Their crimes are excusable. The Supreme Court has ordered the Shanghai High Court No. 2 Branch to return the case for retrial. In addition to sending a letter to the court requesting lenient treatment, the night before last, they hosted a banquet for lawyers at the Dongwu Club on the third floor of the Continental Arcade on Nanjing Road to study the legal issues of the case. Those invited included Li Ruixin, Zhang Shizhao, Yu Hualong, Ma Junshuo, and more than ten other lawyers, as well as Chen Jicheng, Chen Binghui, Wang Jingdong, Liu Zhongying, Cao Zhigong, Chen Jiufeng, Qu Zhenhua, and others, totaling more than thirty people. First, lawyer Ma Junshuo reported on the facts of the case and the process of the three trials. Then, the lawyers contributed many opinions on the case. They did not disperse until 10 o'clock. It is reported that Li Ruixin and more than ten other lawyers will serve as volunteer defenders at the trial today.</p>
<p>The First Special District Citizens' Federation sent a letter to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court yesterday, stating: "Honorable Sirs, According to a letter from Pan Shi, the family member of the patriotic martyr Pan Hongsheng, stating that her son Hongsheng, out of patriotic enthusiasm and righteous indignation, took action to warn treacherous merchants who sold Japanese goods. He asked himself that he had absolutely no intention of premeditated murder or selfish profit. He has been detained for twenty months since being arrested. The case has been investigated and tried repeatedly by the police station and is now being held in the Ward Road Prison. During this period, the physical and mental suffering suffered by her son cannot be described in words, especially when he was in the police station. Unfortunately, he contracted pulmonary tuberculosis and his condition is very serious. It is impossible for a person who has lost his freedom and is in an oppressive environment to receive proper treatment. Therefore, his condition is getting worse day by day, resulting in coughing up blood and being unable to stand for a moment. His life is in danger. The prison officials are well aware of this but turn a blind eye. Both her husband and she are over sixty years old, and they are both old and frail. Their food and clothing are provided by Hongsheng's labor. Her husband was so distressed by Hongsheng's unjust imprisonment that he almost died and lost his sight. She is also suffering from illness due to depression and is barely surviving. In this situation, if Hongsheng dies in prison again, her husband and she will inevitably starve to death in a ditch. If he dies, she and her husband will have no choice but to die together. The depth of their pain is indescribable. When she thinks of this, she cannot help but shed tears and her heart is breaking. We have long admired your association for taking the protection of citizens as its responsibility and for providing legal assistance to her son without reservation. In addition to applying to the High Court No. 2 Branch for bail, we are writing to request your association to forward the letter to the court and beg for special consideration and approval of bail so that he can go out for medical treatment to save his life. We will be extremely grateful." Based on this, it is found that Pan Hongsheng's actions were out of patriotic indignation to warn treacherous merchants who sold Japanese goods. He had absolutely no intention of premeditated murder or selfish profit. His imprisonment is truly pitiable. In addition, he is now suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis and coughing up blood, and his condition is getting worse day by day. If he is not treated, his life is in danger. Since our association has received a request for assistance from his family, we respectfully request your court to grant bail out of special consideration so that he can go out for medical treatment to save his life. Protecting the law and loving the people will benefit both. We hope you will investigate and act accordingly.</p>

<h3>Gangsters Plan a Major Riot in Huizhou Store, Qin Family Town, Pudong Fortunately, Zhu Alan Was Killed After Prior Detection Zhu Shaoqing Was Arrested in the Search for the Remaining Gang Members</h3>
<p>Huizhou Store in Qin Family Town, six or seven miles southwest of Zhangjiang Fence Town, Nanhui County, Pudong, has always been a den of bandits. The bandit leader Zhu Alan opened teahouses in two places to recruit bandits. He had hundreds of followers. Usually, they made a living by selling women, selling poisonous substances, and extorting money. After the autumn harvest, they instructed their followers to rob in all directions. The number of kidnapping and theft cases committed over the years is countless. They have been arrested by the county government more than ten times. Recently, the bandit secretly contacted the giant bandits of Nicheng, Zhoupu, and Yanpu to secretly purchase a large number of military supplies, intending to carry out riots simultaneously in the towns of Hengmian, Chen Tuiguan Bridge, Zhangjiang Fence, and Beicai. A few days ago, the county police team was transferred to Songjiang for review, and the various security regiments were ordered to be transferred to the county for deployment. The bandit planned to secretly agree with his accomplices to start the incident on a specific date. Unexpectedly, the plan was leaked and reported to the county government. County Chief Yuan secretly ordered the Sixth Public Security Bureau to arrest the bandit. After receiving the order, the Public Security Bureau immediately investigated and arrested the bandit leader Zhu Alan at Niujiaojian on the (16th). On the night of the 17th, the bureau secretly sent police to escort him to the county for interrogation. Unexpectedly, his accomplices heard about it and ambushed in the fields near Lujia Bridge, preparing to intercept him. When they approached, they unexpectedly fired guns to try to rob the escorting police. While they were fighting hard to resist and repelling the bandits, the prisoner Zhu Alan broke free and forcibly seized the firearms from the patrol officer's hand. At that moment of chaos and crisis, the bandit Zhu Alan was shot and killed by stray bullets. It is said that the Public Security Bureau has reported the incident to the county government and found a bag of bullets in his home.</p>
<h3>Smoking Monk Fined at Dizang Temple Monks Inhaling Clouds and Spitting Fog Donors' Incense Money Used for Cigarettes</h3>
<p>Hui Lun (also known as Kuan Yang Monk), the abbot of Dizang Temple, a sub-temple of Jiuhuashan at No. 3, Sanduo Lane, Chengdu Road, is addicted to opium. He spends all day lying in bed, inhaling clouds and spitting fog. However, he is very good at serving donors, so his life is not bad. His income from incense money, in addition to providing for his daily opium consumption, still leaves a huge amount of money for him to enjoy. Recently, Xing Peisong, the Chinese head of the Xinzha Police Station, received the above report and requested a search warrant from the First Special Court. At 11:00 a.m. yesterday, he went to the temple to search and found a full set of exquisite smoking paraphernalia under Hui Lun's bed. The monk was taken to the police station. Hui Lun immediately requested bail and was granted bail for 500 yuan in cash. However, the monk stated that he did not want to be tried in court tomorrow. Head Constable Xing told him that if he did not go to court, not only would the bail be confiscated, but a warrant would also be issued for his arrest. Hui Lun went to the police station with his lawyer yesterday morning. Police Lawyer Zhang Shizhu prosecuted him under Article 11 of the Anti-Opium Law, stating that since the defendant is a monk, he should abide by the law. However, he is deeply addicted to opium, which is inappropriate. Furthermore, it is heard that the defendant has considerable wealth, so he requested severe punishment to serve as a warning to others. When interrogated, Hui Lun admitted to smoking opium for two years. Judge Zhou Chengqin reviewed the confession and sentenced Hui Lun to a fine of 300 yuan, and the smoking paraphernalia was confiscated.</p>
<h3>How Can Opium Ash Relieve Pain? A Mother's Confusion Leads to Her Daughter's Death</h3>
<p>Wang Guizhen, a 13-year-old girl from Anhui, lived at No. 9, Menggu Road, Zhabei. At around 9:00 a.m. yesterday, Guizhen suddenly felt pain in her abdomen. At the time, she thought it was caused by the cold at night, so she didn't care. Unexpectedly, at around 11:00 a.m., the pain suddenly worsened and became excruciating. She felt flustered and told her mother. At that time, her mother was lying in bed, inhaling clouds and spitting fog. After hearing this, she took a pinch of opium ash and ordered her daughter to swallow it. Soon, the pain stopped a little, but Guizhen became unconscious. About an hour later, she suddenly started to feel pain again, tossing and turning on the bed and calling out frequently. The mother still thought that the medicine hadn't worked, and didn't care at all. She told her daughter to calm down and be patient. Unexpectedly, soon she saw that Guizhen's face was pale and her breathing was rapid. She realized that the amount of opium ash she had taken was too much, and she tried to make her vomit it out, but it didn't work. She quickly took her to Shilong Hospital for treatment, but it was too late. The time had passed too long, and she had been poisoned too deeply. She died without being saved. The hospital reported it to the police station, and the body was sent to the coroner's office. After reporting to the court for inspection this morning, it will be coffined and buried.</p>
<h3>A Bag of White Powder A Woman Dies Tragically After Taking It How Can Toothache Mistake Medicine Powder? Yang Jin Xian Cannot Escape Responsibility</h3>
<p>Yang Yizhang, from Gaohang, Pudong, is one of the shareholders of Luming Inn on Sanma Road. His wife has passed away, and he remarried Zhou Shi, the sister of Zhou Bulian, as his second wife. Yang Jin Xian, the son of Yang's previous wife, is 25 years old. Seven years ago, he married Xiao Shi (24 years old), the daughter of Xiao Qu Shi (also from Gaohang). After the marriage, the couple's relationship was still harmonious. They had a son, who is now five years old. Yang Yizhang lives with his son, daughter-in-law, and other family members at No. 4, Zhoujia Lane, north of Tanjiabao Bridge, Zhabei, the home of his wife's younger brother Zhou Bulian. Because the Zhou family happened to have extra rooms, and Yang Yizhang worked at the Luming Inn, and Yang Jin Xian also worked as a doctor in Shanghai, it was convenient for them to take care of each other, so the family moved to Shanghai. Recently, a few days ago, Yang Xiao Shi suffered from a cold and fever, which had not subsided for several days. Her husband Yang Jin Xian prescribed several doses of medicine for her to take, and she gradually recovered. On the night of the 16th of this month, Yang Xiao Shi suddenly suffered from a toothache, which was extremely severe. She could not sit or lie down, and frequently cried out in pain. Her husband Yang Jin Xian had already gone to bed. He heard the noise and got up to take a white powder to stop the toothache and gave it to his wife to swallow. Unexpectedly, after swallowing the powder, Xiao Shi shouted that her abdomen was in excruciating pain, rolling around on the bed, her hands and feet spasming. She questioned that what she swallowed must not be toothache powder, otherwise why would her intestines feel like they were being cut with a knife and all the blood vessels had contracted? Yang Jin Xian was also panicked and said that he was flustered for a moment and might have taken the wrong powder. The atmosphere in the family became tense. Some wanted to take her to the hospital, which might save her, while others said that it would be more appropriate to call a doctor for treatment. There were different opinions. As dawn approached, Yang Xiao Shi died. The Pengpu Township Security Corps in the area found out about the matter and, fearing that there was something else going on, immediately sent members to contact the local Yang Jin.</p>
<h3>The Second Special Court Continues to Try Yan Luqing's Alleged Extortion Case Chen Tingrui and Sun Zuji Describe the Situation at the Time The Prosecutor Advocates Adopting the Testimony of Witnesses as the Basis for the Judgment The Debate Concluded Yesterday and the Sentence Is Scheduled for the 23rd</h3>
<p>Lawyer Yan Luqing was previously accused by Zhou Jinggeng, the comprador of Xue Mailuo Accounting Firm, in the Second Special Court that Zhang Zuming, Zhuang Yuan, the owner of Dada Zaofang, Wang Lianyou, a metal runner, Tang Qingyue, the director of Dade Hospital, and others had robbed a large sum of money, and attached a private prosecution. During the hearing, Tang Qingyue's defense lawyers Sun Zuji and Chen Tingrui stated that lawyer Yan had extorted 2,000 yuan from Tang Qingyue's father, Tang Wenshou. Therefore, Prosecutor Wang sent a letter to the police department of the Law Patrol Room to file a public prosecution against lawyer Yan in the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court for violating Article 370 of the Criminal Law.</p>
<h3>Extortion by Intimidation</h3>
<p>The crime was prosecuted. The details have been recorded in previous reports. The trial continued yesterday. At 9:30, Judge Xiong Huiping and Chief Prosecutor Chen Beisan took the seat in the First Criminal Court. First, witness Chen Tingrui testified, "I am a lawyer. On June 20, the Tang family called and asked me to join in representing Tang Qingyue as a defense lawyer. So, at 4:00, I went to Sun Zuji's law firm and saw Tang Wenshou, Tang Qingyue's father, in the reception room, while lawyer Yan, lawyer Sun, and Zhou Jingsai were talking in another room. After a while, lawyer Sun and Tang Wenshou told me that they wanted money. I thought this matter was</p>
<h3>Extremely Illegal</h3>
<p>I wanted to tell Tang to report to the police, but Tang Wenshou was afraid of hurting the mouse in trying to catch the vase, so he didn't report it. At that time, I said to Yan and Zhou, "Lawyers shouldn't break the law." If Tang Qingyue really committed robbery, the court will judge them. I also said, "If there is money, there will be no problem. Otherwise, at the hearing, the four of them will insist that Tang is a robber." I also said, "Then I won't be a defense lawyer, but will change my position to be a witness. Why are you accusing him?" Yan said, "Then you don't have evidence." At this point, I left. Only when we were arguing on Xiafei Road did Yan actually get out of the car and talk to lawyer Sun. The official asked lawyer Yan, "Did you hear his words?" Yan replied, "I didn't go to Sun's office that day, June 20. I handled an inheritance case at the High Court No. 2 Branch before. Chen was the lawyer in the first trial, but he failed. I took over in the second trial and was</p>
<h3>Reported in the Newspapers</h3>
<p>Therefore, Chen was unhappy to see it. Today's words are completely false. I am afraid it is because of the resentment from before." The official asked lawyer Chen if there was any resentment before. Chen replied, "I have no grudges with Yan. The facts of the case are there." At this point, witness Huang Xingzhong was questioned. "I opened the Star Modern Clothing Store on Xiafei Road. On the 21st of last month, Pan Hongding came with lawyer Sun and others and asked me to vouch for Tang Qingyue." The official asked, "What did you see?" Huang replied, "I saw lawyer Sun say to Pan Hongding in English, 'Two thousand yuan, do you agree?'" I also saw lawyer Sun and the</p>
<h3>Two People Arguing</h3>
<p>In the car behind for about two or three minutes, but the defendant Yan Luqing did not get out of the car. The official ordered Sun Zuji to be brought to the court and asked, "What did you say to Pan Hongding in front of the Star Clothing Store on Xiafei Road?" Sun replied, "I didn't say anything." The official asked again, "Think again. What did you say, or did you say anything to Pan in English?" At this point, Sun suddenly replied, "Yes, I did say the words 'two thousand yuan' in English. Mr. Pan may not be proficient in English." At this point, the judge said, "Why are your words inconsistent? First you said you didn't know, then you said you did." Sun said, "I was in a hurry at the time. I also told Mr. Pan to talk to Yan." The official also asked Zhou Jingsai, "Did you talk to lawyer Sun at the clothing store on Xiafei Road?" Zhou replied, "I was in the car. I passed by the area, and lawyer Sun greeted me to talk to him. He said that Tang's family was willing to</p>
<h3>Settle the Private Prosecution</h3>
<p>For two thousand yuan." However, lawyer Yan never talked to him. Witness Tang Lianggui was also questioned. "I opened the Shanghai Western Restaurant on the ground floor of No. 49 Sichuan Road. Lawyer Yan had lunch and dinner at my shop on the 21st. Zhou Jingsai also came with three people later and dined together, and signed his name as proof." At this point, the official ordered the debate to begin. First, Police Lawyer Yao Zhaodi said, "Regarding the guilt of the defendant Yan Luqing in this case, judging from the facts and the law, when another case was being tried, it was lawyers Sun Zuji and Chen Tingrui who accused him. Later, the prosecutor sent a letter to the police department to prosecute him. Regarding whether Yan demanded extortion himself, or demanded extortion for others,</p>
<h3>Or Helped</h3>
<p>Extortion, when the defendant was questioned, he always denied it. Although the witnesses testified, whether it is consistent or there are contradictions, the case is prosecuted under Article 370, but the intimidation has not been definitively proven. If your court wants to adopt the testimony of the witnesses, then it should be prosecuted under Article 363, and I request that it be handled according to law." Then, Yan Luqing defended himself, "On the 20th, Sun Zuji and Qin Daoyuan came to my office, but I pushed them out. So, lawyer Sun thought it was the first great humiliation of his life, so he held a grudge. On the one hand, he wanted to use this point to make his client innocent. Regarding lawyer Chen, I have already explained the previous words. At the last hearing, lawyer Sun said that I</p>
<h3>Begging for Money Everywhere</h3>
<p>But Yan Luqing treats me like a child, thinking I would never go so crazy. It's just that I am usually rash and offend others. It has been found that when Tang Qingyue was escorted to the First Special Court on the 20th, Zhang Zuming testified that Tang Qingyue was standing outside the door during the robbery. Moreover, when at the police station on the 21st, the witness did not point him out. How can it be said that he was identified as the thief during the court hearing on the 23rd? There is no way to talk about this layer of intimidation. As for the fraud, I was always present and didn't know anything about it. Please declare me innocent. Furthermore, Prosecutor Chen rose and expressed his opinion, roughly saying whether Yan Luqing constitutes a criminal offense. The fact must prove whether Yan demanded 2,000 yuan. If there is a fact of asking for money, regardless of</p>
<h3>The Use of Money</h3>
<p>Before the debate on this theft case even begins, asking for money definitely constitutes a crime under Article 370 in law, which is not a problem. This prosecutor also believes that he should base his decision on the testimonies of various witnesses. The judge asked Tang Wenshou, saying, "What about your private prosecution?" Tang replied, "I request to withdraw the private prosecution." Yan Luqing said, "I have one more point to add. Sun Zuji is a lawyer and has been a judge. Since he believes the demand is illegal, why is he willing to hand over the money to Zhou Jingsai? It can be seen that this money is entirely for repaying the private prosecution, not extortion." Then, the attorneys Wang Shizong and Zhang Shanle defended everything on his behalf. Judge Xiong concluded the debate and scheduled the verdict for July 23rd.</p>
<p>Xian was detained and sent to the Fourth District Police Station. Yesterday morning, Jin Jiutu's land</p>
<p>Guarantor Yan Deshan petitioned the local court for an inspection. Soon after, the deceased's mother, Xiao Qushi, also petitioned the court to waive the inspection, stating roughly: "I am 56 years old, and I have a son and a daughter. My son is 16 years old, and my daughter is the deceased. I request to waive the inspection and am willing to arrange the burial," etc. The court ruled against it and ordered that the inspection be completed before further action.</p>
<h3>Fourteen-Year-Old Girl Commits Suicide by Poisoning Out of Despair Because of Stealing Copper Coins and Being Reprimanded, She Became Extremely Distressed and Inhaled Opium</h3>
<p>Cao Anfeng, a 14-year-old girl from Pinghu, lost her parents at a young age and was adopted by her aunt, Chen, who lived at No. 4, Jishou Lane, Danshui Road. She had been raised for several years, and they usually lived in peace. Unexpectedly, the girl suddenly stole several copper coins from her mother the other day. Chen discovered it and reprimanded her, even hitting her lightly to warn her in the future. However, after being reprimanded, the girl became extremely distressed and had the thought of ending her life. She secretly inhaled opium to commit suicide. When Chen discovered her, she saw her groaning in bed. She was immediately taken to Renji Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and she soon died. The hospital reported to the Chengdu Road Police Station, which ordered detectives to investigate. After investigation, the body was taken to the forensic examination center on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Guo Wei was dispatched by the First Special District Local Court to conduct an examination of the body. According to Chen Cao, she is 37 years old, from Suzhou. Her husband works in a bookstore. The deceased was originally her niece. Since her parents were both dead, Chen adopted her as her daughter. The other day, she stole several copper coins from Chen, who then advised her not to do this again in the future and even hit her once to teach her a lesson. Unexpectedly, she resorted to this extreme measure. After obtaining the statement, Guo ruled that the deceased Cao Anfeng, a female, had indeed died from opium poisoning. The body was handed over to her mother, Chen Cao, to take back for burial after signing a guarantee.</p>
<h3>First Special Court Notice: Litigants Must Arrive in Court on Time</h3>
<p>Those Who Are Late Will Not Be Questioned</p>
<p>Jiangsu Shanghai First Special District Local Court Notice No. 748: Regarding the notice, the court staff strictly adheres to the legal time for working in court. Usually, they start at 8:00 AM, and during the summer period, they start at 7:00 AM. All staff members arrive on time for strict attendance checks, without anyone being late. Since the judges arrive at court early, they can strictly adhere to the court's opening time. However, apart from public prosecution cases and police station staff witnesses, who can arrive on time, the litigants in other civil and self-prosecution cases often fail to arrive on time or are not all present. The judges have to leave the bench and wait, opening the court late, which often prevents all the cases scheduled for that day from being heard in time. Witnesses who are scheduled to testify later also suffer from waiting for a long time. This bad habit of being late must be corrected. Therefore, it is now approved that, starting from today, all presiding judges will still arrive in court on time, and cases will be heard in order according to the scheduled time. Litigants who report late will be considered absent and will not be questioned. Strictness is preferred over leniency to gradually cultivate good habits. This notice is hereby issued, and all litigants must be informed and must comply with the designated hearing time to arrive in court, sign in, and wait for questioning. Do not delay and harm yourselves. This notice is issued on July 18th.</p>
<h3>Rent Reduction Association Sends Representatives to Petition in the Capital Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Rent Reduction Committee believes that the market is becoming increasingly depressed and that rent reduction regulations have not yet been promulgated by the government. Yesterday, it specially sent representative Cao Zhigong to the capital with a petition to the Executive Yuan, requesting understanding and demanding that the Shanghai Municipal Government be ordered to promulgate rent reduction measures as soon as possible to comply with public opinion and maintain people's livelihood. The petition is recorded as follows: The petition is to reduce rents and restore the prosperity of Shanghai. It has been repeatedly submitted to your Yuan for review and approval, but to date, your Yuan has not ordered the municipal government to promulgate rent reduction measures, causing residents throughout the city to look forward to it day and night. Since the launch of rent reduction movements by various groups in the city, more than half a year has passed, and the atmosphere of rent reduction in the city is extremely tense. If it is not resolved quickly, rent disputes will inevitably increase day by day. However, the rent reduction movement was originally intended to restore the prosperity of the market and hope for a revival of commerce. As the price of rice has risen, the government has maintained the food supply and stabilized prices. Similarly, the high rents should also be reduced through compromise measures. Housing is one of the people's livelihood issues, and the government should be concerned and consider it, so that people can live in peace and enjoy their work. In order to relieve the people's livelihood and maintain the residents, the association specially appointed Cao Zhigong to submit a petition to your Yuan, hoping that you will order the Shanghai Municipal Government to formulate rent reduction measures as soon as possible to comply with public opinion and maintain the people's livelihood. Respectfully submitted to President Wang of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3>Two Railways Recruit Car Service Personnel</h3>
<p>The Military Affairs Department of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways is recruiting personnel due to the increasing development of the railways.

After being hired, there will be a six-month probationary period with a monthly salary of 20 yuan.

The deadline for registration is noon on the 20th of this month, and a written test will be held on the 24th. Those who are interested in applying must bring their credentials and four 4-inch half-length photos and a registration fee of one yuan to the North Station to register in person. Applications by mail or through intermediaries will not be accepted.</p>
<h3>The Public Works Department Specifies New-Style Rickshaws and Only Orders the Change to New Vehicles for Old Vehicles That Are Already Broken and Unusable</h3>
<p>Regarding the Public Works Department's regulations on changing public rickshaws to new-style standard construction and how old and new vehicles will be replaced, the rickshaw owners seem to have some misunderstandings. The Rickshaw Affairs Committee has no intention of suddenly changing all vehicles to new vehicles. The method is to wait until the new vehicle style is determined. Any old vehicles that are deemed unusable by the inspection department will be ordered to be replaced with new-style vehicles. The old vehicles that are still in good condition and usable will be allowed to continue to be used until they need to be replaced. It is not intended to immediately discard a large number of existing vehicles. This intention has already been clearly explained by the committee to the representatives of the rickshaw owners' association several times. The general rickshaw owners should know the truth.</p>

<p>The Shenshi Telegraph Agency held a garden party and tea party at Zhang's residence at No. 263, Jules Street, from 4:30 PM yesterday. More than 300 people from the Party, government, military, various countries' embassies and consulates, news, education, banking, industry, and other leading figures were in attendance. The event was warmly hosted by Chairman Du Yuesheng, General Manager Zhang Zhuping, Director Mi Xingru, and directors Li Shuxiong, Yu Zuoting, Zhang Jixian, Pan Gongbi, Dong XianGuang, Xiao TongZi, and all staff members of the agency. The details are recorded as follows:</p>

The agency prepared refreshments for the guests on the lawn in front of the circle. The corridors were filled with gifts from all walks of life, including silver shields, flower baskets, congratulatory messages, and handwritten inscriptions by various celebrities, which were extremely magnificent. After the speeches, there was also beautiful music to add to the guests' enjoyment.</p>
<h3>Chairman Du Yuesheng's Report</h3>
<p>After the meeting began, Chairman Du Yuesheng gave a report, saying that today is the tenth anniversary of the agency's founding. He felt very honored to have guests from all walks of life attend. The agency's purpose is to assist the development of news undertakings in various places. Since its establishment, it has been welcomed by the industry and praised by the society. This is something that colleagues can be proud of. However, the agency has been in existence for ten years. During this period, internal and external troubles have come one after another. The May 30th Massacre in Shanghai, the May 3rd Painful History in Jinan, the loss of the Northeast, the January 28th Songhu War, and the water and drought disasters in various places, and the turmoil of the communists, have occurred countless times. The agency was born at this time, and the news it provides every day gives people a shocking impression. Therefore, the past ten years have been a sad anniversary for the country and also a sad anniversary for the agency. I hope that in the next ten years, the political situation will be clear, the internal affairs will be peaceful, and the diplomacy will be victorious, so that the agency can report good news to everyone every day and bring joy to everyone. Then, the scene when the agency holds its 20th anniversary will be different from today.</p>
<h3>General Manager Zhang Zhuping's Report</h3>
<p>Next, General Manager Zhang Zhuping gave a report, saying, "Chairman, distinguished guests, the Shenshi Telegraph Agency has been established for ten years. Today, we are holding a tenth anniversary celebration here. I feel extremely honored to have you all here to celebrate together. When the Shenshi Agency was first established, very few people knew about it except for a few working colleagues and a few related newspapers. Because at that time, there were only two or three colleagues. Now, there are more than 30 people serving in the Shanghai head office alone, which is ten times more than before. Before, there was nothing else to do except for sending a few wired telegrams at night. Now, there are wired telegrams, wireless telegrams, long-distance calls, and wireless broadcasts in the night shift work, including receiving telegrams, sending telegrams, translating, editing, proofreading, and other tasks, which are much more complex and busy than before. The daytime telecommunications, the interviewing of local news, the compiling and sending of communications from various places, and the preparation for publishing and advertising are all unprecedented. In the past, only three or four hundred words of telegrams were sent every day. Now, the number of words received and sent every day is around 50,000. When it first started, because the affairs were simple, the monthly expenses were only two or three hundred yuan. Now, apart from the huge amount of electricity bills, the expenses for administrative affairs and salaries alone have reached more than 3,000 yuan per month. Therefore, no matter from which aspect, the evolution of the Shenshi Agency in the past ten years has increased the scope of various undertakings by more than ten or dozens of times. This is naturally due to the needs of the times and the guidance and assistance of all parties. From the standpoint of the Shenshi Agency itself and its relationship to the service of the entire journalism industry, it is really worthy of gratitude and commemoration. On the other hand, the Shenshi Agency has struggled for ten years in hardship and difficulty, and has gathered the strength of guidance and assistance from all sides, only to achieve today's achievements. However, these achievements have not been a surprising development. Compared with several major international news agencies, the disparity in their position and business is still shockingly different. From this, we can know that the reason why modern foreign news agencies can have today's achievements is really not a matter of luck. They all have a long history of several decades, have gathered countless outstanding talents, and have spent huge sums of money to reach their current state. This is a powerful lesson. From now on, the Shenshi Agency needs to continue to work hard and move forward, and needs the great assistance of all parties to guide and assist. We are more certain that the Shenshi Agency's efforts to move forward will never fail. There will be a harvest for every effort made, and the assistance from all parties will inevitably expand and increase along with its business. The news business in our country is currently still in its infancy, but its trend of rapid progress cannot be ignored. In particular, the telecommunications business is necessary for practical needs. Whether for the country, for the nation, for the society, or for the news business itself, it is necessary to actively promote its development. Because the development of the telecommunications business is unlimited, unlike a newspaper whose circulation is limited by region and language, a healthy and powerful telecommunications agency can not only express the meaning of society, but also represent the country and the nation, and promote justice and public reason. It can also be used to communicate the culture between countries and eliminate the barriers between races. It can not only use accurate and rapid news to develop its own business, but also directly affect the majority of newspapers, so that they can obtain valuable news under the most economical principles. Now, all civilized countries are sparing no effort to operate and cultivate the telecommunications business, and the news industry in various countries is also sparing no effort to assist and utilize the telecommunications business. We can understand how important the telecommunications business is in its position. For the sake of this business and our country's urgent needs, the Shenshi Agency was established. In the past ten years, the Shenshi Agency has not forgotten the importance of its mission, and will never forget this important mission and the only goal in the future. In such hot weather, your presence gives us unparalleled glory and encouragement. I just hope that you will forgive us for the rush of preparations and the inadequate reception. Now, I use our Chinese [national wine] (Shaoxing wine) to wish you all good health."</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu and Others Give Speeches in Succession</h3>
<p>Next, Mayor Wu gave a speech, saying that today is the tenth anniversary of the Shenshi Agency, and he was very honored to participate in the grand event. He had just learned from Mr. Zhang Zhuping's report that the growth of the Shenshi Agency is like a baby growing from birth to adulthood, gradually developing and becoming great. The efforts of the Shenshi Agency colleagues in nurturing and protecting it are admirable. The relationship between the news agency and the newspaper is like the red flower and the green leaves complementing each other. The peony loses its splendor and richness when it is separated from the green leaves. I hope that the gentlemen of the Shenshi Agency will continue to work hard, and that the news industry can give them as much support as possible, so that the future development can be expected. Next, Mr. Lin Kanghou, Secretary-General of the Banking Association, gave a speech, saying that news agencies must ["know what others cannot know and say what others cannot say."] Now all news is subject to inspection by government agencies before it can be released. Freedom of speech is not possible. I hope that in the future, colleagues in the news industry will fight for freedom and that government officials will give people the opportunity for freedom. Next, Mr. He DeKui, representative of the Public Works Department, gave a speech, saying that our country has never had a great telecommunications organization to report accurate news about the country to foreign countries. International news is almost entirely controlled by a few foreign-run news agencies, which often puts our country's political diplomacy in an isolated and unsuccessful position. I hope that the gentlemen of the Shenshi Agency will work hard to reverse this situation, which is the greatest work of saving the country. Next, Mr. Yu Zuoting, Director of the Society, President of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Mr. Yuan Ludeng, General Manager of Ning Shao Company, all gave sincere speeches. After each speech, it was translated by Xie Fusheng.</p>
<h3>Music Adds to the Fun, and Guests and Hosts Enjoy Themselves</h3>
<p>In addition to serving refreshments and holding meetings and speeches, the association also had entertainment to add to the fun: 1) Ms. Cao Baozhen's piano solo, 2) Piano duet by Hu Runde's son Yu Ren and daughter Ji Lin, 3) Chen Huikang's harmonica solo, 4) Cao Zhongxin, Pan Ruiqing, and Yang Wei's trio singing [O Sole Mio]. Listening to the gentle and clear sound in the setting sun and gentle breeze was very pleasant. In particular, the piano duet by the six-year-old child was the most outstanding and amazing, earning thunderous applause from the audience. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until 7:00 PM, when the event ended.</p>
<h3>Chen Lingyi, Wang Xiaoying, and Others Elected as Directors of the Education and Care Home</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Women and Children's Education and Care Home, affiliated with the Chinese Women's Temperance Association, held a board meeting at the Bank Club yesterday. More than a dozen of the appointed directors, including Mrs. Li Zhongdao, attended. Ms. Liu Wang Liming gave a welcome speech and reported on past work and future plans. The articles of association of the Education and Care Home and the board of directors were then approved, and Mrs. Wu Lao Weixiong was elected as president, Mrs. Zheng Wei as vice president, Ms. Wang Xiaoying as secretary, and Ms. Chen Lingyi as accountant. The second board meeting will be held in Jiangwan.</p>
<h3>Xu Shiying Sends a Letter Urging the Prompt Payment of Donations for the Construction of Mount Huangshan Because the Preliminary Project Requires Urgent Funds and Is Scheduled to Be Completed by September 30</h3>
<p>Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Municipal Relief Committee, sent a letter to the Xinwei Relief Association yesterday, urging them to promptly remit the remaining 500 yuan of their donation to be used for the construction of Mount Huangshan, as the funds required for the project are vast. The original letter is recorded as follows: "Respected Sirs, regarding the preliminary construction plan for Mount Huangshan, we previously received a donation of 1,000 yuan for construction, and we have already received 500 yuan. We deeply appreciate your enthusiasm for developing famous mountains and your dedication to public welfare. The plan is scheduled to be completed by September 30. As the project is huge and requires urgent funds, we are sending this letter to earnestly request that you promptly remit the remaining 500 yuan of your donation to the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank for collection, so that it can be used for Mount Huangshan and be completed as scheduled. We look forward to your reply. Respectfully, Xu Shiying, Relief Committee."</p>
<h3>The Qunyi Science Society Will Re-Experiment with the Aquatic Safety Belt Today The Demonstration Will Take Place at Donggou at 2:00 PM for General Understanding and Open to the Public</h3>
<p>The aquatic safety belt invented by the Shanghai Qunyi Public Interest Science Society was publicly tested at the Gaoqiao Seaside Bathing Beach the other day. Its excellent performance and unique efficacy were highly praised by people from all walks of life who attended the event. All the details were reported in the previous newspaper. It is now learned that the society decided to re-experiment at Donggou at 2:00 PM today to widely recognize the effectiveness of the belt among people in this city, as the rickshaw storm that suddenly occurred in Gaoqiao that day caused many people to turn back halfway. The experiment is open to the public and will be a grand event.</p>
<h3>The Car Committee Decides on New Car Regulations Special District Car Dealers Request a Postponement of Implementation</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng She, the rickshaw industry in the special district of this city has learned that the Public Works Department has decided that, starting from August, anyone applying for a public rickshaw license must have the car owner certificate issued by the Special District Rickshaw Affairs Committee, otherwise it will not be issued. It is also stated that if the number of existing car owners holding certificates is insufficient, the Car Committee is prepared to accept petitions from new car owners or existing car owners who are willing to comply with the departmental regulations to request an increase in the number of vehicles. The period from July 25 to 29 is set as the petition period. The spokesperson of the Special District Office of the Shanghai Rickshaw Industry Association made a statement to reporters as follows:</p>
<h3>Car Owner Certificate Is As Good As Nothing</h3>
<p>The Public Concession restricted the number of public rickshaws to 10,000 in 1924, licensed to the original 144 households of owners, and would never increase the number or issue licenses to new car owners again. This has been the fixed policy of the Public Works Department for more than a decade. However, since the Rickshaw Affairs Committee proposed the so-called real car owner registration plan, which is now being handled by the Rickshaw Affairs Committee, not only is anyone free to apply for a transfer, but the car owner certificate issued actually contains hesitant and ambiguous words, which is the greatest joke in the world as a document proving property rights. The words are: "For the purpose of proof, according to a certain car owner claiming to be the current owner of the public rickshaw with the following license numbers of this Bureau, unless sufficient evidence is found, this Bureau will assume that what he claims is true and, within the restrictions of the rules printed on the back of this certificate and the rules for the implementation of public rickshaw licenses, regard the above-mentioned applicant as the car owner, this certificate." Such a certificate is as good as nothing, causing widespread concern and indignation. Therefore, many people have come to this office to ask for instructions and request that it be responsible for proving their ownership and obtaining licenses to protect their property. Therefore, this office appointed representatives for the past two days to inquire with the Car Committee of the Public Works Department about the issuance of car owner certificates and expressed its willingness to assist in handling the matter to avoid speculation and protect the property rights of car owners and maintain business security. The committee has promised to handle the matter carefully.</p>
<h3>Expansion of Vehicle Quota and Changes in Restrictions</h3>
<p>However, there has been no news of new vehicle owners being invited to obtain licenses from the 25th to the 29th, or that existing vehicle owners who wish to expand their quotas must request various measures. This propaganda not only changes the 10,000 public rickshaw limit set by the Shanghai Municipal Council, but also lacks clear expression in the resolutions of the board of directors, causing deep suspicion and anxiety. It is found that the members of our office have never violated the regulations for business. Even for the recently announced new vehicle regulations, they only made reasonable requests on impossible items and have never had any negative reactions. There should be no obstacles to obtaining a license. Only because the vehicle committee issued a "presumed" certificate of vehicle ownership, there is suspicion. In addition to members flocking to our office to ask for certification for license application, representatives have also been sent to the vehicle committee to request a detailed review to issue a real property certificate. On the other hand, our legal counsel is requested to study whether it is appropriate for the vehicle committee to issue certificates and forcibly require license application based on unverified certificates. Voices are hoarse with urgency and extremely激昂. If the vehicle committee insists on its own way and unfortunately causes an accident that affects public order, who will be responsible?</p>
<h3>Hiring Famous Lawyers to Request Postponement</h3>
<p>The association specially hired legal counsels Wu Kaisheng, Chen Tingrui, Gu Wo, and other lawyers to consult, and decided to first have lawyer Gu Wo send a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council, requesting postponement of the implementation of the Shanghai Municipal Council's new rickshaw regulations for February, so that both parties can calmly prepare and implement the new regulations, and avoid unfortunate incidents due to time and procedure issues. The issuance of certificates by the vehicle committee under the new regulations should be done with caution. The original owners, that is, the charitable donors or the rickshaw owners' association, should be notified in advance to ensure accuracy, and the names of the true vehicle owners should be published in the newspaper to avoid omissions and ensure transparency, which is necessary to maintain the rickshaw industry and social order.</p>
<h3>Silk Industry Bank Academic Lecture - Invitation to Mr. Luo Xiaoyong for a Lecture</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Industry Bank on Sanma Road, Shilu, has always held academic lectures, inviting experts to the bank to give lectures. It is heard that the bank is scheduled to hold a lecture at 1:00 PM on July 22nd in the board meeting room on the second floor, inviting Mr. Luo Xiaoyong, the head of the foreign exchange department of the Bank of China, to give a lecture. The topic is "The Relationship between International Exchange Banks and Importers and Exporters." Mr. Luo holds a Master's degree in Economics from Columbia University in New York and is currently also a professor of international exchange at the Business School of Hujiang University. He has both rich knowledge and experience, and it is certain that he will be able to provide a detailed and clear explanation of the meaning of international exchange at that time. It is heard that the bank welcomes people from all walks of life to participate in the lecture, but as the seats are limited, they must obtain a lecture ticket from the general affairs office of the bank in advance.</p>
<h3>A Collection of News from the Hu She (Lake Society)</h3>
<p>A Request to Relieve Drought</p>
<p>Due to prolonged drought, rivers have dried up. In the four townships of the Lake region, the rice seedlings in the farmland have all withered, and disaster has struck. The local Hu She (Lake Society) has received letters from Zhao Cichen, an executive committee member of the society, and Wen Fengli, a member of the society, requesting assistance. It is heard that the society wired the Zhejiang Provincial Government on the 14th, requesting the opening of the Jiangzha sluice gate to divert water downstream for irrigation, and dispatched technical specialists to work, save farmland, and protect the lives of the people.</p>
<p>Benefiting the Children of the Lake Region</p>
<p>The Huzhou Middle and Primary School in Shanghai, sponsored by the Hu She, has been thriving and achieving remarkable results since Mr. Yan Junxuan took over as principal. Now, in order to give preferential treatment to the children of the Lake Region coming to Shanghai to study, the school has specifically written to the Hu She to forward a letter to the education bureaus of the six counties of the Lake Region. Students from these counties who have graduated from junior or senior primary school and intend to study in Shanghai can be recommended by their respective bureaus to enter the school and will be given preferential treatment.</p>
<p>Adding Free School Places</p>
<p>The Shibai Public School at the North Railway Station in this city was founded by Mr. Tang Boqi and has a long history and considerable achievements. Since its establishment, numerous talents have emerged. During the January 28th Incident, the middle school department was destroyed by gunfire. Later, Mr. Tang made great efforts to restore the school, and the building was completely renovated and restored to its original appearance. Now, in order to benefit poor children from the Lake Region and allow them to receive secondary education, the middle school department of the school has specifically established ten free school places from this semester, which can be recommended by the society. It is heard that the society has sent letters to the education bureaus of the six counties of the Lake Region and local offices for consideration.</p>
<p>Telephone Switchboard Upgraded</p>
<p>The Hu She telephone previously only had installations in the lobby and on the second floor. As the society's affairs are developing rapidly, the society felt that the phone service did not meet current demands, and has now upgraded to a switchboard with five extensions. The switchboard numbers are 95613 and 95614. The extension numbers are as follows: 1 for the Traditional Chinese Medicine room, 2 for the club, 3 for the second-floor corridor, 4 for the hall, and 5 for the office of the Secretary-General.</p>
<h3>Yousheng Group Reschedules Trip to North China</h3>
<p>The Yousheng Travel Group, located at the corner of Niuzhuang Road and Laohe Road, organized trips to North China and Northwest China a few years ago, which were enthusiastically attended. Now, at the request of a majority of the group members, it is scheduled to organize a trip to North China again this autumn, with planned destinations including Beijing, Tangshan, the Ming Tombs, Nankou, the Great Wall at Badaling, Zhangjiakou, Datong, the Northern Sacred Mountain, Huyuan, and Baotou. The quota is set at 60 people for a period of about three weeks. Everything is currently being prepared. It is heard that the tour leader will still be Shen Xingchu.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Wuxi Tourist Special Train Service Suspended</h3>
<p>Since late April of this year, the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau has been operating a Sunday tourist special train service between the Shanghai North Station and Wuxi, which has been convenient for tourists. According to reliable information, the bureau has decided to suspend the service starting from July 22nd (Sunday) due to the hot weather and a decrease in the number of tourists.</p>
<h3>Zhabei - Public Buses Equipped with Fire Extinguishers</h3>
<p>There has been no rain for a long time, and the weather is extremely hot and humid. Fires often break out due to sunlight, especially those involving gasoline. Therefore, newspaper reports have frequently covered automobile fires on the roads recently. In order to ensure the safety of passengers, the Zhabei Chinese Public Bus Company has purchased a large number of fire extinguishers from the Ping An Factory in Heji Lane, North Zhejiang Road, and installed them on the buses. It is heard that the Yiyong brand fire extinguisher from the Ping An Factory is inexpensive, of good quality, and indeed the only effective tool for firefighting. Other public bus companies and long-distance bus companies in various provinces have also been purchasing them in large quantities from the factory recently.</p>
<h3>Continued Trial of the Case of Two Cars Colliding, Resulting in Three Deaths - Two Drivers Detained Pending Sentencing</h3>
<p>On the morning of the 13th of this month, at 7:50 AM, public bus number 15133 on Route 2 and freight truck number 16442 of the Jiaxing Road Huifang Company, collided near the intersection of Haining Road and Zhaopu Road, near Parker Lane, due to taking the wrong route. The public bus driver, Wu Jintang from Jiangbei, swerved to the right to avoid the truck, knocking down Ms. Cao He, a Cantonese woman, her 7-year-old son Yonghong, and her 4-year-old daughter Aikuan, who were sitting in a rickshaw. They suffered severe head and abdominal injuries. Another woman sitting in another vehicle was also knocked down at the same time, and the rickshaw puller, Shen Pugen from Tianjin, was injured in the legs. The Hongkou patrolman Wang Runhe, badge number 2283, arrived at the scene after being notified and transported the injured to Shanghai Sanatorium and Tongren Hospitals. The truck drivers Wu Jintang and Yang Kaimo were arrested and detained in the patrol room. The next morning, they were sent to the First Special District Court. At that time, the boy Cao Yonghong and the girl Aikuan died of their injuries in the sanatorium and hospital. Their bodies were transported to the Feilun Road morgue for examination. The two defendants were ordered to be remanded in custody. The commissioner and prosecutor of the court arrived at the morgue for examination. Details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Zehan presided over the third criminal court for investigation. The Shanghai Municipal Council lawyer Li Zhishan claimed that after investigation, the woman in the other rickshaw at the time of the accident was Zhu Chen, 44 years old, from Ningbo, and lived at No. 126 Qingji Lane, Xinji Road, Zhabei. She was initially treated at the sanatorium and hospital, but she voluntarily returned home the next day. Unexpectedly, she died of serious injuries at about 10 AM on the 16th. The area is under the jurisdiction of the Fifth District, Third Precinct. It was originally intended to send the body to the Feilun Road morgue for examination, but her family requested an exemption from the examination and had already prepared a coffin. The truck driver Yang Kaimo, the first defendant, was driving very fast from east to west and took the wrong route, causing the accident with the public bus driver, the second defendant Wu Jintang, when the two vehicles tried to avoid each other. He is now being prosecuted under Article 291, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code for negligent injury resulting in death and is asked to be severely punished. The victim Cao He is still being treated in the hospital and is unable to testify in court. Rickshaw puller Zhao Baocheng said that at the time, he was pulling a woman and two children and was traveling west when a public bus suddenly came towards them without honking its horn. In an instant, the front of the bus swerved south and knocked down his rickshaw. The testimony of rickshaw puller Shen Pugen, who had recovered, was also consistent. Cao Ziran, a Cantonese, reported that the deceased boy and girl were his children and is now requesting 24,000 yuan in compensation for damages and support from the two automobile companies. The court instructed him to file a separate civil lawsuit. When the defendants were questioned, they blamed each other. Wu Jintang hired lawyer Fan Gang to represent him. Judge Wu ruled that both defendants Yang and Wu should remain in custody pending sentencing.</p>

<h3>Incoming Correspondence: The Three Major Missions of Railway Transport</h3>
<p>(A reception held by this bureau for various industries on July 16th, Year 23)</p>
<p>—Vice Director Wu’s address on behalf of Director Yu of the Business Department of the Ministry of Railways—</p>
<p>Today, this bureau is hosting representatives from various commercial sectors. I have been entrusted by Director Yu of the Business Department of the Ministry of Railways to deliver this address on his behalf.</p>
<p>In my opinion, since Director Yu took office two years ago, he has been wholeheartedly and diligently implementing Minister Gu’s directives regarding railway transport operations, with the hope of gradually realizing three key aspects: (1) Responsible Transport; (2) Integrated Transport; (3) Effective Transport.</p>
<p>(1) The Meaning and Facilities of Responsible Transport: In the past, the railway’s role in freight transport was, frankly speaking, merely the movement of goods using vehicles. Beyond this, nothing else was considered. How could merchants be satisfied? Director Yu recognized this and believed that for railways to gain the trust of merchants and develop their business, it was essential to implement responsible freight transport. By "responsible," we mean not only moving the goods but also being responsible for their safekeeping and compensating for any losses, ensuring that merchants need not worry after entrusting their goods to the railway. The process of its past implementation is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(A) From September 1st, Year 21, the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways began implementing responsible freight transport at major stations according to plan. By November 1st, it was fully implemented at all stations along the lines.</p>
<p>(B) From September 1st, Year 21, the Tianjin-Pukou Railway first implemented responsible freight transport on the Pukou-Xuzhou section. By November 1st, it was fully implemented at all stations along the line.</p>
<p>(C) From January 1st, Year 21, the Beijing-Hankou Railway initially selected fifteen major stations to implement responsible freight transport. On November 16th, responsible transport of less-than-carload freight was implemented at all stations along the line. In January of Year 23, full-carload freight was also included.</p>
<p>(D) From October 20th, Year 21, the Nanxun Railway implemented responsible freight transport throughout the line.</p>
<p>(E) From December 1st, Year 21, the Longhai Railway began implementing responsible freight transport at major stations, and soon after, it was implemented throughout the line.</p>
<p>(F) The Beining Railway initially selected major stations in Year 19 to implement responsible freight transport. By September 1st, Year 21, it was fully implemented on all sections within the customs.</p>
<p>(G) The Jiaoji Railway began responsible freight transport during the German administration. After China regained control, this practice continued. Subsequently, it was thoroughly implemented according to the Ministry’s plan.</p>
<p>(H) From June 1st, Year 23, the Ping绥 Railway uniformly implemented responsible transport of full-carload freight at all stations along the line.</p>
<p>This is a brief historical overview of the implementation of responsible freight transport. Moreover, in the near future, freight insurance will also be introduced. This means that the original provision that railways would not compensate for accidental losses to transported goods, such as fire damage, will be changed, and compensation will be paid according to the value of the goods after insurance is implemented. Not only for freight, but also for passenger insurance. Recently, all lines were instructed to implement responsible transport of sixth-class goods. The aim is to achieve complete and thorough responsibility.</p>
<p>(2) The Meaning and Facilities of Integrated Transport: Implementing responsible transport is, in reality, only fulfilling a portion of the railway's mission. In the past, railways only transported passengers and goods from one station to another, disregarding everything else. As a result, vehicles from one line did not run on another, and the schedules of one line did not connect with those of another. Furthermore, the originating station did not inquire about how passengers and goods were delivered, and the destination station did not inquire about how they were transferred to various destinations. How could merchants be satisfied with this situation? Director Yu recognized this and believed that railway transport should be integrated, not fragmented. Therefore, the following facilities were established:</p>
<p>(A) Organizing national railway responsible intermodal transport. The process is as follows:</p>
<p>From October 1st, Year 21, the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways and the Tianjin-Pukou Railway began responsible intermodal transport of freight, initially for full-carload freight. From December 1st, responsible intermodal transport of less-than-carload freight was also implemented, without restrictions on the types of goods.</p>
<p>From July 1st, Year 22, the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways and the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway began responsible intermodal transport of freight.</p>
<p>From November 1st, Year 23, all lines nationwide uniformly implemented responsible intermodal transport of freight, initially selecting major stations, and gradually expanding thereafter. It is now fully implemented. (However, the Ping绥 Railway began implementing responsible intermodal transport of freight at sixteen selected stations from June 20th, Year 23.)</p>
<p>(B) Formulating a method for progressively reducing freight rates for intermodal transport over longer distances.</p>
<p>(C) Implementing the sale of combined passenger tickets and the transfer of vehicles between rail lines.</p>
<p>(D) Holding a national railway timetable conference to determine how to connect train schedules at various stations. This has already been implemented.</p>
<p>(E) Collaborating with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to provide combined water-land transport, allowing passengers and goods to travel by land first and then by water, or vice versa, reducing many procedures and saving time.</p>
<p>(F) Implementing a method for collecting freight charges upon arrival, allowing merchants to settle and pay fees after the goods have reached their destination.</p>
<p>(G) Implementing a freight collateralization method to provide merchants with access to working capital.</p>
<p>(H) Promulgating regulations for loading and unloading goods to provide full convenience and economy in the loading and unloading of goods.</p>
<p>The various facilities above aim to achieve the concept of "integrated transport." The intention is that the railway should not only be responsible for transporting passengers and goods from one station to another but also consider the origin and destination of the passengers and goods. In other words, the aim is to find ways to transport passengers and goods from their point of origin to their destination smoothly and quickly. Currently, various lines are handling the pickup and delivery of goods and passengers at major stations, all based on this concept. In the future, as it becomes more widespread, the mission of "integrated transport" can be completed.</p>
<p>(3) The Meaning and Facilities of Effective Transport: Effective transport refers to freight transport. The railway cannot simply transport goods from one place to another and consider its duty fulfilled. The railway has a service to provide, and it should strive to increase the utility or value of goods during transport, which would be considered fulfilling its duty and providing effective transport. According to economics, various commodities generally have four types of utility: (1) Place utility, where an item has low value in a place of surplus but increases in value when transported to a place of scarcity. (2) Time utility, where an item has low value when there is a surplus in the market but increases in value when the market is in short supply after some time. (3) Form utility, where raw materials like cotton have lower value compared to finished products like cloth (dependent on market changes). (4) Possession utility, where an item has lower value in the hands of the producer but higher value in the hands of the seller, as is often the case with various fruits. The railway, as a transporter, is deeply related to these four types of utility. It can be said that good transport can manifest all four types of utility, while poor transport may bury them all. The effectiveness of railway transport depends on whether it can help goods exhibit these four types of utility. Director Yu recognized this, so:</p>
<p>(A) Organizing long-distance responsible intermodal transport aims to maximize the expression of place utility for goods.</p>
<p>(B) Planning to establish refrigerated transport and permanent storage warehouses aims to prevent spoilage of perishable goods and allow goods suitable for quick sale to be sold when prices are favorable, thereby fully expressing their time utility.</p>
<p>As for form utility and possession utility, the railway can only fulfill a portion of its responsibility as a transporter because it cannot know who needs raw materials or semi-finished products, nor can it know who wants to sell or who wants to buy. The work of regulating this falls on the shoulders of various merchants and the banking sector, who must actively address it. The railway is of course willing to cooperate with producers and sellers to complete the mission of regulating the supply and demand of all goods.</p>
<p>Over the past year, the Ministry of Railways has held three national railway exhibitions of goods produced along railway lines in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Beiping to inform the public about what goods are produced in which locations, what goods are lacking in which locations, what the prices of various domestic products are, and what the status of their transportation and sales is. This is a prelude to promoting cooperation among production, transportation, and sales. Recently, the Ministry of Railways has further instructed all lines to establish domestic goods sales outlets at various stations, which serves the same purpose and is worth special mention.</p>
<p>The facilities of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways over the past year and a half have all been implemented based on the three goals of "responsible transport," "integrated transport," and "effective transport" championed by Director Yu. The facts are evident, so I need not elaborate. I am taking this opportunity today to express Director Yu's intentions, so that all representatives can thoroughly understand the meaning of the railway's service to the people and the efforts that the two lines are making based on this meaning. The only hope is that various merchants, acting in their respective positions as producers, sellers, or those who assist producers and sellers, will sincerely and fully cooperate with the railway, which is in the position of transporter, to integrate production, transportation, and sales, and to bring Director Yu's proposed "responsible transport," "integrated transport," and "effective transport" to the most thorough and satisfactory level, thereby contributing to the increase of national wealth and the development of people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3>About "Literary Overview" - Answer to Zhou Yun Jun -</h3>
<p>Reading Guidance:</p>
<p>Since receiving your earnest instructions from the first correspondence, I have gradually learned the theory, although time is so limited and books are so bitter: but after my uninterrupted and detailed reading, I have become accustomed to it. Now I feel the emptiness some overviews give me, the haziness some overviews give me, and the fear that some theories give me. For example, Mr. Pan Zinian's "Literary Overview" first told me that "literature uses words as a form to express the pure emotions of the stream of life." And also said: "......to give people a kind of constant balanced jump." "It is also not to be considered a literary work if it is only well expressed." "Literature is a person who expresses the injustice of the environment that he perceives, and this expression can move people." And then said: "A true literary work must reflect the characteristics of a certain era." "The greatness of a literary artist lies in his conscious or unconscious absorption of the intellectual trends of the times." "A work that does not show the humor of one's own personality, except for reporting some facts, cannot be considered a literary work." "Drama, novels, they must be full of poetic meaning to be considered literature." "Literature is the soul of history." "Literature is the vanguard of the times." "The three conditions of literature..." "Emotions that are valuable...[] worldview, social view,"; In terms of expression, it also said: "Classicalism [] Romanticism" "Naturalism" "Neo-Romanticism" "Realism" "Symbolism" "[......][......]". Furthermore, like some that make me afraid, he opened many books on "philosophy" "natural science" "social science" and so on, and told me to read them all. Indeed, erudition can lead to correct concepts, and with correct concepts, valuable and correct works can be produced. However, this is of course not a problem for people with money, but what about people like us who have limited time and money? I'm afraid I won't be able to finish reading them in a lifetime! Even if I finish reading them in a lifetime, I will only be a scholar and bookworm for a lifetime! Did the world-renowned revolutionary writer Gorky have such a process? In short, I am writing this letter with the following intentions: I don't want to be a scholar or a bookworm, I just need to have some correct basic knowledge of literature, so that I won't lag behind in creation, and where is that correct and systematic book? From your perspective, how far am I from the basic level? Literature is not as easy as the average "casual play", is it as difficult as scholars expect people to say? ......</p>

<h3>The Tragic State of Education in the Northeast Under Japanese Control</h3>
<p>▲ Urban Cities Mostly Stagnant ▲ Actively Enslaving Along Railway Lines (Dispatch from Changchun, Northeast) After the fall of the Northeast, the Japanese have been plotting to destroy the schools originally established by us, in order to eliminate nationalistic thought and carry out a poisonous plan to conquer hearts. Therefore, schools with outstanding achievements have mostly been forced to close. Those that can continue to operate or are newly established all contain special enslaving effects. Observing their recent actions towards the children of railway employees along the Northeast railways, they, in the name of the Puppet Railway Bureau, have ordered the active suppression of teaching materials with nationalistic consciousness and the elimination of revolutionary doctrines in existing schools in each railway section before the start of this semester. New enslaving schools are also being established along railway lines that have not yet established schools, in an attempt to deceive the ignorant employees of each railway into feeling "grateful" for the cultivation of their children, and to achieve the effect of forgetting their ancestors. The abnormal development of this kind of enslaving education in transportation, and the maliciousness of its design, are self-evident. As for the urban cities, our side has few accurate statistics. According to a recent survey report on the puppet regime's educational administrators to the Japanese, we can see a glimpse of the tragic decline of our original education. The survey statistics are recorded on the left. Province - Total Number of Various Schools - Number of Schools Open - Number of Schools Not Open Liaoning Province 10,350 - 6,885 - 3,465 Jilin Province 1,286 - 449 - 837 Heilongjiang Province 600 - 432 - 169 "Xingan Province" 44 - 44 - 0 Harbin 152 - 143 - 9 Jehol Province 878 - 5 - 873</p>
<h3>The Third International Education Conference Opens in Geneva</h3>
<p>(Havas Agency, Geneva, 18th) The Third International Education Conference held two meetings yesterday, at 9:30 AM and 3:00 PM respectively, both chaired by Mr. Niness. During the morning meeting, representatives from various countries successively presented the various educational facilities in their respective countries during the past academic year. Regarding China, Mr. Tang Liyuan (transliteration), the Chinese representative, made a presentation. Finally, the meeting passed a resolution on item two of the agenda, regarding "compulsory education and its extension of years".</p>
<h3>Key Points for Improvement in Colleges and Above Issued by the Ministry of Education (Ⅲ)</h3>
<p>▲ National Tsinghua University in Beiping</p>
<p>The selection and recruitment of teachers at the school is still strict, and most are full-time. They are able to work hard in teaching and research. Teacher absenteeism and student absences are relatively few, especially the physics, chemistry, biology, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering departments, where professors have no absences throughout the year, and the students in the Colleges of Science and Engineering average less than two or three hours of absence per semester, which is the most commendable. The staff work diligently, all facilities are on track, and the allocation of funds is focused on enriching equipment. All these achievements are truly commendable. However, if the following points are noted for improvement, they will be more perfect.</p>
<p>(1) The school's office expenses and number of staff are still too high. The number of staff should be reduced appropriately, and the wasted expenses should be saved and used for proper equipment. (2) The school's graduate school has too many departments. It should consider reducing the scope on its own and submit another proposal for approval. The law department of the law school should also follow the repeated instructions and close immediately.</p>
<p>(3) Among the full-time professors at the school, there are still some who concurrently teach at other schools. It is still appropriate to add restrictions to set a good example.</p>
<p>(4) The school must find ways to hold teachers responsible for close attention and guidance to students' studies and moral education at all times, and to work together to develop a good school spirit with courage, diligence, and progress.</p>
<h3>Northeast University</h3>
<p>The school has undergone major changes in recent years, but it has been able to relocate and resume classes in a short period of time. It has made great efforts to maintain itself in a difficult environment, and has implemented strict moral education with painstaking efforts. The Ministry has carefully considered and formulated the following reorganization plan, which must be followed and implemented in order to achieve enrichment and development in special aspects.</p>
<p>(1) Reorganization of Colleges and Departments: The school's organization inherited the original scope. Now that funding and teachers are exhausted, each college and department that is borrowing from other schools should be closed after the students have finished borrowing. Other colleges and departments should also be modified appropriately, so that the remaining funds can be used to enrich equipment and hire full-time professors.</p>
<p>1.  College of Agriculture: The original classes of the agronomy, horticulture, and reclamation and animal husbandry departments have ended this year. The college should be closed immediately.</p>
<p>2.  College of Science: The biology department has ended this year, and the chemistry department can also be closed next year. The college should be closed immediately.</p>
<p>3.  Department of Railway Management: Ends next summer vacation and should be closed immediately thereafter.</p>
<p>4.  College of Education: The Department of Educational Science will not enroll students this year.</p>
<p>5.  College of Liberal Arts: The Department of Foreign Literature will not enroll students this year, but may add a Department of History and Geography and a Women's Home Economics Training Program.</p>
<p>6.  College of Law: The Departments of Political Science and Economics should be merged into the Department of Political Economics. The Department of Border Affairs should pay attention to the research of the Northeast. The Department of Law will not enroll students this year.</p>
<p>7.  College of Engineering: The Departments of Mechanical Engineering and Electrical Engineering should be merged into the Department of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering. The Department of Textile Engineering should be closed immediately after the end of the summer vacation this year. The college is tentatively set up with two departments of civil engineering and high-voltage engineering.</p>
<p>8.  When necessary, a cram school may be attached to it, limiting the number of students, and enrolling high school graduates and senior students from the Northeast for one year of study, so that they can take the entrance examination for other schools or this school.</p>
<p>(2) Restricting Enrollment: The enrollment of new students in various colleges and departments should pay attention to factual needs, school capacity, student level, and student origin, etc., and should be restricted properly. After enrollment, teaching should be serious and guidance should be practical.</p>
<p>(3) Enriching Equipment: The college's engineering laboratory equipment is mostly borrowed and should be added immediately. The libraries of the Colleges of Liberal Arts, Law, and Engineering are extremely lacking and should be added in order of importance.</p>
<p>(4) Strictly Implementing the Full-Time System for Teachers: Most of the school's professors are part-time, which greatly hinders students' studies. Their treatment should be improved immediately, and the number of teaching hours should be increased. Part-time jobs outside the school should be restricted.</p>
<p>(5) Restricting Student Subsidies: It is not necessary to give subsidies to all students in the school. The situation should be investigated and handled separately. Diligent students from the four northeastern provinces can be given subsidies appropriately. Students whose families are still well-off and students who are not from the Northeast should reduce or stop subsidies to show restrictions.</p>
<p>(6) Centralizing School Buildings: The school's buildings are located in three places, which is very inconvenient. The undergraduate courses should be concentrated in one place to facilitate management and education.</p>
<p>(7) Complying with Laws and Regulations: The school must comply with laws and regulations in the future regarding matters that should be submitted to the Ministry.</p>
<h3>Military Training Will Be Abolished Next Semester</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 18th) The training and education departments held a joint meeting on military training in schools across the country a few days ago. Due to various inconveniences in terms of climate and scientific theory, the summer training part will be abolished next semester. The two departments have issued an order to all schools to comply with.</p>
<h3>The First Batch of Military Training in This City During the Summer Vacation Has Ended</h3>
<p>▲ The Military Training Committee Sent Personnel to Inspect the Results and They Were Good ▲ The Second Batch of Schools Will Begin Next Month The first batch of summer military training in high schools and above in this city has ended, and the second batch is scheduled to begin in mid-August. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>The First Batch of Military Training Has Ended</p>
<p>The first batch of summer military training schools in this city includes a total of thirteen schools. Except for Fudan University, Nanyang Model High School, Jianguo High School, and Minli High School, which have not yet ended, the schools that have ended include Tongji University, Merchant Marine School, Law School, Private Shanghai High School, Huazhi Vocational School, Xinlu Normal School, Jingye High School, Qingxin High School, and Qingnian High School.</p>
<h3>Sending Personnel to Inspect the Results and They Were Good</h3>
<p>When the military training of each school is over, the National Military Training Committee of this city is invited to send personnel to inspect it. Mr. He Chongti, the chairman of the committee, was unable to go to each school in person due to illness, so he sent a full-time member, Wang Jingxi, to each school for inspection. The subjects were class training, platoon training, company training, fortification, shooting in the field, and internal affairs. The results were all praised as good.</p>
<h3>Students from Two Schools Camp in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>When the summer military training of each school is over, they must conduct field practice. Most of them are implemented near the school. In fact, the live ammunition shooting is carried out at the Wusong Paotai Bay by the Tongji Merchant Marine and a few schools on the school's playground. The military training students of Qingxin High School and Qingnian High School went to the Zhakou, Hangzhou, yesterday, led by the school's instructors for camping and combat training. Jiang Zhenlan and Zhao Fumin, two instructors from the military training committee, were also sent to serve as inspectors.</p>
<h3>The Second Batch of Military Training Will Begin Next Month</h3>
<p>The second batch of summer military training will be held three weeks before the start of school, starting from August 10th and August 20th. The participants include the Sino-French Institute, Jiaotong University, Jinan University, Daxia University, Guanghua University, Datong University, Dongya Sports College, Business School, Zhengfeng College, Hujiang University, Aurora Middle School, Pudong Middle School, Guanghua Middle School, Fudan Experimental Middle School, Fudan Middle School, Jinan Middle School, Nanyang High School of Commerce, Daxia Middle School, Huiling Middle School, Junyi Middle School, Qunhe Middle School, and Malun Middle School.</p>
<h3>Pre-Entrance Examination for Schools Must Be Approved by the Ministry of Education The City Will Not Hold It This Semester</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of admission to schools that have not been registered, students can still take the entrance examination first, and then take the pre-entrance examination. Shanghai News reporters asked Mr. Zhou of the City Education Bureau yesterday whether the pre-admission exam would be held this semester. According to him, the pre-admission examination for graduates of unregistered middle schools must be approved by the Ministry of Education. The Bureau is acting as an agent for this matter. Before the holiday this year, the Bureau asked the Ministry of Education whether to hold the pre-admission examination. The Ministry indicated that it would not be held this semester. The fact that universities do not accept graduates from unregistered secondary schools is stipulated by the Ministry of Education. In the past, there was a case where students were allowed to take the entrance examination first, and the Ministry of Education only recognized them after they passed the pre-entrance examination. Whether the city will hold it in the future must be approved by the Ministry of Education.</p>

<h3>Students Studying in the United States Depart on Schedule</h3>
<p>▲ The First Batch of Students is 100 ▲ Scheduled to Leave Shanghai on August 10th This year, students from our country studying in the United States were affected by the strike in the United States, which hindered the dates of the postal ships. The purchase of passenger seats and transportation for departure were also affected. It was not until now that the China Travel Service had completed the process and was allowed to leave Shanghai on the 10th of next month. Since the postal ships along the Seattle route were stopped by the strike and could not come to Shanghai, it was very difficult for travelers going to the United States from Shanghai to book cabin space. This year, there are a total of 100 students from our country studying in the United States. The China Travel Service negotiated with the American Dalaiyang Firm for cabin space. At first, there was no ship supply, but after repeated requests, Dalaiyang agreed to transfer 100 first-class cabin seats from the President Hoover ship on August 10th to accommodate our students studying in the United States, and gave special preferential treatment, reducing the first-class cabin fee to the second-class ticket price. The travel agency has already informed each student to apply for a passport to the United States and will be allowed to depart from Shanghai on August 10th.</p>

<h3>Director Pan's Speech: New Trends in Recent Education</h3>
<p>▲ Broadcasted at the China &amp; West Grand Pharmacy yesterday</p>
<p>Mr. Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, broadcasted on the radio at the China &amp; West Grand Pharmacy from 4:30 PM to 5:30 PM yesterday. The topic was "New Trends in Recent Education." The record was taken by Nie Haifan. The following is the transcript of his speech: In China, at this critical juncture when foreign invasions are frequent and the nation is struggling for its survival, every educator bears a heavy burden, especially those responsible for educational administration. Although we are not proponents of the omnipotence of education, we cannot deny that education is a major force in the national self-salvation movement. Originally, education is a means to assist human beings in managing social life – both material and spiritual. It also bears the important mission of improving society and promoting the rationalization of human life. Therefore, all educational theories, educational policies, educational plans, and their facilities must be based on this principle. Education with this function is what the people need and what is in line with the times; otherwise, it becomes a social encumbrance, at most only a social ornament. (See Productive Education and Political Education). Therefore, we must have a clear understanding of the current tasks and trends in education. Recently, the new trends in education, in terms of environmental facts and trends, are all moving towards science and production. However, tracing the reasons, it is actually influenced by Rousseau's educational thought in the 18th century. At the same time, it has been endorsed by Pestalozzi, Herbrt, Foredel, and Spencer in the 19th century. Recently, with the vigorous advocacy of Dewey, Thondike, and Cilpairsk, the trend of educational science and educational production has been created today. A brief description is given below: (1) The new trend of educational science. Since the Industrial Revolution, the enlightenment and progress of science can be said to have progressed rapidly. Its greatest effect is that it tends to focus on the interests of the masses rather than the interests of individuals, and on the interests of society rather than the interests of individuals. In education, science is applied everywhere to break the old, rigid ideas and transform them into practical and scientific meanings. The theories and methods of Rousseau, Pestalozzi, Herbrt, Foredel, Spencer, and Dewey all adopt scientific methods, so they are very advanced and welcomed by the general public. Among the sciences, those most closely related to education are biology, psychology, ethics, sociology, etc. Now, whether it is the organization of school curricula, teaching methods, research, or implementation, Maeall's educational experimentation method, Bonser and Babbilt's curriculum development, and Kilpatrick's creation and implementation of the project method of education are all clear representations of the scientificization of education. (2) The new trend of educational production. People are born into the world to seek survival. To seek survival, they must seek the nourishment for survival. Whether nourishment is obtained depends on the tools they have. In other words, people must seek food, and to seek food, they must work. Education is what gives people all the tools to work. Therefore, current education experts advocate that schools should pay attention to at least the following three points: First, emphasize the training of business spirit and interest. Second, increase business knowledge and skills. Third, promote business opportunities and equipment. Dewey, Ruskin, Horne, and White Land and others all advocated these things. At the same time, they advocated that teaching should be centered on "doing." In other words, those who study agriculture should go to the countryside, those who study engineering should go to the factory, and those who study mining should go to the mine. Do not let school education become useless aristocratic education, focusing only on words, despising labor, and neglecting practicality. This is something that should be painfully changed. In short, the progress of education is transformed with the changes in the environment. The new trends in education mentioned above refer to the teaching itself, but in terms of education policy, the democratic and liberal educational theories have become a thing of the past. Now, the educational policies of various countries are all moving towards the same path. The Soviet Union uses controlled education and the popularization of the slogans of communism, while Italy and Germany use controlled education as the basis for implementing Fascist politics. Other countries such as Britain, the United States, and France all recognize the necessity of unified national management of education. This recognition is really because the era of laissez-faire and false democracy has created national chaos, complexity, powerlessness, and incompetence, and the education that creates the fundamental national spirit should bear a major responsibility. In recent times, due to the trend of political and economic unification, educational policies have tended towards control, which is very reasonable.</p>

<h3>Chinese Club Only One Point Behind French Business Club</h3>
<p>The competition between the Chinese Tennis Club and the French Business Association in this year's league championship has become a very interesting and noteworthy center. Since the French Business Association exceeded the Chinese Tennis Club by four points, the Chinese Tennis Club has been catching up rapidly. After last week's battle, the Chinese Club won against North Grass Court by fourteen to one, while the French Business Club won against South Grass Court by thirteen to two, thus catching up by one point, only three points behind. After yesterday's battle, the Chinese Club won all against South Grass Court, while the French Business Club only won against North Grass Court by thirteen to two. Now, the Chinese Club is only one point behind the French Business Club. The current scores of each team are as follows:</p>

<h3>Championship Depends Entirely on the Next Battle</h3>
<p>This year's league is coming to a successful conclusion. Only the last game on Wednesday next week remains. The Chinese Club will face the Inland &amp; Foreign Spinning Factory, while the French Business Club will face the Japanese Club. If the Chinese Club can score two more points than the French Business Club against Japan, the Chinese Club will win the championship again. In terms of strength, it is possible for the Chinese Club to win against the Inland &amp; Foreign Spinning Factory. However, the players of the Inland &amp; Foreign Factory are soft but hard, so there is no need to be too optimistic. However, it is not easy for the French Business Club to win against the Japanese Club. Even the Chinese Club only won against them by nine to six. Therefore, based on the facts, the Chinese Club has great hopes. The schedule for the last game on Wednesday is as follows:</p>
<p>Chinese Club vs. Inland &amp; Foreign Factory At Inland &amp; Foreign Spinning Factory</p>
<p>French Business Club vs. Japanese Club At Japanese Tennis Club</p>
<p>Portugal vs. North Grass Court At Portuguese Club</p>
<p>South Grass Court vs. Xiejiao Club At Racecourse</p>
<h3>Record of Chinese Club's Complete Victory Over South Grass Court</h3>
<p>The Chinese Club must win all against South Grass Court, which was the unanimous decision of the entire team beforehand. However, the allocation of the lineup was the most difficult task. The second doubles of South Grass Court is quite strong. The French Business Club's Meyers and Bellence suffered a setback last week, so Lin Baohua and Ma Anquan were paired up, and the strength of the third and fourth groups was averaged, so Wang Wenzheng and Yu Tianguang were separated. As a result, a complete victory was achieved, but it took a lot of effort.</p>
<p>▲First Group Liang Deguang's performance was particularly satisfactory yesterday. Pairing with Lao Qiu, the victory came very easily. It was also the earliest completion of the Miss.</p>
<p>▲Second Group Lin Ma's victory was the most thrilling. The two opponents were indeed impressive. The volley kills left no way out. The first set was won after a hard fight. The opponent would take the lead with a score of 3-1 in the second set, and then became 5-3. Lin Ma would recover the decline twice when there was only one point difference in losing the set, winning three games in a row, and finally winning with a score of 7-5. It can be said to be fortunate.</p>
<p>▲Third Group From the outside, the third group is the most worrying. The opponent's Bausella is a football player from Lacrosse. He is young and strong, and he keeps hitting hard on the court. After that, his energy is exhausted, so it becomes a flash in the pan. Wang Wenzheng is steady and does not stand.</p>
<p>▲Fourth Group Xiao Yu and Tu Kaiyuan are paired, residing in the fourth group, as a number.</p>
<p>▲Fifth Group Zhou Guanjun and Zhang Dingzhao, the first set was embarrassed by the opponent. After some effort, it went smoothly, and the situation changed rapidly, winning three consecutive sets. The complete results are as follows:</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai) 6 to 2 Mai Da)</p>
<p>(1) Chinese 6 to 1 South</p>
<p>Liang Deguang (6 to 0 Smith (</p>
<p>Lin Shihua) 6 to 4 Ma Xuer)</p>
<p>(2) Chinese 7 to 5 South</p>
<p>Ma Anquan (6 to 4 Hui Aituo (</p>
<p>Wang Wenzheng) 6 to 2 Bausella)</p>
<p>(3) Chinese 6 to 1 South</p>

<h3>Thousands of Fans Watch the Draw Between Luo Fang and Jian Bei in the North Stadium</h3>
<p>▲No Winners or Losers in the First Half</p>
<p>▲Each Side Scores One Goal in the Second Half</p>
<p>The summer is hot and humid, and the stadium in western Shanghai is bustling and lively. Since 5:00 PM, fans have been dressing up, shouting, and walking here and there. The seats in the stands were already full, and thousands of people were standing around the stadium, breaking the record for the largest number of people in the friendly match in western Shanghai. This is due to the magic power of the reputation of the two teams. However, there were some changes in Luo Fang's lineup, such as Jiang Shan Jing, Xi Qiao Sheng, Zhong Yong Sen, Chen Jia Qiu, etc., who were unable to attend the battle due to various reasons, so young players were transferred to the field. There were no achievements in the first half, and each side scored one goal in the second half, resulting in a draw. The lineups of the two armies are recorded as follows: ▲Luo Fang Lineup</p>

<p>National Goods Talk</p>
<h3>Honesty First—Dedicated to Producers and Sellers of National Goods—</h3>
<p>— Jing Cun</p>
<p>It is truly heartbreaking to say that the practice of "selling dog meat as mutton" has actually occurred in the national goods industry. The same goods are more expensive than foreign goods, but the quality is worse than foreign goods. Whether it is the producers or sellers of national goods, if there is such a fact, it is not only the misfortune of the national goods industry, but also the misfortune of the nation. No matter what the reason, when comparing national goods with foreign goods in the Chinese market, whether in terms of production costs or transportation costs, the value of national goods should be cheaper than foreign goods, or at least not more expensive than foreign goods. Even if the cost of carefully selected raw materials and manufactured goods is more expensive than foreign goods, the quality must be better than foreign goods to make sense. If the quality is not as good as foreign goods, but the value is more expensive than foreign goods, this kind of counter-propaganda of the national goods movement is more powerful than anything else. The difficulty in making progress in the national goods movement in recent years may be one of the major reasons.</p>
<p>The author is confident that he sympathizes with the national goods movement. Sometimes, because he was cheated by buying national goods, he was ridiculed by his family. Cheapness is what everyone loves. Knowing that it is not cheap but willing to suffer losses is something no one wants to do. Although we are thinking about the country's economy and the people's economy, we cannot but buy national goods. However, seeing that we are cheated by dishonest national goods producers or sellers for the sake of promoting national goods, we may turn love into hatred for the national goods movement, or at least reduce the enthusiasm for promoting national goods. Isn't this practice of "selling dog meat as mutton" a suicide policy for the national goods industry?</p>
<p>I would like to advise the national goods industry with twelve points of enthusiasm, with the word "honesty", at this time when the national economy is about to go bankrupt, fortunately there is the advocacy of the national goods movement. If the national goods movement is effective, the producers and sellers of national goods will be the first to benefit. During the period of the national goods movement, the producers of national goods should not only care about the small profits in front of them, cut corners, and supply inferior products to the market: the sellers of national goods should not use the good name of promoting national goods to seek greater profits, and use inferior goods to deceive customers. Losing valuable credibility, in the national goods movement, the producers and sellers of national goods should recognize the facts rather than propaganda. If the national goods movement is to be effective, "honesty" should be the primary meaning.</p>
<p>National Goods Discussion</p>
<h3>The New Tariff and the Crisis of China's National Goods Industry</h3>
<p>— Lu Xia</p>
<p>Since China restored its tariff autonomy in the 19th year of the Republic of China, and since the expiration of the China Mutual Tariff Agreement in May of last year, the import of foreign goods has been restricted, and the national goods industry has made considerable progress. According to the annual report of the Chinese Cotton Mill Association: In terms of coarse and fine cloth alone, imports were more than 9 million yuan in the 20th year, but last year it was reduced to about 1 million yuan. As for other items, it goes without saying. It is hoped that the government will make more efforts to lay the foundation for protective tariffs, so that the domestic young industry and commerce can obtain normal development.</p>
<p>The news of the Ministry of Finance's explanation of the new tariff was published in the newspaper the day before yesterday, but even he could not justify himself. The facts are the most eloquent, let us carefully review the full text of the new tariff published in this newspaper on the 3rd of this month. What makes us most concerned is cotton and its products. In this, regarding bleached and dyed cotton cut velvet, printed plain coarse and fine cloth, soft and thin western yarn, etc., the tax is reduced by 3 cents to 1 corner and 1 cent per meter. However, the tax on cotton has been increased, which is 1.5 yuan per 100 kg. In terms of machinery, the tax is increased: agricultural machinery and accessories are increased by 3.5%, generators are increased by 7.5%, manufacturing machinery, tools, gas and gasoline engines, and sewing machines... unnamed machinery and accessories are increased by 2.5%. There are also typewriters, numbering machines, clocks, watches, telephones, telegraph machines, wireless machines... electrical appliances, etc., all of which are increased by 5%. Chemicals such as acetic acid, boric acid, and sulfuric acid are increased by 1 corner to 1 yuan. Bleaching powder is increased by 5% per 100 kg, glycerin is increased by 2 yuan and 1 cent, dyes and pigments... etc. are increased by 5 yuan, and kerosene in boxes is increased by 3 corners, and in bulk cabins is increased by 1 corner. … We don't need to list more, let the readers compare the new tariff with the old tariff to know the details. In these years, foreign and domestic troubles have not ended, and the people's purchasing power has declined. The reason why the national goods industry is so strong and has made progress in the midst of storms must be attributed to the people's patriotism and tariff autonomy. However, people are always greedy for cheap goods. Except for a small number of patriotic people, they will not always use national goods. In this way, we have to seek the development of the national goods industry itself to achieve the purpose of low price and good quality. However, to develop domestic industry, the first is to protect the domestic market and exclude foreign goods. The second is to have a large amount of capital for utilization. But what is the fact? The United States has already implemented the silver policy, which is the first step to dump goods on us (not long ago, I wrote an article in this column entitled "Roosevelt's Silver Policy and the Future of the National Goods Industry in Various Countries", please refer to it). Under such a policy, foreign goods fill the market, and silver flows out very quickly. Since our national goods industry has lost the large amount of capital that can be used and the domestic market, of course there is no hope of development. We now only have this only last weapon: tariff policy. It is obvious that the tariff policy is beneficial to the domestic industry, like that Hall Tariff: What about our country with backward industry and commerce?</p>
<h3>What is the Mission of the National Goods Inspection Team Going to the Inland?</h3>
<p>— Quan Jia</p>
<p>In the recent newspapers, we know that the gentlemen who are enthusiastic about national goods, in addition to promoting them in the cities, have indeed paid attention to the national goods business in the inland. The Northwest Mobile National Goods Exhibition, etc., its significance and mission are the greatest. But, wise gentlemen! In addition to the fact that your products can make profits, this contains a greater mission, which you may have overlooked!</p>
<p>First, the bankruptcy of the rural areas in the inland, and the people's economic power is so weak, the goods sold by the National Goods Inspection Team should be practical! On the one hand, the selling price should be reduced to increase the purchase rate. At the same time, you should investigate how their handicrafts are in a dangerous position, and you should help them as much as possible, so that the national handicrafts can get a little dawn.</p>
<p>Second, if you are prepared to invest, then you should choose those that are more beneficial to the public, and those that are needed in national goods. Otherwise, it is for the sake of profit to make unnecessary competition in the same business. I am afraid that wise gentlemen will not disdain to do it!</p>
<p>Third, you should also contact the financial institutions or social groups in the inland. The former can be used to assist in the national goods business, and the latter can be used to promote the national goods business. I think no matter how hard you work, it is necessary to communicate with these two powerful agencies that can help you!</p>
<p>Fourth, in the inland, the invasion of imperialism is very serious. You should carefully investigate how the powers are sucking up the rural economy, so that you, or the national goods workers who work hard later, have a mirror to block this dangerous hole.</p>
<p>Fifth, in addition to your promotion, you can also report the products of the inland or those that can be used to improve into a profitable national goods factory to the government, which is the best. At least, for the national finance, there will be one more income.</p>
<p>Wise gentlemen! How eagerly I am looking forward to your triumph! You are willing to practice and introduce and promote it on the ground. This spirit is the most worthy of wishing in advance. Here, I will put forward the other five tasks as a means of eliciting brilliant ideas!</p>
<h3>New News from the National Goods Industry in One Week</h3>
<p>(1) Mr. Spake, an American, has been engaged in the import business in China for a long time. Now that Chinese national goods have made rapid progress and foreigners are also happy to buy and use them, he has specially organized a company to specialize in promoting national goods. He has now collected more than 150 kinds of excellent national goods and is exhibiting them on the second floor of HSBC in this city. The goods will be packed and shipped to various ports in Nanyang, and then distributed to India, Europe and the United States for promotion.</p>
<p>(2) The International Trade Bureau believes that China's foreign trade is indirect trade, which is handled by foreign firms. It is very inconvenient. It specially introduces British and American businessmen to directly purchase our country's products in order to open up overseas markets. It is known that London needs domestic novelty goods and sorghum stalks, the United States needs soybean powder, and Siam needs electrical materials. Manufacturers can contact the Bureau.</p>
<p>(3) Mr. Wu Yun Chu, a giant in the national goods industry, went abroad on the 13th to investigate the industry in Italy, France, and Germany, and is scheduled to return to Shanghai in three months.</p>
<p>(4) The products of our country participating in the Chicago World's Fair in the United States have been shipped out in four batches, totaling more than 680 boxes. Because of the good quality and low price, they are quite popular among people in the United States. Yesterday, there was a fifth batch of more than 110 boxes shipped to the United States.</p>
<p>(5) The Shanghai Chinese National Product Manufacturers Association is preparing to form a National Product Manufacturers Travel Group to promote national goods and promote domestic products. It has drafted regulations and is soliciting the consent of various manufacturers.</p>
<p>(6) The Ministry of Industry and Commerce issued an order to national goods companies and manufacturers across the country that all products, except those sold abroad, must be marked with Chinese national goods brands.</p>
<p>(7) In order to protect the national quintessence and safeguard domestic products, the national goods groups in this city have specially requested the Executive Yuan to order all agencies and groups across the country to return and rewrite any documents that can be written with domestic pens and inks but are written with imported pens and inks. It is heard that the Executive Yuan has ordered the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Education, and Industry to draft a plan.</p>
<p>(8) The National Goods Exhibition in Zhenjiang Provincial Capital was originally scheduled to open on the 20th. Now, due to the hot weather and the congestion of railway freight, it has been postponed for five days. The manufacturers participating in this city have been packing and shipping in batches for days, and it was stopped yesterday.</p>

<h3>An Account of Visiting the Northwest National Goods Mobile Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Jue An</p>
<p>The term "Northwest" seems very fashionable and grand nowadays. Indeed, the "Northwest" was once the birthplace of Chinese culture, and now it is our lifeline. Chinese people, growing up in a situation where powerful neighbors are pressing in and struggling to survive, should pay attention to the "Northwest"! The "Northwest" is worth developing, and is being developed.</p>
<p>This time, the Shanghai Chinese National Goods Production and Sales Cooperation Association made a grand aspiration, uniting more than 20 Shanghai national goods manufacturers to organize a Northwest National Goods Mobile Exhibition Group, traveling thousands of miles to Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, and Xi'an to exhibit. This is a praiseworthy event, whether in promoting national goods or developing the Northwest.</p>
<p>Two weeks in Kaifeng, two weeks in Zhengzhou, and next is Luoyang! Since the news of the Northwest National Goods Exhibition Group was published in the newspapers, the people of Luoyang have been looking forward to its arrival. To describe it vividly, it is truly like expecting rain in a great drought. Indeed, the ancient capital, which is rather dull, needs such a grand event to liven things up and inspire people.</p>
<p>Well, the long-awaited "Northwest National Goods Exhibition Group" finally opened at the commercial center of the temporary capital! Although because of the hurried journey, there was not much grand decoration, the scale was already not small. A colorful archway was erected at the entrance, and the beautiful banner of the "Northwest National Goods Mobile Exhibition Group" fluttered in the sky. Below, like a tide, the visitors walked inside shoulder to shoulder, seemingly with a desire to be among the first to see. The reporter was of course one of them. It is said that in the morning when it was most crowded, because the weather was too hot, an elderly man in his forties died from the heat. This shows the grandeur of the scene and the enthusiasm of the people of the Northwest for promoting national goods.</p>
<p>More than twenty national goods factories were arranged on the left and right in order. On the left, the China Chemical Industry Society, China Enamel Factory, Family Industry Society, Taikang Food Company, and Sanyou Enterprise Society were the most neatly and exquisitely arranged, and their business seemed to be particularly lively. On the right, several silk and satin factories and rubber factories were more eye-catching. Among them, the table lamp of the Guanghua Gas Lamp Factory, shining brightly, stood aloof and was the most touching. In general, the elders from the countryside looked east and west, feeling that everything was good, but their money was limited. They had no choice but to choose those that were relatively cheap, buying one or two items to satisfy their desires. Therefore, silk and velvet, which required foreign money to buy, had much quieter storefronts. This may be a manifestation of rural bankruptcy! In short, after visiting the Northwest National Goods Exhibition Group this time, I felt very happy. First, China does have good national goods, and this exhibition can give the people of the Northwest a full understanding of this. Second, the Chinese people do love national goods, especially the people of the Northwest. This time, they can fully express their enthusiasm for using national goods. I think the organization of this Northwest National Goods Exhibition Group is very admirable. It is a pity that only more than twenty national goods manufacturers participated in such a large China, which feels a bit imperfect. Therefore, I hope, sincerely hope, that more such grand events will be held in the future, and that more manufacturers will participate, so that the entire China can fully embark on the road of using national goods!

<h3>The Fifth Act of the National Goods Display Competition Window</h3>
<p>— Qi Nan</p>
<p>Walking past the front of the British American Tobacco Company, a window display came into view, having changed again. Replacing the display of the Jinglun Shirt Factory, the Rendan of the Sino-French Pharmacy was attracting pedestrians to pause temporarily.</p>
<p>Window display is originally a part of commercial art. Its overall purpose is to use the stimulating power that the display possesses to give those who see it a deep impression. Because the National Goods Display Competition Window only allows each participating manufacturer to display for ten days, all participants strive to increase the stimulating power of their display in order to achieve their advertising effect.</p>
<p>This time, the Sino-French Pharmacy's display is a Cubist display. The two large characters "Ren Dan" made of golden plaster clay are Cubist in shape. The position of the character "Ren" is higher than that of the character "Dan", which can be said to be the simplest stepped arrangement. The character bellies are hollow, with light bulbs embedded in them, which emit a deep red light at night. Behind the characters is a red-edged black background board, which makes the two characters "Ren Dan" appear more precious. The value of the medicine itself is fully expressed here, which is the highest point of stimulation in their display. The only pity is that there is one less layer of silver-gray background behind the lining board, which makes the light a little too dim.</p>
<p>White satin was spread on the floor of the window, on which packaged boxes of Rendan were placed, which was still quite eye-catching.</p>
<p>Looking at the entire window display, because the main body is concentrated, the stimulation is also very great. The window decoration of the Maishi Gan next to it uses mural-style advertisements to set off the main body of the display. The two companies are competing with each other and are very ingenious. Those who are concerned about commercial art may wish to go and watch.</p>
<h3>Short News</h3>
<p>The Shanghai rubber industry mostly produces rain boots. The output has recently been affected by the dumping of foreign goods, and closures have been heard from time to time. Now, Cai Chunfang, a senior member of the rubber industry, is seeking a way to provide relief and has initiated the establishment of the Qianfeng Industrial Manufacturing Factory on Hengye Road in Zhabei. The factory uses rubber raw materials to manufacture various practical goods. The factory is quite large in scale, has strong capital, and its machines are all the latest models. Mr. Cai is the former Deputy Director of the Jiangwan Model Factory and is currently a consultant to the Shanghai Rubber Industry Association. He has rich experience in the rubber industry. It is reported that the factory's machines have been fully arranged and will be put into operation soon. It is said that the factory has newly invented a kind of rubber candy, which is the most distinctive feature. It uses rubber raw materials mixed into chewing gum and is the first of its kind in China. It is thought that this will open up a new path for the rubber industry in the future.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Speaking and Silence</h3>
<p>— Guan</p>
<p>Laozi seems to dislike speaking the most, but he also wrote five thousand words by pulling this and dragging that. Writing several volumes, specifically discussing the benefits of silence, the world should also laugh at his false claims. Therefore, saying a few simple sentences is closer to the truth. Those who know do not speak, and the wonderful Tao is hidden in the belly, making people unpredictable and also making people suspect that it is actually nothing; but no one understands the mystery more than Laozi, yet he still has five thousand words, so using this standard to speculate about ordinary people, the reason for their silence may be more mysterious and profound than Laozi, or they may know nothing at all, just like a foreigner who does not understand Chinese and naturally has nothing to say.</p>
<p>One who has seen much of the world and has wide knowledge and what he holds is vast, must reach a state where he feels that there is nothing to say. There are two meanings to having nothing to say: one is that there are things that cannot be said, like being in Turkey; the other is that there are things that one does not want to say, which is a purely psychological effect. This contains multiple meanings, which I do not want to say here. The former is objective, and the latter is subjective.</p>
<p>Talking about principles to the extreme, one cannot say that it is false, and one cannot say that it is true,</p>
<p>until language is cut off and the mind's thoughts are exhausted, this opens up another realm, which the Buddha calls inconceivable and also returns to the path of silence.</p>
<p>Looking back at those who speak today, some ascend the podium and speak endlessly, with mouths like suspended rivers; others write furiously, immediately filling up several squares. Examining closely, what are they saying? Generally, it can be summarized in four characters: "I don't know what I'm talking about."</p>
<p>Not knowing what one is talking about also has two meanings: not being clear about what one is saying and not understanding it oneself, just saying it all and finishing, is one type. Or speaking hastily without choosing words, pouring out incoherently, which is a state in literature, expressing infinite sadness or infinite joy, is also a type. Most modern people can neither know nor speak. If they speak, they don't know what they are talking about, creating a great depressing situation, as if forever separated from wisdom and truth.</p>
<h3>Hot in Nanjing (2)</h3>
<p>— Shu Shan</p>
<p>Is it really that the Buddha's Dharma has no power? Or perhaps heaven is not tired of excess, and people are destined to suffer this catastrophe, it may not be known, I think.</p>
<p>Hot, hot, everywhere one hears this cry.</p>
<p>The old woman in the steaming kitchen cries hot, and I also cry hot when I pick up the bowl; the rickshaw puller runs under the scorching sun and cries hot, and I also cry hot sitting in the rickshaw; sometimes I go to people's tall buildings, open my clothes, face the electric fan, open my mouth, eating watermelon or ice cream, etc., and everyone still responds with the words hot, hot. Ah, endless and rich, without rest, without pause, a chorus of cries of hot, and what wonder that the tongue of the yellow dog, too lazy even to eat feces, often sticks out of its mouth? Among the more than 700,000 citizens of Nanjing, we have not seen statistics on how many have become sick and died from heatstroke, but the death rate has increased sharply in the past half month, said to be higher than usual, which is likely to be a fact. It is also said that a rickshaw puller was pulling someone to Drum Tower when, just after putting the rickshaw down, before getting the money, he suddenly fell down and did not get up. Speaking of this, it really makes people feel contradictory and embarrassed: if you say they are pitiful and don't ride in their rickshaws, then what will they eat? If you ride in their rickshaws as usual for the sake of their livelihood, then how can your conscience bear it? I don't know where those philanthropists have gone to escape the heat, without making some plans for this problem sooner. I think that in this hot summer, they should at least give more money and not tell them to run fast! As for why the rickshaw pullers are desperately pulling the rickshaws? It is nothing more than for money, for life, but unfortunately, they die because of it. This is again to awaken the illusions of people who are mixed up in another kind of "dying for wealth."</p>
<p>At this moment, no matter how bankrupt the countryside is or how sluggish the market is, the watermelon and ice businesses are making three times the profit.</p>
<p>Swimming is currently being vigorously promoted everywhere, and the city of Nanjing cannot be an exception. It is said that the Nanjing Summer Swimming Competition Association is already in preparation and has decided to invite the mermaid Yang Xiuqiong to perform in Nanjing on her way home after she arrives in Nanchang. As a result, many young men and women have been going to the Central Swimming Pool outside Zhongshan Gate, the Amateur Sports Association Swimming Pool in Xinjiekou, and the now-abandoned Jiulong Bridge Swimming Pool outside Tongji Gate to practice swimming in order to escape the summer heat. It is only strange that the Jiulong Bridge Swimming Pool, since its opening in the 20th year of the Republic of China, has averaged about ten drowning swimmers every summer, and although the equipment was dismantled early this year and swimming was prohibited, those who are crazy about swimming still disregarded everything and flocked to it, so that three people have already tragically drowned to death; could there really be ghosts there? As for Guo Dafu and others chasing after the Shi brothers and swimming across the Yangtze River, that can only be said to be a special case. Also, the Qin Huai singers Wang Xichun and Gu Aizhen, both actually wanted to consider themselves noble and used fake certificates to go to the amateur swimming pool, which was eventually discovered, suspected of corruption, and for the sake of public hygiene. A major negotiation took place, and in the end they slipped away, and the inspectors suffered a great disappointment.</p>
<p>People who have access to public or private cars feel that electric fans, watermelons, and ice cream are not enough to dispel their boredom and heat, and they must drive out for a spin. For the sake of driving, they must open the throttle to the maximum, so that those of us who are used to walking on the road have to be extra careful and must eat twice as much dust.</p>
<p>Some people who have money and leisure have already flown away to various places to escape the heat. Most of the male and female students in various schools have also gone home for vacation, jumping out of this steamer-like city and going to the countryside to cool off. As for the few among them who have no home to return to, they still live in the school and, like us who have no leisure and no money to go out of town to escape the heat, simply walk to various cool places in the evening to have tea and take a walk. Speaking of places to have tea and take a walk, in this large city of Nanjing, even if you force yourself to count, there are only a few places: First Park, Drum Tower Park, Qinhuai River and Qinhuai Small Park, Xuanwu Lake and Five Continents Park, Mochou Lake, Bailuzhou, Beijige, Qingliang Mountain, Wutai Mountain, Yuhuatai, Linggu Temple and the area around the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, and the Jiangsu Provincial People's Education Center.</p>
<p>To explain further, although places like Linggu Temple and Yuhuatai all have mountains and water, excellent scenery, dense shade, coolness, and pleasantness, because they are all outside the city and the journey is far, it is not easy for people without cars to travel back and forth. Although Drum Tower Park is very suitable for people in the city to play, because its area is very small and there is no tea to drink, it is only suitable for sitting for a while after dusk. As for places like Bailuzhou, Beijige, Qingliang Mountain, and Wutai Mountain, they are mostly remote and desolate, with deep grass and winding paths. Even if there are no jackals blocking the road, or even people eating people in broad daylight behind the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum, snakes and vipers are everywhere, readily poisonous, which is enough to make people somewhat wary. For example, a few days ago, someone walking near Sanpailou at night was bitten and killed by a snake more than ten feet long; also, Zhongda students Deng and Wang went to Beijige at night to cool off and were almost scared to death by a green snake. There is also the Jinling University nurse Xu Huijuan, who was murdered while walking on a secluded path at night, which is still an unsolved case. Because of these kinds of things, after sunset, you can only see the tourists leaving in droves by appointment. As for the People's Education Center on the banks of the Qinhuai River, it used to be Tao Yuan's old site, with flowers and plants to admire and tea and snacks to eat, but because it is a people's education center, not a public recreation place, not many people go there to cool off. Also, the Jian Yuan and Lan Yuan on the opposite bank all had lush green bamboos and tea houses a few years ago, but now it is unknown where they have gone. Among the private gardens, the Fool's Garden, that is, the Hu Family Garden, has always been the most famous. I remember that in the 17th year of the Republic of China, I liked to go there with Man and others to cool off or enjoy the moon, but later it was increasingly destroyed and unbearable, so we have not been there since.</p>
<h3>Lulu</h3>
<p>— Pu Feng</p>
<p>With a bit of shyness and tears, Lulu, I know that you didn't want to learn to dance at first. But poverty determined your fate, and how could your parents let you be spoiled at home? Putting on those red and green damask silks, I understand the countless sorrows hidden in your smile; going out at night and dragging back your heavy body at dawn, in the messy footsteps I am familiar with the tears in your heart. Alas! If the war hadn't made your mother leave the garden desolate, Lulu, hoeing and carrying a rake might have been your forte. But the soldiers actually drove you to the city, the city, with an unemployed father, wouldn't you be regarded as a money tree? Oh! Poor Lulu! Will the red and blue lights slowly erode your entire youth from now on? One day, you will fall down in the melodious jazz music, wait, sooner or later you will only have anemia left!</p>
<h3>The Literary Games of Old Literati</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>The Shanghai Literary Society sent out nearly two hundred letters soliciting domestic writers to describe the connection between themselves and literature. A total of fifty-nine people were published in "Me and Literature." Of these fifty-three people, not one said that they embarked on the path of literature through the inspiration of ancient Tang and Song prose or the Zhuangzi Anthology. Most of them were led to the path of literature by Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio, and Journey to the West. What is even stranger is that not a single writer came from a university liberal arts background. These writers, at least their writing, can be listed above the baseline, and have almost no contact with the old shop of "Confucius said poetry." Isn't this clearly declaring the complete bankruptcy of "Confucius said poetry?" Someone raised an objection, wanting to invite these fifty-nine writers to be literary attendants; or some important person's fiftieth birthday is coming up, wanting a birthday couplet and a birthday article; or some senior official has died of old age, wanting a eulogy and an epitaph; or some general is preparing to retire, wanting a declaration and a circular telegram. Then the fifty-nine writers all put down their pens, scratching their heads and asking the heavens, and they have to let the old secretary who holds the water pipe shake his head and chant. Clearly, there are two major roads in front of us: one is the road to literary creation, honestly using language and words to express one's own emotions and will, and being intimate to have taste. The other is the road to literary attendants, wanting to speak for the superiors, not allowing even a little bit of one's own subjectivity, and using obscurity as a technique. The former develops talent, and the latter develops slaves; the former expresses the self with words and language, and the latter uses concepts and words as games; the former regards Qu Yuan's Lisao as the greatest writer and greatest work of ancient and modern times, and the latter believes that it is "too narrow-minded to be a lesson" (see Zizhi Tongjian). Their viewpoints are different, and their basic training is different, so on the one hand, they see that the younger generation is not enough to inherit the great cause of slaves, and they sigh that they cannot return to literary Chinese; on the other hand, they believe that the old cherry tree should be cut down, and the old man's crying is not as good as the young man's laughter (Chekhov's Cherry Orchard). This chasm can never be filled.</p>
<p>Now let's see how old literati practice word games and how they use word games. Since the old literati are in a position of slaves, writing for their masters, or the masters have unspeakable secrets, or the masters want to call a deer a horse to scold someone, the principle of "sincerity in rhetoric" is naturally unnecessary, so they have to take another path, vaguely, seeming to walk but not walking, acting in a mysterious cloak; like a magic trick, clearly fake, but they must be quick-eyed and quick-handed, and act very realistically. The apprentices of magicians first learn some small tricks such as changing money three times and taking rice from the air; the old literati also first learn some small word games such as guessing riddles, matching words, and breaking the topic, and then spread them out. In the past, people who entered private schools to study and write had to learn to break the topic; breaking the topic is most similar to making lantern riddles. The text of the Four Books is like the answer to the riddle, and a riddle is made according to the answer to the riddle. A good riddle text just hides the answer to the riddle. Once the topic is broken, it is elaborated according to the breaking of the topic, which is called "breaking the topic is done by the art of the mouth, the article is up to me; since I have broken the topic, I am up to the article." It is said that there was a child student who was more than seventy years old and sought to take the exam. Wen Zong used "Grown up without recounting anything, old without dying" as the topic and ordered him to break the topic. The child student immediately replied: "If you don't get the name, you must get the longevity." Wen Zong was surprised by it and was admitted to the school. From a technical point of view, this breaking of the topic is well done; an irrelevant topic is actually made reasonable and fits his own identity. By extension, all the housekeeping skills of the old literati, such as poetry clocks, couplets, birthday articles, epitaphs, circular telegrams, and declarations, are acted out in this way. At the end of the Northern Song Dynasty, Huizong and Qinzong were "hunting" in the north (the word "hunting" is a trick played by literati). Emperor Gaozong of Song fled to Hangzhou to "live in peace," which was not a respectable thing. But Wang Zao wrote a handwritten letter for Empress Dowager Longyou, saying: "From the old domain of the Kang mansion, succeeding to the great unity of our dynasty; the Han family has suffered for ten generations, it is appropriate to revive Guangwu; the sons of Duke Xian were nine, only Chong'er is still alive; this is the will of heaven, how can it be human planning." How glorious and respectable he said it. The Supreme Emperor lived the life of a prisoner in the icy and snowy land, which was so embarrassing for the Song Dynasty; and Wang Zao wrote a remote congratulatory table for Emperor Gaozong to wish the Supreme Emperor longevity, saying: "Emperor Yao wandered on the sunny side of the Fen River, forgetting the world for a long time: King Wen encountered the hexagram of Brightness Injured, seeing the sage in a pot." A lid was added to the toilet, with red paint and golden hoops, which was quite beautiful. During the Jiazi Campaign, Lu Yongxiang was defeated in one battle and telegraphed his resignation. His secretary drafted: "Loving the country, I dare not lag behind others, success is not necessarily from myself?" With two light sentences, the previous words of "keeping every soldier and every armor and fighting to the death to defend the territory" were wiped out in one stroke, and he shamelessly slipped to the Eastern Ocean without shame. This kind of concealment of facts with words, finding words to say where there is nothing to say, achieved the highest achievement of the old literati's word games. In daily social writing, whether it is an old grandfather with thousands of acres of farmland or an old grandmother with many children and grandchildren, the subject matter is nothing more than good fortune; whether used for celebration or condolences, the predetermined thing is praise without blame, praise without slander. Since it is an order to write, it must be done, and you must be careful not to show your feet and flatter in the right way. For example, on Yuan Shikai's fiftieth birthday, someone congratulated him with a couplet, saying: "The Five Mountains are equally respected, but Song is the most towering; the centenary is like the sun in the middle of the sky." Wu Peifu was stationed in Luoyang as the inspector of the two lakes and was powerful for a time. Kang Youwei congratulated him on his fiftieth birthday with a couplet, saying: "The Mu Ye eagle spreads its wings, half of a hundred years of fame; the Luoyang tiger stares, and the winds and rains of the eight directions meet in the Central Continent." The two couplets happened to flatter the two heroes' exaggerated psychology and were naturally superior skills. Other epitaphs and birthday articles, saying it back and forth, are nothing more than playing with words, like putting together tangrams. Although it is just that small board, the patterns must be endless. The old literati are proud of this, and this is why we criticize them for playing with things and losing their minds. It is necessary to fundamentally eradicate this concept of word games. In a friend's gathering, everyone said, "We want to oppose the attitude of playing with words and concepts." That is not an empty slogan, it is aimed at the root of the old literati's illness!</p>
<h3>I Come From the East (2)</h3>
<p>— Hoshino</p>
<p>During this time of gentle green and soft red cherry blossoms, I bid farewell to Washington! Washington, like other cities in America, didn't have much to make me linger, but this place was a slight exception. What made me most reluctant to leave was the Library of Congress, a treasure trove of wisdom: I spent four months there; it was there that I began to understand the profound interest in reading; it was there that I discovered the ideal paradise for so-called cultured individuals; it was there that I recognized the richness and greatness of accumulated civilization. I regretted leaving this ideal place in such haste. I greatly feared that in my homeland, I would no longer be able to find such a beautiful environment for learning. And I knew deeply that this fear was the reality. When I ran out of the bronze door engraved with Greek female statues for the last time, it seemed that I had been expelled from the palace of wisdom and was moving step by step in the direction of ignorance.</p>
<p>Although the White House and the Congress had given me much interest, they were ultimately not as unforgettable as our Chinese Embassy. When I left Washington, Minister Shih had already gone to Europe. The vicinity of the Chinese Embassy on 19th Street was as quiet as ever. One or two Cantonese laundry boys walked listlessly on the street. Small children, carrying large bundles of clothes to be washed, walked out of the side door of the embassy. The gatekeeper of the embassy was an American boy. He was still so polite, as if he had also received the baptism of Confucianism. On the walls of the half-old, half-new reception room hung a photograph of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek wearing a gray military uniform. Several pieces of glass paintings inlaid with Chinese embroidery matched the antiques on the table, revealing a lack of vigor in the antique atmosphere. In a corner of the house stood an old piano, probably not played for several years:</p>
<p>I silently bid farewell to the people in the embassy, and their kind nods to me contained a very long-lasting goodwill. I hope that the next time I come here, the Chinese Embassy will have distinguished itself on the diplomatic map of Washington. I think that at that time, not only will our wise ministers' personal morals and knowledge be admired by others, but the China they represent will also be equally respected. I nodded silently to the embassy, and it seemed that I had expectations for my motherland and for myself.</p>

<h3>Records of Lingering Fragrance</h3>
<p>— Original author Princess Der Ling of Qing, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Although we knew that this situation was caused by the mischief of the eunuchs, who dared to tell the Empress Dowager? Because the habit of taking knife money and asking for rewards had become an unbreakable bad custom in the palace; even if the Empress Dowager knew about it, she could only dismiss it with a smile. On this train, there was a eunuch who specialized in making my bed and taking care of washing my face and rinsing my mouth, so I had to reward him generously again.</p>
<p>According to my own rough calculation, just taking the days we spent in the palace or the Summer Palace, we had to spend an average of twenty taels of silver in rewards every day, which is equivalent to about thirty silver coins today. In addition, there were always special expenses from time to time. My father was really burdened enough for us! But my sister and I were absolutely not good at calculating, so we really couldn't say exactly how much money our father spent to maintain us in the palace for so long; we only knew that it was definitely not a small amount! Most of it was used to buy things to present to the Empress Dowager. The things presented to the Empress Dowager were of course best if they were particularly exquisite, and the value of them can be imagined. (86)</p>
<h3>Living in the Summer Palace</h3>
<h3>Special Honor in Overseas Records</h3>
<p>— Yanqiao</p>
<p>It has always been only foreigners who come to China to buy books, ask for books, or even steal books. It has only been Chinese people's works that have been translated or reprinted. There has never been a foreign monarch who wrote a preface for a Chinese person's work, except for Overseas Records!</p>
<p>Overseas Records was written by Qing Da Shantou Weng, also known as Changshou (temple name) Stone Monk, whose poems and prose are elegant and charming. In the year of Jiaxu of the Kangxi reign, he was invited by King Ruan Fu Zhou of Annam (then known as Vietnam) to go there to lecture on scriptures and precepts. He was treated very well, and the king even treated him with the respect due to a disciple. Therefore, he wrote a preface for Weng, calling himself "Ruan Fu Zhou, King of the Great Viet Nam, a disciple who has received the Bodhisattva precepts, Dharma name Xing Tong, respectfully written in the Pure Name Abode of the Jue Wang Inner Court of the Western Palace." At that time, the entire Annam was shrouded in an atmosphere of Buddhism. The king can be said to have listened to and followed Weng in everything, and even consulted him on politics. Weng seemed to have some small skills, or what is now called Tantric Buddhism. He was able to hang banners and recite mantras in the ocean to calm the winds and waves; he was able to obtain great clear skies in the midst of prolonged rain, which was also a way to gain people's trust. He also suggested several things to the king: First, to pay tribute to China in order to rectify the name. Second, to set up strange outposts to strengthen the border. Third, to love soldiers in order to make them loyal and brave. Fourth, to establish schools to cultivate talents. This shows that he was not only preaching religion, but that his knowledge was not only in Buddhism. Religion and politics are related, especially six or seven hundred years ago. Even now, there are still people who want to use religion as a political means, such as the Japanese Buddhist Association, which is trying its best to lure Siamese lay Buddhists and monks, which is clear evidence.</p>
<p>Weng lived during the transition of dynasties and inevitably missed his homeland, so Xu Qiu of Wujiang said in his preface that he "almost entrusted himself to Zen to escape." In the preface of the King of Annam, it is known that Fu Zhou's father also invited him, but Weng did not go. Later, he responded to Fu Zhou's invitation and arrived in the country in the spring of Yihai and returned in the summer of Bingzi, staying there for more than a year. He not only discussed Buddhist studies, so it is said that "his contribution to politics was indeed great." It is also said that Weng wrote more than twenty books. I don't know what kind of books they were. I checked the Great Dictionary of Chinese Personal Names, and only Overseas Records is recorded. I don't know if there are more detailed records in the local chronicles of Guangdong? Although Annam is no longer ours, Weng's painstaking efforts at that time should not be buried. We must record it so that today's lay Buddhists and monks can see it and then ask themselves.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Fare</h3>
<p>— Kong Jie</p>
<p>! There has been such extreme heat in sixty years. The mercury in the thermometers keeps rising || Eighty degrees, ninety degrees, one hundred degrees, ... The asphalt on the road has all melted in the sun, and it feels soft to step on: the wheels of cars easily leave patterns on it. "Clap, clap, clap,..." A yellow car turned from the side road. Bare feet hit the ground. In this quiet street, the crisp sound made the dazed policeman raise his eyes and take a look.</p>
<p>The passenger's feet tapped against the edge of the car. The car stopped in front of a large Western-style house. Through the large glass window, many people could be seen talking, laughing, eating, and drinking. They didn't seem to be hot at all. The rickshaw puller wiped his sweat, all over his body and face.</p>
<p>Stepping out of the car, puffing out his chest, and whistling, the foreign sailor walked towards the revolving door. The rickshaw puller hurried after him, wiping his sweat with one hand, and gently pushing the man's waist: "..." His lips moved a few times, as if he wanted to say something, but he only stretched out one hand, his palm facing upwards, shaking slightly.</p>
<p>"Um." He glanced back slightly but still walked in.</p>
<p>The rickshaw puller still wanted to wait for him to come out, leaning on the wall and looking into the door. But his hand seemed to be hit by something, sore and painful. He raised his head and saw an Indian patrolman glaring at him, a wooden stick in his hand swinging.</p>
<p>He pulled up the car, shaking his fingers, angrily. He looked into the glass window: a glass of raised high and his mouth open, as if shouting something, the sailor who rode in his car was laughing.</p>
<h3>Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 32: The General Indulges in Pleasure Day and Night, Soldiers Return Amidst the Weeping of Old and Young</p>
<p>Because the weather was very warm, Gui Zhi told the rickshaw puller to take down the cotton cloth hood, wrapped a red woolen rope scarf around his neck, and wrapped a dog skin褥子 around the lower half of his body, putting both hands inside, which was quite warm. The car was pulled slowly, about the same as walking. After about six or seven 里, a car stopped in the middle of the road. Three or four people were surrounding the car and discussing it, seeming to be worried and unable to think of a solution. Among them, a man in a suit and a leather coat seemed to be the owner of the car, stamping his feet and scolding people. He shouted: The car is stuck here, unable to move forward or backward. What am I supposed to do? You know my concubine is sick, and I'm waiting to see her. Are you deliberately causing trouble? As he spoke, he took off the leather hat from his head, shook it a few times, and put it back on his head. Gui Zhi smiled slightly when he heard him shouting loudly for his concubine at the roadside. The man saw him smiling, but he was unwilling to accept it calmly, and he also narrowed his eyes and smiled at him. Gui Zhi blushed and dared not look at him anymore. Fortunately, although the car was pulled very slowly, it did not stop, so in just a moment, the car had passed by. Gui Zhi thought to himself, a woman really can't be careless. If it weren't for being in the car, this smile would have almost caused trouble. It is very common for women to encounter this kind of thing when they go out. When they arrived in the city and entered the new house, helping to take care of the house, of course, they did not take such a thing to heart. The place where they lived was behind the grain store, a small courtyard. Separated by two ridges, it was someone else's large Western-style building. The people in the Western-style building opened the windows and could see clearly the activities in the courtyard. At the same time, the people in the courtyard could also see clearly when they looked up at the building. Gui Zhi couldn't help but look around when he arrived at a new place. On this evening, all the windows of the building emitted electric lights. Some were separated by glass, some by white window screens, and some by red and green curtains. This alone could show the magnificence of that family. (437)</p>

<h3>Suzhou in Severe Drought</h3>
<p>— Zhu Wei</p>
<p>In this extraordinarily hot and drought-stricken time, Suzhou has not had rain for a long time. Even when dark clouds fill the sky, looking like a heavy rain is imminent, after a few gusts of hot wind, the clouds have long gone and the sky is blue, and the red sun is like fire. The heat is rising day by day, and water is becoming scarcer day by day. Under this severe drought situation, major unrest has long occurred in Suzhou society; everyone's heart is heavily burdened by the stone of fear of famine. Therefore, the strange dramas under feudalism in the era of autocracy are being re-enacted one by one today.</p>
<p>▲ Desperate Measures "People call out to heaven when they are poor. Desperate measures". In this age of science, superstition still occupies a huge force in the hearts of our people. The local gentry are promoting the praying to the bronze Guanyin, the Taoist priests are setting up the Eight Trigrams Formation, writing bloody petitions, and the monks are also burning incense and praying. There are even rumors that a certain Taoist priest is willing to sacrifice himself to pray for rain, burning himself on top of three loads of areca incense. As for the people's dragon lantern parade and praying to the Dragon God, they are even more surging like a storm. The residents outside the 閶門 Gate specially invited the Red-Faced Golden Dragon Great King to parade in the city; in front were bicycle teams and banners with the slogan "Heaven Sends Sweet Rain", as well as moving dragon lanterns, fishermen catching mussels, lake boats, and other toys; firecrackers crackling, rockets booming. These people, under the scorching sun, still have to show off their skills and perform good shows. Strange shapes, as if performing a weird African drama on the silver screen!</p>
<p>▲ Digging Wells When Thirsty The river water has turned from green to black; the well water has also turned from turbid to dry. In this time of increasing demand for water for drinking tea, bathing, and washing clothes, how can people not be greatly alarmed! Only a few teahouses get river water, which is loaded into tin boxes and transported into the city by rickshaws, as precious as jade nectar. An ordinary load of cold water has reached thirty copper coins. Although merchants or residents with tap water automatically open it for people to use, it still cannot meet the demand. Therefore, a group of residents are deepening the digging in the dry wells in order to find water sources. In the "Zhu Zi's Family Instructions", there is a saying "Dig wells when thirsty", but under this severe drought, you cannot help but dig wells when you are thirsty. ▲ Rice Like Pearls and Firewood Like Cassia Although the year is so bad, the drought situation has severely unfolded in front of us; the fields are cracked, and the seedlings have all died. The rice merchants are watching the rice they have hoarded have great profits to be made, so they are soaring in price every day. In just half a month, a load of rice that cost seven yuan has risen to over twelve yuan. However, looking forward to the future, the soaring is intense, and it is really unknown how expensive it will be! Rice straw in the past few days has also risen from one yuan for 320 jin to one yuan for 150 or 60 jin. Under these three high prices of rice, firewood, and water, a group of poor people who are struggling to survive are even more unable to survive; therefore, the tragic scenes of pawning their wives into prostitution and committing suicide by drowning are gradually being performed one by one in the human hell. Rice is like pearls, and firewood is like cassia. Looking forward to the future, it is really unbearable to think about! I don't want to think about it! ▲ Commercial Depression The weather is so hot, the water is so scarce, and everyone's heart is filled with the fear of drought. Although the stores are trying their best to have big discounts, the doors are wide open, and there are few customers. Especially the entertainment industry, Beijing opera has all closed for the summer. The actors who perform in the plays, because they have no wages, have even sold their furniture to pay for their travel expenses. The movie theaters have also closed, leaving only two out of five. A certain song and dance troupe, because they have no money to return, have to stand up and work hard to perform on stage to earn a living. As for the 难簧 and others, they have long been closed. Because of the commercial depression, most stores also operate cold drink businesses. Sour plum soup stalls are every five steps, and stores are every ten steps, but although there are many ice shops, there are too few customers. Most of them are "guests are often absent from their seats, and there is little water in the bottles."</p>
<p>▲ Drought Relief Meeting Under this severe drought situation, the superstitious methods of drought relief have all lost their effectiveness. Therefore, the local officials, who are the parents of the people, and enthusiastic people, jointly held a drought relief meeting in the county government. On the one hand, they are opening up the 胥門涵洞 culvert and irrigating water into the city, and on the other hand, they are attracting water from Taihu Lake and Jinji Lake to irrigate farmland. The Tianye Association and the county government are using 20,000 yuan in funds to purchase a large number of water-lifting machines. The local gentry Zhang Yipeng is personally leading more than 30 villagers to Shanghai to learn water-lifting techniques. The county magistrate Wu is also setting the success or failure of drought relief in each district chief as the standard for their retention or dismissal. Under this unity of purpose from top to bottom and efforts to relieve the drought, if the heavens do not want the suffering people of Suzhou to be reduced to fish trapped in a dry rut, it would be good to send down some sweet rain to relieve these many people who have no way to appeal.</p>

<h3>Commercial News Major Financial Institutions Eager to Sell Off Bullion Price Drops by $1.80</h3>
<p>Recently, the gold market has been sluggish and difficult to rise. Yesterday, the overseas silver market fell, and the exchange rate of banks was very tight, but the situation in the market was still weak and extremely difficult to revive, which led to the decline of the will of the major bullish players. Speculators such as Wu came to sell off, resulting in a fall. At the beginning of the morning, the overseas silver market, British currency shrunk and US currency remained flat. The futures silver price of the Five Metals Exchange, except for the March increase of three cents, the remaining shrunk by four cents to one dime and six mils. The exchange rate was extremely flat. US cotton rose by seven pounds, US wheat rose by one and a half cents, London raw gold fell by half a penny, and stocks fell slightly. The pre-market trading opened only relatively stable, and people's minds were normal. Retail investors pressed down, resulting in a downstream immediately after opening, but the appetite of banks was fierce, and the internal market of forward US dollars was tighter than the previous close. The gold price was pulled up, and the banks closed the near term, and soon announced another setback. The speculator Wu had supply and was low, but the appetite of the banks remained fierce, and the situation stabilized. This sacrificial speculator Wu repeatedly sold off, but the gold price left with a hedge, and the low-price buyers were brave and able to maintain it. After that, the Seattle night market silver price reported a decline of 125.25 points, and it once recovered, but the trend was still weak. The supply from major institutions was frequent, and it gradually declined. There was still a struggle in the middle, but it was difficult to support the market due to the constant selling pressure. People were anxious and lacked energy. The noon closed with a low, and there was no special telegram for half a day. Compared with the British and Japanese banks in this port, it was said that the difference was as large as one penny and eight hundred seventy-five mils. After continuous sales by China for several days, it has now retreated to within one penny, and it is feared that it will be difficult to have the power to sell. Therefore, the large players naturally hoped for a return to growth. Under this tragic situation, it is difficult for the silver price to shrink, and the short sellers have no great danger. If there is a slight rebound, the selling pressure will inevitably continue, and the trend will be downward, resulting in the buyers not daring to do much activity. The gold price is 996 yuan and 70 cents, and the swap is 4 yuan strong. The market situation for half a day is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opened at 984 yuan and 70 cents, a slight increase of one dime compared to the previous close. The goods opened at 4 yuan and 60 cents. The exchange rate in the morning was 1 shilling and 4 pence and 1875 mills for the near-term selling price of British currency, and 34 yuan for the US currency. People's minds were exhausted, and Chengkang and retail investors all sold, and it fell to 3 yuan and 40 cents, but the appetite of the banks tended to be fierce, and the internal market was very tight. Shanghai Mitsui closed US dollars in October 3125. Yuan Maoyong Yu Qing Yong Yi Feng Yong Yongli Yongde Qing Yu items and other items successively bought in, and rose to 6 yuan and 30 cents. Huabi closed US dollars in August 0625, and Xiang Hefu and Yong Yifeng Yong Da De Cheng sold to 4 yuan and 60 cents. The exchange rate of HSBC was still flat in the British and American markets, hovering around 5 yuan. Yuan Chang Yongheng Yu entered to 5 yuan and 20 cents. Retail investors suppressed the small, and Fu Yu Dade Cheng Heng Tai Tong Chunlai sold, and fell to 3 yuan and 60 cents. Mitsui ate US dollars in September 1875, and Fu Yu Tongyi took advantage of the low price to enter, and rose to 4 yuan and 70 cents. Yifeng Yongfu Yu Yuanchun sold off, and fell to 3 yuan and 70 cents. Magali closed US dollars in October 3125. Yuan Yilai entered and remained stable. When the Seattle night market silver price fell from 125 to half points, Yuan Chang Yongli bought endlessly, and Yuan Maoyong Yifeng Yong also bought in, and rose to 5 yuan and 40 cents. Dingkang Yuanmao took advantage of the high price to supply, and the bank sold out the near-term US currency and went downstream. After entering, Yuan Maoyong repeatedly sold off, and Dade Cheng Hongkang Yong Qian Chang Xiang Dingkang Zhaofeng Chang and others jointly supplied, and people were originally timid. The noon closed and fell to 982 yuan and 80 cents, and the goods were auctioned at 2 yuan and 30 cents. After the closing, Huixiang Chengkang Dacheng Hongkang Yong Dingkang Tianfeng Chang Sheng Yong Yongde and others sold off one after another, and the trend was even weaker. The highest price in half a day was 986 yuan and 30 cents, and the lowest price was 982 yuan and 80 cents, a total of 3 yuan and a half. As a result, the previous close fell by 1 yuan and 80 cents. The closing price was 33 yuan and 625 points for the HSBC Bank US currency exchange rate, which was 1,029 yuan for the combined gold price. According to the closing price, it was about 46 yuan, which was 2 yuan less than the previous one. The registered price in August was 987 yuan, and in September it was 983 yuan. The morning replenishment was 987 yuan, and the gold price was 996 yuan and 70 cents. The market trading was still active, and the general spot number bought in the spot and dropped the August note to do a swap. The Tianjin goods were plus 14 yuan and a half, and sold to the spot by the Tianjin gang for about 1,000 taels. In addition, the East goods were plus 13 yuan and 25 cents, and still bought in by the spot number for more than 2,000 taels. The swap premium was slightly more expensive. Shanyicheng posted to Yingfengheng 49 notes for 4 yuan and 10 cents, and Huiyuan posted to Yingfengheng 35 notes for 4 yuan and a half. In addition, the spot number still swapped the spot for August double, and the buyer still posted more than 4 days of interest.</p>

<h3>Silver Dollar Market as Quiet as Ever</h3>
<p>Under the current economic collapse, it is not easy for the silver and money industry to maintain the status quo, let alone make progress. Moreover, at this time of prolonged drought, people are generally feeling extremely panicked, and the silver and money industry has become silent, only waiting for the right time to move and overcome the difficulties. Yesterday, the market's silver dollar call loan rate remained at 5%. The morning and afternoon settlements were the same. The overnight loan rate did not increase. Call loan transactions were also unusually sluggish. The estimated morning turnover and new transactions were over 1.9 million, and the afternoon turnover was over 300,000. The total turnover in the Small General Association was over 400,000. Silver dollar pledges and redemptions were over 400,000, and new transactions were over 900,000.

<h3>Jiangnan Market Sentiment Sluggish</h3>
<p>▲Copper Coin Large Board Reduced by 2,500 Cash</p>
<p>Yesterday, the early market for small silver dollars in Jiangnan traded at 835 yuan, a decrease of 1.5 yuan compared to the previous day. The afternoon market remained the same. Transactions were exceptionally quiet. The estimated turnover in the early market was 2,000 silver dollars, and in the afternoon market, 3,000 silver dollars.

<h3>Securities: Public Bonds' Bullish Trend Broken and Resumed</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the bullish trend in the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange market was surprisingly revived. Since President Wang returned to Beijing and attended meetings as usual, political rumors subsided, and the bulls' enthusiasm increased. The bears had to start covering their positions to avoid being squeezed near the delivery date. On the trading floor, the No. 4 bond was the most actively traded. The bullish trend in the bond market was broken and resumed and is expected to continue. The outlook remains positive, possibly rising along a curve. Yesterday morning, the market opened with significant gains, with the Disbandment bonds rising by 1.12 yuan to make up for the previous day's shortfall. Other bonds also rose across the board. However, after the Salt Tax bonds, the upward momentum seemed to weaken slightly. The 96 bonds for the current month rose by a large margin of 1.35 yuan, while the forward bonds only rose by 0.35 yuan due to short covering, a difference that was too large, causing suspicion among some. In the second session, various leading bonds fell back by 0.1 to 0.3 yuan due to retail selling. Starting with the forward Salt Tax bonds, they resumed their upward trajectory, improving by 0.2 to 0.45 yuan. The 96 bonds for the current month turned from low to high, regaining a small 0.45 yuan, while the forward bonds improved by 0.2 yuan. The trend for the 96 bonds seemed to have stabilized, and the bullish trend should continue. Market prices ended with gains ranging from 0.3 to 0.95 yuan. The total turnover was approximately 20 million yuan. The details of the increases and decreases are listed below (unit: yuan):</p>

<h3>Labor Unrest Spreads to New York Stock Market</h3>
<p>The Xinhua Yanghang reported that yesterday (the 17th), the New York stock market was sluggish and uneven, slightly lower. Trading was sluggish due to strikes on the Pacific coast, labor unrest elsewhere, poor railway reports, and rumors of alcohol price reductions. Industrial news was lackluster. Small exchange stocks and bonds also fluctuated. The grain market turned upward due to buying demand. The total daily turnover was 620,000 shares. According to agent reports, the (securities) market was slightly firm due to buyers and will remain uneven. (Grain) Corn futures collapsed rapidly, which will affect the price of wheat. It is advisable to buy during declines. According to Mr. Maolai's estimate, since the government's estimate was released on July 1, the loss of corn in various drought-stricken states is approximately 28.3 million bushels. (Cotton) Traders are not concerned about the market's technical position, labor unrest, and low consumption. The market is still rising due to the drought in Texas. The situation seems to be continuing to strengthen. The yarn market is more dispersed than before. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed below:</p>
<p>July 16 July 17 Increase/Decrease</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 67.04 96.79 Down 0.23</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks 42.23 41.93 Down 0.28</p>
<p>20 Utility Stocks 23.39 13.33 Down 0.06</p>

<p>11 Commodities 38.86 39.18 Up 0.32</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Buying Trend Reappears in the Yarn Market</h3>
<p>The yarn market is calm and the situation is relatively stable. Because a certain factory's internal affairs have not been resolved, and there are occasional news reports, rumors have started again in the market, saying that there will be a work stoppage. As a result, the buying trend has slightly increased. However, the current yarn sales have slowed down. In short, the market is in a state of consolidation. However, as the delivery period for this month approaches, the strength of the rise and fall depends entirely on whether the buyers are willing to take delivery.</p>
<h3>Golden Rooster Recovers</h3>
<p>The opening price of the yarn futures market was boosted by good U.S. cotton prices and a scarcity of sellers in the market. Moreover, the complex internal situation of a certain factory made it difficult to resolve for the time being, and rumors of a work stoppage resurfaced. Therefore, the bulls' intentions were even stronger, and most of the amounts were in the hands of the financial sector. As the market tightened, the situation became more expensive.

<h3>Active Deliveries: Recent Cotton Market Sentiment Very Weak</h3>
<p>The market for old cotton is very weak. The main operators of the bull companies and a certain cotton firm are delivering all 20,000 to 30,000 piculs of cotton they received last month in July. Moreover, the Han and Huang groups are also delivering around 20,000 piculs. As a result, the market sentiment is very weak. Furthermore, more factories are reducing production and stopping work, leading to a decrease in consumption, which is the biggest reason for the bearish outlook on old cotton. However, new cotton, especially foreign cotton, is firm, and people are more bullish, leading to a slight increase.</p>
<h3>Zheng Standard Falls and New Rises</h3>
<p>The opening price of standard cotton futures market was again characterized by a fall in old cotton prices, and the momentum was strong due to congested deliveries and a lack of receivers. However, new cotton rose by five pounds per sound due to the firm prices of U.S. cotton, and the bulls' righteousness was still strong, so the market situation was not very weak. However, there were scattered showers in various places, and people's minds calmed down slightly. As a result, old cotton fell by 0.15 to 0.25 yuan, and new cotton rose by 0.15 yuan. The total turnover was 82,100 dan. Tongfu sold 1,200 dan, Tongji 1,600 dan, Hengyi 1,000 dan, Dafeng 3,000 dan, Zhenda 3,100 dan, Huikang 2,000 dan, Shenchang 3,200 dan, Yuanyi 1,500 dan, Changfeng 6,000 dan, [blank space] Sheng 2,000 dan.

<h3>Spot Cotton Mills' Appetite Sluggish</h3>
<p>The actual demand for spot cotton is quite sluggish. The appetite of various factories for cotton is very sluggish. The source of cotton is 50 bales of Yao cotton.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Trading Only Up to the 25th of This Month</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Exchange has set the delivery date for the July standard yarn and cotton futures for the 30th of this month. Trading will be suspended for one day. Yarn and cotton business for this month will be conducted up to the 25th. This has already been announced in the market.</p>
<h3>Overseas Cotton Market Mixed</h3>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton was initially weak due to poor news from Liverpool, but later strengthened due to the severe drought in Texas and purchases by industry peers. As a result, spot prices rose by 5 pounds per sound, and futures prices rose by 3 to 7 pounds per sound. British cotton futures fell by 3 points. Indian cotton was initially strong due to speculation, but later fell back due to large-scale profit-taking by bulls. As a result, Ping G爾 fell by 0.25 yuan, Omura fell by 1 rupee, and Bai Luo Xi fell by 0.75 yuan. Yuan Dian green left, (17th Electric).</p>

<h3>Grains: Continued Rainfall Causes Flour and Wheat to Fall Across the Board</h3>
<p>▲Flour: Yesterday, the flour market, after opening in the morning, showed a clear trend of continued decline in all months. Although the quoted price of foreign wheat in Chicago was good at 0.40 yuan, and in Canada it was good at 0.50 yuan, the local and foreign areas, after a long drought, had seen timely rain. Although the rainfall was still insufficient, people generally felt that it was better than nothing. Therefore, although the opening price for the current month was 0.06 yuan, the price fell in subsequent sessions due to the rain. Some of the floating bulls took the opportunity to sell, and manufacturers also sold forward contracts, causing the market sentiment to trend downward significantly. However, the recent business with the Tianjin group has been active, and many recent prices have been collected. It is said that the silver and money groups are continuing to buy, and the amount is also considerable. Therefore, the transaction volume in half a day reached over 1.2 million bags. In the current situation, if there is abundant rainfall in all areas and a good autumn harvest, the tense atmosphere will gradually ease. As a result, the current month fell by another 0.025 yuan, August fell by 0.02 yuan, September and October fell by 0.0175 yuan, November fell by 0.0125 yuan, and December fell by 0.02 yuan.</p>
<p>▲Wheat: Yesterday, the wheat futures market was generally flat and weak. Although the quoted price of foreign wheat in Chicago and Canada continued to be good at 0.4 to 0.5 yuan, the market sentiment, due to the change in weather and the continued rainfall in various areas, immediately eased after the long drought, and the market sentiment was easy to ease. Moreover, wheat itself is a rich harvest, and there is no shortage of goods. Therefore, the market weakened as soon as the welcome rain appeared. It can be seen that speculative hype is very different from the facts. The opening price of each session was weak. As a result, the current month was small by 0.018, September and October were small by 0.04 yuan, and November and December were small by 0.02 yuan. The spot wheat market is stable. Arrivals are continuous and sales are not strong. The price of wheat from Pukou and Yangzhou is 3.1 yuan, Changzhou wheat is 3.16 yuan, Shandong wheat is 3.27 yuan, Jiangjiaba and Chuzhou wheat is 3.22 yuan, Nansuizhou wheat is 3.25 yuan, Bengbu wheat is 3.24 yuan, Qingjiang wheat is 3.2 yuan, and Jiangxinzhou wheat is 3.18 yuan. 10,000 bags were purchased by Fuxin, 8,000 bags by Fufeng, and 2,000 bags by Xinda.</p>
<h3>River Rice Continues to Fall Due to Rain</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various groups arrived only at the 13th and 14th numbers (about 2,000 stones), and since the continuous rain, people's hearts have changed their perspective, so most people are watching and waiting, not willing to take action lightly. Although there may be some activity, the number is limited, so the overall situation is stagnant. Later, although the Qingdao group continued to purchase, the number was only over 200 bags. As a result, the market sentiment finally went downstream. For example, the prices of thick粳 and late rice from various groups with higher prices were cut by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan, and medium-grade products fell by 0.5 to 0.6 yuan. Du Yang tip and Yinbian Yuan could not avoid being affected, and were also brought down by a certain amount.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various routes in Hexia were 14th and 15th. The various sales markets in the city were weak due to the sudden cloudy and rainy weather, and retail sales were sluggish. The prices of Bai粳, thin稻, medium-grade, and early rice were slightly down by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan, the price of Baiyuan was slightly down by a corner or so, and the prices of Yangjian and Dujian were down by one or two corners, and the prices of the port tip were also short by a corner.</p>
<h3>Foreign客秈 Falls Back by 0.1 to 0.2 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, orders for foreign rice continued to be placed, and the number and price have not been announced, but the total price including fees and taxes still needs to be around 10 yuan. The goods are Saigon No. 1 round grain and long grain, etc. As of now, the total number of transactions has exceeded approximately 150,000 bags, but less than 10,000 tons have been announced in the market. Yesterday, due to the rain in the producing area and the repeated transactions of foreign rice, the market sentiment went down, and the market price immediately fell by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. Garden households stopped, and customers were not as eager to buy as before, so yesterday's transactions decreased. The whole city only had the Beiyang method to purchase 1,000 bags of Hunan Ji Jing, and this street purchased nearly 1,000 bags of machine oil and brown rice. The Xiaojiao rice was jointly purchased by this street and the Yongbang group with 5,000 bags. There were no other imports and exports.</p>
<p>It is also reported that after the price of rice in Shanghai soared due to the drought, rice merchants had a discussion about purchasing foreign rice to suppress the market price. Soon, there was a transaction of Saigon No. 1, and the market price has been suppressed. However, foreign merchants are busy soliciting orders every day, and the local market price in Saigon and Rangoon has risen accordingly. The current Saigon price is 11 yuan, which is no longer worth transporting.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: White Sugar Sales Also Affected by Drought</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trend in the sugar market was flat. The association's market quotation for 24 coarse sand white spot goods was 19.85 yuan, with no rise or fall. The price of goods delivered at the wharf was 19.98 yuan for coarser particles, and 6.5 yuan for higher-quality transit goods, and 6.4 yuan for ordinary goods. There was a shortage of goods. Taikoo Sugar B mark was priced at 20.4 yuan, at the original price. Dealers bargained for 0.3 yuan, but no deal was made. The factory's cotton white sugar still had few shipments, with No. 1 priced at 19 yuan, standing firm. Dutch transit goods were also priced at 6.2 yuan. Due to the drought and poor waterway access in Chaoqing, which is similar to the upper Jiang area in the mainland, sales decreased, so the market quotation became fixed. Yesterday, over 60 bags of assorted brand茹粉 opened at 7.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: The Trend of New Golden Vegetables Has Stabilized Slightly</h3>
<p>Since the emergence of new daylily, the market price has fallen repeatedly, and now it has reached a low level. The trend has stabilized slightly. Yesterday, the market price for Da Yu vegetables was 16.5 yuan, and for Xuzhou vegetables, 15 yuan. The Quanzhou group jointly purchased over 200 bags, and sales were better. Most of the rest were scattered. The market price for Da Yu vegetables was 17.2 yuan, and the second-grade was around 16 yuan. Xuzhou vegetables were 15.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Black Tea Sells Well, Green Tea Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, for black tea from Qimen, Ningzhou, Yichang, etc., the British Zhuang, Tianxiang, Yihong Xiehe and other firms, and the Russian Association of Assistance, tended to have strong intakes. The whole city sold over 2,700 boxes, including Yichang high-grade goods, with the top price opening at 115 yuan, and Ning tea selling at 53 yuan. Prices were firm. However, the green tea market turned sluggish. A large number of high-quality tea from Wuyuan, Tunxi, etc., arrived for several days, but the quotes from British and French firms were tight, and sales were very sluggish.</p>
<h3>Large Batch of New Tea Shipped to Russia</h3>
<p>This year's silk and tea trade, the foreign trade of Huzhou silk has been affected by Japanese silk. According to shipping companies, the total number of Huzhou silk shipped to Europe in the past two months is less than 500 bales, which is only 5% compared to previous years, showing the sluggishness of silk sales. However, the export of new tea is still good, but it is not as prosperous as in previous years. The British previously exported 12,000 boxes to London. It is now reported that the Russian Association of Assistance has also purchased a large batch of black and green tea and tea bricks. Because Russian ships are insufficient for transportation, they have also leased the Yingzhou输 from Taikoo Company in this port, loaded with over 15,000 boxes, which will be exported this morning and shipped to Vladivostok, where it will be transferred to the Middle East Railway to Russia.</p>
<h3>Metals　Someone Hoarding German Tinplate</h3>
<p>German tinplate is favored by manufacturers due to its softness, aesthetic quality, and relatively low price. Despite the recent mold and damp season, there are still many buyers. However, overseas telegraphs indicate rising prices, and local merchants may also raise prices. Hoarders, upon hearing this news, believe there will be a bullish trend after autumn and are buying up the material. It is said that over two thousand boxes were purchased yesterday, causing market sentiment to surge and prices to become increasingly firm, with double sheets selling for thirty yuan and single sheets for fifteen yuan and ten cents.</p>

<p>Talking Points</p>
<h3>On Being Earnest</h3>
<p>— Mother Me</p>
<p>Nowadays, if someone were to follow the ancient teaching of "words faithful, conduct respectful," they would surely be ridiculed as a fool. Because they are too earnest. People these days are such that: the more they brag when speaking, the more hypocritical and treacherous they are when acting, the more they are flattered. If you speak honestly and do your duty, you are a fool. Confucius' disciples like Zeng Shen were earnest and cautious, reflecting on themselves three times a day: "Have I been disloyal in serving others? Have I been untrustworthy in my dealings with friends? Have I neglected to practice what is taught?" This kind of earnest moral behavior has long been overthrown. The heroes of today reflect on themselves three times a day: "Have I been hypocritical and treacherous in my work? Have I broken my promises and bragged to my friends? Have I done enough selfish things?" After reflecting once, twice, three times, and realizing that their daily actions are hypocritical and treacherous, that they have broken their promises and bragged to their friends, and that they have mastered the art of selfishness, then they can rest assured. In a society where everyone is like this, where selfishness has become the prevailing morality, if you are earnest, you are a fool.</p>
<p>For example, if you earnestly want to contribute to the New Culture Movement, while those who advocate for restoring the old ways are using it to seek fame and fortune, and those who oppose restoring the old ways are also using it to gain prominence in the literary world, they each have their own agendas and have long deviated from the original topic. Although the negative impact on society is not small, if you earnestly want to contribute to the New Culture Movement, you, the earnest fool, will be the one to suffer. No matter how loudly you shout, those who advocate for restoring the old ways have already achieved their goals of seeking fame and fortune and stand by and laugh at you, while those who oppose restoring the old ways dislike you for not following their lead and discussing abstract issues. They simply abandon pursuing the enemy and instead give you a blow head-on, leaving you confused and unjustly criticized and beaten. Besides being ridiculed as a fool, the earnest person is also accused of being "neurotic and muddle-headed" and a "senile and declining element." People today should learn a lesson: being too earnest and too honest is also a fault. Heaven knows what will happen on the Great Stage!</p>
<h3>The Remains of Past Wounds</h3>
<p>— Nan Ding</p>
<p>Receiving her letter gave me a sudden and unexpected shock. But her sincerity and understanding towards me made me deeply feel the meaning and value of my current life, and for this, I cannot help but express my sincere gratitude to her. However, one thing makes me feel deeply uneasy: her recent sudden change in spirit. This change, needless to say, will shake the faith between us and the happiness of our future life.</p>
<p>If there is a thread of passion connecting us, what a terrible change this would be! In short, if I hold a heart of disappointment towards her, and she holds the same attitude towards me - a sense of discouragement and indifference - then I believe that in the near future, not only will we be unable to escape the remnants of past wounds, but we will also accelerate our journey down the path of human tragedy. This, I believe, she would never be willing to endure. Because we have a vision of a future life, we are not afraid to struggle arduously. Otherwise, why would we seek out troubles in the first place, and why would we advance forward recklessly amidst dangerous and thorny circumstances, disregarding life and death?</p>
<p>But at this moment, the reality has caused me a kind of bewilderment, a sorrowful sadness. In each word and line of her letter, it is filled with the infinite darkness and cruelty of human life, with sorrow and tragedy.</p>
<p>"Ah..." she said, "I only have tears, only tears. My blood has already been shed, my heart has already been broken. I no longer view life as I did before..."</p>
<p>Her words, bursting forth from the depths of her life, like blood and tears, moved me, moved even someone with a heart of stone like me. Thinking of this, my heart became even more grieved. My chest felt as if something was blocking it, and my breathing became slow and tense. I simply could not think of a word that could adequately describe my state of mind.</p>
<p>And so, I remained silent for a while, and my mind began to spin. I was fantasizing about the past, hesitating about the present, and fearing the future. I thought of the decline of my will, the spread of demonic forces, the inner workings of the human world, and her face, her mood, her destiny - threatened by fierce flames, entangled by shame... I thought, I was fantasizing about everything. It was as if I was no longer living. At this moment, I only felt the dreadfulness of life, the sadness of death, the extreme emptiness and the agony of the contradictions of my inner life hidden within my soul. Ah! What use am I anymore?</p>
<p>Thinking of this, truly, I could not help but almost cry. At this moment, I felt that crying, shedding tears, was not entirely a sign of weakness. It is the most satisfying thing in people's suffering. Because crying, tears, can dissolve the sadness in our hearts and cleanse the stains on our minds. It is the power that can most move people. From erroneous actions, do people not often use tears to repent?</p>
<p>Therefore, in the abyss of suffering, besides tears being sufficient to relieve some of it, I believe that there is nothing in the world more effective. Perhaps someone will scorn me: "You are too useless, always so sentimental! A hopeless case!"</p>
<p>Friends, I can only answer you with a smile...</p>
<p>In days of hardship and distress, my life has been tormented enough, my fate has been attacked, and the career created by my heart and soul has been destroyed. In the piercingly painful battlefield, I came to know this life, I came to know this thorny world.</p>
<p>Although I have experienced an extreme conflict regarding my past life and present state of mind, soon after, for her passion towards me, for my future and career, on the new consciousness, I extinguished the sadness of my destruction, and the remnants of past wounds were gradually expelled from my heart...</p>
<h3>Nonsense</h3>
<p>— Cultural Beggar</p>
<p>Culture is man-made, but culture often harms people.</p>
<p>Harmful culture is resisted, overthrown, and extinguished by some; it is maintained, supported, and used by others.</p>
<p>The sun and the Earth are changing organisms daily in a process of constant renewal, but humanity is now going backward and restoring the old ways. If our culture were to return to the belief that "the sky is round and the Earth is square," and everyone had enough to eat, becoming citizens of the age of Getian, that would also be good.</p>
<p>Those who praise the prosperous Tang dynasty would refuse to promote the story of Yao abdicating the throne to Shun.</p>
<p>Some who advocate for restoring the old ways worship Confucius, some worship Yue Fei, but I don't know if anyone worships Qin Shi Huang. However, no one publicly worships Yuan Shikai anymore.</p>
<p>If there were to come a day when men all wore queues and women all had three-inch golden lotuses, worshiping Guan Yu riding his horse and wielding the Green Dragon Crescent Blade, and worshiping Zhuge Liang wearing his Eight Trigram Robe and holding his feather fan, at the grand celebration of the Restoration Movement, someone would surely wear Confucius' square hat.</p>
<p>In times of drought, there are Taoist priests at the altar and living Buddhas praying for rain. Why doesn't anyone learn from Zhuge Liang and pray for an east wind on the Seven Star Altar? In summer, if there is an east wind, rain will surely come. (As the old farmers in my hometown say: "One dou of east wind brings three dou of rain.")</p>
<p>Chinese compatriots are now either in deep water (in the North) or in the fiery heat (in the South). Some people propose emigration. In that case, harmonizing and adjusting would bring everyone peace and happiness, which is what the ancients taught.</p>
<h3>Reading "Me and Literature"</h3>
<p>— He Juefu</p>
<p>Some time ago, books like "How to Write Articles," "Creating Humanity," and "Descriptive Dictionaries"... were once popular. Later, because many readers, after reading several of these books, still could not write articles and dared not be deceived by the editors and bookstore owners, and because informed people at the time gave forceful criticisms, believing that there is no predetermined method for writing articles, these kinds of books disappeared. Following "How to Write Articles" and "Introduction to Creation"... what appeared were "Author Autobiographies," "Creative Experiences"... and the like. Although these works cannot be lumped together with the former, many impatient readers still hope to glean the writing secrets of established writers from them, thinking that it is a step to advance themselves; therefore, this kind of business is also quite profitable for a while.</p>
<p>Presumably, the readers' weak hearts are obvious to everyone, so now many editors and bookstore owners are putting their efforts in this direction.</p>
<p>"Me and Literature," which is a special issue commemorating the first anniversary of the "Literature Magazine," has a relatively fresh and elegant title, but in essence, it is just the same kind of thing as "Author Autobiographies," "Creative Experiences"... and the like. At the same time, because "Literature Magazine" has become a first-class literary publication in China, the publication of this book is guaranteed to attract a large number of impatient readers.</p>
<p>In fact, it is indeed beneficial for a writer to honestly and truthfully write down how he grew up and provide it to readers for reference. The difficulty lies in opening one's eyes and telling personal matters to others, which inevitably involves some exaggeration, embellishment, and distortion... Someone said that they can truthfully tell their own stories, but I think this reason is not very sufficient. Open up the three hundred-plus pages of "Me and Literature" and carefully look at the tone of the five or six writers. It is extremely interesting... Some say that they have no affinity with literature, some say that they were forced to take the road of literature, some say that they are only an observer of literature, some say that they are only a small gardener in the garden of literature, some say that they have a love and interest in literature, some say how difficult and arduous it is to run on the road of literature, and some even offer their own views, understandings, and ideas on literature, and so on. Furthermore, some even introduce several of their own works, as if they are teaching readers to buy them and read them; some even definitively point out which of their works caused a sensation throughout society and touched the hearts of many readers, teaching readers to be unable to help but prostrate themselves in admiration of his greatness(?); some even write their past as a supremely intelligent child prodigy, teaching dull and mediocre people not to dream of literature anymore; some even put on the airs of a gentleman, teaching those engaged in creation to adopt a certain attitude and hold a certain purpose, the sour arrogance overflowing between the lines... In short, what is included and adopted here is truly bizarre and all-encompassing. But one thing is common, that is, whose past is glorious and fulfilling, whose writing attitude is faithful and sincere, and whose hope for the future is to embark on a "new" path!</p>
<p>Impatient readers who want to find a shortcut here will surely be disappointed; however, people's talents, people's environments, and people's thoughts are not cast in the same mold, and the things in the universe are constantly changing. It is of course impossible to force an advanced author to tell you which road to take and how to walk it. Advanced people can only honestly write out their experiences for the reference of later people, which is considered satisfactory; unfortunately, even places for reference are not very visible here.</p>
<p>If publishing a book is not for utilitarian purposes (referring to society and the readers) but only to have fun, then there is nothing to say; if the intention was not like this, then it is an unnecessary waste.</p>
<p>The editor says in the introduction: "...This time, our solicitation of articles has unintentionally fulfilled a bit of the mission of literary history, not just to join in the fun. There are also quite a few articles that are simply detailed autobiographies of each writer's literary life. It is expected that in a hundred or so years, these articles may become valuable materials for literary history. How can we ignore them?" Perhaps this is because of the editor's position, and they can only say so.</p>
<h3>Chinese Dogs</h3>
<p>— A Feng</p>
<p>The Jinan correspondent reported the municipal feral dogs are numerous. The dog prison near the Hongzi Factory has now housed more than two thousand heads, which cannot be transported out. It is still necessary to feed them every day. Special permission has been granted to Chairman Han of the province to execute these two thousand-odd feral dogs under Thousand Buddha Mountain. It is really pitiful.</p>
<p>Now countries are expanding their navies, manufacturing airships, and everyone is sharpening their swords, preparing to kill in the Second World War. However, police dogs are also a very necessary tool in wartime. Therefore, countries spare no expense to buy them in large quantities and train them into armies. I think a few police dogs are destined to be very successful in the Second World War.</p>
<p>Some say that foreign police dogs drink milk and eat beef, so foreign dogs are very strong and agile, while Chinese dogs cannot even eat their fill of leftovers and water, so how can they be strong and agile? If Chinese dogs were treated as well as foreign dogs, then Chinese dogs could be used for issuing instructions and commands.</p>
<p>I say this is not right. No matter what good things you give Chinese dogs to eat, I'm afraid they will become more and more lazy and more and more昏庸. Therefore, no one cares about them and they are only sent to Thousand Buddha Mountain to be executed. Although China does not have police dogs, another kind of dog is produced in abundance and is very famous. What kind of dog is this? It is the running dog welcomed by the Japanese stinking factory.</p>
<h3>Formless Literati</h3>
<p>— Mu Lin</p>
<p>Scolding people is indeed enjoyable, but being scolded is being enjoyed by others. So when you want to enjoy yourself, you must guard against others enjoying themselves. The game of scolding people is now very lively in the literary world. There have been too many examples in the past, from playing mahjong to Zhuangzi's literary selections, the Xu and He incidents... to vernacular and mass language, and the film world has also engaged in both soft and hard confrontations. At first, it was still a literati attitude, making theoretical criticisms. Gradually, the battle area expanded, the combatants increased, and gradually it turned from theory to random scolding. Otherwise, personal secrets were attacked, leading to no results and everyone retreating. Waiting for opportunities to prepare for a second time - this is not me deliberately spreading rumors. A certain writer wrote to the editor of a certain magazine, asking why they weren't scolding people anymore. This person is truly afraid that the world will not be in chaos? The soft and hard struggle in the film world is also a mess. The gentlemen who sank into the sofa released the final means of the literati when surrounded by enemies, saying that hardness is "leftist" (hardness and softness are not discussed in this article, nor is any party protected). It seems too shameless for literati to use such a vicious method?</p>
<p>Today, literati are truly at the end of their road, restricted by all parties everywhere. Perhaps due to carelessness in writing, they cause great disputes. Comrades still kill each other. I don't know what their intentions are?</p>
<h3>Questions on the "Problem of Literary Heritage"</h3>
<p>— Lin Xiao</p>
<p>"European winds blowing east" seems to have become a cliché, but in reality, there are many things that still require this phrase. For example, nude sports, which originally originated in Germany, soon "blew east." Also, things like doctrines are always imported from foreign countries. Alas, our country is a backward country, and can only follow behind the "civilized country." But following behind is not a big deal. Unfortunately, many things are not very suitable. Borrowing a big hat and putting it on a pointy head, even if it is a fashionable hat, it looks ugly. Recently, the issue of literary heritage has also been imported from foreign countries. Clever people have also begun to seriously discuss it. Their conclusion is: examine, examine, abandon toxic things, and inherit valuable materials. But the conclusion only goes this far. What exactly is China's heritage? What are the toxic things? What are the valuable materials? No one has specifically indicated it. I fundamentally doubt: measuring the past with the current dimensions. The existence of literary works is the existence of historical value. If we use the current rope to put on the heads of the ancients and say which ones should be "promoted" and which ones should be "abandoned," it is simply ridiculous. China has spent many days in the feudal era. It can be said that most of the works have feudal consciousness. If we want to examine the "toxicity" of literary heritage, we will not have any "valuable" heritage to speak of. Take "Chu Ci," for example. In terms of historical value, it exists no matter what. But measuring it with the current dimensions, "Chu Ci" will contain toxic things. It contains the thought of loyalty to the emperor and nostalgia for the master, using fragrant grass and beautiful women to express the sorrow of an exiled official. In the "modern" sense, it is a ridiculous consciousness, except for the likes of Zheng Xiaoxu in Manchukuo who do not need this kind of consciousness. But is "Chu Ci" ultimately considered a great work? I'm afraid no one dares to deny it! Not to mention "Chu Ci," let's take two recognized great literary works, such as Water Margin and Dream of the Red Chamber, which can be used as "valuable" materials. However, Water Margin is said to have an unsound consciousness. For example, Song Jiang, who is described with great effort, only hopes for the court's amnesty. What about Dream of the Red Chamber? The sons and daughters and young ladies' tedious love is nothing but a narration of "trivial matters." These, these, are all toxic things that should be "abandoned" like old shoes. Then what is "promoted"? One can answer directly, nothing! The ancient things, the things of the feudal era, are all toxic. Since the "May Fourth Era," unfortunately, the time has been very short and nothing has been left behind (some say that only the image of Ah Q has been left behind). In this way! If the modern measurers use the standard ruler to measure, aren't the ancestors only leaving behind many stinking skins, causing us to be disappointed again and again?</p>
<p>However: the problem is not like this. I think these mistakes lie in the so-called "re-evaluation." We must know that the progress of history is permanent. Our present is just a moment in the progress of history. For the past literary heritage, we must preserve and analyze it as historical value, as material for studying the past, which is necessary. If we use a momentary stage to estimate the value of permanent history, this ignores the objective existence of historical value.</p>
<p>In short, the value of literary works is historical value. Its value will not be transferred with the "standards" of modern people. The so-called "selection" and "abandonment" of literary heritage do not touch the value of literature itself!</p>
<p>Then, what is the difference between the "accepting heritage" issue and "reorganizing national legacy"?</p>
<p>Fashionable nouns imported from foreign countries, even if they are spoken beautifully, are ultimately just a big hat, making it look even more ugly.</p>
<h3>Wonderful Article Prohibiting Men and Women from Walking Together</h3>
<p>Since Zhang Zhiying, the naval commander of Guangdong Province, and Fan Dexing, the central pacification committee member, proposed separate swimming for men and women, Zheng Ridong, the director of the provincial river and lake distribution bureau, in response to Commander Zhang, recently submitted a petition to the Southwest Political Committee requesting the implementation of a ban on men and women walking together. This kind of authentic domestically produced wonderful article has not been seen for a long time, and his painstaking efforts to maintain morality are commendable and admirable. Even Cheng Zhu resurrected would probably not have such a great theory. Now, the petition is copied below for fellow enthusiasts:</p>
<p>"Firstly, men and women are different; what difference is there between water and land? Since there is a fear that the precautions of etiquette will be diminished, legal prohibitions should also be equally important. I respectfully present my humble opinion, and request your approval. Since the civilization of the world has been poured into China, European winds and American rains have been pressing closer. Our Guangdong has been the first to open up, fearing to lag behind. Women have been liberated, and social interactions have been made public. Giving peonies and picking orchids has spread scandalous news overseas. Giving reeds and offering pipes has spread romantic tales in the city corners. During this transitional period, there may be licentious actions by the two sexes seeking each other. Outsiders point fingers, and this is taken as a concern for the morality and ethics of the world. Thoughts go to extremes, and opinions are difficult to reconcile. Last month, your committee issued an order to prohibit men and women swimming together, which has aroused more social attention. The people's nature is stubborn, aspiring to be sages and worthies. They both hate the new tide and vigorously maintain the ancient rites. I believe that mixed swimming pools should be prohibited, and preventing lewdness on the streets should not be relaxed. In the past, 'men on the right, women on the left' was seen in the articles on roads in the Wang Zhi: 'Having a woman in the same carriage, having a woman walking together' are the songs of Zheng and Wei's licentiousness. Recently, as the world's customs have deteriorated and the people's morals have been corrupted, they compete to imitate fashion, ignoring etiquette and teachings. Golden and beautiful qualities constantly walk on the streets, and delicate figures from embroidered pavilions are accustomed to soaring on the left side of the road. Applying powder and rouge is used as a goal, and exposing arms and feet is used as a carnal temptation, so that wandering bees chase after the scent and licentious butterflies follow the fragrance. Frivolous people often make vows up and down, and careful people also have secret thoughts. They may form illicit relationships in encounters, and each boasts of their unique encounters in the bustling crowd. The ways of integrity and shame are lost, and the pleasure of adultery and abduction is increasing daily. The consequences are endless. Now that the habit of swimming together has also been prohibited, but the harm of walking together has not been heard of as being prevented. I suspect that the clear prohibitions are stricter on the water and looser on the land. In the end, I fear that it will be difficult to fight against the corrupting customs and fail to correct the root and clear the source. Every time I set foot on the street, I see strange sights: strangely dressed women, with hands held and shoulders together, loving couples, passers-by stare, and vulgar people are especially heartbroken. Thinking that bad habits should be eliminated, sighing that who can work together to save the madness, I humbly offer my slight contribution and present my Chen. I implore you to adopt and implement it, and the future of the Party-State will be greatly fortunate. Respectfully presented to the Southwest Political Committee."</p>

<h3>Uncertain Intention</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor:</p>
<p>My grandparents had three sons, the eldest being my father, who passed away twenty-three years ago. My father left behind two unfortunate younger brothers. The elder of the two was adopted by a paternal uncle. My second uncle holds a massive fortune, is now fifty years old, and has no son. However, this April, he adopted a child of unknown parentage and asked several relatives and friends to witness my signing an acknowledgement to ensure the continuation of the family lineage and estate. According to members of the clan, a nephew has the right to an equal share of the property. In this world, who would not seek to acquire wealth? Therefore, I intend to find a way to intervene. However, I am only a primary school graduate, my knowledge is limited, and I do not fully understand legal matters. I fear being deceived by others and dare not act rashly. Thus, I am indecisive, as if lost in a fog. Therefore, I earnestly request the Editor to provide guidance for my good fortune. With respectful regards, Fei Peng bows.</p>
<p>Reply:</p>
<p>The ancestral temple inheritance system has now been abolished. The current civil law regarding inheritance pertains specifically to the allocation of the estate. Under the ancestral temple inheritance system, whoever inherited the ancestral temple also inherited the estate. However, under the current system, the ancestral temple and estate inheritance are two entirely separate matters. In other words, while a nephew may have been qualified to inherit the ancestral temple under the old customs, he has no right to inherit the estate under the current inheritance law, which solely addresses the allocation of the estate. Your uncle has no son, but he now has an adopted son. According to current law, his adopted son has the same rights to inherit the estate as a biological child. Although you are his nephew, you have no right to it. You should no longer entertain wishful thinking about his estate.</p>

<h3>Revenge (4)</h3>
<p>— By Hungarian Julius Baki, Translated by Luo Jia</p>
<p>The girl turned once more toward the doorway beside the corridor.</p>
<p>"Goodbye, my dear, my only one!"</p>
<p>The man closed the door and, as if drunk, turned back into their room. He sat down on the couch. His gaze swept around. Various feelings surged within his soul. Beside the revolver lay a silk woman's garter... He looked at them. After a moment, he stood up and walked to the table. Silk garter and revolver…</p>
<p>A happy smile floated onto his lips. He picked up the garter and the pistol, and then… locked them away in the table drawer. In the center of the count's mansion stood a casket cover. Inside the coffin lay a young life that had passed. A strange smile of the dead lingered on the corners of her lips. Eternal silence sealed them. In front of the casket, with his head bowed in mourning, was the young husband, receiving relatives and friends who came to offer condolences, holding back tears of grief shimmering in his eyes. His heart was filled with unspeakable pain. A man approached him. He looked at him, but strangely, the past hatred had flown from his soul. He wordlessly extended his hand in a gesture of goodwill.</p>
<p>"Look! She is no longer of this world… my faithful wife… everything I hold dear… my Alice…"</p>
<p>The man curiously gazed at the dead woman's face. So beautiful, still seductive even now… He thought, grasped the husband's hand, and said in a trembling voice:</p>
<p>"I am just as grieved... I also..."</p>
<p>From the next room came the sound of a child crying. It was a nursing cry, perhaps calling for its mother, who had only given it two days of life.</p>
<p>Labor is transferred to all righteousness</p>
<p>"My little infant… my little son" (End)</p>

<h3>The Construction of Mass Language and Film</h3>
<p>— Xu Ren</p>
<p>We know that [we must first promote mass language, establish mass language, and then use mass language to educate the masses, popularize education]. Because film has educational and enlightening qualities, how should we establish mass language to [convey anti-imperialist, anti-feudal, and anti-religious ideas to the masses]? First, we must achieve this: current and future films should no longer be made for young masters and mistresses. To quote a passage from [The Death of a Famous Actor], [Now we must let the common people awaken after watching our plays.] In other words, current and future films are to be made for the masses.</p>
<p>Mass language literature should enable the masses to speak, hear, read, and write. Of course, this includes understanding what is seen, hearing clearly, and writing effectively, etc. In the realm of film art, apart from the fact that it is inherently impossible to "write" in the same way, from the perspective of the active development of themes, we must also enable the masses to understand more thoroughly. This is the problem of the unity of form and content. If we look at the subjects of current Chinese films, they are gradually approaching the actual lives of the masses. However, because the language on the screen is separated from the language of the masses' actual lives, the content of the subjects is still not understood by the masses. Although the mechanics of sound film are sophisticated, they can only achieve clear sound and audible speech. Is the Mandarin (which the masses call "official language") used in the dialogue fully understood by the masses aurally? As for silent films, when we think of the subtitles in [Humanity] and the current general use of beautifully written vernacular prose in the style of prose poetry for subtitles, this problem is closely linked to the construction of mass language in literature, and it urgently requires further discussion.</p>
<p>How to construct mass language is an extremely serious problem. I personally believe that the opinions put forward by various individuals in the literary world at present are a powerful aid. When the discussion of the problem progresses to a certain stage, and a certain language suitable for the actual lives of the masses is established, [because film has a more practical experimental effect than literature], we may as well bring that language to the screen and conduct a practical experiment to complete the construction of mass language.</p>
<p>In this way, if the language is understood by the masses, then the content of the film will generally be easily understood by the masses. At that time, even if the rulers try to use mass language as a tool to anesthetize the masses, just as they used the vernacular, because the mass language itself is developing healthily, they will certainly not achieve their goal. Since the masses can understand reality, the kind of content that is not close to the actual lives of the masses will undoubtedly be inevitably rejected by the masses.</p>
<p>Just as the literary world has launched a major offensive against the bastion of the Tongcheng School, we should unite on an anti-imperialist, anti-feudal, and anti-religious battle line, attacking the resurrected positions of films featuring gods, monsters, martial arts, detectives, and romance. Amidst the encirclement of resurrected zombies, we should jointly rebuild the foundation of Chinese culture. This success is not the power of a few, but the result of everyone's efforts.</p>

<h3>Review of [Bathing Beauty]</h3>
<p>— Xun Zhi</p>
<p>Love Never Again Nanjing</p>
<p>German sound films developed three years later than American ones; it was not until 1930 that Germany produced works that could formally compete with American sound films. It is not necessary to say much here about what political and social changes took place in Germany around 1930. What readers should pay attention to is that under such an unfavorable and turbulent social state, and in parallel with the film industry's misfortune of being on the verge of decline, the decline in artistic and ideological aspects also became a prominent characteristic. In German sound films, we can no longer see the works of conscience and art from the silent film era. Apart from one or two small companies that produced one or two serious works around 1931, most have already been controlled by the National Socialist film policy. Therefore, in current German films, [its mission is no longer to elucidate the serious problems of modern society, but to promote optimism to mankind and to make the audience hallucinate that there is still so-called happiness and joy in life]. The prevalence of [Flying Dragons and Dancing Phoenixes] [Rainbow Fairy] (Ronny) and other opera-promoting films has its social basis in this. Infatuation, love, sex appeal, sophistication – its mission is to give those who toil all their lives a temporary respite, dispel their dissatisfaction with reality, and tame them into accepting their circumstances. Except for the blind, it is probably impossible to deny the extant effect of these erotic films.</p>
<p>[Bathing Beauty] is one of these erotic operettas. Sweet fantasies, an excess of sexuality. The male protagonist is a playboy who has no life other than messing around with women and signing checks for them. The female protagonist is a woman who has no other life than competing with men using her sexuality. Checks are signed one after another, for fifty thousand, thirty thousand, without any hesitation. If you are someone who has to worry about life, watching such a film will definitely make you feel like this is [What kind of world is this!].</p>
<p>The director Anatol Litvek has no other merits apart from saving on dialogue and using music. The first half is too long, and the latter half is scattered and trivial. But in editing, you can still see a little of the unique advantages of German films.</p>

<h3>Mae West's Slang Is Based on Shakespeare</h3>
<p>— Xi Fu</p>
<p>Movie stars all have dual personalities. One is the personality expressed on the screen, which is what the audience knows and believes. The other is their true personality, which is their personality in private life. Mae West can be considered the best at distinguishing these two personalities and being careful not to mix them up. This Paramount star wiggles her gourd-shaped body on screen to show lewdness, but she is a very well-behaved person. She never goes out at night to have fun and lose sleep. On screen, she bites on a long ivory cigarette holder and drinks champagne, but in her private life, she does not smoke or drink. She also does not tempt men and lead them into her private room. Not only is her personality completely different on screen and in private life, but she also maintains a special personality when she meets with news reporters because aren't news reporters the medium for conveying the meaning of actions to the general public? When she meets with news reporters, she is full of vulgar slang, but when she speaks to her servants at home or talks with close friends, she never says a word of slang. Her reason is that the public likes her "bad," so she has to pretend to be "bad."</p>
<p>Mae West once smiled and said to a friend: [Do you know who is the oldest ancestor of slang? Who first invented the vulgarism (Do me Wrong)?] The friend could not answer for a moment. Mae then smiled: [It's the great poet Shakespeare.] The friend was stunned and puzzled: [Shakespeare? Where did he say such a thing?] Mae said: [Of course, it's Shakespeare. If you don't believe me, go check it out, and you'll know. As far as I know, Shakespeare is the oldest ancestor of slang!]</p>
<h3>Their Shared Suffering</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>Once, two foreign stars were deeply discussing a problem. One was French male star Maurice Chevalier; the other was German star Marlene Dietrich. A mischievous person eavesdropped. Do you know what they were discussing? It turned out that they were discussing that they had lived in Hollywood for too long and would soon lose their native accents. Maurice said: [If I don't use a French accent to speak English, I can't get any fun out of it. But my French accent has gradually been lost, and the effect of deliberately faking a French accent is not even one-tenth as good as a real French accent.] As he said this, Marlene nodded silently and sighed, expressing infinite sympathy and regret. But people who don't know often see them falling in love, but because of the age-old feud between Germany and France, they have encountered obstacles!</p>
<h3>Hollywood Socialists</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>Do you know how many of the Hollywood stars are inclined to new socialism? Although the exact number is unknown, according to investigations, there are many. Among these people, there are several who admit to supporting socialism and are not shy about it. The first is James Cagney. He supports socialism to the extent that he also supports communism. He often advocates liberating mankind from poverty and suffering. There is also Warren William. He often says [It is a sin that cannot be faced up to heaven or down to people. Why do some people have yachts and Rolls-Royces, while others don't even have enough food and clothing? There is absolutely no reason for this, but under the current clumsy economic system, they are sacrificed for no reason.] Lee Tracy often says angrily: [People are too selfish and self-interested. They see wealth and poverty coexisting and don't think about using a rational and well-planned economic policy to reform the status quo, so that the rich will not lose their comfort, and the poor will not have to cry out in hunger.]</p>
<p>The average Hollywood star enjoys a salary of several thousand dollars a week, and their income is truly considerable. So once they become stars, they sign a contract today, and tomorrow they have all the houses, cars, villas, and gardens. It is, of course, the most pleasant thing in the world and something that millions of unfortunates cannot hope to achieve. But I wonder what these supporters of socialism have done to benefit the poor?</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3>Thirty Day Princess (6)</h3>
<p>— Jin Que</p>
<p>At this time, there was a sudden commotion outside. In a moment, Gilke actually pushed aside the guards and rushed in, followed by two people, one was that bastard Spotswood, and one was the silly Duke Nicholas. Madison immediately scolded Gilke angrily: [What is this!] Gilke said loudly: [Don't you know? He pointed at the princess and said: [Look. She is not some princess! She is Irene Nash, the missing woman! I can now prove her...] Spotswood! Pull back that curtain!] Spotswood, on receiving the order, immediately stepped forward and pulled back a curtain... Inside, a person was standing... That was the King of Toronia, Anatole II! He shouted at Gretchen: [My daughter is over there!] The princess said: [Papa, I'm here ××××××××××] She said a long string of Toronian language.] Sue Sue!] Anatole shouted wildly. [Sue Sue, my Sue Sue!] Gilke saw that the situation was not right and shouted to Spotswood: [Run! Run! Why aren't you running?] So they fled in panic. Nicholas stood at the door in a silly daze. He opened his mouth wide and couldn't close it for a moment. Anatole turned around and said to him: [××××××××××] Probably scolding him in the Toronian dialect! Sue Sue took this opportunity to act spoiled towards her father: [Papa, of course I can never marry Nicholas again. Look how badly he messed things up. He's so stupid that he doesn't even recognize me! I know his mistakes, but, Papa, you don't need to be angry with him.] The princess said to Madison: [Please wait inside that curtain for a while.] As she said this, she couldn't help but put her hand to her mouth and laugh to herself.</p>
<p>Madison quickly replied [Yes...yes...Miss...] As she said this, she retreated behind the curtain. There was no one else behind that curtain, only Nash was waiting, wearing her own original clothes, with a brand new check, given to her by Gray, tucked into her corsage. When she saw Madison come in, she shouted: [Hello...Hello...Darling! (meaning sweetheart)] Madison was stunned by her shout. Wasn't he just separating from her at the dance hall? How could she be here again? After thinking about it, he suddenly realized: [Oh, so Gilke was right. You are a fraud! You are an imposter!] Nash wasn't angry at all when she heard him scolding her. She wasn't going to explain anything. She knew that there would be plenty of time to explain later. She still had many years to tell! She was looking forward to those years! So she shouted again: [Hello...Hello...Darling!] Her eyes were mocking him. She pursed her small mouth, containing infinite unspeakable affection. In a moment, Madison couldn't be angry anymore. Wasn't this the woman he sincerely loved? Did she have to be a princess to be loved? So he picked her up. He kissed her... kissed her... (End)</p>
