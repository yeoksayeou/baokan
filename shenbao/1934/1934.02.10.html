<h3>蘇匃恢復邦交·華</h3>
<p>據外電匃牙利與蘇聯之恢復邦交條約。已於二月六日在羅馬之蘇聯駐</p>
<p>意大使館内。正式簽字成立。從此蘇匃兩國間之正常外交關係得以回復而中歐方面各小恊約諸國似亦將於最近期内。有步匃後塵繼續與蘇聯締約。成立正常外交關係之可能。吾人試以此與最近中歐各國外交方面之變化。如德波互不侵犯條約之訂立。德奥兩國之衝突。與正在進行中之奥匃談話。併列參觀。則知匃蘇之接近。非但爲蘇聯包圍德國計劃之成立。抑卽爲德法衝突與德意爭衡兩重關係日益尖鋭之開端。彼蘇聯者正在高瞻遠矚。周旋於各國之間縱橫捭闔包舉全歐冀使彼反蘇前衛之希特拉受制於中歐諸國而不得越多腦河一步。其外交之手。段可謂靈敏。而此後歐洲外交關係之動向如何世界和平之變化如何。均與此有密切之關係。世人能忽視之乎。</p>
<p>匃牙利乃昔日奥匃帝國分裂後之新邦。地積不滿四萬方英里。人口不逾九百萬但以地處多腦河流域之中心。肥沃宜農。工業發達。以市塲關係而論。與奥捷羅猶諸國同爲歐洲諸大國逐鹿爭雄之目標。而尤爲德國所注意。蓋自凡爾塞和約成立而後。多腦河富源卽爲他人爼上之肉。此於德國資本主義之發展爲一絕大之致命傷。戰後十年。受人束縛　。而不得一逞者此耳。希特拉就任之後。乃竭力使其黨徒運用於中歐各國。冀建立多數之與國。以創造其同系之政權。事實上卽欲囊括中歐。恢复舊國。然後憑此以問鼎於全歐。其計可謂偉大矣。希特拉於本年一月間。曾向波蘭締結十年互不侵犯條約。以德波之積年糾紛。而希特拉乃能盡量忍受。吾人卽早知其别有懷抱。消極的爲安定東方鄰國。積極的爲南向以侵中歐。果也不崇朝而有奥國境内國社黨徒圖奪政權之表示。卒致奥總理杜爾斐斯。不得不起而訴諸國聯。希特拉之雄圖壯志。固可驚異。然而他人所以應付之手段如蘇聯者。巧妙更在希特拉之上也。</p>
<p>希特拉之積極侵入中歐。一方面爲法蘭西所深惡痛絕。他方面尤爲意大利所憂慮。故法則以小恊約與四國公約。操縱中歐與巴爾幹各國。意則以親奥而結歡匃捷諸邦。皆所以制希拉於多腦河流域内勢力之擴張。蘇聯乘之適構成一包圍德國之强固陣綫。匃蘇復交而後。此種形勢之發展。尤爲鮮明。蓋自李維諾夫自美返國道經羅馬之際。識者早知其心於反德計劃。有所佈置。德波互不侵犯條約告成而後。更知中歐外交關係。將愈見緊張。彼希特拉對此實逼處此之情勢下。將舉全力以向中歐圖更進一步之計劃歟。抑别於歐洲而外。締建强大之與國。以突破此包圍歟。此則甚堪注意之一問題也。</p>

<h3>各黨願爲後援</h3>
<p>國際聞名之法國政治家均允爲杜氏後盾、衆院中之急進黨亦請赫禮歐向杜氏聲明願予贊助、但急進黨之態度、非俟開會决定後、殊不可恃也、</p>
<h3>愼遴財長一席</h3>
<p>昨夜據可靠方面傳出消息、杜氏已放棄羅致以前諸總理組織新閣之主意、亦不欲組織（外乎國會）之政府、杜氏鑒於預算案之不穩固、爲前數任内閣失敗總因之一、故已邀著名財政長嘗掌揆席與長財部之凱樂氏會商、凱氏亦七十老翁也、</p>
<h3>儼如大將奏凱</h3>
<p>杜邁格拜命組閣後、各方面皆認爲已挽回革命之可能、杜氏昨與總統勒勃倫會晤十五分之久、略述其計畫、繼卽開始工作、維時有大批工人正在各街道清除前兩日内暴動者所遺棄之各種紀念物、杜氏赴總統府與外交部之一路、其景狀儼如大將奏凱而歸、見者均向歡呼致敬、午後杜與達拉第會談多時達於新閣未成立前、名義上仍爲總理也、</p>
<p>達拉第於杜邁格抵京之前、曾促請總統勒勃倫宜布戒嚴、但遭拒絕、</p>

<h3>交通部籌備國際無線電話</h3>
<p>已與英美法德試話成績良好</p>
<p>成功後將購機舉行正式通話</p>
<p>華東社云、交通部自中英無綫電直接通報成功後、復爲謀更進一步之便利起見、乃籌備與歐洲各國實行互通無綫電話、刻正在試話中、已與德國·美國·英國·等分别試話、成績甚佳、現再擬作長期之試話、待成功後、再向外國購買無綫電機一座、專與各國實行正式通話、</p>
<h3>各國試話</h3>
<p>中央國際無綫電直接通報後、交部卽令國際電信局、於中英通報之餘暇、仍假中英電台、舉行互通無綫電話、使數千里外、能聆清晰之語言、此事經該局之努力進行、已能通話、成績甚佳、最初、該局於中英電台上、與德國柏林之無綫電台試話、雙方各出以清晰温緩之德語、嗣再由駐德公使劉崇傑、與招商局總理劉鴻生、互談甚久、前日、該台又邀本市西門子洋行德人瑞脱、與德國柏林、舉行通話、於柏林電台轉接至離柏林五百里外之小城Ｄｕｓｓｑｆｄｏｒｔ、亦能獲良好之聲浪、宛在目前、該台得斯成績後、復向英國之倫敦、美國之紐約、舉行通話、成績、均佳、刻又擬與法京巴黎、實行通話、</p>
<h3>繼續研究</h3>
<p>國際電信局、自與各國試話成功後、認爲此次通話、成績雖佳、而尙未有十分把握、故仍繼續研究、並擬再假中英無綫電台、與各國再作試話、惟日來該台營業甚忙、極少空閒時刻、故每星期中</p>
<p>、祗能舉行試話數小時、因之何日能完全成功、尙難决定、</p>
<h3>購通話機</h3>
<p>該局與各國舉行無綫電試話成功後、卽將正式接受商電、同時因現在機件甚忙、不能分出餘時、接發電話、故擬於最近之將來、向外國另購無綫電機一座、專爲與各國通話之用、他日成功、吾人卽可於數千里外、與相識之人、一通欵曲也、</p>

<p>央核示後、方可實行、故外傳之説、殊非確詞云、</p>

<h3>辭書的用處</h3>
<p>有學問的人不一定是他能（記得）很多的術語、專門名詞，並（懂得）它們的意義，主要的是他能（找得）它們的出處，和它們的意義。因爲讀書並非專重記憶，能理解纔是要着。而且，單記熟了許多名詞，術語，儘管他是記得多麽多，多麽廣博，實際上也並無多大用處，任何最不完備的辭書，都要比他强得多。人的記憶終究是有限的。然而讀書遇到了這些東西，不能了解，不但是一椿憾事，而且於讀書之理解也極有妨礙。因此，（多記）術語的意義，固無大必要（然而重要的名詞和其意義是須知道的），（會找）却是必需的。</p>
<p>要是瞭（術語）的意義，唯一的辦法是翻辭書　。近來我國文化事業，雖與西洋的標準相差仍很遠，但較前數年確已有了長足的進步。單就辭書一端而論，近年來已出版了好多種，雖然其中編輯精審的尙少，然而，有了壞辭書是總勝於無辭書的。來函所説在辭書上找不到，這並不是（用翻辭典手段）的不對，除了翻辭典，還有什麽是最好的辦法呢？你固然缺乏師友，就是你有許多很有學問的朋友，你也知道，這不是（一二師友）所能完全解答的。但是你的困難何以發生呢？大槪你所用的辭書太不詳博了。譬如辭源這書，它包羅的門類極廣，但他的卷帙却有限，如此它還那裏能把一切過去的現在的術語，都包括進去呢？他祇能揀重要的列入，而且他偏重於（古典），近代的術語包括得很少。但是辭書之爲用，是我們想找什麽随時都能找到，所以我們選擇辭書的標凖，倒不是辭書門類包括得多不多，而是它所包括的門類中搜羅的詞句是否廣博；門類多不多是次要問題。所以你可照你所讀的科目，購備該科目的辭書，一般的辭書那不必多買。</p>
<p>如果你受看小説，文藝，那這一方面的辭書有文學辭典，新文藝辭典及新文藝描寫辭典······等　。讀經濟學則有（經濟學辭典）（柯相年編）。但是照你的來信，似乎你倒非研究某學科時對於名詞的不懂，而是隨便閲讀，遇到了許多術語不能了解，所以你似乎仍需要一個門類較廣而所收之字係常用的辭典，這樣李鼎聲編的（現代語辭典）及新術語詞典（柯柏年等編）於你頗有益處，這兩本書搜羅尙廣。文字亦精晰但有許多解釋頗欠精審，所以低可拿它當參考用。若把它的解釋當做定義看却是萬萬不可的。</p>
<p>如你所遇到的術語，你各處都找不到解釋，可函致本部，我們當盡可能地代找出處和其解釋。　　　　　　　　　　　ㄧ康</p>

<h3>三角實力觀</h3>
<p>上海　上海埠際隊之實力、竟出乎意料之外、在最近之一星期中、大起變化、東華會不滿意西聯會之措置、入選球員戴麟經周賢言等五人拒絕出塲二次埠際試賽、遂致全體落選、華人僅孫錦順等三人、一海隊之實力、當然大受打擊、目前不得已而成之陣線、除中綫可以滿意及後衛尙屬可靠外、守門福祿壽傷後之能否出塲、尙爲問題、卽使登塲、不過第二流角色、前鋒射門人材不多、上海對天津以華特充左翼、甚爲勉强、與津港相較、似屬不如也、</p>
<p>香港　香港亦分兩隊對付滬津、對天津之陣線似不如對上海之堅强、中線後衛前鋒皆佳、惜守門不甚高明耳、據謂麥哈地僅爲第三流人物、如果包家平能來、則可無後顧之憂、希望更厚也、大小告山奴之出席埠際賽、此已爲第八次、將來與譚江柏或鄭季良之合作、大有可觀也、</p>

<p>同濟勝飛霞（甲二）三八比三四</p>
<p>大同勝青光（甲二）四四比四三</p>
<p>章華勝持志（甲二）六二比三九</p>
<p>昨晚　三塲上海籃球會甲二組比賽、其中以青光對大同一塲、最爲發噱、大同一路領前、頗爲順利、上半時以二十四比十六勝、下半時青光奮起、分數大增、似有後來居上之勢、最後张錦祥之兩中、成四十三比四十四、青光僅落後一分、斯時尙餘二十餘秒鐘、談達鏵得球卽射、球雖未中、但對方犯規、連罰兩次、談之罰球、素稱拿手、不料初擲未中、再投亦告彈出、中鋒徐沛然獨得二十五分、厥功不小、</p>
<p>同濟　與飛霞、彼此彼此、可稱難兄難弟兩隊競爭形勢、異常平均、表演則未、見精彩、上半時飛霞以十六比十導前、下半時同濟反勝十分、結果同濟遂以三十八比三十四勝、</p>
<p>章華　對持志、上半時比數雖甚接近、然持志决非敵、雖然極力掙扎、一邊仍寫寫意意、蓋比數之大小、全操縱於章華高興與否、起初曾成十二比十二、上半時成二十八比十八、下半時前十分鐘、仍在平淡中過去、厥後章華工作稍形吃緊、以六十二比三十九勝、</p>

<h3>史密斯將在西青表演撃彈絕技</h3>
<p>十五晚排定兩塲</p>
<p>李公頴再作陪客</p>
<p>世界職業擊彈名家威利史密斯此次來滬觀光、乘便在聯華總會繼續舉行四日八次表演、昨已終了、西青會擊彈主席委員滿洛君、特約其在該會表演、並請我國彈王李公頴參加、藉以發揚藝術、而資提倡、日期在十五日下午六時及晚九時一刻兩塲、今日起該會開始發售入座劵、藍座位有限、恐臨時遭閉門羹也、</p>
<h3>不虚此行</h3>
<p>史密斯在世界職業擊彈舞臺上、以全能著稱、此番第一次來滬、慕名前往欣賞其藝術日夕外百餘人、本市吳市長·俞秘書長·潘局長·林康侯·馬蔭良等、亦均先後作座上客、觀覽之餘、莫不贊嘆、深以此種技藝、在國内確屬罕見、而有提倡之必要、至一般中西擊彈家、關懐尤甚、於其握棒之法、運用之道、全神貫注、以求其理、是則史密斯之來、其有造於上海擊彈界必矣、史密斯可謂不虚此行、</p>
<h3>拿手絕技</h3>
<p>四日八次表演、顯然昭示於我人者、乃其餘各種擊法、無所不精、稱之全能、名符其實其自認最爲擅長者、乃預引敵彈於紅彈本位點之左右、一槍送紅、彈落而本彈亦滾在其旁、成三角式、然後開騰、送紅、互相循環、用力省、得分易、六七○點之上海新紀錄、亦由是告成、</p>
<h3>公頴獨佳</h3>
<p>上海方面被選出席表演者、李公頴（三次）劉富宗、徐世璋、康卜斯、博脱、美迪那（以上各一次）等、就其技藝上所表示、李公頴最孚衆望、當世界名家之前、展其抱懷、態度鎭靜、成績佳妙、難能可貴、其餘諸君、亦尙能努力從專、瑜瑕互見、惟昨晚美迪那打來、頗不如意、平日表演、可與公頴並駕齊驅、昨晚竟全失常態、</p>
<h3>昨賽經過</h3>
<p>昨日第一塲對博脱、共計二十七槍、史密斯得、一零零八點、平均三七點强、博脱得一三一點、平均約五點、第二塲對美迪那、共計二十槍、史密斯得一一六三點、平均五十八點强、美迪那十九槍得一零零點、平均五點强、全日最</p>

<h3>人與人材</h3>
<p>— 醇竹</p>
<p>在一天内，發現了兩件事|兩件絕對矛盾的事。</p>
<p>上半天，有一個姓彭的朋友來看我。他是敎育界人物，因而談起了吳縣敎育界的情形。他説：吳縣敎育，不能算落伍，而敎員的擁擠，却出乎意外，僅在敎育局登記而沒有工作的，已有七百多人。這裏頭，正途師範出身的，不過三之一。其餘各種學堂，甚至大學生，留學生，都有。因爲沒有出路的願故，都肯來附就這冷板凳生活。</p>
<p>我不覺咋舌道：這眞可以稱得起人才濟濟。可惜養成了這許多人材，都埋沒了。可憐可憐！</p>
<p>下半天，又有一個幹化學工業的朋友來看我。他説道：我們廠裏，現在要聘一個對於化學工業，有專門研究的人。素知先生交游委廣，請代爲物色。</p>
<p>我正有上半天這件事情，擱在心裏。不由笑道；蘇州人材這樣多，像貴廠這樣地位，（一二萬資本的中等廠家）難道就弄不到一個相當的人嗎？究竟不是要什麽特别了不得的人物呀。</p>
<p>朋友笑道：不瞞你説，我們早已登報徵求過。應徵的人，倒着實不少，工業專門畢業的也很多。我們把認爲合格的幾十人，分别請來一談，不是茫無頭緒，便是説幾句空話。要能親自動手眞幹的，絕對沒有。不是我們小覻人，舶來品的碩士博士，我們請不起，請得起的國産人材，又不合用。縱有，也都去當了什麽技正，技士，而不屑到廠家來吃苦的。否則何必來託你呢。</p>
<p>我笑道：如此説來，我也祗好敬謝不敏。因爲像你説的這樣人，我眼裏還沒見到過。</p>
<p>朋友走後，害我發了半天不相干的牢騷。據説：造就一個留學生，要十萬元，造就一個小</p>
<p>學生，要一百元。從前清廢科舉設學堂到現在，這三十多年，不知化了多少錢。而所造就的，僅僅是許多（人），而不是（人材）。所以一方面喊着（人浮於事），而一方面還感到（人材缺乏）。</p>
<p>是誰造成這兩個矛盾現象呢？大槪幾十年來主持敎育的當局，和領導敎育的名人，都要負一些責任吧？|尤其是三天一個主義，五天一個方法，把學生當試騐品的朋友。</p>
<h3>廢歷過年雜談</h3>
<p>— 曹文海</p>
<p>民國肇造，已二十三年於茲，官廳雖早已採用國歷，報紙亦改換國歷之日期，而民間則仍習用舊歷，積習相沿，牢不可破。前年國民政府通令全國，採用國歷，將陰歷廢除，各級黨部，一度擴大宣傳，其後政府更諄諄告誡，不啻三令五申。然觀近日民間一切舉動，依然一片過年影象，市上各糕糰舖之年糕，南貨店之瓜子花生，茶食糖果店，及肉莊水果行等，其門市生意，異常忙碌；公館中之太太奶奶，娘姨大姐，及各商店之出店司務等，終日奔波，不絕於途，可見尊重年節之一斑。</p>
<p>邇日夜間，各店舖及富有之家，更有（謝年）之舉，供灶君神馬祭以全猪全羊，大事舖張，通宵達旦，鑼鼓喧天，爆竹乒乓，擾人清夢。每逢斯時，爲（謝年）而燃放爆竹，火星高升，散落屋頂，釀成火災者，在所難免。遭其殃者，大都貧苦之家。時值朔風凛凛，棲身之所被焚，以致饑寒交迫，亦樂極生悲之事也。</p>
<p>走入南市城隍廟，見貨攤林立，宛如露天商塲。近日生意之最佳者，首推畫張月份牌，花攤上之水仙，蘭花，臘梅，天竹枝，又兒童玩具店爆竹店等，亦莫不利市三倍。</p>
<p>及至廢歷元旦，爲尊長者，往往以銀元分贈幼輩，名曰（壓歲錢）一般無知兒童，以此購糖菓，學賭博，爲無意識之消耗，殊爲可惜！當此兒童年，爲父母者，應將子女之（壓歲錢，）代爲儲蓄，積少成多，豈非造福兒童之事耶？</p>
<p>上述數事，亘千百年牢不可破之陋習，無知愚民，固不足深責，獨自命爲知識階級者，亦復隨俗浮沈，不作除舊佈新之念，爲移風易俗之計，實吾人所不解者也。</p>
<h3>譚墓紀游</h3>
<p>— 程志政</p>
<p>大槪凡是到過首都的人，總要去瞻仰總理的陵寢，的確，在巍峨的紫金山下，總理陵墓自然是唯一可稱壯麗的建築物，可是，除了中山墓以外，我覺得還有一個更幽雅，更靜美的譚墓。</p>
<p>譚墓，就是故行政院長譚延闓的墳墓，它在中山墓右約三里路，也就在靈谷寺的後面，今年偶然因爲有事到南京，朋友們在陪我玩過照例的中山陵，明陵，五洲公園之後，又談起新近完工的譚墓如何雅致，於是我們决定去瞻仰瞻仰。</p>
<p>出了中山門約莫七八里，車子在靈谷寺門前停下了。靈谷寺雖然現在成爲要人的消閒勝地，然而進去一看，祇是一個很平凡的廟宇。譚墓，就緊隣着它，也許因爲譚院長生前常到這裏的緣故吧！</p>
<p>墓的入口，有一個巨大的石碑，寫着譚院長國葬之碑。是那時國民政府主席蔣介石具名的。向前進，一路是碎石坦道，兩旁長着权枒的古樹。漸漸的登山了，在面前便豁露了一座紀念堂，紀念堂是純粹的宮殿式，畫樑彫棟，美麗悦目。裏面正中是譚院長的遺像。四壁懸着各要人的輓聯。桌上是銀盾銀屏，尤是可觀的，是幾對瓷瓶，高約四五尺，陳設得十分精巧。</p>
<p>紀念堂祇有一間，出了紀念堂，四面找墳墓，却是找不到。我以爲也許墓就在紀念堂下面，但是想來又不致於如此簡單。朋友們領着我再上山，轉了幾個灣，譚墓果然到了。墓是用水門汀砌成的，墓前用白石彫成有闉案的階級。兩旁各有一所小亭，也是宮殿式。沿入口處一直到墓前，都是一盆一盆的鮮花。</p>
<p>墓是紫金山的半腰了，望着中山陵和明陵，正是遙相犄角。林木蒼窮，泉聲潺潺，好一個幽靜的長眠之地呀！</p>
<p>坐了一會，循着原徑下山，在紀念堂的旁邊，又發現了一個紀念園。這園是湖南省政府贈送的，因爲譚院長是湖南人，那時湘省當局又是受譚院長知遇最深的舊部，所以這個紀念園裏也建築得十分精巧，除了花卉樹木之外，有亭有廳，有泉水，有小橋，還有稱頌功德的紀念碑文，可知譚院長死後感人之深了。</p>
<p>我游罷了譚墓，覺得中山陵誠然是壯闊，但是一望無餘，沒有曲折，譚墓雖小，而地幽勢阻，饒有變化，從國葬碑進去，到墓地爲止，足足有半里路，若隱匿現，幾度盤旋，大槪設計的工程師很費了一番苦心了。</p>
<p>未了，我希望以後觀光首都的游客，千萬不要遺忘了這個好去處|譚院長墓。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十四回</p>
<p>酌酒傳餐狂歡含别淚</p>
<p>挑燈温夢低唱度長更</p>
<p>自强不在意的答道：可不是，大槪再過半個月，口外也許就下雪了。趙翁聽了這話，不覺心裏跳了幾下，立刻連想着，若是打起仗來，又怎麽辦？於是閉上眼睛，裝成一個凝神想什麽的樣子，同時那要滾出來的兩粒眼淚，也就閉在眼睛裏，不曾出來了。自强不敢坐在這裏了，口裏説着去清理東西，也回房躺下了。到了吃晚飯的時候，桂枝把自强牽着到堂屋裏來，只見桌子正中擺下四個大碟子，是香腸油鷄之類，桌子斜對角，放了兩大盤餡餅，下方明晃晃地點了一盞白罩煤油燈，還有一把錫酒壺。桂枝自坐了下方，指着左手空椅子道：你坐下。趙自强見另二方父親同岳母坐下了，便笑道：桌子朝中一擺，四方坐着四個人，倒好像是一桌席面。桂枝提起酒壺來，向左方空杯子裏斟下酒去，笑道：古言道得好，物輕人意重，千里送鵝毛。這雖是兩大盤子餡餅的酒席，可是我這番情意不錯，你應當做魚翅燕窩的酒席一樣來吃。你贊成我這話，就先乾上一杯。趙自强更不打話端起酒杯子來，咕嘟一聲喝乾，還舉着照了一照杯。江氏手扶着筷子，笑道：我們姑奶奶，今天透着更會説話。桂枝笑道：這就算會説話了嗎？我還打算和他談一宿呢。口裏説着，手上的酒壺，已經伸到自强面前來。自强兩手捧了杯子接着他的酒，笑道：我得回敬你一杯吧？桂枝將酒地壺向懷裏一摟，笑道：别，今天是我替你送行，留着我到遷安去，你替我接風再喝罷。（三一三）</p>

<h3>眞空管發達之沿革</h3>
<p>— 一知</p>
<p>前言</p>
<p>無綫電自發明成工以來，迄今僅有三十餘年，而能得此突飛猛進之現象，則應歸功於無線電靈魂之眞空管。溯自英人佛來銘氏（Ｆｌθｍｉｎｇ）創二極管以來，曾幾何時，而四極管，五極管，七極管，交流式，無燈絲式等，層見疊出，不下百餘種　，眞空管旣如此繁多，故其特性亦益複雜，若欲將（眞空管發達之沿革），詳實紀述，必爲本刋狹小篇輻所不許，故祇擇其較爲重要者，分類略述於后。</p>
<p>二極管|三極管</p>
<p>１８８４年愛迪生氏將其發明之眞空電泡中，加裝一極，發見有電流現象，當時學者不能解釋其理由，稱之曰（愛迪生效用）（Ｅｄｉｓｏｎ　Ｅｆｆθｃｔ）至１８８６年，英人佛來銘氏應用愛氏現象製成二極管（Ｄｉｏｄθ），以作檢波之整流工作。１８８９年湯姆生與李却生二氏（Ｔｈｏｍｓｏｎ　ａｎｄＲｉｃｈａｒｄｃｓｏｎ）以電子學説解釋眞空管作用原理，謂燈絲受熱，蒸發電子，遂爲荷正電之屏極吸引，而成愛氏現象。１９０７年美人狄福來斯氏（ＤθＦｏｒθｓｔ）在二極管中絲極與屏極間加一金屬網製成之栅極，效率大增，乃創三極管（Ｔｒｉｏｄｅ），１９１５年美國倫密諾氏（Ｌｏｎｇｍｉｍ）將狄氏之軟性三極管，使眞空度加增，成爲硬性三極管，至此時三極管已達發達之期，可用作振盪，調幅，檢波及放大之用。</p>
<p>四極管|五極管</p>
<p>三極管用於射電週率放大，因其極間容量之大及有電子反射作用，易起振盪，而加增雜聲，因此遂有德人司靠蓋氏（Ｓｃｈｏｔｔｋｙ）美人霍兒氏（Ａ·Ｗ·Ｈｕｌｌ）發明四極管（Ｔｅｔｒｏｄｅ）如ＵＸ·２２其構造卽在三極管之栅屏間，再加一栅極，名·曰栅極（Ｓｃｒθθｎ　Ｇｒｉｄ）此管眞出於意想之外，射電週率放大之高，極間電容量之小，靈敏度及選擇性之佳，遠勝於三極管多矣，惟此管因特性所限，祇能用於射電週率放大，復有研究家在此四極管这簾橺極與屏極間，加一栅極，接於陰極，以防電子之二次發射現象（Ｓθｃｏｎｄａｒｙ　Ｅｍｉｓｉｏｎ）於是屏流大增，輸出電力甚大，在成音週率上作爲放大之用，最爲合宜，卽名曰强力五極管（Ｐｏｗｅｒ　Ｐθｎｔｏｄθ）如２４７管。</p>
<p>交流管|直熱式，傍熱式，速熱式無綫電話旣日趨發達，收音機之眞空管若用乾電池或蓄電池供給，旣不經濟又覺換電手續麻煩，乃復有交流管之産生。始僅有直熱式一種，將三極管之燈絲電阻减低以减少交流聲，如ＵＸ-2２６等，復改良創一種傍熱式（Ｉｎｄｉｒｅｃｔｈｅａｔ　ｔｙｐｅ）使絲極與陰極隔離，絲極專作發熱之用，陰極專作發射之用，如Ｕｙ-227等·此管交流聲甚爲低微，惟絲極須經絕緣體傳至陰極，故該式眞空管動作甚爲遲緩·因此又加改良，以絕綠體穿空，使陰極能得由絲極發出之幅射熱，動作乃可較速，稱爲速熱式（Ｆａｓｔｅｒ　Ｈｅａｔｅｒ　Ｔｙｐｅ）如新式２２７-224-Ａ等。</p>
<p>雙栅三極管|雙孿三極管，雙屏三極管，雙屏五極管|七極管</p>
<p>普通三極管，若輸入訊號電壓過高，卽致失眞，故有雙栅三極管（ＤｏｕｂｌｅＧｒｉｄ　Ｔｒｉｏｄｅ）發明·如４６管輸入訊號可較平常三極管增大一倍又依推挽式乙類放大之原理，將兩只三極管置在一管中名曰雙孿三極管（ＴｗｉｎＴｒｊｃｄｅ）如２Ｂ６管·爲免綫路之日趨複雜，將一管作爲來回數用，如檢波，放大及音量調節，或射電週率放大，中間週率放大，振盪等·乃製成雙屏三極管Ｄｉｏｄｅ　Ｔｒｉｏｄｅ如５５·８５管等·雙屏五極管Ｄｉｏｄｅ　ｐｅｎｔｏｄｅ如２Ｂ７·６Ｂ等·又有七極管Ｈｅｐｔｏｄｅ·如２Ａ	７·６Ａ７等·</p>
<p>特種眞空管</p>
<p>空管Ｃａｔｋｉｎ及ＩＩＯＶ高壓管	Ｈｉｇｈ　ｔｅｎｓｉｏｎ　ｔｕｂｅ製造，</p>
<p>美國又創一種無燈絲式管（Ｆｉｌａｍｅｎｔｌｅｓｓｔｕｂθ）更因無綫電影與超短波之研究突飛猛進·有陰極綫電視管Ｃａｔｈｏｄｅ　Ｒａｙｔθｌｖｉｓｊｏｎ　ｔｕｂｅ及鞋紐管　Ｓｈｏｅ　ｂｕｔｔｏｎｕｂｅ等發明·</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>眞空管至今，已有登峯造極之象，然歐美研究家仍孜孜研究·雖吾人不能推測以後發展如何，然依目前情形而觀，恐眞空管内部日趨複雜，一管必使有來回數循環之用，將較今最新式２Ａ７·２Ｂ７管更有效也。</p>
<h3>檢波用眞空管</h3>
<p>— 高崇齡</p>
<p>收音機中司檢波作用的機件可分爲兩類：一卽礦石機中的礦石，其二則爲眞空管。</p>
<p>檢波用眞空管（Ｔｕｂｅ　ａｓｄｏｔθｃｔｏｒ），在眞空管收音機中實爲一個不可缺少的機件，一如礦石機中的礦石，每個收音機中至少須要有一個檢波的眞空管，無極外差式的收音機且分有第一與第二檢波眞空管。例如最簡單的一體收音機的眞空管卽爲檢波管，二燈收音機爲檢波管與低周率放大管，三燈機中則有高週率放大管，檢波管，及低週率放大管等。（待續）</p>
<h3>内外消息</h3>
<p>天耳無綫電公司營業之一斑，天耳公司素以修理無綫電著名，凡收音機一切疑難問題，無不着手成春，良因該公司有專門人才之效果也。該公司經理莊君智鴻，於特長修理收音機之外，於修理有聲電影機，更具心得。聞昨日某大影戲院之機器，忽然不響，屢經滬上西人名技師修理，未能恢復原狀，後由莊君修理，於二小時内完畢，發音更勝當初。該公司技術精巧，於此可見一斑。國人有收音機而需修理者，固不妨一試也。</p>
<p>鷹皇牌廠長惠立姆氏云，在上星期中，因廠中營業發達，舊有工人，不敷應用，故增加新工人六百名，現該廠雇用工人，已超出二千六百名以上，且仍有不敷應用之勢，故在最近期内，再將加雇工人云。</p>
<p>德國之廣播日：最近德國之廣播無綫電規定一廣播日，希望舉國之人在此日各購一收音機，以收聽此日政府對於國民之廣播，凡未購置收音機之鄉下農民則可到購有收音機之處借聽，以冀全德國國民，均能收聽此日之廣播云。</p>

<h3>年關</h3>
<p>— 樊仲雲</p>
<p>過了新曆年，又是舊曆年。過年之在我們窮人，確實是個不小的難關，稱曰（年關），眞是名副其實。</p>
<p>年關旣到，債務齊來，妙手空空，大不易過：一也。還有，新年將臨，欣逢佳節，家庭親友之間，少不了應時的點綴與應酬，然而阮囊羞澀，奈何！奈何！此時，夜深人靜，聽着四處的爆竹聲，好像一聲聲都打着心頭，屈指歲除，不過數一天，然而這樣的光陰，眞不啻度日如年呢。</p>
<p>最難堪者，從前只有舊曆年，現在加上新曆年，於是我們每年得過兩重的年關。新曆年底，商店往來，銀行透支，都須結算清楚。然而新的活動，却須待至舊曆年關以後。於是在這新舊年關之間，我們遂如涸轍之魚，只好困頓以死。我們今日好像伍子胥過昭關，過了一關又一關，旣中心之如焚，遂不覺兩鬢忽已斑了。</p>
<p>處在新舊之交的我們，這是必然的運命羆。因爲這樣的現象，不止過年一端，其他種種，莫不如此。</p>
<p>有許多人，爲了整潔與利便，改衣西服，然而回到家中，却又感到中國衣服之舒適，於是服裝照例得中西俱備，布鞋革履不得不同時普置。</p>
<p>還有家庭之中，舊式女子，雖能治家，却不擅交際，而新式女子，則雖酬酢應對，極交際的能事，却不善治家。於是爲之夫者，爲了家庭，遂不知如何是好。</p>
<p>舊的值得留戀，新的亦須適應，於是我們苦到了極點！</p>
<p>習慣與時勢，使我們不得不過兩重的年關，於是我們遂成了毫無理由的犧牲者。</p>
<h3>怎樣清除（海派）？</h3>
<p>— 毅君</p>
<p>自從北方有人對所謂（海派）文人（卽指上海新文學界的一些敗類）加以嘲駡之後，在上海的非（海派）文人也都感到有出來説話的必要了，早幾天（自由談）上就有人明白説過（在上海的非（海派）文人應該自已起來澄清，不必麻煩（京派）文人勞師遠征），可見疾惡如仇，人同此心，把那些要錢不要臉的文氓踼出於我們的新文壇以外，實在是很應當的！</p>
<p>可是至今大家所攻擊的還祗限於純文學的範圍，我以爲這是不對的。據我的意思，廓清（海派）的運動應當擴展到整個著作界才是。</p>
<p>請别人撰就文章，憑着一點吹拍之技，乞得主筆先生的哀憐，給予發表，因而在外招搖撞騙的時論家：家裏僱用大批文奴，從雜誌報章上東剪西抄，剽竊成書，用自已名字出版的著作者；自已不懂任何外國文，却憑着一點庶務之才，僱用幾個窮極無聊的翻譯，將日文譯成中文，又將中文譯成英文，用自已名字發表，幾方取巧的國際專家等等，這不正是（海派）文人的行逕嗎？爲什麽倒沒有人出來攻擊呢？是不是大家都被這種（海派）著作家一餐酒菜塞住了口呢？</p>
<p>據我看來，這種（海派）著作家比那些海派小説家的作惡力更大。他們雖是不學無術，但是鑽營活動的手法却是一等加一，他們常有把持文化機關的魔力，對於中國的文化界和著作界，可以給予極惡劣的影響。我以爲清除（海派）文人，應當先從此輩下手。</p>
<p>清除的方法怎樣呢？積極的很難説，消極的却是容易做到的：</p>
<p>（一）自愛的出版者（包括報館，雜誌社，書局）應當拒絕發表他們的東西；</p>
<p>（二）自愛的作家應當拒絕和他們合作（如他們辦刋物請你做特約撰述，辦學校請你做名譽敎授之類）；</p>
<p>（三）自愛的青年應當不受他們的豢養，不爲他們利用，給他們撰稿，編書，翻譯，爲虎作倀。這樣一來，這種（海派）著作家是可以慢慢消失的，他們會懂得文化界不是可以那樣買空賣空的；他們會走上他們應走的道路||做官或經商||而不致長此在文化界和著作界搗亂，使得上海新文化界全體都蒙不潔之名。</p>
<h3>除夕</h3>
<p>— 白燕</p>
<p>轉瞬，除夕又將到了。</p>
<p>在客地，每逢佳節，輒起繁思；那兒時悠悠的夢境，不禁又泛上我的心頭。</p>
<p>幼小時，對於除夕，我是感到怎樣的熱戀！在那時候，我可以穿新衣，我可以玩火爆，我還可以飽餐着佳肴；而且，卽使犯了些微的過錯，母親也不會怎樣的責罰我。······</p>
<p>但，在我十齡時，那一次的除夕却給與我一個頗難遺忘的印象。</p>
<p>那天、泳叔（我父親的朋友）很早就跑到我家來。父親讓他在書房中坐下。沒多久，父親因事出去了。祇剩他孤獨地留在房内。有時，母親也偶爾進房陪他談幾句；但他却那樣羞慚地輕聲的回答。我偎依在母親身旁，好奇地望着他，因爲他一向不是這樣。爲什麽在過年時，人們感到歡樂，他反而苦惱呢？出房後，我低聲地詢問母親。</p>
<p>（媽！爲什麽泳叔一個人躱在房裏？）</p>
<p>（他做（皇帝）（註一）！）母親低聲説。</p>
<p>可是我對於母親的回答，却依然不能了解。我只是偷偷地從窗𨻶裏去窺視他。</p>
<p>在房裏，他祇是無聊地徘徊着，有時却又孤寂地悶坐着。眉峯緊皺，感着非常苦惱似的。不時輕聲地喟歎。</p>

<h3>關於寫實的小説與第一人稱寫法之最後答辯</h3>
<p>— 穆木天</p>
<p>因爲（寫實的小説與第一人稱寫法）的問題，同陳君冶君作了一些枝節之爭陳君望風捕影空談高調地越談越遠。最好是結束好啦。</p>
<p>我提出那個問題的動機，是因爲讀了（文藝）之後，看見好幾篇青年的作品都是不適當地惰性地利用了第一人稱寫法。爲加以矯正起見，便作了那篇（談寫實的小説與第一人稱寫法。）</p>
<p>我的結論是寫實的小説須有其獨特的樣式。文學的樣式是有時代性的。寫實的小説須有他的基本的樣式，那是佔在支配的地位的。但是，舊的樣式，直到某種程度得以延續其餘命。舊的樣式里，可以裝上新内容，但是，　舊的樣式不能成爲支配的樣式。因之，寫實的小説主要地須用第三人稱。但那並不禁止有時也可以用第一人稱。但是，用第一人稱寫法，表現大的題材，廣汎的複雜的現實，無論怎樣支配得好也容易有毛病。譬如，在（由金·葛浪代）裏邊，無論呌哪個人物自述，恐怕都難寫得那魔周到。如果，陳君要我舉新現實主義的例子的話，那麽，（毁滅）就是很好的例子。又如（水滸傳）一類的作品，用第一人稱，自然是處理不出來的。不過，在單純題材的短小的作品裏，在相當的塲合，第一人稱，是仍可以用的。而那只是限於極窄小的範圍。如同（飢餓）等等。但那不能成爲現實主義的基本樣式。認爲那是同第三人稱寫法的等價的東西，是不可以的。</p>
<p>在現在的中國呢，用工農作主人公時，第一人稱寫法是更難以被運用得適宜的。若是呌農工自已寫呢，恐怕不成爲藝術品。因爲中國的農工都是文盲。若中呌知識分子去寫他們的自白呢，情緒，口吻，都是很難以逼眞。因之，在現在中國，第一人稱寫法又將被限制於極度窄狹的範圍之内。但，這並沒有説在現在中國，寫農工生活的作品是不能産出。</p>
<p>以上是我的結論。待我再把陳君的錯誤分析一下。陳君的論辯的精神是可欽佩的。不過，那些疎忽之點，似宜克服。</p>
<p>（一）陳君始終是觀念地在空談。他沒有就着作品作切實的討論。他認爲（楊媽的日記）是可以的。實在説，老媽子能寫那麽高雅的日記，誰都知道違背現實。他説：（適宜用第一人稱寫法卽用第一人稱寫法，可是他沒有指示出哪一篇作品是適宜地運用了的。</p>
<p>（二）陳君歪曲地片面地運用着他的材料。他全稱肯定地説高爾基是一個（偉大的現實主義者）而蒙蔽了高爾基的浪曼諦克之一面。他引用着福羅貝爾批評左拉的話：（他寫流氓就説流氓的話）而張冠李戴地説道（這正是作者製作第一人稱的寫實小説必讀的經典。）他忘却了（無我）和（冷靜）是十九世紀現實主義的信條。（魯貢，馬卡爾）裏，哪一篇是用第一人稱寫的呢。這是我要問的。</p>
<p>（三）陳君專會曲解人家的主張而主觀地，任意地施以發展。、我説：（在現在的文化落後的中國寫農工的小説用第一人稱寫法，更容易流於滑稽。）而陳君竟歪曲到現在中國農工小説不能被産生出來。像這樣故意歪曲，而詭詐地施以反駁，眞是（猪八戒倒打一耙）了。我以爲這種（論辯政策）不大好。</p>
<p>（四）舊現實主義與新現實主義雖有異點，但也有他們的同處。陳君對這點又是片面地了解了。固然二者是建立在不同的世界觀之上，但在要求（如實）之點上，是相同的。所描寫出的人物，必須是活的眞人，則是他們共通的要求。</p>
<p>（五）陳君機械地把内容與形式分開。他更機械地認爲不用第一人稱就是旁觀者的立塲。我們始終肯定内容與形式之一致性。不與内容連繫起來是不能作形式之探求的。此點，陳君尙未理解！並不是在一篇小説中，用第一人稱就能使作者同所寫的大衆不分開。（傾跌，）就是實例。（楊媽的日記）不是同樣麽？</p>
<p>最後關於文學的眞實性，又被陳君誤解了。關於此點，也許我有語病。自然我是反對寫實就是羅列堆積。現實主義是要表現出現實之各各方面及其關系，自是無容疑義的。</p>
<p>這個問題就如此結束了罷。本來，我以爲在原則上，我同陳君沒什麽大的差别。原有一篇長的答覆，只因自由談編者以篇幅關係要我縮改。因此，到現在才簡縮爲這一篇東西。</p>
<p>編者按：關於此一問題之討論，擬就此結束，以後雙方來稿，槪不刋載。</p>
<h3>我詛咒你那麽一笑（三）</h3>
<p>— 吳巖</p>
<p>一天，他到我們店裏來買東西，嘴裏説着緬甸話（姐伍）那個名字，他滿以爲住在緬甸地方</p>
<p>的人，總會懂緬甸話的。隨卽看見大家莫明其妙，就用姆指和二指做個圈圈，嘴裏重又説着：</p>
<p>（姐伍，姐伍······）</p>
<p>我們店裏的兩位外交人材，老板娘和她的大女兒，便把（姐伍）這個名子，費力地推測着。</p>
<p>（芒果嗎？）</p>
<p>老板娘覺得他平常一來店裏，看見有新下樹的水果，總要買一點的，所以便這樣説。跟着就向門外的芒果樹，指了一指，看看這位印度人到底要那種果子。</p>
<p>印度人搖搖頭，紅着臉，急促起來了。</p>
<p>（姐伍，姐伍······）</p>
<p>連連説着，一個音一個音地吐出，手又做着圓圈圈。然而外交大臣的老板娘，也失敗了，誰還猜得出呢？</p>
<p>（我曉得了，我曉得了。）</p>
<p>做媽媽帮辦的女兒，猛然爆發似地呌了起來，拍達拍達地響着木拖鞋，跑進廚下去了。笑嘻嘻地端了一竹筐子洋山芋，又拍達拍達地跑了出來，高高地舉在印度人的面前，幾乎要抵着他棕色的鼻頭了。快活地急説着：</p>
<p>（是不是，是不是，是不是，······你這啞巴！）</p>
<p>但這印度人還是擺着下巴，而臉却更紅了　，不自然地微笑着，嘴裏想説話，却又説不出來，很着急。</p>
<p>滿以爲凖猜着了的，却結果仍是錯了，她便異常的掃興，竹筐子軟拖拖地墜了下來，尖起嘴，氣狠狠地直對着印度人駡：</p>
<p>（你要死了！印度鬼！）</p>
<p>自然他不懂得，但却明白在駡他，就現出非常難過的樣子。</p>
<p>（不要聽他的鬼話了！）</p>
<p>老板娘看見這已經上了門的生意，做不成，嘆了一口氣，便坐在一邊，敞開黑洋布的胸襟，扯出奶頭，塞在孩子嘴裏，一面輕輕地搖着。</p>
<p>這位陷到絕境的，弄成又稯又啞的印度人，突然一吓子精靈了，便稍微俯下身子，蹲在地上，把兩腕平伸了起來，鳥兒拍翅似地扇着，嘴裏做出這樣的聲音。</p>

<h3>（高帽子）與（入門笑）</h3>
<p>— 童子</p>
<p>在現社會裏頭，想混一碗飯吃，去找親戚朋友帮忙，總得備辦一點禮物，孝敬孝敬，這種孝敬的東西，就呌（入門笑）。</p>
<p>由這（入門笑）三個字的定名上看來，可知這項東西的關係的重大了：有了入門，就可以買人家的笑，是一種好的兆頭（？）那末，我們要找事情，要拜託親戚朋友，就得愼重一下，不惜犧牲，不顧工本的去買人家的笑。要知道沒有入門，人家是不會笑的，不笑就不妙了？</p>
<p>但是，人總是爲了窮，才出來找飯吃，爲了找飯吃，才跑去拜託親戚朋友；低首下心，東投人西投人的原因，無非想弄個事情，一點銅錢吧了。在事情還沒有成就之先，倒先要花一筆本錢，這不是憂憂乎其難哉嗎？</p>
<p>况且，（入門笑）這東西，又不是可以馬馬虎虎的，用之得當，則吉，用之不得當，則兇。送人家的東西，總得投其所好，至少也要個大方得體；不然得罪了人家，丢了人家的面子，那時，豈但不能買笑而已，恐怕還要惹人家動親的呢？</p>
<p>因此，（入門笑），簡直是求事情的進身之階，又是求事情的當頭之棒了。</p>
<p>我想：人總是喜歡（恭維）的，孝敬禮物，也無非是（恭維）；（恭維）得好，就可以博其一笑。但，禮物的（恭維），第一，要花得起，第二，要人家合意；花不起，不能（恭維）人家不合意，不能成其爲（恭維），像這樣的許多爲難，倒不如利用（高帽子）的來得簡便而又經濟了。</p>
<p>（高帽子）的原銜是（奉承），别字（拍馬），我們的肚裏，就是這東西的大本營，我們可以把舌頭來做送禮的柬帖。這種不花本錢的（入門笑），是取之無禁，用之不竭的，我們要拜託人家，辦不起禮物不要緊，只要送頂（高帽子）給他就行了。</p>
<p>（高帽子）是誰都喜歡戴的，絕對沒有那個不合意的道理！祇要一頂，兩頂，三四五六頂的送得去，還怕人家不笑嗎？</p>

<h3>Sun Dianying Prepares to Resist to the End</h3>
<p>Yu Shiming, Liu Yueting, and Ding Futing All Unable to Accept Military Orders</p>
<p>Sun's Troops Are Disturbing the Area Twenty Li Around Ningyuan</p>
<p>Xu Yongchang to Arrive in Beiping Immediately, Military Arrangements for Joint Suppression by Various Provinces Largely in Place</p>
<p>One Account Says Yu Shiming Sent a Telegram to He</p>
<p>Requesting that Personnel be Sent to Supervise the Downsizing</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying is preparing to resist to the end, leading his troops westward. Yu Shiming, Liu Yueting, and Ding Futing are all former subordinates of Sun, with historical ties. Regarding the military's order to reorganize Sun's troops under their command, they are determined not to accept it. It is reported that Sun's troops are causing disturbances near the outskirts of Ningxia, totaling over 20,000 men, all within a 20 li radius of Ningyuan, under the command of Yu Shiming and others. According to a telegram received by the 15th Route Army Office from Ma, Ningyuan is still in our army's hands, and the report of its loss is inaccurate. The telegram from Ma also summoned his younger brother Ma Hongbing to Ningxia. Ma and Bai Jianmin went to Jurentang this morning to see He and seek instructions on everything, and they are scheduled to depart in a day or two. The military arrangements for the joint suppression of Sun's troops by various provinces are largely in place. After Xu Yongchang arrives in Beiping in a day or two to see He, report on Yan's intentions, and discuss solutions, they can begin to implement them. He originally intended to send Hou Cheng to Taiyuan again, but because Xu is about to arrive in Beiping, the trip has been temporarily postponed. (Special Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Military news: Yu Shiming telegraphed He on the 6th, saying, "Your telegram of the 5th is respectfully received. I am in the military ranks, and I am deeply grateful for your kindness. I will never forget it. Military Commander Sun has resigned, and you have approved it. I will certainly follow your orders to maintain order and be responsible for the reorganization and stationing. I still hope that you will send personnel as soon as possible so that I can follow your instructions and avoid mistakes. Please telegraph when personnel will depart so that I can go to Baotou to welcome them. This telegram is respectfully submitted." (Special Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Military authorities are currently considering candidates for Yu Shiming's request to send personnel to supervise the downsizing and defense area. (Special Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The highest military authorities, because Sun continued to make trouble after being dismissed, fiercely attacking Ningxia, have decided to implement an encirclement and painful strike against Sun's army. (Special Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>Taiyuan: Wang Jingguo, due to the tense situation of the Sun-Ma battle and the defense of western Suiyuan, completed the transfer of his troops to Baotou. This morning, he made a special trip to the riverbank to see Yan and seek instructions on everything. Wang returned to Taiyuan in the evening and is scheduled to return to Suiyuan tomorrow morning. (Special Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The troops of Ma Bufang, the Qinghai Garrison Commander, who were intercepting Sun's army's westward invasion, have made contact with the 15th Route Army. (Special Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Guihua Telegram: Men Bingyue returned to Beiping from Suiyuan on the 9th due to He's summons. (Special Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Military news: Ma Hongbin, Ma Hongkui, and others telegraphed at noon on the 6th that on the afternoon of the 5th, two units of our 15th Route Army surrounded the enemy in the Li Family Village, Bao Family Fortress, Zhu Family Village, and Bao Family Bridge area southwest of Ningcheng. Xia Weili's brigade and the two regiments of Diao Moulin and Yuan Ying killed over a thousand enemies, seized over 600 enemy rifles, 40 light machine guns, and 100 pistols. 583 enemy officers and soldiers were captured on the 4th. The rebel Xia Weili was confirmed to have been blown up and killed, and the body is currently being examined. Last night, the enemy surrounded by our troops in the Baliqiao and Mandaqiao area tried to break through to the east and west to provide reinforcements, but were repelled by our troops. This morning, the remnants of the enemy near Li Family Village in the southwest fled from the northwest of Xincheng towards Mandaqiao and were pursued and intercepted by our army, capturing over a hundred people and seizing over fifty rifles. They are still attacking. The bandit cavalry of Yang Houzi, since the 4th, has been harassing the Yanghepu area, 40 li south of Ningcheng, and after being repelled by our division, they have dispersed to harass the nearby fortresses. The cavalry regiment is ordered to quickly suppress them. (Special Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun and Ma's troops are still engaged in fierce battles near the outskirts of Ningxia. Sun's troops have over 20,000 people in Pingluo, about 4,000 people in Shizuizi, and over 20,000 people near Ningxia. Because the division twice failed to attack Ningcheng and suffered more than half of their casualties, the soldiers have no fighting spirit, so there are many deserters, and most of them are newly recruited bandits, making it difficult to command them. With their existing strength scattered in various places, they can only make local attacks, and it is difficult to make large-scale offensives. With the Ma family troops uniting the armies of Gansu and Qinghai, their strength is sufficient to cope. Yu Shiming, Liu Yueting, Ding Futing, and others, seeing the situation like this, are all worried. The authorities' method of dealing with Sun's troops is in progress. The Jin and Sui armies are prepared and ready to move out and assist in the suppression. (Special Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) It is reported that He Yingqin telegraphed the Central Government, saying that Sun Dianying has not repented after being dismissed and is still leading his troops to attack Ningxia. If such disregard for the Central Government and contempt for laws is not quickly extinguished, it will not be enough to restore order. The generals in North China also believe that Sun's actions are wrong and intend to ask the Central Government to issue a clear order to suppress them and prevent disaster in the Northwest. (Special Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Bufang, the Qingxi Garrison Commander, telegraphed Beijing, saying that he had received orders to transfer his troops to reinforce Ningxia and had ordered his cavalry to advance at full speed and cooperate with the Ning army to suppress them and prevent disaster in the Northwest. (Special Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>Ningxia, Ningxia Various Groups Telegraphically Request Disaster Relief for the People. (Titles Omitted) Sun Dianying's troops have a notoriously bad reputation, as everyone in the country knows. This invasion of Ningxia is particularly brutal. Wherever the remnants of the troops go, villages are turned into ruins. Ningxia Province was originally poor and barren, and most farmers are in dire straits. Moreover, Sun's troops, with tens of thousands of men, advanced westward at full speed, with food and supplies abandoned thousands of miles away. Therefore, as soon as they entered Ningcheng, they looted civilian food and property. After the rice and wheat were exhausted, they slaughtered livestock. After the cattle and sheep were exhausted, they continued with donkeys and dogs, searching every hiding place, digging a foot into the ground, destroying houses, leaving scorched earth, raping women, and killing the good. The disasters were as bad as those caused by the Red Bandits and the rebels. The small cavalry of Yang Houzi and the defeated troops of Rehe were particularly cruel. Ningxia Province is unlucky, and disasters are frequent. The flood has just subsided, and then came the war. People are displaced and wander on the road. The situation of starvation and freezing deaths is something that anyone with a heart cannot help but feel sympathy for. Although Sun's army has been defeated, the remnants have not yet been eliminated. The people have suffered disasters, and relief is urgently needed. We beg you to have mercy on the disaster victims and quickly plan for post-disaster relief, so that two million people will not die in the war and suffering. We will be infinitely grateful. The telegram is urgent, and we cannot help but hope and pray.

<h3>Reception Ceremony for Yuguan Held at 10 AM This Morning</h3>
<p>Tao Shangming and Iwai Discussed the Reception Procedures</p>
<p>All Puppet Organizations Have Been Closed Except for Those Being Relocated</p>
<p>The Japanese Kwantung Army Will Still Transfer a Unit to be Permanently Stationed in Yuguan</p>
<p>Reception of Gubeikou to Take Place After the Spring Festival</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Tao Shangming arrived in Yuguan the day before yesterday, he immediately consulted with Iwai and the heads of the puppet local maintenance association and public security bureau on the reception procedures for Yuguan. It was decided that the reception ceremony would be held at 10 AM tomorrow morning, with Tao Shangming and Iwai representing both sides to supervise and manage the handover. After all administrative documents are handed over, our newly appointed Special Public Security Bureau Chief Su Yuqi and Linyu County Magistrate Yuan Tai will take office separately and begin working in Yuguan. All puppet organizations have been closed except for those being relocated to Dongluocheng. The Hiraga Brigade of the Kwantung Army is preparing to depart due to a transfer outside the pass, and it will be difficult to move tomorrow. After the Hiraga Brigade leaves the pass, the Kwantung Army will still transfer another unit to be permanently stationed in Yuguan. The reception of Gubeikou was originally planned to be carried out before the Spring Festival, following Yuguan, but due to the time constraints, the Japanese representative for the handover has not yet been appointed and must first consult with the Kwantung Army, so it has been changed to after the Spring Festival. Yin Rugeng's trip to Tianjin to seek instructions has largely been completed and he may return to Beiping tomorrow night. The newly appointed Milin County Magistrate Yu Haoting will come with Yin to Milin to take up his new post. The former County Magistrate Sun Shutang returned to Milin yesterday to hand over his responsibilities. (Special Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Twenty policemen stationed in Qinhuangdao took the 101st train unarmed this morning to Yuguan to take over the county government office. The merchants and residents of Yuguan are extremely happy because of tomorrow morning's reception and will hang the Blue Sky White Sun flag to celebrate. (Special Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The puppet border police in Yuguan city are still stationed at the South Gate Station, responsible for inspecting passengers, and have not yet withdrawn. The puppet Fengshan Road Station originally occupied the buildings of the Beining Road, and is now building a station in a red building east of the station, which will be completed on March 1. (Special Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The War Zone Industrial Promotion Association approved the allocation of 10,000 yuan to repair the long-distance telephone line in the Ji-Mi Administrative District, with Yin receiving the payment. (9th)</p>
<p>Tianjin: Regarding the reception of Yuguan, the Chinese and Japanese sides decided that at 11:00 AM on the 10th, Tao Shangming from our side and a staff officer from the Japanese Kwantung Army would hold the handover ceremony at the Linyu County Government. Su Yuqi will also take office as the Special Public Security Bureau Chief at the same time and place. After the reception of Yuguan, the Linyu County Government will immediately move back to Shanhaiguan. The Japanese army will completely withdraw to Dongluocheng. Iwai will still work in the county. The special service agency and the military police team will remain as before and a garrison headquarters will be established in the original He Zhuguo Army Headquarters. The Yuguan Security Maintenance Association will end on the 10th. Zhang Runzhai and two committee members from the association have been hired as advisors to the Special Public Security Bureau. Tao Shangming, Su Yuqi, and Yuan Qin are staying at the Railway Hotel at the station. After the reception is completed and the Luan-Yu Administrative Commissioner's Office is established, they will return to Beiping to report. Regarding the reception of Yuguan, the Hebei Provincial Government had not received a report from Tao Shangming as of the 7th. (Special Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese army is searching for firearms from house to house in the villages within the walled city, confiscating them immediately, and arresting our farmers, accusing them of being righteous soldiers resisting the Japanese and Manchus. Even if they are bailed out by merchants, they refuse to release them. Nearly dozens of people have been imprisoned recently. (Special Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Hebei Provincial Bureau plans to establish a Zazhi Bureau after the reception of Gubeikou, directly under the county magistrate, to handle local administration and police affairs. (Special Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A reporter visited Cao Jianting, the Hebei Postal Director, today. According to him, the Yuguan Post Office has never been withdrawn. After the puppet regime established a bureau in the area, the mailboxes were shared. When the mailmen collected letters, they took their own letters without interfering with each other. There was no communication between the two bureaus. Now that Yuguan has been received, there is no need for the post office to hand over. The Gubeikou Post Office will be transferred to the Ping General Bureau, and it is said that it will be restored after the reception. The postal offices outside the Great Wall that our post office withdrew were Xinglong and Zhangshan. Last year, due to the war, the postal revenue was too bad, but it has improved in the past three or four months. (Special Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Tong returned to Tianjin this morning. (Special Telegram, 9th)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Incite Puyi to Illegally Assume the Title [of Emperor] for Easier Control</h3>
<p>(Beiping) In the puppet State Council, regarding Puyi's ascension to the throne as emperor, there are two distinct factions. The Manchurian faction advocates consolidating the foundation of Manchuria, developing towards the Chinese interior, and restoring the Qing Dynasty. The Japanese faction advocates first consolidating Inner Mongolia to strengthen the foundation of Manchuria and Mongolia, avoid international disadvantages, and then seize the opportunity to enter the customs. As a result, the Japanese faction's proposal was adopted. The reason for Puyi's desire for it is that Japan plans to annex Eastern Mongolia. If Puyi does not restore his old title, it will be difficult to summon the Mongolian princes. Currently, the assistant administrators of the puppet regime are all members of the Manchu imperial family, former Qing officials, or Mongolian hereditary nobles who have come to show their loyalty. If the government changes, these people may not be willing to serve their successors. It is better to change the traditional system and forever maintain the hearts of the people. According to the current situation of the puppet Manchu regime, when the Japanese make demands, they still have to formally go through the discussion of a majority of the puppet bigwigs. If the system is changed, the country will only have one ruler, and everything can be taken and given at will, satisfying their desires. With one person submitting a memorial, tens of millions of square miles of Manchuria will become a Japanese protectorate, with an added layer of guarantee. For these reasons, the Japanese are eager to realize the puppet state's claim to emperorship. (Special Telegram, 9th)</p>
<h3>The Puppet Organization Will Implement a New Military System</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The puppet executive government convened a puppet national defense conference on December 26 last year, gathering various puppet military and political leaders. It was resolved to establish a puppet National Defense Supervision Office, concurrently held by the puppet Minister of Military and Political Affairs Zhang Jinghui, to organize a national defense force of 300,000 men, and to build national defense fortresses. The expenses will be a surcharge on various railways as a special fund for national defense. The puppet state plans to abolish the existing organizations of garrison troops in various provinces and regions, dividing the country into five military districts. Each military district will have three garrison armies, each garrison army consisting of two or three brigades. The military district will have one commander, appointed by a lieutenant general or above, and the garrison commander will be appointed by a major general or a brigadier general. The military district commanders have been tentatively designated as Yu Zhishan, Ji Xing, Zhang Wentao, Zhang Haipeng, and Batema Labutan. It is said that this new system will be implemented in early July this year. The Japanese army will send the Eighth Division of Xi Yi back to the country at the end of February this year, and the Asahikawa Seventh Division will come to fill the defense. The Hirata Fourteenth Brigade, currently stationed in western Liaoning and the Yuguan area, originally belonged to the Seventh Division and is now gradually moving towards Rehe. In the future, the subsequent troops of the Seventh Division, newly arrived, will either take over the Liaoxi defenses of the brigade. (Special Telegram, 9th)</p>

<h3>The Opinions of the British and American Embassies on Revising the Trade Treaty</h3>

<h3>Shi Qingyang Discusses the Dalai Lama Memorial Service</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the Dalai Lama's memorial service, newspaper reports are not entirely accurate. Here's what Shi Qingyang said: (1) The Dalai Lama was the foremost political and religious leader of Tibet for the past two to three hundred years. After the government received the report of the Dalai Lama's passing, a posthumous title was specially bestowed, and high-ranking officials were dispatched to Tibet to pay respects. Furthermore, a grand memorial service was held in Beijing. (2) This memorial service in Beijing was essentially a state ceremony, demonstrating the government's intention to cherish those from afar, secure the borders, respect the virtuous, and honor merit. Efforts were made to avoid extravagance and keep expenses economical without detracting from the solemnity. (3) Historically, the government has held sutra-chanting ceremonies for the passing of both the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama. Although the form of government has changed, the national sentiment remains the same; therefore, sutra-chanting ceremonies are still held. However, participation in the memorial service is not limited to Buddhists or religious people. Therefore, state rituals are the focus, with the most respectful offerings of incense, flowers, and silk, without adopting religious rituals, and the event is completed in one day. (4) As there was no suitable location in Beijing, the Examination Yuan's Minzhi Building was borrowed as the venue. It is connected to Jiming Temple, and the sutra-chanting site was set up in Jiming Temple. The date was set for three days. Those who wished to recite sutras, whether monks or laypeople, went to Jiming Temple and did not need to go to the auditorium. The Panchen Lama brought his own retinue to Beijing, and the accommodations were inconvenient. The Grand Master often felt unwell. President Dai proposed that he reside in Ningyuan Building for rest and recuperation, and after matters in Beijing were completed, he would move to Tangshan. During this time, the Panchen Lama himself recited sutras at his residence, without setting up an altar or receiving guests. Those who wished to hear the Buddha's teachings would be given another location at a future date. (5) The savings from the economical conference expenses will be used for two purposes: (1) to select a suitable location in Beijing to establish a memorial monument for the Dalai Lama, and (2) to be used for other charitable undertakings in the capital. (Central News Agency dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Preparatory Office for the Dalai Lama Memorial Service held its second meeting at 2:00 PM on the 9th. Over twenty people attended, including Shi Qingyang, heads of various groups, and representatives of various agencies. Shi Qingyang chaired the meeting and resolved: (1) the memorial rites; (2) to invite agencies to send five or more representatives to participate in the memorial ceremony; (3) to compile and print a brief biography of the Dalai Lama, to be the responsibility of the Office for Tibetan Affairs; (4) other matters.

<h3>Liu Wenhui Plans to Restore Dakie Temple</h3>

<h3>First Shot in the North Manchuria Trade War: Rumor of an Economic Agreement Between the US and Russia</h3>
<p>Russia Draws US Merchants into the North Manchuria Market</p>
<p>Secret Agreement Includes Military Supplies Industry</p>
<p>(Harbin) Centered around American Consul General Chaies in Harbin, several American consuls and resident staff of the Standard Oil Company of New York in Manchuria have been holding secret meetings at the American Consulate in Harbin for several days. From 6:00 PM on the 7th to 1:00 AM on the 8th, they deliberated for eight hours. This meeting involves an agreement between the US and the Soviet Union to transform the North Manchuria market, which the Soviet Union has spent a great deal of time acquiring, into a joint market and to develop American products. It aims to actively introduce American goods into North Manchuria and form an economic entity between the US and the Soviet Union in the Orient. The secret agreement even extends to the military supplies industry. In this regard, the US and the Soviet Union are each following their political relations to form an economic entity in North Manchuria. Due to the active involvement of both countries, the economic entities of Japan-Manchuria and the US-Soviet Union are poised to become confrontational. The first shot in the North Manchuria economic market war is about to explode. Therefore, the attitudes of the US and the Soviet Union are particularly noteworthy.

<h3>Matsumoto Takes Office as Minister of Commerce and Industry</h3>
<p>Question of Prime Minister Saito's Responsibility</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At 10:00 AM this morning, the Emperor held a ceremony in the Phoenix Room of the Imperial Palace for the appointment of Dr. Matsumoto Joji, a member of the House of Peers, as Minister of Commerce and Industry. The Emperor issued an edict to Matsumoto, and Prime Minister Saito presented him with the official document, appointing Matsumoto Joji, with the rank of Fourth Class, Third Order of Merit, as Minister of Commerce and Industry. (Japan United Press Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The atmosphere of questioning the Minister of Commerce and Industry in the House of Peers has dissipated due to the resignation of Minister of Commerce and Industry Nakajima. However, the question of Prime Minister Saito's responsibility for requesting the Emperor to appoint Nakajima has not been resolved, and the government's attitude on this matter is attracting attention from all sides. Chief Secretary Horikiri carefully examined the records of the questions raised by Kikuchi Takeo and Mimurodo Keiko in the House of Peers on the 7th in the Diet. According to the records, their words did not explicitly demand that the Prime Minister answer regarding the responsibility for requesting the Emperor to appoint Nakajima as Minister of Commerce and Industry. However, based on the overall questioning, it is clear that they intended to demand an answer from the Prime Minister. Therefore, the government decided that Prime Minister Saito would answer at the House of Peers meeting on the 9th, expressing regret. Because the reason for the resignation of the Minister of Commerce and Industry was illness, the events surrounding it were not mentioned. (Japan United Press Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The speed of the praise for Mr. Nakajima, which led to the replacement of the Minister of Commerce and Industry, was unexpected. A faction within the political world believes that the problem cannot be solved with just the resignation of the Minister of Commerce and Industry and that Prime Minister Saito should also be held responsible for recommending Nakajima, who has such ideas, as a state minister. However, the government argues that it is impossible to examine the past interests of each cabinet member when requesting their appointment and that it cannot be held responsible for the personal essays published by Mr. Nakajima. Therefore, it argues that responsibility can be discussed separately and will respond to the parliament accordingly. Furthermore, the reason for the resignation of Minister of Commerce and Industry Nakajima is that he is unable to fulfill his duties due to his ailing body. When the Prime Minister inevitably answers Mimurodo's questions, he will clearly state this intention. The issue of replacing the Minister of Commerce and Industry will not affect the cabinet. Even in the House of Representatives, the Nationalist Alliance wants to use this as a tool to bring down the cabinet, but it is unlikely to succeed. Therefore, the political situation is expected to return to normal and come to an end. However, the movement to promote a political party led by Nakajima is likely to be significantly affected. (Electric Communication Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is heard that the appointment of Dr. Matsumoto Joji as Minister of Commerce and Industry is because he and the Prime Minister are close friends. At the beginning of the cabinet formation, a key position was already reserved for him. He is intelligent, well-versed in law, and, along with the late Dr. Hanai Takuzo, was one of the twin pillars of the House of Peers. After his appointment, he will give famous answers in the parliament like Mr. Wakatsuki since the beginning. Moreover, his personality is known to the world. He has always been unaffiliated in the House of Peers, so this election is particularly appropriate. His future guiding principles are as follows: (1) Although rationalizing and controlling industries is necessary, it must be based on liberalism, with a slight easing of the controlled economy. (2) Revamp the affairs of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, organize the stalled bills, and adopt a principle of immediate decision-making for those submitted to the parliament.

<h3>Roosevelt's Message to Congress Explaining the Procedure for Restricting Sugar Production</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt sent a message to Congress today, stating the procedure for restricting sugar production: (1) Beets and sugarcane should be basic commodities of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, so that sugar processing taxes can be levied to benefit farmers who comply with quotas; (2) levy a processing tax of less than half a cent per pound of sugar, so as to raise sufficient funds; (3) in order to compensate consumers, the sugar tax should be reduced by one unit, according to the processing tax; (4) the tax rate of the processing tax must not exceed the amount of the sugar tax after reduction; (5) the Secretary of Agriculture should be authorized by the amendment to the Agricultural Adjustment Act to require sugar refineries, importers, etc. to obtain licenses, and to buy or sell sugar in each producing area according to the ratio of the sales in that area to the total sales in the United States. According to President Roosevelt's opinion, this quota can immediately adjust the supply and demand of the market and establish production reduction to meet the needs of the United States. President Roosevelt also proposed provisional quotas for each producing area as follows: Continental beets: 1,450,000 tons; Louisiana and Florida: 260,000 tons; Hawaii: 935,000 tons; Puerto Rico: 821,000 tons; Philippines: 1,037,000 tons; Cuba: 1,944,000 tons; Virgin Islands: 5,000 tons, for a total of 6,452,000 tons.

<h3>Britain's Air Combat Weapon</h3>
<p>Hawker Super Fury Fighter</p>
<p>Suitable for Defense, Not Attack</p>
<p>Can Climb 20,000 Feet in Nine Minutes</p>
<p>(London) During the debate in the House of Commons yesterday on Britain's national defense, it was said that Britain now has a completely novel fighter plane that can ascend and descend almost vertically and can climb to a height of 20,000 feet in nine minutes, which has aroused considerable attention. According to today's newspapers, this plane is the (Hawker Super Fury Machine). Only two of these machines have been built so far. The cost of manufacturing three of these machines is equal to the cost of one bomber. The future function of this machine depends entirely on how air defense planes are used. It is said that after a warning is issued, this type of straight-up plane can rise into the sky within twenty-seven minutes to attack any kind of invading air force. Therefore, it can be said that a new era in air combat tactics has begun. However, this machine cannot be used for attack because it can only carry one person and cannot carry bombs because it does not have strong lift. Therefore, it is not suitable for attacking neighboring countries. (National News Agency Dispatch, 8th)</p>

<h3>Hua on the Resumption of Diplomatic Relations Between Hungary and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>According to foreign news, the treaty on the resumption of diplomatic relations between Hungary and the Soviet Union was formally signed on February 6 at the Soviet Embassy in Rome. From then on, the normal diplomatic relations between Hungary and the Soviet Union could be restored, and the countries of the Little Entente in Central Europe seemed likely to follow Hungary's example and continue to conclude treaties with the Soviet Union in the near future, establishing normal diplomatic relations. If we compare this with the recent diplomatic changes in Central Europe, such as the conclusion of the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, the conflicts between Germany and Austria, and the ongoing Austrian-Hungarian talks, we can see that the rapprochement between Hungary and the Soviet Union is not only the establishment of the Soviet Union's plan to encircle Germany, but also the beginning of the increasingly acute dual relationship between German-French conflict and German-Italian rivalry. The Soviet Union is looking far ahead, maneuvering among the countries, aiming to control Hitler, the anti-Soviet vanguard, through the countries of Central Europe and prevent him from crossing the Danube. Its diplomatic tactics can be described as agile, and the future direction of European diplomatic relations and the changes in world peace are closely related to this. Can the world ignore it?</p>
<p>Hungary is a new country formed after the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Its land area is less than 40,000 square miles, and its population does not exceed nine million, but it is located in the center of the Danube River basin, fertile and suitable for agriculture, and its industry is developed. In terms of market relations, it and Austria, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and other countries are the targets of competition for European powers, and especially Germany. Since the establishment of the Treaty of Versailles, the resources of the Danube River have been meat on the chopping block for others. This is a great and fatal wound to the development of German capitalism. For ten years after the war, it was bound by others and could not succeed. After Hitler took office, he tried his best to use his party members in the countries of Central Europe, hoping to establish a majority of allied countries to create a kindred regime. In fact, he wanted to encompass Central Europe and restore the old country, and then rely on this to ask the whole of Europe. His plan can be described as great. In January of this year, Hitler signed a ten-year non-aggression pact with Poland. Given the long-standing disputes between Germany and Poland, Hitler was able to endure it as much as possible. We knew early on that he had other plans. Negatively, it was to stabilize the eastern neighbors; positively, it was to invade Central Europe to the south. Sure enough, before long, there were signs of National Socialist Party members in Austria attempting to seize power, which eventually led Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss to appeal to the League of Nations. Hitler's ambitious plans are indeed astonishing, but the means by which others respond to them, such as the Soviet Union, are even more ingenious than Hitler's.</p>
<p>Hitler's active invasion of Central Europe is deeply hated by France on the one hand, and especially worried by Italy on the other. Therefore, France controls the countries of Central Europe and the Balkans with the Little Entente and the Four-Power Pact, while Italy befriends Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and other countries to control Hitler's expansion of power in the Danube River basin. The Soviet Union takes advantage of this to form a strong front encircling Germany. After the resumption of diplomatic relations between Hungary and the Soviet Union, the development of this situation is even more clear. Since Litvinov returned to the United States via Rome, people in the know knew early on that he had some plans for anti-German plans. After the conclusion of the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, it was even more known that diplomatic relations in Central Europe would become more tense. Will Hitler, under this situation of being forced into this situation, use all his strength to plan for further progress in Central Europe, or will he build strong allies outside of Europe to break through this encirclement? This is a question that deserves attention.</p>
<h3>Balkan Pact Signed Amidst Joyful Church Bells</h3>
<p>Mutual Guarantee of Border Security</p>
<p>Treaty Valid for Five Years</p>
<p>Bulgaria's Failure to Join is a Shortcoming</p>
<p>Athens The new Balkan Pact signed by the four countries of Greece, Romania, Turkey and Yugoslavia, was officially signed here today, as the church bells rang out and the military bands of the four countries played their national anthems to the cheers of the people. The pact is limited to five years, stipulates mutual guarantee of borders, and calls for unified action on all matters involving the interests of the signatory countries. Bulgaria did not sign, but the special concessions obtained by Yugoslavia in the pact should alleviate Greece's attitude. Three days ago, Greek semi-official circles stated that the Greek government's attitude towards the pact was that Greece would rather sign a mutual non-aggression agreement established within the framework of the League of Nations and in accordance with the Kellogg-Briand Pact. This is the most appropriate way to consolidate Balkan peace. It is also heard that the treaty stipulates that the countries should economically and politically oppose any revision of the Treaty of Versailles. (Reuters Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>French Parties United to Form Coalition Cabinet for the Nation</h3>
<p>Premier Doumergue; Foreign Affairs: Barthou</p>
<p>Petain and Pietri in Charge of the Army and Navy</p>
<p>Gathering the National Intellectual Elite</p>
<p>Former Cabinet Ministers Occupy Five Seats</p>
<p>(Paris) The cabinet lineup began in the afternoon and is generally as follows: Premier Doumergue, Minister of Justice Cheron (former Minister of Finance), Minister of Interior Sarraut (former Premier), Minister of Finance Germain-Martin (former Budget Minister), Minister of Foreign Affairs Barthou (former Premier), Minister of the Army General Petain, Minister of the Navy Pietri (former Minister of Finance), Minister of Aviation General Denain, Minister of Labor Marant (leader of the right wing), Minister of Public Works Flandin (former Minister of Finance), Minister of Colonies Laval (former Premier), Minister of Agriculture Theydiou (former Premier), Minister of Commerce Herriot (former Premier), Minister of National Education Dervaux (former Minister of Pensions). (Havas Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Since the Socialist Party is unwilling to support, Doumergue fears that he will not be able to form a government of national unity. General Petain declared that although he dislikes hearing politics, if he is appointed as Minister of the Army, he will handle military affairs pragmatically. After meeting with Doumergue today, various political leaders expressed optimism. The new cabinet is expected to be formed this afternoon. The Communist Party plans to hold a large rally on Republic Road tonight to condemn Fascism, which has been banned by the Paris Police Chief. (Reuters Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>Act in Accordance with the Constitution</h3>
<p>(Paris) Doumergue left his quiet homeland and re-entered politics to work for the country. When he arrived in the capital, the public regarded him as a savior and paid him respectful salutes. Because Mr. Doumergue is already seventy years old, taking on the country's difficult tasks at an old age has made people even more admire his spirit of righteousness. Mr. Doumergue declared in his old friend Briand's office at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: (I am not a revolutionary; I will act in accordance with the Constitution. As for whether the Constitution should be amended, that is another matter).</p>
<h3>The Premier Does Not Concurrently Hold a Ministerial Post</h3>
<p>After arriving in the capital, Doumergue did not rest and immediately began forming a cabinet, promising to complete it within twelve hours. Mr. Doumergue warned visitors that he was not a magician and did not believe in magic. His assumption of the premiership does not include holding a ministerial post concurrently so that he can freely deal with everything. Mr. Doumergue followed the usual practice of first seeking the opinions of the speakers of both the Senate and the House of Representatives.</p>
<h3>Each Party is Willing to Provide Support</h3>
<p>Internationally renowned French politicians have agreed to support Doumergue. The Radical Party in the House of Representatives has also asked Herriot to declare to Doumergue that he is willing to provide assistance. However, the attitude of the Radical Party cannot be relied upon until it is decided after the meeting.</p>
<h3>Cautiously Selecting the Minister of Finance</h3>
<p>Last night, according to reliable sources, Doumergue has abandoned the idea of recruiting former prime ministers to organize a new cabinet and does not want to form a government (outside of parliament). Mr. Doumergue, seeing that the instability of the budget has been one of the main reasons for the failure of previous cabinets, has invited the famous former Minister of Finance Caillaux, who has served as premier and finance minister, to consult. Mr. Caillaux is also a seventy-year-old man.</p>
<h3>Like a General Returning in Triumph</h3>
<p>After Doumergue was ordered to form a cabinet, all parties believed that the possibility of revolution had been averted. Mr. Doumergue met with President Lebrun for fifteen minutes yesterday and briefly described his plan, and then began work. At the same time, a large number of workers were cleaning up various commemorative objects abandoned by rioters in the streets in the past two days. On the way to the Presidential Palace and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Doumergue's scene was like a general returning in triumph, and those who saw him cheered and saluted. In the afternoon, Mr. Doumergue had a long talk with Daladier, who is nominally still the prime minister before the new cabinet is formed.</p>
<p>Before Doumergue arrived in the capital, Daladier urged President Lebrun to declare martial law, but was rejected.</p>
<h3>The People's Hearts are Greatly Comforted</h3>
<p>After Mr. Doumergue took on the difficult task of forming a cabinet, the people's hearts were greatly comforted. This afternoon and evening, crowds stood in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for several hours, eager to know the names of the new cabinet members selected by Mr. Doumergue. Troops were stationed in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs square to prevent a recurrence of the riot, but the crowds were orderly, quite different from two days ago.</p>
<h3>The Imperial System Has Long Been Abandoned</h3>
<p>At the same time, Xavier, who resides in Belgium and calls himself the King of the French Empire, issued a declaration, respectfully informing the French parties, classes, and races, saying, (The time has come to re-implement the imperial system on which France's greatness is based). Parisians dismissed this declaration with indifference. Qualified observers expressed their opinions, saying that imperialism, like communism, has been abandoned by French politics. (Reuters Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>The Political Situation Has Taken on a New Atmosphere</h3>
<p>The Disturbances in Paris Have Suddenly Subsided</p>
<p>The General Strike is Scheduled for Monday</p>
<p>Aims to Uphold Democracy and Oppose Dictatorship</p>
<p>(Paris) The prelude to Doumergue's formation of a cabinet has given France a new atmosphere. Not only have disturbances subsided everywhere, but also French bonds and other securities have changed their old appearance in the market today and prices have risen. The new Prime Minister has received the full support of the Senate, and the House of Representatives, with the exception of the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and a small number of Radicals, also supports Mr. Doumergue. (Reuters Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Paris) This afternoon, when factories and shops closed, the situation was peaceful. Many curious people patrolled the places where disturbances occurred in the past two days, pointing and describing the incidents in detail, without excitement. The general public generally expressed sympathy for the move to appoint former President Doumergue to form a cabinet. In the evening, the capital was peaceful as usual. Only in outlying provinces such as Lyon were there still demonstrations, but no serious incidents occurred. (Havas Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The National Confederation of Labor issued a notice, advising all workers to stop working for twenty-four hours on Monday, which is intended to show that if anyone attempts to replace democracy with a dictatorship, the people will never sit idly by. General Secretary Stonhouse of the National Confederation of Labor declared that the purpose of the general strike movement by the National Confederation of Labor is not to disrupt the country and to allow the public to peacefully express its will only. The Postal Workers' Union, the Civil Servants' Union, the National Union of Elementary School Teachers, and the Education Union have all issued orders to hold a general strike for twenty-four hours on Monday.

<h3>Allied Support for Austrian Independence Resonates</h3>
<p>Rome Prepares Similar Declaration</p>
<p>German-Austrian Dispute Submitted to League of Nations</p>
<p>Considered Inopportune at Present</p>
<p>Documents on Austrian Case Sent to Major Powers to Clarify the Truth</p>
<p>Rome - It was recently announced in the British House of Commons that maintaining Austria's independence is the foundation of British foreign policy. This declaration is warmly welcomed here, and it is not impossible that a similar declaration may be made. People here believe that the only good policy regarding the current situation in Austria is to assist Austria in defending its independence, provide Austria with economic convenience, and enable Austria to have more contact with other Central European countries. As for Austria's political system, it is believed that National Socialism is a mysterious force, and Austria must resist it with another mysterious force. Furthermore, there is approval of the Austrian Chancellor's visit to Budapest, but it is not considered to be of great significance. In addition, Italy still considers it inappropriate for Austria to submit the German-Austrian dispute to the League of Nations, but if Austria insists on submitting it to the League of Nations, Italy will likely act in concert with other countries that support Austrian independence. (Havas News Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) - The Austrian State Council recently decided to allow Chancellor Dollfuss to submit the dispute between Germany and Austria to the League of Nations, and sent a thick file of documents on this matter to the major powers to clarify the truth. Today, the Austrian Minister to Britain delivered these documents to the Foreign Office. (Havas News Agency, 8th)</p>
<h3>Austrian Chancellor's Visit to Budapest a Success</h3>
<p>Return Trip Temporarily Postponed</p>
<p>Rome - Today's local newspapers reported that Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss and Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös discussed various issues concerning the interests of both countries, with completely satisfactory results. It is said that both prime ministers agreed to continue the current policies that have yielded satisfactory results, believing that the current administrative and economic cooperation between the two countries is not only beneficial to both countries, but also benefits the peace of all of Europe. The Hungarian Regent presented the Austrian Chancellor with the highest Cross of Merit. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>Budapest - Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss, who came here a few days ago to hold talks with Prime Minister Gömbös, was originally scheduled to return home last night, but temporarily postponed his trip to today due to feeling slightly unwell. However, some sources claim that Dollfuss' postponement of his return was actually due to worrying news coming from Vienna. Whether this is true remains to be seen. (Havas Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>Vienna - On September 10th of last year, Chancellor Dollfuss delivered an important political speech, saying that he would reject Marxism and National Socialism, maintain Austria's freedom and independence, and reform the constitution based on a professional group system. Recently, the Patriotic League of Tyrol Province launched a movement demanding that Dollfuss fully implement the reform measures he announced. This movement spread rapidly, and today the Patriotic Leagues of the provinces of Carinthia and Salzburg have joined. The leaders of the League will directly present their demands to Chancellor Dollfuss. (Havas Telegram, 8th)</p>
<h3>Political Crisis in Austria</h3>
<p>Home Guard Controls Administration of Two Provinces</p>
<p>Leftists Will Fight to Protect Themselves</p>
<p>Vienna - In view of the fact that the Home Guard has obtained full jurisdiction after implementing political changes in Tyrol and Upper Austria, implementing a semi-military administrative system, it is now implementing the same actions in the provinces of Styria and Burgenland, demanding the provincial governors: (1) to form a provincial government that is independent of political parties and should include representatives of the Home Guard; (2) to remove disloyal officials; (3) to appoint political affairs officers to unstable cities; (4) to appoint idle officials of the Home Guard as county magistrates; (5) to disband groups that resist the state. The provincial governors are currently dealing with them in a moderate manner, saying that they do not have the power to comply with the demands and must seek instructions from Vienna. It is expected that the leader of the Vienna Home Guard, Vice-Chancellor Fey, will lead a delegation to appear in the city council tomorrow to make the same demands. The Socialist Party and the Communist Party will fight to protect themselves today. It is said that if the Home Guard uses force, Vienna will be engulfed in flames. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>
<h3>US Ambassador Bullitt to Take Office in Russia at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>Progress in Trade Negotiations Between the Two Countries</p>
<p>(Washington) - After the resumption of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia, the first US Ambassador to Russia, Bullitt, went to Russia at the end of last year to present his credentials and make some arrangements, then returned to the United States to report to President Roosevelt on the process. Recently, Bullitt was scheduled to board a ship on February 15th to cross the ocean and take office in Russia. In addition, there has been significant progress in the negotiations between the United States and Russia on the debts owed to the United States by the Tsarist Russia, as well as other disputed points, and the trade agreement between the two countries.

<h3>Russo-Italian Friendship</h3>
<p>Extension of Trade Agreement Approved Through Exchange of Documents</p>
<p>Rome - The commercial agreement signed between Italy and Russia on May 6, 1933, was extended on December 5th of last year by representatives of the two countries signing a document. Today, Prime Minister Mussolini and the Soviet Russian Ambassador to Italy, Potemkin, exchanged ratification documents. Today is the tenth anniversary of the restoration of diplomatic relations between Italy and Russia. The Soviet Russian Ambassador said to the Italian Prime Minister that the Soviet Russian government was satisfied with the extension of the commercial agreement, which will further consolidate the friendship between the two nations. Potemkin also said (the friendship between Italy and Russia can be regarded as a major factor in maintaining peace). In addition, Soviet Russia will soon restore diplomatic relations with Hungary (recently, the Hungarian Minister to Turkey, Junger, exchanged documents with the Soviet Russian Ambassador Potemkin in Rome, recognizing Soviet Russia), and is deeply grateful for Italy's assistance. The Soviet Russian Ambassador expressed his gratitude to the Italian Prime Minister. Mussolini replied that Italy is willing to pursue a friendly policy with Russia in both political and economic terms. Since the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries ten years ago, Italy has always held this policy, and hopes that this policy can be further developed within the next ten years.

<h3>No Understanding Reached Between Britain and France, Trade War Inevitable</h3>
<p>Britain Will Impose Retaliatory Taxes on France</p>
<p>(London) - If France does not abolish its current severe attitude towards British imports before Monday, British customs will take retaliatory measures against France on that day. According to reliable sources today, if Britain and France cannot reach an understanding before the 12th, Britain will impose retaliatory tariffs on all French goods imported into the British Empire from that day onwards. If a trade war is inevitable, Britain has already implemented an economic war against the two countries, one being Ireland, both of which use tariffs as barriers to prevent the entry of goods. As of now, France has not shown any signs of retreating from Britain's demands. If a trade war is implemented, both sides will inevitably suffer losses, as France purchases millions of pounds worth of British goods each year. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>German Economy Stable</h3>
<p>Budget Surplus</p>
<p>Effect of Austerity Measures</p>
<p>(Berlin) - At a time when governments of various countries are facing financial difficulties, the German government alone has had a surplus since the beginning of the new year. This is not only a good phenomenon that has not been seen in Germany for many years, but also a unique economic stability situation in the world. Germany implemented austerity policies from the beginning of last year, and tax revenues were also quite strong, so the national treasury still had a surplus of 16.3 million marks at the end of the year. This shows that various industries in Germany have entered a period of recovery, and it is also clear evidence that the government's war on unemployment is gradually becoming effective. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>
<h3>Gold Flows Steadily to the United States</h3>
<p>(New York) - Since the implementation of the President's gold purchase plan, large quantities of gold have been imported into the United States every day. Today, the German postal ship Bremen arrived in New York, bringing gold bars worth 13 million yuan from various ports in Europe. The Panamanian liner will arrive tomorrow, carrying a large number of gold bars. According to the reasons for this round of gold inflow, one is due to the President's new monetary policy to collect gold, and the other is due to the gradual peace of the French political situation and the unrest in the political situation of various European countries.

<h3>Japanese House of Peers Rejects Fascism</h3>
<p>Prime Minister's Answer is Abstract</p>
<p>(Tokyo) - The House of Peers plenary session continued to meet at 1:45 PM today. First, Viscount Maeda Toshisada raised a question:</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of thought, that is, the issue of Fascism, raised by Mr. Seki Naohiko a few days ago, the government's answer at the time was quite unsatisfactory. Please explain in detail.</p>
<p>Prime Minister's answer:</p>
<p>The government is indeed trying to guide it well, in order to incorporate it into the correct track of constitutional government.</p>
<p>Mr. Maeda then raised the following three points:</p>
<p>(1) The Prime Minister seems to have the intention of guiding Fascist thought well. Then, what is its countermeasure?</p>
<p>(2) Has the government added a countermeasure for Fascism in the consultation plan of the Thought Countermeasures Committee?</p>
<p>(3) If it has been added, please explain its content.</p>
<p>Prime Minister's answer:</p>
<p>Regarding guiding thought, it is not limited to Fascism. It is entirely based on the fundamental spirit of impartiality and justice, and various efforts are made. Therefore, the Thought Countermeasures Consultative Council is also based on the above purpose.</p>
<p>Viscount Maeda stood up from his seat and said:</p>
<p>The Prime Minister's answer is entirely abstract and is too simple.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister did not answer further. The general question war on the speeches of the Ministers of State ended here. The meeting adjourned at 2:34 PM. (Japan United Press, 9th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) - Today, Mr. Kono Ichiro of the Seiyukai Party spoke in the fourth subcommittee of the House of Representatives as follows:</p>
<p>The military has published an opinion on the rural problem in the name of the Minister. Is it within the scope of application? Please explain.</p>
<p>Minister of the Army Hayashi answered:</p>
<p>The army's opinion on the rural problem outside its jurisdiction should be considered a mistake. I intend to absolutely not do this again from now on.</p>
<p>The Minister of the Army's statement of this attitude has attracted the attention of the general public. (Japan United Press, 9th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) - Minister of the Navy Osumi stated the following in response to a question raised by Mr. Yakaku Saburo of the Seiyukai Party regarding the issue of arms reduction in the fourth subcommittee of the House of Representatives' budget today:</p>
<p>(1) Ensure the security of Japan's national defense.</p>
<p>(2) Advocate amending the existing arms reduction treaty.</p>
<p>(3) Japan's national defense is not for invading others, but for defending itself.</p>
<p>(4) Maintaining the superiority of only one country, such arms reduction is unfair, so it is necessary to advocate the formulation of a fair and appropriate concrete plan. (Japan United Press, 9th)</p>

<p>Government Loans for New Ships</p>
<p>Develop North Atlantic Routes</p>
<p>(London) - Financial Under-Secretary Bailey Shaw reported in the House of Commons this afternoon that the British Cunard Steamship Company and the Oceanic Steam Navigation Company have reached an agreement to merge the North Atlantic Cunard and White Star routes.

The British government has allowed this agreement to take effect, but on the main condition that the new shipping group is still managed by British people. (Havas Telegram, 8th)</p>

<h3>Naval Expert Ackworth Elaborates on the British Navy and the Future War</h3>
<p>If War Breaks Out in 1936</p>
<p>Japan Will Inevitably Occupy Hong Kong, Singapore, and Australia</p>
<p>Britain Can Be Fearless if it Rushes to Build Cruisers</p>
<p>(London) - Naval Captain Ackworth has written a book on naval issues, titled (The British Navy and the Future War). Ackworth is a naval expert, and his book criticizes the weaknesses of the British Navy, saying that Britain has historically shouldered a major mission in the world, especially in the Far East, but its navy is far inferior to Japan's. The author specifically criticizes the (Rodney)-class armored ships and the newly built (Dan Steel) destroyer, saying that the armament and speed of these warships are insufficient and cannot cope with war. Ackworth concludes that if the British Navy does not change its course, the consequences of a British-Japanese war in 1936 will be disastrous. Once a war breaks out in the Far East, Japan will attack Hong Kong. The main force of the British Navy is 10,000 nautical miles away, and Hong Kong is a base that is completely unsuitable for defense. Once contact is made, there is no chance of winning. Because the Japanese Navy is currently preparing for war, its attack on Hong Kong will carry marines. On the fourth day after the war, Hong Kong will be surrounded, and within fifteen days, Hong Kong will no longer belong to the British. Once Hong Kong is lost, Singapore will inevitably fall into the hands of the Japanese, and even Australia will become a part of Japan's possession. Ackworth concludes that the most suitable warship for modern naval needs is an armored cruiser of more than 11,000 tons, with a speed of 17.5 nautical miles per hour, equipped with 13.5-inch caliber guns. Ackworth believes that if the British Far East Fleet, excluding second-class warships, has 15 more armored cruisers of the above type, it can be fearless. When war breaks out, the British Far East Fleet can rely on its own strength to threaten the communication of the Japanese fleet before the reinforcements sent by the home country arrive, and prevent it from succeeding. Ackworth also strongly advocates that the British fleet should use coal as fuel in the future (as opposed to using heavy oil). (Havas Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) - Today, the British Admiralty officially denied the news published in the Rainer's Illustrated News last Sunday, saying that the Royal Navy conference held in Singapore this time had resolved to build a solid naval base between the Falkland Islands, so that when a conflict occurs between Japan and the United States in the future, Britain can protect its rights in the Far East. The report also claimed that if Japan and the United States go to war, the Panama Canal will be blocked, so Britain will contact the Australian and New Zealand fleets, build fortifications between the Falkland Islands, and protect British ships that can pass through the Strait of Magellan.

<h3>Russian Army Ready for Battle</h3>
<p>Declaration by the Commander of the Red Army in the Far East</p>
<p>Reval - According to Moscow reports, General Blyukher, Commander of the Russian Army in the Far East, made a boastful speech during a large-scale review held today to commemorate the 17th Communist Party Congress. After Blyukher declared his loyalty to Stalin and endorsed the policies of the Communist Party, he went on to say that the entire Russian army is ready for battle and ready to cope with emergencies. If Russia is attacked, our army can fulfill its responsibility without any effort. At the same time, the War Revolutionary Committee issued an order to the army to praise Stalin and said that the Red Army is the only army in the world that does not practice imperialism or occupy foreign land. The Red Army is combined with the National Party, and its sole purpose is to safeguard peace. However, our blades have been sharpened, and we will slay anyone who attempts to endanger the peaceful efforts of our socialist land. We will annihilate anyone who attempts to cross the border.

<h3>Former US Aviation Director Strongly Advocates Expanding the Air Force</h3>
<p>US Private Aircraft Factories Make Huge Profits</p>
<p>(Washington) - The House of Representatives Aviation Committee recently received a report stating that aircraft manufacturers made a profit of 90 percent on orders from the army in 1932. In addition, from 1928 to the first few months of 1933, the factory sold aircraft worth a total of US$45,529,000 to the army. The House Aviation Committee is currently investigating this matter. Colonel Mitchell, the former aviation director who resigned in 1926, fiercely attacked the government's policy of entrusting private companies to manufacture military aircraft in the House Aviation Committee, saying that the US Air Force is equivalent to nothing compared to Europe. This is the truth, but the general public is afraid to say it. Mitchell also criticized former Presidents Coolidge and Hoover for failing to develop military aviation. He then attacked the naval battleship construction policy, saying that only aircraft and submarines would be useful in future wars. Finally, Mitchell advocated that air stations must be built in Alaska, Hawaii, and the Philippines. (Havas Telegram, 9th)</p>

<h3>Cai Tingkai's Departure from the 19th Route Army</h3>
<p>Cai Was Besieged by Militia in Shizhong</p>
<p>Guangdong Army's Huang Division Stationed in Yongding and Longyan</p>
<p>Xiamen Communication: Cai Tingkai's whereabouts have been unknown since he led his troops west to Longyan on January 21. According to recent sources from Shizhong and Longyan, Cai left Quanzhou for Zhangzhou on the morning of the 21st, with approximately 200 guards and a battalion of the Special Service Regiment under Li Jinbo. Upon arriving in Zhangzhou, together with 600-700 students from the Zhishan Military Officer Training Class, a regiment of the Fourth Army under Zhang Yan led by Zhou Lixing, and a regiment of the Political Guard Division under Xu Minghong, totaling over 4,000 men, and 20-odd trucks loaded with firearms, ammunition, and artillery shells, they proceeded to Shizhong via Nanjing. Before abandoning Zhangzhou, Xu Minghong also transported a portion of the ammunition stored in Zhangzhou to Hexi, which was also transported to Shizhong along the way. Cai and his troops arrived in Shizhong on the 23rd. Xu Minghong immediately led a regiment of the Guard Division to Longyan, while Cai led 2,000 troops to station in Shizhong without retreating. Cai believed that Longyan was an isolated city that could not be defended, and Shizhong was a natural stronghold with hundreds of well-known pillboxes. The location was also a strategic area where Longyan and Zhangzhou met, serving to defend against the Central Army from Zhangzhou and safeguard Longyan. Furthermore, the troops of Li from Anxi Chang'an could be received after their retreat, enabling both offensive and defensive operations, and also accommodating the troops coming from Quanzhou. After Cai arrived in Shizhong, he stationed himself in the largest and most famous Yangyun pillbox, deploying Shizhong's defenses. However, the leader of the Shizhong militia, who had been detained by Cai Tingkai for years, escaped from prison in Shizhong when Zhangzhou was in crisis. Xie Yangqi, the former head of the Shizhong militia, was commissioned by Yang Fengnian, the commander of the Southern Fujian Militia, as the commander of the Fifth Detachment of the Southern Fujian Anti-Rebel Army. Xie immediately mobilized the Shizhong militia to form the Anti-Rebel Army, first burning four wooden bridges above Shizhong leading to Longyan. Zhang Shiyu, the commander of the Fourth Detachment, also burned the bridges between Zhangzhou and Shizhong. On the 25th, Xie joined forces with the militia under Guo Xingmin, totaling approximately 2,000 men, surrounding the pillbox occupied by Cai. The people of Shizhong were extremely fierce, with guns in every household, and they were very familiar with the terrain. As a result, Cai and his troops were heavily besieged until the 28th.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the news in Longyan, Xu Minghong immediately sent Fu Baicui with his 2,000-strong Western Fujian Volunteer Corps from Shanghang to reinforce them, coordinating internal and external efforts. Cai then led his troops to break out of the encirclement and arrived at Daxiaochi southwest of Longyan on the 29th. Cai's original intention in staying in Shizhong was to receive the troops from Quanzhou, hoping to reorganize and form an army. However, the troops in Quanzhou were reorganized due to Mao Weishou and Zhang Yan's defection, and he was also trapped in Shizhong, deeply realizing that the situation was hopeless. Thus, he left the army on the 29th. Regarding Cai's whereabouts after leaving the army, some said he went to Changting, while others said he went to Fengshi in Shanghang and entered Chaozhou and Shantou towards Hong Kong. Judging from his telegram, he was not willing to defect to the communists, so it is more likely that he went to Guangdong and then to Hong Kong. After Xu Minghong arrived in Longyan, he ordered Fu Baicui to reinforce Cai while leading his own Guard Division and Volunteer Corps of 1,000-2,000 men west to Changting. Changting is still a bandit area, so it is rumored that Xu went to join the communists. After Xu left, no one was in charge of Longyan. After Cai retreated to Daxiaochi, he did not enter the city and left the army to go elsewhere. After Fu Baicui retreated, he returned to his hometown of Jiaoyang in Shanghang. Zhou Lixing led 2,000 troops to station in Daxiaochi. Therefore, since February 1, only a small number of the former Western Fujian Post-Rehabilitation Office Volunteer Corps remained in the city of Longyan. Other than that, there was not a single soldier. When Cai left the army, the Guangdong army had already entered Shanghang and Wuping. Zhou Lixing sent someone to request incorporation into the Guangdong army under Huang Renhuan. Huang then sent two regiments to station in Kanshi and one regiment to station in Yongding. On the 4th, dozens of vanguards of the Guangdong army entered the county seat of Longyan. According to someone from Yongding on the 6th, the First and Third Regiments of Zeng Youren's Brigade of Huang Renhuan's Division of the Guangdong army entered the county seat of Longyan on the 5th, while the Second Regiment entered the county seat of Yongding on the 4th, stationed inside and outside the county seat. Personnel from the former Western Fujian Post-Rehabilitation Office all fled. The people of Yongding elected Lin Yunbo as the county magistrate of Yongding. Since the Guangdong army entered the city of Longyan, the military has temporarily maintained order. Personnel from the former Western Fujian Post-Rehabilitation Office have fled with Xu Minghong. The Chamber of Commerce is convening meetings with various sectors, but no one has come forward to take on political affairs. (February 7th)</p>
<h3>Situation After the Inauguration of the New Provincial Committee of Fujian</h3>
<p>Xu Fu Temporarily Maintains the Department of Finance</p>
<p>Chiang Ting-wen is Deploying Troops to Suppress Bandits</p>
<p>Fuzhou Communication: Provincial government members Chen Yi, Zheng Zhenwen, Chen Ticheng, Xu Fu, Li Shijia, and Lin Zhiyuan were sworn in on the 5th. Various departments also began work on the 6th. The heads of the secretariat are all newly appointed, and most of the other staff members are old employees who have been re-employed. However, due to financial difficulties, the expenses of various agencies have been reduced by a quarter compared to the original budget, so the number of personnel has also been reduced by a third. Salaries are generally calculated from February, so most civil servants lose two months of salary, with some losing one month. However, Sun Jiaze, the director of the Department of Finance, is currently in Guangdong and has not yet arrived in Fujian. The position is temporarily held by Xu Fu, who is only willing to maintain it for a month. If Sun does not come again, the central government will be asked to appoint a special commissioner. It was previously rumored that Du Qiyun would be the director of the Fujian Security Office. Du came to the province a few days ago and met with Chen Yi on the 3rd. The military commission's order to revoke the title of military special envoy has been received. There are two views on the Security Office: one is that there is already a security commander, and the Security Office will be temporarily delayed; the other is that the Security Office will be scaled down and attached to the provincial government, with Chen Yi concurrently serving as the director, and the newly appointed security commander, Xiao Qian, flew from Hangzhou to the province on the afternoon of the 6th to meet with Chiang Ting-wen and Chen Yi to discuss the problem of organizing the provincial security</p>
<p>teams. The headquarters will likely be organized within a few days.</p>
<p>Chiang Ting-wen has not yet decided on the date of taking office as the new commander-in-chief of the Eastern Route Bandit Suppression. He has been extremely busy in recent days deploying bandit suppression matters. Regarding the bandit situation in northern Fujian, it was most rampant in late January, with four counties, Shunchang, Jiangle, Yong'an, and Shaxian, falling in succession. In the past ten days, through the concerted efforts of various armies in encirclement and suppression, the bandit momentum has gradually subsided. The Red bandits entrenched in Shaxian have been attacked from both sides by the Lu Xingbang and Leng Xin Divisions, and their strength has been depleted. They have already retreated towards Jiangle. The Leng Division is approaching the county seat. However, the county seat of Shouning in eastern Fujian has been captured by local Red bandits, who looted extensively, burning over a thousand shops. Yesterday, Chiang Ting-wen ordered the Chen Qixuan Division to send troops to suppress them. Furthermore, local communists in the coastal areas of Lianjiang County, such as Mabi, Toujie, and Feiluan, have been encircled and suppressed by the Wei Duo Regiment of the Marine Corps. The bandit crowds have disintegrated. However, the local area has been devastated by the bandit fires, and the people have fled almost completely, urgently awaiting government relief.

<h3>Sun Dianying's Troops Intensify Attack on Ningyuan</h3>
<p>|He Yingqin Decides to Send Another Representative to Shanxi|</p>
<p>Beiping Dispatch: After the Military Affairs Commission dismissed Sun Dianying from all his posts, Sun has not yet complied with the order. Although he telegraphed He Yingqin, expressing his willingness to relinquish military power, he is determined not to leave the army. Yu Shiming, Liu Yueting, and Ding Futing have also not responded to the Military Affairs Commission's order to them to take responsibility for leading the reorganization and downsizing of Sun's army. He Yingqin, considering Sun's refusal to leave the army and suspecting he has other intentions, deemed it inappropriate to approve his request. Furthermore, in recent days, Sun's army has intensified its attack on Ningyuan. Today, there are even reports that Sun's army has captured Ningcheng. As for the Ningxia front, according to a telegram from Ma Hongkui, fierce fighting continues near Ningyuan. Sun's army has suffered heavy casualties. On the 5th, at dawn, over two hundred members of Sun's army's dare-to-die corps, carrying ladders to scale the city walls, were met with machine gun fire, resulting in over a hundred deaths and the capture of their captain, Xiao Yongxian, and seventy other soldiers. Their main force is lying in wait in villages around Zhujiazhai and Lijiazhai, six or seven li southwest of Ningyuan, waiting for an opportunity to attack. On the same day, Sun's Xia brigade and other units were surrounded, resulting in over a thousand deaths and the capture of significant war spoils. It is also reported that the Xia brigade commander and over twenty officers were killed in action.</p>
<p>He Yingqin plans to send Hou Cheng to Shanxi again within the next few days to meet with Yan Xishan and discuss the dispatch of troops and transit matters. If Yan is aligned with the central government, not only will Guan and Liu's units immediately begin their encirclement, but Xu Tingyao's unit stationed in Baoding can also transfer via the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan Railway, transiting through Shanxi province to the junction of Shanxi, Suiyuan, and Ningxia, to carry out a siege of Sun's forces. Recently, Men Bingyue has also been in Suiyuan, consulting with Fu Zuoyi on the issues of Shanxi and Suiyuan provinces providing transit for troops. Zhang Guanwu, who had previously mediated the situation, is traveling from Beiping to Tianjin tonight to visit Sun Dianying's representative, Hu Jiesan, in a final attempt to find a resolution. Before his departure, Zhang expressed to others that since the situation has escalated to this extent, even if there is only a glimmer of hope for a turnaround, he must still do his utmost to seek peace of mind.

<h3>The Eunuchs of the Puppet Regime of Pu Yi</h3>
<p>A Certain Country's Rōnin Orchestrates Celebrations</p>
<p>Eunuchs Secretly Discuss Scandalous Conduct</p>
<p>Beiping Dispatch: As the puppet Pu Yi's "ascension to the throne" approaches, former Qing dynasty officials residing in Beiping, driven by greed, are seizing the opportunity to seek positions within the puppet organization. A certain country's rōnin recently gathered elderly Manchus and a small number of disillusioned politicians in a villa in Tianjin to discuss plans for celebrating Pu Yi's ascension. They decided to send representatives to meet Pu Yi and present him with a yellow dragon robe. Today (the 8th), Fu Rukun, a representative of the Manchus in Tianjin, secretly arrived in Beiping. After disembarking, he visited Manchus and disillusioned politicians in the Shichahai, Houhai, Di'anmen, Yinding Bridge, and Beixinqiao areas. The Yanyan Hall in Shichahai, a former Qing imperial banquet hall, hosted four former Qing eunuchs, aged around sixty, for dinner tonight at seven o'clock. Observers noted that these eunuchs still had queues and spoke in feminine tones. Dressed in yellow or orange-yellow robes, they discussed the Qing dynasty's benevolence towards the Manchus and falsely praised the new facilities of the puppet regime. One of them, wearing a mandarin jacket, said that as Xuantong's enthronement was imminent, Manchus should regularly visit the Manchu Emperor, who would surely bestow blessings. Another, wearing an orange-yellow fox fur robe, interjected, saying that Xuantong was young and ignorant, surrounded by Zheng Xiaoxu and others; elderly men like them might not have beneficial opportunities to approach. Instead, they should send a jointly signed congratulatory letter first and determine their next course of action based on the response. Another, wearing a yellow sheepskin robe, said that the situation in Manchukuo was complicated, with the Easterners (Japanese) controlling the government; Xuantong was merely a wooden puppet, performing a wooden puppet show. They, as old eunuchs from the Guangxu Emperor's era, did not need to serve this wooden puppet emperor. Yet another, wearing a yellow cotton robe, said that regardless of whether Manchukuo treated Manchus well, now that Xuantong was about to ascend the throne, they should make some kind of expression. After discussion, the four old eunuchs decided to reply to the Tianjin Manchu representatives, agree on a unified course of action, send representatives to Tianjin to participate in a joint meeting of Beiping and Tianjin Manchu representatives, and discuss the steps for going to the Northeast and the methods for celebrating Pu Yi. How unsightly! (8th)</p>
<h3>Headquarters Promotes Political Education and Production Cooperation</h3>
<p>Circular Orders to the Three Provinces, Instructing Four Points</p>
<p>Implementation Scheduled to Begin This March</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: The Bandit Suppression Headquarters of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, on the 8th, issued circular orders to the three provincial governments, instructing four points regarding political education and production cooperation. The order states: (Politics, education, and production are fundamental tasks for national salvation today and are the foundation for national rejuvenation. Examining the great powers, after periods of destruction, they all quickly rose up to catch up, embedding production in education as an effective measure. Using each other for mutual benefit, striving to become strong, and working diligently are crucial for success. When the Commander-in-Chief oversaw Wuhan in previous years, he deeply understood that without clarifying politics, there would be no way to eliminate the source of chaos, and without smelting education and production into one furnace, there would be no way to achieve social stability. In the previous year, an order was issued as secret number 647, planning the construction of education cooperation, and subsequently, an order was issued as secret number 539, promulgating the general outlines of the principles for the implementation of political education, educational production, and productive education, all on record. Now, it is observed that many commissioners and the provincial departments of construction and education are able to implement these principles faithfully according to laws and regulations, but there are also those who are still planning or whose management is lacking. Further instructions are hereby given as follows: (1) Each commissioner's stationed location, if a farm or agricultural and forestry experimental school has not yet been prepared and established, a written plan must be drafted within ten days of the receipt of this order, submitted separately to the responsible agency for approval, and then presented for review; no further delays are allowed. (2) Rural lecture classes are especially important. If they have not been established in each commissioner's stationed location, they should be prepared immediately. In addition, each responsible agency should investigate and consider the conditions in each county and establish them as appropriate. (3) To cultivate a spirit of enduring hardship and service, teachers and students should all be practically engaged in cultivation. Therefore, the number of workers at each farm should be limited to two, and the number of workers at agricultural schools should be limited to four. Established farms and agricultural schools should implement this principle starting from March of the 23rd year. (4) The general outline of the principles for implementing political education, educational production, and productive education, items two, three, and four, are crucial to production education and political reform. Each commissioner's work reports and inspection reports should be carefully assessed and reported to the ministry item by item and article by article. The provincial departments of construction and education should especially assess each school, each factory, and each farm at any time to determine whether they are diligently improving according to the general outline of the principles, and they should report the improvement status at any time. The above-mentioned key points, in addition to being distributed separately, are hereby urgently ordered to be followed and implemented by the provincial governments, and all subordinates should be instructed to comply with them. The date of receipt of this document should be reported for verification. This order is of utmost importance.) (February 8th)</p>
<h3>The Sichuan-Kangding Inspection Group Inspects the Construction of Beibei</h3>
<p>|Various New Enterprises Are Highly Developed|</p>
<p>Shanghai Reporter: The Sichuan-Kangding Inspection Group arrived in Chongqing on the Democracy steamship on the afternoon of January 29th. On the 30th, they inspected the city and learned that Chongqing is built on a hillside, surrounded by water on three sides, making development difficult. However, the newly built roads outside the city are very impressive. The water company, which cost three million, is also very grand. The power plant, which is currently under construction, has a capacity of three thousand kilowatts, using steam turbine engines, and is very innovative. It is said that there is a waterfall two hundred li away in Changshou. If it could be used to generate electricity, it would have about three thousand horsepower available. There are also well-equipped schools and agricultural experimental fields, so the future is promising. On the afternoon of January 31st, various circles in Chongqing held a welcoming party at the Chamber of Commerce. Among the representatives were refugees who had escaped from the bandit-controlled areas, who painfully recounted their tragic experiences, with tears in their voices. The Chongqing press also hosted a banquet, and the two sides exchanged experiences. On February 2nd, they took a small boat north along the Jialing River, passing through Guanyin Gorge and arriving at Beibei. The clear waves and green hills were like a scene from springtime Jiangnan. Beibei is located between Libi Hot Springs, Guanyin, and the Three Gorges, and is a new village run by Lu Zuofu, Huang Zishang, and others. Ten years ago, it was a place haunted by bandits. Lu and others first formed a group to maintain security, and then cooperated with the residents to create various new enterprises, such as the Western China Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Physics and Chemistry, to engage in scientific exploration of the natural world in the west. In addition, there are the Jian Shan Middle School, the Civilian School, the Library (with 13,000 books), the Children's Library, the Civilian Hospital, the Public Sports Field, the Museum, and the Zoo. Although the various facilities are simple, they can maximize their function. There is also a very large Civilian Park for public recreation. In terms of productive enterprises, there is a dyeing and weaving factory that produces daily-use cloth. On the opposite bank of the river is the Beichuan Railway, which is only thirty li long and is used to transport coal from the mines to the docks, making a great contribution to the national economy and the people's livelihood. The Jialing Hotel is located above the hot spring gorge, inside the hot spring park, with an excellent environment. The waiters in the hotel are high school graduates aged fifteen or sixteen, called service students. They take care of everything for the travelers during the day, and at night they take turns guarding the night with live ammunition. Because the area is located in a secluded valley, there are often bandits, so residents must defend themselves. On the 4th, they boarded a ship from Beibei to return to Chongqing, and were scheduled to depart for Chengdu tomorrow morning. (Sent from Chongqing on the 5th)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Unseals Frozen Rent</h3>
<p>Frozen Rent Used to Maintain Finance</p>
<p>First Phase Matures, Unsealed and Interest Paid</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Previously, due to the paper currency crisis in Guangdong Province, the government, under the pretext of maintaining finance and reducing the amount of paper currency in circulation in the market, announced that it would borrow one month's rent from shops and households in Guangzhou City, with tenants acting as agents for sealing it up. At that time, it was stipulated that the freeze period would be either two months or three months. Now that the two-month period has expired, the rent should be unsealed and interest paid. The first phase of borrowed rent is scheduled to be unsealed today (the 6th). The City Chamber of Commerce and the Elementary School Joint Association have been selected as the locations for the Guangdong Provincial Bank to unseal the rent and pay interest. The dates and methods for unsealing and paying interest are as follows: (1) The rent will be unsealed according to the number of days borrowed, averaged into two phases. The first phase is from December 6th, 22nd year to December 22nd of the same month, excluding weekly holidays, totaling fifteen days. Those who borrowed during this period will unseal after two months. The second phase is from December 23rd, 22nd year to January 13th, 23rd year, excluding weekly holidays, totaling sixteen days. Those who borrowed during this period will unseal after three months. (2) The unsealing of rent will be handled by an office organized by the Finance Department and the Provincial Bank. (3) The rent will be unsealed in the order of the borrowing date, and the bank will compile a table of unsealing dates and inform the public. (4) Those who have sealed up rent for shops should bring the original sealed rent to the office on the date specified in the announcement to have it verified and unsealed for interest payment. Those who do not arrive on time will have to wait until all the procedures are completed before they can proceed. They may not request a make-up on the day after the due date. (5) Interest on borrowed rent will be calculated at a monthly rate of eight per mille, and will be paid for either two months or three months. However, if the scheduled date exceeds two months or three months, the excess days will still be calculated for interest on a daily basis to ensure fairness. However, for those who do not come on time and delay until after all procedures are completed, interest will only be calculated up to the due date. The rent borrowing this time is based on the date of borrowing, the number of households sealed on that day, and the number of days to be processed. Because the first phase of borrowers was very enthusiastic, with as many as ten thousand households being sealed each day, and the number of sealed households in the second phase was very small, the procedures can be completed in a short period. The unsealing dates are divided into phases. For example, after the first phase is completed, the second phase will be compiled. The first unsealing dates are February 6th to 7th, February 8th to 13th, February 19th to 24th, and February 26th to March 6th. (February 6th)</p>

<h3>Longxing Township Robbery Case Solved</h3>
<p>The family of Chen Youquan, a villager from Xiaoqiujing, Tu 6, Longxing Bridge Township, north of Bailongtan in this city, was suddenly attacked by more than ten bandits at about 12 o'clock last night (the 8th). They broke in through a side door. A bandit holding a handgun led three bandits inside, first tying up the farmhand, then entering Youquan's bedroom, tying up Youquan's mother and wife, and torturing them to reveal the location of hidden money. Chen Youquan's family had no savings to offer, so they ransacked the room, stealing a pair of gold earrings, clothes, etc., and fled with a whoop. The victim was severely injured from the beatings. This morning, he came to Songjiang to see Dr. Zheng Xionfei for treatment. While passing Changqiao, he caught sight of Zhuang Dakui, one of the bandits who had been at the scene last night, and the most aggressive one. He immediately called for help and had him apprehended, and handed over to the Second Branch Police Station. Zhuang Dakui confessed that there were two other accomplices, A Luan and A Zhang, hiding in a tailor shop in Cangqiao. Police were dispatched to Cangqiao, and the two bandits were arrested and taken back to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. It is said that after the interrogation, they will be handed over to the county government for severe punishment.</p>

<h3>Carpenter and Painter Steal Hidden Gold</h3>
<p>The Pan family of Baoji Bridge, Dongbaitazi Alley, Sucheng, has been a prominent family for generations, with considerable wealth. Their descendants Yonglin (third branch), Ruoshi (fourth branch), and Yongdong (fifth branch) separated and lived separately ten years ago, with a total of 1.8 million divided into five shares. Their old residence is deep and winding. It is said that when a concubine of the eldest branch died, because she had no descendants, she secretly buried cash and jewelry in the house, accumulating a considerable treasure. A certain painter in the east of the city, who owns considerable wealth, suddenly became rich several years ago. It is said that he found part of the hidden treasure while repairing the house. However, Yonglin and others had no evidence and let it go. Recently, about ten days ago, Zhu Asan, a carpenter regularly hired by the Pan family, and the painter Miao Zhiyun (who now runs the Miao Taicheng Lacquerware Store at No. 189 Lindun Road), were working at the residence when they suddenly discovered an official box in the ceiling. When they opened it, they were shocked to see a pile of gold and silver. They secretly carried it to Miao's store, where they weighed it and found one hundred taels of gold arhats and other pure gold, two hundred Japanese gold coins, and four hundred and ten silver dollars. They immediately split it up. Miao got eighty taels of pure gold, Zhu got twenty taels, and they split the remaining items in half. Afterwards, a apprentice in Miao's store found out and gradually leaked it out. Miao had no choice but to confess to the Pan family. The Pan family then filed a request with the Public Security Bureau, ordering the Mudu Branch Bureau to send police to Zhu Asan's home in Xiangshan, arrest Zhu in the city, and recover the stolen gold that Zhu had deposited at No. 4 Pingjiang Road. On the 8th, Pan Yonglin and others lured Miao Zhiyun to the Public Security Bureau and had him arrested. It is said that at the time when the concubine buried the gold, there was also a booklet in the official box, which noted all the gold and silver buried in various places. To clarify the total amount of hidden treasure, the first step is to track down this booklet. In the evening, after a secret interrogation by the Public Security Bureau, Miao Zhiyun, Zhu Asan, and Jin Nan, an apprentice at Miao's store, confessed that they had indeed weighed and divided the stolen gold and other items at Miao's store. The three were sent back to prison. On the evening of the 8th, a detective team, together with the police station in charge, raided Miao's store. This incident caused a sensation in society. It is said that after Miao received the stolen gold, he put part of it in a chamber pot. Later, when Miao confessed, he had two buckets transported to Ruoshi, a member of the Pan clan. This was seen by a night watchman at the Zhixiang pawnshop nearby, so there was also some infighting among the Pan clan.</p>

<h3>Small Carpenter Chops Paramour to Death</h3>
<p>Cheng Jinxiang, who is from Nanshi Shao of Datuan Town in the fifth district, has been having an affair with Xia, the wife of Chen Aqiu, a small carpenter. Because Chen is addicted to morphine injections and lives in poverty, he uses this to supplement his income, so he knowingly ignores the affair between Chen and Xia. However, Cheng is quite stingy. For many years, he has not spent much. Recently, Chen, because the end of the lunar year was approaching and he could not repay his debts, gathered a person the night before last, and when Cheng was secretly meeting with Xia, they broke down the door and tied up Cheng with a rope, demanding fifty yuan. Because Cheng refused, Chen stabbed Cheng's leg three times with an awl. Although blood flowed freely, Cheng still refused. Chen became extremely angry and chopped Cheng's head with an axe, immediately splitting his eyes and nose. Cheng died instantly. Chen and others, seeing that they had caused trouble, transported Cheng's body to the side of the road in Fengxian. Yesterday morning, the body was discovered and reported to the district office and public security bureau of the town for inspection. The murderer was arrested and a flannel blood-stained shirt, as well as an axe and iron awl with blood stains, were found in his home. A floor with blood stains was also found in front of the bed. All were sent to the county for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Aunt Killing Case Opens for Interrogation</h3>
<p>Chen Wang, the wife of Chen Baogen, the owner of the Chen Tingji woodworking shop in Lixiang, outside the West Gate, was chopped three times with an axe in the middle of the night on the 26th of last month by her nephew Feng AqI, Chen Qibao, and her own daughter, Chen Cuiyun. Her brain matter splattered and she died immediately. The Fourth Branch of the Public Security Bureau arrested the murderers and sent them to the court. After repeated interrogations, Qibao confessed to having an affair with Cuiyun and being discovered by his aunt, leading him to kill her out of resentment. Later, he suddenly retracted his confession. Yesterday, the prosecutor from the Prosecutor's Office summoned Chen Baogen, the husband of the deceased, to court for questioning. According to his testimony, the key points in the case are: (1) Several days before the incident, Qibao borrowed a handgun from his friend. When his friend asked what it was for, he said he was going out to start a business. Qibao was silent, but the gun was not borrowed. (2) On the day of the incident, after ten o'clock at night, Qibao opened the door and went out. When asked what he was doing, he said he was urinating. The witness said that there was a chamber pot for urination, so why go out? Qibao then changed his story and said he was defecating. A few hours later, Wang was hacked to death. The prosecutor considered the above two points to be of great importance, and continued to question Qibao for a long time before ordering him to be returned to prison. Chen Baogen was ordered to return home.</p>

<h3>Prosecutor Investigates the Case of Falsely Accusing Good People of Theft</h3>
<p>The case of Jin Jishan, the former director of the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau, falsely accusing Li Shouqi, a good citizen, of theft, and torturing him to death, has been investigated and concluded by the county government. It was ruled that Patrolman Huang Tianjia and Gatekeeper Cao Jiapin, jointly abused the power and opportunity of their positions to injure others. Each was sentenced to one year of imprisonment and one year of deprivation of civil rights. Jin Jishan is at large, and the trial will be suspended in order. Li Yu's widow believed that the ruling was inappropriate since the main culprit was still at large, and the injustice had not been redressed, she appealed to the Shanghai Local Court. Based on the circumstances, the court sent Prosecutor Tang Ruxiu and Clerk Li Tingfan from Shanghai to Jiading on the morning of the 8th to investigate. They met with County Magistrate Xu Cixuan, Judge Shao Ling, Education Association Executive Lu Shunxiang, and others to inquire about everything in detail.</p>

<h3>Case of Altering Aviation Lottery Tickets</h3>
<p>Yang Youheng, the director of the Liuhaisha Public Security Branch Bureau, received a fifth prize of 200 yuan for the third phase of the Aviation Lottery Tickets from the Bank of China in Nantong, ticket number 227404.

<h3>Ministry of Communications Prepares for International Wireless Telephone</h3>
<p>Has Successfully Tested with England, America, France, and Germany</p>
<p>After Success, Machines Will Be Purchased for Formal Calls</p>
<p>Huadong News Agency reports: Since the Ministry of Communications successfully established direct wireless communication with England, it has been preparing for further convenience and is planning to implement mutual wireless telephone communication with European countries. Tests are currently underway and have been conducted with Germany, the United States, and England, with excellent results. A long-term test is planned, and after its success, a wireless telephone machine will be purchased from a foreign country specifically for formal communication with other countries.</p>
<h3>Test Calls with Various Countries</h3>
<p>After the establishment of direct central international wireless communication, the Ministry of Communications immediately ordered the International Telecommunications Bureau, in its spare time from Sino-British communication, to still use the Sino-British radio station to conduct mutual wireless telephone communication, so that clear language can be heard from thousands of miles away. This matter has been worked hard by the Bureau, and communication is possible with excellent results. Initially, the Bureau conducted a test call with the wireless radio station in Berlin, Germany, using clear and gentle German. Later, Liu Chongjie, the ambassador to Germany, and Liu Hongsheng, the general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, talked to each other for a long time. The other day, the station invited the German Ruituo from Siemens in this city to hold a call with Berlin, Germany. The Berlin radio station was relayed to the small city of Düssqfdort, 500 miles away from Berlin, and it was able to obtain good sound waves, as if it were right in front of you. After obtaining this result, the station held calls with London, England, and New York, USA, and the results were also good. It is now planned to carry out calls with Paris, the capital of France.</p>
<h3>Continued Research</h3>
<p>After the International Telecommunications Bureau successfully tested calls with various countries, it believed that although the results of this call were good, it was not yet fully confident, so it continued to research and planned to conduct test calls with various countries again using the Sino-British wireless radio station. However, the station has been very busy recently and has very few free times, so it can only hold test calls for a few hours each week, so it is difficult to determine when it can be completely successful.</p>
<h3>Purchasing Telephones</h3>
<p>After the Bureau successfully conducted wireless telephone trials with various countries, it will soon formally accept commercial telegrams. However, due to the current heavy workload of the machinery, it is unable to spare time to receive and transmit telephone calls. Therefore, it plans to purchase another wireless telephone machine from abroad in the near future, specifically for telephone communication with various countries. When successful in the future, we will be able to converse with acquaintances thousands of miles away.</p>

<h3>New Loan Usage by the Ministry of Finance</h3>
<p>Part to the Economic Commission</p>
<p>The Remainder for Military and Administrative Expenses</p>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, the new loan of 44 million from Shanghai banking circles by the Ministry of Finance is secured by the returned Boxer Indemnity, which former Minister of Finance Song Ziwen had been negotiating in Italy. The establishment of this new loan owes much to the efforts of Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, who benefited from Song Ziwen's assistance. Therefore, in addition to a large portion of this new loan going to the Ministry of Finance for military and administrative expenses, a portion will also be allocated to the Economic Commission to be used for construction expenses.</p>

Starting this morning, he has been able to take small amounts of milk and other nutrients. However, in order to thoroughly treat the root cause of the illness, it was originally planned to perform surgery. However, due to his still weak constitution, it was not dared to perform heavy surgery lightly. Even stronger X-ray radiation was not used, only mild X-ray radiation was used, so the location of the lesion could not be seen because the power was very weak.</p>

<h3>China's Tung Oil Exports Increased Significantly Last Year</h3>
<p>A Quarter More Than in the 21st Year of the Republic of China</p>
<p>Most Widely Used in the United States, Britain, and Hong Kong</p>
<p>According to the International Trade Bureau yesterday, Tung oil is one of China's special products and an indispensable raw material for the paint manufacturing industry. It is mostly produced in Sichuan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and the Yangtze River area. The largest market is Hankou, with annual exports of over one million dan, worth approximately tens of millions of national currency. The United States accounts for approximately 70% of the total exports. Other countries such as Britain, Germany, France, the Netherlands, and Japan also import it. In recent years, the United States Department of Agriculture has been studying the planting of Tung trees carefully. Since 1913, trials have been conducted. As of 1933, the planting area occupied approximately 40,000 acres, with approximately 4 million Tung trees. China is the earliest country to produce Tung oil. If there is no organization to improve matters, it is feared that it will follow in the footsteps of silk and tea and fall behind. The statistics on China's Tung oil exports to various countries over the past two years are as follows:</p>
<p>Country	1932		1933</p>

<h3>Record of the General Meeting of Chinese Tobacco Industry</h3>
<p>Twenty-Four Companies Request Improvement of Tax Rate</p>
<p>Huang Ziping Talks About United Support for Small Factories</p>
<p>The Chinese Cigarette Industry Association held a supplementary meeting of its third membership meeting at the Central Western Restaurant on Sima Road at 3:00 PM yesterday. Representatives from the following factories attended: Li Xing Gengsheng, Da Dong Qiu Tanglin, Da Dong Sun Lishan, Hua Xing Hu Ruiting, Hua Min Shen Xingde, Da Zhonghua Chen Dejiao, Yazhou Peng Zizhen, Min Zhong Huang Ziping, Jinsha Zhou Tingzi, and 29 other factories, as well as more than ten attending members. Representatives from the Municipal Party Department He Yuanming, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Yuan Hongjun, the Tax Bureau Jiang Chengyi, and the Tax Bureau of the Jiangsu-Anhui District Chen Yan attended to provide guidance. Bao Gengsheng chaired the meeting, and Wu Peiyin recorded the minutes. The meeting began as scheduled. The chairman's report was omitted. Matters for discussion: (1) The case of the request from Min Zhong and 24 other companies to improve the tax rate: First, Huang Ziping, the representative of the Min Zhong Company, reported on the proposal. Next, the chairman stated that the previous resolution was to publicly elect Huang Ziping, Bao Gengsheng, Lao Jingxiu, Shen Xingde, Zhao Shao, Chen Maonan, Zhang Xinliang, Jing Yimeng, and Ding Boquan, nine people in total, to review the proposal and then submit it to the Executive Committee for processing. Resolution: Passed. (2) The Ministry of Finance agreed to allocate 300,000 foreign dollars to develop Chinese businesses and improve tobacco leaf. First, the chairman explained the resolution of the previous discussion meeting, stating that the funds would be kept by the industry association and should be acknowledged as such. Resolution: Passed. Next, nine people were publicly elected as custodians: Dai Gengxin, Ding Boquan, Huang Ziping, Lao Jingxiu, Bao Gengsheng, Zhao Yunshao, Zhang Xinliang, Jing Yimeng, and Shen Xingde were publicly elected as custodians. As for the use of the funds, it is limited to assisting in anti-smuggling, improving tobacco leaves, and constructing association facilities. Resolution: Passed. The meeting adjourned at approximately 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>A reporter from the Guowen News Agency met with Mr. Huang Ziping after the meeting. According to him, Chinese businesses have been greatly affected since the seven-level tax was changed to a three-level tax. There were originally 150 or 160 Chinese businesses under the seven-level tax, but after the tax was changed again to a two-level tax, factories closed down one after another, leaving only 40 or 50. If no measures are taken to remedy the situation urgently, then in a few years, Chinese cigarette factories will be completely forced to close down. Also, this tax change favors high-grade cigarettes. Before they were aware of this, large Chinese factories made no representation. Now, large factories such as Nanyang have expressed unanimous support for small factories, and Nanyang has also issued a separate declaration, which roughly states: "Upon investigation, the 24 cigarette factories, including Min Zhong, believe that the current cigarette tax rate heavily taxes low-grade cigarettes and lightly taxes high-grade cigarettes, resulting in unequal treatment. A case has been submitted to the government requesting improvement. The Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance has sent a letter to the Shanghai Cigarette Factory Industry Association for review. After discussions at the Association's meeting, it was resolved that members should express their opinions as much as possible. Since cigarettes flowed into China, money has flowed out by the tens of millions each year. Our industry has been operating diligently, only slightly plugging the leaks. Our government has spared no effort in protecting and promoting domestic industries in recent years. Although cigarettes are luxury goods, they are still an industry. Even if protective tariffs cannot be implemented, at least equal treatment should be given so that Chinese businesses can compete with foreign businesses. Our company is also a Chinese business, and fortunately, it has some high-grade cigarette production, which benefits somewhat. However, it is unbearable to sit and watch the decline of fellow businesses. Moreover, low taxes on high-grade cigarettes increase sales, while high taxes on low-grade cigarettes cause sales to stagnate. The tobacco leaves for low-grade cigarettes are all domestically produced, and if this leads to stagnation, then the livelihoods of farmers will be cut off. How can we bear to sit and watch the starvation of farmers in several provinces and ignore it? Our company has not been listed in the original proposal of Min Zhong and others, but we have sympathy. Our government is currently busy with military affairs and the agricultural sector is facing difficulties, and funds were hastily raised without considering this temporary unfair tax rate, which is not the original intention of our government to promote and protect industry. After our colleagues earnestly submit their appeal, we believe it will be accepted. As for the industry's suggestions for tax reform, the more levels, the more burdens, otherwise, taxation based on price is the fairest. It is said that the country is rich and the people are not exhausted, the tax is high but the rate is not harsh."</p>
<h3>Joint Meeting of Charities Resolves to Request Exemption from Property Land Tax</h3>
<p>Deadline for Filling Out and Reporting Forms Within Two Weeks</p>
<p>According to the Guomin News Agency, the Shanghai Federation of Charitable Organizations convened a joint meeting of representatives from various charitable organizations at its office on Yunnan Road at 4:00 PM yesterday. Representatives from over twenty organizations attended.</p>
<h3>Representatives Attending the Meeting</h3>
<p>Representatives attending the meeting included Wang Zhongfu of the Guangyi Benevolent Hall, Wang Zhongfu of the China Relief for Women and Children, Fei Jintang of the Wei Zhong Benevolent Hall, Weng Yinchu of the Lanyi Benevolent Association, Ye Shouhai of the Xin Puyu Hall, Chen Wenkui of the Shanghai Disabled Persons' Home, He Songshou of the Tongyi Benevolent Association, Sun Yishan of the Hunan Charitable Association, Liu Zuojun of the Shanghai Jixin Association, Wu Shutian of the Shanghai Charitable Group, Zhou Chuliang of the Public Shanghai Hospital, Gu Xizhou of the Gongji Hall, Gu Xizhou of the Fushan Hall, Wang Shenfu of the Horen Hall, Zhang Xianqing of the China Jisheng Association, Ni Rongtai of the Zhan Industry Public Righteousness Association, Luo Xingyou of the Zhabei Charitable Group, Zhang Junkang of the Shanghai Orphanage, Fang Zhijun of the Renji Benevolent Hall, Tai Yanqi of the Shanghai Charitable Group, Chen</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Shufeng of the Renji Nursery, Huang Hanzhi of the Xinwei Relief Association, and Wang Yiting, and other representatives from twenty-two organizations, totaling twenty-three people. Huang Hanzhi was publicly elected as chairman. The meeting began as scheduled.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>The chairman began by stating that the city is currently levying land value tax, starting with the areas of Hunan, Zhabei, and Pudong. The amount of the levy is often ten to dozens of times higher than the original levies. According to Article 2 of the Land Tax Levy Regulations, land used for public charitable purposes without income may be exempted from the temporary land value tax upon approval by the Municipal Government. Therefore, the office locations and charitable graveyards of various charitable organizations, which do not generate income, can apply for exemption. How to deal with the remaining income-generating land should be discussed in detail.</p>
<h3>Resolutions</h3>
<p>The income from land constitutes the majority of the funding for charitable organizations' charitable activities. In recent years, the market has declined, and rural areas have gone bankrupt. Income has already been sharply reduced, while the number of impoverished people has increased daily, making it necessary to find ways to provide relief, and expenses have actually increased. Adding a huge land tax would be an unbearable burden. All office locations and charitable graveyards of various charitable organizations without income should naturally apply for exemption in accordance with regulations. The remaining income-generating land should also be petitioned for reduction in order to maintain operations. The association will draft a form to notify various charitable organizations to list all land within the currently taxed areas, separating them into income-generating and non-income-generating categories, and report them to the association within two weeks so that they can be compiled and submitted for reduction or exemption. The meeting adjourned at approximately 7:00 PM.</p>
<h3>No Expansion of Taxed Business Districts for Land Value Tax Collection</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, since the land value tax was implemented in this city, although some landlords have repeatedly requested postponement or exemption, the municipal authorities believe that the situation in this city is different from that in the interior, and that the tax collection had already started in the concessions. The tax rate set this time in the Chinese-controlled area is also lower than that in the concessions, so it is not convenient to change it. Since its implementation, progress has been smooth. As for the rumor that the taxed business districts for the temporary land value tax collection will be expanded, according to sources from the Land Bureau, there is no such intention. Expanding business districts would require consideration of the market situation and submission to the central government for approval before it could be implemented. Therefore, the rumor is not accurate.</p>

<h3>No Panic Withdrawals at Guangdong Postal Savings</h3>
<p>Postal Savings Bureau Received Telegram</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that regarding rumors of panic withdrawals at the Guangzhou Post Office Savings Bank for several consecutive days, reporters visited the Postal Savings and Remittance General Bureau yesterday for inquiries. According to Xu Yuanfang, the director of the General Affairs Department of the bureau, the bureau had telegraphed the Guangzhou branch to inquire about this matter and had received a reply stating that there were no panic withdrawals. However, as it was approaching the end of the abolished lunar year, the general public, whose customs had not changed, were withdrawing more savings to meet their needs, hence the increase in the number of withdrawals at the bureau in recent days. Xu continued to say that the situation was generally the same everywhere every year, so the so-called panic withdrawals were not true.</p>
<h3>Additional Third and Fourth Class Shanghai-Wuxi Trains Added to Beijing-Shanghai Railway</h3>

<p>The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Traffic Department, in light of the abolished lunar new year and the fact that many people from various places in Shanghai were returning to their hometowns for the holidays, especially those from the middle and lower classes, which resulted in insufficient capacity on the existing third and fourth class trains, specially added one round-trip third and fourth class train between Shanghai and Wuxi starting from the 8th of this month.

<h3>Gu Xinyi and Bian Xiaoqing Petition the Ministry of Finance to Issue Flour and Wheat Purchase Price Deduction Vouchers</h3>
<p>If Calculated According to World Prices, Manufacturers Will Suffer Great Losses</p>
<p>Hoping That the Initial Intent to Benefit Merchants Will Be Quickly Adopted to Seek Relief Measures</p>
<p>Gu Xinyi, Chairman of the Shanghai Flour Mill Industry Association, and Bian Xiaoqing, Chairman of the Su, Zhe, and Anhui Inland Flour Mill Industry Association, recently noted that the Ministry of Finance's Cotton and Wheat Management Office is calculating the purchase price of flour and wheat for manufacturers according to world prices, which differ greatly from domestic market prices. They specially petitioned Kong Xiangxi, the Minister of Finance, requesting the Ministry of Finance to issue flour and wheat purchase price deduction vouchers to be deducted proportionally, in order to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. The original petition is recorded as follows: "Petitioning Regarding the Immediate Collection of the Announced Import Tax on Foreign Wheat, Causing Unexpected Losses for Manufacturers That Are Difficult to Bear. We Again Urgently Request Reimbursement According to the Amount, to Alleviate Merchants' Difficulties and Maintain Industry. We Humbly Submit That We Previously Petitioned to Request Exemption from Wheat Tax on the Foreign Wheat Import Tariffs Set by Various Manufacturers Before the Tax Announcement. We Were Grateful That Your Excellency Allowed Our Association's Various Factories to Purchase American Flour and Wheat Lent by the Government and, Within the Payment Due, to Deduct 5% of the Loss of Previously Paid Foreign Wheat Import Tariffs. We Reverently Acknowledge That Your Excellency Has Insightfully Recognized the Difficulties of Manufacturers and Provided Comprehensive Protection. All Members of the Industry Are Overwhelmed With Gratitude and Dare Not Raise Any Further Objections. However, the Process of Negotiating the Purchase of Flour and Wheat Has Resulted in Facts That Were Not Originally Envisioned or Expected by Your Excellency, and We Must Once Again Express Our Sentiments to the Minister. Manufacturers Followed the Minister's Order, Dispatching Representatives to Confer With the Cotton and Wheat Management Office Regarding the Terms of Purchase of Flour and Wheat. Over the Course of Several Weeks, the Main Condition, the Price, Proved Impossible for Manufacturers to Accept. The Cotton and Wheat Management Office Instructed Manufacturers to Purchase at World Prices, Which Differ Greatly From Domestic Market Prices. If Manufacturers Purchased Flour and Wheat at World Prices, Not Only Would They Be Unable to Offset the Loss of Previously Paid Tariffs, but They Would Also Be Burdened With Losses Several Times Greater Than the Tariffs. The Cotton and Wheat Management Office Is Unable to Uphold Your Excellency's Generous Intention to Protect Manufacturers. Therefore, the Terms of Purchase of Flour and Wheat Were Ultimately Difficult to Sign. Manufacturers Have Already Paid the Foreign Wheat Import Tariffs and Can Only Continue to Beseech Your Excellency to Maintain the Original Intention of Benefiting Merchants in Difficulty and Rescuing Industry, To Approve, Under the Name of Encouragement or Relief, the Issuance of Flour and Wheat Purchase Price Deduction Vouchers According to the Amount of the Previously Paid Wheat Tax by Each Factory, Which Should Be Handed Over to Those Factories, Allowing Them to Proportionally Deduct From the Payments Due For the Repurchase of Government-Lent Flour and Wheat. This Method Benefits Both Sides, Upholding the Credibility of Your Ministry's Order From Above and Preventing the Crumbling Flour Industry From Going Bankrupt. Your Excellency's Intention to Benefit Merchants in Difficulty and Rescue Industry Would Also Be Further Highlighted. If Approved, Not Only Would Our Association's Various Factories Feel the Grateful Protection, But the Livelihoods of Tens of Thousands of Workers and the Revenue of National Taxes and Unified Taxes Could Also Be Spared. We Urgently Express Our Sentiments and Humbly Await Your Orders. Respectfully Submitted."</p>
<h3>Gu Xinyi Telegraphs to Guangdong Authorities Requesting the Cancellation of Special Tax on Domestic Oil Beans</h3>
<p>Imposing Taxes on Imported Agricultural Products Was Originally Intended to Protect Farmers and Merchants</p>
<p>Now Taxing Domestic Products Will Only Accelerate the Collapse of Agriculture</p>
<p>Gu Xinyi, Chairman of the Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain and Oilcake Trade Association, yesterday telegraphed the Executive Committee of the Southwest Political Conference of Guangzhou, the Guangdong Provincial Government, the Provincial and Municipal Party Committees, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating: (Omissions) According to industry reports, the Guangdong Province has established a special tax bureau for imported agricultural products, levying special taxes on imported agricultural products. However, recently, domestically produced peanuts, soybeans, and crude oil transported to Guangdong have been detained by the bureau. In recent years, farmers and merchants have been in dire straits, reaching their limit. The establishment of a bureau to levy special taxes on imported goods was originally intended to protect farmers and merchants, and the bureau should focus on taxing foreign goods to avoid contradicting the original purpose. Now, taxing domestic products will only accelerate the collapse of farmers and merchants. Furthermore, the Guangdong Provincial Department of Finance has announced that wheat bran is subject to surcharges, and peanuts, soybeans, and crude oil, which are related to people's food, are even more important, so taxing them together with imported products is not a fair practice. We humbly request that this special tax be immediately abolished. The telegram is urgently dispatched. Gu Xinyi, Chairman of the Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain and Oilcake Trade Association.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Social Bureau Provides Relief to Disaster Areas</h3>
<p>Appealing for Sponsorship From Philanthropists</p>
<p>The Shanghai Social Bureau has always paid close attention to handling charitable affairs. Since the January 28th Incident two years ago, the disaster-stricken areas of the city have covered an area of more than 140 hectares, with a population of more than 600,000. The bureau has raised funds to organize various loan relief and other relief activities, benefiting the people greatly and achieving significant results. However, due to the large size of the disaster area and the large number of disaster victims, the previously raised funds were still insufficient for application. The bureau has continued to organize relief efforts in the war zone. In addition to government allocations, it plans to raise donations from Chinese and foreign philanthropists in order to ensure that relief efforts are widespread. A reporter from the Central News Agency specially inquired about this matter with Wu Huanru, the section chief of the Second Section of the Shanghai Social Bureau. According to Wu, in recent times, the city has not yet recovered from the old wounds of the January 28th Incident, farmers have suffered from natural disasters last year, and the commercial environment is extremely desolate. The people's suffering is difficult to describe in words. Several groups come to the bureau every day to request relief. The bureau's responsibility lies in trying its best to find ways to provide relief. Although the bureau currently has 20,000 to 30,000 yuan in cash donated by various sectors, it is merely a drop in the bucket. In order to ensure widespread relief, it is planned to appeal to Chinese and foreign philanthropists to remember the suffering of the disaster victims and generously donate. However, in order to avoid the emergence of malpractices, the bureau is only soliciting donations through newspaper advertisements. Anyone willing to donate should send the donations to the Shanghai Municipal Bank and notify the bureau. Once a certain amount has been collected, the bureau will start organizing various relief activities. As for the methods of organizing, they will be determined based on the future fundraising situation.</p>

<h3>Qingdao Municipal Government Forms Special Investigation Group to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Investigating National Municipal Administration</p>
<p>Focusing on Port Affairs and Railways</p>
<p>Mr. Shen Honglie, the Mayor of Qingdao, in order to organize municipal administration and develop port affairs, has specially formed a municipal investigation group to go to major ports, special municipalities, and port coasts across the country for on-site investigation. As Qingdao Port and Jiaoji Railway have a connected relationship, the Jiaoji Railway also temporarily sent representatives to join. When the members of each group were about to depart, the Longhai Railway received the news and also requested to join members to inspect various places together. The group first went to Hong Kong and Guangdong, then to Shanghai, and has been conducting inspections in Shanghai for several days, extremely busy. Our reporter specially visited the residences of the members yesterday and received detailed information. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Motivation for Organization</h3>
<p>Qingdao's municipal administration has been progressing rapidly in recent years. The number of people from all over the country who come to Qingdao to escape the summer heat and travel is increasing day by day. Since the opening of the Shanghai-Qingdao special liner service by China Merchants Sanbei and other national steamships, port affairs have also become increasingly developed. Even land prices and construction projects have risen. In order to promote the development of joint transportation on various lines, a municipal investigation group was specially organized, and commissioners were assigned to various places in the city to conduct on-site inspections of various port cities across the country as a reference for reform. The types of investigations conducted by the group members are municipal administration, customs, port affairs, and railways.</p>
<h3>Number of Members</h3>
<p>The investigation group formed by the Qingdao Municipal Government is led by Wang Xichang, Deputy Director of the Port Affairs Bureau of the city, as well as Tai Guisen, Technician of the Port Affairs Bureau, and Gao Zhishu, Technician of the Public Works Bureau. Those joining from the Jiaoji Railway are Yi Shuigui, Deputy Director of the Vehicle Affairs Department, and Meng Xiuwei, Technician of the railway. Qin Yulin, Technician of the Longhai Railway, temporarily requested to join. There are a total of six members. All expenses required by the group are borne by the Qingdao Municipal Government. They departed from Qingdao on January 15th.</p>
<h3>First to Hong Kong and Guangdong</h3>
<p>This time, the Qingdao Municipal Government's investigation group must visit all major ports and cities across the country. It was decided to first go to South China, then to Central China, and finally to North China. Therefore, on January 15th, they took a steamer from Qingdao to Shanghai. At that time, they were eager to go to Hong Kong, so they transferred to the Empress of Japan steamer on the 17th and arrived in Hong Kong on the 20th. The members of each group explained the purpose of the investigation to the Governor of Hong Kong and requested to visit the various port affairs agencies and railway conditions. They were warmly welcomed by the Governor in Hong Kong. They toured for four days and obtained a lot of reference materials on municipal administration.</p>
<h3>Returning to Shanghai from Guangdong</h3>
<p>On the 24th of last month, they transferred from Hong Kong to Guangzhou to contact the Guangzhou Municipal Government, and were warmly welcomed by Mayor Liu Jiwen. They stayed in Guangzhou for a total of five days. They thoroughly investigated the new construction, port affairs, railways, warehouses, and wharf facilities in Guangzhou, and consulted the regulations for all content management and other methods. At the end of the month, they returned to Hong Kong and took the Changxing Russian Queen steamer to Shanghai, arriving in Shanghai on the 2nd of this month.</p>
<h3>Investigating Shanghai</h3>
<p>Shanghai is a special city and a place where Chinese and foreign people gather. The shipping industry is the most developed, ranking first in the country's port affairs, so it is particularly valued by the group. Starting on the 3rd, all the members of the group requested to visit Mayor Wu to observe the municipal administration and investigate the various agencies under the municipal government, conducting classified and detailed investigations for six days. It was only completed yesterday. After the municipal administration examination, they also inspected the Beijing-Shanghai Railway to obtain information for the reform of the Jiaoji Railway.</p>
<h3>Departing for Qingdao This Morning</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter met with Mr. Xiong, Mr. Qin, and others and asked about the results of the investigation. Mr. Xiong, as a port affairs expert, said that the port affairs conditions in Hong Kong, Guangdong, and Shanghai are different, and each has its own characteristics. There are many resources available to the Qingdao Municipal Government. This trip has yielded a wealth of information, which will be reported and announced after it is sorted out in the future. However, the inspection tour of this group is not yet halfway through. Central China and North China also need to be investigated. Only because it is currently the end of the lunar year, it is inevitable that customs will be followed everywhere. Therefore, we have decided to return to Qingdao first and wait until after this Spring Festival holiday before going to Yantai, Tianjin, and other places. Each member of the group will leave Shanghai for Qingdao on the Dalian Maru steamer at 9:00 this morning.</p>

<h3>The Huge Fraud Case of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China Concluded Yesterday</h3>
<p>Sentencing Scheduled for the Morning of the 12th</p>
<p>French Police Continue to Arrest a Legal Person</p>
<p>The criminals arrested in the case of the huge fraud against the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, six people of Chinese and Russian nationality, have been prosecuted by the police to the First Special District Court. The various situations of the trial have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Qian ordered the six defendants to be brought to court again, and the two Japanese who made the copper plate and printed the counterfeit checks were summoned again to prove that the copper plate was indeed manufactured and printed by Sarnick. At this point in the trial, after all the witnesses in the case had been examined, he ordered the debate to begin. First, the police lawyers Ru Baoyi and Li Zhishan rose to argue, elaborating on the crimes of the defendants and analyzing in detail the division of labor and cooperation of the defendants in forging false checks and defrauding huge sums of money, requesting that they be convicted and sentenced according to the charged articles of law. Then, lawyer Fes rose to defend the defendants Jiaosai Fuaier Ahni and his adopted son Ximarasikai, saying that the main person in the case was actually the Englishman Mark, and the first defendant only played a helping role, while the third defendant only obeyed the orders of the first defendant, and should not be held responsible for the crime. Lawyer Mao Xianshen then rose to defend the third defendant Wang Chungan, saying that although Wang took the old checks of the Chartered Bank and handed them over to the first defendant, he did not know their purpose at first. After that, he was divided into stolen foreign goods, even if he had clearly understood, he was only responsible for receiving stolen goods, etc., and defended to the court. The fourth defendant Xie Pingfeng was defended by three lawyers, Zhang Chongding, Fan Gang, and Wang Jian. Fan and Wang based their arguments on the facts of the case, saying that Xie was entrusted by the first defendant to print checks at the Lianyi Printing House and did not know that they were used for defrauding money, and requested that Xie be declared innocent. Lawyer Zhang then expressed his views on legal points, saying that Xie introduced the printing of checks, but he did not know the purpose of the checks, so he was unaware of the fraud. Since he was unaware, it was not intentional, and there was no intention to defraud. As for the money given to Xie by the first defendant afterwards, even if Xie had expected the source of the money at this time, it was only known afterwards and was equivalent to receiving stolen goods. Then, lawyer Lin Yingqing defended the fifth defendant Sarnick, and lawyer Fan rose again to defend the sixth defendant Yang Cailin. The reasons he held were similar to those for defending Xie Pingfeng. Finally, lawyer Li Zhishan slightly refuted the words of the various defenders. Judge Qian then made a final inquiry to the defendants and then announced the end of the debate, scheduling a public sentencing for the morning of the 12th. Except for Ximarasikai, who had been allowed bail, the other five defendants were still taken back to the police station for custody. It is also known that a Portuguese employee of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, who participated in defrauding the money, has been arrested by the Portuguese consul in Shanghai. It is now scheduled to be tried in the Portuguese Consulate on the 12th. The Portuguese consul has already sent a letter to the police station yesterday, requesting that all those who should testify in the case be ordered to be present at the time to be questioned.</p>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News reported that Mr. Mark, the Englishman who is the manager of Pu Xi Foreign Company, is one of the defendants in the case of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China being defrauded of more than 130,000 yuan. This morning (9th), he was tried by the British Consular Police Court. Mr. Sykes, an accountant of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, Mr. White, an accountant of the British American Tobacco Company, and a certain Mr. Zhu from the deposit department of the Guohua Bank all testified in court one after another. Mr. White claimed that the money was not paid to any commercial firm, and the signature on the check was not in the handwriting of himself or Mr. Peacock. The defendant Mr. Mark strongly argued that he had nothing to do with the case. This case is expected to not be able to be decided for a while.</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that the French Concession Police arrested a legal person born in Russia yesterday (8th), which is related to the case of the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China being defrauded of a huge sum of money. He will be escorted to the French Consular Police Court for trial this morning. It is said that this person once served in the French Commercial Counsellor's Office for three or four months.</p>
<h3>The Mail Clerk Was Too Absurd, Concealing More Than a Thousand Letters Without Sending Them</h3>
<p>Tearing off the Stamps on the Letters and Converting Them into Cash</p>
<p>American Dollar Notes Worth Seven Yuan Were Also Found on His Person</p>
<p>The Laozha Police Station received a phone report from a Westerner from the Meifeng Bank on Nanjing Road, No. 29, at about 9:00 a.m. the day before yesterday, stating that most of the important letters and documents issued by the bank from July last year to the present have not been received, and there may be other circumstances involved. Please investigate in detail. The chief immediately ordered Western Detective Ding Tuo and Chinese Detective Li Yidong to go to the Meifeng Bank for on-site investigation. After a long time, they discovered that Zhang Shousan, a native of Baoshan and a mail clerk of the company, was suspected of being seriously involved. He was arrested and taken to the police station for a search. Evidence of a kind was found on Zhang's person, namely American dollar bills worth seven yuan, one for five yuan and two for one yuan, which were sealed in a letter by Miss Roman, a Western woman from the Meifeng Bank, on August 9 last year and instructed to be sent to the United States. After the Chinese and Western detectives obtained the clues, they took Zhang to his residence at No. 3, Lane 599, Zhejiang Road, and found more than 1,016 letters from the Meifeng Bank to various countries, as well as two bundles of paper, two sets of calendars, a photo album, and five paper bags, all of which were secretly stolen by Zhang and brought home. Moreover, there was a letter with a check attached, which was taken back to the police station for custody. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Court's Criminal Court No. 1. Lawyer Li Zhishan of the police station rose to describe the course of the case in detail, saying that the circumstances of this case are serious, and the police believe that there is still a need for detailed investigation, so Zhang Shousan has not been formally prosecuted, and requested that he be detained and the date of the trial be changed. When questioned, Zhang Shousan confessed that he went to the Meifeng Bank as a mail clerk in February last year, and his monthly salary was initially only 15 yuan, but it has now increased to 25 yuan. However, two yuan must be deducted for savings every month, which is really not enough to cover expenses. He was forced by economic circumstances to take this measure. He also admitted that he did have more than a thousand letters that he withheld and did not send, and tore off the stamps to convert them into cash, totaling more than 200 yuan before and after. This matter started in July last year and lasted until October, only three months. As for the American dollar bills worth seven yuan that were taken from his person, because Miss Roman did not seal the mouth of the letter tightly and the corner of the bill was exposed on the outside, he thought it was a fun thing, so he took it down, etc. After Feng Shide, the presiding judge, verified the confession, he instructed that Zhang be allowed to be detained and wait for the trial to be changed to the 21st.</p>

<h3>Extorting 2,500 Gold Coins Sent to the Second Special District Citizens' Association</h3>
<p>Zhou Chunxiu and Li Jiatai Arrested at the Same Time</p>
<p>Fan Rencai Became Enemies with Others Due to Official Duties</p>
<p>There was a huge swindler named Liang Kexi who falsely established the Hexing Trading Company on Yuanmingyuan Road last winter and opened current accounts with various foreign banks in this name. Before long, all the banks he had dealings with were overdrawn, totaling about 160,000 gold coins. The Meifeng Bank on Nanjing Road was also one of the defrauded parties. However, Fan Rencai, an employee of the bank, discovered it early, so only 5,000 gold coins were overdrawn at that time. Fan immediately demanded the money from Liang, and Liang was also afraid that the incident would become uncontrollable, so he repaid the debt owed to Meifeng and then fled with the money. When other banks reported to the police, Liang had already disappeared without a trace, and his whereabouts have not been detected until now. Therefore, this fraud case is currently at a standstill. Since Fan discovered that Liang was a swindler and recovered the debt, Meifeng suffered no loss. It was indeed fortunate. However, Fan had made enemies with others. At the end of last month, Fan suddenly received a threatening letter accusing Fan of colluding with Liang to carry out the fraud and demanding that Fan quickly hand over half of the 5,000 gold coins he had obtained from Liang, otherwise the fraud and inside stories would be exposed in the newspapers. He was asked to post a notice in the newspaper immediately. Fan told the bank's manager and reported it to the General Police Station for investigation. He also posted an advertisement in the Times on February 2, 3, and 4 as instructed in the letter, signed (Tian Tian). On the 7th, Fan received a phone call saying that they had sent a second letter and could handle it according to the instructions in the letter. At this time, Fan had not yet received the so-called second letter. He still reported to the General Police Station and sent Detective Gao Zhen to the post office with the Mail Inspection Office of the Municipal Public Security Bureau to check the letters. Soon, the letter was found, and after opening it, it instructed Fan to place the money in a shoebox at 4:00 p.m. on the 8th and send it to the second floor of the Second Special District Citizens' Association at No. 112, Yideli Road, Weier Meng Road in the French Concession. He only needed to leave the box and not say much. Detective Gao then made a package according to the instructions, filled the box with waste paper instead of banknotes, carried it to the place, and saw Zhou Chunxiu and Li Jiatai, two cadres of the association, sitting in the meeting. When Zhou saw Detective Gao, a look of panic suddenly appeared on his face, and he wanted to get up and receive the box. Gao immediately questioned him, and Zhou became impatient and reluctantly took the box and threw it on the table, and deliberately said to Li that he did not know who sent the box. Detective Gao felt that these two people were very suspicious, so he re-entered the room with the detectives sent by the French police, and saw that the rope on the box had been untied, the lid of the box had been opened, and the paper stacked in the box was also messy. He arrested the two people and took the box back to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special District Court and tried by Judge Feng Shide. First, lawyer Li Zhishan of the police station described the course of the case, saying that the case still needs to be investigated and requested a change of date. Zhou and Li also hired lawyers such as Jie Gang to defend them. Judge Feng approved the detention and changed the date for another trial.</p>
<h3>Collision of Rice Boats and Sugar Boats</h3>
<p>The Bow Was Broken and the Escort Drowned</p>
<p>Who Will Compensate for the Losses of Each Party?</p>
<p>Qin Decheng, a rice boat from Jiangsu, was recently hired by the Shanghai rice merchant Heji Company to load 190 shi of white rice to transport to Shanghai. Because the end of the lunar year was approaching, he was eager to transport the rice to Shanghai. He instructed Qin's boat to set sail so that it could arrive in Shanghai as soon as possible. A apprentice, Jin Jinsheng, was also sent to escort the boat. The boat set sail for Shanghai after loading the goods the day before yesterday. When it reached the north entrance of the Mahe River in Southern Huangpu, it happened to have a tailwind, so it hoisted its sails and sailed very fast. Shen Chunlin's boat, loaded with seafood, sugar, and northern goods from a certain company in Jiaxing, was sailing south. The two boats were sailing close to each other head-on at that place. They were each turning their rudders to avoid each other, but Qin's boat was faster due to the tailwind. It was too late to avoid each other, and the two boats collided violently. The bow of Qin's boat was broken, and the escort, Jin Jinsheng, was knocked into the water. Although Shen's boat was larger, it was very old, and the bow was broken off. Water immediately poured in, and it gradually sank. Both boats called for help. Fortunately, a Huzhou steamer happened to pass by and saw them and went forward to rescue Jin Jinsheng, who had fallen into the water. He was not found. The sinking boat was rescued first and taken to the beach to be stranded. Then, Qin's boat was towed to a shallow beach and stopped. However, after the collision, both boats had cracks in their hulls, and the goods inside were wet. Qin reported to the cargo owner yesterday because Jin Jinsheng was missing, requesting negotiations. Both sides had their own reasons and refused to be held responsible for compensation. However, rice and sugar are both items that cannot be soaked in water, and now they have been damaged, resulting in a great loss. The Heji hired a boat to transfer the rice from Qin's boat to Shanghai and entrusted someone to pay attention to finding the body.</p>

<h3>Chen Lifu Talks About Chinese Movies</h3>
<p>At Present, We Need to Focus on Nationalism</p>
<p>We Must Recognize the Content of Production and Education Films</p>
<p>A Reporter from the Nanjing Central News Agency Visited Central Committee Member Chen Lifu for Business, and He Mentioned the Issue of Chinese Movies in the Middle of the Conversation. His Words Were Profound and Hit the Current Malpractice. They Are Recorded as Follows. Mr. Chen Said, "The Chinese Film Industry Has Made Extremely Rapid Progress Compared to Previous Years, and the Audience Welcomes Domestically Produced Films Extremely Warmly. This is Really a Good Phenomenon for the Future of the Domestically Produced Film Industry. However, Some Businessmen Engaged in the Film Industry Still Cannot Recognize the Path That Domestically Produced Films Should Take, and Neglect the Requirements of the Times and National Character, and the Significance of Film Education, Which Affects the Credit and Authority of the Domestically Produced Film Industry to No Small Extent. This is Really a Pity. It is Even More Heartbreaking to Pick Up My Previous Words and Conversations About the Issue of Movies, Forcefully and Arbitrarily Interpret Them, and Use Them as a Cover for Proletarian-Consciousness Movies. You Must Know That Proletarian-Consciousness Films Can Never Be Used to Confuse the Issues of National Independence and People's Livelihood Development. Movies That Promote the National Spirit Must Stand on the Position of Fighting for the Survival of the Entire Nation and Create an Immortal Cause. They Are Definitely Not Proletarian Works Aimed at Inciting the Differentiation of All Classes Within the Entire Nation, and They Cannot Be Falsely Borrowed to Replace Them. (Force) is the Main Element to Promote National Unity and All Construction Progress, and It Is Also the Main Expression of National Unity, But It Can Never Be Achieved by the Way of Riots That Harm the Country and the Nation. The Movie Art That the Current National Revolution Urgently Needs Is Based on Nationalism, Aiming at Promoting the Culture and Spirit of the Entire Nation as Its Main Purpose and Task. It Can Never Be Confused and Arbitrarily Interpreted by Proletarian Films That Incite Class Opposition, Provoke the Struggle Between the Rich and the Poor, Betray the Interests of the National State, and Perform Riots in a Riotous Way. As for Production and Education Films, We Must Especially Recognize the Content of Production and Education. We Must Never Mix Fish Eyes with Pearls and Falsely Associate Proletarian-Consciousness Works with Production and Education Films. I Sincerely Hope That My Colleagues in the Chinese Film Industry Will Pay Attention to This Point."</p>

<h3>Nanjing Road Citizens' Association Requests Court to Swiftly Impose the Death Penalty on Zhou Zhanyuan</h3>
<p>|To Avenge the Wrongful Death of Li Minzhou|</p>
<p>The Nanjing Road Business Association and the First District Citizens' Association sent a letter to the Special District Court yesterday, stating: (Respectfully submitted, concerning the brutal murder of Mr. Li Minzhou, Executive Committee member of our Association, on February 1 by Si Ge Bu's executioner, which is related to law and order and hinders public safety. It is requested that the death penalty be imposed to rectify people's hearts and restrain violent winds. New-Sun Company's former manager was a kind and gentle person who treated his subordinates with leniency. However, the patrol deputy head Zhou Zhanyuan, who had been dismissed for receiving three demerits and repeatedly failing to heed warnings, was brutally murdered by Zhou. The stubborn wickedness is extreme and the crime is unforgivable. Although the criminal was caught on the same night, the police have filed a public prosecution for premeditated murder. However, it is heard that the criminal is stubbornly arguing and attempting to escape punishment. In fact, Zhou Zhanyuan's shooting of Li Minzhou is clear and obvious. Newspapers have published detailed accounts, so there is no need for debate. Moreover, Zhou Zhanyuan, as a public official, has the duty to protect citizens. In other words, Li Minzhou was also among those whom the criminal should have protected. Now, knowing the law and violating it, colleagues believe that they are as vulnerable as teeth when the lips are gone. We should request an increased sentence and swift execution to warn the stubborn and rectify people's hearts. Your honor, with your high-hanging mirror, you should be able to judge the case fairly and redress the injustice. We sincerely hope that you will not be blinded by Zhou Zhanyuan's strong arguments. With great respect.)</p>

<h3>The Use of Dictionaries</h3>
<p>A learned person is not necessarily someone who can (remember) many technical terms and specialized vocabulary and (understand) their meanings. Primarily, it is someone who can (find) their origins and their meanings. This is because reading is not just about memorization; understanding is key. Moreover, simply memorizing numerous terms and jargon, no matter how much or how broadly one remembers them, is actually of little use. Any rudimentary dictionary is far superior. Human memory is ultimately limited. However, encountering these terms while reading and not understanding them is not only regrettable but also greatly hinders comprehension. Therefore, (memorizing) the meanings of terms is not entirely necessary (though knowing important terms and their meanings is necessary), but (being able to look them up) is essential.</p>
<p>The only way to understand (technical terms) is to consult dictionaries. In recent years, China's cultural endeavors, while still far behind Western standards, have indeed made considerable progress compared to previous years. Considering only dictionaries, many types have been published in recent years. Although few are meticulously edited, having a bad dictionary is better than having none. Finding nothing in dictionaries, as mentioned in your letter, does not mean (using dictionaries) is wrong. Besides consulting dictionaries, what better method is there? While you may lack teachers and friends, even with many knowledgeable friends, you know that (one or two teachers and friends) cannot completely answer everything. But why does your difficulty arise? Most likely, the dictionary you are using is not comprehensive enough. For example, the "Ciyuan" dictionary covers a wide range of categories, but its volumes are limited. How could it possibly include all past and present terms? It can only include the important ones, and it emphasizes (classical) terms, with fewer modern terms included. However, the purpose of a dictionary is to allow us to find whatever we want at any time. Therefore, our standard for choosing a dictionary is not how many categories it includes but whether it comprehensively covers the terms within the categories it does include. The number of categories is a secondary issue. Therefore, you should purchase dictionaries for the subjects you are studying, and avoid buying too many general dictionaries.</p>
<p>If you enjoy reading novels and literature, there are dictionaries for this area such as "Literary Dictionary," "New Literature Dictionary," and "New Literature Description Dictionary," etc. For studying economics, there is the "Economics Dictionary" (edited by Ke Xiangnian). However, based on your letter, it seems that you are not struggling with terms when researching a specific subject but rather encountering many terms that you don't understand while reading casually. Therefore, you still seem to need a dictionary that covers a wide range of categories and includes commonly used words. In this case, the "Modern Language Dictionary" (edited by Li Dingsheng) and the "New Terminology Dictionary" (edited by Ke Bonian, et al.) would be quite helpful. These two books are quite comprehensive and the writing is clear. However, many explanations lack precision, so they should only be used for reference. It is absolutely not advisable to treat their explanations as definitions.</p>
<p>If you encounter terms that you cannot find explanations for anywhere, you can send a letter to this newspaper, and we will do our best to find their origins and explanations for you. – Yi Kang</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Actively Provides Relief for Education of Youths from the Northeast</h3>

<p>Jiangsu Education Department Order, Starting in the 23rd Year</p>
<h3>Ordinary Middle Schools Must Not Expand</h3>
<p>Vocational Schools Should Be Expanded</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education issued an order to the education bureaus of various counties stating: "It has been repeatedly ordered by the Ministry of Education since the 20th year to restrict the establishment of ordinary middle schools and actively increase the establishment of vocational schools. Although this department has repeatedly ordered county-run middle schools in various counties to adhere to the single-track system in principle and not arbitrarily expand classes, and has persuaded privately established middle schools to convert to vocational schools, vocational education has still not been fully promoted. Last year, the Ministry of Education issued the 'Standards for the Establishment and Allocation of Funds for Secondary Schools in Various Provinces and Cities,' stipulating that (1) the allocation of secondary education funds in each province and city for vocational schools must not be less than 35 percent (including vocational supplementary schools), normal schools must account for approximately 25 percent, and middle schools must account for approximately 40 percent, limited to achieving the above standards from the 23rd year to the 26th year; (2) the newly added funds for secondary education in each province and city should be used primarily for vocational and normal school funds. Those unable to increase funds should gradually reduce the corresponding amount of middle school funds from the existing funds to expand vocational education and normal school education; (3) the above standards and deadlines are equally applicable to county-run middle schools throughout the province, and each department should plan, supervise, and handle them throughout the province; (4) each department should supervise and urge privately established middle schools to convert to vocational schools or vocational supplementary schools in order to achieve a state of balanced development between private middle schools and private vocational schools by the 26th year of the Republic of China, which is currently under review. The provincial government ordered (starting from the 23rd year, ordinary middle school classes in this province should be restricted and not arbitrarily expanded for enrollment, and strict admission should be enforced, with the total number not exceeding the number of the previous year), which should be followed and circulated for compliance. According to this order, the allocation of funds for secondary schools in various counties shows that ordinary middle schools account for the most, and vocational schools are often non-existent. As a result, ordinary middle schools are expanding daily, and vocational schools are rarely developing. Such a distorted state is difficult to improve the efficiency of secondary education as a whole. The 23rd year is approaching in an instant. The measures for secondary schools in various counties, except for normal schools, which will be separately ordered, are now stipulated as follows: (1) County-run middle schools that originally operated on a single track must not expand classes on the pretext of a large number of students going on to higher education. Those that originally operated on a double track should gradually reduce enrollment starting from the 23rd year and convert to a single track by the 26th year. The admission of students should be strictly enforced. (2) Counties that have already established vocational schools should find ways to expand them. Those that have not established them should immediately plan to establish them. The funds should be offset by the reduced middle school funds or newly added funds. If funds are limited, vocational supplementary schools should also be planned to train students who cannot go on to higher education with practical skills. (3) Privately established middle schools that have been registered should be supervised and urged to reduce ordinary classes and gradually convert to vocational schools in areas where the establishment of ordinary middle schools is more dense. (4) Starting from the 23rd year, privately established middle schools should be immediately supervised and urged to convert to vocational schools or vocational supplementary schools. If the funds are not very generous, they should be persuaded to convert to primary schools to show restriction. The above clauses regarding county-run secondary schools should be drafted in detail by the principal of the school, and the funds should be included in the 23rd year education budget of the county and reported for approval. Regarding privately established middle schools, they should be supervised and complied with and reported. In addition to separate circulation, this order is hereby issued to the director of the bureau for compliance and circulation to all public and private middle schools under their jurisdiction for compliance, which is hereby ordered."</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Education Department Orders Strict Examination of the Conduct of Third-Year Middle School Students</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education issued an order to the education bureaus of various counties, stating: "Middle school students are the backbone of society, and normal school students are the teachers of primary schools. They should strive diligently in their studies and cultivate their character to fulfill this mission. However, the higher the grade level of these students, the less emphasis they place on their studies, the less they abide by order, and the less attention they pay to their conduct. The Director of this Department has observed, as well as according to the reports of various supervisors, that third-year students in various schools often arbitrarily skip classes, their assignments are becoming increasingly lax, they are absent from memorial weeks without reason, they often do not attend morning exercises, and they arbitrarily disrupt order in self-study rooms, dormitories, and dining halls. This is just to mention the most obvious cases, which has led other grades to follow suit, and the academic atmosphere is becoming increasingly arrogant. If the above situations or other violations of school rules occur in the future, the principals of the schools should be held responsible and strictly dealt with, and should not be tolerated. The students should also learn from their mistakes and not neglect the regulations just because graduation is near, thus undoing all their previous efforts. The principals of each school should strictly examine the students' usual conduct and report it at any time. This year's graduation examination for middle school students and the graduation procedures for normal and vocational schools will be determined by this Department with reference to each student's usual conduct, in order to reverse the declining trend. In addition to separate circulation, this order is hereby issued to the director of the bureau for circulation to all public and private middle schools under their jurisdiction for general knowledge and announcement, which is hereby ordered."</p>
<h3>China-British Boxer Indemnity Refund Committee Announces Examinations for Government-Funded Students Studying in England</h3>

<h3>Summary of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Education Budget</h3>
<p>The Education Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council has drafted the education budget for 1934 and submitted it to the Board of Directors on Wednesday of this week. After approval by the Board of Directors, it was sent to the Finance Committee for review and compilation. As usual, the temporary expenses are divided into categories A, B, and C. Category A refers to projects that the Board of Directors has already approved or deems urgent. Category B refers to projects that are considered necessary and will be carried out as soon as funds are available. Category C refers to projects that will not be paid for this year due to financial and other reasons.</p>
<p>The temporary expenses for Chinese schools include 25,000 yuan for the installation of heating pipes and boiler rooms at Nie Zhongcheng Public School, marked as Category A; 2,000 yuan for increasing the height of the wall at Chinese Public School, marked as Category A; 280,000 yuan for the new building of Girls' Middle School (already under construction), marked as Category A; and the cost of using the Council's military shed to build a playground at Huishan Road Primary School, also marked as Category A, with the exact amount to be supplemented by the Finance Department. In addition, 11,600 yuan is needed to convert two classrooms and make other modifications to the Kenningham Road Primary School. The Public Works Department believes that this temporary addition is uneconomical and is marked as Category C. Regarding this issue, the Education Committee plans to set a limit on the number of students admitted to each primary school in the future. 10,000 yuan is needed for the addition of a playground and handicraft room at Xinzha Road Primary School. This is considered deferrable, or the military shed could be converted in the future, so it is marked as Category C. 17,000 yuan is needed for the reconstruction of a larger playground at Chinese Public School. It is generally agreed that this can be deferred for one year and is marked as Category C. The temporary expenses for Western schools include 15,000 yuan for the final payment for the construction of Yu Garden Road Western Public School, marked as Category A; 400,000 yuan for the construction of the Hamilton House Western Girls' Public School, marked as Category A; 25,000 yuan for adding and modifying the cooking center at Yu Garden Road Western Girls' Public School, and 6,000 yuan for the playground. Since the old ones have been demolished, there is a need to rebuild them, so they are marked as Category B. As for the regular expenses, after slightly revising and adding comments on the expenses for the Education Department and the six Western schools, they were submitted to the Finance Committee for review.</p>

<p>The Shanghai-Hong Kong-Tianjin interport football match, Shanghai vs. Hong Kong, or Shanghai vs. Tianjin, is held at least once a year.

The three teams will gather again in Shanghai during the Lunar New Year to compete for the championship trophy. The Hong Kong team has already boarded the British mail ship "Kinmaulin" yesterday and is heading north, and is expected to arrive here on the 12th. The Tianjin team will take the train south this morning, and will also arrive in Shanghai in the next few days.

<h3>Analysis of Triangular Strength</h3>
<p>Shanghai: The strength of the Shanghai interport team has unexpectedly changed greatly in the recent week. The Donghua Association was dissatisfied with the Western United Association's arrangements. Five players selected, including Dai Linjing and Zhou Xianyan, refused to play in the two interport trial matches, resulting in all of them being dropped. Only three Chinese players, including Sun Jinshun, were selected. The strength of the Shanghai team was greatly affected. The current forced lineup, apart from the satisfactory midfield and the relatively reliable defense, is questionable whether goalkeeper Fulushou can play after his injury. Even if he does play, he is only a second-rate player. There are not many talented forwards for shooting. It is very difficult for Shanghai to use Hua Te on the left wing. Compared with Tianjin and Hong Kong, it seems to be inferior.</p>
<p>Hong Kong: Hong Kong is also divided into two teams to deal with Shanghai and Tianjin. The lineup against Tianjin seems to be less strong than the one against Shanghai. The midfield, defense, and forwards are all good, but the goalkeeper is not very good. It is said that Mai Hadi is only a third-rate player. If Bao Jiaping can come, there will be no worries. It is hoped that there will be more strength. The appearance of Da and Xiao Gaoshan Nu in the interport game is the eighth time. In the future, their cooperation with Tan Jiangbai or Zheng Jiliang will be very promising.</p>
<p>Tianjin: Among the three teams, Tianjin is the strongest. The five forwards are all fierce and terrifying. Luo Jie, Jie Hansun, Fenjie, and Swiss are all world-renowned veterans. Qiong Si is also said to be exceptionally good. A Que'er has changed from center forward to left wing. The strength of the midfield is similar to that of Shanghai. Hei Er's header is unique. It is a pity that Da Sifo is not coming due to injury, and goalkeeper Mishakafu has been transferred to defense. The current goalkeeper has good skills. It is still hoped that Tianjin will be stronger.</p>
<h3>Today, Western United Football Youyou vs. Western Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Jinan vs. Shagu'er</p>
<p>Today, Saturday, in the Western United A Division football league, the Three Chinese teams will all play at the same time. However, according to the Western United Association's announcement yesterday, the game between Donghua and Lexi in Yiyuan will be temporarily postponed. Jinan vs. Shagu'er is at Shen Garden. Jinan's main players have not been able to return in time, so the hope of victory is very slim. Youyou vs. Western Chamber of Commerce is at the baseball field. Youyou should be able to win. The game between Western Po and Huasaises is one of the most interesting scenes of the day, but it is a pity that it is at the racecourse and has nothing to do with the Chinese. Tomorrow, in the fifth week of the Junior Cup, Youyou vs. Qinghua is at Hongkou Park. Youyou's B team is quite strong, and there is a great hope of winning the C Division championship. There is also a chance of winning the Junior Cup. All the A Division Chinese teams have already lost hope. It is hoped that Youyou's B team will strive for a glimmer of glory. Encourage them! Fa Shang vs. British Navy, Fa Shang should be able to realize their ambition to complete their dominance and capture the "Hillbillies" in one fell swoop. The order is as follows:</p>

<h3>Guang Loses to Datong</h3>
<p>Youyou Beats Yaoguang (B1) 35 to 29</p>
<p>Tongji Beats Feixia (A2) 38 to 34</p>
<p>Datong Beats Qingguang (A2) 44 to 43</p>
<p>Zhanghua Beats Chizhi (A2) 62 to 39</p>
<p>Last night, in the three Shanghai Basketball Association A2 group matches, the one between Qingguang and Datong was the most amusing. Datong led all the way and was quite smooth. In the first half, they won 24 to 16. In the second half, Qingguang rallied and the score increased greatly, seeming to have the potential to overtake. In the end, Zhang Jinxiang's two shots made it 43 to 44, with Qingguang only one point behind. At this time, there were more than 20 seconds left. Tan Dahua got the ball and shot immediately. Although the ball did not go in, the opponent fouled, and they were penalized twice. Tan's free throws are usually known as his forte, but unexpectedly, the first throw missed, and the second throw bounced out. Center Xu Peiran scored 25 points alone, which was a great contribution.</p>
<p>Tongji and Feixia were evenly matched and could be called brothers in distress. The competition between the two teams was very even, but the performance was not very exciting. In the first half, Feixia led 16 to 10. In the second half, Tongji reversed the score by 10 points. As a result, Tongji won 38 to 34.</p>
<p>Zhanghua vs. Chizhi: Although the score was very close in the first half, Chizhi was definitely not an opponent. Although they struggled hard, Zhanghua was still relaxed and content. The size of the score was entirely controlled by whether Zhanghua was happy or not. At first, it was 12 to 12, and in the first half, it was 28 to 18. The first ten minutes of the second half were still uneventful. Afterwards, Zhanghua's work became slightly tighter, and they won 62 to 39.</p>

<h3>Smith Will Perform Billiards Skills at Xiqing</h3>
<p>Two Games Scheduled for the Evening of the 15th</p>
<p>Li Gongying to Accompany Again</p>
<p>World professional billiard master Willie Smith came to Shanghai for sightseeing this time, and took the opportunity to continue to hold eight performances in four days at the Lianhua General Association. Yesterday, it was over. Man Luojun, the chairman of the billiard committee of the Xiqing Association, specially invited him to perform at the association, and also invited the Chinese Billiard King Li Gongying to participate in order to promote art and promote it. The dates are two games on the afternoon of the 15th at 6:00 PM and 9:15 PM in the evening. The association will start selling admission tickets today. The number of blue seats is limited, and it is feared that they will be turned away at the last minute.</p>
<h3>Not in Vain</h3>
<p>Smith is known as an all-rounder on the world professional billiards stage. This is his first time in Shanghai. More than a hundred people who admired him went to appreciate his art day and night. Mayor Wu, Secretary-General Yu, Director Pan, Lin Kanghou, Ma Yinliang, etc. of this city have also been guests of honor one after another. After watching, they all praised and deeply felt that this kind of skill is indeed rare in the country, and there is a need to promote it. The general Chinese and Western billiards players are even more concerned, paying attention to the way he holds the cue and the way he uses it in order to understand the principle. Therefore, Smith's arrival must have contributed to the billiards world in Shanghai. Smith can be said to have not made this trip in vain.</p>
<h3>Masterful Skills</h3>
<p>The eight performances in four days clearly show us that he is proficient in all kinds of other shooting methods. He is truly an all-rounder. What he considers to be his best skill is to pre-lead the opponent's ball to the left and right of the red ball's position, send the red ball with one shot, and the original ball rolls next to it, forming a triangle. Then open it up, send red, and circulate each other. It saves effort and makes it easier to score points. The Shanghai new record of 670 points was also achieved.</p>
<h3>Gongying is Unique</h3>
<p>The people selected to attend the performance on the Shanghai side were Li Gongying (three times), Liu Fuzong, Xu Shizhang, Kang Busi, Bo Tuo, and Medina (once each). In terms of the skills they showed, Li Gongying was the most popular. In front of the world famous players, he showed his ambition. His attitude was calm and his results were good. It was commendable. The other gentlemen were also able to work hard and specialize, and both advantages and disadvantages were visible. However, Medina did not play well last night. His usual performance can be on par with Gongying, but he completely lost his normal state last night.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Game</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the first game against Bo Tuo, a total of 27 shots were made. Smith scored 1,008 points, an average of more than 37 points. Bo Tuo scored 131 points, an average of about 5 points. In the second game against Medina, a total of 20 shots were made. Smith scored 1,163 points, an average of more than 58 points. Medina scored 100 points in 19 shots, an average of more than 5 points. The highest points of the day were Smith 151, 381, 191, 214, 589, Bo Tuo 20, 21, Medina 24, 14.</p>

<p>In one day, I discovered two things—two absolutely contradictory things.</p>
<p>In the morning, a friend named Peng came to see me. He's involved in education, so we talked about the situation in the education sector in Wu County. He said: Education in Wu County can't be considered backward, but the overcrowding of teachers is unexpected. There are already more than seven hundred people registered with the Education Bureau who don't have jobs. Among them, only about one-third are graduates from regular normal schools. The rest are from various schools, even university students and students who studied abroad. Because they can't find other opportunities, they're willing to settle for this cold bench life.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but click my tongue and say: This can truly be called an abundance of talent. It's a pity that so much talent has been buried. How pitiful!</p>
<p>In the afternoon, another friend involved in the chemical industry came to see me. He said: Our factory now wants to hire someone who has specialized research in the chemical industry. Knowing that you have wide connections, I ask you to help find someone.</p>
<p>I still had the morning's matter on my mind. I couldn't help but laugh and say: There are so many talented people in Suzhou. For a factory like yours (a medium-sized factory with 10,000 to 20,000 capital), can't you find a suitable person? Surely you're not looking for someone particularly extraordinary.</p>
<p>My friend laughed and said: To be honest, we've already advertised in the newspaper. Quite a few people applied, including many with specialized industrial degrees. We invited dozens of those we considered qualified to talk, but they were either completely clueless or just spouted empty words. There was absolutely no one who could actually do the work themselves. It's not that we look down on people, but we can't afford the masters and PhDs of foreign origin. The domestically produced talents we can afford are not suitable. Even if there are any, they've all become some kind of "technical officers" or "technicians" and wouldn't deign to come to a factory to work hard. Otherwise, why would I bother to ask you?</p>
<p>I laughed and said: If that's the case, I'll have to politely decline. Because I haven't seen anyone like you described.</p>
<p>After my friend left, I grumbled about unrelated things for a long time. It's said that it costs 100,000 yuan to educate a student abroad and 100 yuan to educate a primary school student. From the abolition of the imperial examination system and the establishment of schools in the late Qing Dynasty to now, over thirty years, I don't know how much money has been spent. What we've created are just many "(people)," not "(talent)." So, on the one hand, we cry "overstaffing," while on the other hand, we still feel a "lack of talent."</p>
<p>Who created these two contradictory phenomena? Probably the authorities in charge of education and the famous figures leading education for the past few decades must bear some responsibility? Especially those friends who treat students as experimental products, with a new "ism" every three days and a new method every five days.</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts on Celebrating the New Year According to the Old Calendar</h3>
<p>— Cao Wenhai</p>
<p>The Republic of China has been established for twenty-three years. Although government offices adopted the Gregorian calendar long ago and newspapers also switched to Gregorian dates, the common people still habitually use the old lunar calendar, and this entrenched custom is unbreakable. Two years ago, the National Government issued an order to the whole country to adopt the Gregorian calendar and abolish the lunar calendar. Party branches at all levels once extensively promoted this, and the government repeatedly admonished, no less than issuing three orders and five injunctions. However, observing all the recent actions of the common people, the image of celebrating the New Year remains. The New Year's rice cakes in the cake shops, the melon seeds and peanuts in the dried goods stores, the tea snacks and candies, and the meat and fruit shops, etc., their retail business is unusually busy. The wives and grandmothers in the mansions, the maids and elder sisters, and the shop clerks in the various stores, etc., are bustling about all day long, an endless stream, which shows a glimpse of respect for the New Year.</p>
<p>Recently, at night, various shops and wealthy families have even held "Year-end Thanks," offering whole pigs and whole sheep to the Kitchen God and other deities, making grand displays, staying up all night, with gongs and drums, and firecrackers, disturbing people's dreams. Every time at this time, setting off firecrackers for "Year-end Thanks" causes sparks to rise high, scattering on the roofs, inevitably causing fires. Those who suffer the disaster are mostly poor families. At a time of biting northerly winds, their homes are burned, leading to hunger and cold, which is also a matter of extreme joy turning into sorrow.</p>
<p>Walking into the City God Temple in the South City, I saw stalls lined up, like an open-air market. Recently, the best business is drawing monthly calendars, narcissus, orchids, wintersweet, and Nandina domestica branches from flower stalls, and children's toy stores and firecracker stores, etc., are also making three times the profit.</p>
<p>When it comes to the Gregorian New Year's Day, those who are elders often give silver dollars to the younger generation, called "lucky money." Ordinary ignorant children use this to buy sweets and learn to gamble, which is a waste of unconsciousness, which is a pity! During this Children's Year, parents should save their children's "lucky money" for them, accumulating little by little, wouldn't that be a blessing for the children?</p>
<p>The above-mentioned matters are deep-rooted bad habits that have been around for thousands of years. Ignorant and foolish people are not worthy of deep blame. But those who claim to be the intellectual class also follow the customs and do not make any effort to get rid of the old and bring forth the new, or make any plans to change customs and habits, which is what we do not understand.</p>
<h3>A Visit to Tan's Tomb</h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhizheng</p>
<p>Generally, anyone who has been to the capital will always want to visit the mausoleum of the Premier. Indeed, at the foot of the majestic Purple Mountain, the Premier's mausoleum is naturally the only building that can be called magnificent. However, in addition to Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum, I feel that there is also a Tan's Tomb that is more elegant and more serenely beautiful.</p>
<p>Tan's Tomb is the tomb of the late Premier of the Executive Yuan, Tan Yankai. It is about three li to the right of Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum, and just behind Linggu Temple. This year, I happened to be in Nanjing on business. After my friends took me to the usual Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum, Ming Mausoleum, and Five Continents Park, they talked about how elegant the newly completed Tan's Tomb was, so we decided to pay our respects.</p>
<p>After leaving Zhongshan Gate for about seven or eight li, the car stopped in front of Linggu Temple. Although Linggu Temple has now become a leisure resort for important people, after going inside, it is just a very ordinary temple. Tan's Tomb is right next to it, perhaps because Premier Tan often came here during his lifetime!</p>
<p>At the entrance of the tomb, there is a huge stone tablet, which says "Monument to the National Funeral of Premier Tan." It was inscribed by Chiang Kai-shek, the Chairman of the National Government at that time. Moving forward, the road is paved with gravel, and ancient trees with intertwined branches grow on both sides. Gradually climbing the mountain, a memorial hall is revealed in front of us. The memorial hall is purely in the palace style, with painted beams and carved pillars, beautiful and pleasing to the eye. In the center is a portrait of Premier Tan. Eulogies from various important people hang on the four walls. On the table are silver shields and silver screens, which are especially worth seeing, and there are several pairs of porcelain vases, about four or five feet high, arranged very exquisitely.</p>
<p>The memorial hall only has one room. After leaving the memorial hall, I searched for the tomb on all sides, but couldn't find it. I thought that maybe the tomb was just below the memorial hall, but I thought that it wouldn't be so simple. My friends led me up the mountain again, and after turning a few bends, Tan's Tomb was indeed reached. The tomb is made of cement, and in front of the tomb, white stone steps with railings are carved. On both sides, there are small pavilions, also in the palace style. From the entrance all the way to the front of the tomb, there are pots of fresh flowers.</p>
<p>The tomb is halfway up Purple Mountain, looking out at Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum and Ming Mausoleum, they are precisely in a mutually supporting position. The forests are vast and boundless, and the sound of the spring is gurgling, what a serene place for eternal rest!</p>
<p>After sitting for a while, I followed the original path down the mountain, and next to the memorial hall, I discovered a memorial park. This park was donated by the Hunan Provincial Government, because Premier Tan was from Hunan, and the Hunan authorities at that time were the old subordinates who were most deeply favored by Premier Tan. Therefore, this memorial park was also built very exquisitely. In addition to flowers and trees, there are pavilions and halls, springs, and small bridges, as well as memorial inscriptions praising his merits, which shows how deeply Premier Tan was missed after his death.</p>
<p>After visiting Tan's Tomb, I felt that Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum was indeed magnificent, but it was unobstructed and lacked twists and turns. Although Tan's Tomb is small, the land is secluded and the terrain is obstructed, with plenty of changes. From entering the National Funeral Monument to reaching the tomb, it is a full half a li, sometimes hidden and sometimes visible, winding several times. The designing engineer must have put in a lot of effort.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that tourists who visit the capital in the future will never forget this good place - Premier Tan's Tomb.</p>
<h3>The Northeast Four Company Commanders</h3>

<p>Chapter Twenty-Fourth</p>
<p>Drinking and Passing Food, Madly Celebrating, Containing Farewell Tears</p>
<p>Picking Up the Lamp to Warm Dreams, Singing Softly Through the Long Night</p>
<p>Zi Qiang answered casually: That's right, in about half a month, it might snow outside the pass. When Zhao Weng heard these words, he couldn't help but feel his heart skip a beat, and he immediately thought, what if a war breaks out, what should I do? So he closed his eyes and pretended to be thinking intently about something. At the same time, the two tears that were about to roll out were also closed in his eyes and did not come out. Zi Qiang didn't dare to sit here anymore, and saying that he was going to tidy things up, he also went back to his room and lay down. When it was time for dinner, Gui Zhi led Zi Qiang to the hall, and he saw four large plates placed in the center of the table, filled with things like sausages and oil-soaked chicken. Two large plates of meat pies were placed diagonally across the table, and a brightly lit white-shade kerosene lamp was shining below, along with a tin wine pot. Gui Zhi sat down at the bottom, pointed to the empty chair on her left hand, and said: You sit down. When Zhao Zi Qiang saw his father and mother-in-law sitting on the other two sides, he laughed and said: Placing the table in the middle, with four people sitting on four sides, it looks like a feast. Gui Zhi picked up the wine pot and poured wine into the empty glass on the left, and laughed: As the saying goes, the gift may be light, but the sentiment is heavy, sending a goose feather from a thousand miles away. This is just a feast of two large plates of meat pies, but my good intentions are true, and you should eat it as if it were a feast of shark fin and bird's nest. If you agree with what I said, then first drink a toast. Zhao Zi Qiang didn't say anything more, picked up his glass and drank it dry in one gulp, and even held it up to take a look. Jiang Shi, holding her chopsticks, laughed and said: Our young lady, you're even more eloquent today. Gui Zhi laughed and said: Is this considered eloquent? I'm still planning to talk to him all night long. As she spoke, the wine pot in her hand had already stretched out in front of Zi Qiang. Zi Qiang held his glass with both hands and accepted her wine, and laughed: I have to return the toast, right? Gui Zhi hugged the wine pot to her chest, and laughed: No, today I'm seeing you off, I'll save it until I go to Qian'an, and you can drink it to welcome me. (313)</p>

<h3>The Evolution of Vacuum Tubes</h3>
<p>— Yi Zhi</p>
<p>Foreword</p>
<p>Wireless radio has only been around for a little over thirty years since its invention, but the rapid progress it has made should be attributed to the vacuum tube, the soul of wireless radio. Since the English Fleming created the diode, it wasn't long before tetrodes, pentodes, heptodes, AC tubes, and filamentless tubes appeared one after another, numbering over a hundred. With so many vacuum tubes, their characteristics are becoming more and more complex. If I were to describe the evolution of vacuum tubes in detail, this publication's limited space would not allow it. Therefore, I will only select the more important ones and briefly describe them in categories below.</p>
<p>Diodes | Triodes</p>
<p>In 1884, Edison added an electrode to his invented vacuum bulb and discovered a current phenomenon. Scholars at the time could not explain the reason and called it the "Edison Effect." In 1886, the Englishman Fleming applied Edison's phenomenon to create a diode for detection and rectification. In 1889, Thomson and Richardson explained the working principle of vacuum tubes with the electron theory, saying that when the filament is heated, it evaporates electrons, which are then attracted by the positively charged plate, forming the Edison effect. In 1907, the American De Forest added a metal mesh grid between the filament and the plate in the diode, greatly increasing the efficiency, and created the triode. In 1915, the American Longmirm increased the vacuum of De Forest's soft triode, making it a hard triode. At this time, the triode had reached its development peak and could be used for oscillation, amplitude modulation, detection, and amplification.</p>
<p>Tetrodes | Pentodes</p>
<p>Triodes used for radio frequency amplification are prone to oscillation and add noise due to their large interelectrode capacitance and electron reflection. Therefore, the German Schottky and the American A.W. Hull invented the tetrode, such as UX-22. Its structure is to add another grid, called the "screen grid," between the grid and the plate of the triode. This tube is truly unexpected. Its high radio frequency amplification, small interelectrode capacitance, good sensitivity, and good selectivity are far superior to triodes. However, due to the limitations of its characteristics, this tube can only be used for radio frequency amplification. Researchers added another grid between the screen grid and the plate of this tetrode, connected to the cathode, to prevent the secondary emission of electrons. As a result, the plate current increased greatly and the output power was very large. It is most suitable for amplification in the audio frequency range, and is called the power pentode, such as the 247 tube.</p>
<p>AC Tubes | Directly Heated, Indirectly Heated, Rapidly Heated As wireless telephone became increasingly developed, it was uneconomical and troublesome to supply the vacuum tubes of radios with dry batteries or storage batteries. Therefore, AC tubes were created. Initially, there was only the directly heated type, which reduced the filament resistance of the triode to reduce AC hum, such as UX-226, etc. Later, an improved type was created, called the indirectly heated type, which isolated the filament from the cathode. The filament is only used for heating, and the cathode is only used for emission, such as Uy-227, etc. The AC hum of this tube is very low, but the filament must pass heat to the cathode through an insulator, so the vacuum tube of this type operates very slowly. Therefore, it was further improved, with the insulator piercing through the air, so that the cathode could obtain the radiant heat emitted by the filament, and the operation could be faster, called the rapidly heated type, such as the new 227-224-A, etc.</p>
<p>Dual-Grid Triodes | Twin Triodes, Dual-Plate Triodes, Dual-Plate Pentodes | Heptodes</p>
<p>Ordinary triodes, if the input signal voltage is too high, will cause distortion, so the dual-grid triode was invented, such as the 46 tube. The input signal can be increased by one time compared to ordinary triodes. Also, according to the principle of push-pull Class B amplification, two triodes are placed in one tube, called the twin triode, such as the 2B6 tube. To avoid the increasing complexity of the circuit, one tube is used for multiple purposes, such as detection, amplification, and volume control, or radio frequency amplification, intermediate frequency amplification, oscillation, etc. Therefore, dual-plate triodes (Diode Triode) such as 55·85 tubes, etc., were made. There are also dual-plate pentodes (Diode pentode) such as 2B7·6B, etc. There are also heptodes such as 2A7·6A7, etc.</p>

<p>Cathode and IIOV high voltage tube High tension tube manufacturing,</p>
<p>The United States also created a filamentless tube. Furthermore, due to the rapid progress in the research of wireless film and ultra-short waves, cathode ray television tubes and shoe button tubes were invented.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Vacuum tubes have reached their peak, but European and American researchers are still working hard. Although we cannot predict how they will develop in the future, judging from the current situation, the internal structure of vacuum tubes will become more and more complex, and one tube will be used for multiple cycles, which will be more effective than the latest 2A7 and 2B7 tubes.</p>
<h3>Vacuum Tubes for Detection</h3>
<p>— Gao Chongling</p>
<p>The components in a radio receiver that perform the function of detection can be divided into two categories: one is the crystal in a crystal radio, and the other is the vacuum tube.</p>
<p>Vacuum tubes for detection (Tube as detector) are an indispensable component in vacuum tube radios, just like the crystal in a crystal radio. Every radio must have at least one detection vacuum tube. Superheterodyne radios are even divided into first and second detection vacuum tubes. For example, the vacuum tube in the simplest one-tube radio is the detection tube, the two-tube radio has a detection tube and a low-frequency amplification tube, and the three-tube radio has a high-frequency amplification tube, a detection tube, and a low-frequency amplification tube, etc. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Domestic and Foreign News</h3>
<p>A Glimpse of the Business of Tian'er Wireless Radio Company. Tian'er Company is known for repairing radios. It can solve all difficult problems of radios because the company has specialized talent. Mr. Zhuang Zhihong, the manager of the company, is not only good at repairing radios, but also has a deep understanding of repairing sound film machines. It is said that yesterday, the machine of a major cinema suddenly stopped working. It was repaired by famous Western technicians in Shanghai many times, but it could not be restored to its original state. Later, it was repaired by Mr. Zhuang, and it was completed within two hours, and the sound was even better than before. The company's exquisite technology can be seen from this. Chinese people who have radios and need repairs may want to give it a try.</p>
<p>Mr. William, the factory director of Eagle Emperor Brand, said that in the past week, due to the prosperous business in the factory, the existing workers were not enough, so 600 new workers were added. Currently, the factory employs more than 2,600 workers, and there is still a shortage of manpower. Therefore, more workers will be hired in the near future.</p>
<p>Germany's Radio Day: Recently, the German Broadcasting Wireless Radio has stipulated a broadcasting day, hoping that people across the country will purchase a radio on this day to listen to the government's broadcast to the people on this day. Rural farmers who have not purchased a radio can borrow to listen at places where radios are available, in order to ensure that all German citizens can listen to the broadcast on this day.</p>

<h3>Extremely Idle Financial and Gold Markets</h3>
<p>Total Daily Transactions Only Exceed 10,000 Taels</p>
<p>Total Number of Chips Decreasing Daily</p>
<p>The gold market remains stable, fluctuating extremely narrowly, with few transactions within the market, and the market conditions are extremely mediocre. In the early morning, overseas silver markets saw British rises and American stability, with the five metals exchange's forward silver price rising by five haos to two li. Exchange rates continued to rise, London's raw gold rose three pence, American cotton rose ten points, and American wheat rose six two five. Stock prices saw both rises and falls, but because of slightly better conditions for large speculators, the opening prices, although weak, were still considered acceptable. After the opening, the sentiment weakened as banks relaxed their appetite, but because the shilling exchange rate remained unchanged, the market was stable, and the price fell but then rebounded. Afterwards, although Reuters reported that American Senator Thomas stated that he believed inflation was still ongoing, because banks suddenly seized shillings and forward American dollars, the market strengthened instead, and the gold market gradually rose. In the end, the situation was calm and idle again. The after-market remained idle throughout, fluctuating only by one yuan and one jiao, naturally lacking special changes. The gold market for March futures seems to be approaching a dead state, with total daily transactions only exceeding 10,000 taels, and the number of chips is also decreasing daily. The chixia price is 1,130 yuan. The market conditions for the day are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Morning: Opened at 703 yuan and 8 jiao, a decrease of 7 jiao compared to the previous close. Goods opened at 3 yuan and a half, and the exchange market opened with a near-term selling price of 1 shilling and 4 pence and 25, and the American exchange rate was 33 yuan and 875. Mitsui set the May American dollar at 3125. Zhifengyong, Yidayong, Qingfayong, Hongli, and Fuyu sold at 2 yuan and 6 jiao. Fuchang and Yifengyongjin's paper rose back to 3 yuan and 8 jiao, but because Anda and Zhengjin released April American dollars at 25, Citibank set March at 125, and Hengyu and Fuyu, etc., sold paper, Hengxing and Yifengyong, although buying, gradually retreated to 1 yuan and 3 jiao. However, because Xie Kang, Hongli, Yifengyong, Hengyu, etc., took advantage of the low prices and bought, HSBC announced that the British exchange rate was flat and the American exchange rate rose 125. At this time, it had risen back to more than 3 yuan, and the market became flat. Zhengjin纳 June American dollars at 5625, Shanghai Communications扒 the same month at half a yuan, and Lai Jiali came to扒 the shilling. Goods, Zhifengyong, and Yidayong, etc., rushed to purchase paper, and it rose to 5 yuan. Huabi set March American dollars at 0625. Bingxing, Yuanfengyong, etc., had some supply, and it fell again to 3 yuan and 8 jiao. The trading within the market was quiet, and the market was idle. After lingering, the afternoon close was 704 yuan and 1 jiao, and goods were auctioned at 3 yuan and 9 jiao.</p>
<p>Afternoon: The market opened at 703 yuan and 8 jiao, and goods opened at 4 yuan. It was immediately seen that the market was idle, the sentiment was still stable, and the situation was also stable. Pangen released May American dollars at 3125, and Yuanbaichun 脱手, retreated from 4 yuan and 7 to 4 yuan. Huabi扒 April shillings at 4375, May 便士, Hengxing although进, rose again to 4 yuan and 7 jiao. However, because Yidayong, Shunli, and goods had some supply, it retreated to 3 yuan and 9 jiao. Dafayong and Hengxing limited the market and wanted to 进, making it difficult to挫 again. Shunli suddenly came to buy进, and although Hongxing was selling, it still rebounded. Hengtai, Yuankangxiang, and Dadecheng also had to 납胃, and it rose to 4 yuan and 9 jiao. Hengxing and Hongxing sold paper, the banks' appetite remained塞, and the closing price was 704 yuan and a half, and goods were auctioned at 4 yuan. After the close, Hongxing sold and the downstream. It was found that the highest price for the day was 705 yuan, and the lowest price was 701 yuan and 3 jiao, a difference of 3 yuan and 7 jiao. The result was the same as the previous close.</p>
<p>The announced price was because HSBC's British exchange rate remained unchanged, still calculated at 1 shilling, 4 pence, and 125, and the gold price合标 by the exchange rate was over 716 yuan. According to the closing price, it was about 12 yuan. There was not much difference from the previous close. The registration price for this month was 718 yuan, 704 yuan for March, 718 yuan for the morning's supplementary water, and 719 yuan for the afternoon's supplementary water. The chixia price was 1,130 yuan. There were not many transactions in the market, only 500 taels were sold by the Tianjin Gang to Tongfengyong, and the transaction price was 1,133 yuan. There were no transactions in the after-market. There are currently 6,433 paper left for February.</p>
<p>The market's transactions were light and idle. In summary, Hongxing, Hengyu, Fuyu, Shenkang, Fuan, Dafayong, and Shunli, etc., were on the selling side, and Zhifengyong, Wanxing, Yicheng, Yifengyong, Yongde, Yuanmaoyong, Hengtai, Yuankangxiang, and Xiekang, etc., were on the buying side. Hengxing先进后出, Yidayong and Hongli先出后进, Dalian Bang Wanxing共做 more than 800 paper,轧进 four hundred or so, Shunli共做 more than 400 paper,略有轧出, Guang Bang Hengxing进 more than one hundred paper, out less than one hundred paper. On that day, the total number of transactions was 12,215 in the morning and 2,737 in the afternoon. As of today, there are 28,609 March chips, with a total of 31 long positions and 58 short positions.</p>
<h3>Exchange Rate: Pound Flat, Dollar Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to foreign dispatches, the London prime rate rose to .0625 for both near and far terms. The Bank of America remained unchanged. The forward silver price rose by 1.1%. Pound against the dollar rose to .625, while the dollar against the pound rose by 2.75%. The pound against the franc fell by 8.2 centimes, while the dollar against the franc rose by 1.025 centimes. London spot gold rose by 3 pence. Private cables showed the silver price rising by .1875, with exchange rates up by 2.5%. In morning trading, the near-term settlement price opened at 1 shilling 4.25 pence for the pound and 33.875 yuan for the dollar. Compared to the previous close, this indicated a tight .0625 for the pound and a loose .0625 for the dollar. After the opening, banks flooded the market, and the dollar seemed to loosen. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank's listing revealed the dollar up by .125, the franc down by 6 francs, and the mark down by .75, with the rest unchanged. Thereafter, banks once brokered forward dollars and shillings, with a relatively good process. At noon, the market remained flat. In the afternoon, banks engaged in exchange rate arbitrage, and the process remained flat, with the situation fluctuating. By the close, the near-term selling price was 1 shilling 4.3125 pence for the pound and 34 yuan for the dollar, which was .1875 flatter for the pound and firmer for the dollar compared to the previous close. Chinese merchants converted over 200,000 yuan into dollars and flooded the market with 50,000 pounds. Banks engaged in exchange rate arbitrage. The day's transactions will be recorded below.</p>

<h3>Foreign Call Loan Market Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>| Busy Clearing Situation |</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign call loan market saw a slightly bearish sentiment, with prices unchanged at 2%. "Drawing a line" remained a symbolic gesture without any actual increase in funds. In terms of call loan transactions, morning transfers amounted to just over 1.1 million, with new transactions at just over 200,000. Afternoon transactions reached over 300,000, while the Small General Association saw just over 100,000 in transactions. While banks saw a large number of clearings, due to extended timelines, it was not possible to investigate as desired. Money shops cleared approximately 40 million in foreign public bills, but this could not be finalized until late at night, so no forecast could be made. Foreign "drawing a line" clearings amounted to 4-5 million, various remittance clearings amounted to over 300,000, foreign collateral transactions amounted to over 1.8 million, banknote inflows and outflows amounted to over 1 million, customer source inflows were 100,000, and outflows were 150,000. The total value of the city's clearing house exchange was 7,235,321.95 silver yuan, including 3,413,319.6 silver yuan in silver, and 3,822,001.99 silver yuan in remittance transfers.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Small Coins Suddenly Drop Over 6 Yuan</h3>
<p>Copper Coins Rise by 2,500 Cash</p>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangsu small foreign coins recovered by 3 yuan, with the morning market at 842 yuan and the afternoon market at 846 yuan. This resulted in an increase of 3 yuan compared to the previous day's afternoon market. Trading volume was 4,500 "jiao" in the morning and 7,000 "jiao" in the afternoon. Guangdong small foreign coins were at 777.5 yuan in the morning and 776.9 yuan in the afternoon. This resulted in a sudden drop of 6.1 yuan compared to the previous day's afternoon market. Trading volume was 50,000 "jiao" in the morning and 63,000 "jiao" in the afternoon. Copper coins increased by 2,500 cash to 297,500 cash, with a trading volume of 37,187,500 cash, equivalent to 11,500 foreign yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities: "Consolidated Six" Public Bonds See Strongest Gains</h3>
<p>Bullish Traders Tend to Abandon Troop Reduction and Consolidate "Consolidated Six"</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange was open for the last day of the old lunar year. Despite being the tail end, trading was not desolate. There was quite a bit of floating short covering, floating longs, and spread trading in the morning, settling accounts. Due to the holiday break, which spans nine days, preparations had to be made to avoid risks. However, most traders were still waiting to see what would happen after the "red board" reopening. With only four days remaining until February delivery after the reopening, market prices would not suddenly drop if the environment remained unchanged. Still, the supply and demand of chips should be the benchmark for price fluctuations. In the morning opening, short covering and buying-in were evident, and market prices rose uniformly by 0.12 to 0.45 yuan, with this month's "Consolidated Six" seeing the strongest gains. In the second session, some long traders covered, resulting in a slight decline, approximately 0.12 yuan. In the afternoon opening, the "50 series" and others were still in demand, and the upward trend did not diminish, recovering another 0.1 to 0.4 yuan. The closing was slightly chaotic but generally saw more gains than losses, mostly by 0.12 yuan, while "Consolidated Six" recovered another 0.45 yuan. Throughout the day, the trend of the most extreme "troop reduction" increase was only 0.05 to 0.1 yuan, due to heavier selling of "16 series." "Consolidated Six" saw the strongest gains, due to active buying of "17 series" and "33 series," coupled with short covering. As a result, this month saw a gain of 1.15 yuan, while the far term only saw a gain of 0.5 yuan. Bullish traders tend to abandon "troop reduction" and consolidate "Consolidated Six." As a result, market prices mostly saw gains of around 0.23 yuan, with near-term "Consolidated Six" alone gaining over 1 yuan, leading all bonds. The total trading volume was 13,443,000 yuan, including 3,000 yuan in spot, 4,885,000 yuan in total salt tax futures, 1,980,000 yuan in "troop reduction," 1,095,000 yuan in "19 Customs Revenue," 1,435,000 yuan in "20 Series 20 Customs Revenue," 2,665,000 yuan in gold short-term "Consolidated Six," and the rest in the range of 200,000-300,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Bank Draft Amounts Surge, Most New York Stocks Rebound</h3>
<p>The New York stock market showed tremendous rebound strength. Initially, it was weak, carrying on the previous day's fatigue. But shortly after, bank draft exchange amounts surged, commodity prices were firm, and things gradually improved. Mining stocks and industrial stocks rebounded first, and as a result, most stocks recovered from several "jiao" to 5 yuan. The market did not pay much attention to the upcoming management exchange proposals, the projected decrease in US Steel Corporation's January turnover, and the overstocking situation of General Motors Corporation. Bonds were mixed due to long covering. However, US government bonds and other high-quality bonds were very flat. The total daily trading volume was 2.2 million shares. Today's published broker lending totaled 930,000,000 yuan, an increase of 8,000,000 yuan from last week. The 60-day interest rate was 0.75%, and the 90-day rate was 1.5%. (Wheat) Longs continued to cover, and the Southwest remained arid. However, there was a lack of leadership among buyers. In terms of news, it should favor longs. (Cotton) Washington news regarding the Punkha case differed from yesterday, which improved sentiment. The market also surged from lows. Yarn mills showed hesitation, and ground prices were very high. The future will depend on the results of the acreage reduction legislation. The Dow Jones index is listed below.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Buying Momentum Remains Strong</h3>
<p>| Warehouse Yarn Inventory Gradually Decreasing |</p>
<p>The yarn market trend is firm, and the upward trend remains flat. Most do not see a very strong cotton yarn long position. However, the cotton market is rising daily, and a certain factory's receipts and warehouse chips are gradually shrinking.</p>
<h3>Man-Made Fiber Rises Slightly by 2 Yuan</h3>
<p>In the opening of the man-made fiber market's earlier session, due to the intense rise in American cotton, the buying interest became even more fervent, with each month rising by five "jiao." In the afternoon, there were even more buyers, and the futures market will be closed for the spring holiday starting today, reopening on February 19. Generally, short sellers wanted to clear out, causing the upward trend to rise again, with each month rising by 1.46 yuan. The total transaction statistics for the day were: a total of 35,750 bales were traded. Hengda sold 2,900 bales, Jinchang 1,500 bales, Tonghe 1,500 bales, Suilong 850 bales, Jifeng 750 bales, Senkang 800 bales, and Xincheng 1,200 bales. Dafeng bought 1,450 bales, Gengfeng 2,100 bales, Yicheng 1,300 bales, Yichang 1,750 bales, Xiesheng 1,700 bales, and Huikang 1,150 bales. The closing prices are listed below.</p>

<h3>Spot Yarn Also Rises by 1 Yuan</h3>
<p>Spot yarn sales remain good. According to statistics, various groups bought a total of 700 bales throughout the day. Market prices rose by 1 yuan. The purchase amounts of each group are recorded below:</p>
<p>Nanjing 5, Mainland 315, Guangdong 185, Peers 10, Xiamen 15, Changsha 40, Shantou 115, Ningbo 5</p>
<h3>Manufacturers Absorb Cotton, Upward Trend Continues</h3>
<p>The cotton market's upward trend intensifies. Due to the very intense rise in American cotton, and exchange rates have not seen major movements, the calculated cost is rising daily. Therefore, a certain factory is also doing a large amount of buying in the futures market. The business period is also the last day, and generally, retail investors, seeing the good overseas cotton situation, are buying more, causing the market price to skyrocket. As for what happens in the future, it will still depend on actual sales to decide whether to advance or retreat.</p>
<h3>Zheng Cotton Continues to Rise by 8-9 "Jiao"</h3>
<p>In the opening of Zheng Cotton's earlier session, the market atmosphere was still flat. Upon trading to the second or third session, it suddenly tightened, with each month rising by 0.2-0.3 yuan. In the afternoon, news of a good overseas cotton market was heard, and each month rose again by 0.5-0.6 yuan. The total transactions for the day were 139,600 "dan." Chunji sold 5,800 "dan," Dafeng 5,900 "dan," Yuanda 7-800 "dan," Taixing 3,000 "dan," Changyu 4,200 "dan," Hengde 3,100 "dan," Changhe 5,000 "dan," Gengfeng 3,700 "dan," and Xincheng 7,800 "dan."

<p>Total 640,300</p>
<p>April 4475 Up 90 173,600</p>
<h3>Spot Cotton Business Stagnates</h3>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is sluggish. Because futures cotton has skyrocketed, holders of goods are unwilling to lightly sell them off. Coupled with the upcoming lunar new year and a period of work stoppages, the business has completely stagnated. The source is estimated to be 600 bales of Yao cotton and 140 bales of Tong cotton.</p>
<p>Political News Favorable for Longs</p>
<h3>American Cotton Continues to Rise by Over 20 Points</h3>
<p>Yesterday's American cotton market initially fell due to mass selling, but later rose due to political news favoring longs and mass buying. As a result, spot prices rose by 20 points, and futures prices rose by 17 to 22 points. Liverpool</p>
<p>Spot cotton fell by 5 points, near-term fell by 2-3 points, and near-term rose by 1 point. Egyptian cotton spot fell by 12 points. The Bombay cotton market initially rose due to speculator buying, but later fell back due to selling by European exporters and long covering. As a result, Bengal fell by 2.5 rupees, Oomra fell by 1.5 rupees, and White Western fell by 2 rupees. The original telegram recorded left, (8th Telegram)</p>

<h3>Grain: Zhabei Rice Industry to Close Today</h3>
<p>Yesterday, only two or three ships arrived at the Zhabei river port. Because the market is coming to an end, all shops are preparing to settle accounts, so there were no transactions. Starting today (the 10th), there will be a nine-day holiday, and they will reopen on the 19th. It is estimated that there are about 100 ships with heavy loads at the river port.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Spring Sales of Silk Initiated</h3>
<p>(Lyon White Filature Again Reports Rise) Yesterday morning, the local French silk trading house, Sinvoux, received a telegram from the Lyon silk market stating that B-grade white filature 13/15 denier had opened at 69 francs per kilogram, up 2.5 francs from the beginning of the week. This translates to an increase of over 10 yuan per bale in Chinese currency. Although there was no change in A-grade on the surface, calculated by the franc exchange rate, each bale also secretly increased by 5-6 yuan.</p>
<p>(Douppioni Silk Printing Sales Remain Brisk) The demand for Indian douppioni silk remains brisk. Local inventory in Shanghai is thin. In the recent decade, British mail ships have loaded 80 yuan worth of douppioni silk, shipped to India via England.</p>
<p>(Shanghai Silk Market Also Shows Firm Rise) Silk merchants in New York, Lyon, London, and other ports have already implemented restrictions on the sale and use of Japanese silk. Furthermore, with the initiation of spring sales, the consumption of raw silk has increased sharply, inventory is gradually thinning, and factories are diligently importing. The Chinese silk market continues to show an upward trend. Various European and American firms in Shanghai have started buying. The market atmosphere is increasingly firm. Yesterday, firms from England, France, and other countries imported 70 bales of yellow and white filature, with prices rising sharply by 20 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tea Houses' Green Tea Exports Still Strong</h3>
<p>The tea market for foreign firms in this port has seen very few transactions recently. This is because the tea suitable for sales in the market is extremely rare among Chinese merchants, and the lower-grade goods from lower-end firms have stagnant sales channels, resulting in a market with no activity. However, the various green teas that foreign firms imported last year, such as Luzhuang Zhenmei and Zhenmei needles, after a large portion had been weighed and delivered, still had over 20,000 boxes. In recent days, firms such as Xiehe, Jardine Matheson, Jinlong, and Xiezhuhui have been transporting and paying for these teas separately. Today, the French Postal Shipping Company's Asia Express is exporting 8,000 boxes of Luzhuang green tea delivered by various foreign firms. It is said that a large batch will continue to be shipped out during the next shipping schedule.</p>
<h3>A Review of the Woolen Fabric Market in the Past Year</h3>
<p>Still Inferior to the Year Before in Terms of Overall Observation</p>
<p>Autumn and Winter Seasonality Outperforms Spring and Summer</p>
<p>Last year, the woolen fabric market was still inferior to the year before, indicating the bankruptcy of the rural economy and the decline of urban industry and commerce. The market conditions over the past year, including price fluctuations, are summarized below:</p>
<p>(January) Apart from cavalry twill and checked worsted showing a firmer trend, the rest were sluggish and declining. This was due to the approach of the end of the lunar year, and buyers were cautious about importing goods. (February) Spring sales began, and goods of all kinds were selling briskly, especially in high demand from all directions in the street. However, the opening prices for the "red board" were generally cheaper than in 1932. This was because the pound sterling had lengthened, which lowered costs. Fortunately, the arrival of new goods at the port was very scarce, allowing prices to be maintained without falling. The reason for the lack of new goods arriving at the port was that factories abroad had previously gone on strike, resulting in delayed deliveries. (March) Various goods with delayed deliveries from foreign factories were shipped to Shanghai one after another, causing prices to plummet. Yuanzhigong plain serge and worsted, etc., became even more chaotic. Fitted materials such as Hanling bouclé and flannel showed a firmer trend. (April) Prices became even more fatigued, with both apparent and hidden weaknesses. The woolen fabrics of the same brand sold for vastly different prices, and customers often negotiated to drive prices down. This was supposed to be a peak sales season, but the market atmosphere was sluggish, due to oversupply, combined with inconsistent costs of new and old goods, the impact of Japanese dumping, and unstable times, which weakened the purchasing power of customers, creating such a situation. (May) Flannel, hemp canvas, summer white goods, and the like sold very smoothly. However, the market price continued to decline without showing any signs of recovery. After the new tariff rules were announced, many goods changed from ad valorem tariffs to specific tariffs, increasing the cost of woolen fabrics, and prices gradually began to rise. (June) Due to the increased tariffs, various wool textiles that were in season gradually rose in price. The industry association once petitioned for relief but was denied, which further strengthened the market trend. However, plain serge and thin floral worsted fabrics around 4 yuan were still in the lower reaches, because of a large batch of Japanese goods being dumped in Shanghai. (July) It was the height of summer, and there should have been a pause, but merchants from Sichuan suddenly made large purchases. Domestic camel wool, Yuanchang yellow-grey worsted, thick plain fabric shoe felt fabric, East China serge floral fabric, etc., saw many transactions, which boosted the market atmosphere. (August) The woolen fabric market made great progress, and prices also turned firm. There were transactions from customers in Tianjin, Sichuan, Peiping, Qingdao, and the Yangtze River region. Western-style suit fabrics were even more popular, and merchants in the industry were optimistic about orders. (September) Except for plain serge, which was heavily impacted by Japanese goods, other goods were better than in August. Purchases from local and outside customers were strong, and prices were firm both domestically and externally. The British firm, Dodwell &amp; Co., first announced an increase in the price of standard woolen fabrics, and as a result, many firms followed suit by raising prices (this month can be said to be the best of the entire year). (October) The trend was similar to September. In the second half of the month, woolen fabric postal packages suddenly decreased, and customers from all regions temporarily stopped adding to their purchases, because starting from the 18th of this month, the post office suddenly wanted to collect taxes on woolen fabric packages. (November) After the woolen fabric industry association worked to negotiate with the authorities, the authorities immediately understood and canceled the postal package tax, allowing deliveries to be accompanied by customs import permits. As a result, the number of woolen fabric export packages remained congested, and the market atmosphere was good. Although there was news of Fujian's independence, it did not have much impact. French washable floral fabric, cavalry twill, and three types of cavalry twill were especially strong and active. (December) Foreign firms raised prices, and the selling prices of thick and thin goods remained firm. However, sales were slightly sluggish, creating an atmosphere of apparent firmness and hidden loosening. Coupled with pressure from East China goods and the end of the Chinese calendar year, shops were carefully extending credit and seeking to recover debts, and transactions gradually decreased.</p>

<h3>Year-End</h3>
<p>— Fan Zhongyun</p>
<p>After the New Calendar Year comes the Old Calendar Year. For us poor people, the New Year is indeed a significant hurdle, truly living up to its name as the "Year-End Hurdle."</p>
<p>With the Year-End Hurdle arriving, debts come all at once, and with empty hands, it is extremely difficult to get through: this is the first difficulty. Moreover, with the New Year approaching, a joyous festival, there must be timely decorations and social interactions among family and friends. However, with empty pockets, what to do? What to do! At this time, in the deep of the night, listening to the sounds of firecrackers everywhere, it feels as if each sound is hitting the heart. Counting the days until the end of the year, it is only a matter of a few days, but such time feels like a year passing by.</p>
<p>Most unbearable is that in the past, there was only the Old Calendar Year, but now, with the addition of the New Calendar Year, we must pass through two Year-End Hurdles each year. At the end of the New Calendar Year, shop transactions and bank overdrafts must be settled. However, new activities must wait until after the Old Calendar Year. Thus, between these New and Old Year-End Hurdles, we are like fish trapped in a dried-up rut, forced to struggle and die. Today, we seem like Wu Zixu passing through the Zhaoguan pass, passing one hurdle after another. With our hearts burning with anxiety, we unknowingly find that our temples have suddenly turned gray.</p>
<p>Being in the intersection of the old and new eras, this is our inevitable fate. Because such phenomena are not limited to the New Year alone, but are true in all other aspects.</p>
<p>Many people, for the sake of neatness and convenience, have changed to Western clothing. However, upon returning home, they feel the comfort of Chinese clothing. Thus, wardrobes must contain both Chinese and Western clothing, and cloth shoes and leather shoes must be purchased simultaneously.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the family, traditional women, although capable of managing the household, are not skilled in social interactions. Modern women, on the other hand, are highly skilled in social gatherings and interactions, but not good at managing the household. Thus, husbands, for the sake of the family, do not know what to do.</p>
<p>The old is worth cherishing, and the new must also be adapted to, thus we suffer to the extreme!</p>
<p>Habit and the times force us to pass through two Year-End Hurdles, and thus we have become victims for no good reason.</p>
<h3>How to Eliminate "Shanghai Style"?</h3>
<p>— Yi Jun</p>
<p>Since someone from the North began to mock the so-called "Shanghai Style" writers (referring to some degenerate elements in the Shanghai New Literature scene), the non-"Shanghai Style" writers in Shanghai have also felt the need to speak out. A few days ago, someone in "Free Talk" clearly stated that "the non-'Shanghai Style' writers in Shanghai should rise up to clarify themselves, and there is no need to trouble the 'Beijing Style' writers to launch a distant expedition." This shows that the hatred of evil is a universal feeling. Kicking those shameless literary scoundrels out of our New Literary world is indeed the right thing to do!</p>
<p>However, so far, the attacks have been limited to the realm of pure literature, which I believe is incorrect. In my opinion, the movement to eradicate "Shanghai Style" should be extended to the entire writing world.</p>
<p>Those current affairs commentators who have others write articles for them, relying on flattery to beg for the pity of the chief editor and get them published, and then go around deceiving and swindling; those authors who hire a large number of literary slaves at home, copying and pasting from magazines and newspapers to plagiarize and turn them into books, and publish them under their own names; those international experts who don't understand any foreign languages, but rely on clerical skills to hire a few extremely bored translators to translate Japanese into Chinese and then Chinese into English, and publish them under their own names, taking advantage of all sides. Aren't these precisely the practices of "Shanghai Style" writers? Why hasn't anyone come out to attack them? Is it because everyone's mouths have been stuffed shut by a meal and drinks from these "Shanghai Style" writers?</p>
<p>In my view, these "Shanghai Style" writers are more evil than those Shanghai Style novelists. Although they are unlearned and incompetent, their methods of scheming and maneuvering are first-class. They often have the magic power to control cultural institutions and can exert extremely bad influence on China's cultural and writing circles. I believe that to eliminate "Shanghai Style" writers, we should start with these types of people.</p>
<p>What are the methods to eliminate them? It's hard to say what the active methods are, but passive methods are easy to implement:</p>
<p>(1) Self-respecting publishers (including newspapers, magazines, and bookstores) should refuse to publish their work;</p>
<p>(2) Self-respecting writers should refuse to cooperate with them (such as if they run a publication and invite you to be a special contributor, or if they run a school and invite you to be an honorary professor, etc.);</p>
<p>(3) Self-respecting young people should not be kept by them, not be used by them, not write, compile, or translate for them, and not be accomplices. In this way, these "Shanghai Style" writers can slowly disappear. They will understand that the cultural world is not something that can be bought and sold empty-handed. They will embark on the path they should take || becoming officials or doing business || and will not continue to cause trouble in the cultural and writing circles, causing the entire Shanghai New Cultural scene to be tainted with an impure name.</p>
<h3>New Year's Eve</h3>
<p>— Bai Yan</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, New Year's Eve is approaching again.</p>
<p>In a foreign land, I always feel a surge of emotions during festivals; the distant dreams of my childhood cannot help but float to the surface of my mind.</p>
<p>In my childhood, how I loved New Year's Eve! At that time, I could wear new clothes, I could play with firecrackers, and I could feast on delicious food. Moreover, even if I made minor mistakes, my mother would not punish me harshly...</p>
<p>However, during my tenth year, that New Year's Eve left me with an impression that was quite difficult to forget.</p>
<p>That day, Uncle Yong (my father's friend) came to our house very early. My father had him sit down in the study. Not long after, my father went out on business. Only he was left alone in the room. Sometimes, my mother would occasionally enter the room to talk to him for a few sentences, but he would answer in such a shy and quiet voice. I snuggled beside my mother, curiously watching him, because he was not usually like this. Why was he distressed when people felt joy during the New Year? After leaving the room, I whispered to my mother.</p>
<p>(Mom! Why is Uncle Yong hiding alone in the room?)</p>
<p>(He's playing 'Emperor' (Note 1)!) My mother said softly.</p>
<p>However, I still couldn't understand my mother's answer. I just secretly peered at him through the crack in the window.</p>
<p>In the room, he just wandered around aimlessly, and sometimes he would sit down quietly, looking very distressed with his brows furrowed. He would sigh softly from time to time.</p>
<p>All day long, he just locked himself inside the walls.</p>
<p>It wasn't until it was time to light the lamps that he quietly slipped out the door.</p>
<p>At that time, I didn't understand anything about the flavor of life. I just observed everything with surprised eyes. As I grew older, I realized that New Year's Eve was just a New Year's Eve for the rich; for the poor, it was another "hurdle"!</p>
<p>(Note 1) "Emperor" is a refined term used in Huizhou for someone evading debts.</p>
<h3>Final Reply Regarding Realistic Novels and First-Person Perspective</h3>
<p>— Mu Mutian</p>
<p>Because of the issue of "realistic novels and the first-person perspective," I had some tangential debates with Mr. Chen Ye. Mr. Chen, grasping at shadows and indulging in high-flown rhetoric, strayed further and further from the point. It's best to conclude this.</p>
<p>My motive for raising that question was that, after reading "Literary Arts," I saw several works by young people inappropriately and lazily using the first-person perspective. To correct this, I wrote that article "On Realistic Novels and the First-Person Perspective."</p>
<p>My conclusion is that realistic novels must have their unique style. Literary styles are time-bound. Realistic novels must have their fundamental style, which occupies the dominant position. However, old styles can continue their remaining life to a certain extent. New content can be put into old styles, but the old style cannot become the dominant style. Therefore, realistic novels should mainly use the third-person perspective. But that does not prohibit the occasional use of the first-person perspective. However, using the first-person perspective to express large subjects, broad and complex realities, is prone to problems no matter how well it is controlled. For example, in "Germinal" (by Émile Zola), it would be difficult to write so thoroughly, no matter which character is used for self-narration. If Mr. Chen wants me to give examples of new realism, then "The Rout" (by Alexander Fadeyev) is a good example. Also, works like "Water Margin" naturally cannot be handled using the first-person perspective. However, in short works with simple subjects, in appropriate situations, the first-person perspective can still be used. But this is limited to a very narrow scope, like "Hunger" (by Knut Hamsun) and so on. But that cannot become the basic style of realism. It is not permissible to regard it as equivalent to the third-person perspective.</p>
<p>In China today, using workers and peasants as protagonists makes the first-person perspective even more difficult to use appropriately. If workers and peasants were to write themselves, it would probably not become a work of art, because Chinese workers and peasants are mostly illiterate. If intellectuals were to write their confessions, the emotions and tone would be very difficult to make authentic. Therefore, in China today, the first-person perspective will again be limited to an extremely narrow scope. But this does not mean that works depicting the lives of workers and peasants cannot be produced in China today.</p>
<p>The above is my conclusion. Let me further analyze Mr. Chen's mistakes. Mr. Chen's spirit of debate is admirable. However, those points of negligence should be overcome.</p>
<p>(1) Mr. Chen has consistently engaged in abstract and empty talk. He has not engaged in practical discussions based on works. He thinks "Yang Ma's Diary" is acceptable. In fact, everyone knows it goes against reality that an old nanny can write such elegant diaries. He says: "Use the first-person perspective when it is appropriate," but he did not indicate which work has used it appropriately.</p>
<p>(2) Mr. Chen distortingly and one-sidedly uses his materials. He categorically affirms that Gorky is a "great realist" while obscuring Gorky's romantic side. He quotes Flaubert's criticism of Zola: "He writes the language of hooligans when writing about hooligans," and misattributes it by saying: "This is the classic that authors must read when producing realistic novels in the first-person perspective." He forgot that "objectivity" and "detachment" were the creeds of 19th-century realism. Which of the "Rougon-Macquart" novels is written in the first-person perspective? This is what I want to ask.</p>
<p>(3) Mr. Chen specializes in distorting other people's arguments and subjectively and arbitrarily developing them. I said: "In China today, where culture is backward, writing novels about workers and peasants in the first-person perspective is more likely to become farcical." But Mr. Chen has distorted it to mean that novels about workers and peasants cannot be produced in China today. Such deliberate distortion, followed by a deceitful rebuttal, is truly "Pigsy filing a complaint against the plaintiff." I think this kind of "debate policy" is not good.</p>
<p>(4) Although old realism and new realism have differences, they also have their similarities. Mr. Chen has again understood this point one-sidedly. Although the two are based on different worldviews, they are the same in demanding "truthfulness." The characters portrayed must be living, real people, which is their common requirement.</p>
<p>(5) Mr. Chen mechanically separates content and form. He even more mechanically believes that not using the first-person perspective means being in the position of an outsider. We have always affirmed the consistency of content and form. One cannot explore form without connecting it to content. Mr. Chen has not yet understood this point! It is not that using the first-person perspective in a novel can make the author inseparable from the masses they are writing about. "The Rout" is a practical example. Isn't "Yang Ma's Diary" the same?</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Chen has misunderstood the truthfulness of literature. Perhaps my wording was flawed on this point. Naturally, I am opposed to writing realism as simply listing and piling up. Realism wants to express all aspects of reality and their relationships, which is undoubtedly the case.</p>
<p>Let this issue end here. Originally, I thought that in principle, I didn't have much difference with Mr. Chen. There was originally a long reply, but the editor of "Free Talk" asked me to shorten it due to space constraints. Therefore, it has only now been abridged into this piece.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Discussions on this issue will end here. Future submissions from either party will generally not be published.</p>
<h3>I Curse Your Smile (3)</h3>
<p>— Wu Yan</p>
<p>One day, he came to our store to buy something, saying the name (Jie Wu) in Burmese. He assumed that people living in Burma would understand Burmese. Immediately seeing that everyone was confused, he made a circle with his thumb and index finger, and said again:</p>
<p>(Jie Wu, Jie Wu...)</p>
<p>The two diplomatic talents in our store, the proprietress and her eldest daughter, painstakingly tried to guess what (Jie Wu) meant.</p>
<p>(Mango?)</p>
<p>The proprietress thought that every time he came to the store, he would always buy some of the newly picked fruit, so she said that. Then she pointed to the mango tree outside the door, to see which fruit the Indian wanted.</p>
<p>The Indian shook his head, his face flushed, and he became anxious.</p>
<p>(Jie Wu, Jie Wu...)</p>
<p>He said repeatedly, spitting out each syllable, making a circle with his hand. However, the Foreign Minister proprietress also failed. Who could guess it?</p>
<p>(I know, I know.)</p>
<p>The daughter, who assisted her mother, suddenly exclaimed, and ran into the kitchen, her wooden clogs clapping loudly. She happily carried out a bamboo basket of potatoes, and ran out clapping again, holding it high in front of the Indian, almost touching his brown nose. She excitedly said:</p>
<p>(Is it, is it, is it... you dumb person!)</p>
<p>But the Indian was still shaking his chin, but his face was even redder, smiling unnaturally, wanting to say something, but unable to, very anxious.</p>
<p>Thinking she had guessed correctly, but the result was still wrong, she was exceptionally disappointed. The bamboo basket softly drooped down, she pursed her lips, and cursed fiercely at the Indian:</p>
<p>(You're going to die! Indian devil!)</p>
<p>Naturally he didn't understand, but he understood that he was being cursed, and showed a very sad expression.</p>
<p>(Don't listen to his nonsense!)</p>
<p>The proprietress saw that the business that had already come to the door could not be done, sighed, and sat on the side, opening the black cloth of her chest, pulling out her nipple, stuffing it in her child's mouth, gently rocking.</p>
<p>This Indian, trapped in a desperate situation, turned into a mute, suddenly became clever, slightly bent down, squatted on the ground, stretched out his arms, flapping them like a bird, making this sound with his mouth.</p>

<h3>Chronicle of Events</h3>
<p>— Yi Ping</p>
<p>After all, we are Chinese. After the Gregorian New Year, there is also the Lunar New Year (or the Abolished Calendar New Year). Friends who write articles naturally write timely articles whenever they can. After the Gregorian New Year, they write a "New Year's Trial Pen." For the Lunar New Year, they come up with "New Year's Greetings, Success in Everything." But my heart is pounding, and I stop breathing for a few seconds when I hear the doorbell ring. It was like that during the Gregorian New Year, and it's still like that now that the Lunar New Year is coming. But I have to write, just like I have to eat, precisely because writing articles = (equals) eating. So I picked up my pen and wrote the three words "Chronicle of Events." Then I thought that doing this kind of "archaeological" work is thankless. Collecting evidence of the Minbian rebellion, or the bustling return of a certain important person, if I'm not reading the newspaper while sitting on the toilet, there's definitely no need for me to nag again. But my personal big events, like borrowing money, being scolded, etc., seem like "family scandals should not be aired." Looking at the weeping red candle, I really can't think of any big events worth recording. But when I wrote the title, it seemed like there were many big events to record, so I lit a cigarette. Even if I'm squeezing oil from a stone, I have to write some things that I consider to be "big." After all, I'm a smart person. I remembered that the bosses of the cigarette companies, understanding that writers don't have stimulants to squeeze their blood when writing, manufactured so many cigarettes, the magnificent Navy Cut, the perfect My Dear, Wang Dao, White Dragon, Old Gun, British Brand. To thank them for their kindness, I think the first item to be included in the Chronicle of Events is...</p>
<p>On a certain day of a certain month, the Huacheng Tobacco Company placed full-page ads in Shen and Xin newspapers, Beautiful brand reduced sales by 40 cents per tin, and 10 cents per pack.</p>
<p>The lottery tickets of Shen Dacheng had universal gifts such as meat noodles and fish noodles, and the one customer of the Sanyou Industrial Society (that is our in-laws) can be regarded as the pioneer of this year's advertising.</p>
<p>Audel Pierre arrived in China and was "enchanted by Chinese women (for several days)." (Here I can give a thumbs up and say that my wife is a "Chinese woman.")</p>
<p>Domestic films inexplicably (changed) (an exception to the exception), foreign films greatly (reversed). (an exception to the exception)</p>
<p>A certain pharmacy on Mintini Yin Road hangs a sign saying "(Ruyi X Great Sale, selling for 20 cents each)."</p>
<p>Haikingbo arrived in India fully loaded.</p>
<p>This summer, the number of women with exposed ankles increased by one-half compared to last year, and rouge changed to turmeric.</p>
<p>Mei Lanfang and Li Guichun unprecedentedly collaborated on a new play, "Five Iron Duke Ties," also known as the Beijing-Shanghai Struggle.</p>
<p>The Great World had two visits from strange people. The Great Thousand World had one visit from a magic master.</p>
<p>Falsely claiming to be kidnapped is this year's new method for avoiding debt.</p>
<p>The Nine Stars Theater performs hula dances and other physical performances once a week.</p>
<p>Two new hotels opened, three large cinemas, countless Chinese medicine shops, and countless banks.</p>
<p>New film queen Chen Yumei, Emperor Wildcat married.</p>
<p>There are more than 100,000 radios in Shanghai. The sales of lullaby records reached more than 20,000.</p>
<p>The comedian Wu Neng passed away.</p>
<p>Two major assassination cases occurred.</p>
<p>A sex-related suicide case was discovered.</p>
<p>Rue Joffre was renamed Mysterious Street.</p>
<p>In this year, the rural economy collapsed. Chronicle of Events finished, farewell to the pen!</p>
<p>With the sound of firecrackers, we bid farewell to the old,</p>
<p>Peach charms bring renewal to all things.</p>
<p>Note: The above are all calculated according to the abolished calendar.</p>
<h3>"(High Hats)" and "(Entryway Smiles)"</h3>
<p>— Tong Zi</p>
<p>In today's society, if you want to make a living, and you go to relatives and friends for help, you always have to prepare some gifts to show respect. These respectful things are called "(Entryway Smiles)."</p>
<p>Judging from the name of these three words "(Entryway Smiles)", we can know the importance of this thing: with an entryway, you can buy people's smiles, which is a good sign (?). So, if we want to find something to do, we have to ask relatives and friends, we must be cautious, and spare no sacrifice or cost to buy people's smiles. You must know that without an entryway, people will not smile, and if they don't smile, it's not good?</p>
<p>But, people always come out to find food to eat because they are poor, and they go to beg relatives and friends in order to find food to eat; the reason for bowing their heads and asking people for help is nothing more than wanting to get something done, a little bit of money. Before things have been accomplished, they have to spend a sum of money, isn't this worrying?</p>
<p>Moreover, "(Entryway Smiles)" are not something that can be done carelessly. If used properly, it is auspicious, if used improperly, it is ominous. The things you give to people must be to their liking, at least they must be generous and appropriate; otherwise, if you offend people and embarrass them, then not only will you not be able to buy a smile, but you may also provoke them to be unkind?</p>
<p>Therefore, "(Entryway Smiles)" are simply a stepping stone to seeking things, and also a head-on blow to seeking things.</p>
<p>I think: people always like "(compliments)", and respectful gifts are nothing more than "(compliments)"; if the "(compliment)" is good, you can get a smile. But, the "(compliment)" of a gift, first, must be affordable, and second, it must be agreeable to the recipient; if it is unaffordable, you cannot "(compliment)" people, and if it is not agreeable to the recipient, it cannot be a "(compliment)". Given these many difficulties, it is better to use "(high hats)", which are simpler and more economical.</p>
<p>The original title of "(High Hats)" is "(flattery)", also known as "(bootlicking)". Our belly is the main camp of this thing. We can use our tongue as a visiting card for gift-giving. This kind of "(entryway smile)" that does not cost money is inexhaustible. If we want to ask someone for help, it doesn't matter if we can't afford a gift, as long as we give him a "(high hat)".</p>
<p>Everyone likes to wear "(high hats)", there is absolutely no reason why they wouldn't like them! As long as we send one, two, three, four, five, or six hats, are we still afraid that people won't smile?</p>
