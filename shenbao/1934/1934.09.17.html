<p>國聯與蘇俄正式換文</p>
<p>合作維持世界和平</p>
<p>三十四國代表電邀蘇俄加盟</p>
<p>李維諾夫數小時内覆電贊同</p>
<p>理事之爭我將落選耶</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　蘇俄巳正式接受加入國聯、今夜日内瓦之注意點遂集中於明日行政院非常任理事三席之改選、據消息靈通方面所稱、西班牙决可連任、智利繼任巴拿馬亦無問題、惟中國能否得三分之二之多數尙不可必、故現在中國之理事一席或有轉讓土耳其之可能、再、國聯方面亦靜候瑞士代表摩泰對於蘇俄之攻擊、大槪明日摩泰卽將發言、惟無論春所言如何、將不能影響大會於星期二三正式投票通過蘇俄入會也、（十六日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　蘇俄今日正式接受邀請加入國際聯盟、請書簽字者約三十五國、該項請書電致莫斯科後、不數小時卽經蘇俄政府覆電接受、國聯行政院中祗阿根廷·葡萄牙·及巴拿馬三國未曾投票、法國外長巴爾都稱、三國並未聲明反對、故此事實係一致通過、行政院亦巳通過、蘇俄爲常任事事、波蘭之反對竟未實現、大槪蘇俄將於星期二三丄式加入國聯、並卽行開始實行國聯會員職務、按蘇俄參加國聯並無條件、因早巳聲明、未入國聯以前之爭端一槪不交海牙國際法庭公斷、惟以後如有爭端則將照辦、若干方面表示、蘇俄久被視爲國際間之「頑童」、此次加入國聯對於將來之世界和平大有影響、卽以遠東而論、日俄關係時告緊張、蘇俄今茲加入國聯、其地位將大爲增强、西邊對德亦然、政界方面更預　、德國波蘭苟不加入擬議中之東歐七國互助公約、則法俄兩國之防守　事同盟一月内卽可成立云、（十五日國民電）</p>
<p>國聯蘇俄換文内容</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　邀蘇俄入盟之請書經三十國簽字、於昨日下午二時發與寄寓日内瓦附近之蘇俄外長李維諾夫、電文内容如下、「南菲聯邦·阿爾巴尼亞·澳大利亞自治聯邦·奥地利·大不利顚·保加利亞·加拿大·智利·中國·西班牙·愛斯多尼亞·埃幾活比·法蘭西·希臘·海地·匈牙利·印度·伊拉克·意大利·立陶宛·拉達維亞·墨西哥·紐絲蘭·波斯·波蘭·羅馬尼亞·捷克斯拉夫·土耳其·烏拉圭·南斯拉夫·等國出席第十五屆國聯大會之代表、鑒於國聯會主要之使命爲維持與締造和平、而此種使命、有需於一切國家普遍之合作、是以邀請蘇維埃聯邦共和國加入國聯會、並請其予國聯以可貴之合作、」</p>
<p>上述邀請電文當卽遞致國聯會大會主席瑞典外長散特婁、</p>
<p>蘇聯外委李維諾夫致大會主席之復文如下、</p>
<p>「蘇聯政府業巳接到國聯會多數會員國簽署之電文、内開國聯會之使命在締造和平、此項使命有需於一切國家普遍之合作、簽名各國因此邀請蘇聯政府加入國聯會云云、蘇聯政府接獲丹麥·芬蘭·瑞典·挪威·四國政府正式通知、各該國家對於蘇聯加盟一舉俱表善意之態度、查蘇聯政府對於締造與鞏固和平原視爲外交政策之主要部分、凡爲和平利益而主張國際合作者蘇俄向未漠然置之、現所接到之邀請書係由國聯會多數會員國所發出、充分表示國聯會眞實愛好和平之志願、並可證明國聯會確巳承認有與蘇維埃政府合作之必要、是以蘇聯政府準備接受該邀請書、成爲國聯會之一會員國、而在國聯會中取得其應有之地位、並聲明按照國聯會盟約第一條規定遵守一切義務及一切有拘束會員國性質之决議案、抑國聯會盟約各方欲加以修改、俾與凱洛克非戰公約相調和、並使國際戰爭完全擯諸法律之外、蘇俄入盟適當修改盟約問題正在考慮之時、此則蘇聯所尤欣幸者也、又鑒於國聯會盟約第十二·十三·兩條旣巳規定凡會員國間發生爭議、勢將决裂時、須將此事提交公斷、或法律裁判、蘇聯政府以爲宜於此時期預先聲明、凡蘇聯加入國聯會以前發生之爭議不能適用此項手續、余謹希望全體會員國秉國際合作與維持和平之誠意接受此項宣言、」</p>
<p>蘇俄加盟換文之後另列一附件、卽爲瑞典首席代表散特婁以斯干的那維亞四國之名義致國聯會行政院主席捷克外長貝奈斯之一函、内稱、各該國以通常外交手續、向蘇俄政府證明各國對於蘇俄入盟投票贊成、但又稱、「如國聯會大會以該會名義邀請蘇俄加盟、則斯干的那維亞四國代表團均經奉命一致參加、茲特聲明之、」此函由散特婁署名、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>國聯紀錄新史一頁</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　國聯今日紀錄其近今歷史上最重要成績之一、蓋蘇俄已熱切接收加入國聯之請書也、請書共有兩份、一由國聯會員三十國簽名、另一份爲斯坎狄那維亞半島四國簽名、内謂、四國政府今直接通告莫斯科、彼等願贊助蘇俄加入國聯云、國聯行政院今晚將舉行會議、俾確認上屆會議以常任理事席予蘇俄之非正式决議、阿眞廷·葡萄牙·巴拿馬三國當時雖皆未投票、但此不足更變贊成之一致也、</p>
<p>蘇俄外委李維諾夫巳接受加入國聯之覆書、内稱、蘇俄政府願依照國聯盟約之第一條擔任遵守一切國際義務、及約束會員國之一切决議、當此國聯行將考慮修正盟約而使脗合白里安凱波格非戰公約及完全排斥國際戰爭問題之際、蘇俄得加入國聯尤所欣慰者也、國聯盟約第十二與第十三條旣容各國以爭案提交仲裁或司法解决、蘇俄政府以爲今宜明白表示其意見、凡此手續不應施於在蘇俄加入國聯以前所發生各問題之衝突云、</p>
<p>蘇俄之接受國聯請書、實爲法國外交之勝利、法國近當努力拉攏蘇俄贊助東歐安全公約之計劃、</p>
<p>蘇俄加入國聯後、國聯會員將增至五十八國、德日兩國仍列於内、因彼等退出國聯之照會、須滿兩年始發生效力也、各國之未加入國聯者、今尙餘美國、巴西·埃及·阿富汗·柯斯太里加·及愛瓜多六國、</p>
<p>國聯行政院常任理事原爲五席、蘇俄加入後將爲六席、於是行政院理事共有十六席、</p>
<p>英國自治地、除愛爾蘭自由邦外、皆簽名於邀請蘇俄加入國聯請書、歐洲國之未簽名者爲比利時·荷蘭·葡萄牙·盧森堡·及瑞士五國、</p>
<p>蘇俄政府之申請加入國聯文將於星期一日提交主席團、一切手續可於星期二晚辦竣、（十五日路透電）</p>
<p>理事一席俄亦穩得</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　國際聯合會行政院頃巳通過决議案、一俟蘇聯加入國聯經國聯大會通過後、卽以行政院常任理事一席畀與蘇聯、决議案内並規定、建議大會核准此項决定云、此項决議案表决時、行政院内十國代表投贊成票、此外葡萄牙·巴拿馬·及阿根廷三國則放棄投票、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　邀請蘇聯加入國聯之請書巳獲得三分之二以上會員國之簽名、因此可認爲蘇聯業巳成國聯之一部分、本日行政院開會時、主席捷克外長貝奈斯宣讀蘇聯之覆文草稿後、卽提出予蘇聯以常任理事一席之决議案、並正式唱名表决、行政院原有理事計十五國、除日本德國巳退出外、十國代表表示贊成、其餘巴拿馬·葡萄牙·及阿根廷一國則聲明放棄投票、此三國中惟葡萄牙代表外長達馬泰發言、說明該國態度、謂葡萄牙對於政行院多數所决定之政策不欲投票反對、但在大會投票表决蘇聯加入問題時、葡萄牙擬投反對票云、又巴拿馬放棄投票則殊出意外、蓋上次行政院舉行秘密會議時、巴拿馬曾參加贊成蘇聯加入各國所發表之紳士恊定、據該國代表宣稱、彼閱日内瓦報紙所揭載之論文後、方主張回復原來决定、不投贊成票云、行政院表决以後、大會主席散特婁宣稱、彼將於星期一日上午十時召集大會主席團會議、於十一時召開大會、將蘇聯加入國聯一案列入是日議程、而由大會决定、將該案交付第六委員會審查後、向大會提出報告、大約第六委員會可於星期二日上午開會、俾於午後向大會提出報告、報告提出後、大會卽可正式投票通過矣、如此項程序依常規進行、則大會可於星期三日上午舉行鄭重之會議、招待蘇聯代表團正式參加、此舉當爲目前世界之一重大事件焉、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　法國外長巴爾都今晨接得蘇聯外交委員李維諾夫一函、略謂昨日國聯行政院通過决議案、於蘇聯加入國聯後、與以常任理事一席、此事成功、賴巴爾都斡旋之力爲多、故特專函伸謝云、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>歐洲佛敎大會</p>
<p>（倫敦）　第一屆歐洲佛敎大會將於下星期杪在倫敦萊琴公園舉行、由德國佛敎僧人道空（譯音）出席、英國著名作家蕭伯納·威爾斯·及其他名流均被邀請出席、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>中東路貨車</p>
<p>在一面坡傾覆</p>
<p>又遭義軍襲擊</p>
<p>（哈爾濱）　今日上午八時十五分、中東路東部線一面坡與葦河間、往東開貨車之前驅車、因一部路軌被義軍破壞、致該前驅車脫軌顚覆、隨後駛行之貨物列車、被潛伏附近之義軍射擊、警衛之、「滿國」軍立卽應戰、交戰約一小時、義軍始四散敗逃、故貨物列車得免掠奪、前赴一面坡、）十六日電通電）</p>

<h3 id="c1">日本統制僞滿經濟 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>敬</p>
<p>日本統制僞滿經濟的全部。巳經倡了兩三年。其所有未曾實行的原因一爲他自巳内部矛盾没有解决。如外交拓務軍部三者的鼎足對立換言之就是財閥官僚軍閥之間。還有許多隔閡。不能順利進行。二則因國際間的制限和我們中國抵抗的問題。還有相當的牽制。使他不能不有點顧忌現在日本自身的矛盾—財閥官僚。軍閥間的不調和。巳漸見减低。所謂二位一體的統治。有了實施的可能。政治上的難局可望打開。同時國際間問題也力圖緩和所以他要着手於經濟統制了。</p>
<p>日本實行統制「滿洲」經濟之前。又有一件小小的事實是蒐集鐡屑和購進製鐡原料。這件事情。在表面上似乎是不值什麽。但我們試細按其内容就曉得。這裏含有極深遠的意義。因爲日本雖昭示其國民。說日本的鋼鐡巳能自給自足。其國内所産。差不多有了兩百三十萬噸。但是事實上鋼鐡的原料。大部分都仰仗於馬萊半島等處外來的供給。在平常時期這還没有什麽大問題。一到戰時。卽有杜絶之虞。日本在此非常時期。極力擴張軍需工業鋼鐡的需要。當然非常之多。則此次之蒐集鋼鐡原料。不是含有深遠的意義嗎　　日本統制僞滿經濟一事。就此極小之一點看。就可明白其將來的動向何如。就大陸方面言。與東三省邊境緊接。而經濟利益又很尖銳對立着的第就是蘇聯。在思想上給與日本一般社會的影響。巳使日本感到非常不安。而又無法徹底驅逐。且在歷史上又有仇隙。所以日本的陸軍。不得不向蘇聯嚴密警戒。而蘇聯在第一次五年計劃中。卽巳充分注意遠東的防衛現在對於軍事。自然設備更嚴。而其外交手腕。又甚敏妙。加入國聯成功而後。在國際方面。巳占優勢。日本於此。雖高揭着對蘇的大旗。但决不肯隨便動手於是在不肯隨便動手之中。就用着這第一步統制僞滿經濟的方法來了。這種統制政策。其所得的實際利益。比向西比利亞進兵大。而其所損失則甚小也。</p>
<p>我們由此就聯想到民國二十年的夏天。日本令俄國通内田康哉去作南滿鐡道總裁。命陸軍前輩。以軍人而兼政治家的字垣一成去作朝鮮總督。任這一文一武。去籌劃九一八事變。如何取得東三省。如何對付蘇聯惜當時我們没有看出先機。以致完全處於被動地位。任人擺佈。現在日本所謂大陸政策。仍念念不忘。僞滿改制以後。進行統制「滿洲」經濟。雖含有對蘇意味然而决不止於僅僅對蘇。此我們今日所亟應看明的。</p>

<h3 id="c3">英國經濟形勢一瞥（英國通信） <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>預算出入相抵有餘</p>
<p>失業人數逐漸增加</p>
<p>英國也是在一種變相的非常時期、我們知道英國的政治結構、爲世界上最民主的國家、議會政治運用、最爲敏活、一般人民、瞭解政治意義、也很深切、雖然多數人民、趨於穩健保守、但也不肯違背世界潮流而開倒車、所以自一九二九年美國發生了經濟狂潮以後、英國就先捨棄了世界金融的王座、實行停止金本位制度、求國内經濟的穩定、自自治領·殖民地·與英國本國間的經濟平衡、渥大華英帝國經濟會議而後、這種傾向、更見濃厚、而漸漸離開民主政治逢由主義的情形、也愈見顯明、</p>
<p>現時的英國政治、確是空前所未有的「全國一致、」從前那種兩大黨更替當政的事實、巳不再見了、而以恊同内閣共同運用國政、以以圖克服當前的經濟恐慌、彌縫政治上的罅隙、使各自治領·殖民地·的離心運動、不致脫離軌道、使外交上的矛盾、不太過於擴大、這是很爲努力的、總之英國今日在國内要保持現狀、在遠東要應付日本、在中亞要與蘇聯周旋、并要鞏固波斯油田和印度的統治、不要使法蘭西在歐洲過於强大、致損英國權威、此英國最大之懷抱也、</p>
<p>這些事的實效何如、我們可從財政上觀察、英國自一九三四年到一九三五年度預算、支出方面、計六萬九千八百萬鎊、而收入方面、則有七萬二千七百萬鎊、收支相抵、收入超過二千九百萬鎊、這是值得注意的、去年以來、世界主要各國、莫不閙財政收支不平衡的恐慌、英國能有這樣效果、不能不說是政治技術的努力、與全國一致内閣的功績、且此七萬二千九百萬鎊國庫收入之中、有六萬八千八百萬鎊、多是租稅收入、非租稅收入、不過三千九百萬鎊、這三千九百鎊之中、并不曾包含得有公債收入、因爲近來英國財政界、很明白發行公債、結果並不於國庫有利的、</p>
<p>所以現在的英國、竭力增加租稅、我們記得在大戰時一九一四年度英國的租稅收入、不過一萬七千萬鎊、現時却增加了四倍、由此種租稅增加的情形、我們又可窺知英國自由主義的資本主義組織、巳漸次改變、國家主義旣鮮明以後、則統制經濟的意味、也自然顯現出來了、</p>
<p>英國一般的經濟狀况、據「經濟雜誌」的記載、其批發物價指數、以一九三一年九月爲基準、則今年五月爲一○八·三、六月爲一○八·一、七月爲一○九·五、巳漸見上漲、趨於穩定的途徑、不過今年商船的噸數、比去年六月却减少了四十多萬噸、但這是世界經濟恐慌的影響、英國總算是比較好的了、</p>
<p>社會一般景象、還看不出怎樣好轉的象徵、便如失業人數、從今年一月以後、卽漸次向下减低、似乎是轉佳的傾向、但是到了六月間、失業登記的人數、又增加起來了、六月比五月增加了二萬七千人、合計失業者、有二百十二萬四千人、其所以增加的原因、是炭鑛勞工失業者增加了六萬五千人、毛織工業增加人數一萬二千、裁縫工人失業增加了九千、其餘各業、則多有雇用、因此有人說、這是一種季節關係、并不足以據作英國事業頽敗的判斷、</p>
<p>今年春季以後、經濟界確表現着頽落的情况、但是到了六月、其産業活動指數、（以一九二四年爲基準）卽由四月的一０七·七、漲到一一０·二了、這是一九三０年以來的最高指數、但是否有恒久性、確屬疑問、以失業人數的增加來看、也未能過於樂觀、（八月九日於倫敦）</p>

<p>來滬已兩逢九一八</p>
<p>大通社記者、首叩李氏以對九一八紀念日之感想、李氏答謂、予自繞道俄境返國、於此身經之慘痛紀念日、連同本年、則已虚度二屆、遠矚近瞻、與日俱非、故身雖覊滬、而精神寄托、仍在關外、於悼痛之外、實無所謂感想、</p>
<p>義軍就義不勝枚舉</p>
<p>記者復叩以李東海等四十餘人、在哈爾濱就義、當時就義情形、得報告否、李氏答謂、關於義軍就義之事、無時無之、如李東海等不過其一而巳、蓋敵僞之痛恨義勇軍、固在意中、其對智識階級、尤不肯放鬆、多被羅織入罪寃死者比比、</p>
<p>三千萬民不忘中國</p>
<p>李氏續謂、敵僞自强繳東三省民衆自衛武器以來、如遼寗各屬、巳全數繳出、次如黑龍江·亦被繳去大部、惟吉林所屬、則繳出尙屬少數、當其被繳時、均非所願、故激起民變之事、屢見不一見、總之、目下東北三千六百萬民衆、知有中國、不知有僞國者、當在三千萬以上云、</p>

<p>何不南返</p>
<p>内蒙自治、自辦理於茲、巳具相當成績、各王公對中央均能竭誠合作、故今後各事之進行、必極順利、而收效之宏、將蒸蒸日上、何應欽長官、最近無請假南返意、因華北公務繁忙、不獲分身南返也、黄氏擬在滬作數日勾留、卽行入京</p>

<p>昨晨復降大雨</p>
<p>低窪處成澤國</p>
<p>近數日來、本市天氣、突轉陰霾、連日降雨、自前日晨起、大雨傾盆、終日不止、昨日復降暴雨、交通被阻、農産損失、巳屬不貲、至昨日上午九時許、始雨止日出、然天氣突轉悶熱、且仍時降微雨、茲將調查所得、分誌如下、</p>
<p>昨晨暴雨</p>
<p>前日終日降下暴雨、迄深晚始止、幸未發大風、故江水尙未上岸、但馬路積水盈尺、交通受阻、至昨晨五時許、積水尙未退盡之時、雷聲隆隆、復降暴雨頗久、因此馬路積水高漲、店舖損失甚大、至八時許始止、</p>
<p>盡成澤國</p>
<p>大白社記者昨日驅車前往閘北等處調查、閘北大統路交通路太陽廟一段、及第三平民住所附近、積水盈尺、幾成澤國、共和路、虬江路·亦皆一片汪洋、沿馬路店舖内、亦多被水浸入損失不少、南市城區肇嘉路·小南門·及新開河·等較低窪之處、多因雨水一時不及流出、積水尺餘、惟新開河等處雨止水即退盡、其他閘北較低窪之處積水、至昨晚尙未退盡、</p>
<p>交通受阻</p>
<p>凡低窪之處、因積水盈尺、行人除赤足入水而行外、多雇黄包車代步、故黄包車夫、無不利市三倍、三馬路之電氣方棚、因被雨水浸入受損、三馬路一帶之電話、亦均不通、至下午修竣恢復、其他彭浦·眞如·吳淞·江灣·等區之電話、昨均不通、至昨晚尙未完全修復、</p>
<p>農産損失</p>
<p>值此·正在秋收·及下種之時、農産受此暴雨、損失甚鉅、正在收穫之早稻、及棉花荳等、數日天雨、田中積水、均有腐爛之虞、方在下種之蔬菜、被暴雨猛冲、多未能發芽、故農民無不呌苦、</p>
<p>天氣悶熱</p>
<p>昨日上午九時許起、雨止天晴、陽光照射、天氣突然轉悶熱、然仍時降微雨、似有續降暴雨之景象、</p>
<p>一片汪洋</p>
<p>南市南車站一帶、因地勢較低、而地下溝渠之建築、又欠完備、故每逢大雨、瀉水輒感不暢、日來連宵大雨、黄浦江水位大增、致江水倒灌溝渠、因之南車站一帶兩旁、積水成渠、地方法院、及國貨路、新普育堂内草地上、因地勢更爲低窪、積水深達半呎、一片汪洋·行人出進、都藉車輛、所以人力車生意無形中增收數倍、故預料今日天能晴霽、則積水於夜午可退去、</p>

<p>熊聞聲、卽離床啟門、一見兩人、素不相識、正欲啟口相詢時、詎兩暴徒之一、卽突出手槍、向熊連發三槍、因近在咫尺、故完全命中、暴徒見目的巳達、卽倉皇奔逃下樓、出門逃逸無踪、</p>
<p>一息僅存</p>
<p>熊中彈倒地後、鮮血直流、同時該館茶房等均一齊趕到、但熊除呼「茶房快一點」一語外、卽倒地不省人事、急由賬房用電話報告捕房、捕頭立派中西包探趕到、細察熊所中三槍、一在嘴部、一在左頸根、一在右胸、當卽喚到救護車將熊車送仁濟醫院、但巳一息僅存、</p>

<p>（二）保留登記</p>
<p>本部因看了有好多讀者在本部登記了，以後並不見來同我們討論什麽，因此覺得，旣無誠意讀書，又何必空掛名目呢？於是，不得不而將幾位朋友的登記取銷了。現在，我們没接到他們來信的聲明、要們不寫信是生活忙得無讀書寫信的時間，或者老闆故意干涉他們通信，因此，「心中却得甚是慚愧，旣没讀書，問什麽呢？」所以久不通信，但他們一致的要求，要我們仍保留登記，他們在萬忙中，仍想我們能「指導」他們，有一個備「生活顧問」的機會，我們自然願意接受這項請求，但希望凡處如此境遇的讀者，仍請利用萬分之幾的閑暇，一個月隨便寫幾個字通知我們，我們不獨歡迎這樣勤奮的讀者通信，並且還願接待這樣朋友們談話。（不過，請先期函約）</p>

<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第二回　作賣入民間路回永壽别家來天上人到長安</p>
<p>張介夫首先覺得他的話有些不妥當，便道：我的意思，是說這地方，人民這樣的苦，你的感想怎樣呢？李士廉道：俗言道得好；民情似鐡，官法如爐，天下没有炸不出油的豆子。以前我不大相信這話，現在我明白了。那科長聽他說來說去，總不外乎徵收機關裏面的事情，便笑道：李先生一向都辦稅務吧？眞可以說是三句話不離本行的了。李士廉這才發現了自己說話不留神，巳是被人看出破綻來，臉上紅着一陣，也就强笑了一聲，不敢再說什麽了。有了這一點趣談，這就不便將這個破莊子再行討論，汽車夫上好了水，也把車子修理好了，大家坐上去，繼續的開着向前走。在没有到過此地的，大家心裏都不免想着，周文王築路，到現在巳是二千多年了。照理，這裏的樹木森森，應該賽過那些漢柏唐槐才是。再說，這樣偉大的帝王；他的陵墓，一定也是山川明媚的所在，都眼巴巴的向車子外望着，對那古代的勝蹟，以要先覩爲快。不想車子跑上了一片高原，在白日頭底下，只見茫茫的黄土地皮，漸漸的向上，直至老遠，與天相接。在這中間，有些其高如屋的土堆，或者孤另另的一個，或是三五個擠在一處，顯然是人工堆砌起來的，却猜不着這是什麽用途。張介夫道：這是墳墓嗎？怎麽這樣子大呢？李士廉自己曾失言了，不敢再答話，怕是又弄出了笑話。車子裏另外兩個人，好像另成了個組織，他們只向着張李二人望望，好像臉上還帶了微笑（二○）</p>

<p>我有一張前淸光緖間的時敏新報，内容簡單極了。政治社會新聞都很缺乏，只有轅報，牌示，邸抄等；副刊却很豐富：有新笑譚，有施楠楚著的光亞新裨史小說。現在讀起來，眞覺得别有風味，姑引一則讖言奇異如下：「咸豐元年辛亥科楚北鄉試，天下有道則庶人不議兩句題，某解元起講末句云：覺太平景象，宛在目前也。時湖南告警閱一年而楚北陷，太平天國字樣，告示門牌旗幟，滿目皆是。此生故作吉祥，以投時好，不料竟成讖語。」這不是紅羊豪俠傳之類的好資料嗎？</p>
<p>談到内地的報紙，在我保留的幾十種中，没有一種是完美的。河南晚報的體裁很好，北京晚報的格局很新，江西饒州民報的社論很正當，這都是它們特别的長處。提倡白話文的報紙，最完善的當推北平白話實報，全用的新式標點。</p>
<p>廣州的報紙内容别的先不用提，附刊可算壞極了：全是些筆記爛調式的東西，比較起來自以民國日報較著稱。但總比不上别地的報紙吧。</p>
<p>餘如天津，北平，濟南，南京……等處，我一時不能多講。想不到小小的報紙附刊收集起來，倒也有一大肚皮的歷史呢！</p>

<p>錢是有錢人獨占的。照鏡子的猿猴，並不知道看見的就是自己。</p>
<p>若要向人借錢，就是出賣了自已。</p>
<p>没有錢的人談戀愛，好比聾子聽音樂。</p>
<h3 id="c8">紅紙包 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>— 春雨樓主</p>
<p>紅紙包的妙用眞廣，而且含有一種神秘的意義。例如請中醫診病，開了藥方以後，你就得在自邊掏出一個紅紙包，算是診費，數目自數角至數元，可是醫生客氣的，須要和你謙讓一番，從没有當面拆點包内數目，這就顯見紅紙包的玄奥。</p>
<p>更有一樁事，使我莫名其妙，從小的時候，天天患瘧，來勢非常凶猛，數日以後，面黄肌瘦，不思飲食，父母却很憂慮，但不知道吞服金鷄納霜，專門弄些小秘方，或是請人畫一道符咒在糕上，淸晨對着太陽吃。或是請人把瘧鬼送出門外，結果都没有見效。一天母親用了一張小紅方紙，内中包了生米七粒，茶葉七張，順治銅錢一個。放在我的身邊，母親陪我一同出門遊玩，走到十字路口，把紅紙包暗中抛去，不能回頭瞧，我照樣的做了，果然這天瘧疾未來。</p>
<p>湖州某女因操淫業，但又須顧到丈夫面子，就想了一個利用紅紙包的妙法。這法子就是在門口放一個紅紙包，暗示内中有人，丈夫不進門來，如没有紅紙包放在門口，就表示内中没有客人，這的確是一個極妙的暗示法。</p>

<h3 id="c10">牛屠夫 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>— 沈瘦若</p>
<p>因了恢復祀孔舊典，而使我廻憶到牛屠夫。</p>
<p>前淸祀孔，春秋二次，頂重要的祭品，就是被稱爲太牢的牛。出錢的是衙門，經手的是禮房，採辦的是牛屠夫。而其間很多趣味的弊端，於是乎發生了！</p>
<p>假如，衙門裏發交牛價三十元於禮房的話，那末，心善些的禮房，至少要揩上十元的油，心狠一些，當然是一半，或者是再過分些，然後轉給牛屠夫去採辦。</p>
<p>牛屠夫的名目，是官廳給諭承充的，對於祀孔採辦太牢，當然要當差，但是要他貼本，那也不是生意經。斧頭吃鑿子，鑿子吃木頭，他當然也有可吃的去處。</p>
<p>各鄉牛頭，（就是買賣牛隻的經紀人）是積習相沿下來要買牛屠夫的賬的，所以牛屠夫非但每年要向他們收取陋規，而且採辦太牢，也是責成他們供給的。倘使他們或有不買他賬的話，哼！哼！對不起，只消借端仍了一張票子，請客票就來了。因此不得不買他的賬的情勢，也是牛頭們說不出的苦衷啊！</p>
<p>同時，牛屠夫必然是劊子手，殺牛和殺人，都由他一手包辦，可說是人獸的一座頭號屠宰機器。所以他的態度，我至今惮憬着是非常的威風和兇惡，可怕得很！</p>
<p>小食譜</p>
<h3 id="c11">秋季的當令食品 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— 朱</p>
<p>天雖仍是亢旱，然而下了幾次陣雨，早晚巳含滿了嫩凉。秋風瑟瑟，大地上早巳烟凝山紫，蟲聲䀨耳。人們經了酷熱的夏天，到了這嫩凉天氣，胃口自然特别轉佳：並且春花秋實，也這時季，鱸肥蟹黄，菱美芡鮮，各種果實，也都當令上市。漫步市廛，橘黄梨白，紅紫滿眼，不禁食指大動，爰將秋季當令食品，擇記若干，作小食譜。</p>
<p>（一）菜肴</p>
<p>童子雞　這幾天的雞，雖非碩大雄壯，然而巳羽毛豐滿，雛形全無。這種雞，正像靑春少年，滿含朝氣，雞肉是嫩嫩的，入口而化。在者透之下，骨頭也嫩得可以咀嚼，味道更是鮮腴肥美，並且滋養料，尤十分豐富，白煮紅燒，都其味無窮，假使煮成雞汁，還是絶妙的補品哩！</p>
<p>蟹　蟹是秋季當令的美味，與松江之鱸，一般的名馳江南。在蓼紅蘆白的湖畔，郭索横行，快人朶頥。蘇州的陽澄湖，是産蟹著名的。那種蟹，爪上的毛，黄黄的透着金光，爪力很足，能够在廣漆檯上豎着橫行，所以呌金爪陽澄。祗可惜今年亢旱爲災，陽澄湖也乾涸不少，當然要應響蟹的産量了。蟹除了搗薑瀝醋，蒸食大嚼外，和着麫粉煮食，或出着蟹肉（蟹粉）炒食，都是秋天當令的佳肴。蟹粉除炒食外，還可和猪肉蝦仁等做各種點心的饀兒，其味也鮮美可口的。</p>
<p>（二）果品</p>
<p>蘋菓　這幾天最價廉的果品，蘋菓和梨，最普通了。那紅艶艶的色彩，彷彿女孩兒臉上的胭脂，十分可愛。蘋菓不但可以消食，却病。西諺說「飯後一蘋菓，醫生無處用。」我國古方說蘋菓可治痢疾，現在西醫也證明蘋菓粉洽痢疾有絶大效力，足見蘋菓在消食之外，還有治疾的功效哩。</p>
<p>葡萄　葡萄中含多量的鐡質，有健胃和强身的効力，形態也像紫晶球兒，明凈可愛。葡萄酒固是絶妙佳釀，葡萄汁也鮮甜可口。可惜我國對於葡萄的培植，太不講究了，以致現在水菓舖中的葡萄纍纍然盡是舶來品了。在這外貨入超激增的國貨年，眞使人瞧着觸目驚心。</p>
<p>菱　蘇州的菱，是很有名的，並且種類繁多，依次上市，自秋初以至秋末，菱是不絶在市上的。蘇州的菱共有五種：小的，是銳角菱，圓角菱，大的，有小白菱，和尙菱，餛飩菱；生食，熟食都好，餛飩菱更香糯可口，爲菱中最上之品。</p>
<p>芡實　芡實是蘇州著名的土産，因他在水中的時候，包着外皮，好像鷄頭一般，所以俗名「鷄頭」。鷄頭的肉，白而晶圓，所以那位風流天子唐明皇，撫摸着貴妃乳頭，稱爲「新剝鷄頭肉，」於此也可見芡實形態的可愛了。芡實煮湯，淸香可口，碾碎了製漿煮食，也甜腴淸香，爲老年人唯一的滋補食品。</p>
<p>栗子白菓　栗子這幾天又上市了。市面上到處有着糖炒栗子的攤頭，那種栗子香糯甜美，在閒時嚼着，確比瓜子來得實惠。栗子除炒食外，和鷄肉等煮食，也很入味。白菓炒食，雖略帶苦味，可是煮粥或燒菜肴，却也十分可口的。</p>
<p>（三）餅食</p>
<p>月餅　是秋天應時的餅餌。蘇州的月餅，雖没有廣東的巨大而昂貴，却也葷素俱全，甜鹹均有，饀兒不下一二十種。其中甜的，以棗泥，荳沙，玫瑰，薄荷，爲美。鹹的以鮮肉爲最，在烘培出爐的當兒，其味之美，眞非筆墨所能形容哩！</p>
<h3 id="c12">御香縹緲錄 <a href="#c12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>他假裝着極忠誠的態度，說自己是奉了光緖的密諭，要來行刺太后，但撫心自問，實覺不忍，所以不惜違背了光緖的旨意，反來告密。他的話雖然是那樣的空洞，而且是一些没有實據，但太后竟完全信任了他。於是在當天的晚上，便由他率領了帶來的軍隊，簇擁着太后，用一種迃雷不及掩耳的手段，直入光緖的寢宮。太后這時正在盛怒之下，也不顧什麽體統，竟敎人把光緖從床上拖了起來，連話都不問一句，立卽强迫他簽就了讓還政權給太后的詔書。這一次生死關頭的鬥爭的結果，皇太后便依舊大權在握，恢復了往日的威風；而光緖可就大大的倒霉了！從此，太后發誓也不肯饒恕他，無論他說什麽話，一槪置之不理；當然，光緖對於袁世凱這一次的倒戈相向，自必銜之剌骨，飲恨無穿，可惜他終於不曾報得這個仇！當他隨着太后給這列黄色列車載着上天津去的時候，袁世凱所賞賜給他的政治犯的生活，已經過了六七個年頭了。　其實，後來一直到他死，也不曾恢復自由。</p>
<p>現在，我們看啊！這個囚犯式的光緖皇帝，巳走近了他的仇人的面前了！他雖然另有一輛車乘坐，但到了車站，旣有那麽許多的臣下前來接駕，他怎能一個人躱着不出來呢？他必須極鄭重地侍立在太后的後面，接受這些人的參拜。記得往日每逢太后看不見的時候，我和光緖隨便說話時，往往也聽見他說起他自己對於戊戌政變的感想：每次，他總是切齒痛駡這個揑造謊話，構陷他的袁世凱。所以我早就懷着一顆極興奮的心，打算看看他的袁世凱劈面相逢後的神情。（一二九）</p>

<h3 id="c13">創作與時間 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— 黄懷白</p>
<p>偉大創作的完成，是需要相當充分的時間，這是歷史上不可磨滅事實。隨便舉幾個例來說：</p>
<p>左思的三都賦，所以能傳誦一時，洛陽紙貴，是因爲他費了十年的工夫纔寫成的。哥德的詩劇浮士德，所以能震動世界的文壇，至今猶膾炙人口，也是他從二十三歲起到八十三歲止，整整用了五十年工夫，纔完成這部巨著。密爾頓在英國文壇上的地位，是次於莎士比亞而獲坐第二把交椅的。可是他的最偉大史詩！失樂園（paradiselost），也費了二十七年的光陰纔寫成的。他如湯姆孫的懶惰之堡（TheCastleoflndoleace），和哈代的暴君（Dynasts）都費了十年以上的工夫纔能脫稿。卽如短命的天才詩人拜倫，一生祇活了三十六歲，然而，他的一首呌做鄧裘恩（ＤＯＮＪＵＡＮ）的諷刺詩，先後也費了五年的時間，纔能殺靑。這些都是狠顯著的事實。我們從這些事實上面看來，可以推想到一個偉大作家對於他的創作，寫的時候是如何的辛勤而愼重。那末，拿這樣的作品去發表，所獲的榮譽及代價，自然能抵償他所犧牲的精力和時間了。所以被稱爲偉大作家的創作，都是以長時間的努力和心血去換得來的。他們所以登龍，自有其登龍之道，他們所獲的榮譽和地位，也並非僥倖或偶然獲得的。明白了這一點，我們可以肯定的說：創作的精粗，是和時間成正比的。</p>
<p>固然，歷史上也不難找出幾個才思敏捷的作家，像曹植和袁虎，一個是七步能詩，一個是倚馬可待。但是這些都是特出的天才，百年難遇一人的。敎育心理學家告訴我們：天才和低能都佔極少數，天賦予我們大多數的，還是中人之資。以中人之資而妄思媲美這少數特出的天才，非特弄巧成拙，而且也不可能的。</p>
<p>然而，回顧我們現在文壇上的情形是怎樣呢？在量的方面，所謂創作是一批一批的産出，倒亦可觀。可是在質的方面，除掉極少數的幾種作品值得欣賞外，大多數的是没有像樣的東西。作家們創作的慾望和勇氣，着實使人艶羨，可是他們創作的態度是太隨例了。這唯一原因，是他們忽略了創作所需要的時間。這樣一來，創作的速率是增加了，可是創作的内容，無疑的，是適得其反。結果，流行於出版界的，多半是些粗製濫造的作品。這也不能單獨歸咎作家的本身，書賈的敦促，和批評家盲目的鼓勵，也要負相當的責任。</p>
<p>最後，我希望作家們不要太珍惜時間了－文學的園地，不能一蹴而成，是需要充分的時間來耕耘的。多産的作家，不是我們現在所需要的，偉大的作家，纔是我們眞正的需要。因爲十斤鐡究不能抵一斤金子的價錢，這倒是一句老實話。</p>
<h3 id="c14">頭尾 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— 周木齋</p>
<p>只要不是健忘，總還記得過去曾有一句響亮的口號：「迎頭趕上去」！這是以自己的落後爲根據的。且不去管趕上没有趕上、不過迎頭總算迎過一時的了。</p>
<p>有人對這口號，起了懷疑，說：「趕，是要在尾巴後面趕的，迎頭如何趕法？旣然在尾巴後面趕，無論慢步加步，總得要一步一步的趕上去，跳是不行的」。</p>
<p>粗聽這話，倒也有理，好像那口號是不通了，而其實是斷字取義」的。你趕，人家不是不走，也許還要走的快些。倘在尾巴後面，假定速度是同等的。那末，人家的尾巴，老是你的頭，你的頭到處，老是人家的尾巴，趕，趕，趕，怎樣能够趕上？「迎頭趕上去」的意思，無非是要學取人家進步的事物，不要學取人家遺棄的糟粕，也就是要迎頭趕上，不要追尾逐　。自然，在迎頭趕上去的時候，倘能順便地看看尾巴，那是最好。人家的糞，也許可以供作我們的肥料的。但肥料只是肥料，切不要當作正經飯喫。</p>
<p>但這在人家尾巴後面趕，總還比不趕要好些。因爲人家的尾巴，總還比我們要前進些。——總還比在自己的尾巴後面趕自己的尾巴要好得多。在自己的尾巴後面趕自己的尾巴，好比立着的狗，不知是癢還是爲了别的什麽，回過頭來咬自己的尾巴，却咬不到，儘在那裏打團團轉，只給人們看了有趣。</p>
<p>人類的祖先，本有尾巴的。我們有句「國駡」，且是「古異的駡」，呌做什麽「衣冠禽獸」，雖是駡人，雖出於不懂科學的嘴裏，却暗合於人類學的。只因禽獸被衣冠了，才消失了一條尾巴。「風俗通」記有兩句的俚語：「狐欲渡河，無如尾何」。這是說狐未渡河時對於那條尾巴不能擺佈的惶惑。「易」曰：「狐尾濡火」。這是說狐在渡河時牠的尾巴折了爛汚，想來一定很懊喪的。可見狐是怎樣喫了尾巴的虧，人類該慶幸運。</p>
<h3 id="c15">廿四史應該整部發賣嗎？ <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— 佩韋</p>
<p>前幾天自由談所載稜磨先生「從二十四史說起」一文，就提到開明的二十五史；并且提出改編二十四史，把它分類刊行的意見。</p>
<p>我對於稜磨先生的意見大體是贊同的：但對於他說「二十四史根本不應整部發售」的話，却認爲有商量餘地。</p>
<p>二十四史爲什麽根本不應整部發售呢？稜磨先生提出兩種理由：（一）專研究某代的各方面的人，所需只某代及其前後兩代的史書，所以把二十四史整部發售，對於讀者是極不經濟的事。（二）專研究各代的某一方面的人，所需的是各史上的某一部分，所以爲便利讀者計，應該把二十四史分類刊行，不應全部發賣。我對於第一點，認爲稜磨先生把一姓一家的朝代的更換太重視了。其實歷史是聯綿不絶的，朝代的更換不過政治權的轉移，一切制度文物，都有它的承前啟後的關係。所以要研究某一代的制度文物，非得先把上下五千年的歷史作一個鳥瞰不可。便如我們要研究後魏的均田制度，便不能不追溯到古代的井田制，更不能中把秦漢以來豪强兼并土地的情形弄個淸楚，同時又不能不研究到均田制所給與後代的影響如何。這樣，他所需要的就不止「某代及其前後兩代的史書」了。第二點，稜磨先生主張分類刊行我也表示贊同；但我以爲分類刊行與全部發售不妨雙軌並進。二十四史究竟和普通的類書不同。我們要研究各代的某一方面，所需要的不僅是各史上的某一部分。例如二十四史裏的天文志，五行志之類，雖然是「爲尋常讀者所不能讀或無須讀」的一部分，但我們如果要研究封建社會的宗敎思想，天文志，五行志之類倒是絶好的參考資料。不僅如此，我們要研究歷代的經濟政策，土地制度，各史的食貨志自然是絶好資料，但有些史料要從食貨志之外去找尋的。便如漢書食貨志說，「秦孝公用商君，壞并田，開阡陌，急耕戰之賞，……故傾鄰國而雄諸侯」。究竟商君當時改變田制後成效怎樣，生産力有否增進，爲什麽壞井田開阡陌就得傾鄰國而雄諸侯，漢書食貨志裏没有明白告訴我們；於是我們就得去翻閱史記的商君傳，它告訴我們，自商君改變田制後，「家給人足」，又說「行之十年，鄉邑大治」。我們還可從其他的傳記裏去找尋證據，如史記李斯傳裏便有「孝公用商鞅之法，移風易俗，民以殷盛，國以富强」的話，李斯時代去商君未遠，可以作爲有力的旁證。因此，把二十四史分類刊行固然有便利之處：但讀者如果專從某一類裏去找尋某一類的材料，一定會把許多重要史料遺漏的。</p>
<p>此外稜磨先生又主張把各史的帝紀，列傳不妨依姓氏排列，改編一人名大字典。把各史的外國傳，四夷傳，匈奴傳，西域傳編爲專册。我以爲與其把各史的帝紀列傳重依筆畫排編，倒不如做一部完全的「二十四史人名索引」有意義得多（原有的史姓韻編，所列姓名只限於歷史上有傳的，或雖無傳而比較著名的，尙不及全史十之一，有重新編製的必要，不過這工作太大，非費十年五年的功夫不可）。至於把匈奴傳，西域傳另編專册，未始不是經濟的辦法；但我們倘單讀兩漢的西域傳而不讀張騫傳，班超傳，還是不够了解漢代對西域交通的情形的。</p>
<p>總之，我不反對稜磨先生的分類改編的主張，但我以爲二十四史根本和普通類書不同，帝紀，表，志，列傳都有它的錯綜相互的關係，雖「分類編印無損於原書的本質」，但整部的二十四史自有它的價值與需要，决不是「根本不應整部發售」的。</p>

<h3 id="c17">憶閬中（中） <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>— 川人</p>
<p>我們得在此中佔却一小時，做做文人鴉士的風雅勾當，靜賞閬山閬水，遠看閬苑仙樓，可是仔細一想，汗毛管兒裏的毫毛一根根筆竪起來！這個年頭兒，還在學痴人說夢，要流連光景什麽的，恐怕就是以瓜皮汁寫詩的呂洞賓也有些兒不慣吧！</p>
<p>據錦屏山上石刻呂祖瓜皮詩碑，上面說呂仙訪君平於此，以瓜皮作筆，瓜汁作墨，吟詩於石，後來好事人就照着原跡刻起字來。其詩云：「時當海晏河淸日，由鹿閒騎下翠台。只爲君平川底去，不妨却到錦屏來！」</p>
<p>足見呂祖做詩訪友，也要在海晏河淸的時候，我輩何人，也敢在海不晏河不淸之日來此冒昧麽？因此這一天詩恩就不在家，没有寫出半個句子來，其原因並不爲了别的。</p>
<p>城裏面有的是難民收容所，凡是祠堂廟宇，没有一處不是收容着通江南江巴中等縣的難民，一面由公家供給每日兩餐的稀飯，一面由私家自己煮一些兒黑飯，生活一直照這樣維持下來，好在並不需要做工，日子也暫且可以度，至於所内的汚穢奇臭，疾病傳染，照例是官民不管。本鄉本土的道地閬中人，雖然眼見得難民們吃白米飯而眼熱熱地，也屬無可如何，因爲他們供給官廳，官廳供給難民，本來是天地無私仁至義盡。别的事還能管得了嗎？</p>
<p>有某天的淸早，我在一家小茶館裏吃茶，談起商業蕭條的事來，一位啣旱烟管的老者，走到我的身邊，用手指在茶盞裏蘸蘸，在桌面上水畫着一個羅字，一個征字，一個伐字，他的意思是說姓羅的征伐太過了，我雖然懂了一點大意，但還想追問下去，可是他吐吐舌頭，掉轉身便走了！</p>
<p>正在定神時，忽然街上有佩手槍的走過，後面一位紅光滿面洋裝革履的軍官大踏步前進。不料斜刺裏一個老太婆，雙膝向前，撲通一跪，口呼「師長救命！」軍官乜了一眼，連喚身後衛兵道：「把她抓了！」這樣，他仍自不覺底揚長走去了。</p>
<h3 id="c18">鄉長先生（三） <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>

<p>「怎的呀！你發瘋了嗎？」接着是文嫂子哭呌聲。</p>
<p>「咱倒没有發瘋，你可發瘋了，怎麽連一個丈夫都不瞧在眼裏，茶水不見的。」</p>
<p>「哦！你爲了這個氣我嗎？」這回是文嫂子坐到竹椅上去了。「那好，那好，祗要你把我們一天三餐把足，不勞我向東向西挨面情，我就整天守候你茶水！總算也是個男人家了，怎麽連老婆兒子底飯碗都把不滿呀，——你個斬頭切腦格呀！你不要臉浮屍呀！你還當什麽鳥鄉長格呀！………」</p>

<p>馮文先生在這反守爲攻的文嫂子底襲擊下，祗得變更戰術，反攻爲守了。也就放低聲音，用這一套國駡，藉以解圍。然而文嫂子却不放過他。</p>
<p>「你也算有臉了，自己整天貼告示，跑區公所，爬山頭，自己一口糧，還要老娘設法。好的，你能踢，就讓老娘出門去，看老娘還會把爸娘交給我的這一付膿包養不活。你斬頭切腦個浮屍呀！……你！你！……」</p>
<p>文嫂子前伏後仰地，在竹椅上顚，竹椅支不住似地呌的兇。馮文先生知道今天碰到晦氣煞。於是連國駡戰術也放棄了，揀個公平的批評語，口口聲聲喊着「潑婦！潑婦！一轉身，把二脚往過道送。</p>
<p>兒子如鋼，像個小泥猪似地，在街頭滾。黑乎黑臉的抓東撥西，像怪有味兒的。在他，大槪不知道自己是個鄉長底兒子吧！眞是晦氣年口！</p>
<p>在門前街道上站了一會兒，聽聽屋内哭聲放低了，於是稍稍安了些心。</p>
<p>「他媽的，眞也没有話說！」這回，馮文先生對自己心上放了一條冷箭。「可不是嗎做了鄉長，還愁餓死，這世界還成個什麽世界嗎？」</p>
<p>想着，也就把眼睛向街頭浮去。</p>

<p>— 余雲軸</p>
<p>桂枝之能發汗。本經雖無明文。而别錄有之。且徵諸仲景書中。用桂枝湯發汗者。歷歷可數。如太陽上篇曰。「服桂枝湯。大汗出。脈洪大者。與桂枝湯如前法。」又曰。「服桂枝湯。大汗出。後。大煩渴不解。脈洪大者。白虎加入參湯主之。」此皆言服桂枝湯後大汗。則桂枝不僅能發汗。且能發大汗矣。即桂枝湯服法中所謂如水流離也。又如右陽中篇曰。「太陽病外證未解。脈浮弱者。當以汗解。宜桂枝湯。」又曰。「病常自汗出者。此爲榮氣和。榮氣和者。外不諧。以衛氣不共榮氣諧和故耳。……復發其汗。榮衛和則愈。宜桂枝湯。」又曰。「病人藏無他病。時發熱。自汗出而不愈者。此衛氣不和也。先其時發汗。則愈。宜桂枝湯。」又曰。「傷寒不大便六七日。頭痛有熱者。與承氣湯。其小便淸者。知不在裏。仍在表也。當須發汗。若頭痛者必衂。宜桂枝湯。」又曰。「傷寒發汗巳解。半日許。復煩。脈浮數者。可更發汁。宜桂枝湯。」陽明篇曰。「陽明病。脈遲。汗出多。微惡寒者。表未解也。可發汗。宜桂枝湯。」又曰。「病人煩熱。汗出則解。又如瘧狀。日晡所發熱者。屬陽明。脈實者宜下之。脈浮虚者宜發汗。下之與承氣湯。發汗宜桂枝湯。」太陰篇曰。「太陰病。脈浮者。可發汗。宜桂枝湯。」此皆仲景用桂枝湯發汗之明文也。又太陽上篇末條有「增桂令汗出」之語。而太陽中篇。小柴胡湯後加减曰。「若不渴。外有微熱者。去人參。加桂枝三兩。温覆微汗。愈。」此增加桂枝以發汗之明文也。然傷寒論中。又有桂枝加附子湯主發汗漏不止。桂枝甘草湯主發汗過多。桂枝二越婢一湯主無陽不可發汗等文。於是又疑桂枝非發汗之藥。是以王海藏以桂枝爲非能開腠理發出其汗。又非能閉汗孔。而歸其功於調營和衛。夫營衛本身。尙未明白確定。調和之云。更無從說。甚矣舊醫之敢爲荒誕也。雖然。此非海藏之罪。罪在仲景也。仲景傷寒論屢多矛盾之言。其言營衛也。太陽中篇曰。「病常自汗出者。此爲榮氣和。榮氣和者。外不諧。以衛氣不共榮氣和諧故爾。以營行脈中。衛行脈外。復發其汗。榮衛和則愈。宜桂枝湯。」又曰。「病人藏無他病。時發熱。自汗出而不愈者。此衛氣不和也。先其時發汗則愈。宜桂枝湯。」此則以汗自出者爲榮氣和。衛氣不和。以發汗也和衛矣。其榮氣本自和。無調和之必要也。太陽上篇曰。「太陽中風。陽浮而陰弱。陽浮者熱自發。陰弱者汗自出。」此則以汗自出者爲陰弱。舊醫書陰陽二字。用途至廣。或指血氣榮衛言。或指脈言。此條陰陽二字。指脈言。亦卽指營言指血言也。何以知之。此條以微與浮對立。浮是脈象。知微亦脈象也。然太陽中篇曰。「若下之。身重心悸者。不可發汗。當自汗出乃解。所以然者。尺中脈微。此裏虚。須表裏實。津液自和。便自汗出。愈。」又曰「假令尺中遲者。不可發汗。何以知然。以榮氣不足血少。故也。」總此兩條觀之。所以知不可發汗者。以尺脈微尺脈遲故也。尺脈遲微。則歸其因於裏虚於榮氣不足。更申之曰血少。然則其所謂裏虚者。無他。榮氣不足也。質而言之。則血少也。又太陽上篇曰。「脈微而惡寒者。此陰陽俱虚。不可更發汗更吐更下也。」成無已注曰。「陽，表也。陰，裏也。脈微爲裏虚。惡寒爲表虚。」然則脈微裏虚。卽陰虚陰弱。亦卽榮氣不足血少矣。太陽中篇曰。「太陽病發熱汗出者。此爲榮弱衛强。故使汗出。欲救邪風者。宜桂枝湯。」可知陰弱卽榮弱矣。吾故曰。前條之陰陽。指脈言。亦卽指氣血榮衛言也。其所謂陰。卽營也。乃觀仲景之文。則曰。「陰弱者。汗自出。」又曰。「自汗出者。此爲營氣和。」徐洄溪曰。「榮氣和者。榮氣不病。」夫陰弱卽榮氣不足。然則榮氣不足。卽榮氣不病乎。此傷寒論言營衛之矛盾也。其用桂枝也。太陽上篇曰。「桂枝本爲解肌。若其人脈浮緊。發熱汗不出者。不可與之也。常須識此。勿令誤也。」此言無汗不可用桂枝。垂戒深矣。乃桂枝湯方後曰。「遍身熱熱微似有汗者。益佳。」是其未服湯以前。并微似有汗者而亦無之也。吾不知其所謂汗自出者。且較微似汗者更微乎。又曰。「若不汗。更服。依前法。又不汗。後服小促其間。」又曰。「若汗不出。乃服至二三劑。」吾不知其所謂不可與桂枝湯之無汗。與此須服至二三劑之汗不出。將若何分别耶。</p>
<p>又太陽中篇曰。「發汗後不可更行桂桂湯。汗出而喘。無大熱者。可與麻黄杏仁甘草石膏湯。」柯韻伯曰。「仲景每於汗下後表不解者。用桂枝更汗。」又曰。「汗下後表未解者。更行桂枝湯。是治風寒之常法。」於此可見發汗後不可更行桂枝湯之言。爲矛盾矣。以其喘耶。則喘家作桂枝湯。加厚朴杏仁斯可矣。以其汗耶。此正宜用桂枝。何以舍枝而用麻黄。以其無大熱耶。何以用石膏。此以舊說繩之。皆不可通者也。故柯氏改「汗出而喘」爲「無汗而喘。」以合方中之麻黄。改「無大熱」爲「大熱」。以合方中之石膏。說雖未當。成知其不可通也。陳修園謂喘爲麻黄本證之喘。以汗出爲麻黄本證之汗未出。以無大熱爲熱　於内。上乘於　。外熱反輕。說雖未當。誠知其不可通也。然說者雖多。求其毫髮無遺憾者。竟不可得。此無他。仲景本自矛盾。非後賢所能救也。仲景之書。矛盾極多。而於桂枝湯爲尤甚。研井廖平。乃謂桂枝湯不止一方。必有數方同名桂枝湯者。如承氣湯之有大小承氣調胃承氣之類。於是摭拾金濟總錄之四味桂枝湯，五味桂枝湯等十九方以實之。以爲得此而桂枝湯之說。始能昭明。其說雖新。非起仲景於九原而質之。誰能信其果否耶。</p>

<p>— 一知</p>
<p>最近北大敎授劉復（半農）先生因病逝世。他是患回歸熱病而死的。起病的時候不遇有些熱度。因爲當地没有檢騐機關。不能够明白他的病原。等到回北平以後。方才發覺是回歸熱。可是巳來不及了。有許多人因此責備新醫。不知這眞是因爲没有新醫。所以劉先生犧牲了。要是當地有良好的檢騐機關。立刻抽血檢騐。騐明病原。加以治療。那末今天的劉先生當不仍舊在北大的講壇上嗎。我們因此感覺到新醫的重要。特别在鄉村裏新醫藥的需要。我們要知道在同等情形之下犧牲的不知有多少。劉先生不過是其中的一人而巳。</p>
<p>回歸熱是一種急性傳染病。他的病原於一八七三年爲歐本滿爾氏Obermaier所發見。是一種螺旋形的細菌。侵入人體的途徑大抵由於蚊，蝨，臭蟲的吃咬。因爲這種細菌時常在蚊蝨的排洩物裏。人體經過一度的吮咬後。發癢抓破。病菌因此傳入人體。此外患回歸熱病人的唾液。淚液，乳汁。小便等分泌物裏頭。亦含有病菌。所以傳染的途徑更廣。空氣，日用品，被褥等等。均是傳染的媒介。</p>
<p>病菌侵入人體後。約隔五日或八日就可發現病象。一起就頭痛，背痛，惡寒，漸漸而週身發酸痛。因之體温就上升到四十至四十一度（華氏一百○二度到一百○五度）熱度時高時低。但是相差無幾。大抵六七天之後。突然發汗。熱度方退。但是過了幾天後（）約四天到十四天不定。）又然依樣發作。六七天之後。熱度復退。又過幾天。又發熱。又照樣來回一次。所以呌做回歸熱。大抵第二第三次的熱度較第一次爲輕。亦有經過二三次後自己痊愈的。不然就因心藏衰弱或其他連帶引起的肺肝病而死亡。</p>
<p>我們遇是這等病人。應該立刻騐血。血裏過就有回歸熱的螺旋菌發見。</p>
<p>治療的方法現時最常用的是九一四的注射。大抵一經注射後。熱度就能退去。此外背痛，頭痛，嘔吐，便秘等等。可應用輕微的對症藥劑。自易痊愈。</p>
<p>這病没有免疫性。所以傳染過之後。仍舊有第二次傳染的可能。</p>
<p>預防的方法完全在於公衆衛生方面。就是對於患病者的注意。一有此種病人發見。應當立刻設法隔離。病人用過的一切器具。應當立卽消毒。病人的排洩物。不可遺留於外。如是則病菌没有生存的機會。那末蚊蟲等更無所施其技了。</p>

<p>（三十九）鈎蟲（又名十二指腸蟲）</p>
<p>（問）鈎蟲是怎樣的蟲類？</p>
<p>（答）鈎蟲，是寄生在人體小腸上段的一種蟲類，尤其是十二指腸内是他們的寄生所在，所以又名十二指腸蟲。</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>（問）鈎蟲的形態怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）鈎蟲，雄的長十粍，雌蟲長十八粍。口部有鈎和齒，用來緊咬着腸壁的黏膜而寄生的。</p>
<p>（問）鈎蟲的蟲卵形態怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）蟲卵是卵圓形，他的内容含有多數分裂球。卵殼很薄，無色。</p>
<p>（問）人體腸管内被鈎蟲寄生之後，要起什麽病狀？</p>
<p>（答）鈎蟲寄生的人，往往起劇重的貧血症狀，全身倦怠，頭痛心悸亢進，眩暈，耳鳴，浮腫的皮膚，蒼白的容貌，心臟起雜音，頸靜脈也有雜音。</p>
<p>（問）病人排出的大便中，有没有異狀？</p>
<p>（答）鈎蟲病人的大便中，含有蟲卵，嗜伊紅細胞，夏苛，來登氏結晶體，和潛在性出血。</p>
<p>（問）病人自己覺有什麽病狀？</p>
<p>（答）病人自己，往往訴口渴，食慾减退，惡心，腹部疼痛，並起鼓腸。</p>
<p>（問）驅除鈎蟲的藥品，有那幾種？</p>
<p>（答）有四㲶化炭，麝香草腦（Ｔhymol）藜藿油（Oilofchenopodium）等。</p>
<p>（問）四㲶化炭的用法怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）在驅蟲上一天，給病人吃些半流動食物像牛乳，雞卵薄粥，午後十時用蓖麻子油或硫酸鎂内服，使腸内充分排除淸凈。到了驅蟲的當天，早晨用三立方糎的四㲶化炭，裝膠囊内服，隔二小時後，再一次服二○—三○克的硫酸鎂。照這樣連服數天，使完全排除蟲體。食品不妨照常飲食，不必像第一天那樣注意了。</p>

<p>（問）服用這種藥品的時候，有没有禁忌的東西？</p>
<p>（答）因爲酒精有溶解麝香草腦的緣故，所以也要忌酒類。</p>
<p>（問）藜萑油的用法怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）上一天也行驅蟲準備，早晨空腹時取藜藿油二十滴裝膠囊，一次服完。隔二小時服一次蓖麻子油，使排除蟲類。</p>

<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（十五）外聽道炎（耳癤）</p>
<p>外聽道炎otitisexterua在各種耳病當中，要算很多的一種病。我們在臨診上，也是時常遇得着的。並且女子是比較容易發生些。普通生在一側。生在兩側的很少。他的主要原因。就是在外聽道皮膚的皮脂腺或耵聹腺管内侵入化膿菌（如葡萄狀球菌）而起。不過外聽道的皮膚。本來具有抵抗力。可以阻止化膿菌的侵入。但是這種抵抗力有時會薄弱。或竟没有抵抗。此時化膿菌方才可以侵犯進去。抵抗力薄弱或没有抵抗的理由很多。通常可分一器械的刺戟，像外聽道的搔扒（自己用挖耳器挖耳，或理髮匠用小刀括耳等類）。二，化學的和温熱的刺戟。三，化膿性中耳炎流出膿汁的刺戟。四，游泳時，不淸潔的水。流入耳内。</p>
<p>本病的主要症候。常以耳痛而發作。耳痛大都夜間比較日裏，痛得劇烈。甚至妨碍安眠。如果牽引耳翼。或壓迫耳外口都。則痛更烈。有時感覺開口困難和咀嚼不便。此時若用耳鏡檢查外廳道。常可探得限局性的壓痛和患部的發赤腫脹。患者往往發熱。精神不振。如腫脹增劇。那就外聽道完全閉鎖。聽覺亦因此而障碍。同時耳前或耳後。亦常發赤腫脹。甚至化膿。</p>
<p>本病的經過。約在一週左右。但很容易再發。往往又可續發瀰蔓性。外聽道炎。Otitisexteruadiffusa此時外聽道壁特别發赤腫脹。先起表皮剝脫。後成潰瘍。表面非常濕潤。分泌物爲漿液性或膿性。常常混有剝離的表皮細胞和耳耵聹。爲汚穢泥狀物。而帶惡臭。在將告治愈的時候。方始停止分泌。外聽道的皮膚面。也就漸次乾燥。</p>
<p>外聽道炎的預防法。最緊要的，就是預防化膿菌的侵入。避免外聽道的刺戟（廢除濫行挖耳的習慣）。注意汚水的侵入耳内。原來巳有化膿性中耳炎的時候。應即治療。使之無膿。如果外聽道一旦感覺疼痛和腫脹。那就立刻要由專科醫師診治了。</p>

<p>肺結核症的欬血是怎樣的情形呢？他是在本病每個時期裏面都可以發生的。他的形狀是單獨的小血絲血點，和膿性的痰混雜在一起的。有時候數量是比較增多了，差不多有數食匙光景，這是泡沫狀的鮮血，尋常是經過數次劇烈短咳而排出的。最多的時候，也可以有一立特光景，和胃出血情形彷彿的，這種大出血，僅見於嚴重的空洞性變化和極端前進的本病的，他的例證比較前者可是少多了。病人經過一次出血後，在他的痰裏面，也同樣多少帶上一點血色的，這種情形，大槪幾天後，纔逐漸减退而照常的。欬血屢次發作的例證，也很多的；這種病人在發生前，時常覺得喉間奇癢的，或且是有甜和血腥的氣味似，這無疑地是一個先兆了。經過屢次欬血的病人，很容易連帶發生重態貧血的。欬血發生後，有時會温度增高，脈搏亦因之加數的；這一種現象，大槪三五日後會逐漸减低的，所謂欬（血熱）是。但如果這熱度是長期如此的，其至特殊增高的，這當是本病在那裏前進侵襲了；有時也可以引誘急性粟粒結核發生的。這方面的預後情形，當然和前者是不能並論的。</p>
<p>欬血一症象，和尋常的吐血（卽胃出血）是狠容易混雜在一起的：其實這兩方面的本病，完全是不同的，他們簡單的鑑别方法，也值得在此處提出的。欬血的血液是帶鮮紅色，有泡沫的，不凝固的；吐血是黯色或黑色，無泡沫的，時常凝固成圓塊的。欬血是和粘液和膿混雜的；吐血則裏面混有食物成分的。欬血的反應是鹼性的，吐血是酸性的。除開這排出物本身的不同點外：欬血的血液係由咳嗽排出的，同時有肺部心臟症象的；吐血係由嘔吐而出的，大半有胃部肝部症象的。這幾個異點是狠明顯的，就是病者本身也容易區别的；但是實的變例還是狠習見的。在肺部大出血的時候，一部分血液也會咽下，末後重由嘔吐出來的；如果這血液在胃部停留過久了，他們也會由鮮紅泡沫狀而變爲褐色的。這樣一來，差不多和胃部出血是一樣的；不特病者會認錯，就是醫家一時也會分别不淸的，這完全須靠這二方面的局部精密診察，方可以水落石出的。</p>
<p>除開肺結核症外，其他的病症，像肺瘤腫肺栓塞心臟瓣膜病氣管枝擴張等症，有時都會發生欬血的；但遠不及肺結核症的多。我們不妨說一句：假使這病人發現欬血了，雖未必定是肺結核症，但十之八九是屬諸此症的。至在肺結核症本身，也並不是個個發生欬血的，據最近的統計，差不多祗有四分之一的數目：在作者所診治的病人中，始終不發生欬血也是狠多的。在甲期本病發生欬血的，差不多有百分之十光景，其中不發生第二次的例證也是狠多的。總之，發生欬血的病人，幾乎全體是有肺結核嫌疑的：但没有發生的，决不能說不是肺核症：這一點眞相，是大家應該認識淸楚的。</p>

<h3 id="c26">日本水産品傾銷之救濟 <a href="#c26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>— 若搴</p>
<p>日本水産品的傾銷，以及其結果之有害於吾國漁業，前文巳言之矣。（詳見本刊抽作「日本水産品傾銷的檢討」一文、防止方法，惟有從關稅方面，以爲治標之策。可是我國的關稅，中間幾經奮鬥，到如今勉可自主，但是關務人員之重要者，多是外國人。</p>
<p>水産品在民食上有着重要的地位，就中像鹽乾魚類是普遍於中下社會，而魚翅海參，社會習慣上成爲待人欵客的尊貴上品，國内生産的不足，取給於洋貨，久而久之，喧賓奪主，本國海産日漸式微，進口海産，竟得着貿易上重要地位，尤其是日本運來的海産，無孔不入，年多一年，（沿海漁民的生計，將爲葬送殆盡。</p>
<p>水産品在咸豐六年的稅則上，就訂立了多種稅則，大部是從價的值百抽五；就是從量的，也以此爲標準。華盛頓會議結果，允加附加稅，以後農商部提出的稅則中，鮑魚，有刺黑參，無刺黑參，白海參，干貝，魚肚，魚脊翅，魚胸翅，魚翅等，俱認爲奢侈品，稅率訂爲百分之十。十一年修正的稅則中，水産品稅率也增高很多。十九年的國定稅則公布，更有着顯著的增高。二十二年又有修正。現在把水産品歷屆稅則彙列一表如下：</p>

<p>註：二十二年修正的稅率是以金單位計算</p>
<p>十九年國定稅則的公布，是解除了日本阻撓吾國關稅自主而訂立了中日關稅互惠恊定而成立的。可是在中日關稅互惠恊定中，日本因水産品是以中國爲唯一的輸出市塲，至亦在提出互惠之列，結果是訂在附載的第二項，這樣就使輸入最盛壓迫最烈的日本水産品，大都靠着恊定而超脫國定稅則。所以這幾年日本水産品的輸入特别猛烈，在此是需要加以檢視的了　　如果我們把他們比較一下，那末恊定稅率要比國定稅率减低得多，其中除去未列名鹹魚·海帶絲·海帶三項相同外，像白海參一項，减輕百分之四十六，减得最少的鮑魚罐頭一項，也减輕百分之二十七，此外是减輕百分之四十二·三十八·三十三·三十一·二十九·二十八不等。如果再和二十二年修正的稅率比較，的確要增高很大，而能予日産以一大打擊，最高是干貝一項，從恊定稅率的每担九·一○，加到每担二九·○○，實增的百分比爲二一八·六八，就是最低的海帶絲一項，也增到百分之七十七，現在列表於下，以見一般。</p>
<p>魚介海産品　單位　國定稅則　恊定稅則　二十二年修正稅則　恊定較國定减少之百分比　二十二年修正比恊定增加之百分比</p>

<p>二三一　鮑魚（罐裝）　每担０·七０　五·二五　一三·００　二七·六　一四八</p>
<p>現在把輸入的價值，加以比較，則恊定稅則時期各月份平均的日本水産品輸入額，要比二十二年修正稅則時期各月份的平均輸入額，增加百分之十九又八，（參看中行月刊九卷二期「海關進口新稅則之研究」一文）如果我們以逐項貨物來比較（爲便於比較起見，即以最近二十一，二十二兩年輸入的總數檢視），那更見恊定時期的輸入要比修正後增加很多，像帶一項，二十一年輸入三七九，七八五擔，價圵　，一五一，七五金單位，而二十年就祗有一九五，九八一擔，價值四五七，○五三金單位，减少幾及三倍，况且二十二年的數字，一部份的輸入尙在恊定稅則時期，足見恊定稅則予日本水産品的輸入確有極大帮助的。現在把與恊定有關的水産品的輸入數字列表如下，就足以證明了。</p>

<p>（註二）有▲符號者其稅率係照國定稅則徵收，不在恊定稅則以内。</p>
<p>上表已可看出吾國全部水産輸入中，日産占有成數的巨大，這是日人籍恊定關稅而得順意輸入，所以在我國水産輸入國别分析中，日産量是壓到任何一國的，如果再把恊定稅則時期的輸入數字，取得各各的平均數後，日産要占百分之六十八，可是到二十二年稅則時期（至二十三年五月底），則日産祗佔全部的百分之四十六又五，足見恊定稅則的有利於日産輸入，更足見水産稅率的增减，與日産輸入是極有關連的。</p>
<p>最近爲欲增收入，稅則於七月一日起重行修正公布。這次進口稅則第六類屬於魚介海産的仍是二十五種，其中如鹹靑鱗魚，鹹薩門魚，未列魚鹹魚三項，這一次都從從量稅改成從價稅，而鮑魚，海參，江瑶柱，魷魚墨魚，海帶絲，海帶等六種，則多减低稅率，减輕最甚者是二九二號的海帶絲，從以前的百公斤二·三○改爲一·七○，計减百分之三十五又七，現在把减稅的幾項列表如下：</p>
<p>品名　單位　廿二年稅率　廿三年修正稅率　修改稅率比原有者减輕之百分率</p>
<p>二七五鮑魚甲散裝　百公斤五一·００　四二·００　二一·四％·</p>
<p>乙罐裝　…　二一·００　一八·００　一六·六</p>
<p>二七六海參甲黑刺參　…　五一·００　四三·００　一八·四</p>
<p>乙黑光參　…　三五·００　三０·００　一六·六</p>
<p>二七八江瑶柱（乾貝）　…　四八·００　四０·００　二０·０</p>
<p>二八二魷魚墨魚　…　一七·００　一四·００　三·四</p>
<p>二九二海帶絲　…　二·三０　一·七０　三五·二</p>
<p>二九三海帶　…　一·七０　一·三０　三０·七</p>
<p>减輕最甚的海帶絲，二十一年是三十八萬担的價值一百十五萬金單位，二十二年爲了稅率增加，低至二十萬担，價值四十六萬金單位，到了今年七月份就有大量輸入，一個月中進口即有六千餘担，眞可謂效力立見！照歷來的統計，日産的輸入占全部輸入的百分之九十九以上；此外像干貝也是占全部輸入的百分之九十七以上，鮑魚占百分之七十以上，何况此項鮑魚干貝海參等多是奢侈品，購買的伸縮力極强，如果稅率低，價格廉，銷路就要暢，而日産的輸入，也是必然爲多的。</p>
<p>從理論而言，中國是應該並且可以自由提高關稅的。好像一九二五年通過的關稅自主案，在關稅定率條例第一項，指定的是：</p>
<p>「外國貨品運入本國通商口岸時，按照本條例所定課稅辦法，征收進口稅。」</p>
<p>這是說任何外國貨進口，多應有担任關稅定率條例「所定課稅辦法」的義務。再爲保護本國事業，對於外貨臨時增加稅率，關稅定率條例中也是許可的，並且規定三項，就是（一）報復稅率，（二）相穀稅率，（三）不當廉價防過稅率等。現在日本水産品是削價傾銷，我們且看這第三項的規定（原條例第八條載）：</p>
<p>「遇有外國貨品過意貶價，經政府認爲擾動市塲之虞時，得以命令於稅率表所列應有稅額外，加　與其正當價格相當之稅金，」</p>
<p>照此，中國對外來貨品的有害於吾事業者，加之以適當的增稅，是無可委棄的權利。民國十九年的工商會議中，也曾通過以反傾銷稅來防止傾銷的條件，中證政府早有實行的動機；而最近復有國營貿易的設計，那末第一步的正當的加稅，怎樣可以擱置着不進行呢？</p>
<p>再各國反傾銷稅的規定，先例極多，像加拿大會在一九○四年一九○七年迭次的修正反傾銷稅；紐西蘭種小國，也在一九○五年有年謂農業器具製造入口及發生法案；澳洲也有過二次的反傾銷稅；美國歷次的修正關稅，多是着眼於防止外國貨的傾銷，最近像德國法國以及歐洲中部的許多小國，多是用關稅保護政策，以使國内産業避免外來的壓迫的。</p>
<p>再如各國對於某項貨物，而加以特殊的稅率的，也是常有的事，就以水産品而論，如法國爲了要保護其本國的鰛漁業，就對美國製的蕃茄鰛魚，用高壓的手段，課以特别水産罐頭輸入稅，從一九三一年起，對每箱的美國貨和俄國貨，課稅約達國幣十六元，但同時對加拿大貨則課八元，日本貨更祇課四元。再如德國認爲日本産的蟹罐頭是奢侈品，就特别的課以每箱十八元的關稅。美國自從羅斯福總統受任後，爲保護國内水産事業及防止外貨傾銷起見，突在一九三三年十二月十五日發表保護防止計劃，水産品的入口稅，大部增高，而規定自一九三四年一月十三日起發生效力，像外國輸來的鮪魚罐頭，自值百抽三十起至值百抽四十五；油漬鰛魚每磅價不及九分者，按值抽收百分之三十至四十四。而對日本輸入的二枚貝罐頭，從五月三十一日起，又增加到值百抽五十二，再美國紐約因日本牡蠣苗輸入的衆多（二十二年三月運去九千箱，四月又運去三千箱，足見總數之大」，特禁止日本牡蠣苗從太平洋岸輸入而移植大西洋岸；同時太平洋岸各洲也倣行有禁止在太平洋岸輸入的趨勢。凡此多是十足表示「凡輸入水産品而有害本國水産業者，必須提高關稅或竟禁止入口。」</p>
<p>如果我們的水産事業：不願坐以待斃的話，那祇有破釜沉舟想盡方法的來「幹」！而所謂「幹」的方法，自應實行統制經濟下的輸入定分制爲最是。輸入定分制（QuataSystem）是近世各國關稅政策中重要的部門。如果作爲保護關稅政策而言，此制是以直接方法，適當地制限輸入的數量；而此制的方法，是參照國内的消費量與國内的生産量，而决定外國輸入的總量，俾可不影響於需要與供給的過剩或不足。再此制的實行，多不經特别的立法等法律手續，大都是用緊急命令施行的。現在吾國關稅，因受關稅條約的牽制，似無絶對的自由，像法國的關稅，也因爲受通商條約規定百分之七十二，所以以前或最近多應用輸入定分制的。</p>
<p>輸入定分制的特徵，是可以對輸入方面的各外轲，採取均等的或是比例的定分，即所謂「對外定分」。目前日本水産品是如此的傾銷如此的爲害我國漁業，可以給以少量的輸入許可，或者與各國輸入許可的數量相等，使其不能操縱市塲。最低限度我們可以知道預先輸入的確數，和實際的價格，而得到一種統制的機能。</p>
<p>輸入定分制對於本國的輸入商，原也應確定其各自的輸入數量，即所謂「對内定分」。目前吾國的輸入商，進貨多是盲目的進行，而他們尤其歡喜輸入日本貨，以貪圖易於獲利，更進一步，把輸入的日本貨改頭換面，以求早日脫售而助長日産傾銷的勢力，作者是一向主張貿易統制的，所以初步貿易商的統制，以此，是不可忽略的一點。</p>
<p>輸入定分制更應該自輸入總量，確定各月份的輸入量，而更應該注視國内産業界生産的狀態，以規定某某貨物在某某月份輸入的數量，即所謂季節的定分。像法國一九三一年七月至三二年七月的一年度中，規定十月的一般魚價，十二月的鹽乾魚，二月的罐頭魚類等的數量，因爲在這個時期中，是法國水産業生産的時期，借此以便保護産業界。至於我國在漁汛的時候—如江浙大黄魚小黄魚帶魚等漁汛時，所有的生産多運到上海，每天也達一萬擔左右，一時市塲即表示過剩的現象，加以運輸不便，無從把鮮魚迅速運出，致魚價低落，漁民受苦不少，但日本魚價更乘此時期過意削價傾銷，使魚價紛亂，漁業經濟整個崩潰，這種時期，原是應該實行「季節關稅」的時期，現在如果預先有着着輸入制限的「季節定分」，當然可以使國内産業避免外來的壓迫。</p>
<p>至此，我人可以相信輸入定分制，對於防止日本水産品的傾銷，如可以—並且應該實行的，但是我們在實行以前，應該有充分的研究，第一先得明瞭輸入定分制的具體的内容；第二是觀察國内水産經濟的地位；第三是分析舶來水産品！當然尤其注意於日産的輸入狀態，以及國内生産的狀態；最後自更應該具體地把握着現實的國民經濟狀態以及國際經濟界的趨勢。</p>
<p>此外一個最重要的預備工作，就是調查水産貿易的實况，更重要於獲得輸出入的正確的統計，最近全國經濟委員會在上海設立調查處，重要工作已規定有輸出入的調查一項，我人希望能對水産品多加注意的，詳密的計劃，本文不克多所討論，祇希望有關各方的注意凖備進行實施而已！</p>

<h3 id="c28">從同行嫉妬說起 <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>— 忻炘</p>
<p>同行嫉妬的事，套一句國粹救國論的術語，是「古巳有之」的，記得小時候，便時常聽到「同行如寃家」的話；而我們「商家」的看家本領，又祇會影射，冒牌，倣尤三套，在這自私主義日趨没落的今天，同行嫉妬的事實自然越會顯明的扮演出來。</p>
<p>不知道是那位聰明人，想出個「同行公議」的辦法來，想出這「同行公議」的力量來壓平市價，表面上，市價自然因爲議而平了，可是背地裏還是並不如此的，譬如綢緞店，賣價雖然可以同樣，是是放頭却加二加三悉隨尊便的，日子一多，公議的價目也就等於具文了。</p>
<p>有人一定會怪你不好好地連放頭也「公議」一下的。這句話說來似乎容易，實際上還是有許多困難的，爲了遷就顧客起見，手裏自然就鬆了些，卽使退一步說同樣都肯劃一不二，可是又有地址的熱鬧，冷靜，和開支的大小不同，而中國人又是有古怪脾氣死認住牌子越老越好的，這或許還可以用别種理由來駁復，可是最大的制命傷，却是貨色一擱了久不是壞掉便是落時，拿綢緞來做個證人，從前三四元錢一尺的什麽七色五色緞到現在連三四角錢一疋都無人顧問的。</p>
<p>看到「日久玩生」了，便再來下「同行公議」，可是這被客觀環境否决了的制度，「公議」的力量是一次比一次短促起來。</p>
<p>於是又有人憑着雄厚的資本來一下托辣斯政策，照着擾勝劣敗的公例，托辣斯政策自然收效一時的，因之近效的烟突便日漸多了起來，而手工藝者不得不丢了家裏的粗陋的工具到煤灰皮帶中去討一碗飯喫。</p>
<p>可是正當機械的力量殺退了手工業的時候，外來資本却又憑着先進國的種種優越，把它敗下陣來，而一方面呢，因爲這變幻的過快，更兼着資本主義的諸矛盾，使中國市塲更混亂了起來。</p>
<p>在這混亂局面中，手工業者一方面旣不得不丢了家中的粗陋的工具，而一方面，因了幼稚的工業便被外來資本的殺死，又深感到無工可做，何况又遇到世界不景氣的狂瀾，中國便在無可奈何中成了全世界傾銷的尾閭了。</p>
<p>二三流的商店處此層層壓迫下，旣不能抗拒這無法抗拒的勢力，而任其呑併當然又情有不甘，在不能認淸對象之前，便把那口毒氣「薄利多銷」的身上噴去。</p>
<p>可是卽使把眼前認爲仇敵的仇敵打倒以後怎樣呢？回答還是不允樂觀的，卽使退一步說，大家都打起了「薄利多銷」的招牌，那麽回答還是不允樂觀的，</p>
<p>不信，請看以後的事實來證明吧。</p>

<h3 id="c29">都市的一面 <a href="#c29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>— 晶雲</p>
<p>十點三十分鐘，從南京路新雅酒家出來，天空裏没有月亮，却有着棋子似的繁星。幾個人都帶着幾分闌珊的酒意，拖着沉重的脚步。</p>
<p>雖然三大公司和其他各大商店都老早就關了門了，可是，另一種生意，却很活躍地替代起來。從大玻璃窗橱的紅亮的霓虹光映射底下，我們可以很淸晰地購出一排排佇立着的油頭粉面的年靑的女性，在爲着生活强作歡笑，出賣她的肉體和靈魂。</p>
<p>——去呀，屋裏廂白相，去呀—</p>
<p>聲音是多麽動人，婉囀，温柔，黄鶯似的。</p>
<p>送上了一個妖媚的眼色，施展出狐狸般的女人所俱有的誘人的魔力：棉似的手，雪藕般的橫　了我的半腰，攬着，裝出怪親暱小鳥依人般的表情。</p>
<p>陡然地受到了這意外的刺激，眼前巳有點窘迫了，心兒像掛鐘似的撲撲地跳動得利害，臉孔熱灼灼的有點發燒。</p>
<p>——哈哈，阿隆，你今天帶着桃花運嗎。她軋着你做……</p>
<p>朋友們都笑着，灣着腰地笑着。</p>
<p>走到南京路口，行人和汽車依然是那麽地擁擠，風，從大建築物的頂尖瀉下來，淸新的，凉爽的，把身上的煩燥都吹散了，這時，酒意巳經完全消逝了，聽聽黄浦江裏往來着的小汽輪的「嘟嘟」的汽笛聲，幾個人都有點茫然地木立着。</p>
<p>相對無言地望望天空裏的繁星，和江海關的鐘樓出神。</p>
<p>——到底要上什麽地方去呢？</p>
<p>到這個時候，每個人的心好像給晚風吹醒了，方才覺得是在走路。</p>
<p>——租汽船到江心去兜風吧。</p>
<p>——那倒不如到外灘公園裏去坐坐。</p>
<p>目的地終於决定了，幾個人就魚貫地走進外灘公園的門。</p>
<p>我到上海來雖然有好多年頭，進外灘公園，今夜却是第一次，她給我的印象，是人頭那麽的多，比較任何一個公園都多。隨處都可以嗅到那種又酸又似乎帶着一點花香的肉的氣息；還有很多裝扮得蠻摩登的姑娘們像蝴蝶般地往來穿梭着，施展着她的魔力在鈎引遊園的客人。</p>
<p>（色情狂的集匯所，徵逐塲；它呑滅了靑年人的靑春，志氣，然後，連驅壳都抛到江裏去，讓它隨滾滾的潮水東流。）</p>
<p>在漸漸地　　去了，江海　輪時鐘的長短針并在一起巳指在十二時了，臨江的鐡欄杆巳給凉露潤上了一層潮濕了，遊客們也都吹得很凉爽地有些倦意地回到家裏去睡覺，然而，一部分得不到主顧的可憐人，還得爲了生活减低了價格去兜攬客人，在黑暗裏拚着死命掙扎着</p>
<p>（其實，從都市的外面看起來，以爲是多麽神聖，燦爛；但反觀它的黑暗面，它的汚濁，罪惡，是會把神聖，燦爛塗染得不堪親近的啊！）</p>
<h3 id="c30">血和汗 <a href="#c30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>— 珍</p>
<p>這是我永遠不能忘記的一件事實。</p>
<p>是我將離家鄉的前一天，我偶然地想起了我的仁慈的老伯，我就决定到老伯那裏去，一方面解解悶，一方面亦算辭行。</p>
<p>老伯正悶坐着拿起烟袋在裝烟，　了個安後，我就告訴他明天便將離鄉到上海的。</p>
<p>忽然他驚奇的望着我：</p>
<p>「還上大學堂麽」。</p>
<p>「是的」。我毫不在乎地答着。</p>
<p>不料老伯却搖了搖頭，而且從他老人家的無力的衰弱的花眼裏正射着萬分疑惑的光芒，把隻烟管亦放在一邊，向我道：「你們的大學堂，每年恐怕必得化上三四百塊錢，呵，這三四百塊錢，在我們鄉下……」老伯說到這裏，却停了起來，深深地嘆了口氣，才又繼續地道：「像現在這年頭，米價是這樣的賤，六塊錢一石也不到吧，唉，這三四百塊錢，不是需要六七十石的穀子才能調換得麽」？老伯用着力把聲音有意提高起來。「ＸＸ，你要知道，這六七十石的穀子　要着　人的老少血汗呢？姑算一畝田能收兩石穀，（那還是指那熟年說哪）那麽不是需要三十多畝田的收穫才能得到六七十石的穀麽？唉，三十多畝田，是需要多少的血汗來灌漑呢」！</p>
<p>老伯的一個音一個音正像鑽針一般刺着我的心。是的。一滴一滴的血和滬，終年不息的工作着，三十多畝田地的農家，統統把穀賣了，還只能勉强地供給一個大學生的費用。我感動的這時坐在一旁動一不動。我無言好應答。我深空地慚愧起來。我有那樣的權利麽？我會那樣的恨心麽？唉！我一個人就吸收着這樣無量的别人的血和汗。同時在我的眼前就浮起了那樣一幕驚人的慘劇：我像儼然見着一批批鄉村中血汗變相的現金，給許多靑年的男女，帶進都會裏，他們全然忘記了這銀質裏就鑲上了農人的血汗，一一地交給了戲院的老闆，舞塲的老闆，……我的頭昏了，我的眼前像滿佈了一堆堆血，一石石穀子，「老伯，我們再會。」我不能够再坐下去了。</p>
<h3 id="c31">談口 <a href="#c31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>— 𡛂嬪</p>
<p>𡛂</p>
<p>口是吃飯的傢伙，又是談話的工具；爲了牠會吃飯，會談話，在這一出一入間，弄得我們顚顚倒倒，慌慌忙忙，非要它自己談談自己不可。</p>
<p>因爲它說出來的話一謙抑，就不免被人駡爲拍馬屁，它說出來的話一驕傲，更就不免被人駡爲吹牛皮；它說出來的話硬了，就要被人怨恨；它說出來的話軟了，就要被人說是没用的東西。直爽些，又要得罪人，詭譎點，又算欺騙人；誠實些，被人愚弄；虚僞點，失了信用。應談談的它不談，就是不會說話；不應該談的　談了，就要碰釘子。弄得我們這不好，都不好，眞是可惡極了。</p>
<p>再，談到它的吃飯，更就談不盡談了。一日三餐，今天吃，明天吃，後天吃，不會休息（因故休息，例外。）一天，但也没見它會滿出來。况且，處在這僧多稀飯（粥）少的辰光，飯最不容易得到，必須要有找飯的本領才行。否則，人家煮好了香噴噴的白米飯，和美味的佳肴，不該它吃的，我們只得望着它，把涎沫向肚子裏嚥。就是運道好，飯碗找到了，他媽的，不供膳，仍得要自己去勞神。尤其，有味道的食品，它就一點不客氣，只管嚼；没味道，或，味道推扳一點的食品，遞給它，對不起，它就馬上不高興，還要皺起眉來，你說它不是個天字第一號的壞蛋嗎？</p>
<p>這末看來，它將我們人，當作奴隷，如同唐僧，將金圈箍到孫行者的頭上，呌我們　都　不了。</p>

<h3 id="c32">高福壽 <a href="#c32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>— 村因</p>
<p>高福壽總是醉洶洶的喝了酒回家的。</p>
<p>臉孔，眼兒……活像一頭垂斃的馴獅！他好像有無限的不平，將從胸隔間怒吼出來，終於又給什麽壓抑着的樣子。</p>
<p>他常常對人們說：</p>
<p>—喝了酒，可以避免去許多狰獰的面目來纒繞！</p>
<p>他的話，有些使人捉摸不到！因爲做劊子手的，决不會怕什麽的哪！</p>
<p>—老高！你殺人也殺慣了的。難道怕這些嗎？</p>
<p>高福壽聽了這話後，頓時發怔起來痛苦而沉苦的說：</p>
<p>—先生！這個你不知道吧。我相信：天下没有眞正肯幹那殺人的勾當的傢伙的！</p>
<p>—老高！那麽你幹嗎要幹這殺人的行業呐？</p>
<p>—是啊！先生。誰不知想放棄這個行業呐！可是放棄了這個，那裏有飯給我找來養活一家五口子呢？</p>
<p>眼珠兒，一絲絲的攀着紅筋！這隻毛茸茸的手，不住的緊揑着。說。</p>
<p>—你曾經殺過多少人啊？</p>
<p>這話，問起了他，使他格外不安起來啦！慢慢地，他很慫恿的說：</p>
<p>—先生！我一共，一共殺過……</p>
<p>他怔住了眼珠，心算着。繼齊又說：</p>
<p>—我一共殺過三十多個人！其中有的是絞死的，有的是殺死的，有的是槍斃的！……唔。先生！你没有知道，那些絞死的人！……他們……如果我仔細想起來！簡直我不願意再看見這世界了！這世界呵……先生！再見！</p>
<p>說着，抱着頭，發狂似的竄去了！</p>
<p>街上面，旁的人見着他的這副模樣兒都笑了，其中有人對我說：</p>
<p>—他不是造孽的人！</p>
<p>—不，他是爲自家兒作福的！因經他殺的全是壞人……</p>
<p>一句句的話，紛紛地傳進我的耳朶裏來。</p>
<p>大約在五個月後，街上面傳說着：</p>
<p>！高福壽死了！</p>
<p>！做劊子手的該死得這樣！</p>
<p>！唔。聽說他自家兒瘋狂的把二顆眼珠挖掉！再咬去了十個手指頭！狂喊着：「我不要再見這世界！我不願再用這雙手去幹這事情！」</p>
<p>！後來怎樣死的？</p>
<p>！後來，後來痛死咯！</p>
<p>在他死後的第五天，我碰到了他的妻子。</p>
<p>—先生！救濟一點我吧！</p>
<p>起初我不認得她是高福壽的妻子，後來她自己說：</p>
<p>—先生！可憐我吧！我的丈夫新近發瘋死去了！剩下來，還有老娘，和三個小孩子………據衙門裏的差事說，可以拿到二十塊的撫恤金！可是只拿到了五塊錢……到今天，到今天還不能安殮他！没有錢啊！先生。啊！巳經發臭了………慈悲一點吧，……</p>
<p>我聽了話，伸手到衣袋裏去摸錢。天哪！只有一塊圓圓的洋錢！完全給了她。！這样，我竟挨餓了三天！</p>
<p>你瞧：不景氣的白雪，掩埋了許多</p>
<p>高福壽的死，差不多各處都穿戴着白的孝服！不過，太陽一出來，這些是將化成水的啊！……</p>
<h3 id="c33">生活的鞭子 <a href="#c33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— 西蒙</p>
<p>日子的積疊殘酷的地刦奪了一切，把我由童年推落到成年的泥犁中，於是我不得不開始嚼着生活的苦計了，我有着一個年靑的身子而又年老的心。在眼前任何一件東西都蒙上一層灰黯的顔色，絲毫不曾使我發生一點興緻，而祇有感到疲倦，無邊的疲倦和無邊的愁苦。</p>
<p>「我還希望什麽呢？」對着擺在面前一幅生活無情的陰冷的臉孔，我時常帶着迭斯底里的口氣自問着。是的，誰說生活的上邊塗着藍的彩色，憧憬的圖面。這些美麗的綫條從來就不會在我腦裏浮出來，我從來亦不曾對它種下幻想的念頭。我祗是知道生活於我，直等於一根失利的皮鞭，天天在抽打着我的背膊。我簡直變成一隻駱駝，變成了一輛車子，負着千斤重的石頭煤塊，讓生活鞭子驅使着，喘着氣，流着汗，在迷茫的無穿盡的暗黑的夜道上走着，天上没有月，也没有屋子，没有濃厚的黑影包圍在四週，我便永遠在黑影的憧憧中荷着重担匍匐着。</p>
<p>這樣地，我漸漸瘦了，瘦得剩下一個皮包骨的空殼子。而生活的鞭子仍然不放鬆的推磨着我。我想休息一下，它却總是叱着我趕路，我没有話說，只能咬着牙根聽它繼續的蹂躪；這樣地，我幾乎連感覺也失掉了，我還相信自己是有靈魂的人麽！我差不多是同於一個没了魂的陰屍了啊！</p>
<p>生活之路掃起來的塵灰儘管一層層的壓着了我的思想。埋蔽了我的眼晴，我瞧不見一切，我光是看見大海的渺茫，憂鬱的天。我除了做生活的牛馬，每天受着苦楚苦躂，此外我得到了什麽呢！我時時在不能入睡的深夜，睜開了眼晴，抓着自己的頭髮；拼命搥着胸膛，甚至於忘記了疼痛用手打着墻壁，不住地向着「生活到底能够給我什麽呢，」可是生活並不理睬我，他的嘴角上老是掛着一個獰惡的冷笑，而到了明天，生活又來逼我，牽我擠進那大臼盤下軋鑠，我於是又忍受着創痛掙扎着，而且一天一天的掙扎下去，啊！我的秋葉一般的身體，我實在再不能支持了，我預備用我最後的殘餘的生命跟生活拼一個死活可是却巳一絲氣力都没有，我惟有巴巴的瞧着生活的魔，把我的和肉一嘴此的呑噬下去啊！………</p>
<h3 id="c34">雅號 <a href="#c34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>— 芥川龍之介著若木譯</p>
<p>雅號也和作品一樣，能將人的個性顯示出來。像菱田春草一樣，在少年時代是呌做駿走。所以少年期的春草大槪是很「駿走」的吧。這話如果是不會錯的，話那麽，正宗白鳥在少年時候，應該呌做白塚了。——是否是呌做白塚，或許是我記憶錯了也未可知，但是，假定是不錯的話，那末，從他這個雅號，便足以推知少年時代的正宗白鳥了。所以，我的意思；以爲古文人底名肩負着許多的雅號，斷不是視雅號像娱樂的玩具一般，而是在適應他們底趣味的進步吧。（澄江堂雜記）</p>
<p>修身</p>
<p>良心是一種嚴肅的趣味。</p>
<p>良心或許曾經製造過道德也未可知；但是，道德却並没有製造過良心的「良」字。</p>
<p>良心是像趣味般一樣，是有着病態的慈愛的成分。但是，病態的慈愛者，十個之中有八九個是屬於聰明的，貴族的，富豪的，這一類的人。（侏儒的話）</p>
<p>多忙</p>
<p>能够將我們從戀愛的毒藪中救援出來的：多忙還比較理性更加有力。要實行戀愛，時間是比較什麽東西更加重要。像被稱爲古代的戀聖的威爾丁，羅美，多里斯托等，他們無一不是閑人。（同上）</p>
<p>男子</p>
<p>從來，男子就是視他的事業還比戀愛更加重要，更可尊重。爾如果疑惑這是非事實的，那麽，就請爾讀讀巴爾塞斯的信吧。巴爾塞斯給韓斯加夫人的信，是曾這樣的寫着：「這信，如果把來拍賣的時候，將會獲得許多的法蘭的稿費。」（同上）</p>
<p>懺悔</p>
<p>古人在神之前懺悔；今人則在社會之前懺悔着。因爲不論誰，不論那樣的東西，——除了阿呆，和惡黨是成爲例外的，——如果是不懺悔，在目前將會感覺非常的痛苦也未可知。</p>
<p>又</p>
<p>雖然不論是怎樣的懺悔着，但，是否能够獲得那樣的信用，這是他自己的事，同時又是成爲另一個問題了。（同上）</p>

<p>Voroshilov's Speech</p>
<p>Smolensk. Before departing for Moscow, Soviet Defense Commissar Voroshilov addressed a crowd of 20,000 people here. He summarized the achievements of military training in Ukraine and Belarus, saying, "Our army's equipment has improved dramatically in recent years. Our army has now become a modern army with the latest scientific and technological achievements. Our air force, tank corps, and mechanized troops are fully capable of handling all their technical tools." Voroshilov addressed factories and collective farms, urging them to serve firmly and cooperate with the Red Army to build a great Soviet state. (TASS dispatch of the 15th)</p>
<p>M. claimed that this result was achieved without the need to levy new taxes or continue to rely on the sacrifices of civil servants and veterans. The preface to the 1935 budget states that the government has resolutely abandoned the ideal of lowering the currency value. France is now beginning to reap the first mature fruits of its frugality. Gold is still flowing into the country, which will loosen finances and provide ample funds for the treasury. The Continent and the world will soon realize that a stable gold-based currency is the only basis for exchange rates and will restore peacetime relations. (Reuters dispatch of the 15th)</p>
<p>Austrian Independence and Autonomy</p>

In conclusion, he said that we have decided not to allow anyone to talk about the annexation of Austria by Germany or similar claims in the future. (Havas dispatch of the 16th)</p>

<p>Australian Election Leans Right</p>
<p>United Australia Party and Country Party</p>
<p>To Form Coalition Government</p>
<p>Melbourne. The results of this general election for the House of Representatives may result in a coalition government between the United Australia Party (the ruling party, led by Prime Minister Lyons) and the Country Party. Although the outcomes of elections in various regions have not been fully announced, it is now possible to predict that the opposition parties to Labor will easily gain a majority. The United Australia Party will remain in power. It is possible that Prime Minister Lyons' party could still defeat the two Labor parties with a small majority. However, it is generally believed here that the United Australia Party seems unlikely to win a majority. If so, a coalition government may need to be formed. The known election results show that the United Australia Party won 28 seats, the Country Party 14 seats, the Federal Labor Party 16 seats, and the Extreme Labor Party 8 seats. Eight seats are still unclear. Although the Communist Party candidates received a significant increase in votes compared to the previous election, they were all defeated.

<p>Oriental Travel Agency</p>
<p>Increases Commission Percentage</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Tongtan: The rumor of reorganization of the Oriental Travel Agency is far from the truth. Due to the small number of passengers traveling to and from the area, the company is incurring losses. According to the contract, the two railway bureaus should subsidize the agency in full. The reason for the delay in the settlement of ticket prices by the two railway bureaus is that the collection of ticket sales reports from various stations along the line takes time. The monthly settlement can be made next month. (Special dispatch of the 16th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Oriental Travel Agency has been established for more than three months, with a monthly income of about 90,000. The 5% commission distributed to the agency is only 4,500 yuan, while the expenses require 14,000 yuan, resulting in a significant loss. According to the contract, the Beining Railway Bureau will pay the full amount. To alleviate the difficulties, the commission percentage will be increased.

More than 30 villages, including Liuzongpu, Lihuzhuang, Daguanzhan, and Xiaoguanzhan, were flooded.

<p>Ministry of Finance Bans</p>
<p>The Problem of Standard Gold Speculation</p>
<p>Expert Chen Changheng's Talk</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance restricts foreign exchange and bans standard gold speculation. Expert Chen Changheng said, "The Ministry of Finance's banning of standard gold and foreign exchange speculation is to stabilize the market and prevent market manipulation. Our country's foreign trade has always been in deficit. Foreign exchange is unavoidable. Legal normal business and travel expenses or other private needs should not be restricted. At the same time, in order to avoid the risk of fluctuations, banks purchase an equivalent amount of gold bars from the standard gold market based on the number of bills of exchange issued to settle prices. Now that standard gold speculation is prohibited, the price of standard gold is relatively stable. But in fact, due to extraterritoriality, only Chinese merchants can be prohibited from speculation, not foreign merchants. As for foreign exchange, only Chinese merchants can be restricted. At the same time, domestic exchange cannot be controlled. In this way, mainland or overseas Chinese merchants can still transfer money to foreign banks and remit it abroad. The United States is buying silver to implement a policy of currency expansion. Our country is a silver-using country and is naturally affected. From an optimistic perspective, there is no major problem at present. From a pessimistic perspective, the future is worrying. As for remedial measures, if we seek to ban the export of silver, it may not be possible. There are many foreign banks in our country. They have their own discretion over the entry and exit of silver. If we ban Chinese people from exporting silver, it will only create opportunities for foreign merchants to manipulate the market. Furthermore, silver stored in our mainland is always transferred to Shanghai and deposited in foreign banks, even if it costs 40% of the discount. This phenomenon is disheartening. Some say that banning the export of silver is not helpful, and that adopting a negative policy and increasing the silver export tax is also a way to prevent and rescue the situation. However, the increase in the tax rate must be transferred according to the international market price of silver. If the export of domestic silver increases the original export tax, its cost will exceed the foreign silver price. In this way, although silver exports can be reduced, domestic prices will indeed fall, which must also be considered. Weighing the facts, increasing the silver tax is not the best policy. For now, considering our country's existing silver reserves and annual trade deficit, it is necessary to control silver. (Special dispatch of the 16th)</p>

<h3 id="e2">A Glimpse of the British Economic Situation (Correspondence from the UK) <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Budget Surplus</p>
<p>Unemployment Gradually Increasing</p>
<p>Britain is also in a de facto state of emergency. We know that Britain's political structure is the most democratic in the world, and its parliamentary politics are the most active. The general public also has a deep understanding of the meaning of politics. Although most people tend to be stable and conservative, they are unwilling to go against the world trend and reverse course. Therefore, since the economic crisis in the United States in 1929, Britain has first abandoned its throne as the world's financial leader and implemented a suspension of the gold standard system to seek domestic economic stability and economic balance between its dominions, colonies, and mainland. After the Ottawa Imperial Economic Conference, this tendency became more pronounced, and its gradual departure from democratic politics and liberalism became increasingly evident.</p>
<p>The current British political situation is truly an unprecedented "national consensus." The past reality of two major parties alternating in power is no longer seen. Instead, a coalition cabinet jointly manages national affairs in order to overcome the current economic panic, bridge political gaps, prevent the centrifugal movements of various dominions and colonies from going off track, and prevent diplomatic contradictions from expanding too much. They are working very hard at this. In short, Britain today wants to maintain the status quo at home, deal with Japan in the Far East, and maneuver with the Soviet Union in Central Asia, while also consolidating the Persian oil fields and its rule in India. It also seeks to prevent France from becoming too powerful in Europe, lest it undermine British authority. This is Britain's greatest ambition.</p>
<p>What is the actual effect of these efforts? We can observe it from the financial perspective. Britain's budget from 1934 to 1935 showed expenditures of 698 million pounds, while revenues amounted to 727 million pounds. With revenues exceeding expenditures by 29 million pounds, this is noteworthy. Since last year, major countries around the world have been plagued by the panic of fiscal imbalance. Britain's ability to achieve such results cannot but be attributed to the efforts of political skill and the achievements of the national unity cabinet. Furthermore, of this 72.9 million pounds of national treasury revenue, 68.8 million pounds are mostly tax revenues, while non-tax revenues are only 39 million pounds. This 39 million pounds does not include any revenue from public bonds, because in recent times, the British financial community has clearly understood that issuing public bonds does not benefit the national treasury.</p>
<p>Therefore, Britain is now making every effort to increase taxes. We remember that in 1914, during the Great War, Britain's tax revenue was only 170 million pounds, but now it has increased fourfold. From this increase in taxes, we can also see that Britain's liberal capitalist organization has gradually changed. As nationalism becomes more distinct, the meaning of controlled economy naturally emerges.</p>
<p>According to the "Economic Journal," the general economic situation in Britain shows a wholesale price index, with September 1931 as the base, of 108.3 in May of this year, 108.1 in June, and 109.5 in July. It has gradually risen and is trending towards a stable path. However, the tonnage of merchant ships this year decreased by more than 400,000 tons compared to June of last year, but this is the impact of the world economic panic. Britain is still considered relatively good.</p>
<p>The general social picture does not yet show any signs of improvement. For example, the number of unemployed people has gradually decreased since January of this year, seemingly indicating an improving trend. However, in June, the number of registered unemployed people increased again. June saw an increase of 27,000 people compared to May, with a total of 2,124,000 unemployed. The reason for the increase is that the number of unemployed coal miners increased by 65,000, the wool textile industry increased by 12,000, and the number of unemployed tailors increased by 9,000. Most other industries saw increased employment. Therefore, some say that this is a seasonal relationship and is not enough to serve as a judgment of the decline of British industry.</p>
<p>Since the spring of this year, the economic sector has indeed shown a declining situation, but in June, the industrial activity index (with 1924 as the base) rose from 107.7 in April to 110.2. This is the highest index since 1930, but whether it has permanence is indeed questionable. Looking at the increase in the number of unemployed, it is impossible to be too optimistic.

<p>Guangdong Province</p>
<p>Issuing Treasury Bills</p>
<p>Total Amount of 2 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence. The Guangdong Provincial Government recently issued short-term financial treasury bills of the Republic of China, 23rd year, totaling 2 million yuan, with the provincial treasury's revenue from the provincial business tax and deed tax as collateral. The Guangdong Provincial Bank is responsible for soliciting subscriptions. From the date of issuance, the first month is the issuance period, and from the third month, the principal and interest are repaid in equal installments over three months. The order is determined by lottery. The lottery date is set on the last day of the third, fourth, and fifth months to repay the principal and interest. Guangdong Provincial Bank cash vouchers are designated for payment. The treasury bills are set at a monthly interest rate of one cent, that is, each silver hundred yuan yields three yuan in interest. Starting from the first day of the third month after issuance, the Finance Department will allocate 25,000 yuan daily from the business tax and deed tax revenue until the end of the month, allocating the full amount of principal and interest due for that month. The treasury bills are divided into four types: 100 yuan, 50 yuan, 10 yuan, and 5 yuan. However, part of the 5 yuan bills are divided into five parts in order to distribute odd amounts. It is decided to issue them on September 10. The treasury bills are in bearer form. All commercial banks, silver shops, and miscellaneous shops may distribute them in accordance with the regulations. The current issuance will collect funds at a 98% discount to the face value. When repaying the principal and interest in the future, the Provincial Bank will pay with silver dollars converted from the provincial vouchers allocated by the Finance Department. During the issuance period, underwriters of treasury bills with a face value of more than 1,000 yuan will be specially authorized by the Provincial Bank to be treated as distributors, paying funds and receiving vouchers at a 93% discount. The distribution period for treasury bills is from September 10 to October 9. Yesterday, the Provincial Bank officially announced the issuance regulations and distribution methods to all sectors.

<p>New Life Movement Association</p>
<p>Intensifying Efforts</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence. Since its reorganization and establishment, the Nanchang New Life Movement Association has moved from verbal or active propaganda to practical and concrete implementation. Due to the enthusiasm and perseverance of the organizers, this implementation has recently achieved remarkable results in various aspects of Nanchang. Therefore, the work is becoming increasingly tense, and people from all walks of life who come here to visit are also constantly coming. Yesterday, the reporter interviewed the local New Life Movement authorities and learned about the various situations in great detail, and specially recorded them in detail as follows:</p>
<p>The Nanchang New Life Movement implementation work is based on the idea of ​​starting near and moving far, focusing on Nanchang City and the Nansun Road areas. It first starts with the "order" and "cleanliness" movements in organizations, groups, public places, and transportation arteries, and then extends to families and individuals. The methods are divided into three types: persuasion, inspection, and competition. The scope of implementation in Nanchang City includes streets, train stations, wharves, theaters, parks, schools, public offices, people's organizations, factories, hotels, restaurants, bathhouses, barbershops, and other stores. On Nansun Road, it includes train stations, trains, ferries, and wharves. For the convenience of work, various methods such as division by district, industry, category, and period are adopted. At the same time, the military police are requested to provide assistance. Since the start of the work, various organizations have been actively launched: (1) Youth Holiday Service Corps. This corps was originally organized by the Education Department and later transferred to the jurisdiction of the association. During the holidays, young students in the province are divided into districts and groups to provide services. The city is divided into ten districts, with more than 200 groups, and three directly affiliated teams. The heads of each district are the principals of each school, and the captains of the directly affiliated teams are also appointed by the association. Each district group is assigned a section by the association and provides services on a daily and punctual basis under the leadership of the group leader. The first directly affiliated team regularly provides services on Nansun Road. The second directly affiliated team selects young people from various schools to specialize in serving important transportation areas such as train stations and wharves. The third directly affiliated team consists of students from the Special Education Teacher Training Institute and serves in hotels, restaurants, and various public entertainment venues. (2) Store Service Personnel. Each store designates one person as a service person, who, in addition to serving inside the store, also pays attention to the hygiene and order of the sidewalk, road, or street in front of the store. After the association convened the executive and supervisory committees of the Nanchang City Chamber of Commerce and the responsible persons of various trade associations three times, all the detailed measures were completely decided. On the one hand, the service regulations were passed, and on the other hand, the association created the style of armband and distributed them to each service person to wear for service, and explained the various misunderstandings from the outside, such as saying that the service person is a soldier, will be negligent in his own business in the future, and has no respect for the shop owner, etc. Now, each industry has complied with the regulations and enthusiastically reported the names of the service personnel to the association. In the future, each of the more than 9,000 stores in the city will have a New Life Movement cell, and the performance of its results will be considerable. (3) Service Personnel of Various Agencies. The heads of each agency select a number of employees who are enthusiastic about the New Life Movement to serve as service personnel. In addition to serving in each agency, they are also responsible for promoting a new life at home for their colleagues. (4) Women's Service Corps. Organized by employed intellectual women to guide family improvement and assist in rescuing women and children. (5) Amateur Service Corps. All freelance professionals voluntarily participate in the service in their spare time and are organized by the association to serve on streets, wharves, train stations, and vegetable markets. The above three, four, and five types of organizations are currently being actively launched, so that they can be realized step by step. Now, most primary and secondary schools in the city have started classes. The association has changed the Youth Service Corps into a permanent organization and decided on five principles: 1. Continue to implement training; 2. Expand the number of members; 3. Strictly organize the service corps; 4. Change its scope of service; 5. Shorten its service time. This was decided at the joint meeting of the heads of each district and the captains of the directly affiliated teams convened in recent days. In addition, the association has decided on various aspects of the implementation work within this month, including: 1. Completing 200 to 1,000 standard families and holding a public exhibition; 2. Promoting a new life in factories; 3. Expanding the organization of various members and providing training; 4. A combined general mobilization and regular general inspection; 5. Holding a new life competition among various service team members, various agencies, groups, schools, stores, and public places to thoroughly check past work and promote future work. In short, the atmosphere in all aspects is very active and tense, full of vigor, and there is enough for other places to emulate. (September 13)</p>
<p>Ringleader Luo Binghui Injured in Qingyuan Battle</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence. Military news. According to captured bandits, the recent intrusion into Qingyuan was carried out by the troops of the pseudo-Seventh Army Corps Commander Luo Binghui, a total of three regiments, with more than 1,000 people in each regiment, totaling more than 2,000 guns and more than 40 light machine guns. They captured the forward position of Zhukou in Rixiang and engaged in fierce fighting with the Zhejiang Security Regiment. The bandits suffered more than 800 casualties, with two battalion commanders and seven company commanders killed. The pseudo-corps commander was shot in the right forearm and was carried away on a stretcher with the army. The bandit Luo is less than five feet tall and has a thin appearance. It is said that the bandits suffered heavy losses in this battle.</p>
<p>Also, news. Refugees who escaped from the Jiangkou area said that after the National Army's various routes of suppression, the bandits have become turtles in a jar. Now, the bandits are coercing elderly men and women to organize the Red Guards, hoping to make a final struggle and prolong their lives. In the Jiangkou area, because there are no able-bodied men to draw, elderly men and women between the ages of 40 and 60 are coerced to form the Red Guards, and now 500 to 600 people have been assigned to be driven by the Red bandits. The Jiangkou Pseudo-Trade Bureau still exists, with the pseudo-director being Li Hongqiu, and the bureau address is located in the Guangyu Feng store there. The Jiangkou Pseudo-District Government is located at the Jiangkou Wharf, and the pseudo-chairman is Lai. The bandits in Xingguo Gaoxing Market recently resisted the National Army for three or four days. The bandits suffered a miserable defeat, with corpses piled up. The bandit corpses near Gaoxing Market were exposed, and the stench traveled for several miles. The National Army is now building fortresses in the Libu section, handling village clearance, and sending teams to advance on guerrillas, and so on. (September 15)</p>
<p>Songjiang</p>
<p>The Defense Force Will Be Reorganized Again</p>
<p>After the county defense force was reorganized into two platoons with two squads, the self-defense corps in Fengjing, Tinglin, Tianmashan, Sijing, Xinzhuang and other places were also reorganized into squads. The salaries were still collected and supplied by local communities to protect the area. Except for the squad in Fengjing, which has been disbanded, all the defense forces in Tinglin and other four places have been reorganized into two squads and maintained as before. Now, it is learned that the Provincial Security Department has sent news of a comprehensive reorganization. The original First Platoon in the county has an insufficient number of people. It is planned to use the Second Platoon as the First Platoon and the original First Platoon as the Second Platoon. However, the Provincial Government believes that the local donations for the squads in Tinglin and other places are inappropriate and has sent news of their abolition. Therefore, the general captain Shen Bangda went to the province and personally visited Director Xiang of the Security Department, stating that the four major towns in the county had all been robbed by bandits in the past. Local communities are happy to contribute to the defense force to suppress the area, and requested permission to maintain the status quo. It is heard that Director Xiang ordered Captain Shen to return to Songjiang, convene representatives from various places to hold a meeting, discuss whether the squads in various places should exist, and the issue of salaries, etc., and submit it to the Provincial Government for approval before they can be maintained. Therefore, Captain Shen plans to convene local figures to discuss before the reorganization.</p>

<p>Luxingbang Robbery Injures People</p>
<p>Last night at midnight, five or six bandits suddenly came to the Luxingbang area of Yuyao, speaking in mixed accents, carrying electric torches and quick-firing weapons. They opened the gate of the house of Jin Huisheng, a farmer from Shaoxing, and warned him not to make any noise. They overturned boxes and cabinets and carried out a rampant robbery. A farmhand, Wang, took the opportunity to report to the Zhenjiang police regiment, but was spotted by a bandit guarding the room, who grabbed him and beat him severely, causing serious injuries. After the bandits obtained the loot, they fled eastward.</p>
<p>Rice Shop Partner Drowns Himself</p>
<p>Pan Xuesun from Yuyao was a partner in the Xietai Hing rice shop in Zhujing. In the autumn of last year, he suddenly suffered from anal malaria. After a hundred ways of treatment, he finally recovered a little. Therefore, he was absent from work for half a year. When he came to the store this spring, his body had not yet recovered, and he was lazy to work. The shop owner was quite annoyed with Pan, but Pan was always depressed. In addition, his anal malaria recurred, and he was economically strapped and unable to seek further treatment. Therefore, on the night of the 13th, he secretly went to the wooden raft and jumped into the clear stream to commit suicide.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>National Goods Commercial Center Postpones Opening</p>
<p>The Suzhou National Goods Commercial Center, initiated and founded by Shi Junqing, chairman of the Suzhou Chamber of Commerce, raised more than 200,000 yuan and built a three-story building in the Beiju area, which is about to be completed. It was originally scheduled to open on the first day of the national calendar. However, due to the unresolved issue of renting stores, the opening on the first day of the national calendar is impossible. It may be postponed to the first day of the lunar calendar. The building has more than 500 rooms. Stores are opened on the first and second floors, and the remaining rooms are used to open a national goods paradise. However, the paradise is not run by the company, but is also open to merchants. It is currently in negotiations.</p>
<p>The Corruption Case of the Farmland Tax Is Resolved Vaguely</p>
<p>The Wuxian Farmland Tax Corruption Case, which has attracted attention from all sides, was investigated secretly by Dong Binqian, dispatched by the Finance Department. The case is generally clear. There are indeed problems with the privately collected and farmer-owed parts. However, the fault of the private collection does not lie with the director of the farmland tax, but with the registrar's office and the various map makers who colluded to commit fraud. Therefore, the registrar's office manager Qian Zhonghua was taken into custody. In the part owed by the farmers, it was found that Feng Sisushang owed thousands of gold in grain over the years. As for the part of wasteland reclamation, whether there are any corrupt practices, because there are more than 1,000 books of records, it is particularly difficult to check. If you want to thoroughly investigate, it will take more than three or four months. Committee member Dong believes that the private collection involves hundreds of people. Investigating each one will require a major prison sentence. Therefore, he left Suzhou a few days ago to report to Director Zhao of the Finance Department and ask for instructions. Director Zhao immediately summoned the Wuxian County Chief to the province the day before yesterday to discuss countermeasures together. Now the Wuxian County Chief has returned to Suzhou, and Committee member Dong must also come to Suzhou today or tomorrow to handle the conclusion matters. According to rumors, in addition to punishing Qian Zhonghua, others will not be pursued, and it will be resolved vaguely.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Smoking Without a License Will Be Dealt With by Military Law</p>
<p>The County Anti-Smoking Committee has drawn lots to determine the location of opium dens and sales points in urban and rural areas. In recent days, the County Committee has ordered its subordinates to seriously handle the guarantee matters. Yesterday, the committee held another ad hoc meeting and decided: (1) According to the instructions of the Provincial Anti-Smoking Committee, each district should set up one opium den. However, in districts with a large number of smokers, it seems insufficient to supply the demand. It is allowed to make changes and add more, with two additional dens in the first district, one in the third district, and one in the eighth district. (2) Committee member Cheng was elected to verify the signing, and committee members Qian, Li, and Chen drew lots, Secretary Yao recorded the books, and Section Chief Hua counted the signs. The lottery results were: Ding Chanming "Yuanji" and Lian Tang "Yonglong" in the first district, Zhu Yuan "Youli" in the third district, and Qian Yingzhang "Dada" in the eighth district. (3) The County Committee originally planned to have one opium den in the urban area. Now, after adding two more, there are a total of three. The committee also drew lots to determine the location of each den. The location is in the city center, with Ding Chanming in Nanmen and Lian Tang outside Guangfumen. At the same time, the committee felt deeply sorry that the registration of smokers in the county was still waiting and seeing, hoping to hide. Yesterday, it specially listed the following articles as a final warning: (1) Those who are addicted but have not registered or reported their intention to quit will be immediately detained and forced to register. (2) After the registration period expires at the end of September, there will be absolutely no extension. From October 1, smoking without a license will be dealt with by military law. (3) Those who report smoking without a license and are found to be true will be rewarded with a bonus of up to 100 yuan. The bonus will be borne by the smoker. However, those who make false accusations will be punished in reverse according to military law. (4) Those who do not want to register and obtain a license to smoke again must report to quit. Those who quit on their own must also register their names. Otherwise, once discovered, it will be difficult to distinguish between jade and stone, and the stakes are huge. (5) Those who have not applied for registration in the surveyed areas must quickly go to the committee in the urban area to apply for registration. Those who are willing to register in advance in the unsurveyed areas can also go to the committee to apply for registration in advance to avoid missing the opportunity. (6) If people who are not laborers or poor people fraudulently obtain a Class B license, they must still exchange it for a license and pay the fee. (7) The smoking cessation license is only for the personal use of the holder and may not be shared by a household or lent to others. In particular, the license may not be used to lure or protect others to smoke. If there is any violation, in addition to canceling the holder's registration, it will be dealt with according to military law.</p>
<p>Changzhou</p>
<p>Bandit Leader Ren Haoming Escorted to Changzhou</p>
<p>Bandit leader Ren Haoming of Wuyi County has committed numerous crimes and has been wanted. The bandit was hiding in Shanghai and has not been captured. However, he was recently arrested in Shanghai for another case and sent to the First Special District Court. The Wujin County Government heard the news and immediately sent personnel to escort him back. However, due to issues such as procedures and documents, the escort to Changzhou was delayed. The county government received an official letter from the First Special District Court of Shanghai the day before yesterday, requesting to send personnel to escort him back. It immediately sent Detective Captain Ni Gusheng, detective Hu Shaoqing, and four security team members to Shanghai on the 15th. After submitting the official documents to the Special Court, the court handed the bandit Ren over to Captain Ni to take back. They then boarded the express train at 1:06 pm and escorted him to Changzhou. When they left Shanghai, they were escorted by detectives from the Chinese and French Concessions. When the train arrived at Changzhou Station, the entire detective team was present at the station to take care of it, in order to prevent accidents.</p>
<p>Nantong</p>
<p>Searching for Smokers House by House</p>
<p>Nantong is forcing smokers to register. Starting from the 16th, all agencies in the county mobilized and searched for smokers house by house. The county's opium shops have been contracted. Yu Tian, the director of the Tongzhou Anti-Smoking Office, has arrived in Tongzhou, and a large amount of official opium will be transported there within days.</p>

<p>The Civil Affairs Department Severely Punishes the Illegal District Chief</p>
<p>Yuan Zixin, the district chief of the Third District of Jurong, was accused of using his authority to impose fines and embezzle funds during his tenure as the district chief of the Fifth District. The Civil Affairs Department ordered the county chief of the county to investigate. Subsequently, the citizens of the Fifth District of the county also filed complaints with the Civil Affairs Department. The Civil Affairs Department found that the district chief had been repeatedly fined arbitrarily and sent personnel to investigate the case in detail. According to the investigation, the district chief repeatedly imposed fines without authorization. All the victims and witnesses issued signed statements. The Civil Affairs Department found that the district chief was indeed suspected of illegally imposing fines and secretly ordered the county chief to dismiss the district chief and send him to the province for disposal. It is reported that the county has sent him to the province and transferred him to the Procuratorate of the Zhenjiang District Court for interrogation according to law.</p>
<p>Yangzhou</p>
<p>The Dispute Over the Northern Migration of Huai Salt</p>
<p>The county's various legal groups, because the Jinan Seven Companies were ordered by the Lianghuai Transportation Envoy to move north, which concerns the commercial safety of Yangcheng, organized a Joint Association for Maintaining the Salt Industry to discuss countermeasures. On one hand, the county party headquarters, led by the Party Secretary, sent a telegram to Transportation Envoy Miao, requesting him to withdraw the order. It is learned that the county party headquarters received a reply from Miao yesterday, which stated that the telegram had been read. After investigating the previous order from the Ministry of Finance, the seven companies in Jinan should focus on salt production, and the center of gravity should be in Yuxia. However, the center of gravity for issuing orders by the seven companies is still in Yangzhou, which has caused a lack of coordination in the matters that should be promoted and reformed in Yuxia. This is detrimental to the future of rectification and should be promptly advised to quickly shift the center of gravity in order to be able to handle matters under the official government at any time and increase efficiency. It has been repeatedly ordered to comply with the record. This time, the time limit was set for the seven companies to move the headquarters to Banpu or Chenjiagang, which was originally to execute the Ministry's order. I don't know what the so-called destruction of established rules in the telegram refers to. The matter concerns the order of the Ministry, so there is no need to discuss the request to withdraw the order. I hope to explain to all sectors that they must not obstruct important government affairs. If incidents occur as a result, all responsibilities shall be borne by the various legal groups, and so on. The county party headquarters received the telegram and immediately notified the Maintenance Association and various legal groups. The association has scheduled the third executive committee meeting to be held at the county party headquarters at 5:00 pm today (16th). All executives have been notified and are expected to attend. Also, since receiving the northern migration order, the Dayuan Company has been actively preparing for several days. Because Banpu is close to the Transportation Office, but the transportation is quite inconvenient, it has established a Pu branch in Xinpu and hired Fang Hanzhang, the secretary of the Transportation Office, as the manager. Although the name of the Yangzhou headquarters still exists, it has actually become a liaison office. This is used to ease the atmosphere in Yangzhou. The other six companies will also follow suit in order.</p>
<p>National Exhibition to Hold Lantern Parade</p>
<p>The Jiangdu National Goods Exhibition, in order to expand publicity and make the public aware of national goods, will hold a lantern parade for two days starting tonight (16th). More than 80 manufacturers will participate, and more than a thousand lanterns of different styles will be set up.</p>

<p>Road Police and Worker Conflict Case</p>
<p>The road workers of Xishiqiao, Chengwu Section, Zhencheng Road, had a conflict with the subordinates of Zhu Hui, platoon leader of the 12th Company of the 3rd Battalion of the 3rd Regiment of the Provincial Security Department, due to the purchase of rice straw. Because there were few road workers, the platoon leader happened to be out when the incident occurred. The soldiers, armed with guns, rushed to the Mengjia Ancestral Hall where the workers lived and surrounded it. They opened fire with rifles, injuring four workers and scaring two elementary school students. Currently, worker Zhao Zhengcai's life is in danger. After the incident, Yu Wanyi, the foreman of the section, went to Beijing for business. Huo Qingxiang, the manager of Jianxing Company (not the foreman), telegraphed him to return to Cheng to handle the aftermath because the foreman was not there. Yesterday (10th), platoon leader Zhu talked to Manager Huo, requesting a peaceful resolution, but it has not been allowed.</p>
<p>Ningbo</p>
<p>Kidnapping Case Occurs in Yujiatai</p>
<p>Yu Huigen, a resident of Yujiatai in Yinnan, is about thirty years old and has a well-off family. This has aroused the covetousness of petty thieves. Last (14th) night at 12:00, more than 20 bandits suddenly came, each with a pistol, to Yu Huigen's house, broke down the door and kidnapped Yu southward.</p>
<p>Wanshou Temple Robbery Injures People</p>
<p>Zhang Dayao, a resident near Wanshou Temple in the Fifth District of Yuyao, is usually diligent and thrifty and has some savings. Yesterday was the day for his eldest daughter to be engaged, and he had received engagement money, which aroused the covetousness of bandits. At night, four bandits suddenly came and twisted Dayao, forcing him to hand over the bank. Dayao refused and was beaten severely by the bandits. He had no choice but to order his mother to take out 70 yuan from under the floor and hand it over to the bandits. Seeing this, the bandits rushed to search and rob, and robbed more than 500 yuan in foreign currency for about an hour. After robbing, they roared away. Later, the basic team was reported and arrested a suspect, Wu Jinbiao, nearby. They immediately interrogated him with the team.</p>

<p>Private Receipt of Stolen Goods Case</p>
<p>Case: Fu Rong Privately Received 300 Dozen Rasps</p>
<p>The Thief Has Been Punished, Qin Is Also Being Prosecuted</p>
<p>The Mantingfang area on Wuma Road has always been known for receiving stolen goods for profit. Qin Furong also opened Qin Fuxing Hardware Store in the area, building his business by receiving stolen goods and accumulating tens of thousands of gold, yet he did not cease his activities. In August of this year, Zhang Binggen, a native of Yuyao and employee of De Taicheng Hardware Store at No. 181 Henan Road, stole 600 dozen rasps from the store, worth three to four thousand yuan. Three hundred dozen of these stolen goods were directly sold cheaply to Qin Fuxing at a price of three yuan per dozen. After some time, Yu Wenbiao, the assistant manager of De Taicheng Store, found out and reported it to the police. Zhang Binggen was arrested and sent to the criminal court of the First Special District Court. After interrogation, he was sentenced to three months in prison. The detectives investigated the stolen goods at Qin's place. Qin claimed that Zhang had peddled 20 dozen, but 10 dozen had already been sold. Therefore, the court was requested to issue a summons. The case was heard yesterday morning by Judge Deng Baosen of the Second Criminal Court. Qin Furong hired lawyer Fan Gang to represent him. First, lawyer Qian Xunjiu, representing the police, stated the facts of the case and prosecuted him for receiving stolen goods. Then, Zhang Binggen was brought from the Western Prison for questioning. According to his confession, he had stolen and sold 300 dozen rasps to Qin Furong from April to August, at a price of three yuan per dozen. Next, Yu Jiaobiao testified that the rasps were exclusively sold by their store and had a secret mark. The purchase price was over six yuan per dozen, and the defendant Qin Furong had come to the store to buy them in bulk. Lawyer E Sen was also hired, claiming compensation for the losses, which should be calculated based on 300 dozen. When questioned, Qin Furong's testimony was evasive. Judge Deng ruled that further investigation was necessary and ordered a rescheduling for further verification on the morning of the 18th.</p>
<p>Lin Shaozhang's Bigamy Case</p>
<p>Appeal After Sentencing</p>
<p>The Third Branch of the High Court Held a Trial the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>The Case Still Requires Investigation</p>
<p>Lin Shaozhang, a Ningbo native residing at No. 35 Hongfuli, Dengtu Road, Public Concession, is 46 years old this year. He has been diligently engaged in business over the years and has accumulated some wealth. He had only one son, named Weixian, who unfortunately died of illness in the early summer of last year. Because of his eagerness to have a son, he disliked his wife Zhang's old age and inability to bear children. Therefore, in early July of this year, through a matchmaker, he married Zhao Shuiying, a Suzhou woman (21 years old this year), as a concubine. Initially, the matchmakers concealed the truth from Zhao, saying it was a "round string." Then, a formal wedding ceremony was held at No. 26 Yongchengli, Xujiahui Road, French Concession. After living together for a short time, they moved around. Lin, in order to save expenses, moved Zhao to No. 36 Hongfuli, next door to his own residence. Unexpectedly, Lin's wife Zhang became jealous and often went to Zhao's place to make trouble and quarrel. Zhao then learned that Lin still had a wife. Lin, unable to bear his wife's harassment, stopped visiting his concubine, and ignored Zhao's daily necessities. Zhao, at this point, believed that Lin had committed bigamy and abandonment. Since Lin's marriage and crime took place in the French Concession, Zhao reported it to the French police on June 26th of this year. The police dispatched detectives to cooperate with the Public Concession police to arrest Lin and bring him to the Second Special District Court. The police lawyer filed a public prosecution against Lin for bigamy. After summoning the matchmakers and witnesses to court, the trial concluded, and Lin Shaozhang was found guilty of bigamy and sentenced to four months of imprisonment. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that Lin did not accept the judgment and filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The High Court accepted the appeal and, the day before yesterday, Chief Judge Guo, with the assistance of Judges Sun and Fan, Prosecutor Zhang, specially convened a collegial panel for trial. Because the case still required investigation, the court ordered a postponement for further questioning.</p>
<p>Gaoqiao</p>
<p>Rural Improvement Association Tea Party Record</p>
<p>The Shanghai Gaoqiao Rural Improvement Association held a tea party at 9:00 AM on the 15th at the local Fire Brigade, inviting local elders and leaders from all walks of life. It was a heavy rain, but the number of participants did not decrease as a result. Attendees included Ding Fengshan, Ding Rusong, Zhong Yuliang, Zhan Chun, Lan Zhusan, Lai Douyan, Huang Zhicheng, Chen Yuru, Xu Bingzhang, Cai Zhiyuan, and others, totaling 27 people. After ringing the bell, the meeting began as scheduled. First, Chairman Du Yuesheng delegated Wang Kuiying to report, saying: "Elders, leaders, Chairman Du Yuesheng was originally going to personally preside over everything at today's reception, but due to being busy, he had to notify me to temporarily represent him and say a few words. Regarding the initiation and preparation, internal organization, and work plan of the Gaoqiao Rural Improvement Association, there are printed materials here, and everyone can take a copy to read. There is no need for me to elaborate. Today, I want to say a few words that are not in the printed materials. That is, why does Chairman Du Yuesheng spend money and effort to initiate and organize this association? Why do my colleagues and I, and all the interns, come here to do rural improvement work? The first reason for Chairman Du Yuesheng's initiation and organization is the most obvious, because this is his hometown. Patriotism must start with loving the hometown. The second reason is that China is founded on agriculture, and in the past one or two years, rural bankruptcy and continuous disasters have affected the sluggishness of the city, causing various construction projects in politics, economy, and culture to stagnate invisibly. If we don't start with the countryside, we can't talk about so-called production and construction. The third reason is that Chairman Du Yuesheng deeply believes that the people of Gaoqiao have always been enthusiastic about public welfare and have achieved good results in the past. Public security, hygiene, and education have also made great progress. With the Improvement Association here, we will surely receive the assistance and guidance of all elders and leaders. I hope that in a few years, Gaoqiao can become a model autonomous region, so that nearby places and all parts of the country can hear the news and imitate it, forming the backbone force for building China, so that we can gradually realize the highest ideal of the Prime Minister's Three Principles of the People. As for my colleagues and others coming here to work, on the one hand, we are carrying out the purpose of Chairman Du and all the directors and members, and strive to express and implement it. On the other hand, it is also providing us young people with a place to practice patriotism and love for the people. Because my colleagues and others feel that the biggest crisis in our country at present is not only the aggression of the great powers and the disturbance of the Communist Party, but also that the general youth have abandoned their basic organization of rural society and are all running to the bustling places of big cities. As a result, cash and all great construction are concentrated in big cities, suffering from a bloated belly, unable to digest, cultivating speculative psychology, extravagant life, and creating all kinds of unimaginable evils. As a result, it is still a perverted and deformed development. According to our experience and belief, unless there are a group of passionate young people, full of the spirit of sacrifice, service, adventure, and struggle, and strive to create a new atmosphere, so that the outstanding young people in the country all take improving rural life as their duty, and they can also develop their personal ambitions without throwing themselves into the bustling cities. Gradually, the idle capital of the cities will slowly be transferred back to the countryside. Not only will the income of farmers increase and their lives become prosperous, but also education, industry, commerce, social undertakings, and political facilities can be universally developed in the countryside. After ten years of accumulating wealth and ten years of education, we can talk about building the country, resisting foreign aggression, and reviving the nation. Although the elders present may not be able to see such a grand occasion, we adults and young people may not necessarily be able to see it in our lifetime. But as the saying goes, "The predecessors planted the trees, and the descendants enjoy the shade." As long as we adhere to the spirit of Jingwei filling the sea and the Old Man moving the mountain, our children and grandchildren will definitely continue our cause, so that our Chinese nation will regain the glory in history. Although our scope of work in Gaoqiao is small, its impact is very large. The colleagues of the office hold a humble attitude of learning and a spirit of dedication to service, and are willing to follow the elders and leaders from all walks of life and strive to accomplish this great undertaking." Next, the cadres and staff were introduced, and Mr. Liu Guofan, a cadre of the Rural Education Department, was invited to speak, saying: "I am from Liaoning in Northeast China, and I have personally tasted the suffering of national subjugation. However, Japanese imperialism is ambitious and wants to annex China every day. Looking back, the reasons why we cannot resist foreign aggression are four: ignorance, weakness, poverty, and selfishness. I think that the way out for China should start from the basic level and thoroughly eradicate the above root causes, that is, improve education, increase productivity, pay attention to personality cultivation, and train unity and cooperation." Finally, he said, "My colleagues and I are weak in ability, and I hope that the local elders and leaders from all walks of life will cooperate and assist." Next, Mr. Zhan Chun, the branch director of the Public Security Bureau, spoke, saying: "The Gaoqiao Rural Improvement Association takes improving the countryside as its duty. If the rural improvement is successful, there will be solutions in economic, educational, and political aspects. The future of the country and the nation can be opened up. China is a whole, so various undertakings should not be divided and demarcated, but should be done with one heart and one mind. If Gaoqiao succeeds, all parts of the country will respond to the news, which will not only benefit one place in Gaoqiao, but also be a blessing to the whole country. If the Public Security Bureau needs help during the rural survey, please notify us by letter, and I will send people to protect it to facilitate the process." Next, Mr. Zhong Yuliang spoke, mainly saying: "Welcome the personnel of the Rural Improvement Association office. At the same time, I feel that the planned plans and steps are very appropriate. Among them, such as the migrant workers' training institute and the public cemetery, are essential things in Gaoqiao. I deeply hope that the gentlemen in the office and the local elders will cooperate and carry them out together." Next, Mr. Lai Douyan spoke, mainly saying: "There are many difficulties in handling health administration, and the economic life of farmers is the most important. Secondly, a career cannot be successful alone. Now that we have comrades, I hope to cooperate, then not only will health be a solution, but other aspects will also be a solution." Next, Mr. Ding Fengshan spoke, mainly saying: "The population of Gaoqiao is not very accurate, especially the farmers in the smaller villages have not yet developed the habit of reporting deaths and marriages, and they often conceal them. Therefore, some bad elements can lurk unnoticed. In the past three months, more than 20 households have been stolen, which hinders public security and cannot be ignored. I intend to organize farmers to implement the Baojia system and select fair people from the local area to serve as village chiefs, preferably with 100 households as a unit, with one person responsible for reporting births and deaths, then bad elements cannot stand and local public security will naturally be peaceful." After the tea party, Mr. Wang Kuiying, the chief director, expressed his thanks and said that in order to solicit opinions, a suggestion box was specially set up, and he asked the elders and leaders from all walks of life to continue to criticize and correct. It was almost 12 o'clock when the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>County Party Department Promotes Cooperative Undertakings</p>
<p>In order to promote cooperative undertakings and develop the rural economy, the Shanghai County Party Department, in conjunction with the Provincial Yutang Mass Education Center, co-organized a training class for cooperative undertaking service personnel, recruiting trainees from various districts of the county and the guidance area of the Yutang Mass Education Center. After completing the course, the results were assessed separately. The course has now ended, with a total of twelve male and female members, including Wang Zhaoyong. The Party Department also believes that promoting cooperative undertakings is the only essential work to revitalize the rural economy. It immediately recorded the list of trainees and sent a letter to the county government. The county government has already ordered the district chiefs to immediately, together with various social education institutions, actively prepare for cooperative undertakings and give priority to employing trainees from the training class to facilitate the process.</p>

<p>Rent Reduction Judgement</p>

<p>Strange Events in Heavy Rain</p>
<p>Snake's Head as Big as a Teacup</p>
<p>Countless Small Holes in the Tree Trunk</p>
<p>Gray Snake Falls from the Sky</p>
<p>The night before last, the city suddenly had a heavy thunderstorm. At around 8:00 PM, a thunderclap was suddenly heard at the intersection of Dongjie College Street, Dadongmen, Shanghai. A large snake fell from mid-air, its body gray, its head the size of a teacup, and its body about six feet long. A crowd of onlookers gathered for a time. When it fell, the snake's eyes were bright and it could still swim. Later, it was beaten to death by passers-by with iron hoes. The snake's body was burned with fire. It is said that it was thrown into the Huangpu River.</p>
<p>Ancient Tree Struck into Three Sections</p>
<p>At 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, the sky was covered with dark clouds and heavy rain poured down. Suddenly, a thunderclap was heard, shaking far and wide. A ball of lightning suddenly fell from the sky, striking an ancient tree on the north side of the Wangjiazhai Stone Bridge on Pusengtang Bridge Road into three sections. The tree fell to the west side of the road, and its last section was pulled up from the ground at the root. Upon closer inspection of the broken part of the tree trunk, countless small holes were found. At that time, nearby residents came to watch. According to someone in the audience, when the big tree fell, they caught a glimpse of a gecko about a foot long jumping out, and then they didn't know where it went. According to the elders there, the tree grew during the Ming Dynasty and has a history of more than 300 years. It is found that the tree has two hugs in circumference, half alive and half dead. There are houses on the east, south, and north sides of the tree. The villagers are amazed that it happened to fall to the west and did not collapse houses or injure people.</p>

<p>Qianji Hotel</p>
<p>A Young Man Was Assassinated Last Night</p>
<p>Claiming to Be Xiong Guohua, He Did Not Go Out All Day Yesterday</p>
<p>Two Thugs Suddenly Arrived and Opened Fire Upon Seeing Him</p>
<p>—All Three Shots Hit Vital Points, Life in Danger—</p>
<p>Young Traveler</p>
<p>At 11:35 last night, a traveler at Qianji Hotel in Huajinli, Sima Road, was suddenly shot. Details are recorded below. Shenji Qianji Hotel at No. 37 Huajinli, Sima Road, received a young traveler wearing a dark gray serge long gown, a felt hat, and leather shoes at around 7:00 AM the day before yesterday (the 15th). He booked Room 34 on the second floor, next to the staircase entrance, at a daily rate of nine dimes and five cents.</p>
<p>Did Not Go Out All Day</p>
<p>Because the hotel saw that the young man was carrying a large suitcase, they did not ask him to pay the room fee in advance. The young man signed his name as Xiong Guohua, 34 years old, from Taizhou, Zhejiang, engaged in the electrical business. He went out once that night and returned to the hotel late at night. After reading various newspapers, he went to sleep. He did not go out all day yesterday.</p>
<p>Sudden Arrival of Thugs</p>
<p>At 11:00 last night, the young man ordered a bowl of shredded pork soup noodles from the waiter. After eating, he read the newspaper again. After the waiter brewed tea and sent it to the room, the young man closed the door and went to bed. Unexpectedly, less than half an hour later, at around 11:30, two thugs wearing black short clothes suddenly came downstairs. They went straight upstairs, reached out and knocked on the door of Room 34, and frequently called out Xiong Guohua's name.</p>
<p>—Three Shots Fired in Succession</p>
<p>Upon hearing the sound, Xiong got out of bed and opened the door. Upon seeing the two men, he did not recognize them. Just as he was about to ask, one of the two thugs suddenly pulled out a gun and fired three shots at Xiong in succession. Because they were so close, all the shots hit. Seeing that their purpose had been achieved, the thugs fled down the stairs in a panic, escaping without a trace.</p>
<p>Only a Glimmer of Life</p>
<p>After Xiong was shot and fell to the ground, blood flowed straight out. At the same time, the hotel waiters all rushed over. But Xiong, except for calling out "Waiter, hurry up," fell to the ground unconscious. The accounting room urgently reported to the police by telephone. The police chief immediately sent Chinese and Western detectives to the scene. After carefully examining the three shots that Xiong was hit by, one was in the mouth, one was in the left neck, and one was in the right chest, they immediately called an ambulance to send Xiong to Renji Hospital, but he only had a glimmer of life left.</p>
<p>Police Investigation</p>
<p>After the police inspected the scene, they brought Xiong's suitcase and the waiter on duty into the police station for investigation. Three shell casings were sent to the gun inspection room for examination. It is not yet known why Xiong was assassinated. The police have already begun to investigate Xiong Guohua's real name and whereabouts in order to arrest the murderer.</p>
<p>Verification of Double Suicide by Male and Female</p>
<p>In Room 520 of a certain hotel on Shanxi Road, there were two young male and female travelers, the man named Tong Jiaju and the woman named Zhao. The day before yesterday, they suddenly had a pessimistic thought and committed suicide by taking a large amount of Lysol and opium. Later, the hotel waiter Zhao Bingquan discovered it and sent the two men and women to Renji Hospital for treatment to no avail. They died one after another. The hospital reported to the General Patrol Room, and the patrolman ordered an investigation. The two bodies were sent to the Forensic Examination Office on Feilun Road for verification. It has been reported in the newspapers. Yesterday, a report was submitted to the First Special District Court, which appointed Prosecutor Tang to visit the office and verify that the bodies were real. It was then determined that the deceased Tong Jiaju, male, and Zhao, female, both died of poisoning before their deaths. In addition to the deceased's belongings temporarily stored in the police station for collection, the bodies were handed over to the Pushan Villa for collection.</p>
<p>Two Groups on Aidoa Road Re-petition</p>
<p>Banning Prostitutes from Standing Around and Causing Disturbances</p>
<p>The Fourteenth Branch of the First Special District Citizens' Association and the Aidoa Road Business Community Association, previously, due to the fact that prostitutes (commonly known as "wild chickens") on Zhengjia Wood Bridge, Dongxin Bridge, and Xizang Road on that road would stand in front of stores as soon as the lights came on at night, pulling people hard, causing passers-by to be afraid of them, resulting in customers of various stores not coming and avoiding them, causing business losses. The association had previously sent a letter to the Public Works Bureau requesting a ban. As a result, the prostitutes on various roads disappeared for several days, not daring to stand out to solicit customers until late at night. Unexpectedly, recently, the police have been a little negligent in catching them, and a group of prostitutes has relapsed, standing as before, pulling and dragging hard, and rampant as before. Therefore, the association yesterday sent another letter to the Bureau of Public Works' Director Zhong, requesting attention and a fundamental ban. The letter stated, "Respectfully, the rampant situation of prostitutes on Aidoa Road, Zhengjia Wood Bridge, and Xizang Road was described in detail to your bureau by our association on September 1st, requesting a ban. We were pleased to have received instructions to handle the matter. Our association and various stores are deeply grateful and celebrating that we can get rid of the stains from now on in order to maintain the business in the store. Unexpectedly, the fact is very different. Since the 14th of this month, prostitutes have been standing on the street and pulling hard, just like before, no less than before. If they are caught, they will hide, and if they are not caught, they will not avoid it. This is not a proper solution. Your bureau should pay more attention and investigate the points mentioned in the previous letter. Strictly order the brothels to move to secluded places to remove the roots. At the very least, they should be prohibited from standing in front of stores. Otherwise, please send several plainclothes officers to patrol and arrest them every night to eliminate the traces of prostitutes, maintain commerce, and reassure customers. This is addressed to the Bureau of Public Works' Director Zhong."</p>
<p>Seven Districts in a Row Crack Red Pill Cases</p>
<p>Yao Guangnai, the chief of the Seventh District of the Wusong Public Security Bureau, found out that someone was privately selling red pills at the entrance of Guihua Lane in the territory. He immediately secretly dispatched team leader Xin Jingsheng, detective Gu Yousan, etc. to arrest Chen Guixiang at around noon the day before yesterday. After questioning him in the district, Chen confessed that he had bought them from Li Zelin and Niu Zhongyi at No. 46 Yiyuanli in the town. The police were dispatched to arrest them. Li Zelin had already fled, and only Niu Zhongyi was arrested. Niu confessed that he had purchased them from Niu Aqing at No. 60 Dong Wangjiazhai, Yangshupu, Shanghai. Detectives were sent with a letter to arrest Niu Aqing, but he was nowhere to be found. Yesterday, the arrested criminals Chen Guixiang and Niu Zhongyi were sent to the General Bureau along with the seized red pills and other stolen goods for legal action.</p>

<h3 id="e6">Japanese Control of the Puppet Manchukuo Economy <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>The complete Japanese control of the puppet Manchukuo economy has been advocated for two or three years. The reasons for its lack of implementation can be attributed to two main factors. First, internal conflicts within Japan itself have not been resolved. For instance, the diplomatic, colonial, and military departments stand in a three-legged opposition, or in other words, there are many divisions between financial cliques, bureaucrats, and warlords, hindering smooth progress. Second, international restrictions and China's resistance pose considerable constraints, forcing Japan to exercise some caution. Currently, the disharmony among Japan's own financial cliques, bureaucrats, and warlords is gradually decreasing. The so-called unified rule of "two in one" has become a possibility. The political impasse is expected to be broken, and efforts are being made to ease international tensions, hence the move towards economic control.</p>
<p>Before Japan implemented control over the "Manchukuo" economy, there was a minor event: the collection of iron scraps and purchase of iron-making raw materials. This matter may seem insignificant on the surface, but upon closer examination, we realize it holds profound implications. Although Japan proclaims to its citizens that it is self-sufficient in steel and iron, with domestic production reaching nearly 2.3 million tons, the reality is that the majority of steel and iron raw materials rely on external supply from places like the Malay Peninsula. During normal times, this does not pose a major problem. However, in times of war, there is a risk of supply being cut off. During this critical period, Japan is vigorously expanding its military industry, and the demand for steel and iron is naturally very high. Does this collection of steel and iron raw materials not contain far-reaching significance? Looking at this one small aspect of Japan's control of the puppet Manchukuo economy, one can understand its future direction. In terms of the mainland, the most sharply opposed in terms of economic interests and closely bordering the three northeastern provinces is the Soviet Union. The ideological influence exerted by the Soviet Union on Japanese society has made Japan feel very uneasy, yet it cannot be completely eradicated. Moreover, historical animosity exists, so the Japanese army has to maintain strict vigilance against the Soviet Union. In its first Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union fully focused on the defense of the Far East, and now its military facilities are even more advanced. Its diplomatic skills are also very astute. After successfully joining the League of Nations, it has gained an advantageous position in the international arena. Despite loudly proclaiming its opposition to the Soviet Union, Japan is hesitant to take action. In this reluctance to act rashly, it has adopted this first step of controlling the puppet Manchukuo economy. The actual benefits gained from this control policy outweigh the losses, compared to advancing into Siberia.</p>
<p>This reminds us of the summer of the 20th year of the Republic (1931), when Japan appointed Yasuya Uchida, who was fluent in Russian, as president of the South Manchuria Railway, and named Isei Tatekawa, a former army officer and politician, as Governor-General of Korea, tasking them with planning the September 18th Incident, seizing the three northeastern provinces, and dealing with the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, we did not foresee this at the time, resulting in complete passivity and being manipulated by others. Now, Japan's so-called continental policy is still unforgettable. After the puppet Manchukuo's reorganization, its control over the "Manchukuo" economy, although containing anti-Soviet implications, is by no means limited to solely targeting the Soviet Union. This is what we must clearly understand today.</p>

<p>(Washington) Senator Nye, chairman of the Senate Arms Investigation Committee, announced today that the political activities of DuPont Corporation will only be released after the congressional elections. Releasing them now would embarrass many candidates, Nye said. The company has heavily funded several primary candidates in recent weeks, all on the condition that they support the company's legislative demands in the future. However, the company will no longer dare to provide funding, knowing that it will eventually be revealed. Meanwhile, the State Department has received several protests against the committee's release of secret contracts between various countries and arms merchants. It is reported that three countries have filed formal protests. Mexico recently filed a protest in the name of President Rodriguez, whose name was implicated. The UK also filed a formal protest involving the name of King George. Argentina protested against the committee's remarks that several high-ranking government officials were involved in arms sales in South America. However, Nye insisted that he would thoroughly investigate regardless of any obstacles. (Fifteenth National Telegraph)</p>

<p>(Washington) General Johnson, director of the US Recovery Administration, criticized the textile workers' union strike as a breach of faith and a violation of contract. Today, this has triggered a strong reaction. The strike committee of the Textile Workers Union also issued a declaration of war today, demanding the resignation of General Johnson, stating that he has clearly demonstrated a lack of sympathy for labor and fabricated facts. The so-called contract was signed last June, with the Recovery Administration, the Textile Industry Association, and the Textile Workers Union agreeing to submit all disputes to arbitration. Union Vice President Gorman said that General Johnson has repeatedly attacked labor groups, and called Mr. Johnson's speech last night despicable. "I do not want to call General Johnson a liar last night," said Gorman, "but what he said is certainly not true." Union President McMahon also stated that Mr. Johnson is protecting capital. The mediation committee sent by President Roosevelt is still continuing its efforts to resolve the situation. However, both sides have made no concessions, so no progress has been made. The situation in various places is said to be calm. Factories in Georgia will resume work on Monday, fearing riots. The commander of the Georgia National Guard, Lindran, has received instructions from Governor Talmadge to mobilize 4,000 National Guard troops at 6:00 a.m. on Monday to maintain order. (Fifteenth National Telegraph)</p>
<p>(New York) Today, because it is a weekend holiday, all cotton mills are closed, so the textile industry area is still peaceful. However, the commander of the Maine National Guard said that the situation in Maine is still uneasy. He believes that next week will be the most serious period. National Guard troops in North Carolina and Georgia were ordered to deploy last night because strikers caused disturbances. Power plants and waterworks in Rhode Island are now heavily guarded, as authorities have heard that 25 sticks of high explosives have been stolen. General Johnson, director of the National Recovery Administration, recently declared that the textile strike is a violation of the understanding reached between him and McMahon, president of the Textile Workers Union, before the signing of the textile industry code. The strike committee chairman Gorman has now replied to this point. Gorman said that General Johnson broke the agreement on June 2nd. Mr. Johnson's actions at the time showed that he was not qualified to be a good national official. William Green, vice president of the American Federation of Labor, said today that General Johnson's "unreasonable wording" has increased the difficulty of reaching a compromise.

<p>(Washington) The US Treasury Department today filed another lawsuit against former Treasury Secretary Mellon for evading taxes on all income in 1931, alleging that he evaded over $1 million in taxes. It has requested the Tax Appeals Board to conduct a thorough investigation. Upon hearing the news, Mellon said that the Treasury Department's actions were extremely astonishing, attempting to re-litigate the old case that the Supreme Court had already ruled on in May in civil court. The Treasury Department's move is nothing more than an attempt to save face. It is reported that Mellon once served as the ambassador to the UK. In May of this year, he was accused by the Treasury Department of underpaying $1,319,000 in income tax in 1931, and the Treasury Department also requested the court to impose a fine of $659,540. At the time, Mellon said that the Treasury Department's case was the most contemptible political maneuver. In fact, he had paid the estimated income tax by the government. In the past 20 years, he had paid over $20 million in income tax. (Sixteenth Reuters Telegraph)</p>

<p>Implemented from the 24th of this month. The authorities stated today that this regulation should not be interpreted as control. In order to protect foreign exporters from obtaining payment for their goods, the old system of allocating foreign currency to German importers will be changed. Therefore, importers will be notified in advance whether the Deutsche Bank is able to provide foreign currency to pay for imported goods. Therefore, the new system is actually a way to ensure that foreign exporters receive immediate payment for their goods. The authorities will now issue five orders regarding the transit of goods, the establishment of a raw materials control bureau, and changes to the laws on foreign currency control currently in force. From September 24th, Germany's import trade and industrial and agricultural commerce will be supervised by the 25 bureaus of the central government. (Fifteenth Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Germany's foreign trade totaled 677,000,000 marks in August, a decrease of 7,000,000 marks compared to 684,000,000 marks in July. However, overall, there has actually been progress. The import surplus in August was only 9,000,000 marks, compared to 42,000,000 marks in July. With the exception of the 3,000,000 mark export surplus in March, August was actually the most profitable month for trade this year. This is clearly the result of controlled foreign trade. Taking imports as an example, the 363,000,000 marks in July decreased to 343,000,000 marks in August. The same month last year was 347,000,000 marks. Imports have decreased by 6% since July this year, mainly due to a decrease of 18,000,000 marks in food imports. The most optimistic aspect is that exports increased from 321,000,000 marks in July to 324,000,000 marks in August. The same month last year was 413,000,000 marks. Therefore, exports increased by 13,000,000 marks, or 4%, from July to August this year. The increase in imports was partly due to raw materials such as coal, and partly due to finished products, with roughly equal proportions. Exports to France, Switzerland, and the Netherlands decreased, but exports to Sweden, Italy, the UK, and Soviet Russia increased significantly, largely offsetting the decreases.

<p>(National News Agency German Correspondence) Dr. Wengel of Germany made the following remarks on the modern German woman. The content of German women's lives is to be sought in the family, so that they can gain a good reputation, be a housekeeper, or a good wife and mother. We firmly believe that this German plan will eventually be realized. A good mother is the highest ideal of modern German women. The meaning is not superficial, but specifically for the care of future children, for the sake of future human happiness. We know that children need to live in a healthy and happy family every day. It is the undeniable duty of mothers to manage children, and children must have a good family. We firmly believe that when parents share joys and sorrows and help each other, children will love their parents. In order to manage the family, women's bodies and spirits will naturally become stronger, so the feelings between families and couples will increase day by day, and wives, husbands, and children will feel more cheerful. Unmarried women should also enrich their lives and find spiritual comfort in life. Therefore, national socialism pays special attention to women's morality. Based on this principle, it rescues women, heals women, manages women, and supports women, so that female virtues do not decline, arouse women's interests, and work hard. Only in this way can we save the declining customs and realize women's happiness. As of now, there are many women in Germany who have received higher education, such as countless male and female college graduates, but most of these college students cannot adapt to the conditions of national life. Girls account for 10% of them. In essence, although female college students in Germany study at school, they are actually just listening to German lectures in college. Today, to solve the German women's problem, we cannot borrow from foreign countries. We must carefully observe the characteristics of Germany and not ignore Germany's long-standing customs, religion, and the status of German women. But we must observe the situation of German women in the past decade in order to understand everything. Modern German women are truly extremely happy. Our leader pays special attention to women's issues, but women must also be loyal to our party. In recent months, the German government has dealt with many issues concerning women, such as uniting many virtuous couples, enabling young and handsome men and women to form good relationships and live in peace. Secondly, if women from the age of 17 to 25 have to manage housework for up to 52 weeks, they will be able to reduce their taxes. Today, we cannot relax. If there are some women who cannot work for the country, we can advise them: think about it, we now need to build the country, we must follow the government's plan and implement it step by step. Men are the foundation of national construction, so women must basically be family attendants or managers in order to get through this very difficult period. We need strong women, married women manage housework, children, and serve their parents-in-law, and unmarried women cannot infringe on the status of men. We know very well that Germany is still in a difficult period, which is naturally the suffering of both men and women, but we must have a firm will to overcome this difficulty. In this way, there will definitely be a way out in the future.</p>

<p>Calligraphy and Painting News</p>
<p>Xu Cifang's Calligraphy: Xu Cifang is the literary grandson of Xu Jihe, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Rites from Jiading, and the second son of Provincial Governor Xi Cheng of Jilin Province. He excels in poetry and prose and is skilled in regular script in the six styles of calligraphy, deeply inheriting the spirit of the Jin and Tang dynasties. His works are highly valued by renowned figures at home and abroad, but he is quite self-appreciative and does not always create for others. In recent years, he has been selling his calligraphy in Tianjin and Qingdao, and many friends have entrusted postal services to request his work from afar. Although Mr. Xu has reluctantly agreed, the round trips are delayed and costly. Now that Mr. Xu is residing in Shanghai for some matters, colleagues have requested that he make an exception for two months for those in this area who wish to request his calligraphy. He has agreed and has a discounted price list available. Please send letters requesting the list to Mr. Xu, No. 5 Mingde Lane, Huanlong Road, French Concession, this city.</p>

<p>Issue 27 Reading News</p>
<p>Compiled by the Reading Guidance Department of the Shenbao Circulation Library</p>
<p>Contents (1) Mailbox (2) Announcements</p>
<p>Mailbox (1) New Regulations for Individual Replies: Due to the daily increase in letters to this department, we previously answered letters from both those who had joined the "Reading Guidance" department and those who were only doing "Reading Q&amp;A" indiscriminately. However, we now have to differentiate. We have temporarily decided that those who have joined the guidance department will have the right to receive replies earlier. We will still answer letters from general "Reading Q&amp;A" readers as faithfully and as quickly as possible, without undue delay. As for the date of receiving replies, we will strictly implement the time that has already been announced in the previous issue (Issue 26).</p>
<p>(2) Reservation of Registration</p>
<p>This department has seen that many readers have registered with this department, but have not been seen discussing anything with us afterwards. Therefore, we feel that if they have no sincerity in reading, why bother with an empty name? Therefore, we have had to cancel the registration of some friends. Now, we have not received their letters stating whether they do not write because they are too busy with life to have time to read and write letters, or whether their boss deliberately interferes with their correspondence. Therefore, "I feel very ashamed, having not read, what is there to ask?" So I haven't been in touch for a long time, but they all requested that we still retain their registration. In their busy lives, they still want us to be able to "guide" them and have the opportunity to have a "life consultant." We are naturally willing to accept this request, but we hope that all readers in this situation will still use a few minutes of their spare time to write us a few words each month to notify us. We not only welcome such diligent readers to communicate, but also welcome such friends to talk (however, please make an appointment in advance).</p>
<p>(3) No Reply for Unclear Addresses</p>
<p>We will not reply to any submissions that do not include a mailing address. In the future, we will only publish names in this publication for those who cannot send mail this week: Shen Jing, Liu Fang, He Menghu. Announcements</p>
<p>Today's Reading Q&amp;A is suspended for one day. Tomorrow's Reading Q&amp;A will continue to publish "Attitude Towards Work." Please pay special attention to this reply.</p>

<p>Little West Heaven</p>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 2 Sold into the Homes of Ordinary People, Returning to Yongshou, Leaving Home, Heavenly People Arrive in Chang'an</p>
<p>Zhang Jiefu first felt that his words were somewhat inappropriate, so he said: "What I mean is, seeing the people suffering so much here, what are your thoughts?" Li Shilian said: "As the saying goes, 'The people's feelings are like iron, the law of the officials is like a furnace; there is no soybean in the world that cannot be squeezed for oil.' I didn't quite believe these words before, but now I understand." The section chief, hearing him talk on and on, always about the affairs inside the tax collection agency, laughed and said: "Mr. Li has always been in charge of taxation, right? It can truly be said that three sentences cannot leave the profession." Only then did Li Shilian realize that he had been careless in his speech and had been seen through. His face flushed for a moment, and he forced a smile, not daring to say anything more. With this little anecdote, it was inconvenient to discuss this dilapidated manor any further. The driver had finished adding water and repaired the car. Everyone got in and continued driving forward. For those who had never been here before, everyone couldn't help but think that King Wen of Zhou built the road more than 2,000 years ago. Logically, the trees here should be denser than those of the Han and Tang dynasties. Furthermore, such a great emperor's tomb must also be in a place with beautiful mountains and rivers. Everyone eagerly looked out of the car, wanting to be the first to see the ancient relics. Unexpectedly, the car drove onto a plateau, and under the broad daylight, all that could be seen was a vast expanse of yellow earth, gradually rising until it met the sky in the distance. In the middle of this, there were some mounds as high as houses, either standing alone or clustered together in groups of three or five, obviously man-made, but no one could guess what they were for. Zhang Jiefu said: "Are these tombs? Why are they so big?" Li Shilian had already misspoke himself and did not dare to answer, fearing that he would make another joke. The other two people in the car seemed to have formed their own group. They only looked at Zhang and Li, as if with a smile on their faces (20).</p>
<h3 id="e26">Supplement of Old Newspapers <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>— By Liu Cunren</p>
<p>I have a very special hobby in my life, which is to collect newspapers from various places. Now, gathered together, I already have more than a hundred kinds. Sometimes there are many valuable historical materials inside that cannot be found elsewhere.</p>
<p>I have a Shimin Daily from the Guangxu period of the late Qing Dynasty. The content is extremely simple. There is a lack of political and social news, only government reports, announcements, imperial records, etc.; but the supplement is very rich: there are new jokes, and the Guangya New Bishi novel written by Shi Nanchu. Reading it now, I really feel a different flavor. Let me cite an extraordinary omen as follows: "In the Xinhai year of the first year of Xianfeng (1851), the Chu Bei provincial examination had the topic of 'When the world is righteous, ordinary people do not criticize.' A certain top scholar, when explaining the last sentence, said: 'It feels like a scene of peace is right before our eyes.' At that time, Hunan was warning of danger. A year later, Chu Bei fell, and the words 'Taiping Heavenly Kingdom' were everywhere on notices, door plaques, and flags. This student deliberately made a good omen to please the times, but unexpectedly it became a prophecy." Isn't this good material for a Red Sheep Heroic Biography?</p>
<p>Speaking of newspapers in the interior, none of the dozens of kinds that I have retained are perfect. The layout of the Henan Evening News is very good, the structure of the Beijing Evening News is very new, and the editorials of the Jiangxi Raozhou Minbao are very proper. These are their special strengths. The most complete newspaper promoting vernacular Chinese is the Beiping Vernacular Real Report, which uses all new-style punctuation.</p>
<p>The content of Guangzhou newspapers need not be mentioned for now, but the supplements can be considered extremely bad: they are all diary-style shoddy things. Comparatively speaking, the Republican Daily is more well-known. But it's still not as good as newspapers from other places.</p>
<p>As for Tianjin, Beiping, Jinan, Nanjing...etc., I cannot talk about them all at once. I didn't expect that collecting small newspaper supplements would fill a large belly of history!</p>

<p>Money is monopolized by the rich. The monkey looking in the mirror doesn't know that what it sees is itself.</p>
<p>If you want to borrow money from someone, you are selling yourself.</p>
<p>A person without money falling in love is like a deaf person listening to music.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Red Paper Packet <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>— Spring Rain Building Master</p>
<p>The wonderful use of red paper packets is very broad, and they contain a mysterious meaning. For example, when asking a Chinese medicine doctor to diagnose an illness, after opening the prescription, you have to take out a red paper packet from your side, which is considered the consultation fee, the amount ranging from several dimes to several yuan. However, the polite doctors need to decline with you for a while, and never count the amount inside the packet in person. This shows the profound mystery of the red paper packet.</p>
<p>There is another thing that makes me confused. Since I was a child, I suffered from malaria every day. The onset was very fierce. After a few days, my face was yellow and thin, and I had no appetite. My parents were very worried, but they didn't know about swallowing quinine. They specialized in getting some small secret prescriptions, or asked someone to draw a talisman on a cake to eat in the morning facing the sun. Or they asked someone to send the malaria ghost out of the house, but none of them worked. One day, my mother used a small square of red paper and wrapped seven grains of raw rice, seven tea leaves, and a Shunzhi copper coin inside. She placed it by my side. My mother accompanied me out for a walk. When we reached the crossroads, she secretly threw away the red paper packet, without looking back. I did the same, and sure enough, the malaria did not come that day.</p>
<p>A certain woman in Huzhou engaged in prostitution, but she also had to consider her husband's face, so she came up with a method of using a red paper packet. The method was to put a red paper packet at the door, implying that there was someone inside, and the husband would not enter. If there was no red paper packet at the door, it meant that there were no guests inside. This was indeed a very clever hint.</p>

<h3 id="e30">The Cow Butcher <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Shouruo</p>
<p>Because of the restoration of the old ritual of worshipping Confucius, I was reminded of the cow butcher.</p>
<p>In the former Qing Dynasty, Confucius was worshipped twice a year, in spring and autumn. The most important sacrificial offering was the cow, called the "tailao" (great offering). The government paid the money, the rites department handled it, and the cow butcher procured it. And there were many interesting malpractices in between!</p>
<p>For example, if the government allocated 30 yuan to the rites department for the price of the cow, then the more kindhearted rites department would at least skim off 10 yuan, and the more ruthless ones would naturally take half, or even more, and then pass it on to the cow butcher for procurement.</p>
<p>The position of cow butcher was bestowed by the official government. Of course, he had to be on duty for procuring the tailao for worshipping Confucius, but it wasn't a business if he had to pay for it himself. The axe eats the chisel, and the chisel eats the wood, so of course he had a place to eat from as well.</p>
<p>The cow heads (that is, the brokers who buy and sell cattle) in each village had a customary practice of buying the cow butcher's account. Therefore, the cow butcher not only charged them illegal fees every year, but also ordered them to supply the tailao. If they didn't buy his account, then! Then! Sorry, just issue a ticket on some pretext, and the guest ticket would come. Therefore, the cow heads had to buy his account, which was an unspeakable grievance!</p>
<p>At the same time, the cow butcher was necessarily the executioner. He handled both killing cows and killing people, and he can be said to be the number one slaughter machine for both humans and animals. So his attitude, which I still dread, was very imposing, fierce, and terrifying!</p>

<h3 id="e31">御香縹緲錄 <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Princess Der Ling, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>He pretended to be extremely loyal, saying that he was acting on a secret edict from Emperor Guangxu to assassinate the Empress Dowager, but upon reflection, he couldn't bear to do it. Therefore, he defied Guangxu's orders and came to inform on him. Although his words were so empty and without any real evidence, the Empress Dowager completely trusted him. So that very night, he led the troops he had brought and escorted the Empress Dowager, using a lightning-fast method, straight into Guangxu's bedroom. The Empress Dowager was in a great rage at this time and, disregarding all decorum, ordered people to drag Guangxu out of bed. Without even asking a question, she immediately forced him to sign an edict ceding power back to her. The result of this life-or-death struggle was that the Empress Dowager regained control and resumed her former power, while Guangxu was greatly unlucky! From then on, the Empress Dowager vowed never to forgive him, ignoring everything he said. Of course, Guangxu was sure to bear a bitter grudge against Yuan Shikai for this betrayal and deeply resent it, but unfortunately, he never got to avenge himself! When he followed the Empress Dowager on this yellow train to Tianjin, he had already spent six or seven years of the political prisoner's life Yuan Shikai had bestowed upon him. In fact, he never regained his freedom until his death.</p>
<p>Now, let's see! This prisoner-like Emperor Guangxu is approaching his enemy! Although he is riding in another carriage, so many officials have come to greet them at the station. How could he hide and not come out? He must stand respectfully behind the Empress Dowager, accepting the greetings of these people. I remember that whenever the Empress Dowager was not around, when Guangxu and I were casually talking, I often heard him talk about his feelings about the Hundred Days' Reform. Every time, he would gnash his teeth and curse Yuan Shikai, who fabricated lies and framed him. So I had long held an extremely excited heart, planning to see his expression after meeting Yuan Shikai face to face. (129)</p>

<p>Sports News</p>
<p>American Baseball Team Scheduled to Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>A Team of Sixteen Arrives on December 4th</p>
<p>Baseball King Babe Ruth is Also Among Them</p>
<p>All of Them are World-Class American Players</p>
<p>The American baseball team, a group of sixteen, including baseball king Babe Ruth, are all world-class American professional baseball players. They will participate in this year's World Series and will form a team to travel to East Asia in October. They are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on December 4th. The local Western baseball teams have all heard the news and are very excited. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Tour Itinerary The team is scheduled to depart from Vancouver on the Changxing Steamer on October 22nd. They will have three games in Honolulu and then go to Japan. They will stay in Japan for a month and will have as many as sixteen exhibition games. Then, on December 2nd, they will leave Kobe for Shanghai and are scheduled to arrive on the 4th. They will leave Shanghai for Manila on the 5th and have six or seven games in the Philippines. Therefore, they will only stay in Shanghai for one day.</p>
<p>Performance in Shanghai The Shanghai Amateur Baseball Association, upon hearing the news, immediately telegraphed Mr. Heibe, the manager of the team in Philadelphia, asking the team to give an exhibition game when they arrive in Shanghai, competing against a mixed team of the Shanghai Mais and Japanese teams. However, they have not yet received a reply from Philadelphia. December 4th is when the weather in Shanghai is severely cold. Whether the team is willing to perform in the cold is still a question. The reason why the team cannot come to the East earlier is that they must wait until after the World Series finals before they can leave the United States.</p>

<p>Educational Tidbits</p>
<p>Director of the Jiangsu Education Department Zhou Fohai</p>
<p>Letter to Secondary School Principals</p>
<p>Discussing Training, Teaching and Administrative Issues</p>
<p>Zhou Fohai, Director of the Jiangsu Education Department, sent a letter to the principals of secondary schools yesterday, saying:</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province's education has always enjoyed a high reputation. Since I was ordered to oversee education in this province, I have deeply feared that the reality will not live up to the name, thus failing the public's expectations. Therefore, I have been diligently working day and night, daring not to be idle. Fortunately, with the efforts of my colleagues, secondary education in the province has been put on the right track, and the studies of young people have been spared from neglect. Looking back on myself, I am somewhat comforted. However, educational undertakings either advance or retreat. Although the progress of secondary education in Jiangsu Province can be said to be step by step, and past achievements can be seen, if we take the entire education as a comprehensive calculation, then the joint efforts of Fohai and my colleagues over the years are still just patching up the gaps. Although there is also the reality of reforming the old and establishing the new, the work of patching up has not been completed for a day, and the foundation of innovation has not been established for a day. Therefore, looking forward to the future, I am both happy and afraid. I am happy that the vitality of the principals and colleagues can last for a long time without being discouraged, and I am afraid that my personal thoughts may be occasionally sparse and incomplete. Therefore, at the beginning of the semester, I want to have a written chat with the principals and colleagues, wanting to use my incomplete thoughts as a small help to learn from others' strengths, and especially hoping that my colleagues, based on their undiminished vitality, will make the determination to move forward bravely.</p>
<p>Regarding training and teaching, there are several points that I want to express my expectations for, such as the issue of physical education, how to make all teachers and students of the school cheer up together and fundamentally break the habit of being weak, how to make the teaching and training integration system increase the efficiency of implementation and not have the feeling that what is seen is not as good as what is heard, how to make all teachers and students of the school automatically implement the New Life Covenant and not generate the drawbacks of forced whitewashing. For these basic and important issues belonging to the training and teaching aspects, the department will not consider the difficulty of exhausting efforts to plan and launch internally, and especially hopes that the principals and colleagues can also not avoid hard work and complaints to exhaust efforts to implement and promote externally, so that the advocacy of laws and regulations can become the school's atmosphere. In this way, the spirit of the training and teaching aspects of secondary education in the province will rise without being invigorated.</p>
<p>Regarding administration, there are also several matters that are hoped to be implemented diligently, such as how to execute laws and regulations with special speed to make administrative efficiency increase exceptionally, how to audit in advance when going out on official business to save time, how to pay attention to full-time employment and reduce part-time positions when hiring teachers without losing the reality of choosing people for the job, how to not slightly exist the habit of being lenient or perfunctory due to the friendship of colleagues and the habits of senior students when handling training and teaching matters, how to try to avoid dealing with the external environment to make the spirit of running the school be single-minded and not divided, how to carry forward the inherent spirit of seeking truth from facts in various schools so that the publication of any publication not only has no smell of propaganda text but also has the spirit of cherishing people's strengths. All of these are just what Fohai has thought of personally, thinking that they are more important in the school's administration. It is not necessarily that the principals and colleagues do not pay attention to them on weekdays, but it is hoped that all colleagues will pay special attention to them in the future. For the key to governance is not in saying more, but in acting vigorously. If the work is not vigorously implemented in various schools, then any plans of the Education Department are just empty words.</p>
<p>In short, Fohai has been with the principals and colleagues for a long time. We treat each other with sincerity and understand each other with impartiality. There is nothing that cannot be said, and everything can be said. The suggestions made by the principals and colleagues on weekdays have made Fohai deeply benefit from collecting opinions, and the temporary speeches of Fohai may also be a resource for the colleagues to learn from. We hope to work together to use the spirit of reforming the old and establishing the new to do the work of making up for the deficiencies. The day when the work of making up for the deficiencies is completed is the time when the foundation of innovation is established. I would like to encourage all my colleagues. Words cannot express everything. I hope you will understand.</p>
<p>Chinese Educational Film Association Standing Committee Meeting</p>
<p>Discussing the Formation of the Beijing Municipal Educational Film Promotion Committee</p>

<p>Students Go to Study in Japan</p>
<p>▲Japanese Books Sell Well Again</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun reported that recently, due to the drastic changes in Sino-Japanese exchange rates, 100 Chinese silver dollars can be exchanged for 120 Japanese gold dollars. Therefore, the number of Chinese students going to study in Japan has also suddenly increased. This month, male students leaving Shanghai, for each departing mail steamer, there must be twenty or thirty. It is estimated that there were fifty on the Nagasaki Maru departing on the 6th, more than ninety on the Shanghai Maru on the 11th, thirty or forty on the Nagasaki Maru on the 13th, and forty or fifty on the 16th. They are mostly going to Tokyo to study. Also, according to people in Japanese bookstores in this port, recently Chinese students are very enthusiastic about studying the Japanese language, and the sales of Japanese books are in a situation where supply cannot meet demand.</p>

<p>Second Children's Library</p>
<p>Mobile Bookmobile Begins to Patrol</p>
<p>▲Departing at 9 am and Returning to the Library at 6 pm Every Day</p>
<p>▲Currently Only One Vehicle is Prepared, but Four More Will be Added Starting Next Month</p>
<p>The second children's library, jointly organized by the Children's Happiness Committee and the Children's Morning Post, began patrolling with its mobile bookmobile yesterday. Hu Shuyi, standing committee member of children's happiness, made a special trip to the library on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, braving the wind and rain, to inspect and give instructions on everything. The patrols are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Eliminate Bookstalls and Facilitate Apprentices The significance of the library holding mobile bookmobiles is to facilitate children's reading along the way, using active methods to eliminate the small bookstalls on the road that specialize in bad books invisibly, while delivering books to shops for apprentices to borrow, and returning to collect them regularly, saving the apprentices from the trouble of running around to borrow and return them, which is also a concrete manifestation of bringing education to their doorsteps.</p>
<p>Bookmobile Style is Exquisite and Beautiful The mobile bookmobile is designed and manufactured by the library. It has two wheels, a handle for easy pushing, books inserted on both sides, books and ten canvas stools stored in the car, and the words "Second Children's Library Mobile Bookmobile No. 1" on the roof. The colors are bright, and there are advertisements around. It is heard that the purchase of this bookmobile and the employment of laborers are all funded by the advertising fees posted on the car. Currently, there are the Old North Gate Yonghe Industrial Company and the Friendship English Commercial Night School on Minguo Road.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Borrowing on the First Day of Patrol Yesterday, for the first patrol, Director Qian accompanied the departure to personally guide the children's borrowing procedures. In the morning, the patrol departed from the library to the north, directly to the Old North Gate, stopping eight times along the way, with 72 people surrounding and borrowing. In the afternoon, the patrol departed from the library to Zhonghua Road and the alleys of Penglai Road, stopping thirteen times, with 94 people surrounding and borrowing. Because the style of the car is beautiful, pedestrians gathered to watch everywhere. One day of patrol has attracted the attention of all citizens in Nanshi. Hereafter, patrols will be conducted daily, with the library determining the route, starting at 9 am and ending at 11:30 am, and starting at 1 pm and ending at 6 pm.</p>
<p>Four More Vehicles Will Be Added Starting Next Month The library, recognizing the great efficiency of this bookmobile, has ordered four more</p>
<h3 id="e32">Autumn Seasonal Foods <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Yun</p>
<p>Although the weather is still arid, several showers have brought a touch of coolness to the mornings and evenings. The autumn wind rustles, the earth is already veiled in misty mountains, and the sounds of insects fill the ears. After enduring the scorching summer, people's appetites naturally improve in this cool weather. Moreover, it is the season for spring flowers and autumn fruits; the perch is plump, the crabs are full of roe, the water caltrop is delicious, and the fox nuts are fresh. Various fruits are also in season. Strolling through the markets, the colors of orange, yellow, pear white, red, and purple dazzle the eyes, and one cannot help but be tempted. Therefore, I have selected and recorded some of the seasonal foods of autumn to create a small cookbook.</p>
<p>(1) Dishes</p>
<p>Spring Chicken These days, chickens are not yet large and robust, but their feathers are full, and they have lost their chick-like appearance. This type of chicken is like a young person, full of vitality. The chicken meat is tender and melts in the mouth. When braised until tender, even the bones are tender enough to chew. The flavor is especially rich and delicious, and it is also highly nutritious. Whether boiled or braised, it is endlessly flavorful. If simmered into chicken broth, it is also an excellent tonic!</p>
<p>Crab Crabs are a seasonal delicacy in autumn, as famous in Jiangnan as the perch of Songjiang. They scuttle sideways on the banks of lakes where reeds and knotweed grow. The Yangcheng Lake in Suzhou is famous for its crabs. These crabs have golden yellow hairs on their claws and strong claws that can stand and move sideways on a lacquered table, hence the name "Golden Claw Yangcheng". Unfortunately, this year's drought has caused significant drying of Yangcheng Lake, which will inevitably affect crab production. In addition to steaming and enjoying them with ginger and vinegar, crabs can also be cooked with flour or stir-fried with crab meat (crab roe), both of which are excellent autumn dishes. In addition to stir-frying, crab roe can also be used as a filling for various dim sum with pork and shrimp, with a fresh and delicious taste.</p>
<p>(2) Fruits</p>
<p>Apples These days, apples and pears are the most affordable fruits and are very common. Their bright red color resembles the rouge on a girl's face, making them very attractive. Apples can not only aid digestion but also prevent illness. A Western proverb says, "An apple a day keeps the doctor away." Ancient Chinese prescriptions say that apples can treat dysentery, and modern Western medicine has also proven that apple powder is highly effective in treating dysentery, demonstrating that apples have disease-curing effects in addition to aiding digestion.</p>
<p>Grapes Grapes contain a large amount of iron and have the effect of strengthening the stomach and body. Their shape resembles purple crystal balls, clear and lovely. Wine is undoubtedly an excellent drink, and grape juice is also fresh and sweet. Unfortunately, our country pays too little attention to the cultivation of grapes, so that the bunches of grapes in fruit shops are almost entirely imported. In this year of sharply increasing imports, it is truly alarming to see the state of our domestic products.</p>
<p>Water Caltrop The water caltrop from Suzhou is very famous, with many varieties successively appearing on the market. From early autumn to late autumn, water caltrop is continuously available. There are five types of water caltrop in Suzhou: small ones include acute-angled water caltrop and round-angled water caltrop, and large ones include small white water caltrop, monk's water caltrop, and wonton water caltrop. They can be eaten raw or cooked. Wonton water caltrop is especially fragrant and glutinous, making it the best of all water caltrop varieties.</p>
<p>Fox Nut Fox nut is a famous local product of Suzhou. When it is in the water, it is wrapped in its skin and looks like a chicken head, hence its common name "chicken head". The flesh of the chicken head is white and crystalline. The romantic Tang Emperor, Tang Xuanzong, stroked Consort Yang's nipples and called them "freshly peeled chicken head meat", which shows how lovely the shape of fox nut is. Fox nut soup is fragrant and delicious. Ground into a paste and cooked, it is also sweet and fragrant, making it a unique nourishing food for the elderly.</p>
<p>Chestnuts and Ginkgo Chestnuts have just come on the market these days. Stalls selling sugar-roasted chestnuts can be found everywhere in the market. These chestnuts are fragrant, glutinous, and sweet. Chewing on them in one's leisure time is indeed more substantial than eating melon seeds. In addition to roasting, chestnuts can also be cooked with chicken, which is very flavorful. Although ginkgo has a slightly bitter taste when stir-fried, it is also very delicious when cooked in porridge or stir-fried in dishes.</p>
<p>(3) Pastries</p>
<p>Mooncake It is the seasonal pastry of autumn. Although Suzhou mooncakes are not as huge and expensive as those from Guangdong, they also come in both vegetarian and meat fillings, with sweet and savory flavors, and the fillings number no less than twenty. Among the sweet ones, those with jujube paste, bean paste, rose, and mint are the best. The savory ones are best with fresh meat. When they are baked and come out of the oven, their deliciousness is truly beyond words!</p>
<h3 id="e33">Creation and Time <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Huaibai</p>
<p>The completion of a great work requires a considerable amount of time. This is an undeniable fact in history. To cite a few examples:</p>
<p>Zuo Si's "Rhapsody on the Three Capitals" was so widely recited that paper in Luoyang became expensive because he spent ten years writing it. Goethe's poetic drama "Faust" was so revolutionary in the world of literature and is still popular today because he spent fifty years, from the age of twenty-three to eighty-three, completing this masterpiece. Milton's position in English literature is second only to Shakespeare. However, his greatest epic poem, "Paradise Lost," also took twenty-seven years to write. Others, such as Thomson's "The Castle of Indolence" and Hardy's "The Dynasts," took more than ten years to complete. Even the short-lived genius poet Byron, who lived only thirty-six years, spent five years writing his satirical poem called "Don Juan." These are all very obvious facts. From these facts, we can imagine how diligent and careful a great writer is when writing his creation. Then, the honor and price obtained by publishing such works can naturally compensate for the energy and time he has sacrificed. Therefore, the creations that are called great writers are all obtained through long-term effort and hard work. They have their own way to achieve success, and their honors and positions are not obtained by luck or accident. Understanding this, we can confidently say that the quality of creation is directly proportional to time.</p>
<p>Of course, it is not difficult to find a few writers with quick wit and talent in history, such as Cao Zhi and Yuan Hu, one of whom could write poetry in seven steps, and the other could write while leaning on a horse. However, these are special geniuses, one in a hundred years. Educational psychologists tell us that geniuses and the mentally deficient account for a very small number. What nature gives us is mostly mediocre talent. To think of emulating these few special geniuses with mediocre talent is not only counterproductive but also impossible.</p>
<p>However, what is the situation in our current literary world? In terms of quantity, the so-called creations are produced in batches, which is quite impressive. But in terms of quality, except for a very few works that are worth appreciating, most of them are not decent. The writers' desire and courage to create are truly enviable, but their attitude towards creation is too casual. The only reason for this is that they have neglected the time required for creation. In this way, the rate of creation has increased, but the content of creation has undoubtedly been counterproductive. As a result, most of the works circulating in the publishing industry are shoddy. This cannot be solely attributed to the writers themselves. The urging of booksellers and the blind encouragement of critics must also bear considerable responsibility.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that writers will not cherish time too much. The garden of literature cannot be built in one fell swoop. It takes a lot of time to cultivate. Prolific writers are not what we need now. Great writers are what we really need. Because ten pounds of iron cannot be worth the price of one pound of gold, this is an honest saying.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Beginning and End <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Muzhai</p>
<p>As long as one is not forgetful, one should still remember the resounding slogan of the past: "Catch up from the front!" This was based on one's own backwardness. Let's not worry about whether we caught up or not, but at least we faced the front for a while.</p>
<p>Someone doubted this slogan, saying, "Catching up is to catch up from behind the tail. How can you catch up from the front? Since you are catching up from behind the tail, whether you walk slowly or speed up, you have to catch up step by step. You can't jump."</p>
<p>Listening to this, it seems reasonable, as if the slogan is incomprehensible, but in reality, it is "dissecting the meaning out of context." When you catch up, others are not standing still; they may even be moving faster. If you are behind the tail, assuming the speed is the same, then the tail of others is always your head. Wherever your head is, it is always the tail of others. Catch, catch, catch. How can you catch up? The meaning of "catch up from the front" is nothing more than learning from the progressive things of others, not learning from the dregs that others have abandoned, that is, to catch up from the front, not to chase after the tail. Of course, when catching up from the front, it would be best if you could take a look at the tail. The feces of others may be used as our fertilizer. But fertilizer is just fertilizer. Don't take it as a real meal.</p>
<p>But catching up behind the tail of others is still better than not catching up at all. Because the tail of others is always more advanced than us. It's always better than catching your own tail behind your own tail. Catching your own tail behind your own tail is like a standing dog, not knowing if it's itchy or for some other reason, turning around to bite its own tail, but can't bite it, just spinning around there, only amusing people.</p>
<p>The ancestors of mankind originally had tails. We have a "national curse," and it is an "ancient and strange curse," called "beasts in clothing." Although it is cursing people, although it comes from the mouths of those who do not understand science, it secretly coincides with anthropology. Only because the beasts were clothed did they lose a tail. "Customs" records two idioms: "The fox wants to cross the river, but what about the tail?" This says that the fox is bewildered by the inability to control its tail before crossing the river. The "Book of Changes" says, "The fox's tail is wet with fire." This says that the fox's tail is broken and rotten during the river crossing, and it must be very frustrated. It can be seen how the fox suffered from the loss of its tail, and mankind should be grateful for its fortune.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Should the Twenty-Four Histories Be Sold as a Complete Set? <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>— Pei Wei</p>
<p>In Mr. Lingmo's article "Starting from the Twenty-Four Histories" published in Free Talk a few days ago, he mentioned Kaiming's Twenty-Five Histories; and proposed revising the Twenty-Four Histories and publishing them in categories.</p>
<p>I generally agree with Mr. Lingmo's opinion: but I think there is room for discussion regarding his statement that "the Twenty-Four Histories should not be sold as a complete set at all."</p>
<p>Why shouldn't the Twenty-Four Histories be sold as a complete set at all? Mr. Lingmo offers two reasons: (1) Those who specialize in studying various aspects of a certain dynasty only need the history books of that dynasty and the two dynasties before and after it, so selling the Twenty-Four Histories as a complete set is extremely uneconomical for readers. (2) Those who specialize in studying a certain aspect of each dynasty need a certain part of each history, so for the convenience of readers, the Twenty-Four Histories should be published in categories, and should not be sold as a complete set. Regarding the first point, I think that Mr. Lingmo overemphasizes the change of dynasties of one surname and one family. In fact, history is continuous. The change of dynasties is only the transfer of political power. All systems and cultures have their relationship of inheriting the past and paving the way for the future. Therefore, to study the system and culture of a certain dynasty, one must first have a bird's-eye view of the history of the past five thousand years. Just as if we want to study the land equalization system of the Later Wei Dynasty, we must trace it back to the ancient well-field system, and even more, we must clarify the situation of powerful families annexing land since the Qin and Han Dynasties. At the same time, we must also study how the land equalization system affected later generations. In this way, what he needs is not only "the history books of a certain dynasty and the two dynasties before and after it." Regarding the second point, I also agree with Mr. Lingmo's proposal to publish in categories; but I think that publishing in categories and selling as a complete set can proceed in parallel. After all, the Twenty-Four Histories are different from ordinary encyclopedias. To study a certain aspect of each dynasty, what we need is not only a certain part of each history. For example, the treatises on astronomy and the five elements in the Twenty-Four Histories, although they are a part that "ordinary readers cannot read or do not need to read," but if we want to study the religious thought of feudal society, the treatises on astronomy and the five elements are excellent reference materials. Not only that, if we want to study the economic policies and land systems of past dynasties, the treatises on food and goods in each history are naturally excellent materials, but some historical materials have to be found outside of the treatises on food and goods. Just as the Treatise on Food and Goods in the Book of Han says, "Duke Xiao of Qin used Shang Yang, destroyed the merged fields, opened up fields, and emphasized the rewards of farming and warfare, ... so he overthrew neighboring countries and became a hegemon among the feudal lords." What was the effect of Shang Yang's changing the field system at that time, whether productivity was improved, and why destroying the well-field system and opening up fields would overthrow neighboring countries and make him a hegemon among the feudal lords, the Treatise on Food and Goods in the Book of Han does not clearly tell us; so we have to turn to the Biography of Shang Yang in the Records of the Grand Historian, which tells us that after Shang Yang changed the field system, "every household was rich and people were content," and also said that "after ten years of implementation, the villages and towns were greatly governed." We can also find evidence from other biographies, such as the Biography of Li Si in the Records of the Grand Historian, which has the words "Duke Xiao used Shang Yang's laws to change customs, the people became prosperous, and the country became rich and strong." The era of Li Si was not far from Shang Yang, and it can be used as strong corroborating evidence. Therefore, although publishing the Twenty-Four Histories in categories has its conveniences: but if readers only look for a certain type of material from a certain category, they will inevitably miss many important historical materials.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Lingmo also proposed that the imperial chronicles and biographies of each history should be arranged according to surnames, and a comprehensive dictionary of personal names should be compiled. The foreign biographies, biographies of the four barbarians, biographies of the Xiongnu, and biographies of the Western Regions in each history should be compiled into a special volume. I think that instead of rearranging the imperial chronicles and biographies of each history according to the number of strokes, it would be more meaningful to make a complete "Index of Personal Names in the Twenty-Four Histories" (the existing "Historical Surname Rhyme Compilation" only lists the names of those who have biographies in history, or those who are relatively famous even without biographies, which is less than one-tenth of the entire history, and there is a need to recompile it, but this work is too large, and it will take ten or five years). As for compiling the Biography of the Xiongnu and the Biography of the Western Regions into a special volume, it may not be an economical method; but if we only read the Biography of the Western Regions of the two Han Dynasties without reading the Biography of Zhang Qian and the Biography of Ban Chao, we still do not have enough understanding of the communication between the Han Dynasty and the Western Regions.</p>
<p>In short, I do not oppose Mr. Lingmo's proposal of categorizing and revising, but I think that the Twenty-Four Histories are fundamentally different from ordinary encyclopedias. The imperial chronicles, tables, treatises, and biographies all have their intricate and interconnected relationships. Although "categorized publishing does not harm the essence of the original book," the complete set of the Twenty-Four Histories has its own value and needs, and it is definitely not "should not be sold as a complete set at all."</p>

<h3 id="e37">Memories of Langzhong (Part 2) <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>— Chuan Ren</p>
<p>We have to take an hour here to do the elegant deeds of literati and poets, quietly appreciating Lang Mountain and Lang River, and looking at the fairy buildings of Langyuan. But thinking carefully, the hairs on my body stand on end! In this day and age, we are still learning to dream like idiots and linger on the scenery. I'm afraid that even Lu Dongbin, who writes poetry with cantaloupe juice, is a bit unaccustomed!</p>
<p>According to the stone tablet on Jinping Mountain with Lu Zu's cantaloupe skin poem, it says that Lu Xian visited Junping here, using cantaloupe skin as a pen and cantaloupe juice as ink, and recited poetry on the stone. Later, good people carved the words according to the original trace. The poem says: "When the sea is calm and the river is clear, I ride a deer down from the emerald platform. Just because Junping goes to the bottom of the river, it doesn't hurt to come to Jinping!"</p>
<p>This shows that Lu Zu wants to write poetry and visit friends when the sea is calm and the river is clear. How dare we come here presumptuously on a day when the sea is not calm and the river is not clear? Therefore, poetry grace is not at home this day, and not a single sentence is written, and the reason is not for anything else.</p>
<p>Inside the city, there are refugee camps everywhere. All the ancestral halls and temples are filled with refugees from Tongjiang, Najiang, Bazhong, and other counties. On the one hand, the government provides two meals of porridge a day, and on the other hand, private families cook some black rice themselves. Life is maintained like this. Fortunately, there is no need to work, and the days can be spent for the time being. As for the filth and stench in the camp and the spread of disease, the officials and the people do not care. The local Langzhong people, although their eyes are red with envy at the refugees eating white rice, are helpless, because they supply the government, and the government supplies the refugees. It is originally a heaven and earth of impartiality, benevolence, and righteousness. Can other things still be taken care of?</p>
<p>One morning, I was drinking tea in a small teahouse and talking about the commercial depression. An old man with a dry tobacco pipe walked up to me, dipped his finger in the teacup, and drew the characters "Luo", "Zheng", and "Fa" on the table. His intention was to say that the Luo surname was conquering too much. Although I understood the general idea, I still wanted to ask further, but he stuck out his tongue, turned around, and left!</p>
<p>While I was calming my mind, suddenly someone with a pistol walked by on the street, followed by a red-faced, western-dressed, leather-shoed military officer striding forward. Unexpectedly, an old woman sprang out from the side, knelt forward on both knees, and shouted, "Commander, save me!" The officer glanced at her and immediately called to the guards behind him, "Arrest her!" In this way, he still walked away unconsciously.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Mr. Village Chief (Part 3) <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Renshu</p>
<p>"What's wrong! Are you crazy?" followed by the weeping voice of Sister-in-law Wen.</p>
<p>"I'm not crazy, but you are crazy, how can you not even see your husband, and not even tea?"</p>
<p>"Oh! Are you angry with me for this?" This time, Sister-in-law Wen sat down on the bamboo chair. "That's good, that's good, as long as you can provide us with three meals a day, and I don't have to go east and west to beg for favors, I will wait on you with tea all day long! You are a man after all, how can you not even fill the rice bowls of your wife and children, —— you headless corpse! You shameless floater! What kind of bird village chief are you anyway!..."</p>
<p>At this point, Sister-in-law Wen was crying, scolding, and recounting. When she was heartbroken, tears fell like a tide.</p>
<p>"Damn it —— damn it ——"</p>
<p>Under the attack of Sister-in-law Wen, who turned defense into offense, Mr. Feng Wen had to change his tactics and turn attack into defense. He also lowered his voice and used this set of national curses to extricate himself. However, Sister-in-law Wen did not let him go.</p>
<p>"You also have a face. You post notices all day long, run to the district office, climb mountain tops, and you only have enough food for yourself, and you still want the old woman to find a way. Good, if you can kick, then let the old woman go out and see if the old woman can't feed this pus bag that my parents gave me. You headless corpse! You! You!..."</p>
<p>Sister-in-law Wen leaned forward and backward, bouncing on the bamboo chair, which cried out fiercely as if it could not hold her. Mr. Feng Wen knew that he had encountered bad luck today. So he gave up the national curse tactic, picked a fair criticism, and shouted "Shrew! Shrew!" while turning his head and sending his two feet to the aisle.</p>
<p>The son, Rugang, was like a little mud pig, rolling around on the street. His black face was groping and picking things, as if he found it very interesting. Probably, he didn't know that he was the son of a village chief! What an unlucky year!</p>
<p>He stood in the street in front of the door for a while, and when he heard the crying inside the house subside, he felt a little more at ease.</p>
<p>"Damn it, there's really nothing to say!" This time, Mr. Feng Wen shot a cold arrow at his own heart. "Isn't it true that you're worried about starving to death even if you're a village chief? What kind of world is this?"</p>
<p>Thinking about it, he turned his eyes to the street.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Elaboration on Treating Typhoid Fever 4 (The Greater Yang Stage) (Part 2) <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Yunzhou</p>
<p>Cinnamon Twig Decoction (Gui Zhi Tang) can induce sweating. Although this is not explicitly stated in the original scripture, it is mentioned in other records. Moreover, it is evident in Zhang Zhongjing's writings, as the instances of using Cinnamon Twig Decoction to induce sweating are numerous. For example, in the upper section of the Greater Yang Stage, it says, "If after taking Cinnamon Twig Decoction, profuse sweating occurs, and the pulse is surging and large, administer Cinnamon Twig Decoction again according to the previous method." It also says, "If after taking Cinnamon Twig Decoction, profuse sweating occurs, followed by great thirst that cannot be relieved, and the pulse is surging and large, administer White Tiger Decoction with Ginseng." These all indicate that Cinnamon Twig Decoction causes profuse sweating, meaning it not only induces sweating but also induces profuse sweating. This is the "like water flowing away" effect mentioned in the instructions for taking Cinnamon Twig Decoction.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the middle section of the Greater Yang Stage, it says, "If the external symptoms of Greater Yang disease have not been resolved, and the pulse is floating and weak, sweating should be induced to resolve it. Cinnamon Twig Decoction is appropriate." It also says, "If the patient often sweats spontaneously, this is because the Nutritive Qi (Rong Qi) is harmonious. When the Nutritive Qi is harmonious, there is disharmony externally, because the Defensive Qi (Wei Qi) is not in harmony with the Nutritive Qi... Induce sweating again, and when the Nutritive and Defensive Qi are harmonized, the condition will be cured. Cinnamon Twig Decoction is appropriate." It also says, "If the patient has no other underlying illness, but experiences intermittent fever and spontaneous sweating that does not resolve, this is due to disharmony of the Defensive Qi. Induce sweating before the fever occurs, and the condition will be cured. Cinnamon Twig Decoction is appropriate." It also says, "If, in typhoid fever, there has been no bowel movement for six or seven days, and there is headache and fever, administer Purgative Decoction (Cheng Qi Tang). If the urine is clear, it indicates that the condition is not internal but remains external. Sweating must be induced. If there is headache, there will be bleeding from the nose. Cinnamon Twig Decoction is appropriate." It also says, "If, in typhoid fever, sweating has resolved the condition, but after about half a day, irritability returns, and the pulse is floating and rapid, sweating can be induced again. Cinnamon Twig Decoction is appropriate."</p>
<p>In the Yang Brightness Stage section, it says, "In Yang Brightness disease, if the pulse is slow, there is profuse sweating, and slight aversion to cold, the exterior has not been resolved. Sweating can be induced. Cinnamon Twig Decoction is appropriate." It also says, "If the patient is irritable and feverish, and sweating resolves the condition, and the fever occurs at dusk, resembling malaria, it belongs to the Yang Brightness Stage. If the pulse is solid, purgation is appropriate; if the pulse is floating and empty, sweating is appropriate. Purgation should be done with Purgative Decoction, and sweating should be induced with Cinnamon Twig Decoction."</p>
<p>In the Greater Yin Stage section, it says, "In Greater Yin disease, if the pulse is floating, sweating can be induced. Cinnamon Twig Decoction is appropriate." These are all explicit statements by Zhang Zhongjing regarding the use of Cinnamon Twig Decoction to induce sweating.</p>
<p>Furthermore, at the end of the upper section of the Greater Yang Stage, there is the phrase "increase cinnamon to induce sweating." In the middle section of the Greater Yang Stage, the modifications to Minor Bupleurum Decoction state, "If there is no thirst and slight fever externally, remove ginseng and add three ounces of cinnamon. Cover warmly to induce slight sweating, and the condition will be cured." This is an explicit statement about increasing cinnamon to induce sweating.</p>
<p>However, in the Treatise on Cold Damage, there are also passages such as Cinnamon Twig Decoction with Aconite is used for incessant sweating after inducing sweating, Cinnamon Twig and Licorice Decoction is used for excessive sweating, and Cinnamon Twig and Two Parts Ogre Food Decoction One Part Ephedra Decoction is used when Yang Qi is insufficient and sweating should not be induced. Consequently, there is doubt whether cinnamon is a sweating-inducing herb. Therefore, Wang Haizang believed that cinnamon could neither open the pores to release sweat nor close the sweat pores, attributing its function to harmonizing the Nutritive and Defensive Qi. If the Nutritive and Defensive Qi themselves are not clearly understood and defined, the notion of harmonizing them becomes even more elusive. How audacious the old physicians were to fabricate such absurdities! However, this is not Haizang's fault but Zhongjing's. Zhang Zhongjing's Treatise on Cold Damage contains many contradictory statements.</p>
<p>Regarding the Nutritive and Defensive Qi, in the middle section of the Greater Yang Stage, it says, "If the patient often sweats spontaneously, this is because the Nutritive Qi is harmonious. When the Nutritive Qi is harmonious, there is disharmony externally, because the Defensive Qi is not in harmony with the Nutritive Qi... Induce sweating again, and when the Nutritive and Defensive Qi are harmonized, the condition will be cured. Cinnamon Twig Decoction is appropriate." It also says, "If the patient has no other underlying illness, but experiences intermittent fever and spontaneous sweating that does not resolve, this is due to disharmony of the Defensive Qi. Induce sweating before the fever occurs, and the condition will be cured. Cinnamon Twig Decoction is appropriate." This suggests that spontaneous sweating indicates harmonious Nutritive Qi and disharmonious Defensive Qi, and that inducing sweating harmonizes the Defensive Qi. The Nutritive Qi is inherently harmonious, so there is no need for harmonization.</p>
<p>In the upper section of the Greater Yang Stage, it says, "In Greater Yang Wind-Strike, the Yang is floating and the Yin is weak. Floating Yang causes fever, and weak Yin causes spontaneous sweating." This suggests that spontaneous sweating indicates weak Yin. In old medical books, the terms "Yin" and "Yang" are used very broadly, sometimes referring to blood and Qi, Nutritive and Defensive Qi, and sometimes referring to the pulse. In this passage, "Yin" and "Yang" refer to the pulse, which also implies referring to the Nutritive Qi or blood. How do we know this? Because this passage contrasts "weak" with "floating," and floating is a pulse sign, indicating that weak is also a pulse sign.</p>
<p>However, in the middle section of the Greater Yang Stage, it says, "If purgation is performed and the patient experiences heaviness in the body and palpitations, sweating should not be induced. Spontaneous sweating should occur to resolve the condition. The reason is that the cubit pulse is weak, indicating internal deficiency. The exterior and interior must be substantial, and the fluids will naturally harmonize, leading to spontaneous sweating and recovery." It also says, "If the cubit pulse is slow, sweating should not be induced. How do we know this? Because the Nutritive Qi is insufficient, and there is a deficiency of blood." Observing these two passages, we know that sweating should not be induced because the cubit pulse is weak and slow. The reason is attributed to internal deficiency and insufficient Nutritive Qi, further explained as a deficiency of blood. Therefore, what is meant by "internal deficiency" is nothing more than insufficient Nutritive Qi, or, in essence, a deficiency of blood.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the upper section of the Greater Yang Stage, it says, "If the pulse is weak and there is aversion to cold, this indicates that both Yin and Yang are deficient, and sweating, vomiting, or purgation should not be induced again." Cheng Wuji's commentary states, "Yang refers to the exterior, and Yin refers to the interior. A weak pulse indicates internal deficiency, and aversion to cold indicates external deficiency." Therefore, a weak pulse and internal deficiency are synonymous with Yin deficiency and Yin weakness, which also means insufficient Nutritive Qi and a deficiency of blood.</p>
<p>In the middle section of the Greater Yang Stage, it says, "In Greater Yang disease, if there is fever and sweating, this indicates that the Nutritive Qi is weak and the Defensive Qi is strong, causing sweating. To alleviate the pathogenic wind, Cinnamon Twig Decoction is appropriate." This indicates that weak Yin is equivalent to weak Nutritive Qi. Therefore, I say that the Yin and Yang in the previous passage refer to the pulse, but also to Qi and blood, Nutritive and Defensive Qi. The so-called Yin is the Nutritive Qi. However, observing Zhang Zhongjing's writings, it says, "Weak Yin causes spontaneous sweating," and "Spontaneous sweating indicates that the Nutritive Qi is harmonious." Xu Huixi states, "Harmonious Nutritive Qi means the Nutritive Qi is not diseased." If weak Yin means insufficient Nutritive Qi, then does insufficient Nutritive Qi mean that the Nutritive Qi is not diseased? This is a contradiction in the Treatise on Cold Damage regarding the Nutritive and Defensive Qi.</p>
<p>Regarding the use of cinnamon, in the upper section of the Greater Yang Stage, it says, "Cinnamon is primarily for resolving the muscles. If the person has a floating and tight pulse, fever, and no sweating, it should not be administered. This must always be recognized and not mistakenly used." This indicates that cinnamon should not be used without sweating, a profound warning. However, in the instructions for Cinnamon Twig Decoction, it says, "It is even better if the entire body feels warm and there is a slight hint of sweat." This means that even the slightest hint of sweat is absent before taking the decoction. I do not know if the so-called spontaneous sweating is even slighter than the slightest hint of sweat. It also says, "If there is no sweating, take it again according to the previous method. If there is still no sweating, take the next dose sooner." It also says, "If sweating does not occur, take up to two or three doses." I do not know how to differentiate the absence of sweating that contraindicates the use of Cinnamon Twig Decoction from the absence of sweating that requires taking two or three doses.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the middle section of the Greater Yang Stage, it says, "After inducing sweating, Cinnamon Twig Decoction should not be administered again. If there is sweating and wheezing without high fever, Ephedra, Apricot Kernel, Licorice, and Gypsum Decoction can be administered." Ke Yunbo states, "Zhang Zhongjing often uses Cinnamon Twig Decoction to induce sweating again when the exterior is not resolved after sweating or purgation." He also says, "Administering Cinnamon Twig Decoction again when the exterior is not resolved after sweating or purgation is a common method for treating wind-cold." From this, it can be seen that the statement "After inducing sweating, Cinnamon Twig Decoction should not be administered again" is contradictory. If it is because of wheezing, then thickening the Cinnamon Twig Decoction and adding Magnolia Bark and Apricot Kernel is appropriate. If it is because of sweating, then Cinnamon Twig Decoction should be used. Why abandon cinnamon and use ephedra? If it is because there is no high fever, why use gypsum? These are all based on old theories and are not understandable. Therefore, Ke changed "sweating and wheezing" to "no sweating and wheezing" to align with the ephedra in the formula and changed "no high fever" to "high fever" to align with the gypsum in the formula. Although his explanation is not entirely accurate, he recognizes that it is not understandable. Chen Xiuyuan claimed that the wheezing is the wheezing characteristic of ephedra's indication, that sweating is the absence of sweating characteristic of ephedra's indication, and that the absence of high fever is because the heat is suppressed internally, rising to the surface, making the external heat appear lighter. Although his explanation is also not entirely accurate, he recognizes that it is not understandable. However, although there are many explanations, none can be found that are entirely without regrets. This is simply because Zhongjing himself is contradictory, and later scholars cannot rectify it. Zhongjing's writings contain many contradictions, and they are especially prominent in the discussion of Cinnamon Twig Decoction. Yan Jing Liao Ping even suggests that Cinnamon Twig Decoction is not a single formula but that there must be several formulas with the same name, similar to how Purgative Decoction has Major Purgative Decoction, Minor Purgative Decoction, and Stomach-Regulating Purgative Decoction. Therefore, he gathered nineteen formulas from the Golden Mirror of Medical Prescriptions, such as Four-Ingredient Cinnamon Twig Decoction and Five-Ingredient Cinnamon Twig Decoction, to support this claim, believing that this would clarify the explanation of Cinnamon Twig Decoction. Although his theory is novel, unless we could revive Zhang Zhongjing and ask him, who could believe whether it is true or not?</p>
<h3 id="e41">Relapsing Fever <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— Yizhi</p>
<p>Recently, Professor Liu Fu (Bannong) of Peking University passed away due to illness. He died of relapsing fever. When the illness started, he only had some fever. Because there were no testing facilities locally, the cause of his illness could not be determined. It was only after returning to Beiping that relapsing fever was diagnosed, but it was already too late. Many people are blaming new medicine for this, but in reality, it was because there was no new medicine that Mr. Liu was sacrificed. If there had been good testing facilities locally, blood could have been drawn and tested immediately to identify the cause of the illness and provide treatment. Then, would Mr. Liu not still be on the podium at Peking University today? This makes us realize the importance of new medicine, especially the need for new medicine and pharmaceuticals in rural areas. We must recognize that countless others have been sacrificed under similar circumstances. Mr. Liu was just one of them.</p>
<p>Relapsing fever is an acute infectious disease. Its pathogen was discovered in 1873 by Obermeier, and it is a spiral-shaped bacterium. The route of entry into the human body is usually through the bites of mosquitoes, lice, or bedbugs, because these bacteria are often found in the excrement of these insects. After a person is bitten, they scratch the itchy area, and the bacteria enter the body. Furthermore, the saliva, tears, milk, urine, and other secretions of people with relapsing fever also contain the bacteria, making the route of transmission even wider. Air, daily necessities, bedding, and so on can all be mediums of transmission.</p>
<p>After the bacteria enter the body, symptoms appear after about five to eight days. The initial symptoms include headache, back pain, and chills, gradually progressing to body aches. The body temperature rises to 40 to 41 degrees Celsius (102 to 105 degrees Fahrenheit). The temperature fluctuates, but the difference is not significant. Usually, after six or seven days, profuse sweating occurs, and the fever subsides. However, after a few days (approximately four to fourteen days, depending on the case), the same symptoms reappear. After another six or seven days, the fever subsides again. After a few more days, the fever returns, and the cycle repeats. That is why it is called relapsing fever. The second and third occurrences of fever are usually milder than the first. Some people recover on their own after two or three occurrences; otherwise, they may die from heart failure or related lung and liver diseases.</p>
<p>If we encounter such patients, we should immediately test their blood. If they have relapsing fever, the spiral bacteria will be found in their blood.</p>
<p>Currently, the most common treatment method is the injection of Salvarsan (914). Usually, the fever subsides after one injection. In addition, mild symptomatic medications can be used for back pain, headache, vomiting, constipation, and so on, and recovery is easily achieved.</p>
<p>This disease does not confer immunity, so there is still a possibility of a second infection after having it once.</p>
<p>The prevention method lies entirely in public health measures. We should pay attention to those who are ill. Once such a patient is found, immediate measures should be taken to isolate them. All utensils used by the patient should be disinfected immediately. The patient's excrement should not be left exposed. If this is done, the bacteria will have no chance of survival, and mosquitoes and other insects will have nothing to spread.</p>

<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(39) Hookworm (also known as Duodenal Worm)</p>
<p>(Q) What kind of worm is a hookworm?</p>
<p>(A) A hookworm is a type of worm that parasitizes the upper part of the small intestine, especially the duodenum, which is where they live. Therefore, it is also known as a duodenal worm.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>(Q) What does a hookworm look like?</p>
<p>(A) Male hookworms are 10 mm long, and female hookworms are 18 mm long. Their mouths have hooks and teeth that they use to tightly grip the mucous membrane of the intestinal wall to parasitize it.</p>
<p>(Q) What do hookworm eggs look like?</p>
<p>(A) The eggs are oval-shaped, and their contents contain numerous cleavage globules. The eggshell is thin and colorless.</p>
<p>(Q) What symptoms occur after hookworms parasitize the human intestinal tract?</p>
<p>(A) People parasitized by hookworms often develop severe anemia, with symptoms such as general fatigue, headache, rapid heartbeat, dizziness, tinnitus, swollen skin, pale complexion, heart murmurs, and murmurs in the jugular vein.</p>
<p>(Q) Are there any abnormalities in the feces excreted by the patient?</p>
<p>(A) The feces of hookworm patients contain worm eggs, eosinophils, Charcot-Leyden crystals, and occult blood.</p>
<p>(Q) What symptoms does the patient experience?</p>
<p>(A) Patients often complain of thirst, decreased appetite, nausea, abdominal pain, and bloating.</p>
<p>(Q) What are some medications for expelling hookworms?</p>
<p>(A) Carbon tetrachloride, thymol, oil of chenopodium, etc.</p>
<p>(Q) How is carbon tetrachloride used?</p>
<p>(A) On the day before deworming, give the patient some semi-liquid foods such as milk, egg broth, and thin porridge. At 10:00 AM, administer castor oil or magnesium sulfate internally to ensure that the intestines are thoroughly cleansed. On the day of deworming, take 3 cubic centimeters of carbon tetrachloride in capsules in the morning. After two hours, take another 20-30 grams of magnesium sulfate. Continue this for several days to completely expel the worms. Regular food can be eaten as usual and does not need the same attention as on the first day.</p>
<p>(Q) What should be avoided when taking carbon tetrachloride?</p>
<p>(A) Avoid fats and alcohol.</p>
<p>(Q) How is thymol used?</p>
<p>(A) Prepare for deworming the day before using thymol. On the morning of the deworming day, take 4 grams of thymol and 2 grams of naphthalene, divided into two packets. Take the first packet, and two hours later, take castor oil once. After the bowel movement, take the second packet.</p>
<p>(Q) Are there any things to avoid when taking this medication?</p>
<p>(A) Because alcohol dissolves thymol, it should also be avoided.</p>
<p>(Q) How is oil of chenopodium used?</p>
<p>(A) Prepare for deworming the day before. In the morning on an empty stomach, take 20 drops of oil of chenopodium in a capsule, all at once. Two hours later, take castor oil to expel the worms.</p>

<p>(15) External Auditory Canal Inflammation (Ear Boil)</p>
<p>External auditory canal inflammation (otitis externa) is one of the most common ear diseases. We often encounter it in our clinical practice, and it is somewhat more common in women. It usually occurs on one side, and rarely on both sides. The main cause is the invasion of pyogenic bacteria (such as staphylococcus) into the sebaceous glands or ceruminous glands of the skin of the external auditory canal. However, the skin of the external auditory canal has its own resistance that can prevent the invasion of pyogenic bacteria. However, this resistance can sometimes weaken or be completely absent. At this time, pyogenic bacteria can invade. There are many reasons for weakened or absent resistance. Usually, it can be divided into: 1. Mechanical irritation, such as scratching the external auditory canal (self-cleaning with ear picks or barbers using small knives to scrape the ear, etc.). 2. Chemical and thermal irritation. 3. Irritation from pus draining from suppurative otitis media. 4. Unclean water entering the ear during swimming.</p>
<p>The main symptom of this disease is usually the onset of ear pain. Ear pain is usually more severe at night than during the day, and can even interfere with sleep. The pain is more severe if the earlobe is pulled or the outer opening of the ear is pressed. Sometimes, it feels difficult to open the mouth and inconvenient to chew. At this time, if the external auditory canal is examined with an otoscope, localized tenderness and redness and swelling of the affected area can often be detected. The patient often has fever and listlessness. If the swelling increases, the external auditory canal can be completely blocked, thus hindering hearing. At the same time, the area in front of or behind the ear often becomes red and swollen, and may even suppurate.</p>
<p>The course of this disease is about one week, but it is easily recurring. It can often develop into diffuse external auditory canal inflammation (otitis externa diffusa). At this time, the wall of the external auditory canal is particularly red and swollen. First, the epidermis peels off, and then ulcers form. The surface is very moist, and the secretion is serous or purulent, often mixed with exfoliated epidermal cells and earwax, forming a dirty, muddy substance with a foul odor. Secretion stops only when healing is imminent. The skin surface of the external auditory canal gradually dries.</p>
<p>The most important prevention method for external auditory canal inflammation is to prevent the invasion of pyogenic bacteria. Avoid irritation of the external auditory canal (abandon the habit of indiscriminate ear picking). Pay attention to the intrusion of dirty water into the ear. If suppurative otitis media already exists, it should be treated immediately to eliminate the pus. If the external auditory canal ever feels painful and swollen, it should be diagnosed and treated by a specialist immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Physician's Code of Conduct of the Chinese Medical Association <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Duties of a Physician</p>
<p>Article 1: A physician's primary objective is to serve the people.</p>
<p>Article 2: A physician's daily life should be moderate, and they must possess sound physical and mental health to perform their duties.</p>
<p>Essentials of Medical Practice</p>
<p>Article 3: Nobility of Medical Practice: Those engaged in medicine should enhance their academic skills, uphold their noble status, and realize their ideals.</p>
<p>Article 4: Foundation of Medical Practice: Physicians should not practice medicine solely based on dogmatic theories, nor should they rely on doctrines contrary to mainstream global medical science.</p>
<p>Article 5: Unnecessary or Improper Surgery</p>
<p>Application of methods in practice must be generally recognized by the medical community. All unnecessary or improper surgeries should not be performed. Permitting, advising, or performing abortions is against medical ethics. However, in special circumstances, after consultation with other physicians of profound scholarship and integrity, if it is deemed necessary to perform surgery to preserve the mother's life, it may be performed.</p>
<p>Article 6: Respect for Chinese Customs: Foreign physicians practicing in China should not offend Chinese customs and the feelings of the people, especially female patients. When performing an autopsy after a patient's death, Chinese law must be followed, obtaining consent from the deceased's family first, and then submitting a request to the local authorities for approval before execution.</p>
<p>Article 7: Physician's Fees: The fees charged by a physician should be based on the prevailing medical rates in their locality. Remuneration and proper treatment of the patient are two separate issues and should not be intertwined. In particular, one should not sacrifice professional standing or violate public interest due to remuneration issues.</p>
<p>Article 8: No Private Sharing of Commissions: Giving or receiving commissions is detrimental to public interest and degrades the medical profession, which is incompatible with professional ethics. In the event of consultations or surgical treatments, unless the patient or their friends understand the conditions of the agreement, any mutual sharing of commissions is also incompatible with professional ethics.</p>
<p>Article 9: Advertising: Publishing leaflets or advertisements, or using solicitation or interviews to attract patients, is incompatible with professional ethics. Even indirect publicity through referrals or exaggerated claims of therapeutic efficacy in daily newspapers and magazines is also incompatible with professional ethics. Matters such as guaranteeing cures, collecting fees in advance, boasting secret remedies, exaggerating achievements, or using other methods to attract public attention in order to solicit patients are all inappropriate for a physician. However, printing business cards for convenience is a matter of personal preference, and according to local custom, it cannot be considered improper if it is handled appropriately.</p>
<p>Article 10: Secret Remedies and Proprietary Medicines: Using self-prepared medicines</p>
<p>to treat illnesses, or manufacturing, selling, and promoting various self-prepared medicines to profit is incompatible with medical ethics. Receiving a share of profits from patented drugs or various medical and surgical instruments is also incompatible with medical ethics. As for patients bringing prescriptions for dispensing, recommending patients, or submitting specimens for testing, physicians must not secretly receive kickbacks.</p>
<p>Article 11: Certificates: Physicians must not issue false or misleading certificates.</p>
<p>Physician's Responsibility to the Patient</p>
<p>Article 12: Physician's Responsibility: Physicians should not only be prepared to answer a patient's call at any time but also be aware of the nobility of their duty and the weight of their responsibility. During a consultation, they must know that the patient's health and life depend entirely on their skill and proficiency, and they should be extremely cautious and not negligent. For the sake of the patient, they should make every effort to adhere to the scheduled consultation time.</p>
<p>Article 13: Consultation: In the event of difficult or doubtful symptoms, the attending physician should request consultation with other physicians. If the patient or their representative invites other physicians for consultation, the attending physician should also express their agreement.</p>
<p>Article 14: Maintaining Patient's Trust: When diagnosing and treating each patient, one should concentrate their mind and deliberate carefully, maintaining the trust already gained with an attitude of honesty and sincerity. Except as required by law, physicians should not disclose a patient's secrets or speak lavishly of their personal failings or family scandals after a consultation. However, in the case of venereal diseases or other infectious diseases, physicians have a responsibility to protect the patient's family and society from the risk of infection.</p>
<p>Article 15: Treatment of Incurable Diseases: Physicians should not refrain from treating a patient simply because the illness is considered incurable. Treating even when it is known to be incurable aims to reduce the patient's suffering.</p>
<p>Article 16: Obligatory Service: Physicians should recognize that providing medical care to poor patients is a common principle throughout history, both in China and abroad, but this does not apply to foundations, organizations, or life insurance institutions.</p>
<p>Physicians' Right to Receive Free Medical Treatment from Other Physicians</p>
<p>Article 17: Physicians themselves and their immediate family members are entitled to free medical treatment from neighboring physicians. When several physicians treat one person, one of them should preside.</p>
<p>Article 18: When a physician is called to visit a colleague or a colleague's family, the travel expenses and business losses should be borne by the patient's family.</p>
<p>Relationship Between Physicians and Patients Treated by Other Physicians</p>
<p>Article 19: Maintaining Confidentiality in Medical Matters: In ordinary social interactions, physicians should maintain strict confidentiality regarding patients treated by other physicians. It is best not to inquire about the cause of the illness or the state of treatment. Even if there is a desire to inquire, one should not make derogatory insinuations or engage in direct or indirect actions to diminish the patient's faith in their attending physician.</p>
<p>Article 20: Change of Physician: Physicians who are hired to visit a patient already being treated by another physician should not accept the case or prescribe medication, except in the following circumstances: accidental events, the original physician is unwilling to continue treatment, or the patient's family is unwilling to continue engaging the original physician.</p>
<p>Article 21: Appointment of a Substitute: If a physician temporarily leaves due to circumstances, when engaging another physician as a substitute, it should be accepted as a matter of professional courtesy if there is no conflict of interest. After accepting another's appointment, one should do their best to consider the interests and reputation of the one who appointed them and return the patient to them upon their return.</p>
<p>Article 22: Emergencies: When a physician is called for an emergency, either because the family physician cannot arrive in time or because the condition has worsened, their task is limited to providing emergency care. After the family physician arrives, they should inform them of the patient's condition and treatment methods in detail before taking their leave.</p>
<p>Article 23: Obstetric Emergencies: If the originally scheduled obstetrician has not arrived and a visiting physician completes the delivery, the consultation fee should belong to the substituting physician. However, when the originally scheduled physician arrives and with the consent of the family, the substituting physician may respectfully withdraw.</p>
<p>Article 24: Multiple Physicians Invited for Emergencies: In cases of emergency or accidental events, the patient's family often invites several physicians. The invited physicians should advise the patient's family to engage their family physician, and they should take their leave after the family physician arrives.</p>
<p>Consultation</p>
<p>Article 25: Adhering to Consultation Time: Consultation appointments should be strictly adhered to, and one should not break the appointment except in cases of emergency.</p>
<p>Article 26: Consultation Conduct: During consultation, emotions such as vanity, exclusion, and jealousy should be avoided. Due respect should be given to the attending physician, and one should not undermine their credibility with their words.</p>
<p>Article 27: Changes in Treatment Methods: The course of illness is unpredictable, and the attending physician may change their treatment methods without being bound by any prior decision. However, they should explain the reasons for the change at the next consultation. This change can also be made by the consulting physician. The attending physician may prescribe medication for the patient at any time, while the consulting physician may not prescribe medication except in cases of emergency.</p>
<p>Article 28: Disagreement in Diagnosis: If the attending physician and the consulting physician have differing opinions during the diagnosis, another physician should be invited for consultation.</p>
<p>Article 29: Consulting Physician Should Not Accept the Case: Physicians who are invited for consultation should not accept the attending physician's case, even at the request of the patient or their relatives and friends.</p>
<p>Article 30: Referring Patients to Specialists: When the attending physician refers a patient to a specialist, they should attach the medical records. After examination, the specialist should convey their opinion to the attending physician.</p>
<p>Arbitration of Professional Disputes</p>
<p>Article 31: Physicians often have disagreements and conflicts of interest due to differing opinions, leading to disputes. When these cannot be resolved, they should seek arbitration from the medical organization they belong to.</p>
<p>Physicians' Responsibilities to the Nation</p>
<p>Article 32: Assisting in Public Health Undertakings</p>
<p>Physicians consider obedience to laws and respect for social customs as their duty. In order to assist in promoting public health, they should abide by all health regulations.</p>
<p>Article 33: Preventing Infectious Diseases: When needed, physicians should guide patients on quarantine regulations and methods of preventing infectious diseases, and report the infectious diseases they diagnose and treat to the health authorities. In the event of an epidemic, physicians should continue to serve without avoiding danger, with the primary objective of alleviating suffering, even at the risk of their lives.</p>
<p>Article 34: Lawsuits: Regarding lawsuits involving medical matters, physicians should convene a meeting in advance to study the case so that there will be facts to cite in court in the future.</p>
<p>Article 35: Protecting Professional Practice: To protect their professional practice, physicians should avoid cooperating with those of bad character and insufficient knowledge.</p>
<p>Relationship Between Physicians and Nurses</p>
<p>Article 36: Regarding the treatment of diseases or injuries, physicians bear full responsibility, whether in a hospital or clinic. As for the duties of nurses, they should faithfully obey the physician's instructions without discrimination based on the physician's nationality. Nurses must not change the treatment without the physician's permission. Physicians should not be arrogant or unreasonable toward nurses, especially in front of patients.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Article 37: The above sections do not mean that physicians' responsibilities to patients, colleagues, the profession, and the public are limited to these alone, nor does it mean that the scope of medical ethics is limited to this. In short, physicians should treat patients, the public, and their colleagues with a kind attitude at all times, putting themselves in others' shoes and acting with compassion and empathy. The provisions of this article are premised on the interests of the public and will surely gain the sympathy of society.</p>
<h3 id="e45">A Brief Discussion on Pulmonary Tuberculosis (XXI) <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>What is the condition of hemoptysis in pulmonary tuberculosis? It can occur in any stage of the disease. Its form is individual small streaks of blood, mixed with purulent sputum. Sometimes the quantity is relatively increased, almost several spoonfuls, which is foamy fresh blood, usually expelled after several violent short coughs. In most cases, it can also be about one liter, similar to the situation of stomach bleeding. This kind of massive hemorrhage is only seen in severe cavernous changes and extremely advanced diseases, and its examples are much less than the former. After a patient experiences a bleeding episode, their sputum will also have a slight blood tinge, which gradually decreases and returns to normal after a few days. There are also many examples of repeated hemoptysis. Before these patients experience an episode, they often feel a strange itch in their throat, or even a sweet and bloody smell, which is undoubtedly a precursor. Patients who have experienced repeated hemoptysis are prone to developing severe anemia. After hemoptysis occurs, the temperature may increase, and the pulse rate may also increase. This phenomenon usually gradually decreases after three to five days, which is called hemoptysis (blood heat). However, if the fever persists or even increases significantly, it indicates that the disease is progressing and invading somewhere. Sometimes it can also induce acute miliary tuberculosis. The prognosis in this aspect is certainly not comparable to the former.</p>
<p>The symptom of hemoptysis is easily confused with common hematemesis (i.e., stomach bleeding). In fact, the underlying diseases of these two aspects are completely different. Their simple identification methods are also worth mentioning here. The blood in hemoptysis is bright red, foamy, and does not clot; the blood in hematemesis is dark or black, non-foamy, and often clots into round masses. Hemoptysis is mixed with mucus and pus; hematemesis is mixed with food components. Hemoptysis has an alkaline reaction, and hematemesis has an acidic reaction. Apart from the differences in the discharge itself, the blood in hemoptysis is discharged by coughing, and there are also symptoms of lung and heart disease; the blood in hematemesis is discharged by vomiting, and most have symptoms of stomach and liver disease. These few differences are very obvious, and even the patient themselves can easily distinguish them; however, actual variations are still very common. In cases of massive pulmonary hemorrhage, some blood may also be swallowed and then vomited out again. If the blood stays in the stomach for too long, it can change from bright red and foamy to brown. In this way, it is almost the same as stomach bleeding; not only will the patient misunderstand, but even the doctor may not be able to distinguish it clearly for a while. This completely relies on precise local examinations of these two aspects to reveal the truth.</p>
<p>Apart from pulmonary tuberculosis, other conditions such as lung tumors, pulmonary embolism, heart valve disease, and bronchiectasis can sometimes cause hemoptysis; however, it is far less common than pulmonary tuberculosis. We might as well say that if a patient is found to have hemoptysis, although it is not necessarily pulmonary tuberculosis, it is most likely to be attributed to this disease. As for pulmonary tuberculosis itself, not everyone experiences hemoptysis. According to recent statistics, it is only about a quarter of the number. Among the patients treated by the author, there are many who never experience hemoptysis at all. In the early stages of the disease, hemoptysis occurs in about 10% of cases, and there are many examples where it does not occur a second time. In short, patients who experience hemoptysis are almost all suspected of having pulmonary tuberculosis; however, those who have not experienced it cannot be said not to have pulmonary tuberculosis. This truth should be clearly recognized by everyone.</p>

<h3 id="e46">Remedies for the Dumping of Japanese Aquatic Products <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— Ruo Qian</p>
<p>The dumping of Japanese aquatic products and the resulting harm to our country's fishing industry have been discussed in previous articles. (See the article "A Review of the Dumping of Japanese Aquatic Products" in this publication.) The only way to prevent it is through tariffs, which is a temporary solution. However, after much struggle, our country has only recently achieved tariff autonomy, and many of the key customs officials are foreigners.</p>
<p>Aquatic products hold an important place in people's diets. Salted and dried fish, in particular, are common among the lower and middle classes, while shark fins and sea cucumbers have, by social convention, become prestigious items for entertaining guests. Domestic production is insufficient, and we rely on foreign goods. Over time, the guest has become the host, and our domestic marine products have gradually declined. Imported marine products have gained an important position in trade, especially those from Japan, which have penetrated every corner. Year after year, the livelihood of coastal fishermen will be completely ruined.</p>
<p>Various tariffs on aquatic products were established in the 6th year of the Xianfeng reign (1856), mostly based on an ad valorem rate of 5%. Even quantitative tariffs were based on this standard. As a result of the Washington Conference, surtaxes were allowed. Later, in the tariff schedules proposed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, abalone, spiky black sea cucumber, smooth black sea cucumber, white sea cucumber, dried scallops, fish maw, fish spine fins, fish chest fins, shark fins, etc., were all considered luxury goods, with a tax rate of 10%. In the revised tariff schedule of the 11th year of the Republic (1922), the tax rates on aquatic products were also greatly increased. The promulgated national tariff schedule of the 19th year of the Republic (1930) showed even more significant increases. There was another revision in the 22nd year (1933). Now, a table listing the historical tariffs on aquatic products is compiled as follows:</p>

<p>Note: Tax rates revised in the 22nd year (1933) are calculated in gold units.</p>
<p>The promulgation of the national tariff schedule in the 19th year (1930) was the result of lifting Japan's obstruction to our country's tariff autonomy and establishing the Sino-Japanese Tariff Reciprocity Agreement. However, in the Sino-Japanese Tariff Reciprocity Agreement, Japan considered China its only export market for aquatic products and insisted on including them in the reciprocity list. As a result, it was stipulated in the second item of the annex, which allowed most of the Japanese aquatic products that were imported in the greatest quantity and caused the greatest pressure to bypass the national tariff schedule through the agreement. Therefore, the import of Japanese aquatic products has been particularly intense in recent years, which needs to be examined. If we compare them, the agreement's tariff rates are much lower than the national tariff rates. Except for unlisted salted fish, kelp threads, and kelp, which are the same, the white sea cucumber is reduced by 46%, and even canned abalone, which is reduced the least, is reduced by 27%. In addition, there are reductions of 42%, 38%, 33%, 31%, 29%, and 28%. If compared with the revised tariff rates of the 22nd year (1933), they are indeed much higher, which can greatly impact Japanese products. The highest is dried scallops, which increased from 9.10 per dan under the agreement's tariff to 29.00 per dan, an actual increase of 218.68%. Even kelp threads, which had the lowest increase, increased by 77%. A table is now presented below to illustrate this.</p>

<p>Comparing the import values, the average monthly import value of Japanese aquatic products during the agreement's tariff period was 19.8% higher than the average monthly import value during the revised tariff schedule period of the 22nd year (1933). (See the article "A Study of the New Customs Import Tariff" in the China Bank Monthly, Volume 9, Issue 2.) If we compare each item (to facilitate comparison, we will examine the total imports of the recent two years, 1932 and 1933), it is even more evident that imports during the agreement period increased much more than after the revision. For example, in 1932, 379,785 dan of kelp were imported, worth 1,151,755 gold units, while in 1931, there were only 195,981 dan, worth 457,053 gold units, a decrease of almost three times. Moreover, the figures for 1933 include a portion of imports still under the agreement's tariff schedule, which shows that the agreement's tariff schedule greatly assisted the import of Japanese aquatic products. A table of the import figures for aquatic products related to the agreement is now presented below, which is sufficient to prove this.</p>

<p>The above table shows the huge proportion of Japanese products in our country's total aquatic imports. This is because the Japanese took advantage of the agreement's tariffs to import smoothly. Therefore, in the analysis of our country's aquatic import countries, Japanese products outweigh any other country. If we take the average of the import figures during the agreement's tariff period, Japanese products account for 68%. However, during the tariff schedule period of the 22nd year (1933) (until the end of May of the 23rd year (1934)), Japanese products accounted for only 46.5% of the total, which shows that the agreement's tariff schedule favored the import of Japanese products. It also shows that the increase or decrease of aquatic product tariffs is closely related to the import of Japanese products.</p>
<p>Recently, in order to increase revenue, the tariff schedule was re-revised and promulgated on July 1st. In this revised import tariff schedule, the sixth category, fish and shellfish marine products, still has 25 items. Among them, salted sardines, salted salmon, and unlisted salted fish have been changed from quantitative taxes to ad valorem taxes. Abalone, sea cucumber, dried scallops, squid/cuttlefish, kelp threads, kelp, and six other items have had their tax rates reduced. The most significant reduction is for kelp threads in item 292, which has been reduced from 2.30 per 100 kg to 1.70, a decrease of 35.7%. A table listing the tax reductions for several items is shown below:</p>
<p>Item               Unit       Year 22 Tariff Rate   Year 23 Revised Tariff Rate   Percentage Reduction from Original Tariff Rate</p>

<p>278 Dried Scallops       …          48.00             40.00                      20.0</p>
<p>282 Squid/Cuttlefish        …          17.00             14.00                      3.4</p>
<p>292 Kelp Threads           …          2.30              1.70                       35.2</p>
<p>293 Kelp               …          1.70              1.30                       30.7</p>
<p>Kelp threads, which have the most significant reduction, had an import value of 1.15 million gold units for 380,000 dan in 1932. In 1933, due to the increased tariff rate, it dropped to 200,000 dan, worth 460,000 gold units. This July (1934), there was a large increase in imports, with over 6,000 dan imported in just one month! This shows the immediate effect! According to historical statistics, Japanese products account for over 99% of all imports. Furthermore, dried scallops account for over 97% of all imports, and abalone accounts for over 70%. Moreover, these abalone, dried scallops, sea cucumbers, and other items are mostly luxury goods, and their purchase elasticity is very strong. If the tax rate is low and the price is cheap, sales will be smooth, and the import of Japanese products will inevitably be high.</p>
<p>Theoretically, China should and can freely increase tariffs. For example, the Tariff Autonomy Act passed in 1925 specifies in the first item of the Tariff Rate Regulations:</p>
<p>"When foreign goods are transported to trading ports in this country, import duties shall be levied in accordance with the taxation methods stipulated in these regulations."</p>
<p>This means that any foreign goods imported should have the obligation to comply with the "taxation methods stipulated" in the Tariff Rate Regulations. Furthermore, in order to protect domestic businesses, the Tariff Rate Regulations also allow for temporary increases in tariffs on foreign goods and stipulate three items: (1) retaliatory tariffs, (2) countervailing tariffs, and (3) anti-dumping tariffs. Currently, Japanese aquatic products are being dumped at reduced prices. Let's look at the provisions of this third item (Article 8 of the original regulations states):</p>
<p>"If foreign goods are intentionally depreciated in price and the government believes that there is a risk of disturbing the market, it may order, in addition to the tax amount listed in the tariff schedule, a tax equivalent to its fair price."</p>
<p>Accordingly, China has the inalienable right to impose appropriate increased taxes on foreign goods that harm our businesses. In the Industrial and Commercial Conference of the 19th year of the Republic (1930), the conditions for preventing dumping through anti-dumping duties were also passed, indicating that the central government had the motivation to implement them early on. Recently, there has been a design for state-operated trade. Then, how can the legitimate initial step of increasing taxes be put aside?</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are numerous precedents for anti-dumping regulations in various countries. For example, Canada repeatedly revised its anti-dumping duties in 1904 and 1907. New Zealand, a small country, also had the Agricultural Implements Manufacturing Import and Implementation Act in 1905. Australia also had two anti-dumping duties. The successive revisions of tariffs in the United States have focused on preventing the dumping of foreign goods. Recently, Germany, France, and many small countries in Central Europe have used tariff protection policies to protect domestic industries from foreign pressure.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is common for countries to impose special tariffs on certain goods. Taking aquatic products as an example, France, in order to protect its domestic sprat fishing industry, used high-pressure tactics against American-made tomato sprats and levied a special aquatic canned food import tax, starting in 1931. For each box of American and Russian goods, the tax was about 16 national currency units, while Canadian goods were taxed at 8 units, and Japanese goods were taxed at only 4 units. Furthermore, Germany considered Japanese canned crab to be a luxury item and levied a special tariff of 18 units per box. Since President Roosevelt took office in the United States, in order to protect domestic aquatic businesses and prevent the dumping of foreign goods, he suddenly announced a protection plan on December 15, 1933. The import taxes on aquatic products were largely increased, and it was stipulated that they would take effect on January 13, 1934. For example, canned tuna imported from foreign countries was subject to a tax of 30% to 45% ad valorem, and oil-soaked sprats priced at less than 9 cents per pound were subject to a tax of 30% to 44% ad valorem. The tax on Japanese-imported bivalve cans was increased to 52% ad valorem from May 31st. Furthermore, New York in the United States, due to the large number of Japanese oyster seedlings being imported (9,000 boxes were shipped in March of the 22nd year (1933), and another 3,000 boxes were shipped in April, showing the large total), specifically prohibited the import of Japanese oyster seedlings from the Pacific coast for transplantation to the Atlantic coast. At the same time, various states on the Pacific coast also followed suit, with a tendency to prohibit imports on the Pacific coast. All of this fully expresses that "any imported aquatic products that harm the domestic fishing industry must have their tariffs increased or be prohibited from import altogether."</p>
<p>If we do not want our aquatic business to sit idly by and wait for death, then we must burn our boats and exhaust every method to "do it"! The best way to "do it" is to implement a quota system for imports under a controlled economy. The import quota system is an important part of modern countries' tariff policies. As a protective tariff policy, this system directly and appropriately restricts the quantity of imports. The method of this system is to determine the total amount of foreign imports by referring to domestic consumption and domestic production, so as not to affect the surplus or deficiency of demand and supply. Furthermore, the implementation of this system does not require special legislation or other legal procedures and is mostly implemented by emergency orders. Currently, our country's tariffs seem to lack absolute freedom due to the constraints of tariff treaties. Like France, which has 72% of its tariffs regulated by commercial treaties, it has often or recently used import quota systems.</p>
<p>The characteristic of the import quota system is that it can adopt equal or proportional quotas for various foreign countries in terms of imports, which is called "external quotas." Currently, Japanese aquatic products are being dumped to such an extent that they are harming our country's fishing industry. We can grant a small amount of import permits or make the quantity equal to the import permits of various countries, so that they cannot manipulate the market. At a minimum, we can know the exact amount and actual price of imports in advance and obtain a control function.</p>
<p>The import quota system should also determine the respective import quantities of domestic importers, which is called "internal quotas." Currently, most of our country's importers import goods blindly, and they especially like to import Japanese goods in order to seek easy profits. Furthermore, they go a step further and repackage the imported Japanese goods in order to sell them off as soon as possible, which promotes the dumping power of Japanese products. The author has always advocated trade control, so this initial control of traders is a point that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>The import quota system should further determine the import quantity for each month from the total import quantity and should pay more attention to the state of production in domestic industries to stipulate the quantity of certain goods imported in certain months, which is called seasonal quotas. For example, in France, during the one-year period from July 1931 to July 1932, the quantity of general fish prices in October, salted and dried fish in December, and canned fish in February was stipulated, because this is the period of French aquatic production, thereby protecting the industry. As for our country, during the fishing season—such as when large yellow croaker, small yellow croaker, and ribbonfish are abundant in Jiangsu and Zhejiang—most of the production is transported to Shanghai, reaching about 10,000 dan per day, which immediately shows a surplus in the market. Coupled with inconvenient transportation, it is impossible to quickly transport fresh fish out, resulting in low fish prices and suffering for fishermen. However, Japanese fish prices take advantage of this period to intentionally cut prices and dump them, causing chaos in fish prices and the complete collapse of the fishing economy. This period is when a "seasonal tariff" should be implemented. Now, if there is a "seasonal quota" with import restrictions in advance, it will naturally protect domestic industries from foreign pressure.</p>
<p>At this point, we can believe that the import quota system can—and should—be implemented to prevent the dumping of Japanese aquatic products. However, before we implement it, we should have sufficient research. First, we must understand the specific content of the import quota system. Second, we must observe the status of the domestic aquatic economy. Third, we must analyze imported aquatic products! Of course, we should pay special attention to the import status of Japanese products and the domestic production status. Finally, we should grasp the current state of the national economy and the trends of the international economic community.</p>
<p>In addition, the most important preparatory work is to investigate the actual situation of aquatic trade and, more importantly, to obtain accurate import and export statistics. Recently, the National Economic Committee has established an investigation office in Shanghai. The important work has stipulated an item for import and export investigation. We hope that it will pay more attention to aquatic products and have detailed plans. This article cannot discuss it much, but it only hopes that the relevant parties will pay attention to preparing for implementation!</p>

<h3 id="e47">Finance: The Foreign Exchange Market is Firm, While Fractional Currency Slightly Rises <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and although several banks remained open as usual, their number was small. Consequently, remittance transactions were completely at a standstill. As the holidays draw near, social needs have not diminished, so market sentiment remains exceptionally firm, not declining due to the bank closures. Yesterday's morning and afternoon foreign exchange rates remained at 13 cents, the same as the previous day. Trading in drafts also remained steady. The total morning transaction volume was over 3.5 million, and the afternoon volume was over 400,000, with over 200,000 transacted at the small exchange. Money shops saw foreign public bill remittances exceeding 3.1 million, gang-related funds exceeding 600,000, foreign pledge transactions with over 600,000 in redemptions, and over 800,000 in new transactions. The market for fractional currency also saw a slight increase compared to the previous day. Jiangnan small silver coins, while unchanged in the morning at 834 yuan, rose to 835 yuan in the afternoon, an increase of one yuan from the previous day, with 3,000 coins traded in the morning and 6,000 in the afternoon. Guangdong small silver coins briefly fell by 5 jiao in the morning, trading at 747 yuan and 5 jiao, but rose by 7 jiao in the afternoon to 748 yuan and 2 jiao. As a result, the outcome was 2 jiao better than the previous day, with 105,000 coins traded in the morning and 45,000 in the afternoon. Copper coins were at 321,000 cash, a decrease of 2,000 cash from the previous day, with a transaction price of 8,600 yuan, equivalent to 27,606 strings of cash.</p>

<p>Bond Market Still Watching Large Investors' Attitude</p>
<p>Weekly Turnover About 12 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Last week, from September 10th to 15th, the Huashang Securities Exchange experienced significant and rapid price fluctuations. After a period of hovering, rumors, both positive and negative, suddenly arose. Coupled with the substantial transaction volume, exceeding 60 million yuan, one point of particular interest was whether a certain bull operator had emerged and whether a large amount of pledged funds had been secured by banks or would be released into the market. The foreign exchange rate hovered between 10 cents and 13 cents, with no significant deviation from the market price. While some bulls and bears had already hedged outside the market, many of the determined bears remained unmoved, believing the market would decline. Any opportunity could still lead to significant fluctuations. Observing the current environment, the future trend will likely be characterized by fluctuating prices due to the changing relationship between supply and demand for chips. As only six days remain in the current month, both bulls and bears have floating profits to hedge. Last week, on Monday, rumors of a certain telegram caused prices to fall by several jiao to 1.2 yuan. On Tuesday, the market situation was uncertain, with uneven price movements and inconsistent results. On Wednesday, the foreign exchange rate was higher, and Northern traders sold considerably. Although the number four position showed some buying interest, selling pressure prevailed, with prices falling by about half a yuan. On Thursday, hedging transactions surged, and prices fluctuated, rising and falling differently by about 30 to 40 jiao. On Friday, rumors spread that a large amount of pledged funds had been secured, significantly reducing the number of chips in the market. Bears immediately began to cover their positions, and the bullish trend was strong, with positions 21, 38, and 78 showing strong buying interest, surging by several jiao to a range of two yuan. On Saturday morning, prices fluctuated during both trading sessions, weakening slightly in the afternoon, retracing about one yuan. As a result of the week's market prices, there was a slight increase of a few jiao to over one yuan. The total transaction volume was 11,964,000 yuan. A comparative table of the high, low, and increase/decrease results is listed below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>U.S. Cotton Lacks Major Buyers</p>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton weakened due to a lack of major buyers, selling by Southern traders, and profit-taking by bulls. As a result, spot prices fell by 10 points, and futures prices fell by 1 to 9 points. British cotton futures fell by 2 to 3 points. Indian cotton initially strengthened due to short covering and purchases by European exporters, but later retreated due to profit-taking by bulls. As a result, Ping Ge'er and Bai Luo Xi fell by 1.5 rupees, and Aomu La fell by 1.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated the 15th):</p>

<p>River Rice is Stable with a Hint of Softness</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Sources from various groups have become slightly scarce, accounting for only the 11th and 12th (a total of 1,700 to 1,800 shi). Sales are still sluggish, and market sentiment remains flat. Transactions for various types of rice remain limited. Fortunately, incoming goods are not strong, and the market is relatively stable. Therefore, the prices of various thick japonica and late-season rice have not fluctuated much, only showing a slight sign of softness. Special japonica rice and new Yangchuan Jian rice have seen a sharp drop of 20 to 30 cents due to the weather turning sunny and weakening market sentiment. However, new Lu rice is quite popular with customers and has been able to hold its ground relatively well. The supply of Yuan rice is short, and there is no change.</p>

<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 27th and 28th arrivals from various routes downriver, with the market absorbing various goods. Although the weather has turned sunny, arrivals downriver are becoming increasingly abundant, and new goods from inland areas are gradually entering the market. Market sentiment is trending downward, with few listings from Xiangfang, resulting in sluggish retail sales. Market prices for white japonica are slightly lower by 10 cents, while medium-grade and new Yangjian Tuanjian are down by 10 to 20 cents. Thin rice, old Yangjian, and new Chen Kejian are also down by about 10 cents. Dongxin japonica rice is balanced in supply and demand, with stable prices. White Yuan rice is similar to previous levels.</p>

<p>Sugar Market: Chaoqing Shantou Inventory Low</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw continued tightness in 24 coarse white sugar. The association's clearing price for spot ordinary sugar remained unchanged, but the price for goods from this shop rose by 5 yuan, clearing at 19 yuan 8 jiao and 5 fen, with a few transactions. Transshipment goods were priced at 6 yuan and 5 jiao and 5 fen, and Dutch sugar was also priced at 14 yuan and 2 jiao, but the transshipment goods were not cleared. Both Zhenji and Zhenyu cotton white sugar from this factory were priced at the original clearing price, but there was a lack of buyers, indicating that it would be difficult to maintain a stable price in the future. The domestic Chaoqing from Shantou saw prices decline in both Shantou and Shanghai due to the Mid-Autumn Festival. However, after investigating, the inventory in Shantou is very low, with only 2,000 to 3,000 bags in total. It is possible that prices may rebound after the festival. The current sales period is still long, and new futures contracts are not expected for more than three months. It is anticipated that the existing inventory will not be able to meet the new demand, and the long-term outlook is not expected to be too sluggish.</p>

<p>Electroplated Spectacle Frames Sell Well</p>
<p>The various types of Shuangsui brand electroplated spectacle frames newly invented by the Sida Company have recently become popular in the local market, with considerable sales. Yesterday, the Sichuan gang saw further activity. It was found that over 400 boxes were traded (one dozen per box), with prices such as 16 yuan 5 jiao per dozen for 10-inch antique silver shields, 18 yuan for 10-inch silver shields, 14 yuan for 7-inch dragon and phoenix antique colors, 15 yuan for 7-inch dragon and phoenix silver shields, 13 yuan 5 jiao for 7-inch silver shield antique colors, and 14 yuan 5 jiao for 7-inch silver shield silver colors.</p>

<h3 id="e48">Starting from Professional Jealousy <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Xin</p>
<p>The matter of professional jealousy, to use a term from the national essence salvation theory, "has existed since ancient times." I remember when I was young, I often heard the saying "competitors are like enemies." And our "businessmen's" forte is nothing more than imitation, counterfeiting, and copying. In this day and age when selfishness is increasingly declining, the reality of professional jealousy will naturally play out more prominently.</p>
<p>I don't know who the clever person was who came up with the method of "professional consensus," trying to use the power of this "professional consensus" to flatten market prices. On the surface, market prices naturally become flat due to discussion, but in reality, it's not like that at all. For example, in silk shops, although the selling price can be the same, the additional markup is at the discretion of the seller. After a long time, the agreed-upon prices become merely a formality.</p>
<p>Someone will definitely blame you for not "agreeing upon" the markup as well. This sounds easy, but in reality, there are still many difficulties. To accommodate customers, the hand naturally loosens a bit. Even if we take a step back and say that everyone is willing to unify without exception, there are still differences in the busyness of the location, the quietness, and the size of the expenses. And the Chinese have a strange temper, stubbornly believing that the older the brand, the better. This can perhaps be refuted with other reasons, but the biggest fatal blow is that if the goods are left for too long, they either spoil or go out of fashion. Taking silk as an example, what used to be three or four yuan per foot for various colorful satins is now worth less than thirty or forty cents per bolt, and no one cares.</p>
<p>Seeing that "procrastination breeds problems," they come up with "professional consensus" again. However, this system that has been negated by objective circumstances has a shorter and shorter "consensus" power each time.</p>
<p>Then, some people rely on strong capital to implement a trust policy. According to the common law of the survival of the fittest, the trust policy naturally has a temporary effect. As a result, the chimneys of nearby factories gradually increase, and handicraftsmen have to abandon their crude tools at home and go to the coal ash conveyor belts to earn a bowl of rice.</p>
<p>However, just as the power of machinery is driving out handicrafts, foreign capital is relying on the various advantages of advanced countries to defeat it. On the one hand, because this change is too fast, and coupled with the various contradictions of capitalism, the Chinese market becomes even more chaotic.</p>
<p>In this chaotic situation, handicraftsmen, on the one hand, have to abandon their crude tools at home, and on the other hand, because the immature industry is killed by foreign capital, they deeply feel that there is no work to do. What's more, they have encountered the raging waves of the world's economic recession, and China has helplessly become the end of the world's dumping ground.</p>
<p>Second- and third-rate shops, under this layer of pressure, cannot resist this irresistible force. To allow it to be swallowed up is naturally unwilling. Before they can clearly identify the target, they spray the poisonous gas of "small profits, high turnover" on their bodies.</p>
<p>But even if they defeat the enemy they currently regard as the enemy, what then? The answer is still not optimistic. Even if we take a step back and say that everyone is putting up the banner of "small profits, high turnover," then the answer is still not optimistic.</p>
<p>If you don't believe it, please look at the facts to prove it later.</p>

<h3 id="e49">One Side of the City <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Yun</p>
<p>At 10:30, I came out of the Xinya Restaurant on Nanjing Road. There was no moon in the sky, but there were stars like chess pieces. A few people were a little drunk and dragged their heavy steps.</p>
<p>Although the three major companies and other major stores had closed their doors long ago, another kind of business was actively taking its place. Reflected under the red and bright neon lights of the large glass windows, we could clearly see rows of young women with slicked hair and painted faces standing there, forcing a smile for life, selling their bodies and souls.</p>
<p>——Come on, go to the room to play, come on——</p>
<p>The voice is so touching, melodious, gentle, like a nightingale.</p>
<p>Sending out a charming look, displaying the alluring magic possessed by fox-like women: cotton-like hands, snow-lotus-like arms wrapped around my waist, hugging, pretending to be a very intimate, clinging expression.</p>
<p>Suddenly receiving this unexpected stimulus, I was a little embarrassed, my heart was pounding like a pendulum, and my face was burning a little.</p>
<p>——Haha, Alon, are you carrying good luck today? She's hitting on you...</p>
<p>My friends were laughing, bending over and laughing.</p>
<p>Walking to the intersection of Nanjing Road, the pedestrians and cars were still so crowded. The wind poured down from the top of the large buildings, fresh and cool, blowing away the irritability on my body. At this time, the drunkenness had completely disappeared. Listening to the "toot-toot" whistles of the small steamboats coming and going in the Huangpu River, a few people stood there blankly, a little lost.</p>
<p>Looking at the stars in the sky and the clock tower of the Jianghai Customs, we were speechless and in a daze.</p>
<p>——Where do we go after all?</p>
<p>At this time, everyone's heart seemed to be awakened by the evening breeze, and they realized that they were walking.</p>
<p>——Let's rent a steamboat to take a ride in the center of the river.</p>
<p>——It's better to sit in the Bund Park.</p>
<p>The destination was finally decided, and a few people walked into the gate of the Bund Park one after another.</p>
<p>Although I have been in Shanghai for many years, tonight is my first time entering the Bund Park. What impressed me was that there were so many people, more than any other park. Everywhere you could smell the meaty smell that was both sour and seemed to carry a bit of floral fragrance; and there were many fashionable girls shuttling back and forth like butterflies, displaying her magic to attract the guests in the park.</p>
<p>(A gathering place for sex maniacs, a chasing field; it devours the youth and ambition of young people, and then even throws the shell into the river, letting it flow eastward with the rolling tide.)</p>
<p>It was gradually going away, and the long and short hands of the Jianghai Customs clock had come together and pointed at twelve o'clock. The iron railings along the river had been moistened with a layer of cool dew, and the tourists were also blown very cool and felt a little tired and went home to sleep. However, some pitiful people who could not get customers had to lower their prices to solicit customers for life, struggling desperately in the darkness.</p>
<p>(In fact, looking at it from the outside of the city, it seems so sacred and brilliant; but looking at its dark side, its filth and sin, it will smear the sacredness and brilliance beyond recognition!)</p>
<h3 id="e50">Blood and Sweat <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>This is a fact that I can never forget.</p>
<p>It was the day before I left my hometown, and I happened to think of my kind old uncle, so I decided to go to my uncle's place, partly to relieve boredom and partly to say goodbye.</p>
<p>My uncle was sitting there glumly, picking up his pipe and loading it with tobacco. After I greeted him, I told him that I would be leaving for Shanghai tomorrow.</p>
<p>Suddenly he looked at me in surprise:</p>
<p>"Are you still going to university?"</p>
<p>"Yes." I answered nonchalantly.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, my uncle shook his head, and from his old and weak eyes, which were failing, were shooting rays of extreme doubt. He put aside his pipe and said to me, "Your university probably costs three or four hundred yuan a year. Oh, this three or four hundred yuan, in our countryside..." My uncle stopped there, sighed deeply, and then continued, "In these years, the price of rice is so cheap, less than six yuan a stone, right? Alas, this three or four hundred yuan, isn't it necessary to exchange six or seventy stones of grain for it?" My uncle deliberately raised his voice. "XX, you must know that these six or seventy stones of grain need the blood and sweat of people, young and old? Let's say that one mu of land can harvest two stones of grain (that's only referring to a good year), then isn't it necessary to harvest from more than thirty mu of land to get six or seventy stones? Alas, how much blood and sweat does it take to irrigate more than thirty mu of land!"</p>
<p>My uncle's words, one sound after another, were piercing my heart like a drill. Yes. Drop by drop of blood and sweat, working tirelessly year after year, the families on more than thirty mu of land, selling all their grain, can only barely provide for the expenses of one university student. I was so moved that I sat there motionless. I had no words to respond. I felt deeply ashamed. Did I have such a right? Could I be so callous? Alas! I alone was absorbing such an immeasurable amount of other people's blood and sweat. At the same time, a shocking tragedy floated before my eyes: I seemed to see batches of cash, transformed from the blood and sweat of the countryside, being brought into the city by many young men and women, who completely forgot that this silver was inlaid with the blood and sweat of farmers, and handed it over one by one to the bosses of theaters, the bosses of dance halls... My head was dizzy, and my eyes seemed to be filled with piles of blood, stones of grain. "Uncle, goodbye." I couldn't sit there any longer.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Talking About the Mouth <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Bin</p>
<p>The mouth is the tool for eating, and also the tool for talking. Because it can eat and talk, we are turned upside down and rushing around between this in and out, and it has to talk about itself.</p>
<p>Because the words it speaks are humble, it is inevitably scolded for flattering; the words it speaks are arrogant, and it is even more inevitably scolded for boasting; the words it speaks are harsh, and it will be resented; the words it speaks are soft, and it will be said to be useless. If it's too straightforward, it will offend people; if it's too cunning, it will be deceiving. If it's too honest, it will be fooled; if it's too hypocritical, it will lose credibility. If it doesn't talk when it should talk, it's called not being able to talk; if it talks when it shouldn't, it will be rebuffed. We are left with this not good, that not good, it is really hateful.</p>
<p>Furthermore, talking about its eating is even more endless. Three meals a day, eating today, eating tomorrow, eating the day after tomorrow, never resting (except when there is a reason to rest). One day, but I have never seen it full. Moreover, in this era when there are more monks than congee, rice is the most difficult to get. You must have the ability to find food. Otherwise, when people cook fragrant white rice and delicious delicacies, we can only swallow our saliva towards our stomachs, watching it not being able to eat. Even if we are lucky and find a rice bowl, damn it, there is no meal provided, and we still have to bother ourselves to find food. Especially, when it comes to flavorful foods, it is not polite at all, it just chews; tasteless, or foods with a slightly unpleasant taste, hand it to it, sorry, it will immediately be unhappy, and even frown. Don't you think it is the number one villain in the world?</p>
<p>From this point of view, it treats us people as slaves, like Tang Seng, who put the golden ring on Sun Wukong's head, so that we can't get rid of it.</p>

<h3 id="e52">Gao Fushou <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— Village Cause</p>
<p>Gao Fushou always came home drunk and boisterous.</p>
<p>His face, his eyes… like a beaten-down, dying lion! He seemed to have boundless grievances, as if he wanted to roar out from his chest, but something always suppressed it.</p>
<p>He often said to people:</p>
<p>— Drinking can help me avoid being entangled by many hideous faces!</p>
<p>His words were a bit incomprehensible! Because an executioner wouldn't be afraid of anything!</p>
<p>— Old Gao! You're used to killing people. Are you afraid of these things?</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Gao Fushou was stunned, and said painfully and heavily:</p>
<p>— Sir! You don't understand. I believe: there isn't anyone in the world who truly wants to do the job of killing!</p>
<p>— Old Gao! Then why do you do this job of killing?</p>
<p>— Ah! Sir. Who doesn't want to quit this profession! But if I quit, where will I find food to feed my family of five?</p>
<p>His eyeballs were filled with red veins! His hairy hand kept clenching. He said.</p>
<p>— How many people have you killed?</p>
<p>This question made him even more uneasy! Slowly, he said reluctantly:</p>
<p>— Sir! In total, I have killed…</p>
<p>He paused, his eyes fixed, calculating. Then he continued:</p>
<p>— In total, I have killed more than thirty people! Some were hanged, some were beheaded, some were shot! … Hmm. Sir! You don't know about those who were hanged! … They… If I think about it carefully! I simply don't want to see this world anymore! This world… Sir! Goodbye!</p>
<p>With that, he grabbed his head and ran away like a madman!</p>
<p>On the street, the others who saw him in this state laughed. One of them said to me:</p>
<p>— He is not a sinner!</p>
<p>— No, he is doing good deeds for his children! Because all the people he killed were bad people…</p>
<p>These words, one by one, were transmitted into my ears.</p>
<p>About five months later, rumors spread on the street:</p>
<p>! Gao Fushou is dead!</p>
<p>! It's right that an executioner should die like this!</p>
<p>! Hmm. I heard that he went crazy and gouged out his own eyes! Then he bit off all ten of his fingers! Shouting madly: "I don't want to see this world anymore! I don't want to use these hands to do this anymore!"</p>
<p>! How did he die later?</p>
<p>! Later, later he died in pain!</p>
<p>Five days after his death, I ran into his wife.</p>
<p>— Sir! Please give me some help!</p>
<p>At first, I didn't recognize her as Gao Fushou's wife, but then she said herself:</p>
<p>— Sir! Please have pity on me! My husband recently went mad and died! Leaving behind, there is an old mother, and three young children… According to the officials in the yamen, I should be able to get twenty dollars in compensation! But I only got five dollars… To this day, I still can't afford to bury him! I have no money! Sir. Ah! He already smells… Please have some compassion…</p>
<p>Hearing her words, I reached into my pocket to find money. Heavens! I only had one round silver dollar! I gave it all to her! In this way, I went hungry for three days!</p>
<p>Look: The bleak snow, buries many</p>
<p>Gao Fushou's death, almost everywhere is wearing white mourning clothes! However, once the sun comes out, these will turn into water!…</p>
<h3 id="e53">The Whip of Life <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>The accumulation of days cruelly plundered everything, pushing me from childhood into the hell of adulthood, so I had to start chewing on the bitter plans of life. I have a young body and an old heart. Everything in front of me is covered with a layer of grayness, not a bit of excitement arises in me, but only fatigue, boundless fatigue and boundless sorrow.</p>
<p>"What else do I hope for?" Facing the cold, ruthless face of life presented before me, I often asked myself with a touch of hysteria. Yes, who says the upper side of life is painted with blue color, a picture of longing. These beautiful lines have never floated in my mind, nor have I ever planted the idea of fantasy in it. I only know that life to me is simply a failing leather whip, flogging my back every day. I have simply become a camel, become a cart, carrying stones and coal weighing a thousand pounds, driven by the whip of life, gasping for breath, sweating, walking on the confusing, endless, dark night road, there is no moon in the sky, nor houses, no thick shadows surround me, I will forever be in the trembling shadows, carrying heavy burdens and crawling forward.</p>
<p>In this way, I gradually became thin, so thin that only an empty shell of skin and bones remained. And the whip of life still does not let up on grinding me. I wanted to rest for a moment, but it always shouted at me to hurry on the road, I had nothing to say, I could only grit my teeth and listen to it continue to ravage me; in this way, I almost lost even my senses, do I still believe that I am a person with a soul! I am almost the same as a soulless yin corpse!</p>
<p>The dust swept up by the road of life, layer upon layer, pressed down on my thoughts. Buried my eyes, I can't see everything, I only see the vastness of the sea, the melancholy sky. Besides being the cattle and horses of life, suffering every day, what else have I gained! I often open my eyes in the sleepless late night, grab my own hair; desperately beat my chest, even forget the pain and hit the wall with my hands, constantly shouting, "What can life give me after all," but life doesn't pay attention to me, its mouth always hangs with a vicious sneer, and when tomorrow comes, life comes again to force me, pulling me to squeeze into that big millstone to grind and break, so I endure the pain and struggle, and struggle day by day, ah! My autumn leaf-like body, I really can't support it anymore, I am ready to use the last of my remaining life to fight life to the death, but I don't have a shred of strength, I can only watch the demon of life devour my flesh in one mouthful ah! …</p>
<h3 id="e54">Nicknames <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— Ryunosuke Akutagawa, translated by Wakagi</p>
<p>Nicknames, like works of art, can reveal a person's personality. Like Hishida Shunso, in his youth he was called "Swift Runner". So Shunso in his youth was probably very "swift". If that's not wrong, then Masamune Hakucho should have been called Shirotsuka in his youth. -- Whether he was called Shirotsuka, perhaps my memory is wrong, but, assuming it's not wrong, then from this nickname, it is enough to infer Masamune Hakucho in his youth. Therefore, I think that ancient literati shouldered many nicknames, not treating nicknames like amusing toys, but adapting to the progress of their interests. (Chengjiangtang Miscellany)</p>
<p>Self-Cultivation</p>
<p>Conscience is a kind of serious taste.</p>
<p>Conscience may have created morality, but morality has not created the "good" character of conscience.</p>
<p>Conscience is like taste, it has a morbidly compassionate component. However, among those who are morbidly compassionate, eight or nine out of ten are smart, aristocratic, and wealthy, these kinds of people. (Dwarf's Words)</p>
<p>Busy</p>
<p>What can rescue us from the poisonous thickets of love: busyness is even more powerful than reason. To practice love, time is more important than anything. Like Werther, Romeo, Tolstoy, etc., who are called ancient saints of love, they are all idle people. (Ibid.)</p>
<p>Men</p>
<p>From ancient times, men have always regarded their careers as more important and more respectable than love. If you doubt that this is not the truth, then please read Balzac's letters. Balzac wrote to Mrs. Hanska, "This letter, if put up for auction, will get a lot of francs in royalties." (Ibid.)</p>
<p>Confession</p>
<p>The ancients confessed before God; people today confess before society. Because no matter who, no matter what it is -- except for fools, and evildoers are exceptions -- if they don't confess, they may feel very painful at present.</p>
<p>Also</p>
<p>Although no matter how they confess, whether they can gain that kind of trust is their own business, and at the same time it becomes another question. (Ibid.)</p>
