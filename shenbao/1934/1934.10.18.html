<p>— 恒</p>
<p>丨法國今後之外交丨</p>
<p>自今夏以來。歐洲大陸諸國。不僅多事。且其政治要人之去世者。亦較往常爲多。其中如興登堡以天年終。陶爾斐斯。亞歷山大。巴爾都。則皆死於暗殺。世人於此數人之死。已爲驚愕不置。深恐國際局勢。因以劇變。不謂歐電傳來。法國老政治家普恩萊又告逝世。能不益增世人之悲感而身爲歐局重心之法國。於一週之内。迭喪二大政治要人。尤不能不令人悼愭不已也。</p>
<p>普恩萊身爲法國總統。歷時七載。（一九一二丨二○年）然其知名於世。不若其身爲總理之時。尤不若其身兼外長之時。蓋法國總統爲榮譽職。實際上政治衝要。悉由總理當之。故一經當選爲總統之後。其名往往不能日見於報章。如今之杜邁格。亦曾爲總統。（一九二○丨二七年）。然知者甚少。今爲總理。而知者反多。蓋一操實權。一擁虚位故耳。然總理之名。有時又遠不如外長之炫赫。蓋值此國際多事之秋。苟其外長而有天才。無不能以高人之手腕。建立不世之奇勳。内以受國人之贊美。外以受列邦之推重。往日之白里安。近頃之巴爾都。皆曾屢爲總理。然其著名於世。則皆在其身任外長之時。事實顯然。至普恩萊之著名。亦在於以總理而兼任外長。殊不在其身爲法國總統也。</p>
<p>法自大戰以還。外交上政績震鑠一時者。計有三人。一卽普恩萊。二爲白里安。三爲巴爾都。普恩萊之外交。卽在對德絕不假借。和約必須履行。賠欵必須償付。雖以當時英國之不能恊作。應付困難。然仍不惜以武力壓迫德國。出兵佔領魯爾。他如萊因撤兵之延不履行。賠欵數額之不肯核减。皆其對德政策之著者也。故普恩萊之外交。實法國外交最强硬之典型也。至於白里安之外交。舉世皆知其爲恊和外交。如洛加諾條約之訂立。德國之加入國聯。非戰公約之成立。德國賠欵之核减。皆其外交成績之犖犖大者。至最近之巴爾都。實爲一縱横捭闔之外交家。其目的即在多聯與國。以孤德勢。如加緊小恊約之同盟。促進巴爾幹之團結。造成法俄之携手。消釋英法之猜嫌。袪除法意之疑忌。胥其成功之大者。此種外交。謂之集團外交。縱横外交。均無不可。然此三人之外交方式雖似各異。然其主旨。則無不相同。如普氏之意。在防止德國復起以爲患於法。白里安之主旨。則在謀祛德人之仇怨。使之復成好友。以謀兩國之諒解。而巴爾都之意。在多樹友邦。以减德助。故一言以蔽之。三人之用心。皆在爲法國謀安全。特其方式微有不同耳。</p>
<p>今巴爾都已矣。其外長一席。已由賴伐爾繼任。普恩萊已矣。其人亦祗留法國政治史上之想像。今後法國之外交。將一仍舊貫耶。抑將另闢蹊徑耶。實爲值得注意之問題。唯就十餘年來之法國外交。作一總觀察。其根本要點總在於安全。而共方式。亦不外此强硬恊和與縱横捭闔之三途。且法國外交政策。各黨大同小異。故歷來政潮。癓結皆在内政。鮮有因外交而發生政潮者。而在國步艱難之時。外交之方針。尤必確定不易。故人物之更易。决無多大影響。有之。亦僅在手腕之差别而不在其他。此則吾人可以懸想而得者也。</p>

<p>西安十六日電、蔣委員長十五日在各界擴大紀念週訓話、題爲「陜遊之感想與對於陜西之希望」、原詞如次、</p>
<p>邵主席·楊主任·各位同志、今天兄弟到了西安來參加擴大紀念週、實在是很難得的機會、因此感覺非常快樂、非常光榮、現在想藉此機會、將個人到了陜西以後的感想、和對於我們陜西各界同志同胞的希望、和大家說一說、大家都知道的陜西省尤其是長安、這個地方、是我們中國文化之發源地、亦可以說是我們中華民族的發祥地、自黄帝開國以後、從周代起歷秦漢唐諸朝、都是以長安爲中國的首都、而且在這個時代、我們中華民族、無論武功文化、都由此不斷的發揚光大到極盛的地步、所以不僅是生長在這個地方的人、要認識這種民族歷史的光榮和偉大、而毅然以復興民族之大業、引爲己任、就是從遠方來遊的人員、要他是中華民國的國民、是黄帝的子孫、中華民族的一份子、莫不懷古情深、油然感奮、看到如此美好的河山和歷代許多的遺跡、想起歷代祖先建設國家發展民族的偉蹟、就可以曉得我們中華民族有最偉大的創造能力、和最光明的文明歷史、同時再想起現在我們國家危急存亡的情形、更是不勝今昔之感、你看我們的祖先是何等的偉大、我們的歷史是何等的光榮、但是到了現在、内憂外患、紛至沓來、國家已陷於危險存亡的境地、不僅不足與各國並駕齊驅、而獨立生存於世界、並且連第三等的國家地位也做不到、而且要列在次殖民地的地位、隨時有被滅亡的危險、這是何等的恥辱、何等悲的痛、但是我們大家都是黄帝以來歷代聖祖神宗的後裔、祖先旣有那樣偉大的聰明智力、那樣偉大的精神氣魄、那樣偉大的事業、難道我們就没有嗎、難道我們就不能繼承祖先光榮的歷史和偉大的事業嗎、祖先偉大的聰明智力氣魄精神當然都遺傳給我們了、我們相信我們的聰明智力氣魄精神、一定不會比古人差多少、應當能够繼往開來、做出一番偉大的事業、然而何以現在我們的民族、會如此衰弱、國家會如此危險呢、最大的一個根本原因就是由於一般國民、忘記了我們祖先的偉大和民族歷史的光榮、忘記了他自己民族固有最偉大的智能·最高尙的德性最優秀的文化·和最寳貴的精神、甚至連祖先所遺下偉大的基業、如此雄壯的河山、也忘記了、因此喪失了國家和民族固有的靈魂、不能自重自信、不能奮發有爲、馴至國家民族的地位、日益衰落危亡、而一般國民、尙不知覺悟奮發、自强自救、以負起救亡復興之大任、大家要曉得一個人全靠有精神有靈魂、如果失了靈魂·没有精</p>
<p>神、這個人一定不能生存、就是暫時苟存、也如同死了一樣、即所謂行屍走肉、屍居餘氣、個人如此、國家和民族亦復如此、如果一個國家喪失了他的靈魂、没有精神、也一定要滅亡、不能繼續苟存的、現在我們國家和民族所以如此危急衰頽、也就是由於喪失了我們民族固有偉大的根本精神、和眞實的靈魂、因爲没有精神、失了靈魂、所以被人駡我們爲半死半活的國民、半死半活的國家和民族、我們國危民辱至於如此、試問何以對我們的祖先、還有何面目可以在世界上做人、何以見得我們國家和民族已經喪失了固有的靈魂呢、我們不必到其他各省去看、單就爲中國文化發原地的陜西的現狀來講、就可以證明剛才我已經講過陜西是我們中國文化的發源地、和中華民族的發祥地、自周公文武以下歷代、不知道有多少聖賢英傑挺生於此素稱文化禮義之邦、周公制禮作樂、使中國古代政敎文化燦然大備、也就是始於陜西、但是我們看現在的陜西、地猶是也、人猶是也、而過去的文物舊有的禮樂、却不見了、中華民族固有的美德、即總理在民族主義中所講的忠孝仁愛信義和平八</p>
<p>德以及中國數千年立國的根本精神、即管子所謂禮義廉恥四維、許多人也不免忽視了、如此我們國家民族、安得不危殆、管子說禮義廉恥國之四維、四維不張、國乃滅亡我們口誦心維、推今思昔、眞是不寒而慄、現在我們要挽救危亡、復興民族、應當從那裏着手呢、最重要的根本前提、就是首先要恢復我們國家和民族固有的靈魂、這個靈魂是什麽呢、就是剛才所已提到的忠孝仁愛信義和平八德、我們的祖先能够發揚這個八德、所以能建築如此偉大的民族和國家、現在因爲不講八德、失了靈魂、以至國危民辱、至於今日、所以要救亡復興、必須對症下藥、必要回復這個偉大的靈魂、要如何才可以達到這個目的呢、換句話說、要如何才可以恢復八德表現八德完成八德呢、這就要先實踐禮義廉恥四維尤其是要從禮字先做起、比方講、我們今天舉行紀念週、大家向黨國旗及總理遺像敬禮、這就是一種禮、由這個禮就可以表現我們是信仰總理效忠黨國、願意爲總理爲黨爲國而犧牲一切、有此誠敬之意、就可以完全恢復並充分發揚忠孝仁愛信義和平八德、而建設三民主義的新國家、復興我們文明俊秀的中華民族、以上是講我們今後救亡復興的根本途徑、在乎實踐四維、恢復八德、現在還有一點意思要補充的、就是實踐四維、應隨時隨地從日常生活做起、就是要使食衣住行、皆能合乎禮義廉恥、新生活運動的主旨、也就是在此、所以我們要實踐四維、恢復八德、以挽救危亡、復興民族、就要提倡新生活運動、照新生活的幾個標凖來改進、我們的生活純樸簡素、是我們陜西向來的遺風、大家都能普通做到、今後所最要注意的、就是竭力做到整齊清潔·迅速和確實·這四個標凖、而達到這四個標凖的基本條件、就是要勤勞、能勤勞才能整齊、能動勞才能清潔、亦必能勤勞然後能迅速確實、文王日昃不遑、周公夜以繼日、坐以待旦、就是我們祖先所留下來的最好的模範、古人當國家民族鼎盛之秋、尙且勤勞如此、我們現在當國族危亡千鈞一髮的時候、要圖存復興、當然非格外的勤勞不可、希望我們陜西各位同志、一定要習勤耐勞、力行新生活、並且要以身作則來提倡新生活、務使由己及人、由陜西一省而推至於全國、使全國的同胞、個個人都能力行新生活、實踐禮義廉恥、如此、我們陜西才可以擔負起復興民族的責任、不愧爲黄帝的子孫、總理的信徒、大家要記得陜西這個地方、是中華民族的發祥地、更是中國文化的發源地、而且陜西的人民、素稱好俠尙義、明禮知恥、自古以來、關中不知出了多少聖賢英傑、不但在歷史上代不乏人、就是最近仍舊遺風未墜、有很多革命先烈、爲國家爲民族爲革命而奮鬥犧牲、所以陜西無論在歷史上·地理上·文化上·政治上、都不可視爲一個普通的省、實爲國家民族最重要的基礎、所以我們陜西各界同志、居於如此非常的地方、格外要認識自己所處的地位、與其所負的責任之重大、格外要奮發努力來負起挽救危亡復興民族的使命、近幾年來、陜西無論在政治方面、軍事方面、經濟方面、以及學術文化方面、都有相當的進步、但是依現在的進度、仍舊不能達到預期的標凖、不足以担負復興民族的責任、今後希望大家要照我今天所講的意思注意四維八德、格外的發奮努力、以奠定革命的基礎、担負復興民族的責任、過去文王武王周公秦始皇漢武帝唐太宗、都是以陜西爲基礎、而建設偉大的國家、發揚民族的威德、古今中外罕與倫比、我們都是祖先的子孫、祖先偉大的智能、偉大的精神以及偉大的基業、都已遺傳給我們、只要我們自己能够認識清楚、能够發揮出來、我們個個人都可以做文武周公至於秦始皇漢武帝唐太宗等、其事業雖爲帝皇自私、不適於現代之今日、然而其爲發揚民族精神、增榮中華歷史的一種精神氣概、是我們後人應引爲自榮、而且人人應當具有此種復興民族的信心、而不可自己暴棄的、各位同志、尤其是一般青年、要知道現在中國的時代環境、實在是我們成大功立大業千載難逢的最好的機會、無論從歷史地理文化那一方面來講、種種的條件、都已經完備、尤其是當前的時代環境、更可以說是逼着我們來做復興民族的英雄豪傑、現在只要我們能發奮努力自强不息、一定可以達到復興民族的目的、完成我們所負的時代使命、兄弟此次到西安來、到處觸景生情、不禁發生無限的感想、同時對於我們陜西各界同志同胞、也抱有無窮希望、今天藉紀念週的機會、簡單的報告出來、我相信大家也一定有同樣的感想、一定能照我所希望於各位的發奮努力來盡到大家的責任、國家民族的前途、從此一定有無限的光明、（中央社）</p>

<p>▲課程中黨義材料一律不准採用</p>
<p>▲學校較前减少大部份青年失學</p>
<p>自九一八事變以還、我東北同胞在僞國傀儡政府壓迫之下、痛苦日深、而僞國文敎部施行奴化敎育、麻醉青年意志、昨上海社記者遇新自東北歸來之王君於寓次、談僞國施敎狀况如下、</p>
<p>（黨義材料不准採用）　據談、僞國文敎部施敎方針、名義上以注重王道、崇尙仁義爲標榜、命令各省學校將四書及孝經等、加入課程中、而實際上則背道而馳、文敎部並曾通令一凡是關於黨義的材料一律不准採用、當以反帝國論罪、」現各項敎科書正由奉天省敎育廳和南滿州敎育會着手編輯、再經過文敎部審定而後出版、其内容當可不言而知、</p>
<p>（學校减少青年失學）　東北學校現已减少、在九一八前遼寗省有一○三五○校、現僅六八八五校、吉林省有一二八六校、現僅四四九校、黑龍江省有六○○校、現僅四三二校、興安省有四四校、現僅三四校、東北特别區有一五二校、現僅一四三校、熱河有八七八校、現僅五校、故東北青年百分之九十五以上均遭失學、</p>
<p>（留日學生數額較多）　大部份學校均以日文爲必修科、廣設日語講習所、並獎勵留學日本、故近來僞國留日官費生有一○七人、自費生有一○九人、而留歐官費生僅一五人、自費生僅六人、各學校學費則已增加、初級小學九一八前每年七元、現增至每年三十二元、國立大學現尙未有、近有人建議將東北大學及吉林大學改爲國立、僞國並將文溯閣四庫全書、及東北大學與張學良之藏書蒐集整理、將張之私邸改爲國立圖書館、</p>
<p>（組少年團赴日參觀）　僞國對於體育方面、除去年與今年曾各舉行建國紀念運動會、次外、命令各校選撥</p>
<p>學生組織少年團、其組織類似童子軍、赴僞軍由日人加以指導訓練、並由各省選撥少年團赴日本參觀、其一舉一動、完全是傀儡行爲云、</p>

<p>▲市敎育局長潘公展在本市第三區敎育會會員大會演講</p>
<p>要使中小學敎育脫離已在消費分利的漩渦、改變爲生産工作的活動、自然要改革敎材課程等等而尤其重要的要有一般熱心奮鬥富有技能的師資、說到課程的支配、固然現在有部頒的課程標凖、但是這些課程標凖也未必完全適於實用、合乎理想、因爲這些起草和審訂課程標準的先生們、或者並不是研究編定課程的專家、而是某一學科的專家、某科的專家往往以爲自己所擅長敎授的一科最重要、因此對於本科的鐘點要求分配時間很多、這是人情之常、所以要改革課程的分配、不能單靠幾位起草和審訂課程的各科專家、乃要靠一般中小學裏熱心研究的敎員、他們對於敎育認爲是終身事業、認爲對於國家民族有很重大關係的事業、一面研究敎材的選擇、一面研究課程的分配、集思廣益、一定會有良好的改革方案可以擬訂出來、老實說、上海市的中心學敎員倘眞能熱心研究生産敎育實施時的課程敎材等等問題、一日有個很好的方案、將來自然可以供全國的參考、作全國的模範、爲什麽呢、有許多在内地辦敎育的、學師範的、往往都要到上海來考察「觀光」、假使上海市没有新的東西好的方法試騐出來、供人家觀摩、仍然和從前一樣、陳陳相因、那麽我們有什麽光榮呢、豈不成了觀而不光麽、不過、這種試騐新的方法、剏造新的東西、以期有所貢獻、實在是很艱難的工作、一方要敎學生、一面要埋頭研究、然後才可以把敎材及課程轉變到生産一條大路上來、一定有許多人說、我們現在敎書批改課卷練習簿、一天忙到晚、再呌我們研究、無異要我們的命、但是我們要想到國際壓迫的趨勢民族處境的危險、不得不積極進行、同時要想到上海的中小學敎員、比其他内地的同等中小學敎員、其生活環境却好得多、譬如在匪區、譬如在災區、並此而不可得、所以我們應該盡我們的力、</p>
<p>今天藉第三區敎育會開會的時候、能够把我對於敎育最近所感想到的話貢獻出來、這不能不感謝三區敎育會給我的機會、希望大家共同努力、定出一個改造敎育的基本原則、大家同心恊力的搜集材料、研究力案、作改造敎育的先鋒、惟有這樣、上海市的敎育才能起死回生、上海市的敎育能够起死回生、我相信可以風行全國、因爲大家的眼光都在那裏看上海的樣子、祗要上海轉變一個方向、内地也跟着轉變、幾乎可以說、我們今後的方針、就是全國中小學敎育的新趨勢、我們應該在中央敎育部注重生産敎育的指示之下、努力於實際的設施工作敎育部看到全國所需要的是敎材和課程的改革、也一定會採納着設法滿足全國的需要的、希望諸君爲生産敎育而努力、完了、（完）</p>

<h3 id="c218">藝術的形式和遺産的一點異議 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 野</p>
<p>辛人先生在「藝術的形式和遺産」一女中，把藝術的形式作爲作家的Sety，他以爲「藝術家首要的工作是從現實攝取了藝術的内容，其次是以那特有的天才，予以藝術底加工，在這加工的過程中，藝術家最大的努力，是在怎樣地覓得和内容相應，且能增加内容的影響力的形式，那藝術家的特殊底風格，來表現所攝取的現實諸事物，」在這一點上，是很容易使人陷於這一誤解即以爲：决定形式的，並不是内容，而乃是作家在其把所攝取的現實材料，與以藝術的加工這一過程中作家底風格底特殊性，所謂現實（現象底本質，本質的現象）底形象性的表現，無疑地是一種通過作家底意識的過程，即是說爲作家意識的地所表現的，但這裏也就存在着作家底藝術手腕，其表現方法底能動的，也即是「增加内容底影響力」的形式底作用。因而我們可以看出所謂作家底藝術的表現形式在這裏是表現爲第二的東西。在作家底藝術的製作過程中成爲第一義的東西，寗乃是作家對於現實底態度，也即是作家當從具體的客觀的現實中攝取其藝術的内容時的方法或觀點，以及把這材料怎樣表現出來。假如作家是一個嚴峻的現實主義者，那麽他所攝取自現實的材料以及怎樣把牠表現出來的形式也一定是現實主義的的。作家從現實中攝取了某一本質的斷面，那麽當藝術家把這予以藝術的那麽當藝術家把這予以藝術的加工即形象的地表現時，這種「怎樣」表現的表現形態也正是與爲其所攝取的現實底本質的斷面有着不可分離的合法則性在。而不是爲藝術家底「高興」所决定的，否則，作爲藝術家的作家就會陷於歪曲現實或不忠實地表現現實的這一危險中，過度地强調作家底風格底特殊性的結果，也是一樣。</p>
<p>「藝術作品之有「永久性」，是因爲那裏面有着立脚於現實的具體的（形象的）典型的事實和人物之故。而這些事物又是經過藝術家以總合的形式表現出來的……」藝術底社會的價值底評價，是基於把牠從藝術的表現譒譯爲社會學的表現，而確定其社會學的等價的。但這只是遺産承繼問題上工作底一部。這其中的主要底工作是着重在古典藝術底形式也即「怎樣表現」這一問題上的。這正是創作方法丨即他們在某一部分上可以提供我們以創作方法底提示的問題，即重新地檢定，正確地認識，「而由之以獲得新的技術，新的創作方法」的問題，而不是對於或一作家底。Style的模仿的問題。</p>
<p>「我們知道，莎士比亞，巴爾扎克，哥德，托爾斯泰那樣的藝術家，他們底意識是違背歷史的。然而因爲他們不斷地在現實中探求的結果，實踐底過程把他們的世界視逐漸地侵蝕，融解，……」像任白戈先生一樣，辛人先生也把巴爾扎克，托爾斯泰等等的世界視和創作方法的矛盾底解决，歸之於這些作家們底創作底實踐過程的結果。然而，在實際上，我以爲寗說是由於社會底變動。巴爾扎克和托爾斯泰底意識是違背歷史的，惟其如此，他們不曾圓滿地把握到世界觀和創作方法底統一，也正是這一點制約了他們底發展和表現於其作品中的動搖底意識。然而這一點仍不妨碍他們成爲一個現實主義者。</p>
<p>辛人先生以爲「藝術作品之有「永久性」，是因爲那裏面有着立脚於現實上的具體的（形象的）典型的事體和人物之故」，這正是說，藝術作品中所體現的現實是否有歷史性，社會性。牠用具體的形象去體現歷史底特定階級的現實（注意，並不是體現所謂「永久的人性」，即所謂「超歷史的」人類底，（至上的情感），因而在這一點上牠也是具有不下於形式底意義的。我們說某一作品底内容，並不僅僅是說及體現於其中的特定的現實的材料，寗乃是那種特定的現實的材料通過了形式已完成其藝術底價值後所表現出來的「綜合」，即是說不只牠底主題是具有現實性，充分地表現出特定歷史階級底本質，具有最高的積極性，而且牠底形式也是充分地發揮着主題底積極性，使其主題更加以有力的形式表現出來，這裏我們就不但發見了内容底决定的作用，同時還發見了形式底積極性，更確定了兩者底不可分性。古典作家底現實主義的創作方法，並不只是古典作家底寫實主義的表現形式，即描寫的手法的問題，同時也還是古典作家怎麽樣地從現實中攝取其材料而加以表現的問題，因而這裏就關聯到古典作家底創作方法底　體，而不是因爲「古典的偉大的藝術在思想方面旣和我們無緣，則可爲我們底遺産者，當在形式方面」遂抱遺産承繼問題局限於古典作家底「風格」的模倣或攝取上。因爲表現於古典作品中的並不只是那爲我們所要不得的思想，同時在其中還體現着活生生的歴史底眞實，和古典作家怎樣把握到這一現實更怎樣地加以表現這種創作方法底偉大性的體現之故。</p>
<p>因而我們可以說辛人先生之抱遺産承繼問題局限於古典作家底形式，以至於他們底風格上，是把問題太狹隘化了。（完）</p>

<p>船慢慢兒停下來。江上濁黄的泥浪，拍着八月江風舒徐的節拍，啦哩嘩啦的衝過來，又盪開去。</p>
<p>接客的小火輪的甲板上，我開始看見自由神像的翅膀，交換兩年前温和的眼光。垂垂欲暮的夕陽，用着巫婦的戀情，熱烈地吻着二十五層大厦的尖頂。</p>
<p>南國明朗天空下的懷戀，海邊企望的惦念，當我登陸的時候，便全都消散融和在一片歡悅的光景裏。街上是開着高速度的車，像都市血脈的循環，沿住平滑的柏油路水一般地流過去。</p>
<p>兩個人抽着帶有南方水波味的Abdulla,拖着悒鬱的身影，在殘陽渲染的簷下，跟着青烟的繚繞，飄起一段對話：</p>
<p>日子過得眞無聊啦，快兩年了。</p>
<p>對啦，畢業了，預備做什麽</p>
<p>只要有飯吃，什麽都成，可是，到現在還没頭緒。</p>
<p>說完，憮然地皺起眉頭，吐一口青烟，我不願再說下去了，同是負着生活重累的人呵？</p>
<p>風車型的荷蘭村，恬靜的燈光浸在四週，我們喝着濃郁的咖啡。低矮的墻壁，鑲上吉訶德式的中世紀騎士畫像，與緑色海波紋。疲倦的旅人給這周遭温親的淡淺的撫愛，昏昏然想到睡眠；想到過去，將來一個快樂的日子。</p>
<p>從紅紫燈交互地變換的闇海中，拿着威士忌刺自己的神經。柔波一樣平滑的球面，鑲着各式夜女人的臉，一些陌生的臉。時光溜得多快呵，青春的夢是短的，一忽兒給人擠走了。刹那給輕烟的愁緒怔住好一會，便吹着過時的口哨走了。</p>
<p>又是黄昏，在北站滬平聯運籃鋼裏，當旗子的搖落送行人的眼淚的時候。我回過頭來，盯住月臺那兒漸漸隠在人叢中的淌的逝影，口中不由得夢也似的說了：「晚安上海！」</p>

<p>— 楊邨人</p>
<p>秋天的時代，給了人們一顆秋天的心。</p>
<p>假如是冬天的話，雖然風雪連天，蟄伏着的虫虫就忍受着殘暴的襲擊，總還有一個春天快要到來的希望；而秋天，迎面快要到來的，却是風雪連天的冬令！</p>
<p>秋天不但使人愁悶，而且是使人憂鬱；没有愛，没有温暖，没有希望的氣候呵！</p>
<p>這時代，正是秋天一樣的：没有愛，没有温暖，没有希望。維特的時代是過去了，羅亭的時代也過去了，如今呵，那正是沙寗的時代。</p>
<p>由奮鬥而幻滅，幻滅了再奮鬥，前進的心鼓勵着青年們伸直了背脊骨，而終於還是得到了一個空虚，那是秋天呵，這時代。</p>
<p>說是要睜開眼睛看看啦，這時代是冬令，春天快要到來了；然而，說說的話，我也會說說的，而望望原野，現實正是木葉蕭蕭下的秋天。</p>
<p>木葉蕭蕭下的秋天，有的人愛她的白雲，有的人愛她的明月，有的人幽閒地在欣賞着東籬下的菊花，然而我，正預感着風雪連天的冬令快要到來了。</p>
<p>秋的心，愁悶憂鬱的心，寂寞着戰慄的心呵！</p>
<h3 id="c221">珍珠姊（下） <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 陳學昭</p>
<p>女高小畢業後，我們便自分散了，我被家裏送到一個離家鄕很遠的女子中學去，我再見不到珍珠姊了，她的影子，只有在假期裏我還家鄕的時候，往郵政局去，經過春暉堂，又從我的腦子裏惆悵地映起了一次。她的狀况，她的一切，我是完全模糊了，只是在人家不正確的傳說中，得到一點想像的資料。但我知道她與我表姊的感情却是很好的繼續着的，我表姊與我也早已斷絕了往來，但她升學到上海後，閙了許多不很得意的事，這是本鄕的人大家都知道的。</p>
<p>我年假，暑假還來，母親總把一些我離鄕期間裏所産生的事告訴我，特别是關於我當年那些女同學的事。</p>
<p>「…呀，話起珍珠姊，她已經訂婚了。」</p>
<p>「不，她已做親了，」我的大嫂嫂在旁邊校正。</p>
<p>以後的事，我只知道她嫁的是從杭州一個醫校學出來的醫生，但是並没有行醫，一天到晚在家裏閒蕩，鴉片烟瘾很大，小夫婦倆租了周後頭王家的屋子住着，因爲珍珠姊的翁是在硤石做生意的，婆剛死，一個小姑剛出嫁。接着，便是珍珠姊頭生産了一個男孩子。</p>
<p>這回，我已四年多没有回家鄕。偶然在一個同鄕的喜酒席上，遇到了表姊。</p>
<p>「怎麽你也在北平？」她見了我有點驚奇，又有一點近於羞慚的說。</p>
<p>「是的，」我說，「我們竟到今日纔得機會碰見。」特然我的腦子裏閃起了伊的結拜姊姊的影子。</p>
<p>我與表姊自出本鄕女高小，至今已十四年，還是第一次遇見。</p>
<p>「珍珠姊現在怎樣？」我猶預了一下，終於問。</p>
<p>「她已死了！」表姊有點爲難的神氣回答。</p>
<p>「呀！」我不由自主的喊了起來，伊的回答，實在太遠離我心中的期待了。</p>
<p>我的驚奇與悲悵大約不自禁的流露了出來，表姊望着我，她的神氣再没有剛才的爲難了，可說是安靜的，友誼的，對我說：</p>
<p>「我也不知道她究竟是什麽病死的，新哥哥說她是癆病」。</p>
<p>「新哥哥？」</p>
<p>「就是珍珠姊的丈夫，他是學醫的。」</p>
<p>「呀！」</p>
<p>停了一歇，我問：</p>
<p>「他不是抽鴉片的麽？」我忍不住的把我對珍珠姊的惋惜表示了出來：「她怎麽願意嫁一個抽鴉片的？」</p>
<p>「是呀！我也這樣想，」於是表姊便長長的把珍珠姊的與這個鴉片鬼的結合叙述起來了：</p>
<p>「他們在不曾結婚之前，就早已通信了，人家來說親，珍珠姊的後母倒很好，說不願把珍珠送落烟窩，拒絕了，但是珍珠姊自己要求說非他不嫁的，他們那時早已互相通信，這是新哥哥的姊姊拉成的。我勸她不要與這人結婚，勸她變賣了手飾，也可拿這錢來用以贖書，學一點獨立生活的技能，就是要嫁人也可以嫁個比這好點的。李先生也來這樣勸她過丨丨李先生就是那位我二哥愛的體操女敎員，珍珠姊的另一個結拜姊妹丨丨她說她甘願嫁他，抽鴉片她也不在乎，如果棄他，未免太不義了…其實那時候，要讀書她也不可能了的，她的手飾統統都被新哥哥的姊姊騙去給新哥哥吸鴉片吸掉了的。」</p>
<p>我聽了這些話，心中不免打了一個寒戰，我的腦子裏映起一個專會「打哈哈」的珍珠姊來了，一個快樂人的珍珠姊。然而我仔細想想，覺得這種事不是從天空掉下來的，却可說是珍珠姊的性格做成的，我記起當她與我最好的時候，我常常與她談升學，我有着很大的求知的慾望，她呢，可不然，她只要弄些東西吃吃，著著，戴戴，玩玩，打打麻雀，除此以外，她愛看「倭袍」，「粉妝樓」，「珍珠塔」……這一類的小說，「如果棄他，未免太不義了…」她是何等的想學做一個這類小說裏的女主角呀！然而結果呢？想到這裏，我不覺深深的嘆了一口氣。</p>
<p>表姊還是繼續的叙述珍珠姊他們的事：</p>
<p>「在生孩子的時候，我曾見了珍珠姊一次，她那時候好好的，後來我再到她家，她已病了，新哥哥說是癆病，他還說她活不到一年的了…」</p>
<p>「那他看她接近死去，也不替她想想法子麽？」</p>
<p>表姊不出聲，似乎也沈在這個疑問中。</p>
<p>現在，我每次往郵政局去，經過春暉堂，我腦子裏總免不了的要映起珍珠姊的影子，並且引起了好些一貫的聯想，我四哥自與一個有錢的女子結婚後就沉在賭博裏，完全墮落了，我想四哥假使與珍珠姊結了婚或者不至於墮落，珍珠姊或者也不至於死得那麽早罷……然而，聯想的末了，在珍珠姊那「打哈哈」的快樂人的影子上，蒙了一重黑幕，在我的惆悵的心上，增了一重凄清。</p>
<p>一九三四，五月十六日</p>
<h3 id="c222">鄕長先生（二十八） <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 王任叔</p>
<p>「一案未了一案又起，我也不當鄕長了！你别拖住我！你别拖住我！」馮文先生搖着頭，討饒。立刻感到「立正」「舉槍」這滋味不容易嘗。而自己老婆看不起自己，丢了自己到外面作活去，也是有緣故的。「新做泥，碰到閏六月，」可不是嗎？</p>
<p>冬生瘸手這回已經嚇得面色像泥土似地，楞了一回，往後門逃了出去了。</p>
<p>開暘，阿賢，阿得……這些人却想不過來似的呆住。好像給土匪丨丨不，給「數」，給「命」弄死的，不是阿召，而是他們自己。</p>
<p>「阿彌陀佛！殺千刀的土匪，斬萬刀的土匪呀！」開暘的媽，一把眼淚，一把鼻涕，勸着阿召的老婆。一臉的泥土夾着涕淚流。</p>
<p>喝完了最後一杯酒，木仁老拖着條檀樹大砲那麽大的瘋脚，踏出了門。</p>
<p>「他媽的！這是個什麽世界！」</p>
<p>駡着去了。</p>
<p>大生先生搖着頭。然而還勸着阿召老婆說：</p>
<p>「阿召媳子！你别閙了。人死了，再也活不過來了。喪葬料理，一切費用，明天村裏開捐。往後我還向縣裏請一塊匾，說阿召是個烈士，是爲了第二次世界大戰殉身的。那麽你也名利雙收了！」</p>
<p>「但是，我要阿召呀！我要我底天呀！天呀……天呀！……」於是阿召老婆坐起地上，放長聲音聲韻抑揚地哭了起來！</p>
<p>「他媽的！這是什麽世界！」</p>
<p>大脚瘋木仁老，把那條瘋脚拖得遠遠的，也把這句駡聲，拖得遠遠的了。（完）</p>

<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>革命不如革心，物質建設，不如心理建設，大家都知道了。國貨問題，也是這樣。與其說提倡國貨，不如說信仰國貨。假使勉强的服用國貨，還是不必去勉强爲是。有的爲面子關係、而服用國貨，我不贊成，有的怕人說話，而服用國貨，吾更不贊成。凡是中國人，服用中國貨，是人人的本分，人人的天賦，完全從眞性中流露，完全從心坎中發出，無所用其勉强，無所用其掩飾。掛羊頭，賣狗肉，一般奸商，把那仇貨外貨充做國貨賣，眞是殺不可赦，罪不勝誅。</p>
<p>汪精衛先生最近在雙十節國貨公司開幕的時候說：「買國貨的人，不要買了與外國貨相較，中國貨縱不好，亦要覺得比外國貨好。」這幾句話，完全是引起我國民對於國貨的信心，眞是十分澈底，十分明白，十分有味。</p>
<p>汪氏又說：「買貨的人，要十分仔細的把貨物審愼抉擇，不要上了人家的當。在賣貨的人，要把物品選擇得精益求精，且把權利思想看得輕些。」總之，爲着國貨起見，賣方買方，都要有一種信心，發爲力量，爲任何思想運動不可搖撼。</p>

<h3 id="c224">急需施行的「國貨敎育」 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>怎樣是「國貨敎育」丨那末我的答覆是「國貨敎育」爲一種以振興國貨作中心的新興敎育，它是用敎育的方式，來感化一般人對於國貨的認識，並授與實際上生産的學識及技術，使全國人們都能感覺到提倡國貨的重要，且就可去實踐他們所感覺到的任務，使在敎育的塲合上，把我們固有的崇拜洋貨心理，予與重大的轉變，而經濟自給，自己的生産量與消費量平衡，將整個民族的繁榮，爲其基礎的。」</p>
<p>所以在這裏，我們應加注意的，就是我們過去一向對於提倡國貨的設施，總是努力於生産運動具體的推進，純以主觀的理想，去謀充實國貨的本身，來和猖狂的外貨抗衡爲對象，這樣，關係民衆心理的建設，謀如何去以一種偉大的敎育力量去感化，薰陶，那麽這一點，我們却始終未予引用，當然是過去一件最足認爲遺憾的事。</p>
<p>因此，在現下，我們立在國人「洋貨熱」高到極度的觀點上，對於國貨敎育施行的重要，自然是早成了我人目下最急迫的工作，並且，他的進行路綫，以我的意見，大致可分爲學校與社會二個本位，因爲前者是陶冶全國青年的塲所，後者却係予與一般廣大民衆的園地，兹分别討論如下：</p>
<p>一·學校　學校是養成知識階級的處所，他本負有逗發兒童愛國心理，與陶冶學生高尙人格的責任，那麽，在這時候，該如何努力去闡揚國貨的精神，去薰陶學生，像國貨敎材的編訂，國貨標語，口號的宣揚，自然都是國貨敎育中的主要者。</p>
<p>二·社會　施行「國貨敎育」的範圍，當然不僅單以學校的學生爲限，卽社會上一般廣大的民衆，實也有同樣的迫切，像過去國貨展覽會，國貨陳列館的舉行和設立，當然也是「國貨敎育」中的一種，不過，以後我們應如何引用新的方式，去增加他發揚宣傳的能力，獲到「事半功倍」之效果。</p>
<p>總之，於國貨振興，生産增加的過程上「國貨敎育」的意義與使命，是不能稍容忽視的，我敬敢以最大的熱忱，有望於從事國貨運動諸君，速須注意此點，着手進行，那麽，他的成效之日，一定就國家經濟，民族工業的繁榮與振興呢！</p>

<p>今年是舉國共曉的婦女國貨年，做一個中國的婦女，固然應該切切實實的服用國貨，就是一般的男同胞們，尤其應該切切實實的購用國貨，來扶助婦女們推銷國貨，生産國貨，使中國的偉大的國貨運動，在男女同胞共同努力，站在一條戰綫的情形之下，得到極大的發展，極大的成功，和極好的成績。</p>
<p>可是，理論雖然如此，其事實上的表現，究竟是怎樣呢？唉！說來眞够我們痛心，眞够我們憤慨，在婦女國貨年之中，報紙上却時常刋載各項貨物入超的消息，現在約略的記一些在下面，以證我言之不謬：</p>
<p>（一）瓷器及口香糖之入口，在七月份，共有六十九萬七千五百五十九元之多。</p>
<p>（二）呢帽的進口，僅僅七月份的統計，共達八五，六三六金單位，折合國幣爲十七萬零八百四十四元，比較去年同期，增加二倍。</p>
<p>（三）全國捲菸的入超，在八月份，共爲四萬萬元，差不多每個中國的同胞，都要負担一元的入超數量。</p>
<p>（四）婦女用於裁製衣服上的花邊，上半年的入超，爲二九二，一九五金單位，折合國幣共爲五十七萬七千九百六十二元。</p>
<p>（五）兒童的玩具，過去八個月的統計，其入超數爲六十六萬四千萬元</p>
<p>（六）……</p>
<p>够了，僅僅在幾項的統計，已使我們詫異，已使我們驚奇？同時更使我們十分痛心，唉！婦女國貨年的結果，如此，這不特是婦女界的恥辱，同時也是整個民族的奇恥大辱，却是一件使人十分痛心的事。</p>
<p>現在，婦女國貨年的時間，已過了三分之二以上的時期了，在未了的七八十天之中，我們該如何的努力，來打下一個服用國貨的信念，生産國貨的决心，而設法雪滌這個莫大的奇恥大辱呢？這個責任，不特是婦女們應該負起，同時，我們男子們，也應該切切實實的担負起來呢？</p>
<h3 id="c226">提倡國貨的「大衆化」 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>「本年六個月内，婦女化妝品的輸入爲八十多萬元。」</p>
<p>「本埠熱心提倡國貨的諸女士，蒐集各種日用國貨品物，到内地去展覽推銷。」</p>
<p>上面這兩個消息，絕對是矛盾的。眞令人一則以喜；一則以懼。懼的事情不必講了，因爲「已往事情譬如死」？只要今後的努力，亡羊補牢，也有相當的效力。所以我來說說國貨展覽和推銷的方法，聊備諸位愛國女士的參考。</p>
<p>智識階級中的人，他們當然知道提倡國貨，是目下救國唯一的要圖。不過一般低級的人，他們管甚麽國貨不國貨，只要貨色好，價錢巧，他們便爭光購買。在都會或是内地，這般低級的很多。我們提倡國貨，不要專注目在「布爾喬亞」的身上；也要注意到這般低級的人們身上去。所以宣傳的方法，着實要研究。</p>
<p>對低級的人說法，「文字遠不如圖畫；圖畫又不如歌唱；歌唱又不如戲劇。」這是一般人公認的。到内地去推銷國貨；或是把國貨商品展覽。單靠幾張傳單；或是借一處地方像博物院般把商品陳列一下，那功效簡直等於零。我以爲在没有講到提倡國貨的本文以前，先借一個公共的塲所表演戲劇，請一般民衆來參觀。戲中所表演的當然是目下國家貧弱的情形；以及用外貨的害處。等大衆明白了，然後轉到本題，勸大衆購用國貨；並且便把國貨的物品及商標等，說給他們聽，使他們牢牢的記住。此外再編成幾隻通俗而又淺顯的小曲，敎他們唱。唱會了常常掛在口頭，他們的腦筋裏又多一重刻痕。至於觸目驚心的圖畫，也有相當的功效，不妨在會塲張掛；或是印成單張，發給大衆。這樣的做法，對於智識階級中人，譬如打一針嗎啡針，也可使他們精神興奮一下。對於低級的人，使他們明瞭一切，倒是絕好的民衆敎育咧！</p>
<p>報紙的勸告；文字的宣傳，在别國是有效力的。至於吾們的貴國裏，實在識字的人太少了；看報紙的人也不及别國人的普遍，所以用這類方法，簡直像「頂了石臼做戲」，大有吃力不討好的神氣。至於表演戲劇和歌唱小曲，那是頂合一般人的口胃，我想試騐起來。决不會失敗的；也許有意想不到之收獲，也未可知。</p>

<h3 id="c227">泰縣國展會的廻溯 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— 耘飱</p>
<p>泰縣，是僻處江北的一個小城市，今年在秋的降臨，紅葉尙未蕭蕭墮地的時候，由黨政商等團體，發起了一次國貨展覽會；範圍當然是渺小，只不過喚起全縣士女們的注意！它的成績和印象，拿全國來做比例，自然是滄海之一粟了；不過僅就都市閙什麽「國貨年」，「婦女國貨年，」和許多的國貨展覽會，我恐怕内地人士，甚至都市裏晝伏夜動之徒，連這幾個字的意義都譯釋不出來吧？我們曉得集腋可以成裘，衆志可以成城的兩句通常慣語，國貨運動就非深入民間不可，絕不是偏枯提倡能收到悠久遠大效果的；因此這個渺小的縣城國展會，就值得寫出來廻溯一下了；地址在邑廟，東西轅門，高聳着兩座松柏牌樓；又在商肆繁闐的中山門，也搭了一座松柏牌樓，往來的行人，眸子裏没有見過的稀罕，駐足觀看的人兒肩摩踵接，會塲裏五六進大雄寳殿式的屋宇，每一進房屋，都有一面碩大無朋的天井，這種　里許的左右兩廊，開滿了國貨商店，每天的遊人，眞是空巷來觀，小城市未有的壯舉；如坡子街的天成泰，廣泰，天福，這幾家綢緞布疋莊的巨擘，都在會塲佔了很大地位，設有臨時商塲；籐椅店，藥材店，紙烟舖子，瓷碗舖子，也是當塲的中心陳設；紙烟和籐製器皿，還能够吸引觀衆，因爲他們多少有些櫉窗學，知道在「展覽」兩個字上用些功夫；綢緞布疋，似乎太墨守陳規了；没有什麽新的表現，給參觀者一個深的印象；在泰縣這個破天荒的偉大運動，總算開了縣志的新紀録；張縣長還恐怕縣民不十分踴躍的參觀，特地僱了一班徽戲，利用邑廟舊有的劇辜，大家以爲有白戲（不花錢）可看，所以每天總在萬人以上，居然把一座邑廟擠的水洩不通；我幻想主持展會的團體，眞會利用節令，這個新秋，是内地一般小布爾喬亞的收穫時期，便是鄕村的佃農，這兩天也得甦一些時候，商量嫁娶，添製新衣，因此國展會倒小小地發了一注財源；我很希望各縣黨政機關，大家能殼繼起仿效，倒是國貨前途一綫比較實惠的曙光咧。</p>
<h3 id="c228">浦東區之國貨展覽會 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— 葉期百</p>
<p>在上海市内的商業區中，我們知道，已經辦了好幾次的「國貨展覽會」和臨時的「國貨商塲」：就是事實上，在現在，在上海市的商業區内，也已經有好幾處的固定商塲，是出賣國貨的，如天后宫橋市商會那一所，和南市社會局原址那一所，以及「蓬萊市塲」等等。然而，在工業區，在市宅區，在商業區附近的鄕區，關於大規模的「臨時國貨商塲」，或「國貨展覽會」，尙屬少見。</p>
<p>這一次「上海市浦東區國貨展覽會」的創設，不能不令我們有莫大之欣喜。何也？蓋挽回利權，首重振興實業；提倡國貨，厥惟擴大宣傳。然而欲宣傳之得有時間上空間上的擴大，那末，惟有在各處遍設「國貨展覽會」之舉。今次浦東爛泥渡所以有「國貨展覽會」也，一則，以地點而言，雖是黄浦一江之隔，然而「洋貨店」的林立，亦實足以驚人，故而舉行「國貨展覽會」，確實是必要；二則，以學校敎育與社會敎育的程度而言，究不如上海遠甚，故而購用國貨的習慣，亦確有宣傳其養成之必要；三則，爛泥渡是一個工廠區，人口的密度，當</p>
<p>然較他處爲大；故而，更有舉行「國貨展覽會」的必要。</p>
<p>作者今年執敎在浦東，更近於這個「國貨展覽會」。聞除展覽各種國貨之外，更有當事者請當地各中小學校學生，有「國貨演說比賽」之舉；一以鼓勵學生，對購用國貨之認識；二是寓有宣傳的性質，法至善也。</p>
<p>但我最後是有幾點希望，寫述於後，尙祈當事者採納：</p>
<p>一，展覽地點宜多，如高橋，吳淞，龍華，江灣等處，均有時時舉行，或固定設一「國貨商塲」之必要。</p>
<p>二，展覽時間宜長，或一月，或二月，更或三月，半年等；如此，則印象亦可深矣。</p>
<p>三，使觀衆或購衆，源源不絕而來，並且，更能增其興趣。</p>
<p>四，利用學生，鼓勵學生，作種種有實效之宣傳。</p>
<p>五，鼓勵購衆和觀衆之介紹和宣傳。</p>
<p>六，以後舉行此種展覽會，更要有文字的和圖畫的，說明的大規模之宣傳。</p>
<p>七，儘量徵求購衆和觀衆的購用國貨用品以後的改良意見，藉此而將貨品，求其絕頂的精良。</p>
<p>上述七點，是否有當，敬請指正。</p>
<p>一週間國貨界新訊</p>
<p>（一）實業部批復上海市商會舶來品不得用國貨商標，違者應以欺罔公衆論罪。</p>
<p>（二）上海市社會局主辦之上海市第六屆國貨運動大會，定十一月十二日在蓬萊市塲開幕。</p>
<p>（三）長沙各法團組織提倡國貨會，五日成立，繼續抵貨精神。</p>
<p>（四）華商紗廠聯合會，近因財政部擬加棉紗統稅，並有於十一月一日起實行之說，羣情惶恐，該會特函關務署，轉懇孔部長請予免增。</p>
<p>（五）南京國貨公司浦東國展會均曾於雙十節開幕。</p>
<p>（六）津浦路各站設國貨販賣所。</p>
<p>（七）廣州大中華國貨市塲，集資五百餘萬，興建巨厦，搜羅全國精美國貨，陳列展覽，業已開幕，近復在滬組設辦事處，各廠商欲謀事業之發展可前往登記，接洽展覽事務。</p>

<p>「…完了，我王子榮是個一無所有的人，當然談不到什麽，不過三寸不爛之舌，還得存在，可以向諸君作口頭上的宣傳，大家看一看，現在的局面，眞是可憐之至，東北四省，非但没有收復，它們更有窺探平津的危險，市塲之上，它們生産過剩的貨品，一天一天的增</p>

<p>多。這不能怪别人，都應當怪我們自己的不好。經過了九一八不算數，還來了一個更切近的一二八，那大砲和炸彈轟轟聲，還不能驚醒它們的迷夢…」我也在那個曠塲之上，聽見王子榮說到這裏，不願意再聽下去，</p>
<p>這是民國二十一年的九一八。</p>
<p>「…一年一年的過，把我在二十年</p>
<p>九一八之後的演說重新一想，那眞是慚愧到不知什麽程度，現在它們依然步步進逼，生産過剩的貨品，依然不斷的向我國市塲上力事推銷，我眞想不穿中國人竟有這般的勇敢。見了槍不嚇，見了炸彈不怕，一般買它們貨品的人，當然不會了解買它們貨品，就是自己買槍子炸彈吃啊！我們一般清醒的人們啊！這不是自殺的路途嗎？所以我自始到現在，不管有人是否聽從我的話，我總以勸人服用國貨，作我的天職。倒底一人之力有限，一件驚天動地的偉業成功，原不是簡單地出諸一二人之手，就可辦成，所以有千人走路，一人爲首的話，假如爲首的人專門向前跑，而後面的人，軟洋洋的一步也不移動，而且還有退步，這是委實是没有辦法了，…」我聽王子榮在那個曠塲上這樣說。</p>
<p>這是民國二十二年的九一八。</p>
<p>「…迷夢的人，當然是昏昏沈沈，不過聰明的人，却都是成了迷夢的人，試翻閱現在的報紙，有七大奸商販賣它們大批，顔料咧，××號購進大批×貨咧，更有海關報告的驚人的巨數咧。種種消息，不一而足。你想幹這種事件的人，如果眞是迷夢者，我想决不會幹吧！他們這樣的不避艱險，不怕炸彈，無非是爲了幾個錢，爲了幾個錢，就這樣的一切都不管的去幹，這眞是國家之蠹，社會之賊。這班人一日不除，卽國家一日不幸，我們手無寸鐡，當然奈何他們不得。…」王子榮依然年常舊規的在那曠塲之上在演說，後來繼續着說：</p>
<p>「…倒底是人心還没有盡死，有著名國貨廠商九家，聯合起來，在九一八一週紀念，創辦了九廠國貨臨時商塲，偉大的中國國貨公司，就繼續産生在九一八國貨臨時商塲之後的，九一八二週年，九一八國貨臨時商塲，也開第二屆；本年度是第三屆。南塲附設在中國國貨公司，他們努力於國貨宣傳，不稍懈怠，這是值得推戴的…」</p>

<p>甘油的用途很廣，許多成品和它都有密切的關係；但是我國從前不能自造，所用的甘油都是外國貨，因爲成本昻貴，製成的貨品往往不能和外貨競爭！</p>
<p>自從五洲第二廠創製國産星球牌甘油以來，營業很好；如像本埠的中國化學，永和，家庭，先施，美星，華成，南洋等各大實業工廠，都是盡量的購用，這當然由於它是價廉物美的原故。最近傳來一個更可喜的消息，那就是有一家德國洋行，向五洲定購星球牌甘油五十噸，預備發到印度孟買地方，聽說還要繼續定購，國産的科學原料，能够推銷到外國，當然要算這星球牌甘油是新例，同時它的成分和價值，也就可想而知了。</p>

<p>— 金俠聞</p>
<p>太倉土布，自太嘉寳救濟會提倡改良以來，經過可分三時期：（一）勸導織户，改闊門面，放長尺梢。（二）旣成出品，究竟有無銷路，隨處陳列試銷。（三）探聽買户之意見，花色何者最爲入時；尺寸是否相宜。自二十一年秋，從太倉之璜涇鄕入手改良以後，經過許多之時日，及同志之研究，直至今春，三個問題，漸漸解决。（一）鄕人本以織布爲副業，因土布銷路斷絕，只好束手待斃。現在旣可貸紗織布；又可得工錢餬口，所以隨便你放闊門面也好，放長尺梢也好，一經招貼改良，不待勸導。紛至沓來，取紗織布，此第一問題，最易解决。（二）吾人自着手改良土布，凡屬同志，均惴惴焉恐銷路之難，如果無路可銷，則成貨山積，以一疋一元計，萬金可立時告罄。然吾人抱絕大勇氣，以爲布非别樣可比，卽無銷路，有貨存在，可以自己服用。於是極力推銷，始荷潘仰堯先生介紹銷售於國貨商塲。第一次胃口尙好，孰知二三次以後，胃鈍銷滯，貨價大跌；繼復商同上海縣農民敎育館土布商店代銷，亦不甚旺。然此鄕下土布，已能陳列於上海市塲；穿着於上海之愛國男女身上，私心大幸，以爲銷路有把握矣，不過遲早耳。今春有一親戚，海州歸來，青年愛國，以銷售土布至隴海一帶自任，盡太倉及海上所積存之貨，挾之以去，不三月，貨欵悉數匯來，函催解貨，並謂：「愈多愈妙」，奈以存貨已罄，農忙織户暫停，無以應付，從此第二問題可以解决。（三）上海着户，螞蟻羅席花已厭陳舊，須多變花樣；顔色須用陰士丹林不褪色且鮮明者，最爲合宜，布之尺寸，以一尺四寸門面，用製女旗袍，可獨幅裁剪不合縫，尺梢以二丈三尺，丨丨可作旗袍兩件。每疋售價一元四角，則每件不過七角，經濟亦較爲合算。至於海州一帶，銷路不然，是處向着常熟太倉（璜涇）之土布，門面不過八寸，今則門面至一尺三寸，衣袖不至找頭，褲脚管不甚兜角，已經合用。顔色一端，現在尙可隨便，一二年以後，恐亦須加以改進，此丨丨第三問題，亦可告一段落。因此三問題，已經解决；而於是作進一步之研究。吾太廿五鄕，能織布者居半數以外，現在從璜涇一鄕着手；且於一鄕中選擇織户四十家試辦，貸紗織布。每家每天織一疋，一月出貨有一千二百疋，統扯成本須一千六百四十元，若銷至海州，到節結賬，則須成本四千八百餘元，機上繼續紡織，又須預備一批貨色，則資本將近一萬。如果擴充至全縣，則又遞加而上之，目前成貨，可不蝕本，如果一吃莊欵，加了拆息，則土布必至加價，銷路必受影響，則經費成一大問題，丨丨丨海州一帶。方四百里，本爲洋布盛銷之區，今受提倡國貨宣傳之影響，愛國熱心，風起雲湧，偶見市上陳列改良土布，無不熱烈樂購，所以太倉璜涇之出貨；連同上海顓橋之出品，繼續寄去，尙不够海州一處之銷路：其實此外如南京鎭江蘇州杭州北平天津山東各處之愛國男女，服用土布者，决非少數。只要經濟問題，有一辦法，不難廣爲售銷；至於門面，顔色，改進方法，一時所辦不到，而亦不可不研究者。手織土布擲梭者門面不過一尺四五寸，如果改爲拉梭，則門面可至二尺。上海市上銷路，二尺門面，最爲合用。今爲維持家庭手工業及救濟農村起見，不得不就原有擲梭織户，加以改良，將來一定還想每織户發拉梭布機一架，令其學習。至於染色不褪，非用德國陰士丹林不可，惟用料如何可不浪費；如何設色鮮明，學習手術，頗不容易，此又作將來進一步之研究，淺陋如余，蓄諸懷中已久，不得不將經過及研究，就正於國貨專家，尙祈不吝指敎爲幸！</p>

<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第三回　未解飄零窺門憐少女願聞困苦惜玉訪貧家</p>
<p>那女孩抬着眼皮對他看着微笑了一笑，將身子一閃，閃到屋檐的柱子下去了。那小脚婦人跟着後面道：不還要看看嗎？跑什麽？那姑娘笑道：這樣多人，跑到人家屋子裏去，怪難爲情的，走罷，我不看了。那小脚婦人且不理他，却向茶房丢了個眼色。茶房站在房門口，又向屋子裏的張介夫看看，見他臉上有笑容，便向小脚婦人道：他旣是不要看了，你帶他到前面大樓下去玩玩罷。等一會子，我送衣服到你家裏去。那婦人微笑着點點頭，帶了那姑娘走了。他們一走，這裏，就開始議論起來。李士廉笑道：倒是頂好的一個人，再修飾一下子，準是上中等人才。張介夫口裏啣了捲烟，踏着拖鞋走出來，笑着向程志前道：我是逢塲作戲，聽到說這位姑娘，是投親不遇，要帶了兩代人賣身投靠的我想這女孩子倒有心胸，所以要看看。李兄說的話不錯，我們是到這裏來謀事的，豈能够作荒唐事。程志前歎了一口氣，覺得是不對，又微笑了一笑。張介夫又不知道他是什麽命意，便向茶房道：我們也不好讓人家白來一趟。你看要給他幾毛錢？說着，伸手至衣服袋裏去摸着。茶房笑道：錢倒是不要。這胡家嫂子說了，這孩子一家三口，他是個少年寡婦，怎樣供養得起。祗望趕快替這姑娘找個人家，作三房二房，都不拘，他有個奶奶有個娘，安頓得有飯吃就行了。程志前，兩手插在西服褲裝裏搖搖頭道：這怕很難吧若是作二房三房，上面少不得還有個大太太，本人能不能容納下去，還是問題呢？誰能保證養他家兩代的人呢，（四二）</p>

<p>— 沙永采</p>
<p>提起了三國時的張桓侯，眞個是誰人不曉。他的尊相，據市井傳說，是個黑臉虬髯的醜漢鼻祖。他的性情，又據說是個暴跳如雷的鹵莽天尊。他這兩項特點，也同他的大名一樣，共垂千古。凡是在舞臺前瞧瞧的，和書塲裏坐坐的，對於他，腦筋裏大都有這樣一個影像。</p>
<p>但是在正史上去考據，桓侯的相貌性情，却並不如俗傳的那樣惡劣。據古本名臣傳裏的張飛傳中所述：他的行相，是「燕頷環眼，形容甚偉。」可知他不過是頷和眼比常人異樣一點而已。他的性情，是「性烈爽，有急智，每戰輒多奇策。」可見他非但不暴躁，並且還有才智，並不是個目不識丁的莽漢。大約後世人的所以會誤傳他是個鹵莽天尊的原由，就是誤解在「烈爽」兩個字上吧。</p>
<p>在四川省的北部閬中縣一帶，於蜀漢時，本就是桓侯的鎭守地，現在他的墓還在那裏。所以那處，頗多桓侯廟，廟中塑像，大都很雍容肅穆，並不滿臉鍋灰樣的怕人。這正和史傳所載，兩相符合。最近又據北平報載，湖社社長金君的談話，據說：「蜀漢時之張飛，善畫，畫美人尤多入妙處，並擅書法，字體秀健，現尙可尋之於古代碑碣中云云。」據此則桓侯不獨富才智，更多風雅事了。徒以史傳鮮於此項記載，而市井演義文多過分形容，遂使數千年後，穿鑿附會，盡失眞相，可慨也夫！</p>

<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>生平不很高興拍照，我嘗指拍照的技師是自由的侵犯者，假使他們的審美觀念確實高明，那我亦就折服了，立，定要人筆端筆整，像一株石筍。坐，定要人右腿擱在左腿上，不風雅的硬呌他風雅。不笑的定呌裝笑，笑了又不許露出牙齒，頭怎樣放，脚怎樣伸，都要聽他的指揮，照相館的拍照室比司令部的看押所更不自由，更受壓制，化錢買苦吃，智者不爲也。</p>
<p>我的朋友中有不少「現代青年」，除十四Ｋ金自來水筆，蔡司白金眼鏡，扁形時錶…等件外，並各備照相機一架，人均以爲我必能常得不化錢拍照之機會矣，豈知大謬不然，蓋我的朋友們皆以藝術爲立塲，醜陋如我者没一點合得上藝術的條件。研究拍照藝術的人，除風景，靜物，牲畜足以採爲材料外，當以女人最爲合色，故免費攝影的權利，女人享受獨多。每逢旅行野遊時，見朋友們均各挾女友攝取種種姿態，不禁生「恨不生爲女兒身」之感。</p>
<p>世界上拍照被拍得最多的，當推要人與電影明星。昨遊城隍廟，見各照相館都取要人明星照相懸諸門首，且在旁大書「特别大减價」等字樣，以作招徠廣告，見者引爲異趣。</p>

<p>— 朱少飛</p>
<p>大概在春秋兩季裏到過我們東山的人，誰都要上山嘗嘗那别有風味的野茶，在春天有鳥語花香，秋天有那透紅了的楓葉片片，滿眼的畫情詩意，呌人戀戀不捨。</p>
<p>東山的特産丨雨前，碧螺春等像銀絲般的細芽茶，冲上一杯，其味津津，喝野茶用着這兩種茶葉正够得多風雅呢，竃是拾石而砌，柴可就地而拾，水取之於山澗裏的涓涓清流。</p>
<p>地址常在一般人家的古墳前，或者較深的山塢裏，前山當推那新廟上的壽墳，後山有槎灣塢裏的薛家墳，這兩處都是去喝野茶的好去處，因爲那邊有光滑的石檯石凳，與蒼翠繁茂的松柏，假使興致高的話，帶着牌玩上幾圈麻雀，旣可評泉品茗，又得遊山玩水，一舉兩得，何樂而不爲呢。</p>
<p>這幾天適值返里，又得幼年二三同窗好友，相約每天午飯後到薛家墳喝野茶，都没有玩牌的興致，各拿着愛讀的書報雜誌一切應用的銅壺茶杯等用具，跨着輕快的脚步，踏上那崎嶇的山路，到了目的地！</p>
<p>輪流的燒火，汲水，拾柴，轉瞬間壺中的水聲沸騰了，每個兒冲一杯，於是。看書的看書，散步的散步，直到太陽西下，鳥獸歸巢的時候，纔興盡而返。</p>

<h3 id="c253">日本料理（下） <a href="#c253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>飲酒後，即可用筷取菜（日本筷經過消毒，用紙袋封好，用時拆封，把筷取出，筷是木做的，一端削成兩支，一端相連，用兩手拉開，）到了第二次上正菜每人有一個飯桶送來，吃飯切不可大嚼，露出餓鬼樣子，取碗吃湯應指定一雙手，不可左右亂換，等到第四次菜上後，來賓應當敬謝主人好意，其後隨已所好，在菜盤上選吃，因爲菜肴很多，究不能全部吃完，俏若不能吃，可把第三四次的菜留下不吃，祗吃些香物（如生菜蘿蔔醬菜等）等到吃畢，有開水拿來，即把吃過飯碗，令女用人冲開水，把飯碗内的飯屑，連開水一併吃下去。</p>
<p>（二）略式的宴會菜　這是在菜館所辦的普通宴會席，上菜的順序，先爲羹湯，次爲二膳，又次爲三膳，末爲正菜。酒則比菜先出，儘可隨意注飲，不過菜單，依各店的情形而不同，普通先上前菜，（有鹹，酸，甜，辣種種，裝在一個分格的盆中，任客人自取所好的）這時客人應當把各式各樣的菜，都取一些，表示都愛吃的樣子。第二次進羹湯與刺身（刺身是一種生魚片日人名曰賽西米）吃刺身時，不可用筷亂抓魚身後面，把醬油一浸就吃。第三次爲燒魚，燒魚有整個的，也有切片的，若是整個的肉，可用筷取去中間的魚骨再吃。其次有煮物，添膳等，相繼而上，吃煮物時，切不可把鷄蛋豆腐，黏在碗邊。再次爲飯，宴會時的飯與吃正菜時的飯，稍有不同，宴會時的飯，到最後才送出來，有味噌湯（魚粉與醬葱煮成）與香物一併上來，待飯吃畢，再送茶與手巾上來，這時來賓依禮應當說一句「菜餚很好，吃得很飽，多謝多謝。</p>
<p>（三）一品菜的吃法　平常到了中流的朋友家中，欵待客人的簡單菜，其他普通的菜館也都備的，不過在菜館中所做的一品菜，大都隨隨便便，很不可口。本埠吳淞路北四川路一帶的東洋小菜館（御料理）都是寳這種菜例如（一）「司克耶克」用牛肉雞肉，青菜豆腐冬筍·大葱醬油，糖等混在一起，（也有應季節而不同的，大概以牛肉雞肉爲主）臨時在桌上隨燒隨吃，而且不分各人共同在一個鍋内，隨意吃的，吃時先在鍋内用筷取出燒熟的菜，在生雞蛋内一浸（二）動蒲利日入稱曰井，是大碗的飯菜，有各式各樣的菜與飯混在一起，如生魚，雞肉，蛤，山芋，蝦，胡麻，海苔以及其他種種，亦依季節而異）與我國的百寳飯樣式相類。（三）司西，是大皿中乘有魚肉菜蔬拌飯醬醋等東西，吃時應該在大皿中分到小皿，如嫌味淡，可在醬油碟中先浸再吃。</p>
<p>（四）辨當的配合　辨當是日本人出門工作，或入校上課時所備的便飯，盛在鎳製的盒或木片製的盒内。其配合的飯菜，式樣很多，有混合飯菜的，有分别飯菜的，依自己所好的食品，可以隨便配合。在日本各火車站都有現存配好的出售，因所配的材料不同，價目也有高低。</p>
<p>（五）正月的新年飯　新年到日本人家中去賀年，他們必先拿出福茶（茶）與點心（水果羹餅）吃茶時應把茶杯内的茶，以二口三口半吃盡，其次送上屠蘇酒，注屠蘇的酒杯，有三套，由小而大，（日本的酒杯，有一二三號，上面的爲一號，爲小杯，當中的爲中號，下面的爲大號）酒量大的人，儘可隨便飲，吃過屠蘇酒以後，爲羹湯，（用海苔煮的與鳥肉雜所煮的，）這羹湯可分在小碗吃，照規矩應當吃盡，不可殘留。</p>

<h3 id="c254">談風雅 <a href="#c254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— 陳田舍</p>
<p>某日某時，如厠忘帶書報，胡思亂想，由菊花而想到陶淵明，由陶淵明而想到清高，而想到風雅，於是，就談風雅。</p>
<p>風雅一事，談之唯易，行之唯艱。諸如一年不剪頭髮，六個月不洗澡，讀書孤入深山，題字攀登高峯，吃得下五碗飯仍得裝上三分病等等，非一般庸俗之徒所能應付。大約風雅的人，一定有獨特的個性。</p>
<p>中國本是古雅之邦，四時八節，都是雅事可找，「春遊芳草地，夏賞緑荷池，秋飯黄菊酒，冬吟白雪詩，」九月半的月亮，看上去不及八月半的明亮，賞亦無益，可是中秋去而重陽來，「登高」之舉，未必比「賞月」不風雅些吧！「孟嘉落帽」我們不能把它當逃難的故事看，因爲現在已有「租界」，爬山登高」，應列入雅事中去了。即使俗不可耐的傢伙，只要吹吹山風？就會脫胎換骨的。</p>
<p>一個風雅到爐火純清的人，他會在日陞樓踱方步。接到報喪條他就在上面寫起抒情詩來。就是再失四省國土，他亦淡然處之，因爲在風雅的圈子裏並没有救國，投軍，犧牲之類的事，所以「國家事」理合「管它娘」的。風雅君子所常到的地方，不外乎名山大川，茶坊酒肆，園林歌臺，風雅君子所常幹的事，不外乎賞月吟詩，踏雪探梅，飲酒品茗，等等，恕不詳舉。</p>
<p>在這所謂「詩般的秋天」裏，菊開蟹肥，少不得又要累他們「忙裏偷閒」幹一下「持螯賞菊」的雅事，談菊一定要談「東籬」，「九月團臍十月尖」更須背得爛熟。「清高」人的眼光當然亦是拔俗的。一雙蟹他們只認爲兩隻會箝人的螯是合得上「雅」的條件。假使你揑着蟹身體看菊花，或揑着蟹螯去賞月季，那就閙出絕大的不合邏輯的笑話，而不被駡爲庸夫俗子者幾希！</p>
<p>眞正風雅者，據說滿身没有一根俗骨，這當然要懂得生理學者來予以研究，不過那種從容瀟洒之態，確是難能可貴的。</p>

<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>「Evening　Post　Evening　Post」</p>
<p>像刮沙鍋那樣的聲音。</p>
<p>「五點半」在寫字房的大鐘上，在車夫的火車錶上，在買辦的「Cyma」上。</p>
<p>在柔和的黄色夕陽光下，在打寫字房裏衝下的人潮中，有着一顆瘦小腦袋，拉着枯澀的嗓子在嚷，濕潤的眼眶裏充溢着希望的視綫，把這視綫向穿西裝的，坐自備車的身上縛，給縛住的可很少啊，好多人盯一眼封面上的大題目便跑掉。</p>
<p>一些漂亮的年輕人儘站在大玻璃櫉前瞧廉價品。</p>
<p>夕陽爬上每件金屬品，射出無數針芒激刺着人們的淺薄的眼皮，鑽石戒，袖珍攝影機，J4K大號眞空自來水筆，秋季羊毛運動衫…瞧着，瞧着，許多人在淺薄的眼皮上織起物質虚榮的迷夢。</p>
<p>眼前的旱災和一九三六世界大戰的如何危急性，在他們是隔膜的。</p>
<p>可是，那髒得像癩皮狗模樣的孩子，挾着晚刋儘在大街上嚷，嚷，他和一切路人的心是隔膜的。</p>
<p>黄色的夕陽貼在咖啡店的白瓷磚牆上，粗粗細細的腿影在上面移動着，那樣紊亂又那樣怱忙，寫字房退出來的人便到這兒安息一回兒，「鮑賽利拿」帽盔和法蘭羢上裝由白衣侍者手裏掛上衣架，要一客晚茶，椰子蛋糕和巴西咖啡，把一天的疲倦呌給女職員的紅嘴兒吞了，異國少年色情底流露，咖啡那麽濃烈的。</p>
<p>可是，賣晚刋的，癩皮狗模樣的孩子嚷得更響啦，帶着顫慄，帶着愁苦味，「Evening　Post」</p>
<p>「鬼，惡鬼，吵不清的，滾開！」對面二層樓窗口有一個帶金絲眼鏡的怒臉。那賣晚刋的孩子立刻知道在趕自己跑，他常常受到那地産公司裏洋大板的威脅，他本能地低下腦袋，瞧着蓋在自己脚上的夕陽，他發現自己的脚在開始向没有陽光的横街上移動了。</p>
<p>寫字房裏的人走空了，只有繪着風景畫的大掛曆，打字機，沙漏瓶架，鋼鑄文具箱…伴陪着傍晚的寂寥。</p>
<p>大街上，靜悄悄地，新流綫式汽車甲壳蟲似的爬過去，没聲没響地。咖啡店出來的是幽嫻的步子，飄着銀絲綢裙角，飄着褐色領帶。洋兵，二三個，五六個，走了一陣又來一陣，揮着皮鞭兒，「哩啦哩啦」没結没完的哼着，夕陽在他們皮鞭底下給踏得糢糊而灰淡了。</p>
<p>賣晚刋的孩子又闖到大街上來，「Evening　Post……」嚷着，嚷着，站在街角化石似的，失去了靈感的人呵，他的生命是糢糊的，灰淡的。</p>
<h3 id="c256">秋天没父親的孩子身上 <a href="#c256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— 不揚</p>
<p>秋是整個地落在没父親的孩子身上。</p>
<p>灰色的遭遇，灰色的衣服，灰色的心靈，一切都浸在灰色的染缸裏。</p>
<p>陰霾的面上老讓淚水潤濕着，像秋雨時的天空。</p>
<p>是一個充滿着憂鬱的季節裏的憂鬱的人兒呵！</p>
<p>三月前的他還是個極有朝氣的青年，他幸福地活着，輕快地消磨無憂的歲月，他對着一事一物都發生興趣。在他整部（廿一年）的人生史上是找不到秋天的，雖只他也有穿秋季衫的時候。</p>
<p>他厭惡秋天像厭惡多愁善病的女人一樣，不可捉摸的陰晴是可以用女人來測騐的！</p>
<p>可是在一氣趕完五百里路的那天，在父親踏進另一世界的那天，他喪失從前享受過的全部幸福；連這僅有的自傲也同歸於盡。</p>
<p>從那天起，他開始一步步地和從前厭惡過的季節接觸。</p>
<p>那不是出於自願，是一種失怙的悲哀在强制執行着。</p>
<p>於是春風似的面上像孕婦似地蒙上一層陰霾的紗罩，本來輕易找不到的淚珠，現在是和秋夜的露水一樣，隨處都可以見到。</p>
<p>靠在當窗的半桌上，兩手撑着下巴，翻起水淋淋的眼睛望望天：天灰沉沉的，正落着淚珠似的細雨。也許在同情他吧！這樣想着他的心頭感到一絲安慰。</p>
<p>秋是適宜於共患難的，他承認着。</p>
<p>於是曾經表示厭惡過和强制執行過的秋，現在覺着好感了。他覺着自己是應該在蕭瑟的落葉裏和凄凉的蟬聲裏討生活，他覺着自己是應該在秋風秋雨中謀出路。</p>
<p>這是他親自體騐出來的見解，他慶幸自己能够得着一個可以訴苦的愛侣，有深夜裏，在孤寂中。</p>
<p>就是這樣不自禁地和多愁善病的女人訂了婚。</p>
<p>就是這樣不自覺地秋的原素通過了他的全身。</p>

<h3 id="c257">草場上 <a href="#c257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— 幼翰</p>
<p>草塲上一切都在動，牛尾巴搖得加倍起勁，蚊子結羣地在空中飛舞：傍晚了。</p>
<p>小和像一隻狗，在塲上打滾；身子是那麽輕，一氣滾過了半個草塲，頭才覺得有些暈，翻個身，站了起來，把眼睛睃過四周，提高嗓子，怪尖銳地喊：</p>
<p>「肏娘的，小拇」！</p>
<p>名呌小拇的那隻牛聽了，慌張地去掉嘴裏的芥菜花，從菜園裏，逃命似的，曳着尾，跑了出來。</p>
<p>小和趕過去，擒過小拇的鼻環，狠狠地向牛肚上送了一鞭，牛忍着痛，把身上轉了幾度，四脚輕輕動一動，吐出一聲乞憐的「唔！」。</p>
<p>小和通了氣，放去牛鼻環；伸直兩臂，正好和牛背平高，只一按，跨上牛背。</p>
<p>牛繼續俯下頭嚙草；小和垂着四肢，仰臥牛背上，口裏哼着紅蓮歌，眼釘在傍晚乾凈的天空，心裏頭想道：「阿英要求了」…</p>
<p>暮色和晚風一齊加添了些。</p>
<p>「小和！小和！」阿英終於來了；小和心裏只一跳，從牛背上滑下草地。</p>
<p>那邊，梧桐樹下，阿英站在那裏招手：「這邊來，小和」。</p>
<p>「你這邊來」小和蹲在草地上笑；不過去。</p>
<p>「不要要啦！快過來，有話對你說」是急促的聲音，臉有些發紅，没有笑。</p>
<p>看看阿英眞的不在要，小和心裏重重地又一跳；再没有遲疑，迎着風，奔了過去。</p>
<p>兩雙手握起來時，没有像往日一樣的四個笑靨同時露出；小和没等到坐下便慌張地問：</p>
<p>「什麽事，快告訴我！」</p>
<p>掘起嘴，縐了眉頭，同答是：「爸爸要把我賣了」</p>
<p>「賣了？！」小和半信半不信。</p>
<p>「是！」</p>
<p>「眞的？你怎麽知道？」</p>
<p>「媽媽告訴我的」嘴掘得更利害「她說爸爸欠了城裏薛爺的錢，不能够還；昨天薛爺又呌人到家裏討債，爸没法，只好答應把我送他做丫頭，當做還錢」。</p>
<p>不錯，小和這才明白了。昨天他趕牛打阿英家門前經過時，他看見一個城裏人在搥她家裏的棹，雷響似的駡着，阿英爸站在一旁抖戰。</p>
<p>「哦！」他發楞了，眼前的東西，他都看不見，「什麽時候去呢？」他問；但心裏總以爲阿英至少還可以同他再玩幾天。</p>
<p>「明天一早，爸就要帶我走。」</p>
<p>「就是明天？」他問得那麽大聲，有些像喊。「明天！」這是多麽酸的呀！酸得兩顆幼嫩的心再也當不住了，於是，粒粒圓圓的淚珠，從赤紅的小頰面上，滾落，滾落。</p>
<p>許久，沈默着；風捲着他們的頭髮。</p>
<p>驀地，一個希望掠過小和的腦中，跟着心頭一下熱，他猛然問：</p>
<p>「你能够逃回來嗎？」</p>
<p>被這個突然的一問，她遲疑了少刻。許多孩子所能够想想的困難都顯在她眼前，終於，搖搖頭，應：</p>
<p>「不能，我不曉得路！」</p>
<p>「那麽！」小和想到路；路！那是多麽遠呀！他把話止了。</p>
<p>「什麽？」她緊追着問，熱望地問。</p>

<p>— 小林</p>
<p>夜的都會像一個放蕩的賣淫婦，半裸着肉體，無恥地向着人們投擲誘惑的笑，挑送的笑。許多人就這樣神經病似的，發了瘋一樣地，把整個的靈魂和身心埋葬到那荒邪的迷魂陣中。</p>
<p>用黄金換買虚僞的歡情，換買時間的沉醉，沉醉的高速度的振盪裏邊，没有思想變成了一種亦感覺性的機械物，離不了物質慾的官能享受。此外一切都不存在於眼底，連自己。</p>
<p>都會的夜是人慾混合金錢力的無邊的交流。在舞塲裏，在暗紅的燈光下，世界頓然縮少到只有你和我那般大小。金子開花，肉慾濫泛。把生命看得鵝毛那麽輕，雲朶那麽飄渺！好像一錯過了今日就没有明日似的。於是罪孽當作正經，送自己入地獄，儘情浪費生命，淫蕩地消磨過日子。這些出入於花花緑緑的塲所的人們，大抵都是人與人間的累贅，或是零餘者。只有軀殼而無靈魂的僵屍。吃遺産過生活，生活的内容是醜穢的，糜爛的，對自己就是等於慢性自殺，對於人則無形造了許爲罪惡。</p>
<p>不知道日，也不知道夜，糊里糊塗地混過一生，日常生活脫不了豪奢的物質供應，所以他們是物質的奴隸，物質的俘虜，壓根兒没有精神上的養息。然而他們却算是社會上層的人物，踏在人們的腦袋上，卑劣地偷生。他們的生存。雖不能否認，但是毫無價值，遠不如一個胼手胝足出氣力吃自己氣力的，所謂下流人那種人生的莊重。</p>

<h3 id="e9">Salt Worker Representatives from Twelve Weirs Petition the Province, Requesting the Preservation of Sail Transport and Three Other Matters, Failing to Get Results, Bivouacking in Front of the Provincial Government <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Yangzhou Entire City Strikes for a Day</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) The salt workers from Twelve Weirs petitioned because the transport by sail has not been implemented, and the three measures determined by Commissioner Miao, namely, setting up hemp bag factories, immigrating people to work, and subsidizing boats for changing professions, are about to be implemented. The livelihoods of over 200,000 people are about to be cut off, so they have specially sent over 4,000 representatives to the province to petition. The first batch of over 2,000 arrived at noon on the 17th and gathered outside the government. The chief representative Zhu Zhaoliu and others went inside to request a meeting with Chairman Chen. Chen went to Nanjing on official business, so Section Chief Wan met with them on his behalf. The representatives requested that three matters be conveyed to the central government: (1) Abolish Commissioner Miao's three measures; (2) Preserve sail transport; (3) Withdraw the order for the Seven Companies to move north. Wan promised to convey it after Chairman Chen returns. The representatives, failing to get results, stood waiting and did not disperse. At night, they all bivouacked in the wind and dew. Over 1,000 more people arrived on the 18th. All circles in Yangzhou have repeatedly appealed regarding the issue of the Seven Companies, but it has not been resolved. Commissioner Miao came to Yangzhou on the 16th, and all circles petitioned three times, but there were no results and they were oppressed by the tax police, which aroused public outrage. Starting on the morning of the 17th, the entire city went on strike, with schools and businesses closed, vehicles stopped, and transportation cut off. The masses also held meetings and demonstrations. Seeing the aroused public sentiment, Miao visited Wang Boling and discussed for three hours, deciding on three measures: (1) The relocation of the Seven Companies to the north can be temporarily suspended, but the reorganization measures determined by the office must be followed. This matter will be submitted to the ministry for review and decision. (2) Regarding the sail transport of salt from the weirs, it is proposed to submit it to the ministry to convene all relevant parties to discuss it together, with the aim of obtaining a thorough solution. (3) The additional salt tax and public welfare donations will be kept in the custody and supervision of fair people from the local area, and Miao will personally meet with the representatives to explain everything. Transportation was restored in the afternoon, and all businesses opened on the 18th. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Yangzhou) Commissioner Miao dispatched tax police on the evening of the 16th to drive away the petitioning representatives, which triggered the strike of businesses and schools on the 17th, cutting off transportation. (17th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e10">Washington Considers Sino-U.S. Exchange of Gold and Silver <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Expresses Approval of Our Country's Proposal</p>
<p>Believes This Move Will Benefit Both Parties</p>
<p>(Washington) On the 14th of this month, the Chinese government sent a note to the United States stating that it wanted to ascertain whether the United States government, in principle, was willing to engage in a mutual exchange of gold and silver with the Chinese government. The State Department has recently announced that the United States government believes that this proposal from the Chinese government is sufficient to facilitate the United States' silver policy, and that the adverse effects of the United States' purchase of silver on the Chinese economy can thus be avoided. (16th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to the documents exchanged between China and the United States that were released today, China is now planning to gradually adopt the gold standard. The State Department stated when releasing these documents that the authorities are currently studying whether it is possible to directly exchange American gold for Chinese silver so that the United States' silver purchase policy can proceed and the Chinese economy can not be adversely affected. The Chinese government's communication stated that the gradual adoption of the gold standard requires the collection of gold bars and that the United States government wants to increase its holdings of silver for monetary purposes. The Chinese government also wants to ascertain in principle whether the United States government is willing to exchange gold for silver. Viewing this, the meaning of a section of the reply issued by the Premier two days ago can be further clarified. The reply said, "The free market for gold and silver is still open to purchasers, and all countries can participate. Therefore, there has not been a direct transaction between governments. The use of this market in the future can be discussed in a friendly manner because we all want to work towards a common standard. We will be happy to meet with your representative at any time to study this greater possibility." U.S. authorities have frequently stated over the past year that their policy is to distribute the world's gold evenly among all countries. If the proposal to exchange American gold for Chinese silver is realized, then this exchange should help the United States implement its policy. The main point of the Chinese communication is that the U.S. purchase of silver has led to rising silver prices, which is detrimental to China because foreigners who purchase Chinese goods will feel that the prices are higher and that China's silver reserves will flow out due to U.S. purchases. The American reply acknowledges this point. The United States still needs to purchase silver, so Washington, like China, does not want silver prices to be too high. Economists expressed their opinions today, saying that the direct exchange of U.S. gold and Chinese silver could be an effective way to obtain silver on the one hand and avoid high silver prices on the other.

<h3 id="e11">After Our Silver Note is Sent Out, American Newspapers Express Sympathy and Criticize the American Silver Policy as Inappropriate <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to diplomatic circles, the Washington telegram on the 16th reported that after our country's silver note was sent out, most of the major American newspapers gave it good criticism and criticized the American silver policy as inappropriate. The main ones are translated and recorded below: (1) The New York Times editorial stated that the Chinese silver note was worded mildly, but it had provided an effective answer to one of the issues in the U.S. silver dispute, namely that raising silver prices is unfavorable to China. The Chinese government has confirmed the direct and unfortunate impact of the U.S. silver policy on China. Statistical materials fully prove that China's statement is not false. The result of raising silver prices is only to lower prices and frustrate China's purchasing power for foreign goods. It must be known that reducing trade and shrinking currency prices cannot be called prosperity. Because silver prices have increased, China has levied a silver export tax as protection. Judging from China's current protests, those who advocate raising silver prices do not need to claim that what they have done is helpful to China. (2) The New York Tribune editorial stated that China's levy of a silver export tax is the only reasonable measure that China can take to prevent its silver reserves from being absorbed in large quantities by the United States for monetary purposes. It is unknown whether Washington has realized the possible repercussions of the American silver policy on international trade stability. In fact, China has left the silver standard. China may be able to follow Keynes' advice and abandon the silver standard, but it is very difficult for China to take this path. Otherwise, the second step is to lower the value of silver coins. If so, Japan will inevitably lower the value of the yen. If the value of the yen is lowered, the pound sterling will also follow, and then Britain will be able to compete with Japan in commerce. This is sufficient to prove that the currency dispute will not be limited to a universal scale. (3) The Washington Post editorial stated that after Chinese Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi issued a statement, we can no longer imagine that the American silver policy has any benefits for the East. Mr. 毛来氏 may now have to give up his attitude towards the Chinese government, which is based on the opposition of a small number of Chinese people. On the contrary, the Chinese can imitate Mao's words and say that the attitude of the American government is spoiled by the opinions of a small number of Americans. The only way to increase purchasing power is to increase real income on goods. This kind of work cannot be spared by manipulating currency because it is not enough to treat but is enough to increase the chronic diseases of the economy. (4) The Baltimore Sun editorial stated that the American silver policy is meaningless. Its real purpose is not to devalue the dollar, but to help mine operators. Those who support the silver policy, saying that it is beneficial to silver standard countries, have not taken into account the possible consequences for China's domestic finances. The American purchase of silver affects the decline of China's currency, thus limiting China's purchasing power. Before China's silver reserves are exhausted, American exporters can profit, but its direct impact is that China's domestic businesses are harmed, and eventually China's ability to purchase American goods in the future is reduced. Hull firmly knows that the American recklessness on silver is detrimental to the Chinese economy. (17th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e12">Chinese Currency Devaluation May Trigger a Universal Currency War <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) The Associated Press learned today from senior authorities that the government is now studying the possibility that various countries will take retaliatory measures against the American currency policy. China's levy of a silver export tax is actually no different from banning silver exports. The result is still difficult to predict. However, the Treasury Department's silver purchase plan will at least continue as before for the time being. Some experts believe that the export tax has now become China's weapon, so silver prices have soared to the highest level in five years in recent days. Some experts believe that China's levy of an export tax is actually equivalent to reducing the value of the Chinese currency and is another step towards universal devaluation, so it is very likely to trigger a universal currency war. If China can use the method of continuing to increase taxes to make it unprofitable to export silver, thus restricting the export of silver and preventing domestic currency contraction, then the world may see another wave of currency devaluation. After the Chinese currency is devalued, trade with Japan may be beneficial, but the Japanese government may reduce the value of the Japanese yen as a result, and other countries will also follow suit. However, experts here believe that China does not issue many banknotes, so it may be difficult to reduce the silver content in silver coins. (16th National Telegram)</p>

<p>(London) The Financial News recently published an article discussing China's currency policy across the board and issuing an unexpected prediction, saying that China will join the sterling bloc. It said, "After China abandons the silver standard, what must be decided immediately is what kind of standard system to adopt in international trade. In other words, what standard system will the recently established exchange rate equalization fund be based on? Gold? The dollar? The pound? We believe that it is credible that China will use the pound as its standard, and the sterling bloc will also welcome an important member to join the group. Although China's monetary situation will still be in an abnormal state for some time, because China has a large number of silver ingots, and using silver ingots as a medium for international trade will be more valuable than silver dollars, it will inevitably be used to offset import surpluses. In this way, China's change of standard will be decided on the following two issues: (1) Can Chinese officials ban silver smuggling? (2) Can the silver currency notes currently in circulation in China be quickly withdrawn and replaced with gold currency notes? (17th Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>— Heng</p>
<p>丨France's Future Diplomacy丨</p>
<p>Since this summer, there have not only been many events in European countries, but also the deaths of their political figures have been more frequent than usual. Among them, people such as Hindenburg died of old age, and Dollfuss, Alexander, and Barthou all died by assassination. The world has been shocked by the deaths of these people, fearing that the international situation may change dramatically as a result. Unexpectedly, a European telegram reported that the old French politician Poincaré had also passed away. How can the world not be filled with sorrow and feel that France, as the center of the European situation, has lost two major political figures in one week, making people lament endlessly.</p>
<p>Poincaré served as the President of France for seven years (1912-1920), but he was not as well-known to the world as when he was the Prime Minister, especially when he concurrently served as the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The President of France is a position of honor, and in reality, the political issues of great importance are handled by the Prime Minister. Therefore, once elected as President, their name often cannot be seen in the newspapers every day. As is the case with Doumergue today, he once served as President (1920-1927), but few know it. Now that he is the Prime Minister, more people know him. This is because one wields real power and the other holds a nominal position. However, the name of the Prime Minister is sometimes far less dazzling than that of the Foreign Minister. Because in this time of international turmoil, if its Foreign Minister has talent, he will undoubtedly be able to establish extraordinary achievements with superior skills. Internally, he receives praise from the people, and externally, he receives respect from other countries. The late Briand and the recent Barthou had both served as Prime Minister many times, but their fame in the world was during their time as Foreign Minister. The facts are obvious. Poincaré's fame also lies in his concurrent position as Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, not in his position as President of France.</p>
<p>Since the Great War, there have been three people in France whose diplomatic achievements shook the world: one is Poincaré, the second is Briand, and the third is Barthou. Poincaré's diplomacy was uncompromising towards Germany. The treaty must be fulfilled, and reparations must be paid. Although it was difficult to cope with the lack of cooperation from Britain at the time, he still did not hesitate to use force to pressure Germany and send troops to occupy the Ruhr. Other notable aspects of his policy towards Germany included the prolonged failure to withdraw troops from the Rhineland and the refusal to reduce the amount of reparations. Therefore, Poincaré's diplomacy is the most rigid type of French diplomacy. As for Briand's diplomacy, the world knows that it was diplomacy of cooperation and harmony. The conclusion of the Locarno Treaty, Germany's joining the League of Nations, the establishment of the Non-Aggression Pact, and the reduction of German reparations are all major diplomatic achievements. The most recent Barthou was a diplomatic master of both alliance and division. His purpose was to ally with many countries to isolate Germany. Examples include strengthening the alliance of the Little Entente, promoting the unity of the Balkans, creating a Franco-Russian alliance, eliminating Anglo-French suspicions, and dispelling Franco-Italian suspicions. These are all his great successes. This type of diplomacy can be called group diplomacy or alliance diplomacy. In short, although the diplomatic styles of these three people seem to be different, their main purpose is the same. Poincaré's intention was to prevent Germany from rising again to cause trouble for France. Briand's main purpose was to eliminate the hatred of the Germans and restore them to friendship in order to seek understanding between the two countries. Barthou's intention was to build more friendly nations to reduce German assistance. Therefore, in a word, the efforts of the three were all to seek security for France, but their methods were slightly different.</p>
<p>Now Barthou is gone, and his position as Foreign Minister has been succeeded by Laval. Poincaré is gone, and his person is only left in the imagination of French political history. Will France's diplomacy continue as before or will it open up a new path? This is a question that deserves attention. However, based on a general observation of French diplomacy over the past ten years, its fundamental point is always security, and its methods are no more than these three paths: rigidity, cooperation, and alliance. Moreover, the diplomatic policies of the various parties in France are largely the same, so the political tides in the past were all about internal affairs, and political tides rarely occurred due to diplomacy. And in times of national difficulty, the direction of diplomacy must be determined and unwavering. Therefore, changes in people will not have much impact. If there is any, it will only be in the difference in skills and not in other areas. This is what we can imagine and obtain.</p>

<p>Hungarian Man Shot Dead by Yugoslavian Border Guards, Public Outrage Ensues</p>
<p>France and Yugoslavia Share Hardships, Friendship Strengthens Over Time</p>
<p>Before the Remote Causes of the Marseille Incident Are Clarified</p>
<p>Yugoslavia Temporarily Refrains From Diplomatic Action</p>
<p>Budapest: Yesterday, a Hungarian man named Kolake was shot dead by Yugoslavian guards when crossing the Yugoslavian border. Upon hearing this news, public outrage has erupted. Earlier this year, Hungary and Yugoslavia had a dispute over border issues, which was brought before the League of Nations. There are concerns that a similar dispute will occur again. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Belgrade: Since the Marseille assassination, the government has not yet decided what diplomatic actions it will take regarding this case. This is the opinion of responsible figures in Yugoslavia. They believe that a decision can only be made after the investigation is clear and the remote and immediate causes of the assassination are understood. Therefore, as of now, no preparations have been made for any kind of negotiations, whether with Hungary or Geneva. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Belgrade: A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared to our reporter that France and Yugoslavia are allied countries, sharing hardships together, and their friendship grows stronger over time. Now that the French President has come to this country, the people of Yugoslavia will treat him as a close friend. "The friendship between France and Yugoslavia will never be broken. The arrival of the French head of state will only make the relations between the two countries even closer." The spokesman's statement can represent the unanimous opinion of all sectors of Yugoslavia, that is, both France and Yugoslavia have been harmed by the Marseille tragedy. The friendship between France and Yugoslavia has become stronger since the European War. During the Battle of Salonika, French and Yugoslav soldiers fought side by side, their blood staining the battlefield. (Note: During the European War, after Bulgaria joined the German-Austrian alliance, Serbia was attacked from both sides, and the Serbian army retreated into Albania. Later, British and French troops landed in Salonika, Greece, and the Serbian army joined them in combat.) The people of both countries will never forget this. Now, another tragedy has occurred, causing the leaders of both countries to suffer untimely deaths. The friendship between the two countries will become even closer as a result. (Havas, 16th)</p>

<p>French President and Romanian King Arrive in Capital to Pay Respects</p>
<p>Hitler Sends Goering to Attend the Funeral</p>
<p>Belgrade: Since Tuesday morning, countless people have been flocking to pay their respects to the late King Alexander. The place where the coffin rests is surrounded by white chrysanthemums, creating a somber atmosphere. The dim candlelight further enhances the sense of sorrow. Black tassels hang low around the coffin, behind which is a large white cross, below which is placed the crown, still shining brightly. Many of the mourners, both women and men, have been waiting for so long that they are unable to stand it any longer. Representatives of the German minority in the country have also presented four wreaths. The King's funeral is scheduled for tomorrow, with representatives from twenty-seven countries participating. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>Belgrade: Former Prime Minister of Yugoslavia and leader of the Croatian People's Party, Dr. Kraulischetz, who was the most vehement opponent of King Alexander, will also come here to attend the funeral. People in Yugoslavia are greatly moved by this. Dr. Kraulischetz also issued a declaration in Spalato last Sunday, renouncing his opposition policy forever, which shows that his words are sincere. The late King's other political enemies, Dr. Spaco and Dr. Krasnicai, will also come here, which is also seen as a sign of abandoning old grudges. It is noted that the two men are leaders of Yugoslav Muslims. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>Belgrade: French President Lebrun arrived here at 8:30 this morning. The Yugoslav Regent, members of the government, and personnel from the French embassy all went to the station to greet him.

Goering will fly to the capital of Yugoslavia tomorrow morning, accompanied by Lieutenant General Braschkowitz and Navy Captain Baron Holtzdorf. The government also issued a statement tonight regarding this matter, stating that the German leader wanted to show the German military's respect for the late King of Yugoslavia, and therefore sent his most trusted person as a special envoy. Goering will present a wreath at the tomb of the late King in the Yugoslav capital, with the inscription: "The German military respectfully offers this with deep sorrow at the tomb of a former valiant enemy."

<h3 id="e20">Origins of Marseille Assassination Suspects Ascertained <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Kalman Is Actually Joseph's Alias</p>
<p>Committed the Crime After Being Granted Amnesty, Joined Terrorist Group</p>
<p>Sofia: The real name of Kalman, the assassin of the King of Yugoslavia, is Joseph, also known as Chernozemsky, nicknamed "Driver" Prahda. He is a well-known Macedonian terrorist, whose identity has been confirmed by the Yugoslav police. It has now been proven without a doubt that the fingerprints of Kalman sent by the French police have been compared with the fingerprints of Joseph and are indeed consistent. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Belgrade: The Minister of the Interior has recently received a report proving the name and origin of the assassin of the late King Alexander. The tattoo on the left arm of the assassin Kalman, the scars on his abdomen, and the fingerprints left by the police in Sofia in 1931, all prove that the criminal Kalman is indeed Joseph, also known as Chernozemsky, a member of the Macedonian rights terrorist party. This person left the capital of Yugoslavia in 1932 and went to the capital of Hungary, where he stayed and served the party. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>(Paris): The National Investigation Team has recently obtained new information regarding the origins of the assassin Joseph, also known as Kalman. It has been learned that Joseph was born in 1897 in the Macedonian region belonging to Serbia. At the age of fourteen, he followed his mother to Bulgaria and worked as a car driver. He then changed his profession to transportation and joined the Bulgarian "Olymp" revolutionary organization. In 1924, he assassinated parliamentarians Demov and Domarewski. He was later arrested and sentenced to death. In 1932, he was granted amnesty and left Bulgaria to join the Yugoslav Croatian terrorist organization (organized by parliamentarian Pavletic). (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Captured Criminal Confesses Accomplices: Melun, France: The small police station in Melun, 28 miles southeast of Paris, was visited today by a Yugoslav police chief to examine Marni, (also known as Cherny), the suspect in the Marseille assassination who was arrested there yesterday. He confirmed that the man was his former driver. The criminal confessed that his real name was Kraguy, born in Yugoslavia in 1908. He was ordered to assassinate King Alexander of Yugoslavia. He was indeed next to Kalman on the day of the crime, but he did not participate because he was afraid. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>Three of Seven Fugitives: Melun, France: After Marni was arrested, he was questioned by Simonovic, the head of the investigation team from the capital of Yugoslavia, from 6 p.m. until 1:30 a.m. Marni has confessed to participating in the conspiracy. His nickname among the party members is "Cherny," meaning "strongman." He was ordered to strike in Paris or Marseille when the opportunity arose. So far, there seem to be a total of seven accomplices to the assassin. In addition to the main assassin Joseph (also known as Kalman) who was killed on the spot, Novak (also known as Pospisil) and Penes (also known as Reichlick) have been imprisoned, and Marni has also been arrested. The remaining fugitives are the beautiful woman Utrov and two other men. It is estimated that the leader of the party is among the two men who have not yet been captured. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Mysterious Woman Missing: Marseille: The police here recently conducted an inspection of the hotel in Aix where Marni and the beautiful woman Utrov were staying. As a result, two bombs and a pistol were found in Marni's room. These bombs were identical to those found on the main assassin Joseph (also known as Kalman), which shows that Marni's participation in the conspiracy is confirmed. As for the beautiful woman Utrov, her whereabouts are still unknown. (Havas, 16th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo): Representatives of various countries for disarmament have arrived in London, and the naval preparatory conference will open soon. The following statement was issued on the 16th, declaring Japan's beliefs: (1) Establishment of the right to national self-defense. Each country has the inherent right to maintain sufficient military strength to ensure its national defense. Japan has the inherent right to maintain sufficient military strength to ensure its national defense, and it is a necessary obligation to ensure peace in the Far East. (2) Achievement of substantial disarmament. Japan advocates for the reduction of armaments, not the expansion of armaments. In other words, based on the spirit of disarmament, we will do our best to reduce the armaments of various countries in order to reduce the burden on the people and promote friendly relations between countries. (3) Reduction of offensive weapons. Various countries should completely abolish offensive weapons in order to establish the principle of non-aggression. In accordance with the principle of strengthening defensive weapons, we will implement the reduction of armaments. (4) Abolition of the Washington Treaty and conclusion of a new treaty. Japan will abolish the Washington Treaty and hopes to conclude a fair and appropriate treaty to replace the old treaty. (5) Measures in case the treaty is not concluded. If an agreement cannot be reached, Japan will take measures to properly handle its national defense. However, Japan is determined to conduct negotiations in a peaceful manner from beginning to end, and strive to avoid the deterioration of international peace. (United Press, 17th)</p>
<p>(London): Japanese representative to the London Naval Preparatory Talks, Rear Admiral Yamamoto, arrived in Southampton at 4:30 p.m. today. British and Japanese officials welcomed him at the port. The British Minister of the Navy was represented by Admiral Jackson. After a short rest, Yamamoto boarded a train to London, arriving here at 7:40 p.m. Ambassador Matsudaira and personnel from the Japanese embassy, as well as leaders of the British government, greeted him at the station. Yamamoto told foreign reporters today that Japan will do its best to make the naval conference a success. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(London): Regarding the naval conference preparatory talks, although the British side has announced that it plans to hold separate talks between the two countries, it is generally believed that it would be better for the representatives of the UK, US, and Japan to hold joint talks immediately. Those around US Chief Representative Davis do not conceal this view. However, in terms of due process, the US side believes that since the naval talks were initiated at the invitation of the UK, it is appropriate to follow the methods decided by the UK. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>(Moscow): Izvestia commented on the preliminary naval talks to be held in London, saying, "On the one hand, Japan has declared that it wants to abolish the Washington Treaty, and on the other hand, the United States has declared that it wants to maintain the Washington and London Agreements. These two demonstrative and conflicting declarations reaffirm the fact that the second preliminary naval talks, in terms of whether they can conclude any specific agreement, will open under extremely unfavorable conditions. Behind the issues of submarines and aircraft carriers lies a fundamental modern issue, namely the general relationship between the navies of Japan and the UK and the US. "The political significance of Japan's demands is to conclude a special treaty with the United States, creating a situation that forces the United States to give up its influence in Asian affairs. This has angered the United States, which is unwilling to abandon its plans to gain influence in China and other Asian countries. Therefore, it is also in a similar state of conflict. It is easy for us to see that whether the London talks have a chance of success is even more questionable." (TASS, 16th)</p>
<p>(London): A faction of the Conservative Party not only looks down on the initial naval talks, but also does not value the naval conference itself. These people fear that the British government may endanger national security by making concessions during the preliminary talks and the formal conference. Among them, the Morning Post stated that some cabinet members are deeply afraid that Prime Minister MacDonald is paying too much attention to the issue of rapprochement between Japan and the United States, and is willing to make concessions to the United States. It should be firmly stated that the British navy is inferior due to existing treaty relations, which Britain cannot tolerate for long. The Daily Mail, on the other hand, used sarcastic language, saying that the naval talks are precarious, and that what is currently being discussed are issues such as the limitation of total tonnage, the maximum tonnage of battleships, and the deployment of naval forces. It is hoped that the next war will make it clear to people that the ratio system, which experts pay so much attention to, is not reliable in modern warfare, because the power of submarines and aircraft can invalidate the ratio system. Experts do not seem to have seen the birth of submarines and aircraft. (Havas, 17th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo): On the 17th, at the cabinet meeting, regarding the issue of reforming the organization stationed in Manchuria, the government decided to clarify its attitude and issue a statement in the name of the Chief Cabinet Secretary. The statement reads as follows: In order to adjust the organizations related to Manchuria, a case was decided at the cabinet meeting on the 14th of this month, and preparations are being made to proceed in accordance with this resolution. In the 16th and 17th cabinet meetings, we considered how to handle the actual situation and other related matters. The government will handle the matter in accordance with the policy that has been decided, and will remain consistent and will not change. In the future, it will be necessary to promote the necessary laws and regulations in order to establish the adjustment of organizations related to Manchuria. Recently, it has been heard that there are concerns that this plan will turn the police into gendarmerie. It is not known that this method was originally intended to unify the command system, and it is by no means intended to turn the police into gendarmerie. Therefore, there should be no misunderstanding or anxiety about this point.

<p>(Tokyo): Based on the decision made at the cabinet meeting on the 17th, regarding the issue of concurrent appointments, the government respects the position of the Kwantung side and issued the following legalization policy: (1) The new organization's police department will have four sections: police affairs, security, higher education, and health. (2) Among them, the security department is directly related to military affairs because it maintains law and order and suppresses bandits. Therefore, a military officer should be appointed as the head of the section, and some soldiers should also be added to its staff. (3) Among the higher education staff, in order to maintain contact in terms of the nature of the affairs, a gendarmerie officer of the rank of lieutenant should also be added. (4) The person in charge of personnel administration for police officers is the police affairs section, and its section chief should be appointed by a civilian official with the rank of imperial appointment, placing him above the heads of the various sections. No soldiers may be added to the police affairs section or the health section. (United Press, 17th)</p>

Today, the General Affairs Office continued to receive proposals from the construction departments of various provinces, which have been included in the agenda. (Seventeenth dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Li Yizhi, Chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, stated that he went to Suiyuan, Gansu, Ningxia, and other places in mid-September to investigate and study water conservancy and navigation on the upper reaches of the Yellow River. Navigation has now been opened from Ningxia to Baotou, but the river surface varies in width, with some narrow sections only twenty or thirty meters wide and rapid currents, making dredging difficult. Shanxi province built small-wheeled boats with a draft of two feet to travel back and forth, which can only carry ordinary passengers and cargo to maintain transportation. The Yunting Canal in Ningxia province and the Minsheng Canal in Suiyuan province have greatly benefited agricultural water conservancy. This time, a fundamental plan for canal water conservancy is needed, so a meeting in Tianjin is necessary. (Seventeenth dispatch)</p>

<p>Xi'an, 16th—Chairman Chiang delivered an address during the expanded memorial week for all circles on the 15th, titled "Thoughts on a Tour of Shaanxi and Hopes for Shaanxi." The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman Shao, Director Yang, fellow comrades, today I, your brother, have come to Xi'an to participate in this expanded memorial week, which is a truly rare opportunity. Therefore, I feel very happy and honored. Now, I would like to take this opportunity to share my personal thoughts after visiting Shaanxi and my hopes for all comrades and fellow citizens in Shaanxi. As everyone knows, Shaanxi Province, especially Chang'an, is the birthplace of Chinese culture and can also be said to be the cradle of the Chinese nation. Since Emperor Huangdi founded the nation, from the Zhou Dynasty through the Qin, Han, and Tang Dynasties, Chang'an has been the capital of China. During this era, the Chinese nation, in terms of both military prowess and culture, continuously developed and reached its peak from here. Therefore, not only should the people who live in this place recognize the glory and greatness of this national history and resolutely take on the great task of national rejuvenation as their own responsibility, but also visitors from afar, if they are citizens of the Republic of China, descendants of Emperor Huangdi, and members of the Chinese nation, cannot help but feel deep historical emotions and be inspired. Seeing such beautiful rivers and mountains and the many historical sites of past dynasties, and recalling the great achievements of our ancestors in building the country and developing the nation, one can understand that our Chinese nation has the greatest creative ability and the most brilliant civilized history. At the same time, recalling the current critical situation of our country's survival, one cannot help but feel overwhelmed by the contrast between the past and the present. Look at how great our ancestors were, and how glorious our history was. But now, internal and external troubles come one after another, and the country is in a dangerous state of survival. Not only are we unable to keep pace with other countries and survive independently in the world, but we cannot even achieve the status of a third-rate country. Instead, we are about to be ranked as a semi-colonial territory and face the danger of being destroyed at any time. What a shame! What a sorrow! But we are all descendants of the wise emperors and divine ancestors of past dynasties since Emperor Huangdi. Our ancestors had such great intelligence, such a great spirit, and such great achievements. Do we not have them? Can we not inherit the glorious history and great achievements of our ancestors? The great intelligence, spirit, and achievements of our ancestors have certainly been passed down to us. We believe that our intelligence, spirit, and achievements will certainly not be much worse than those of the ancients. We should be able to build on the past and create a great cause. However, why is our nation so weak now, and why is our country so dangerous? The biggest fundamental reason is that the general public has forgotten the greatness of our ancestors and the glory of our national history. They have forgotten the greatest intelligence, the noblest virtue, the most excellent culture, and the most precious spirit inherent in their own nation. They have even forgotten the great foundation left by their ancestors and such magnificent rivers and mountains. Therefore, they have lost the inherent soul of the country and the nation, cannot respect themselves, cannot have confidence, cannot strive for progress, and have allowed the status of the country and the nation to decline and become increasingly dangerous. Yet, the general public is still unaware and does not strive to become stronger and save themselves, so as to shoulder the great responsibility of saving the country and revitalizing it. Everyone must understand that a person relies entirely on having a spirit and a soul. If one loses the soul and has no spirit, that person will certainly not be able to survive. Even if they temporarily survive, they are like dead people, what is called walking corpses, lingering breaths. The same is true for a country and a nation. If a country loses its soul and has no spirit, it will certainly perish and will not be able to continue to survive. The reason why our country and nation are in such a critical and declining state is precisely because we have lost the inherent and fundamental spirit and the true soul of our nation. Because we have no spirit and have lost our soul, we are scolded as half-dead, half-alive citizens, a half-dead, half-alive country and nation. Our country is in danger and our people are humiliated to this extent. How can we face our ancestors? How can we even have the face to live in the world? How can we see that our country and nation have already lost their inherent soul? We do not need to go to other provinces to see. Just looking at the current situation in Shaanxi, the birthplace of Chinese culture, can prove it. As I just said, Shaanxi is the birthplace of Chinese culture and the cradle of the Chinese nation. Since the Duke of Zhou, King Wen, and King Wu, countless sages and heroes have emerged from this place, which has always been known as a land of culture and propriety. The Duke of Zhou's creation of rites and music made ancient Chinese politics, education, and culture complete and magnificent, which also began in Shaanxi. But when we look at Shaanxi now, the land is still the same, and the people are still the same, but the relics of the past and the old rites and music are gone. The inherent virtues of the Chinese nation, that is, the eight virtues of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, harmony, and peace mentioned by the Generalissimo in the Three Principles of the People, as well as the fundamental spirit of China's founding for thousands of years, that is, the four dimensions of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame mentioned by Guan Zhong, are also neglected by many people. How can our country and nation not be in danger? Guan Zhong said that propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are the four dimensions of a country. If the four dimensions are not upheld, the country will perish. We recite these words and reflect on the past, and we cannot help but feel a chill down our spines. Now, if we want to save ourselves from danger and revitalize the nation, where should we start? The most important fundamental premise is that we must first restore the inherent soul of our country and nation. What is this soul? It is the eight virtues of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, harmony, and peace that I just mentioned. Our ancestors were able to promote these eight virtues, so they were able to build such a great nation and country. Now, because we do not emphasize the eight virtues and have lost our soul, our country is in danger and our people are humiliated to this day. Therefore, to save ourselves from danger and revitalize the nation, we must prescribe the right medicine and restore this great soul. How can we achieve this goal? In other words, how can we restore, express, and complete the eight virtues? We must first practice the four dimensions of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, especially starting with the word "propriety." For example, when we hold a memorial week today, everyone salutes the flag of the Party and the country and the portrait of the Generalissimo. This is a kind of propriety. From this propriety, we can show that we believe in the Generalissimo, are loyal to the Party and the country, and are willing to sacrifice everything for the Generalissimo, for the Party, and for the country. With this sincere and respectful intention, we can completely restore and fully promote the eight virtues of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, harmony, and peace, build a new country based on the Three Principles of the People, and revitalize our civilized and outstanding Chinese nation. The above is about the fundamental path for us to save ourselves from danger and revitalize the nation in the future, which lies in practicing the four dimensions and restoring the eight virtues. Now, I have one more point to add, that is, the practice of the four dimensions should start from daily life at any time and any place. That is, our food, clothing, housing, and transportation must all conform to propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame. The main purpose of the New Life Movement is also here. Therefore, if we want to practice the four dimensions, restore the eight virtues, save ourselves from danger, and revitalize the nation, we must promote the New Life Movement and improve our lives according to the standards of the New Life. Our simple and unadorned lifestyle has always been the legacy of Shaanxi, and everyone can generally achieve it. What we should pay the most attention to in the future is to strive to achieve the four standards of tidiness, cleanliness, speed, and certainty. The basic condition for achieving these four standards is diligence. Only with diligence can we be tidy, only with diligence can we be clean, and only with diligence can we be fast and certain. King Wen never had leisure from sunrise to sunset, and the Duke of Zhou continued day and night, sitting and waiting for dawn. This is the best model left by our ancestors. In the heyday of the country and the nation, the ancients were still so diligent. Now, when the country and the nation are in a critical situation, if we want to survive and revitalize, we must be extraordinarily diligent. I hope that all comrades in Shaanxi must cultivate diligence and endurance, practice the New Life Movement, and take the lead in promoting the New Life Movement, so as to influence others from themselves, spread from Shaanxi Province to the whole country, and enable all compatriots in the country to practice the New Life Movement, practice propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame. In this way, Shaanxi can shoulder the responsibility of revitalizing the nation, and be worthy of being the descendants of Emperor Huangdi and the followers of the Generalissimo. Everyone must remember that Shaanxi is the cradle of the Chinese nation and the birthplace of Chinese culture. Moreover, the people of Shaanxi have always been known for their chivalry, righteousness, and knowledge of propriety and shame. Since ancient times, Guanzhong has produced countless sages and heroes. Not only has there been no lack of people in history, but even recently, the legacy has not declined. Many revolutionary martyrs have struggled and sacrificed for the country, for the nation, and for the revolution. Therefore, Shaanxi, whether in terms of history, geography, culture, or politics, cannot be regarded as an ordinary province. It is the most important foundation of the country and the nation. Therefore, all comrades in Shaanxi, living in such an extraordinary place, must especially recognize the importance of their own position and the responsibilities they bear, and must especially strive to shoulder the mission of saving the country from danger and revitalizing the nation. In recent years, Shaanxi has made considerable progress in politics, military affairs, economy, and academics and culture. However, according to the current progress, it still cannot reach the expected standards and is not enough to shoulder the responsibility of revitalizing the nation. In the future, I hope that everyone will pay attention to the meaning of the four dimensions and the eight virtues that I have spoken about today, and strive to lay the foundation for the revolution and shoulder the responsibility of revitalizing the nation. In the past, King Wen, King Wu, the Duke of Zhou, Emperor Qin Shi Huang, Emperor Wu of Han, and Emperor Taizong of Tang all used Shaanxi as a foundation to build great countries and promote the prestige of the nation, which was rare in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. We are all descendants of our ancestors. The great intelligence, great spirit, and great foundation of our ancestors have been passed down to us. As long as we can recognize them clearly and can develop them, each of us can become King Wen, King Wu, the Duke of Zhou, Emperor Qin Shi Huang, Emperor Wu of Han, Emperor Taizong of Tang, etc. Although their careers were selfish to the emperors and are not suitable for today's modern times, their spirit of promoting national spirit and enhancing the history of China is a kind of spirit that we, as descendants, should be proud of, and everyone should have this kind of confidence in revitalizing the nation, and should not abandon themselves. Fellow comrades, especially the young people, must know that the current era environment in China is really the best opportunity that we can encounter in a thousand years to achieve great achievements and establish great careers. Whether from the historical, geographical, or cultural point of view, all kinds of conditions are complete. In particular, the current era environment can be said to be forcing us to become heroes and heroes who revitalize the nation. Now, as long as we can strive to become stronger and never give up, we will definitely be able to achieve the goal of revitalizing the nation and complete the mission of the era that we bear. This time I came to Xi'an, and I could not help but have infinite thoughts everywhere I touched the scene. At the same time, I also have infinite hopes for all comrades and fellow citizens in Shaanxi. Today, I took the opportunity of Memorial Week to report it briefly. I believe that everyone must have the same feelings, and will definitely be able to strive to fulfill everyone's responsibilities according to what I hope for everyone.

<p>(Gold and Silver) ▲London Gold Price: The London gold price fell two and a half pence this morning, to 142 shillings and 7 pence.</p>
<p>▲London Silver Bar: This morning, the silver price fell sharply. Speculators engaged in profit-taking, leading to a market price drop of one penny. The spot price is 23 and 875/1000 pence, and the futures price is 24 pence. The closing trend is stable.</p>
<p>▲Bombay Silver Bar: The Bombay silver price fell five pounds. The spot price is 67 rupees and 5 annas, the November price is 67 rupees and 6 annas, and the December price is 67 rupees and 10 annas. The market situation is stable.</p>
<p>(Exchange Rates) ▲British-American: This morning, the London foreign exchange market had a psychological reaction because U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau claimed that the United States would continue to purchase silver. The British-American exchange rate opened at 4 dollars, 9 cents, and 34375/10000, which was 3125/10000 lower than yesterday's closing price for the American-British exchange rate. It then rebounded immediately. At 2 p.m., the price was 4 dollars, 9 cents, and 475/100, which was 13125/10000 higher than the opening price. Also, one U.S. dollar is equivalent to 4 shillings and 0509/10000 British pounds.</p>
<p>▲British-French: The opening price was 74 francs and 09 centimes, which was six pounds lower than yesterday. But by 2 p.m., it had risen 12 pounds, to 74 francs and 21 centimes.</p>
<p>▲American-British: The New York foreign exchange market opened this morning with a sharp rise in the pound, at 4 dollars and 95 cents, which was 125/100 higher than yesterday's closing price. But soon after, it fell 75/100, to 4 dollars and 94 and 25/100 cents. At 10:40 a.m., this price had not changed.</p>
<p>(Cotton and Wheat) ▲American Cotton: The cotton market was firmer due to good news from Washington. Demand was quite strong, so the opening price rose about three pounds. There was some hedging, but it was absorbed. The latest price is about four pounds higher than the opening price.</p>
<p>▲Indian Cotton: The Bombay cotton market was closed today.</p>

<p>▲New York: When the rubber market opened, the upward trend of yesterday still existed. The opening price was about eleven pounds higher than yesterday's closing price. It then rose another four pounds. However, the bulls took the opportunity to close out positions, and the market price had already fallen six pounds at the time of the dispatch.</p>
<p>(Securities) ▲New York: The sentiment in the New York securities market before the opening this morning was that securities would respond to construction news and believed that the authorities would focus on commercial recovery rather than social improvement events in the coming months. However, there was nothing exciting about the real estate news. Merchants may not dare to follow easily when securities prices rise. When the securities market opened this morning, the market situation was firm and stable, and trading was quite active. Although the amount of the rise was limited to single digits, the sentiment was more pleasant than before, and the upward trend seemed to be expanding slightly. The various market prices of New York securities are listed on the left:</p>

<h3 id="e98">Yu Xuezhong Arrives in Hankou <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>After Visiting Zhang Xueliang, He Will Go to Beijing</p>
<p>Yu Discusses the Latest Situation in North China</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Yu Xuezhong, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, needs to report to Chairman Chiang and President Wang regarding the post-war problems in the war zone. He left Tianjin for Ping after attending the opening ceremony of the North China Games on the 12th, transferred to a special train on the Pinghan Railway southward, arrived in Zhengzhou on the evening of the 13th, and stayed for two days. Chairman Chiang and Deputy Commander Zhang happened to be going from Xi'an to Bian, so he came to Hankou from Zhengzhou on the 15th to pay his respects. At 6 p.m. on the 16th, he arrived at the Dazhimen Station in Hankou. The accompanying personnel were only Li Xigeng, Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Government, and Vice Adjutants Han and Mi. The military and political personnel here welcomed him warmly. After getting off the train, Yu stayed at the Yangtze River Hotel. When reporters sent their cards to visit, he was received and made a statement, saying that the security of Pingjin was very solid, and the war zone was also peaceful. However, since the Yutian Security Team incident and the Miyakoshi incident occurred one after another, the latent bandits began to stir. Fortunately, they have all been resolved peacefully. After Chairman Huang Yingbai returned to Ping and resumed his duties, progress has been made in the post-war negotiations in the war zone. At this plenary session of the Political Committee, it was decided to establish a war zone reorganization committee to be responsible for handling post-war matters. The outside world's claim that a war zone security office will be established is actually a misreporting of rumors. The handover of the counties within the Great Wall has been largely completed. Security is maintained by the security team. The handover of Dongling is currently under negotiation. Overall, the entire situation in North China is still optimistic. After the Changyuan breach, Sun Qingze, Director of the River Affairs Bureau, was removed from his post for ineffective protection. Due to the current flooding, the breach in the Yellow River cannot be blocked immediately. We can only first block the water flow to gradually reduce the breach. After the water recedes, we will make a fundamental defense plan. After I visit Deputy Commander Zhang in Hankou, I still plan to go to Beijing and then return to Tianjin via the Jinpu Railway, etc. (16th)</p>
<h3 id="e99">Yin Rugeng and Chayama Inspect the War Zone <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>First to Malanyu, Then to Dongling</p>
<p>Yutian Security Team Flees and Becomes Bandits</p>
<p>Tianjin Customs Establishes Xifengkou Branch Card at Panjiakou</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Yin Rugeng, Administrative Inspector of the Ji-Mi District, accompanied by Chayama Kenjiro, Army Attaché of the Japanese Embassy, Watanabe, Naval Attaché, He Xiaoyi, the new magistrate of Zunhua County, Huang Zhongkai, the magistrate of Yutian County, and others, a total of seven people, departed in two cars and a truck at 6:30 a.m. yesterday to inspect Malanyu Dongling. At 8 a.m., they passed through Tongxian. A squad from the first company of the second regiment of the war zone security force accompanied them for protection. They arrived in Jixian at 2 p.m. and stayed briefly. He Xiaoyi and Huang Zhongkai got off the bus and went to their respective posts. At 3 p.m., they continued to move forward. They arrived in Malanyu at 7 p.m. on the same day. Yin resided at the Malanyu Office, and Chayama and others resided at the Japanese Army Regiment Headquarters. They went to Dongling for inspection together this afternoon. After the matter, Chayama and others transferred to Tangshan. According to Yin's pre-departure statement, the purpose of this trip is: (1) Many of the Dongling buildings and tombs have been damaged and occupied in the past due to poor management, which should be investigated; (2) More than 10,000 Banner people living in the Dongling Malanyu area are living in poverty. After investigating the actual situation, we will discuss relief measures; (3) Prepare all necessary procedures for the handover. It is planned to stay in Changdi for one day and then return to Ping. Recently, a part of the Japanese puppet troops originally stationed in Malanyu were transferred out. The Japanese Kwantung Army stationed in Chengde Special Service Agency dispatched more than 100 people to the village on the 13th from Rehe to Malanyu to assist in handling the handover of Dongling. After the two groups of bandits in Zunhua and Yutian were defeated, they gathered in the Dabishan area. After being attacked by the Japanese puppet troops on the Great Wall line, the bandits dispersed and fled to the five counties of Pinggu, Shunyi, Miyun, Zunhua, and Huairou. A group that fled to Huairou was driven away by the security team on the 14th and scattered again. The war zone security team is currently on strict alert.</p>
<p>The Jixian-Miyun Commissioner's Office in Ping received a telephone report from the Zunhua County Government at 7 p.m. today (16th) that Yin Rugeng, Commissioner of Jixian-Miyun, Chayama Kenjiro, Military Attaché of the Japanese Embassy, and others passed through Zunhua and arrived in Malanyu at 7 p.m. last night (15th). Yin rested at the local commissioner's office and then went to Xinglong County to stay. Chayama went to the Japanese military unit Yoshida's unit to inspect. This morning, Yoshida sent a team to escort Yin and Chayama to Dongling for inspection. They returned to Zunhua at 5:30 p.m. that evening. The group stayed at the Zunhua County Government and decided to go to Yutian tomorrow morning (17th) to inspect the scene of the Miyakoshi case. It is expected to return to Beiping in three or four days.</p>
<p>According to people from Zunhua, many of the current Yutian security team have fled and become bandits. The joint defense of the Fengrun, Zunhua, and Jixian militia is blocking them. It is estimated that the Fengrun defense line runs from the Shaliu River to the Jieshangkou, the Zunhua defense line runs from the Jieshangkou to Gongli, and the Jixian defense line runs from west of Gongli to Yanshangkou, with Gongli as the main camp. The magistrates of Fengrun, Zunhua, and Yutian are all stationed in "Gongli" to direct the defense. The Zunhua militia is paid 60 cents per person per day for food. If there are deaths, each person is paid 300 yuan, and if there are injuries, 100 yuan. All are from Zunhua County. The county people now have the mentality of "better to be broken jade than a whole tile" and are determined to destroy their families to relieve the disaster.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Tianjin Customs Great Wall Five Pass Branch Cards, the Ministry of Finance, based on reports that smuggling was rampant at Panjiakou south of Xifengkou, ordered the Tianjin Customs to establish a Xifengkou Card Branch at that pass, limited to the 17th of this month. The Tianjin Customs has appointed Zhang Lianzhu as the director to prepare. He will prepare to establish an office tomorrow (17th). The announcement of the Beiping Office of the Tianjin Customs Great Wall Pass Branch Card Management Office is recorded as follows: "Inquiry Regarding the establishment of cards at various Great Wall passes, all Gubekou, Yiyuan, Lengkou, Xifengkou, and Jielingkou branch cards, the date of establishment, and the tax collection method have been announced by this Customs for your information. Now, according to the order of the Ministry of Finance, a branch office will be established at Panjiakou, which will be under the jurisdiction of the Xifengkou branch card. We hereby order you to comply. We have sent personnel to Panjiakou and prepared the branch office there. It will be established on October 17th and will start collecting taxes. The method is the same as that of the Great Wall branch cards. From now on, all goods passing through Panjiakou must go to the card office to comply with the regulations and verify them. Those who should pay taxes according to the Great Wall branch card tax collection method should also pay customs duties separately in accordance with the regulations. This announcement is hereby made to all Chinese and foreign merchants and people. This is the announcement. Supervisor Han Linsheng, Tax Commissioner Bos, Deputy Tax Commissioner Zhang Yongnian."

<h3 id="e100">Recent Work of the Mongolian Political Council <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Divided into two categories: Planning and Investigation</p>
<p>Japanese and Puppet Troops Prepare for Military Invasion of Mongolia</p>
<p>A dispatch from Beiping: After the central government decided to allocate funds monthly for the expenses of the Mongolian Autonomous Political Affairs Committee, all rumors were dispelled, and all misunderstandings were cleared away. Recently, there has been talk that the Mongolian Political Council will establish a representative office in Beiping to facilitate communication. De Wang, the Secretary-General of the council, sent Chen Shaowu as a representative to Nanjing and Jiangxi to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and President Wang Jingwei. Chen returned to Beiping from Nanjing a few days ago and told visitors that the rumors about Mongolia were not true. He also praised Chiang, Wang, and other important figures for their concern for the Mongolian border. Chen is scheduled to leave Beiping for Bailingmiao tomorrow (the 17th) to report back. This reporter visited Chen today (the 16th) to inquire about the work of the Mongolian Political Council, and he stated the following:</p>
<p>According to Chen Shaowu, the work of the Mongolian Political Council was indeed in a state of semi-suspension in the past due to funding issues. However, the members and staff did not feel discouraged, and there were no disagreements. Their sincerity towards the central government was not affected. The rumors circulating outside are best refuted by the facts. Chen also said that he felt spiritually comforted after meeting with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and President Wang Jingwei, which cannot be expressed in a few words. He has telegraphed De Wang about the details and will present Chairman Chiang's personal letter when he returns to the temple. Chiang gave detailed instructions on the Mongolian political measures, which the Mongolian Political Council will implement accordingly. As for the recent work of the Mongolian Political Council, it can be broadly divided into two categories: planning and investigation. The planning aspect is divided into education, industry, security, and civil administration. Because education in Mongolia is relatively backward, the first step is to promote production education and universal education. In terms of industry, because Mongolia is vast and transportation is inconvenient, all construction is affected. Therefore, the industrial plan focuses on transportation infrastructure. As for security, because the Mongolian border defense is weak, and Mongolians are skilled in horsemanship and archery, it is planned to recruit twenty Mongolians from each banner for equestrian training for a period of six months. After graduation, they will return to their original banner to be responsible for local defense. In terms of civil administration, all measures must start with investigation due to the religious ties of the Mongolian people. When Chen finally spoke about the funding issue of the council, he happily told the reporter that the central government has decided to allocate 30,000 yuan per month, which can be used for staff salaries and office expenses. As for construction costs, they will be discussed in the future.</p>
<p>A certain agency in Beiping received intelligence from Rehe this morning (the 16th) stating that the puppet organization intends to place the Ujimqin and Bairin banners under the jurisdiction of the puppet Xing'an Province in order to seize the Mongolian salt flats. The princes of the two banners, believing that the salt flats are of great importance to the livelihood of the Mongolian people, refused to comply. In late last month, they jointly led more than 20,000 Mongolian soldiers from the two banners and engaged in fierce clashes with the Japanese and puppet troops in Linxi County, shooting down four Japanese planes. The situation is serious. The Japanese and puppet troops are now concentrated on the highways around Tongliao, Kailu, Suidong, and Chifeng, preparing to conquer Mongolia by force. According to foreign sources, the Ujimqin and Bairin banners are the strongest among the leagues and banners of Inner Mongolia. They are currently in conflict with the Japanese and puppet troops and are in a stalemate. The future developments are worthy of attention. (Note: Linxi County is about 1,200 li from Chengde. Ujimqin is under the jurisdiction of the Xilingol League and is on the border of Chahar. Bairin is under the jurisdiction of the Josutu League and is within Rehe.) (16th)</p>

<p>Gu Shaochuan, the envoy to France and a native of this county, in order to help the common people of his hometown, has joined with Gu Jisheng, Tao Jiyuan, and other prominent merchants from this county who reside in Shanghai to raise capital and establish a cotton mill in this county. They have already selected a site next to the Lianqi River on the Xihu Road outside the West Gate and have submitted a request to the county government for permission to purchase land from the people. They are actively proceeding with the project.</p>

<p>During a house cleaning at the Yangwang Temple in Waigang a few days ago, four 75mm flat-trajectory cannon shells, two field artillery shell heads, two mortar shells, four grenades with handles, four grenades without handles, and two steel helmets were found in the jumbled bricks behind the shrine. They are believed to have been hidden by the National Revolutionary Army during the January 28th Incident. They have been sent to the town's public education center for public display.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Wuxi: Butchers Strike and Petition <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The slaughter tax for the meat industry in the urban area was previously 69.3 yuan per day. After Shou Hezhang (i.e., Mu Jun) contracted it, the amount was increased, and he negotiated with the meat merchants to increase it by 10 yuan per day. The meat merchants refused. Later, the county chamber of commerce mediated and suggested an increase of 5 yuan. The meat merchants only agreed to 4.2 yuan, which was not resolved. The meat merchants then voluntarily agreed to be taxed item by item, which took effect on the 16th. The slaughter tax collection office then dispatched a large number of staff to the shops to collect the tax item by item. For some reason, the collection office sent Lu Guangchang, Ji Bingzhang, Lu Gaojian, Guo Zhiyuan, Hu Abing of Xin Sanzhen, and Zhou Xusheng of Hongyishun to the Public Security Bureau for detention. At 4:00 p.m. that afternoon, the county chamber of commerce mediated again, but failed to resolve the issue. This aroused the resentment of the entire meat industry, and they all went on strike on the 17th. Yesterday morning, more than 300 people appointed Yao Zhongqing, Lian Jianshu, Zhu Xifan, Xu Zhuyou, Ren Shouqin, Wang Yulin, and Shao Tinglan as representatives to petition the county party headquarters, requesting two things: (1) Please order the county Public Security Bureau to immediately release the detained colleagues and ensure that similar incidents do not occur again. (2) Since taxes are already being collected item by item, do not use this as an excuse to harass them. As for the issue of stamping pig carcasses, which affects business and public health, please change it to stamping the head. Commissioner Xu Chizi came out to meet them and promised to discuss the four detained meat merchants with the county government and order the Public Security Bureau to release them. The issue of item-by-item stamping should be mediated by the county chamber of commerce. The petition representatives then went to the county government to petition, and County Magistrate Yan personally met them and advised them to resume business immediately to avoid losses. Since the dispute is being mediated by the chamber of commerce, the chamber of commerce should be responsible for resolving it. There is no problem with the request to release the four detained colleagues. At 12:00 noon, they went to the county chamber of commerce to petition and submitted a letter requesting assistance. Zou Tongyi and Li Bosen met with them and promised to forward the original letter, but they said that the chamber of commerce could not mediate the dispute between the meat merchants and the tax office because the opinions of both sides were in conflict, making mediation difficult and creating a stalemate. The petition representatives left because their petition was unsuccessful. It is feared that this dispute will escalate.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Sudden Change to Severe Cold Weather <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The weather this summer was hot and dry, and since autumn, after the lunar Mid-Autumn Festival, it was still exceptionally muggy. People were still sweating in single-layer clothing. Unexpectedly, in the past two days, the weather has suddenly turned severely cold, with the Fahrenheit thermometer dropping to 49 degrees. People feel cold even in cotton-padded clothing. Fortunately, the weather is clear, and it warms up slightly in the afternoon. However, because of this drastic change in temperature, throat ailments are very prevalent in the city.</p>

<p>Zhang Yaoshan, the 40-year-old owner of the Xinda South Goods Store in Xicang Bridge under the shed outside the West Gate, has a mother, a wife, a son, and two daughters. The children are all young. When Zhang first opened the south goods store, business was good. Recently, due to the economic downturn, business plummeted, leading to financial difficulties and heavy debt. In addition, Zhang was addicted to gambling and often lost, which made things even more difficult. He became weary of life and secretly took many sleeping pills the day before yesterday morning. Around 7:00 p.m. that evening, the poison took effect, causing vomiting. His wife discovered it and immediately called Dr. Hong Chun for treatment. However, the poisoning was too deep, and there was no hope of recovery. He died at 8:30 a.m. yesterday, which is very tragic.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Changzhou: Three-Hall Committee Surveys Disaster Conditions <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Wu County has suffered severe drought this year, and many fields in various townships have yielded no harvest. The disaster relief committee is currently raising funds for emergency relief in order to gather a sufficient amount to distribute to the disaster areas in advance. The county government had already dispatched officials to conduct preliminary surveys of the affected fields, compile a register, and submit a report. Now, Shen Deren from the Civil Affairs Hall, Hua Zhenji from the Finance Hall, and Shen Zhuoran from the Construction Hall have arrived in Changzhou to jointly conduct a survey. After contacting the county government, they dispatched Lu Zezhi, the head of the Second Section, to accompany them on a re-survey. The three-hall committee and the county committee hired a boat today (the 17th) to go to Xiangxia Yiqiao and other places to investigate, and then to other townships, which will take about ten days to complete.</p>

<p>Buddhist scholar Master Taixu, invited by the Huiyin Temple in Dantu Town, arrived in Zhenjiang from Nanjing at around 6:00 p.m. yesterday to transmit precepts and lecture on sutras at the temple. The abbots of the major temples in the city had received the news in advance and went to the station to welcome him. After Master Taixu got off the train, he greeted everyone with clasped hands and boarded a car directly to the Chao'an Temple in Xiaomatou, where he rested. Xue Song, the abbot of the temple, hosted a vegetarian feast for the master, which was attended by Abbot Wenjue of Dinghui Temple in Jiaoshan, Customs Commissioner Zhang, and the abbots of various monasteries. During the meal, he told them that after returning from Lushan, where he had escaped the summer heat, he had stayed in the capital for a while. Now, because Huiyin Temple is holding a precept transmission ceremony, Abbot Ronggen invited him to lecture on the sutras for a few days. He himself also wanted to travel to Zhenjiang, which has many famous mountains and ancient temples. He will go to Dantu to lecture on the sutras tomorrow (i.e., this morning). After that, he plans to return to his hometown for a short stay. It is said that Xue Song, the abbot of Chao'an Temple, and Customs Commissioner Zhang have jointly invited Lu Xiaobo and other prominent figures in the Zhenjiang business community to invite Taixu to give public lectures in the province for a few days after he finishes lecturing at Huiyin Temple in order to promote the true essence of Buddhism.</p>

<p>Chen Hai, an apprentice at a Chen surname shoe store in the west of the city, was brutally murdered while going out to relieve himself at night. His body was found in the fields of a Zhou surname. The Public Security Bureau arrested suspects Zhang Libin (male), Song Shou, Chen Hui (female), Song Yao (female), and others and handed them over to the court. The Criminal Division opened the trial on the 16th. Zhang and others firmly denied committing the murder and were remanded in custody for investigation.</p>

<p>This summer has been long and dry, and the crops have withered. The autumn harvest is less than 30%, making it the worst disaster in sixty years. Former County Magistrate Zhang reported this to the Civil Affairs, Finance, and Construction Halls, which dispatched Ren Yingcang, Jiang Boru, and Wang Zhihong as autumn harvest assessment commissioners to Haimen to conduct a survey with Former County Magistrate Zhang. They then convened a meeting of representatives from various agencies and organizations to discuss the autumn harvest assessment. The three commissioners proposed 70%, but the representatives insisted that the maximum limit was 50%. The two sides argued for a long time, and the meeting ended without a result. The three commissioners still reported 70%, but the Finance Hall thought the number was too low and ordered the county to increase the levy as appropriate and wait for approval. Yesterday (the 15th), County Magistrate Chen notified various agencies and organizations that a meeting will be held this afternoon (the 16th) to discuss the matter. In addition, residents of the county, such as Zhang Chujiang, believe that the assessment set by the three commissioners is not based on the actual situation and violates the intention of the provincial halls to be mindful of the people's difficulties. Yesterday, they specially petitioned the provincial government and the Civil Affairs, Finance, and Construction Halls to send officials to conduct a re-survey.</p>

<p>Qidong Chuanhonggang is located in a remote area along the river with a sparse population. Many drug dealers often hide there to manufacture and sell red pills to various townships in large quantities. The county government learned of this the day before yesterday and secretly ordered Xie Yun, the director of the police department, to lead more than a dozen policemen to arrest them. More than 1,000 red pills were seized in the Chen Yougen teahouse, and the drug dealer Chen Yougen was arrested and sent to the county government for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Yangzhou: Envoy Miao's Coercion of the People Leads to Unrest <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>All sectors of Yangzhou have repeatedly petitioned for a delay in the relocation of the salt industry to the north, but have not been granted permission. Now, Envoy Miao arrived here from the province on the Zhenyang train at the Weishi hour on the 16th and entered the city to stay at the Deputy Salt Commissioner's Office. He first went to the Yangzhou Inspection Office to rest. The leaders of all sectors who were attending the county administrative meeting temporarily appointed Dai Tianqiu, Zhang Jichuan, Bao Xiangzhong, and Guo Lanshi as representatives to visit him at the office. However, the envoy's attitude was firm, and they did not get what they wanted. The joint association for maintaining the salt industry, in the name of the county party headquarters, convened an emergency meeting and decided to appoint Teng Yizhai, Han Guohua, Shi Ruizhan, Xi Kuishi, Ling Gengbo, and Qi Mingzhi as representatives to go to the Yangzhou Inspection Office Deputy's dormitory to petition the envoy. However, the guard at the dormitory, under orders, held a grenade launcher to intimidate them, refusing to let them enter. They waited outside the gate for a long time before the gate was opened and they were told to send representatives to meet the envoy. Teng and the other six representatives then submitted their calling cards and entered. However, Deputy Salt Commissioner Jin Xiangsheng met them instead, saying that it was mealtime and there were many female guests, so he had no time to meet them. He suggested that they wait or come back tomorrow. The representatives requested a meeting, but Jin said that it would be best to submit a written statement. The representatives then handed the petition to Jin to answer on his behalf. After a while, Jin came out and threw back the petition, saying that he would not meet them today or tomorrow. The representatives still tried to insist, but they were suddenly driven out by a police siren. Suddenly, dozens of armed tax police, carrying guns and ammunition, charged in with jeep-like vehicles. The petitioners fled in all directions. The dormitory lights went out at the same time. The tax police were stationed separately, and traffic was cut off, as if a major enemy had arrived. The envoy then returned to the Deputy Salt Commissioner's Office under armed escort. At 9:00 p.m., all sectors, angered by the envoy's arrogance, which was worse than that of a warlord, gathered at the Chamber of Commerce for an emergency meeting. They decided that the commercial, agricultural, educational, and automobile associations would jointly sign a telegram to County Magistrate Ma of the county government, stating that the relocation of the salt industry has caused panic throughout the county. Today, we were pleased to meet Envoy Miao Qiujie of Yangzhou. Representatives of all sectors of the people went to petition him, but Envoy Miao refused to meet them and ordered the tax police to threaten and expel them with guns, and mobilized a large number of tax police, carrying guns and ammunition, to charge at the people and order their arrest. Fortunately, they escaped quickly and avoided disaster. It is unbearable that he abuses his official power and uses violent means to deal with the people. The public is extremely angry and fears that an accident will occur. In addition to telegraphing the capital and provinces to send personnel to investigate and severely punish him, we hereby telegraph your government to protect the lives of the people and maintain public security, and simultaneously telegraph the Ministry of Finance, the Salt Administration, and the Executive Yuan. (The rest of the text is omitted.) It is also said that all sectors are extremely angry and declared a general strike of markets, classes, and workers on the 17th at the Chamber of Commerce meeting. If this is realized, traffic between Yangzhou and Zhenjiang will inevitably be cut off.</p>

<p>Chen Bofang, the 24-year-old principal of Hanxia Baocui Elementary School in the Fourth District of Yuyao, suffered a sudden mental breakdown last year due to the stimulus of losing love. He disappeared once in July. Later, his family and others brought him back and kept him at home. This autumn, because he was a little more stable, the surveillance was relaxed. Unexpectedly, he suddenly ran away again on the 8th of this month. His family was panicked and searched everywhere without a trace. Until yesterday (the 15th), his body was suddenly found in the river near Yitaishan Temple. Yang Jinshun, a constable from Gaoyi Township Office, pulled the body ashore and immediately reported it to his sister, Ms. Chen Guanying, who identified it and made arrangements for the coffin.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Gu Xinyi Urges the Ministry of Finance to Amend the Stamp Tax Law <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Gu Xinyi, chairman of the Shanghai Soybean and Rice Industry Association, telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday, saying: "To Minister Kong of the Nanjing Ministry of Finance, Recently, it has been reported that the Legislative Yuan has drafted a stamp tax law. Article 16 lists that 1. invoices, 2. receipts for money and goods, 3. bills, all with an amount of three yuan or more, will have a stamp of one cent affixed for every ten yuan. Regarding the one-cent stamp starting at three yuan, your consideration of the merchants' difficulties is deeply appreciated. However, with respect to affixing a one-cent stamp for every ten yuan, this treats these extremely common, very minor rights, short-term proofs as goods of value and imposes a progressive heavy tax, which is many times, even dozens of times, higher than the tax rate of the current provisional stamp tax regulations promulgated by your ministry. This differs greatly and is clearly inconsistent with Article 5 of the principles of the Stamp Tax Law established by the Central Political Conference last year, which states that lighter taxation should be applied to proofs with minor validity or rights, or short usage periods, and Article 6, which states that fixed tax rates should be adopted for proofs of frequent actions. This will only lead to the decline of all industries, the withering of the market, and the extreme plight of merchants. Having heard that the government is vigorously abolishing harsh and miscellaneous taxes, we were deeply gratified, believing that there was hope for recovery. Unexpectedly, the stamp tax law drafted by the Legislative Yuan imposes a progressive tax on the above-mentioned proofs that are used daily in the market, which is similar to a harsh and miscellaneous tax. Not only is it impossible for merchants to bear this after their exhaustion, but it also seems difficult for the government's credibility to be enforced. Therefore, I dare to telegraph you and request that you review it and forward it to the Executive Yuan, which will consult the Legislative Yuan and earnestly request that it be revised again in accordance with the principles established by the Central Political Conference last year, in order to alleviate the merchants' difficulties and facilitate implementation. I am overwhelmed with eagerness and trepidation. Respectfully, Gu Xinyi, chairman of the Shanghai Soybean and Rice Industry Association."</p>

<h3 id="e124">Jiaxu Disaster Relief Association Raises Large Funds to Purchase 100,000 Shi of Foreign Rice <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>For Winter and Spring Relief Needs</p>
<p>Requests Authorities to Issue Tax-Exempt Passports</p>
<p>The Jiaxu Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association, in order to prepare and advance large sums of money, is sending personnel to various locations such as Nanyang, Siam, and Java to purchase 100,000 shi of relief rice. This rice will be shipped in batches to Shanghai and then transported to the interior to provide winter relief. The association yesterday sent a special telegram to the Zhejiang Provincial Government requesting that they forward a request to the Ministry of Finance to issue tax-exempt passports in order to benefit the disaster victims. Additionally, letters and telegrams have been sent to various organizations across the country soliciting aid. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e125">Banking Sector Suggests Forming a Silver Price Stabilization Committee <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>And is Willing to Have Each Bank Contribute to its Fund</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance is Currently Studying and Considering the Proposal</p>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, since the Ministry of Finance implemented the increased silver export tax, and based on the London silver price, converted to the Shanghai exchange rate, the difference between this exchange rate and the exchange rate determined by the Central Bank on that day, after paying the export tax, is still insufficient. In such cases, a balancing tax is levied based on the amount of the deficiency, which is announced daily by the Central Bank at 11:30 AM. To stabilize silver prices, the Ministry of Finance is planning to establish a silver price stabilization committee. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the banking sector yesterday that the proposal to establish the silver price stabilization committee was made by the banking sector to the Ministry of Finance. Minister Kong Xiangxi is currently considering and studying this proposal. It is understood that various countries in Europe and America have organizations for price stabilization committees and have a large amount of funds for balancing foreign exchange. The proposal from our country's banking sector is also based on the methods of various countries. It is rumored that if the Ministry of Finance approves the establishment, banks such as the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications will be responsible for its funding.</p>
<p>(Standing Committee Meeting) The association held its fifth regular standing committee meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM at its meeting place. Over thirty people attended, including Chu Huiseng, Yu Zhongxian, Zhang Xiaolin, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Shenzhi, Qu Wenliu, Huang Hanzhi, etc. Chu Huiseng presided over the meeting, Chen Weixuan recorded the proceedings. After the chairman reported on the letters and telegrams requesting aid from Lin'an, Xinchang, Jiangshan, Yuqian, Tonglu, Chongde, Changxing, and other places, the following proposals were discussed. Qu Wenliu proposed the issue of whether to send people to investigate the disaster situation in various counties and how to allocate the advance funds for relief. It was resolved to consult with the Zhejiang Relief Association to determine the severity of the disaster and each identify areas for relief and distribute aid separately. The method for distributing advance funds was to allocate 5,000 yuan to the counties with the most severe disasters, 4,000 yuan to those with the next most severe, and 3,000 yuan to those with the third most severe. A total of 100,000 yuan was temporarily allocated for emergency relief. Chairman Chu Huiseng was recommended to go to Hangzhou to negotiate with the Provincial Government. Over ten investigators were also dispatched to carry report forms and inspect the disaster situation in various counties. The meeting adjourned at approximately 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>(Submission to Zhejiang Provincial Government) The association submitted a document to the Zhejiang Provincial Government, stating: "To the esteemed Zhejiang Provincial Government, this year's drought in Zhejiang Province has resulted in a disaster, with the autumn harvest of fields and crops being hopeless. According to the investigation report of the National Government Relief Committee, the disaster-stricken area covers 70 counties and one city in the entire province. The coastal and mountainous rural areas, in particular, have suffered a complete crop failure. Just as new grains are entering the market, rice prices continue to rise incessantly, making the situation even more unimaginable by the time the green and yellow crops are out of season next spring. Zhejiang Province's rice production is inherently insufficient, and it has relied on commercial transportation from other provinces such as Xichang, Xiang, and Gan for many years. Now, all regions are suffering from drought, and the source of supply is about to dry up, making the food situation for the people all the more worrying. Our association has repeatedly convened meetings and plans to raise a large sum of money to purchase 100,000 shi of relief grain from Nanyang, Siam, Java, and other places, and ship them in batches to Shanghai for transportation to the counties most severely affected by the disaster in the interior for winter and spring relief. However, to reduce transportation costs and save relief funds, we earnestly request that you forward our request to the Ministry of Finance, examine and follow the regulations on tax exemption for disaster relief goods, and approve an official order to the Customs Administration and the Shanghai Customs to exempt the import tax on this relief grain, in order to benefit the impoverished people and emphasize the importance of disaster relief. If approved, we will prepare a detailed list of tax-exempt passport requests for relief grain and submit it for forwarding and approval. This case concerns the purchase of a large amount of grain, so we earnestly request you to examine and approve it promptly. This is for the public convenience. Sincerely, the Jiaxu Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association, Xiao."</p>
<p>(Telegram Soliciting Aid) The association sent a letter and telegram to various organizations across the country yesterday, soliciting aid, stating: "This year's drought in Zhejiang has resulted in a disaster. From summer to autumn, it has not rained for a hundred days, and the number of affected counties has reached as many as sixty-nine. Fields and crops have withered, and the autumn harvest is hopeless. In addition to the years of consecutive crop failures, the entire region has suffered a common calamity. Starving people are crying out, anxiously awaiting food. We have now gathered colleagues from inside and outside the province to establish the Jiaxu Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association, using the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai on Tibet Road as the meeting place. We have published donation appeals and are assigning responsibilities for soliciting donations. We humbly hope that renowned figures and prominent figures in our hometowns will have compassion for this great calamity and generously contribute to our cause. Every penny and ounce is welcome, and no amount is too large. More relief funds mean more lives saved. Millions of disaster victims are waiting with outstretched necks. Your lofty friendship is no different from experiencing it ourselves.

<p>Since the beginning of this year, a large amount of cash from Sichuan Province, totaling 20 million yuan, has been successively remitted to Shanghai, causing the exchange rate between Chongqing and Wanxian to rise to a maximum of 1,370 yuan to equal 1,000 Shanghai dollars. Subsequently, the Sichuan provincial authorities restricted the exchange rate to no more than 1,250 yuan, but in reality, this had no effect. The exchange rate continued to soar, increasing even more drastically in recent days, reaching over 1,400 yuan yesterday, creating a new record since the Republic of China. Sichuan merchants primarily purchased cotton yarn and, to a lesser extent, general merchandise from Shanghai. Since the exchange rate has risen sharply, the cost of purchasing Shanghai goods has increased by 40%, so they have all telegraphed Shanghai to suspend purchases.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Land Bureau Announces Acquisition of Private Land in Longhua <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>According to the Shen Shi News Agency, preparations for opening the Longhua air and water airport began several months ago. However, the amount of land purchased is limited and insufficient. Yesterday, the Municipal Land Bureau issued Announcement No. 141, stating: "Regarding the case of expanding the Longhua Airport and acquiring land, the Municipal Government has already publicly announced the designated area and attached a map. We are now instructed to announce this in accordance with the law. A detailed list is provided. In addition to separately notifying the relevant property owners, we must immediately comply with the designated area, attach a detailed list, and submit a copy of the approved valuation table for the land to be expanded for the airport, as well as the amount of compensation for relocation of graves and agricultural losses. This announcement is for public knowledge. All property owners with evidence of land ownership should promptly gather and submit it to the Longhua Airport and the joint office of the Municipal Government for verification and negotiation of land prices. All property owners must comply and not delay. This is the announcement."</p>
<p>In addition to announcing the acquisition, the Land Bureau also set a valuation table for the land and various compensation fees. A reporter from the Shen Shi News Agency has specially recorded the following: East along the Huangpu River, 700 yuan per mu; west of the Huangpu River and along Longhua Road, 500 yuan per mu; west of the Great Training Ground, 400 yuan per mu; north end of Longhua Road, 380 yuan per mu; south end of Longhua Road, 350 yuan per mu; along the Pujiang beach (with food department certificate), 280 yuan per mu. Compensation for relocating graves and coffins ranges from 2 yuan to 14 yuan, and agricultural losses are 4 yuan per mu.</p>

<p>Wang Jialie Personally Supervises the Pursuit and Suppression</p>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, military operations to suppress bandits in Fujian and Jiangxi are progressing daily, and the Red bandits are showing signs of total collapse. After the Xiao Ke bandit gang fled to Hunan and were defeated by the Hunan and Guangxi armies, they fled into Guizhou Province. Recently, a certain organization in this city obtained a military report from Guizhou Province stating that the commander of the 25th Army, Wang Jialie, personally supervised the suppression, and the Xiao bandits had been routed into disarray. The original telegram is recorded as follows: "(Two) The Xiao bandits were about to reach Longxi when the Fujian and Guizhou armies caught up and pursued them. They then retreated from Taipingpu back to the vicinity of Wengan and were intercepted and suppressed by the Guizhou army returning from Longxi to Houchang. Many were killed. The bandits took advantage of the night to take the road through Heba Village and fled towards Shitang Tangtou in Shiqian. The Guizhou army followed closely in pursuit. Army Commander Wang Jialie personally supervised the team and followed closely. On Geng (8th), they had reached 囗囗. (Two) Division Commander Li Jueyu of the Hunan Army (6th) arrived at Baisha in Shiqian. Army Commander Liao of the Guangxi Army arrived at the line of Difang Changwei Shiqian to intercept and suppress them. The bandits had fled into the territory of Yuweng.

<h3 id="e132">Director of the National Bureau of Weights and Measures, Wu Chengluo, Left Shanghai for Hong Kong Yesterday <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>To Inspect Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Fujian</p>
<p>Since Wu Chengluo (Zi Jiandong) took charge of the Bureau of Weights and Measures of the Ministry of Industries, the promotion of weights and measures administration has been quite effective. Recently, Mr. Wu, in view of the fact that the new system has gradually become widespread in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hubei, Shandong, and Hebei, decided to personally inspect the situation in the provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Fujian to thoroughly understand the national promotion. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, he boarded the Jefferson of the Da Lai Company for Hong Kong, and then went to the provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi. Many people from the academic and engineering circles of this city accompanied him. A reporter from the Datong News Agency met Mr. Wu on the ship and recorded his conversation as follows: According to Mr. Wu, regarding the standardization of weights and measures throughout the country, the central government believes that this is the foundation of economic and social construction, and also the first step towards rationalizing industry. Therefore, it is determined to complete the work in the shortest possible time, that is, to implement standardization before the end of political tutelage and the beginning of constitutional government. The degree of progress can now be said to be consistent throughout the country. In the provinces along the Yangtze River and the coast, the standardization work has spread from cities to villages due to convenient transportation. Even in the northwest, which is located on the frontier, they are actively engaged in this work. In recent years, in addition to adhering to the guidelines of the Ministry in the central government and engaging in measures for weights and measures administration, the manufacture of standards, and the training of inspection specialists, I have also regularly gone to various provinces, cities, and counties in stages, in order to contribute to the local areas. The local areas' eagerness to expect weights and measures administration is sometimes even greater than that of the central government. The actual work of standardization truly relies on the perseverance of local officials and the sincere acceptance of local industrial and academic circles. The southwestern provinces are also carrying out this administration with great intensity, which is a blessing for the entire political unity of our country. This time, I was ordered by the government to go to Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Fujian provinces for inspection. In addition to weights and measures administration, I also plan to conduct a detailed investigation of industrial construction. The southwest has a whole step and solid advancement for the construction of industrial production, and its effects can also be used as a reference for the central government's policy implementation and a model for other provinces. In addition, the central government takes weights and measures as the basis, and then seeks to formulate and implement standard specifications for various agricultural and industrial industries. These standards should conform to scientific theory on the one hand, and also refer to the habits of our country on the other hand. Therefore, the established rules of various industries in the southwest are also included in the investigation, etc.</p>

<p>Tragic Incident of Destroying Saltpeter Ponds</p>
<p>The Police Sergeant Responsible Has Been Taken into Custody</p>
<p>According to Datong News Agency, the case of tax police in Changlu shooting salt farmers in Daming has attracted considerable attention from various parties. Yesterday, the Salt Affairs Audit General Office received a memorial from Zeng Yangfeng, the Changlu Salt Commissioner, reporting on the circumstances of the incident. Datong News Agency reporters have investigated the situation from all sides as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e141">Report from the Tax Police Side <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The Salt Affairs Audit General Office received a report yesterday from Zeng Yangfeng, the Changlu Salt Commissioner, stating that according to a telegram from Inspector Li Peien and Zhang Ziying, the chief of the 8th district tax police, on the morning of the 8th, while leading a team and local militia police in the area of Zhao Gu Village in Daming, they were suddenly attacked by thousands of saltpeter bandits firing guns. Despite the efforts of Cheng, the head of the Bao Wei Tuan [Self-Defense Corps], and the head of the Public Security Bureau to persuade them, the bandits demanded that the tax police disarm or leave Deputy Yang to be dealt with by the saltpeter farmers. At that time, the crowd of bandits was closing in, and many police officers were injured, leaving them no choice but to return fire in self-defense, killing and wounding more than ten bandits on the spot and seizing five red-tasseled spears. The matter is currently under investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Telegram from the Daming County Magistrate <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>In addition, according to a telegram from the Daming County Magistrate, tax police leveled salt ponds and have been convening village chiefs for days to persuade the people, ordering the police and militia to assist in the process, which was progressing smoothly. Unexpectedly, on the Geng day (8th) at 2:00 PM, there was a gathering of people in Zhao Gu and other villages. The tax police opened fire, and the people scattered. The county magistrate personally went to the scene to investigate and found twelve dead and thirteen wounded. The county magistrate is currently dividing his efforts to persuade and handle the aftermath. The office has ordered the chief of the tax police bureau to rush to the scene to investigate and handle the matter impartially.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Custody of the Police Sergeant Involved <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>According to inquiries made by reporters from related parties, after receiving the above telegram, Zeng Yangfeng, the Changlu Salt Commissioner, immediately dispatched Zhang Zhongli, the chief of the tax police bureau, to conduct an on-the-spot investigation and consult with County Magistrate Cheng on the aftermath. He also placed Yang Yi, the police sergeant who opened fire, under custody. However, the public believes that the tax police shot and killed dozens of salt farmers, causing an unprecedented tragedy. Public sentiment is very tense. After County Magistrate Cheng persuaded the people and promised to provide compensation to the deceased, the situation has eased.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Plan to Destroy Saltpeter Ponds <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>According to those familiar with the salt affairs, the Changlu Yamen's [government office] implementation of the plan to destroy saltpeter ponds was jointly decided by both the yamen and the office beforehand. The measures are briefly described as follows: (1) In the southwestern counties of Hebei Province, where the land is barren and the people are poor, permission has been obtained to reduce the salt tax by one yuan per dan [unit of weight] to ease the burden and combat private sales. (2) Special tax police squads are organized, together with local police and militia, as well as commercial patrols, to form a mixed destruction team to destroy privately established saltpeter ponds in various counties. (3) Measures are drafted for local officials to assist in promoting the sale of official salt and investigating and punishing saltpeter, in order to promote cooperation.</p>

<p>According to another point of view, the Changlu Yamen's implementation of the plan to destroy saltpeter ponds, which concerns the people's food and the nation's tax revenue, is indeed a legitimate measure. However, the Changlu Salt Commissioner, Zeng Yangfeng, and the tax police personnel acted hastily, leading to a major tragedy, which was a mishandling of the situation and cannot be excused. It is also said that the General Office also attaches great importance to this case and will investigate it thoroughly.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Shanghai Municipal Council Agrees to Increase the General Hotel Tax in Three Stages <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>But the Hotel Industry Still Expresses Dissatisfaction</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the case of the Shanghai Municipal Council in the Public Concession increasing the winter police tax on the hotel industry has not yet been resolved despite appeals from the Hotel Association to various sectors. The seven hotels that the Municipal Council plans to increase the tax on, including Da Zhonghua, Dongfang, Xin Shijie, Jue Lu, Wu Gong, Da Shanghai, and Hui Zhong, have successively sent the taxes they should pay, but they have been rejected. The hotels believe that with the depression in all industries, it is difficult to comply with the increased tax. Therefore, they are determined to oppose it. The Hotel Industry previously asked Yu Qiaqing to mediate. Mr. Yu contacted Mr. Bourne, the head of the tax department of the Municipal Council. Mr. Bourne stated that he would change the method of increasing the tax and increase it in three stages according to the original tax amount: the first stage is an increase of one-quarter, the second stage is an increase of one-half, and the third stage is a full increase. However, the Hotel Industry is still firmly opposed to this.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Writes to Freight Truck Industry to Maintain Order and Await Resolution <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>And Submits a Petition to the Municipal Government for Consideration</p>
<p>The freight truck industry in this city has voluntarily suspended business due to its inability to bear the vehicle tax, and has requested the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce for assistance. The Chamber of Commerce has now forwarded a petition to the Municipal Government, requesting consideration, and has also replied to the industry, urging it to maintain order. The letter is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Document Submitted to the Municipal Government: A report respectfully requesting consideration of the facts. On the 16th of this month, the Freight Truck Industry Association stated in a letter that its members are facing the approaching winter license renewal period, and the case has not been resolved. Therefore, they have unanimously suspended business from today (the 15th) to seek the final understanding of the municipal authorities. The association, witnessing the difficult times, lacks the means to remedy the situation. In accordance with the resolution of the general meeting, it has instructed the representatives of each district to persuade members during the suspension to avoid unexpected disturbances and to maintain order while awaiting resolution. The suspension of business is a matter of great importance, and if it is prolonged, it will inevitably affect various industries and cause social panic. Therefore, it is forced to send a letter to your association to be forwarded to the Municipal Government, respectfully requesting the following points: (1) Please revise the original vehicle tax proposal. (2) Before the revision, winter licenses should be paid temporarily according to the autumn tax amount. (3) The case of requiring insurance for third parties this season to be approved for license issuance should be handled in the same way as the rental car industry, by paying a deposit to obtain a license. It is hoped that the matter will be reviewed and approved, in the interest of public welfare. The association has investigated the reasons for requesting exemption from the increased vehicle tax, and the aforementioned public association has previously presented various differences between freight trucks and private passenger cars, and the reasons for not increasing the tax are still valid. The situation in this case is now extremely tense, and if a solution is not sought quickly, it is feared that it will lead to unexpected events and affect society. In addition to sending a letter to the public association strictly ordering members to maintain order and await resolution, it is appropriate to submit a report to your government for review and approval, to show consideration and avoid causing incidents, which would be in the public interest.</p>
<p>Reply to the Industry: Directly replying, on the 16th of this month, we received a letter regarding the case of requesting exemption from the increased vehicle tax, which was not understood by the authorities. The industry has unanimously suspended business and put forward three requirements, requesting that they be forwarded to the Municipal Government for adoption. The Shanghai Municipal Government has already been informed of the situation. Your association is requested to restrain its members, maintain order, and await resolution. This is of utmost importance.</p>

<p>Starting the Indigenous Cloth Revitalization Movement in Xianshan</p>
<p>Shao Shuangqiu, Dean of the College of Education at Great China University, recently planned to build the 22 Villages project, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. The reporter has recently learned more about its organizational plan and outline of teaching methods, which are disclosed below:</p>
<p>(Organization of Personnel) It will be jointly organized by a number of students from the College of Education of the university, a number of indigenous goods experts, a number of those with elementary school education experience, and a number of local district chiefs and farmers with qualifications.</p>
<p>(Establishment of Venues) Preliminary work will focus on the cotton weaving area of Xu Jiazhai, the planting area of Zhou Jiaqiao, Du Jiazhai, and Jin Jiaxiang, the rattan craft area, the consumer cooperative of Gui Lane, and the experimental elementary school of Mei Yuan. We will do our best to introduce indigenous cloth to restore the economic capacity of local residents, as a preparation for building new villages.</p>
<p>(Teaching Methods) As for teaching methods, each district will be guided by the district chief of that district every day. The district chief will be a student from the Education Department of Daxia University, or another expert hired. All residents in the district, regardless of age, must send someone to attend the class. If there are too many people, the characters will be written on the blackboard. If there are few, they will be replaced with scattered pieces of paper. Each person must learn ten or five characters per day until they can be applied. Then, they will be taught various techniques. The raw materials purchased by the cooperative from the countryside will be distributed to the members for use. After the members receive the raw materials, they must make them into finished products. After completion, they will be handed over to the district chief for safekeeping and re-receiving newly purchased goods for use.</p>
<p>(Improvement of Products) The textiles, which were originally pure white, have now been changed to use patterns and various flowers for easy sale. Recently, the society has also felt that indigenous goods are not thriving and the market is flooded with imported goods. In order to reverse the trend, it is necessary to implement the widespread use of indigenous goods. For the sake of practicality, it is planned to hold a large-scale indigenous goods movement week and establish indigenous goods production cooperatives, cooperative banks, textile training centers, and rural small handicraft training centers to realize the large-scale 22 New Villages.</p>

<p>Pan Yousong, 27 years old, from Jinhua, Zhejiang Province, the owner of the Pansen Da cotton shop at No. 185 Lafayette Road in the French Concession, had opened the shop here just over a month ago. At 4:38 PM yesterday, he suddenly acted carelessly because Pan Yousong's brother smoked a water pipe and the ember fell into a pile of cotton and was not noticed. Later, thick smoke spread everywhere, and the fire had already spread. Pan and others knew that they had caused the disaster and immediately hid. Neighbors who saw the situation immediately called the Songshan Road Fire Brigade, which dispatched many fire trucks to rescue. After the Chinese and Western firefighters worked hard to extinguish the fire, it was finally extinguished at 5:05 PM. As a result, the Pansen Da shop and cotton and other items were burned down. Fortunately, the place was a few bungalows, and the fire was quickly extinguished during the day, so the neighbors were not affected. The arsonist Pan Yousong and his brother had no place to escape, so the patrol station took a shop assistant to the Lujiawan patrol station to await interrogation.</p>

<h3 id="e158">Shanghai West Power Supply Problem: Both Sides Seeking Early Resolution <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Shanghai West area of this city was originally supplied with electricity by the Concession Power Company. However, because this matter is related to the issue of sovereignty, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, in accordance with the established principles of the central government, has repeatedly negotiated with the Concession Power Company. It is understood that there has been considerable progress now. However, since this matter is related to foreign affairs negotiations, the authorities have not agreed to disclose the content of the negotiations. However, since the negotiation time for this matter has been very long, both parties are now planning to seek a solution as soon as possible. When a permanent solution cannot be agreed upon soon, a temporary solution should be formulated as a transition.</p>

<h3 id="e160">Another Drug Manufacturing Facility Discovered Due to a Fire <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Inside No. 920, Wuding Road</p>
<p>The Occupants of the House Fled Suddenly in the Middle of the Night</p>
<p>Left Arson Materials Behind with Malicious Intentions</p>
<p>Cai Bicheng, a Shu person who once served as the county magistrate in Sichuan, came to Shanghai after retiring and rented a newly built four-story mansion of the Da Yao Construction Company on Avenue Edward VII to open a morphine manufacturing plant. Because his work was unusually secretive, no one outside knew about it at first. It was not until the Double Tenth Festival that the engineer refining morphine accidentally acted carelessly, causing a fire. This illegal business was then exposed. Cai then fled after hearing the news and has not been captured. It is a coincidence that Cai's drug manufacturing facility was discovered due to a fire less than ten days ago, and now another drug manufacturing facility has been discovered due to a fire. From this, it can be imagined that the number of drug manufacturing facilities in this city</p>
<p>(Secret Domiciles) are not few. The facility that has now been discovered is located in the house at No. 14, Lane 930, Wuding Road. The house is the property of the Continental Bank and is rented by a person named Xi Pinshen. When renting, a person named Chen Zhong, who lives at No. 378 Avenue de la Gare in the French Concession, acted as guarantor for the bank. Unexpectedly, after renting the house, he still used the house as a drug manufacturing factory, which was not only unexpected to the owner, but also to the residents adjacent to the house and the gatekeeper Wang Shilin, who was never far from Lane 930. All were unable to discover it beforehand. All those engaged in manufacturing or trafficking drugs know that what they are doing is illegal. In addition, the Commander-in-Chief's Office of the Military Commission issued a decree this summer, strictly prohibiting potent drugs, with strict prohibitions. Offenders</p>
<p>(Often Receive the Death Penalty) Therefore, they conceal themselves even more deeply and do not reveal the slightest clue. At about 3:30 AM the day before yesterday (16th), Xi Pinshen suddenly went out with two people from the house, arriving at the entrance of the lane. Because the iron gate there was already locked, Xi ordered the gatekeeper Wang Shilin to open the door, saying that he was going to seek medical attention. Wang believed him and opened the door to let him out, but he waited for a long time and did not see him return. Since he said he was seeking medical attention, he should not have stayed away and not returned. But now he is gone like a yellow crane, and suspicion arose. He rushed into the house at No. 14 to inspect, and checked the upstairs and downstairs. There was no one there, but the boiler that had been set up was burning with flames, and there were also arson materials everywhere, appearing to have</p>
<p>(Suspicion of Arson) He reported it to the Gordon Road Patrol Station in charge. The patrol leader dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to the scene. After extinguishing the fire, they thoroughly inspected the upstairs and downstairs. Four barrels of chemicals were placed upstairs, and three barrels were also placed downstairs, as well as a bag of hydrochloric acid powder, a stove, four water tanks, a box of kerosene, and machinery and tools for manufacturing drugs. They then prepared a list of the items and reported it to the patrol leader, who specially dispatched several detectives to guard the house day and night, and at the same time notified all the patrol stations</p>
<p>(Cracking Down on Fugitives) It is necessary to pursue and arrest the offenders for investigation and handling. Yesterday morning, Zhang Tianyin, the patrol station's lawyer, reported to the First Special District District Court on the circumstances of the patrol station's discovery of this facility. He also stated that the items in the house were now unclaimed, and in order to avoid losses, he requested that they be disposed of. He then submitted a list of items. After Feng Shide, the judge, examined and approved the list, he ordered that the drug raw materials and drug manufacturing equipment should be confiscated, and the remaining items should be handed over to the stolen goods warehouse for safekeeping. If it is inconvenient to store them, they should be sold and stored for collection.</p>
<h3 id="e161">A Skeleton Found at a Workshop <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>No Flesh Remaining, Only White Bones</p>
<p>Truth Unclear, Investigation Underway</p>
<p>According to the National News Agency, Dong Zhaoqian, the director of the Tangqiao Police Station in Pudong, under the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, received a report from Shi Bingsheng, the chief of the Bailianjing Police Station, stating that yesterday afternoon around 5 PM, Cao Changgen, a resident of 103 Bailianjing Street for generations, came to the station to report, "I have a house rented to the Ding Kang Yuan Sauce Garden. I recently heard from a rag-picking child that a corpse was discovered under the floor of the workshop area of the Ding Kang Yuan Sauce Garden. I am reporting this matter for investigation and verification." After verifying the report, Director Dong immediately went to investigate and found that behind the house at 161 Bailianjing, next to the riverbank, there was indeed a long-dead corpse under the floor. All the flesh was gone, leaving only a complete skeleton. Director Dong then ordered Cao Changgen to be brought in for questioning. Cao testified that he runs a tofu shop on this street and that the house was built around 1926 on the Bailianjing beach. There are three single-story houses in total, with two house numbers, 159 and 161. In 1930, he rented house number 161 to Chen Er, a native of Nanhui County, to use as a pig slaughtering workshop. In April 1933, the Chen family rented it to the Ding Kang Yuan Sauce Garden for business. In November of the same year, he rented house number 161 to the Ding Kang Yuan Sauce Garden as a workshop. It was not until 5 PM on the 14th of this month that he heard from a rag-picking child about the discovery of the corpse, hence his report to the police station. He further summoned Li Houyu, the owner of the Ding Kang Yuan Sauce Garden, who stated that the sauce garden had rented the house as a workshop for only a few months and knew nothing about the corpse under the floor. After hearing the testimony, Director Dong ordered Chen Baoming, the local headman, to report to the court for a coroner's examination. He also ordered the landlord, Cao Changgen, to be temporarily released on bail, pending further investigation. Meanwhile, he dispatched officers to investigate the details and await the court's examination to clarify the truth.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Li Yingchang and Others Convicted in Counterfeit Currency Case <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Sentenced to Eight Years, Five Months, Six Months, and One Year Respectively</p>
<p>Li Yingchang, a 40-year-old Yunnan native residing in the pavilion room on the third floor of Hengchang Lane, 3 Beile Road in the French Concession, recently entrusted Liu Guangsheng, a 29-year-old Danyang native who runs a printing business at 24 Zhicheng Lane, Lanwei Avenue in Shanghai, to privately print counterfeit banknotes of the Yunnan Fudian New Bank, each worth 50 copper cents, with the intention of transporting them to Yunnan for circulation. At 12 PM on the 12th of last month, Li placed a receipt book with a square hole cut out in the center and filled it with the counterfeit banknotes, intending to mail them to Yunnan as samples. However, he was apprehended at the entrance of Hengchang Lane by Detective Chief Jin Jiulin of the French Police and detectives Zhou Buguang, Zhang Ziying, Qian Yumin, and others during a patrol. They arrested both Cai and Liu and confiscated 20,500 identical counterfeit banknotes and related correspondence from Cai's house. They also found printing machine models at 71 La Fayette Road, which Liu had rented. It was further discovered that Ji Jinquan, a local resident living at 43 Yongyu Lane, Beile Road, had been acting as an intermediary for Cai Yingchang, receiving and forwarding letters. Consequently, Cai was also arrested and sent to the Second Special District Court for investigation. Subsequent investigation of the letters seized from Cai's house revealed an agreement with Cai Xinmin in Yunnan, whereby Cai Xinmin would send morphine hidden in letters to Shanghai for Cai to sell, and Cai would send counterfeit banknotes to Yunnan for Cai Xinmin to circulate and sell. These letters were received and forwarded by Ji Jinquan. The details of the report to the court and the subsequent investigation have been previously published. The trial has now concluded, and yesterday morning, Judge Cao Jun presided over the first criminal court session and sentenced Li Yingchang to eight years of imprisonment, a fine of 600 yuan, and deprivation of civil rights for ten years. Liu Guangsheng was sentenced to five years and six months of imprisonment, a fine of 200 yuan, and deprivation of civil rights for ten years. Ji Jinquan was sentenced to one year of imprisonment and a fine of 300 yuan. The counterfeit banknotes and related correspondence were confiscated.</p>

<p>First Preparatory Meeting Held Yesterday</p>
<p>The China Women's Temperance Association, to raise funds for 1934-1935, resolved at the fourth board meeting of this year to hold a charity bazaar this autumn. Ms. Wang Xiaoying, Chen Lingyi, Cao Jingyuan, Xiang Wanqing, Wen Siying, Wang Xiuzheng, Liu Qiaoao, and Liu Wang Liming were publicly elected as members of the preparatory committee. Details of these events were reported in the previous newspaper. It is now learned that the committee members held their first preparatory meeting yesterday noon at the Hong Kong Road Bank Club to discuss the procedures for carrying out the event. Ms. Wen Suying, the chairperson, delivered a speech, stating that the Women's Temperance Association is affiliated with the Shanghai Women and Children's Education Center on Xiangyin Road, Jiangwan, which is the first charitable organization in China run by Chinese women themselves. On average, over a hundred people come to the center each month seeking assistance. After careful investigation, those with families are helped to return home, lost individuals are reunited with their relatives, and abandoned individuals are provided with legal protection through legal advisors such as lawyers Li Zhongdao, Wang Yongzhong, Li Shijie, and Wang Qipei. The remaining homeless individuals are sent to the Jiangwan center for care. On average, fifty people reside in the center each month, engaging in part-time work and study, with excellent prospects for the future. However, the center lacks a stable source of funding and must raise funds annually. Members of society have always been sympathetic to the association's work, and it is hoped that this bazaar will be a complete success. The meeting then discussed the location and date of the event, deciding to hold it at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce at the Tianhou Palace Bridge on North Henan Road on November 10th and 11th. It is reported that the program will include the most refined national music, English drama, and songs, dances, and plays that are most suitable for children. Ticket prices are set at five levels: two yuan, five yuan, ten yuan, twenty-five yuan, and fifty yuan.</p>

<p>The Greater American Newspaper reports that when the President Jefferson, a mail ship of the Dollar Steamship Lines, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon (the 16th), agents of the US Consular Police, along with the water police, boarded the ship at the Dollar Wharf and arrested seven seamen from the engine room. This was based on a wireless message sent by Captain Rustad, stating that on October 12th, three hours after the ship departed Yokohama for Shanghai, two seamen were attacked by seamen from the engine room. One was hit in the head with a beer bottle and seriously injured, while the other was bitten. Therefore, yesterday, when the ship docked, none of the seamen were allowed to disembark. The two injured Englishmen identified the perpetrators, leading to the arrest of seven men, who were taken ashore and imprisoned at the Xiamen Road Western Jail. This morning (the 17th), after an investigation by the authorities, two more seamen from the ship were arrested. The case is currently under thorough investigation by the local prosecutor. It is expected that the court will hold a hearing this afternoon. The maximum penalty could be six months of imprisonment and a fine of 500 US dollars. The President Jefferson is scheduled to sail to Hong Kong and Manila tonight and will depart as scheduled. It is reported that replacements have been hired for the nine detained seamen.</p>

<p>A fire broke out at 11:45 AM yesterday at Cao Juxing's copper and tin shop at 291 Chuanxin Street, Laobeimen (Old North Gate) in the city. Flames and thick smoke immediately erupted, engulfing the entire shop and spreading to the upper floor of the Ruixingchang Beijing Goods store across the street.

<p>Request to Try Bao Defu's Case First</p>
<p>Judge Grants Bao Exemption from Attendance Next Time</p>
<p>The case of Lang Zuyin, a Chinese detective from the Old Zha Police Station, who is accused of inciting injury against Cai Yangqi, a Chongming native and former clerk of the Longshun Company cargo shop near the Old Zha Bridge, has been repeatedly heard in the First Special District Court. Bao Defu, the owner of the cargo shop from Pudong, is also a defendant in the case, accused of falsely accusing Cai of theft. However, Lang Zuyin has repeatedly refused to appear in court, claiming to be following orders from his superiors, causing months of delay and preventing the trial from proceeding. The First Special District Court has requested the Ministry of Justice to consult with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with the relevant country, but no resolution has been reached. Yesterday afternoon, the hearing was scheduled to take place again, but only Fan, the wife of the plaintiff Cai Yangqi, and the defendant Bao Defu appeared in court. Lang Zuyin was still absent. Bao's defense lawyer argued that the repeated delays were causing distress to the parties involved and wasting the plaintiff's time. He requested that the part of the case against Bao be tried first. Judge Liu Yugui acknowledged that the lawyer's statement was true but ruled that the case could not be tried separately. He adjourned the hearing to November 19th afternoon, exempting the plaintiff and Bao Defu from attending at that time, and stating that they would be notified when Lang Zuyin could be summoned for trial.</p>

In particular, the solemn arrangement of the hotel's grand restaurant and the elegant furnishings of the rooms, as well as the greatness of its design, are truly beyond my expectations." Ms. Li continued, "The managers of the International Grand Hotel are able to adopt the strengths of Western material civilization. I firmly believe that Chinese hotels will learn from each other and improve themselves to meet the needs of today's tourists."</p>
<p>It is reported that Ms. Li has been in the hotel business for 36 years. She studied under her father in Austria, France, England, Germany, and other countries when she was young.

<p>Sun Qiyu, a 17-year-old girl named Xiao Erzi, who resides in a bungalow on Meizhou Road and is from Funing, has been working in the spinning room of the Zhenhua Cotton Mill on the same road. She has an ordinary appearance. Recently, she fell in love with Zhang Yongfang, a worker at the Huitong Cotton Mill on Lan Road, and they are very close.

Detective Guo Jingbang and a Western detective secretly went to the address and arrested Zhang, along with Sun Xiao Erzi, and brought them to the police station for delivery to the First Special District Court. The daughter said that she was 21 years old and willing to marry Zhang Yongfang. She firmly refused to go home with her father. She was instructed to be temporarily sent to the Jiliang Institute pending verification of her age. The defendant was returned to custody. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Zehan presided over the continued trial in the third criminal court. Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the Shanghai Municipal Council, stated that the police had sent detectives to the spinning department of the Zhenhua Factory and found that worker ID number 723 belonged to Wang Xiuying, a woman from Yangzhou, who was 19 years old. The age, origin, and name of the Sun girl did not match. Sun Xiao Erzi insisted that she was 21 years old and that Wang Xiuying's ID was her alias. She admitted to having reported two years less at the time. According to her father, Sun Qiyu, his daughter was 17 years old and had been promised to a Mr. So-and-so from her hometown as a daughter-in-law. When questioned, the defendant confessed that the matter was entirely Sun Xiao Erzi's own will. He had previously sent a matchmaker to the Sun family to arrange the marriage, but her mother did not agree because she wanted a certain amount of betrothal money, which he could not afford. Sun Xiao Erzi was afraid of being beaten by her parents and still refused to return home. Judge Wu gave the girl a sincere lecture and instructed her father not to beat her too harshly.

<p>To the Editor: On October 15th, I saw a news item in your newspaper titled "Penalties for Smuggling Cigarettes," which is not in accordance with the facts. The Jingzhong brand cigarettes of Qiu Mingde's Shanghai Ningtai Qiaji Cigarette Company are manufactured by our factory. The raw materials, tobacco, casings, trademarks, paper, etc., are entirely provided and used by the company. At the time of delivery, our factory staff, together with the tax bureau's stationed committee member, supervise the packing and affix the tax stamps before leaving the factory for sale. The repacking of old-label waxed paper-wrapped cigarettes is impossible. Moreover, the cigarettes seized were all in the home of Qiu Mingde of Ningtai Company. I was not present at the time, and there was no bringing to the police station or transferring to the court. According to Qiu Mingde's testimony in court, the smuggled loose cigarettes were accumulated by repeatedly requesting loose cigarettes from the Donghai Cigarette Factory for his own use and as samples. He was greedy for small profits and secretly repacked them at home with old waxed paper and sold them on the market. The Donghai Cigarette Factory was completely unaware of this. According to everything Qiu Mingde said, the case is unrelated to our factory and is completely clear. Our factory has been open for ten years and has never engaged in illegal private manufacturing. This time, Qiu Mingde of Ningtai Company committed a violation of the tax bureau's regulations, which implicated our factory and my reputation, which is detestable. We have stopped manufacturing for them. As for the loose cigarettes of Qiu Mingde, according to his testimony in court, they were accumulated by repeatedly requesting them from our factory. This point may also not be in accordance with the facts. Although we can request some for our own use or as samples, it would only be one or two hundred. It is impossible to take an unlimited amount, but there were more than 100 strips or 28,000 cigarettes seized in Qiu Mingde's home. It is possible that he manufactured them privately, otherwise, even if accumulated, there would not be such a huge number. In the interest of reputation, I am writing to request verification and correction to avoid misunderstanding. Sincerely, Shi Shenkang, Donghai Cigarette Factory, October 17th.</p>

<h3 id="e193">Returned Northeast Traveler Discusses the Implementation of Enslavement Education in the Puppet State <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>▲Party ideology materials are strictly prohibited in the curriculum.</p>
<p>▲Schools have decreased compared to before, and a large number of young people are out of school.</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, our compatriots in the Northeast have suffered deeply under the oppression of the puppet government in the puppet state. The Ministry of Culture and Education of the puppet state implemented enslavement education to numb the will of young people. Yesterday, a reporter from the Shanghai News Agency met Mr. Wang, who had returned from the Northeast, at his residence and discussed the situation of education in the puppet state.</p>
<p>(Party Ideology Materials are Prohibited) According to the discussion, the educational policy of the Ministry of Culture and Education of the puppet state, in name, takes emphasizing the Kingly Way and advocating benevolence and righteousness as its banner. It orders schools in various provinces to add the Four Books and the Classic of Filial Piety to the curriculum. In reality, it goes against this. The Ministry of Culture and Education has also issued an order that all materials related to party ideology are strictly prohibited and will be charged with anti-imperialism." The educational departments of Fengtian Province and the South Manchurian Educational Society are currently editing various textbooks, which will then be reviewed and published by the Ministry of Culture and Education. The content is self-evident.</p>
<p>(Reduced Schools and Youth Out of School) The number of schools in the Northeast has now decreased. Before the September 18th Incident, Liaoning Province had 10,350 schools, now only 6,885. Jilin Province had 1,286 schools, now only 449. Heilongjiang Province had 600 schools, now only 432. Xing'an Province had 44 schools, now only 34. The Northeast Special District had 152 schools, now only 143. Rehe had 878 schools, now only 5. Therefore, more than 95% of the youth in the Northeast are out of school.</p>
<p>(Larger Number of Students Studying in Japan) Most schools require Japanese as a compulsory subject, widely establishing Japanese language training centers and encouraging study in Japan. Therefore, in recent years, the puppet state has 107 government-funded students studying in Japan and 109 self-funded students, while only 15 government-funded students and 6 self-funded students are studying in Europe. School fees have increased. Before the September 18th Incident, primary schools cost 7 yuan per year, but now they have increased to 32 yuan per year. There is currently no national university. Recently, someone suggested turning Northeastern University and Jilin University into national universities. The puppet state also collected and reorganized the Wensu Pavilion Siku Quanshu and the collections of Northeastern University and Zhang Xueliang, turning Zhang's private residence into a national library.</p>
<p>(Organizing Youth Groups to Visit Japan) In terms of sports, the puppet state, in addition to holding National Day sports meets last year and this year, orders schools to select and organize student youth groups. The organization is similar to the Boy Scouts. The puppet army is guided and trained by the Japanese, and each province selects youth groups to visit Japan. Their every move is completely a puppet behavior.</p>

<h3 id="e197">A Personal View on Implementing Production Education (5) <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>▲Speech by Director of the Municipal Education Bureau Pan Gongzhan at the Members' Meeting of the Third District Education Association</p>
<p>To make primary and secondary school education break away from the whirlpool of consumption and profit-sharing and transform into an activity of production work, it is natural to reform teaching materials, curriculum, etc., but what is especially important is to have a general enthusiastic, striving, and skilled teaching staff. Speaking of the distribution of the curriculum, although there are now standards set by the ministry, these curriculum standards may not be entirely suitable for practical use or ideal, because the gentlemen who draft and review the curriculum standards may not be experts in researching and compiling the curriculum, but rather experts in a certain subject. Experts in a certain subject often believe that the subject they are good at teaching is the most important, so they request a lot of time for the subject and allocate a lot of time. This is human nature. Therefore, to reform the distribution of the curriculum, we cannot rely solely on a few subject experts who draft and review the curriculum, but rather on teachers in primary and secondary schools who are enthusiastic about research. They regard education as a lifelong career, a career that has a very important relationship with the country and the nation. While studying the selection of teaching materials, they also study the distribution of the curriculum. By pooling their ideas, they will definitely be able to come up with a good reform plan. To be honest, if the central school teachers in Shanghai can truly enthusiastically study the curriculum and teaching materials for the implementation of production education, and one day have a very good plan, it can naturally be used as a reference for the whole country and as a model for the whole country. Why is that? Many people who run education and study normal schools in the interior often come to Shanghai to inspect and "sightsee." If Shanghai does not have new things and good methods to experiment with for people to observe and learn from, and it is still the same as before, always imitating the old, then what glory do we have? Wouldn't it become "seeing but not glorious?" However, this kind of experimentation with new methods and creation of new things in order to make a contribution is really a difficult task. On the one hand, you have to teach students, and on the other hand, you have to bury yourself in research, and then you can transform teaching materials and curriculum onto the great road of production. Surely many people will say, "We are busy from morning to night now teaching, grading homework, and practicing workbooks. To ask us to do research again is tantamount to taking our lives." But we must think of the trend of international oppression and the danger of the national situation, and we must actively carry out the work. At the same time, we must think that the living environment of primary and secondary school teachers in Shanghai is much better than that of their counterparts in other inland areas. For example, in bandit areas, for example, in disaster areas, this is not to be had. Therefore, we should do our best.</p>
<p>Today, by taking advantage of the opportunity of the Third District Education Association's meeting, I can contribute my recent thoughts on education. I cannot but thank the Third District Education Association for giving me this opportunity. I hope that everyone will work together to set a basic principle for reforming education, and everyone will work together to collect materials, research plans, and act as pioneers in reforming education. Only in this way can Shanghai's education be brought back to life. I believe that if Shanghai's education can be brought back to life, it can become popular throughout the country, because everyone is looking to Shanghai for its appearance. As long as Shanghai changes direction, the inland will follow suit. It can almost be said that our future policy is the new trend of primary and secondary school education throughout the country. We should, under the guidance of the Ministry of Education's emphasis on production education, strive for practical facilities and work. The Ministry of Education sees that what the whole country needs is the reform of teaching materials and curriculum, and it will definitely adopt and find ways to meet the needs of the whole country. I hope that you will work hard for production education. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e198">Lu Province Educational Supervisor Permanently Stationed in Districts <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>▲ Trial Implementation of Stationing Inspection Method to Start in Qingzhou and Jining Districts</p>
<p>(Jinan Quick News) The Shandong Provincial Department of Education, considering that in the past, educational supervisors inspected the educational administrative conditions of all districts on a quarterly basis, dividing the province into twelve districts. This was limited by time and made it difficult to fulfill the responsibility of supervision, feeling that it was not perfect. Now, in order to improve supervision efficiency, a pioneering initiative in the national education field is being implemented: a method of permanently stationing educational supervisors in districts for inspection. It has now been decided to first send educational supervisor Wu Hongwang to Qingzhou (Ninth District) and Feng Guangrong to Jining (Third District) for the first year of trial implementation. In the second year, this will be extended to six districts, and in the third year, it will cover all twelve districts in the province. The goal is to make this three-year trial a pioneering undertaking in the education field. On the 16th of this month, Supervisors Wu and Feng will depart simultaneously to begin the trial implementation. It is reported that the method of stationing supervisors in districts has been drafted. As for the educational supervisor inspections this autumn, they will still be carried out as usual, with supervisors of all districts scheduled to depart on the 16th, completing the inspections within two months. Inspections of schools at all levels in Jinan City have now been completed. The details of the method of stationing supervisors in districts are disclosed below:</p>
<p>The stationed district educational supervisor should perform the following duties: (1) General inspection; (2) Special inspection; (3) Matters assigned by the Department's order. Whenever a stationed district supervisor finishes inspecting the education of a county, they should separately convene meetings of the county's educational administrative personnel and teachers and staff of all levels of schools to study improvement matters and report them to the Department for verification and handling. Inspection reports of provincial schools should be submitted separately. When the entire district's education inspection is completed, a suitable location should be selected to convene a meeting of the heads of the Fifth Section or county supervisors of each county to discuss common areas for improvement in the district and submit the discussion conclusions to the Department for verification and handling. At the same time, special inspections should be carried out in counties with better performance in the entire district. Special attention should also be paid to the following three matters: (1) Consolidation of county education funds; (2) Improvement of education administrative efficiency; (3) Improvement of various education undertakings. If there are special circumstances in each county that affect the progress of education, or if a certain type of education is particularly backward, or if the implementation of a certain type of education is not suitable for local needs, or if there are special obstacles encountered in education, special inspections should be carried out.</p>

<p>Former Principal Qiu Hanping Returns to the Position</p>
<p>Qiaoguang Middle School in this city was founded by Qiu Hanping, Ma Canhan, and others in 1931. Qiu served as principal and Ma as vice principal. After more than a year of operation, the school was located in Nanyuan, Xinzha Road, and had hundreds of students, mostly overseas Chinese children. Later, Qiu Hanping resigned as principal due to his law practice and his studies at Soochow and Jinan Universities, which he could not manage at the same time. Ma Canhan took over, and it has been two years since then. Now, Mr. Ma has resigned from the board of directors due to illness. After deliberation by the directors, it was decided that the former principal, Qiu Hanping, should return to the position, so that he can easily get back into the swing of things and the school's affairs can be easily developed. It is said that Qiu Hanping, after being strongly urged by the directors, will arrive at the school to take charge in the near future.</p>

<p>Chu Minyi arrived in Beijing at 8:00 AM on the 16th by the Pingpu Express train and immediately went to the Executive Yuan to attend a meeting. According to Chu's words to reporters, this time representing the Executive Yuan to Tianjin to participate in the North China Games, the round trip took more than ten days. The impression gained was very good. This North China Games was organized by the Hebei Provincial Government and the Tianjin Municipal Government, with a total cost of 460,000 yuan. 360,000 yuan was used to build the venue, and the remaining 100,000 yuan was used to entertain athletes from various places and conference staff. The venue construction is excellent, especially the opening of the entrance is appropriate, so during the conference, there was no crowding when the audience entered. The order was good. The results of the track and field competitions were also particularly advanced, breaking many national and North China records. The spirit and morals of the athletes from all over the world were especially good. There were no disputes during the several days of the meeting. Since the September 18th Incident, the morale of the people in North China has been declining. This time, young people from all over the world gathered in Tianjin and competed fiercely. The people have been greatly encouraged by this, showing a lot of vitality, which is a very meaningful event.</p>
<p>Chu Minyi telegraphed Yu Xuezhong, Zhang Boling, Wang Tao, and others on the 16th to thank them for their hospitality in Tianjin.</p>

<p>▲ Tied 2-2 with Shanghai University</p>
<p>丨 Game Stopped Due to Darkness 丨</p>
<p>丨 Today's Match Against Jiaotong University 丨</p>
<p>The Hangzhou Art School volleyball team has been winning consecutively in Shanghai against Dongya and Datong, as reported previously. Yesterday, they met the Shanghai champion, Shanghai University, and it was expected to be a heated match. However, the results exceeded expectations. This year, besides veteran players, Hangzhou Art School has added two Zhaos and one Huang. The skills of each player and the team's overall coordination have made remarkable progress. At 4 PM, the Shanghai University court was packed with spectators. The match began at 4 PM, with Liu Xuesong of Shanghai University as the referee. The competition was immediately filled with highlights. Veteran players from Shanghai University, such as Lu Kangyuan, who had attended the Far Eastern Games, repeatedly used sharp spikes. However, the front row of Hangzhou Art School was like an impenetrable copper wall. Moreover, Guan Qinghua scored points with cold shots, leading to a stalemate in the score. Later, the two Zhao players from Hangzhou Art School took the lead in spiking and scoring. However, they were repeatedly penalized, resulting in a tie of 20-20. Subsequently, both sides fought hard, making the game even more exciting than before. The third row of Hangzhou Art School, Chen, Zhou, and Huang, repeatedly saved dangerous balls. As a result, the scorekeeper recorded 26-24, with Hangzhou Art School winning the first set. At the beginning of the second set, Shanghai University vowed to counterattack, and Hangzhou Art School did not show any weakness. The score remained within one or two points. In the end, Shanghai University won with a score of 23-21. At the beginning of the third set, Hangzhou Art School gained the right to switch sides after achieving a score of 11-1. Shanghai University worked hard to attack, eventually entering a fierce battle situation at 20-20. The fans cheered wildly. However, Hangzhou Art School, remaining calm, won the third set with a score of 24-22. At the beginning of the fourth set, it was already dark, and both sides had entered a chaotic situation. The Shanghai University cheerleading squad shouted loudly, shaking the ground. Hangzhou Art School, due to its disadvantage in location, lost with a score of 18-21 to Shanghai University. By this time, the lights of thousands of homes were lit, and the game was stopped at a 2-2 tie. The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e218">A Few Dissents on the Form and Legacy of Art <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Ye</p>
<p>In her article "The Form and Legacy of Art," Ms. Xin Ren treats the form of art as the artist's "Sety". She believes that "the primary task of the artist is to extract the content of art from reality, and then use their unique talent to process it artistically. In this process, the artist's greatest effort lies in finding a form that corresponds to the content and can increase the impact of the content. The artist's unique style is used to express the realities they have captured." This point easily leads to the misunderstanding that it is not the content that determines the form, but the writer's style during the process of artistically processing the captured realistic materials. The figurative expression of reality (the essence of phenomena, the phenomenal essence) is undoubtedly a process through the writer's consciousness, that is, it is expressed in the writer's consciousness. But this also involves the artist's skills and the dynamic expression methods, i.e., the role of the form that "increases the impact of the content." Therefore, we can see that the artist's artistic expression form is presented here as something secondary. The primary thing in the artist's artistic production process is the artist's attitude towards reality, i.e., the method or perspective the artist uses when extracting the content of art from concrete, objective reality, and how this material is expressed. If the writer is a strict realist, then the material they extract from reality and the form in which they express it must also be realistic. If a writer extracts a certain essential cross-section from reality, then when the artist processes it artistically, that is, expresses it figuratively, this "how" of expression has an inseparable, lawful relationship with the essential cross-section of the reality being captured. It is not determined by the artist's "whim," otherwise, the artist will fall into the danger of distorting reality or not faithfully expressing it. Overly emphasizing the uniqueness of the writer's style has the same result.</p>
<p>"The "permanence" of works of art is because they contain concrete (figurative) typical facts and characters rooted in reality. And these things are expressed by the artist in a comprehensive form..." The evaluation of the social value of art is based on translating it from artistic expression into sociological expression, and determining its sociological equivalence. But this is only one part of the work on the issue of legacy. The main work here focuses on the form of classical art, i.e., the question of "how to express it." This is precisely the question of creative methods, i.e., how they can provide us with suggestions for creative methods in some areas, that is, the question of re-examining, correctly understanding, "and obtaining new techniques and new creative methods from it," rather than imitating the style of a certain writer.</p>
<p>"We know that artists like Shakespeare, Balzac, Goethe, and Tolstoy had consciousnesses that went against history. However, because they constantly sought out reality, the process of practice gradually eroded and dissolved their worldview..." Like Mr. Ren Baige, Mr. Xin Ren attributes the solution to the contradiction between Balzac, Tolstoy, and others' worldview and creative methods to the results of these writers' creative practice. However, in reality, I think it is more due to social changes. Balzac and Tolstoy's consciousness went against history. Because of this, they never fully grasped the unity of worldview and creative method, and this is precisely what restricted their development and manifested in the wavering consciousness in their works. However, this still does not prevent them from becoming realists.</p>
<p>Mr. Xin Ren believes that "the "permanence" of works of art is because they contain concrete (figurative) typical facts and characters rooted in reality." This is precisely to say whether the reality embodied in works of art has historicity and sociality. It uses concrete images to embody the reality of a particular class in history (note, it does not embody the so-called "eternal human nature," i.e., the so-called "supra-historical" human, (supreme emotion)). Therefore, in this respect, it also has significance no less than form. When we speak of the content of a work, we are not only referring to the specific realistic material embodied in it, but also to the "synthesis" that the specific realistic material has expressed after its artistic value has been completed through form, that is, not only is its theme realistic, fully expressing the essence of a particular historical class, and possessing the highest degree of positivity, but its form also fully exploits the positivity of the theme, making its theme more powerfully expressed in form. Here, we not only discover the determining role of content, but also discover the positivity of form, and further confirm the inseparability of the two. The realist creative methods of classical writers are not only the expression forms of classical writers' realism, that is, the question of descriptive techniques, but also the question of how classical writers extracted their material from reality and expressed it. Therefore, this relates to the entirety of the classical writers' creative methods, rather than limiting the legacy issue to the imitation or extraction of the "style" of classical writers because "since the thoughts of classical great art are unrelated to us, then what can be our legacy should be in the form." Because what is expressed in classical works is not only the thoughts that we should not want, but also embodies the living historical truth, and the greatness of how classical writers grasped this reality and further expressed this creative method.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can say that Mr. Xin Ren's limitation of the legacy issue to the form of classical writers, to the point of their style, is making the issue too narrow. (End)</p>

<p>— Yang Juan</p>
<p>The ship slowly comes to a stop. The muddy yellow waves on the river, beating with the leisurely rhythm of the August river wind, rush over with a "la li hua la" sound, and then ebb away.</p>
<p>On the deck of the small ferry picking up passengers, I begin to see the wings of the Statue of Liberty, exchanging the gentle gaze from two years ago. The setting sun, nearing dusk, passionately kisses the spire of the twenty-five-story building with the love of a witch.</p>
<p>The longing under the bright sky of the southern country, the yearning at the seaside, all dissipate and merge into a joyous scene when I land. The streets are filled with speeding cars, circulating like the city's blood vessels, flowing along the smooth asphalt roads like water.</p>
<p>Two people smoking Abdulla cigarettes with the flavor of the southern waters, dragging their melancholy figures, under the eaves painted by the setting sun, a conversation floats up with the lingering smoke:</p>
<p>Life is really boring, it's been almost two years.</p>
<p>That's right, graduated, what are you going to do?</p>
<p>As long as I have food, anything is fine, but I still have no idea.</p>
<p>After speaking, he frowned ruefully, and exhaled a puff of smoke. I don't want to say any more. Aren't we all burdened by the weight of life?</p>
<p>The windmill-style Dutch village, the quiet lights soaking in the surroundings, we drink strong coffee. The low walls are inlaid with Don Quixote-style medieval knight portraits and green wave patterns. The weary traveler, given this warm and gentle caress, drowsily thinks of sleep; thinks of the past, and a happy future.</p>
<p>From the dark sea where red and purple lights change interactively, I use whiskey to prick my nerves. The smooth surface, like gentle waves, is inlaid with the faces of various night women, some unfamiliar faces. Time slips away so quickly, the dream of youth is short, and it is pushed away in an instant. I am stunned for a moment by the melancholy of the smoke, then I walk away blowing an outdated whistle.</p>
<p>It is dusk again, in the blue steel of the Shanghai-Ping United Transportation at the North Station, when the flags are waved and the tears of the farewell crowd fall. I turn my head and stare at the fading figure on the platform, gradually hidden in the crowd, and say dreamily, "Good night, Shanghai!"</p>
<h3 id="e220">Autumn's Heart <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Cunren</p>
<p>The era of autumn gives people an autumn heart.</p>
<p>If it were winter, even though the wind and snow are continuous, and the hibernating insects endure the brutal attacks, there is still the hope that spring is coming soon; but autumn, facing what is coming soon, is the winter season of wind and snow!</p>
<p>Autumn not only makes people melancholic, but also makes people depressed; it is a climate without love, without warmth, without hope!</p>
<p>This era is just like autumn: without love, without warmth, without hope. The era of Werther is past, the era of Rudin is also past, and now, it is the era of Sanin.</p>
<p>From struggle to disillusionment, disillusionment and then struggle again, the forward-moving heart encourages young people to straighten their spines, but in the end, they still get an emptiness, that is autumn, this era.</p>
<p>It is said to open our eyes and see that this era is winter, and spring is coming soon; however, in words, I can also say it, and looking at the wilderness, reality is precisely the autumn of falling leaves.</p>
<p>In the autumn of falling leaves, some people love her white clouds, some people love her bright moon, and some people leisurely admire the chrysanthemums under the eastern fence, but I am foreseeing the winter season of wind and snow coming soon.</p>
<p>Autumn's heart, a melancholic and depressed heart, a lonely and trembling heart!</p>
<h3 id="e221">Sister Pearl (Part 2) <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Xue Zhao</p>
<p>After graduating from girls' elementary school, we separated. My family sent me to a girls' middle school far from my hometown. I never saw Sister Pearl again. Her shadow only appeared when I returned to my hometown during vacations, passing the post office, passing Chunhui Hall, and then sadly reflected once again in my mind. Her situation, everything about her, was completely blurred to me. I only obtained some imaginative information from inaccurate rumors. But I knew that her relationship with my cousin was still very good. My cousin and I had long since cut off contact, but after she went to school in Shanghai, she had many unsatisfactory things happen, which everyone in our hometown knew.</p>
<p>When I came back for the New Year and summer vacations, my mother always told me about the things that had happened during my time away from home, especially about my former female classmates.</p>
<p>"...Oh, speaking of Sister Pearl, she's already engaged."</p>
<p>"No, she's already married," my sister-in-law corrected from the side.</p>
<p>After that, all I knew was that she was married to a doctor who had studied at a medical school in Hangzhou, but he didn't practice medicine. He lazed around at home all day long and had a big opium addiction. The young couple rented a house from the Wang family at the back of the Zhou house. Because Sister Pearl's father-in-law was in business in Xiashi, her mother-in-law had just died, and her little sister-in-law had just gotten married. Then, Sister Pearl gave birth to a baby boy.</p>
<p>This time, I hadn't been back to my hometown for more than four years. By chance, at a fellow villager's wedding banquet, I met my cousin.</p>
<p>"How come you're also in Beiping?" She looked a little surprised to see me, and also a little ashamed, and said.</p>
<p>"Yes," I said, "We only have the opportunity to meet today." Suddenly, the shadow of her sworn sister flashed in my mind.</p>
<p>It had been fourteen years since my cousin and I left our hometown girls' elementary school, and this was the first time we had met.</p>
<p>"How is Sister Pearl now?" I hesitated for a moment, but finally asked.</p>
<p>"She's dead!" My cousin answered with a somewhat embarrassed look.</p>
<p>"Ah!" I couldn't help but shout. Her answer was really too far from what I had expected in my heart.</p>
<p>My surprise and sadness were probably involuntarily revealed. My cousin looked at me, her expression no longer as embarrassed as before, but rather calm and friendly, and said to me:</p>
<p>"I don't know what she died of. New Brother said it was tuberculosis."</p>
<p>"New Brother?"</p>
<p>"That's Sister Pearl's husband. He's studying medicine."</p>
<p>"Ah!"</p>
<p>After a moment, I asked:</p>
<p>"Isn't he an opium smoker?" I couldn't help but express my regret for Sister Pearl: "How could she want to marry an opium smoker?"</p>
<p>"Yes! I thought so too," then my cousin began to tell me at length about Sister Pearl's marriage to this opium fiend:</p>
<p>"They had been corresponding long before they got married. When people came to propose marriage, Sister Pearl's stepmother was very good and said that she didn't want to send Pearl into a den of opium, and refused. But Sister Pearl herself insisted that she had to marry him. They had already been corresponding with each other at that time. It was New Brother's sister who arranged it. I advised her not to marry this person, advised her to sell her jewelry, and also use this money to redeem books and learn some skills for independent living, and even if she wanted to marry, she could marry someone better than this. Mr. Li also came to advise her like this—Mr. Li is the female gymnastics teacher that my second brother loves, and another sworn sister of Pearl Sister—she said that she was willing to marry him, and she didn't care about the opium smoking. If she abandoned him, it would be too unjust... Actually, at that time, it was impossible for her to study. All of her jewelry had been swindled away by New Brother's sister to pay for New Brother's opium smoking."</p>
<p>After hearing these words, I couldn't help but feel a chill in my heart. The image of Sister Pearl who only knew how to "laugh it off" flashed in my mind, a happy Sister Pearl. However, thinking about it carefully, I felt that this kind of thing did not fall from the sky, but could be said to be made by Sister Pearl's personality. I remembered that when she and I were the best of friends, I often talked to her about going to school. I had a great desire for knowledge. But she, on the other hand, just wanted to get some things to eat, wear, and play with, and play mahjong. Other than that, she loved to read novels like "The Wobei," "The Rouge Tower," and "The Pearl Pagoda"... "If I abandon him, it would be too unjust..." How much she wanted to learn to be the heroine in this kind of novel! But what was the result? Thinking of this, I couldn't help but sigh deeply.</p>
<p>My cousin continued to narrate the story of Sister Pearl and them:</p>
<p>"When she was giving birth, I saw Sister Pearl once. She was fine at that time. Later, when I went to her house again, she was already sick. New Brother said it was tuberculosis. He also said that she wouldn't live for more than a year..."</p>
<p>"Then, when he saw her approaching death, didn't he think of a way to help her?"</p>
<p>My cousin didn't say anything, seemingly also immersed in this question.</p>
<p>Now, every time I go to the post office, passing Chunhui Hall, I can't help but have the shadow of Sister Pearl appear in my mind, and it also triggers a lot of consistent associations. My fourth brother, since marrying a wealthy woman, has been immersed in gambling and has completely degenerated. I thought that if my fourth brother had married Sister Pearl, he might not have degenerated, and Sister Pearl might not have died so early... However, at the end of the association, a dark curtain covered the image of Sister Pearl, who was always "laughing it off" and happy, and a sense of desolation was added to my melancholy heart.</p>

<h3 id="e222">Mr. Township Chief (28) <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Renshu</p>
<p>"One case is not settled, and another case arises! I won't be the Township Chief anymore! Don't hold me back! Don't hold me back!" Mr. Feng Wen shook his head, begging for mercy. He immediately felt that the taste of "attention" and "raise the gun" was not easy to savor. And the fact that his wife looked down on him and left him to work outside was also for a reason. "New mud, met with the intercalary sixth month," wasn't it?</p>
<p>This time, Dong Sheng, with his crippled hand, was so scared that his face was the color of mud. After a moment of stunned silence, he fled out the back door.</p>
<p>Kaiyang, Ah Xian, Ah De... these people seemed unable to comprehend, standing there in a daze. As if it was they themselves, not Ah Zhao, who were killed by the bandits—no, by "numbers," by "fate."</p>
<p>"Amitabha! Kill the bandits a thousand times, cut the bandits ten thousand times!" Kaiyang's mother, with tears and snot, comforted Ah Zhao's wife. A face full of mud mixed with tears and snot flowed.</p>
<p>After finishing his last cup of wine, Old Mu Ren dragged his sandalwood tree-sized crazy foot and stepped out the door.</p>
<p>"Damn it! What kind of world is this!"</p>
<p>He cursed as he left.</p>
<p>Mr. Dasheng shook his head. However, he still persuaded Ah Zhao's wife, saying:</p>
<p>"Ah Zhao's wife! Don't make a scene anymore. People are dead, they can't come back to life. For the funeral arrangements, all expenses, the village will start donating tomorrow. In the future, I will also ask the county for a plaque, saying that Ah Zhao was a martyr, who died for the Second World War. Then you will gain both fame and fortune!"</p>
<p>"But, I want Ah Zhao! I want my sky! Sky... Sky!..." Then Ah Zhao's wife sat up on the ground and cried out in a long voice, with rising and falling tones!</p>
<p>"Damn it! What kind of world is this!"</p>
<p>Old Crazy Mu Ren, dragging his big crazy foot far away, also dragged this curse far away. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e223">Confidence in National Products <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Everyone knows that revolution is not as good as reforming the heart, and material construction is not as good as psychological construction. The issue of national products is also like this. It is better to have faith in national products than to promote them. If one is forced to use national products, it is better not to force it. I do not approve of some people using national products for the sake of face, and I disapprove even more of some people using national products for fear of being talked about. For all Chinese people, using Chinese goods is everyone's duty, everyone's natural gift, flowing completely from true nature, emanating completely from the bottom of one's heart, without the need for any coercion or disguise. The general unscrupulous merchants, hanging up a sheep's head to sell dog meat, filling the national products with goods from the enemy or foreign countries, are truly unforgivable and their crimes are innumerable.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Jingwei recently said at the opening of the National Products Company on the Double Tenth Festival: "People who buy national products should not buy them to compare with foreign goods. Even if Chinese goods are not good, they should feel that they are better than foreign goods." These words completely arouse the confidence of our people in national products, and are truly thorough, clear, and flavorful.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang also said: "People who buy goods should carefully and prudently choose the goods, and not be fooled by others. Those who sell goods should choose items that are perfect, and take the idea of rights lightly." In short, for the sake of national products, both the seller and the buyer must have a kind of confidence, which develops into strength, and cannot be shaken by any ideological movement.</p>

<h3 id="e224">Urgently Needed "National Goods Education" <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>What is "National Goods Education"? My answer is that "National Goods Education" is a new type of education centered on revitalizing national goods. It uses educational methods to enlighten people's understanding of national goods and impart practical production knowledge and skills, so that people across the country can feel the importance of promoting national goods and then put their felt tasks into practice. In the educational setting, it aims to drastically change our inherent mentality of worshiping foreign goods, achieve economic self-sufficiency, balance our own production and consumption, and base the prosperity of the entire nation on this.</p>
<p>Therefore, what we should pay attention to here is that in the past, our efforts to promote national goods have always focused on the concrete promotion of production movements, purely relying on subjective ideals to enrich the national goods themselves and to confront rampant foreign goods. In this way, the construction of public psychology and how to use a great educational force to influence and cultivate have always been neglected. This is undoubtedly the most regrettable thing in the past.</p>
<p>Therefore, at present, standing at the point where the "craze for foreign goods" among our people has reached its peak, the importance of implementing national goods education has naturally become our most urgent task. Furthermore, in my opinion, its implementation path can be roughly divided into two standpoints: schools and society. The former is a place for cultivating young people across the country, while the latter is a field for the general public. The discussion is divided as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Schools　Schools are places for cultivating the knowledge class. They are inherently responsible for inspiring children's patriotic psychology and cultivating students' noble character. So, at this time, how should we strive to expound the spirit of national goods and cultivate students? The compilation of national goods teaching materials and the promotion of national goods slogans are naturally the main aspects of national goods education.</p>
<p>2.  Society　The scope of implementing "National Goods Education" is certainly not limited to students in schools alone. The general public in society also has the same urgency. The holding and establishment of past national goods exhibitions and national goods display halls are also a type of "National Goods Education." However, how should we use new methods in the future to increase their promotional capabilities and achieve the effect of "getting twice the result with half the effort"?</p>
<p>In short, in the process of national goods revitalization and production increase, the significance and mission of "National Goods Education" cannot be ignored. I sincerely hope that those engaged in the national goods movement will quickly pay attention to this point and start implementing it. Then, the day of its success will surely be the day of national economic and national industrial prosperity and revitalization!</p>

<h3 id="e225">Everyone Take Responsibility <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>This year is the National Women's National Goods Year, known throughout the country. As Chinese women, we should certainly practically use national goods. Even our male compatriots should especially practically purchase and use national goods to help women promote and produce national goods, so that China's great national goods movement can achieve great development, great success, and excellent results with the joint efforts of men and women standing on the same front.</p>
<p>However, while the theory is like this, what is the actual performance? Alas! It is truly enough to make us heartbroken and indignant. During the Women's National Goods Year, newspapers frequently publish news of import surpluses of various goods. I will now roughly record some of them below to prove that I am not mistaken:</p>
<p>(1) The imports of porcelain and chewing gum in July totaled 697,559 yuan.</p>
<p>(2) The import of felt hats, based on the statistics for July alone, reached 85,636 gold units, equivalent to 170,844 national currency units, a two-fold increase compared to the same period last year.</p>
<p>(3) The import surplus of cigarettes nationwide in August totaled 40,000,000 yuan, meaning that almost every Chinese compatriot had to bear an import surplus of one yuan.</p>
<p>(4) The import surplus of lace used by women to make clothes in the first half of the year was 292,195 gold units, equivalent to 577,962 national currency units.</p>
<p>(5) The import surplus of children's toys, according to the statistics for the past eight months, was 664,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(6) ...</p>
<p>Enough! The statistics of just a few items have already made us surprised and amazed? At the same time, they have made us very heartbroken. Alas! The result of the Women's National Goods Year is like this. This is not only a disgrace to the women's community but also a great humiliation to the entire nation, which is a very heartbreaking thing.</p>
<p>Now, more than two-thirds of the time for the Women's National Goods Year has passed. In the remaining seventy or eighty days, how should we strive to establish a belief in using national goods and a determination to produce national goods, and try to wash away this enormous humiliation? This responsibility should not only be shouldered by women, but we men should also practically take it up!</p>
<h3 id="e226">Popularizing the Promotion of National Goods <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>"The import of women's cosmetics in the first six months of this year was more than 800,000 yuan."</p>
<p>"Several ladies in this city who are enthusiastic about promoting national goods are collecting various national goods for daily use to exhibit and promote in the inland areas."</p>
<p>These two news items are absolutely contradictory. It is truly both joyful and fearful. There is no need to talk about fearful things, because "past events are like death"? As long as we make efforts in the future to mend the fold after the sheep is lost, there will be considerable effectiveness. So I will talk about the methods of national goods exhibitions and promotions, just for the reference of all patriotic ladies.</p>
<p>People in the intellectual class certainly know that promoting national goods is currently the only key to saving the country. However, ordinary low-level people do not care about national goods or not. As long as the goods are good and the price is right, they will scramble to buy them. There are many such low-level people in cities or inland areas. When we promote national goods, we should not only focus on the "bourgeoisie" but also pay attention to these low-level people. Therefore, the method of publicity must be studied carefully.</p>
<p>For low-level people, "text is far inferior to pictures; pictures are inferior to singing; singing is inferior to drama." This is generally accepted. When promoting national goods in inland areas or exhibiting national goods, simply relying on a few leaflets or borrowing a place to display the goods like a museum, the effect is almost zero. I think that before talking about promoting national goods, first borrow a public place to perform dramas, inviting the general public to visit. The drama should naturally depict the current poverty and weakness of the country and the harms of using foreign goods. After the public understands, then turn to the main topic, persuading the public to purchase and use national goods, and also tell them about the national goods and trademarks, so that they remember them firmly. In addition, compose some popular and simple songs and teach them to sing. If they can sing them and often say them, their minds will have another engraving. As for eye-catching pictures, they also have considerable effectiveness, so it is okay to hang them in the venue or print them into leaflets and distribute them to the public. This approach is like giving an injection of morphine to people in the intellectual class, which can also make them feel excited. For low-level people, it is a great public education to make them understand everything!</p>
<p>Newspaper advice and written publicity are effective in other countries. As for our noble country, there are really too few literate people; the number of people who read newspapers is also not as widespread as in other countries, so using this type of method is simply like "performing with a stone mortar on your head," a lot of effort with little return. As for performing dramas and singing songs, that is the most palatable to the general public. I think it is worth trying. It will definitely not fail; perhaps there will be unexpected gains, who knows?</p>
<p>National Goods Snapshot</p>
<h3 id="e227">Retrospect of the Taixian National Exhibition <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Yun Sun</p>
<p>Taixian is a small city located in the remote northern part of Jiangsu Province. This year, with the arrival of autumn, when the red leaves had not yet fallen, the party, government, business, and other organizations initiated a national goods exhibition. The scope was naturally small, only to call the attention of the men and women of the entire county! Its achievements and impressions, taken as a proportion of the entire country, are naturally just a drop in the bucket. However, just in terms of what cities are doing with "National Goods Year" and "Women's National Goods Year," and many national goods exhibitions, I am afraid that people in inland areas, even those who are active day and night in cities, cannot even translate the meaning of these words. We know the common sayings that "accumulated fur can make a robe" and "united will can build a city." The national goods movement must penetrate into the people and can absolutely not achieve long-term and far-reaching results by promoting it in a biased manner. Therefore, this small county national exhibition is worth writing about for retrospect. The address was in the Town God Temple, with two tall cypress arches erected at the east and west gates; another cypress arch was also built at Zhongshan Gate, which is busy with shops. The passersby had never seen anything so rare in their eyes, and the people who stopped to watch were shoulder to shoulder. Inside the venue, five or six courtyards of the Daxiong Hall-style houses, each with a huge courtyard, had national goods shops opening on the left and right sides of the long corridor. Every day, the tourists truly emptied the streets to come and watch, a grand event that the small city had never seen before. The giants of silk and cloth shops such as Tianchengtai, Guangtai, and Tianfu on Pozi Street occupied a large position in the venue, with temporary markets set up; rattan chair shops, medicinal material shops, cigarette shops, and porcelain bowl shops were also central displays on the spot. Cigarettes and rattan utensils were still able to attract the audience, because they had some knowledge of "showcases" and knew how to put some effort into the word "exhibition"; silk and cloth seemed too conservative; there was no new expression, giving visitors a deep impression. In Taixian, this groundbreaking great movement was a new record in the county annals. County Magistrate Zhang was still afraid that the county residents would not be enthusiastic enough to visit, so he specially hired a troupe of Hui opera and used the old theater of the Town God Temple. Everyone thought that there were free plays (without spending money) to watch, so there were always more than ten thousand people every day, actually squeezing the Town God Temple to the point where water could not leak through. I imagined that the groups hosting the exhibition would truly use the season. This new autumn is the harvest season for the general small bourgeoisie in the inland areas, and even the tenant farmers in the countryside can also have some breathing room these days to discuss marriages and add new clothes. Therefore, the national exhibition made a small fortune. I very much hope that the party and government agencies in various counties can emulate and follow up, which is a relatively practical dawn for the future of national goods.</p>
<h3 id="e228">National Goods Exhibition in Pudong District <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Qibai</p>
<p>In the commercial areas of Shanghai, we know that several "National Goods Exhibitions" and temporary "National Goods Markets" have already been held. In fact, even now, there are already several fixed markets in the commercial areas of Shanghai that sell national goods, such as the one at the Tianhougong Bridge City Chamber of Commerce, the one at the original site of the Nanshi Social Affairs Bureau, and the "Penglai City Market," etc. However, in industrial areas, residential areas, and rural areas near commercial areas, large-scale "temporary national goods markets" or "national goods exhibitions" are still rare.</p>
<p>The creation of this "Shanghai Pudong District National Goods Exhibition" cannot but make us extremely happy. Why? Because to recover rights and interests, the most important thing is to revitalize industry; to promote national goods, the most important thing is to expand publicity. However, if we want to expand publicity in terms of time and space, then the only way is to set up "National Goods Exhibitions" everywhere. The reason why there is a "National Goods Exhibition" in Lannidu, Pudong this time is: firstly, in terms of location, although it is separated by the Huangpu River, the number of "foreign goods stores" is indeed alarming, so holding a "National Goods Exhibition" is indeed necessary; secondly, in terms of the level of school education and social education, it is not as good as Shanghai by far, so there is indeed a need to publicize the habit of purchasing and using national goods; thirdly, Lannidu is a factory area, and the population density is naturally greater than in other places; therefore, it is even more necessary to hold a "National Goods Exhibition."</p>
<p>This year, the author is teaching in Pudong and is even closer to this "National Goods Exhibition." I heard that in addition to exhibiting various national goods, the parties concerned have also invited students from local primary and secondary schools to hold "National Goods Speech Contests"; one is to encourage students to recognize the purchase and use of national goods; the other is to have the nature of publicity, which is a perfect method.</p>
<p>But I have a few hopes at the end, written below, and I hope that the parties concerned will adopt them:</p>
<p>1.  The exhibition locations should be many, such as Gaoqiao, Wusong, Longhua, Jiangwan, etc., which all need to be held from time to time, or a fixed "National Goods Market" should be set up.</p>
<p>2.  The exhibition time should be long, such as one month, two months, or even three months, half a year, etc.; in this way, the impression can also be deep.</p>
<p>3.  Make the audience or buyers come in a steady stream and, moreover, increase their interest.</p>
<p>4.  Use students and encourage students to do various effective publicity.</p>
<p>5.  Encourage the introduction and publicity of buyers and audiences.</p>
<p>6.  In the future, when holding this type of exhibition, there must be large-scale publicity with written and pictorial explanations.</p>
<p>7.  As much as possible, solicit the opinions of buyers and audiences on the improvement of national goods after purchase and use, so as to improve the goods to the best of their quality.</p>
<p>Are the above seven points appropriate? Please correct me.</p>
<p>National Goods News of the Week</p>
<p>(1) The Ministry of Industry replied to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce that imported goods must not use national goods trademarks, and violators should be prosecuted for deceiving the public.</p>

<h3 id="e229">Wang Zirong (Part 2) <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>"...It's over, I, Wang Zirong, am a person with nothing. Of course, there is nothing to talk about, but my three-inch incorruptible tongue still exists and can be used to give verbal publicity to you all. Everyone, take a look at the current situation. It is truly pitiful. Not only have the four northeastern provinces not been recovered, but they are even more dangerous in spying on Pingjin. On the market, their overproduced goods are increasing day by day. This cannot be blamed on others. We should blame our own badness. After the September 18th Incident did not count, there came a closer January 28th Incident. The booming sounds of cannons and bombs cannot wake them from their dreams..." I was also in that open space, and when I heard Wang Zirong say this, I did not want to listen anymore.</p>
<p>This was the September 18th Incident of the 21st year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>"...Year after year passed, and when I rethink my speech after the September 18th Incident in the 20th year, I am truly ashamed to an unknown degree. Now they are still advancing step by step, and overproduced goods are still being vigorously promoted to my country's market. I really think that the Chinese people are so brave. They are not scared of guns, and they are not afraid of bombs. The general public who buys their goods certainly will not understand that buying their goods is buying guns and bombs to eat! We, the sober people! Isn't this a path to suicide? So from beginning to end, regardless of whether anyone listens to my words, I always take persuading people to use national goods as my duty. After all, one person's strength is limited. The success of a world-shattering great cause is not simply done by the hands of one or two people. Therefore, there is a saying that among thousands of people walking, one person leads the way. If the leader only runs forward, and the people behind are sluggish and do not move a step, and even retreat, this is really helpless..." I heard Wang Zirong say this in that open space.</p>
<p>This was the September 18th Incident of the 22nd year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>"...People in a dream are certainly confused, but smart people have become people in a dream. Try flipping through the current newspapers. There are seven major traitors selling them in large quantities. So-and-so company purchased a large amount of so-and-so goods, and there are even alarming huge numbers reported by the customs. There are endless kinds of news. You think that people who do this kind of thing would not do it if they were truly dreamers! They are so fearless of dangers and bombs, just for a few dollars. For a few dollars, they do everything regardless. These are truly the parasites of the country and the thieves of society. If these people are not eliminated for a day, the country will be unfortunate for a day. We have no weapons in our hands, so of course we cannot do anything to them..." Wang Zirong was still giving a speech in that open space as usual, and later continued:</p>
<p>"...After all, people's hearts have not completely died. There are nine famous national goods manufacturers who have united and created the Nine Factory National Goods Temporary Market on the anniversary of the September 18th Incident. The great China National Goods Company was continuously produced after the September 18th National Goods Temporary Market. This year is the third session on the second anniversary of the September 18th Incident. The September 18th National Goods Temporary Market is also opening for the second session. The Nanchang is attached to the China National Goods Company. They are working hard on national goods publicity without any slack. This is worthy of admiration..."</p>
<p>This was the September 18th Incident of the 23rd year of the Republic of China.</p>

<p>— Du Le</p>
<p>Glycerin has a wide range of uses, and many finished products have a close relationship with it. However, my country could not manufacture it on its own in the past, and the glycerin used was all foreign goods. Because the cost was high, the manufactured goods often could not compete with foreign goods!</p>
<p>Since the Wuzhou Second Factory created the domestically produced Planet Brand glycerin, business has been very good. Major industrial factories such as China Chemical, Yonghe, Family, Sincere, Meixing, and Huacheng in this city are all purchasing as much as possible. This is of course because it is cheap and of good quality. Recently, there has been even more gratifying news, that is, a German foreign firm has ordered 50 tons of Planet Brand glycerin from Wuzhou, preparing to send it to Mumbai, India. It is said that they will continue to order. Domestically produced scientific raw materials can be sold to foreign countries. Of course, this Planet Brand glycerin is a new example, and at the same time, its ingredients and value can be imagined.</p>

<h3 id="e231">Research on the Subsequent Progress of Native Cloth Improvement and Promotion <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Xiawen</p>
<p>Since the Taijiabao Relief Association promoted the improvement of Taicang native cloth, the process can be divided into three stages: (1) Persuading weavers to change the width of the fabric and lengthen the shuttle. (2) After the finished product is completed, explore whether there is a market, and display it for trial sales everywhere. (3) Find out the opinions of buyers, which colors are the most fashionable; whether the dimensions are appropriate. Since the autumn of the 21st year, after starting to improve from Huangjing Township in Taicang, after many days and research by comrades, the three problems have been gradually resolved until this spring. (1) The villagers originally regarded weaving cloth as a sideline, but because the sales of native cloth were cut off, they had to wait for death. Now that they can lend yarn to weave cloth and earn wages to make a living, no matter how wide the fabric is or how long the shuttle is, once the improvement is advertised, there is no need to persuade them. They come one after another, taking yarn to weave cloth. This first problem is the easiest to solve. (2) Since we started to improve native cloth, all comrades have been worried about the difficulty of sales. If there is no way to sell it, then the finished goods will pile up like a mountain, and if one piece is worth one yuan, ten thousand gold can be used up immediately. However, we have great courage, thinking that cloth is incomparable to other things. Even if there is no way to sell it, we can use it ourselves if there are goods in stock. So we tried our best to promote it, and Mr. Pan Yangyao introduced it for sale at the National Goods Market. The first time, the appetite was still good, but after two or three times, the stomach was dull and sales were slow, and the price of goods fell sharply. Later, we discussed with the Native Cloth Store of the Shanghai County Farmers Education Center to sell it on consignment, but it was not very prosperous either. However, this rural native cloth has been able to be displayed in the Shanghai market and worn by patriotic men and women in Shanghai. We are very fortunate in our hearts, thinking that sales are guaranteed, but sooner or later. This spring, a relative returned from Haizhou, who is patriotic and took the responsibility of selling native cloth to the Longhai area. He took all the goods accumulated in Taicang and Shanghai and went away. In less than three months, all the goods were remitted back, urging to send the goods and saying, "The more the better." But because the stock has been exhausted, the weaving households have temporarily stopped due to the busy farming season, and there is no way to cope with it. From then on, the second problem can be solved. (3) For Shanghai tailors, ant seat flower has been tired of the old, and need to change patterns more; colors need to use the shade Stanlin does not fade and is bright, the most appropriate, the size of the cloth, with a foot four inches wide, used to make women's cheongsam, can be uniquely tailored without hemming, the shuttle is two feet three inches, || can make two cheongsams. The selling price of each piece is one yuan and four corners, then each piece is only seven corners, and the economy is more cost-effective. As for Haizhou, sales are not the same. The soil cloth of Changshu Taicang (Huangjing) is only eight inches wide. Now the width is one foot three inches, the sleeves are not found, and the trouser legs are not very angled, which is already suitable. As for the color, it can still be casual now, but after a year or two, I am afraid it will have to be improved ||| The third problem can also come to an end. Therefore, three problems have been solved; and then further research is done. In our Taicang twenty-five townships, more than half of them can weave cloth. Now we start from Huangjing Township; and choose 40 weaving households in one township to try out, lending yarn to weave cloth. Each household weaves one piece a day, and one month produces 1,200 pieces. The total cost needs 1,640 yuan. If it is sold to Haizhou, the cost will be more than 4,800 yuan to settle the account at the festival. The machine continues to spin and weave, and another batch of goods must be prepared, then the capital will be nearly 10,000. If it is expanded to the whole county, then it will be added again and again. At present, the finished goods can not lose money. If you eat the village money, add the interest on the demolition, then the native cloth will have to increase in price, and the sales will be affected, then the cost will become a big problem. ||| The Haizhou area. Four hundred miles around, this is a prosperous area for the sale of foreign cloth. Now, under the influence of promoting national goods and publicity, patriotic enthusiasm is surging. Occasionally, when you see the improved native cloth on the market, you are enthusiastically buying it. Therefore, the shipments from Taicang Huangjing; together with the products from Shanghai Zhuanqiao, are continuously sent, which is not enough for the sales of Haizhou alone: In fact, patriotic men and women in Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Beiping, Tianjin, Shandong and other places who use native cloth are definitely not a few. As long as there is a solution to the economic problem, it is not difficult to sell it widely; as for the width, color, and improvement methods, it is impossible to do it all at once, but it is also impossible not to study. The fabric of the hand-woven fabric is only one foot four or five inches wide. If it is changed to a pulling shuttle, the width can be two feet. The width of two feet is the most suitable for the Shanghai market. Now, in order to maintain the family handicraft industry and relieve the rural areas, we have to improve the existing throwing shuttle weaving households, and in the future, we will definitely want to send each weaving household a pulling shuttle cloth machine to let them learn. As for dyeing without fading, it is necessary to use German Shade Stanlin, but how can the material be used without waste; how to set the color brightly, learning the operation is not easy, this is also for further research in the future, shallow like me, has been stored in my heart for a long time, I have to take the process and research, to the national goods experts, Shangqi not stingy to guide Fortunately!</p>

<p>Foreign Exchange: Brisk Buying, Marked by Rising Gold Prices</p>
<p>Someone Sells Bars, Still Rises Twelve Yuan</p>
<p>Already More Than Twenty Yuan Above the Standard Price</p>
<p>Yesterday's gold market saw sustained robust buying and unusually depleted supplies on the trading floor. Despite occasional supply of bars from certain parties, the situation was like a small amount of porridge for many monks, making it difficult to stem the overall trend. Chinese merchants continued to buy aggressively, putting pressure on banks. As a result, the exchange market, both officially and unofficially, tightened repeatedly, and the upward trend became even more pronounced. Overseas silver markets and the standard gold prices quoted by international telecommunications central banks had little impact on the sentiment of fellow traders. The market trend for half the day remained dominated by buyers, repeatedly breaking through the 56, 60, and 70 yuan marks. Early in the morning, foreign dispatches indicated stable British and rising American silver markets, also boosting exchange rates. However, due to a slight retraction of three and a half pence in the London pure gold price, sentiment softened slightly. Pre-market trading opened lower at 44-45 yuan, but buyers still actively stepped in, immediately pushing the price above 50 yuan. After the opening, the Central Bank's announced rates showed stable British and rising American silver by 1.25, Customs Gold falling by 0.04, and the standard gold price decreasing to 941.9 yuan. This caused temporary market hesitation and a dip, but sellers lacked strength, and the price stabilized after the drop. Ultimately, because the Central Bank's quoted price differed greatly from the market price, it was difficult to maintain confidence. The market soon turned bullish again, and the gold market also rebounded. The exchange market remained strong. HSBC's quoted rates narrowed again, triggering selling pressure, but a lack of suppliers caused it to break above 60 yuan. Although there was a pullback, the overall trend remained one of demand exceeding supply, with extremely scarce funding. Chinese and Western speculators continued to aggressively buy, and the exchange market was unusually bullish. British exchange tightened to within 1 shilling 5 pence, and US exchange also tightened to within 35 yuan. After two or three major players purchased bars, the market broke above the 70 yuan mark, and the upward trend accelerated rapidly. Certain parties took advantage of the high prices to sell bars through San Jin Exchange, and while prices dipped slightly after the surge, they remained resistant, hovering around 70 yuan. The domestic market eased slightly, and sellers on the trading floor were thinly spread, while certain parties continued to push prices down, causing gold prices to fall by slightly over 10 yuan. However, the short sellers suddenly covered their positions after the decline, and the domestic market tightened sharply due to banks' difficulty in coping. Sellers ultimately could not resist the buying pressure, and prices rose again above 70 yuan. HSBC's quoted rates were seen narrowing again. Subsequently, buyers gradually stabilized, but certain parties continued to push prices down, as the market price of gold was already 20-30 yuan higher than the standard quoted price, which should be maintained. There was a dip at one point before noon, but the 60 yuan mark remained difficult to break, and the market closed firm. Bullish sentiment continued after the market closed, approaching the 70 yuan mark. This was the second surge since the new standard for gold pricing was implemented. The market's chaos and price volatility were truly unexpected. Although there were various news reports and rumors, the situation was one where silver could not flow out and short positions were forced to be covered, resulting in no special impact. Price fluctuations depended entirely on whether buying and selling could occur opportunely, as there was no predictability for the future. The market situation for half the day is recorded below.</p>

It was also 14 yuan higher than the previous close.

The book value for this month is 966 yuan for November, 964 yuan for December, 966 yuan for replenishment in the morning, and 960 yuan for the gold price. With the gold market benefiting, the added water gradually flowed downstream. There were still few formal transactions in the market.

<p>Quoted Shilling Shrinks Again by 0.625, US Dollar by 1.125</p>
<p>According to yesterday's foreign dispatches, London's large bars were stable in both the near and distant terms, and the American bank rose again by 0.375. London's raw gold fell by 3.5 pence.

A dispatch from the Associated Press stated that the US would increase the price of newly mined silver to 64.5 cents, among other news. After the opening, the Central Bank's quoted rates showed stable British and rising American silver by 1.125, and Customs Gold falling by 0.04, making the market still loose. However, the overall trend was one of tight British and hard American exchange due to exchange relations. After HSBC's quoted rates were announced, British and American silver both narrowed by 1.125. After banks mutually traded once, they lacked the capacity to sell, and Chinese and Western merchants, such as Sassoon, continued to buy aggressively. The domestic market tightened unusually repeatedly. HSBC's quoted rates also narrowed twice, but there were many盘头 (speculative traders) in the middle, and the overall trend was uncertain. The future depends entirely on whether Chinese merchants can settle their purchases. With blue and white silver difficult to export, banks are no longer able to control the exchange market. During half the day, HSBC's quoted rates轧過 (calculated) a shrinkage of 0.625 for British and 1.125 yuan for American, a significant difference from the Central Bank's quoted rates, with a difference of over 1 penny for British and over 2 yuan for American compared to the market price.

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange believed that the environment was relatively stable and that the Fifth Plenary Session would be held as scheduled without any problems. People's hearts were quite firm, and there were more short positions in the forward market. However, due to the continued strong selling pressure, such as Nos. 4, 22, 46, and 77, there were considerable sell-offs in each sector, resulting in the setback of the slightly budding upward trend. However, the trend already showed signs of circling upwards. However, if No. 46 continues to be sold off, it will inevitably be subject to its pressure temporarily. Only because there are no major developments in the current situation, the scale of market price fluctuations is also very limited. Yesterday's process: the opening trend seemed to be firm, and market prices were slightly firm in each item under heavy selling pressure. However, the buying side was insufficient, and the second round showed signs of weakness. Market prices showed a state of alternating highs and lows. After the opening in the afternoon, the market price fell uniformly by 12 to 45 cents due to the exclusive strength of the selling pressure. The closing continued to be weak, mostly falling by another 12 cents. Occasionally, one or two varieties were slightly higher. As a result, market prices fell by 5 cents to 50 cents. The trend is still waiting for changes in the environment. The total transaction volume was 17,255,000 yuan. Ten shares of the company's shares. The results of their increases and decreases are listed in the comparison table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan, stock unit: 1 share).</p>

<p>According to a report by Sin Fung &amp; Co., the New York stock market rose yesterday (the 16th). The main reason was the strong support of silver stocks. Traders believed that the Treasury Department would soon be forced to raise the price of new mined silver. Moreover, traders were satisfied with the market's ease of rising. The bond market was boosted by stocks and commodities, and stocks on the small exchange were also firm. Chicago wheat rose due to inflation rumors and poor wheat crop reports. The total transaction volume for the day was 680,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is as follows:</p>
<p>15th 16th Up/Down</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 94.16 95.25 Up 1.09</p>

<p>The flour market rose immediately at the opening in the morning, and continued to rise in the afternoon. It expanded in each round, and the increase was very rapid. The market's enthusiasm and people's upward sentiment especially made the market price rise step by step. The reasons for the rise were influenced by rumors such as silver taxation, gold price increases, and currency devaluation. Stockholders wanted to sell but did not, and short covering was very strong. It also attracted the attention of silver and money industries and new bulls inside and outside the industry, resulting in a soaring market. Recent factory short covering was especially strong. However, in reality, large-scale actual sales are still waiting and seeing. The rise in market prices is entirely due to people's good expectations and floating stockholders competing to buy. Closing price: 9.75 cents higher for this month, 7.5 cents higher for next month, 5.75 cents higher for December, 6 cents higher for January, and 6.25 cents higher for February.</p>
<p>The wheat market rose because foreign wheat futures rose by 5 and 12 cents. The gold price rose, and spot wheat also saw a rise. Fixed wheat did not decline. People's hearts were upward. After the opening, there were outside bulls and floating stockholders buying. Short covering was especially strong. Therefore, after the opening price, each month immediately rose by 34 cents to 67 cents. Subsequently, it was reduced by bulls closing out positions. However, there were still customers for the long term. At the close, this month and next month were 2 cents higher each, December was 1 cent higher, January was 4 cents higher, and February was 6 cents higher. Spot wheat was bid up step by step. Yesterday, more than 1,000 bags of trucked wheat arrived, and the price was 10 cents higher, opening at 3.50 yuan, 3.50 yuan, and then 3.45 yuan.</p>
<p>Chicago wheat and corn were both strong. The report of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics stated that based on the domestic situation, market prices would be high. As a result, all parties engaged in purchasing. Generally, they ignored the threats of government intervention in coarse grain trading. Bad harvest news and tight livestock feed conditions made the coarse grain market strong. Rumor has it that due to the shortage of feed, wheat will be used to feed cattle and sheep. The grain industry believes that the high market price is no longer a problem.</p>

<p>(South of Shanghai) Various gangs suddenly surged, totaling nearly 60 lots (totaling more than 9,000 piculs). The situation of the densely planted Baige market initially appeared soft due to limited local demand. Later, Qingdao firms continued to handle 300 to 400 bags, and the market color gradually turned around. However, due to the unique abundance of incoming goods of thick Xin Geng such as white rice, the situation became one of oversupply. People's hearts were weaker, and prices plummeted by 20 to 30 cents. Dujian also fell by 20 cents. However, foreign Jian relied on scarce goods to be firm. The falling prices of various colors of broken hulling were generally flat in the end. The sales market for Bian Yuan and Xin Yin Yuan turned weak, and the market shape was soft. (North of Shanghai) Yesterday, various goods from He Xia arrived at the 78th of the first day of the month. The sales of various colors on the market, Xin Geng, Xin Yang Dujian, and retail demand turned weak. Broken Geng slightly improved, and densely planted Lian remained sluggish. Chen Bai Yuan, which was dismantled by other distilleries, moved slightly. Chen Bu Ke Jian and Xin Bu Ke Jian were still selling. Yin Yuan goods were scarce and sales were active. The market price of broken Geng was firm. The price of high-quality Xin Geng fell by a small 20 cents, and the price of medium-quality and inferior quality fell by 20 to 30 cents. The price of Xin Dujian Kiln Variety Chen Bai Yuan was about 10 cents. The price of Xin Yang Jian fell by 20 to 30 cents. Yin Yuan added a premium of 10 cents. The prices of Chen and Xin Bu Ke Jian were stable.</p>
<h3 id="e242">Sugar Market. Coarse Goods and White Sugar Rise by 30 Cents <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to rise by more than 10 yuan, and the customs gold was also tight. The trend was quite strong. The association's price for 24 coarse sand white sugar was 18.5 yuan for ordinary spot goods, an increase of 30 cents. The price for goods from this warehouse was 18.6 yuan. The price for transit goods was 5.4 yuan, an increase of 10 cents. However, because the increase was too much, the buying side waited and watched, resulting in no transaction. There was no significant increase or decrease in Dutch red sugar. The higher price was still 13.8 yuan, and the ordinary price was 13.65 yuan, a slight increase of 5 cents. There were not many transactions. The price of cotton white sugar from this factory rebounded more sharply because the previous market was low. Xingyu No. 1 rose by another 20 cents to 17 yuan. The quotation for Zhenji No. 1 was 17.3 yuan, but no transaction was made. Gao Xing opened dozens of bags of red sugar at 11.5 yuan. Due to the shrinking of Shantou Lake, the cost of Chaoqing sugar increased invisibly. The quotation for various brands also increased, such as Tizhuang Suo at 13 yuan, Gao Huanggang at 12.6 yuan, Gao Ban Nan Qing at 12.12 yuan, and Longgang Qing at 11.8 yuan. Although no transactions were made, the trend is that the market will inevitably be tight in the future.</p>

<p>The inventory of "diseased mushrooms" in various stores is thin. The retail demand in this street and inland areas is quite active. Therefore, they are sold as soon as they arrive, and the market is very strong. Yesterday, the quotation for Jianning mushrooms was 24 pieces, priced at 151.5 yuan to 147 yuan. The quotation for Ningguo mushrooms was 16 pieces, priced at 158 yuan. The buying appetite of the firms was strong, and the goods that arrived were distributed as scheduled. There were not many "winter mushrooms" on the market, and the price was very stable. The selected goods from Gao Zhuang were currently selling for 270 yuan, the ordinary price was 250 to 260 yuan, and thick mushrooms were 220 to 200 yuan.</p>

<p>Third Episode: Not Understanding Drifting, Peeking at the Door to Pity the Young Girl; Willing to Hear Suffering, Cherishing Jade, Visiting a Poor Family</p>
<p>That girl raised her eyelids, looked at him, smiled, and flashed her body under the eaves pillar. That small-footed woman followed behind and said: Don't you want to take another look? Why are you running? The girl smiled and said: There are so many people, running into someone else's house is quite embarrassing, let's go, I won't look anymore. The small-footed woman ignored her and gave the waiter a look. The waiter stood at the door and looked at Zhang Jiefu in the room again. Seeing the smile on his face, he said to the small-footed woman: Since he doesn't want to look anymore, take him to the front building to play. After a while, I will send the clothes to your home. The woman smiled and nodded, and took the girl away. As soon as they left, discussions began here. Li Shilian smiled and said: She is really a top-notch person. If she is groomed a little, she is sure to be a talent of upper-middle class. Zhang Jiefu had a cigarette in his mouth, walked out in slippers, and smiled at Cheng Zhiqian and said: I am acting on the spot. I heard that this girl had no luck finding relatives and wanted to sell herself to rely on two generations of people. I thought this girl had a heart and mind, so I wanted to take a look. What Brother Li said is right, we are here to seek a career, how can we do absurd things. Cheng Zhiqian sighed and felt that it was wrong, and smiled again. Zhang Jiefu didn't know what he meant, so he said to the waiter: We can't let people come for nothing. See how much money to give him? Saying that, he reached into his clothes pocket to touch it. The waiter smiled and said: Money is not necessary. This Hu family's sister-in-law said that this child has a family of three, and she is a young widow, how can she afford it. I just hope to quickly find someone for this girl, as the third wife or the second wife, it doesn't matter. He has a grandma and a mother, and it's enough to have food to eat. Cheng Zhiqian shook his head with both hands in his suit pants and said: This may be difficult. If you are the second or third wife, there must be a big wife on top. Whether the person can accommodate it is still a problem. Who can guarantee to support two generations of his family? (42)</p>
<h3 id="e246">Defending Zhang Fei <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Sha Yongcai</p>
<p>When it comes to Zhang Huanhou of the Three Kingdoms, there is really no one who doesn't know him. According to the folklore, his dignified appearance is the ancestor of ugly men with black faces and curly beards. According to the legend, his temperament is a reckless Heavenly Venerable who is furious. These two characteristics of him are also like his famous name, lasting for thousands of years. Anyone who looks at the stage and sits in the book hall has such an image in his mind about him.</p>
<p>However, according to the textual research in the official history, Huanhou's appearance and temperament are not as bad as the folk legend. According to the biography of Zhang Fei in the Biography of Famous Officials in the ancient version: His behavior is described as "swallowing jaw and ring eyes, and his appearance is very great." It can be seen that he is only a little different from ordinary people in the jaw and eyes. His temperament is "fierce and refreshing, with quick wit, and often has many surprising strategies in every battle." It can be seen that he is not only not irritable, but also has talent and wisdom, and is not a reckless man who does not know a single character. Probably the reason why later generations mistakenly passed him as a reckless Heavenly Venerable is because of misunderstanding the two words "fierce and refreshing."</p>
<p>In the area of ​​Langzhong County in northern Sichuan Province, Huanhou was originally the garrison during the Shu Han Dynasty, and his tomb is still there. Therefore, there are many Huanhou temples there, and the statues in the temples are mostly dignified and solemn, not full of soot-like scary faces. This is in line with the records in the historical records. Recently, according to a report in the Beiping newspaper, Mr. Jin, the president of the Lake Society, said that "Zhang Fei of the Shu Han Dynasty was good at painting, and he was especially good at painting beauties, and he was also good at calligraphy. His calligraphy was elegant and vigorous. Now it can still be found in ancient steles." According to this, Huanhou is not only rich in talent and wisdom, but also has more elegant things. It is only because the historical records rarely record this item, and the folk romances have too much exaggeration, which makes thousands of years later, fabricated and attached, all losing the truth, which is regrettable!</p>

<p>Most of the small toys are actually foreign goods, and more than 570,000 yuan of gold has flowed into the pockets of foreigners in a period of half a year! Is this the fault of the children? Or is it the fault of the children's family? Or is it the fault of the children's teacher? This is worth pondering!</p>
<h3 id="e248">Taking Pictures <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>I have never been very happy to take pictures in my life. I often point out that the technicians who take pictures are invaders of freedom. If their aesthetic concepts are indeed brilliant, then I will also be convinced. Standing, they must make people stand straight, like a stalagmite. Sitting, they must make people put their right leg on their left leg, and forcibly call them elegant even if they are not elegant. If they don't smile, they must pretend to smile, and if they smile, they are not allowed to show their teeth. How to put their heads and how to stretch their feet, they must listen to their command. The photo studio's photo studio is less free and more oppressed than the command headquarters' detention center. It is not wise to spend money to buy hardship.</p>
<p>Many of my friends are "modern youths". In addition to 14K gold fountain pens, Zeiss platinum glasses, flat watches, etc., they are each equipped with a camera. Everyone thinks that I will often have the opportunity to take pictures without spending money. However, this is a big mistake. Because my friends all take art as their standpoint, and ugliness like mine does not meet the conditions of art at all. People who study photography art, in addition to scenery, still life, and livestock, should use women as the most suitable materials. Therefore, women enjoy the exclusive right to free photography. Whenever I travel and play in the wild, I see my friends taking all kinds of poses with their girlfriends, and I can't help but feel "I hate not being born as a daughter."</p>
<p>People who take the most pictures in the world should be dignitaries and movie stars. Yesterday, I visited the City God Temple and saw that all the photo studios took photos of dignitaries and stars and hung them on the door, and wrote "Special Price Reduction" and other words next to them as an advertisement to attract customers. Those who saw it found it interesting.</p>

<p>— Zhu Shaofei</p>
<p>Probably anyone who has been to our East Mountain in spring and autumn has to go up the mountain to taste the unique wild tea. In spring, there are birds singing and flowers are fragrant, and in autumn, there are red maple leaves, full of picturesque poetry, making people reluctant to leave.</p>
<p>The specialty of East Mountain, such as Before the Rain and Biluochun, are fine buds like silver threads. When you brew a cup, it tastes delicious. It is very elegant to drink wild tea with these two kinds of tea leaves. The stove is built of stones, the firewood can be picked up on the spot, and the water is taken from the clear stream in the mountain stream.</p>
<p>The address is often in front of the tombs of ordinary people, or in deeper mountain valleys. Xinmiao's Shou tomb is recommended in the front mountain, and Xuejiawu in Chawanwu is recommended in the back mountain. These two places are good places to drink wild tea, because there are smooth stone tables and stone benches, and lush pine and cypress trees. If you are in high spirits, bring a card and play a few rounds of mahjong. You can both taste the spring and taste the tea, and you can also travel and play. It kills two birds with one stone. Why not do it?</p>
<p>These days, I happened to be returning to my hometown, and I met two or three childhood friends, and agreed to go to Xuejiawu to drink wild tea every afternoon after lunch. No one had the interest to play cards. Each of us took our favorite books, newspapers, magazines, and all the necessary copper pots and tea cups, and stepped on the rugged mountain road with brisk steps. Arrived at the destination!</p>
<p>Taking turns to start the fire, fetch water, and pick up firewood, in a blink of an eye, the water in the pot was boiling. Each child brews a cup. So. Those who read books read books, and those who take a walk take a walk, until the sun sets and the birds and animals return to their nests, then they return with great interest.</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Our family is also his direct descendant, but because there are too many branches passed down, we are not very valued. Just look at this ready-made explanation. The Empress Dowager is a descendant of the Yehe Nara clan. In the past, the Yehe Nara clan can be said to have absolutely no important position. Until the demise of the Qing Dynasty, there was no second person in their clan worth paying attention to except for Empress Dowager Cixi alone. 丨丨 and as for me, although on the surface, no one can deny that I am a direct descendant of Nurhaci, but now I am serving the Empress Dowager in the palace, and some people are secretly praising me. It can be said that the situation is changing a lot, and it is difficult to predict personnel matters!</p>

<p>— Bingyu</p>
<p>After drinking, you can take the dishes with chopsticks (Japanese chopsticks are disinfected, sealed in paper bags, unpacked when used, and the chopsticks are taken out. The chopsticks are made of wood, one end is cut into two branches, and the other end is connected. Use both hands to pull them apart.) The second time the main dishes are served, each person will be sent a rice bucket. You must not chew loudly when eating, showing a hungry ghost appearance. When taking a bowl to drink soup, you should specify a pair of hands and do not change them from left to right. After the fourth dish is served, the guests should thank the host for their kindness, and then choose to eat from the dishes on the plate as you like. Because there are many dishes, they cannot all be eaten. If you cannot eat them, you can leave the third and fourth dishes uneaten, and only eat some fragrant things (such as lettuce, radish pickles, etc.). After eating, hot water will be brought, and the female servant will use hot water to rinse the rice bowl. The rice crumbs in the rice bowl and the hot water are eaten together.</p>
<p>(2) A slightly formal banquet dish This is an ordinary banquet held in a restaurant. The order of serving dishes is first soup, then two dishes, then three dishes, and finally the main dish. Wine is served before the dishes, so you can pour and drink as you like. However, the menu varies according to the situation of each store. Usually, appetizers are served first (there are salty, sour, sweet, and spicy varieties, packed in a divided pot, allowing guests to take whatever they like). At this time, guests should take some of each dish, indicating that they like to eat everything. The second course is soup and sashimi (sashimi is a kind of raw fish slices, called Sesimi by the Japanese). When eating sashimi, do not use chopsticks to grab the back of the fish body and dip it in soy sauce before eating. The third course is grilled fish. Grilled fish can be whole or sliced. If it is whole meat, you can use chopsticks to remove the fish bones in the middle before eating. Secondly, there are boiled dishes, added dishes, etc., which are served one after another. When eating boiled dishes, you must not stick the eggs and tofu to the edge of the bowl. The next course is rice. The rice at the banquet is slightly different from the rice when eating the main dishes. The rice at the banquet is sent out last, with miso soup (cooked with fish flour, miso, and green onions) and fragrant things served together. After eating the rice, tea and a towel are sent up. At this time, the guests should politely say, "The dishes are very good, I am very full, thank you very much.</p>
<p>(3) How to eat a single dish Usually, when you go to the home of a middle-class friend, you will be treated with simple dishes. Other ordinary restaurants also have them. However, the single dishes made in restaurants are mostly casual and not very tasty. The oriental restaurants (Oryori) along Wusong Road and North Sichuan Road in this city are all treasures of this kind of dish, for example (1) "Sukiyaki" uses beef, chicken, green vegetables, tofu, winter bamboo shoots, green onions, soy sauce, sugar, etc. mixed together (there are also seasonal variations, probably with beef and chicken as the main ingredients) and is temporarily cooked and eaten on the table, and everyone eats it together in one pot at will. When eating, first take out the cooked vegetables from the pot with chopsticks and dip them in raw eggs (2) Dongpuriri, called well, is a large bowl of rice dishes, with various kinds of dishes and rice mixed together, such as raw fish, chicken, clams, yams, shrimp, sesame, seaweed, and other kinds, also depending on the season) similar in style to our country's Babao rice. (3) Sisi is a large plate filled with fish, meat, vegetables, mixed rice, sauce, vinegar, etc. When eating, it should be divided into small plates from the large plate. If you think the taste is light, you can dip it in the soy sauce dish first before eating.</p>
<p>(4) The combination of bento Bento is a simple meal prepared by Japanese people when they go out to work or go to school, and is placed in a nickel-plated box or a box made of wood chips. There are many styles of matching rice and dishes, some with mixed rice and dishes, and some with separate rice and dishes. You can match them as you like according to your favorite foods. There are ready-made ones sold at various train stations in Japan. The prices are also high and low depending on the materials used.</p>
<p>(5) New Year's rice in January When you go to a Japanese home to celebrate the New Year, they will first take out Fucha (tea) and snacks (fruit soup cake). When drinking tea, you should eat the tea in the teacup in two or three mouthfuls. Secondly, Tosu wine is served. There are three sets of wine cups for pouring Tosu, from small to large (Japanese wine cups are numbered one, two, and three. The one on the top is number one, which is a small cup, the one in the middle is a medium cup, and the one on the bottom is a large cup). People with large amounts of alcohol can drink as they please. After drinking Tosu wine, there is soup (cooked with seaweed and bird meat). This soup can be divided into small bowls to eat. According to the rules, it should be eaten all up and no leftovers should be left.</p>

<h3 id="e254">On Elegance <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Tianshe</p>
<p>One day at a certain hour, I forgot to bring newspapers and magazines to the toilet. Daydreaming, I went from chrysanthemums to Tao Yuanming, from Tao Yuanming to nobility, and then to elegance. So, let's talk about elegance.</p>
<p>Elegance is easy to talk about, but difficult to practice. Things like not cutting your hair for a year, not bathing for six months, reading alone in the deep mountains, inscribing words on high peaks, being able to eat five bowls of rice but still feigning three parts sick, etc., are beyond the reach of ordinary vulgar people. Roughly speaking, elegant people must have unique personalities.</p>
<p>China is originally a country of ancient elegance. In the four seasons and eight festivals, there are always elegant things to be found. "Spring outings on fragrant grasslands, summer appreciation of green lotus ponds, autumn meals with chrysanthemum wine, winter recitations of white snow poems." The moon in the middle of the ninth month does not appear as bright as in the middle of the eighth month, so appreciation is useless. But as the Mid-Autumn Festival passes and the Double Ninth Festival arrives, the act of "climbing high" may not be less elegant than "moon appreciation"! We cannot regard "Meng Jia losing his hat" as a story of fleeing in panic, because now there are "concessions," and "climbing mountains and ascending heights" should be included in elegant activities. Even the most unbearable vulgar fellows will be transformed if they just blow in the mountain breeze.</p>
<p>A person who has become perfectly pure in elegance will pace back and forth in the Rising Sun Building. When he receives a death announcement, he will write lyrical poems on it. Even if four more provinces are lost, he will remain indifferent, because in the circle of elegance, there are no such things as saving the country, joining the army, or sacrificing oneself. Therefore, "national affairs" are best left to "who cares." The places that elegant gentlemen frequent are nothing more than famous mountains and great rivers, teahouses and taverns, gardens and opera stages. The things that elegant gentlemen often do are nothing more than enjoying the moon and reciting poetry, treading on snow to seek plum blossoms, drinking wine and tasting tea, etc. I will not list them in detail.</p>
<p>In this so-called "poetic autumn," chrysanthemums are blooming and crabs are plump. They will inevitably be burdened to "steal leisure from busy times" to engage in the elegant activity of "holding crabs and admiring chrysanthemums." When talking about chrysanthemums, one must mention "Eastern Fence," and "round navels in September, pointed in October" must be recited fluently. The vision of "noble" people is of course also detached from the vulgar. They only consider that a pair of crab claws that can pinch people meet the requirements of "elegance." If you hold the crab's body to look at chrysanthemums, or hold the crab's claws to admire roses, you will cause a great illogical joke and few will not scold you as a vulgar person!</p>
<p>It is said that a truly elegant person has not a single vulgar bone in their body. This of course requires physiologists to study, but that kind of calm and unrestrained demeanor is indeed rare and valuable.</p>
<h3 id="e255">Under the Setting Sun <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>"Evening Post Evening Post"</p>
<p>A sound like scraping a clay pot.</p>
<p>"Half-past five" on the clock in the office, on the driver's train watch, on the comprador's "Cyma."</p>
<p>In the soft yellow light of the setting sun, in the tide of people rushing out of the office, there is a small, thin head, shouting with a dry, raspy voice. Hopeful eyes are filled with moisture, fixing their gaze on those in Western suits, those sitting in private cars. But few are caught. Many people glance at the headlines on the cover and run away.</p>
<p>Some beautiful young people just stand in front of the large glass window looking at the cheap goods.</p>
<p>The setting sun climbs onto every piece of metal, shooting out countless needles that prick the shallow eyelids of people. Diamond rings, miniature cameras, J4K large-sized vacuum fountain pens, autumn wool sweaters... Watching, watching, many people weave a dream of material vanity on their shallow eyelids.</p>
<p>The current drought and the extreme danger of the 1936 world war are things they are separated from.</p>
<p>However, the child, as dirty as a mangy dog, runs down the street shouting as loud as he can, carrying the evening paper. He and the hearts of all passersby are separated.</p>
<p>The yellow setting sun is plastered on the white tile wall of the coffee shop. Thick and thin leg shadows move on it, so chaotic and hurried. People coming out of the office come here to rest for a while. "Borsalino" hats and flannel jackets are hung on the coat rack by the white-clothed waiter. They order an evening tea, coconut cake and Brazilian coffee, and let the red lips of the female staff swallow the fatigue of the day, revealing exotic teenage sensuality. The coffee is so strong.</p>
<p>But the mangy-dog-like child selling the evening paper shouts even louder, with a tremor, with a taste of sorrow, "Evening Post"</p>
<p>"Ghost, evil ghost, endlessly noisy, get out!" From the second-floor window across the street comes an angry face with gold-rimmed glasses. The child selling the evening paper immediately knows he is being chased away. He is often threatened by the foreign bosses in that real estate company. He instinctively lowers his head, looking at the setting sun covering his feet. He discovers that his feet are starting to move towards a side street with no sunlight.</p>
<p>The people in the office have all left. Only the large wall calendar with landscape paintings, the typewriter, the hourglass bottle rack, the steel stationery box... accompany the loneliness of the evening.</p>
<p>On the street, quietly, a new streamlined car crawls past like a beetle, without a sound. From the coffee shop come graceful steps, fluttering silver silk skirt corners, fluttering brown ties. Foreign soldiers, two or three, five or six, come in waves, waving leather whips, humming "li la li la" endlessly. The setting sun is trampled blurred and faded under their leather whips.</p>
<p>The child selling the evening paper bursts back onto the street, shouting, "Evening Post..." Standing on the street corner like a fossil, a person who has lost inspiration, his life is blurred, faded.</p>
<h3 id="e256">On a Child Who Lost His Father in Autumn <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— Buyang</p>
<p>Autumn falls entirely on the child who has lost his father.</p>
<p>Gray encounters, gray clothes, a gray soul, everything is immersed in a gray dye vat.</p>
<p>Tears constantly moisten his gloomy face, like the sky during autumn rain.</p>
<p>He is a melancholic person in a season full of melancholy!</p>
<p>Three months ago, he was still a very energetic young man. He lived happily, lightly spending carefree years. He was interested in everything. In the entire history of his life (twenty-one years), there was no autumn, although he also wore autumn clothes sometimes.</p>
<p>He hated autumn like he hated a sentimental and sickly woman. Unpredictable weather can be tested with a woman!</p>
<p>But on the day he rushed five hundred miles in one breath, on the day his father stepped into another world, he lost all the happiness he had previously enjoyed; even his only pride perished with it.</p>
<p>From that day on, he began to gradually come into contact with the season he had previously hated.</p>
<p>It was not voluntary; it was a kind of orphan's sorrow being forcibly executed.</p>
<p>So, a layer of gloomy gauze like that of a pregnant woman covered his spring-like face. Tears, which were originally not easily found, are now like dew in the autumn night, everywhere to be seen.</p>
<p>Leaning on the half table by the window, supporting his chin with both hands, he turned his watery eyes to look at the sky: the sky was heavy and gray, and fine rain like tears was falling. Perhaps it was sympathizing with him! Thinking this, he felt a trace of comfort in his heart.</p>
<p>Autumn is suitable for sharing hardships, he admits.</p>
<p>So, the autumn that he had once expressed hatred for and that was forcibly executed, he now felt a sense of favor for. He felt that he should make a living in the bleak fallen leaves and the desolate cicada sounds. He felt that he should find a way out in the autumn wind and rain.</p>
<p>This was a view he had personally experienced. He was glad that he could find a lover to confide in, in the lonely depths of the night.</p>
<p>That's how he involuntarily got engaged to a sentimental and sickly woman.</p>
<p>That's how, unconsciously, the elements of autumn passed through his whole body.</p>

<h3 id="e257">On the Pasture <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— Youhan</p>
<p>Everything is moving on the pasture. The cow's tail wags with extra vigor, and mosquitoes swarm in the air: it's dusk.</p>
<p>Xiao He, like a dog, rolls around on the pasture; his body is so light that he rolls across half the pasture in one go. Only then does his head feel a little dizzy. He turns over, stands up, looks around with his eyes, raises his voice, and shouts sharply:</p>
<p>"Fuck your mother, Xiao Mu!"</p>
<p>The cow named Xiao Mu hears this and hastily drops the mustard flower from its mouth, and runs out of the vegetable garden as if fleeing for its life, dragging its tail.</p>
<p>Xiao He rushes over, seizes Xiao Mu's nose ring, and sends a whip hard into the cow's belly. The cow endures the pain, turns its body several times, moves its feet lightly, and utters a pleading "Ooh!"</p>
<p>Xiao He gets his breath back, releases the cow's nose ring; straightens his arms, which are exactly level with the cow's back, presses down, and mounts the cow's back.</p>
<p>The cow continues to lower its head to graze; Xiao He hangs his limbs down, lies on his back on the cow's back, hums a Red Lotus Song, and stares at the clean evening sky, thinking in his heart: "A Ying begged..."</p>
<p>Twilight and evening breeze added a little together.</p>
<p>"Xiao He! Xiao He!" A Ying finally came; Xiao He's heart jumped, and he slid down the grass from the cow's back.</p>
<p>Over there, under the sycamore tree, A Ying stood there waving: "Come here, Xiao He."</p>
<p>"You come here," Xiao He squatted on the grass laughing; but didn't go over.</p>
<p>"Don't be like that! Come quickly, I have something to tell you," it was an urgent voice, her face a little red, not smiling.</p>
<p>Seeing that A Ying was really not joking, Xiao He's heart jumped heavily again; no longer hesitating, he ran towards her against the wind.</p>
<p>When the two pairs of hands clasped, the four dimples did not appear at the same time as in the past; Xiao He didn't wait to sit down and asked nervously:</p>
<p>"What's the matter, tell me quickly!"</p>
<p>Pouting her mouth, frowning her brows, she replied together: "Dad is going to sell me"</p>
<p>"Sold?!" Xiao He half believed and half didn't believe it.</p>
<p>"Yes!"</p>
<p>"Really? How do you know?"</p>
<p>"Mom told me," her mouth pouted even more severely, "She said Dad owes money to Master Xue in the city, and he can't pay it back; yesterday Master Xue sent someone to our house to collect the debt again, and Dad had no choice but to agree to send me to him as a maid, as a way to pay off the debt."</p>
<p>That's right, Xiao He understood now. Yesterday, when he was driving the cow past A Ying's door, he saw a city person pounding on the table in her house, scolding like thunder, and A Ying's Dad stood aside trembling.</p>
<p>"Oh!" He was stunned, he couldn't see anything in front of him, "When are you going?" he asked; but in his heart, he always thought that A Ying could at least play with him for a few more days.</p>
<p>"Tomorrow morning, Dad will take me away."</p>
<p>"Just tomorrow?" he asked so loudly, it sounded like a shout. "Tomorrow!" How sour this was! So sour that the two tender hearts could no longer bear it, so, round and round tears rolled down their red little cheeks, rolled down, rolled down.</p>
<p>For a long time, they were silent; the wind rolled their hair.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a hope flashed through Xiao He's mind, and his heart suddenly warmed up. He suddenly asked:</p>
<p>"Can you escape back?"</p>
<p>Being asked this suddenly, she hesitated for a moment. Many difficulties that children could think of appeared before her eyes. Finally, she shook her head and replied:</p>
<p>"No, I don't know the way!"</p>
<p>"Then!" Xiao He thought of the road; the road! How far it was! He stopped talking.</p>
<p>"What?" she asked, chasing closely, asking eagerly.</p>
<p>However, he couldn't answer. Disappointment. The two faced each other; there were no words, only tears rolling. Finally, they bumped heads and cried loudly.</p>
<p>The pasture was so vast, the sound of crying dissipated in the air.</p>
<p>Dusk reached its end. The sky, except for a white corner in the west; the rest was gray and dark. In the center of the pasture, the cow, full of grass, raised its head, looked around at the vast atmosphere, and uttered a long "Ooh..." in search of its owner's return.</p>

<p>— Xiaolin</p>
<p>The metropolis at night is like a promiscuous prostitute, half-naked, shamelessly throwing seductive smiles, teasing smiles at people. Many people, like this, become neurotic, go crazy, and bury their entire souls and minds in that desolate bewitching array.</p>
<p>Using gold to buy false pleasure, to buy the intoxication of time, in the high-speed oscillation of intoxication, without thought, one becomes a sensory machine, inseparable from the sensual enjoyment of material desires. Everything else does not exist in the eyes, not even oneself.</p>
<p>The night of the metropolis is an endless exchange of human desire mixed with the power of money. In the ballroom, under the dim red lights, the world suddenly shrinks to the size of you and me. Gold blooms, and carnal desire overflows. Life is seen as light as a goose feather, as ethereal as a cloud! As if if you miss today, there will be no tomorrow. So sin is regarded as proper, sending oneself to hell, wasting life to the fullest, and dissipating the days in promiscuity. These people who come and go to the colorful places are mostly burdens or outliers between people. Zombies with only a body and no soul. Living off inheritances, the content of their lives is ugly, decadent, which is equal to chronic suicide for themselves, and invisibly creates many evils for others.</p>
<p>Not knowing day, not knowing night, muddling through life, daily life cannot be separated from luxurious material supplies, so they are slaves of matter, prisoners of matter, and have no spiritual nourishment at all. However, they are considered to be upper-class figures in society, stepping on people's heads, basely stealing life. Their existence, although undeniable, is worthless, far less dignified than the life of a so-called lower-class person who works hard with his own hands to earn his own living.</p>
