<p>時評</p>
<h3>日本外交新陣綫</h3>
<p>— 舒</p>
<p>日本自發動九一八事變後。幣原外交完全失敗。後任諸人。大都承仰軍部鼻息。盲目顢頇。而日軍閥則滿擬依賴武力。諸事可迎刃而解。不料在亞洲大陸上遇到勁敵蘇聯。使他不敢輕舉妄動。對俄軍事的整備。雖已盡心竭力。而最後的勝利。依舊不可期待。日本的海軍閥。亦總想確保太平洋上的覇權。甚欲駕英美而上之。因此引起美國的反感。雖在表面上日美間並無甚麽險惡現象。但我人看美國大隊飛機飛訪阿拉斯加。大西洋艦隊調集太平洋。羅斯福總統特遊夏威夷等種種事實。都足以證明美國注重太平洋防務。不尙空言。而務重實際。同時。英國對於日本的行徑。也很有點不快。深懼遠東市塲不保。印度統制有被推翻的威脅。長此以往。日本眞將陷於自殺的孤立。重以今年四一七的天羽聲明。將廣田所標榜的有理外交。亦根本否定。把廣田和赫爾的換文付諸流水了。</p>
<p>海軍軍備縮小會議已快臨頭。設使日本在外交技巧上不能運用圓滑。那末。英美大有聯合的可能。日本終將不免於被挾制。所以廣田竭力鼓吹他的有理外交。並且實行駐歐美各國的大使的總動員。要他們先行回國聽訓。商議好了應付的策略。（特别。是應付未來的軍縮會議）然後向駐在國分頭進攻。廣田的主要策劃。最重緊的是在拉攏英國。因爲英國主張减小主力艦噸位。增加輕巡洋艦。與日本主張大有接近調和的可能。</p>
<p>英國對於日本最不放心的是恐怕遠東市塲。爲日本所侵佔。於是日本特别以東三省的門户開放爲引誘。答應給英國人去投資。竭力歡迎英國的産業考察團到東北去考察。並一反九一八後對於滿洲的封鎖政策。使他變爲恊商主義。日本首先提出增進商業關係的口號。去打動英國産業考察團四位實業家的心弦。使他們都同情於日本的意圖。其期待促成的事項。大概有四種。</p>
<p>（一）　日英提携。開發「滿洲」資源。英國對「滿」通商發展之可能性。</p>
<p>（二）　促進英國對「僞組織」之承認。</p>
<p>（三）　以日英同盟時代之傳統友誼關係爲基礎。而重新樹立政治恊定之基本工事。（按即隠含英日同盟復活意味。）</p>
<p>（四）　海外市塲上日英商業競爭之緩和及恊定等。如能次第發展。則以往在倫敦所開「日英棉業會議。」今後或將繼續進行。」</p>
<p>以上四項。未必即能實現。英國人未必就肯接受。産業考察團。也不是負責任的外交組織。這都是日本當局所讅知的。其所以努力不懈的原因。無非先想要求得到英國實業界的諒解。使日英關係不再惡化。并且漸見好轉。日本就可好乘此時期。更進一步而圖實現其對華政治上的計劃了。他又知道美國爲開發遠東市塲起見。决不讓日本獨占。設若一味硬幹。不用外交。單憑兵力。終究是要吃虧的。日本從前曾盛倡對美開戰論。現在竟一反舊時面目。力求日美間情感上的緩和。避免語言文字上的衝突。目的亦是一樣的。不過日本在實力的準備。却决不放鬆。對於海軍軍備平等的要求。亦期待必行。</p>
<p>日本近來的外交政策。自謂是積極的。因爲他有强大的海軍爲背景。進圖經濟市塲的發展。即如「軍備比率平等」的主張。確實含有政治作用的。表面上想以各國承認傀儡國爲交換條件。而内幕中則企圖用恊調融和之名。以增進其經濟利益之實。有必要時卽與英國恊力。共分遠東市塲。使美國無從發展。自己則收獲更大的利益。這是他外交上活動新佈置的陣容。</p>
<h3>日本處心積慮對俄與俄之西鄰表示親善使一旦有事保守中立</h3>
<p>（巴黎）　此間「日報」載日本雖遭失敗、仍在厲行其包團蘇聯之政策、圖令蘇聯近鄰保守中立、該報令人注意、日本正派軍事代表團抵波蘭、並謂波蘭工業界已接受日方訂購軍需品之定單、該報特别指出芬蘭、謂月前曾有日本經濟調查團由日本實業巨子赤川率領、訪問芬蘭首都云、（五日塔斯電）</p>
<h3>俄使會見廣田續談中東路問題</h3>
<p>（東京）　蘇俄大使優烈尼夫五日下午五時半訪問廣田外相、相談二小時後始辭出、會見内容、由外相說明「滿洲國」對於蘇俄提出條件之意見、即俄方所提條件爲、（一）現金分三年支付、第二第三兩年須付利息、日政府保證此事、（二）物品分兩年繳納、由日政府保證、物品種類不加限定、（三）認第一次付欵之期爲實際上之讓渡期、（四）俄籍路員離職須於三月前通告等等、「滿洲國」之意見對於一二兩項雖有不同意見、然日政府保證付欵及其付欵方法可尋適當方法、第三項俄方認付欵時爲讓渡期、但「滿洲國」認簽字時爲接收鐡路之時、第四項爲在繼續營業上最要注意之問題、俄方擬於簽字收欵後卽時召回路員、滿方恐營業不能圓滑、要求適當辦法、又是日會見俄使、關於兩三事項保留回答、（六日日聯電）</p>
<h3>日本謀與英設通商恊議會英官場謂未有所聞</h3>
<p>（東京）　外務省擬乘此次英國産業團一行來日之機會、設立永久的日英通商恊議會、擬於一行視察「滿洲國」之後歸國之前、草成具體方法、現正由來栖通商局長與經濟聯盟之高島主事接洽草案、巴皮爵士等亦希望成立、而在東京倫敦設通商恊議會、日本由經濟聯盟英國由産業聯盟選出同數之代表的實業家爲斡旋者、（六日電通電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　東京電傳、日本實業家因英國實業聯合會派遣攷查團前赴滿洲、故擬組織一種英日委員會、以便調整兩國商務關係、英國官塲聞此消息之後、宣稱絕未聞有此類計畫、但云英國攷查團係英國實業聯合會所派、至於商務談判、則多由政府發動、兩者之間、不能有任何關係、惟如此云云、並非謂英國實業考查團代表與日本實業家不能舉行談話、彼此如以非正式形勢、互相詢問消息、固仍可行之也、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>海軍談話美主涉及政治表示對華傳統友誼日本意見與之對立</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　今日此間接華盛頓消息稱、外間紛紛謠傳美國現力主海軍會議應兼及政治問題、此蓋由美國白銀政策引起中國輿情之反響、故欲藉此彌補缺憾也、美國白銀政策不致更變、因是華盛頓願表示其對華之傳統的友誼、並未損弱、同時日本則堅决反對海軍會議涉及政治、謂滿洲事件前在日内瓦之爭論、已證明會議外交之無效、遠東大局今已明白規定範圍、無事可供討論云、此間美國外交界在美代表台維斯抵英前、未悉美政府之意嚮、至於中國之態度雖可猜度、而尙未經正式宣示、凡與中國友善者、均切言海軍會議實爲袪除遠東猜疑之良好機會、反之若將政治問題屏棄不論、則將有極惡影響及於中國之輿情、蓋一九二二年會議固曾以政治問題爲一整個部分也云（十月五日字林報專電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　美總統任命作戰部長史丹萊爲海軍預備會議顧問、俄然引起英國新聞界注意、本日泰晤士報特載華盛頓電報謂、美政府任命史丹萊爲代表顧問、用意使大海軍主戰者得發言機會、美政府極力維持現行比率主義、反對廢除航空母艦轟炸機說之决意、以此明瞭頗爲强硬、其他各報亦論美政府主張維持現行比率反對航空母艦態度之强硬、並預期討論政治問題、預備會議未開會前、日美意見之對立顯著、會議成功希望極少云、（五日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）　據確實方面息、海軍部對十月之軍縮初步談判及明年軍縮正式會議、確認爲已無妥恊之可能、大角海相乃準備於十月下旬或十一月上旬、使廣田外相訓令主席代表松平大使宣布廢棄華盛頓條約、他方面西園寺元老·牧野内大臣·湯淺宫内大臣·等重臣亦透視海軍部之蠻幹無法可制止、乃積極準備第二段之和平工作、卽爲由側面緩和陸海軍部之戰爭態度、企圖與宣佈廢約同時、向英美兩國提議締結另外和平條約、廣田外和派往歐美之前大使吉田茂氏、除傳達廣田意見以外、尙以向英美提議另訂條約爲重要使命、吉田茂係牧野内大臣之女婿也、元老重臣又另囑松井大使將向英政府疏通、在日本國内、卽使前外相幣原男爵連絡財閥及其他非戰主義勢力、以謀脫避戰爭危機云、（六日華聯電）</p>

<p>青海番族生活概述（中）</p>
<p>番民婚姻制度、純係自由戀愛之形式、雖有憑父母之命、媒妁之言者、有以卜卦定婚者、然非當事人之相悅與同意、不僅斷難勉强成功、並且事先亦絕無此種婚議、蓋番地青年男女、在十三四齡、爲環境誘惑、即漸開始其追求生活、女未及笄、男未弱冠、欲求完璧無損、實已不可多得、然父母并不以此爲惜、社會亦不以此爲怪也、議婚之初、男家先送禮物、如牛羊馬匹、哈達毡毯等物、女家歡接、即可預備親迎、然亦有璧返其物、以示别有所屬者、婚時男家須請喇嘛卜日、懸掛佛像、前設小桌、上列酥油乳餅、各種食物、兩旁舖皮墊爲座、並特舖白毡一條、中心用小麥堆成卍字花紋、以俟新娘至而坐之、然此種儀式、不用者亦多、</p>
<p>女家收到男家親迎之禮、（亦卽牛馬茶布等物、豐嗇可稱家之有無）卽倩男女親友四五人、各乘好馬、陪送新婦、新婦衣帽及靴、皆用皮製、雙手用汗巾蔽面、口唱歌曲、婉轉清脆、歌曲自幼學習、將嫁時、並特請老婦敎之、其重視如此、男家部落、全體老幼、均着華服、鵠候道旁、爭睹新婦光臨、雖遭男送賓之鞭驅、亦不見怪、有數處、當新婦入門時、迎者先匿門後、趁新婦不覺、大吼一聲、隨撒五榖一把、謂可驅逐鬼魔、然新婦之胆怯者、魂已遠飛九霄矣、後有拜家神與翁姑者、亦有不拜者、惟新郎間有深匿他處、而不見客、殊爲可怪、女家送賓、於歡宴時、先送哈達及簡單之賠奩數事、並將女家門庭、如何高貴、頌揚一番、意若本不屑聯姻、因天緣難逃、勢不得已、望新郎自勉自愛、嗣男家親友答詞、兩不相下、醉後口角、幾至拔刀相向者亦時有之、但爲習俗所拘、作此一時之互相示威而已、翌日、男家親友、輪流欵待新婦、新婦旋亦歸寗、數日後再擇吉迎接一次、婚禮始告完成、然上述婚禮、似多爲鄰近省縣之熟番行之、尙未可稱爲最普通之婚禮、蓋番民普通婚禮、實亦無具體儀式可言、卽每於迎神賽會、慶吊歌舞之塲、男女雜沓、兩相悅慕、卽爲訂婚嚙臂之舉、嗣雖徵父母同意、但只說好、並不尙買賣制度、亦無幣帛往來、卽行嫁娶、親友賓朋、僅饗冷酒數盌、旣無餚饌佐酒、且須自酌自飲、興濃酒酣、唱歌取樂、先擇女子中之最美健者、口唱幽曲、手持酒盌、看到意中人（男子）、卽以右手持酒、左手摟頭灌飲之、若手中原執高帽、卽將高帽置彼懷中、該男子卽起身答唱、另尋女對象而交替、先歌喜曲酒曲、漸變淫詞邪詞、迨至夜闌更深、酩酊大醉、每人散給半熟羊肉一方、各自拔刀割食喜笑而歸、翌晨、各理其事、新郎新婦、亦無三朝彌月、久宴賓朋之煩、旣痛快、又經濟、殆不得以番俗而鄙視之也、</p>
<p>倘生女而無男、亦有納壻之例、若恐納壻不肖、（如因殺人搶刦、以至傾家蕩産、這是番地男子、最易惹的禍事、）但爲延嗣起見、僅將其年已及笄之女、打拌成婦人之裝飾、向天拜頭、卽可招蜂惹蝶、求仁得仁矣、間有一家弟兄四五人、送二三人入寺當喇嘛、其餘共娶一妻、據可保持手足深情、不致因有妯娌分家析産、難於維持生活之虞、所生子女、則呼長者爲大父、餘以二父三父呼之、婦女身體、大多康强、生兒育女、仍可操作如常、嬰孩滿月、請喇嘛取名後、卽與小羊羔、任置於地、不知何意、</p>
<p>喪葬爲宗敎及習俗上之傳統關係、至今仍延用火葬·天葬·水葬·地葬·等儀式、喪期約爲一年、不唱歌、不宴會、酒可不戒、因迷信宗教、生前唸經拜佛臨死貴能坐化、否則用繩縛成坐化之樣、委地猶難穏坐、則疑生前無善根、將尸移置帳房犄角、不獻物、不燒香、來賓亦僅吊唁喪主、而不看望死屍、喪主最要責任、即請喇嘛唸經卜葬、若喪主家無人爲喇嘛、則雖盡舉死者之家産、以畀喇嘛、喇嘛尙故意刁難、不肯應命、故番民之爲喇嘛者衆、此實爲一大原因、出喪不用棺木、僅由死者最親人、將尸措出、或用駝載亦可、（番民最忌來賓、將駝拴於帳蓬上）、應採何種葬法、唯喇嘛之命是聽、</p>

<h3>獨立精神</h3>
<p>— 章南邨</p>
<p>中國人多依賴性，都是自小養成，「飯來張口，衣來伸手，」嬌生慣養的，冷熱饑飽，尙要母親當心，倒用不着自己留意，直到長大以後，還是糊裏糊塗，冷熱不知，饑飽不問，只知道依靠父母來生活，甚至東西不知收檢，事情不知操作，自己照管自己猶且照管不了，還能說什麽爲社會爲國家嗎？從這種種上，便無形破壞了獨立精神。</p>
<p>日本的小朋友上學校，距家路途較遠的，多半自己帶着飯去，到吃的時候，已經冷了，也就冷的吃；菜是幾塊蘿葡乾，比較好的是幾塊鹹魚，有這樣的刻苦，正是陶冶他們天眞的自然的獨立精神，正與我國小朋友的習慣相反。</p>
<p>還有一層，我國是遺産制，曾見有些小朋友，只要父母很富有的，他就以爲將來有錢用，不自振作，這種人即或能夠保守，不過是等於一個廢人，何况在這個年頭，眞是「積財千萬，不如薄技在身，」人事變遷，財産難保無意外損失，更加國難嚴重，正待全國一致的同心恊力去挽救，那能這樣自甘暴棄啊。至於外國人的遺産，不一定是留給子孫的，所以小朋友都有獨立精神，國家也就强盛。照此看來，小朋友有無獨立精神，關係國家强弱，由小看大，要把依賴性改掉纔好。</p>
<h3>苦學生范仲淹</h3>
<p>— 寗自强</p>
<p>從前有一個苦學生名呌范仲淹的，他小時候讀書在長白山和尙廟裏，每天煮二升米，放在一個鍋子裏，等待過了一夜之後，粥凝結了，他便用刀劃成四塊，早晚吃兩塊，把鹽菜下粥，這樣的讀書，豈不是困苦到了極點了嗎？</p>
<p>後來中了秀才，便「先天下之憂而憂，後天下之樂而樂，儼然以天下爲己任，」這樣能够負責，又何嘗不是他刻苦讀書得來的呢！</p>
<h3>自信力</h3>
<p>— 矜細</p>
<p>你的算術，功課趕不上他們嗎？老師說你的作法欠通順一點嗎？學期考試時，你有好幾種科目不及格嗎？這學期你留了級嗎？</p>
<p>這眞是極可憂慮的問題。</p>
<p>我希望你不要憂慮，你此後應該竪起自信心來，你要自信你的各門學科要勝過同班，你於學期終了時的考試成績要不落人後。</p>
<p>自信是一種力，可以催促你求進步。</p>
<p>「我的算術成績不好，我自信我要迎頭趕上他們。算題到手，我先把算題的要點捉住，看懂了題意，然後動手演算，第一次演算，錯了，第二次再來，乃至於多次的演算，直到求得正確的答案才罷，並且同時多演算這類算題，務使「熟能生巧。」演算發生困難時，非萬不得已，决不請求人家代解。</p>
<p>「我的作文成績太差，我此後應該多讀書，多看點課外讀物，研究書上字句應用的方法，摘下書中美麗的辭藻；到以後作文的時候，恰當地把這類字句應用進去。</p>
<p>祇要你自信你將不落人後，你必會勝過他人。自信可以激發你的志氣啊！</p>
<h3>我家的貓</h3>
<p>— 眞</p>
<p>那亮晶晶的眼睛，瘦長長的身體，烏黑黑的長毛的貓兒。它好像害怕似的，躱在廚房裏，不敢走出廚房一二步。吃是它的本能，放在桌上的小菜，一不留意，已進了它的嘴裏了。</p>
<p>在吃飯的時候，它偏要吃好東西，隔夜的飯，連嗅都不去嗅。</p>
<p>到了夜裏，可不得了啦。屋子的全部成了老鼠的娛樂塲所了。所以在夜裏，特地把那雙貓捉到屋子裏來，但是有什麽用呢？衣服咬破，聲音依舊是很響，閙得人睡不着。是不是貓和鼠已訂了和平公約了？</p>
<p>「古人說：「貓能管七家。」可是我家的貓一家也不管，恐怕自己也要管不住了。」祖母每每是這樣的唾駡那隻貓。</p>
<p>貓呀！你有了尖銳的牙齒，走路不響的脚，長長的鬍鬚，這都是捕鼠的好利器。爲什麽不會運用？反被人唾駡你懶惰，你自己知道嗎？</p>
<p>貓！你祇知道吃，而不知道做事，養你幹嗎？</p>
<p>小朋友們，你們想想看：「我自己是不是像這種貓。」</p>
<h3>好姐姐</h3>
<p>— 十二歲小學生仲善炎</p>
<p>姐姐待我眞正好，我送姐姐一件大花襖。</p>
<p>襖上繡了一串紫葡萄。</p>
<p>爸爸看見說聲妙，媽媽看見說聲好。</p>
<p>姐姐穿着大花襖張開嘴兒哈哈笑，從此以後待我格外好。</p>
<h3>日光</h3>
<p>日光呀，日光！你已悄悄的爬上東窗。</p>
<p>你給我以温暖。</p>
<p>你使我知道時光。</p>
<p>我想留你多坐一會兒。</p>
<p>但是，你又去得這樣匆忙。</p>
<h3>兒童科學講座透鏡</h3>
<p>— 林蔭</p>
<p>上次我們講到凸透鏡使燭火生倒像的事。這理由非常簡單。試看（圖一）便能明白。透鏡有焦點的作用，所以透鏡的應用很廣大。就是我們的眼中，也有透鏡（圖二）假如没有透鏡，我們就看不見東西，而且眼中的透鏡，可厚可薄，看遠物時，透鏡變薄，看近物時，透鏡變厚。大家不妨試試看，如（圖三）一樣，伸一指在眼前，凝視幾分鐘以後，以此眼看遠方的東西時，就覺得很糢糊，而不清楚，如凝視遠方的東西以後再來看近處，也一定不能看得分明的。但是這透視伸縮不能自由如意的時候，於是有的只便於看遠物，（老花眼），有的只能看近物，（近視眼）都要借用外面的透鏡來帮助。（加戴眼鏡），透鏡用於近視眼的是凹透鏡，用於老花眼的呌凸透鏡。</p>
<p>凸透鏡另用有一種應用，就是利用凸透鏡來做放大鏡。雖然很小的花蟲，用放大鏡來看，就非常清晰，如（圖四）的雪花，我們肉眼所見的，决不是這樣的形狀，但在顯微鏡下一看，却知道它是六出形的花了，於是因了凸透鏡的放大作用就發明了望遠鏡。現在大家都知道望遠鏡的發明者是有名的伽利略。但是給予動機和證實的還是荷蘭安斯特爾當地方眼鏡店裏的學徒，他在無意中通過兩個透鏡來看遠處（圖五），於是就發現了意外的奇蹟，從此望遠鏡就發明了。</p>
<h3>樵夫趙大</h3>
<p>— 吳雄劍</p>
<p>趙大是個樵夫，他每天到山裏捉柴，捉了許多柴就挑下山賣給山下人家，變了錢，再換了許多吃的用的東西上山。</p>
<p>每天，趙大挑下山去的柴是一百五十斤或者兩百斤，但是到山下人家一稱，總比山上稱的多三五斤，他想，他自己是稱的很平的。</p>
<p>他從山下買上去的東西，稱稱總是比山下稱的輕，他想，山下的店家不規矩，常常稱的不足。</p>
<p>實在，小朋友們，我告訴你：趙大的秤是與山下人家一樣的：山下稱的柴並没多出來，山上稱的並没有减少。</p>
<p>那末爲什麽山上與山下稱的有不同呢？</p>
<p>原因就是物理上告訴我們的「離地心愈遠吸力愈少，離地心近吸力大。」吸力少稱的東西輕，吸力大稱的東西就重了。</p>
<h3>日光浴</h3>
<p>— 卞北辰</p>
<p>在普通一般小朋友的心理中，以爲面孔和身體白嫩是非常漂亮的一回事，因此，太陽差不多是他們最可怕的一樣東西了，所以他們輕易受不到日光的洗禮。</p>
<p>然而人類是富有愛美性的，面孔和身體白嫩，就是一種美的表示，不過，我終覺得中國人的美，是病態美；而外國人的美，纔是健康美。</p>
<p>諸位小朋友如果感到病態美是可恥的，那我們不防每天除了運動以外再來舉行日光浴，因爲它能够使我們健康。</p>
<p>日光浴最好在早晨五六點太陽剛纔出來的時候舉行，地點可在曬台上或室内，如在室内，須將窗開啟，使陽光直接照在身上，不必經過玻璃，因太陽之光有三：一爲亮光，一爲熱光，其次爲紫外綫，紫外綫能殺滅病菌，使皮膚變成健康的棕色，如經過玻璃，祇亮光與熱光可入，紫外綫則被阻在外，雖浴亦毫無功用。</p>
<p>小朋友們！東亞病夫的頭銜，是帝國主義送給我們的禮物，我希望諸位小朋友能個個洗日光浴而得到健康美，來將這個可恥的名稱洗掉！</p>

<h3>對國旗的尊敬方法</h3>
<p>— （漢生）</p>
<p>國旗是代表一個國家的旗幟丨也就是代表全國人民的旗幟。凡是國民，都應該尊重國旗，敬愛國旗。這種禮節是爲國民者須知的。然而在敎育這麽不普遍的中國，知道這種普通常識的國民，能有幾人？有些人連青天白日滿地紅旗也不知是何種旗幟！有人竟把國旗當做布篷遮太陽之用！因此：提倡這種普通的常識，在目下是很需要了！</p>
<p>我們要提倡一樁事情，就須實踐工作，空口喊口號是没有用的！所以我們要對國旗尊敬，那末就要照對國旗尊敬的方法，去尊敬國旗：</p>
<p>（一）對國旗行敬禮的時候，須要十分莊嚴。</p>
<p>（二）在國旗升，落的時候，必須立正行敬禮，眼睛要注視着國旗。不得東張西望，或是兩目他視。</p>
<p>（三）無論在什麽時候，我們碰到有人破壞國旗，或是侮辱國旗，就要當以敵人對付。（若是那人是幼小的孩子，或是無智識的人，我們就應加以勸導，並將敬重國旗的理由講給他聽。）</p>
<p>（四）我們在隨便那處地方，看見有抛棄的國旗，我們就應當把他拾起來，若是破舊的，卽行焚化掉。</p>
<p>（五）國旗破壞時，不宜綴補，也不能作他種用途。最好是用火焚化。</p>
<p>（六）看電影或是觀劇時，看見其中有國旗飛揚的時候，我們須立起敬禮。</p>
<p>（七）對國旗有意圖污辱，公然加以損壞除去，或污辱之行爲者，依照刑法第一百六十七條之規定論罪。</p>
<p>（八）行走路中，見有人升，落國旗時，我們也要立定致敬禮。</p>
<p>（九）製有國旗的徽章（或是其他一切物品，）在佩帶時不可下過腹部，最好是佩在左胸襟上，若有别的徽章，須綴在牠的下面。</p>
<p>（十）遇有人家將國旗懸法弄錯了，我們就應該去指正他們。</p>
<p>以上幾條，是我們對國旗須有的尊敬法，希望小朋友們都能實踐，那末眞不愧是一個好國民！</p>
<h3>「今天」和「明天」</h3>
<p>— 冰英</p>
<p>我有一位弟弟，今年十一歲，一天到晚祗知玩耍，蕩鞦韆拍皮球，踢鍵子，甩虎跳……什麽都會，回家後放了書包一溜烟就逃跑了，把學校裏的功課丢在腦後。我說：「你應該讀書了，今天一定要把幾個算術練習題做好！」他却笑嘻嘻地回答我道：「「明天」做吧，我「明天」一定做好！」「明天」，「」明天」，我弟弟總没有把功課做好，結果被老師處罰了。</p>
<p>「明天」這兩個字，我們最好永遠不要想起他，有什麽事，「今天」就做完了，不要延遲到「明天！」因爲「明天」有「明天」的事，「今天」的事延擱到「明天」，就妨礙了「明天」的事，有時還會以「明天」這兩個字來原諒自己，作推託的理由，實際上假如做一件事會想到「明天」，事情就永不會完，也永遠不得完成。</p>
<p>成功的人永遠不曾想「明天」，失敗的人却常常希望「明天」，小朋友們，假如你們要做一個成功的人，就應該把握住「今天」，不要希望「明天」！</p>
<h3>如何救濟</h3>
<p>— 東生</p>
<h3>水中可以懸蛋</h3>
<p>— 敬安</p>
<p>小朋友們！這是一個物理上的遊戲，人人都可試騐。而所費無幾。得到物理上一個重要的原理。</p>
<p>現在把幾件需用的物品預備起來，就是一個新鮮雞蛋，一個高大的玻璃瓶，裝滿了水，還要一包鹽。</p>
<p>先把蛋放進瓶裏，蛋比水重，自然沉到瓶底。現在把鹽慢慢的一點一點放到水裏去，一面把水攪動。等到鹽放到適當分量的時候，那雞蛋就全服從你的命令。你把它提起，放在瓶的中央，你的手只管拿開，它還是停着不動，你再把它提高一些，或者放低一些，它也惟命是聽，不敢自己亂動。</p>
<p>這種現象的原理，說來也十分簡單。因爲鷄蛋的比重比清水大，所以蛋往下沉。水裏加鹽，使清水變成鹽水，鹽水的比重大於清水，鹽加得越多，比重也越大。等到鹽水和蛋的比重相等時，蛋就不浮不沉的停在水中了。假使再加鹽，使鹽水的比重比蛋還大，那蛋就浮在水面了。</p>

<h3>談虚榮</h3>
<p>— 江雪</p>
<p>上了年紀的人和那些年紀雖不大而頭腦古老的人們常常慨嘆現在女子們醉心虚榮把虚榮看作墮落之門；同時、一般前進的，獻身於革命的人們也常常勸人們克服虚榮，從虚榮中解放出來，認爲虚榮是陷坑。</p>
<p>這兩種人從兩個不同的觀點來觀察虚榮，他們對於虚榮的認識是各各不同的。我們至少也得承認「虚榮」是一個嚴重而值得我們考察的問題。</p>
<p>所謂虚榮，我們照字面看來可以知道：大約是指人們追求一種空虚而不實在的榮耀。譬如說，看見張小姐穿那末時式的衣服，就和母親吵閙要剪料子，至少要做到和張小姐一樣出風頭，頂好勝過她，這是虚榮。看見阮玲玉，胡蝶拍影戲給成千成萬的人看，讓成千成萬的人入迷，於是立志要進電影界，這也是虚榮。從這些地方看來，虚榮似乎確是一種空虚的榮耀了；但是我們仔細研究，會得出相反的結論。人們所追求的虚榮，實際上一點也不「虚」，反之倒頂切實，所謂虚榮，不是形而上的，倒是形而下的。</p>
<p>現在的社會是佔有個人形式的社會。是商品生産社會。這一社會的一切財富，是商品的堆積；連「高尙」的藝術家和文學家的作品，人們的勞動力的婦女們的色相，也商品化了。人與人的關係，藉商品與商品的關係而顯現。金屬貨幣成了經濟學上的「一般等價」在商品社會起着一種萬能的，似乎神秘的作用，眩目於一般商品和貨幣的權威之下的人們，「一切爲了交換」是他們的信條。愛打扮，愛搽粉點胭脂，即是把自己商品化了再加以精緻的裝璜；希望出名，喜歡出風頭即是希望將自己這一商品陳列在熱閙的市口，惟有這樣才能很快地脫售，才能賣得好價錢。因此生活在這社會，而對於這社會没有一種正確的，清明的把握，醉心虚榮是必然的。這社會存在，就必然有醉心虚榮的人存在。</p>
<p>尤其說女子虚榮心最大，女子頂相信虚榮，甚至有人說女子是虚榮的動物：但我們的確很少聽見（至少是比較的少）對男子們這樣說。人們說到虚榮，心中就聯繫到女子。這是什麽原因呢？原來現在是男子中心社會，女子是男子的附席和奴隸，現在的婦女，比男子更露骨地商品化，那些站在弱者地位上而不知道自己所站地位的女子，以取得男子的歡心爲生存之目的，以出賣爲職業，社會賦予了她們更容易醉心虚榮的條件。</p>
<p>因此現在的婦女，想從經濟的從屬和男子的從屬三條鐡鏈中解救出來。認清楚這社會，認清楚這環境，認清楚自身在這社會上所站立的地位，將斷送自己的虚榮心結束個一乾二凈實在是必須的。虚榮是陷坑。它絲毫也不能拯救我們，它只是將我們更送下一層地獄，使我們更加附庸化，奴隸化！不過那班滿口世道人心的舊古董和新古董對我們所下的勸告和威嚇，我們必須以覺悟鐡拳去回答他們。遭些强人們，嘴上說得怪漂亮，他們的鬼心眼兒我們是不難知道的：他們駡婦女們虚榮的目的是呌成爲他們榨取，壓迫對象之一的婦女們，向他們領最少的報酬，雖然他們的贓物是巨大得那麽駭人，同時他們想以他們的貪婪和罪物呌我們婦女來負責。（報紙上常常看到化妝品進口的驚人數字，那些人觀破口大駡起來，好像中國之弱，完全由於女子的奢侈和虚榮。）</p>
<p>我們必須要克服虚榮，是爲了我們自己的前程。</p>
<h3>鼓妓</h3>
<p>— 子岡</p>
<p>丨旅平見聞之一丨</p>
<p>每天每天，我按着時間騎車出去，不按着時間回來，因爲回來便是寂寞，守着小屋發楞。</p>
<p>差不多是定規，每當我過街坊的矮矮的土牆時，總喜歡歪一歪𩓐子，瞧瞧那開着的小閂，而只要是早晨，再也不會漏過我眼底的是一個梳着辮子的十六七歲的女孩，時常是穿着一身黑夾襖夾褲在掃院子或洗衣裳。屋子的歪歪的窗欞因年久而帶了黄褐的顔色，土地上開敗了的茉莉悄悄地只剩了緑葉，但在上了燈時，我便找不到這整天在忙碌著的姑娘，門環上總是拿着一把黄銹的鎖。</p>
<p>「那裏去了呢？」我好奇地自問。</p>
<p>直到中秋那天，我獨自個城裏城外繞了圈子回來，自己不覺地已快到午夜，費力地敲着公寓的門，我候着。正巧胡同裏走過來了那姑娘，後面跟着一個老頭兒，手裏拿着絃子，同樣的眉宇與鼻樑告訴我他們是父女，姑娘今天換了件紫襖，在這深夜的小胡同裏只有我們這三個人，默默地交換着視綫，用不着我的車燈，月亮已怪照得清楚的。當老人遲鈍地開鎖時，女孩和我熟識了似的：</p>
<p>「才回來麽？你天天這時候才回？」</p>
<p>「不，今天趁着好月亮，多跑了路。買賣好吧？」我看見她手裏的鼓板，知</p>
<p>道這是每晚沿街賣唱的歌女了。</p>
<p>「今天好一點，平日差多了，空着手回來的時候也有。」她看着老人蹣跚着進去了，便指着那背影：「這是我爸爸，眼睛一半失明了，白天總得多歇着，晚上爲我摸索着出去一趟，靠這吃飯也不容易了。」</p>
<p>我奇怪這姑娘的坦白，端詳着她那對微細然而有光的小眼睛，日光把她額上的幾顆麻粒照得很清楚。額前仍舊覆着一排極短的劉海，我想起北平的鼓妓多半是愛梳長辮的。不思索地：</p>
<p>「爲什麽你不去青雲閣一類的遊藝塲呢？錢可掙得多一點……」</p>
<p>來不及答覆我，便說了明天見，掩門時才提：</p>
<p>「我還没替爸爸舖坑點燈呢。」</p>
<p>二次敲着門環，門房的睡眼死釘着我。</p>
<p>第二天一早走過那兩扇小門時，我被邀了進去。老人躺在裏屋坑上輕咳着，那僅有的一間外屋搭着那妞兒的鋪，望着一個呆板的畫像，我問：</p>
<p>「是你娘麽？」</p>
<p>女孩擦着長板凳，見我這裏看看那裏瞧瞧地便自在了：</p>
<p>「是呵，死了十一年了。我媽比那上面漂亮多了，先頭也是唱大鼓很紅很紅的啦，可就是得了病……」</p>
<p>她招呼我往院子裏走，因爲老人不喜歡重提舊事。她告訴我她爹的固執，不讓她塗脂抹粉地到鼓園賣藝去，寗可父女倆天天串胡同過苦日子，到家來捶腰撫腿的。</p>
<p>打小院子出來，我心頭輕輕地唸着：相「没有花的茉莉啊！」</p>
<p>前兩天才聽門房說起，老人原先是當書記的，一次眼病閙破了這個飯碗，女人死前曾留下話，說是呌女兒把已會的歌曲加點功夫，也能養活半失明的父親了。</p>
<p>然而老人是掘强，不肯呌女兒走上她母親的舊路去磨懷了自己，只在薄幕深宵，在胡同裏輕彈着弦子，靜聽呼喚。他是諳悉了鼓妓的雙重出賣的遭遇了。</p>
<p>每逢晚上自己在燈下讀書時，聽到遠遠近近的弦子鼓板響，或是嘹亮委婉的歌聲，在感到這是一種北國情調之外，我總彷彿瞧見那質樸的姑娘在忍着淚向聽衆訴懷，剖析人生的壯志與苦鬥。她唱的是「大書」，少不了俠義忠孝的。</p>
<h3>閩南惠安的婦女</h3>
<p>— 宇園</p>
<p>在閩南的田村裏，看到壯健的少女拖着木屐，背着大辮子在田野的村道上「踢踢蹋蹋」的走過，或是看到婦人的紅色高底的小脚蹣跚地移動過去，似乎是每天所常見的事。雖然也僅有幾個摩登的女子在頭上失掉了辮子，臉上畫着長長眉毛，擦着胭脂，但這却是與整個閩南婦女的生活無關，她們也同樣地保持着一種依賴，空間與因循的性情。閩南鄕村的婦女，是在一種沿革下來的習慣下滿足地而且悠閒地生活着的。因此，她們求知識的是很少，大部分都祗希望嫁一個洋客（即華僑。在閩南，去南洋經商或是做工的很多，甚至有全村都去過南洋的）或是地位高一點的軍人。已出嫁的婦女在平時就祇燒飯，洗衣，領孩子，她們不像江浙農村女子那樣地在蠶忙或秋收的時候帮着丈夫做各樣的事。如果丈夫在南洋的，更祇是等南常把一些時間消磨在花會，打牌和一些其他不正當的娛樂裏面。</p>
<p>但是，雖然同在閩南的領域中，惠安的婦女是特殊的。惠安婦女的生活和惠安婦女的特性都是婦女問題的絕好資料。也許這也是中國最受到社會鞭撻的低賤婦女中的一羣吧！</p>
<p>惠安，這地方在中國，尤其在閩南是一個奇異的縣。大多數的男子都因在本地不能生活而到閩南的各縣去做工。因爲惠安是緊靠着海，旣没有多量的農田，又没有工廠的設立。因而所有的經濟是不能像一般地建築在農村上；也不能建築在縣城的小工商業上。惠安人在閩南各縣的生活，也正在江北人在江南各縣的生活一機。他們做着最勞苦和最低賤的工作，終年地忙着。泥水匠，木匠，人力車夫，以致理髮匠，小販，這些職業便是惠安大所特有的生活領域。便這樣情形中的惠安男子自然談不到拿錢回家去，於是留在惠安鄕裏的婦女就替代了自己的丈夫，父兄，做着所有的苦役：在僅有的田地中耕種；在海邊的泥水裏蓬頭赤足的捕魚；從這一個地方到那一個地方挑一二百斤的重担；負着各種的東西到城裏去沿街的呌賣；她們的生活即是在那樣地勞役中過着的她們也不考究裝飾，也不像一般閩南婦女的喜歡穿紅。她們祇穿着與紫赤的粗糙皮膚相調和的粗黑土布，梳着大得可笑的髮，有時還包着布。那種樣子和上海的江北茅屋中所能看到的似乎也差不多。不過惠安女子的痛苦確乎是超過於江北女人的。因爲牠之所謂奇異還不止在婦女生活的勞苦；却是表現在夫婦關係的上面。結婚，在惠安女人確是一種神秘而且是太殘酷的事。一個惠安女子的結婚簡直是像一種兒戲或是傳奇中所說的那樣出人意料之外，丨丨在結婚儀式舉行過以後，實際祗能做三五天的新娘就要强制回娘家去了。一直等到在娘家生産以後，方准回去與丈夫永久同居。如果回娘家以後没有生産，那地方的禮敎就不准她再到夫家去。即使在節裏去做客，也不能留上幾天的。否則就要受到禮敎的鄙業和輿論的攻擊。而且鄕村中的男人大都在外縣，回家的機會極少，因此，在另一種的場合下，惠安婦女又被命運决定了是一個性的活屍。她們，就是這樣地永久在經濟和性的雙重壓迫之下被俘虜着被駕駛着的。</p>
<p>幾年來，惠安婦女的自殺却成了可怕的統計。人說：惠安婦女的自殺即是由於性的關係和農村經濟破産以後生活尤形恐慌所造成的。這似乎是近乎是實的。惠安女人丨丨特别是年青女子，約同了好幾個運捆着繩子去聯盟跳井跳海，或是跳河，已成爲一年中必有幾次的事了。而在惠安，則彷彿已經是看慣了的。</p>
<p>惠安婦女在殘酷的舊社會下是一種不幸的，其實，又何止於惠安一個地方呢？在中國的僻壞的田村裏，鄙固的深山中，像傳說中一樣過着殘酬的生活的婦女正多着呢！不過這年頭的小姐們所高唱着的解放運動，也仍祗是爲自己這幾個特殊的高等婦女造地位，而忽略了無數在封建禮敎下生活着的農村婦女。</p>
<h3>現代蘇聯婦女的工作</h3>
<p>— 薛績輝譯</p>
<p>by　Miss　M.E.　Walker　(Contemporary　Rev,八月號）</p>
<p>近代蘇聯婦女的解放，理論上說來，似乎是狠容易的，實際上却只有莫斯科，列寗格勒等城市的情形是與理論相符，其餘較遠的如佐治亞（Ceorgea）及忌拉面斯（Urals）一帶不特男子，連婦女自己最初也，不敢公然承認婦女是比較畜類或家庭中任何可買賣的器具較有價值。</p>
<p>當蘇聯向世界宣佈蘇聯的婦女（從太平洋海岸的海參崴至西方的杜爾拿）此後和男公民是絕對的一律平等，丨丨又論在私人生活或社會生活，在法律之前，同是「工人」丨丨的公文，墨跡未全乾時，政治中心的各大城市中的婦女便起而擔負她們應有的責任了。蘇俄婦女的本性對於事物的眞意義，賦有很能鑑别和許定的能力；所以開始的時候就没有以「平等是不負責的自由」的錯誤觀念。她們的錯誤只是過於使工作和責任支配了她們的一生。</p>
<p>千數百年來，蘇聯婦女一向都被强迫着遏制她們自我的表現和獨立能力的天性。這種她們並未怎樣努力和期望去接受的解放一旦來臨，他們那種久已隠藏着的天才和能力便跟着婦女解放的同情和和諧的音調激發起來。於是産生了一種幾乎令人不敢置信的工作和行政的能力，一種不特婦女本身，並且連她昔日的主人也覺得驚奇的能力。</p>
<p>我們素所景仰的婦女如BrehleBrechkcllelly丨丨蘇聯革命之祖母，被現代蘇俄所咒詛的丨丨及和她在戰前被放逐而流浪在各地的朋友，以前我們把她們看作俄國的非常人物，不是平凡的國民。但和現代的蘇俄婦女一比，優無疑地證明她們不過是常見的例子，在鄕村日常生活中現代的蘇俄婦女是負責改善一切的。成見無論深到什麽程度，若果以爲蘇俄没有沉悶的日常生活，那正是與以全蘇朦朧暗淡的天空中絕無一綫光明者，同樣的錯誤。在丨丨蘇聯，人是要工作才能生活的。有工作的地方，無論那裏，一定見到勞動着的婦女。工作我以爲是不會缺乏的，雖然有些完全是試騐的性質，有些已經依照最近代的歐洲方法而進行，如裝置電氣使所有的村莊城市都化爲光明等工作，更有些則仍在可怖的伊凡時代的情形之下進行。</p>
<p>我首先接觸這種新婦女的地方是在某外國的蘇俄領事館裏，我在那裏取護照的簽證。那裏的職員有一半是女子，而她們工作的效率正和其他兩個只有男職員的領事館一樣。當男職員們正被困於我的無數問題中之際，適當的回答却由那些短髮，裝束單簡，日吸香烟的婦女們中之一個的口裏發出來了。實際上管理這領事館的是她們。我走進那辦事處時，原以爲要等待很久才可以取得簽證，並且打算用一點賄賂，假如需要的話。但是我發現了自從婦女界進了辦公室之後，俄國的辦事效率已增加不少了，而且我的銀錢放在口袋裏還比放在手裏安全。後來，我慢慢詳加觀察，知道這種非法詐取的根苗已被一隊勞工所剷除了，而這隊勞工全是婦女。她們唯一的目的就是撲滅這種社會的惡習。</p>
<p>在别一個領事館裏，我聽說外交官的位置，婦女亦可參加競爭，如果她們的資格是和那些男候選員一樣或比較更好的話。一個戰前的老外交官和我談及婦女們已經表明她們對於國際事業如何能幹；他毫不隠藏地說她們的工作和男子一樣；在某些案件中她們的速率，和直覺力也許還比較來得快密。</p>
<p>俄國也像其他歐洲新興的國家一樣，婦女忍然得到解放的初期，曾受敎育的婦女對於任何的職位都願意參加擔任，不管那些位置是否適合她們的能力。她們試過從事於屠業，建築，工程，劇塲管理，簡而言之即家庭以外的一切工作。不久之後，婦女領袖乃發覺世界上有些事業只適宜於婦女，男子對於些種工作是不適宜或節直没有用的。於是經過一陣狂風暴雨的嘗試之後，她們便引導這種新勞工的偉大力量到現在所進行着的途徑上去，從事改善青年和婦女的體格，道德和智力。那些賦有超人特長的婦女在勞動市塲中可以不靠情面與男子競賣勞力而得到較高的價值。她們現在仍擁佔着各種的位置，如工廠經理，報館編輯，政府機關中的理財員，敎育和社會事業的長官。我想起一個女站長，她眞是一個不平凡的女人，她所做的事非一般俄國男子所能做，她可以使一隊運輸工人自動地做一天很好的工作而不用監工；其意志之緊强不可屈撓，有如白山（Monr　Blane）的斜坡。（持續）</p>
<p>世界名婦人</p>
<h3>馬利奥斯丁（Mary　Austin）</h3>
<p>— 養愚</p>
<p>美國女作家，馬利奥斯丁生於一八七○年，於今年八月十三日逝於山塔菲Santa　Fe年六十五歲。她是美國現代的一女作家，她的理論和技能的成功，不僅使她成爲這時代的名作家，而且是美國女界中的一位偉大的新人物。</p>
<p>在她的自傳，地角天涯Earth　Holizon以及其他的作品中，都充滿了一種眞誠正直之氣。她是一個被軍官抛棄的病孩，但後來成爲一個農人和女權主義的提倡者。她痛苦没有家族情感，她缺乏愛，所以她對已以及對人，只以正義來替代愛。她這多年的歷史和婚姻的遭遇，可說是人間的一齣至痛的悲劇，可是從這種環境裏，却這成了她爲現代的驚異的人物。奥斯丁的人格和樸質的懿範，像一位没有冠冕的女皇，有時似很嚴厲而摰拗，所以她的生命史中雖印着不少的鬥爭的痕創，但是在她的志趣與精神，却給與了她絕大的成功。</p>
<p>這些創痕，在她的著作和生活中，明顯地，呈露着。她的天才，在她結婚後所寫的「微雨中的陸地這是她的詩和戲劇中的最出色的丨一書中The　Land　of　Little　Rain充分地表現了。她在加洲的沙漠度過了十六年，她和一個印度女人般的工作，研究印度的學問和沙漠的特性。研究的結果發表了，日光的陸地Land　ofSun内容的單寫實可驚人，它有精確的植物學的知識和觀察，以及人類與自然環境直接的關係。</p>
<p>奥斯丁看輕母性本能，而熱誠使自己成功爲一個著名的博物學家，人類學家，同時又是一個老練而經騐豐富的文藝作家，後期的作品，寓意更是深刻，她的内心，永没有退縮過，是常常抱着發明和克服的精神。人對她發現的眞理，有些是懷疑的，却是對她整個的心靈，曾不疑惑。她的腦力聰慧健全，而不是偏於情感的或狹窄的。</p>
<p>她深刻地坦白的注意藝術和生活，與注意人民一般。幾年前，她有一篇未署眞名的「自述」，投到一個刋物「民族雜誌」（The　Nation）裏。在那篇文章中，她自稱爲「寂寞的女人」Woman　Aloneo寂寞的意義是眞實而悲傷的。她眞誠的工作充滿了她的生命；她給予人以愛，很多的印度人也報她以愛；因爲她一生都爲印度人而奮鬥的。</p>
<h3>新女性姿態</h3>
<p>— 蘇丹</p>
<p>文明賜與女性開化知識以來，新女性是隨時隨地都出現的，帶着她們的時代色彩和環境基調，表現各種姿態映進人們的耳目，給人們特殊的注意，稱賞，或批評，給社會優良進步的影響。</p>
<p>民國十五年中國大革命時，新女性的産生有如雨後春笋，那是證明新女性的出現，是隨着社會解放並進的。</p>
<p>跟着帝國主義的鐡鎖套上了中國革命的頸項以後，凡屬前進有血性的女子，被殘酷的慘殺摧殘之餘，兇很黑色的魔手，便一把拉着她們後過，製造了幾年來女權開倒車的歷史。</p>
<p>在這婦女開倒車的幾年間，貧窮的婦女越加苦難，生活陷於泥沼中，或忍受資本家加緊的剥削，或飽嘗農村破産流離失所的苦痛。有錢的婦女越對淫威奢侈上用工夫，上焉者蟲一樣地活着，鳥一般地跳着，她們除了修容，貪玩，享受外，不管一切不知一切，幾乎不知道自己是人，因爲她們根本不須要好好地做人；下焉者專靠出賣自己底肉體，兼出賣靈魂爲生，同樣她們所寄生的男人也靠出賣人格，靈魂，出賣民族利益，以至中國民族精神大破産，帝國主義的侵略越長足進步，東北四省奉送了給日本。</p>
<p>這時期，痛恨喪權失地，民族危殆的覺悟女子，曾以新女性姿態出現的，雖然在各方面都有，但事實上都在受難中如星辰一顯便殞没。</p>
<p>女權湮没伴國土淪亡共鳴的喪鐘，還不足以警醒一般人底迷夢；最近且進而尾隨帝國主義瓜分中國緊迫的進攻中，對被壓在青石板下的婦女，更掀起了同今年全中國廣大的旱災水災兵災一樣的兇濤惡浪，一天天加緊對我們女子身上壓迫。大有看女人爲妖孽的氣燄，形成了今年這個，婦女的災年！我們麻木的婦女，也竟綿羊般馴服，承受這些壓迫不敢反抗；或仍在醉生夢死中，加度地墮落着。這是婦女莫大的危機！</p>
<p>自從粤方宣揚，禁止男女同學同行的警號；接着是禁止男女同食同居，禁映男女合演的電影，撤消女子在各機關的職務：接着又是漫駡女子的裸腿赤足……，這些，其目的：無非是想把邊在抬頭的婦女羣，殘酷地置於奴化制度的壓迫之下。所以要粉辭女子底向上心獨立性，尤其要剥奪婦女的地位，一面呌她們回到家庭去，讓出地位好給男子，以圖稍稍緩和大量失業的恐慌；一面更呌婦女回到壓榨機下去，甚至回到三從四德去，連綿地隸屬於男子，隸屬於淫威壓力之下，輾轉屈服在雙重奴隸的桎梏中，凖備做馴服的亡國奴。</p>
<p>不僅如此，還有：復古：哪，便興宗敎，哪，……哪，那些舊把戲逐漸地如浪花潮水，侵凍在日趨滅亡的中國民族面前。這些，又是說明了甚麽？</p>
<p>很顯然地，是帝國主義想使中國完全殖民地化，他們除了用强盜的行爲掠奪之外，更聰明地利用，借刀殺人：這種刻毒的手段。於是帝國主義和它的××者，恊力培植中國的封建勢力，使中國民衆復陷於古老的沼澤丨丨封建的迷霧中，借此愚惑民衆，欺騙民衆，麻醉民衆，敎民衆麻木不仁，不復知解放自由爲何物，而養成凖備做亡國奴的心理。由是中國民衆，只曉得把畢生的血汗，供彼輩的滿足。這是帝國主義對殖民地文化政策的毒辣的進攻！</p>
<p>這毒辣的進攻越深銳，中國還想有新女性出現嗎？縱有新女性姿態顯出來，那時還容許她們幹甚麽嗎？恐怕只有三出其妻，惟女子與小人爲難養也，那些聖賢之道，才是那時最普遍最流行的高調。</p>
<p>由是，可以想見中國婦女的危機，是一天天地深化嚴重化了，中國婦女的危機，和民族危機一樣，已經迫在目前了！我們有覺悟的女子，怎能坐看這一天天嚴重化的危機，不想法子挽救呢？我們不能坐視不管喲！我底火在燒了，我度血在歌着，我底心在跳躍，我底靈在默禱，我默禱於全中國未曾覺悟的婦女前：丨丨姊妹們，醒覺呵！把無能與軟弱，變爲勇敢的姿態；把頽廢跟墮落，變爲精明的能力；把安逸和怠惰，變爲自强的奮鬥；把散沙的性格，變爲合羣的熱力；把嫉妬和量小，變爲無敵的雄心；把虚榮和奢侈，變爲武裝的精神；把依人的奴隸性，變爲獨立的主人公！……以我們婦女羣衆的力量，來解放婦女的危機，拯救中國淪亡！我希望你們都變爲這樣的新女性，以解脫民族痛苦的新女性姿態出現，使這姿態遍佈全中國，比春天飛舞的蝶兒還多。阿門！（未完）</p>

<p>（金雞好二三角）　標紗前市開盤、以美棉微漲數磅音、測其形勢仍軟、而塲中交易頗形清澹、但多數待其回漲一二元、再作營業計畫、故升降甚微、各月略漲一·二·三角、午後日商進近出遠、作掉期交易、市象仍平澹、因現紗二十支銷路甚滯、且售價雖廉、出路仍少、現紗價較標紗爲低、所以漲力仍難也、各月又漲一·二·四·五角、全日成交統計三萬一千七百包、查賣出通記六百包、恒益二千零五十包、均昶一千六百五十包、恊生八百五十包、崇安五百五十包、同和三百包、大昶一千一百包、明德六百包、買進義成四百五十包、吉豐五百五十包、通記六百五十包、大豐二千二百包、愼昌五百包、元泰九百五十包、潤康一千二百包、恊成一千三百五十包、一日間最高低價及收照價列下、</p>

<h3>中外棉市背馳</h3>
<p>美印雖回漲鄭標反疲</p>
<p>日商因有交貨之傳說</p>
<p>棉市又平疲、因價格與紗價比率太高、廠方無力採辦、因之現貨成交頗少、而日商在十月期有交貨兩萬多担之說、於是午後市盤旋轉鬆動、另有一說、某投機者在十月期將多頭了結、狀况殊屬平澹、</p>
<p>（十月棉多頭了結）　標棉前市開盤、外棉微漲數磅音、而塲中賣户未旺、惟十月份多頭了結、市勢絞鬆、結果各月跌五分至一角、午後聞外商有交貨、市况轉弱、各月又跌五分至一角半、全日成交統計九萬四千六百担、查賣出源興昌四千担、益豐一千七百担、愼記二千九百擔、泰興一千三百擔、大孚三千二百擔、吉豐三千二百擔、通記二千二百擔、錦昌一千二百擔、長和二千七百擔、恊生三千六百擔、買進惠康三千三百擔、源大一千二百擔、恒益三千六百擔、明華一千八百擔、愼昌五千擔、元一一千八百擔、長豐七千四百担、同興三千四百担、一月間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<h3>糧食　洋麥成交一船　期粉麥漲而復挫</h3>
<p>粉昨日粉市上午開盤時、承前日漲風、市上人心甚佳、且洋麥期貨貨報漲三五角、而期現粉又爲客帮收買、故開價後近遠一律上升、較大一二分不一、雖有廠空抛出、而空頭抵補與新囤收買、市頗安定、午後洋麥成交一船、由福新辦成、價比上次小五分、爲四元六角二分、此訊遍傳後、卽有福新等大量抛出、價立即突落三四分、後再度盤旋、結果仍見疲落、收市價本月份小一分七五、十一月小二分二五、十二月小三分半、一月小三分二五、二月小二分二五、</p>
<p>麥昨日麥市、洋麥期貨漲三五角、上午開市人心甚佳、近期遠期一律步好一二分、午刻洋麥成交之消息傳佈後、市上即起劇變、多頭了結與新空出檔、競爭甚力、洋麥由福新收辦、價祇四元六角二分、又比前日小五分、午後棉麥在各方競抛之下、價落一角、收市比之前日收價則本月一月各小九分、餘月各小八分、現麥大廠擯守已久、昨小廠亦不問津云、</p>

<h3>南北米市漲跌相反</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨各帮來源、因連朝陰雨、所有新榖、未經日晒身骨潮軟、難礱糙米、以致到頭遽稀、祗有十一二號（貨共近二千石）、乃將半月來疲憊景况、頓能振作、冉冉有上升之勢、售方喊聲旣起、本街反見活絡、更且情島烟台等帮、亦再採辦窑中百哥近二百包、及薄破二百來包、以是形勢頓緊、各貨行情俱起、若窑中百哥等價悉見回高二角、新杜洋尖亦各漲起二尺、僅厚新粳來貨較多、略爲帶緊角許耳、照此情形、新貨在一二朝内似難湧到、而一方面店銷、際此破礱落令、用新已順、或爲一時供求不應、必轉堅昻、若是則今市新貨、或可再有希望、至若各色破礱、雖有包胃動動、然以時已落令、本胃殊寥、故大勢終難有濟、尙帶混局、行情依舊參差不一、其變元去路續滯、猶軟、新陰元亦屬大同小異、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路到船三十號、天時晴正、統市銷塲甚呆、西新更高定中次者價小角外、破更價小一二角、變元胃口微細、其價亦見短小、新杜尖及新陳客尖價形定局、其餘各貨帶軟之勢、惟新羊尖連日貨少、昨市去化尙可、致價提高二三角、東新更價跌二三角、况且無人問詢、</p>
<h3>正陽關新荳上市</h3>

<h3>關於藝術的特性問題</h3>
<p>— 士琴</p>
<p>藝術是什麽？對於這一問題，許多人的答覆都不外是：「藝術是社會現象」，或者說「藝術是傳達思想與感情的一種手段」。這樣的說法，不僅比那說「藝術是人性的表現」或說「藝術是美的表現」的意見要進步得多，而且，在一般的塲合還是非常正確的。不過這正確也只是在一般的塲合有其意義，一接觸到藝術的特性問題，便覺得這樣的說法也有些不够了。因爲一般的說來，無論政治，經濟，哲學，科學，都是「社會現象」，都可以說是「傳達思想與感情的手段」，如果只是以此來解釋藝術，那便是把藝術與政治，經濟，哲學，科學等弄得没有什麽區别，顯示不出藝術之特性了。</p>
<p>藝術與政治，經濟，科學，哲學之不同點是在於：前者是綜合的，具體的描寫，後者則是分析的，抽象的說明；前者是借着活生生的形象的力來組織思想與感情，後者則是借着理解的力來組織思想與感情。所謂藝術的特性，就在這裏。我們知道：無論繪畫，音樂，小說，詩歌……等藝術現象，都是借着活的事物，美妙的形式，技術地組織着一定的社會意識的。没有藝術地組織着的色彩和綫條，便不能稱爲繪畫；坐在鋼琴旁邊，不依據一定的樂譜，只是亂七八糟地隨便彈弄，便絕不會構成音樂的形式；羅列一些政治理論與宗敎敎義，或者排列許多２＋３或Ｘ×Ｙ等數學公式，也一定不能稱爲文學……丨丨總之，無論什麽藝術，都是不能缺少一定的美妙的形式，活生生的形象的力的。</p>
<p>有名的文學批評家居友在其「從社會的見地來看藝術」中說道：「某主人公之内面的悲哀，把它翻做心理學的言語來描寫，比較單純的「他號泣了」這麽來描寫，更能使我們深切地感動，那也是不消說的。除出自己感到悲哀的傾向的人以外，流淚並非感染性之强大現象，淚是感情之終局的結果。不能推測出發生悲哀的原因，且其原因也不能看作是充分有力的，只以眼淚，未必能馬上惹起他人悲哀。」這眞不愧爲大家之言！</p>
<p>藝術必須要使人感動，不能感動人的藝術作品，便是最下乘的甚至不配稱爲藝術作品的東西。但藝術之所以能感動人者，全靠其描寫的力；在同一事物中，在同一的觀念形態支配之下，具有更大的藝術才能，或具有更大的描寫的力的藝術家所創作出來的作品，必然是更要偉大，更會使人感動。可是，怎樣描寫呢？這便觸住了藝術之特性問題。我們已經知道，藝術是以美妙的形式，活的具體的事物來表現人類的思想與感情的。所謂藝術的描寫，當然是要具體，要深刻，不能抽象的說敎，不能表面的叙述，因爲這是不會引起我們極大的感動的。居友了解藝術之特性，懂得必要具體地深刻地描寫才能深切地感動我們，所以他認爲具體地描寫悲哀者的心理，將其内在的悲哀「翻譯做心理學的言語來描寫，比較單純的「他號泣了」這麽描寫，更能使我們深切地感動」。如果要更具體更完善地說，那便是從悲哀者的表情上，行動上以及與其有關係的一切事物中具體深刻地來描寫其悲哀，比較抽象地表面地說「他號泣了」這樣來描寫，是更能感動人的。</p>
<p>在我們的批評界中，有些批評家是完全忽視藝術之特性的。他們對於一個作品，只問其内容之觀念是否正確，不管其藝術的表現力如何；他們常常向一般青年作家說：諸君必要有正確的觀念，描寫的手法只是技術上的問題，並不術批評的價值，而且影響到一般青年作家在藝術上的努力。丨丨這便是不知道藝術是要生動地描寫，忽視藝術之特性的結果。</p>
<p>自然，所謂藝術之特性並不是怎樣神秘的東西，而是要與其所表現的具體的事物，具體的思想與感情聯在一起才能理解的。離開了藝術的思想與感情的内容，便不會有其形式上的特性；什麽也不表現的美，什麽也不表現的形式，是絕對不存在的。如果藝術的思想與感情的内容是來自人類所生活着的社會，不是來自太空，那麽，所謂藝術之特性，最後說來，也是社會所規定的。因此，藝術之特性並不存在於其自身，而是存在於其一般性（社會性）之中：藝術之美的形式，活的形象的力，只有在「藝術是社會現象」一語之下才可理解。</p>
<p>然而，這樣說並不是在否認藝術之特性的存在，而是在說明其意義。因爲藝術之會與其他學科有别，而能獨立成爲一學術部門者，全在其有一定的特性，否則，藝術也就根本不能存在了。</p>
<p>所以，我希望批評家們不要忽視藝術之特性，細心地指導作家怎樣去描寫，不要只圖向作家們背誦一些公式了事；至於一般青年作家，藝術上的修養尤其重要。因爲必須要藝術地完成的作品，才能稱爲藝術作品，否則便是另外的東西。</p>

<h3>集挨</h3>
<p>— 嘉音</p>
<p>安慶通訊</p>
<p>本年五十省三百七十一縣的大旱災，把成千成萬的貧苦農民趕離鄕井，向各地去度他們可慘的流亡生活。「集挨」就是他們一種有組織的流亡「逃荒」的别名。這個字活畫出了災民逃荒生活的集體性和悲慘。「集」字的意思很容易明白，「挨」是「挨步難前」或「挨命」的意思。</p>
<p>解釋了這題目，現在我想就敝處丨安慶及舊府屬六縣丨土著災民和外來災民的逃亡生活一個概要的叙述。今年安慶六縣丨懷寗，桐城，太湖，潛山，望江，宿松丨的旱荒是空前的慘重，本來已是在水深火熱中的農民，至是益發的不能支持了。安慶附廓總舖，冷水，丁家三保農民，前曾結隊千餘人，頭頂枯枝，並抬大龍</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>山龍神入城遊行請願；現在災象早成，他們就不得不各别的去討飯，或成羣結隊的去「集挨」了。討飯對於他們是一件不體面的事，男子很少有去的，女子丨特别是青年女子丨則趁黑夜用手巾包頭偷偷地逃出本境，走遠了人家不認識她們了，她們這才放膽的去乞討。「集挨」則規模頗不同，有僅是集合一兩個村莊一二百人口的「小挨」，有集合一保或一甲千餘人口或二三千人口的「大挨」。「集挨」每家總不祇去一個人；除了留一個老頭子或老太婆「看家」外，幾乎是全家都出動的。「挨」的組織很簡單，「小挨」僅有一個到兩個「挨頭」，「大挨」則除了「挨頭」外，另有一些辦交涉和散發及管理物品的辦事人。「挨頭」大率爲災民所公推，其人多半很孚衆望，又有學問道德，有的甚至在滿清還有「秀才」「舉人」之類的「功名」。他們自己本可不必出來逃荒，不過爲多數災民的利益，不能不出來爲公衆服務罷了。</p>
<p>「集挨」也有一定的手續。災民把「挨」組成後，須先向縣衙門裏請簽發護照，至取得護照之後方可起程。他們到一個地方，先須向當地的區公所裏呈騐護照，然後方可在該境内自由來往。區公所蓋印後，卽開始向該地方派欵。派欵的方法有幾種，有由商家擔任一部分的，有按照田畝公攤的，有向民家徵派的，大率皆由一鄕一保共同擔負。有些農村中有「公産」，負責人爲减輕各家負擔計，有由公欵中提出一部分來作這種用度的。每屆荒年，預料「集挨」的必多，管理公産的人必早爲之計，預先把供應品預備好，以免臨時手忙脚亂。供應品大半爲米，也有給錢的。通常到舊曆九十月就有「挨」到了，到十一月「挨」到的最多，可是他們早就在八九月（舊曆）裏把米舂好了等待着。這供應非常的可靠，區公所只須「飛條」到各村去索，災民馬上就可去拿到手的。這情形在安徽各縣多半都大同小異。</p>
<p>「集挨」的護照上記載的人數常是不符的。比方某一班「挨」本來只有一千人，但爲了想多得供應品，他們未嘗不可在護照上塡上兩千人。好在人多，到一個地方人家不會來替你點名。但到的那地方也决不會按照你護照上的人數派給養。普通多半都打一個七折發給。「挨頭」最初的討價必很高，這時那地方也必定要派一兩個善交際會說話的人來和他辦交涉，把供應品减少至最低限度。必定還有一個正派的紳士來管理銀錢和米榖等事，免得經手人「中飽」自肥，反而災民得不到實惠。</p>
<p>實際，一個災民每天所能得到的也很微乎其少。每人每天大概僅有一升米。這米也有把錢折算的。至於柴火，衣服，地方上大概是不管的，災民得親去拾柴，在田埂上，壩脚下，河邊種種地方挖一個土竃，各自去烹煮。他們没有菜，没有柴，所以常要到鄕鎭間去强取他人所有，因而與當地居民發生衝突的事也屢見不鮮。</p>
<p>一班「挨」很少有能完整的維持到「重返故鄕」的，大半中途走散的多，因爲有些有特别技能的可以靠自己的本領吃飯，比如會唱的，會「打連嚮」的，會武術的，會變戲法的，他們便以自己的技術自活，不願隨着「挨」去長途跋涉了。有些年青女子，特别是會唱小調有姿色的女子，在中途時常會遇到一些闊少和老爺們，她們被誘惑着去委身相事，而從他們那裏取得維持生活以上的報酬。她們初出來時多半是襤褸不堪，一遇到這種機會，她們就馬上可以穿綢着緞。這樣，她們自然就不願隨着「挨」到風塵中去奔波了。因爲沿途走散的多，所以一班「挨」開始時假使有一千人，到第二年三月回家種田時就未必一定能保有三四百人了。</p>
<p>災民向什麽地方去是没有一定方向的。他們必須先打聽什麽地方没有遭</p>

<h3>讀了薄命女士的兩度「呼援」之後</h3>
<p>— 常培</p>
<p>在「一二八」事件中，在野蠻的日本帝國主義的砲彈之下，不知道犠牲了多少中國同胞的生命，不知道摧毁了多少中國人民的家産。現在時間雖已過去了兩三年，但死於日軍暴行下的中國同胞的屍骨，還可在閘北一帶的破瓦殘磚中找到；爲日本所摧毁了家産的中國人民的悲慘的呼聲，更是隨時都在向我們的耳鼓進攻，使人爲之悲憤！薄命女士的兩度呼援，便是這種悲慘現象的具體表現。</p>
<p>薄命女士在其「再度呼援」中說：「我們自從一二八皇軍肆虐，家室被焚，所過的生活直好比懸崖覓路，愈後愈艱，精神上所受的創傷直好比一刀在心，血枯不去。再加上病魔的糾纒，幼兒的號泣，鄰里的白眼，飢寒的迫攻，簡直是生人的趣味已窮，安樂的前途惟死。」這便是他們的境遇的寫眞。處在這樣的悲慘的境遇下，他們一家的生命竟掙扎了兩三年，一直到今天。其中所經歴的苦痛，當然不是外人所能想像得到的。</p>
<p>現在，薄命女士的丈夫可以找到事做，但須有四百元的買命金才行；而窮病已久的他們，又是無法找到這筆大欵的，所以，没有辦法，才將其實際情形寫出來向社會呼援，希望借得四百元錢來維持其一家人的生命。在其兩度的呼援文章中，薄命女士都很眞實地描寫了他們的悲慘情形。我相信，只要是人，看了薄命女士悲慘的呼援文字後，一定都要爲之悲痛流涙的。這並不是因爲她的文章的形式的美好，主要地是因爲她那文章是一羣受了社會的殘酷待遇的人的眞實的悲慘的哀鳴。我敢說，那樣能使人悲痛流淚的文章，只有身歷其境的薄命女士及那與她的生活情形相類似或者對他們具有極大的同情心而又非常了解他們的人才能寫出，那些過着優美生活，具着下流的思想的「天才文人」是寫不出來的。</p>
<p>薄命女士第一次的呼援文字在本刋登出後，不久她就收到了五封完全對他們表同情的信，其中有的是以金錢接濟他們，有的則贈以衣物，有的甚至願將自己的職業讓與他們：這雖然未能解决他們的問題，使他們不得不再度呼援，但由此却可表現人類的偉大的同情心理（並不是一般所謂「慈善家」的假的慈善心理），在中國社會中依然的存在着。至於那些憂世的道學先生們所說的什麽「人性殘忍」，「人心險惡」，我以爲這應該是對那些代表惡劣勢力的人們說才對，在一般人中偉大的同情心是存在的。</p>
<p>對於薄命女士的呼援，我當然是很同情的；至於那些基於人類的偉大的同情心而從各方面去援助她的人，他們更是令人敬佩。不過，我要說，薄命女士所提的問題，並不是她個人或她一家人的問題，而是目前中國的一個非常重大的社會問題：這是絕對不能以一般的呼援與一般的援助這種非根本的辦法來解决的。</p>
<p>薄命女士是爲了窮困，爲了要謀職業，爲了一家人的生命而向社會呼援的，她所提出的問題是窮困，失業的問題。可是，大家想想，在目前的中國，像薄命女士們那樣窮困甚至比他們還要窮苦的人有多少，恐怕是不可計數的吧。又，薄命女士和她的丈夫都是知識份子，懂外國文，工書法，能作文章，其知識能力，當然是在一般水準之上的，但是，現在呢？他們没有職業，他們的衣物，凳子，燒飯的鍋，門上的鎖，都當賣盡了，衣食住都成問題，没有辦法，在向社會一度兩度地呼援了！像他們這樣的人尙且如此，其他如在破産的農村中的無數農民，在城市中許多的失業工人，又將怎樣生活呢？在這樣的情形之下，難道單以一般的「呼援」與一般的「援助」就能解决不知其數的失業者的職業問題和生活問題嗎？即令薄命女士個人和其一家人的問題因「呼援」而得到一時的解决了，那末，整個中國的失業問題，大多數人的窮困問題又如何呢？亦能以「呼援」與「援助」來解决嗎？這只要不是毫無知識的幻想家，我相信絕不會在此作肯定的答覆的。</p>
<p>所以，我以爲「呼援」和「援助」只是一時的補救方法，絕對不能解决問題，是不能常常拿來應用的。</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>災方纔到那地方去。自然他們不會走得很遠，他們不久仍是要回到本鄕來。從安慶各縣出發，他們大半往皖南去的多，去皖北的少。外埠來本境的災民在近年差不多是年年有的，其中以皖北頴州，亳州，壽州，鳳陽各地爲多，湖北黄梅一帶也常有災民入境。不過這一兩年來災民逃荒集挨的權利也遭到限制了，因爲災民的大羣時常要閙事，因此請求「集挨」的護照縣裏常不給簽署。由是災民更將要墜入飢餓和死亡的深淵裏了。「壯者走四方，老弱塡溝壑」，這大概就是災民們的可悲的命運吧？</p>
<p>大上海風光</p>
<h3>第一托兒所參觀記</h3>
<p>— 毓英</p>
<p>一天早晨，太陽照在地平綫上，我獨自在陽光浸潤着的碎石路上走着，走着；約携一刻鐘的光景，「第一托兒所」幾個斗大的黑字便呈現到眼簾……</p>
<p>從一條狹長的衖堂進去，走不多遠又見有一塊狹長的木製的長牌，寫着：「上海兒童幸福委員會第一托兒所」的字樣。</p>
<p>我剛踏進那高大的黑鐡門，一個穿黑色制服的警士便走向前來向我招呼：「先生，要看誰？」態度顯着非常和藹。</p>
<p>「你們所長來了麽？我想看看他。」我說着便授給了他一張名片。</p>
<p>「哦！你是來採訪新聞的麽？所長還有一會才來，你先請到裏面坐一坐好了。」他看了看我的名片，便領着我進去。</p>
<p>我緊跟着他轉了兩個灣，才看到一所三開間的中式的房屋；在那門口栽着不少的花木，還有石條砌成的長橙，頗像一座小小的花園。</p>
<p>那個警士先走進去把名片交給了另外一個門丁，他便和我招呼一下走了。</p>
<p>我望着他點了點頭便跟着門丁進去了。這間一連三開間的房子雖不比大洋房那麽堂皇，却是不久以前才造起來，所以裏面一切全是新的。一進門就是天井，光綫非常的充足，打掃的也還乾凈；天井中間裝着一座兒童乘坐的轉盤，有馬，飛機，安樂椅都在那上面，一次可以乘坐四個兒童。另外還有脚踏車，蹺蹺板，鞦韆等各種運動器具。從天井走過便是客堂了，當我進去時那裏坐着有二十多個兒童，一齊露着驚異的眼光注視我這個生客；我看着那些兒童各種不同的表情，不禁哈哈地笑了。</p>
<p>門丁招呼我在客堂裏坐下，告訴我所長要到十一點鐘才來。</p>
<p>這間客堂的佈置在簡單中頗有點雅緻；旁邊擺着兩張大沙發椅，雪白的衣子罩着，好像一個醫院的病房。牆上靠東一面掛着吳市長和敎育局長五張照像，另一面却盡是幾張兒童家屬狀况的統計圖表。在那第一張表上記着每個兒童的姓名，籍貫，年齡，性别，家庭狀况，父母的職業。第二張便是在這裏的兒童家屬的職業分類，現在就把它抄在下面：</p>
<p>學界　　二十五人</p>
<p>商界　　十八人</p>
<p>工界　　二人</p>
<p>電影界　三人</p>
<p>政界　　七人</p>
<p>司法界　三人</p>
<p>警界　　二人</p>
<p>這裏的總額祇收六十名，照這張表上看來名額已經是滿了。</p>
<p>時間過得飛快的，僅這一間房裏都還有東西没有看得清楚，這裏的所長就來了。</p>
<p>彼此寒睻了一陣，我這才開始說明了我的來意。</p>
<p>他微微地一笑，望着我說：「這裏一切發展得很快，名額在幾個月以前就已滿了；可是每天到這裏來要我們替他照顧孩子的來要我們替他照顧孩子的人，也不知道究竟有了多少。你看丨」他說時捧了一大疊簿子給我，「這幾本登記簿上都登滿了，一時簡直想不出好的方法來滿足愛護托兒所的人們的慾望，我們覺得抱歉的很。」</p>
<p>我一面聽着他的說話，一面把簿子翻開來看着，見這幾本簿子上已經登記了三百多名，的確是不容易想得出方法來容納這麽多的人。</p>
<p>「照這樣看來，楊先生何不再添設一所呢？」我說。</p>
<p>「我也這樣想過，可是經費呢？拿現在這六十名兒童的收支來比較，每月至少要賠出五百元。我們這裏的開支是遇事節省，自己在這裏是純盡義務。職員一共是有十來個人，可是大家担任的職務都非常的繁重，而待遇也並不比别的職業豐厚；其所以大家都能盡職的原因，完全是堅强的意志和融洽的精神的維繫。」他面露笑容，侃侃地說着。</p>
<p>我看着時間不早，便站起身來向他要求參觀一回。</p>
<p>「可以，可以。」他連忙跟着站起來。</p>
<p>在客堂後面便是兒童盥漱室，靠牆放着幾架高大的木櫉，當中攞着兩列長方形的洗臉的木架，共有十二隻面盆，靠窗子的一面短牆下掛滿了許多手巾牙刷漱口杯一類的東西，編好一二三的號碼。孩子們早上洗臉完全是自動的，保姆祇在旁邊負着監督的責任。盥漱室對過是飯堂，所有的桌椅都適合於兒童的高度；每人一張桌奇，並齊的排着，和課堂差不多的樣子。當我們走進這裏，敎室裏的琴聲鐺鐺地響了起來，那許多孩子便都站起來按着拍子朝飯堂裏走來。</p>
<p>他望着我笑了笑説：「我這裏對於孩子敎養的方法和他們家裏的母敎是稍有點不同；你看，没到吃飯時他們並不像在家裏一樣吵着要飯吃，等飯擺好了，祇要把琴一按，他們就都來了。」</p>
<p>孩子們進了飯堂，各人找着固定的坐位，一聲不響的吃起來；我看着這種情形不禁也笑了説：「楊先生，這些孩子恐怕都是中國將來的軍人的典型，不然，我想不會有這樣好的紀律吧？」</p>
<p>從飯堂出來，看了看洗浴間；裏面有三個蓮蓬龍頭，另外還有四只小洋盆，設備和大人洗浴間差不多齊全的。</p>
<p>由洗浴間出來便到樓上參觀一下，佈置的清潔也和樓下一樣；樓上共闢三間臥房。從初生的嬰兒到六歲的孩兒共分三級，各佔一間。兩歲至六歲的有二十四個，每人一張小黑鐡床；床的一端掛着一件睡衣和一條手巾，這是預備孩子哭時用的。初生至兩歲的孩子最多，也是每人一張床，設備和前者差不多，不過看護人多了幾個。她們大都是富有經騐，對於看護孩子都非常的細心。另外還有三個奶娘，專哺一些先天不足的孩子，因爲牛奶的效力究竟不及人奶。</p>
<p>各處參觀了以後，我覺得這種「托兒所」的設備已經是十分科學化了；後來我同他走下樓梯時，我嘆惜着説：「這種設備的確太好了，祇是名額太少了一點！」</p>
<p>「是呀！這是没有辦法的。孩子愈收的多，經費就更大了；照現在的情形，我們已經感到不能支持，可是對於孩子的待遇却依舊是一樣。我們祇求能把這幾十個孩子養得好，就算問心無愧了！」</p>
<p>從他那裏出來，太陽已經當空了；我這才感到肚子還是空的，便馬上搭車子回到我的寓所。</p>

<p>名人訪問記</p>
<h3>文學名人沈從文印象記</h3>
<p>— 周樂山</p>
<p>這篇印象記的腹稿，是在三年前打就的，直到今天纔能了我的心願，在這秋雨之夜，我是怎樣的懷念着沈君啦。</p>
<p>沈從文君底作品給我的認識，是在許多年以前，那時剛走出大學同時走入一個内地的中學去敎書。那兒是一個長江上游的重鎭。有好山水，所缺乏的是書籍，那兒學校的圖書館裏，只有幾部綫裝書和一份「小說月報」；因爲學生好閙風潮，時常罷課之故，爲敎職員者，乃恰與諸葛亮的生活相反：「食飽事閒」。</p>
<p>我就是在那個時期裏，在某期的小說月報上讀着沈從文君的「十四夜間」。</p>
<p>十四夜間給我的印象是頗好的，令我震驚着沈君的天才。不久，我離開了那個古城，在長江和珠江沿岸各城市輾轉流離的生活着，當那偶爾憇息之時，也陸續地讀了不少的沈君的新著；然而一直到一九三○年定居上海時，仍無緣與沈君一見。</p>
<p>就是在那年的五月間，往中華職業敎育社訪查士元君，偶談及沈君就住在附近，於是因查士元君和沈君是曾相識的這點因緣，乃造成了那次的訪問。</p>
<p>那時，沈君賃　在吕班路上一家俄國菜館的樓上，誰也想不到一位作家會住在這種地方的。問明了菜館的老板之後，乃和士元君爬了不少的斗峭的扶梯，纔達到沈君庽居的三樓。</p>
<p>當士元君用手指敲門時，我臆度中的沈君一定是一位魁梧奇偉的青年了；因爲我讀了他不少的如「入伍後」一類的作品之故。豈知迎出來的，乃是一位瘦小的沈君。</p>
<p>大家入室坐定之後，他和士元君閒談，我乘此瀏覽室内的景物；是一間斜方形的臨街樓，窗前堆滿了木刻的舊書如彈詞之類，没有書架，只有一張寫字檯和一張鐡床。</p>
<p>沈君正在和士元君談到徐志摩；「志摩的母親死了，你知道麽？」他問。「知道的，我已得着了訃聞。」士元答。沈君於是轉而問我：「周先生近來寫點什麽東西？」「没有寫什麽，只寫了幾本兒童文學書；寫小說還是去年在南京的事。沈先生在寫什麽，近來？」我答。「已有兩個月不動筆了，賣稿子是最危</p>
<p>險的事，兩個月不動筆是不稀奇的。」沈君說。</p>
<p>沈君一面説，一面在用毛筆寫着字，隨便的寫，不斷地寫着。</p>
<p>另外大家還談了一點文壇上的事，時間已是十二點以後了。沈君堅留我們吃午飯，我覺得初次見面的叨擾是不安的，預備辭了出來。而沈君不肯，且堅要我們點俄國菜，說：「我要住在這個菜館樓上，就是爲的這個緣故，吃飯最方便。」</p>
<p>在吃飯時，又談了不少關於胡也頻和丁玲的話，因爲沈君和胡丁是好友。後來讀到沈君的記丁玲，我更知道得詳細，知道沈君是一個那樣熱情的友人。</p>
<p>大約又過了一個月的時光，有一天和傅彦長先生與查士元君從霞飛路的一家咖啡館裏出來，傅先生説：「有許久没有去看沈從文君了。」傅先生又説：「沈君眞是一個耐人尋昧的朋友。」</p>
<p>那時正下着大雨，於是雇了人力車，往吕班路去作第二次的訪問。</p>
<p>一跑進去，沈君就説：「我預備明後天動身到北京去。」我説：「那眞來得巧了。」沈君的書室，正是預備動身的樣子，較前更凌亂了。沈君正從外面買東西回來。我看他床上堆了許多從永安公司買來的包裹。</p>
<p>彦長先生問他：「爲什麽要到北京去，在上海不好麽？」沈君答道：「北京的公庽可以賒賬，這是我到北京去的唯一理由。」我插嘴說：「在上海賣文不是較便當麽？」沈君只是搖搖頭。</p>
<p>他還是和前次一樣，一面伏在案前寫字，隨便的寫，隨寫隨扯，抓作一團，丢在地上，滿地都是字紙。</p>
<p>士元是一向不大説話的，他問士元：「你知道志摩的消息没有？」（按：那時徐志摩尙未遇難。）「大概已回北京去了吧？」士元答。沈君一面搬出許多蘋菓來，説：「我們來賭，誰吃得多，我是吃十個不爲奇的。」因沈君催促，和士元每人吃了兩個，彦長先生祗吃了一個。沈君說：「你怎麽只吃一個？那不行，怎麽如此不中用，非吃兩個不可！」把長厚的彦長先生窘得臉紅了。</p>
<p>那時窗外的雨還没有住，我和士元君因有事先辭了出來；不知彦長先生第二個蘋菓吃下去了否？</p>
<p>沈君是一位那樣熱情而又那樣精幹的人，四年後的今天，當寫這短文時，還躍然在我眼前似的。</p>

<p>— 壯圖</p>
<p>李　他們不敢丨丨我也决不會放過他們丨丨</p>
<p>七爺　要這樣才對呀！</p>
<p>李　就是他們窮得去賣老婆，我也不會放過他們的。（一面打算盤算賬）一六如六，三下五除一，九退一進一，八上三除五進一……</p>
<p>七爺　怕的是將來賣老婆没人要，賣不出錢。你總得兇點！（到内室去）</p>
<p>李　當然！（拿起賬簿和算盤，看見四面無人，突轉一個輕佻的態度向桂珍奸笑，並用一手托她的下腮，親切地輕聲地和她說話）你爸爸欠的錢是不要緊的，並且我還可以丨丨</p>
<p>桂珍　（推開他的手）别那末丨丨外面有人……（遠處有說話聲）</p>
<p>李　（誇讚她）很漂亮。（向裏間走，停步，回遇頭來）倒一碗茶進來。（進裏間）打着她，她不得不屈服了。她倒了一杯茶送進去。）（說話聲，笑聲，脚步聲。）</p>
<p>王氏　（在通内室的門口出現，笑嘻嘻地向什麽人説話。）下次可不許你帮她說話。</p>
<p>七爺　（說着進來）聽你的話就是了。……我是因爲這末熱的天，不願你爲了吵嘴傷害了你的身體……</p>
<p>（裏間裏忽起了桂珍的異樣的尖呌聲，接着她頭髮蓬亂她奔出來，帶着極驚懼的表情。後面跟着李先生，一臉兇光殺氣，眼裏冒着野獸似的慾火和怒火。迨看到門口兩人時，忽變爲敎訓她的口氣說話）</p>
<p>李　（敎訓桂珍）一二十歲的人一點事不會作，好意告訴你，還有意和你撇扭，不肯聽話……像你這樣的人也配拿作工來抵賬錢的嗎？眼看着你爸爸哥哥付不出錢，虧我在七爺面前說了許多好話，才肯暫時不要你爸爸還錢，而收用你這不中用的貨，你倒還以爲人家少不得你丨丨</p>
<p>七爺　到底是怎末一回事？</p>
<p>李　她丨她丨她丨不會作事，不聽話，……她在裏間裏打掃，弄得滿屋子灰丨桂珍　不是的！</p>
<p>李　（壓她）不是的是什麽丨是什麽丨你説！你説！滾回去，你這種不中用的貨！（匆忙進裏間）</p>
<p>七爺（也帮着罵桂珍）做錯了事還不認錯！</p>
<p>王氏　（拉他衣角）傻瓜！你什麽也没有看出來嗎！（咬他的耳朶說了幾句，作手勢指指裏間，指指桂珍）懂嗎？</p>
<p>七爺　（點頭）呵！原來……</p>
<p>桂珍　（會意）是的。他抱我……</p>
<p>李　（怒氣冲冲出）别聽她的話！（帶了賬簿算盤出去）我去找你的爸爸哥哥來算賬！（向外面走去）</p>
<p>王氏　（望着李出去）男子都是壞蛋！</p>
<p>桂珍　（訴說）他抱我……我不肯……他就……</p>
<p>王氏　我全知道了。</p>
<p>七爺　（若有所悟）原來他是爲了……難怪他那末主張一定要桂珍來。</p>
<p>桂珍　他黑心，打錯了主意。我們窮雖然窮，我們身子可是清白的。</p>
<p>七爺　話不是這末說的。……在早災中一個窮女子實在值不得什麽。我在報上看到，在陜西甘肅的旱災中，人家用一二十塊錢就可以買到一個一二十歲的女子。一歲僅值一塊錢。像你爸爸欠了我六十塊錢丨丨</p>
<p>桂珍　（更正他）二十塊錢。</p>

<h3>American Ambassador Visits Nanjing to Bid Farewell, Acting Foreign Minister Wang Hosts Farewell Banquet</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The American Ambassador to China, Johnson, returned to his country for vacation. He arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai by night train on the evening of the 5th to bid farewell to our authorities. He arrived in Nanjing at 7:00 AM on the 6th. American Consul General Peck and others went to the station to greet him. After the ambassador arrived, he visited Acting Foreign Minister Wang and Tang Youren at 11:30 AM to bid farewell. Wang then hosted a farewell banquet at his residence, and heads of various departments and commissions were invited to accompany him. In the afternoon, James visited various friends to bid farewell, and at 7:00 PM, he attended a banquet hosted by Navy Minister Chen Shaokuan. At 11:00 PM, he took a night train back to Shanghai to board the President Hoover to return to the country. According to James' conversation with a reporter from the Central News Agency, "I am scheduled to return to my country on the 9th for vacation and came to Nanjing to bid farewell to your country's authorities. During my absence from China, the embassy affairs will be handled by Counselor Gauss." The reporter asked when the United States would respond to our protest regarding the silver policy and the US government's opinion on the upgrade of the embassy. He replied that the embassy had not received any telegrams, so they were currently unaware of anything. According to Consul General Peck, Ambassador Johnson has been in China for four years, and according to regulations, he needs to take a four-month vacation, so he is returning to his country for a trip and also to visit relatives. He plans to return to his post next spring. Regarding the investigation of the arms commission case, it is currently under thorough investigation. The case will have to be submitted when Congress convenes next spring. In addition, the revision of the Sino-US commercial treaty is still under study. (6th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) American Ambassador Johnson said when he arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 6th, "I have been away from the United States for a long time, and I am asking for leave to return to my country for a visit. I am about to depart, so I came here to bid farewell to President Wang and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs." A reporter asked him about his opinion on the silver policy. James replied, "This issue is entirely a matter for experts, and everything is decided by Washington, so I have no opinion to express." Regarding the United States' reply to China's protest against silver, he said that the matter was being handled directly by the Chinese Minister to Washington with the US government. Even if there is a reply, it will be forwarded directly to the Chinese authorities by the Chinese Minister to the United States and will not go through the American Embassy in Beiping. A reporter asked again whether the United States had the same intention as Italy to upgrade its embassy. James replied, "This matter is under the jurisdiction of the government. I do not know whether it is prepared to upgrade in the future." (6th Special Dispatch)</p>

Then, Chiang explained the plan to eliminate the remaining bandits in the border areas, which he had discussed with Zhang Xueliang, and gave instructions on the essentials of bandit suppression and related matters. Then, he sought the opinions of the generals on eliminating the remaining bandits. The generals all stated their past experiences in bandit suppression, gains and losses, and advantages and disadvantages. Finally, Chiang instructed that the remaining bandits must be eliminated in the shortest possible time, so as to fulfill the military's duty and live up to the trust of the country and the people. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM. (6th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>(Xiamen) The headquarters received a victory telegram from the front at noon on the 5th, stating that on the morning of the 4th, our 〇th Column attacked and advanced from Zhongwucun west of Minnan Shanba. The pseudo-9th Army occupied the high ground northwest and west of that place. The pseudo-24th Division was behind them. The bandits stubbornly resisted by building fortresses on the high ground. There were many landmines in front of the position. After a fierce battle until 2:00 PM, the bandit position was completely occupied by us. More than 200 bandits were killed, and dozens were captured. Once the dense fortresses there are built quickly, we will continue to advance.

<p>(Xiamen) A letter from Liancheng on the 2nd states that the reporter went from Longyan to the front line for inspection again. He arrived in Xinquan in the afternoon and saw goods being carried back and forth, with a continuous stream of people and busy military transportation. Trucks carrying grain and ammunition were endless. The bridgehead bunkers along the way have been built, and the rear defense is even more consolidated. Many refugees have returned to Liancheng, mostly the old, weak, women, and children. I stayed in Xinquan for three days, and one afternoon I went to Liancheng. After driving for more than an hour, I passed Pengkou. From Pengkou to Liancheng, there was a section of the road that was damaged due to disrepair, and the car was delayed until late at night. Inside and outside the city walls, the lights could be seen faintly, unlike the dark and lightless night in the past. On the 2nd, I toured the streets and markets, and the business of the shops was still good. The situation was slightly more lively than when the reporter first arrived a month ago. Seventy percent of the people have returned, but the northwest corner is still deserted, with nine out of ten houses empty. There has been no incident in the area for a month, and the residents are living peacefully. Our army will attack Hetian within days. Zhongwucun is the gateway to Changting, and its vicinity is where the main force of the bandits is located. We have already obtained it, so it should not be difficult to drive straight in and reach Changting. (6th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3>The Draft Constitution Stipulates That the Legislative Yuan Has the Right to Question</h3>
<p>The Legislative Yuan Continues to Discuss Chapter Four of the Draft Constitution</p>
<p>The Method of Electing Legislative Members is Passed</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan continued its meeting at 9:00 AM on the 6th to review the Draft Constitution. Sixty-nine members, including Zhu Hezhong, attended. Chairman Sun Ke declared the meeting open and stated that they would review Article 63 of Chapter Four, Section Three, of the Central Government, the Legislative Yuan. After the statement, Secretary Tang Shiwei read Article 63: "The Legislative Yuan is the highest organ of the central government exercising legislative power and is responsible to the National Assembly." Sheng Zhenwei spoke, saying that the word "highest" in the article seemed to imply that there was a "lowest" or "second highest" distinction, while there was only one Legislative Yuan in China. He advocated deleting the word "highest." Fu Bingchang and Zhong Tianxin said that the word "highest" should not be deleted because there were "highest," "second highest," or "not high" distinctions. Chen Changheng advocated not discussing it. Deng Hongye also believed that deleting the word "highest" was meaningless. Liang Hancao advocated maintaining the original draft. Zhang Zhihan said that the first sentence of this article explained the nature of the Legislative Yuan, and the last sentence explained the responsibility of the Legislative Yuan. It would be better to divide it into two articles to make the meaning clear. Wei Tingsheng said that there was no need to divide it into two sentences. Fu Bingchang said that the Legislative Yuan and the Supervisory Yuan were representative systems, and all events were the responsibility of the entire body. This was different from the nature of other Yuans, so connecting them into one sentence was not an obstacle. As a result, it was still passed according to the original draft. Article 64: "The Legislative Yuan has the power to deliberate on bills, budgets, martial law cases, amnesty cases, declarations of war, treaties of peace, treaty cases, and other matters concerning important international affairs." Zhou Wei said that this article should be supplemented because the committee of the National Assembly had been abolished. When there were improper national policies or administrative measures, the Legislative Yuan should submit questions to the President. If the President's response was considered unsatisfactory, a temporary National Assembly should be convened with the attendance of more than three-quarters of all members and the approval of more than two-thirds of the attending members to decide whether or not to impeach. Therefore, this article should have a provision for the right to question, so that the powers of the National Assembly committee could be accounted for. Sun Ke said that only political organs could exercise this right to question. After the National Assembly committee was abolished, this right to question should belong to the National Assembly. It should not be transferred to the Legislative Yuan because the National Assembly committee was abolished, so as to avoid blurring the boundaries between political power and governing power. Li Zhonggong, Gu Zhenggang, Chen Changheng, Fu Bingchang, etc. all spoke. Liu Kejun agreed with Zhou Wei's opinion and advocated adding the right to question. Lou Tongsun said that questioning had the nature of questioning. If the questioning of the policies of administrative leaders had a satisfactory result, there would be no problem. Otherwise, there was a fear of a vote of no confidence. Zhong Tianxin said that the right to question did not need to be stipulated in the Legislative Yuan. It would be better to give this right to the Supervisory Yuan, so that impeachment could be carried out if the questioning was unsatisfactory. Tao Luqian said that the effect of the right to question was too small, so there was no need to stipulate this right in the Constitution. Wei Tingsheng advocated dividing the powers of the Legislative Yuan into various sections so that its powers would be clearly defined. He also believed that the right to question could be stipulated in the Constitution. Liu Guanxun said that the Legislative Yuan's right to question could make the opinions of the various Yuans harmonious and the spirit mutually connected. Fu Bingchang said that there were two types of questioning cases: (1) Questioning policies, which belonged to political power, which the National Assembly could exercise, and the Legislative Yuan could not exercise this power; (2) Questioning in the current Organic Law of the Legislative Yuan. This type of questioning was a legal case deliberated by the Legislative Yuan. If various Yuans did not implement it, the Legislative Yuan could question them. This right was a right that the Legislative Yuan should have and did not interfere with policies in any way. He did not approve of stipulating the right to question in the Constitution, but he agreed to stipulate it in the Organic Law of the Legislative Yuan. Chen Changheng said that questioning was prior supervision, and impeachment was subsequent supervision. If the right of prior supervision was given to the Legislative Yuan, it could avoid the political turmoil that occurred afterward. Li Zhonggong said that the right to question could be stipulated in the Organic Law of the Legislative Yuan. Sun Ke replied that there were two natures of questioning, such as the right to question in the British Parliament, one belonging to political questioning and one belonging to administrative questioning. If someone raised an issue regarding administrative questioning each time the parliament met, the person in charge of the relevant agency would answer it. A certain function was political disclosure, so the nature of the right to question should be distinguished clearly. If it was regarding administrative questioning, it could belong to the Legislative Yuan. If it was regarding political questioning, it might not be necessary. Chen Changheng said that when the Legislative Yuan questioned the Executive Yuan, it could attract the attention of the people across the country. Wei Tingsheng advocated that the right to question should be stipulated in the Constitution. Lin Bin advocated adding Article 16 of the current Organic Law of the Legislative Yuan, "Regarding the implementation of the resolutions of the Legislative Yuan, the Legislative Yuan may submit questions to the various Yuans and the various ministries, commissions, and committees of the Executive Yuan," to the Constitution. At this point in the discussion, the chairman put it to a vote. Most of the members approved that the Constitution should stipulate that the Legislative Yuan had the right to question the various Yuans. In addition to passing Article 64 according to the original draft, another article was added as Article 65. The original text is as follows: "Regarding legislative matters, the Legislative Yuan may submit questions to the various Yuans, ministries, commissions, and committees." Article 66: "The Legislative Yuan shall have one president, with a term of four years, who may be re-elected." Article 67: "During the adjournment of the National Assembly, if the president of the Legislative Yuan leaves office for some reason, the Legislative Members shall mutually elect an acting president." The above two articles were passed without objection. Article 68 was about the election of Legislative Members. Yang Gongda, Gu Zhenggang, Lou Tongsun, etc. all had amendments. The members expressed many opinions until 12:00 PM. The chairman announced the adjournment and designated Lou Tongsun, Gu Zhenggang, and Yang Gongda to be responsible for reviewing the amendments and drafting opinions based on the opinions of the members and submitting them to the meeting for continued discussion. (6th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan continued to meet at 2:30 PM on the 6th to review the Draft Constitution, Chapter Four, Section Three of the Central Government, Articles of the Legislative Yuan. First, Article 69, "The term of office of Legislative Members is four years, and they may be re-elected," was passed according to the original draft. Next, Article 70, "The Executive Yuan, Judicial Yuan, Examination Yuan, and Supervisory Yuan may submit bills to the Legislative Yuan regarding matters under their jurisdiction," was discussed. Some members advocated deleting it, but the result was still passed according to the original draft. After Article 70 was discussed, Article 68, the election of Legislative Members, was discussed again. The amended version was passed after the second reading. The original text of the amendment is as follows: Article 68, "Legislative Members shall be elected in accordance with the following provisions: 1. National representatives elected by the provinces, Mongolia, Tibet, and overseas Chinese nationals shall hold a preliminary election and submit a list of candidates to the National Assembly according to the following quotas. The elected candidates are not limited to National Representatives (1) Provinces with a population of less than 5 million shall have 3 representatives per province; provinces with a population of more than 5 million but less than 10 million shall have 4 representatives per province; provinces with a population of more than 10 million but less than 15 million shall have 5 representatives per province; provinces with a population of more than 15 million but less than 20 million shall have 6 representatives per province; provinces with a population of more than 20 million but less than 25 million shall have 7 representatives per province; provinces with a population of more than 25 million but less than 30 million shall have 8 representatives per province; provinces with a population of more than 30 million but less than 35 million shall have 9 representatives per province; provinces with a population of more than 35 million shall have 10 representatives per province; (2) Mongolia and Tibet shall each have 6 representatives; (3) Overseas Chinese nationals shall have 6 representatives; 2. The President of the Legislative Yuan shall select those with specialized knowledge and experience and submit a list to the National Assembly for election. The number of such representatives shall not exceed one-third of the total number in the preceding section." A new article was added to the draft, "When the Legislative Yuan is in session, the ministers of the various ministries and the chairmen of the various commissions of the Executive Yuan shall attend ex officio." Fu Bingchang first reported the reason for adding this article, saying that the five Yuans are all organs of governing power, and they should cooperate closely, especially the Legislative Yuan and the Executive Yuan should communicate and liaise with each other. The method of communication and liaison is that when the Legislative Yuan is in session, the heads of the various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan shall attend ex officio. When the Executive Yuan is in session, the Legislative Yuan may also attend. After research, because the Legislative Yuan has the final decision-making power, if the Legislative Yuan members attend the Executive Yuan meeting, they will definitely feel difficulty when making the final decision. Jiao Yitang, Zhang Zhihan, Luo Yunyan, Wang Xiaoying, He Sui, etc. strongly advocated deleting this article to maintain the spirit of legislative independence. Tao Luqian, Liu Guanxun, and Wei Tingsheng advocated maintaining the original draft, saying that if someone from the Executive Yuan attended the Legislative Yuan meeting, they would not have the right to vote and would not infringe on the legislative power. Also, if someone from the Executive Yuan attended the Legislative Yuan meeting, Legislative Members could question them face-to-face if they had doubts about administrative matters. This was a good method. The chairman put it to a vote, and the majority voted to delete this article. Then, Article 71 was discussed and amended to "1. The President may, before the promulgation or execution of a bill passed by the Legislative Yuan, submit it for reconsideration; 2. If the Legislative Yuan, for the bill submitted for reconsideration in the preceding paragraph, maintains the original bill with the approval of more than two-thirds of the members, the President shall promulgate or execute it immediately." After the second reading was passed, Article 72, "The President shall promulgate the resolutions sent by the Legislative Yuan for promulgation within 30 days after the arrival of the bill," Article 73, "Legislative Members shall not be held responsible to the outside world for their speeches and votes in the Legislative Yuan," Article 74, "Legislative Members, except for those caught in the act, shall not be arrested or detained without the permission of the Legislative Yuan," Article 75, "Legislative Members shall not hold other public offices or engage in business," Article 76, "The election of Legislative Members and the organization of the Legislative Yuan shall be determined by law." The above articles were all passed according to the original draft. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM and was scheduled to continue the review at 2:30 PM on the afternoon of the 8th. Also, at the end of the meeting on the 5th, Article 62 was finally passed. The text is as follows: "The organization of the Executive Yuan shall be determined by law."

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>New Line of Japanese Diplomacy</h3>
<p>— Shu</p>
<p>Since Japan launched the September 18th Incident, [Foreign Minister Kijūrō] Shidehara's diplomacy has been a complete failure. Subsequent figures have mostly catered to the whims of the military, blindly and ignorantly. The Japanese militarists, on the other hand, fully intended to rely on force, believing that everything could be easily resolved. Unexpectedly, they encountered a formidable opponent, the Soviet Union, on the Asian continent, which made them dare not act rashly. Although they have made every effort to prepare for military action against Russia, they still cannot expect ultimate victory. The Japanese naval faction also always wanted to secure hegemony in the Pacific, even surpassing Britain and the United States. This has aroused the resentment of the United States. Although there are no particularly sinister signs between Japan and the United States on the surface, the fact that large squadrons of American aircraft have flown to Alaska, the Atlantic Fleet has been deployed to the Pacific, and President Roosevelt has made a special trip to Hawaii, are all sufficient to prove that the United States attaches importance to Pacific defense, not just paying lip service, but emphasizing practical matters. At the same time, Britain is also quite displeased with Japan's actions, deeply fearing that the Far East market will be lost and that the control of India will be overthrown. If this continues, Japan will truly fall into suicidal isolation. Furthermore, the Amau Doctrine of April 17th this year fundamentally negated the rational diplomacy advocated by Hirota [Kōki], rendering Hirota's exchange of notes with Hull [Cordell] futile.</p>
<p>The Naval Disarmament Conference is approaching. If Japan fails to use diplomatic skills smoothly, then Britain and the United States are likely to unite, and Japan will inevitably be constrained. Therefore, Hirota is making every effort to promote his rational diplomacy and is implementing a general mobilization of ambassadors stationed in European and American countries, ordering them to return home first to be instructed and to discuss countermeasures (especially to deal with the upcoming disarmament conference), and then to launch separate offensives in their respective countries of residence. Hirota's main plan places the greatest emphasis on winning over Britain, because Britain advocates reducing the tonnage of battleships and increasing light cruisers, which is very close to Japan's position and may be harmonized.</p>
<p>What Britain is most worried about regarding Japan is the fear that the Far East market will be seized by Japan. Therefore, Japan is using the open door policy in the three northeastern provinces [Manchuria] as bait, promising to allow British investment and eagerly welcoming British industrial survey groups to conduct investigations in the Northeast. It has also reversed the blockade policy against Manchuria after the September 18th Incident, turning it into a policy of consensualism. Japan first put forward the slogan of promoting commercial relations to touch the hearts of the four industrialists in the British industrial survey group, making them all sympathetic to Japan's intentions. The matters that are expected to be promoted probably include four types:</p>
<p>(1) Anglo-Japanese cooperation to develop "Manchurian" resources, and the possibility of Britain developing trade with "Manchuria."</p>
<p>(2) Promoting British recognition of the "puppet organization."</p>
<p>(3) Establishing the basic framework for a political agreement based on the traditional friendly relations of the Anglo-Japanese alliance era. (Note: This implicitly implies the revival of the Anglo-Japanese alliance.)</p>
<p>(4) Easing and coordinating Anglo-Japanese commercial competition in overseas markets, etc. If these can be developed gradually, then the "Anglo-Japanese Cotton Industry Conference" previously held in London may continue in the future.</p>
<p>The above four items may not be realized immediately, and the British may not be willing to accept them. The industrial survey group is not a responsible diplomatic organization either. The Japanese authorities are well aware of this. The reason for their tireless efforts is simply to first seek the understanding of the British business community, so that Anglo-Japanese relations will no longer deteriorate and will gradually improve. Japan can then take advantage of this period to further plan to realize its political plans towards China. It also knows that the United States, for the sake of developing the Far East market, will never allow Japan to monopolize it. If it insists on acting tough and relies solely on military force without using diplomacy, it will eventually suffer. Japan once vigorously advocated a war with the United States, but now it has completely reversed its old stance, striving to ease emotional tensions between Japan and the United States and avoid conflicts in language and writing. The goal is the same. However, Japan never relaxes its preparations in terms of strength. It also expects that the demand for equality in naval armament will be implemented.</p>
<p>Japan's recent diplomatic policy claims to be aggressive because it has a strong navy as its background, and it intends to develop economic markets. The claim of "equality in armament ratios" certainly contains political effects. On the surface, it wants to use the recognition of puppet states by various countries as an exchange condition, but in reality, it attempts to use the name of coordination and harmony to increase its economic benefits. When necessary, it will cooperate with Britain to share the Far East market, so that the United States has no way to develop, and it can reap greater benefits. This is the new arrangement of its diplomatic activities.</p>
<h3>Japan's Careful Plan to Express Goodwill to Russia and Russia's Western Neighbors to Maintain Neutrality in Case of Emergency</h3>
<p>(Paris) This "Daily News" here reports that although Japan has suffered setbacks, it is still vigorously implementing its policy of encircling the Soviet Union, attempting to make the Soviet Union's neighbors maintain neutrality. The report draws attention to the fact that a Japanese military delegation has arrived in Poland, and states that Polish industry has accepted orders for military supplies from the Japanese side. The report specifically points out Finland, stating that a Japanese economic survey group led by Japanese business tycoon Akagawa visited the Finnish capital a month ago. (TASS dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Russian Ambassador Meets with Hirota to Continue Discussing the Chinese Eastern Railway Issue</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Soviet Russian Ambassador Yurenev visited Foreign Minister Hirota at 5:30 p.m. on the afternoon of the 5th and left after a two-hour consultation. Regarding the content of the meeting, the Foreign Minister explained the "Manchukuo's" opinions on the conditions proposed by the Soviet Union, namely, the conditions proposed by the Russian side were: (1) Cash payment in three years, with interest payable in the second and third years, and the Japanese government guarantees this matter; (2) Goods to be delivered in two years, guaranteed by the Japanese government, with no restrictions on the types of goods; (3) The date of the first payment is recognized as the actual date of transfer; (4) Russian railway personnel must give three months' notice before leaving their posts, etc. Regarding the opinions of "Manchukuo," although there were different opinions on items 1 and 2, the Japanese government guaranteed the payment and an appropriate method of payment could be found. For item 3, the Russian side considered the payment date as the transfer date, but "Manchukuo" considered the signing date as the time of receiving the railway. Item 4 was the most important issue to pay attention to in continuing operations. The Russian side intended to recall its railway personnel immediately after signing and receiving payment, but the Manchukuo side was concerned that operations would not be smooth and requested an appropriate solution. He again met with the Russian ambassador that day and reserved his reply on matters related to items 2 and 3. (Jiji dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Japan Plans to Establish a Commerce Conference with Britain; British Officials Say They Have Not Heard of This</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs plans to take advantage of the visit to Japan by the British industrial group to establish a permanent Anglo-Japanese Commerce Conference. It plans to draft concrete methods before the group returns home after inspecting "Manchukuo." Currently, Director of the Commerce Bureau Kurasu is in contact with Takashima, the person in charge of the Economic Federation, to draft the proposal. Sir Babbage and others also hope to establish a commerce conference in Tokyo and London, with an equal number of representatives from the Economic Federation of Japan and the Federation of British Industries selected as intermediaries. (Dentsu dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(London) A Tokyo dispatch reports that Japanese industrialists, due to the dispatch of an investigation team to Manchuria by the Federation of British Industries, intend to organize an Anglo-Japanese committee to coordinate the commercial relations between the two countries. British officials, upon hearing this news, declared that they had never heard of such a plan, but stated that the British investigation team was dispatched by the Federation of British Industries, and as for commercial negotiations, they were mostly initiated by the government, and there could be no relationship between the two. However, this does not mean that representatives of the British industrial investigation team and Japanese industrialists cannot hold talks. It is still feasible for them to inquire about news from each other in an informal manner. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Naval Discussions Mainly Involve Politics, Expressing Traditional Friendship with China; Japan's Views Conflict</h3>
<p>(London) Today, news from Washington states that there are widespread rumors that the United States is now strongly advocating that the naval conference should also address political issues. This is supposedly due to the reaction of Chinese public opinion caused by the U.S. silver policy, and the desire to make up for the shortcomings. The U.S. silver policy will not change, so Washington is willing to express its traditional friendship with China and has not weakened it. At the same time, Japan firmly opposes the naval conference involving politics, saying that the debates in Geneva before the Manchurian Incident have proven the ineffectiveness of conference diplomacy. The overall situation in the Far East has now clearly defined the scope, and there is nothing to discuss. The American diplomatic community here, before the arrival of the U.S. representative Davis in England, is not aware of the intentions of the U.S. government. As for the attitude of China, although it can be guessed, it has not been formally announced. All those friendly to China say that the naval conference is a good opportunity to dispel suspicions in the Far East. On the contrary, if political issues are excluded from the discussion, it will have a very bad impact on Chinese public opinion, as the 1922 conference did include political issues as an entire section. (China Press special dispatch, October 5th)</p>
<p>(London) The U.S. President's appointment of Secretary of War Stanley as an advisor to the naval preparatory conference has suddenly attracted the attention of the British press. Today's "Times" specifically published a Washington telegram stating that the U.S. government's intention in appointing Stanley as an advisor is to allow advocates of a large navy to have a chance to speak. The U.S. government's determination to vigorously maintain the current ratio system and oppose the abolition of aircraft carriers and bombers is clear and quite strong. Other newspapers also discussed the U.S. government's strong advocacy of maintaining the current ratio and its attitude against aircraft carriers, and anticipated discussions on political issues. Before the preparatory conference opened, the conflict between Japanese and American opinions was significant, and the hope for the success of the conference was very small. (Jiji dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to reliable sources, the Navy believes that there is no possibility of compromise in the preliminary disarmament talks in October and the formal disarmament conference next year. Navy Minister Osumi is preparing to have Foreign Minister Hirota instruct Chief Representative Ambassador Matsudaira to announce the abandonment of the Washington Treaty in late October or early November. On the other hand, elder statesman Saionji, Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Makino, and Grand Chamberlain Yuasa and other senior officials also foresee that the Navy's reckless actions cannot be restrained and are actively preparing for the second phase of peace work, which is to ease the wartime attitude of the Army and Navy from the sidelines. The aim is to propose to Britain and the United States the conclusion of another peace treaty at the same time as announcing the abandonment of the treaty. Besides conveying Hirota's opinions, former ambassador to Europe and the United States Yoshida Shigeru has the important mission of proposing a new treaty to Britain and the United States. Yoshida Shigeru is the son-in-law of Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Makino. The elder statesmen also separately instructed Ambassador Matsui to lobby the British government. Within Japan, former Foreign Minister Baron Shidehara is contacting financial groups and other non-interventionist forces to avoid the crisis of war. (Hualian dispatch, 6th)</p>

<h3>Resolution of the British Conservative Party Conference to Uphold the Government's Traditional Platform and Advocate the Issuance of National Lottery Tickets</h3>
<p>(London) Today was the second and final day of the Conservative Party conference in Brighton. The conference passed several resolutions of great interest. The first resolution expressed the Conservative Party's clear support for the current government and stated that the party should emphasize its support for the current cabinet in its national propaganda. However, in the evening, delegates made a special statement: "The Conservative Party has its traditional platform, which it will maintain even under the National Government." Therefore, the so-called support for the current government does not imply complete theoretical agreement. The second resolution stated that the creation of individual freedom in the economy has always been the party's position. Although some delegates pointed out the dangers of state intervention in private enterprise, the party believes that individual enterprise should not be excessively free in the economy.

<h3>British Undersecretary of War Announces Poison Gas Defense Strategy</h3>
<p>(London) Undersecretary of War Sir Kredge published a booklet yesterday entitled "Strategies for Defense Against Gas."

This booklet is currently a textbook for training units. It is also planned to publish a book on combat affairs and a book on gas defense in the future. Sir Kredge's booklet sufficiently indicates that the British military has little confidence in whether belligerent nations will abide by the Geneva Protocol on gas warfare. Mr. Kredge stated, "In the event of war, some belligerent nations may not have signed the Geneva Protocol, while others, though having signed it, may violate it." However, the author also stated that while chemical warfare may have tactical advantages, it may also cause a backlash in neutral countries. No country would rashly embark on this without first weighing the advantages and disadvantages. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>

The rebound in grain prices. Both of these things made people feel enthusiastic. The exchange's unfulfilled obligations on September 29 were 869,000 shares, an increase of 42,000 shares compared to August 31. This small increase and the decrease in brokers' loans show that the stock market is more solid than generally expected, and the unfavorable factor is that the public is still unaware of participating in stock trading. When the stock market opened today, the market situation was calm and stable, and various securities mostly rose slightly. Yesterday's rise is expected to unfold slightly, but people in the industry still want to wait and see, and there is a trend of not wanting to rush to follow when prices rise.

<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Arrives in Hankou by Warship from Xunyang</h3>
<p>Inspects Bandit Suppression in Border Areas and Gives Instructions on Disaster Relief</p>
<p>Liu Zhi and Others Gather in Hankou, Wang Kong Also Said to Come to Hankou</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, in order to inspect the progress of bandit suppression in the border areas of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces and give instructions to the generals, set off from Guling at 10:00 AM on the 4th, accompanied by his wife, Madame Soong Mei-ling, and entourage. He arrived in Xunyang at 2:00 PM in the afternoon and boarded the Yong Sui warship to go west, escorted by the Minsheng warship. The ships traveled for 18 hours and arrived in Hankou at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 5th. The entourage included Chief of Staff Xuan Tiewu, Director of the Quartermaster Department Zhou Junyan, Director of the Management Department Xiong Zhongtao, Director of the First Department Yan Daogang, Legislator Xiao Xuan, Chief Secretary of the Headquarters Mao Qingxiang, Secretary Liang Yingwen, Section Chief Chen Defa, Section Chief Dai Li, Councilor Wei Xijiong, Staff Officer Duan Luming, Lu Jizhai, and others, as well as 100 guards, who arrived earlier on the Jiangtian Lun. Upon hearing the news of Chiang's arrival in Hankou, the military and political authorities of Wuhan immediately set up a headquarters in the Central Bank. Entourage members were designated to be stationed in the Bankers' Association and the former Russian Consulate. Important military leaders, in addition to Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang and Commander-in-Chief of Pacification in Hubei Province He Chengjun, who were originally stationed in Wuhan, and those who came to Hankou one after another to pay their respects, included Director of Pacification in Henan Province Liu Zhi, Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the Hubei-Hunan Border Region Xu Yuanquan, Commander of the 11th Route Army Liu Maoen, Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Pursuit in the Border Region Shangguan Yunxiang, Commander of the 9th Army Hao Mengling, Commander of the 57th Army He Zhuguo, Commander of the 67th Army Wang Yizhe, and Chief of Staff of the Western Headquarters of the Five Provinces Guo Chiping and others. When Chiang arrived in Hankou, they were all at the wharf to welcome him. Garrison Commander Ye Peng and Police Chief Chen Xizeng commanded the military police to provide strict security. Chiang and his wife left the ship to the sound of gun salutes and went straight to the headquarters for a short rest. He then received Zhang Xueliang, He Chengjun, Liu Zhi, Zhang Qun, Xu Yuanquan, Qian Dajun, Liu Maoen, Shangguan Yunxiang, Ye Peng, Hao Mengling, He Zhuguo, Wang Yizhe, Dong Yingbin, Guo Chiping, Li Jihong, and others, and briefly inquired about military and political affairs. At 6:00 PM, he toured the city of Hankou by car. That evening, he invited Zhang Xueliang and others to a casual dinner at the headquarters. It was decided that he would cross the river on the morning of the 6th to inspect the headquarters. In the next few days, he will convene chairmen, members, and department heads of the provincial government to inquire about the situation of administration and give instructions on disaster relief methods. Whether he will personally go to the border area for inspection is still uncertain. Yang Yongtai, Secretary-General of the Nanchang Headquarters, and Xia Douyin, Chief Consultant, have set off for Hankou to assist in official duties. Wang President of the Executive Yuan and Kong Xiangxi, Minister of Finance, are also said to be coming to Hankou to meet him. In addition, military officers who continue to come to Hankou include Liang Guanying, Commander of the 25th Route Army, and several others. After paying their respects to Chiang, they returned to their posts. A reporter visited Mr. He Chengjun and asked about the mission of Chiang's trip. He said that Chairman Chiang's trip west was to inspect the progress of bandit suppression in Wuhan and the border areas of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces, and to inspect the disaster situation so as to plan relief. He probably wouldn't stay long and would return to Jiangxi to supervise the suppression. According to Liu Zhi, there are no bandits in Henan Province. In the area bordering Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, there are still scattered bandits hiding and causing trouble. A large army is searching for them, and it is expected that they will be cleared soon. The focus of the aftermath work is on construction. More than 5,000 li of highways have been completed in Henan Province, and half of them are still to be built. This not only facilitates transportation, but also provides considerable relief to the people. The breach of the Yellow River is being urgently blocked, and the embankments are being raised and thickened by the counties. The government has raised 1.5 million yuan for construction to subsidize the project, so that officials and the people can cooperate to complete this important project and avoid future troubles. This year's agricultural harvest is averaging 80%. The provincial government will implement joint offices on September 1, reducing expenses by one-quarter. He came to investigate the joint office situation in Hubei Province as a reference. Those who came to Hankou with Liu included Liu Suizhen, Director of the Henan Provincial Government Gazette Office, Hu Minglong, representative of the Civil Affairs Department, Kong Xianzhang, representative of the Finance Department, Wang Chunyuan, supervisor of the Education Department, Hu Jianfen, technician of the Construction Department, and representatives of the Security Department and the High Court, a total of 10 people.

<h3>Chairman Chiang Orders General Attack by Sichuan Army</h3>
<p>Liu Xiang Telegraphed Hankou that Several Positions Have Been Captured Consecutively</p>
<p>Sichuan Representatives Arrive in Hankou to Visit Chiang and Report on Sichuan Affairs</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Sichuan army's bandit suppression slightly stalled after Liu Xiang offered his resignation. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek paid extraordinary attention to the province's bandit suppression affairs, repeatedly telegraphing Liu Xiang to resume his post, and dismissed and investigated Luo Zezhou, the division commander who falsely reported military intelligence and fled at the sight of the bandits. Military discipline was rectified. Although Liu Xiang has not yet resumed his post, he has not relaxed slightly in military deployment and once went to the front to deploy, and morale was revived. It is heard that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek recently telegraphed the Sichuan army to launch a general attack to avoid the bandit forces from growing larger and to clear them as soon as possible. On the same day, Liu Xiang happened to telegraph Hankou with a report of victory, which read, "According to the telegram from [missing characters] brigade Jiang Xu, my [missing characters] regiment Dong Ri captured Changlingzhai, Jiang Wu captured Laojunshan and Fenghuangzhai, [missing characters] division [missing characters] brigade, Yan Mao captured Shiqiaohe and Zhuanjinzai, Yan Wu captured Lanzhai and Wumiaoshan, Dong Yin captured Qijiashan, Wangjianzai, and Longxiang Temple, etc. The regiment [missing characters] has cleared bandits from Jianglingxi and Mengshuihe, and the other side of my shore. A part of the bandits retreated to the Ba River, and a part crossed the Mengshui River, all in extreme embarrassment. There are no traces of bandits below the river and Jianglingxi. Currently, they are still advancing in separate ways." Because the bandits of Xu were rampant, the people of Sichuan Province repeatedly sent representatives out of Sichuan to request the central government and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to send a large army to suppress them in order to save the people of Sichuan. In addition to the representatives of all circles, Long Wenzhi and Huang Yinggan, who have already passed through Hankou to Beijing, Hu Wenlan, Luo Chunshi, Zhou Fengchi, Wenhua Cheng, Li Kui'an, Wen Shaohe, and other six representatives of the Sichuan People's Bandit Suppression Support Association, have just arrived in Nanchang and heard that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek had set off for Hankou, so they also rushed west. They arrived on the afternoon of the 5th and planned to visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in the coming days to report on Sichuan affairs and request the dispatch of personnel to jointly suppress and clear the remaining bandits as soon as possible to save the people of Sichuan.

<h3>Three-Route Army Breaks Through the Stone City Defense Line of the Jiangxi Bandits</h3>
<p>The Pseudo-Third Army Corps Retreats in Embarrassment</p>
<p>The National Army is Only Forty Miles from the City</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The Red Bandits regarded Stone City as the hub connecting southern Jiangxi and western Fujian, and as the shield for Ruijin and Tingzhou. Therefore, the pseudo-Third Army Corps, Peng Dehuai's four or five divisions, etc., relied on the dangerous terrain at the junction of southern Guangchang and northern Stone City to defend it to the death. The Three-Route Army, as the main force in attacking the bandit lairs, advanced south from Guangchang and successively broke through the first and second lines of defense they had set up, approaching Stone City County. The war process was reported in great detail by the Three-Route Headquarters, and the text is recorded as follows: "The Third Route Army of the Northern Route Bandit Suppression Army, since the end of last month, after destroying the solid positions of the bandit area north of Yiqian, Peng Bandit Dehuai took advantage of our building blockhouses and roads to reconstruct his so-called improved several lines of defense between Yiqian and Stone City, with fortresses crisscrossing more than 20 li, which were exceptionally solid, declaring that he would swear to defend them to the death and coexist with the positions. After the Three-Route Army completed the blockhouse road, it began to attack the bandit positions on Youchen. Although the bandits resisted stubbornly relying on the dangerous terrain, they were eventually forced to retreat by the brave advance of officers and soldiers of each division, accurate artillery fire, and effective aerial reconnaissance and bombing, capturing more than 40 bandit blockhouses in a row and occupying the high ground of Zhongzizhai, Zhonghuashan, and Chenguling. The first line of solid defense of the bandits was completely destroyed by us, and they retreated to the second line of solid defense of Dapa岭, Luojiafeng, and Fenshuicao, and tried even more desperately to struggle. At dawn on the day of Gan, our side continued to attack with the Huo Tang, Sun, and Zhou divisions, and the bandits still resisted stubbornly relying on the dangerous terrain, and launched continuous assaults on us, which were quite fierce. Finally, thanks to the efforts of our officers, soldiers, and air artillery troops, the second line of solid defense was completely occupied before Shenshi, and the bandits fled to their third line and Stone City in confusion, extremely embarrassed. At dawn on the day of Jian, our army, with the [missing characters] division and a part of the [missing characters] and [missing characters] divisions, took advantage of the victory to pursue and occupied the third line of solid defense of the bandits near Tonggang. Now our army is only 40 li away from Stone City, and it will not be difficult to take it down in one fell swoop after the blockhouse road is completed. In this campaign, more than 10 light and heavy machine guns and more than 500 rifles were captured from the bandits, and even more bandits were captured. During the fierce battle on the day of Gan, Zhang Yi, the division commander of the pseudo-Third Army Corps' Fourth Division, surrendered to our Zhou Sixth Division during the retreat of the division. According to his confession, he was from Funing, Jiangsu, a graduate of the 21st term of the Japanese military academy. He originally served as a regiment commander under Li Bandit Mingrui, and later served as the chief of staff of Peng Dehuai's bandit troops. Not long ago, because Hong Chao, the division commander of the Fourth Division, was reassigned as the chief of staff of the Eighth Army Corps, he was transferred to fill the vacancy. On the days of You and Gan, the bandits who fought on our front were the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Fifteenth Divisions and three independent regiments, with a large number of casualties. The pseudo-Fourth Division alone suffered more than 2,500 casualties in the battles of Guanqiao and Yiqian." (3rd)</p>
<h3>Communist Activities Underway in Tangdong Mining Areas</h3>
<p>Traitors Use Workers to Plot Wrongdoing</p>
<p>Inspection of Mining Areas Has Begun to Prevent This</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Recently, traitors have appeared in Tangdong, dispatching their cronies to carry out activities, inciting the miners of Kailuan to plot a riot. Tangshan, Luan County, Changli, and Xugezhuang, Guye, Zhaogezhuang, Majiagou, and other places are all in a state of unrest. Especially in the four eastern mining areas of Kailuan, Majiagou, Zhaogezhuang, Guye, and Xugezhuang, order is becoming more and more chaotic, and people are increasingly uneasy. According to the investigation of the mining area security team, there are communist elements lurking in each mining area, inciting workers to lean to the left, and there are traitors inciting workers to riot. Workers lack knowledge, and many are being anesthetized by them. Communist leaflets are found from time to time in Dongsi Mine. Although the mining area security team has arrested several suspects and sent them to the Tangshan Public Security Bureau for punishment, it cannot warn the rest. Zhao Xun, the director of the Tangshan Public Security Bureau, concerned about local security, went to Pingjin a dozen days ago to visit Chairman Yu Xuezhong of Hebei Province and Acting Chairman He of the military branch to ask for instructions on prevention. At the end of last month, he returned to Tangshan and went to each mining area for a week of inspection, and secretly ordered the security team of each mine to quickly deploy to prevent problems before they happen. At the same time, he conferred with Zhao Lei, the commander of the Second General Team of the war zone security, and agreed that Zhao would send two squads to Guye, where order was the most chaotic, to assist the security team in setting up defenses and maintaining order. Other mines, starting from the 2nd of this month, were divided into defense zones by the Luan security team, digging trenches at the intersections of the mining areas and piling up sandbags in the streets. The security team was on guard day and night in shifts. Strangers were prohibited from entering the mining areas after 6:00 PM. Even workers entering and leaving had to hand in their copper badges for verification. As a result, people felt a little uneasy. Shops in each mining area have shortened their business hours in particular to prevent accidents. However, even with such precautions by the security team, bandits can still be found hiding among them. At 6:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd, when the miners of Majiagou Mine were leaving work, a miner named Li Decai was blocked by six men as soon as he left the gate of the mining area. They pretended that Li owed them money and forced Li away with a pistol. By the time other workers realized that Li had been taken away by bandits and reported to the mine director to chase after them, it was already too late. Under such an uneasy state, miners who have families have moved elsewhere. Although Luan County is not as tense as the Tangshan area, it is reported that Zhao Dazhong's followers have already infiltrated and plan to take action on the upcoming National Day. Liu Zuozhou, the commander of the First General Team of the war zone security stationed there, in addition to ordering his troops to strictly defend, went to Tangshan on the 2nd of this month to discuss prevention measures with Tao Shangming. He also feared that if an incident occurred, it would inevitably involve diplomacy, so Tao must explain to a certain country in advance to avoid unexpected problems. After asking for instructions, Liu returned to Luan County on the afternoon of the 3rd to step up defenses. (4th)</p>
<h3>Xu Prefecture Rivers Urgently Need Dredging</h3>
<p>Third Army Advocates Building by Soldiers and Workers</p>
<p>County Government Asks Construction Department to Send Personnel for Guidance</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: In the Xu Prefecture area, heavy rains at the end of last month caused disasters everywhere. During the heavy rains in Xubu, the rivers overflowed and water accumulated, causing houses along the river to be washed away. After the weather cleared, the water began to return to the canals, but the miserable state of the disaster victims, eating in the wind and sleeping in the open, was already unbearable to witness. Zeng Wanzhong, the Xuzhou Garrison Commander, Wang Debo, the Inspector Commissioner, and Wang Gongyu, the County Magistrate, set off together the day before yesterday to inspect along the river. They believed that it was necessary to thoroughly dredge the Tongjing and other main rivers, and that it was especially urgent to repair the city embankment. Regarding the larger rivers, the Jingshan River in northern Xu, which receives water from Weishan Lake and empties into the Central Canal, the county government has already planned to dredge it in sections. The silted Yellow River around the city and the Kui River south of the city are two major main rivers. Although dredging is planned, the project is very large and relies on provincial funds. Regarding the repair of the city embankment, Wang Jun, the commander of the Third Army, and Zeng Wanzhong have advocated construction by soldiers and workers, but the material costs are also considerable and need to be thoroughly planned. County Magistrate Wang Gongyu Xu has already telegraphed the province to report the disaster and on the 4th, he specifically telegraphed the Construction Department based on the inspection situation, requesting that personnel be sent to survey the Yellow and Kui Rivers and dredge them thoroughly. The text read, "I respectfully report that in this county, in the late evening of last month, torrential rain poured down and did not stop all night. The city and countryside were a vast expanse of water, turning into a country of lakes, and the disaster situation has already been reported to the province on the River Day. I respectfully investigate the reasons for this disaster. Although it is said that there was an excessive amount of rainfall, and the river water level suddenly increased to three meters, which was an extraordinary event, the main reason is that there are too few rivers in this county, and the main rivers in the county have been silted up for many years, forming flat ground, making it difficult for rainwater to be contained and discharged, resulting in flooding. Regarding the dredging of rivers in this county in the 22nd year, in addition to the Guanggou River in the seventh district and other small rivers in the rural villages in other districts and villages, the farmers on both sides have a stake in the matter and have automatically applied for the conscription of workers to dredge them, and they have all been completed. However, the remaining rivers, such as the Yan River, Jingshan River, Bulao River, North-South Fang, Ning River, etc., all have deep accumulated water, and this county has no water pumping equipment, making it impossible to carry out construction. A report has been made, and all the rivers that have not been dredged previously will be dredged thoroughly and practically this winter in accordance with the dredging regulations promulgated. However, it is found that the Kui River in the first and seventh districts and the Yellow River in the first, fourth, fifth, sixth, and eighth districts are all major rivers in this county, and the siltation is even worse. If they are not excavated at the same time, it will still not benefit the water conservancy of the entire county. Now, because the project is heavy and requires a large amount of funds, I dare not plan it rashly. I would like to request that your department allow the dispatch of personnel for guidance in order to dredge and eliminate future troubles. Is there anything appropriate? I only ask for instructions to be obeyed." The water conservancy of Xubu has been neglected for a long time, and the people have become frightened birds due to the floods year after year. Dredging rivers and repairing embankments has become the unanimous call of the people of Xu. However, the project is grand and difficult to accomplish year after year. If the military and government cooperate, it may be easier to achieve results.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou's Massive Robbery Case</h3>
<p>Bandits Use Bombs as Cover for Robbery</p>
<p>Da Sun Company Robbed of Diamonds and Gold Jewelry</p>
<p>Bombs Injure Five Customers in Store</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: In recent years, rural economies in Guangdong Province have collapsed, commerce has declined, and the entire society is in a state of depression. The number of unemployed people has surged, leading to frequent cases of fraud and robbery. Over the past months, there have been several instances of bandits robbing people on the streets in the city. Unexpectedly, at the end of this month (September), a shocking massive robbery occurred in the most prosperous area of the city, heavily guarded by soldiers and police. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Da Sun Department Store, located on Hui'ai Middle Road in front of the Finance Bureau, has a thriving business and attracts a large number of customers day and night. The gold, silver, and jewelry department of the company is conveniently located downstairs in the most conspicuous area, which led to the bandits' early scheming. At 7:45 PM on the 28th of the month, when the store was crowded with customers, two men resembling civil servants, dressed in white suits and carrying briefcases, appeared. Acting generously, they approached the jewelry department to order expensive ornaments. The store staff, thinking they were dealing with wealthy customers, prepared soda and cigarettes for them. The men first selected a diamond bracelet, the most valuable item, and examined it carefully. Unsatisfied, they requested two more diamond rings to assess their quality. At the same time, one of the men took out a stack of foreign currency to convince the staff of their credibility. The staff, therefore, did not suspect anything and repeatedly emphasized the value of each item, hoping to close the deal. The two men passed the items to each other for inspection. After a while, they announced that they would purchase all of them. Unexpectedly, just as the price was being calculated, a large man nearby suddenly raised his hand towards the bottom of the staircase, and a loud explosion occurred, like a thunderclap. The entire store was thrown into chaos. Several injured people fell to the ground, screaming loudly. Amidst the commotion, the two men seized the diamond rings and bracelet (worth over 4,000 yuan) and fled. The staff could only shout for thieves but dared not chase them, fearing that leaving their posts would result in the loss of all the gold jewelry. By the time the police arrived, the bandits had already escaped with the stolen goods. Only a few suspects were apprehended outside the store and taken to the police station for interrogation. Upon investigation, it was discovered that the loud explosion was caused by a small bomb, pre-arranged by the bandits to facilitate the robbery. There were five men and women injured by the explosion: Gao Shan, a customer, 40 years old, from Fangcheng, military personnel; Li Huoran, an employee of the company's hardware department; Shao Guang, 30 years old, from Nanhai; an elderly woman, Shi Wu, and her grandson, Pan Zonghong, who was in her arms. They were immediately transported to the Municipal Hospital by ambulance for treatment. Fortunately, Gao, Shao, and Li suffered minor injuries and returned home after receiving treatment. However, the elderly woman, Shi Wu, sustained multiple injuries, with shrapnel penetrating her abdomen and is still hospitalized. Her grandson, Pan Zonghong, is unharmed and has been taken back by his parents. The explosion under the company's staircase left a large hole. A white pith helmet and a black leather company bag were left behind by the bandits, containing only a few old newspapers. The arrested suspects have been released after interrogation. It is reported that the Chief of the Provincial Public Security Bureau believes that the bandits' blatant bombing and robbery in an area heavily guarded by soldiers and police is unacceptable. He has ordered his subordinates to apprehend the fugitives and has offered a reward of 2,000 yuan for a swift resolution of the case. (September 29th)</p>
<h3>Northwest Inspection Report</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Geng Ya</p>
<p>An Overview of the Life of the Qinghai Tibetan People (Part 2)</p>
<p>The marriage system of the Tibetan people is purely based on free love. Although there are cases where marriages are arranged by parents or through matchmakers, or determined by divination, it is difficult to force a marriage without the mutual affection and consent of the parties involved. Furthermore, there are absolutely no such marriage proposals beforehand. Young Tibetan men and women, at the age of thirteen or fourteen, are gradually tempted by their surroundings to begin their pursuit of love. It is rare to find a virgin girl or an untouched boy. However, parents do not consider this a loss, and society does not find it strange. At the beginning of marriage negotiations, the man's family first sends gifts, such as cattle, sheep, horses, hada scarves, and felt blankets. If the woman's family accepts them happily, they can prepare for the wedding. However, they may also return the gifts to indicate that she is already betrothed to someone else. At the wedding, the man's family must invite a lama to choose an auspicious day, hang Buddhist images, set up a small table in front, and place ghee cakes and various foods on it. Leather cushions are laid out on both sides for seating, and a white felt cloth is specially laid out with a swastika pattern made of wheat in the center for the bride to sit on when she arrives. However, this type of ceremony is often not used.</p>
<p>The woman's family receives the wedding gifts from the man's family (i.e., cattle, horses, tea, cloth, etc., the abundance depending on the family's wealth), and then employs four or five male and female relatives and friends, each riding a good horse, to escort the bride. The bride's clothes, hat, and boots are all made of leather. She covers her face with a handkerchief and sings songs in a melodious and clear voice. The songs are learned from a young age, and a special old woman is hired to teach them before the wedding, showing how much importance is placed on this. The entire tribe of the man's family, old and young, wears fine clothes and waits on the roadside, vying to see the bride's arrival. Even if they are whipped by the man's welcoming guests, they do not mind. In some places, when the bride enters the gate, the welcomers hide behind the gate and shout loudly when the bride is unaware, then scatter a handful of grains, saying that it can drive away ghosts and demons. However, the bride who is timid will be scared out of her wits. Later, there are those who worship the family gods and parents-in-law, and there are those who do not. However, the groom sometimes hides in a secret place and does not see guests, which is quite strange. The woman's family sends hada scarves and a few simple dowry items during the feast, and praises the woman's family's high status, as if they did not deign to marry, but because of fate, they had no choice, hoping that the groom would encourage and cherish himself. Then the man's family's relatives and friends reply, neither giving in, and after getting drunk, they often argue to the point of drawing their knives, but they are bound by customs and are only showing each other temporary intimidation. The next day, the man's family's relatives and friends take turns entertaining the bride, and the bride soon returns to her parents' home. After a few days, they choose another auspicious day to welcome her again, and the wedding ceremony is completed. However, the above wedding ceremony seems to be mostly performed by the familiar Tibetans of neighboring provinces and counties, and cannot be regarded as the most common wedding ceremony. The common wedding ceremony of the Tibetan people does not have a specific ceremony. Every time there is a welcoming ceremony for gods, celebrations, songs, and dances, men and women gather and admire each other, and that is the act of engagement and biting the arm. Although the parents' consent is obtained later, they only say yes, and there is no buying and selling system, nor is there any exchange of gifts. The wedding is held, and relatives and friends only enjoy a few bowls of cold wine. There is no food to accompany the wine, and they must drink it themselves. When the excitement is high and the wine is strong, they sing and have fun. First, they choose the most beautiful and healthy woman, sing a melancholic song, and hold a wine bowl. When she sees her beloved (man), she holds the wine with her right hand and wraps her left hand around his head and pours the wine down his throat. If she is holding a hat in her hand, she puts the hat in his arms. The man gets up and sings in response, looking for another woman to exchange with. First, they sing happy songs and wine songs, then gradually change to lewd and obscene songs. By the time the night is late and deep, they are drunk, and each person is given a piece of half-cooked mutton, and they cut it with a knife, eat, laugh, and return home. The next morning, everyone does their own thing. The bride and groom do not have the trouble of a three-day or full-month feast for relatives and friends. It is both enjoyable and economical, and should not be despised just because it is a Tibetan custom.</p>
<p>If a family has daughters but no sons, they may also adopt a son-in-law. If they are afraid that the adopted son-in-law will be unworthy (such as causing trouble due to murder and robbery, which is the easiest thing for a Tibetan man to do), but for the sake of continuing the family line, they only dress up their daughter, who has reached the age of marriage, in the attire of a married woman, and bow to the sky. They can attract bees and butterflies and get what they want. Sometimes, four or five brothers in a family send two or three of them to the temple to become lamas, and the rest marry one wife together. It is said that this can maintain deep fraternal feelings and avoid the worry of sisters-in-law dividing the family and property, making it difficult to maintain life. The children born call the eldest brother "Great Father," and the rest are called "Second Father" and "Third Father." Women are mostly healthy and strong, and they can still work as usual while giving birth and raising children. When the baby is a month old, after the lama gives it a name, it is placed on the ground with a small lamb, for some unknown reason.</p>
<p>Due to traditional religious and customary relationships, funerals still use cremation, sky burial, water burial, and earth burial ceremonies. The mourning period is about one year, without singing or feasting. Wine may not be abstained from. Because of religious superstition, they believe that being able to die in a sitting position after chanting scriptures and worshiping Buddha during their lifetime is valuable. Otherwise, they use ropes to tie the body into a sitting position, but it is still difficult to sit stably on the ground, then they suspect that they had no good deeds in their lifetime. They move the corpse to the corner of the tent, without offering objects or burning incense. Visitors only offer condolences to the bereaved family, but do not look at the corpse. The most important responsibility of the bereaved family is to ask the lama to chant scriptures and choose a burial site. If no one in the bereaved family is a lama, then even if they give all the family property of the deceased to the lama, the lama will deliberately make things difficult and refuse to comply. Therefore, there are many Tibetans who become lamas, which is a major reason. Coffins are not used for funerals. Only the closest relatives of the deceased take out the corpse, or it can be carried by a camel (Tibetan people are most忌讳 for visitors to tether camels to the tent). The type of burial method to be used is only determined by the lama.</p>
<p>Sky burial, also known as golden burial, involves moving the corpse to a certain high mountain, where vultures eat it until it is completely consumed. Everyone is overjoyed (the Tibetan name for vultures is "Gucha," which is a natural coffin in the Tibetan area and is revered like a god and is not dared to be shot). If the vultures do not eat it, then the family believes that the deceased has committed a sin. They reluctantly use an axe to crush the corpse, or mix it with zanba (wheat food) to lure beasts and dogs. Cremation involves moving the corpse to an open field, using firewood to set fire, placing the corpse in a pot, and adding ghee to burn it. The remaining ashes are buried in a chosen location. When burning, the stinky smoke rises into the air, and everyone fears offending the gods, so there is a saying that cremation is not as good as sky burial. Water burial involves carrying the corpse to the riverbank, cutting it into pieces, and entrusting it to the middle stream for fish to eat. There are two theories about earth burial. One is to bury the corpse in the ground, but everyone believes that this is an inferior burial method, specifically applied to those who die from boils and sores. The intention is not only based on superstition, but also to avoid infection. In addition, the poor have no strength, so they feed the corpse to dogs on the spot, and crush the remaining bones, and then mix it with zanba to feed them, which can also be called earth burial. In summary, although the various burial methods are mostly barbaric and cruel, if reasonable improvements can be made to the cremation method, it can avoid the cruel act of splitting the corpse in sky burial, and there is no worry about the reduction of cultivated land due to earth burial. In a certain sense, it is not impossible to continue using it.</p>

<h3>Extortionist Caught on the Spot</h3>
<p>Wang Baoyuan, a resident of Xita Lane, has some assets and is a student at Fudan School in Shanghai. Yesterday, he suddenly received a threatening letter signed by the Jiangzhe Iron-Blooded Army. The envelope had the words "Confidential, Secretariat of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party" printed at the bottom. The letter demanded 300 yuan in foreign currency to be delivered at the Release Pond between 1:00 PM and 3:00 PM on the 6th. The person delivering the money was required to wear black clothes and hold a newspaper as a signal. If the money was not delivered, they would kidnap him. If he reported it to the military police, the army would arrive and his life would be in danger. After receiving the letter, Wang secretly reported it to the Second Branch Office. Officer Lang immediately sent officers to Wang's residence for protection and reported it to Director He for investigation. He sent Detective Captain Shao Hanzhang, along with detectives Xie Bingchang, to the address. They saw two young men, one in a Western suit and the other in a long gown, acting suspiciously in the rice fields. Officer Lang stepped forward to question them, but they stammered. One was Lu Jiuxian, 21 years old, living in Qingsong Stone, currently a high school student at the Shanghai Business College. A fake pistol was found on him. The other was Yu Yaozhang, 21 years old, living in Caibi Bridge, who had lost his job at the Nantong National Goods Market and returned to Songjiang. Captain Shao sent them to the station for preliminary interrogation. Lu was the nephew of Wang Baoyuan's mother. Upon handwriting verification, Yu Yaozhang's handwriting was similar to that of the threatening letter. Both denied the extortion, making excuses. The downfall of these young men is lamentable.</p>
<h3>Reckless Driving Injures Pregnant Woman</h3>
<p>Zeng, the wife of former Public Security Bureau Inspector Chen Shuliang, returned to Songjiang from her mother's house in Yexie yesterday by boat. She landed at Jinsha Beach and hired a rickshaw. While passing in front of the Xin Songkou Society, she was hit by a car numbered 1380. Zeng was thrown onto the road and suffered abrasions to her eyes and right knee. The rickshaw driver, Wang Xueru, was also injured. The car driver, Pan Xuehai, was detained and taken to the bureau. It was learned that the car had been hired by an organization to deliver clothes to the railway station and the accident was unintentional. The injured Zeng was pregnant and was immediately sent to Mingse Hospital for treatment. It is reported that Zeng suffered nerve damage, but the fetus is unharmed. The Public Security Bureau has sent the case to the court for review.</p>

<h3>Three Generations of Grandfather, Father and Son Kidnapped</h3>
<p>Ni Mubao, a farmer in Shangwei Village, Guangfu Township, Suzhou, is a man of modest means. Five bandits came three days ago and kidnapped Mubao and his son, Nannan, taking them to a boat in Taihu Lake. The family did not receive a ransom letter. At 1:00 AM on the morning of the 5th, nine more bandits came, fired two shots into the house, and kidnapped Ni Mubao's grandson, Xiao Laohu, and stole a suitcase. The kidnapping of three generations of the Ni family in the township has caused quite a stir as there has been no news of them.</p>

<h3>Bandits Rob and Injure a Man</h3>
<p>Jiang Nailin, a shop assistant at the Yutai Shun Timber Store outside the North Gate Wuqiao (from Nanjing, 32 years old), was returning to Nanjing last (5th) night at around 10:00 PM. He was carrying a small leather bag and a net basket and set off from Wuqiao. Because there were no rickshaws, he walked to the railway station. However, when he was passing near Huigong Bridge, he was suddenly confronted by four thugs armed with sharp blades who blocked his way and robbed him. Jiang resisted slightly and was stabbed seven times by the bandits. Bleeding profusely, he fell to the ground in extreme pain and shouted for help. At that time, more than ten workers from the Lixin Cloth Factory were returning from watching a play at the First Stage and heard the cries for help. They rushed forward to chase the bandits, who had already fled. The Fifth Branch Office of the Public Security Bureau also received a telephone report and immediately dispatched armed police officers to pursue them. However, because it was dark at the time, they could not distinguish the direction and were unable to catch them. They used the telephone to notify the timber store to transport the injured man to the Brothers Hospital for treatment. After examination by Doctor Zhu, it was found that the wound to the left artery was the most serious and life-threatening.</p>
<h3>Implementation of Aerial Survey of Land</h3>
<p>After the Provincial Land Survey Team came to Wuxi to measure the land in the county, there were many obstacles in various places, and the measurement procedures were difficult to carry out. Therefore, it has been delayed for several months and has not yet started. Now, the Provincial Land Bureau has decided to use aerial surveys for the land in Wuxi. It has signed a contract with the Army and Government Department's Land Aerial Survey Team, and it is expected to come to Wuxi to implement the survey within days. It is estimated that 17 aerial photography sessions, 7 supplementary photography and inspections, will require a total of 24 flights. There will be 6 flights per month, which will take 4 months to complete. The total business expenses are estimated to be more than 112,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Head of Opium Rehabilitation Center Detained for Bribery</h3>
<p>Fei Dasheng, the head of the Funing County Opium Rehabilitation Center, was accused in a case. The Provincial Opium Prohibition Committee ordered the county to investigate. The county government sent Secretary Yin of the County Opium Prohibition Committee to investigate secretly. The head of the center bribed Secretary Yin with 400 yuan. Yin submitted the bribe money to the county government and reported the facts. County Magistrate Zhang believed that the open bribery by opium prohibition personnel was clearly a sign of guilt and fear of punishment. He immediately detained the head of the center and interrogated him personally. He confessed to the bribery. He telegraphed the Department of Civil Affairs for instructions. It is reported that the department has ordered that the matter be investigated and dealt with severely according to the law.</p>

<h3>Old Illness Recurs, Accidental Shot Leads to Death</h3>
<p>Zhang Danhua, of 160 West Main Street in the city, has three brothers and one sister, who is married to He Yongnian of Lujia Bridge. She often lives in the city along the Hongqiao River. Danhua graduated from the agricultural science department of the Jiangyin Second-Class Industrial School. He is capable and is now 31 years old. He is also handsome (known as Jiangyin Cheng Yanqiu in Shanghai). In 1925, he worked in the newspaper industry as a reporter for this newspaper and the Shibao. During the Feng-Yan War, he served as a secretary to Fan Zhongxiu in E' province and as a military reporter for the Shibao. He was very active and had close ties with people in Beijing and Shanghai. He later returned home due to an incident. Last year, he suddenly suffered a severe stomach illness and also developed an addiction. In March of this year, he went to the Mental Rehabilitation Society to quit smoking and gradually recovered his health. However, he then became enamored with prostitutes and formed an inextricable bond with the local prostitute Xu Sanmei. His internal injuries recurred, triggering his old illness. It is now the time to collect rent. The day before yesterday (the 1st), he went to Mengjiangtang in Shazhou to set up a rent collection station. Danhua's family is well-off and owns thousands of acres of sand fields, which Danhua collects rent from every year. After arriving in the township, his stomach illness flared up and he was in great pain. In a dream, he turned over and accidentally touched the self-defense pistol next to his pillow, and the bullet hit his brain. He died on the evening of the 4th. Due to inconvenient transportation to the city, the news was delayed. Yesterday (the 5th), a special trip was made to the city to inform his sister to go to the township to take care of everything. This led to rumors in the countryside that it was a suicide, which is not true.</p>

<h3>Flood Victims Begging on the Streets</h3>
<p>Hundreds of flood-stricken farmers from Tongxiang, Haiyan, Haining, and the Fifth District of this county have arrived in Jiaxing in recent days, supporting the old and carrying the young, begging along the streets. They were given copper coins or food and told to leave. However, the number of flood victims arriving yesterday and today suddenly increased to two or three thousand, blocking the streets. It is hoped that philanthropists will distribute relief. Later, some people raised funds to cook porridge and provide meals. The Public Security Bureau sent police to maintain order and persuade them to leave.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Finance Cables to Various Chambers of Commerce Approving Staggered Exchange of New Revenue Stamps</h3>
<p>Old Stamps Can Still be Used Until the End of October. Separate Registration Procedures for Exchanging New Stamps Will Be Established</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, and others, received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: "The telegram has been noted. Revenue stamps are essential for the daily business operations of merchants. According to Articles Four and Five of the Provisional Regulations on Stamp Tax, the principle is that they should be affixed and canceled immediately. If merchants can regularly affix them as required, the stamps they purchased should already be affixed to the vouchers, and stamped or signed to cancel them, so there should be no accumulation. However, in recent years, apart from legitimate merchants who have always paid attention to actual affixation and rarely accumulated stamps, most ordinary merchants often misunderstand the purpose of actual affixation, believing that once they have purchased the stamps, they have fulfilled their tax obligations. Therefore, they do not pay attention to actual affixation on vouchers that should be affixed with stamps, resulting in accumulated stamps that should have been affixed. A look at the inspections carried out at any time in various places, and the documents and booklets seized for violations, often involves hundreds of cases, which is clear evidence. Since these accumulated stamps are tax stamps that should have been affixed but were not, the Ministry cannot allow them to be used in the future when actual affixation is strictly enforced, which would cause intangible losses to the national treasury. To say that revenue stamps are similar in nature to securities or postage stamps and cannot be arbitrarily invalidated is incorrect. Revenue stamps are a type of tax stamp that should be purchased and affixed immediately, and are not securities. Moreover, they are completely different in nature from postage stamps for mailing items, so how can they be compared? Having reviewed the reasons for the accumulation of stamps as stated in the telegrams from various chambers of commerce, most of them point to the poor sales system of the collecting agencies, which has led to this situation. Some say that the branch offices assign sales quotas monthly, while others say that the sales staff coerce purchases as a substitute for fines, resulting in merchants accumulating more and more stamps, making it impossible to use them up. While assigning sales quotas and coercing purchases are indeed violations of regulations, the root cause is that merchants have long been accustomed to bad habits, unwilling to affix stamps and happy to recognize a fixed amount for sales, which has led to this situation. As for coerced purchases as a substitute for fines, it must first be based on evidence of merchants failing to affix stamps before there is coercion to purchase and settle the matter. Moreover, in recent years, it has been reported that whenever there is a change of personnel in charge of collecting agencies in various places, they often want to strictly enforce actual affixation in order to rectify the situation. However, there are often local tyrants and unscrupulous gentry who intervene to demand recognition of a fixed amount for sales in order to pursue their own interests. This accumulated habit is not only due to the poor management of the collecting agencies, but also due to the unwillingness of illegitimate merchants to affix stamps as required, and the obstruction of tax administration by local tyrants and unscrupulous gentry, for which they are also to blame. The Ministry is well aware that if this kind of accumulated malpractice is not eradicated, the future of taxation will not be able to follow the right track, and the suffering of merchants will not be alleviated. Therefore, after repeated consideration, the Ministry has formulated measures to limit the period for using old stamps, in order to thoroughly reform the situation. Legitimate merchants mostly purchase and affix stamps immediately, and even if there is accumulation, it is limited and can be used up as scheduled. Only those merchants who do not affix stamps as required, and the local tyrants and unscrupulous gentry who control sales quotas, have a large number of accumulated stamps that should have been affixed. However, the Ministry does not hesitate to sacrifice tax revenue and has issued an advance notice allowing these accumulated stamps to be used until the end of October, which is not a short period. Moreover, the need to rectify stamp tax affairs was decided at the National Finance Conference in May and should have been implemented in September. However, out of concern that merchants might have stamps left over, the Ministry specifically delayed the announcement until the beginning of September and implemented it from November 1, which is actually a period of five months. Therefore, the Ministry has already provided merchants with considerable convenience in using their accumulated stamps. As for the fact that a large portion of the revenue from stamp tax is allocated to various provinces and cities to offset the reduction of surcharges on land tax and the abolition of miscellaneous taxes, it is also for the purpose of reducing the burden on merchants, as has been clearly announced in the bulletin. This is a matter of vital interest to merchants, demonstrating that the Ministry's consideration for merchants is meticulous. The various chambers of commerce, as models for merchants, should understand the overall situation. If they can understand the purpose of this reform, they should consider the interests of the majority of merchants and not be misled by the local tyrants who control sales quotas, who are only seeking their own interests, instigating trouble, and being deceived, resulting in a failure to observe the facts and rashly initiating disputes. The Ministry should have followed the original plan and not made any concessions. However, in consideration of the economic downturn and the difficult business situation in recent years, and that among the measures being reformed, there may be some legitimate merchants who still have a small number of remaining stamps and may suffer some losses, the Ministry is making an additional concession, allowing merchants in various places who still have old stamps left over by the end of October to exchange them for new stamps in installments according to the registration procedures to be established by the Ministry. The registration and exchange methods will be sent for compliance after they have been established. However, from November 1, these old stamps cannot be affixed, and violators will be severely punished without leniency. As for the bulletin stating that vouchers established after November 1 must be affixed with new revenue stamps, this refers to newly established vouchers. Account books for this year, which were established and used before November 1, will naturally remain valid with the old stamps affixed. Merchants in various places have misunderstood this point, and it is hoped that this will be communicated to them as well. Ministry of Finance." (Seal)</p>
<h3>American Ambassador Johnson Discusses Sino-American Relations</h3>
<p>The Mainland Daily News reports that American Ambassador Johnson arrived in Shanghai with his family on Friday morning from Beijing, and took a train to Nanjing that evening to bid farewell to the authorities. He will return to Shanghai no later than Monday next week. A reporter from the Mainland Daily News visited him, and he said that he felt that this trip back to the United States would add many insights, as the United States has changed a lot since he came to China. Although the United States has been experiencing a commercial downturn in recent years, he does not think that the people in the country will be discouraged by it. As for Sino-American relations, there are no pending cases between the two countries. He believes that the current situation in China is very stable, and there is no possibility of war in the Far East in the near future. He will return at the end of January next year, and everything will be the same as when he left today. The American ambassador also answered questions from the reporter, saying that the United States' policy towards China has not changed. What we are concerned about is selling products in China and buying Chinese products to take back. We will continue to maintain equal commercial opportunities. The reporter also asked for his opinion on the upgrading of the Italian ambassador to China. The American ambassador replied that he had learned about it from the newspapers, but the United States is certainly paying attention to this move and will discuss whether it is appropriate to follow Italy's example.</p>
<h3>Xu Shiying Issues a Declaration for Fundraising for Drought Relief in Various Provinces</h3>
<p>Banquet Held at the Chueh Lin Restaurant Last Night</p>
<p>Appealing to All Sectors for Strong Support</p>
<p>The drought this year is exceptionally severe, affecting eleven provinces, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Henan, Hebei, Shanxi, Gansu, and Guizhou, with 369 counties affected. Telegrams have been sent to the authorities and various charitable organizations requesting relief. Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Relief Committee, cannot bear to ignore this disaster and, after returning to Shanghai from Mount Lu, has repeatedly traveled between Nanjing and Shanghai, consulting with government authorities, various charitable organizations, and prominent figures in this city to discuss relief efforts. Considerable progress has been made, and it is planned to establish a Drought Relief Fundraising Association in Shanghai, with various channels for soliciting donations. The association was originally scheduled to be established yesterday, but due to insufficient preparation, it has been postponed to the 14th of this month. The association will be located in the Renji Hall, and will have five groups: (1) General Affairs, (2) Finance, (3) Fundraising, (4) Review, and (5) Investigation and Distribution. Each group will have three members, and the candidates for director and deputy director of each group are still being mutually nominated. A decision can be made in the next few days. After returning to Shanghai this time, Mr. Xu has been consulting and working on the progress. Therefore, at 6:30 PM yesterday, in his personal capacity, he hosted a banquet at the Chueh Lin Vegetarian Restaurant on Avenue Pétain, inviting Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Chu Minyi, Mayor of Shanghai Wu Tiecheng, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce Yu Zuoting, as well as Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Qu Wenliu, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yiting, Wen Lanting, Shi Liangcai, Lin Kanghou, Guan Jiongzhi, and other prominent figures from all walks of life, totaling more than sixty people. He earnestly requested their strong support so that the disaster victims could receive practical benefits, and also prepared a declaration for distribution, shedding tears and pleading for the disaster victims of the eleven provinces. Rumors that a meeting of initiators was held yesterday are completely unfounded. The text of his fundraising declaration is recorded below:</p>
<p>Since the beginning of summer this year, rainfall has been irregular, and the drought has become severe. According to reports, eleven provinces, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Henan, Hebei, Shanxi, Gansu, and Guizhou, have been affected by the disaster, with 369 counties affected and over 11.3 million mu of farmland damaged. Even the water sources have completely dried up, and there has been no harvest. Cases of entire families committing suicide have been repeatedly reported in the newspapers, and the exchange of children for food is likely to become a reality. I lament the frequent disasters and the desolation of the rural areas. Now, they are suffering another catastrophe. The winter season is approaching, and they have no food or clothing. They are suffering from hunger and cold. How can we, the disaster victims, survive the year? As long as we have a breath left, relief cannot be delayed. Saving the country begins with saving the people, and benefiting others is benefiting oneself. It is hoped that everyone can work together to overcome the disaster and relieve the famine for one year. We hope to see that human determination can overcome nature and that next year will bring a good harvest. The future of the nation truly depends on this. Our association is established at the beginning, and we vow to be sincere and compassionate, and to do our best to be comprehensive and clear. We dare to ask all people of virtue to bravely do what is right, and donate grain, money, and gold generously, spreading benevolence to the fields and ridges, like the application of rain. We compare our virtue to the hills and mountains, and hope we are more than just clouds and rainbows. Shedding tears and speaking, we hope you will understand.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to Implement the Latest System After New Ships Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Both the Business Director and the Chief Clerk Will Be Abolished</p>
<p>The Cargo Handling and Passenger Affairs Will Be Managed Concurrently by the First and Second Mates</p>
<p>The Names of the Middle Cabin Departments Will Be Completely Abolished</p>
<p>Breaking the Traditional Bad Habits of China and Creating a New Era in Decades</p>
<p>The new sea vessel Haiyuan, built by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, will arrive in Shanghai on the 25th of this month, and the Haiheng has also left England for Shanghai. In order to eliminate the traditional bad habits of the Chinese shipping industry for decades, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is pioneering the latest system of not using compradores (i.e., business directors) and not setting up chief clerks. This is a new record in Chinese sea vessels and is worth recording.</p>
<h3>Two New Ships En Route</h3>
<p>The first ship, the Haiyuan, set sail from England on September 14. Huang Zonglun, the marine engineer whom the company sent to England for training, is traveling with the ship to Shanghai. According to a reliable source from the company, it will arrive in Shanghai on the 25th of this month. It is expected to have passed the Suez Canal and will arrive in Singapore. The second ship, the Haiheng, was reported yesterday at noon to have departed from Glasgow, England, this month and is expected to arrive in Shanghai in mid-November.</p>
<h3>Learning to Drive Along the Way</h3>
<p>Ma Jiajun, Teng Shibiao, and Zhang Guoquan, the captains and engineer whom the company sent to England to lead the new ships, reported to Shanghai yesterday by telegram that they had returned to China on the Haiheng. As Ma, Teng, and Zhang need to be transferred to the new sea vessels, they are taking the Haiheng to Shanghai, practicing the operation and use of the new ship's engine along the way. Through this voyage of thousands of miles, they will be well-versed in practice and will be able to understand everything and be able to operate freely in the future.</p>
<h3>Implementing the New System</h3>
<p>The company has held several meetings to fundamentally reform the crew system. In addition to abolishing tea boys and replacing them with service staff, it has also decided to abolish the business director, who is a disguised form of comprador. According to the company's latest system, cargo handling and passenger affairs should be handled by chief clerks, who report expenses as they occur. Now, according to the director's instructions from the chief shipowner, the latest management system of world merchant ships is being tested, and even the chief clerk has been abolished, realizing the complete concentration of authority over the deck and bottom of the ship in the shipowner, to achieve the goal of unifying power.</p>
<h3>Greater Responsibility for the First and Second Mates</h3>
<p>The duties of cargo handling and passenger affairs have been changed to be the responsibility of the first and second mates, with the two sharing responsibilities and managing concurrently. According to Shen Jiyun, the chief shipowner of the company, speaking to reporters, the comprador system in Chinese ships has isolated the first and second mates from the affairs of loading and passengers. Since authority is not consistent, there are many abuses. The affairs of the first and second mates are too idle. It is abnormal for Chinese ships to forcibly subordinate cargo and passengers to the comprador. Now, the four new ships are implementing the new system, which not only eliminates the possibility of shirking responsibility, but also allows the shipowner to have full control over the ship, which is the general practice of world sea vessels. This is a new era in breaking the accumulated habits of decades in China. The abolition of the chief clerk and the implementation of the new system on the four sea vessels have been approved by the company's board of directors.</p>
<h3>Baohua Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>Because the Shipowner Has Not Been Released and There Is No One in Charge</p>
<p>The Baohua, of the Ping An Company, was released by Qidong County and arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, but the shipowner, Wang Yunfa, is still detained and has not been released, and the first mate has not returned. The Ping An Company has suspended sailing yesterday because the ship has no responsible crew. They can only ask the Maritime Administration to negotiate with Qidong County again to release Shipowner Wang.</p>
<h3>The Seventh Batch of Ten Overseas Chinese Expelled from Japan Will Return Home Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Will Send Personnel to Shanghai to Provide Relief</p>
<p>Japanese Woman Changes Her Last Name and Follows Her Husband to China</p>
<p>Our overseas Chinese in Japan have been repeatedly expelled unreasonably by Japan. There have been six batches totaling one hundred people. It is now known that craftsmen in Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, and other places are still being expelled in batches. In addition to the ten people who arrived the day before yesterday, there will be another ten overseas Chinese brought by the Liujia Maru, which will arrive tomorrow. The method of expulsion is to search all the belongings of the overseas Chinese and buy all the tickets, determining the number of people to be sent based on the number of tickets purchased. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission learned of Japan's large-scale expulsion of overseas Chinese and sent Tan Zhonglu to Shanghai yesterday to inquire about the arrival schedule of Japanese ships at the Old Post Office Hotel, report back to Nanjing, and said that after returning to Nanjing, he would seek appropriate relief measures. The overseas Chinese are waiting for the reply from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, so there was no petition yesterday. If there is still no news by the 8th, they will petition the party and government authorities again. Among the overseas Chinese who were expelled, there is also a Japanese woman who is the wife of an overseas Chinese. She is about thirty years old. When the woman took a ship from Japan to China, she was repeatedly prevented by the Japanese police. Because the woman had been with her husband for many years and had children, she tried her best to change her name and nationality at our country's consulate in Japan before she was able to follow her husband to China.</p>

According to the reply from the Nanchang Provisional Headquarters, Qia Zi No. 13928, "The submission has been noted and has been forwarded to the Shanghai Municipal Government for review.

<h3>The Dispute Case of the Greater China Rubber Factory Was Heard Yesterday</h3>
<p>Party and Government Discussed Handling Measures. The Second Special Court Continued to Hear the Case Yesterday</p>
<p>The Ta Kung Pao reports that the party and government organs in this city believe that the labor unrest at the Greater China Rubber Factory is serious and, if not resolved quickly, will affect the future of industry and the livelihood of workers. In order to discuss handling measures, a meeting was held at the Social Affairs Bureau in the central district of the city at 10:00 AM yesterday. Dai Youheng, an officer of the Civil Affairs Section of the Municipal Party Department, Wang Xianqing, the conciliation director of the Third Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, and conciliator Tan Peiyan attended. As a result, it was decided to thoroughly investigate the truth of the incident, convene both parties for questioning at a scheduled time, and then mediate according to law. Before a resolution is reached, both parties should wait quietly for the party and government to review the case and should not create any unexpected complications.</p>
<p>The Court Continued to Hear the Case Yesterday. At 2:00 PM on the 4th, a conflict broke out at the Greater China Rubber Factory on Xujiahui Road in the French Concession when the union sent personnel to the factory to collect union dues, which escalated into a violent scene. Four patrolmen sent by the French Concession Patrol were injured. The patrol immediately dispatched a guard team to suppress the situation and arrested Wang Diansheng, a member of the union's executive committee from Nanjing, who had instigated the violence. He was transferred to the Second Special Court for prosecution. The court held a hearing on the 5th. Before the court opened on the morning of the 5th, workers Zhao Muhai (also known as Maotou, 24 years old, from Nanjing, residing at No. 2 Wuzhou Lane, Xietu Road), Ren Youfeng (also known as Wuting, 30 years old, from Huzhou, residing at No. 44 Shangde Lane, Xujiahui Road), and Xu Agen (34 years old, from Suzhou, residing at No. 9 Lane 61, Tianyaoqiao Road) went to the Second Special Court to observe the hearing. The detectives from the political department of the French Patrol found that Zhao, Ren, and Xu were the perpetrators who had committed the violence together on the spot, and immediately arrested them and took them back to the patrol for investigation. Yesterday morning, the patrol sent Zhao and the other two to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. Judge Wang Gangxu, accompanied by clerk Ren Qiyuan, presided over the interrogation. Yuan Jiahong, the patrol's lawyer, presented the case and requested that the defendants be detained and the hearing be postponed to be combined with Wang Diansheng's case. Subsequently, Li Luchuan, a patrolman from No. 328, testified that he saw the first and third defendants committing violence on the spot. Wu Zhonghua, a patrolman from No. 319, testified that he saw the second defendant throwing an object into the accounting room. Tan Huisheng, a patrolman from No. 357, testified that although he could not prove that the defendants had committed the violence, he was beaten with a shoulder pole by Yang Jinkui. The three defendants denied participating in the violence on the spot. The court also summoned Merril (transliteration), the captain of the patrol in Avenue Pétain, to the stand and questioned him about the suppression at the Greater China Factory and whether he had seen the defendants committing violence. The court ordered that the defendants be remanded in custody and approved a postponement of the hearing to 2:00 PM on the 15th to be combined with the Wang Diansheng case. The defendants were remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Expresses</h3>
<p>The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, in response to the serious labor dispute that occurred at the Greater China Rubber Factory, immediately sent personnel to thoroughly investigate the truth. It also held a regular meeting yesterday. Committee members Zhu Xuefan, Li Mengnan, Zhou Xuexiang, Long Peiyun, Shao Xubai, and Ye Xianggao attended, with Zhu Xuefan presiding. The following measures were resolved: (1) Advise the factory to resume work immediately to maintain the livelihoods of the 1,600 workers. (2) Order the Second District Rubber Workers Union to inform all workers to strictly maintain order and wait quietly for the party and government to resolve the issue according to law. (3) Appoint Committee Member Li Mengnan to be responsible for handling the matter as appropriate.</p>
<h3>Emergency Meeting of the Workers' Side</h3>
<p>The Second District Rubber Workers Union convened an emergency meeting yesterday for the Greater China dispute case. Chairman Zhu Jinsheng reported on the progress of the labor unrest. The following cases were then discussed: (1) Send a letter to the Rubber Industry Association informing them of the progress of the disputes to avoid misunderstandings. (2) Schedule another petition to the party and government organs, demanding the rescue of union executive Wang Diansheng, who was arrested innocently. (3) Appeal to all industrial unions in the city to uphold justice and provide assistance. (4) Express condolences to worker Huang Jinsheng and others who were arrested and injured. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3>Factory Side Reports the Progress</h3>
<p>The Greater China Rubber Factory submitted a report to the party and government organs yesterday regarding the dispute, stating that workers deliberately caused trouble, injured people, and destroyed property. The report states that workers Qiu Guanqing and others at the Xujiahui Manufacturing Factory conspired to strike and caused trouble everywhere. The factory repeatedly tried to compromise but could not quell their ambition and requested an investigation. Qiu Guanqing and others have intensified their actions in recent days. On the morning of the day before yesterday, workers Zhang Youcai, Xue Jinhe, Huang Jinsheng, and others declared that blood would be shed. Unexpectedly, this came true after 1:00 PM that afternoon. At that time, the factory saw that many people were guarding the factory gate and also received reports from the administrators of each department that hundreds of people were aggressively forming a team to disrupt and coerce each department, using all means to their advantage. The factory knew that they intended to cause trouble and that reasoning was useless. Fearing an accident, the factory immediately reported to the French Patrol and requested that personnel be sent to protect the factory. The patrols had just arrived at the factory when Yang Zhenkui, Qiu Guanqing, Xi Qiying, and others, who were guarding the factory gate, reported to the hundreds of people inside the factory who were disrupting the area. They held hammers, shoulder poles, wooden sticks, and steel shoe stretchers and rushed out, attacking anyone they saw and destroying anything they encountered. The attacks resulted in the injuries of manager Xue Fuji, staff and workers Yu Xinghao, Wang Zhenan, Lu Xianggao, Zhang Jingyang, Fu Rongchun, Xue Alin, Fan Genlin, Lin Rongquan, and others, as well as many patrols, and the destruction of all doors, windows, and belongings in the accounting room. The factory was forced to suspend work under this violent coercion. The injured parties have reported the injuries to the patrol and filed a complaint with the court for investigation and prosecution according to law. Based on the facts and details, we request your review. Xue Fuji, representative of the Greater China Rubber Factory Xingye Co., Ltd.</p>

<h3>Hotels Automatically Organize Travel Industry Aviation Donation Fundraising Association</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Establish to Encourage Collection in Accordance with Regulations</p>
<p>The case of collecting aviation donations from the hotel industry in this city was suspended for a time due to repeated difficulties from the concession authorities. After the Municipal Government negotiated a satisfactory resolution, the collection continued. However, it was then stopped by the patrol. The hotels believe that aviation donations are essential for the national aviation construction and cannot be delayed. They believe that the patriotic actions of the people have their own sovereignty, but the concession authorities are illegally suppressing them. Therefore, they have expressed dissatisfaction. The hotels have automatically organized a Travel Industry Aviation Donation Fundraising Committee, which will convene an inaugural meeting on a scheduled date and encourage all members of the industry to collect donations in accordance with regulations.</p>
<h3>The Navy Department's Newly Built Large Dockyard Will Be Completed on Double Tenth Day</h3>

If Navy Chief Chen Shaokuan is unable to attend in person, he will send Director Wu of the Coast Guard to chair the ceremony and invite Mrs. Director Zeng Yijing to perform the ribbon-cutting ceremony. After the completion ceremony, the Yixian warship built by the factory will be the first to enter the dock, to symbolize the construction according to the legacy of the late Premier. At that time, the factory will invite various agencies and Chinese and foreign shipping companies to visit.</p>
<h3>Trade Bureau Convenes Meeting to Aid the Silk Industry</h3>
<p>In recent years, China's silk industry has suffered from the global recession and competition from Japanese silk and other silks in the international market, resulting in a sharp decline in sales. Silk factories have closed one after another, and the future of the silk industry is on the brink of danger. In order to seek assistance, the Ministry of Industry ordered He Bingxian, Director of the International Trade Bureau, Cai Wuji, Director of the Commodity Inspection Bureau, and Miao Zhongxiu, Director of the Raw Silk Section of the Inspection Bureau, to be responsible for studying promotional measures. It is learned that He and others specially invited leaders of the silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang to a meeting at the Bank Club at 6:00 PM on the 5th to discuss the promotion of raw silk and other issues. He Bingxian, Cai Wuji, Miao Zhongxiu, Ji Zejin, and representatives of silk factories and silk businesses in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, including Shen Huachen, Chu Huiseng, Xue Shouxuan, Zhang Yunsheng, Wu Shenbo, Wang Shiqiang, Xue Zukang, and Qian Fenghao, attended the meeting. He Bingxian chaired the meeting, reported on the purpose of convening the meeting, and hoped that all representatives would express their opinions as much as possible to provide research and serve as a reference for the development of the silk industry. After the report, Shen Huachen, Chu Huiseng, and others expressed their opinions. Various manufacturers submitted written opinions. After careful discussion and exchange of views, the opinions from all parties were handed over to Chairman He for sorting to provide a reference for assistance. The meeting adjourned at around 11:00 PM.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Thoroughly Investigates the Fuxin Factory's Flour Shipment to Tianjin Case</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, regarding the Fuxin Flour Factory's two shipments of factory flour to Tianjin via Japanese ships, after receiving reports from the Shipping Association and customs officials, forwarded letters to the Flour Guild for verification. Subsequently, according to the Flour Factory Guild's reply, they had received a letter from the Fuxin Flour Factory stating that they had received an inquiry from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce regarding the company's flour shipment issue, wanting to know the details.  The letter stated that on the 20th of last month, the company had 20,000 bags of flour sold through Sun Zhuxuan, and the choice of which ship to load them on was Sun's prerogative. Later, due to the daily price drops, it affected the payment of the goods. The company had no choice but to accommodate Sun's request and acted as a forwarding bank, which was indeed true, but the quantity was 20,000 bags, not 51,000 bags. Since this matter was handled by Sun, he should be responsible, etc., according to the previous reply. The City Chamber of Commerce, upon receiving the letter, immediately replied, stating that the Chamber had written to your association for inquiry regarding the loading of the factory's flour onto Japanese ships, a total of two times. The first time was based on a letter from the Shipping Association, stating that there were 80,000 bags of flour shipped to Tianjin, loaded on the Japanese ship Songshan Maru. The second time was based on a report from customs officials, stating that there were an additional</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>50,000 bags of flour shipped to Tianjin, loaded on the Japanese ship Tangshan Maru. Now, the Fuxin Factory's reply to your association only mentions that the third shipment on the Tangshan Maru was handled by Sun Zhuxuan and should be his responsibility. Then, who handled and who is responsible for the first shipment on the Songshan Maru? Why is there no mention of it at all? This seems to be evading responsibility. Furthermore, there is no mention of whether the Fuxin Factory will switch to domestic ships for future flour shipments. This lacks sincerity, making those who support domestic goods factories disappointed and sighing. We urge your association to write to the factory again, requesting a concrete response regarding the above two situations. This is our sincere request.</p>
<h3>New Buildings on Avenue Joffre</h3>
<p>A new market has been built east of the Paris Cinema on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. The market is conveniently located with good transportation. Inside, there are 21 storefronts and 10 modern residences. The building has a novel design with complete equipment, ample lighting, and good ventilation. There is a fountain in the market and two gardens beside the market, fully planted with seasonal flowers and trees, making it especially elegant. It is said that all but two or three of the 21 storefronts have been rented out and most have already moved in and started business. Business is extremely busy in each store, truly an excellent place for business. Furthermore, there is a brand new six-story building facing Avenue Joffre, consisting of five storefronts and fifteen residences. Everything is available, including hot and cold water pipes, radiators, electric stoves, bathrooms, and sanitary ware. The rent is also very cheap. It is said that the house contact office is the Avenue Joffre Paris Cinema next to the Avenue Joffre Market Office.</p>
<h3>Rescheduling of the General Council Meeting of the Aviation Association</h3>
<p>New Secretary-General Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Wojiang, the Standing Director and Secretary-General of the Chinese Aviation Association, requested to resign from his concurrent position. The council decided to retain him, but since Mr. Lin's resignation was firm, it was approved, and Yao Xijiu was asked to temporarily act as the secretary-general. Yao, whose courtesy name is Pingqing, specialized in military aviation in France. After returning to China, he served as the Deputy Director of the Aviation Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs. Upon accepting this appointment, he arrived in Shanghai yesterday to take office. Furthermore, the association's general council meeting was originally scheduled for the 15th of this month, but since many directors live far away, there were concerns that they would not receive the notice in time, so the date needs to be postponed, but it must be held within this month.</p>

<h3>The All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association Held its First Supervisory Committee Meeting Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Begging Letters from Huangpi and Huang'an Counties</h3>
<p>The Hubei Fellow-Provincials Association Disaster Relief Committee received a letter from Ding Yutian, which reads: "Respected Sirs, I, Yutian, returned to Huangpi around the eighth month of the lunar calendar due to family matters. Arriving at the border of Hubei Province, I witnessed a time of drought and flood disasters. Refugees, supporting the old and carrying the young, gathered extensively in Wuhan. Although the local authorities are making every effort to rescue them, the disaster area is vast and the number of disaster victims is large, making it extremely difficult to raise relief funds. According to my investigation, Huangpi and Huang'an counties are the most severely affected by this year's drought. In the southwest region, hundreds of miles of land are barren, farmland is cracked, and there is no harvest. If the victims do not migrate to other places, they will perish in ditches. Cries of sorrow echo across the fields. The situation is so tragic that one cannot bear to witness it. In the area above the Five Prefectures, there was rainfall in early August, and the late rice crop can still be saved to about 20-30%. However, Huangpi and Huang'an counties suffered severe drought. Drinking water is exhausted, not to mention farmland. Some families have even committed suicide due to starvation and thirst. The severity and tragedy of the disaster are unimaginable. Now, I hear that you gentlemen, following the precedent of the flood disaster twenty years ago, have established the Hubei Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai to raise a committee for the water and drought disaster relief in our province, raising funds through various channels to benefit the disaster victims. This shows your charitable heart and your concern for the suffering of others. Hearing this, I am filled with admiration. Because I have personally witnessed the severity of the disaster in the two counties, I respectfully write this letter to plead on behalf of the disaster victims. I implore you gentlemen, with your compassionate heart and your determination to thoroughly rescue people, to give as much as possible when remitting the relief funds, as each additional donation will save another life. Hurriedly, I cannot express the urgency of awaiting your orders. Sincerely, from Ding Yutian of Huangpi County."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Federation Submits Three Proposals to the Municipal Government</h3>
<p>Levy housing donations on vacant houses and set a deadline for building on vacant land</p>
<p>Quickly set a rent reduction plan to increase municipal income</p>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation, in order to request that the municipal authorities implement three measures to increase municipal revenue, submitted a document to the Municipal Government yesterday, which reads: "Regarding suggesting municipal facilities to increase municipal revenue, please review and approve. According to the suggestion of Executive Committee member Chen Jiufeng of our association, since the January 28th Incident, the market in Shanghai has plummeted. Industry and commerce are stagnant, and all industries are in decline. Liquidations and bankruptcies are heard of every day. The number of unemployed workers is increasing daily. The social economy is in extreme panic, and social order is also affected. As a result, municipal revenue has decreased sharply, and it has been necessary to increase vehicle and housing donations as supplements. However, under the current economic downturn, this only increases the burden on citizens, which is not a fundamental solution. As the ancients said, 'Controlling water is like following the flow,' which is indeed a correct statement. Therefore, for the current plan, three measures must be implemented to be effective: (1) Levy housing donations on vacant houses. The so-called housing donation originally refers to houses, without specifying whether they are used or not as the standard. Therefore, all so-called houses, regardless of whether they are inhabited or not, should be subject to donation. Because vacant houses are currently not subject to donation, the number of vacant houses will increase, and the amount of donation will inevitably decrease, which will have a greater impact on municipal revenue. Therefore, the Chinese Taxpayers' Association in the concessions has already decided through a representative meeting to write to the Public Works Department to levy housing donations on vacant houses. The situation in the urban area is the same, and it is especially important to take the lead in implementing this. This can prevent landlords from hoarding and raising rents, and it can also invisibly increase municipal revenue, which is a measure with multiple benefits. (2) Set a deadline for building on vacant land. Since the January 28th Incident, three years have passed. Although some construction has gradually recovered, rubble is everywhere, which not only obstructs the view but also hinders reconstruction. It is proposed that the Municipal Government order the landowners to complete the construction within one year and restore the old situation. If they exceed the deadline, the government will use public funds to build on their behalf, and the rental income will be used to offset the construction costs. The remainder will be used for municipal construction expenses. It is said that this method was implemented after the great earthquake in Japan, so its recovery was particularly rapid. (3) Quickly set a rent reduction plan. The rent reduction plan in Shanghai has not been resolved to date. The reasons and methods for rent reduction have been repeatedly presented by the Shanghai Rent Reduction Committee, so there is no need to repeat them. However, this matter is of great importance to the prosperity of commerce and the social economy. The municipal authorities should not ignore it, as this could lead to unrest. It is proposed to follow the rent reduction measures after the January 28th Incident and quickly promulgate a rent reduction plan to quell disputes and maintain the market. The above suggestions, whether appropriate or not, should be decided publicly, etc." Upon arrival, the Seventh Executive Committee of the Association discussed and agreed that the suggestions of Committee member Chen were insightful and decided to forward them to the Municipal Government for review and implementation. Therefore, this case is recorded and forwarded to the Municipal Government for your review and instruction. This is greatly appreciated. Sincerely presented to the Municipal Government, the First Special District Citizens' Federation.</p>
<h3>Central Government Sends Personnel to Handle the Labor Dispute at the Wusong Machinery Factory</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, after all the cadres of the Wusong Machinery Factory branch of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Union were escorted to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters on March 30 of this year, the central government ordered the Songhu Garrison Headquarters to investigate and found that Li Kuiyuan and eight others were innocent and were released. After Li and others were released from prison, the Railway Bureau immediately dismissed them from their positions. The two-way special party headquarters has repeatedly received reports from the union. In addition to forwarding them to the central government and writing to the Ministry of Railways and the Railway Bureau, urging them to reinstate the dismissed cadres immediately, the three standing committee members and secretary of the party headquarters of the railway bureau have visited the bureau several times to explain the facts of the case and negotiate earnestly, but no solution has been reached. Recently, it was learned that the party headquarters of the railway bureau received instructions from the central government to appoint Yang Donglin, secretary of the Central People's Movement Committee, to be responsible for handling the matter.

<h3>The Enthusiastic Corporate Deposits of Wing On Silver Company</h3>
<p>In recent years, rural areas have gone bankrupt, and the economy is in recession. Large amounts of cash are concentrated in cities, making it difficult to deposit and use. As a result, business is in severe decline, which concerns economic professionals. The Wing On Silver Company of this port, in response to these conditions, has the purpose of adjusting finance, assisting industrial and commercial development, promoting business as its goal. Since its opening, innovative plans have been emerging. Mr. Ou Jiancheng, the general manager of the company, is meticulously planning and resourceful. Yesterday, he told reporters that the domestic business decline is due to the dumping of foreign goods. The financial community is wary of economic changes, inevitably limiting depositors with low interest rates on the one hand and tightening investment loans on the other, which is generally stable, but the vitality of various domestic enterprises will be further reduced, gradually declining. Our company is selecting reliable manufacturers to provide convenient loans to facilitate the sales of domestic goods and restore profits. Also, small businesses affect the people's livelihood most, and it is most difficult to gather funds. Even if there are small funds, they cannot enjoy the combination and use due to the low interest rates in the market. Therefore, this time, we have specially set up a kind of corporate deposit to show our best efforts to promote it. The term is only five years, which cannot be said to be long. The interest rate combined with weekly compound interest is more than one cent, which is thick enough. The reason why we do not hesitate to lose money and give preferential interest is nothing more than to support and encourage everyone to work together. After five years, all corporate depositors of our company can use their principal and interest, which is almost doubled, to do a considerable business. As for special aspects, such as old-age care, marriage, education, fines, and gifts, this type of deposit is also applicable. Its interest rate is superior to any bank savings, and there is no long period of ten or fifteen years. Since the announcement began, customers have been coming to deposit in an endless stream. However, in order to maintain the operational plan, there is a limited period and amount. Those who are quick will get it, and once the amount is full, it will be closed and will not be extended.</p>

<h3>Pudong Native Place Association Holds Groundbreaking Ceremony</h3>

<p>Seven or Eight Hundred Members and Guests Attend</p>
<p>The Pudong Native Place Association purchased a site of more than 2.9 mu on Edward Road (next door to the Guanghua Cinema in the Public Concession) and held a groundbreaking ceremony yesterday. After 1:00 PM, members of the Pudong Native Place Association and guests arrived successively. The meeting started at 2:00 PM, with about seven or eight hundred people attending, making it a grand occasion. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Venue Arrangement</h3>
<p>The association's address faced Edward Road. A colored shed was erected high at the entrance, with party flags and national flags crossed, and a horizontal inscription read "Pudong Native Place Association Building Association Hall Groundbreaking Ceremony." A hall was built inside the venue, with a stage and benches arranged in front of it, which was quite tidy.</p>
<h3>Number of Attendees</h3>
<p>Those who attended the ceremony and those who came to observe included Du Yuesheng, Mu Ouchu, Huang Renzhi, Shen Menglian, Lü Yuequan, Chen Zixin, Pan Zhiwen, Zhang Yutian, Jiang Zhuoyun, Zhang Xiaoliang representing Gu Daosheng, Zhao Zengtao, Zhao Peiquan, Min Caizhang, Gu Wensheng, Zhang Bochu, Shen Jiyi, Feng Yixiang, Jia Jinfang, Jiang Shengtao, Shen Xingyuan, Lu Wenshao, Xi Derun, Jin Hongxiang, Wu Liusheng, Cao Zhiyuan, Yan Hanwen, Song Dazhang, Qu Shaoyi, and Si Sheng Primary and Middle School, Zhengdong Primary School, Yangjing Primary School, Yangsi Primary School, the Fourth Team of the Yangjing District Security Corps, the Pudong District Fire Brigade, as well as guests Yuan Lüdeng, Hong Yanbing, and others, totaling seven or eight hundred people.</p>
<h3>Grand Opening Ceremony</h3>
<p>The meeting was scheduled to begin at 2:00 PM. Gu Wensheng served as the master of ceremonies, and the full military band of the Puyi Vocational Training Center played music. The five executive directors, including Du Yuesheng, formed the presidium. Everyone stood in solemn silence and paid the highest respect to the national party flag and the portrait of the late Premier. Executive Director Mu Ouchu respectfully read the Premier's will. Next, Executive Director Du Yuesheng delivered the opening address (the speech is recorded later). The groundbreaking ceremony began with three bows, followed by music. Then, Director Zhang Bochu read the inscription on the cornerstone. Next, Executive Director Du and others broke ground towards the southeast, setting off firecrackers. The sound of crackling and explosions reverberated through the clouds. For a time, those gathered outside the gate to watch were as crowded as a wall. Music was played, photos were taken, and refreshments were served.</p>
<h3>Opening Speech</h3>
<p>Executive Director Du read the groundbreaking speech, saying, "Our Pudong Native Place Association, when it was established in August of the 20th year of the Republic of China, publicly discussed building an association hall. It was not until February of the 22nd year that this site of nearly three mu on Edward Road was purchased, costing over 228,000 yuan. The new association hall, whose construction begins today, is an eight-story building constructed of steel and concrete, occupying a total area of more than 16,000 square feet. The designer is Mr. Xi Fuquan of Pudong, a doctor of engineering in architecture from the Berlin University of Technology in Germany. At the same time, consulting engineers Du Daqing, Li Jinpei, Xue Cixin, and Jin Danyi, as well as Ling Yunzhou, Zhao Peiquan, Yang Chuqiao, and Xu Pudong Native Place Association Groundbreaking Ceremony (photographed by Wang Kai)</p>
<p>Zhenfan and others unanimously supported it before this design was decided. The winning bidder for the contract was Zhang Zhiliang, the owner of the Xinshengji Construction Factory in Pudong. Our board of directors has a special committee for building the association hall, and the person in charge of all this is Mr. Zhang Xiaoliang, the director of our association and the overall leader of the Shanghai construction industry. The estimated construction and equipment costs are about 360,000 yuan, bringing the total cost including the land price to about 588,000 yuan. Relying on the enthusiasm and efforts of our fellow villagers and supporters from all walks of life, the results of the two fundraising campaigns last year and this year have raised nearly 300,000 yuan, which is about half of the total land price and construction cost. Why do we want to build this new association hall? Is it to show off for the people of Pudong? No, no. Is it for the people of Pudong to hold meetings and work? Still not right. As you know, in the drawings we have, in addition to the hall, offices, and club, there are also banks, hospitals, and supplementary schools, reading rooms, etc. All cultural, economic, and health needs of the people have considerable practical contributions. You know, all this is not only for the people of Pudong to enjoy, but all the people of Shanghai can come and enjoy it, and all Chinese people can come and enjoy it. The eight-story building built by our Pudong Native Place Association is not only serving the people of Pudong, but serving all the people of Shanghai, serving all the people of China. The people of Pudong today must not forget the old generation of the past, so there are various memorials. The people of Pudong must have a future, and must not forget the descendants in the future, so they must also run various education programs. With this brand-new native place association, we hope to turn Pudong into a new Pudong, and turn each and every one of us Pudong people into new Pudong people who strive to serve the country and society. This fundraising is a major test of whether we Pudong people are enthusiastic about public welfare, whether our spirit is united, and whether we are healthy. I would now like to represent the Native Place Association and thank the fellow villagers and supporters from all walks of life for their enthusiasm and efforts, which have made the fundraising such a good and rapid success. Those who have donated a lot of money are, of course, especially appreciated, even if the amount is limited, even as little as one yuan, he has done his best, and we should thank him equally. I also deeply believe that those who are enthusiastic and hardworking in supporting our association in the future will continue to donate, so that this eight-story building will become a flower of enthusiasm for their love of the hometown and love of the community. Let the people of Pudong rise up, serve the people of Pudong, serve all the people of Shanghai, serve all the people of China, serve all mankind, work together, with one mind and one heart, to lay an indestructible foundation for our Chinese nation. If you don't believe me, there is such a stone."</p>
<h3>Post-Meeting Notes</h3>

<h3>A Life Lost for a Half-Dollar Debt</h3>
<p>Yang CaiKang Died Pitifully</p>
<p>Monk Gao Still Tries to Deny Responsibility</p>
<p>Yang CaiKang, from Tongzhou, made a living by doing small business. Three years ago, due to a lack of capital, he borrowed one dollar from Monk Gao, a fellow villager who worked at a tofu shop in Yaojia Stone Bridge, West Shanghai. Up to now, in addition to paying back half a dollar, he still owed five dimes. Unexpectedly, such a small amount led to a major case of homicide. Since both were poor people, they valued money as their lives. On August 1st of this year, Monk Gao demanded the debt from Yang CaiKang without success, which led to an argument and then a mutual scuffle and fight. At that time, people persuaded them to separate. Unexpectedly, after more than ten days, Yang CaiKang suddenly died. Yang’s father, Yang Changming, claimed that his son was actually killed by Monk Gao’s violent beating, and requested a thorough investigation. He reported to the District Court. Prosecutor Zhang Zi arrived at the scene and confirmed that the deceased Yang Zikang had fist wounds on both sides of his ribs, which triggered an old illness and caused his death. He immediately detained Monk Gao for preliminary interrogation, and after confirmation, filed a lawsuit with the Criminal Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Guan Liting specially opened the tenth court for trial. First, the father of the deceased, Yang Changming, testified. He was 55 years old, from Tongzhou, and made a living by pushing a cart. My son, Yang CaiKang, was killed by Monk Gao’s violent beating. I ask for justice, and also ask for private prosecution, as well as clothing, coffin, funeral, and other expenses of three thousand three hundred yuan. (Question) Has your son been sick before? (Answer) No. The official said, according to the forensic doctor's examination, your son suffered from heart disease and nephritis before he died. (Answer) No. The official ordered the imprisoned Monk Gao to be brought to the case. He testified that he was 33 years old, and was friends with Yang CaiKang. There was an argument because he asked for an old debt, but he did not beat him. It was a real injustice. (Question) If you didn't hit him, why did he sue you? (Answer) I don't know. However, after I argued with Yang CaiKang, he was caught stealing sacks, or he was beaten and injured by someone, and then taken away by the police. At this point, the police from the Fourth District arrived and proved that on July 18th, Yang CaiKang stole a sack. After being brought to the station, he was sentenced to three days of detention. The official then invited Prosecutor Zhang Zi to the court to argue the case, and then began the debate. Lawyer Zhou Yu defended the defendant Monk Gao for a long time, and then asked for a verdict of innocence. The plaintiff's lawyer, Chen Wenxiang, stood up and asked to pursue a private prosecution for three thousand three hundred yuan. The official believed that the case was clear, and then ordered the debate to end, and scheduled the verdict to be announced at 2:00 PM on the 12th of this month. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Qiu Qinghang, Accused of Embezzling 50,000 Yuan, is Transferred to the District Court</h3>
<p>The Embezzlement Case Occurred in Xiamen</p>
<p>The First Special District Court Has No Jurisdiction</p>
<p>Qiu Qinghang, a native of Hangzhou, residing at No. 7 Deshun Lane, Muir Ming Road, was appointed by the Shanghai Four Banks Savings Association as the manager of the Xiamen branch in 1919 of the Republic of China. While in office, Qiu deposited 10,000 yuan in the Bank of China and South Seas in the name of the branch, but recorded 60,000 yuan in the account, embezzling a huge sum of 50,000 yuan. It has been four years. It was not until August of this year that the Shanghai head office transferred Qiu to Shanghai to work in the head office. After another person, Mr. Huang, was appointed to take over the Xiamen branch, he checked all the incoming and outgoing account books and discovered Qiu's fraud. He telegraphed the Shanghai head office and reported it to the General Police Station, who sent detectives to arrest Qiu and bring him to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. It is now known that Presiding Judge Feng Shide of this case found that Qiu Qinghang's crime occurred in Xiamen, so this court has no jurisdiction. Therefore, at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, he sent police to escort Qiu Qinghang to the Nanshi District Court for interrogation. Chief Prosecutor Lou Ying sent personnel to interrogate him and ordered him to be detained for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Undutiful Son and Daughter-in-Law Neglect Elderly Mother</h3>
<p>The Mother Has No Choice But to Sue</p>
<p>The Judge Advises Reconciliation</p>
<p>Wang Ashun, a local resident of No. 8 Yuqing Lane, Xin Ya Lü Road, married Zhang. Because he and his wife mistreated his 65-year-old stepmother Wang Shen, they usually treated her with harsh words and expressions, and ordered her to sleep with the maid. On June 16th, the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law had another argument. When Zhang was lying on the bed, trying the taste of opium, she took an opium pipe and beat her stepmother. Ashun was naturally henpecked and dared not rebuke his impudent wife. Instead, he acted as an accomplice. The old woman left home in anger that day and wanted to commit suicide in the Huangpu River. She was rescued by a Mr. Wu and sent to the home of a female staff member surnamed Yuan at a certain institution for rescuing women and children. She asked her to find a solution. After Ms. Yuan asked the old woman about the details, in addition to temporarily placing the old woman in her home, she personally went to the Wang family and advised Ashun and his wife to welcome the old mother back to avoid being displaced, or to provide a monthly living allowance so that she could live separately and end her remaining years. However, Ashun and his wife did not listen to the advice. The old woman hired a lawyer to file a criminal self-accusation of abandonment against her son and daughter-in-law in the First Special District District Court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu opened a court to hear the plaintiff Wang Shen's complaint about being abused by her son and daughter-in-law, saying that although she was not in danger of freezing or starvation on weekdays, she never gave her any money for other expenses since her husband died, and often added harsh words and expressions, which made people uncomfortable. The three thousand yuan in cash and six rooms left to me by my husband have all been taken away by the defendants, and the clothes and gold utensils in the box have also been taken away. She requested that they be ordered to return them. When questioned, both defendants denied abuse, saying that there were a total of nine people in the family, including sons, daughters, and grandchildren. Living expenses depended entirely on the income earned by the sons, daughters, and grandchildren, and there was no spare capacity to provide separate expenses for the plaintiff. When she left home, they only knew that she was going to her son-in-law's place. Later, when they heard that she was at Ms. Yuan's place, they went to welcome her, but she was unwilling to return home. Subsequently, Ms. Yuan arrived in court to testify about the mediation process, saying that after the plaintiff was sent to my place by Mr. Wu, I immediately went to the Wang family to persuade the defendant couple to order them to welcome the mother back. Afterwards, only Wang Ashun came to my house and promised to give the plaintiff seven or eight yuan per month for her to live separately. However, how can this amount be enough?</p>
<p>I and a person surnamed Shen advised Wang to give twenty yuan a month, but Wang's family affairs are controlled by his wife, and Ashun did not dare to promise without his wife's permission,</p>
<p>So the mediation failed. Judge Wu immediately advised the two defendants to respect their elders and welcome the old mother back to support her, otherwise they would have to provide twenty yuan for her living expenses. Ashun, upon hearing the advice, looked at his wife's expression, so his answers were initially hesitant, and finally he complied with the court's order. However, the plaintiff seemed unable to immediately decide on the matter of settling the case with twenty yuan per month, so the result was still that Judge Wu ordered them to go out for reconciliation and wait for further inquiry.</p>
<h3>Wang Zheng Claims to be the President of a School and Cheats Money</h3>
<p>Moves to Escape and is Spotted by Students</p>
<p>The Police Station Has Been Notified and Filed a Criminal Lawsuit</p>
<p>Wang Zheng, a native of Chuansha, 34 years old, residing at No. 19 Dahua Lane, Boer Road, Nanyang Bridge, French Concession, published an advertisement in the Xinwen Bao on August 19th of this year, establishing the Yadong Science and Art Association, serving as its president, recruiting drawing trainees, graduating in three months, and promising that after graduation, they could earn a salary of twenty yuan per month and be introduced to a job. After this advertisement was published, starting from the 13th of the same month, Hua Shusheng (18 years old, from Wuxi), Liu Deming, Yang Chengfu, Wang Shifa, Xue Shinan, Jin Lanfang, Xu Guoting, Zhu Yongfa, Zhang Hangen, Zhang Liying, Xu Xiubao, Chen Deyang, and thirteen other people successively signed up and paid fees to practice drawing. The fees paid by each person ranged from ten yuan to thirty yuan. Before the practice time was even two months, at 8:00 AM on the 5th of this month, he actually hired a moving truck to transport all the furniture and items in his residence, trying to escape. When he was spotted by the trainee students, they questioned Wang, and Wang had no words to answer. The two sides immediately scuffled into the French Police Station. After interrogation by the police chief, Wang Zheng had collected a total of 295 yuan in fees paid by the students, which was actually fraudulent behavior. He was immediately ordered to be detained. Yesterday, he was escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court for interrogation by Judge Wu Fanglian. The police lawyer Chen Ming stated the case and requested a postponement to conduct a detailed investigation and file a lawsuit. The plaintiff students sent Hua Shusheng as a representative to the case to state the previous situation. After the official questioned the defendant, the defendant's lawyer Wang Shizong said that he requested that the defendant be allowed to be released on bail pending further instructions during the rescheduling because the defendant's family had four young children who had no one to take care of them temporarily. Because the police opposed bail, the court did not approve the request, and then ordered a rescheduling on the 9th to investigate and interrogate again. The defendant was still returned to custody.</p>
<h3>A Sun Deck Collapses, Seriously Injuring Seven People</h3>
<p>Rotting House Cannot Bear Weight</p>
<p>Blood Flows All Over the Ground, How Terrible</p>
<p>The Jin Xieji Leather Factory at No. 2 Wangjiazhai, Huiwen Road, Zhabei, has a large scale and excellent products, and is very popular in society. It also has a distribution office at the west end of Nanyang Bridge in the French Concession. The factory employs more than 40 workers, and its factory base is also quite impressive, with seven buildings and more than ten bungalows. However, they are all old houses. Yesterday afternoon at about 4:30, the factory engineer named Wang Guifu, 35 years old, from Ningbo, supervised six workers in tanning leather on the sun deck. The sun deck was dilapidated due to years of disrepair, and the wood had rotted due to the continuous autumn rains in recent days. It suddenly encountered many people working and could not bear the weight. With a roaring sound, the entire sun deck collapsed, causing all those working on it to be seriously injured. Bones were broken and legs were fractured on the spot, and blood flowed all over the ground, which was unbearable to see. There were Wang Baiyi, 17 years old, from Ningbo, whose large intestine flowed out; Zhang Zitang, 36 years old, from Yuyao, who suffered abdominal injuries; Wang Axing, 17 years old, whose right foot bone was broken; Ye Guoxing, 24 years old, from Dinghai, who injured his foot; Kong Fasheng, 22 years old, from Nanjing, who injured his foot; Chen Guixiang, 36 years old, from Ningbo, who injured his foot; and the engineer Wang Guifu also suffered serious injuries to his foot.

<h3>Hong Chengde's Concubine Returns to Shanghai, the Case of a Concubine is Examined Again</h3>
<p>Plaintiff Chen Wang Did Not Arrive</p>
<p>The Court Ordered a Rescheduling for Further Interrogation</p>
<p>The former famous prostitute Yifei Laoliu, after being given by Xie Peide to Yang Binghu, the grandson of Yang Qiusun, a compradore of Puyi Real Estate Company, as his wife, divorced Binghu due to opposition from the Yang family. Then they committed suicide together in the residence of Yu Mengzhu, Hong Chengde's beloved concubine. Several months after the incident, Yifei's mother, Chen Wang, claimed that her daughter's death was caused by a conspiracy between Xie Peide, Hong Chengde, and Hong's concubine, and filed a lawsuit in the First Special District District Court against Xie and others for murder. Except that Hong's concubine could not be summoned, Xie Peide and Hong Chengde had both surrendered themselves. Judge Wu Zehan investigated the matter and ruled that the two defendants were innocent. The part of Yu Mengzhu being sued was decided to be reviewed after she arrived in court. Now that Ms. Yu has returned to Shanghai from Qingdao to escape the summer heat, yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu continued to open the court for trial. Ms. Yu and her defense lawyer Zuo Dedao surrendered to the court on time, but the plaintiff Chen Wang was not seen. Judge Wu questioned Yu Mengzhu, who testified that she was 24 years old and lived at No. 1 Jiang'an Lane, Ladu Road, French Concession. The court then ordered a rescheduling to wait for the plaintiff to arrive in court for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Good Things Are Hard to Come By, Chang Chongxuan Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>Although Lovers Are Good, Parents Oppose</p>
<p>Young People Taking Poison is Sad</p>
<p>Chang Chongxuan, 25 years old, from Taixing, was an employee in the Guangzhong Dyeing and Weaving Factory at No. 645 Kunming Road, Pudong, and currently lived in the factory dormitory at No. 376 Liaoyang Road. Chang was young and suave, and recently became acquainted with a fellow villager named Jia. The two were affectionate and wanted to grow old together. They had secretly sworn an oath. The woman's family was old-fashioned, and when her parents found out about this, they insisted on opposing it and strictly controlled the woman. Chang, suffering this blow, knew that good things were hard to come by. After thinking about it, he was indignant and tired of the world. He secretly swallowed opium and committed suicide the day before yesterday. Later, his colleague Lu Nianci discovered it and immediately informed the factory director and Chang's brother Chang Wen. They took him to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective and he died. The hospital reported it to the Yulin Road Police Station, who ordered detectives to investigate and transferred the body to the Philan Road Coroner's Office. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the First Special District District Court, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the office to examine the body. According to the report of the deceased's brother Chang Wen, 26 years old, who lived at No. 348 Henan Road, my brother suddenly took poison the day before yesterday. I didn't know about it at first. After someone told me, I went to the hospital to visit him. After the doctor resuscitated him, I saw that his mind was slightly clearer. I immediately asked him what was going on. He said at that time that he wanted to marry a woman, but the other party's parents insisted on not allowing it, so he took this step. Now I ask to take the body away. According to Lu Nianci's report, Guo declared that the deceased Chang Chongxuan, male, died from opium poisoning during his lifetime. The body was handed over to his brother Chang Wen to coffin and bury after signing a guarantee.</p>

<p>Imports of Games and Toys Exceed 660,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Eight Months of Game Numbers</p>
<p>At this time of serious national crisis and industrial and commercial difficulties, the import of consumer goods has increased year by year. Some people even call for saving the country without forgetting entertainment. People with a sense of awareness and concern for the times believe that this is a sound of national subjugation. The International Trade Bureau had previously announced that the import volume of games and toys for six months exceeded 500,000 yuan. Yesterday morning, reporters from the Datong News Agency learned from the bureau that the total import volume for eight months had an upward trend. The total import volume of games and toys for eight months this year was 339,629 gold units, equivalent to more than 664,000 yuan in national currency. Compared with the same period last year, the increase reached one-fifth. The import volume for the same period of eight months last year was 292,607 gold units, equivalent to more than 580,000 yuan in national currency. As for the national aspect, Japan has the most. Although the national crisis is so serious, the import of games and toys has increased so dramatically, which is truly regrettable.</p>
<h3>The Flourishing Development of Oil Mills After the Implementation of the New Tariff</h3>
<p>The Changde Factory Hosted a Tour for Various Sectors Yesterday</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the new tariff in July this year, the import tariff on soybeans (yellow beans) has increased from 10% ad valorem to 15%. Consequently, the import of soybeans and soybean oil from the Eastern Provinces has drastically decreased. This has led to the flourishing of domestically established oil mills, producing soybean oil to meet domestic consumption. Currently, there are already six oil mills in this city. Yesterday, the Changde Oil Mill in Pudong, in order to arouse the interest of various sectors, specially prepared a steamer at the Bund Bronze Statue Pier to invite gentry, merchants, and other sectors to visit. Those who accepted the invitation included Gu Xin’yi, Chairman of the Bean and Rice Association; Mao Jingchou, Chairman of the Shanghai Hunanqu District Firefighting Joint Association; a representative from Zhang Gongquan, General Manager of the Bank of China; Wang Qing’ao, Director of the Nanshi Office; and over twenty other people. They crossed the river to Pudong and disembarked at the Changde Oil Mill pier, where Chen Jixin, the factory manager, led them to visit various departments. Afterwards, refreshments were served. The tour concluded at four o'clock when the original steamer returned to Shanghai. The factory occupies six mu of land along the riverbank and is divided into a steaming room, an oil pressing room, a screening room, workers' dormitories, and an engine room. The scale is quite grand. There are forty-eight oil pressing machines, and five large oil pools capable of holding two thousand four hundred dan of oil. Each day and night, it can produce over two hundred dan of soybean oil and four thousand bean cakes. The daily raw material (soybeans) requirement is sixty-eight thousand jin. This raw material is entirely purchased from the four provinces of Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui, and absolutely no foreign goods are used. The oil produced is mostly sold in the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, with Zhejiang being the largest market. As for the bean cake, it is an excellent fertilizer, widely sold in Guangdong, Fujian, the Nanyang Islands, and other places, with demand greatly exceeding supply. It is truly one of the most promising emerging industries.</p>

<p>Education News</p>
<h3>Actively Expanding Slave Education Under Japanese Puppet Anesthesia</h3>
<p>▲Dense Population in Puppet Capital, More Primary and Secondary Schools</p>
<p>▲Establishing Japanese Language Teaching Institutes, Suppressing Private Schools</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from Changchun, Northeast) After the Japanese puppets presumptuously established Changchun as the capital of the puppet organization, the city's goods have become increasingly prosperous, and the population has gradually become dense. The number of school-age children has also increased compared to before, so the original schools are not enough to accommodate them, which makes it difficult to achieve its purpose of popularizing slave education. Therefore, the puppet municipal government allocated funds to build six primary and secondary schools. In addition, the Liaoning Puppet Provincial Government established Japanese language teaching institutes, suppressed private schools, and selected elementary school teachers to study in Japan in order to centralize the authority of slave education and make the general youth forget their ancestors, and their slave nature will be gradually domesticated, with no national concept at all. The details are recorded as follows.</p>
<h3>Popularizing Slave Education</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the Japanese puppets' accumulated construction, the puppet nest seems to be increasingly consolidated, the market has suddenly become prosperous, and the population has become dense. The number of school-age children has also increased compared to before. There are a total of 22 municipal and private primary schools in the puppet capital, which are already feeling unable to accommodate them. In order to create true pro-Japanese and pro-"Manchukuo" citizens, we must start with children's education. Therefore, for the more than 1,000 children who have recently increased in the city, we will actively impart slave education to them in order to easily domesticate them in the future. Therefore, the puppet municipal government and the Japanese are planning to add primary schools in the puppet capital. It is decided to add 100,000 yuan to the education budget this year to add five primary schools and one middle school. It is heard that the plan to add schools has been submitted to the puppet Ministry of Civil Affairs for approval. After approval, we will start to select the addresses of each school and prepare construction materials and design and build school buildings. In addition, we will borrow 200,000 yuan from the South Manchuria Railway to purchase more than 5,000 mu of vacant land in front of the former square of the puppet Ministry of Civil Affairs and start building various schools. It is expected that all of them will be completed around July and August next year. Each of these newly built primary schools can accommodate about 1,500 children. If the new school buildings are successfully built in the future, the previous old school buildings will not be used at all, and all 1,000 children will be moved into the new school buildings in order to promote their slave education as much as possible and make it a source of propaganda for the Kingly Way.</p>
<h3>Establishing Japanese Language Teaching Institutes</h3>
<p>(Shenyang News) The Liaoning Department of Education has recently drafted regulations for the establishment of Japanese language teaching institutes in order to enslave the youth, which will be announced soon. The purpose is to make the general young students proficient in the technical aspects of Japanese. Therefore, the teaching methods of various schools stipulate the establishment of Japanese language teaching institutes and technical training institutes in order to popularize the study of Japanese and seek a steady increase in pro-Japanese elements. In addition, the puppet "Fengtian" Provincial Government has recently received an order from the puppet Ministry of Education to select outstanding elementary school teachers from across the country for the third time to study in Japan in order to learn from them and fundamentally reform elementary school education in the Northeast. The purpose is to make young people's pro-Japanese psychology gradually universal. The puppet provincial government followed this and issued a notice to all counties under its jurisdiction to select candidates.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn Children's Weekly</p>
<h3>Independent Spirit</h3>
<p>— Zhang Nancun</p>
<p>Chinese people are mostly dependent, and this is cultivated from a young age. "Opening their mouths for food, reaching out for clothes," they are pampered and spoiled. Their mothers must worry about whether they are cold, hot, hungry, or full, and they don't need to pay attention themselves. Even when they grow up, they are still muddleheaded, not knowing cold or heat, not asking about hunger or fullness, only knowing how to rely on their parents for life. They don't even know how to put things away or how to do things. They can't even take care of themselves, so how can they talk about doing anything for society or the country? From all of this, the independent spirit is invisibly destroyed.</p>
<p>Japanese children who go to school and live far from home mostly bring their own meals. By the time they eat, the food is already cold, so they eat it cold. The dishes are a few pieces of dried radish. The better ones are a few pieces of salted fish. Such hardship is precisely what tempers their naive and natural independent spirit, which is the opposite of the habits of Chinese children.</p>
<p>Another thing is that China has an inheritance system. I have seen some children who, as long as their parents are very rich, think that they will have money to use in the future, so they don't strive. Even if these people can conserve their wealth, they are no more than useless people. Moreover, in this day and age, it is truly "better to have a skill than to accumulate wealth." Personal changes make it difficult to guarantee property against accidental losses. Moreover, the national crisis is severe, and the whole country needs to unite and work together to save it. How can we give up on ourselves like this? As for foreigners' inheritance, it is not necessarily left to their descendants, so children have an independent spirit, and the country is strong. From this perspective, whether children have an independent spirit is related to the strength or weakness of the country. Looking at the big picture from the small, it is better to get rid of dependence.</p>
<h3>The Poor Student Fan Zhongyan</h3>
<p>— Ning Ziqiang</p>
<p>In the past, there was a poor student named Fan Zhongyan. When he was a child, he studied in a monk's temple on Changbai Mountain. Every day, he cooked two sheng of rice and put it in a pot. After waiting overnight, the porridge congealed, and he cut it into four pieces with a knife. He ate two pieces in the morning and evening, eating salty vegetables with the porridge. Wasn't that extreme hardship?</p>
<p>Later, he passed the imperial examination and became a scholar, so he "worried about the world before others and enjoyed the world after others, taking the world as his responsibility." Such responsibility was also obtained from his hard study!</p>
<h3>Self-Confidence</h3>
<p>— Jin Xi</p>
<p>Is your arithmetic not as good as theirs? Did the teacher say that your method is not smooth enough? Did you fail several subjects during the semester exams? Did you repeat a grade this semester?</p>
<p>These are indeed very worrying problems.</p>
<p>I hope you don't worry. From now on, you should build up your self-confidence. You must be confident that your academic subjects will be better than your classmates, and that your exam results at the end of the semester will not lag behind others.</p>
<p>Self-confidence is a kind of strength that can urge you to make progress.</p>
<p>"My math scores are not good. I am confident that I will catch up with them. When I get an arithmetic problem, I first grasp the main points of the problem, understand the meaning of the problem, and then start to calculate. If the first calculation is wrong, I will come again the second time, and even calculate many times, until I get the correct answer. At the same time, I will calculate more of these kinds of arithmetic problems to make sure I am 'proficient through practice.' When I encounter difficulties in calculating, I will never ask someone to solve it for me unless it is absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>"My composition scores are too poor. From now on, I should read more books and read more extracurricular readings, study the method of applying words and sentences in the books, and extract the beautiful words and phrases in the books. When writing compositions in the future, I will appropriately apply these kinds of words and sentences into them.</p>
<p>As long as you are confident that you will not lag behind others, you will surely surpass others. Self-confidence can inspire your ambition!</p>
<h3>My Family's Cat</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Those bright, sparkling eyes, that slender body, that cat with long, black fur. It seems afraid, hiding in the kitchen, not daring to step more than a foot or two outside. Eating is its instinct; if a small dish is placed on the table and one isn't careful, it's already in its mouth.</p>
<p>At meal times, it insists on eating the good stuff, not even sniffing at leftover rice.</p>
<p>When night falls, it's unbearable. The entire house becomes the playground for mice. So, at night, we specifically bring those two cats into the house, but what's the use? Clothes are torn, the noise is still loud, disturbing one's sleep. Have the cats and mice perhaps signed a peace treaty?</p>
<p>"The ancients said, 'A cat can manage seven households.' But my family's cat can't manage even one, and I'm afraid it can't even manage itself," Grandmother often scolds the cat in this way.</p>
<p>Oh, cat! You have sharp teeth, silent paws, and long whiskers, all good tools for catching mice. Why don't you use them? Instead, you're scolded for being lazy. Do you even realize that?</p>
<p>Cat! You only know how to eat, not how to work. What's the point of keeping you?</p>
<p>Children, think about it: "Am I like this kind of cat myself?"</p>
<h3>Good Older Sister</h3>
<p>— Twelve-year-old elementary school student Zhong Shan Yan</p>
<p>My older sister treats me really well, so I'm giving my older sister a big floral padded jacket.</p>
<p>On the jacket is embroidered a string of purple grapes.</p>
<p>Dad saw it and said "Wonderful!" Mom saw it and said "Great!"</p>
<p>My older sister, wearing the big floral padded jacket, opens her mouth and laughs heartily, and from then on, treats me exceptionally well.</p>
<h3>Sunlight</h3>
<p>Oh sunlight, sunlight! You've quietly climbed onto the eastern window.</p>
<p>You give me warmth.</p>
<p>You let me know the time.</p>
<p>I wish you could stay a little longer.</p>
<p>But you leave so quickly again.</p>
<h3>Children's Science Lecture: Lenses</h3>
<p>— Lin Yin</p>
<p>Last time, we talked about convex lenses creating inverted images of candlelight. The reason is very simple. Just look at (Figure 1) and you'll understand. Lenses have a focusing effect, so the application of lenses is very extensive. Even our eyes have lenses (Figure 2). If we didn't have lenses, we wouldn't be able to see anything. And the lens in our eyes can become thicker or thinner. When looking at distant objects, the lens thins; when looking at near objects, the lens thickens. Everyone might as well try it. As in (Figure 3), stretch out a finger in front of your eyes and stare at it for a few minutes. Then, when you look at something far away with that eye, you'll find it blurry and unclear. Similarly, if you stare at something far away and then look at something nearby, you definitely won't be able to see it clearly. But when this lens expansion and contraction isn't free and easy, some people can only see distant objects clearly (farsightedness), and some can only see near objects clearly (nearsightedness). They both need to borrow external lenses to help (wear glasses). Concave lenses are used for nearsightedness, and convex lenses are called lenses for farsightedness.</p>
<p>Another use of convex lenses is to use them as magnifying glasses. Even very small flowers and insects can be seen very clearly when viewed with a magnifying glass. For example, the snowflakes in (Figure 4), we certainly wouldn't see that shape with our naked eyes, but when we look at them under a microscope, we know they are six-pointed flowers. Thus, because of the magnifying effect of convex lenses, telescopes were invented. Now everyone knows that the inventor of the telescope was the famous Galileo. But the motivation and confirmation were given by an apprentice in a lens shop in Anster, Holland. He accidentally looked at distant objects through two lenses (Figure 5) and discovered an unexpected miracle. From then on, the telescope was invented.</p>
<h3>Woodcutter Zhao Da</h3>
<p>— Wu Xiongjian</p>
<p>Zhao Da is a woodcutter. Every day he goes into the mountains to collect firewood. After collecting a lot of firewood, he carries it down the mountain to sell to people living below, turns it into money, and then buys many things to eat and use to take back up the mountain.</p>
<p>Every day, Zhao Da carries down the mountain a load of firewood weighing one hundred and fifty or two hundred catties, but when people down the mountain weigh it, it's always three to five catties more than what it weighed on the mountain. He thinks that his own weighing is very accurate.</p>
<p>The things he buys from down the mountain always weigh less when he weighs them on the mountain than they did when weighed down the mountain. He thinks the shopkeepers down the mountain are dishonest and often give short weight.</p>
<p>Actually, children, I'll tell you: Zhao Da's scale is the same as the one used by the people down the mountain. The firewood weighed down the mountain hasn't increased, and the weight of the things weighed on the mountain hasn't decreased.</p>
<p>So why is there a difference between the weight measured on the mountain and the weight measured down the mountain?</p>
<p>The reason is what physics tells us: "The farther away from the Earth's center, the less the gravitational pull; the closer to the Earth's center, the greater the gravitational pull." Less gravitational pull means things weigh less, more gravitational pull means things weigh more.</p>
<h3>Sunbathing</h3>
<p>— Bian Beichen</p>
<p>In the minds of most ordinary children, having a fair face and body is considered very beautiful. Therefore, the sun is almost the most terrible thing to them, so they rarely receive the sun's blessing.</p>
<p>However, humans are full of aesthetic sense, and a fair face and body is a kind of beauty. However, I always feel that Chinese beauty is morbid beauty, while foreign beauty is healthy beauty.</p>
<p>If you children feel that morbid beauty is shameful, then we might as well have a sunbath in addition to exercise every day, because it can make us healthy.</p>
<p>The best time for sunbathing is in the morning when the sun has just come out at five or six o'clock. The location can be on the terrace or indoors. If indoors, the windows must be opened to allow the sunlight to shine directly on the body without passing through glass, because there are three kinds of rays in sunlight: one is bright light, one is heat light, and the third is ultraviolet rays. Ultraviolet rays can kill germs and turn the skin a healthy brown. If it passes through glass, only bright light and heat light can enter, and ultraviolet rays will be blocked outside, so even sunbathing will be of no use.</p>
<p>Children! The title "Sick Man of East Asia" is a gift given to us by imperialism. I hope that you children can all take sunbaths to obtain healthy beauty and wash away this shameful name!</p>

<h3>Ways to Respect the National Flag</h3>
<p>— (Hansheng)</p>
<p>The national flag is the flag representing a country, that is, the flag representing the people of the whole country. All citizens should respect and love the national flag. These courtesies are what citizens should know. However, in China, where education is so uncommon, how many citizens know this common knowledge? Some people don't even know what kind of flag the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth is! Some people even use the national flag as a cloth awning to block the sun! Therefore, promoting this kind of common sense is very necessary at present!</p>
<p>If we want to promote something, we must put it into practice. Shouting slogans is useless! So if we want to respect the national flag, then we must respect the national flag according to the ways to respect the national flag:</p>
<p>(1) When saluting the national flag, you must be very solemn.</p>
<p>(2) When the national flag is raised and lowered, you must stand at attention and salute, and your eyes must be focused on the national flag. You must not look around or look away.</p>
<p>(3) No matter when, if we encounter someone destroying the national flag or insulting the national flag, we should treat them as enemies. (If that person is a young child or someone without knowledge, we should persuade them and explain to them the reasons for respecting the national flag.)</p>
<p>(4) Wherever we see a discarded national flag, we should pick it up. If it is old and torn, it should be burned immediately.</p>
<p>(5) When the national flag is damaged, it should not be patched, nor should it be used for other purposes. It is best to burn it with fire.</p>
<p>(6) When watching a movie or a play, when we see the national flag flying in it, we must stand up and salute.</p>
<p>(7) Those who intentionally insult the national flag, openly damage or remove it, or engage in insulting behavior shall be punished in accordance with the provisions of Article 167 of the Criminal Law.</p>
<p>(8) When walking, when we see someone raising or lowering the national flag, we should also stand still and pay our respects.</p>
<p>(9) When wearing a badge (or other items) with the national flag, it should not be below the abdomen. It is best to wear it on the left chest. If there are other badges, they should be attached below it.</p>
<p>(10) If we encounter someone hanging the national flag incorrectly, we should point it out to them.</p>
<p>The above are some ways we should respect the national flag. I hope that you children can all put them into practice, then you will truly be worthy of being good citizens!</p>
<h3>"Today" and "Tomorrow"</h3>
<p>— Bingying</p>
<p>I have a younger brother who is eleven years old this year. All he knows is how to play all day long, swinging on swings, bouncing balls, kicking shuttlecocks, and skipping ropes... he can do everything. After coming home, he drops his schoolbag and runs away, leaving his schoolwork behind. I said, "You should study! You must finish those math exercises 'today'!" But he replies with a smile, "'Tomorrow' I'll do them, I'll definitely do them 'tomorrow'!" "'Tomorrow,' 'tomorrow,'" my brother never finishes his homework, and as a result, he is punished by the teacher.</p>
<p>We should never think about the word "tomorrow." Whatever needs to be done should be finished "today," and not be delayed until "tomorrow!" Because "tomorrow" has "tomorrow's" things to do. If "today's" things are postponed until "tomorrow," it will interfere with "tomorrow's" things. Sometimes, we even use the word "tomorrow" to excuse ourselves and give reasons for procrastination. In fact, if we think about "tomorrow" when doing something, that thing will never be finished, and it will never be completed.</p>
<p>Successful people never think about "tomorrow," but those who fail often hope for "tomorrow." Children, if you want to be a successful person, you should seize "today" and not hope for "tomorrow"!</p>
<h3>How to Relieve (Disaster)</h3>
<p>— Dongsheng</p>
<h3>An Egg Can Be Suspended in Water</h3>
<p>— Jing'an</p>
<p>Children! This is a physics game that everyone can try. And it doesn't cost much. You'll gain an important principle of physics.</p>
<p>Now, prepare the necessary items, which are a fresh egg, a tall glass bottle filled with water, and a packet of salt.</p>
<p>First, put the egg into the bottle. The egg is heavier than water, so it will naturally sink to the bottom of the bottle. Now, slowly add salt to the water, little by little, stirring the water as you go. When the appropriate amount of salt has been added, the egg will completely obey your commands. You lift it up and place it in the center of the bottle. You can take your hand away, and it will still remain motionless. If you raise it a little higher or lower it a little, it will obey your commands and dare not move on its own.</p>
<p>The principle behind this phenomenon is very simple. Because the specific gravity of the egg is greater than that of fresh water, the egg sinks. Adding salt to the water turns the fresh water into salt water. The specific gravity of salt water is greater than that of fresh water. The more salt is added, the greater the specific gravity. When the specific gravity of the salt water is equal to the specific gravity of the egg, the egg will stop floating and sinking and remain suspended in the water. If you add more salt, making the specific gravity of the salt water greater than that of the egg, the egg will float to the surface of the water.</p>

<h3>On Vanity</h3>
<p>— Jiang Xue</p>
<p>Older people and those who are not old but have old-fashioned minds often lament that modern women are obsessed with vanity and see vanity as the gateway to depravity; at the same time, progressive people who are dedicated to the revolution often advise people to overcome vanity, to liberate themselves from vanity, believing that vanity is a trap.</p>
<p>These two types of people observe vanity from two different points of view, and their understanding of vanity is different. We must at least admit that "vanity" is a serious problem worthy of our investigation.</p>
<p>As for vanity, judging from the literal meaning, we can know that it roughly refers to people pursuing a kind of empty and unreal glory. For example, seeing Miss Zhang wearing such fashionable clothes, she quarrels with her mother to cut fabric, and at least wants to be as eye-catching as Miss Zhang, preferably surpassing her, this is vanity. Seeing Ruan Lingyu and Hu Die making movies for tens of thousands of people to watch, captivating tens of thousands of people, and then aspiring to enter the film industry, this is also vanity. From these places, vanity seems to be a kind of empty glory; but if we study carefully, we will come to the opposite conclusion. The vanity that people pursue is actually not "empty" at all; on the contrary, it is very practical. The so-called vanity is not metaphysical, but rather metaphysical.</p>
<p>Today's society is a society that occupies individual forms. It is a commodity production society. All the wealth of this society is the accumulation of commodities; even the works of "noble" artists and writers, the labor of people, and the physical appearance of women are commodified. The relationship between people is manifested through the relationship between commodities and commodities. Metal currency has become the "general equivalent" in economics, playing a kind of omnipotent, seemingly mysterious role in commodity society. People who are dazzled by the authority of general commodities and currency, "Everything for exchange" is their creed. To love dressing up, to love applying powder and rouge, is to commodify oneself and then add exquisite decoration; to hope to be famous, to like to be in the limelight, is to hope to display oneself as a commodity in a bustling marketplace. Only in this way can it be sold quickly and at a good price. Therefore, living in this society without a correct and clear understanding of this society, being obsessed with vanity is inevitable. The existence of this society inevitably leads to the existence of people who are obsessed with vanity.</p>
<p>In particular, it is said that women have the greatest vanity and that women believe in vanity the most. Some people even say that women are vain animals: but we rarely hear (at least comparatively less) such things said about men. When people talk about vanity, they associate it with women. What is the reason for this? Originally, today is a male-centered society, and women are appendages and slaves of men. Today's women are more blatantly commodified than men. Those women who stand in a weak position and do not know the position they are standing in take pleasing men as their purpose of survival and selling themselves as a profession. Society has given them easier conditions to be obsessed with vanity.</p>
<p>Therefore, today's women want to be rescued from the three iron chains of economic subordination and male subordination. It is absolutely necessary to recognize this society, recognize this environment, recognize one's own position in this society, and completely end one's own vanity. Vanity is a trap. It cannot save us in the slightest. It only sends us further into hell, making us more and more subordinate and enslaved! However, we must answer those old antiques and new antiques who are full of worldly morality with an awakened iron fist. We are not difficult to know their ghostly intentions: The purpose of their scolding women for vanity is to call women, who are one of their targets for exploitation and oppression, to receive the least reward from them, even though their loot is so huge that it is shocking. At the same time, they want to call us women to be responsible for their greed and sins. (Newspapers often see alarming figures for the import of cosmetics, and those people burst into curses, as if China's weakness is entirely due to the luxury and vanity of women.)</p>
<p>We must overcome vanity for our own future.</p>
<h3>Drum Singer</h3>
<p>— Zigang</p>
<p>丨Travel Notes丨</p>
<p>Every day, I ride out on my bike according to the time, and I don't come back according to the time, because coming back is lonely, guarding the cabin in a daze.</p>
<p>Almost as a rule, whenever I pass the low earthen wall of the neighborhood, I always like to tilt my head and take a look at the small bolt that is open. And as long as it is morning, what I will never miss seeing is a sixteen or seventeen-year-old girl with braided hair, often wearing a black padded jacket and pants, sweeping the yard or washing clothes. The crooked window frames of the house have taken on a yellowish-brown color due to age, and the withered jasmine on the ground quietly only has green leaves left. But when the lights come on, I can't find this girl who is busy all day long, and there is always a yellow, rusty lock on the knocker.</p>
<p>"Where did she go?" I asked myself curiously.</p>
<p>It wasn't until the Mid-Autumn Festival that I rode around inside and outside the city alone and came back. I unconsciously got close to midnight, and I knocked hard on the door of the apartment, waiting. Coincidentally, that girl walked over from the alley, followed by an old man with a stringed instrument in his hand. The same eyebrows and bridge of the nose told me that they were father and daughter. The girl changed into a purple coat today. In this small alley at night, there were only the three of us, silently exchanging glances. There was no need for my bike light, the moon was strangely clear. When the old man clumsily unlocked the lock, the girl seemed to be familiar with me:</p>
<p>"Just coming back? Do you always come back at this time every day?"</p>
<p>"No, today I took advantage of the good moon to run more errands. Is business good?" I saw the drum and clapper in her hand and knew that this was a singing girl who sold her songs on the streets every night.</p>
<p>"It's a little better today, it's much worse on weekdays, and there are times when I come back empty-handed." She looked at the old man staggering in and pointed at the back: "This is my dad. Half of his eyes are blind. He always has to rest more during the day and gropes to go out with me once at night. It's not easy to make a living by this."</p>
<p>I was surprised by the girl's frankness, examining her pair of small, delicate but bright eyes. The sunlight clearly illuminated the few freckles on her forehead. Her forehead was still covered with a row of extremely short bangs. I remembered that most of the drum singers in Beiping liked to have long braids. Without thinking, I asked:</p>
<p>"Why don't you go to Qingyun Pavilion or other amusement parks? You can earn more money..."</p>
<p>Before she could reply to me, she said, "See you tomorrow," and only mentioned when closing the door:</p>
<p>"I haven't made the bed and lit the lamp for my dad yet."</p>
<p>Knocking on the door ring a second time, the sleepy eyes of the doorman were fixed on me.</p>
<p>When I passed those two small doors early the next morning, I was invited in. The old man was lying on the bed in the inner room, coughing lightly. That girl's bunk was set up in that only outer room, facing a stiff portrait. I asked:</p>
<p>"Is that your mother?"</p>
<p>The girl wiped the long bench and felt at ease as I looked here and there:</p>
<p>"Yes, she died eleven years ago. My mom was much prettier than the one above. She used to be a very, very popular drum singer, but she got sick..."</p>
<p>She motioned for me to walk into the yard, because the old man didn't like to mention the old things. She told me about her dad's stubbornness, not letting her put on makeup and sell her art in the drum garden, preferring that the two of them wander the alleys and live a hard life every day, rubbing their waists and legs when they got home.</p>
<p>Coming out of the small yard, I gently chanted in my heart: "Ah! Jasmine without flowers!"</p>
<p>Just two days ago, the doorman told me that the old man used to be a secretary. Once, an eye disease broke this rice bowl, and the woman left a message before she died, saying that she asked her daughter to add some effort to the songs she had already learned, and she could also support her half-blind father.</p>
<p>However, the old man was stubborn and unwilling to let his daughter go down the old road her mother took to grind herself, only in the dim and deep night, lightly plucking the strings in the alley, quietly listening for calls. He was familiar with the double betrayal of the drum singer's encounter.</p>
<p>Whenever I read under the lamp at night, hearing the sounds of strings and drums nearby or far away, or the bright and melodious singing, in addition to feeling that this is a kind of northern atmosphere, I always seem to see that simple girl suppressing her tears and confiding to the audience, analyzing the ambitions and struggles of life. What she sings is "Great Stories," and there is no shortage of chivalry, loyalty, and filial piety.</p>
<h3>Women of Southern Fujian's Hui'an</h3>
<p>— Yu Yuan</p>
<p>In the rural villages of Southern Fujian, seeing robust young women dragging wooden clogs, with large braids down their backs, walking "clitter-clatter" on the village paths in the fields, or seeing women with red, high-soled small feet moving along with a faltering gait, seems to be an everyday occurrence. Although there are only a few modern women who have lost their braids on their heads, have long eyebrows painted on their faces, and are wearing rouge, this has nothing to do with the lives of the entire Southern Fujianese women, and they still maintain a kind of dependent, spatial, and conservative disposition. The women of the rural villages of Southern Fujian live contentedly and leisurely under a tradition that has been passed down for generations. Therefore, very few of them seek knowledge, and most of them only hope to marry a "yang ke" (i.e., overseas Chinese. In Southern Fujian, many go to Southeast Asia to do business or work, and some entire villages have even been to Southeast Asia) or a soldier with a slightly higher status. Married women usually only cook, wash clothes, and take care of their children. They do not help their husbands with various tasks during the busy silkworm season or autumn harvest, as do women in rural villages in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. If the husband is in Southeast Asia, they only wait for the remittances and spend some time indulging in flower shows, playing cards, and other improper entertainment.</p>
<p>However, although both are within the realm of Southern Fujian, the women of Hui'an are special. The lives and characteristics of Hui'an women are excellent material for women's issues. Perhaps they are also one of the groups of lowly women in China most subjected to social criticism!</p>
<p>Hui'an, this place is a peculiar county in China, especially in Southern Fujian. Most of the men cannot make a living locally and go to various counties in Southern Fujian to work. Because Hui'an is close to the sea, it has neither a large amount of farmland nor factories. Therefore, the economy cannot be built on agriculture in general; nor can it be built on the small-scale commerce and industry of the county seat. The lives of Hui'an people in various counties in Southern Fujian are exactly the same as the lives of people from northern Jiangsu in various counties in southern Jiangsu. They do the hardest and lowest jobs, and are busy all year round. Masons, carpenters, rickshaw pullers, even barbers and peddlers, these occupations are the unique domain of Hui'an. In this situation, Hui'an men naturally cannot talk about bringing money home, so the women left in the villages of Hui'an replace their husbands, fathers, and brothers, doing all the hard labor: cultivating the limited farmland; catching fish in the muddy waters by the sea, barefoot with disheveled hair; carrying heavy burdens of one or two hundred catties from one place to another; carrying various things to the city to sell on the streets; their lives are spent in such hard labor, and they do not pay attention to decoration, nor do they like to wear red like ordinary Southern Fujian women. They only wear coarse black homespun cloth that harmonizes with their purplish-red rough skin, and comb their hair into a ridiculously large bun, sometimes wrapped in cloth. That appearance seems to be about the same as what can be seen in the shacks of Jiangbei in Shanghai. However, the suffering of Hui'an women is indeed greater than that of Jiangbei women. Because its so-called peculiarity lies not only in the hard labor of women's lives; but is manifested in the relationship between husband and wife. Marriage, for Hui'an women, is indeed a mysterious and too cruel thing. The marriage of a Hui'an woman is simply like a children's game or something unexpected in a legend. After the marriage ceremony is held, she can actually only be a bride for three to five days before being forced to return to her parents' home. Only after giving birth in her parents' home is she allowed to return to live permanently with her husband. If she does not give birth after returning to her parents' home, the local etiquette will not allow her to go to her husband's home again. Even if she goes to visit during the holidays, she cannot stay for a few days. Otherwise, she will be subject to the contempt of etiquette and the attack of public opinion. Moreover, most of the men in the villages are in other counties, and there are very few opportunities to return home. Therefore, under another kind of circumstance, Hui'an women are again destined by fate to be living corpses of sexuality. They are thus permanently captured and driven under the dual oppression of economics and sexuality.</p>
<p>In recent years, the suicide of Hui'an women has become a terrifying statistic. It is said that the suicide of Hui'an women is due to sexual relations and the increasingly panic-stricken lives after the bankruptcy of the rural economy. This seems to be close to the truth. Hui'an women, especially young women, often agree with several others to carry ropes to commit suicide by jumping into wells, jumping into the sea, or jumping into rivers, which has become something that happens several times a year. And in Hui'an, it seems to have become commonplace.</p>
<p>Hui'an women are unfortunate under the cruel old society, but in fact, it is not limited to Hui'an alone. In the remote and dilapidated rural villages and remote mountains of China, there are many women living a miserable life like in legends! However, the liberation movement that the young ladies of this era are singing loudly is still only creating status for these few special higher-class women, and ignoring the countless rural women living under feudal etiquette.</p>
<h3>The Work of Modern Soviet Women</h3>
<p>— Translated by Xue Jihui</p>
<p>by Miss M.E. Walker (Contemporary Rev, August Issue)</p>
<p>The liberation of modern Soviet women, theoretically speaking, seems to be very easy, but in reality, only the situations in cities such as Moscow and Leningrad are in line with the theory. In more distant areas such as Georgia (Ceorgea) and the Urals (Urals), not only men, but even women themselves, did not dare to openly admit at first that women were more valuable than livestock or any tradable item in the family.</p>
<p>When the Soviet Union announced to the world that Soviet women (from Vladivostok on the Pacific coast to Durna in the west) would henceforth be absolutely equal to male citizens, and that whether in private life or social life, before the law, they were all "workers," before the ink on the official documents was completely dry, the women in the major cities of the political center rose up to take on their due responsibilities. The nature of Russian women is endowed with a very strong ability to discern and affirm the true meaning of things; therefore, at the beginning, there was no misconception that "equality is irresponsible freedom." Their mistake was only that they allowed work and responsibility to dominate their lives too much.</p>
<p>For thousands of years, Soviet women have always been forced to suppress their nature of self-expression and independent ability. Once this liberation, which they had not made much effort to accept and did not expect, came, their long-hidden talents and abilities were stimulated by the sympathetic and harmonious tone of women's liberation. This produced an almost unbelievable ability for work and administration, an ability that surprised not only the women themselves, but also their former masters.</p>
<p>The women we have always admired, such as Brehle Brechkcllelly 丨丨 the grandmother of the Soviet revolution, those cursed by modern Soviet Russia 丨丨 and her friends who were exiled and wandered around before the war, we used to regard them as extraordinary figures in Russia, not ordinary citizens. But compared with the modern Soviet women, it undoubtedly proves that they are just common examples. In the daily life of the countryside, modern Soviet women are responsible for improving everything. No matter how deep-rooted prejudices are, if one thinks that there is no dull daily life in the Soviet Union, that is the same mistake as thinking that there is no ray of light in the dim and bleak sky of the entire Soviet Union. In 丨丨 the Soviet Union, people have to work to live. Wherever there is work, you will definitely see working women. I think there will be no shortage of work, although some are completely experimental in nature, some have been carried out according to the latest European methods, such as installing electricity to turn all villages and cities into bright lights, and some are still carried out under the conditions of the terrible Ivan era.</p>
<p>The first time I came into contact with these new women was in the Soviet consulate of a certain foreign country, where I went to get my passport visa. Half of the staff there were women, and their work efficiency was the same as that of the other two consulates that only had male staff. While the male staff were trapped in my countless questions, the appropriate answers came from the mouth of one of those short-haired, simply dressed women who smoked cigarettes every day. In fact, they were managing the consulate. When I walked into that office, I originally thought I would have to wait a long time to get a visa, and I planned to use a little bribe, if needed. But I found that since the women's community entered the office, Russia's office efficiency has increased a lot, and my money is safer in my pocket than in my hand. Later, I slowly observed in detail and learned that the root of this illegal fraud had been eradicated by a labor team, and this labor team was all women. Their only goal is to eradicate this social evil.</p>
<p>In another consulate, I heard that women can also compete for the position of diplomat, if their qualifications are the same as or better than those of the male candidates. An old diplomat from before the war talked to me about how women have shown how capable they are in international affairs; he did not hide that their work is the same as that of men; in some cases, their speed and intuition may be faster and more precise.</p>
<p>Like other emerging countries in Europe, Russia also had a period in the early stages of women's liberation when educated women were willing to participate in any position, regardless of whether those positions were suitable for their abilities. They have tried to engage in slaughtering, construction, engineering, theater management, in short, everything outside the home. Soon after, women leaders discovered that there are some careers in the world that are only suitable for women, and men are not suitable or simply useless for these kinds of work. So after a period of storm and stress, they guided this great force of new labor to the path they are now taking, engaging in improving the physique, morality, and intelligence of young people and women. Those women with superhuman talents can sell their labor at a higher value in the labor market without relying on favoritism and competing with men. They still occupy various positions, such as factory managers, newspaper editors, financial officers in government agencies, and heads of education and social affairs. I remember a female stationmaster, she was really an extraordinary woman, she did things that ordinary Russian men could not do, she could make a team of transport workers automatically do a good day's work without supervision; her will was as firm and unyielding as the slopes of Mont Blanc (Monr Blane). (To be continued)</p>
<p>World Famous Women</p>
<h3>Mary Austin</h3>
<p>— Yang Yu</p>
<p>American female writer, Mary Austin, was born in 1870 and died on August 13th of this year in Santa Fe at the age of sixty-five. She is a female writer of modern America, and the success of her theories and skills not only made her a famous writer of this era, but also a great new figure in the American women's world.</p>
<p>In her autobiography, Earth Horizon, as well as other works, are filled with an atmosphere of sincerity and integrity. She was a sick child abandoned by an officer, but later became a farmer and a proponent of feminism. She suffered from a lack of family affection, she lacked love, so she replaced love with justice for herself and for others. Her many years of history and marital encounters can be said to be a tragic drama in the world, but from this environment, she has become a surprising figure in modern times. Austin's personality and simple demeanor are like a queen without a crown, sometimes seemingly stern and stubborn, so although her life history is imprinted with many struggles, her ambition and spirit have given her great success.</p>
<p>These scars are clearly revealed in her writings and life. Her genius was fully expressed in "The Land of Little Rain," which she wrote after her marriage, which is the most outstanding in her poetry and drama. She spent sixteen years in the California desert, working like an Indian woman, studying Indian knowledge and the characteristics of the desert. The results of the research were published, and the realism of the content of Land of Sun is amazing. It has precise botanical knowledge and observation, as well as the direct relationship between humans and the natural environment.</p>
<p>Austin looked down on maternal instincts and enthusiastically made herself a famous naturalist, anthropologist, and also a seasoned and experienced literary writer. Her later works have even deeper implications. Her heart has never retreated, and she always embraces the spirit of invention and overcoming. Some people doubt the truth she discovered, but they have never doubted her entire soul. Her intellect is intelligent and sound, rather than being biased towards emotions or narrow-mindedness.</p>
<p>She pays deep and frank attention to art and life, as well as to the people in general. A few years ago, she submitted an anonymous "autobiography" to a publication called "The Nation." In that article, she called herself "Woman Alone." The meaning of loneliness is real and sad. Her sincere work filled her life; she gave love to people, and many Indians also returned her love; because she has been fighting for the Indians all her life.</p>
<h3>Posture of the New Woman</h3>
<p>— Sudan</p>
<p>Since civilization bestowed enlightened knowledge upon women, new women have appeared anytime, anywhere, with the colors of their times and the basic tones of their environment, presenting various postures that enter people's ears and eyes, giving people special attention, praise, or criticism, and giving society a positive and progressive influence.</p>
<p>During the Great Revolution of China in 1926, new women emerged like bamboo shoots after a rain, which proves that the emergence of new women is advancing along with social liberation.</p>
<p>After the iron chains of imperialism were put on the neck of the Chinese revolution, all forward-thinking and spirited women were cruelly massacred and devastated. The fierce and dark magic hands then pulled them back, creating a history of the setback of women's rights in recent years.</p>
<p>During these few years of setbacks for women, poor women suffered more and more, their lives were trapped in the mire, either enduring the intensified exploitation of capitalists, or suffering the pain of rural bankruptcy and displacement. Rich women put more effort into licentiousness and luxury. The upper class lived like worms, jumped like birds. In addition to self-cultivation, having fun, and enjoying themselves, they ignored everything and knew nothing, almost not knowing that they were human beings, because they simply did not need to be good people; the lower class relied on selling their bodies and selling their souls for a living. Similarly, the men they parasitized also relied on selling their personality, soul, and national interests, so that the Chinese national spirit was greatly bankrupted, and the aggression of imperialism advanced more and more, and the four northeastern provinces were given to Japan.</p>
<p>During this period, enlightened women who hated the loss of power and territory and the crisis of the nation, who had appeared as new women, although there were in all aspects, in fact, were all suffering, appearing like stars and then disappearing.</p>
<p>The death knell of the annihilation of women's rights accompanied by the fall of the country is not enough to awaken the illusions of the general public; recently, it has even followed the urgent attack of imperialism on dividing China. The women who are being pressed under the bluestone slabs have been stirred up by the same fierce waves as the widespread drought, flood, and war disasters in China this year, intensifying the oppression on our women day by day. There is a great aura of seeing women as monsters, forming this year, a year of disaster for women! Our numb women are also as docile as sheep, bearing these oppressions and not daring to resist; or still indulging in a drunken dream, sinking into depravity. This is a great crisis for women!</p>
<p>Since the Guangdong side publicized the warning sign of prohibiting male and female students from studying and walking together; followed by the prohibition of men and women from eating and living together, the prohibition of showing movies jointly performed by men and women, and the removal of women from positions in various agencies: followed by scolding women's bare legs and feet..., the purpose of these is nothing more than to cruelly place the women's groups who are raising their heads under the oppression of the enslavement system. Therefore, it is necessary to pulverize women's upward-looking independence, especially to deprive women of their status, on the one hand, to call them back to the family, to give up their status to men, in order to slightly alleviate the panic of massive unemployment; on the other hand, to call women back to the squeezing machine, and even back to the three obediences and four virtues, continuously belonging to men, belonging to the pressure of淫威,輾轉屈服 in the shackles of double slaves, preparing to be docile slaves of the conquered country.</p>
<p>Not only that, but also: restoring the old ways: ah, promoting religion, ah,... ah, those old tricks gradually froze like waves and tides in front of the increasingly dying Chinese nation. What do these also illustrate?</p>
<p>Obviously, it is imperialism that wants to completely colonize China. In addition to looting through the behavior of bandits, they more cleverly use,借刀殺人: this vicious means. Therefore, imperialism and its ××者,恊力 cultivate China's feudal forces, causing the Chinese people to fall back into the ancient swamp 丨丨 feudal mist, using this to confuse the people, deceive the people, and numb the people, teaching the people to be numb and indifferent, and no longer know what liberation and freedom are, and cultivating the mentality of preparing to be slaves of the conquered country. From this, the Chinese people only know how to offer their life's blood and sweat to satisfy them. This is the poisonous attack of imperialism on the cultural policy of the colony!</p>
<p>The deeper and sharper this poisonous attack is, does China still want new women to emerge? Even if new women's postures are shown, what will they be allowed to do at that time? I am afraid that only "three divorces of his wife, only women and villains are difficult to raise," those sage's ways will be the most universal and popular high-sounding words at that time.</p>
<p>From this, it can be imagined that the crisis of Chinese women is deepening and becoming more serious day by day. The crisis of Chinese women, like the national crisis, is already imminent! How can we enlightened women sit idly by and watch this crisis that is becoming more serious day by day without thinking of ways to save it? We cannot sit back and do nothing! My fire is burning, my blood is singing, my heart is beating, my spirit is praying silently, I pray silently before the women of China who have not yet awakened: 丨丨 Sisters, wake up! Turn incompetence and weakness into a brave posture; turn decadence and depravity into keen ability; turn ease and laziness into self-improving struggle; turn the character of scattered sand into the heat of uniting the group; turn jealousy and small quantities into invincible ambition; turn vanity and luxury into armed spirit; turn the servility of relying on people into an independent protagonist!... Use the power of our women's masses to liberate the crisis of women and save China from ruin! I hope that you will all become such new women, appearing in the posture of new women who liberate the national pain, so that this posture spreads all over China, more than the butterflies flying in spring. Amen! (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Finance Foreign Banks Raise Prices, Gold Price Rises Again by Three Yuan</h3>
<p>November Deadline Nears</p>
<p>Public Sentiment Thrives, Officialdom Still Strong</p>
<p>The gold market has been stable for several days. The November futures settlement is approaching, and the number of contracts remains crowded, causing short sellers to show signs of panic from time to time. As a result, market prices tend to rise easily but fall with difficulty. Yesterday's market result showed another increase in half a day. The situation was vaguely struggling in the middle of the day, but sellers ultimately lacked strength, and the overall trend remained firm. In the morning, overseas silver markets saw slight increases in both the UK and the US, while London spot gold fell by three pence. Exchange rates were relatively stable, and US prices had rebounded slightly, with stocks rising slightly. Reports indicated that US banking circles deeply believe the restoration of the gold standard is not far off. News agencies such as the Associated Press telegraphed that the US Treasury Department stated it would continue its silver purchase policy in China but denied large-scale purchases. Public sentiment was extremely uncertain. In off-exchange pre-trading, the initial price was 31 yuan, but unexpectedly, buying interest remained strong, pushing the price higher. Although short sellers were squeezed out by more than ten numbers, the number of contracts decreased only slightly, indicating the buyers' strength. As a result, sellers dared not act rashly. After the opening, banks' appetite was blocked, and with the exchange rate trending stronger, the Dalian gang tried their best to arbitrage in the market, resulting in oversupply domestically and a decline in prices. However, the price did not break the 30 yuan mark, and public sentiment remained stable, with many people taking the opportunity to maintain their positions at lower prices. After the low, the price entered a consolidation phase, but there were many rebounds in the middle. The exchange rate was also supported by Chinese merchants, returning to stability. Afterwards, the gold market gradually became more stable. Although there was much consolidation in the middle, the underlying trend was easier to rise than to fall. Moreover, due to the Sunday holiday, demand naturally exceeded supply in the market, and large investors had strong buying intentions. The situation was most buoyant at noon. December futures followed the November futures in their advances and retreats, with both sides actively trading. The November price was six to seven jiao higher than the December price, similar to a swap. It is observed that many November bulls recently, such as the Dalian gang, have successively rolled over to December, but the difference is less than one yuan. Moreover, the old standard settlement price is higher than the new standard. The amount of the Dalian gang is not significant, and whether other buyers are willing to roll over to December futures is still a question. The total number of contracts remains at 28,000 to 29,000, so the short sellers are naturally anxious. How overseas silver markets will fare is no longer a concern; everything depends on whether the bulls release their positions. The trend of the gold market seems to be thriving. The market situation for half a day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 934.2 yuan, an increase of 1.4 yuan from the previous close. The morning opening exchange rate for spot selling prices was 1 shilling 5.5 pence for British currency and 35.875 yuan for US currency. Yifengyong and others advanced to 5.5 yuan, while Zhengjin blocked 12-month US dollars at 9375. Shenkang Hengyu, Dalian Gang Yuan Maoyong, said it was still worth 3.5 yuan, while Yuankangxiang and others continued to advance, rising to 5 yuan. Banks were eager to sell, and blocked 12-month US dollars at 36 yuan. Dadecheng Hengyu Hongli Yuankangxiang Yuanheng sold out, falling to 0.05 yuan. Fuxingyong Fuyu took advantage of the low to place orders, rising to around 2 yuan. Dadecheng Yuanxing Fu'an Daxingyong still sold out, retreating to within 1 yuan. Afterwards, it was learned that HSBC's listing was unchanged, and public sentiment was stable. Hengyu Fuxingyong Yongfeng Zhaofengchang Yuanxing Richang and others successively placed orders, rising to 2.4 yuan. Dadecheng Yicheng sold orders and then retreated to 1 yuan. After entering, public sentiment was stable, struggling around 2 yuan. Hengyu Fu'an placed orders, once rising to 3.1 yuan. Hengxing Yuqing Yongrui Kang Daxingyong Fuchang sold out and then retreated to 1.6 yuan. Dadecheng Yuan Maoyong Shenkang Yuanchang Yong Yuanxing Yongrui Kang and others placed orders together, gradually rising to 4.5 yuan. Qingyu Yong sold out, retreating to 2.8 yuan. Dadecheng Fuxingyong Hengyu continued to advance, rising to 4 yuan. Fuchang still sold out, retreating to 2.7 yuan. Fuxingyong Shunmao Hengyu Fuyu Yuan Maoyong Hongli Huixiang Qianchang Xiang and others continuously bought in. Although Zhaofengchang Hengxing Yifengyong sold, the price gradually rose to 5.8 yuan due to the bullish sentiment. The noon closing was 935.8 yuan. After the closing, Qianchangxiang Dafa Yong Yuan Maoyong Ruikang and others placed orders, while Shengda Yuqing Yong sold orders, struggling around 6 yuan. It was found that the highest price in half a day was 935.8 yuan, and the lowest price was 930.5 yuan, a fluctuation of 5.3 yuan. As a result, the price rose again by 3 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The morning opening for the December futures new standard was 934.2 yuan, an increase of 1.4 yuan from the previous close. There were many rollover transactions in the market. Yuanshengyong Fuyu and others traded over 400 contracts with Wanxing, with a difference of about 0.6 to 0.7 jiao, with the November futures being higher. After entering, the market situation was mediocre. Extending to the noon closing, it was also listed at 935.8 yuan, also an increase of 3 yuan from the previous close.</p>
<p>The settlement price, due to HSBC Bank's US dollar listing being unchanged, was 35.6875 yuan, corresponding to a standard gold price of 669 yuan and zero. According to the closing price, it was about 34 yuan, a decrease of less than 3 yuan from the previous close. The new standard for December futures, due to the Central Bank's standard gold price listing rising to 965.9 yuan, corresponded to about 30 yuan according to the closing price, a decrease of more than 1 yuan from the previous close. The registration price for this month is 936 yuan, the same as November, and the same as December. The morning water supplement was 936 yuan, and the price of pure gold was still increased by 10 yuan, listed at 944.2 yuan. The Tianjin gang advanced slightly, and the spot numbers did not have much selling interest. Only Yingfengheng sold 1,050 taels to the Tianjin gang, increased by 13 yuan, for delivery in three weeks. Due to interest rate differences, the water increase was high. After entering, the gold market rose, and although the spot numbers had selling interest, the buying price was already low, and there were no more transactions. There were few remaining October public bonds, and buyers were even more inactive.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was flat. In summary, Wanxing Shunli Hongkang Yong Fuchang Yicheng Fuyu Yuqingyong Shengsheng Da Daxingyong Shenkang and others were sellers, while Dadecheng Yongde Yuan Maoyong Shunmao Hengyu Zhengchang Huixiang Dingchang Risheng Yongxiang He Tianfeng Hengchang Yong Hengtai Futai Ting Fu'an Fuxingyong Ren Fayong Qianchang Xiang Ruikang and others were buyers. Ruikang Dadecheng Hongli Shenkang first went out and then came in, while Zhaofengchang Dafa Yong's entry and exit were quite erratic. The Dalian gang and Wanxing traded a total of over 1,000 contracts, squeezing out over 600. In addition, there were many who sold November futures and bought December futures. Shunli traded a total of around 700 contracts, squeezing out over 300 contracts. The Guang gang Hengxing had an oversupply, but it was very scattered. Shengsheng sold about 200 contracts. In summary, Dadecheng and Hengyu were the most active buyers on the day, both with over 1,000 contracts. Fuchang was the most active seller, selling a total of over 1,200 contracts. The total number of transactions on the day was 44,142 contracts.</p>
<p>October contracts are nearing completion, with only 49 contracts remaining. The buyers are Fuchang, Yuanyi, and Dadecheng, while the sellers are Tongyi Yongfeng Dingtai and Yingfengheng.</p>
<p>The November lineup is mostly bullish: Dadecheng with over 3,400 contracts, Yuanyi with over 2,300, Shunli with over 1,800, Wanxing with over 1,500, Hengxing with over 1,200, Yongli with 1,110, Dachangxiang with over 1,000, Shengsheng with over 900, Yifengyong Runchang Yushen Yu Qiafengyong with over 700 each, Yuanhengchang Shengyong Yuan Maoyong with over 600 each, Tongfengheng Daxingyong with over 500 each, Hongkangyong Hongxingyong Dashun Yuanshengyong Yiyu Runchangyong with over 400 each, Chunyuanyong Fuchang Lichang Dingfeng Lifeng with over 300 each.

The amount of transactions borrowed in silver dollars was 9,600 yuan, equivalent to 30,720 strings of wen.</p>
<h3>Securities Bond Market Stabilizes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sentiment in the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange market was relatively stable. Although rumors were prevalent, they were mostly speculative. Short sellers were mostly foreign firms, as they had more timely access to information. They had an advantage in obtaining information, but there were both successes and failures. In terms of trends, there was still a struggle. In terms of sentiment, it was not easy to be optimistic for the time being. The environment was unstable, and the number of contracts was crowded. There would still be many changes before the Fifth Plenary Session. Yesterday, due to the high volume of transactions, one session was reduced in the afternoon, with only three sessions conducted. The situation was low and recovered, with some consolidation. The first session saw a consistent downward trend. No. 38 sold out personnel reduction bonds, plunging by 0.6 to 0.7 jiao, and the rest also fell by 0.3 to 0.5 jiao. After entering, the declines became smaller and smaller.

The total transaction volume was 18,060,000 yuan. The transaction price of the stock of this exchange, which had not been opened for a long time, was 73 yuan.

<h3>US Recovery Policy Changes, New York Stocks Rebound Strongly</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company Report: Yesterday (5th), New York stocks rebounded strongly because the chairman of the Design Committee of the Recovery Agency, Li Zhibo, claimed that the agency's recovery policy would reduce price-setting and production regulations. The situation leveled off slightly at the end. Bonds rose due to rising off-exchange market conditions, and the market situation was also strong. Speculators in the small exchange believed that the recent market had fallen too low, and pessimistic psychology was eliminated, improving sentiment. Chicago wheat rose due to continued large transactions in flour. The total daily transaction volume was 870,000 shares.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Shows Slight Stability</h3>
<p>Japanese Companies Issue Near and Enter Far</p>
<p>Market Sentiment Slightly Better</p>
<p>National Day Yarn Exchange Closed</p>
<p>The yarn market is calm, showing a slightly stable state after a major drop. Most people believe that the price level is already low, and there is a temporary intention to go long. As a result, market sentiment is slightly firm. However, Japanese companies are replenishing the near month and releasing the far month, making swap transactions. It is observed that market sentiment is expected to rebound by one or two yuan. However, the selling price of 20-count yarn is cheaper than standard yarn, and there are few buyers. The yarn exchange will be closed for one day on Double Tenth Festival.</p>
<p>(Golden Rooster Good Two or Three Jiao) In the opening market for standard yarn, US cotton rose by several pounds, and it was predicted that the trend would still be soft, and transactions in the market were quite light. However, most people waited for a rebound of one or two yuan before making business plans, so the ups and downs were minimal. Each month rose slightly by 0.1, 0.2, or 0.3 jiao. In the afternoon, Japanese companies entered the near month and exited the far month, making swap transactions. The market situation remained flat. Because the sales of 20-count yarn are very sluggish, and although the selling price is cheap, there are still few outlets, the spot price of yarn is lower than the standard price, so the upward momentum is still difficult. Each month also rose by 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, or 0.5 jiao. The total daily transaction volume was 31,700 bales. It was found that Tongji sold 600 bales, Hengyi 2,050 bales, Junchang 1,650 bales, Xiesheng 850 bales, Chong'an 550 bales, Tonghe 300 bales, Dachang 1,100 bales, and Mingde 600 bales. Yicheng bought 450 bales, Jifeng 550 bales, Tongji 650 bales, Dafeng 2,200 bales, Shenchang 500 bales, Yantai 950 bales, Runkang 1,200 bales, and Xiesheng 1,350 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for one day are listed below.</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Compared to Previous Day Existing Inventory</p>
<p>October 169.4 168.9 169.4 Up 0.20 39,850</p>

<h3>Chinese and Foreign Cotton Markets Diverge</h3>
<p>US and India Rebound, Zheng Standard is Tired</p>
<p>Japanese Traders Have Rumors of Deliveries</p>
<p>The cotton market is again flat and tired because the price ratio with yarn is too high, and factories are unable to purchase. As a result, there are few spot transactions. There are rumors that Japanese traders have to deliver more than 20,000 dan in October. As a result, the market was fluctuating and loosening in the afternoon. Another rumor is that a certain speculator will close long positions in October, and the situation is very flat.</p>
<p>(October Cotton Long Positions Closed) The standard cotton market opened, and foreign cotton rose by several pounds. However, the market sellers were not strong. Only the long positions in October were closed, and the market trend was loose. As a result, each month fell by 0.05 to 0.1 jiao. In the afternoon, it was heard that foreign traders had deliveries, and the market situation weakened. Each month fell again by 0.05 to 0.15 jiao. The total daily transaction volume was 94,600 dan. It was found that Yuanxingchang sold 4,000 dan, Yifeng 1,700 dan, Shenji 2,900 dan, Taixing 1,300 dan, Dafu 3,200 dan, Jifeng 3,200 dan, Tongji 2,200 dan, Jinchang 1,200 dan, Changhe 2,700 dan, and Xiesheng 3,600 dan.

<h3>Grains: One Shipment of Foreign Barley Transacted; Wheat Futures Rise and Then Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, when the flour market opened in the morning, it continued the upward momentum from the previous day. Market sentiment was very good, and foreign barley futures were reported to have risen 35 jiao. Both spot and futures flour were being bought by merchants, so prices rose across the board, varying by 1 to 2 fen. Although factories were selling short, short covering and new hoarding purchases kept the market relatively stable. In the afternoon, one shipment of foreign barley was transacted, handled by Fuxin, at a price of 4.62 yuan, 5 fen less than the previous transaction. After this news spread, Fuxin and others immediately sold off in large quantities, causing the price to suddenly drop by 3 to 4 fen. It then fluctuated again, but ultimately weakened. The closing prices were down 1.75 fen for the current month, 2.25 fen for November, 3.5 fen for December, 3.25 fen for January, and 2.25 fen for February.</p>
<p>Yesterday in the wheat market, foreign barley futures rose 3 to 5 jiao. Market sentiment was very good in the morning, and both near and far term prices rose by 1 to 2 fen. After the news of the foreign barley transaction spread at noon, the market underwent a dramatic change. Long positions were closed out and new short positions were opened, with strong competition. Foreign barley was purchased by Fuxin at a price of only 4.62 yuan, which was 5 fen less than the previous day. In the afternoon, under the competitive selling of cotton and wheat by various parties, prices fell by 1 jiao. The closing prices were 9 fen lower than the previous day's closing prices for both this month and January, and 8 fen lower for the remaining months. Major factories have been holding firm on spot wheat for a long time, and even small factories did not show interest yesterday, it is said.</p>

<h3>North and South Rice Markets Move in Opposite Directions</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, the sources of supply from various merchant groups were scarce due to continuous rainy weather, as newly harvested rice grains had not been sun-dried and were soft and damp, making it difficult to mill polished rice. Only the No. 11 and 12 grades (totaling nearly 2,000 shi) managed to shake off the sluggishness of the past half-month and gradually show an upward trend. With sellers raising their prices, the local market became more active. Furthermore, merchants from Qingdao and Yantai were also buying nearly 200 bags of "Yaocheng Baige" and around 200 bags of slightly broken rice from the kilns. As a result, the situation tightened, and the prices of all grades of rice rose. The prices of "Yaocheng Baige" and other varieties have all rebounded by 2 jiao, and the prices of "Xin Duyangjian" have also increased by 2 chi. Only the supply of "Hou Xin Geng" was relatively abundant, showing a slight tightening of only a few jiao. Given this situation, it seems unlikely that new rice will flood the market within a day or two, and on the other hand, store sales are proceeding smoothly with the decline in polishing orders and the acceptance of new rice. This may lead to a temporary imbalance in supply and demand, which will inevitably lead to firmer prices. If this is the case, there may be hope for the new rice in the market. As for the various grades of broken rice, although there is some activity in the bag trading, the orders are scarce due to the seasonal decline, so the overall situation is difficult to improve. The situation remains mixed, and the prices are still uneven. The direction of change remains sluggish, and the situation with "Xin Yinyuan" is also largely the same.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, thirty ships arrived from various routes along the river. The weather was sunny, but the overall market sales were very slow. Except for the higher grades of "Xi Xin Geng Ding Zhong Ci," which saw a small price increase of a few jiao, the price of broken rice decreased by 1-2 jiao. There was only slight interest in "Bian Yuan," and the price was also slightly lower. The prices of "Xin Du Jian" and "Xin Chen Ke Jian" were stable. The prices of other grades of rice showed a softening trend. Only "Xin Yangjian" had been in short supply for several days, and sales were still good yesterday, leading to a price increase of 2-3 jiao. The price of "Dong Xin Geng" fell by 2-3 jiao, and there were virtually no inquiries.</p>
<h3>New Soybeans from Zhengyangguan Enter the Market</h3>
<p>Sesame Seeds are Relatively Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday, 20 bags of new soybeans and oil soybeans from Zhengyangguan were transported by major businesses to the market. The color and luster were still good, but the size of the seeds varied. Since they were new goods, the quality was not sufficient, and the price opened at 3.65 yuan, which was divided up by local businesses. It is said that this good price, being the first time the goods entered the market and being in short supply, may be difficult to maintain. The supply and sales of other new soybeans were well-connected, but the situation of raising prices and lowering prices was stable, and the market situation remained stable. The supply of new sesame seeds was only scattered, and the market was also deserted, so the market price was relatively stable. Yesterday, 90 bags of Tushan sesame were opened at a price of 5.5 yuan, 40 bags of Bozhou sesame at a price of 6.15 yuan, and 32 bags of Zhangbaling sesame at a price of 5.8 yuan. The turnover of old sesame seeds in foreign firms and retail households was also strong, so the market was also firm, it is said.</p>
<h3>客秈 Rising by Several Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday, both foreign and domestic rice markets showed improvement. Foreign rice has been arriving in Shanghai continuously on orders, and the market was originally expected to decline. However, most of the arrivals were delivered to customers, and the inventory in the market did not increase. Furthermore, the sales of foreign rice were not as sluggish as they had been in recent days. Yesterday, local businesses transported 3,500 bags of No. 1 Saigon rice from the mainland to the local market, priced at 10.06 yuan for the top grade and 10.023 yuan for the middle grade. There were 200 tons of goods loaded in September for futures, which were transported to the mainland by local businesses at a price of 4.55 yuan, similar to the previous market. However, the underlying trend had been showing signs of firming, as it was driven up by the rising prices of domestic rice. The inventory of domestic rice has been decreasing daily, and the supply has not been strong, but the demand from the mainland has been very strong. There have also been inquiries from local businesses. Yesterday, local and mainland businesses each took around 1,000 bags, and the price rose by 5 fen to 1 jiao compared to the previous day. This was due to the limited supply and active sales, and the market sentiment was unanimously upward.</p>
<h3>閘北 Goods: Orchid Seeds Rebound by One Yuan</h3>
<p>Recently, the sales of orchid seeds have shown some activity, and the supply has been limited, so the market has gradually stabilized. Yesterday, the price of high-quality goods in the market opened one yuan higher than the previous session.</p>
<p>However, it remains difficult for goods of lower quality to improve, and there are some transactions at the original price. It is also said that land prices have also improved, as the inventory is not thick. High-quality goods in the market may continue to rise.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Tallow Oil's Downward Trend Unabated</h3>
<p>Tallow oil should be in the peak season for autumn sales, but it is very different from previous years, leading to a step-by-step decline in the market. The situation in Hankou is extremely sluggish, and sales are also deserted, almost like the off-season in summer. Currently, heavy Jing tallow is priced at around 13.78 yuan in Hankou, and plain Jing tallow is priced at 13 yuan. Macheng oil is weak at 13 yuan. A turnaround seemed possible one week ago, but it was only a flash in the pan. The market only showed some vitality for a day or two before resuming its decline. Recently, it has been even worse than before. The inventory of local merchants is very thin, but sales are washed clean, so even with the thin inventory, the market is still soft. Sales open at only 17 yuan for heavy Jing, 16.34 yuan for plain Jing, and 15.45 yuan for Macheng oil. This is all because soap factories have no sales, and they rely on candle-making venues. How much can they sell? Therefore, no matter what, the supply always exceeds demand. Although it is said that the new harvest is far away, the old oil cannot be used up. Even with the current low market price, it may still be difficult to gain a foothold.</p>
<h3>Metals: Copper Sheets and Iron are Sold to Tianjin Merchants</h3>
<p>The autumn wind is blowing gently, and the weather is gradually getting colder. Tianjin and other merchant groups are preparing for winter sales, so recently there has been an unusually large number of people adding copper sheets and iron. The spot goods on the market are almost sold out, and the market is skyrocketing. The price of 18-gauge sheets opened at around 11 yuan, and 3- to 10-gauge sheets were around 10 yuan, which is 5 jiao to 1 yuan higher than before. In the past two days, these merchant groups have purchased a total of 2,000 to 3,000 bundles. Local sales have also reached 500 to 600 bundles. Therefore, the market situation is so good that it can be said to be unique in the current market.</p>
<h3>Textiles: Plain Colored Zigong Woolens are Discounted and Sold</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trend of woolens remained similar to the previous days. Both retail and wholesale transactions were brisk, and the prices were still in a downward trend. The market price of plain colored Zigong woolens has plummeted. If there are whole boxes of original textiles, the sellers are willing to make special concessions, as the inventory is full in Shanghai and Japanese goods are being ordered frequently. It is anticipated that prices will fall sharply again in two weeks, so the industry is competing to offer lower prices in order to sell them off in advance. However, it is still too early for leather overcoats to enter the market, so even though the goods are cheap, the buyers do not have a great need. Yesterday, No. 1 colored Zigong woolens from Huabo Head Office were sold at only 11 yuan per yard, No. 2 at 9.5 yuan, and No. 3 at 7.75 yuan. Other ordinary Western goods were sold at just over 6 yuan, and Japanese goods were sold at just over 5 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Zhejiang's Autumn Cocoons are Self-Reeled into Silk</h3>
<p>Zhejiang's autumn cocoons are under the strict control of the Zhejiang Construction Department, which has pre-borrowed huge amounts of money, sent personnel to various regions to set up offices to purchase fresh cocoons, bake them into dry cocoons, transport them to Hangzhou, and reel them into factory silk. Farmers are prohibited from reeling and baking their own cocoons and are not allowed to sell cocoons. Therefore, no Zhejiang autumn dry cocoons have been transported to Shanghai this year. Only a few dozen kilograms of sample cocoons have been sent from Hangzhou to Shanghai for testing the size of the reeling yield. Rumors that large quantities of Zhejiang autumn dry cocoons have been transported to Shanghai are not true, it is said.</p>
<h3>Low-Grade Black Tea Sales to England are Brisk</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Ningzhou, Anhua, and other black teas from companies such as Yingzhuang Jinlong and Tianyu were being purchased due to requests from England, and over a thousand chests were sold across the city. Sales were not deserted. Ning tea was sold at 33 yuan, and An tea was sold at 30 yuan. There were no changes in the market compared to before. Companies such as Luzhuang Zhenmei and Zhenmei from Luzhuang, Xiehe Fushi and Tianxiang also had scattered purchases. High-grade Chouxin Zhenmei from Tunxi's high-end factories opened at 118 yuan at the top of the market, and ordinary goods were sold at 80 yuan, with no increase or decrease compared to before. As far as green tea is concerned, the sales of the Gongxi brand from low-end factories were the most sluggish.</p>

<h3>On the Question of the Characteristics of Art</h3>
<p>— Shiqin</p>
<p>What is art? To this question, many people's answers are nothing more than: "Art is a social phenomenon," or "Art is a means of conveying thoughts and emotions." Such statements are not only much more progressive than those that say "Art is the expression of human nature" or "Art is the expression of beauty," but are also very correct in general circumstances. However, this correctness only has meaning in general circumstances. Once the question of the characteristics of art is touched upon, such statements are felt to be somewhat insufficient. Because generally speaking, whether it is politics, economics, philosophy, or science, all are "social phenomena" and can be said to be "means of conveying thoughts and emotions." If art is only explained in this way, then art is not distinguished from politics, economics, philosophy, and science, and the characteristics of art are not displayed.</p>
<p>The difference between art and politics, economics, science, and philosophy lies in: the former is a comprehensive and concrete description, while the latter is an analytical and abstract explanation; the former organizes thoughts and emotions through the power of vivid images, while the latter organizes thoughts and emotions through the power of understanding. The so-called characteristics of art lie here. We know that whether it is painting, music, novels, poetry... and other artistic phenomena, they all technically organize certain social consciousness through living things and beautiful forms. Colors and lines that are not organized artistically cannot be called painting; sitting next to a piano and randomly playing without following a certain score will never constitute the form of music; listing some political theories and religious doctrines, or arranging many 2+3 or X×Y and other mathematical formulas, will certainly not be called literature... In short, no matter what art it is, it cannot lack certain beautiful forms and the power of living images.</p>
<p>The famous literary critic Jujyo said in his "Looking at Art from a Social Perspective": "It goes without saying that depicting the inner sorrow of a certain protagonist in psychological terms, rather than simply describing 'he sobbed,' can move us more deeply. Except for those who have a tendency to feel sorrow themselves, tears are not a very contagious phenomenon. Tears are the final result of emotion. If the cause of the sorrow cannot be inferred, and the cause cannot be seen as sufficiently powerful, tears alone may not immediately arouse the sorrow of others." These are truly the words of a master!</p>
<p>Art must move people. Artistic works that cannot move people are the worst, even unworthy of being called artistic works. But what makes art move people is entirely due to its power of description; in the same thing, under the same dominating concept, works created by artists with greater artistic talent or with greater descriptive power are bound to be more great and more moving. But how to describe it? This touches upon the question of the characteristics of art. We already know that art expresses human thoughts and emotions with beautiful forms and living concrete things. The so-called artistic description must of course be concrete and profound, not abstract sermons, not superficial narratives, because this will not arouse our great emotions. Jujyo understands the characteristics of art and knows that concrete and profound descriptions are necessary to deeply move us, so he believes that concretely describing the psychology of the sorrowful, and "translating the inner sorrow into psychological terms, rather than simply describing 'he sobbed,' can move us more deeply." To say it more concretely and completely, it is more moving to concretely and profoundly describe the sorrow from the expressions, actions, and all things related to the sorrowful, rather than abstractly and superficially saying "he sobbed."</p>
<p>In our criticism circles, some critics completely ignore the characteristics of art. For a work, they only ask whether the concepts in its content are correct, regardless of its artistic expressiveness; they often tell general young writers: it is necessary to have correct concepts, the methods of description are only technical problems, not the value of criticism, and they affect the efforts of general young writers in art. This is the result of not knowing that art must be vividly described and ignoring the characteristics of art.</p>
<p>Of course, the so-called characteristics of art are not something mysterious, but can only be understood by associating them with the concrete things, concrete thoughts, and emotions that they express. Without the content of thoughts and emotions of art, there will be no formal characteristics; beauty that expresses nothing, forms that express nothing, absolutely do not exist. If the content of the thoughts and emotions of art comes from the society in which mankind lives, not from outer space, then the so-called characteristics of art, in the final analysis, are also determined by society. Therefore, the characteristics of art do not exist in itself, but exist in its generality (sociality): the beautiful forms of art and the power of living images can only be understood under the saying "art is a social phenomenon."</p>
<p>However, saying this is not denying the existence of the characteristics of art, but explaining its meaning. Because art differs from other disciplines and can independently become an academic department entirely because it has certain characteristics. Otherwise, art would not be able to exist at all.</p>
<p>Therefore, I hope that critics will not ignore the characteristics of art, carefully guide writers on how to describe, and not just recite some formulas to the writers; as for general young writers, artistic cultivation is especially important. Because only works that are artistically completed can be called artistic works, otherwise they are something else.</p>

<h3>Collecting Relief</h3>
<p>— Jiayin</p>
<p>Anqing Correspondence</p>
<p>This year's great drought disaster in 371 counties of 15 provinces has driven tens of thousands of poor farmers away from their homes to live a miserable life of wandering. "Collecting Relief" is another name for their organized wandering "fleeing famine." This word vividly depicts the collective and tragic nature of the famine victims' wandering life. The meaning of the word "collecting" is easy to understand, and "relief" means "moving forward with difficulty" or "depending on fate."</p>
<p>Having explained the title, I would like to give a brief account of the wandering lives of the native disaster victims and the foreign disaster victims in Anqing and the six counties of the former prefecture. This year's drought in the six counties of Anqing—Huaining, Tongcheng, Taihu, Qianshan, Wangjiang, and Susong—is unprecedentedly severe. The farmers, who were already in deep water, are even more unable to support themselves. The farmers of Zongpu, Lengshui, and Dingjia Sanbao in Anqing, for example, once formed a team of more than a thousand people, carrying dead branches on their heads and carrying a large dragon.</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>Mountain Dragon God into the city for a parade to petition; now that the disaster has become a reality, they have no choice but to beg for food separately or go "collecting relief" in groups. Begging for food is an undignified matter for them. Few men go, while women (especially young women) sneak out of their territory at night with their heads wrapped in towels. Once they are far away and people do not recognize them, they dare to beg. "Collecting Relief" is quite different in scale. There are "small relief" groups consisting of only one or two villages, with one or two hundred people, and there are "large relief" groups consisting of one or two thousand people, or two or three thousand people. Each family in "collecting relief" never sends only one person; except for leaving an old man or old woman to "watch the house," almost the whole family is mobilized. The organization of "relief" is very simple. "Small relief" groups only have one or two "relief leaders," while "large relief" groups have some officials to handle negotiations, distribute and manage items, in addition to the "relief leaders." The "relief leaders" are mostly publicly elected by the disaster victims. These people are mostly highly respected, educated, and moral. Some even had "academic honors" such as "scholars" and "officials" during the Qing Dynasty. They themselves could have avoided fleeing famine, but for the benefit of the majority of disaster victims, they had to come out and serve the public.</p>
<p>"Collecting relief" also has certain procedures. After the disaster victims form the "relief" group, they must first apply to the county government for a passport. They can only start their journey after obtaining the passport. When they arrive at a place, they must first present their passport to the local district office before they can move freely within the territory. After the district office stamps the passport, it begins to allocate funds to the area. There are several ways to allocate funds: some are borne by merchants, some are divided equally among the fields, and some are levied from households, mostly jointly borne by a village or a security unit. Some rural areas have "public property," and the person in charge will set aside a portion of the public funds for this purpose in order to reduce the burden on each household. Every year, when famine is expected to be widespread, the people who manage public property must plan early and prepare the supplies in advance to avoid being rushed at the last minute. Most of the supplies are rice, and some are given in money. Usually, the "relief" groups arrive in September and October of the lunar calendar, and the most "relief" groups arrive in November, but they have already pounded the rice in August and September (lunar calendar) waiting for it. This supply is very reliable. The district office only needs to send a "flying note" to each village to ask for it, and the disaster victims can immediately go and get it. This situation is mostly the same in the counties of Anhui.</p>
<p>The number of people recorded on the "collecting relief" passport is often inaccurate. For example, a "relief" group originally has only one thousand people, but in order to get more supplies, they can fill in two thousand people on the passport. Fortunately, there are many people, and people will not come to count you when you arrive at a place. But the place you arrive will never allocate supplies according to the number of people on your passport. Usually, most of the supplies are given at a 70% discount. The "relief leader" will initially ask for a high price, at which time the place must also send one or two people who are good at socializing and speaking to negotiate with him to reduce the supply to the minimum. There must also be a respectable gentleman to manage the money, rice, and grain to prevent the handlers from enriching themselves and the disaster victims from not getting the benefits.</p>
<p>In reality, what a disaster victim can get every day is also very little. Each person gets about one liter of rice a day. This rice can also be converted into money. As for firewood and clothing, the local area probably does not care, and the disaster victims have to pick up firewood themselves. They dig a mud stove on the ridges of the fields, under the feet of dams, and in the river banks, and cook for themselves. They have no vegetables or firewood, so they often go to the towns and villages to forcibly take what others have, and incidents of conflict with local residents are not uncommon.</p>
<p>Few "relief" groups are able to maintain themselves intact until "returning to their hometown." Most of them disperse along the way, because some people with special skills can rely on their own skills to eat. For example, those who can sing, who can "play connected horns," who can do martial arts, and who can perform magic can live on their own skills and are unwilling to follow the "relief" group on long journeys. Some young women, especially those who can sing ditties and have beauty, often meet some rich young men and masters along the way. They are lured into committing themselves, and they get more than enough to live on from them. When they first come out, most of them are tattered, and when they encounter this kind of opportunity, they can immediately wear silk and satin. In this way, they are naturally unwilling to follow the "relief" group to run around in the wind and dust. Because many people are scattered along the way, if a "relief" group starts with one thousand people, it may not be able to retain three or four hundred people when they return home to farm in March of the following year.</p>

<h3>After Reading Ms. Unfortunate's Two "Appeals for Help"</h3>
<p>— Chang Pei</p>
<p>During the "January 28th" Incident, how many Chinese compatriots' lives were sacrificed under the barbaric Japanese imperialist artillery fire? How much property of the Chinese people was destroyed? Although two or three years have now passed, the bones of Chinese compatriots who died under the atrocities of the Japanese army can still be found in the broken tiles and rubble of Zhabei; the tragic cries of the Chinese people whose property was destroyed by Japan are constantly attacking our eardrums, causing people to feel sorrow and indignation! Ms. Unfortunate's two appeals for help are a concrete manifestation of this tragic phenomenon.</p>
<p>In her "Second Appeal for Help," Ms. Unfortunate said: "Since the January 28th rampage by the Imperial Army, our home has been burned, and the life we have lived has been like searching for a path on a cliff, becoming more and more difficult. The trauma we have suffered in our minds is like a knife in the heart, with the blood never ceasing. Adding to this the entanglement of illness, the weeping of young children, the cold stares of neighbors, and the pressing attacks of hunger and cold, the joy of living is simply exhausted, and the prospect of peace is only death." This is a true depiction of their situation. In such a tragic situation, their family has struggled for two or three years, all the way to today. The pain they have experienced during this time is of course unimaginable to outsiders.</p>
<p>Now, Ms. Unfortunate's husband can find work, but he needs a "buying-life fee" of four hundred yuan; and they, who have been poor and sick for a long time, have no way to find this large sum of money. Therefore, having no other option, they wrote down their actual situation and appealed to society for help, hoping to borrow four hundred yuan to maintain the lives of their family. In her two appeals for help, Ms. Unfortunate described their tragic situation very truthfully. I believe that as long as they are human, after reading Ms. Unfortunate's tragic words of appeal, they will surely feel sad and shed tears. This is not because the form of her article is beautiful, but mainly because her article is a true, tragic lament of a group of people who have suffered cruel treatment from society. I dare say that such an article that can make people feel sad and shed tears can only be written by Ms. Unfortunate, who has personally experienced the situation, and those whose lives are similar to hers, or those who have great sympathy for them and understand them very well. Those "talented writers" who live a beautiful life and possess vulgar thoughts cannot write it.</p>
<p>After Ms. Unfortunate's first appeal for help was published in this journal, she soon received five letters that expressed complete sympathy for them. Some provided them with financial assistance, others gave them clothing, and some even offered to give them their own jobs: although this did not solve their problem, and they had to appeal again, it showed that the great compassionate psychology of humanity (not the false charitable psychology of the so-called "philanthropists") still exists in Chinese society. As for what the world-weary moralists say about "humanity being cruel" and "people's hearts being treacherous," I think this should be said to those who represent evil forces. Great compassion exists among the general public.</p>
<p>Of course, I am very sympathetic to Ms. Unfortunate's appeal for help; as for those who provide assistance to her in various ways based on the great compassion of humanity, they are even more admirable. However, I want to say that the problem raised by Ms. Unfortunate is not just a problem for her or her family, but a very significant social problem in China today: it is absolutely impossible to solve this with general appeals for help and general assistance, which are not fundamental solutions.</p>
<p>Ms. Unfortunate is appealing to society for help because of poverty, to seek employment, and for the lives of her family. The problems she raises are poverty and unemployment. But, everyone think about it, in China today, how many people are as poor as Ms. Unfortunate and even poorer than them? I'm afraid there are countless. Also, Ms. Unfortunate and her husband are both intellectuals, understand foreign languages, are skilled in calligraphy, and can write articles. Their knowledge and ability are certainly above the average level. But, what about now? They have no job, and their clothes, stools, cooking pots, and door locks have all been pawned off. Food, clothing, and shelter are all problems. Having no other option, they have appealed to society once and twice! If people like them are like this, then how will the countless farmers in the bankrupt countryside and the many unemployed workers in the cities live? In this situation, is it possible to solve the employment problems and living problems of countless unemployed people with just general "appeals for help" and general "assistance"? Even if the problems of Ms. Unfortunate and her family are temporarily solved by "appeals for help," then what about the unemployment problem of the entire China and the poverty problem of the majority of people? Can these also be solved by "appeals for help" and "assistance"? I believe that no one who is not a completely ignorant fantasist would give an affirmative answer to this.</p>
<p>Therefore, I think that "appeals for help" and "assistance" are only temporary remedies and cannot solve the problem at all. They cannot be used often.</p>

<p>Disaster just arrived at that place. Of course, they won't go very far, and they will soon return to their hometown. Departing from the counties of Anqing, most of them go to southern Anhui, and few go to northern Anhui. In recent years, disaster victims from other places have come to this area almost every year, mostly from Yingzhou, Bozhou, Shouzhou, and Fengyang in northern Anhui, and the Huangmei area of Hubei often has disaster victims entering the area. However, in the past year or two, the right of disaster victims to flee and beg has also been restricted, because large groups of disaster victims often cause trouble. Therefore, the county often does not sign the passports requesting "collective begging." As a result, the disaster victims will fall even deeper into the abyss of hunger and death. "The strong go to the four directions, and the old and weak fill the ditches." This is probably the sad fate of the disaster victims?</p>
<p>The Scenery of Great Shanghai</p>
<h3>A Visit to the First Nursery</h3>
<p>— Yu Ying</p>
<p>One morning, the sun shone on the horizon, and I walked alone on the gravel path bathed in sunlight, walking, walking; after about a quarter of an hour, the large black characters of "First Nursery" appeared in front of my eyes...</p>
<p>Going through a narrow alley, after walking not far, I saw a long, narrow wooden sign with the words "First Nursery of the Shanghai Children's Welfare Committee."</p>
<p>As soon as I stepped into the tall black iron gate, a police officer in a black uniform walked up to greet me: "Sir, who are you here to see?" His attitude was very kind.</p>
<p>"Is your director here? I'd like to see him." As I said this, I handed him a business card.</p>
<p>"Oh! Are you here to interview for the news? The director won't be here for a while. Please come in and sit down." He looked at my business card and led me inside.</p>
<p>I followed him closely, turned two corners, and saw a three-bay Chinese-style house; in front of the door were planted many flowers and trees, and there was a long orange tree made of stone, which looked like a small garden.</p>
<p>The police officer went in first and handed the business card to another gatekeeper, who greeted me and left.</p>
<p>I nodded to him and followed the gatekeeper inside. This three-bay house, although not as grand as a large Western-style house, was only recently built, so everything inside was new. As soon as you enter, there is a courtyard, with plenty of light, and it is also cleaned very cleanly; in the middle of the courtyard, there is a carousel for children to ride, with horses, airplanes, and rocking chairs on it, and four children can ride at a time. There are also bicycles, seesaws, swings and other sports equipment. Walking through the courtyard is the living room. When I entered, there were more than twenty children sitting there, all staring at me, a stranger, with surprised eyes; I looked at the different expressions of those children and couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>The gatekeeper invited me to sit down in the living room and told me that the director would not be here until eleven o'clock.</p>
<p>The arrangement of this living room is quite elegant in its simplicity; there are two large sofas next to it, covered with snow-white covers, like a hospital ward. On the east wall hung five photos of Mayor Wu and the Director of Education, and on the other side were several statistical charts of the children's family situation. The first chart records the name, origin, age, gender, family situation, and parents' occupation of each child. The second is the occupational classification of the children's families here. Now I will copy it below:</p>
<p>Academic circles: 25 people</p>
<p>Business circles: 18 people</p>
<p>Industrial circles: 2 people</p>
<p>Film circles: 3 people</p>
<p>Political circles: 7 people</p>
<p>Judicial circles: 3 people</p>
<p>Police circles: 2 people</p>
<p>The total number here is only 60, and according to this chart, the quota is already full.</p>
<p>Time passed quickly. I hadn't even seen everything clearly in this room when the director here arrived.</p>
<p>After a brief exchange of greetings, I began to explain my purpose.</p>
<p>He smiled slightly and looked at me and said: "Everything here is developing very quickly, and the quota was full a few months ago; but every day, people come here asking us to take care of their children. I don't know how many there are. Look!" As he said this, he handed me a large stack of books. "These registration books are all full. I simply can't think of a good way to satisfy the desires of the people who love the nursery. We feel very sorry."</p>
<p>As I listened to him, I opened the books and looked at them. I saw that more than 300 people had already registered in these books. It was indeed not easy to think of a way to accommodate so many people.</p>
<p>"Judging from this, Mr. Yang, why don't you add another one?" I said.</p>
<p>"I've thought about that too, but what about the expenses? Comparing the income and expenditure of the current 60 children, at least 500 yuan has to be compensated every month. We are saving on expenses in everything here, and we are purely volunteering here. There are a total of ten or so staff members, but everyone's duties are very heavy, and the treatment is not more generous than other occupations; the reason why everyone can do their duty is entirely due to the strong will and harmonious spirit." He said with a smile on his face.</p>
<p>Seeing that it was getting late, I stood up and asked him to take me on a tour.</p>
<p>"Okay, okay." He quickly stood up.</p>
<p>Behind the living room is the children's washroom. Several tall wooden cabinets are placed against the wall, and two rows of rectangular washstands are placed in the middle, with a total of twelve basins. Under the short wall facing the window are hung many things such as towels, toothbrushes, and mouthwash cups, numbered from one to three. The children wash their faces automatically in the morning, and the nanny is only responsible for supervising them. Opposite the washroom is the dining room. All the tables and chairs are suitable for the height of the children; each person has a table, arranged side by side, almost like a classroom. As we walked in, the piano sounded clang clang in the classroom, and all the children stood up and walked towards the dining room in time with the beat.</p>
<p>He smiled at me and said, "The method of educating children here is slightly different from their mother's education at home; you see, before mealtime, they don't clamor for food like they do at home. When the meal is set, just press the piano, and they will all come."</p>
<p>The children entered the dining room, found their fixed seats, and ate silently; I looked at this situation and couldn't help but smile and say: "Mr. Yang, these children are probably the typical soldiers of China in the future, otherwise, I don't think there will be such good discipline, right?"</p>
<p>Coming out of the dining room, I looked at the bathroom; inside there were three shower heads, and four small Western-style basins, the equipment was almost as complete as the adult bathroom.</p>
<p>Coming out of the bathroom, I went upstairs for a tour. The cleanliness of the layout was the same as downstairs; there were three bedrooms upstairs. Newborn babies to six-year-old children are divided into three levels, each occupying one room. There are twenty-four children aged two to six, each with a small black iron bed; a piece of pajamas and a towel are hung on one end of the bed, which is prepared for the child to cry. There are the most children from newborns to two years old, each with a bed, and the equipment is almost the same as before, but there are a few more nurses. They are mostly experienced and very careful in nursing children. There are also three wet nurses who specialize in feeding some children who are born with deficiencies, because the effect of milk is not as good as human milk after all.</p>
<p>After visiting all the places, I felt that the equipment of this "nursery" was already very scientific; later, when I walked downstairs with him, I sighed and said: "The equipment is indeed too good, but the quota is a little too small!"</p>
<p>"Yes! There's no way to do it. The more children are admitted, the more expenses will be; according to the current situation, we already feel that we can't support it, but the treatment of the children is still the same. We only ask that we can raise these dozens of children well, and we will feel at ease!"</p>
<p>Coming out of his place, the sun was already high in the sky; I then felt that my stomach was still empty, so I immediately took a car back to my apartment.</p>

<p>Famous People Interview Record</p>
<h3>Impressions of Literary Celebrity Shen Congwen</h3>
<p>— Zhou Leshan</p>
<p>The draft of this impression record was made three years ago, and it was not until today that I was able to fulfill my wish. On this rainy night, how much I miss Mr. Shen.</p>
<p>My understanding of Mr. Shen Congwen's works was many years ago, when I had just graduated from university and went to teach in an inland middle school. It was an important town on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. There were beautiful mountains and rivers, but what was lacking was books. In the school's library, there were only a few thread-bound books and a copy of "Fiction Monthly"; because the students liked to make trouble and often went on strike, those who were teachers lived a life that was exactly the opposite of Zhuge Liang's: "Well-fed and idle."</p>
<p>It was during that period that I read Mr. Shen Congwen's "Fourteenth Night" in a certain issue of Fiction Monthly.</p>
<p>"Fourteenth Night" gave me a very good impression, shocking me with Mr. Shen's genius. Soon, I left that ancient city and lived a wandering life in various cities along the Yangtze River and the Pearl River. When I occasionally rested, I also read many of Mr. Shen's new works one after another; however, it was not until I settled in Shanghai in 1930 that I had the opportunity to meet Mr. Shen.</p>
<p>It was in May of that year that I visited Mr. Zha Shiyuan at the China Vocational Education Society. We happened to talk about Mr. Shen, who lived nearby. Therefore, because of the relationship that Mr. Zha Shiyuan and Mr. Shen had known each other, that visit was made possible.</p>
<p>At that time, Mr. Shen rented a place upstairs in a Russian restaurant on Luban Road. No one would have thought that a writer would live in such a place. After asking the owner of the restaurant, I climbed a lot of steep ladders with Mr. Shiyuan to reach the third floor where Mr. Shen lived.</p>
<p>When Mr. Shiyuan knocked on the door with his finger, I imagined that Mr. Shen must be a tall and extraordinary young man; because I had read many of his works such as "After Enlistment." Who knew that the person who came out to greet us was a thin Mr. Shen.</p>
<p>After everyone entered the room and sat down, he chatted with Mr. Shiyuan. I took this opportunity to browse the scenery in the room; it was a slanting square building facing the street. The window was filled with woodcut old books such as ballad books. There was no bookshelf, only a writing desk and an iron bed.</p>
<p>Mr. Shen was talking to Mr. Shiyuan about Xu Zhimo; "Zhimo's mother died, do you know?" he asked. "I know, I have already received the obituary," Shiyuan replied. Mr. Shen then turned to ask me: "Mr. Zhou, what have you been writing lately?" "I haven't written anything, I've only written a few children's literature books; I wrote novels last year in Nanjing. What has Mr. Shen been writing lately?" I replied. "I haven't written for two months. Selling manuscripts is the most dangerous thing. It's not uncommon to not write for two months," Mr. Shen said.</p>
<p>As Mr. Shen spoke, he was writing with a brush, casually writing, constantly writing.</p>
<p>In addition, everyone talked a little about things in the literary world, and it was already past twelve o'clock. Mr. Shen insisted that we have lunch, but I felt uneasy about disturbing him on our first meeting, and prepared to leave. But Mr. Shen refused, and insisted that we order Russian food, saying: "The reason why I live upstairs in this restaurant is because of this, it is most convenient to eat."</p>
<p>During the meal, we also talked a lot about Hu Yepin and Ding Ling, because Mr. Shen and Hu Ding were good friends. Later, when I read Mr. Shen's "Remembering Ding Ling," I knew more details, and I knew that Mr. Shen was such a passionate friend.</p>
<p>About a month later, one day I came out of a cafe on Avenue Joffre with Mr. Fu Yanchang and Mr. Zha Shiyuan. Mr. Fu said: "I haven't seen Mr. Shen Congwen for a long time." Mr. Fu also said: "Mr. Shen is really an intriguing friend."</p>
<p>It was raining heavily at the time, so we hired a rickshaw to go to Luban Road for our second visit.</p>
<p>As soon as we ran in, Mr. Shen said: "I'm going to Beijing the day after tomorrow." I said: "That's really a good coincidence." Mr. Shen's study was just like he was getting ready to leave, even more chaotic than before. Mr. Shen was coming back from shopping outside. I saw many packages from Wing On Company piled on his bed.</p>
<p>Mr. Yanchang asked him: "Why do you want to go to Beijing? Isn't it good in Shanghai?" Mr. Shen replied: "The public canteen in Beijing can be on credit, this is the only reason I am going to Beijing." I interjected: "Isn't it more convenient to sell articles in Shanghai?" Mr. Shen just shook his head.</p>
<p>He was still the same as before, writing at his desk, casually writing, writing and tearing, grabbing them into a ball, and throwing them on the ground. The ground was full of scraps of paper.</p>
<p>Shiyuan has never been a big talker. He asked Shiyuan: "Do you know any news about Zhimo?" (Note: Xu Zhimo had not yet encountered the disaster at that time.) "Probably he has returned to Beijing?" Shiyuan replied. Mr. Shen moved out a lot of apples and said: "Let's gamble, who can eat more, it's not surprising that I can eat ten." Because Mr. Shen urged us, Shiyuan and I each ate two, and Mr. Yanchang only ate one. Mr. Shen said: "Why did you only eat one? That's not okay, how can you be so useless, you must eat two!" He embarrassed the generous Mr. Yanchang.</p>
<p>At that time, the rain outside the window had not stopped. Shiyuan and I left because we had something to do; I don't know if Mr. Yanchang ate the second apple?</p>
<p>Mr. Shen is such a passionate and capable person. Four years later, when writing this short article, it still seems to be vividly in front of me.</p>

<h3>Hot Wind (One-Act Play) (3)</h3>
<p>— Zhuang Tu</p>
<p>Li They dare not! I will never let them go either!</p>
<p>Seventh Master That's right!</p>
<p>Li Even if they are so poor that they have to sell their wives, I will not let them go! (Calculating accounts with an abacus) One six is six, three times five divided by one, nine subtract one add one, eight plus three divided by five add one...</p>
<p>Seventh Master I'm afraid that in the future, no one will want to buy wives, and they won't sell for any money. You have to be fiercer! (Goes to the inner room)</p>
<p>Li Of course! (Picks up the account book and abacus, sees that there is no one around, suddenly turns to a frivolous attitude, smiles slyly at Gui Zhen, and gently strokes her chin with one hand, speaking to her affectionately in a low voice) It doesn't matter about the money your father owes, and I can still...</p>
<p>Gui Zhen (Pushes his hand away) Don't be so... there are people outside... (Sound of talking in the distance)</p>
<p>Li (Praising her) Very beautiful. (Walks toward the inner room, stops, turns his head back) Bring in a bowl of tea. (Enters the inner room) By hitting her, she will have to submit. (She pours a cup of tea and sends it in.) (Sounds of talking, laughter, footsteps.)</p>
<p>Mrs. Wang (Appears at the doorway leading to the inner room, speaking to someone with a beaming smile) Next time, you are not allowed to speak up for her.</p>
<p>Seventh Master (Saying as he enters) I will listen to you... I am just worried that in this hot weather, arguing will harm your body...</p>
<p>(Suddenly, Gui Zhen's strange, sharp cry rises from the inner room, followed by her running out with disheveled hair and a look of extreme fear. Behind her follows Mr. Li, with a face full of fierce and murderous intent, his eyes flashing with beastly desire and anger. When he sees the two people at the door, he suddenly changes to a tone of lecturing her.)</p>
<p>Li (Lecturing Gui Zhen) A person in their twenties can't do anything right. I kindly tell you, and you still deliberately argue and refuse to listen... Someone like you is even worthy of working to pay off debts? Seeing that your father and brother can't pay the money, I said many good words in front of Seventh Master before he agreed to temporarily not ask your father to repay the money and instead took you in, this useless thing, and you still think people can't do without you!</p>
<p>Seventh Master What on earth is going on?</p>
<p>Li She... she... she... can't do anything, doesn't listen to instructions... She was cleaning in the inner room and made the whole room dusty. Gui Zhen That's not true!</p>
<p>Li (Pressing her) What isn't true? What isn't true? You say! You say! Get back in there, you useless thing! (Hurriedly enters the inner room)</p>
<p>Seventh Master (Also helping to scold Gui Zhen) You still don't admit you did something wrong!</p>
<p>Mrs. Wang (Pulling at his sleeve) You idiot! Didn't you see anything? (Whispers a few words in his ear, gestures toward the inner room, pointing to Gui Zhen) Understand?</p>
<p>Seventh Master (Nods) Ah! So that's...</p>
<p>Gui Zhen (Understanding) Yes. He hugged me...</p>
<p>Li (Rushing out angrily) Don't listen to her! (Takes the account book and abacus and goes out) I'm going to find your father and brother to settle accounts! (Walks outside)</p>
<p>Mrs. Wang (Watching Li leave) Men are all bad eggs!</p>
<p>Gui Zhen (Complaining) He hugged me... I didn't want to... then he...</p>
<p>Mrs. Wang I know everything.</p>
<p>Seventh Master (As if enlightened) So that's why he was so insistent on having Gui Zhen come.</p>
<p>Gui Zhen He has a black heart, he made the wrong calculations. We may be poor, but our bodies are clean.</p>
<p>Seventh Master That's not how you should put it... During a famine, a poor girl is really not worth much. I saw in the newspaper that during the drought in Shaanxi and Gansu, people could buy a girl in her teens or twenties for only ten or twenty yuan. One year of age is only worth one yuan. Like your father owing me sixty yuan...</p>
<p>Gui Zhen (Correcting him) Twenty yuan.</p>
<p>Seventh Master (Continuing) Fourteen dan of grain... (To be continued)</p>
