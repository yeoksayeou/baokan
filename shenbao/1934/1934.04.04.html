<h3 id="c28">匪區善後工作舉要 <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>我國匪患自開始嚴密堵剿以來匪區逐漸收復。已有限期肅清之望。故善後問題。不容不亟行考慮。茲以吾人管見所及。舉其犖犖大端如左。</p>
<p>（一）招撫流亡今日剿赤軍事。本非爭地之戰。而爲爭民之戰。匪區恢復後第一要着。自爲招撫流亡。究竟難民人數幾何。亟應切實調查。其法當在各省城市及難民聚集之處先行辦理登記。凡難民之籍貫年齡家庭狀况一一註明造册。如有查出爲赤匪淫威所迫不得已而降身事逆者。亦當寛其旣往。許以自新。在登記期内。又須設立收容所。儘速將難民資送原籍。壯丁以工代賑。担任築路屯墾等工作。老弱另由政府妥爲救濟。</p>
<p>（二）充實自衛匪區甫經收復。地方給養困難大軍駐紥。勢所難能自須充實民衆自衛能力。一面厲行保甲制度。一面加緊防禦工事。按保甲組織方法。已由政府公布條例。由户而甲而保而聯保以至于區。遞達於縣。脈絡貫通。指臂相應。本甚可取。無如匪區各縣眞能切實辦理者。尚不多　。保甲長濫用威福作踐鄉民。尤堪痛惡。人民徒增區公所等負担。而無補於實際。故亟應設法糾正保甲長之人選。須擇胆識兼備并經相當之訓練者任之選定之後尚。須隨時派員秘密考核。以杜流弊。此次剿赤軍事得力於　堡建築者甚大。凡鄉鎭有險可守者。建築土堡。以爲附近居民囤穀儲糧之所。繞以深壕預防偷襲堡外日夜放哨。堡内澈夜響更。以備萬一。至若向爲赤匪出入必經之孔道。則須加築裯樓樓基以高地與石地爲上選。以防匪黨踞高下攻或掘地而進。裯内派兵防守。子彈硝砲糧食柴水等物。儘量儲藏。以防悍匪圍困。裯堡之建築。無非在制匪活動。縱有警耗。亦可加緊封銷。前聞江西匪區。建築裯堡成績。頗爲惡劣。號稱優良者。僅樂平一縣。次之則爲貴溪。餘者數衍塞　。不成事體。嗣經該省省政府主席積極提倡。成績尚有可觀。良以匪區人民。刦後餘生。無力從事於此。故非仰賴政府統籌興辦不可。</p>
<p>（三）整理土地、赤匪醉心於王莽之［均田］制實行其分田政策燒契約。毁田界澈底没收澈底分配。將匪區農村經濟之基礎。摧毁無遺。關於收復匪區之土地處理辦法。業由南昌行營製定問答式十三種。以當説明。觀其内容。大槪爲（甲）維持土地私有制度。但對於地主則實行限由制。使其所有土地之面積。自一百畝地起。至多到二百畝爲止。超過限度。除納普通地税外。並納累進所得税。（乙）同時以和平的計口授佃辦法。使耕者都有田耕。此二原則合乎時勢。祗待實行。然在匪化已深之區域。經界盡燬業主死亡之土地。當必不少。究應如何支配。並未規定。吾人以爲在此種情形之下。祗能採取特殊手段。取消土地私有制度。發放農民耕種。至其實行公攤之詳細辦法。可由農村復興委員會斟酌定之。</p>
<p>（四）教育設施赤匪對於匪區人民。實施赤化教育。强迫接受。以麻醉其思想。過去剿赤軍事之所以屢得屢失。未始非因忽略匪區民衆思想之改變。有以致之。此後欲圖補救。自須從教育設施着手。第一。當力謀教育數量之普及。第二。凡匪區智識份子之逃亡於各處者。尤應廣爲收羅。資送回籍。蓋智識份子素爲鄉間所尊重。移風易俗。最爲有力也。</p>
<p>餘者如農村經濟之提倡。水陸交通之開發。吏治之澄清。人心之改善。固爲全中國復興必經之步驟。初不僅以匪區善後爲限姑闕而不論。</p>

<p>辛辛那提城蘇俄駐美大使在此間外交問題恊會講演之前、曾對報界發表談片、略謂、［吾人不信民主政治業已死亡、蓋吾國所行者、卽爲一種完全之民主政治、在此種民主政治之中、經濟平等而無階級之分、吾國生産設備、不能視爲私人之所有物、史丹林之勢力誠較旁人爲大、吾人並不視爲獨裁者、其勢力所以較大、因其能力超越他人也、吾人對於史丹林必須服從、不問其命令如何、史丹林雖受黨之監察、但吾人仍服從一人之指揮、蘇俄對於資本主義並無妥恊可能、其經濟制度之基礎、爲工作多者多得利益、並非採取絶對平等原則、而生産之設備亦爲國家之財産、次言及國際問題時、脱羅雅諾沃斯基謂、［歐洲形勢較一九一四年更爲緊張、］渠對於外傳蘇俄有意與日本作戰之説、加以否認、但承認修築雙軌鐵路之説、谓此正所以表示蘇俄有充分力量、足以應付威脋遠東和平之國家云、（按本年三月中旬、曾傳蘇俄爲防備遠東時局起見、計畫敷設横斷西伯利亞之大鐵路、與現有之西伯利亞鐵路成平行綫云云</p>

<h3 id="c92">日人控制下之東北鐵路（長春通訉） <a href="#c92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>東北以河川及海岸線之貧乏、故其交通、幾全頼鐵路、東北鐵路之建築、迄今數十年、而東北之開發、亦不過數十年、故若謂一部東北鐵路建築史爲東北發達史、亦殆無不可、</p>
<p>東北自九一八以後、其鐵路狀况、大異於前、不但日本以應付遠東當前緊張之局勢、而新築多數幹線、若敦圖·拉濱·克海·確立三大幹線系統、（卽一由南滿路出大連、二由朝鮮西幹線經平壤京城、三由京圖線出日本海、）抑且其管理權、亦有極大之變動、</p>
<p>九一八事變未爆發之前、東北鐵路管理系統、歸納之不外下列三種、</p>
<p>一·我國東北交通委員會領導下之國有鐵路、</p>
<p>二·日本南滿鐵道株式會社領導下之南滿路及其支線、</p>
<p>三·中蘇合辦之中東鐵路及其支線、</p>
<p>今則除第二項日本南滿路無大更動外、中蘇合辦之中東鐵路、於日車鐵蹄威脅之下、（如無故拘捕蘇籍職員等）蘇聯不得已、有將該路轉讓日本之説、不久以前、日本且有所謂買路會議、進行此事、至於我國有鐵路、已於去年三月一日、由僞交通部［委託］滿鐵管理、滿鐵方面、組織所謂［鐵路總局、］專司此事、其口實曾宣告爲使東北鐵路管理、趨於統一、以從事於合理之經營、使經濟與技術上之能率得以增進、實則此種掩飾、適爲欲蓋彌彰、蓋九一八以前、我國有鐵路在交通委員會領導之下、大事建築、在數年之間、用本國資本與技術、築成呼海·齊克·瀋海·吉海·四路、共長八九三公里、對南滿鐵路、採取大包圍姿勢、築葫蘆島以與大連相爭、確立聯運制度、減低運費、使滿鐵運貨數字、驟然下降、加以我東北當局、處處予以掣肘、於是滿鐵在此環境之下、幾陷死路、東北事變之爆發、其原因大半亦由於此、故此次日本遂迫令僞組織交出鐵路管理權、以免將來蹈此覆辙、抑且交通爲一國之血脈、其血脈旣握於日人之手、自無慮更有他變、且使於對蘇及對我戰爭時、得以由三大幹線系統、迅速運兵、以制敵機先、此種計劃、實至陰毒、</p>
<p>至於所謂［鐵路總局］管理下之我國有鐵路、約共十餘線、其名稱如下、</p>
<p>一·奉山線北寗鐵路之關外段、被日佔據後改稱奉山、起自山海關、至瀋陽止、其支線有錦州至北票、大虎山通遼等、</p>
<p>二·瀋海線、起自瀋陽至海龍止、爲純用本國資本技術築成之線東北事變後、曾由漢奸一度組織鐵路保安維持會管理之　　三·吉海線、此線建築時、日人曾以與滿鐵並行爲詞、提出抗議、我國對此理由欠缺之抗議、置之不顧、後卒底於成、</p>
<p>四·吉長線、起自長春至永吉止、</p>
<p>五·吉敦線、自永吉至敦化、爲著名之［吉會鐵路］之一部、</p>
<p>六·敦圖線、自敦化至圖們、亦爲吉會之一部、九一八以前以我國之阻撓、未能興築、日人强佔東北後、加速完成、現已通車、以上三線、（吉長吉敦敦圖）以其成一直線、故或有名之謂京圖線者、卽自僞京長春至圖們是也、</p>
<p>七·泗洮線、本線爲四平街至鄭家屯·鄭家屯至通遼·及鄭家屯至洮南三線合成、其形似义字、</p>
<p>八·洮昂綫、昂昂溪至洮南、全長二二四公里、</p>
<p>九·洮索線、自洮安至索倫、至今以經費困難、僅成洮安至懷遠鎭一段、</p>
<p>十·齊克綫、自昂昂溪至克山鎭、其齊齊哈爾至克山一部、完成不久、</p>
<p>十一·呼海線、海倫至呼蘭南面馬家船口（迫近哈爾濱、）全長二二一公里餘、</p>
<p>十二·拉濱綫、起自拉法至哈爾濱（濱江）止全長二六八里、</p>
<p>十三·克海線、克山至海倫、長一六七公里、本線與以上所述之拉濱敦圖三線、均爲最近由滿鐵［承包］築成、</p>
<p>東北鐵路現况、槪如上述、其他如鐵路警備、則由日關東軍根據所謂［日滿議定書、］亦由日人組織之鐵路總局掌握、至其方針、因鐵路爲我義軍不時襲擊之目標、且地域廣大、警戒不易、故已决定對策如下、（一）隨時變更客車開行時刻、於開行時並施以［先驅車］制度、以騐車軌曾否被破壞、（二）於車中施以戰爭設備、（三）嚴厲防止我義軍混入車内、（四）密佈情報網、使之報告義軍出没行動地、（五）完通信設備、以便救援、（六）調查危險地帶之實情、（七）增大鐵路警備能力、（八）建［鐵路愛護村、］對附近鐵路之村落、施以小惠、俾使之守望鐵路、然以路線過長、義軍又手段敏捷、出没無常、故亦未能收完全之效果也（三月二十三日）</p>

<h3 id="c95">蘇財廳長談蘇省財政整理情形 <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>半年來之整理漸上正軌</p>
<p>改善會計制度别除中飽</p>
<p>鎭江通信、江蘇財政、素稱困難、上年省府改組以後整理財政、視爲最重要工作之一、進行以來、成績昭著、如改良會計、確定預算、均爲各界所重視、近據財廳長趙棣華談關於半年來經過情形、亟錄於左、</p>
<p>蘇省素稱東南財富之區、近年以來、省縣地方、均感收不敷支、年復一年、積虧甚鉅、在一班理財者之觀察、不謂收入短絀、卽謂支出浩繁、以開源節流爲整理財政之至計、但現值農村經濟衰落之時、人民擔負已重、若再增加統税、或舉辦新税、均爲勢所難能、至支出方面、業已極度緊縮、各項事業、未舉辦者尚多、决不能因　廢食、是則源無可開、而流無可節、欲解决財政困難、亟應剔除中飽、杜絶糜費、　本省財政竭厥、原因不在收入之絀、而在吏胥侵蝕、不在支出之繁、而在用之不當、故以會計方法、整理財政、實爲今日整理蘇省切要之　、茲將本届省政府成立六個月之財政整理情形、分述於次、</p>
<p>統一財務行政</p>
<p>本省專欵龐雜、各省主管機關、收支不能統一、在財廳對於專欵、則因事權不屬、失其統馭、在主管廳、對於徵收機關、則又格於行政系統、考核難周、遂不免彼此隔閡、而各縣視專欵如同額外之收入、任意　挪短解、是則雖有專欵之名、而不足濟專辦事業之用、前經提出省政府會議議决統一辦法、除教育專欵另有規定外、其餘各項專欵、一律解交金庫、另由財政廳會同主管廳按照預算簽發支付命令、由金庫支付、現在實行已有四月、各項專欵收入、較前頗有起色、</p>
<p>設立會計主任</p>
<p>各縣向來對於收支各欵、簿記報表、多未遵辦、其原因或以縣政府事務　繁、精神不能貫注、或以縣政府經費有限、人才不能集中、自去年十二月起、已將税收較多縣份、先行設立會計主任計有二十二縣、專司辦理簿記及稽　縣政府收支欵項、雖不負現金出納及保管之責、然負有督促省欵掃解及縣欵存放之責任、分派以來、各縣積存欵項逐漸减少、金庫制度、得以確立、而會計組織、亦得日臻完備、</p>
<p>確立省預算</p>
<p>本省二十二年度、預在年度開始以前、未經確定、全年收支、漫無標準、本届省政府成立、在年度開始三個月後、以滿收滿支之原則、採量入爲出之主義、與各廳處一再討論、均蒙贊同將不經濟之支出及可緩之事業、分别裁减、確定槪算、收支相差、爲數不多、截至最近、除支出方面按照預算執行外、收入欵項與預算數、頗爲接近、虚收實支之弊、得以减除、（至本年度二月底止田賦徵起百分之六十六營業税百分之六十五契税百分之六十四）</p>
<p>審查縣預算</p>
<p>本省各縣地方預算、支離複雜、不一而足、每舉一事、卽增一種附税、以致各縣附加、常有超過正税者、雖有少數縣份、因正税過低、特别顯著附税之過高、然附税之龐雜、固無可諱言、且附税之增加、多有不待財廳核准、卽由縣貿然徵收者、尤爲不合、前經提出省政府委員會議决組織縣地方預算審查委員會、先由各縣縣長召集地方會議研究核减辦法、然後由各縣長分别携帶二十二年度預算草案來省、並由各廳派員出席、共同審查、庶各縣地方財政狀况、各廳得以明瞭審核標準、對於不經濟之開支及可省之費用、分别删改、以期欵不虚糜、計自去年十二月起開始審查、四月初旬、卽可完竣、一面卽以審查各縣二十二年度預算爲核定二十三年度預算之標凖</p>
<p>實行稽核制度</p>
<p>省縣預算確定以後、其實施有效問題、卽在稽核制度之完善與否、請就下列三點申述之、（一）關於有預算之實施查本省審計制度、向付闕如、各機關經費、雖按預算核發、其實支狀况、是否合乎預算、有無糜濫之處、從無合法機關、予以監督、故省預算確定以後、爲促其實施起見、有不得不有稽核機關之設立、此事已由省政府委員會通過設立稽核委員會、委員人選、由省政府遴選專門人才充任、爲一純粹超然機關、負稽核省欵收支之專責、（二）關於縣預算之實施、各縣地方預算由廳開會審查、確定以後、僅將事前監督之一部份工作完成、至於各縣是否按照核定預算實行、則須有以監督所有各縣收支計算書表及年度决算、卽由財廳稽核之縣欵、用之於縣地方、財廳執行監督亦處於超然地位、（三關於縣金庫之設立、各縣經收欵項、大都存放當地錢莊商號、不便稽核、易生流弊、故由省政府委員會議决各縣縣欵收支存放辦法、所有各縣政府、經徵縣税、由縣劃交欵産處存放、財政廳指定之金庫、各機關支領經費、卽由縣長核明塡發支付命令、再經會計主任、公欵公産管理處主任稽核後蓋章、向金庫支付、如斯、則縣欵收支得上軌道矣、</p>
<p>綜上所述數端、次第實行以後、收支集中、會計獨立、各機關及各縣政府經收欵項、無可騰挪、不僅省庫可以充裕、卽地方經費、亦不致有時感蹶竭之虞、全省財政、卽上正軌、同時各縣又正在辦理土地陳報中、一方面以會計制度、整理省地方之財政、一方面以辦理土地陳報、剷除積弊、减輕人民擔負、推行期年、吾蘇財政、或能逐漸整理就緒云云、（國聞社）</p>

<p>二十三年兒童節感言</p>
<p>邇來新生活運動、風行海内、全國各界、均有更始氣象、適承兒童幸福委員會徵稿及愚、竊念兒童爲民族生命之新機、其於新生活運動之關係、尚爲尤切、因揭此題、聊表所感、愚於去歳兒童紀念節、曾草［兒童運動與民族前途］一文、揭諸各報、大旨謂兒童有敏慧之天資、純潔之天良、活潑之天機、其智、其德、其體、均在成人之上、誠能教之養之、各得其方、自易蔚爲社會之長才、改進民族之質素、我國先哲、對於兒童問題、初未漠視、如曰［男有分、女有歸、壯有所用、幼有所長、　寡孤獨疾廢者、皆有所養、］又曰、［老吾老、以及人之老、幼吾幼、以及人之幼、］其愛護兒童、注意兒童之精神、槪可想見、惜乎晚近以來、教化廢弛、非但國家社會、漠視兒童、甚至身爲父母師長者、亦均不知其教養之責任、羣居終日、言不及養、行爲放浪、身心日壞、兒童爲將來民族之精魂、國家之基礎、長此以往、不加注意、則其所貽民族國家之患、何堪設想、一八○六年、普法戰爭之後、德國慘敗、屈服於拿破崙淫威之下、其復興功臣斐希德氏大聲疾呼、昭告其國民曰、［今日武力外交、均已爲敵人所限制、我人今日不能爲積極的抵抗、爲天下所非笑、負懦怯偷生之重　、然將何以自救乎、則惟有以將來國民之善良種子之播種者自居、且希望此種子之根株、日臻深固耳、］今日蔣委員長所倡導之新生活運動、歸納言之、亦猶斐希德Ｆisbte氏之所謂［國民的善良種子之播種］之動而已、此種運動、雖不能收效於目前、然其影響於將來者、則殊無限量、國人通病、每僅注意空間、而忽視時間、故但圖近利、而無遠慮、國難以來、國人之所以僅知浮囂妄動、而鮮能深謀遠慮、確立救亡興國之大計者、實坐此弊也、德國民族、因能共遵斐氏之主張、果不出二十餘年、而完成其復興之大業、古羅馬政治學者謝雪廬氏有言曰、［歷史爲時代的證人、眞理之明星、生活之導師］殷鑑不遠、史實猶在、我人倘能記取德國復興之往事、共體蔣委員長所倡導的新生活運動之要旨、認識新生活運動之重要對象、兒童對於今後兒童教育、兒童思想、兒童習慣、兒童道德、兒童身體、加以切實的訓導與鍜練、澈底改造其生活、充分發揚其優性、則十數年後、此輩優良種子之成長、卽我中華民族生命之再造、亦卽我民族復興之時機也、</p>

<p>尚何地位之足云、徧翻中國數千年之歷史、殊未見政府有提倡兒童事業之文、亦未見有創辦兒童事業之舉、傳云、［越十年生聚而十年教訓］、獨越王勾踐、嘗有此獎勵生殖及注意教養之事、此外未見其人、</p>
<p>今中國之情形、不患兒童之少而患在不健全、不患生殖之獎勵、而患在保育之無方、兒童之孱弱至此、國家之衰敗隨之、故欲復興中國、非人各認識兒童地位、努力建設兒童事業、培植國家之根本不可、事業之所當進行者、有數端焉、</p>
<p>（一）關於兒童身體之屬積極方面者、若注意兒童之清潔衛生、提倡兒童游戲及體育、創設或開放兒童公園、及運動塲等、屬消極方面者、若醫院之免費治療、及免費檢查體格等、</p>
<p>（二）關於智識方面者、若創辦兒童報紙、及其他刋物、創設兒童圖書館、舉行兒童演講、開映兒童教育電影、參觀動物園·博物院·等、</p>

<p>所欲進行之事、不　悉數、總之、兒童事業、關係於國家之存亡、社會之文野、民族之興衰者、至重且大、惟其效果、非一年二年可見、亦非五年十年可見、須在二十年三十年之後、又其設施、不以一村一鄉爲足、亦不以一縣一省爲足、須遍及全國而後可、因見效之緩、及其事功之鉅、遂爲人所恝置、中國數千年來未嘗有以兒童事業爲國策者、非無故也、然前代皆閉關自守、獨立尊榮、四鄰之文化甚低、一律目爲夷狄、今則列國紛爭、優勝劣敗、非從根本致力、將無以救國家之危亡、值此兒童佳節、吾人於紀念慶祝之餘、安能不注意及之、</p>

<p>我們要十年生聚、十年教訓、現在就中國的情形來講、暫時用不到生聚、只要保育已經生聚的兒童、教訓已經生聚的兒童、大家只要掙開眼睛一看、每年　蹋的兒童、也不知有多少、所謂　蹋、是廣義的、一種是生命上的　蹋、一種是智識上的　蹋、因爲經濟上的條件、生下了小國民、而不能自己養育他們、因爲經濟上的條件、養育到尚未健全的年齡、而卽使他們去做過分的勞工、結果犠牲了小國民的生命、這是所謂生命上的　蹋、因爲經濟上的條件、生下了小國民、而不能使他受教育、因爲經濟上的條件、受的教育、不够他們將來的運用、他們生了長了、但是只成功了一個無靈魂的軀壳、這是所謂智識上的　蹋、兒童是將來的主人、兒童是將來的戰將、我們却無緣無故把他們蹭蹋了、這就是减少了我們的主要戰鬥力、眞何等可惜、願大家負起責任來、保障兒童、愛護兒童、教育兒童、使這許多戰將、一個一個建樹了他們勇敢的軀魄、豐富的智識、爲中華民族爭生存、</p>

<p>改纂教材造成親日傀儡</p>
<p>提高學費抵制青年就學</p>
<p>（長春通訊）日本在東北對僞國之經濟·政治·軍事、均一手操縱、而對僞國之教育、更着着實行其侵略文化之毒計、因一國之强盛、根本全基於教育、若是則奴化東北教育、始可望僞國永爲其統制矣、茲彚集各情於次、</p>
<p>改繤教材</p>
<p>日本對僞國中等教育、異常注重、關於教授問題、以前曾選舉委員專從事蒐集材料、最近在奉天中學校舉行委員會、依據該會某委員所修之草案、更由其他委員编纂、而加以整理、至今年三月完成、自四月新學期起、卽用該項教材、由該委員蒐集之諸項資料、實在一千三百點之上、與在大連委員會所選擇約成五百頁左右、在最近之審議會上、有中等學校校長三十八名、充爲委員、更有日關東廳學務課栗林、事務官參加該會、曾予以嚴密檢閲、奴化東北教育之稿、始脱出矣、按暴日佔領東北後、卽極力檢拾不當解説、以東北與中國本非一體之謬論、竟有喪心病狂之漢奸、甘於爲敵役使、揑造黑白、附會暴日之怪論調、</p>
<p>變更學制</p>
<p>僞國文教部已通令各教務局、自本年春季始、鄉村各學校、除讀經學外、應特别注重研究日滿共存共榮之王道政法、而於校　或隙地、並自行耕耘、播種各種穀物、至於城市學商、應於課外、實習工業、其作品則由學校或讬商家代賣、因此鄉村學生則注意學　學農、城市學生則趨於工業化、而學問則均無睱研究、此爲日人所施之愚民教育政策、</p>
<h3 id="c174">日語滿語 <a href="#c174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>僞文教部所創辦之職員語學講習所、其目的教授日語滿語、以造就忠實馴　傀儡人材、現在該所又開始招募第四次學員、仍照舊授以日語滿語兩科、日語科設於長春公學校内、滿語科設於　町小學校内、兩科共分四部、每部修業六個月、日語科共招四百八十名、滿語科共招二百名、已於三月二十日開學、</p>
<h3 id="c175">提高學費 <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>僞國受日方主使、擬定於本年下學期開始、初級中學全年學費四十五元、（原二十一元）雜費十二元、（原三元）制服費二十元、入校時一次繳清、共七十七元、小學全年學費三十元、雜費七元、制服費二十元、亦一次繳清、共五十七元、（事變前小學全年各費不過三十元）按目前東北大荳值一元二角、高糧值六角計、農户每種地十畝、須負債二三元、小農完全破産、中農尚可支持、大農則喪額更甚、暴日卽根據此種現狀、提高學費、意在使無力担負者、根本不能就學、並對有力就學者、授以日製之教科書、使之奴化、今年以後、七歳以下之學童、將絶跡於小學之門矣、</p>
<h3 id="c176">設博物館 <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>僞政府擬在瀋陽創設國立博物館、醖釀已久、迄未具體决定、經僞文教部之助力、决定在三經路湯玉麟之舊邸爲館址、於四月内卽可成立、該館長已委定袁金凱充任、現正在籌備一切、</p>

<p>僞國規定留學制度、所派往國外留學者、均爲培養外交漢奸人材、現已决定留學額數、計英法德美各三名、日本一百二十名、而日本留學額數獨多於他國者、以期多造就親日份子云、</p>

<h3 id="c180">法國之庚子賠欵 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>一、退欵之動機</p>
<p>法庚欵之退還運動、肇自民國成立時前後、其時我國教育界旅歐者有汪兆銘·蔡元培·吳敬恒·李煜　·張靜江諸氏在巴黎組織世界社、華法教育會、儉學會、勤工儉學會等機關、中法間教育事業日多、羣望因此促進兩國好感與注意、漸進而實現退欵與學之舉、</p>
<p>二、退欵之成熟時期</p>
<p>民國六年、歐戰正酣、我國因與法同爲恊約國、得將賠欵緩付五年、至民國十年十一月杪緩付五年期限届滿、我國人士認爲時機已熟起而作退欵運動、並先與法國方面創設里昂中法大學、以爲初步的發動、適法政府有决定中法實業銀行復業之計劃、擬將庚欵餘額全數退還、但須將此欵先行救濟中法實業銀行復業、自是退欵之舉漸具體化、</p>
<p>三、中法操文協定</p>
<p>民國十一年六月二十四日由法使提出節略交與前北京政府外交部、討論結果、雙方同意訂定恊定、規定將法庚欵餘額充作改組中法實業銀行及辦理中法間教育事業之用、其後法政府又要求將法庚欵改按金元（卽指美金）交付、經外交部駁復、但法方堅不承認、彼此爭執甚久、迨至民國十二年二月北京政府允以金佛郎計算、於是輿論大譁、國會亦反對、開會正式否决、此事遂成懸案、至十四年北京政府乘國會久已無形停閉遂於是年四月十二日與法使成立恊定、决定法庚欵撥爲恢復中法實業銀行、嗣教育界力爭、始分得一小部分辦理中法間教育及慈善事業之用、</p>
<p>四、退欵總數</p>
<p>法庚欵退還總額爲三萬九千一百五十八萬一千五百二十九佛郎零五生丁、按美金一元合法金五佛郎一八二六、折合美金、共爲七千五百五十五萬六千九百六十四元四五七、此項總數按照恊定逐年墊借與中法實業銀行作爲該行發行五厘美金公債之基金、而中法實業銀行卽以此項美金債券作（一）遠東債權人所持之無利證券、（二）辦理中法間教育及慈善事業、（三）代繳政府未繳清之股本餘額、（四）撥還中國政府所欠中法實業銀行各項債務等四項用途、</p>
<p>五、撥充教育文化事業經費之數目</p>
<p>自民國十五年起、中法實業銀行每年撥出美金二十萬元爲辦理中法間教育及慈善事業之用、其處理及支配方法、由法國政府代表與中國教育部代表每年恊商之、於是教育界設立中法教育基金委員會保管與支配此欵、並圖完成一種永久基金、歷年以來聞已補助中法教育機關甚多、如上海中法工學院、法國里昂中法學院、天津海軍醫學校、天津法國高等商業學校、巴黎中國學院、北平中法大學、上海　旦大學、北海瓊州及雲南等處之法國醫院、中法文化交换出版委員會、補助學者來華講演及其他中法間公益事業等、並購買有用書籍以供衆覽之用、</p>
<p>六、委員會組織</p>
<p>法庚欵委員會名爲中法教育基金委員會、其組織係由中法兩國代表圑相合而成、中國方面委員爲外交部代表一人、財政部代表一人、教育部代表一人、國立北京大學代表一人、國立東南大學代表一人、廣東大學代表一人、中法大學代表一人、法國方面委員爲法國駐華公使或其代表、以上兩方面代表於表决時中法兩國各有一權、其職權則根據中法恊定管理中法教育事業基金、並决定其用途、</p>
<p>七、現任委員人選</p>
<p>中國代表圑爲李煜　·沈尹默·易培基·劉錫昌（兼秘書）、蕭瑜（兼駐會秘書及中國代表圑幹事）·蕭文熙·法國代表圑魏　敦·巴爾·韓德威、</p>

<p>積欠總達四三四·八二四元</p>
<p>每年不敷二六五·六四五元</p>
<p>甘肅省教育廳長水楚琴氏、日前因向教部有所請示、故南下入京、晋謁王部長、面呈一切、業已公畢、復因事來滬、下榻東亞旅社、旋卽赴杭、茲於昨日返滬、發表甘肅教育現况頗詳、亟爲分誌於後、</p>
<p>校數·據云、現有大學（卽甘肅學院）一所、中等學校、省立者十五校、縣立者六校、私立者一校、高等小學計爲省立者十一校、縣立者一三九校、區立者六四校、私立者八校、初級小學計爲省立者十二校、縣立者七二六校、區立者八六七校、私立者七九校、幼稚園省立者二、私立者一、總計大學一校、中學二十二校、小學一八九六校、幼稚圜三、</p>
<p>學生現有受教學生計大學男生一八○人、中學男生一七七二人、女生一二八人、小學男生八四五七一人、女生三七一六人、幼稚生九三人、總計現有學生男女共九○三六六人、失學兒童八四六·五四八人、</p>
<p>經費來源計、分（甲）省欵、（乙）各縣地方欵、（丙）私欵、大學一所、年需經費九六、二三六元、中學二十二校年費三○三、三八六元、小學一八九六校年費三二四、○六三元、全年總經費共七二三、六八五元、尚有社會民衆教育機關、共二八七處、年費三、五一六元、派赴國内各大學生共六六人、年費一一、七九五元、留法一人、年費二、八八○元、總計全省每年各項教育經費、應爲八四九、九九五元、除由省欵支出五一五、六三九元外、每年不敷達二六五、六四五元、</p>
<p>積欠甘肅地極貧瘠、加以連年荒歉、赤地千里、往往應徵田賦等税、實際僅收六成、單以教育一項而論、兩年來積欠經費逹四三四、八二四元、計五個中學積欠爲一四七、一二四元、四個師範積欠爲一九四、八三五元、國内大學生補助金積欠爲一八、一八一元、留外生約三○、○○○元·尚有教職員月俸辦公設備等費、尚未列入、</p>
<p>補救據云、甘省因經費拮据、到處不免捉襟見肘、困難達於極點、不獨欲施改進之計劃、無從實現、且就目前加以整理、亦費躊躇、各校因經費太少、積欠過多之故、設備亦趨因陋就簡、依據大學教授資格條例第二十條、所附大學教授薪俸表内開、教授月薪四百元至六百元、副教授二百六十元至四百元、講師一百六十元至二百六十元、助教一百元至一百六十元、而甘肅學院最高薪俸、月二百四十四元、自然不能聘到有名教授、加以交通不便、生活枯澀、在内地月薪三百元、能聘到之教授、要往甘肅、聘就不行了、教授不好、學生程度亦隨之低下、故欲謀補救、首在提高教員待遇、以增聘有名教授、請發積欠、以添置應用設備、</p>
<p>返甘水氏謂本人此次晋京、卽係對上列諸問題、向教部有所請示、並携有改進詳細計劃草案、　呈教都、核閲批示、並有甘肅學院教授孫穉天、係率領甘省選手、參加全運南下、選乎早已返甘、孫則奉命考察江浙兩省藝術教育滯滬、聞已　事、不日卽隨水氏返甘云、</p>

<p>— 周瘦鵑</p>
<p>近來我常在做夢，常在做童年的夢，恨不能使年光倒流，仍給我回到童年的時代。爲甚麽呢？因爲童年總是幸福的，一張白紙也似的心中，從没有知道一絲一毫的憂慮。</p>
<p>可是童年已像流水一般的逝去了，逝去的流水不能挽回，所以童年也不能挽回。目前惟有和兒童們接近，和天眞的兒童們做朋友，覺得這是我心靈上唯一的慰安。</p>
<p>我編輯這春秋兒童週刋，已有十三期了。每一個星期六，我在選擇稿件從事編排的時候，倒像我自己也摇身一變，變了一個天眞的兒童，跳跳縱縱地到了兒童的園地上，伴着小朋友們打秋千；抽陀螺；説笑話；講故事。</p>
<p>今天四月四日，是兒童節，而今年這一年，又是我們規定的兒童年。這兒童年的兒童節，意義是何等的重大！我爲了表示尊重這兒童年的兒童節起見，特地把本刋全部開放，專載小朋友們的作品，借着小朋友們的靈心慧想好文章，</p>
<p>以貢獻於全國敬愛的小朋友，願大家努力！</p>

<p>— 蘇州景海小學周玲</p>
<p>日子好似巨輪一般，急急的轉着，殘酷的冬天，終於被温暖而美麗的春天壓倒。凡物也都很快樂地出來，來享受這温和的春天了。</p>
<p>那池旁的垂柳，都從它們的柔條上長出小小的嫩葉來。從碧緑的水中，也可以看到倒垂的柳條，它好似一個温柔的女孩子，没有發怒的時候。地面上枯黃的草，掙扎着，生出許多細芽來。夕陽西下時，總有一羣小孩子在草地上做着遊戲，講着故事。草好像是他們必要的朋友。</p>
<p>無數大大小小的燕子，都要成羣結隊的，經過海面，飛到這裏來，在人家的樑上做窼。有時飛出去，在那無邊無際的純潔的天空中飛翔着逍遥着。</p>
<p>春天到了，许多大大小小的花木，都含着花苞；有的没有開，有的已開出可愛的花來，供人們欣賞。那所謂耐苦勤愼的蜜峰姐姐，已嗡嗡的在花心中採蜜。恐怕這個好機會一去不回。所以忙着採了無數的甜蜜，帶回家去儲蓄起來。總之地面上一切飛的走的，都來歡迎這充滿了快樂的春天。</p>
<p>還有那春天的和風，是多麽温柔啊！</p>
<h3 id="c204">就不忘記了 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 上海華南小學韓曉霞</p>
<p>小笑話陶先生：［我每次在晨會上和你們講的話，你們都是從東耳朶聽進去，隨手就從西邊的一隻耳朶裏走了出來，總不肯把我的話記住，究竟是什麽緣故呢？·····你們這樣地没有記憶力，我眞没有法子了］</p>
<p>學生：［陶先生！我有一個好法子。］</p>
<p>陶先生：［什麽法子？你説説看！］</p>
<p>學生：［祇要把我們大家的西邊一隻耳朶，用字纸塞起來就好了。］</p>
<p>一陣陣吹動了水，水好像歡迎着風，微微流動。吹着了楊柳，楊柳先生摇摇擺擺，很爲滿意。吹到了人的身上，人也不由自主的温柔起來。吹在花上，一陣陣的香氣，剌入人們的鼻中。可愛的春天啊！不要回去，最好永久留在世界上，充滿着快樂的空氣，使世人終日終年，没有憂愁。春天啊！你辦得到嗎？辦得到嗎？</p>

<p>— 上海智仁勇女中附小譚學文</p>
<p>近來誰都説傑的性情變了。不错啊！從前傑的温柔性情，不知消失到那裏去了，現在他就像街上跑着的野孩子一樣。</p>
<p>雖然人們都説傑變壞了。但傑自己却並不覺得，他不過知道自己開始一個夢，一個和從前不相同的夢罷了。他現在所做的，是戰士的夢從前所做的，是好孩子的夢。</p>
<p>傑近來學會了閲報。他從報紙裏看出自己所處的國家，是怎樣的弱，這國家是不適宜於學好孩子的。這國家所渴望着的是强健的兒童，將來長大了會爲祖國打仗的兒童。</p>
<p>傑以爲每一個戰士都有着暴烈的性情。如果没有了這暴烈的性情，這人就不適合於打仗了。</p>
<p>所以傑併命去養成暴烈的性情，還有傑以爲每一個戰士必須要有殘酷的性情。如果戰士不殘酷，他們又怎敢捧着敵人的頭而歡笑呢！於是他也就先殺些昆蟲，像蝴蝶，偷油婆，之類丨拿他們來試試自己的性情。</p>
<p>家裏的人們都恨極了，傑因爲他們覺得傑太殘酷了，而傑自己郤很得意。</p>
<p>傑雖然也有些不大高興，因爲家裏的人對他没有從前的親熱。但他自己安慰着自己，他想他將來總要變成一個戰士，無論家裏的人對他怎樣。</p>
<p>於是他開始想學趙子龍，那百戰百勝的趙子龍，整天的吵閙。但是這更使家人們恨他，他們説傑越變越壞了。</p>
<p>但傑始終不覺悟，不明瞭家人們對他的態度。</p>

<h3 id="c208">西安的烏鴉會報時 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 西安一師附小馬振華</p>
<p>自從暮假來到西安，每天將要黃昏的時候，總可以看見不見其數的烏鴉，滿天的飛着，呌着，找它的宿所。第二天早晨，又是整着隊，亂噪着起身。那時睡的正好，被它吵醒，不免有些討厭，心中總説那裏來的這許多的烏鴉呢？同時也並不注意，誰知他有用呢　　從進了認校，這才明白它會報時刻的。在這一學期，全仗它天天按時呌醒，凖時到校上課。小朋友們聽了這話，覺得希奇嗎？容我寫出來，諸位一看就明白了。</p>
<p>在西安，是没有標凖鐘的，每天公家雖敲大銅鐘，報時也未必凖確。所以家家户户的鐘點，多不一律，相差很多，自然學校和家中的鐘，也就不同了，無法使之一致。學生上學去，難免遲到，我的家長特地將鐘撥快，也是補救不了　　隔了幾天，我們老師，宣布一種辦法，令我們早晨，注意聽烏鴉呌，呌第一次，就起床，呌第二次由家起身，呌第三次就到學校。</p>
<p>當時我不相信，烏鴉會有報時的能力，老師旣然説了，只得遵守。每天留神烏雅呌　丨西安的烏鴉，不在樹上搽窠，夜晚宿在屋脊上，所以家家都有，呌起來，聽的很眞切，凖可把人吵醒。</p>
<p>於是我的母親，專心給我聽着，烏鴉一呌，就把我唤醒，穿衣下地，草草盥漱一下，挾起書包就往外走。這時烏鴉，果然呌第二次了，跑到學校。將呌三遍，如此的繼續下去，不久便成了習慣，永没有遲到而誤了功課，這可證明它確能報時了。</p>
<h3 id="c209">可憐的老人 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 上海華南小學俞昭華</p>
<p>有一次，我在鄉村看見一個老人，龍鍾的在路上慢慢的走着。我問他道：［你這種樣子，還要到那裏去？］　　那老人家嘆了一口氣道，我是去砍柴的。我説，［你這樣老，還能去斫柴麽？］他説，［我是没法可想，我一天不去砍柴，便一天没有飯吃。］他説着，立刻流下了眼涙。］</p>
<p>我便問他爲什麽不呌你兒子去砍柴呢？他説：［我的兒子很不要好。他每天把我買來的錢，去吃酒賭錢，他還有一個老婆，也要我養活伊呢！·····］</p>
<p>唉！這老人的命運，也算是悲慘極了。我聽到這裏，兩眼的滬水也不覺奪眶而出。這時老人也在哭，不能再説甚麽話，我也没有勇氣去再問他，就在這悲哀的當兒，那老人就不辭而去了。</p>

<h3 id="c210">羊和狼的故事 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— 上海民智中小學汪澤長</p>
<p>在東方有一片肥沃的田地，長滿着嫩碧的青草，那裏住着一羣柔和的羊，它們每天吃吃青草，過着快樂的日子。</p>
<p>突然間東隣來了幾隻殘暴的狼，狠狠地注視着羊，要拿他們當點心，羊便派了代表，向狼的領袖苦苦地哀求道：［狼先生呀！天生萬物，當互相親愛的，我們羊素來主張和平的，你們爲什麽這樣殘忍呢？］狼的領袖聽了冷笑道：［嘿！和平！和平！委實是一個很動聽的名詞，但是顧了你們的和平，却餓了我們的肚皮。］於是，一會兒，幾隻狼便把一羣愛和平而不抵抗的羊，撕撕剥剥的吞食了。</p>
<p>從這故事裏，我們可以得到一個教訓和啓發：羊以和平來感化狼，結果是失敗，若是一羣羊能從圑結抵抗上去求和平，也許它們的命運不至這樣慘酷吧！要知道現在世界上，一切都没有公理，公理就是强權，惟有奮鬥才能得到最後的勝利呀！</p>

<p>木兒在十二歳的時候，他的父母爲着環境所迫，事實不許他繼續求學。爲了要養成他將來自立起見，他的父母，費了半年的光景，托人找到上海一　店舖，送他去做學徒。木見是一個很聰明的孩子，不到一年的工夫，已知道店中的一切事務，他的先生很稱讚他勤懇。</p>
<p>光陰好似流水般的過去，木兒已十五歳了，他已由學徒而升爲夥友。可是他的師兄們，都是歡喜以賭錢消遺，久而久之，近朱者赤的木兒，也變成一個喜賭的孩子。因此他欠了不少的賭債。</p>
<p>某天的上午，木兒偷竊了某一個師兄的一隻金戒指。及到後來發覺，他早已變化了錢。經過長時期偵查，卒爲一個同事所獲。</p>
<p>店主爲正店規起見，當卽把偷竊的木兒開除，所偷的戒指，由他父母賠出。可是他的名譽，已不能回復了。</p>

<p>世界上甚麽是最寳貴的，我想大家都知道的，就是，我們個個人都有的腦和手。爲甚麽呢？因爲腦能思想，能發明，手能寫字，能做事，假使没有思想，便没有發明，没有發明，我們的社會便不會進步。思想不靠文字傳布，發明了没有人去做，我們的世界，更不會這樣燦爛。</p>
<p>我們每個人都是有這兩件寳貝的。但我們雖然有了這兩件寳貝，必須利用它們，否則還是不要的好。</p>
<p>我們利用腦和手的方法，只有多讀書多學習，因爲多讀書，能使我們的頭腦靈敏，多學習，能使我們的雙手萬能，所以我們在幼時，非讀書學習不可。</p>

<p>— 工部局新閘小學劉寳珍</p>
<p>我的弟弟祖順，今年五歳，天資聰敏，爸爸在公餘的時候，教他識字，從四歳的時候識起，到今年識得一千多字，個個字都能講解，固然是因爲天性聰敏的原故，也是我爸爸的教授法子好。我今寫將出來，以作家庭教育的參考。</p>
<p>爸爸教弟弟識字，先從名物字教起，據爸爸説：［名物時常看見，可以容易記憶。］所以在没有教授以前，爸爸先將物件，使弟弟認熟後，再將物的名字，寫給弟弟認，只要教二三遍就可以認得。這種法子，簡單易行。若是教授形容或理想上之字，先教説話，使先了解意思，然後再寫字給他認。所以我弟弟不論識任何種類的字，都很容易認識。我今將這個教小兒識字的方法，寫出投於春秋兒童週報，貢獻於我們的小朋友</p>

<p>似乎這代的睡獅醒不回來了，然而總該摇醒現在的小睡獅啊，現在的小睡獅便是次代的國民目前的兒童，我國民族的復興，全恃今日的兒童，希望今日兒童，不再像我們，這樣的睡不醒，這樣的不如人，這樣的不中用，從小就該重視他們的幸福。兒童幸福的基礎當建築在健康身上。只有健康的兒童才有眞正的幸福，只有幸福的兒童才負得起救國的重任。我以爲兒童年最近的目的在求獲得兒童本身的幸福，兒童年終極的目的要達到民族復興，這兩點我們該抓住着不可輕易放過。</p>
<p>健康是幸福之門的鑰匙，有了這鑰匙，什麽艱難都有解决的辦法，也許從此不會怕洋鬼子了，從此不會怕飛艇坦克車了。本來［三等體格的國民，造不成頭等的國家］，本來［一個文化的黃金時代，三十年前必有一個國民健康的黃金時代］，前者係英相喬治説的，後者爲美心理學家霍爾講的，這兩句名言，都是事實的反映，我們該思之重思之。　　健康的意義在使個人有豐富的生活及能有最大的貢獻。兒童健康須從［飲食］、［運動］［休息］三大事下手幹起。［民以天爲食］，食是最緊要，可是食不得其法，丨食的過多或不足食非其時食非其物丨兒童發育不免將受阻碍，所以飲食要自幼當心，有的父母好像體面似的向衆説，［我們的寳寳不喜吃青菜豆腐］，其實兒童心喜吃青菜豆腐，卒致受到如此暗示，欲吃不吃了，殊不知菜豆爲營養的至寳，很多的兒童落在莫明其妙的手裏，不知糟塌了多少。</p>
<p>專事談吃而忽略運動，呌作白吃，吃得討不着好，接着還要講運動，筋肉時時活動，可增進有機體發育力。同時，姿勢，消化，排洩以及精神上，也裨益不少。賢明的成人應指導他們每天排出二三小時在新鮮空氣裏太陽光下興趣盎然地運動。走跑，拔河，跳繩，打拳，爬山，游泳，踢鍵子，滾鐵環等都屬不化錢的運動。現代的家長該洞悉兒童天性好動，而且應該給他們動，莫再奬勵兒童穿了長袍馬褂，不許動，不許説，一百個［不］字，拘束那活潑潑的兒童，動彈不得，裝出［少年老成］的架子！救救他們吧，讓他們任性活動吧，留得他們將來［老當益壯］的精神，爲這老大民族掙扎。</p>
<p>整天的吃，玩，作事，一些得不到休息，還是美中不足，故兒童疲倦了應有休息。休息係有機體的天然要求，做了二三十分鐘事，便該休息片刻，現有提倡小學教學時間不得過四十分鐘，每課休息要在二十分鐘以上，這裏却值得研究的。睡眠也可包括入休息項下，兒童年齒尤小，睡眠時間該尤多。普通兒童該開窗睡十三至十一小時，睡眠是帮助生長。修補細胞，恢復精神，越喜睡的兒童，越是健康的兒童，越是快樂的兒童。甚望家長們加以留意。</p>
<p>摇摇籃，摇醒小睡獅，摇的精疲力　，直摇到獅子怒吼。</p>

<p>— 吳志堯</p>
<p>新近某著名文學雜誌上有一位作者曾這樣描寫他的理想國的景况：</p>
<p>［城市像個公園，大樹的濃陰護着雜花。整潔的道路上，看不見一個狂的男人，妖的女人，和污穢的孩子，上學的，上工的，個個腆着胸走，容光唤發，用着掩不住的微笑，互相招呼，似乎人人都彼此認識。］</p>
<p>［藍天　去，星光漸生，孩子們都已在温　的床上，大開的門户之下，在夢中向天微笑］。</p>
<p>是呀，有這樣一個安樂的社會，才會有這些享福的孩子。</p>
<p>社會的中堅是成人，成人的生活爲無數因　的習慣所　。他們爲了傳統的，利害的關係仇視同類，虐待女人，看不起孩子。種種錯誤和罪惡，弄到人的現實的生活非常苦痛，大家都向着渺茫的未來與理想追求。</p>
<p>可憐的孩子們，有的甚至於没有出世以前，在他們的細胞裏已有着罪惡的成分，到了人世，更使他們終身　着不治的痼疾，或者，受着苦楚的　　，不得不卽速終止了他們的生命。</p>
<p>雖然大部份的孩子，被人們稱作［天眞，］可是，他們的［天眞，］一面爲人們稱頌，一面又爲人們殘　。　忽間，黑油油的雙眼帶上了一層昏黃了，呌呌喊喊的口子説上了一套他們自己也莫明所以的話了，乎和足也被鎖起來了，成人説，［這孩子已經受了教育了。］</p>
<p>現在雖有人大聲疾呼着要救救孩子，然而他們似乎忘記了孩子們所依存着的社會。有怎樣的社會才有怎樣的孩子，要救救孩子先要救救這社會。如其以愛護兒童，改善兒童的生活當作改造成人生活的第一步的覺醒，用這眼光來看兒童節，似乎是比較的更有意思。</p>

<p>— 味荔</p>
<p>ＸＸ：</p>
<p>這半個月以來，廣州市有兩件值得注意的事情：祀孔和祭關岳。朋友，你是讀書人，對於祀孔自然很關心，所以我現在不憚煩地把這事報告你。</p>
<p>朋友，你一聽到祀孔，心裏恐怕想這裏的孔夫子比别地方的孔夫子威風些罷，其實一樣晦氣，他老人家也是許多年［不知肉味］了，他的大殿早已改作兵房。他這次忽走紅運，確出於他意料之外。有人説中國是世界上一個最神秘的國家，這話許是眞的。</p>
<p>自從三月十七日丁祭消息公布後，一般孔教徒莫不喜形於色，他們巴不得日子快到，好去至聖先師面前頂禮，尤其是那些愛看熱閙的廣東人，想趁這個機會到孔廟瞻仰瞻仰。但是結果他們非常失望，祀孔那天早晨，廣府學宫門前，憲兵警察步步放哨，非薦任以上官員或教育機關代表不許進去。　　不佞以大學教授的身份幸而被許進去了。一進大門就看見一對黃紙糊的大燈籠，上面貼着［釋奠典禮］四個紅字。進了二門，又是一對燈籠，寫着［肅容］兩字。大成殿的甬道兩旁擺着許多時花盆景。大成殿前左右各豎着一個大火把。殿内正中供着至聖先師孔子神位，上面襯着一個［萬世師表］大横額。神前燈一盞，大香三枝，花燭一對，香爐一個。祭桌舖着白布，上面擺些錫香案，幾樣古式的祭器，一副三牲丨牛，羊，豕。</p>
<p>大約早晨四點多鐘的時候，主祭的人都到齊了。這是廣東省主席，他是正獻官。這是教育廳長，這是財政廳長，他們都是分獻官。稍遠一點，我們看見廣州市市長正和廣東省會公安局局長在那裏談天，他們也是分獻官。照規矩，祀孔他們本没有份，可是事有凑巧，建設廳長怡是省主席自兼，而民政廳長正出巡未歸，所以分獻官只有改推他們兩位擔任，道是多麽榮耀的職務！還有崇聖祠的主祭官，贊獻官和别的陪祭官也都已經到了，他們在人　裏面擠來擠去。</p>
<p>這次祀孔儀式，早經政務會議議决，原則是：［精神方面</p>
<p>已規復業崇聖典章，而形式方面，仍不背現行禮俗］。關於服裝，正分獻官都穿大禮服，陪祭官穿常禮服。其次，祭的時候行鞠躬禮，不行跪拜禮，因爲這早已不時髦了。但是最困難的問題是樂舞，古調似乎很久没有人彈了，而且［佾生］也不是在短期間内可以訓練起來的。變通辦法，請本市一個國樂研究社來奏樂助興。至於祝版獻帛獻爵受胙：等儀式都一律照舊，表示復古的意思。大約上午五點鐘光景，莊嚴隆重的祀孔典禮遂告閉幕。</p>
<p>關於這次祀孔的意義和牠的影響，廣州民國日報三月十七日社論講得非常透澈，我現在摘錄一段，作爲這篇通信的結束：</p>
<p>［民國肇造。喪亂頻仍。日尋兵戎。未遑文治。重以異説之朋興。人心之偏激。禮義廉恥。蕩然無存。····嗟夫嗟夫。莊嚴璀璨孔廟。肅雍駿奔之祀典。廢墜蓋不知幾何年矣。陳總司令痛國難之日深也。人心之日泊也。彼邪淫惛之日恣。而大道且陵夷澌滅以盡也。····用是不避非難。於舉國泯棼。狂迷沉　之餘。毅然提请各校讀經。又復重刋孝經。親爲之序。····且於本日實行上丁春祭矣。漪歟休哉。挽大海之廻瀾。肅萬民之觀聽。父老嘆漢官之復見。百家騰躍而知歸。非我陳總司令抗心希古。獨具淵衷。孰能與於此乎。］</p>

<p>— 白燕</p>
<p>整理書笥時，所從書本中落下一張久遠以前的小荷的照片。這失去很久的照片，不想在無意中又重復的出現了。我如同舊雨重逢似的把它緊緊地握在手中，凝神地端詳着：那圓圓的眼球，彎彎的眉峯，小小的櫻口，淺淺的笑渦，以及配置得頗爲匀凈而惹人憐愛的圓臉，無一不深切地唤起我以往的回憶。</p>
<p>已經是多少年了，彷佛也是這樣的一個春天，當梨花滿樹的時候，東風吹送着草芽的幽香，初熱薰得人有些昏暈。那時，我軟軟地倚在屋前的肥莢樹下：捧着一册紅樓夢，如痴如醉的看着。當看到；</p>
<p>［紛墮百花洲，香殘燕子樓；一圑圑，逐隊成球。飄泊亦如人命薄，空繾綣，　風流！草木也知愁，韶華竟白頭。嘆今生，誰捨誰收？嫁與東風春不管，憑爾去，忍淹留。］</p>
<p>就不禁默默地吟哦起來。我正全神凝注着書上，不知在什麽時候，小荷也走來了。這是當我偶爾回轉頭去，才發現她正蹲在距我不遠的草地上，手機械地撫弄着青草，俯着頭，正沈浸在冥想中　　［喂！小荷：］我輕聲的唤。</p>
<p>她没有答話，祇略將頭抬了抬，仍復垂下去弄着青草。</p>
<p>於是我便將書捲起，輕快地走向她去。一面説：［小荷！你怎不理我了！］一面便並着她蹲下。但她却驀然將頭撇開去。</p>
<p>［小荷！你怎的不理我？］我憤憤地問，並用手揉着她的肩搏。</p>
<p>［理你啦！］她將身軀扭了扭：瞅着我説。</p>
<p>［那末，爲什麽我唤你，你不應呢？］</p>
<p>［我没聽見。］她俯下頭笑了。</p>
<p>［好！你裝得眞像，我現在再重唤過。［我也笑着，便故意大聲唤：</p>
<p>［小荷！小荷！·····］</p>
<h3 id="c223">南口旅行追記（上） <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 何杰</p>
<p>那回到南口去了一次，其動機可並不是［投　從戎］，其結果也不是帶回美麗詩章若干篇，寓勇武於柔麗之中：乃是因爲住在北平，　那個地方不遠，不去一次有點説不過去。再説，若不早去，也許一年二年之後，想去時，還得辦個出國護照，那可更够麻煩。於是乘彼良時，就去了一趟。</p>
<p>有人説，在中國旅行是自找苦喫，在先，這話我就没有敢否認：去了一次南口，更增加了心中的堅信。</p>
<p>在西直門車站上了車，過了規定的時候十五分鐘，火車纔慢慢動着。可是還没有走出去：猛然又停住了。只見穿制服的鐵路員工鼓起大嘴巴來吹哨子，肩了槍的武裝同志跑來跑去。</p>
<p>又停了十分鐘纔走，後來知道原因是一位圑長老爺，遲到十分，火車不得不恭候。</p>
<p>車走起來，車廂兩面摇蕩，心中惴惴自危。看見坐在椅子上的老人，抽着旱烟，怡然自得的樣子，纔　得自己的大驚小怪無來由。他們慣了，一慣萬事安，用不着担心。漸漸我也忘了或有的危險，因爲我們男女老少十五人是站在那裏，雖然前後左右擠滿了人，不致跌倒，但長立腿酸，全部的腦子都只想如何得一個座位。</p>
<p>座位没有得着，就那麽站到昌平。</p>
<p>總算上天保佑，走了百十里路，看了一遭明陵，晚間平平安安到了南口車站。住宿的地方是南口旅館，　走近門前，就有粗壯的聲音　起來：</p>
<p>［站住！］</p>
<p>黑暗中看不見什麽，只見手電筒一亮，一個黑影朝我們走過來，原來是一位武裝同志。</p>
<p>一個人和他説我們是北平來的，南口旅館訂妥了房。他纔又把手電筒在每個人的臉上晃了一晃，允許我們進去。</p>
<p>［進去了，可就不許出來，干係大，聽見了麽？］</p>
<p>武裝同志用訓話的语氣説。不好回答，只有低着頭向裏走的分兒。到了住宿的地方，床少不足用，交涉之餘，纔知道許多架是衛國衛民的同志拿去用了，我們只好兩個人睡一架，每人應納房金一元。</p>
<p>管它那些個呢，一日的疲勞使人倒頭便睡，到睜開眼時，天已亮了。</p>
<p>［唔唔唔唔唔···！好吧！我現在已應你了。丨同喊魂似的。］説末句話時，眉頭微皺了皺。</p>
<p>我見她這樣，當時便冷冷地説：</p>
<p>［你不高興我唤你是不是？］</p>
<p>［高興啦！］有點不耐煩似的。</p>
<p>她這異樣的態度，使我沉默了。我動也不動地凝視着她心頭微微感到不快。相對地沉默了五分鐘光景，她忽而昂着頭注視我，遲疑地説：</p>
<p>［我告訴你！］但驀然又頓住了。</p>
<p>終於仍垂下頭，彷佛自語地説；［不，我還是不説的好。］</p>
<p>但我對於她這躊躇的行爲，却不免引起了懷疑，便再不能忍受地用手摇撼着她的軀體。像强迫又像懇求似的说，</p>
<p>［不，小荷！你一定要告訴我。］</p>
<p>［我告訴你是可以，但你可不能對旁人説。］她迂緩地説。</p>
<p>我默默地點了一點頭。於是她將身軀更挪近我些。忸怩地撅着嘴説：</p>
<p>［今天張家婆婆到我家來替我説親。］</p>
<p>（聲音有些含糊。）</p>
<p>［你媽答應嗎？］我焦灼地問。</p>
<p>［我不曉得。］她咬着上唇迷糊地答。並垂下了頭撫弄着衣角。</p>
<p>我聽後惘惘地，心上好像驀然蒙了一層陰翳似的。帶着病者憂鬱的眼定在她那撫弄衣角的手上，木然不動。</p>
<p>過了一霎時，我躊躇地聲音略帶點顫抖説：</p>
<p>［我媽不是曾向你媽説，要你做媳婦麽？］</p>
<p>［那是説着玩的。］她迅速地接着説，</p>
<p>［我媽説，像我們這樣的人家，怎好同你們對親！···就是能，可也没錢赔嫁啦！］</p>
<p>於是我復默然了。似流水般的寂靜佔據了我們的週圍，空氣也似乎死寂了。不多時，她便被她媽唤走了。</p>
<p>啊！已經是多少年了丨現在望着她的倩影，舊日的柔情，不覺又重復回到我的腦際。我頽然坐在籐椅中，垂着眼睛回想着···</p>
<p>書　終於没有整理好，却惹了滿懷愁緖。</p>

<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>把這兩個日子放在一起，這可是什麽意思？是感謝友邦的盛情麽？不然，是低三下四地向友邦討好麽？二年了，是的，道二週年是使人不忘的，足輕易埋没不了的。二年來這關東大路，淪落到比從前更深的無底的深淵裏，彷彿那光明的日子，避到遠遠的地方去了。一個以王道主義治國的國家，一年來統治的各地兵變民怨，無論在城裏或是鄉下，人們的生計，比從前更艱難到千百倍。説是感謝友邦的盛情，那其實也盡够了，他們友邦人士，不正是憑藉軍部的武力，到處强佔人家的土地麽，欺壓良民麽？他們還可以作出好多説不出口的，違犯國法的壞事情，然而他們究竟是友邦的人，國法是不能上身的，這就憑空地給他們添出一種特權，够了，不想了，不看了，越想那些事情越生氣，越看眼前的字跡越心急，丨丨什麽時候，這裏才能够恢復自由呢？</p>
<p>繼續走着路，到蒙古旗胡同口，讓前面一堆人把我擋住了。</p>
<p>［什麽事呢？］</p>
<p>一面自己問着自己，一面就走到人堆前去，人們目光所集的地方是一個警察和一個秃頭的女瘋子。站了一會，從人們的談話中，知道事情的發生，是由於警察要那間小舖子掛國旗，舖子裏的男人上市買菜去了，恰巧這瘋子女主人來接待警察的命令，不知怎的，總不外是話不投機罷，兩方面就衝突起來。瘋子的臉上流出好幾條血跡，自然是警察下的毒手，可是她也眞英雄，儘在不住地破口駡着她的敵手：</p>
<p>［警察狗！你好！你打人！我跟你算賬！］</p>
<p>警察大模大樣地叉着雙手，歪着頭，嘴裂的像一只瓢，不時地［哼］那麽一下，像是把他的高貴的身分擺給一帮看熱閙的人看的。似乎還含着你們也不能把我怎麽樣］的氣概。</p>
<p>新國家的警察，自從月薪增多了一塊國幣票之後，人人都異乎尋常地盡着職分，賣着氣力，尤其是對於一般　苦的人們，更會擺着罕有的威嚴，他們這些人，宛若忘去自己原也只不過是一個亡國奴，是帝國主義的一個走狗而已。</p>
<p>我不願再多躭誤時光，就從人羣中擠了過去，不過，我可以推想到，事情的結果，吃虧的怕還是那個瘋子，當然是那個瘋子！</p>
<p>看到學校的大門了，兩桿大旗，日本國旗，［滿洲國］旗交叉着掛在門口，因而那寫着［吉林省立女子中學校］的横匾，被旗身掩蓋着只露出中間的三個字。預備鐘響了起來，一下接一下地　得我加快了脚步，當我怱忙地走到學校裏的時候，同學都閙哄哄地正在排隊，説是要到運動塲裏去開會。我悄悄地溜進人羣中，訓育主任只注意到紊亂的人羣，因此没有發覺到我的遲到。看看排隊的同學們，少有人托出一副笑臉，説是預備去開慶祝會，誰都不大相信，她們的心裏，像是有一件放不下的心事在攪擾着。</p>

<h3 id="c246">［回到自然］ <a href="#c246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— 瓊聲</p>
<p>處此日薄　　的社會，人們的企求享樂陶醉可請達於極點，許多跳舞　遊戲塲密　之盛極一時無論矣，單就負有社會教育使命的電影言，也普遍的以香艶肉　爲呌座的號召力。遠之有提倡裸體運動的［健美的女性］，據云吸引了成萬的觀衆，繼此風猷，最近又有［回到自然］與［健美運動］二片的公映。廣告上甚麽裸　運動大寫眞，澈底研究人體美，破題兒第一遭，幾乎是繪聲繪影的吹捧，而所謂［春光明媚，切莫把青春辜負］，［及時行樂，樂何如之］等語句，更竭盡勸誘的能事。</p>
<p>以提倡健美運動或者裸體運動爲護符，來滿足一部份人某一種慾望，正像　着趨於究落階層［我躬不悦惶卹我後］的態度，這就像一個人衰弱到壽終正寢前自暴頽喪的心理。目前影片商之以明星出浴大腿乳頭招徠，也正是投其所好，以求適合環境的反映。這一現象自然引得不少的道學先生摇頭歎息，可是畢竟有許多人趨之若騖，因爲牠的産生與風　，有其濃厚的社會經濟背景，非僅　於［世風日下，人心不古］而然也。</p>
<p>回到自然！現下許多倡導健美運動或裸體運動的人這樣的高呼，解除衣服的束縛，我們亦看見有不少倾慕裸體健美的摩登婦女這樣附合。究竟所謂裸體健美運動的本身，在此男唱女合之光怪陸離現象下，是否是一切冶佚淫蕩事件之根源呢？</p>
<p>健美運動，若不以取悦男子或以男性爲倡　中心的話，在以工愁善病林黛玉式的審美觀念的中國，原不失爲强健女子身體，并由此出發作增進婦女社會事業的活動。它所包含的内容，不僅限於女子身體的健與美，而且帶有婦女爭取社會地位及擺脱家庭負累的性質；在打破男子操縱經濟權的社會制度這一點上，恢復原始社會的兩性關係，也確乎可説牠具有［回到自然］的意義。至於所謂裸體運動，絶非如這病態社會中的提倡者及一般人所想健的，是一種生殖器的公開展覽，牠一方面是解除滿頭珠玉四肢鐐　的束縛，具有反對視女子爲玩物及羽毛主義的審美觀的旨趣，而另一方面則純據生理衛生及優生各方面的見地，以提高女子體質爲目的。如晒太陽光，洗海水浴，及其他各種户内户外運動，解除衣服的束縛，都有莫大的裨益。</p>
<p>這自然是以科學觀點言之而已。但是在目前女子肉體一方面是商品，一方又是［奇貨可居］的現社會下，健美運動裸體運動就成了一部份人［飽餐秀色］或達到某種野心的武器。這點不能單用性的衝動來説明，而是目前［有錢能買鬼挑担］的環境下，女子經濟處於附庸，社會關係處於奴役的地位所致。</p>
<p>這一［回到自然］的運動，據聞德國是鼻祖，巴黎有裸體　，美國方興末艾。中國呢，一提到這一事，在我們人們腦裏，就如以前聽了社交公開男女同學一樣的神秘而加以排斥。本來生殖器官不是那麽神秘，神秘的乃許多［醉翁之意］的提倡裸體運動者。前傳這些人曾到香港上海來宣傳，時代的巨流眞太七顚八倒了，前幾年謡傳蘇聯實行裸體運動，某埠裸體遊行，曾經引起各國及我國衛道之士的非難，　鬼自疑的把　當洪水猛獸來反對，可是而今電影院以之大宣傳而特宣傅，竟自自己傚尤起來了。</p>
<p>然而這有甚麽希奇，在滿口道德文章之下，金瓶梅其實而西門慶其行的人，正復比比。</p>
<h3 id="c247">在兒童節想到的傷心事 <a href="#c247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— 心</p>
<p>婦女與孩子，在中國是向來被認爲不足重視的東西。近兩年來，觀聽似乎是劇形改變了，婦女有了婦女節，孩子也有了兒童節，這錯誤之認識，當然是件可喜的事情。</p>
<p>今年的兒童節又來了，社會的領導者都在熱忱地領導孩子們慶祝着這個可喜的節了。我的兒童時代是已經逝去了，不但不會像現在的孩子們因爲在這天有假放，有糖菓吃，有表演看，穿新衣裳的還可以大出風頭，不但對於我的那個時代只是留着好些不幸的悲慘的回憶，並且就是目前這個熱烈的兒童運動的時代，我對於咱們中國的兒童，亦只是懷着不幸的悲慘的暗影！這不是我好説掃興的話，實在現社會裏的孩子都被教成太不像話了，我先寫些事實來放在我們最敬仰的兒童運動者的面前。</p>
<p>我天天從辦公的地方回來，在我住的弄堂口（其實何只我住的這一處弄堂口？）總是有十來個孩子，呐喊奔馳地嘶殺着，這些孩子都是從學校裏放了學回來的。他們各人手裏執着一柄竹劍，或是木棒，一個比較活躍些的孩子，手裏拿的是一柄金屬的［寳劍，］有的戴着紙冠假鬚，腰間還緊緊地　着一根帶子，像［老戲］台上樣的，只是没有　鼓，但他們一邊假殺着，一邊口裏打着鼓鑼的聲音，眞是殺氣騰騰，好不威風，拿［寳劍］的孩子一定要佔上風的，其餘的就都假裝打敗了，跪在地上求降。於是這塲激戰才暫時停止下來。然而他們這羣是捨不得散去的，他們就靠着牆，或是坐在水門汀上，有的在牆上塗着［小五車］［小王八　］有的從褲袋裏挖出一本本方形的小　　來　　　　　　　　　，［　　一道白光，人頭不知去向！］［騰雲駕霧，在天空中鬥着法寳；一個縱身，來去得無踪無影］·····他們小口裏在唸着，手舞脚蹈地在躍着，好像神往地在放劍，騰雲，鬥寳了，形狀是奇怪得呌人笑着伸不直腰來。</p>
<p>我天天經過一段路去等電車，身後總是跟着幾個枯皮黃臉的瘦孩子伸着小手，口裏［發財老　］地喊着向來往的路人要銅板，當路人經意或是不經意地擲給他們一個子兒以後，他們就喜笑顔開地拾了子兒去［跳房子］了，頑皮些的男孩子拿着子兒到烟紙店裏去買香烟抽。　　有一次我在一個國内很著名的［學者］家裏閒談，那個［學者］的十二歳大的大少爺不知一忽兒爲了什麽發着少爺脾氣糾纏着［學者］的太太不放，太太依從着她的少爺，心肝寳貝的呼唤着，答應他去買一個從外國新到的黃頭髮碧眼睛的洋娃娃來給他玩，少爺還是不依，並且哭着閙着扯着［學者］的太太亂打，後來那位［學者］看惱了，就捉住少爺打了兩板小屁股，大聲喊汽車夫：［阿二，去把紅頭阿三喊來，把他賣到洋人那裏剜眼烏珠去！］這樣一來，少爺大槪眞的怕洋人剜他的小眼烏珠，就嚇得閉着氣躱在他的母親的懷裏，［學者］就做出一個無聲的鬼臉的勝利的笑。</p>
<p>這大槪不是杜撰的笑話吧，該是千眞萬確的傷心事吧！然而多着呢：看肉感的大腿跳舞，他們知道要坐在頭一排，看［回到自然，］他們會説［她們怎麽不回過身來？］他們還會替他們的母親們　十塊底的麻將，替他們的母親們買雙獨贏的跑狗票，并且會聽着音樂學他的父親跳交際舞，也會向他的母親説要某個好看的女孩子做他的老婆···等等。</p>
<p>這些傷心的事，對於目前的以至未來的中國，該是藏着很大嚴重性吧！在大家都一致喊着［救救孩子］的　　兒童節，我們應當怎樣着手去救這大羣的小生命呢？放一天假，開一個會，讓他們有糖菓吃，有表演看，有機會給穿着的新衣裳出風頭，···該不會這樣簡單的救他們了吧！假使是這樣的，那不是近於滑稽的欺騙？丨丨欺騙了領導者自己，欺騙了大羣可憐的孩子，只不過讓他們到了成人以後，深深地留着一個永遠不能磨滅的不幸的悲慘的回憶而已！］</p>
<p>在一張標榜着［救孩子，］名呌［生路］的影片裏，它也拿鐵般的事實來證明了我們救孩子的方法是錯誤得太不成話了！</p>
<h3 id="c248">［救命圈］等四劇觀後記 <a href="#c248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>春天來了，是最適宜於演劇的季節。近一月來，接二連三的公演，的確不少。自己是一個愛好戲劇的人，所以關於演劇的消息，總不免要打聽打聽。日前，聽説樂園在演劇，但因爲一時忙不過來，以致没有去看。當然得引爲遺憾。不過，人都是這樣的，已經有過一次遺憾，下一次必得當心，所以二日早晨看到了［中國婦女文化社主催春節話劇公演］的廣告之後，立刻决定晚上一定得去鑒賞一下。</p>
<p>假使有人問，［她們爲什麽要演戲呢？］那我以爲［幕前致辭］中已經寫得清楚明白。而且當你們看了當時的情形之後，你自會懂得她們熱情的可敬；假使你們没有看過的話，那末説來又有何用呢？</p>
<p>從各方面打聽得來，知道　一次公演又没有很好的凖備。這是中國的演劇運動最普遍的缺憾，也是目前急須解决的問題。關於這一點，我已説過多次，　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　救之方法。不過在這裏却不必詳論。</p>
<p>旣然有上述的實際情形，所以關於這次演出的一切，也就不必過於苛求。所以以下也只想一點不重要的意見。</p>
<p>這次一共是四個獨幕劇，除［救命圈］、之外，有［銀包］，［父歸］，［判徒］。比較的話，那末［救命圈］應當是成績最好的一齣罷。在這裏劇作者告訴我們，在目前，失業問題，已是最普遍而且最慘酷的現象。當然，他們最好辦法便是鬥爭的生活下去，但是也有少數消極的他們，却只有跳黃浦以死了之。不過殘酷的現實，甚至於使人没有死的自由，因爲這是和警察搗麻煩的。那末已經神經錯亂的失業工人，於是勇敢的打破玻璃取出那救命圈，因爲他以爲是足以救命的東西。誰知這也是和警察搗麻煩，他打破了玻璃是犯了刑章了。好罷，就是這樣，他不要你生，但是也不要你死；還有什麽好説呢？當那失業工人將被捉到監獄中去的時候，另外的一羣，却突然吼呌起來，而使他們警察走頭無路了。這是以喜劇的手法來寫悲劇，然而也是極易於成爲悲劇而失掉喜劇成份的。雖然那精神錯亂的失業工人的笨拙，未嘗不是可笑的行動。至於那個覺悟的警察，使人覺着生疏，至少是不够個性描寫。</p>
<p>不過這一個劇據説是上台三分鐘前改好劇本的，那末我就覺得很滿足了。第一次嘗考不一定十分成功。幾個主要主角色如失業工人或覺悟的警察都演得很生動，特别是［月亮上升］中極有成績的王瑛君，大有表演天才。</p>
<p>的确，這一劇演得還好。特别是它切合社會需要；當那覺悟警察告訴失業工人，鬥爭的生活下去的時候，觀衆　一片　聲，可見它深深的感動觀衆了。　　　　　　　。</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>其次，應當提到［銀包］了。關於這，我有一個極大的感覺，我以爲這種外面劇非完全改編不可。本來，這是一個很豐富的劇本，但是因爲其中　　　和我們的生活習慣不甚相同的時候，頗不易於討好。不，它在外國，它在觀衆水凖甚高的條件之中，未始不能獲得甚大的效果，但在中國却不免要打一個折扣。問題是在那重覆囌囌的對話，我們非使它清楚明白不可。加之，表演又不甚佳，於是乎它不被觀衆所理解了。其中以莎君最好，維克君次之，紅荳君又次之。不過，假使導演好的話，也許還可以更好一點兒罷。</p>
<p>［父歸］，對於我們可以説是非常熟悉的了。在菊池寛的劇本中，這是僅有的能够上演而且感情很豐富的劇本。它在目前，也許並不何等適宜，不過以往日的經騐來説，這是滿足中國人之味口的了。同樣，這一次演，雖然不見甚佳，可是我身旁的幾位小姐，却不住的流涙了。然而以這樣的倫理戲，在目前去騙觀衆的眼涙，到底是不大應該的吧。是不是？</p>
<p>這一個劇，我們看不到導演更適當的支配。而實際上，據説祗是上台以前對了一遍台詞而已。幸而演員都有經騐，所以還可以對付過去。</p>
<p>最後，關於［叛徒，］我不想説什麽，因爲根本就没有演完。總之，這一次演劇，並不曾得着完美的效果。不過，事先没有很好的排演，我是十分欽佩演員們之天才的。但是，話得説回來，天才這東西，究竟不是演員财産的全部啊。前進的戲劇家，應當儘可能愼重的忠實於自己的事業。敬祝他們努力！</p>

<p>買了一管李施得霖牙膏，另外得到了一個米鼠假面具。孩子似的戴上自己的臉，六歳的小妹妹嚇得哭了起來。</p>
<p>才從鄉下來的老姑母笑着駡：［幹嗎戴假面具？戴假面具的日子會有的罷？］</p>
<p>這是故鄉的一句俗語。意思是説戴假面具的是壞人。所以看到人們戴假面具就會加以呵止。</p>
<p>鄉中演戲，凡是戴假面具的總是壞蛋。這句俚語也許就由此而來的吧！</p>
<p>然而，在這世界上的人，那一個没戴上奇醜可佈的假面具呢？只消我們稍微加一些注意力在這社會上，我們到處可以尋到各種不同的面具。戴了笑的面具在心心裏哭，戴了哭的面具在心中笑。千奇面怪，整個的世界都在假面具中生存着。</p>
<p>只有對待用人，黃包車夫或乞丐之類的人們時的面目是人類眞正的面目。　　要獲得地位，非戴上假面具不行；要得到滿足，非戴上假面具不可。在這世界上，假面具的用處之大超過任何一切。</p>

<p>丨討論二</p>
<p>編者先生</p>
<p>社會制席的不良，人民的生活不能充裕，以致一切的慾念，都不能如願以償；更兼外界物力的引誘，使每一個物質不足的青年，都陷久苦悶的界境。</p>
<p>由於苦悶的起因，會使你不自振作，走入頽廢之途而不克自拔。</p>
<p>在我早年約丨二十歳的時候，也就犯了這個毛病：天天抽大烟，上賭塲，逛窰子，不當一回事。那時候的思想眞奇怪，這樣作，算是［樂死派］又算是［慢性的自殺］。但裏面也充滿着絶大的矛盾性的，在財源缺乏的時候，還想掙扎，以苟延殘息，那末只有以少數的錢去博取多數的錢，於是上摇寳檯，牌九塲去賭，萬一輸完的時候，又到處去設法錢。直到現在還有人説起：［以前你眞荒唐呵！］</p>
<p>現在撇開旁的不談，使我日夜憂疑的梅毒，有一天果然發覺了，下部剌剌作痛，怪難受的，我知道這並不是梅毒，而是淋毒性的症候。</p>
<p>至於病中的痛苦，果如鍾君谷仁所説的除皮肉痛楚之外，還受到人們奚落丨起先我還秘密着不給人知道，何如步履維艱，終於給我的叔父知道了，於是他警誡和譏諷似的説：</p>
<p>［帶了收條回來啦！］</p>
<p>我只落得赤着臉説不出半句話。</p>
<p>我眞感謝我的叔父，他告訴我環境無論如何惡劣，不可以自暴自欺，把强健的體魄，毁滅於這種地方。你的身體受之於父母，卽不能爲大衆着想，亦當爲父母愛惜，［十月懷胎娘心痛。］生育汝殊非易易也。後來他爲我邀醫診斷費了半年的長時期，才把不名譽的淋病治愈，從此以後，我一心做事，不加妄想。華鐙初上，街頭之紅粉骷髏，再也不敢染指。</p>
<p>我説了一大套話，没有説到解除性病痛苦的方法。這的確是社會重大的問題。在好幾年前已經有人主張禁娼，事實告訴我，禁娼之後而不使之工作，免不了公娼减而私娼熾。現在唯一的捨本逐未的方法，祗求當局限止公娼，每星期内嚴加檢騐妓女之有否毒病？否則着令停止接客。</p>
<p>有爲的青年們，我希望你們還是潔身自好吧。設有性煩悶的時候，不妨運動讀書，藉資排解，是否有當，尚待高明者有以教我。此祝</p>

<p>三，政治</p>
<p>暹羅是没有什麽文化的，人民的智識也很低落，加以氣候炎熱，長年如夏，土地肥沃，農産豐饒，一切生活必需的衣食住，都很容易解决，他們旣無政治上的壓迫，又無經濟上的痛苦，除了躺在椰林裏拚命的享樂，還管他現在是什麽世界！所以無論現代的思潮變化到如何程度，暹羅還是一個世界桃源，可是歷史的車輪終究是向前邁進的，自前年以來，民權與君權的鬥爭，也開始在暹羅活躍了。</p>
<p>第一次政變，是在前年的六月，參與的大都是退伍的軍人和一部份在任的官吏，當發動的時候，大槪因爲王族方面没有凖備，所以子彈也没有費掉一顆，於數小時内革命竟告成功，民黨握政後，暹王仍没有去位，不過産生了一個國會，同時於短短的三數日中，趕成了一部憲法，於是，君主專制的暹羅，就一變而爲君主立憲的國家了。</p>
<p>去年的六月，暹羅又起第二次政變了，這次的主動者，是一班失權的王黨，他們的口號，是要打倒［宗旨無定，不能措理政務，任人民輕視王族之現在暹王］（以上是根據叛軍傳單上的話），另立［拍翁照母汪拉綠親王］，可是結果是失敗的，現在暹　的政權，實際上還是操在穏健的民黨手裏，最近，聽説又有新的醖釀，今後暹國的政局將變化到如何程度，那就非我們局外人所能推測的了。</p>

<p>— 滄桑</p>
<p>雙方接近確有可能</p>
<p>馮史都漢有赴俄説</p>
<p>近自美國與蘇俄恢復外交關係之後，俄國對於美國影片及影片市塲的興味，又在不一而作了。在蘇俄電影界裏，到處可以聽到導演家和編劇家談論此事，他們以爲取材於蘇俄的劇本定能使美國人感着趣味，他們且把已成的劇本不時向僑居蘇俄的若干美國人探詢意見。至於俄人的如此興奮，却因爲美國影片商人的突然對俄活動有以致之。蓋自美國承認蘇俄政府之後，美國影片商的代表和函電卽一再的招攬蘇俄影片。直到最近始有進一步的合作表示。</p>
<p>但因爲好萊塢和蘇俄方面在從前試行合作的經歷上，彼此都感着很不能滿意，所以現在兩方面都無意積極進行。好萊塢方面深知蘇俄的編劇家决不願意抺煞蘇俄境内的共産生活，而另行創作的。因此美國的影片商如其渴望换换口味而又不願宣傳蘇聯主義，那末蘇俄私人方面的電影界人物祇有暫停活動，以待時機。如其美國影片商到俄與蘇俄政府方面的電影合作，亦將遭遇同樣困難。不過情形雖是如此，電影界内外的許多人物却信，俄人從前懷着蘇俄主義到好萊塢攝製影片，雖有種種失敗，在今日好萊塢和莫斯科獲得妥恊，確已很有</p>
<p>可能。</p>
<p>據俄人稱，美國影片商熟知俄國方面很有許多新頴的電影題材，利用美國的電影技巧，再以俄國的藝術學説，開發俄國的材料，一定可以獲得優美的成　。</p>
<p>莫斯科電影界聽到愛立克馮史都漢Ｅricuonstrcheim陳請蘇俄政府准其入蘇俄影片公司服務的消息，大爲興奮。俄人對於這位馮史都漢的藝術很表讚美，一致覺得，倘使他能到俄國，那末以他的天才及其在美國方面所得的經歷定有好結果的。</p>

<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>ＡＬＬof　Ｍe丨大光明</p>
<p>首先，我以爲這一影片最值得稱讚的，便是導演以極嚴肅的態度，而極電影藝術的表現手法。也許ＪamesＨood這個名字對於我們還很生疎，但是他演出的手法，却是非常驚人的了。</p>
<p>我以爲這一影片，應當當作我們參考的藍本。全篇是那末清楚明白。在極簡單的故事中做出那末豐富的戲。不嚕囌，不堆積，極簡潔明快的，將應當表現的或必須表現的，全部表演出來。特别是其中有三塲最精采的戲，我們不妨詳細的加以研究。</p>
<p>當影片開始的時候，導演佈景了一個極幽靜的塲面，爲的是要寫明男女主角之甜蜜的愛情。（一）夜，美妙的園林。俯攝的誆鏡頭，攝取那仰地而臥的男女。（二）男女臥地的中景。（三）鐘聲，鏡頭移出，花的Ｄisslove。（四）明月。（五）再重新回到男女主角之處。丨這中間寫出自黃昏薄暮至月亮上升。而一對愛人之間的甜言蜜語，便令人無限羨慕的活躍在銀幕上了。</p>
<p>當男主人翁憤然離開女主人之家以後，她坐在原地喝咖啡。母親進來，問：［忘麽了？他走了嗎］？［我不知道］。女兒悒鬱的回答。其後又是母親問：［那末價打算怎樣呢？］她答道：［我嗎？···我喝我的咖啡］。這是展開新的劇情之開始，就在這冷冷的幾句話中，充分的表現出女主人翁在失去了愛人之後的變態了。但是這還不够，在緊接的第二塲，導演是如下的描寫了她的内心。（一）女主人翁獨坐凝思。（二）女僕送早點入，女略進少許，旋令女僕移去。（三）女憂悒，不安，至窗前。（四）由窗前退回原處坐下。（五）母入，安慰女兒。（六）母出，女不安的靜默無語。（七）女僕授女一信，女令其打電話。（八）女打電話，手中有未折開的信。（九）信封正方面的特寫。（十）信的特寫。以下Ｄisslove到教養院。丨這一塲處理女主人翁的内心變化極佳。在靜的空氣中簡潔明快。</p>
<p>再要説到的便是劇的最高峯了。（一）快律動寫高樓之外景。（二）逃犯阿尼和其情人伊娃在室中憂慮而急迫的谈話。（三）有人在敲門，阿尼他們驚疑，不敢敲門。旋聞李姐之名，啓門使其入。（四）李姐授一皮包給伊娃，令他們速逃。（五）忽聞急迫的敲門聲，三人不知所措。阿尼與李姐趨至門邊。伊娃問門外爲誰，知爲捕捉阿尼之警察。（六）阿尼至窗前，凖備躍下，聞窗外街道上的騷音。其情人急抱住。（七）敲門聲愈急。騷音。阿尼向其情人解釋。（八）伊娃不置可否，漸失知覺。（九）阿尼一足跨上窗户，李姐在門邊，注視，旋大聲呼喊。（阿尼已躍下）街上噪雜的人聲。（十）街上警察的銅哨聲，救護車聲。李姐以手掩面。（十一）伊娃痴呆痛苦的表情，决心跳窗自殺。（十二）李姐倚門注視窗口，旋面壁呆立。街上噪雜的呼呌聲。（十三）警察破門入，捉李姐去。丨丨在這一塲中可以説充分的説明了作者的聰明。最值得注意的是，當第一個人躍下自殺的時候，由女主人翁口中喊出，第二個人躍下時，却以街道的人聲説明，兩次都不直接他們跳窗的姿態。至於後一次先寫李姐不忍看尤佳。更值得學習的，注意的是當時空氣製造，緊張密凑，無以復加。他如先寫房子的高度，却是先行告訴你跳窗自殺者必死。</p>
<p>好了，如上所述，導演手法，實足驚奇，加之幾個演員都演得極佳，就形式上説，眞是一個極好的影片。而錄音的清脆，攝影的美麗，尤其餘事。</p>
<p>現在我所要説到的是影片的内容了。</p>
<p>在這裏劇作者提出了變愛和結婚是否一致的問題。本來，這差不多是不容懷欵，而且是不值得特别提出來的。不過，劇作者却在先强調的提出了變愛不一定結婚。卽是説變愛是一回事，而結婚又是另一回事。當教授唐因事將遷居而要求其愛人同去結婚的時候，她説：［我所要的不是和你結婚，我所要的是愛你，永遠的愛你。···那是多麽不同呀！···（變愛與結婚）我以爲我們的愛情將由結婚而死滅。···］這裏充分的寫出女主人翁是一個變愛至上主義的空想者。到後來，劇作者在另外一對窮苦的夫妻身上，説明結婚以前，需要眞實的愛情，更需要相互間的充分了解。最後，他在男女主人翁口中告訴我們説：［我們現在到巴黎去休養一會罷］。女主人翁李姐回答説：［我們去罷，我們到西部去，這此時候，我完全改變了自己的思想了。］卽是説變愛應當有它的責任，結婚，生育兒女，正是變愛的最後階段，無可懷疑的。更進一步的説，當結婚之前，一定得有充分的互相了解而有了眞實愛情之後，雖爲變愛而殉情，亦在所不惜。</p>
<p>自然，這是非常投合小布爾喬亞之口味的了。眞變愛和結婚到底是建築在什麽上面的呢？這由於窮夫妻身上，我們是這樣想，他們是相互了解了，他們是眞實的相愛了，但是社會去不容許他們生活下去。雖然他們爲了將來的兒女還要掙扎着，可是法律的嚴酷，在所謂小偷的罪名身上，他們相繼自殺了。所以好的結果只有大學教授和小姐之間才能享受。也許，這是劇作者下意識的表現，不過我們却不免有如上的感覺了。</p>

<p>— 吉羊</p>
<p>家庭無綫電收音機，現在在中國各大都市都可以見得到。不久的將來，無綫電電影機也可以裝置在我們的家庭裏了。我們祇須把機紐一開，就可以在客廳裏很舒服觀賞一張愛看的有聲鉅片。現在美國紐約已經開始有了。聽説裝費大約一百二十五元美金，如果現在銀價抬高後，我們也祇要出一架五燈機收音機的價格，就可裝一座家庭的小有聲戲院了。這豈不是旣新奇而便宜嗎？</p>
<p>但是，因爲這樣的改變，恐怕電影界又要因此而發生劇烈的變化。第一在製片家方面，他們除了繼續製片之外，還要增設［發音］和［播影］的劇塲，當然他們的營業也是會增加的。第二，在影戲院方面，便要首蒙其害，因爲許多人都可以在家裏，或在火車，汽船，旅館等處自由的看賞影片，無須出房門一步，影戲院的營業當然要受一重大的打擊。第三，在觀客方面，他們可以不用［望眼欲穿］的去等候新影片，不過也有一椿缺點，便是該影片（播影的）是不能用外景的。這很可惋惜的，未知將來能否改善？第四，在演員，也有三種人要受影響的：（一）黃髮的人丨他們的顔色印在幕上是不清楚。（二）紅髮的人丨紅髮印在幕上是没有顔色的。（三）聲音粗糙的是要被淘汰的。據試騐結果，黑色和蒼白的面色，影出來是最好看。這麽一來，黑髮女郎如桃洛絲德里奥，瑙瑪希拉，史璜生，瓊克勞復業就會　着幸運。紅髮女郎，好克於萊寳，珍尼蓋諾，南錫卡羅等恐怕要被　棄了。</p>
<p>還有化裝術也要受影響的：唇脂要改塗藍色，搽粉要改白色，男角的塗的鬍子要改爲青膠或青粉。所以每一種事件，有利也有害，那僅是無綫電電影呢？</p>

<p>— 文印</p>
<p>隔了一回，瓊娜開口道：［哦，原來這是偉大莊嚴的康納萊大厦裏所做的事···都好呀，都名譽呀···惡毒到這樣···專門摧殘人家的人生的。好了，我不要你的地了。要這樣，我還要快快的逃走哩。這種人，我一生一世都不願意再見一面。］威爾站在門口，攔住了路不讓她走。他説：［瓊娜，你不必存那種心···那是過去的事，已經死掉的了···我們有我們的將來！］瓊娜慘然道：［你和我是没有什麽將來的。］威爾道：［我們有光榮的將來。我一切都預備好了。］瓊娜道：［我不相信。你從前告訴我你愛我···我亦不相信了。你還是回查爾斯頓去結婚去吧···］威爾狠狠地瞟了他母親一眼，然後對着瓊娜道：［瓊娜，全世界上我祇有一個人要和她結婚的！那就是你！］但是瓊娜很悲切地摇着頭道：［我不信讓我去吧。你的母親是對的丨她永遠是對的。她毁了我祖母一生的幸福，亦是對的。她阻止了你和我的結合，亦是對的。她把我從這個可怕的地方攆走，尤其是對的。她説謊話丨説你的叔叔死了丨當然亦是對的···］她話没有説完，突然外面傳進一種可怖的聲音，將她的話打斷了。吉拉婷喊道：［什麽事］？外面起了驚喊的聲音，祗聽見西皮奥的聲音道：［哦，上帝救救我吧！可憐的羅伯先生自殺了呀！］威爾和吉拉婷帶着恐恢往外跑，康納萊夫人倒在一張椅子裏，將雙手捧着頭。瓊娜看了她一回，然後慢慢地走開了。</p>
<p>一切的東西，都已綑紥好了，裝在一只箱子裏，瓊娜在那已經卸裝的屋子裏站着，四面看着，不禁悲從中來，眼涙　　掉了下來。一回兒，她又催促着她的小兄弟道：［傑克，快些，一回兒車了要來了。］當傑克蓋上箱蓋的時候，她看見了上次康納萊家裏開跳舞會的時候的穿的那件印花布衣服···那時不過多久一回兒呀！威爾···相遇得那樣容易丨而相失得又那樣快！她於是咬緊了嘴唇，不讓它發抖，一回兒她的大兄弟哈雷又問道：［姊姊，我們往什麽地方搬呀？］瓊娜幾乎要哭出來似的説道：［遠得很哩···］一輛破馬車已經來到門口。那個趕車的黑人，帮助瓊娜，哈雷和傑克將東西一齊搬到車子上，瓊娜的手是在瞎抓着，她的眼睛已被眼涙模糊了。忽然間在她旁邊一個人喊着她，使她嚇了一跳，那雜貨店的主人李却來了。李却的眼睛從眼鏡的上邊看着瓊娜愁苦的臉説道：［這有什麽意義呢？康納萊夫人不能拿你怎樣的呀。我已經查過法律，照法律上所説的，你可以在這裏住到下一次耕種的時候。到那時候，世界上的變化，還不知道怎樣哩。］瓊娜亦不答應他，她默然地再走到屋子裏，四週看着還有什麽遺忘的東西没有。（未完）</p>

<p>To Visit Chiang Kai-shek after Meeting, Then Proceed to Nanjing to See President Wang Jingwei</p>
<p>To Request Instructions on Dealing with the Situation in North China</p>
<p>(Beiping) This afternoon at 5:30 PM, Huang Fu, along with his secretary He Jiecai, advisor Ge Chongxun, and servants, departed from Beiping for Jiangxi. He will meet with Zhang Xueliang, Zhang Qun, He Chengjun, and others in Wuhan. From Wuhan, he will proceed to Jiujiang and then to Nanchang to visit Chiang Kai-shek. After meeting with Chiang, he will return to Mogan Mountain to pay respects at his ancestral graves. After a brief stay, he will proceed to Nanjing to meet with President Wang Jingwei, and then return north. The entire trip is expected to take about a month. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Qigong stated that Huang Fu's mission to the south is to report to Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei on the diplomatic situation in North China. The itinerary is planned for forty days. He intends to first visit Chiang Kai-shek in Jiangxi, stay for three days, then proceed to Nanjing to see Wang Jingwei. After a short stay in Nanjing, he will go to Hangzhou, then return to Mogan Mountain for a rest of more than ten days. According to sources, Huang Fu, due to the serious nature of the current situation in North China, after Tang Youren returned south, reported the actual situation in North China in detail to the central government. The central government believes that Huang's responsibilities are of great importance to the future, so it summoned Huang to the south to formulate a comprehensive plan. It is generally speculated that all issues related to diplomacy after Huang's trip to the south may see some intangible progress. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Huang Fu departed via the Beiping-Hankou Railway for Hankou on the afternoon of the 3rd, and will then proceed to Nanchang to visit Chiang Kai-shek. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chairman Huang of the Political Reorganization Committee has long desired to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to discuss important matters. At 5:25 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd, he departed from Beiping for Wuhan via a special train provided by the Beining Railway Bureau, and will then proceed to Nanchang. His confidential secretary He Jieren and advisor Ge Chongxun are traveling with him. In order to avoid farewells from various parties, Huang did not announce the departure date in advance. Many military and political figures only heard the news at the last minute and went to Xibianmen to greet him. Those who saw him off at the West Station included only Gao Shengyue, representative of the Military Affairs Commission, Mayor Yuan Liang, and a few others such as Yu Puhe and Shen Chang. It is said that after Huang finishes his business in Jiangxi, he will immediately go to Nanjing to report to the central government on the recent political and diplomatic situation in North China, and request instructions on future response policies. He may also take the opportunity to return to his hometown to sweep the tombs. The affairs of the Political Reorganization Committee will be handled by Secretary-General He Qigong. He is scheduled to return north in a month. (3rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Huang Fu took a special train to Wuhan from the West Railway Station at 5:25 PM this afternoon. Accompanying him were his wife and several secretaries, as well as more than one hundred guards. It is said that Huang plans to meet with Zhang Xueliang in Hankou, then go to Nanchang to visit Chiang Kai-shek, and then meet with Wang Jingwei in Nanjing to discuss matters. He plans to return to Zhejiang Province to visit his ancestral graves before the Qingming Festival. Many news reporters gathered at the station to inquire with Huang, but Huang was unwilling to make any statements. Therefore, it is still unknown when he will return to Beiping. Huang kept this trip strictly confidential, and it was not until after 5:00 PM tonight that it was known that he would start his journey tonight. The special train has been prepared since Friday. It was initially heard that Huang would go directly to Nanjing, but it has now been confirmed that he is going to Hankou. The purpose of this trip is of great concern to the people of Beiping, who generally believe that Huang will meet with Chiang and Wang to discuss the Sino-Japanese issue in North China, and it is expected that he will return to Beiping after the matter is completed.

At dawn today, the Shandong troops launched a surprise attack from three directions. The bandits, upon hearing the alarm, fled to Yucheng, thirty miles north of Ganyu City, and were already more than ten miles outside the province. The Shandong troops, Sun Tongxuan's and Gu Liangmin's columns, and Li Xuande's cavalry regiment, divided into three routes to pursue and suppress them out of the province. Wang Jun's regiment ambushed them at Qingkou. Li Shilong's brigade of Wang Jun's department blocked them near Xin'anzhen Station on the Longhai Railway. The bandits have no way to escape.

For incidents that deserve punishment, they should be given reprimands, demerits, salary deductions, or demotions according to the severity of the circumstances, and should not be dismissed lightly, so that cunning people cannot use minor offenses to achieve their goal of shirking responsibilities.

<p>Strike at Qixin Cement Company</p>
<p>The Coachmen's Union Has Been Established</p>
<p>The Situation at Huaxin Changed Again After Resuming Work</p>
<p>Zhao Dazhong Covertly Manipulating Power</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The labor unrest in Tangshan is becoming increasingly unmanageable. Workers at the Qixin Cement Company also went on strike at 6:00 AM on the 2nd. There were about two thousand workers. When they took over the shift, they posted slogans. The factories were full of slogans calling for the overthrow of the old union, the reorganization of the new union, and the increase of wages. The factory planned to report to the Tangshan Public Security Bureau. The bureau sent a team to rush there, but the workers had already stopped working, destroyed the main power gate of the lamp factory, and plunged the entire factory into darkness. Some of the workers held weapons and guarded the company's gate, prohibiting people from entering or leaving. The police were afraid of clashing with the workers and did not dare to enter rashly, but monitored outside the factory. The workers then gathered for a meeting and shouted slogans to overthrow the old union and demand increased wages and improved treatment. They elected Li Shuzhong, Wang Dianqing, Feng Guixing, Han Fengzhang, Li Zhongzhi, Jiang Luidong, Xu Xiuping, and Liu Caibin as representatives to form the Qixin Cement Company Branch of the War Zone Workers' Autonomous United Federation of Trade Unions. They immediately hung a wooden sign at the old union and began to work. The workers organized two maintenance teams, each wearing red cloth armbands with the words "Qixin Branch of the War Zone Union" written on them, and held sticks to maintain order in the factory. The workers went to work on time and were not allowed to leave their original positions without permission. For a time, the factory was quite chaotic. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The workers on strike at the Qixin Cement Company presented ten demands to the factory, the most important of which are: (1) Abolish the old union and recognize the new union; (2) Increase wages and improve treatment; (3) Share bonuses. The remaining conditions are largely the same as those of the Tangshan Mining Workers and the Huaxin Textile Factory workers, all of which were instructed by Zhao Dazhong. Currently, Zhao is covertly manipulating the power of the Tangshan Luanzhou workers' actions, so the key to solving the problem lies with Zhao himself. Zhao is a puppet of a certain country. After the Tangshan New Workers went on strike on the 2nd, they crowded the old union official Cui Chengye to the War Zone Association to seek Zhao Dazhong's decision. He was imprisoned for a day and released in the evening. On the morning of the 2nd, when the Qixin workers went on strike, they destroyed the flower-distributing factory and the machines of the factory, causing the company to suffer heavy losses. Currently, the capitalists have not expressed any opinion on the unrest. (3rd Electric Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Coachmen's Union of the War Zone was established on the 2nd and is located on Gudong Street in Tangshan. Zhao Dazhong was elected as the chairman. They are now notifying the coachmen to sign up and register. After the Luanzhou Mining and Tangshan Mining workers were dismissed in front of the Luanzhou Commissioner's Office on the morning of the 2nd, they held a meeting of worker representatives in the afternoon and decided to adhere to their consistent demands, requesting the mining bureau and the government to fulfill the conditions. Tao Shangming telegraphed to the province to report the current situation of the labor unrest in the three places and requested instructions. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 2nd, Tao Shangming telegraphed the Hebei Provincial Government, stating that he was trying his best to mediate the labor unrest at the Kailuan and Tangshan mines. From the 2nd to the morning of the 3rd, the workers took no action. Male and female workers at the Huaxin Textile Factory went on strike again at 8:00 PM on the 2nd. The workers declared that they would take the same actions as the Tangshan Mining and Qixin workers and that the authorities must have a solution for those two places before all three places could resume work together. After the Huaxin Textile Factory workers resumed work on the afternoon of the 2nd, they were pressured by the Tangshan Mining workers, so they changed their minds and went on strike again. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong returned to Tianjin from Beiping by special train at 4:30 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd. The heads of various agencies and bureaus of the provincial government all went to the station to welcome him. Yu Xuezhong told reporters that the Kailuan mining unrest must be fundamentally resolved. Currently, the Beiping Political Reorganization Committee and the provincial government have entrusted Tao Shangming to be responsible for mediation so as not to expand the unrest. We will then think of a thorough solution. The labor unrest at the Huaxin Textile Factory and the Qixin Cement Company is lighter than the mining unrest in Tangshan. Once the mining unrest is resolved, the labor problems at the two factories will not be a problem. Zhao Dazhong is a student of Zhao Xun, the Director of the Tangshan Public Security Bureau. He graduated from Beiyang University. He came to Tianjin with Zhao Xun to seek a position, which had already been approved but not yet announced. Suddenly, he joined the mining workers' activities. What is his intention? No detailed report has yet been obtained. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Luan-Yu Labor-Capital Affairs Supervision Office has already begun to be organized on the 2nd. Tao Shangming has sent a special telegram to report this. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yu Xuezhong visited He Yingqin and Huang Fu to report on his trip to Wuhan. He returned to Tianjin this afternoon and will begin preparations to raise funds for repairing the Yellow River in Hebei Province. (3rd Dispatch)</p>

<p>Circumventing the Furnace House Old Factory</p>
<p>Reaching the Border of Zhenkang County</p>
<p>Yunnan Provincial Government Reports to Nanjing</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Japanese sources reported that Lancang County, Yunnan Province, has been occupied by the British. As of the evening of the 3rd, the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not received any formal official reports from the Yunnan Provincial Government or the Special Diplomatic Envoy. It is generally observed that the topography of Lancang Ban Hong is contiguous, arousing covetousness, which may be possible. Currently, the Executive Yuan believes that the situation on the Yunnan border is of utmost importance. On the 3rd, they telegraphed the Yunnan authorities to investigate and respond quickly. As for the survey of the Yunnan border, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has decided to send Yin Mingde of the Asia Department to go there. They are currently collecting materials. If the surveying personnel of the General Staff Department can be appointed immediately, they will set off together. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Yunnan Provincial Government telegraphed Nanjing, reporting that they received an urgent report from Zhenkang County, Yunnan Province, stating that the Burmese natives who invaded Ban Hong have circumvented the Furnace House Old Factory and invaded the Zhenkangzhai area under the jurisdiction of Zhenkang County, Yunnan Province, and will advance towards Manjiu. The situation is very urgent. It is found that Zhenkangzhai has always been a Yunnan region and is not outside our national boundary. Moreover, the area south of Ban Hong and the Furnace House Old Factory is still a silver mining area, and the area north of the Furnace House Old Factory to Zhenkang Huke and other places is a gold mining area. If occupied, our country's numerous gold mining areas will all fall into the hands of foreigners. Although those who arrived at Zhenkangzhai are Burmese natives, they are fearless and obviously have political implications. It is hoped that negotiations with Britain will be expedited and the natives will be stopped from advancing. (3rd Dispatch)</p>

<p>Two Measures Decided</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan passed the rules for special envoys to inspect local areas: (1) Special envoys may set up offices within the inspection area; (2) Special envoys may be granted special seals; (3) Special envoys may request emergency punishment for serious incidents discovered in the places they inspect. The Control Yuan believes that the Executive Yuan has no right to formulate these rules. If implemented, it will obviously conflict with the establishment of the supervisory offices of the supervisors in various provinces by the Control Yuan. After the meeting, two measures were decided: (1) The Control Yuan will send a letter of inquiry to the Executive Yuan; (2) They will request President Yu to promptly plan for the establishment of supervisory offices of the supervisors in various provinces. The letter of inquiry was sent out on the same day. If there is no result, there will be a second step. As for the letter to President Yu, it was sent to Shanghai yesterday by personnel. More than twenty supervisory committee members signed it, hoping that the supervisors could be implemented in the next year. (3rd Dispatch)</p>

<p>National Finance Conference</p>
<p>Scheduled for May 21st</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The preparatory committee for the National Finance Conference held its second committee meeting on the 4th. The estimated cost of the conference is over 27,000 yuan. Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi arrived in Nanjing to discuss: (1) The Finance Conference is scheduled to be held on May 21st, with a duration of about one week to discuss issues such as how to abolish illegal and excessive taxes in various provinces and cities; how to compensate after the abolition of excessive taxes; how to align the revenue and expenditure of various provinces; and if a province has legitimate expenditures, but its revenue is insufficient to cover them, the central government should, based on the situation, find ways to assist. (2) Improving the currency system and expanding the Central Mint. The Ministry of Finance indeed has this plan, but the required funds and implementation steps are still under discussion. (3) Regarding the issue of adopting the gold standard, it is a very significant matter. As the Finance Minister, I dare not express my opinion. Because our country uses silver, if we want to adopt the gold standard, it must be carefully considered over a long period to achieve perfection. It must be decided after research by various economic experts. (4) The rumor that the Guangdong province previously paid for the Northern Expedition expenses and that the central government would reimburse it is not worth a knowing person's smile. During the Northern Expedition era of the Revolutionary Army in Guangdong, Nanjing was not yet the capital. Guangdong was the central government, so there should be no distinction between Guangdong and the central government. Moreover, the Guangdong authorities have not made such a proposal.

<h3 id="e28">Key Points of Post-Disaster Reconstruction in Bandit Areas <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Since our country began strictly suppressing bandits, bandit areas have been gradually recovered, and there is hope for complete elimination within a limited time. Therefore, the issue of post-disaster reconstruction cannot but be urgently considered. Here, based on our humble opinion, we list the major points as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Appeasing Refugees: Today, the military action to suppress the Red Army is not a battle for land, but a battle for the people. The first priority after the recovery of bandit areas is to appease refugees. The exact number of refugees should be thoroughly investigated. The method should be to first register in cities and towns in each province and places where refugees gather, noting the refugee's origin, age, family status, etc., in detail. If it is found that some people were forced to join the rebellion due to the Red bandits' coercion, they should be pardoned for their past actions and allowed to rehabilitate themselves. During the registration period, reception centers should also be established to send refugees back to their hometowns as soon as possible. Strong laborers can be employed in public works projects such as road construction and land reclamation. The elderly and weak should be properly assisted by the government.</p>
<p>(2) Strengthening Self-Defense: Bandit areas have just been recovered, and local supplies are difficult. It is difficult for large armies to be stationed there, so it is necessary to strengthen the people's self-defense capabilities. On the one hand, implement the Baojia system; on the other hand, strengthen defensive fortifications. The government has already promulgated regulations on the Baojia organization method, which extends from households to Jia, to Bao, to Lianbao, and to districts, reaching the county. The system is interconnected and responsive. However, there are not many counties in the bandit areas that can truly implement it. The abuse of power and oppression of villagers by Baojia chiefs is particularly appalling. The people only increase the burden on district offices, etc., without any practical benefit. Therefore, it is necessary to find ways to correct the selection of Baojia chiefs. Those with both courage and knowledge and who have received considerable training should be appointed. After selection, personnel should be secretly assessed at any time to prevent malpractices. The construction of walled villages has greatly contributed to the suppression of the Red Army this time. Any town with defensible terrain should build earthen forts as a place for nearby residents to store grain and provisions. Deep trenches should be dug around to prevent sneak attacks. Sentries should be posted outside the forts day and night, and night watches should be sounded inside the forts to prepare for emergencies. As for the passages that the Red bandits must pass through, tall buildings should be built. The foundation of the buildings should be on high ground and rocky ground to prevent the bandits from attacking from above or digging in from below. Soldiers should be stationed inside the buildings to defend. Bullets, gunpowder, food, firewood, and water should be stored as much as possible to prevent encirclement by ruthless bandits. The construction of the buildings is intended to restrict bandit activities. Even if there is an alarm, it can be quickly sealed off. It was previously heard that the construction of walled villages in the bandit areas of Jiangxi was quite poor. Only Leping County was considered excellent. Guixi was second. The rest were poorly constructed and not functional. Later, the chairman of the provincial government actively promoted it, and the results were considerable. After the disaster, the people in the bandit areas were unable to engage in this work, so it was necessary to rely on the government to plan and implement it.</p>
<p>(3) Reorganizing Land: The Red bandits were obsessed with Wang Mang's "equal land" system and implemented their land distribution policy, burning contracts, destroying land boundaries, thoroughly confiscating and thoroughly distributing land, destroying the foundation of the rural economy in bandit areas. The Nanchang Headquarters has formulated thirteen question-and-answer types of land treatment methods for the recovered bandit areas to explain. Its content is roughly as follows: (A) Maintaining the system of private land ownership, but implementing a limit on landlords, limiting the area of land they own from one hundred acres to a maximum of two hundred acres. Beyond the limit, in addition to paying ordinary land tax, they must also pay progressive income tax. (B) At the same time, using peaceful methods of land distribution based on population, so that all cultivators have land to cultivate. These two principles are in line with the times and await implementation. However, in areas that have been deeply affected by banditry, there must be a lot of land where boundaries have been completely destroyed and owners have died. How should it be distributed? It is not specified. We believe that in this situation, we can only take special measures to abolish the private land ownership system and distribute the land to farmers for cultivation. The detailed methods of public distribution can be determined by the Rural Reconstruction Committee.</p>
<p>(4) Educational Facilities: The Red bandits implemented Red education for the people in the bandit areas, forcing them to accept it to numb their thinking. The reason why the military actions to suppress the Red Army have repeatedly gained and lost may be due to the neglect of changing the thinking of the people in the bandit areas. To remedy this, we must start with educational facilities. First, we must strive to popularize education in terms of quantity. Second, we should widely recruit intellectuals from the bandit areas who have fled to various places and send them back to their hometowns. Intellectuals have always been respected in rural areas and are most powerful in changing customs.</p>
<p>Other aspects, such as promoting the rural economy, developing land and water transportation, clarifying officialdom, and improving people's hearts, are essential steps for the revitalization of China as a whole and are not limited to post-disaster reconstruction in bandit areas, so they will not be discussed here for the time being.</p>

<p>Admits to Laying Double Tracks and Strengthening Transportation Capacity</p>
<p>Preserving Every Inch of Territory to Resist Foreign Aggression</p>
<p>The Soviet Russian Ambassador to the United States, Troyanovsky, gave a speech at the Foreign Affairs Association in Cincinnati, Ohio, stating that the Soviet Union is eager for peace, but will never lose an inch of territory for peace. The reason why I repeatedly discuss the issue of peace is that the danger of war is very great, and the international situation is as tense as in 1914. It can even be said that it is more tense than before the start of the European War. The militaristic spirit of some national authorities is even greater than at any time. If the next war unfortunately occurs, the tragic consequences will be beyond our prediction. However, the people of all countries do not have a war-like mentality. At present, the two mentalities of eagerness to try and hope for peace are competing. Before we have a solid guarantee, we cannot be fooled by vague promises of disarmament. Finally, the Soviet Russian ambassador also said that it is not entirely hopeless to strive for peace. The restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia is enough to consolidate peace and add a layer of protection to world peace. (Havas telegram on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Before giving a speech at the Foreign Affairs Association in Cincinnati, Ohio, the Soviet Russian ambassador to the United States made a statement to the press, stating, "We do not believe that democracy has died. What our country is practicing is a kind of complete democracy, in which economic equality and no class distinctions exist. Our country's production equipment cannot be regarded as private property. Stalin's power is indeed greater than that of others, but we do not regard him as a dictator. The reason why his power is greater is because his ability surpasses others. We must obey Stalin, no matter what his orders are. Although Stalin is supervised by the party, we still obey the command of one person. The Soviet Union has no possibility of compromise with capitalism. The basis of its economic system is that those who work more get more benefits, and it does not adopt the principle of absolute equality. The production equipment is also the property of the state." When talking about international issues, Troyanovsky said, "The situation in Europe is more tense than in 1914." He denied the rumor that the Soviet Union intends to go to war with Japan, but admitted the construction of double-track railways, saying that this is precisely to show that the Soviet Union has sufficient strength to deal with countries that threaten peace in the Far East. (According to reports in mid-March of this year, the Soviet Union, in order to prepare for the situation in the Far East, plans to lay a large railway across Siberia, parallel to the existing Siberian Railway.)</p>

<p>With the Precedent of Holland and Switzerland to Draw Upon</p>
<p>A Precaution Against Japanese Aggression</p>
<p>American Senator Littell Expresses His Opinion</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, Senator Littell, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told the Associated Press that if the Fiji independence bill takes effect and Fiji is still not recognized as a neutral zone like Holland and Switzerland, Fiji's position is very dangerous. Therefore, when signing the treaty for Fiji's permanent independence, Russia must be invited to participate. Littell also said that the main countries participating in the Fiji neutrality treaty are Russia, Japan, and China, which are Fiji's neighbors, and England, France, and Italy, which dominate the seas, as well as the United States and one or two other countries, because they all have interests in Fiji. The consultation of the treaty is not difficult, because there are precedents of Holland and Switzerland. The reason why the United States has been hesitant and unwilling to grant Fiji independence is because it fears that after Japan's economic aggression on the island, it will follow with military aggression. (The Philippine independence bill proposed by Tydings-McDuffie has been passed by both houses of Congress last month and has been approved by President Roosevelt. According to the provisions of the bill, Fiji's independence will be realized in ten or twelve years, at which time the United States will completely withdraw its army, navy, and air force from Fiji.)

<p>Rumored to Have Four Conditions</p>
<p>Japan Believes It Is Difficult to Achieve</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The most notable event in recent world public opinion is the issue of the Soviet Union's participation in the League of Nations. According to information received by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, this issue has been seriously discussed by relevant parties two or three months ago. Moreover, Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov will go to Geneva on the 12th of this month to attend the Disarmament Commission, so the issue of Russia's participation in the League of Nations is attracting more attention from various countries. However, it is heard that the conditions for the Soviet Union's participation in the League of Nations are four: (1) All member states of the League of Nations must recognize the Soviet Russian government; (2) It is hoped that all member states will sign non-aggression treaties with the Soviet Union; (3) The demand for racial equality; (4) The reconciliation of the Non-Aggression Pact and the League of Nations Covenant. The above issues are all outstanding issues that European countries and the League of Nations have not yet resolved. Some member states of the League of Nations, such as the Czech Republic and Finland, have not yet recognized each other, so the Soviet Union's demand for recognition is nothing more than the unique diplomatic tactics of the Soviet Union. Moreover, the issue of racial equality is unlikely to be realized. As for the issue of non-aggression treaties, it is not easy to realize due to the relations between England, Italy, and France. In particular, the Soviet Union's national system is absolutely incompatible with the League of Nations, and the form of participation is difficult to realize due to precedents such as Mexico and Turkey.

<p>The Navy Orders a Thorough Investigation</p>
<p>Several senior American naval officers in Saint Peter Port, after receiving instructions from the Navy Department, are investigating the activities of the Communist Party in the American fleet, because four people were arrested for distributing the magazine "Sailors' Voice." It is said that the magazine advocates adopting the "direct action" method found on British warships in 1931. Colonel Andrew (chief of staff to Admiral Leif, commander of the American battle fleet) has ordered a thorough search and the implementation of a grace period to report Communists in the military in order to improve the morals of soldiers in the navy, because the fleet will sail to the Atlantic coast for exercises next month. It is said that this investigation will pay special attention to whether other Communist books are distributed in the fleet and whether there are naval soldiers participating in such activities. It is found that the leader of the four naval soldiers arrested this time is named Britton. The investigation team is now accusing him of "distributing Sailors' Voice" because White possesses thousands of secret pamphlets. White has now confessed that he sold twenty secret pamphlets to a sailor on the flagship California. The investigation revealed that all those who purchased the magazine did not know its contents beforehand, and several people reported everything to the fleet commander afterwards. (National Telegram on the 2nd)</p>
<p>American Rear Admiral Andrews, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Naval Commander in Port Saint Peter, California, ordered an investigation because of the activities of Communist elements in the Navy. Four naval soldiers were arrested for distributing publications advocating rebellion. The Communist Party's office was also inspected, and various propaganda materials inciting Hawaiians to rebel were confiscated. One Communist was arrested. (Havas telegram on the 2nd)</p>

The hotel industry here welcomes the change of time, because passengers will have to stay here overnight. (Reuters telegram on the 3rd)</p>

<p>(Moscow) Beroyan, a member of the Stalin Transport Engineering Society, designed a system that, if adopted, would allow trains on the Soviet Russian railway to travel at 175 miles per hour. Beroyan has now created a new type of train, each with four cars, capable of carrying 185 passengers and their luggage, with a speed of over 100 miles per hour. It is driven by an electric motor and is equipped with special wheels. This year, it will run between Moscow and Leningrad. The existing tracks do not need to be changed, but due to the special wheels, the intersections need to be改造. Beroyan intends to increase the speed to 175 miles per hour.

<p>Holds Industry and Transportation in One Hand</p>
<p>Puppets Flatter Their Master in Every Detail</p>
<p>Xi Xie in Japan Negotiates the So-Called Protocol</p>
<p>Both Presidents and Vice Presidents of the South Manchuria Railway Postpone Their Return</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the special envoy Zheng Xie and Xi Xie went to Japan, they negotiated with the Japanese authorities on the issue of developing the puppet state. The Japanese side intends to take this opportunity to sign a Japan-Manchuria Economic Co-prosperity Treaty with the puppet leader to firmly control the economic power of the puppet state. The main items in the treaty are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Japan-[Manchuria] Common Tariff Issue, (2) Japan-[Manchuria] Industrial Division of Labor Issue, (3) Matters Related to Japan's Monopoly Investment in [Manchuria], (4) Economic Issue of Transportation Agencies Returning to Japanese Hands, (5) Free Immigration of Japanese and Korean People and Their Privileges.</p>
<p>That is, to implement Japan's so-called Japan-[Manchuria] Economic Control Policy, Japan intends to sign an Economic Co-prosperity Protocol with the puppet state similar to the Joint Defense Treaty. The president of the South Manchuria Railway was ordered to postpone his return to Manchuria for this reason. (Hualian telegram on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the government decided to maintain its regime, it paid close attention to its policy toward [Manchuria]. At the cabinet meeting on the 30th, Minister Nagai was explaining the industrial development policy of Manchuria and the Resource Bureau plan under discussion. Regarding this matter, the central department of the military and the Kwantung Army are also studying countermeasures. After unifying the opinions of the foreign affairs, finance, industry, and transportation authorities of the [Manchukuo] and the South Manchuria Railway, they will move toward the concretization of the major national policy toward Manchuria. The mission of Zheng Xiaoxu and Xi Xie, two puppet envoys who came to Japan this time, is to prepare for Japan-[Manchuria] economic cooperation, which is also their important purpose. Xi Xie will visit Minister of Finance Takahashi on the night of the 6th, visit Governor of the Bank of Japan Hijikata on the night of the 7th, and meet with other financial giants to discuss everything. Prime Minister Saito will also meet with Xi Xie on the night of the 6th and will discuss everything with Zheng Xie on this issue again within a few days. Meanwhile, Lin and Hatta, the president and vice president of the South Manchuria Railway who are currently staying in Tokyo, will postpone their return until the 12th or 13th to consult with Minister of Colonial Affairs and Minister of Finance on the policy of Japan-[Manchuria] co-existence and co-prosperity. It can be seen from the above meetings how far the government's work on establishing a national policy toward [Manchuria] has progressed. (Den-tsu telegram on the 3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e40">America's Attitude Toward the Puppet State Causes Astonishment in London <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>The Declaration of Non-Recognition is Still Fresh in Our Minds</p>
<p>Nanjing Should Not Disrupt the International Front</p>
<p>(London) According to recent reports from Washington, the United States has shown a trend towards recognizing [Manchukuo], which has caused considerable surprise and doubt in European political circles. The US government denies this claim. However, the public firmly believes that the US attitude towards recognizing [Manchukuo] remains ambivalent. If the US decides to take steps to recognize [Manchukuo], the problems arising from this move will be numerous. First, the US action would put the League of Nations in a difficult position. On July 1, 1932, former US Secretary of State Henry Stimson stated in a note to China and Japan that the US would not recognize any system resulting from violations of the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Therefore, if the US were to recognize [Manchukuo], it would contradict this policy. To show solidarity with Stimson, the League of Nations issued a declaration on March 11, 1932. Although the content of the declaration was not entirely the same as the Kellogg-Briand Pact, it was generally similar. In the same year, the League of Nations also requested member states to refuse recognition of any treaty, agreement, or situation obtained by methods that violated the League of Nations Covenant. The League of Nations has exerted itself so much for the US, and now it is bound by this. Second, the US recognition of [Manchukuo] would be welcomed by Britain. Britain believes that the existence of [Manchukuo] will be long-lasting, and it will be difficult to shake Japan's dominance in Manchuria in the short term. Britain is very close to the League of Nations, so it does not want to violate the League of Nations' attitude towards [Manchukuo] and be the first to recognize it. However, Britain certainly hopes that the US will take steps to recognize [Manchukuo], as a precedent for them to follow in the future. It is reported that Germany is also considering the issue of recognizing [Manchukuo]. The tense relations between Germany and Russia have led to closer ties between Germany and Japan. According to recent reports, the German ambassador to Japan, Dirksca, will soon visit Shenyang and Harbin, seeking German trade opportunities in Manchuria, or even recognizing [Manchukuo]. Although Soviet Russia is suspicious of Japan and fears a joint Japanese-[Manchu] attack, in principle, Soviet Russia does not refuse to recognize [Manchukuo]. In fact, there are already Soviet consuls in [Manchukuo] conducting various negotiations with the [Manchukuo] authorities, as if the relationship between Soviet Russia and [Manchukuo] is already close. Conversely, [Manchukuo] has also sent consuls to various parts of Soviet Russia, and we have reason to believe that Soviet Russia has long been prepared to recognize [Manchukuo], using a non-aggression pact with Japan as an exchange condition. This type of pact is also what Japan and [Manchukuo] urgently want to sign with Kremlin. It is said that if Japan adheres to the promise of an open door policy in [Manchukuo], the news that the US may recognize [Manchukuo] is indeed credible. A London news agency traces the fact that the late President Roosevelt recognized Japan's annexation of Korea after 1910, and that today's President Roosevelt may take similar steps to recognize [Manchukuo]. Indirectly related to the issue of recognizing [Manchukuo] is the Philippine independence proposal made by Tydings and Mcduffie. The proposal stipulates that the US will gradually abandon the US Army and Navy bases on the island. Europe views this move by the US as a powerful action to improve US-Japan relations, and Britain also expresses its joy at this situation. Suspicion and hatred between Japan and the US make Britain's situation very difficult. Britain does not want to adopt a pro-Japanese policy to anger the US, nor does it want to stand on the same front as the US to provoke Japan's resentment, because Japan has become a strong commercial competitor to Britain today. If Japan makes a firm decision, it can also disrupt Britain's Far East markets. If US-Japan relations improve, Britain can avoid the difficulty of being caught in the middle.

First, the Japanese national anthem was played, and then Arima Ryokitsu read a welcome speech on behalf of the entire gathering. Zheng Xiaoxu mounted the platform amidst the cheers of the crowd and delivered a thank-you speech on behalf of the people of [Manchukuo]. At that time, Mitsuru Toyama shouted "Long live His Majesty the Emperor of [Manchukuo]" three times. Then, Special Envoy Zheng returned the salute and also shouted "Long live His Majesty the Emperor" three times. The meeting adjourned at 3 p.m. (Japan United News, 3rd)</p>

<p>Insull Becomes a Prisoner</p>
<p>Extradition No Longer a Problem</p>
<p>Greece Does Not Intend to Pursue Further Negotiations with Turkey</p>
<p>The Turkish Parliament in Istanbul has today approved the US-Turkey extradition agreement, so there is no longer any problem with the extradition of American Insull. Insull was officially arrested at 5 p.m. today. When he entered the detention center, his eyes were filled with tears, and he appeared extremely despondent. The US ambassador to Turkey reported to the US State Department today that the Turkish government has formally notified them that they will extradite Insull and hand him over to the US at any time. Insull's Turkish lawyer is currently appealing the verdict. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>Athens According to various newspapers, the Greek government does not intend to raise any special objections to the Turkish government's seizure of the [Maiatis] ship (the one Insull was on), considering it only an issue that could cause disputes under international law. The [Maiatis] ship was seized in the Bosphorus Strait, which is under the jurisdiction of the League of Nations Commission, like the Dardanelles Strait. Whether it is still considered Turkish territorial waters remains a question in some respects. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Washington) US Ambassador to Turkey Skinner informed the State Department that the Turkish government had approved the extradition of Insull and handed him over to the embassy. The State Department said it was very interested in the Turkish government's [expression of sincerity], but no one in the State Department could express an opinion on what decision the US would take to implement the extradition, as the US had not yet taken any measures to have its representatives in Europe negotiate with the Turkish police for the delivery of Insull. Chicago public lawyer Green advocates requesting the Turkish government to deport Insull instead of continuing the extradition process. If Insull is extradited, he can only be charged with illegally transferring assets. If he is deported by Turkey and then arrested, he can be charged with multiple crimes, such as (1) obtaining property by fraud, (2) theft, (3) violating bankruptcy laws, (4) using postal services for fraud, which is the most important. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>Constantinople Insull's appeal request was rejected today. The prosecutor claimed that the court's decision was a statement of facts, not a verdict, and therefore the appeal was not allowed. Thus, Insull's last chance to avoid extradition has been dashed, and he will soon be sent to the US for trial. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>

<p>Brussels Leopold III, the new King of Belgium, has recently ascended the throne at the age of 32, after the death of the old King Albert in a mountaineering accident. All his administrative actions follow the old rules and regulations, which has won him great popular support. The new King is extremely egalitarian and sincere. When he was 14, the Great War broke out, and he participated in the war in the trenches. When Belgium was occupied by German troops, he argued with his father, the King, to fight again, unwilling to submit to humiliation. The Queen, formerly Princess Astrid of Sweden, often pushes her baby carriage along the streets of Belgium, as simple as a common woman. They married in 1926 and have been known as the most beloved princess of this generation. It was once rumored that she would be engaged to the Prince of Wales of England. The King and Queen married out of love, having met and danced together in Paris before their marriage.

<p>Six Corpses Found Horizontally in a Room</p>
<p>Bloody Clothing Yields Clues, Criminals Arrested</p>
<p>White Bluffs, Washington A heinous murder and robbery case was discovered here on Saturday. The victims were four men and two women. The police now have a clue: a plain-colored shirt stained with blood. Several known criminals have been detained for interrogation. On Saturday night, a man named Sanders heard a dog barking fiercely in his neighbor Fried's house. Peeking through the window, he saw three dogs locked in a Packard car in front of the door, and two corpses lying on the floor inside the house. Greatly alarmed, he notified the police station. The police entered the house and found four male and two female corpses. The walls were stained with blood. Some of the six people had been shot to death, some had been beaten to death with heavy objects, and two had their throats cut. The items in the house were scattered, and the furniture was mostly broken. There had been a fierce fight in the room. Upstairs, a white cat was the only eyewitness to the massacre. The police believe it was a robbery, as two diamond rings owned by Fried's mother, worth $1,500, were missing. According to police opinions today, the murderers intended to eliminate all witnesses, hence the massacre of many people. The bodies were moved to the morgue last night for examination. Afterwards, the police issued a radio broadcast to the public. This morning, a tailor brought a blood-stained shirt to the police station, saying that someone had brought it to him yesterday asking to have it cleaned, and described the person's appearance in detail.

However, according to reports received, due to the vast area and sparse population, there has been no loss of life. However, a large amount of ice from the Skatárjökull glacier was thrown into the Skatár River. The river was originally a small stream, with its water coming from boiling springs. However, due to the large chunks of ice being thrown in, it suddenly became a torrent, threatening to flood. Reykjavik is 200 miles from the volcano, but the eruption can be clearly seen, looking like a fire dragon, about 3,000 feet high. At night, the red light obscures the sky. Some have counted the number of eruptions, saying that there are as many as 78 in 20 minutes, and the underground tremors, like thunder, can also be heard here. (National Telegram, 2nd)</p>

<p>The Provincial Chairman to Temporarily Oversee Affairs</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) Gu Renfa submitted his resignation to the provincial government, stating: "I, Renfa, with my mediocrity and lack of talent and knowledge, am grateful for your guidance. I have strived to serve, hoping not to fail in my duties. Unexpectedly, during an official trip, I received a telegram informing me of the affair in which Li Shuyun, from my humble home, had incited Liu Zhuomin, the dismissed head of the Second Branch Bureau of the Wuxi Public Security Bureau, to disobey orders and resist surrender, interfering with government and undermining discipline. I believed that the law should not favor relatives, as ancient teachings dictate. Therefore, I telegraphed to request that the woman be handed over to the court for investigation according to the law, and I requested punishment for myself. Some time has passed since then, and I have not received any clear instructions. Looking inward, I feel deeply ashamed. Rather than occupying a position without fulfilling its duties and failing to live up to your expectation, it is better for me to retreat and allow those with talent to serve, hoping to have the chance to repay your kindness in the future. Therefore, I implore you to forward this to the National Government, requesting permission to resign from my positions as a member of the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the head of the Civil Affairs Department. This will allow me to alleviate the blame for failing to properly manage my family and fulfill my desire to return to civilian life." On the third day, the provincial government decided to forward the resignation, and the chairman will temporarily oversee the department's affairs. (Third-day special dispatch)</p>

<p>By Our Special Correspondent, Geng Ya</p>
<p>Mourning Artifacts in the Ancient Capital</p>
<p>During my stay in Tianjin, I visited Mr. Zhang Boling, the president of Nankai University. He advised me [on the points to pay particular attention to when going to Xinjiang. From the perspective of the new province's environment, the first is the actual traffic situation, the second is the economic situation, and the third is the political situation and others. After all, convenient transportation and a vigorous economy are prerequisites for politics and everything else to improve. The so-called economy is the prerequisite for everything, and it is the core issue of all problems. There is no doubt that the world in the future will further evolve into a world of economics.] When asked about the school's funding situation and the number of students, he briefly replied, [The number of students is more than 400 in the university, 1,350 in the boys' high school, 300 in the girls' high school, and more than 200 in the girls' primary school. The annual expenditure is more than 600,000 yuan, with the university accounting for 400,000 yuan. The sources of funds are: one, the school's foundation; two, social donations; and three, government subsidies. In the past, all have been insufficient, and in the future, it will inevitably be difficult. The more developed the school, the greater the cost. The main reason is that the school upholds the educational goal, considers the students' level, and cannot admit too many examinees in the hope of increasing tuition income. The situation is almost the same as in the news industry. In order to fulfill the social education responsibilities, we must make some sacrifices.] Nanda is located eight li south of the city. The noise of the city is far away and cannot be heard. The scenery is quiet and very suitable for studying. The area is vast and can be developed in the future.</p>
<p>From Tianjin to Beiping, I took the Beining express train. The train came from Shanhaiguan and arrived at Tianjin Station at 3:45 PM. It departed for Beiping at 4:00 PM and arrived at 7:00 PM. There were several Japanese officers on board. Many Japanese people, soldiers stationed in Tianjin, and representatives of Chinese organizations welcomed and saw them off. There were four ticket inspectors, half of whom were Westerners. However, they did not use scissors and were not heard to speak Chinese. They walked ahead proudly. Many people called them [foreign ticket inspectors]. Mr. Wang, who was sitting nearby, asked a Chinese ticket clipper, [What is the monthly salary of those foreigners?] He replied, [350 yuan]. He asked again, [How much do you make, sir?] He replied, [Chinese ticket inspectors make from 35 to 70 yuan. Some make 90 yuan, but those are senior supervisors.] A person holding a free pass said, [The highest salary for foreign employees of the Beining Railway is that of someone in the Transportation Department, who makes 2,000 yuan a month. Hiring senior foreign employees is probably due to treaty relations. As for the additional employment of foreign ticket inspectors, it started after the Mukden Incident because many passengers claimed to be refugees or on official business and refused to buy tickets. Foreigners handle matters without regard to feelings, so they are hired to do this work.]</p>
<p>Mr. Wang continued, [Not long ago, the survey team for the Xin-Sui Highway, which was dispatched by the Railway Department, also appointed a Swede, an archaeologist named [Sven Hedin], as the team leader because Chinese were not competent enough. He planned to enter Xinjiang for archaeology for the third time, so he was specially appointed as the team leader, and the Beining Railway Bureau advanced 40,000 yuan for his salary. I heard that there are recent achievements in Beijing, [a new route has been discovered, which is 50 li shorter than the old route used by the Xin-Sui Long-Distance Bus Company.] However, foreign newspapers reported the news of this trip, without understanding the truth, and many headlines were [Sven Hedin's Expedition to Suiyuan and Xinjiang], which is very different from the original meaning. Those who heard it were surprised.</p>
<p>Looking out the window, suddenly there was a vast expanse of water, with thin ice near the edge. The train passed over it, and it trembled. Suddenly there were several flat houses, with dust piled on the roofs. The wild wind swirled up and down. Although the fields have been cultivated, there is no green at all. The climate north of the Yellow River is much colder than in the south. The crops are wheat, sorghum, millet, and corn. If the rainfall is even, they can be planted three times in two years. The wheat sown after the white dew in the last autumn had already sprouted two or three inches, but it withered due to the winter cold and must wait for the spring to warm up before it can grow again and mature in the summer, which is faster than spring planting. After passing through Langfang, the earth is round and no mountains can be seen. This kind of plain landscape is evident once you cross the Yellow River border. As the sun sets, a thin layer of white like frost spreads all over the ground. Its material is either salt or alkali. I arrived in the ancient capital in the evening and stayed at the Beichen Palace.</p>
<p>I have visited the Liulichang and the East and West Single Markets. The market seems to be more lively than in previous years. Japanese goods are everywhere. A certain gentleman read in the newspaper [the Beijing Anti-Japanese Association investigated and burned Japanese goods in the Confucius Temple] and was horrified. When asked why, he replied, [The front line of national defense is the special environment of Beiping and Tianjin, just like the recent strong winds, which blow the soil and dust. The wind helps the soil, and the soil helps the wind. It is really hard to describe the depression of the yellow sky and gray earth.</p>
<p>The city of Beiping is full of gray dust, and the wind is even worse. In order to prevent pedestrians from falling into the five-mile fog, street cleaners constantly sprinkle water, but the wind blows and the sun shines, and it is immediately ineffective. Moreover, the remote streets and alleys are mostly piled with coal ash. In the area of Nei Dong Shuncheng Street, the pile of soil is as high as the city wall, so there was a statistic in the past that [it cannot be completely transported away in twelve years]. Now, the city government is planning to tidy up the city's appearance and has discussed with various bureaus to build a light rail to facilitate the removal. There is still a lot of accumulated soil in other places, and we should continue to clean it up. The fundamental solution is to urgently repair solid roads and ban the piling of dirty soil everywhere, so that the East Legation, which is the only one who is so proud, will not be able to remain proud forever.</p>
<h3 id="e88">A Corner of the Temple of Heaven in Beiping <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Walking to the Xiannongtan and the Temple of Heaven outside Qianmen, the palaces and terraces are magnificent, and the ancient cypresses soaring into the sky are particularly rare. Because the cypresses were planted in the Yuan and Ming dynasties, they are all living trees that two or three people can encircle. Ancient relics, scenery, and city appearance are all important. Recently, there has been a lot of logging. Going forward to investigate carefully, you can see that only one root has two plants, and one of them has been sawed off. If you go to a certain side or a whole piece, dig it up by the roots, it is difficult to find. I heard that a total of more than 330 cypresses have been stolen from each altar, worth more than 150,000 yuan. There is a [Guan Geng Terrace] in the Xiannongtan. It was a wooden frame in the Ming Dynasty, but Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty changed it to a brick and stone structure for the emperor to watch his officials plowing to the end of the field after personally plowing. In front of the platform is the [site of the imperial plowing]. It is said that the emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties performed the ritual of offering sacrifices to the Xiannong every year, and then personally plowed here. The ritual was performed by an old farmer of Shuntian Prefecture, wearing a coir raincoat and hat and leading an ox. The emperor wore a yellow dragon robe, held the plow on the right, and held the whip on the left. In the Ming Dynasty, he pushed three times and returned three times. After Emperor Yongzheng of the Qing Dynasty, he pushed four times and returned four times. The governor of Shuntian Prefecture carried a green box, and the vice-minister of the Ministry of Revenue sowed seeds. After the ceremony, the emperor watched from the [Guan Geng Terrace], and the farmer still had to finish plowing the field, which was both illusory and interesting. The scale of the Temple of Heaven is larger than that of the Xiannongtan. There is a [No. 21 Middle School] inside, and there are also troops stationed there, living in the halls. I only visited the Qinian Gate, the Qinian Hall, and the Huangqiongyu. The Qinian Hall is built on a circular high platform, which is divided into three levels, with a total of twenty-seven steps. The steps on the front are inlaid with three large carved stones. The lower level is clouds, the middle level is phoenix, and the upper level is dragon, all of which are extremely exquisite. There is a wooden sign in front of the tree, which says [Protect the carved stones, please walk on both sides]. At that time, there were four Japanese men and women, and one of them stepped on the carved stones and climbed up. I remembered that when I visited the [Beiling] in Shenyang in the 19th year of the Republic, I also saw Japanese people doing this. Looking back on the past, I couldn't help but feel sad.</p>

<p>Western Route Chen's Troops Capture Yangxi</p>
<p>Nanchang communication: Chen Cheng's troops of the Third Route Army were responsible for eliminating the Red bandits in the border area of eastern Jiangxi and northern Fujian and for coordinating with northern Fujian to advance into Jianning and Taining. Recently, the military agency received a telegram of victory from Fan's division, stating: [This division occupied the east side of Yanaiguan on the 28th at noon. The brigade went straight down to Yanaiguan from Niujiaodi Yunwufeng. The bandit pseudo 38th Regiment of Southern Yanaiguan was defeated by our brigade. We successively occupied Yanaiguan and Wuliao. At the end of the day, the brigade occupied various roads and went straight down to Chahua Pass. On the 24th, Chahua Pass, Shacen Pass, and Dayuan and other places were successively occupied by our brigade. We immediately began to build blockhouses between Deguan and Dayuan and sent a team to contact the师 of Xinqiao. On the 26th, because the bandits attacked the师 urgently, we ordered the旅长 to lead the团 and the团 out of Chahua Pass to attack Shuihu. On the 27th, the brigade continued to attack Beibian Kangyaopai Cen between Shuihu and Xinqiao. I led赴 Baoshi to respond. From noon to Shen, we attacked repeatedly and occupied it firmly, so that we could connect with the position of 师 of Xinqiao. In this battle, a total of 50 people including the regimental commander of the pseudo 37th Regiment were killed, and more than 70 light machine guns and rifles were seized. According to the confessions of the captured bandits, the bandits lacked food and ammunition, and their morale was disintegrating. The time for annihilation is not far away.] According to the telegram, Chahua Yanaiguan is located on the border of Jianning and Taining and is the position of the pseudo 5th Army. Now that it has been recovered by us, it can be attacked from the east and west with the Eastern Route Army, and the city of Jianning can be taken down soon. As for Baishe, between Nanfeng and Guangchang, it was also captured by Chen Cheng's troops. The army advanced south towards Guangchang, defeated the pseudo 10th Army, and occupied Jiyashan. There is a fortress built by bandits on the mountain, which is covered by pine trees to prevent aircraft. The fortress can accommodate a团 force and has a large number of storage depots, obtaining 50 shis of white rice, more than 200 catties of salt, several shis of clear oil, and more than ten tanks of clean water. Currently, the army is still advancing towards Guangchang.</p>
<p>The Western Route Army recovered Yangxi, located between Anfuxin, Lianhua, Pingxiang, and Yichun, on the 26th. Although the area was approved by Commander-in-Chief He to be designated as a special political zone by Chairman Chiang last year, it was too deeply bandit-infested to be recovered. The director of the political bureau of the district, Bai Shinuo, was working in the commissioner's office of the tenth district. It was not until the 26th of this month that Yangxi was recovered by Chen Guangzhong师. Director Bai has already advanced with the army to handle relief, recruitment, and other follow-up work.

<p>Police Department Telegraphs Chiang and Zhang, Reporting Capture Details</p>
<p>Xu Yuanquan Dispatches Military Law Director to Hankou for Joint Trial</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Hong Lake, at the border of Mianyang and Jianli in Western Hubei, and Chang Lake, at the border of Jiangling, Qianjiang, and Jianli, have been notorious bandit dens in recent years. Hong Lake was occupied by the remnants of Jia Long's bandits, but it was cleared after the bandit He roamed away. However, Chang Lake's bandit nest still had bandits gathering. Their leaders, Sun Dazhi, Li Hongfa, and Li Guanghua, not only directed arson, killings, robberies, and plunder, but also had political backing. The bullets they needed were all transported from Hankou. Sun and others also came to Wuhan from time to time. The headquarters of the Pacification Commissioner learned of this and ordered the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters to investigate strictly. A few days ago, the police department captured them, without a single one escaping. Three suspects were also apprehended and interrogated separately. Xu Yuanquan, Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the Hunan-Hubei Border Region, specially dispatched Liu Xiang, Director of Military Law, to Hankou to discuss the handling of the case with the police department, since the bandits were apprehended. Two days after solving the case, the police department telegraphed the headquarters of General Chiang, Deputy Commander Zhang, and Director He of the Pacification Commissioner, reporting the details. The telegram stated: [Case investigation: Previously, we received instructions stating that, according to reports, the bandit leaders of Chang Lake, Sun Dazhi and Sun Damao, etc., definitely had political backing and their bullets were all transported from Hankou. We were ordered to investigate, arrest, and report. We immediately ordered our subordinates to investigate and arrest them swiftly and secretly, and report back for review. Now, according to the report from the Inspection Department of this headquarters, after receiving the order, they made many efforts to collect information and arrest them. They have now apprehended the principals Sun Dazhi, Li Hongfa, and Li Guanghua at Bayuanli, Taiyuli, and Taikangli, etc., in Hankou, and also apprehended the suspects Li Daxiang, Zhao Longchen, and Yang Tongbai. They have all been handed over for interrogation. In addition to ordering the department to actively interrogate them and submit a proposed verdict after the interrogation, we hereby telegraphically report to your superiors for review. Respectfully, Ye Peng, Wuhan Garrison Commander.] (April 2nd)</p>

<h3 id="e92">Northeastern Railways Under Japanese Control (Changchun Correspondence) <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The Northeast relies almost entirely on railways for transportation due to its scarcity of rivers and coastlines. The construction of the Northeast railways dates back several decades, and the development of the Northeast has also taken place over several decades. Therefore, it would not be an exaggeration to say that the history of Northeast railway construction is the history of Northeast development.</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, the railway situation in the Northeast has been very different than before. Not only did Japan build many new trunk lines to cope with the current tense situation in the Far East, such as the Dundu, Labin, and Kehai lines, establishing three major trunk line systems (namely, one from Dalian via the South Manchuria Railway, two from the Korean West Line via Pyongyang and Seoul, and three from the Jingtun Line via the Sea of Japan), but also its management rights have undergone tremendous changes.</p>
<p>Before the outbreak of the September 18th Incident, the Northeast railway management system could be summarized into the following three types:</p>
<p>1.  State-owned railways under the leadership of the Northeast Communications Committee of our country.</p>
<p>2.  The South Manchuria Railway and its branch lines under the leadership of the Japanese South Manchuria Railway Company.</p>
<p>3.  The Sino-Soviet joint venture, the Chinese Eastern Railway, and its branch lines.</p>
<p>Now, except for the second item, the Japanese South Manchuria Railway, which has not undergone major changes, the Sino-Soviet joint venture, the Chinese Eastern Railway, under the threat of Japanese iron hooves (such as the unwarranted detention of Soviet employees, etc.), the Soviet Union was forced to consider transferring the railway to Japan. Not long ago, Japan even held a so-called railway purchase conference to carry out this matter. As for our state-owned railways, they were entrusted to the management of the South Manchuria Railway by the puppet Ministry of Communications on March 1st of last year. The South Manchuria Railway established the so-called [Railway Bureau] to specialize in this matter. Its excuse was once declared to be to unify the management of the Northeast railways in order to engage in rational management, so that economic and technical efficiency could be improved. In fact, this kind of cover-up is precisely a case of trying to hide what is already obvious. Before September 18th, our state-owned railways, under the leadership of the Communications Committee, were extensively constructed. In a few years, using domestic capital and technology, the Hu-Hai, Qi-Ke, Shen-Hai, and Ji-Hai railways, totaling 893 kilometers in length, were built, adopting a strategy of surrounding the South Manchuria Railway. Huludao was built to compete with Dalian, and a joint transportation system was established, reducing transportation costs, causing the number of goods transported by the South Manchuria Railway to plummet. In addition, our Northeast authorities placed obstacles everywhere, so the South Manchuria Railway was almost in a dead end in this environment. The outbreak of the Northeast Incident was largely due to this. Therefore, this time Japan forced the puppet organization to hand over the management rights of the railways to avoid repeating the same mistakes in the future. Moreover, transportation is the lifeblood of a country. With the lifeblood in the hands of the Japanese, there is no need to worry about further changes. And when facing war against the Soviet Union and us, it can use the three major trunk line systems to quickly transport troops to seize the initiative. This plan is extremely sinister.</p>
<p>As for our state-owned railways under the management of the so-called [Railway Bureau], there are about ten lines in total, and their names are as follows:</p>
<p>1.  The Guandong section of the Fengshan Line, Beining Railway, was renamed Fengshan after being occupied by the Japanese, starting from Shanhaiguan and ending in Shenyang. Its branch lines include Jinzhou to Beipiao, Dahushan to Tongliao, etc.</p>
<p>2.  The Shenhai Line, starting from Shenyang and ending in Hailong, is a line built entirely with domestic capital and technology. After the Northeast Incident, it was once managed by a railway security maintenance association organized by traitors.</p>
<p>3.  The Jihai Line. When this line was being built, the Japanese protested, claiming that it ran parallel to the South Manchuria Railway. Our country ignored this protest, which lacked reasonable grounds, and eventually completed it.</p>
<p>4.  The Jichang Line, starting from Changchun and ending in Yongji.</p>
<p>5.  The Jidun Line, from Yongji to Dunhua, is a part of the famous [Jihui Railway].</p>
<p>6.  The Duntu Line, from Dunhua to Tumen, is also a part of Jihui. Before September 18th, it could not be built due to our country's obstruction. After Japan forcibly occupied the Northeast, it accelerated its completion and is now open to traffic. The above three lines (Jichang, Jidun, and Duntu) form a straight line, so there is also a name called the Jingtun Line, which is from the puppet capital Changchun to Tumen.</p>
<p>7.  The Sitao Line. This line is composed of three lines: Sipingjie to Zhengjiatun, Zhengjiatun to Tongliao, and Zhengjiatun to Taonan. Its shape resembles a fork.</p>
<p>8.  The Taoang Line, from Angangxi to Taonan, is 224 kilometers long.</p>
<p>9.  The Taosuo Line, from Taoan to Solun, has only completed the Taoan to Huaiyuanzhen section due to financial difficulties.</p>
<p>10. The Qike Line, from Angangxi to Keshanzhen, with the Qiqihar to Keshan section completed not long ago.</p>
<p>11. The Huhai Line, from Hailun to Majiachuan Kou (close to Harbin) south of Hulan, is over 221 kilometers long.</p>
<p>12. The Labin Line, starting from Lafa and ending in Harbin (Binjiang), is 268 li long.</p>
<p>13. The Kehai Line, from Keshan to Hailun, is 167 kilometers long. This line and the Labin and Duntu lines mentioned above were all recently built by the South Manchuria Railway under [contract].</p>
<p>The current situation of the Northeast railways is roughly as described above. As for other matters such as railway security, it is controlled by the Japanese Kwantung Army based on the so-called [Japan-Manchukuo Agreement] and also by the Railway Bureau organized by the Japanese. As for its policy, because the railway is a frequent target of attacks by our righteous army, and the area is vast and difficult to guard, the following countermeasures have been decided: (1) Change the departure times of passenger trains at any time, and implement a [pioneer car] system when departing to verify whether the track has been damaged. (2) Implement war equipment in the car. (3) Strictly prevent our righteous army from mixing into the car. (4) Deploy an intelligence network to report the whereabouts and actions of the righteous army. (5) Complete communication equipment to facilitate rescue. (6) Investigate the actual situation of dangerous areas. (7) Increase railway security capabilities. (8) Build [railway protection villages] and provide small favors to villages near the railway to make them guard the railway. However, because the route is too long, and the righteous army is agile, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, it has not achieved complete results. (March 23rd)</p>

<h3 id="e95">Director of Jiangsu Finance Department Discusses the Situation of Jiangsu Province's Financial Reorganization <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The Reorganization Over the Past Half Year is Gradually Getting on the Right Track</p>
<p>Improving the Accounting System and Eliminating Embezzlement</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: Jiangsu's finances have always been notoriously difficult. Since the reorganization of the provincial government last year, reorganizing finances has been regarded as one of the most important tasks. Since its implementation, the results have been remarkable. The improvement of accounting and the determination of the budget have been valued by all sectors of society. Recently, according to Zhao Dihua, Director of the Finance Department, regarding the situation over the past six months, it is urgently recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province has always been known as the wealthy area in the southeast. In recent years, both the provincial and county levels have felt that income is insufficient to cover expenses. Year after year, the accumulated deficit is very large. In the observation of a group of financial managers, they either say that income is short or that expenditure is huge, and that increasing income and reducing expenditure is the most important plan for reorganizing finances. However, at the present time when the rural economy is declining, the burden on the people is already heavy. If we increase the unified tax or launch a new tax, it will be difficult to do so. As for the expenditure side, it has already been extremely tightened. There are still many projects that have not been launched, and we must never give up eating for fear of choking. That is to say, there is no way to increase income and no way to reduce expenditure. If we want to solve the financial difficulties, we should eliminate embezzlement and stop waste. The reason why the province's finances are exhausted is not the shortage of income, but the embezzlement of clerks; not the complexity of expenditure, but the improper use of it. Therefore, using accounting methods to reorganize finances is really the most important thing for reorganizing Jiangsu Province today. Now, the financial reorganization situation in the six months since the establishment of this provincial government is described as follows:</p>
<p>Unifying Financial Administration</p>
<p>The province has a complex variety of special funds, and the competent authorities in each province cannot unify income and expenditure. The Finance Department loses its control over the special funds because it does not have jurisdiction over them. The competent department, on the other hand, is restricted by the administrative system for the collection agencies, making assessment difficult. Therefore, it is inevitable that they are separated from each other, and each county regards the special funds as extra income, arbitrarily misappropriating them. In this way, although there is the name of special funds, it is not enough to meet the needs of special projects. The provincial government meeting has previously proposed and resolved a unified method. Except for special education funds, which have separate regulations, all other special funds shall be handed over to the treasury. The Finance Department shall then jointly issue payment orders with the competent department in accordance with the budget, and the treasury shall pay them. It has been implemented for four months now, and the income from various special funds has improved significantly compared to before.</p>
<p>Establishing an Accounting Director</p>
<p>Counties have not followed the rules for bookkeeping and reporting for various income and expenditure items. The reason for this may be that the county government affairs are too busy and its energy cannot be focused, or that the county government's funds are limited and talent cannot be concentrated. Since December of last year, accounting directors have been established in counties with higher tax revenue, totaling 22 counties, specializing in bookkeeping and auditing county government income and expenditure items. Although they are not responsible for cash receipt, payment, and custody, they are responsible for urging the clearance of provincial funds and the deposit of county funds. Since their assignment, the accumulated funds in each county have gradually decreased, the treasury system has been established, and the accounting organization has gradually become perfect.</p>
<p>Establishing a Provincial Budget</p>
<p>The province's budget for the 22nd year was not determined before the start of the year, and there was no standard for the annual income and expenditure. After the establishment of this provincial government, three months after the start of the year, we adopted the principle of full collection and full payment, and the principle of adapting expenditure to income. We repeatedly discussed with various departments and bureaus and received their approval to reduce uneconomical expenditures and deferrable projects, and determined the estimate. The difference between income and expenditure was not large. Up to the present, except that the expenditure side has been implemented in accordance with the budget, the income items are very close to the budget number. The malpractice of false income and actual expenditure can be reduced (as of the end of February of this year, 66% of the land tax, 65% of the business tax, and 64% of the deed tax were collected).</p>
<p>Reviewing County Budgets</p>
<p>The local budgets of each county in the province are fragmented, complicated, and insufficient. For every matter, an additional tax is added, so that the additional taxes in each county often exceed the regular tax. Although there are a small number of counties where the excessiveness of additional taxes is particularly obvious because the regular tax is too low, the complexity of additional taxes cannot be denied. Moreover, the increase in additional taxes is often collected rashly by the county without waiting for the approval of the Finance Department, which is even more inappropriate. The provincial government committee has previously proposed and resolved to organize a County Local Budget Review Committee. First, the county magistrate of each county shall convene a local meeting to study the methods of review and reduction, and then the county magistrate of each county shall bring the draft budget for the 22nd year to the province separately, and each department shall send personnel to attend and jointly review it, so that each department can understand the local financial situation of each county, and the review standards can be used to delete and change uneconomical expenditures and expendable expenses, in order to prevent the false spending of funds. We started reviewing the budget last December, and we can complete it in early April. At the same time, the review of the 22nd year budget of each county will be used as the standard for approving the 23rd year budget.</p>
<p>Implementing the Audit System</p>
<p>After the provincial and county budgets are determined, the key to its effective implementation lies in whether the audit system is sound or not. Please state the following three points: (1) Regarding the implementation of the budget, the provincial audit system has always been lacking. Although the funds of each agency are issued according to the budget, whether the actual expenditure situation meets the budget and whether there is any waste has never been supervised by a legal agency. Therefore, in order to promote its implementation after the provincial budget is determined, it is necessary to establish an audit agency. This matter has been approved by the provincial government committee to establish an Audit Committee. The members of the committee will be selected from specialized talents by the provincial government to serve as a purely detached agency responsible for auditing the income and expenditure of provincial funds. (2) Regarding the implementation of the county budget, after the county local budget is reviewed and determined by the department, only part of the pre-supervision work is completed. As for whether each county is implementing it in accordance with the approved budget, it is necessary to supervise all income and expenditure statements and annual final accounts of each county, that is, the Finance Department will audit the county funds and use them in the county. The Finance Department will also be in a detached position to perform supervision. (3) Regarding the establishment of the county treasury, the funds collected by each county are mostly deposited in local money shops and businesses, which is inconvenient for auditing and prone to malpractices. Therefore, the provincial government committee resolved the method of collecting, paying, and depositing county funds in each county. All county taxes collected by each county government shall be handed over to the fund property office for deposit in the treasury designated by the Finance Department. Each agency shall issue payment orders after the county magistrate verifies and fills them out, and then the accounting director and the director of the public fund and property management office shall audit and stamp them before paying them to the treasury. In this way, the income and expenditure of county funds will be on track.</p>
<p>After implementing the above-mentioned points one by one, the income and expenditure will be centralized, the accounting will be independent, and the funds collected by each agency and each county government will not be misappropriated. Not only the provincial treasury can be enriched, but also the local funds will not feel exhausted at times. The finances of the entire province will be on the right track. At the same time, each county is also handling land reporting. On the one hand, we are reorganizing the provincial and local finances through the accounting system, and on the other hand, we are eliminating long-standing malpractices and reducing the burden on the people by handling land reporting. If we promote it for a year, our Jiangsu finances may gradually be reorganized. (National News Agency)</p>

<p>Zhongshan Hall Opens Today</p>
<p>The people of Suzhou have raised over 30,000 yuan and built a Zhongshan Memorial Hall with a large scale on the old site of the Mi Luo Bao Pavilion in Xuanmiao Temple. It has been under construction for nearly a year and has now been completed. The internal equipment has also been completed. The county party headquarters has invited all sectors of society to organize a management committee to be responsible for management. It is now scheduled to hold an opening ceremony this morning (4th) and hold entertainment in the afternoon. The Construction Department has specially telegraphed County Magistrate Zou to attend and represent the Construction Department.</p>
<p>Songjiang</p>
<p>Song People Initiate New Guang Electric Company</p>
<p>The management of the local electric company has always been lacking. It is heard that a dispute between the new and old managers has recently occurred internally, and the dispute has not yet been resolved, resulting in further corruption in the business. Although various sectors of society have successively submitted requests to the Construction Committee and the Electric Power Industry Guidance Committee to urge improvement, they have not been able to awaken them, and they have fallen into a state where improvement is impossible. I have recently learned that local people such as Lu Guixiang have organized a New Guang Electric Co., Ltd. The news I have obtained is recorded as follows: The company is organized as a service limited company with a total capital of 300,000 yuan, divided into 6,000 shares, each share worth 50 yuan. In addition to the fact that half of the shares have been subscribed by the founders, the remaining 150,000 yuan will also be the responsibility of the founders to raise the full amount after the Construction Committee approves it. All the company's articles of association, feasibility study, budget, and engineering design drawings were also submitted to the National Government Construction Committee, Jiangsu Construction Department, and Songjiang County Government for filing yesterday. A preparatory office will be set up in the County Education Association first. The founders of the company are Lu Guixiang, Zhao Zukang, Lei Junyan, Zhang Zuocheng, Zhu Shujian, Shen Lianbi, Zhang Younong, and Hou Yunliang, and Mr. Lu Guixiang is the chief applicant. Mr. Lu is a graduate of the Department of Electrical Engineering of Beijing Jiaotong University and was sent by the Ministry of Communications to practice in the French Varouban雷 Wireless Electric Factory. After returning to China, he served as Section Chief of the Ministry of Communications, Director of the Radio Management Office of the Ministry of Communications, Factory Director of the Telecommunications Machinery Manufacturing Factory, and Director of the International Telecommunications Bureau. He is a domestic electrical expert. I met with the founder, Mr. Shen Lianbi, yesterday. According to him, since the conflict between the new and old managers of the Songjiang Electric Company occurred, although there have been many external criticisms, the internal disputes have not yet been resolved. For the sake of the future of public utilities, this organization must be established to assume the responsibility of the citizens. Knowing that this matter is significant, we should do our best to do it well. We hope that people from all walks of life will give guidance and supervision at any time so that it can be successful.</p>

<p>Tinglin is the leading town in the county, and the business is prosperous. It is very close to Zhuanghang, Yanduntou, and Huan'an in the four villages. One evening, there was a race lamp meeting in Yanduntou, Shanyang, Zhuanghang, and other places, and Tinglin was the place where the lamps were gathered. First, a portrait of the president was used as a talisman by an eight-person shoulder sedan. Yang Meilin, the chief of the first branch, ordered the police in advance to block it at the Caishen Temple in the North City. The villagers bravely advanced. The police and the security team tried to stop them but they did not listen. They fired a volley into the air, but the villagers thought it was the president's portrait and were greatly angered. One sang and a hundred echoed, and the group rushed to the first branch and destroyed the bureau building. Yang Meilin, the chief of the branch, hid in the wheat field and was spared. The seals and guns were not lost. It is now known that the Public Security Bureau has reported to County Magistrate Jin and ordered Zhang Baoxiong, the chief of the twelfth district, to be responsible for repairing the bureau's houses and sending the ringleaders to justice.</p>

<p>Provincial Government Revises Regulations on Renting Factories</p>
<p>County Magistrate Yan Shenyu, due to the closure of several silk factories, including Huishengtai and Xin, in the county last year, which caused significant harm to society, found that the main reason for their closure was the lack of solid capital. They would rent a silk factory from the owner and start production. As soon as they encountered losses, they would close down. To avoid this danger, he passed temporary measures for prohibiting rented silk factories at the county administrative meeting on February 26th of this year, and reported it to the provincial government for record. The county government received instruction No. 616 from the provincial government the other day, saying: "Noted. The temporary measures for prohibiting rented silk factories that you have formulated are necessary and should be filed for record. However, the clause about depositing one month's wages as a guarantee does not comply with Article 25 of the Factory Law. Article 4 should be changed to: 'All operators who rent factories, after signing the lease, should deposit 20 yuan per silk reeling machine into the bank as a guarantee deposit, and submit the deposit slip to the silk factory association before being allowed to start operations,' etc., to comply with the legal system. This order must be followed." The revised temporary measures for prohibiting rented silk factories by the provincial government are appended below: Article 1: These measures apply to all silk factories operating in Wuxi County that rent factories. Article 2: Before signing a lease, all operators who rent factories should first submit the names of the operating shareholders and managers, the total capital, the name of the silk factory to be rented, the number of machines, and the location in writing to the silk factory association. The association will send personnel to verify the capital and report to the county government for record before they can sign a contract with the factory owner. Article 3: The total capital in the previous article shall be no less than 100 yuan per silk reeling machine. Article 4: All operators who rent factories, after signing the lease, should deposit 20 yuan per silk reeling machine into the bank as a guarantee deposit, and submit the deposit slip to the silk factory association before being allowed to start operations. Article 5: After receiving the guarantee deposit slip, the silk factory association shall issue a receipt and report to the county government for record. Article 6: When a rented silk factory declares closure, if there are no outstanding wages, the silk factory association should return the guarantee deposit slip based on the evidence after the closure takes effect, and report to the county government for record. Article 7: Those who violate the provisions of Articles 2 and 3 will be ordered to suspend operations after investigation. Article 8: These measures will be implemented after being approved by the provincial government.</p>

<p>Recently, water robberies have occurred frequently. The river surfaces of Gaoqiao, Baitangwei, and other places are vast, making them a haunt for bandits. A boat sailing from Wuxi to Jiaoxi (i.e., Jiaodian Town) in Wujin County the other day, owned by Huang Renda, carried more than a dozen passengers and cargo from Wuxi. When passing through Baitangwei, at around 9 p.m., it was suddenly approached by two bandit boats. More than a dozen bandits jumped out, each holding pistols, flashlights, and other weapons, shouting for the boat to stop. The boat had no choice but to stop and allow them to search and rob. As a result, they were robbed of 85 yuan in paper money, 2 yuan in silver dollars, 28 jiao in small silver coins, 4,000 copper coins, and two pieces of silk cloth, totaling more than 200 yuan in losses. After the robbery, the bandit boat encountered the first team of the county water patrol on the way and opened fire as a warning. The patrol boat also fired back immediately. For a while, the sound of gunfire crackled like a string of beads. After more than ten minutes of fierce fighting, the bandits were unable to resist and retreated. The patrol boat was unable to pursue due to the late hour and returned to the team to report to Captain Qian, who reported it to the county government for investigation.</p>

<p>Li Shuyun, wife of Gu Renfa, Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Jiangsu Province, and her mother, Li Liu, are suspected of instigating the case of Liu Zhuomin and his wife, the head of the Second Public Security Bureau, who disobeyed orders and resisted surrender. At the same time, Gu discovered that they were accepting bribes and engaging in fraudulent activities, which led to their arrest and imprisonment. The evidence of their crimes has also been collected by Gu and sent to the procuratorate of the county court for investigation. The procuratorate has scheduled a summons for Gu Renfa to appear in court on the 4th of this month (i.e., today) for questioning. This has been reported in this newspaper repeatedly. It is now known that Li Bingsheng, Li Shuyun's brother, came to Wuxi the night before last because he saw in the newspaper that she was ill in prison. Yesterday, he went to the detention center with Yu Tianxi, the director of the Wuxi office of lawyer Chao, to see Li Shuyun and her mother. When they met, they were overwhelmed by the contrast between the past and the present. Because they were tormented by illness, they were very thin. The mother and daughter wept incessantly while talking. Bingsheng comforted them a few words and left. He took a car back to his residence in Nanjing that night. In addition, Li Wen , Li Shuyun's cousin, was very worried when he heard that Shuyun was coughing up blood in prison. He took a car from Shanghai to Wuxi yesterday morning. After getting off the car, he went straight to the detention center to visit Li Shuyun and her mother. As Shuyun's condition had not improved, he planned to find a way to bail her out and take her to Shanghai for treatment. However, Li's condition had improved greatly in recent days, and she was in better spirits. She also stated that she did not want to be released from prison easily before the case was concluded. Therefore, Li Wenhua had no choice but to heed her wishes and no longer request bail for her. Yesterday, someone talked to Shuyun and asked if she could consider the old affection between husband and wife, not pursue the past, and reconcile, as there were rumors that Gu Renfa had hired a lawyer to conduct reconciliation negotiations with them. Li closed her eyes and frowned upon hearing this, and became very angry, saying, "What is this? Gu has been so cruel to me and has long forgotten the affection between husband and wife. Now, the outside world has a clear understanding of this matter. Although I am a weak woman, I still have some ambition and will absolutely not yield to any force. Gu's request for reconciliation is a dream. Even if he casts an image of me, Li Shuyun, and prostrates and kowtows three times and nine times every day, I would never bother to answer." Her pale cheeks suddenly turned red, showing the intensity of her anger.</p>

<p>Villagers Burn Down Wenchang Pavilion</p>
<p>The Houlie Temple in Lian Township, the seventh district of Wujin County, was scheduled to hold a welcoming god and temple fair on the 2nd. The county government, based on reports from various parties, requested a ban. It immediately sent Chief Police Officer Liu Shiqin and personnel from the Public Security Bureau to the countryside the day before to arrest the head of the fair, Yuan Yida. Other heads of the fair, knowing that things were not going well, went to the temple on the evening of the 1st and secretly stole the Sanmao Bodhisattvas and other statues out of the temple and hid them. When more than a thousand people arrived at the temple at 9 a.m. on the 2nd, preparing to welcome the gods, they suddenly saw that the bodhisattvas in the temple were missing. They first questioned the abbot monk, then tore down the portrait of the president of the primary school attached to the temple and placed it on the altar, planning to hold the temple fair. A teacher from the school came out to stop them and was beaten by the crowd. They also entered the school and drove out all the teachers and students. All the classrooms, desks, and chairs in the Wenchang Pavilion, as well as the teachers' clothes, bedding, and books upstairs, were piled up in the courtyard and set on fire. Soon, the fire spread to the houses, causing all six rooms upstairs and downstairs in the Wenchang Pavilion to be completely burned down. The crowd still wanted to cause trouble at the Hutangqiao District Office. After a flying report, the county government and the Public Security Bureau sent a team to the countryside to suppress them. Wang Liangsheng and other eight people were arrested and sent to the city that evening for interrogation by the county government.</p>

<p>Mistaken Arrest During Smoke Search Leads to Shooting Injury</p>
<p>In Sandun Town, the fourth district of the county, Wu Wenguang, an inspector from the Da Tuan Public Security Bureau, suddenly led more than ten police officers to search for opium dens the other night. They arrested one opium offender and were taking him back when a passerby, Pan Asi, coming from the south, caught sight of the armed police escorting a person. Suspecting it was a conscription, he immediately took off running. Wu and the others became suspicious and immediately chased after him. Asi, knowing it was difficult to escape, stopped. Wu and the others tied him up with a rope and forced him to go with them. Near Datuan Town, Xu Aguan, a mason, was returning home from work in the town when he encountered Wu and the others. Not understanding the situation, he inquired about the truth from bystanders. Feeling injustice that Asi was arrested for no reason, he expressed his dissatisfaction. Wu, hearing this, did not investigate and ordered the police to fire a warning shot, which hit Aguan in the shoulder, causing him to fall to the ground in pain, bleeding profusely. Seeing the trouble he had caused, Wu took the injured person to the town and sent him to Datuan Hospital for treatment. The county Public Security Bureau learned of the incident and immediately ordered Inspector He Yangwei to go to investigate the situation that night and take Wu and the police officers back to the bureau for verification.</p>

<p>Boat Girl Commits Suicide Due to Love</p>
<p>When County Magistrate Zhou Heng came to Changshu last March, he hired a fast boat owned by his fellow villager, Shen Dalin, to take him to his post because he had many followers. Shen's boat had a wife, two sons, and a daughter named Abao, who was quite beautiful and 19 years old. She was appreciated by Zhou Fuchen, the county magistrate's younger brother, who hired the boat permanently, paying 30 yuan per month, and also recruited his two sons as servants in the county government. For more than ten months, everything was peaceful. Unexpectedly, Abao became pregnant after being ravaged by Zhou and asked Zhou to take her as a concubine. Zhou was not against it, but Zhou's wife refused and forbade her husband from going there. Abao, seeing that she had met the wrong person, took a large dose of opium on the 31st and died in the afternoon of the 1st. The news spread throughout the community. For the sake of his reputation, Zhou paid for her to take the boat away from Changshu and return home for burial.</p>

<p>Daytime Robbery on Cuiya Street</p>
<p>Shengkang Qianzhuang at No. 76 Cuiya Street in this port was opened by Lian Dongsheng from Anqiao, Jiangdong Town in this port. In addition to Lian himself serving as manager, he also hired partners Lu Jifa, Chen Atang, Hu Yongxiang, and apprentice Ding Fangxiang, among others. The business was quite prosperous on weekdays. At 2 p.m. the other day (the 31st), Lu Jifa, a partner of the bank, took 1,000 yuan in banknotes from various banks to the Kenye Bank on Jiangxia Street to exchange for Kenye banknotes that the bank was selling on consignment and had been returned, attracting the attention of bandits. When the partner returned to the shop after exchanging the banknotes, two bandits followed him inside, took out pistols, and shouted to silence them. As a result, in addition to the 1,000 yuan in Kenye banknotes that were robbed, 355 yuan in banknotes, 6 yuan in silver dollars, and 94 jiao in small change were also taken from the drawer in the silver room. After the bandits robbed the place, they left the shop swaggeringly. Afterwards, the bank reported the robbery to the Ningbo Public Security Bureau and the Detective Team for investigation. The chiefs of all the bureaus and teams dispatched all police officers and went to the railway station and pier to conduct strict inspections. Two suspects were arrested, but they were released after investigation due to lack of evidence. Yesterday (the 1st) afternoon, the Detective Team arrested a suspect, Chen Yunda, at the Fan Fuji restaurant on Xin Street. Zhang Jin, the cook of the bank, was also suspected of colluding in the case. The two have been sent to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>Wang Xiaolai Gave a Speech Hoping Entrepreneurs Would Invest in Qingdao</p>
<p>Shen Honglie Will Go to Beijing Today and Return to Qingdao Within a Week</p>
<p>Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie went south to inspect construction projects and domestic industry and commerce. He has been in Shanghai for several days, accompanied by Wang Xiaolai and others to visit. Last night, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the China Production and Sales Cooperation Association, and other eight organizations held a banquet for Shen at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Wang Xiaolai, the chairman, gave a welcoming speech. Shen Ding will go to Beijing today with Gao Lingbai, the secretary of the National Government, and stay for three or four days before returning to Qingdao to resume his duties. The details of the banquet are as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Representatives</p>
<p>The public banquet last night was hosted by the China National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the China National Products Production and Sales Cooperation Association, the China National Products Maintenance Association, the Shanghai Citizens Promoting National Products Association, the Joint Association of Machine-Made National Products Factories, the China General Federation of Industry, and the Shanghai Daily Press Association. Lin Kanghou, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Du Yuesheng, Zhao Jinqing, Gao Hongen, Wu Zhihao, Chen Zheqing, Ying Jingxiu, Wang Boqi of the Daily Press Association, He Xiya, Qian Hua, Mi Jifang, Wu Dong, Xu Xinyi, Ren Shigang, Fang Jiange, Sun Daosheng, Chen Yiting, Pan Yangyao, Wang Jiean, Wang Xingyi, Fang Yexian, Cai Shengbai, Hu Xiyuan from the national products industry, and Li Dachao, the representative of the municipal government, Wu Xingya, the director of the Social Affairs Bureau, and dozens of other people attended. The Datong Music Society played national music to add to the fun.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>Chairman Wang Xiaolai gave a welcoming speech, saying: (Excerpt above) Mayor Shen has always taken the prosperity of Qingdao as his mission, and the colleagues of the various organizations present here today are also dedicated to the industrial and commercial sectors, seeking to develop the national economy and contribute to its improvement. Therefore, today's grand meeting can be regarded as a conversation meeting where like-minded people respond to each other, seek common ground, and express their aspirations. I dare to offer my humble opinion to Mayor Shen as a small suggestion. In recent years, the eastern province of northern China has been the most stable, and cotton, wheat, and peanuts are its main products. The raw materials needed by factories are generally available. Before the fall of the three northeastern provinces, many people from Shandong Province went to the northeast to make a living every year. Now that Shenyang has changed, this route has been cut off, and there is a danger of overpopulation. Qingdao has the convenience of water and land transportation, and there are abundant raw materials and surplus labor nearby. In the whole country, it is not only a commercial port for the distribution of goods, but also a rare industrial area. Today, Shanghai merchants are planning to make Qingdao a sales area, and it seems that they should go a step further and make Qingdao an investment area. This idea should be agreed upon by Mayor Shen and all of you present here. From another perspective, the Japanese military aggression has been successful, and they are taking a further step to seek so-called economic control. Last year, Japanese merchants held a meeting in northern China, and there was a proposal to make Qingdao the economic development center. At the same time, Japanese newspapers also proposed to cooperate with the Fuku Company to build a railway from Qingdao to the northwest. Therefore, although Qingdao is under the sovereignty of our country today, the Japanese, after being complacent in the northeast, are even more ambitious to covet it than before the return of Qingdao before 1922. If we do not seek our own interests, others will take our place. Preserving the rights and interests of Qingdao and seeking the prosperity of the city's economy is indirectly consolidating Qingdao's national defense. The key to this is something that must be explained to all of you present here. The crisis in northern China today lies in the fact that vagrants collude with traitors to incite the masses to cause trouble. If it succeeds, they will enjoy the benefits; if it fails, they will sacrifice the lives of our poor people as tools for their risky and opportunistic actions. There are too many unemployed poor people in our country, who are often willing to be used by these people for a price of ten or twenty yuan. This is evidenced by the recent case cracked in Qingdao. According to the confession of Sun Zuochen, the small leader, he used to work in the Zhongyuan Factory and later made a living by selling fish due to unemployment. He was tempted by the promise of thousands of yuan if the matter succeeded and went against his conscience. Therefore, to prevent the collusion of vagrants today, we must first stabilize people's livelihood so that they do not rebel to survive. Otherwise, the so-called traitors will be too numerous to be executed and too numerous to be arrested. The opinion of our association and others is that revitalizing Qingdao's industry is the way to ensure Qingdao's security. That is the idea. Fortunately, we met Mayor Shen in Shanghai, and the meeting was a good opportunity for cooperation between Qingdao and Shanghai. I would like to briefly describe my thoughts and await Mayor Shen's correction, and offer a toast to wish Mayor Shen success in benefiting Qingdao City, so that the prosperity of Qingdao City in the future will be on par with that of Shanghai, or even surpass it.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Shen's Reply <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>After the chairman finished speaking, Shen stood up and replied, saying: "I remember that I went to Ping thirteen years ago, and I went to Hangzhou fourteen years ago and passed through Shanghai. What I saw then is very different from today. The prosperity of Pudong today and the desolation of the past are the manifestations of the progress of Shanghai's commercial market. Furthermore, Shanghai is like the head of the body in the country, and everything depends on it. The competition among countries in the Shanghai market makes us unable to be optimistic. At the same time, if the rural areas in the country are bankrupt and we urgently seek to revitalize them, then the Shanghai financial community has the power to adjust the economy. We should enable Qingdao and Shanghai to communicate in the future, and the prosperity of Qingdao will depend on the support of Shanghai. I have gained a deep understanding of industry, commerce, and education through the provinces of Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang during this trip south. Ultimately, they all take Shanghai as a model. In this understanding, I feel that (1) the organization of various parts of the country is unsound and the activities are not good, and (2) all industries, whether agricultural, industrial, or commercial, are outdated, resulting in slow progress in the future. When it comes to the Qingdao issue, we all have a painful history. After our country took over, there are now 15,000 foreigners, 4,000 to 5,000 Europeans and Americans, and a total of 20,000 foreigners in Qingdao. The relationship between Qingdao and the international community is constantly threatened by strong neighbors. It is my duty to do everything to protect the country and the people. As for the education and economic issues in Qingdao, let's not talk about education for now. What will happen to the Jiaoji Railway in the future, what about agriculture and commerce? Although I cannot be confident that the results will be good, I will uphold the government's prestige and take care of the people's interests, and I will do my best for the country. Nine years ago, the Economic Investigation Group went to Qingdao, and other groups went to Qingdao one after another, which fully demonstrated their concern for Qingdao. Although the situation in northern China is difficult at this time, and we are always in danger, I believe that if the whole country is willing to work hard and work together, it will not be difficult to overcome the difficulties. Finally, I would like to say that the transportation between Qingdao and Shanghai is very convenient now. I hope that you can come to Qingdao to guide us from time to time, and the future of Qingdao will surely progress day by day."</p>
<h3 id="e108">Yunnan Fellow Villagers Association Cables for Surveying of the Ban Hong Border <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Urges the Government to Protest to Britain and Quickly Withdraw Troops</p>
<p>Both Countries Should Send Senior Officials to Impartially Survey the Border</p>
<p>The Yunnan Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai cabled the National Government and the Yunnan Provincial Government, saying: "Your Excellency the National Government, it has been many days since British troops occupied Ban Hong. Although the people of Yunnan have unanimously opposed it, the British have not shown any remorse. Such blatant aggression is related to the country's territory. How can our provincial government not strictly stop it and deal with it carefully? The opinion of our association is that first, we should make a serious protest to the British government, ordering the British troops to quickly withdraw to their original defense and stop all construction projects, so that Ban Hong can be completely restored to its original state. Second, although the British occupation of Ban Hong has other intentions, the uncertain border is the cause of the conflict. We should take this opportunity to propose that the governments of both countries send senior officials to impartially survey the border and measure all the places that were once regarded as detached. The boundary between this territory and that territory is intertwined, and how can we ignore the means of national defense? The sage Yang Yiqing said that we should be prepared when there is nothing to do and be calm when there is something to do. This saying is most worthy of emulation by people today. We should ask the provincial government to strengthen the border defense of Yunnan Province and strive to enrich it. Do not delay any longer, so that we can be prepared for any eventuality. The above three points are related to safety and danger, and we dare not remain silent. The situation is urgent, and we look forward to immediate action. Yunnan is fortunate, and the country is fortunate." The Yunnan Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai</p>

<p>Recently, More Than 7,000 Tons Have Been Shipped Out</p>
<p>The Value is Over Four Million Yuan</p>
<p>Dagong News Agency reports that tea bricks are a special product of our country. No other country competes in the Soviet Russian market, so the quantity exported to Russia is quite large. Since the end of last year, the Soviet Union has purchased no less than 10,000 tons of new and old tea bricks in our country, which is a very large amount. It is said that these large quantities of tea bricks are currently stored in warehouses in Shanghai, Hankou, and other places, waiting to be shipped to Russia by ship. Two Russian ships that entered the port the other day have already carried away more than 7,000 tons and set sail from Shanghai for Vladivostok, and then transshipped to Moscow. It is also said that the total value of these 7,000 tons of tea bricks is estimated to be over four million yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Decline of Chinese Silk in England <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Due to uneven silk quality and poor reeling techniques.</p>
<p>Japanese Silk Seizes the Chinese Silk Market in England</p>
<p>According to a recent announcement from the Guidance Department of the International Trade Bureau, the sales of Chinese raw silk in the United Kingdom have been declining year by year, while the sales of Japanese raw silk have been increasing annually. In 1930, Chinese silk sales were over 270,000 pounds, while Japanese silk sales were over 660,000 pounds. In 1931, Chinese silk sales increased to 320,000 pounds, but Japanese silk sales soared to over 1.21 million pounds. Last year, Chinese silk sales plummeted to just over 209,000 pounds, while Japanese silk sales surged to over 1.8 million pounds, accounting for more than half of the UK's total annual imports (the United States' total annual imports are over 2.36 million pounds). Within three years, the ratio between China and Japan has shifted from 1 to 3 to 1 to 10.</p>
<p>The reasons for the decline of Chinese silk are uneven silk quality. Eighty percent of raw silk imported into the UK is used to make women's silk stockings. Currently, most factories use Japanese silk. Furthermore, Chinese raw silk reeling techniques are poor, and British factories often have to re-spin Chinese raw silk, making it expensive and uneconomical. Recently, some Chinese silk producers have begun to imitate Japanese reeling methods, which are more popular. However, to improve raw silk, we must start with fundamentally improving silkworm breeds and rearing methods. The National Economic Council has recently hired experts to collaborate with provincial construction departments and agricultural colleges to reform silkworm breeds. After a few years, China's silk trade may be able to restore its former glory.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Shanghai West Sanitation Workers' Strike <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Dispute Arises Over Collection of Subsidies</p>
<p>Nineteen Workers Detained and Sent to the Bureau</p>
<p>Dago News Agency reports: Sanitation workers in the Shanghai West District earn only three to four yuan per month. These workers recently reported that their income is meager and their lives are quite difficult. Therefore, they requested the Third District Sanitation Workers' Union to request that each household allocate a monthly subsidy of 15 cents, following the precedent of the British and French concessions and the North and South Municipalities. After receiving the report, the union, believing that the workers' livelihoods were indeed difficult, immediately notified all households to start collecting from March 31st.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Police劝阻 <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>As for the households, some agreed to pay, but many objected and reported it to the Sixth District Public Security Bureau, requesting that it be stopped. After receiving the report, the Sixth District Bureau invited union directors to the district to劝阻, and also reported it to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for verification. The Shanghai Public Security Bureau approved the reply, stating that the workers' collection of subsidies was not approved by the competent authorities in advance, which was procedurally incorrect, and ordered proper劝阻. After receiving the order, the district sent police to advise the workers against it, but the workers, citing their difficult livelihoods, said that they could not obey.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Workers Arrested <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The workers were outraged after the police discouraged them from collecting fees. Thus, at around 7:00 AM yesterday morning, they pushed and pulled several dung carts, parked them in front of the Sixth District 总署, demanding permission to collect subsidies. The police局 believed that the workers dared to gather and cause trouble, and blocked the police局 with dung carts, which was illegal, so they arrested 19 workers, including Wan Ronghua, Wang Qinggui, and He Dingxiang. After a preliminary trial by the 区长, they were ordered to prepare a document to the 总局 for dispatch.</p>

<p>The United Association of Domestic Machine-Made Factories in the City previously submitted a request to reduce the heavy tax levied by the Hunan Finance Department on domestic sulfuric acid. Yesterday, the approval order was received, stating: "The request to exempt sulfuric acid production and sales tax is known. This case was previously submitted to the department by Kaicheng Acid Manufacturing Co., Ltd., and it was approved, stating, 'It is found that the sulfuric acid produced by the company is a necessary raw material for the factory, and for the purpose of resisting foreign goods, it is specially allowed to levy a tax of seven points per ten pounds according to the newly determined tax rate, and then reduce the tax by half to show promotion.

<h3 id="e139">The Reason for Adjusting Train Schedules on Two Lines <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>The new train schedules for the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo lines, which took effect on the first of this month, have been reported in this newspaper several times. It is said that the main reason for the railway authorities' revision of the schedules is the mandatory modification of the operating times of the Shanghai-Peiping through trains No. 301 and 302. Train No. 301 departs from Peiping at 3:05 PM and arrives in Shanghai at 7:55 AM on the third day. Train No. 302 departs from Shanghai at 4:05 PM and arrives in Peiping at 10:29 AM on the third day. The entire journey has been reduced from two days and two nights to two nights and one day, in order to save travel time between Shanghai and Peiping. At the same time, the schedules of all passenger trains on both lines have been re-arranged to meet current passenger transport needs. Its advantages, not found in previous schedule revisions, are three: (1) Major passenger trains on the Beijing-Shanghai line are connected with those on the Tianjin-Pukou line. In addition to the Shanghai-Peiping through train, such as the seventh Beijing-Shanghai express train and the first Tianjin-Pukou train, the fifth Beijing-Shanghai overnight express and the third Tianjin-Pukou train, the fourth Shanghai-Beijing express and the second Tianjin-Pukou train, and the sixth Shanghai-Beijing overnight express and the fourth Tianjin-Pukou express, are all connected. (2) Between Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou, in addition to the original Beijing-Zhapu through express train that continues to operate as usual, interval trains have been added. For example, the Beijing-Shanghai line's down train No. 15, the Zhenjiang-Shanghai mixed interval train, connects with the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo line's down train No. 41, the Shanghai-Jiaxing mixed interval train. The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo line's up train No. 40, the Jiaxing-Shanghai mixed interval train, connects with the Beijing-Shanghai line's up train No. 16, the Shanghai-Zhenjiang mixed interval train. All use the same train cars to operate as a through train between Zhenjiang and Jiaxing, and passengers do not need to change tickets or trains at the North Shanghai Station. (3) The arrival times of major passenger trains on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo lines are also connected. On the down direction, such as the Beijing-Shanghai line's train No. 5 connecting with the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo line's train No. 31, the Shanghai-Zhapu express train, and the seventh Beijing-Shanghai express connecting with the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo line's train No. 35, the Shanghai-Zhapu express. On the up direction, the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo line's train No. 36, the Zhapu-Shanghai express, and train No. 32, the Zhapu-Shanghai special express, are both connected with the Beijing-Shanghai line's sixth overnight express train. Furthermore, after train No. 301 arrives in Shanghai, it can connect with the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo line's train No. 33, the Shanghai-Zhapu express train. After the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo line's train No. 34, the Zhapu-Shanghai express train, arrives in Shanghai, it can connect with train No. 302, which is particularly convenient for passengers between Hangzhou and Shanghai. In addition, the up train No. 2, the Zhapu-Beijing through express, is advanced to depart from Zhapu at 7:45 AM, arrive in Shanghai at 12:25 PM, depart from Shanghai at 1:00 PM, and arrive in Beijing at 7:35 PM, which is two hours earlier than the previously scheduled time, to facilitate up-bound through passengers between Hangzhou, Shanghai, and Beijing. Also, the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo line's train No. 31, the Shanghai-Zhapu express train, which was originally scheduled to depart from Shanghai at 9:15 AM and arrive in Zhapu at 2:15 PM, is now changed to depart from Shanghai at 7:50 AM and arrive in Zhapu at 12:50 PM, an advance of one hour and twenty-five minutes, allowing passengers from Shanghai to Hangzhou and Zhapu to arrive earlier. Since the implementation of this timetable, travelers have praised its convenience.</p>

<p>Burial at 3 PM</p>
<p>Lu Xinggong, a pioneer of the Chinese revolution, died of heart disease at his residence in Peiping on June 12 last year. At that time, because the Japanese bandits occupied North China and Peiping and Tianjin were in imminent danger, his family, in order to uphold the deceased's lifelong ambition of worrying about the country and forgetting personal matters, did not inform relatives and friends, so very few people outside knew about it. Now his family has scheduled to receive the post in Peiping on March 29, originally scheduled to transport the coffin to Shanghai on March 31, and bury it on April 3. It is now learned that a telegram from Peiping states that it is approved to arrive in Shanghai on April 4. On the same afternoon at 1 PM, the procession will depart from the North Station and be buried at 3 PM in the Shanghai Municipal Council Cemetery on Hongqiao Road.</p>

<p>The Chinese Jisheng Association, because on the evenings of March 5th and 6th, more than 1,700 thatched shacks were burned down in two locations in Zhabei, Pushan Road and Jingjiang Road. The association, together with the Zhabei Charity Group, jointly operated a congee distribution at the Liuying Road Congee Factory. Members were dispatched to investigate and issue congee vouchers. The factory opened for congee distribution on March 13th and was completed on March 30th. The original investigation found that there were 2,777 extremely poor disaster-stricken households, and congee vouchers were issued. 11 shi of rice was needed for congee every day, and the cost of labor and other expenses was about more than 100 yuan. A total of 18 days cost 1,828.78 yuan. It is reported that the association has already prepared and submitted a list. Recently, there have been frequent fires in Zhabei, and the poor people are sleeping in the open air and eating in the wind, which is very pitiful. Unfortunately, the disaster relief funds are insufficient, and the relief cannot be widespread. It is hoped that all charitable people at home and abroad will have ways to improve the situation.</p>

<p>The Municipal Cooperation Promotion Association believes that it is necessary to deliberate on the entire approach to promoting cooperation and the standardization of cooperative terminology. Therefore, in August last year, it sent representatives Shi Boyan and Chen Weifan to Beijing to request the Ministry of Industry to convene a National Cooperation Conference.

The cooperative regulations have been passed by the Legislative Yuan at the regular meeting on February 16 and promulgated. Now, Chen Weifan, the director of the general affairs department of the association, has again submitted a document to the Ministry of Industry, requesting it to convene the National Cooperation Conference as soon as possible, gathering cooperative personnel and cooperative experts from various provinces and cities in one place to discuss the entire strategy for promoting cooperation, the standardization of cooperative terminology, and the separate issues of various provinces and cities.</p>
<h3 id="e148">The Truth Behind Ding Zhongfu's Impersonation of a Lawyer <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Lawyer Ding Shimin Has Understood</p>
<p>Lawyer Ding Shimin filed a lawsuit with the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office, accusing Ding Zhongfu (from Fenghua) of impersonating his lawyer's name, privately engraving a seal, and damaging credit, and requesting a thorough investigation. Upon instruction, the police arrested and detained Ding Zhongfu. Later, Ding Zhongfu asked someone to intercede with Ding Shimin, requesting exemption from prosecution. Ding Shimin agreed, so Cao Changling, the prosecutor, summoned Ding Shimin the other day to question Ding Zhongfu, who was in custody. Ding Zhongfu published an apology in the newspaper for the part of damaging credit, and Ding Shimin was satisfied and withdrew the case in court. The public prosecution part still needs to be carried out. Ding Zhongfu was released on bail pending further instructions. It is now learned that Ding Zhongfu has been ordered to be summoned for further questioning, but Ding Zhongfu did not appear as summoned. It is heard that he will be ordered to turn over the bail for verification and seizure. The cause of this case is that a person in the court wrote to lawyer Ding Shimin, stating that he had been defrauded of 149 yuan by Ding Zhongfu impersonating Ding Shimin, and the person avoided meeting him. Ding Shimin immediately investigated Ding Zhongfu's address and later learned that Ding Zhongfu initially lived at 25 Shenyuli, Tangjia Lane, North Shanghai, and later moved to 22 Yideli, Penglai Road in the city. Sun Huanting found Ding Zhongfu at the address and took him to the police station of the Second District, Second Precinct. Ding Zhongfu admitted to returning the full amount of money to settle the matter. The next day, Ding Shimin also went to Ding Zhongfu's house and found a stack of files and two Ding Shimin seals on the table. Ding Shimin then took the seals back and reported to the Lawyers Association, and the case was discovered.</p>

<p>On March 14th, at 8:30 AM, the home of Xu Qilin, a native of Shaoxing, at 21 Beijing Road, was broken into and robbed of valuables worth 540 yuan. The criminals fled to Room 225 of the Dadong Hotel on Yinhua Street, Nanjing Road. While dividing the spoils, they were secretly investigated by Wei Jinfu, a Chinese detective chief of the Hongkou Police Station, and detectives Zhang Desheng and Wang Zhusheng. They went to the address and arrested the criminals Chen Qiaosheng, Chen Zhongyi, Li Agui, and Chen Linsheng. Three guns, 24 bullets, and a part of the original loot, watch ring, paper money, and silver coins were confiscated and taken to the police station. It was investigated that between October 4th of last year and March 20th of this year, these people, along with their accomplices, held weapons and robbed Xu Detang at 14 Yileli, Foch Road, Lu Quanrong at 3 San Deli, Meibai Road, Hong Tingyi (an agent of the Public Security Bureau) at 75 Xinzha Road, Fei Qinxian at 26 Tangshan Road, Zhu Tifang at 18 Beijing Road, and Xu Chenshi in a bungalow on East Hanbi Li Road, of clothing and silver worth more than 1,300 yuan. They also attempted to rob Jiang Lichu at 5 Xizang Road and Yang Nahong at 10 Zhejiang Road twice without success. At that time, an accomplice, Zhu Genfa, fired a gun and injured Jiang, who died. They were escorted to the First Special District Court for questioning and sentencing. Yesterday morning, Judge Fen presided over the Third Criminal Court and questioned the defendants about their names and origins. Wang Yaotang, a lawyer from the Municipal Council, stated that one of the pistols, No. 462839, and eight bullets were robbed from Hong Tingyi, an agent of the Public Security Bureau at 75 Xinzha Road.

<p>Listed Names Include Traitors Zhang Jinghui and Others</p>
<p>Police Consider it Fraud and Arrest Them Together</p>
<p>Recently, a Russian named Ma Xing Sanbin Bobich pretended to be an employee of the Joint General Association of the World Charity Association of the Puppet Manchukuo (i.e., the White Swastika Society) to solicit donations from well-known Western doctors in Shanghai. On the 27th of last month, he went to the offices of Dr. Bailly and Dr. Tyrie to solicit donations, with the amount ranging from a minimum of 60 yuan to a maximum of 255 yuan. At that time, the two doctors suspected their behavior and asked them to bring evidence the next day in order to be believed, and informed the police. The next day, the two did bring medals and letters of appointment from the World Charity Association. The unnamed letters of appointment all belonged to well-known traitors of the Puppet Manchukuo. The chairman of the association was the rebel Zhang Jinghui, and the vice-chairmen were Lu Ronghuan, Li Shaogeng, Dai Jingxian, Guo Hanting, Dong Yunfang, Cheng Xuetong, and Liu Yuquan. The police arrested them and escorted them to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Qian Xunjiu, a lawyer from the police station, stated that the defendants were suspected of fraud and that the police still needed to investigate, so he requested permission for detention. After questioning by Judge Deng, he ordered detention and rescheduled the hearing.</p>

<p>Zhu Zengjun Unaware of the Fire</p>
<p>Eight Men, Women, and Children Burned to Death</p>
<p>At 2:05 AM yesterday morning, a fire broke out in the overhanging building at the entrance of Lean Lane, Mongolian Branch Road, north of the Xinzha Bridge in Zhabei, and spread to a total of five buildings on the left and right, burning to death eight men, women, and children. The details are divided as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e155">Observation of the Fire Scene <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Mongolian Branch Road is located north of the Xinzha Bridge, connecting Mongolian Road to the north and Kulun Road to the south. Lean Lane, in addition to the overhanging building, has more than 20 Japanese-style houses, all of which are low-rise buildings. Eight or nine out of ten residents are manual laborers. Each house is inhabited by two or three or four or five households. Moreover, this lane connects to Mongolian Branch Road to the east, but does not connect to the west, with only one entrance and exit usually. Therefore, it is very dangerous in the event of a fire.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Process of the Fire <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>At 2:05 AM yesterday morning, a fire alarm suddenly sounded in the overhanging building at the entrance of this lane. Neighbors on the left and right were awakened from their sleep. However, the residents of the lane were unable to escape, crying and shouting, and the order was in chaos. Fortunately, the police officer at the Wuzhen Road Police Station at that location learned of it early, reported to the Fire Department, and drove to the scene to extinguish the fire. It took more than an hour to extinguish the fire. When the fire was raging, most of the residents in the lane climbed onto the roofs to try to escape.</p>

<p>After the incident, Shen Xiaowu, the landlord of the Second Tu (formerly the Tenth Tu) in that area, was summoned by the Wuzhen Road Police Station of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau to report to the Shanghai District Court requesting an autopsy.

He immediately ordered the preparation of coffins for collection and burial, and summoned Hu Yao, the police chief of the station, for questioning before leaving. Currently, the Chen family's bodies have been collected and buried by Chen Tingfang and the other two, while the Zhu family's bodies are still exposed at the entrance of the Mongolian Branch Road.</p>

<p>Kerosene Up Eight Jiao Per Case</p>
<p>Dagong News reports that the four major kerosene companies in this city, Mobil, Texaco, Asia, and Oil Everywhere, believe that since China increased the import tax on gasoline from the first of this month, the cost of kerosene has increased. In order to avoid losses, they agreed yesterday to uniformly increase prices to make up for the loss of tax payments. The price of kerosene under the New Brand Happiness, Monk Cap, and Brand, etc., has increased by eight jiao per case (two cans). The original price of 6.4 yuan is now 7.2 yuan. Old brands such as Red Star and Yuanbao, etc., have also uniformly increased by eight jiao per case. Gasoline, which was originally sold for seven jiao per gallon, has now uniformly increased to eight jiao. It is planned to continue to increase prices in the future depending on market conditions.

<p>Threatening Suicide and Disclosure of Secrets</p>
<p>Master Li Zuchao Reports to Police, Servant Arrested</p>
<p>Li Zuchao, a native of Ningbo and Deputy Manager of the China United Insurance Company, resided at No. 104 Wuding Road in Shanghai West, enjoying a wealthy household with numerous servants. Chen Jinbao, a native of Changzhou, also served as a servant in the Li family. Four years prior, he was dismissed for a reason and became unemployed, struggling in Shanghai. Recently, his circumstances worsened, leading him to desperate measures. On the 26th of last month, he rented a room at No. 53 Shangbin Hotel in Dasheng Lane, Zhejiang Road, and attempted to extort money from the Li family by phone. However, Li ignored him. Consequently, on the morning of the 1st of this month, Chen wrote a threatening letter and delivered it to the Li family. The letter contained numerous threatening words, vaguely stating that Chen had been unemployed for a long time and could not make a living, so he specifically sent the letter to borrow dozens of yuan. He also accused Li's mother of disreputable behavior, stating that if his request was not granted, he would commit suicide and write a suicide note detailing the history of the Li family for publication in newspapers, etc. He also stated that if they were willing to negotiate, they could come to the Shangbin Hotel. The letter ended with the hotel's phone number and Chen Jinbao's name. After receiving the letter, Li reported the situation to the relevant Gordon Road Police Station. Chinese Detective Cai Liu and Detective Bao Gaohui, posing as Li Zuchao, first called the Shangbin Hotel to inquire. They confirmed that Chen Jinbao was there, and Chen happened to be near the phone, so he answered. He arranged to meet with the detectives at 8 PM that night to receive 80 yuan. Chen, suspecting nothing, sat in the room, happily waiting. Unexpectedly, Li Zuchao and the detectives arrived suddenly and arrested Chen, taking him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special District Court, Criminal Division 8. Police lawyer Gan Jingxian presented the above situation, stating that the defendant was charged with attempted extortion under Article 370 of the Criminal Code and requested prosecution. Subsequently, Li Zuchao testified, stating that he was 24 years old and from Zhenhai. The defendant used to work in his house but was dismissed four years ago. Recently, the defendant repeatedly called, wanting to borrow dozens of yuan, or else he would resort to considerable measures. He ignored him. On the 1st of this month, the defendant sent a letter in his name, asking to meet at the Shangbin Hotel. If he did not agree, he would announce his family's secrets in the newspapers. He then reported to the police station, and the detectives negotiated with the defendant and came to an agreement before arresting him. According to Gao Xingsheng, a witness, he worked as a servant in the Li family. All the phone calls from the defendant were answered by him. First, he asked if the madam was in. He replied that she was not. Then, he asked for the young master (i.e., Li Zuchao), and he still replied that he was not there. Questioned, the defendant confessed that he used to work in the Li family but was dismissed four or five years ago. Being unemployed and unable to make a living, he called Li from the Shangbin Hotel on the 26th of last month, asking to borrow dozens of yuan. Later, due to the lack of results, he wrote a letter stating that if Li did not agree to lend him money, he had no other choice but to commit suicide and write a suicide note for publication, so that everyone would know that he died because of this, and that it would also have a significant impact on Li's reputation. Finally, police lawyer Gan Jingxian rose to argue [omitted]. Judge Liu Yugui verified the confession and ordered the defendant to be detained, awaiting sentencing this week.</p>

<p>Confirmed to Have Died of Lung Disease</p>
<p>Inside Changan Lane, Wusong Road, Hongkou, yesterday morning at dawn, the lane's gatekeeper suddenly discovered a female corpse lying in the alley. The body was naked, covered with rice straw. Next to the corpse was a set of Japanese women's clothing. The woman appeared to be around 30 years old, with facial features and hair resembling a Japanese person. The gatekeeper immediately reported to the Hongkou Police Station, which dispatched detectives to investigate. There were no blood stains around the corpse. Only the woman's left middle finger was found to be broken off. The cause of death could not be determined. The corpse was sent to Fumin Hospital for examination. It was said that she died of lung disease. However, it was still difficult to confirm whether the female corpse was Japanese. Therefore, the police station is currently investigating. The corpse has been transferred to the coroner's office, pending verification of nationality before further action.</p>

<p>Chen Qiufan is Utterly Shameless</p>
<p>Chen Qiufan, a native of Ningbo, is currently 39 years old and works as a dentist. He practiced in Zhabei. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War in previous years, Chen's house was destroyed, and his medical practice plummeted. He moved to a kitchen shed at No. 1248 Dongsiwen Lane on Datong Road. Tang Asheng, a native of Ningbo, works as a carpenter and lives at No. 150 Xisiwen Lane on the same road. His 19-year-old daughter, Tang Wencui, recently suffered from toothache. According to someone, Doctor Chen had a pain reliever to give out. On the afternoon of the 1st of this month at 4 PM, she went to Chen Qiufan to ask for medicine. At that time, Chen happened to be playing mahjong in the Dalai Plank and Coal Shop at No. 79 in the same lane, so she went to the shop to find Chen. Chen then ordered Tang to follow him home to get the medicine. When they arrived at Chen's kitchen shed, he gave her two packets of medicine powder. Later, Chen suddenly made advances towards Tang, asking what she would give him in return after the pain was relieved. Tang replied that she would prepare a gift to thank him. Unexpectedly, Chen's lust suddenly arose. Seeing that Tang was weak and easily bullied, he thought it was an excellent opportunity. He grabbed Tang, first kissing her wildly, then covering her mouth with a handkerchief, pushing her onto the bed, taking off her underwear, and forcibly raping her. The girl was too weak to resist and was eventually raped. Afterwards, he let her go. Tang then cried to her parents about what had happened. Tang As</p>

<p>Those who speak of politics consider the people as one of the three essential elements of a nation. Ancient Chinese books also contain the saying, "The people are the foundation of the state." This is because the prosperity or decline of a nation depends on the strength of the national physique and the quality of its culture. The physique of adults is mostly fixed. Even if physical education is promoted to remedy their weakness, its usefulness is limited, and it is already too late. It is better to forge the physique of children. Furthermore, the knowledge of adults is nearly fixed, and the ignorant are often oppressed by poverty, toiling all day long without time for further study, and their brains are rigid and their memory is dull. It is not like children who are sensitive to impressions. Therefore, those who plan for the nation should first pay attention to children's affairs, to cultivate the foundation of the nation and place the country on a rock-solid foundation. Adults are the already-formed backbone of the nation, while children are the future lifeline of the nation. The importance of their position can be generally seen. Western powers all pay deep attention to children's affairs. The establishment of children's parks and children's libraries has become commonplace. Soviet Russia, as a socialist country, widely establishes nurseries to accommodate the children of farmers and workers, raising and nurturing them with utmost care. This is actively protecting children. Italy, as a fascist country, has the ambition to succeed Rome and dominate the world. Therefore, it specially rewards marriage and allows the firstborn children of all to be baptized in the cathedral. This is actively encouraging reproduction. Germany, after the Great War, suffered deeply, but its determination to seek revenge and revival has never ceased. Moreover, its domestic science is advanced, and all facilities tend to be scientific. In addition to actively training women's physiques, it has recently sterilized 400,000 men and women to select superior genes. These people are all mentally ill or have hereditary diseases. This is moving from active promotion to passive prevention, to cut off bad reproduction in future children. Such attention is given. Moreover, some countries still follow the ancient Spartan method of preserving and eliminating infants. Only China has never valued children's affairs and has never recognized the status of children. In humble self-reference, they do not say "piglet," but call them "puppy." If children are livestock, what status can be spoken of? Throughout China's thousands of years of history, I have never seen the government promote children's affairs, nor have I seen any measures to establish children's affairs. It is said that "after ten years of breeding and ten years of teaching," only King Goujian of Yue once had this affair of rewarding reproduction and paying attention to education. I have not seen another person who did this.</p>
<p>The current situation in China is not a concern about the lack of children but a concern about their lack of health. It is not a concern about the reward of reproduction but a concern about the lack of ways to protect them. Children are so weak, and the decline of the country follows. Therefore, to revitalize China, it is necessary for everyone to recognize the status of children, work hard to build children's affairs, and cultivate the foundation of the country. There are several aspects of affairs that should be carried out:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the physical aspect of children, in the active aspect, such as paying attention to children's cleanliness and hygiene, promoting children's games and sports, and establishing or opening children's parks and sports fields, etc.; in the passive aspect, such as free medical treatment in hospitals and free physical examinations, etc.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the intellectual aspect, such as founding children's newspapers and other publications, establishing children's libraries, holding children's lectures, showing children's educational films, and visiting zoos and museums, etc.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the aspect of relief, such as promoting nursery services, establishing children's education and care homes, or delinquent children's reformatories, etc.</p>
<p>The affairs to be carried out cannot be fully listed. In short, children's affairs are related to the survival of the nation, the civilization or barbarism of society, and the rise or fall of the nation. They are extremely important and great. However, their effects cannot be seen in one or two years, nor can they be seen in five or ten years. It must be after twenty or thirty years. Moreover, their facilities are not sufficient for one village or one township, nor are they sufficient for one county or one province. They must be spread throughout the country. Because of the slowness of seeing results and the magnitude of their affairs, they are neglected by people. China has never regarded children's affairs as a national policy for thousands of years, and there is a reason for this. However, previous generations were all closed off, independent, and dignified. The culture of the four neighbors was very low, and they were all regarded as barbarians. Now, there is strife among nations, and the superior prevails over the inferior. If we do not work hard from the root, we will not be able to save the country from danger and ruin. On this happy Children's Day, in addition to commemorating and celebrating, how can we not pay attention to it?</p>
<h3 id="e167">Everyone Should Take Responsibility <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Wang Xiaolai</p>
<p>We need ten years of breeding and ten years of teaching. Judging from the current situation in China, we don't need breeding for the time being, we only need to protect the children who have already been born, and teach the children who have already been born. Everyone only needs to open their eyes and take a look, and they will see that so many children are wasted every year. The so-called waste is a broad concept, one is the waste of life, and the other is the waste of knowledge. Because of economic conditions, small citizens are born, but they cannot raise them themselves. Because of economic conditions, they are raised to an age that is not yet healthy, and then they are made to do excessive labor, resulting in the sacrifice of the lives of small citizens. This is the so-called waste of life. Because of economic conditions, small citizens are born, but they cannot be educated. Because of economic conditions, the education they receive is not enough for their future use. They are born and grow up, but they only succeed in becoming a soulless shell. This is the so-called waste of knowledge. Children are the masters of the future, and children are the generals of the future, but we waste them for no reason. This reduces our main combat power. How regrettable it is. I hope that everyone will take responsibility to protect children, love children, and educate children, so that these many generals can build their brave bodies and rich knowledge one by one, and fight for the survival of the Chinese nation.</p>

<p>General Meeting Announcement</p>
<p>The announcement of the Children's Day celebration meeting of all sectors of society reads: This year's April 4th is the fourth Children's Day in our country. This meeting has decided that a celebration meeting for Children's Day and a general meeting for the mayor to host children from all over the city will be held in the downtown area of the city government from 9:30 am to 12:00 noon on this morning. We have also separately contacted stores in this city to offer special discounts on Children's Day, hospitals to provide free vaccinations for children, parks to be specially open on Children's Day, allowing children to visit for free, and major daily newspapers to issue special issues on Children's Day. The reason why we attach so much importance to and give preferential treatment to children is that children are the vitality of the country and the life of the nation. Today's adults are the children of the past, and today's children are the adults of the future. Children inherit the careers of adults and continue to promote, create, maintain, and promote the civilization of society. Their responsibilities are both heavy and huge. Adults should respect and care for them. At present, our country is in a national crisis, and the rescuers mostly rely on adults, but for the sake of permanently eliminating foreign troubles and promoting national glory, we must make every effort to find ways for children throughout the country, do our best to plan and maintain, protect their wholeness and achieve their nurturing, strengthen their bodies and enlighten their intelligence. This is not enough to achieve the permanent effect of internal security and external defense. Therefore, various agencies and organizations in this city are happy to advocate and commemorate the commendable and gratifying Children's Day, fearing that the parents of ordinary children in society are not yet aware of it. Therefore, this announcement is made.</p>
<p>National Arts Performance</p>
<p>Today is the fourth Children's Day. Mayor Wu held a commemorative meeting in the square in front of the Municipal Government and held entertainment activities. Regarding national arts, the Municipal National Arts Hall will attend and perform. The programs include boxing, weapons, and wrestling. More than 20 people will participate, including juvenile members. This morning at 9:00 am, the director of the general affairs department of the hall, Chen Xuliang, led the group to the event and also distributed a printed material entitled "Children's Day and National [Arts]" to arouse children's attention to the importance of national arts. The hall also issued the following declaration: Children are the future masters of the country, and their relationship to the prosperity and decline of the country and the strength and weakness of the nation is extremely important. Therefore, all countries in the East and West pay attention to children's affairs, strive for the happiness of children, and cultivate excellent seeds to become healthy citizens. Since recent years, politics in our country have been on the right track, and all kinds of construction have been carried out in order. The plans have made us realize that children's affairs are imminent. Therefore, this year is designated as Children's Year, and [April 4th] of each year is [Children's Day], in order to arouse the attention of people throughout the country to children's affairs, in order to protect the seeds of the Chinese nation and cultivate the future masters of the country. There are many ways to cultivate, but the most important is [National Arts]. Everyone knows that National Arts can temper the body and invigorate the spirit, so there is no need to dwell on it. When the national strength is weak, incidents are frequent, foreign troubles are pressing, and internal disasters have not ended, we should not only make major plans for [breeding] and [training] in the aspect of children, but also people throughout the country should catch up quickly and devote themselves to national arts, train strong and brave physiques to cope with the modern environment. This hall leads the national arts and strives to enable citizens to participate universally. We are now soliciting members, and we give special preferential treatment to juvenile members under the age of 16. We also deeply know the importance of children's affairs and think of ways to popularize national arts. Today, on this Children's Day, our colleagues in the hall are performing national arts, including boxing, weapons, and wrestling, which are divided into categories. Due to time constraints, we can only list a few. There are also several juvenile members who have not practiced for a long time, and their skills are not good, but starting from the bottom and going to the top, and going from near to far, it will be easier to enter the hall in the future than it is for adults. Moreover, the way of national arts is easy to know and easy to practice. It can use the most economical time and method to achieve the greatest results. It is up to the practitioners to have perseverance and consistency to seek it. The revival of the national spirit in the future, and the foundation of strengthening the country and strengthening the nation, all depend on this. All those who are interested in national arts should come.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Japan's Slavish Education in the Northeast <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Rewriting Textbooks to Create Pro-Japanese Puppets</p>
<p>Raising Tuition to Resist Youth Enrollment</p>
<p>(Changchun Correspondence) Japan single-handedly controls the economy, politics, and military of the puppet state in the Northeast. Moreover, it is vigorously implementing its poisonous scheme of cultural aggression in the education of the puppet state. Because the strength of a country is fundamentally based on education, only by enslaving the education of the Northeast can Japan hope that the puppet state will be permanently under its control. Now, the details are collected as follows:</p>
<p>Rewriting Textbooks</p>
<p>Japan attaches great importance to secondary education in the puppet state. Regarding the teaching problem, it had previously elected a committee to specialize in collecting materials. Recently, a committee was held at a middle school in Fengtian. Based on the draft prepared by a member of the committee, other members were compiled and sorted out. It was completed in March of this year. Since the new semester in April, the textbook will be used. The various materials collected by the committee member actually exceeded 1,300 points, compared to the approximately 500 pages selected by the Dalian Committee. At the recent review meeting, 38 middle school principals served as members, and Kuribayashi, a school affairs official from the Japanese Kwantung Office, participated in the meeting. He gave it a strict inspection, and the draft for the slavish education in the Northeast finally emerged. After the occupation of the Northeast by violent Japan, it tried its best to pick up improper explanations and the fallacy that the Northeast and China were not one. There were even insane traitors who were willing to be used by the enemy, fabricate black and white, and cater to Japan's strange arguments.</p>
<p>Changing the School System</p>
<p>The Puppet State's Ministry of Education has issued a notice to all educational affairs bureaus that, starting this spring, all schools in rural villages, in addition to studying the classics, should pay special attention to studying the Wangdao political and legal system of Japan-Manchuria coexistence and co-prosperity. Furthermore, in the school or spare land, they should cultivate and sow various grains by themselves. As for students who study commerce in cities, they should practice industry outside of class, and their works will be sold by the school or entrusted to merchants. Therefore, rural students pay attention to learning farming, while urban students tend to be industrialized, and they have no time to study knowledge. This is the policy of foolish education implemented by the Japanese.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Japanese and Manchu Languages <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>The purpose of the language training institute for staff established by the Puppet State's Ministry of Education is to teach Japanese and Manchu languages to create loyal and tamed puppet talents. Now, the institute has begun to recruit the fourth batch of students. The Japanese language course is set up in the Changchun Public School, and the Manchu language course is set up in the Machi Elementary School. The two courses are divided into four departments, each of which lasts for six months. The Japanese language course will recruit 480 students, and the Manchu language course will recruit 200 students. School began on March 20.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Raising Tuition Fees <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Under the instigation of Japan, the Puppet State plans to start raising tuition fees for the next semester of this year. The annual tuition fee for junior high school is 45 yuan (originally 21 yuan), the miscellaneous fee is 12 yuan (originally 3 yuan), and the uniform fee is 20 yuan, which must be paid in full at the time of admission, for a total of 77 yuan. The annual tuition fee for elementary school is 30 yuan, the miscellaneous fee is 7 yuan, and the uniform fee is 20 yuan, which must also be paid in full at one time, for a total of 57 yuan. (Before the incident, the total cost for elementary school per year was no more than 30 yuan.) According to the current price of Northeast soybeans at 1.2 yuan and sorghum at 0.6 yuan, farmers who cultivate 10 mu of land must be in debt of 2-3 yuan. Small farmers are completely bankrupt, middle farmers can still support themselves, and large farmers suffer even greater losses. Based on this situation, violent Japan is raising tuition fees, intending to make those who cannot afford it unable to attend school at all. They will teach those who can afford it with Japanese-made textbooks to enslave them. This year and beyond, children under the age of seven will disappear from the doors of elementary schools.</p>

<p>The puppet government has been planning to establish a national museum in Shenyang for a long time, but it has not yet made a concrete decision. With the help of the Puppet State's Ministry of Education, it was decided to use Tang Yulin's former residence on Sanjing Road as the site of the museum. It can be established in April. Yuan Jinkai has been appointed as the curator of the museum and is currently preparing everything.</p>

<p>The puppet state stipulates the system for studying abroad. The students sent abroad are all to cultivate diplomatic traitors. The number of students studying abroad has now been decided: three each for England, France, Germany, and the United States, and 120 for Japan. The reason why the number of students studying in Japan is so much larger than that of other countries is to cultivate more pro-Japanese elements.</p>

<h3 id="e179">France's Boxer Indemnity <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>1.  The Motivation for Refund</p>
<p>The movement to refund the French Boxer Indemnity originated around the time of the founding of the Republic of China. At that time, Chinese educators in Europe, including Wang Zhaoming, Cai Yuanpei, Wu Jingheng, Li Yuyi, and Zhang Jingjiang, organized organizations such as the World Society, the China-France Education Association, the Thrift Society, and the Work-Study Society in Paris. Educational undertakings between China and France increased daily, and the public hoped that this would promote goodwill and attention between the two countries, gradually advancing to realize the refund of the indemnity and the undertaking of study.</p>
<p>2.  The Mature Period for Refund</p>
<p>In the sixth year of the Republic of China, the European War was in full swing. Because China and France were both allied countries, China was able to defer payment of the indemnity for five years. By the end of November in the tenth year of the Republic of China, the five-year deferral period had expired. Chinese people believed that the time was ripe to initiate a refund movement, and first established the Sino-French University in Lyon with the French side as a preliminary launch. The French government happened to have a plan to decide on the resumption of business of the Sino-French Industrial Bank, intending to refund the entire remaining amount of the Boxer Indemnity, but it was necessary to first use this fund to rescue the resumption of business of the Sino-French Industrial Bank. From then on, the refund measure gradually became concrete.</p>
<p>3.  The Sino-French Draft Agreement</p>
<p>On June 24, 11th year of the Republic of China, the French ambassador submitted a note to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the former Beijing government. After discussion, both parties agreed to sign an agreement stipulating that the remaining amount of the French Boxer Indemnity would be used to reorganize the Sino-French Industrial Bank and to handle educational undertakings between China and France. Later, the French government again requested that the French Boxer Indemnity be converted into gold yuan (referring to US dollars) for payment. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs rejected this request, but the French side firmly refused to acknowledge this, and the two sides disputed for a long time. By February of the 12th year of the Republic of China, the Beijing government agreed to calculate in gold francs, and public opinion was in an uproar. The National Assembly also opposed it and formally rejected it in a meeting. This matter became a pending case. In the 14th year of the Republic of China, the Beijing government took advantage of the long-term de facto closure of the National Assembly and concluded an agreement with the French ambassador on April 12 of that year, deciding to allocate the French Boxer Indemnity to restore the Sino-French Industrial Bank. Later, the education sector strongly argued, and only then was a small portion obtained to handle education and charitable undertakings between China and France.</p>
<p>4.  Total Refund Amount</p>
<p>The total amount of the French Boxer Indemnity refund was 39,158,1529 francs and 05 centimes. Calculated at a legal gold rate of 5.1826 francs per US dollar, the converted amount in US dollars was $75,556,964.457. This total amount was advanced and borrowed annually in accordance with the agreement to the Sino-French Industrial Bank as a fund for the bank to issue 5% US dollar bonds. The Sino-French Industrial Bank then used these US dollar bonds for four purposes: (1) non-interest-bearing securities held by Far Eastern creditors; (2) handling educational and charitable undertakings between China and France; (3) paying the government's unpaid balance of equity capital; and (4) returning various debts owed by the Chinese government to the Sino-French Industrial Bank.</p>
<p>5.  Amount Allocated for Educational and Cultural Undertakings</p>
<p>Since the 15th year of the Republic of China, the Sino-French Industrial Bank has allocated US$200,000 annually for handling educational and charitable undertakings between China and France. The handling and distribution methods are negotiated annually by representatives of the French government and representatives of the Chinese Ministry of Education. Therefore, the education sector established the Sino-French Education Fund Committee to manage and distribute this fund, and to complete a kind of permanent fund. It has been heard that many Sino-French educational institutions have been subsidized over the years, such as the Shanghai Sino-French Industrial College, the Lyon Sino-French Institute, the Tianjin Naval Medical School, the Tianjin French Advanced Commercial School, the Paris China College, the Peiping Sino-French University, Shanghai Aurora University, French hospitals in Beihai, Qiongzhou, and Yunnan, the Sino-French Cultural Exchange Publishing Committee, subsidies for scholars to come to China to give lectures, and other Sino-French public welfare undertakings, etc., and the purchase of useful books for public viewing.</p>
<p>6.  Committee Organization</p>
<p>The French Boxer Indemnity Committee is named the Sino-French Education Fund Committee. Its organization is composed of representatives from both China and France. The Chinese members are one representative from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, one representative from the Ministry of Finance, one representative from the Ministry of Education, one representative from National Peking University, one representative from National Southeast University, one representative from Guangdong University, and one representative from Sino-French University. The French members are the French ambassador to China or his representative. The above two parties each have one vote during voting. Their functions are based on the Sino-French agreement to manage the Sino-French education undertaking fund and decide its uses.</p>
<p>7.  List of Current Committee Members</p>
<p>The Chinese delegation consists of Li Yuyi, Shen Yinmo, Yi Peiji, Liu Xichang (also secretary), Xiao Yu (also resident secretary and staff member of the Chinese delegation), and Xiao Wenxi. The French delegation consists of Wei Dun, Ba Er, and Han Dewei.</p>

<h3 id="e182">Ministry of Education Provides Relief to Northeastern Youth Domestically and Abroad <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education has established a Northeast Youth Education Relief Office within the Ministry of Education to provide relief to Northeastern youth. For the sake of convenient and close handling of affairs, an office has been established in North China. The head of the office, Zhou Tianfang, previously received orders from the Ministry to inspect higher education in Peiping and Tianjin. The deputy head, Li Xi'en, has been extremely busy in North China preparing for the establishment of Zhongshan Middle School and providing relief to youth who have lost their opportunity to study. It is heard that for the first round of enrollment for Zhongshan Middle School, many people applied for the exam. Several hundred of the applicants were admitted, and the names were announced on March 26. Because the quota is 600 students, more than two hundred students are still needed. It is heard that the second round of examinations is scheduled for April 5. Based on the large number of applicants for the previous exam, the number of examinees for this session should be very enthusiastic. After admission, the students will officially enroll. This is a domestic youth education relief method. It is heard that there are four Northeastern students studying in various countries in Europe and the United States. Recently, they submitted requests stating that due to the fall of the Northeast, their subsidies were unavailable and they requested relief from the Chinese government. The Ministry of Education has ordered the Relief Office to draft relief measures for review and approval. However, the Ministry of Education has already instructed the embassies abroad to investigate the situation of Northeastern youth among the students studying abroad, and after the investigation and reply, to formulate comprehensive relief measures so that the foreign students in general may receive appropriate relief.</p>

<h3 id="e186">Gansu Education Department Director Shui Chuchen Arrives in Shanghai to Discuss the Current Situation of Gansu Education <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Total accumulated debt reaches 434,824 yuan</p>
<p>Annual deficit of 265,645 yuan</p>
<p>Gansu Province Education Department Director Shui Chuchen recently came south to Nanjing in order to make requests to the Ministry of Education, visited Minister Wang, and presented everything in person. He has already completed his official business and then came to Shanghai for business, staying at the East Asia Hotel. He then went to Hangzhou and returned to Shanghai yesterday. He published a detailed account of the current situation of education in Gansu, which is recorded below:</p>
<p>Number of schools: According to him, there is currently one university (namely Gansu College), fifteen provincial secondary schools, six county-run secondary schools, and one private secondary school. There are eleven provincial higher primary schools, 139 county-run higher primary schools, 64 district-run higher primary schools, and eight private higher primary schools. There are twelve provincial elementary schools, 726 county-run elementary schools, 867 district-run elementary schools, and 79 private elementary schools. There are two provincial kindergartens and one private kindergarten. In total, there is one university, 22 secondary schools, 1,896 elementary schools, and three kindergartens.</p>
<p>Number of students: Currently, the number of students receiving education includes 180 male university students, 1,772 male secondary school students, 128 female secondary school students, 84,571 male elementary school students, 3,716 female elementary school students, and 93 kindergarten students. In total, there are 90,366 male and female students. There are 846,548 children who do not have the opportunity to study.</p>
<p>Sources of funding: Divided into (A) provincial funds, (B) local county funds, and (C) private funds. One university requires an annual expenditure of 96,236 yuan. Twenty-two secondary schools require an annual expenditure of 303,386 yuan. 1,896 elementary schools require an annual expenditure of 324,063 yuan. The total annual expenditure is 723,685 yuan. There are also 287 social public education institutions with an annual expenditure of 3,516 yuan. There are 66 students sent to various universities in the country with an annual expenditure of 11,795 yuan, and one student studying in France with an annual expenditure of 2,880 yuan. In total, the annual expenditure for various educational undertakings in the province should be 849,995 yuan. After deducting the 515,639 yuan from the provincial funds, there is an annual deficit of 265,645 yuan.</p>
<p>Accumulated debt: Gansu is an extremely poor place, and coupled with years of famine, the land is barren for thousands of miles. Often, only 60% of the assessed land taxes and other taxes are actually collected. Taking education alone, the accumulated expenditure debt for the past two years has reached 434,824 yuan. The debt for five middle schools is 147,124 yuan. The debt for four normal schools is 194,835 yuan. The subsidy debt for domestic university students is 18,181 yuan. The overseas student's debt is approximately 30,000 yuan. There are also teachers' monthly salaries, office equipment fees, etc., which have not yet been included.</p>
<p>Remedies: According to him, Gansu is in dire financial straits, and everywhere one turns, the situation is stretched to the limit. The difficulties have reached an extreme. Not only is it impossible to implement plans for improvement, but even consolidating the current situation is hesitant. Due to the lack of funding and the excessive amount of accumulated debt, the equipment in various schools is also becoming increasingly simple and crude. According to Article 20 of the University Professor Qualification Regulations, the attached salary schedule for university professors lists a monthly salary of 400 to 600 yuan for professors, 260 to 400 yuan for associate professors, 160 to 260 yuan for lecturers, and 100 to 160 yuan for teaching assistants. However, the highest salary at Gansu College is 244 yuan per month. Naturally, famous professors cannot be hired. In addition, due to the inconvenient transportation and harsh living conditions, professors who can be hired for 300 yuan per month in the interior will not agree to be hired in Gansu. If the professors are not good, the students' level will also decline. Therefore, in order to seek remedies, the first priority is to improve teachers' salaries in order to hire famous professors. The accumulated debt should be issued in order to add the required equipment.</p>
<p>Returning to Gansu: Shui said that the purpose of his visit to Nanjing was to make requests to the Ministry of Education regarding the above-mentioned issues. He also brought a detailed draft plan for improvement and presented it to the Ministry of Education for review and approval. Gansu College Professor Sun Zhitian, who led Gansu athletes to Nanjing to participate in the National Games, had already returned to Gansu. Sun was ordered to investigate art education in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and stayed in Shanghai. It is heard that he has completed his task and will return to Gansu with Shui in the coming days.</p>

<h3 id="e188">Schools' Rent Reduction Committee's Letter to Landlords Yesterday <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Please Voluntarily Reduce Rent</p>
<p>The Municipal Schools' Rent Reduction Campaign Committee sent a letter to landlords of various schools yesterday, stating: "Greetings. Education is a social undertaking. There are thousands of schools in this city, most of which are rented. In recent years, rents have been increasing daily, which has hindered the progress of education. To remedy this, our committee has launched a campaign to reduce rents for schools in the city. This campaign directly aims to alleviate the economic burden on schools, allowing education to gradually develop and improve. This would enable nearby tenants to have opportunities and convenience for their children to attend school, and they would not be willing to move easily. This would also indirectly benefit you, the landlords. Therefore, reducing school rents is in the best interest of you landlords. There are no disadvantages, publicly or privately. It is believed that you will deeply agree. It has been decided by the fourth committee meeting that landlords of various schools in the city should be requested to voluntarily reduce rents, as recorded in the minutes. In addition to requesting the Real Estate Association to provide separate notification, this letter is hereby sent for your attention and compliance. Sincerely, Your Friend."</p>

<p>— Zhou Shoujuan</p>
<p>Recently, I often have dreams, often dream of my childhood, and I wish I could turn back time and return to my childhood. Why? Because childhood is always happy, and in a heart like a blank sheet of paper, there is never a trace of worry.</p>
<p>But childhood has passed like flowing water, and the flowing water that has passed cannot be recovered, so childhood cannot be recovered either. At present, the only comfort in my soul is to approach children and make friends with innocent children.</p>
<p>I have been editing this Spring and Autumn Children's Weekly for thirteen issues. Every Saturday, when I am selecting manuscripts and arranging them, it is as if I have transformed myself into an innocent child, jumping and running to the children's garden, accompanying the children to swing on the swing, spin the top, tell jokes, and tell stories.</p>
<p>Today, April 4th, is Children's Day, and this year is also our designated Children's Year. How significant is the meaning of Children's Day in this Children's Year! In order to show my respect for Children's Day in the Children's Year, I have specially opened up the entire publication to publish only the works of children, using the spiritual and intelligent articles of the children,</p>
<p>To contribute to the beloved children across the country, I wish everyone will work hard!</p>
<h3 id="e202">Good Spring Scenery <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Ling, Suzhou Jinghai Elementary School</p>
<p>The days are like giant wheels, turning quickly, and the cruel winter is finally overwhelmed by the warm and beautiful spring. Everything also comes out happily to enjoy this mild spring.</p>
<p>The weeping willows by the pond have grown small, tender leaves on their soft branches. From the green water, you can also see the drooping willow branches, which are like a gentle girl, never angry. The withered yellow grass on the ground struggles to produce many fine shoots. When the sun sets, there are always a group of children playing games and telling stories on the grass. The grass seems to be their necessary friend.</p>
<p>Countless swallows, large and small, come in groups, cross the sea, and fly here to make nests on the beams of people's houses. Sometimes they fly out, soaring and carefree in the boundless and pure sky.</p>
<p>When spring arrives, many trees, large and small, are holding flower buds; some have not bloomed, and some have bloomed with lovely flowers for people to admire. The so-called hardworking bee sisters have already been buzzing in the heart of the flowers to collect honey. Fearing that this good opportunity will not return, they are busy collecting countless sweets and taking them home to store. In short, everything that flies and walks on the ground comes to welcome this spring full of joy.</p>
<p>And the spring breeze is so gentle!</p>
<h3 id="e203">Just Don't Forget It <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>

<p>Mr. Tao, the little joke teller: [Every time I speak to you at the morning meeting, you listen with your east ear and let it out of your west ear, and you never want to remember my words. What is the reason? ··· You have such a lack of memory, I really have no way to help you.]</p>
<p>Student: [Mr. Tao! I have a good idea.]</p>
<p>Mr. Tao: [What idea? Tell me!]</p>
<p>Student: [Just stuff the west ear of everyone with waste paper.]</p>
<p>A gust of wind blows the water, and the water seems to welcome the wind, flowing slightly. It blows the willows, and Mr. Willow sways happily. It blows on people, and people can't help but become gentle. It blows on the flowers, and a burst of fragrance stabs into people's noses. Lovely spring! Don't go back, it is best to stay in the world forever, full of happy air, so that people will not have worries all day and all year round. Spring! Can you do it? Can you do it?</p>

<p>Recently, everyone says that Jie's temperament has changed. That's right! Jie's gentle temperament in the past has disappeared somewhere, and now he is like a wild child running on the street.</p>
<p>Although people say that Jie has turned bad, Jie himself doesn't think so. He only knows that he has started a dream, a dream that is different from the past. What he is doing now is the warrior's dream, and what he did in the past was the good child's dream.</p>
<p>Jie has recently learned to read newspapers. He sees from the newspaper how weak the country he is in is, and this country is not suitable for learning to be a good child. What this country yearns for are strong children who will grow up to fight for the motherland in the future.</p>
<p>Jie believes that every warrior has a violent temperament. Without this violent temperament, this person is not suitable for fighting.</p>
<p>So Jie desperately tries to cultivate a violent temperament, and Jie also believes that every warrior must have a cruel temperament. If warriors are not cruel, how dare they hold the heads of their enemies and laugh! So he first kills some insects, like butterflies, cockroaches, etc., to test his temperament.</p>
<p>The people in the family hate it very much, because they think Jie is too cruel, but Jie himself is very proud.</p>
<p>Although Jie is also a little unhappy, because the people in the family are not as affectionate to him as before. But he comforts himself, he thinks he will always become a warrior in the future, no matter how the people in the family treat him.</p>
<p>So he began to think about learning from Zhao Zilong, the Zhao Zilong who wins every battle, making noise all day long. But this made his family hate him even more, and they said that Jie was getting worse and worse.</p>
<p>But Jie never realized or understood the attitude of his family towards him.</p>

<p>The evolution of the species has no end, and the progress of human life has no end: Before the time of Youchao, people ate wild fruits or the meat of birds and animals, drank the blood of birds and animals, lived in caves, and wore animal skins or leaves, but were often harmed by wild animals.</p>
<p>In the time of Youchao, they built nests with wood to avoid harm from wild animals, which was a little more advanced than before.</p>
<p>When Suiren discovered fire, humans knew how to eat cooked food again. Fuxi invented animal husbandry, raising birds and animals to provide food: humans no longer worried about not having food. However, at this time, walking on water and land was still not very convenient.</p>
<p>The Yellow Emperor invented boats and carts, so we humans no longer had to wade through water; we no longer had to walk. Leizu invented sericulture and silk reeling, and human clothing improved a lot!</p>
<p>Now people eat delicacies and delicacies, wear wool and velvet, live in high-rise buildings, and ride flying</p>

<h3 id="e207">The Crows in Xi'an Tell the Time <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Ma Zhenhua, Attached Elementary School of Xi'an First Normal School</p>
<p>Since I came to Xi'an for the evening holiday, every day when dusk is approaching, I can always see countless crows flying in the sky, calling and looking for their lodgings. The next morning, they are in formation again, rising up with a loud noise. At that time, I was sleeping soundly, and being awakened by it, I couldn't help but feel a little annoyed, and I always said, where did all these crows come from? At the same time, I didn't pay attention. Who knew it would be useful? It wasn't until I entered school that I realized it could tell the time. In this semester, I relied on it to wake me up on time every day and arrive at school on time. Do the children find this strange? Let me write it out and you will understand.</p>
<p>In Xi'an, there is no standard clock. Although the government strikes a large bronze bell to tell the time every day, it is not necessarily accurate. Therefore, the time of each household is not uniform, and there is a big difference. Naturally, the clocks in schools and homes are also different, and there is no way to make them consistent. It is inevitable that students will be late for school, so my parents deliberately set the clock ahead, but it still cannot be remedied. A few days later, our teacher announced a method, ordering us to pay attention to the crowing of the crows in the morning. When it crows for the first time, we get up, when it crows for the second time, we get up from home, and when it crows for the third time, we arrive at school.</p>
<p>At that time, I didn't believe that crows had the ability to tell the time. Since the teacher said so, I had to obey. Every day I paid attention to the crowing of the crows. The crows in Xi'an do not build nests in trees, but spend the night on the roofs of houses, so every household has them, and when they crow, they can be heard very clearly and can wake people up.</p>
<p>So my mother focused on listening to it for me. When the crow crowed, she woke me up, dressed, got out of bed, washed up hastily, and walked out with my schoolbag. At this time, the crow was indeed crowing for the second time, and I ran to school. It was about to crow for the third time. Continuing like this, it soon became a habit, and I was never late and missed my homework. This proves that it can indeed tell the time.</p>

<p>Once, in the countryside, I saw an old man slowly walking on the road. I asked him: [In this state, where are you going?] The old man sighed and said, I am going to chop firewood. I said, [You are so old, can you still chop firewood?] He said, [I have no way to think. If I don’t chop firewood for a day, I won’t have food to eat for a day.] As he spoke, tears flowed down. ]</p>
<p>I asked him why he didn't ask his son to chop firewood. He said: [My son is very bad. He takes the money I buy every day to drink and gamble. He also has a wife, and I have to support her too! ···]</p>
<p>Alas! The fate of this old man can be regarded as extremely tragic. When I heard this, the water in my eyes couldn't help but burst out. At this time, the old man was also crying and couldn't say anything more. I didn't have the courage to ask him again, and in this moment of sorrow, the old man left without saying goodbye.</p>

<h3 id="e209">The Story of the Sheep and the Wolf <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Zechang, Shanghai Minzhi Elementary and Middle School</p>
<p>In the East, there was a fertile field full of tender green grass, where a group of gentle sheep lived, eating grass and living happily every day.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a few brutal wolves came from the East Neighbor, staring fiercely at the sheep, wanting to take them as snacks. The sheep sent representatives to bitterly beg the leader of the wolves: [Mr. Wolf! All things in nature should love each other. We sheep have always advocated peace. Why are you so cruel?] The leader of the wolves sneered: [Hey! Peace! Peace! It is indeed a very pleasant term, but if we take care of your peace, our stomachs will be hungry.] So, in a while, a few wolves tore and devoured a group of peace-loving and non-resistant sheep.</p>
<p>From this story, we can get a lesson and enlightenment: the sheep tried to influence the wolves with peace, but the result was failure. If a group of sheep could seek peace by uniting and resisting, perhaps their fate would not be so cruel! You must know that in the world now, there is no justice, justice is power, and only struggle can lead to final victory!</p>

<p>When Mu'er was twelve years old, his parents were forced by circumstances and the facts did not allow him to continue his studies. In order to train him to be self-reliant in the future, his parents spent half a year entrusting someone to find a shop in Shanghai and send him to be an apprentice. Mu was a very smart child. In less than a year, he already knew everything about the shop, and his master praised him for his diligence.</p>
<p>Time passed like flowing water, and Mu'er was fifteen years old. He had been promoted from apprentice to partner. But his senior brothers all liked to pass the time by gambling. Over time, Mu'er, who was near vermilion and became red, also became a child who liked to gamble. As a result, he owed a lot of gambling debts.</p>
<p>One morning, Mu'er stole a gold ring from one of his senior brothers. When it was discovered later, he had already changed it into money. After a long period of investigation, he was finally caught by a colleague.</p>
<p>In order to rectify the shop rules, the shopkeeper immediately fired Mu'er for stealing, and his parents compensated for the stolen ring. But his reputation could not be recovered.</p>
<p>Children! Remember that stealing is a shameful thing, reputation is the second life of a person, and also remember the words of the ancients [Near vermilion, one becomes red].</p>

<p>What is the most precious thing in the world? I think everyone knows it. That is, the brain and hands that each of us has. Why? Because the brain can think, can invent, and the hands can write and do things. If there is no thought, there will be no invention. Without invention, our society will not progress. If thoughts are not spread through words, and no one does what is invented, our world will not be so brilliant.</p>
<p>Each of us has these two treasures. But although we have these two treasures, we must use them, otherwise it is better not to have them.</p>
<p>The only way for us to use our brains and hands is to read more and learn more, because reading more can make our minds sharp, and learning more can make our hands omnipotent. Therefore, we must read and learn when we are young.</p>
<p>Children get up early every day, go to the yard to practice morning exercises, and after dinner, carry their schoolbags to school. The posture of walking should be as good as in the picture.</p>

<p>My younger brother, Zushun, is five years old this year and naturally intelligent. My father teaches him to read in his spare time, starting from the age of four. By this year, he knows more than a thousand characters, and can explain each one. This is certainly due to his innate intelligence, but also to my father's good teaching methods. I am writing this down now as a reference for home education.</p>
<p>My father teaches my younger brother to read, starting with the names of objects. According to my father, "[Objects are often seen, so they can be easily remembered]." Therefore, before teaching, my father first familiarizes my brother with the object, and then writes the name of the object for my brother to recognize. He only needs to teach it two or three times to be able to recognize it. This method is simple and easy to implement. When teaching descriptive or abstract words, he first teaches him to speak, so that he understands the meaning first, and then writes the word for him to recognize. Therefore, my younger brother can easily recognize any kind of word. I am now writing down this method of teaching young children to read and submitting it to the "Spring and Autumn Children's Weekly" as a contribution to our young friends.</p>

<p>— Zhou Shang</p>
<p>It seems that this generation of sleeping lions cannot be awakened, but we should always rock and awaken the little sleeping lions of today. The little sleeping lions of today are the next generation of citizens, the children of today. The revival of our nation depends entirely on the children of today. I hope that the children of today will no longer be like us, so unable to wake up, so inferior to others, so useless. From an early age, we should pay attention to their happiness. The foundation of children's happiness should be built on health. Only healthy children have true happiness, and only happy children can bear the heavy responsibility of saving the country. I believe that the most immediate goal of childhood is to seek the happiness of the children themselves, and the ultimate goal of childhood is to achieve national revival. We should grasp these two points and not let them go easily.</p>
<p>Health is the key to the door of happiness. With this key, any difficulty can be solved. Perhaps from now on, we will not be afraid of foreign devils, and from now on, we will not be afraid of airships and tanks. Originally, "[A nation with third-rate physiques cannot build a first-rate country]," and originally, "[A golden age of culture must be preceded thirty years earlier by a golden age of national health]." The former was said by British Prime Minister George, and the latter was said by American psychologist Hall. These two famous sayings are reflections of reality, and we should think about them deeply. The meaning of health lies in enabling individuals to have a rich life and make the greatest contribution. Children's health must start with three major areas: "[diet]," "[exercise]," and "[rest]." "[The people take food as their heaven]," food is the most important thing, but if food is not obtained in the right way, if one eats too much or too little, if one eats at the wrong time, or if one eats the wrong things, the development of children will inevitably be hindered. Therefore, one must be careful about diet from a young age. Some parents seem to show off and tell everyone, "[Our darling doesn't like to eat green vegetables and tofu]," but in fact, the child actually likes to eat green vegetables and tofu, but as a result of such suggestion, they don't want to eat them anymore. They don't know that vegetables and beans are the treasure of nutrition. Many children fall into the hands of inexplicable things, and don't know how much they are wasting.</p>
<p>To only talk about eating and neglect exercise is called eating for nothing. If you eat but don't get any good out of it, then you have to talk about exercise. Constant muscle activity can enhance the body's developmental power. At the same time, it is also beneficial to posture, digestion, excretion, and mental health. Wise adults should guide them to spend two or three hours every day in fresh air and sunlight, engaging in exercise with enthusiasm. Walking, running, tug-of-war, rope skipping, boxing, mountain climbing, swimming, kicking shuttlecock, and rolling iron hoops are all exercises that don't cost money. Modern parents should understand that children are naturally active, and should let them move. Don't encourage children to wear long gowns and mandarin jackets, and not allow them to move or speak, with a hundred "[no's]," restricting the lively children, making them unable to move, and pretending to have the air of "[old beyond their years]!" Save them! Let them move as they please! Let them retain the spirit of "[hale and hearty in old age]," to struggle for this old nation.</p>
<p>Eating, playing, and working all day long, but not getting enough rest, is still not perfect. Therefore, children should rest when they are tired. Rest is the natural requirement of the body. After doing something for twenty or thirty minutes, one should rest for a while. There is now a proposal that the teaching time in elementary schools should not exceed forty minutes, and each lesson should have a break of more than twenty minutes, which is worth studying. Sleep can also be included under rest. Children are young, so they should sleep more. Ordinary children should sleep with the windows open for thirteen to eleven hours. Sleep helps growth, repairs cells, and restores energy. The more children like to sleep, the healthier they are, and the happier they are. I hope parents will pay attention to this.</p>
<p>Rock the cradle, awaken the sleeping lion, rock it with all your strength, until the lion roars in anger.</p>

<h3 id="e218">Thoughts on Children's Day <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Zhiyao</p>
<p>Recently, an author in a famous literary magazine described the scene of his ideal country like this:</p>
<p>"[The city is like a park, with the dense shade of trees protecting the wildflowers. On the clean roads, you can't see a crazy man, a coquettish woman, or a dirty child. Those going to school and those going to work all walk with their chests held high, their faces glowing, greeting each other with an uncontrollable smile, as if everyone knows each other. ]"</p>
<p>"[The blue sky goes away, the starlight gradually appears, and the children are all in warm beds, smiling at the sky in their dreams under the wide-open doors]."</p>
<p>Yes, only in such a peaceful society can there be these happy children.</p>
<p>The mainstay of society is adults, and the lives of adults are bound by countless ingrained habits. For traditional and self-interested reasons, they hate their fellow beings, abuse women, and look down on children. All kinds of mistakes and sins have made people's real lives very painful, and everyone is pursuing a vague future and ideals.</p>
<p>Poor children, some even before they are born, already have sinful elements in their cells. When they come into the world, they are afflicted with incurable diseases for the rest of their lives, or suffer from painful torture, and have to end their lives immediately.</p>
<p>Although most children are called "[innocent]," their "[innocence]" is praised on the one hand, and abused on the other. Suddenly, their black eyes are covered with a layer of dim yellow, and their yelling mouths speak a set of words that they themselves don't understand. Their hands and feet are also locked up. Adults say, "[This child has been educated]."</p>
<p>Now, some people are loudly calling for saving the children, but they seem to have forgotten the society on which the children depend. What kind of society, what kind of children. To save the children, you must first save this society. If we regard protecting children and improving children's lives as the first step in awakening to transforming adult lives, it seems more meaningful to look at Children's Day from this perspective.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Guangzhou Correspondence <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Li</p>
<p>XX:</p>
<p>In the past half month, there have been two noteworthy events in Guangzhou: worshipping Confucius and commemorating Guan Yu and Yue Fei. Friend, you are a scholar, so you must be very concerned about worshipping Confucius. Therefore, I will now report this matter to you without fear of being tedious.</p>
<p>Friend, when you hear about worshipping Confucius, you may think that the Confucius here is more prestigious than the Confucius in other places. But in fact, he is just as unlucky. The old man has also been "[not knowing the taste of meat]" for many years. His main hall has long been converted into a military barracks. This time, he suddenly became popular, which was indeed beyond his expectations. Some people say that China is the most mysterious country in the world, and this may be true.</p>
<p>Since the announcement of the Ding Sacrifice on March 17, Confucianists have been overjoyed. They couldn't wait for the day to come so they could pay homage to the Most Sage Teacher. Especially those Cantonese who love to watch the excitement wanted to take this opportunity to visit the Confucius Temple. But in the end, they were very disappointed. On the morning of the Confucius sacrifice, the front gate of the Guangzhou Prefectural School was guarded by soldiers and police step by step. Only officials above the recommended rank or representatives of educational institutions were allowed to enter. I was fortunate to be allowed to enter as a university professor. As soon as I entered the gate, I saw a pair of large lanterns made of yellow paper, with the red characters "[Sacrifice Ceremony]" pasted on them. Entering the second gate, there was another pair of lanterns, with the characters "[Solemn Respect]" written on them. Many seasonal flower potted plants were placed on both sides of the aisle of the Dacheng Hall. A large torch was erected on the left and right sides of the Dacheng Hall. In the center of the hall was the divine seat of the Most Sage Teacher Confucius, with a large horizontal plaque of "[Teacher of All Ages]" as a background. There was a lamp in front of the deity, three large incense sticks, a pair of flower candles, and an incense burner. The sacrificial table was covered with a white cloth, on which were placed tin incense tables, several ancient sacrificial utensils, and a set of three animals [ox, sheep, pig].</p>
<p>At about four o'clock in the morning, the people presiding over the sacrifice were all present. This was the chairman of Guangdong Province, who was the main offering official. This was the director of the Education Department, and this was the director of the Finance Department. They were all secondary offering officials. A little further away, we saw the mayor of Guangzhou and the director of the Guangdong Provincial Public Security Bureau chatting there. They were also secondary offering officials. According to the rules, they were not supposed to participate in the Confucius sacrifice, but as it happened, the director of the Construction Department was concurrently held by the chairman of the province, and the director of the Civil Affairs Department was out on inspection and had not returned. Therefore, the two of them were reassigned to be the secondary offering officials. What an honorable position! Also present were the presiding officials, assistant offering officials, and other accompanying offering officials of the Chong Sheng Temple. They were squeezing around in the crowd.</p>
<p>The ritual of this Confucius sacrifice had already been decided by the Political Affairs Conference. The principle was: "[In terms of spirit, we will restore the sacred canons, while in terms of form, we will not deviate from current etiquette]." Regarding clothing, the main and secondary offering officials all wore formal attire, and the accompanying offering officials wore regular attire. Secondly, during the sacrifice, bowing was performed instead of kneeling, because that was no longer fashionable. But the most difficult problem was music and dance. The ancient tunes seemed to have not been played for a long time, and "[Yi Sheng]" could not be trained in a short period of time. The solution was to invite a local national music research society to play music to add to the atmosphere. As for the rituals such as offering inscribed tablets, offering silk, offering wine, and receiving blessed meat, they were all carried out as before, to show the meaning of restoring the past. At about five o'clock in the morning, the solemn and grand Confucius sacrifice ceremony came to an end.</p>
<p>Regarding the significance of this Confucius sacrifice and its impact, the Guangzhou Minguo Daily editorial on March 17th spoke very thoroughly. I will now excerpt a passage as the end of this correspondence:</p>
<p>"[Since the founding of the Republic of China, there have been frequent upheavals. There has been constant warfare, and there has been no time for civil administration. Moreover, with the rise of heterodox doctrines and the extremism of people's hearts, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame have disappeared. Alas, alas, the solemn and brilliant Confucius Temple, and the solemn and orderly sacrificial rites, have been abandoned for who knows how many years. Commander-in-Chief Chen deeply laments the deepening national crisis and the diminishing of people's hearts. Those evil and lewd things become more and more wanton, and the right path is declining and about to disappear completely. Therefore, he did not avoid criticism and resolutely proposed that all schools should study the classics in the midst of national confusion and fanatical bewilderment. He also reprinted the Classic of Filial Piety and wrote a preface for it himself. Moreover, he carried out the Upper Ding Spring Sacrifice today. How beautiful and glorious! To turn back the tide of the great sea and to purify the eyes and ears of the people. The elders lamented the reappearance of the Han officials, and all the families rejoiced and knew where to return. If it were not for our Commander-in-Chief Chen who aspired to the ancients and had a profound understanding, who could participate in this?]"</p>

<p>— Bai Yan</p>
<p>While tidying up my bookcase, a photo of Little Lotus from a long time ago fell out of a book. I didn't expect this photo, which had been lost for a long time, to reappear unintentionally. I held it tightly in my hand as if reuniting with an old friend, and carefully examined it: those round eyes, curved eyebrows, small cherry mouth, shallow dimples, and the round face, which was well-proportioned and lovable, all deeply evoked my past memories.</p>
<p>It has been so many years, it seemed like such a spring, when the pear blossoms were in full bloom, the east wind blew the faint fragrance of grass buds, and the initial heat made people feel a little dizzy. At that time, I leaned softly against the fatty bean tree in front of the house, holding a copy of "Dream of the Red Chamber," and reading it with fascination. When I saw:</p>
<p>"[Scattered fallen flowers on the Hundred Flower Isle, fragrant remnants on the Swallow Tower; one after another, forming balls in groups. Drifting and wandering is also like the thin fate of people, empty entanglements, and graceful romance! Even plants and trees know sorrow, and youth turns white. Sighing about this life, who will give and who will take? Married to the east wind, spring does not care, let you go, endure to be left behind. ]"</p>
<p>I couldn't help but silently chant it. I was focusing all my attention on the book, and I didn't know when Little Lotus had also come. It was when I accidentally turned my head that I discovered that she was squatting on the grass not far from me, mechanically stroking the grass with her hands, her head bowed, and immersed in meditation. "[Hey! Little Lotus:]" I called softly.</p>
<p>She didn't answer, just raised her head slightly, and then lowered it again to play with the grass.</p>
<p>So I rolled up the book and walked lightly towards her. I said, "[Little Lotus! Why aren't you paying attention to me!]" and squatted down next to her. But she suddenly turned her head away.</p>
<p>"[Little Lotus! Why aren't you paying attention to me?]" I asked angrily, and rubbed her shoulders with my hands.</p>
<p>"[Paying attention to you!]" She twisted her body and looked at me.</p>
<p>"[Then why didn't you answer when I called you?]"</p>
<p>"[I didn't hear you. ]" She lowered her head and smiled.</p>
<p>"[Okay! You're really good at pretending. I'll call you again now]." I also smiled and deliberately called out loudly:</p>
<p>"[Little Lotus! Little Lotus! ·····]"</p>
<h3 id="e222">Travel Notes of Nankou (Part 1) <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— He Jie</p>
<p>The motivation for going to Nankou that time was not "[joining the army]," and the result was not bringing back several beautiful poems, embodying courage in gentleness; but because I lived in Beijing, and that place was not far away. It would be a bit unreasonable not to go once. Besides, if I didn't go early, maybe after a year or two, when I wanted to go, I would have to apply for a passport, which would be even more troublesome. So, taking advantage of that good time, I went there once.</p>
<p>Some people say that traveling in China is asking for trouble. In the past, I didn't dare to deny this statement. After going to Nankou once, it further increased my firm belief in my heart.</p>
<p>I got on the train at Xizhimen Station. Fifteen minutes after the scheduled time, the train moved slowly. But before it went out, it suddenly stopped again. I saw railway employees in uniform blowing whistles with their mouths wide open, and armed comrades shouldering guns running back and forth.</p>
<p>It stopped for another ten minutes before it started moving again. Later I learned that the reason was that a regimental commander was ten minutes late, and the train had to wait for him respectfully.</p>
<p>As the train moved, the carriages swayed from side to side, and I felt uneasy in my heart. Seeing the old man sitting on the chair, smoking his pipe and looking relaxed, I realized that my panic was unfounded. They were used to it, and everything was safe once they were used to it, so there was no need to worry. Gradually, I also forgot about the possible dangers, because the fifteen of us, men, women, old and young, were standing there. Although we were surrounded by people, we wouldn't fall down, but standing for a long time made our legs sore, and all our minds were focused on how to get a seat.</p>
<p>I didn't get a seat, so I stood all the way to Changping.</p>
<p>Fortunately, God blessed me. After walking hundreds of miles and seeing the Ming Tombs, I arrived safely at Nankou Station in the evening. The place to stay was the Nankou Hotel. As soon as I approached the door, a rough voice shouted:</p>
<p>"[Stop!]"</p>
<p>I couldn't see anything in the dark, but I saw a flashlight light up, and a dark figure walked towards us. It turned out to be an armed comrade.</p>
<p>One person told him that we were from Beijing and had booked a room at the Nankou Hotel. Only then did he shine the flashlight on everyone's faces and allowed us to enter.</p>
<p>"[Once you go in, you are not allowed to come out. It's a big deal, do you hear?]"</p>
<p>The armed comrade said in a lecturing tone. It was not good to answer, so I could only lower my head and walk inside. When I arrived at the place to stay, there were not enough beds. After negotiation, I learned that many beds were taken away by comrades who were defending the country and protecting the people. We had to share a bed, and each person had to pay one yuan for the room.</p>
<p>I didn't care about those things. The fatigue of the day made me fall asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow. When I opened my eyes, it was already dawn.</p>
<p>"[Oooooh···! Okay! I will answer you now.丨Like calling back a soul. ]" When she said the last sentence, she frowned slightly.</p>
<p>Seeing her like this, I said coldly at the time:</p>
<p>"[You're not happy that I called you, are you?]"</p>
<p>"[Happy!]" She said a little impatiently.</p>
<p>Her strange attitude made me silent. I stared at her without moving, and felt a little unhappy in my heart. After a moment of relative silence for five minutes, she suddenly raised her head and looked at me, hesitatingly saying:</p>
<p>"[I'll tell you!]" But she suddenly stopped again.</p>
<p>Finally, she still lowered her head and said as if to herself; "[No, I'd better not say it. ]"</p>
<p>But her hesitant behavior inevitably aroused my suspicion, and I could no longer bear it, so I shook her body with my hands. As if forcing and begging, I said,</p>
<p>"[No, Little Lotus! You must tell me. ]"</p>
<p>"[I can tell you, but you can't tell anyone else. ]" She said slowly.</p>
<p>I nodded silently. Then she moved her body closer to me. She puckered her mouth shyly and said:</p>
<p>"[Today, Zhang's mother-in-law came to my house to propose marriage for me. ]"</p>
<p>(Her voice was a little vague.)</p>
<p>"[Did your mother agree?]" I asked anxiously.</p>
<p>"[I don't know. ]" She answered vaguely, biting her upper lip. And lowered her head to play with the corner of her clothes.</p>
<p>After hearing this, I was at a loss, and my heart seemed to be suddenly covered with a layer of shadows. With the melancholy eyes of a patient, I stared at the hand playing with the corner of her clothes, motionless.</p>
<p>After a while, I hesitated and said with a slight trembling voice:</p>
<p>"[Didn't my mother tell your mother that she wanted you to be her daughter-in-law?]"</p>
<p>"[That was just a joke. ]" She quickly continued,</p>
<p>"[My mother said, how can people like us be related to your family!···Even if we could, we wouldn't have money to pay for the dowry! ]"</p>
<p>So I became silent again. A stream-like silence occupied our surroundings, and the air seemed to be dead. Before long, she was called away by her mother.</p>
<p>Ah! It has been so many years 丨 Now looking at her beautiful figure, the old tenderness unknowingly returned to my mind again. I slumped in the rattan chair, lowered my eyes and reminisced···</p>
<p>The books were not tidied up in the end, but they aroused a lot of sorrow.</p>

<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>What does it mean to put these two days together? Is it to thank the friendly nation for its kindness? Otherwise, is it to fawn on the friendly nation in a lowly manner? It has been two years, yes, the second anniversary is unforgettable and cannot be easily buried. For two years, this Guandong Road has fallen into a deeper abyss than before. It seems that the bright days have moved far away. A country that governs with the principle of royal way has been plagued by mutinies and popular grievances in various places it has ruled for a year. Whether in the city or in the countryside, people's livelihoods are hundreds or thousands of times more difficult than before. It is said to thank the friendly nation for its kindness, but that is actually enough. Aren't those people from the friendly nation using the military's force to forcibly occupy other people's land everywhere and oppress good people? They can also do a lot of unspeakable bad things that violate national laws. However, they are, after all, people from a friendly nation, and national laws cannot be applied to them. This gives them a special privilege out of thin air. Enough, I don't want to think about it, I don't want to look at it. The more I think about those things, the angrier I get, and the more I look at the words in front of me, the more anxious I get. 丨丨When will this place be able to regain its freedom?</p>
<p>Continuing to walk, at the entrance of Mongolian Banner Alley, I was blocked by a crowd of people in front.</p>
<p>"[What's going on?]"</p>
<p>While asking myself, I walked to the crowd. The place where people's eyes were focused was a policeman and a bald female madman. After standing for a while, I learned the cause of the incident from people's conversation. It was because the policeman wanted the small shop to hang the national flag. The man in the shop went to the market to buy vegetables, and it happened that this madwoman, the female owner, came to receive the policeman's order. I don't know what happened, but it was nothing more than a disagreement in words, and the two sides clashed. Several streaks of blood flowed from the madwoman's face, naturally from the policeman's ruthless hand. But she was also a true heroine, constantly cursing her opponent:</p>
<p>"[Police dog! You're good! You hit people! I'll settle the score with you! ]"</p>
<p>The policeman stood with his arms crossed, his head tilted, his mouth cracked like a ladle, and occasionally "[hmph]"ed, as if he was showing his noble status to a group of onlookers. It seemed to also contain the spirit of "[you can't do anything to me]".</p>
<p>The police of the new country, since their monthly salary was increased by one national currency note, everyone has been unusually dedicated to their duties and selling their strength, especially to the suffering people. They will show rare majesty. These people seem to have forgotten that they were originally just a subjugated slave and a running dog of imperialism.</p>
<p>I didn't want to waste any more time, so I squeezed through the crowd. However, I can speculate that the result of the incident is that the madwoman will probably still suffer. Of course, it is the madwoman!</p>
<p>I saw the school gate. Two big flags, the Japanese flag and the "[Manchukuo]" flag, were hung crosswise at the entrance. Therefore, the horizontal plaque with "[Jilin Provincial Women's Middle School]" written on it was covered by the flag body, only revealing the three characters in the middle. The preparatory bell rang, urging me to speed up my pace. When I hurriedly walked into the school, the students were all noisily lining up, saying that they were going to the sports field to hold a meeting. I quietly slipped into the crowd. The director of discipline only noticed the chaotic crowd, so he didn't notice my lateness. Looking at the students lining up, few people showed a smiling face. Saying that they were going to attend a celebration meeting, no one really believed it. In their hearts, it seemed that there was a troublesome worry.</p>

<h3 id="e225">Financial Spring Break: US Banks Soar, Gold Market Stumbles <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>Falling Four Dollars and Forty Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, during the spring holiday, as many US banks surged, the gold market trended downward. However, trading was lackluster, with minimal fluctuations. The central bank's intervention in the spot market stabilized the situation. Initially, due to slight increases in British banks during the closing period and gains in US banks, the forward silver prices at the Five Metals Exchange rose by 0.92 to 1.08%, respectively. London gold fell by 9.5 pence. Exchange rates also increased. US wheat and cotton prices rose as well. Wool prices opened lower at 53-54 yuan but saw robust and stable buying on dips. Although prices dipped after HSBC posted higher rates, market sentiment remained calm, and trading was mostly stable. Subsequently, the foreign exchange market slightly tightened, and central bank intervention boosted prices. Despite news reports that the US Treasury Secretary was considering three options for maturing public debt – exchanging new bonds for old, redeeming with silver, and issuing low-interest paper money – there was no significant impact. Later, the central bank continued to offer spot gold, stabilizing the market. The foreign exchange market then tightened, slightly boosting market sentiment. The central bank offered approximately 630 bars of spot gold, handled by major firms such as Da De Cheng, Tai Kang, Run Da Feng, Heng Ying, and Feng Heng. The morning price was 956.5 yuan, and the afternoon price was 958.5 yuan. Swaps were quoted by Ying Feng Heng at a discount of one to 1.3 yuan, valuing pure gold at 968 yuan. The day's market conditions are detailed below.</p>
<p>The morning opened at 955.1 yuan, a decrease of 6.9 yuan from the closing price before the holiday. Spot goods opened at 5 yuan. The foreign exchange market opened with recent selling prices of British exchange at 1 shilling 4.25 pence and US exchange at 34.8125 yuan. Yuan Heng, Heng Yu, Fu Xing, Yong Yong Feng, Da Fa, and Yong Sheng Da sold off, retreating to 4.1 yuan. Macgregor bought August US dollars at 35.3125 yuan. Sheng Da, Da De Cheng, Da Lian Bang, Fu Yu, Zhi Feng, Yong Chang Sheng, Yong Heng Yu all bought in, pushing the price up to 6 yuan. HSBC's rate announcement revealed British exchange up 125 points and US exchange up 375 points. Many smaller players and Qian Chang Xiang sold off, causing the price to drop again to 4.8 yuan. The central bank intervened by offering spot gold. Although Da Lian Bang, Heng Yu, and Yuan Heng bought up to 5.8 yuan, Qian Chang Xiang supplied gold, causing prices to fall. The market hovered for a long time, and the foreign exchange market was particularly calm. Shanghai bought June US dollars at 125 points, stabilizing the market. Finally, Zhi Feng, Yong Yu, Qing Yong, Fu Yu, Qian Chang Xiang, Da Xing Yong, Da De Cheng, Yi Feng Yong, and others jointly bought in, gradually pushing the price up to 7 yuan. The domestic market also tightened. After struggling, the morning closed at 956.7 yuan, with spot goods quoted at 6.6 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon opened at 956.4 yuan, with spot goods opening at 6.7 yuan. Zheng Jin bought July US dollars at 125 points. Yong De Heng Xing and Ying Feng Heng all bought in, and the central bank continued to offer spot goods, pushing the price up to 7.3 yuan. Macgregor also bought August US dollars at 3125 points. Then, Shanghai offered July US dollars at 125 points. Qian Chang Xiang, Cheng Kang, Yong Da Xing, Yong Heng Tai, and others sold off slightly, causing the price to drop to 6.9 yuan. Macgregor bid for August US dollars at 8125 points. Heng Xing and Tian Feng limited their positions and remained stable. Later, as Chinese merchants continued to bid for near-term US dollars, the foreign exchange market seemed to tighten. Sheng Da, Heng Yu, Yuan Chun, and others successively bought, pushing the price up to 7.7 yuan. Spot goods were supplied, and the closing price was 957.6 yuan, with spot goods quoted at the same price. The market situation was particularly calm after closing. The highest price of the day was 957.7 yuan, and the lowest price was 954.1 yuan, a difference of 3.6 yuan. As a result, the price fell by 4.4 yuan compared to the pre-holiday closing.</p>
<p>The settlement price, due to HSBC's US dollar rate increase of 375 points, was 34.5 yuan, equivalent to a gold price of slightly below 1003 yuan. Based on the closing price, it was approximately 45 yuan, more than 6 yuan lower than the pre-holiday level. The registration price for this month was 958 yuan, and for May was 957 yuan. The morning supplementary payment was 958 yuan, and the afternoon supplementary payment was 959 yuan. The pure gold price was 968 yuan. Dealers in the market were inclined to sell. The transaction price for Tianjin goods was 13 yuan and 13.25 yuan higher. Over 3,000 taels were sold by Tianjin dealers to colleagues. In addition, over 1,000 taels of eastern goods were bought by colleagues at 12 yuan and 12.15 yuan higher. On the public bond market, 385 bonds for this month were released by Qian Chang Xiang, 70 by Tong Feng Heng, and 7 by Yong Feng. Those who bought in included Shen Bao with 105 bonds (later transferred to spot goods and released again in the afternoon), Heng Yu and Heng Xing with 84 bonds each, Hui Yuan with 70 bonds, Zhi Feng Yong with 42 bonds, Ying Feng Heng with 28 bonds, Yi Cheng with 21 bonds, and Yuan Heng, Yuan Mao Yong with 14 bonds each.

Heng Yu transferred 273 bonds to Fu Chang, at 958 yuan. Swaps were offered by Ying Feng Heng to Heng Xing for 133 bonds, and by Tong Feng Heng to Heng Xing for 49 bonds at a discount of 1.3 yuan. Ying Feng Heng offered swaps to Yi Cheng for 84 bonds at a discount of 1 yuan, and to Hui Yuan for 294 bonds and Hui Xiang for 35 bonds, all at a discount of 1.2 yuan, and opened spot goods. As of today, there were 672 bonds remaining for April, with seven long positions and six short positions.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was mediocre. Wan Xing, Shun Li, Yi Feng Yong, Heng Yu, Heng Tai, Da De Cheng, Yong Feng Yu, Qing Yong, Heng Chang Yong, Zhi Feng Yong, Fu Yu, Heng Xing, and others were primarily on the buying side. Si Da, Da Fa Yong, Tian Feng, Yuan Chun, Ying Feng Heng, Hong Li, Tong Chun, Yuan Mao, Yuan Mao Yong, Bing Xing, Cheng Kang Yong, and others were primarily on the selling side. Chang Sheng Yong and Da Xing Yong Qian Chang Xiang Hui Xiang were advanced and then exited. Fu Xing Yong, Yi Da Yong, Sheng Da, and Ying Feng Heng exited first and then entered. Da Lian Bang and Wan Xing together traded around 1,400 contracts, netting in over 500 contracts. Shun Li traded over 800 contracts, netting in over 500 contracts. Guang Bang Sheng Da traded approximately 500 contracts each way. Heng Xing's transactions were minimal, with more netting in.

<h3 id="e229">Securities Too High to Go Higher, Bond Market Slightly Declines <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>Securities Exchange Closed for Spring Break from the 5th to the 7th</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange market showed signs of change. Market prices seemed too high to go higher and showed a slight decline, as expected. Large investors were active, observing the situation, and appeared to be spreading out their positions. Small investors seemed crowded with long positions. Additionally, due to the exchange's announcement that it would be closed for the Spring Festival holiday from the 5th to the 7th of this month, with the 8th being Sunday, and reopening only on the 9th, the four-day closure period caused some to take profits. This was due to the overvaluation of market prices. The trend may continue to be small. The rise of the "96" bond was uniquely characterized by a rapid rise and fall, reminiscent of the previous contradiction. It reached a record high of 12.8 yuan. News reports that were favorable to the "96" bond caused simple-minded investors to engage in unconscious buying. Northern investors seemed particularly strong, appearing to have a deep understanding of the bond. They seemed infatuated without proper research. In reality, someone was manipulating the bond. It is unknown when the bond will be properly managed. The bulls were fabricating news to entice buyers. Clear-eyed investors could see through the deception. As a result, all first-issue bond markets saw a small decline of 2-3 points. The "96" bond, however, rose step by step, reaching 12.8 yuan again, before declining from the high to 12.4 yuan, but still rising by half a yuan to eight points. The rise and fall were extremely fast and dangerous. The secondary issue, bond No. 38, continued to be sold off, declining another 3-4 points. The "96" bond then rose another eight points. After the afternoon opening, bonds No. 35 and 50 were also sold off. Bond No. 31 alone saw buying interest. Disarmament bonds fell by more than half a yuan, and the rest fell by small amounts of 2-3 points. Unified Salt Tax bonds rose, with small investors still buying in. Prices gradually turned from firm to rising, increasing by 5 points to 3-4 points. Before closing, the bonds listed were all flat. Twenty-year bonds gradually trended higher. There was strong buying of this month's Salt Tax bonds from the 15th issue, and buying interest in bond No. 1 was also not weak, increasing by 3-4 points. However, the official "96" bonds were very weak. The 1922 Customs bonds fell by a small amount of 6.5 points. The overall trend was not promising, and there may still be some recovery. As a result, market prices fell by 2-3 points to about 7 points. The "96" bond also fell by 3.5 points to 6.5 points. This can be described as a pointless disturbance. The total transaction volume was 19,762,000 yuan, including 2,000 yuan in cash. Futures accounted for 19,760,000 yuan. The results of the highest, lowest, rise, and fall are listed in the comparison table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<h3 id="e230">New York Mining Stocks Reach New Highs <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm, citing the Wall Street Journal, reports that the stock market was generally slightly higher yesterday. Market sentiment was more optimistic than before, as Wall Street interpreted commercial prospects positively. Mining stocks saw mixed fluctuations, with gold mining stocks reaching new highs. Utility stocks were weak due to the New York State government's investigation. Railroad stocks were firm. The small exchange saw mixed results due to weakness in utility stocks. Bonds were slightly higher, with corporate bonds showing particular strength. Additionally, the New York agent of the firm reports that securities continue to be strong, with the strongest demand in coal oil, department stores, and gold mining stocks. The wheat market is crowded, and trading may continue to be restricted, hindering business. Private estimates for winter wheat are 500,000,000 bushels, indicating a gradual decrease in supply. Farmers are not storing much. Bulls continue to sell off cotton. Weak market demand and the Secretary of Agriculture Wallace's lukewarm comments on the Bankhead Act caused market sentiment to weaken. At the same time, although the US is reducing planting, there is concern that foreign cotton production will expand. The status of the Bankhead Act has not changed. The silver lobby is expected to be active in promoting silver legislation next week. Cotton planting is largely complete, and the spot market is calm. The total daily transaction volume was 1,370,000 shares. The Dow Jones indices are listed below.</p>

<p>Yarn Exchange Closed on the 4th and 5th for Holiday</p>
<p>The yarn market fell in the morning but recovered in the afternoon. The Sichuan and Guangdong factions saw relatively active buying, while other factions remained sluggish. Market sentiment was difficult to stimulate. General speculators viewed the environment unfavorably and selling pressure increased. However, in the afternoon, due to the Qingming Festival market closure starting tomorrow for two days, those who profited took the opportunity to close positions, causing the market to recover by several points.</p>
<p>Marked Yarn Prices Down Another Seven to Eight Points</p>
<p>Marked yarn opened in the morning, and due to falling US cotton prices and strong selling pressure, prices for each month fell by 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 points to 1.1 points. In the afternoon, short covering caused prices for each month to increase by 0.4 and 0.6 points. The total transaction volume for the day was 35,800 bales. Chang Feng sold 2,200 bales, Tai Chang 1,150 bales, Geng Ji 3,350 bales, Chun Ji 1,100 bales, Tong Ji 1,050 bales, and Tong Xing 1,000 bales. Da Chang Cheng bought 2,900 bales, Ming De 1,400 bales, Tong Fu 950 bales, Chun Ji 750 bales, Shen Ji 950 bales, Yuan Tai 900 bales, Zhen Da 650 bales, and Chang Feng 600 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>

<p>Total 191,000</p>
<p>Spot Yarn from Sichuan and Guangdong Selling Well</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales remained smooth. The total number of bales bought by all factions for the day was 1,390 bales. Prices fell by 0.5 yuan to 1 yuan. The purchase volume for each faction is as follows:</p>
<p>Northern 25 Domestic 235 Guangdong 540 Colleagues 30</p>
<p>Swatow 33 Ningbo 17 Sichuan 500 Zhenjiang 10</p>
<p>The cotton market's declining trend intensified. Due to falling US cotton prices and the collapse of the yarn market, the ratio between cotton and yarn prices indicated that cotton prices were too high. As a result, factories stopped purchasing high-priced raw materials. However, some people were optimistic due to Shanghai's low inventory. According to industry insiders, there is a large amount of stockpiled goods in various producing areas that have not yet been shipped. Therefore, the cotton market may be difficult to stabilize.</p>
<p>April Cotton Down to 41 Yuan</p>
<p>Marked cotton opened in the morning, and with US cotton prices falling and a lack of major buyers, bulls closed positions. Prices for each month fell by 0.3 and 0.4 points. In the afternoon, those who profited covered their positions, causing prices for each month to increase by 0.05 to 0.1 points. The total transaction volume for the day was 100,520 piculs. Ren Feng sold 8,400 piculs, Yi Feng 4,700 piculs, Da Ji 3,000 piculs, Geng Feng 2,000 piculs, Yong Da 1,900 piculs, Tong He 1,600 piculs, Xin Heng 3,100 piculs, Chun Ji 5,400 piculs, Da 1,700 piculs, Da 1,900 piculs, and De Ji 1,500 piculs.

<p>High Raw Cotton Prices Cause Factories to Stop Buying</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption was extremely limited. All factories showed no intention of buying. The sources were 562 bales of Yao cotton and 200 bales of Tong cotton. The spot cotton prices are as follows:</p>

<p>Yesterday's US cotton market rose initially due to large-scale buying, but fell later due to Southern selling and bull profit-taking. As a result, spot prices fell by 5 points, and futures prices fell by 6-8 points. The Liverpool and Mumbai markets were closed for the holiday.

<p>In March, approximately 20,000 bales of Japanese yarn were sold in Shanghai and approximately 13,000 bales were re-exported, totaling 33,000 bales. The production volume in mid-March was approximately 25,000 bales, with 8,000 bales more sold than produced, using up the previous month's inventory. However, the inventory at the end of February was 57,000 bales, so the inventory at the end of March was approximately 49,800 bales. Japanese factory's cotton cloth sales were relatively strong due to spring sales promotions. The factory's transaction volume in the most recent week was approximately 7-8,000 bales. However, market prices were stable and showed no sign of improvement.</p>
<h3 id="e234">Rice Prices: Mid-Range and Lower Grades See Slight Price Adjustment <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) The sources from various factions, with the fragrance harvest being relatively sparse, arrived only near the 30th (over 5,000 stones), with thick and thin japonica rice each accounting for half. In terms of sales, thick japonica rice sales in both urban and rural areas remained flat, with the situation being weak. Fortunately, the arrival of goods was limited, and sellers were all trying to create a positive market, which allowed the market to stand its ground. However, due to sluggish sales, the middle and lower grades of Chang Gang Su and Tong Gang Nanggang goods all softened by 0.05 yuan, except for the higher grades. The supply and demand of Du Yang Jian rice were mutually matched, and the market price remained unchanged. The source of the Yin Bian Yuan Lai goods was rare, and sales were also sluggish. The weak market tone was difficult to turn around, but it managed to stabilize slightly. The sales of late rice remain weak, but fortunately, customer purchases had not declined, and the market tone remained similar. The northern and southern gangs both moved from the beginning of the market to the close, jointly purchasing 2,200-2,300 packages of Qing Jiao Song Si and Xi Lian goods. The market price held steady on both sides, with little change, only with middle and lower grades showing a slight softening.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the goods from various areas downstream of the river arrived on the 27th and 28th. Due to the unresolved dispute over measurement and alcohol fees, the market sales were limited, and transactions were scarce. White japonica rice stood firm, with a near-corner price increase for sharp, white rice. Yang Du Customer rice was also tight by several points. Early thin rice and Yin Yuan rice were unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e235">The Kehsing Rice from Fujian is Selling Well <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>丨New Shipments from Jiangxi and Hunan Arrive丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market condition for Kehsing rice showed that the Fujianese merchants were again eager to purchase. Taking advantage of the Spring Festival holiday period, when other merchants were pausing, they actively bought up supplies, seeking lower prices and better selection. Yesterday, Fuzhou and Quanzhou merchants together traded a total of 4,529 packages of Xiang, Gan, Shasha, Zao, and Jingchang rice. Quanzhou bought less than a thousand packages; the rest was imported by Fuzhou. Zhejiang merchants were still observing the market. Yesterday, Wenzhou merchants responded to the market and purchased 200 packages of Wuhu machine-milled rice. Local merchants, however, were not as eager to buy Kehsing rice because of the recent arrival of river rice and the availability of "small twisted" rice sold by foreign merchants. Yesterday, they only bought 200 packages of Hunan Jing rice and 300 packages of "small twisted" rice; there was no demand for other types. The market was similar to the previous day. Sellers intended to raise prices, but buyers were cautious. Two batches of newly arrived Jiangxi machine-milled rice were goods that had been subject to increased shipping costs by shallow-water ferry companies last winter but had not yet been loaded; they were not newly produced. Therefore, their cost was lower, and sellers were eager to sell them after arriving in Shanghai. As a result, the price of the 800 packages of machine-milled late rice that opened yesterday fell slightly by five points. The prices of all other types of rice remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e236">Sugar Market: Taikoo Sugar Rises by Five Points <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a trend towards stability as customs gold improved in the afternoon. The public association's base price for No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar remained at $19.80, and high-grade ordinary Zhuang sugar was at $19.85. No. 8 and 9 Dutch red sugar remained firm. Taikoo Sugar B was at $20.25, with some transactions, an increase of five points from the previous day. Chen Kee's No. 1 fine white sugar was at $18.40, a decrease of five points from the previous day. Numbers 2, 3, and 4 were unchanged. Chaozhou merchants offered a batch of "Jiao Yang" sugar, totaling 200 packages, at $14.85. Previously, the offering price had been above $15.00; it has now fallen by two or three jiao. Yesterday, more Hainan red sugar arrived on Guangdong ships, with high-grade sugar quoted at $13.45, but no transactions occurred. There are currently about 20,000 packages of Chaozhou green sugar in stock, which is not considered a large amount. Because land prices have risen, merchants are unwilling to weaken their position. Therefore, even though sales are slow, asking prices have not been lowered.</p>
<h3 id="e237">Linen and Waterproof Cloth Sell Well <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>Linen and waterproof cloth have been very popular recently, leading to a gradual increase in imports. For summer Western-style clothing, most people are abandoning baratheas and using this material instead. Both local and out-of-town merchants are seeking samples and placing orders, making it more popular than other woolens, linen yarns, and wool textiles. Yesterday, a merchant offered over 400 yards of three-foot linen waterproof cloth at $3.25. Fair Company offered over 500 yards of yellow linen waterproof cloth at $1.05. Tianxiang goods were offered at over 200 yards at $1.125.</p>
<h3 id="e238">Silk and Tea: Shanghai Silk Sales Remain Stagnant <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>(Shanghai Silk Factories to Close) Only a dozen or so silk factories in Shanghai have勉力 reopened after the New Year. Overseas silk prices continue to plummet, and silk is being ignored. The factories that have reopened are likely to close. Currently, only Bao Tai, Yi Er, Yong Heng, Fu Lun, Heng Feng Tai, and a few other factories in the concession and Chinese areas are勉强operating. Most of them are reeling silk抵 for financial institutions. Production will stop as soon as the reeling is finished. The future of silk factories is bleak.</p>
<p>(Factories Have High Costs and Little Profit, Making Sales Difficult) Due to inflation issues in the New York market, raw silk prices have risen, but European and American companies in Shanghai are still trying to suppress prices and purchase cheaply. Chinese silk merchants are suffering significant losses, making negotiations difficult. Domestic silk factories are offering Guangdong silk at around $400, but they have no interest in factory-dried silk. Silk sales activity will take time.</p>
<h3 id="e239">Gongxi Green Tea Sales Slightly Improve <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>The tea market for foreign firms in Shanghai has been depressed for a long time. Electric telegrams were sent out by various foreign firms regarding pearl tea last week, but nothing was learned. However, yesterday, because of demand from Mumbai, Beitou Zhuang, Yulong, and Shengsheng firms slightly improved sales of Gongxi tea. Over 230 chests were traded in the city. The price of goods from new sources was set at $48, while the price of local goods was set at $22, which is an extremely low market. Other goods, such as Xiumei tea, remained unwanted.</p>
<h3 id="e240">Northern Goods and Aged Grain Rice Branches See Prices Decline <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>Due to the poor harvest last year, the glutinous rice branches that arrived were all aged goods. This spring, merchants offering carefully selected high-quality goods once sold them for $130-140. Now, as sales have slowed, the branch prices have eased. It was heard yesterday that a batch was offered for only $82 because it had slight worm damage, a decrease of over $10 from before. Merchants have also lowered prices, and carefully selected good-quality goods were sold yesterday for $100.</p>

<h3 id="e245">[Return to Nature] <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Qiong Sheng</p>
<p>In this declining society, people's pursuit of pleasure and indulgence seems to have reached its peak. The prevalence of dance halls and amusement parks is a given. But even in cinema, which bears the social responsibility of education, the appeal of alluring sensuality is universally used as a box-office draw. In the past, there was "The Healthy Female," which promoted nudism and reportedly attracted tens of thousands of viewers. Following this trend, two films, "Return to Nature" and "Physical Exercise," have recently been released. The advertisements are full of phrases like "Nude Exercise Photo Special," "Thorough Study of Human Beauty," "A First-Ever Attempt," almost vividly hyping the films. Phrases like "The spring sunshine is bright, don't waste your youth" and "Seize the moment, what could be more enjoyable?" further exert every effort to entice viewers.</p>
<p>Using the promotion of physical exercise or nudism as a shield to satisfy a certain kind of desire in a segment of the population is like adopting the attitude of "I don't care about what happens after I'm gone" from those in a declining social stratum. It's like a person who, nearing the end of their life, gives in to despair before passing away peacefully. Currently, film merchants attracting viewers with scenes of actresses emerging from baths, showing thighs and nipples, is precisely pandering to their tastes and seeking to reflect the prevailing environment. Naturally, this phenomenon causes many moralists to shake their heads and sigh. However, many people flock to it because its emergence and prevalence have deep social and economic roots, and it is not merely due to "the deterioration of social customs and the decline of morality."</p>
<p>Return to nature! Many advocates of physical exercise or nudism are now shouting this slogan, calling for the removal of clothing restraints. We also see many modern women, enamored with nude fitness, echoing this call. Under this bizarre phenomenon of men singing and women harmonizing, is the so-called nude fitness movement the root of all licentious and lascivious events?</p>
<p>If physical exercise does not aim to please men or center on male promotion, it would not be a bad thing to strengthen women's bodies in China, where the aesthetic ideal is the delicate and melancholic Lin Daiyu. This could be the starting point for increasing women's social endeavors. Its content is not limited to the health and beauty of women's bodies, but also includes the nature of women striving for social status and breaking free from family burdens. In breaking down the social system where men control economic power, restoring the gender relations of primitive society can indeed be said to have the meaning of "returning to nature." As for the so-called nude movement, it is by no means the public exhibition of reproductive organs as the promoters and general public in this morbid society imagine. On the one hand, it is to remove the restraints of being adorned with jewels and fettered limbs, and has the purpose of opposing the aesthetic view of women as playthings and the effeminate. On the other hand, it is purely based on physiological hygiene and eugenics to improve women's physical fitness. Exposure to sunlight, sea bathing, and various other indoor and outdoor exercises are of great benefit to removing clothing restraints.</p>
<p>This, of course, is from a scientific point of view. However, in today's society, where women's bodies are commodities on the one hand and "rare commodities" on the other, physical exercise and nude movements have become weapons for some people to "feast on beauty" or achieve certain ambitions. This cannot be explained solely by sexual impulse, but is due to the current environment where "money can make the devil carry a sedan chair," women's economic dependence, and their social subjugation.</p>
<p>This "Return to Nature" movement, it is said, originated in Germany. There are nude beaches in Paris, and it is just beginning to flourish in America. In China, the mere mention of this is as mysterious and rejected as co-education was in the past. Originally, the reproductive organs are not that mysterious. What is mysterious is the ulterior motive of many of those who advocate nudism. It was previously reported that these people had come to Hong Kong and Shanghai to promote it. The torrent of the times is truly topsy-turvy. A few years ago, rumors spread that the Soviet Union was implementing a nude movement and that there was a nude parade in a certain port, which aroused criticism from moralists in various countries, including ours. People suspected ghosts and opposed it as if it were a flood or a beast, but now the movie theaters are heavily promoting it and even imitating it themselves.</p>
<p>But what's so strange about that? There are plenty of people who spout morality and righteousness but secretly act like Ximen Qing from "The Golden Lotus."</p>
<h3 id="e246">Sad Thoughts on Children's Day <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Xin</p>
<p>Women and children have always been considered insignificant in China. In the past two years, it seems that there has been a dramatic change. Women have Women's Day, and children have Children's Day. This correction of a mistaken perception is certainly a welcome thing.</p>
<p>This year's Children's Day has arrived again, and social leaders are enthusiastically leading the children in celebrating this joyous occasion. My childhood is already gone. Not only will I not be like today's children, who get a holiday, candy, performances to watch, and a chance to show off their new clothes on this day, but my own era only holds unfortunate and tragic memories. Moreover, even in this era of enthusiastic children's movements, I still harbor unfortunate and tragic shadows for the children of our China! I am not saying this to spoil the fun. It is just that the children in today's society are being taught to be too outrageous. I will first write down some facts to present to our most respected children's movement leaders.</p>
<p>Every day when I return from my office, at the entrance of the alley where I live (in fact, not just the entrance of the alley where I live?), there are always a dozen children, shouting, running, and screaming as they fight. These children are all returning from school after classes. Each of them holds a bamboo sword or a wooden stick in their hand. A more active child holds a metal "sword." Some wear paper crowns and fake beards, and their waists are tightly tied with a belt, just like on the "old opera" stage, except that there are no drums. But while they are pretending to fight, they are making the sounds of drums and gongs in their mouths. It is truly full of murderous intent and very imposing. The child holding the "sword" must be in the upper hand, and the others all pretend to be defeated and kneel on the ground to surrender. Only then does this fierce battle temporarily stop. However, they are reluctant to disperse. They lean against the wall or sit on the cement floor. Some are painting "little five-wheeled vehicles" and "little turtles" on the wall. Some take out square comic books from their pockets to read, "[A flash of white light, and the head disappears!]" "[Riding the clouds and mist, fighting magic weapons in the sky; with a leap, they come and go without a trace]" They are reciting in their little mouths, waving their hands and feet as they jump, as if they are longing to release swords, ride clouds, and fight treasures. The sight of them is so strange that it makes people laugh until they can't straighten their backs.</p>
<p>Every day, I walk a distance to wait for the tram, and there are always several skinny children with sallow faces following behind me, stretching out their little hands and shouting "Get rich, sir!" to passersby, asking for copper coins. When passersby intentionally or unintentionally throw them a coin, they happily pick it up and go to play "hopscotch." Some naughty boys take the coin to the cigarette paper store to buy cigarettes to smoke. Once, I was chatting at the home of a very famous "scholar" in the country. The "scholar's" twelve-year-old eldest son suddenly threw a tantrum and pestered the "scholar's" wife relentlessly, for some reason. The wife indulged her son, calling him her precious darling, and promised to buy him a newly arrived foreign doll with yellow hair and blue eyes to play with. The son still didn't comply and cried, making a fuss, pulling on the "scholar's" wife and hitting her. Later, the "scholar" got annoyed, grabbed the son and slapped his little bottom twice, and shouted loudly at the chauffeur: "A'Er, go call the red-headed A'San and sell him to the foreigners to have his eyes gouged out!" As a result, the son was probably really afraid that the foreigners would gouge out his little eyes, so he was so scared that he held his breath and hid in his mother's arms. The "scholar" then made a silent, ghostly, victorious smile.</p>
<p>These are probably not fabricated jokes, but absolutely true and heartbreaking things! However, there are many more: When watching sensual leg-dancing, they know to sit in the front row; when watching "[Return to Nature]," they will ask, "Why don't they turn around?" They can also help their mothers play mahjong with ten-yuan stakes, buy winning running dog tickets for their mothers, and listen to music and learn social dancing from their fathers. They will also tell their mothers that they want a certain good-looking girl to be their wife... and so on.</p>
<p>These heartbreaking things should harbor great seriousness for the present and future of China! On this Children's Day, when everyone is shouting "Save the children," how should we start to save this large group of young lives? Giving them a day off, holding a meeting, letting them have candy to eat, having performances to watch, and giving them the opportunity to show off their new clothes... surely it won't be that simple to save them, right? If that's the case, isn't that close to a ridiculous deception? It deceives the leaders themselves, deceives the large group of pitiful children, and only leaves them with a deeply ingrained, eternally indelible, unfortunate, and tragic memory when they grow up!</p>
<p>In a film titled "Life Road" that proclaims "Save the children," it also uses ironclad facts to prove that our methods of saving children are terribly wrong!</p>
<h3 id="e247">Postscript to Four Plays Including "Lifebuoy" <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Spring has arrived, the best season for theater. In the past month, performances have been coming one after another, quite a few indeed. As a theater enthusiast, I can't help but inquire about news related to plays. I heard that the Paradise Theater was staging plays, but I was too busy to go. Of course, I considered this a regret. However, people are like this: having experienced one regret, they must be careful the next time. So, after seeing the advertisement for the "Spring Festival Drama Performance Hosted by the Chinese Women's Cultural Society" on the second morning, I immediately decided that I must go and appreciate it that evening.</p>
<p>If someone asks, "Why are they putting on plays?" then I think it has already been clearly stated in the "Opening Remarks." Moreover, after you have seen the situation at the time, you will naturally understand the respectability of their enthusiasm. If you haven't seen it, then what's the point of saying anything?</p>
<p>I learned from various sources that this was another performance that had not been well prepared. This is the most common shortcoming of the theater movement in China and also the problem that needs to be solved urgently. I have said many times that I have some [blank space] to save it. However, there is no need to discuss it in detail here.</p>
<p>Given the above actual situation, there is no need to be too demanding of everything in this performance. Therefore, I would only like to offer some unimportant opinions below.</p>
<p>There were a total of four one-act plays, including "Lifebuoy," "Wallet," "Father Returns," and "Traitor." Comparatively speaking, "Lifebuoy" should be the best one. In this play, the playwright tells us that at present, the unemployment problem has become the most common and cruel phenomenon. Of course, their best option is to struggle to live on, but there are also a few passive ones who can only end it by jumping into the Huangpu River. However, cruel reality even deprives people of the freedom to die, because this is causing trouble for the police. So, the unemployed worker, who is already mentally disturbed, bravely breaks the glass and takes out the lifebuoy, because he thinks it is enough to save his life. Who knew that this was also causing trouble for the police? Breaking the glass is a violation of the criminal law. Okay, that's how it is. They don't want you to live, but they don't want you to die either; what else is there to say? When the unemployed worker is about to be taken to prison, another group suddenly roars and makes the police feel like they have nowhere to go. This is using comedic techniques to write tragedy, but it is also very easy to become a tragedy and lose the comedic elements. Although the awkwardness of the mentally disturbed unemployed worker is not without its laughable actions. As for the enlightened policeman, he feels unfamiliar, at least there is not enough character depiction.</p>
<p>However, this play is said to have had its script rewritten three minutes before going on stage, so I feel very satisfied. The first attempt is not necessarily a complete success. Several of the main characters, such as the unemployed worker or the enlightened policeman, were played very vividly, especially Wang Yingjun, who had great success in "Rising Moon" and has great performing talent.</p>
<p>Indeed, this play was performed well. In particular, it meets the needs of society; when the enlightened policeman told the unemployed worker to struggle to live on, the audience applauded in unison, showing that it deeply moved the audience. [Blank space].</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>Next, we should mention "Wallet." Regarding this, I have a great feeling: I think this kind of foreign play must be completely adapted. Originally, this is a very rich script, but because the [blank space] and our living habits are not very similar, it is quite difficult to please. No, in a foreign country, in conditions where the audience's standards are very high, it may not be possible to obtain a very great effect, but in China, it is bound to be discounted. The problem lies in the repetitive and verbose dialogue. We must make it clear and understandable. In addition, the performance is not very good, so it is not understood by the audience. Among them, Sha Jun is the best, Vik Jun is the second best, and Hong Dou Jun is the next best. However, if the direction is good, perhaps it can be even better.</p>
<p>"Father Returns" is very familiar to us. Among Kikuchi Kan's plays, this is the only one that can be staged and is full of emotion. It may not be very suitable at present, but based on past experience, it satisfies the tastes of Chinese people. Likewise, this time, although the performance was not very good, several ladies beside me were constantly shedding tears. However, using such an ethical play to trick the audience's tears at present is not really appropriate, is it?</p>
<p>In this play, we do not see a more appropriate direction. In fact, it is said that they only went over the lines once before going on stage. Fortunately, the actors are all experienced, so they can still deal with it.</p>
<p>Finally, regarding "Traitor," I don't want to say anything, because it wasn't finished at all. In short, this performance did not achieve a perfect effect. However, in the absence of good rehearsals, I greatly admire the actors' talents. But, having said that, talent is not the entire property of actors after all. Progressive playwrights should be as careful and faithful to their careers as possible. I wish them hard work!</p>

<p>— Jing Jia</p>
<p>I bought a tube of Listerine toothpaste and got a Mickey Mouse mask as a bonus. When I put it on, my six-year-old little sister cried out in fright.</p>
<p>My old aunt, who had just come from the countryside, smiled and scolded, "Why are you wearing a mask? There will be days when you have to wear a mask, won't there?"</p>
<p>This is a common saying in my hometown. It means that those who wear masks are bad people. So, when people see others wearing masks, they will try to stop them.</p>
<p>In the countryside, the characters wearing masks in operas are always the villains. Perhaps this saying comes from that!</p>
<p>However, in this world, who isn't wearing an ugly and terrifying mask? If we just pay a little attention to this society, we can find all kinds of different masks everywhere. Wearing a smiling mask while crying in your heart, wearing a crying mask while laughing in your heart. Strange and bizarre, the entire world is living in masks.</p>
<p>Only when dealing with servants, rickshaw pullers, or beggars do people show their true faces. To gain status, you must wear a mask; to get satisfaction, you must wear a mask. In this world, the usefulness of masks surpasses everything else.</p>
<p>This world is [blank space] with masks! [blank space] one [blank space], some [blank space] I don't [blank space] I aunt [blank space] See [blank space], a fake mask is always [blank space] One [blank space]!</p>

<p>丨Discussion Two</p>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>Due to the poor social system and the inability of the people to live abundantly, all desires cannot be fulfilled as desired; coupled with the temptations of external material forces, every youth who lacks material things is trapped in a realm of prolonged suffering.</p>
<p>The cause of suffering can prevent you from being self-motivated and lead you down the path of decadence from which you cannot extricate yourself.</p>
<p>In my early years, around the age of twenty, I also committed this problem: smoking opium every day, going to gambling dens, and visiting brothels, not taking it seriously. At that time, my thinking was really strange. Doing this was considered both "dying happily" and "slow suicide." But inside, it was also full of great contradictions. When I lacked financial resources, I still wanted to struggle in order to eke out a living. So, I could only use a small amount of money to try to get a lot of money, so I went to the dice tables and pai gow dens to gamble. If I lost everything, I would go everywhere to find money. Even now, people still say: "You were really outrageous before!"</p>
<p>Now, setting aside other things, the syphilis that worried me day and night did indeed appear one day. My lower body was tingling and very uncomfortable. I knew that this was not syphilis, but a symptom of gonorrhea.</p>
<p>As for the pain during the illness, it was as Zhong Jun Gu Ren said: in addition to the physical pain, I also suffered ridicule from people. At first, I kept it a secret and didn't let anyone know. But how could I hide it when I was walking with difficulty? Finally, my uncle found out, and he said in a warning and sarcastic way:</p>
<p>"Brought back the receipt!"</p>
<p>I could only lower my head, speechless.</p>
<p>I am truly grateful to my uncle, who told me that no matter how bad the environment is, I cannot abandon myself and destroy a strong physique in such a place. Your body is given to you by your parents. Even if you cannot think for the public, you should cherish it for your parents, "[The mother's heart aches during ten months of pregnancy.] Giving birth to you was not easy." Later, he invited a doctor for me and spent half a year to cure the dishonorable gonorrhea. From then on, I focused on doing things and stopped fantasizing. When the lanterns were lit and the red skeletons appeared on the streets, I dared not touch them again.</p>
<p>I have said a lot without mentioning the method of relieving the pain of venereal disease. This is indeed a major social problem. Several years ago, some people advocated banning prostitution. Facts tell me that after banning prostitution without providing work for them, the number of public prostitutes will inevitably decrease while the number of private prostitutes will increase. Now, the only way to address the root cause is to ask the authorities to limit public prostitutes and strictly inspect the prostitutes every week to see if they have any toxic diseases? Otherwise, order them to stop receiving guests.</p>
<p>Aspiring young people, I hope you will still keep yourselves clean. If you have sexual frustration, you may as well exercise and read to relieve it. Whether this is appropriate remains to be taught by experts. I wish you all peace and send my best regards,</p>
<p>Sincerely, Dai Zuichun</p>

<h3 id="e250">Siamese Ramblings (3) <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Min</p>
<p>3.  Politics</p>
<p>Siam does not have much culture, and the intelligence of the people is also very low. In addition, the climate is hot, like summer all year round, the land is fertile, and agricultural products are abundant. All the necessities of life, such as clothing, food, and housing, are easily solved. They have no political oppression or economic suffering. Apart from lying in the coconut groves and desperately enjoying themselves, who cares about what kind of world it is now! Therefore, no matter how much the modern ideological tide changes, Siam is still a world of paradise. However, the wheel of history is ultimately moving forward. Since last year, the struggle between civil rights and monarchical power has also begun to become active in Siam.</p>
<p>The first coup was in June of the year before last. The participants were mostly retired soldiers and some incumbent officials. When it was launched, probably because the royal family was unprepared, not a single bullet was fired, and the revolution succeeded within a few hours. After the People's Party seized power, the Siamese king was not removed from his throne, but a parliament was created. At the same time, a constitution was hastily drafted in just a few days. Thus, Siam, which had been an absolute monarchy, was transformed into a constitutional monarchy.</p>
<p>In June of last year, Siam had a second coup. The initiator this time was a group of royalists who had lost power. Their slogan was to overthrow "the current Siamese king, who has no definite purpose, cannot manage political affairs, and allows the people to despise the royal family" (the above is based on the leaflets of the rebels) and to establish "Prince Phra Ong Chao Mom Woranartkul Wimonratana." However, the result was a failure. The political power in Siam is still actually controlled by the moderate People's Party. Recently, I heard that there are new brewing. To what extent the political situation in Siam will change in the future is not something that we outsiders can predict.</p>

<h3 id="e251">Prospects for US-Russian Film Cooperation After the US Recognition of Soviet Russia <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Cang Sang</p>
<p>Approaching Each Other Is Indeed Possible</p>
<p>Rumor That Von Stroheim Is Going to Russia</p>
<p>Since the United States and Soviet Russia resumed diplomatic relations, Russia's interest in American films and the film market has been renewed. In the Soviet Russian film industry, directors and screenwriters can be heard talking about this everywhere. They believe that scripts based on Soviet Russian subjects will definitely interest Americans, and they often ask some Americans residing in Soviet Russia for their opinions on completed scripts. As for the Russians' excitement, it is due to the sudden activity of American film merchants towards Russia. Since the United States recognized the Soviet Russian government, representatives and telegrams from American film merchants have repeatedly solicited Soviet Russian films. It was not until recently that further expressions of cooperation were made.</p>
<p>However, because both Hollywood and Soviet Russia have had unsatisfactory experiences in previous attempts at cooperation, neither side is currently willing to actively pursue it. Hollywood is well aware that Soviet Russian screenwriters are unwilling to erase the communist life within Soviet Russia and create something else. Therefore, if American film merchants are eager to change tastes but unwilling to promote Soviet ideology, then Soviet Russian film figures on the private side can only suspend activities and wait for the opportunity. If American film merchants cooperate with the Soviet Russian government on films in Russia, they will also encounter the same difficulties. However, despite this, many figures inside and outside the film industry believe that although Russians have had various failures in the past when they brought Soviet Russian ideology to Hollywood to make films, it is now very likely that Hollywood and Moscow will reach a compromise.</p>
<p>According to the Russians, American film merchants are well aware that there are many novel film subjects in Russia. Using American film techniques and Russian artistic theories to develop Russian materials will definitely yield excellent results.</p>
<p>The Moscow film industry was very excited to hear the news that Erich von Stroheim had petitioned the Soviet Russian government to allow him to work for a Soviet Russian film company. The Russians greatly admired von Stroheim's art and unanimously felt that if he could come to Russia, then with his genius and his experience in the United States, there would definitely be good results.</p>

<h3 id="e253">Review of [All of Me] <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>ALL of Me 丨 Grand Light</p>
<p>First of all, I believe that the most commendable aspect of this film is the director's extremely serious attitude and the highly cinematic artistic expression. Perhaps the name James Hood is still unfamiliar to us, but his directing technique is truly astonishing.</p>
<p>I believe this film should be used as a blueprint for our reference. The entire film is so clear and understandable. It extracts such rich drama from an extremely simple story. Without being verbose or piling up details, it concisely and clearly presents everything that should or must be expressed. In particular, there are three very brilliant scenes that we may as well study in detail.</p>
<p>When the film begins, the director sets up an extremely tranquil scene in order to depict the sweet love between the male and female protagonists. (1) Night, a beautiful garden. A high-angle shot captures the man and woman lying on the ground. (2) A medium shot of the man and woman lying on the ground. (3) The sound of a bell, the camera moves out, a flower dissolves. (4) The bright moon. (5) Then, returning to the male and female protagonists. | This depicts the time from dusk to moonrise. And the sweet words between the lovers are vividly displayed on the screen, inspiring endless envy.</p>
<p>After the male protagonist angrily leaves the female protagonist's home, she sits in place drinking coffee. Her mother enters and asks, "Forgotten him? Is he gone?" "I don't know," the daughter replies with a melancholy tone. Then, the mother asks, "So what do you plan to do?" She replies, "Me? ...I'll drink my coffee." This is the beginning of the unfolding of a new plot, and in these cold few words, the female protagonist's abnormality after losing her lover is fully expressed. But this is not enough; in the immediately following scene, the director depicts her inner feelings as follows: (1) The female protagonist sits alone in contemplation. (2) The maid brings in breakfast, the woman eats a little, then tells the maid to take it away. (3) The woman is melancholic, restless, and goes to the window. (4) She retreats from the window and sits down in her original place. (5) Her mother enters and comforts her daughter. (6) The mother leaves, and the daughter remains silently and restlessly. (7) The maid hands the woman a letter, and the woman tells her to make a phone call. (8) The woman makes a phone call, holding an unopened letter in her hand. (9) A close-up of the front of the envelope. (10) A close-up of the letter. The following dissolves to a sanatorium. | This scene handles the female protagonist's inner changes extremely well. Simple and clear in a static atmosphere.</p>
<p>Next to mention is the climax of the drama. (1) Fast-paced shots of the exterior of a tall building. (2) The fugitive Ani and his lover Eva are in a room, talking anxiously and urgently. (3) Someone is knocking on the door; Ani and Eva are suspicious and dare not open it. Then they hear the name of Sister Li, and they open the door to let her in. (4) Sister Li gives Eva a bag, telling them to escape quickly. (5) Suddenly, they hear urgent knocking on the door; the three are at a loss. Ani and Sister Li go to the door. Eva asks who is outside the door and learns that it is the police who are capturing Ani. (6) Ani goes to the window, preparing to jump, and hears the noise on the street outside the window. His lover urgently embraces him. (7) The knocking becomes more urgent. Noise. Ani explains to his lover. (8) Eva is noncommittal and gradually loses consciousness. (9) Ani puts one foot on the window sill. Sister Li is by the door, watching, and then shouts loudly. (Ani has jumped) The noisy voices of people on the street. (10) The sound of police whistles and ambulances on the street. Sister Li covers her face with her hands. (11) Eva has a dazed, painful expression and decides to jump out of the window to commit suicide. (12) Sister Li leans against the door, watching the window, then stands blankly facing the wall. Noisy shouts on the street. (13) The police break down the door and arrest Sister Li. | | It can be said that this scene fully demonstrates the author's cleverness. What is most noteworthy is that when the first person jumps down to commit suicide, it is shouted out by the female protagonist, but when the second person jumps, it is explained by the voices of people on the street. Neither time do they directly show their posture of jumping out of the window. As for the latter, it is even better to first show Sister Li's unwillingness to watch. What is even more worth learning is the atmosphere created at the time: tense, dense, beyond compare. For example, first depicting the height of the building is actually telling you in advance that those who jump out of the window to commit suicide will surely die.</p>
<p>Well, as mentioned above, the director's technique is truly amazing. In addition, the actors all perform extremely well, so formally speaking, it is truly an excellent film. And the crisp recording and the beautiful photography are just extra details.</p>
<p>Now what I want to talk about is the content of the film.</p>
<p>Here, the playwright raises the question of whether passionate love and marriage are consistent. Originally, this is almost beyond doubt and is not worth specifically raising. However, the playwright first emphasizes that passionate love does not necessarily lead to marriage. That is to say, passionate love is one thing, and marriage is another. When Professor Tang is moving due to work and asks his lover to go with him and get married, she says: "What I want is not to marry you, what I want is to love you, to love you forever... That's so different!... (Passionate love and marriage) I think our love will die from marriage..." This fully depicts the female protagonist as an idealist who believes in the supremacy of passionate love. Later, the playwright uses another poor couple to illustrate that before marriage, there needs to be true love and, even more so, a full understanding of each other. Finally, he tells us through the mouths of the male and female protagonists: "Let's go to Paris for a while." The female protagonist, Sister Li, replies: "Let's go, let's go to the West. At this time, I have completely changed my mind." That is to say, passionate love should have its responsibilities, and marriage, bearing and raising children, is the final stage of passionate love, without a doubt. Furthermore, before marriage, there must be a full mutual understanding and true love, and even if it means sacrificing oneself for passionate love, it is worth it.</p>
<p>Naturally, this is very much to the taste of the petty bourgeoisie. What exactly is true passionate love and marriage built on? We think of the poor couple in this way: they understand each other, they truly love each other, but society does not allow them to live. Although they still struggle for their future children, the harshness of the law, under the so-called name of thief, they commit suicide one after another. So, good results can only be enjoyed between university professors and young ladies. Perhaps this is the playwright's subconscious expression, but we cannot help but have the above feeling.</p>
<h3 id="e254">Random Talk About Wireless Radio Movies <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Yang</p>
<p>Home radio receivers can now be seen in major cities in China. In the near future, wireless movie projectors can also be installed in our homes. We only need to turn on the switch, and we can comfortably watch a favorite sound movie in the living room. This has already started in New York, USA. It is said that the installation fee is about 125 US dollars. If the silver price rises now, we will only need to pay the price of a five-tube radio to install a small home sound theater. Isn't this both novel and cheap?</p>
<p>However, because of this change, I am afraid that the film industry will undergo drastic changes as a result. First, on the part of filmmakers, in addition to continuing to produce films, they will also have to add [sound] and [broadcasting] theaters, and of course their business will also increase. Second, movie theaters will be the first to suffer, because many people can watch movies freely at home, in trains, steamers, hotels, etc., without taking a step out of the room, and the business of movie theaters will of course suffer a major blow. Third, on the part of the audience, they don't have to wait [with bated breath] for new movies, but there is also a drawback, that is, the movie (being broadcast) cannot use outdoor scenes. This is very regrettable. I wonder if it can be improved in the future? Fourth, actors will also be affected in three ways: (1) Blondes - their color is not clear when printed on the screen. (2) Redheads - red hair has no color when printed on the screen. (3) Those with rough voices will be eliminated. According to the test results, black and pale complexions look best when filmed. In this way, black-haired girls such as Dolores del Río, Norma Shearer, Swanson, and Joan Crawford will be blessed with luck. Red-haired girls, such as Howard Keel, Jenny Gaynor, and Nancy Carroll, may be abandoned.</p>
<p>Makeup will also be affected: lipstick will have to be changed to blue, and powder will have to be changed to white. The beards worn by male characters will have to be changed to green glue or green powder. So every event has its advantages and disadvantages, isn't that just wireless movies?</p>

<p>— Wen Yin</p>
<p>After a while, Joanna said: "Oh, so this is what's done in the great and solemn Connelley Mansion... All good, all honorable... So vicious... Specially ruining people's lives. Well, I don't want your land. If so, I still have to run away quickly. I don't want to see such a person again in my life." Will stood at the door, blocking the way and not letting her leave. He said, "Joanna, you don't have to have that kind of thought... That's the past, it's already dead... We have our future!" Joanna said sadly, "You and I have no future." Will said, "We have a glorious future. I have prepared everything." Joanna said, "I don't believe it. You used to tell me you loved me... I don't believe it anymore. You should go back to Charleston and get married..." Will glanced fiercely at his mother, then said to Joanna, "Joanna, there is only one person in the world I want to marry! That's you!" But Joanna shook her head sadly and said, "I don't believe it, let me go. Your mother is right - she is always right. It was right for her to ruin my grandmother's life, too. It is also right for her to prevent you and me from being together. It is especially right for her to drive me away from this terrible place. She told lies - said your uncle died - of course, that was also right..." Before she could finish her words, a terrible sound suddenly came from outside, interrupting her words. Giraldine shouted, "What's wrong?" Shouts of alarm arose outside, and only Scipio's voice was heard, saying: "Oh, God save me! Poor Mr. Robert has committed suicide!" Will and Giraldine ran out in terror. Mrs. Connelley collapsed into a chair, holding her head in her hands. Joanna looked at her once, then slowly walked away.</p>
<p>Everything was packed and loaded into a box. Joanna stood in the stripped-down room, looking around. She could not help but feel sad, and tears streamed down her face. After a while, she urged her younger brother, "Jack, hurry up, the car will be here in a while." As Jack closed the lid of the box, she saw the printed cloth dress she wore when the Connelley family had a dance last time... It was only a short while ago! Will... It was so easy to meet, and so quick to lose him! So she bit her lip tightly, not letting it tremble. After a while, her older brother Harley asked again: "Sister, where are we moving to?" Joanna said almost tearfully: "Far away..." A broken carriage had already arrived at the door. The black driver helped Joanna, Harley, and Jack carry everything to the carriage. Joanna's hands were groping blindly, and her eyes were blurred with tears. Suddenly, someone shouted at her beside her, startling her. It was Li, the owner of the grocery store. Li looked at Joanna's sad face from above his glasses and said, "What does this mean? Mrs. Connelley can't do anything to you. I have checked the law. According to the law, you can live here until the next planting season. By that time, who knows how the world will have changed." Joanna did not answer him. She silently walked back into the house and looked around to see if there was anything left behind. (To be continued)</p>
