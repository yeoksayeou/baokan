<p>全國經濟委員會與敎育部合組之學術工作諮詢處。自成立以來。卽謀與各地職業介紹機關相聯絡。使救濟失業靑年一事。得藉以增進相當之效能。諮詢處曾訂有聯絡辦法。連同［專科以上學校畢業生調查表。］［工作諮詢登記證書］等。分别函送各大學畢業生事務部。請加查照辦理。作初步之聯絡。今日曾受高等敎育之靑年。正苦缺少出路。無法得業。此舉用意。自無非議餘地。第吾人仍有不能已於言者。願一陳之。</p>
<p>今日我國社會間之職業競爭。日趨尖銳。比較高尙之事業苟有空缺。率被一般善鑽營者捷足先得。爲爭奪位置而發生之傾軋種突。司空見慣。恬不爲怪。諮詢處縱有介紹好意。恐亦苦無問津之所不觀乎各處之公私機關。每次錄用人員。援引無非親朋。推轂每出權貴。其有待於公共介紹機關之居間者。可謂寥寥。有之。亦必爲常人所鄙棄而不屑就者耳。政府爲選賢任能計。而有考試制度之成立。然過去兩屆高考錄取人員。數僅一二百人。以政府之地位。分别安揷。猶深感棘手他何待論。聞此一二百人中。能得官職者。不滿半數。其中得力於個人之活動者。尙屬不少。可見謀一職業固屬困難而代人成全亦正匪易。</p>
<p>今學術工作諮詢處謀與各地職業介紹處相聯絡。吾人不能不承認其抱有［集思廣益。］［通功易事］之宏願。然謂藉此一舉。卽能增加得業之機會。直接裨益於救濟。恐未必然。不過箇中責任。則非諮詢處所應負耳。各處門戸觀念之深刻。生産事業之衰微與乎過去敎育方針之失當。皆爲促成失業現象之因素。欲圖根本補救。原有待於全國握有用人權者之覺悟。及敎育生産等事業之改進也惟茲事體大。非可一蹴而幾。在此過渡期間。惟有退求其次而已。吾人乃敢以二事爲請。㈠諮詢處乃羅委會及敎育部所組織。其目的在以介紹手段。爲救濟靑年失業之一助。曷勿先行請求其主管機關。（卽經委會與敎育部。）就其能力之所及。直接安揷才識兼備之失業靑年。以爲其他機關倡。㈡諮詢處應加多人員。擴大活動。除與各職業介紹機關互通聲氣外。更能隨時與京内外操有直接用人權限之重要機關切實聯絡。以爲今後遇缺介紹之準備。此點成效之微。固可逆料。然總望此後各機關中之握有用人權者。漸知識拔眞才。不爲親朋權貴所包圍。屆時。與其由各機關之自行物色。而至感覺失望或灰心。則必不如有一政府機關代表爲色之爲佳也。</p>

<p>日本預算總會加藤質問對滿問題</p>
<p>岡田，廣田，林分别答覆</p>
<p>臨時議會决延長三日</p>
<p>（東京）衆議院預算總會本日上午十時開會、續行質問、今日第一質問者爲加藤久米四郎、加藤關於對滿政策及在滿機關問題、發出質問、並力說關東軍司令官兼任全權大使之矛盾、及改修補强日滿議定書之必要、惹起各人注目、加藤與各大臣之討論内容如次、</p>
<p>加藤問、政府實行改革駐滿行政機關時、有無案亂官紀之事實、又政府有無處罰其責任者之意乎、</p>
<p>岡田首相答、决定改革駐滿機關問題之前、各方面提出不同意見、頗爲遺憾、</p>
<p>加藤問、滿洲匪賊討伐之經過如何、</p>
<p>林陸相答、滿洲現在有小某團之匪賊、散在各所、其數大約三四萬、日軍現在亦繼續討伐中、</p>
<p>加藤問、駐滿大使與關東軍司令官之命令系統如何、</p>
<p>廣田外相答、現在同列之地位、</p>
<p>加藤問、今次駐滿機關之改革、是非一時的改革、</p>
<p>岡田首相答、將來［滿洲國］治安整備、則又變組織、故在此意味、可謂暫時改革、加藤問、駐滿大使與關東軍司令官是非同一人兼任、</p>
<p>岡田首相答、是一人、</p>
<p>加藤問、然則全權大使之候補者限定於軍司令官乎、</p>
<p>岡田首相答、然、</p>
<p>加藤問、陸軍任命關東司令官時、與首相　議人選乎、</p>
<p>林陸相答、任命軍司令屬於統師權、不必與　相商議、然任命全權大使時要商議、加藤於是指　以帷幄上奏被任之關東軍司令官、與待閣議决定後被任之全權大使、由同一人物就任之矛盾、如終肉迫首相、首相答辯　缺明確、</p>
<p>加藤又問、官制成立、則軍司令官在首相監督之下、首相能否完全監督、</p>
<p>岡首相答可以監督、</p>
<p>加藤問統帥問題、監督問題迫擊首相、岡田首相亦與之辯駁、加藤其次言及日滿議定書、</p>
<p>加藤問、日本旣然企圖［滿洲國］之發達、</p>
<p>日滿議定書應要訂結更詳細條約、以計日滿親善、［滿洲國］雖係獨立國、然與日本有密接關係、非由日本積極援助、不能期望其發達、陸相外相所信如何、</p>
<p>林陸相答與加藤君同一意見、</p>
<p>廣田外相答、擁護［滿洲國］之獨立性、非但爲日本之大理想、且係東亞和平之根本、故日本不辭積極援助、</p>
<p>加藤問、其外交工作如何、</p>
<p>廣田外相答、日滿議定書之外不必訂立新條約、</p>
<p>加藤問、外相有無負責補强日滿議定書之意、</p>
<p>廣田外相答、日滿兩國有特别關係、本人擬努力實行職責、</p>
<p>時至正午、加藤暫停質問、會議休息、</p>
<p>預算總會自午後繼續開會、加藤氏關於駐滿機關問題及任命關東軍司令官等等手續、追究陸相、於是林陸相起而作答如左、在决定軍司令官之際、由陸軍三長官商議之後方行决定、一切均認爲妥善至全權大使之軍司令官、自應與首相商議、倘未能經首相同意時、仍須由三長官再考慮、務求與首相之意見歸於一致而後可、</p>
<p>加藤問、陸軍大臣所談係將帷幄上奏之界限與範圍、欲加以縮少本人有此諒解、然國聯駐滿機關問題、爲結束關東廳之警官而發生騷擾、此事是否與拓務大臣之責任有關、</p>
<p>加藤語至此、將其眼光直射首相、於是岡田首相起而答曰、當改革駐滿機關時、一般人士所謂政府部内處於對立狀態之說、决無其事、誤會則有之、但今日該項誤會早經冰釋矣、</p>
<p>加藤問、維持滿洲治安、則憲兵司令官非兼任關東廳警務部長不可、其理由安在、林陸相說明其詳細情形如下、理由有二因、滿洲事態自［滿洲國］獨立以來、已經發生變遷、是以警察之統一、當於滿洲治安上有所必要、故置於憲兵管轄之下、此其理由之一、滿洲行政、其中心在關東廳、是以外間之陰謀、皆由關東廳及滿鐵附屬地而發生、且以［滿洲國］尙未鞏固滿洲心臟卽關東州之警察、亦非置於憲兵司令官管轄之下不可、此事對於該廳警官、固不無若干委曲情形、但事勢上實出於不已、决非軍部壟斷警察權至補任軍司令官則確爲統帥權之發動也、</p>
<p>加藤問、陸相對於日滿議　定書中之共同防衛、抱有若何見解、</p>
<p>林陸相答、維持滿洲治安、决非僅爲剿匪、在隣邦關係上、對於安定内部人心、確立［滿洲國］之基礎、綜合上項各種情形、是謂之國防、</p>
<p>加藤問、聞欲設立日滿間之經濟會議、首相之所信若何、</p>
<p>岡田首相答、在現内閣尙屬未定、</p>
<p>加藤問日滿關稅問題如何解决、</p>
<p>廣田外相起而答曰、現正着手研究、容當實現、</p>
<p>加藤問、關於滿洲新經濟之組織、世上頗有各種風說、所謂國家社會主義頗與我國國情相違背者、在軍部方面應作若何見解、</p>
<p>林陸相答、此事非我所知、但如確立駐滿機關、當不至有上項過激情形、或許發見理想的經濟組織、亦意中事耳、</p>
<p>加藤問、近據一般議論謂擬將［滿洲國］内之關東州附屬地作爲無條件退還、究意如何、</p>
<p>岡田首相答、不能無條件退還、常以愼重考慮爲必要、</p>
<p>加藤氏之質問至此宣告完結、其次當由</p>
<p>淸水氏提出質問、</p>
<p>淸水銀藏氏在預算總會關於如何運用憲政、作槪括之質問、其次對於高橋藏相奏請責任問題、與高橋藏相質疑後、復提出對華外交問題、質其方針、乃由廣田外相答曰、</p>
<p>以維持東洋和平爲根本精神、</p>
<p>清水問、</p>
<p>對華外交是否如外務大臣所說、循其一貫之方針、</p>
<p>廣田外相答、</p>
<p>倘屬日本帝國之方針、僅有其一系、决無兩途之理、</p>
<p>清水氏之質問、至此結束、次由民政黨之齋藤隆夫氏以災害對策爲中心、行使質問後、旋於午後五時四十分暫時休息、七時再開、仍須至深更方得散會云、</p>
<p>第六十六屆臨時議會之會期、原訂於四日滿期、政府現鑑於豫算案討論情形、已於四日午後四時四十五分在院内召開臨時閣議、恊議之結果、决將會期延長三日間、當卽奏准、並於當日在官報號外、將該項詔書公布矣、（四日日聯電）</p>

<p>重申傳統政策不變</p>
<p>維持和平門戸開放</p>
<p>（華盛頓）英美合作、今日自國務總理赫爾發表坦白而愼重之聲明後、已更形堅固、赫氏向報界聲明、對於現在倫敦進行之英美互助合作表示贊成、聲明之措詞雖泛稱世界各國應有比較密切之經濟合作、然其意顯然指英國也、惟赫氏力避表示英美合作係反對日本海軍要求或［滿洲國］之煤油專賣事件、蓋赫氏以爲海軍問題應由三國代表在倫敦討論、而煤油問題應由英美兩國各自單獨辦理也、惟據國務院當局最近重新研究美國遠東政策之結果、已决定維持傳統之和平政策·開放門戸主義·及避免可以引起糾紛之結合、無論其他國家在遠東有何結合、皆所不計、英國當局曾以日本廢止海軍條約以後應取何種行動、徵求美國意見外交界以爲英國之意、係欲成立英美海軍恊調、使美國提出確切之條件、以交換維持遠東方面政治及海軍原狀之英國合作、今日赫氏之談話、則已表示國務院贊成經濟聯絡、惟不願超出經濟聯絡之範圍云、（三日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）國務總理赫爾今日發表言論、批評十二月二日倫敦觀察報所載駐英美大使平漢之談片、謂過去數年來、世界經濟事件、爲極端孤立與國家主義之精审所搗毁、今平漢之言論、可謂爲意在剗除此種精神之工作、美國願與許多國家謀忠實及切于實際的合作、以期掃除國際金融與商業途徑中之障碍、他國儘可以其自己獨立的方法、與美國共同行事云、華盛頓人士咸認赫爾此言爲平漢聲援、但不專注重英美間合作、蓋恐引起日本等國之誤會也、按美大使平漢之言論、要旨在鼓吹英美合作、其詞中有［英美如堅握目前機會、發起密切合作、則世界恐慌不久卽可銷釋、而世界各種外交難題、亦可迎刃而解、如英國與羅總統獲有諒解、則不啻與美國人民成立永久［諒解］等語、（三日路透電）</p>

<p>海軍談判不絕如縷</p>

<p>反動派以致命傷實含國際抗爭意義、原袁逆世凱獨夫自尊時、明知犯天下衆怒、乃以賣國手段、締結亡國之二十一條件、先總理用率吾黨同志、登高一呼、而黄浦革命怒潮以起、賣國賊民之袁逆、因之羞殞、而二十一條件、也因肇和砲聲而碎其法律上之効力焉、此余所以言肇和起義、其效果除一般所認識者外、尙帶有國際之拒戰、和革命理論勝利者也、㈢意義演進革命之意義含有二道、一曰破壞、一曰建設、破壞誠不易、建設尤其難、此種根本原則、先總理對吾同胞同志、已闡明殆盡矣、我人今日紀念肇和起義、誠然一方面在景仰先烈流血的破壞、算路藍縷、斬荆匪易、誠屬要義然時轉歲移、單去仰慕或仿模先烈們的破壞精神、尙非盡責、方今國政統一、軍事時期已過、百廢待興、我同胞同志、在斯紀念先烈的莊嚴中、應本其殺身成仁的聖哲、爲建設百端的雄圖、此革命意義之演進也、東北失地未復、海縮會議破滅、軍縮會議、更屬空中樓隔、而全字經濟之落寞、民情之杌隉、自人類史以來、無有甚於今日者、深望我同胞同志、大具慧眼、在中央領導之下、努力精進、預備爲保衛民族、擁護主義之烈士、則無愧所生耳、而先總理所指揮十九年前今日之肇和起義的急義、將與天地以共存也、余雖不敏、願共勉之、</p>

<p>金融界領袖李馥蓀先生、於本年夏間出國、赴歐美考察、回國後、各團體及報館記者、紛紛要求演講曁發表意見、先生因事務紛繁、未能分頭應約茲囑爲發表下列文件、藉酬各方之盛意、並免願聽先生言論者跋涉之勞、想爲讀者所樂聞也、</p>
<p>國際間衝突、經上次世界大戰之疏解宣泄、曾暫歸和緩、而代興者、乃有各種國際合作運動、然曾幾何時、而世界經濟恐慌發生、自一九二九年迄今凡五閱寒暑、恐慌之前進、未嘗少衰、在恐慌過程中、各國紛求自身之解救、一面高築關稅壁疊、以防阻外貨之侵入、一面復减低貨幣價值以謀海外市塲之奪取、經濟戰爭旣劇、國家主義之氣勢遂高、所謂國際合作云者、乃復成泡影矣、過去軍縮會議之失敗、世界經濟會議之徒勞以及目下海縮預備會議之僵持、皆事實之極顯著者也</p>
<p>市塲有限、而生産力之發展、則日進不已、彼先進各國、倘僅擁國内之市塲、旣不足以消納龐大之生産力、而奪取海外市塲、則又不外以鄰爲壑、輾轉相尋、互施報復、其結果亦徒使市塲日狹、貨銷日滯而已、以此克服恐慌、又何怪恐慌依然、而國際間衝突、則與日滋長、甚且有世界大戰重演之憂乎、</p>
<p>歷觀歐美各國之經濟狀况、其比較穩定者、要推英國、英國之工商業、具有悠久之歷史與厚實之基礎、而殖民地之廣大、又遠過他國、自沃太華會議以後、大不列顚帝國内之主屬各國、進一步取得密切之聯絡、以防止利權之外溢、英國之殖民地政策、向主寛容、殖民地貿易、他國尙能分得杯羹、但年來則因急於自救、不能不逐　排擠他國勢力於大不列顚帝國之外、亦即因此種政策之轉變、英國乃能以對殖民地及國内貿易之增加、抵償一部分對外貿易之損失、藉以緩和其内部之恐慌、而其金融制度之穩健、下足以鎭定人心、上足以影響國家政策、使全國上下、能於驚濤駭浪之中以和易平淡之穩健政策、從容應付、取得高人一着之結果、則尤爲其他各國所不能企及者、</p>
<p>在英國産業界中、其最不幸者、則爲紡織業、藍開夏一帶之凋殘氣象、依然無改、此則因紡織業爲輕工業之一、爲後進國家及殖民地之所易於仿模、中國及印度紡織業之發展、固爲英國紡織業之危機、而其致命傷、則爲日本紡織技術進步之迅速與其工資之低廉、吾人觀於華商紗廠所受日本在華紗廠之影響、固可覘工資高昂之英國、其所受影響爲如何也、</p>
<p>丁此時艱、吾人之所以自處者、又如何乎、當茲國家主義甚囂塵上之際、欲冀以國際合作之方式、援助中國之發展、殆爲夢想徒勞、而自九一八事變以後、遠東均勢之局已破國際合作之方案、掣時多端、顧慮百出、恐亦爲事勢之所不許、吾人欲爲民族爭生存、亦惟有自力自救而已、在自力自救原則之下、尤須權衡輕重、熟籌得失、法則固應取人之長、補我之短、運用則須利賴我之所獨厚、適應我之所切需、凡所設施、務求其利多害少、勞費寡而效果大者、竭全力以赴之、其效乃見、本此意義、則立國大本、應以重農爲歸趨、殆無疑義、吾國在過去五年　、所受世界恐慌之影響、所以較爲和綏者、銀本位之維持、收人集我取之利、固爲原因之一、而以農立國、經濟基礎、散布農村、未嘗集中都市、使恐慌怒潮、失其侵襲之焦點、實爲有力之防衛、歐州國家如丹麥、其恐慌表現、所以較爲輕微者、亦以此耳、離然農村對於恐慌之抵抗、固較能持久、而欲其終於不敝、則仍有賴於國家政策之支撑、我國近年以來、人禍之外、益以天災、農村經濟、漸陷苦境、甚至輸入農産物、年達四五萬萬元、尤屬驚人、以吾國天賦之厚、如能改良農業生産自給固决非難事、若是則目下國民經濟上最嚴重之貿易入超問題及金融問題、均可迎刃而解、初不僅保全固有農村基礎而已也、</p>
<p>在重農政策之下、運輸事業、自須求其發展、否則生産雖增、而盈虚不劑、亦屬徒然、然運輸工具之建嚴、仍須無背于重農政策、建設經費之籌集、固須顷毋傷農村之元氣、運輸工具之作用、尤貴能當疏通農産之重任、循是設施、則礦産亦可隨農産而開發、因天之利、盡人之功、國家基礎之建立斯可事半而功倍、</p>

<p>梁謂午間顧客稀少始往警告</p>
<p>倘有殺人决心何必嘵嘵申說</p>
<p>上虞人梁桐芳、因持炸彈、赴廣東路悅來南貨店警告勿賣仇貨、彈墮於櫃上、以致爆烈、除炸斷梁之右腕及左手兩指外、該店夥三人·顧客一名、均受微傷、當塲由捕將梁拘獲、連同各傷者送往醫院治愈後、工部局即以刑法二百八十四條預謀殺人未遂罪、對梁提起公訴、經第一特區地方法院研訊結果、認梁無預謀殺人之意、依刑法二百條意圖爲犯罪之用、而持有爆烈物論罪、處以徒刑六月、並宣告緩刑二年、梁奉判後、當由上虞旅滬同鄉會等設法向法院保出、仍送醫院療養已詳前報、但工部局對初審判决、殊不滿意、業由經辦之律師王耀堂向江蘇高等法院第二分院</p>
<h3 id="c166">提起上訴 <a href="#c166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>其上訴狀所叙理由、甚爲詳盡、大致謂梁桐芳自在滬加入赤而鋤奸團以後、對於風聞販賣日貨之商號、散發傳單及送達醫告函件、均以如不服從、即行置之死地相恐嚇、據其自白、對於悅來南貨店、亦有同樣警告、同時又有信件送達、而捕房人員、前往被告寓所搜查時、果曾發現該項傳單、是其殺人之動機、早伏於加入非法團體之時矣、後以對於悅來認爲警告無效、乃邀集同志、闢室鶴鳴旅館、共同商議如何實行其最後步驟、亦經自白、商議旣定、遂於十月十九日午時、持極猛烈之炸彈、前往悅來實施殺人、由被告與店夥作三數語後、</p>
<h3 id="c167">卽行擲彈 <a href="#c167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>致傷　夥及顧客等人、按殺人罪以故意爲必要條件、此誠法律所明定、然故意二字、原有一定界說、查刑法第二十六條規定［對於搆成犯罪之事實、明知並有意使其發生者爲故意、］今被告所擲之炸彈、爲即時爆烈之物、一經抛擲、其力量之大、同時可以殺死多人、爲普通人所皆知何况被告曾充兵士、身經戰爭、豈有不知、即其在原審所供、亦謂此項炸彈、立時可以爆發、是則被告明知所用炸彈爲殺人之和器、已無疑義、又據被告供稱在未擲之前、已將保險針取出、是其殺人决心、一本初衷、謂非有意、其誰信之、則爲預謀人、繼毫無疑、復查被告於原判决後、曾於十一月二十四日、在社會晚報上登載道謝各界啟事一則、内有、</p>
<h3 id="c168">屍諫一語 <a href="#c168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>、雖屍諫二字、其本意爲以已死之身、移往他人處作諫、而本案情形、是與人同歸於盡、其間自有不同、然其抱必死之心、　可槪見、原判决對於被告力圖開脫、其證明被告無預謀殺人之理由、㈠被告擲彈之前、意有警告、㈡並非抛擲炸彈、而係失　滑去、㈢抛擲方法、不足以致他人於死、是但知其一、不知其二也、原訴以預謀殺人未遂、情眞罪確、無瑕可擊、原判决不依起訴條文、處以適當之刑、而避　就輕、改依持有爆烈物論罪、處以徒刑六月更從而緩刑之、在法理　旣無一是處、而就已往成例、</p>
<h3 id="c169">同樣性質 <a href="#c169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>之案件、有判處徒刑十二年者、極與前例、亦屬不合、即使被告犯罪情節、害有可憐之處、亦不　曲解法律、抹殺事實、至於如　、徒使人民逞其血氣、蔑視法律、甚或因以爲利、弊害百出、殊非法治國家應有之現象、爲此狀請將原判决撤銷、而處被告以應得之刑云云、昨日下午、由高二分院趙·吳·周·三推事、特開合議庭研訊、檢察官鍾淸、亦蒞庭執行職務、先由趙推事向梁桐芳訊問姓名·籍貫·年齡·住所·後、工部局代表律師王耀堂遂陳述上訴意旨、以十一月十七日之第一審判决、工部局認爲錯誤、所有上訴理由、已備述於理由書内、應請將</p>
<h3 id="c170">原判廢棄 <a href="#c170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>依照原訴二百八二四條預謀殺人未遂治罪、並將刋有梁桐芳答謝各界啟事之社會晚報呈案、趙推事旋向被上訴人梁桐芳訊據供稱、捕房律師所述上訴意旨、我已聆悉、但我確無故意傷人之意、而事前與同志在鶴鳴旅館商榷、亦係討論避免傷人方法、絕非預謀如何傷人、故决於午間前往警告、良以其時方午餐、顧客必鮮也、且事前曾兩度致函悅來警告、勸其當此經濟恐慌之際、萬勿再售仇貨、與敵以利、奈該口不聽、始持炸彈、獨至該店再予警告、因店夥竟不解我之語言、故揭聞報紙、以彈示之、並着店堂中夥友速走、不料此際</p>
<h3 id="c171">手中炸彈 <a href="#c171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>忽然墮落櫃上、以致爆炸、倘我預蓄殺人决心、則足一入店、即將彈向内抛擲、又何必嘵嘵與言、更不致自罹其禍、庭上旋以所登啟事詰之、謂啟事中有不克自殺於該店等語、似有同歸於盡之意、梁即答稱、係同鄉會代爲登報、嗣經我閱見、乃另登報更正、故該措詞實非我之意思云云、庭上以本案事實、已經審究明瞭、遂令開始辯論、仍由捕房律師首先發言、因一切理由、業戸詳述、茲僅寥寥數語、請求將工部局所認爲初審判决錯誤各點、加以糾正、而將被告依預謀殺人未遂論罪、繼由上虞同鄉會延聘爲梁辯護之葛肇基·馮美學·馮步靑·等三律師</p>
<h3 id="c172">次第申辯 <a href="#c172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>謂原判甚公允、今捕房雖仍請求治以預謀殺人未遂之罪、然被告茲復將炸彈爆烈之原因詳細自白、足可證明當時確係前往警告、絕無傷人之意、不幸失手墮落、雖曾傷人、但以梁本人受傷最重、是其犯罪之動機、純屬一片愛國心、激於義憤而起、故寗犧牲、已、而冀喚醒奸商、有所覺悟、國家創制法律、懲治罪犯之最高原則、在使犯者改過遷善、不再重陷刑章、今之被告身成殘廢、事實上已不能仍作犯法之行爲、此後愛國有心、工作則無能爲力、應請審判長略跡原情、仍予維持原判、駁回工部局之上訴、辯畢、趙推事諭候定期本月十一日下午宣判、梁桐芳仍准交原保出外、</p>

<p>春秋小西天  張恨水著　　第五回　諂笑逢迎挑燈照憔悴飢腸驅迫敷粉學風流　　胡嫂子伸了頭向外，將手招着道：喂！你來，你怕人，外面更可以讓人看到，還是到裏頭來躱着的好些呢。月英將右邊的袖子舉起來，放在口裏咬着，低了頭向裏走。走到門口，見小紀坐在裏面笑嘻嘻的，放出一種輕薄樣子來，手扶了門，趕快的向後縮着。但是縮到房門口的時候，他自己忽然的省悟過來了，自己昨天下午，還只吃大半碗油麵一註，爲一種粗麥所磨之粉，作焦黄色，焙熟，以手撮而食，乾燥不易下咽。）今天若是再不想法子，怕是那油麵半碗，也是得不着。這個人不是說過，可以給我們一塊錢嗎？若不敷衍他，這塊錢怎麽可以到手？因之只在這忽然省悟之下，立刻就停止着，不再向後退了。小紀斜了眼向他看去。見他那條辫子雖然梳得溜光，然而面孔上，所抹的粉左一塊，右一塊，很是不勻，身上所穿的那件花布褂子，長平膝蓋，袖子有六七寸大，齊平了手碗，就算他臉子和身材，都長得合式，便是這種不入時的衣服，也把他穿醜了。於是向胡嫂子連摇了幾下頭道：怪不得你自己出馬，事情總是弄不好。很好的人，你給他這樣的打扮，不是把肥肉蓋在蘿葡底下敬客嗎？月英覺得他這話太遭踏人，可是一個姑娘家怎好和生人口角呢？而况還要求敎他，只瞪了他一眼，便算了呢。胡嫂子道：你這是怎麽講話，把人家大姑娘比肥肉。小紀站起來，向他拱拱手道：你若是和我喭嘴來了。你就請便，我是個有事的人，沒那些工夫。你若是有事求我來了，我說這樣句譬方的話，你也不能怪我吧（八二）三女岡  陳警愚　　三女岡，算是我們［奉賢］一個歷史上的古蹟，離開縣治所在的［南橋］鎭，不過一里多路；祇消一出該鎭的北街，如果舉首遥望，就可以把這高聳的土阜，看得一覽無遺。　　大約沒有到過［奉賢］的人，一聽了三女岡這個名字，總當它是樹木葱蘢，泉石秀美的風景區，而爲之悠然神往。　　其實，這三女岡，說起來實在簡陋得很！旣無參天的大樹，也無澄澈的流泉，所謂合乎風景條件的點綴物，一點沒有；所可得而寓目者，厥惟土塚一坏，隆起若丘，古柏一析矗其巓，荒寺數椽踞其麓，如此而已！　　余友梅君耳其名，　余往遊，旣履其地，頻問：［岡在那裏］？余指示之：梅君大呼［上當］不止！余謂：［名聞全國的首都雨花台，不也是一堆泥土？乃能騙盡蒼生，可見號稱古蹟，原屬這麽一回事］。言罷，相與囅然！　　考三女岡之所以得名，無非爲了［地以人重］之故。邑乘載：［春秋時，吳王夫差葬三女於此］；因此遂成千古的名蹟！顧不知此三女云者，是否吳王僅葬其第三女？還是它的三個女兒合葬於　這倒是一個疑問。唯據鄉中老年人傳述：［太平天國時，里人嘗盜發此岡，見石床上陳一骷髏，旁置一巨缶，竊取而出。缶以土質製成，堅緻異常，温潤似玉，陰雨可鑒日光：後夢紅衣女子索取殊亟，懼其爲祟，仍返岡中］。這雖是一種神話；然以屍骨一具證之，則此地下長眠人，自非吳王的三個女兒，而爲其第三女，亦已彰彰明甚！點滴  （楊聲）　　報紙上，常看到一十六歲小姑娘一種化妝品的廣告。意思是說，只要搽用這種化妝品，縱使徐娘半老，也趕得上十六歲小姑娘那　嬌艷的！　　不過，時代是不停地在轉變，我想現在應得改爲一十四歲小姑娘一，纔能打動一般人的心坎哪！供春壺  沉琴　　供春壺，說起來很有些歷史。　　宜興陶器，本來在明朝前便有了，不過是些粗製的吧！到明朝，有許多金沙寺裏的和尙，因爲和陶人很接近，於是在暇時，也就學着做陶器了。　　陶人的製作是營業的，但和尙是自己做着玩的，因此他們有工夫講究，便心靈神會地做出細工的陶器來；這便是開始了後人的紫砂泥貨。　　本來人心是好勝的，於是他們自己有心鬥勝，成績也就與日俱進了。　　當時金沙寺近處，有大人家吳姓家裏，有一個名呌龔春的書僮，常到寺裏去玩，有時也學着做陶器，那知他很聰敏，一方面因爲他沒有做陶器的用具，一方面也是獨出心裁，别創風格，用手指揑成了一把茶壺，壁腔很薄，但很堅實，並且小巧玲瓏，内外隱現着許多手指的螺紋，更覺得美雅無比，盛傳一時，於是把龔春］兩字名了壺，後來慢慢的就混到［供春］兩字上去了。　　現在眞的可失傳了，但仿置了在市上賣的很多，也呌供春壺，栗色的，外面加了許多花紋，輕輕地還可以敲出鏗鏗的金屬聲音來，這是宜興茗壺之一。謹防接觸  士英截髮的故事  醉痴生　　近來據報紙的記載：少女自殺的案件，眞特别增多。往往因家庭細故，爲一時怨忿所迫，便會想個法兒，自戕其生命。如日前本報本市新聞：載滬西曹家渡白利南路，有山東少女盛福德，因向父母要求截髮不遂，復被訓斥，遂萌厭世之念，背人吞服毒藥自盡。卒以受毒過深，送院不治斃命。以如花少女，爲了這些微事，竟斷送其實貴的生命，眞是何等的可悲可惜，我看了這則新聞，便聯想到一段截髮的故事。特寫在下面，足見我貴國家庭專制流毒的一斑！　　在下有位同鄉□君，年五十餘歲。但性情頑固，腦筋陳腐。他守着［女子無才便是德］的古訓：最反對女子入學讀書。他說：女孩兒家，祗須懂得［三從四德］，何必要讀外國書。就是讀些聖賢之書，也祗可讀至十三四歲爲止。過此時期，知識漸開，再要讀書，就難免沾染正由戀愛等惡習。所以他有個女兒，年華十七，早已廢讀了。而且垂垂髮辮，下沒有剪去。伊看見人家少女，都已截髮作時裝，未免相形見拙。今年的春天，便請命於父母，要求截髮，結果，反遭伊父親申斥了一番。伊因未償所願，過了幾天，竟不待父母之命，私自付之幷州一剪。伊想，髮斷不可復續。這樣一來，便無如我何了。不料□君見了，大爲震怒。便把伊深閉在閨中，飲食都送到裏面，不許越雷池一步。說等到你頭髮長了，好結髮辮，再放出來。伊惟有自怨自艾，這樣經過半年多的監禁，纔恢復了伊的自由。現在人家見了伊的一條小辮子，還覺得又好氣，又好笑。不過像這樣專制的家庭，頑固的父親。我們貴國裏，恐怕還炒在少數咧。美味的松蕈  田舍翁　　秋天，咱們家鄉，産了一種味極鮮美的食品。咱們趁這時天高氣爽的當兒，仰天舒嘯之餘，不妨俛着身體，擷些松蕈歸來，請細君烹以佐酒，眞是秋天的樂事，足與［持　把酒］媲美咧。　　冬菰香蕈的鮮美可口，是誰都承認的。但，冬菰香蕈，都是人工栽培出來的，畢竟其味還及不來咱們的松蕈。松蕈野生於山間松樹下面的沙土中，在陰曆八九月時候，方纔可以採覓，别時候産的，都是野草，雜蕈，色澤鮮艷，有大毒，吃了多要送命。據說：味亦極鮮。愚夫愚婦，食圖價賤，往往吃了慘死。眞是和吃河豚一般的危險。所以，咱以爲鄉下人把這些野蕈，雜蕈，在街市上出售，驚察應該嚴厲禁止，把這些毒蕈傾毁外，不妨略處罰鍰；那末，枉死城中也少幾個寃鬼了。　　松蕈，吾鄉呌做［含卷蕈，］因其形狀，故名。宜興人呌做［雁來蕈。］其實，蕈盛時，雁還沒有來；雁來了，蕈却沒有了。據宜興人說：松蕈産在春時，呌敬［桃花蕈；］秋時呌做［雁來蕈；］名很雋雅。但，春夏兩季的蕈，恐怕不是松蕈，吃了很危險，倒不如不吃爲妙。　　松蕈的傘體，須圓小光澤，有捲邊；褶部分須細密；方爲上品。否則，傘體粗大，沒有播邊的，吃起來便覺得觕糙。但是味也鮮美，並不有毒。洗去蕈褶蕈柄等部分的沙泥，便是非常淸潔，用上等醬油，花生油烹煮，便可以佐膳下酒，味美異常。倘若把［味精］拌入蕈入蕈油裏；再把這蕈油，澆在松蕈裏，味无鮮美。用瓷甕儲藏松蕈，可以歷久不壞，不知道現下有否裝做［罐頭食品］啦？　　松蕈屬菌類，與羊齒類，藏薇類，苔蘚類，藻類，地衣類，裂殖類，同爲隱花植物。蕈分爲蕈傘，蕈柄，蕈褶三部，沒有葉綠素。蕈褶裏，有雌器的卵細胞，受精而成胞子，播散地上，漸漸發芽生長，便是松蕈。沒有植物學識的人，以爲松花落地，變化爲蕈，實是不經之談。因爲隱花植物的播種，全靠胞子。胞子落於適於生存（温度，水分，養料等。）的地方，便繁殖起來；否則　死了。譬如顯花植物的楓，梧桐，蒲公英，果　有冠毛，或變做羽翼狀，飛播空中，也爲了播種的緣故。不過蕈類的胞子微小，瞧不見吧了。　　鑑别蕈類的有毒無毒，非常容易，請閱下表：　　　有毒菌　　　　　　　無毒菌　　産地　叢生陰濕之處　　　　乾燥向陽之處　　色　　異色鮮美　　　　　　褐色　　臭　斷面即變靑綠色有烈臭　微香斷面不變色　　光　　黑暗處發光　　　　　不發光　　味　　苦鹹辛澀　　　　　　無異味　　試騐　與銀器同煮銀呈黑色　銀器不呈黑色　　臨了，咱來述一首諧詩吧。某君與僧同食蕈。僧道：你能做蕈詩嗎？某君即應聲吟道：［頭子光光脚有丁，祇宜頭腐　菠　：釋迦見了呵呵笑，煮殺許多行脚僧。一形　畢肖，堪爲絕倒，亦蕈史中的儁語呀。御香縹緲錄  淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯　　這一部份的黄緞上，更用無數的珠子，一行一行，周圍環釘着遠遠地望過去，彷彿是一頭海産的貝殻類動物，伏在他的頭頂上。眞是奇特極了！然而它的價值，却斷非我所敢想像的了。他的脚下是穿着一雙黑緞製的戰靴，這雙戰靴可說是他全部服飾中最簡單的一件了，不但沒有珠寶釘着，且不曾繡半些花紋。　　他的身子是挺得非常的直，足以充分地衣　出他的莊健和勇武來：他的面目更是十二分的淸秀英俊。丨當然，這幅畫像上所表示的乃是春秋方盛之際的乾隆，而决非晚年的寫照。丨我想他對于騎術應該總是非常精熟的因爲我們大家都知道這位大皇帝的生前，乃是一個有名的射獵家，射獵家無有不精騎術的。　　我們再仔細把這幅畫像端相了一會之後，又發現在那馬鞍上還有一件很講究的裝飾品咧！那是馬的肚帶上的幾個扣子。這幾個扣子不僅是純金製的，而且還鑿着很精美的花紋。那馬繮也是皮製的環繞在馬的頸間，並那和肚帶連緊起來，上面另有幾簇紅纓掛着：這些點綴品，極有力地襯出了那馬的雄委來。　　讀者看我寫到這裏，也許已忍不住要問我了，爲什麽單是看了這畫像，我們便能把什麽寶石，珠子，金扣，肚帶，看得那樣逼眞？似乎不是情理上所可能的。（一九一）</p>

<p>自由談欣賞與觀察  毛安柯　　事情往往是這樣：一個創造者不會是幸福者。他甚或會看不到他自己底産物丨那世界有名的［晚禱］油畫，在米闌本身是僅僅幾次麵包的交換品。藝術家永遠是走着這樣地路子，把自己底孩兒流落在商塲中，讓商人獲得了最大的利益。定命論者將歸之於［命運］。　　但這是［欣賞與觀察］來造成了這種事實。　　藝術家是一個觀察者。他對於眼前的事物，是用了銳利的眼光得到了最美而最有生命的印影，於是把那印影機械地叙之於各式的符號（話語，文字，色彩…）中，他自己感覺到已經完成了他底責任。且在這樣地過程中，他底本身幾捫是一個一無所知的木偶丨丨沒有感覺，沒有成見，也沒有意味。藝術家祇是一個攝影機，他祇爲自己底責任或自己底本能地動作，來成就了一件創造物。他很少注意到自己底利益和自己底功績，似乎那祗是别人底事，雖然他人底同情在他是唯一的安慰。至於他底創造物，在他更是一件無關緊要的事。用自己底手把她們毁去，或焚燒，在過去史實中正可以找到很多的例子。他不會如商人那樣地貴重牠們，牠們與他在創造物成了一件東西時候就分離了。所以，藝術家往往不明白自己底創造物將如何地驚震全世界的人類底靈魂。雷馬克底西綫無戰事就這樣地支配了他底生命。　　當藝術家完成了他底使命時候，創造物就游離在人類間。它或者是無聲地死滅，或者是墮落於誑誣裏，或者是拓展了自己底生命在人類間得了生存，這都將是它自己底運命，而藝術家是不會干預牠的。雖然欣賞者底眼睛是向着各種游離物追求着。　　把藝術家底創造物肯定了新的價值，或者說是有了好的評語，使創造物得了生命而活躍在人類間，卽是欣賞者底事。欣賞者雖時當發現了新的事物，而且給與了良好的環境保護了它底永存。可是欣賞者終究是欣賞者，而不是觀察者。欣賞者是用了自己底敎育的，環境的以及經濟的諸條件來對付創造物，把某種創造物給以評價是附合着以上條件。觀察者則否。因此，觀察者底觀察與欣賞者底欣賞是有了裁然的分界。一言了之，觀察者不被陷於以上條件，他往往會是一個自己底環境的，敎育的或經濟的的反叛，欣賞者很少是同樣。我們要想在欣賞者底目光不找尋藝術者底創造物，必須要有一個［懷疑］，不然，失望太多了。反之，藝術家也不必以欣賞者底一切舉動來牽制了自己底使命。　　但我們應該相信欣賞與觀察在將後必有一個歡娛的溶合，使創造者不會再陷於不幸的地位，却使藝術家底手中出來的創造物必有一個新的生命。不過那要待欣賞者與觀察者底敎育的，經濟的及環境的諸條件成了平衡的時候。鼠（上）  蘆焚　　鼠是可憎的，不僅因牠尖臉束　，單看那身灰色外衣，有着短短疎毛尾巴，實在亦醜陋異常。倘是住過學堂的人，和道鼠疫爲害的可怕，只消一想到即覺不安起來，那就非殺不可了。　　然而最不可恕的要算不能亮察人情了。不管人家在午睡，在默想或在談話，竟毫無情義的吱吱喧鬧，這大槪是惹人嫌惡的唯一原因。至於咯勒咯勒嚙破什物，有時在人看來甚至是有意的，單檢人心愛的敗壞，簡直要觸動殺機了。　　幼小時嘗聽祖母唱誦老鼠告狀的曲子，事隔多年，事狀全不記得了，大約是鼠控告貓的無情殘殺，冥王拘貓公到案，貓却提起反訟丨丨不該咬破小姐鳳頭鞋，不該吃盡公子聖人書。冥王大槪也是出身儒家，本有幾分左袒原告的，但一聽到有凟聖情事，爲衛道計鼠反成敗訴，遂命貓永遠捕殺鼠之子子孫孫了。不管怎樣，［人同此心，心同此理］，大家都在厭惡老鼠，可知。上面的故事還只表明了人類惡鼠的心理，只是衛［道］，衛［物］，所以加以咒咀。但還有視爲破壞官星者，現在記在下面。　　還是做十六元月俸的官的時候（十六元的官也有的），照老例，雖不能說終日無事，到底閒却的時候多些，大半以午覺度日。可是天下事不好事事盡如人意，睡覺地方實有着驚人的不靖，老鼠作怪。起先大家滿懷憂慮，還　熬着熬着，尙盼相安無事；即各不相犯。然而諒解終歸無用，縱使多麽賢明的自由主義者，對老鼠也希望各自爲政，到底不免疏於好笑。不管你一氣舒服，吼大扯地的安然睡着，它總是堅甲利兵的樣子，由屋的這首長驅直入至屋那頭，在頂棚上　　然一口氣跑完這叚百碼。精力像還壯得狠，這是須兜幾個圈子方肯罷休的；也許像［刀山斑］的跑馬罷，一面團團團着，一面鼓聲喧鬧。　　［快樂得［二姐］樣的，世界眞好像它們的了！］　　［有什麽辦法呢！］似乎在說人也不曾兩樣，哪家天下，哪家威風。　　［倘有綠氣砲放放就好子。］　　被閙醒的人常常嘆息着，惺忪着兩眼這樣無可奈何的談着的。也别無較善的辦法。　　所謂［無可奈何］，衙門裏常是這樣的，倘有人進去過，即知官吏對於老鼠也是毫無能爲。這裏有的只是權力，逢到權力以外的事只好搔首唉嘆，實有着常人所想像不及的狼狽。官吏的時間大半化在睡覺和不必要的尋樂上。地位低　一點的尤甚。就大體說，下級［官員］是憂鬱的，臉上常蒙着靑灰色的光，很有幾分通俗哲學家的氣象。實際也恰是那樣，除了吃飯，睡覺辦公式的事等等，就是冥想。所想大半是些取笑私自己同等地位者或土娼的材科，但未必眞笑，倘笑了，倘笑了的話，也不過因爲吃得過飽，想使肺部行筋肉運動才笑的。或者想毫不驚人的警句；或者吹大家都知的牛皮；再不然打幾個閴暇的呵欠；夜晚到土娼家裏打牌，如此總算消磨過一天時光。在他們原也不過無意識的做做，否則眞就怕會那樣一旦死了。　　老鼠是很可惡的，不單白天横行霸道，就是夜間也從無一刻安寗，吱吱呌着。大槪是號召同夥了。接下去是一陣馳騁。可不知是倦了或是怎樣，賽跑歇下來定要磨牙的，在夜深被驚醒的人，那咯吱咯吱的聲音簡直是嚙心的苦楚。老鼠雖然一向怕貓怕得入地無門，沒有貓的所在膽子是很大的，常常吃掉整疉的檔案，有時竟敢出來逍遥散步；然而這羣［官］却絲毫奈何不得它。衙門裏養貓似乎被大家公認爲不名譽，翻閱前任，以至前任的前任的案卷，亦未嘗有養貓的事可查。只好嘆息。　　不過有這麽一天，事情來得眞有些不平常了。原來是有個綽號呌作［烟突］的人，我們在一處辦事，同樣的職務，不過爲他是薦來的，所以每月［俸祿］多出兩元；所以下午買來一雙新鞋子，不料夜裏即被老鼠咬了個銅錢大的洞，又恰在脚尖上。自然，並非即是說鼠子的咬鞋和兩元月薪有什了不得的關係。　与　  ＴＫ再跋［蚌壳生羅漢］  陳子展　　自從我在自由談發表了［蚌壳生羅漢］［跋蚌壳生羅漢］兩文，隨後蔣鴻禮君來一篇［蚌壳生羅漢科學的解釋］，我們纔知道蚌壳上的羅漢並不是自然生長的，乃是人工膺造的，震旦大學博物館藏有兩片這樣的蚌壳兩片。不知道蚌壳生羅漢這個底藴的，當然覺得稀奇，如今大家都知道了，［那末，又有什麽稀奇呢？］蔣君這句話一點也不錯。　　頃從阿英先生寄來兩條筆記，據云出在鄭仲夔胄師所著雋區第七卷玩雋裏。一條說：　　天啟丙寅歲，浙江烏程縣雙林鎭河下，蚌忽出珍。有一人獲蚌，剖之，内有珍珠八仙，及珍珠奪星。又一人持二蚌出水，將及岸，忽　一於水中，再覓不得。取其一剖視，有珍珠象棋子十六枚，與前所墮水者必一副也。其人不勝怏怏，事在是年七月望日。　　蚌壳裏的珍珠八仙，珍珠壽星，以及珍珠象棋子，也都出在浙江地方。大約吳越江淮一帶地方從宋元時代就有人愛幹這種蚌壳上的把戲，到了明朝，蚌壳上鑲珠造象，不限於佛菩薩一種，仙道也有，甚至運玩具一類的象棋子也用珠珠鑲在蚌壳上了。但在當時的人對於這種東西總不免覺得稀奇，今如經人道破，半文不值，又有什麽稀奇呢？還有一條筆記是這樣的：　　朱幼晋曾於冰谿畔得一片石，紫黄相雜，光潤如玉，下有趙松雪題六字云：［女媧補天之餘］。又在臨海水際，得石葉一片，其色紫，發光彩，可作硯，當是玉樹之屬。　　倘若有人拾得［女媧補天之餘］這塊姜石，就認爲這是女媧氏的遺寶，那就不免笑話了。兩種生活的素描  仃　　我的家鄉是白莎，那兒農民的生活是很辛酸的。他們一年四季都是忙着，忙着耕耘，忙着收割，忙着踏榖，忙着借債，忙着籌今天的米明天的飯。總而言之，他們是無時無刻不在忙着，他們簡直沒有空餘的時間，休息的日子，一個可以安寗過活的時節。他們在炙熱的太陽下被拷裂了腦壳般工作着，他們在凛烈的寒風中被吹得僵凍手般工作着，他們在傾盆大雨下被淋得週身是水的體魄工作着。忙着，工作着，然而他們的生活始終擺脫不了饑寒，痛苦，他們是在田裏的深處生活着。這就是我家鄉的農民。　　在他方面，另有一種人，他們的生活雖說不見得怎樣愜意丨可是與貧窮的農民一比，却有天淵之别。他們不用愁穿憂食，他們不用忙，不用工作，他們擁有許多的田地和錢糧，藉着他們在鄉間的勢力與權威，他們可以使農民能死能活，他們使農民不得不卵翼於他們之下，爲他們工作，爲他們賺錢，爲他們造成優裕的一種境遇，所以，他們的生活畢竟是幸福的。　　然而，從整個的白莎來說，是蕭條，破落，窮窘的。因爲家鄉已被［外來的］一種勢力所侵略，所剝削了。　　踏出了白莎，到了城市，這兒　又怎樣呢？　　不錯，廣州是繁華的，廣州是熱鬧的，廣州是擠擁着許多許多人的。倘要我下個比喻來說，從外表來講：正如一個是地獄，一個天堂。　　白莎日裏是蕭條的，夜裏是黑暗的。　　廣州呢？日夜一樣。車水馬龍，五光十色，無所不備的。這兒有種種奇形怪狀的東西，聞所未聞的事情，這兒有十三層高揷雲霄的大新公司，有容納一二千人的中華影院，有滿街全是經營綢緞的下九甫，有娼館林立的燕塘及長堤，有　地皆是烟賭的河南。有租界，有外國戰艦，有工廠，有飛機塲，應有盡有的…………　　然而，這兒工人的生活也是非常辛酸的，他們忙着工作，忙着打鐵，忙着紡織，忙着做活，忙着今日的飯明日的米。他們每天要幹十五小時以上的工作，每月只得十來塊錢的工錢，除食宿之外，他們也是一無所有的。他們住的是冷巷窄街，破屋舊茅，他們穿的是骯髒殘破，吃的是粗米靑菜，他們時時刻刻的忙着，流盡他們的汗血，蹙眉苦臉，仍舊擺脫不了饑餓，痛苦。　　那麽廣州另一種人是怎樣呢？他們的生活幸福極了，他們擁有許多工廠，地産，企業，錢莊，資本………他們不用勞働，用資本來收買生産力。他們吃的是山珍海錯，穿的是紗綢緞錦，住的是大厦公館，他們沉湎於酒色的生活裏。　　人雖是一樣的，世界也是這一個，然而彼此所得的却完全不同。明天（八）  （Joseph　Conrad著）吴向隅譯　　如果他仍舊登廣告招尋他的兒子，他可不再對於通風報信的人有賞格；因爲從他的複雜混亂的心理中，他推出一種堅定的信仰，認爲在那種方法下，他所能希望的效力都已達到。他還要什麽呢？柯爾柏魯克就是可以找到他的兒子的地方，這就够了，不須再求别的。嘉維爾小姐稱讚他的好計劃，他也被她的贊同他的希望得着安慰，那種希望已變爲他的痴想；這種痴想使他的心理上對於眞實與可能性的辨别力都喪失，正如别一個小屋中的老人，因爲别的病失了明，對於世界上的光與美喪失了辨别力一樣。　　但任何他認爲可疑的事件，丨丨任何不同意的冷淡，或者，甚至任何對於他的替他的回來的兒子與兒媳組織家庭的計劃不以爲然，都會激起他的跳脚大駡與惡意的白眼。他會把他的剷用力揷在地上，在那前面走來走去。貝珊小姐啈這是他的惡癖。她向他摇摇手指。在他因爲惱怒與她離開，她再走出來的時候，他用他的眼角，窺察那極小的暗示，可以鼓勵他有勇氣走進鐵栅，恢復他的父親般的慈愛的關係。　　不問他們怎樣經過幾年的交誼，他們從來沒有走到他們木栅或鐵栅的外面去談話過。他形容怎樣造成一切他們的家室的一切富麗情形給她聽，但他從來沒有請她去看過一下。除非哈利看過第一眼後，沒有人可以看見它們的。事實上，沒有一個人曾經到過他的小屋内過；他自己做家裏的雜務，他非常嫉妒地保護他的兒子的權利，因此即是他有時從鎭上買來做家用的小物件，也藏在他的大帆布上衣中很快地從前面的圈子偷運到他的家裏去。隨後走出來抱歉似地說：［那不過是一把小水壺，我的親愛的。］　　如果她沒有因爲做苦工而過分地疲乏，或沒有被她的父親過分的麻煩而煩惱，她總帶羞澀地笑着對他說：［沒有什麽，海格波特船長；我不是沒有耐心的。］　　［唔，我的親愛的，現在你不會久等了。］他這樣回答，突然感覺羞愧，並且看起來也有些不舒服，似乎他懷疑他什麽地方做錯了事一般。　　每一個［星期一］，她從鐵栅上面遞過房租給他。他很貪心地抓過那幾個先令。他吝惜他化用在維持生活的每一個便士，當他離開她去購買東西的時候，他的舉動一走到街上立即改變。離開她的特有的憐憫心，他覺得他自己四面受攻擊。他用他的肩靠着牆。他厭惡别人的奇異的舉動；但是到了那時候，即是鎭上的孩子，都走出來追隨着他喊呌；商人做他的生意，不對他說一句話。即使稍許講及他的衣着，也就有特别使他疑慮受嚇的力量，正像這是一件完全不合法的，不可思議的一件事一樣。　　在秋天的時候，急雨打在他的帆布衣服上，裏面飽含着雨，使那衣服差不多像生鐵一般的堅挺，衣服外面的水直流下來。當大氣太壞的時候，他退縮在那小走廊口，身體緊靠在門上，看着那揷在天井當中的剷。那地上因爲翻了又翻，因此當時　深秋，那地方變爲泥潭。當那地凍結得堅硬以後，他心頗不安。哈利要說什麽呢？到了一年中這個時候，他因爲不能常常和貝珊在一起，老嘉維爾的怒吼，呌她到裏面去，從關閉的窗戸中含糊地他過來，使他極爲失望。　　［爲什麽那過分的傢伙不替你僱一個用人呢？］他一天温和的下午不能忍耐地問。她把一件東西摔到她的頭後面，跑出去了一會。　　［我不知道］，面孔慘白的貝珊說，樣子是很吃力的，她的厚沉的眼皮灰色中包含游移不定的目光向旁邊注視。在她的眼底下說是灰暗的黑影，她似乎不能看到她的生活會有什麽改變，或告一結束。　　［你等待到你嫁了吧，我的親愛的］，好的唯一朋友一方面說，一方面更向木栅走近些。哈利一定只娶你。　　他的充滿希望的妄想看起來似乎在嘲笑她自己的缺乏希望，這種怨恨的性情，在使她的神經被刺激，足以使她立即向她驚啼。但她只不過自嘲般地地當他是神智淸楚般地對他說：［唔，海格波特船長，你的兒子也許連看我一眼都不願意。］　　他把他的頭仰向後，喉頭發着咯咯地帶些佯怒地大笑。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言死讀書和讀死書（上）  吹　　死讀書是讀法的不好，讀死書是讀本的不佳，我先來談談死讀書吧。　　談起讀書，我便要汗毛管根根豎起，因爲想起小時的讀書方法，眞是怕人，早上八點鐘，便要到學堂，（這個學堂，並不是現在的洋學堂，是一個私塾）到十二時放飯，半點鐘又要進去，至五六時放學，弄得不好，還要［關夜學］，使你不得出去，其間除撤尿，假吃茶外，絕對沒有使你偷息的餘地。　　每年放學的時間，亦極很少，大抵正月十六日開學，便要到淸明節，纔得放假三天，端午三天，八月半三天，直要到十二月二十二三，方放年假，年假時期又短，至多不到一月，試想從前的讀書，一天讀到晚，一年讀到頭，是何等樣的苦事，故一看見學堂，便要不寒而慄，一入學堂，便像强徒跌進了西牢一般，絕少出獄的希望，所以做學生時，有句口號［不望先生死，只要先生爬不起］因先生死了，換一個先生，還是一樣，最好使他生病，旣不好到校，又不好換先生。　　至於日常的課程，又如牛馬般被先生壓緊，每日總要上一首生書，（今天敎，明天背，）二十餘頁的帶書，（所謂帶書者已熟而未十分純熟的書）又要温幾本書，（卽已經熟讀的書）這三種是日常必要的科目，此外還要寫字一張，萬一有種書讀不熟，背不出，留心你的小手心，非打得你一佛出世，二佛湼槃不可，打後拿去再讀。　　所讀的書，又是怎樣書呢？我索性再交代一下吧，除方塊字不算外，便讀［孝經］［詩品］［幼學］等書，再次便要讀［大學之道，在明明德］的［大學］［中庸］，再次讀［論］［孟］，再次讀做五經博士的［五經］，再次讀［左傳］［古文］，而門館先生的敎規，又是這樣的規定，非讀到［左傳］［古文］，先生是不開講的，所以講書的先生，比較不講書的先生，束脩要從豐一些，　　因此我們讀書的時候，書中的意義，簡直是莫名其士地堂，並非先生的不肯講，試問八九歲的小孩子，替他們講［大學之道］，在明明德］，學生們如何懂得？並且所讀的書，又是先難後易的，據幾位老於吃敎書飯的先生說，這呌做［先端其本］，不過先生旣不肯講，學生又未明瞭其意義，這本怎樣端法？眞是天曉得啦。　　所讀的書，旣這樣的繁難，而讀書的時間，又那樣的攸久，不是死讀書是什麽？及至開筆作文，又須讀八股，（就是所謂時文，科筆未廢，黄金屋顔如玉多在其中）如小題拆字之類眞是金科玉律不可不讀的書，據一位老先生說，他少時讀文章，就拿這一篇文章，用漿糊粘在桌上，讀了幾百遍，或竟至幾千遍，必定要使這文章，能吞口而出，方纔揩去，再來一篇，吾鄉有一位經學先生，名張文遠者，他早上起來，先要讀［史］［漢］三十頁，方吃早飯，到晚年還是如此，這樣的讀書，眞是實做到一個死字，這樣眞呌做死讀書。</p>

<p>生活在露天的人們  朱莉　　大槪是今年的夏天吧，我們弄口過街樓底下發現了一對類似夫婦的男女組織了他們的臨時家庭。因爲一扇鐵門常關的緣故，他們在角落裏安置了一個煤爐，及一切破碎不整的用具，有一條已經變了黑色的破棉絮，夜裏攤開來作爲床舖，日裏就摺疉了作爲凳子。起初管弄堂的不允許他們佔據這不化錢的地盤，他也曾徵求大房東的意思，可是後來妥恊了，管弄堂的非但不驅逐，反而時常接濟他們一點殘羹冷飯。原因是簡單得很，因爲他們是同鄉。　　這一對夫婦居下來後，管弄堂的簡接也受惠不淺，就是半夜裏這弄内居戸出進，開門關門的職任由這一對夫婦代勞了。當然，這年頭見人類是互相利用，互相傾軋的！　　我第一次見他們的面，已在他們搬來後一二個月了。我家裏人雖然告訴過我這麽一回事，同時我每天出進也看見這簡陋家庭的陳設，但是我出門的時候，他們已先我出門了；我歸來，他們還遲我歸來，見面的時候就顯得很難了。　　那一天我歸家已在午夜，那男的開了鐵門，在微弱的燈光下，他給我的影像並不壞，他有一張白晳的臉，温雅的談吐，似乎不類那些街頭的流浪人。我很想同他多談幾句，他的妻子（？）却駡他不懂事，半夜三更拉住人家多說多話，並且她向我道歉，最後客氣地道了明天會。自然我也瞧淸楚了那女的，她更不像一個乞丐婆。如果作一個不甚適當的比喻，好像我們日常所遇見的人物中很多是他們這一類的典型。　　於是我對於他們這一對夫婦，由懷疑而想探一個水落石出。但是先面已說過，我們碰面的機會很少，而且照第一次見面的情形看來，那女的似乎不願意她的丈夫多說多話，這裏面大槪就隱藏着一個秘密，要打破這個秘密，就得找那男的單獨的時候。　　我旣存了這個心，就隨時隨地探查他們的行動，誰知道在我還是一無所得的昨天，這個臨時家庭無聲無息的搬走了。我想問我的家人，家人已作爲一件大事般的告訴我，那經過是這樣的。　　僅僅是四個月的時間，這一對夫婦已同弄内任人家很相熟了。據他們自己說因爲故鄉年荒逃到上海來的，現在幹着拾垃圾的生活。更因爲他們做人勤儉，空的時候，他們能够帮助人家，爲了這便利，他們似乎也是這弄内的重要人物了，而事情就在這裏發生。　　昨天，我們鄰右的小孩，手上的金鈴遺失了，適巧那女的抱過半天的，所以，在沒有結果的時候，疑惑好是最好的一個答案。管弄堂的就自告勇奮檢查他們的行裝，但是失主說得好，這樣貴重的東西他們不會寄藏到别處去嗎。最後自然羣起責難管弄堂的引進這一對同鄉的狗男女來。　　事情沒有大白。這一對生活在露天的夫妻莫須有的被驅遂了。今天管弄堂的笑着對我說：　　［我早知道他們不是好路數］！　　自然，這年頭兒人類是互相利用，互相傾軋的！方與圓  小鶯　　這年頭，什麽都不景氣，减價的市招，人們口里的漢息，都不足爲奇，都成了司空見慣。假在夜靜更深的時候，凈巧的經過了娼妓集中的地方，那，被兇惡的拖拉，也是不足怪的。　　據燕京大學敎授蓓克的考察，在上海的人口中，每一百三十人裏有妓女一人，以全上海的人口密度來統計，這數目，眞够可觀。　　然而，大都會是天堂，大都會是，舖着金子的世界，在資本主義的社會中娼妓也同其他的商品一樣，在集中着。　　×××××　　天氣冷了，西北風刮到臉上有點颼颼地，在更深以後，應時的出現着一種人，敲着梆子，嘴里在喊着：［天宴了，爐火要當心，前門看看，後門拴好，晒臺也要拴緊。］來去的在弄堂裏踱着，一趟，以至於好幾趟。　　這目的，在勸戒着住戸免得失愼。不然，那西北風是無情的，也許會［風趁火勢，火助風威］，頃刻之間化爲灰燼的，這，對於生命財力都有着相當的損害。　　但是，勸戒和梆子，對於草棚里的住戸似乎絕緣，在這冷風的怒號下，草棚裏的住戸還得要自己注意［天宴了，爐火要當心］的。　　×××××　　一到冬天，照例的得有冬防，原因在保［閻閭的安揖］。　　想到閻閭的安揖，聯帶的就想到爲衣食所迫挺而走險的人。近年來，中國的天災匪禍，在交相煎逼，從前富庶的省份，現在也被連帶的波及了。所以，要想使地方上安靖，首要的方法，是應該從安撫災民入手。　　現在，本市的普捐運動開始進行了，不用說，這企望是想使受災的同胞能得些實在的惠助。在這裏，我們希冀着這運動擴大，在這裏，我們希冀着這運動能有美滿的結果。　　×××××　　據國際貿易局發表近十個月來，香水，化妝等用具，計：脂粉香水，一四五一七八八元，化妝用具，四八六五七二元，眞假首飾，二九八○四四元。這些，都是婦女國貨年的漏巵，而這漏巵的銷耗者，是不難想像得到的，當這臨去的歲尾，我們在企望着明年能有可喜的現象。農村素描　　噲，城裏客人到涯（我）裏來坐坐劍俠  陳眞　　一個多月以前，我在一個小飯館裏，認識了兩個人。我平常，是很喜歡交朋友的，並且無論什麽人，和我稍爲談幾句話，便會同我立刻成爲知已一樣的。這或者是我的［本事］吧，總之我時常暗暗引此爲榮。而那兩個人，也像這樣，沒有說幾句話，便和我弄熟了。　　那是一對兄弟，據他們自己說；但是不管怎樣，親暱是親暱異常的。雖然明明打着安徽口音，他們却聲言是南京人：而這次到上海，據說是遊歷來的。　　他們問我職業，我說：［寫文章。］於是他們說一聲［好極啦！］，便背起他們近作的舊詩來。他們問我的學歷，我說：［北京××學校。］於是他們和我　了同學。接着我談起我的家族，於是他們又和我攀了個世交。［這兩個傢伙倒有點古怪！］這時我暗想。　　這一下該我發問了。［你們做什麽貴業？］我問。　　我們嗎？我這弟弟，］那哥哥指着弟弟說。［現在是在××部做着事。而我，自××學校畢業後，因得異人指點，一直幹着軍隊。］　　［哦？這倒是件奇事。怎麽得異人指點的呢？］嘴裏雖然這樣好奇地間着，我心中却更加緊地提防他們起來。固然這也只是片刻間的事；當我想到［卽使他們是歹人，我也沒有什麽可被害］時，我隨卽把心放下來了。　　這時哥哥一邊比着種種手勢，說出了這樣的事丨丨　　當他們住在北京時，有一個瘦弱的老人，寄居在他們家裏。他雖迷迷糊糊聞說那老者是一個劍俠，但是老者本人却死也不承認。可是有一天淸晨，他終於察破了老者的秘密：他因事跑到老者房間裏去，看見老者正在弄着一個發出電閃一樣的光芒的球丨丨而這便是［劍］的正體。老人因爲被他察破了自己的秘密，沒有法子，這才答應收他爲徒，傳授了他幾路拳法，水火二功，以及相骨之術。……　　［你明明在騙我呢！］聽了他的話，我在心理暗想，並且漸漸不耐煩起來，便說：　　［劍俠這樣東西，究竟存在嗎？］　　［哦！那，你不能說沒有！］他不勝驚愕似地說。　　那末日本人打東三省，打上海時，怎麽我也沒有看見有什麽劍俠出來，爲國效力呢？］我當眞冒起火來了。　　［你要知道；那是天數！天數是不可以違悖的！］　　［那末這樣講來，練了本領，做了劍俠，還有什麽用處呢？］我冷笑。　　［那是呌你保護自己的！］那哥哥，開始窘起來了。　　［那末倘若你之被傷害被殺死，竟也是天數呢？］　　［那……那……］　　正在這當兒，堂倌把兩張帳單送上來了。這時那弟弟單單把他們自己的一張拿起，看了看，對我說一聲［我們大家不客氣了！］，付過了錢。並且兩個人，連聲向我說着［再見！］，像遭驅逐似地走出去了。夜  毓炯　　峭然的風，從偏僻的巷裏頭到達四層樓的晒臺上，吹動了晒臺上面所晒着的幾件長衫，飄飄的。她無精打采的援着晒臺的石子，遠望大街上耀起的電炬的輝暈，照得幕碧紅，像起了火。又是，這光色到底太微弱些，只令人想到在那下面有不感覺黑暗的人活動着；並不會使僻巷的人忘掉沉重的幽寂正掩埋着大地，宣洩着恐怖！　　在火燄，煤烟，油腥，水汽所濕成的氛園中，她臉上常曾現出恨與怒。雖然她在用力抑制着，不讓她們發洩；但，陰暗沉重的，焦悶的，緊迫的現實，使她鈎引起隨時可以呈現於意識的，痛心的記憶。這記憶對她是太深太强了，每天在内部攻擊着她，要衝破她，撕裂她。　　夜是漸漸的深下去，風，更起勁的呼呼的吹着發嚮，人影漸漸消散在這夜的威脅中；路燈顯然沒有先前那般明亮，微微的在馬路兩旁曳摇着牠最後的光芒。在夜裏，往往那記憶的内容，是更複雜的易於引起她深刻的刺激，那刺激一够勁，那記憶的毒汁便湧了上來。　　嗒啼啼嗒的鐘聲，從室内映進了她的耳膜，由於外間人們的消散，這時她便拖着疲乏的眼皮，開始回到室内躺在床上。整天的疲勞，反而給了好格外的興奮。　　藍闐的氣氛，透進了這一間沒有窗口的屋子，藉着幾條木版牆壁的縫隙，來透氣，雖然仍在蠕動的活着，而沒有充平的空氣來營養，生活在這末一個圈子裏，生命是多末飄渺飄渺！　　爲着生活她曾經幾次幾乎犧牲了她的性命，在叢叢的荆棘的路程裏跋涉過；雖然，過去的却像浸在什麽濃液　，悶重！然而她却侍着最後的英勇的氣力，去開拓那一匹陌生的山路。　　窗上的燈光，在銀灰天色中消逝；月亮斜到西邊，還沒有落下，在這夜裏，她時常回首着過去，期望着將來的一顆光明。</p>

<p>業餘信箱家庭不准我升學編者先生　　現在我有一個有關終身學業的問題，想請先生給我一個圓滿的答覆。　　我是一個將要畢業的初中學生，根據我的家庭的經濟能力，我還有升入高中的可能。可是從最近我父親的意思看來，他是不願意再讓我繼續去讀書了。他希望我在畢業之後，替我找一個事情做做，一則可以减去家庭一筆鉅欵，同時或者還可以補助一點家用。但是我自己却覺得我的學識很淺薄，不够應付社會的一切，並且在這失業人數極夥的時代，憑我這個初中資格的人，能找到一個什麽好的職業呢？所以爲了我將來的幸福，我决定要求升學，以求較高的學識。所以在近兩日内我曾向我家庭談過幾次，要求他們滿足我的求學慾。可是他們却很堅决的，很固執的拒絕我的要求。因此我與家庭間的意見便發生衝突，我本想和他們决裂，但是又想决裂之後將要斷絕經濟的來源，那末，不但不能求學，並且個人生活也不能維持。但就此向家庭屈服，畢業就停止讀學吧，又覺前途太無希望了，人生太無意思了。所以我現在想假使不能達到目的，還不加死了乾凈，免得將來受苦。先生，你是迷途中的指南針，在我這種環境之下，究竟呌我怎樣辦呢？敬希賜予答覆爲幸。此祝撰安　　編者按：一般人不能升學的原因，大半是由於經濟方面的困難。像季君的家庭雖具有供給子女繼續求學的經濟能力，但他們却不顧季君將來的幸福，堅决的呌他停止求學，改謀職業，似乎太少見了，太固執了。現在根據來信的意思，編者假設了幾個步驟，以供你的參考。㈠現先爲託親友設法向你家庭婉商，希望他們能够改除成見，允許你的要求。㈡假使他們一定不答應，那末只有再由自己向家庭懇商，或向其吵鬥，堅持升學之志。到了他們煩不勝煩的時候，也許就可以允許你了。㈢自殺是弱者的行爲，希望你不要因爲失學就想到死路，但是到了毫無挽回餘地的時候，不妨用［死］來向家庭恐赫。我們想長輩總是愛子女的，他們絕不會讓你去死，所以你假以拚命去要求，那末最後還是可以達到你的目的。　　假使你另外有什麽借貸或工讀的機會，那更好，你就不必向家庭去要求了。　　最後，編者的意思是認爲各種學識不限定在學校裏可以得到，一個人隨時隨地都有求學的機會，服務也是在求學，並且我們認爲只有實際的生活經騐纔是眞正的學識。　　不過這種話是對於那些無力入校求學的人而說的，假使有能力的話，當然還是入學讀書的好。無綫電播音莭目歌唱　　新華社　　敦本（八○○）下午五時至六時　　開鑛歌（嚴華）夜戰塲　從軍别愛　得勝凱歌歸（嚴斐）單想思（嚴華）新漁光曲（周璇）鴻雁寄想思（徐健）寄來的吻（周璇）碧沙窗外（徐健）　　大中華（一一六○）下午六時至七時　　花生米（嚴斐）鮮花新婚（周璇）綠裙隊（徐健）因爲你太美（周璇）夜半的私語（嚴斐）戰地之花（徐健）開始的一吻（凌莉）求愛秘决（凌莉）　　芙蓉團市音（一三四○）下午五時至六時　　風雨琴歌（包雪雪）相見訴相思（黄韻）蝶戀花（露茜）春又來（雪芬）山中美人（黄韻）新婚燕爾（露茜）花心曲（包雪雪）　　安定（八六○）下午七時至八時　　夜來香（雪芬）叮叮當太太（包雪雪徐文壁）恭賀新禧（黄韻）紫羅蘭（露茜）夜戰塲（包雪雪）薔薇之蕊（黄韻）　　華興（一二六○）下午八時一刻至九時　　春潮回來吧（露茜徐文壁）賣花女（雪芬）人間仙子（包雪雪）麻雀和小孩（全體）春宵曲（黄韻）休息五分鐘（露茜）　　大中華（一一六○）下午九時至十時　　賣花詞（雪芬）賣報歌（徐文壁）這回事情太希奇（黄韻）摩登姑娘（包雪雪）廣州小姐（露茜）夜月之歌（黄韻）拒絕（包雪雪）　　中西（一○四○）下午十時一刻至十一時　　文明結婚（雪芬）淸伴（雪雪黄韻）等一等（露茜文壁）昭君怨（黄韻）叮叮當太太（雪雪文壁）　　星光競音社　　華光（一四八○）下午五時至五時三刻　　漁光曲（游泳）姊妹花（黄喋）春光曲（胡瑛）夜花園裏（陳競芳）蝴蝶姑娘（游泳黄喋）夜來香（瑪琍）風雨歸舟（薛陶）　　東方（一○二○）下午六時十分至七時　　風雨歸舟（黄喋）摩登變愛（游泳）永别了吾的弟弟（胡瑛）飄泊者（陳競芳）好朋友來了（黄喋游泳）花弄影（胡瑛）　　利利（一二四○）下午十時十分至十一時　　丁香山（胡瑛）春潮回來吧（黄喋游泳）人面桃花（陳競芳）龍虎鬥（胡瑛）别矣巴黎（黄喋）十里長亭十杯酒（游泳）　　玫瑰團　　華興（一二六○）下午五時三刻至六時半　　雨打芭蕉（前奏）小鸚哥（玲玲張如）漁光曲（曼麗）娘子軍（雯仙）山中美人（吳芳桃李爭春（張如）蘇三不要哭（曼麗）蝴蝶姑娘（雯仙吳芳）　　敦本（八○○）下午七時至八時　　喬治進行曲（前奏）醉臥沙塲（張如）春潮曲（王蝶）努力（曼麗）後臺（吳芳）紅顔軍士（張如）春朝曲（雯仙）等一等吧（曼麗）燕雙飛（朱琪）　　明遠（九六○）下午八時至九時　　昭君怨（前奏）說愛就愛（張如曼麗）貴妃醉酒（雯仙周恭）落花流水（朱琪吳芳）從軍别愛（張如）蝶戀花（玲玲）賣油條（曼麗）我願意（吳芳）　　中西（一○四○）下午八時三刻至九時半　　雙飛蛺蝶（前奏）勇士凱歌（玲玲）名利網（曼麗）麗華我决不忘了你（張如）安慰（吳芳）漁村之歌（朱琪）舟中曲（雯仙）Ｗｈｉｓｌｉｎｇ　ｉｎ　ｄａｒｋ（後奏）　　安定（八六○）下午十時至十一時　　楊翠喜（前奏）甜蜜的夢（雯仙）再見故鄉（曼麗）摩登戀愛（張如）擱樓上小姐（吳芳）春朝曲（雯仙）我要你一切（曼麗）月圓時節（張如）小親親（吳芳）　　都會社　　李樹德堂（九四○）下午六時至七時　　園裏園外（姚莉）夜深深（薛硯）節儉歌（儷亞）永遠在後臺（芝亞）舟中曲（薛硯）吹泡泡（姚莉）　　李樹德堂（九四○）下午八時至九時　　瑪琍若是你願意（姚莉）擱樓上的小姐（薛硯）雙雙蝴蝶（星韻）農村之歌（若蕙）小小茉莉（珍妮）雙料情人（薛硯）漁光曲（姚莉）　　上海無綫電劇社　　華東（一三六○）下午八時至九時　　春又來（曼娜）可憐的秋香（英茵）寒衣曲（新華社嚴斐）飛花歌（倉隱秋）永遠在後臺（曼娜）特别快車（英茵）摩登戀愛（新華社嚴斐）璇宮艷史（倉隱秋）　　夜鶯藝社　　國華（一二○○）下午九時至十時　　姊妹花（曼娜）晚香玉（魚華）愛的花（曼娜）夜來香（蘭蕾）人間仙子（雪琴）芭蕉葉上詩（魚華）賣花女（蘭蕾）故事　　顧醒愚聊齋　　新聲（一三八○）下午十時至十一時彈詞　　姚小庵珍珠塔　　中西（一○四○）上午十時至十一時　　開篇［掃秦］　　休笑俺瘋痴垢面形。地藏王有意落凡塵。借身打坐靈隱寺。壁上題詩爲掃秦。拈香來了當朝相。三炷靑香手内擎。低頭默默暗通神。但愿風調和雨順。惟求夫婦得長春。保佑岳家賢父子。往昇仙界早超生。抬頭猛見留詩句。奸雄戰凛頓然驚。此詩乃與夫人作。事發東窗烈火生。立時怒向喚瘋僧。那曉他口吐禪機多變化。呼風喚雨盡皆能。手執火筒通外國。還拿棕帚掃奸臣。風波只爲專權起。含寃屈死冷泉亭。歸家夫婦同商議。削髮皈依卸利名。聽信了纔言長舌婦。受盡了　都地獄刑。到如今渾身鐵鑄岳王墳。　　兪筱霞兪筱雲玉蜻蜓　　新聲（一三八○）下午六時至七時　　開篇［長生殿七夕］　　玉樓天半起笙歌曲避曼離宮樂事多，却巧良宵逢七夕，風流天子惹情魔，暇來駕辛長生殿，私約眞妃拜素娥一灣新月明如水，萬片秋雲薄似羅，暗想雙星天上事，鵲橋有路渡銀河，嘆人生客易紅顔換，百歲先陰等若梭，不如預訂三生約，願他年琴瑟莫蹉跎，在天願用雙飛翼，在地當爲連理枝祝罷一番宮樓轉，金釵鈿盒沐恩波，水昌簾捲近秋河，話劇　　上海無綫電劇社　　永生（一○八○）下午四時半至五時半　　［落霞孤鶩］　　熱血沸騰的江秋鶩，他爲了要救祖國，救民衆，就冒險加入革命黨，擔担各項秘密工作，因而引起了當局的注意，預備把抓進警廳，處以死刑。傷痕未愈的落霞，得到這個消息之後，就瞞着主人，偷偷地去求仁中學，引江秋鶩來馮姥姥家，密告軍警暗捕革命黨事，因此，江秋鶩才能脫離虎口。　　觀音社　　中西（一○四○）下午七時一至八時　　［兒女英雄傳］　　離别了，鄧九公這老粗兒，本來魔，他是個草莽英雄，怎樣能够在這繁華的京城裏住呢？他只能走，從此後他們有知道要在那一個年月才能會面呢？　　中華（二四○）下午八時一刻至九時　　［歡喜寃家］　　每一個靑年總覺得老人的話是討厭的，嚴端甫這老東西，他意看不起咱們的白白桂英老板，這不是太討厭了嗎？　　李樹德堂（九四○）下午九時至十時　　［落霞孤鶩］　　華美（一○六○）下午十時至十一時　　［滿江紅］　　李桃枝和萬行長，供主任，柏正修吃完飯，一同又到六朝居來棒塲，萬行長出洋一百元，點桃枝一百個戲，六朝居的老板，見着花花綠綠這一捲鈔票，簡直把他喜歡得要瘋了，拿着鈔票不知道怎樣好，所以在後台鬧出很多笑話。桃枝唱完戲，萬行長他們追到桃枝家中。　　眞是：［酒不醉人，人自醉，色不迷人，人自迷。］國學　　汪冰梅女士唐詩　　華興（一二六○）上午九時至十時　　兵車行　　　　　　　　杜甫　　車轔轔　馬蕭蕭　　　　行人弓箭各在腰　　耶孃妻子走相送　　　　塵埃不見咸陽橋　　牽衣頓足攔道哭　　　　哭聲直上干雲宵　　道旁過者問行人　　　　行人但云點行頻　　或從十五北防河　　　　便至四十西營田　　去時里正與裹頭　　　　歸來頭白還戍邊　　邊庭流血成海水　　　　武皇開邊意未已　　君不聞漢家山東二百州　千村萬落生荆杞　　縱有健婦把鋤犁　　　　禾生隴畝無東西　　况復秦兵耐苦戰　　　　被驅不異犬與鷄　　長者雖有恨　　　　　　役夫敢申恨　　且如今年多　　　　　　未休關西率　　縣官急索租　　　　　　租稅從何出　　信知生男惡　　　　　　反是生女好　　生女猶得嫁比鄰　　　　生男埋沒葬百草　　君不見靑海頭　　　　　古來白骨無人收　　新鬼煩慮舊鬼器　　　　天陰雨濕聲啾啾</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊　電影專刊好萊塢不景氣聲中  素華　　歐洲銀星曁名導演受聘福斯　　值得注意的却爾鮑育和依力　　不景氣的濃霧，是無可諱言的籠罩着全球了丨窮極奢華的好萊塢。亦感覺到極度的不安。規模較小，資本較不充足的製片公司，就不得不停下來不幹。而那些資本雄偉，基礎堅固的著名影片公司如米高梅，派拉蒙，雷電華，福斯等，雖然不致怎樣的鬧［經濟恐慌］；但是現在他們對於每一張片子的支出，是都要小心翼翼地打算一下。　　在這種經濟緊縮形勢之下，福斯公司竟不惜犧牲重金，聘請了歐洲的一顆紅星丨丨却爾鮑育，和著名導演丨丨依力察爾到好萊塢裏來加入他們的陣綫。這不是很可注意的事嗎？　　我們要知道福斯公司爲什麽要不惜重資去聘請這兩位藝人之先，我應該將他們作一個簡略的介紹給讀者。　　對於却爾鮑育，恐怕我們有大多數的人還是覺得很生疏吧。這就是因爲他在歐洲主演的片子難得到上海來的緣故。他在歐洲是一位舞台上的紅人兒，也是銀幕上一位亮晶晶的燦爛明星。現在福斯公司請他來好萊塢，頭一次給他主演的片子，就是福斯公司用去百萬美金製成的音樂巨片［琴挑］（聞此片將在本埠公映）。　　的確，却爾鮑育有很多值得人們欽慕的地方。他曾受過很好的敎育。他已經結了婚，（就是大上海開映的［相思曲］裏的女主角柏德潘德蓀）。他有的是詩人般的温淸，鬭拳家般的健美體格。待人接物。是和靄而有禮，從來都沒有表示過不高興的樣子。他那一雙半開半合的眸子裏，充份地表現着他心坎中的熱情。很有趣的，他面孔的輪廓竟是很像［著名笑匠］卓别麟，而他的舉動也有和卓别麟相像的地方呢。　　他生來就有很堅决的性情。他立意要做的東西，他就非把它幹好不可，設有一些的孤疑。他最近在攝製［琴挑］之前，立意要特别練習兩個月的英語。現在他發音的正確，間直是出乎他自己意料之外。他唯一的嗜好就是很喜歡吸紙烟。戸外運動也是他最歡喜的。滑冰可說是他的拿手好戲了。他滑冰的技術，恐怕在好萊塢能够比得上他的，還沒有幾個。　　著名導演依力察爾，這恐怕大家都知道的吧。舉世讚美的［龍翔鳳舞］，就是他的出品。用音樂來作背景，用音樂來調和劇中的空氣；這都是他的特長技術，也是他作品的成功。他這次一來好萊塢，就導演福斯的百萬金巨片［琴挑］，福斯公司的犧牲巨量金錢，我們相信一定會得着相當的效果。　　問題又覆過來，現在我們要明白電影是一種高尙的，有意識的娛樂。它能够供給人們的知識，經騐，安慰人們的心靈，可使人們忘却一時的苦惱。所以雖然是在不景氣的聲浪包圍中，而高尙的，有益身心的娛樂，是仍然需要的；換一句話說，就是負着努力於第八種藝術底使命的人們，在全球都陷於愁雲慘霧中的當兒，就更應盡量地供給世人們一些愉快，使人們的生活，不至一直的枯燥下去。大槪福斯公司這次的不惜犧牲去聘請這兩位藝人來，就是本着這個意旨吧。影片談評評［女犯］丨丨金城  凌鶴　　無論如何，這一影片是我們應當和作者竭誠商榷的，因爲從内容以至於形式，［女犯］並不是一部成功的作品。　　首先我們得說，作者狹隘的復仇觀念，不免使這一影片陷於陳舊的泥坑裏。自然，其所以沒有成功的主要原因，便是劇作，不能在作品中抓住現實根據，只是幻想和虚構。於是當我們看這影片的時候，祇覺得是在聽一段和我們日常生活不相關聯的故事，當然它是不能引起我們眞實情感的了。　　我們雖不敢說［女犯］是［市儈思想］的反應，但是劇作者觀念的陳舊，確是不可否認的。很明白的，他以逢迎權勢的手段，構成了所謂［革命］的故事。但是這種［革命］的解釋，無論如何是很可笑的。譬如說那一個所謂［革命家］的女兒，是不是所謂革命的呢？不是的，她根本不懂得什麽國家大事，她只曉得殺父之仇，不可不報，而劇作者却在最後說她是爲國除害。這無論如何是沒有理由的牽强附會。至於說到個人的復仇觀念，更是用不着解釋的了。　　在劇作者方面，也許他以爲仇人就是丈夫的父親，爲了復仇而殺公公，乃是相當戲劇的，可是在我們看來，與其說是戲劇性的把握，毋寗說是不通的巧合。事實上在這裏劇作者不要她和一賣油條的兒子結婚，而要她和一大少爺結合，正表現了他觀念的陳舊。而且一個大少爺會和一流浪少女結婚，也不是現實的典型。至於做兒子的不知道父親的眞姓名，而眞名字刺在手上，兒子竟從未發現，也是使人不敢置信的。　　再說罷，復仇的塲合，旣然是劇作者認爲精采之處，我們姑且不論它是否正確的表現，劇作者將它作爲全劇的高潮，乃是毫無疑問的，可是結果導演却是以極迂緩的調子，再加上將時間不必要的延長，結果不僅是毫無緊張的空氣，而且使人們感覺難耐的沉悶。其非電影手法的表現，也就可想而知了。　　我們再看導演是怎樣描畫劇中人之性格的，這可以就女主角身上作代表的說明。假使要她擔當復仇的重任，那末她應當是有着英雄的姿態，可是在畫面上所表現出來的，她不但是沒有英雄的氣槪，而且竟是一個十分平庸的女子。此外，演技的不成功，我們也不必細說了。曼麗黛泰利買鑰匙  東林　　丨難道是得到愛人了麽？丨　　近來因爲曼麗黛泰利時常到五金店去買鑰匙，所以好萊塢的人們，都用好奇的眼光看着她了。　　你們可知道這是什麽道理麽？原來在好萊塢，假使一個女人，把鑰匙送給男人，意思就是［我的一切都可以讓你［自由］了。］爲了這緣故，人們看見曼麗在那裏買鑰匙，就都以爲她一定得到了愛人了。　　可是奇怪的是，只見黛泰利老是買着鑰匙，而從來不曾看見那［所謂的愛人］的影子。於是人們又不得不懷疑起來了。　　有一位朋友終於忍耐不住了，有一天看見黛泰利立刻就問道：［你到底爲什麽常是買鑰匙？］　　曼麗聽了朋友的話，微笑着答道：［你可知道我的女兒瑪麗亞，她眞頑皮得很，當我不在家的時候，她總是把鑰匙拿到不知道那裏去了，因此我老是要配鑰匙呀！］　　這悶胡蘆終於打破了！首都防空演習藝華攝成影片  藝　　當上月二十五日，首都舉行防空大演習的時候，藝華公司爲喚起國人對於空防的注意，乃遣派大批人馬前往攝製新聞影片，計是行有［飛花村］導演鄭應時，［人之初］導演史東山，［犧牲者］導演袁叢美，以及攝影師周克，汪洋，攝影助手童本奎，韓仲良等。史東山同周克專攝飛機戰鬥並角逐，鄭應時跟童本奎則專攝高射砲隊，警備隊，消防隊等之活躍，至袁叢美及汪洋則專攝街上治安及障礙物之工作。東奔西走，不遺餘力。時而同乘飛機，拍攝空中戰况，時而附隨消防隊後，拍攝救災情形，時而又往來於高射砲隊及探照燈隊之間，拍攝高射砲實况。故回來時，無一個不疲倦如軟綿，可是他們的收穫，委實不少哩。蘇俄偉搆［狂風暴雨］今日公映　　［狂風暴雨］爲蘇俄蘇基影片公司一九三四年超特鉅製，由蘇俄著名女明星塔拉沙華主演。内容叙述一個孤女於出嫁時，因無巨大妝奩，致遭夫家白眼，中經種種波折，終乃投河而死。劇情哀感頑艷，可歌可泣。其對於人生之矛盾與人類之自私，可謂揭發無餘。按本片之原著者，即係世界聞名之劇作者奥斯托洛夫斯基。奥氏擅長於描寫舊俄時代社會生活之黑暗面。本劇乃其平生得意之作。前在歐洲曾經迭次上演，最近乃由蘇俄攝成影片。在蘇俄放映之日，萬人空巷，盛極一時，其價值可以想見。現該片業已决定於本月五日起，在本埠巴黎大戲院公映。天一從業員動靜錄  白芸　　范雪朋文逸民夫婦日前赴家興省親，一週後始能歸來。　　洪濟已由港來申。　　高天棲今日返紹興原籍，五日後即可返申。　　强榮華將與某公司新人訂婚之說。　　關宏達近日努力練習鐵餅，鉛球。　　高梨痕正忙早日完成［模範靑年］。　　蔡耐麗未天紅每日均在學唱平劇。電影小說母女緣（Lady　by　Cholce）（三）  仲嘉　　潘茜聽了庭長呼喝她的話，心裏嚇了一跳，心想庭長一向很和氣的，這回怎麽這樣嚴厲起來。祗聽見庭長對著那逮捕她的巡警道：［將她押下去，暫時我再考慮一下。第二件案子！］他喊到第二個案子的時候，聲音格外響些。亞拉班看著潘茜一顚一躓跟著那個警察出去，未免覺得心神沮喪。並且第二個案子，就是她的。她本來是聽了她經理肯道爾的話，呌警察來將她提起來，藉以轟動輿論作爲宣傳的。但是她現在有些害怕起來了。她覺得法庭不是好玩的，這次恐怕上了肯道爾的當了。一回兒到了她上庭的時候，她愈加害怕起來，因爲她所料想的果然不差。她的懇求，一齊好像風吹馬耳，聽不進去，雖然照她的理想，美術院裏的石像，下體祗蓋著一張無花果的葉子，而她身上還蓋著那麽大一把鴕羽扇子哩。不想庭長竟長篇大論的斥責她起來。她還强辯著道：［我的羽扇舞，並沒有什麽不好呀。我現在就可以舞給你看一下。不過你要自忆去設想一切的燈光和音樂的………］她說著就輕舒皓腕，將寛鬆的皮大衣解了開來。庭長一看，嚇了一跳，雖然他祇看到一體雪白粉嫩的肩膀。他立即拿著鎯頭，敲著公案喝道：［不許跳！亭是夜中法庭，不是夜總會！我現在判决你在黑井島上監禁一年，罰金一百元！］他說完了，看見那女郎的臉上，突然表現出無限的驚慌和悲苦。他們想他未免心腸過硬了。或者也許是潘茜的案子，使了這樣憤怒的。因爲他的仁慈，並沒有都到潘茜的忙，要是現在亞拉班第一次被逮，而不嚴重地處治她一下，她將來亦會變成潘茜第二的。那末他的嚴厲是對的，可是他再看着亞拉班的臉，他又覺得不忍起來，因爲她臉上是充滿著一種不可想　的愁苦，嘴唇顫動著，眼睛裏含着兩包眼涙，並且那副小孩子的面孔，是夜半法庭裏所看不到的。這樣他就覺得，或者他嚴厲過份了。於是他不由自主似的繼續著說道：［但是，因爲你到我面前，還是第一次，我可以宣佈緩刑。下次不准再犯。倘使你再裸體跳舞，無論有羽扇沒有羽扇，總之是破壞這個城市的安寗和道德，我就要立即將前判執行的。第二個案子！］這樣，他就將亞拉班經輕打發了。等到他審完了幾件别的案子，退到休息室的時候，他已經神疲力竭了。他看見潘茜還在那裏等著，並且字紙簏裏還有一隻空酒瓶，每次潘茜到此，都是這樣的。他起初心裏很不高興，但是不久他又覺得要諒解她的。他並且可憐她，到了這個時候，不得不用强烈的酒，來温暖她的心，維持她的精神。他於是吩咐庭丁道：［趕快去呌莊尼密爾斯來！］潘茜聽了，不覺身子又矮了半截。她原來是希望，這最近的案子，不讓莊尼知道的。莊尼在幾年前，受了他父親的遺命來尋她，並且照顧她。那是他父親在將死之前，最後叮囑他的話。莊尼聽了他父親的話，居然將她尋到了，但是他却沒有法子，可以照顧她。（未完）上海郵政管理局封發郵件時刻表　　上海各支局皆可寄遞掛號快信航空郵件及辦理滙兌儲金等事務　　寄住處所　　　　　　　　　　舟車名目　　　日期　　　　　平常信件發封　　　　長江各埠　　　　　　　　　　火車輪船　　　每日　　　　　　十三點及廿一點卅　　北洋各埠（除左列各埠）　　　火車　　　　　每日　　　　　　六·十四·半及廿一·半威海衛煙台　　　　　　　　　　　新豐　　　　　五日　　　　　　廿二點南滿鐵路區域及關東租借地（經　公司郵船　　　七日　　　　　　七點十五由大連）　　南洋各埠　　　　　　　　　　　　鄞縣（寗波）　　　　　　　　新寗紹或新江天每日（除星期日）十　點四十五　　永嘉（温州）　　　　　　　　遇順　　　　　五日　　　　　　八點　　閩候（福州）　　　　　　　　靑浦　　　　　六日　　　　　　八點思明（厦門）香港廣東　　　　　　太原　　　　　五日　　　　　　廿二點汕頭香港廣東　　　　　　　　　　和生　　　　　五日　　　　　　八點香港廣東（輕件）　　　　　　　　公司郵船　　　五日　　　　　　十七點　　國外各埠小呂宋澳洲及紐絲倫　　　　　　　公司郵船　　　五日　　　　　　十七點香港南洋羣島蘇彝士及歐洲　　　　公司郵船　　　十日　　　　　　廿一點日本坎拿大美洲及歐洲　　　　　　公司郵船　　　十日　　　　　　廿一點日本檀香山美洲及歐洲　　　　　　公司郵船　　　十日　　　　　　廿一點德國及亨堡轉（僅封保險郵件及　公司郵船　　　六日　　　　　　廿點註明該船之郵件）日本高麗各埠　　　　　　　　　　公司郵船　　　八日　　　　　　七點十五台灣　　　　　　　　　　　　　　公司郵船　　　八日　　　　　　七點十五蘇俄（亞洲部份）經由海參威　　航空郵件滬平線（東海靑島天津北平等埠）　中國航空公司　每星期二四六　　五點滬蓉線（南京懷寗九江漢口沙市　同上　　　　　每日　　　　　　五點卅分宜昌萬縣巴縣成都等埠）　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　五點滬粤線（永嘉閩候思明汕頭廣州）　同上

<h3 id="e1">Representative Luo Submits Memorandum Requesting Reduction of Annuity <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>China's Economy Faces Difficulties, Annuity Burden Too Heavy</p>
<p>Northeast Lost, Income Decreased, Making it Increasingly Difficult to Cope</p>
<h3 id="e2">Finance Committee to Discuss the Case <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) Luo Zhongyi, Chinese Minister to Denmark, after attending the UN General Assembly, remained in Geneva to address the issue of the Chinese government's payment of annuities to the League of Nations. Today, Mr. Luo submitted a memorandum to the Secretary regarding the annuity issue, making statements and suggestions. The full text is roughly divided into six sections. The first section is an introduction, stating that the purpose of this memorandum is to extend the declaration made by the Chinese delegation to the Fourth Committee of the 15th Assembly, and substantiate it with various figures and data. Other detailed points will be telegraphed to me by the Chinese government this month and will be successively submitted to the Secretariat as attachments. The second section is a historical background, stating that during the period of the former Beijing government, the proportion of annuities paid by China was too high, and payments were often not made on time. After the establishment of the National Government, it agreed in 1930 to divide the arrears into ten installments, paying an annual amount of 480,000 Swiss francs. However, it also requested that future annuity payments be reduced by half. Only the General Assembly has the authority to approve increases or decreases in member states' annuities. However, the Chinese government's intention is that if the annuity can be reduced by half after the arrears are cleared, it would be appropriate before the exact amount of the annuity is determined. Chinese representatives have repeatedly raised this matter in 1931 and 1932, but the League of Nations insisted that it should only be discussed from 1934 onwards. The third section states that the annuity borne by the Chinese government is indeed too heavy. This is the most important reason for requesting a reduction. The annuity amount was determined at a time of economic prosperity, flourishing trade, and high prices. The value of Chinese currency was also much higher than it is now. The situation is now different. If China has to continue to bear this amount, it will reach 3% of the total national expenditure. Compared with European countries where this burden only accounts for 0.01% or 0.03% of the total national expenditure, the difference is incalculable. The fourth section states that since the loss of the four northeastern provinces, China's income has greatly decreased. Direct tax revenues from postal services, telecommunications, railways, aviation, and international trade have all been severely affected, making it even more difficult. The fifth section describes the major disasters suffered by China in the past four years, which have had a profound and growing impact on the people's livelihood and national income. Other member states are often granted special permission to reduce annuities when they encounter disasters. China can also cite this precedent and request a reduction. The sixth section argues that some believe that if China reduces its annuity, international technical cooperation will be affected. However, the League of Nations budget was being discussed when China's request for a reduction in the annuity was being negotiated. Other countries, such as Greece, also receive benefits from League of Nations technical cooperation through special donations. Currently, China is affected by the global economic downturn and suffers from both natural and man-made disasters. The financial situation is extremely difficult and there is no sign of recovery. The standard of living is low, and even a very small amount is urgently needed. Representative Luo's memorandum will be discussed at the Finance Committee meeting on the 12th of this month.

<p>丨Radio Speech Last Night丨</p>
<p>Hopes to Eradicate Opium to Revive the Nation</p>
<p>(Geneva) Mr. Branko, Director of the Narcotics Intelligence Bureau, gave a radio speech tonight, clarifying the work of the Opium Advisory Committee. He stated that one of the most important cases in this meeting is the new anti-drug program of the Chinese government. Mr. Branko said that the Chinese government faces many difficulties in effectively eradicating drugs, but the new program and regulations are comprehensive. If they can be implemented effectively, opium and other drugs can be eradicated within six years. Mr. Branko also said that the losses suffered by China due to the people's opium consumption are almost incalculable, and the illegal profits obtained by drug traffickers are also extremely alarming. During these six years, if the Chinese government implements a monopoly plan, the income will be substantial, but it will become a kind of temptation to continue the monopoly after the deadline. Mr. Branko expressed his respect for Chairman Chiang's determination to ban opium, saying that Chiang bears extremely heavy responsibilities, and hopes that his plan will succeed in eradicating opium and other narcotics within six years, so that the Chinese people can be saved from the scourge of drugs, the nation can become stronger, and the future of unification can be relied upon. Criticism of China's new plan is not yet timely, and it is necessary to wait for a year to observe its effectiveness before making a decision. (Central News Agency dispatch, 3rd)</p>

All county administrations should strive to reduce burdens before the end of the year. Regardless of how insufficient the central government's subsidies are, the accounts must be closed by the end of the year. If local projects cannot be further reduced and require funding, the provincial treasury will subsidize them. (Special dispatch, 4th)</p>

<p>The Hebei Provincial Government Resolves to Maintain the Original Boundaries</p>
<p>Representatives of Daxing and Wanping Petition the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan telegraphed the Hebei Provincial Government to send personnel to Nanjing to discuss the issue of border demarcation between Hebei Province and Peiping City with the relevant departments of the Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Finance, and Peiping Mayor Yuan Liang. (Special dispatch, 4th) The representatives of the people of Daxing and Wanping counties, Gao Dengrong and others, came to Nanjing to petition regarding the issue of border demarcation between Hebei and Peiping. On the afternoon of the 4th, they took the petition to see President Wang and requested that the two counties not be included in Peiping City. Chen Xian received them on Wang's behalf and promised to convey the message to Wang before scheduling another meeting. (Special dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The representatives of the people of Daxing and Wanping counties telegraphed the province to oppose the expansion of Peiping City's boundaries (details omitted). The fact that the people of the two counties oppose the border demarcation of Peiping City has been reported by representative Wang Shenguan and others. It is now found that today's newspaper reported that Deng Yinzhou and others from the business and academic circles of Wanping County declared their support for the border demarcation of Peiping City, which is definitely not true. We still request that the old boundaries be maintained in order to comply with public opinion. We hereby report this (details omitted). (Special dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Hebei Provincial Government convened a routine meeting today, which was attended by all the new provincial committee members. A resolution was passed on the border demarcation case of Peiping City: 1. The provincial and municipal boundaries should still be based on the original areas in principle. 2. Regarding the public utilities in the areas adjacent to the counties within the province that are related to the city, management and protection measures should be agreed upon during the border demarcation. (Special dispatch, 4th) After the news spread that Deng Xianzhu and other representatives of the gentry of Wanping and Changping had expressed their support for the expansion of the urban area in the Hebei-Peiping border demarcation issue, the gentry from Qinghe Town in Changping conducted an investigation and found that Deng and others were using false names. They specially appointed Meng Xianya, Jiang Baolin, and Wang Yushan as representatives, who arrived in Peiping this morning and went to Fengtai to report. The anti-demarcation delegation of Daxing and Wanping immediately telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Hebei Provincial Government to report the reasons for opposing Deng and others' use of false names to support the expansion of the urban area. The first batch of representatives from Daxing and Wanping who went to Nanjing to appeal, including Wang Dianjia, have arrived in Nanjing. The second batch of representatives, including Li Yafeng and over twenty others, are scheduled to go to Tianjin on the 5th to petition the provincial government. The third batch of representatives, including Shi Xiangru, are also scheduled to go to Nanjing to petition within the next few days. (Special dispatch, 4th)</p>

<h3 id="e24">What is Expected of the Academic Work Advisory Center  季 <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>The Academic Work Advisory Center is jointly established by the National Economic Council and the Ministry of Education. Since its establishment, it has sought to connect with vocational introduction agencies in various regions to enhance the effectiveness of assisting unemployed youth. The Advisory Center has formulated liaison measures, including the [Survey Form for Graduates of Colleges and Above] and the [Work Advisory Registration Certificate], which have been sent to the graduate affairs departments of various universities for review and implementation as a preliminary form of connection. Today, young people who have received higher education are struggling to find employment. The intention behind this initiative is undoubtedly beyond reproach. However, there are still things we feel compelled to express, and we would like to present them.</p>
<p>Today, the competition for jobs in our society is becoming increasingly fierce. Any vacancies in relatively prestigious positions are quickly seized by those who are skilled at maneuvering. The infighting and conflicts that arise from the struggle for positions are commonplace and no longer surprising. Even if the Advisory Center has good intentions for introductions, it may find there is little demand. Observe the public and private institutions everywhere; each time they recruit personnel, they invariably rely on referrals from relatives and friends, and recommendations are often made by powerful individuals. Those who rely on public introduction agencies can be said to be few and far between, and if there are any, they are likely positions that ordinary people despise and are unwilling to take. The government established the examination system for the purpose of selecting talented individuals. However, in the past two national higher examinations, only one or two hundred people were admitted. Even with the government's position, arranging positions for them is still deeply challenging, let alone for others. It is said that among these one or two hundred people, less than half can obtain official positions, and many still rely on personal connections. It can be seen that finding a job is difficult, and helping others to succeed is equally challenging.</p>
<p>Now that the Academic Work Advisory Center seeks to connect with vocational introduction agencies in various regions, we cannot but acknowledge its ambition to [gather wisdom and broaden ideas] and [facilitate cooperation and simplify tasks]. However, to say that this initiative alone can increase employment opportunities and directly benefit relief efforts is probably not necessarily true. However, the responsibility in this regard does not lie with the Advisory Center. The deep-rooted departmentalism in various places, the decline of production industries, and the inadequacy of past educational policies are all factors contributing to the unemployment phenomenon. To seek fundamental remedies, it is necessary to awaken those in power nationwide who have the right to employ people, and to improve education, production, and other industries. However, this matter is of great importance and cannot be achieved overnight. During this transitional period, we can only seek secondary solutions. Therefore, we dare to make two requests: (1) The Advisory Center is organized by the National Economic Council and the Ministry of Education, and its purpose is to assist in relieving youth unemployment through introduction. Why not first request its governing bodies (i.e., the Economic Council and the Ministry of Education) to directly place talented unemployed youth, to the best of their ability, as an example for other institutions? (2) The Advisory Center should increase personnel and expand activities. In addition to communicating with various vocational introduction agencies, it should also maintain close contact with important institutions within and outside Beijing that have direct hiring authority, in preparation for future introductions when vacancies arise. The effectiveness of this may be limited, but we hope that those in power in various institutions will gradually learn to identify and promote true talent and not be surrounded by relatives, friends, and powerful individuals. At that time, instead of each institution searching for candidates on its own and feeling disappointed or discouraged, it would be better to have a government agency representative to screen them.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Min Bandit Areas Fully Recovered After Capturing Ninghua <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>◎Longyan: The Eastern Route Army captured Ninghua, uncovered the pseudo-Jiangxi Soviet organs hiding in the area, and captured many key bandit personnel. Only Ninghua County remained in the Min bandit area, and now it has been captured. The bandit areas of Fujian Province have been completely recovered. (Central News Agency dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) The 52nd Division captured Ninghua County on the 1st and advanced on the 3rd. Hundreds of remnants of the Sha bandits' pseudo 7th Army Corps' Young and Strong Brigade resisted stubbornly in dangerous terrain. They were defeated on the 2nd. Currently, only the Chenkeng-Hutou area of the county still has scattered bandits. Lu Shi has dispatched teams to search and eliminate them within a set time. The Executive Yuan appointed Liu Yigong as the Special Commissioner for Bandit Suppression Supervision on the Border of Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi. Wei Lihuang telegraphed that the bandit gang of Liang Yubao, who were harassing the Song-Zheng border, had been defeated by teams dispatched by Liu Heding's army. There is no trace of bandits near Zhengdun on the Song-Zheng border. (Special dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(London) The failure of the Chinese Jiangxi Communist Party has attracted considerable attention from various countries. The Manchester Guardian believes that the resistance of the Chinese Communist Party is gradually decreasing and expresses satisfaction. It states that since the Communist Party has failed, the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, Chiang Kai-shek, will propose various measures to seek national unification at the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, without the need to resolve internal affairs by force. Furthermore, the last base of the Red bandits in Fujian Province, Qingliu County, was captured by the National Army on November 27th. At the same time, the Red bandits are retreating steadily, and the National Army is reporting frequent victories. Chairman Chiang has ordered the complete clearing of the front lines and the disbanding of the Southwest and Northwest Bandit Suppression Headquarters. Although this news should be treated with caution as usual, it is believable that the resistance of the Red bandits has been destroyed. The newspaper continues that the Communist Party has occupied Jiangxi for several years and has been the greatest obstacle to China's peace and unification. Now that the National Army has directly attacked the bandit nest, the so-called "Red Country" has been eliminated, which is deeply gratifying. The Chinese authorities have continuously issued declarations on peaceful unification, and it is hoped that this time, it will produce good results. (Havas dispatch, 3rd)</p>

<p>(Nanchang) After the establishment of the Pacification Headquarters in Jiangxi and Fujian, Jiangxi was divided into eight pacification zones, and Fujian was divided into four pacification zones. The Executive Yuan recently stipulated the powers and duties of the commanders of each pacification zone. In addition to the designated National Army being under their command, all security teams, administrative supervisors, county magistrates, and political directors of special districts within their jurisdiction are under their dispatch and command.

Once the regiments are established, one-third of the original security teams in each county throughout the province will be drawn for the first term of conscription this year. The conscription numbers for the first, second, and third terms have also been stipulated. (Central News Agency dispatch, 4th) (Fuzhou) Chiang Ting-wen returned to Longyan at noon on the 3rd and went to Zhangzhou to organize the Pacification Headquarters. The location of the four pacification zone commanders will be determined within days. (Central News Agency dispatch, 4th)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) Provincial news: Bai Chongxi telegraphed Guangdong on the evening of the 3rd, reporting a victory, stating that the bandit rebels who invaded Guangxi have now been completely defeated. In a series of fierce battles over five days, more than 1,000 bandits were killed, over 2,000 guns were seized, and over 2,000 prisoners were captured. Among them, more than 500 Guangxi bandits originally belonged to Li Mingrui's troops and have been sent to the province for reform. The rest are mostly from Hunan and Jiangxi and are now being sent to the central government for disposal. (Central News Agency dispatch, 4th)</p>

<p>(Hangzhou) The remnants of the Red bandit Fang Zhimin, who recently fled into Zhejiang, have, after the military authorities quickly dispatched a large army to encircle and suppress them, fled into Anhui Province as of the 4th. Local order has been completely restored. Yu Jishi returned to the province at 5:00 PM today. According to him, the bandits passing through Zhejiang were all in remote villages and towns and did not dare to attack county seats. The bandits in Wanshoufang have already been routed. On the evening of the 3rd, more than 3,000 bandits engaged our army in a fierce battle overnight in Baiguozhuang, Changhua County. The bandits suffered hundreds of casualties and were defeated by our army this morning. By this afternoon, they had completely fled to Jixi, Anhui Province. There are no longer any bandits in Zhejiang. (Special dispatch, 4th)</p>

<p>(Jinan) Recently, due to unscrupulous merchants smuggling silver dollars to Dalian, banks in the city are preparing cash to prevent bank runs. Currently, 3 to 4 million yuan in cash has been transferred from Shanghai, and withdrawals are being made from various silver firms, leading to a severe credit crunch. Shanghai drafts are down 18 yuan per thousand, and Shanghai remittances are down 13 yuan. Interest rates for two-month loans have risen to 1.75%. Because banks are not lending, there is little cash in the market. Transactions of major commodities such as cotton, cotton yarn, raw rice, and food have sharply decreased.

<h3 id="e31">Transaction Tax Expected to be Levied Next Spring <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance's draft for levying transaction taxes is still under review by the commercial law and finance groups of the Legislative Yuan. It is understood that this tax is different from the exchange tax. The exchange tax is a purely profitable nature and has been levied for some time. The transaction tax is levied on both buyers and sellers in the market, similar to a business tax. For example, once a transaction is completed, both parties should bear the statutory tax amount equally, just like the commission paid by both parties to the broker. However, for the broker, it becomes a customary handling fee, while this is a legitimate state tax, specifically levied on both parties, with similar circumstances. As for the tax rate standards, public bonds will be based on a unit of 10,000 yuan, bullion will be based on each tael, and other items such as goods, securities, cotton yarn, flour, miscellaneous grains, and oils will be calculated by package, carload (for grains), or catty (for oils). For example, public bonds will be taxed at approximately 1.5 yuan per 10,000 yuan, bullion will be taxed at approximately 0.1 yuan per tael, and cotton yarn will be taxed at approximately 3 yuan per package. After the tax is levied, it is expected to generate 3 to 4 million yuan in tax revenue annually. The collection procedures will be handled by the respective exchanges. However, because it still needs to be passed by the Legislative Yuan and undergo promulgation procedures, it is expected that it can only be levied in the spring of next year.

<p>Kato Questions the Manchuria Issue at the Japanese Budget Committee</p>
<p>Okada, Hirota, and Hayashi Respond Separately</p>
<p>Extraordinary Diet Session Decides to Extend for Three Days</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The House of Representatives Budget Committee convened at 10:00 AM today to continue questioning. The first questioner today was Kato Kumejiro. Kato raised questions regarding policies towards Manchuria and the issue of agencies in Manchuria. He emphasized the contradiction of the Commander of the Kwantung Army concurrently serving as the Plenipotentiary Ambassador, and the necessity of revising and strengthening the Japan-Manchukuo Protocol, attracting everyone's attention. The content of Kato's discussion with the various ministers is as follows:</p>
<p>Kato asked: When the government implemented reforms to the administrative organs stationed in Manchuria, were there instances of disrupting official discipline? Does the government intend to punish those responsible?</p>
<p>Prime Minister Okada replied: It is regrettable that different opinions were raised from various sides before the decision to reform the agencies stationed in Manchuria.</p>
<p>Kato asked: How is the bandit suppression in Manchuria progressing?</p>
<p>Minister of the Army Hayashi replied: There are currently small bandit groups scattered throughout Manchuria, numbering approximately 30,000 to 40,000. The Japanese army is continuing to suppress them.</p>
<p>Kato asked: What is the command system between the Ambassador stationed in Manchuria and the Commander of the Kwantung Army?</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Hirota replied: They are currently on an equal footing.</p>
<p>Kato asked: Is this reform of the agencies stationed in Manchuria a temporary reform?</p>
<p>Prime Minister Okada replied: In the future, as the security of [Manchukuo] is improved, the organization will change again. Therefore, in this sense, it can be considered a temporary reform. Kato asked: Is the Ambassador stationed in Manchuria and the Commander of the Kwantung Army not held by the same person concurrently?</p>
<p>Prime Minister Okada replied: They are the same person.</p>
<p>Kato asked: Then, is the candidate for Plenipotentiary Ambassador limited to the Army Commander?</p>
<p>Prime Minister Okada replied: Yes.</p>
<p>Kato asked: When the Army appoints the Commander of the Kwantung Army, does it consult with the Prime Minister on the candidate?</p>
<p>Minister of the Army Hayashi replied: Appointing an Army Commander falls under the Supreme Command and does not require consultation with the Prime Minister. However, when appointing a Plenipotentiary Ambassador, consultation is necessary. Kato then pointed out the contradiction of the Kwantung Army Commander, who is appointed after being reported to the Emperor, and the Plenipotentiary Ambassador, who is appointed after a Cabinet decision, being held by the same person. He pressed the Prime Minister to the end, but the Prime Minister's responses lacked clarity.</p>
<p>Kato further asked: If the official system is established, and the Army Commander is under the supervision of the Prime Minister, can the Prime Minister completely supervise him?</p>
<p>Prime Minister Okada replied: He can supervise him.</p>
<p>Kato asked about the issue of Supreme Command and the issue of supervision, pressing the Prime Minister. Prime Minister Okada also debated with him. Kato then mentioned the Japan-Manchukuo Protocol.</p>
<p>Kato asked: Since Japan intends to develop [Manchukuo], should the Japan-Manchukuo Protocol be concluded with more detailed treaties to promote Japan-Manchukuo amity? Although [Manchukuo] is an independent country, it has close relations with Japan. Without Japan's active assistance, its development cannot be expected. What do the Army Minister and Foreign Minister believe?</p>
<p>Minister of the Army Hayashi replied: He shares the same opinion as Mr. Kato.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Hirota replied: Upholding the independence of [Manchukuo] is not only Japan's great ideal but also the foundation of peace in East Asia. Therefore, Japan does not hesitate to provide active assistance.</p>
<p>Kato asked: How is the diplomatic work progressing?</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Hirota replied: There is no need to conclude new treaties in addition to the Japan-Manchukuo Protocol.</p>
<p>Kato asked: Does the Foreign Minister have the intention to be responsible for strengthening the Japan-Manchukuo Protocol?</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Hirota replied: Japan and Manchukuo have a special relationship, and I intend to work hard to fulfill my duties.</p>
<p>When it was noon, Kato temporarily stopped questioning, and the meeting recessed.</p>
<p>The Budget Committee continued its meeting in the afternoon. Mr. Kato pursued the Army Minister regarding the issue of agencies stationed in Manchuria and the procedures for appointing the Commander of the Kwantung Army. Thereupon, Army Minister Hayashi rose and answered as follows: When deciding on the Army Commander, the three senior officials of the Army will deliberate before making a decision. Everything is considered appropriate. As for the Army Commander as Plenipotentiary Ambassador, he should consult with the Prime Minister. If he fails to obtain the Prime Minister's consent, the three senior officials must reconsider and strive to align their views with the Prime Minister's before proceeding.</p>
<p>Kato asked: The Army Minister's remarks seem to narrow the scope and boundaries of reporting to the Emperor. I have this understanding. However, the issue of the League of Nations' agencies stationed in Manchuria, which arose from ending the police officers of the Kwantung Government-General, is this related to the responsibility of the Minister of Colonial Affairs?</p>
<p>As Kato finished speaking, he directed his gaze directly at the Prime Minister. Thereupon, Prime Minister Okada rose and replied: When reforming the agencies stationed in Manchuria, the general public's so-called state of opposition within the government departments is definitely not the case. There may have been misunderstandings, but today, those misunderstandings have long been dispelled.</p>
<p>Kato asked: To maintain the security of Manchuria, is it necessary for the commander of the military police to concurrently serve as the chief of police of the Kwantung Government-General? What is the reason? Army Minister Hayashi explained the details as follows: There are two reasons: The situation in Manchuria has changed since the independence of [Manchukuo]. Therefore, the unification of the police is necessary for the security of Manchuria. Hence, it is placed under the jurisdiction of the military police. This is one of the reasons. The center of Manchurian administration is in the Kwantung Government-General. Therefore, external conspiracies all arise from the Kwantung Government-General and the South Manchuria Railway-affiliated areas. Moreover, since [Manchukuo] is not yet consolidated, the police in the heart of Manchuria, i.e., the Kwantung Leased Territory, must also be placed under the jurisdiction of the commander of the military police. This may cause some grievances to the police officers of the Government-General, but it is truly unavoidable due to the circumstances. It is definitely not the military monopolizing police power. The supplementary appointment of the Army Commander is indeed an exercise of the Supreme Command.</p>
<p>Kato asked: What is the Army Minister's view on the joint defense in the Japan-Manchukuo Protocol?</p>
<p>Minister of the Army Hayashi replied: Maintaining the security of Manchuria is not only for suppressing bandits. In terms of relations with neighboring countries, it is for stabilizing internal morale and establishing the foundation of [Manchukuo]. Combining these various circumstances is what is called national defense.</p>
<p>Kato asked: I heard that an economic conference between Japan and Manchukuo is to be established. What does the Prime Minister believe?</p>
<p>Prime Minister Okada replied: It is still undecided in the current Cabinet.</p>
<p>Kato asked: How will the Japan-Manchukuo tariff issue be resolved?</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Hirota rose and replied: We are currently working on it and will realize it.</p>
<p>Kato asked: Regarding the organization of the new economy of Manchuria, there are various rumors in the world. The so-called state socialism is quite contrary to our national conditions. What is the Army's view?</p>
<p>Minister of the Army Hayashi replied: I am not aware of this matter. However, if the agencies stationed in Manchuria are established, there will not be such extreme situations. It may even be possible to discover an ideal economic organization.</p>
<p>Kato asked: Recently, there have been general discussions about unconditionally returning the South Manchuria Railway-affiliated areas within [Manchukuo]. What is the truth?</p>
<p>Prime Minister Okada replied: We cannot unconditionally return them. It is always necessary to consider it carefully.</p>
<p>Mr. Kato's questioning concluded here. Next, Mr. Shimizu will raise questions.</p>
<p>Mr. Shimizu Ginzo made a general inquiry on how to operate constitutional government at the Budget Committee. Next, after questioning Finance Minister Takahashi regarding the issue of responsibility, he raised the issue of diplomacy towards China, questioning its direction. Foreign Minister Hirota replied:</p>
<p>Maintaining peace in the Orient is the fundamental spirit.</p>
<p>Shimizu asked:</p>
<p>Is diplomacy towards China following the consistent direction as stated by the Foreign Minister?</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Hirota replied:</p>
<p>If it is the policy of the Japanese Empire, there is only one line; there is no reason for two.</p>
<p>Mr. Shimizu's questioning concluded here. Next, Saito Takao of the Constitutional Democratic Party asked questions centered on disaster countermeasures. Then, the meeting was temporarily recessed at 5:40 PM and reopened at 7:00 PM. It is said that it will be adjourned only late at night.</p>
<p>The term of the 66th Extraordinary Diet session was originally scheduled to expire on the 4th. The government, in light of the discussion of the budget proposal, convened an extraordinary Cabinet meeting in the Diet at 4:45 PM on the 4th. As a result of the deliberation, it was decided to extend the session for three days. It was immediately approved by the Emperor, and the edict was published in the official gazette extraordinary edition on the same day. (Domei dispatch, 4th)</p>

<p>Hull Expresses Enthusiastic Approval</p>
<p>Reiterates Unchanged Traditional Policy</p>
<p>Maintaining Peace and Open Door</p>
<p>(Washington) British-American cooperation has become even stronger today after Secretary of State Hull issued a frank and cautious statement. Mr. Hull stated to the press that he supports the British-American cooperation currently underway in London. Although the wording of the statement broadly refers to closer economic cooperation among countries around the world, its intention clearly refers to Britain. However, Mr. Hull carefully avoided expressing that British-American cooperation is opposed to Japan's naval demands or the [Manchukuo] oil monopoly incident. Mr. Hull believes that the naval issue should be discussed by the three-nation representatives in London, and the oil issue should be handled separately by Britain and the United States. However, according to the State Department's recent review of American Far East policy, it has been decided to maintain the traditional policies of peace, the open door, and avoiding combinations that could cause disputes, regardless of what combinations other countries may have in the Far East. The British authorities have sought American views on what action to take after Japan abolishes the naval treaty. Diplomatic circles believe that Britain intends to establish British-American naval coordination, so that the United States will propose concrete conditions in exchange for British cooperation in maintaining the political and naval status quo in the Far East. Mr. Hull's remarks today indicate that the State Department supports economic ties but is unwilling to go beyond the scope of economic ties. (Kokumin dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull issued a statement today criticizing the remarks made by American Ambassador to Britain, Bingham, published in the London Observer on December 2nd, saying that in the past few years, world economic events have been undermined by the extreme isolationism and nationalism. Bingham's remarks can be said to be an effort to eliminate this spirit. The United States is willing to seek sincere and practical cooperation with many countries to remove obstacles in international finance and commerce. Other countries can act jointly with the United States in their own independent ways. Washington officials generally believe that Hull's remarks support Bingham but do not focus solely on cooperation between Britain and the United States, fearing that it will cause misunderstandings among countries such as Japan. According to Ambassador Bingham's remarks, the main purpose is to promote British-American cooperation. His words include "If Britain and the United States firmly grasp the current opportunity and initiate close cooperation, the world's panic can be dispelled soon, and various diplomatic difficulties in the world can be solved easily. If Britain and President Roosevelt reach an understanding, it will be equivalent to establishing a permanent understanding with the American people," etc. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>

<p>US-Japan Meeting Still Yields No Results</p>
<p>Naval Negotiations Continue Despite the Odds</p>
<p>(London) The British and American naval delegations will meet this afternoon in the British House of Commons. This is the first time in several weeks. According to the impression of the general public, this meeting will discuss the issue of what countermeasures Britain and America should take after Japan threatens to abolish the Washington Naval Treaty. The Japanese side claims that the abolition of the treaty will not affect the current naval talks because it only involves the provisions of not establishing defensive works. Britain does not seem to accept this view. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The case of abolishing the Washington Naval Treaty has now been completed in terms of all diplomatic procedures upon receiving the reply from the Italian government. After completing the consultation procedures on approximately the 19th, the announcement can be issued on the 20th. (Domei dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(London) After the luncheon hosted by British delegation head Davis, representative Yamamoto met alone with Admiral Stanley, but they did not discuss substantive issues. Yamamoto left without gaining anything. It seems that Yamamoto and Stanley will not meet again in the future. The attitude of the American delegation remains unchanged. Whether there is hope for the future of the talks depends on the outcome of the British-Japanese talks. The Japanese government has decided to abolish the Washington Treaty, and the possibility of the American delegation returning home is becoming more and more certain. (Domei dispatch, 3rd) (London) At noon today, the American naval delegation hosted a banquet for the naval representatives of Britain and Japan. After the banquet, American officials believed that although the Japanese side still insisted on giving up the ratio system and demanding naval equality, it seemed possible to concede to the British reconciliation plan's proposal to mutually notify each other of naval plans. It would not be necessary to recognize naval equality in advance as a prerequisite. If so, then the Japanese side has already recognized the main part of the British reconciliation plan. Thus, there is some hope for the future of the naval talks. According to the British proposal on November 8, which was put forward to reconcile the opinions of the United States and Japan, it contained two suggestions. The main point was to recognize in principle Japan's equal rights in security, but the participating countries of the Naval Treaty should agree with a [gentlemen's agreement] to mutually notify each other of shipbuilding procedures and modifications. The naval plan notification mentioned in this telegram refers to this. (Havas dispatch, 3rd)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Italian Ambassador to Japan, Mr. Auriti, received instructions from the Roman government today, and immediately visited Foreign Minister Hirota at the House of Peers at 5:25 PM to convey the Italian government's rejection of Japan's proposal for a joint abrogation of the Washington Treaty. (Washington dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>◎ Rome The Japanese government recently requested that Italy and France jointly announce the abolition of the Washington Naval Treaty. The Italian government rejected this request today. It is reported that the wording of the rejection stated that the Italian government is willing to strive to avoid any proposal that would create regional confrontation among countries. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding Japan's request for France and Italy to simultaneously declare the abolition of the Washington Naval Treaty, the information published in foreign newspapers is mostly incomplete. In reality, the French government replied to the Japanese government that the qualitative limitations stipulated in the Washington Naval Treaty no longer correspond with the French government's views. This is because when these qualitative limitations were established, the German navy had not yet recovered. Now, the situation has already changed. The French government is willing to jointly announce the abolition of the Washington Naval Treaty with all signatory countries, but to avoid misunderstandings, France is delaying making a definitive decision on the Japanese government's special requests made during the London Naval Conference, and will not take joint action with the Japanese government.

<p>(London) The American delegation believes that the Japanese government's cabinet decision on the 3rd to abandon the Washington Treaty procedures is an unexpected situation. Therefore, it is necessary to discuss whether the London preparatory talks can continue, and it has been decided to hold Anglo-American talks on the 4th. There are two main proposals for the aftermath: 1) The London preparatory talks will be temporarily adjourned, and the entire American delegation will return home, to be reopened next spring. The Disarmament Main Conference will be held in June next year. 2) The form of the abolition talks will be changed to ordinary diplomatic negotiations, and the former proposal is the most powerful.

<h3 id="e37">Japanese Delegation Issues Statement <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>(London) Regarding the naval conference talks, the following impressions were obtained from sources close to the Japanese delegation today. The delegation's spokesperson recently told our reporter, "Although Japan does not reject the British compromise proposal in general, it has not found a basis for establishing a three-nation agreement. There are various rumors circulating that our country's attitude has changed. We are taking this opportunity to deny them. Nothing said or proposed by our delegation can be interpreted as a change in attitude. What we are asking for can be summed up in one word: equal rights. Moreover, after equal rights are recognized, technical issues must be discussed to clarify whether these equal rights should be metaphysical or physical. (Note: Metaphysical refers to changing the naval ratio of 5:5:3 to 5:5:5, while physical refers to changing it from 5:5:3 to 3:3:3.) Only through these technical issues can the duration of the implementation of equal rights be determined. Regarding the mutual notification of each country's shipbuilding plans, some parties have expressed considerable optimism, but the actual solution is not easy to determine." When our reporter asked whether Japan's abolition of the Washington Naval Treaty would change the negotiation situation, the spokesperson replied, "This was decided by Tokyo long ago and does not seem to have any impact on the current talks." When the reporter asked if the naval talks would end from now on, the spokesperson replied, "This is not something we can decide." (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>

<p>Japan's Increased Fourfold Since the Manchurian Incident</p>
<p>France Ranks First in Air Force Strength, Japan Fourth</p>
<p>(Washington) According to the results of an investigation by the Foreign Policy Association, the military expenditures of the world's major powers, except for Germany, are generally greater than before the war. This state of armament has become particularly rapid since Japan's occupation of Manchuria in 1931 and the Nazi Party's assumption of power in Germany. The naval, land, and air force budgets of the major countries are as follows: France increased by 256% compared to 1913, Italy increased by 26.35%, England increased by 48.8%, the United States increased by 190.9%, and Japan increased by 388%. Japan's military spending has doubled since the Manchurian Incident. The United States' military expenditure was $244,000,000 in 1913, and by 1930 it had increased to over $700,000,000. Germany, however, is restricted by the Treaty of Versailles and cannot do as it pleases. As for the air force, France ranks first, with 3,000 military aircraft of various types. Soviet Russia ranks second, with 2,800 to 3,000 aircraft. The United States ranks third, with 2,468 aircraft. Japan has 1,600 aircraft. Italy has 1,500 aircraft. England has the fewest, with only 1,400 aircraft. (Kokumin dispatch, 4th)</p>

<p>Saar Problem and South Hungarian Dispute Under Discussion</p>
<p>(London) The current session of the League of Nations Council will open tomorrow and a special conference will be held to discuss various issues related to the Saar plebiscite. Although the meeting is convened for the Saar problem, it may also discuss Yugoslavia's complaint that Hungary was involved in the Marseille assassination. According to the Yugoslav government's memorandum to the League of Nations last week, evidence was presented proving that terrorist organizations were established within Hungary. However, the text lacks clarity regarding whether the Hungarian authorities were aware of and supported it. The British Lord Privy Seal, Anthony Eden, has already departed for Geneva today to participate in the special conference. Soviet Foreign Commissar Maxim Litvinov is also en route to Geneva from Moscow. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>

British Lord Privy Seal Anthony Eden and Yugoslav Foreign Minister Jevtić arrived in the same train as Laval. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) French Foreign Minister Laval arrived here this morning and immediately held talks with French experts on the Saar problem, followed by a meeting with Aloisi, chairman of the Three-Member Committee on the Saar problem. Aloisi will present an explanation of the committee's discussions in Rome. At noon, Laval hosted a banquet for Czech Foreign Minister Beneš, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Jevtić, and Yugoslav Permanent Representative to the League of Nations, Živojin Balugdžić. After the banquet, the three foreign ministers jointly discussed various issues, including: 1) the Saar problem; 2) Yugoslavia's application to the League of Nations regarding the Marseille assassination; 3) the plan for an Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact. The League of Nations' Three-Member Committee on the Saar problem is scheduled to meet at 4:00 PM to complete its report, so that it can be submitted to the member states of the Council tomorrow morning. The Council will hold a closed-door meeting tomorrow afternoon to decide on the procedures to be adopted regarding Yugoslavia's application, and then hold a public meeting to study the report of the Three-Member Committee on the Saar problem. It is generally believed that in the closed-door meeting of the Council, the Yugoslav representative will first formally submit the application, followed by the Hungarian representative submitting a reply. Then, the representatives of the major powers will issue statements. Some countries, such as Britain and Italy, will likely advocate postponing the discussion. However, the majority of the member states of the Council, especially Yugoslavia, will not be satisfied with this procedure. If so, even if a motion is proposed to study a general convention to prevent terrorist acts to conclude the matter, it may not be sufficient. The Council will likely strive to extend the meeting in a spirit of compromise and pass a resolution condemning the Marseille assassination and acts of terrorism in strong terms, so that Yugoslavia may be comforted.

<p>Assuming the Vote Results in Return to Germany</p>
<p>Germany Should Repay French Debt of 900 Million Francs</p>
<p>The Warndt Mines Should Pay Royalties for Five Years</p>
<p>◎ Rome France and Germany reached an agreement here today regarding various issues in the Saar region. The details are as follows: The agreement states that if the Saar plebiscite on January 13 results in a vote in favor of the Saar remaining part of Germany, then France should receive 900 million francs and 11 million tons of coal. In addition, France should receive royalties for five years from the production of the Warndt mines, amounting to approximately 45 million francs. These two mine entrances are located in French territory, while the ore veins extend into Saar territory. The Warndt coal mine is mined by Germany, and the royalties are paid directly to the French Ministry of Finance. However, it is said that all the coal mined belongs to Germany. It is also stipulated that if Germany has not paid off the 900 million francs after five years, 600 million of it will be used to offset the costs of houses, railways, etc., built by the French authorities in the Saar region. It is heard that the paper money currently circulating in the Saar region will be used as part of the payment. It is also heard that Saar residents must declare the actual amount of foreign currency they hold abroad. The 11 million tons of coal paid is part of the cash payment and is the annual output of the Saar coal mine. Germany also promises to guarantee the safety of Saar residents who have not voted with social insurance, and must respect all the rights enjoyed by workers and freedom of religion. It is heard that both France and Germany are quite pleased with this agreement. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>

<p>(Berlin) The Nazi government has been experiencing various difficulties in politics, economics, and society. The Protestant Evangelical Church is also resisting the government over its religious policies. All of this is enough to diminish the prestige of the Nazi regime. Although Nazi Party members outwardly express calm, they are inwardly very anxious. According to observations by Evangelical Church members, the religious policy set by the government is based on the philosophy of racial supremacy and Nazism, in an attempt to unify the churches nationwide. There are fears that this is being done too hastily, which may cause dissatisfaction among Catholics and the Roman Catholic Church in the Saar region and adversely affect the Saar plebiscite. It has been decided to wait until after the plebiscite on January 13 next year before continuing. (Havas dispatch, 3rd)</p>

<p>(Moscow) The Internal Affairs Commission issued a notice regarding the circumstances of Kirov's assassination. According to the investigation, Kirov was drafting a report on the plenary session of the Communist Party Central Committee in December, to be read at the meeting of the Leningrad Party Committee on the same day. When Kirov walked into his office in the Smolny Institute, the receptionist Nikolaev walked out of the neighboring room and approached Kirov from behind. He immediately fired his pistol at Kirov's neck. The assassin was arrested on the spot. Kirov lost consciousness immediately after suffering a fatal wound. He was immediately taken to the office for rescue. When Professors Dubotvorsky, Ganneles, Geser, etc., arrived, Kirov had no pulse and had stopped breathing.

<p>Planning Economic Liaison Between the Mainland and Colonies</p>
<p>(Paris) The French Colonial Conference opened here today to discuss economic reciprocity plans among the 4,680,000 square miles of French territories. The scope of the discussion is limited to industry, commerce, economics, budgets, tariffs, and other issues, so as to avoid purely unimportant local issues that would delay the process and lead to nowhere. Most of the work of this conference will discuss the issues of the territories of Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, and Syria. However, other smaller territories, leased territories, and protectorates will not be neglected. Even the pearl and coconut industries in the French islands in the South China Sea, the rice industry in Vietnam, and the peanut and vegetable oil industries in Senegal will be discussed. The conference represents the interests of 100 million people. According to the Colonial Department, if the various colonies can abandon competition with each other and follow a large-scale liaison plan, commerce will definitely double. To achieve this goal, the various colonies may have to limit production for a certain period of time. Last year, the trade surplus of the colonies to the French mainland was the first time in history. One-third of France's foreign trade is with its territories. Before the global economic decline, colonial purchases of French goods increased annually. Now, if we want to restore commerce, the tariff issue is very important. The world's countries that trade with France and its twenty territories must also pay close attention. (Kokumin dispatch, 3rd)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Tan Zhen stated that China had previously raised the issue of recovering consular jurisdiction, and several countries in the League of Nations had recognized it, while others advocated sending personnel to China for investigation to assess the extent to which China's judiciary had improved before making a decision. At that time, the League of Nations organized an investigation team to China in 1926, during the period when Zhang Zongchang and others were ravaging the judiciary in North China. The impression gained from the investigation was extremely poor, and various countries used this as an excuse to delay. Subsequently, after the government's vigorous negotiations, some progress was made, namely the abolition of the Shanghai Mixed Court and the conclusion of the agreement on the Shanghai Special District Court. Before long, national crises occurred, and China requested the League of Nations to resolve these more important matters than the judicial issue, so it was put aside. It is found that the said agreement had a validity period of three years, and after it expired last year, it was extended for another three years. At present, China's judicial improvements have made considerable progress, and various legal regulations to perfect the judiciary have also been promulgated and implemented one after another. When I met with judicial authorities from various countries in Europe, they were all very clear about the progress of China's judiciary. When the agreement expires in the future, it is expected to be brought up for negotiation to demand its return. I believe this kind of demand is very proper and reasonable. If our judiciary becomes increasingly sound, there will be no problem in recovering consular jurisdiction. (Special dispatch, 4th)</p>

The unfavorable factors were the uncertainty of major commodity market conditions, which made general sentiment uneasy, and that the impetus for recent increases was lacking.

<h3 id="e98">Liang's Division Recovers Geyuan <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Geyuan is a Base for Bandits on the Borders of Jiangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Anhui</p>
<p>It Will Not Be Difficult to Sweep Away the Remnant Bandits Retreating Towards Dexing</p>
<p>Nanchang Communication: Geyuan belongs to Hengfeng and can connect to Chong'an in Fujian via Qianshan in the south, reach the Xin River via Yiyang in the west, and is intertwined with the border of Rao in Yushan and Zhejiang in the east. It is closely connected to Dexing in the north, remotely connecting to Wuyuan and Qimen, and the terrain is high, steep, and difficult to attack. Therefore, after the bandit Fang Zhimin's birthplace, Mobanshan, was broken by Lu Xiaochen's troops in the 19th year, he used Geyuan as his only base. Important institutions such as the pseudo Northeast Revolutionary Committee, the pseudo Jiangxi-Zhejiang-Anhui Military Region Headquarters, and the pseudo Jiangxi-Zhejiang-Anhui Provincial Government were all located there. Even institutions such as the pseudo Post Office, the pseudo Arsenal, and the pseudo Agricultural and Industrial Bank were painstakingly managed. For several years, the bandits in eastern Jiangxi, northern Fujian, western Zhejiang, and southern Anhui have taken this as their command center. Previously, Chairman Chiang appointed Chen Diaoyuan as the Commander-in-Chief of the Five-Province Bandit Suppression Reserve Army, supervising Zhao Guantao, Yu Jishi, and others to command the armies of Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Anhui to encircle and suppress the bandits, also taking Geyuan as the goal of their meeting. Its importance on the borders of the three provinces is like Ruijin on the borders of Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Fujian. Since the joint suppression by the troops of Tang Huiyuan, Liang Lizhu, Yu Jishi, and Ruan Zhaochang, Hengfeng has been recovered, but the bandits have retreated to a corner of Geyuan, still maintaining their last base. Another part of the bandit army, along with the pseudo Ninth Army and Luo Binghui's troops, fled to Fujian, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi, making circular movements, hoping to expand the guerrilla area and disperse the national army's suppression forces, as an attempt to cut off the water at the base of the cauldron for Hengfeng and Geyuan. After the national army inflicted heavy damage on the bandits in Zhejiang on the border of Zhejiang by Zhao Guantao and Yu Jishi, the bandits on the border of Anhui were intercepted by Chen Diaoyuan's troops, and the scattered bandits in Fuliang and Dexing were severely attacked by Li Zongjian's troops. Geyuan was attacked and captured by Liang Lizhu's troops of the 21st Division. Since last year, starting from Hekou, they have launched an upward attack, advancing in the overlapping mountains with bunkers and highways alternately, like grinding ink. After dozens or hundreds of battles, they approached Geyuan last month. At that time, the pseudo Tenth Army's 83rd Regiment, 87th Regiment, and Shangrao Pseudo Independent Battalion, which guarded the nest, took Geyuan as the core of the bandits, and built densely packed and heavily stacked fortifications on the surrounding mountains and strategic passes to resist stubbornly. However, the national army's Lu Regiment bravely climbed, charged upwards in hand-to-hand combat. The Gan Regiment also led troops to advance fiercely at the same time, and finally broke through the bandit bunkers and fortifications, completely recovering Geyuan on November 28th. The Overseas Chinese Northeast Military Region Headquarters, the pseudo Fujian and Zhejiang Provincial Government, the pseudo Red Army Fifth Branch School, the pseudo Shangrao County Government, the pseudo New Communist Training Center, the pseudo Agricultural School, the pseudo Postal Administration, various pseudo party headquarters, pseudo Economic Committees, and other institutions were completely destroyed. The remnant bandits retreated northward towards Dexing. In addition to telegraphing □□□ troops to intercept them, Liang's Division is currently searching for remnant bandits, searching for weapons buried by bandits, repairing fortifications, sheltering refugees, and handling the aftermath to stabilize society. The base of the Red bandits on the borders of the three provinces has been lost, and it will not be difficult to eliminate the scattered bandits that are separated and lurking by combining suppression and appeasement.

<h3 id="e99">After the Recovery of Bandit Areas in Jiangxi Province <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Material Shortages Are Being Actively Addressed</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: After the Red bandits abandoned their base areas of seven or eight years and fled west en masse, all the bandit areas have been successively recovered by the National Army. However, after the devastation of the bandit areas, all necessities of life are being supplied by the rear. The most lacking and necessary items in the bandit areas are briefly described below:</p>
<h3 id="e100">Medicine <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Since the bandit areas were blockaded, no Chinese or Western medicines flowed in at all. Although a small amount was occasionally obtained through guerrilla warfare or secret attacks, only high-ranking military officers who were seriously injured or ill could benefit. The rest of the soldiers mostly used herbal and folk medicines for treatment. Many wounded soldiers in the bandits' so-called rear hospitals died from festering wounds and maggots. Therefore, in various places recovered by the National Army, sick soldiers and refugees are everywhere. Various medicines are available for money but not on the market. The rescue and treatment teams organized by the Ministry of Health and the Jiangxi Provincial Health Department have dispatched fifteen teams to be stationed in Ruijin, Jinxi, Yudu, Xingguo, Shicheng, Guangchang, Xiaosong, Baishui, and Xin'an. The dying and abandoned who seek treatment are as if returning to the marketplace.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Cotton <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The bandit areas neither produce cotton nor import cloth. Ruijin, being the bandits' capital, previously had coarse cloth selling for several dimes per foot. When the bandits retreated, they took every last thread. The old and weak who did not leave were barely covered, and those who escaped from the bandit ranks were also in tattered clothes. In the severe winter, many refugees are in single layers. The head of the Department of Civil Affairs, having witnessed this miserable situation on the front lines, returned and convened an emergency meeting by the provincial government to launch a campaign to solicit winter clothing. Mobilization and solicitation have been carried out in various schools, chambers of commerce, and party headquarters, and tens of thousands of cotton-padded garments have been raised. These have been distributed to various counties such as Ruijin, Shicheng, Xingguo, and Yudu. The Provincial Suppression Committee and the Provincial Party Headquarters are still continuing to solicit donations from other counties.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Rice Grain <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>All able-bodied men in the bandit areas were drafted into the bandit army, leaving no one to cultivate the land. Moreover, after the land was divided, the rice grain obtained by the farmers was heavily taxed by the pseudo-township Soviet governments, leading to wasteland overgrown with weeds knee-high. Rice grain production decreased, while the bandits' consumption increased daily. In various districts newly recovered by the National Army, no one has a surplus of even a dipper of grain. Military officers stationed in Yudu, Xingguo, and other places have telegraphed the province requesting the transport of rice for relief. However, transportation is extremely difficult. For example, transporting rice from Nanchang to Yudu costs thirty-six yuan. It is said that the Agricultural Bank and the former Food Administration will be used to transport the rice grain stored in Linchuan, Ji'an, Taihe, and other places for relief. The famine situation is particularly severe in various places in southern Jiangxi, requiring urgent attention. The situation is slightly better on the upper reaches of the Fu River and along both banks of the Gan River.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Salt <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Since the strict implementation of the blockade, people in areas bordering the bandit areas have been purchasing two qian of salt and lamp oil daily with public sale permits, so no amount leaks into the bandit areas. Only in areas near the Fujian and Guangdong borders, such as Huichang and Yudu, can small amounts be smuggled in through various means, costing several liang per yuan. After the National Army recovered various places, the people, having not eaten salt for a long time, often have swollen heads and faces. Recently, a large quantity of salt has been transported by truck to Ningdu, Yudu, Huichang, and Shicheng for emergency relief. Xingguo will hold a salt distribution. When the Sixth Route Army held a military-civilian gathering in Longgang, several liang of salt were distributed to each person, and everyone rejoiced as if they had obtained a treasure.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Able-Bodied Men <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The population of the bandit areas has decreased dramatically due to continuous warfare and escape. During this westward flight of the Red bandits, in addition to those already enlisted in the bandit army, all able-bodied men who could move were coerced to the west by the bandits. In the newly recovered districts, there are only a few old, weak, sick, or more women than men. Even healthy women have been conscripted into propaganda and comfort teams. In the future, the only solution will be to immigrate and cultivate wasteland.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Ironware <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The oxen and livestock of the farmers in the bandit areas have long been slaughtered and eaten. Even the farmers' iron tools such as plows, hoes, and spades have been melted down by the bandits for use as weapons and spears. The replenishment of iron tools and farming implements in the future will also become a major problem. (November 29th)</p>

<h3 id="e106">Malianjing, Where Vegetation Is Lush <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Daquan is one station away from Malianjing and two stations away from Xingxing Gorge. Due to waiting for the escort team, we stayed in Daquan on the 11th and did not move forward. It was not until noon on the 12th that the escort team arrived, and we set off immediately and reached Malianjing.</p>
<p>In recent years, traffic between Anxi and Hami has been relatively peaceful due to the efforts of the troops stationed in the two cities. The robbery at Xingxing Gorge was indeed unexpected. After receiving the reporter's letter, Ma Shou-xuan, commander of the Anxi Ma Regiment, believed that the incident was related to the duties of the garrison. In addition to dispatching company adjutant Han Zhan-yuan and soldiers Ma Er-gong and others, seven people in total, to bring dry rations and weapons and come day and night to escort them out of the border, he also sent two cavalry teams to Masonsan and Dunhuang to prevent the bandits from carrying the stolen goods away. Han and Ma carried a military telephone and borrowed the new Gansu telegraph line to talk directly to Commander Ma of Anxi. He learned that he had telegraphed Dr. Yao Le, commander of the Hami garrison, who had also sent troops east to welcome and escort them. Everyone was delighted.</p>
<p>We set off from Daquan, the land was flat, and the weather was clear. After traveling about twenty li, we suddenly encountered a violent cold wind with snowflakes flying. Although it stopped after a moment, the wind became colder and stronger, so that even heavy fur coats were not warm, and the lips were stiff and difficult to speak. Sitting high on the camel, the cold was truly unbearable. At that time, the camels were just starting their journey, fat and tall, walking with broad strides and steady gaits. Riding in the cold was quite difficult. Unexpectedly, when passing a stone gorge, the camel ridden by Mr. Su took a big step and suddenly threw Mr. Su to the ground, his wrist bleeding profusely. However, due to the cold, not much blood flowed and soon congealed like pine resin, but it was still painful. The camel sedan that the reporter was riding in was made of ropes and felt, and one camel could carry two people, which was relatively warm. However, it was a pity that we could not communicate with the seated Shang Mu-sha. Seeing that Mr. Su was injured, I specially exchanged rides with him to help him recover. Later, the wind grew stronger, and the cold increased. The reporter sat sideways to avoid the wind for more than ten li. Unexpectedly, the oilcloth he was carrying broke, and the wind blew it away. The camel was startled and ran away. The reporter was thrown down again, fortunately on the sandy ground, and only his buttocks were slightly sore. Getting up and doing some exercise, the camel driver smiled embarrassedly and said, "A donkey falls lightly, a horse falls heavily, but when a camel falls, even if you have a life, you won't move. That you can still do foreign exercises at this moment is really everyone's luck." Later, he changed to riding a donkey, and finally safely arrived at Malianjing, a distance of seventy li, and the wind also stopped suddenly.</p>
<p>The hardship of riding a camel had been experienced before in the grasslands of Inner Mongolia. This time, because there were no cars or horses, (from Su to Xinjiang, there used to be high-wheeled carts pulled by five horses, in which one could sit or lie down, but now there are none. If riding mules and horses, the exposed fodder would require two more horses to carry, which is also quite troublesome), we rekindled our relationship with camels. Although we were thrown down today, we have learned four things to pay attention to when riding camels: (1) You must ride the head camel because it is docile and the camel driver can pull it, making it less likely to be dangerous. The other camels following behind are bound to become increasingly fierce. (2) The camel driver is responsible for properly securing the luggage, as well as tightening the saddle and bellyband (camel transport does not usually use a bellyband), and then holding the saddle rope and sitting upright on it. You must not imitate the camel driver by climbing up and down the neck, and you must not sit sideways or lie down freely. (3) When getting on and off, you must wait for the camel to lie down firmly before moving. (4) It is best to still use a camel sedan, so that the elderly and women can be safe. Sitting in it is more comfortable for rain and convenience than riding a horse.</p>
<p>Malianjing used to have village houses and temples, but they have all disappeared. The postman's residence, three earthen houses with red willow woven doors, can still barely provide shelter from the wind and rain. Looking out over the flat fields, yellow grass grows densely. Areas with saline-alkali soil can all be reclaimed into farmland. When asked, "Why is there no one to cultivate them?", the answer was that wells must be dug very deep before reaching the water source. The so-called "very deep" initially seemed to be a metaphor using a horse stick or ox rod, short being two or three chi, and long being no more than five chi. Later, seeing the depth of each well, it did not exceed what was expected. If we can emulate the method of digging wells for irrigation in Shandong, immigrate and cultivate land, and engage in large-scale operations, then the barren land can immediately be turned into fertile soil, and the abandoned ruins can become strong defenses.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of shrubs and weeds here. Walking around and collecting them, we quickly obtained more than thirty kinds. The camel driver knew the local names of more than twenty kinds: red willow, also known as Guanyin willow, four or five chi high, with spike-shaped red flowers, small and dense branches and leaves, and old trunks coiled on the ground; white thorns, with branches and trunks that are strong and white, densely covered with small granular leaves and sharp thorns; yellow wood head, with old trunks that are short and thick, densely covered with yellow-green branches, seemingly without flowers or leaves; Bawangchai is quite similar to white thorns, but coarser and without thorns; Shenghun branches and trunks are like vines, very tough, and can be used to pierce camel noses (the above are shrubs).</p>
<p>Achnatherum splendens sprouts new seedlings in the spring, the same as ordinary grass, withers in the winter but does not decay, three or four chi high, white in color, and tough. It can be used to weave cool hats and baskets. If you encounter a solid one, it can also be used as chopsticks. The "Book of Han" mentions "one-breath chicken grass." Cen Shen's poem "The north wind rolls the ground" [one break of white grass] all refers to this grass. Trowel-leaf grass has leaves that are yellow and shaped like trowels, and looks like scissors or hooks. The growth is similar to cactus. Camel thorn has leaves like locust trees, but they are not compound, the branches are lush, and the thorns are sharp. Camels like to eat it. Tobacco-like plants have opposite compound leaves, smaller than fingernails. They can be mixed with real tobacco and smoked. Astragalus chrysanthus of the chrysanthemum family has flowers that curl inwards after shedding, shaped like bone protuberances, but they smell bad and cannot be used as feed. Malian grass has flowers and leaves like orchids, also called Malan grass, with purple-blue flowers that are very beautiful. The pods split and explode. Also false orchids. Camel hoofs are of the amaranth family, with thick and fleshy leaves shaped like camel hoofs. Red sand cork has branches and leaves similar to artemisia, and small pink flowers that are also very beautiful. Reeds are the same as those grown in the interior, but not tall and fertile. Zhaolaojiao has broad, sprawling leaves, small white flowers, and fruits like goat horns. The inner seeds are flat grains of brown color. After the sharp ends of the fruits split, the seeds fly away with the wind. Grain-leaf grass has stems and leaves that are drooping like rice ears, with a lot of moisture. Grass of the genus Agropyron, in the grass family, is a type of wild wheat. Lalajiang has tall branches and stems, and autumn leaves like wax, with beautiful white inflorescences. Diqianjiang, also known as sweet radish, has long and wide leaves and thick roots, with a sweet and sour taste. Sea cypress, in the artemisia family, has branches and leaves like cypress, green in summer and red in autumn, adding to the beauty of the desert landscape. It contains saline moisture and sometimes reveals saltpeter on the outside. Gray strips and white artemisia, yellow artemisia, etc., are also produced in the interior (the above herbs can be used for feed). In addition, there are important medicines such as elephant ear leaves, which are wide and large and look like elephant ears, with flowers like herbaceous begonias that are extremely beautiful, as well as plantain, rhubarb, ephedra, licorice, fragrant artemisia, yinchen, and Suoyang, all of which are abundant.</p>
<p>Suoyang is a holy medicine for tonifying yang. Soldier Ma Er-gong inadvertently dug up three branches while burying telephone ground lines. After peeling off the scaly red skin, a pink color was initially revealed, as thick as an infant's wrist. The inner texture is tender and crisp, quite like sweet potatoes. Chewing it raw is sweet and slightly astringent. At that time, a postman named Niu was nearby, and he dug up several more branches by digging in the cracked ground, which were even thicker than before. The postmen at nearby stations do not farm or harvest, and the only vegetable they have is Suoyang, which they shred and steam with noodles, and the taste becomes purely sweet. Other things like licorice and ephedra are even cut and used as firewood, and no one has yet used them for medicinal purposes. This is probably a mistake due to the misconception that "deserts are barren."</p>

<p>Discovery of a Dead Man on the Road in Zhangzhuang</p>
<p>Yesterday, a dead man was found on the road in Zhangzhuang, Twenty-first Ward, near Shihudang. He was wearing a gray wool serge robe, gray wool serge pants, and gray wool serge shoes. The township police of the ward reported it to the county court. The court prosecutor, along with an autopsy clerk, conducted an examination and determined that the death was due to natural causes. However, the deceased was nearly thirty years old. What caused his tragic death and who his family members are will only be known after a public notice is issued to claim the body, and an investigation will then begin.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Hooligan Bandit Xiao Gen, Executed by Firing Squad in Nanhui <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The hooligan bandit Liu Genfa (also known as Xiao Genfa), a native of Tangjiao Mouth in this county, colluded with Mao Muxiang and Liu Aluan, who had previously been executed, to repeatedly rob and injure people and kidnap people for ransom in the coastal areas of this county, committing numerous crimes. He was wanted for arrest but had not been apprehended. Recently, the suspect robbed the Penglai Bank in the Penglai Market in Shanghai in collaboration with others. After the case was discovered, he was arrested under the alias Li Ziyun. After investigation by the county government, he was escorted back from the Shanghai District Court. The victims Pan Genlou, Pan Xuelin, Mao Zhuqing, and Mao Quanlou were summoned to identify him. It was confirmed that the suspect was indeed guilty of robbery and kidnapping. It was also found that Mao Muxiang, Liu Aluan, and others had originally testified that the suspect was indeed one of the ringleaders. The county government had sentenced him to death, and the sentence was submitted to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for approval by telegram. Yesterday morning at ten o'clock, the suspect was taken to court, where trial judge Jiang confirmed his identity and escorted him to the execution ground outside the South Gate, where he was executed by firing squad.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Villagers in Suzhou Riot, Burn Houses, and Resist Rent <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Villagers in Xietang and Kuatang outside Suzhou previously used unfair wasteland surveys as an excuse to vent their anger on rent collectors, gathering crowds to burn down dozens of the rent collectors' houses, causing a huge disturbance. After the government sent troops to suppress the riot, it was quelled. Recently, landlords and merchants have been rushing to collect rent. Unexpectedly, on the second day, the houses of rent collector Wu Tongquan in Linjiagang, Jiaozhi Township, and the houses of rent collectors Sun Qiutao, Sun Tingtao, and Sun Qiucha, and the house of Xing Ronggen in Yaobang, and the house of Jiang Rongfu in Luxiang were again set on fire by villagers, destroying more than sixty houses in four villages and six families, resulting in huge losses. The villagers dispersed at dawn. After the incident, the Sixth Branch of the Public Security Bureau sent police to arrest them, but it was too late. The farmers involved in the incident were not local farmers but came from Xietang, Chefang, and other places. After hearing the report, the county government immediately sent the Seventh Security Brigade to suppress the riot and investigate and arrest the ringleaders. After the security team arrived in the township, they deployed defenses in each village to prevent any accidents. The county government has already reported to the provincial government for instructions. As for the issue of rent payment by the farmers, discounts and concessions have been resolved, but very few have paid their rent. An investigation revealed that someone was preventing them from doing so. Yesterday (the fourth), a passenger surnamed Su, who was traveling on a Suzhou-Changzhou bus, said that when the bus passed Weijingtang outside Qimen, he saw farmers disembark to investigate. They saw villagers coming to the city to pay rent and firmly persuaded them to go ashore and postpone the rent payment. The situation seemed to indicate that someone was instigating rent resistance. It is not clear whether it is related to the burning of the rent collectors' houses. Furthermore, more than one hundred farmers, including Yang Guichun from Nanguo, submitted a petition to the county government, accusing rent collector Jiang Rongfu of falsely reporting wasteland, engaging in embezzlement and bribery, and harming others for personal gain. They requested an investigation and a reassessment to ensure fairness.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of winter, robberies have been frequently heard in the four townships, and even in the well-defended urban areas, there have been three cases of robbery and injury. According to news reports, the house of Xu Genjin, a villager in Miaojinbang Township, Lieshu, was visited by seven bandits on the night of the third, who robbed him of more than one hundred yuan in silver and clothing. On the morning of the third, a bandit boat arrived in Tangjiaxiang, Lumu Township, carrying more than ten bandits, who landed and robbed. The victims included He Gaosheng and Yin Zhou, who lost more than three hundred yuan. The bandit boat arrived in Zhanggeng, Huangdai Township, and more than ten bandits rushed into the house of Zhang Longfu, searched arbitrarily, and went to Xihedang. On the dawn of the fourth, the house of farmer Zhu Ronggui in Xishan Township, along Taihu Lake, was robbed by bandits, who kidnapped Zhu Ronggui's eight-year-old son, Agou, before leaving.</p>

<p>After this year's drought, the poor had no clothes or food, leading to a surge in theft cases. In the past two nights, several robberies occurred in urban and rural areas. Excerpts are as follows: (1) Baoshun Credit Union's fast boat, traveling from Wuxi to Suzhou, was passing Hongmiaotou when a boat from Jiangbei suddenly approached. Six bandits jumped out with a pistol and robbed six yuan in letters and two yuan and ninety cents in change. The boat had to turn back. (2) A wonton shop owner in Jiangxi Bridge, Second District, was robbed of four yuan by bandits in Yupu Temple. Another villager's family nearby was robbed of rice and grain carts. None of them have reported the incidents to the police. (3) Wang, the wife of Shao Renhong, a resident of Wuxi, was returning home from watching a play at Qingsheng last night. On the way, her handbag was snatched, resulting in a loss of nine yuan.</p>

<p>At about 4 p.m. on the (3rd) of the day before yesterday, a young female guest, about twenty years old, arrived at the City Park Hotel and booked room 43 on the third floor. The guest registration card showed her name as Zhou Yufen, from Heqiao, and she paid the room fee. At about 6 p.m., she went out once in person, bought 200 wen worth of sorghum wine, and drank it in the room to the point of intoxication. Then she took off her clothes and went to sleep. At about 10 p.m., tea servants Chen Arong and Shen Ayi entered the room to check on her, as they were concerned that the female guest might vomit while drunk and soil the bedding. Unexpectedly, they saw that Yufen's expression had changed and her breathing was short. Realizing that something was wrong, they reported it to the front desk and had her carried to the Brothers Hospital for treatment. According to Dr. Zhu's diagnosis, Yufen had taken sleeping pills and raw opium, and had swallowed them along with sorghum wine, resulting in severe poisoning and little hope of survival. He reported it to the First Police Station, and police were dispatched to investigate. It was then learned that Yufen was a maid in the home of Dr. Zhu. Two suicide notes were recovered, one addressed to her mother and one to her master and mistress. The notes contained many hidden feelings, and the reason for the suicide seemed to be an affair with the master, which led to her being abandoned.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Anti-Disaster Drill at the South Railway Station Yesterday Morning <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Enemy Planes Attacking and Thugs Disturbing Were Not Successful</p>
<p>Employees Were Very Tired, Drill Suspended This Morning</p>
<p>In order to prevent disasters and protect railway traffic, the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration carried out prevention measures in the event of a major disaster on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo lines respectively. Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and other stations have all completed the drills one after another. As a result, the performance evaluations were all good. Yesterday morning, the Shanghai South Railway Station conducted a major anti-disaster drill from 3:00 am to 4:00 am, lasting one hour. The most serious moment was the twenty minutes from 3:30 am to 3:50 am. At this time, the South Railway Station was in a state of extreme horror, as if a major disaster had struck. The details of the drill are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e128">Full Mobilization and Division of Responsibilities <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>At about 3:00 am yesterday morning, the Shanghai South Railway Station anti-disaster drill was held. Participants included all railway police officers of the Shanghai-Jiaxing Section of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Police Department, and all railway police officers and workers of the Engineering Section, Mechanical Section, and Health Section of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway. Zhong Wenjiang, the captain of the Shanghai-Jiaxing Section, served as the chief instructor, and Han Shangying, the deputy captain of the Shanghai-Jiaxing Section, Luo Shenghao, an engineer of the Engineering Section, Shi Ziyu, an engineer of the Mechanical Section, and Zheng Binshi, a doctor of the Health Section, served as deputy instructors. Zhou Binwu, the stationmaster, was in charge of train management, Liang Peigen, the director of the Locomotive Section, was in charge of lighting management, and Ma Xiaoping, the director of the Railway Police Department, and Li Jing, the director of the Ximen Public Security Bureau, and Yuan, the inspector of the Gaochang Temple Public Security Bureau, all came to visit.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Purpose of the Drill is to Prepare for Contingencies <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>When the Xinsheng News Agency reporter drove to the South Railway Station, the entire station was still peaceful as if nothing had happened. Han Shangying, the deputy captain of the Shanghai-Jiaxing Section, greeted reporters from various newspapers who participated in the disaster prevention news work and reported the significance of this railway administration's disaster prevention drill, so that if there were any omissions in the drill, they could be corrected and compensated in advance to avoid being caught unprepared in the event of a real disaster. The Xinsheng News Agency reporter then went to inspect the vicinity of the station. The South Railway Station in the middle of the night was silent. Only a thatched hut was pre-built behind the station for use as a burning target for aircraft bombing.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Alarms Ring Repeatedly, Suddenly Tense <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>At 3:00 am, the Shanghai-Jiaxing Section of the Railway Police stationed in the office had slight movements, and then the rescue team of the Health Section, the engineering team of the Engineering Section, the Mechanical Section, etc. of the South Railway Station also dispatched one after another. At 3:25 am, the alarm bell at the southern end of the station suddenly rang, indicating that the station authorities had received an alarm from Jiaxing, assuming that the enemy's enemy plane had advanced eastward to attack the Shanghai South Railway Station. At this time, the personnel dispatched were also suddenly tense. At 3:30 am, the second alarm bell rang again, meaning that the enemy plane had passed Jiaxing and was gradually approaching. Martial law was suddenly declared within half a mile of the station, and the railway police were all over the station, with overlapping police posts in important places. The fire brigade also crawled out to extinguish the fire. At 3:30 am, the third alarm bell rang urgently, as if the enemy's enemy plane was approaching even closer. All the lights in the station suddenly went out, and the whistles sounded one after another. The personnel participating in the disaster prevention issued an emergency mobilization order in the darkness. At this time, the South Railway Station had fallen into an extremely terrifying state.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Terror Arrives, Rescue is Rapid <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>At this time, the chief and deputy instructors at the station scattered with their teams, intending to assume that there were three enemy aircraft, two coming from the south and one from the east, dropping incendiary bombs near the station. Before long, the thatched house at the back door of the South Railway Station on the road in front of the station caught fire, and the flames soared into the sky for a while, almost causing a catastrophe. Fortunately, the railway police and fire brigade rushed to the scene and bravely rescued the fire with fire extinguishers, sandbags, and other fire-fighting equipment. It was extinguished in only a quarter of an hour, and other places were fortunately not burned. At this time, the aircraft bombings were even more intense, and the situation in the entire station was extremely chaotic. The injured were rushed to the temporary hospital by the rescue team with stretchers to take first aid medicine and treatment. The thugs also took advantage of the chaos to carry out sabotage. As a result, the tracks were destroyed and dismantled, two thugs were captured and tied up, and the locomotive for repairing the tracks was also driven out of the garage, carrying the engineering team and various track repair materials, and stopped at the destroyed place. The entire team started to repair the tracks. The speed of the engineering effect was unexpected. The train passed through the section of the tracks in only five minutes. At this time, another group of thugs rushed into the station to carry out sabotage, overturning objects and setting fires. Fortunately, the railway police were brave and alert and were able to capture all of them. The arrested thugs were reported to the chief instructor. Li Wenjin and Dai Shiguang, two thugs who destroyed the tracks, and Shi Wenbo and Zhang Shouqin, thugs who broke into the station and caused chaos, were captured. After interrogation, they were handed over to the custody.</p>

<p>The enemy aircraft, failing to drop bombs, fled to the southwest. Thus, the scene of a major disaster came to an end, and the electric lights in the entire station were as bright as ever, and order and traffic gradually returned. The Xinsheng News Agency reporter met with the chief instructor Zhong Wenhong at the station again, saying that the exercise tonight had achieved unexpected results, so the two exercises this morning and tomorrow will not be held again.</p>

<p>The Xinsheng News Agency reporter learned from the Railway Administration yesterday morning that the Shanghai South Railway Station conducted an air defense drill yesterday morning and originally planned to hold it officially this morning. However, the results of the test run were very good, and all the staff were very tired after working hard. Moreover, the Railway Administration has been very busy with various tasks recently, so it was decided to suspend the exercise. It is rumored that the Shanghai North Railway Station will hold a regular air defense drill, but it has also been decided to abandon it.</p>

The red atmosphere has ceased, and the people are relieved. At the same time, the national foundation has been consolidated, and a grand gathering should be held to celebrate. It is hereby decided to convene all subordinate party branches and seafarer organizations at 9:00 am on the 10th of this month in the auditorium of the party headquarters to hold a celebration.

<h3 id="e143">Today's Commemoration of the Zhaohe Uprising <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Held at the City Party Headquarters at 10:00 AM</p>
<p>Today marks the 19th anniversary of the Zhaohe warship uprising. All sectors of the city's populace have scheduled a commemorative meeting for 10:00 AM today at the Grand Auditorium of the City Party Headquarters in Fenglin Bridge. The City Party Headquarters yesterday issued a special notice to all city agencies, schools, and organizations, requesting them to send two representatives each, with letters of participation. Standing Committee Member Tong Xingbai has been designated chairman. At the same time, Yang Hu, then Chief of the City Security Department who participated in the uprising, has been invited to attend and report on the situation at the time. The Chinese Concession military and police agencies, in addition to strictly implementing winter defense measures and maintaining security, have added extra protection. The City Party Headquarters, to ensure that all sectors understand the significance of the uprising, has also issued a public notice, which states:</p>
<p>The Zhaohe Warship and Mr. Yang Xiaotian at the Time of the Uprising</p>
<p>The image shows Yang Hu, acting Naval Commander in 1915 during the Zhaohe Incident, leading troops to occupy the warship. After occupying the ship, he raised the party flag at the masthead and gave a speech. The left corner shows a recent photo of Mr. Yang.</p>
<p>Today is the anniversary of the Zhaohe Uprising. The Special Party Headquarters of the City Security Department considers this event to be the herald of the campaign to overthrow Yuan Shikai and protect the nation, and the precursor to the rebuilding of the Republic. Furthermore, Mr. Yang Xiaotian, the Standing Committee Member of the association and Chief of the City Security Department, was the commander who led party members to seize the Zhaohe warship on that day. The tragic and ardent events certainly have much to tell. Therefore, at 10:00 AM today, representatives of the teams will be gathered for a commemorative ceremony, and Mr. Yang will be invited to attend and report on the uprising to invigorate the revolutionary spirit and achieve the practical effect of saving the nation. According to Mr. Yang Xiaotian, Chief of the City Security Department, who personally participated in the Zhaohe Uprising, the Zhaohe Incident has passed many years. Thinking back, the impression is profoundly deep. He is specially publishing commemorative remarks to record his long-held sentiments. The record of his commemorative remarks is as follows:</p>
<p>Today is the nineteenth anniversary of the Zhaohe warship uprising. I have the honor of being one of the participants in the uprising and battle. As this important anniversary approaches, all compatriots and comrades across the country who are concerned about this history of the uprising may hope for my personal account. However, the details of the Zhaohe commemoration have been briefly recorded in party history and scattered in newspapers. Moreover, there has been narration every time we have held a commemoration. Therefore, I do not wish to add much more. What I will discuss today will focus on three aspects: the motives, effects, and evolving significance of the Zhaohe Uprising. ㈠ Motives: The general view of the motives for the Zhaohe Uprising is that it was a struggle by our party against Yuan Shikai's imperial ambitions and in support of democratic politics. This is, of course, a factual account of the matter. However, I would like to add that the overthrow of the empire and the support for democracy are merely the immediate causes that constitute this historical fact. There is an even longer historical development relationship at play. Since the philosopher Bacon advocated scientific practice in Europe, the social way of life has changed drastically from the past. England was the first to bear the brunt of this change, forming the famous industrial revolution in history. As a result, the surge in the economy influenced the organization of its political system. This is known to all who study world cultural history. It is consistent with what the historian Wells said in his European history regarding the evolution of monarchy and republic: [Political changes and intellectual development both increased, and are subtly related to science. Mankind has a growing tendency to want to consider life based on common fundamental desires and unsatisfied enjoyments, and to explore the relationships of life in a broader sense, serving and enjoying.] This is one aspect. At the same time, as the wheel of the era advanced into the twentieth century, industry in Europe and the United States had developed to a dangerous point where it was necessary to invade others. In fact, other industrially backward countries in the world, such as Africa and Asia, immediately became the grazing grounds for industrialized nations. They plundered and seized to the extreme. Moreover, the biologist Darwin advocated the dangerous theories of [survival of the fittest and the strong preying on the weak]. The world was in turmoil, and there was no end in sight. This is the second aspect. On the other hand, although we have had thousands of years of emperors, historical records still record the public ownership of the world by Yao and Shun, the utopian society of the Lao and Mo schools, and the Confucian political theories of [the people are the most important] and [the virtuous should rule]. Our people live in this kind of historical culture, which will naturally evolve into an unknown political system in the future. This is the third aspect. Furthermore, in the West, there is the practical experiment of the French republican political system, the democratic governance of the United States in the New World, and the constitutionalism of England, Germany, Italy, Japan, and other countries. All of these are the beginnings of democracy. This is the fourth aspect. These four causes together constitute the Three Principles of the People—nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood—the doctrine of national salvation of the late Premier. Therefore, our party must eliminate all those who oppose or contradict this doctrine as opportunities arise. Therefore, Yuan Shikai's imperial ambitions are naturally not to be tolerated. To put it bluntly, it is our party's late Premier using his Three Principles of the People to eliminate those reactionary factions who have already formed. Therefore, I state that the Zhaohe Uprising, in addition to eliminating the already established traitors, also contains a distant historical development. ㈡ Effects: Those who discuss the history of our party's revolution have often considered the Zhaohe Uprising to be the preface to the rebuilding of the Republic, with the Yunnan Uprising as the rearguard. Some even believe that the Zhaohe Uprising was the prelude to the success of the Northern Expedition and the unification of the country by our party. In my opinion, the above points are only inferences based on the evolution of the revolutionary battles. To be realistic, the victory of revolutionary theory is still important. The victory of military force is only temporary, deformed, and not a true victory. This is not only true today, but is also clearly revealed in ancient history, both Chinese and foreign. If the revolution relied entirely on military force, then our party's initial strength was like a drop in the ocean. To use it to fight against the Qing Dynasty was like a mantis trying to stop a cart. However, the reason why we were able to overthrow the Qing Dynasty in the end was that revolutionary theory prevailed. Furthermore, the Zhaohe Uprising not only dealt a fatal blow to domestic</p>
<p>reactionaries, but also contained the meaning of international resistance. When the traitor Yuan Shikai was self-respecting, he knew that he was offending the public, so he signed the Twenty-One Demands, which would destroy the country, by means of treason. The late Premier led our party comrades to call out, and the revolutionary tide of Huangpu rose. The traitor Yuan Shikai, who sold the country and harmed the people, died in shame because of this, and the Twenty-One Demands were shattered in their legal effect by the sound of the Zhaohe cannons. This is why I say that the effect of the Zhaohe Uprising, in addition to what is generally recognized, also carries the international rejection of war and the victory of revolutionary theory. ㈢ Evolving Significance: The significance of revolution contains two principles: destruction and construction. Destruction is certainly not easy, but construction is even more difficult. The late Premier has explained these fundamental principles to our compatriots and comrades in detail. Today, as we commemorate the Zhaohe Uprising, we are truly admiring the bloodshed and destruction of the martyrs. The path was difficult, and cutting through the thorns was not easy. This is certainly essential. However, as time passes and years change, it is not enough to only admire or imitate the destructive spirit of the martyrs. Now that the government is unified and the military period is over, there are many things to be done. In this solemn commemoration of the martyrs, our compatriots and comrades should, based on the sages who sacrificed their lives for righteousness, strive for the grand plan of building a hundred things. This is the evolution of the meaning of revolution. The lost territory in the Northeast has not been recovered, the Naval Conference has collapsed, and the disarmament conference is even more of a castle in the air. The economic downturn and the people's hardship are unprecedented in human history. I deeply hope that my compatriots and comrades will have great insight and, under the leadership of the central government, work hard and prepare to be martyrs who defend the nation and uphold the doctrine, so that we will be worthy of our lives. The righteous act of the Zhaohe Uprising, which the late Premier commanded on this day nineteen years ago, will coexist with heaven and earth. Although I am not talented, I am willing to encourage us together.</p>

<h3 id="e146">The Vice President Left for Europe Yesterday Afternoon <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Mayor Wu and others went to see him off</p>
<p>Dr. Espinoza, Vice President of Nicaragua, received a warm welcome from all parties in our country during his visit to China.

However, the Shanghai Times reported last night, citing a Beijing dispatch, that Li Dijun, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, replied that this matter had indeed been discussed.</p>
<h3 id="e147">The U.S. Senatorial Inspection Group Passed Through Shanghai This Morning to Go to the Philippines <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The Special Commissioner from the Philippines Came to Shanghai to Greet Them</p>
<p>According to the Ta Mei Wan Pao, the inspection group consisting of U.S. Senators Tydings, McKellar, Gillet, and Magill, and Representative Miller, plans to go to the Philippine Islands to inspect the commercial situation and policies, as well as the changes that the Philippine Independence Act may cause. They will pass through Shanghai on the Asia Maru on the 5th (today) morning, stay briefly, and then continue south on the original ship. Philippine legislator Rodriguez has come to Shanghai to greet them. It is heard that Rodriguez was ordered by the Philippine sugar industry to discuss everything with the inspection group during the voyage from Shanghai to Manila. Because sugar is one of the Philippines' main exports, future Philippine-U.S. relations when the Philippines becomes independent will change, and the sugar industry is an issue that should be discussed. This inspection was prepared by Senator Hayden, who was sent by the U.S. government to the Philippines between July and August this year to prepare everything.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Two More Ships of the Sanbei Company Encountered Danger <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>But Both Were Safe</p>
<p>Waking Lion Aground The Waking Lion ship of the Sanbei Company originally sailed the Yangtze River. Recently, due to the large number of ships on the Yangtze River, it went to Haizhou to load salt. This time, it was transporting a large amount of salt from Shierxu to Hankou. Now is the winter season, and the Yangtze River is receding, making navigation difficult. The ship, at 1:00 AM yesterday morning, while approaching Datong, ran aground due to fog and the pilot's negligence. It was fully loaded with salt, and the draft was deep, causing the ship to sink into the shallows and unable to escape for a time. Yesterday, the company received the news and telegraphed all of its upriver and downriver ships on the Yangtze River to assist in towing it when passing by. The hull of the Waking Lion was not damaged. Once the tide rises, it is hoped that it can get out of the shallows.</p>
<p>Dragon Mountain Encountered Wind The Dragon Mountain ship of the Sanbei Company was going from Shanghai to Qinhuangdao to load coal. However, there was a hurricane in the sea area in recent days. The ship encountered a hurricane attack at around the morning yesterday when it was near Sheshan. At that time, the ship owner telegraphed for help and was assisted by a Chinese Navy warship. When reporters inquired, the person in charge of the company said that the Dragon Mountain encountering wind was not very dangerous. After the wind passes, it is hoped that it can sail again. The hull was not grounded on rocks.</p>
<h3 id="e149">After the Taishan Ship Accident <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The crew members' families are demanding compensation</p>
<p>After the Sanbei Company's Taishan ship accident was confirmed, there were a total of 51 employees on board who were killed. The British Consulate in this port yesterday received a telegram from a British warship stating that two more bodies had been recovered, and that the rest were feared to be submerged inside the ship, unable to float to the surface for the time being. The families of the deceased employees went to the company yesterday to demand compensation, and the situation was very tragic.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Truth About the Disaster <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The Taishan ship set sail from Qingdao at 7:00 AM on the 27th of last month, loaded with 3,050 tons of coal, plus coal for the ship's own use. The load had reached the safety line, and the ship's draft was too deep, reducing the hull's buoyancy. It would have been very dangerous even without wind and waves. The ship encountered a hurricane about 14 hours into the sea voyage from Qingdao. At that time, the China Merchants Bureau's Yongji ship was sailing ahead and also encountered a hurricane. The shipmaster of the Yongji quickly reduced the speed of his ship and sailed with the wind and waves. As a result, it was able to get out of the wind circle and fortunately escaped. The ship following behind was the Taishan, but it was already dark and the ship name could not be seen. The shipmaster of the Yongji saw that the ship suddenly turned its bow when the hurricane struck. The crew knew that the ship must have had an accident, but they saw the ship send out a distress signal. The Yongji itself had not yet escaped the wind circle and could not go to rescue it. They watched the ship sink, but they did not know its name at the time and could not determine which ship it was. It was not until the Yongji arrived in Shanghai and inquired whether any ships from various companies had not arrived that they learned that the ship that encountered the accident that the Yongji encountered was the Taishan.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning, the families of the ship's crew, sailors, stokers, etc., went to the Sanbei Company on Guangdong Road, supporting the old and carrying the young. They were all wailing and crying loudly, demanding that the company pay compensation. The manager of the company comforted them one by one. Since the crew members were killed, there are regulations in the maritime law. After the company receives an official and confirmed report of the accident, it will be handled according to law. Moreover, the various shipping companies have established precedents for compensating the crew members who died, so the families should not be disappointed. Until 12:00 noon, the crew members' families left in tears.</p>

<p>The China Association of Marine Engineers sent a letter to the Sanbei Company yesterday, stating: "Dear Sirs, We have learned that your company's Taishan ship, which was on its way from Qingdao to Shanghai, has been missing for many days. According to reports, the British warship HMS Peterel has recovered four bodies 140 miles from Qingdao while sailing from Weihaiwei to Shanghai, all of which were carrying Taishan ship lifebuoys. Based on this situation, it is certain that the ship has been wrecked. The families of the crew members who served on the ship, upon hearing this news, have been gathering at our association day and night, supporting the old and carrying the young, crying out to heaven and earth, asking us to uphold justice and requesting that we send personnel to lead them to your company to negotiate in person. The tragic situation is unbearable to describe. According to our information, on the 26th of this month, in addition to the Taishan, your company also had the Shengan ship sailing from Qingdao to Shanghai. Although it set sail three hours before the Taishan, the actual speed of the Shengan was inferior to the Taishan. Why did one arrive safely in Shanghai, while the other encountered a strange accident midway? This is worth investigating. We urge your company to thoroughly investigate to clarify the truth and avoid any ambiguity. As for the aftermath, the most important point at present is that you should quickly send a ship to search along the route and salvage the bodies, including those recovered by the British warship, and transport them to Shanghai together for identification. You should also prepare coffins and provide generous burials to comfort the deceased. As for the issue of compensation, as your company is a giant in the shipping industry, you should be extra generous to ensure that the families of the deceased can live in peace and avoid the risk of freezing and starvation. We hope that your company will respond quickly upon receipt of this letter to avoid the families waiting for a long time and any unexpected events occurring, which would be inconvenient. We are sending this letter to inform you and ask you to investigate."</p>

<p>The types of modern Chinese gold, silver, and copper coins are numerous, surpassing even stamps. Taking the ten-cash copper coin as an example, there are no fewer than several thousand types. Unfortunately, there are few researchers, unlike the popularity of stamp collecting. Messrs. Wang Ping have been collecting these types of coins for more than ten years and have a considerable collection. In order to arouse the interest of the people in coin collecting and to allow fellow enthusiasts to observe, it has been decided to hold a public exhibition at the New World Hotel on Nanjing Road on the 8th and 9th of this month to promote it.

<p>The borrowing banks will remit the full amount before the end of the month</p>
<p>The banking syndicate is organized with China Communications as its representative</p>
<p>The New Voice Society reported that the Zhejiang Provincial Government mortgaged 5 million yuan face value of local public bonds to China and other banks for 3 million yuan. After the contract was negotiated and finalized, it was sent to the banks for signing. The signing was completed yesterday, and it was decided that the full amount would be remitted once before the end of this month. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Apportioned to Each Bank Zhejiang public bonds with a face value of 5 million yuan are mortgaged to banks at 60% for a loan of 3 million yuan. The borrowing banks are China, Communications, Shanghai, Zhejiang Industrial, Zhejiang Xingye, Zhejiang Local, Jincheng, Zhongnan, Continental, Yanye, Tongshang, Kenye, Siming, Agricultural and Industrial, China Industrial, China National Products, and other banks, as well as the Four-Bank Savings Association, totaling 20.

<p>Special Report</p>
<h3 id="e161">International Situation and China's Way Out by Li Fusun <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Li Fusun, a leader in the financial world, traveled abroad to Europe and America for inspection during the summer of this year. After returning to China, various groups and newspaper reporters successively requested lectures and the publication of his opinions. Mr. Li, due to the complexity of his affairs, was unable to respond to each invitation individually. Therefore, he entrusted the publication of the following document to satisfy the earnest expectations of all parties and to spare those who wished to hear Mr. Li's views the labor of traveling. This will, no doubt, be welcomed by readers.</p>
<p>International conflicts, after the relief and discharge of the last World War, had temporarily returned to peace and harmony, and in their place, various international cooperative movements arose. However, before long, the world economic panic occurred, which has lasted for five years from 1929 to the present. The advance of the panic has not diminished in the slightest. In the process of the panic, countries have sought their own salvation. On the one hand, they have built high tariff barriers to prevent the intrusion of foreign goods, and on the other hand, they have reduced the value of their currencies to seize overseas markets. As economic warfare has intensified, the momentum of nationalism has risen, and the so-called international cooperation has once again become a bubble. The failure of past disarmament conferences, the futility of world economic conferences, and the current stalemate of the naval disarmament preparatory conference are all extremely obvious facts.</p>
<p>Markets are limited, but the development of productivity is advancing day by day. If advanced countries only possess domestic markets, they are insufficient to absorb their huge productivity, and to seize overseas markets is nothing more than treating neighbors as cesspools. The countries seek to retaliate against each other, which only makes the markets narrower and sales more sluggish. Using this to overcome the panic, it is no wonder that the panic remains, and international conflicts grow daily, with even the worry of a re-enactment of a world war.</p>
<p>Looking at the economic conditions of European and American countries, the relatively stable one is Great Britain. British industry and commerce have a long history and a solid foundation, and the extent of its colonies far exceeds other countries. Since the Ottawa Conference, the subordinate countries within the British Empire have further established close ties to prevent the outflow of rights and interests. British colonial policy has always emphasized tolerance, and other countries could still get a piece of the pie in colonial trade. However, in recent years, due to the urgency of self-preservation, it has become necessary to gradually squeeze out the influence of other countries outside the British Empire. It is precisely because of this change in policy that Great Britain has been able to compensate for a portion of the losses in foreign trade by increasing trade with its colonies and domestic trade, thereby alleviating its internal panic. Its sound financial system is sufficient to calm people's hearts and influence national policy, enabling the entire country, from top to bottom, to calmly deal with the turbulent waves with a gentle and steady policy, achieving results that others cannot match.</p>
<p>Among the British industrial sectors, the most unfortunate is the textile industry. The desolation in the Lancashire area remains unchanged. This is because the textile industry is one of the light industries, easily imitated by latecomer countries and colonies. The development of the textile industries in China and India is a crisis for the British textile industry, but its fatal wound is the rapid advancement of Japanese textile technology and its low wages. When we observe the impact of Japanese-owned yarn factories on Chinese-owned yarn factories, we can see what kind of impact the high wages in Britain have suffered.</p>
<p>In these difficult times, how should we conduct ourselves? When nationalism is rampant, hoping to assist China's development through international cooperation is probably a futile dream. Since the September 18th Incident, the balance of power in the Far East has been broken, and international cooperation schemes are plagued by many difficulties and considerations, which may not be allowed by the situation. If we want to fight for the survival of the nation, we can only rely on self-reliance and self-rescue. Under the principle of self-reliance and self-rescue, we must especially weigh the priorities and carefully consider the gains and losses. The law should indeed take the strengths of others to supplement our weaknesses, and the application must rely on what we uniquely possess and adapt to what we urgently need. In all measures, we must strive to minimize harms and maximize benefits, and achieve great effects with little effort. Only by exerting all our efforts will we see results. Based on this meaning, there is no doubt that the foundation of the nation should be based on agriculture. The reason why our country has been less affected by the world panic in the past five years is that the maintenance of the silver standard, which has brought us the benefits of collecting revenue, is one of the reasons, but establishing the country on agriculture, with the economic foundation spread in the countryside rather than concentrated in the cities, has prevented the panic's tidal wave from finding its focus of attack, which is a powerful defense. European countries such as Denmark have also experienced less panic for this reason. While the countryside is more resistant to panic, it still relies on the support of national policy to avoid ultimate exhaustion. In recent years, in addition to man-made disasters, natural disasters have increased in our country, and the rural economy has gradually fallen into hardship. Even the annual import of agricultural products, reaching 400 to 500 million yuan, is alarming. Given our country's abundant natural resources, improving agricultural production to achieve self-sufficiency should not be difficult. If this is the case, the most serious trade deficit and financial problems in the national economy can be easily solved, which will not only preserve the existing rural foundation.</p>
<p>Under the policy of emphasizing agriculture, the transportation industry must seek its development. Otherwise, even if production increases, the surplus and deficit will not be balanced, which would be in vain. However, the construction of transportation tools must not go against the policy of emphasizing agriculture. The fundraising for construction expenses must not harm the vitality of the countryside, and the function of transportation tools should be able to undertake the important task of dredging agricultural products. Following these measures, minerals can also be developed along with agricultural products. By taking advantage of the benefits of nature and exhausting the efforts of people, the establishment of the national foundation can be achieved with half the effort and twice the result.</p>
<p>As for industry, existing factories should be vigorously supported and encouraged in various ways. For new industries that are still in the planning stage or require large amounts of capital, it seems better to establish appropriate procedures to welcome the cooperation of foreign capital. Being greedy for more and seeking quick results, and being fond of grand achievements are the biggest weaknesses of our people. For decades, we have only possessed the empty name of maintaining rights and have not received the actual benefits of developing rights and interests. Hiding treasures only teaches thieves, which is disheartening. Based on the above situation, it is feared that even if we gather the manpower and financial resources of the whole country to revitalize the countryside and develop natural resources, the results may still be insufficient. After revitalizing the countryside and developing natural resources, the national foundation will be established, and there will be no need to seek external solutions. If we abandon the near and pursue the far, and divert limited manpower and financial resources to industry, the protection of tariffs will be difficult to ensure, and the improvement of technology cannot be achieved overnight. After the bankruptcy of the countryside, sales will become a problem. Its foundation is so fragile, and to compete with others for a moment's advantage is like hitting a stone with an egg. I fear that we will be stretched on all sides, losing sight of one thing while attending to another, and that both industry and agriculture will fall into ruin. Therefore, I hope that the whole country, from top to bottom, will break free from prejudices, be practical and realistic, and use the limited national power in the most cautious and economical way. The first step is to ensure that the three main agricultural products, rice, wheat, and cotton, are sufficient to meet our needs for food and clothing. The second step is to export what is left over to reduce the trade deficit. If we can do this, the rural economy and its purchasing power will naturally recover, and the exhaustion of inland finance and the depression of cities will naturally disappear. Then, we can use the recovered financial resources to engage in industry, which will be easier and smoother. In short, it is not that I do not consider industry important, but since we cannot take care of everything, it is better to prioritize what is urgent. Here, it is necessary to emphasize that hoping for international cooperation to develop China is one thing, and welcoming foreign capital to cooperate in developing industry is another. Any joint plan among international parties is impossible, while private investment by capitalists from various countries in the nature of simple business investment is very possible. However, in this situation, the principle of self-reliance and self-rescue must still be fully realized. The entire financial industry in the country should unite and organize a sound organization to directly negotiate with financiers and entrepreneurs from various countries, providing them with sufficient assistance and communication. Only when we have a sound organization and strength ourselves, will foreign capitalists be pleased to come to us after hearing about it. We must thoroughly recognize that the investment of foreign capitalists is purely voluntary. If the investment is safe and profitable, they will come without being invited, and it is up to us to make good use of it. If we want to attract huge sums of money based solely on the tongues of one or two lobbyists, I fear that the result will be the opposite.</p>
<p>As for the currency system, the people's understanding of currency is still very immature. The hard currency centrism of the metallist school is still a timely theory in our country. The laws of using artificial methods and political means to control currency, which can barely achieve temporary effects in other countries, have little possibility of being imitated in our country. The recent scheme adopted by our country to impose an active tariff on silver exports is a practical and effective law. As a result, it only makes silver depreciate in international exchange, which is sufficient to prevent the massive export of currency materials and maintain the stability of prices domestically, without any impact on the currency itself, and the foundation of the currency system is firmly unshaken. Here, I hope that domestic scholars will deeply study the domestic situation and national environment, and avoid sensationalist theories to shake people's hearts and cause unnecessary panic. The market will be safe.</p>
<p>Finally, I have an incidental statement to make. My trip abroad was purely a private tour. I am grateful to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for their letters of introduction, which provided many conveniences on the journey. However, I did not assume any formal mission at the beginning. Although the Ministry of Finance instructed me to investigate the currency systems of various countries along the way, at a time when the currency systems of various countries are divorced from the economic field and transferred to political management, what I have seen is only a myriad of laws and regulations, and there are few natural laws of currency that can be imitated, and even fewer that can be studied.</p>

<h3 id="e162">Police File Lawsuit Against Liang Tongfang Case Opened Yesterday <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Liang said that because there were few customers at noon, he went to warn them</p>
<p>If he had the determination to kill, why would he bother to explain?</p>
<p>Liang Tongfang from Shangyu, because he took a bomb to Yuelai South Goods Store on Guangdong Road to warn them not to sell enemy goods, the bomb fell on the counter, causing an explosion. In addition to blowing off Liang's right wrist and two fingers of his left hand, three employees and one customer in the store were slightly injured. Liang was arrested on the spot by the police and sent to the hospital with the injured for treatment. The Public Concession then filed a public lawsuit against Liang for attempted murder under Article 284 of the Criminal Law. After investigation by the First Special District Court, it was determined that Liang had no intention of premeditated murder and was convicted of possessing explosives with intent to commit a crime under Article 200 of the Criminal Law, sentenced to six months imprisonment, and suspended for two years. After Liang was sentenced, the Shangyu Association in Shanghai and others tried to bail him out from the court and sent him to the hospital for treatment. However, the Public Concession was very dissatisfied with the first instance judgment, and the lawyer in charge, Wang Yaotang, filed an appeal with the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court.</p>
<h3 id="e163">File Appeal <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The reasons stated in the appeal were very detailed, generally stating that after Liang Tongfang joined the "Red Exterminating Traitors Group" in Shanghai, he distributed leaflets and sent warning letters to commercial firms rumored to be selling Japanese goods, threatening them with death if they did not comply. According to his confession, he also gave the same warning to Yuelai South Goods Store, and a letter was also sent at the same time. When the police officers went to the defendant's residence to search, they did indeed find the leaflet, indicating that his motive for murder had been established since he joined the illegal organization. Later, because he believed that the warning to Yuelai was ineffective, he gathered his comrades and discussed together in a closed room in the Heming Hotel on how to implement the final step, which was also confessed. After the discussion was settled, at noon on October 19th, he took a very powerful bomb to Yuelai to carry out the murder. After the defendant spoke three or two words with the store employee,</p>
<h3 id="e164">Immediately Throw Bomb <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Causing injury to the store employee and customers. According to the murder charge, intent is a necessary condition, which is clearly stipulated by the law. However, the word "intent" has a certain definition. Article 26 of the Criminal Law stipulates [“Whoever clearly knows the facts constituting the crime and intentionally causes it to occur is intentional.”] Now, the bomb thrown by the defendant is an immediate explosive. Once thrown, its power is great enough to kill many people at the same time, as is known to ordinary people. How could the defendant, who was a soldier and experienced war, not know? Even his confession in the first instance stated that the bomb would explode immediately. Therefore, the defendant knew that the bomb he used was a weapon for murder, which is beyond doubt. According to the defendant's confession, he had removed the safety pin before throwing it, indicating that his determination to kill was consistent from the beginning. Who would believe that he did not intend to kill? Therefore, he was a premeditated murderer, which is beyond doubt. Furthermore, after the defendant was sentenced in the first instance, he published an advertisement in the Shanghai Evening News on November 24th to thank all sectors, which contained</p>
<h3 id="e165">The Phrase "Corpse Admonition" <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Although the original meaning of the phrase "corpse admonition" is to use one's dead body to go to someone else's place to admonish, the circumstances of this case are different from perishing together with others. However, his determination to die can be seen in general. The original judgment tried hard to exonerate the defendant. The reasons for proving that the defendant did not have premeditated murder were: 1) The defendant intended to warn before throwing the bomb; 2) He did not throw the bomb, but slipped; 3) The method of throwing was not enough to cause the death of others. It only knew one thing and did not know the other. The original lawsuit for attempted murder was true and well-founded, and there was no flaw to attack. The original judgment did not impose the appropriate punishment according to the indictment, but avoided the heavier and chose the lighter, and changed the conviction to possession of explosives, sentencing him to six months in prison and then suspending it. In terms of law, there is no justification, and according to past precedents,</p>
<h3 id="e166">Cases Of Same Nature <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>There are those who have been sentenced to twelve years in prison, which is extremely inconsistent with previous examples. Even if the circumstances of the defendant's crime have something to be pitied, one should not distort the law and erase the facts. To allow the people to indulge in their impulses, disregard the law, or even consider it profitable, is a phenomenon that should not exist in a rule-of-law country. Therefore, I request that the original judgment be revoked and that the defendant be punished with the punishment he deserves, etc. Yesterday afternoon, Zhao, Wu, and Zhou, the three judges of the High Court's Second Branch, specially opened a collegial panel to hear the case. Prosecutor Zhong Qing also attended the court to perform his duties. First, Judge Zhao asked Liang Tongfang about his name, origin, age, and residence. Then, Wang Yaotang, the lawyer representing the Public Concession, stated the intention of the appeal, stating that the Public Concession believed that the first-instance judgment of November 17th was wrong. All the reasons for the appeal have been stated in detail in the statement of reasons. Please</p>
<h3 id="e167">Revoke Original Judgement <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>And convict him of attempted premeditated murder in accordance with Article 2824 of the original lawsuit, and submit the Social Evening News, which contains Liang Tongfang's advertisement of thanks to all sectors, as evidence. Judge Zhao then questioned the appellant Liang Tongfang, who stated that he had heard the appeal intention stated by the Public Concession's lawyer, but he had no intention of intentionally injuring anyone. The discussion with his comrades in the Heming Hotel beforehand was also to discuss how to avoid injury, and there was no premeditation on how to injure anyone. Therefore, he decided to go to warn them at noon, because it was lunchtime and there would be few customers. He had sent two letters to Yuelai in advance to warn them, advising them not to sell enemy goods again during this economic panic, which would benefit the enemy. However, the store did not listen, so he took the bomb and went to the store alone to warn them again. Because the store employee did not understand my language, he showed the newspaper with the bomb, and told the colleagues in the store to leave quickly. Unexpectedly, at this moment,</p>
<h3 id="e168">The bomb in his hand <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Suddenly fell on the counter, causing an explosion. If I had premeditated murder, I would have thrown the bomb inside as soon as I entered the store, so why would I bother to speak? And I would not have suffered the misfortune myself. The court then questioned him about the advertisement he posted, saying that there were words in the advertisement such as "unable to commit suicide in the store," which seemed to imply perishing together. Liang immediately replied that the advertisement was posted by the fellow villagers' association, and after I saw it, I posted another advertisement to correct it, so the wording was not my intention, etc. The court determined that the facts of the case had been investigated and clarified, and ordered the debate to begin. The Public Concession's lawyer spoke first, stating that since all the reasons had been explained in detail, he would only use a few words to request that the errors that the Public Concession believed to be in the first-instance judgment be corrected, and that the defendant be convicted of attempted premeditated murder. Then, Ge Zhaoji, Feng Meixue, Feng Buqing, and other three lawyers hired by the Shangyu fellow villagers' association to defend Liang</p>
<h3 id="e169">Sequentially Defended <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Stating that the original judgment was very fair. Although the police still requested that he be punished for attempted premeditated murder, the defendant has now confessed in detail the cause of the bomb explosion, which is sufficient to prove that he did go to warn them at that time and had no intention of hurting anyone. Unfortunately, he lost his hand and fell. Although he had injured people, Liang himself was the most seriously injured. His motive for committing the crime was purely a patriotic heart, aroused by righteous indignation. Therefore, he was willing to sacrifice himself in the hope of awakening the traitors and making them aware. The highest principle of the country's creation of laws and punishing criminals is to make the offenders change their ways and do good, and not to fall into the criminal law again. The defendant is now disabled, and he is actually unable to continue to commit illegal acts. From now on, he will have the heart to love the country, but he will not be able to work. I would like to ask the presiding judge to forgive the circumstances and still maintain the original judgment and reject the Public Concession's appeal. After the debate was over, Judge Zhao announced that the sentence would be announced on the afternoon of the 11th of this month, and Liang Tongfang was still allowed to be released on the original bail.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Various yarn factories oppose the increase of the unified tax and send representatives to Beijing to petition again <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Guo Shun and four others will depart tonight</p>
<p>Since the national Chinese yarn factories learned that the Ministry of Finance intended to levy a unified tax on cotton yarn, they convened an emergency representative meeting of national yarn industry leaders to discuss countermeasures. They all believed that the yarn industry was already difficult to maintain under the pressure, how could it bear additional burdens? It was resolved to send representatives to Beijing to petition the relevant ministries and departments to cancel this proposal. The government authorities agreed to submit it to the Central Political Council for review and amendment. So far, there has been no reply. The yarn factories have become increasingly anxious, and at the previous regular meeting of the Yarn Association, they raised the issue for discussion again and decided to send representatives Guo Shun, Nie Lusheng, Liu Jingji, Zhang Zemin, etc. to Beijing to petition again to achieve the goal of cancellation. If it is unsuccessful, they plan to petition at the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee so that the future of the yarn industry will not be in a situation of being "kicked when it's down". The above representatives are scheduled to take the Beijing-Shanghai night express train to Beijing at 11:00 tonight (5th).</p>

<h3 id="e172">International Trade Bureau Introduces National Products <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>The United States Needs Hair Brushes, Flannel Pajamas</p>
<p>Germany Needs Raw Materials Such As Wool, Camel Hair</p>
<p>According to the International Trade Bureau yesterday, the German Aiwarte Baolai Company needs raw wool and camel hair, and the American Southern Import Company needs daily necessities. The following is a record of the goods needed. The northwestern provinces of our country are rich in wool. Every year, it is transported from the Ping-Sui Railway to Tianjin, and after being sorted and cleaned, it is exported to European and American countries, and the number is quite large. According to the statistics of 1933, the output of goat hair was 15,807 piculs, worth 1,599,032 taels of silver, sheep wool was 225,261 piculs, worth 11,522,891 taels of silver, and camel hair was 15,279 piculs, worth 1,827,103 taels of silver, accounting for a considerable position in foreign trade. The wool produced in our country has slightly coarser fibers than that produced in Australia, and can be used to weave inferior wool fabrics, blankets, felts, etc. Now, the German Liupse City Aiwarte Baolai Company has sent a letter requesting Peruvian wool, Angora goat hair, camel hair, and waste wool left over after combing machines have worked. If each exporter wishes to export the above-mentioned goods abroad, they can send a letter to the Bureau for introduction. In addition, the American Atie Lantai City Southern Import Company specializes in import and export businesses and has a sales office in the city. It has sent a letter to purchase jewelry boxes, hairbrushes, toothbrushes, socks, flannel pants and pajamas, etc. If each manufacturer wishes to sell to the country, they can send a letter to the Bureau for introduction.</p>

<p>Birthday Funds and Gifts Donated to Fudan and Hunan Universities</p>
<p>Benefiting Impoverished Students and Cultivating Social Talents</p>
<p>The mother of Yu Jichuan, Director of the Hunan Construction Department, and Yu Nanqiu, Dean of the Faculty of Arts of Fudan University, Madam Peng, celebrated her 70th birthday on January 24, 1935. Because of the difficult times and the people's hardships, the Madam did not want to spend too much. She instructed her sons and grandchildren to prepare a birthday celebration, and donated all the funds prepared for the birthday and the gifts from relatives and friends to Fudan University and Hunan University as scholarships to help impoverished students who are diligent in their studies, so as to cut down on the extravagant waste and transfer it to the needs of national talent cultivation. Shao Lizi, Chen Lifu, Shi Ying, He Jian, Zhang Gongquan, Chen Guangfu, and other celebrities initiated the collection of birthday gifts from all parties, and proposed to delete all cumbersome procedures and convert them into cash, which will be sent to the Yu's birthday gift collection offices of various banks in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Hunan before the birthday period. In this city, the Trust Department of the Bank of Shanghai and the Accounting Office of Fudan University will collect the money on behalf of the family. After the money is collected, it will be remitted to the two universities to be used as free tuition fees. Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang specially presented plaques with the words "Honest, Peaceful, Kind, and Virtuous" to commend them. The Yu brothers, Fan Chuan, is currently a senator of the Military Senate of the National Government, and Zan Chuan, is currently the general manager of the Yongli Chemical Company in Tianjin. The Madam's grandsons, Guo Qi and Jing Yi, graduated from the University of Birmingham in England and have now returned to China one after another. Shi Jiao is studying at the University of Michigan in the United States. The family is full of talented people and has extensive social connections. Now they are able to abolish cumbersome procedures and serve as a public welfare project for society, with broad vision and far-reaching intentions, and their virtues and benefits are immeasurable. Not only can they serve their parents and cultivate their ambitions, but they can also advocate for social good deeds.</p>
<h3 id="e174">&lt;Purpose of the Survey P]　　During the past month, I (referring to myself, Jing Jun) have visited important cities in the five provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Shaanxi, Hubei, and Hunan, such as Beiping, Tianjin, Xi'an, Hankou, Changsha, Xuzhou, and other places. The purpose of this survey was to determine, amid the current economic downturn, whether there is a chance for the revival of Chinese national products. In each place I visited, I made sure to first inquire in detail about the situation from important local industrialists and merchants. I then visited local factories, construction sites, transportation facilities, municipal works, and researched various aspects related to national products. Therefore, although this trip was short, I gained a lot and am willing to share what I know with my fellow advocates of national products as a relevant reference. <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>A Promising Future</p>
<p>The position of national products in North China has already seen significant development. Various general industries and small factories are gradually flourishing. People's practical skills are also progressing compared to the past. This is due to the combined efforts of all parties. Take cigarettes as an example: in the past, they were entirely under the influence of foreign merchants, but that is no longer the case. For example, our company's Ginseng brand is now enjoyed by the public and will soon form a competitive position against imported goods. The same can be said for other products. Xi'an has been identified by the national products industry and the banking sector as the central point for developing the Northwest. Future development is not far off. The Central China market is also optimistic. All parties have a deep understanding of national products. Even before the original economic strength has fully recovered, the important hub of the Yangtze River basin is still firmly held due to the joint efforts of the government and the people to seek prosperity. In summary, there are three impressions gained from this trip: (1) the government authorities are quite serious about promoting national products, (2) they are willing to support them with real strength, and (3) the people are mostly able to support national products. In addition, if the national products industry can put more effort into research in manufacturing and consider the psychology of consumers, then the day of the revival of national products is at hand.</p>
<p>Jin Ai-ru Stole Important Items from Safe Deposit Box</p>
<p>Transferred from Shanghai Bank to Zhejiang Industrial Bank</p>
<p>Account Name Unchanged, Discovery Due to Change Notification</p>
<p>Hu Dunyi, courtesy name Boyi, a consultant to the Jiangxi Provincial Relief Committee and a standing committee member of the Jiangxi Charity Federation, previously stored gold jewelry and other items worth over ten thousand yuan in safe deposit box number 3394 at the Shanghai Bank. Recently, Hu came to Shanghai with his nephew, Jin Ai-ru. Unexpectedly, Jin stole the keys and seals to Hu's safe deposit box and secretly opened the box at the Shanghai Bank, taking out all the items and transferring them to safe deposit box number 401 at the Zhejiang Industrial Bank. The account name remained Hu Boyi, but the address was written as his original residence at 47 Land Temple, Jiangxi. Recently, the new building of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank was completed, and the entire bank moved into the new premises. The head office notified all safe deposit box holders to change to new boxes before December 10. Jin was also notified. Although the location was Jin's residence, the account name was still Hu Boyi. The postal workers, knowing Hu's address, saw that the address and name did not match and assumed that the sender had written the address incorrectly. They sent the notice directly to Hu's residence. Hu opened the letter and learned about the matter. He immediately commissioned lawyer Fan Gang to report to the Old Zhabei Police Station. Detective Kraiden went to the Zhejiang Industrial Bank and opened safe deposit box number 401. The important gold jewelry was gone, and only miscellaneous items worth five to six hundred yuan were found. They were taken back to the police station. Yesterday morning, the items were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Zhu Chenming explained the situation, stating that the complainant, Hu Boyi, was on his way from Nanchang to Shanghai and that Ai-ru had not yet been apprehended. He requested permission to temporarily store the seized items at the police station. Judge Yinghua immediately approved, instructing that the seized items be temporarily stored at the police station according to the inventory.</p>
<p>Workers and Shoemakers Feud, Gathering Crowds and Wielding Weapons</p>
<p>Xu Dechao Violently Pushed a Western Constable</p>
<p>Mastermind Gu Shuliang Arrested</p>
<p>Xu Shanjin, a leather shoemaker from Sicang Lane, Tokyo Road, West Shanghai, has a stall repairing leather shoes there. On the 27th of last month, Gu Shuliang, an Anhui worker from Maofeng Flour Mill at 25 Moganshan Road, brought two pairs of leather shoes to be repaired. At the time, the price was set at 12 cents. On the 30th, when Gu went to Xu's stall to pick up the shoes, he only offered 11 cents. Xu refused, leading to an argument and then a fight. Gu was beaten and injured in the eye. The police arrived and took both parties to the police station, where they were each fined 5 cents. As a result, Gu harbored resentment and sought revenge. He gathered fellow workers from the mill, about three to four hundred people, and on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, at 1:45 PM, they each carried real knives, guns, iron bars, and wooden rulers, preparing to cause trouble for Xu Shanjin. However, because there were so many people, the commotion reached the lane, and the Putuo Road Police Station was informed. Fearing a large-scale riot, the station immediately ordered constable number 25 and Chinese constables numbers 3879 and 2271, among others, to rush to Macau Road and Moganshan Road by motorcycle to suppress the crowd. When the crowd saw the Chinese and Western constables, they fled in all directions. However, Xu Dechao and Liu Wenxiu, natives of Anhui, were fearless and dared to resist. Xu violently pushed the Western constable, and Liu pulled out a bayonet to attack. Fortunately, the blade was blunt and only cut the leather glove, so no injury was sustained. As a result, in addition to Xu and Liu being arrested, accomplices Cai Zichu and Zhang Rongzhang were also apprehended. Cai was holding a long gun, and Zhang was holding a wooden stick. They were all taken to the police station and detained. They confessed that Gu was the mastermind. Detective lawyer Zhang Tianyin of the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court presented the case. Xu Shanjin and his apprentice Li Chunshan also filed a report, proving everything. When questioned, the defendants were evasive and hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend them. Judge Liu Yugui reviewed the confession and ordered Gu, Xu, and Liu to be remanded in custody. Cai and Zhang were each released on 100 yuan bail pending sentencing.</p>
<p>Polish Man Kept Dangerous Explosives at Home</p>
<p>Sent by a Russian Friend for Safekeeping</p>
<p>Refused to Disclose Their Purpose</p>
<p>Police Believe It Is of Great Importance</p>
<p>Around 4 PM on the day before yesterday, the Hongkou Police Station received a report that a Polish man named Li Zifo Sikorski at 659 Broadway Road was keeping explosives. Chinese and Western detectives were dispatched and found a large package of red explosives. He was immediately arrested. He confessed that his Russian friend, Bo Li Lai Fosikai, had asked him to keep them temporarily. Detectives rushed to 203 Tangshan Road and apprehended Bo, bringing him back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Lawyer Li Zhishan of the Public Works Department requested that the explosives, currently stored at the police station, not be brought to court and requested an adjournment. When questioned, Li Zifo Sikorski confessed that Bo had brought the explosives, saying they were pigment, and had asked him to keep them the day before yesterday and could take them away at any time. Bo Li Lai Fosikai confessed that he had asked Li to keep the explosives because his own house was small and near a stove, which was very dangerous. He was evasive about the purpose of the explosives. Lawyer Li said that the case was of great importance and needed to be thoroughly investigated. Judge Xiao Xiefen ordered them to remain in custody and rescheduled the hearing.</p>

<p>Apprentice Died Tragically After Being Pushed into the Huangpu River</p>
<p>The District Court Prosecutor's Office Clearly Filed a Public Prosecution After Investigation</p>
<p>Witness Testimony Vividly Depicted the Scene of Being Pushed into the River</p>
<p>The Deceased's Family Filed a Private Prosecution, and the Hearing Concluded Yesterday</p>
<p>Xu Binrong, a native of Yin County, Ningbo, is 58 years old and has only one son, Yisheng, 18 years old. Through an introduction, Yisheng became an apprentice at the Hetai Lumber Company on Caishi Road in the French Concession. On October 24 of this year, he was sent by the company to Taikoo Wharf in Pudong to deliver goods. After finishing the work, he intended to return to the company on the Taikoo Yangxing's fast ferry. Somehow, Xu Yisheng fell into the Huangpu River and drowned. At the time, Luo Xiaogou, a sailor on the ferry, reported to the water police station that the deceased had jumped into the river to commit suicide. However, witnesses who were present at the time greatly disagreed, claiming that the deceased had actually been pushed into the river by Luo Xiaogou and tragically drowned, and they were willing to testify. The water police station detained Luo Xiaogou and the captain of the ferry, Cao Zhangbao, and sent them to the District Court. Prosecutor Wu Deying conducted a clear investigation and filed a public prosecution against Luo Xiaogou and others on charges of homicide.</p>
<p>The victim's father, Xu Baorong, hired lawyer Zhang Ji to file a private prosecution, stating that Baorong was old and unable to work, and his only hope for support was his son Yisheng. Moreover, he had only this one son. Now, due to the defendants' cruel actions, Baorong's family had lost their source of support. Yisheng had received a middle school education and was about to complete his apprenticeship. Soon, he would be earning a monthly salary of 40 yuan. Baorong's family's monthly expenses for food and lodging were 25 yuan, which amounted to 300 yuan per year. The defendants should be jointly and severally liable to pay 5,000 yuan in compensation. Furthermore, calculating Yisheng's salary of 40 yuan per month from the age of 18 until he reached the age of 60, the compensation should be 20,160 yuan. The total compensation for the two items above should be 25,160 yuan. It was also stated that water and fire were merciless, and even women and children knew that every year, hundreds of people drowned in the Huangpu River. Moreover, the accident occurred on September 17 of the lunar calendar, during the afternoon high tide. That day, the north wind was howling, and there were turbulent waves. Luo Xiaogou was relying on his service to British expatriates and claiming to have foreign support, so he dared to act so recklessly. His heart was more vicious than a snake or a scorpion. The defendant, Cao Zhangbao, was the captain and in charge of the entire ferry. He was steering the ship. He could not claim ignorance and should have stopped the ship to rescue the person. He was truly culpable. Yesterday morning at 10 AM, Judge Sun Ji publicly heard the case in the Fifth Court. Luo Xiaogou, who was in custody, was brought to the case. He stated that he was 27 years old and a sailor on the fast ferry. Only those with passes were allowed to take the ferry to Pudong. On October 24, at about 10 AM, the deceased was about to jump off the gangway onto the ferry. He accidentally fell into the river. When asked if he had asked for a pass (i.e., a free ticket), he replied that he had not. He stated that the ship was casting off at the time. When asked how far the ship was from the dock at that time, he replied about four feet. When it was said that people on the shore said that he had asked the deceased for a pass and that because the deceased did not have a pass, he had pushed him into the river, he replied that the person selling noodles on the shore had a grudge against him. When asked if Cao Zhangbao had seen someone fall into the water, he replied that the captain had to pay attention to the outside of the ship when it was starting, so he did not see it. Cao Zhangbao stated that he was 49 years old, from Shanghai, and lived in Zhongshi, Yangjiadu, Guidong. He was the captain of the fast ferry. When asked how Xu Yisheng had fallen into the river, he replied that he had not seen it. When asked why he did not stop the engine when someone fell into the river, he replied that he heard shouts from the shore and immediately ordered a sailor to use a pole to rescue the person, but it was too late. Xu Baorong stated that he was 58 years old and that Yisheng was his son. On the day in question, he was planning to take the fast ferry, but because he did not have a pass, he was pushed into the Huangpu River and drowned by Luo Xiaogou. He requested justice. When asked if he had seen it, he replied that he had not. He was in Ningbo when he received a telegram from the company, and he rushed to Shanghai. Witness Qu Genfu stated that he was 35 years old, from Jiangbei, and made a living selling noodles on the floating bridge at Pier No. 3 of Huatong in Pudong. When asked if he had seen someone fall into the river, he replied that he had. When asked how he had seen it, he replied that the gentleman (the deceased) had eaten a bowl of noodles at his stall and boarded the ship. When asked if he had completely disembarked with both feet, he replied that his left foot was on the edge of the ship, and his right foot had not yet stepped on it. When asked if he lost his balance and fell into the river, he replied that he did not. When he boarded the ship, the sailor asked for a pass. Because he did not have a pass, he wanted to return to shore, but the sailor pushed him into the river. When asked how he could see so clearly, he replied that when he boarded the ship, he took a lead bucket to the river to fetch water. When asked how far he was from the ship when he was fetching water, he replied about a丈. Witness Jiang Lingen stated that he was 25 years old, from Tongzhou, and lived with Qu Genfu at the same noodle stall. The rest of his testimony was the same as Qu Genfu's, and he vividly described how the deceased boarded the ship and how he fell into the water. Witness Du Jinfu stated that he was 34 years old, from Shanghai, and worked at the Jianghai Customs. On the day in question, he was taking the ferry from Pudong back to Puxi. He witnessed the deceased running from the shore and jumping onto the ferry, lost his balance, and fell into the river. When asked if the sailor Luo Gou had asked for a pass, he replied that he had not. When asked how far the ship was from the dock, he replied about four feet. Witness Yan Changgen stated that he was 24 years old, from Shanghai, and worked as a shoe dealer. On the day in question, he was also taking the ferry to sell shoes. He witnessed the deceased falling into the river on his own. Witness Xu Xiting stated that he was 40 years old, from Nanjing, and worked in the rope business. He was standing on the dock waiting for another ship and also saw the deceased falling into the Huangpu River on his own. At this point, prosecutor Wu presented his arguments, and then the defense began. The lawyer hired by the defendant rose to defend for a long time. Lawyer Zhang, the plaintiff's private prosecutor, requested to pursue the private prosecution. The judge considered the case closed and scheduled the sentencing for 10 AM on the 10th of this month. Cao Zhangbao, who had previously been released on 300 yuan bail, had his bail increased by 1,000 yuan. Luo Xiaogou was remanded in custody pending instructions.</p>

Tu Xiao hosted a banquet in Chu's honor at the International Hotel at 7 PM today, inviting Wang Zhengting, Gu Fuqing, Chen Zheqing, and Lin Kanghou, among others, to attend.

<p>Zhang Jingou Returned to China Yesterday After Inspecting Plant Diseases and Pests</p>
<p>Implementation of Inspection Will Begin Next Month</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry, recognizing that all countries attach great importance to the inspection of plant diseases and pests, specifically established a bureau to manage the inspection. However, China lacked such a system, so it drafted detailed measures, submitted them to the Executive Yuan for approval, and launched a pilot program. It also specifically sent Zhang Jingou, director of the plant disease and pest inspection team of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, to Japan, the South Seas Islands, and Taiwan to inspect and liaise with the relevant authorities in various countries to facilitate the inspection. Zhang returned to China yesterday. According to Zhang, during his trip abroad, he met with the inspection authorities in Japan, Taiwan, the South Seas Islands, and other places to discuss the inspection of plant diseases and pests and the facilitation of the inspection. The results were very satisfactory. The inspection systems in various countries are also very comprehensive and can serve as a reference for China. As for when China will implement plant disease and pest inspection, there are still various preparations to be made, so it will be difficult to implement it this month. It is expected to be implemented around January of next year.</p>
<p>The Carpenters' Dormitory Workers Petitioned the Guangdong Fellow Association</p>
<p>Requesting Re-examination of Chen Xiangzhi's Case</p>
<p>The workers in the Carpenters' Dormitory in this city previously had a dispute due to the Carpenters' Union's increase in the workers' fees by six cents, which led to a lawsuit over a murder case that has been ongoing for a long time. Because the worker Chen Xiang was sentenced to seven years in prison by the court, the workers in the dormitory felt that he was unjustly accused and were outraged. Three hundred workers gathered at the Guangdong Fellow Association in Shanghai yesterday afternoon to petition, requesting the association to forward their request to the Supreme Court to have Chen Xiangzhi's case sent back for re-examination to avoid an unjust sentence, and to mediate the dispute among the workers. At the time, Huan Quan, a member of the association, and Zheng Jianzhi, a social secretary, were appointed to receive them. They immediately telephoned Chen Fengyuan, the managing director, to inquire about the matter. As a result, it was decided to convene a board meeting during the day to discuss the matter and invite representatives from the various parties to attend the meeting for consultation.</p>

It plans to limit daily production to 125 boxes and use pine wood produced in Jiangsu and Zhejiang to promote domestically produced goods.</p>
<p>German Consul-General in Shanghai, Kriebel, to Visit Wang Jingwei in Nanjing</p>
<p>Will Get off the Train in Zhenjiang for Sightseeing</p>
<p>According to the German Consulate, German Consul-General in Shanghai, Kriebel, left Shanghai on the 11:00 PM express train to Nanjing the day before yesterday (3rd) with four translators. Kriebel's trip is said to be to meet with Wang Jingwei, who is also the Minister of Foreign Affairs, to discuss Sino-German relations and trade issues. However, Kriebel will not travel directly to Nanjing. Because he has long admired the scenic spots of Jinshan and Jiaoshan in Zhenjiang, he will get off the train in Zhenjiang and stay for a day or two before continuing to Nanjing. He is expected to return to Shanghai around Monday or Tuesday of next week.</p>
<p>The Local Association Elected Its President Yesterday</p>
<p>Du Yuesheng and Qian Xinzhi Elected as President and Vice President</p>
<p>The Shanghai Local Association held an emergency meeting of its members at 6 PM yesterday. Fifty-two members attended. Chairman Wang Xiaolai announced the agenda. The first item was to commemorate Chairman Shi. Everyone stood up and observed three minutes of silence to express their grief. Then, he reported on the association's work and proposed various motions. After that, the election of the president was held. Du Yuesheng received 44 votes and was elected. Then, the election of the vice president was held. Qian Xinzhi received 38 votes and was elected. The audience applauded thunderously. The chairman replaced the vacant position of director left by Li Bu with alternate director Feng Bingnan. Everyone agreed. Then, Pang Jingzhou reported on the rescue team's work in Guangchang, the situation in which Chiang Kai-shek sent a telegram requesting them to continue their work, and the situation in which the party, government, and military officials in Guangchang sent telegrams requesting them to stay. It was decided to continue the work immediately, and the attendees made immediate donations, totaling over 9,000 yuan. It was already 7 PM, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Excellent Collection Results of the Travel Industry Aviation Donation Last Month</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, after the Shanghai Travel Industry's results in collecting the National Salvation Donation for Travel and Aviation were compiled by the Office of the General Team Leader of the Aviation Association and published in the newspapers last month, it aroused the attention and competition of the travel industry. A small number of travel businesses that were hesitant have begun to automatically implement the collection, and those that had already started but were not serious have increased their efforts. Therefore, the results for this month have increased by 20-30% compared to the previous period. It can be seen that the National Salvation Donation for Travel and Aviation will be more enthusiastic in the future, and it will not be difficult to complete the travel industry airplane within the shortest period. It is understood that the donation has been extracted by Zhang Yuliang from the office. To ensure that all sectors understand the donation, it is stipulated that it will be published once a month. The results of the collection from the travel industry last month are recorded below:</p>

<p>Commercial News and Finance. The premium on gold rose again by two yuan and one jiao. The price of pure gold continued to rise, and the customs gold unit also went up. The market remained mediocre, starting strong but ending weak. The gold market has recently been mundane and unchanging. Overseas markets are bullish, and the opening is prosperous. However, the local market is weak, and the end result is still a decline. Yesterday's market was the same. Industry participants are demoralized, and daily trading is ordinary. The market situation remains stagnant. Early in the morning, the overseas silver market saw the British pound rise and the US dollar shrink. The forward silver price in Monte Carlo also fell by 2%. Exchange rates continued to plummet. The price of pure gold in London rose by four and a half pence. Reports of the Ministry of Finance's strict orders prohibiting the smuggling of silver were numerous. Although there was a lack of significant stimulus, people's minds were still affected. The over-the-counter pre-market trading opened, immediately rising to 95.6 yuan. However, partly due to psychological factors and concerns about the continued sharp decline in exchange rates, the outlook for the British exchange market was not optimistic. There was some supply at higher prices, causing a slight drop. However, as the Central Bank's listed price was announced, both the British and American currencies remained unchanged, and the customs gold unit rose by six li. The standard price of the premium on gold rose to 1009.3 yuan, disappointing sellers. The opening in the morning was still firm. After the opening, supply and demand in the market were balanced, and banks also engaged in mutual transactions. The opening immediately showed a struggling situation. However, it eventually rose due to large players jointly advancing. Banks, indeed due to exchange rate reasons, jointly supplied shillings. Sellers were active at higher prices, gradually moving downstream. In addition, when the HSBC Bank's listed price was announced, both the British and American currencies rose by 1.25, causing a temporary decline. However, it was easy to pull it up after the decline. However, there was a strong demand from sellers of British currency, and the source of supply in the market was endless. The announcement of the silver equalization tax remained unchanged, still levying 6.75%. The calculation of the British currency at one shilling and five pence six eight seven five had little impact. Thereafter, the supply side was more enthusiastic, gradually moving downstream. Retail investors and floating longs also began to waver, resulting in another slight drop. However, large players aggressively advanced at lower prices. The final transaction was idle, and it was pulled up again at noon. The after-market opening was quite stable. However, as banks continued to push out, industry participants were more inclined to sell. After rising, it fell again. Large players came in at lower prices. Although there was struggle, the exchange market was hardening. In addition, the first report of Indian silver at two annas was unavoidable. However, people's minds were still calm, and it could still be pulled up after the decline. However, there were few transactions, making it difficult to cause special changes. Finally, Indian silver returned to a small one anna. The closing seemed slightly stable. The momentum of the day was still strong at the beginning but weak at the end. Overseas telegrams mentioned slight inflation and other information, but this had no significant impact. The market situation of the day is recorded below. The opening in the morning was 995.5 yuan, an increase of 3.2 jiao from the previous closing. Da Fa, Yongfu Xing, Yongfu Chang, Da Chang Xiang, Yuan Mao, Yong Da, and De Cheng jointly advanced. Despite the supply, it gradually rose to 7.4 jiao. However, there was a lot of struggle in the middle. The market was filled with February shillings at 1.25. In addition, it was anticipated that the HSBC Bank's listed prices for the British and American currencies would each rise by 1.25. Sellers took advantage of the high prices. Fuyu, Yongde, and Yongfeng Lai sold, gradually decreasing to 4.7 jiao. Yuan Chang and Yongheng Chang not only bought at lower prices but also gradually rose to 6.3 jiao. However, due to Mitsui and Wah Bi selling January shillings at 1.875, it still fell. Soon, Shanghai recovered March shillings at four pence. Qian Chang Xiang, Yuan Yi, Yongfeng Shun Mao, and Lu Xu successively supplied. The silver equalization tax remained unchanged, still levying 6.75%. The calculation of the British currency at one shilling and five pence six eight seven five, although people's minds were calm, the supply exceeded demand, and it finally fell to 4.5 yuan. Although Hengyu and others advanced to 5.5 yuan, Shun Mao still had a desire to sell, making it difficult to rise further. Shanghai released January shillings at 1.875. The Central Bank also divested itself of April US dollars at 1.25. Thereafter, Dafa Yong slightly sold. Retail investors and floating longs were uneasy and retreated to 4.3 yuan. However, due to Hengyu's efforts to purchase, it was able to support it. Later, Hengyu, Hengchang, Yongchang, Daheng Xingyuan, Tongchun, and others slightly bought, rebounding to 5.9 jiao. After hovering, the noon closing was 995.8 jiao. The market was stable after the closing. The after-market opened at 996.5 yuan. Qingyu and Hengyu advanced, rising to 7 yuan. Da Chang Xiang, Fuxing, Yongfu Chang, Qian Chang Xiang, and Fuyu jointly supplied. Wah Bi sold February shillings at 0.0625 and US dollars at 0.25, falling to 4.6 yuan. Hengyu and Tianfeng and others bought, rising to 5.2 jiao. However, due to Fuchang and Hengxing coming to sell, it fell again to 4 yuan. Yuan Yi limited the market to advance, rising to 4.7 jiao. However, Mitsui released January shillings at 0.25 and US dollars at 0.5625. Wah Bi sold February shillings at 1.25. People's minds were finally tired. Fuxing and Yongfu Chang and Hengyu sold. Bombay rose by 2.2.1 annas. Although Tongfeng Heng advanced, it still fell to 2.8 jiao. Fuchang and Hengyu suddenly bought at low prices, rising again to 4.6 jiao. Zhaofeng Changsheng Da You so many let go of them. Dalian Xiang and Fuxing Yong also advanced and retreated uncertainly, gradually retreating to 3.4 jiao, and then hovering around 4 yuan. Finally, Bombay returned to a small 1.1.1 anna. Huixiang and Hengyu and others advanced, rising to 4.5 yuan. Shengsheng slightly sold. The closing price was 994.4 yuan, flat after the closing. The highest price of the day was 997.4 yuan, and the lowest price was 992.8 yuan, a difference of 4.6 yuan. As a result, it rose by 2.1 jiao from the previous closing. The closing price was listed at the Central Bank's standard premium price of 1009.3 yuan. According to the closing price, it was about 15 yuan weak, less than 1 yuan more than the previous closing. The book entry price for this month was 987 yuan, and for January it was 996 yuan. The morning replenishment was 987 yuan, and the afternoon replenishment was 985 yuan. The price of red gold was 993.5 yuan. The spot market continued to be slightly active. The Tianjin gang sold 700 taels to Yingfeng Heng at a premium of 3.6 jiao. The swap discount was also cheap. The buyer, Dadecheng, offered 14 points, Yingfeng Heng offered 28 points, and Yifeng Yong offered only 7.5 yuan. The December points will soon be cleared. In addition, today's swap increased again. If the public orders for the day are excluded, only 35 points remain. In total, the only short side was Dafeng Heng, while the long sides were Yifeng Yong, Ding Kang, and Daxing Yong. Transaction activity in the market continued to be idle, and trading volume was light. In total, Tongfeng Heng, Tianfeng, Dafa Yong, Dadecheng, Dachangxiang, Hengyu Yuqing, Yongqing Fa, Yong Tongfu, Wanchang, Yonghengchang, Yonghongxing, and Hengxing Yuanchang, Dayuan Mao Yong, Yongli, and others were on the buying side. Futai Heng, Yuan Yi, Fuyu, Qian Chang Xiang, Zhaofeng Chang, Yuli, Lifeng, Yifeng Yong, Shun Mao, Yongfeng Yuan, Kangxiang Juchang, Yingxiang Dafeng, Heng Da Kang Yongde Xiang, Feng Yuan Chang, Yongfu Xing, Yongfu Chang, Wan Xing Shun Li, Shengda, and others were on the selling side. Tongchun Fuxing Yongyuan Chang Yong advanced first and then exited. Yicheng Yuan Yi exited first and then entered. The Dalian gang and Wan Xing jointly traded more than 800 points, netting more than 200 points. Shun Li jointly traded about 400 points, netting about 100 points. Although the Guang gang Shengsheng Heng had few transactions, there were more sellers. The total number of transactions for the day was 21,854 points in the morning and 14,462 points in the afternoon. The total number of January futures points was 27,699 points. There were a total of 65 long parties and 56 short parties. All public orders were settled on the same day. Yesterday, 42 points were settled by the short side. Those who settled were Yingfeng Heng 28 points and Dadecheng 14 points. Those who received were Yifeng Yong 21 points, Qingfa Yong Yuan Yi and Futai Heng 7 points each. The closing price was 987 yuan. The foreign exchange market was loose for the British currency and tight for the US currency. ▲Banks Dumped: The process was tight at first and then tough. The foreign exchange market yesterday showed that the telegram from London was great, with both near and far term rising by 0.0625. The US bank shrank by 0.125, the forward silver price fell by 2%, the London pure gold rose by four and a half pence, the British pound against the US dollar shrank by 1.75 cents, the US dollar against the British pound fell by 1.625 cents, the British pound against the French franc fell by 19 pounds, and the US dollar against the French franc fell by 375.

Compared to the previous closing, the British currency was tighter by 0.0625 and the US currency was tighter by 1.875. People's minds were better. However, the spot market price was extremely chaotic. After the opening, banks traded with each other. The Central Bank's listed price was announced, with both the British and American currencies remaining unchanged, and the customs gold unit rising by six li and settling. The current US dollar was about 0.125 tighter than the futures. When the HSBC Bank's listed price was announced, both the British and American currencies rose by 1.25, and people's minds were slightly tired. In addition, because of the sharp decline in exchange rates, banks continued to aggressively dump shillings. The Chinese business community's mindset was still stable. Although the process was smooth afterward, it was slightly dazed. The spot exchange rate had hardened. The after-market opening was slightly tight. However, banks took advantage of the high prices to aggressively supply, and the market trend was not prosperous. Indian silver rose by two annas for the first time. The Chinese business community's appetite for buying had already weakened and continued to harden. Although domestic goods were buying US dollars, the British pound still had value. Finally, Indian silver swallowed a small one anna, and there was a lack of change. The closing selling price was one shilling and four pence for the British currency and thirty-four yuan for the US currency. Compared to the previous closing, the British currency was loose and the US currency was tight by 0.0625. This was due to the exchange rate relationship. Although the Dalian gang had a desire to sell, the Chinese business community bought US$300,000 and 100,000 pounds of shillings. The transaction price is recorded below. The British currency morning opening near-term selling price was one shilling and four pence three seven five. Market sentiment was filled with February shillings at 0.125.

In recent days, the financial community has been working hard to remedy the situation. As of yesterday and the day before yesterday, it has slightly recovered. Yesterday, the foreign call loan rate fell by another three cents, only 0.25 yuan, slightly less than the previous day's market price. There is hope that foreign funds will return. The money supply has become very loose, only two or three cents, and the money position is very abundant. The trading of call loan notes was over 3.1 million in the morning market, over 200,000 in new transactions, over 400,000 in the afternoon market, over 300,000 in the small general meeting, over 800,000 in foreign mortgage loans taken back, and over 900,000 in new loans made.

Although bank collections and payments were appropriately complex yesterday, the end of the year is not far off. Even if there are large-scale uses, they dare not develop them as much as possible. It is estimated that foreign banks collected and paid over 3.1 million in bills, paid over 5 million in various goods, exchange mortgages, and miscellaneous collections and payments, over 900,000 in foreign exchange settlement payments, and over 800,000 in special exchange payments, and over 500,000 in warehouse entries.

Also, the total number of exchanges in the city's clearing house on the 4th was 8,919,222.57 silver yuan, including 4,020,706.91 silver yuan and 4,898,515.66 silver yuan in exchange transfers. The market price for double-horn coins has increased. ▲Copper coins are gradually shrinking. The Jiangnan small foreign coins in yesterday's market, both in the morning and afternoon, had no major inflows and outflows, so they were the same as the previous day, calculated at 840 yuan. The transaction volume was 5,000 jiao in the morning market and 2,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small foreign coins only started to rise by three cents, calculated at 750 yuan and 0.01 jiao in the morning market. The afternoon market suddenly increased by 2.4 yuan, to 752.5 yuan. As a result, it improved by 2.7 yuan compared to the previous day's afternoon market. The transaction volume was 115,000 jiao in the morning market and 45,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins shrank again by 2,000 wen, to 302,000 wen. The transaction volume was 22,952 strings, calculated at a price of 7,600 foreign yuan. Interest negotiation in the past month. An investigation of the daily foreign exchange rates in the past month (November) showed that the first half of the month was not very expensive, but the second half of the month suddenly exceeded the significant range, as high as four corners, and the total statistics for the entire month were over 5.6 yuan. Since the base of the interest rate was large, the negotiation price also increased. The Standing Committee of the Money Industry Association decided the other day that the interest rate was 5.595 yuan, which was a world of difference compared to the October market price, which was 2 yuan. In this case, the interest market price has exceeded the fixed settlement price of 4.5 yuan, so this time the interest will inevitably increase, with the highest interest generally being around 12 yuan. Securities Debt market trends are softening. Unfounded rumors are lightly shrouded. Down two to four jiao. Yesterday's trend on the Chinese Securities Exchange was hovering and weak. After many days of gains, there was a small pause. It was a matter of expectations that the foreign exchange rate fell to two and a half jiao and the head and tail did not match. It seemed that the money market had loosened. However, the market price was weak, which was beyond some people's expectations. In fact, there were too many long positions. There are two common concepts in long positions' psychology: one is that the Fifth National Congress will definitely be held as scheduled, and the market price will definitely rise after the meeting; the other is that the market price is still far from the previous peak, and the salt tax and unified tax have increased the number of repayments starting in February. All kinds of situations are beneficial to long positions, so those who take long positions are very active, and they are all going long in the future. Therefore, the forward market prices of each debt market are almost equal to this month. In the past, when there were occasional phenomena like this, it would cause arbitrage transactions and pull the market to level. This phenomenon has been going on for many days, but arbitrage is not possible. It can be seen that the money market has not yet loosened. However, the recent need for cash has been rare, so the foreign exchange rate has returned to low levels. The future of the market price is likely to be hovering and weak for the time being. Yesterday's experience was that although the foreign exchange rate continued to fall, the opening market price fell immediately. The disarmament was more than half a yuan lower. Long positions were too eager, and this was even more convincing. After entering the 23rd pass, it recovered slightly. The previous series in the second round recovered two or three jiao, and the end returned to loosen one or two jiao. The trends in the opening and closing rounds were exactly the opposite. The afternoon two rounds were weak and sluggish. The opening was a small one or two jiao, and the closing was about one jiao lower. There were slight unfounded rumors in the market. The market price results were that it fell by about two to four jiao. In terms of transactions, they were still out in bulk and in retail, out near and in far. The total number of transactions was 9.91 million yuan.

Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that the New York Stock Market yesterday (3rd) was extremely sluggish, trending downstream. Part of the reason was that long positions were slightly closed to take profits. The reason why the public lacked interest was that the end of the year was approaching and there was no special reason. However, the potential was still good, and the debt market was stable. US government bonds were quite strong, due to the good response to the Ministry of Finance's financial management in December. Small exchange stocks had mixed ups and downs. Chicago wheat fell due to the lack of a significant reduction in the visible supply of spot goods, disappointing people. Long positions closed to take profits and fell. The total number of transactions for the day was 750,000 shares.

The Yarn Market is Hovering with a Soft Trend. The yarn market continued to be weak, and the situation was bleak. Overseas cotton continued to fall, and spot yarn sales turned quiet again, causing people's minds to be depressed. However, the yarn received by a certain company was firmly held and not released. Japanese short positions also had no intention of covering. The market became a hovering situation, and the buying interest in standard yarn slightly weakened. The opening of the standard yarn pre-market was due to the continued fall in US cotton, which caused people's minds to be depressed. There was a lack of buyers in the market, and the market atmosphere softened. Each month fell by two, three, four, six, and seven jiao. In the afternoon, it was heard that spot yarn sales were sluggish. The total number of transactions for the day by each gang was only over 700 packages. The market situation was even more lifeless. However, this month was more expensive, rising by five jiao. The remaining months all fell by one, two, three, and four jiao. The total number of transactions for the day was 25,400 packages. It was found that Hengyi sold 450 packages, Mingde 550 packages, Zhenda 300 packages, Tongxing 300 packages, Yuan Yi 300 packages, Changfeng 1,500 packages, Run Kang 650 packages, Xincheng 1,750 packages, Gengfeng 850 packages, Changyu 400 packages, Yongda 750 packages, and Renfeng 300 packages.

Guangdong 235 Luzhou 10 Changsha 10 Inland 310 North Gang 20 Nanjing 1 Ningbo 15 Fellow Traders 10 Shantou 50 Yunnan 60 Shaanxi Cotton Congestion, Marked Cotton Falls Daily The cotton market is getting weaker, because American cotton is still falling. The market's current cotton mill needs are very sluggish, and the mills' intentions are flat. However, buyers are absorbing a lot. Although foreign cotton is weak, the calculated price is still high, making it difficult to come to Shanghai. Another message is that the northwest road is crowded with cotton. Due to transportation difficulties, it is temporarily impossible to arrive in Shanghai. In the future, there is hope that they will arrive in Shanghai one after another. Zheng Biao gradually lowered three or four jiao. The opening of the standard flower pre-market, although Indian flowers rose, American cotton still fell and the exchange rate lengthened, making it difficult for people to feel good. More longs closed, and the platform became more and more lax. The near term fell by 2.5 jiao, and the far term fell by 1.5 jiao. The market situation was even more virtual in the afternoon opening of the marked flowers. According to a company's news, the new cotton production on the Shaanxi Road is quite good. Due to the lack of vehicles, transportation is difficult. In general, it has not yet been shipped out. It is said that there will be a large number of cotton coming to Shanghai in the future, so the market is still sluggish. The near term fell by 1.5 jiao, and the far term fell by 0.05 to 0.1 jiao. The total number of transactions for the day was 110,790 dan. It was found that Yuanyi sold 3,000 dan, Gengfeng 4,900 dan, Tongji 2,000 dan, Jifeng 2,200 dan, Hengyi 1,000 dan, Zhenda 1,200 dan, Huikang 2,500 dan, Yuande 1,300 dan, Changfeng 2,500 dan, Xincheng 4,400 dan, Deji 2,100 dan, Yikang 2,200 dan, Changhe 4,000 dan, and Shenji 1,600 dan.

The spot price fell by 10 pounds, and the futures fell by 9 to 18 pounds. The spot price of English cotton was unchanged, and the futures rose by two or three points. Indian cotton was firm due to retail and Japanese purchases and short covering. Pingle rose by one rupee, Aomula rose by 2.25 rupees, and Bailuoxi rose by 1.5 rupees.

<p>My Family Won't Let Me Continue My Education</p>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I have a question about lifelong learning that I would like you to give me a satisfactory answer to.</p>
<p>I am a junior high school student about to graduate, and based on my family's financial situation, I still have the possibility of entering high school. However, judging from my father's recent intentions, he is unwilling to let me continue studying. He hopes that after I graduate, he can find something for me to do, which will not only reduce a large sum of money from the family, but may also be able to subsidize the household a bit. But I myself feel that my knowledge is very shallow and not enough to cope with everything in society, and in this era of extremely high unemployment, with my junior high school qualifications, what good job can I find? Therefore, for my future happiness, I have decided to request to continue my education in order to seek higher learning. So in the past two days, I have talked to my family several times, asking them to satisfy my desire for education. But they have very firmly and stubbornly refused my request. As a result, there is a conflict of opinion between me and my family. I originally wanted to break with them, but then I thought that after the break, the source of economic support would be cut off. Then, not only would I not be able to study, but I would not even be able to maintain my personal life. But if I just give in to my family and stop studying after graduation, I feel that the future is too hopeless and life is too meaningless. So now I think that if I can't achieve my goal, I might as well just die, so as not to suffer in the future. Sir, you are a guiding needle in my lost way. In my situation, what should I do? I respectfully hope for your answer. With best wishes for your well-being.</p>
<p>Editor's Note:</p>
<p>The reason why most people cannot continue their education is due to financial difficulties. It seems too rare and too stubborn that Ji Jun's family has the financial ability to provide their children with continued education, but they ignore Ji Jun's future happiness and resolutely ask him to stop studying and find a job. Now, based on the meaning of the letter, the editor has assumed several steps for your reference. ㈠ First, ask relatives and friends to find a way to gently discuss with your family, hoping that they can change their prejudices and allow your request. ㈡ If they definitely do not agree, then you can only plead with your family again, or argue with them, and insist on your determination to continue your education. When they are too annoyed, they may allow you to do so. ㈢ Suicide is the behavior of the weak. I hope you don't think of death just because you can't go to school, but when there is no room for redemption, you might as well use [death] to threaten your family. We think that elders always love their children, and they will never let you die. So if you demand it with your life, then you can finally achieve your goal. If you have other opportunities for borrowing or work-study, that would be even better, and you won't have to ask your family. Finally, the editor believes that all kinds of knowledge are not limited to what can be obtained in schools. A person has the opportunity to study anytime and anywhere. Serving is also studying, and we believe that only practical life experience is real knowledge. However, these words are for those who are unable to enter school to study. If they have the ability, of course it is better to go to school to study.</p>

<p>Opening [Sweeping Qin]</p>
<p>Don't laugh at my crazy, foolish appearance. The Earth Store Bodhisattva intentionally descends to the mortal world. He sits in meditation in the Lingyin Temple. He writes a poem on the wall to sweep away Qin. The current Prime Minister comes to offer incense. He holds three sticks of green incense in his hand. He lowers his head and silently communicates with the gods. He only hopes for favorable weather and good harvests. He only seeks for the husband and wife to have longevity. He blesses the virtuous father and son of the Yue family to ascend to the immortal realm as soon as possible. He suddenly sees the poem and the treacherous hero trembles in fear. This poem is written with his wife. The incident is revealed and a fire starts. He immediately shouts angrily at the crazy monk. He doesn't know that he is full of Zen and can change in many ways. He can summon wind and rain. He holds a fire tube to communicate with foreign countries. He also takes a palm broom to sweep away treacherous officials. The storm is only caused by monopolizing power. He dies unjustly in the Cold Spring Pavilion. Returning home, the husband and wife discuss together to shave their heads and become monks and nuns, giving up fame and fortune. They listen to the long-tongued woman. They suffer the hellish punishment. Now his whole body is cast in iron at Yue Wang's tomb.</p>

<p>The sound of Sheng songs rises halfway up the jade building. It avoids the pleasures of the Manli Palace. It happens to be the night of Qixi. The romantic emperor is infatuated. At his leisure, he drives to the Eternal Life Palace. He privately invites the true concubine to worship the Weaver Girl. A bay of new moon is as bright as water. Ten thousand pieces of autumn cloud are as thin as gauze. He secretly thinks about the affairs of the double stars in the sky. There is a road on the magpie bridge to cross the Milky Way. He sighs that human life is easy to change and red face is replaced. A hundred years are like a shuttle. It is better to book a three-life agreement in advance, and wish that the zither and lute will not be delayed in the future. In the sky, I wish to use double flying wings. On the ground, I should be connected branches. After wishing, he turns around the palace building. The golden hairpin and jewellery receive grace. The water curtain is rolled up near the autumn river.</p>

<p>Their forms disappear in the dust beyond Xianyang Bridge.</p>
<p>Pulling at clothes, stamping feet, they cry and block the road,</p>
<p>Their wails reach the high heavens.</p>
<p>A passerby asks a conscript,</p>
<p>The conscript says only that the conscription is frequent.</p>
<p>Some from fifteen north to defend the river,</p>
<p>Then to forty west to garrison the fields.</p>
<p>When they left, the village head wrapped their heads,</p>
<p>Returning with white hair, they still defend the border.</p>
<p>The blood flows at the border to form a sea,</p>
<p>The Emperor Wu's intention to expand the border is not yet finished.</p>
<p>Have you not heard that of the Han family's two hundred prefectures east of the mountains,</p>
<p>Thousands of villages grow thorns and reeds?</p>
<p>Even if there are strong women holding plows,</p>
<p>The wheat grows east and west in the fields.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Qin soldiers endure bitter battles,</p>
<p>Driven no differently than dogs and chickens.</p>
<p>Although the elders have hatred,</p>
<p>How dare the conscripts express their hatred?</p>
<p>Moreover, this year there are many</p>
<p>Unfinished levies in Guanzhong.</p>
<p>The county officials urgently demand rent,</p>
<p>From where can the rent and taxes come?</p>
<p>Believe me, it is evil to give birth to a son,</p>
<p>It is better to give birth to a daughter.</p>
<p>A daughter can still be married to a neighbor,</p>
<p>A son is buried and buried in the wilderness.</p>
<p>Have you not seen the shores of Qinghai?</p>
<p>Since ancient times, the white bones have been uncollected.</p>
<p>New ghosts worry the old ghosts,</p>
<p>When the sky is overcast and the rain is wet, their voices cry out.</p>

<p>Hollywood in the Midst of Recession</p>
<p>Su Hua</p>
<p>European Silver Star and Famous Director Hired by Fox</p>
<p>Curval Boedt and Eric Charell Worth Noting</p>
<p>The dense fog of recession is undeniably enveloping the globe. The extremely luxurious Hollywood also feels extreme unease. Smaller production companies with less capital have no choice but to stop working. And those famous film companies with strong capital and solid foundations, such as MGM, Paramount, RKO, and Fox, although they will not experience any [economic panic]; however, now they have to carefully calculate the expenditure for each film.</p>
<p>In this situation of economic tightening, Fox Company spared no expense to hire a European red star, Curval Boedt, and a famous director, Eric Charell, to Hollywood to join their ranks. Isn't this a very noteworthy thing?</p>
<p>Before we know why Fox Company spared no expense to hire these two artists, I should give the readers a brief introduction to them.</p>
<p>For Curval Boedt, I'm afraid most of us still feel very unfamiliar. This is because the films he starred in in Europe rarely come to Shanghai. He is a red-hot person on the stage in Europe, and also a bright and shining star on the screen. Now Fox Company has invited him to Hollywood, and the first film they gave him to star in is the musical epic [The Taming of the Shrew] made by Fox Company at a cost of millions of dollars (it is said that this film will be released in Shanghai).</p>
<p>Indeed, Curval Boedt has many things worth admiring. He has received a very good education. He is already married (the female lead in [Rembrandt] showing in Shanghai, Gertrude Michael). He has the gentleness of a poet and the healthy physique of a boxer. He is kind and courteous in dealing with people, and has never shown any unhappiness. In his half-open and half-closed eyes, he fully expresses the enthusiasm in his heart. Interestingly, the contours of his face are very similar to [famous comedian] Charlie Chaplin, and his actions also have similarities with Charlie Chaplin.</p>
<p>He was born with a very determined temperament. He must do well what he intends to do, without any doubt. He intended to practice English specially for two months before filming [The Taming of the Shrew] recently. Now his pronunciation is so accurate that it is beyond his own expectations. His only hobby is that he likes to smoke cigarettes very much. Outdoor sports are also his favorite. Skating can be said to be his forte. I'm afraid there are not many people in Hollywood who can compare with him in skating skills.</p>
<p>Famous director Eric Charell, I'm afraid everyone knows him. The world-praised [Congress Dances] is his production. Using music as the background and using music to harmonize the atmosphere in the play are his special skills and the success of his works. This time he came to Hollywood and directed Fox's million-dollar epic [The Taming of the Shrew]. We believe that Fox Company's sacrifice of a huge amount of money will definitely achieve considerable results.</p>
<p>The question is turned over again, now we must understand that film is a noble and conscious entertainment. It can provide people with knowledge, experience, comfort people's hearts, and make people forget temporary troubles. Therefore, even in the midst of the recession, noble and beneficial entertainment is still needed; in other words, people who are committed to the mission of the eighth art should provide people with some happiness as much as possible when the world is plunged into gloom, so that people's lives will not continue to be monotonous. Perhaps Fox Company's willingness to hire these two artists at no expense this time is based on this purpose.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<p>Review of [Female Prisoner] Jin Cheng Ling He</p>
<p>In any case, this film is one that we should earnestly discuss with the author, because from content to form, [Female Prisoner] is not a successful work.</p>
<p>First of all, we must say that the author's narrow concept of revenge inevitably plunges this film into the old quagmire. Naturally, the main reason for its failure is that the play cannot grasp the reality in the work, but is just fantasy and fiction. So when we watch this film, we only feel that we are listening to a story that is not related to our daily life, and of course it cannot arouse our true emotions.</p>
<p>Although we dare not say that [Female Prisoner] is a reflection of [petty bourgeois thought], the author's outdated ideas are undeniable. It is very clear that he used the means of flattering power to construct the so-called [revolution] story. But this explanation of [revolution] is ridiculous in any case. For example, is the daughter of the so-called [revolutionary] a revolutionary? No, she doesn't understand anything about national affairs at all, she only knows that the hatred of killing her father must be avenged, but the author says at the end that she is eliminating harm for the country. This is a far-fetched association for no reason in any case. As for the concept of personal revenge, it is even more unnecessary to explain.</p>
<p>On the playwright's side, perhaps he thinks that the enemy is the husband's father, and that killing the father-in-law for revenge is quite dramatic, but in our opinion, it is better to say that it is an impossible coincidence than a dramatic grasp. In fact, the playwright does not want her to marry the son of a fried dough stick seller, but wants her to combine with a young master, which shows his outdated ideas. Moreover, it is not a realistic stereotype that a young master would marry a wandering girl. As for the son not knowing his father's real name, and the real name being tattooed on his hand, but the son never discovered it, it is also unbelievable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since the playwright thinks that the revenge scene is the highlight, we will not discuss whether it is correctly expressed for the time being. The playwright undoubtedly regards it as the climax of the whole play, but the result is that the director uses an extremely slow tone, and unnecessarily prolongs the time, resulting in not only a lack of tension, but also a feeling of unbearable dullness. It is conceivable that it is not a film technique.</p>
<p>Let's look at how the director portrays the characters in the play. This can be explained by taking the heroine as a representative. If she is to take on the heavy responsibility of revenge, then she should have the posture of a hero, but what is shown on the screen is that she not only does not have the spirit of a hero, but is a very mediocre woman. In addition, we don't need to go into detail about the unsuccessful acting skills.</p>
<p>Marlene Dietrich Buys Keys Donglin</p>
<p>[Could it be that she has found a lover?]</p>
<p>Recently, because Marlene Dietrich often goes to hardware stores to buy keys, people in Hollywood are looking at her with curious eyes.</p>
<p>Do you know why this is? It turns out that in Hollywood, if a woman gives a key to a man, it means [I can let you have everything [free]]. For this reason, when people see Marlene buying keys there, they all think that she must have found a lover.</p>
<p>But the strange thing is that Dietrich is always buying keys, but she has never seen the shadow of the [so-called lover]. So people have to wonder again.</p>
<p>A friend finally couldn't bear it anymore. One day, when he saw Dietrich, he immediately asked: [Why are you always buying keys?]</p>
<p>Marlene smiled and replied after hearing her friend's words: [Do you know that my daughter Maria is very naughty? When I'm not at home, she always takes the keys to who knows where, so I always have to get new keys!]</p>
<p>This mystery is finally broken!</p>
<p>The Capital Air Defense Exercise Was Filmed by Yihua</p>
<p>Yi</p>
<p>When the capital held a major air defense exercise on the 25th of last month, Yihua Company sent a large number of people to shoot news films in order to arouse the attention of the people to air defense. The directors included Zheng Yingshi, director of [Flying Flower Village], Shi Dongshan, director of [The Beginning of Man], Yuan Congmei, director of [The Sacrificer], and photographers Zhou Ke, Wang Yang, and photography assistants Tong Benkui and Han Zhongliang. Shi Dongshan and Zhou Ke specialized in shooting the fighting and competition of airplanes, Zheng Yingshi and Tong Benkui specialized in shooting the activities of anti-aircraft artillery teams, security teams, and fire brigades, and Yuan Congmei and Wang Yang specialized in shooting the work of maintaining law and order on the streets and obstacles. They ran around tirelessly. Sometimes they took airplanes together to shoot aerial combat scenes, sometimes they followed behind the fire brigade to shoot disaster relief situations, and sometimes they went back and forth between the anti-aircraft artillery team and the searchlight team to shoot real anti-aircraft artillery scenes. Therefore, when they came back, none of them were not as tired as cotton wool, but their harvest was really a lot.</p>
<p>Soviet Russia's Great Construction [Storm] Opens Today</p>
<p>[Storm] is a super-special production of the Soviet Russian Suki Film Company in 1934, starring the famous Soviet Russian female star Tarasava. The content tells the story of an orphan girl who, when she gets married, is blinded by her husband's family because she has no huge dowry. After various twists and turns, she finally throws herself into the river and dies. The plot is sad and gorgeous, and it is worthy of singing and weeping. Its exposure to the contradictions of life and the selfishness of human beings can be said to be complete. According to the original author of this film, it is the world-famous playwright Ostrovsky. Ostrovsky is good at depicting the dark side of social life in the old Russian era. This play is his masterpiece in his life. It has been staged many times in Europe before, and recently it was made into a film by Soviet Russia. On the day of its release in Soviet Russia, thousands of people flocked to it, which was very grand for a while, and its value can be imagined. Now the film has been decided to be released in Shanghai's Paris Grand Theater starting from the 5th of this month.</p>

<p>Film Novel</p>
<p>The Mother-Daughter Relationship (Lady by Cholce) (3) Zhong Jia</p>
<p>Panxi was startled when she heard the judge scolding her. She thought that the judge was always very kind, but why was he so strict this time? She only heard the judge say to the police officer who arrested her: [Take her down. I will consider it again for the time being. Second case!] When he shouted the second case, his voice was louder. Alaban looked at Panxi staggering and following the policeman out, and couldn't help feeling depressed. And the second case was hers. She originally listened to her manager Kendall and asked the police to bring her up in order to stir up public opinion as publicity. But now she was a little scared. She felt that the court was not a good place to play, and this time she was probably fooled by Kendall. After a while, when it was her turn to appear in court, she became even more afraid, because what she expected was not bad. Her pleas seemed to be blown away by the wind, and she couldn't hear them. Although according to her ideal, the statue in the art academy only covered her lower body with a fig leaf, and she was still covering herself with such a large ostrich feather fan. Unexpectedly, the judge gave her a long lecture. She still argued strongly: [My feather fan dance is not bad at all. I can dance it for you now. But you have to imagine all the lights and music……] As she spoke, she gently stretched out her wrist and untied her loose leather coat. The judge was startled when he saw it, even though he only saw a snow-white and tender shoulder. He immediately took the hammer, knocked on the public case and shouted: [No dancing! The court is a night court, not a nightclub! I now sentence you to one year of imprisonment on Black Well Island and a fine of one hundred yuan!] After he finished speaking, he saw infinite panic and grief suddenly appear on the woman's face. They thought that his heart was too hard. Or perhaps Panxi's case made him so angry. Because his kindness did not help Panxi, if Alaban was arrested for the first time and she was not severely punished, she would become Panxi the second in the future. Then his strictness was right, but when he looked at Alaban's face again, he felt unbearable again, because her face was full of an unimaginable sorrow, her lips were trembling, her eyes contained two bags of tears, and the child-like face could not be seen in the midnight court. In this way, he felt that perhaps he was too strict. So he involuntarily continued: [However, because you are in front of me for the first time, I can announce a suspended sentence. Do not commit the crime again next time. If you dance naked again, whether you have a feather fan or not, in short, it is to destroy the peace and morality of this city, and I will immediately execute the previous sentence. Second case!] In this way, he lightly dismissed Alaban. After he finished hearing several other cases and retired to the rest room, he was already exhausted. He saw Panxi was still waiting there, and there was still an empty wine bottle in the wastepaper basket, which was the case every time Panxi came here. At first, he was very unhappy, but soon he felt that he should understand her. He also felt sorry for her. At this time, he had to use strong wine to warm her heart and maintain her spirit. So he ordered the court clerk: [Quickly call Johnny Mills!] Panxi couldn't help but feel half a head shorter when she heard this. She originally hoped that Johnny would not know about this recent case. Johnny was instructed by his father a few years ago to look for her and take care of her. That was the last thing his father told him before he died. Johnny actually found her after listening to his father's words, but he had no way to take care of her. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e175">Record of the Trial of Notorious Kidnapper Zheng Tangsheng's Conspiracy to Escape Prison <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Passing Letters and Obtaining Pistols and Nitric Acid Through a Guard</p>
<p>Yesterday, the court interrogated the defendants separately, each attempting to shift the blame.</p>
<p>Zheng Tangsheng, a local notorious kidnapper involved in kidnapping for ransom, tearing up victims, and burying bodies in Shanghai and Tianjin, was apprehended by the French police in Tianjin around July of last year, brought to Shanghai, and prosecuted by the Second Special District Court. During the trial, the criminal once attempted suicide in the police station jail but was discovered, taken down, and sent to the hospital for treatment. He was then sentenced to death according to the Bandit Suppression Regulations. Zheng refused to accept the original verdict and appealed to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, which approved a retrial. However, Zheng, while detained in the heavy criminal section of the Second Special District Court's jail, recently plotted another escape. He wrote a letter, entrusting Liu Ruiting, a guard from Yangzhou, to deliver it to Li Jingen, a friend from Shanghai residing at No. 1, Lane 16, Renji Road, Pudong, asking him to obtain nitric acid and a pistol and arrange a time for the escape. However, the net of justice is inescapable. The plan was discovered by Jin Jiulin, the Chief Inspector of the French Concession's Special Agency, along with detectives Zhang Ziying and Qian Yumin. On the 16th of last month, Li Quangen was arrested at No. 25 Ailige Road and sent to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Simultaneously, Zheng and the guard Liu Ruiting were transferred from the jail to the procuratorate for investigation and prosecution. On the 24th of last month, Judge Qiu Huan-ying, together with Chief Prosecutor Chen Beisan, opened the court and tried the three defendants together. Li Quangen hired lawyer Shen Xingxia for his defense, and the hearing was adjourned to further review the facts, as detailed in previous reports. It is now known that Judge Qiu, who is presiding over the case, believes that the circumstances are serious and should be transferred to the local court for trial. Therefore, the case file was transferred to the president of the local court. At 10:00 AM yesterday, Wang Gangxu, the presiding judge of the criminal division, along with Chief Prosecutor Chen Beisan, opened a special court in the third courtroom upstairs. Lawyer Gu Shouxi appeared in court as the representative of the police. Lawyer Shen Xingxia, the defense attorney for the defendant Li Quangen, did not appear. After the court was declared open, the judge ordered the three defendants, Li, Liu, and Zheng, to be brought to the court to be questioned about their ages and hometowns.</p>
<p>Then, the police lawyer Gu Shouxi first explained the case and the articles of the criminal law under which Li Quangen was prosecuted, and submitted the letters and other items found on Li and in his home that Zheng had entrusted the guard Liu to deliver. Next, Prosecutor Chen stated the reasons for the prosecution, saying that the police lawyer had already detailed Zheng Tangsheng's intention to escape and Li Quangen's assistance in the escape plan. Regarding the guard Liu Ruiting's abuse of his position to transmit letters and collude for the prisoner, he is prosecuted under Article 175 of the criminal law. The court then ordered the defendants to be taken down for separate interrogation. First, Liu Ruiting was interrogated and testified that he had been a guard for two years, that he had delivered a letter for Zheng Tangsheng to Li Quangen, and had also mailed one for him. He had not spoken about anything else. As for whether guards can freely communicate with prisoners, he really didn't know. He had never discussed obtaining a gun with Zheng Tangsheng. He didn't know Zheng before. The written confession was given to him by another prisoner, A Si, who asked him to mail it on his behalf. He often went to the cell to deliver things. He didn't know Gao Lansheng, and there was no matter of worshipping the "old man". When asked whether Gao Lansheng's organization was a secret society or an assassination organization, Liu replied that he did not know. Then Li Quangen was brought to the court. He testified that he had known Zheng Tangsheng for a year, but they were not close friends. Zheng asked him to buy a pistol for suicide, not for escape. He didn't know the layout of the jail. Liu Ruiting came to his house once, but Zheng Tangsheng was not mentioned. Zheng Tangsheng testified that he had known Li Quangen for two years and Liu Ruiting for only three or four months. He asked Li to buy a pistol and nitric acid because he wanted to commit suicide, not escape. The layout of the jail was drawn by a prisoner who had been previously convicted. As for Liu Ruiting worshipping the "old man" Gao Lansheng, he heard it from others, and he didn't know about it. After the interrogation, the court reviewed the confessions and announced that the hearing would be adjourned to the afternoon of the eighth of this month for further interrogation. The defendants were returned to custody separately.</p>
