<h3>立法院通過批准白銀協定案</h3>
<p>附帶保留聲明免受恊定限制</p>
<p>批准後之困難問題</p>
<p>馬寅初發表談話公開徵求意見</p>
<p>（南京）　白銀協定批准問題、因因美提高銀價、轟動一時、且二十七日中政會審查會、以美提高銀價之對策、與批准協定爲截然兩事、經提廿八日中政會决議原則通過、交立法院審議、立法院奉咨後、交外財經三委會、於八日下午二時、開聨席審查會、馬寅初·陳長蘅·衞挺生·傅秉常·史維煥等十餘委、審查結果、認爲協定應予批准、惟須附帶保留聲明、卽如與「中國産業有危險時、中國得採必要之行動、」俾不致受恊定之限制與束縛、經擬具條文、提九日五十次院會秘密審議、詳加研討結果、照審查意見通過、附帶保留聲明、通過白銀恊定、（九日中央社電）</p>
<p>（南京）　立法院財政委員會委員長馬寅初、以白銀恊定批准後、如銀價繼漲、必有下列四問題發生、我應如何應付、頗爲困難、特公開徵求意見、（一）禁銀出口之困難、美提高銀價政策、已顯然可見、我批准恊定後、雖得附以保留聲明、恐不能抵抗其政策、我爲限止現銀外流起見、或有明令禁銀出口之必要、但自美提高銀價政策實行後、中美銀價已見差額、現相差百分之五、一旦我禁銀出口、其差額必更大、因我貿易入超甚鉅、平時華商購買美匯、如美匯匯價甚貴、可運現銀出口、以資抵償、則美匯不至甚貴、若禁銀出口、則美匯匯價之漲勢無以遏制、美金匯價漲、卽我銀幣匯價跌、亦卽我銀價更跌、結果中美銀價之差額更大、私運現銀出口者、豈不更有利可圖、恐禁不勝禁、故禁銀出口之功效甚少、不禁固流出、卽禁亦不能阻其流出、此點應如何對付、（二）徵收生銀出口稅之困難、卽不直接禁銀出口、或僅徵收相當之出口稅、以示限制徵收之額、當與中外銀價差額相當、在平時固可收限制出口之效、而現在銀價有繼漲之趨勢、顯然可見、如今日差額爲百分之五、下月或可漲至百分之十五、當我徵稅之初、假定中美銀價差額爲百分之五、徵收百分之五十出口稅、外商銀行縱須遵章繳納、彼等亦可盡量運出、暫時儲存香港等處、以俟機會、如漲至百分之十五時、始行運美、除去百分之五出口稅外、仍可賺百分之十之餘利、則限制之作用亦僅矣、此點應如何預防、（三）籌碼缺乏之可慮、外商銀行旣已運銀出口、庫存空虛、但在居入超地位、則華商久外商之貨欵、多於外商欠華商之貨欵、必由外商銀行向華商銀行提取現銀、以資抵補、則華商銀行之凖備金减少矣、信用基礎動摇、勢必收縮、籌碼日少、物價更跌、故我物價將受兩重影響、一因銀貴而跌、一因籌碼不足而跌、試問已陷恐慌之農工商業、尙堪受此壓迫耶、此點應如何預防、（四）外商銀行之狡計難防、最奇者外商銀行卽不自中國運出生銀、仍可將庫存現銀、賣與美政府、僅須封存庫中現銀、視爲美政府之寄存金可矣、俟將來有相當機會、再行運出、卽不運出美政府之目的仍可達到、因其目的不在使用而在封存、使銀價提高、故寄存中國視爲海外存金之一部、至我政府則以治外法權未收回、無權可以利用此項存金、故名義上現銀雖尙在中國、作用上則與運出無異、試問我又有何法可以强其價賣乎、此點又應如何應付、（九日中央社電）</p>
<p>（再京）　馬寅初九日對中央社記者發表個人對於應付銀價上漲之對策、首稱、白銀恊定與提高銀價、兩者有密切之關連、美提高銀價後、我爲銀本位國家、所受影響甚大、但恊定第四條規定、我國不得以溶幣之銀出賣、換言之、卽限制我於四年内不得改金本位、以四年之久、國際金融變遷、至如何程度、殊難臆揣、倘任其自然、物價加倍下降、外貨源源入口、農工商業均將破産、危險萬分、故批准恊定、附帶保留聲明、倘白銀漲至最高程度時、我可趁此時機、改爲金本位、以白銀易黄金後、我可免受他人宰割之苦、（九日中央社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>新生活運動與領袖　廷</h3>
<p>近來國内領袖提倡新生活運動異常熱烈。如豫劉魯韓揚朝氣湘何主張節約。都曾引起一般人的注意。不過號召力最大的。當然要推在蔣委員長領導下的南昌新生活運動。江浙兩省因爲中委陳立夫在杭州的迭次講演。亦頗感受些影響。</p>
<p>蔣委員長所提倡的新生活運動。注重將禮義廉恥表現到衣食住行上去就是説。要把民生和道德打成一片。禮義廉恥本是我國數千年來歷代賢哲「自立立人」的東西。不能説有什麽新的成分。但是照現在民族自信力的薄弱。人心的齷齪這確是對症良藥。而且由全國的中堅人。物躬親鼓吹。希望各界領袖「身體力行。」那是更值得注意的了。</p>
<p>我國民族本來有四個優點。爲其他民族所不及第一是講究和平。第二是極當於抵抗力第三是善於同化他人。第四是勤儉而樂觀。然而在當今環境下。這四個優點。竟不能平均發展。而只形成畸形的狀態。卽如「和平」與「抵抗」。似乎矛盾。其實則是由中庸哲學而形成的民族心理的表現。講究和平。本應採取積極的態度。而事實上竟流於消極。結果。因爲無法抵抗强隣的壓迫。便發生懊喪失望和畏懼退縮的弊病。這就是民族自信力衰落的鐵證。但這種不良現象。須由一小部人去負責决不能推諉於整個民族的不爭氣。更不能説中華民族「病入膏肓」而無可救藥了。我們在前幾天評論豫魯兩省的黎明運動曾説過。風俗的厚薄。其先實在是隨着領袖人物的存心而變動。一般老百姓。正和流水一樣。流東西全憑引導者的意嚮而左右。絶不能有自動的主張。如果引導的方向正確。細支旁流。可以匯爲巨川大河。奔騰而下。「沛然莫之能禦」藴藏於每滴水中的權威到了那時。才會集合發揮出來。我們以爲現在新生活運動的提倡。於其説是領袖們的「施行新猷。」母寗説是他們應盡的義務。不過轉過來説。這種首先提倡的義務。亦只有領袖們才能盡之而有力。那末。又不能不當做他們少數人所獨享的權利。權利和義務本是一件東西的兩面體相。權利由領袖們去享受。義務亦不容他們不盡。</p>
<p>最近蔣委員長曾説過。「過去革命所以没有成功。犧牲我們這樣多人才與志士。弄得國家還是這樣岌岌危殆。不可終日都是我們負責任的人。對於各種事情没有澈底研究清楚更没有實事求是地來做。犯了一切隨隨便便的毛病。」這幾句「罪己自責」的話。説得光明坦白。值得其他領袖們聽了一般的反覆思量澈底懺悔。</p>
<p>我們雖不必固執於「英雄造時勢」那一類的話。但是翻遍一部二十四史。發現多少治亂與亡的故事。大概在一個非常的時代。人的作用。大過於平時。中國歷史中復興民族的政治領袖。如漢武唐太宗之流。當其開基立業的初期。都靠着一兩件大事。號召人民。與人民相更始。又都覺得國家民族的興衰。以他一個人負責爲最重。所以很肯壓抑個人的地位與尊嚴。奬勵諍諫。廣開言路。把自己的錯誤。加以糾正。一個領袖「納諫如流」「聞過則喜」的精神越濃厚。他的成功越大。其造福於中國民族的前途。亦越深遠。</p>
<p>孫中山先生。鼓吹民族自信力的恢復。四十年如一日。而對於我國固有的「修齊治平。」的政治哲學特别推重。現在正在熱烈提倡中的新生活運動。目的在以我國固有的道德爲中心。喚起我們日益消沈的民族自信力。正和孫先生的遺敎相脗合。我們認爲是值得號召於全國人民之前的大事。新生活運動由國内中堅人物躬親鼓吹。而躬親鼓吹的人。又肯抱着認錯改過的態度。或者就是中華民族的大轉機。亦未可知。領袖們果眞肯「身體力行」脚踏實地的去幹。聞風興起的當不乏其人。轟動一時的新生活運動便會有成功的希望。</p>
<h3>英國政局之動向倫敦市選舉工黨大勝</h3>
<p>保守黨失勢自由黨慘敗</p>
<p>工黨第一次支配市議會</p>
<p>（倫敦）　倫敦市議會三年改選之期昨日屆滿、投票昨已開始、據現已發表之結果觀之、工黨得最大勝利、市議會計有一百二十四席、工黨現已獲有六十一席、市政改良黨得三十七席、餘二十六席尙未揭曉、倫敦市之選舉競爭極爲衆所重視、因國人對於政府之擁護與否、可由此而窺見也、市政改良黨此次喪失二十五席、其不能掌握政權殆已確定、查原有地位如下、市政改良黨八三席、工黨三五席、自由黨六席、市政改良黨在政策上與保守黨同、現未揭曉之二十六席究屬何黨、今日當可分曉、工黨此次施攻之點爲住屋問題、彼待謂倫敦市議會雖于一九三○年議定建築住屋二千所之程序、但已造之房屋爲數甚少、工黨主張掃除貧民窟、並設立花園城、工黨並主張增多富人之房租、藉以調劑貧民房租、（九日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　據最近消息、倫敦市選舉之結果、工黨又增三席、工黨得支配倫敦市議會、此爲歷史上第一次事、工黨歡忭可知、其領袖馬利遜、卽前運輸部大臣、今日聲稱、此次勝利至爲可喜、政策將有眞正更變云、市政改良黨領袖傑塞爾則責有選舉權者過于冷淡、致使工黨獲勝、共産黨候選市議員十六人皆落選、（九日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　昨日全國舉行市鎭自治機關選舉、工黨顯然獲得勝利、稱爲世界第一大部市之倫敦市政府從此入於工黨之手、且以前曾經舉行多次之衆議院補缺選舉、歷次選舉、均證明多少不利於國民内閣、最後更有一事足以注意者、卽自由黨在倫敦區之政治生命完全消失、在其他大部分之選舉區、自由黨亦僅成工黨之附庸而已、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　倫敦市議會選舉最後結果如下、工黨六九席、（前三五席）、市政改良黨五五席、（前八三席）、自由黨（前六席）無一獲選、新議會中有醫生十人、（九日路透電）</p>

<h3>日本名人武藤遭暗殺</h3>
<p>兇手因失業懐恨</p>
<p>（東京）　武藤山治、（現任時事新報社長本年六十七歲）、今晨九時十分、偕秘書兩人、在神奈川縣鎌倉别莊附近行路時、突有一怪漢出現、亂射手槍、傷武藤、射殺秘書一人、犯人當揚擊其自己胸部自殺、武藤中彈三發、現在鎌倉病院治療、被殺之秘書姓名青木亨（二十三歲）、當局推定犯人爲東京市荒川區尾久町福島新吉、電請東京警察署調查、</p>
<p>又電、武藤在脚部顎部及腹部受傷甚重、經當局調查之結果、犯人爲福島信吉、係一失業者、但與思想團體並無關係云、（九日日聨電）</p>
<p>（東京）　實業家武藤山治今晨在鎌倉别莊被帶手槍之暴漢射擊受重傷、生命甚危、按武藤氏爲日本財界政界著名人物、曾任晒最大紗廠鐘淵公司之社長、有四十年之久、鐘淵今日之繁榮全賴武藤社長、昭和四年辭職後、創設政治敎育會館、自大正一二年開始政治運動、組織實業同志會當選代議士三次、實業同志會後來改稱國民同志會、武藤現已引退政界、（九日日聨電）</p>
<p>鎌倉　武藤山治當遇刺之時、由警官询其原因、武藤因苦悶難堪、未便詳談、僅謂「原因乃火葬塲問題、詳情請問佐久間君」、於是鎌倉警署急傳武藤氏之秘書佐久間君到署、當由該秘書陳述、謂原因起於私憤、犯人福島於去年五六月間計畫設立火葬塲於坎尾久地方、要求武藤氏捐欵、武藤則拒絶之、其後武藤氏復發表設立火葬塲計畫、福島聞之甚爲憤恨、遂决計殺害武藤、以瀉私忿、福島此次亦持有上項情形之記事云、（九日日聨電）</p>
<p>鎌倉　狙擊武藤山治之兇犯福島新吉、曾任京橋機械公司之事務員、現因失業、依賴其妻芳子之勞働生活、决意行兇、昨夜忽在家飲酒、後携同妻子四人、往附近之電影院觀影戲、暗與其妻告别、至其行兇之動機、經調查其妻後、背後似無團體、兇犯於去年五六月圖在尾久設立火葬塲、曾往謁見武藤、請求捐金、但被武藤拒絶、且妨礙其事業、故深恨武藤、最近因失業生活益困苦、乃出擊武滕云、（九日電通電）</p>
<h3>美當局抨擊日本海軍競爭</h3>
<p>充實軍力維持國際和平</p>
<p>毋越條約限度各國責任</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　日本大角海相宣言、日本將增造軍艦、以與美國海軍抗衡、今日此間議會及海軍界聞之大爲驚駭、爲答復大角之言論起見、喬治亞州議員文生氏（卽文生特拉曼議案之提議者）宣稱、美國造艦計劃並未越出海軍條約之範圍、文生氏繼稱、吾儕造艦計劃、目的在於排除海軍競爭之各種疑雲、吾人之議案、志在完成我方對於條約所許可之國際均勢責任、無論國内或國外、吾未見有反對此計劃之理由、伊利諾州議員白利登爲主張大海軍案者主要人物之一、亦不信美國將從事海軍競爭、白利登之言曰、除非英日自動破壞與吾人締結之莊嚴條約、吾人不欲越出條約之範圍、倘英日兩國中任何一國、以吾儕之造艦計劃爲可異、則爲表示彼等對於吾人不信任之明證、海軍作戰長官史登賚大將則稱、各國道德的義務在維持條約所許之充分海軍實力、史登賚氏繼稱、凡屬倫敦或華盛頓條約之簽約國、應保全彼等充分之海軍力、以維持國際和平與安全之相當均勢、結束前次世界大戰之和約並未能解决大戰以後之許多國際困難、在遠東則尤甚、各國之責任在母超越條約之限度、余意、維持條約所許之充分海軍力、亦爲各國之義務、苟各國政府任其海軍力削弱、則國際均勢和平與安全、必將爲之動摇矣、（八日國民電）</p>
<h3>美日海軍比較</h3>
<p>（東京）　美國參院議員文生氏提議之海軍擴大案已經通過上下兩院、本案完成之時期、卽一九三九年、美國海軍之勢力如次、</p>
<p>主力艦　十五艘　四五五·四○○噸</p>
<p>航空母艦　六艘　一三五·○○○噸</p>
<p>甲級巡洋艦　十八艘　一七二·六五○噸</p>
<p>乙級巡洋艦　十九艘　一五七·六○○噸</p>
<p>驅逐艦　九十七艘　一五○·○○○噸</p>
<p>潛水艦　四十艘　五二·五九○噸</p>
<p>共計　一九五艘　一·一二三·二四○噸</p>
<p>其與日本第二次補充計劃完成期卽一九三六年之勢力比較、則其比率爲主力艦六成、航空母艦六成二、甲級巡洋艦六成二、乙級巡洋艦七成三、驅逐艦六成七、潛水艦十成、故日本於一九三六年軍縮條約滿期後、更要增建各種軍艦、（九日日聨電）</p>
<h3>美國衆議院通過陸軍預算</h3>
<p>共二萬九九千一百萬元</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　陸軍預算、政府要求額係三四九·五二三·○○○元、經衆院預算委員會修正爲二七九·五四一·○○○元、并允另撥欵項、以充航空經費、其總數共合二九一·○○○·○○○元、本日衆議院業將預算委員會修正案表决通過、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>法國擴充海軍</h3>
<p>巡艦一驅逐艦一潛水艇二</p>
<p>（巴黎）　日前海軍部長庇特利提出一九三四年海軍造艦程序、要求建造「鄧開克」號式裝甲巡洋艦一艘·驅逐艦一艘及潛水艇兩艘、總計各艦排水量達三萬噸左右、海軍委員會討論此案、頃已提出報告、主張將此案迅速予以通過、謂本年造艦噸位較之一九二二年至一九三二年每年平均數額爲低、實爲維持法國應有海軍軍力之最低限度、「鄧開克」號式第二艘裝甲巡洋艦係爲兩艘主力艦、平均分配之所必須、至於驅逐艦及兩潛水艇、則係替代年齡屆滿之舊艦云（八日哈瓦斯）</p>
<h3>我國軍事考察團參觀蘇俄軍事組織</h3>

<h3>國聨對軍縮抱最後成功希望</h3>
<p>英允共同制裁違反公約</p>
<p>法輿論不反對德置軍備</p>
<p>日内瓦發表法外長來函</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　國聨對於軍縮現抱最後成功之希望、因英國已改變態度、對於違反軍縮公約者、贊成採取共同行動、又聞法國有勢力之輿論、對於德國重整軍備問題、亦已轉變、</p>
<p>今日此間發表軍縮問題之白皮書、内載法外長巴爾都來函、以簡明之語調申説法國之態度、並説明談判陷入僵局之原因、謂凡確有軍事性質之組織而不視爲軍隊、則非法國所能接受、如受和約軍事條欵束縳之國得立卽重置軍備、而他國反需立卽裁减軍備、此亦非法國所可贊同、該函又陳説破壞軍縮公約時有担保之必要、並謂現有若干國不顧和約之規定、方積極重置軍備、此事宜有迅速之解决云、</p>
<p>美國於二月十九日送交英大使之備忘錄、贊成一月二十九日之英國軍縮説帖、並主張一面縮减攻勢軍備、一面增厚弱國之防守軍備、該備忘錄提議、（一）廢除重砲隊·大坦克車·轟炸機·及用於侵略之同樣軍器、（二）繼續的自動檢查軍備、（三）締結普遍不侵略公約、該備忘錄又聲明、美政府决不與聞歐洲政治問題、故不參加關於此種問題之外交討論、但美政府甚注意維持歐洲和平是以歡迎英政府之努力、美政府完全與英國一致、認軍縮公約不獨爲必要、且以便利一般政治之緩和、該備忘錄末稱、美政府希望英國之説帖可導成軍縮談話之復活云、預料法國下星期可答覆二月九日英國之建議、定可獲得進步、以便利軍縮之談判也、（九日路透電）</p>
<h3>法閣議討論對英覆文</h3>
<p>下星期一可以送出</p>
<p>（巴黎）　今日聞法外部對英國軍縮備忘錄之復文將於下星期一發出、係以婉言拒絶英國之提議、（九日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　今日閣議由總統勒白倫主席、席間外長巴爾都竭兩小時之力、將外交情形作詳細之報告、其中所關旣鉅且廣、故已將應行討論各點改於下星期一第二次閣議討論、屆時外長巴爾都將詳答一切質問、今晚巴氏宣稱、已决將下星期一比京之行改期、因下星期一須出席閣議也、據政界消息、深信外長之改訂行期、係俟比外長發表軍縮宣言之風潮過後再往比京、因據比京近訊、比外長之宣言已引起比國國民黨與社會黨間之衝突、且恐將牽連及内閣也、又法國軍事委員會亦於今日下午開會討論對英國軍縮備忘錄之覆文云、（八日國民電）</p>
<h3>鮑爾温表示歐局尙未絶望</h3>
<p>各國空軍平等避免危險</p>
<p>在伊拉克設空軍根據地</p>
<p>（倫敦）　英政府航空次官沙遜今日在下院提出空軍預算案、内有一條、以六萬五千鎊、在伊拉克國狄板地方建築空軍新根據地、沙遜謂天空警備至有效力、並詳述用以肅清叛變之方法、謂先加警告、有時在天空用傳聲器發出警告、此舉大都有效、如不能能鎭攝、則擲落假炸彈以示警、至於眞炸彈則不輕易施用、土人常有聚衆作亂、但因見飛機巡邏而遂逃散者云、樞密院大臣包爾温言及此預算時、謂近有以掌璽大臣艾登游歐失敗爲言者、渠不能贊同、此行尙未有結果、但渠絶未放棄根據英國軍縮計劃成立公約之希望、此約可使各國空軍彼此平等、渠知此乃避免危險之必要條件也、如竟不能締成公約、政府終不鬆懈其謀取西歐諸國恊定以保全歐洲文明之努力、渠不承認今日時局業已絶望、但若各種努力盡成泡影、而此平等不能實現、則英政府將使英空軍不落於他國之後云、（八日路透電）</p>
<h3>比外長重申軍縮立塲</h3>
<p>德軍備限制應變通</p>
<p>法比意見實無衝突</p>
<p>不魯塞爾　外長希孟在參議院發言、謂各報所載評論、對於日前勃洛克維爾總理之軍縮問題宣言及彼在參院之演説、率多誤解、外長繼謂、「吾人所恃者乃比國人民之常識、若謂吾人贊成德國重整軍備則無人能信之、吾人對於此事向不發一言、一般人以爲必須强制德國依照凡爾賽條約之限制解除軍備、此説雖言之成理、然若于大國則主張此種限制應酌量變通、以適應目前之局勢、今吾人若取强硬態度不許通融、則不免驕矜立異、又爲事實所難能、所足幸者、法比兩國對於此事意見完全一致、凡一切足以引起戰爭之武力解决方法均爲法比兩國之所摒斥、法比兩國均許德國置有軍隊、但應加審愼之限制、並受切實之監察、此外法比兩國並經同意、如遇破壞已訂定之規律時、應施以制裁、且在無論何時、均應團結行動、如是方足以制止德國之非法重整軍備云云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>不魯塞爾　據天主敎機關報二十世紀報所載、有一熟諳比國内政外交之某要人發表宣言、謂勃洛克維爾總理曾公開表示、對於凡爾賽條約中軍事條欵之價值深懐疑慮、以爲此種條欵不足以資保障、故比國有權别謀補充之法、卽如增加萊茵河公約之效力、使該約所規定萊茵河左岸成爲撤廢軍備區域、及由法英意三國保障比國安全等欵、均應見諸實施是也云云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>國聨向各國建議取締主戰播音</h3>
<p>訂約管理國際無綫電</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　提議國際管理播音以禁止主戰言論之國際播音草約、已由國聨行政院送交各國、徵求同意、爲使無綫電成爲維持和平之有效工具起見、此約將設置無綫電節目之嚴密檢查、尤以新聞及政治的播音爲甚、凡屬播音公司、當從事禁止啓發戰爭情緒及激動國際衝突之各種消息、彼等亦當保證各種國際關係情報之正確、參加此條約之各國政府、當遵守破壞國際播音規則之嚴厲懲罰、懲罰辦法尙在擬議中、有人提議、現時各國政府、在播音規則受有組織的破壞時、當取消播音公司之特許證書或權利、此條約之成立、國際智識合作會、實與有力、管理政治播音久已在國際智識合作會之意念中、如從慕尼黑傳出之消息、奥國則視爲蓄意破壞其國内治安、擬議中之國際播音規則如下、（一）無論何種電報、如蓄意爲某國而發、搆成某國國内安全之危害者、皆在禁止之列、（二）不准播發挑釁之消息、（三）各種消息之足以影響國際合作者應禁止之、（四）時勢緊張時、實行嚴密之檢查、（五）關於不正確之消息立卽加以糾正、（六）國家宣傳應含和平節目、此種節目包括外國民族之生活狀况、民族間相互關係之發達、及有關和平之組織、（七）政府對於國家播音、當頒布和平規則、（八）倘無綫電糾紛、非外交常規所能解决時、當訴之於海牙最高法庭、或國際智識合作委員會云、各國政府得於一九三四年八月前提出意見、一九三一年九月二十四日國聨大會卽有决議、主張國際智識合作會、對引起之各種國際問題、足以影響良好之國際關係者、加以調查、軍縮會議關於道德的裁軍問題亦被喚起注意、以爲無綫電應造福和平云、（八日國民電）</p>
<h3>意國注意多瑙河政策</h3>
<p>德否認巴本赴羅馬</p>
<p>羅馬　此間各界對於意國之多瑙河政策甚爲注意、然關於政治不安之謡傳仍未停止、至將來意匈奥三國間會議之結果、據云、三頭會議僅以討論經濟各問題爲限、卽或有涉及政治之處、亦不過關於多瑙河流域之經濟建設而已、聞談判時將以意國去年之提案爲根據、此項提案、不但關於三國之經濟合作、且普及於沿多瑙河流域之其他各國、故外間臆測及反對之謡傳實屬過慮云、（九日國民電）</p>
<p>（柏林）　外傳德副總理巴本將乘奥匃兩國總理在羅馬與意首相墨索里尼談判之時赴意一行、以與奥總理杜爾夫斯有所商榷云云、今日政府方面特發表正式宣言、否認此事、其原因則爲巴本近日時感不適、且職務繁劇、巴本刻正臥病在家、今日下午總理希特勒曾親往探視云、（八日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　今日西門外相延見德國大使赫許、赫氏不日將返國一行、本日西門係以軍縮談判情形告之、此間負責人士確稱、西相未向赫氏提出任何新建議云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦電訊、據此間報載、奥總揆陶爾夫斯與匈牙利首相將連袂赴意、羅馬方面已表示歡迎、羅馬各報咸料意奥匈三國間將成三國恊商、並歌頌墨索尼亞氏鞏固巴爾幹和平基礎之意、而捷克與巨哥斯拉夫則以奥匈兩總揆之赴意表示驚恐、並表示寗見國社黨得勢於奥國、捷克與巨哥斯拉夫兩國當然反對主張修改列能條約諸國之結合、蓋該約之訂立、捷巨兩國爲主要之獲利者、而匈牙利則失去領士不少、並不得國聨之同意、應維持其獨立之規定、復意奥匈三國之結合、其根</p>
<h3>希特勒犯破壞文明罪</h3>
<p>紐約人大開玩笑</p>
<p>德大使抗議無效</p>
<p>（紐約）　昨夜紐約瑪狄遜大街公園舉行假審判、以德總理希特勒爲被告、參加此假審判者有律師多人、觀者極衆、訴訟進行亦莊亦諧、檢察官二十人、内有紐約現任市長拉迦狄亞與前任市長史密士二人、結果判定希特勒犯有破壞文明之罪、判詞宣佈時、衆鼓掌報之、歷時頗久、德國駐美大使路德博士今日因此事向白宫提出抗議、指爲侮辱德國國家與其總理、請懲負責人、此事現交國務院辦理、聞國務院已予答覆、略稱、政府人員未有參加此假審判者、故政府未能有何舉動云（八日路透電）</p>
<p>本目的在制止德國在奥國及中歐之企圖、故德國亦表示反對、</p>
<p>同時奥總揆陶爾夫斯力圖實現基督徒組合國家之理想、並於昨日（四日）慶祝解散奥大利國會之一週紀念、陶氏在考林西亞向二萬五千農民演説中稱、奥國新憲法將於最近期内頒布、陶氏並贊揚工人、緣最近社會黨起事時奥國工人之矢忠政府者佔百分之九十、陶氏並稱、奥國凖備與匈牙利成立互惠關稅、但母須成立關稅同盟也、吾人已獲得奥國福利之基礎、目下奥國已能自立而不須依賴他人矣、</p>
<p>此間及歐洲各國都市、對於陶氏能否勝過其部下要員如副總揆哀密爾費、内衞軍總司令史泰漢堡王子等、頗多揣測、衆知陶氏反對嚴處近頃亂事上被捕之社會黨份子、而費氏及史泰漢堡親王俱主張嚴處奥國社黨預料國社黨黨員將大有增加、惟奥工人恐國社黨報復行爲者頗衆、奥匈兩總揆將於三月十二日左右抵羅馬、此次奥匈兩總揆之赴意、其主要目的已經正式宣布、係與墨氏會商墨氏所提出多腦河各國經濟辦法之計劃、但此次意奥匈三總揆之會商、結果意大利或能贊成恢復奥匈帝國、此項步驟、必遭反對、蓋恢復奥匈帝國必同時附有奥匈邊境建築防禦工事之要求云、（外論社）</p>
<h3>奥内閣將改組</h3>
<p>法西斯領袖與總理爭權</p>
<p>内衞軍歸杜爾夫斯統率</p>
<p>維也納　奥總理杜爾夫斯與内衞軍總司令史泰漢堡親王間之爭權欲將現内閣重加改組一節、其結果如何雖未正式公布、但其進展之程度確已日就明晰、大約農民團之首領前任内部部長巴興吉氏將仍入閣爲内長、杜爾夫斯自兼内部已久、此次將不得不讓步也、至史泰漢堡氏之私人軍隊、卽内衞軍、此後將歸杜氏統率、而斯氏則入閣爲一不管部閣員云、現在之宣傳委員會將加組爲部云、（八日國民電）</p>
<p>維也納　農民聨合會自去年秋間、因前内閣副總理温克萊之職業團體陣綫與陶爾斐斯總理之愛國陣綫發生衝突以來、卽不過問國事、但目前農民聨合會因欲獲得若干地位、已重行積極參加政治生活、加林蒂省前省長凱爾美向與國社黨有關、已提出辭職、而由該省愛國同盟團領袖赫爾蓋德將軍繼任省長、此舉已闢一新局面、蓋農民聨合會欲與國社黨完全斷絶關係、而與政府黨重圓破鏡、已於比顯示其、志願矣、聞農民聨合會現正考慮在短時期内、自行宣告解散、而加入愛國陣綫、因此政界消息靈通者均以爲此舉瑕引起一問題、卽農民聨合會或有重行入閣之可能、并將推舉一候補閣員、此外本月十三日陶爾斐斯啓程赴羅馬之前、内閣或將改組、外間傳聞甚盛、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>歐洲金本位制的現狀（倫敦通信）</h3>
<p>金本位不免動摇</p>
<p>法蘭西竭力維持</p>
<p>去年的世界經濟會議開會之前、我們都曉得所謂國際合作的調子唱得很高、有許多人對此、存着莫大的希望、以爲整個問題、雖是無法解决、而技術的部分、總可以得到表面的結論、不料開首遇着國際通貨穩定、就發生大波瀾、國際合作、由此宣告失敗、國際糾紛、從引激化了、英國早已抛棄了金本位制、且不用說她、美國也凖備用通貨膨脹政策來制服她國内的恐慌、於是歐洲飲過膨脹通貨苦水的各國、纔着手聨絡一氣、當時參加這個聨盟的是法蘭西·意大利·比利時·荷蘭·瑞士、波蘭·等六國、共同目的是在死守着金本位制、形成歐洲的經濟聨盟、而以法國爲中心、</p>
<p>現在美國已經正式宣告减低美金所含純金分量了、問題可說是十分嚴重、金本位制的前途、也可以說是十分危急、然則今後將如何變遷、却是值得此們注意的問題、照目前情形看、她們大概還不致於在短時期内抛棄金本位、其理由如下、</p>
<p>（一）　法比荷瑞四個經濟上比較有强力的國家、都還保持着巨額現金、法國有八百億法郎、比國有二十七億比爾加（Ｂelga）、荷蘭有七億六千八百萬佛羅令、瑞士也有差不多八億法郎、并且她們的對外短期投資都很少、所以國内資本向外逃避、還不至十分激烈、她們因此尚有維持金本偐的實力、</p>
<p>（二）　金本位聨盟六國中、有四國是深感通貨膨脹苦痛的、她們的國民、都强烈的反對紙幣政策、設使一旦停止金本位制、當然通貨膨脹政策、就會跟着來、於是政治鬭爭會越見激劇、暴動也恐怕要發生、罷工和其他擾亂社會秩序的行動、都不敢必其無有、這都是德法諸國過去所有過的經騐、現時當然不肯再來冒險、</p>
<p>（三）　歐洲大陸、曾經實行過通貨膨脹政策的國家、安定了通貨、也還没有幾年、將膨脹政策失去了的信用取回來、并没有多久、如果停止金本位制的話、就會再失信用、所以她們現在都想固定金本位制的信用、反之卽是反對採用停止金本位制、</p>
<p>然而法國却阴一個重大的矛盾、一則是現金流出之不可輕視、再則去年有形貿易入超、差不多有一萬萬法郎、三則對外投資、也逐漸收回、利息收入、當然要减少、因此法郎逃往國外的、自去年以來、竟有六十餘億、這數目確是不可輕易看過的、何况法國曾努力設法防止現金的埋藏、增加船舶一類的收人、但是世界經濟、并不曾眞正好轉、則法國當然不能避免其惡劣影響、所以金本位的維持、也不是容易的事、在另一方面、法郎的現金凖備率、還有百分之九十二、一般中層分子、又擁護金本位制、政治則傾向於强力内閣、那末金本位似還可以延續若干時日、</p>
<p>荷蘭在歐洲算是比較堅實的國家、但自去年以來、輸出入貿易、比較一九二九年、差不多跌落了三分之一、去年春初物價向下跌落、到了冬天、纔用人爲的方法、勉强提高了百分之五、實質上并無何等改正、她的養命之源、是荷蘭東印度羣島的市塲、在一九二九年的時候、她對當地占輸入的第一位、但是到去年、這市塲就被日本貨品所奪占、日貨輸入荷蘭東印度、竟占全輸入的百分之五十六、把荷蘭反而擠到第二位去了、因此她國内失業繼續增加、紡織工業與炭坑、都發生恐慌、近來纔有和英國聨盟抵制日貨的提議、</p>
<p>比利時在財政上算是能保持平衡的國家、其現金凖備額、也能維持二十六億比爾加以上的水凖、則是支持金本位制的國家、法國之外、要算比國了、</p>
<p>瑞士是金本位諸國中最弱的一環、第一是財政困難、去年收入不足約及一億法郎、對外貿易難關、也因爲該國所製造的鐘表、不易暢消、所以輸出貿易總是衰落、其實瑞士所靠的是外國遊歷客人的收入、一則因爲瑞士物價比歐洲任何國家都高、再則經濟情形不好、所以遊人稀少、瑞士旅館業關門、現時竟至於牽聨到銀行的金融週轉、</p>
<p>歐洲金本位國中的德國、已經是朝不保夕、意大利也很難撑持、單靠法國總是不行的、經濟的不安、將來是很容易影響到政治的、（一九三四年二月二日於倫敦）</p>
<h3>齋藤内閣前途的研究（日本通信）</h3>
<p>各黨派的割據</p>
<p>後繼人的推測</p>
<p>日本政局的演變、自岡本氏露骨質問之後、引起政治上絶大的波瀾、現雖岡本氏查問鳩山一郎受賄案、可告一段落、但是齋藤内閣並不因此穩固、政黨分裂運動、反而越見明顯、鳩山現在已經辭職、文相的職務、由齋藤暫時兼任、齋藤内閣確是没有倒臺、不過攻擊者還在進行、鐵相三土問題又要起來了、所以齋藤内閣總辭職的事、仍舊在積極醖釀中、現在來講後繼内閣、大概不算是没有意義罷、</p>
<p>繼齋藤内閣之後、有人說將由齋藤再拜大命組閣、有人說將由現在朝鮮總督宇垣一成繼任、有人說將由平沼騏一郎組閣、還有高橋是清·近衞大磨、一木喜德郎·都有拜命組閣的可能、</p>
<p>齋藤實所以能够維持到現在的原故、一則因爲他是海軍界的耆宿、在軍部中人望、有相當的好感、再則他個人度量很大、確實能够包容、而且調和於陸海軍之間、對於立憲政治、也不作過度的摧殘、還保持着議會政治的顔面、對資本家、也不十分苛刻、因此他在政潮動堂盪中、總能勉强渡過去、</p>
<p>候補的有力人物、首先要講到的、是宇垣一成、他是日本軍界元老當中田中義一而後的第一人、他差不多自己形成了岡山系、在將官階級的大體都擁護他、民政黨方面、與他也很圓滿、在民政黨屬下的代議士、又情願捧他、不過軍部底下的佐官陛級丨丨卽大佐·中佐·少佐·日本人呌作中堅階級丨丨、對他却非常的不滿、其不滿的原因、第一是宇垣與政黨接近、不直軍閥之所爲、第二是宇垣主張保存議會政治、於軍人獨裁運動、頗不方便、所以中堅階級、寗願擁立荒木或眞崎而不肯擁宇垣、那末民政黨縱然熱心捧他、結果還是不得上臺、因爲日本軍部的實權、差不多都在中堅階級手裏、如果中堅階級反對、政治上必然更多困難、現在中堅階級中人、能否改變態度、那就不可知了、</p>
<p>其次有力的人物、是世所共知的平沼騏一郎、平沼運動組閣的中心、是國本社和與國本社有關的右翼各團體、在陸軍當中的林銑十郎、在海軍方面的加藤寛治、都對他表示好感、以樺山資英（貴族院議員）中的薩派、也强調倡所謂平沼主義爲平沼帮忙、但是平沼主義、倡來這樣久、仍舊不能登台、其原因爲他和元老重臣的關係不好、尤其是西園寺公望主張憲政常道論的一般人、對他更壞、但牧野伸顯内府、對平沼却持相當的好感、在衆議院方面中野正剛所領的國民同盟一部分的人、對平沼亦表好感的、卽床次系有些人、也肯捧平沼、這次政友會發生内訌後、久原房之且一流人、也與平沼通聲氣、因此平沼組閣的樂觀論、近來又漸抬頭了、</p>
<p>再次、貴族當中人望最好、政治手腕也强的、要算是近衞文磨了、照目前的情形、如果近衞組織超然内閣的話、在兩院中都没有問題、不過在元老重臣方面、以爲近衞誠然是才堪大用、但是在目前這種混沌局面底下、似乎不必犧牲他、所以近衞内閣的實現性、現在並不多、</p>
<p>一木喜德郎·在日本政治界、也是一個適當的首相、不過因爲倫敦條約問題、與軍部問意見、至今並未圓滿、現時是軍人支与一切的時候、一木組閣、因此更難成事實、</p>
<p>至於清浦奎吾内閣、實質上與齋藤很相似、荒木組閣、現在更不是時期、鈴木　三郎·若槻禮次郎·等人、如果以政黨領袖出臺、那是實現的可能性更少了、（一九三四年三月一日於東京）</p>
<h3>孫殿英部將歸晋方收編</h3>
<p>富占魁約孫在磴口會晤</p>
<p>盧豐年建議孫部投晋方</p>
<p>北平通訊、孫展英事件、截至現在、依然以軍事解决成分爲多、富占魁現在黄楊木頭停留、曾致電孫殿英、約孫在磴口會晤、但孫迄無覆電、因是晋軍有最近期間向磴口推進之訊、至磴口方面孫部之盧豐年、日前派代表俞木星來平、謁何應欽、表示可促孫離軍、但希望所部交由晋方收編、今晨（八日）據軍分會發言人稱、當局對孫部辦法、始終不變原定主張、如能做到孫殿英離軍、孫部撤返原防、遵照軍分會令照備案額數縮編、則該部由晋方收編、亦未始不可云、闻俞木星在平、約有三數日勾留、卽行離平、</p>
<p>自傳作義返綏後、對軍事進行益急、留綏後方部隊、已掃數向西開動、以大部兵力向磴口進、在富占魁孫殿英晤商未有結果前、對孫部將作最大威脅、以期該部就範、傅作義軍部全體人員、均已抵包、綏東各部向西出動後、遺防由李服膺部周元健旅接塡　至担任前鋒之王靖國部第七十師徐子珍團、確曾與孫軍彭振旅騎兵一千餘人、發生接觸、彭旅不支、向西退去、徐團遂將該處佔領、此爲晋綏軍與孫部之第一次衝突、徐團略加整理後、復恊同趙承綬部騎兵·及第二○五旅·二一五旅·各部、按照原定計畫、積極向西進、及抵黄圖拉亥河附近、又發現孫部千餘人、據守抵抗、經晋綏軍一度砲火猛擊、孫部又不支、向西南方面潰竄、晋綏軍跟踪猛追、此爲第二次衝突、現晋綏軍前鋒、已迫至磴口、與孫部第一一九師盧豐年部對峙、如孫與富占魁晤面、仍無結果時、晋綏軍卽進攻磴口、傳孫本人、已對人表示願意離軍、並遵令縮編所部、惟對該部開赴青海屯墾一事、仍力主實現、俾得生路、孫部師長盧豐年、曾向孫建議、卽將孫所轄全部統歸晋方改編、以免四散、孫對此亦頗表同情、將來孫離軍時、或將全部交盧統率、投歸晉方改編、且盧豐年與孫爲同鄉、十餘年前、曾在晉軍任師長、去年經孫委爲該部第一一九師師長、與晉方亦有好感也、</p>
<p>平軍分會某委員談、赴磴口晤孫展英之富占魁、已到黄楊木頭、正向磴口前進中、孫展英確在寗垣附近之滿達橋一帶惟孫已令所部轉知到達磴口之軍分會參謀黎明、謂卽返磴、與富相晤、無論孫氏是否接受勸告離軍、預料富孫兩氏如能會見、當有進展、軍事當局、因孫態度内爍、和平解决無相當把握、對軍事凖備、始終積極進行、寗垣一帶戰况、事實不如外傳之甚、雙方僅有小接觸而已、軍分會方面、因對孫問題、昨戰步驟、均已决定、惟視富占魁晤孫結果如何、卽依旣定計畫實行、（八日）</p>

<h3>又一證明德國否認僞滿</h3>
<p>同濟大學方面所得消息</p>
<p>昨據同濟大學翁校長聲稱、關於德國承認僞滿謡傳、渠等曾一再向德國各機關收集消息、向學校方面面報告、據云、前德國海洋社、於二月二十六日來電述、「德人有承認滿洲國之傳說、絶對否認、並切實聲明、所有一切外不確之消息、絶無根據、顯係奸人造謡、意圖中傷中德感情、」且德公使亦有書面聲明、謂德國絶無承認滿洲國之意思云云、前日本校學生原擬發電忠告德政府、現因德政府已將此項謡傳、明白解釋、亦已中止發電、總之、中德邦交素洽、就德敎授所得消息觀之、謡傳實不足置信也、</p>

<h3>滬銀行界調劑農村金融</h3>
<p>先後成立農村貸欵部</p>
<p>上海銀行一年之成績</p>
<p>中央社云、年來國内災禍頻仍、致現金集中於都市、農村經濟、日漸衰落、本市銀行界有鑒於此、故最近已從事於農村經融之調劑、如上海商業儲蓄銀行等、業已先後成立農村貸欵部、並向全國各地設立分部、茲將該行農村貸欵部一年來成績、誌之如次、</p>
<h3>調劑農村關係全國</h3>
<p>考農村經濟衰落之主因、由於農民金融之不能調劑、農産品之不能暢銷、挽救之策、應將都市資金、移入内地、使農村金融、得以流通、同時改良運銷制度、使農産暢銷、如是、則農民經濟寛裕、購買力增高、市塲因之興盛、工商隨之發達、所以調劑農村金融、其關係所及、豈僅農民、實全國整個之問題、本市上海商業儲蓄銀行等、有鑒於農村金融調劑之急要、業已成立農村貸欵部、並已在南京鄭州長沙等地、設立分部、今後將逐漸推廣、</p>
<h3>放出各欵如期收回</h3>
<p>該行農村貸欵部、雖於去年一月間正式成立、然於最初六月中、欵項出入、爲數甚微、至八月間業務漸盛、放欵亦大、所放欵項、計運銷用欵四十二萬八千六百四十二元、信用放欵三十萬六千四百三十二元、倉庫用欵二十八萬七千五百二十一元、共計一百零二萬二千五百九十六元、所放各欵、除未到期之欵外、皆能如期收回、（其中先期歸還者甚多）</p>
<h3>各大銀行先後貸欵</h3>
<p>至於各該地農民所獲到之利益、其最著者、當者、當推、（一）鄉間金融得以流通、（二）在鄉間金融周轉不靈之時、以前借貸欵項、利率甚高、甚至有月息三分至四五分者、貸欵部成立後、貸欵農民、免受重利之壓迫、（三）農民每因缺乏資金、致種種事業、不易興辦、得經濟上輔助後、各種事業完成者甚多、故本市各大銀行、决將其投資地産之資金、從事於各地農民金融、調劑事業、俾農民經濟寛裕後、而銀行本身營業、亦得以蒸蒸日上也、聞交通銀行·浙江興業銀行·等亦將在各埠籌設農村貸欵部、以裕農民經濟云、</p>
<h3>實部籌備中三大工廠近况</h3>

<h3>硫酸錏廠開工建築</h3>
<p>硫酸錏、與英國卜内門業部、與曲國卜内門公司·德國藹奇公司·三方合辦、資本定爲一千五百萬元、旋因英德方面所提條件苛刻作罷、實部以該項工廠各種設施、關係我國工業前途及國防頗巨、决定改由國人經營後、當由實業家范旭東、與實部接洽一切承辦手續、並决定將資本一千五百萬元、暫行减至七百萬、以利進行、茲悉實業部長陳公博、業將創辦該廠詳細計劃、提出行政院一五○次會議討論結果、對維持製鹹部分豁免稅厘减低運費等、業經審查通過、至發行公債五百五十萬元一節、責令實部查明該廠已繳股欵及負債數目後、依法辦理、並闻該廠計劃、自經行政院通過後、當卽積極進行籌備、並已覓定南京浦口甲甸地方爲廠址、業於前日開始建築、限於一年内全部完成、開工製造、</p>
<h3>造紙廠借欵已通過</h3>

<h3>中央機廠在滬覓地</h3>
<p>中央機器廠、自經實部籌劃以來、大致業已就緒、並與中央庚欵會接洽、借用十二萬三千二百鎊、以資採辦機器、至廠址問題、前經决定在南京下關草鞋峽、嗣以該處地勢低窪、非塡土中高、不能適用、經測勘計算後、地價尚屬有限、塡土工程浩大、需費二十九萬餘、旋經多方考慮結果、决將該廠移至工業較爲發達之上海、俾將來出品、便利銷售、茲悉實部已覓定吳淞鎭東南之空地、約五十畝、該處水陸交通、均稱便利、現正在進行估價收買一切手續、俾於最近期内、動工興築、</p>
<h3>交海財參各部昨開引水會議</h3>
<p>討論結果一時尚難發表</p>
<p>新聲社云、我國引水權、向由外人操縱、近雖交涉收回、國人亦有陸續任領港者、然外籍領港、並未完全解雇、仍多繼續任用、交通部等鑒於無形喪失主權、特於昨日下午三時、在江海關召集引水會、海軍部海政司長許繼祥·交通部航政司長高廷梓·及參謀本部財政部等代表、均來滬出席、會商逐漸遞减外籍引水人員、考用國人接充、俾實際上達到完全收回目的、昨日會議結果、據航政司長高廷梓對新聲社記者表示、内容因未至發表時期、未便相告、至交通部航政會議、現定於本月二十日在京舉行、各方提案改革政意見頗多、大會時將逐項提出討論、使國内航業、得以刷新云、</p>

<h3>棉業編制會派員至陜散發棉籽</h3>
<p>滯留靈寳棉籽不日可抵西安</p>
<p>山西湖南兩省計劃改良棉種</p>
<p>全國經濟委員會棉業統制會、前應陜西省政府建設廳之請、與該省合組棉業改進處、改良陜省棉種、棉統會鑒於全國産棉、不敷供給國内紗廠之需要、以致外棉得侵入我國市塲、金錢外溢、實堪痛心、故擬竭力推行各省、致力種棉、茲誌各情如下、</p>
<p>購改良種、陜省府自與棉業統制會合組棉業改進處後、積極籌備改良棉種、故委托棉統會、向河南彰德採購美種棉籽、共計四千四百擔、由該會輸送至靈寳、因陜省府困於經濟、向隴海路交涉免費運潼、茲得該路准許、已將到達潼關、抵潼後、再由長途汽車、運至西安、</p>
<p>設合作社　棉業統制會、以天氣日漸温和、棉將播種、故特派原料處專家徐仲迪至陜、成立棉業改進處、發放棉種、已於前日（七日）啓程、將於本月十三日到達、上項棉籽、可播種棉田八萬餘畝、每畝照平常收穫可採花五十升左右、全年採花約有四十萬擔、旣可補充全國紗廠之需要、且亦减少外棉之輸入、農民收穫後、出售與市、該會恐商人低價操縱、並擬組織農産合作社、使農民售出物時、得有良好價格、</p>
<p>推行各省　該會自陜省棉種改進後、並將推行於各省、山西湖南再省亦已在計劃中、因該二省田土中含有鹹質、故先用灌溉之法、使鹹質逐漸冲去、然後播種棉籽、務使國棉能自給、不需仰求外棉、然短時期中、尚難實行耳、至出發各地之調查專員、因須經過詳細之調查、最近期、内尚難返滬、</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>關於文學學習步</h3>
<p>驟寫作及其他</p>
<p>丨總答汪企倫，陳子元，郭經武，金XX諸君等，</p>
<p>近來我們接到許多詢問關於文學的學習步驟，寫作及其他零碎而又爲一般對文學極具熱忱的初學者所關心的問題的信。發信者不是工人卽是店員而且都很年青；據他們來信所述，其中有二三個曾進過初等中學，但因家庭經濟不繼，便輟學下來了；其餘的情形更壞，祗受過小學敎育。他們迫於貧困，不能獲得應有的敎育機會，便從校門跑出來參加社會的生産，工作的繁忙，雖欲入夜校補習亦爲時間情勢所不許。可是憑着他們自習的努力，從他們的信看來，其文字的通順清麗縱比起一般大學生，也不見得有什麽遜色或更勝過。這使得我們慚愧，足以打破一般對大衆的文化能力之歧視；但同時也使得我們得到我們的工作實有重大的意義的證明：提高大衆的文化水凖，從其羣圍中培育擢拔出眞正是他們自己的作家，這工作不單是可能，而且是必需的。</p>
<p>他們，懷疑他們自己的能力，他們徘徊着，摸索着前進的路經。我們曾經幾次三番的說過能力是可以努力自學而增進的，并不一定要入學校才可培植。同時，我們還舉了許多文學史上有名人物做例證。其實，采例何須遠，卽返觀諸君一己自學的進展，不旣可以勇往直前了麽？每一階段的成就都在等待着你們。</p>
<p>我們不是文學家，我們也在和諸君一樣摸索着前進的路徑。不過，在這進程中也許我們的見聞要比諸君多一點，清楚一點，承詢各節，茲謹略貢其一得之愚，以與諸君商榷。</p>
<p>我們先來討論學習的步驟。汪君提出的計劃分爲三期：第一期「一方面多讀些文學上有價值的作品，一方面多練習作文；「第二期：二到了」第一期「已有相當根底，乃開始研究中國文學」；第三期爲研究西洋文學。郭君所提出的計畫是：求得對於文藝理論有系統的理解爲第一期，對文藝理論求更深的探討，并研究剏作方法與作品爲二期；繼續理論及作品約研究并開始社會科學的研究爲第三期。於此，郭君又附帶的聲明他的原意祗在研究文學，如有可能時始讀社會科學的書。這見解和另外的一位讀者潘君相同，他讀了好些文學的書，很想致力於文學，但現在他又想唸點社會科學的書，惟恐一心旁鶩兩皆無成。</p>
<p>我們覺得汪郭兩君，所提出的學習步驟，無論在原則上或事實的運用上都有許多缺點。第一，兩君特别是汪君完全忽略了社會科學的認識對於文學的鑑賞研究與剏作之必要。我們知道文學是藝術的一部門，而藝術是時代社會的反映并暗示作者對其所處的時代社會的理解和希望以具體的形象表現出來的東西。這樣，我們没有社會科學如經濟學，政治學，社會學，心理學？……等等正確的認識做基礎，而想獲得對文學的鑑賞研究上完全的瞭解簡直是不可能的事。我們要是没有社會科學帮助我們爭取社會的認識，則我們的剏作將流於内容空虚，成爲文學的雜凑與遊戲而已。誠然，在過去，在今日仍多的是文字的雜凑與遊戲無所謂内容的東西流行着，發揮其「帮閒」的任務。但這此都不過是水面的浮沫，將要給時代的洪流衝去無影無踪的。我們忙人，不應跟着那般腐朽的閒人賣空買空地玩弄文學，我們應得把文學這工具做我們的一支喇叭，呌出我們對社會的願望，也喚醒像我們一類的忙人，這樣子去做一個文學家，方不失其意義，方不致於落伍，要這樣，我們要想做文學家的念頭，纔可以說是高貴的因此，修習社會科學是必要的條件，不能說是旁鶩，亦唯有與社會科學相辅而行方可期文學的研究與剏作有相當的建樹。第二，汪君的計劃第一步，一方面多讀文學上有價値的作品，一方面多練習寫作，是無可非難的要比郭君一開首便作文藝理論的探討，爲佳，因爲文學的理論多少涉論一般的作品，不先讀過一點作品，那不會對文藝理論有深切的了解；更何况文藝理論是根據社會科學的方法，郭君却又把社會科學的研究放到最末一期的屁股上。但汪君所謂的第一期，我們覺得是每一期都必需的。作品是不竭的趕到你的面前；文章也不是一個限定的期間，可以達到登峯造極的境地，其實，文章永遠没有達到登峯造極的時候。第三，汪君所謂第二期開始研究中國文學，第三期研究西洋文學，大約是指史的探討而言，不然，祗是作品的翻讀，那簡直是把二三期都趕到第一期的範圍裏去了。但文學史的研究須有深厚的根基，不能掉開一般理論的探討而不顧。汪君的計劃範圍太廣，太空洞了，不易着手，結果仍將陷於亂撞的狀態。這一點則郭君的計劃實勝於汪君，較合實際運用。（未完）</p>

<h3>東吳大學上海同學會昨開年會</h3>
<p>到劉湛恩等三百餘人</p>
<p>組織俱樂部改選職員</p>

<h3>工部局各校議增學費</h3>
<p>工部局財務處長、近向敎育委員會提出一意見書、内稱工部局之學校經費、向係由學童家長及納稅人分别担任、至其担任之比例、在數年前、曾定一原則認爲所收學費、應佔三分之一、至今日局立各中學、大抵保持此項比例、惟如一爲推究、則可見此項辦法、實使一般家長所受利益、遠逾其担負之額、舉例言之、設有外僑某甲、有子女二人在學、每年約共付學費三百十二元、同時由捐稅代渠担任之敎育費、卽爲六百二十四元、設此人每月房租一百四十元、每年付總捐不過二百三十五元二角而巳、又設有華人某乙、有二子在局立之中學、每年付學費約一百五十三元六角、則同時由捐稅代渠支付之敎育費、卽約爲三百另七元二角、如此人每月房租八十元、則每年所付總捐不過一百三十四元而巳、由此觀之、是上经等家長、不僅在敎育費上、須由捐稅補其不足、而其他一切之市政經費、彼等皆實際不担任分文矣、</p>
<p>在他國、敎育費固在抵由公家担任、惟工部局則情形不同、緣工部局旣無强迫敎育之權、而在局立各校就學之兒童、亦僅界内學齡兒童之極小部分、如此、是少數市民、顯係享受特優之利益、爲他人所負担、且大多數之貧寒華籍市民、勢難享受此項敎育之便利、</p>
<p>又局立學校之學費、與非局立學校亦有關係、工部局甚鼓勵各國居民自行辦學、但局校收費過低、則有與他校競爭之影響、鑒於以上各項理由、故財務處長主張、將此問題卽加以考慮、俾局立各校、得一律增收學費云、此議經敎委員會討論之下、認爲極關重要、已將該意見書分别鈔呈各董事審閱、並行公布、以備公衆之考慮、</p>

<h3>擺的種種</h3>
<p>— 沈瘦若</p>
<p>「擺」一個字，細細地推究起來，顯分着「勞工」和「貴族」兩大階級的對立；更可從而體味到同一擺也，其中雖有甘苦勞逸之不同，但其危險性却並不因此而有所歧異的。</p>
<p>爲了要維持苦惱生活而苟延性命於惡劣環境之中，於是不得不擺個攤頭，以博蠅頭微利，勉强養活一身或全家。但是每每要受到意外的嚴厲干涉，使你藉此養家活口的攤頭，不能安定的擺，没有辦法，只得忍着痛苦採取流動方式的擺，像做私事般東擺擺西擺擺。心裏兀似鐘擺樣兒搖蕩不定。</p>
<p>把生命抛在黄浦江裏去胃險的搖擺渡，也無非要挣幾個錢買飯吃來支撑一座五臟廟；但是多麽可怕啊！江面裏如大鯨魚張開巨口般的大輪船往來如織，一個不留神，小魚似的舢板，隨時有被知之虞。非但如此，或許還有不測的禍兆，大風潮忽的起於江心，那你搖擺渡者的命運，就没有把握了！</p>
<p>擺起官冕堂皇似乎神聖不可侵犯的架子，而使一般崇奉架子的人們深深下拜，那時你自己非但覺得旣得意又寫意；就是一般疾惡擺架子的仁兄雖在詛駡你，但在盲從者的神經剌激中，因此愈見你貴族化之偉大了。不過，你須仔細，架子不可擺得太足，恐怕架子不勝重量時或會坍倒的。</p>
<p>檯面擺得越多，塲面越見闊綽。不過，我以爲眞有錢的，不妨大擺而特擺；卽使傾家蕩産，也不失爲救濟社會的一種吧？（因爲開門七件事擺不端正的人，去向他們直接懇予救濟，當然難得允許的。）反之，没有錢而欲擺空塲面的，雖然一時豪舉，也會有人來恭維你一聲公子哥兒，可是你得留心，流氓　三，就是公子哥兒的退伍兵啊！</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十五回　涙臉送人辭家婦遠戍風沙澈夜出塞駐孤城</p>
<p>以前說咱們吃糧不替國家出力，這回咱們總算是替中華民國賣力來了，可是吃的還是窩頭，喝的還是冰塊。自强笑道：咱們當軍官的，總算好，還鬧了一張土坑睡。正說着呢，那隔壁屋子裏，唏唆唏唆作嚮。原來這是一間大些的屋子，滿地鋪了稭　，弟兄們全睡在上面，滾得那東西唏唆作嚮呢。自强道：早十幾天，營長就說，可以領得戰時給養了，有這些個天了，還没請下來嗎？關耀武道：誰知道？現在全國都說咱們是不抵抗軍隊，也許爲了這一點。我XX說不抵抗的X，他們說風凉話，怎麽不到關外去抵抗？只要他到這兒來嘗嘗這滋味。說着，用脚在地上極力一頓。自强笑道：老關，你什麽事發牢騷？他還不曾答覆呢，只聽到嘩啦啦一聲嚮，這屋子裏屋頂下的灰塵，篩糠似的落了下來。關耀武是個老營務，早跳出了屋子去。自强也怕是有什麽意外，立刻將手槍掏出皮套了來，跟着跳到門外。這就聽到有人喊道：風括倒了屋子了。趙自强將精神鎭定了，回想那聲音，倒像是坍了屋子。自己立刻站在弟兄們住的門外，鎭壓着不許噪動。不多大一會兒，嘩啦啦再一陣嚮，又倒了幾間房子了。再聽聽那天空裏的風，或者轟轟嚮過半天，或者呼的一聲，依然不斷的加緊。行軍的時候，越是遇到天變不測，越是要充分警戒，以免意外，營長已經傳了命令下來，加意戒備。王士立走到自强面前，低低的道：連長，你住的那屋子，也吱加吱加嚮首，恐怕要坍了。這個樣子，今天晚上，可得加小心。（三三二）</p>
<h3>三十年前之南京路</h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>南京路，就是現在英租界第一條大馬路，無論那一個到過上海的，都知道繁華熱鬧，兩旁的崇樓大厦，像珠闕迢遙，碧城高聳一般’而中間東西來往的車輛，尤如梭織，晝夜不斷的開行；世界上的都市，上海一埠，原來算不得什麽？然而在中國地方看起來，也好比上中世意大利的市府威尼士，翡冷翠差不多了！因爲起初雖說是不過商業上的結集，而不曉得政治上的組織，漸漸裏生出無數有相關的歷史呢？</p>
<p>三十年前的南京路，最著名的地段，從外灘公園，自東而西，一到抛球塲，已是盡頭了；儻再過此，則蔓草縱横，白楊蕭瑟，游跡稀少，佳客不臨，「虹廟」僅僅一座枯屋，而燒香燃燭的人，舍郤老嫗輩，亦絶少花技招展，携二八雛環，拜倒於諸佛脚下的；「英工部局」設在盆湯衖，而其權也不及今日的大而且嚴，相傳「左宗棠」，當移兵駐浙的當兒，率兵士數千，道經滬上，猶得荷槍實彈，大踏步直過南京路，外人非但不敢稍阻，還要加以敬禮呢！</p>
<p>上海戲園子，名氣最著，而開設最早，要推「三雅園」了，其地址就在今日的先施公司相近，有一天大力士「馬永貞」入該園獻藝，價目，戲資本來只售一角，因此增漲到四角，已稱爲破天荒；後來馬被馬販子擊斃在「一洞天」，其地點在大新街中，光復前萬康醬園左旁，尙有小樓一角，顔其額「一洞天」，就是一些遺蹟；泥城橋北有「洋務局」，每當上海道臺出城到局視事的時候，必經過南京路，乘坐馬車，前導以騎馬的武弁一名，兩旁夾以衞士，後則殿以跟隨二名，各乘馬匹，招搖過市，煞是威風，其名勝有「楊柳樓臺」，係創「游戲報」的第一人，名呌「翔甫」，爲袁子才之孫，署名「楊柳樓臺主」，現在恐没有人能記得了，那跑馬廳裏，還有一座「石牌坊」，是某姓未曾賣與外人的遺物，以前尙有子孫，在清明時節去祭掃，今則，恐已零落無存，那個知道有祖　宗的精靈在上经處呢！「跑馬廳北」，「龍飛馬房」東，有高大的洋房，房的樓上，設一茶肆名「者者樓」，其主人卽粤人「施德之」，「者者」兩字，能得解識其用意的，固是少數，因出自名人「我佛山人」所題，當然不同凡響了；其實就是「仁者見仁，智者見智」的兩句話，說穿了，大家都狠明白哩！</p>
<p>一條南京路，就我一個人的回憶，已像疻盡滄桑，都成夢幻的樣子，其他說；可見得現在的歌臺舞榭，安知將來不作芳草一垢，今宵的蝶醉蜂迷，安知他時不入桐棺三寸呢！</p>
<h3>握手與作揖</h3>
<p>— 李弢安</p>
<p>中西禮節不同的地方很多，譬如歐美的人碰到了：得相互的握一下手表示親熱，但在咱們古國裏可就有點兩樣，就是彼此拱拱手作一個長揖。（雖然目今有些摩登的人們已經改變了。）</p>
<p>其實，這只是一種虚僞的禮貌，本來没有甚麽大不了，不過，有位朋友講：從這種極小的塲合可以看得出各個民族性表現的差異，外國人是富於團結，合羣的居多，所以連大家會見了都　成一片·談到咱們自己，向來誇說甚麽「各人自掃門前雪，莫管他人瓦上霜」的舊訓，所以，彼此碰見了也只不過遠遠離開的拱拱手作個揖而已矣。</p>
<p>但我，却認爲這句話語只是一種幽默的趣談，如果是眞的，那豈但打訕咱們自家人，而且是太寃枉了咱們自家人。</p>

<h3>最經濟的眞空管試騐器</h3>
<p>— 郭永年</p>
<p>眞空管試騐器是試騐各種眞空管能否在常態下工作的儀器、現成的出品，在國内恐不能買到；卽使有，價格一定高昻非凡，也非一般人所能購備，本文所介紹的是最簡單最經濟的一種，小規模的無線電研究會等團體或業餘家個人都應照做一個，以備製造或修理收音機時，對於眞空管的好壞先有個肯定的判别。　　圖中零件說明如下：</p>
<p>燈絲變壓器：用在llov交流電上，鐵心用闊一吋疊至一吋厚之山字形矽鋼片，初級用廿八號漆包線繞六百六十圈，次級用十六號漆包線共繞四十五圈，在第九，十五，十八，三十，及四十五圈處各山一頭，這樣計有r.5V·2·5V·3V·5V，7.5V五種不同之燈絲電壓，引出之線頭接在分線釘上，分線釘鄰兩個須遠遠離開，或兩個中間多裝一個無接線之分線釘，以免在改變電壓時使分線開關有同時接觸兩個接線釘的機會，不然，次級線圈是容易燒斷的，每個接頭應註明所有之電壓，以防錯誤。　　A是千分安培表，買O丨roM·A·的已够用。</p>
<p>Rl是A的分路電阻，關上SW·r，可以曉得比A指示大三倍的電流通過。電阻量用900個歐姆。</p>
<p>R2是五十歐姆的中心分綫電阻。</p>
<p>R3是發生一個半伏脫C電壓的電阻，用五百個歐姆。</p>
<p>R4有三千五百個歐姆，連同R3可發生四弗打之C電壓其餘兩個一是X式四脚燈座一是Y式五脚燈座。</p>
<p>第一次應用時，要把各種已知可作爲標凖的眞空管插在這試騐器上，接上電源，調整好燈絲電壓，先關上SW2後放開牠，就可在表上讀出最大和最小兩個數。每種眞空管都這樣試過，可以造成一個表格，以後都依這個表上的數字作判别的根據。</p>
<p>最高記錄668810941058</p>
<p>最低記錄2122221212</p>
<p>眞空管-10-27-26-71-12-45-99-80-24-22</p>
<p>附表是幾種普通的眞空管，讀者可作爲參考。71和80號須把SW·I關上，以免有過大之電流通過A，凡屏流大的眞空管都應如此·24等四極管，須另加燈腰座各一個，裝成附圖二的接續器。應用時把接續器的燈腰插在試騐器燈座上，眞空管插在接續器燈座上，鋼片夾在眞空管管頂上的G極，就可照樣試騐。</p>
<h3>談談收音機用的電池</h3>
<p>— 明襄</p>
<p>直流收音機，電源的供給，幾全賴電池：電池用盡後，不能復原的，稱爲原電池（PrimaryCell）可充以外源電力，使其恢復作用的，稱爲次電池（SecondaryCell）或蓄電池（StosageCell）;原電池除通用的乾電池外，復有新出的空氣電池（SirCeli）；蓄電池亦有鉛板與愛迪生兩種，現在分别扼要的說明於下：</p>
<p>乾電池　乾電池並非眞係乾的，其構造：中間以炭棒爲正極，外以圓鋅筒作負極，兩極間隔以二養化錳等混合物的防衰劑，及吸水紙隔離物，均浸潤於綠化鋅和碯砂的溶液中，以起化學作用；每瓶的電壓爲一·五伏脫，如用以供給收音機燃燈絲的A電，可串聯數個，再以耗阻器調節之，使與眞空管的絲極電壓適符，惟其容量有限，又不能復原，故收音機燈絲總電流在半安培以上的，最好用後述的蓄電池，較爲經濟；集合多數小乾電池，亦可作爲供給眞空管屏電力的B電。</p>
<p>空氣電池　此種電池因其防衰劑直接取自四週空氣中的養氣，故以此得名，每瓶電壓始用時約二·五伏脫，容量極大，爲六百安培小時，用以供給二伏脫眞空管（如230，232，233等）之燈絲，最爲適宜；惟其放電率，不能超過○·七五安培，且價格較貴，我國市上，尙不多見。</p>
<p>鉛板蓄電池　以鉛質二極板，浸於比重一·二八○的稀硫酸溶液中，再以外源直電流充入，自陽極鉛板入，陰板出，使陽板的活動質（卽起化學作用的物質），成爲棕色的養化鉛，陰板成爲青灰色的絨狀鉛，充足的電瓶，約有二·二伏脫的電壓，供給收音機A電的蓄電池，都串聯三瓶成一池，電壓爲六伏脫，容量約自六十安培時至二百安培時；如串聯多數容量極小的鉛板蓄電池，作爲收音機的B電，亦極相宜，因用盡後，可藉外電力使之復活，故取之不竭，經濟特甚，惟管理携帶，較爲麻煩。</p>
<p>愛迪生電池　係愛迪生氏所發明，其構造大致與鉛板電池相似，惟所有盛器，極板等，均係鋼質鑄成，陽板的活動質爲輕養鎳，陰板爲養化鐵，電液係輕養化鉀之稀溶液，電池充足時，每瓶電壓約一·二伏脫，其特殊優點，卽堅固耐用，雖或短路，擱置，震動，均不致减損其壽命，且重量輕，維持費亦省，但因價格極貴，不甚普及。</p>
<h3>以33檢波的一隻强力單管機</h3>
<p>— 王輔民</p>
<p>在平常收音機中司檢波的，大都皆用三極管或者四極管，但是，現在我們也可以使用低放的强力五極管（PowerPentode）來檢波，你想奇不奇？用牠來做一隻一燈機，的確能超過一切，關於這種綫路，在其他無綫電刋物上也有登載過的。現在所介紹的綫路，同别的也差不多，但是，在L4的傍邊多添了一隻活動蓄電器及綫圈L3，這樣能增加收音機的選擇性，今將所須另件列表於下：　　L丨用三○直徑膠木筒繞二十六號雙沙包綫五十圈須能變改牠的自感量。</p>
<p>L1L2L3L4I三○徑膠管用二十六號雙紗包红先繞L1十○後繞L2五十五○再繞L4四十五○三個綫○皆隔開八分二○。</p>
<p>L3丨丨以同號綫繞在L4的外面五十○二○間須隔以絶緣物。</p>

<h3>關於電容器</h3>
<p>— 孟澂</p>
<p>電容器是電學儀器中最緊要的一件，更是無綫電路中最不可少的部份，收音機裏，不論是放大器，檢波器，整流器，振盪器，以及晶體收音電路等，都必須接入電容器，方有功效。</p>
<p>二片導體，中間有絶緣體隔開，不相連接時，就成就了一個電容器，因爲此時若於二片間接上電壓，極短時間以後，二片之上，卽储有相當的電量了。二根導綫，在空氣中，相距若干厘米，也就成一個電容器，因爲空氣是絶緣體，接以電壓，導綫上就儲有電量，不過此時所儲的電量，極爲微少，一般不甚注意罷了。導體中間的絶緣體，專稱做介電體，空氣，蠟紙，雲母和油類等等，都是很好而常用的介電體。</p>
<p>電容器對於交流電的阻力，與交流週率的高低，適成反比。直流了可說是交流的特種情形，其週率爲零，所以電容器對於直流的阻力爲無窮大，換句話說，就是直流不能通過電容器，電容器可以將交流與直流分開。因爲阻力與週率反比，電容器還可以將高週率的交流，與低週率的交流分開，旁路電容器與濾波電容器的功用，無非根據上面的原理。</p>
<p>電容器的種類，依構造上說，有定量與變量兩種，定量電容器多用雲片或油紙爲介電體，變量電容器多以空氣爲介電體。再依在收音機裏功用上的不同，定量的又有栅路電容器，枝路電容器，和濾波電容器等等。栅路電容器供栅極上電子暫時儲存之用，電容量極小，枝路電容器供高週率電綫電流便利流通之用，電容量較大，而濾波電容器則爲低率電流短路之用，電容量更大。變量電容器大半用於配諧電路，但也有用以控制振盪的，電容量恒極小，約在數十至數百兆兆分法拉特之間，又有將幾個同樣的變量電容器，合裝一軸，爲配諧便利計的，稱做同軸電容器。</p>
<h3>關於擴聲器</h3>
<p>— 朱紫源</p>
<p>擴聲器（LoudSpeaker）俗名剌叭，又呌揚聲器，就是經過音頻電流後，能發出足供多人聽聞的聲音的器具。牠的種類和構造不一，這裏對於旽普通的幾種來約略說說。</p>
<p>第一種是鋼膜式擴聲器，這一式原理和構造完全與聽筒相似，不過對於一切材料加大，使電磁力加强，薄膜振動得利害，故聲音大，上面再將上喇叭便成，如圖一，M爲骊蹄形永久磁石，綫圈Cr與C2用細銅綫繞於兩磁極S及N上成串聯，薄膜則置於磁極之上，其間跟離極小，當低週率電流經過此兩綫圈時，則視電流之强弱，而生强度不同之磁力，因之影響於永久磁石磁力之變化，而使磁石上之薄膜上下振動，其振幅及速度，均視磁力强弱而異，而附近之空氣，因受其激盪而成聲矣。</p>
<p>此式擴聲器其薄膜與磁極間之距離，極難適合，稍近，卽於音强時，薄膜易與磁極相觸而成雜聲，稍遠，則於低微之音，不能聽聞，且對於不同之週率，其效力亦各不同，每有其諧振週率，於某一週類放聲特高之弊，故現今用者頗少。</p>
<p>此項擴聲器使用時，應注意以下幾點：</p>
<p>（一）不可用劇列之振擊。</p>
<p>（二）接綫脚正負不可接反（花色者接B正）</p>
<p>（三）喇叭内不可有灰塵等侵入。</p>
<p>（四）防止受潮。</p>
<p>（五）磁極與薄膜之距離須校正。</p>
<p>第二種就是所謂一種平衡平衡簧古式擴聲吕，牠是由鋼膜式擴聲器進化而來的，靈敏度限高，同時對於强音不會和磁極接觸，構造大略如下。</p>
<p>A是用軟鐵做的黄舌，在外面用細銅綫繞數千圈，然後放在磁D中鐵間，當低週率電流能過綫圈時，簧舌卽具磁性，與永久磁石之磁力，依同性相斥異性相吸之理，交互吸斥，簧舌卽依圖中（圖二）M爲中心，左右振動不已，由桿B將此振動達之薄膜C激動空氣而成聲矣。</p>
<p>使用此種振聲器時，其簧舌地位，須在兩極正中，使其振動自由，餘與上同。</p>
<p>以上兩種都是屬於電磁式擴聲器的，還有一種呌電動式擴聲器（DynamicSpeaker）現在在交流收音機上，非常盛行，其大略構造如下：</p>
<h3>源電流直接　器压出輸接</h3>
<p>A是熟鐵，B是動磁圈，D是音圈（或稱活動綫圈）連於薄膜，勵圈用直流電供給（在交流收音機中，住往就利用牠作濾波桅制綫圈）音圈則與輸出發壓器相接，當直流電通週勵磁圈時，熟鐵即變爲電磁石，同時音圈内有低週率電流通過後，亦成一磁塲，因兩磁塲之相互作用，音圈卽被振動，其振動强弱視音流及勵磁流而異，勵磁流普通自數十千分盎配至數盎配，當然如勵磁流較大，可得較優之成績，然亦須估量勵磁圈能否承受較大電流也，否則必致發熱而燒斷矣。音圈被振動後，因其連於薄膜C，故薄膜亦被振動，因此激盪空氣而成聲矣。</p>
<p>使用此種擴聲器，如勵磁圈直流電壓不足，則聲音必致微弱，若遇無聲，除喇叭綫中斷，或接頭鬆脫外，勵磁圈之斷綫，亦須注意及之。</p>

<h3>論笑之可惡</h3>
<p>— 林語堂</p>
<p>這是在咖啡館中之一夜。原因是雅西新從法國回來，那天晚飯，聽他的叔叔祥甫說到霞飛路咖啡館之清雅有趣，滿口稱道，自雅西聽來，似乎在說巴黎的咖啡館不好，有點不服，負氣約了他的老同學于君連他的叔叔三人同來的。在祥甫口中，雅西之讀音，有點特别，由老于聽來似乎就是亞賽，而賽字又似讀平聲。他在法國留學之時，曾經把他拚寫爲AsenAsayAsaillesAsaient四種，尤其最後兩種，是他最得意的，但是自從一位法國女郎呼他爲Assez以後他的同學也就呼他爲Sssez，也有的轉譯爲中語，呼他爲「够了」。再有人轉爲文言，呼他爲「休矣」。也有留英的學生來遊巴黎，呼他爲Isay。但是祥甫因爲自小呼慣了，還是呼他爲阿賽，而賽字讀平聲，雅西也莫奈之何，只說他近來回國了，小名實在不大好聽，雅西是他的號，然而他的叔叔却仍然認爲並無以號呼他姪兒之必要。</p>
<p>他們三人坐在我的靠近一桌上。雅西看見桌上有璃玻面，認爲他出洋以後幾年中，上海的確進步了，但是他輕易不肯稱譽國貨。</p>
<p>「你看那女子燙的頭髮，學什麽巴黎，不東不西，實在太幽默了。」</p>
<p>「你也懂得幽默這新名詞嗎？」老于說。</p>
<p>「怎麽不懂！在巴黎我也看過幾本論語……什麽東西！中國人那里懂得幽默！」</p>
<p>祥甫本來也是道學。他一向也反對幽默。但是他反對的不是滑稽，是反對幽默這西洋名詞，尤其反對「論語」兩字，被現代人拿來當做刋物名稱。他說滑稽荒唐是无妨的，文人偶爾做點游戲文字當做消遣，是无妨的。滑稽又要說正經話，又莊又諧，他是反對的。他說比方一人要嫖就得到外頭去嫖，跟自己太太還好親吻非禮嗎？你想家里太太也拉胡琴，唱京調，燙頭髮，打扮的花技招展，成個什麽體統呢。他在家中非常嚴肅正經，浪漫時家中小子是看不見的。所以他向來看論語，在家中也是扳起臉孔看的，越看越怒，雖然越怒越看。論語一向就是被這派義憤塡胸「怒看」的人買完了；老于之輩常是買不到的，或是買得到，也被家里老太爺拿去没收。但是此刻因爲雅西反對，他反而要替國貨說兩句好話了，因爲雅西雖然留過學，在他仍然是亞賽而已，而賽字是讀平聲。</p>
<p>「論語怎麽不好？」祥甫說。</p>
<p>這時祥甫老伯是贊成幽默，而雅西反而成道學；這種營壘有點特别。</p>
<p>「像拉微巴黎仙才是幽默，才讓你笑得不可開交」丨這時我正在看一本拉微巴黎仙上的圖，一雙女人大腿放在面團團富賈的便便大腹上丨丨「那是那樣微妙的，輕鬆的臘丁民族的笑。就如這咖啡館，呌你坐上不快活。我在巴黎時，在咖啡館，一坐就可以坐半天。也不知怎麽，呌你覺得在臘丁鬍子之下露齒一笑是應該的。我們中國人鬍子就留得不好。中國人的笑也是可惡的。」</p>
<p>祥甫是有鬍子的，聽到此話，猛然撇他一眼。老于看見情形不妙，趕緊用話撇開。</p>
<p>「雅西，巴黎我是没有過的，霞飛路上法國鬍子，我也看過不少，這也不可概乎言之。我倒不覺得怎樣。笑一笑，也不見得西洋便怎樣高明，中國便怎樣可惡。論語二十八期也譯過一篇不知誰做的「學究與賊」法國幽默，看來還不同笑林廣記一樣。你們一塌括子道學而已。」</p>
<p>「你記錯了。那是三十期論語上登過的，不是二十八期吧」？剛從法國留學回來之雅西說。「我是由歐回來在法國郵船公司博德士船上讀到的」。</p>
<p>「你們都不是，「學究與賊」是二十六期，十月一日出版的。那日我正有事到無錫去，在車上買到的，明明是十月一日，我還能記錯嗎？」</p>
<p>我飮了一大杯咖啡而去。心裏想着二十八？二十六？三十？實在記不清，况且二十六期是否十月一日出版，也不甚了了。回到家中，找存書，遍翻不得，二十七至三十期皆有，都不見有那篇「學究與賊」。徧徧二十六碼頭缺了。打電話問時代公司，請卽刻派人送一本二十六期來。時代的人慌忙，以爲二十六期出了什麽禍。我說「没有什麽，我神經錯亂而已，反對的人都把期目記清了，我反已記不得。但願天下人都反對幽默。」</p>
<p>「什麽！？」是電話上驚皇的來聲。</p>
<p>「卽刻把二十六期差人寄來」，我戞然把電話掛上。</p>
<h3>願聞徐何創作問題的解說</h3>
<p>— 梁辛</p>
<p>現在的「文壇」上總不斷的出點兒新鮮事，可是多半不是好事情。「文抄」「文剪」的案件，早已過去了，新年却來了何家槐先生的創作的問題。這問題在别的報紙上好像已經鬧得頗長久了，本刋上還只有兩回。但一看侍桁先生的文章，就明白這問題是没有「文剪」之類的簡單的。</p>
<p>這問題的關係範圍比較的大。地域是南京後湖，上海，物主徐轉蓬先生的家鄉（我不知道是那里）；人物是兩位主角之外，有侍桁，「清道夫」，儲安平，高植，沈從文，施蟄存，邵洵美，杜衡，邨人諸位先生，實在爲先前的一切案件所未有的熱鬧。證據有物主的談話，信件，何徐兩位文體的不同，還有將來可以製版印出的原稿，也够到透頂了。</p>
<p>讀者本來已經可以下一句斷語。「法律問題」是不會成的，登在報上，不過是告訴給讀者吧了。然而侍桁先生的文章，却又於揭發之外，種下了一個疑團。他說：「不過轉蓬却另有一番解說，叙述原委，因未經轉蓬許可，現在不便披露。」</p>
<p>將别人的文章，攘爲已有的，我們訖今所知道的有兩種。一是抄了别人的作品，向報章上去投稿，我們常見作者或讀者，接着揭發了出來。一是用廉價買進别人的譯作，改用自己的姓名，得高價賣了出去，我們也往往聽到些傳說。但這回却是作者被竊去了文章，而又自有解說，侍桁先生爲了責任，挺身而出了，於解說却又「不便披露」，使我們只知道一部分的「醜事」。這是什麽緣故呢？</p>
<p>揭發醜事要揭發到底，我張想知道那解說，但自然，也不過完全爲了好奇心，並且加添些對於文苑的智識。</p>
<h3>在馬達山</h3>
<p>— 黑嬰</p>
<p>在崎嶇的，彎曲的山路上爬着，汽車疲乏了似的吼了起來。日子是明朗的，來的時候我們都覺得熱，可是停在半山的泉水旁邊，跳下車來，風是清凉得多了。</p>
<p>（奇蹟呵！在赤道上的蘇門答拉島上却有那麽凉快的一座馬達山。長年是秋天；我來過兩次的，我知道現在應該把薄絨線衫穿起來了。）</p>
<p>站在山腰上眺望着遼遠的地面，家屋和椰子林凑合成一張風景油畫似的。再望過去，碧藍的海連着天。便鬆了口氣，悄悄地在心裏讚歎着：</p>
<p>丨美麗的南島呵！</p>
<p>X　X　X　X</p>
<p>帶着亞珍，用輕快的步子在平滑的路上走着；這小妮子用一對好奇的眼睛望着馬達人，望着馬達人住的屋子。走過一條小溪，許多小孩光着身子在游水；這裏的天氣是秋天的，可是他們還能够跳到溪水裏去！</p>
<p>風景是差不多跟别的地方一樣，椰子樹到處都有。然而這裏有着深綠的原野，永遠喷着氣的琉璜山。這裏是馬達民族的老家，他們的風味跟馬來人是兩樣的。</p>
<p>這天離我們住的地方不遠正演着馬達人的戲，亞珍吵着要看，可是我厭惡那些東西。現在我們走到郊外來了，一陣風帶着一陣野花的悒鬱味吹到我的臉上，我便醉了似地緊緊倚着她在草地上坐了一個下午。</p>
<p>X　X　X　X</p>
<p>晚上，馬達山是沉靜的。</p>
<p>我感到寂寞。亞珍給她的母親帶到房子裏睡覺去了，留下我，獨自個兒坐着，坐着，夜是靜的。</p>
<p>X　X　X　X</p>
<p>趁陽陽光還未照臨的清早，我起了床。没有洗過臉就站在窗子前出望着一重迷濛的朝霧。琉璜山全給霧遮住了，在我的眼前是一片灰色迷茫……</p>
<p>陽光穿過灰霧照到床上，我把領帶打好了。</p>
<p>丨GoodMarning</p>
<p>小鳥似的，跳到衣架子那裏給我帶了件外衣走近來，我喜歡亞珍的天眞的笑臉。</p>
<p>（給她一個吻嗎？那麽可愛的少女呵	！）</p>
<p>可是我没有伸過嘴去；就跟她一同下樓吃早餐去了。</p>
<p>回到家裏老唸着馬達山；現在也忘不了馬達山。眞是奇蹟呵，赤道上的蘇門答拉島上却有那麽凉快的一座馬達山。……</p>
<h3>南歸雜記（續）</h3>
<p>— 唐弢</p>
<p>（二）傷往</p>
<p>到了家，吃過點心。母親首先告訴我一些細瑣的家事。這幾年甚麽都不像樣，田裏每年要蝕上幾百元；帮工的薪金倒要抵一個小店舖裏的先生，但還是好吃懶做，夜裏賭到三更多，白天就躺在牀上裝肚子痛。</p>
<p>自從父親死後，村子裏大家都冷淡起來，朋友不必說，連親戚也一個個溜了開去。女人家主持家政，到處受氣，誰肯說句公道話。</p>
<p>這些這些，在母親的臉上加了深深的痕路。使她早晨有了沉重的咳嗽，晚間作著興廢炎凉的夢囈。</p>
<p>母親問了我些路上的事。甥兒們圍著我討連環圖畫册。我只默默地想着，想著這家是有了一種發霉似的衰敗的氣味，門庭是那麽冷落，我幾乎在每一個角子裏找得出鼬鼠的足跡來；梁上掛著燕子的空巢；瓦檐縫裏麻雀做著窠；天花板和柱子上時時有灰白的石灰和蛀蝕的木片落下來。家，這一點也不像我們幾年前的家。</p>
<p>幾年前，我們家裏總不斷人。雖說骨子裏也鬧窮，但我們幾個孩子却够快活，跳，笑，打架，才紤人還厭我們太會鬧，不成樣子。天知道，現在可成了這個樣子！</p>
<p>我跑上樓，寂寞也跟着我到樓上。打開書箱，我要尋找我的童年，我的不成樣子的跳，笑，打架。這兒一疊一疊的，有的是我小學時代的抄本，默書簿，作文簿，白的紙，黑的字兒，蚯蚓似的筆劃；我望見那每一篇完後用紅墨水題着的羅馬字，一百分，九十分；我記起那從敎師手裏接過簿子來時候的快樂。我記起那沿岸種着莙蓮菜的河塘，每天每天，我和二個姊姊背着書包從那兒上學堂去。我記起那關公像，從繡像小說裏放大下來，塗上顔色，去貼在大門上，我甚麽都記得，可是甚麽也不容許我再去回想，大姊墳上的樹幹已經長得比人高大，二姊的孩子也會看連環圖畫册，也會畫了關公去貼在大門上。</p>
<p>我，我自己也就成了這個冷落門庭的支撑者。</p>
<p>母親說舟車勞頓，勸我睡一會。躺在故居的床上，我做起往昔繁榮的夢來。</p>

<p>揚帆，藴剛，白燕，孤雲，江敉，諸先生：請示最近通訊處！</p>
<h3>暮</h3>
<p>— 靳以</p>
<p>度着無盡的幽寂寂長漫漫的日子，青枝和青松的年歲都在三十上　轉了灣。</p>
<p>雖然這並不算是到了使人只有感嘆的老年；可是她們的心呢，一年一年地向衰老之境沉去。再襯上了鬱暗的，不施脂粉的，黄黄的臉：那上面有乾枯的嘴唇，和圍在黑暈之中的無神的眼睛；她們也很久不穿亮色的衣服，都有着瘦弱的身軀，用了遲緩的脚步走路……像這些，都能使人在初見之後，知道了纔是三十一歲的年紀，發着輕微的喟嘆：「呵，纔是三十一歲的人呵」！</p>
<p>她們也都是靜默的就是只有兩個人的時候，也不大多說話；在人前，幾乎是像與世無染的修道者。到了眞是大想說出來些什麽的時候，也只是讓嘴唇微微地動兩下而已。她們是把所有的事件，都刻在自己的心上。</p>
<p>說是姊妹地稱呼着，她們是雙生女，姊姊的青枝，比着妹妹青松了濺早來到這世上半個整天。在面容上，行止上，個性上：她們都有很大的相像。可是在遭遇上，青松是家了纔三個月就成爲了寡婦；而青枝呢，是仍然没有出嫁的老處女。</p>
<p>青松的出嫁，是在她十九歲的那一年：那丈夫，是一個三期的肺病患者。本來是還不至於那樣早就嫁了的，因爲這古老民族傳說上的一點眞理，說是能有一點用的，就把青松從少女成爲婦人，這期間也只有短短的三月，她又在爲没有丈夫的寡婦了。</p>
<p>在丈夫的家中，在她自己的家中：未亡人無論如何是要一個人消度迢迢的未亡歲月。所以在丈夫的家裏，守了一年的孝，就由她有錢的父親，接回自己的母家來了。</p>
<p>呵，這一年，成日成夜伴了她的只有眼涙和影子，不是說因爲是哀悼着死去的人而如此，她是想到了縱是尙有青春的少女，從此也只能孤寂寂地活到死的那麽一天，所以，美好的事物也只是空洞的，能引起青年人趣味的，也只惹着她更縐緊了眉頭。母親和姊姊，常是來看望她，那時還在讀書的青柏，也在休假日來伴她，可是這反引起她大的傷心，就是不過分傷感地伏在母親的　上或是和姊姊抱着痛哭，也要更多地流　涙。有着骨内情的人，也就再難忍下心中的酸楚。</p>

<h3>紐約股市新買增加</h3>

<h3>紗花標紗散户傾向抛空</h3>
<p>紗市趨疲、形勢又現軟化之狀、因實需仍無大量起色之望、各路商業依然凋敝、故一般散户心思傾向抛空、惟外棉堅硬而漲、某廠商吸進之額、仍不放出、總之環境惡劣、底盤雖枯、仍難引起買風、</p>
<h3>標紗又軟化</h3>
<p>標紗前市開盤、以美棉上升、塲中賣風未熾、市况尙好、拍至二三盤、市價趨跌、結果人標本月漲三角、遠月跌三·四·六角、午後以棉花平疲、紗市又跌、各月跌二·五·七·八角、全日成交統計一萬三千八百包、查賣出大孚三百五十包、同孚三百包、大豐四百五十五包、同和四百五十包、明德四百五十包、恒昌四百包、買進大昶一千包、同孚五百五十包、惠康九百包、森康三百包、元德三百五十包、一日間最高低及收盤價如下、　　最高價　最低價　收盤價　漲　跌　存賬數</p>

<h3>標花仍在賣户壓迫下</h3>
<p>棉市仍疲、且形勢愈弱、以各棧存棉較厚、紗市疲憊、現棉生意仍汪胆故賣户壓迫尤重、惟美棉轉漲、而本埠人心未能激動、以印棉較軟、且預料美棉明日有回跌消息、於此市價反趨下落埃、</p>
<h3>標花跌兩角</h3>
<p>標花前市開盤、市象尙好、拍至二三盤塲中買氣未濃、收盤又跌、各月跌一角、午後市氣更疲、各月跌一角半至二角半、全日成交統計四萬八千擔、查賣出同孚一千九百擔、裕大一千八百擔、瑞大一千八在是擔、長餘一千二百擔、泰昌一千一百擔、愼記二千七百擔、買進大豐二千擔、遠大一千三百擔、益豐二千六百擔、吉豐一千八百擔、大孚一千四百擔、源大一千五百擔、仁豐一千二百擔、德記一千擔、一日間最高價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>原棉廠需絶無</h3>

<h3>美印棉一致回漲</h3>
<p>昨日美棉市况、參差不定、始因布疋市况不佳而疲、後以華爾街有力回漲、結果現貨漲十五磅音、期貨漲十五磅音至二十四磅音、利物浦棉現貨跌四點、期貨跌三四點、埃及棉現貨跌六點、孟買棉市、始因空頭抵補及投機家買進而漲、後以多頭獲利了結回疲、結果平加爾漲二羅比半、奥姆辣白羅溪均漲一羅比、原電錄左、（八日電）</p>

<h3>津西河花略露生機</h3>
<p>津訊、西河花市况、久經停滯後、現始透露生機、上午雖曾接洽、未獲成妥、下午經洋商買進二百六十九包、開價四十一元三角、其他未有交易、東河長絨棉洋商進意較佳、好貨亦有做出、東棉行買凈貨一百包、開價四十五元五角、瑞源行買進一百二十三包、開價四十一元六角、</p>
<h3>糧食　標粉午後補空回堅</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份大致復呈平疲之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥回好一角左右、坎拿大好四分不等、故開價後、市氣大致疲弱、因政府麥大批出售、公私方面、均巳證實、傳福阜兩家共計十七船、尙餘七船、則係本埠小廠及長江各廠、分别購定、至價廉至三元八角、聞因前徴之麥稅關係、故此番特别通融、以補損失、惟市面正在不景氣、各廠一時擯守、所以人心雖虚、跌度尙不甚大、祇七月份到過二元零二五厘、接近二元大關、餘則祇近分之跌主、迨到十午開盤、因市塲浮空、紛紛暢補、大廠均一致擯住、祇小廠略出、所以價反回定、照目下情形、或須暫時穩住、惟從各種物價低落而言、恐前途甚少良好之望也、結果本月份較前日好二厘半、四月份好五厘、五月份好一分、六月份好二厘半、七月份不動、八月份好五厘云、</p>
<h3>期麥清淡現麥步俏</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份大致呈　定之像、以洋麥報價芝加哥好一角零、坎拿大好四分、開價後、人心仍然平定、因大批政府麥雖已成交、惟交易所市塲、事前聞有接洽、相約不出、故趨勢雖不甚佳、抛户則亦稀少也、各盤交易、清淡如昔、當爲此故、收盤結果、祗七月份較小一分、餘無出入、現麥市面、因到存不豐廠家因洋麥居多、須國麥配用、價遂步覺俏利、開南宿麥三元五角三分、山東麥二元五角一分、蚌埠麥三元四角四分、計二千五百包、由福新華豐辦去云、</p>
<h3>蘇常白粳回好五分</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源三十餘號、（四千五六百石）、另躉銷冐初市猶見平常、及後天時驟轉陰霾、客家心意帶緊、形勢向上、本街店胃栗落、數約三千餘石、常帮南港蘇同帮等粳行情回起五分、至於客帮包胃、祇北洋·天津·烟臺等帮動動、因此採納亦有二千餘包、惟晚稻雖經售方趁機喊高、究以客家吃盤殊難放鬆、致青角松泗西練等晚稻價略提一二分者、仍祇帶緊之局、杜洋尖雖受客尖影響、幸人心稍堅、賴以定局、陰變元相隨無甚上落、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各帮到船拾三四號、市上各貨銷路、稍形起色、白粳高貨平定、中次加緊五六號、羊杜尖挺立、埠客尖早薄稻陰變元堅定、</p>
<h3>客秈本銷活潑</h3>
<p>昨日客秈市况、本客辦胃轉活、雖到頭續有行販求出、而市面已非前日之不振、在晨間開市後、初居平勢、繼以本街暢辦、市卽站佳、後有福州汕頭温州等各帮應酬、市面立卽回挺、高身各貨因此提好二三分、中次仍平、全日開出四千四百六十七包、計由温州去機油一百包、汕頭去白靖二百九十七包、福州去八百五十餘包、共餘盡爲本街辦去、本街後胃尙濃故市面暫時可以站立云、</p>
<h3>黄豆去路步見减縮</h3>
<p>昨黄豆去路落淡、市態疲跌、總之貨厚銷懈勢難發展、廠家雖動、因油餅售價不振、豆胃亦减、昨辦去臨准關豆一車、價二元三角半、懷遠豆一車價爲二元四角、本街零星走化約共四車、計正陽關豆二車、價爲二元六角八至六角半、頴州豆一車、價爲二元五角七至五角六、亳州豆一車、價爲二元五角二、</p>
<h3>糖市　潮青糖市勢轉定</h3>
<p>昨糖市以實銷依然未臻暢達、公會人心仍持觀望、劃盤如二四粗砂白十九元七角、成交祗有數十包嗬赤太B勿動、海南赤砂連烟台帮稍有動動、共開出五六百包、價爲十三元三角十三元四角十三元五角、因積底豐富、市象平定、潮青昨日由怡好公司之和生輪運到一批、計三千三百五十七包、日來銷路稍怠、厥狀轉定、</p>
<h3>南北貨　黑胡椒地價報漲</h3>
<p>胡椒到貨不多、而申市去化平淡、現如一號　四十五元五角、黑大椒四十五元、惟地價反漲、划申須在四十七元、形成倒懸云、</p>
<p>茴香雖以到存兩稀、無如走銷另昨專電市面難振、現市如南寗貨開過二十四元七角、行盤售二十五元、北海貨祇售二十三元五角、市象平定、</p>
<h3>油市白桐油漢市後轉機</h3>
<p>白桐油漢口洋莊連日交易甚稀、故迭見鬆跌、自開盤二十四元五角後、卽跌二十四元、而二十三元七角、而二十三元三四角、迨至　日市上卽有二十三元之傳聞、揆其情形、洋行無大宗採辦、每開一盤、僅數十噸生意、而來源絡繹不絶、市面之疲、亦當然之勢、不料前晚忽又盛傳、漢市洋莊已漲至二十四元、據係曾得漢電者所報告、事果非虚、漢洋行必有大票購進、蓋洋行屢次辦貨、外間無從捉摸、故遇有多數進貨、每多突如其來、而市情之轉變、亦頗早晚不同、斯實對外貿易之不易應付、卽老於此中者、亦多失機、惟漢洋行在川湘各産地、均有設莊收辦、故漢市名雖重心、然已不能提綱挈領、由來已漸、市面之漲跌、旣操縱於洋行之手、若價格漲至二十五元·以上、各洋行卽棉率停辦、市面亦不期然漸趨低　　此内銷之所以失其左右市面能力　　非一日矣、故洋銷價格卽能漲至二十五元以上、總難持久、而巳數見不鮮、今茲之漲、苟能再接再厲、恐亦祗至二十五元、巳達極點、蓋洋行停辦相持之慣技、必又欲施之而予漲風之行擊也、本市號家雖依據漢市、然進貨則以浙桐爲主體、近日漢市雖兎起鶻落、而浙桐尙不隨聲附和、大概因春銷未旺、所以買賣均甚鎭靜耳、</p>
<h3>五金　英白鐵售價步鬆</h3>
<p>英白鐵近來交易不見若何進展、蓋東洋貨充滿於市、因此行清大受影響、現市三尺七尺每張估一元二角、比前又小去五分、三尺六尺一元、亦比前回落三四分、厚白鐵則二十四號售十二元二角、二十六號十三元一角、二十八號十三元八角、俱較前爲上一二角不一、但交易前途依然無大進展、是以業中人頗爲悲觀也云、</p>
<h3>十八張烟皮鐵軋缺</h3>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>讀「一封給大學生的公開信」後</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>潘光旦先生在最近一期「華年」上，發表了一篇「一封給大學生公開信」。潘先生這封信是要寫給大學生讀的，我現時雖然不是在學的大學生，却很高興看，而且看了之後，又想說幾句話，這當是我應有的權利吧？潘先生公開信封信的用意，無疑是非常誠懇的。他看到現下一般大學生，一面因受腐敗大學敎育的躭誤，一面又常被政治活動者所利用，致斵喪了一切，故特提出兩個辦法，獻給他們，期能有所補救於大學生的前程，我們應如何向他感謝呵！</p>
<p>潘先生所要公開討論的二點是什麽呢？（一）工具的學問。（二）對於時避的超然的興趣。關於第一點，潘先生主張：「無論你的興趣是在實科方面，或文科方面，我以爲你至少應該把中文英文弄一個清通。中文不但要閱讀得快，更要能寫作得流利。英文至少要能不翻辭典，也能明白一篇文字的精要」這幾句話我們初看去，彷彿潘先生太看小了大學生了，爲什麽一個大學生還要去做這種工夫呢？其實他却並没有說錯。在今日中國大學敎育之下，不要說是高深學問求不到，卽中英文能閱寫自如的，恐怕還不是多數吧？這說來未免令人傷心，然而事實是這樣，又豈容我們隱諱嗎？故我以爲潘先生所指示，眞是一個最剴切的企圖丨一位大學生能做到這一個地步，正如潘先生所言，不但於學問進修方面裨益不淺，卽到社會上作事，也就比較容易得多了。</p>
<p>至於第二點，我覺得這眞是潘先生的苦心之言。他提醒一班大學生，對於目前政治局面，應培植一種超然的興趣。他以爲我們現在所處的環境，是一個講究主義的世界。一位大學生，要是没有超然的興趣，早晚便會加入它們的隊伍。這在它們當然可以增多一分力量，可是於自己就有莫大的損失。所以他主張「你個人的政治活動，應當展緩至大學畢業以後。在没有畢業以前，你對於政治的興趣，應當和對於其他學問和事物一樣，完全取超然的方式，絲毫不受私人利益關係的支配」。蔡孑民先生告訴我們，「讀書不忘救國，救國不忘讀書」。我們的國家，現時已弄到這樣糟了，凡屬國人，都應盡匹夫之責，替國家效點勞。况在學生是社會的中堅分子，豈容我袖手旁觀，埋頭書本嗎？故我以爲一個大學生從事於救國運動，是値得鼓勵的。然而自動的爲國犧牲是可以的，被利用作私人或黨派的活動，就應該反對。這潘先生說得很明白：「我以爲敎一個思想不成熟，學議不充實的人入黨，不但無益於這個個人，並且妨害了一個黨的組織」。這話說得何等透徹。我覺到在現時狀態之下，這一點比工具的學問更爲切要。</p>
<p>上面是我讀完了潘先生這封信後的一點感想。最後潘先生的結論是這樣的：「做到了第二點，就可以安放你求學的心，做到了第一點，更可以充實你求學的力。心和力都有了着落，你才不辜負國家，社會，與家庭所給你的優渥的機會」。</p>

<h3>睡覺的藝術（下）逸鷺</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>生理學家從來没有把眼睛睜得這樣大過，他呆呆地朝上望着天花板，一隻手慢慢地伸到衣袋裏，摸出一個買司干香烟匣子。匣蓋是開了，但裏面保剩了支半截的烟屁股。咱家知道是没有咱的份了，還是繼續下去：丨</p>
<p>早上，鐘敲了十點。那張床又震動了一下。男子醒了，探出頭來望了望鐘，「喲！十點鐘」？那女人也好像驚醒了，」忙什麽？來，再睡一刻兒」。「公司裏有事呢。「喔唷！你是總經理啊」！女人的手伸過來了，終於男子的頭也跟着倒下去。……朋友，你且想一想，這不是藝術，是什麽」？</p>
<p>生理學家有些興奮了，不到半寸長的烟屁股還拿在手裏。但，他很聰敏，他懂得這是布爾喬亞。突然地，他把這烟屁股丢了，好像很不平却又很失望似的。終於他拚出這麽一句不願示弱的話來：「這是藝術？藝術是一般的」。</p>
<p>「一般嗎？唔，這不過是我舉一個例罷了。像咱們這種窮酸子，配得上領略這種富麗堂皇的藝術嗎？休想，休想，三休想。可是，咱們睡覺，自有咱們的美慰。咱們旣撈不到ClerkBookkeeper等職位，更没有當什麽行員局員的八字，咱們的睡覺就得自由自在地好不逍遙。咱們要多晚睡，就多晚睡；咱們要多晚起，就多晚起。咱們睡的房間雖然簡陋丨壁上糊了報紙，一張桌子剩了三條腿，拿根木棍代替了斷的一條，二三隻破板橙，睡的床是兩條長板橙擱了一扇門，上面舖了三四寸厚的稻草，一條七穿八洞的被單，又黑又濕的破棉絮毯丨到了咱們睡覺的時候，一樣也能把兩條腿鑽進棉絮毯農，上半身靠在牆上；一樣也能拿一張隔夜的大晚報看着，看着。假使逢到下雨天，那還有更自然，更幽揚的音樂給咱們傾聽享受。那破爛了的水落管裏漏到地上的喳啦啦的水聲，雨打在糊着報紙的窗上的噠噠聲，再加着這報紙着了潮，受了風的吹動發出的撲撲聲丨丨這些都够咱們享受的。如果鬧下歡喜聽個小調兒，那更不妨懇求你那位小脚太太唱個……正月裏···睡迷···鬧元宵，··我看··妹子生得標···再若是明天没有米下鍋，那使性地蒙着頭睡牠個連底凍。「處涸轍以猶歡」，「不亦君子乎」？丨丨這更不是一種「無　的藝術嗎？爲什麽不一般呢」？</p>
<p>生理學家又有些興奮了，好像因爲咱家提起了他的太太。面上微微地露出了一線笑容，但一轉瞬間，又沉下去了。接連着，他歎了一口氣，没有話。畢竟他受過唯物論的引誘，一定在想着：慚愧，漸愧！</p>
<p>「但是，世界上事，不能絶對，總得有個例，睡覺可以稱爲藝術也是如此。大腹便便們的睡覺，固然是藝術：窮而没路走的朋友們的睡覺，更是藝術，但是那輩捧着飯碗觫觫抖，而盛着别人家的飯的人們，就領略不到睡覺的美慰，他們的睡覺就不能算藝術。朋友，你得明白：睡覺的美慰是在已睡未着時，和已醒未起時領略到的。他們睡覺時，納頭便倒，一倒便着；到天明，一醒便起，這還有什麽藝術可言呢？假使，他們也講起藝術來，必致飯碗和他們勢不兩立，弄得停生意才罷。所以咱們還是幸福。雖然没有人來可憐咱們，却也没人來干涉咱們，管咱們。那咱們多不快活？睡覺的美慰也能領略個暢快」！</p>
<p>生理學家面部没有表情。這時咱家倒實在引起了一肚子的心事，有些「感數</p>
<p>慨係之矣」了。沿着床邊來來去去踱了幾個來回，忽然眼前發現了一線光明，這光明越來越大，越大越亮，终於將咱家照得豁然開朗，禁不住喊了出來：「放着人生大道不走，偏在這兒鑽狗洞，豈不愚蠢？明天把床底下的舊書，揀一捆出來，送到城隍廟裏的舊書店去，換一塊錢來，回頭到新北門口買他一條航空奬劵，中了五萬元，不就立地成佛了嗎」？想不到生理學家起而應聲曰：「善哉斯言！老夫當起而效法也」。（完）</p>
<h3>流浪兒傳（四）</h3>
<p>— 陳静生製</p>
<p>聽！打門聲　原來是匹戰馬</p>
<h3>春，値得讚美嗎</h3>
<p>— 小之</p>
<p>丨追念逝去了的冬丨</p>
<p>春，總是永遠給人們在讚美愛慕着的春，又確確實實的回到人間來了。自然界裏是煥然換了一種新的活躍的氣象，好多人，這自然是在讚美着它的那些人囉，也確確實實是改變了一副笑的温暖的面孔，他們的口中聲聲地喊着：「迎春接福哪！」</p>
<p>但是，春，我就最討厭它，恕恨它，詛咒它，一年四季之中，春對於我的印像，是最壞了！因爲它從没帶給我過什麽「福」它帶給我的，只是煩惱的苦悶的咒詛的温暖！這温暖曾使我害過好多的病，至太也要勾發我的舊疾，我的活躍的前進的精神統統給它的蠱惑賺去了，而軟綿綿地成了傷感頽廢的人！</p>
<p>這節季該是如何可咒詛的節季啊！它的温暖欺騙了我，也欺騙了許許多多和我同命運的人，它麻醉了我，也麻醉了許許多多和同我命運的人！然而，人，可憐蟲般的人，他們還是痴心等待它「福」的賜與，樂之降臨，這不太違背情理了麽？</p>
<p>也許春到了人間，使那枯老的樹發得嫩芽，萎黄的草生出綠烟，使這人間另外換上一幅紅紅綠綠的顔色，萬物都出了一個生蘇的轉機，然而，春帶給人們的春意，却永遠是這樣憂鬱的，懶散的，苦悶的，憔悴的，把人的活力，人的朝氣，像一個催眠術家一樣被牠催走了，人到了，人到了春天，就失了生命之力，這正和草木到了春天就得生蘇之機，恰恰相反。</p>
<p>這樣說，物的世界與人的世界，是求遠不相調和的，春，被許許多多的人羡慕着的春，永遠只給與人們以憂鬱，以麻醉，以懶洋洋地不能活下去的力，這處徵着人的没落，物的繁榮，古來許多疾心的詩人倒在物的世界裏去找尋着春意，然而從來却末看見有那一個痴心的詩人在人的世界裏發出歡樂之聲來。詩人在人的世界裏，永遠找不到春意，他們找到的　　是一些　　　成空，　如一夢中」那樣悽凉的嘆息。</p>
<p>春的意味是這樣予人以憂鬱，以麻醉，以無聊的傷感和頽廢，這裏倒使我對於剛剛逝去的冬發生了無限的留戀而致最大的敬禮了！因爲冬，嚴寒偉大的冬，它雖然對人們施行着它無上的威力，呌許許多多的人屈伏至甚犧牲在它的嚴威之下，然而正因爲它這至大無上的壓力，就針針地刺激着人的神經，呌人們得着了一個有力的警告：「防衞呀！防衞這凶酷的寒冬！」想吧，一個人飢了，除非他是痴子，弱者，他去白白等着餓死嗎？同樣的，寒了，他自然會發生出一種求生的大勇和活力來！再看吧，這節季裏，風之怒吼，樹的呌囂，堅脆的冰，冽凛的雪，刺骨的寒，殭硬，迸血……這還不够緊張和警惕嗎？挣扎，振作，激發，奮鬥，就成了這節季裏的活躍的前進的必然的力的反應！</p>
<p>冬，緊緊地迫着人們握着生之力，拚着全生之火，活躍於純潔的雪洗凈了的人間，多麽的雄壯，多麽的偉大，誰有力，誰就有生，這又多麽生動，多麽勇敢，而有正義之氣呵！</p>
<p>春，雖然也有它的烈焰，但這烈焰僅能燒毁人的生命，惹人愁悶，引人燃起趨於墮落之身的勇氣，催人入夢鄉，……春，造出這許多「人的罪惡，」春，還値得我們讚美嗎？</p>
<p>我們不能忘懷於冬之給與我們的剌激，偉大的生命之活力，警覺的人們，騰然地抱着冬之莊嚴，通敢的以明槍交戰的氣慨！然而在春之麻醉下，我們究竟還須要鼓起戰鬥的精神來！</p>

<h3>不要她了</h3>
<p>編者先生</p>
<p>我現年二十歲，在十七歲時，由父母之命，媒妁之言，同本里前村一個女子訂了婚。我們的鄉俗，女子大都到外邊去做廠。所以這個女子，也在附近廠裏做工。去年工廠因虧耗停開，對方生活困難，全家遷居到上海來謀生。到了萬惡不作的上海，不久這個女子已和人家發生戀愛。這個是人家傳來消息，没有確實的證據；後來家裏忽然接到從上海寄的一封無頭信，内容是說「這個女子在外不守婦道專瘦和亂人胡調，呌我母親立刻到上海來領回去」等事。我的母親置之不問，聽便他去，我得到這個消息當然是想解除婚約不要她了。但是没有妥當的辦法，現在把幾個問題寫在下面。請敎先生</p>
<p>（一）倘使登報聲明解除婚約，在法律上能否生效？</p>
<p>（二）拿無頭信能否可以作證據，在法律上可否生效？</p>
<p>（三）以前的聘金可否追還？</p>
<p>此頌</p>
<p>撰安　張孟炯謹上</p>
<p>編者按：張君所詢各點，分别答覆如下：</p>
<p>（一）婚約須向法院訴請解除，不是用「登報聲明」就可了事的。</p>
<p>（二）無頭信是不可以作證的。</p>
<p>（三）婚約無效，有過失之一方，應對於無過失之一方，負回復原狀之責。所以張君解除婚約，如果過失是在對方，自可向他索還聘金。</p>
<p>總之，張君對於他的未婚妻，現在還不能斷定她究竟與人通姦否，所以似還没有法定解除婚約條件作根據。不過這種婚約，旣非張君自己訂立，那麽就是否認也無妨礙，但這是應當由張君自行斟酌，自己决定，編者不能硬勸張君去進行解除婚約。</p>
<p>代郵：徐錚壽君鑒：囑查詢之事，因事冗未克即覆，至歉。</p>

<h3>露露的勝利（七）</h3>
<p>— 義大利M賽拉歐著景心譯</p>
<p>「羅勃特坐在車裏從這兒走過去了，他是穿着灰色的外衣。」</p>
<p>「天哪！這些你怎麽全都曉得呢？我以爲你是在讀書了！」</p>
<p>「我方才正坐在窗邊。」</p>
<p>「你没有看羅勃時，你就認識出他來了？奇怪！他對你鞠躬了麽？」</p>
<p>「是的。」</p>
<p>「他怎樣脫下了他的帽子的？」</p>
<p>「喔！就像他平常一樣。」</p>
<p>「你對他答禮了麽？」</p>
<p>「你以爲我是懂禮節的麽？」</p>
<p>「至少你對他微笑了吧？」</p>
<p>「没有！那是···我不曉得。」</p>
<p>「你是無味的，蘇菲亞。昨天晚上羅勃特對我講了你。」</p>
<p>「他告訴你我是無味的？」</p>
<p>「不，但是他問我，爲什麽你的性格這麽冷淡，和我的性格這麽不同。於是我對他好好　地背了一大篇頌辭；我告訴他你是比我更好，更温柔，更可愛，你的唯一的缺，就是你把這些善良的特質都隱藏起來了。你想想看吧，你懷着極大的興趣靜聽着我的講話；最後，他問我爲什麽我討厭他丨丨」</p>
<p>「討厭他？」</p>
<p>「他是這麽說的，你要曉得，他的話並没有完全錯的；你對待他太不親切了。但就是在這一點上，我都替你辯護；我說了一個小謊，我告訴他你的確是非常地歡喜他，而且你是極崇高地讚揚他丨丨」</p>
<p>「露露！」</p>
<p>「我曉得這話是不眞實的，但是羅勃特很喜歡你，而你對待他像一個陌生人似地不是太無情義了麽？」</p>
<p>「蘇菲亞張開了雙臂抱住了她妹妹的𩓐子，吻着她；露露忍了一會兒，發着可愛的聲音悄悄地說：</p>
<p>「爲什麽你不稍爲喜歡羅勃特一點呢？」</p>
<p>這個姊姊突然地停了一下，一句話也不講退開身了。</p>

<h3>Sun's Attitude is Stubborn, Hope for Peace is Slim</h3>
<p>Li Ming Returns to San Sheng Gong from Ning Territory After Meeting with Sun</p>
<p>Lu Fengnian Makes No Concrete Assurance Regarding Sun's Departure from the Military</p>
<p>Ping Authorities Order Jin Troops to Rapidly Advance Westward to Implement Joint Suppression</p>
<h3>Fu et al. Issue Joint Proclamation Admonishing Officers and Soldiers; Part of the Jin-Sui Army Has Crossed the River</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Li Ming telegraphed Ping, reporting on his meeting with Sun in the Huangquqiao area north of Pingluo. Sun's attitude remained very stubborn and he showed no intention of leaving the military. Li has returned from Ning territory to Yi Sheng Gong and transferred by car back to Bao. After meeting with Fu, he will return to Ping. The three representatives, Fu ZhanKui, Wang ZhongQuan, and Zhang XuanZe, are all still at San Sheng Gong. It is not yet confirmed whether they will go to Dengkou. The Ping military authorities believe that the key to Lu Fengnian's representative Yu Muxing's proposal to have Sun's troops reorganized by the Jin army lies in whether Sun leaves the military. It does not matter which side reorganizes his troops. Yu has telegraphed Lu to convey the opinions here. Last night, Yu received a reply telegram from Lu, which still provided no concrete assurance regarding Sun's departure from the military. The authorities believe that since Sun has no sincerity, a peaceful resolution is almost impossible. The only option is to take the military joint suppression route. In recent days, they have been ordering the Jin-Sui armies to rapidly advance westward. Feng Yuxi, the commander of the Jin army's Independent Third Brigade, left Datong yesterday afternoon on a special train with his brigade headquarters staff for Sui and then Bao. The defense of Datong has been taken over by Li Fuying's troops under Yan's command. Fu is still stationed in Baotou. Zhao Chengshou personally went to the front to inspect. Wang Jingguo is scheduled to leave Bao within days to go west to Linhe to supervise the troops. Sun's troops at Bulunzi San Sheng Gong are composed of Lu Fengnian and Peng Zhenguo's units. They have been building fortifications for days, very close to the advancing troops of Jin-Sui, but have not yet formally made contact. The Jin-Sui armies have begun to advance, implementing joint suppression with the Gan-Ning-Qing troops. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Baotou states that Sun's troops are actively repairing existing fortifications in Dengkou Shizuizi by forcibly conscripting civilians, indicating a will to resist. Dou Pengxi's brigade has built solid fortifications on the west bank of the Wu River. The advance team is on the west bank of the Yangjia River, on guard against us. The Jin-Sui armies are advancing towards Dengkou. Fu, Wang, and Zhao have jointly issued a proclamation admonishing all officers and soldiers to quell rebellion, uphold the law, secure the borders, save the people, bravely eliminate the wicked, and forever suppress the seeds of chaos. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Pingbei) A telegram from Baotou states that after the Jin-Sui army occupied Huangyangmutou, Sun's army, with approximately two brigades or more of infantry, has taken over the area of Duolunnuo near San Sheng Gong. They are now building fortifications eastward and cutting off traffic. A Jin-Sui cavalry unit has crossed the river and advanced to BalaYi. The remaining infantry and artillery units are actively deploying, and will soon attack San Sheng Gong. Fu arrived in Linhe on the 5th and arranged to meet with Sun in Dengkou on the morning of the 6th. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to related sources, after Fu departed west from Baotou, Fu and Sun decided to meet in Dengkou. Li Ming has arrived in Ningxia. It is reported that Li met with Sun in Li Gangbu. Although Sun verbally expressed his willingness to leave the military immediately, his attitude remained ambiguous. Sun's cavalry unit, under Yu Shiming, was willing to be reorganized under the command of the Military Branch Council, but they are now being monitored by Sun's infantry. Therefore, the cavalry's activity has been limited recently. If the Jin-Sui armies can advance and exert pressure before the Yellow River thaws, the problem will be easier to resolve. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin stated in a written reply to reporters that he has only seen reports about the position of Commander of the Mongolian Autonomous Political Affairs Council and has not received a clear order. Guiding Mongolian autonomy is a heavy responsibility, and he fears he is not competent. The address of the Commander's Office is not yet under discussion. Fu has arrived at the front, but no report has been received on whether he has met with Sun. Lu Fengnian's representative Yu Muxing has met with him several times, but concrete measures have not yet been decided. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Lanzhou states that Ma Buqing's troops have advanced from Zhongwei towards Ningyuan and established contact with Ma Hongkui's troops. The defense of Ningyuan is solid. Sun's troops are gradually moving towards Pingluo. Ma Bufang has stationed troops in Zhongwei. Lu Dachang went to the front on the morning of the 8th to command military operations. More than half of Yang Houxiao's remnant bandits have been eliminated by Meng Shiquan's brigade under Lu's command. Wang Ying's remnant bandits have a tendency to flee to northern Shaanxi. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Li Ming arrived in Ningyuan on the 8th and met with Ma Hongkui to discuss everything. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Sun Dianying's troops violated orders, and the war in Ningxia has continued, causing great suffering to the refugees. The Military Affairs Commission telegraphed a reply to the Gansu circles' relief committee for Ningxia war refugees, stating that the telegram has been received and that the Ping branch will handle the sanctioning of Sun's troops. As for providing disaster relief and helping the refugees, the Executive Yuan should be in charge. This is a special reply. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Tao Shangming Will Go to Yuyu to Conduct Negotiations with Japan</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Tao Shangming arrived at the provincial government at the afternoon of the 9th to visit Yu Xuezhong. Tao is scheduled to return to Tangshan on the 10th and plans to go to Yuguan in a week to negotiate with Yi regarding the collection of taxes by the bogus customs and the return of our telegraph office. Recently, the bogus customs has implemented new tariffs. The bogus customs at Shanhaiguan levies extremely high tax rates on goods exported from us to the Eastern Provinces, so that products of eastern Luan, such as reed mats, water tanks, felt leather, and local goods, which used to rely on the Northeast as a market, cannot be exported due to tariff barriers. Furthermore, our and the bogus customs both have customs offices in Yuguan, and the boundaries are unclear. The Ministry of Finance telegraphed Tao to negotiate. Tao, in order to avoid the suspicion of directly negotiating with the bogus Ministry of Finance, has decided to negotiate with Yi. The director of the Shanhaiguan Public Security Bureau has sent personnel to Panku, Xifeng Kou and Jieling Kou to handle matters, which is practically the same as taking over. Tao Shangming requested the provincial government to establish an auxiliary administration bureau at the three passes, raise the authority of the police agencies, and request the Industrial and Rehabilitation Group to allocate 50,000 yuan to set up long-distance telephones, connecting to the small passes of Shanhaiguan, which will be collected by the Yuguan police. Su Yuqi, the director of the Public Security Bureau, came to Tianjin today for this matter to report to the provincial government. Tao Shangming told people that the rumor of martial law being declared in various parts of eastern Luan is baseless. The topic of martial law is too big, how can it be implemented casually? (9th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong told reporters that after Zhang returns to Hankou in a few days, he should still go to visit, but it will be purely for reminiscing and nothing else. After Yuguan was taken over, there are still many minor problems in the local area. Commissioner Tao is responsible for handling these problems and is currently continuing to do so. Tao came to Tianjin recently to report to the provincial government on the negotiations. Japanese troops stationed at the Suohe Bridge in Jianchangying and transporting military supplies through the Luan River are all being negotiated. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Bogus Police at Nantianmen Have Not Yet Withdrawn</h3>
<p>(Pingbei) After Gubeikou was taken over, the bogus police at Nantianmen have not yet withdrawn and are still operating as usual. Huo Shi, the director of the Gubeikou office, and Liu Youxun, the director of the auxiliary administration bureau, have telegraphed Yin Rugeng, requesting him to forward the negotiations with the Japanese side and urge the Japanese side to order the bogus police there to withdraw. There are still bogus police at the five small passes near Gubei, Caojia Road and Paizi Road. Today, Liu Wanda, the director of the Miyun Public Security Bureau, selected qualified policemen and squad leaders, each leading ten policemen, to go to the various passes to take over. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng said that the name of the wartime security brigade will be changed to the wartime security supplementary regiment. The selection of the regimental commander is in progress. The number of security troops to be reorganized has been confirmed to be 1,000. The rest will be given severance pay and dismissed. The garrison location is set in Yutian. After the reorganization is completed, they will be transferred elsewhere. Regarding the withdrawal of the bogus police at Nantianmen, he has asked the Japanese embassy to telegraph Matsui, the head of the Chengde Special Affairs Agency, to order the bogus police there to withdraw. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Plan for Reorganizing the Yutian Special Police is Drafted</h3>
<p>Yin Rugeng and Han Zhanbang Arrive in Ping</p>
<p>Will Proceed to Yutian Within Days to Handle the Matter</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong said that the solution to the Yutian special police matter has already been discussed and decided. Commissioner Yin is scheduled to return to Ping today, and will go to Yutian with Brigade Commander Han Dianbang within a day or two to reorganize the troops. It has been decided that the unit will be reorganized according to one thousand men, and no more than that. After the reorganization is completed, the provincial government will send personnel to call the roll and distribute salaries to prevent fraud and confusion. If this matter is not handled thoroughly, it will easily lead to future troubles. After the provincial government appointed Han as the leader of the unit, the squad leader Sun Peilin telegraphed to welcome him. The others did not express themselves. In short, it is still uncertain whether they will listen to the reorganization. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng went to Tianjin to visit Yu to report on the process of taking over Gubeikou and to ask for instructions on the Yutian follow-up matters. He returned to Ping tonight after completing the matter. Han Dianbang, the new leader of the Yutian County Security Team, came with him. Yin is scheduled to visit He and Huang on the 10th and then go to Yutian with Han and others. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The provincial government has drafted a plan for the reorganization of the Yutian Special Police and handed it over to Yin Rugeng for responsible handling. Yin has already raised the severance pay and will go to handle the matter within three to five days after Yin returns to Ping tonight. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yin Rugeng and Han Dianbang, the newly appointed security team leader of Yutian, went to Ping on the 9th, and will go to Yutian on the 11th to reorganize Hu XieWu's troops. Shi Yousan told people that the provincial government's appointment of a new team leader for the reorganization of the Yutian Security Team can be done with confidence, and he will never instruct the old troops to take any action. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Nakamura Departs from Yuyu for Shenyang</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Nakamura Kōtarō, the Japanese commander in North China, arrived in Yuyu last night from Tianjin on a special train on the Beining Railway. Okawa, the commander of the Japanese garrison in Yuguan, led more than 100 Japanese soldiers to the station to stand guard, temporarily cutting off traffic. After Nakamura got off the train, he went to the Nanhai Japanese barracks to rest. He inspected the garrison this morning and left Yuyu for Shenyang on a special express train on the bogus Fengshan Railway at 9:30. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Conduct Field Exercises Along the Tang-Yu Section</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Starting at 8:00 this morning, Japanese troops stationed in Tangshan conducted field exercises along the Tang-Yu section of the Beining Railway. This exercise is scheduled to last from today until the evening of the 12th. Our side has negotiated to stop it, but it is ineffective due to the Xin Chou Treaty. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Passes and Approves the Silver Agreement</h3>
<p>With an Attached Reservation to Avoid Being Restricted by the Agreement</p>
<p>Difficult Issues After Ratification</p>
<p>Ma Yinchu Issues a Statement Soliciting Public Opinion</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The approval of the Silver Agreement caused a stir due to the US raising the price of silver. Furthermore, the Central Political Council's Review Committee on the 27th determined that the US's countermeasures to raise the price of silver and the approval of the agreement were two completely separate matters. The Central Political Council resolved on the 28th in principle to pass it and submit it to the Legislative Yuan for review. After receiving the consultation, the Legislative Yuan handed it over to the Foreign Affairs, Finance, and Economic Committees. At 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 8th, they held a joint review meeting. More than ten committee members, including Ma Yinchu, Chen Changheng, Wei Tingsheng, Fu Bingchang, and Shi Weihuan, concluded from the review that the agreement should be approved, but with an attached reservation, that is, "if there is danger to Chinese industry, China may take necessary actions," so as not to be restricted or bound by the agreement. After drafting the articles, they were submitted to the 50th Yuan meeting on the 9th for secret review. After detailed discussion, it was passed according to the review opinion, with an attached reservation statement, passing the Silver Agreement. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Yinchu, Chairman of the Finance Committee of the Legislative Yuan, believes that after the Silver Agreement is approved, if the price of silver continues to rise, the following four problems will inevitably occur, and it is quite difficult how we should deal with them. He specifically solicited public opinion: (1) The difficulty of prohibiting the export of silver. The US policy of raising the price of silver is already clearly visible. After we approve the agreement, although we can attach a reservation, we are afraid that we will not be able to resist its policy. In order to limit the outflow of silver, it may be necessary to explicitly prohibit the export of silver. However, since the implementation of the US policy of raising the price of silver, the difference between Chinese and American silver prices has already been seen, and now it is 5%. Once we prohibit the export of silver, the difference will inevitably be greater. Because our trade deficit is very large, usually Chinese merchants buy US dollars, and if the exchange rate of US dollars is very expensive, they can transport silver for export to offset it, so the exchange rate of US dollars will not be too expensive. If the export of silver is prohibited, the rising trend of the US dollar exchange rate cannot be curbed. The rise in the exchange rate of the US dollar is the fall in the exchange rate of our silver coins, which is the further fall in our silver price. As a result, the difference between Chinese and American silver prices will be even greater. Wouldn't it be even more profitable for those who smuggle silver for export? I am afraid that the prohibition will not be effective. The effect of prohibiting the export of silver is very small; if it is not prohibited, it will flow out, and even if it is prohibited, it cannot prevent its outflow. How should this point be dealt with? (2) The difficulty of levying export tax on raw silver. If the export of silver is not directly prohibited, or only a corresponding export tax is levied to show restriction, the amount of the levy should be equivalent to the difference between the domestic and foreign silver prices. In normal times, it can have the effect of restricting exports, but now the price of silver is showing a trend of continuing to rise, which is clearly visible. If today the difference is 5%, next month it may rise to 15%. When we start levying taxes, assuming that the difference between Chinese and American silver prices is 5%, and we levy a 50% export tax, even if foreign banks have to comply with the regulations and pay, they can still transport as much as possible and temporarily store it in Hong Kong and other places to wait for opportunities. If it rises to 15%, they can still earn a profit of 10% after removing the 5% export tax, so the effect of restriction is limited. How should this point be prevented? (3) The worry about the lack of chips. Foreign banks have already transported silver for export and their inventories are empty, but in a position of trade deficit, the amount of money that Chinese merchants owe foreign merchants is more than the amount of money that foreign merchants owe Chinese merchants. Foreign banks must withdraw silver from Chinese banks to offset the debt, which reduces the reserve of Chinese banks, shakes the foundation of credit, will inevitably contract, and the chips will become less and less, and prices will fall even more. Therefore, our prices will be affected by two major influences: one is that prices will fall due to the high price of silver, and the other is that prices will fall due to insufficient chips. May I ask, can the agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors, which are already in a state of panic, withstand this pressure? How should this point be prevented? (4) The cunning tricks of foreign banks are difficult to prevent. The strangest thing is that even if foreign banks do not transport raw silver from China, they can still sell the silver in their vaults to the US government, and only need to seal the silver in the vaults and regard it as the US government's deposit. When there is a suitable opportunity in the future, they can then transport it out. Even if they do not transport it out, the US government's purpose can still be achieved, because its purpose is not to use it but to seal it, so that the price of silver rises. Therefore, depositing it in China is regarded as part of the overseas gold reserves. As for our government, because extraterritoriality has not been recovered, it has no right to utilize this deposit. Therefore, although the silver is still nominally in China, in practice it is no different from being transported out. May I ask, what method can we use to force them to sell it? How should this point be dealt with? (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the 9th, Ma Yinchu issued a statement to the Central News Agency reporters on his personal countermeasures to deal with the rise in silver prices. First, he stated that the Silver Agreement and the rise in silver prices are closely related. After the US raised the price of silver, our country, as a silver standard country, has been greatly affected. However, Article 4 of the agreement stipulates that our country may not sell silver that has been melted from coins, which in other words, restricts us from switching to the gold standard within four years. Given the length of four years, it is difficult to predict the extent of international financial changes. If left to its own course, prices will fall twice as much, foreign goods will flow in, and the agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors will all go bankrupt. The danger is extremely high. Therefore, approving the agreement with an attached reservation means that if silver rises to the highest level, we can take this opportunity to switch to the gold standard. After exchanging silver for gold, we can avoid being slaughtered by others. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The New Life Movement and Leaders - Ting</h3>
<p>Recently, leaders in the country have enthusiastically promoted the New Life Movement. For example, Liu Zhenhua in Henan, Lu Zhonglin in Hebei, Han Fuju in Shandong, Yang Hucheng in Shaanxi, and He Jian in Hunan have all advocated frugality, which has attracted general attention. However, the most influential is, of course, the New Life Movement in Nanchang, led by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. The provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang have also been somewhat influenced by the repeated speeches of Central Committee member Chen Lifu in Hangzhou.</p>
<p>The New Life Movement promoted by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek emphasizes expressing propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame in daily life, that is, to integrate people's livelihood and morality. Propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame are the foundation of "self-reliance and helping others" advocated by sages and wise men of China over thousands of years. It cannot be said to have any new components. However, given the current weakness of national self-confidence and the vulgarity of people's hearts, this is indeed the right medicine. Moreover, it is even more noteworthy that the pillars of the country are personally advocating it, hoping that leaders from all walks of life will "practice what they preach."</p>
<p>The Chinese nation originally had four advantages that other nations could not match: first, emphasis on peace; second, strong resistance; third, ability to assimilate others; and fourth, diligence, thrift, and optimism. However, in the current environment, these four advantages have not been able to develop evenly, but have formed a deformed state. For example, "peace" and "resistance" seem contradictory, but they are actually a manifestation of the national psychology formed by the doctrine of the mean. Emphasis on peace should have adopted a positive attitude, but in fact, it has degenerated into passivity. As a result, due to the inability to resist the oppression of powerful neighbors, frustration, disappointment, and fear of retreat have occurred. This is ironclad proof of the decline of national self-confidence. However, this bad phenomenon must be shouldered by a small group of people. It cannot be attributed to the entire nation's lack of ambition, let alone to the idea that the Chinese nation is "terminally ill" and incurable. We said in our comments a few days ago on the Rejuvenation Movement in Henan and Shandong provinces that the depth of customs changes with the intentions of the leading figures. Ordinary people are like flowing water, flowing to the east or west depending entirely on the intentions of the leaders, and cannot have automatic ideas. If the direction of guidance is correct, small streams can converge into huge rivers, surging down. "The force is so great that nothing can stop it." The authority contained in every drop of water will then be gathered and brought into play. We believe that the current promotion of the New Life Movement is not so much the leaders' "implementation of new plans" as their duty. However, conversely, this duty of first promoting can only be fulfilled effectively by the leaders. In that case, it cannot but be regarded as a right exclusively enjoyed by a few of them. Rights and obligations are two sides of the same coin. Rights are enjoyed by the leaders, and they cannot but fulfill their obligations.</p>
<p>Recently, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said, "The reason why the revolution did not succeed in the past, despite the sacrifice of so many talented people and patriots, and the country is still in such a precarious state, is that those of us in charge did not thoroughly research and do things practically, and we made the mistake of being casual." These "self-blaming" words are honest and frank and are worth listening to, reflecting on, and thoroughly repenting by other leaders.</p>
<p>Although we do not need to adhere to the idea of "heroes create the times," a review of the Twenty-Four Histories reveals how many stories of governance, chaos, and demise. Generally, in an extraordinary era, the role of people is greater than in ordinary times. Political leaders who revived the nation in Chinese history, such as Emperor Wu of Han and Emperor Taizong of Tang, relied on one or two major events to call on the people and start anew with the people at the beginning of their founding. They all felt that the rise and fall of the nation was their greatest responsibility, so they were willing to suppress their personal status and dignity, encourage remonstrance, and open avenues of speech, correcting their own mistakes. The more profound a leader's spirit of "accepting advice like a river" and "rejoicing in hearing criticism," the greater their success, and the more profound their contribution to the future of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen advocated the restoration of national self-confidence for forty years, and he especially valued the inherent Chinese political philosophy of "cultivating oneself, regulating one's family, governing the state, and pacifying the world." The New Life Movement, which is now being vigorously promoted, aims to use China's inherent morality as its center to awaken our declining national self-confidence. It is in line with Sun Yat-sen's teachings. We believe that it is a major event worth calling on the people of the whole country. The New Life Movement is personally promoted by the pillars of the country, and those who personally promote it are willing to embrace the attitude of admitting mistakes and correcting them, which may be a major turning point for the Chinese nation. If the leaders are willing to "practice what they preach" and work practically, there will be no shortage of people who will follow suit. The New Life Movement, which caused a sensation for a while, will have a hope of success.</p>
<h3>British Political Trends - The Labour Party Achieves a Great Victory in the London Municipal Elections</h3>
<p>The Conservative Party Loses Ground, the Liberal Party Suffers a Miserable Defeat</p>
<p>The Labour Party Controls the City Council for the First Time</p>
<p>(London) The triennial elections for the London City Council expired yesterday, and voting began yesterday. According to the results that have been announced, the Labour Party has achieved the greatest victory. The City Council has 124 seats, and the Labour Party has now won 61 seats, the Municipal Reform Party has 37 seats, and the remaining 26 seats have not yet been announced. The election competition in London is highly valued, because the degree of public support for the government can be seen from this. The Municipal Reform Party lost 25 seats this time, and its inability to grasp power is almost certain. The original positions were as follows: the Municipal Reform Party had 83 seats, the Labour Party had 35 seats, and the Liberal Party had 6 seats. The Municipal Reform Party is aligned with the Conservative Party in policy. Which party the remaining 26 seats belong to will be clear today. The Labour Party's main focus this time was the housing issue. They said that although the London City Council approved a plan to build 2,000 houses in 1930, very few houses have been built. The Labour Party advocates clearing slums and establishing garden cities. The Labour Party also advocates increasing rents for the rich to adjust rents for the poor. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) According to the latest news, as a result of the London City elections, the Labour Party has gained another three seats. The Labour Party controls the London City Council, which is a first in history. The joy of the Labour Party is evident. Its leader, Morrison, the former Minister of Transport, said today that this victory is very gratifying and that there will be a real change in policy. Jessel, the leader of the Municipal Reform Party, blamed the voters for being too indifferent, causing the Labour Party to win. All sixteen Communist Party city council candidates were defeated. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) Yesterday, nationwide municipal self-government elections were held, and the Labour Party clearly achieved victory. The London City Government, known as the world's largest city, has since fallen into the hands of the Labour Party. Moreover, previous by-elections for the House of Commons have repeatedly proven to be somewhat unfavorable to the National Cabinet. Finally, one more thing is worth noting: the political life of the Liberal Party in the London area has completely disappeared. In most other constituencies, the Liberal Party has only become an appendage of the Labour Party. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) The final results of the London City Council election are as follows: Labour Party 69 seats (previously 35 seats), Municipal Reform Party 55 seats (previously 83 seats), Liberal Party (previously 6 seats) none elected. There are ten doctors in the new council. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>Zheng Xiaoxu Will Go to Japan</h3>
<p>Departing from Changchun on the 21st</p>
<p>(Changchun) "Manchukuo" took the opportunity of implementing the imperial system to specially send (puppet) Prime Minister Zheng Xiaoxu to Japan to express respect to the Japanese Imperial Family and to promote the friendship between Japan and Manchukuo. Zheng will depart from Changchun on the 21st. (Puppet) Minister of the Interior Shen Ruilin and (Puppet) Deputy Chief of the General Affairs Department of the State Council, Sakatani Kiichi, will accompany him. On the 22nd, they will take the Ural Maru from Dalian to cross the sea. The Japanese government will treat Prime Minister Zheng as a state guest after he lands in Kobe. (Dentsu, 7th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Imperial Family Member Prince Kaya to Tour Europe and America</h3>
<p>Visiting More Than Twenty Countries</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Imperial Family member Prince Kaya and Princess Kaya left Tokyo Station at 9:25 p.m. on the 8th to travel to Europe and America. It is planned to visit more than twenty countries. The two Highnesses departed from Kobe on the Yasukuni Maru at 3:00 p.m. today. (Nichi Ren, 9th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Celebrity Muto Assassinated</h3>
<p>The Murderer Held a Grudge Due to Unemployment</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Muto Sanji (the current president of Jiji Shinpo, 67 years old this year), accompanied by two secretaries, was walking near his villa in Kamakura, Kanagawa Prefecture, at 9:10 this morning when a strange man suddenly appeared and fired a handgun, wounding Muto and killing one of the secretaries. The perpetrator then shot himself in the chest to commit suicide. Muto was shot three times and is currently being treated at Kamakura Hospital. The murdered secretary's name is Aoki Toru (23 years old). The authorities believe the perpetrator is Fukushima Shinkichi from Oku-cho, Arakawa Ward, Tokyo, and have telegraphed the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department to investigate.</p>
<p>Another telegram states that Muto was severely injured in the legs, jaw, and abdomen. As a result of the authorities' investigation, the perpetrator was Fukushima Shinkichi, an unemployed person, but he has no connection with ideological groups. (Nichi Ren, 9th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Businessman Muto Sanji was shot and seriously injured by a handgun-wielding assailant at his villa in Kamakura this morning, and his life is in danger. Muto is a famous figure in Japanese financial and political circles. He served as the president of the largest cotton spinning mill, Kanebo, for 40 years. Kanebo's prosperity today is entirely due to President Muto. After resigning in 1929, he founded the Political Education Hall. He began his political movement in 1923 and was elected as a member of the Diet three times by organizing the Businessmen's Comrades Association. The Businessmen's Comrades Association was later renamed the National Comrades Association. Muto has now retired from the political world. (Nichi Ren, 9th)</p>
<p>Kamakura When Muto Sanji was assassinated, a police officer asked him the reason. Muto, in great pain, was unable to explain in detail, saying only, "The reason is the crematorium issue. Please ask Mr. Sakuma for details." Therefore, the Kamakura Police Station urgently summoned Muto's secretary, Mr. Sakuma, to the station. The secretary stated that the reason stemmed from a personal grudge. Fukushima planned to establish a crematorium in Kamakura last May or June and asked Muto for a donation, but Muto refused. Later, Muto announced a plan to establish a crematorium, which Fukushima was very angry about, so he decided to kill Muto to vent his anger. Fukushima also held a record of the above situation. (Nichi Ren, 9th)</p>
<p>Kamakura The perpetrator who attacked Muto Sanji, Fukushima Shinkichi, used to be a clerk at the Kyobashi Machinery Company. He is currently unemployed and depends on his wife, Yoshiko's, labor for a living. He decided to commit the crime and suddenly drank at home last night, then took his wife and four children to a nearby movie theater, secretly bidding farewell to his wife. As for his motive for committing the crime, after investigating his wife, it seems that there is no organization behind him. The perpetrator planned to establish a crematorium in Oku last May or June and went to see Muto to request a donation, but Muto refused and obstructed his business, so he deeply resented Muto. Recently, his life has become increasingly difficult due to unemployment, so he attacked Muto. (Dentsu, 9th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Authorities Criticize Japan's Naval Competition</h3>
<p>Strengthening Military Power to Maintain International Peace</p>
<p>Responsibility of All Countries Not to Exceed Treaty Limits</p>
<p>(Washington) Japanese Navy Minister Osumi's declaration that Japan will increase the construction of warships to compete with the U.S. Navy has greatly alarmed Congress and naval circles here today. In response to Osumi's remarks, Georgia Congressman Vinson (the proposer of the Vinson-Trammell Act) declared that the U.S. shipbuilding program does not exceed the scope of the naval treaty. Vinson continued, "Our shipbuilding program aims to eliminate various doubts about naval competition. Our bill aims to fulfill our responsibility for the international balance of power permitted by the treaty. Whether at home or abroad, I have not seen any reason to oppose this plan." Illinois Congressman Britten, one of the main figures advocating the large navy bill, also does not believe that the United States will engage in naval competition. Britten said, "Unless Britain and Japan automatically violate the solemn treaty concluded with us, we do not want to exceed the scope of the treaty. If any of the two countries, Britain and Japan, find our shipbuilding program objectionable, it would be clear evidence that they do not trust us." Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Standley said that the moral obligation of all countries is to maintain the full naval power permitted by the treaty. Standley continued, "All signatories to the London or Washington Treaty should preserve their full naval power to maintain a proper balance of international peace and security. The peace treaty ending the last World War failed to resolve many international difficulties after the war, especially in the Far East. The responsibility of all countries is not to exceed the limits of the treaty. I believe that maintaining the full naval power permitted by the treaty is also the obligation of all countries. If the governments of various countries allow their naval power to weaken, the international balance, peace, and security will inevitably be shaken." (National News Agency, 8th)</p>
<h3>Comparison of U.S. and Japanese Navies</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The naval expansion bill proposed by U.S. Senator Vinson has been passed by both houses of Congress. When this bill is completed, that is, in 1939, the strength of the U.S. Navy will be as follows:</p>
<p>Battleships 15 ships 455,400 tons</p>
<p>Aircraft carriers 6 ships 135,000 tons</p>
<p>Class A cruisers 18 ships 172,650 tons</p>
<p>Class B cruisers 19 ships 157,600 tons</p>
<p>Destroyers 97 ships 150,000 tons</p>
<p>Submarines 40 ships 52,590 tons</p>
<p>Total 195 ships 1,123,240 tons</p>
<p>Comparing this with the strength of Japan's second replenishment plan completion period, that is, 1936, the ratio is 60% for battleships, 62% for aircraft carriers, 62% for Class A cruisers, 73% for Class B cruisers, 67% for destroyers, and 100% for submarines. Therefore, Japan will need to build more various warships after the expiration of the arms reduction treaty in 1936. (Nichi Ren, 9th)</p>
<h3>U.S. House of Representatives Passes Army Budget</h3>
<p>Totaling 299.1 Million Yuan</p>
<p>(Washington) The Army budget, for which the government requested $349,523,000, was amended by the House Appropriations Committee to $279,541,000, and another appropriation was approved to fund aviation expenses, for a total of $291,000,000. The House of Representatives passed the Appropriations Committee's amendment today. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>France Expands Navy</h3>
<p>One Cruiser, One Destroyer, Two Submarines</p>
<p>(Paris) A few days ago, Navy Minister Pietri submitted the 1934 naval shipbuilding program, requesting the construction of one "Dunkerque" class armored cruiser, one destroyer, and two submarines, with a total displacement of approximately 30,000 tons for each ship. The Naval Committee discussed this case and has recently submitted a report advocating that the case be passed quickly, saying that the tonnage of shipbuilding this year is lower than the annual average from 1922 to 1932 and is the minimum to maintain France's naval strength. The second "Dunkerque" class armored cruiser is necessary for the even distribution of two capital ships. As for the destroyer and two submarines, they are replacing old ships that have reached the end of their service life. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>Chinese Military Delegation Visits Soviet Military Organizations</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Today, Soviet People's Commissar for the Army and Navy Voroshilov met with the Chinese military delegation led by Yang Jie.

<h3>The League of Nations Holds Last Hope for Arms Reduction</h3>
<p>Britain Agrees to Joint Sanctions Against Violations of the Convention</p>
<p>French Public Opinion Does Not Oppose German Rearmament</p>
<p>Letter from French Foreign Minister Published in Geneva</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations now holds a final hope for arms reduction, because Britain has changed its attitude and supports joint action against those who violate the arms reduction convention. It is also heard that influential public opinion in France has also shifted regarding the issue of German rearmament.</p>
<p>A white paper on the arms reduction issue was published here today, containing a letter from French Foreign Minister Barthou, explaining France's attitude in simple terms and explaining the reasons for the deadlock in negotiations, saying that France cannot accept any organization of a military nature not being regarded as an army. France also cannot agree that countries bound by military clauses of the treaty can immediately rearm, while other countries must immediately reduce armaments. The letter also stated the need for guarantees when the arms reduction convention is violated, and that some countries are actively rearming regardless of the provisions of the treaty, and this matter should be resolved quickly.</p>
<p>The U.S. memorandum sent to the British Ambassador on February 19 supported the British arms reduction proposal of January 29 and advocated reducing offensive armaments while increasing the defensive armaments of weak countries. The memorandum proposed: (1) Abolishing heavy artillery, large tanks, bombers, and similar weapons used for aggression; (2) Continuing automatic inspection of armaments; (3) Concluding a universal non-aggression pact. The memorandum also stated that the U.S. government will not participate in European political issues, so it will not participate in diplomatic discussions on such issues, but the U.S. government is very concerned about maintaining European peace and welcomes the efforts of the British government. The U.S. government is completely in agreement with the UK that the arms reduction convention is not only necessary but also facilitates a general easing of politics. The memorandum concluded by saying that the U.S. government hopes that the British proposal can lead to the revival of arms reduction talks. It is expected that France can reply to the British proposal of February 9 next week, and progress can be made to facilitate arms reduction negotiations. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>French Cabinet Discusses Reply to Britain</h3>
<p>Can Be Sent Out Next Monday</p>
<p>(Paris) Today it was heard that the French Foreign Ministry's reply to the British arms reduction memorandum will be issued next Monday, gently rejecting the British proposal. (National News Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today's cabinet meeting was chaired by President Lebrun. During the meeting, Foreign Minister Barthou spent two hours giving a detailed report on the diplomatic situation. The issues involved were so important and broad that the points that should be discussed have been changed to the second cabinet meeting next Monday. At that time, Foreign Minister Barthou will answer all questions in detail. Tonight, Barthou declared that he had decided to postpone his trip to Brussels next Monday because he had to attend the cabinet meeting next Monday. According to political sources, it is believed that the Foreign Minister's rescheduling of the trip is to wait for the wave of the Belgian Foreign Minister's declaration on arms reduction to pass before going to Brussels, because according to recent news from Brussels, the Belgian Foreign Minister's declaration has caused conflicts between the Belgian Nationalist Party and the Socialist Party and may involve the cabinet. In addition, the French Military Committee also met this afternoon to discuss the reply to the British arms reduction memorandum. (National News Agency, 8th)</p>
<h3>Baldwin Says the European Situation Is Not Hopeless</h3>
<p>Equality of Air Forces in All Countries Avoids Danger</p>
<p>Establishing Air Force Base in Iraq</p>
<p>(London) British Under-Secretary of State for Air Sassoon presented the Air Force budget in the House of Commons today, including an item of 65,000 pounds to build a new air force base in Diwaniyah, Iraq. Sassoon said that sky surveillance is very effective and described in detail the method used to quell rebellions, saying that warnings are given first, sometimes warnings are issued in the sky using loudspeakers, which is mostly effective. If it cannot be suppressed, dummy bombs are dropped as a warning. As for real bombs, they are not used lightly. Natives often gather to cause trouble, but they scatter because they see airplanes patrolling. Lord Privy Seal Baldwin, when referring to this budget, said that he could not agree with those who said that Lord President of the Council Eden's tour of Europe had failed. This trip has not yet yielded results, but he has never given up hope of establishing a convention based on the British arms reduction plan, which would allow the air forces of all countries to be equal to each other. He knows that this is a necessary condition to avoid danger. If a convention cannot be concluded, the government will not relax its efforts to seek an agreement with Western European countries to preserve European civilization. He does not acknowledge that the situation today is already hopeless, but if all efforts fail and this equality cannot be achieved, the British government will ensure that the British Air Force does not lag behind other countries. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>Belgian Foreign Minister Reaffirms Position on Arms Reduction</h3>
<p>Flexibility Should Be Allowed for Limiting German Armaments</p>
<p>There Is No Real Conflict Between the Views of France and Belgium</p>
<p>Brussels Foreign Minister Hymans stated in the Senate that the comments published in various newspapers mostly misunderstand the declaration on arms reduction issues made by Prime Minister de Broqueville a few days ago and his speech in the Senate. The Foreign Minister continued, "What we rely on is the common sense of the Belgian people. No one can believe that we support German rearmament. We have never said a word about this matter. Some people think that Germany must be forced to disarm in accordance with the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles. Although this statement is reasonable, if it is for a great power, it is argued that such restrictions should be appropriately adjusted to adapt to the current situation. If we take a tough stance and do not allow flexibility, we cannot avoid being arrogant and different, and it is difficult for facts to achieve. Fortunately, France and Belgium are in complete agreement on this matter. All methods of force that are sufficient to cause war are rejected by both France and Belgium. France and Belgium both allow Germany to have troops, but they should be subject to careful restrictions and strict supervision. In addition, France and Belgium have also agreed that sanctions should be imposed if any violations of the established rules occur, and that they should act in unity at all times. This is the only way to prevent Germany's illegal rearmament." (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>Brussels According to the Catholic newspaper Le Vingtième Siècle, a certain important person familiar with Belgian domestic and foreign policy made a declaration stating that Prime Minister de Broqueville publicly expressed deep doubts about the value of the military clauses in the Treaty of Versailles, believing that such clauses are insufficient to provide security, so Belgium has the right to seek other supplementary methods, such as increasing the effectiveness of the Rhineland Pact, so that the left bank of the Rhine River, as stipulated in the pact, becomes a demilitarized zone, and the security of Belgium is guaranteed by France, Britain, and Italy. It should be implemented as well, etc. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Barthou was originally scheduled to travel to Brussels from Geneva to meet with Belgian Foreign Minister Hymans in a private capacity, but the State Council is scheduled to be held on the 12th of this month, so he could not make it in time, so the itinerary was postponed. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Suggests to All Countries the Banning of War-Mongering Broadcasts</h3>
<p>Agreement to Manage International Radio</p>
<p>(Geneva) The draft international broadcasting agreement proposing international management of broadcasting to prohibit war-mongering speeches has been sent by the League of Nations Administrative Council to various countries for their consent. To make radio an effective tool for maintaining peace, this agreement will establish strict checks on radio programs, especially news and political broadcasts. All broadcasting companies should refrain from transmitting any messages that incite war sentiment or provoke international conflict. They should also ensure the accuracy of information on international relations. Governments participating in this treaty should abide by strict penalties for violating international broadcasting rules. The penalty measures are still being drafted. It has been proposed that governments should revoke the licenses or rights of broadcasting companies when broadcasting rules are systematically violated. The International Intellectual Cooperation Organization has been instrumental in the establishment of this treaty. The management of political broadcasting has long been an idea within the International Intellectual Cooperation Organization. As news from Munich indicates, Austria considers it a deliberate attempt to undermine its domestic security. The proposed international broadcasting rules are as follows: (1) Any telegram deliberately sent for a certain country, constituting a hazard to the domestic security of that country, shall be prohibited. (2) Provocative messages are not allowed to be broadcast. (3) Various messages sufficient to affect international cooperation should be prohibited. (4) Strict checks should be implemented during tense situations. (5) Incorrect messages should be corrected immediately. (6) National propaganda should include peaceful programs. These programs should include the living conditions of foreign nations, the development of mutual relations between nations, and organizations related to peace. (7) Governments should issue peaceful rules for national broadcasting. (8) If radio disputes cannot be resolved by diplomatic conventions, they should be submitted to the Hague Supreme Court or the International Intellectual Cooperation Committee. Governments may submit opinions before August 1934. The League of Nations General Assembly on September 24, 1931, resolved that the International Intellectual Cooperation Organization should investigate various international issues that arise and are sufficient to affect good international relations. The Disarmament Conference on the issue of moral disarmament was also brought to attention, believing that radio should benefit peace. (8th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Italy Pays Attention to Danube River Policy</h3>
<p>Germany Denies Papen's Visit to Rome</p>
<p>Rome: All circles here are paying close attention to Italy's Danube River policy. However, rumors about political unrest have not ceased. As for the results of the future meeting between Italy, Hungary, and Austria, it is said that the tripartite meeting will only discuss economic issues. Even if political issues are involved, they will only concern the economic construction of the Danube River basin. It is heard that the negotiations will be based on Italy's proposal from last year. This proposal not only concerns the economic cooperation of the three countries but also extends to other countries along the Danube River. Therefore, outside speculations and opposing rumors are overly concerned. (9th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Berlin) There were rumors that German Deputy Chancellor Papen would visit Italy when the Austrian and Hungarian Prime Ministers negotiated with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in Rome, in order to consult with Austrian Prime Minister Dollfuss. Today, the government issued a formal statement denying this. The reason is that Papen has recently been feeling unwell and his duties are heavy. Papen is currently ill at home. This afternoon, Prime Minister Hitler personally visited him. (8th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Today, Foreign Secretary Simon received German Ambassador Hoesch. Hoesch will return to his country soon. Today, Simon informed him of the situation of the disarmament negotiations. Responsible individuals here confirm that the Foreign Secretary did not offer any new suggestions to Hoesch. (8th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>London dispatch: According to reports here, Austrian Prime Minister Dollfuss and the Hungarian Prime Minister will travel to Italy together. Rome has expressed its welcome. Roman newspapers generally expect a tripartite agreement between Italy, Austria, and Hungary, and praise Mussolini's intention to consolidate the foundation of peace in the Balkans. However, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia have expressed alarm at the visit of the Austrian and Hungarian Prime Ministers to Italy, and expressed that they would rather see the National Socialist Party gain power in Austria. Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia naturally oppose the alliance of countries advocating the revision of the Treaty of Trianon, as the two countries were the main beneficiaries of the treaty, while Hungary lost a significant amount of territory, and the provision that its independence should be maintained without the consent of the League of Nations. Furthermore, the alliance of Italy, Austria, and Hungary is rooted in the attempt to curb Germany's ambitions in Austria and Central Europe, so Germany also opposes it.</p>
<p>At the same time, Austrian Prime Minister Dollfuss is striving to realize the ideal of a Christian corporate state and celebrated the one-week anniversary of the dissolution of the Austrian Parliament yesterday (4th). In Corinthia, Dollfuss told 25,000 farmers that Austria's new constitution will be promulgated in the near future. Dollfuss also praised the workers, because Austrian workers who were loyal to the government accounted for 90% during the recent Social Democratic uprising. Dollfuss also stated that Austria is prepared to establish reciprocal tariffs with Hungary, but without establishing a customs union. We have obtained the foundation of Austria's welfare. Austria is now able to be self-reliant and does not need to rely on others.</p>
<p>Here and in various cities in Europe, there is much speculation about whether Dollfuss can overcome his key subordinates, such as Deputy Prime Minister Emil Fey and Internal Guard Commander Prince Starhemberg. It is known that Dollfuss opposes severely punishing Social Democratic members arrested in recent disturbances, while Fey and Prince Starhemberg advocate severe punishment. The Austrian Social Democratic Party anticipates a large increase in National Socialist Party members. However, many Austrian workers fear the retaliatory actions of the National Socialist Party. The Austrian and Hungarian Prime Ministers will arrive in Rome around March 12. The main purpose of the Austrian and Hungarian Prime Ministers' visit to Italy has been officially announced, which is to discuss with Mussolini the plan for the economic methods of the Danube River countries proposed by Mussolini. However, as a result of the consultation between the three Prime Ministers of Italy, Austria, and Hungary, Italy may be able to support the restoration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. This step will inevitably be opposed, because the restoration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire must be accompanied by the requirement to build defensive fortifications on the Austro-Hungarian border.

<h3>Hitler Commits Crime of Destroying Civilization</h3>
<p>New Yorkers Make a Joke</p>
<p>German Ambassador's Protest Ineffective</p>
<p>(New York) A mock trial was held in Madison Avenue Park, New York, last night, with German Prime Minister Hitler as the defendant. Many lawyers participated in this mock trial, and there were many spectators. The lawsuit was conducted in a solemn and humorous manner. There were twenty prosecutors, including the current Mayor of New York, LaGuardia, and the former Mayor, Smith. As a result, Hitler was convicted of the crime of destroying civilization. When the verdict was announced, the crowd applauded for a long time. German Ambassador to the United States, Dr. Luther, protested to the White House today because of this incident, accusing it of insulting the German nation and its Prime Minister, and requested that the responsible person be punished. This matter has now been handed over to the State Department for handling. It is heard that the State Department has replied, stating that government personnel did not participate in this mock trial, so the government cannot take any action. (8th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Austrian Cabinet to Be Reorganized</h3>
<p>Fascist Leader Vies for Power with Prime Minister</p>
<p>Internal Guard Under Dollfuss' Command</p>
<p>Vienna: The result of the power struggle between Austrian Prime Minister Dollfuss and Internal Guard Commander Prince Starhemberg, which will lead to a major reorganization of the current cabinet, has not been officially announced, but the extent of its progress has indeed become clearer day by day. Roughly, the leader of the Farmers' League, former Interior Minister Bachingji, will still join the cabinet as Interior Minister. Dollfuss has concurrently served as Interior Minister for a long time, and this time he will have to give in. As for Starhemberg's private army, the Internal Guard, it will be under Dollfuss' command from now on, while Starhemberg will join the cabinet as a minister without portfolio. The current Propaganda Committee will be reorganized into a department. (8th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Vienna: The Farmers' League has not intervened in national affairs since last autumn, when a conflict occurred between former Deputy Prime Minister Winkler's professional group front and Prime Minister Dollfuss' patriotic front. However, the Farmers' League is now actively participating in political life again in order to obtain some status. Former Governor of Carinthia, Keirme, who was related to the National Socialist Party, has resigned and will be succeeded by General Hergerd, the leader of the patriotic league in the province. This move has opened a new situation, because the Farmers' League wants to completely break away from the National Socialist Party and reunite with the government party. It has already shown its aspirations. It is heard that the Farmers' League is currently considering declaring its dissolution on its own in the near future and joining the patriotic front. Therefore, political news insiders all believe that this move will cause a problem, that is, the Farmers' League may rejoin the cabinet and recommend a candidate for cabinet member. In addition, the cabinet may be reorganized before Dollfuss departs for Rome on the 13th of this month. Rumors are rife. (9th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Spain Under National Martial Law</h3>
<p>Revolution Still Brewing</p>
<p>Left and Right Wingers Shoot at Each Other</p>

<h3>US Congress Supports Roosevelt</h3>
<p>Grants Power to Increase or Decrease Tariffs</p>
<p>Consideration of War Debt Problem</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt and Democratic leaders met at the White House today. The leaders promised to find ways to pass the various bills that have been submitted and not resolved before Congress adjourns in mid-May, especially focusing on the tariff plan, which will allow the President to increase or decrease tariffs, as a preliminary step in considering the war debt problem. Senator Robinson said today that President Roosevelt's war debt message to Congress will be purely informative in nature and will not require legislative procedures. The issue of the United States joining the International Court of Justice will be shelved indefinitely. (9th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull presented a draft law to the House Ways and Means Committee, requesting that President Roosevelt be granted full power to amend tariffs. In his speech, Hull said that this draft law is extremely important, because if we want to restore international trade and make it practically possible, the only feasible policy is to conclude commercial treaties separately with various countries. Trade wars benefit no one. Various restrictions on international trade are bound to cause serious disputes and even provoke wars. As a result of international trade wars, when goods cannot circulate, phenomena such as overproduction, unemployment, and capital outflow are bound to follow. Conversely, if international trade can develop according to normal conditions, the total amount of international trade in the world can be increased from the current 1.3 million US dollars to 5 million US dollars. The purpose of the bill recently submitted by the government to the House is to restore trade relations between countries, so that our country and other countries can benefit from it. We deeply hope to reopen the old markets that have been closed and at the same time find new markets for selling goods. As for the most-favored-nation treatment clause, it will still be maintained. In conclusion, Hull said that the bill proposed by the government is based on the common benefit of all countries to restore international trade, so this bill is not only sufficient to assist the economic recovery of the world, but also a powerful element of peace and culture.

<h3>UK-Japan Cotton Industry Problem Temporarily Handled by Governments</h3>
<p>(London) The fifth meeting of the British-Japanese Chamber of Commerce opened at 10:30 am on the 8th at the British Ministry of Commerce.

The British representatives agreed to this and decided to resume the meeting on the 14th. The meeting was adjourned after only twenty minutes. However, because the claims of the delegations of the two countries are still opposed, whether the consultation will break down depends on the activities of the British and Japanese governments this week and the extent of the delegation's concessions. The content of the new memorandum submitted by Lancashire cannot be known because the delegations of the two countries are strictly confidential.

That is, Minister of Colonial Affairs Nagai also answered that it was a national policy company. Yu considers the South Manchurian Railway to be a commercial company with the mission of special national policy. If the term national policy company is easy to cause confusion, it should be cautious. Its reorganization should consult the parliament and not rely on imperial orders. Even if the name of the South Manchurian Railway is reorganized, it cannot be changed. That is, its organization, in addition to the top management, should organize a deliberative council to assist the top management. Minister of Colonial Affairs Nagai expressed his support for this, saying that Yu agrees with Okura. The South Manchurian Railway is a special company with the mission of special national policy. It is not the time to change the South Manchurian Railway into a state-owned company today. Yu's intention is to still cooperate with the South Manchurian Railway today.

<h3>The Current State of the European Gold Standard (London Correspondence)</h3>
<p>The Gold Standard Inevitably Shakes</p>
<p>France Makes Every Effort to Maintain It</p>
<p>Before the World Economic Conference last year, we all knew that the tune of so-called international cooperation was sung very high, and many people had great hopes for it, thinking that even if the whole problem could not be solved, at least a superficial conclusion could be reached on the technical aspects. Unexpectedly, at the very beginning, a major upheaval occurred regarding international currency stabilization, and international cooperation was thus declared a failure, and international disputes were intensified. Britain had already abandoned the gold standard, and needless to say, the United States was also preparing to use an inflationary policy to subdue its domestic panic. Thereupon, the European countries that had suffered from inflated currencies began to unite. The countries participating in this alliance at that time were France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Poland, with the common goal of defending the gold standard to the death, forming a European economic alliance centered on France.</p>
<p>Now the United States has formally announced a reduction in the pure gold content of the US dollar, and the problem can be said to be very serious. The future of the gold standard can also be said to be very critical. However, it is a question worth our attention as to how things will change in the future. Judging from the current situation, they probably will not abandon the gold standard in the short term. The reasons are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The four economically strong countries of France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland still maintain huge amounts of cash. France has 80 billion francs, Belgium has 2.7 billion Belgas, the Netherlands has 768 million florins, and Switzerland has almost 800 million francs. Moreover, their foreign short-term investments are very small, so the flight of domestic capital abroad is not very intense. Therefore, they still have the strength to maintain the gold standard.</p>
<p>(2) Among the six countries in the gold standard alliance, four have deeply felt the pain of currency inflation. Their people strongly oppose the paper money policy. If the gold standard is stopped, the currency inflation policy will naturally follow. Then political struggles will become more intense, and riots are feared to occur. Strikes and other actions that disrupt social order cannot be ruled out. These are all experiences that the German and French countries have had in the past, and they are certainly unwilling to take risks again.</p>
<p>(3) The countries in continental Europe that have implemented currency inflation policies have not stabilized their currencies for many years, and it has not been long since they regained the credibility lost by the inflation policy. If the gold standard is stopped, they will lose credibility again. Therefore, they now want to fix the credibility of the gold standard, and conversely, they oppose adopting the suspension of the gold standard.</p>
<p>However, France has a major contradiction: First, the outflow of cash cannot be underestimated. Second, last year's visible trade deficit was nearly 1 billion francs. Third, foreign investment is gradually being recovered, and interest income will naturally decrease. Therefore, since last year, more than 6 billion francs have fled abroad. This number is indeed not to be easily overlooked. Moreover, France has worked hard to prevent the hiding of cash and increase income from ships and the like, but the world economy has not really improved, so France will certainly not be able to avoid its adverse effects. Therefore, maintaining the gold standard is not easy. On the other hand, the cash reserve ratio of the franc is still 92%, and the general middle class supports the gold standard, and the political tendency is towards a strong cabinet, then the gold standard seems to be able to continue for some time.</p>
<p>The Netherlands is considered a relatively strong country in Europe, but since last year, the import and export trade, compared with 1929, has fallen by almost one-third. In the early spring of last year, prices fell, and by winter, they were forced to increase by 5% by artificial methods, but there was no substantive improvement. The source of her livelihood is the market of the Dutch East Indies. In 1929, she ranked first in imports to the area, but by last year, this market was seized by Japanese goods. Japanese goods imported into the Dutch East Indies accounted for 56% of the total imports, squeezing the Netherlands to second place. As a result, unemployment continues to increase in the country, and both the textile industry and the coal mines are panicking. Recently, there have been proposals to ally with Britain to resist Japanese goods.</p>
<p>Belgium is considered a country that can maintain fiscal balance. Its cash reserve can also maintain a level of more than 2.6 billion Belgas, which is a country that supports the gold standard. Besides France, Belgium is the one that matters.</p>
<p>Switzerland is the weakest link in the gold standard countries. First, there are financial difficulties. Last year, the income was insufficient by about 100 million francs. The difficulties in foreign trade are also because the watches manufactured in the country are not easy to sell, so export trade is always declining. In fact, what Switzerland relies on is the income from foreign tourists. First, because Swiss prices are higher than in any European country, and second, because the economic situation is not good, there are few tourists. The closure of Swiss hotels is now even affecting the financial turnover of banks.</p>
<p>Germany in the European gold standard countries is already in a precarious situation, and Italy is also difficult to sustain. Relying on France alone will not work. Economic insecurity will easily affect politics in the future. (February 2, 1934, London)</p>
<h3>Research on the Future of the Saito Cabinet (Japanese Correspondence)</h3>
<p>Partition by Various Parties</p>
<p>Speculation on Successors</p>
<p>The evolution of the Japanese political situation, since Mr. Okamoto's blatant questioning, has caused a huge political uproar. Although Mr. Okamoto's investigation of the Eisaku Sato bribery case has come to an end, the Saito Cabinet is not stable because of this. On the contrary, the movement of party splits has become more obvious. Hatoyama has now resigned, and the position of Minister of Education is temporarily held by Saito concurrently. The Saito Cabinet has not collapsed, but the attackers are still proceeding, and the issue of Railway Minister Mitsuchi is about to rise again, so the matter of the Saito Cabinet's resignation en masse is still being actively brewed. It probably is not without meaning to talk about the succeeding cabinet now.</p>
<p>After the Saito Cabinet, some say that Saito will be reappointed to form a cabinet, some say that the current Governor-General of Korea, Ugaki Kazushige, will succeed, some say that Hiranuma Kiichirō will form a cabinet, and there are also Takahashi Korekiyo, Konoe Fumimaro, and Ichiki Kitokurō who may be appointed to form a cabinet.</p>
<p>The reason why Saito Makoto has been able to maintain it until now is that he is a veteran of the navy and has a good reputation among the military. Secondly, he is very generous and can indeed accommodate and reconcile between the army and the navy. He also does not excessively destroy constitutional politics and still maintains the face of parliamentary politics. He is also not very harsh on capitalists. Therefore, in the turbulent political tide, he can always manage to get through it.</p>
<p>The most promising candidate is Ugaki Kazushige. He is the first person after Tanaka Giichi among the elders of the Japanese military. He has almost formed the Okayama faction himself, and most of the general class support him. He also has a good relationship with the Minseitō party, and the deputies under the Minseitō are also willing to support him. However, the staff officer class under the military丨丨i.e., colonels, lieutenant colonels, and majors, which the Japanese call the core class丨丨are very dissatisfied with him. The reason for their dissatisfaction is that first, Ugaki is close to the political parties and does not follow the ways of the military clique. Second, Ugaki advocates preserving parliamentary politics, which is very inconvenient for the military dictatorship movement. Therefore, the core class would rather support Araki or Masaki than Ugaki. Then, even if the Minseitō party enthusiastically supports him, the result will still be unable to take the stage, because the real power of the Japanese military is almost in the hands of the core class. If the core class opposes it, there will inevitably be more difficulties in politics. It is now unknown whether the people in the core class can change their attitude.</p>
<p>The next most promising figure is Hiranuma Kiichirō, who is known to the world. The center of the Hiranuma cabinet-formation movement is the Kokuhonsha and various right-wing groups related to the Kokuhonsha. Hayashi Senjūrō in the army and Katō Kanji in the navy have both expressed their goodwill towards him. The Satsuma faction in Kazuyama Sukehide (member of the House of Peers) also emphasized advocating the so-called Hiranumaism to help Hiranuma, but Hiranumaism has been advocated for so long, but it still cannot take the stage. The reason is that his relationship with the elder statesmen is not good, especially those who advocate the theory of constitutional common sense, such as Kinmochi Saionji, are even worse towards him, but Interior Minister Nobuaki Makino has a fairly good feeling towards Hiranuma. Among the people in the House of Representatives, some members of the Kokumin Domei led by Nakanō Seigō are also expressing goodwill towards Hiranuma, and even some members of the Tokuji faction are willing to support Hiranuma. After the internal strife in the Seiyūkai party this time, the Kūhara Fusanosuke stream also communicated with Hiranuma, so the optimistic theory of Hiranuma's cabinet formation has gradually risen again recently.</p>
<p>Again, the most popular and politically skilled among the nobles is Konoe Fumimaro. According to the current situation, if Konoe organizes a transcendent cabinet, there will be no problems in both houses. However, the elder statesmen believe that Konoe is indeed talented and can be greatly used, but in the current chaotic situation, it seems unnecessary to sacrifice him, so the feasibility of Konoe's cabinet is not very high now.</p>
<p>Ichiki Kitokurō is also a suitable prime minister in the Japanese political world, but because of the London Treaty issue, his opinions with the military have not yet been satisfactory. At this time, the military supports everything, and it is therefore even more difficult for Ichiki to form a cabinet.</p>
<p>As for the Kiyoura Keigo Cabinet, it is essentially very similar to Saito. It is even less the time for Araki to form a cabinet now. It is even less likely that Suzuki Saburō, Wakatsuki Reijirō, and others will take the stage as party leaders. (March 1, 1934, Tokyo)</p>
<h3>Sun Dianying's Troops are Reorganized by Jin Fang</h3>
<p>Fu Zhan Kui Agrees to Meet Sun at Dengkou</p>
<p>Lu Fengnian Suggests Sun's Troops Surrender to Jin Fang</p>
<p>Beijing Correspondence: The Sun Dianying incident, as of now, is still being resolved more by military means. Fu Zhan Kui is currently staying at Huangyangmutou and has telegraphed Sun Dianying, agreeing to meet Sun at Dengkou, but Sun has not replied. Because there is news that the Jin army is advancing toward Dengkou in the near future. As for Lu Fengnian of Sun's troops in Dengkou, he sent a representative, Yu Muxing, to Beijing the other day to meet with He Yingqin, expressing that he could urge Sun to leave the army, but hoped that his troops would be reorganized by Jin Fang. This morning (8th), according to the spokesman of the Military Sub-Committee, the authorities' method for Sun's troops has always remained unchanged from the original proposal. If Sun Dianying can be made to leave the army, Sun's troops will be withdrawn to their original defense, and downsized according to the number on file in accordance with the order of the Military Sub-Committee, then it is not impossible for Jin Fang to reorganize the troops. It is reported that Yu Muxing will stay in Beijing for about three days before leaving Beijing.</p>
<p>Since Fu Zuoyi returned to Suiyuan, the military operations have become more urgent. The rear troops left in Suiyuan have all moved westward, with the majority of troops advancing towards Dengkou, and before Fu Zhan Kui and Sun Dianying's negotiations have yielded results, Sun's troops will be subjected to the greatest threat, in order to make the troops submit. All personnel of Fu Zuoyi's military headquarters have arrived in Baotou. After the eastern Suiyuan troops moved westward, the defense was filled in by the Zhou Yuanjian Brigade of Li Fuying's troops. As for the Xu Zizhen Regiment of the 70th Division of the Wang Jingguo troops, which was responsible for the vanguard, it did have contact with more than 1,000 cavalrymen of the Peng Zhen Brigade of Sun's army. The Peng Brigade could not support it and retreated westward. The Xu Regiment then occupied the area. This was the first conflict between the Jin Sui army and Sun's troops. After the Xu Regiment made some adjustments, it also cooperated with the cavalry of Zhao Chengshou's troops and the 205th and 215th Brigades to actively advance westward according to the original plan. When they arrived near the Huangtulahai River, they found more than 1,000 of Sun's troops resisting and defending. After the Jin Sui army once carried out a fierce artillery bombardment, Sun's troops were again unable to support it and fled in the southwest direction. The Jin Sui army tracked and chased fiercely. This was the second conflict. The vanguard of the current Jin Sui army has been forced to Dengkou, confronting the Lu Fengnian troops of Sun's 119th Division. If Sun's meeting with Fu Zhan Kui still yields no results, the Jin Sui army will attack Dengkou. It is reported that Sun himself has expressed to people that he is willing to leave the army and downsize his troops in accordance with the order, but he still strongly advocates the realization of the matter of the troops going to Qinghai to cultivate wasteland, so that they can have a way out. Sun's division commander, Lu Fengnian, has suggested to Sun that Sun's entire jurisdiction should be handed over to Jin Fang for reorganization, so as to avoid scattering. Sun also expressed sympathy for this. When Sun leaves the army in the future, he may hand over the entire command to Lu for reorganization and surrender to Jin Fang. Moreover, Lu Fengnian and Sun are from the same hometown. More than ten years ago, he served as a division commander in the Jin army. Last year, he was appointed by Sun as the division commander of the 119th Division of the army and also has a good feeling for Jin Fang.</p>
<p>A certain member of the Military Sub-Committee in Beijing talked about how Fu Zhankui, who went to Dengkou to meet Sun Zhanying, had arrived at Huangyangmutou and was heading towards Dengkou. Sun Zhanying was indeed in the Mandahai area near Ningyuan, but Sun had ordered his troops to inform Li Ming, the staff officer of the Military Sub-Committee who arrived in Dengkou, that he would return to Dengkou to meet Fu. Regardless of whether Sun accepts the advice to leave the army, it is expected that if the two men of Fu and Sun can meet, there will be progress. The military authorities, because Sun's attitude is uncertain and there is no considerable certainty of a peaceful solution, have always actively carried out military preparations. The war situation in the Ningyuan area is not as serious as rumored. There have only been small contacts between the two sides. The Military Sub-Committee has already decided on the steps for the Sun issue yesterday, but it depends on how the results of Fu Zhankui's meeting with Sun are before implementing the established plan.

<h3>The Reason for Du Qiyun's Execution in Beijing</h3>
<p>The Crime of Colluding with Ronin</p>
<p>Conspiring to Overthrow the Government</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: When the Central Army entered Fujian to suppress the rebellion, Du Qiyun was ordered to be the Fujian Military Commissioner. After the military ended, Du flew from Xiamen to the provincial capital on February 1. On the same day, he was detained by Provincial Chairman Chen Yi upon receiving a telegram order from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. On the 8th, Chiang sent someone from Fujian to escort him to Nanjing. After that, the news was silent. Recently, it has been widely rumored in Xiamen that he was executed in Beijing. Du's relatives and friends in Xiamen telegraphed Beijing to inquire about Du's relatives, and received a reply stating that "Du died of a sudden illness." Therefore, Du's death was confirmed. Yesterday, political circles here received the news that Du was shot on February 28. The so-called sudden death from a sudden illness was actually execution. His crimes were "colluding with ronin, organizing institutions, and conspiring to overthrow the government." It turns out that after Du recovered Xiamen, he set up a military commissioner's office in Xiamen. During this period, Du actually colluded with ronin from a certain side to organize the South China State. More than 40 people had already signed the petition, and Du was elected as the leader. Someone reported the incident to Chiang Kai-shek, and a certain side searched for important documents, including the signing register at the time, and submitted them to Beijing. Chiang Kai-shek immediately ordered Du to be detained and escorted to Beijing for questioning. In addition to the strong physical evidence, there were also important personnel from Fujian who went to Beijing to testify. Therefore, Du was sentenced to death. Due to certain relations, it was announced to the outside world that he died suddenly. According to Du, whose name is Jinzhai, he is from Hubei. He served as a soldier in western Fujian for many years. He was first the subordinate of Wang Xianchen, and then rose to the brigade commander of the 3rd Division of Li Fengxiang. In 15 years of the Republic of China, during the battle of the Party Army entering Fujian, Du led his brigade and Cao Wanshun's brigade to revolt, causing Zhou Yinren's elite troops to be completely lost. The Party Army was able to recover Xiamen, and it was not without slight effort. Unexpectedly, he died of colluding with ronin, organizing institutions, and conspiring to overthrow the government.

<h3>Special Taxes are Opened in Fujian Province</h3>
<p>Tax Revenues are Used to Fund Bandit Suppression and Revitalize the Countryside</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Regarding the opening of special taxes in this province, the authorities have been planning for a long time, and it was only recently established. The name is the驻闽办事处 (Zhu Min Ban Shi Chu) Fujian Office, with the head of the office being She Tian, and the deputy head being Gao Guangqian. The office is located in Yijiangfan, Fuzhou. Its implementation plan starts with Fuzhou and Xiamen.

The following are the five articles of the brief chapter that were promulgated yesterday: (1) Merchants in various counties who have accumulated unsold special goods, regardless of the quantity, shall report the types, quantities, and quantities of the inventory to the office for verification and registration within ten days from the date of the announcement of the verification. (2) After the office reports the quantity of unsold goods, it will send personnel to investigate and affix labels. (3) If the report is not made within the deadline, or if the report is made with more reports and less reports, once it is found out, in addition to confiscating the goods, all those who conceal and sell the goods will be severely punished according to military law. (4) In the future, special goods that must be affixed with verification labels will be allowed to be sold. (5) This brief chapter will be announced and implemented from the date of approval by the Provincial Government. It is heard that the special goods accumulated in this province can be sold for at least three years, so it does not interfere with the policy of prohibiting the planting of opium seedlings. As for the tax revenue, half of it is used to fund the bandit suppression, so as to quell the Red Disaster, and half is used to run the Farmers' Bank, so as to seek to revitalize the countryside. It is different from the previous forced planting of opium seedlings and forced collection of donations. However, the people who operate this special goods business in Fuzhou and Xiamen are all Taiwanese citizens and are not subject to Chinese law. Government offices have never had the right to intervene. If taxes are suddenly levied on these people without contact, conflicts will inevitably arise. During the era of the pseudo-People's Government, the guards of the Smoking Ban Supervision Office were killed on the street due to conflicts with Taiwanese people. After the incident, there was no way to negotiate. Therefore, the Special Tax Office is now in contact with Taiwanese people, allowing Taiwanese people to open foreign firms in Fuzhou and Xiamen to sell special goods, but they must pay taxes and affix certificates upon import in accordance with the regulations.

<h3>Tragic Shipwreck in Yue River</h3>
<p>Electric Boat Overturns in Sihui</p>
<p>More Than Two Hundred Passengers Killed</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: In the Zhujiang River basin of Guangdong Province, there are many ports and forks, and transportation in all counties is by waterway. Therefore, the embankments and river crossings in the provincial capital are crowded. In the past, ferries in various villages mostly used small steamships for transportation. Recently, they have mostly switched to electric boats, because electric boats are twice as fast as ferries. The electric boats are constructed with a flat bottom and shallow draft. Although they travel fast, they are not as safe as ferries. Recently, the newly installed electric boat Sihai, which runs between Guangzhou and Sihui County, has a very prosperous business. Passengers benefit from its fast round trip and are happy to take it. On the morning of the 4th of this month, the Sihai electric boat carried 450 passengers from Sihui County to the province. After the ship had been traveling for more than ten hours, at about 5:00 in the evening, when it sailed to the river surface of the Shitou Da Chongkou in the south of the province, just as it was about to reach Guangzhou, the bottom of the boat suddenly hit a reef and pierced a hole. River water poured in, and the people on the boat screamed for help and squeezed each other. The ship tilted, and after a while, it overturned. The cries shook the sky. Only those who knew how to swim escaped for their lives. The rest were drowned. The boatmen nearby heard the warning and rushed to rescue them in their boats. The patrol boat of the South Shitou Water Police Station, the water rescue team, and the civilian boats of the Fangbian Hospital also arrived after hearing the news to try to rescue them. More than 60 passengers drifting on the river surface were rescued, and another 20 were rescued in various ways. A total of 80 or 90 people were rescued. At the same time, more than 90 bodies were recovered. The rescue team of Fangbian Hospital also recovered four batches of bodies, the first batch of 45 male bodies and 12 female bodies, the second batch of 52 male and female bodies, the third batch of 57 bodies, and the fourth batch of more than 20 bodies. As of the afternoon of the 5th, the search was still in progress. It is estimated that 167 male and female passengers have been drowned. The remaining number of those trapped in the boat has not yet been determined. The bodies were transported to the former Yigang of Fangbian Hospital by freight car for numbering and photographing to await identification by the relatives of the deceased. Only more than 30 of them are known by name. The rest are unknown and have no relatives to claim them. The bodies will be coffined and buried in the Wuzhagang Cemetery of Yidi by the Fangbian Hospital at 2 pm on the 6th. As for the more than 80 survivors who were rescued, most of them have returned home by themselves or sought refuge with relatives. Among them, there are still 14 people who have no relatives to rely on in the province and are temporarily taken in by Fangbian Hospital to provide assistance for their return to Sihui and Guangning, their places of origin. It was also found that the 32 sailors of the electric boat were fortunate enough to swim and escape. As for the seven or eight accountants and staff members on the boat, they have all been drowned.

<h3>Anhui's People's Wealth and Two Offices Rectify Autumn Grain Collection</h3>
<p>Draft Measures for Various Counties to Investigate and Report Disasters</p>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: In Anhui Province, the handling of autumn grain collection in previous years has been fraught with abuses. Among the 61 counties in the province, only 14 counties, including Lian County, Xiuning, Wuyuan, Qimen, Yi County, Jixi, Jing County, Ningguo, Jingde, Taiping, Shidai, Guangde, Liu'an and Shan, have never handled disasters. And 9 counties, including Xuancheng, Nanling, Wuhu, Langxi, Shucheng, Mengcheng, Taihe, Woyang, and Chu County, do not request investigation even if they have not actually suffered a disaster. All land taxes are collected in full according to the amount. More than 30 counties, including Huaining, report disasters and request investigation whenever there is occasional maladjustment of rain and sunshine. This long-standing habit is unbreakable. In previous autumn grain collections, the determination of the number of mature collections must be repeatedly ordered to be rejected and returned several times before a decision can be made. As a result, the reduction or delay of the annual land tax to be collected is more than 600,000 yuan. In years with serious disasters, it is more than this. This reduction or delay of land tax in counties that break the string to offset collection (such as Huaining, Taihu, Guichi, and Zhizhi counties, there is no such corruption), the rest mostly do not distinguish between disasters and maturity, and collect in general. For example, if the tax amount is 100,000 yuan, and the autumn harvest is determined to be 80%, officials are also collected. For flower households, regardless of whether they have been affected by the disaster or not, they are still collected according to 100%. After collecting 80,000 yuan, the rest is treated as a disaster relief and stopped. As a result, the real disaster households still pay 100% of the grain silver, and cunning people delay and resist payment, waiting to escape. And the abuses such as clerks selling disasters and reducing discounts for private collection also arise because of this. Recently, the two offices of the People's Livelihood and Finance have specially drafted measures for various counties to investigate and report disasters based on the regulations on investigating and reporting disasters promulgated by the Central Government, and submitted them to the recent provincial government standing committee for approval. The original text is as follows: Article 1. When there are disasters such as floods, droughts, typhoons, hailstorms, and insect damage in various counties of this province, in addition to the regulations on investigating and reporting disasters, the provisions of this method shall be followed. Article 2. When disasters occur in various places, such as drought and insect disasters, the county magistrate shall personally visit the site for investigation and immediately report it to the Department of Civil Affairs and the Department of Finance within 10 days. In the case of typhoons, hailstorms, floods, and other urgent disasters, the report shall be made within 3 days. The committee members will be sent to the county for re-investigation and reported for approval. The deadline for summer disasters is the day before the beginning of autumn, and the deadline for autumn disasters is the day before the beginning of the science. Those who report after the deadline will not be investigated. Article 3. After the county magistrate and the committee members have re-investigated, they shall calculate the number of land taxes that should be exempted or delayed according to the severity of the disaster and the limits of exemption and delay stipulated in the regulations on investigating and reporting disasters. They shall prepare a list of districts, villages, land areas, household names, and tax numbers, draw a picture, affix a statement, and add a conclusion, and submit it separately for approval. Article 4. If the land tax to be paid in the disaster area is not exempted or delayed in full, the number of percent actually collected shall be added to the grain string according to the number of percent determined by the investigation, and the number of percent of exemption or delay shall be marked, and collected by percentage. Article 5. The land tax for land without disasters shall still be collected in full according to the amount, and shall not be combined with the disaster land to reduce the percentage. Article 6. If the people report the disaster falsely, they shall be investigated and dealt with after the county finds out the truth. The county magistrate who fabricates the disaster situation and accepts illicit regulations shall be dismissed from office and punished. Article 7. The committee members shall personally visit the disaster area to investigate each mu of land for investigation. If they support the fabrication of reports and accept illicit regulations, they shall be severely punished according to law. Article 8. After this method is promulgated, the evil habit of collecting in general without distinguishing between disasters and maturity shall be eliminated. If there are unscrupulous officials, gentry, or scholars who hold back and obstruct, they shall be dismissed, punished, or arrested separately. Article 9. If there are any matters not covered by this method, they may be submitted for amendment at any time. Article 10. This method shall be promulgated and implemented after being resolved by the provincial government meeting. (March 7)</p>
<h3>Execution by Firing Squad of Gu Zixiang, Notorious Bandit of Nanhui</h3>
<p>Gu Zixiang, a ringleader of bandits from Datuan, together with his gang, armed and robbed two families, Tan Pingqi and Tan Houxiang, in Pengshou Township, District 9, in April of the year before last. He also shot and wounded the victims. After the county government apprehended the culprit, he was repeatedly interrogated, and his confessions were found to be conclusive. He was sentenced to death and the sentence was approved by the provincial government. Yesterday at 4 PM, he was brought to the court for identification. After confirming his identity, he was escorted to the execution grounds outside Nanmen (South Gate) and executed by firing squad. It is said that the culprit had many accomplices. Recently, Lin Zhengfeng and others, who were arrested and sent to the province for falsely reporting the discovery of a large quantity of military supplies on the coast, were close friends of the culprit. The previous time Lin and others accompanied Xi Zhonghong, the chief of the first section of the fourth division of the provincial government, to Nanhui to investigate the case, they visited the prison to see Gu Zixiang, intending to find a way to rescue him. Fortunately, County Magistrate Yuan discovered this early and did not fall for Lin's treacherous scheme.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Residents Tao Boye and Others Initiate a Factory to Manufacture Cigarette Rolling Paper</h3>
<p>In recent years, observing the vast and increasing financial drain caused by cigarette smoking in society, Chinese people have started setting up factories to manufacture cigarettes themselves. However, the rolling paper used for cigarettes is still imported. Therefore, Suzhou residents Tao Boye and others have initiated a factory to manufacture it themselves by raising funds. The planned capital is one million yuan. After repeated meetings and discussions, progress has been made recently. In addition to many participants from Fujian, many Shanghai cigarette factories have also joined as shareholders. The factory site is located near Fengqiao in Suzhou, because the water there is very clear and has been tested to produce good, clean, and white paper. When the factory opens, the number of workers will be at least 300, half men and half women.</p>
<h3>Luguang Township Robbery Case</h3>
<p>More than ten bandits broke into the house of Sheng Zenghu, a resident of Huajiaqiao Township, Luguang, the night before last, and committed robbery. Sheng woke up from his dream and immediately fled. The bandits spotted him, chased him, and shot him in the head when they could not catch him. Then, they captured him, beat him with ropes, and burned him all over with fire. Subsequently, they robbed him of clothing, silver dollars, and other items, worth about one hundred yuan.</p>
<h3>Songjiang Second District Boy Scout Leadership Conference</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Province Second District Boy Scout Leadership Conference, including leaders from twelve counties such as Songjiang, Shanghai, Nanhui, Fengxian, Chuansha, Baoshan, Qingpu, Jinshan, Jiading, Taicang, Chongming, Qidong, Haimen, and Nantong Rugao, is being held in the auditorium of the Songjiang County Party Headquarters for two days starting today (the 9th). More than 20 leaders from various counties are attending.

Various counties presented several important cases, all concerning the progress of Boy Scouts within the district.</p>
<h3>Alarming Rumors About Power Outage</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Electric Company suddenly announced today that due to damage to the small chimney in the boiler, power supply would be suspended for seven days starting today. Upon receiving the news, citizens were alarmed. Since the power was normally cut off last night, how could they know in advance that the small chimney was damaged? And why were both the large and small machines damaged at the same time? Why would repairs take as long as seven days? People were shocked and suspicious. Li Zuhua, the district head of the First District, was also deeply dissatisfied because the current winter defense had not yet ended, and local security was related to bandits. Without prior approval from the competent authorities, they rashly cut off the power. Moreover, it was during a dark night. In addition to sending an assistant to inspect the company and sending a letter warning them to shorten the repair time, he also informed the public security authorities that during the power outage, special attention must be paid to local security. The County Chamber of Commerce also sent a letter to the company, urging them to complete the repairs and restore power as soon as possible to maintain security. It is unknown how the company will handle this. Local people are saying that the power outage was announced when the new and old managers of the company were in dispute, with some suspecting that it was a prearranged step. Whether this is true remains to be verified.</p>
<h3>A Baffling Swindle in Wuxi</h3>
<p>On the morning of the 3rd, a man named Rong Zhongjing from Shanghai arrived at the Huashang Hotel on Tongyun Road outside Guangfu Gate. He was dressed in a Western suit and claimed to be the director of the Beijing engineering project for the Xin Cheng Ji Construction Company in Shanghai. He said that he had come to Wuxi under the commission of the main factory to contract for the rice flour company and also produce pickles, with a capital of 1.5 million yuan. The site had already been surveyed at Jie Jingqiao, outside Nanmen, and the construction cost was estimated at 150,000 yuan. After booking Room 22 at the hotel, he went around contacting various businesses. Later, Zhang Juexian, the owner of the Gongda Brick Factory on Jiaoji Road, and Gong Yaomao, the owner of the Shunxiangxing Sheet Metal Shop, learned about it and went to contact him for business. Rong claimed to Zhang and Gong that the company would need a total of 2.2 million bricks and 7,000 to 8,000 yuan worth of sheet metal, and asked if they could sell them at wholesale prices. Zhang and Gong were overjoyed at the prospect of such a large business and invited him to Taiheyuan for a banquet to promote business. The next day, Rong also went to the Taisan brand cement company on Liangxi Road to contact manager Sun Baoshun, and told the company's director Yang Zhongzi that he was currently applying for a construction permit from the Wuxi County Construction Bureau, which required 150 yuan, and he was short a few dozen yuan. Yang, also for business reasons, lent him 20 yuan. Afterwards, Rong contacted several bamboo shops such as Yu Yongfeng Bamboo Shop in Zhuchang Lane. However, yesterday Rong suddenly disappeared without saying goodbye, and his whereabouts were unknown. The various shops then realized that they had been swindled and are now searching for him to negotiate.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over Bean Transactions Resolved</h3>
<p>The Bengbu Grain Transportation and other public associations, opposing the change in bean transactions between Wuxi and Liang Counties, sent representatives led by Li Peisheng to Wuxi for negotiations. The details of the situation have been reported in this newspaper. At 3 PM on the 8th, the County Chamber of Commerce specially convened relevant parties from the three counties of Bengbu, Wuxi, and Liang to attempt mediation. More than twenty people including Sun Yuanfu attended. Qian Sunqing, a standing committee member of the Wuxi Chamber of Commerce, served as the temporary chairman. First, representatives from both sides expressed their opinions, with each side sticking to their own arguments. Subsequently, through the efforts of Qian Sunqing and Chen Zhanru of the Wuxi Chamber of Commerce, and Lin Junbao of the Wujin Chamber of Commerce, a resolution was finally reached. The agreed-upon principles of mediation are as follows: For soybean transactions in Wuxi and Liang, the Bengbu commission deduction method should be followed. If the price rises above five yuan, a 99% exchange rate should be used. However, since the current market price is below five yuan, the established 98.4% exchange rate in Wuxi and Liang should be revised to 96% to respect the wishes of the Bengbu merchants, limited to the north-south river beans of Bengbu, and implemented from the 10th of this month, in order to maintain mutual interests and ensure the stability of each business. After these principles were decided, representatives from the three counties of Bengbu, Wuxi, and Liang unanimously agreed and signed the original text of the principles. The meeting adjourned at around 9 PM. The three Bengbu representatives then hosted a banquet at the New World Western Restaurant for the committee members of the Wuxi and Wujin Chambers of Commerce, representatives of the rice and bean industry, and reporters from local newspapers. The guests and hosts mingled and celebrated until 11 PM before dispersing. It is also heard that the three Bengbu representatives and the Wujin representative left Wuxi yesterday to return to Bengbu.</p>
<h3>Government Car Derails While Turning</h3>
<p>In order to improve railway operations and ensure passenger safety, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau specially dispatched the chief engineer, a foreigner named Bai Huaide, to inspect the route. Bai arrived in Wuxi on the 8th on the 12:00 express train from Shanghai to Beijing, staying in Government Car No. 3. Yesterday morning at 9 AM, station master Li Jiasheng accompanied Bai to inspect railway administration, intending to return to Shanghai on the same train at 2:38 PM in the afternoon. At 10:20 AM, the No. 3 Government Car was pushed onto the turntable by mechanics in order to turn it around and attach it to the passenger train heading to Shanghai. The car only rotated halfway on the turntable. Unexpectedly, the brakes on the car were not properly applied, and the wheel still moved forward. Although the mechanics tried to stop it, it was too late, and the car derailed. Fortunately, it was stopped by the old pump house at that location, preventing the entire car from derailing. Later, station master Li ordered workers to lift the car, and the damage was minor. Bai then took a passenger train to inspect stations such as Shitangwan.</p>
<h3>Three Changzhou School Inspectors Arrive in Changzhou for Inspection</h3>
<p>The exchange of school inspectors among counties in Jiangsu Province has recently been implemented separately. The inspectors who arrived in Changzhou are Peng Shifang from Wuxian, Huang Yue from Liyang, and Yang Binru from Nanhui. The three inspectors have separately decided on inspection areas and departed on the 8th.

The seven schools inspected by Peng Shifang are: Juqian Street, Renfan, Dongmen, Shenyuan, Yinjiaqiao, Dongjiao Citizen, Xi Zhi, etc.</p>
<h3>Gong Atang of Jiading Commits Suicide by Swallowing Opium</h3>
<p>Gong Atang of Mengjin Township, because he relied on violence to bully people and committed all kinds of evil deeds, was known as "Ye Tang" (Wild Tang). In October of the year before last, Wang He, Gao Jiren, and others who had accumulated resentment against him, beat him severely and gouged out his eyes. His stepfather Ji Shun sued the county government. After investigation, Wang He was arrested and sentenced to fifteen years in prison. After becoming blind, Ye Tang could no longer carry out his extortion and his income decreased sharply. He felt great pain and asked someone to buy opium to commit suicide, but the person gave him a placebo and failed. On the 2nd of this month, he lost money gambling in the Mengjiangtang teahouse and became even more depressed. He hired a child to help him to Liuhe, bought six jiao worth of opium, and swallowed it all on the way home. After going to bed, he died from poisoning. It was not until the next morning when his mother called him to get up that she knew he had committed suicide. His mother believed that Ye Tang's death was caused by Gao Jiren and others gouging out his eyes, so she went to Gao's house to cry bitterly for days, causing trouble in various ways. His stepfather Ji Shun again sued the county government, asking for an investigation. The county government sent personnel to investigate and confirmed that he had committed suicide by swallowing opium. After five days, his body was finally claimed on the 8th and taken home for burial.</p>
<h3>Major Fire in Yigou Town, Gaoyou</h3>
<p>The home of Wang Gui in Henan, Yigou Town, District 3, under the jurisdiction of the county, caught fire accidentally this morning (the 7th) at 9 AM due to carelessness while preparing breakfast. At that time, a strong wind was blowing, and the fire quickly spread to the surrounding houses. Although fire brigades from various places arrived to help, the wind fueled the fire and it was difficult to extinguish. As a result, fifteen houses, including Wang Baohui's house, Yongtaiheng, Yang Hengtai's general merchandise store, and Dong's silversmith shop, were burned down, causing significant losses.</p>

<h3>Xiaoshan Changhe Town Robbery Case Solved</h3>
<p>The home of Lai Youqing, a wealthy merchant in Changhe Town, western Xiaoshan, was robbed by seven bandits on the night of the 5th.

<h3>Another Proof that Germany Denies Recognizing the Puppet Manchukuo</h3>
<p>News from Tongji University</p>
<p>Yesterday, President Weng of Tongji University stated that regarding the rumors of Germany recognizing the puppet Manchukuo, they had repeatedly collected information from various German agencies. Reports from the school stated: "A telegram from the former German Maritime Society on February 26 stated, "The rumor that the Germans have recognized Manchukuo is absolutely denied and explicitly declared that all external and inaccurate news has no basis and is obviously a rumor created by traitors intending to harm Sino-German relations." Moreover, the German Minister also made a written statement stating that Germany has absolutely no intention of recognizing Manchukuo." The students of the former Japanese school originally planned to send a telegram advising the German government. However, because the German government has clearly explained this rumor, they have also stopped sending the telegram. In short, the relationship between China and Germany has always been good. From the perspective of the news obtained by German professors, the rumor is not worth believing.</p>
<h3>The International Radio Station in Shanghai Held a Test Call with Fiji Yesterday</h3>
<p>The International Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications purchased a Marconi wireless machine that can be used for both communication and telephone calls. The bureau has been testing calls with London, Berlin, San Francisco, Manila, and other places in recent days, preparing to officially launch wireless telephone service in the future. From 7 PM to 8 PM last night, it also tested a call with Manila. According to Xu Le, the engineer and business director of the International Radio Station, the results of testing calls with England, Germany, and the United States in recent days have been very good. The sound quality received during normal times is the same as that of a telephone in this city, and it is even better when the signal is clear. Currently, they are testing which wavelength is suitable for which time. Once the results are obtained, they will be reported for implementation. However, the testing is quite time-consuming, and it is currently difficult to predict when it will end. As for the current call records, they will not be released to the public for the time being. If there is an opportunity in the future, they will seek approval from Director Wen and invite members of the press for a test call.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Banking Sector Regulates Rural Finance</h3>
<p>Rural Loan Departments Established One After Another</p>
<p>Achievements of Shanghai Banks in One Year</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: In recent years, domestic disasters have been frequent, causing cash to concentrate in urban areas, and the rural economy is gradually declining. The banking sector in Shanghai is aware of this, so it has recently engaged in regulating rural finance. For example, Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank and others have successively established rural loan departments and set up branches across the country. The achievements of the bank's rural loan department in the past year are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Regulating Rural Finance is Related to the Whole Country</h3>
<p>The main reason for the decline of the rural economy is the inability to regulate farmers' finance and the inability to sell agricultural products smoothly. The solution should be to transfer urban funds to the interior, so that rural finance can circulate. At the same time, improve the marketing system to ensure the smooth sale of agricultural products. If so, the farmers' economy will be prosperous, the purchasing power will increase, the market will prosper, and industry and commerce will develop accordingly. Therefore, regulating rural finance affects not only farmers, but the entire country. Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank and other banks in Shanghai are aware of the urgent need to regulate rural finance, so they have established rural loan departments and have set up branches in Nanjing, Zhengzhou, Changsha, and other places. They will gradually expand in the future.</p>
<h3>Various Loans Released and Recovered as Scheduled</h3>
<p>Although the bank's rural loan department was officially established in January last year, the amount of money coming in and out was very small in the first six months. The business gradually increased in August, and the amount of loans was also large. The loans issued include: 428,642 yuan for transportation and sales, 306,432 yuan for credit loans, and 287,521 yuan for warehouse loans, totaling 1,022,596 yuan. Except for the loans that have not yet reached the due date, all loans issued can be recovered as scheduled (many of them are repaid early).</p>
<h3>Major Banks Extend Loans One After Another</h3>
<p>As for the benefits obtained by the farmers in those areas, the most notable ones should be: (1) Rural finance can circulate. (2) When rural finance is tight, the interest rate for previous loans is very high, even as high as 3% to 4% per month. After the establishment of the loan department, farmers who borrow money are freed from the oppression of high interest rates. (3) Farmers often lack funds, making it difficult to start various businesses. After obtaining economic assistance, many businesses have been completed. Therefore, major banks in the city have decided to invest their real estate funds in rural finance and regulation across the country. When the farmers' economy becomes prosperous, the bank's own business will also flourish. It is heard that the Bank of Communications and the Zhejiang Industrial Bank are also planning to set up rural loan departments in various ports to enrich the farmers' economy.</p>
<h3>Current Status of the Three Major Factories Under Preparation by the Ministry of Industry</h3>
<p>Construction of the Ammonium Sulfate Factory Has Begun</p>
<p>Loan for the Paper Mill Approved by the Sino-British Board</p>
<p>Factory Site for the Machine Factory Located on Vacant Land in Wusong</p>
<p>The five major factories of steel, alcohol, paper, machinery, and ammonium sulfate, planned by the Ministry of Industry, have been prepared except for the steel and alcohol factories. The remaining three factories are now being actively pursued. The details learned are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Construction of Ammonium Sulfate Factory Begins</h3>
<p>The ammonium sulfate factory was to be jointly established with Brunner Mond &amp; Co. of the United Kingdom, Brunner Mond &amp; Co. of the State of Qu, and Aicci Co. of Germany, with a capital of 15 million yuan. However, the project was abandoned due to the harsh conditions proposed by the British and German sides. The Ministry of Industry believed that the various facilities of the factory were of great importance to the future of China's industry and national defense, so it decided to have it operated by Chinese people. The industrialist Fan Xudong contacted the Ministry of Industry to handle all the contracting procedures and decided to temporarily reduce the capital from 15 million yuan to 7 million yuan to facilitate the process. It is learned that Chen Gongbo, the Minister of Industry, submitted the detailed plan for establishing the factory to the 150th meeting of the Executive Yuan. The results of the discussion were that the exemption from taxes and fees and the reduction of transportation costs for maintaining the salt production part were approved after review. As for the issuance of 5.5 million yuan in public bonds, the Ministry of Industry was ordered to investigate the amount of shares already paid and the amount of debt owed by the factory before handling it according to law. It is also heard that after the plan of the factory was approved by the Executive Yuan, preparations were immediately carried out actively. The location of the factory was also selected at Jiadian, Pukou, Nanjing, and construction began the day before yesterday, with a deadline for completion and manufacturing within one year.</p>
<h3>Loan for the Paper Mill Approved</h3>
<p>The paper mill planned by the Ministry of Industry was originally intended to be jointly operated by the government and merchants, with a capital of 5 million yuan, of which 2 million yuan was from merchant shares, jointly subscribed by newspapers and bookstores. Xiaoxi in Qingtian County, Wenzhou, was also decided as the factory site. However, due to the decline in newspaper prices, merchants were concerned that the cost of raw materials would exceed the price of foreign paper, so they all took a wait-and-see attitude, and the project was halted. It is learned that the Ministry of Industry decided to run it solely by the government in order to implement its original intention, and submitted the entire plan of the factory to the Executive Yuan for approval. Regarding the funding for the establishment, it was decided to borrow 330,000 pounds from the Central Gengkuan (Boxer Indemnity) Commission for application. The loan has been approved by the Sino-British Board, and it is expected to be approved after review by the technical and financial committees. It is also learned that in order to expedite the process, the Ministry of Industry plans to organize a paper mill committee to plan everything in order to realize it as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Central Machine Factory Seeks Land in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Since the Central Machine Factory was planned by the Ministry of Industry, it has been mostly completed and has contacted the Central Gengkuan (Boxer Indemnity) Commission to borrow 123,200 pounds for purchasing machinery. As for the factory site, it was previously decided to be in Caoxiexia, Xiaguan, Nanjing. However, because the terrain there is low-lying and cannot be used unless the soil is filled, the land price is limited after surveying and calculating, but the earthwork project is huge, costing more than 290,000 yuan. After much consideration, it was decided to move the factory to Shanghai, where industry is more developed, so that the products can be sold easily in the future. It is learned that the Ministry of Industry has selected a vacant land of about 50 acres in the southeast of Wusong Town. The land and water transportation there are very convenient. The evaluation and purchase procedures are currently underway, so that construction can begin in the near future.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications, Navy, Finance, and General Staff Departments Hold Water Drawing Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Results of Discussion Difficult to Publish for the Time Being</p>
<p>Xin Sheng She reports that the right to draw water in our country has long been controlled by foreigners. Although negotiations have been made to recover the right and Chinese people have been successively appointed as pilots, foreign pilots have not been completely dismissed and are still being employed. The Ministry of Communications and other departments, in view of the intangible loss of sovereignty, specially convened a water drawing meeting at the Jianghai Customs yesterday afternoon. Xu Jixiang, the director of the Naval Administration Department of the Navy, Gao Tingzi, the director of the Shipping Administration Department of the Ministry of Communications, and representatives from the General Staff Department and the Ministry of Finance came to Shanghai to attend the meeting to discuss gradually reducing the number of foreign water drawing personnel and examining and employing Chinese people to take over, so as to actually achieve the complete recovery of the right. Gao Tingzi, the Director of the Shipping Administration Department, told the Xin Sheng She reporter that the results of yesterday's meeting were inconvenient to tell because they have not yet reached the stage of publication. The Shipping Administration Meeting of the Ministry of Communications is now scheduled to be held in Beijing on the 20th of this month. There are many proposals from all parties to reform the government, and they will be discussed item by item at the conference so that the domestic shipping industry can be refreshed.</p>

<h3>The Wuhu-Zhejiang Railway Extends to Nanjing</h3>
<p>Decision Made at Yesterday's Board of Directors Meeting</p>
<p>The Wuhu-Zhejiang Railway Company held a joint meeting of the board of directors and supervisors at around 4:00 yesterday afternoon.  Many directors and supervisors attended, including Zhang Jingjiang, Li Shizeng, Ye Chucang, Zhang Xiaolin, Du Yuesheng, Ye Zhuotang, and Zhang Danru. Zhang Xiaolin chaired the meeting, and it was decided that: (1) The Wuhu-Zhejiang railway line will be extended from Wuhu to Nanjing; (2) The annual shareholders' meeting will be held on the 12th of next month. It is heard that the railway construction is currently underway, the line has been built to Zhusigang, and it is already open to traffic.</p>
<h3>The Two Railway Bureaus Improve Passenger Car Equipment</h3>
<p>Special Emphasis on Third and Fourth Class Cars</p>
<p>The two railway bureaus, noting that the appearance and interior of the existing cars of all classes on the two lines have not yet been perfected, in addition to ordering the formulation of standard styles for the cars, instructed the Mechanical and Rolling Stock Departments to improve the following points in advance: (1) Those with old colors should be repainted to improve appearance. Although the color of each train cannot be absolutely uniform in terms of newness and depth, it should at least be similar. The principle of using domestic goods should be adopted for paint, and all tabletops for teacups in the carriages should be replaced with Chinese lacquer to avoid damage from heat; (2) The air in the carriages should be kept clean at all times, so there should be adequate ventilation equipment.  Special attention should be paid to third and fourth class cars where passengers are crowded, and those without equipment should be installed as soon as possible; (3) In toilets of all classes of passenger cars, the lavatory equipment should be manufactured with porcelain; (4) The lighting in the carriages should be sufficient. The current lighting in third and fourth class cars is too dim and should be increased immediately; (5) The heating in the carriages in winter should be the same for third and fourth class cars as for first class cars; (6) Coat and hat hooks should be added to carriages where they are missing; (7) Third and fourth class cars have a large number of passengers, and fans should be installed in summer to emphasize hygiene; (8) The kitchen in the dining car should be equipped with electric ventilators to avoid odors from spreading. As the revenue from the two railways comes mainly from third and fourth class passenger tickets, special attention must be paid to the treatment of third and fourth class passengers. The two departments are instructed to discuss and handle this matter carefully and complete it within a time limit to benefit passengers.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Council Stipulates the Maximum Rickshaw Rental Fee</h3>
<p>Renting for 24 Hours</p>
<p>Costs 80 Cents</p>
<p>At the Municipal Council meeting held this Wednesday, a resolution was proposed to stipulate the maximum rickshaw rental fee at 80 cents for 24 hours of rental, with hourly reductions for rentals less than 24 hours, effective from July 1st. The rental fees for rickshaw companies will be determined by the Municipal Council, and a clause will be added to the rickshaw licenses stating that "rental fees shall not exceed the amount stipulated by the Municipal Council." The resolution was submitted to the Municipal Council by a joint committee composed of the Police Committee and the Transportation Committee. After much debate, it was decided that it would be discussed at the next meeting. The joint committee is currently continuing to study the report of the Rickshaw Committee.</p>
<h3>The Cotton Industry Control Commission Dispatches Personnel to Shaanxi to Distribute Cotton Seeds</h3>
<p>Cotton Seeds Detained in Lingbao Will Arrive in Xi'an Soon</p>
<p>Shanxi and Hunan Provinces Plan to Improve Cotton Seeds</p>
<p>The National Economic Council's Cotton Industry Control Commission, in response to the request of the Construction Department of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, jointly established the Cotton Industry Improvement Office with the province to improve cotton seeds in Shaanxi Province. The Cotton Industry Control Commission, recognizing that the national cotton production is insufficient to supply domestic yarn factories, resulting in foreign cotton invading our country's market and money flowing out, which is truly distressing, plans to make every effort to promote cotton planting in various provinces. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Purchasing Improved Seeds: After the Shaanxi Provincial Government jointly established the Cotton Industry Improvement Office with the Cotton Industry Control Commission, it actively prepared to improve cotton seeds. Therefore, it entrusted the Cotton Industry Control Commission to purchase American cotton seeds in Zhangde, Henan, totaling 4,400 dan, which were transported to Lingbao by the Commission. Because the Shaanxi Provincial Government was troubled by economic difficulties, it negotiated with the Longhai Railway for free transportation to Tongguan.  The railway has now approved the request, and the seeds will arrive at Tongguan soon. After arriving at Tongguan, they will be transported to Xi'an by long-distance bus.</p>
<p>Establishing Cooperatives: The Cotton Industry Control Commission, recognizing that the weather is gradually warming and cotton will be planted soon, specially dispatched Xu Zhongdi, an expert from the Raw Materials Department, to Shaanxi to establish the Cotton Industry Improvement Office to distribute cotton seeds. He departed the day before yesterday (the 7th) and will arrive on the 13th of this month. The above cotton seeds can be planted on more than 80,000 mu of cotton fields. Each mu can harvest about 50 sheng of cotton in a normal harvest, and the total annual harvest is about 400,000 dan, which can not only supplement the needs of national yarn factories but also reduce the import of foreign cotton. After farmers harvest and sell to the market, the Commission, fearing that merchants will manipulate prices, also plans to organize agricultural cooperatives so that farmers can get good prices when selling their produce.</p>
<p>Promoting in Various Provinces: After the Shaanxi Province cotton seed improvement, the Commission will also promote it in various provinces. Shanxi and Hunan are also in the planning stage. Because the soil in these two provinces contains saline, the irrigation method will be used first to gradually wash away the saline, and then cotton seeds will be planted to ensure that national cotton can be self-sufficient and does not need to rely on foreign cotton. However, it is still difficult to implement this in the short term. As for the investigation specialists sent to various places, because they need to conduct detailed investigations, it will be difficult for them to return to Shanghai in the near future.</p>

<h3>Tianjin Yuyuan Yarn Factory Scheduled to Resume Operations</h3>
<p>A Total of 1,600 Workers Were Laid Off</p>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency stated that the Tianjin Yuyuan Yarn Factory, affected by the economic downturn, with accumulated yarn and financial difficulties, announced its shutdown at the end of last year.

<h3>Public Concession Tram Workers Demand a General Wage Increase from the Company</h3>
<p>Proposed Six Conditions for Adoption</p>
<p>Opposed the Unwarranted Dismissal of a Large Number of Workers</p>
<p>The Da Gong News Agency stated that the Shanghai Tram Company's Hart Road Old Factory and Tilanqiao New Factory employ a total of more than 2,000 drivers and conductors. The company's treatment of workers' wages is not generous. From February 1st of this year, the company increased workers' wages by 1.5 yuan, but the workers believed that the increase was too small and it was still difficult to maintain a livelihood, which inevitably led to malpractices. The company has successively dismissed as many as 40 conductors in the past month, which caused public outrage. They have reported to the union one after another, requesting negotiations.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Company</h3>
<p>The Three District Water and Electricity Workers' Union, after receiving reports from the workers, believed that the matter was of great importance. After several meetings, the result was that they would actively eliminate the bad habits of corruption. However, the treatment still needs to be improved. After public decision, a letter was sent to the Shanghai Tram Company, requesting adoption. The original letter said, "To the esteemed: According to reports from members of the union, the cost of living is high, and it is difficult to maintain a livelihood with the company's announced treatment of workers. Therefore, there are occasional malpractices by conductors, etc. Now, in order to be honest and clean on our own initiative, after several meetings, it has been decided that the problem of malpractices will be eliminated in the future. However, the problem of workers' treatment needs to be improved by the company. Six conditions for improvement have now been drafted, and it is proposed to negotiate with the company to maintain livelihoods and eliminate disputes, etc. Based on this, it is true that the income of workers serving the company does not cover expenses, and it is also true that ticket sellers, etc., engage in malpractices because they are forced to do so. Now, they are willing to reform themselves and demand improved treatment in order to obtain the double benefits of labor and management, which is only fitting. A special letter is sent to you, hoping that your company will adopt it and send a plenipotentiary representative to negotiate with the union's representatives on a regular basis to formally sign a treaty to eliminate all disputes and secure the livelihood of the workers, and we beg that you give a satisfactory reply within a week so that it can be forwarded to the workers."</p>
<h3>Six Conditions</h3>
<p>In order to maintain their livelihoods, the workers have put forward six conditions for improved treatment: (1) Starting from March 1934, the company should increase the workers' original wages by 8 yuan per month, and subsidize monthly housing expenses of 8 yuan; (2) All workers who are dismissed by the company or resign voluntarily will receive severance pay, one month's salary for those who have worked for one year, two months' salary for those who have worked for two years, and so on; (3) In the future, the company shall not accept reports from Chinese and foreign ticket inspectors without evidence; (4) Those who work for 22 days must apply for 4 days of work; (5) Workers who are sick and enter the hospital must be paid wages as usual; (6) The company shall not dismiss workers without reason.</p>

<h3>Opening of the Municipal Infectious Disease Hospital</h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Health has been actively preparing for the establishment of an infectious disease hospital due to the current lack of such facilities in the city. The Municipal Infectious Disease Hospital has been established on the former site of the Chinese Public Hospital on Tiantong'an Road in Zhabei and is now ready. Outpatient services will begin today. The details of the process are outlined below:</p>
<p>Preparatory Process: The Chinese Public Hospital in Zhabei was destroyed during the January 28th Incident. The Municipal Bureau of Health, recognizing the urgent need for an infectious disease hospital, repeatedly communicated with the hospital's board of directors. An agreement was reached to allocate the original site of the hospital to the Municipal Bureau of Health for the establishment of an infectious disease hospital. With the consent of the hospital authorities, the Municipal Bureau of Health immediately proceeded to formulate a plan, prepare a budget, and submit it to the municipal government for approval. Subsequently, Wu Liguo, the chief of the second section of the Municipal Bureau of Health, and others were appointed to begin preparations.</p>
<p>Opening Today: The Municipal Bureau of Health recognized that the existing buildings of the public hospital required renovation. The municipal government allocated funds for the renovation of the buildings and the purchase of essential medical supplies and equipment to meet the urgent need. Wu Liguo was officially appointed to temporarily serve as the director of the Municipal Infectious Disease Hospital, with Zhu Shenzhi as the chief of medical affairs and Ms. Xu as the chief of nursing. The hospital has fifty beds and will begin providing outpatient services today.</p>
<p>Future Plans: The Municipal Bureau of Health recognizes that the existing buildings of the hospital will not be sufficient to meet the needs of the city's large population in the future. The municipal government has approved an allocation of 30,000 yuan from the Zhabei Charitable Race Lottery to build two two-story Western-style buildings. Construction has already begun and is expected to be completed within six months. Plans are to expand the hospital to twenty-five buildings in the future, but the project has been temporarily postponed due to a lack of funding.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Various Agencies to Visit the Xiyi Highway Opening Ceremony Today</h3>
<p>The Entire Route is 66 Kilometers Long</p>
<p>The Wuxi-Yixing Highway has been completed, with a total length of 66 kilometers. The road surface was constructed by the Jiangnan Company at a cost of 150,000 yuan. The project has been registered with the Jiangsu Construction Department. The company held an opening ceremony today and will start round trip services between Wuxi and Yixing at 9:00 am this morning. The company also invited representatives from various agencies in Shanghai to attend. It is reported that the Changzhou-Yixing Highway is being funded by prominent businessmen from Wujin, and the project has been filed with the Construction Department and is beginning to solicit investment. The Construction Department has reportedly approved the request. The authorities are very willing to have merchants undertake major highway construction projects connecting important towns on the Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) National Highway to facilitate transportation.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council to Increase Bicycle Tax</h3>
<p>Effective from New Year's Day Next Year</p>
<p>Magnet Fee to be Increased Next Month</p>
<p>The municipal authorities of the French Concession recently informed the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement that the bicycle tax in the French Concession will increase from three yuan to four yuan per year starting January 1, 1935, and a magnet fee will be added. They inquired whether the Shanghai Municipal Council could do the same. This proposal was submitted to the Finance Committee on March 2nd and was deemed feasible. The issuance of bicycle licenses was initially intended for inspection and traffic management purposes, not primarily for tax revenue. However, considering the convenience enjoyed by cyclists and the cost of police management, increasing the tax to four yuan per year is not excessive. This proposal has now been approved by the board of directors and will be implemented next year. At the same time, starting April 1st of this year, a magnet fee will be added, estimated at about two jiao (cents) per piece. It is estimated that the increase in the bicycle tax will generate an additional 33,500 yuan in revenue per year.</p>

<h3>Conflict Between Japanese National and Customs Police at Wayside Wharf</h3>
<p>Customs Authorities Investigating</p>
<p>According to the Customs Foreign Staff Club, yesterday (9th) at around 5:00 PM, the Japanese ship Asama Maru arrived from Hong Kong and docked at Wayside Wharf. As per regulations, personnel from the Jianghai Customs were dispatched to inspect baggage and maintain order. Suddenly, two Japanese nationals brazenly rushed towards the barrier set up by the Jianghai Customs. The customs police guarding the barrier asked if they had passes. One of the Japanese nationals replied that they were officials from the Japanese Consulate. The customs police informed them of the Jianghai Customs regulations, which stated that only those with passes or wearing official uniforms were allowed to pass. While the customs police were discussing the matter with them, another Japanese national punched the customs police officer to the ground, injuring his fingers and causing them to bleed profusely. The two Japanese nationals then forced their way through the barrier. It is reported that the Jianghai Customs authorities are currently investigating this incident in order to negotiate with the Japanese Consulate.</p>

<h3>Changsha Shallow Water Fees Reduced Today</h3>
<p>Originally Increased by 50%</p>
<p>Now Changed to 20%</p>
<p>The water level in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River was very shallow last time, making navigation difficult. The six shipping companies in Shanghai had increased the shallow water surcharge by 50% on the Hankou-Changsha section. Recently, the river water in the upper reaches has risen, and navigation on the Hunan route is now free. Yesterday, after a meeting of the six companies, it was decided that from today, the freight rate for the Hankou-Changsha section will be reduced by 30% from the previous 50% increase, changing it to a shallow water surcharge of 20%. This has been notified to all customs brokers and passengers.</p>
<h3>Paint Merchants Dong Rongqing and Others Establish Large-Scale Paint Factory</h3>
<p>Capital Temporarily Set at One Million Yuan</p>
<p>Machinery Purchased from Germany</p>
<p>The dyeing pigments needed by our country have always been imported from abroad, resulting in losses of nearly one million yuan annually. Recently, more than a dozen major paint merchants, including Dong Rongqing, Li Shuyan, and Qiu Hongsheng, have been actively planning to establish a factory for self-production in order to prevent these losses and achieve resistance. Various establishment methods have been drafted, and the capital is temporarily set at one million yuan. The factory will be located in Minhang and will be very large in scale. It is reported that manufacturing machinery has been purchased from Germany and is expected to arrive in Shanghai by the end of March this year. As soon as the machinery arrives, preparations for establishment can begin. The pigments to be produced will initially be sulfurized and calcium sulfide.</p>

<h3>National Cargo Transportation to Change to Kilogram System Starting June 1st</h3>
<p>100 Jin Equals 60.479 Kilograms</p>
<p>Various Shipping Companies Busy Preparing</p>
<p>The import and export of goods in Shanghai have always been calculated in terms of dan (picul), tonnage, and size. For example, one ton of goods is calculated as 2,240 pounds in weight or 40 cubic feet in size. If calculated in dan, it is customary to use 100 pieces as one dan. The shipping companies' import and export cargo transportation charges are also calculated based on this weight. For decades, although freight rates have fluctuated, the weights and measures have always been based on this method. Recently, the Ministry of Finance implemented the new weights and measures system and has decided that from June 1st of this year, the national customs will uniformly use kilograms to calculate import and export goods. After receiving this order, the shipping companies in Shanghai realized that the original freight charges and calculation methods based on weight would have to be completely overturned. The freight rates must be revised according to the new regulations. As the date of implementation is not far away,</p>
<p>The various companies are currently revising the freight rates. The information gathered is recorded below:</p>
<h3>Changes to Dan</h3>
<p>Regardless of whether goods are imported or exported from the Yangtze River, inland rivers, or coastal areas, the payment of tax rates and freight charges is generally based on three categories: valuation, weight, and size. Most of the grains, salt, sugar, and northbound and southbound shipments are calculated by weight, so the freight charges in the shipping companies' tariff are more frequently based on weight than on size. Historically, the weight of goods has been based on the dan. Sixteen dan and eighty jin equal one ton, and freight charges are determined accordingly. Now, the new regulations of the Ministry of Finance abolish the originally established system of 100 jin per dan and convert all weight-based goods to kilograms. The specified amount of 100 jin is equivalent to 60.479 kilograms. That is, 100 jin of goods is converted to 60.479 kilograms, and one ton is equivalent to 1059 dan and a bit more. This is different from the original 168 dan.</p>
<h3>Revision of Freight Charges</h3>
<p>Because weight-based goods must be converted to kilograms, the weighing of goods that go on and off ships will be done using kilogram scales that the shipping companies and cargo warehouses will uniformly obtain from the Ministry of Finance. The packaging of various goods will also use kilograms as the unit. The originally set freight charges for various Yangtze River and sea routes will be revised for weight-based goods converted to kilograms, while a small number of goods based on size and valuation will not need to be changed. The shipping companies in Shanghai are already discussing the new kilogram freight rates. For example, the freight rate for goods going up the Yangtze River to Hankou, which was originally 9 jiao (cents) per dan, will increase to 1 yuan and 4 jiao and 9 fen after the conversion to kilograms. The original price of 1 yuan and 6 jiao will increase to 2 yuan and 6 jiao and 4 fen, and the original price of 2 yuan and 4 jiao will increase to 3 yuan and 9 jiao and 6 fen, an increase of 65% over the original freight rate. This is not only the case for the Yangtze River, but also for the coastal areas.</p>
<h3>Implementation on June 1st</h3>
<p>The new kilogram system has been identified by the Jianghai Customs and will be implemented from June 1st of this year. The area of implementation includes not only the Yangtze River, the North and South Seas, and various inland rivers, but also all areas under the jurisdiction of the central government. Before May 31st, all shipping companies must complete the revision of the new freight rates for various routes, print and distribute new tariff booklets to customs brokers and passengers. Goods shipped from foreign ports to Shanghai will also be handled in the same way. The shipping companies have already notified their branch offices in various locations to quickly prepare for the conversion to kilogram freight rates and to expedite all procedures related to this matter in order to avoid being caught off guard and hindering the implementation of government orders. It is said that the most important aspect of the central government's conversion to the kilogram system is the increase in salt tax revenue. It is estimated that after the rigorous implementation of the new system, annual salt tax revenue can increase by 30% to 40%. Currently, salt merchants in various regions are requesting an exemption from the conversion.</p>

<h3>Deceptive Phone Prank</h3>
<p>Japanese Restaurants</p>
<p>Suffer Significant Losses</p>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Shanghai Daily News, recently, Japanese restaurants in Shanghai have been receiving phone calls placing large orders for banquets, often for dozens of guests. These restaurants, in this time of economic downturn, are overjoyed to receive such calls. However, after preparing the food and drinks and waiting until late at night, no customers arrive. Moreover, various restaurants receive similar calls on the same day, so the number of affected restaurants is very high. Although they have repeatedly reported this to the Japanese Consulate General, the authorities are unable to investigate due to the difficulty of searching.</p>
<h3>Love Suicide Case at the Yangtze Hotel</h3>
<p>Not Due to Economic Reasons</p>
<p>But Due to Unfree Marriage</p>
<p>At around 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, a young man and a woman resembling a female student checked into the Yangtze Hotel on Hankou Road. The front desk led them to Room 724 on the seventh floor. The young man identified himself as Ge Yiqun, a 24-year-old from Pinghu. He stated that the woman was his relative. He paid seven yuan for the room and the staff delivered tea and water to the room. The young man then made three or four phone calls to friends in Nanshi. Soon after, several guests visited, but left shortly after. Around 8:00 PM, the two had dinner in the room and did not go out. Around 9:00 PM, they closed the door and went to bed. However, at 12:00 PM yesterday, the two had not yet gotten up. A tea server at the hotel went to knock on the door to ask if the room was still needed, as is customary. However, there was no response for a long time, so he became suspicious. He found a way to open the door and enter, and found the two lying side by side in bed, their faces pale, their necks wrapped with a trouser belt, white foam coming from their mouths, and they had been dead for a long time. The tea server was shocked and immediately reported it to the front desk, who in turn reported it to the Laozha Police Station. Patrol officer No. 106 rushed to the scene to investigate. He searched the room and found two suicide notes, which stated that they were not dying for economic reasons, but because their marriage was not free. The patrol officer transported the two bodies to the Forensic Examination Office on Fielun Road, pending an examination by the court this morning. He reported back to the police chief and filed the suicide notes for investigation to determine the identities of the deceased and the truth before proceeding.</p>
<h3>Murder Due to Failed Loan Request</h3>
<p>Tang Zhaokun Dies Tragically</p>
<p>Tang Zhaokun, a 33-year-old resident of foreign origin residing at No. 247 in the Yangjiadu garbage pond in Pudong, owned two barges and was a small businessman. A fellow villager, Hou Zhenqing, recently asked him for a loan of several yuan, but Tang refused, saying he had no money. Hou left disappointed. At around 12:00 PM yesterday, Hou suddenly arrived again. Tang offered him a meal and ordered his wife to go ashore to buy cigarettes. While she was gone, Hou took the opportunity to ask Tang for a loan. When they disagreed, Hou pulled out a gun and fired a shot at him, hitting him in the head. He fell to the ground, covered in blood. The murderer took the opportunity to escape without a trace. When Zhaokun's wife returned, she immediately reported it to the water patrol team, who took him to Baolong Hospital, but he died at 6:10 PM.</p>
<h3>Court Auctions Coffins</h3>
<p>Coffin Shop Sealed Due to Guaranteeing a Loan</p>
<p>Unable to Repay Money, Coffins Used as Collateral</p>
<p>Yongxiangfeng Yuanyuan Shouxiqi Hao, a coffin shop located at No. 35 Renxing Street in Yangshupu, acted as a guarantor for Shi Si-hai in a rent dispute lawsuit filed by Anderxin in the Shanghai First Special District Local Court. The court ruled that Shi had to repay the rent owed, but Shi was unable to fulfill the debt. Therefore, the court ordered the guarantor to be responsible and sealed the Yongxiangfeng store. A long time has passed since then, and the guarantor has still not repaid the debt. The First Special District Court has ruled that all the property in the Yongxiangfeng store should be auctioned off and the proceeds used to repay the debt. It is reported that the current property of the store consists of two finished coffins and 45 pieces of raw wood for making coffins. The court has estimated the minimum selling price of the two coffins at 70 yuan, and the raw wood at 67.5 yuan. Chief Judge Guo has issued an auction announcement, setting the auction to begin at 9:00 AM on the 15th of this month. Anyone who wishes to purchase these items can go to the First Special Court at that time and ask the clerk and bailiff in charge of the case to accompany them to Yangshupu to view and purchase the goods. However, this is the first time coffins have been auctioned, so it is unknown whether there will be as much enthusiastic bidding as for other items.</p>
<h3>Not Asking Wife to Eat, but Eating with Female Servant</h3>
<p>Wife Inraged, Dies of Poisoning</p>
<p>Trouble Often Starts From Small Things</p>
<p>Wang Tangshi, a 21-year-old woman from Ningbo, was married to Wang Jiazhu, who runs the Wang Shuntai woolen shop at No. 617 Nanjing Road. They had been married for three years and were usually harmonious. The day before yesterday, at lunchtime, Wang ordered the female servant to eat at the same table. Mrs. Wang was suspicious that her husband did not ask his wife to eat, but cared about the female servant. She immediately argued with her husband. Wang, in turn, was displeased that his wife was so suspicious and beat her slightly. Mrs. Wang was extremely angry and suddenly had thoughts of ending her life. She secretly swallowed opium and tried to commit suicide. Wang discovered this and rushed her to Renji Hospital, but the treatment was ineffective and she died. The hospital reported this to the Laozha Police Station, who sent detectives to investigate. They took the body to the Forensic Examination Office on Fielun Road. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Guo Wei from the First Special District Local Court arrived at the office to examine the body. He determined that Wang Tangshi had died from opium poisoning. According to Wang Jiazhu, he had called the female servant to eat, and his wife said, "What does it have to do with you whether she eats or not?" and then argued with him. After obtaining this information, Mr. Guo ruled that the deceased Wang Tangshi had indeed died from opium poisoning and handed the body over to her husband, Wang Jiazhu, with a signed statement for him to take back for coffin burial.</p>

<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to Implement Anti-Theft Equipment on All Ships</h3>
<p>Puan Wheel Has Been Installed and Scheduled to Sail to Qingdao Today</p>
<p>Kidnapped Passengers Still Have No News of Escape</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Shanghai-Qingdao line Puan Wheel has been repaired and equipped with anti-theft equipment. It is scheduled to sail to Qingdao this morning. The kidnapped passengers have not yet escaped. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Repaired and Reopened</h3>
<p>After the Puan Wheel collided with a British blue funnel cargo ship on the Huangpu River, it was taken to the Gaochangmiao Naval Jiangnan Shipyard for repairs. It has now been repaired and all the cabins and seats have been repainted. It is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Qingdao at 9:00 AM this morning, resuming its schedule. It was berthed at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Huazhan in Pudong yesterday. As for the British blue funnel company's request for compensation for losses, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company believes that it was not at fault, so the issue of liability for the collision will be decided according to law.</p>
<h3>Anti-Theft Device Installation</h3>
<p>After the Executive Yuan issued the anti-theft regulations, Liu Hongsheng, the general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, decided to install anti-theft equipment on all river and sea ships in accordance with the law. The Puan Wheel on the Shanghai-Qingdao line was the first to be equipped. It has now been installed. Iron doors have been installed to separate the first-class cabins, second-class cabins, and steerage. The bridge deck has also been equipped with iron doors to prevent unauthorized personnel from entering. All first-class passengers must have a guarantor when purchasing tickets for prevention. The above measures will be implemented from today.</p>
<h3>Rescuing Passengers</h3>
<p>The Puan Wheel was hijacked by pirates in Dapeng Bay outside Wusongkou while sailing from Shanghai to Qingdao. Regarding the case of nine passengers being kidnapped, the families of the passengers sent representatives to Shantou to negotiate with the pirates regarding ransom payments. However, because the pirates demanded too much money, there has been no news of escape for two months. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company needs to have Sun Zhenwu, the manager of the Qingdao branch, return to Shanghai to preside over the joint transportation with the Jiaoji Railway. A telegram has been sent to Sun Zhenwu urging him to return to Qingdao from Guangdong as soon as possible so that it can be implemented soon.</p>
<p>In the First Criminal Court's trial, the police prosecuted Mao Renfu for repeated theft. Mao Renfu confessed to the theft without denial. The court ordered the defendant to be remanded to custody and scheduled sentencing for the 14th.</p>

<h3>Burglary on Beijing Road Last Night</h3>

<h3>The Case of the Woman Hanging Herself in Chongming, Opening the Coffin</h3>
<p>Decomposed Flesh Makes Confirmation Difficult</p>
<p>Unknown Use for Foreign Potatoes</p>
<p>Qiu Chuanlang, a villager from Xinkaihe Town in Chongming, had a daughter named Yin Xian, who was married to Yang Miaolang, a farmer in the same area. They had separated due to disagreements, but later reconciled after litigation. In May of the previous year, according to the old lunar calendar, Yin Xian suddenly hanged herself in the living room of their home. Qiu Chuanlang then filed a lawsuit accusing Yang Miaolang of causing her death through harm. The case remained unresolved in the original county, so the High Court instructed the Shanghai Local Court to transport the coffin to Shanghai for re-examination at the Zhenru Forensic Institute. The institute has now opened the coffin, revealing that the deceased's flesh has decomposed. There were foreign potatoes in the coffin, the purpose of which is unknown. The deceased's abdomen contained a fetus with a human form. However, due to the decomposition of the body, the presence of skin or injuries on it cannot be confirmed. Therefore, a preliminary examination was conducted, and it was reported that the ribs under the breasts seemed to show signs of injury, but it was stated that this could not be confirmed. The institute will remove all the bones and decomposed flesh, use chemicals for testing, and then provide a report to the court. Director Lin of the institute also questioned both parties about the circumstances at the time for reference. According to Qiu Chuanlang, after his daughter's marriage, she was manipulated by her husband's younger sister, leading to mistreatment by her mother-in-law. Her husband, listening to his mother and sister, formed a group of abusers and inflicted beatings, which was the reason for the litigation over separation. He also stated that the so-called hanging occurred at noon, but farmers typically return home for lunch at noon, so it would be impossible for anyone to witness the suicide. Therefore, he alleged that it was a premeditated murder followed by a hanging to create a misleading situation. The defendant, Yang Miaolang, still claimed that his wife committed suicide because she was scolded for not being able to find clothes at her parents' home and became angry. Director Lin then dismissed them and told them to await further instructions.</p>
<h3>Gangster Guo Ronghua Sentenced to Seven Years</h3>
<p>Guo Ronghua, a Ningbo native also known as Yao Xindi, was sentenced for participating in armed robberies between December 28, 1929, and January 5, 1930, with Dai Rongxiang and others (who have already been arrested and convicted).

After the case was reported, Xu Yongyuan, a Chinese detective from the Huishan Police Station, arrested Guo on the 27th of last month in Donggui Lane, Huade Road, and handed him over to the First Special District Court. After thorough interrogation, he was found guilty. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xieffen presided over the third criminal court and sentenced Guo Ronghua to seven years of imprisonment. The number of days of detention before the final judgment will be counted as one day of imprisonment for every two days of detention.</p>
<h3>More Accomplices Arrested in Smuggling and Murder Case</h3>
<p>Wang Chengying, a Chinese detective, and Yang Xiguang, a detective from the Jiaxing Road Police Station, previously arrested six bandits, Cao Zhenxi, Xu Debiao, Du Baoliang, Tang Xuyou, Ma Linxiang, and Li Chunsheng. Investigation revealed that they and others conspired to rob Derun Silk Products Factory at 914 Gonghe Xin Road, Zhabei, on the morning of January 22nd, at around 4:00 AM, using weapons to steal valuables worth 100 yuan and fatally shooting Tang Xiangshou, a Ningbo native and the factory manager, aged 49. They were handed over to the First Special District Court. Li Chunsheng later confessed to the police that accomplices including Xia Shaqiu and Gu Rufang, both from Jiangbei, had conspired with Ding Yunsheng, Liu Shanzhou, and others around December 12, 1929, to shoot and kill Xie Baosheng (aka Ah Bao) on Putuo Road in the Public Concession. Xie was an employee of the No. 9 Cotton Mill inside and outside Robert's Road and also served as a secret agent for a certain organization, suggesting that his death had political motives. Western and Chinese detectives handling the case subsequently arrested Xia and three others at 3530 Yinghua Lane, Robert's Road, 185 Tokyo Road, and the Central Mint on Zhongshan Road. They were sent to the Third Criminal Court and completely denied the charges. Yesterday, Detective Wang and Detective Yang arrested Wang Ruiting, a Jiangbei native, and Fu Shatang, a Nanjing native, at 182 Binlang Road and 12 Tokyo Road. They were taken to the police station and will be sent to the court for questioning.</p>
<h3>The Case of the Unfilial Son Threatening His Mother with a Gun Concludes</h3>
<p>Ding Afu, a local resident of 2 Taide Lane, Xujiahui Road, in the French Concession, is 33 years old. His father died when he was three, and he was raised by his mother, Wang. She enabled him to learn the rice business, but he developed addictions and lost his job, becoming idle. Recently, he often asked his mother for money, and she refused to give it to him because she could not stand his harassment. On the evening of the 27th of last month, Afu secretly brought a used six-round automatic pistol home and threatened his mother, extorting two yuan. His mother called neighbors to help tie him up and reported the incident to the police, who dispatched detectives to arrest him and hand him over to the Second Special District Court for investigation. The details have been reported previously. Yesterday morning, President Wang Gangxu of the Second Special Court continued the trial in the First Criminal Court. Gu Shouxi, a lawyer for the police station, explained the police investigation and filed charges of threatening a relative. The plaintiff, Ding Wang, then recounted the circumstances of her unfilial son's threat and extortion. Ding Afu claimed that he bought the pistol from a second-hand goods stall for five yuan and twenty cents last December. He said that he was drunk on the night in question and always carried the pistol with him, but he did not threaten his mother, asking for leniency. The court reviewed the evidence, announced the conclusion of the debate, and scheduled the sentencing for the 13th. The defendant remains in custody pending further instructions.</p>
<h3>City Detectives Capture Three Attempted Robbers</h3>
<p>Lu Ying, captain of the detective team of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, received a report from detective You Hanwen that a group of bandits was gathering in secret at the Sunji Teahouse at 167 Jumen Road outside the Old West Gate, plotting to rob a certain shop. Captain Lu immediately dispatched detectives Pan Huanzhang and others, all disguised as workers, to the teahouse to wait. Soon, two men entered, looked around, and then began whispering to each other. The detectives deemed their actions suspicious and gave a prearranged signal. They drew their weapons and ordered the men to stand up and be searched. A Browning pistol and two bullets were found on Zhang Jinfu. An eight-inch revolver and three bullets were found on Zhu Koukou. At the same time, another accomplice, Jiang A'gen, was apprehended at the entrance of the teahouse. After they were brought back to the team, Captain Lu conducted a preliminary interrogation. Zhang Jinfu, 31 years old from Nantong, confessed that at 7:00 PM on September 20th of last year, he and five other acquaintances, including Lu Jintao, robbed the Dingfeng Candle and Soap Factory at Xinqiao Tou, Old West Gate, stealing 1,300 yuan in banknotes and 3,000 jiao in small change. They took the money to a small inn on East Zilaihuo Street in the French Concession, where they divided the loot and spent it. Three pistols were used during the robbery, two of which are the ones he carried today. There was also a six-inch Browning pistol that Lu Jintao had. However, Lu Jintao has been arrested by the Xinzha Police Station, and the weapon has been confiscated. He also confessed that around June of last year, he, Zhou Zilian, A'si, and others carried two pistols and robbed a tobacco and paper shop on Jumen Road, stealing over 40 yuan, which they divided and spent. Recently, A'er, who had been a steward at the Tonghe Sauce Garden near the Small West Gate, was dismissed by the owner and harbored resentment. He proposed robbing the garden. After discussing it with Zhou Zilian and A'si, Zhou Zilian instructed him to recruit Zhu Koukou and Jiang A'gen. Zhou Zilian then distributed two pistols to Zhang Jinfu and Zhu Koukou, and they agreed to go to the Tonghe Sauce Garden to rob it tonight. However, because it was still early, they were drinking tea at the Sunji Teahouse while waiting for the right opportunity when they were caught. Zhou Zilian and A'si managed to escape. Zhu Koukou (aka Lao Er, 32 years old, residing at 59 Tangjia Bay) and Jiang A'gen (aka Ma Shun, 40 years old, residing at 5 Kangti Road) confessed that Zhou Zilian asked them to go to the robbery with Zhang Jinfu and others to secretly monitor their actions and prevent them from escaping with the stolen goods. Because the matter concerned a robbery case, Captain Lu ordered a written report to be prepared and the three robbers, along with the weapons, to be sent to the Third Division of the General Bureau for interrogation and punishment.</p>
<h3>Russian Dies in Detention Center</h3>
<p>Russian citizen Shidelainigefu Alaige Shangte (transliteration), 40 years old, was homeless and begging for a living in Shanghai. At 4:30 PM on the 8th, he was found drunk and unconscious at the corner of Songshan Road and Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession. A French police officer from the French Police Station found him while patrolling and brought him to the Xiahfei Road Police Station, then sent him to the Lujiawan General Police Station for detention. At 8:45 PM that evening, he died in the detention center. The guard discovered the body and reported it to the head of the police station, who sent detectives to transport the body to the autopsy room of the Shanghai Municipal Council Hospital on Tairas Tuol Road. Yesterday morning, the Second Special District Local Court appointed Prosecutor Wang Ren and a forensic doctor to examine the body, confirming that the deceased died of illness.

<h3>Suspicious Cause of Death of Unknown Male Corpse</h3>
<p>At around 8:30 AM on the morning of the [day of the week not specified], a doctor from the Southeast Medical College of Zhenru, on his way from Shanghai to the college, was traveling by car along the Beizhongshan Road near the Shanghai West Power Plant when he suddenly saw a man resembling a worker lying on the ground, with three or four villagers looking on. The doctor stopped the car and examined the man closely, finding that he was severely injured and on the verge of death. He inquired with the villagers, who said that they had just seen an empty truck carrying lime, with six or seven workers lying on the truck bed, speeding from north to south. When it reached that spot, the man suddenly fell off, and the truck continued speeding away. It was assumed that the other workers and the driver on the truck had not noticed. The doctor immediately helped the man into the car and took him to the hospital, but he had already died. The hospital reported the incident to the Fourth District Third Precinct, which then reported it to the Sixth District because the incident occurred within the Sixth District's jurisdiction. After receiving the report, District Chief Tan ordered Police Chief Hu to first investigate the scene of the incident and inquire with the villagers, but they only said that they saw the man fall from an empty truck, and because it was driving so fast, they could not see the license plate. The unnamed man was about 30 years old, and his clothes were old and worn. He died from internal injuries and brain trauma. A photograph and fingerprints were taken, and the area was reported to the Local Court for examination. District Chief Tan ordered an investigation into the truck and the man's family so that the case could be investigated.</p>

After questioning the defendants, Judge Sun Pengzhen determined that the cigarettes were brought in by street vendors, and they did not know they were tax-evading and illegal. The court immediately sentenced Chen Yi to a fine of 40 yuan and Chen Songshi to a fine of 30 yuan. The tax-evading cigarettes were confiscated.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>We have found that today (i.e., March 9), your newspaper's local news column contains information that a British employee of the Health Department of the British Works Bureau, Mr. Hoffer, sent a letter to 475 Lafayette Road, Weiltai, by post last month, containing a HSBC bank check. However, because the letter was mistakenly delivered by the postman to 275 Lafayette Road, the check was fraudulently claimed by others. After reading it, this bureau was very surprised because there was no misdelivery of mail. We immediately sent staff to Mr. Hoffer's office to inquire about the matter. According to the Englishman, "The address on the letter was mistakenly written as 275 by myself, and it was not a misdelivery by the postman. It has nothing to do with the post office. The information in the newspaper is unfounded," etc. In addition to obtaining a statement from the sender for filing with the bureau, we hereby inform you and hope that you will correct it as soon as possible to conform to the facts. Sincerely, To the Shen Bao Newspaper Office, Shanghai Postal Administration, March 9.</p>
<p>To the Editor, I am writing to inform you that, according to our client, Ye Guang Company, today's Shen Xin newspapers both contain a news item about the housing lawsuit in Shoupinli, Huade Road, which states that the houses were originally the property of Yipin Foreign Company, sold to Ye Guang Company, and rented out by Ye Guang through Gao Yi Public House. We were very surprised to read this. After investigation, the houses are completely unrelated to this company. It is untrue to claim that this company is the owner. We fear that the outside world will be unaware and may harm the reputation of this company. We request that your lawyer send a letter separately to declare and request correction. Sincerely, To the Chief Editor of Shen Bao, Lawyer Xu Shihao, March 9.</p>
<p>To the Editor, I recently read a news item in your newspaper that the Social Bureau convened a mediation yesterday and a decision has been made regarding the wages of silversmiths' off-site workers this year. Last year's wages could not be mediated due to the firm attitudes of the three parties. After investigation, the representatives attending the meeting on behalf of this association have not yet recognized the amount of wages for this year. The news is inconsistent with the facts and should be corrected by your newspaper. Sincerely, To the Editor of Shen Bao, Shanghai Silversmiths' Trade Union, March 9.</p>
<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3>Regarding Literature Learning Steps, Writing and Other Matters</h3>
<p>丨General Answer to Messrs. Wang Qilun, Chen Ziyuan, Guo Jingwu, Jin XX, etc.</p>
<p>Recently, we have received many letters inquiring about the learning steps of literature, writing and other scattered questions that are of concern to beginners who are very enthusiastic about literature. The senders are either workers or shop assistants, and they are all young. According to their letters, two or three of them have attended junior high school, but dropped out due to family financial difficulties. The situation of the rest is even worse, they have only received elementary school education. Forced by poverty, they cannot obtain the educational opportunities they deserve, so they run out of school to participate in social production. The busyness of work, even if they want to attend night school for remedial studies, is not allowed by time and circumstances. However, relying on their self-study efforts, judging from their letters, the fluency and clarity of their writing is not necessarily inferior to that of ordinary college students, or even better. This makes us ashamed, enough to break the general discrimination against the cultural ability of the masses; but at the same time, it also makes us realize the important significance of our work: to improve the cultural level of the masses, and to cultivate and promote writers who are truly their own from their midst. This work is not only possible, but also necessary.</p>
<p>They doubt their own abilities, they hover, groping for the way forward. We have said several times that ability can be improved through self-study, and it is not necessary to enter school to cultivate it. At the same time, we have also cited many famous figures in literary history as examples. In fact, why do we need to look far for examples? Just look back at your own progress in self-study, can't you go forward bravely? The achievements of each stage are waiting for you.</p>
<p>We are not literary scholars, we are also groping for the way forward just like you. However, in this process, perhaps our knowledge is a little more than yours, and a little clearer. Regarding the inquiries, we hereby humbly offer our opinion for your consideration.</p>
<p>Let's first discuss the learning steps. Mr. Wang's proposed plan is divided into three stages: the first stage, "read more works of literary value on the one hand, and practice writing more on the other hand; "the second stage: when" the first stage "has a considerable foundation, then start studying Chinese literature"; the third stage is to study Western literature. Mr. Guo's proposed plan is: to obtain a systematic understanding of literary theory as the first stage, to seek a deeper exploration of literary theory, and to study creative methods and works as the second stage; to continue the theoretical and work studies and begin the study of social sciences as the third stage. Here, Mr. Guo also made an accompanying statement that his original intention was only to study literature, and he would only read social science books if possible. This view is the same as that of another reader, Mr. Pan. He has read many literary books and wants to devote himself to literature, but now he also wants to read some social science books, fearing that he will not succeed in both if he is distracted.</p>
<p>We feel that there are many shortcomings in the learning steps proposed by Mr. Wang and Mr. Guo, both in principle and in practical application. First, both gentlemen, especially Mr. Wang, completely ignore the necessity of understanding social sciences for the appreciation, research and creation of literature. We know that literature is a department of art, and art is a reflection of the times and society, and implies the author's understanding and hope for the times and society in which they are located, expressed in concrete images. In this way, without a correct understanding of social sciences such as economics, political science, sociology, psychology?…etc. as the foundation, it is simply impossible to obtain a complete understanding of the appreciation and research of literature. If we do not have social sciences to help us fight for social understanding, then our creation will become empty in content and become a hodgepodge and game of literature. It is true that in the past, and even today, there are many hodgepodges and games of words that are popular without any so-called content, playing their "helpful idler" role. But these are just foam on the surface of the water, and will be swept away by the torrent of the times without a trace. We busy people should not follow those decadent idlers to play with literature by selling air and buying air. We should use literature as our horn to call out our wishes for society, and also to awaken busy people like us. Only by doing this can we be true to the meaning of being a literary scholar, and only by doing this will we not be left behind. To do this, we can say that our idea of ​​being a literary scholar is noble. Therefore, studying social sciences is a necessary condition, and it cannot be said to be a distraction. Only by working hand in hand with social sciences can we expect considerable achievements in literary research and creation. Second, Mr. Wang's first step of the plan is to read more works of literary value on the one hand and practice writing more on the other hand, which is impeccable and better than Mr. Guo's starting with the exploration of literary theory, because literary theory involves general works to some extent. If you have not read some works first, you will not have a deep understanding of literary theory; what's more, literary theory is based on the methods of social sciences, but Mr. Guo puts the research of social sciences on the butt of the last stage. But Mr. Wang's so-called first stage, we feel, is necessary for every stage. Works are coming to your face inexhaustibly; and articles are not a limited period of time, and can reach the realm of perfection. In fact, articles never reach the realm of perfection. Third, Mr. Wang's so-called second stage starts to study Chinese literature, and the third stage studies Western literature, which probably refers to the exploration of history. Otherwise, just flipping through the works is simply driving the second and third stages into the scope of the first stage. But the study of literary history must have a deep foundation, and cannot ignore the exploration of general theory. Mr. Wang's plan is too broad and too empty, and it is not easy to start with. The result will still fall into a state of random collision. In this regard, Mr. Guo's plan is actually better than Mr. Wang's, and more in line with practical application. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Scoto Cup at Stake, Donghua vs. Western Concession Police Finals Today</h3>
<p>At 3 pm at Shenyuan Football Field</p>
<p>The two teams are evenly matched and have equal chances</p>
<p>Tomorrow Yuyou vs. Jewish Finals for Junior Cup</p>
<p>The Scoto Cup football final between Donghua and the Western Concession Police will be held at Shenyuan at 3 pm today. Donghua has had a smooth journey in the Scoto Cup, without any setbacks. The Western Concession Police, on the other hand, unexpectedly defeated Huacesi 2-0 and won the right to compete with Donghua in the final. Huacesi had eliminated French Business School 6-5, and in the minds of the general public, Huacesi was considered the most promising team. The Western Concession Police has been aggressive recently, having defeated the Western Business School in the Group A match and recently defeated Huacesi in the cup match. Their defense line is better than Donghua's. Judging by the forwards, Donghua is faster, so the chances are equal and it is impossible to predict the outcome. Donghua has a slight advantage. Since the Scoto Cup was established, Chinese people have never won it. I wonder if they can fulfill their long-cherished wish today. Today's referee is Li Nuosi, and the linesmen are He Chunhui and A Qiaosheng. Tomorrow Yuyou and Jewish will compete in the finals for the Yongji Cup at the baseball field.</p>

<h3>Wang Zhengting Talks</h3>
<p>Wang Zhengting, a director of the National Sports Promotion Association, took the Pingpu Express to Beijing and then to Shanghai at 5:35 pm today (the 8th). The reporter met with Wang at the station. According to Wang, he originally planned to come to Ping after the Sports Promotion Association meeting, but due to busy work, he came to Ping in advance. This trip to participate in the Sports Promotion Association is to discuss various issues related to China's participation in the Far Eastern Games. Among them, the method of pre-selection for Chinese athletes to participate in the Far Eastern Games, the hiring of instructors, and the funding issue are particularly important. He will accompany the athletes to the Philippines in early May. Although sports in China have made progress in recent years, there are still few opportunities to compete internationally. This participation in the Far Eastern Games is one of the international competitions. He hopes that the athletes will work hard and win glory for the motherland. China College is conducting fundraising to investigate the addresses of graduate students and plans fundraising methods. The College of Science is planning to expand. He will purchase British, German, and French instruments in Shanghai to meet the needs.

<h3>Manchurian Athletes</h3>
<p>Professors, instructors, and athletes from Peiping and the Northeast are actively opposing the puppet Manchurian state's request to participate in the Far Eastern Games.

<h3>Bai Hong Annual Publication</h3>
<p>The Bai Hong Track and Field Team publishes an annual publication every year, which contains practice methods, postures, photos, and records of the year for team members to refer to. There are also a large number of people from other track and field enthusiasts who send letters requesting to read it.

The whole book is about 120,000 words, with dozens of posture photos, and also includes Mr. Xue Xuehai's "Qinghua Record of the 1933 World Track and Field Championships", Mr. Sun Yunzhang's "Bird's-Eye View of the Next Far Eastern Games", and Mr. Tan Bangjie's "This Year's Track and Field Games", all of which are extremely valuable works.

Those that do not meet the stipulated standards shall abolish the bureau and merge it into a section, and establish a county school inspectorate under the county government to handle educational administration. In the bandit suppression area, due to the tightening of financial resources, there are also those who are abolished. In total, there are twenty-seven counties in the province that have established education bureaus, and thirty-five counties that have established county school inspectorates without education bureaus. In addition, most of the counties have been reduced to bandit areas, and education has come to a standstill. Now, in accordance with the special education implementation plan in the bandit suppression area, we are assisting various bandit suppression troops in carrying out the plan in earnest. According to the statistics of the 20th year, the total county education funding in the province is only 740,000 yuan. According to the statistics of the 21st year, the total local education funding for primary schools in the provincial capital and various counties and towns in the province is only 1,688,270 yuan and 3 dimes. The most is for elementary education in the provincial capital, 318,044 yuan and 8 jiao. The least is for Le'an County, only 600 yuan. Therefore, the local education funding in Jiangxi Province is extremely depleted. It is heard that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek will allocate huge funds to expand local education in Jiangxi Province.</p>
<h3>Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund Board Discusses and Decides to Recruit Students to Study Abroad in Peiping</h3>
<p>According to the early request from Nankai University and other schools in Peiping and Tianjin, the Ministry of Education forwarded a request to the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund Board to hold this year's overseas student examination and to set up examination venues in both Beijing and Peiping to facilitate the examinees. The Ministry of Education forwarded the request to the board for verification. Yesterday, the board replied that the matter of setting up examination venues in Peiping and the city should be submitted to the Education Committee of the board for discussion and decision. After receiving the board's reply, the Ministry of Education instructed Nankai and other schools to check and follow up.</p>

<p>Ceremony Order: (1) Opening (Music); (2) Singing the Party Song; (3) Saluting the Party Flag, National Flag, and the portrait of the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen; (4) Reading the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will; (5) Chairman's speech; (6) Presentation and acceptance of the tower; (7) Mayor's reply; (8) Singing the Boy Scout song; (9) Cheers; (10) Photography; (11) Ceremony complete (Music).</p>
<h3>Wu Tiecheng Appointed President of China Public School</h3>
<p>Ding Mocun Denies Appointment as Vice President</p>
<p>Since Xiong Kewu resigned as President of China Public School, the school affairs have been lacking a responsible person for a long time. The school students and alumni association have visited the school board members in Shanghai, such as Yu Youren and Cai Yuanpei, requesting them to select a president and revitalize the alma mater. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that the school board has appointed Wu Tiecheng as the president. The students and alumni association have expressed their sincere welcome. It is heard that the school will officially open in the near future. The school address is temporarily at Jiangwan Cultural College. As for the Wusong campus, there are also plans to revitalize it. Regarding the report that Ding Mocun will be the vice president, Ding told the Shanghai News reporter that China Public School was founded by the senior comrades of our party and occupies a very important page in the history of the party. After a long period of painstaking management in the past, the achievements and scale have been remarkable. However, due to the January 28th Incident, the good foundation was mostly destroyed. Fortunately, the responsible people have always been tireless and have established a revitalization committee to strive for revitalization. Looking forward to the future, it is still very optimistic. However, due to the resignation of President Xiong, the current term has not yet started, which is a pity. The school board members, in order to promote school affairs and actively develop the school, have indeed asked Mayor Wu to be a school board member and兼任the president, which is likely to become a reality. As for himself, he has been undertaking other kinds of work in recent years and has no more time to spare, and education is not his forte. The rumors that he will be the vice president are not true.</p>

<h3>Zhu Xin, the New Director of the County Education Bureau, Takes Office</h3>
<p>No Changes in Staff</p>
<p>The provincial government has issued an announcement that Zhu Changling, the school inspector of the Shanghai County Education Bureau, will succeed him. However, former Director Shi needs to recuperate due to illness and entrusted Zhu to act as the agent of the bureau's affairs from the 1st of this month. After the provincial department ordered Zhu to be the director, former Director Shi has transferred the seal, documents, account books, silver funds, etc. for receipt. There are no changes in the staff of the bureau. It is found that Director Zhu's courtesy name is Han Ge, he is 46 years old, a native of Shanghai County, and a graduate of Jiangnan Higher School. He has served as a teacher in primary and secondary schools for 18 years, and was appointed as the school inspector of this county in the 17th year of the Republic.</p>
<h3>Soochow University Shanghai Alumni Association Held Its Annual Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Over 300 People Attended, Including Liu Zhanen</p>
<p>Organizing a Club and Re-electing Officials</p>
<p>The three colleges of literature, science, and law of Soochow University and the entire alumni association of the former Boxi Middle School held a tea party at the school's club in the mainland market at 4:00 PM on the 8th of this month, and held an annual meeting at the Central Western Restaurant at 6:00 PM in the afternoon. Zhou Zepu, Sun Xiaolou, Xue Guangqian, and others were responsible for the reception. Dr. Yang Yongqing, President of the school, Dr. Ge Lai, former President, Bei Songsun, President of the Alumni Association, Chen Tingrui, Vice President, Sun Bosheng, Chairman of the Board of Directors of China East Bank, Wei Tingtao, Vice President of the Bank of Communications and Director of the Central Mint, Liu Zhanen, President of Hujiang University, Lu Ganchen, General Secretary of the YMCA, Yang Fusheng, Ni Zheng Ao, Cha Liangjian, Jiang Yiping, Lu Dingkui, Hu Yibao, Xue Guangqian, Sun Zuji, Jiang Pingfan, Huang Hui, Li Defu, and others, over 300 people, attended. After Chairman Bei Songsun gave an opening speech, they had dinner and performed entertainment. During the meeting, President Yang reported on the situation of the three colleges of literature, science, and law of Soochow University, as well as administrative instructions. Recently, a biological material institute was established to manufacture various biological specimens for domestic and foreign reference. Last year, the sales price was over 13,000 yuan. Recently, the research and manufacture of human skeleton models has been established, and five sets have been established, which can be said to be the first in the country. It is now planned to raise 300,000 yuan to build a law library, and to set up a union and alumni guidance center. Then, Dr. Ge Lai En, the former president, gave a speech. Vice President Chen Tingrui and Qian Zhongdao reported on the progress of organizing the club. Then, the officials were re-elected. The elected officials were: President Bei Songsun, Vice President Chen Tingrui, Secretary Lu Ganchen, Accountant Qian Zhongdao, Executive Directors Sun Zuji, Shen Tilan, Shi Naixiu, Li Caixia, Wu Peng. Finally, the club committee members were elected. It was not until after 10 o'clock that they dispersed with joy.</p>
<h3>The Bureau of Public Works Considers Increasing Tuition Fees for Various Schools</h3>
<p>The Chief of the Finance Department of the Bureau of Public Works recently submitted a memorandum to the Education Committee, stating that the expenses of the Bureau of Public Works schools have always been borne separately by the parents of the students and the taxpayers. As for the proportion of their respective responsibilities, a principle was established several years ago that the tuition fees collected should account for one-third. To this day, the bureau's middle schools generally maintain this proportion, but if one were to investigate, it can be seen that this method actually makes the benefits received by the general parents far exceed the amount they bear. For example, suppose there is a foreigner A, who has two children in school, and pays a total of about 312 yuan in tuition fees per year. At the same time, the education fee borne by the donation tax on his behalf is 624 yuan. Suppose this person's monthly rent is 140 yuan, and the total donation paid per year is only 235 yuan and 2 jiao. Suppose there is a Chinese B, who has two children in the bureau's middle school, and pays about 153 yuan and 6 jiao in tuition fees per year, then the education fee paid by the donation tax on his behalf is about 307 yuan and 2 jiao. If this person's monthly rent is 80 yuan, then the total donation paid per year is only 134 yuan. From this point of view, the parents of the upper class not only have to have their education expenses supplemented by donation taxes, but also do not actually bear any of the other municipal expenses.</p>
<p>In other countries, the cost of education is borne by the public, but the situation in the Bureau of Public Works is different. The Bureau of Public Works does not have the right to compulsory education, and the children attending the bureau's schools are only a very small part of the school-age children in the boundary. In this way, a small number of citizens are obviously enjoying special preferential benefits that are borne by others, and most of the poor Chinese citizens are difficult to enjoy the convenience of this education.</p>
<p>The tuition fees of the bureau's schools are also related to non-bureau schools. The Bureau of Public Works encourages residents of various countries to run schools on their own, but the bureau's school fees are too low, which has an impact on competition with other schools. In view of the above reasons, the Chief of the Finance Department advocated that this issue should be considered immediately, so that the bureau's schools can uniformly increase tuition fees. After discussion by the Education Committee, it was considered extremely important and the memorandum has been copied and presented to the directors for review and published for public consideration.</p>
<h3>Art Specialty Exhibition Closes Yesterday</h3>
<p>Ye Gongchuo, Chen Lifu, and Others Visited</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Highly Praised All Exhibits</p>
<p>The fourth exhibition held by the National Hangzhou Art College at No. 11 Huanlong Road concluded as scheduled yesterday (the 9th) at 5 p.m. A total of over 560 pieces were exhibited this time. Among them, the oil paintings of Lin Fengmian, Wu Dayu, and Cai William, the traditional Chinese paintings of Qi Baishi, Pan Tianshou, and Li Kuchan, and the sculptures of Liu Kaiqu, as well as the decorative paintings of Lei Kuiyuan and his top students, were most praised by the audience. Over the week, the total number of visitors exceeded 13,000. Cai Yuanpei, Chen Lifu, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Shizhao, Liu Weijun, Ye Gongchuo, Shen Yimo, Xu Langxi, Weng Zhilong, Lin Wojiang, Li Dachao, Lin Bin, the French Consul-General Meriel, the President of the French Literary Society Li Rong, the President of the International Art Association, and others visited the exhibition one after another. Mayor Wu praised the various exhibits most vigorously. In addition, major art magazines and pictorials in this city, such as Liangyou Pictorial, Dazhong Wenhuat Times Art Magazine, Art Life, Zhonghua Youbao, Shenbao Pictorial, Zhonghua Tuhua Zazhi, and Wenxueshe, also came to the exhibition to take photographs and requested to retain dozens of exhibits for use in producing three-color versions. By the end of the exhibition, numerous verbal and written requests for extending the exhibition period were still being received. However, due to funding and time constraints, the association was unable to extend the exhibition any further and had already packed the exhibits separately in preparation for returning to Hangzhou.</p>

<h3>Various Ways of "Setting Up"</h3>
<p>— Shen Shouruo</p>
<p>The word "set up," when carefully examined, distinctly reveals the opposition between the two major classes of "laborers" and "aristocrats." It also allows one to appreciate that while there are differences in hardship, toil, and ease within the same act of setting up, the inherent risks do not vary accordingly.</p>
<p>In order to sustain a miserable life and prolong existence in harsh environments, one has no choice but to set up a stall to earn meager profits, barely enough to feed oneself or one's entire family. However, one often faces unexpected and severe interference, preventing the stable operation of the stall that sustains one's livelihood. With no other option, one must endure the pain and adopt a mobile approach, setting up here and there like engaging in clandestine activities. The heart sways restlessly like a pendulum.</p>
<p>Risking one's life in the dangerous swaying ferry across the Huangpu River is nothing more than an attempt to earn a few coins to buy food and nourish the five viscera. But how terrifying it is! The river surface is teeming with large ships like whales opening their giant mouths. A moment of carelessness could result in the small sampan being swallowed up at any time. Moreover, there might be unforeseen disasters; a sudden gust of wind could arise in the center of the river, and then the fate of the ferryman would be uncertain.</p>
<p>Setting up an official, grandiose, and seemingly inviolable facade forces those who worship such facades to bow deeply. At that moment, one not only feels both triumphant and carefree, but even those benevolent individuals who despise posturing, while cursing you, actually contribute to your aristocratic grandeur by stimulating the nerves of the blindly obedient. However, one must be careful not to overdo the facade, lest the structure collapse under its own weight.</p>
<p>The more items displayed on the table, the more extravagant the scene appears. However, I believe that those who are truly wealthy should feel free to display lavishly and extravagantly. Even if it leads to financial ruin, it could be seen as a form of social relief (because directly begging for help from those who cannot even afford the basic necessities of life is, of course, rarely granted). Conversely, those who lack the means but wish to create an illusion of grandeur may receive temporary praise as "young masters," but they must be cautious; hoodlums and thugs are often the veterans of such "young master" lifestyles.</p>
<h3>Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast Army</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twenty-Five: Tears Stream Down as a Woman Bids Farewell to Her Family to Serve in the Distant Borderlands; Throughout the Night, They March Out to Garrison a Lonely City</p>
<p>"Before, they said we only consumed grain without contributing to the nation. This time, we are finally serving the Republic of China, but we are still eating cornbread and drinking ice water." Ziqiang smiled and said, "We officers are considered fortunate; we even have an earthen platform to sleep on." Just as he was speaking, there was a rustling sound from the room next door. It turned out that it was a larger room, covered with straw on the ground, where the soldiers were all sleeping. Their movements caused the straw to rustle. Ziqiang said, "More than ten days ago, the battalion commander said we could receive wartime supplies. Why haven't they arrived yet after all this time?" Guan Yaowu said, "Who knows? Now, the whole country is saying that we are a non-resistance army, perhaps because of that. I curse the people who say we are not resisting! Why don't they come to the northeast and resist? If they only came here and tasted this hardship!" As he spoke, he stomped his foot forcefully on the ground. Ziqiang laughed and said, "Old Guan, why are you complaining?" Before he could reply, there was a loud crash, and dust from the roof of the room rained down like chaff. Guan Yaowu, being an experienced veteran, had already jumped out of the room. Ziqiang, fearing something unexpected had happened, immediately drew his pistol from its holster and followed him outside. Then they heard someone shouting, "The wind has blown down the house!" Zhao Ziqiang calmed himself down, recalling that the sound did indeed seem like a house collapsing. He immediately stood outside the door of the soldiers' quarters, suppressing any commotion. After a short while, there was another loud crash, and several more houses collapsed. Listening to the wind in the sky, sometimes roaring for a long time, sometimes howling, it continued to intensify. During a march, especially when encountering unexpected weather, it is crucial to maintain vigilance to prevent accidents. The battalion commander had already issued orders to increase precautions. Wang Shili walked up to Ziqiang and said in a low voice, "Company commander, the house you are staying in is also creaking and groaning. I'm afraid it will collapse. We must be extra careful tonight." (332)</p>
<h3>Nanjing Road Thirty Years Ago</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>Nanjing Road, which is now the first major road in the British Concession, is known to anyone who has visited Shanghai for its prosperity and liveliness. The towering buildings on both sides are like distant jade palaces and lofty green cities, while the vehicles moving east and west in the middle are like shuttles weaving back and forth day and night. Shanghai is hardly a major city in the world, but in China, it is like Venice or Florence in medieval Italy! It began as a mere commercial gathering, but gradually developed countless related historical events.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago, the most famous section of Nanjing Road extended from the Bund Park in the east to the Bowling Green in the west. Beyond that, weeds grew wild, white poplars rustled in the wind, few people traveled there, and distinguished guests rarely visited. The "Rainbow Temple" was just a dilapidated building, and aside from the old women who burned incense and candles, there were few young women dressed in finery, accompanied by teenage girls, kneeling at the feet of the Buddhas. The "British Municipal Council" was located in Pintang Lane, but its authority was not as extensive or strict as it is today. It is said that when "Zuo Zongtang" was transferring troops to Zhejiang, he led several thousand soldiers through Shanghai, still armed with rifles, marching directly along Nanjing Road. The foreigners not only dared not interfere but also had to salute them!</p>
<p>The most famous and earliest-established theater in Shanghai was "Sanya Garden," located near today's Wing On Department Store. One day, the strongman "Ma Yongzhen" performed there, and the ticket price, which was originally only ten cents, was increased to forty cents, which was considered unprecedented. Later, Ma was killed by a horse dealer at "Yidongtian," located in Daxin Street, to the left of Wankang Sauce Garden before the revolution. A corner of the small building still remained, with the inscription "Yidongtian." North of Nicheng Bridge was the "Foreign Affairs Bureau." Whenever the Shanghai Daotai went out of the city to attend to matters at the bureau, he would pass through Nanjing Road, riding in a carriage, preceded by a mounted military officer, flanked by guards, and followed by two attendants on horseback, making a grand procession through the city. The scenic spot "Yangliu Loutai" was founded by the first person to create the "Youxi Bao" newspaper, named "Xiangfu," a grandson of Yuan Zicai, who used the pseudonym "Yangliu Loutai Master." Now, I fear no one remembers him. In the racecourse, there was also a "stone archway," a relic that a certain family had not sold to foreigners. In the past, descendants would come to sweep the tombs during Qingming, but now, I fear they are scattered and lost. Who knows if the spirits of their ancestors are still watching over them! "North of the Racecourse" and "East of Longfei Horse Stable" was a tall Western-style building with a teahouse called "Zhezhe Lou" on the upper floor. Its owner was a Cantonese named "Shi Dezhi." Few people could understand the meaning of the two words "Zhezhe," because they were inscribed by the famous "Wo Fo Shanren," and were therefore extraordinary. In fact, they meant "The benevolent see benevolence, the wise see wisdom." Once explained, everyone understood!</p>
<p>Just recalling Nanjing Road has made me feel as if I have experienced great changes, all like a dream. What more can I say? It shows that the singing stages and dance pavilions of today may become overgrown with weeds in the future, and the drunken revelry of tonight may end up in a three-inch coffin!</p>
<h3>Handshake and Bow</h3>
<p>— Li Taoan</p>
<p>There are many differences between Western and Chinese etiquette. For example, when people in Europe and America meet, they shake hands to show intimacy, but in our ancient country, it is somewhat different, with people cupping their hands and bowing deeply to each other. (Although some modern people have already changed this.)</p>
<p>In fact, this is just a superficial politeness, and there is nothing really important about it. However, a friend said that from this very small occasion, one can see the differences in the expressions of various national characteristics. Foreigners are more unified and communal, so everyone becomes one when they meet. Speaking of ourselves, we have always boasted of the old saying "Each sweeps the snow from his own doorstep, and cares not for the frost on others' roofs," so when we meet each other, we merely cup our hands and bow from a distance.</p>
<p>But I believe that this statement is just a humorous anecdote. If it were true, it would not only be insulting to our own people, but it would also be very unfair to them.</p>

<h3>The Most Economical Vacuum Tube Tester</h3>
<p>— Guo Yongnian</p>
<p>A vacuum tube tester is an instrument for testing whether various vacuum tubes can work under normal conditions. Ready-made products may not be available domestically; even if they are, the price will certainly be exorbitantly high, beyond the reach of the average person. This article introduces a simple and economical version. Small-scale radio research groups or individual hobbyists should all make one to have a definite judgment on the quality of vacuum tubes when building or repairing radios. The components shown in the diagram are explained below:</p>
<p>Filament Transformer: Used with 110V AC power. The core is made of one-inch wide silicon steel sheets stacked to a thickness of one inch in a "mountain" shape. The primary winding uses No. 28 enameled wire wound 660 turns. The secondary winding uses No. 16 enameled wire wound a total of 45 turns, with taps at the 9th, 15th, 18th, 30th, and 45th turns, providing five different filament voltages: 1.5V, 2.5V, 3V, 5V, and 7.5V. The lead wires are connected to terminal posts. Adjacent terminal posts must be far apart, or an un wired terminal post should be installed between two wired ones to prevent the switch from simultaneously contacting two terminal posts when changing the voltage. Otherwise, the secondary winding may easily burn out. Each terminal should be labeled with its respective voltage to prevent errors. A is a milliampere meter, with a range of 0-10 mA being sufficient.</p>
<p>Rl is a shunt resistor for A, and by closing SW·r, one can know that a current three times larger than the indication of A is passing through. The resistance value is 900 ohms.</p>
<p>R2 is a 50-ohm center-tapped resistor.</p>
<p>R3 is a 500-ohm resistor that generates a 1.5V C voltage.</p>
<p>R4 has 3500 ohms. Together with R3, it can generate a 4-volt C voltage. The remaining two are an X-type four-pin tube socket and a Y-type five-pin tube socket.</p>
<p>The first time it is used, various known vacuum tubes that can serve as standards should be plugged into this tester, the power turned on, and the filament voltage adjusted. First close SW2, then release it, and the maximum and minimum values can be read on the meter. After each type of vacuum tube has been tested in this way, a table can be created, and the numbers in this table can be used as a basis for judgment in the future.</p>
<p>Highest Reading 668810941058</p>
<p>Lowest Reading 2122221212</p>
<p>Vacuum Tube -10-27-26-71-12-45-99-80-24-22</p>
<p>The attached table is for several common vacuum tubes, which readers can use as a reference. For No. 71 and 80, SW·I must be closed to prevent excessive current from passing through A. The same applies to all vacuum tubes with high plate current. For tetrodes such as No. 24, an additional base must be added to make the connector shown in Figure 2. When in use, plug the lamp holder of the connector into the lamp holder of the tester, plug the vacuum tube into the lamp holder of the connector, and clamp the steel sheet onto the G pole on the top of the vacuum tube to test in the same way.</p>
<h3>Talking About Batteries for Radios</h3>
<p>— Ming Xiang</p>
<p>For DC radios, the power supply almost entirely relies on batteries. Batteries that cannot be restored after being used up are called primary cells. Those that can be charged with external power to restore their function are called secondary cells or storage cells. Primary cells include the commonly used dry batteries, as well as the newly introduced air cells. Storage cells also have lead-acid and Edison types. Here is a brief explanation of each:</p>
<p>Dry Batteries: Dry batteries are not really dry. Their construction is as follows: A carbon rod in the center serves as the positive electrode, and a cylindrical zinc can on the outside serves as the negative electrode. The two electrodes are separated by a mixture of manganese dioxide and other anti-depolarizing agents, as well as water-absorbing paper separators, all soaked in a solution of zinc chloride and ammonium chloride to initiate a chemical reaction. Each cell has a voltage of 1.5 volts. If they are used to supply the A voltage for lighting the filaments of radios, several can be connected in series, and a bleeder resistor can be used to adjust it to match the filament voltage of the vacuum tubes. However, their capacity is limited and they cannot be restored, so it is best to use the storage batteries mentioned below for radios with a total filament current of more than half an ampere, which is more economical. Many small dry batteries can also be combined to provide the B voltage for the plate power of vacuum tubes.</p>
<p>Air Cells: This type of battery is named because its anti-depolarizing agent directly obtains oxygen from the surrounding air. Each cell has a voltage of about 2.5 volts when first used and a very large capacity of 600 ampere-hours, making it most suitable for supplying the filaments of 2-volt vacuum tubes (such as 230, 232, 233, etc.). However, its discharge rate cannot exceed 0.75 amperes, and it is also more expensive, so it is not widely seen in the Chinese market.</p>
<p>Lead-Acid Storage Batteries: These batteries use lead electrodes immersed in a dilute sulfuric acid solution with a specific gravity of 1.280. An external DC current is then passed through, entering from the positive lead electrode and exiting from the negative electrode, causing the active material of the positive electrode (i.e., the material that initiates the chemical reaction) to become brown lead dioxide and the negative electrode to become bluish-gray spongy lead. A fully charged battery has a voltage of about 2.2 volts. Storage batteries for providing the A voltage to radios are connected in series with three cells to form a battery with a voltage of 6 volts and a capacity of about 60 ampere-hours to 200 ampere-hours. Connecting many lead-acid storage batteries with very small capacities in series to serve as the B voltage for radios is also very suitable, because they can be revived by external power after being used up, making them inexhaustible and particularly economical. However, managing and carrying them is more troublesome.</p>
<p>Edison Batteries: Invented by Thomas Edison, their construction is roughly similar to that of lead-acid batteries, but all containers, electrodes, etc., are made of cast steel. The active material of the positive electrode is nickel hydroxide, the negative electrode is iron oxide, and the electrolyte is a dilute solution of potassium hydroxide. When the battery is fully charged, each cell has a voltage of about 1.2 volts. Their special advantages are that they are sturdy and durable. Even if they are short-circuited, shelved, or shaken, their lifespan will not be reduced, and they are light in weight and have low maintenance costs, but because they are very expensive, they are not very popular.</p>
<h3>A Powerful Single-Tube Radio Using a 33 Detector</h3>
<p>— Wang Fumin</p>
<p>In ordinary radios, triodes or tetrodes are mostly used for detection, but now we can also use a low-frequency power pentode for detection. Do you find it amazing? Using it to make a one-tube radio can indeed surpass everything. Circuits of this kind have also been published in other radio publications. The circuit introduced here is similar to others, but an additional variable condenser and coil L3 are added next to L4, which can increase the selectivity of the radio. The required parts are listed below:</p>
<p>L1: Use a 30mm diameter bakelite tube and wind 50 turns of No. 26 double cotton-covered wire. It must be able to change its inductance.</p>
<p>L1L2L3L4: Use a 30mm diameter bakelite tube and wind No. 26 double cotton-covered wire. First wind 10 turns for L1, then 55 turns for L2, then 45 turns for L4. The three coils are separated by 8.2mm.</p>
<p>L3: Wind 50 turns of the same wire on the outside of L4. The two coils must be separated by insulation.</p>
<p>C3: 0.00045 mfd variable condenser</p>
<p>C: 0.00045 mfd variable condenser</p>
<p>Cl: 0.00025 mfd fixed condenser</p>
<p>R: 3 megolun fixed resistor</p>
<p>C2: 0.00035mfd mica or variable condenser</p>
<p>Use a storage battery for the A voltage, because the 33 filament consumes 0.26 amperes, which is very power-consuming. The B voltage can be gradually tested from 45 volts to 90 volts to see which voltage produces the loudest sound.</p>
<h3>Philips Shortwave Broadcasting</h3>
<p>The Philips shortwave broadcasting test station, with a wavelength of 38 meters, will broadcast speeches by Mayor Wu and Minister Kong tomorrow from 1:30 PM to 2:00 PM at the New Municipal Government. The Da Zhonghua Radio Station, with a wavelength of 258 meters, will receive and rebroadcast on longwave. All parts of China can receive the broadcast. Those who have radios are encouraged to pay attention to receiving the broadcast at that time to listen to the insightful discussions.</p>
<h3>On Capacitors</h3>
<p>— Meng Cheng</p>
<p>The capacitor is one of the most important components in electrical instruments, and an indispensable part of radio circuits. In radios, whether it is an amplifier, detector, rectifier, oscillator, or crystal radio circuit, capacitors must be connected in order to be effective.</p>
<p>Two conductors separated by an insulator and not connected form a capacitor, because if a voltage is applied between the two plates, a considerable amount of charge will be stored on the two plates after a very short time. Two wires separated by a few centimeters in the air also form a capacitor, because air is an insulator. When a voltage is applied, charge is stored on the wires, but the amount of charge stored at this time is very small and generally not noticed. The insulator between the conductors is specifically called the dielectric, and air, waxed paper, mica, and oils are all good and commonly used dielectrics.</p>
<p>The resistance of a capacitor to alternating current is inversely proportional to the frequency of the alternating current. Direct current can be said to be a special case of alternating current, with its frequency being zero, so the resistance of a capacitor to direct current is infinite. In other words, direct current cannot pass through a capacitor, and a capacitor can separate alternating current and direct current. Because the resistance is inversely proportional to the frequency, a capacitor can also separate high-frequency alternating current from low-frequency alternating current. The functions of bypass capacitors and filter capacitors are based on the above principles.</p>
<p>Capacitors are classified into two types according to their structure: fixed and variable. Fixed capacitors mostly use mica or oil paper as the dielectric, and variable capacitors mostly use air as the dielectric. According to their different functions in the radio, fixed capacitors are further divided into grid capacitors, bypass capacitors, and filter capacitors, etc. Grid capacitors are used for the temporary storage of electrons on the grid, and their capacitance is very small. Bypass capacitors are used to facilitate the flow of high-frequency currents, and their capacitance is relatively large, while filter capacitors are used to short-circuit low-frequency currents, and their capacitance is even larger. Variable capacitors are mostly used in tuning circuits, but some are also used to control oscillation. Their capacitance is always very small, about tens to hundreds of picofarads. There are also several identical variable capacitors combined on one axis for convenient tuning, called coaxial capacitors.</p>
<h3>On Loudspeakers</h3>
<p>— Zhu Ziyuan</p>
<p>A loudspeaker, commonly known as a horn or speaker, is a device that can emit sounds loud enough for many people to hear after receiving an audio current. They vary in type and construction. Here, let's briefly talk about a few common types.</p>
<p>The first type is the steel diaphragm loudspeaker. Its principle and construction are completely similar to those of a receiver, but all materials are enlarged to strengthen the electromagnetic force, causing the diaphragm to vibrate more violently, resulting in a louder sound. Adding a horn on top completes the assembly, as shown in Figure 1. M is a horseshoe-shaped permanent magnet. Coils Cr and C2 are wound with fine copper wire on the two magnetic poles S and N in series. The diaphragm is placed above the magnetic poles, with a very small gap in between. When a low-frequency current passes through these two coils, it generates a magnetic force of varying intensity depending on the strength of the current, which in turn affects the change in the magnetic force of the permanent magnet, causing the diaphragm above the magnet to vibrate up and down. The amplitude and speed of the vibration vary according to the strength of the magnetic force, and the surrounding air is agitated to produce sound.</p>
<p>In this type of loudspeaker, the distance between the diaphragm and the magnetic poles is extremely difficult to adjust properly. If it is too close, the diaphragm will easily come into contact with the magnetic poles and produce noise when the sound is loud. If it is too far, faint sounds cannot be heard. Moreover, its effectiveness varies for different frequencies, and there is often the disadvantage of having a resonant frequency, resulting in an excessively high sound at a certain frequency. Therefore, there are now very few users of this type.</p>
<p>When using this type of loudspeaker, pay attention to the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Do not use strong shocks.</p>
<p>(2) The positive and negative terminals should not be connected in reverse (connect the colored wire to B+).</p>
<p>(3) Do not allow dust to enter the speaker.</p>
<p>(4) Prevent moisture.</p>
<p>(5) The distance between the magnetic poles and the diaphragm must be adjusted.</p>
<p>The second type is the so-called balanced-armature loudspeaker, which is an evolution of the steel-diaphragm loudspeaker. Its sensitivity is limited to high frequencies, and it avoids contact with the magnetic poles when the sound is loud. Its construction is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>A is a tongue made of soft iron, on the outside of which thousands of turns of fine copper wire are wound. It is then placed between the iron pieces in magnet D. When a low-frequency current passes through the coil, the tongue becomes magnetic. Due to the principles of like poles repelling and opposite poles attracting, the magnetic force of the permanent magnet alternately attracts and repels the tongue. The tongue vibrates left and right with M as the center (Figure 2). The rod B transmits this vibration to the diaphragm C, agitating the air to produce sound.</p>
<p>When using this type of loudspeaker, the position of the tongue must be in the center of the two poles to allow it to vibrate freely. The rest is the same as above.</p>
<p>The above two types are both electromagnetic loudspeakers. There is also a type called a dynamic loudspeaker, which is very popular on AC radios now. Its general construction is as follows:</p>
<h3>Direct Current Excitation - Output Transformer Connection</h3>
<p>A is wrought iron, B is the moving magnetic coil, D is the voice coil (also called the moving coil) connected to the diaphragm. The excitation coil is supplied with direct current (in AC radios, it is often used as a filtering choke coil). The voice coil is connected to the output transformer. When direct current flows through the excitation coil, the wrought iron becomes an electromagnet. At the same time, when a low-frequency current passes through the voice coil, it also becomes a magnetic field. Due to the interaction of the two magnetic fields, the voice coil vibrates. The strength of the vibration varies depending on the sound current and the excitation current. The excitation current is usually from tens of milliamperes to several amperes. Of course, if the excitation current is larger, better results can be obtained, but it is also necessary to estimate whether the excitation coil can withstand a larger current, otherwise it will heat up and burn out. After the voice coil is vibrated, because it is connected to the diaphragm C, the diaphragm is also vibrated, thus agitating the air to create sound.</p>
<p>When using this type of loudspeaker, if the DC voltage of the excitation coil is insufficient, the sound will be weak. If there is no sound, in addition to a break in the speaker wire or loose connections, a broken wire in the excitation coil should also be noted.</p>
<h3>A Collection of News</h3>
<p>Successful Ultra-Shortwave Communication Across the Strait: The British Lympne radio station and the French Saint Inglevert airfield radio station have begun formal communication using 17 and 19-meter ultra-short waves. The antenna used is directional, with a power of 500 watts. Both stations use teleprinters for automatic transmission and reception. It is said that there is absolutely no static interference with this wavelength. (One Knowledge)</p>
<p>World's First Successful Ultra-Shortwave Telephone: Ultra-shortwave telephone communication has been used between the Hawaiian Islands in the United States. This wave has been used by experimenters in various countries and has a length of about several meters, but it is not the microwave of 50 centimeters used by Marconi.</p>
<p>The Hawaiian Islands are located in a sea area with rapid currents, so in 1912, the Honolulu Telephone Bureau planned to use submarine cables to connect to the island, but failed due to the difficulty of the work. Afterwards, it used medium-length waves to communicate with the island, but due to the surrounding hot air and severe static interference, it was difficult to talk.</p>
<p>Since 1928, experimenters have used ultra-shortwave telephone communication. Last year, the telephone bureau had equipped transmitters and receivers to communicate with various islands. Users are connected from telephone lines to a switching exchange, and then transmitted by ultra-shortwave transmitters. This ultra-shortwave wireless telephone is very secret because the radio waves travel in a straight line, so the transmitter and receiver must use antennas in the same direction to receive it.

<h3>On the Detestable Nature of Laughter</h3>
<p>— Lin Yutang</p>
<p>This happened one night in a café. The reason was that Ya Xi had just returned from France. That evening, he heard his uncle, Xiangfu, praise the elegance and interest of the cafés on Avenue Joffre, speaking highly of them. To Ya Xi, it seemed that he was saying that the cafés in Paris were not good, which he resented. He defiantly invited his old classmate, Yu Jun, and his uncle to come with him. In Xiangfu's pronunciation, Ya Xi was pronounced somewhat peculiarly. To Lao Yu, it sounded like Ya Sai, and the word "Sai" seemed to be read in the first tone. When he was studying in France, he had spelled his name in four ways: Asen, Asay, Asailles, and Asaient, especially the last two, which he was most proud of. However, since a French girl called him Assez, his classmates also called him Ssez, and some translated it into Chinese, calling him "Enough." Still others translated it into classical Chinese, calling him "Alas." There were also students who had studied in England who came to visit Paris and called him Isay. However, Xiangfu, because he had been used to calling him A Sai since he was a child, still called him A Sai, and the word "Sai" was read in the first tone. Ya Xi had no choice but to say that he had recently returned to China and that his nickname was really not very pleasant. Ya Xi was his style name, but his uncle still did not think it was necessary to call his nephew by his style name.</p>
<p>The three of them were sitting at a table near mine. Ya Xi saw that there was a glass surface on the table and thought that Shanghai had indeed progressed in the few years he had been abroad, but he was not willing to praise domestic products easily.</p>
<p>"Look at that woman's permed hair, trying to imitate Paris, neither East nor West, it's really too humorous."</p>
<p>"Do you even understand this new term, 'humor'?" Lao Yu said.</p>
<p>"How could I not understand! I've read a few 'Analects' in Paris... What a joke! Chinese people don't understand humor at all!"</p>
<p>Xiangfu was originally also a moralist. He had always been against humor. But what he opposed was not buffoonery, but the Western term "humor," especially the use of the two words "Analects" as the name of a publication by modern people. He said that buffoonery and absurdity were harmless, and that it was harmless for literati to occasionally write some playful words as a pastime. He was against buffoonery that also spoke serious words, both solemn and humorous. He said that, for example, if a man wanted to visit a prostitute, he should go outside to do so. Is it appropriate to kiss and behave indecently with his own wife? Imagine if the wife at home also played the huqin, sang Peking opera, permed her hair, and dressed up flamboyantly, what a scandal it would be. He was very serious and upright at home, and the children at home could not see his romantic side. Therefore, he always looked at the "Analects" with a stern face, getting angrier the more he read, although he read it more and more angrily. The "Analects" has always been bought up by this group of people who are filled with righteous indignation and "look at it angrily"; Lao Yu's generation often cannot buy it, or if they do, it is confiscated by the old man at home. But at this moment, because Ya Xi was against it, he wanted to say a few good words for domestic products, because although Ya Xi had studied abroad, in his eyes, he was still A Sai, and the word "Sai" was read in the first tone.</p>
<p>"What's wrong with the 'Analects'?" Xiangfu said.</p>
<p>At this time, Uncle Xiangfu was in favor of humor, while Ya Xi had become a moralist; this alignment was a bit peculiar.</p>
<p>"Something like La Vie Parisienne is humorous, makes you laugh uncontrollably," I was looking at a picture in La Vie Parisienne at the time, a pair of women's legs placed on the bulging belly of a doughy rich man 丨丨 "That's that subtle, relaxed laughter of the Latin people. Just like this café, it makes you uncomfortable sitting here. When I was in Paris, I could sit in a café for half a day. I don't know why, it makes you feel that a toothy smile under a Latin mustache is appropriate. We Chinese people don't grow our mustaches well. Chinese laughter is also detestable."</p>
<p>Xiangfu had a mustache. Hearing these words, he glared at him sharply. Lao Yu saw that the situation was not good and quickly changed the subject.</p>
<p>"Ya Xi, I haven't been to Paris, but I've seen a lot of French mustaches on Avenue Joffre. I don't think it's that big a deal. I don't think that Westerners are necessarily so superior when they laugh, and Chinese people are necessarily so detestable. The 'Analects' also translated a piece of French humor called 'The Scholar and the Thief' in issue 28, which looks no different from the 'Collection of Jokes.' You're all just a bunch of dogmatic moralists."</p>
<p>"You're mistaken. It was published in issue 30 of the 'Analects,' not issue 28," said Ya Xi, who had just returned from studying in France. "I read it on the French mail ship Bordes on my way back from Europe."</p>
<p>"You're both wrong. 'The Scholar and the Thief' was in issue 26, published on October 1st. I happened to be going to Wuxi that day and bought it on the train. It was clearly October 1st, how could I be mistaken?"</p>
<p>I drank a large cup of coffee and left. In my heart, I was thinking: 28? 26? 30? I really couldn't remember clearly, and I wasn't even sure if issue 26 was published on October 1st. When I got home, I looked for my collection of books, but couldn't find it anywhere. I had issues 27 to 30, but none of them had that article "The Scholar and the Thief." Unfortunately, issue 26 was missing. I called the Times Company and asked them to send someone to deliver issue 26 immediately. The people at the Times were panicked, thinking that something had gone wrong with issue 26. I said, "Nothing, I'm just having a nervous breakdown. The people who are against it have remembered the issue numbers clearly, but I can't remember them. I wish everyone in the world was against humor."</p>
<p>"What!?" came a startled voice on the phone.</p>
<p>"Send someone to deliver issue 26 immediately," I abruptly hung up the phone.</p>
<h3>A Request for an Explanation of the Xu He Creation Issue</h3>
<p>— Liang Xin</p>
<p>There are always new things happening in the current "literary world," but most of them are not good things. The "plagiarism" and "cutting and pasting" cases are long gone, but the new year has brought the creative issue of Mr. He Jiahai. This issue seems to have been going on for quite a long time in other newspapers, but there have only been two mentions of it in this publication. But after reading Mr. Shi Heng's article, it is clear that this issue is not as simple as "cutting and pasting."</p>
<p>The scope of this issue is relatively large. The locations are Nanjing Houhu, Shanghai, and the hometown of Mr. Xu Zhuanpeng (I don't know where it is); the people involved are two protagonists, Shi Heng, "Cleaner," Chu Anping, Gao Zhi, Shen Congwen, Shi Zhicun, Shao Xunmei, Du Heng, and Mr. Cunren, making it a lively affair unprecedented in all previous cases. The evidence includes the owner's conversations, letters, the difference in writing style between He and Xu, and the original manuscripts that can be printed in the future, which is enough to go to the extreme.</p>
<p>Readers could have already made a conclusion. "Legal issues" will not succeed. Publishing it in the newspaper is just to tell the readers. However, Mr. Shi Heng's article, in addition to revealing the truth, also planted a doubt. He said: "However, Zhuanpeng has a different explanation, narrating the ins and outs, but without Zhuanpeng's permission, it is not convenient to disclose it now."</p>
<p>We know of two ways that people take other people's articles and claim them as their own. One is to copy other people's works and submit them to newspapers. We often see authors or readers subsequently exposing them. The other is to buy other people's translations cheaply, change the names to their own, and sell them at a higher price. We also often hear rumors about this. But this time, the author's article was stolen, and there is also an explanation. Mr. Shi Heng stood up for responsibility, but it is "not convenient to disclose" the explanation, so we only know part of the "scandal." What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>To expose a scandal, it must be exposed to the end. I long to know that explanation, but of course, it is only entirely out of curiosity, and also to add some knowledge to the literary world.</p>
<h3>At Mount Madeta</h3>
<p>— Hei Ying</p>
<p>Climbing along the rugged, winding mountain road, the car roared as if it was tired. The day was bright and clear, and when we arrived, we all felt hot, but when we stopped by the spring halfway up the mountain and jumped out of the car, the wind was much cooler.</p>
<p>(What a miracle! On the island of Sumatra on the equator, there is such a cool Mount Madeta. It is autumn all year round; I have been there twice, and I know that I should put on a light wool sweater now.)</p>
<p>Standing on the hillside, looking out over the distant ground, the houses and coconut groves make up a landscape oil painting. Looking further, the blue sea connects with the sky. I breathed a sigh of relief and quietly praised in my heart:</p>
<p>丨Beautiful southern island!</p>
<p>X　X　X　X</p>
<p>Taking Ya Zhen, I walked briskly on the smooth road; this little girl looked at the Madeta people with curious eyes, looking at the houses where the Madeta people lived. Passing a small stream, many children were swimming naked; the weather here is autumn, but they can still jump into the stream!</p>
<p>The scenery is almost the same as elsewhere, with coconut trees everywhere. However, there are deep green wildernesses and sulfur mountains that are constantly spewing gas. This is the old home of the Madeta people, and their style is different from that of the Malays.</p>
<p>On this day, not far from where we lived, the Madeta people's opera was being performed. Ya Zhen was clamoring to see it, but I hated those things. Now we walked to the outskirts, and a gust of wind carrying the melancholy smell of wildflowers blew on my face, and I leaned closely against her on the grass all afternoon as if I was drunk.</p>
<p>X　X　X　X</p>
<p>In the evening, Mount Madeta was silent.</p>
<p>I felt lonely. Ya Zhen was taken to the house by her mother to sleep, leaving me alone, sitting, sitting, the night was quiet.</p>
<p>X　X　X　X</p>
<p>Early in the morning, before the sunlight shone down, I got out of bed. Without washing my face, I stood in front of the window and looked out at a layer of hazy morning mist. The sulfur mountain was completely covered by fog, and in front of me was a gray haze...</p>
<p>The sunlight shone through the gray mist onto the bed, and I straightened my tie.</p>
<p>丨GoodMarning</p>
<p>Like a little bird, she jumped to the clothes rack, brought me a coat, and walked closer to me. I liked Ya Zhen's innocent smiling face.</p>
<p>(Should I give her a kiss? What a lovely girl!)</p>
<p>But I didn't stretch my mouth over; I went downstairs with her to eat breakfast.</p>
<p>Back home, I kept thinking about Mount Madeta; now I can't forget Mount Madeta. It is truly a miracle that on the island of Sumatra on the equator, there is such a cool Mount Madeta...</p>
<h3>Random Notes on Returning South (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Tang Tao</p>
<p>(2) Lamenting the Past</p>
<p>When I got home, I had some refreshments. My mother was the first to tell me some trivial family matters. Nothing has been right in the past few years. We lose hundreds of dollars every year on the fields. The wages of the helpers are equal to the wages of a clerk in a small shop, but they are still lazy and gluttonous, gambling until three in the morning, and then lying in bed during the day pretending to have a stomachache.</p>
<p>Since my father died, everyone in the village has become indifferent. Friends, of course, are out of the question, and even relatives have slipped away one by one. When a woman manages the household, she is bullied everywhere. Who is willing to say a fair word?</p>
<p>All of these things have added deep wrinkles to my mother's face, giving her a heavy cough in the morning and causing her to dream about prosperity, decline, and human warmth and coldness at night.</p>
<p>My mother asked me about my journey. My nephews and nieces surrounded me, asking for comic books. I just thought silently, thinking that this family had a musty smell of decay, the courtyard was so deserted, I could almost find the footprints of weasels in every corner; there was an empty swallow's nest hanging on the beam; sparrows were nesting in the seams of the tiles; and gray-white lime and eroded wood chips often fell from the ceiling and pillars. Home, this is nothing like our home of a few years ago.</p>
<p>A few years ago, our house was always full of people. Although we were always poor at heart, we children were happy enough, jumping, laughing, fighting, and only adults hated us for being too noisy and unruly. Heaven knows, now it has become like this!</p>
<p>I ran upstairs, and loneliness followed me upstairs. Opening my suitcase, I wanted to find my childhood, my unruly jumping, laughing, and fighting. Here, there were piles and piles of my elementary school copybooks, dictation books, and composition books, white paper, black characters, worm-like strokes; I saw the Roman letters written in red ink after each article, one hundred points, ninety points; I remembered the joy of receiving the booklets from the teacher's hand. I remembered the lotus root fields planted along the river, and my two sisters and I carrying our schoolbags to school there every day. I remembered the image of Guan Gong, enlarged and painted from a illustrated novel and pasted on the gate. I remember everything, but nothing allows me to recall it again. The tree trunk on my eldest sister's grave has grown taller than a person, and my second sister's children can also read comic books and draw Guan Gong to paste on the gate.</p>
<p>I, myself, have become the supporter of this deserted courtyard.</p>
<p>My mother said that I was tired from the journey and advised me to sleep for a while. Lying on the bed in my old home, I dreamed of the prosperity of the past.</p>

<h3>Dusk</h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>Measuring the endless, quiet, and long days, Qingzhi and Qingsong's ages were both over thirty.</p>
<p>Although this does not count as reaching an age that only makes people sigh; but their hearts, year after year, are sinking into a state of aging. Coupled with a dim, unadorned, yellow face: on which are dry lips, and lifeless eyes surrounded by dark circles; they have also not worn bright clothes for a long time, and have slender bodies, walking with slow steps... Like these, can make people know, after seeing them for the first time, that they are only thirty-one years old, and let out a slight sigh: "Ah, they are only thirty-one years old!"</p>
<p>They are also silent, even when there are only two of them, they don't talk much; in front of people, they are almost like reclusive monks. When they really want to say something, they just let their lips move slightly. They engrave all events in their hearts.</p>
<p>Called sisters, they are twin sisters. The older sister, Qingzhi, came into this world half a day earlier than her younger sister, Qingsong. In appearance, behavior, and personality: they have great similarities. But in terms of encounters, Qingsong became a widow just three months after getting married; while Qingzhi is still an old maid who has not married.</p>
<p>Qingsong's marriage was in the year she was nineteen: the husband was a third-stage tuberculosis patient. Originally, she would not have married so early, because of a bit of truth in the legends of this ancient nation, saying that it could be useful, she turned Qingsong from a girl into a woman, and this period was only a short three months, and she became a widow without a husband again.</p>
<p>In her husband's house, in her own house: a widow must somehow spend her long years of widowhood alone. So, after guarding her mourning for a year in her husband's house, she was picked up by her wealthy father and returned to her mother's house.</p>
<p>Ah, this year, the only things that accompanied her day and night were tears and shadows, not because she was mourning the dead, but because she thought that even a young girl could only live a lonely life until the day she died, so beautiful things were just empty, and things that could arouse the interest of young people only made her frown even tighter. Her mother and sister often came to see her, and Qingbai, who was still studying, also came to accompany her on holidays, but this caused her greater sadness, that is, without overly sentimental leaning on her mother's shoulder or hugging her sister and crying bitterly, she would shed more tears. People with bone-deep affection, it is more difficult to endure the bitterness in their hearts.</p>

<h3>Financial Foreign News: Silver and Gold Markets Waver and Fall</h3>
<p>—Another Drop of $2.60—</p>
<p>The gold market's situation was wavering yesterday. International telegrams were ominous, with little good news. After a brief stabilization, prices ultimately fell. According to foreign telegrams, London's major metals market and New York silver prices both rose. The Shanghai Metal Exchange's forward silver prices also rose by 2.3 to 3.1%. Exchange rates slightly decreased. London spot gold fell by two pence, American cotton rose by fifteen points, and American wheat rose by 1.25 to 75 points. The opening price for wool was slightly higher, rising to $55-56. After entering the market, the situation hovered. After rising to over six dollars, the supply suddenly increased, and a decline was seen. After the opening, the domestic market was loose and flooded, and prices fell immediately. After entering the market, the exchange rate quoted by British and American banks was flat. Banks took the opportunity to buy cheap, and although prices rebounded, foreign telegrams stated that the U.S. House of Representatives' Monetary Committee was scheduled to begin discussing silver issues this Saturday. It was difficult to stabilize the market immediately. Under the fluctuation, Reuters reported that although the U.S. Treasury Secretary stated that Professor Viner's trip to England was purely for travel and had no mission, it was widely rumored in England that the professor was entrusted with stabilizing the pound, causing prices to rise. However, the noon closing was still flat. After the market closed, Reuters in Paris telegraphed that the International Chamber of Commerce had designated a small group meeting to draft a powerful proposal to stabilize currencies for success, and the conference indicated the possibility of currency stabilization, causing a sudden surge after the closing. However, these telegrams lacked actual strength, causing the subsequent market opening to remain mediocre. Banks were reluctant to buy, and rumors suddenly spread in the market that the Executive Yuan had approved the Silver Association's regulations, causing a sudden fatigue in the market. Speculator Mr. Wu sold off, nearly approaching the $50 mark. The price of pure gold was calculated at $968. The Central Bank's spot price was approximately the same as the ban on gold in April, so there was a lack of transactions. The market situation for today is recorded below:</p>

<h3>Securities and Bond Markets Extremely Dull</h3>
<p>Fluctuations within a Dollar or so</p>
<p>Price-Limited Transactions Still Lively</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market price of the Chinese Securities Exchange was sluggish, no different from before. Transactions still failed to improve slightly. Most buyers in the market were new traders, and most sellers were bulls exiting the market. Both sides had price limits, matching positions, so it was relatively lively. Of particular note, buyers were enthusiastic about No. 4, and a few also bought Nos. 5, 11, and 20, etc. Sellers were mostly Nos. 41 and 54, etc. The situation remained a cyclical brewing, with minimal fluctuations. In the morning's first trading session, prices were slightly lower by one or two cents. The second trading session was the clearest, with ups and downs, fluctuating only within five cents. Only the gold short rose by 2.5 cents. In the afternoon's opening, most prices turned slightly higher by about one cent due to the larger appetite for No. 4. The closing price still tended to be uneven, fluctuating around one cent. Among them, only the current month's No. 19 Good Ending, due to the slightly greater need for No. 4, rose by three cents, the highest for the day. As such, the number of transactions gradually increased with repeated brewing. As new advances showed a slightly greater volume, the bulls took the opportunity to exit the market. As new sellers showed slightly more enthusiasm, the shorts took the opportunity to cover their positions. The interaction between the two sides caused the market price to tend towards flat. In summary, there were more declines than rises. The declines were generally one or two cents, and the rises were mostly the 22nd Customs, rising by three cents to six cents at most. No. 19 Good Ending and the near-term 20 Volume Far-Term Whole Six were slightly better, by five cents to two cents or so. The door to dullness was not easy to open. The total number of transactions was 5,706,000 dollars, including 1,000 dollars in spot and 5,705,000 dollars in futures. The high, low, rise, and fall are listed in the comparison table on the left (unit: dollars, transaction unit: 100 dollars):</p>

<h3>Increased New Buys on New York Stock Market</h3>
<p>New Feng Foreign Firm reports: On the 8th, the New York stock market was still mixed and slightly lower. However, due to Roosevelt's new attitude towards airmail and good earnings reports from various companies, morale has shown a turning point. Later, the drafter of the Frazier-Lemke Farm Bankruptcy Act declared that the bill would be amended, including the relaxation of margin requirements. Transactions suddenly became active, shorts covered, and new buyers surged in, fearing being left behind. The current prices are indeed very cheap. The U.S. Treasury Department issued only 460 million dollars in treasury bonds this time, so U.S. government bonds were unusually strong, creating a new high price for the year. The small exchange market also rose, with a total of 1.7 million shares traded for the day. Wheat longs continued to sell off, brokers absorbed, benefiting the longs. Cotton had little fluctuation in the morning, but rose with the stock market in the afternoon due to the impending lenient amendment of the bill restricting speculation on the securities exchange. According to reports, the Soviet Union will purchase 500,000 bales of American cotton, and the financial community is willing to provide assistance, so it is indeed possible to realize. Opinions on the proposal to increase New York warehouse fees are becoming increasingly inconsistent. The May period has settled. The Dow Jones indices are listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Change from Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 102.10 Up 0.51</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks 48.32 Up 0.72</p>
<p>20 Utility Stocks 26.36 Up 0.46</p>
<p>40 Bonds 92.02 Up 0.07</p>
<p>11 Commodities 3.99 Up 0.44</p>
<h3>Yarn Retail Investors Inclined to Dump</h3>
<p>The yarn market is weakening, and the situation is softening again. Because there is still no hope for a large-scale improvement in actual demand, and various businesses remain depressed, general retail investors are inclined to dump. However, foreign cotton is strong and rising. The amount absorbed by a certain manufacturer is not released. In short, the environment is bad. Although the base is depleted, it is still difficult to arouse buying interest.</p>
<h3>Marked Yarn Weakens Again</h3>
<p>In the pre-market opening for marked yarn, the market situation was still good because American cotton rose and the selling sentiment in the market was not strong. By the second and third bidding rounds, market prices tended to fall. As a result, the spot month rose by 30 cents, and the far month fell by 3, 4, and 60 cents. In the afternoon, because cotton was flat and tired, the yarn market fell again, with each month falling by 2, 5, 7, and 80 cents. The total number of transactions for the day was 13,800 bales. The statistics show that Dafu sold 350 bales, Tongfu sold 300 bales, Dafeng sold 455 bales, Tonghe sold 450 bales, Mingde sold 450 bales, and Hengchang sold 400 bales. Dachang bought 1,000 bales, Tongfu bought 550 bales, Huikang bought 900 bales, Senkang bought 300 bales, and Yuande bought 350 bales. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Month Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Rise Fall Inventory</p>
<p>March 177.4 176.5 176.5 Down 0.5 50,900</p>
<p>April 177.7 176.5 176.5 0.7 83,250</p>
<p>May 178.3 177.1 177.1 1.0 11,400</p>
<p>June 178.5 177.5 177.5 0.8 11,800</p>
<p>July 179.0 178.3 178.3 0.5 12,900</p>
<p>August 179.7 179.0 179.0 0.9 14,450</p>
<h3>Yarn Sales Increase Slightly</h3>
<p>Current yarn sales are more than before. The statistics show that various gangs bought a total of 425 bales for the day. The market is flat. The amount purchased by each gang is as follows:</p>
<p>Inland 395 Fujian 10 Shantou 50 Colleagues 10</p>
<p>Ningbo 15 Northern Gang 35 Guangdong 10</p>
<h3>Marked Cotton Still Under Pressure from Sellers</h3>
<p>The cotton market is still tired, and the situation is getting weaker. Because the cotton stored in various warehouses is thicker, and the yarn market is tired, the current cotton business is still lackluster, so the pressure from sellers is particularly heavy. However, American cotton has turned upward, and the people in this port have not been excited. Because Indian cotton is softer, and it is expected that American cotton will have a correction tomorrow, the market price is trending downward.</p>
<h3>Marked Cotton Falls Two Cents</h3>
<p>In the pre-market opening for marked cotton, the market sentiment was still good. The buying momentum in the market was not strong by the second and third bidding rounds, and the closing price fell again, with each month falling by one cent. The market sentiment was even weaker in the afternoon, with each month falling by 1.5 to 2.5 cents. The total number of transactions for the day was 48,000 dan. The statistics show that Tongfu sold 1,900 dan, Yuda sold 1,800 dan, Ruida sold 1,800 dan, Changyu sold 1,200 dan, Taichang sold 1,100 dan, and Shenji sold 2,700 dan. Dafeng bought 2,000 dan, Yuanda bought 1,300 dan, Yifeng bought 2,600 dan, Jifeng bought 1,800 dan, Dafu bought 1,400 dan, Yuanda bought 1,500 dan, Renfeng bought 1,200 dan, and Deji bought 1,000 dan. The highest price and closing price for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Month Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Rise Fall Inventory</p>
<p>March 42.40 42.10 42.10 Down 1.5 122,000</p>

<p>August 35.90 35.55 35.55 2.0 22,900</p>
<h3>No Demand from Raw Cotton Mills</h3>
<p>The need for current cotton is quite stagnant. The intentions of various mills are very dull. The source counted 350 bales of Yao flower, and there is no opening for current flowers.</p>
<h3>American and Indian Cotton Equally Rebound</h3>
<p>Yesterday's American cotton market was mixed and uncertain. It started with weakness due to the poor cloth market, but later rebounded strongly due to the powerful rise on Wall Street. As a result, spot rose by 15 points, and futures rose by 15 to 24 points. Liverpool cotton spot fell by 4 points, and futures fell by 3-4 points. Egyptian cotton spot fell by 6 points. The Bombay cotton market started with a rise due to short covering and speculative buying, but later weakened as longs took profits. As a result, Pingal rose by 2.5 rupees, and Omra and Bai Luoxi both rose by 1 rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram dated the 8th):</p>
<p>American Cotton Change from Previous Day Converted to National Currency English Cotton Change from Previous Day Converted to National Currency</p>

<h3>Tianjin Xihua Cotton Slightly Shows Signs of Life</h3>
<p>Tianjin News: After a long period of stagnation, the Xihua cotton market is now beginning to show signs of life. Although there were contacts in the morning, they did not come to fruition. In the afternoon, a foreign merchant bought 269 bales, opening at 41.3 dollars. There were no other transactions. Foreign merchants showed better interest in Donghe long-staple cotton, and good goods were also made. Dongmianxing bought 100 bales of net goods, opening at 45.5 dollars. Ruiyuanxing bought 123 bales, opening at 41.6 dollars.</p>
<h3>Grains Flour Prices Rebound Firmly in Afternoon Trading to Cover Short Positions</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the flour market, after trading opened in the morning, prices for all months generally displayed a flat and weak trend. Due to the quotation for foreign wheat being better by about one jiao in Chicago, and better by varying amounts up to four fen in Canada, market sentiment was generally weak after the opening prices. It was confirmed by both government and private sources that the government wheat was being sold in large quantities. It is rumored that Fook and Foo corporations together have a total of seventeen ships, with seven ships remaining, which were purchased separately by small local factories and factories along the Yangtze River. The price was as low as $3.80. It is said that this special accommodation was made to compensate for losses due to the previously levied wheat tax. However, the market is currently sluggish, and factories are temporarily adopting a cautious approach. Therefore, although sentiment is weak, the declines have not been very large. The July contract only reached 2.025 yuan, close to the 2 yuan mark, while the other months mainly saw declines of just a few fen. When trading opened at noon, due to the market being short, there was eager covering of positions. Large factories were uniformly firm, with only small factories selling slightly, so prices rebounded. According to the current situation, prices may temporarily stabilize, but considering the decline in various commodity prices, there is little hope for a bright future.

<h3>期麥清淡現麥步俏</h3>
<p>Quiet Trading in Wheat Futures, Spot Wheat Gradually Gains Favor</p>
<p>Yesterday in the wheat futures market, after trading opened in both the morning and afternoon, prices for all months generally showed a stable trend. The quotation for foreign wheat was better by one jiao in Chicago, and better by four fen in Canada. After the opening prices, market sentiment remained stable. Although a large batch of government wheat has been traded, it is said that the exchange market had prior negotiations and agreed not to sell, so although the trend is not very good, there are also few sellers. Trading in each contract was as quiet as before, and this is the reason. The closing result was that only July was down by one fen, with no changes in the other months. In the spot wheat market, because arrivals and inventories are not abundant, and because factories mostly use foreign wheat, domestic wheat must be blended, so prices are gradually gaining favor. Kainan Suchow wheat was at 3.53 yuan, Shandong wheat at 2.51 yuan, and Bengbu wheat at 3.44 yuan, totaling 2,500 bags, which were handled by Fooshin Huafong Company.</p>
<h3>蘇常白粳回好五分</h3>
<p>Soochow and Changchow White Rice Improves by Five Fen</p>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, more than thirty sources from various gangs (4,500-6,600 shih) arrived, and wholesale sales at the beginning of the market still seemed normal. Later, the weather suddenly turned cloudy, and buyers' sentiment tightened, causing the situation to move upward. Local shops actively purchased, about 3,000+ shih. Prices for Soochow and Changchow gangs' rice improved by five fen. As for the purchases by out-of-town buyers, only those from Beiyang, Tianjin, and Yantai showed activity, resulting in the purchase of more than 2,000 bags. Although sellers took the opportunity to push up prices for late rice, buyers were reluctant to loosen their grip, so the slightly increased prices for Qingjiao, Songjiang, Sixian, and Xilian late rice remained in a tight situation. Although Du Yang pointed rice was affected by the out-of-town pointed rice, market sentiment remained somewhat firm, allowing it to hold steady. Prices for Yinbianyuan followed the variable market conditions, with little change.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, thirteen or fourteen boats from various gangs arrived from the river region. Sales of various goods in the market showed slight improvement. High-quality white rice remained stable, while medium and lower grades increased slightly. Sheep Du pointed rice remained firm, and out-of-town buyer's pointed rice, early thin rice, and Yinbianyuan rice were firm.</p>
<h3>客秈本銷活潑</h3>
<p>Customer Indica Rice Sales Active</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for customer indica rice saw active buying by local buyers. Although merchants continued to seek to sell, the market was no longer as sluggish as the previous day. After opening flat in the morning, the market picked up as local sales were brisk. Later, orders came from Fuzhou, Shantou, Wenzhou and other gangs, and the market immediately rebounded. As a result, prices of higher quality goods rose by two or three fen, while medium and lower grades remained unchanged. A total of 4,467 bags were sold, including 100 bags of machine-milled rice to Wenzhou, 297 bags of Baijing rice to Shantou, and more than 850 bags to Fuzhou, with the remainder being purchased by local buyers. Because local demand remains strong, the market can temporarily stand firm.</p>
<h3>黄豆去路步見减縮</h3>
<p>Soybean Sales Gradually Decline</p>
<p>Yesterday, soybean sales weakened and the market trended downward. In general, the abundant supply and sluggish sales made it difficult for the market to develop. Although factories were active, soybean demand also decreased due to the poor price of soybean cake. Yesterday, one cart of Linzhun Guandou beans was sold for $2.35, and one cart of Huaiyuan beans was sold for $2.40. Retail sales in the local market totaled about four carts, including two carts of Zhengyang Guandou beans at $2.68 to $2.65, one cart of Yingzhou beans at $2.57 to $2.56, and one cart of Bozhou beans at $2.52.</p>
<h3>糖市　潮青糖市勢轉定</h3>
<p>Sugar Market: Chaoqing Sugar Market Trend Stabilizes</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's actual sales remained sluggish, and the guild's sentiment remained cautious. Prices for coarse sugar like 24 were listed at $19.70, with only dozens of bags traded. The A grade of Hainan brown sugar and Yantai gang sugar saw some movement, with a total of five or six hundred bags sold at prices of $13.30, $13.40, and $13.50. Due to abundant inventories, the market remained stable. A batch of Chaoqing sugar arrived yesterday on the Yih Ho Company's He Sheng ship, totaling 3,357 bags. Sales have been slightly slow in recent days, and the situation has stabilized.</p>
<h3>南北貨　黑胡椒地價報漲</h3>
<p>North-South Goods: Black Pepper Landed Price Reported Higher</p>
<p>Arrivals of pepper are not many, while sales in Shanghai are flat. The current price for grade one is $45.50, and for black large pepper it is $45. However, the landed price has increased, with Shanghai asking for $47, creating an inverted situation.</p>
<p>Although supplies of fennel are scarce, sales are difficult to improve, as yesterday's special report indicated. The current market price for Nanning goods is over $24.70, with wholesale sales at $25. Beihai goods are selling for only $23.50, and the market is stable.</p>
<h3>油市白桐油漢市後轉機</h3>
<p>Oil Market: White Tung Oil Sees a Turnaround After Hankow</p>
<p>The trading of white tung oil in Hankow with foreign firms has been scarce in recent days, leading to successive declines. After opening at $24.50, the price fell to $24, then to $23.70, and then to $23.30 or $23.40. It was rumored that the market price on the previous day was $23. Judging from the situation, foreign firms are not making large purchases, with each transaction involving only dozens of tons, while the supply continues uninterrupted, making the market's weakness inevitable. Unexpectedly, it was suddenly rumored the night before last that foreign firms in Hankow had raised the price to $24, according to reports from those who had received telegrams from Hankow. The matter was indeed true, and foreign firms in Hankow must have made a large purchase. Foreign firms often purchase goods repeatedly, and it is impossible for outsiders to grasp their movements. Therefore, large purchases often come suddenly, and the changes in market conditions can vary greatly. This makes foreign trade difficult to deal with, and even those experienced in this field often miss opportunities. However, foreign firms have established branches in the production areas of Sichuan and Hunan to collect and handle goods. Therefore, although Hankow is nominally the center, it is gradually losing its ability to lead the market. The rise and fall of the market are controlled by foreign firms. If prices rise to $25 or above, foreign firms will stop buying, and the market will inevitably trend downward. This is why domestic sales have lost their ability to influence the market, and this has been the case for some time. Therefore, even if foreign sales prices can rise to $25 or above, it is difficult for them to be sustained, and this has been seen frequently. If this increase can be sustained, it will probably only reach $25, which would be the limit. Foreign firms will undoubtedly use their usual tactic of stopping purchases to counter the upward trend. Although local firms in Shanghai rely on Hankow, they mainly import Zhejiang tung oil. Although the Hankow market has recently seen sudden fluctuations, Zhejiang tung oil has not followed suit. This is probably because spring sales are not yet strong, so both buying and selling are very calm.</p>
<h3>五金　英白鐵售價步鬆</h3>
<p>Hardware: British Galvanized Iron Sheet Prices Gradually Ease</p>
<p>The trading of British galvanized iron sheets has not seen much progress recently, as the market is flooded with goods from the Orient, which has greatly affected sales. The current price for 3x7 foot sheets is estimated at $1.20 each, down another five fen from before. 3x6 foot sheets are priced at $1, also down three or four fen from the previous level. Thick galvanized iron sheets are selling for $12.20 for 24 gauge, $13.10 for 26 gauge, and $13.80 for 28 gauge, all up one or two jiao from before, but there is still no major progress in future trading, so people in the industry are quite pessimistic.</p>

<h3>After Reading "An Open Letter to College Students"</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Mr. Pan Guangdan recently published "An Open Letter to College Students" in the latest issue of "Hua Nian". Mr. Pan's letter is intended for college students to read. Although I am not currently a college student, I am very happy to read it, and after reading it, I want to say a few words. This should be my right, right? The intention of Mr. Pan's open letter is undoubtedly very sincere. He sees that current college students are not only delayed by corrupt university education but are also often used by political activists, resulting in the loss of everything. Therefore, he specifically puts forward two methods to offer to them, hoping to remedy the future of college students. How should we thank him!</p>
<p>What are the two points that Mr. Pan wants to discuss publicly? (1) Instrumental knowledge. (2) A detached interest in current affairs. Regarding the first point, Mr. Pan advocates: "Whether your interest is in science or liberal arts, I believe that you should at least master Chinese and English fluently. You should not only be able to read Chinese quickly but also be able to write fluently. You should be able to understand the essence of a piece of writing in English without flipping through a dictionary." At first glance, these words seem to belittle college students too much. Why should a college student still do this kind of work? In fact, he is not wrong. Under today's Chinese university education, not to mention that advanced knowledge cannot be obtained, but even the ability to read and write Chinese and English freely is probably not the majority, right? It is heartbreaking to say this, but the fact is like this, so how can we conceal it? Therefore, I think that Mr. Pan's instructions are really a most pertinent attempt. A college student who can achieve this level, as Mr. Pan said, will not only benefit a lot in academic progress but will also find it easier to work in society.</p>
<p>As for the second point, I feel that this is truly Mr. Pan's painstaking words. He reminds a group of college students to cultivate a detached interest in the current political situation. He believes that the environment we are currently in is a world that emphasizes ideologies. A college student, if he does not have a detached interest, will sooner or later join their ranks. This will certainly increase their strength, but it will be a great loss to oneself. Therefore, he advocates, "Your personal political activities should be postponed until after graduation. Before graduating, your interest in politics should be completely detached, like your interest in other knowledge and things, and not be dominated by private interests." Mr. Cai Yuanpei tells us, "Study without forgetting to save the country, save the country without forgetting to study." Our country has now been brought to such a terrible state, and all Chinese people should do their part to contribute to the country. Moreover, students are the backbone of society, so how can we stand idly by and bury ourselves in books? Therefore, I believe that a college student engaging in the national salvation movement is worthy of encouragement. However, it is permissible to sacrifice oneself for the country voluntarily, but one should oppose being used for the activities of individuals or factions. Mr. Pan said it very clearly, "I believe that teaching a person whose thinking is immature and whose knowledge is insufficient to join a party is not only unhelpful to that individual but also hinders the organization of a party." How incisive these words are. I feel that in the current state, this point is more important than instrumental knowledge.</p>
<p>The above is a little thought I had after reading Mr. Pan's letter. Finally, Mr. Pan's conclusion is this: "Achieving the second point can settle your mind for studying, and achieving the first point can further enrich your ability to study. With both mind and ability in place, you will not fail the generous opportunities given to you by the country, society, and family."</p>

<h3>The Art of Sleeping (Part Two) Yi Lu</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>The physiologist has never opened his eyes so wide before. He stares blankly at the ceiling, slowly reaches into his pocket, and pulls out a box of "Maistre" cigarettes. The lid is open, but there's only a half-smoked cigarette butt left inside. I know there's nothing for me, so I continue:</p>
<p>"In the morning, the clock strikes ten. The bed shakes again. The man wakes up, sticks his head out, and looks at the clock, 'Oh! Ten o'clock!' The woman also seems to wake up and says quickly, 'What's the rush? Come on, sleep for another moment.' 'There are things to do at the company.' 'Oh my! Are you the general manager?' The woman's hand reaches over, and finally, the man's head also falls back down... Friends, think about it, if this isn't art, what is it?"</p>
<p>The physiologist is a bit excited. He's still holding the half-inch-long cigarette butt in his hand. But he's very clever; he understands that this is bourgeois. Suddenly, he throws the cigarette butt away, looking very indignant but also very disappointed. Finally, he blurts out this reluctant remark: "This is art? Art is for everyone."</p>
<p>"Everyone? Well, this is just one example I'm giving. Are commoners like us worthy of experiencing this magnificent art? Don't even think about it, don't even think about it, don't even think about it. However, we have our own comforts in sleeping. Since we can't get jobs as clerks or bookkeepers, and we don't have the fate to be anything like bank tellers or bureau members, our sleeping has to be free and unrestrained. We can sleep as late as we want and get up as late as we want. Although the room we sleep in is simple—the walls are plastered with newspapers, the table has only three legs left, with a stick replacing the broken one, two or three broken benches, the bed is two long benches with a door placed on top, covered with three or four inches of straw, a quilt with seven holes and eight tears, and a black, damp, tattered cotton blanket—when it comes time for us to sleep, we can still tuck our legs into the cotton blanket and lean our upper bodies against the wall; we can still read last night's big evening newspaper while lying down. If it happens to be a rainy day, then there's even more natural and melodious music for us to listen to and enjoy. The "chala-la" sound of water leaking from the broken drainpipe to the ground, the "dada" sound of rain hitting the newspaper-covered window, plus the "puff-puff" sound of the paper getting damp and being blown by the wind—these are all enough for us to enjoy. If you want to hear a little tune, you might as well ask your little bound-footed wife to sing a song... 'In the first month...sleeping... celebrating the Lantern Festival... I see... my sister is born pretty...' And if there's no rice to cook tomorrow, then get angry and cover your head to sleep through the day. 'Rejoicing even in a dry rut,' 'Isn't that a gentleman?' Isn't this an art of 'nothingness'? Why isn't it for everyone?"</p>
<p>The physiologist is somewhat excited again, as if because I brought up his wife. A slight smile appears on his face, but in an instant, it disappears again. Then, he sighs without saying a word. After all, he has been seduced by materialism and must be thinking: Shame, shame!</p>
<p>"However, things in the world can't be absolute; there always has to be an exception. Just as sleeping can be called art, it's the same. The sleeping of the portly and prosperous is certainly art; the sleeping of friends who are poor and have no way out is even more art. But those people who hold their rice bowls and tremble, serving someone else's meal, can't appreciate the comfort of sleeping; their sleeping can't be considered art. Friends, you have to understand: the comfort of sleeping is appreciated when you're already sleepy but haven't fallen asleep yet, and when you're already awake but haven't gotten up yet. When they sleep, they collapse as soon as they lie down, and they fall asleep as soon as they collapse; when dawn comes, they wake up and get up immediately. What art is there to speak of? If they also start talking about art, their rice bowls will definitely be irreconcilable with them, leading to a business shutdown. So we are still happy. Although no one pities us, no one interferes with us or controls us. How unhappy would that make us? We can also appreciate the comfort of sleeping to our heart's content!"</p>
<p>The physiologist's face is expressionless. At this time, I am truly stirred up with a belly full of worries and feel somewhat "sentimental". I pace back and forth along the edge of the bed a few times, and suddenly, I see a glimmer of light. This light gets bigger and bigger, brighter and brighter, and finally illuminates me, causing me to shout out involuntarily: "Why not walk on the great path of life but insist on crawling through this dog hole? Isn't that foolish? Tomorrow, I'll pick out a bundle of old books from under the bed and send them to the used bookstore in Chenghuang Temple to exchange for a dollar. Then I'll go to the entrance of Xinbeimen to buy an aviation lottery ticket, and if I win 50,000 yuan, wouldn't I instantly become a Buddha?" Unexpectedly, the physiologist rises and responds, saying: "Excellent words! This old man should rise and imitate them!" (End)</p>

<h3>Spring, Is It Worth Praising?</h3>
<p>— Xiao Zhi</p>
<p>丨Reminiscing About the Departed Winter丨</p>
<p>Spring, always praised and admired by people, has indeed returned to the world. Nature has taken on a completely new and vibrant atmosphere. Many people, those who naturally praise it, have also genuinely changed to a warm and smiling countenance, their mouths constantly shouting, "Welcome spring and receive blessings!"</p>
<p>However, spring, I detest it the most, resent it, curse it. Of all the seasons, spring leaves the worst impression on me! Because it has never brought me any "blessings." What it brings me is only annoying, depressing, cursed warmth! This warmth has made me suffer from many illnesses, and it even triggers my old ailments. My active and forward-moving spirit is all tricked away by its bewitchment, and I become a soft, sentimental, and decadent person!</p>
<p>How cursed this season should be! Its warmth has deceived me, and it has deceived many others who share my fate. It has numbed me, and it has numbed many others who share my fate! Yet, people, pitiful insects of people, still foolishly wait for its "blessings," waiting for joy to descend. Isn't this too contrary to reason?</p>
<p>Perhaps when spring arrives in the world, it causes the withered old trees to sprout tender buds, and the withered yellow grass to grow green shoots, giving the world another painting of red and green colors, and all things undergo a revival. However, the spring feelings that spring brings to people are forever melancholic, lazy, depressed, and haggard, stealing away people's vitality and vigor like a hypnotist. When people arrive, when people arrive in spring, they lose the power of life. This is the exact opposite of how grass and trees gain the opportunity for revival in spring.</p>
<p>In this way, the world of things and the world of people are forever irreconcilable. Spring, envied by so many, only ever gives people melancholy, numbness, and a lazy inability to live. This signifies the decline of people and the prosperity of things. Many heartbroken poets of the past searched for spring feelings in the world of things, but never have they seen a single infatuated poet utter a sound of joy in the world of people. Poets in the world of people can never find spring feelings; what they find are some "emptiness, like a dream," such desolate sighs.</p>
<p>The meaning of spring is to give people melancholy, numbness, pointless sentimentality, and decadence. This makes me infinitely nostalgic for the recently departed winter and pay it the greatest respect! Because winter, the severe and great winter, although it exerts its supreme power over people, causing many to succumb and even sacrifice themselves under its stern might, it is precisely because of this immense and supreme pressure that it keenly stimulates people's nerves, giving people a powerful warning: "Defend! Defend against this cruel and harsh winter!" Think about it, when a person is hungry, unless they are a fool or a weakling, will they just wait to starve to death? Similarly, when it's cold, they will naturally develop a great courage and vitality to survive! Look again, in this season, the roaring of the wind, the clamor of the trees, the hard and brittle ice, the piercingly cold snow, the bone-chilling cold, stiffness, bleeding... Isn't this enough tension and vigilance? Struggle, uplift, inspire, and strive become the active, forward-moving, and inevitable force of reaction in this season!</p>
<p>Winter tightly compels people to grasp the power of life, risking the full fire of life, to be active in a human world purified by pure snow. How majestic, how great! Whoever has power, whoever has life. How vivid, how brave, and how full of righteous spirit!</p>
<p>Spring, although it also has its flames, these flames can only burn people's lives, cause sorrow, ignite the courage to tend towards a decadent body, and lull people into a dream... Spring, creating so many "human sins," is spring still worth our praise?</p>
<p>We cannot forget the stimulation that winter gives us, the great vitality of life. Vigilant people, holding the solemnity of winter, bravely engage in battle with the spirit of open warfare! However, under the anesthesia of spring, we still need to muster the spirit of battle!</p>
<p>Amateur Mailbox</p>
<h3>I Don't Want Her Anymore</h3>
<p>Editor Sir,</p>
<p>I am twenty years old now. When I was seventeen, by the order of my parents and the words of a matchmaker, I got engaged to a woman from the village in front of our village. According to our local customs, women mostly go outside to work in factories. So this woman also worked in a nearby factory. Last year, the factory closed down due to losses, and the other party faced financial difficulties. The whole family moved to Shanghai to make a living. After arriving in Shanghai, a place where all evils are committed, this woman soon became romantically involved with someone else. This is news that was spread by others, with no definite evidence; later, my family suddenly received a letter from Shanghai with no sender, the content of which said, "This woman is not keeping to proper feminine behavior outside, recklessly flirting and messing around with people. I am calling your mother to come to Shanghai to take her back" and other such things. My mother ignored it and let her go. Of course, when I received this news, I wanted to dissolve the engagement and not have her anymore. However, I don't have a proper way to do it. Now, I have written down several questions below. Please teach me, sir:</p>
<p>(1) If I publish a declaration in the newspaper to dissolve the engagement, will it be legally effective?</p>
<p>(2) Can the anonymous letter be used as evidence? Will it be legally effective?</p>
<p>(3) Can the betrothal gifts from before be recovered?</p>
<p>With best regards,</p>
<p>Respectfully, Zhang Mengjiong</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Mr. Zhang's inquiries are answered separately as follows:</p>
<p>(1) An engagement must be dissolved by suing the court; it cannot be resolved with a "declaration in the newspaper."</p>
<p>(2) An anonymous letter cannot be used as evidence.</p>
<p>(3) If an engagement is invalid, the party at fault should be responsible for restoring the innocent party to their original state. Therefore, if the fault lies with the other party, Mr. Zhang can, of course, demand the return of the betrothal gifts from her.</p>
<p>In short, Mr. Zhang still cannot be sure if his fiancée is committing adultery with someone else, so it seems there is no legal basis for dissolving the engagement. However, since this engagement was not made by Mr. Zhang himself, there is no harm in denying it, but this should be considered and decided by Mr. Zhang himself. The editor cannot strongly advise Mr. Zhang to proceed with dissolving the engagement.</p>
<p>Substitute Mail: Xu Zhengshou, please note: I am sorry that I could not reply immediately about the matter you entrusted me with because I was busy.</p>

<p>Fiction</p>
<h3>Lulu's Victory (7)</h3>
<p>— Written by Italian M. Serrao, Translated by Jingxin</p>
<p>"Robert sat in the car and passed by here, he was wearing a gray coat."</p>
<p>"Good heavens! How do you know all this? I thought you were reading!"</p>
<p>"I was just sitting by the window."</p>
<p>"You recognized him even when you didn't look at Robert? Strange! Did he bow to you?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"How did he take off his hat?"</p>
<p>"Oh! Just like he usually does."</p>
<p>"Did you return the greeting?"</p>
<p>"Do you think I understand etiquette?"</p>
<p>"At least you smiled at him, right?"</p>
<p>"No! That's... I don't know."</p>
<p>"You are bland, Sophia. Robert told me about you last night."</p>
<p>"He told you I was bland?"</p>
<p>"No, but he asked me why your personality is so cold and so different from mine. So I recited a long eulogy to him; I told him you are better, gentler, and more lovely than me, your only shortcoming is that you hide all these good qualities. Think about it, you listened to my speech with great interest; finally, he asked me why I hate him—"</p>
<p>"Hate him?"</p>
<p>"That's what he said, you have to know, his words are not completely wrong; you treat him too unkindly. But even on this point, I defended you; I told a little lie, I told him that you really like him very much, and that you praise him extremely highly—"</p>
<p>"Lulu!"</p>
<p>"I know this isn't true, but Robert likes you very much, and isn't it too heartless of you to treat him like a stranger?"</p>
<p>Sophia opened her arms and hugged her sister's neck, kissing her; Lulu endured it for a while, and said softly in a lovely voice:</p>
<p>"Why don't you like Robert a little?"</p>
<p>The sister suddenly stopped for a moment, did not say a word, and backed away.</p>
