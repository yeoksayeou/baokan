<p>— （求）</p>
<p>昨哈瓦斯倫敦電。謂德國內部。似已潛伏不安狀態。在此歐洲局勢非常緊張之時。驟聆此訊。似乎覺得突兀。然證以本月十九路透所述。德國當道已命令國社黨及同類組織非經核准均不得集會之説。則德國政局或有一種變化之醖釀。亦未可知也。</p>
<p>依吾人表面之觀察。希特拉氏自統治德國以來。爲時不久。而地位聲望似有與日俱隆之勢。中經本年六月三十日之政變。雖其手創之衝鋒隊。不免多遭殺戮。而該隊之目前勢力。尚有二百八十萬人。連同現有之常備軍·國防軍·警備隊等。統計德國軍力不下五百五十萬之衆。此外尚有曾受訓練之空軍駕馭員四千人。此雖爲德人之敵方所宣傳。然以彼經年整軍備武之積極。此數與事實相去當亦不遠。是以其歐洲之隣邦。一聞德國有所舉動。莫不表示驚愕。以爲希氏之行動。實足以影響歐局之和平也。顧就最近事實以觀。則希氏每逢謡諑繁興之時。輒抱鎭静態度。除以渴望和平爲宣傳外。絶不稍露聲色。其故果安在歟。</p>
<p>吾人常覺希氏之應付目前歐洲大局。以法意爲主要之對象。如維也納『七二五』事變發生之時。意國躍然而起。彼乃立即轉變方針。首則調回駐奥大使。再則撤換對奥活動首領。月前薩爾問題復趨緊張。法國揚言將進兵佔據。希氏又竟諭令柏克爾發一文告。聲明自明年一月十日後停止國社黨活動一月。迄乎最近。法既聲言德爲威脅歐洲和平之基本原素。意亦鼓動奥國參加軍備平等之要求。甚且進一歩締結意奥軍事恊定。以控制多腦河之咽喉。而希氏亦皆視若無覩。始終未爲正面之抗衡。推敲其故。殆希氏猶以爲其所操政權之基礎。尚未臻於鞏固乎。</p>
<p>古今雄才大略之人。將有事於外者。必先自審其力量。力量果足。而後能進退自如。今日德國實處內外多難之秋。即以經濟言。既不能恢復昔年英美國際資本奥援之局面。復遭法意進一歩之競爭。而國內人民之所仰望於希氏者。固皆彼昔日所許予之諾言也。奈因外來國際阻力之張大。轉而牽動其內部經濟界之安定。目前外電所傳。德國政潮有不能不爆發之現象。必非嚮壁虚搆之談。吾人追求德國政局不安之根本原因。雖不能謂完全在於外交局面之僵化。然希氏將欲克服其內在的危機。自惟有轉移國人視綫。一致對外之一法。此則求之歷史先例。不勝枚舉。所可慮者。目前法國中樞。既以社會急進黨爲其政權之重心。而法人對德又頗有强硬之表示。意國在墨索里尼統治之下。政權之基礎。亦異常鞏固。無懈可擊。至於奥之內爭。尤非希氏所得而利用。可見國際方面。皆無希氏可乘之機。希氏至此自知欲轉移國人之視綫。必俟機會。不可輕動。且必自整頓內部始。此即希氏之過人處歟。</p>

<h3>中歐形勢的推移</h3>
<p>— （德國通信）</p>
<p>德波諒解之前瞻</p>
<p>法意分離之趨向</p>
<p>歐洲有兩種不同潮流的大抗爭、就原理上講、是國民主義的民族團結、與鮑爾色維克主義的世界革命的抗爭、就純國際關係講、是德意志民族和斯拉夫民族的抗爭、德意志自希特勒登台以來、中間雖經過了若干挫折受過多少國際間的指責、與國內人民的非難、然而他的命運偏好、望重一時的興登堡元帥逝世之後、他遂很順利的總攬國政、作了德國的元首、同時德國的外交困難、也稍微减輕了一些、一般經濟也勉强可以維持、所謂「德意志精神」也就唱得更響了、德意志精神又可呌他作普魯士魂、用最近形勢來解釋、是立脚於民族主義和經濟同盟之上、以求中歐經濟統一的發展、這句話歷史的由來是很久了、并不是最近纔發生的新學説、不過希勒特登台以後、德國經濟、却是得到一條出路、</p>
<p>德國有熟練的産業工人、有優秀的工廠組織、有細密的政治訓練、在世界各國中、以上諸端、他都該首屈一指、可惜他的食糧不足、其餘各種原料、都不能充分供應他工業上的發展、所以必須東聯波蘭、南結意大利、找到農業上資源的根據、找到地中海方面的海上通路、那末北鎖於英、西扼於法的情勢、就有出路、不但可以存活、而且還足以應戰了、</p>
<p>德·意·波·三國之間、有兩個不易解决的難題、（一）是波蘭走廊、隔開德國成爲兩塊、因此德波間的隔閡越深、德人的仇視波蘭也難解除、同時這也是整個歐洲的問題、（二）奥大利與德國合併問題、這事情已經鬧了很久了、奥國自身當然以與德國合併爲最有利、因爲他在經濟上、政治上、都失去了獨立性、靠外債支持、依附大國、終久不是辦法、假使德奥合併、首先受影響的是意大利、因此引起德意兩國的不恊和、直到如今、意大利對此戒備還是很嚴重、恐怕奥國脱離意國掌握、而與德意志相合併、</p>
<p>設使這兩個問題能得到適當的解决、則德·意·波·的立國精神既相近似、更講到物質的資源、波蘭有很豐富的煤鐵、意大利正缺乏這類東西、德國運用其工業技術、去供給他們、再加上羅馬尼亞等農業國家、則中歐的經濟聯盟不一定是不可能的、也就是墨索里尼·希特勒·畢蘇斯基·芜日夜想望的、并且波蘭向烏克蘭伸手、德國自然也很想乘機進窺蘇聯、帮助波蘭去求東方的土地、以新得來的土地換回隔開東普魯士與德國本部的走廊、所以本年初、德波之間先成立了十年間的互不侵犯條約、這是德國外交上的轉換、也是波蘭外交的新動向、換言之、即所謂中歐經濟聯盟的先聲、</p>
<p>假如這種想法終成爲幻夢的話、則向波羅地海求出路也是一法、於是立陶宛·愛斯多尼亞·拉多維亞頓形重要而且緊張起來、因爲他們如一刻不能向蘇聯進襲、得不到烏克蘭、就會轉其鋒芒於三小國、在地理和歷史關係上講、畢蘇斯基元帥是維爾納出身、竟可以説是立陶宛人、有這一點理由、即能乘機發起一個運動、何况三個小國都毫無足以自衛的實力、稍加壓廹、即能如願以償、合德波兩國之力、解决他們是不成問題的、然而這裏面還有凡爾賽條約關係、就是法國牽聯在內、現在的情勢、蘇聯是很要緊的一員、他决不肯袖手旁觀、任隨事情的自然變化、可是芬蘭及蘇聯是異常努力、如德波將波羅地海完全掌握在手裏、與芬蘭就能聯結起來了、其催促中歐經濟聯盟的力量就更大了、但是法蘇諒解的深密化、是無形中足以阻滯這事件進行的、可是前途依然很混沌、而抗爭却越猛烈了、（一九三四年十月十二日於柏林）</p>

<h3>泥城橋左近基地九分餘纒訟凡三十年之久</h3>
<p>雙方當事人物化後家屬又興訟端</p>
<p>上訴最高法院發回更審案始確定</p>
<p>上海地産掌故史之一頁</p>
<p>淸末民初時、有滬人鄭華華與金小雲者、因爭執泥城橋左近基地九分九厘六毫、涉訟於前會審公廨、雖經該廨一再審訊判决、然終無以折服雙方之心、徒以當時租界內無上訴機關、致該廨消滅後、此案猶未確定、故民國十六年、租界産生上訴院、不服之一造（即鄭華華）即提起上訴、請求平反、旋由該院調卷不審核之下、以鄭於公廨宣判時、並未聲明保留上訴、今遽上訴、核於所訂恊定條文不符、遂予駁斥、迨上訴院改組爲江蘇高等法院第二分院時、鄭華華·金小雲·均已相繼物化、乃有鄭華華之妻六十七歳之鄭吳氏、又向高二分院對金小雲之後裔金鳳崗提起再審之訴、謂當前公廨判决後、其夫曾投滬海道尹公署具狀上控、有狀稿可憑、應堪認爲保留上訴之左證、於恊定並不相背云云、金鳳崗則延陳霆鋭律師抗辯、以鄭吳氏並非訴訟主體、且係受人利用、更違背法例、請求仍予駁斥、前年秋、經高二分院傳集兩造研訊、結果判决鄭吳氏敗訴、該氏依然不服、復上訴於最高法院、聲請廢棄原判、仍照民國二年十一月十七日前會審公廨判决執行、着金償還地價地租、或命交還原地、近由最高法院審查終結、認以前判决、猶未盡善、爰發回高二分院更審、業經李民庭長會同韓·倪·兩推事於日前開庭、金鳳崗仍延陳霆鋭律師代表、根據以往主張、並引徵歷次判决及大理院判例、要求維持原判、駁斥該氏之聲請、現已由李庭長於昨宣判主文、謂上訴駁回、第二審及前第二審訴訟費用、由上訴人負擔、而判詞內所叙理由、尤爲綦詳、大致謂本院查前會審公廨移交本件訴訟卷宗、原無送達證書可稽、該公廨十年八月四日判决、究於何日送達於上訴人、固無從確切查明、但按該公廨所適用之會審公廨訴訟律判决與堂諭、經宣讀後、即生效力、並無必須送達之規定、勝訴之債權人並得請求公廨强制執行、况查上訴人之故夫鄭華華、於民十·八月十一日即原判决宣讀後七日內具狀、請求復審、對於原判决應行修改之點、論列綦詳、是早已領到判决、亦屬顯見、上訴人既未聲明保留上訴權、則民十·八月四日之判决、自應認爲確定、勿容藉端推翻云云、按是案纒訟至今、將達三十年之久、實爲第一特區法院內歷時最長之案、此番判决後、或不致再繼續搆訟矣、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （陳藴素）</p>
<p>或説中國人天天鬧窮的原因，完全是死在知識份子的拚命地抱着一件長衫，不肯輕易甩掉，以致弄得文不像秀才，武不像兵。</p>
<p>中國人向來對於那老字，特别感到一種興趣，所以遍地養成「少年身子老人頭」了，老大的中國，一天天地向墳墓裏送。</p>
<h3>關公蟹</h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>蟹中最著名的，就湖蟹論，自然要推那江蘇的洋澄湖蟹了。黄爪金毛鐵銹螯，背上還有一個「公」字深深地似刻在那兒，這是洋澄湖蟹的特徵。此外湖蟹，恐都望壟莫及了。至於海蟹，則種類之多，真不可以數計。</p>
<p>海濱的沙灘裏，每逢潮汛退後，常見有貧兒們手中提着筐簍，兩脚陷在泥淖裏，三三兩兩地在那兒捉海蟹。那些蟹兒，也不時從泥汚裏横爬出來，似乎是錮閉已久，要想一見天日的樣子。可是它們也頗機警，一聞聲息，就「霎」的一聲，又遁入泥淖裏去，害得那貧兒們撲了一個空。</p>
<p>説起海蟹，大小頗不一，形狀亦各異，因此名稱亦很多、大多依形定名。譬如有種小海蟹，它的頭部是方方的，於是大家即呌它做「棺材頭」，真是觸耳得很！其中最雅馴的，要推關公蟹。</p>
<p>關公蟹與通常所見的湖蟹，大略相似，只不過較小罷了。爪略長，體略扁，背形帶橢圓，它也可佐食，惟不甚肥，且亦無大鮮味。煮熟之後，其背通紅，眉目宛然，兩條臥蠶眉，向上微掀，一雙鳳眼，炯炯有神，顴骨微凸，嘴鼻的地位亦極相稱；只少幾綹美髯。細觀蟹背全部，可説與世俗所傳之關壯繆像無二。造物的化工，真不可思議！</p>
<p>如果把蟹壳作爲頭部，下粘以粘土，揑成半身，置之案頭，則儼然成一關公小象。這玩意兒，我曾玩過的，似乎比把那蟹螯黏在壁上做隻蝴蝶，有趣得多，所以我覺得這種海蟹呌做「關公」，真是最確切也没有了。</p>
<h3>曲襟馬甲</h3>
<p>— 徐豪吾</p>
<p>友朋謔浪調笑的當兒，曲襟馬甲，像英文詞藻裏面皇冠代替皇上樣，部分代表了全體；那個喜歡穿曲襟馬甲的人，漸漸被「曲襟馬甲」四字，掩没了他的真姓真名。</p>
<p>「曲襟馬甲」貌不揚，跛一足，識字無多，平常書信往來，統統要旁人代筆。</p>
<p>可是天生萬物，絀於此者未必不長於彼。「曲襟馬甲」性詼諧，擅口才，善觀風雲氣色。當周遭空氣緊張的時候，祗要微風起處，遠遠傳來了「曲襟馬甲」的「巧囀鶯簧」，如跟蹤而至的尖鋭的，悠長的，敲金擊玉的笑聲，嚴肅的氛圍，立刻會和緩下來。</p>
<p>挾了這樣一張嘴吧，一條聲帶，再加一雙鋭利的眼睛，一個老奸巨滑的頭腦，「曲襟馬甲」失業了十多年，依舊「茶來伸手，飯來張口。」天天酒肉糊塗。</p>
<p>某次，「曲襟馬甲」偷偷摸摸，將自己老婆從前一點私蓄，在立據限日獨力籌還的條件下，交給友人好好先生，呌他出面圖謀。</p>
<p>算定了渺茫的「未來」，「曲襟馬甲」回頭也不忘記把握住富有意義的「現在」。他應酬，他敷衍；他以陪客爲名，自己不名一錢，成天開房間，吃大菜，恣意口腹，縱情笑樂，着實享用了好幾時。</p>
<p>機絏是一頭勢利的狗。要是「曲襟馬甲」自命淸高，不操縱，不籠絡；不奸詐，不毒辣。那末他家裏有的是西北風，儘等着他回去喝呢！</p>
<p>— 士英</p>
<p>法國姑娘説，哼！你要去打我嗎，我的哥哥在這兒。</p>
<h3>「殺半價」</h3>
<p>— 賓錫</p>
<p>有這麽一句傳説「蘇州人，殺半價」！在買賣交易方面，蘇州人是慣會殺價的，其原由也因爲賣者「討虚頭」，所以買者便很命的「殺半價」！</p>
<p>在蘇州地方有不少小販，俗名「挑擔頭」的，挑着什麽蓮子哩，塘藕哩，山藥哩，百合哩諸如此類的東西，沿途呌賣，這些挑擔頭的，因爲，塘藕，山藥之類，並無一定的價格，于是把它特别的提高，在買的方面呢，以爲並非日常所需，所以故意殺價，在這討價與還價之間，還得雙方面的遷就，才能成交，並非説，二百文一斤的鮮藕，蘇州人老是以一百文一斤的代價成交的。我所知道的「殺半價」，大概就是關于這方面！</p>
<p>至於商店舖號，都没有什麽上落的價格更無所謂討價還價。據我所知道，有很多的商舖，還是劃一不二價。</p>
<p>不信，請到采芝齋去買瓜子，要是依照「殺半價」定例，一塊錢四罐的瓜子，那麽半塊錢就可以買四罐，要是你真的如此「殺半價」，店員在暗地裏至少送給你一個「曲死」的雅號！就是他當面不敢得罪你的話！</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第五回　諂笑逢迎挑燈照憔悴飢腸驅廹敷粉學風流</p>
<p>他臉上似乎有些紅暈了，只看他把眼皮子都低下來了，可以想到對於年齡這個問題，真有難言之隱。可是這時太陽沉落到地平綫以下去，屋子裏有些黑沉沉的，大家的面目，都看不淸楚，這位楊家五小姐，也就借了這剛來的黑暗，遮蓋了他的羞澀。在他一難爲情之中，約莫有兩三分鏱的猶豫，李士廉所問他是十八歳嗎，那一句話，早已過去多久，他也只微微的哼了一聲，就算答應了那個是字。屋子裏一切都沉寂了，大家抽烟捲的抽烟捲，喝茶的喝茶，没有人提到五小姐。李士廉道：茶房，屋子裏什麽都看不見了，還不給我們送燈來嗎？茶房早已預備好了燈火了，只是看不出這女人是怎麽回事，站在房門外邊，都聽到了。心裏想着，這樣一個女人，會是小姐，將來火車要通到了西安，比這新鮮的玩意兒，恐怕還要更多呢。這時聽到裏面有人呌着，就捧了高脚料器煤油燈進來。當然，燈是放在桌上的，楊浣花，就是靠了桌子的側面來坐下的。那煤油燈，蠶豆大的火燄，斜映了他半邊臉子，這越把那瘦削而不大黏粉的皮膚，更顯着有那隱隱的鷄皮皺的細紋。笑起來的時候，兩排牙齒，都露了出來。這分兒蒼老，那更是不用提。賈多才心裏想着，這樣的女人，在上海，便是打入野鷄隊裏，也會被淘汰掉，何以老李這樣看得起他，特意介紹着來會見。心裏想着，自然也不住的將眼光射到他身上去打量。（七三）</p>
<h3>御香縹渺錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>這樣算起來；宫裏面該有多少鬼啊？以數目來講，北京宫裏當然更比盛京的宫裏多，但北京的皇宫是終年有人住着的，並且人數很充足，因此鬼就不敢出現了；或者也可以説那些鬼因爲終年給人驚擾得慣了，所以人鬼同處，一些没有不安的現象。而這裏却已幾千年没有人住了！——雖然有留守的人，但是太少了。——這些鬼久已住得很安全，一朝忽然來了這麽許多人，那得不擾得他們不怨恨呢？我們自己儘把這裏看做我們的老家，但在他們的心目中，我們必須是一羣可惡的外族；所以他們是一定會勃然大怒，紛紛擁出來予我們以相當的威脅的。」</p>
<p>其實這些都是神經過敏的影響，那裏會真有什麽鬼，但我竟無力排除他們，只能任憑他們作祟，漸漸地把我整個的心靈一起包圍了起來；甚至當那些太監在外面庭院裏走動的時候，黯淡的燈光，映出了他們的身影來，我也會當他們是鬼的影子，立刻加上幾分恐怖的感覺。這些情形，説來都是非常可笑的，但在那個時候，身歷其境，却真有些明知是不值得恐懼而偏要恐懼的困難。其所以如此的原因，雖然很複雜，可是子細分析起來，多分還是因爲這些宫院中的景物太特别，太驀生的緣故。無論在表面上它們已給那些先期打發來的太監收拾得如何潔净，佈置得如何和北京的宫院相像，然而人力是有限的，物質可以改造，精神却不能改造。（一八三）</p>
<h3>新發明</h3>
<p>— （冰玉）</p>
<p>雞蛋的妙藥</p>
<p>雞蛋原爲人生滋養的食品，亦可爲化料的原料，但做藥材用，到現在社會上還不知道，最近學者把雞蛋中的卵黄分析開來，是含有脂肪二一·三○至二二·八四％，這脂肪中，含有阿倫，巴爾米丁，斯台林等質。假使要在卵黄中取出脂肪，可把卵黄放在鐵鍋中，加熱攪拌，那卵黄就焦黑炭化加以壓榨，流出脂肪，把脂肪乘在瓶中，雖則經久，也不會腐敗，可以常備在家庭中做藥。這脂肪油的特效，對症的疾病如下（一）治肺炎，如把烤出的油，裝在膠囊中，每次飯後，吞服一粒，能消滅肺炎毒素的毒，且能强心潤肺，（二）心臟病，如患單純的心臟病，仍照上法每日服三粒，甚效，如初患狹心病的人服了一二日，即可治愈，又患心臟脚氣病的人，連服一星期，也可以斷根，（三）結核性痔瘻，以及其他各種內外痔瘡，效騐尤靈，（四）身體衰弱，視力不凖確的人，服之能恢復視力，增加精力，（五）火傷，與各種外傷，用這脂肪油塗擦，其効如神，（六）精神疲勞，久服這油，可延年益壽，這是最近日本養雞界素負盛名的松川潔氏實際試騐的。</p>
<p>洋葱的妙藥</p>
<p>俄國最近在北滿附附近，利用腐爛的洋葱頭，製造毒瓦斯，如吸到這瓦斯氣，就要流淚噴嚏，于是引起全世界軍械學者的大衝動。然而洋葱當哥倫布時代，曾經有人把葱頭做火藥的，自俄國發明後，各國學者，爭先研究，現在確實證明不謬了。試觀我們平時用刀切洋葱時，因爲葱中含有揮發性的油假使這油冲到眼裏，就要落淚，就是眼中的血膜細胞，受了油的刺激的緣故，今若仔細分析這油的性質，的確含有毒瓦斯，就是油中混有一種「西盎」青酸，青酸有很猛烈的毒性，我們含青梅中毒，也是受青酸的作用而起的，照相上，所用的青酸加里，亦爲毒藥，外國人以青酸比害人的美女，含在洋葱中的「西盎」化合物，係硫西盎化水素，硫西盎化亞里克，所以證明洋葱中的西盎化合物，照化學方法分解起來，確含有可做毒瓦斯質素，因此我們廚房裏，如已腐敗的洋葱，那就不可以食了。</p>
<p>不醉的啤酒</p>
<p>最近德國發明了一種「不醉的啤酒」，雖飲了千杯，也不會醉，這是因爲德國人的習性，酷嗜酒，常常因爲酒醉，惹出種種是非。柏林化學家姚漢馬愛爾氏與釀酒家，經過種種苦心研究，把釀酒的原料，加以特殊的方法，以防止原料醱酵，這啤酒所含的阿爾哥爾（酒精）祇有○·三五％，而且這阿爾哥爾的性質與普通有刺激性的不同，所以雖飲了千杯，也不會醉的。</p>
<p>防旱的新藥</p>
<p>英國國民對於重工業與農業方面的改良，比歐洲各國爲進歩，其實用有益的發明，陸續發見於工塲商店街坊，對於近代生活，益形改善，最近發明界中極堪注目者，爲戈泰爾特Contald該公司，用最新式Process—經過法—製成優秀强靭的人造綢緞，而且成本甚低，所以大博社會一般的贊嘆。其次爲防止旱魃的新藥，就是物利浦爾化學研究所中的學者，發明在深海的海底，有一種特殊的沈澱物，可以代雨，以防止旱荒的新藥，其中以霍狄松氏由海浪起動力的機械裝置，已爲英國工業界所使用，今英國四面環海，如用這特殊的海底沈澱物，裝置在機械上，發數空中，就可使天空陰霾四合，變成大雨，這種新發明，對於世界上造福不淺，至於如何裝置，與如何使海底沈澱物，起了化學作用，變成大雨，現在尚未有正式詳細發表，大約不久當可公開的。</p>

<p>英軍實力真相大白</p>
<p>英尼斯球藝與實力之究竟如何、昨日一戰、大白於天下、以全隊而言、爲一中上之球隊耳、攻不如守、守勝於攻、惹人注意、守門史梅頓一人而已、其救門之技術、出神入化、確乎高人一等、周賢言之後、此君是也、昨而設無此人、英尼斯早作片片碎、不待最後之一擊也、兩後衛亦能滿意、中綫與前鋒、實不敢過分恭維、秃頂中堅湯姆遜、居中猶可、後調中鋒、一事無成、兩輔或未審東華情形、亦無從施其馬克、前鋒各個技術、水平綫上、然兩翼軟弱不堪、在合作與聯絡工夫、尤未曾見、在攻門射擊、無一人有硬碰硬之脚頭、是亦東華能保持其處女童貞、未曾被破也、雖然、外人球隊進歩之速、常在出人意料之外、英尼斯不能即以平庸之球隊視之、而有所小覷也、</p>
<p>東華表演未達頂點</p>
<p>東華昨日之表演、大體而言、尚能滿意、但亦未達其最高之頂點、中綫與後衛俱佳、陸鍾恩救出十二碼、當亦功臣、前鋒中兩翼之减色、實爲美中不足、曹秋亭嫌遲一脚、萬象華心與願違、李義臣一無成就、最出色者、前鋒之中推陳家球、中綫推顧尚勷、小戴中鋒、不减本色、以球勢言、大半操縱在東華之手、上半時中、進攻之機會、數不可計、不爲守門所救、即失之稍慢、或脚頭稍徧、卒於第四十五分鐘、射進敵網、下半時十分鐘內、復連陷二關、英尼斯全軍、遂瓦解而不堪再起、在緩和之空氣中、戴中鋒再作驚人之舉、以四對零大奏凱歌焉、兩軍出塲之陣綫如下</p>
<p>東華會</p>
<p>陸鍾恩李　寗關洵顧尚勵馮運佑陳洪光萬象華李義臣戴麟經陳家球曹秋亭</p>
<p>英尼斯</p>
<p>史梅頓麥金丹J麥考洛高納爾湯姆生麥克法萊柯林士開　萊麥考洛莫哈侖墨蘭</p>
<p>十二碼球徒然虚驚</p>
<p>三時既屆、馬許爾鳴笛開球、東華先攻、李義臣未帶球員證、阻於大門不得入、球已撥到、李尚遲於內外也、五分鐘後、方姗姗來、及既接觸、混戰移時、並未見驚人之舉、萬象華首先失機、李義臣得角來之球、亦越木外、以中堅湯姆生之失脚、李義臣傳曹秋亭、失之太遲、一刻鐘時、陳洪光與墨蘭同時受傷出、移時陳入、墨蘭則蹺其脚以終、球在中綫來往者凡十餘分鐘、局勢陷入沉悶、陸鍾恩救出一險球後、繼見蹺脚墨蘭提足傳中、球至中央、麥考洛跳起欲射、不料陳洪光在此關頭、從後欲救球、反而犯規、判罰十二碼、晴天霹靂、大禍驟臨、由麥考洛主踢、一脚飛去、恰在正中、落入陸鍾恩之手而撲出、長脚接連加上一脚、球遂脱險、萬人鼓掌、聲震雲霄、</p>
<p>守門雖妙終於落網</p>
<p>此後之十五分鐘、祇是史梅頓表演其出神入化之妙技、恃得滿塲掌聲、東華既脱此十二碼球之險、開始猛襲、以麥金丹之失足、馮運佑傳李義臣、在一極困難之地位中、史梅頓竟能一俯之間、將李球抱出、陳家球蹋任意球、萬家華傳戴麟經、一頂之下、又未見效、繼而家球必中之二百磅砲彈式之射門、亦落史梅頓之手、一而再、再而三、不可計、妙無窮、但狡兎雖有三窟、終於落入我網也、在上半時之最後一分鐘、馮運佑傳萬象而球入中路、小戴策口盤進、穿過一擋、已到門前、拉起一脚、史梅頓欲救而球已進網、上半時一對零、</p>
<p>勢如破竹接二連三</p>
<p>休息後、英尼斯開球不遠、曹氏刦得、交與義臣、混入射球區域、臥射一記、未能立功、未幾義臣得洪光輸送、再度探門、又成幻夢、莫哈倫開萊乘虚進襲、貼地射門、大陸足部有靈、碎然彈出、秋亭迂廻深入、一脚傳中、戴中鋒被人看守、無法脱身、秋亭沿邊襲進、家球隨後深入、球達中央、顧尚勷在三十碼之後、如飛趕到、對門遥射、竟恰中敵門上木而彈下過綫、時僅開球五分鐘、又二分鐘、萬象華趕到門前、傳中與戴、再傳家球在此極短促之時間中、陳家球舉行重腿、猛射而進、東華頓時造成直落三之鉅數、</p>
<p>臨去秋波阿戴再中</p>
<p>局勢䭓轉直下之後、遂趨平淡、英尼斯既如驚弓之鳥、東華亦不再爲已甚、惟曹秋亭與湯姆生搶球之結果、竟陷秋亭之足踝以重傷、經扶救出、聞傷勢不小、亦屬大不幸、東華雖以十人應戰、但綽有餘裕、英尼斯已零零碎碎、不堪再起、最後之五分鐘、顧尚勷傳球與碼、馮穿過麥考洛而達戴、戴臨去秋波、再以巧妙之力掃、第四次擊破史梅頓之門、以四對零大勝、</p>
<h3>優游戰勝西商</h3>
<p>結果五對二</p>
<p>東華方以四對零勝英尼斯於逸園、而優游亦以五對二敗英商於申園、好訊佳音、同時並聞、可謂雙喜臨門矣、申園優游與英商之役、觀者不若逸園之熱鬧、但在雙方人馬騰越之間、亦尚足以賞心而悦目、優游孫錦順最先立功、時在開賽後三十五分鐘左右、上半時遂以一對零告段落、下半時優游若輕車就熟路、一再占領敵壘、雖大本營二次失落、然所獲倍之、故結果優游五對二獲勝、</p>
<p>錦順一球開紀錄　優游開球不利、反受敵方侵襲、鍾勇森賴其輕捷身段、挾球沿右邊猛入、育祥中路接應、舉脚叩門、力弱斜出、攻勢仍在、連來王南珍二次角球、惜均失效、西商受兹壓廹、力圖抵抗、暗中積極、佈置反攻路綫、未幾、驚險緊張之局面、乃反現優游球門之前、楊守門頗爲活動、惟其中辛克萊門前一頂、令其大吃一驚、賽後猶覺談虎色變、鍾氏忽來解圍、引兵反攻、陳鎭祥羅海光相率進展、越山跨海、孫錦順鐵腿有靈、打破敵營、上半時乃得以一對零占先、</p>
<p>再接再厲定勝局　再戰聲中、優游生氣勃然、五分鐘內、鍾氏飛入陣中、引虎離山、孫錦順再度打中、成二對零、中央開球未久、鍾氏右邊傳來、錦順側讓與羅海光一身是膽、匹馬打關、寸許之差、中柱彈還、錦順不容坐視、振臂疾進、又告凱旋、西商三度失守、全軍奮起、左翼福洛士擋過雲逢　、巧避江善敬、邊角底綫、鈎向中央、辛克萊隨影逐至、全力射出、楊守門雙手拍出、球未入門、而辛氏已倒跌於網中矣、其時險象尚在、福洛士又光臨、竟被其攻入、不料頃刻之間、梁樹棠亦打中一球、球蓋自鍾氏所傳者、優游乃以四對一占勝、西商又以大軍進團、因打甚烈、楊持球跑四歩、被罰任意球、離門僅三碼、防守有方、得以無恙、觀者莫不爲優游慶幸、江善敬速送一球、中路三將長驅直入、西商空城無守、反救不及、眼看谷特金束手無策、羅海光單槍入營、成五對一、相距四分鐘、辛克萊一馬當先飛奔而來、江氏拒之失當爲其打入一球、而成當日五對二優游勝利之結果、</p>

<h3>中華足球會昨日盃賽</h3>
<p>羣華二比零勝毅勇　昨日羣華與毅勇作乙組盃賽於虹口公園第二塲、裁判員胡宗藩、雙方實力平均、戰來異常緊張、羣華前呼後應、合作較佳、上半時卒以絶妙之傳遞、兩度搗破毅勇龍門、下半時毅勇鄧志揚統率三軍、極力反攻、無奈羣華後衛堅强、朱炯培蕭國榮、應付得當、屢能化險爲夷、嗣後雙方各無進展、銀角一鳴、羣華遂以二對○勝、獲得複賽權矣、</p>
<p>嶺南八比一勝友華　中華足球乙組杯賽、嶺南對友華之戰、於十二時在麥根路球塲舉行、裁判員陸翔千、上半時嶺南前鋒五虎直撲龍門、十分鐘內連入二球、下半時嶺南陣綫更動、聯絡益妙、一氣呵成六、球後以後衛犯規、被罰十二碼、友華始得打破鴨蛋紀錄、總結果八對一、嶺南大捷、</p>

<p>中體聯足球錦標賽第二週比賽之期、原訂於本月二十四日舉行、嗣因與江大比賽（光華對復旦衝突、經雙方同意、提前一日於二十三日在光華操塲舉行、結果光華附中以二對零克服復實、裁判員夏建國、又民立對持志一塲、結果二比零民立勝、</p>
<p>昨日午後二時半浦東與復中作中體聯足球賽於復中球塲、因雨後地滑、踢來無甚精彩、浦東以攻守得法、聯絡較佳、取得勝利、上半時以一比○佔先、下半時復以連中三元告捷、結果四比零、裁判員倪孝本、</p>

<p>沿途保護愼重其事</p>
<p>該會、對此次沿途保護運動員之手續、極完備而嚴整、每一英里終點處、均有童子軍揚旗示路、而每與一賽員在中途前進時、均有自由車妥爲領導、同時公共租界及法租界捕房、亦派出大批探警往來逡廵、以防不測、故運動員至要道口時、輒能在人潮洶湧中平安過去、</p>
<p>路人圍觀情緒熱烈</p>
<p>起點處在七時左右、曙光迷茫中、即見觀衆四方來歸、七時半愈聚愈衆、至開歩時、同孚路静安寺路口、無慮三四千人、静安寺右側、携老携幼、環堵而觀者、亦人山人海、他如交大門前、虹橋路貝當路、亦均擠軋不堪、沿途總計算之、何祇三四萬人、</p>
<p>發令開歩恐後爭先</p>
<p>槍聲響處、一百餘條大腿、一齊閃動、一窠蜂向西進發、一號張鴻生與十九號朱聲遠、放開大歩、生龍活虎、悍然撇下衆人、作羣龍之首、到極司菲而路漸分眉目、鄭成山以極平常老練之歩伐、超出餘子、昂頭天外、范强心高志大緊追不捨、王經仁亦虎虎有生氣、足下生風、居第三位、此後强顯崙與楊德潤、二馬奔馳、各不稍讓、談榮生則我行我素、歩伐非常穩健、與錢啟明幾乎訂生死之交、五英里没有分過手、挨肩邁進、好看煞人、</p>
<p>貝當路上小鄭神威</p>
<p>轉瞬間即抵虹橋路火車口、范强咬牙切齒、一着不讓、反顧鄭成山則離范不過五公尺、低首無言、向前躦路、過交通大學、達貝當路、鄭成山見范鼓作氣、並無疲憊之態、暗暗喫驚、脚底加油、拚　命追去、將及辣斐德路時、鄭已如脱繮野馬、怒往無前、周則照本居於十名之後、因其腿力豐富、實爲餘子所不及、達亞爾培路時、已由第十三名昇入前十名、與王經仁張顯崙輩爲伍、此時一二兩名、已離大衆很遠、轉膠州路直撲申園、</p>
<p>終點人多掌聲雷震</p>
<p>十時零二分三十秒、報馬飛來、大軍已到、三千觀衆翹首側目、爲首一將、高視闊歩、衝折而來、正是海陸空柱石鄭成山是也、不旋踵范强氣急敗壞、隨後跟來、談榮生咬牙怒目、掙得第三、張顯崙位居第五、走畢頻向人言、並未喫力、此公本錢不小、可畏之材也、移時三多之和合二聖、催馬趕到、錢啟明額角汗珠、涔然直下、楊德潤因王經仁眈眈其後、極爲不安、雖得第六、亦良苦矣、去年名登虎榜位列第四之小將姚亞影、今年帶病出馬、雖在十名之外、其志殊足嘉矣、迨老蟹葛精康坌息報到、恰已開到茶縻、花事將了、</p>
<p>女子競走隨後舉行</p>
<p>男子競走員完全到達終點後、女子競走亦隨之舉行、參加者二十二人、均能走完路程、到達終點、可喜可賀、事前一般均料冠軍不出林韻芬張雪沙二人、庸知徐小姐仲纂身高力大、歩伐穩重、不慌不忙、搶得首座、極爲觀衆所贊美、第一圈李文華郭品珍頗有作爲、徐小姐則與林韻芬在第二集團中、胡香棣在第三集團中、第二圈徐小姐歩伐如一、始終不　、而先後位置、亦無大上落、第三圈徐小姐稍露鋒芒、由第二集團昇入一　之未、四圈將終時、始大展身手、黄衣女郎林韻芬與之並駕齊趨、火辣辣地向前趕路、轉眼將賀益榮陸長緻輩、撤在腦後、五圈六圈、徐小姐一邁往前、林韻芬因勢力不加、終難與此胭脂虎爭衡、胡香棣幸在三四圈中、爭得不少地盤、此時雖已香汗涔涔、嬌喘不勝、差喜後來者亦如君疲憊、因是得以保持亞軍位置、第三四名范陸二人競爭殊烈、歩伐活躍輕鬆、實爲可造之材、他若華東老將張平復、與夫上中新人凌月華、雖名落深山均能奮鬥到底、是則女子競走史册中、不可不代書者也</p>
<p>致詞之後繼以給奬</p>

<h3>虹橋路上日僑逞能白虹竟遭敗北</h3>
<p>日僑加藤之標槍五一米八九</p>
<p>貽澤杯轉移半年</p>
<p>白虹·日僑·俄僑之國際三角運動會、於昨日下午二時在虹橋路同文書院舉行、俄僑臨時未到、祗餘白虹日僑演成對抗局面、白虹不幸被挫、惟各項成績則尚見精彩、總結果六十四比三十七、</p>
<p>無敵軍首次被挫　白虹隊挾上海田徑最優秀之人才、成軍以來、除友誼比賽外、正規作戰、每戰必勝、享有無敵威名、聲振海內、昨日出師虹橋路、不意竟受敗挫、按此次項目、僅有十種、二百、八百、萬米、兩欄、撑竿、均付闕如、實使白虹大蒙不利、而爲致命之傷、</p>
<p>論成績彼進我退　白虹開始點名、主將程金冠未到、帥位虚懸、全隊頓失重心、孫惠培符保廬王永民亦未出塲、軍容渙散、敗兆已呈、回溯第一屆運動會、白虹鐵騎横行、摧枯拉朽、無往不利、日僑成績幼稚、且遠在俄僑之下、今則小松、高橋、加藤等輩、成績飛躍驚人、我方諸將望塵莫及、彼進我退、儼如二十年來速運形勢、可勝慨歎、</p>
<p>貽澤杯斷送半載　對抗閉幕、日僑以六十四對三十七之比、大獲勝利、奪獲錦標、大會奬品、燦爛光輝之貽澤杯、本屆遂落於日僑之日、全體隊員、黯然神傷、白虹若思奪回此杯、須待來年春季、再形努力、</p>
<p>長頸鹿四百稱雄　陳明良四百米、昨爲白虹爭得面子不少、陳起歩後、爲日僑三將所包圍、迨轉灣後、始奪圍而出、一路遥領、直撲終點、成績五十四秒二、以三百米跑道有此、至爲不易</p>
<p>跳澗虎三級失利　跳澗虎張嘉夔、獲勝於跳遠、竟失利於三級跳、足見敵軍兇猛、小松於第四跳已達十三米七三、是時嘉夔尚在十三米三十、其後雖進至十三米四五、仍無濟於事、至於跳遠、岡以六米五七、小松以六米四六、追隨亦緊、</p>
<p>戰三鐵敵勢益張　鐵球巨人沈惟善、失敗於小松之手、良可歎息、鐵餅高橋小松歩歩爭先、我方僅呈追隨之勢、標槍唐賢　竭盡心力、加藤驍勇異常、恐彭永嚴南下、亦難獲勝也、</p>
<p>長短跑繼續失機　百米岡榮獲鮝頭、薛劍秋成績亦富麗異常、與岡相差一米許、當時計時爲十一秒三、一千五百米白虹五將均落後、前田最後衝刺有力、極爲美觀、兹錄全部成績如下、</p>

<h3>從贛南新復匪區中之救護工作談到公家施診制（五）</h3>
<p>— 龐京周先生講陳生白江晦鳴筆記</p>
<p>我們如要設立縣立施診所，假定一縣的人民有十五萬。敷設施診所一二處，每天診治病人三百號，那末，在五百人民裏頭，就有一人可享有一天一次就醫的權利。照上面每號平均醫藥費一角二分來推算，每年的代價是一萬三千一百四十元，平均該縣每一人增加負擔，不過八分七厘六毫。即使要人民共同來負担，則較之四川的徵糧徵到民國四十幾年。和此間什麽田賦的附加咧，全國公債的負擔咧，一切苛捐雜税咧，實在便宜得多。只可惜我國的百姓，納了警捐，竟没有財産上的保障，而納了一切苛捐，還得不到生命上一些醫藥的享受，真可謂可憐之至。</p>
<p>我且不厭求詳的，摘錄美國近年的幾行統計，來做一個比較：</p>
<p>醫藥費爲三五七七百萬——平均每人每年爲五元九角</p>
<p>酒烟冰淇淋費爲三○七四百萬</p>
<p>個人裝飾費爲二六九八百萬</p>
<p>衣服費爲九三一五百萬</p>
<p>由此可知美國的衣服費和醫藥費的比例，約爲三比一。那麽，在中國富庶之省縣人民，每年的衣服費，總遠不止三角錢。假如爲三元，則醫藥費的擔負假定爲什之一，亦可得三角道。此中除高等自由醫藥之外，以八分七厘支配入公醫費用，那裏是絶對不可能的嗎？</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>從上面所有的事實，可以歸納到一個結論：</p>
<p>要推廣中國的醫藥，要用捷徑普及中國的科學新醫。應當從鄉村入手，爲鄉村着想。中國科學的事業之所以糟到如此，爲的是没有獨立的精神。往往隨世界形勢，與本國政治人物而消長變遷。譬如自從世界大戰以後，美國做了世界的盟主，而中國的政治人物，也跟着轉移。一般的所謂科學家醫學家，也跟了中國的政治轉移而轉移。其結果徒然於都市裏發生許多富於模仿性的巨頭領袖。政治如此、一般科學如此、醫藥問題未嘗不如此。</p>
<p>我們應當覺悟，巨頭眼光所看不到的，我們就應該因看到而由我們來注意，由我們來提出，我們去力行。國內醫學家裏頭，不乏懂事務識大體的人們，而無所謂學派學系的。只要有切合國情的眼光，我們就引爲同志。竭誠竭智的共同來走我們應努力之路。我們應努力所走的路，乃是鄉村崎嶇的小路，不是都市間的大道，大道雖寛，人多則擠；小路最艱，久之則闢。</p>
<p>然而惟其走崎嶇的小路，到要有資格，有眼光，有能耐的方好走。並不是説，到內地去的醫家，到鄉村去的醫家，就是次一等的人物。例如到鄉村去辦醫院，既要獨當一面，又無一切借鏡，如果與公家辦事，又要節省公欵，又要妥籌制宜有效的方法、又要有好的操守，來以身作則，然後可以創造良好的環境，保持新醫的信譽，其地位的淸高，廻非都市的醫家可以空言藏拙，隨俗阿時的可比。</p>
<p>像這樣品學兼優，眼光遠大，立志爲中國醫學前途，闢開光明廣坦出路的同志，鄙人實有望於今日的東南醫學院的濟濟多才。—完了—</p>
<h3>淮陰衛生醫藥狀况談（上）</h3>
<p>— 徐放游</p>
<p>（一）引言　淮陰（又名淸江浦）蕞爾小邑。位於江蘇北部之中心。南貫揚通。北連徐海。於軍事上，政治上，頗占重要地位。在不久以前。當高唱全國縮小省區時。曾一度有江淮省府設於淮陰之呼聲。我邦人士。諒復記憶。此地在前淸有漕督，提督，在民初有都督，軍使等重要大員。駐節於此。五方雜處。風氣半開。各種新興事業。具體而微。兹請以衛生醫藥狀况言之。</p>
<p>（二）衛生行政　衛生行政在吾中國。本屬幼稚。淮陰於民初警察總局時代。設有衛生科。其任務亦不過淸道及管理垃圾桶小便池而已。及至黨國以還。則附屬於公安局第二科。雖於上述三種任務外。至夏季則勒令飲食店加蓋紗罩。以避蚊蠅。臨時集欵購置痧水等項以防疫。然皆有名無實。撑撑塲面。至於實際各種管理及取締等事。一未奉行。别無足述。恐此種現象。非獨淮陰一地爲然也。</p>
<p>惟地方衛生團體組織。在民十三年。有一淸江浦衛生會。地點設在紅十字會淸江浦分會內。當時係會長制。會長劉鼎新。曾向淮陰縣公署立案。其內容編制如何。不復記憶。惟其主要工作。彰彰在人耳目者。厥爲多僱打掃夫。從事淸道。其次則於夏季購置臭水。分洒小便池。再其次則購置滬上中華衛生教育會之衛生小册子。從事散佈宣傳等等。成立三年。得欵七百餘元。終以欵絀而告中止。</p>
<p>後於民十九年。復又有淮陰縣衛生會之組織。地點設在縣建設局原址。該會係委員制。主席委員徐牧湖。該會除向當地黨政機關立案外。並向江蘇民政廳，及國民政府內政部備案。其內容編制。分總務，宣傳，調查，醫療等四股。其已過之主要工作。爲春秋期推廣種痘。夏季注射防疫針。參加夏冬兩季淸潔大掃除。及淮陰各界衛生運動。編印淺近衛生傳單。從事宣傳。並隨時調查地方衛生不良狀况。督促公安局注意執行。成立二年。得欵二百零元。後因欲於衛生事業。有所推進。曾與淮陰城南大戲院。商妥二分戲捐。以資發展。乃因備案問題。請於淮陰縣長賀宙生。經提交縣政會議遭否决。請於江蘇民政廳長胡樸安。復遭駁斥。因此遂無法進行。不得不告停頓。此乃淮陰衛生史上一頁之陳蹟也。</p>
<p>（三）新醫業　內地人民。對於新醫診病。必至醫院。故私人設診所者甚少。即有之。亦必掛醫院招牌。淮陰城門內外大小醫院。計六七處。最大者爲美教會所設立之仁慈醫院。該院成立於前淸光緒二十四年。其初在河北大街霸子口耶穌堂內。規模不大。後乃於東圩門水渡口。購地自行建築三層洋樓五幢。平屋百餘間。共有普通男病牀二一六張。女病牀一○六張。另專設黑熱病院一座。計有病牀一五二張。於民國二年遷入。該院院長。爲美醫鍾仁溥氏。（Dr.　L.　Bell）全院有美籍醫師三人。華醫師四人。（無女醫師）男護士三十二人。女護士十七人。門診每日平均約二百號。全年住院病人約三千至三千五百名。黑熱病院全年約診治三千人。院臨曠野。空氣淸新。內中各科設備俱有。該院在淮陰固堪首屈一指、即在淮北醫院中。亦不多見。該院係半慈善性質。對於真貧者。亦能實行其仁慈也。</p>
<p>次爲私人醫院。如德霖醫院，淸江醫院，俊生醫院走。其設備上均難合於醫院之條件。他若博濟，鼎濟兩醫院。則診所之變相耳。</p>
<p>在民二十一年。陳調元氏第一軍駐紥淮陰時。由其軍醫處人員。在城南公園之傍。組織一民衆醫院。設備甚簡。收費較廉。及至陳氏第一軍去。而江蘇保安隊第一團來。其團部軍醫人員。仍在原址繼續辦理。未多時而第一團復他調。繼以第二團。該醫院院址。適於此時爲衛生署黑熱病研究隊所得。而民衆醫院之名字。即從此告停矣。</p>
<p>淮陰向無公欵設立之新醫施診機關。惟在民十九年。曾由淸江紅十字分會。向各界募集捐欵。於夏季臨時延請新醫。辦理施醫給藥。爲期僅三月。終以欵絀。未能繼續。至今年夏。始有省立淸江民教館。繼前淮陰縣衛生會之後。免費推廣注射防疫針。以從事防疫云。</p>
<p>（四）新藥業　淮陰新藥業共十家。計有中西兩號，中外，濟緣，華美等五家。係專營藥業。餘如五洲，中法，中英，中美，濟華堂等。則以販賣廣貨爲大宗。而售藥次之。即上述五家專營藥業者。亦均無正式藥劑師可以配方調劑。好在內地凡新醫診病。率皆自行配藥。否則甚不便也。</p>
<p>惟有一事。頗覺不合。即注射針藥。可以拆封零售。有一次有一友人。在其藥房自購已拆封之果乃金（Gonorgin）一合之餘數。前來請爲注射。細察之。乃係過期之物。隨時令其退還掉換。此種事不知該藥房是否有心。然不得不歸咎於衛生行政上管理之無人也。該業公會。係與舊藥業合併。加入商會爲會員。（未完）</p>
<h3>疾病常識問答</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（四十五）胃潰瘍（下）</p>
<p>（問）胃潰瘍的時候，吐出的血，呈什麽色澤？</p>
<p>（答）吐出的血，大都因爲胃內有鹽酸的關係，呈褐黑色。</p>
<p>（問）如果胃內的血液，並不吐出，而從大便中排泄的時候，呈什麽色澤？</p>
<p>（答）如果胃內的出血，從大便中排泄的時候，便呈黑挔煤膏狀的外觀。</p>
<p>（問）胃內出血，大概有多少分量？</p>
<p>（答）並不一定。多的時候，可以到一公升的。少的時候，也有少到目力所不能見，而成所謂潛在性出血的。</p>
<p>（問）胃出血，有没有生命上的危險？</p>
<p>（答）如果出了多量的血，當然可以致命。否則也要起著明的貧血症狀，像眩暈，耳鳴，欠伸，眼華閃發，頭痛，全身倦怠，皮膚蒼白，頻脈等症狀。</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>（問）患胃潰瘍的人，食慾有没有减退？</p>
<p>（答）食慾，普通都很佳良。祇有因爲怕發胃痛，所以不敢多吃。</p>
<p>（問）病人的舌苔，有無變化？</p>
<p>（答）没有多少舌苔。大者平滑帶赤色。</p>
<p>（問）胃潰瘍假使痊愈之後，有無貽留胃的變形？</p>
<p>（答）有的，因爲潰瘍結成的瘢痕而起幽門狹窄，或在胃體中部起絞窄而致成爲葫蘆形胃。也有在瘢痕部肥厚而起胼胝。或胃周圍的愈着。</p>
<p>（問）胃潰瘍的診斷，應該怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）若固有的症狀存在，那末很容易診斷。凡中年人的吐血，往往是由於胃潰瘍。若胃痛發作在食後三十分至一小時的，那末潰瘍在小彎部。若胃痛在食後一二小時以上的，那末潰瘍是在幽門部。</p>
<p>（問）本病的預後，是怎樣的？</p>
<p>（答）大概雖能完全治愈，然往往要貽留日後的障礙，像持續的胃痛，葫蘆形胃，幽門狹窄，胃周圍愈着等。</p>
<p>（問）胃潰瘍的治療，至少要多少日子，纔得治愈？</p>
<p>（答）至少要持續二三星期的正當治療可以治愈。</p>
<p>（問）治療的一般方針，有那幾點？</p>
<p>（答）有四點：就是（一）對於大出血時的急治，（二）非出血時的食養，（二）保護包被潰瘍面和（四）使胃酸减少或中和。</p>
<p>（問）對於大出血時的急治，應該怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）應該使病人絶對安静，仰臥，絶食，止吐；一二星期後給以流動食。檢查糞便有無潛在性出血，等到没有出血痕跡之後，纔得歩行。</p>
<p>（問）非出時的食養，應該怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）病人祇許飲用牛乳，食雞卵，砂糖，烤餅，奶油，麵包，細切肉，糊粥等。避忌一切刺㦸性食物，禁烟酒辛辣和炭酸飲料。</p>
<p>（問）保護包被潰瘍的方法，是怎樣的？</p>
<p>（答）內服收歛性藥物像次硝酸鉍，次没食子酸鉍，Neutralon硝酸銀等都宜。</p>
<p>（問）使胃酸减少或中和的方法，是怎樣的？</p>
<p>（答）內服鹼性藥劑像重炭酸鈉，煆製鎂，炭酸鈣，人工卡爾斯泉鹽等，都可中和胃酸。用油（洋橄欖油）的內服，却能减少分泌，並能緩解疼痛，包被潰瘍面。</p>
<h3>大衆「杯」</h3>
<p>— 黄貽淸</p>
<p>非用噴飲的方式不可。</p>
<p>「渴者」也似乎未易爲飲！</p>
<p>語文，要大衆化（這在原則上總還説得去）；杯，要反「大衆化」。「大衆杯」，要使大衆公用了，同時還能隔絶「大衆」化。換句話説，要教大衆合用了飲器，前後人底嘴巴却不致因了飲器間接的接觸，搭染着些致病生物——傷風，流行性感冒，白喉，腥紅熱，以及梅毒等等染性病的致病生物。</p>
<p>實際情形是這樣的：在健康公衆的道夥裏，杯給大衆公用着，本亦何妨。不過每個公衆的健康，誰能時時給他保證？只須偶然有個把菌郵或是能够行走的染性病人一塊兒在亂用着，可就糟啦。你瞧：街頭施茶亭或是車夫飲茶處鏈條兒繫着的茶杯，使得嗎？可是在這種情况之下，大衆的口渴問題，還是不能不解决。「喝」和「拉」，和撒，自有一般的需要；隨便喝，自身所受到的危害，却比隨便拉，隨便撒都嚴重。街頭是這樣，多人聚集的所在，像學校，院所，工廠，大商店，萃賣塲，遊戲塲，以及廣塲，公園，車站（要是地方上有的話）等等去處，也都是這樣。大衆要穩穩妥妥地一夥兒想法解渴，却只有在這許多塲所裝着大衆適用的噴飲器，收飲料水臨空噴流着，給人啜飲。</p>
<p>關於噴飲器底裝置，在民八，民九之際，歐美老早有人談到，水流直噴的，啜餘的水回浴到噴口，仍舊有使噴口受病菌沾染的危險——傳播疾病，和公用杯一般無二。所以認定教水流斜噴，最是玲巧不過。近年美國根據衛生會底條陳，規定設計衛生噴餘泉應有的標準，尤其精審；有如左列：</p>
<p>（一）噴飲器要用不透水的物質像細瓷器，瓷器，塗秞鐵，其他金屬或陶器建造。</p>
<p>（二）噴口要用不氧化，不透水的物質構成；並且要使水流從一角依垂直的方向射出。噴口和自來水管通到噴口的合泉眼，都要高出盆邊，以便盆下排水管偶或阻塞時，廢水得不致泛濫到噴口和泉眼上。</p>
<p>（三）噴口的盡頭處要接裝着不氧化的護口罩，政防就飲的人接觸噴口。</p>
<p>（四）水流從噴口斜射而出，要使接觸不到護口罩，以免潑散。</p>
<p>（五）噴泉盆應使不致位於不易糞除或堆積穢物的屋角牆隅。</p>
<p>（六）噴泉盆要使水流落到盆裏，不致飛濺。</p>
<p>（七）噴飲器底排水管，要用鐵網障隔了管口，才好連接到陰溝管去。</p>
<p>（八）噴飲器底自來水管裏，要裝個靈活的活瓣，和寛鬆的開關，或是裝個自動活瓣，藉使就飲的人調節水流，得旋轉自如。</p>
<p>（九）就飲處高出地面的高度，要使極便就飲者的飲。宜築幾個階座，使身長不等的兒童們都得就飲。</p>
<p>（十）陰溝管底開口和管身的大小，要足使廢水立時排盡。管口要裝一隔座器。</p>
<p>可憐在我國，大家還只知「渴者」多們「易飲」，施茶市惠，自鳴得意。即使此中利弊，有人也早已明白，反正這個年節，經濟那麽窮困，對於要化錢的衛生設備，委實有些望洋興歎，不敢領教。這種標準的大衆杯，各地不知要到什麽年代，才會靠着自己的力量，裝出幾個來玩玩——租界底公園和學校裏，有的早有這種設備，可惜是人家裝的——？現在我們怕也只得風吹别調地把時髦的「大衆」給「杯」做幌子；只得牢記着「不用」的主意，出門在外，不是遇到可靠的杯子，寗可不渴吧！</p>
<p>至於噴飲泉用的都是沙濾水，到了寒季，怕國人不耐冷飲，這却不是個挺嚴重的問題。但看上海特區裏所謂華童公學底學生，塞季也都用得好好的，並沒什麽不慣，也從未鬧過亂子，便可知道。萬一國人對於這特別靈敏的「寒暖覺」未能忘情，不忍拋棄，那末沙濾之後，也儘可預先加溫，然後噴出。不過這裏的加溫，非另有調節的設備不可罷了。這是後話，不多贅。</p>
<h3>發熱普通治療法（九）</h3>
<p>— 李興</p>
<p>三，撒水退熱法</p>
<p>這是一種很簡單的治法。病床褥上護以油布或油紙，上舖被單。病人額上先加一冷濕毛巾。用冷水（六十度）先撒在兩臂上，兩大腿上繼撒在身上。用一隻手撒水，一隻手摩擦。摩擦至發熱再撒冷水。撒時要特別多撒在背上，因為背是退熱最要緊的部分。如此撒水直到熱度降低，但不要降低之一○一度之下。若是摩擦時皮膚不覺得熱也就可以停止。停止時將濕被單拿去，病人睡在乾被內。病人若是很強壯最後也不必擦乾。病人若是不強壯可以把他先擦乾再叫他睡在乾被內。病人若是容易受激刺可不必一次撒水洗全身，可撒水在身之一部分，一部分洗好了蓋好，再洗一部分。</p>
<p>神經特别容易受激刺的，與兒童可不必用以上方法。可先用一○五度水（熱水）以毛巾洗身，次用温度一百度的火酒擦身。注意熱火酒不可在火上熱，將火酒放在熱水內熱到一百度。病人若熱度很高，水與火酒溫度漸降低直等得到相當效果。以上是一種很平和性的水療法用之得當裨益也很不小。</p>
<p>四，濕被單浴法</p>
<p>病人熱很高時，可用一濕被單把他包在內。被單是從八十度或五十度的水中扭出。這些温度可照病人強弱斷定。强者用五十度水亦無不可。弱者可用八十度水逐漸換冷水直到病人溫度降至一○一度爲止。病人包在濕被單內，外再在被單上酒水。被單熱了再洒水，到溫度降低為止。末了照病人身體強弱或擦乾或不擦乾，後換在乾被內。</p>
<p>身體强壯的病人也可以用噴水法。將病人身下用油布或油紙墊好，把頭部分的床墊高約一尺。床脚頭用一盆接水。用一噴水器細細噴水在病人身上。一隻手也要摩擦。病人身體不發熱或溫度降到一○一度就可以停止。</p>
<p>五，半身浴</p>
<p>半身浴就是將浴缸盛水，病人坐缸內水達到肚臍。缸內浴爲不能動的成人不免有些麻煩。但是别種方法效果不大滿意時，這是特别有效的。爲小孩子這是很方便的。半身浴可分爲以下幾種照病人的病狀採取適宜的。（一）温水浴（水温九十五度）兼摩擦身體五分鐘，繼用冷水（七十五度）擦，末了擦乾。（二）若要效騐來的快可用七十五度水浴十分鐘兼摩擦身體，末用冷水（六十度）擦頸，胸前後，再輕輕擦乾。（三）一個軟弱發熱的病人，若是他的皮膚發白發冷，心跳很快，可用熱水（一○五度）五分鐘，等他皮膚發紅了再向他身嘖冷水（七十五度）後擦乾。</p>
<p>六，全身浴</p>
<p>全身浴即病人坐在缸內水可達到頸處。如果没有這樣深的缸，水達到肩亦可。這種全身浴必須另外摩擦身體。全身浴可分爲以下兩種：（一）漸冷浴，即先將缸盛九十度水大半缸。先洗兼摩擦到皮膚發紅時加一桶冷水（注意冷水不可直接潑在病人身上）如此漸冷水到七十五或七十度。末了用六十度水擦頭頸後部。（二）全身冷水浴，是一種很有效力的退熱法。這種浴法最好由水温八十五度起兼摩擦身體。水漸加冷到七十五度或六十度，以病人强弱爲斷。病人若還是發熱很高，每小時或四小時浴一次。病人在水中的時候亦可由數鐘到十分鐘，即强的病人洗十分鐘，弱的病人酌量减短。（未完）</p>
<h3>肺結核淺說（三十）</h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>第八章　臨床檢查法</p>
<p>最後，對於肺部空洞的診斷，也連帶在此處略述一下。像有一定範圍的鼓音，壺性呼吸音，大水泡和有響的水泡音，都是有診斷上之價值的；但僅靠打診聽診手續未證明，是有附帶的兩個條件的。第一，空洞須達到一定的容積，太小是没有辦法的。第二，他的所在須接近肺之表面；假使在肺的深處，周圍給含氣肺組織所包圍的話，也是無從證明的。進一歩的辦法，自不能不借徑於Ｘ光的透視了！關於這方面的情形，都另詳見下面。</p>
<p>（三）痰的檢查　肺結核的真確診斷，自莫過於痰中結核菌的證明了；這是本症唯一的原因，在第一章裏面已經詳述過的。他是一樁極重要的檢查工作醫家對於病者，萬萬不可忽略過的。並且有好多本症，在聽診打診工作還没有明顯認識的時候，在痰中已可發現結核菌（尤以淸晨的痰）了！這是誰也料不到的。從另一方面説，我們也可以曉得：此種工作在本病早期診斷上是如何緊要的了。—醫者擔任此種工作，第一步手續是痰的取到，這照例在事實上是狠容易辦到的；但有時也會發生困難的。因爲有好些病者是僅有乾咳而無痰排除的，特殊是忠初期本症的人們是如此的。醫者應付此種困難的方法，第一步可用尋常的祛痰劑，這方面最相宜的是碘劑溶液。如果達不到目的，不妨藉喉鏡的助力，用棉花輕擦喉部，以取到棉花材料，此時的病者當然會發生咳嗽的；這方面的是非有無的檢查報告，大抵是狠靠得住的。但在小孩方面，仍然是萬分困難，他們的痰大半是下嚥及胃的，這是醫者們應該特殊留意的地方。</p>
<h3>耳鼻喉眼衛生常識</h3>
<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（二十五）實扶的里（俗稱白喉）（續）</p>
<p>（甲）義膜性咽頭實扶的里Melnbranoese　Rachendiphtherie咽頭發赤腫脹。兩側扁桃腺腫大發赤。在一側或兩側扁桃腺的全面。被覆灰白色的義膜。義膜有時可以蔓延波及咽頭後壁，軟口蓋，和懸雍垂。此種義膜的固着力甚强。狠不容易剝離。剝離的時候。極易出血。這也是診斷實扶的里狠緊要的一點。鼻腔常發炎症現象。此時鼻腔的枯膜。大都腫脹。鼻汁的分泌。亦因此而增多。行嚥下作用的時候。非常疼痛。而感困難。對於發音。亦被障碍。有時變爲嘶嗄。在小兒，則屢呈呼吸困難。啼泣不安。頸部的淋巴腺。亦常腫脹。而有壓痛。體温大概在三十八度至三十九度的左右。</p>
<p>（乙）腺窩性咽頭實扶的里Laknnaere　Rachendiphtherie咽頭後壁，軟口蓋，懸雍垂，和扁桃腺。均潮紅腫脹。在一側或兩側扁桃腺的全面。被覆一個或幾個白色的點狀物。非常酷似扁桃腺炎所發的白點。但是本病的體温。並不像扁桃線炎的那樣高（四十度左右）。普通總在三十九度以下。這也是診斷這種實扶的里狼重要的一點。其餘的症候。大略的義膜性的相同。</p>
<p>在重症的時候。他的全身症狀。較爲重篤。亦可別為壞疽性和進行蔓延性的兩種。</p>
<p>（甲）壞疽性咽頭實扶的里Gangraenoese　Rachendiphtberie在咽頭形成著明的義膜。中央發生暗黑色的斑紋。義膜周圍的粘膜。爲暗赤色腫脹。多帶乾燥。往往蔓延及軟口蓋或懸雍垂。有時限局發生在咽頭後壁和扁桃腺的兩處。被義膜被覆的組織。常陷壞死。病人的一般全身症狀。亦陷於重篤的狀態。體温上昇。常達三十九度之上。頸部的淋巴腺。有時腫脹疼痛。有時竟可化膿。言語常帶鼻聲。口內放惡臭。嚥下作用亦告困難。</p>
<p>（乙）進行蔓延性咽頭實扶的里Progrediente　Rachendipbtherie這是一種最嚴重最可怕的一種咽頭實扶的里。他的危險。就是向附近各處進行蔓延。一面從扁桃腺蔓延到軟口蓋和懸雍垂。一面又可由上方蔓延到鼻腔。由下方蔓延到喉頭和氣管。普通要算蔓延到喉頭的時候最多。此時常發喉頭狹窄的症狀。病人陷入窒息的危險。蔓延的進行狼早。大概在發痛的第二天。即已發現。體温上昇。可達三十九度或四十度。病人漸次感覺體力的衰脱。陷於無慾的狀態。脈搏轉爲微弱緩慢不正。這個時候往往可以突然發生心臟麻痺而死。（未完）</p>

<h3>悲觀與樂觀</h3>
<p>— 向隅</p>
<p>庸俗而懷疑者，在二十世紀的三十年代，恐怕仍與十九世紀的三十年代的情形相彷彿，『庸俗者爲了他的庸俗而受苦，懷疑者爲了他的懷疑而受苦。』（見泰納英國文學史。）世界澎湃爲思潮，	啟發了我們的奢望，而没有把它們滿足，教道了我們許多方法，而我們無所適從，帶來了許多不幸，而我們無法解脱。悲觀者與樂觀者一樣，庸俗者與懷疑者一樣，意志堅定者與意志薄弱者一樣，相率走於彷徨的道途。有些人説是，有些人説不是，是與不是的呼聲，震驚我的神經；有的説已找到，有的説尚未找到，找到與不找到的呼聲，震驚我們的神經；有的説已有辦法，有的説尚無辦法，有辦法與無辦法的呼聲，震驚我們的神經。我們中有許多人，帶了這種創痕，消極地走往别的方向去求解脱不是的沉湎於酒，即是放縱於色，不是避入象牙之塔，即是冷潮熱駡。這是像駝鳥一樣，只藏了頭，尾露在外面又怎麽辦呢？</p>
<p>這種庸俗而懷疑者的世紀的痼疾，决不是那些庸俗人如法國席拉爾丁（Saint-marc　Girardin）的庸俗的辦法所能解决的。席拉爾丁曾勸告青年説：『不要認爲你自己高出於别人；接受普通生活，不要蔑視小的道德；那是唯一的好的道德，施的加爾Stagyre的魔鬼是憂鬱，或者更確切一點是缺乏精力與骨幹，是一種靈魂的否定。爲要去掉它，尊重規律的簡單的習慣，尊重日常的責任，與興趣，駕乎一切快樂之上。選擇一種職業，結婚與組織一個家庭，事實上没有憂鬱這魔鬼的，即是憂鬱魔鬼自身，也不敢在天真的小孩前面出現。』（見聖佩韋的M　Saint-marc　Girardin,Cariseries　Du　Luudi　Vol.　I）席拉爾丁的獨斷的唯心論的説教，根本没有抓住了問題的中心，世紀痼疾的到來，决不是個人內心的憂鬱之魔在作祟，也决不是找了一種職業與結婚可能解决，找了一個職業，討了一個老婆，説就能够解决一切問題，這簡直睡在鼓中講夢話。况且在目前這樣狀况之下，除開少數人之外，在歐洲資本主義已發展到最高程度的國家如德國在她的首都柏林，也有許多工人絶望地坐在街上，胸前掛着小方本牌，上面寫着「任何工作，我都願做」等字在上面。職業問題在目前既不是席拉爾丁所想像的那般容易找到，老婆問題當就也不是他所想像的那般容易解决了。</p>
<p>所以世紀痼疾的普遍化，個人本身是不任其咎的。然而庸俗者爲了他的庸俗而痛苦，懷疑者爲了他的懷疑而痛苦，這却是多餘的。這些庸俗而懷疑者，他們所以懷疑，也許他們没有認識苦悶的真因，没有摸着了解决苦悶的方法，也許認識了苦悶的真因，解决苦悶的方法，被過去情性的束縛，没有向前的勇氣。一個社會中的健全的分子，是不會懷疑，不會苦悶，不會傷感的。社會中有懷疑苦悶傷感的現象，這是轉變社會的特徵。社會在這時已劃成兩個時代了。有許多人代表前一代，有許多人代表後一代，而這些懷疑者，却既不是代表過去一代；也不是代表未來一代，是代表其間的動摇者，這些動摇者既不前進，又不後退，説他不知道，有些塲合，他許比誰都知道，説他没有决斷，有些塲合，比誰也有决斷，他們所以一方面憧憬未來，一方面而又戀戀過去者，就是他對於生活，没有勇氣，没有生活的勇氣，終必没落的，世界是有勇氣人的世界。奥柯塞（Sean　O'Casey）在他的戲劇在門內（Within　The　Gates）所歌詠的：</p>
<p>路只有給那些强壯的人敏捷的人，無畏的人走；</p>
<p>生命當中波動着對生命的恐懼的讓它死去；</p>
<p>讓它没落下去，讓它死去，讓它永遠從我們的眼中消逝。</p>
<p>憂愁與痛苦，我們一定將有，而掙扎一定也無窮境，</p>
<p>我們要把勇氣與痛苦打成一片，從不斷掙扎中開一條路。</p>
<p>路只有給那些强壯的人敏捷的人無畏的人走，</p>
<p>生命當中波動着對生命的恐懼的，讓它死去。</p>
<p>讓它没落下去讓它死去，讓它永遠從我們眼中消逝。</p>
<p>實道出轉換期人的應有的態度。有勇氣的人應該如斯，</p>
<h3>創作經騐</h3>
<p>— 淑明</p>
<p>有許多文藝家，他們爲應着市塲的需要，著作些像創作方法論小説法程之類的東西，用來做從事文學青年底初歩性的示範，他們所以這樣做，自然是一方面如我在前面所説，文藝事業在現代，牠的性質也不能不是定製的商品，書店老板，感於一般青年在客觀上需要些文藝知識初歩性的讀物，而投機取巧，又是人類的生來弱點，如果有捷徑可趨的話，自然是受一般人熱烈的歡迎的。别一方面呢？這些文藝家所製作的東西，在客觀上的影響，不可免地就要成爲文藝學習的障碍物了。</p>
<p>這怎麽説呢？</p>
<p>文藝是社會的東西，所以牠的第一義應該是生活的學習，從生活的實踐分開，而去向一些固定的法式去學習奉爲經典，視爲神秘，實在是往牛角尖去鑽的方法。這因爲文藝的內容，是活生生的東西，牠不能不反映着現實。相應地，現實的本身，亦是流動不居，瞬息萬變，時刻地在那裏變化發展，只有牠，却是取之無盡，用之不竭的知慧底本原，應該爲我們所向之學習的。</p>
<p>如果從事文藝的青年，當真地信賴起那些文藝家的話？視創作方法論這些東西爲萬應靈膏，終日地只在其中間尋找些圖式法則，來供作實際學習時的應用，則不但鑿柄不相入，而且愈鑽研，愈糢糊，更會不相信起自己來，這因爲那些東西，就是些一堆死板地空洞地抽象範疇，當作形式看，還很整飭可觀，如果當真地把應用起來的話，那是與文學的本質其生動的內容就發生對立底矛盾。而不幸文學的內容，又和客觀的現實相照應的，這樣就更其成爲不可踰越的難關了。</p>
<p>但既成的文藝家，如果不是定製些文學方法論之類的東西，而將其自己從各人從事於創作的經騐寫出來，做初學青年的參考。則這樣有着實際經騐的文字，雖不見得對於從事文學的青年，他們創作的前途，有着怎樣决定的影響，但作爲一些老作家的親身歷險記來讀，却是可以的。雖是這樣説，如果在文學上有所成功的青年，他還是從對於生活底艱苦的學習來的，否則就不見得有望。</p>
<h3>關心</h3>
<p>— 草明</p>
<p>冬梅嬸，是南村一向在外縣做買賣的馬洪賓底小老婆。對於她底身世，村人都不大淸楚，不過聽她底口音和看她底笨拙而對男人毫不畏羞的態度，人家就説她是廣西的「二四貨」（一種下等娼妓底稱號）因爲馬洪賓在柳州那邊開過木材店的。</p>
<p>不幸得很，馬洪賓帶她回到村來不久，他底花柳病「毒發歸心」死了。她並不完全因爲悲哀地哭了一塲之後，就跟瘦長而强悍的，每天天没亮就到桑基上摘桑的大婦吵架。兩個性格完全相反的女人整夜地吵着。喪事没有做完，那矮胖的，性子黏滯而堅靭的冬梅嬸，就跑到西村姓胡的一個破落户那兒當娘姨去了。</p>
<p>她在姓胡的那兒做了十多年活。僱主往往嫌她穿着得太不體面而氣惱，可是爲了工錢十分便宜的緣故，也就讓那身上跟乞丐差不多的，一個銅錢都不肯輕易花用的冬梅獃下去。</p>
<p>這十多年中間，因爲有承嗣的問題，使得冬梅嬸和她底大婦稍稍有點接觸；在大婦那方面完全爲了她底十幾年工錢纍積，才把隱不起孤另另的冬梅那種心理改變過來。那强悍的婦人常常用一種進攻的口氣對自己的第二兒子——冬梅嬸最喜歡那一個——煽動地説：「她喜歡你，呌她養活你好了。她底口袋現在很沉重的了。唉，枉費我把骨頭磨折了二三十年，你們才得半飽，我自己却乾枯下去；你大哥，二十多歳人還没有成親事，那個小的，倒吊起來，也滴不出一點墨水……阿渭，你好好地順着那母牛底脾氣吧，再過幾年，她把飯碗一放下，那你，你底兄弟也可以沾沾便宜……」</p>
<p>到底有那麽一天，那强悍女人底夢想好像到來了。</p>
<p>冬梅嬸因爲吃了過量的蚌肉和莧菜，馬上發作了一種古怪的急症，肚子感到中毒的急切的疼痛，在天井裏倒下來了。</p>
<p>瘦長的婦人聽了報信之後，没有思索過，就用脚不着地那樣的快歩，飛跑到胡家裏。</p>
<p>狹長的耳房裏，洋油燈非常不安地䀹着眼，幾個女人在手忙脚亂地翻着賤價的中國式的急救藥油的瓶子。格格不入的安慰和愈速的呻吟，使房間裏的空氣非常恐怖而緊張。突然，一個瘦長的影子聞進來，用蟹螯似的兩手分開圍住床沿的人們，半截身子探進帳子裏，左手有力地圍住斜躺在床上，左右翻騰着的病人底子。</p>
<p>「冬梅，冬梅，你底錢呢？你底人壽會（一種人壽保險的營業組織）簿子呢？説呀，説給我聽，錢呢？——」瘦長的女人，生怕病人馬上斷氣似地，用一種被過度的興奮激動得發抖的聲音緊逼地問，「是放給舂粉二叔麽？是借給「水斗」阿炳麽？養猪三姑那兒的月會供滿了没有，説呀——你曉得我是你頂親近的人了……」她説着不住地摇撼病人底肥短的身軀。</p>
<p>「我底天！救命要緊呀！什麽地方飛來的貓頭鷹？救回了性命，錢不會跑掉的！」一個女人用生氣的口吻，不平地高聲呌。</p>
<p>病人受着驚擾，反而似乎鎭静了一點，費力地用手打開她子上的粗糙的東西，又用手抓住胸口，夾雜着呻吟駡出來：「錢麽？你快點到算命先生那兒，算算你底時辰到了没有吧！我自己曉得，我一定有七十歳壽命，享享福才死的。你關心你自己吧，不要管我底錢——那對你不會有什麽益處的……」</p>
<p>「嗯，你氣什麽？當心自己身體呀！」誰又在説。</p>
<p>「我曉得，」病人斷斷續續地説，「你是非常心急　　一個媳婦的，你只會替那賭徒打算……阿渭呢，呌阿渭來見見我……」</p>
<p>「他，他到大池塘捉田鷄去，他還没有曉得你在生病呢，所以，你應該把所有的事情告訴我呀——」那婦人在燈光下，臉孔更顯得消瘦和蒼白，她轉了較緩慢的語氣對付病人。「以前的恩怨不提了吧，你磨折了一輩子，我捱苦了一世，爲的是什麽呢，誰來擔承我們底香火呢？無論如何，現在我是你底最新近的人了，説呀，你底錢到底放在什麽地方？……」</p>
<p>病人漸漸地疲弱下來，呻吟聲變得拖長而發顫了，女人們互相呆滯地望着别人底不安的眼色，一會又低聲地商量什麽。結果，那瘦長的女人，帶着不穩定的心情，走到事主跟前這樣提議：</p>
<p>「胡太太，我説，還是招她回家裏去妥當一些，要是她好起來，她一樣可以回來服侍你的，萬一——唉，也不致於累了你們……」</p>
<p>僱主同意了。女人們於是七手八脚地把那完全没自主力的病人舉到她底大婦底背上。……</p>
<p>但是那大婦底緊急的關心完全落了空，冬梅嬸慢慢地好起來了。她一到墟期，在市塲碰到我的時候就憤怒地談起這件事。</p>
<h3>頓河之歌</h3>
<p>— 梭羅呵夫著君涵譯</p>
<p>『我們親愛的光榮的土地不用犂耙來耕，</p>
<p>我們的土地全讓馬蹄奔騰；</p>
<p>我們親愛的光榮的土地，是拿哥薩克人頭播種；</p>
<p>我們温和的頓河多着年青的寡婦；</p>
<p>我們温和的父親頓河養有着孤童；</p>
<p>温和的頓河的波流呀，藴藏着父母們的淚珠。』</p>
<p>『哦，你，我們的父親，温和的頓河呀！</p>
<p>哦，你爲什麽，温和的頓河，流得這樣的辛苦？</p>
<p>「唉，我，温和的頓河，又怎麽不流得辛苦呢？</p>
<p>從我的深處，頓河的深處，冰冷的泉在鳴着，</p>
<p>在我，温和的頓河當中，白魚兒在跳動。」』</p>
<h3>殘廢者（四）</h3>
<p>— （Zsigmo　ndMoricz著）叔莊譯</p>
<p>忿怒地，她把頭往後傾。</p>
<p>「我，我不是生成配一個窮人做老婆的？狗疵！我的家裏人大家都是地主人家的傭人！我們苦得竟連吃也吃不出……竟説得出這樣的話！……人真是嫉妬……他們要把一個女孩配給他，一個倒處散播汚濁的女人。這個笨胚竟預備討她了……在那個時候，我想怎麽他不結我消息了，既然他第一次是那樣好的接待我的……。」</p>
<p>她暵了一口氣，迅速的接下去：</p>
<p>「我想了想，當晚，走到這裏來。您知道我丈夫是守夜的，這是他唯一能做的事情，這樣，我確定可以找着他……結果，我找到了他；他把什麽都告訴我聽！我呢，我也什麽都對他説了……他重又感到對我有許多愛情。他還要我馬上就住在他那裏……，但是我對他説這是不可能的，因爲我須對我的家裏人告别，及拏我自己的東西……於是他求我至少那一夜就住在他那裏……我就住下了……」</p>
<p>她重又把她的手指放在嘴吧上，微笑了。</p>
<p>「在那個時候，我還有着我的全副牙齒，那一夜他對我非常的熱烈。早晨，他找了一把小車子去拏我的零星雜物，及我的文件。（生日證，結婚及寡婦證等——譯者）。」</p>
<p>她帶了貞潔而謙虚的説着，她的面孔上閃耀着這麽一個快樂差不多把這暗黑的房間都照亮了。</p>
<p>「您丈夫在什麽地方？」我問。</p>
<p>「他在城裏，」她回答我。「他碰到了一件不幸事。他從梯子上跌了下來，因爲，雖然他一隻脚是木脚，他還是要帮忙搬運草乾進來。他跌斷了一個什麽東西，只得送到醫院去。他在那裏住了兩個月，接着，醫生要他走因爲醫院裏要牀用。但是自從經過手術後，他好多了。現在他已經完全痊愈。前一天，我曾去看他，同時去拏他的每月四個「朋國」的殘服者的津貼。靠了上帝	，他健好得再好没有。下星期，當小車子到城裏去時，牠同時把他載還來……」</p>
<p>一個四歳的孩子走了進來。手裏抱着一個約六個月的小孩。接着，又走來了一個。他們紅潤得像早熟的櫻桃，快活得像金色的美麗的小豬。</p>
<p>他們圍住了他們的母親，拉住了她的裙子。女人把她的圍身的角浸濕了一下，替他們一個一個揩拭面孔。</p>
<p>……我呢，在這個幸福的島中，我感到非常的羞慚。（完）</p>

<h3>當前之米糧問題</h3>
<p>— 柳塘</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>連日報載米價高貴消息，曾穿出社會局所定之限價。於是與民食有關之各方面，皆在報章發表談話，何爲而漲，何爲而難以制止，各有其立塲，各有其説法，而其結論，正與吾輩執筆爲文者，同樣無辦法。然其影響所及，可謂『徒亂人心』，不但無補於一般民食，適足爲囤户投機米商，長其氣燄，助其聲勢，更深其囤積居奇，『登壟斷而左右望』之心也，是則何苦！</p>
<p>余嘗謂空論不如行事之著明，無取多言，但觀『力行何如耳』！尤其在有職責者，更應用事實來證明。無如吾國事實，往往難於索解，去年號稱豐收，無不曰穀賤傷農，亟亟於提高穀價，以卹農艱，雖未實現，但已閙得有聲有色，正似五穀豐登，存積如山，將有紅朽之虞。曾幾何時，大旱降臨，霎時間又歉折無收，糧荒食乏之聲浪，哄動全國。禁米出口也，寓禁於征也，不許釀酤也，舉不久有『存穀將朽』之態度，一變而爲『無米爲炊』之影象，試問此去年豐收之米，是否向東洋大海中丢去也，當然無此事；然則何言論與事實之不相侔也？孟子有言，『盡信書不如無書』，吾於時賢之高論亦然。蓋放言高論，祗可由學者文人爲之；損益取舍，擇善而往，方爲有職者之責也。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>缺米，在我國本爲常事，荒年固缺，號稱有收者亦缺，否則何以年有大宗洋米之進口。至其缺乏之原因，非片言所能盡。但中國『靠天吃飯』之心理，亦爲缺糧之一大因素。農事不知改良，不明趨避，不籌防禦，而完全受天時之支配。所幸國土廣袤，幾兼寒熱温三帶氣候而有之，雨暘水旱，自難一致，故不至全國皆有秋，亦不至全國皆荒歉，如去年長江流域以豐收聞，閩省告歉；本年長江流域皆歉，而泉漳尚可；此不過舉例以言，已可見南北之收穫難齊；然亦賴有此耳，稍資調節，否則更不堪設想矣。其次則爲彼疆此界之成見太深，鄰封相視，何殊異國。遏糴在列國齊桓之世，尚知爲不可，而至今封境遏糴，仍爲故常，雖屢令禁止而無效。故我國糧食之失於調節不匀，致彼有朽米此有餓莩者亦比比然也。</p>
<p>凡遇災歉之年，米價出新而漲，亦數見不尠，近如民國十四年十七年十八年，皆有此種情形。至其所以出新而米價仍堅者，則爲上年收成不良，本年新收更歉。再則囤米者心理，見米賤則不敢囤，米貴則偏思積儲，以弋將來之大利。故去年米價大賤，欲喚起囤户儲積以維持米價而不可得；本年不待靳求，旱災未成，起而囤積者不知有多少。但本年情形，與往年有不同者在，即六月以前，全國猶在患米糧之過剩，米價之不振，而思如何維持之。不久以天旱之故，米價日高一日，馴致出新之後，米價猶是高漲。此其故何與？收成歉折，一也：農民之有收者，聽説旱災已成，非必不得已，不願出售其米，二也；産地米商見解相同，有資力者亦思染指，囤積居多，上市之籌碼益少，三也；自工商業不振，銀錢業放欵存戒懼，資力正患無可宣洩，遂藉復興農村之美名，移其一部分資財於農村，收買農産，又自儲蓄銀行法規定存欵必須以一部分投諸農村，以及江蘇農民銀行在各縣廣設農倉，收押農産。夫以銀行之資力，爲農産之收買，尤其是今年之米，爲各銀行收買農産中最良之目標，米穀既得有大力量之囤積，於是逗遛內地，不若往年之羣向滬上搬運，上海之來源稍弱，米價即可上漲，四也。若如上海最近米價之漲，則多半爲特别粳關係。米中非真有特别米也；稱特别者欲顯其爲米中之最佳者也。所謂佳者何在，亦不過爲其光滑可口，並非具有特别滋養也。特别粳産額無多；凡無多之物，易於居奇抬價，此不僅特别粳爲然，亦各物之通性也。上海既以特别粳三字爲好米之代稱，於是買米者必曰頭號特别，其實所買之米，是否爲頭號特别，買米者亦何嘗能知之。於是賣米者見人皆欲購頭號特别，遂亦從而頭號特别之，而自負有頭號特别之米者，乃動其居奇之念。上海每屆歉收之年，首起居奇抬價者，必爲所謂特别粳，特别粳一漲，餘米亦漲；餘米既漲，特别粳又漲，一漲而無所不漲，米價遂失其平準矣。此次之漲，亦猶是也。然特别粳爲少數縱口腹之欲者食之也，至大多數人，仍以頭二三號米爲多，在彼少數人，無論米價貴至三十元四十元，於其全部費用之中，猶是絶微希之數也。若在二三十元一月收入之人家，米價若自十元漲至十五元，如食指稍繁者，不將罄其半月之收入耶！故關係甚大。若認爲出新時之漲，與貴民有益；並儲蓄意居奇危害民食之行爲，而亦曲予優容，則爲虺弗摧，爲蛇將奈何！</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>目下米價上漲，固與農民爲有益，爲其多半尚在農民手中也。但從農村經濟一爲觀察，農民手中之米，難以久持，再過一月許，接近舊曆年關，恐大部分米將轉入囤户手中，其能保留者，祗爲貧農叢中之少數富農耳。及農民有大宗米上市，米價必一度回落；尤其是現在，一漲必有一批米糧出樻。因農民之心與囤户之心理稍異，囤户之心理，非至其預期之目的與時間不脱售，農民則見米價上漲，必有一部分出糶，米價乃得賴以調劑。惟自明年紅盤之後，米糧漸集中於囤户之手，設無外來之風波，米價或許長保其堅昂。蓋現在之米價，每市斛爲十三元五六角合海斛已在十六元左右，民國十八年出新時之米價亦如是，十九年之米價，在十八九元以上者，綿延至六七月之久，以彼例此，明年之米價，安知不如是。但如明年麥收良好，稻作經過亦頗順利，則米價或可稍殺其漲勢，否則非有調劑之方案，難期米價之安定。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>欲全以人爲的力量，限制米價之上升，逆天而行，自難有濟；若一切諉諸天命，非人力所能爲力，則操縱之風張，民食更不堪設想。至於防範制止之法，持論固不可過高，須合於事理，措施亦不可操切，須適乎人情。愚嘗謂統制糧食，似非現狀所能許，但政府對於糧荒時應行處置之方案不可無。方案訂立，不必求其繁密，祗在能應付歷來糧價昂貴時之環境，使民商知所戒懼，官廳既不至辦理無凖繩，亦不至濫用職權足已。此項辦法，希望早日公布，逆料一般未來所受米貴之影響，將更甚於民國十九年也。蓋今日人民之經濟，更非民國十九年可比。自有民國二十年之大水，九一八，一二八之事變，百業衰頽，民生艱窘之情狀，暴露無遺。民國十八九年一般尚深感米貴之痛苦；今明年情形既不如前，則其所感覺米價昂貴之痛苦，亦必深切於往歳也。處此種局面之下，愚以爲未來之民食問題，正內政中最重要之問題也。若仰給於洋米固可濟一時之急，而滾滾金錢，將如潮水般外溢以去，則從國民經濟着想，與一般之購用洋貨，同爲飲酖止渴之計，所以還得注重於國內糧産之調劑。然聞川米本可分濟江浙，但以捐費等項加入，反不能與洋米競，此則全爲運輸關係，中國食糧之無由彼此調節，運輸不良，亦爲其最大原因。若至米價昂貴，事先不預爲籌謀，事已成又無切實之辦法，臨渴而掘井，泉可得，民已有渴死矣。故對於未來民食問題之處理，不得不作左列之設想：</p>
<p>（一）應如何考察糧市之變遷，而定適應之方針；</p>
<p>（二）應如何調查食糧之産銷，而爲調節之張本；</p>
<p>（三）應如何廓除運輸之障礙，而圖流通之便捷；</p>
<p>（四）應如何節制食糧之進出，而收調劑之實效；</p>
<p>（五）應如何防杜居奇之發生，而爲有力之處置；</p>
<p>（六）應如何顧全一般之生計，而爲雜糧之接濟；</p>
<p>（七）應如何提倡雜糧之食用，而節米穀之消費；</p>
<p>以上所言，犖犖其大者耳，深望有職責者綢繆於未雨可也。</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>抑猶有言者，今年米穀之歉收，據稱爲三十年來所未有，似亦應在吾人注意之中。蓋日本歉收，與我國民食動生影響。民國八年日本告歉，遂向南洋産米各地大事採辦，我國亦爲之軟弛米穀出洋之禁，幾使兩粤民食，發生不安，幸其時蕪湖等處存米尚豐堪以接濟。近如民國十八年，我國因虫旱荒災歉收，日人即在南洋囤集米穀，以爲操縱地。今既與我同爲歉收，安知不與我競購外米，若然，則吾非其敵，若彼從中操縱，則吾將爲所制。雖日本去年亦告豐收，正患過剩，聞存米尚有一千六百三十八萬石，加以今年五千零七十四萬石，以及外米輸入一千三百萬石，而其消費預算不過七千一百萬石，再除去估計上過高的五百萬石，尚餘剩三百七十萬石。似不至發生絶大之影響。但國際風雲變幻無常，軍備擴張，方興未艾；食糧在戰時與軍械爲同等重要，日政府雖擁有一千一百餘萬石之存米，安知不再事補此充。何况吾人懍於已往，有民國二十年之大水，而有九一八之事變，今吾又遭逢六十年來未有之旱災，不知日人又在作何打算矣，此非故作驚人之談杞人憂也。</p>
<h3>日本生絲業之檢討</h3>
<p>— 凌文欽</p>
<p>我國製絲事業之失敗，全在墨守舊法，不知改良，迄今一蹶不振；關心絲業者遂欲取法東隣經營之方，以爲復興之計。查日本於製絲事業，近十年來，以蠶業改造之成功，土繅絲廠及雙宫絲廠之减少，及器械絲廠之代興，而得上等原料加增，下脚及次繭自然减低之良果。惟自一九三一年來，器械絲廠亦有减縮之勢，一九三三及三四年雖未有正式公佈，然私人方面調查所得减少更多，是亦不可不注意及之。今將日本近十年全國絲廠數目，調查如下</p>
<p>近十年之日本絲廠數及其車數</p>
<p>今日我國製絲家，正在模倣日人所爲，歩其後塵，但求得其精粹，未始非我製絲事業之轉機也。惟日人於學術探求，永無止境，與日俱新，試觀日本人造絲廠創立之初，多具歐美型，不數年間，已漸成本邦化矣，願我製絲界，採取日人之長，補我之短，勿永隨日人之後，專事倣效，以爲足矣；須知科學無限境，一人發明一物，以至於千人千物，方可强國裕民；幸弗以一得爲足。欲圖改造中國製絲業，勢非另起爐灶不可，蓋固有各繅絲機械，皆不合於近代工業；刻雖有少數日本化新式絲廠，設置在江浙一帶，然爲數不多。想不數年後，必有大量增加之可能。惟我人於組織之前，對於範圍大小，尤宜注意，庶人力經濟，相互調劑，方能事半功倍。日本絲廠設備，不若我國簡陋，除技術爲當然注意之事，尤着意於職工生活陶冶，是以開支浩大；處此極度不景氣時代雖工資較最高時已减去三分之二，然日常飲食，仍需供應而貨值仍無上升希望，正難乎其爲主持人矣。試讀下列器械絲廠各級統計，範圍較大者，以開支浩大，日漸减少，一九二三年在千部車以上，有九廠之多，在一九三二年已完全無存，乃大廠不易支持之明證；願我企業家知所警惕，以免將來尾大不掉，成騎虎難下之勢。日本絲廠得技術成功之惠，生産加增而經濟，每一繅絲女工能管理二十單位（即眼睛）之新車，與舊式四或五單位車相較，其相去已不可道理計矣。恐不久將來，車數日减，絲條單位自必繼續增加也。</p>
<p>（註）絲條單位即我國絲廠所謂眼睛也</p>
<p>近十年日本器械繅絲廠及車數與生産</p>
<p>蠶絲業之在日，正如我國農民之於米麥，關係非淺，是以絲廠組織，多需巨量資本，較小之廠，類多鄉村農家，自育自繅自織，專供國內之用。其專事出口，在二　三百部車之廠，資金都集有三五十萬之譜。付業家且多吸收各廠，而成一系，故得出口整齊而能巨量生産。兹將其組織情况，分類如下，足供研究。</p>
<p>（註）範圍較小之廠報告不全故總數不符</p>

<p>個渡口，這一只一年要上二次岸的破船，就是他的財産了。</p>
<p>鄉下有些事情比較都市中是好辦得多，就像老李設這個渡口，他一不是本鄉人，二也不向這裏比較有勢力的地保纒得他聽不見對河喚渡的顧客；也能够滾銅子，但是没有我們小孩子投得準，他輸了手心就獨自兒摇頭嘆氣：</p>
<p>「老了，不中用了！」</p>
<p>舉起手背擦着眼皮，又决第二次的勝負。</p>
<p>老李每天要喝幾個銅子麥燒，他是没有下酒菜的，酒瓶放在短襖的袋裏，隨時掏出來瓶口對着嘴巴喝，每喝一口酒，就那末摇摇頭，不知是他習慣，還是這麥燒喝到肚裏使他不舒適，因爲我們看見他有幾次喝了酒像小孩子似的大哭起來，但有時候也分外高興的。總之，老李對於我們小孩子的影像是很好的。</p>
<p>我十歳上縣城讀書，每年就祗有二個寒暑假碰見老李，他還是喝酒，摇渡。</p>
<p>後來的日子，我自己也不能計算了，幾年前返鄉一次，家人告訴我老李的兒子跑了。我特地到渡口去看他，他已不認識我，而且使他敬異不至，因爲本鄉就没有像我這末裝束的人物。我呌了他老李，他又舉起手背擦着眼皮，但是半天還是呆立着不知我是誰。我告訴了他我的小名，（因爲他祗知道我的小名）才打着哈哈拉我到他茅屋裏去，一邊説：「老了，不中用了！」</p>
<p>我回過頭來，茅屋門前設着一個糖攤，問他，店主人就是老李。走到裏面，這攤的規模也不見十分簡陋，門前儘是些小孩子吃的糖食，裏面貨品很多，凡火油，香烟，草紙，…鄉下人家的日用品他差不多齊備了。</p>
<p>「老李，發了財啦，做大老闆了。」我笑着對他説。</p>
<p>他摇摇頭，爲我倒了一杯茶。</p>
<p>「兒子跑了……」</p>
<p>他剛坐定，感傷的説，彷彿一篇大文字藉它來開頭似的，但被買東西的人呌他去張羅主顧了；而這段話就始終没有説出來，雖經了我的盤問。最後他竟是哭了。</p>
<p>好了，老李死了，這樣一個終其身爲生活而生活的苦老兒死了，他的棺木還是挨户募集的！</p>
<p>他那段不願説出來的話，我總想有個機會向故鄉幾個最年高的長輩去探聽出來；這當然是空頭支票，我自家兒的事都不能自己預約呢！</p>
<p>這過去的影子如今又追隨着我，好像放不下一件重大的心事般的。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>咬文嚼字</h3>
<p>— 皮</p>
<p>前日和朋友閒談，某友談及幼時在某私塾讀書，一位老先生教他孟子，讀至「周七八月夏五六月也。」老先生便説道，這周字是錯的，明明秋字之誤，因把書本上的周字，改作秋字。後來朋友講給父兄聽，没有一個不哈哈大笑。</p>
<p>我道不要笑他，現在這樣「讀書得間」，善於理解的先生，很不容易多得。七八月不是秋麽？五六月不是夏麽？這樣肯用心看書的先生，那裏容易找得到呢？</p>
<p>從前科舉時代，有一次考試，一位考先生看了題目回來，同考的先生們，問他出的是什麽題目？他説「人知之亦寧寧，（讀音）人不知亦寧寧。」弄的幾位考先生莫名其土地堂，以爲「論」「孟」已從來没有這兩句書，後來看見題目，方知這位先生識了别字，囂囂誤讀爲嚚嚚也。同考諸人，莫不大笑。後來出榜，這位識白字的先生，居然大占其魁，可見識白字也並没有什麽要緊。</p>
<p>我小時讀書，先生常駡我「不長進，」我氣憤極了，一日立志發憤讀書。就拿幾本舊有的經書，國策，史記，漢書等，爛圈爛讀，有的似乎懂得，有的簡直莫名其妙。就是所圈的書，牛頭不對馬面的，天然俯拾即是。一天我看到一段書，實在圈不下去，因此去請教一位學問很淵博的先生。</p>
<p>但是這位老先生，把這一段書看了半天，也有些疑惑不决。便大發議論道，這句書照這樣點也通，照那樣點也通，不過照這樣點是一個意義，照那樣點另是一個意義，所以你們讀書，必定要去研究考據，訓詁，箋註，之學。方能理解圓通，意義明晰。</p>
<p>我聼了這番大議論，氣得發昏章第十二，馬上把這些書本，抛在高閣，立志以後不去再看這種糊裏糊塗的書本子，認爲這種功夫，只有書獃子去幹的。所以我肚皮裏空空如也，一些没有書本，便是這個道理。</p>
<p>在民五六年時，聽見幾位有本領有墨汁的先生「提倡白話文」「打倒古書」要把孔老夫子到茅厠邊去請坐，據説這種古書的罪狀，便是涵義太多，句語蒙混，思想腐化。我聽了十分起勁，想必而今而後，可以不必費此無謂的腦筋，而造成一位書獃子的資格了，但是結果，依舊是大失所望，因爲有種白話文，雖則寫得很長很好，結果還是莫名其妙的，一點也不懂牠的意思，這類白話文，也不在少數。</p>
<p>據説因爲這個緣故，現在更進一歩了，有的主張大衆語，有的主張寫别字，有的主張拉丁化，倘然這幾種主張，果然産生出來，亦得免做書獃子的罪累。但是這幾種辦法，去實行之期，恐怕尚遠，我到有些彷徨起來，懊悔從前不聽老先生的話，法研究研究考據，箋註，訓詁，之學，到底靠得住。</p>
<h3>剪報漫談</h3>
<p>— 野菲</p>
<p>我覺得剪報是一件很有興趣而且很有意義的事情，所以我的剪報已成了習慣，習慣而變了自然；每天總要將報紙上看過的許多新聞，時評，專件，小説，小品，雜論，等統統剪下來，分貼幾部。譬如×報上的時評，就題名「×報論叢，」時事新聞，則題爲「時事剪影，」國際消息，則「國際拾聞，」社會新聞，則「社會寫真，」各地通訊，則「鄉村都市，」長篇小説，則「小説庫，」小品文字則「小品文選，」電影文字，則「銀色之海，」專件文稿，則「專文選貼。」我每天這樣剪，這樣貼，絶不覺得麻煩。</p>
<p>的確，我對於剪報是感到這樣的興趣，興趣之所以由來，自然是有很大的原因在咧！</p>
<p>如果將過去的報紙取來看，我相信比了看稗官或稗史小説還要有味，因爲小説是誰都知道造作的，而報紙却是事實的紀錄。好比取一張童年時代的自己照片來，看了非但覺得可愛，而且更會從幻想中去重温一回童年的舊夢！况且我們的記憶力也不能那麽强，將過去十年八年以前的事情都記得住。而假使我們將每年的報紙積起來，一則恐怕没有那麽多餘的地方收藏，二則就是藏了起來，等到要想看的時候又要發困難，所以將每天看過的報紙分别剪貼起來，實在是一個很好的方法。</p>
<p>在這裏面，可以看到時代的轉變，人事的變遷，社會的進化，國際的動向，及一切希奇古怪的新聞。在當時不足一看的，到現在却會怪有味兒了。真是任你比看世界名著還要有意義啦。並且還可以將過去的政治，經濟，等情形拿來和現在的做個對比，尤其是從事寫作的人，可以將它抵數十部參考書用。</p>
<p>譬如從前滿淸時代的專制，後來革命起義，及至軍閥內鬨，剝削，到了誓師北伐，奠定江南，九一八暴日侵佔瀋陽之役，民衆之熱烈運動，一二八上海之戰等等，其間一定有很多可貴的史料。要是靠腦筋記是我想凡是人類决没有這樣一個大腦袋，如果將一年一年的報紙，分别剪貼成册，那末既容易保藏，更便利翻閲，手此一册，勝讀名書萬卷，這種輕而易舉的事情，我想真值得提倡。</p>
<p>我往往看到很多人看報，祇看看副刋，或社會新聞，關於國際，政治，時評等，大部份人，都不關心的。這種閲報，他們的目的僅是取以消遣而已，誰也把看報的正義抹煞了，也有翻一翻算數的，這不是笑話嗎？而且我號稱四萬萬人口之中國，最老牌的報紙，祗銷到十多萬份，真是可憐！照我主張，我們應該要養成讀報的習慣，更應關心國際及政治消息，要知道報紙對於國家，對於民族，對於社會，對於文化教育的責任是怎樣的重大，這是我們對於報紙閲讀上不可缺少的修養。末了我還要來愼重地提倡一下剪報貼報，自然囉，能够將逐日重要記載剪貼成册，確實是一樁很有益處的事。</p>
<h3>走茅山</h3>
<p>— 詠輝</p>
<p>已是一個星期了，不但没有走到七重浮沙，而且連虎豹也没有來擋第一關：他的心是熱辣辣的。論理，他這樣的誠心的走茅山者，太上老君無論如何是會將他收爲門徒的。</p>
<p>關於茅山的傳説，他聽得很多，雖則他没有親身經歷過。——一顆一心向道的心，而且要歷盡千辛萬苦，才能見到茅山的祖師——太上老君。</p>
<p>據説第一關是有張牙舞爪的虎豹擋住去路的。這個，他已準備好了，只要心無旁念，口中念動太上老君的真言；於是，虎豹無蹤了。他向前繼續走着。</p>
<p>七里浮沙平攤在前面，是一望無垠的金黄色的沙泥。心不正時，平坦的沙地上便會幻出萬丈深淵，前面有散髮獠牙的惡魔擋住去路，後面是厲鬼緊追着；哼一個不當心，掉下萬丈深淵，被魔鬼們生吞活剝的吃了。</p>
<p>一切都不怕，他的一顆向道的心是堅强的，只等着惡魔們的到臨。遺憾的是，至今没有碰到惡魔們擋住他的去路！他心目中的茅山，還在虚無之鄉呢。</p>
<p>烟絲在指示着他的去路——上茅山的去路（？）（註——相傳走茅山者手中必定托着一個香盤，人的行向，以烟絲被風所吹，飄去的方向爲定。）</p>
<p>「也許要走六六三十六天吧」？他這樣的想着。三十六天的時間是很攸長的呢；他身上的炒米，僅够吃兩天，再過些日子可要餓死了。</p>
<p>虎豹，惡魔，都可以用一顆向道的心擊退（？），但是没有了炒米吃時，却不能拿着一顆向道的心充飢呢。</p>
<p>他開始有些不安起來了！這不安剛竄上他的心頭，他即刻又用力的壓下去，——起了退縮的心是要被老君責罰，而呌厲鬼殺死的呢。</p>
<p>兩天，很快，也可以説是很漫的過去了！最後的一撮炒米是怪香的呢。這次可真有些不安起來了——炒米已完哩</p>
<p>接連又是幾天過去了，肚皮可真有些那個了。</p>
<p>夜的山上是怪静穆的，静穆得聽得真忐忑之心的顫動哩！——是那樣急促的跳躍着的心啊！</p>
<p>唾液線一酸，黄水往上一湧，「哇」的一口吐了出來；胃差不多被磨擦得發炎了。</p>
<p>隱身法，土遁，騰雲駕霧的慾望慢慢地退走了，接踵而來展開在腦中的：是一幅現實的凄慘之圖畫啊。</p>
<p>用一個麻袋背着六升炒米——家中僅存六升米啊！帶了一身換洗衣服，手中拿定一個香盤，固執地離别了他的家，——上茅山學道去哩！</p>
<p>眼淚是一粒緊接着一粒連成一串的掉着，妻在飲泣呢。兒子拉住了他的手爸爸爸爸的呌着，哭着，跳着。但他的心是鐵一般的堅，——學道的人還能爲凡情而留戀麽？</p>
<p>現在可有些異樣了，心也不那麽堅强了，——大概是飢餓驅逐了太上老君吧？倒有些反悔不該走到這四顧茫茫的深山中來。回去麽？脚可有些不對勁！</p>
<p>太陽在東方的樹梢頭咬破了薄薄的一層雲翳，大地又開始活躍了；他的腦筋更淸明了一點：</p>
<p>「東家没有來逼欠租吧」？</p>
<p>「僅有的六升米被我拿走了以後，他們吃些什麽呢」？</p>
<p>「回去吧」！他用力掙扎着，身子還没有坐起，「哇」的又吐了幾口黄水，酸溜溜的。</p>
<p>眼睛慢慢地失掉了光彩，耳朶裏嗡嗡的呌着，一顆微顫之心也快休息了！——「茅山呢」？他睜開了最後一次眼睛</p>
<h3>北風凜烈之夜</h3>
<p>— 亦菴</p>
<h3>沉溺與享受</h3>
<p>— 甲辰</p>
<p>人實在並非鐵筋銅骨那麽牢固，像機械物體似的日以繼夜的勞作無休止，而推不平磨不蝕的。因此，無論誰，在他的生活行進上應該是具有兩面性，工作和娱樂。每天完畢份內所應做的事務之後，必要地有一個時間以休憇，這休憇的本身便是一種解放，一種精神上疲勞的解放，也便是恢復固有的氣力的蘇息。因此娱樂之存在於人之間亦猶乎工作是一樣的重要不能缺少。即是説，人必須工作，也必須娱樂，娱樂的真諦就是在於享受，換了句話講：即是人既有工作的勞碌自然也要有娱樂的享受。正當的娱樂是任何人都得有享受的權利。但是人大抵是賦有共同的惰性的本能，如物理學上的惰性作用一般，不推不動，讓它停下來它便永遠的停着了。人復如此，更有一點，畏懼勞碌而耽於閙逸舒適，往往會因爲娱樂便撇掉正經的工作。把所有的時間完全消費在娱樂之上，再談不到什麽工作不工作，到了如此的田地，娱樂已不能算是享受，而是變成一種沉溺的行爲了，所以在一定的塲合上，娱樂的亨受是非有適可的約制的限度不可。倘若超過了適可的限度以上，便是一種沉溺的表現，一沉溺，不特亨受的真意味馬上喪失，而且成爲墮落的了。</p>
<p>世間一切的事一切的物，統没有絶對的，必然性，所謂善不一定就善，所謂惡不一定就惡，善之中未始不無包含惡的成份，惡之中，也未始不無包含善的成份。娱樂這回事也莫不同具此種道理。</p>
<p>所以娱樂的真意味，不管是屬於那一方面。是僅有能真切去享受的人方得領略。而在另一般人——沉溺與享受没有分開。娱樂的享受的真意味根本便無從感覺到，反且作成有害無益的東西了。可是事實上，能真真了解享受是享受，沉溺是沉溺，而能始終只止於享受不至於沉溺的人可不容易有。相反因於不瞭解享受而常由享受不知不覺陷落沉溺中的却多得很。這里没有别的，頂大的理由是緣於人原本就有種種不良的貪圖安樂的劣根性。而一般地説來，養息在特殊的優渥的生活圈子裏面，沉溺於不是享受的娱樂當中的人同時格外多見。爲了什麽呢，爲了時間本過有閑，可做的事又本少，——這一個人完全成了只有爲物質慾的逐追的感官享樂，再無精神上的蘇息的享受了。反轉來説，忙的時候多，閑的時候少，就會自然地愈加珍重娱樂之享受，感覺享受之可貴，而認真使着小心使用着。因此可以這樣説了，生活越廹忙的人，就越覺出享受娱樂的價值。生活越空閑的則越無真正享受可受，爲其精神的重壓的要求需要享受以解放，已經早就沉溺還談什麽享受。於是墮落者也算此種種最多了。</p>
<h3>老李</h3>
<p>— 阿蘋</p>
<p>這個孤獨的苦老兒，老李，幾年來我腦海裏已没有他一些兒影子存在了。昨天鄉下出來一位朋友，談及老李死了；在這年頭兒死了一個老李自然是無足輕重的事，不過死後二天才由地保挨户募錢，買棺成殮，説起來似乎是太悽慘了。</p>
<p>老李是孤獨的，他没有老伴，有一個叫義上的兒子帮着他在三义河口渡口這一只一年要上二次岸的破船，就是他的財産了，</p>
<p>鄉下有些事情比較都市中是好辦得多，就像老李設這個渡口，他一不是本鄉人。二也不向這裏比較有勢力的地保打招呼，他就在地利人和的優勢上生活下來。本鄉人能够道出他的來歷的，現在恐怕没有一二個人了。</p>
<p>本來在離此二里之遥，有石橋可以通到市集去的，自從老李設了這個渡口，誰多願意少跑些路，出一枚銅元一次的擺渡錢，還感激老李給與他們不少便利呢。</p>
<p>漸漸地他同本鄉人混熟了，因爲省吃儉用多幾個錢，他就在渡口搭一個茅屋，父子他倆把船艙中的舖蓋搬起來就算有了個家。</p>
<p>這時候我大約是六七歳吧，每天跑到渡口去，老李雖然已有四十歳光景，他却喜歡同我們玩，所以渡口的小孩子愈聚愈多。他空着時候講山海經，往往</p>

<h3>跳舞是做電影明星的終南捷徑（下）</h3>
<p>— 選青</p>
<p>堅忍耐勞是爲成功要素</p>
<p>舉一反三小道可以喻大</p>
<p>「馬克西貝爾所説的道理是：譬如你開汽車，你不是一下子就開足馬力的。那是辦不到的。你一定當慢慢地開頭檔，走了幾歩，再開二檔，再走幾歩，然後開三檔，以後就平穩迅速暢行無阻了。你開你自己身體的馬達的時候，亦要這樣才好。一早晨起來，先在户外散散歩，或在户內亦可。起先慢慢的，然後漸漸增加速率，直等到快歩，然後再慢慢遲緩下來，直到普通的散歩一樣。那樣，你就不至於喘息，而你的身體的機械，亦就可以行駛得很平穩了。」</p>
<p>「然後你要知道怎樣恢復你的體力的方法——在一個極短促的時候。拳術家祗要一分鐘，就可以恢復體力的。你不可不學，如同你學别的東西一樣。坐着，將頭向後靠，閉目，伸足，兩手鬆弛了垂在身旁。强廹你自己，這樣五分鐘之久，從腦筋裏驅除你的一切思慮。你天天如此，日日行之，以後就可以知道静坐，弛放，就是迅速恢復體力的惟一方法了。我想將來總有一天，跳舞家會採用拳術家的方法來操練他們自己的。這種方法，於跳舞家的面容，比於他們的跳舞，關係更大。在銀幕上的歌舞，我們必須有美貌的女子，但是，或者你不會相信的，今年選擇舞女，或者明年就毫無用塲了。理由？身體，面容，一切，一年之中的變遷是很大的。那亦是很難防止的，除非舞女們，亦像拳術家一樣，天天不斷的練習，那當然是很不中聽的話，但是，那確是必需的，尤其是在電影界裏，因爲在舞台上，女子面上多一兩條線紋，是不大要緊的，但是在鐘頭前面多一兩條線紋，就成了自殺了。」</p>
<p>「還有一句話，好像是一個惡消息，但是我向來不欺騙人的。女子們被選進歌舞劇的年限，我們普通定爲二十一歳。但是這個年限在許多地方，是於一般舞女很有帮助的，因爲許多愛好的舞女，知道她們的年限將到，就竭力設法引起人家對於她們表演藝術的進展，而不在跳舞一件事上了。但這並不是説，你一過了二十歳，就可以不用學習跳舞了。我説的是，如果你要以跳舞爲職業的，你一定要開始得早些，但是許多明星，是拿跳舞來輔助他們天才的發展的。他們當然有許多已經得到了跳舞的帮助。琴吉爾羅吉士初登舞台的時候，是一個跳舞家。等到她進了電影界，她是一個喜劇家，一直没有跳過舞，直等到她替弗勒德亞士泰爾拍了一張歌舞台。弗勒德覺得她是世界上最易教的女子，因爲她天性知道音律和節奏。現在她成了弗勒德亞士泰爾的對角了。其餘的明星，二十多歳以後，或者成名之後，忽然發現了他們自己的舞蹈天才，而更加帮助了他們進展的，亦更僕難數。最末，跳舞亦和别的事一樣，從堅忍耐勞裏，才可以獲得成功。如果你能於跳舞這區區小道之中，學到以上所説的一切，再加以舉一反三之功，那就可以説一句：『天下大事，不足爲也』了。」（完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「英京寃獄」</h3>
<p>— 石斧</p>
<p>Charlie　Chan　in　London</p>
<p>—大上海映—</p>
<p>「寃獄」這一類字樣用在影片名上，確實很新頴，這片名的原意是説「陳查禮在倫敦，」也和「霧夜飛屍案」的原意説「特魯蒙的歸來」有同樣的類似。大約這也是偵探片題名的不易。</p>
<p>這次是説陳查禮因事到倫敦，恰巧遇到一件寃枉的案子，他便擔任偵查，始終平反了這寃獄。</p>
<p>在故事起頭叙述葛雷因嫌疑入獄，齊巧這時候陳查禮就來到，好像是笨一點，但因此可以留出許多「戲的演出」的機會，也未嘗不是經濟的。</p>
<p>不用説的偵探片是千篇一律的用「故佈疑陣」的章法和「聲東擊西」的手段以求得結果的突兀，所以除管家飛利浦（後來發現他也是偵探）之外，如葛登好華德都是一副「尶面孔」甚至於馬夫也透露着「殺人的兇犯」樣子，而真兇李西夢倒「滿面春風」的令人深信不疑。</p>
<p>華納夏能的陳查禮是有着如三麻子的活關公的資格一般，他所表演的華人處處是「迂緩」「陰險」和「陋劣。」要是没有原著説明查禮的個性，是「沉摯」「精細」和「有哲理思想」，那必定要被這位華然們先生的一雙鈍眼更要形容得中國人不成一個東西了。</p>
<p>查禮接案之初，拾到了珀茱拉的一個鑽戒，留到結尾再還她，説：「這纔是完全的結案」是很好的一個章法。依克萊夫的三道頭包打聽時時用筆錄查禮所説的要點，後來連揶揄他的話都要寫上去，可發一噱。此公在「霧夜飛屍案」中飾一廵捕，就可看出他是一個偵探片中不可少的配角了。</p>
<p>在陳查禮的片中是永遠這麽一個作風：不會使你看了「拍案稱奇」也不會教你看了「没精打彩」。不過像華納夏能的作品，總是少來些爲妙！他在美國人的心理上，恐怕Misleading的地方很多吧。</p>
<h3>評「法力無邊」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>Defense　Rests—國泰</p>
<p>有許多舊觀念的電影作家，他們若干程度的看到了社會的黑幕，而自己對於這些黑幕也表示非常不滿。但是他們却不能進一歩的從經濟上去探討，所以有如此黑幕的社會根據，因此他們便没有方法分析，更不理解從經濟制度的變革以求澈底的解决。結果，他們便將這些罪過加担在某些人羣身上，而在藝術作品上又映出作者的道德觀念，而良心的去責罰他們所要責罰的人，或者是使那些罪惡者流，洗心革面改過行善。自然，我們認爲這種觀念是不正確的，雖然他們也講藝術的良心。</p>
<p>關於這一觀念的影片，確是很多，現在我們又看到這「法力無邊」了。這一影片，劇作者似乎對於法律有一估價，他從律師口裏説出，使罪犯受罪，是法律的任務，而律師的任務是使被告脱罪的。於是那律師恃其雄才巧辯，使那嫌疑殺人犯藉口「正當防衛」而脱罪，因此真正的殺人犯却逍遥法外了。此外，這一律師還爲一綁票匪辯護，因而被綁的家族（一個老婦）憤而自殺於律師之辦公室裏。後者使律師感受極重的良心責罰，再加上受人的勸誘，立刻改過自新，和惡徒們斷絶來往。在這裏，劇作者對於法律之被罪犯作爲一種玩具，表示了不滿，可是他的解决方法，却祇有良心的去勸誘那種不法的律師。至於法律本身，自然不會給與絲毫指斥，這由於惡徒的到底服法，便有着明顯的説明。</p>
<p>像這樣的故事，我們不能不認爲那是很戲劇性的，可是在導演不靈活的手法之下，却使我們感覺極大的沉悶。那末些對話，再加女主角的演技又太不高明，在技術上的没有成功，那是無可諱言的了。</p>

<h3>黑面慈心（Imitation　of　Life）（八）</h3>
<p>— 文印</p>
<p>正當蒂里拉和裴尋找披歐拉的幾天，史提芬天天陪著吉茜出去玩。他們每天晚上到一個新地方去。他本來是個魚類學家，他將他所有的各式各樣的魚類，都詳詳細細地講給她聽了。不久也們二人就成了很好的朋友。但是好事多磨，他們的友誼却給吉茜弄糟了，原來吉茜對於史提芬，竟發生了愛情了。當裴回家的那天下午，吉茜就告訴了他。那時史提芬正要離開自己的庽所去看裴，吉茜忽然來了。她那一半孩子，一半成人的眼睛，看着史提芬的臉説道：「史提芬，我愛你。」史提芬一些没有準備，聽了吉茜的話，不覺嚇了一跳。他説：「吉茜……我的親愛的。」吉茜道：真的。我愛你。她誠懇的聲音，表明她的話是從心裏出來的。史提芬不覺説道：「你不應當拿你的長輩開玩笑。我知道你們女學生們的脾氣的。剛才差不多你將我虎住了。」吉茜説道：「我本來想和你到各種地方去玩去……，那時我生平最快樂的時候……不過那都是一個空想……你拿我當作一個小孩子……哦，史提芬……你吻我……」她拿顫動著的小嘴唇凑了上去，但是史提芬没有吻她的嘴唇，祗用手理著她的頭髮，慢慢説道：「吉茜，你還没有懂得你説的是什麽話。你還没有懂得愛情是什麽。」吉茜聽了，瘋狂似的將吉茜推開了，大聲嚷道：「哦，我不懂得嗎？」她訽着，就哭起來，並且從屋子裏逃走了。</p>
<p>到了晚上，正在晚飯之先，裴於談話之時，提到了他們婚姻的計劃。史提芬站着一言不發，心裏暗暗替吉茜難過。吉茜聽了她母親的話，心中如受刀刺一樣的痛，眼淚不覺湧了起來。裴看見了，就將她的女兒摟了過來問道：「寳貝，怎麽啦？」吉茜摇摇頭，就奔上樓去了。裴跟了上去。吉茜後來忍住了自己的傷心，亦没有將她的秘密告訴她的母親，從新下樓去向史提芬道賀，但是她的頭垂在胸前，一時抬都抬不起來。那天晚上，他們就商量着到一個時髦的地方去吃晚飯，慶祝他們的訂婚。但是正在他們要出去的時候，一個女僕奔了進來説道：「裴小姐……你快來……不好了……蒂里拉……我看見她躺在地下。」裴聽了，立即奔到蒂里拉時房裏，走到她的床邊。蒂里拉看見了裴就説道：「裴小姐，我不想㳳了。」斐説道：「不要緊的。我在這裏陪着你。蒂里拉……你要什麽，你告訴我……」蒂里拉道：「小姐，謝謝你。我要你，好好的葬我……我要一副軍樂隊，送我去見上帝去……」……等到一切事情過去了，裴得了工夫，重新想到自己的生活，和史提芬的生活的時候，她忽然覺悟到吉茜已經變易了。那個念頭，像電一樣，直通到她的心裏。吉茜和史提芬發生了情愛了！她起初覺了一個極大的刺激，但得到後來，她漸漸覺悟到她和史提芬的婚姻，是永遠不會圓滿成功的了。並且看着蒂里拉的樣子，深知她自己倘使和史提芬結了婚，她們母女之間，一定不會像從前那樣相依如命和洽無間的了。她自己告訴自己，那是决不可如此的，無論如何，她不肯爲了自己的幸福，而犧牲吉茜的任何一小部份的……她自己的生命，是建築在吉茜的四週，爲了吉茜，她已經工作了，努力了，犧牲了半生。她於是婉轉曲折地和史提芬説了。雖然吉茜懇求着她嫁給史提芬，她已定打定了主意，一些不爲摇動。她説：「吉茜，我的寳貝。你比什麽都要緊。你的快樂，加番手一切之上。你和我一同到外國去遊歷去吧。」（完）</p>

<h3>National League Committee Formal Meeting on China's Six-Year Opium Prohibition Plan</h3>
<p>Opium to be Prohibited Step-by-Step Within a Set Time Limit</p>
<p>International Attention and Sympathy</p>
<p>[Geneva] The Opium Advisory Committee held a formal meeting today to discuss the Chinese government's six-year opium prohibition plan. Representatives from various countries spoke, noting the significant responsibility borne by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. They expressed hope that the Chinese government could compile annual reports for review. These reports, prepared by either the Opium Prohibition Committee or a new body, should detail the total amount of opium sold annually in ten provinces and the total number of smokers. This would allow the committee to track the cumulative progress of the annual prohibition efforts, record the average amount of opium consumed by registered smokers, the total tax revenue, and the proportion of this revenue used for opium prohibition measures. The international community views this as a test of the Chinese government's strength and sincerity. The League of Nations and various countries will closely monitor the development of the opium prohibition situation in China after the implementation of the new prohibition plan. (Central News Agency dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>[Geneva] The Opium Advisory Committee today discussed China's new opium prohibition policy. Chinese representative Hu Shih-tse delivered a speech, stating that he was deeply grateful for the congratulations from representatives of various countries to the Chinese government, Chairman Chiang, and himself, and especially cautious regarding the guidance and criticisms offered. Subsequently, Chinese opium statistics will be compiled by the Opium Prohibition Supervisory Committee and then forwarded to the League of Nations by the Opium Prohibition Committee. However, it should be stated that the Chinese government's new plan is pioneering a new path in the fight against drugs, not establishing a monopoly. It aims to completely prohibit the production and consumption of opium step-by-step within six years. The government's promulgation of these new regulations is not to please foreign governments but to rescue its own people. On one hand, it is blocking the tiger at the front door, completely eliminating drugs; on the other hand, it is blocking the wolf at the back door, preventing a monopoly from materializing. There is no doubt about the government's sincerity in implementing this new plan. In the sixth year of the Republic of China (1917), China had largely prohibited opium, and it is still possible now. At that time, both Britain and India were willing to cooperate with the Chinese government to prohibit the transportation of drugs to China, for which the Chinese government is deeply grateful. The Polish representative expressed concern that the opium tax revenue could be a dangerous temptation. Recalling that China previously abolished likin taxes, this concern is unfounded. If the Chinese government and people are determined to prohibit opium, there will be no problem. The Siamese representative stated that the export of Chinese private opium made it difficult for Siam to prohibit drugs. Hu replied that he expected this to improve after the implementation of the new plan. In fact, the Siamese government's monopoly policy has nothing to do with private opium, and Chinese opium has not been able to enter Siam. The Siamese representative could not confirm when their government's monopoly system would be abolished. The U.S. representative stated that the U.S. government was currently studying the new plan and would pay attention to its implementation and results. Hu replied that the Chinese government hoped that various countries could provide China with strong cooperation, as the Chinese government, although determined, still faces many difficulties. The general opinion of the committee was that the Chinese government has taken on an extremely arduous task, and they expressed sincere sympathy and attention. If the plan succeeds, China's international standing will increase significantly; if the plan fails, China's credibility will undoubtedly suffer greatly. After the committee adjourned, reporters visited Hu. Hu replied that today was the anniversary of his late father's death, and he was deeply honored to continue his father's aspirations and work for China. (Central News Agency dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>[Geneva] According to the new anti-drug regulations submitted by China to the League of Nations, those who sell opium and narcotics in China will mostly be subject to the death penalty, as will those who inject morphine needles into people for reasons other than medical treatment. It is also stipulated that smoking licenses will no longer be issued after six years, and the elderly and those with severe addictions will be allowed to smoke, but they must purchase opium with a license.

Although the names of partnerships and unlimited companies are different, their unlimited liability is the same. Therefore, whether the shareholders of unlimited companies and the directors of limited companies, who also serve as partners with unlimited liability, are subject to the restrictions of Article 28 and Article 145, Paragraph 2 of the Company Law is unclear. The Judicial Yuan was consulted for interpretation. The Yuan interpreted that Article 28, Paragraph 1 of the Company Law only refers to shareholders with unlimited liability of the company, so partnership shareholders are not subject to the restrictions.

<h3>Observations on the German Political Situation</h3>
<p>— (Qiu)</p>
<p>Yesterday, Havas London reported that an unstable state seems to be lurking within Germany. At this time of extreme tension in Europe, suddenly hearing this news seems abrupt. However, verified by the Reuters report of the 19th of this month, stating that the German authorities have ordered that the Nazi Party and similar organizations may not hold meetings without approval, it is possible that a change is brewing in the German political situation.</p>
<p>According to our superficial observations, since Hitler came to power in Germany, the time has not been long, but his position and prestige seem to be increasing daily. After the coup of June 30th of this year, although his created stormtroopers suffered many killings, the current strength of the team still has 2.8 million people. Together with the existing regular army, national defense army, gendarmerie, etc., the total German military strength is no less than 5.5 million. In addition, there are 4,000 trained air force pilots. Although this is propaganda by the enemy of the Germans, based on their years of actively preparing for military preparations, this number should not be far from the truth. Therefore, when European neighbors hear of German actions, they are all shocked, believing that Hitler's actions are enough to affect the peace of the European situation. Looking at recent facts, however, Hitler has always adopted a calm attitude when rumors are rampant. In addition to promoting the desire for peace, he never reveals anything. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>We often feel that Hitler's response to the current European situation is mainly aimed at France and Italy. When the Vienna "July 25th" incident occurred, Italy suddenly rose up, and he immediately changed his policy. First, he recalled his ambassador to Austria, and then he replaced the leader of activities against Austria. The Saar issue became tense again last month. France threatened to send troops to occupy it. Hitler then ordered Borker to issue a statement stating that the activities of the National Socialist Party would be suspended for one month after January 10th of next year. Most recently, France stated that Germany is a fundamental element threatening European peace, and Italy also encouraged Austria to participate in the demand for military equality, and even went a step further to conclude an Italian-Austrian military agreement to control the throat of the Danube. Hitler also regarded all of this as nothing, and never made a frontal confrontation. Speculating on the reason, it is likely that Hitler still believes that the foundation of his political power has not yet been consolidated.</p>
<p>In ancient and modern times, ambitious people who want to do things abroad must first examine their strength. If the strength is sufficient, then they can advance and retreat freely. Today, Germany is really in a difficult autumn both internally and externally. Taking the economy as an example, it cannot restore the past situation of British and American international capital assistance, and has suffered further competition from France and Italy. What the people of the country look up to Hitler for are all the promises he made in the past. However, due to the increasing external international resistance, it has turned to affect the stability of its internal economic circles. The current foreign telegrams reported that the phenomenon of political turmoil in Germany is bound to erupt, and it must not be a fictitious talk. Although we cannot say that the root cause of the political instability in Germany lies entirely in the rigidity of the diplomatic situation, Hitler will only have to shift the people's attention and unanimously confront the outside world in order to overcome its inherent crisis. This can be obtained from historical precedents. What is worrying is that the current French center has the radical socialist party as the center of its political power, and the French people have a strong expression of rigidity toward Germany. Under Mussolini's rule in Italy, the foundation of political power is also unusually consolidated and impeccable. As for the internal strife in Austria, Hitler cannot use it. It can be seen that there are no opportunities for Hitler to take advantage of in the international community. Hitler himself knows that he must wait for an opportunity to shift the people's attention and not act rashly, and he must start with rectifying the internal affairs. This is Hitler's ability.</p>
<h3>American Silver Party Split</h3>
<p>[Manila] Observers have discovered a definite rift among Silver Party members. Senators Thomas, Wheeler, and McCarran seem unable to agree on proposals for currency inflation. All three believe there is a need to expand credit and currency under government control, but their methods differ. Wheeler advocates free coinage of silver but opposes the gold-silver ratio of sixteen to one. McCarran wants the government to issue currency to redeem existing tax-exempt government securities. Thomas opposes both of these plans. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Elections</h3>
<p>[Moscow] About 10,000 village soviets in the Russian Republic, Ukraine, Belarus, Transcaucasia, and Turkmenistan have been re-elected, accounting for approximately 15.5% of the total number of village soviets in the Soviet Union. 80% of voters in these areas participated in the elections, compared to only 70% in 1931. Over 200,000 Soviet committee members have been elected, of which 24% are women (compared to only 21% in the previous election) and 76% are collective farmers (compared to 33% in 1931). During the elections, a large number of individual farmers joined collective farms. In the Moscow province, nearly 11,000 people recently joined collective farms. Urban elections are also progressing actively, with the vast majority of voters participating. Voters in Gorky City unanimously elected the famous writer Gorky as a Soviet committee member.

<h3>Coal Mine Flood in Matsushima Drowns Fifty-Three Miners</h3>
<p>Fukuoka. At around 6:00 AM on the 25th, a flood suddenly erupted from the fourth district pit entrance of the Matsushima Coal Mine in Nagasaki Prefecture. Fifty-three miners who were working were unable to escape and were swept into the turbulent whirlpool, their whereabouts unknown. The coal mine authorities, due to this sudden and tragic incident, immediately implemented an emergency assembly and made every effort to rescue them, but the water was raging, resulting in ineffective rescue efforts. It is feared that all of the miners have been submerged. (Nichi-Ren dispatch, 25th)</p>

<h3>League of Nations Continues Mediation in the Chaco War</h3>
<p>Report Still Awaiting Acceptance</p>
<p>[Geneva] After the League of Nations Special Assembly passed the Chaco Valley report, many national representatives rose and spoke. The French representative, Massigli, gave a long speech, stating that the Chaco Valley dispute resolution method could not be applied to Europe in the future because the borders of Paraguay and Bolivia had not yet been clearly defined by treaty. The Assembly then appointed a committee as stipulated in the report, which included representatives from major powers as well as representatives from Spain, Portugal, and South American countries. The committee will continue to monitor the development of the Chaco Valley issue, awaiting to see if Paraguay and Bolivia accept and comply with the League of Nations report on December 20th, and will simultaneously send telegrams to the two countries urging them to cease hostilities. The Six-Nation American Committee must participate in the ceasefire ceremonies of the two countries and begin work after the League of Nations report is accepted. The committee includes representatives from Peru, Chile, and Argentina. Representatives from the United States and Brazil will participate in the negotiations when necessary.

<h3>Incidents Rekindle on the Chinese Eastern Railway</h3>
<p>Khabarovsk. The Japanese army continues its transgressions along the Chinese Eastern Railway line, especially in the eastern section. New facts of this kind have been reported from Harbin. On the 22nd of this month, while hanging telephone lines along the Eastern Railway in Harbin, the Japanese army set fire to a railway grass warehouse at the Meteveychi station. It was extinguished by personnel on an attached train. The next day, the grass warehouse caught fire again and was burned to ashes. A railway worker witnessed them setting the fire and was arrested and severely beaten. The next day, another grass warehouse also caught fire. A railway guard tried to step forward to put it out but was stopped by Japanese soldiers and was also severely beaten. (TASS dispatch, 24th)</p>

<p>[Tokyo] The Ministry of Finance calculated the reserve fund for the Manchurian Incident expenses in the ninth fiscal year budget as 10 million yen. It discussed with the Ministry of the Army whether the same should be approved for the tenth fiscal year. As a result, it was formally decided at the Cabinet meeting on the 24th that 5 million yen should still be the first reserve fund for the tenth fiscal year. (Nichi-Ren dispatch, 25th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Aggression Leads to Stalemate in Naval Talks</h3>
<p>Otherwise, Equal Demands Could Be Accommodated</p>
<p>Nichi-Den Relays Content of Anglo-American Cooperation</p>
<p>[Washington] Responsible parties here declared today that Japan's aggressive actions in China over the past three years are the main reason for the breakdown of the London Naval Conference. They also believe that the current negotiations cannot yield any concrete results. However, they also stated clearly that if there were no record of Japan's aggression against China and its commercial monopoly in "Manchukuo", the United Kingdom and the United States might be able to grant some concessions to Japan's demands for naval equality. A spokesman for these powerful parties cited the rights granted to Japan at the previous Washington and London conferences as evidence, such as the fact that Japan had at least gradually achieved its goal of equality in principle when the 1930 London Conference closed. If Japan had not engaged in the facts of occupying Manchuria, coveting Inner Mongolia, and claiming hegemony over China, etc., Japan could have easily obtained naval equality next year. All of these actions have caused the United Kingdom and the United States to no longer trust Japan, and the oil monopoly in particular is regarded here as closing the door to "Manchukuo" to facilitate Japan's other monopolistic ventures.

<p>[London] The Japanese government's decision to unilaterally announce the abrogation of the Washington Naval Treaty is now considered unavoidable. According to reliable sources, the United States plans to propose an Anglo-American mutual assistance plan to the United Kingdom to prevent a naval arms race when Japan actually announces the abrogation of the treaty, and to establish an informal agreement. The content is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>1.  In order to prevent a naval arms race, the United Kingdom and the United States should provide each other with detailed information on their respective shipbuilding plans. 2. The United Kingdom and the United States will each use their own fleets to supplement the deficiencies of the other's fleet, implementing this passive measure. (Nichi-Ren News Agency dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>[London] The US-Japan political meeting will be held tomorrow. The US side may, based on the consultations of the UK-US meeting, listen to the reasons for the Japanese request for equal rights, and then inquire about the true intentions of the Japanese side on political issues such as the background of arms reduction issues, the Far East, and the Pacific. It can promote the opportunity for preliminary talks to turn to political issues. Therefore, tomorrow's US-Japan political and legal meeting is quite noteworthy. (Dentsu dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>British and American Opinions Align</h3>
<p>Representatives from Both Countries Go to the Countryside to Play Golf</p>
<p>[London] The chief representative of the US naval negotiations, Davis, and the Chief of Naval Operations, Standley, went to the countryside today with British Foreign Secretary Simon to play golf, taking the opportunity to re-engage on naval issues. According to the impression of the American people, the United Kingdom and the United States have completely agreed on the procedure for the naval negotiations in the near future, and believe that in addition to political aspects, they will also involve the technical aspects of naval issues. According to the impression of the American people, the United Kingdom and the United States have completely agreed on the procedure for the naval negotiations in the near future, and believe that in addition to political aspects, they will also involve the technical aspects of naval issues. When this negotiation began, the Japanese representative formally declared that Japan would not be willing to discuss the details until the British and American representatives accepted the principle of naval equality. However, up to now, Japan's attitude has obviously changed. The Japanese chief representative, Yamamoto, personally declared that, regarding technical aspects, he would at least be prepared to offer hints or opinions if he did not make a formal proposal. Although this expression of Japan's cannot be regarded as a softening of attitude, well-informed sources generally hope that the Japanese representative's statement on technical aspects can be relied upon to identify the basis for agreement on the main points. In short, the purpose of the current negotiations is not to draft a treaty, but only to seek the convenience of drafting a treaty. Therefore, people around the American delegation said, "The journey from the present to the final goal is still far away." (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Japan Will Submit Concrete Proposal</h3>
<p>But Still Needs to Observe the Situation</p>
<p>[London] Representative Yamamoto's statement to British journalists on the 23rd regarding the trial plan for a UK-Japan compromise has attracted much attention, believing that the Japanese side is about to propose any new compromise plan. However, the Japanese side intends to focus on explaining the fundamental principles, so it will then take the lead in proposing concrete proposals to realize the principles, in the hope that this side can re-launch from scratch. Because this trial plan will gradually involve the possibilities of tonnage, years, and other figures, all parties are extremely concerned. However, whether this proposal can become a reality is still intended to observe the future situation. Whether it will be proposed is not convenient to decide at present.

<h3>Japan Purchases Airship from Germany</h3>
<p>Germany Declares No Political Implications</p>
<p>[Berlin] Since the news that Japan would order the Zeppelin airship has been widely reported, the company here issued a statement saying that negotiations on this matter have not yet concluded, and the rumored political issues are all false. This matter is entirely a commercial transaction of bartering goods for goods. German merchants have this kind of transaction with all countries, and will continue to implement it in the future.

<h3>Twelve US Navy Aircraft Plan to Make a Global Flight</h3>
<p>Plan Still Under Consideration</p>
<p>American San Diego. Senior naval officers are currently carefully considering a plan for twelve giant seaplanes to fly around the world. The aircraft have been ordered by the Navy Department from a manufacturer in Buffalo, New York. Admiral Johnson is quite enthusiastic about this plan. He is eager to demonstrate the 3,000-mile flight capability of the giant aircraft. However, this plan is still undecided because the route has not yet been selected and it is not certain whether the Secretary of the Navy will approve it. (National dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Britain Develops Air Routes</h3>
<p>[London] Britain plans to greatly expand its imperial air routes early next year. The Air Ministry, the Post Office, and government-subsidized airlines are planning to greatly reduce the travel time from London to major cities in the empire, vigorously develop airmail with various territories, and increase routes to South Africa. Routes directly to China are also being considered. The government will announce this plan soon. Most of it is the result of the London to Melbourne air race. In the race, American and Dutch aircraft and the British-made Comet competed for the championship. The Dutch aircraft flew 12,600 miles in three days, sixteen hours, and eighteen minutes, averaging about 156 miles per hour. The aircraft is an ordinary commercial aircraft, carrying four passengers and mail. British aviation experts are paying close attention to this. The Dutch Royal Airlines has ordered ten identical aircraft, which will be used in the Netherlands. British Air Vice-Marshal Sir Philip Sassoon recently personally inspected British Empire air transportation. According to his talks, the British government has been engaged in developing commercial aviation plans for several months. After the Melbourne competition, it saw Meng Jin again. The government is now considering increasing subsidies to airlines to compete with the Netherlands and France. The total amount of subsidies now is approximately US$2,305,000. It is likely that Congress will soon move to increase it, because the US Postal Aviation alone reaches US$31 million. It is said that a plan is currently under discussion, that is, all letters from the United Kingdom to its territories, except Canada, will be transported by aircraft. The British Post Office will temporarily guarantee 20 tons of mail per week to be sent by air. The current subsidies will expire in 1936. The Cabinet has considered greatly increasing them when renewing the contract. As for the planned routes, there will be two of the world's longest routes, namely London to Brisbane or Melbourne, Australia, and London to Cape Town, South Africa. It is said that the Netherlands also plans to fly twice a week between The Hague and Batavia, each time taking approximately less than five days. Aviation experts here claim that if the United Kingdom must compete with the Netherlands, the UK-Australia route must reach the standard of arriving in seven days, rather than twelve and a half days, to be successful.

<h3>Yugoslavia Accuses Hungary of a Conspiracy in the Marseille Incident, Arousing Great Excitement in Central Europe</h3>
<p>Italy Closely Watches the Developments</p>
<p>League of Nations Can Do Two Things</p>
<p>[Geneva] Yugoslavia's letter to the League of Nations, accusing Hungary of participating in the conspiracy in the Marseille incident, has aroused great excitement in Central Europe. It is heard that Italy is also closely watching the development of this matter. In order to avoid disputes, Yugoslavia has omitted the fact that many terrorist fugitives have fled to Italy. However, it is believed that if Italy intends to protect Hungary, Yugoslavia intends to release all undisclosed information to prove Italy's complicity. If so, it may cause major developments. The Hungarian representative has already requested the League of Nations Secretariat to include Yugoslavia's case accusing Hungary on the agenda of the special meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council next week. The Hungarian representative declared that since the Marseille incident, Yugoslavia has repeatedly criticized Hungary. If this kind of action continues, it will have serious consequences for peace. As the crowd intends that if Yugoslavia can prove that Hungary actually participated in the assassination conspiracy, what the League of Nations can do is, on the one hand, pass a resolution criticizing Hungary's actions, and on the other hand, plan new regulations on suppressing political fugitives. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Hungary Informs the League of Nations of an Early Expression of Meaning</h3>
<p>Spreading False Accusations Hinders Peace</p>
<p>[Geneva] The Hungarian representative, Aichart, recently sent the note of the Hungarian government to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Erwinono, requesting that the Marseille assassination case be included in the agenda of the first meeting of the extraordinary session of the Administrative Council. According to the original plan, the extraordinary meeting of the Administrative Council was scheduled to be held on November 21, but it was postponed due to the unfinished work of the three-person committee on the Saar issue. It may be held on December 3. Whether the extraordinary meeting of the Administrative Council will discuss the Marseille assassination case will be decided when the meeting is held. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>[Geneva] The note of the Hungarian government sent to the League of Nations was originally scheduled to be published in full on Sunday. The League of Nations Secretariat changed its original plan and published the full text of the note tonight. The note stated, "Since the Marseille assassination case occurred, all parties have been vigorously promoting, fabricating facts, and spreading false accusations, making Hungary the target of public criticism. This situation has created a truly dangerous political atmosphere, which is not only unfavorable to the normal relations between several European countries, but actually affects world peace. The application submitted by the Yugoslav government to the Administrative Council of the League of Nations on November 22 and sponsored by the other two Little Entente countries has made the tense situation even more serious. In the application, the Yugoslav government actually blamed Hungary and attributed the responsibility for the detestable crime in Marseille to the Hungarian authorities. If this situation continues to be maintained, if the Hungarian government and authorities continue to be attacked and falsely accused, serious consequences are bound to occur, so that the peace guarantee, which is the most important task of the League of Nations, will be shaken. This is by no means an exaggeration. For this reason, the Hungarian government believes that it is extremely important for the Administrative Council to accept the case submitted by the Yugoslav government and immediately examine it. What the Hungarian government has to declare is that the sole purpose of the Yugoslav government's move is to undermine the name of the entire Hungarian nation, which is related to the life and death of Hungary and has to be defended. It is within the inherent authority of the Administrative Council to accept all issues affecting world peace. For this reason, it is specially requested that the Administrative Council include the case on the agenda of the current extraordinary meeting as soon as possible, so that the current dangerous situation can be alleviated. The Hungarian government believes that the Administrative Council should pay good attention to this situation. Signed by Aichart." (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Shaw Is Sick</h3>

<h3>Yugoslav Foreign Minister Issues Another Declaration</h3>
<p>Meeting of the Three Foreign Ministers of the Little Entente</p>
<p>[Geneva] After the Hungarian government's note to the League of Nations Secretariat was published, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Yevtic issued a declaration to this agency, stating, "The Hungarian government believes that the Marseille assassination case should be submitted for discussion at this extraordinary meeting of the Administrative Council. This is exactly what Yugoslavia means, because Yugoslavia also advocated early consideration of the case. Due to the urgent request of several major countries, I agreed that the Yugoslav application would be considered at the Administrative Council meeting in January next year." (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>[Geneva] The Hungarian representative to the League of Nations, Aichart, received a letter from the League of Nations Secretariat stating that, according to the request of the Yugoslav government, the political background and motives of the Marseille assassination case have been included on the agenda of the Administrative Council in January next year. (National dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>[Geneva] Czech Foreign Minister Benes, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Yevtic, and Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu held a long meeting this evening to organize the Yugoslav memorandum. The memorandum contains various facts proving the Yugoslav application and will be submitted to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Erwinono, on Sunday morning. The foreign ministers of the three Little Entente countries then jointly considered the possible results of Hungary's request to advance the discussion of the Marseille assassination case. No communiqué was issued after the meeting of the three foreign ministers. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Explanation of the Franco-Russian Entente</h3>
<p>[Paris] Although the French and Russian governments have denied the claim made by Army Budget Reporter Achambord that France and Russia have concluded a military alliance to deal with the Franco-German war, Achambord still explained it with mitigating words today, saying that what he called the "Franco-Russian Entente" refers to "If Germany attacks France, Russia will, in accordance with the League of Nations treaty, assist France in defending European peace with air and land forces using mutual assistance methods." This explanation was made by Achambord in an interview with the Associated Press, which can overturn the explanation of the House of Representatives that another treaty has been concluded with Soviet Russia, because what he refers to is that Russia will unite with France in accordance with the provisions of the League of Nations treaty. Officials are no longer making explanations now. (National News Agency dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>[Paris] French Foreign Minister Laval and Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov met in Geneva. French newspapers continue to discuss its value in detail. Le Petit Parisien said, "This meeting was indeed sincere and cordial, and it was not a diplomatic agreement." Some newspapers said that their talks focused mostly on the Eastern Pact issue. La Creation said that there has been great progress in solving the Eastern Pact and Franco-Soviet cooperation issues. The newspaper continued, "Anyone who sympathizes with our peace ideas hopes that France can maintain close cooperation with the Soviet Union directly. This is undoubtedly the view of our country's leaders." Le Petit Parisien said that before making any decisions to promote the Eastern Pact, Lai and Li exchanged their personal opinions for the first time, and at the same time expressed their satisfaction with the fact that the stability of Franco-Soviet relations has been confirmed and strengthened.

<h3>United States Sends Note to Germany</h3>
<p>Protesting Suspected Debt Discrimination</p>
<p>[Washington] The United States today sent a strongly worded note to Germany protesting the "unacceptable and dangerous" discriminatory policy taken by Germany in paying interest to American holders of German bonds. The protest was sent by the State Department by telegram to the US Ambassador to Germany, Dodd, for delivery to the German Foreign Ministry. The note stated that the German government's trade and debt policies not only hinder the restoration of proper economic relations in the world, but are also very dangerous. The article criticized Germany for only paying a portion of the interest to the United States, while paying the full amount to other countries. The US government completely rejected the suggestion of paying a portion of the interest in cash and a portion in discount vouchers, and ridiculed Germany's claim that debts can only be repaid after goods are sold directly within the creditor group. The German proposal to handle disputes over the exchange of commodities between the US and Germany was also rejected. (National dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>World Crisis After the Disarmament Conference</h3>
<p>(National News Agency, Geneva Correspondence, November 1934) For nearly a year, government figures from various countries have repeatedly and unanimously advocated for the swift resolution of two major issues: the global economic panic and disarmament. However, throughout the year, despite each person exerting their intelligence and dedicating themselves to resolving these problems through words and thoughts, no satisfactory solution has been achieved. According to general opinion, the reason for the global economic downturn lies in the unbalanced progress of financial and commercial relations between countries. Therefore, some countries have utilized their superior positions to increase spending on propaganda, military, and judicial affairs. Furthermore, due to the lack of sincerity from the victorious nations of the Treaty of Versailles in disarmament, a global crisis has formed. Countries, instead of disarming, are increasing their military strength to suppress the weak, creating mutual suspicion and hindering genuine disarmament. If countries had initially treated each other with sincerity, the Disarmament Conference and the World Economic Conference would not have been in vain. Now, countries have almost completely buried the ideas of economic improvement and disarmament. Superficially, these problems seem to have been resolved, but whether they will benefit the people of each nation remains to be seen in future events. The Disarmament Conference should not only seek world peace but also be responsible for rescuing the world's depressed economic situation. Japan was the first to realize that the Disarmament Conference had no value in revitalizing the global economy, leading countries to increase their military strength instead. Japan's conquest of Manchuria is no different from a death knell for those in Geneva who strive to mediate disarmament. Although the Geneva side has made great efforts to stop Japan from implementing its plans to expand its military and territorial policies, its efforts have ultimately been ineffective. Soviet Russia does not want to confront Japan in the Far East and cause conflict. As for Washington, it is still determined to build 120 units of warships to protect its economic interests in the Far East and seek to connect with Manila. The Manchurian state is an excuse for expanding military strength in the Far East, while in Europe, France is using Germany's domestic actions as an excuse to unite its friendly countries and attack Geneva by land, sea, and air, accusing Germany and France of having unnamed enemies. Therefore, seeing Japan and France acting in this way, Britain, in order to protect its maritime power, has also repeatedly demanded an expansion of its military strength. Thus, the world's enthusiasm for disarmament, which had lasted for three years, has suddenly turned cold. Countries are all on edge, with rumors spreading everywhere. As a result, in order to defend themselves, the numbers in national financial budgets have suddenly increased. Although Germany's economic difficulties have reached an extreme, it must resolve them itself, not daring to expect foreign assistance, relying solely on its own and the government's rational policies to rescue itself. Germany has special confidence in rescuing its own country, determined not to be like those who expand their military strength in the name of disarmament. Germany's view on disarmament is the same as that of the Italian government, hoping that countries will jointly revise the unequal arms plan. As for the unequal arms plan brought by Sir Eden of Britain, it has never received complete approval from Berlin and Rome. Regarding this matter, Belgian Prime Minister Broqueville once used the name of Belgium to agree with Germany's demand for equality. He believed that Germany is a major power and should not be made to reduce its military strength alone. We must have the courage to abandon useless and meaningless hopes and value the truth of the facts. The Belgian Prime Minister used clear and warning words in the parliament to state this intention. The great powers surrounding Germany should not abandon Germany by using attack methods. If not, there will be no room for friendly alliance in the future. Hitler's peace policy should be well-received by neighboring countries. Facts prove this, such as neighboring Poland, which is now on the path to peace with Germany. Even the Saar and other countries instigated by France have worked hard to break free from political restrictions and seek friendship with Germany. The current disarmament issue has become an issue of arms equality. This is not a matter of one country confronting other countries; it is actually France obstructing all countries. The French government bears a heavy responsibility. Regarding the resolution of the above two major issues, we do not need to look back at the past; let us wait and see in the future. The following issues, such as economic peace or economic competition, arms equality or competitive arms, are entirely in the hands of the governments of each nation. Let us see what happens in the future.</p>

<h3>America Prohibits Japanese from Residing in Guam</h3>
<p>According to the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun, due to Japan's control of gasoline in Manchuria and the issue of prohibiting foreigners from landing in the South Pacific Mandate, the United States has not only verbally protested to Japan but will also adopt extreme blockade and retaliatory measures in its territory of Guam. According to reliable information recently obtained from the South Pacific, before the abandonment of the Washington Treaty, in order to expand the island's military importance, the United States prohibited Japanese from residing there. It is found that there are 280 Japanese residents on the island, many of whom are of mixed race married to locals. They have received American-style education, do not understand Japanese, and are unaware of the situation in Japan. If another 20 or 30 years pass, they will be no different from Americans. Now, the United States considers the island an important location for military transportation and is implementing a blockade policy, with regulations prohibiting Japanese from importing and residing. Any Japanese newly arriving on the island will be prohibited by the American authorities from residing for more than three months to ensure the safety of the islanders. Foreign ships, unless they have obtained permission from the US Navy Department, are refused entry. Currently, only four Japanese ships enter and leave the island. At the same time, according to the island's land law of 1933, the sale of land and property to foreigners is prohibited. Currently, the Japanese government and the public believe that the American blockade of the island will cut off the Japanese bloodline, causing a great shock from top to bottom.</p>
<h3>Insull Acquitted</h3>
<p>Chicago - After two and a half hours of deliberation, a jury in the Federal Court today acquitted Insull and 16 other defendants in the collapse of the Middle West Utilities Company. Insull's son, also one of the defendants, was accused of fraud. Insull said as the jury retired to the deliberation room, "They will acquit them within two hours." The result was almost as expected. After the acquittal, Insull again said, "This is what I expected. I will rest for a while and then work." Prosecutor Cutner announced that he would consult with the Federal Attorney to try the case of Insull's brothers using public funds for private purposes, and said, "Although Insull has been acquitted of fraud, the case of using public funds for private purposes still needs to be tried." Federal Judge Wegerson said in his final instructions to the jury that a lack of commercial judgment cannot be considered the basis for a guilty verdict, but if the defendant has made the risks taken by investors unknown to them, then fraud has been established. Insull's utility business failed in June 1932, at which time he not only lost control of his entire business and his personal assets of US$10 million but also had to leave the United States to avoid intimidation from investors. While Insull was in Paris, the state of Illinois charged him and his sons with using public funds and theft. Insull traveled through various countries, and the US government requested extradition from the governments of France, Germany, and Turkey. Finally, the Turkish government ordered him to leave the country. He hid on a Greek cargo ship for two weeks before finally landing in Turkey, where he was arrested and extradited to the United States. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>
<h3>Standard Oil Company of New York to Recall Bonds</h3>
<p>[New York] It was heard today that Standard Oil Company of New York is following in the footsteps of other oil companies to recall two types of company bonds on February 15th of next year, totaling $28,000,000.

<h3>Salt Merchants Representatives Prepare to Expand Petition</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Zeng Yuyun, representative of the refined salt merchants, said that the two measures approved by the Ministry were ambiguous and could not only protect the sales of refined salt but also cause greater misunderstandings. In the 22nd year of the Republic, the Ministry of Finance approved the output of refined salt at 1.24 million piculs by the Sima scale. Recently, due to the difficulty caused by the tax police, only 580,000 piculs by the Sima scale were sold from January to the end of October this year. It is very clear that refined salt cannot survive. Reluctantly, they plan to expand the petition to various central agencies. (Special Telegram, 25th)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Plans to Cut Off the Source of Local Salt Production</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The Ministry of Finance believes that Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces have always produced local salt. Wherever rivers are silted up, they contain saline and can be dug into ponds and sprinkled for salt, which is harmful to hygiene. The production and sale have always been prohibited. However, locals covet its tax-free and low price and compete to buy and eat it, making the prohibition ineffective. It is urgent to open up the river to change the soil quality of the silted soil. The Ministry of Finance plans to start with Henan Province first, cooperating with the Henan Provincial Government to allocate 30,000 yuan from the salt tax item every month for river management projects. For Hebei and Shandong provinces, strict investigation, reward, and punishment measures will be implemented. If the local government's investigation and prohibition are effective, resulting in an increase in the sales of official salt, a bonus will be given based on the proportion of the increase, with half used for river management and half used for investigation expenses. Those who are ineffective will be punished according to regulations. (Special Telegram, 25th)</p>

<h3>The Evolution of the European Situation</h3>
<p>— (German Correspondence)</p>
<p>Prospects for German-Polish Understanding</p>
<p>Trends in French-Italian Separation</p>
<p>In Europe, there are two distinct currents of major struggles. In principle, it is a struggle between the national unity of nationalism and the world revolution of Bolshevism. In purely international relations, it is a struggle between the German and Slavic nations. Since Hitler came to power in Germany, although he has experienced some setbacks and suffered some international accusations and domestic criticism, his fate has been favored. After the death of Marshal Hindenburg, who was once highly regarded, he smoothly took over the national government and became the head of Germany. At the same time, Germany's diplomatic difficulties have also been slightly reduced, and the general economy can barely be maintained. The so-called "German spirit" has been sung even louder. The German spirit can also be called the Prussian soul. To explain it with the latest situation, it is based on nationalism and economic alliance to seek the development of economic unity in Central Europe. The historical origin of this statement is very long. It is not a new theory that has emerged recently. However, since Hitler came to power, the German economy has found a way out.</p>
<p>Germany has skilled industrial workers, excellent factory organization, and meticulous political training. Among the countries in the world, he should be second to none in the above points. Unfortunately, his food supply is insufficient, and the rest of the raw materials cannot fully supply his industrial development. Therefore, he must ally with Poland in the east and Italy in the south to find a basis for agricultural resources and find a sea passage in the Mediterranean. Then, the situation of being locked in the north by England and strangled in the west by France will have a way out. Not only can he survive, but he can also be sufficient to fight.</p>
<p>Between Germany, Italy, and Poland, there are two difficult problems to solve: (1) the Polish Corridor, which separates Germany into two pieces, thus deepening the separation between Germany and Poland, and making it difficult to eliminate the Germans' hatred of Poland. At the same time, this is also a problem for the whole of Europe. (2) The issue of Austria merging with Germany. This matter has been going on for a long time. Austria itself, of course, benefits most from merging with Germany, because it has lost its independence in terms of economy and politics. Relying on foreign debt to support and attaching to a great power is not a long-term solution. If Germany and Austria merge, Italy will be the first to be affected, thus causing discord between Germany and Italy. Until now, Italy's guard against this is still very serious, fearing that Austria will break away from Italy's control and merge with Germany.</p>
<p>If these two problems can be properly resolved, then the national spirit of Germany, Italy, and Poland is similar. Speaking of material resources, Poland has very rich coal and iron, and Italy lacks these things. Germany uses its industrial technology to supply them, plus agricultural countries such as Romania, then the economic alliance of Central Europe is not necessarily impossible, which is what Mussolini, Hitler, Piłsudski, and others dream of day and night. Furthermore, Poland is reaching out to Ukraine, and Germany naturally wants to take the opportunity to peep into the Soviet Union and help Poland to seek eastern land, using the newly acquired land to exchange for the corridor that separates East Prussia from the main body of Germany. Therefore, at the beginning of this year, Germany and Poland first established a ten-year non-aggression treaty. This is a transformation in German diplomacy and a new trend in Polish diplomacy. In other words, it is the so-called prelude to the Central European Economic Alliance.</p>
<p>If this idea ultimately becomes a dream, then seeking a way out to the Baltic Sea is also a method. Thus, Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia have become important and tense, because if they cannot attack the Soviet Union at any moment and cannot get Ukraine, they will turn their edge to the three small countries. In terms of geographical and historical relations, Marshal Piłsudski was born in Vilnius and can even be said to be Lithuanian. With this reason, he can take the opportunity to launch a movement. What's more, the three small countries have no self-defense strength at all. With a little pressure, they can achieve their wish. It is not a problem to solve them with the combined strength of Germany and Poland. However, there is still a relationship with the Treaty of Versailles, which involves France. In the current situation, the Soviet Union is a very important member, and he will never stand idly by and let things change naturally. However, Finland and the Soviet Union are working very hard. If Germany and Poland completely control the Baltic Sea, they can connect with Finland, and the power to promote the Central European Economic Alliance will be even greater. However, the deepening of the French-Soviet understanding is invisibly sufficient to hinder the progress of this event. But the future is still very chaotic, and the struggle is getting fiercer.

<h3>Japanese in Harbin Forcibly Seizing Civilian Land</h3>
<p>Rigorously Enforced by the Japanese East Asia Company</p>
<p>A One-Time Expropriation of 75,000 "Shang" of Civilian Land</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: The Japanese in Harbin, under the pretext of implementing urban planning, are having the puppet government buy up all privately-owned land within the designated area, and then leasing it back to the people. Starting this month, the first</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>batch of land to be purchased amounts to 75,000 "Shang" (one "Shang" equals ten "Mu"). The Japanese East Asia Development Company is rigorously enforcing this. The standard price of the land and other details are signed by the puppet mayor, Lü Ronghuan, and a public notice was issued on the first of this month. Because the prices set are far too disparate and because after the purchase, the land is being re-leased, suggesting an intention to seize the people's wealth by trickery, the citizens are filled with complaints. Here are the details we have gathered:</p>
<p>(1) Standard Prices</p>
<p>Type  Grade  Price per "Shang" (Puppet Currency in Yuan)</p>
<p>Vegetable Land   First Grade  250</p>
<p>Second Grade  200</p>
<p>Third Grade  150</p>
<p>Cultivated Land   First Grade  120</p>
<p>Second Grade  100</p>
<p>Third Grade  80</p>
<p>Fourth Grade  60</p>
<p>Fifth Grade  40</p>
<p>Ungraded Land   40</p>
<p>Barren Land   First Grade  30</p>
<p>Second Grade  20</p>
<p>Third Grade  10</p>
<p>Ungraded Land  5</p>
<p>(2) Purchase Procedures: 1. For designated purchased land, the land owner and land mortgage holder must immediately submit all land deeds and related documents to the Land Purchase Office and receive instructions. 2. When submitting the land deed, the municipal government issues land deed bonds. 3. Once the land grade is determined, and the deed and other procedures are completed, the land price will be paid. However, the payment of the land price is limited to the Municipal Government.</p>
<p>(3) Cultivation of Purchased Land and Compensation for Surface Objects: 1. The land owner or tenant, after the purchase, has the right to preferentially borrow and cultivate the land before the municipal government uses it. The rent or usage fee will be determined separately. 2. The condition of homes, cultivated land, and other surface features must not be altered. If there are instances of adding or rebuilding on the house foundation, permission from the puppet mayor must first be obtained. 3. For houses, trees, tombs, and other surface objects, if deemed necessary for urban planning, subsidies or relocation fees will be provided appropriate to the object.</p>
<p>(4) Notice: The puppet mayor also proclaimed that anyone spreading rumors, fabricating facts, deliberately obstructing the progress of the matter, or disrupting the order and tranquility regarding the land purchase will be severely punished. All residents of this city should trust the nation's undertakings and not act rashly, lest they violate the law, etc. (Northeast News Agency)</p>

<h3>Ji Hongchang and Ren Yingqi Handed Over by Hong Kong for Trial</h3>
<p>Detained by the Military Law Department of the Military Affairs Commission</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The shooting case that occurred at the National Hotel in the Tianjin French Concession at 8 PM on the 10th of last month, in which Ji Hongchang and Ren Yingqi were injured but not killed, has been resolved. Ji was on a wanted list, and Ren was found to be carrying solid evidence of treason.

Yesterday (the 21st), he received a reply ordering them to be handed over to the Military Affairs Commission in Beiping for interrogation. After receiving the order, the Hebei Provincial Government had Ji and Ren and two suspects transported from Tianjin this afternoon (the 22nd) on a railway carriage attached to an extra train. They arrived in Beiping at 4:55 PM. The escorting officers were Gao Baogui, the platoon leader of the Hebei Provincial Government Guard, Liu Peiji, the adjutant of the 51st Army, and eight fully armed guards. Ji Hongchang was wearing a black woolen cloak, his cheeks were full of whiskers, and his spirits were still high. Ren Yingqi was wearing a woolen coat, his face was grayish-blue.

However, Ji and Ren had not had lunch since being released at 12:00 PM, so they agreed with Platoon Leader Gao and Adjutant Liu to go to the Xilaishun Muslim Restaurant on Xi'an Street for a meal to satisfy their hunger. At around 6:00 PM, they were transported by the original cars to the Military Affairs Commission and handed over to the Military Law Department for detention. The escorting soldiers left Beiping at 8:15 PM that evening to return to Tianjin to report on their mission. (22nd)</p>
<h3>Eastern Route Army Searched and Suppressed Remnants of Bandits on the Fujian Border</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The bandit suppression issue in the border area between Fujian and Jiangxi has now come to an end. Regarding local rehabilitation matters, Tingzhou is being handled by Lin Sixian, the Administrative Commissioner of the Eighth District. The Nanchang Pacification Headquarters has remitted 20,000 yuan as relief funds for refugees returning to Tingzhou, ordering that the returning refugees be settled first before discussing other constructions. Yanzhou is being handled by Chen Zhuoru, the Administrative Commissioner of the Seventh District, but progress is extremely difficult due to financial constraints. Chen arrived in Fuzhou from Longyan yesterday to visit Chen Yi, the Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government, to request an appropriation for assistance. Recent bandit suppression military operations in northern and eastern Fujian have also made great progress. In northern Fujian, the remnants of bandits in Mingxi and Qingliu counties have retreated to Ninghua after being encircled and suppressed by Lu Xingrong's division. However, Pucheng and Jianyang counties are still disturbed by scattered bandits. Wei Lihuang, the Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Route Front, has dispatched troops to search and suppress them. In eastern Fujian, after the two divisions led by Lin Zhiyuan, a member of the Provincial Government, encircled and suppressed the bandits, the bandit forces have gradually subsided. The so-called four heroes of the Red Bandits in eastern Fujian, Lai Jinbiao, Ren Tiefeng, Ma Liefeng, and Fan Tiemin, Lai Jinbiao's gang has been killed by Gu's regiment of the □ division in Xibing, Fu'an. Ren Tiefeng's gang has fled to the border between Fu'an and Taishun, Ma Liefeng's gang has fled to the border between Fu'an and Ningde, and Fan Tiemin's gang is lurking on the coast between Fuding and Xiapu. All have no ability to move. (November 24)</p>
<h3>Reorganization of Security Forces in Fujian Province</h3>
<p>To Be Completed Before the End of the Year</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: There are a total of sixteen regiments of security forces in Fujian Province. They were reorganized from the local militia by the Security Department after the Fujian Incident was quelled this spring. The positions of regiment and battalion commander were filled by the original leaders. However, these militia members were mostly untrained and difficult to control. After several mutinies, several regiments have been dismissed. For the rest, many have been reorganized by assigning military school graduates to be regiment and battalion commanders for consolidation. However, there are still gaps in opinions between officers and soldiers. The Security Department has now been ordered to reorganize, with Chen Yi, the Chairman of the Provincial Government, serving as the Security Commander, and Xiao Gan, the Deputy Director, being promoted to Director. The security forces will be thoroughly reorganized to facilitate training. Recently, Director Xiao Qian went to southern Fujian to inspect the status of the security forces stationed in various locations as a standard for reorganization and formulated the following reorganization plan: (1) Name: (A) Regular Regiments: Regiments will be renamed "Fujian Provincial Security Regiment No. X", battalions will be renamed "Battalion No. X", and companies will be renamed "Company No. X, and machine gun, mortar, and special companies", platoons will be renamed "Platoon No. X". (B) Special Duty Regiments: Except that battalions, companies, and platoons will still be reorganized according to item A, the name of the regiment will be changed to "Fujian Provincial Security Special Duty Regiment". (C) Independent Battalions: Battalions will be renamed battalions. For example, Independent Battalion No. X will be renamed Fujian Provincial Security Independent Battalion No. X, and companies and platoons will follow item A. (D) Independent Companies: Companies will be renamed "Fujian Provincial Security Independent Company No. X", and platoons will follow item A. (2) Organization: The number and designation of battalions and companies under a regiment will be changed according to the existing ones. For example, if there are only two battalions, they will be changed to the First and Second Battalions. If each battalion currently has only three companies, they will be changed to three companies. If each battalion currently has two companies, they will be changed to two companies, etc. (3) Personnel: (A) All personnel in the newly promulgated organization who are not in the current organization, such as martial arts instructors in companies, will not be assigned. (B) All personnel who are not in the new organization but are in the current organization and surplus personnel will be dismissed. (C) Instructors and assistants will be changed to waiting for assignment and will continue to serve in their original regiments and receive their original salaries. (D) In addition to the new organization, each team and battalion headquarters will set up one lieutenant waiting for assignment to handle adjutant allocation duties. (E) All dismissed personnel will be paid their November salaries. Each officer will receive 10 yuan for resettlement expenses, and each soldier will receive 2 yuan. The dispatching of personnel can be started in about a few days, and the entire process will be completed by the end of the year. (November 22)</p>
<h3>Collapse of Communist Bandits in Huizhou</h3>
<p>Liu Zhenhua Arrives in Wuhu to Meet Yang Yongtai</p>
<p>Anhui's 4 Million Public Bonds Are Difficult to Issue</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Liu Zhenhua, the Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, established an administrative office in Tunxi, Huizhou, on October 2, and stationed troops to supervise the suppression of bandits in Huizhou. Now that the large bandit groups have been completely dispersed, Chairman Jiang happened to go to Nanjing from Ganzhou yesterday. Liu accompanied Ma Lingfu, the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs who had gone to Huizhou for inspection, and Zhu Runze, the Chief of the General Staff, in cars to Wuhu, intending to go to Nanjing to visit Jiang and report on the bandit suppression situation. However, Yang Yongtai, the Secretary-General of the Nanchang Pacification Headquarters, was scheduled to pass through Wuhu today (the 22nd) on his way to Nanjing and had previously telegraphed Liu to meet him in Wuhu. Therefore, after arriving in Wuhu, Liu stayed at the Dahua Hotel on Zhongshan Road to wait for Yang. Heads of military, police, and administrative agencies, leaders of gentry, merchants, and various organizations all visited that evening. Takeyoshi Sadaharu, the Japanese Consul in Wuhu, also visited. According to Ma Lingfu, the Red bandits in Huizhou were mostly annihilated after being fiercely suppressed by the various armies under the command of Chairman Liu. However, a small number of remnants have fled to the borders of counties such as Zhide and Taiping. The counties are now rushing to complete the Baojia system and build blockhouses to prevent bandits from hiding and permanently eliminate future troubles. Next, he described the disaster relief situation in the province, saying that the relief grain received in Anhui has been distributed to more than 40 counties, including Taihu, Huaining, and Qimen, according to the severity of the disaster, totaling approximately 20,000 "Shi". As for the 4 million yuan of disaster relief bonds planned to be issued, it was originally decided to use the salt tax surcharge as a guarantee fund, but Minister Kong Rong agreed to the additional items. Therefore, the issuance of the 4 million bonds is feared to be difficult to achieve. Today (22nd) at 11:00 AM, Yang Yongtai arrived in Wuhu by Jiangxin steamer. Liu Zhenhua boarded the ship for a meeting lasting one hour before disembarking separately. Yang took the original ship to Nanjing, and Liu immediately canceled his trip to Nanjing. At 1:00 PM in the afternoon, he still took a car and returned to Tunxi. Liu Dechong, the new Commissioner of Bandit Suppression Supervision for the three provinces of Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi, newly appointed by Chairman Jiang, also traveled with him in order to eliminate the remnant bandits as scheduled. Ma Lingfu also returned to Anqing by boat after Liu left Wuhu. (November 22)</p>
<h3>Entire Territory of Laoshan Placed Under the Jurisdiction of Qingdao City</h3>
<p>An Area of 190 Square Kilometers</p>
<p>With a Population of Approximately 30,000</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Han Fuju, the Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, believes that Laoshan, within the jurisdiction of Jimo County, is adjacent to Qingdao City. Since Shen Honglie became the head of Qingdao, he has sent workers to repair the narrow mountain roads in Laoshan, turning them all into smooth thoroughfares. He has also dispatched naval marines to be stationed in places such as Xia Qing Palace, Wanggezhuang, and Laoshanwei to protect the residents and reassure tourists. To facilitate governance, Han now intends to place all of Laoshan under the jurisdiction of Qingdao City, so that Shen can manage it with all his heart and turn it into a scenic spot in the East China Sea. When Zhang Shaotang, the Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, and Zhang Honglie, the Director of the Construction Department, came to Qingdao to attend the shipyard completion ceremony a few days ago, they went to Laoshan to survey the boundary demarcation. However, due to the overlapping mountains, it was not easy to walk, and it was not possible to complete the survey in a short time. They discussed with Shen, ordering the Qingdao Public Works Bureau to first draft a boundary demarcation plan, and then the Qingdao Municipal Government, the Shandong Civil Affairs Department, the Construction Department, and the Jimo County Government would send personnel to form a boundary demarcation committee to review and finalize it. It is now heard that the Municipal Public Works Bureau has drafted the plan and consulted the two Shandong Provincial Departments of Civil Affairs and Construction to quickly send personnel to Qingdao to form a boundary demarcation committee to start the boundary demarcation work. The outline of the boundary demarcation plan is recorded below:</p>
<p>Boundary Line</p>
<p>Starting from the southwest river fork of Liujiaying, it extends northeast through the west of Caocun, the north of Xinjiazhuang, the north of Da Houjiazhai, the north of Houjingou, to the south of Tieqi. All are bounded by the river. From Tieqi to the northeast, a straight line passes through the small ridge north of Tieqi Mountain and connects with the small river on the east side. From the west end of this small river, it extends east to Xigejia Bridge, bounded by this small river. From the north of Xigejia Bridge, it turns to the northeast for about 700 meters, bounded by the west bank of the big river. From here, it turns to the southeast, crosses the big river, crosses the north-south ridge, and passes through Daqiao to the west of Xia Miao. All are bounded by the avenue. Then, it goes east through the west of Wangjiatuzhai, the southwest of Jiangjiatuzhai, and then east to the sea, all bounded by the river. Then, a straight line is extended eastward from the river mouth to divide the sea and islands into north and south. The northern part belongs to Jimo, and the southern part belongs to Qingdao.</p>
<p>Area</p>
<p>According to statistics, the area south of the new boundary assigned to Qingdao City is approximately 190 square kilometers, mostly mountainous and hilly land. The annual land tax is approximately 900 taels of silver, and the population is approximately 30,000. (November 24)</p>
<h3>Shandong Province Stipulates Capital for Money Shops</h3>
<p>New Businesses Must Have a Minimum Capital of 30,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Previously, the province supervised the operation of money shops to prevent bankruptcy from affecting the market and implemented twelve temporary measures. Now, the Department of Finance and the Department of Construction have stipulated that the capital of money shops was not previously regulated, and some shops with a capital of less than 1,000 yuan are also called money shops or silver shops. In response to the actual needs, eight supplementary measures have been stipulated, stipulating that all existing shops with a capital of less than 10,000 yuan must be supplemented to 10,000 yuan. Those with less than 1,000 yuan are not allowed to be called money shops or silver shops and operate deposits and withdrawals. The capital of newly opened businesses must be no less than 30,000 yuan. At today's (24th) provincial government meeting, the two departments of finance and construction proposed this case, which was immediately approved. The proposal and supplementary measures are recorded below:</p>
<p>Proposal: The Secretariat reported that the two departments of finance and construction stated in their report that the departments had previously drafted twelve measures for supervising the operation of the money industry in reference to the Banking Law because money shops in the province often went bankrupt. The proposal was submitted to the 238th political affairs meeting of the government, which was resolved and approved as is. The departments, together with the original measures and investigation forms, were ordered to send a list of all money shops in the city to the Jinan Municipal Government. Subsequently, the city government obtained investigation forms of assets, etc., and submitted them to the departments. The departments were also required to send a person and order the Jinan Municipal Government to send a person to conduct a detailed review of the silver shops on the list. According to the report, the Jinan Municipal Money Industry Association submitted a general list of the number of capital increases of each member silver shop on a limited basis and requested instructions, etc. According to the original list of the municipal government, in addition to the households that have already been increased in the capital increase list sent by the Qianye Gonghui, the households that have not been increased or are still less than 10,000 yuan are Hengxiang Silver Shop and eight others. There are also three companies with a capital of less than 1,000 yuan. In addition, there are 13 companies that have not joined the Qianye Gonghui. However, the capital is very important and it is necessary to formulate appropriate standards to facilitate compliance. The departments have stipulated the minimum capital amount for old and new items as follows: (1) All old silver shops with a capital of less than 10,000 yuan should be supplemented to 10,000 yuan, otherwise they will be ordered to stop operations to ensure stability. As for households with less than 1,000 yuan, after reviewing the original list, they are purely of a money stand nature and should only be allowed to exchange silver dollars and sell flour, and should not be called money shops or silver shops to operate money deposits. All new members of the Qianye Gonghui should be ordered to join the association and submit guarantees from the Chamber of Commerce or Qianye Gonghui to comply with the regulations. (2) All new silver shops must have a capital of at least 30,000 yuan, and those with less than 30,000 yuan are not allowed to open. All procedures should still be handled in accordance with the Shandong Province Temporary Measures for Supervising the Operation of the Money Industry. In order to implement the plan carefully, eight supplementary measures have been formulated and submitted. If approved, the departments will announce and implement them. Whether or not to approve should be decided by the public.</p>
<p>Measures (1) All money shops newly opened in the province shall be governed by these measures in addition to the Shandong Province Measures for Supervising the Money Industry. (2) After the implementation of these measures, the capital of newly organized money shops, whether sole proprietorship or joint venture, must reach at least 30,000 yuan, and those with less than 30,000 yuan shall not be called money shops or silver shops and shall not operate silver and money deposits. Also, the capital shall be in cash, and property other than money shall not be used as collateral. (3) Newly organized money shops shall first raise capital and request the Department of Finance to send personnel or appoint the local chief management office to verify the capital and confirm it. On the one hand, in accordance with the list of items listed in Article 4 of the Shandong Province Temporary Measures for Supervising the Operation of the Money Industry, a list shall be submitted to the Department of Finance and the Department of Construction for record, joint inspection, and sent to the Qianye Gonghui or the Chamber of Commerce for guarantee before they are allowed to start business. The Chamber of Commerce shall submit the application to the local competent authorities for submission. (4) In addition to operating within the scope of business listed in the original survey form, each money shop shall not re-operate other industries or be a shareholder of other money shops. (5) Newly opened money shops shall start operations within two months after being approved for registration and opening. After the deadline, the local competent authorities shall report to the Department of Finance for revocation of their registration. (6) If each money shop changes its business or stops business due to business losses or other accidents, it shall first open a case and submit it to the Department of Finance for approval. (7) These supplementary measures shall be implemented on the date of approval and promulgation by the Provincial Government. (8) These supplementary measures may be amended at any time if there are any omissions. (November 24)</p>
<h3>Nanhui</h3>
<p>A Young Man Robs a Large Sum of Money in Broad Daylight</p>
<p>The Gonghe Money Exchange under Shazhen in the Sixth District dispatched a clerk, Kang Bingzhou, to carry 500 yuan in cash to the countryside to buy cotton at 11:00 AM yesterday. When passing near the Liu family cypress tree tomb north of the town, an unknown young man suddenly blocked his path, pulled out a pistol, and immediately robbed Kang of all the money he was carrying. Kang, anxious about the loss of money, ran to the town to report to the merchant corps, which immediately dispatched four members, including Jiang Baocai, to pursue the thief. When they arrived at the Zhoupu Station, they saw the thief hovering, seemingly having missed his train and waiting for a train. The thief knew things were bad and tried to flee, but the members chased after him. As a result, he was captured, and the original 500 yuan in stolen money and a pistol were found. The pistol was even found to be stamped with an official seal. The county government is ordering the case to be solved quickly for thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Revenue Collectors Embezzle Land Tax</p>
<p>Yu Rongsheng, the former revenue collector of the Kunshan County Treasury, secretly partnered with the accountant Tang Xunbo to manage affairs. Later, Tang squandered money on prostitutes, and Yu was bedridden, indulging in opium. Peng Baichuan, the county magistrate, considering this, merged the Kunshan and Xinkun treasuries into one this year and appointed Xie Anbo as the director. After Xie took office, he received the account books and receipts from Yu and Ren and discovered that there was embezzlement of land tax. After the county magistrate sent personnel to verify, he ordered Wu Xingbo, the director of the Xinan Bureau, at 6:00 PM last night to send Luo Zhen, the detective captain of the detective team, to Tang Xunbo's house to arrest Yu Rongsheng. Tang heard the news in the back room and escaped through the window. Yu was taken to the county bureau, and the deputy county magistrate ordered him to be detained pending investigation.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Stealing and Selling Stored Silk Cocoons</p>
<p>The silk cocoon storage in Yefangchang has notified us that the silk cocoon stack is jointly opened by silk merchant Yin Lesheng and others. Since its opening, its reputation has been terrible. Recently, Yin Lesheng has come up with another bizarre idea, colluding with silk cocoon broker Zhu Kuibo to secretly steal ten bales of "Songbai Brand" silk from the Dingchang Silk Factory stored in the stack and handing them over to Zhu. Around 12 o'clock the day before yesterday, they hired workers to load the silk onto a boat and transport it out. The Dingchang Silk Factory found out about this and immediately negotiated with them. They are now preparing to file a criminal lawsuit with the local court, accusing Yin Lesheng and Zhu Kuibo of occupational embezzlement.</p>
<p>Major Fire at Chong'an Temple</p>
<p>The Rongfang Photo Studio in Jia'an Temple, Gongyuan Road, in our city, which was opened by Zhu Zanqing, has been experiencing sluggish business. Therefore, last month, it was rented to Zu Run, the younger brother of Jin Zuyong, a partner in the Lao Bao Hua Photo Studio, for 200 yuan as a transfer fee and 20 yuan as monthly rent. The internal property was valued at over 2,000 yuan. Unexpectedly, at 2:30 PM yesterday (the 24th), a fire broke out accidentally, causing a conflagration. Because the materials used in the studio were mostly paper, which is easy to ignite, it quickly became uncontrollable. Before long, it broke through the roof and spread to the two neighboring dental clinics, Meihua Xuan and Qin Xue Xuan. The residents in the area rang gongs to sound the alarm, and the fire brigades from all sections rushed to the scene with water pumps to put out the fire. However, because the location was in the city center and far from the river, it was quite difficult to draw water from the Gongyuan River pond. It took about two hours to extinguish the fire, which destroyed four houses and caused losses of over 10,000 yuan. The Qin Xue Xuan dental clinic suffered the most severe losses (approximately over 5,000 yuan). The owner of the clinic, Cao Yuchen, had all his furniture made of mahogany. His eldest daughter, Xuezhen, was scheduled to get married on the 27th of this month, and half of her trousseau was burned. Fortunately, Cao Yuchen had insured his property with the Shanghai Shenchang Fire Insurance Company for 1,500 taels, and he can send a letter to claim compensation. Although the Lao Bao Hua Photo Studio was not directly affected, all the property upstairs and downstairs was waterlogged, resulting in significant losses. The others' newspapers were adjacent to Lao Bao Hua and suffered a scare. There are various rumors about the cause of the fire, but it is generally believed to have been caused by a cigarette butt falling into paper.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Re-Petitioning for Autumn Survey and Tax Reduction</p>
<p>County Magistrate Hou of Wuyi and representatives of the county's administrative meeting petitioned the provincial government regarding the total exemption of taxes and universal reduction of rates for fields with no harvest. The Finance Department agreed to exempt taxes on 300,000 mu of land with no harvest and to universally reduce the rate by 10%. After County Magistrate Hou and others returned to the county, they immediately convened an autumn survey meeting and decided to send Chen Yingxun and Lü Ze Zhi as representatives to petition the provincial government again. On the morning of the 25th, they went to Zhenjiang and met with Zhao Dihua, the Director of the Finance Department, at the Provincial Farmers' Bank. They stated that Wujin had suffered an unusually severe drought this year, and all fields with no harvest should be exempted from taxes. The universal reduction rate should be increased. After three hours of struggle, Director Zhao finally agreed to a 64% settlement for the Wujin autumn survey (approximately a universal reduction of slightly less than 20%, in addition to the full tax exemption for fields with no harvest). Representatives Chen and Lü returned to Changzhou that evening and will convene meetings in each district within days to discuss methods for reducing tax levies.</p>
<p>Execution by Shooting of the Murderer in the Yu Canrong Assassination Case</p>
<p>Yu Canrong, who lived near Fuqiao in Wuyi City, was assassinated by Zhu Zilin, Chen Fengshan, and others who were bribed by Qiu Yifeng, the officer in charge of the tax office, due to a lawsuit involving slaughter taxes. Zhu Zilin has already been arrested and executed by shooting. Chen Fengshan was recently arrested by the county government. During interrogation, he confessed to participating in the assassination and committing multiple robberies. He was sentenced to death along with Chen Suo'er, another bandit involved in a separate case. The sentences were submitted to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for approval. County Magistrate Hou immediately dispatched police to take the two criminals into custody on the morning of the 25th at approximately 9:00 AM, verified their identities, and escorted them to the Fengweidun execution ground for execution by shooting.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Students Strike Over False Accusation of Theft Against a Good Person</p>
<p>Xie Zhihe, the principal of Yuechengqiao Elementary School, managed all the food expenses for the teachers and boarding students in order to save money. Xu Heshang, a janitor and cook, was hired to do the job. On the 18th, Xu Heshang saved some money by buying vegetables and using a few heads of green vegetables that the students had grown for experimentation. The physical education teacher, Song Xiamin, reprimanded him. Xu was greatly angered. That night, a thief suddenly broke in, stealing clothes and bedding worth over 100 yuan from the teachers and boarding students. Song, the physical education teacher, lost the most, and suspected Xu of doing it out of spite. He immediately ordered Huang Shulang, the night watchman of Yueqiao, to take him to the guardhouse for private torture and beatings. When the parents of the students in the fifth and sixth grades, such as Chen Lan, heard about this, they were greatly angered. They believed that it was wrong to falsely accuse a good person of theft, which incited all the students in the fifth and sixth grades to go on strike. It has already been two days. Xu Heshang has been released on bail. The Education Bureau has been notified and has sent a commissioner to the countryside to investigate.</p>
<p>County Magistrate Bao Dies in Office from Illness</p>
<p>County Magistrate Bao Sixin, who has been in office for over ten months, has been handling county affairs, such as dredging the Dongheng River, and has generally been in harmony with the local people. In August, he suddenly contracted typhoid fever, which was subsequently cured by Chinese and Western medicine. However, he became infected with kidney inflammation due to eating noodles improperly, which then developed into gastritis. He died at 10:00 AM on the 24th after ineffective treatment. The relief center and other agencies have telegraphed the Provincial Government's Department of Civil Affairs, requesting that Secretary Bao Siren (the county magistrate's brother) be appointed as acting county magistrate to ensure local stability. They have also organized a funeral committee to handle all matters. County Magistrate Bao was from Baoshan County, Jiangsu Province, and was 36 years old. His wife, Wang, and eldest daughter, Yizhen, 16 years old, eldest son, Eryi, 14 years old, and second son, Eryi, 7 years old, are all studying in Shanghai. His second daughter, Meizhen, is only 4 years old. The Bao family is a large family in Baoshan and is financially well-off. His wife is currently in office and is extremely grief-stricken.</p>

<p>Provincial Capital Thoroughly Investigates the Dahua Toxic Pills Case</p>
<p>The Ginseng and Velvet Anti-Smoking Pills sold by the Dahua Automobile Company in the county and city had been certified as non-toxic by Dr. Guo Zhixing of the Tongshan Hospital, as designated by the county government, and were approved for sale. Now, the Nantong District Commissioner's Office has repeatedly received complaints stating that the pills contain highly toxic substances. After sending a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau to verify the facts, it was confirmed to be true. Shi Xufu, the accountant of the company, was arrested and taken into custody. Yesterday (the 23rd), the Provincial Anti-Smoking Committee, based on a complaint from Huang Picheng and others, stated that Dr. Guo Zhixing had taken bribes and concealed the facts when verifying the Ginseng and Velvet Anti-Smoking Pills. The Provincial Government ordered a thorough investigation by the county and a report submitted to pursue the matter.</p>

<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Young Child Burned to Death in Late-Night Fire</p>
<p>At 11:55 PM last night (the 24th), a fire suddenly broke out next to the chimney in the home of Feng Lianfu, a resident of No. 7 Maowuqiao, behind the Gongbu Tianxian Tea Garden. The flames shot straight through the roof. Because the neighboring houses were all thatched, the fire spread very quickly. Fortunately, the fire brigade and rescue association arrived to put out the fire. A total of five thatched houses were burned, and Lianfu's young son could not be rescued and died in the fire. The loss is estimated at over 300 yuan. The person responsible for the fire has been detained by the police station for questioning.</p>
<p>Teenager Gambles, Loses, and Attempts Suicide by Drowning</p>
<p>Xu Junsheng, from Anhui, was seventeen years old. His parents died early, so he went to Yixing to rely on his brother-in-law for a living. Xu was young and unrestrained, and especially fond of gambling. He lost a large sum of money, which led to him being driven out. With nowhere to go, he came to Hangzhou to visit his relatives and friends, but was unsuccessful. He was trapped in a hotel, unable to move forward or backward. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, he attempted suicide by drowning in West Lake at the Rainbow Bridge. He was rescued by the police and taken to the police station, where they provided him with assistance.</p>
<p>Supreme Court Investigates Clues in the Shi Case</p>
<p>The Nanjing Supreme Court believes that nearly half a month has passed since the occurrence of the Shi case on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, and there are still no clues to be found. Therefore, it has sent Zheng Lie, the Chief Prosecutor of the Court, and Mo Zongyou, a prosecutor, from Nanjing to Hangzhou to search for evidence in the case in order to solve it. After arriving in Hangzhou, they stayed at Room 100 of the West Lake Hotel. The next morning, they accompanied Zheng Tian, the Chief Prosecutor of the Zhejiang High Court, and Chen Huaming, a prosecutor, to the site of the incident, Bo'ai Town in Haining, for a week-long investigation. They also ordered the vehicle that Shi was riding in when it was attacked to be photographed and taken back for research. Yesterday morning, Zheng Wenli, the President of the High Court, accompanied them to visit various scenic spots in West Lake. They are scheduled to return to Nanjing on the 26th.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Over a Hundred People Poisoned After Eating Wedding Feast</p>
<p>Teng Lianchun, a resident of Hengzhangqiao in the southwest township of Yin County, held a wedding for his second son the day before yesterday (the 22nd). According to custom, guests must be entertained the night before the wedding, and sweet fermented rice soup with glutinous rice balls must be distributed to relatives and neighbors. Lianchun also followed the custom. However, the family was unaware when making the sweet fermented rice and glutinous rice balls and mistakenly added all of their red arsenic (which was intended to be used as poison for vegetable worms) instead of white medicine. The glutinous rice balls were made and distributed as usual. At first, no one noticed anything. However, at the wedding banquet that evening, when the glutinous rice balls were served to the guests, over 130 guests who had eaten them began to vomit, have diarrhea, and experience severe abdominal pain. Yang Yinbao's son, Tianmin, 2 years old, and Yang A Tian's son, Zhengde, 4 years old, died immediately due to their young age and weak bodies. Lianchun realized that the guests had been poisoned and sent an urgent message to Ningbo to invite doctors from Guanghua Hospital to come to the countryside to provide treatment. Fortunately, after treatment, everyone has been pulled from the brink of danger. However, He Shengrong is in critical condition due to the severity of the poisoning.</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Telegraphed Thanks to Trade Associations for Consolation</h3>
<p>The 183 trade associations of silk fabrics, cotton cloths, paper, rice, sugar, ash, wood, woolen fabrics, and North-South goods in this city jointly telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Chiang Dingwen, Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Route Army, and Li Mo'an, Commander of the Tenth Division, expressing their consolation on the victorious military campaign to suppress the bandits and the recapture of the bandit stronghold in Ruijin in the cold weather. They also prayed that they would take advantage of the victory to block and intercept the bandits and achieve complete success. Later, they received a telegram from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek from the Nanchang Camp, which read: "To the Shanghai Silk Fabric Trade Association and all trade associations, your telegram has been received. Ruijin has long been occupied by the Red Bandits, and the local area has suffered greatly. Fortunately, all troops have performed their duties and completely destroyed the bandit stronghold. Your condolences are deeply appreciated and inspiring. In addition to notifying the officers and soldiers at the front, I am sending a telegram to express my gratitude. Chiang Kai-shek, Ma Xingzhi, and Kuan Yin."</p>
<h3>Wusong Eighth District Party Headquarters Telegraphed Congratulations on the Recapture of Ruijin</h3>
<p>The Eighth District Party Headquarters telegraphed congratulations to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and all the officers and soldiers who suppressed the bandits: "To Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing and all the officers and soldiers who suppressed the bandits, the Red Bandits have been causing trouble for seven years. The provinces of Jiangxi, Fujian, Sichuan, and Hunan have suffered greatly. Your Excellency witnessed the difficulties and personally went to the front lines to use well-trained soldiers to defeat the elusive bandits. In recent months, famous cities have been recaptured one after another. With the fall of Ruijin, there are few bandits left. Frequent reports of victory have delighted the entire country. We are sending a telegram to express our condolences. We hope that you will lead the officers and soldiers to take advantage of the victory to pursue and strike them down in one fell swoop. Then the people will be fortunate, and the country will be fortunate. The Executive Committee of the Eighth District Party Headquarters of Shanghai Special Municipality respectfully salutes."</p>
<h3>Song Wang Went to Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Li Ziwen, Liu Weizhi, and Shi Qingyang went to Beijing yesterday on the night express train.</p>
<p>Wang Chonghui went to Beijing yesterday on the 8:00 AM express train.</p>
<h3>He Yingqin Came to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>To Visit His Daughter's Dental Illness</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, He Yingqin, the Minister of Military Affairs and Chairman of the Beiping Branch, came to Shanghai on the night express train on the 24th at approximately 11:00 PM to visit his daughter, Yuzhu, who was suffering from a dental illness. After getting off the train, he went straight to his residence to rest. He and his wife, Wang Wenxiang, then went to a hospital in western Shanghai to visit his daughter. He visited her again yesterday morning. He Yingqin's visit was solely to visit his daughter's dental illness, so he did not meet with people from all walks of life. He will stay in Shanghai for about three days before returning to Beijing. The date of his return to the north will be determined after the Fifth Plenary Session is closed.</p>
<h3>Zhou Shouyu, Representative of the Guangdong Business Federation, Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Successful Petitioning to the Legislative Yuan and Others</p>
<p>Urging Yang Ziyi to Take Office in Zhongshan County</p>
<p>Zhou Shouyu, the representative of the Guangdong Provincial Business Federation, came to Shanghai from Hong Kong a few days ago and went to Beijing. He returned to Shanghai yesterday morning after completing his official duties and stayed at the Xin Xin Hotel. According to Zhou, he told reporters who visited him that he went to see Finance Minister Kong upon arriving in Beijing. Because Kong was in Shanghai, he was received by Secretary Lu. He immediately informed Secretary Lu that there were rumors in Guangdong Province that the Ministry of Finance intended to require all goods entering Guangdong from overseas to pay taxes at the Hong Kong and Kowloon Customs (which would be waived if the goods were sold in Hong Kong). This would be extremely detrimental to industry and commerce in Guangdong Province. Therefore, businessmen and people from all walks of life held meetings to oppose it and sent him to Beijing to petition. Later, telegrams came saying that there was no such thing. The Business Federation asked him to come to Beijing to investigate in order to clarify the truth and requested detailed guidance. Secretary Lu replied that the Ministry of Finance had no such intention. He had previously received official letters from the Guangdong Provincial Government and other parties asking for instructions, and he had replied separately. He then introduced him to Wu, the section chief of the Customs Administration. Mr. Wu also said that such news was completely unfounded. The Kowloon Customs has been established for many years, and the Customs Administration would definitely know if taxes were to be collected in Hong Kong. There were no such plans. He asked to reassure everyone. He also went to the Legislative Yuan to meet with President Sun and Secretary-General Liang Hancao regarding the Guangdong stamp tax issue and Article 681 of the Civil Code on Debt, which stipulates that partners are jointly and severally liable for debts and that the rights and obligations are not balanced and should be revised. The two of them received him personally. He first reported to President Sun the recent situation in Zhongshan County and the public's desire for Mr. Yang Ziyi to take office as the County Magistrate of Zhongshan. Then, he raised two issues. Secretary-General Liang replied that the Stamp Tax Law had been passed (as reported in the newspapers), and the abolition of the Guangdong special law was only a matter of time. The new law was satisfactory to businessmen. As for the revision of Article 681, he had received requests and opinions from all parties, and he also thought it should be considered, but it had not yet been finalized. Because his questions had been answered satisfactorily, he left and visited Mr. Yang Ziyi, conveying the eagerness of the townspeople. Yang said that if the model county system continued to exist, he would be happy to serve, but the date of his departure for Guangdong had not yet been determined. It is reported that Zhou will return south to report back after completing his official duties within days.</p>
<h3>US Ambassador to Russia Left for Soviet Union Yesterday Morning for Sightseeing</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Return to the Country by Ship Tomorrow</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, US Ambassador to Soviet Russia, Mr. Bullitt, came to China for sightseeing this time. After arriving in Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday, the local American community held a banquet for him that evening. Because Bullitt had long heard of the famous scenic spot of Tiger Hill in Suzhou, he took advantage of the convenience of arriving in Shanghai and took the early express train to Suzhou yesterday morning at 8:00 AM for a day trip. He is scheduled to return to Shanghai by train early today, visit Mayor Wu, and then leave Shanghai tomorrow morning on the McKinley President, a ship of the Dollar Steamship Company, to return to the country.

It is reported that the meeting has now been completed. Shu took the night express train from Beijing and returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. He originally planned to continue his work, but because yesterday was a Sunday, it was a day off as usual. Therefore, it was decided to continue the inventory starting this morning.</p>
<h3>The Second New Ship of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the Haiheng, Arrived in Shanghai from England Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Docked in the Third Dock of Jiangnan Shipyard for Inspection</p>
<p>Ma Jiajun, Zhang Guoquan, Shi Ruichang, and Others Came Together</p>
<p>The second of the four ocean-going ships built in England by the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company using Sino-British Boxer Indemnity funds, the Haiheng, arrived at the No. 3 New Dock of the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy Department in Gaochangmiao, Shanghai, at 7:30 AM yesterday.

<p>Arrived in Shanghai from England</p>
<p>The Haiheng set sail for China from the Newcastle shipyard at 5:00 PM on October 4th, passing through the Strait of Gibraltar, Marseilles, the Suez Canal, Aden, Colombo, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Due to fog in the Fujian-Zhejiang waters, the speed was reduced for safety, and it did not arrive at the Wusong Estuary until 11:00 PM the night before last. It immediately anchored there. At 5:00 AM yesterday morning, it sailed directly to the pier of the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy Department in Gaochangmiao and docked. The time was 7:00 AM.</p>
<p>Personnel Arriving Together</p>
<p>Ma Jiajun, the captain, Zhang Guoquan, the chief engineer, and Shi Ruichang, an engineer, who were sent by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to England for training, all arrived in Shanghai with the ship. The ship's navigation along the way was handled by personnel sent by the shipbuilding factory, including the captain, chief mate, second mate, chief engineer, second engineer, third engineer, and radio operator, all of British nationality, totaling seven people. There were also three Chinese sailors, three stokers, four helmsmen, one steward, and one chief steward, totaling nineteen people. After the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company takes over the ship, the British crew members will return to their country by ship.</p>
<p>Docking for Inspection</p>
<p>After arriving at Gaochangmiao, the Haiheng docked at the third new dock of the Jiangnan Shipyard at 7:30 AM. The Shanghai representative of the Newcastle Shipyard, the Malkan Company, sent engineers to board the ship at 3:00 PM to inspect various machinery and equipment. The inspection is scheduled to be completed within one or two days, and then the Jiangnan Shipyard will be responsible for painting. It is scheduled to be completed next Tuesday, and then it will be taken out of the dock and sailed to the Jinliyuan Wharf. It is reported that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has scheduled the official takeover for the 29th of this month.</p>
<p>Sailing to Southern China</p>
<p>The construction of the second Haiheng ship is exactly the same as the first Haiyuan ship. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has scheduled the official takeover for the 29th. There will be no ceremony at that time. It will sail from Shanghai to Xiamen, Shantou, and Guangzhou on its maiden voyage. After the maiden voyage returns to Shanghai, it will officially start operating and join the Shanghai-Xiamen-Shantou-Guangzhou line.</p>
<h3>Anhui Provincial Government Plans to Issue Four Million Yuan in Disaster Relief Bonds</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance is Currently Reviewing the Guarantee</p>
<p>Director Mao Visited Kong to Report on the Disaster Situation</p>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, the Anhui Provincial Government has requested the Central Government to issue 4 million yuan in disaster relief bonds to provide relief due to the severe drought this year. A reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency met with Mao Longzhang, the Director of Finance of the province, yesterday to inquire about everything. According to his statement, the Ministry of Finance is currently reviewing the guarantee for the bonds. After the review is completed, the Executive Yuan can approve the issuance. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Motivation for Issuance</p>
<p>According to Director Mao, Anhui Province has suffered an unusually severe drought this year, with the worst affected areas being in southern and central Anhui. The northern part of Anhui, such as Bengbu and the area north of the Huai River, is less affected. The disaster area is vast, and there are many refugees. The cold winter has arrived, and the refugees are in urgent need of relief from hunger and cold. However, the recent financial resources of Anhui Province are not enough to cover administrative expenses, let alone provide relief to the refugees. In view of this, the Provincial Government has specially requested the Central Government to approve the issuance of 4 million yuan in Anhui Province disaster relief bonds in order to handle relief matters.</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Review</p>
<p>The method of issuing the bonds and the guarantee have been reported to the Central Government. The Executive Yuan has now handed it over to the Ministry of Finance to review the reliability of the collateral. It is reported that the Ministry of Finance is currently conducting a review. Once the review is qualified, the Executive Yuan can approve it, submit it to the Legislative Yuan for review, and then report it to the Central Political Committee for filing and issuance. The collateral for the bonds is the business tax revenue and land tax revenue of Anhui Province.</p>
<p>Visiting Kong to Report</p>
<p>Director Mao came to Shanghai this time to negotiate a loan of 1.2 million yuan with the banking industry for the province's administrative expenses. The results of the negotiations were quite good, and they were mostly agreed upon. After Director Mao arrived in Shanghai, he visited Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi to report on the disaster situation in the province and the collateral for the bonds. Director Mao decided to sign the loan contract in Shanghai and then return to Anhui to report.</p>
<h3>Dai Ji Moved His Family to Suzhou Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Dai Ji, the former Commander of the Songhu Garrison, stayed in Shanghai to recuperate after leaving his post and lived in a private residence on Shanzhong Road. He rarely interacted with the outside world. Dai had an old residence in Suzhou. Because Shanghai was noisy and not suitable for long-term residence, he and his family took a special Beijing-Shanghai express train yesterday afternoon and left Shanghai for Suzhou.</p>
<h3>Yangtze River Ships Reduce Rice Transportation Fees by Half</h3>
<p>Executive Yuan Responds to the National Federation of Commerce</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce previously telegraphed the Executive Yuan requesting it to order the authorities of Sichuan and Hunan provinces to exempt rice donations in order to resist the circulation of foreign rice and preserve the stock of grain and to order Yangtze River ships to reduce transportation fees to maintain the people's food supply. The association received a reply from the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan yesterday: "The case was previously based on your association's telegram of September 23, requesting the authorities of Sichuan and Hunan provinces to exempt rice donations and to order Yangtze River ships to reduce transportation fees in order to resist foreign rice and circulate the stock of grain. The case was sent to the Ministries of Finance and Communications for consideration. The Ministry of Communications replied that the original telegram had been copied and sent to the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Shanghai Shipping Association for review. The company replied that it had requested Shanghai colleagues to consider the proposal to charge half price for the freight of rice and grain exported from various places, but colleagues did not agree, so it was difficult to implement. It was previously telegraphed to the Ministry, and a report will be submitted after the reduction method is agreed upon. Years have passed, and the opinions of colleagues have not been consistent, and the domestic agricultural and commercial depression has become increasingly obvious. Shipping companies in various places are not smooth with imports and exports, and there are more ships and less goods. Competition is becoming more fierce. In the past six months, freight rates have been reduced without increase, especially for rice and grain. As a result, shipping costs are becoming more and more expensive, while freight rates are becoming more and more cheap. As far as rice and grain are concerned, freight rates have fallen repeatedly. According to the current situation, it has been reduced to the lowest limit. There is no profit to be made except for paying for labor costs. If the reduction is made again according to the current price, not only will the opinions of the colleagues not be able to be reached, but also the company's shipping costs will be difficult to maintain. Therefore, it is difficult to comply with the request of the National Federation of Commerce to reduce the freight of rice transported by Yangtze River ships. It is not possible, please be informed, please copy the recent rice freight rate table for your review and re-reply. Enclosed is a copy of the rice freight rate table for each port. The association replied that it had been submitted to the Executive Committee for discussion and decided to approve the reduction of freight by half according to the prescribed price and to try it for six months. In addition to notifying the members of the Yangtze River route to check, it should be prepared and reported for approval and implementation. The corresponding copy of the attached list of rice freight rates for each port is enclosed for your information. This is addressed to the National Federation of Commerce, Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan. The rice freight rate table for each port is listed below: Shanghai to Yichang: 7 jiao 7 fen 5 li per metric ton, Shanghai to Shashi: 4 jiao 9 fen 6 li per metric ton, Shanghai to Xiangtan: 2 jiao 9 fen 8 li per metric ton, Shanghai to Nanjing: 2 jiao 2 fen 5 li per metric ton, Shanghai to Zhenjiang: 2 jiao 8 fen 5 li per metric ton."</p>
<h3>Portuguese Aviator's Telegram Announces End to Flight to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Bad Weather Forces Immediate Flight to Hong Kong for Return to Country</p>
<p>Portuguese youth aviators, Mr. Lao Baipao and Mr. Jiwa, departed from Lisbon, Portugal at the end of last month aboard the "Lai He Paide" airplane for a long-distance flight to the Far East. After arriving in Hong Kong, they took off from Hong Kong at 7:00 AM on the 24th of this month, scheduled to arrive in Shanghai around 2:00 PM that afternoon. The Portuguese Consul-General, Mr. Orwis, the Vice-Consul, Mr. Balaika, and Portuguese residents in Shanghai were planning a grand welcome. However, when the plane was about to reach Fuzhou, due to severe weather conditions with thick fog covering the sky making it difficult to discern direction, they turned back midway and landed in Xiamen to wait for the weather to improve before flying to Shanghai. The Portuguese Consulate in Shanghai received a telegram from the plane in Xiamen at 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon, stating roughly that coastal areas were still covered in heavy fog with no hope of improvement in the near future. The decision was made to end the flight to Shanghai and return to Hong Kong from Xiamen that day. Upon receiving the telegram, the consulate immediately notified the Portuguese residents in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Land Value Tax in Zhabei and Other Districts to be Levied Starting Next Month on the First</h3>
<p>Municipal Government Approves Plan</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Municipal Government, based on a report from the Finance Bureau, stated roughly that the first installment of the provisional land value tax for the 22nd year, which should be levied in the four districts of Zhabei (two, four, five, and six), and the four districts of Yangjing (two, three, five, and six); and the second installment of the provisional land value tax for the 23rd year, which should be levied in the three districts of Jiyinxiang (five, six, and eight), and one district of Pusong, is set to be levied starting on December 1st of this year. Collection will be limited to two months from the date of commencement, ending on January 31st of the 24th year. Those who fail to pay within the deadline will be pursued for payment in accordance with Article 8 of the Provisional Land Value Tax Regulations and Article 23 of the Implementing Rules, including adding annual interest to the amount owed, and extracting revenue from the land or auctioning it off as compensation based on the length of arrears, in order to comply with the tax revenue mandate. The Municipal Government has approved the plan.</p>
<h3>Rumor of Gu Mengyu's Serious Illness Said to Be Mistaken</h3>
<p>To Be Discharged from Noel Hospital Soon</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, reports indicated that Railway Minister Gu Mengyu was seriously ill in Shanghai. Yesterday morning, a reporter from the Central News Agency went to the Noel Hospital on Avenue Joffre, where Mr. Gu was recuperating, to inquire. According to the medical staff, Mr. Gu felt unwell after arriving in Shanghai from Nanjing and came to the hospital for treatment. Mrs. Gu also stayed in the hospital. Mr. Gu suffered from stomach problems but they have not relapsed. This hospitalization is for recuperation and he will be discharged soon. The report of a serious illness is a misrepresentation.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Exchange Rate Drops After Unloading, Shanghai Goods Transported to Sichuan</h3>
<p>Chongqing Market Active</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, Sichuan Province's finances were in turmoil and panic spread after Liu Xiang's resignation, leading to a surge in the Shanghai exchange rate, reaching a maximum of 1,680 yuan. The transport of goods and passengers to Sichuan was halted for almost two months due to excessive costs, which significantly affected the sales of domestic goods in the city. However, since Liu Xiang went to Nanjing to negotiate the issuance of public bonds and request the reorganization of Sichuan's finances, plans have been made for local finance. The Shanghai exchange rate has fallen rapidly from more than 1,300 yuan to 200 yuan at the border. Yesterday, the reporter visited Mr. Huang Mohan, the manager of the Juxingcheng Bank, to inquire about the reason for the fall in the Shanghai exchange rate. He said that in order to increase market capital and activity, the financial and commercial circles in Chongqing initiated the issuance of "public receipts" three years ago. This involved registering private real estate deeds or valuable securities with a treasury jointly established by money shops, which was responsible for management. Public receipts were issued based on the assessed value of the total amount applied for. The applicant could then use these public receipts in the market without having to move cash, similar to a bank's issuance of banknotes. However, the total amount issued in the past three years was 15 million yuan, of which the Sichuan authorities accounted for more than 9 million. As a result, most of the market activity was based on these public receipts. Some holders of public receipts, believing rumors, feared they would become worthless. This led to the sharp rise in the Shanghai exchange rate due to panic. It was then recognized that the issuance of public receipts had its drawbacks, and a unanimous decision was made to have the Sichuan authorities and merchants voluntarily withdraw them. Since the 15th of this month, public receipts have been uniformly rejected in the market. All payments, mortgages, and transactions are made in cash. Therefore, the Chongqing market has suddenly become active, and the people's sentiments are gradually stabilizing. The Shanghai exchange rate has fallen to around 1,180 yuan. The reporter also learned from various Sichuan guilds and customs brokers that they have taken advantage of the fall in the Shanghai exchange rate and the low-water season to purchase large quantities of foreign goods, including cotton yarn, coarse cloth, towels, enamelware, rubber shoes, electrical supplies, bakelite products, and thermos cups and pots. Many daily necessities were included as well. Domestic goods manufacturers in the city and shipping companies on the Sichuan River have indirectly benefited, and freight rates have recovered slightly. The freight rate for one bale of cotton yarn was previously reduced from 24 yuan to 4 yuan but has recently increased slightly. According to those who have recently arrived in Shanghai from Sichuan Province, the situation in Chongqing has improved, and all the goods previously purchased have been sold out. It is expected that after these Shanghai goods arrive in Sichuan, another large batch of domestic goods will soon be transported to Sichuan.</p>
<h3>American Dr. Stanton Studies Eastern History</h3>
<p>According to the Zi Lin Bao, Dr. Stanton of the United States has been in Shanghai for only three days and has already been able to find his way around the various sections of the concessions. Not only that, but he can also speak Chinese. Dr. Stanton has written a book about the opening of Shanghai. People may not believe this, but it is actually quite simple. Although Dr. Stanton has never been to China before, he has been studying Chinese issues in the United States for many years. He is a professor of Far Eastern history at the University of Michigan and specializes in the study of Eastern affairs in his spare time. He plans to spend a year in China, Japan, and Russia to explore history, with a focus on collecting materials on the origins of China at the National Library of Peking. Dr. Stanton is funded by the American Council of Learned Societies as a research fellow. He will spend most of his time investigating the history of Sino-Russian relations in the 17th and 18th centuries to understand its background and thoroughly understand the current situation in the Far East. According to Dr. Stanton, China's relationship with Russia is the most important thing in the world today. China's relationship with Western countries is less important than the current situation between China and Russia. The book that Dr. Stanton is about to complete is compiled from his doctoral dissertation, which was submitted to the University of California and approved by the committee. After six months of exploration in Peking, Dr. Stanton will go to Japan, then to Moscow, and then to England to investigate documents related to Far Eastern history in the Public Record Office, and finally return to the United States to resume his professorship in the fall. Dr. Stanton speaks to Chinese, Russians, French, Koreans, and Japanese in Shanghai without any difficulty. He says that he finds Chinese easier to read than to speak.</p>
<h3>National Federation of Commerce Asks the Central Government to Allow Old Stamps to Be Exchanged for New Stamps</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Commerce telegraphed the National Government's Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Industry yesterday, stating: "Recently, we received a telegram from the Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Commerce stating that at the joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members held by our association on the 21st of this month, the Suzhou County Chamber of Commerce proposed that, in order to respect the national tax stamp credibility, we should follow the Zhejiang Province's approach and notify everyone to continue to use old stamps as usual. The proposal was immediately discussed at the meeting and it was resolved that the registration process for old stamps is too complicated. We should request the central ministries and departments to promptly determine a deadline to allow merchants to exchange old stamps for new stamps directly at the local stamp sales offices, without the need for separate registration. We also request the National Federation of Commerce and the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce to unanimously advocate for this simplification. This resolution was unanimously passed and recorded. In addition to submitting another request to the central ministries and departments, we hereby telegraph your association to advocate unanimously and submit another request to the central ministries and departments. We would be extremely grateful." In view of this, we are hereby submitting a telegram to your government, requesting that you approve the direct exchange of old stamps for new stamps, without the need for separate registration, in order to simplify the process. This would be extremely beneficial. Respectfully, Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce, with seal.</p>

<h3>National Private Postal Industry Held Emergency Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Decision to Petition in Nanjing During Fifth Plenary Session</p>
<p>Termination Will Affect the Livelihoods of Ten Thousand People</p>
<p>The National Private Postal Industry, due to the National Government's order to cease operations by the end of this year, which will directly and indirectly affect the livelihoods of more than ten thousand people, held an emergency meeting yesterday at 4:00 PM, gathering more than 100 representatives from various ports at the Private Postal Industry Association on Li Xian Gua Street. A decision was made to send representatives to Nanjing to petition during the Fifth Plenary Session. The details were obtained by a reporter from the Hua Dong News Agency as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Representatives</p>
<p>Yue Xiechen (Nanjing), Zhang Shiyu (Zhenjiang), Chen Jieren (Yangzhou), Zeng Senchang and Yu Geshun (Sichuan), Liu Shousheng, Zhang Liansheng, Xu Shan, Chen Bangxian (Ningbo), Yin Yuantong and Hua Yunqing (Shanghai), Ying Chunyu, Shen Baifu, Li Bingquan, Shen Guoliang, Chen Kangning, Xu Ashun, Zhu Qingfu (Jiaxing), Wang Ziying and Qiu Zhensheng (Yantai), Ge Tianxiang (Xiamen), Huang Huinan, Dong Pinsen, Zhang Xiling, Fang Baoxiang, Fang Baokang, Wang Hengfu (Shantou), Ren Shiting (Suzhou), Wang Yongzeng (Wenzhou), Li Baosheng (Fuzhou), Wu Binggao, Wang Dabao, Yu Kedong, Zhuang Gengtang, Wang Zuhao, Zhang Guitang (Hangzhou), Fang Xianzhang (Datuan), Chen Shaozhong (Zhoupu), and more than 100 representatives from Wuhan, Chongqing, and other places, presided over by Yin Yuantong,</p>
<p>Results of Discussion</p>
<p>After lengthy discussions by the representatives, the following steps were decided: (1) The Fifth Plenary Session will be held on December 10th. A decision was made to send representatives to Nanjing to petition for an extension of the deadline. (2) If an extension is not granted, further measures will be taken. (3) If an extension cannot be obtained, the government is requested to provide relief for the livelihoods of more than 100,000 employees in the national private postal industry. (4) A petition will be submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and the Social Affairs Bureau within this week. (5) Another general membership meeting will be convened within this week.</p>
<p>Representatives Come to Shanghai</p>
<p>After the association decided to send representatives to Nanjing to petition at the Fifth Plenary Session during yesterday's emergency meeting, it immediately telegraphed members in various places to gather in Shanghai as soon as possible to petition at the Fifth Plenary Session. It is understood that the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and other related organizations also believe that the issue is serious and will hold meetings to discuss and decide on a plan for assistance, while also expressing their opinions on this matter.</p>
<p>Long History</p>
<p>According to Yin Yuantong and other attending representatives, they told a reporter from the Hua Dong News Agency that the private postal industry has been established in China for more than 120 years and has made significant contributions to Chinese culture. Before the establishment of the post office, letters in remote areas were delivered by private postal workers. Even in the first ten years after the establishment of the post office, private postal workers provided voluntary assistance. Even though transportation is now convenient, the private postal industry still relies on its past reputation to serve the cultural industry, and it is not just a business. According to the current situation, there are more than 100 private postal offices in Jiangsu, more than 140 in Zhejiang, more than 100 in the Yangtze River basin, more than 60 in Guangdong and Guangxi, more than 30 in Fujian, and a total of no less than 500 including Sichuan, Hong Kong, and other provinces and ports. More than 100,000 people directly and indirectly rely on it for their livelihoods. For the sake of maintaining credibility, we would never dare to violate the government's orders, but we hope that a proper relief plan can be devised for the livelihood issues of these private postal workers. Moreover, during this period, commercial exchanges in remote areas still rely on the private postal industry for communication. How will the authorities handle the aftermath?</p>
<h3>Autumn General Meeting of the Lawyers Association Adjourned Due to Lack of Quorum</h3>
<p>Reconvened in Three Weeks</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association convened its autumn general meeting yesterday (Sunday) at 2:00 PM at the Lake Society Assembly Hall at the intersection of Guizhou Road and Beijing Road in the Public Concession. The attending members included Shen Junru, Qu Yue, Chen Tingrui, Wang Weizhen, Wu Guotai, Shi Qinghua, Liu Xiang, Liu Mingdu, Zhou Shiying, Lu Shaozong, Jiang Yiping, Qin Liankui, Wang Xiaowen, Shan Yuhua, Hu Jue, Li Ming, Zhao Zuwei, Shi Liang, Gong Ying, Huang Zengjie, Huang Qiying, Chen Kuitang, Cha Renwei, Zhou Yu, Xiang Xun, Zhang Zhengxue, Zhang Xiongfei, Zhu Fojiu, Yan Yinwu, Wang Shulin, Xu Zuoliang, Yu Zufeng, and 145 others. Xing Wan from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Tang Ruxiu from the Local Court, and Guo Wei and other prosecutors from the First Special District Local Court attended to provide guidance and supervision. At 3:30 PM, the meeting was called to order by the presidium consisting of the three standing committee members, Shen Junru, Chen Tingrui, and Wang Weizhen. Chairman Shen reported that the association has a total of 1,120 members. According to the association's articles of association approved by the Ministry of Judicial Administration, the meeting requires a quorum of one-fourth of the members to be valid. The number of members present today is still insufficient to meet the quorum, so the meeting can only be changed to a discussion meeting. (At this time, the representatives from the Party Headquarters and the Local Court withdrew.) However, the association has a total of 654 members who are in arrears with their membership fees. According to the regulations, members who are in arrears for more than four months will be reported to the association for expulsion. If the members in arrears can be deducted, today's meeting can also be held. However, the expulsion procedures have not yet been completed. The attending members should discuss a proper method. Lu Shaozong, Qu Yue, Jiang Yiping, Wang Xiaowen, Zhang Xiongfei, Cha Renwei, Shan Yuhua, and other members stood up one after another to express their opinions. As a result, the meeting was postponed for three weeks, and all members who are in arrears with their membership fees were urged to pay their outstanding fees to the association within two weeks, otherwise they will be reported for expulsion according to the regulations. Other proposed motions, as the discussion meeting had no voting rights, were left for the next meeting to be brought up for discussion, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs to Regularly Dredge the New Waterway of the Huangpu River</h3>

<p>Notice to Shipowners</p>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, Gu Lien, the Harbour Master of Jianghai Customs, issued Bulletin No. 24 yesterday regarding the regular dredging of the new waterway of the Huangpu River, stating: "It has been determined that the Dredging Bureau's dredger Hai Long No. 2 will begin dredging a 300-foot-wide section of the harbor channel starting on December 1st of this year. Its location is between approximately 400 feet above the berthing buoy of section of the Dredging Bureau and approximately 800 feet above New Waterway Buoy No. 2. When ships pass through this area, they must reduce their speed along the Puxi side and pay attention to the width of the dredged harbor channel. When approaching the dredger, they must sound a long whistle so that the dredger has sufficient time to loosen its side anchors. All signals shall be handled in accordance with the usual berthing signals and lights listed in Announcement No. 10 of the Customs in the Republic of China Year 21. All maps relating to this dredging are displayed in the Harbour Affairs Section of the Customs and the Dredging Bureau for reference. All shipowners are hereby notified. This is hereby announced."</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance States that Silver Transport Requires a Passport</h3>
<p>A Long-Standing Regulation</p>
<p>This is Merely a Reiteration of Previous Orders</p>
<p>The person in charge of the Ministry of Finance's office in Shanghai stated to a reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency yesterday that the joint announcement issued by Tang Haian, the Superintendent of Jianghai Customs, and Mr. Bled, the Customs Commissioner, regarding the need for passports for the transport of silver dollars, was issued under the instructions of the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance. Banks transporting whole boxes or bags of silver coins domestically must have their passports verified by the Customs before they can be transported. Those who transport silver without a passport will be considered to be smuggling, and the goods will be confiscated according to regulations. It should be known that this measure is a long-standing regulation, and this is merely a reiteration of previous orders. Unexpectedly, some merchants mistakenly believe that the requirement to transport silver dollars with a passport is a new measure enacted after the imposition of the silver export tax and the equalization tax, which is a misrepresentation.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association Purchases Flour to Provide Relief to Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>Sends Letter to the Unified Tax Bureau Requesting Tax-Exempt Transport Permits</p>
<p>Also Sends Letters to All Sectors Urging Prompt Payment of Donations</p>
<p>The Jia Xu Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association, with the imminent arrival of winter, and the disaster victims urgently awaiting food, has purchased a large quantity of flour in preparation for distribution to the disaster areas. Yesterday, they sent a special letter to the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Unified Tax Bureau, requesting approval for the issuance of tax-exempt transport permits to facilitate relief efforts, and sent letters to all sectors, urging prompt payment of donations. The two letters are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Request for Issuance of Tax-Exempt Transport Permits</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Jia Xu Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association sent a letter to the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Unified Tax Bureau stating: "We are writing to inform you that our association has purchased 3,000 bags of No. 4 relief flour from the Nanjing Yangtze Flour Mill, 5,000 bags of No. 4 flour from the Changzhou Hengfeng Flour Mill, and 1,000 bags of No. 4 relief flour from the Shanghai Huafeng Flour Mill for transport to the disaster areas for distribution. In addition to submitting this flour to the Disaster Relief Committee for verification and forwarding to the Ministry of Finance for the issuance of a tax-exempt passport in accordance with Article 3 of the Measures for Tax Exemption on Relief Wheat Flour, we are now in urgent need of food for the disaster victims, and it is difficult to delay the matter. We are hereby submitting a letter of certification, earnestly requesting your bureau to issue tax-exempt transport permits in accordance with Article 7 of the same measures, and kindly instruct the resident officials of each factory to allow the tax-exempt delivery of the flour in advance.

Therefore, we earnestly request you to contribute early and urge the households you are representing to contribute (if you are in another city, please remit to the nearest branch of the Bank of China for collection). One day earlier for the collection of donations means that the disaster victims can survive earlier. Your kindness will be deeply appreciated. We are sending this letter to you and sincerely wish you well. Jointly, Chu Fucheng, Zhang Xuan, Wang Xiaolai, etc., Chairmen of the Jia Xu Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association.</p>
<h3>Serious Disaster in Li-huang County, Anhui - Urgent Telegram to Shanghai for Relief</h3>
<p>Victims Wander Helplessly, Crying for Food</p>
<p>Begging Benevolent Gentlemen to Save the Remnants of Our People</p>
<p>The Shanghai Fundraising Association for Drought Relief in Various Provinces yesterday received a telegram from Li-huang County, Anhui, requesting relief. We hereby transcribe it as follows (abbreviated salutations): We believe that there is no good governance to prevent drought, but giving food and clothing demonstrates compassion. We are all brothers and sisters, and feeling the hunger and suffering of others is true humanity. However, in Li-huang County, a great catastrophe has struck for years. A severe drought has lasted for months. Initially, the Red Disaster swept through, with "red flowers" (likely referring to Communist activities) covering the land. Fields and gardens were ruined, and houses were reduced to ruins. When there was water, people supported each other with their flesh and blood. In earth cellars, corpses formed mounds. Then, the few surviving orphans cried for food, wandering along the roads. We are deeply saddened. Hunger and cold have led to exhaustion, and epidemics are spreading. People are groaning in agony and death is imminent. In addition, the drought demon (旱魃) is wreaking havoc, and famine is occurring repeatedly. The crops have withered, and even the wild grains are dying. Even if we present Zheng Xia's drought map (鄭俠之圖), we still lack Chunren's wheat (純仁之麥, referring to a virtuous official who relieved famine). When the provincial committee inspected the disaster, the withered seedlings received rain, and there was still hope for some green shoots. However, the weather then became erratic, with alternating cold and heat. Pests multiplied secretly, and wind and frost raged肆虐. The green shoots that were previously visible have now turned into black husks. Statistics show that the harvest is no more than one-tenth of normal. Before the rice can be harvested, the grass rots. Before the beans can be harvested, people are crying from hunger. Moreover, bandits are rampant, and large armies are gathering. People have been fleeing from bandits for seven years and have endured five years of sieges. After the great catastrophe, a strange famine followed. In the year of the strange famine, the catastrophe increased again. According to records, in recent years, Li-huang has been filled with thorns, sparsely populated, with jackals and tigers forming packs, wild boars forming groups, malaria spreading, and weapons clashing. The old and sick are still forced to provide labor, and women sell firewood to survive. Their suffering is immense. Currently, various provinces are suffering from drought, and this county is not the only one affected. However, the people of other counties still have houses to live in and fields to cultivate. Only the people of Li-huang who have been affected by the drought have nowhere to return and no way to go. They cannot find a place to live, and they cannot cultivate the land. Some live as refugees and are driven away, while others seek rice but encounter high prices. They weep in the streets, trapped in a dilemma. Some even have their livelihoods cut off and entire families commit suicide by hanging. Therefore, in terms of disasters, Li-huang County is truly a unique disaster that has never been seen before. In terms of drought, the people of Li-huang County are suffering from the greatest drought in all provinces. Alas, our people, how cruel is this! We rely on the benevolent gentlemen of your association to save the remnants of our people. We also hope that you will speak with earnestness and compassion and appeal widely. Then, Li-huang will be fortunate, and the disaster victims will be fortunate. (The following is omitted.)</p>
<h3>Manufacturers Participate in the Changzhou National Products Exhibition</h3>
<p>Registration Office Relocated</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Promotion Association, through the initiative of Lin Junbao and Chen Yongcheng of the Wujin County Chamber of Commerce, organized the Changzhou National Products Exhibition and requested the association to lead Shanghai manufacturers to participate in the exhibition. The association, with the responsibility of promoting national products, approved the notification to various manufacturers. Since the start of registration, there has been a large number of participants because the booth fees are low, the procedures are simple, and there are no miscellaneous fees. However, there are not many booth spaces, and restrictions are strict. Those who came later expressed regret at missing the opportunity. As a result, the association's affairs became complex, and the original location was not sufficient for office work. The office has now been relocated to 90932, Xiqi Pan Street, Henan Road West (behind Chun Geng Li), and will continue to operate as usual.</p>
<h3>Shanghai County District Security Joint Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government was ordered to implement the Baojia (保甲) system throughout the county, which was implemented on the first of this month. The first phase of the pilot township census period ended on the 15th. The second phase of work is now being carried out, with the census of other townships to be completed before December 15th. Yesterday, the County Government specifically convened a joint meeting of district chiefs and district census committees, chaired by County Magistrate Pan Zhongjia. After the meeting opened, the chairman first gave a report, followed by a discussion of various cases: (1) When should the salary of each census committee member be paid? It was decided that payments would begin on November 1st. (2) The previously determined Baojia expenses were eight yuan per town and six yuan per township, with the number of households used as a standard. Since some townships had more households than towns, the previous regulations seemed unfair. Should the township and town offices be paid a uniform six yuan per month? It was decided that townships and towns with more than 800 households would receive eight yuan per month, while those with fewer than 800 households would receive six yuan uniformly. (3) The first district chief proposed that the district offices in this county were previously budgeted at the third-class level across the board in the last meeting, making distribution difficult. It was decided that the first, second, and third districts would be reclassified as second-class, while the fourth and fifth districts would remain third-class. The county will prepare a budget and submit it for approval. (4) Discussion of various issues related to the progress of the Baojia census: (A) In the joint security pledges, household heads often do not have a seal and are unwilling to affix a fingerprint. It was decided that if there is no seal, the person must affix a fingerprint; otherwise, it will be invalid. (B) Residents have been found to tear down their house numbers without authorization. It was decided that residents should be warned to properly preserve their house numbers. If found to be torn down, the government and the local public security bureau should be immediately notified for punishment.</p>
<h3>Shanghai National Products Manufacturers Organize National Products Industry and Commerce Association</h3>
<p>Unite Strengths to Resist Foreign Goods</p>
<p>Since the world economic panic and the devaluation of foreign goods led to dumping, our country's market has been monopolized by foreign goods. The annual leakage of capital is unknown, which has a significant impact on the national economy and people's livelihood. Major national product manufacturers in this city, in order to unite their strengths and resist foreign goods, have initiated the organization of the China National Products Industry and Commerce Association, led by the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory, Zhonghua Knitting Factory, Yonghe Industrial Company, Zhenyi National Products Store, Baokang National Products Store, Hongxing Sock Factory, Huafeng Hat Factory, Dade Rubber Factory, Jixing Chemical Industrial Company, Shuanglun Toothbrush Factory, and others.

<h3>National Economic Commission Selects Technical Personnel</h3>
<p>One Year of Internship After Acceptance</p>
<p>Sent Abroad to Investigate the Tea Industry</p>
<p>The Agricultural Department of the National Economic Commission, in view of the increasing decline of China's tea industry in recent years, which has led to the failure of tea merchants to develop their businesses and has greatly affected tax revenue, intends to select tea technology personnel to travel to India, Ceylon, Japan, and the Nanyang Islands, Java, and other tea-producing areas to conduct on-site investigations to learn from them. The main subjects are: (1) Tea selection and cultivation; (2) Tea production and grading; (3) Tea packaging and sales. The Agricultural Department has sent letters to various schools to select candidates who have graduated from agricultural colleges at home and abroad, have engaged in practical work or research for more than two years, or have graduated from agricultural vocational schools at home and abroad, have engaged in practical work for more than five years, and must have a special interest in tea and be proficient in English. The deadline for registration is the end of this month. After acceptance, there will be one year of internship. It is reported that the commission has organized a review committee, hiring Qian Tianhe, director of the Agricultural Experiment Station, Zou Meiwen, dean of the Jinling University Agricultural College, Yang Chengxun, technician of the Economic Commission, Xu Shilian, deputy director of the commission, and the dean of the Central University Agricultural College as review committee members. Many people have been registering in recent days.</p>
<h3>Joint Punishment for Carrying and Snatching Opium</h3>
<p>Zhang A'gen, a native of Changzhou, lived at a certain address on Mengjiangtang, Wusong Road. At 11:10 AM the day before yesterday, he was carrying two taels of opium. While passing near Bazilu and Zhapulu, he was spotted by the rogue Jiangbei native Pan A'yuan, who stopped Zhang and forced him to take out the opium, or else he would report him to the Yuan (袁, likely meaning police). Zhang was only willing to split the opium in half, but Pan refused. They argued with each other and were caught by Chinese detectives Huang Guangqi, number 177 and 228. After learning the truth, they arrested Zhang and Pan, along with the opium, and brought them to the Hongkou Police Station. They reported to the chief, who ordered them to be detained. The next morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The lawyer of the Bureau of Public Works, Li Zhishan, presented the facts and presented the opium for inspection. Judge Wu Zehan questioned the two defendants and clarified the situation. He sentenced Zhang A'gen to a fine of 40 yuan and Pan A'yuan to 40 days of detention. The opium was confiscated.</p>

<h3>Joint Embargo on Gasoline Shipments by Britain, America, and Russia</h3>
<p>Countering Japan's Control of Gasoline in Manchuria</p>
<p>According to Osaka Mainichi Shimbun, due to the issue of Japan's control of gasoline in Manchuria, Britain and America have been greatly impacted. Now, various countries are standing on a united front to deal with Japan. The American-owned Texaco and the British-owned Asiatic Petroleum Company in Shanghai have agreed to stop supplying gasoline to Manchuria, intending to no longer ship gasoline and kerosene to Manchuria as a countermeasure. The Shanghai branches have received instructions from their respective countries. At the same time, they have invited the Russian-owned gasoline company to participate. If the three countries jointly stop supplying gasoline, Manchuria will inevitably experience a major gasoline panic. It is heard that this opposition action is about to materialize, and the future ripples are difficult to predict.</p>

<h3>Recent News on the Knitting Exhibition Sponsored by the Family Industrial Society</h3>
<p>The Family Industrial Society, in order to unite the industry and seek common development, is holding a National Products Treasure Collection at the Invincible Brand Distributor on Nanjing Road. All national products industries are welcome to participate. The first phase of the National Products Cosmetics Industry Exhibition closed last month with excellent results and was highly praised by society.

There are no fewer than several thousand kinds of exhibits. Since its opening, the number of visitors has been extremely crowded. Details have been reported in various newspapers. The exhibition was originally scheduled for 20 days and will close on the 26th of this month. However, due to the repeated requests of various parties to continue the exhibition for the convenience of purchasing and to cultivate the habit of using national products among the Chinese people, the association, feeling that the kindness was appreciated and difficult to refuse, decided to extend the exhibition for ten days to satisfy the popular desire. In addition to each factory selecting various high-quality products for price reduction, such as Fanlong Factory's suede gloves, specially priced at one yuan per pair, Sanlian Factory's pure silk women's socks, one yuan per pair, buy one get one free, double-thread men's socks, five pairs for only 85 cents, double-thread women's socks, six pairs for one yuan, Rancheng Factory's open-back four-meter men's and women's socks, 90 cents per pair, buy one get one free, rubber hot water bottle, one yuan 25 cents each, buy one get one free.

Their enthusiasm is commendable. It is heard that many national products industries have been requesting regulations from the association to plan and hold exhibitions.</p>
<h3>The City Public Security Bureau Sends Personnel to Reorganize the Jiangwan Fire Brigade</h3>
<p>Corrupt Content Found to Be True</p>
<p>Zhao Genxiang and Others Have Been Ordered to Be Investigated</p>
<p>More than 30 businesses, including Jiangwan Town's Anji Hongji Pawnshop, Shunchang Clothing Store, Qingchang Tea Shop, and Zhou Boji Bamboo Shop, jointly accused the Jiangwan District Fire Brigade's content of being corrupt, inconsistent with public opinion, and colluding with local ruffians to extort money from the Xianshui Temple. The original presentation is recorded as follows: "Presenting that the Jiangwan District Fire Brigade's content is corrupt, inconsistent with public opinion, requesting prompt rectification to maintain fire administration. We have investigated that the fire brigade in this district has become increasingly corrupt since the re-election after the January 28th Incident. The Bureau has repeatedly ordered reprimands in the case. However, since last year, the association's affairs have become more and more scattered, and illegal incidents have occurred frequently. Among the larger ones, such as forcibly borrowing money from Anji Pawnshop and unreasonably assaulting the staff of the China Public Automobile, etc., have long been talked about on the streets and alleys, and are expected to be known to the Bureau. The responsible personnel of the association evaded each other, and all the power fell into the hands of a so-called security department. The electric lights are bright at night, like daytime, but when the police are on alert, they are flustered and panicked, letting the fire burn. The magnificent association is equal to an entertainment venue, and the magnificent costumes are regarded as the amulet of the tiger talisman. Holding scorpion and drinking wine, they do not hesitate to drive to the Lianxi River (on October 14th and 17th, the team leader led the team members to drive the fire truck to Jiading to buy crabs), spitting fog and swallowing clouds, it does not matter to lie high on the banks of Qujiang (team leader Zhao Genxiang, driver Li Jia Zeng, are both blacklisted). The foul voice overflows, and public opinion is boiling. Recently, they colluded with local ruffians and went to the Xianshui Temple in Baiyang Township to extort money. Tea houses and taverns use it as a topic of conversation. We think that the fire brigade is one of the local autonomous undertakings. The people use their hard-earned money to help each other for the sake of self-defense. Now, the useful money is used for the enjoyment of a few people. Is this the Bureau's idea of attaching importance to fire protection? We specially submit this document to the Bureau for inspection and rectification to attach importance to fire administration. The place is fortunate. (The following is omitted.) After receiving the presentation, the City Public Security Bureau ordered Hong Qi, the second section chief of the bureau, to send personnel to investigate and find that the content of the association was corrupt and that it was true. It was reorganized after the re-election last winter, and Liu Daokui, Wang Wujun, and others were promoted to be executive members responsible for the reorganization. However, it has only been less than a year, and it is so chaotic again. Only a thorough reorganization is enough to maintain the association's affairs. Chang ordered Cai Xiangshen, Zhong Yibo, Wu Ziwen, Gu Shanzhang, Wu Chuiying, Diao Qingen, Zhang Yuansheng, and others from Jiangwan to be the reorganization committee, and ordered Diao to be the chairman, and limited the reorganization to be completed within two months. As for the two names, Zhao Genxiang, the team leader, and Li Jia Zeng, the driver, who were accused of smoking opium, they were to be ordered to send the team leader to the bureau for investigation. If it is true, they should be severely punished according to the law.</p>
<h3>Yuanyuan Farm's Fourth Cow Shed Completed Yesterday</h3>
<p>Occupies Hundreds of Acres and Houses 400 Cows</p>
<p>Many People from All Walks of Life in Shanghai Visited</p>
<p>Yuanyuan Farm is the largest sterilized milk farm run by Chinese people. Its purpose is to reduce milk prices and improve Chinese cattle breeds. It has also recently produced canned milk for sale in the mainland, not only providing the opportunity for poor families to drink milk but also recovering the country's loss of rights and interests (the import of foreign canned milk in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces is more than 2 million per year, and the number must be alarming when combined with the whole country). It has only been in operation for two years, and it has raised more than 400 dairy cows. The head farm is located on Daxilu, covering an area of more than 20 acres. All the equipment is very modern. The recently completed fourth cow shed can accommodate 120 more dairy cows. There are also branch farms in Lincoln Road and Benniu Town, Changzhou, occupying hundreds of acres for raising calves and experimenting with improved cattle breeds. The capital is nearly 600,000 yuan. The rapid progress of its achievements is truly good news for the future of the business community. Yesterday (25th) was the day of the completion of the farm's fourth cow shed. Letters were sent to various circles inviting them to visit. Important people from Beijing and Shanghai sent congratulatory messages, such as President Yu Youren of the Control Yuan, who presented "Utilizing and Enriching Life," Minister of Industry Zhang Gongbo, who presented "Pioneering the Way for Agriculture," Central Committee member Wang Luyi, who presented "Caring for the Masses," Control Yuan member Yan Zhuang, who presented "Many Who Give Life," and other celebrities in Shanghai. The congratulatory messages were dazzling and beautiful. The weather was harmonious that day, and it was also Sunday. Guests came to visit in an endless stream. Celebrities in Shanghai, such as Wu Yunzhai, Ma Shiru, Bai Hongji, Tang Bowen, Xu Tingzu, Zhao Guide, Huang Ainong, Chen Xiaosun, Song Yuanhui, Yin Jichang, Shen Hezu, Xu Songnian, Li Yaxi, and Zheng Zhongwu, all personally participated in the completion ceremony. Miss Pei Mona performed the ribbon-cutting ceremony, and tea and refreshments were served to the guests at the same time. The farm's staff provided diligent hospitality. The traffic on Daxilu was busy at one time, making it a grand event.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Upon reading the news item "Playing with Electrical Wires Leads to Death" in your esteemed newspaper's news column, I was greatly surprised and dismayed. The circumstances described therein do not match the facts. Mao Lingen worked at the Kang Kee Running Shoe Factory. On the afternoon of the 23rd, at approximately 3:00 PM, Wei Kang Kee, in gratitude to En Yun, instructed Lingen to install temporary electric lights in the partnership lace company opened by Zhao Xie Ting (mistakenly written as Cao Amao). Because Lingen had no knowledge of electricity, he was electrocuted to death. I am writing to request that this be corrected in the corrections column of your newspaper. Please accept this request, Editor.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Mao Yousan, the relative involved</p>

<h3>Land Dispute Near Ni Cheng Bridge Involving More Than Nine Fen Has Lasted for Thirty Years</h3>
<p>Families of Both Parties Continue Litigation After Original Parties' Deaths</p>
<p>Supreme Court Appeal Returned for Retrial Before Final Decision</p>
<p>A Page in the History of Shanghai Real Estate</p>
<p>During the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China, Shanghai residents Zheng Huahua and Jin Xiaoyun were involved in a dispute over a plot of land measuring nine fen and nine li and six hao near Ni Cheng Bridge. The case was litigated in the former Mixed Court. Although the court repeatedly heard and judged the case, it ultimately failed to satisfy either party. Because there was no appeals body within the concession at the time, the case remained unresolved even after the court was abolished. Therefore, in 1927, when an appeals court was established in the concession, one of the dissatisfied parties (Zheng Huahua) filed an appeal seeking redress. The court then summoned the case file and, without review, dismissed the appeal because Zheng had not stated his intention to reserve the right to appeal when the Mixed Court pronounced its judgment, which was inconsistent with the terms of the agreement. When the Appeals Court was reorganized into the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court, Zheng Huahua and Jin Xiaoyun had both passed away. Then, Zheng Huahua's wife, Zheng Wu, aged 67, filed a retrial appeal with the Second Branch of the Higher Court against Jin Xiaoyun's descendant, Jin Fenggang, claiming that after the former Mixed Court's judgment, her husband had submitted a petition to the Shanghai Circuit Intendant's Office, and there was a draft of the petition to prove it, which should be recognized as evidence of reserving the right to appeal, which was not contrary to the agreement. Jin Fenggang, on the other hand, hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to argue that Zheng Wu was not a litigant and was being exploited, which was also contrary to the law, requesting that the appeal be dismissed. In the autumn of the year before last, the Second Branch of the Higher Court summoned both parties for questioning and ruled against Zheng Wu. The latter remained dissatisfied and appealed to the Supreme Court, requesting the abolition of the original judgment and the execution of the Mixed Court's judgment of November 17, 1913, ordering Jin to repay the land price and rent or to return the original land. Recently, the Supreme Court completed its review and found that the previous judgment was not entirely satisfactory, and returned the case to the Second Branch of the Higher Court for retrial. Presiding Judge Li Minting, together with assessors Han and Ni, held a hearing the other day. Jin Fenggang again hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to represent him, based on his previous arguments and citing previous judgments and precedents of the Dali Court, demanding that the original judgment be upheld and the plaintiff's claim be dismissed. Presiding Judge Li announced the main text of the judgment yesterday, stating that the appeal was dismissed, and the costs of the second instance and the previous second instance litigation were to be borne by the appellant. The reasons stated in the judgment were particularly detailed, generally stating that the court had investigated the case file transferred from the former Mixed Court and found that there was no service certificate to be found. It could not be accurately determined on what date the Mixed Court's judgment of August 4, 1921, was served on the appellant. However, according to the Litigation Law of the Mixed Court and the Tang Yu applied by the Mixed Court, the judgment took effect immediately after it was read out and there was no requirement for it to be served. The winning creditor could also request the Mixed Court to enforce it. Moreover, the investigation revealed that the appellant's late husband, Zheng Huahua, had submitted a petition for review within seven days of the pronouncement of the original judgment on August 11, 1921, detailing the points that should be amended in the original judgment. It was evident that he had already received the judgment. Since the appellant did not state that she reserved the right to appeal, the judgment of August 4, 1921, should be considered final and should not be overturned on any pretext. It is reported that this case has been litigated for nearly thirty years, making it the longest-running case in the First Special District Court. After this judgment, it is hoped that litigation will not continue.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Chen Yunsu)</p>
<p>Some say that the reason why Chinese people are always complaining about poverty is entirely because intellectuals stubbornly cling to a long gown, unwilling to easily discard it, resulting in them being neither scholars nor soldiers.</p>
<p>Chinese people have always felt a special interest in the word "old," so everywhere "young bodies with old heads" are cultivated. The great China is sent to the grave day by day.</p>
<h3>Guan Gong Crab</h3>
<p>— Shijiu</p>
<p>Among crabs, the most famous, in terms of lake crabs, must be the Yangcheng Lake crab of Jiangsu. Yellow claws, golden hair, and iron-red pincers, with a "公" (public) character deeply engraved on its back - these are the characteristics of the Yangcheng Lake crab. Other lake crabs cannot compare. As for sea crabs, the variety is countless.</p>
<p>On the beaches of the coast, after the tide recedes, one often sees poor children carrying baskets in their hands, their feet sinking into the mud, catching sea crabs in twos and threes. Those crabs also crawl out of the mud from time to time, as if they have been imprisoned for a long time and want to see the light of day. But they are also quite alert, and at the slightest sound, they "whoosh" and retreat into the mud, causing the poor children to pounce in vain.</p>
<p>Speaking of sea crabs, their sizes vary greatly, and their shapes are also different, so there are many names, mostly named according to their shape. For example, there is a kind of small sea crab with a square head, so everyone calls it "coffin head," which is very jarring! Among them, the most refined is the Guan Gong crab.</p>
<p>The Guan Gong crab is roughly similar to the commonly seen lake crab, but it is smaller. The claws are slightly longer, the body is slightly flatter, and the back is oval. It can also be eaten, but it is not very fatty, and it does not have much fresh flavor. After cooking, its back is completely red, with clear features. The two silkworm eyebrows are slightly upturned, and the pair of phoenix eyes are bright and spirited. The cheekbones are slightly prominent, and the positions of the mouth and nose are very proportionate, only lacking a few strands of a beautiful beard. Looking closely at the entire crab back, it can be said that it is identical to the statue of Guan Zhuangmu that is commonly circulated. The craftsmanship of creation is truly incredible!</p>
<p>If you use the crab shell as the head, and attach it to clay to form a half-body, and place it on the table, it becomes a small statue of Guan Gong. I have played with this, and it seems much more interesting than sticking the crab claws on the wall to make a butterfly. So I think this kind of sea crab being called "Guan Gong" is the most accurate.</p>
<h3>Qu Jin Ma Jia (Curved-Front Vest)</h3>
<p>— Xu Haowu</p>
<p>During joking and teasing among friends, the curved-front vest, like the crown representing the emperor in English idioms, has become a part representing the whole. The person who likes to wear a curved-front vest has gradually had his real name obscured by the four characters "curved-front vest."</p>
<p>"Curved-Front Vest" is not good-looking, has a lame foot, and does not know many characters. Ordinary correspondence is all done by others.</p>
<p>But nature creates all things, and what is lacking in this may be excelled in that. "Curved-Front Vest" is humorous, eloquent, and good at observing the atmosphere. When the surrounding air is tense, as long as a gentle breeze carries the "Curved-Front Vest's" "clever warbling," like a sharp, long, gold-knocking laugh following closely behind, the serious atmosphere will immediately ease.</p>
<p>With such a mouth, a vocal cord, plus a pair of sharp eyes, and a cunning mind, "Curved-Front Vest" has been unemployed for more than ten years, but still "tea comes to his hand, food comes to his mouth." He is drunk and confused every day.</p>
<p>Once, "Curved-Front Vest" secretly took his wife's little savings from before and gave them to a good-natured friend on the condition that he would repay them independently by a certain date, and asked him to come forward and scheme.</p>
<p>After calculating the vague "future," "Curved-Front Vest" does not forget to grasp the meaningful "present." He socializes, he perfunctorily performs; he uses entertaining guests as a pretext, spends no money himself, opens rooms all day, eats elaborate dishes, indulges in food and drink, and enjoys himself heartily for quite a while.</p>
<p>Mechanism is a snobbish dog. If "Curved-Front Vest" prides himself on being aloof, does not manipulate, does not ingratiate himself; is not cunning, not vicious. Then all that is left for his family is the northwest wind, just waiting for him to go back and drink it!</p>

<h3>"Kill Half Price"</h3>
<p>— Binxi</p>
<p>There is such a saying, "Suzhou people, kill half price!" In terms of buying and selling, Suzhou people are used to bargaining, and the reason for this is because the seller "asks for empty head," so the buyer "kills half price" with all his might!</p>
<p>In Suzhou, there are many peddlers, commonly known as "carrying poles," who carry things like lotus seeds, pond lotus roots, Chinese yams, lily bulbs, and so on, and sell them along the way. Because the price of pond lotus roots, Chinese yams, and the like is not fixed, they raise it particularly high. On the buying side, because they think it is not a daily necessity, they deliberately bargain. In this bargaining process, both sides have to compromise in order to make a deal. It is not to say that fresh lotus roots costing two hundred wen per catty are always sold by Suzhou people for one hundred wen per catty. What I know about "kill half price" is probably about this!</p>
<p>As for shops, there is no price fluctuation, let alone bargaining. As far as I know, many shops still have a uniform price.</p>
<p>If you don't believe me, go to Caizhi Zhai to buy melon seeds. If you follow the "kill half price" rule, melon seeds that cost one yuan for four cans would then cost half a yuan for four cans. If you really "kill half price" like this, the clerk will at least give you the nickname "die crookedly" in secret! That is, if he doesn't dare to offend you to your face!</p>
<h3>Xiao Xitian (Little Western Paradise)</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 5: Flattering Smiles Meet, Lantern Light Illuminates Weariness, Hungry Stomach Drives, Powdered Face Learns Style</p>
<p>There seemed to be some redness on his face. Just looking at him lowering his eyelids, one could imagine that there was a real difficulty in discussing the issue of age. But at this time, the sun sank below the horizon, and the room was a bit dark, and everyone's faces were not clear. This Miss Yang Jia also borrowed this newly arrived darkness to cover up her shyness. In the midst of her embarrassment, there was probably two or three minutes of hesitation. How long ago had Li Shilian asked if she was eighteen years old? She only hummed softly, which was regarded as answering "yes." Everything was silent in the room. Everyone was smoking or drinking tea. No one mentioned Miss Yang. Li Shilian said: Tea house, we can't see anything in the room. Aren't you going to send us a light? The tea house had already prepared the lights, but couldn't figure out what was going on with this woman, and stood outside the door, listening to everything. He thought to himself, will such a woman be a miss? When the train reaches Xi'an in the future, there will probably be even more new things than this. At this time, hearing someone calling inside, he brought in a tall, glass kerosene lamp. Of course, the lamp was placed on the table, and Yang Huanhua sat down next to the side of the table. The kerosene lamp, with a flame the size of a broad bean, slantedly reflected half of her face, making the thin, un-powdered skin appear even more lined with faint goose-bump wrinkles. When she smiled, both rows of teeth were exposed. Needless to say, this part was old. Jia Duocai thought to himself, such a woman, in Shanghai, even if she entered the wild chicken team, would be eliminated. Why does Lao Li think so highly of her, and specially introduce her to meet? Thinking in his heart, he naturally kept looking at her, sizing her up. (73)</p>
<h3>Royal Fragrance Drifting Records</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Considering it this way, how many ghosts should there be in the palace? Numerically speaking, there should be more ghosts in the palace in Beijing than in the palace in Shengjing, but the palace in Beijing is inhabited all year round, and there are enough people, so the ghosts dare not appear; or it can be said that those ghosts are used to being disturbed all year round, so people and ghosts live together, and there is no unease. But this place has not been inhabited for thousands of years! - Although there are people left to guard it, there are too few. - These ghosts have lived safely for a long time, and suddenly so many people have come, how can they not be annoyed and resentful? We keep seeing this place as our old home, but in their minds, we must be a group of detestable foreigners; so they will definitely be furious and rush out to give us a considerable threat.</p>
<p>In fact, these are all the effects of nervous sensitivity, how could there really be any ghosts, but I have no power to eliminate them, I can only let them wreak havoc, gradually surrounding my whole mind together; even when those eunuchs are walking in the outer courtyard, the dim light reflects their figures, I will also regard them as the shadows of ghosts, and immediately add a few points of terror. These situations are very ridiculous to say, but at that time, being in that situation, there was really some difficulty in knowing that it was not worth being afraid but preferring to be afraid. The reason for this is very complicated, but after careful analysis, most of it is because the scenery in these palaces is too special and too unfamiliar. No matter how clean they have been cleaned and arranged by those eunuchs who were sent ahead and how similar they are to the palaces in Beijing, human power is limited, and material can be transformed, but spirit cannot be transformed. (183)</p>
<h3>New Invention</h3>
<p>— (Bing Yu)</p>
<p>Wonderful Medicine of Eggs</p>
<p>Eggs were originally a nourishing food for humans, and can also be used as raw materials for chemical materials, but their use as medicinal materials is still unknown to society. Recently, scholars analyzed the yolk of eggs and found that it contains 21.30 to 22.84% fat. This fat contains substances such as Allen, Palmidin, and Sterlin. If you want to extract fat from the yolk, you can put the yolk in an iron pot, heat it and stir it. The yolk will become charred and carbonized, and then squeezed to extract the fat. Store the fat in a bottle, and it will not spoil even after a long time. It can be kept in the home as a medicine. The special effects of this fat oil are as follows for the indicated diseases: (1) To treat pneumonia, put the roasted oil in capsules and swallow one capsule after each meal. It can eliminate the toxins of pneumonia and strengthen the heart and lungs. (2) For heart disease, if you have simple heart disease, take three capsules daily as above, and it is very effective. People who are newly afflicted with angina pectoris can be cured after taking it for one or two days. People with cardiac beriberi can be cured after taking it for a week. (3) For tuberculous hemorrhoids and other various internal and external hemorrhoids, the effect is particularly miraculous. (4) For those who are physically weak and have inaccurate vision, taking it can restore vision and increase energy. (5) For burns and various external injuries, apply this fat oil, and its effect is miraculous. (6) For mental fatigue, taking this oil for a long time can prolong life. This is the actual test of Matsukawa Kiyoshi, a famous figure in the Japanese chicken farming industry.</p>
<p>Wonderful Medicine of Onions</p>
<p>Recently, Russia has been using rotten onion heads near North Manchuria to manufacture poisonous gas. If you inhale this gas, you will shed tears and sneeze, which has caused a worldwide shock among military ordnance scholars. However, during the time of Columbus, some people used onion heads to make gunpowder. Since the Russian invention, scholars from various countries have been vying to study it, and it has now been confirmed to be true. If we observe when we usually cut onions with a knife, because the onion contains volatile oil, if this oil rushes into the eyes, it will cause tears, because the blood membrane cells in the eyes are stimulated by the oil. Now, if we carefully analyze the nature of this oil, it does contain poisonous gas. The oil contains a kind of "Xi Ang" hydrocyanic acid. Hydrocyanic acid is very poisonous. We get poisoned from eating green plums because of the effect of hydrocyanic acid. The potassium cyanide used in photography is also a poison. Foreigners compare harmful beauties to hydrocyanic acid. The "Xi Ang" compound contained in onions is sulfur cyanide hydrogen. Sulfur cyanide yalic, so it is proven that the "Xi Ang" compound in onions, when decomposed by chemical methods, does contain the quality that can be used as poisonous gas. Therefore, we should not eat rotten onions in the kitchen.</p>
<p>Non-Intoxicating Beer</p>
<p>Recently, Germany has invented a kind of "non-intoxicating beer". Even if you drink a thousand cups, you will not get drunk. This is because Germans are accustomed to drinking and often cause all kinds of trouble because of drunkenness. Yao Hanma Er, a chemist in Berlin, and a brewer, after various painstaking studies, added a special method to the brewing raw materials to prevent the raw materials from fermenting. The alcohol contained in this beer is only 0.35%, and the nature of this alcohol is different from ordinary stimulating alcohol, so even if you drink a thousand cups, you will not get drunk.</p>
<p>New Medicine for Drought Prevention</p>
<p>The British people are more advanced than other European countries in improving heavy industry and agriculture. Practical and beneficial inventions are continuously discovered in factories, shops, and neighborhoods, which increasingly improve modern life. Recently, the most noteworthy invention is Contald, which uses the latest Process—Passing Method—to make excellent, strong artificial silk, and the cost is very low, so it has won general praise from the society. The second is a new medicine to prevent drought, that is, scholars at the Philips Chemical Research Institute have discovered that there is a special sediment in the seabed of the deep sea that can be used as rain to prevent drought. Among them, the mechanical device of Hodison using the power of sea waves has been used by the British industrial world. Now that the UK is surrounded by sea, if this special seabed sediment is installed on the machine and sent to the air, it can make the sky cloudy and turn into heavy rain. This new invention is not a small blessing to the world. As for how to install it and how to make the seabed sediment undergo a chemical reaction and turn into heavy rain, there has not yet been an official and detailed publication, but it will probably be made public soon.</p>

<h3>The Yi Garden Is Packed with 12,000 Fans Watching Tung Wah Thoroughly Defeat Innis</h3>
<p>Innis' Goalkeeper Is Good, But Innis Still Gets a Duck Egg</p>
<p>Six Wins in Six Matches, Tung Wah Is Confident in the First Division</p>
<p>Smeaton and Chow Yin-yin Are Comparable</p>
<p>The British Army Innis Football Team, after arriving in Shanghai, made its first public appearance yesterday at Yi Garden, playing against the Chinese champion Tung Wah in a Western League First Division match. Before the game, due to vague reports and promotions in the Western press, rumors spread that Innis' strength would surpass that of the Wasters. Whether this was true or not became a mystery for a time. As a result, general fans, both male and female, Chinese and foreign, wanted to dispel this doubt and see what would happen. They raced to get there, fearing they would miss out, packing Yi Garden so tightly that water could not flow through it, setting an unprecedented record, with the number of attendees reaching over 12,000. In the end, disappointment and jubilation arrived simultaneously. Those disappointed found that Innis' skills were not amazing and did not surpass the Wasters. Those jubilant saw Tung Wah thoroughly defeat the British army by a huge score of four to zero, leaving Innis with a duck egg to take home. From then on, Tung Wah moved forward in the First Division with great momentum, aiming for the championship. Their only formidable opponent was the Western Catch-Ears. The outstanding performance of Innis' goalkeeper yesterday was a noteworthy event. At the same time, Yu You's victory over the Western Merchants by five to two in the Shen Garden was also a delightful event.</p>
<p>From Now On, Tung Wah Commands the Top Spot</p>

<p>The Truth About the Strength of the British Army Is Revealed</p>
<p>What was the true nature of Innis' skills and strength? Yesterday's match revealed it to the world. As a team, they are merely a mid-to-upper-level team. Their attack is inferior to their defense, and their defense is better than their attack. The only noteworthy player is the goalkeeper, Smeaton. His goalkeeping skills are superb and truly outstanding. After Chow Yin-yin, this is the man. If it weren't for him yesterday, Innis would have been shattered into pieces, not waiting for the final blow. The two fullbacks also performed satisfactorily. The midfielders and forwards are not worthy of excessive praise. The bald-headed center-back, Thomson, is acceptable in the center, but his later adjustment to center-forward was fruitless. The two wingers either did not understand Tung Wah's situation or were unable to apply their marking. The individual skills of the forwards are at a standard level, but the two wings are extremely weak. Their cooperation and coordination were never seen. In terms of attacking and shooting, none of them had the tough footwork needed. This is also why Tung Wah was able to maintain its virgin innocence and was not breached. However, the speed of improvement of foreign teams is often beyond expectations. Innis should not be regarded as a mediocre team and underestimated.</p>
<p>Tung Wah's Performance Has Not Reached Its Peak</p>
<p>Tung Wah's performance yesterday was generally satisfactory, but it did not reach its highest peak. The midfielders and defenders were all good. Lu Zhongen's save of the penalty kick was also commendable. The diminishing performance of the two wingers among the forwards was a flaw. Cao Qiuting was a step too slow, Wan Xianghua's wishes were not fulfilled, and Li Yichen achieved nothing. The most outstanding players were Chen Jiaqiu among the forwards and Gu Shangxiang among the midfielders. Little Dai, as the center-forward, did not lose his true colors. In terms of momentum, Tung Wah controlled most of the game. In the first half, the attacking opportunities were countless. If it wasn't for the goalkeeper's saves, or if the timing was slightly off, or the footwork was slightly off, they finally shot into the enemy's net in the 45th minute. Within ten minutes of the second half, they captured two more goals, and the entire Innis army collapsed and could not recover. In a relaxed atmosphere, center-forward Dai made another amazing move, winning a great victory with a score of four to zero. The starting lineups of the two teams were as follows:</p>
<p>Tung Wah Association</p>
<p>Lu Zhongen, Li Ning, Guan Xun, Gu Shangxiang, Feng Yunyou, Chen Hongguang, Wan Xianghua, Li Yichen, Dai Linjing, Chen Jiaqiu, Cao Qiuting</p>
<p>Innis</p>
<p>Smeaton, McKinnon, J. McCulloch, O'Connell, Thomson, MacFarlane, Collins, Kai, Lay, McCulloch, Mohalun, Muran</p>
<p>The Penalty Kick Was Just a False Alarm</p>
<p>At three o'clock, Marshall blew the whistle to start the game, and Tung Wah attacked first. Li Yichen did not bring his player certificate and was blocked from entering the gate. The ball had already been passed in, but Li was still late. Five minutes later, he finally arrived belatedly. After engaging, a melee ensued for a while, but there were no amazing moves. Wan Xianghua missed the opportunity first, and Li Yichen also kicked the ball from a corner kick out of bounds. Due to a misstep by center-back Thomson, Li Yichen passed to Cao Qiuting, but it was too late. After a quarter of an hour, Chen Hongguang and Muran were injured and left the field at the same time. After a while, Chen entered, while Muran limped off with his foot injured. The ball went back and forth in the midfield for more than ten minutes, and the situation became dull. After Lu Zhongen saved a dangerous ball, he saw the limping Muran lifting his foot and crossing the ball. The ball reached the center, and McCulloch jumped up to shoot. Unexpectedly, at this juncture, Chen Hongguang tried to save the ball from behind but committed a foul instead, resulting in a penalty kick. A bolt from the blue, a great disaster suddenly befell them. McCulloch took the kick, and the ball flew straight to the center, falling into Lu Zhongen's hands and being saved. The long-legged player added another kick, and the ball escaped danger. Ten thousand people applauded, and the sound shook the sky.</p>
<p>Although the Goalkeeper Was Wonderful, He Finally Fell Into the Net</p>
<p>In the following fifteen minutes, Smeaton merely displayed his superb skills, relying on the applause of the entire field. Tung Wah, having escaped the danger of this penalty kick, began a fierce attack. Due to McKinnon's misstep, Feng Yunyou passed to Li Yichen. In an extremely difficult position, Smeaton was able to embrace Li's ball with a single dive. Chen Jiaqiu kicked a free kick, Wan Xianghua passed to Dai Linjing, but the header was ineffective. Then, Jiaqiu's must-hit 200-pound cannonball-style shot also fell into Smeaton's hands. Again and again, countless times, infinitely wonderful, but even a cunning rabbit has three burrows, and finally it fell into our net. In the last minute of the first half, Feng Yunyou passed to Wan Xiang, and the ball entered the center. Little Dai advanced through the defense, passed through a block, and reached the front of the goal. He pulled up a kick, and Smeaton tried to save, but the ball had already entered the net. One to zero in the first half.</p>
<p>Like Splitting Bamboo, One After Another</p>
<p>After the break, Innis kicked off not far, and Cao stole it, passing it to Yichen, who mixed it into the shooting area and took a prone shot, but failed to achieve success. Not long after, Yichen received Hongguang's pass and probed the goal again, but it became an illusion. Mohalun and Kai took advantage of the opportunity to attack, shooting low to the ground, but the mainland foot had a spirit, and it bounced out shatteredly. Qiuting detoured deep and crossed. Center-forward Dai was watched and could not escape. Qiuting attacked along the side, and Jiaqiu followed closely. The ball reached the center, and Gu Shangxiang rushed from thirty yards away, shooting remotely at the goal and hitting the enemy's goalpost, bouncing down over the line. Only five minutes had passed since the kickoff. Two minutes later, Wan Xianghua rushed to the front of the goal and crossed to Dai, who passed to Jiaqiu. In this extremely short period of time, Chen Jiaqiu unleashed a heavy leg and shot fiercely, and the ball went in. Tung Wah suddenly created a huge score of three straight.</p>
<p>As a Parting Glance, Ah Dai Scores Again</p>
<p>After the situation turned straight down, it became flat. Innis was like a frightened bird, and Tung Wah did not push too hard. However, as a result of Cao Qiuting and Thomson vying for the ball, Qiuting's ankle was seriously injured. He was helped out, and it was said that the injury was not small, which was also a great misfortune. Although Tung Wah fought with ten men, they had plenty of leeway. Innis was fragmented and could not recover. In the last five minutes, Gu Shangxiang passed the ball to the area, and Feng passed through McCulloch and reached Dai. Dai, as a parting glance, swept with ingenuity, breaking Smeaton's goal for the fourth time, winning a great victory with a score of four to zero.</p>
<h3>Yu You Defeats the Western Merchants</h3>
<p>Result: Five to Two</p>
<p>While Tung Wah defeated Innis by four to zero at Yi Garden, Yu You also defeated the British Merchants by five to two at Shen Garden. Good news and good omens were heard at the same time, which can be called a double blessing. The Yu You vs. British Merchants match at Shen Garden was not as lively as the one at Yi Garden, but the leaping between the two sides was still enough to please the eye and delight the heart. Yu You's Sun Jinshun scored the first goal, around thirty-five minutes after the start of the match. The first half ended with a score of one to zero. In the second half, Yu You was like a light carriage on a familiar road, repeatedly occupying the enemy's base. Although the main camp was lost twice, the gains were doubled. Therefore, Yu You won by a score of five to two.</p>
<p>Jinshun Scores a Goal to Open the Record. Yu You's kickoff was unfavorable, and they were attacked by the opposing side. Zhong Yongsen relied on his nimble figure, dribbling the ball fiercely along the right side. Yu Xiang responded in the middle, raising his foot to knock on the door, but the power was weak and it went out diagonally. The offensive continued, and Wang Nanzhen came with two corner kicks in a row, but they were all ineffective. The Western Merchants, under this pressure, tried to resist and secretly actively arranged a counter-offensive route. Before long, a thrilling and tense situation reappeared in front of Yu You's goal. Goalkeeper Yang was very active, but Sinclair's header in front of the goal startled him greatly. After the game, he still felt like he was talking about a tiger and changed color. Zhong suddenly came to the rescue, leading the troops to counterattack. Chen Zhenxiang and Luo Haiguang advanced together, crossing mountains and seas. Sun Jinshun's iron legs had a spirit, breaking the enemy camp. The first half was able to take the lead with a score of one to zero.</p>
<p>Make Persistent Efforts to Determine the Victory. In the sound of renewed fighting, Yu You was full of vitality. Within five minutes, Zhong flew into the formation, leading the tiger away from the mountain. Sun Jinshun scored again, making it two to zero. Not long after the center kickoff, Zhong's right side came with a pass, and Jinshun passed to Luo Haiguang, who was full of courage and fearlessly fought through the gate. An inch away, it hit the post and bounced back. Jinshun did not allow himself to sit idly by, waved his arms and advanced quickly, and again announced victory. The Western Merchants lost three times in a row, and the whole army rose up. Left winger Frosh blocked Yunfeng, cleverly avoided Jiang Shanjing, and hooked from the corner baseline to the center. Sinclair followed closely, shooting with all his strength. Goalkeeper Yang slapped it out with both hands, but the ball did not enter the goal, and Sinclair had already fallen into the net. At that time, the dangerous situation was still there, and Frosh visited again, and was actually attacked by him. Unexpectedly, in a moment, Liang Shutang also scored a goal, which was passed by Zhong. Yu You took the lead with a score of four to one. The Western Merchants advanced again with a large army, and because they fought very fiercely, Yang held the ball and ran four steps, and was penalized with a free kick. Only three yards away from the goal, the defense was well organized, and they were able to escape unharmed. The spectators were all happy for Yu You. Jiang Shanjing quickly sent a ball, and the three generals in the middle drove straight in. The Western Merchants had an empty city without defense, and it was too late to save them. They watched Guttkin helplessly, and Luo Haiguang entered the camp alone, making it five to one. Four minutes apart, Sinclair took the lead and flew over, but Jiang's refusal was improper and he scored a goal, making the result that day Yu You's victory with a score of five to two.</p>
<p>Yu You Team</p>
<p>Yang Mingjin, Wang Shusen, Jiang Shanjing, Liang Shutang, Chen Zhenxiang, Yunfeng, Wang Nanzhen, Zhong Qingxiang, Luo Haiguang, Sun Jinshun, Zhong Yongsen</p>

<p>The Protection Along the Way Was Taken Seriously</p>
<p>The association has extremely complete and rigorous procedures for protecting athletes along the way in this competition. At the end of each mile, there are Boy Scouts waving flags to show the way, and when each racer is advancing in the middle, there is a bicycle leading the way. At the same time, the Public Concession and the French Concession police also sent a large number of detectives to patrol back and forth to prevent accidents. Therefore, when the athletes reach important intersections, they can pass safely through the surging crowds.</p>
<p>Passersby Watch with Great Enthusiasm</p>
<p>At the starting point, at around seven o'clock, in the dim dawn, we saw spectators coming from all directions. By 7:30, more and more people gathered. At the time of the start, there were no less than three or four thousand people at the intersection of Tongfu Road and Jing'an Temple Road. On the right side of Jing'an Temple, there were also a sea of people carrying the old and the young, watching around the walls. The front of Jiaotong University and the intersection of Hongqiao Road and Beidang Road were also overcrowded. It is estimated that there are no less than 30,000 to 40,000 people along the way.</p>
<p>The Starting Order Was Competitive</p>
<p>At the sound of the gunshot, more than 100 legs moved together, and a swarm of bees set off westward. Zhang Hongsheng, number 1, and Zhu Shengyuan, number 19, opened their strides, vigorous and energetic, and fiercely abandoned the crowd, becoming the leaders of the group. When they reached the Gessfield Road, the outlines gradually became clear. Zheng Chengshan used extremely ordinary and experienced steps, surpassing the others, and raised his head to the outside of the sky. Fan Qiang had high ambitions and kept chasing closely. Wang Jingren was also full of life and vigor, with wind under his feet, and was in third place. After that, Qiang Xianlun and Yang Derun, two horses galloped, each without giving way. Tan Rongsheng did his own thing, his steps were very steady, and he almost made a life-and-death relationship with Qian Qiming. They moved shoulder to shoulder and advanced, which was very good-looking.</p>
<p>Xiao Zheng's Great Power on the Beidang Road</p>
<p>In a blink of an eye, they reached the Hongqiao Road railway crossing. Fan Qiang gritted his teeth and did not give in an inch. Looking back at Zheng Chengshan, he was no more than five meters away from Fan, lowered his head and remained silent, and went forward to drill the road. Passing Jiaotong University and reaching Beidang Road, Zheng Chengshan saw that Fan was gathering momentum and was not tired. He was secretly surprised, fueled his feet, and tried his best to chase after him. When he was about to reach the Lafayette Road, Zheng was like a wild horse off the rein, rushing forward angrily. Zhou Zezhao was originally after tenth place, because his leg strength was abundant, which was really unmatched by others. When he reached the Yalpierre Road, he had risen from 13th place to the top ten, and was with Wang Jingren, Zhang Xianlun and others. At this time, the first and second place were far away from the masses, turned to Jiaozhou Road and rushed straight to Shenyuan.</p>
<p>There Were Many People at the Finish Line and the Applause Was Thunderous</p>
<p>At 10:02:30, the messenger came flying and said that the large army had arrived. The three thousand spectators looked up and sideways, and the leader, with his head held high and walking fast, rushed towards him. It was Zheng Chengshan, the pillar of the Navy, Army, and Air Force. Soon Fan Qiang came chasing after him in a state of anxiety. Tan Rongsheng gritted his teeth and stared angrily, earning third place. Zhang Xianlun was in fifth place and often said to others after walking that he was not tired. This man has a lot of capital and is a formidable material. After a while, the two saints of Sanduo joined forces and rushed to the scene. Qian Qiming's sweat dripped straight down from his forehead. Yang Derun was very uneasy because Wang Jingren was watching him closely from behind. Although he got sixth place, he was also very bitter. Yao Yaying, a young general who was on the list last year and ranked fourth, came out with illness this year. Although he was outside the top ten, his ambition was commendable. When the old crab Ge Jingkang reported with a rush, it happened that the tea party had started and the flower matter was about to end.</p>
<p>The Women's Race Walking Was Held Afterwards</p>
<p>After the men's race walkers had completely reached the finish line, the women's race walking was also held. All 22 participants were able to complete the race and reach the finish line, which was gratifying and commendable. It was generally expected beforehand that the championship would not come from Lin Yunfen and Zhang Xuesha. It was known that Miss Xu Zhongzuan was tall and strong, her steps were steady, and she was not rushed or slow, and she grabbed the first seat, which was greatly praised by the audience. In the first lap, Li Wenhua and Guo Pinzhen did quite well, while Miss Xu and Lin Yunfen were in the second group, and Hu Xiangdi was in the third group. In the second lap, Miss Xu's steps were the same as before, and she did not change from beginning to end, and there was no major ups and downs in her position before and after. In the third lap, Miss Xu showed her edge slightly, rising from the second group to the first group. At the end of the fourth lap, she began to show her skills, and the yellow-clothed girl Lin Yunfen went hand in hand with her, rushing forward hotly, and in a blink of an eye, she withdrew He Yirong, Lu Changzhi and others behind her. In the fifth and sixth laps, Miss Xu moved forward, and Lin Yunfen was unable to compete with this rouge tiger due to her lack of strength. Fortunately, Hu Xiangdi competed for a lot of territory in the third and fourth laps. Although she was already sweating profusely at this time and her delicate gasping was unbearable, she was happy that the latecomers were also as tired as you, and thus was able to maintain her position as runner-up. The competition between Fan and Lu for third and fourth place was particularly fierce, and their steps were active and relaxed, which was really a promising material. Other old veterans such as Zhang Pingfu from East China and newcomers such as Ling Yuehua from Shanghai Middle School, although their names were not on the list, were able to fight to the end. This is what must be written on behalf of the women's race walking history.</p>
<p>After the Speech, the Awards Were Given</p>
<p>After the women's race walking ranking was determined, Zhou Jiaqi respectfully read the flower names and scores on the spot, and then President Cheng Yize gave a speech, with many words of encouragement, and the listeners applauded. Soon, the awards began to be given, and the most valuable of the prizes was to promote the top three men, all of whom were silver cups and shields donated by important people at sea. In addition to silk flowers, silver cups and shields, the women's champion Xu Zhongzuan also received an electric clock donated by Sun Zhichong, who was enthusiastic about race walking.</p>

<h3>Rainbow Bridge Road Japanese Residents Show Off Their Skills, Bai Hong Suffers Defeat</h3>
<p>Japanese Resident Kato's Javelin Reaches 51.89 Meters</p>
<p>Yi Ze Cup Transferred for Half a Year</p>
<p>The international triangular sports meet between Bai Hong, Japanese residents, and Russian residents was held at Tongwen College on Hongqiao Road at 2 PM yesterday. The Russian residents were temporarily absent, leaving only Bai Hong and the Japanese residents to compete. Bai Hong was unfortunately defeated, but the scores in each event were still excellent. The final result was 64 to 37.</p>
<p>Invincible Army Suffers First Defeat: The Bai Hong team, comprised of the most outstanding track and field talents in Shanghai, has been undefeated in every formal competition since its formation, except for friendly matches. It enjoys an invincible reputation and is renowned both at home and abroad. Yesterday, it set out for Hongqiao Road, but unexpectedly suffered a defeat. This competition only included ten events, and events such as the 200m, 800m, 10,000m, hurdles, and pole vault were absent, which put Bai Hong at a great disadvantage and was a fatal blow.</p>
<p>Judging by the Scores, They Progressed While We Regressed: Bai Hong began the roll call, but the main player, Cheng Jinguang, was absent, leaving the commander's position vacant. The entire team immediately lost its center of gravity. Sun Huipei, Fu Baolu, and Wang Yongmin also did not participate, and the team's morale was scattered, showing signs of defeat. Looking back at the first sports meet, Bai Hong's iron cavalry swept through, crushing everything in its path, invincible. The Japanese residents' scores were immature and far below those of the Russian residents. Now, however, the scores of individuals such as Komatsu, Takahashi, and Kato have made astonishing leaps, beyond the reach of our generals. They progressed while we regressed, resembling the rapid changes in the situation over the past twenty years, which is truly lamentable.</p>
<p>Yi Ze Cup Lost for Half a Year: At the end of the competition, the Japanese residents won a great victory with a score of 64 to 37, winning the championship trophy. The splendid Yi Ze Cup will thus belong to the Japanese residents this year. All the Bai Hong team members were saddened. If Bai Hong wants to win back this cup, they must wait until next spring and make more efforts.</p>
<p>"Giraffe" Chen Mingliang Triumphs in the 400 Meters: Chen Mingliang's 400-meter performance yesterday brought a lot of face to Bai Hong. After Chen started, he was surrounded by three Japanese residents, but he broke through the encirclement after the turn and led the way straight to the finish line. His time was 54.2 seconds, which is very impressive for a 300-meter track.</p>
<p>"Jumping Tiger" Loses in Triple Jump: "Jumping Tiger" Zhang Jiakui won the long jump, but lost in the triple jump, which shows the ferocity of the enemy. Komatsu reached 13.73 meters on his fourth jump, while Jiakui was still at 13.30 meters at that time. Although he later improved to 13.45 meters, it was still to no avail. As for the long jump, Oka achieved 6.57 meters, and Komatsu followed closely with 6.46 meters.</p>
<p>In the Three Throws, the Enemy's Strength Increases: It is a pity that the "Iron Ball Giant" Shen Weishen lost to Komatsu. In the discus, Takahashi and Komatsu gradually took the lead, while our side only showed a tendency to follow. In the javelin, Tang Xianzhou exerted all his strength, but Kato was exceptionally brave. Even if Peng Yongyan comes south, it will be difficult to win.</p>
<p>Continuing to Lose in Sprints: Oka won the 100 meters, and Xue Jianqiu's score was also excellent, about one meter behind Oka. The time recorded was 11.3 seconds. In the 1500 meters, all five Bai Hong players lagged behind. Maeda's final sprint was powerful and very beautiful. The complete scores are recorded below:</p>
<p>| Event          | First     | Second          | Third     | Fourth          | Score       | Remarks       |</p>

<h3>Anhui Education Inspection Group Continues to Visit Education in this City Yesterday</h3>
<p>Invited by the Municipal Education Bureau and Others to a Banquet in the Evening</p>
<p>The Anhui Province Domestic Education Inspection Group, led by Yang Lian and consisting of 40 members, arrived in Shanghai on the 23rd of this month. They have been visiting educational details in Shanghai for days, which has been repeatedly recorded in this newspaper. The group has long admired the reputation of the Caohejing Agricultural School Group and the Yutang People's Education Center, and specially visited them yesterday. The details of the visit are described below:</p>
<p>Visiting the Caohejing Agricultural School Group: At 8:00 AM yesterday, the entire group, led by Mr. Yang Lian, went to Caohejing in western Shanghai to visit the Caohejing Agricultural School Group, organized by the China Vocational Education Society. They arrived there at about 9:00 AM. First, the head of the group, Wang Yinfo, reported on the organization of the group and the progress of its work. Then, Mr. Wang led them on a tour of the agricultural field, after which they left Caohejing for Yutang.</p>
<p>Visiting the Yutang People's Education Center: After leaving Caohejing, the entire group took a car to Yutang to visit the Jiangsu Provincial Yutang People's Education Center. After arriving at the center, the director of the Guidance Department, Mr. Lu Gai, first led them on a tour of the center. Then, at the invitation of the center, they participated in the center's welcoming conference, which was presided over by Mr. Lu, who reported on the establishment and business overview of the center and extended a welcome to all members of the inspection group. Next, Mr. Feng Maiying, director of the training class for people's education service personnel, reported on the overview of the training class. Finally, Mr. Yang Lian delivered a speech on behalf of the entire group to express his gratitude. The meeting then adjourned. Due to the urgency of time, they did not have time to visit all the promotional activities held by the center, and immediately drove back to Shanghai. At noon, they accepted a banquet hosted by Mr. Yang Xiaoda, the director of the Security Office of this city. In the afternoon, they split into groups to visit the municipal People's Education Center, the library, the zoo, and other social education institutions.</p>
<p>Lunch and Dinner Banquets: Yesterday at noon, Yang Xiaotian, the director of the Security Office of this city, specially hosted a banquet for the entire group at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA because he is from Anhui. He also invited Xu Jingren from Anhui and Lei Kenan, the representative of the Anhui Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai, to accompany them. After the guests took their seats, Mr. Yang stood up to deliver a speech, expressing his welcome to the group's visit to Shanghai to inspect education in terms of fellow-provincial relations. Then, Xu Jingren gave a speech, first expressing his admiration for the group's hard work in going out to inspect, and then talking about his recent trip to Huangshan Mountain in Anhui, feeling that the scenery of Huangshan Mountain is majestic, magnificent, and beautiful. He hoped that the group's visit would improve education and cultivate Anhui children to become majestic, magnificent, and beautiful talents. Finally, he encouraged them with the four words "practice what you know." Then, Lei Kenan reported on the purpose and work of the Anhui Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai. Later, Yang Lian gave a thank-you speech and reported on the current situation of education in Anhui and the path of future development, as well as the purpose of the group's visit. During the banquet, they also exchanged views on methods to popularize education in Anhui, until the banquet ended at 3:00 PM. When they came out of the room to take a photo, they happened to meet Wu Zhihui, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee, who was invited to the rooftop platform to take a photo with the group through Mr. Xu's introduction. Later, the group asked Mr. Wu to give a lecture, the general idea of which was that what China needs now should be scientific education, and that the implementation of this education should especially cultivate children's interest in science from childhood. At 7:00 PM in the evening, Shanghai academic groups and publishing circles, such as the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, the China Vocational Education Society, the Shanghai Provincial Middle School, the China Women's School, the China Children's Education Society, the China Popular Education Promotion Association, the Shanghai Secondary School Teachers' Union, the World Book Company, the Shixue Tongyi Hall, the Scientific Instrument Hall, and the Bookstore Cooperative, Shanghai News Agency, etc., gave a public banquet at the Oriental Hotel for the group. Shui Zi, the director of the Gansu Education Department, was also present. Chen Gongshuo, Tao Xingzhi, and Jiang Wenyu presided over the meeting and delivered a welcome speech. Zheng Xigu, Wang Shaoying, Lu Gaoyi, Yang Weiyu, Yang Lian, and Shui Zi also gave speeches, discussing the current educational problems in China and expressing many opinions. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until 8:30 PM, when the banquet ended.</p>
<p>Today's Visit Schedule: The group's visit schedule for today is recorded below: (1) In the morning, visit the World Book Company Printing Factory, the Educational Stationery Factory, the Kangyuan Canning Factory, the Shen Bao and Xinwen Bao Newspaper Offices. (2) In the afternoon, divide into groups to visit: the first group will visit the Shangzhong Experimental Elementary School, Shangwen Elementary School, Xicheng Elementary School, and Wanzhu Elementary School, led by Zhao Luqing; the second group will visit Daxia University and the 22 Society, led by Huang Jingwan; the third group will visit the School for the Blind, Jiaotong University, and the China Vocational School, led by Xu Jian.</p>
<p>Tonight, the Dadong Book Company will host a banquet at the Bank Club. On the 27th at noon, a education discussion meeting will be convened. In the evening, they will leave Shanghai on the Hesheng Wheel to visit Qingdao.</p>
<h3>Declaration on the Prohibition of Dancing by the University Students' Revival Movement Promotion Association (2)</h3>
<p>Only the dregs and scum within that group are clearly and vividly manifested. Although teachers are to students as fathers and elder brothers are to children, the school authorities can certainly advise, admonish, and even warn or expel the few dancers. This is naturally within the scope of their authority. However, if the municipal government sends police to arrest dancing students, it is still questionable whether it can exercise its authority within the concessions. Moreover, dancing is a matter of private morality and is not comparable to a crime. After reviewing the provisions of the Regulations on Penalties for Violation of Police Regulations and the current criminal law, there are absolutely no provisions for arresting dancers. "If the law does not expressly stipulate it, there is no penalty," which is a common rule. If you want to interfere with dancers, you cannot blame university students alone. The people who hold the same ideals as us are not defending the dancing university students, but what is right and proper. As for the various schools sending personnel to dance halls to investigate day and night, in fact, there are many obstacles. Each university has hundreds of students at the least and thousands at the most, so it is difficult to know each other, let alone professors and staff. The effect is difficult to see, and in the end, it may only be a piece of paper. It seems that the resolutions of the United Federation of Universities are worthy of consideration, and it is unbearable for the majority of our universities to be subjected to such criticism. Since then, the newspapers have repeatedly reported and exaggerated the situation. There is still room for public opinion to clarify the whole truth about university students, but it is not entirely absent. However, the general public does not realize this and completely dismisses them, attacking them severely as if dancing is a characteristic of university students, resulting in the hasty judgment of being tainted. This is no less than insulting the reputation and personality of our national university students. This is tolerable, but what is intolerable? The people who hold the same ideals as us are hurt by what we see and cannot control ourselves. We firmly believe that if we do not express ourselves, it will be assumed that all university students have acquiesced, creating an indelible impression. All kinds of slanders and curses are directly enough to ruin the future of university students, and indirectly enough to bury the future of the entire nation. Therefore, we must make a painful and sincere statement to correct the public's perception and clarify the truth. Mencius said, "Do I like to argue? I have no choice." As for the prohibition of dancing itself, in principle, the people who hold the same ideals as us are not without deep sympathy. However, most general dancing prohibition methods are superficial and scratch the surface without helping in practice. The people who hold the same ideals as us are not sensitive, and we would like to make a positive suggestion. We humbly propose five points as a modest offering. First, we sincerely hope that important government officials, social leaders, business celebrities, especially university professors and principals, will absolutely not enter dance halls, lead by example, and set an example, so that the effect of leadership can be achieved and a general initiative can be promoted. If dance halls are opened, dance magazines are published, dance stars are promoted, and dance queens are selected on the one hand, and dancing is banned on the other hand, is it not the same as only allowing state officials to set fires but not allowing common people to light lamps? Is it not the same as fighting fire with firewood? Second, we sincerely hope that the Ministry of Education can formulate the forms of uniforms for students at all levels in the shortest possible time and issue a general order to all universities and schools across the country to prepare them according to the style. Students should wear them whether they are on or off campus, so as to identify them. Then, the dress of our university students will be consistent, and society will treat them differently. Whether they enter or leave dance halls can be known at a glance. Third, we sincerely hope that the university authorities will reflect on themselves, expand facilities, promote academics, popularize sports, and strictly enforce military training, so that students are in the midst of spring breeze and timely rain, and have no intention of leaving school. At the same time, they should add legitimate entertainment, such as screening educational films, holding concerts, exhibitions, and organizing tour groups and visit groups. These are all enough to regulate the body and mind and increase knowledge, and the guidance to relieve the depression of young people is especially not allowed to be delayed. Fourth, we sincerely hope that the parents of students in each school will inquire about the recent situation of the students from time to time. Most of our university students live a simple life and study diligently. We have heard that a few students come from wealthy families, and it is inevitable that they will tend to be extravagant. We only hope that parents will control the use of students according to the tuition and pocket money required by each school. If the annual average is 400 or 500 yuan, there will be no surplus funds for extravagance. Fifth, we sincerely hope that all our university students will have a great determination. Those who have occasionally set foot in dance halls in the past should know their way back and stop moving forward. Those who have never entered dance halls should swear not to dance and never forget it. If there are those who persist in evil and still enter dance halls, our university students should automatically report them, identify them as harmful to the group and tarnishing the reputation of the whole, and find ways to eliminate them. Facts speak louder than words, and right and wrong cannot escape public opinion. If we can do this, we firmly believe that the misunderstanding of university students by the world will be suddenly resolved, and our pure university students will be able to win the sympathy of the people in the society. During this period of national crisis, internal troubles have not been eliminated, and foreign insults are becoming more and more urgent. How should the people of the country be vigilant, know what to love, endure hardship, and strive for self-improvement? Our university students bear the great mission of reviving the nation, and we should strive to be strong and move forward bravely, clearing away the clouds and seeing the sky, and reversing the tide. It is our duty and we cannot refuse. Shanghai is the center of culture and is also the focus of Chinese and foreign attention. Every move is a model for the whole country, and the influence of the trend is profound. Therefore, the people who quit dancing started with university students, and the places where dancing is prohibited should start with Shanghai. Moreover, there are countless social evils that should be banned, not just dancing. This is the declaration of the members of the University Students' Revival Movement Promotion Association, Chen Ruhui and more than 700 others. Sincerely, Yang. (The End)</p>

<h3>From the Rescue Work in the Newly Recovered Bandit Areas of Southern Jiangxi to the Public Clinic System (5)</h3>
<p>— A lecture by Mr. Pang Jingzhou, recorded by Chen Sheng, Bai Jiang, and Hui Ming</p>
<p>If we want to establish county-level clinics, assuming that a county has a population of 150,000, and we establish one or two clinics to treat 300 patients per day, then one out of every 500 people can enjoy the right to medical treatment once a day. Based on the above average medical and pharmaceutical cost of 12 cents per patient, the annual cost is 13,140 yuan, which means that each person in the county would only have to bear an additional burden of 8.76 cents. Even if the people have to bear it together, it is much cheaper than Sichuan's grain levy until the 40th year of the Republic of China, and all the surcharges on the land tax here, the burden of national bonds, and all kinds of exorbitant taxes. It is a pity that the people of our country pay the police donation but do not have property protection, and they pay all kinds of exorbitant taxes but do not get some medical and pharmaceutical enjoyment in life, which is truly pitiful.</p>
<p>I will take the liberty of quoting some recent statistics from the United States for comparison:</p>
<p>Medical expenses are 35.77 million - an average of 5.9 yuan per person per year</p>
<p>Expenses for alcohol, tobacco, and ice cream are 30.74 million</p>
<p>Expenses for personal decoration are 26.98 million</p>
<p>Expenses for clothing are 93.15 million</p>
<p>From this, we can see that the ratio of clothing expenses to medical expenses in the United States is about 3 to 1. Then, the annual clothing expenses of the people in the wealthy provinces and counties of China are far more than 30 cents. If it is 3 yuan, then the burden of medical expenses can be assumed to be 10%, which can also be 30 cents. In addition to higher-level free medical treatment, is it absolutely impossible to allocate 8.7 cents to public medical expenses?</p>
<p>(IV)</p>
<p>From all the facts above, we can draw a conclusion:</p>
<p>To promote medicine in China, we must use the shortcut of popularizing new scientific medicine in China. We should start from the countryside and think for the countryside. The reason why the scientific cause in China is so bad is because it lacks an independent spirit. It often rises and falls with the world situation and the political figures of our country. For example, since the United States became the leader of the world after the World War, the political figures of China have also followed suit. The general so-called scientists and medical scientists have also followed the political changes in China. As a result, many imitative giants and leaders have emerged in the cities. Politics is like this, general science is like this, and the problem of medicine is no exception.</p>
<p>We should realize that what the giants cannot see, we should pay attention to because we see it, and we should propose it and put it into practice. There is no shortage of people in the country's medical circles who understand affairs and are aware of the overall situation, regardless of so-called schools and departments. As long as we have a vision that fits the national conditions, we will regard them as comrades. We will do our best to work together on the road we should strive to take. The road we should strive to take is the rugged path in the countryside, not the avenue in the city. Although the avenue is wide, it is crowded when there are many people; the small path is the most difficult, but it will be opened up in the long run.</p>
<p>However, only those who are qualified, have vision, and have the ability are good at walking the rugged path. It does not mean that the doctors who go to the interior and the doctors who go to the countryside are second-class people. For example, to run a hospital in the countryside, you must be able to stand alone and have no reference. If you work with the public, you must save public funds, properly plan effective methods, and have good integrity to lead by example. Then you can create a good environment and maintain the reputation of new medicine. Its position is pure and noble, and it cannot be compared with the doctors in the city who can talk emptily and hide their clumsiness and follow the trend of the times.</p>
<p>Like this kind of comrades who are excellent in character and learning, have a far-sighted vision, and are determined to open up a bright and broad path for the future of Chinese medicine, I really hope for the many talents of today's Southeast Medical College. -The End-</p>
<h3>A Discussion of Hygiene, Medical Treatment, and Pharmaceuticals in Huaiyin (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Xu Fangyou</p>
<p>(1) Introduction</p>
<p>Huaiyin (also known as Qingjiangpu) is a small town located in the central part of northern Jiangsu Province. It connects Yangtong to the south and Xuhai to the north, holding a significant position militarily and politically. Not long ago, when there was a call to reduce the number of provinces nationwide, there was once a proposal to establish the provincial government of Jianghuai in Huaiyin. Our countrymen must still remember this. In the late Qing Dynasty, important officials such as the Grain Transport Commissioner and the Regional Commander were stationed here. In the early Republic of China, important officials such as the Military Governor and the Military Commissioner were stationed here. People from all directions gathered here, and the atmosphere was somewhat open. Various emerging industries were concretely and subtly present. Now, please allow me to discuss the state of hygiene, medical treatment, and pharmaceuticals here.</p>
<p>(2) Hygiene Administration</p>
<p>Hygiene administration in our China is fundamentally immature. During the era of the Police Bureau in the early Republic of China, Huaiyin established a Hygiene Section. Its duties were limited to cleaning roads and managing garbage bins and urinals. After the establishment of the Nationalist government, it was attached to the Second Section of the Public Security Bureau. Although in addition to the above three tasks, during the summer season, restaurants were ordered to add gauze covers to prevent mosquitoes and flies. Temporary fundraising was carried out to purchase "sha shui" (a type of traditional Chinese medicine) and other items for epidemic prevention. However, all of this was in name only. They were merely putting on a show. As for the actual management and prohibition matters, nothing was ever implemented. There is nothing more to say. I fear that this phenomenon is not unique to Huaiyin.</p>
<p>However, regarding the organization of local hygiene groups, in 1924, there was the Qingjiangpu Hygiene Association. The location was set up within the Qingjiangpu branch of the Red Cross Society. At that time, it was a chairman system, with Liu Dingxin as the chairman. He had registered with the Huaiyin County Government. I don't remember what the content and structure were. However, the main work that was obvious to everyone's eyes and ears was to hire more street sweepers to engage in cleaning. Secondly, in the summer, they purchased "stinky water" and sprayed it in urinals. The third was to purchase hygiene booklets from the Shanghai Chinese Hygiene Education Association for distribution and promotion, and so on. It was established for three years, received more than seven hundred yuan, and finally ended due to lack of funds.</p>
<p>Later, in 1930, the Huaiyin County Hygiene Association was reorganized. The location was set up at the original site of the County Construction Bureau. The association was a committee system, with Xu Muhu as the chairman of the committee. In addition to registering with the local Party and government agencies, the association also filed records with the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs and the Ministry of Interior of the National Government. Its content and structure were divided into four sections: general affairs, publicity, investigation, and medical treatment. The main work that had been done was to promote vaccination in the spring and autumn, inject vaccines in the summer, participate in the cleaning campaigns in summer and winter, and the Huaiyin Hygiene Movement. It compiled and printed simple hygiene leaflets for publicity and investigated the poor local hygiene conditions at any time, urging the Public Security Bureau to pay attention to implementation. It was established for two years and received 200 yuan. Later, in order to promote hygiene undertakings, it negotiated with the Huaiyin Chengnan Grand Theater to donate 20% of the ticket revenue for development. However, due to registration issues, it requested Huaiyin County Magistrate He Zhousheng to submit it to the county political meeting, which was rejected. A request was made to Hu Pu'an, the head of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, but it was rejected again. Therefore, it was unable to proceed and had to stop. This is a page of historical relics in the history of hygiene in Huaiyin.</p>
<p>(3) Modern Medicine</p>
<p>In the mainland, people must go to hospitals to see doctors using modern medicine. Therefore, very few people set up private clinics. Even if they do, they must hang a hospital sign. There are six or seven hospitals of various sizes inside and outside Huaiyin City Gate. The largest is the Benevolence Hospital established by the American Church. The hospital was established in the twenty-fourth year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty. Initially, it was in the Jesus Church at Bazikou on Hebei Street. The scale was not large. Later, it purchased land at Shuidukou in Dongweimen and built five three-story Western-style buildings and more than a hundred one-story houses. There were a total of 216 ordinary male patient beds, 106 female patient beds, and a special black fever hospital with 152 beds. It moved in 1913. The president of the hospital was Dr. L. Bell, an American doctor. The hospital had three American doctors and four Chinese doctors (no female doctors), thirty-two male nurses, and seventeen female nurses. The average number of outpatients per day was about 200. The total number of inpatients throughout the year was about 3,000 to 3,500. The black fever hospital treated about 3,000 people throughout the year. The hospital faces the wilderness and the air is fresh. It has equipment in all departments. The hospital is the best in Huaiyin, and it is rare to see it in Huaibei hospitals. The hospital is semi-charitable in nature and can also practice its benevolence for the truly poor.</p>
<p>The next are private hospitals, such as Delin Hospital, Qingjiang Hospital, and Junsheng Hospital. Their equipment is difficult to meet the conditions of a hospital. Other hospitals, such as Boji and Dingji Hospitals, are variations of clinics.</p>
<p>In 1932, when Chen Tiaoyuan's First Army was stationed in Huaiyin, the personnel of its military medical office organized a public hospital next to Chengnan Park. The equipment was very simple, and the charges were relatively low. When Chen's First Army left, the First Regiment of the Jiangsu Security Team came. The military medical personnel of its regimental headquarters continued to operate at the original site. Not long after, the First Regiment was transferred elsewhere. The Second Regiment followed. The hospital site happened to be obtained by the black fever research team of the National Health Administration at this time, and the name of the public hospital stopped from then on.</p>
<p>Huaiyin has never had a modern medical clinic established with public funds. However, in 1930, the Qingjiang Red Cross Branch raised donations from all walks of life and temporarily hired modern doctors in the summer to provide medical treatment and medicine, but only for three months. It ended because of lack of funds. This summer, the Provincial Qingjiang People's Education Center, following the Huaiyin County Hygiene Association, began to promote the injection of vaccines free of charge to engage in epidemic prevention.</p>
<p>(4) Modern Pharmacy</p>
<p>There are a total of ten modern pharmacies in Huaiyin. They are Zhongxi Lianghao, Zhongwai, Jiyuan, Huamei, etc., which specialize in the pharmaceutical industry. Others, such as Wuzhou, Zhongfa, Zhongying, Zhongmei, Jihuatang, etc., mainly sell general merchandise, and selling medicine is secondary. Even the above five specialized pharmaceutical companies do not have formal pharmacists who can dispense prescriptions. Fortunately, in the mainland, all modern doctors prescribe their own medicines, otherwise it would be very inconvenient.</p>
<p>However, there is one thing that feels quite inappropriate, that is, injection medicines can be unpacked and sold retail. Once, a friend purchased the remainder of a box of unopened Gonorgin from its pharmacy and asked for an injection. Upon closer inspection, it was expired. I immediately told him to return it for an exchange. I don't know if this pharmacy did it intentionally. However, it must be attributed to the lack of management in hygiene administration. The industry association is merged with the old pharmaceutical industry and joins the Chamber of Commerce as a member. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Common Sense Q&amp;A on Diseases</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(45) Stomach Ulcer (Part 2)</p>
<p>(Question) What color is the blood vomited when a person has a stomach ulcer?</p>
<p>(Answer) The vomited blood is mostly brownish-black due to the presence of hydrochloric acid in the stomach.</p>
<p>(Question) If the blood in the stomach is not vomited but excreted in the stool, what color will it be?</p>
<p>(Answer) If the bleeding in the stomach is excreted in the stool, the stool will appear black and tarry.</p>
<p>(Question) How much blood is there in a stomach hemorrhage?</p>
<p>(Answer) It's not certain. At most, it can be up to one liter. At least, it can be so little that it is invisible to the naked eye, resulting in what is called occult bleeding.</p>
<p>(Question) Is a stomach hemorrhage life-threatening?</p>
<p>(Answer) If a large amount of blood is lost, it can certainly be fatal. Otherwise, it will cause obvious symptoms of anemia, such as dizziness, tinnitus, yawning, eye flashes, headache, general fatigue, pale skin, and rapid pulse.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>(Question) Do people with stomach ulcers have a decreased appetite?</p>
<p>(Answer) The appetite is usually very good. They are simply afraid of stomach pain, so they dare not eat too much.</p>
<p>(Question) Is there any change in the patient's tongue coating?</p>
<p>(Answer) There is not much tongue coating. The larger one is smooth and reddish.</p>
<p>(Question) If a stomach ulcer heals, will there be any residual deformity of the stomach?</p>
<p>(Answer) Yes, pyloric stenosis may occur due to the scar formed by the ulcer, or a constriction may occur in the middle of the gastric body, resulting in a gourd-shaped stomach. There may also be a thickening of the scar tissue, resulting in a callus, or adhesions around the stomach.</p>
<p>(Question) How should a stomach ulcer be diagnosed?</p>
<p>(Answer) If the inherent symptoms are present, then it is easy to diagnose. Hematemesis in middle-aged people is often due to stomach ulcers. If stomach pain occurs thirty minutes to one hour after eating, then the ulcer is on the lesser curvature. If stomach pain occurs one or two hours or more after eating, then the ulcer is in the pyloric region.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the prognosis of this disease?</p>
<p>(Answer) It can generally be completely cured, but it often leaves behind future obstacles, such as persistent stomach pain, gourd-shaped stomach, pyloric stenosis, and adhesions around the stomach.</p>
<p>(Question) How many days at least are needed to cure a stomach ulcer?</p>
<p>(Answer) At least two to three weeks of proper treatment is needed for a cure.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the general principles of treatment?</p>
<p>(Answer) There are four points: (1) emergency treatment for major bleeding, (2) diet therapy when not bleeding, (3) protecting and covering the ulcer surface, and (4) reducing or neutralizing stomach acid.</p>
<p>(Question) How should emergency treatment be given for major bleeding?</p>
<p>(Answer) The patient should be absolutely quiet, lying on their back, fasting, and stopping vomiting. After one or two weeks, give them a liquid diet. Check the stool for occult bleeding. Only after there is no trace of bleeding can they walk.</p>
<p>(Question) How should diet therapy be done when not bleeding?</p>
<p>(Answer) Patients should only drink milk, eat chicken eggs, sugar, toast, butter, bread, finely chopped meat, and gruel. Avoid all irritating foods, and abstain from tobacco, alcohol, spicy foods, and carbonated beverages.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the method of protecting and covering the ulcer?</p>
<p>(Answer) It is advisable to take astringent drugs such as bismuth subnitrate, bismuth subgallate, and Neutralon silver nitrate.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the method of reducing or neutralizing stomach acid?</p>
<p>(Answer) Taking alkaline agents such as sodium bicarbonate, calcined magnesia, calcium carbonate, and artificial Carlsbad salt can neutralize stomach acid. Taking oil (olive oil) can reduce secretion, relieve pain, and cover the ulcer surface.</p>
<h3>The "Public" Cup</h3>
<p>— Huang Yiqing</p>
<p>It must be consumed by spraying!</p>
<p>"Thirsty people" also seem difficult to drink!</p>
<p>Language needs to be popularized (this is still acceptable in principle); cups need to be anti-"popularized." The "public cup" must be used by the public and at the same time isolate "the public." In other words, the public should be taught to use drinking utensils together, but the mouths of previous and subsequent users will not come into indirect contact with disease-causing organisms - common colds, influenza, diphtheria, scarlet fever, and disease-causing organisms of infectious diseases such as syphilis.</p>
<p>The actual situation is this: It doesn't matter if cups are used by the public in a healthy public gathering. However, who can guarantee the health of each member of the public at all times? It would be terrible if there were occasional germ carriers or mobile infectious patients mixing in. Look: are the teacups chained to the street tea pavilions or the rickshaw pullers' tea places feasible? However, in this situation, the public's thirst problem still needs to be solved. "Drinking," "defecating", and urinating each have general needs; however, random drinking is more harmful to oneself than random defecating or random urinating. This is the case on the streets, and it is also the case in places where many people gather, such as schools, institutions, factories, large stores, marketplaces, playgrounds, and squares, parks, and stations (if there are any). The public wants to solve the problem of thirst safely and reliably, but it can only be done by installing public drinking fountains in these places, spraying drinking water in the air for people to sip.</p>
<p>Regarding the installation of drinking fountains, as early as 1919-1920, people in Europe and the United States were talking about it. If the water flows directly up, the residual water after sipping will return to the nozzle, and there is still a risk of the nozzle being contaminated by germs - spreading diseases is no different from using public cups. Therefore, it is believed that it is best to teach the water to flow diagonally. In recent years, the United States, based on the regulations of the Health Association, has stipulated the standards that hygienic drinking fountains should have, which are particularly refined; such as the following:</p>
<p>(1) Drinking fountains should be built of waterproof materials such as fine porcelain, porcelain, enameled iron, other metals, or pottery.</p>
<p>(2) The nozzle should be made of non-oxidizing, waterproof materials; and the water should flow out from a corner in a vertical direction. The nozzle and the spring eye connecting the tap to the nozzle should both be higher than the edge of the basin, so that if the drain pipe under the basin is occasionally blocked, the wastewater will not overflow to the nozzle and the spring eye.</p>
<p>(3) The end of the nozzle should be fitted with a non-oxidizing mask to prevent people from touching the nozzle.</p>
<p>(4) The water flows out diagonally from the nozzle so that it does not touch the mask to avoid splashing.</p>
<p>(5) The fountain basin should be placed so that it is not located in a corner of the room that is difficult to clean or accumulate dirt.</p>
<p>(6) The fountain basin should allow water to fall into the basin without splashing.</p>
<p>(7) The drain pipe of the drinking fountain should be connected to the drain pipe with a wire mesh blocking the opening.</p>
<p>(8) The tap of the drinking fountain should be equipped with a flexible valve and a loose switch, or an automatic valve, so that the drinker can adjust the water flow freely.</p>
<p>(9) The height of the drinking place above the ground should be very convenient for drinkers. Several steps should be built so that children of different heights can drink.</p>
<p>(10) The opening and body size of the drain pipe should be sufficient to drain the wastewater immediately. A separator should be installed at the opening of the pipe.</p>
<p>It is a pity that in our country, everyone only knows that "thirsty people" are "easy to drink," and they are complacent in providing tea and drinks in the market. Even if someone already understands the pros and cons of this, anyway, the economy is so poor this year, and the sanitary equipment that requires money is really a bit daunting and dare not accept it. I don't know what era in various places will be able to rely on their own strength to install a few of these standard public cups to play with - some parks and schools in the concessions already have this kind of equipment, but unfortunately it was installed by others -? Now we are probably only forced to use the fashionable "public" as a cover for "cups"; we can only firmly remember the idea of "not using" it, and when we go out, we would rather not be thirsty if we don't encounter a reliable cup!</p>
<p>As for the fact that the drinking fountains use sand-filtered water, and in the cold season, people in our country may not tolerate cold drinks, this is not a very serious problem. However, students from the so-called Chinese Children's Public School in the Shanghai Special Zone use it very well even in the cold season, and there is nothing wrong with it, and there has never been any trouble, so you can know. In case people in our country cannot forget their particularly sensitive "sense of cold and warmth" and are unwilling to abandon it, then it can be preheated after sand filtration and then sprayed out. However, the heating here must have separate regulating equipment. This is a later story, so I won't go into details.</p>
<h3>Common Treatment Methods for Fever (9)</h3>
<p>— Li Xing</p>
<p>3. Sprinkling Water to Reduce Fever</p>
<p>This is a very simple treatment method. Protect the bed sheets with oilcloth or oil paper, and lay a bed sheet on top. First, apply a cold, wet towel to the patient's forehead. Use cold water (60 degrees) and first sprinkle it on both arms, then on both thighs, and then on the body. Sprinkle water with one hand and rub with the other. Sprinkle cold water again when it gets hot. When sprinkling, be especially generous on the back, because the back is the most important part for reducing fever. Sprinkle water in this way until the temperature drops, but do not lower it below 101 degrees. If the skin does not feel hot when rubbing, you can stop. When stopping, take away the wet sheet and let the patient sleep in a dry quilt. If the patient is very strong, there is no need to dry him in the end. If the patient is not strong, you can dry him first and then let him sleep in a dry quilt. If the patient is easily stimulated, you do not have to sprinkle water to wash the whole body at once. You can sprinkle water on one part of the body, wash one part well, cover it, and then wash another part.</p>
<p>For those who are particularly easily stimulated, and for children, it is not necessary to use the above method. You can first wash the body with a towel dipped in 105-degree water (hot water), and then wipe the body with 100-degree medicinal alcohol. Note that the hot medicinal alcohol should not be heated over a fire. Put the medicinal alcohol in hot water and heat it to 100 degrees. If the patient's temperature is very high, gradually lower the temperature of the water and medicinal alcohol until you get a considerable effect. The above is a very peaceful hydrotherapy method, and if used properly, it will be of great benefit.</p>
<p>4. Wet Sheet Bath Method</p>
<p>When the patient's fever is very high, a wet sheet can be used to wrap him inside. The sheet is wrung out from 80-degree or 50-degree water. These temperatures can be determined according to the patient's strength. It is okay for strong people to use 50-degree water. Weaker people can use 80-degree water and gradually change to cold water until the patient's temperature drops to 101 degrees. The patient is wrapped in a wet sheet, and water is sprinkled on the sheet. When the sheet is hot, sprinkle water again until the temperature drops. Finally, depending on the patient's physical strength, either dry or do not dry, and then change to a dry quilt.</p>
<p>Strong patients can also use the spraying method. Pad the patient's body with oilcloth or oil paper, and raise the head part of the bed by about one foot. Use a basin at the foot of the bed to catch water. Use a sprayer to spray water finely on the patient's body. One hand should also rub. You can stop when the patient's body does not heat up or the temperature drops to 101 degrees.</p>
<p>5. Half-Body Bath</p>
<p>A half-body bath is to fill the bathtub with water, and the patient sits in the tub with the water reaching the navel. It is inevitably a bit troublesome for adults who cannot move in the tub. But this method is especially effective when other methods are not very satisfactory. This is very convenient for children. Half-body baths can be divided into the following types, and appropriate methods are adopted according to the patient's condition. (1) Warm water bath (water temperature 95 degrees) combined with rubbing the body for five minutes, followed by wiping with cold water (75 degrees), and finally drying. (2) If you want the effect to come quickly, you can take a 75-degree water bath for ten minutes while rubbing the body, and finally wipe the neck and chest back and forth with cold water (60 degrees), and then gently dry. (3) For a weak, feverish patient, if his skin is pale and cold and his heart is beating fast, use hot water (105 degrees) for five minutes, and when his skin turns red, spray cold water (75 degrees) on his body, and then dry.</p>
<p>6. Full-Body Bath</p>
<p>A full-body bath means that the patient sits in a tub with water reaching the neck. If there is no tub so deep, water reaching the shoulders is also acceptable. With this full-body bath, you must rub the body separately. Full-body baths can be divided into the following two types: (1) Gradually cooling bath, that is, first fill a large half of the tub with 90-degree water. First wash and rub until the skin turns red, then add a bucket of cold water (note that cold water should not be splashed directly on the patient's body). In this way, gradually add cold water to 75 or 70 degrees. Finally, wipe the back of the head and neck with 60-degree water. (2) A full-body cold water bath is a very effective fever-reducing method. The water temperature should be 85 degrees at the start, combined with rubbing the body. Gradually add cold water to 75 degrees or 60 degrees, depending on the patient's strength. If the patient still has a very high fever, bathe him once every hour or four hours. The patient can also stay in the water from several minutes to ten minutes, that is, a strong patient can wash for ten minutes, and a weak patient can reduce the time appropriately.

<h3>Elementary Discussion on Pulmonary Tuberculosis (30)</h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Chapter 8 Clinical Examination Method</p>
<p>Finally, the diagnosis of lung cavities will also be briefly described here. Sounds like a drum sound with a certain range, amphoric breath sounds, large bubbles and water bubble sounds with resonance, all have diagnostic value; but proof by percussion and auscultation procedures alone is subject to two additional conditions. First, the cavity must reach a certain volume, and it is impossible if it is too small. Second, its location must be close to the surface of the lung; if it is deep in the lung and surrounded by air-containing lung tissue, it is also impossible to prove. Further steps must inevitably borrow from X-ray fluoroscopy! More details about this will be found below.</p>
<p>(3) Sputum Examination The most accurate diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis is nothing more than the confirmation of tubercle bacilli in the sputum; this is the only cause of the disease, which has been described in detail in the first chapter. It is an extremely important examination work that doctors must not neglect for patients. Moreover, in many cases of this disease, before the auscultation and percussion work have yielded obvious recognition, tubercle bacilli can already be found in the sputum (especially the sputum in the early morning)! This is something that no one can anticipate. On the other hand, we can also understand how important this kind of work is for the early diagnosis of this disease. The first step for a doctor to undertake this kind of work is to obtain the sputum, which is usually very easy to do in fact; but sometimes it can also be difficult. Because many patients only have a dry cough without sputum, especially those in the early stages of this disease. The first step for doctors to deal with this difficulty is to use ordinary expectorants, of which iodine solution is the most suitable. If it does not achieve the purpose, it is possible to use the help of a laryngoscope to gently wipe the throat with cotton to obtain cotton material, at which time the patient will of course cough; the positive or negative test results in this area are mostly very reliable. However, it is still extremely difficult for children, whose sputum is mostly swallowed into the stomach, which is something that doctors should pay special attention to.</p>
<h3>Ear, Nose, Throat, and Eye Hygiene Common Knowledge</h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(25) True Diphtheria (commonly known as Diphtheria) (Continued)</p>
<p>(A) Membranous Pharyngeal Diphtheria (Melnbranoese Rachendiphtherie): The throat is red and swollen. Both tonsils are enlarged and red. The entire surface of one or both tonsils is covered with a grayish-white membrane. This membrane is sometimes able to spread, involving the posterior pharyngeal wall, soft palate, and uvula. This membrane adheres very strongly and is not easily peeled off. When it is peeled off, it bleeds easily, which is a very important point in diagnosing true diphtheria. Inflammation often occurs in the nasal cavity. At this time, the nasal mucosa is mostly swollen, and the secretion of nasal mucus also increases accordingly. Swallowing is very painful and difficult, and speech is also impaired, sometimes becoming hoarse. In children, breathing difficulties and restless crying often occur. The lymph nodes in the neck are also often swollen and tender to the touch. The body temperature is generally around 38 to 39 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>(B) Lacunar Pharyngeal Diphtheria (Laknnaere Rachendiphtherie): The posterior pharyngeal wall, soft palate, uvula, and tonsils are all red and swollen. The entire surface of one or both tonsils is covered with one or more white spots, which closely resemble the white spots that develop with tonsillitis. However, the body temperature of this disease is not as high as that of tonsillitis (around 40 degrees Celsius), usually staying below 39 degrees Celsius. This is also a very important point in diagnosing this type of true diphtheria. The other symptoms are roughly the same as membranous diphtheria.</p>
<p>In severe cases, its systemic symptoms are more severe. It can also be classified into two types: gangrenous and progressive.</p>
<p>(A) Gangrenous Pharyngeal Diphtheria (Gangraenoese Rachendiphtberie): A distinct membrane forms in the throat, with dark black spots in the center. The mucosa surrounding the membrane is dark red and swollen, often dry. It often spreads to the soft palate or uvula. Sometimes, it is limited to the posterior pharyngeal wall and both tonsils. The tissue covered by the membrane often undergoes necrosis. The patient's general systemic condition also falls into a severe state. The body temperature rises, often reaching above 39 degrees Celsius. The lymph nodes in the neck sometimes swell and become painful, and may even suppurate. Speech often has a nasal tone, and the mouth emits a foul odor. Swallowing also becomes difficult.</p>
<p>(B) Progressive Pharyngeal Diphtheria (Progrediente Rachendipbtherie): This is the most serious and terrible type of pharyngeal diphtheria. Its danger lies in its progressive spread to nearby areas. On one hand, it spreads from the tonsils to the soft palate and uvula. On the other hand, it can spread from above to the nasal cavity and from below to the larynx and trachea. It is most common to spread to the larynx. At this time, symptoms of laryngeal stenosis often occur, and the patient is at risk of suffocation. The spread progresses very quickly, usually being discovered on the second day of the pain. The body temperature rises, reaching 39 or 40 degrees Celsius. The patient gradually feels a decline in physical strength and falls into a state of apathy. The pulse becomes weak, slow, and irregular. At this time, sudden cardiac arrest can often occur, leading to death. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Fracture Treatment Method: Renowned doctor and orthopedic expert Mr. Niu Huisheng, because there were too few books in China on fracture treatment, specially selected the book "Primer on Fracture" written by the Fracture Committee of the American Medical Association, and instructed his outstanding students Wang Jungang, Xu Chongen, and Qiu Shaoling of the Medical College of John's University to add, subtract, and illustrate, and translate it into Chinese with illustrations. It has recently been published and is translated as "Fracture Treatment Method." The entire book describes the treatment and first aid methods for simple fractures. It is divided into twenty-two chapters with more than fifty illustrations. All use demonstration materials and are described item by item in a very concise manner. The actual price is five jiao.

<h3>Pessimism and Optimism</h3>
<p>— Xiang Yu</p>
<p>Vulgar and skeptical people in the 1930s of the 20th century are probably still similar to those in the 1930s of the 19th century. "The vulgar suffer for their vulgarity, and the skeptical suffer for their skepticism." (See Taine's "History of English Literature.") The world surges with ideas, inspiring our extravagant hopes without satisfying them, teaching us many methods without telling us where to begin, and bringing us much misfortune without telling us how to escape it. Pessimists and optimists alike, the vulgar and the skeptical alike, the strong-willed and the weak-willed alike, are all wandering down the path of hesitation. Some say yes, some say no; the voices of yes and no shock my nerves. Some say they have found it, some say they have not; the voices of finding it and not finding it shock our nerves. Some say there is a solution, some say there is none; the voices of a solution and no solution shock our nerves. Many of us, bearing these wounds, passively walk in other directions to seek escape, either indulging in wine, or indulging in lust, either retreating into ivory towers, or indulging in cold ridicule and heated scolding. This is like an ostrich, only hiding its head, what about the tail that is exposed?</p>
<p>This chronic disease of the vulgar and skeptical century can never be solved by the vulgar methods of vulgar people like Saint-marc Girardin of France. Saint-marc Girardin once advised young people: "Do not think yourself superior to others; accept ordinary life, do not despise small morals; that is the only good morality. The demon of the Stagyrite is melancholy, or rather, a lack of energy and backbone, a negation of the soul. To get rid of it, respect the simple habits of regularity, respect daily duties, and interest above all pleasure. Choose a profession, marry and organize a family; in fact, there is no demon of melancholy, even the demon of melancholy itself dares not appear in front of innocent children." (See Saint-Beuve's "M Saint-marc Girardin, Cariseries Du Luudi Vol. I") Saint-marc Girardin's dogmatic idealism does not grasp the heart of the problem. The arrival of the chronic disease of the century is not caused by the demon of personal inner melancholy, nor can it be solved by finding a profession and getting married. To say that finding a profession and marrying a wife can solve all problems is simply talking nonsense in a dream. Moreover, in the current situation, apart from a few people, even in countries where capitalism has developed to the highest degree in Europe, such as Germany, there are many workers in her capital, Berlin, sitting despairingly on the streets with small square signs hanging on their chests with the words "Any job, I am willing to do" written on them. The problem of profession is currently not as easy to find as Saint-marc Girardin imagined, and the problem of wife is certainly not as easy to solve as he imagined.</p>
<p>Therefore, the generalization of the chronic disease of the century is not the fault of the individual. However, it is superfluous for the vulgar to suffer for their vulgarity and the skeptical to suffer for their skepticism. The reason why these vulgar and skeptical people are skeptical may be that they do not recognize the true cause of suffering, do not touch the method of solving suffering, or perhaps they recognize the true cause of suffering, but the method of solving suffering is bound by past feelings and lacks the courage to move forward. A healthy element in a society will not be skeptical, will not suffer, and will not be sentimental. The phenomenon of skepticism, suffering, and sentimentality in a society is a characteristic of social transformation. Society has been divided into two eras at this time. Many people represent the previous generation, many people represent the next generation, and these skeptics represent neither the past generation nor the future generation, but the waverers in between. These waverers neither move forward nor retreat. To say that they do not know, in some situations, they may know more than anyone else. To say that they have no judgment, in some situations, they have more judgment than anyone else. The reason why they yearn for the future on the one hand and are nostalgic for the past on the other is that they lack the courage to live. A lack of the courage to live will inevitably lead to decline. The world is a world for courageous people. Sean O'Casey, in his play "Within The Gates," sings:</p>
<p>The road is only for the strong, the swift, the fearless;</p>
<p>That which trembles for life in the life, let it die;</p>
<p>Let it sink, let it die, let it vanish forever from our eyes.</p>
<p>Sorrow and pain we shall have, and struggle there is no end,</p>
<p>We must mingle courage with our pain, and cut a road through unending struggle.</p>
<p>The road is only for the strong, the swift, the fearless;</p>
<p>That which trembles for life in the life, let it die;</p>
<p>Let it sink, let it die, let it vanish forever from our eyes.</p>
<p>Truly expresses the attitude that people in the transition period should have. Courageous people should be like this.</p>
<h3>Creative Experience</h3>
<p>— Shuming</p>
<p>There are many literary artists who, in order to meet the needs of the market, write things like creative methodology, novel writing courses, etc., to serve as preliminary demonstrations for young people engaged in literature. The reason why they do this is naturally that, as I said earlier, the nature of literary undertakings in modern times cannot but be custom-made commodities. Bookstore owners, feeling that young people generally need some basic literary knowledge objectively, and taking advantage of opportunities and tricks, is a weakness of human beings, so if there is a shortcut to take, it will naturally be enthusiastically welcomed by the general public. On the other hand? The objective impact of the things that these literary artists produce will inevitably become an obstacle to literary learning.</p>
<p>How do you say this?</p>
<p>Literature and art are social things, so their first meaning should be the study of life. Separating from the practice of life and going to some fixed formulas to learn, regarding them as classics and treating them as mysterious, is really a method of digging into the horn of a bull. This is because the content of literature and art is a living thing, and it cannot but reflect reality. Correspondingly, reality itself is also constantly flowing, changing rapidly, and changing and developing all the time. Only it is the inexhaustible source of wisdom that we should learn from.</p>
<p>If young people engaged in literature truly believe in the words of those literary artists? Regarding things like creative methodology as a panacea, spending all day looking for formulas and rules in them to be used for practical learning, then not only will the hilt and the hole not match, but the more they study, the more blurred it will become, and they will not even believe in themselves. This is because those things are just a bunch of rigid, empty, and abstract categories. When regarded as form, they are still very neat and impressive. If they are really applied, they will conflict with the essence of literature, its vivid content. And unfortunately, the content of literature corresponds to objective reality, so it becomes an insurmountable difficulty.</p>
<p>But if established literary artists do not customize things like literary methodology, but write out their own creative experiences for young beginners to refer to, then such texts with practical experience, although they may not have a decisive influence on the future of young people engaged in literature, can be read as personal adventure stories of some old writers. Even so, if a young person succeeds in literature, he still comes from the difficult study of life, otherwise he is unlikely to be hopeful.</p>
<h3>Concern</h3>
<p>— Caoming</p>
<p>Winter Plum Aunt, is the concubine of Ma Hongbin from Nancun who has been doing business in other counties for a long time. The villagers do not know much about her background, but judging from her accent and her clumsy but unabashed attitude towards men, people say that she is a "two-four goods" (a title for a low-class prostitute) from Guangxi because Ma Hongbin opened a timber shop in Liuzhou.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not long after Ma Hongbin brought her back to the village, his venereal disease "exploded and returned to the heart" and he died. After she cried a bit, not entirely out of grief, she quarreled with the tall and sturdy woman who picked mulberry leaves in the mulberry field before dawn every day. Two women with completely opposite personalities quarreled all night long. Before the funeral was over, the short, stout, sticky, and tenacious Winter Plum Aunt went to work as a maid at the home of a declining surname Hu family in West Village.</p>
<p>She worked at the Hu family's for more than ten years. The employers were often annoyed by the fact that she dressed too indecently, but because the wages were very cheap, they let Winter Plum, who was dressed almost like a beggar and unwilling to spend a single penny easily, stay on.</p>
<p>During these ten years, because of the issue of inheritance, Winter Plum Aunt and her first wife had a little contact; on the first wife's side, it was entirely because of her accumulated wages of more than ten years that she changed the psychology of Winter Plum, who could not hide her loneliness. The sturdy woman often used an aggressive tone to incite her second son—the one Winter Plum Aunt liked the most—saying: "She likes you, tell her to support you. Her pockets are very heavy now. Alas, I have worked my bones for twenty or thirty years, and you only get half full, but I have withered; your eldest brother, who is over twenty years old, has not yet married, and the youngest one, even if you hang him upside down, you can't squeeze out a drop of ink... Awei, you should follow that cow's temper well, in a few years, when she puts down the rice bowl, then you, your brothers can also get some benefits..."</p>
<p>Finally, one day, the sturdy woman's dream seemed to come true.</p>
<p>Winter Plum Aunt, because she ate too much clam meat and amaranth, immediately developed a strange acute illness. Her stomach felt an acute pain from poisoning, and she collapsed in the courtyard.</p>
<p>After hearing the news, the tall woman flew to the Hu family's house as quickly as she could, her feet barely touching the ground.</p>
<p>In the narrow ear room, the kerosene lamp blinked uneasily. Several women were frantically rummaging through bottles of cheap Chinese-style first aid oils. Incongruous comforts and accelerating groans made the air in the room very terrifying and tense. Suddenly, a tall shadow smelled in, separated the people surrounding the edge of the bed with crab claw-like hands, and half of her body reached into the tent, forcefully surrounding the patient's armpit with her left hand, who was lying diagonally on the bed and tossing from side to side.</p>
<p>"Winter Plum, Winter Plum, where is your money? Where is your life insurance (an operating organization for life insurance)? Say it, tell me, where is the money?——" The tall woman asked urgently, as if afraid that the patient would die immediately, using a trembling voice that had been agitated by excessive excitement, "Is it lent to Second Uncle who grinds flour? Is it lent to 'Water Bucket' Abing? Have you finished paying the monthly dues for Pig Raising Third Aunt's side, say it——you know I am your closest person..." As she said, she kept shaking the patient's short and fat body.</p>
<p>"My God! Saving lives is the most important thing! Where did this owl fly from? If you save her life, the money won't run away!" A woman exclaimed loudly and indignantly in an angry tone.</p>
<p>The patient seemed to calm down a bit from the disturbance, laboriously opened the rough things on her armpit with her hand, and grabbed her chest, scolding with groans: "Money? You should quickly go to the fortune teller and calculate whether your time has come! I know myself, I will definitely have a life of seventy years, enjoy the blessings before I die. You should care about yourself, don't care about my money——that won't do you any good..."</p>
<p>"Well, why are you angry? Be careful of your own body!" Who else is saying.</p>
<p>"I know," the patient said intermittently, "you are very anxious to be a daughter-in-law, you only know how to plan for that gambler... Awei, tell Awei to come and see me..."</p>
<p>"He, he went to the Big Pond to catch frogs, he doesn't know you're sick yet, so, you should tell me everything——" The woman's face looked even thinner and paler in the lamplight, and she turned to the patient with a slower tone. "Let's not mention the past grievances, you have suffered all your life, I have suffered all my life, what is it for, who will bear our incense? In any case, now I am your closest person, say, where exactly is your money put?..."</p>
<p>The patient gradually weakened, and the groans became prolonged and trembling. The women stared at each other's uneasy eyes blankly, and then discussed something in a low voice. As a result, the tall woman, with an unstable mood, went to the householder and proposed this:</p>
<p>"Mrs. Hu, I said, it's better to bring her back home to be safe, if she gets better, she can still come back to serve you, in case——alas, it won't burden you..."</p>
<p>The employer agreed. So the women lifted the patient, who had no autonomy at all, onto her first wife's back in a flurry. ...</p>
<p>But the first wife's urgent concern was completely in vain, and Winter Plum Aunt slowly got better. When she met me at the market on market day, she talked about this matter angrily.</p>
<h3>Song of the Don</h3>
<p>— Translated by Junhan, written by Sholokhov</p>
<p>'Our beloved and glorious land is not plowed with plows,</p>
<p>Our land is all trampled by horses;</p>
<p>Our beloved and glorious land is sown with Cossack heads;</p>
<p>Our gentle Don River has many young widows;</p>
<p>Our gentle father Don River raises orphans;</p>
<p>The gentle Don River's waves, contain the tears of parents.'</p>
<p>'Oh, you, our father, gentle Don River!</p>
<p>Oh, why are you, gentle Don River, flowing so laboriously?'</p>
<p>'Alas, I, gentle Don River, how can I not flow laboriously?</p>
<p>From my depths, the depths of the Don River, a cold spring is chirping,</p>
<p>In me, gentle Don River, the white fish are jumping.'"</p>
<h3>Cripple (4)</h3>
<p>— (Written by Zsigmond Moricz) Translated by Shuzhuang</p>
<p>Angrily, she tilted her head back.</p>
<p>"I, wasn't I born to be the wife of a poor man? You dog! Everyone in my family is a servant of the landlord! We are so poor that we can't even eat... How can they say such a thing!... People are really jealous... They want to marry a girl to him, a woman who spreads filth everywhere. This stupid embryo is going to marry her... At that time, I wondered why he didn't send me any news, since he received me so well the first time..."</p>
<p>She sighed and continued quickly:</p>
<p>"I thought about it, and that night, I came here. You know my husband is a night watchman, this is the only thing he can do, so I was sure I could find him... As a result, I found him; he told me everything! And I told him everything too... He felt a lot of love for me again. He also wanted me to live with him right away..., but I told him that this was impossible because I had to say goodbye to my family and take my own things... So he asked me to stay with him at least that night... So I stayed..."</p>
<p>She put her finger on her mouth again and smiled.</p>
<p>"At that time, I still had all my teeth, and he was very enthusiastic about me that night. In the morning, he found a small cart to get my odds and ends, and my documents. (Birth certificate, marriage and widow certificate, etc. – Translator)."</p>
<p>She spoke with chastity and humility, and such happiness shone on her face that it almost illuminated the dark room.</p>
<p>"Where is your husband?" I asked.</p>
<p>"He is in the city," she replied. "He encountered an unfortunate event. He fell from the ladder because, although one of his legs is a wooden leg, he still had to help carry the hay in. He broke something and had to be sent to the hospital. He stayed there for two months, and then the doctor asked him to leave because the hospital needed the bed. But since the surgery, he has been much better. Now he has completely recovered. The day before yesterday, I went to see him and also to get his monthly allowance of four 'Pengo' for the disabled. Thank God, he is as healthy as can be. Next week, when the cart goes to the city, it will also bring him back..."</p>
<p>A four-year-old child walked in, holding a child of about six months in his arms. Then, another one walked in. They were as rosy as early-ripening cherries and as happy as golden, beautiful piglets.</p>
<p>They surrounded their mother and pulled at her skirt. The woman wet the corner of her wrap and wiped their faces one by one.</p>
<p>...As for me, in this happy island, I felt very ashamed. (End)</p>

<h3>Current Rice and Grain Issues</h3>
<p>— Liu Tang</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>For days, newspapers have reported on the high price of rice, even exceeding the price limit set by the Social Affairs Bureau. Consequently, various parties concerned with the people's food supply have published discussions in newspapers, each with their own standpoint and explanation as to why prices are rising and why it is difficult to control, arriving at the same conclusion as those of us who write articles: there is no solution. However, the impact of these discussions can be described as "needlessly alarming the people," not only failing to help the general public's food supply but also emboldening hoarding speculators, amplifying their influence, and deepening their desire to hoard and monopolize, aiming to "dominate the market." What good is this!</p>
<p>I have always said that clear actions are better than empty theories, and there is no need for excessive words. Just observe, "What is more effective than vigorous action?" Especially those in positions of responsibility should use facts to prove their worth. Unfortunately, facts in our country are often difficult to decipher. Last year, there were claims of a bumper harvest, with everyone saying that low grain prices were hurting farmers, and there was an urgent need to raise grain prices to alleviate the farmers' difficulties. Although this was not achieved, the discussions were lively, as if the grain harvest was abundant and stored like mountains, at risk of rotting. In a short time, a severe drought arrived, and suddenly there was a poor harvest and no income. Rumors of grain shortages and food scarcity spread throughout the country. There were bans on rice exports, disguised as taxes; prohibitions on brewing alcohol. The attitude of "grain about to rot" quickly changed to the image of "no rice to cook." I wonder if the rice from last year's bumper harvest was thrown into the Eastern Ocean? Of course, this did not happen. Then why are the words and facts so inconsistent? Mencius said, "It is better to have no books than to believe everything in them." I feel the same way about the lofty theories of today's scholars. After all, unrestrained and lofty discussions should be left to scholars and writers. Those in positions of responsibility should focus on selecting what is beneficial and discarding what is harmful, choosing the path of righteousness.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>Rice shortages are common in our country. There are shortages during famine years, and even in years claimed to be good harvests. Otherwise, why would there be such large imports of foreign rice every year? The reasons for the shortages cannot be fully explained in a few words. However, the Chinese mentality of "relying on heaven for food" is a major factor in grain shortages. Agricultural practices are not improved, dangers are not heeded or avoided, defenses are not planned, and everything is completely controlled by the weather. Fortunately, our country has a vast territory, encompassing almost all climates from cold to hot to temperate. Rainfall and drought are difficult to unify, so not the whole country has a harvest, nor does the whole country experience famine. For example, the Yangtze River basin was known for its good harvest last year, while Fujian province reported a poor harvest. This year, the Yangtze River basin has a poor harvest, while Quanzhou and Zhangzhou are still okay. These examples illustrate that harvests in the north and south are difficult to equalize, but we still rely on this, even with limited adjustments, otherwise the situation would be unimaginable. Secondly, the prejudices between regions are too deep, and neighboring areas are regarded as foreign countries. Even in the time of Duke Huan of Qi, when different states knew that stopping the sale of grain was wrong, border closures and restrictions on grain sales are still common practice, even though they are repeatedly prohibited. Therefore, our country's food supply suffers from uneven distribution, leading to rotting grain in some areas and starvation in others, which is a common occurrence.</p>
<p>Whenever there is a year of disaster and famine, rice prices rise to new heights, which has been seen many times, such as in 1925, 1928, and 1929. The reason why rice prices remain high even when new rice is available is that last year's harvest was poor, and this year's new harvest is even worse. Furthermore, hoarders believe that if rice is cheap, they dare not hoard it, but if rice is expensive, they prefer to accumulate it, aiming for large profits in the future. Therefore, last year rice prices were so low that it was impossible to encourage hoarders to stockpile rice to maintain prices. This year, without anyone even asking, countless people started hoarding when the drought began. However, this year's situation is different from previous years. Before June, the whole country was still suffering from a surplus of rice and low prices, and thinking about how to maintain them. Soon, due to the drought, rice prices rose day by day, leading to high prices even after the new rice was available. What is the reason for this? First, the harvest is poor; second, farmers who have a harvest are reluctant to sell their rice, unless absolutely necessary, because they have heard that the drought has already occurred; third, rice merchants in the production areas have the same idea, and those with resources also think about getting involved, hoarding most of the rice, reducing the amount of chips on the market; fourth, since industry and commerce are depressed, and banks are cautious about lending and depositing, they are worried about having no outlet for funds, so they use the guise of revitalizing the countryside to move some of their funds to the countryside, buying agricultural products. Moreover, the Savings Bank Law stipulates that deposits must be invested partly in the countryside, and the Jiangsu Farmers Bank has established agricultural warehouses in various counties to collect and mortgage agricultural products. With the financial power of the banks to buy agricultural products, especially rice this year, which is the best target for banks to buy agricultural products, rice has been heavily stockpiled, and it lingers inland, instead of being transported to Shanghai as in previous years. With the source of supply to Shanghai weakened, rice prices can rise. The recent rise in rice prices in Shanghai is mostly due to "special Japonica rice." There is no actual special rice; it is called "special" to show that it is the best among rice. What is so good about it? It is only because it is smooth and delicious, not because it has special nutrition. The production of special Japonica rice is limited. Anything that is limited in quantity is easy to hoard and raise prices. This is not only true for special Japonica rice, but also a general characteristic of all commodities. Since Shanghai uses the term "special Japonica" as a substitute for good rice, rice buyers must say they want "top-grade special." In fact, whether the rice they buy is top-grade special, rice buyers cannot know. Therefore, rice sellers see that everyone wants to buy top-grade special, so they also label their rice as top-grade special. Those who claim to have top-grade special rice are moved to hoard it. In Shanghai, in years of poor harvests, those who start hoarding and raising prices are always the so-called "special Japonica rice." Once special Japonica rice rises, other rice also rises; once other rice rises, special Japonica rice rises again. Once prices rise, everything rises, and rice prices lose their equilibrium. This rise is the same. However, special Japonica rice is eaten by a small number of people who indulge their appetites. Most people still eat first, second, or third-grade rice. For those few people, no matter how expensive rice is, whether it is thirty or forty yuan, it is still a negligible amount in their total expenses. However, for families with a monthly income of twenty or thirty yuan, if the price of rice rises from ten to fifteen yuan, and if there are many mouths to feed, wouldn't half of their monthly income be used up? Therefore, the impact is great. If you think that the rise in prices when new rice is available is beneficial to farmers; and if you consider storing rice with the intention of hoarding it, which endangers the people's food supply, and you still give it favorable treatment, then if you do not destroy the small viper, what will you do when it becomes a large snake!</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>Currently, the rise in rice prices is indeed beneficial to farmers, as most of the rice is still in their hands. However, from the perspective of rural economics, it is difficult for farmers to hold onto their rice for long. In another month or so, as the Lunar New Year approaches, most of the rice will likely be transferred to the hands of hoarders, and those who can retain it will only be a few wealthy farmers among the poor farmers. When farmers put a large amount of rice on the market, rice prices will inevitably fall once; especially now, a rise will definitely cause a batch of rice and grain to come out of storage. This is because the minds of farmers and hoarders are slightly different. The hoarders will not sell until they reach their expected goal and time, while farmers, seeing rice prices rise, will definitely sell some of their rice, which can help regulate the price. However, after the Lunar New Year, rice and grain will gradually concentrate in the hands of hoarders. If there are no external disturbances, rice prices may remain high for a long time. Currently, the price of rice is 13.56 yuan per city dou, equivalent to about 16 yuan per Shanghai dou. The price of rice when new rice was available in 1929 was similar. In 1930, the price of rice was above 18 or 19 yuan for as long as six or seven months. Based on that example, who knows if the price of rice next year will be the same. However, if the wheat harvest next year is good, and the rice crop progresses smoothly, then the rice price may be slightly dampened. Otherwise, without regulatory solutions, it will be difficult to stabilize rice prices.</p>
<p>(IV)</p>
<p>Trying to completely limit the rise in rice prices with artificial forces, going against the natural order, will be difficult to succeed. If everything is attributed to fate, and there is nothing human effort can do, then the practice of manipulation will become rampant, and the people's food supply will be even more unimaginable. As for preventive and restrictive measures, the arguments should not be overly high, but should be in line with the principles of things, and the measures should not be rash, but should be appropriate to human nature. I believe that controlling food is not permissible in the current situation, but the government must have a plan for dealing with food shortages. The plan does not need to be complicated, but only needs to be able to cope with the environment of high grain prices in the past, so that merchants and the public know what to fear, and the government offices will not have no standards to follow, nor will they abuse their powers. I hope this plan will be announced soon, anticipating that the impact of high rice prices in the future will be even greater than in 1930. This is because the economic situation of the people today is not comparable to that of 1930. Since the great flood of 1931, the September 18th Incident, and the January 28th Incident, the decline of all industries and the difficult situation of the people's livelihood have been fully exposed. In 1929 and 1930, people deeply felt the pain of high rice prices. Since the situation this year and next year is not as good as before, the pain they feel from high rice prices will inevitably be deeper than in previous years. In this situation, I believe that the food problem in the future is the most important issue of domestic affairs. If we rely on foreign rice, it can solve the immediate problem, but the money will flow out like a tide, which, from the perspective of the national economy, is the same as buying foreign goods, a plan to drink poison to quench thirst, so we must still focus on adjusting domestic grain production. However, I have heard that Sichuan rice can be distributed to help Jiangsu and Zhejiang, but with the addition of donations and other expenses, it cannot compete with foreign rice. This is entirely due to transportation issues. The lack of adjustment of food supplies between different regions in China, and poor transportation, are the biggest reasons. If rice prices are high, and no plans are made in advance, and there are no effective measures after the event, digging a well when thirsty may find water, but the people have already died of thirst. Therefore, the following assumptions must be made for dealing with the future food problem:</p>
<p>(1) How should we investigate the changes in the grain market and determine appropriate policies?</p>
<p>(2) How should we investigate the production and sales of food and use it as a basis for regulation?</p>
<p>(3) How should we remove transportation barriers and facilitate circulation?</p>
<p>(4) How should we regulate the import and export of food and achieve effective regulation?</p>
<p>(5) How should we prevent hoarding and take effective measures?</p>
<p>(6) How should we take care of the livelihood of the general public and provide assistance with coarse grains?</p>
<p>(7) How should we promote the consumption of coarse grains and reduce the consumption of rice?</p>
<p>The above are just the major points. I deeply hope that those in positions of responsibility will plan ahead.</p>
<p>(V)</p>
<p>Furthermore, the poor harvest of rice this year is said to be the worst in thirty years, which should also be noted by us. A poor harvest in Japan will affect our people's food supply. In 1919, when Japan had a poor harvest, it purchased heavily from rice-producing areas in Southeast Asia. Our country also relaxed its ban on rice exports, almost causing unrest in the food supply in Guangdong and Guangxi, but fortunately, there were still abundant rice stocks in Wuhu and other places to help. More recently, in 1929, our country had a poor harvest due to insect plagues and droughts. The Japanese stockpiled rice in Southeast Asia to control the market. Now that they have the same poor harvest as us, who knows if they will compete with us to buy foreign rice. If so, then we are no match for them. If they manipulate the market, then we will be controlled by them. Although Japan also had a good harvest last year and is suffering from a surplus, it is said that there are still 16.38 million shi of rice in stock. Adding this year's 50.74 million shi, and the 13 million shi of foreign rice imports, and their consumption budget is only 71 million shi, and after removing the estimated 5 million shi that is too high, there is still a surplus of 3.7 million shi. It does not seem to have a significant impact. However, international situations are constantly changing, and the expansion of military preparations is in full swing. Food is as important as military equipment in wartime. Even though the Japanese government has more than 11 million shi of rice in stock, who knows if they will replenish it again. Moreover, we are frightened by the past, the great flood of 1931, and the September 18th Incident. Now we are facing the worst drought in sixty years. I don't know what the Japanese are planning. This is not meant to be alarmist.</p>
<h3>Review of the Japanese Silk Industry</h3>
<p>— Ling Wenqin</p>
<p>The failure of our country's silk industry lies entirely in adhering to old methods and not knowing how to improve. To this day, it has not recovered. Those concerned about the silk industry want to learn from the management methods of our eastern neighbor as a way to revive it. In the Japanese silk industry, in the past ten years, the successful transformation of the silk industry, the reduction of traditional silk factories and twin-palace silk factories, and the rise of mechanical silk factories have resulted in an increase in high-quality raw materials and a natural reduction in waste and secondary cocoons. However, since 1931, the number of mechanical silk factories has also shown a trend of decline. Although there have been no official announcements in 1933 and 1934, private investigations have found even greater reductions, which should also be noted. The following is an investigation of the number of silk factories in Japan in the past ten years:</p>
<p>Number of Japanese Silk Factories and Number of Silk Machines in the Past Ten Years</p>
<p>Today, our country's silk manufacturers are imitating what the Japanese have done, following in their footsteps. If we can obtain its essence, it may not be a turning point for our silk industry. However, the Japanese have an endless pursuit of academic exploration, and they are constantly updating themselves. Looking at the initial establishment of Japanese rayon factories, most of them were European and American models. Within a few years, they have gradually become localized. I hope that our silk industry will adopt the strengths of the Japanese and make up for our shortcomings, and not always follow the Japanese and focus on imitation as sufficient. It must be known that science has no boundaries. One person invents one thing, and then a thousand people invent a thousand things, so that the country can be strong and the people can be prosperous. Do not be content with a single gain. To transform the Chinese silk industry, it is necessary to start over. The original silk reeling machines are not suitable for modern industry. Although there are currently a small number of new-style Japanese silk factories set up in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas, the number is not large. I think that in a few years, there will be a large increase in the possibility. However, before we organize, we should pay attention to the size of the scope, so that human resources and the economy can be mutually adjusted, so that we can achieve twice the result with half the effort. The equipment in Japanese silk factories is not as simple as in our country. In addition to technology being a matter of course, they pay special attention to the cultivation of the lives of workers, so the expenditure is huge. In this era of extreme depression, although wages have been reduced by two-thirds compared to the highest level, daily food still needs to be supplied, and there is still no hope of rising goods prices. It is really difficult for the people in charge. Try reading the statistics of mechanical silk factories at all levels below. Those with a larger scope are gradually decreasing due to huge expenses. In 1923, there were as many as nine factories with more than a thousand silk machines. In 1932, there were none at all. This is clear evidence that large factories are not easy to support. I hope that our entrepreneurs will be vigilant, so as not to become difficult to manage in the future, or become difficult to get off the tiger. Japanese silk factories benefit from technological success, production increases, and the economy is such that each silk reeling female worker can manage twenty units (i.e., eyes) of new silk machines. Compared with the old-fashioned four or five-unit silk machines, the difference is indescribable. I am afraid that in the near future, the number of silk machines will decrease day by day, and the silk thread unit will inevitably continue to increase.</p>
<p>(Note) The silk thread unit is what our country's silk factories call the eye.</p>
<p>Number of Japanese Mechanical Silk Factories, Number of Silk Machines, and Production in the Past Ten Years</p>
<p>The silkworm industry in Japan is like the relationship between farmers and rice and wheat in our country, which is of no small importance. Therefore, silk factory organizations often require huge amounts of capital. Most of the smaller factories are rural farm families who raise, reel, and weave their own silk, and are used exclusively for domestic purposes. Those specializing in exports are factories with two or three hundred silk machines, and the funds are concentrated in the range of three to five hundred thousand. Business owners also absorb various factories to form a system, so exports are neat and can produce in large quantities. The following is a classification of their organizational situation, which is sufficient for research.</p>
<p>(Note) The reports from smaller factories are incomplete, so the totals do not match.</p>

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Credit is Extraordinarily Tight, Bonds are Weak</p>
<p>Many New Local Government Bonds Again</p>
<p>Last week, November 19th to 24th, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was the last week of the October futures. Although there was no special squeeze, the credit was extraordinarily tight, and rumors were rampant, causing an unusually panicky market. There were few shorts, and the longs were panicked. As a result, it was still mostly a squeeze on the longs. The tightness of credit is due to the outflow of cash, and the amount is already alarming. The HSBC, which has always held the hegemony of Shanghai's financial circles, has also been rumored to be undergoing a run. The thin reserves and financial panic are already an undeniable dangerous situation. In the blink of an eye, the end of the year is approaching, and the 70 million Sichuan bonds are bound to be issued. Therefore, the future of foreign exchange is bound to rise again. As credit tightens, the financial sector, for the sake of conservatism, is bound to sell government bonds to absorb cash and maintain its reputation. Recently, government bond deliveries require a lot of money, and the market will inevitably increase the sense of urgency. If there are other rumors, the future of the bond market is not optimistic. Moreover, most of the longs are in the hands of retail investors. Most of the deliveries this month are also retail investors. Financial panic is even more worrying. This is a temporary problem with government bonds themselves. Last week, due to delivery reasons, the longs were still rolling over. From Monday to Thursday, foreign exchange rates increased daily. As the delivery date approached, the financial situation became tighter day by day. Although the squeeze was not very severe, it was more of a squeeze on the longs. The market price was near low and far high. Sometimes, the market prices were the same for near and far periods, which was obviously due to floating longs rolling over. On Friday, foreign exchange rates did not move, but credit remained tight. The market price was maintained due to the short's slight offset. On Saturday, foreign exchange rates seemed to loosen by two points, but floating longs were still pouring in, especially for the troop reduction. The monthly period fell sharply by one yuan and one dime, resulting in a backwardation in the far period. In terms of the market price of each bond, it is still at a high level. If there is no turnaround in the financial emergency, the future trend will continue to fall. The result of the week's market price was a drop of several jiao to one yuan. The total number of transactions was 13.153 million yuan. The results of the increases and decreases are shown in the comparison table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: hundred yuan). Today, only the December futures are traded for one month.</p>
<p>US Steel Stocks Continue to Advance</p>
<p>According to a report from the New Fung Trading Company, yesterday (November 24), the New York stock market continued to advance strongly due to the strength of steel stocks. It is generally expected that the business of the steel industry will increase sharply, and the United States Steel Corporation will soon be able to pay off part of the accumulated preferred stock dividends. Auto stocks were strong because the outlook for the industry is very good. Oil stocks also rose because smugglers in Texas were fined more than 100,000 yuan. The bond market was firm, and the small exchange was strong. Chicago wheat rose due to the high returns in foreign markets, strong spot demand, and bad crop news. The half-day turnover was 670,000 shares.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones New York Index is as follows: 23rd 24th Increase/Decrease</p>
<h3>Finance</h3>
<p>The Foreign Market Will Return to Its Original State</p>
<p>Small Silver Coins Remain Stable, Copper Coins Continue to Shrink</p>
<p>Recently, due to the HSBC turmoil, the current foreign currency market has temporarily stopped exporting cash, and the foreign currency market has gradually declined as a result, and it is in a trend of restoring to its original state. Yesterday's foreign exchange market opened at 2 jiao in both the morning and afternoon markets, continuing to decrease by two points compared to the previous day. If the export side can stop activities as a result, it will return to normal in a few days. The transaction of temporary tickets was more than 3.2 million in the morning market, more than 600,000 in new transactions, more than 100,000 in the afternoon market, more than 400,000 in the Small General Assembly, and more than 600,000 in foreign currency mortgage transactions were redeemed, and more than 900,000 in new transactions. The Qianzhuang Foreign Public Bill received and released more than 46 million, and more than 600,000 in remittances from various routes. However, the bank's receipt and release were closed due to the Sunday holiday, so there is nothing to report. In terms of auxiliary coins, small silver coins showed both honor and disgrace, but the fluctuations were also extremely small. The Jiangnan small silver coin was 830 yuan in the morning market and 831 yuan in the afternoon, only 1 yuan better than the previous day. Only 3,000 jiao were traded in the afternoon market, and no transactions were made in the morning market. The Guangdong small silver coin was 746 yuan and 6 jiao in the morning market and 746 yuan and 2 jiao in the afternoon market, a small return of only 7 jiao compared to the previous day. 90,000 jiao were traded in the morning market and 70,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The number of copper coins has been declining recently, and yesterday's market continued to fall by a small 3,000 wen, to 310,000 wen. The number of transactions was 30,070 strings of wen, totaling 9,700 yuan in foreign currency.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>US Cotton Fields Increase by 15% Compared to Last Year</p>
<p>According to Washington news, the reduction in cotton fields will be 25%, compared to 40% last year. Outside speculators and manufacturers have slightly purchased, and the market is mixed due to the possibility of large shipments. It was firm due to the strength of Wall Street, and then tired due to the end of the longs. The spot price did not move, and the futures price rose by 1 to 4 pounds. British cotton futures rose by 2 points. Indian cotton was firm due to purchases by Japanese merchants and market manipulators. Pingguoer and Aomula rose by 7 jiao and a half, and Bairo Creek did not move. The original telegram is recorded on the left (24th telegraph).</p>
<p>Many American Cotton Brokers Trade Last Week</p>
<p>New York, November 23, cable report on the cotton market conditions of the week said that the next Monday is the announcement date for delivery, and the December period is the period before the flat, which is the characteristic of the cotton market in this cycle. The industry currently receives the December period to offset the sale of the later period when the price difference is slightly larger. There are very few sales in the South, and the industry and Liverpool, Europe and the Far East are all buying. At the same time, there is also news that overseas non-US cotton sales are less and the price is higher, so the New York cotton market is still stable. The general trend is to wait for the end of the December period delivery and the announcement of the government's cotton field program for next year, so transactions are restricted. The demand for spot cotton is light, and domestic cotton mills are not currently purchasing. They want to wait for the announcement of the cotton field program and the revival of cotton demand before starting activities. Export demand is also limited, but there is a saying that Japan wants to purchase low-grade cotton. At the same time, the authorities want to attract the industrial and banking sectors to cooperate to carry out the recovery program, so the market's popularity is slightly boosted for the future of general business.</p>
<p>Opening Up New Markets Overseas</p>
<p>Shanghai Japanese cotton yarn was originally sold to various ports in China, but after the September 18th Incident, sales in China shrank. Japanese trading companies changed their sales to the three northeastern provinces, Nanyang, and India, and have now achieved considerable results. Recently, they have opened up a new market in Gothenburg, Sweden, the center of the textile industry in Northern Europe, which has attracted general attention. This is through the Shanghai branch of Ito Trading Company, through its parent company to a Dutch trading company, and Gothenburg's sales have been satisfactorily reached, and all samples will be shipped by the convenient ship of recent exports. These yarns include various counts, and the transaction will probably start with fine-count yarn first. Those exported by the country are mainly cotton cloth. Although there is an output of cotton yarn, it is very small. Moreover, the cost of cotton yarn in Japanese factories in China is lower than that of yarn in Japan, so the future is very promising.</p>
<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>River Rice Stabilizes</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Over thirty sources of supplies from various groups (totaling nearly 5,000 piculs), normal sales in the local market. However, customer groups from Qingdao and Yantai have continued to contract for over 1,000 packages, slightly reassuring the market, and the situation is stabilizing. Prices for late rice from Qingjiao, Songjiang, West Lian, and Chang groups, as well as thick japonica rice from Su and Tong groups and Nan'gang, are all showing stabilization. Du Yangjian and Yin Yuan varieties are generally showing similar stabilization.</p>

<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, eighteen or nineteen ships arrived from various routes downstream. White rice for catering is still slow. Prices for goods of upper and middle quality have slightly increased. Yang Du, Bu Ke, pointed rice, thin rice, and early thin rice are also similar. The price of new white rice has stabilized. White rice prices are slightly higher, except for small corner rice. Early rice is up by a small two or three cents, thin rice is up by a corner, Yang Du pointed rice is also up by about a corner, the rest of the goods are flat and weak.</p>

<h3>Metals</h3>
<p>American Tinplate Shortage</p>
<p>The market for American tinplate has seen reduced arrivals since the influx of German and Italian goods. Recently, purchasing agents have suddenly increased procurement, leading to a shortage of spot goods. Standard prices have gradually risen, with single-linked goods now quoted at $16.50 per box (up another five cents from before), and double-linked goods at $32.25 per box. Although yesterday was Sunday, over 500-600 boxes were still traded. Printing factories are still interested in buying, but with limited inventory, prices are expected to rise further. Moreover, overseas prices are at $4.50 and $8.95 gold yuan per box, respectively. Combined with the current exchange rates, it remains unprofitable, so few orders are being placed.</p>
<h3>Textiles</h3>
<p>New Popular Long-Haired Camel Wool Overcoats</p>
<p>Price: $150-160 per coat</p>
<p>Long-haired camel wool overcoats have become very popular recently. Wealthy customers are increasingly choosing this material for overcoat faces. High-end Western clothing stores along Nanjing Road, Sichuan Road, and Avenue Joffre have received many orders, each coat costing $150-160, and customers are not finding it expensive. Ordinary thick wool coats and leather overcoats have become tiresome, and wearing long-haired camel wool overcoats to social gatherings is now fashionable. This type of long-haired camel wool is only sold in break-bulk stores in the Hongkou area. Lianxing sells it for over $20 per yard, while Meifa and Yichangtai sell it for $17.50 per yard. Colors include yellow, black, gray, and blue. It is predicted that it will become popular throughout Shanghai next winter, with a sharp increase in orders and lower prices.</p>
<p>Broadcloth and Serge Prices Plunge</p>
<p>Regarding broadcloth, due to high prices and shortages of old stock last year, many in the industry placed large orders, resulting in an oversupply and a market downturn. Deji's 2488 Four Filial Piety design has fallen from $5.75 to $5.40. While Rongtai's 15330 Old Man brand and Anli's Treasure Bowl Old Man brand maintain nominal prices, they are also showing signs of weakness. Serge prices were initially more stable than broadcloth due to the cold weather, but sales sharply declined. However, due to limited arrivals, prices have risen, in contrast to broadcloth. This is due to lessons learned from last year's oversaturated market of Japanese serge, where Western goods suffered losses and were sold off, leading to large drops in orders. Currently, Rongtai's top brand of serge is still selling at $4.40 wholesale, Deji's Dafacai at $4.175, and 1313 at $3.25. Common brands of hidden gray serge are priced around $3.30-3.40.</p>

<p>Shen Bao Local Supplement</p>
<p>that ferry crossing, that dilapidated boat which needed to be hauled ashore twice a year, was his entire fortune.</p>
<p>Some things are much easier to manage in the countryside than in the city. For example, Old Li, who set up this ferry crossing, was neither a native of this village, nor did he have to put up with the local bullies constantly hounding him to the point where he couldn't hear customers calling from across the river. He was also able to roll copper coins, but he wasn't as accurate as we kids. When he lost, he would shake his head and sigh to himself:</p>
<p>"Old, useless!"</p>
<p>He would raise the back of his hand to wipe his eyelids and then decide on the next round.</p>
<p>Old Li had to drink several copper coins worth of spirits every day. He never had any side dishes. The bottle was kept in the pocket of his short coat and he would pull it out at any time, tip it to his mouth and take a swig. Every time he drank, he would shake his head, I don't know if it was a habit or if the liquor made him uncomfortable. Because we saw him cry like a child a few times after drinking, but sometimes he was also exceptionally happy. In short, Old Li gave us children a very good impression.</p>
<p>I went to study in the county town when I was ten years old, and I only saw Old Li during the two winter and summer vacations each year. He was still drinking and shaking the ferry.</p>
<p>I can't calculate the years that followed myself. A few years ago, I returned home and my family told me that Old Li's son had run away. I went to the ferry crossing to see him specifically. He didn't recognize me anymore, and he was wary because there was no one dressed like me in this village. I called him Old Li, and he raised the back of his hand to wipe his eyelids again, but he just stood there blankly for a long time, not knowing who I was. I told him my childhood name (because that's all he knew), and he laughed heartily and pulled me into his thatched hut, saying, "Old, useless!"</p>
<p>I turned around and saw a candy stall set up in front of the thatched hut. I asked him, and he said that the shop owner was Old Li. Walking inside, the scale of the stall wasn't too shabby. In front were all kinds of candy for children, and inside were a lot of goods. He had almost everything a rural family needed, like kerosene, cigarettes, and toilet paper.</p>
<p>"Old Li, you've made a fortune, you're a big boss," I said to him with a smile.</p>
<p>He shook his head and poured me a cup of tea.</p>
<p>"My son ran away..."</p>
<p>He said sadly as soon as he sat down, as if he was starting a long piece of writing, but he was interrupted by someone calling him to take care of customers; and this sentence was never said, even after my questioning. In the end, he just cried.</p>
<p>Well, Old Li is dead. This poor old man who lived his whole life for the sake of living has died, and his coffin was still collected door-to-door!</p>
<p>I always wanted to have a chance to ask some of the oldest elders in my hometown about that sentence he didn't want to say; this is of course an empty promise, I can't even predict my own affairs!</p>
<p>These past shadows now follow me again, as if I can't let go of a major concern.</p>

<p>Discussions</p>
<h3>Poring Over Words</h3>
<p>— Pi</p>
<p>The other day, I was chatting with a friend, and he mentioned that when he was young, he studied in a private school. An old gentleman was teaching him Mencius, and when he read "Zhou in the seventh and eighth months, Xia in the fifth and sixth months," the old gentleman said that the word "Zhou" was wrong, it was obviously a mistake for "Qiu" (autumn), so he changed the word "Zhou" in the book to "Qiu." Later, my friend told his father and brothers, and none of them could help but laugh.</p>
<p>I said, don't laugh at him. Nowadays, it is very difficult to find a teacher who "gains insight from reading" and is good at understanding. Aren't the seventh and eighth months autumn? Aren't the fifth and sixth months summer? It is not easy to find a teacher who is willing to look at books with such care.</p>
<p>In the old days of the imperial examinations, there was an exam where one of the proctors looked at the exam questions and came back. The other proctors asked him what the questions were. He said, "People know it also Ning Ning (pronounced), people don't know it also Ning Ning." The other proctors were baffled, thinking that the "Analects" and "Mencius" never had these two sentences. Later, when they saw the questions, they realized that this proctor had misread the characters, mistaking "Xiao Xiao" (boastful) for "Yin Yin" (stupid). Everyone laughed. Later, when the list was posted, this proctor who misread characters actually topped the list, so it can be seen that misreading characters is not that important.</p>
<p>When I was a child, my teacher often scolded me for "not making progress." I was extremely angry. One day, I resolved to study hard. So I took a few old classics, such as the Book of Strategies, Historical Records, and Book of Han, and read them over and over again. Some of them I seemed to understand, and some I simply didn't understand at all. The books I marked were often completely unrelated, just picked up at random. One day, I saw a passage in a book that I really couldn't understand, so I went to consult a teacher who was very knowledgeable.</p>
<p>But this old gentleman looked at this passage for a long time and was also somewhat unsure. So he made a big argument, saying that this sentence could be punctuated this way or that way, but punctuating it this way would have one meaning, and punctuating it that way would have another meaning. Therefore, when you read books, you must study textual research, exegesis, and annotations. Only then can you understand it thoroughly and clearly understand the meaning.</p>
<p>After hearing this big argument, I was so angry that I turned to the twelfth chapter of bewilderment, and immediately threw these books into the loft, resolving never to read such muddled books again, believing that this kind of effort was only for bookworms. That's why my belly is empty and I have no books in it.</p>
<p>In the fifth and sixth years of the Republic of China, I heard several talented and ink-stained gentlemen "advocating vernacular literature" and "overthrowing ancient books," wanting to invite Confucius to the latrine. It is said that the crime of these ancient books was that they had too many connotations, muddled sentences, and corrupting thoughts. I was very excited when I heard this, thinking that from now on, I wouldn't have to waste my brain on this meaningless effort and become a bookworm. But in the end, I was still greatly disappointed, because some vernacular literature, although written very long and well, was still incomprehensible and I didn't understand its meaning at all. This kind of vernacular literature is not uncommon.</p>
<p>It is said that for this reason, we are now taking it a step further. Some advocate popular language, some advocate writing incorrect characters, and some advocate Latinization. If these methods are really produced, we can also be spared the crime of being a bookworm. But the date for implementing these methods is probably still far away, and I am starting to feel a little hesitant, regretting that I didn't listen to the old gentleman and study textual research, annotations, and exegesis, after all, it is reliable.</p>
<h3>Rambling About Clipping Newspaper</h3>
<p>— Yefei</p>
<p>I think clipping newspapers is a very interesting and meaningful thing, so my newspaper clipping has become a habit, a habit that has become natural; every day I have to clip all the news, commentaries, special articles, novels, essays, miscellaneous discussions, etc. that I have read in the newspaper and paste them into several volumes. For example, the commentaries in the × newspaper are titled "× Newspaper Essays," current affairs news is titled "Current Affairs Sketches," international news is titled "International Gleanings," social news is titled "Social Snapshots," local communications are titled "Rural Cities," long novels are titled "Novel Library," essays are titled "Essay Selections," film texts are titled "Silver Sea," and special articles are titled "Special Article Selections." I clip and paste like this every day and never find it troublesome.</p>
<p>Indeed, I feel such interest in clipping newspapers, and the reason for this interest naturally has a great cause!</p>
<p>If you take out the old newspapers to read, I believe it will be more interesting than reading unofficial or unofficial history novels, because everyone knows that novels are made up, while newspapers are records of facts. It's like taking a picture of yourself from childhood and looking at it, you not only find it cute, but you also relive your childhood dreams in fantasy! Moreover, our memory is not so strong that we can remember things from eight or ten years ago. And if we accumulate newspapers every year, on the one hand, we may not have that much extra space to store them, and on the other hand, even if we store them, it will be difficult to find them when we want to read them, so clipping and pasting the newspapers we read every day separately is really a very good method.</p>
<p>In this, you can see the changes of the times, the changes of personnel, the evolution of society, the trends of international affairs, and all kinds of strange and bizarre news. What was not worth looking at at the time will be strangely interesting now. It is really more meaningful than reading world-famous books. And you can also take the past political, economic, and other situations and compare them with the present, especially for people who are engaged in writing, you can use it as dozens of reference books.</p>
<p>For example, from the autocracy of the Manchu Qing Dynasty to the revolutionary uprising, and then to the warlord infighting and exploitation, to the swearing-in of the Northern Expedition and the establishment of Jiangnan, the invasion of Shenyang by the Japanese in the September 18th Incident, the enthusiastic movement of the people, and the January 28th Battle of Shanghai, etc., there must be many valuable historical materials in between. If you rely on your brain to remember, I think all human beings have no such big brain. If you clip and paste the newspapers year by year into a book, then it is easy to store and more convenient to browse. With this book in hand, you can read ten thousand volumes of famous books. I think this easy thing is really worth advocating.</p>
<p>I often see many people reading newspapers, only looking at the supplements or social news. Most people don't care about international, political, and current affairs commentaries. Their purpose of reading the newspaper is only for entertainment, and no one has obliterated the righteousness of reading the newspaper. Some people just flip through it and think it's over, isn't this a joke? Moreover, in China, which is known as 400 million people, the oldest newspaper only sells more than 100,000 copies, which is really pitiful! According to my proposal, we should develop the habit of reading newspapers, and pay more attention to international and political news, and know how important the responsibility of newspapers is to the country, to the nation, to society, and to cultural education. This is an indispensable cultivation for us in reading newspapers. Finally, I would like to earnestly advocate clipping and pasting newspapers. Of course, being able to clip and paste important daily records into a book is indeed a very beneficial thing.</p>
<h3>Walking Maoshan</h3>
<p>— Yonghui</p>
<p>It has been a week, and not only have I not reached the Seventh Layer of Shifting Sands, but not even a tiger or leopard has come to block the first gate. My heart is burning. Logically, with such sincerity in walking Maoshan, the Supreme Lord Lao would definitely accept me as a disciple.</p>
<p>I have heard many legends about Maoshan, although I have not personally experienced them. —— A heart wholly devoted to the Tao, and only through enduring countless hardships can one see the patriarch of Maoshan —— the Supreme Lord Lao.</p>
<p>It is said that the first gate is guarded by tigers and leopards with bared teeth and claws. I am ready for this. As long as my mind is free from distracting thoughts and I recite the true words of the Supreme Lord Lao, the tigers and leopards will vanish without a trace. I continue to walk forward.</p>
<p>Seven miles of shifting sands spread out before me, an endless expanse of golden yellow sand. When the heart is not righteous, the flat sandy ground will conjure up a bottomless abyss, with demons with disheveled hair and fangs blocking the way ahead, and vengeful ghosts chasing closely behind. One careless step and you fall into the abyss, to be devoured alive by the demons.</p>
<p>I fear nothing. My heart devoted to the Tao is strong, and I am only waiting for the demons to arrive. Unfortunately, I have yet to encounter any demons blocking my path! The Maoshan in my mind is still in the realm of illusion.</p>
<p>The smoke trails are guiding my way —— the way to Maoshan (?). (Note —— It is said that those who walk Maoshan must hold a incense tray in their hands, and the direction of their journey is determined by the direction the smoke is blown by the wind.)</p>
<p>"Perhaps I will have to walk for six sixes, thirty-six days?" I think to myself. Thirty-six days is a very long time. The roasted rice I have with me is only enough to eat for two days, and I will starve to death in a few more days.</p>
<p>Tigers, leopards, and demons can all be repelled with a heart devoted to the Tao (?), but when there is no roasted rice to eat, a heart devoted to the Tao cannot fill the stomach.</p>
<p>I am starting to feel uneasy! As soon as this uneasiness creeps into my heart, I immediately force it down —— having thoughts of retreat will be punished by Lord Lao, and I will be killed by vengeful ghosts.</p>
<p>Two days pass quickly, or perhaps they pass very slowly! The last pinch of roasted rice smells strangely fragrant. This time I am truly uneasy —— the roasted rice is gone!</p>
<p>Several more days pass in succession, and my stomach is truly feeling it.</p>
<p>The mountains at night are eerily silent, so silent that I can hear the trembling of my uneasy heart! —— A heart that is beating so rapidly!</p>
<p>My salivary glands turn sour, and yellow fluid rushes up. I vomit it out with a "wah!" My stomach is almost inflamed from the friction.</p>
<p>The desire for invisibility, earth escape, and cloud riding slowly recedes, and what unfolds in my mind is a picture of stark reality.</p>
<p>Carrying six liters of roasted rice in a burlap sack —— the only six liters of rice left in the house! Taking a change of clothes, and holding a incense tray in my hand, I stubbornly bid farewell to my home —— to go to Maoshan to learn the Tao!</p>
<p>Tears fell one after another, forming a string, and my wife sobbed. My son grabbed my hand, calling "Papa, Papa," crying, and jumping. But my heart was as firm as iron —— can a person learning the Tao still be attached to worldly emotions?</p>
<p>Now things are different, and my heart is not so strong anymore —— perhaps hunger has driven away the Supreme Lord Lao? I am regretting that I came to this remote mountain range where there is nothing to see. Should I go back? My feet feel a bit off!</p>
<p>The sun bites through the thin layer of clouds at the top of the eastern treetops, and the earth begins to come alive again. My mind becomes clearer:</p>
<p>"Has the landlord come to demand the rent?"</p>
<p>"After I took the only six liters of rice, what will they eat?"</p>
<p>"Go back!" I struggle mightily, but before I can sit up, I vomit several more mouthfuls of yellow fluid, sour and bitter.</p>
<p>The light slowly fades from my eyes, my ears are ringing, and my trembling heart is about to rest! —— "Maoshan?" I open my eyes for the last time.</p>
<h3>A Night of Bitter North Wind</h3>
<p>— Yi'an</p>
<h3>Indulgence and Enjoyment</h3>
<p>— Jia Chen</p>
<p>People are really not as solid as iron and steel, working day and night without rest like machines, impervious to wear and tear. Therefore, everyone should have two sides to their life, work and recreation. After finishing the tasks that need to be done every day, there must be time to rest. This rest itself is a kind of liberation, a liberation from mental fatigue, and a restoration of inherent strength. Therefore, the existence of recreation among people is as important and indispensable as work. That is to say, people must work, and they must also have recreation. The true meaning of recreation lies in enjoyment. In other words, people have the toil of work, so they should also have the enjoyment of recreation. Proper recreation is a right that everyone should have. However, people generally have a common innate laziness, like inertia in physics, which does not move unless pushed, and if left to stop, it will stop forever. People are the same, and even more so, they fear toil and indulge in ease and comfort, often abandoning proper work because of recreation. If all the time is completely consumed in recreation, there is no more talk of work or not. When it comes to such a state, recreation can no longer be considered enjoyment, but has become a behavior of indulgence. Therefore, in certain situations, the enjoyment of recreation must have appropriate restrictions. If it exceeds the appropriate limit, it is a manifestation of indulgence. Once indulged, not only is the true meaning of enjoyment immediately lost, but it also becomes a fall from grace.</p>
<p>Everything in the world, everything, has no absolute necessity. What is called good is not necessarily good, and what is called evil is not necessarily evil. Good may contain elements of evil, and evil may contain elements of good. The matter of recreation is no different and possesses the same principle.</p>
<p>Therefore, the true meaning of recreation, no matter which aspect it belongs to, can only be appreciated by those who can truly enjoy it. But for another group of people——those who do not separate indulgence and enjoyment——the true meaning of recreation's enjoyment can never be felt, and instead it becomes something harmful and useless. But in fact, it is not easy to find people who truly understand that enjoyment is enjoyment and indulgence is indulgence, and who can always stop at enjoyment without falling into indulgence. On the contrary, there are many who, due to a lack of understanding of enjoyment, often unknowingly fall into indulgence through enjoyment. There is no other reason for this than the inherent, deeply rooted nature of people to greedily seek comfort. And generally speaking, people who live in special and privileged circles and indulge in recreation that is not enjoyment are particularly common. Why? Because they have too much free time and too little to do——these people have become completely devoted to the pursuit of material desires and sensory pleasures, with no mental rest or enjoyment. Conversely, those who are busy more often and have less free time will naturally cherish the enjoyment of recreation even more, feel the preciousness of enjoyment, and use it carefully. Therefore, it can be said that the busier people are, the more they appreciate the value of enjoying recreation. The more idle people are, the less real enjoyment they can have, because their spirit's heavy demands require enjoyment for liberation, and they have already fallen into indulgence. What enjoyment is there to talk about? Therefore, the fallen are the most numerous of this kind.</p>
<h3>Old Li</h3>
<p>— A Ping</p>
<p>This lonely, suffering old man, Old Li, has not been in my mind for several years. Yesterday, a friend from the countryside mentioned that Old Li had died. In this day and age, the death of an Old Li is naturally insignificant, but it seems too miserable that it took two days after his death for the village chief to go door-to-door to collect money to buy a coffin and prepare him for burial.</p>
<p>Old Li was lonely. He had no wife. He had a so-called adopted son who helped him with the ferry crossing at the mouth of the San Yi River. The only property he had was this dilapidated boat that needed to be hauled ashore twice a year.</p>
<p>Some things in the countryside are easier to handle than in the city. For example, Old Li set up this ferry crossing even though he was not a native of this village and he did not greet the influential village chief here. He lived here because of the favorable location and the support of the people. Now, there may not be one or two people in this village who can tell you about his origins.</p>
<p>Originally, there was a stone bridge two miles away that could be used to get to the market, but since Old Li set up this ferry crossing, everyone was willing to take the shorter route and pay one copper coin each time for the ferry ride. They were grateful to Old Li for giving them so much convenience.</p>
<p>Gradually, he became familiar with the people of this village. Because he saved every penny, he built a thatched hut at the ferry crossing. He and his son moved the bedding from the cabin and considered it a home.</p>
<p>At this time, I was probably six or seven years old. Every day I ran to the ferry crossing. Although Old Li was already forty years old, he liked to play with us, so more and more children gathered at the ferry crossing. When he was free, he would tell us about the Classic of Mountains and Seas, often</p>

<h3>Dancing is a Shortcut to Becoming a Movie Star (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Xuan Qing</p>
<p>Perseverance and Hard Work are Essential for Success</p>
<p>Understanding One Thing Can Lead to Understanding Many</p>
<p>"What Mark Siebel said is: for example, when you drive a car, you don't just start at full speed. That's impossible. You must slowly start in first gear, go a few steps, then shift to second gear, go a few more steps, then shift to third gear, and then you can drive smoothly and quickly without obstruction. You must do the same when you start the engine of your own body. In the morning, take a walk outdoors, or indoors. Start slowly, then gradually increase the speed until you are walking fast, then slowly slow down again, until you are walking at a normal pace. That way, you won't be out of breath, and the machinery of your body can run smoothly."</p>
<p>"Then you need to know how to restore your strength - in a very short time. Boxers only need a minute to restore their strength. You must learn this, just like you learn other things. Sit down, lean your head back, close your eyes, stretch your legs, and let your hands hang loosely by your sides. Force yourself to do this for five minutes, removing all thoughts from your mind. If you do this every day, you will eventually know that sitting quietly and relaxing is the only way to quickly restore your strength. I think that one day, dancers will adopt the methods of boxers to train themselves. This method is more important to the dancer's face than to their dancing. We must have beautiful women in the songs and dances on the screen, but, you may not believe it, a dancer chosen this year may be useless next year. The reason? The body, the face, everything changes greatly within a year. That is also difficult to prevent, unless the dancers, like boxers, practice constantly every day. That is certainly not pleasant to hear, but it is definitely necessary, especially in the film industry, because on the stage, one or two more lines on a woman's face are not very important, but one or two more lines in front of the camera is suicide."</p>
<p>"There is one more thing, which sounds like bad news, but I never deceive people. The age limit for women to be selected for musical comedies is usually set at twenty-one. But this age limit is very helpful to many ordinary dancers, because many aspiring dancers know that their age limit is approaching, so they try their best to draw people's attention to the progress of their performing arts, and not just to dancing. But this does not mean that you can stop learning to dance once you are over twenty years old. What I am saying is that if you want to make dancing your profession, you must start early, but many stars use dancing to assist the development of their talent. They have certainly benefited from dancing. Ginger Rogers was a dancer when she first appeared on stage. When she entered the film industry, she was a comedian, and she didn't dance until she made a song and dance film with Fred Astaire. Fred thought she was the easiest woman in the world to teach because she knew music and rhythm by nature. Now she has become Fred Astaire's partner. There are countless other stars who, after twenty, or after becoming famous, suddenly discovered their own dance talent and further assisted their progress. Finally, dancing is like anything else. It is only through perseverance and hard work that you can achieve success. If you can learn everything mentioned above from the small path of dancing, and then apply it to other things, then you can say: 'Nothing in the world is impossible'." (The End)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "Charlie Chan in London"</h3>
<p>— Stone Axe</p>
<p>Charlie Chan in London</p>
<p>—Grand Shanghai Theater—</p>
<p>Using words like "wrongful imprisonment" in a film title is certainly very novel. The original meaning of this title is "Charlie Chan in London," which is similar to the original meaning of "The Return of Bulldog Drummond" being "Mist Over the Corpse." Perhaps this is also the difficulty of naming detective films.</p>
<p>This time, it is said that Charlie Chan went to London on business and happened to encounter a wrongful case, so he took on the investigation and ultimately overturned the wrongful imprisonment.</p>
<p>The beginning of the story narrates that Gray was imprisoned as a suspect, and it just so happened that Charlie Chan arrived at this time. It seems a bit clumsy, but it is not uneconomical because it allows many opportunities for "the performance of the play."</p>
<p>Needless to say, detective films use the same old tricks of "deliberately creating suspense" and "feinting to the east and attacking in the west" to achieve a sudden result, so in addition to the housekeeper Philip (who was later discovered to be a detective), people like Gordon Howard all have "embarrassed faces," and even the groom reveals the appearance of a "murderous villain," while the real murderer, Leslie, has a "face full of smiles," making people deeply believe in his innocence.</p>
<p>Warner Oland's Charlie Chan has the qualifications of a living Guan Gong like San Mazi, and the Chinese people he portrays are everywhere "leisurely," "insidious," and "inferior." If there was no original work explaining Charlie's personality as "sincere," "refined," and "philosophical," then Mr. Warner's pair of dull eyes would certainly have described the Chinese as not being a thing.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the case, Charlie found a diamond ring belonging to Pamela and kept it until the end to return it to her, saying, "This is the complete closure of the case," which is a good chapter. Clive's three-way headhunter constantly recorded the key points that Charlie said, and later even wrote down his teasing remarks, which is laughable. This man played a patrolman in "Mist Over the Corpse," which shows that he is an indispensable supporting character in detective films.</p>
<p>Charlie Chan's films always have such a style: they won't make you "marvel at the case" nor will they make you "feel dispirited." However, it is always better to have fewer of Warner Oland's works! In the minds of Americans, I am afraid that there are many misleading places.</p>
<h3>Review of "The Defense Rests"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Defense Rests—Cathay</p>
<p>There are many old-fashioned film writers who have seen the dark side of society to some extent, and they themselves also express great dissatisfaction with these dark sides. However, they cannot go further and explore the social basis of such dark sides from an economic perspective. Therefore, they have no way to analyze it, let alone understand how to completely solve the problem by reforming the economic system. As a result, they place these sins on certain groups of people, and in their artistic works, they reflect the moral concepts of the author and use their conscience to punish the people they want to punish, or to make those evildoers repent, reform, and do good. Naturally, we believe that this concept is incorrect, although they also talk about the conscience of art.</p>
<p>There are indeed many films about this concept, and now we have seen "The Defense Rests." In this film, the screenwriter seems to have an appreciation for the law. He says through the mouth of a lawyer that the task of the law is to make criminals suffer, and the task of the lawyer is to acquit the defendant. Thus, that lawyer, relying on his talent and eloquence, acquitted the suspected murderer on the pretext of "self-defense," so the real murderer remained at large. In addition, this lawyer also defended a kidnapper, and as a result, the family of the kidnapped (an old woman) committed suicide in the lawyer's office in anger. The latter caused the lawyer to feel a very heavy pang of conscience, and with the persuasion of others, he immediately repented and severed ties with the villains. Here, the screenwriter expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that the law is being used as a toy by criminals, but his solution is only to use conscience to persuade that kind of illegal lawyer. As for the law itself, it will naturally not give the slightest criticism, which is clearly illustrated by the fact that the villains eventually submit to the law.</p>
<p>Like such a story, we cannot but think that it is very dramatic, but under the clumsy handling of the director, it makes us feel extremely dull. Those conversations, coupled with the female lead's acting skills being too unskilled, in technical terms, there is no denying that it was unsuccessful.</p>

<h3>Black-Faced Compassion (Imitation of Life) (8)</h3>
<p>— Text Imprint</p>
<p>During the days that Delilah and Beth were looking for Fiorella, Stephen accompanied Jessie out to play every day. They went to a new place every night. He was originally an ichthyologist, and he explained all kinds of fish to her in detail. Soon the two of them became very good friends. However, good things are often fraught with difficulties, and their friendship was ruined by Jessie, who had actually fallen in love with Stephen. Jessie told him that on the afternoon Beth came home. At that time, Stephen was about to leave his dwelling to see Beth when Jessie suddenly came. With her half-child, half-adult eyes, she looked at Stephen's face and said, "Stephen, I love you." Stephen was unprepared and was taken aback when he heard Jessie's words. He said, "Jessie... my dear." Jessie said: "Really, I love you." Her sincere voice showed that her words came from the heart. Stephen couldn't help but say, "You shouldn't joke with your elders. I know the temperament of you female students. You almost scared me just now." Jessie said, "I originally wanted to go to various places with you... those were the happiest times of my life... but it was all a fantasy... you treat me like a child... oh, Stephen... kiss me..." She pursed her trembling little lips, but Stephen did not kiss her lips, but smoothed her hair with his hand and said slowly, "Jessie, you don't understand what you are saying. You don't understand what love is." When Jessie heard this, she pushed Stephen away frantically and shouted, "Oh, don't I understand?" As she said this, she burst into tears and ran out of the house.</p>
<p>In the evening, just before dinner, Beth mentioned their marriage plan during the conversation. Stephen stood silently, secretly feeling sad for Jessie. When Jessie heard her mother's words, she felt a pain like a knife piercing her heart, and tears welled up involuntarily. Beth saw it, put her arm around her daughter and asked, "Baby, what's wrong?" Jessie shook her head and ran upstairs. Beth followed her up. Jessie later restrained her sadness and did not tell her mother her secret. She went downstairs again to congratulate Stephen, but her head was hanging down and she couldn't lift it up for a while. That night, they discussed going to a fashionable place for dinner to celebrate their engagement. But just as they were about to go out, a maid rushed in and said, "Miss Beth... come quickly... something bad has happened... Delilah... I saw her lying on the ground." When Beth heard this, she immediately ran to Delilah's room and walked to her bedside. When Delilah saw Beth, she said, "Miss Beth, I don't want to live anymore." Beth said, "It's okay. I'm here with you. Delilah... what do you want, tell me..." Delilah said, "Miss, thank you. I want you to bury me properly... I want a military band to send me to see God..." ...After everything was over, when Beth had time to think about her own life and Stephen's life, she suddenly realized that Jessie had changed. That thought, like lightning, went straight to her heart. Jessie and Stephen had fallen in love! She initially felt a great shock, but later, she gradually realized that her marriage to Stephen would never be completely successful. And looking at Delilah's appearance, she knew that if she married Stephen, the relationship between her and her daughter would definitely not be as close and harmonious as before. She told herself that it must not be so, no matter what, she would not sacrifice any small part of Jessie's happiness for her own happiness... Her own life was built around Jessie, and for Jessie, she had worked, strived, and sacrificed half of her life. So she euphemistically told Stephen. Although Jessie begged her to marry Stephen, she had made up her mind and would not be shaken at all. She said, "Jessie, my baby. You are more important than anything. Your happiness is above everything else. Let's go abroad together." (The End)</p>
