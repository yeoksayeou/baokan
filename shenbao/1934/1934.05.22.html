<p>（南京）今日本部召集第二次全國財政會議開會、承中央黨部國府代表汪院長蒞會訓詞、各處代表各專家各省市財政重要人員、遠道來京出席、集羣彥於一堂作通盤之籌計、祥煕謹以至誠、先致榮幸及歡迎之意、十七年七月本部曾召集第一次全國財政會議、其時全國統一未久、軍事甫經吿終、訓政正待開始、全國上下望治之心甚切、當時工作實注意於財政之整理、滿擬逐漸實行决議、由整理而進於建設、不意六年以來、天災人禍、紛至沓來、荒歉頻仍、匪共滋蔓、最近三年、更加以國難之嚴重、世界經濟之恐慌、國家社會遂處於風雨飄搖之境、差幸整理工作、頼同人之努力、雖無顯著成績、巳有軌轍可循、惟社會經濟日就凋殘、農民因　賤稅重、勤勞所入、不足資生、工商則因遭不景之怒潮、日形衰落、而入超與年俱增、昔時所患在財政之紊亂、今則益之以枯涸、紊亂尙待整理、枯涸尤須救濟、皆有待於兼營並顧、</p>
<p>財政爲國家命脈、正如血液之於人身、必須全部流通、始有健全之體力、倘一段一節、各自爲謀、勢必偏枯而至僵仆、今日而言救濟、舍竭力培養民力、實無以保垂絶之生機、欲圖農村之復興、市塲之繁榮、必先使人民於安居樂業、軍事當局、現正致全力於匪共之淸剿、財政方面、亟宜觸滅人民之負担、以期共直接所受之痛苦、得漸解除、本年一月四中全會、祥煕爰有整理田賦滅輕附加之提議、大會議决通過、中政會議送行政院交財政部執行、惟茲事體大、必賴羣力以策進行、且尤有待於地方當局、各就當地實情、酌議實施方案、財政經緯、萬端、非一手一足之力可舉、値此民生凋敝、國難危急之際、規畫興復、端緒繁多、緩急輕重、尤當審量、益以今日之中國而言、整理財政、其應商榷者至繁、而所當注重者尤在下列諸問題、</p>
<p>㈠滅輕田賦附加、究應如何另籌抵補、始能稍紓民困、無妨建設、</p>
<p>㈡廢除苛捐雜稅究應舉辦何種良稅另謀開源、</p>
<p>㈢稅制應如何改良、使人民負擔公平、不致畸重畸輕之弊、</p>
<p>㈣地方預算基礎應如何確定、以謀收支適合、</p>
<p>㈤全國收支應如何統籌、方能酌盈劑虚、以免各地方苦樂不均、</p>
<p>㈥行政費與事業費、應如何妥定比率、方使欵不虚糜事無偏廢、</p>
<p>㈦經征人員應如何確定保障、及奬懲辦法以裕稅收、</p>
<p>㈧幣制應如何整理、始能便利人民、安定市面、</p>
<p>㈨金融應如何流通、游資應如何利用、俾得扶助生產事業、</p>
<p>㈩中國立國以農爲本、現在農村經濟已瀕破產、應如何設法救濟、以輔助農民增加生產、以謀農業之復興富源之開拓、</p>
<p>㈩㈠工商日趨衰微應如何設法奬勵國貨、扶植生產、以减少漏巵、謀經濟之發展、　　㈩㈡關於地方保衛交通敎育諸政、應如何利用自治自衛之能力、以謀减輕經費支出、及租稅附加之負擔、</p>
<p>㈩㈢新生活運動應如何推行、以崇節儉而養廉潔、</p>
<p>㈩㈣中央與地方應如何内外相維、共圖發展、</p>
<p>以上所舉不過犖犖大者、當亟謀解决之方、而田賦之整理、負擔之平均、地方預算之確定、稅源之開闢、幣制之改策、尤爲當務之急、有待於集思廣益、悉心規畫、歷年租賦加重、在各市省地方、舊辦新政、用途重要、原不不得已苦衷、中央固所深悉、惟揆諸民力、實已不勝、奮然革除、實同義士之斷腕、蓋减免附加以蘇民困、雖於地方收入有損、而整頓稅收、開發生產、培養稅源諸端、苟能切實行之、以增加收入、未始不足以資抵補也、中央與地方原屬一體、休戚相關、原無畛域可分、當此危急之秋、尤賴於精誠團結、以度難關、故近年以來、中央財政雖極感困難、於地方苟有萬有得已之需、仍必於萬無可設法之中、勉力補助、如最近贛省以匪區漸復、農村亟待復興、爰由蔣委員長熊主席、就商汪院長及祥煕、决定豁免全省苛捐雜稅、其不足欵、由部恊濟、然此不過一時之計、實非根本之圖、欲謀根本解决、自當開生產之源、節浮濫之用、其樞紐尤在於確定預算、必中央於地方收支實况、澈底明瞭、乃得支配適當、措施裕如、此則中央與地方所應交相策勵者也、</p>
<p>吾國財政自來所以不振、積弊所以難革者、厥有三因、一榷吏營私舞弊藉飽私　、二建設不審緩急、用度無節、三當官奢侈成性、濫費公欵、故國家取之於民者、雖不爲少、而展轉剝削、弊藏無多、國困民貧、端基於此、弊源所在、各稅收人員、任事日久、非不深知、而隠忍不言、無非以多端顧忌、曲予瞻庇、畢宣底藴、不便私圖、須知政府値危急之際、圖挽救之方、卽在全國財政、悉入正軌、財政不入正軌、庶政無可興辦、庶政無可辦、國家尙何興復之可方、革命必先革心、必公務員痛除積習、悉除舊染、而後足言興利除弊、潔已奉公、	否則討論結果、雖有具體方案、議而不行、行而不力、亦託諸空言而已、此則所望於全國公務員之有深切覺悟者也、</p>
<p>現在國難嚴重、而世界不景氣潮流、已波及吾國、各國以經濟恐慌、自救不暇、吾國生產落後、經濟衰落、如不速謀挽救之方、是目速於危亡之地、目下切要之圖、尤在於政府與人民努力合作、人民旣須於徵收官吏、嚴加監察、以免其舞弊自肥、尤當深明納稅義務、並努力生產、以裕稅源、上下一心、共圖挽救、庶幾國計民生可裕、而來日危難、亦可消免於無形、此則所望於國民有深切認識者也、</p>
<p>總之、此次全國財政會議之召集、不僅討論整理財政而於民生之榮瘁、國家之休戚、尤息息相關、深望諸君念總理創造民國之艱難、及我炎黃祖宗留遺基業之不易、當前處境之危險、責任之在於吾人者、至重且大、必須本克己犧牲之精神、有深切著明之認識、官民内外、打成一片、同心恊力、以挽此垂危之局、財政爲國家命脈、血脈必須流通、前已具言之、人之患貧血或血中有毒、必弱且病、今日吾國卽患斯症、諸君來此、卽專爲國家淸血輸血之工作、然不痛除爲己自私之心、則國家仍無可救、蓋此次會議、雖爲救濟財政、其實卽爲救濟國家、救濟人民、換言之、卽可謂爲救亡會議、各專家各省市代表各省市財政人員、務旣深知國有値非常國難之時、當痛念國而忘家公而忘私之義、共加討究、以濟艱難、不爲高遠不切之言、不爲空虚無實之論、言皆有物、起而可行、庶以循序漸進之方、收抒難扶危之效、此則祥煕所企禱者也、義賢在望、佇拜嘉言、</p>

<h3 id="c5">汪院長致訓詞 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>（南京）汪院長在財政會議訓詞云、今日財政會議開會、有重大意義、而在這國難期間開會更有重大意義、現在財政上負責的人、都感到一種矛盾的痛苦、一方面須向人民籌欵、一方面人民又已無出錢的能力、這種矛盾、很難找出解决方法、我中國自古以農立國、爲政者只要做到「政簡刑淸輕徵薄賦」八字、取之於民的要少、而替百姓做事亦不必多、自從中外交通以後、局勢大變、各國的農工商業高度發達、激烈競爭、中國處在這國際環境之中、取之於民、用之於民的、都非以前可比、試觀軍事上建造一砲艦、卽須費數千萬數萬萬軍費、如此其他都是一樣、又比如就交通上言、外國運兵到中國、有極快的兵艦、中國據我們過去的經騐、由江西運一兩師兵到上海、亦要二三十天之多、如何能免援師不濟之虞、但是建築鐵路公路又需鉅欵、我們如果還是用「政簡刑淸輕徵薄賦」八個字做標準、我們國家也就不能存在了、兄弟知道、在中央以及地方服務的人、都感覺到中國對於現代國家所需的條件太缺乏、不能不盡力設法急起直追、而事實上財政的困難、經濟的竭蹶、又使人無從去措手、據海關的報吿、去年入超有六萬萬之多、老百姓吃的要外國的米和　粉、老百姓穿的要外國棉花棉紗、差不多我們生活一切所需要、都要靠外國、他們資本雄厚、可以薄利多賣、我們資本微薄、如何能與支持、一切農工商業都不能和人家競爭、農村已經十分凋敝、社會巳經十分窮困、現在老百姓正是需要救濟的時候、如果我們再向老百姓去徵捐稅、榨取老百姓的脂膏、實在是於心不忍、所以中央和地方一樣、一面要找錢、一面又不能多向老百姓要錢、這種矛盾現象、就成爲我們財政上的痛苦、至於解决的方法、剛才孔副院長已經說過許多、兄弟不能再說、不過在這國難最重國民經濟又臨破產的時候、消極上人民盼望政府的救濟、盼望整理捐稅甚切、積極上政府應做的生產建設的工作又極多、這個財政問題捐稅問題、是非解决不可的、要是無法解决便只有滅亡、故此次財政會議不僅是財政問題、實在是關於國家民族生命的問題、希望中央地方各代表專家、在這幾天會議中間、各本其學問經騐、謀得妥當的辦法、這個辦法就是中國財政的生路、也是中國民族的生路、（二十一日專電）</p>
<h3 id="c6">國府代表致詞 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>（南京）國府代表鄧家彥訓詞云、今所欲言者、爲孟子所說、「桀紂之失天下也失其民也、失其心也、得天下有道、得其民、斯得天下矣、得其民有道、得其心斯得其民矣、得其心有道、所欲與之聚之、所惡勿施爾也」、實爲吾人最好之敎訓、總理之民生主義、亦以解除人民經濟之壓迫爲中心、今田賦附加、超過正供有至十餘倍者、此外尙有苛捐雜稅、人民負擔之重、可以想見、希望本會議中、求一切實解决方法、並將所有决議案、確切施行、「爲政不在多言、在實施如何耳」、此尤當貢獻於在座諸位也、（二十一日專電）</p>
<h3 id="c7">張壽鏞之演詞 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>（南京）財政會議開幕時專家會員張壽鏞致詞、略謂現在國難方殷、經濟幾瀕破產、適汪院長說海關入超每年達六萬萬元、對於這種危機、應如何渡過、不可不詳加研究、中國以農立國、但近年來農村將至總崩潰的時期、今春壽鏞因事回鄕、曾與一般農民談話、據農民說、完租以後反要虧累、中國大農少小農多、因爲工價貴米價賤、又加以賦重、這是農村破產一大原因、此次財政會議、到各省市代表和專家相聚一堂、共同討論、對於今後中國財政、定能想出補救辦法、同時在國際上亦爭一口氣、壽鏞今以公民資格、希望中央及地方諸先生下一决心、最低限度、自今日起永不加賦、至於以前附加過重或定一遞减之辦法、並希望苛細捐稅、立卽罷除云云、（二十一日中央社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3 id="c10">瀕於破裂之軍縮會議 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>— 恒</p>
<p>日内瓦軍縮會議委員會雖仍有於本月二十九集會之說。然其成功希望顯巳埀盡一則德國最近發表之軍備預算。已超越凡爾賽和約所許之限</p>
<p>國亦覺軍縮會議行將失敗故亟於國防之充實由此三端。足見軍縮會議之運命不絶如縷其死刑之宣判僅一時日问題而巳。</p>
<p>今姑舍此片段之現象而言根本之癥結則軍縮之不能有成尤爲昭著。蓋國際和平必以親善爲基、礎而親善之獲得又必以公平爲條件。否則卽難免不使舊恨新仇輾轉孳生和平美名徒成泡影或者不察顚倒因果。以爲軍縮苟成則和平可保殊不知不具備和平之要素與條件而高唱軍縮非愚則誣耳故由軍縮而求和平直舍本逐末之舉軍縮之所以無成謂非。各國缺乏誠意不可得也。</p>
<p>方歐戰之進行也協約各國稱之爲「弭戰之戰」意謂此後可以一勞永逸不復有干戈之苦戰事旣停宜不以凡爾賽和約之桎梏加諸德國。旣訂約矣尤不當蔑視該約普遍裁軍之明文使德國獨受委屈。不謂協約各國凱歌未奏故態巳萌處分未來戰利品之秘密密約層出不窮如剖割戰敗國之土地勒索戰敗國之賠欵以及限制戰敗國之軍備無所不用極。此其不能獲得戰敗國之善意又何待言故凡爾賽和約簽訂之日。亦卽下屆大戰播種之時。</p>
<p>再者軍縮之與國聯原有不可分離之關係軍縮能成。自足增加國聯之聲勢然亦必先有强有力之國聯然後始能以其聲望促軍縮之圓成。特自九一八以來國聯之軟弱無能業巳暴露無遺日本所以敢悍然退出國聯。德國所以敢步武日本後塵皆爲看透此一弱點之結果雖謂今日軍縮失敗之朕兆。再見於日本侵我東北之初亦無不可也。</p>
<p>至於直接之原因則自爲德國希脫拉之崛起。一九三二年十二月英美法德意等五國、簽訂所謂承認德國軍備地位平等原則之議定書翌年三月十六之英國新草案復許德國於八年内設置陸軍二十萬人卽法國之態度。似亦頗有廻旋餘地惟至希氏登臺而後厲行其對外積極政策。於是深遭法國之忌至去冬德國退出國聯軍縮會議本已陷於絶境。其所以尙具一線之希望者蓋以英國從中幹旋使法德雙方會外交涉以求妥恊耳。不意德國發表新預算明目張胆增加軍費致使法國有拒絶與德更作談判之表示。會議之一綫生機至是乃希氏之强硬態度所斷送良可慨也。</p>
<p>心否認德國更有軍備平等之權利法國對德之惶恐與其自身这孤立。亦由是而反映無遺蓋法國今日一旦與德發生戰爭其在國外所獲之援助。必遠不如一九一四年之時其可預方者卽英國此後對於法德之戰。除相當維持洛卡諾條約下之義務外將盡量採取中立態度。觀其欲與巴黎政府訂立空軍公約卽可知其忌法之心亦不小也至於戰後之意大利。向與法國利害衝突將來雖不能謂必至助德以攻法然坐觀成敗以收漁利要爲難免。法人所可賴爲聲援者惟有小恊約然奥匈旣爲意國所操縱。小恊約復受奥匈之牽制小恊約之實幾何實堪疑問反之以德國機器工業之發達。民族意志之堅强尙武精神之普遍整軍備武當不甚難卽以人口論亦遠勝於法。聞一九三六年至一九四○年間法國戰鬥員之人數將僅及上屆大單戰爆發時之半。僅此一端亦足使其感覺重大之威脅矣。</p>
<p>總之由今日國聯召集之軍縮會議已屆壽終正寢之階段而後。歐陸風雲自將益形險惡英國政策不論傾向何方抑或維持中立。要以急謀自保爲方針固可斷言影響所及或足使英人改變對於遠東問題之認識。亦未可知此我國人所應深切注意而善自爲謀者也。</p>

<p>去歲錠數雖增、營業則仍趨衰落、政府與紗業疊次會議、以謀補救、自四月二十二日起、一致减工、其目的並非藉此抬高紗價、實以紗價低廉、滯銷如故、存紗增多、資金積擱、有無法周轉之勢、故减工以减低產量、俾維持血本、後因顧全工人生計、及地方治安、復陸續復工、在自由停工期中、完全停工者、凡十二廠、計紡錠四二六·六八八枚、全停夜工者四廠、計紡錠九七·二八八枚、總計全國减率、在百分之二十三左右、生產仍苦過剩、故自七月七日起、又有停止夜工之舉、去歲上半年、停錠逾總數之半、下半年停錠亦逾百萬枚、减工之甚、可以想見、</p>

<p>遇雷雨風霧致觸碾子礁</p>
<p>損失十萬乘客船員無恚</p>
<p>法租界新開河麵粉交易所五樓、東港合記輪船公司之天象號輪船、於前日（二十日）晨四時許、在温州洋面北天銅頭山附近、遇颶風雷雨、致觸礁沉没、幸船員乘客等均無恙、茲將調查所得情形錄後、</p>
<p>（中途遇雷雨霧）天象輪原名勝利、後歸東港公司、改名東港、詎東港公司虧蝕、因由債權人趙仰夫君等將公司改組、加添合記字樣、而船亦改用天象之名、該船儎重八百噸、年齡尙輕、行駛於滬閩間、於本月九日、自滬裝儎客貨、開往泉州厦門、起卸後、十六日由厦赴瑞安、裝儎柴炭雜貨來滬、於二十日晨一時許、由瑞安出口來滬、於四時許、行經温州口外洋面銅頭山附近、忽遇颶風、雷雨交作、海面並有大霧、以致頓失駕駛能力、全船驚慌、一霎那間、船身遂在碾子礁觸礁出事、</p>
<p>（船沉前之布置）船主賀聖揚、大副胡全興、見船身觸礁石、船底洞穿、海水侵入、全船驚擾、幸船主慰吿稍安勿躁、至天將微明風浪略小、乃將船上所備舢舨放下、先使乘客船員等離船、買辦楊芝庭亦隨舢舨上山、斯時附近漁船亦來助救、船主直至全船下沉時、不得已始離船登山、船員乘客到甌、該輪全船船員共五十八人、乘客若干未悉、紛乘自備舢舨、及來助漁船、脫險上山、該山卽銅頭山、在温州口外約三四十哩、距瑞安約八九十哩、登山後天已大明、見船尾全沉海底、駕駛間尙能望見、至落水時船頭昻起約三尺、買辦楊芝庭雇漁船、先率船員二十三人赴温州、旣而船主乘客等亦到、卽投四明公所暫息、一面電吿滬行、該輪此次雖遭世險、而乘客船員無恙、可稱不幸中之幸矣、</p>
<p>（保險與兩電文）本埠東港合記公司、於前晚（二十日）十二時接買辦第一電吿、於昨日下午一時又接第二電報、該輪事前曾向愛多亞路一百六十號中國船舶聯合保險公司、保有平安險三萬元、故接失事報吿後、該公司卽將原電抄送保險公司、正式通知、保險公司以電碼不明、函復俟船長報吿到後、再行核辦、據東港合記公司經理趙仰夫君云、沉船善後事宜、須待保險公司解决、刻下尙無辦法、而此次損失當在十萬元之譜、茲將兩電錄下、第一電云、象（卽天象）哿（二十日）晨一時、瑞開、至四時在北天銅頭山礁觸、後尾沉没、船員及客無恙、船員二十三僱漁船到甌、其餘在山上及艙面、候小船設法、本船如何辦法、速復、温州四明公所楊（芝庭）、第二電云、象哿晨四時十分、甌山盤遇雷雨風霧、暗潮急、獨碾子礁、潮漲、見駕駛間、潮落、見船頭三尺、員客甌轉滬云、</p>

<p>我國上海烟台大沽間、現有沿海水綫二條、卽著名之滬烟沽水綫、該兩水綫、均係我國所有、惟其中上海至烟台水綫一條、及烟台至大沽水綫兩條、因係外商大北大東兩電報公司墊欵敷設、曾經由我國以前電政主管機關、與該兩電報公司、訂立合同、委託其代管代辦、交通部茲爲謀電信主權之完整起見、决定於本月二十日、將上述水綫收回自辦、事前已函知大北大東兩公司、將該水綫及一切機件材料傢具等移交、關於接收該水綫之技術、及其他一切事宜、亦經交通部令派駐在上海烟台天津三處之水綫工程師、負責辦理、</p>
<h3 id="c159">代辦經過 <a href="#c159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>上述由大東大北兩公司代辦之滬烟沽水綫、原係該公司等於前淸庚子年時所設、於光緖二十六年間、由我國作價收回、惟仍訂立合同、委託該公司等代管代辦、所需經費、則由我國擔任、此外並准許該公司等在代辦期間、有在上海烟台大沽三處、設立電局、直接收發公衆電報之權、近年以來、交部久有廢止上項合同、俾將水綫收回自管之意、但因種種關係、迄未實現、迨至最近、一切就緒、技術方面之凖備、亦吿完成、交部乃通知公司、定本月二十日實行收回、</p>

<p>此次交部廢除滬烟沽水綫合同、並收回水綫管理權、其意義頗爲重大、蓋滬烟沽水綫、爲我國北方與東南間重要電報綫路之一、其管理之權、旁落他人之手、殊屬非宜、且外國水綫公司、在我國境内、現僅大北大東兩公司、依據上述合同、在烟台設有電局一所、直接向公衆收發電報、尤屬我國電信之缺憾、合同廢除以後、不但水綫收回自管、而且公司等在烟台所設電局、亦同時撤銷、實爲電政史上一極可紀念之事、</p>

<p>大白社記者昨據電局方面負責人談、謂我方自與大北大東兩公司辦理接收手續後、頗形順利、但以時間匆忙、故除將一般之交涉事務結束外、關於接收水綫一項、尙未全部辦淸、且技術上至爲麻煩、而前日復値星期、昨日又逢丹麥紀念日、大北大東兩公司均停止辦公、故水綫之移交、迄未完畢外傳有因某種手續、拒絶移交說、均屬揣測之詞、刻我方發報綫路、暫由交部原有之水綫傳遞、不過收發方面、稍感擁擠耳、但最近一二日内、决可完全接收完畢、</p>

<p>目錄（一）小前言</p>
<p>（二）本週情報</p>
<p>（三）特别播送</p>
<p>（小前言）近來有許多讀者·在來信中·或在談話中往往詢及本部工作範圍以外的問題，譬如，中國的前途怎樣？自己應該怎樣？某某要人如何等等。這些問題都已溢出本部討論範圍、按照本部規約，原是可以不答覆的，但我們每次遇到這類的問題，郤仍不得不稍加解釋，使𤍠心觀察實際問題的讀者不會懷疑我們態度不誠懇，甚至以爲我們　避什麽？但這已是够麻煩了。現在爲消除讀間的隔膜起見，我們還不得不向讀者申說一下。</p>
<p>我們工作的範圍和態度，曾經再四向讀者們言及。我們以極誠懇的並且是客觀的態度，站在研究學問的立塲上，和讀者們携手。無論店員，學徒，凡有志讀書的，我們一律歡迎；無論什麽問題，凡是書本上的，或與書本有密切關聯的，我們均願提出討論。這樣說，自然不是指導讀者去做一個書呆子，如某讀者所云我們做的是造書呆子運動，我們還時時刻刻提示讀者，應該怎樣把理論與實踐配合起來，但我們所做到的，只能以此爲止。爲什麽呢？第一·因爲我們相信，一個對於社會知識有了根基的人，對於目前社會十分關心的人，决不會不明白怎樣處理自己怎樣服務社會的。試問，有一個醉心升官發財的人，而不懂怎樣去找錢的嗎？理論的學習，我們可能盡相當的責任，而怎樣去參加實際，則完全决定於讀者自己，我們不必指示，也不應該主觀的指示，我們最痛心的是世俗的人，慣於利用靑年走自己的道路，其實這是不公正的，我們願意作一個科學者，指示一些科學上的眞理，我們不願作宗敎家去宣傳自己的福音。第二·無論一件事，或一個人都時刻在變化着，發展着的，我們决不能機械地去評價。以前被國人稱頌爲忠臣的人，現在被視作漢奸。所以我們對於某一件事，或一個人應該客觀地從其本身的變化中，從其具體的表現中，去認識其成長和崩潰，並且我們也還不能把某一個人，某一件事當作獨立的存在着，要當作整個社會全體系中的一環看，主觀地機械地說某一個人好，某一件事壞，是最　不過的事，也是最不恰當的事。第三·我們自己本來都是幾個天天拿着書本好的人，並無自信是靑年任何問題的指導者，所以我們不能，也不必强作我們並未預備的答案的必要。這雖然不免引起一部份的𤍠心的讀者大失所望，却自信（忠厚待人）（於心無愧）。研究學問這一點上凡我們可能回答的問題，我們决没有不盡力闡明的，過去是如此，今後仍當如此，我們希望讀者對我們不要作過高的奢望，也不應因此灰心失望。我們以爲我們目前的態度，站在一個敎育者的立塲上，是至爲公正的。</p>
<p>以後凡溢出本部工作範圍以外的問題，無論書面，或面談均不答覆。我們希望大家有個冷靜的頭腦去研究理論，有雙冷靜的眼睛去明察現實。</p>
<p>（本週情報）（一）怎樣自學社便科學，因印刷遲誤，於今日才與讀者相見，已是非常的漸歉了。關於本書定價原估約一角五分，但付排後，因字數加到三萬餘，一角五分到底不敷印刷發行費用，没有辦法，只得改售二角，望讀者特别見諒，初版僅印千五百冊，購者務須從速。總代售處本報特種發行部及本埠各大書店。</p>
<p>（二）本部聲請書與調查表本爲兩紙，現爲簡便起見，已改成一張，望讀者注意。</p>
<p>（三）凡本埠讀者，參加本部手續，請先參加本館借書，取得借書登記證後，再向本部提出聲請登記。</p>
<p>（四）凡外埠本部讀者已獲得本部郵借介紹允許時，本部卽轉知本館郵借部，卽由郵借部負責通知，本部不代收轉，答覆。</p>

<h3 id="c241">遠東體育恊會的蓋棺定論槐 <a href="#c241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>遠東體育恊會之第十屆運動大會、已閉幕矣、最後兩日、例有之常年執委大會席上、日本代表公然提出修改會章、冀促成僞國參加、經大會議决、由三國各派代表一人、另組特别委員會討論之、我人猶以爲此乃會議之習例、所以敷衍了事者、安知事出非常、第二次會議、關係遠東體育恊會存亡之菲律賓代表、突變其以前在滬召開圓桌會議時之中立態度、公然偏護日方、圖謀非法的修改會章、我國代表激於義憤、中途退席、而日菲代表復變本加厲、擅自解散遠東體育恊會、完全不顧向來𤍠力維護遠東大會之我國、另行組織所謂東亞業餘體育恊會者、原因何在、不言而喻、另有作用也、</p>
<p>第十次遠運大會前、日本體育恊會爲欲强拉其帝國主義造成之僞組織參加、派專員赴菲律賓遊說、旋倡議在上海召開中菲日三國圓桌會議討論之、而斯時菲律賓代表談博士之所以嚴守中立、致使會議成爲僵局者、乃爲顧全我國之地位與體面耳、今常年大會席上、菲代表態度之所以突變者、乃預定之步驟耳、</p>
<p>日本提出會章第三條新會員國之加入、須經舊會員國全通過之條文、改爲多數通過、我國當然堅决反對、而菲律賓代表亦假施孤媚、同情於我國、殊不知其一方面復同情日本、對於非會員國之亦可以參加錦標比賽、菲旣同情日本於此條會章之修改、乃第三條會章已不生效力也明矣、如此、僞組織卽使不加入遠東體育恊會、爲正式會員、亦可以參加正式比賽矣、更以目前遠東的政治形勢觀之、菲律賓宣布獨立後的關係觀之、此次菲律賓代表之態度、絶對受另一背景之指使、所以不惜出此斷然之手段也、亦彰彰明矣、</p>
<p>遠東運動會雖有二十年之歷史、但於組織上向無明文之規定、全憑運動上君子的精神爲惟一之信條、直至一九三○年五月在東京舉行第九屆遠運大會時、始有現有正式會章之訂立、其原因由於一九二九年高麗曾一度有要求加入之空氣、而日本爲防止高麗之加入、非特必須訂明章程、且特别注意新會員國之加入、必須經全體舊會員國之通過而後可、今高麗之欲加入、事實已不可能、不意僞組織崛起、日本遂又不顧一切、謀推翻以前自己提議訂立之條文、遂形成今日遠東體恊會之極大波澜、出爾反爾、原屬一人、其手段之毒辣、用心之卑鄙、昭然若揭矣、</p>
<p>再者、荷屬印度及越南二國、已正式參加爲會員、卽使會章之修改、祇須多數會員之通過但荷印越南代表、均未出席、聲明棄權、我國旣經反對、日菲雖已同意、亦僅二國、此於公理上及修改會章之精神上、完全不合、是則以少數壓迫多數耳、待我國代表義憤退席後、日菲代表竟不顧已往一十年和衷共濟的精神、决然謀解散遠東體育恊會、另行非法組織所謂東亞業餘體育恊會者、拒遠運會發起國之我國於千里之外、並以客觀的態度、邀請我國及僞國參加、斯而可忍、孰不可忍、總而言之、日本爲破壞遠東體恊會之劊子手、菲律賓爲其監斬官、精神何存、公理何在、日菲旣不惜破壞二十年來和衷共濟極力維護之遠運大會、我國復何必再迷信運動道德之信條、斷然退出可矣、</p>

<p>第十屆遠東運動大會總評吳鐵城題</p>
<h3 id="c262">回顧前瞻潘公展 <a href="#c262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>有健全之國民、然後有健全之國家、體育爲敎育之一、所以鍛練國民、使有健全之體魄者、敎育而不及體育、則其所敎者、與建築高樓大厦於泥沙之上相等、運動會者、卽所以檢查國民體育之一法、於勝負成敗之外、兼以養成合作團結之精神、勇敢奮鬥之風尙、而進於活潑健强之路、是以全國運動會中、可覘各省市體育之進步如何、國際運動會中、可知各國體育之進步如何、此遠東運動會之所以値得吾人注意也、</p>
<p>我國各種事業尙未全入軌道、體育事業、亦蒙其影響、遠東運動會、迄今已爲第十屆、而我國在遠運會中之成績、乃竟有每况益下、不足與人競爭之勢、雖云勝負成敗、原不關體育之精神、而技術上之遠遜於人、則要亦不可諱之事實、技術不進步、體育之進步亦從而遲滯、故評運動會者、勝負之外、技術亦須兼及也、</p>
<p>今日十屆遠運會在菲島馬尼拉、經十日之競爭而閉幕矣、我國之勝負如何、技術之進退如何、不可不回顧而作一檢討、俾知彼邦體育事業之演進、亦所以作我自己之借鏡、使不再徘徊而不前、庶幾國人之體魄、亦日趨於健强、是則執筆評述諸君、所同期望者也、</p>
<p>抑吾尤有感者、此屆遠運會未開以前、日本代表妄冀邀僞滿參加、以致烏煙瘴氣、不可響邇、猶幸菲識大體、始能成會、不期閉會之前、菲竟蔑視公理、與日狼狽、私改會章、希圖下屆大會、僞滿可以參加、誠不知其是何居心、我國代表、據理力爭、全體退席、態度殊屬正當、但於此吾人更深感於國勢衰弱、隨地受侮、飽受敎訓、而後全國上下、當如何朝夕惕勵、以圖自强耶、此則國民體格之鍛練、宜更不容忽視者矣、</p>
<p>今上海華美煙公司本此意旨、有遠運會總評專號之發行、於提倡國貨之外、復注意及國民體育之成績、其精神良堪欽佩、竊願我敎育界體育界同人、共相勉勵、則華美煙公司之舉、爲不虚歟、用弁數言於首、</p>

<p>— 滕樹穀</p>
<p>此次遠東運動會田賽徑賽兩錦標均爲日本所獲、計徑賽創新紀錄五種、田賽創新紀錄兩種、菲律賓亦屬不弱、最爲悽慘者、卽徑賽我國仍吃鴨蛋、甚至劉長春等預賽亦不上名、田賽則差堪吿慰、且比上屆多六分、於是乎吳必顯之一跳高第四、陳寳球之鐵球與符保盧之撑竿跳兩第二、遂引爲街談巷議之事、</p>
<p>雖然、此絶不能引爲樂觀而以爲滿足、須知我之進步仍慢如牛車、與他國相較、不可以道里計也、吾人應知我之癥結何在、及他國猛進之由、總而言之、由於各方面（含蓄的說）之不景氣、（政治敎育經濟社會均有相當嚴重關係）、如貝加利在亞林匹克獲一千五百米第一、法西斯蒂國之有飛毛腿、皆墨索里尼獎掖之功、封建的說、岳飛槍挑小梁王而中武狀元、有由來矣、（這話仍極含蓄）</p>
<p>（一）敎育不普及、學校缺乏强迫運動、多敷衍門面功夫、大半運動員在小學時代未受基本訓練、中學時代出風頭、大學時代高興玩玩、畢爛後（打烊大吉、）</p>
<p>（一）運動員生活不安定、多走體育敎員一條路、至成績有相當進境、卽以炫人、而爲人師、坐失業餘資格、</p>
<p>（一）全國各大中小學及各城鎭、能有令人技癢、自動的去玩的運動場幾處、（觀「運動大王」影片巴斯祁登之故事可知運動場之重要）、</p>
<p>（一）缷乏脚踏實地經驗宏富諄諄善誘的田徑敎師、大言不慚、尸位素餐、誤人子弟者比比皆是、</p>
<p>（一）缺乏比賽機會、有之、一年一次之應景運動會而已、又不過是替學校做做廣吿、</p>
<p>（一）旣鮮派人赴世界田徑舞台觀摩、又不邀各國田徑先進來華表演、閉門造車、何能上軌。</p>
<p>（一）大半田徑運動員對於飲食起居毫無節制、</p>
<p>（一）不知專攻、田徑員幾屬萬能、籃球足球什麽都要玩玩、爲了替學校爭光、自一百至八百、那種都要幹幹、平時缺乏練習多半臨陣磨槍、成績如何好得了、　　（一）社會風氣太壞、不良習慣太多、又不注意田徑、對運動員之失敗者則妄駡、對得勝者則瞎捧、而批評者卽不從事運動之一人、</p>
<p>牢騷尙未發完、時候已經不早、就此拉倒吧、</p>

<p>— 沈鎭潮</p>
<p>遠東會之足球錦標、爲我國这傳統所有物、歷屆皆爲我國之禁　、他國染指有心、能力不足、不料上屆在東京一役、日本崛起、以三比三與我國戰成平手、不敢與我作最後决賽、錦標遂使中日平分、實爲莫大遺憾、本屆遠運、我國足球隊抱極大之决心、務必一雪此恨、果然消息傳來、三戰三勝、一戰菲、再克荷印、卒敗日本、保持我常勝軍之威名、本屆大會、所　師者、卽此一項錦標、故其可貴、更不待言也、</p>
<p>事前形勢　事前我人雖抱奪標决心、然惴惴於心者、鑒於上屆之惡劣結果、恐再蹈覆轍、菲律賓知其實力不足畏、而爪哇則足球爲其特長、名將如雲、實力可畏、荷印之外、日本是也、選手團旣安抵菲島、電訊傳來、據我國敎練黃家駿之實地觀察、日人技術平庸無足畏、於是必勝之心更决、</p>
<p>江柏功臣　初次出馬、一聲捷報、我以二比零克菲、上半時屢攻不入、下半時譚江柏頭頂開花、紀錄開後、李惠堂隨之再中、二次出師、卽逢赫赫有名之荷印爪哇隊、彼方於上一日、以七比一克服日本、勁敵當前、非可造次、我僑胞亦有出場於彼隊中者、豈知捷報再傳、我又以二對零得勝、曹桂成先中、譚江柏次之、强敵旣摧、錦標已穏、果然最後一場四比三再勝日本、李天生罰出而有此形勢也、中球者譚江柏連發連中二對零、李惠堂繼之成四比三、統觀三局、江柏中球最多、的是我國功臣、而電報記載、其表演亦最令人滿意也、</p>
<p>楚材　用　錦標雖已歸我、而最令人可惜引爲感獨者、荷印隊中、有僑胞五人是也、不能爲祖國効勞、良堪痛心之事、彼等之足球技術、皆出類拔萃之輩、且亦曾聲明倘祖國有所需用、無不樂於効力、故切望我國當局、下次在揀選代表之時、能注意及僑胞中之人才、以實力言、我國之外、以荷印爲最、雖其後敗於菲律賓、比數二比三、然上半時荷印固以二對一佔先也、他種情形、或使局面突然改變、</p>
<p>舉動粗暴　菲以三比四敗於日本、而以三比二戰勝荷印、亞軍遂成三角、菲隊處於主隊地位、天時地利、各得其宜、惜乎舉動粗暴、野蠻可怕、致使第一場中菲比賽、我隊傷至六七人之多、觀於歷屆遠運足球情形、菲人形動、或亦遺傳上之習性、使有以然也、是歟否歟、</p>
<p>長力勝人　日本以一比七敗於荷印、而能以四比三戰勝菲島、復以三比四與我苦鬥、其唯一可取之點、曰長力勝人也、長力爲比賽致勝最要之一點、成敗得失、無不繫於最後之努力、日人雖爲我敗、此則我當效法也、其勝菲一役、上半時以一比三落後、下半時卒能連中三球、反敗爲勝、而與我之戰、三比一落後之時、竟能打成各三之平手、雖然環境不同、其繼續不絶之奮鬥精神、卽其各項事業、成功之所在、我人當有所取法也、</p>
<p>希望無窮　本屆錦標、旣爲我得、前恥亦雪、然流光如駛、時不我予、世界運動會也、下屆遠運大會也、雖云尙有時日、然亦轉瞬卽至、不能因前途之荆棘尙多、而有怠忽、希望爲國爭光、凱旋歸來之健兒、繼續不息、勤加努力、前途希望正無窮也、</p>

<p>— 章繩治</p>
<p>當全能運動開始時、大會已成尾聲、是項比賽僅日菲角逐而已、我國由王季淮張齡佳劉仁秀代表出席五項十項、失敗固在意料中、惟王張劉之努力、深得各方之贊許、精神可嘉、差强人意耳、</p>
<p>五項運動、日軍逞能一時、菲軍　乎其後、我之王季淮雖始終爲國勞力、奈實力有限、終難如願以償、因此是項運動、宛若日本人之單獨舞台、蹤横全場、淸一色包辦前四名、</p>
<p>十項運動、菲之梅氏、實力精强、事前早已料到可得冠軍、當前半部中、梅氏卽以三六九八、五四分、高居首席、我國劉仁秀落選、張齡佳、亦以三二五○、六五分佔居第六位、此外日之村上、朝隈喜郎、小掠啓二、與菲之彭塞爾則分居二、三、四、五、四席、迨入後半部中、除梅氏仍睥睨一切、向前發展外、餘則零零落落、先後被人淘汰矣、而前半部中藉藉無名之金子房雄、齊辰雄、及Ａ葡谷、突後來居上、佔得極優越之地位、張齡佳因撑竿跳與千五百米之成績惡劣、遂致前功盡棄、名落孫山、</p>
<p>一千六百公尺接力、日菲競爭極烈、前三棒菲顯佔優勢、與日相差足有三公尺、我因實力不濟、落後甚遠、最後一棒、更演出極猛烈之競爭、日增田幾追及阿蘭勃拉、到達終點時、菲以一胸之差、卒獲勝利、成績三分念秒三、日本隊、爲三分念秒五、俱造成大會新紀錄、我與之相較、實有不堪回首之感、惟望諸選手回國後、繼續苦幹、來者猶可追、勉之、戒之、</p>
<p>四百公尺接力、可謂日之復仇戰、自始至終、雙方有似同在一條水平線上、正是難分軒輊、最後日終以些微之差、壓倒菲軍、我國慘敗、自不在話下、其成績爲四十二秒三、而菲所得、則係四十二秒四、其戰勢之緊張、觀以上之成績、可知當時猛鬥之一斑矣、</p>

<p>— 瞿越</p>
<p>游泳運動、世界各國無不極力提倡、成績年必有進我國對此一道、尙在幼稚時代、除沿海諸省、略有人才外、内地幾無人倡導、欲與他國並駕齊驅、實難乎其難矣、推其故、一曰提倡不力、二曰缺乏敎練人才、三曰缺少游泳池之建設、四曰不知在方法上作深切之研究、有此四端、遂形成不普遍之現狀、畸形發展、進步弛緩、是殆不可磨滅之事實也、</p>
<p>遠運會之游泳錦標、我國除在第二屆得勝外、餘則均落人後、且往後僅於第三第四兩屆略得分數、餘竟不能開得分之紀錄、年來雖有進步、然與日菲比較、有如千里之遠、且我國第二屆之得錦標也、非我國成績之優異乃日菲尙未知此項運動之重要性耳、洎乎今日、日本選手、突飛猛進、一日午里、菲律賓尙且相去懸殊、况我國乎、日本於第十屆世界運動會中、亦竟壓倒（水上王國）之美國、而取得世界之寳座、尤何况乎遠東乎、獨霸舞台、誰曰不宜、</p>
<p>雖然、壯他人之氣、滅自己威風、固非所宜、然我國應如何推進、如何發展、若長此以往、非特不足與日菲爭霸、卽欲一雪零分之羞恥、亦直等夢想耳、</p>
<p>菲律賓選手依爾台芳索、接連保持遠東運動會四屆俯泳之第一名、誠爲遠運史上最光榮之運動員、卽如曾稱霸世界舞台之日本鶴田小池輩、亦均爲其敗、實令人不勝欽佩矣、我人當知取法乎上、固不獨游泳如是也、</p>

<p>本屆遠運會、由我國之見地觀之、其最値得讚揚者、厥爲女子游泳表演賽、我代表美人魚楊秀瓊、威震菲島、共獲三項首席、以十五分榮獲個人錦標、卽其他諸女士、亦有良好表演、幾將全部包辦、是誠爲我國在遠運會中最光榮之一頁、我代表共有四人、爲楊秀瓊、劉桂珍、陳煥瓊、梁詠嫻、俱係香港女健兒在客歲全運會中、曾大露頭角者、此四人殆可目爲我國女子游泳之四傑、女子游泳係於大會第五日（卽十六日）下午五時、與男子游泳同時開始舉行、第一日項目、計有五十公尺自由式、二百公尺俯泳、二百公尺接力、日本未參加、僅中菲兩國角逐、我四代表身手初顯、卽一鳴驚人、三項首席皆爲我所奪得、五十公尺自由式、楊秀瓊造成三十六秒九三之優秀紀錄、劉桂珍亦得第三、其成績爲三十八秒正、俱打破全國紀錄、第二及第四各爲菲女、二百公尺俯泳、第一名原屬楊秀瓊、成績爲三分四十一秒二、惜楊女士於轉灣時僅用單手觸池壁、致被取銷資格、改由第二之陳煥瓊遞補第一、成績爲三分五十八秒四、第二爲劉桂珍、第三爲菲女、二百公尺接力、雙方競爭異常劇烈、我方劉桂珍先泳、落後一公尺、陳煥瓊、梁永嫻繼之仍落後、楊秀瓊力追、於最後三公尺超出、造成二分四十一秒七之新紀錄、</p>
<p>次日因天雨、大會各項競賽皆停止、十八日繼續舉行、楊秀瓊又獲兩項第一、百公尺自由式造成一分二十七秒五、將三菲女壓倒、百公尺仰泳、縮短一分三十八秒、梁永嫻亦奪得第三名、綜計五項成績、除二百公尺俯泳外、其他四項俱打破我國最高紀錄、可見各人成績之猛進、實屬難能可貴、游泳場中、因我代表迭獲優勝、我國國旗屢升、國歌迭奏、觀者掌聲不絶、取得無上之光榮、我代表於初蒞菲島時、菲人曾作無聊之批評、謂我代表係爲比賽美麗而來、至此菲人始相顧驚服、譽之爲（中國小姐）云、女子游泳、下屆卽將改作錦標賽、已於十八日游泳委員會開會决定、但尙須提交遠運大會執行委員會討論、大致必成事實、是則我女健兒、須再接再厲、準備下屆之競爭、保持已有之霸權、國家榮譽亦與有焉、</p>

<p>遠東運動會於茲十屆、棒球錦標、從未染指、良以該項運動、規則複雜、不易了解、富有科學思想、及冒險精神、均爲我國民族性弱點之所在、宜其不能發達、香港廣東等地、雖爲我國棒球之發源地、然與其他球類之技術比較、相去猶遠、</p>
<p>第八第九兩次遠運、我國由檀香山華僑返國代表、雖未能擊敗日本、奪得錦標、但能戰勝菲島、佔居亞軍、已屬難能、本屆檀島華僑、因時間迫切、未及出席、不勝遺憾、遂由港粤滬平等地、遴選人員湊合、祇求敷衍揚面若有良好表演、於願已足、</p>
<p>菲律賓棒球、經上兩屆慘敗後、遂益堅其報復雪恥之心、菲體協向認爲職業性質的聯合賽中之各隊球員、本屆突承認其爲業餘選手、乃在聯合賽中各隊挑拔精銳代表、遂使視爲（國技）之日本、亦不得不甘拜下風、其投手技術之精、實爲日隊之致命傷、</p>
<p>菲日初賽、日以零比七全敗、而竟得達二壘之機會亦不多、菲隊佈陣守壘之嚴密、投手技術之巧妙、與夫打擊之精確、於茲可見一班、日菲第二次賽、日雖極力振作、卒成二比二和二局、因天黑終止、於是錦標遂爲菲得、</p>

<p>遠東會迄今十屆、除第八屆我國曾一度得網球錦標、上屆居亞軍、餘均名落孫山、足見染指之難、在本屆選手未出發前、卽聞某球員燕爾新婚、片刻難捨、某又僑居異國、將代表當地出席、倒戈相向、種種不景氣、固令人知希望之絶鮮也、</p>
<p>其後竟勉强成行矣、不谓淘汰賽開始、一對四竟遭挫於日本、「中道崩殂」而所僅有之一分、又爲勝人第三流選手、乃本日（記者二十日中夜爲此文）日菲决賽雖未全部結束、而菲方已勝單雙打各一、極佔優勢、出人意料、查菲代表茄維亞氏去夏曾與名寳林且者偕來邀戰、茄敗于邱飛海、勝林寳華、雙打林邱全勝、不謂未越一載、而成績竟若此猛晉、少年英俊、未可限量、日前中日初戰、山田勝邱飛海、今日菲交鋒、茄維亞勝山田、雖先後循環往復、而茹之有爲、絶對不能否認矣、</p>
<p>回觀我國體育、一切的一切、俱在開倒車吿破產中、在昔尙能與人週旋、一二項發揮所長、茲乃僅得一錦標、每况愈下、往者已矣、後猶可追、欲謀體育之發達、一切運動之進步、雪恥遠東、踏入世界舞臺、亟宜作治本之計、庶足事半而功倍、</p>

<p>女子排球　歷屆遠東運動會之女子排球、向係公開性質、不計錦標、以以往中菲日三國技術而論、日本所向無敵、輒居冠軍、菲律賓素非我敵、而我國又輒爲日敗、此次日本未派隊出席、遂成中菲對抗之勢、以三賽兩勝决勝負、我國竟兩戰兩北、開我國女子排球敗於菲島之新紀錄、</p>
<p>觀乎兩次比賽之情形、勝負之分、相差極微、競爭形勢、異常激烈、足證實力平均、堪稱伯仲、但我隊之選拔、係在滬港粤三地凑合、個人技術、固屬佼佼者但事前缺乏練習、不能呼應、更以臨陣慌張、實爲一大缺點、加以菲隊屬於地主、並鑒於已往之敗績、益堅其勤奮訓練之决心冀圖報仇雪恥、於是乎我隊敗矣、該項運動、自下屆起改爲正式錦標、則我國更不可積久準備、磨勵以須、</p>
<p>女子網球　我國男子網球、尙且如此幼穉、　論女子乎缺乏指導、各地少比賽之舉行人材難於造就、年來雖有進步、但與日菲相去懸殊、此次我國所派代表、雖屬國内之佼佼者、徒足以顯示我國技術之幼穉、人才之缺乏耳、下屆大會起此項運動、亦將改爲正式錦標、振軍備武、更不容忽視矣、</p>
<p>賽槍　遠東運動會之有賽槍、自本屆始、僅我國與菲律賓兩國參加計分手槍與來福槍個人及團體賽四種、我國除楊文卿得手槍個人射擊優勝外、餘均敗北、該項運動、將仿照世界亞林匹克運動會自下屆遠運大會起列爲正式錦標賽我國上海萬國商團中之華員、頗多名手、在滬迭獲優勝、將來大有希望、</p>
<p>拳鬥　我國國術界極力提倡之國術、格於規則、難以稱雄於世界舞台、對於西洋拳鬥之不提倡、誠屬遺憾、自下屆大會起、拳鬥已列入正式錦標項目、照我國目下之情形、一背子無出席資格、祇摔角足以他國比賽耳、日菲拳鬥、異常發達、歷屆公開比賽、均有良好表演、我國當局應積極提倡、實爲刻不容緩之事、</p>

<p>本屆遠運會之排球锦標、菲以三勝一負榮獲冠軍、我國在最後一戰、雖戰勝菲島、卒因成績表上祇有兩勝兩負之紀錄、致將連續保持兩屆冠軍之榮譽、未能蟬聯、大好錦標、祇能拱手讓人、寜非痛惜、查此次吾國隊之組織也、係挑選滬粤兩埠勁旅編集而成、其實力之雄厚、爲吾國歷次參加遠運所未有、惟在出發之前、因關於選抜上發生某種問題、當時廣州五將、有不出席之表示、後雖經許民輝之拉攏、言歸於好、但從茲病根己種、而敗兆卽肇於此焉、</p>
<p>綜觀比賽成績、在第一循環中、菲軍兩戰兩勝、我國勝負參半、日則兩戰兩北、詎至第二循環、形勢又變、菲先以三對零勝日、日繼以三對一挫中、而中又以三對二克菲、循環報應、三國竟成鼎足而立之均勢、但菲之所以能獲本屆錦標者、全賴在第一循環中能樹下偉蹟耳、我則不幸遭日本之毒手、乃爲一大致命傷、否則我之成績、適與菲島相等（三勝一負）錦標誰得、猶須另行决賽也、</p>
<p>此次我國之敗、全在（不合作一、　無聯絡）、觀乎第二次中菲相遇之戰績論、益可知華軍之敗、全因事前未能有充分之準備、致臨陣慌張、散漫無紀、及至最後一戰、回復原有實力、果將驃悍之菲島擊敗、所惜爲時己晚、冠軍一席己早爲菲方捷足先登矣、觀此益信球隊之組織首重聯絡、否則各個縱有精巧絶技、其不遭敗北者幾希、</p>

<p>— 夏開明</p>
<p>遠運會籃球賽、中日菲三隊實力相等、事先已預料必有劇烈競爭、而冠軍誰屬、實難憶測、我以前鋒銳利稱、日長於守衛、臨陣饒勇、菲島則攻守迅速、觀去歲聖托瑪斯大學隊在滬之表演、其迅速程度已令人折服、遠近投擲、亦極具把握、此次代表隊仍以該隊爲基本、而辅以其他精銳、其爲我隊之勁敵、識者莫不謂然、</p>
<p>中日初賽　十二日、我旗開得勝、以迅利之攻擊、使日隊驚惶失措、日敎練淺野氏亦謂、我隊聯絡神妙、使日選手精神上受恐佈、一蹶不振、言辭之間、實有（輸得佩服）之槪、上半時十八比七、结果四二比二六、我卒雪上屆失敗之恥焉、</p>
<p>菲日初賽　十三日日菲之役、日努力應戰、除上半時以十六比二九落後較遠外、下半時以追隨猛烈、曾成二九對三六比數、惜最後不振、仍以三五比五一敗挫、而菲隊之傳遞神速與正確、已於此賽中盡情流露矣、</p>
<p>中菲初賽　十五日因雨未終賽而發生糾紛、我根據籃球委員會議决案力爭、正義卒伸、遂於十八日補賽、我正式隊員唐寳　等於開始時竟不出場、以牟作雲、于敬孝王玉增、王錫良王湛若五人先應付、遂爲菲方所乘、連獲九分、嗣更成十三比五、唐寳　等始加入戰團、聲勢漸振、惟終不能超升、由九比二十一、而以十三比二十三終結上半時、下半時仍無能爲力、終以二七比三七敗北、我初不以正式隊員上場、實屬非計、</p>
<p>中日二賽　於十六日舉行、日方之表演殊佳、我以四十八比四十七、一分之差獲勝、要非最後王玉增之投中、必敗無疑、開始時我隊、以十七比七遙領、上半時以二十三比十九終結、下半時日全隊用命、由二七比三五之敗局、一躍而爲四十比三九之勝局、最後我以一分勝、危險已極、</p>
<p>菲日二賽　日隊之表演、旣一嗚驚人、十九日與菲再遇時、更精神百倍、使善戰这菲島、亦甘拜下風、而以四十比三十八凱旋、全局日始終前導、上半時二十比十八、下午時二十比二十、日隊員之奮　精神、確堪嘉許、　　中菲二賽　檢視過去成績、中菲各敗一次、我因日隊間接造成之優勢、自不甘輕易放過故二十日最後一戰、爲成敗關鍵、上半時二十比二十成均勢、下半時我陣容散漫、遂吿落後、結果四十四比三十三、籃球錦標遂拱手送諸菲島、</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>在這一乘鸞輿的前面，有一道短短的小門，當太后上轎的時候，便由李連英先把它打開；太后就從這空隙裏跨進去，進去之後，再慢慢地旋過身來，把背部靠在後面的軟墊上，臉朝着前面，很舒服地安坐在這一問匣子形的活動屋子裏。我們尋常人坐轎子，轎夫往往很不經意地讓他們的肩膀上下聳動，使坐在轎子裏的人、給他們顛簸得非常難受；可是這些抬鸞輿的人，却再也不敢使出這種性子來了。</p>
<p>在太后的座位的兩邊，各裝着一個扶手的東西，都是用黃色緞子包着絲棉做的，專備太后擱置手臂之用，除掉這兩個扶手之外，貼對着伊的胸前，丨就是那一道像短門似的東西，上面也有一條狹長的木板，一般的也有黃緞包着，十分柔軟平整；太后如其想俯向前去的話，儘可很舒適地伏在這門上，因爲它的兩端各有鐵紐扣着，所以是絶對不會搖動的。</p>
<p>這條可以伏着的木板約有五六寸闊，而且是可以揭起來的。說明白一些，這板的下面，雖然在名義上是這一乘鸞輿的短門，其實却是一具長方形的扁匣子。因爲做得和鸞輿的闊度恰好相等的緣故，便一舉兩得的又把它當做了一扇短門；而它的匣蓋，同時又可給太后當擱几用。這個設計的人，在那時候眞可算是别具巧思了！那末在這一具長方形的扁匣子裏面，可有什麽東西安放着呢？當然是有的！第一件便是太后用的粉撲，第二件是一根短短的玉尺，不過這根尺是圓的，太后時常用以摩擦面部，它的功用似乎能够减少伊臉上的皺紋。（三九）</p>
<h3 id="c276">大學生的煩悶 <a href="#c276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>大學生，自然家裏有的是錢。俗語道得好，有錢能使鬼推磨，那麽，有經濟資格而爲大學生，怎還會有甚麽煩悶呢？</p>
<p>據說，大學生，也是有其煩悶的眞諦。第一是不得皇后或公主的靑睞。自己雖然是堂堂一表大學生，可是爲了皇后或公主起見，不惜紆尊降貴的去巴結，費了三天三夜的精神，草擬了一個無懈可擊的具體計劃，向皇后或公主進攻。可是結果呢，皇后或公主，却給别位同學，手挽着臂，或是摟着抱着的表示出親蜜樣兒來。賠了夫人又折兵，大學生怎得不煩悶？</p>
<p>第二，是考試日期到臨了。同班裏那位著名的書　子，不肯帮忙。某敎授又是鐵面無私的拒絶摘範圍。路路不通，無法可想，天助不如人助，人助不如自助，還是（開夜車），漏夜預備爲上策。可是瞧了第二頁，忘了第一頁，瞧到第三頁，索性是瞧得不知所云了。若因考不出而留級，家裏老子動了怒，節制着經濟的供給，那可不是當要的。這自然是該煩悶的。</p>
<p>修業期滿，東張西羅了一陣了，因了祖宗的積德，考試及格而畢業了。這時，又得煩悶着畢業之後的出路。留學吧，自有病，自得知，怕没有希望。謀事吧，小職位不屑，大職位不够本領。天哪，多麽煩悶？</p>

<p>— 楓子</p>
<p>香市消落後之杭垣，自班禪超薦之時輪金剛法會開展後，西子湖畔又平添一番𤍠烈的風光，有自海上來趕𤍠鬧的，有自南京來參禮的，也有本地的善男信女和好奇的人士，見識見識西藏活佛的，被落花蓋上了寂寞的六橋三竺，又在飛揚的塵土裏追回了春的愉快。</p>
<p>聽說什麽法會可以薦升世界太平，那末佛法就可以救國，貧弱的中國一切軍事戰具遠非鄰强之敵，與其空口高倡武力抵抗，不如每人闭門誦經一章。偶而翻涉舊報，見有標題驚目的新聞一則：（推翻僞國義舉失敗，志士高成章就逮！）不必說，慘刑逼供後，志士就義！聯想到抗日英雄江民聲流落海上的嗷嗷待哺。不待否認，他們的義舉，雖是不惜殺身以救國，不能深責其愚，但是以卵投石，也爲智者所不取。</p>
<p>我想救國目的雖同，但方法不必抄老文章，各盡其能，各取其道，又何苦效飛蛾撲燈？打個譬喻說：從商的，千方百計謀其利，讀書的，熟讀其書，間着的人，不妨努力加餐以强身。等等。</p>

<p>— 謝基爵</p>
<p>玩手球，這是一個唯妙的運動，現在風靡全校了！或許也盛行在其他各處吧？</p>
<p>一隻網球戲所用的球，向壁上擲去，起了彈力，回轉過來，第二個人得把它接住，再擲過去，如是連續的表演下去，誰接不住就是誰輸了，輸的次數多寡作成比較的上下。幾個人在一起玩一下是很够味的，也算得是一種全身運動；用了手，不能不用眼去瞄凖，同時脚要奔跑，腦要想，身子要轉灣曲折，所以没有那部分不利用到。而且這是不很需用蠻力的運動，尤其爲一般無運動興趣的同學所歡迎。</p>
<p>起初，僅是幾個人在宿舍的外牆上玩，漸漸大家感到興趣，玩的人更多了：因此牆上窗户玻璃每天總得擊碎一兩塊，結果窗户上的玻璃成了無限制的减少。没玻璃的窗户自然不便，重行配起來，又是一筆損失。宿舍老　（校外宿舍）大爲憂慮，但是無法禁止，投其所好，避免玻璃損失，他很聰明的在宿舍後面空塲上築成一座高可丈餘的牆，塗上水泥，劃出紅線，這可比普通牆適用多了。至於學校裏面，體育部亦已鳩工造成一座木牌，備給打手球的同學用的。</p>
<p>手球，據說也是球類運動一種。但在我們學校裏，這個手球的玩意兒，乃是到回力球塲失敗歸來的同學用以解悶，漸漸的引起了大衆的興趣，所以常聽到同學們口中傳來：「打回力球去！」這裏所謂（回力球）·便是（手球）了。</p>

<p>— 箴</p>
<p>宗敎與學術相衡，敎重於學，學急於敎。其實這是一亟可爭執的問題。我們現代旣無學術，復無宗敎，對於這項問題，不會發生多少興趣吧。</p>
<p>我們是有迷信而無宗敎，有邪說而無科學。然而近代科學進步了，東方文化又要振興了，洋鬼子又漸要被打退了，丨那證據，便是（科學靈乩）。</p>
<p>（靈乩）是中國的國粹，科學是西洋的洋粹。國粹加以洋粹，所以於全國男婦大小，無不適宜。西洋人看是中國貨，中國人看是西洋貨，旣合老頑固的心理，又洽於急進黨的感情。發明之者當然是天才，而利用之宣傳打日本或打英國者，亦可謂不無卓見。</p>
<p>宋朝的風俗大槪比今日中國要好些吧。紹興四年五月，起居舍人王居正言：「伏見兩浙州縣，有『喫菜事魔』之俗，方臘以前，法禁尙寛，而事魔之俗，猶未甚熾；方臘之後，法禁愈嚴，而事魔之俗，愈不可勝………臣聞事魔者，每鄕每村，有一二桀黠，謂之魔頭，盡錄其鄕村姓名，相與詛盟爲黨，不肉食，………民愚無知，謂吾從魔，食易足，事易濟也，故以魔說爲可信而趨歸之」。………當然，其壞可想。</p>
<p>陸游也有條對狀，論妖道之類：「自古盜賊之興，若止因水旱饖饉，迫於寒餓，嘯聚攻劫，則措置有方，便可撫定，必不能大爲朝廷憂，唯是妖幻邪人，平時誑惑良民，結連素定，待時而發，則其爲害，未易可測。伏緣此色人處處皆有，淮南謂之「二檜子」，兩浙謂之『牟尼敎』，江東謂之『四果』，江西謂之『金剛禪』，福建謂之『明敎』，『揭諦齋』之類，名號不一，明敎尤甚；甚至有秀才吏人軍兵，亦相傳習，其神號曰『明使』，又有肉佛，骨佛，血佛等號，白衣烏帽，所在成社，僞經妖像，刻板流布，以祭祖考爲『引鬼』，永絶血食，以溺爲法水，用以沐浴，其他妖濫，未易槪舉，更相結習，有同膠漆，萬一竊發，可爲寒心………」</p>
<p>只要稍留意觀察現代的社會習慣風俗，則知現狀有甚於此者；無飯吃，無敎養，　　之氓，謂之何哉！</p>
<h3 id="c310">科學靈乩 <a href="#c310" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e310" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">310</a></h3>
<p>— 微</p>
<p>中國人是崇尙迷信的；同時，却又喜歡黑漆皮燈籠的談科學。於是，在「靈乩」二字上加上「科學」二字，乃得不脛而走，暢行一時！</p>
<p>「誠則靈」，一般玩過「靈乩」的人說：「只要誠，便什麽鬼神都請得到，便什麽事情都可請問，而且是很靈騐的。」這話我得相信，决不致於欺騙我，不過，他們却受了「科學靈乩」發明者的欺騙了。</p>
<p>世界上到底有没有「鬼神」一類的東西，像一般人所想像的一般，我目慚學識淺陋，經騐不足，難以知道。但卽使有，我想也决不是一隻碟子所能請得到。今假如有幾萬個人，同時「煩碟仙請某某到來談話」，如果請得到，那被請的某某必須有千萬化身。於是世界上便滿是鬼神。如果請不到，那便是「靈乩」不「靈」了。</p>
<p>「科學靈乩」之所以受人迷信，大部分原因，固由於好奇，但多少也爲投機心所驅使。近來各種投機事業盛行，交易所一天之内，可以立致巨富，航空奬劵一中奬，便是五十萬元；而鬼神是無所不知，無所不曉的，只煩「碟仙」一請，和三個人一舉手一按指之勞，交易所市面，頭獎號碼，都可預知，豈不便宜。但是我們仔細想一想，如果「靈乩」有「靈」那末個個人都可投機得利，中着頭獎，你們相信天下會有這樣的事嗎？</p>
<p>科學是用眞憑實據，解釋事物的；說是便是，說非便非。而且隨時隨地可以覆按，不會有錯。說靈乩是有科學根據的，那末也應該隨時隨地，可以實騐，不會不靈。但如上面所說，靈乩能够處處靈騐嗎？</p>
<p>也許有人說：靈乩怎麽不靈，不靈則碟子何以能動？怎麽能檢出字來，答人之問？這個我們却可用科學的原理來作解釋，用不到牽强附會到鬼神上去。</p>
<p>「科學靈乩」是和我國無聊文人所玩的扶乩，閨閣中所玩的請紫姑，是一樣的把戲。與古代西洋人的所謂「魔擺」（ＭａｇｉｃＰｅｎｄｕｌｕｍ）尤其相像。（其他同類的花樣還很多。）扶乩是大家都知道的，有時很能在沙盤上寫幾個字，做幾名文章答人所問。請紫姑是兩個人扶一隻米篩或者淘米的籮，等牠自己動起來，也可以偕動的次數，來回答旁人之問。魔擺是用一條綫，下面埀着一個戒指或小球。綫的他端夾持在兩指之間，手則靠在桌上，不使動搖。這樣拿了些時，那綫便能自己擺動起來。並且能够廻旋。倘在魔擺旁邊，放一隻杯子，問魔擺『此刻幾點鐘』，牠就自動磁打杯子，和鐘一般的打着幾點鐘。若更在魔擺周圍，排列二十六字母，對魔擺發種種質問，那擺便能次第指向各字母，拚出字句來回答。和靈乩之碟能够指出字盤上的漢字來回答一樣。這個現象，在中國人自然要說鬼神降臨，而在古代的西洋人也常假借着上帝。</p>
<p>其實照現在心理學上的話解釋起來，這個現象，却完全出由於「自動作用」（ＡｕｔｏｍａｔｉｃＡｃｔ）</p>
<p>ｉｏｎ）。原來我們心中不論懷了什麽思想，總不免於不知不覺之中，在身體上表露出來，發爲動作，這名爲自動作用。其動力傳於乩棒，魔擺，或靈乩之碟，於是那棒，擺，或碟，亦便自起動作。且往往和心中的思想相符合。所以乩棒魔擺靈乩之碟，其所以能動，仍然是由於人手之自動。假使不藉人手，人的思想便無從傳達，那棒擺或碟是决不會動的。</p>
<p>但是也許更有人要辯說，扶乩者，持擺者，按碟者，在扶時，持時，按時，心中並没有思想，更且毫不自覺，有時心中想牠動，牠偏不動，動了以後，想牠停止，也偏不停止，可見這决不是思想所激動的。</p>
<p>要知道人類的精神作用，分爲有意識與無意識二種。在思想動作的時候，自己覺得的，那種爲有意識的思想動作。若有了思想有了動作，而自己並不覺得，那就稱爲無意識的思想動作。平常時候，人的精神作用，都是有意識的，所以一思一動，都能自覺。但是除此意識作用以外，還有一種潛伏着的精神作用，平時雖不公然表現，但也能思想，也能知覺，也能指揮身體，和意識作用一樣。這個精神作用，心理學上稱爲下意識仍作用（ＳｕｂｃｏｎｓｃｉｏｕＳｎｅｓｓ），平時不與意識作用相通，完全是無意識的。扶乩者，持擺者，按碟者之不自覺其動而動，乃受下意識作用的指揮，其答人問，也是下意識在那里思想作答，所以不是自己所能意識的。</p>
<p>下意識的知覺有時很銳敏，儘有意識所不能知覺的，他能知覺，意識所未曾明瞭的，他偏知悉。這種例子，在心理學上講得很多。這里不贅。有時扶乩所得的文字，高出扶乩者所意識的智識之上；以及「靈乩」圖上的字典，旁人所不易找到的字，按碟者反而很快的指出。就是這個道理。</p>
<p>不過下意識作用，縱然　敏，但仍必以過去的經騐爲基礎。遇到平生所絶對未曾經騐的事情，便也無從作答。卽答也不會凖確。所以若就扶乩者问他未來的情形，往往莫明其妙。在這時，他便只好信口開河，自欺欺人了。</p>
<p>若有迷信「科學靈乩」的人，就請試問一問任何未來的事情，看能有多大的凖確性！</p>

<p>— 高碧</p>
<p>丨爲故友陳行叔逝世三周紀念作丨</p>
<p>（五）某一年的夏季，我跟一位老師約集了幾個氣味相投的「同志」，組織一個簡單的讀書會丨名爲讀書會，實際還是消夏性質丨利用一家學校暑假期内的空間房舍，開始度着我們「　　共研」的生活。幾個「同志」中，有風流藴藉的沙蘭沙，有掉文吟句的俞太容，有突梯滑稽的葛吁雷，有　轉如意的陳行叔，這塲合可就够𤍠鬧了。每日除了兩小時規定時間遵依我們老師的指導各自在室内看了一些線裝書外，剩餘時光，大都消磨在圍坐開談之中。一甌香茗，幾根捲烟，　　乎其有味，就在這樣情形之下袪退了𤍠魔的緾擾。我們談話的基本旨趣，雖不至於衝突，郤也常常閙着善意的駁詰，於此駁詰中領略一些聰明的涵義。行叔是被視爲聰明的結晶的，他的語調，往往不同凡響，無諭是提議也好，申辯也好，總帶着悠然的韻味，令人低回不盡；他又喜歡於别人發揮之餘給一些新穎的補充，或者在大家詞鋒落偏的時節，來一個路迴峯轉的提示。有了他，我們的談話精神　不至於浪費；有了他，我們這一個談話小集團，永不會陷入枯窘的境界。</p>
<p>那個學校的建築，是緊靠着城牆的，我們從樓上架了跳板可以到城頭上去散步。城外有一條很闊的河，蜿蜒地展開着。河的對面有家茶館憑河支起一間水榭，遠望過去，倒饒有别緻的風味。除了對河疏疏落落幾家店舖以外，四面便全是草樹的領城了。我們到了黃昏後上去眺望一回，胸襟頓然會開豁起來。頭上點綴着的是繁星，耳邊聽到的是蛙鳴的嘓嘓，是河流的汨汨，是微風吹動草樹的颯颯，此餐便萬籟俱寂，身處其間，難免會引起無端的感慨來。富於情感的行叔，認這是一角超塵寰的境界，便常常提議到那邊去。</p>
<p>有一天是月明之夜，我們又在城頭上徙倚着。銀色籠罩之下，一切都染上了詩意，特别是水面微顫的波紋，從月光激映下發出來的晶瑩的閃爍，增進我們不少的美感。忽然間蘭沙有着新發見了。他呌我們暫時把四面散縱開的目光收縮起來，射向對河的水榭上去，我們像受催眠般地依着他的話，原來那邊水榭裏正有幾個人坐在傍水的窗頭喝東西，雖然辨不出是喝那一種液體，意想起來，總該是醉人的醇醪罷。如此月夕，如此水閣，悄悄地對酌一回，那是何等可以動人的幸福之事。這當前展開着的，儼然是一幅畫圖了，於是我們個個不自禁地起了甚深的惆悵。</p>
<p>「太容該已聞到對面的酒香了罷！我看他獃地出了神，與其認爲是受了整幅畫景的攝引，倒不如說對着區區杯中物撥動他相思之苦了。」捉狹的吁雷，斜睨着我在說太容，大有手揮五絃目送飛鴻之意，原來我與太容是都有着喝酒的嗜好的。可是他說這話，不僅存意揶揄，也還是爲要打破眼前的沈寂，行叔終於來補充他的意見了：</p>
<p>「我們且不要忽略自己的立塲，在這裏懷着空羡的我們，未必卽能了解實際享受者的情意的，易地而處，亦何嘗不然。原來現實是失望的，假想綫是美滿的收穫，意思上的愉快，只是一種招誘，瞻之在前，忽焉在後，飄管得無可捉摸，憑你怎樣企求追逐，是始終保持着相當的距離的。」行叔的話，往往含有哲理的成分，倒不全是「酸葡萄」式的一種解嘲語。</p>

<p>— 張一蘋</p>
<p>黃梅時節。灰色的天空，没有一絲雨意，天氣比六月裏更可怕的悶𤍠，福興茶園的阿根剛下了刷板，拿鐵條生他的煤爐。他赤着脚，褲管捋到腿灣裏，露出挺堅實的小腿肚，上身敝着大褂子，灣了腿，眼睛盍成了一條眯着那煤爐中的火燄，這是他每天早上最重大的工作，他的食糧，住所，老婆，孩子都在這火燄上打滾似的。</p>
<p>吊子裏的水喘不過氣般的響了起來，阿根舒了口氣，從耳朶背後揀邮半截烟尾，打着火，扳起兩隻泥脚在凳上坐了下來。門外走過一羣担着蔬菜的鄕下人，是趕菜市去的，阿根抛去了烟尾，估計着是徐大爺來的時候了。門外一陣咳痰聲，正是那個高個子的徐大爺，阿根拍的從凳上跳起來，脚下踏了什麽東西幾乎淌了他一交，一邊嘰咕着，一邊高高朗朗的呌了一聲徐大爺。</p>
<p>那喚徐大爺的人不卽理會，他用手帕拭了拭額上的汗珠，小心的走到他固定的座頭邊，把手中的紙包放在臺角，俯身下去理了理他的褲脚帶，抬起頭來的時候，鼻子和上嘴唇扭在一團。</p>
<p>（阿根，什麽臭味？）大聲的說了。</p>
<p>（唔，徐大爺，）那個剛提起吊子，很快的旋過身來（徐大爺，昨夜陰溝淤塞了，今天還没有疏通，那臭味…）他故意鼻子扭了幾扭，（習慣了倒也没有什麽…）没有過慮到對方的動靜，獨自個兒笑了起來。</p>
<p>接着沉默。</p>
<p>阿根才大膽的提了茶壸走近徐大爺桌邊，滿滿的向茶杯中篩了，靜靜的站在一邊等候徐大爺口中幾年來從没有更變的（阿根，去做三個燒餅來。）</p>
<p>今天没有，徐大爺忘了，肚子一定餓的吧，阿根忍不住說了：</p>
<p>（徐大爺可要吃點心？）</p>
<p>徐大爺没有回答·似乎今天什麽都改變了，緩緩地舉起茶杯，送到嘴唇邊又停住了，半嚮，猛的旋過頭來對着阿根。</p>
<p>（阿根，你知道嗎？）</p>
<p>像一個霹靂，對方避巴掌似的退後三步，張着銅鈴大眼，阿根没有知道什麽。</p>
<p>（朱小全死了）拳頭擊着臺面，大槪是黃梅天，聲音並不淸脆（天没有眼睛！）　　（朱大爺…）飛一般的跳前來，脚下又是一倘，可是阿根普不嘰咕，也忘其所以的在徐大爺側面坐了（朱大爺死了？）</p>
<p>徐大爺凝視着茶杯，闭着嘴，賣起關子來了。阿根想伸過手去推徐大爺幾下（朱大爺倒底那個？！端午節不是有兩塊大洋錢到手嗎，朱大爺死，不是死了我的老婆，孩子　）徐大爺果然開口了：</p>
<p>（阿根，去做三個燒餅來！）</p>
<p>阿根失望的接過錢，迎面二個茶客喊進來（朱小全死了·）阿根像被判决了死刑：兩塊錢，兩塊錢，大年初一喊恭喜發財巴望起，哼！落了空，天没有眼睛！他忘了喚王大爺王二爺進裏面請，自顧出門去了。</p>

<h3 id="c314">東北同胞永遠不會忘記是中國人 <a href="#c314" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e314" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">314</a></h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>不久以前，某外交要人發表其對於東北問題的意見，說過這樣幾句話：「本人對於東北問題意見，以爲東北四省，用武力收回固不可能，用外交亦有困難，所以吾人現在主要工作，是如何使東北人民不要忘記是中國人，因爲民族意識消沉最爲可怕，如東北人不能保留民族意識，則長此以往，就無辦法…………」</p>
<p>我們的見解正和這相反，我們以爲要救東北，最主要的，倒不是使東北人民不要忘記是中國人，而是使中國人民不要忘記東北同胞也是中國人。爲什麽呢？東北同胞給日人鐵蹄蹂躪，已將近三年，受盡失省亡家的慘禍，除極少數的人，迷於權貴利益，甘心作亡國奴，情願爲日人走狗外，一般民衆，自九一八事變後，他們是如何在眷念着祖國，如何在盼望着政府出兵去收回失地，如何在組織義勇軍以與日人相周旋，這還能担憂他們會忘記是中國人嗎？反之我們關内的同胞，天天看到肉感豐富的舞女明星，和個人的權利幸福，或者没有工夫再去想到東北同胞也是中國人罷。</p>
<p>我們看吧，東北同胞近日又秘密地寄來一紙（吿全國父老書）了。書中歷述身遭亡國的慘痛，慇慇勗勵祖國發奮振作，共禦外侮，免蹈東北覆轍，又切盼祖國上下團結，預作凖備，以爲收回失地之舉，語悲而情切，一字一涙，讀之凄然！</p>
<p>他們又歷舉十年前之意大利，俄羅斯，德意志等國爲例，切望祖國父老（急作凖備，默中組織），以爲（亡羊補牢）之計。他們以爲（吾父老苟能放棄個人主義之成見，暂取一致對外之態度，天助自助者，必獲勝利。）然而他們（亦非徒以望之父老，而自甘奴辱），</p>
<p>臨末他們又說（吾人爲生活所迫，而留居東北，或有服務所謂滿洲國者，固不必盡同之爲漢奸爲附逆，大都多　得當以報漢者，此不可不察也，且最低限度，國家亦勿爲　而驅雀，故凡現在寄居關内之東北人士，爲吾人父兄者有之，爲吾人子弟者有之，茫茫若喪家之犬，吾國家與華北父老，宜哀矜而撫恤之，勿以其失省亡家，而加以輕視排擠，使其有受内外夾攻之感，是尤吾人所重托於全國父老之前者。）</p>
<p>嗚呼！聞此凄哀之言，國人將作何感想呢？我實不忍卒讀！</p>
<h3 id="c315">或種浮雕 <a href="#c315" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e315" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">315</a></h3>
<p>— 席珍</p>
<p>夜，死了的都市的街。　　咖啡館裏的待者從收歇了的夜市中脫去了白衣走到街上的時候，帶着給工作累倦了的腿和眼睛，瞧那死去了的都市府動脈。</p>
<p>（維也納美容院）門口的廣吿燈是烏黑的，二條狗在關了的鐵門旁邊對嗅了一下，一條狗突然撲到了另一條的身上去；呌起來了，聲音像打鈴一般的疏落地飄過街。</p>
<p>浮動着的；</p>
<p>站在街角的掛着手燈的巡捕，銷合了的商店的鐵栅，黑的陳列橱，紅的藥房門口的警鈴。</p>
<p>瞧着瞧着，憤怒地，拖着沉重的顚疲的腿，羅亭諾夫又想起了；（難道這世界眞的死了嗎？）</p>
<p>吹着𤍠的風，五戈比的酒精在腦子裏起了作用：拖着沉重的巓疲的腿，又拖着沉重的巓疲的眼睛；（夜的幻想曲哪。）</p>
<p>（想起了；彼得喀勒的西班牙式的住宅，開着意大利薔薇的園子，星期天晚上的宴會，祖父的滿身金星章的軍裝照片，父親的瀟灑的紳士風度，自己的建築在别人頭上的靑春，每天晚上吊在美國水兵臂膊上呌着（親愛的）的年輕的妻，藥棉與（高泰克斯）的空盒子，五戈比的酒精的强烈味，身上穿着的一條唯一的沙皇時代靑年軍的軍裝袴，打過了一打以上的補釘，又脫了三顆鈕扣的。）</p>
<p>（沙皇的光榮啊！）</p>
<p>酒精的化學作用在進行的當兒，幾乎大聲地喊出來了；可是没有，瞧着街角的巡捕的手燈，便把升到口邊的偉大的洩抑制下去了，吐出來的是已經變了形的聲調；</p>
<p>（該死的，該死的狗東西啊。）</p>
<p>拖着腿走到一家（阿潑采卡）（俄语「藥房」）的關得緊的漆黑的門邊，瞧着那睡着了的守門的老頭兒，瞧着他的蓬鬆的白鬍子，一把推醒了他，把發紅的眼睛釘住他底臉，吐着不淸楚的雜音；　　（說，老傢伙，沙皇的光榮那裏去了呢？我們底黃金的笑呢？什麽時候再回來呢？你說，你說！）</p>
<p>抖動着蓬鬆的白鬍子，唾沫濺到了他底臉上；（滾你的吧，你這野狗！誰知道呢？誰知道呢？我不是和你一樣的嗎？）</p>
<p>（該死的老狗！我揍死你；）握着挺起了靑筋的拳頭，揮了一個空，便又拖着腿子走開了。驚訝着；</p>
<p>（禮貌呢？温文呢？那種說（是的，先生；不錯，很對）時的文雅呢？那種對女人的（走好，小姐），（請隨意用一點，夫人）的軟調呢？）</p>
<p>變了，一切都變了。現在說的是；（該死的可殺的狗東西！）</p>
<p>可是不對，（狗東西）不是從前也時常說的嗎？</p>
<p>倚着牆，便把沈重的紅色的眼睛閉上了。</p>
<p>遠遠地聽着鐘表店裏的大掛鐘打了五下，街上走着牛奶車，送早報的自由車，澆水的大汽車。巡捕全掛着手燈回去落差了；換上來的，全是一簇簇的穿了鋼馬甲的（四岡），手槍皮袋的鈕扣都開着；犯人車從捕房裏開了出來，便不停地向四處亂兜，𤍠鬧區，冷落區。</p>
<p>猛地想起了；（明天便是五月啦）</p>
<p>聽人家說：五月，是梅子的季節哪</p>
<h3 id="c316">梅子時節 <a href="#c316" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e316" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">316</a></h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>丨要啊！白糖梅子，十鈿買一只嘞！</p>
<p>圓圓地，靑靑地，躺在那竹籃裏，上面，黏附着一層白糖漿，顏色是灰灰地。</p>
<p>這聲音，非常的光亮，從街頭喊進了這靜靜地弄堂，不知是神經有些過敏呢，還是耳覺有些不靈，當那響亮的喉聲飄過了我的耳根的時候，總覺得其中是含有凄楚的成分的。</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>是的，凄楚對於漂泊者的心上，多少總有點苦澀存在的。何况，這凄楚的音波，是在兩年前的今日，有着使我不能遺忘的凄楚的事跡呢？</p>
<p>眞的，日子過得實在太快，這事跡，一轉眼已將近三年了。</p>
<p>據說，在人生的過程中，有必不可少的條件存在着，而戀愛，也就是條件中的主要者。固爲（女人），是迷人的，姑不論這（迷）的程度是高的或是代的，而男子們之甘心被迷，則至爲明顯。這原因，據說是（女人）爲人生中不可或缺的生命素。</p>
<p>然而，誰又去理會呢？這種生命素造成了多少人的苦悶，頽廢，以至於犧牲！</p>
<p>曼哟，也不過是在這沉浮的深淵裏，走上了最後路程的一員而已。</p>
<p>人，畢竟是有情感的動物，在冰火的時候，能憤懣，能痛恨，而在另一個轉合裏，也能奔放，能豪邁的。</p>
<p>假使以曼來相的話，那，他和秀自從認識以後，第二項根本在他們中没有存在過，能存在的，只有相互間的奔放。</p>
<p>記得那是當他們認識不久，一個暮春的天氣，在江南，正是草長的時候：翠綠的天，翠綠的草，翠綠的郊野，翠綠的樹梢，總之，這正是靑年的男女們沉醉的季候。</p>
<p>好像是一個星期日吧？我們相偕着步上一靜穆的愚園路。路面，怪平坦的，房屋，多麽的堂皇啊！走着，走着，脚底下，雖没有皮鞋，但音律却是很和恊的。温風，打在人的臉上，在吻蕩着一絲輕快的笑容。</p>
<p>走進了兆豐公園，不禁的，我有點悵惘了。看，在那碧茵的草地裏，在那雨傘式的柏樹底下，在那山石淸流的旁邊，在那幽悠的走道上，不是嗎？一對對地，在極緩慢的走着，說着，那聲調，多麽的温柔啊！雖則在人種上有着顯易的不同，但在情致上却分不出什麽兩樣的。偶爾的，向曼瞥了一下，誰說不是呢？他與他們有着同一的幸福呵！</p>
<p>也許，漂泊者的心情總是孤苦的，在當時，就使我直覺到有一種凄楚的成分，這成分，說不出所以然，但絶没有妒忌存在裏面的。不知怎麽，我總要遐想，我總想着是在眼前的情致决不會長久的保持的，至多，只不過像一陣烟雲一樣，一轉眼，就會跑了過去。</p>
<p>在那一年的秋季裏，他們偕同着遊玩到杭州，以後怎樣，始終的没有接到他倆的來信。</p>
<p>丨丨大槪他們已經同居了吧？也許已經訣離了呢！誰又敢肯定，可是，信也應該來一封？在無事的時候，常常地我會這樣地想。</p>
<p>朋友，在一起的時候，會逐漸的親𤍠，而在離開以後，便會慢慢地淡薄下來的。</p>
<p>於此，曼和秀的影子，在我的記憶當中，被忘記了。</p>
<p>嚴寒的冬天，不覺的滑過去，在燕子飛到江南的當兒，帶來了這樣的一個信息：</p>
<p>………曼和秀歸後，雖經極力掙扎，欲圖完成宿願，終以家長威迫日急，復無經濟自立之能力，迺於日前，共同服毒情死，留有遺書自白，親友莫不揮涙………</p>
<p>看了以後，並不覺得怎樣的難過，僅僅地，只覺得孤苦和凄楚，更加厚了一層感傷而已。</p>
<p>這回，游魂是的我，又由外面游了回來。不知是那一陣風的指使，又步上了靜穆的愚園路。呵一切，都照舊喲，但是，曼呢？秀呢？那和恊的脚下的音律呢？却永遠的不能再見了。</p>
<p>很不容易的，走到了一條路的轉角，一個童子携着一隻竹籃在喊丨丨要呵，白糖梅子，十鈿買一只嘞！</p>
<p>尖亮的喉聲從我的耳根飄了過去的時候，一陣凄楚直撲上了我的心！</p>
<h3 id="c317">謝三 <a href="#c317" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e317" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">317</a></h3>
<p>— 不危</p>
<p>一說到謝三，使人的腦中卽刻憶起了一個六十多步的佃農，曲着背，　着肚，一張面孔老是很悲哀的。</p>
<p>每當東方發白的時候，他已經起了床，臉也不洗，走到雇主的家裏作零工，爲了五分錢的代價，他就得流一個整天的汗血，自天明至黃昏。</p>
<p>他自己所耕的田，都是在他作完零工以後，在晚上種出來的，每晚總要作到午夜以後。</p>
<p>連年的乾旱，田被太陽晒得崩烈了。每一個農民都哭喪着臉，老農謝三自然是其中之一個，因爲他也是佃農之一。</p>
<p>炎𤍠的六月過去了，接着就是凉爽的秋天的到來，這正是地主們收租的時候了。謝三的家裏，王二爺（他的東家）也派他的賬房來催租了。</p>
<p>謝三和李先生（王二爺的賬房）說了許了多的好話，把家内的二十多石穀統統給了王二爺，而且答應到過年的時候，把作零工的錢來還王二爺的租，才算得了李先生的允許，没有被警察抓到牢内去。</p>
<p>謝三的一家，現在是連吃都没有了！常常看到他們用靑菜作飯吃，靑菜吃完了繼之以草；草吃完了繼之以樹根；他們雖然是這樣的生活下去，然而，他的一家必竟没有餓死。</p>
<p>嚴寒的冬天又回到人間，謝三現在開始收工賬了。</p>
<p>晚上，謝三看着收來的工賬丨銅板和洋錢發呆，禁不住兩行𤍠涙，奪眶而出：幸苦了一年用血汗换來的幾個錢，又快要轉到王二爺的手中。</p>
<p>自徒那年大乾旱後，接連幾年都是大豐收：穀價雖然很低，但是有這樣好的收成，總可以賣行幾個錢。謝三的一家，是不愁没得吃；一絲微笑，在謝三的臉上第一次出現。</p>
<p>經過了數年牛馬一樣的生活，現在手裏居然也有了一百多元的積蓄，這是他和他的兒子作零工和賣穀子所積聚起來的。</p>
<p>土匪蔓延地到處都是了！王二爺爲了避免土匪干涉他的田地，廉價的出售他的地皮了。</p>
<p>希望之大，在謝三的腦中燃燒着；　　晚上，謝三翻來覆去的　想着，最後，决定了去買王二爺的田；這眞是天翻地覆，佃農收買東定的田了！</p>
<p>謝三吃過午飯以後，穿起了他僅有的半新的籃棉布大褂，雙鼻頭的　魚鞋，粗布白襪，興冲冲的走向王二爺的家，去買王二爺的田了。</p>
<p>王二爺現在决定將大路邊的十七畝田賣給謝三，而且是五塊錢一畝。由佃農一變而爲半自耕種的謝三。他是多麽的快樂啊！</p>
<p>軍隊開到鄕下來（剿匪）了！當局爲了便利（勦匪）和運輸槍彈計，長途汽車路在開工了。</p>
<p>不幸謝三的田的所在地，正是汽車必經之途，因之而被剷平了。</p>
<p>這不幸的消息，立刻傳遍了全村！　　（幸虧我那田賣给了謝三，不然可眞倒霉！）得意的獰笑，在王二爺的臉上閃爍着。</p>

<p>— 忘我</p>
<p>不求甚解</p>
<h3 id="c319">白光一道 <a href="#c319" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e319" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">319</a></h3>
<p>— 馬嬰</p>
<p>一個杭州朋友報吿我：（時輪金剛法會攝影時，鎂光忽炸，白光一道，奔如飛虹，活佛竟嚇而下座。）旣爲佛矣，尙畏白光如虎，不但色變，且竟下壇，豈非奇之又奇。所以我聽見這消息之後，迷惑終日，想得頭腦發漲，　恍然大悟。</p>
<p>夫時輪金剛大會者，一以祈禱和平，一以薦亡延生也。世界倘果因祈禱而和平了，則戰爭的惡魔將棄甲曳兵而走，英雄無用武之地。一般游魂倘果因超度而升天轉世了，則閻王老子一定要减少一筆收入。所以活佛知道他做這塲法事，雖是可以施恩於無數芸芸衆生，但也要結怨於幾個小人，有寃必報，有仇必復，活佛知道他們必不肯干休的，便時時刻刻都提防着。</p>
<p>果然在攝影這一天，白光飛來。活佛猛然想起舊小說上的劍仙劍客們，殺人的利器就是白光；也許這白光就是仇人請來的刺客放的飛刀飛劍。活佛因其活也，所以還未能隠身遁形，或竟指頭一指，吐出一朶五色蓮花，擋住白光的來路，故只好走而避之。</p>
<p>可是活佛受驚之後，並不改其初衷，仍然廣施法力，繼續禱求，足見活佛不屈不撓之精神。將來世界昇平，人口增加，皆活佛之賜也。小民受惠之餘，亡魂叩恩之下，應各雙掌合十，敬致謝詞云：（倐爾白光，奔如飛虹。活佛失色，走避愴惶。托天之福，滅了白光。地獄小鬼，　升天堂；人間無事，國泰民康。我佛之恩，廣被四方！我佛之德，天高水長！</p>
<h3 id="c320">吃飯與戀愛 <a href="#c320" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e320" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">320</a></h3>
<p>— 瘦子</p>
<p>失業與失戀孰重，這個問題，前時曾經有人討讑過。究竟是吃飯要緊呢？戀愛要緊呢？這是一個很有趣的問題。依我的見解，以爲吃飯與戀愛，不應該分開。就是說，不應該把這一個問題，分作兩個看。就是要把這兩個問题合起來討論。</p>
<p>吃飯與戀愛，看似兩事，其實是一事，就是「生活」，生活包括吃飯，同時，也就包括戀愛。所以，他的結論，應該是：「有飯吃就有愛可戀」。吃飯與戀愛，永　遠連結在一起的。有飯可吃就有愛可戀，反面，無愛可戀，必然也就無飯可吃。這是吃飯與戀愛的生活一元論。古代社會不必說，尤其是現代社會，更證明了這一理論是正確。因爲金錢勢力支配下的社會，一切都變作了商品，人也變作了商品，女人，尤其是商品中之商品。在這商品社會中，只要有錢，誰就可以買到誰。女人尤其變作了市塲上買賣的對象。這樣，戀愛就與吃飯結合而爲一，而不能分開了。誰能買到飯吃，誰就能買到女人丨丨就是說，誰就能得到戀愛。買飯吃的能力越大，買女人的能力，也就越大丨丨就是說，戀愛也就越容易。反之，没有飯吃的，就不能買到女人丨丨就是說，就根本不能戀愛。戀愛與吃飯，事實上合成了一事。　　戀愛與吃飯事實上合成一事，由此所得到的結論，便是失業與失戀，無所謂孰輕孰重。失業是無錢買飯吃，而失戀則是無錢買女人，看似兩事，其實是一個問題。只要有錢，同時兩樣都可以買得到。問題的中心，不在於什麽失業與失戀，而在於有錢與無錢。有了錢，一切問題都得解决，没有錢，便一切都變成問題的所在。這是現社會的中心。現社會的中心在金錢，金錢支配了所有的人類，也决定了一切的社會問題。失業與失戀，在現社會中，不過是這中心問題所派生出來的種種枝節現象。丢開了中心問題不問。單從這許多枝節問題上去求解决，結果是不會得到答案的。　　那末，現社會爲什麽錢是支配一切問題的中心問題呢？這是因爲在現社會中，金錢脫離了大衆。財富本爲一切人類所共有，而現在却有一部分人把這財富關閉起來，使大部人，與財富發生極遠的距離。這便是金錢所以能支配一切人類生活的由來了。金錢支配人類，因之人類就不能支配財富，而事實上做了財富的奴隸。人爲財富奴隸，故一切問題，離開金錢，便不能解决，金錢代替了一切問題的中心地位；而要將一切問題得到滿意的解决，我們就非先將人爲金錢所支配的社會秩序倒轉一個身來使成爲金錢爲人所支配的社會秩序不可。　　這是一個解决問題的中心點。</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>近來市上一種名科學靈乩圖，是中國留德學生白同君所發明，售價大洋一角半，銷路極廣，無論大中小學生及家庭中，皆具一套。我亦購買一套，實地研究，亦覺得靈騐，能請到孫總理等，不知心理作用或有科學問題否？今且有無知婦人用來問字花及舖票等賭博，一問到開什麽，就用多量的錢去打。輸了甚至要死。此是社會中一重要問題，請先生集多人共同研究，作一詳細答覆爲盼。祝你近來康健讀者李桃生上。</p>
<p>答：編者最近往來於大馬路時，常見路旁攤頭懸掛你所說的（科學靈乩圖），我對於（靈乩）這類東西是很熟悉的，所以它雖懸（科學）之名，也不能引起我的好奇心，招顧它一下。接到你的信後，爲要知其内容，就買了一套，一觀究竟。我看過了後，不禁失笑，這東西確比舊式扶乩進步了，騙人的手段也高明了。</p>
<p>其實這種靈乩是一點深微奧妙的道路都没有的，我們祇要用常識就可暴露出（碟仙）面目。三個人用中指按住碟底，隔了數十分鐘，你的手那有不麻木發痠之理，手旣麻木必然顫動而不自覺，所以你就覺得（碟仙）是眞個爲你請了（鬼）（？）來了。况且三指鼎足按碟，用力必不能平均，方用力稍重，碟子勢必移動，而其他二人因見碟動，又必順其勢而動，但順其勢而不照碟運動方向稍　勾推之力，指必離碟，所以其他二人又遂不自覺地推動了碟子。此後三人（推動）之力輕重之比愈益不平均，碟之進行路綫，也自然負愈無規則，團團轉了。這就是（碟仙召請某某到來談話）的來歷。</p>
<p>說到靈，更是可靈到萬分，你若詢問來一者何人，你自己心裏必已有答案，又必在圖上尋找來者姓名的字，這樣，你雖未故意推動，却因你眼有所見之故，又必自然而然的使（碟仙）代你找到。記得我幼時練習脚踏車，見旁有輛小車停留，思要避它，但結果仍碰在小車上，跌了跟斗。在你手痠顫動之時，卽有此可能。而且，中國字音同義異者甚多，更以牽强附會。我想，除此二者和故意代（碟仙）之勞外，决無其他（靈）的理由。如果不（騐），所答非所問，或答而不能懂，則又必歸咎於自己或其他二位之心不誠，因爲惟有誠纔靈·不誠當然不能靈了。換句話說，靈乩依然是靈的。（誠）我恐怕是很難辦到的，（碟仙）稍有懷疑，不誠；心有難念，不誠；於被請者默禱不力，不诚；……諸如此類，决無（誠）時。</p>
<p>所謂（科學靈乩）之玄妙卽在於此，但我說它較舊式扶乩進化者亦有理由。舊式必書出（字），不作（僞）卽不（靈），而此則無須；舊式用二人對立握乩桿，力易平均，若一方不故意用力，甚難運動，而此則之指按底，易於手痠和運動。所以（靈）的成分要比舊式多得了。　　至於你說到無知婦女藉此詢問賭博等事，正無足爲奇。這種靈乩正是因爲社會上賭博投機心理的發達而產生。不論那個迷信家，得意時總不大去算命相面，失意了則每日求籤，起课，這是一定的道理。在這經濟恐慌，失業增加的年頭，除了賭博是很難發財的，故富者賭公債，窮者賭花會，欲想發財惟有一賭。賭完全是靠所謂（命運）（機會），非人們意識所能左右，航空獎劵頭獎號碼，在未開出前祇有天曉得，鬼神可以吿訴你。因此，所謂科學靈乩，正可作賭博家的唯一導師，你有現在科學靈乩現在在市上不是少了麽，其原因就是航空獎劵已經開過彩，頭獎已經搖出，無須乎再問（碟仙）了。</p>
<p>所以，這些求神問卜勾當，的盛行絲毫用不着奇怪，這正是一般人充滿着（找不着可能的出路祇有依賴命動。）的心理表現。如果人們能知道正當的謀出路途徑，這種把戲必然絶跡，反之，科學靈乩圖卽便打倒，類似這種靈乩的東也是會層出不窮的產生的。而因此，我們唯一的打倒求神問卜辦法，就是使一般人認識自己應該努力的方向，並對於這種方向具有堅决信仰。　　編者</p>

<p>— 羅浮</p>
<p>書於（影片·娜娜）觀後</p>
<p>有一個古代哲學者論及愛波羅（Ａｐｏｌｌｏ）的時候，他說：（愛波羅是一個音樂的神，同時也是一個　手，我愛他的歌，但是我怕他的箭！）看完了（影片，娜娜），第一個浮上心來的印象，就是這樣的一個使人苦笑的聯想。</p>
<p>假使你要在（電影，娜娜）裏面看到一些第三共和制時代的法蘭西社會的情形，或者要在影片裏面觀察一些自然主義作家愛彌爾，左拉筆下所描寫的女伶（娜娜）的波蘭重疊的生涯，那末你的希望是多餘的。更進一步，假使你要從這影片裏面看到一些這位具有强烈的正義感的作者能描出的對於當時貴族資產階級之腐敗的暴露乃至對於當時社會不正的批判，那末你的期待是否定的，（影片，娜娜一和（小說，娜娜）並没有血統的，遺傳的關係，原作對於電影，祇是一個Ｓｕｇｇｅｓｔｉｏｎ，美國的電影製作者薩繆，高爾文（ＳａｍｕｅｌＧｏｌｄｗｙｎ）用着美國待有的大胆的旁若無人的態度，毫不客氣地從法國自然主義作家的作品裏面奪取了他所歡喜的（歌）和避開了他所害怕的（箭）！</p>
<p>用和左拉同時代的偉大的批評家弗朗志，梅林格的話來講（左拉是）一個不能打開時代之深奥的秘密的思想家，是一個美學的尺度下的不完全的詩人，但是在他的才能和勸奮，在他的公正與勇敢，他是一個充分地有權利可以和他台洛，藍幸，羅騷，和伏德爾並肩的戰士！）在他的作品裏面，他不足的地描寫了當時的支配階級，鞭責了都市和農材商人階級的貪慾和反動，暴露了股票商人和宗敎業者的欺瞞和犯罪，更進一步，他還探究了現象和原因間的關聯，而指摘了將要到來的革命。這些，在高爾文眼中，無疑地都是可怕的（箭），銳利的（箭）。</p>
<p>但是，一方面，左拉是一個Ｌａｍｂｒｏｓｏ流的俗學的宿命論者，他不能打開時代的深奥的秘密，不能從他的𤍠烈地探究着的科學的方法，獲得一個對於社會組織之轉化的必然展望，他祇是借用了當時科學家們𤍠心地議論着的關於遺傳和環境的原理，用他可驚地眞摯和細密的手法，描寫了當時社會的一切病態的現象，絢爛，華奢，淫糜，和病態的妖麗。這是自然主義詩人的（歌），一種可以使爛熟了的世紀末的市民和電影製作家上歡喜的（歌）。</p>
<p>採取了這些派生的現象的描寫，和剽竊了（娜娜）這個逗人遐想的名字，而在巨萬的製作費和巨萬的宣傳費之下產生出來的，就是洗凈一切（左拉風）的幸辣和穢臭，而再加了一些濃烈的（仲馬風）的哀愁和傷感的（娜娜）的影片！</p>
<p>的確，這是一個戰爭和革命的時代。十九世紀七十年代的淫糜爛熟了的（娜娜），到二十世紀的四十年代也會變成國家主義的勇士，廳着窗外的（到伯林去）的呼聲，而在臨死時發出了（法蘭西需要你！）的口號！這是以杜萊浮士事件聞名的左拉的作品？丨這已經是（苦笑以上）的事了。</p>
<p>除出安娜史丹的卓越的演技之外，可以推賞的祇是薩繆，高爾文的那種美國商人特有的大膽的旁若無人製片方針和衛拉·麥克的（ＷｉｌｌａｒｄＭａｃｋ）的勇敢的Ａｄａｐｔａｔｉｏｎ而已。</p>

<h3 id="c324">貞節坊下的血 <a href="#c324" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e324" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">324</a></h3>
<p>— 深翁</p>
<p>觀（良宵）後有感</p>
<p>在這新舊過度的時代中，死掉丈夫的女子，究竟應不應該替丈夫守節，是已經成爲一個很嚴重的問題了，而這個片子（良宵），它就是在研究這個問題下產生的，在本片的開塲，膠片上面，標着這麽幾句字幕，是：（柏村裏面三樣多，柏樹多，牌坊多，寡婦多……）雖然是很簡單的幾個字，但，它已經把中國數千年來牢不可破的舊習慣，很充分的表現出來，而本片的主旨，出就給它一語道破了。</p>
<p>這個片子的中心意識，無疑的，它是極力抨擊旌我節烈虚僞·片中的主人翁，她本是一個渴望着愛的安慰的靑年女子，不幸丈夫死去，呌她獨守空幃·虚在這種情形之下，牠倒底不是一個活死人，决不能忘却情慾的本能，但是因爲懾於禮敎的威力，又不敢不强自遏制·當她在郊外和情人默默相對時，爲了情慾的衝動，幾及於亂，但那貞節牌坊的幻影，在她的腦中，頓時一個一個的擁現着，她祇有號哭，奔逃了。</p>
<p>除此之外，它還寫着：族長和有夫之婦秘密通姦，口頭上却是一味假仁假義；小土豪詐財凌弱，他爲了不能滿足自己的性慾，倒來干涉嫠婦的自由；老節母壓死在貞節牌坊下，祇落得給人家咒駡她是自作自受·這些這些，它把窮鄕僻野中的怪現象暴露出來，眞可以說是淋漓盡緻致了。</p>
<h3 id="c325">觀（良宵）後 <a href="#c325" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e325" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">325</a></h3>
<p>— 林辰</p>
<p>在中國世紀式的封建社會裏，貞烈是被視爲至高無上的女性美德的。一座座剝落的巍峨的貞節牌坊下，埋了無數靑春寡婦的𤍠血和靈魂。</p>
<p>（良宵）的全部意識，是　可取的。它用一個靑春寡婦的心靈衝動，與舊觀念的難以解决的鬥爭爲襯托，不但諷剌假道學的僞君子，並且大胆地暴露了舊禮敎的荒謬，殘忍。當這靑春寡婦雲琳被衆手所指斥而用雪去打她，演到雲琳的婆婆毫無顧忌地反駁這些族長族人都是依勢欺凌孱弱的寡婦的時候，這個高潮是很成功的，很有力的引起觀衆們的憤懣和同情。所以（良宵）的意識很適合現在過渡時期的女性，尤其是一班女學生。</p>
<p>演出方面，大槪缺乏穿揷，所以全是靜的調子，但回想寡婦的心理描寫時，却津津然覺其價値。</p>
<p>故事方面，似乎有不很眞實之處。照中國舊式風俗習慣看來，很少責罰不貞的男子的，因爲根本没有判斷男子不貞的習慣。（良宵）中竟有驅逐二十四代孫的事，不知竟有此事否？</p>
<p>技巧一方面我很滿意，雲琳借井水照着自己的容顏，聞琴聲而動脚，都有次序地表現出靑春寡婦的情感。雲琳晒衣時牌坊在她心中動着，她在受（最後審判）時被衆人指斥着，雪中足跡（模倣伏虎美人），族長憤怒的面部特寫（模倣生路），幽會時兩個面影，雲琳躱在樹後送行等等，都有空前的優美的成功。以桃樹作背景，更有哀艷之意。</p>
<p>演員談瑛最好，她的動作表情都以遲慢的西洋派爲長。惟缺乏眼部表情。蔣君超不很有進步，他的表情不很適合劇中的多情的靑年盡家。湯天繡久不見面，而作風一變，大槪有些生硬。飾阿培哥的陳斌遇火一些。其餘平平。</p>
<h3 id="c326">評（良宵） <a href="#c326" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e326" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">326</a></h3>
<p>— 古月</p>
<p>講到（良宵）的演出方面，多方都能得到圓滿，這片子始終能給我們一些滿足。</p>
<p>雲琳淘米時，爲本片最精采的一幕，她很幽怨地望着井裏的影子，而當吊桶放下的時候，將那幽怨的影子，一片一片地分散開了。攝影旣佳，表情也深刻，誠能描寫出一個抑壓在舊禮敎下的寡婦，對於自己的靑春發生無限的感槪！所以，雲琳是一個很難扮的角色，一方面顧着自己的名節，一方却不能壓住她靑春之火，處在這兩難的情况下，她能處之泰然，無論如何，是成功的一個。</p>
<p>劉節母是舊禮敎的服者，可是，她能有勇氣揭破這黑幕，這是暗示着人類的覺悟。在覺悟時的表情，是有相當的成績。</p>
<p>朱英是一個小學敎師，他反對禮敎，可是終於失敗了！他𤍠誠的心，仍不能醒悟雲琳，最後便映成這個悲劇。</p>
<p>攝影有兩幕是極好的，尤甚在雲琳磨米和照井的時候。攝柏村的柏樹和牌坊，也有相當的成功。</p>
<p>導演的技術很高，他能使全劇的分配，得着一些很適當的人材。可是，頭兩幕博叙到劉節母的時候，未免太大兜圈子了。</p>
<p>全劇的演出都能得到圓滿，這是最後該說的一句話。同時比（風）是好得多，因爲（風）祇是描寫一個被都市生活的女性，而（良宵）却是描寫整個不幸的女性。</p>

<p>殷納絲和哈雷登了塲，殷納還是在跳舞的時候，和哈雷纠緾不淸。哈雷則表示厭惡，時時加以怒叱，並且屢次三番，故意用力很命地將她摔在地上。並且駡着牠道：（别這樣有氣無力的。你所做的事，自己小心些）。殷納絲被他一推，摔了一交。她抬起頭來對着哈雷喊道：（哈雷！）哈雷道：（你還要那種樣子嗎？）殷納絲道：（你，你不能離開我。我不讓你走。）哈雷道：（你再不停嘴！）他說着故意放出一個很難的步伐，將殷納絲很命地再摔出去。殷納絲又重重地摔了一交。全塲看客雖然知道這都是表演中的部份，但是大家看了那種逼眞的神情，都不禁嚇得氣都透不過來。後來殷納絲說道：（你要帶着雷那德夫人一同走嗎？）哈雷叱道：（我帶她走，關你什麽事？）殷納絲道：（我不准你帶她走！）哈雷發火道：（好！你敢阻擋我的事！）他說着又很命地將她一推，她就倒在地下了。全塲這時都譁然站了起來。亞爾連忙出來打譁着說道：（衆位安心坐下。這是夜夜如此的。）殷納絲慢慢地抬起頭來，縷的鮮血，已經從她的口裏直流出來。她偷偷兒從她的襪帶裏抽出那把剌刀來，隨着音樂的節奏，霍然地站了起來，向着哈雷迎上去。等到走了身，她說：（你不能帶她去！）她將那刀在哈雷的胸膊扎下去。同時音樂鏘然一聲，　然而止。亞爾明白了怎麽回事。哈雷還抱着殷納絲在懷裏。可是他自己也站不住了。四面掌聲雷動。亞爾直奔上去。假裝着慶賀他們，他將兩臂，一邊一個，將哈雷和殷納支撑上起來。哈雷癱軟了，勉强向全塲鞠躬。全塲又大家歡呼起來。亞爾趁着鬧轟轟的當口，扶着他們進去了。</p>
<p>哈雷和殷納絲進了化妝室，殷納絲立卽就暈過去了。等到亞爾再看哈雷的時候，他已經死了。亞爾情急智生，立卽奔出去尋李却。他呌李却帮他的忙，要拿哈雷屍體搬出去，不等殷納絲醒過來。不過舞塲四週都是警察，怎麽混得出去？於是他們預先拿一瓶酒，送給了一個小門外的警察。那個警察有了酒就什麽都不管了。亞爾和李却兩個人，一邊一個，將哈雷的屍體架了起來，祇當他喝醉了，架了出去。他們將哈雷的身體，一架架到那個弗林一尉的車子裏，向他車子的後廂一塞。一回兒弗林上尉來了，他亦不知道車廂裏面有死人，他就跨上了車，開着就走了。臨走他還對着亞爾道：（再會，再會。明天不要忘記了買報看。）亞爾和他擺着手道：（再會吧，上尉。報紙？不忘記，不忘記。你所知道的，還不到一半哩。）他說着就忽忽地進了舞塲。他亦來不及去看殷納絲，就跑到自己化妝室裏，妝扮黑人去表演黑人入天堂的歌舞去了。（未完）</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The National Finance Conference opened on the morning of the 21st.

Recently, we have suffered externally from the tide of the global economic panic and internally from extremely serious national disasters. We are acutely aware that without enriching wealth, it is impossible to alleviate poverty, and without enriching the people, it is impossible to support the fallen. Xiangxi, with his limited abilities, shoulders the heavy responsibility of managing finances. He is deeply concerned that plans may be incomplete and measures may be insufficient. Therefore, he convened this conference to gather collective wisdom, hoping to achieve concerted efforts and to achieve the effect of relieving difficulties and rescuing dangers. At the beginning of the conference, we offer our utmost sincerity to inform our Premier. May our Premier, mindful of the difficulties and dangers, bless our people. May his spirit in heaven truly witness this. We report." (Central News Agency dispatch from the 21st)</p>

Xiangxi sincerely expresses his honor and welcomes you. In July of the 17th year, this ministry convened the First National Finance Conference. At that time, national unification had not been long achieved, military affairs had just ended, and political tutelage was about to begin. The entire nation was eager for governance. At that time, the work focused on the reorganization of finances, hoping to gradually implement the resolutions, progressing from reorganization to construction. Unexpectedly, in the six years since then, natural disasters and man-made calamities have followed one after another, famines have been frequent, and communist bandits have proliferated. In the past three years, the national crisis and the global economic panic have become even more severe, placing the country and society in a precarious situation. Fortunately, the reorganization work, relying on the efforts of colleagues, although without significant achievements, has had a course to follow. However, the social economy is declining day by day, and farmers suffer from low grain prices and heavy taxes. The income from hard work is insufficient to make a living. Industry and commerce are declining due to the angry tide of the economic downturn, and imports increase year by year. In the past, the problem was financial disorder, but now it is compounded by depletion. Disorder still needs reorganization, and depletion needs relief. Both need to be addressed concurrently.</p>
<p>Finance is the lifeline of the nation, just like blood to the human body. It must circulate entirely to have a healthy physique. If each section acts independently, it will inevitably lead to imbalance and even paralysis. Today, when we talk about relief, there is no way to preserve the dying vitality without making every effort to cultivate the people's strength. To revive the countryside and revitalize the market, we must first enable the people to live and work in peace. The military authorities are now devoting all their efforts to suppressing the communist bandits. In terms of finance, it is urgent to eliminate the burdens of the people so that the suffering they directly endure can be gradually relieved. At the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee in January of this year, Xiangxi proposed the reorganization of the land tax and the reduction of surcharges. The General Assembly resolved to pass it, and the Central Political Conference sent it to the Executive Yuan for execution by the Ministry of Finance. However, this matter is significant and requires the strength of the masses to facilitate progress, and it especially depends on the local authorities to discuss implementation plans based on local conditions. There are myriad aspects to financial management, which cannot be accomplished by one person alone. At this time of declining people's livelihoods and national crisis, there are many priorities in planning restoration, and the order of urgency must be carefully considered. Moreover, in today's China, there are many things to discuss in reorganizing finances, and the following issues deserve special attention:</p>
<p>(1) How should we find alternative ways to compensate for reducing land tax surcharges so as to alleviate the people's difficulties without hindering construction?</p>
<p>(2) What kind of good taxes should be established to replace the abolition of exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies and to find new sources of revenue?</p>
<p>(3) How should the tax system be improved to ensure that the people's burden is fair and does not lead to uneven or excessive burdens?</p>
<p>(4) How should the foundation of local budgets be determined to ensure that revenue and expenditure are balanced?</p>
<p>(5) How should national revenue and expenditure be coordinated to balance surpluses and deficits and avoid uneven distribution of hardship and prosperity among different regions?</p>
<p>(6) How should the ratio between administrative expenses and business expenses be properly determined to ensure that funds are not wasted and that no task is neglected?</p>
<p>(7) How should the qualifications, guarantees, and reward and punishment methods of tax officials be determined to increase tax revenue?</p>
<p>(8) How should the currency system be reorganized to facilitate the people and stabilize the market?</p>
<p>(9) How should finance be circulated and idle funds be utilized to support production enterprises?</p>
<p>(10) China's foundation is agriculture. The rural economy is now on the verge of bankruptcy. How should we find ways to provide relief to assist farmers in increasing production and to seek the revival of agriculture and the development of abundant resources?</p>
<p>(11) Industry and commerce are declining day by day. How should we find ways to encourage domestic goods and support production to reduce leakage and seek economic development?</p>
<p>(12) Regarding local security, transportation, education, and other policies, how should we utilize the capabilities of autonomy and self-defense to reduce expenditure and the burden of tax surcharges?</p>
<p>(13) How should the New Life Movement be promoted to advocate thrift and foster integrity?</p>
<p>(14) How should the central and local governments support each other internally and externally to jointly seek development?</p>
<p>The above are just a few of the major issues that need to be resolved urgently. The reorganization of the land tax, the equalization of burdens, the determination of local budgets, the opening of tax sources, and the reform of the currency system are particularly urgent. They require collective wisdom and careful planning. Over the years, rental taxes have increased, and in various cities and provinces, new policies have been implemented for important purposes. The central government is well aware of the unavoidable difficulties. However, considering the people's strength, it is truly unbearable. Resolving to eliminate them is like a hero cutting off his wrist. Although reducing surcharges to relieve the people's difficulties will harm local income, thoroughly reorganizing tax revenue, developing production, and cultivating tax sources can increase revenue and may be sufficient to offset the losses. The central and local governments are originally one body, sharing weal and woe, and there are originally no boundaries to divide. In this time of crisis, it is especially important to unite sincerely to overcome difficulties. Therefore, although the central government's finances have been extremely difficult in recent years, if there is an urgent need for local governments, it will still make every effort to provide assistance even when there seems to be no way to do so. For example, recently, as the communist areas in Jiangxi Province have gradually recovered, the countryside urgently needs revival. Therefore, Chairman Chiang and Chairman Xiong discussed with President Wang and Xiangxi and decided to exempt the entire province from exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies. The insufficient funds will be supplemented by the ministry. However, this is only a temporary measure and not a fundamental solution. To seek a fundamental solution, we must open up sources of production and reduce wasteful spending. The key lies in determining the budget. The central government must have a thorough understanding of the actual revenue and expenditure of local governments in order to make appropriate allocations and have sufficient measures. This is what the central and local governments should encourage each other to do.</p>
<p>There are three reasons why our country's finances have been weak and why accumulated malpractices have been difficult to reform. First, corrupt officials engage in private gain and abuse their power to enrich themselves. Second, construction is not carefully considered in terms of urgency, and spending is not frugal. Third, officials are extravagant by nature and waste public funds excessively. Therefore, what the country takes from the people is not small, but through repeated exploitation, little wealth remains. The country is poor and the people are poor, and this is the root cause. The officials in charge of tax collection have known the source of these malpractices for a long time, but they have tolerated them in silence, mostly out of multiple considerations and bending over backwards to protect them. To fully express the bottom line would be inconvenient for private gain. It must be known that when the government is in a time of crisis, the way to save the situation lies in bringing the national finances into order. If the finances are not in order, there is no way to carry out governance. If governance cannot be carried out, how can the country be revived? Revolution must first revolutionize the heart. Public officials must thoroughly remove accumulated bad habits and completely eliminate old stains before they can talk about promoting benefits and eliminating malpractices, and being clean and serving the public. Otherwise, even if the discussions result in concrete plans, they will not be implemented, or they will not be implemented effectively, and they will remain empty words. This is what is hoped for from all public officials in the country to have a deep awareness of.</p>
<p>The national crisis is now serious, and the global economic downturn has spread to our country. Countries are too busy saving themselves from the economic panic to help others. Our country's production is backward and its economy is declining. If we do not quickly seek a way to save the situation, we will be heading towards danger. The most important thing at present is for the government and the people to work together. The people must strictly supervise the collecting officials to prevent them from engaging in corruption and enriching themselves. They must also deeply understand their tax obligations and work hard to produce to enrich tax sources. If the top and bottom are of one mind and work together to save the situation, the national economy and the people's livelihood can be enriched, and the crises of the future can be averted. This is what is hoped for from the people to have a deep understanding of.</p>
<p>In short, the convocation of this National Finance Conference is not only to discuss the reorganization of finances but also to address the prosperity and decline of the people's livelihood and the well-being of the nation, which are closely related. I deeply hope that you will remember the difficulties that the Premier faced in creating the Republic of China and the hard-earned legacy left by our Yellow Emperor ancestors. The current dangerous situation and the responsibility that lies on our shoulders are extremely heavy and great. We must have the spirit of self-denial and sacrifice and a deep and clear understanding. Officials and people, internal and external, must work together as one to reverse this precarious situation. Finance is the lifeline of the nation, and the blood must circulate, as has been said before. A person who suffers from anemia or toxic blood will be weak and sick. Today, our country is suffering from this disease. You have come here specifically to work for the country's blood purification and blood transfusion. However, without thoroughly removing the selfish heart for oneself, the country will still be unsavable. This conference, although for the purpose of saving finances, is actually for the purpose of saving the country and saving the people. In other words, it can be said to be a salvation conference. All experts, representatives from various provinces and cities, and financial personnel from various provinces and cities must deeply understand that in this time of extraordinary national crisis, they should painfully remember the meaning of loving the country and forgetting the family, and being selfless and forgetting the self. They should jointly discuss how to overcome difficulties, not engage in high-sounding and impractical words, and not engage in empty and unrealistic theories. The words should all have substance and be feasible to implement, so that they can achieve the effect of relieving difficulties and supporting the crisis through a step-by-step approach. This is what Xiangxi hopes for. We look forward to your wise advice and await your excellent remarks.</p>

<h3 id="e5">President Wang Delivers Address <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) President Wang said in his address at the Finance Conference: "The convening of today's Finance Conference is of great significance, and it is even more significant to convene it during this time of national crisis. Those responsible for finances now feel a contradictory pain. On the one hand, they must raise funds from the people, and on the other hand, the people no longer have the ability to pay. It is difficult to find a solution to this contradiction. China has been an agricultural country since ancient times. All that the government needs to do is to achieve the eight characters of 'simple government, clear laws, light taxes, and low levies.' The amount taken from the people should be small, and the amount of work done for the people does not need to be much. Since the opening of China to foreign countries, the situation has changed greatly. The agriculture, industry, and commerce of various countries have been highly developed, and competition is fierce. China is in this international environment, and what is taken from the people and used for the people is not comparable to before. Just look at the military. Building a gunboat requires tens of millions or hundreds of millions of military expenses. Everything else is the same. For example, in terms of transportation, foreign countries can transport troops to China with extremely fast warships. According to our past experience, it takes 20 to 30 days to transport one or two divisions of troops from Jiangxi to Shanghai. How can we avoid the danger of the relief troops not arriving in time? However, the construction of railways and highways requires huge amounts of money. If we still use the eight characters of 'simple government, clear laws, light taxes, and low levies' as the standard, our country will not be able to exist. I know that those serving in the central and local governments feel that China lacks the conditions needed for a modern country and must try their best to catch up. However, the difficulty of finance and the exhaustion of the economy make it impossible to start. According to the report of the Customs, imports exceeded exports by 600 million last year. The people eat foreign rice and flour, and the people wear foreign cotton and yarn. Almost everything we need in life depends on foreign countries. They have strong capital and can sell at low profits and high volume. We have weak capital. How can we compete? All agriculture, industry, and commerce cannot compete with others. The countryside is already very desolate, and society is already very poor. Now is the time when the people need relief. If we continue to levy taxes and extract the fat of the people, it is really unbearable. Therefore, the central and local governments alike must find money on the one hand and not ask the people for more money on the other hand. This contradictory phenomenon has become the pain of our finances. As for the solution, Vice President Kong has already said a lot, and I cannot say more. However, at this time when the national crisis is most severe and the national economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, the people passively hope for the government's relief and hope for the reorganization of taxes. Actively, the government should do a lot of work in production and construction. This financial problem and tax problem must be solved. If it cannot be solved, there will only be destruction. Therefore, this Finance Conference is not only a financial problem, but also a problem about the life of the nation. I hope that the central and local representatives and experts will, during these few days of meetings, base their knowledge and experience on finding appropriate solutions. This solution is the way out for China's finances and the way out for the Chinese nation." (Special dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<h3 id="e6">Representative of the National Government Delivers Speech <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Representative of the National Government, Deng Jiayan, said in his address: "What I want to say now is what Mencius said, 'The loss of the world by Jie and Zhou was the loss of their people, the loss of their hearts. There is a way to gain the world: gain the people, and you will gain the world. There is a way to gain the people: gain their hearts, and you will gain the people. There is a way to gain their hearts: gather what they desire, and do not impose what they hate.' This is truly the best teaching for us. The Premier's Principle of People's Livelihood also focuses on relieving the people's economic oppression. Today, the surcharges on land taxes exceed the regular taxes by more than ten times. In addition, there are exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies. The burden on the people can be imagined. I hope that in this conference, we can seek practical solutions and implement all resolutions conscientiously. 'Governance does not lie in much talk, but in how to implement it.' This is especially what should be contributed to everyone present." (Special dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<h3 id="e7">Zhang Shouyong's Speech <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) At the opening of the Finance Conference, expert member Zhang Shouyong gave a speech, roughly saying that the national crisis is now severe and the economy is on the verge of bankruptcy. President Wang mentioned that the Customs' imports exceeded exports by 600 million yuan each year. How to overcome this crisis must be carefully studied. China is an agricultural country, but in recent years, the countryside is on the verge of total collapse. This spring, Shouyong returned to his hometown for business and talked with the general farmers. According to the farmers, they are still in debt after paying the rent. China has few large farmers and many small farmers. Because labor costs are high and rice prices are low, and taxes are heavy, this is a major cause of rural bankruptcy. At this Finance Conference, representatives from various provinces and cities and experts gathered together to discuss and will surely be able to come up with remedial measures for China's finances in the future. At the same time, we must also fight for a breath in the international arena. Shouyong, as a citizen, hopes that the central and local gentlemen will make a firm decision. At a minimum, from today onwards, never increase taxes. As for the previous excessive surcharges, there should be a gradual reduction method, and it is hoped that exorbitant and petty taxes will be abolished immediately, and so on.

<h3 id="e10">The Disarmament Conference on the Verge of Collapse <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>Although there is still talk that the Disarmament Conference Committee in Geneva will meet on the 29th of this month, its hope of success has been exhausted. One reason is that Germany's recently announced military budget has exceeded the limits allowed by the Treaty of Versailles.</p>
<p>The country also feels that the Disarmament Conference is about to fail, so it is eager to strengthen its national defense. From these three aspects, it can be seen that the fate of the Disarmament Conference is hanging by a thread, and the pronouncement of its death sentence is only a matter of time.</p>
<p>For now, leaving aside this fragmented phenomenon and focusing on the root cause, the reason why disarmament cannot be achieved is even more obvious. International peace must be based on friendship, and the attainment of friendship must be based on fairness. Otherwise, it will be difficult to avoid the repeated breeding of old hatreds and new grudges, and the beautiful name of peace will become a mere bubble. Perhaps some fail to observe the inversion of cause and effect, thinking that if disarmament is achieved, peace can be guaranteed. They do not know that without the elements and conditions of peace, advocating disarmament is either foolish or deceitful. Therefore, seeking peace through disarmament is a direct example of abandoning the root and pursuing the branch. The reason why disarmament is unsuccessful is not that the countries lack sincerity.</p>
<p>When the European War was in progress, the Allied countries called it the "war to end war," meaning that there would be no more suffering from war after this, once and for all. After the war stopped, they should not have imposed the shackles of the Treaty of Versailles on Germany. After the treaty was signed, they should not have ignored the clear wording of universal disarmament in the treaty, making Germany suffer alone. Unexpectedly, the Allied countries had not yet completed their victory song when their old habits reemerged. Secret treaties to divide the future spoils of war emerged one after another, such as dividing the land of the defeated countries, extorting reparations from the defeated countries, and restricting the armaments of the defeated countries. They used every means to the extreme. How could they gain the goodwill of the defeated countries? Therefore, the day the Treaty of Versailles was signed was also the time when the next great war was sown.</p>
<p>Furthermore, disarmament and the League of Nations were originally inseparable. The success of disarmament would naturally increase the prestige of the League of Nations. However, there must first be a strong and powerful League of Nations before it can use its prestige to promote the success of disarmament. Since the September 18th Incident, the weakness and incompetence of the League of Nations have been fully exposed. The reason why Japan dared to brazenly withdraw from the League of Nations and the reason why Germany dared to follow in Japan's footsteps were all the results of seeing through this weakness. Even saying that the omen of the failure of disarmament today can be seen again at the beginning of Japan's invasion of our Northeast is not an overstatement.</p>
<p>As for the direct cause, it is the rise of Hitler in Germany. In December 1932, the five countries of Britain, the United States, France, Germany, and Italy signed the so-called protocol recognizing the principle of equal status for German armaments. The new British draft on March 16 of the following year allowed Germany to establish an army of 200,000 men within eight years. France's attitude also seemed to have room for maneuver. However, after Hitler came to power and vigorously implemented his active foreign policy, he deeply incurred the jealousy of France. Last winter, Germany withdrew from the League of Nations, and the Disarmament Conference was already in a desperate situation. The reason why it still had a glimmer of hope was that Britain mediated between France and Germany to seek a compromise. Unexpectedly, Germany announced a new budget, openly increasing military spending, causing France to refuse to negotiate further with Germany. The one glimmer of hope for the conference was cut off by Hitler's tough attitude, which is truly regrettable.</p>
<p>The heart denies that Germany has any more rights to equal armaments. France's fear of Germany and its own isolation are also reflected from this. If France were to go to war with Germany today, the assistance it would receive abroad would be far less than in 1914. It can be predicted that Britain will take a neutral attitude as much as possible towards the war between France and Germany, except for maintaining its obligations under the Locarno Treaty. The fact that it wants to conclude an air force agreement with the Paris government shows that its fear of France is not small. As for Italy after the war, its interests have always conflicted with France. Although it cannot be said that it will definitely help Germany attack France in the future, it will inevitably sit on the sidelines and reap the benefits. The only support that France can rely on is the Little Entente. However, Austria-Hungary is manipulated by Italy, and the Little Entente is restrained by Austria-Hungary. How much substance is there in the Little Entente? It is truly questionable. On the other hand, Germany's developed machinery industry, strong national will, and prevalent martial spirit make it not very difficult to prepare for war. Even in terms of population, it far surpasses France. It is said that between 1936 and 1940, the number of French combatants will only be half of what it was at the outbreak of the last great war. This alone is enough to make them feel a great threat.</p>
<p>In short, the Disarmament Conference convened by the League of Nations has reached the stage of death. Afterwards, the situation in Europe will inevitably become more dangerous. No matter which direction British policy tends towards, or whether it maintains neutrality, it can be asserted that its focus is on seeking self-preservation as quickly as possible. The impact of this may be enough to make the British change their understanding of the Far Eastern problem, which is something that we Chinese people should pay close attention to and plan for ourselves.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) This morning, they went to the financial conference to petition for maintaining sailing transportation. Several people first met with Ma Taiqi, Director of the Salt Affairs Department. Ma promised to forward their intentions. In the afternoon, they met with Minister Kong, who promised to find ways to maintain all points of the request and said that he was drafting short-term and long-term solutions. The representatives reported Kong's replies to the entire group of boatmen representatives. Some believed that since the short-term and long-term solutions had not been formally announced, they could not consider it satisfactory. They were unwilling to return to the weir before the government gave a satisfactory reply and scheduled to go to the central government to petition on the 22nd (Special Dispatch on the 21st).</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Xu Haishen and over three hundred representatives of the sailors of eighteen gangs of salt-transporting sailing ships from Twelve Weirs went to the Ministry of Finance during a conference held at the Ministry on the morning of the 21st to petition for changing back to sail and abolishing motorized transport. Ma Dai was first sent by the Ministry of Finance to meet them and promised to convey their intentions. At one o'clock in the afternoon, Minister Kong personally met them. The representatives knelt on the ground and cried bitterly. Kong then instructed the Salt Administration to summon transport merchants to quickly devise relief measures (Central Dispatch on the 21st).</p>
<h3 id="e13">A Glimpse of Proposals <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>(Topic) Please exempt various provinces from miscellaneous taxes to save the cotton industry from crisis. (Reason) Regarding the matter of the proposal, after the implementation of consolidated taxes in the cotton industry, the tax rate it bears is several times higher than the old tax. The original expectation was "one item, one tax," which would be implemented nationwide, no longer subject to exploitation similar to likin. However, as the law has been in effect for a long time, various provinces have new taxes emerging endlessly. For example, Hunan has production and sales taxes and road construction donations; Jiangxi has production and sales taxes; Hubei has brokerage taxes, etc. All of these are within the consolidated tax area. Those not within the consolidated tax area include Sichuan with landing taxes, import donations, and bandit suppression donations; Guangdong has the heavy re-levy of consolidated tax; and other miscellaneous taxes similar to likin are numerous, and the burden is particularly heavy. What is even more serious is that in Shandong Province along the Jiaoji Railway line, only Chinese yarn shops have the burden of business tax, while Japanese merchants do not have this tax, resulting in Chinese yarn sales being completely occupied by Japanese yarn. Although this committee has repeatedly appealed to the central government, it has not been thoroughly resolved. Therefore, this case is specially submitted, requesting the fundamental elimination of all miscellaneous taxes on yarn, cotton, and cloth in various provinces to relieve the cotton industry.</p>
<p>(Topic) Please thoroughly exempt yarn factory branches and offices from business tax on sales of yarn and cloth to maintain the cotton industry and avoid disputes. (Reason) Article 1 of the Business Tax Law states, "Factories that have already paid factory tax to the central government are exempt from business tax." Article 5 of the Cotton Yarn Consolidated Tax Regulations states, "Cotton yarn that has already paid consolidated tax and its directly woven products shall not be subject to other taxes and levies when transported and sold in various provinces." According to the Business Tax Law, factories that have already paid factory tax to the central government are exempt from business tax. Therefore, branches and factories are one entity, representing the head factory, and should naturally also be exempt. According to the Consolidated Tax Regulations, cotton yarn and its woven products shall not be subject to other taxes and levies when transported and sold in various provinces after consolidated tax has already been paid. Therefore, the scope of the consolidated tax is extremely broad and does not only refer to production tax. Since it is called "transport and sale," there are naturally business activities. Since it is said that "other taxes and levies shall not be levied," business tax should naturally not be levied. It was found that on April 28th of this year, the Ministry of Finance communicated to various provinces and cities the nature of the exemption from business tax for branch offices established by factories or companies that have paid consolidated tax for further clarification as follows: "For branch offices established in various places by factories or companies that have paid consolidated tax, if their business is only to deliver goods and collect payments on behalf of the head factory or head company, and they themselves have no capital or net profit income, and do not concurrently operate other businesses, and are indeed the main body of the head factory or head company, they are exempt from business tax." Although the explanation is already clear, the financial departments of various provinces still do not understand the word "delivery," believing that the head factory's goods can only be delivered to merchants by the branch office and cannot be sold to merchants. Therefore, disputes have not been completely avoided. However, the official letter from the Ministry of Finance replying to this committee stated that "For various manufacturers who set up branch offices in various places, if they are only for promotion and contact, the request for exemption from business tax is still feasible." However, when communicating to various provinces and cities, it said "deliver goods and collect payments" instead of "sell goods and collect payments." Therefore, the so-called "eliminating difficulties for collection agencies and resolving disputes for manufacturers" has not been thoroughly implemented. At a time when the cotton industry is extremely depressed, the suffering of manufacturers should be thoroughly resolved, changing "delivery" to "sale" to avoid disputes. (The above proposal is from the National Economic Committee)</p>
<p>(Topic) Determine local budget methods. (Methods) 1. Prepare and submit budgets on time: Detailed regulations are provided in the budget charter and budget law. The legislative purpose is to determine revenue and expenditure and limit additional funding. If provincial and municipal governments can prepare budgets on time in the future, financial difficulties can be gradually resolved. 2. Prepare realistic budgets, with the principle of matching revenue and expenditure. However, the budgets prepared by various provinces and cities either have more expenditure than revenue or more revenue than expenditure, which is inconsistent with the principle of matching. If balance is forced by using fictitious revenue and expenditure to embellish the situation temporarily, it is not allowed according to the correct purpose of the budget. 3. Strive for self-sufficiency. It is generally recognized nationwide that the central government is currently facing financial difficulties and is unable to subsidize local areas. After the abolition of likin in various provinces and cities, the central government allocated funds to subsidize them, which was originally a temporary expedient. If local areas do not have a plan for self-sufficiency, and face incidents where the central government is unable to take care of them and the source of funds suddenly dries up, the danger is worrying. It seems that without the determination of self-sufficiency, it is not enough to consolidate the foundation of local finances. 4. Spend within income. The promotion of government affairs depends entirely on the amount of funds, and the amount of funds depends on the priority of importance and urgency. The financial reorganization methods of various provinces and cities vary, but the basic principle at present is to spend within income. According to the investigation, Chairman Chiang reorganized the local finances of the bandit suppression areas in Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces, comprehensively managed and allocated the budgets of the three provinces for the 21st and 22nd years of the Republic, and greatly reduced them. What the provincial authorities previously considered to be insufficient to cover expenses and impossible to cope with is now roughly appropriate. This is based on the principle of spending within income, and then determining the policy direction to avoid the situation of supply and demand not meeting, sighing to the roof, or causing annoyance to the people and exhausting the tax base. The above four items are the methods to resolve current difficulties. As for the fundamental plan for determining the budget, the following two points should also be noted: 1. Save on administrative expenses to expand business expenses. In March of the 20th year of the Republic, the Executive Yuan, according to the report of the Ministry of Interior, stipulated that the administrative expenses of each province should not exceed three-fifths of the business expenses. Business expenses are related to local construction, culture, and economy. To improve from this, the provincial and municipal governments should be responsible for reducing administrative expenses, leaving room for construction needs. 2. Opening up financial resources must not exceed the national economy's ability to bear. Local government affairs are progressing with the times, so the need for government expenses, and its revenue, will increase accordingly. The argument for opening up sources of revenue is obvious. However, the national ability to bear is ultimately limited. Once it is exceeded, it is tantamount to destroying the national economy and causing social prosperity to decline. This is what the financial authorities of each province and city should pay close attention to. (Proposed by the National Government Accounting Office)</p>
<p>(Topic) Provinces may not re-levy taxes on goods that have already been subject to the central consolidated tax. (Methods) It was found that in the past, when provincial governments or military agencies re-levied taxes on goods subject to consolidated tax, the Ministry would issue orders or instructions to stop them, but there were no strict measures to crack down on them. It is now proposed that, in addition to requesting the National Government to issue a general order to the provincial governments and military commanders to investigate and determine the re-levy situation under their jurisdiction and prohibit it within a time limit, the National Government should also clearly stipulate punitive measures for re-levying consolidated tax and promulgate them for implementation. If county and city governments or local organizations re-levy taxes, the provincial finance department should be responsible for refunding the amount in full and deducting the county and city governments' administrative expenses to compensate in order to maintain the tax system and provide a warning. (Topic) Abolish local surcharges under tobacco and alcohol categories. (Methods) All tobacco and alcohol surcharges in various provinces are close to being arbitrary taxes and levies and are listed for abolition in the previous National Finance Conference resolution. It is not appropriate to delay it for a long time, which would hinder tax administration. As the fiscal year begins, provinces should quickly find other ways to compensate within the scope of local taxes so that provincial bureaus can be ordered to immediately stop collecting the aforementioned tobacco and alcohol surcharges. Areas that have not implemented surcharges should not take the opportunity to do so to alleviate merchants' difficulties and comply with the original plan. (The above proposals are from Wu Qiding, Director of the Tax Administration).</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The dismissal of Vice Minister of Finance Kuroda has now been formally announced. The appointment of his successor was officially announced today as follows: Fujii Shinren, Director of the Budget Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, is appointed Vice Minister of Finance. (Telecommunications Dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Former Vice Minister of Finance Kuroda Hideo has now been taken into custody, and Okubo Teiji, Director of the Bank Bureau, has been summoned by the Prosecutor's Office. The investigation into the Ministry of Finance by the legal community seems to have come to an end. However, in the future, it is feared that it will expand or even affect influential figures in political parties and the top executives of the Bank of Japan. Therefore, all parties are paying close attention. (Telecommunications Dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The judiciary's pursuit of the Kuroda case is becoming increasingly urgent. The Prosecutor's Office summoned Okubo, Director of the Bank Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, at 6:30 this morning to begin investigating. Okubo seems likely to be arrested and prosecuted by the authorities. If the head of the Bank Bureau is completely eliminated, all aspects will be greatly affected. The voice of Kato Eiichiro, the current full-time reorganization official of the Bank of Japan, is the highest for the successor to the Director of the Bank Bureau. (United Press Dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Kuroda Vice Minister's corruption problem casts a shadow on the future of the Saito Cabinet, which is indeed the case. According to some observers, after Vice Minister Kuroda is prosecuted, the Cabinet will have to resign en masse. However, the government currently has no intention of resigning en masse. Since the Diet, Vice Minister Kuroda has stated to Minister of Finance Takahashi that he is innocent. Minister of Finance Takahashi also believed this statement. Therefore, before Kuroda was imprisoned, he was unable to submit his resignation. The judiciary prosecuted him and simultaneously placed him on suspension. From this point of view, the government seems to want to watch the situation before deciding its attitude. Therefore, unless a special incident occurs, there will be no convening of the meeting of the three elders. However, it is possible that this issue will be raised at the Cabinet meeting on the 22nd, requesting a report on the truth. The Prime Minister, Minister of Finance, and Minister of Interior plan to meet informally before the Cabinet meeting to discuss this issue. (United Press Dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Privy Council's observation of the relationship between the Kuroda Vice Minister incident and the political situation is as follows: The prosecution of the current Vice Minister for corruption is a major tragedy unprecedented in previous generations. In particular, the Minister of Finance of the Bank and Corporations, etc., the Supervisory Authority, has such an incident, which is extremely regrettable. Minister of Finance Takahashi is quite indifferent to fame and wealth. Therefore, he will fully consider it before deciding whether to advance or retreat. Prime Minister Saito may concurrently serve as Minister of Finance to maintain the Cabinet. (United Press Dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<h3 id="e15">Tranquility After the Coup in Bulgaria, All Countries Pay Attention to Future Development, Germany and Yugoslavia Express Welcome, General Speculation That Bulgaria Will Leave Italy and Ally with France <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Sofia, all European countries are watching the development of Bulgaria. However, Bulgaria remains as quiet as usual. The only phenomenon since the coup is that military police and patrols consisting of two soldiers and one police officer are commonly seen in the streets of Sofia. After midnight, traffic is cut off and pedestrians are prohibited from traveling. The new Prime Minister Georgiev told a Reuters reporter today that the political and moral disintegration has reached a terrible degree, and the country is in danger of turning into an unthinkable situation. The new government's foreign policy will still follow the policies of the previous government. It is reported that Georgiev is fifty-two years old and a retired army colonel with a reputation for being strong-willed. In 1923, he was elected as a member of the House of Representatives and served as Minister of Communications in the previous government. Newspapers are still published as usual, but they have not published criticism of the dictatorship. It is reported that the government is about to issue an order to abolish various political parties. At the same time, according to Berlin news, the National Socialist Party is extremely pleased with the coup in Bulgaria, considering it another clear sign that the new era in Europe needs a government with an iron fist. Belgrade also expressed welcome to the new government in Bulgaria, believing that its main task is to eliminate the Macedonian terrorist societies and prepare to establish an alliance between Yugoslavia and Bulgaria. It is reported that the Bulgarian Ambassador to France has been summoned back home to serve as Minister of Foreign Affairs. Therefore, many believe that Bulgaria will break away from Italy's control and enter France's sphere of influence. Rome's opinions are quite divided. Some say that the coup is a surge of fascism, so it is welcomed. Others say that Bulgaria, after this coup, will be friendly with Yugoslavia and enter France's sphere of influence, which Italy is extremely opposed to, especially because the Queen of Bulgaria is the daughter of the King of Italy. If Italy loses Bulgaria, Italy's policy towards the Balkans will be hit hard, because Italy is firmly advocating the revision of the peace treaty, which is unfavorable to Bulgaria, and drawing Bulgaria into its future alliance. (Reuters Dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the establishment of the new government in Bulgaria, the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs is temporarily held by the new Prime Minister Georgiev. It will likely be taken over by the Bulgarian Ambassador to France, Badogov, who has already set off to return home. (Havas Dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>The Dawn Newspaper in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, was originally the organ of the Huan Society organized by the new Prime Minister Georgiev. Last year, it ceased publication due to lack of funds. It has now become a semi-official organ and was reissued this morning. The editorial published in its first issue specifically discusses the changes in Bulgaria's political system, stating: "Bulgaria has suffered from political conspiracies for a long time. For ten years, political conspiracies have caused the government to fall into the hands of others, and even the national character has been seriously affected. Today, it is unbearable. Several major political parties in Bulgaria only know how to seek their own party's interests and betray the political program they advocate. The government can no longer rely on them. Therefore, the people are all hoping and looking to the national army, because it is the only one that can always maintain its pure idealism. The national army has witnessed the changes in the world for many years and cannot stand idly by. It also deeply knows that in order to avoid a painful revolution, the only way is to preemptively launch a revolution by the national army itself. The national army has endured national difficulties and hardships for many years and cannot bear to see the various political parties cause even greater national difficulties. For this reason, the national army follows the will of the people and establishes a qualified and strong government, so that the various reform plans that the people have been waiting for can be implemented. After the establishment of the new government, there are hundreds of things to be done. Among them, there is one issue that the government should have the courage to resolve, that is, the issue of diplomatic relations between Bulgaria and Soviet Russia. In the future, since the internal affairs have been reformed, everything can be done boldly without fear. At the beginning of their tenure, the new government ministers began to discuss the implementation methods of their political program. All eyes are watching the new government's efforts to seek to move millions of innocent people to prosperity. Since the new government has this ambition and also has this ambition, it will surely live up to the expectations of the people." (Havas Dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<p>(London) Stephens, a correspondent for the British Daily Express stationed in Germany, was arrested near the town of Marteburg in Germany the week before last on suspicion of espionage, but was subsequently released. Stephens has now published an article in the Daily Express describing the secret construction of a military airfield near the town of Suelah in the Province of Hanover, Germany. It is not clear whether the situation he describes is directly related to the reason for Stephens' arrest. The article states that Suelah is only a few kilometers away from Hanover's commercial airport, so the construction of a new airfield nearby is specifically for military needs. The airfield is built in a forest and cannot be seen from railways or highways. Its scale is larger than the Le Bourget airfield in Paris and the Croydon airfield in London. The National Socialist Storm Troopers do not go there either. There are no aircraft parked at the airfield, because German military aircraft are currently being dismantled, and their parts are stored in various factories, ready for assembly when needed. For example, in the port of Hamburg, workers are working in three shifts day and night, using a new method to manufacture aircraft parts, which are then stored in Suelah for future use. These aircraft parts are made of a newly invented alloy. This alloy has not yet been named. It is said to soften like cardboard after being melted for about four hours. After cooling, its specific gravity is between aluminum and tin. In addition, hand grenades are currently being manufactured in factories in the port of Kiel, and 700 workers in the Glückstadt paper mill are dedicated to manufacturing explosives. Manufacturing workers must swear to keep secrets from outsiders, and violators will be punished with death, etc. (20th, Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>Athens. Prussian Prime Minister Göring and others have been warmly welcomed by the local government and people since arriving in Greece. The Greek government presented Göring with the highest medal. Göring laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier on the day of his arrival. At the same time, the Greek military band played the national anthems of both countries. The Greek President later met with Göring and others, and presented Göring with the Grand Cross of the Order of the Redeemer. In the evening, Greek Foreign Minister Maximos hosted a banquet, and the feelings between the two sides were very harmonious. This morning, 60,000 Greek citizens gathered at the Panathenaic Stadium to hold a welcoming rally for Göring. When Göring arrived, 60,000 people stood up at the same time to pay their respects. This was truly an unprecedented courtesy from the Greek people to a foreign guest. A sports meet was also held to entertain the guests.

<p>(Washington) Eighty-eight U.S. battleships and transport ships will set sail from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on May 25 and head for New York to be reviewed by President Roosevelt. This is the first time since 1932 that the 10,000 sailors of this reconnaissance fleet have sailed to the American Atlantic coast. Naval authorities estimate that the fuel consumed by this joint fleet's return to the Atlantic coast will cost approximately US$2 million. The fuel consumed for the round trip will require a total of 1,574,000 barrels of oil. After the presidential review, part of the fleet plans to sail to the East Coast and then return to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in preparation for the autumn maneuvers from September 17 to 23. Last year's exercise was held between the West Coast and the Hawaiian Islands. Naval authorities say there are four reasons for holding exercises in the Atlantic this year: (1) Withdrawing the Pacific Fleet, even temporarily, can express goodwill to Japan; (2) Comfort the grievances of the people on the East Coast; (3) Allow the reconnaissance fleet to conduct joint exercises with the battleship fleet; (4) Give officers and soldiers the opportunity for practical training to familiarize themselves with the situation in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.

<h3 id="e20">Results of U.S. Recovery Investigation, Advocate Industrial Socialism, Current Recovery Regulations Favor Large Industrialists, But Disadvantage Small Businesses and Consumers <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) The report of Mr. Tai Luo, Chairman of the U.S. Recovery Investigation Department, was submitted to President Roosevelt today. The report suggests that the socialization of industry is the only way to save the economic panic. The report is more than 80,000 words long and is based on a detailed investigation of the regulations of the National Recovery Administration. Mr. Tai Luo's main criticisms of the recovery regulations are as follows: (1) The Recovery Administration encourages monopolies and oppresses small businesses; (2) Some industry regulations are poorly implemented; (3) The recovery regulations are detrimental to consumers. The report puts forward several suggestions, advocating that the United States should adopt socialism, implement industrial control policies, and then adopt a planned economy to develop the resources of the United States. It also advocates that the implementation of industry regulations should be transferred from the Recovery Administration to the Federal Trade Commission, and that the anti-trust law should be restored, which is considered a matter of urgency. It also said that the formation of a monopoly in the American steel industry is extremely dangerous for ordinary consumers. The recovery regulations are a illusory experiment and are unable to stop rampant competition, which is harmful to some industries. Mr. Johnson, Director of the Recovery Administration, and Mr. Lei Bai, who is in charge, wrote to President Roosevelt, regarding Mr. Tai Luo's report as absurd and impractical, and advocating the abolition of the Recovery Investigation Department. (20th, National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) The National Recovery Investigation Committee released a report today, totaling 80,000 words, with some criticisms of the National Recovery Administration. This committee was established by President Luo to investigate whether industry regulations promote patents, or eliminate or oppress small-scale operators. The leader of this committee is the famous lawyer Mr. Da Luo. After its establishment, it received 113 petitions against 18 types of industry regulations and conducted investigations. The report has now been released, stating that the so-called fair competition is only an illusion. What strong producers call fair is exactly what weak competitors denounce as extremely unfair. There is no way to reconcile the views of the two sides. All competition is barbaric and cruel, and there is no such thing as fairness. The report advocates restoring the anti-trust law in order to restore competition, which is considered one of the urgent needs of the times. The report said that setting prices for industries and regulating prices by the government have the same difficulties. Managing industries to prevent price competition is a tool that the American public has long relied on to avoid the malpractices of patents, the inefficiency of businesses, and the increase in prices. However, this problem cannot be overcome in the end. The report then described various industries, saying that measures to monopolize film and television films are unscrupulous, and small-scale businesses are being oppressed. The state of steel industry patents has existed for a long time. The reason is the absolute dominance of large-scale companies. Although the American Iron and Steel Association represents large and small steel industries, in practice, its voting system allows small-scale steel industries to rely on the whims of large-scale ones and listen to their dominance. Therefore, the dominance of large companies is increasingly consolidated due to the Iron and Steel Association. The above conclusions are the opinions of the majority of the committee members. However, Mr. Xing Kelai, a writer on economics and finance, does not think so and has prepared a separate report. Mr. Da Luo and Mr. Tang Musen have additional reports, saying that forcing restrictions on production in order to maintain high prices, this kind of approach has absolutely no hope of the revival or complete recovery of small industrialists. What the American people, including small industrialists, hope for is to make good use of American resources based on socialization. If the government allows large-scale ones to maintain their interests, then this is not a planned economy, but an organization aimed at exploiting and benefiting itself. If the power of the National Recovery Administration is handed over to the Federal Trade Commission, then the public can be slightly informed of the difficulties faced by small industries in the current stage of industrial development and in the capital structure of the United States. After Mr. Da Luo's report was released, General Johnson, Director of the Recovery Administration, immediately sent a letter to President Luo to refute it, pointing out that this report was a superficial, willful and incorrect document, and advocated immediately abolishing this investigation committee because it was of no benefit to anyone, but was an organ of political law. It also said that the investigation committee was based on biased petitions and hastily judged industry regulations that had been studied and investigated by the Recovery Administration for several weeks in just a few hours. If such an organ is allowed to continue to exist, it will promote private actions and hinder the public. It is already clear that this investigation has not been able to perform its duties. (20th, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(New York) After the National Recovery Investigation Committee released its report, most newspapers criticized it. The New York Times said that the original plan of the National Recovery Administration was to formulate industry regulations for a small number of major industries, but now it has spread to all industries, which is inevitably cumbersome. This is beyond the capabilities of any bureaucratic agency. It is hoped that the industry regulations that can and cannot be implemented will be greatly eliminated in the future. The Commercial Daily said that the report of the National Recovery Investigation Committee has shown that the commentators have a left-leaning tendency. They openly advocate turning industry into a shared system. People like Mr. Da Luo, Chairman of the Investigation Committee, are almost candidates for the seat of Lenin in the United States. According to Reuters Washington, Mr. Da Luo's friends claimed today that Mr. Da Luo was not asked to defend the Yin Suer case. Mr. Da Luo did not want to be involved in legal cases again, but hoped that the National Recovery Investigation Report would be his last great work. (21st, Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>California, Wochia. Chambers of Commerce in various parts of the western United States have now overturned their previous resolutions and have decided to continue to oppose stipulating a special immigration quota for Japan. This decision was announced today by the California Immigration Committee and was supported by the American Federation of Labor. The reason is that Japanese immigration is sufficient to endanger the economic situation in the United States. (20th, National Dispatch)</p>

<p>Asuncion. The Paraguayan government announced today that 45,000 Paraguayan troops are currently deployed on the Chaco frontline, with the front line extending for 20 miles, confronting 60,000 Bolivian troops. The goal of this troop concentration is to occupy the Bolivian fortress of Baliefang, which is bound to cause a fierce battle between the two armies. (20th, National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Observers now believe that President Roosevelt's special message to Congress on the arms embargo and Senator Biddeman's proposal to impose an arms embargo on both Bolivia and Paraguay are not sufficient to immediately stop the Chaco war. However, it is hoped that this action will prompt international organizations to finally resolve the Chaco war and eliminate future wars. Whether the war can be stopped depends on the extent to which arms-producing countries are willing to implement the arms embargo and the effectiveness of this embargo after its implementation.

<p>Chicago. After the Chicago United Stockyards were burned, the fire area resembled the former Flanders battlefield in Belgium. There are now nearly 2,000 homeless people who are waiting to be fed and rely entirely on the authorities to provide relief. When the fire was raging, 2,000 police reserves were mobilized to suppress it. The authorities also summoned civil defense forces to prevent unexpected incidents. This fire destroyed a total of six warehouses, 75 workers' residences, two fire engines, three stockyards, two assembly halls, two banks, one hotel, brewery, railway office, and telephone switchboard. The flames soared into the sky, and could be seen from Indiana, 100 miles away. Three firefighters died while fighting the fire. To date, 1,500 people have been injured and treated, including 400 firefighters injured in the fire. Property losses are between 10 million and 25 million dollars.

<p>(Washington) The U.S. territories in the Far Pacific and Atlantic are now all asking Washington to reorganize their political systems. From St. Croix and Puerto Rico in the Caribbean Sea to Pago Pago Island far in the Pacific, all are territories under U.S. rule today. All are demanding autonomy, while the Philippines has already achieved independence. The Hawaiian Islands were previously pleased to be annexed by the United States, and now want to become the 49th state of the United States. Puerto Rico was the last place where Spanish troops withdrew after the Spanish-American War, and internal disputes have arisen over its future development. Republicans and socialists in the island are quite powerful and are also trying to make Puerto Rico a state of the United States of America. However, the Liberal Party tends to be independent and autonomous, advocating the establishment of the Republic of Puerto Rico. Samoa is currently governed by U.S. naval officers and is also seeking to reform its political system and change military rule to civilian rule. (20th, National Dispatch)</p>

<p>(TASS News Agency, Khabarovsk, April 22) During the first five-year plan, the Soviet Far East invested 900 million rubles in new construction. This year, socialist construction in various departments will have a broader development. The total investment this year is 1.8 billion rubles, including 474 million for industry, more than 54 million for agriculture, and 695 million for transportation and telecommunications. Geological surveys in recent years have proven that the coal reserves in the Tie'ermobulieyingse district exceed 100 million tons and are now being prepared for mining. Large iron ore deposits (approximately 500 million tons) have been discovered in the Lesser Khingan Mountains near the Bulieyingse coal area. This ore can be the foundation for the construction of a metallurgical plant at the end of the 11th five-year plan. Large non-ferrous metal and rare metal deposits have also been discovered in the Far East. The industrial development of the region is very rapid. Huge factories such as the Sibasike Cement Plant, the Sukhanovsky Shipyard, and the Khabarovsk Oil Refinery are all under construction. At the same time, electrical plants in Aoke, Heilongjiang, Khabarovsk, Nikolsk Ussuriysk and elsewhere are also under construction. A shipyard is being built on the Heilongjiang River. The multi-metal plant in Tuideke, one of the largest multi-metal plants in the Soviet Union, has started manufacturing non-ferrous metals. The progress in agriculture is also very considerable. Wheat, rice, and soybeans have been cultivated in the grasslands of the Ussuri River and the Heilongjiang River. The mechanization of agricultural labor is progressing very rapidly. The number of tillage machines used this year exceeds 19 times that of 1927. Fifty-one state-run farms for planting soybeans have been established. The Soviet coastal areas such as Sakhalin, Okhotsk, and Kamchatka are changing rapidly. Coastal areas have become fishing centers, and fishing results have exceeded seven times those of 1913. Many canned fish factories have been established. There are now quite a few state-run livestock farms. The number of deer herds has tripled in the past three years. Six scientific livestock stations have been established in the area, each covering one million hectares. The Far East timber accounts for 5% of the world's reserves. For development purposes, dozens of state-run enterprises were established during the first five-year plan. The timber harvested in 1929 was 2 million cubic meters, and in 1933 it was more than 3 million cubic meters. The development of transportation in the area is also receiving great attention. There is a regular flight between Khabarovsk, the capital of the area, and Sakhalin. The final construction of the Moscow-Khabarovsk airline will begin this year. An airline will also be opened from Vladivostok to Petropavlovsk Kamchatsky, a distance of 4,000 kilometers. The urban population of the region has doubled since the revolution. More than 500,000 workers and employees are involved in the industry of the region.</p>

<h3 id="e35">Telegram from Kashgar Refugees: Situation of Turmoil in Southern Xinjiang, Marshal Ma Shaowu's Forces Defeat the Khotan Rebels <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The representatives of Kashgar refugees telegraphed the central government, stating that the turmoil in southern Xinjiang has lasted for a year. At first, the rebels of Bogu took political reform as their goal. Although they committed many atrocities against the Han and Hui people within the customs, they still had some scruples. Later, it developed into a racial war, in which all Han and Hui people were targeted for slaughter. The surviving Han and Hui people concentrated in Akland, Shufu, Shule, Shache, and He'a counties to resist the rebels. Deaths piled up day after day, gradually decreasing the population. Only Shule City, under the command of Kashgar District Administrative Chief Ma Shaowu, led the military and civilians to fight bloody battles with the rebels, struggling to hold on until now. Shufu is connected to Shule. During the summer and autumn of last year, our army advanced several times to provide assistance, but due to the weakness of our forces, we gained and lost the territory repeatedly. At the beginning of January this year, Khotan rebel leader Hoja Niyaz, who initiated the rebellion in Kucha, indeed arrived in Shule and established a stronghold, employing Turkish adventurers to plan for him. He then established the fake state of "East Turkestan," organized a government, and issued propaganda in the hopes of breaking away from the Republic of China. He also purchased several thousand Austrian-made Water-Lian Zhu rifles and many machine guns with over 70,000 head of cattle and sheep to besiege Shule, which was extremely fierce. Fortunately, Administrative Chief Ma's command was appropriate, and after years of hard fighting, he was not able to succeed. On February 6th, he summoned Ma Zhongying's subordinates Ma Bu-yuan and others to lead their troops to Kashgar, and launched an internal and external attack, which finally defeated the Khotan rebels. Shule was relieved from the siege, and Shufu was also recovered immediately. This remaining isolated city, which is the only fruit of our struggle, has been able to maintain a few survivors. It is truly fortunate that the remaining Han and Hui people in the entire county have been able to coexist temporarily. However, the rebel forces are strong and powerful, and we are unable to completely eliminate them. We are isolated internally and externally, with no way to call for assistance. If we delay any longer, we will inevitably be annihilated by the rebels. The lives of these thousands of people are not worth regretting, but the territory of hundreds of miles may become a continuation of the four northeastern provinces. How can we not be in pain? We humbly request the government to consider the importance of border defense, to telegraph Ambassador Yan to find ways to stop the supply of weapons to the rebels and to quickly send reinforcements in the hope of completely eliminating the rebels to save us from danger and death. We are extremely grateful.

Chairman Ye Chucang presided over the meeting. Bai Yunti reported, stating that the Mongolian Political Affairs Council was established on April 23rd. He happened to be there to participate. Over 300 representatives from various Mongolian banners attended. The first meeting decided on the autonomous implementation plan for the 23rd year of the Republic, the content of which includes improving the organization of the Mongolian banners, surveying the population, establishing schools, adding police, and providing relief for the unemployed. It is also planned to establish a security team training center in Bailing Temple to consolidate the foundation of security in the Mongolian banners. However, the local economy and culture of the Mongolian banners are backward, and the finances are depleted, resulting in a large amount of produce and mineral deposits that cannot be developed and operated. In the past, various princes and dukes often levied taxes from the Mongolian people, placing a heavy burden on the people, causing the Mongolian people to be very poor. It is hoped that the central government will allocate funds so that the Political Affairs Council can gradually realize the autonomous implementation plan, and the Mongolian people will benefit greatly. As for the report that Mongolian territory is being invaded by foreign forces, the area around Bailing Temple is very peaceful. Only Duolun North and Eastern Chahar are slightly affected, but Prince De and Prince Yun are sincerely obedient to the central government, so there is no need to worry, etc. The meeting adjourned at 10:00 a.m. [Central News Agency Telegram, 21st]</p>

The cigarette tax revenue, which originally amounted to over 1.7 million yuan per month, has now dwindled to just over 1.3 million yuan per month, a reduction of 400,000 yuan.

Retail brokers were selling in the South, while industry insiders and the Far East were buying. Later, due to the lack of new developments and profit-taking by bulls, and because of favorable weather, prices fell slightly.</p>

<p>Special Dispatch from Kashgar: Following the rebellion in Hami, Xinjiang, the bandit leader Hoja Niyaz, after being defeated by provincial troops in the Zhenxi area of Hami last year, led the remnants to harass Shanshan and Turpan in the Southern Route. They fought fiercely with the provincial troops on several occasions and suffered heavy losses. Subsequently, it was reported that they had surrendered to the provincial troops. After a period of reorganization, they rebelled again, harassing Yanqi, Kucha, Aksu, and other places. They purchased a large quantity of guns and ammunition from a certain country in exchange for cattle and sheep, transported from Hara Lake to Ush-Bel to receive them. The bandits' ambitions revived, and they established a false state and organized a false government in Shufu. They sent dozens of representatives to a certain country to continue purchasing guns, ammunition, and aircraft, intending to secede from the Republic of China. In early February of this year, after being severely suppressed by Kashgar Administrative Director Ma Shaowu, the bandits scattered. Recently, they have been gathering remnants in Artush and attempting a comeback. Director Ma designed an encirclement, killing many. The latest details are revealed below:</p>
<p>After the bandit lair in Shufu was broken, the remnants retreated toward Yingjisha and Shache. On March 9, they fled to the Artush area, about 70 li from Shufu. Director Ma sent commanders Ma Fuyuan and Ma Wenli to lead troops to suppress them. After a fierce battle of about five hours, the bandit forces gradually weakened.</p>
<p>After being defeated, the Hoja bandit fled into the Hetush West Valley and was surrounded by our army. By 2 PM on the 10th, about 2,500 were killed, over 600 guns were seized, and a large amount of other military supplies was captured.</p>
<p>Due to heavy casualties, the bandit leader fled toward the border with only a few dozen followers via a small mountain path. Our army pursued and attacked, and by the evening of the 11th, the bandits entered the Great Snow Mountain. Because of the proximity to the Soviet border post, they did not dare to pursue further.

<h3 id="e109">National Finance Conference: Gao Bingfang of the Secretariat Greets Journalists and Reports on Key Conference Points <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The Secretariat of the National Finance Conference greeted the press at 3 PM on the 19th. Gao Bingfang reported: (1) The Secretariat has received a total of 75 proposals so far. The content can be summarized as "practical and detailed." In particular, the accompanying investigation forms and registers are treasures that various parties have been unable to obtain in the past. Although we cannot print them all, we will compile a summary into statistical tables and classify and display various forms, regulations, etc., in the review room for reference at any time. What is particularly admirable is that none of the experts' proposals are empty theories. They can be said to be "thorough, concise, and practical," truly applying science to the people, and are a dawn of political reform. (2) There are currently 80 registered attendees. All provinces and cities have representatives. All directors and commissioners of finance, except for one or two who could not attend due to unavoidable circumstances, have rushed to attend. The financial commissioners of border provinces such as Gansu and Ningxia have already traveled thousands of miles. The enthusiastic attendance of members also proves the importance of this conference. (3) The conference schedule has been seen in various newspapers. The intention is to focus on detailed discussions in the review committee because local finance is different from central finance, and the situation in each province is different. It cannot be "forcing conformity by mutilating" [Procrustean]. To ensure that it can be implemented, it is necessary to discuss it at length. Even the cases submitted by the Ministry only state the outline and do not harbor prejudices. We hope that all members will contribute their opinions as much as possible, and any workable method is a good method. Various proposals will be published successively, so there is no need to "jump the gun." (4) But there is one point that you often ask about and must be answered briefly. This conference focuses on reducing land tax surcharges and abolishing exorbitant taxes and levies. The provinces will certainly demand compensation. How to deal with this difficult problem? In fact, not many provinces have this request, and even if they do, it is not for this reason. Why? Because (A) the evils of exorbitant taxes are due to the poor tax laws, and the burden on the people is not equal. As long as there is a good way to reorganize, the evils will be eliminated and the tax revenue will not decrease, or may even increase the land tax. (B) The evils of exorbitant taxes lie in disturbing the people and mostly arise from poor collection methods. If the collection methods can be improved, the evils of disturbing the people will be eliminated, and the tax revenue will not be affected. For example, the various taxes collected by contractors are obvious examples. (C) Not only is extravagance in expenditure inappropriate, but also unrestricted expenditure is useless even if there is compensation. Therefore, limiting expenditure means saving money. (D) The public revenue from truly exorbitant taxes is actually not much. There is no need to worry about not being able to compensate. Cutting a large pile only reduces a small amount of money. Therefore, by reorganizing good taxes, evenly distributing the burden, eliminating corruption, and adjusting expenditure, exorbitant taxes will be abolished without being abolished. The talk of compensation is actually an excessive worry due to a lack of understanding of the situation. (5) Therefore, the goal of this conference is to focus on the active words "reorganization" and not on the passive words "abolition." This is the answer to your daily questions. (6) As for the supply of news materials for this conference, we intend to make it as convenient and quick as possible so that you will not suffer the pain of chasing. The main methods are as follows: 1. Prepare more printed materials for distribution. 2. Designate certain personnel, certain places, and certain times. 3. Whether it is a general meeting or a review meeting, anything that can be announced will be written in advance and distributed to the newspapers, which is doubly more convenient than reporters inquiring on their own. This method is both our wish and also because the meeting place is too small, so we ask you to forgive us and rest assured. The detailed methods will be discussed in detail with you by the two sections of agenda and communication.</p>

<p>Over a Hundred People Killed and Injured</p>
<p>Losses Under Investigation</p>
<p>Hong Kong Communication: The No. 1 gas holder of the Hong Kong Gas Company in Sai Wan exploded suddenly on the 15th, affecting the houses in Carron Terrace, Chentin Street, and Yu On Terrace, which were all burned down, totaling more than thirty buildings.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Gas Company Explosion</p>
<p>The number of people killed and injured is about one hundred, and many are missing. It is truly a great disaster. The disaster area was rescued by firefighters at the time, and post-disaster work began on the 16th. Firefighters, the Cleansing Bureau, and coolies cooperated to excavate, remove the bodies of those crushed, and erect scaffolding to support the collapsed houses. Work continued for several days. A total of eighty-eight injured people were admitted to the hospital for treatment and died in the hospital. Twenty-one people died in the hospital, and sixty-seven people were injured. Thirty-five people have been discharged from the hospital after recovering, and thirty-two are still in the hospital. Currently, the Hong Kong government and various charitable organizations are actively providing relief to the victims and investigating the losses in the disaster area. However, in order to prevent danger in the future, the issue of relocating the coal mine is also being discussed. It is reported that the gas holder will be moved to Sham Shui Po across the sea. The gas company has already purchased a large piece of open space in Sham Shui Po. If the relocation is realized in the future, a large gas pipe will be built at sea, roughly placed around the seawater pipe, to transport gas to Hong Kong for civilian use. The Sai Wan gas company will be used for coal storage and a small gas holder will be retained to supply gas. However, this matter cannot be realized without three years. (18th)</p>
<h3 id="e111">Budget Proposal of Fujian Province <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Annual Deficit of Over Five Million</p>
<p>Party Fees Reduced to 240,000</p>
<p>Fuzhou Communication: The local revenue and expenditure budget proposal for the 23rd year of the Republic of Fujian Province has been approved by the Provincial Government Committee. The annual revenue and expenditure difference is more than five million yuan. Although the Ministry of Finance has agreed to subsidize 3.6 million yuan annually, there is still a shortage of about 1.8 million yuan. Recently, the Minhou Tax Bureau has been trying to expand tax sources, even taxing milking cows, selling fresh flowers, selling cigarettes, and weaving towels, causing poor farmers and small merchants to oppose it. The income is still very small. The provincial government has to vigorously implement streamlining of administration. The expenses of various institutions can only be paid at most at 70%. All construction, education, and new policies are temporarily shelved. The most significant reduction is in party affairs expenses, which have been reduced from 400,000 yuan to 240,000 yuan annually, which has been reported to the Nanchang Headquarters for approval. Chen Zhaoying, special commissioner for party affairs in the province, stated that when Yang Shuzhuang was the chairman of Fujian Province, the annual party fees were set at 600,000 yuan. When Fang Shengtao was the acting chairman, they were reduced to 480,000 yuan. When Chiang Kwang-nai was the chairman, they were reduced to 360,000 yuan. Now they have been reduced to 240,000 yuan. The expenses of the provincial party headquarters alone require 12,000 yuan per month, leaving only 8,000 yuan. Distributing this to the counties is not enough, so the party affairs guidance commissioners in various districts, even though they have taken office, cannot go to work. The party affairs cadres in various counties, even though they have completed their training, cannot be assigned. The party affairs in the entire province have fallen into a state of stagnation. However, since this case was decided by the Nanchang Headquarters, the provincial government cannot change it. Chen Zhaoying decided to go to Nanjing and Nanchang within a few days to report on the situation of party affairs in Fujian Province to the central government and the headquarters, requesting that the original budget be restored, otherwise he will resign and no longer come to Fujian. The reason why the budget difference in Fujian Province this year is so large is because the newly compiled 15 regiments of the Security Corps by the Security Department require a monthly expenditure of 300,000 yuan for military pay, plus various bandit suppression fees and temporary fees, which also require 100,000 yuan per month, which was not the case in previous years. Xu Fu, the current director of finance, has decided to take the Wanhsiang steamer to Shanghai and then to Nanjing today (15th) to participate in the National Finance Conference and request relief measures from the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance.

<p>Nanchang Communication: After suffering setbacks in Guangchang, the main force of the Red bandits fled to the Fujian border. The National Army took advantage of the victory to pursue, and the bandits were scattered. On the 15th, the National Army's □th Division attacked Mazhai and encountered the 1st and 2nd Divisions of the bandit pseudo 1st Army Corps, capturing many. The text of the original telegram of victory is recorded below: (Our division attacked Mazhai, the right wing of Ma Yuanqiao on the [deleted] day, and engaged in a back-and-forth charge with the 1st and 2nd Divisions of the bandits' First Army Corps four or five times. They were finally defeated by us, capturing over a hundred bandits, seizing two light and heavy machine guns each, four pistols, several Mauser pistols, and over a hundred rifles. However, our officers and soldiers suffered slight casualties, while the bandits suffered hundreds of casualties. Xie Pufu, Xiyou Yin)</p>
<p>Also, military news: On the morning of the 15th, the 8th Column attacked and advanced toward Mazhai (about ten miles northwest of Jianning). The bandits entrenched there belonged to the pseudo 15th Army Corps, using mountain fortresses and dense forests to resist at every turn. The battle was extremely fierce. Finally, relying on the bravery of the officers and soldiers, the center of the bandits was broken through, and their left wing was also attacked fiercely. By noon, the highlands west and northeast of Mazhai were occupied by the National Army. They are currently confronting the bandits. In this battle, the bandits suffered more than a thousand casualties, and over a hundred rifles and carbines were seized, along with dozens of prisoners. (May 19th)</p>
<h3 id="e113">Active Construction of Mount Huangshan: Xu Shiying Serves as Standing Committee Member of the Construction Committee 丨Department of Education to Establish Schools on the Mountain <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Anqing Communication: Mount Huangshan in southern Anhui, known as a scenic spot in the southeast, compares favorably with Mount Lu. Recently, the Anhui Provincial Construction Department, due to the completion of the Wuhu-Tunxi and Huizhou-Hangzhou roads and the ongoing construction of the Tunxi-Jingdezhen-Yiwu roads, has made transportation convenient and travel frequent. A Huangshan Construction Committee has been established to plan development. Xu Shiying has been appointed as a standing committee member of the Huangshan Construction Committee, and he has been telegraphed to go to the mountain for on-site inspection for design purposes. Jin Youshu, technician of the department and supervisor of the Wuhu-Tunxi Road, has also been telegraphed to provide assistance. Xu Chuanyou, secretary of the department, has been appointed as the director of the resident office on the mountain and has already gone there yesterday. Currently, the Regulations for Renting Out Official Land on Mount Huangshan have been drafted and submitted to the provincial government for approval. The leased land sections are tentatively designated as Taoyuan, Yungu, Shilin, and Tianhai. The Department of Education, considering that the area of each leased land section has not been specified, but the area should not be small, will need to establish schools to provide education for the population who will reside there after the land is leased. A request has been submitted to the provincial government to order the Huangshan Construction Committee to designate a small school site in each area, requiring 40 to 60 mu of land, and to reserve an open space of 100 to 120 mu in a suitable location for large-scale summer lectures, public sports grounds, or military training and public gatherings in the future. Instructions have also been given to draw a map of the designated location and submit it to the provincial government for notification. (May 20th)</p>

<p>To Chen Min, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and Yu Jun, Commissioner of Civil Affairs: The committee meeting for this dredging project has only been held twice, and the budget contract has not yet been submitted for discussion. Construction started on March 7 of the lunar calendar and has been underway for a month. The county magistrate and district chiefs remain aloof and have not set foot on the riverbank. The water in the first section of the project is three feet deep and has never been drained. The earthwork is not being taken from the bottom of the river but is only being excavated from the slopes half a wen away from the middle waterline, causing the banks to collapse everywhere and the river channel to narrow, unable to accommodate two boats. Small dams are erected every ten zhang or so, only removing the topsoil from the water surface, leaving the water full of earthen ridges. The river workers arbitrarily pile up mud, trampling on gardens and blocking houses. The foreman does not know the names of the workers and cannot stop them. Now, most of the river workers have been dismissed, and the work is not even half done, but it has already stopped. Water is needed for farming, and delays cannot be tolerated. Local representatives have repeatedly requested the county magistrate to inspect and supervise, but he does not respond to telegrams and cannot be seen when visited. River works are fundamental to the livelihood of a place. The provincial government has actively built it and allocated a large amount of money, originally with the intention of caring for the people, but who knew that it would only become a stage for a few corrupt officials to live in luxury and divide the profits. If this is not punished, what use is the national law? In desperation, we telegraphed Your Excellency, hoping that you would be furious, quickly remove and punish them, and appoint capable personnel to inspect and supervise, ordering the completion of the work within a limited time. The local people will be fortunate. Citizens of the first section of the Songjiang River Works: Shen Diaoyang, Sun Yangxing, Zhu Boke, Wang Guchang, Gu Wenyao, Gu Yangchu, respectfully,</p>

<p>Recently, bandits have sprung up in various townships, and robbery cases have occurred frequently. Almost every day there is news of them. In Zhoujiacao, seven or eight li from the city, more than a dozen bandits suddenly came to the homes of Lu Baoquan and others at about 11 PM last night (20th). They were wearing tattered military uniforms and carrying handguns. They searched each household, threatening the victims, who dared not speak up and allowed them to plunder and leave. They then went to the homes of Shen Xiuhong, Shen Longgen, Mugen, and Guan Chang in the neighboring village of Shenxiuhong, wantonly robbing them and escaping with the stolen goods. Six houses were robbed on the same night, with losses of over a thousand yuan. The victims provided a list of losses and reported it to the Songjiang aquatic police today, requesting them to pursue the bandits and sending personnel to investigate. Also, in the Liuhe Temple area near Xinqiao, more than a dozen bandits came at about 12 PM the night before last. They spoke with a Hakka accent. They first robbed the Shen Hongsheng family, then the Cai Zhengrong, Wang Caigen, Xia Sanhe, and Wang Jusheng families, robbing for about two hours. They plundered stolen goods and, before leaving, stole a farmer's boat, loaded it, and escaped, firing several shots as a warning.</p>

<p>It is said that on the 20th, villagers in Chehe Bridge, Wuli, Chefang, held a ceremony to thank the gods and performed a play. The Fifth Squad of the Water Police stationed in Xietang dispatched 14 police officers to suppress it. It happened that the villagers there were gambling together. Because the extortion of illegal fees was not successful, they implemented a ban, resulting in a conflict. The villagers gathered and surrounded the water police. The water police fired warning shots into the air, and the villagers dispersed in panic. Unexpectedly, the Second Squad of the Second Company of the County Police and the Third Squad of the County Water Patrol, which were stationed there, rushed to investigate after hearing the gunshots. The villagers regained their courage and used huge stones to throw at the water police patrol boat. The water police fired again, injuring a carpenter named A Wu. He was taken to see a doctor yesterday (21st). Currently, this case, caused by the water police arresting gamblers outside their jurisdiction, is still under negotiation and has not been resolved.</p>

He has some savings, which are coveted by bandits. At about 12:00 pm the night before last (20th), four bandits suddenly came to Lu's house, speaking with a northern accent, each holding a pistol, wearing blue cloth short shirts and pants, looking like workers. They broke into the house, dragged Xingbao from the bed, forced him to drink liquor, and forced him to tell where the silver was hidden. Then they rummaged through boxes and cabinets, arbitrarily robbing them. The bandits were not satisfied, and went to Wang Quansheng's house in the neighboring house to rob, and burned Quansheng's face and other places with fire. After about an hour, they left with the loot, shouting and escaping. Afterwards, the Wang and Lu families checked the losses, totaling five to six hundred yuan.</p>

<p>Meiyun (nickname Dejin), the second daughter of Cheng Ziyou, a villager in Huashu Town, Jiangyin County, is currently fifteen years old. Since childhood, she was betrothed to the son of Zhao Baochu (Laqi) in the same village by her parents. She was brought into the family as a child bride. Because she could not bear the hardships of life in her husband's family, she ran away to Wuxi and lived in the home of her paternal uncle Cheng Dan'an on Wantou, outside the South Gate. Later, her father Cheng Ziyou found out and planned to take Meiyun back. Meiyun was unwilling, so she took the opportunity to jump into the courtyard of the neighboring Fang Hexing Copper and Iron Workshop, and then escaped again. When she walked near the Nanshuixian Temple, she met a woman named Zhang from the same village, who took Meiyun into her home. Zhang lived in a thatched shed behind the Nanshuixian Temple and had a lover named Zhang Dekui, who was a peddler. Unexpectedly, Dekui saw that Meiyun was beautiful, and had an improper thought. On the night of the 16th of this month, he forcibly raped Meiyun. Meiyun, feeling that she was in a difficult situation and could not live there, ran away again and stayed overnight in the Shuixian Temple. Yesterday, Zhang Dekui found out and planned to take her back again. Meiyun refused, causing a dispute. It happened that Police Chief Liu Desheng of the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau saw it and took the two to the bureau, and ordered Zhang to come to the bureau. Investigator Sun held a preliminary hearing. Meiyun confessed the experience of being raped. Dekui and Zhang denied it. Investigator Sun, seeing that the two sides had different versions of the story, ordered them to be temporarily detained together and wait for Meiyun's family to come to the case for questioning before further investigation.</p>

At about 3:00 pm, they checked the entrance of the Yongxing Rattan Shop in Zhicheng Road and saw rattan chairs and other appliances placed in front of the door. The police officers ordered them to be moved inside. Unexpectedly, the number of spectators gradually increased at this time, and a quarrel arose due to a misunderstanding amidst the noisy voices. Then they started fighting. Police Officer Xu Bin was injured in the head, and blood flowed straight down. Another police officer dragged Xu out of the siege and helped him to the bureau.

<p>More Than Several Million Spindles Were Shut Down Last Year</p>
<p>The Price of Standard Yarn Fell to More Than One Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>The Inventory of Yarn is Always Over 100,000 Bales</p>
<p>Manufacturers Met Yesterday to Discuss Remedial Measures</p>
<p>According to the Shen Shi News Agency, China's cotton industry has suffered a setback due to the dumping of Japanese yarn and rising flower prices. The National United Association of Chinese Cotton Mills specially convened a conference yesterday to discuss the situation and report on the past situation of the yarn industry. The Shen Shi News Agency reporter specially explored and recorded the details as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Manufacturer Representatives Meet to Discuss <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 pm, the United Association of Chinese Cotton Mills convened representatives from more than 40 Chinese cotton mills in this city at its clubhouse on Avenue Edward VII to hold a conference. Nie Lusheng, Xue Runsheng, Xue Chunsheng, Huang Shoumin, Guo Shun, Chen Zixin, Xu Zongtang, Chen Gengxin, and dozens of others attended. Nie Lusheng was elected chairman to discuss issues related to the improvement of the cotton mills themselves, and to make concrete remedial measures based on the current production situation. The discussion lasted until 5:00 pm. The various resolutions were not released due to various reasons.</p>
<h3 id="e135">The United Association of Chinese Cotton Mills Issues a Report <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The United Association of Cotton Mills issued a report on the past situation of the yarn industry at the meeting, stating that the world economic downturn remained the same last year. All sectors of the United Kingdom and the United States cooperated to seek salvation, and there was hope for the recovery of the Soviet Union. However, China was in great difficulty and could be in danger at any time. The economic recovery of Europe and the United States was purely based on monetary policy and trade opportunities. China's monetary and trade status was the opposite. All industries were declining, and the yarn industry was no exception. At this difficult time, it is necessary to unite and strive for survival.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Cotton Mills Across the Country Unanimously Reduce Working Hours <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Although the number of spindles increased last year, business continued to decline. The government and the cotton industry held repeated meetings to seek remedies. Since April 22, working hours have been unanimously reduced. The purpose was not to raise yarn prices, but because yarn prices were low and sales were sluggish, inventory increased and funds were accumulated, making it impossible to turn around. Therefore, working hours were reduced to reduce production in order to maintain capital. Later, in consideration of the livelihood of workers and local security, work was gradually resumed. During the free shutdown period, a total of 12 factories were completely shut down, with a total of 426,688 spindles. 4 factories were completely shut down at night, with a total of 97,288 spindles. The total reduction rate nationwide was about 23%. Production was still in excess, so there was a move to stop night work again from July 7. In the first half of last year, the number of spindles shut down exceeded half of the total number, and in the second half of the year, more than one million spindles were shut down. The severity of the reduction in working hours can be imagined.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Yarn Prices Decline and Sales Stagnate <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Since the great flood of 1931, followed by the Liaoning Incident and the Shanghai Incident, banditry has spread and the countryside has collapsed, and sales have decreased dramatically. Cotton goods have fallen even more due to excessive imports, creating the lowest level seen since the founding of the Republic of China. In the autumn and winter of 1919, the high price of 16-count Ren Zhong fine yarn was 230 taels, equivalent to 320 yuan. On April 18 this year, the price of standard cotton yarn fell to 160 yuan and 30 cents, only half of the old price. Its business slump has posed a major threat to textile factories. According to the economic sector's research on the state of domestic industry, the textile industry is the worst, especially cotton spinning. The 1934 edition fell to an index of 35%. Production needs cannot be met. In the past, the inventory of yarn in Shanghai was only 100,000 bales, but last year it was always more than 100,000 bales. Not only were funds stagnant, but it was difficult to even pay interest. Yarn merchants suffered as a result.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Prospects for the Cotton Textile Industry <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Yarn flowers are falling day by day, yarn inventories are increasing day by day, and international cotton goods are being dumped. Competition between domestic and foreign factories is becoming more and more fierce, and they are under greater threat. China's textile industry is only 20 years old, and internal and external troubles have come together. As for talent cultivation, there is only one Nantong school. As for training laborers, the factory owners have no time to settle the workers. Rationalization and scientification are difficult to achieve. Moreover, the United States is advocating a silver policy, and once it is implemented, it will put China's yarn industry in a desperate situation. Fortunately, the government is concerned and is working hard on reducing working hours, controlling and lending cotton. In the future, if we want to revive the yarn industry, we must cooperate with finance to implement low-interest loans to make up for deficiencies. We also hope that the government will increase tariffs, reduce domestic tax rates, plant cotton to enrich textile raw materials, run textile education to establish technical talents, and crack down on labor unrest to stabilize factories. Only then can it be effective.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Chairman's Address <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Today, it is a great honor for me to welcome the Qingdao Industrial Delegation to our association for a joyful gathering and conversation. All of you are the backbone of the Qingdao business community. During my previous trip to Qingdao, I may have met some of you, received hospitality, or known you well. Unexpectedly, old friends from afar are reunited here today. As Du Fu said, "What night is tonight? We share this candlelight." Not only am I personally delighted, but I believe all of you share this feeling of joy. However, your visit carries a significant mission and unlimited aspirations. The future development of North China's industry hinges on this trip, making it crucial. Therefore, you certainly cannot linger in Shanghai every day. With brief meetings and frequent departures, I hope you will generously drink a cup of wine to wish you unlimited success in the future. Shanghai is the largest commercial port in central China and a major port in the East. The situation is different from the inland. From an external perspective, the industries of both commerce and manufacturing are undoubtedly better than elsewhere. However, at the same time, the import of foreign goods and the outflow of our country's blood and sweat also make this port a major source of leakage. Moreover, due to the gathering of merchants and goods, the convenience of transportation, the clustering of foreign merchants and industries, and the observation of Chinese and foreign people, this port is implicitly the center representing China. For this reason, since the tenth year of the Republic of China, our association has strived to promote the development of domestic goods, research the improvement of production, connect the domestic goods industry, establish a commodity exhibition hall, and create domestic goods shopping malls in both the north and south, making practical publicity. Fortunately, we have not lagged behind and have received considerable recognition from the national mentality. Furthermore, with the mutual support and cooperation of various domestic goods manufacturers and merchants, we have achieved unexpected results. In recent years, the consumption of domestic goods by our compatriots has increased dramatically. The national dream is gradually awakening. This alone is a glimmer of hope for saving the nation and ensuring its survival. I also heard that since Qingdao's takeover, the sales of domestic goods have risen from zero to one-third of the city's total. After the previous domestic goods exhibition, sales even reached over 400,000 yuan, breaking the record for domestic goods exhibitions. This shows that everything depends on human effort. If we take Qingdao as an example and apply it to other places, the potential is staggering. All of this is the result of the efforts and cooperation of domestic goods manufacturers nationwide, as well as colleagues in the domestic goods store industry. It cannot be concealed. However, this only concerns a small part of domestic goods. As the saying goes, "choosing the tallest among the short" is just to comfort ourselves. If we look at the competition overseas, the amount sold today is just a grain of rice in a granary. We are in a serious international situation, suffering the pain of being cut and carved. We should not boast about our achievements or be content with small gains and willingly fall behind. Therefore, how can all of us in the industrial and commercial world not shoulder our responsibilities, unite, and strive forward? Gentlemen, you must know that compared to the world's trends, our country's industry and commerce today are like a three-year-old child racing against a flying horse. How dangerous! Taking our eastern neighbor as an example, twenty-nine countries are affected by its dumping. Recently, British colonies have even reduced the import of Japanese goods by two-thirds. There are also frequent reports in newspapers about the United States boycotting Japanese goods. With the power of Britain and the United States, their words are sure to be followed. Therefore, there is no doubt that those restricted in the West will be dumped in the East. Moreover, I fear that those who dump goods will unite the whole world to make our country the end of their competition. Sucking our marrow and blood, will our people still have intact skin? Can our country's goods and industry colleagues still steal a day of rest? Therefore, today, besides expressing my sincere welcome and admiration for your enthusiasm, I have several points I hope from you: (1) I heard that in addition to Shanghai, you will visit other ports for inspection. Therefore, wherever you travel, you will arrive in our country's major cities. In the future, I hope to have a comprehensive report on the findings, published nationwide for reference. Furthermore, gentlemen, ask about misfortune, not good fortune. During your inspection, you will inevitably see both strengths and weaknesses. The records in the report should be as accurate as possible. Then the strengths can be encouraged, and the weaknesses can be improved. (2) Our country's commerce and industry are the most underdeveloped in the world. I hope that wherever you travel, you will constantly encourage the people to work hard. It would be even better to make large-scale speeches and concrete regulations. Then, in addition to gaining inspection results for yourselves, you will receive many intangible benefits. (3) I hope to publicize the past history of Qingdao, the situation after the takeover, the current facilities, and future plans on the ground. Because there are many people who care about the Qingdao issue and want to know its current situation. The above three points are what I, in my limited view, offer to you gentlemen. I hope you will adopt and implement them. Finally, you are fulfilling your duties in the industrial and commercial world, traveling tirelessly from afar. Our association's hospitality has been inadequate, and our guidance has been lacking. I deeply regret disappointing your expectations and feel even more apologetic. As for connecting national commercial information with the industrial and commercial world to seek joint research to promote industrial progress, investing in and opening factories to promote Qingdao's prosperity, and planning to exhibit domestic goods or build a domestic goods shopping mall in Qingdao, these major issues, whether urgent or slow, are already in your plans. I will naturally follow you gentlemen. I will not elaborate further. The end.</p>

<h3 id="e152">Zhejiang Construction Department Signs Loan for Highway Construction with Four Banks. First Batch of 400,000 Yuan Remitted from Salt Industry Bank to Zhejiang, Specifically for Completing the Two Major Trunk Roads of Jingmin-Huhang-Guigui. <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Total Loan Amount 1.2 Million Yuan, Delivered in Three Phases.</p>
<p>According to Shen Shi News, Zeng Yangfu, Director of the Zhejiang Construction Department, previously received a telegram from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, ordering the construction of various highways, to be completed by the end of June, and planned to hold the Southeast Tour Exhibition on June 15th. Recently, due to the tight deadline and the urgency of the project, he specially established a road construction loan of 1.2 million yuan from the Shanghai Zhongnan, Mainland, Salt Industry, and Jincheng Banks. A Shen Shi News reporter specifically inquired with the Zhejiang provincial representatives and the four banks about the details of the signing of this loan.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Completing the Jingmin-Huhang-Guigui Highways <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Zhejiang's highways are the best in the country. The roads already built in various counties are as dense as spider webs, and transportation is very convenient. Recently, another telegram was received from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, ordering the accelerated construction of the previously designated Jingmin, Huhang, and Guigui two main lines, to be completed uniformly by the end of June. According to the Jingmin line, it runs from Nanjing through the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway to Hangzhou, and then through the Xiaoshao Road, passing through Sheng County, Xinchang, Tiantai, Linhai, Huangyan (Wenling, Yueqing, Yongjia, Qingshui, Qingtian, Ruian, Pinghai, Fenshuiguan, and connects with Fuding in Fujian Province. The total length of the entire line is 2,000 kilometers. The Huhang-Guigui line follows the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway to Hangzhou, then passes through Fuyang, Tonglu, Jiande, Shouchang, Lanxi, Qu County, Jiangshan, Guangfeng, Shangrao, Hekou, Nanchang, and reaches Guangxi. The entire route is approximately 3,000 kilometers or more. The two major trunk lines, excluding the already built highways, still require expenses of 5.2 million yuan. In addition to the 1 million yuan raised locally by various counties, 1 million yuan is borrowed from the Farmers Bank of the four provinces of Hankou, 2 million yuan is subsidized by the National Economic Commission, and there is still a shortfall of 1.2 million yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Loan Repayment and Interest Payment Method <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>This loan is entirely borne by the Salt Industry, Zhongnan, Jincheng, Mainland, and other four banks, with each contributing 300,000 yuan, totaling 1.2 million yuan. No other banks participated. The entire property of the highway is used as collateral. It was rumored that the Zhejiang Industrial Bank would bear the loan and that the Military Supplies Department would allocate 100,000 yuan per month to the province's road construction expenses as collateral. Yesterday, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank and the authorities of the four banks declared to the Shen Shi News reporter that they completely denied this. Currently, the contract has been signed by the representative Salt Industry Bank and the Zhejiang Construction Department. The weekly interest rate is 9%, and it will be remitted in three months. The first batch of 400,000 yuan was transferred by the Mainland, Jincheng, and Zhongnan Banks yesterday, each transferring 100,000 yuan, and handed over to the Salt Industry Bank for remittance to the Zhejiang Construction Department for verification and receipt.</p>

<p>treatment, feeling dragged down. The colleagues have been in Shanghai for several days and have visited major factories one after another. Seeing the perfect equipment in each factory, it proves that your association has effective leadership. The day before yesterday, all the products in the North and South City National Goods Shopping Mall of your association have surpassed imported products. However, remote and backward areas still do not have a deep understanding of national goods. I hope your association will lead exhibitions to various places to make the outside world understand. I heard Chairman Wang said three points, (1) I really dare not, (2) I will try my best to promote, (3) Please have Mr. Wu from our group briefly report. During the January 28th Shanghai War, Japan's tyranny against us, fortunately Chairman Wang protected effectively, so Shanghai's industry has the current courage, and I feel more admiration. Wu Bosheng spoke, roughly saying that various industries in Shanghai can be a model for the whole country. The industry and commerce in Qingdao are still young and are being economically invaded by the Japanese everywhere. I hope that all sectors in Shanghai will support the development in order to prosper the market situation. Finally, Dong Zhidao answered, omitting.</p>

However, the Candor aircraft remained in Shanghai and was not carried by Hawke. In addition, Miller, a National Government advisor, also went to the United States on the same ship with Hawke and others this morning.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Donggang Heji Company's Celestial Elephant Ship Sinks <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Hit Nianzi Reef Due to Thunderstorms, Wind, and Fog</p>
<p>Loss of 100,000, Passengers and Crew Unharmed</p>
<p>The Celestial Elephant ship of Donggang Heji Shipping Company, located on the fifth floor of the New Opened River Flour Exchange in the French Concession, encountered a hurricane and thunderstorm at around 4 a.m. the day before yesterday (20th) near the Tongtou Mountain north of the Wenzhou sea area, causing it to hit a reef and sink. Fortunately, the crew and passengers were unharmed. The details of the investigation are recorded below.</p>
<p>(Encountered Thunderstorms and Fog Midway) The Celestial Elephant was originally named Victory, and later belonged to Donggang Company, renamed Donggang. It was unexpected that Donggang Company suffered losses, so the creditor Zhao Yangfu and others reorganized the company, adding the word Heji, and the ship was also renamed Celestial Elephant. The ship had a load of 800 tons and was still young, sailing between Shanghai and Fujian. On the 9th of this month, it loaded passengers and cargo in Shanghai and sailed to Quanzhou and Xiamen. After unloading, it went to Ruian on the 16th to load firewood, charcoal, and groceries to Shanghai. At around 1 a.m. on the 20th, it left Ruian for Shanghai. At around 4 a.m., while passing through the sea area outside Wenzhou near Tongtou Mountain, it suddenly encountered a hurricane, and thunderstorms occurred. There was also heavy fog on the sea, resulting in the loss of driving ability. The whole ship was panicked. In a blink of an eye, the ship hit a reef on Nianzi Reef.</p>
<p>(Arrangements Before the Ship Sank) The shipowner He Shengyang and the first mate Hu Quanxing, seeing that the ship had hit a reef and the bottom of the ship was pierced, seawater was entering, and the whole ship was alarmed. Fortunately, the shipowner comforted them to be calm and not be impatient. When the sky was slightly brighter and the wind and waves were slightly smaller, the sampans prepared on the ship were lowered, first allowing the passengers and crew to leave the ship. The comprador Yang Ziting also went up the mountain with the sampan. At this time, nearby fishing boats also came to help rescue. The shipowner did not leave the ship and go up the mountain until the whole ship sank and he had no choice. The crew and passengers arrived at Ou. The entire crew of the ship was 58 people, and the number of passengers is unknown. They took their own sampans and fishing boats to escape and go up the mountain. The mountain is Tongtou Mountain, about 30 or 40 miles outside Wenzhou, about 80 or 90 miles from Ruian. After going up the mountain, it was already bright, and the stern of the ship was completely sunk to the bottom of the sea. The driving room could still be seen. When the water fell, the bow of the ship rose about three feet. The comprador Yang Ziting hired a fishing boat and first led 23 crew members to Wenzhou. Then the shipowner and passengers also arrived and went to the Siming Guild Hall to rest temporarily. A telegram was sent to Shanghai. Although the ship encountered a dangerous situation, the passengers and crew were unharmed, which can be called a blessing in disguise.</p>
<p>(Insurance and Two Telegrams) The Shanghai Donggang Heji Company received the first telegram from the comprador at 12 o'clock the night before last (20th), and received the second telegram at 1 p.m. yesterday. The ship had previously taken out a peace insurance of 30,000 yuan with the China Ship United Insurance Company at 160 Edouard Road. Therefore, after receiving the accident report, the company immediately copied the original telegram and sent it to the insurance company for formal notification. The insurance company replied by letter that the telegraph code was unclear and would be processed after the captain's report arrived. According to Zhao Yangfu, the manager of Donggang Heji Company, the aftermath of the sinking ship needs to be resolved by the insurance company, and there is no way to deal with it at the moment. The loss this time should be in the range of 100,000 yuan. The two telegrams are recorded below. The first telegram said, "Elephant (i.e., Celestial Elephant) Jia (20th) left Ruian at 1 a.m. At 4 a.m., it hit a reef at Tongtou Mountain in Beitian, and the stern sank. The crew and passengers are unharmed. Twenty-three crew members hired fishing boats to Ou. The rest are on the mountain and the deck, waiting for small boats to find a way. How to deal with this ship, reply quickly. Yang (Ziting) of Wenzhou Siming Guild Hall." The second telegram said, "Xiang Jia, at 4:10 a.m., encountered thunderstorms, wind, and fog on the Ou Mountain Pan, dark tide was rapid, Du Nianzi Reef, tide rose, see driving room, tide fell, see bow of the ship three feet, crew and passengers Ou transferred to Shanghai Yun."</p>
<h3 id="e158">The Handover of the Shanghai-Yantai-Dagu Submarine Cable Line Management Rights by the Ministry Is of Great Significance <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>There are currently two submarine cable lines between Shanghai, Yantai, and Dagu in our country, namely the famous Shanghai-Yantai-Dagu submarine cable line. Both of these submarine cable lines belong to our country. However, the Shanghai-Yantai submarine cable line and the Yantai-Dagu submarine cable line were laid by the foreign-owned Great Northern and Great Eastern Telegraph Companies with advances. Our country's previous telecommunications authorities signed contracts with the two telegraph companies, entrusting them to manage and operate them on our behalf. In order to ensure the integrity of telecommunications sovereignty, the Ministry of Communications decided to take back the above-mentioned submarine cable lines for self-operation on the 20th of this month. It had previously informed the Great Northern and Great Eastern Companies to hand over the submarine cable lines and all machinery, materials, furniture, etc. The Ministry of Communications also ordered the submarine cable line engineers stationed in Shanghai, Yantai, and Tianjin to be responsible for handling the technology and other matters related to the takeover of the submarine cable lines.</p>
<h3 id="e159">History of Operation on Behalf <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The above-mentioned Shanghai-Yantai-Dagu submarine cable lines operated on behalf of the Great Eastern and Great Northern Companies were originally established by the companies in the Gengzi year of the former Qing Dynasty. They were recovered by our country at a price in the 26th year of Guangxu, but contracts were still signed to entrust the companies to manage and operate them on our behalf. The required expenses were borne by our country. In addition, the companies were allowed to establish telegraph offices in Shanghai, Yantai, and Dagu during the period of operation on behalf, directly receiving and sending public telegrams. In recent years, the Ministry of Communications has long intended to abolish the above-mentioned contracts and take back the submarine cable lines for self-management, but it has not been realized due to various reasons. Until recently, everything was ready, and the technical preparations were also completed. The Ministry of Communications then notified the company that it would take back the management on the 20th of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Significance of the Takeover <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>The abolition of the Shanghai-Yantai-Dagu submarine cable line contract and the recovery of the management rights of the submarine cable line by the Ministry of Communications are of great significance. The Shanghai-Yantai-Dagu submarine cable line is one of the important telegraph lines between northern and southeastern China. It is inappropriate for the right to manage it to fall into the hands of others. Moreover, foreign submarine cable line companies, in our country, currently only the Great Northern and Great Eastern Companies have a telegraph office in Yantai based on the above-mentioned contract, directly receiving and sending telegrams to the public, which is a defect in our country's telecommunications. After the contract is abolished, not only will the submarine cable line be taken back for self-management, but also the telegraph office established by the company in Yantai will be closed at the same time, which is an extremely memorable event in the history of telecommunications.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Self-Managed Telegraph Office <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>After the Shanghai-Yantai-Dagu submarine cable line is taken over, its Shanghai end, which originally connected to the Great Northern and Great Eastern Company on Edouard Road in Shanghai, will be changed to connect to the Shanghai Telegraph Office on Fuzhou Road. In the future, telegrams between Shanghai and various places in the north will be received and processed by the Shanghai Telegraph Office. The Great Northern and Great Eastern submarine cable telegram receiving and sending offices under the jurisdiction of the International Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications will stop receiving and sending the telegrams from that day. In addition, it is heard that after the Ministry of Communications takes back the above-mentioned submarine cable line, it intends to install a submarine cable booster in the Yantai Bureau so that Shanghai and Tianjin can communicate directly with the submarine cable line, in order to make it particularly fast.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Incomplete Takeover <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>A Dabaisha reporter spoke with a person in charge of the Telegraph Office yesterday, saying that after our side went through the takeover procedures with the Great Northern and Great Eastern Companies, it went quite smoothly, but due to the tight time, in addition to the general negotiation matters being concluded, the takeover of the submarine cable line has not been completely completed, and it is also very troublesome technically. The day before yesterday was Sunday, and yesterday was also Danish Memorial Day, and both the Great Northern and Great Eastern Companies stopped working, so the transfer of the submarine cable line has not been completed. The rumors that there was a refusal to hand over due to certain procedures are all speculation. Currently, our side's sending lines are temporarily transmitted by the Ministry of Communications' original submarine cable lines, but the receiving and sending aspects are slightly crowded. However, it can be completely taken over within the next day or two.</p>

<p>Ningbo, 21st telegram, the body of the American pilot Colson of the missing Secos aircraft of China Aviation was recovered at 5 p.m. on the 20th by fishermen Shen Ada and others in the Gaobishan sea area of Shenshi Bridge in Cibei.

<h3 id="e164">Bean Cakes Shipped to Guangdong Detained, 200,000 to 300,000 Pieces Detained in Shantou, 400,000 to 500,000 Pieces Still in Shanghai <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Bean cakes produced by various oil pressing factories in this city are mainly sold to South China. Now, because the Guangzhou donation merchant Huifeng Company mistakenly pointed out that they are products of the three northeastern provinces and should be levied an additional fee of 8 cents per 100 catties as imported fertilizer, bean cakes shipped from Shanghai to Shantou have all been detained, totaling 200,000 to 300,000 pieces. As a result, 400,000 to 500,000 pieces of domestically produced bean cakes waiting to be shipped in Shanghai are also stagnant. The various oil pressing factories are greatly affected and are about to be closed. Now, the city Chamber of Commerce has telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Guangdong Provincial Government separately to release them. The details are as follows.</p>
<p>Bean Cake Production Volume: According to a survey by Xin Sheng News, there are six factories in Shanghai that produce bean cakes, namely Dayouyu, Changde, Dadexin, Suifeng, Changji, and Lide. There are two factories in Wuxi, Hengde and Runfeng. There is a Xie Feng factory in Changzhou, a Housheng factory in Kunshan, and an oil factory in Hankou. In total, there are 15 factories. The factories are equipped with self-made machines and are sold domestically. Guangzhou and Shantou are the most prosperous. Taking Shanghai as an example, 30,000 pieces of bean cakes can be produced every day, that is, 900,000 pieces can be produced every month.</p>
<p>Raw Materials Required: The raw materials required by each factory, namely soybeans, are all sourced from the five provinces of Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangsu. In recent years, the soybean production in the five provinces has been abundant and surplus everywhere, and the prices are extremely low. Therefore, each factory is completely supplied by them. If northeastern soybean cakes are used, they will be subject to import taxes and more transportation costs, and the cost will be expensive, which will inevitably lead to losses. For example, the soybean materials in the five provinces of Shandong, Henan, etc., the purchase price is 2.7 to 2.9 yuan per 100 catties in the market, and the average price is 2.8 yuan. In addition, the labor cost is 40 cents, and the total value is 3.2 yuan. Nine to ten catties of soybean oil can be extracted in the market, and the average of nine catties is sold at a higher price of 95 cents. Ninety-one catties of bean cake can be produced in the market, and the average of 625 pieces per genuine cake is sold at 1.38 yuan per catty, totaling 2.24 yuan. The total value of oil cake is 3.19 yuan. In this way, the income and expenditure are equal. If soybeans from the eastern province are used, the cost is 3.5 to 3.6 yuan per 100 catties in the market, and the average price is 3.55 yuan. In addition, the labor cost is 40 cents, and the total value is 3.95 yuan. Ten to eleven catties of soybean oil can be extracted in the market, and the average of ten and a half catties is sold at 1.05 yuan, and 51 catties of bean cake can be produced in the market, and the price is also 1.38 yuan, and the total value of oil cake is 3.29 yuan, that is, it will lose 66 cents. Is it reasonable for merchants to use eastern soybeans and voluntarily lose money?</p>
<p>Tax Collection in Guangdong Province: According to the original plan approved by the Southwest Political Affairs Committee, all bean dregs transported from the three northeastern provinces are regarded as imported fertilizer and charged an additional fee of 8 cents per 100 catties. That is, the Guangdong Finance Special Commissioner's Office Announcement No. 6 also stated that it is limited to bean dregs produced in the three northeastern provinces, which is a good policy to protect domestic production. Unexpectedly, the donation merchant Huifeng Company made extra profits beyond the law and forcibly pointed out that domestic products are imported products and must be taxed at 8 cents per 100 catties. The current cost of each bean cake is about 1.2 yuan, and each bean cake is nearly 100 catties. If taxed in this way, the tax will increase by 40 cents per piece, which is nearly 33% of the value. The domestic oil factories will be greatly affected, which will increase the sales of bean cakes in the eastern provinces.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Certificate: The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, after receiving the report from the Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry Association and sending the photos of the trademarks of domestic oil cakes to the meeting, immediately sent letters to the Guangdong Provincial Government, the Finance Special Commissioner, and the Youtou City Chamber of Commerce to prove it. The original case roughly stated, "After investigating the factories that manufacture bean cakes, they are all located in Wuxi, Kunshan, and Wujin counties in Jiangsu Province and within the jurisdiction of Shanghai. The soybean materials used are produced in the five provinces of Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangsu, and are taken nearby. There are factories that can be used as evidence, and the facts can be proven. Now, the attached photos and car schedules are sent to you for verification and transferred to the contractor to check one by one. The goods that were mistakenly detained should be returned as soon as possible. If it is considered that there are still matters that must be taken seriously, in the future, bean cakes shipped from Shanghai to Guangdong can be notified by our association to the Miscellaneous Grain Association to issue a certificate to prove the name of the producing factory and the origin of the raw materials. When loading goods to Guangdong each time, they should be carried with them for identification. Please check and implement."</p>
<h3 id="e165">Twenty-Four Tobacco Merchants Request Tax Rate Change (Continued) The Tax Bureau Clarifies Statistical Errors by Tobacco Merchants <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>This bureau investigated the number of stamps used. During the three-tier tax era, the average number of stamps purchased by British American Tobacco (BAT) calculated from the combined figures issued by the 合基金委員會 (Joint Fund Committee) and the former Unified Tax Bureau for fifteen months was 54,653, while other companies purchased 42,448. Thus, the quantity of cigarettes sold by BAT exceeded that of other companies by 12,205 stamps, meaning BAT accounted for 128% or more of the Chinese merchants' companies, and the Chinese merchants' companies accounted for 77% or more of BAT's sales. During the two-tier tax era, BAT purchased stamps entirely from the former Unified Tax Bureau, with an average of 51,958 stamps for fifteen months, while other tobacco companies purchased 43,582. In this era, BAT's sales exceeded those of other companies by only 8,376 stamps, meaning BAT accounted for 119% or more of the Chinese merchants' companies, and the Chinese merchants' companies accounted for 81% or more of BAT's sales. As for tax payments, during the three-tier tax era, the average amount paid by BAT for fifteen months was 2,410,408 yuan, while other tobacco companies paid 1,904,069 yuan. This indicates that BAT's ability to bear tax burdens was 506,339 yuan more than that of Chinese merchants' companies (i.e., 2,410,408 = 126, 1,904,069 = 100). In the two-tier tax era, the average amount paid by BAT for fifteen months was 2,902,474 yuan, while other tobacco companies paid 2,436,571 yuan, meaning BAT's ability to bear tax burdens was only 465,903 yuan more than that of Chinese merchants' companies (i.e., 2,902,474 = 119, 2,436,571 = 100). Comparing these two tables, the ability of Chinese merchants' companies to bear tax burdens increased, indicating that their operational efficiency improved. Therefore, during the three-tier tax era, the sales volume of Chinese merchants' companies accounted for 77% of BAT's sales. By the two-tier tax era, the sales volume of Chinese merchants' companies had suddenly progressed to account for 81% of BAT's sales. Given that Chinese merchants' companies' operations have shown such progress, the claim that the two-tier tax system hinders the business of Chinese merchants or favors foreign merchants is not an accurate assessment. (4) The original proposal listed errors in the government's unified tax losses. As mentioned above, in the comparison table of stamp usage during the three-tier era in the original submission, the total number of stamps used by BAT was not clearly verified. The 344,239.1 stamps purchased by BAT from the former Unified Tax Bureau, valued at 15,219,592.7 yuan, were mistakenly included in the number of stamps used by the Chinese merchants' companies. The original proposal continued the arguments of the original submission, and its estimation of tax revenue was based on the same fundamental point as the original submission. Therefore, the claim that the government's revenue decreased by 10,068,000 yuan and that Chinese merchants bore an additional burden of 14,520,000 yuan annually after the implementation of the two-tier tax is naturally unfounded. Now, based on the above-mentioned revised detailed table of cigarette stamp sales by grade, this bureau will provide an accurate explanation of the government's tax revenue situation at that time. It was found that during the three-tier tax era, BAT used 54,653 stamps, while during the two-tier tax era, they used 51,958 stamps. Thus, the number of cigarette cases sold by BAT during the two-tier tax era was 2,695 fewer than during the three-tier tax era, a decrease of just over 4%. If the government continued to collect taxes according to the three-tier tax rate, tax revenue would naturally decrease by 4%. BAT's average monthly tax payment during the three-tier tax era was slightly more than 2,410,408 yuan. If calculated based on a 4% decrease, the monthly reduction would inevitably be slightly more than 96,416.32 yuan, meaning BAT's monthly tax payment would only be slightly more than 2,313,991.68 yuan. However, in reality, BAT's average monthly tax payment during the two-tier era reached 2,902,474 yuan. Compared to that era, the government increased tax revenue from BAT by slightly more than 588,482.32 yuan per month, meaning an annual increase of slightly more than 7,061,787.84 yuan. Furthermore, regarding Chinese merchants' companies (i.e., the "other companies" mentioned in the original submission), they used 42,448 stamps during the three-tier tax era and 43,582 stamps during the two-tier tax era. Thus, the number of cigarette cases sold by Chinese merchants' companies during the two-tier tax era increased by just over 2%. If the government continued to collect taxes at the three-tier tax rate, tax revenue should naturally increase by 2%. It was found that the average monthly tax payment of Chinese merchants' companies during the three-tier tax era was 1,904,069 yuan. If calculated based on a 2% increase, it would only increase by slightly more than 38,081.38 yuan, meaning the monthly amount should be slightly more than 1,942,150.38 yuan. However, in reality, the average monthly tax payment of Chinese merchants' companies during the two-tier tax era was 2,436,571 yuan. Compared to that era, Chinese merchants' companies increased their tax payments by slightly more than 494,420.62 yuan per month, meaning a total increase of slightly more than 5,933,047.44 yuan annually. Based on this comprehensive calculation, in the fifteen months after the implementation of the two-tier tax, BAT's tax payment on domestically produced cigarettes increased by 7,061,787.84 yuan, and Chinese merchants' companies' tax payment on domestically produced cigarettes increased by 5,933,047.44 yuan. Considering the cigarette production of both Chinese and foreign factories, the government's tax revenue increased by slightly more than 12,994,835.28 yuan. Thus, there was no loss of government tax revenue for either BAT or Chinese merchants' companies. Considering the increased tax burden, BAT actually bore more than Chinese merchants' companies, and there was no unequal treatment between Chinese and foreign companies. (5) The original submission claimed that 19/20ths of the high-grade cigarettes were produced by BAT and that all of the low-grade cigarettes were produced by Chinese merchants, which is not factual. Regarding the domestically produced cigarettes, whether 19/20ths of the high-grade cigarettes were indeed produced by BAT and whether all of the low-grade cigarettes were produced by Chinese merchants, a correct answer can only be obtained by examining the tax-paid sales volume of all brands of cigarettes produced by manufacturers. Now, based on the most recent fiscal year under the old two-tier tax system, from July 1932 to June 1933, the tax-paid sales volume of cigarettes produced by various Chinese and foreign factories within the unified tax area is listed in order of their registered price tax bracket to form a tentative analysis (attached is a table of tax-paid sales volume of domestically produced cigarettes). Regarding the first-grade cigarettes under the old two-tier system, i.e., cigarettes of various brands with a registered price of 262 yuan or more, the total sales volume of Chinese merchants' companies was slightly more than 11,037 cases, while BAT's total was slightly more than 12,016 cases. This means that when analyzing domestically produced high-grade cigarettes between Chinese merchants and BAT, each accounted for more than 10,000 cases in sales volume, with the difference between Chinese merchants and foreign merchants being only slightly more than 900 cases, or just 9%. Therefore, the original submission's claim that 19/20ths of the high-grade cigarettes were produced by BAT can be proven untrue. Furthermore, regarding second-grade cigarettes, i.e., cigarettes of various brands with a registered price of less than 260 yuan, those priced at 260 yuan had sales of slightly more than 42,275 cases for Chinese merchants and slightly more than 37,470 for BAT; those priced at 250 yuan had sales of slightly more than 18,125 cases for Chinese merchants and only 91 cases for BAT; those priced from 249 yuan down to 240 yuan had sales of slightly more than 5,284 cases for Chinese merchants and only slightly more than 1,824 for BAT; those priced from 239 yuan down to 200 yuan had sales of slightly more than 52,843 cases for Chinese merchants and only slightly more than 8,745 cases for BAT. This means that within the second-tier tax, Chinese merchants dominated cigarettes priced above 200 yuan. However, below 200 yuan, the situation gradually changed, with those priced from 199 yuan to 155 yuan having sales of slightly more than 153,094 cases for Chinese merchants and slightly more than 185,613 for BAT. Furthermore, within the price range from 149 yuan down to 140 yuan, Chinese merchants' sales were only slightly more than 14,581 cases, while BAT's were 20,087 cases, meaning BAT prevailed. Furthermore, within the price range from 139 yuan down to 130 yuan, Chinese merchants' sales were slightly more than 47,208 cases, while BAT's were only 21,004 cases, meaning Chinese merchants prevailed. Furthermore, within the price range from 129 yuan down to 120 yuan, Chinese merchants' sales were slightly more than 117,914 cases, while BAT's were only 93,125 cases, meaning Chinese merchants prevailed again. Therefore, regarding cigarettes priced between 120 yuan and 200 yuan, Chinese merchants and BAT alternately gained and lost, which is a point worth noting. Further down, examining lower-priced cigarettes, those priced between 119 yuan and 110 yuan had only slightly more than 41,364 cases in sales for Chinese merchants, while BAT had as many as 53,170 cases. Furthermore, those priced between 109 yuan and 90 yuan had only slightly more than 22,268 cases in sales for Chinese merchants, while BAT had as many as 51,302 cases. Furthermore, those priced between 89 yuan and 80 yuan had only 2,061 cases in sales for Chinese merchants, while BAT had as many as slightly more than 19,799 cases. Therefore, BAT had more tax-paid sales volume of low-priced cigarettes priced between 80 yuan and 119 yuan. There were also cigarettes priced between 79 yuan and 60 yuan, with Chinese merchants having 1,588 cases and BAT having 54 cases. Sales for both sides were low and statistically insignificant. From the above observation, it can be proven statistically that, in the most recent year after the implementation of the two-tier tax, the sales volume of first-grade cigarettes priced above 260 yuan between Chinese and foreign companies was approximately balanced. Next, analyzing the sales volume of second-grade cigarettes, Chinese merchants sold more of those priced between 260 yuan and 200 yuan. Within the range from 199 yuan down to 129 yuan, sales volume between Chinese and foreign companies still alternately gained and lost, but within the range from 190 yuan down to 80 yuan, BAT alone had higher sales. Therefore, the original submission's claim that 19/20ths of high-grade cigarettes were produced by BAT and that all low-grade cigarettes were produced by Chinese merchants is purely speculative and not credible. As for the original submission using 65 yuan as the representative price for low-grade cigarettes and insisting on using it as the basis for calculating tax brackets, although it has been debated repeatedly, this bureau found that among the Chinese and foreign tobacco merchants who formally reported and registered cigarettes priced at 65 yuan, there were only two brands, one belonging to a Chinese merchant and one belonging to BAT, namely the 20-cigarette pack Fengmei brand from Shanghai Zhida Xinji and the 50-cigarette pack Bagua brand from BAT. However, among the twenty-four companies in the original submission, none produced cigarettes priced at 65 yuan. Furthermore, examining the sales volume, although Zhida Xinji's Fengmei brand was reported and registered, it has not produced a single case to date. According to recent investigations, BAT's Bagua brand has only had 50 cases leave the factory after paying taxes. In total, according to the registration records, there are no fewer than 1,600 cigarette brands in the second tier, and those priced at 65 yuan account for only two and their case numbers are absolutely few. Therefore, from a legal perspective, 65 yuan cannot be taken to represent the cost unit of all low-grade cigarettes, nor can it be used as the standard price for calculating tax brackets.

<p>Chen Tongfu, a native of Ningbo, 33 years old, and an employee of Fuhua Pharmacy located at No. 231 Carter Road, recently felt financially strained. He suddenly developed suicidal thoughts a few days ago and secretly took poison to end his life. Chen lived on the third floor of the pharmacy. This morning, a colleague, Fu Youlun, noticed that it was already late in the morning, but Chen had not yet gotten up. So, he went to check on him and discovered that Chen was groaning in bed. He immediately reported to the Xinzha Police Station, who dispatched detectives to investigate. They took Chen to Renji Hospital, but the treatment was ineffective, and he soon died. A newspaper clipping about the suicide of Qin Lizhai's wife and children, as well as a suicide note, were found near his body. This proves that his suicidal thoughts had been brewing for some time. The body was transported to the Fei Lun Road morgue. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor appointed by the First Special District Local Court, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the morgue to examine the body. After questioning, Chen Xifang, the deceased's brother, who resides at No. 76 Dongxinqiao and runs a pharmacy, testified that "the deceased was my younger brother. He has always been in severe financial distress. Therefore, this sudden suicide must be due to this." He also requested to claim the body. After reviewing the testimony, Mr. Guo ruled that Chen Tongfu, male, had indeed died from taking poison before his death, and authorized the release of the body to his brother, Chen Xifang, for burial.</p>

<p>China's silk industry has been affected by the dumping of Japanese silk in European and American markets, causing market prices to plummet. Silk mills in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have mostly shut down. Now, new cocoons have begun to enter the market, and cocoon prices have fallen, severely impacting the livelihoods of farmers. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e173">New Cocoons Enter the Market <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Due to climate conditions, the silkworms in Jiangsu's Wuxi, Liyang, and other areas are doing very well. Zhejiang's Shengxian, Haining, and other areas have been slightly affected. Today, the new cocoons in Shaoxing and Shengxian, Zhejiang, are priced at 25 yuan per 100 catties for the native Donggao variety. Those in Changan, Haining, are scheduled to enter the market today. Those in Jiaxing and Pinghu are expected to enter around the 27th or 28th of this month, and those in Hangzhou, Huzhou, and other areas are expected to enter at the end of this month. Those in Liyang, Jiangsu, are expected to enter at the end of this month, and those in Wuxi are expected to enter at the beginning of next month. As for market prices, although they vary from place to place, the native variety is generally priced at 20 to 30 yuan per 100 catties, and the improved variety is priced at 25 to 35 yuan per 100 catties.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Decline in Exports <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Chinese raw silk is mainly used for foreign trade. Since European and American markets have been affected by the dumping of Japanese silk, causing market prices to plummet, the silk reeled by various mills has incurred heavy losses. The current price of standard Chinese raw silk is below 500 yuan per dan, an unprecedented low. Furthermore, there are no large-scale transactions. The market in Shanghai is barely maintaining itself. Less than one-tenth of the cocoon merchants have started reeling silk, and they are operating intermittently. Considering the current market price of new cocoons and the silk market in Europe and America, it is still difficult to make a profit from collecting cocoons and reeling silk this spring. Silk merchants generally hope that Chinese raw silk will improve.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Impact on Rural Areas <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>After the new cocoons enter the market, silk merchants who collect cocoons urgently try to sell them and inevitably reel silk. Therefore, silk mills in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are about to resume operations. In Shanghai, it is currently expected that about 30 mills can start operating. However, based on the current market price of new cocoons this spring, farmers who raise silkworms will not be able to make a profit even if they have a good harvest. If they are slightly less fortunate, they will inevitably suffer losses. Therefore, the impact on the rural economy is significant.</p>

<p>Chen A'fa, a 25-year-old native of Wuxi and a chauffeur by trade, lived at No. 259 Wuding Road. He married a woman named Lu, a 19-year-old native of Suzhou. The two were initially deeply in love. However, Chen's work kept him away from home. The young Lu, unaccustomed to sleeping alone, would go out to play when her husband was away. A man named Gao Yihe, a 21-year-old native of Taizhou who was not yet married and spent his days loitering, saw Lu and was struck by her beauty. He tried every means to seduce her, and Lu also flirted with him. Soon, they became acquainted, felt deeply in love with each other, and used inns as places for their secret rendezvous. Chen A'fa, Lu's husband, heard about this but, unable to obtain solid proof, decided that moving would be a good idea. So, he moved his home to No. 49 Yongji Lane, Xinzha Road, hoping to sever the two parties' relationship. However, Lu was infatuated with her lover. On the night before last, while Chen A'fa was away at work, she summoned Gao to her home for a secret rendezvous. Unexpectedly, Chen discovered this and suddenly returned home around 4:00 AM yesterday morning. He found the adulterer and adulteress sound asleep. Enraged by the sight, Chen A'fa grabbed a kitchen knife from the table and slashed wildly at Gao's legs and Lu's lower body. The two were unable to resist and were both injured. Their cries for help attracted neighbors, who rushed over and found the man and woman lying in pools of blood. They immediately called the police, who arrested Chen and took him to the Xinzha Police Station. The injured man and woman were transported to the hospital for treatment. However, Gao died in the hospital around 11:00 AM yesterday due to his severe injuries. His body was immediately transported to the morgue for examination. Lu's lower body was also severely injured, and her life is in danger.</p>

<p>Zhang Zhou's daughter, Zhang Lamei, a 17-year-old resident of No. 357 Tangqiao, Pudong, was trafficked out last October. Wu Quanjin and Wang Yande sold her to Gong Fushan of Beicai Town, Pudong, as a daughter-in-law for 130 yuan. This year, Zhang Zhou found her and reported to the police. Wu Quanjin, Wang Yande, and others were arrested and brought to the local court. Prosecutor Yang An filed a public indictment against them for violating morality and family laws. Yesterday, Judge Zhang Peiming opened the court to hear the case. Wu Quanjin testified: "I am from Shanghai, residing at No. 44 Jianyu Lane, Haichao Temple. I am a tailor." Judge asked: "Do you know Xing Guisheng?" Wu answered: "I don't know him." Judge asked: "Do you know Gong Fushan?" Wu answered: "I don't know him. I only know Fang A'mei." Judge asked: "Do you know Yang A'bing?" Wu answered: "I don't know him." Judge asked: "Do you know Wang Yande?" Wu answered: "I know him." Judge asked: "You acted as a matchmaker for a woman sold to Gong Fushan?" Wu answered: "Wang Yande begged me, saying that there was a young lady who had been expelled by her relatives for adultery, and her mother and sister asked for a way to save her life. Later, my friend Fang A'mei happened to be at my place, and we talked about it. Fang acted as a matchmaker for Gong A'fu. The total bride price was 130 yuan, and I only received a matchmaker fee of 5 yuan." Judge asked: "Where was the money exchanged?" Wu answered: "At my home. Fang A'mei gave it to me and I gave it to Wang Yande." At this point, the Judge asked Wang Yande to testify: "I am 40 years old, from Shengxian, residing at No. 16 Shachang Street, and I am a tailor. I do not know Zhang Lamei. Xing Guitang said that there was a 17-year-old girl who had been expelled by her relatives, and her mother had remarried. This girl was acting as a matchmaker. Her mother could come to the court. We were chatting idly, not seriously. Wu Quanjin's friend, Yan A'mei, happened to be there and said that her relative wanted to go and talk about it. After several days, she claimed success, but we had to meet face-to-face and talk. We didn't want to pursue it further." Judge asked: "Have you seen her sister and mother?" Wu answered: "I saw them at the Dongjiadu teahouse. The bride price was 130 yuan, and I received a matchmaker fee of 5 yuan." Judge asked: "Where is Xing Guitang?" Wu answered: "Xing's residence on Dalianwan Road. I didn't know I would encounter this slippery matter." Gong Fushan testified: "I am 53 years old, from Nanhui, residing in Beicai Town, and I am a farmer. Fang A'mei acted as the matchmaker for Zhang Lamei. They sent her on a ship, brought her back, and married her to my son. We wrote a marriage certificate, saying that she was from the Yang family of Yangsiqiao. I do not recognize the others at all." Zhang Lamei testified: "I am 17 years old, from Shanghai, residing in Tangqiao, Pudong. On October 21st of last year, Yang A'bing, who used to be a tenant in my home, tricked me into going out to play. I called Yang 'maternal uncle.' Unexpectedly, he took me to his home at No. 11 Zhangjia Lane, where he raped me. Then, he tricked me into buying foreign cloth. He sent me to Dongjiadu and excused himself to go to the bathroom, never to return. When the ship set sail, I cried and made a fuss, but Gong took me away." Zhang Zhou testified: "I am 45 years old. Zhang Lamei is my daughter. After she was trafficked, Mr. Wang, a director of Tangqiao, said to go and take a look at Gong Fushan's home in Beicai. I went and recognized her. My daughter cried loudly, so I knew about this." At this point, the judge ordered Wang Yande to identify the woman in the courtroom. Judge asked: "Do you recognize her?" Wu said that he met her in Yizhichun. The woman said that she recognized him from a previous encounter. At this point, Fang A'mei testified: "I only recognize Wu Quanjin as the matchmaker. The rest is roughly the same." At this point, the judge ordered that the defendants be sent back into custody for further questioning.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Municipal Goods Mart previously received letters from two patriotic organizations, such as the Iron Blood and others, stating that the Beiling radio sold in the mart was not a domestic product and requesting that it be stopped from being sold. The mart then investigated and found that the Shenfeng Company in the mart sold the radio without reporting to the office at the time or submitting the radio for review, resulting in being deceived. Now that it has been discovered, in addition to immediately raising a serious question to the person in charge of the factory and prohibiting the radio from being sold, and sending people to investigate the truth, the mart deeply admires the patriotic guidance of the two patriotic organizations.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Foreign Nationals' Perpetual Lease Land Rent Changed to Direct Collection by the Finance Bureau <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>The annual rent for leased land of foreign nationals in this city was formerly collected by the Annual Rent Collection Office under the Land Bureau. It is now heard that the said annual rent has been transferred from the Land Bureau to the Finance Bureau along with the field tax for management. The Finance Bureau has issued a public notice that the rent will be collected directly by the bureau, without setting up another office for handling it. The public notice is recorded below: It is hereby announced that the collection of annual rent for leased land of foreign nationals in this city was officially transferred from the Land Bureau to this bureau for management on April 1st of this year, and will be collected directly by this bureau. The original Annual Rent Collection Office at No. 280 Beijing Road has been abolished. The municipal government has sent separate letters to the consulates of various countries stationed in Shanghai, instructing them to inform their respective foreign merchants. When paying the annual rent, foreign merchants should pay directly to this bureau with the notification issued by this bureau (address: No. 237, Municipal Government Road, South end of Qiqi Road), and a receipt will be issued. Foreign merchants may also issue checks with this bureau as the payee, together with the notification, and mail them to this bureau for collection, to simplify the procedure. However, because the annual rent receipts for this year have been printed by the Land Bureau and cannot be changed in time, the original receipts will still be used temporarily, with the seal of this bureau affixed. In addition to sending the annual rent payment notifications for this year separately, this notice is hereby issued for general information.</p>
<h3 id="e180">China Merchants Bureau Rents Various Ships from Da Zhen Company, the Handover Started Yesterday with a Term of Eight Months; Yong Ping and Yong An Sail to Shanghai and Fujian; Yong Ji Sails to Lao Yao <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>The state-run China Merchants Bureau has leased the Yong Ping, Yong An, and Yong Ji ships from Da Zhen Navigation Company to operate on the Shanghai-Fuzhou line and the Shanghai-Lao Yao line. After the contract was signed, the handover of the ships started yesterday for a term of eight months. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e181">Impact of Joint Transportation <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>The Yong Ping ship of Da Zhen Navigation Company has a total tonnage of 1,422 tons, and the Yong An has the same total tonnage as the Yong Ping. The Yong Ji has a total tonnage of 1,847 tons. It specializes in the Shanghai line. Since the implementation of joint transportation between the Longhai Railway and the China Merchants Bureau, all joint transportation goods have been loaded and unloaded at the Sun Jia Shan Wharf in Lao Yao. Therefore, the business of Da Zhen Company's Da Pu Wharf has been affected by the joint transportation, so it reduced the water freight to compete with it, but it was ultimately ineffective. There were rumors that the China Merchants Bureau was buying Da Zhen Company, but Da Zhen Company strongly denied it.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Leasing to China Merchants <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>In view of the reduction of cargo at Haizhou Da Pu Wharf and the upcoming completion of the new wharves in Lao Yao and Lian Yun Gang, the Da Zhen Company realized that in the future, the cargo of the Longhai Railway will inevitably be concentrated in Lian Yun Gang. Although the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Railways have approved the company to participate in joint transportation, the Yong Ping and Yong An are shallow-water ships and are not suitable for sailing in Lian Yun Gang. Therefore, Feng Zhen Duo, the manager of the company, contacted Liu Hong Sheng, the general manager of the China Merchants Bureau, and leased all three ships, Yong Ping, Yong An, and Yong Ji, to the China Merchants Bureau. A formal contract has been signed for a term of eight months.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Changing to Sail to Shanghai and Fujian <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau originally dispatched the Tai Shun ship to operate on the Shanghai-Fuzhou line. Because the ship has a total tonnage of 1,962 tons, and the Min River above Mawei is shallow, it cannot sail and can only dock at Luoxing Tower in Mawei, and then use barges to transfer to Fuzhou Provincial City. After the lease, it was decided to dispatch the Yong Ping and Yong An to operate on the Shanghai-Fuzhou line. Because they are shallow-water ships, they can directly reach Fuzhou Provincial City. However, the Yong Ji ship has a larger tonnage and is dispatched between Shanghai and Lao Yao to load joint transportation goods. The Tai Shun ship, which originally sailed on the Shanghai-Fuzhou line, has been changed to the Shanghai-Tianjin line.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Starting the Handover <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>After the ships of Da Zhen Company were leased to the China Merchants Bureau, all the crew members and compradors remained the same, and the expenses of the comprador on the ship were also handled as usual. The Yong Ping ship has been handed over to the China Merchants Bureau today. The shipowner held a letter from Da Zhen Company and went to the China Merchants Bureau this morning to receive the Yong Ping ship. It is scheduled to sail to Fuzhou for the first time tomorrow. As for the Yong An and Yong Ji ships, they will be handed over to the China Merchants Bureau upon their return to Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Da Zhen's Plan <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>The reason why Da Zhen Company leased all of its ships to the China Merchants Bureau this time is due to business reasons. However, the China Merchants Bureau happened to need shallow-water ships due to the problem of the Shanghai-Fuzhou line, so the deal was concluded. It is heard that the monthly rent is about more than 20,000 yuan. Da Zhen Company will not give up the Shanghai-Lao Yao line. After the establishment of the Joint Office for Joint Transportation between State-owned and Private Sectors, it will purchase two more ships ranging from 4,000 to 5,000 tons to operate on the Shanghai-Lao Yao line to load joint transportation goods. After the expiration of the Yong Ping and other two ships, it will be recovered for its own use, and the route will depend on future business.</p>
<h3 id="e186">The Garden Hotel on Qingyang Port: A New Construction on the Jinghu, Huhangyong Roads, the Hostel and Garden Are Very Convenient for Rest and Recreation <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>The Jinghu, Huhangyong Railway Administration, in view of the fact that people in Shanghai are living in a noisy environment and urgently need a place to cultivate their emotions and purify their nature in order to regulate their lives, found that the Qingyang Port area near Kunshan has a quiet scenery, free from dust, and is very close to Shanghai, with convenient transportation. It is very suitable for arranging recreational places. It sent personnel to find a Jiang family garden property on the edge of Qingyang Port, which was very suitable. Therefore, it was rented and opened as a garden hotel, so that people in Shanghai can rest and visit there at any time. The place has ancient trees, tall bamboos, strange rocks and exotic flowers, and pavilions are reflected in the flowers and trees, the grass is as green as a carpet, and the waves are as smooth as a mirror. Being in it is like entering a painting. Here you can have a picnic on the ground, fish with a rod, or drive a small boat to float in the clear water, which is enough to broaden your mind and cultivate your spirit. Regarding the accommodation and food for travelers, the hotel is clean and well-equipped, and the service is attentive, and the fees are very low. This kind of facility is really no different from opening a paradise for people in Shanghai. It is heard that the opening is scheduled for the 23rd of this month, just before the Shanghai Boat Race to be held in Qingyang Port (the competition will be held on the 26th and 27th. Those who want to cultivate their body and mind and visit the boat race should not miss it).</p>
<h3 id="e187">Revision of the Huhangyong Railway; Method of Commission for Transportation of Tea Chests <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that tea chests are one of the major transportation items on the Huhangyong line. More than 200,000 chests are transported to Shanghai by rail every year, mostly shipped from Anhui Province to the Zhakou, loaded on trains and transported to Shanghai. In order to encourage merchants to transport, the bureau previously stipulated a special commission method in the appendix to the freight car transportation rules of the Huhangyong line (officially recognized transshipment companies or private merchants who have paid a railway deposit of 1,700 yuan, and whose total annual shipment of tea chests exceeds 100,000 chests, can enjoy a 3% commission). The transportation of this tea chest has always been undertaken exclusively by Maoshuntai Company. Although the company voluntarily cancelled the official recognition and took back the deposit last year, it did not actually close down. Therefore, the tea chests last year were still transported by the company, and the total transportation volume still exceeded the prescribed amount. However, because the deposit has been taken back, it cannot enjoy the commission benefits according to the regulations. In order to prevent water transport competition, the Traffic Department intends to appropriately increase the commission and revise the previous method to the effect that all merchants who load tea chests at Zhakou, Nanxing, Hangzhou, Genshanmen, and Gongchen stations on the Huhangyong line and transport them directly to Shangbei, Shangnan, and Rihui Port, and who have first registered the brand name with the railway and paid a tea chest transportation deposit of 500 yuan, will be given a special commission at the end of the year according to the following standards. However, those who have received a special commission will no longer enjoy the general commission. The special commission stipulates that for annual transportation exceeding 50,000 chests, the commission is 2.5%; for exceeding 100,000 chests, the commission is 3%; for exceeding 150,000 chests, the commission is 3.5%; for exceeding 200,000 chests, the commission is 4%; and for exceeding 250,000 chests, the commission is 5%. This has been approved by the bureau.</p>

Other civil and criminal self-accusation cases were still tried as usual.</p>

<p>Dagong News reports that after the British-American Tobacco Company in Pudong announced the closure of the old factory on the 12th of this month, more than 3,000 male and female workers suddenly became unemployed. The Cigarette Workers' Union of the Fifth District convened representatives from the new and old factories to discuss the matter. It was decided that in order to urge the factory to realize the situation, the workers of the new factory would all go on strike from last Thursday to provide assistance. However, most of the workers in the factory had been taking turns to rest in the past few days. Yesterday, all of them went to work. More than 4,000 male and female workers in the leaf room, workshop, tin packaging room, printing department, pattern-making room, box room, tin foil room, machine room, coppersmith room, and lead room of the new factory went to the factory as usual at 6:00 AM, but after entering the factory, they all went on strike. In the afternoon, the factory side was deeply afraid of causing trouble, so it closed the factory door, so the workers did not enter the factory, but no incidents occurred.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce emailed the National Financial Conference, Nanjing Financial Conference, and transferred it to Vice Minister Qin Jingyang, the representative of the Ministry of Finance, stating that the fresh fruit tax levied in Tianjin is actually a disguised likin tax. The Chamber of Commerce has made a detailed statement from both legal and rational perspectives. The petition representatives carried the petition and submitted it to the Ministry. It was very grateful to be informed that the case would be noted at today's financial conference. The fact violates the order to abolish likin. The competent ministry should use its power and responsibility to correct it according to law. If it is still transferred to the local chief for investigation, it will inevitably protect the tax revenue and delay and conceal it in every possible way. Based on this intention, please do your best to preside over and pass the abolition of the tax at today's meeting, which is very grateful. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce bowed and said,</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Wharf Business Office has been established for more than a year. It can handle the mediation of disputes between labor and package sides on the city's wharves, the implementation of welfare undertakings, and the training of workers. Currently, the office, in view of the scattered organization of wharf workers, which easily leads to various disputes, in order to improve the organization of workers and eliminate disputes, specially resolved at the 40th standing committee of the office to start registration on April 16. It was also reported to the central and municipal party and government agencies for approval. Due to the preparation work for the start of registration being very arduous, it could not be held as scheduled. On the 19th of this month, the 42nd standing committee of the office resolved to change the start of registration to June 1st, so that the preparation work before registration can be improved.

<p>The market in the Chinese rental sector of the city is bleak, and citizens have organized rent reduction movements, requesting landlords to reduce the rent burden appropriately. It is heard that the houses in the Xiangkangli area of Baker Road, Public Concession, are managed by Xiang Mao Foreign Firm. The firm, in view of the fact that the requests of the tenants are actually due to the slack market, has now decided to take the initiative to reduce the rent first. It has informed all tenants that they will be allowed to calculate the original rent at 15% off from May of this year, and implement it to reduce the burden of the tenants.</p>

<p>The houses in Xichengli, at the intersection of Malang Road and Ximen Road in the French Concession of this port, after the owner Yiyi Company took back the management rights and managed it by itself, forced the tenants to sign harsh rental contracts. The tenants believed that the conditions of the contract were harsh and difficult to accept, and unanimously expressed their opposition. They organized the Xichengli Branch of the Fourth District Branch of the Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Federation, and negotiated with the landlord on reasonable grounds. The mediator persuaded the landlord to modify the conditions, but the landlord ignored it and, because the tenants did not sign the lease, sued Jiang Zhenfang, a tenant of No. 60, to the Second Special District Court for resisting the signing of the contract, requesting eviction and provisional execution. After receiving the lawsuit, the court summoned him on the 10th of this month and rejected the plaintiff's claim the day before yesterday. The litigation costs were borne by the plaintiff.</p>

<p>The head of the Public Concession Engineering Bureau's Health Department reported to the board of directors the day before yesterday that the depth of the artesian well was insufficient and the water quality was poor, which was detrimental to public health. The board of directors passed the regulations on drilling artesian wells, which will be implemented from June 1st of this year. The Municipal Real Estate Association believes that the content of this regulation actually aids the water company in oppressing users and increasing the water company's arrogance. Yesterday, it sent separate letters to Chinese directors Yu Qiaqing, Jiang Yiping, and Wang Yansong, requesting negotiations to cancel this proposal, in order to reduce the burden on users. The original letter said, "Dear Sirs, the Public Concession Water Company has arbitrarily increased prices, and users are heavily burdened and suffer unspeakably. After several disputes, it has rarely been effective. Fortunately, there are artesian wells to resist, which can slightly reduce its arrogance of holding the throat and demanding money. Recently, I learned that Chung Sze, the general manager of the Public Concession Engineering Bureau, in order to fulfill the agreement to aid the water company, proposed that a permit must be obtained for drilling artesian wells. If this becomes a regulation, the weapon to reduce users' water bills will be completely lost, which will make the water company increase prices arbitrarily. This matter is related to public interests, and I hereby request you to check and accept it and cancel it. The millions of residents are fortunate. Sincerely, to the Chinese directors and Chinese members of the Shanghai Engineering Bureau,"</p>

<h3 id="e204">All Cargo Lost <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>The Jinglong ship was loaded with 1,300 tons of food, flour, groceries, etc. After hitting the reef, the Xiamen Customs sent a ship to unload and store them in the customs warehouse. However, because all the cargo had been soaked in water, the food and flour had fermented. Except for the cargo on the deck, which was unloaded by the customs, the remaining cargo in the hold has now stopped unloading, because the cargo is useless and the unloading cost is too uneconomical, so it has been abandoned. The total loss of cargo is about 140,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Difficult to Rescue <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>After the Jinglong ship hit the reef, the Ship Insurance Association telegraphed Xiamen Dock to estimate the cost of rescue. The ship is still stranded on the reef. Because the bottom of the ship has been damaged, the rescue is quite difficult. According to the dock report, it will have to wait for a very high tide or flood to rescue it. The Xiamen Customs has sent a small steamship to station beside the ship. If it escapes danger, the loss will not be worth it.</p>

<p>All the crew members who were rescued were initially settled by the Xiamen agent. Now, because the Jinglong ship cannot be rescued for a while, they took the Fuping ship from Xiamen to Shanghai yesterday and reported to Hengkang Company. As for the Russian shipowner who committed suicide, he has been buried on Gulangyu. All expenses were advanced by the Russian Consul in Xiamen.</p>

Witness Guo Shang Yun stated, "I work as a court guard in this court. On the day the Gao Tao lawsuit adjourned, I only heard someone shouting, 'Don't hit, don't hit.' The official asked if he saw the beating. Guo replied that he did not see it. Afterwards, in the lawyers' lounge, I saw Tao Jia Yao vomit two mouthfuls of blood, and I don't know anything else." The official then asked the plaintiff's representative lawyer whether the plaintiff could personally appear in court. Lawyer Luo replied, "Although the plaintiff can move to the court, he cannot climb the stairs.

<h3 id="e226">Edited by the Reading Guidance Department of the Shenbao Circulation Library <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>Table of Contents (1) A Short Foreword</p>
<p>(2) This Week's News</p>
<p>(3) Special Broadcast</p>
<p>(A Short Foreword) Recently, many readers have often inquired about questions outside the scope of the department's work in their letters or conversations, such as, What is the future of China? What should I do? What about so-and-so important person? etc. These questions have all exceeded the scope of the department's discussion. According to the department's regulations, we could have chosen not to answer them. But whenever we encounter such questions, we cannot help but add some explanations so that readers who sincerely observe practical problems will not suspect that our attitude is insincere, or even think that we are avoiding something. But this is already quite troublesome. Now, in order to eliminate the barriers between readers, we have to declare to readers.</p>
<p>We have repeatedly told readers about the scope and attitude of our work. We shake hands with readers with an extremely sincere and objective attitude, standing on the position of studying learning. Whether it is a shop assistant, an apprentice, or anyone who is determined to read, we welcome them all; whatever the question, whether it is in books or closely related to books, we are willing to discuss it. To say that, of course, is not to guide readers to become bookworms, as a reader said, we are doing a bookworm-making movement. We also constantly remind readers how to combine theory and practice, but what we can do can only be limited to this. Why? First, because we believe that a person who has a foundation of social knowledge and is very concerned about the current society will not fail to understand how to deal with themselves and how to serve society. May I ask, is there anyone who is obsessed with getting promoted and making a fortune who does not know how to find money? We can fulfill our due responsibilities in the study of theory, and how to participate in practice is entirely determined by the reader themselves. We do not need to instruct, nor should we subjectively instruct. What pains us the most is that secular people are accustomed to using young people to walk their own roads, which is unfair. We are willing to be scientists, instructing some scientific truths. We are unwilling to be religious people to preach our own gospel. Second, whether it is a thing or a person, they are constantly changing and developing, and we must not evaluate them mechanically. People who were praised as loyal ministers in the past are now regarded as traitors. Therefore, for a certain thing or a certain person, we should objectively understand their growth and collapse from their own changes and from their specific manifestations. Moreover, we cannot regard a certain person or a certain thing as existing independently, but as a link in the entire social system. To subjectively and mechanically say that a certain person is good and a certain thing is bad is the most boring and inappropriate thing. Third, we ourselves are just a few people who like to read books every day, and we have no confidence that we are guides for any questions of young people, so we cannot, nor do we need to force the necessity of answering questions that we have not prepared for. Although this will inevitably disappoint some sincere readers, we are confident that we will treat people with loyalty and have a clear conscience. In terms of studying learning, we will definitely do our best to clarify any questions that we can answer. This is how it was in the past, and it will be so in the future. We hope that readers will not have too high expectations of us, nor should they be discouraged by this. We believe that our current attitude, standing in the position of an educator, is the most fair.</p>
<p>In the future, questions that exceed the scope of the department's work will not be answered, whether in writing or in person. We hope that everyone will have a calm mind to study theory and a pair of calm eyes to clearly observe reality.</p>
<p>(This Week's News) (1) How to Self-Study Social Science was delayed due to printing and only met with readers today, which is very regrettable. The original estimated price of the book was about 15 cents, but after typesetting, the number of words increased to more than 30,000, and 15 cents was not enough to cover the printing and distribution costs. There was no way but to change the price to 20 cents. We hope readers will understand. Only 1,500 copies were printed in the first edition, so buyers must buy them quickly. The general sales offices are the special distribution department of this newspaper and major bookstores in this city.</p>

<p>The reading club planned by the library has now been approved by a large number of readers, and the number of letters and applications to the library has been increasing daily. Because the library feels that the address is too small and there is no place for gatherings of more than 100 people, it has been looking everywhere for a meeting place, but it has been unable to find one. It has recently learned that the Intellectual Education Department of the Shanghai Youth Association is also preparing to open a reading club, and the association's purpose, which focuses on freedom of thought and openness of academia, is completely in line with the library's planned undertaking. Therefore, it has been agreed by both parties to merge the operations. The library's Reading Guidance Department will still send people to provide guidance on reading matters and achieve effective cooperation with the Youth Association. There will be no change in the purpose of reading. However, the Youth Association will be responsible for organizational matters in the future.

<h3 id="e229">Far Eastern Athletic Association Unexpectedly Illegally Dissolved by Japan and the Philippines, Another So-Called East Asian Amateur Athletic Association Formed, and the Invitation of Pseudo-Organizations Was Actually Approved, The Philippines' Flattering Japan is Lamentable <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Manila, 21st) Because the resolutions of the 20th conference completely failed to achieve its goals, Japan forced the Philippines to reconvene at 11:00 AM on the 21st. Our country believed that the statutory two-day meeting period had passed, and the Japanese and the Philippines had greatly pressured us during the 20th meeting, so there was no need to attend again. Moreover, we did not receive the temporary notice from the Philippines on the morning of the 21st, so our representatives did not attend. In addition to the original representatives, the Japanese consul also participated in the illegally held round table meeting. The Japanese side exerted strong pressure and proposed to dissolve the Far Eastern Athletic Association and form a new association. In order to flatter Japan, the Philippines also expressed its agreement. As a result, the Far Eastern Games, which had a history of more than 20 years, was illegally terminated by the minority opinions of Japan and the Philippines. What Japan and the Philippines decided was to form another East Asian Amateur Athletic Association A m a t e u r A t h l e t i c A s s o – c i a t i o n o f T h e O r i e n t, to hold a meeting in Japan at the end of next year to discuss holding the first conference in Japan in 1938 and the second conference in the Philippines in 1940, and to invite the Dutch East Indies, Annam, India, Malaya and other countries to participate. The Philippines still stated that, under the principle of not discussing pseudo-organizations, it hopes that China will join the new association. But our country has decided to ignore this groveling and untrustworthy ugly attitude.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Ultimately Passed with Pseudo-Organization Participation <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>(Manila, 21st Dispatch) The Philippine and Japanese representatives convened today and passed a resolution to disband the Far Eastern Games and reorganize it into the East Asia Amateur Athletic Association. They immediately voted to approve the participation of pseudo-organizations. Today's meeting of Japanese and Philippine representatives swiftly passed the previously agreed-upon proposal.</p>
<p>The Far Eastern Athletic Association has been dissolved and the East Asia Amateur Athletic Association has been immediately established. Its organizational charter is exactly the same as the Far Eastern Association, except for Article 3 regarding membership qualifications, which only requires a two-thirds majority for approval.</p>
<p>The meeting also approved invitations to China and pseudo-organizations to participate. Regarding the participation of pseudo-organizations, it was agreed that upon a request for participation from the pseudo-organizations, they would be immediately allowed to join. The new officers were selected as follows:</p>
<p>Honorary President: Quezon, President of the Philippine Senate; President: Ryozo Hiranuma, Member of the Japanese House of Peers; Vice President: Vargas, President of the Philippine Amateur Athletic Association; Honorary Secretary: Takashi Sato, Secretary of the Japan Amateur Sports Association; Charter Committee: Iranan, Professor at the University of the Philippines, Abe, Secretary of the Japan Athletic Association.</p>
<p>(Dentsu Manila Express, 21st) At 11:00 AM today, the regular general meeting attended by commissioners from Japan and the Philippines discussed the dissolution of the Far Eastern Athletic Association (F.E.A.A.). The Japanese side strongly advocated for dissolution due to the current situation, and the Philippine commissioners readily agreed. Thus, Japan and the Philippines reached a consensus on the following two points: (1) Dissolve the Far Eastern Athletic Association (F.E.A.A.) and reorganize a new Oriental Amateur Athletic Association (Amateur Athletic Association of Orient). (2) The constitution of the new association will adopt the constitution of the Far Eastern Athletic Association, with only Article 3 amended to state that (the participation of new member states requires a two-thirds majority vote of the general meeting to decide). Japan and the Philippines have agreed to invite China and other Far Eastern countries, including the pseudo-state. Next, the meeting discussed the pseudo-state's participation in the Far Eastern Association. Although the Philippines had no objection to the pseudo-state's participation, given that the Far Eastern Association had already been dissolved, they agreed that the pseudo-state should join the newly formed Oriental Amateur Athletic Association and decided to urge the pseudo-state to take steps to join the new organization.</p>

<p>(Nippon News Agency, Manila, 21st) Constitution Drafting Committee member Vargas issued the following statement regarding this matter: "Because the meeting on the 20th ended in chaos, we reconvened on the 21st and invited commissioners from China, Japan, and the Philippines to attend. However, the Chinese representative refused to attend. We have now agreed to Japan's proposal to abolish the Far Eastern Athletic Association, and with the joint assistance of Japan and the Philippines, we are determined to invite all other countries to establish a new Oriental Athletic Association."</p>
<p>(Dentsu, Manila, 21st) Chairman Vargas issued a historical declaration of dissolution at today's general meeting, which decided to dissolve the assembly. The gist of the declaration was that the Chinese side should not be formally invited to attend future meetings, considering that they would not attend at any time. No other participating country has taken this attitude. Therefore, it is believed that the Far Eastern Games have been dissolved, and Japan's dissolution proposal is acknowledged. Thus, the Far Eastern Games have come to an end at its tenth session.</p>

<p>The Foundation of Democracy Has Been Destroyed</p>
<p>The Chinese Delegation is Unwilling to Be Coerced</p>
<p>(China News Agency, Manila, 20th) During the Far Eastern Athletic Association Congress meeting on the 20th, Japan proposed amending Article 3 of the charter. After our resolute opposition, the Philippines aided the evildoer, colluding with Japan and arbitrarily changing Article 10 to allow non-member countries to join the competition. Our representatives angrily left the venue and issued the following declaration.</p>
<h3 id="e233">Declaration by the Chinese Delegation <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>The Far Eastern Athletic Association was established twenty-one years ago with the aim of promoting international goodwill among Far Eastern countries through sports. For twenty-one years, all member countries have maintained the most cordial friendship. Now, Japan is attempting to change the charter so that any new member can join without the consent of all members. The Chinese delegation feels deeply uneasy about this. If this action is carried out, it will inevitably lead to ill feelings among member countries, which is contrary to the purpose of the association. Therefore, this delegation insists that the provisions of Article 3 of the charter should be maintained, and the admission of any new member must be approved by all members. Furthermore, this delegation also finds it difficult to recognize any other modifications to the charter aimed at circumventing the basic principles stipulated in Article 3. This delegation believes that if the procedures of today's meeting are tacitly approved without objection, the fundamental principles of democracy will be destroyed. Article 14 of the charter stipulates that amendments to the charter can be made in two ways: firstly, by a two-thirds vote of the representatives of the general meeting, and secondly, by a unanimous vote of the executive committee. There is no question about the interpretation of the latter, but opinions differ on the former. This delegation believes that the so-called representatives of the general meeting refer to a two-thirds vote of all member countries, not just the representatives attending the meeting. Otherwise, amendments to the charter can be implemented with the vote of only a few members, and any two of the five member countries can agree in advance before the meeting, persuade or coerce a third country to attend, and then amend any article of the charter. The Chinese delegation absolutely refuses to be persuaded or coerced in this way, because the charter of the general meeting is the basic law of the assembly, and any modification is of great importance, even affecting the basic rights of member countries or the existence of the assembly itself. Therefore, the Chinese delegation confirms that amendments or additions to the charter should be made with great caution, with the greatest possible consensus of all member countries, rather than being passed by a minority of member countries. Therefore, Shen Siliang stated at today's meeting that if the chairman insists on forcing the amendment of the charter to a vote, China will have no choice but to withdraw from the venue to protest this illegal action. Now that the chairman intends to put the proposal to amend the charter to a vote, and the Chinese representative has already stated everything and left the meeting, the Chinese representative is already absent. This Chinese delegation considers that any subsequent amendment of the charter is not in accordance with the regulations and makes this special declaration in the hope of public awareness.

<p>(Nippon News Agency, Manila, 21st) The Far Eastern Games regular meeting began at 9:00 AM today, waiting for the Chinese representative to attend. At that time, Mr. Vargas temporarily left because he was invited by Mr. Quezon, so the issue of amending the charter progressed further. Shortly after, Mr. Vargas returned and the Philippine side suggested that instead of only amending the charter, it would be better to dissolve the Far Eastern Games and then reconvene around 11:00 AM. This was decided, and the entire meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>(Nippon News Agency, Manila, 21st) At the meeting of the New Oriental Athletic Association Establishment Committee, Mr. Abe, the Japanese representative, finally called out the names of the new officers, and the entire venue cheered to express their approval. Next, Mr. Abe expressed his opinion, stating that the dissolution of the old Far Eastern Games and the establishment of the new association and the names of its officers should be communicated to the International Olympic Committee. After the discussion, Mr. Vargas declared that the establishment of the new association was a great success and that we should look forward to its future development. Mr. Hiranuma then stated that he was very grateful for the Philippines' acceptance of Japan's wishes. The meeting adjourned at 12:40 PM.</p>

After the withdrawal, they continued the meeting and passed three draft resolutions to amend Article 10 of the charter. Because of its illegality, we naturally denied its establishment. Regarding Japan's proposed amendment to Article 3 of the charter, the Philippines will convene another meeting to discuss it at the end of this year or early next spring. We are not in a position to make any comments on this at present, but our opposition to pseudo-organizations as members remains the same.</p>

<p>The 10th Far Eastern Athletic Association Games have closed. During the last two days, the Japanese representatives openly proposed to amend the charter at the annual executive committee meeting in order to promote the participation of the pseudo-state. The general meeting decided that each of the three countries would send one representative to form a special committee to discuss it. We thought this was just a customary procedure of the meeting to gloss over the matter. Who knew that something extraordinary would happen? At the second meeting, the Philippine representative, whose attitude was critical to the survival of the Far Eastern Athletic Association, suddenly changed his neutral attitude at the round table meeting held in Shanghai and openly sided with the Japanese side, plotting to illegally amend the charter. Our country's representatives, motivated by righteous indignation, withdrew from the meeting midway, while the Japanese and Philippine representatives changed their tune, arbitrarily disbanding the Far Eastern Athletic Association, completely disregarding our country, which had always tried to safeguard the Far Eastern Games, and establishing the so-called East Asia Amateur Athletic Association. What is the reason? It goes without saying that it has another purpose.</p>
<p>Before the 10th Far Eastern Games, the Japanese Athletic Association, in order to forcibly bring in the pseudo-organization created by its imperialism, sent a special envoy to the Philippines to lobby, and then proposed to convene a round table meeting of China, the Philippines, and Japan in Shanghai to discuss it. At that time, the reason why the Philippine representative, Dr. Tan, strictly maintained neutrality, resulting in a stalemate at the meeting, was to safeguard our country's position and dignity. The reason why the Philippine representative's attitude suddenly changed at the annual meeting was a predetermined step.</p>
<p>Japan proposed that the clause in Article 3 of the charter stating that the admission of new member countries must be approved by all old member countries be changed to a majority vote. Our country naturally firmly opposed it, and the Philippine representative also pretended to be affectionate, sympathizing with our country. However, it is not known that it also sympathizes with Japan on the one hand, and that non-member countries can also participate in championship competitions. Since the Philippines sympathizes with Japan on the amendment of this article of the charter, it is clear that Article 3 of the charter is no longer effective. In this way, even if the pseudo-organization does not join the Far Eastern Athletic Association as a formal member, it can participate in official competitions. Furthermore, judging from the current political situation in the Far East and the relationship after the Philippines declared independence, the attitude of the Philippine representatives this time was absolutely instructed by another background, so they did not hesitate to take this decisive measure. It is also very obvious.</p>
<p>Although the Far Eastern Games have a history of twenty years, there are no clear regulations in the organization, relying entirely on the gentlemanly spirit of sports as the only creed. It was not until the 9th Far Eastern Games held in Tokyo in May 1930 that the existing official charter was established. The reason was that there was once an atmosphere in 1929 for Goryeo to request to join, and in order to prevent Goryeo from joining, Japan not only had to specify the charter, but also paid special attention to the fact that the admission of new member countries must be approved by all old member countries. Now that it is impossible for Goryeo to join, unexpectedly, the pseudo-organization has risen, and Japan has disregarded everything again, plotting to overthrow the provisions it previously proposed to establish, thus forming today's great waves in the Far Eastern Athletic Association. It belongs to one person to renege, and its sinister means and despicable intentions are obvious.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Dutch East Indies and Vietnam have officially joined as members. Even if the charter is amended, it only needs to be passed by a majority of members, but the representatives of the Dutch East Indies and Vietnam did not attend and declared their abstention. Since our country has opposed it, even though Japan and the Philippines have agreed, it is only two countries. This is completely inconsistent with public reason and the spirit of amending the charter. It is an oppression of the majority by the minority. After our country's representatives withdrew in righteous indignation, the Japanese and Philippine representatives disregarded the spirit of harmony and concerted efforts in the past ten years and resolutely plotted to dissolve the Far Eastern Athletic Association, illegally organizing the so-called East Asia Amateur Athletic Association, rejecting our country, the originator of the Far Eastern Games, far away, and inviting our country and the pseudo-state to participate with an objective attitude. If this is tolerable, what is not tolerable? In short, Japan is the executioner who destroyed the Far Eastern Athletic Association, and the Philippines is its executioner. Where is the spirit? Where is public reason? Since Japan and the Philippines do not hesitate to destroy the Far Eastern Games, which have been vigorously maintained for 20 years with harmony and concerted efforts, why should our country continue to believe in the creed of sportsmanship? It is time to withdraw resolutely.</p>

<p>Tan Jingjun, the general manager of Huaye Trust Company, has always had enthusiasm for sports, especially tennis. In view of the depression in the Shanghai tennis circle and the control of our country's players by Westerners, Wan Shan, tennis giants Lin Baohua, Qiu Feihai, Xu Chengji, Zheng Zhaojia, and other enthusiasts, launched the large-scale China Tennis Club, Cathay Tenois Club. The location was chosen on Singapore Road (near the intersection of Connaught Road and Little Xiasaw Road). Mr. Tan donated 14 acres of private property and invested 30,000 yuan to build the site and arrange everything. It is now ready. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e243">Purpose of Initiation <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>Throughout history, the authority of tennis in Shanghai has been controlled by Westerners, and the Shanghai Chinese Tennis Club, affiliated to the National Sports Association, has always been lifeless. In addition, the site is about to be recovered, and famous players are not enough to improve their skills, and young talents are also buried, and they are not enough to improve their technology. In view of this, this large-scale tennis club was launched. In the future, it is planned to launch more official competitions, invite famous foreign players to perform in Shanghai, and send our country's players to compete abroad, etc., to promote young players and aim to revitalize tennis in our country. The exquisite architecture of the tennis court is especially a model for the Far East.</p>
<h3 id="e244">Break Away from Westerners <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>The joint competition of the Shanghai Westerner Lawn Tennis Club will start on the 30th of this month. The Chinese team, the champion of the previous session, has already joined, but the person in charge of the club, in view of the fact that China's first-class players such as Lin, Qiu, Xu, Zheng, and Yu are all in it, actually excluded the participation of the Chinese team due to the strength of our team. Lin Baohua was very angry, so they unanimously and resolutely decided not to cooperate with the lawn tennis club and would not participate in any competitions of the lawn tennis club. In this way, the ticket revenue of the lawn tennis club will be cut off, and the economy will inevitably panic. The Chinese Tennis Club will independently host all competitions in Shanghai and invite four people to join the competitions hosted by our Chinese people in order to fight for the dignity of the tennis circle in our country.</p>
<h3 id="e245">Tennis Court Architecture <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>The tennis courts and houses are designed and built by architect Li Jinpei and carefully arranged by Tan Shuping. Four ordinary tennis courts are temporarily set up for ordinary practice. Two special tennis courts are built for competition. The construction of these special tennis courts is completely modeled after the structure of the Wimbledon Central Court in England. The two courts cost more than 10,000 yuan. This kind of tennis court is the first of its kind in the Far East. Wooden stands are built around it, which can accommodate three to four thousand spectators. They are gradually being completed. The cost has reached 30,000 yuan. In the future, it is planned to build a model clubhouse at a cost of 80,000 yuan in order to achieve perfection.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Membership Fees <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>In addition to promoting tennis, the club also plans to cover the tennis courts with canopies in winter to hold badminton competitions. Many of our country's tennis players are famous in this field. After the tennis courts and other arrangements are completed, an executive committee must be elected to strictly organize. Lin Baohua has been appointed as the secretary to preside over everything. After Xu Chengji returns to Shanghai from Manila this time, he will stay in Shanghai and will not go to Java anymore. He and Qiu Feihai are both basic members of the club. The annual membership fee for the tennis section is 50 yuan, 35 yuan for women, and 30 yuan for the badminton section. If you join both the tennis and badminton sections at the same time, the annual membership fee is 70 yuan. There are already 70 to 80 members. The future development is limitless. It is a good phenomenon in our country's tennis circle.</p>

Although there were minor twists and turns, they were resolved satisfactorily by all parties, which was a good phenomenon. Zhang Qun then delivered a speech, still encouraging the spirit of unity of the four provinces, and encouraging the athletes to work hard to train and establish merits in the Far Eastern Games.

<h3 id="e249">Zhong Ti Lian Volleyball - Fushi and Hujiang Had a Dramatic Battle Yesterday <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>There are a Total of Nine Matches Today</p>
<p>The Venue Has Been Changed to the Zhonghua Track and Field</p>
<p>The Zhongxiao Volleyball organized by the Zhongxiao Sports Federation was implemented at the Football Field yesterday. In the two groups, Zhongti, a total of six games were played. Among them, the battle between Fushi and Hujiang was the most exciting. Fushi was the champion last year, and Hujiang was the champion the year before. The two tigers met in a dangerous valley, and there was a fierce battle. Fushi has many veterans, such as Zhao Butian, Chen Zongqi, and Zhou Dayun, who have been in the field for a long time. Hujiang's advantage lies in its divine connection. Under the command of Zou Guoxiong, who is excellent at killing, there are often amazing strokes. In the first game, Fushi's momentum was strong, and it did whatever it wanted with hard shots and soft pressure. Hujiang's morale was not strong, and it had almost no ability to fight back, and it was miserably defeated with six to twenty-one. In the second game, Hujiang rose up, relying on Zou Guoxiong's fierce spikes from time to time, and reversed the situation with twenty-one to seventeen. At the beginning of the third game, the two sides fought fiercely, and it became more intense. The scores were not far apart. The situation was confusing until the scores were seventeen to seventeen. Fushi's army rose up and finally won the victory with two two to twenty. In terms of physical strength, Guanghua and Fushi are the most outstanding teams. The combat power of both sides is also amazingly strong. It is still difficult to say which group will win the championship. The women's Patriotic abstained, and Minli won without any effort. The venue will be changed to the Track and Field today. The order and results are listed below.</p>

<p>Comprehensive Review of the 10th Far East Games, Inscribed by Wu Tiecheng</p>
<h3 id="e262">Review and Prospect by Pan Gongzhan <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>Only with a healthy citizenry can there be a healthy nation. Physical education is part of education, used to train the citizens and give them healthy bodies. Education without physical education is like building a tall building on sand. Sports meets are one way to check on the physical education of the citizens. In addition to winning and losing, sports meet also cultivates the spirit of cooperation and unity, the courage to struggle, and advances them on the road to vitality and strength. Thus, in the National Games, we can see how advanced the physical education of the provinces and cities are. In the International Games, we can see how advanced the physical education of the various nations are. This is why the Far East Games are worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>Various causes in our country have yet to fully get on track, and physical education has been affected as well. The Far East Games have gone on for ten sessions to this point, and yet our country's performance in the Far East Games has declined more and more with each passing year, to the point where we are not competitive at all. Although one might say that winning and losing is unrelated to the spirit of physical education, the fact that our skills are far inferior to others is, after all, an undeniable fact. If our skills do not improve, then the advancement of our physical education will also be delayed. Thus, those who are assessing the sports meet should also assess the skills, in addition to the winning and losing.</p>
<p>Today, the tenth Far East Games in Manila, Philippines, have concluded after ten days of competition. How our country has fared, and how our skills have advanced and declined are things that we must review and inspect in order to understand the evolution of their country's physical education cause, as well as to use it as our own reference. Then we will no longer linger without advancing, and the health of the citizenry will also trend towards strength day by day. This is what all the gentlemen who are writing these assessments all hope for.</p>
<p>Moreover, I am particularly aware that before the opening of this Far East Games, the Japanese representatives presumptuously hoped to invite the puppet state of Manchukuo to participate, resulting in a foul atmosphere. Fortunately, the Philippines understood the big picture, and the games were able to take place. Unexpectedly, before the closing of the games, the Philippines actually disregarded justice and colluded with Japan to privately amend the charter, hoping that the puppet state of Manchukuo could participate in the next games. It is truly unknown what their intention is. Our country's representatives, argued on the basis of reason and withdrew from the meeting as a whole, and their attitude was very proper. But from this, we deeply feel the weakness of our national power, and that we are insulted everywhere. Only after suffering bitter lessons will the whole nation, from top to bottom, be vigilant day and night in order to seek self-improvement. Thus, the strengthening of our national physique is something we should not neglect even more.</p>
<p>Now, Shanghai China-America Tobacco Company, acting on this intention, has issued a special publication assessing the Far East Games. In addition to promoting domestic goods, they are also paying attention to the accomplishments of our nation's physical education. Their spirit is truly admirable. I secretly hope that my colleagues in the education and physical education circles can encourage each other, so that the actions of the China-America Tobacco Company will not have been in vain. Thus, I will use a few words to begin.</p>
<h3 id="e263">Track and Field By a Reporter from Shishi Daily <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— Teng Shugu</p>
<p>The track and field championships of this Far East Games have both been won by Japan. They set five new records in track events, and two new records in field events. The Philippines is also not weak. The most miserable thing is that our country still came away with zero points in the track events. Even Liu Changchun and others did not make a name for themselves in the preliminaries. The field events were a bit more comforting, and scored six points more than in the previous session. Thus, Wu Bixian's fourth place in the high jump, and Chen Baoqiu's second place in the shot put and Fu Baolu's second place in the pole vault have become topics of conversation.</p>
<p>However, this absolutely cannot be taken as optimism or satisfaction. It must be understood that our progress is still as slow as an oxcart. Compared to other countries, the difference cannot be measured in distance. We should know where our problems lie, and why other countries are advancing so rapidly. In short, it is due to the poor economic conditions in all respects (including politics, education, economics, and society), such as how Begali won first place in the 1500 meters at the Olympics, and how fascist countries have "flying legs", all because of Mussolini's encouragement. To put it feudally, Yue Fei used his spear to defeat the young Liang Wang and became the top martial arts scholar, and there is a reason for that (this saying is still extremely implicit).</p>
<p>(1) Education is not universal, schools lack forced exercise, and many are just going through the motions. Most athletes did not receive basic training in elementary school, show off in middle school, and play around in university when they feel like it. After graduation (closing time, everything is over.)</p>
<p>(2) Athletes' lives are unstable. Many take the path of physical education teachers. When their achievements are significant, they show off and become teachers, losing their amateur status.</p>
<p>(3) How many athletic fields are there in major and minor schools and towns across the country where people can feel the urge to play spontaneously? (The importance of athletic fields can be seen from the story of "Athletic King" Pasqueden).</p>
<p>(4) There is a shortage of track and field teachers who have solid experience, are very rich, and are good at teaching. Those who are boastful, do nothing in their position, and mislead students are everywhere.</p>
<p>(5) There is a lack of competition opportunities. If there are any, they are just annual sports meetings. They are just advertisements for the school.</p>
<p>(6) We rarely send people to the world track and field stage to observe, nor do we invite advanced track and field athletes from other countries to perform in China. How can we get on the right track if we build cars behind closed doors?</p>
<p>(7) Most track and field athletes have no restraint in their diet and daily life.</p>
<p>(8) They do not know how to specialize. Track and field athletes are almost all-rounders. They want to play basketball, soccer, and everything else. In order to win glory for the school, they do everything from 100 meters to 800 meters. They rarely practice regularly and often sharpen their spears before the battle. How can they get good results? (9) The social atmosphere is too bad, there are too many bad habits, and people do not pay attention to track and field. They scold the losers and blindly praise the winners, while the critics are people who do not participate in sports at all.</p>
<p>The complaints are not finished yet, and it is already late. Let's stop here.</p>
<h3 id="e264">Soccer By a Reporter from Shen Bao <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Zhenchao</p>
<p>The Far East Games soccer championship is our country's traditional possession, and every session has been ours. Other countries have the intention to get involved, but lack the ability. Unexpectedly, in the battle in Tokyo in the previous session, Japan rose up and tied our country 3-3. They did not dare to have a final match with us, so the championship was split between China and Japan, which was a great regret. In this Far East Games, our country's soccer team had great determination to wash away this shame. Sure enough, news came that they won all three matches, defeating the Philippines, then defeating the Dutch East Indies, and finally defeating Japan, maintaining the prestige of our ever-victorious army. The thing we wanted most in this session was this championship, so its value cannot be overstated.</p>
<p>Pre-Match Situation Before the match, although we had the determination to win the championship, we were worried, given the poor results of the previous session, that we would repeat the same mistakes. The Philippines knew that their strength was not to be feared, while soccer was the strength of Java, with many famous players and formidable strength. In addition to the Dutch East Indies, there was Japan. After the athletes arrived safely in the Philippines, news came that, according to the on-the-spot observation of our country's coach Huang Jiajun, the Japanese were mediocre in skills and not to be feared. Thus, the determination to win was even greater.</p>
<p>Jiang Bai's Contributions In the first match, a good news came, we defeated the Philippines 2-0. We failed to score in the first half, but in the second half, Tan Jiangbai scored with a header, opening the scoring. Li Huitang followed up with another goal. In the second match, we faced the famous Dutch East Indies Java team. They defeated Japan 7-1 the previous day. Facing a strong enemy, we could not act rashly. Some of our compatriots also played on their team. Unexpectedly, another good news came, we won again 2-0. Cao Guicheng scored first, followed by Tan Jiangbai. With the strong enemy defeated, the championship was secure. Sure enough, in the last match, we defeated Japan 4-3 again. Li Tiansheng was sent off, resulting in this situation. Tan Jiangbai scored two consecutive goals, making the score 2-0. Li Huitang followed, making it 4-3. Looking at the three matches as a whole, Jiangbai scored the most goals and was indeed our country's hero. The telegrams also stated that his performance was the most satisfying.</p>
<p>Chu Talents Use Talents Although the championship has been won by us, the most regrettable and lamentable thing is that there were five compatriots on the Dutch East Indies team. It is a truly sad thing that they cannot serve their motherland. Their soccer skills are all outstanding, and they have stated that they are happy to serve if the motherland needs them. Therefore, we hope that our country's authorities will pay attention to the talents among the overseas compatriots when selecting representatives next time. In terms of strength, the Dutch East Indies are the strongest after our country. Although they lost to the Philippines later, the score was 2-3, but the Dutch East Indies were leading 2-1 in the first half. Other situations may have caused the situation to change suddenly.</p>
<p>Rough Actions The Philippines lost to Japan 3-4 and defeated the Dutch East Indies 3-2. The runner-up was a triangular situation. The Philippines were the home team, and they had all the advantages of time and place. It is a pity that their actions were rough, barbaric, and frightening, resulting in six or seven of our team members being injured in the first match between China and the Philippines. Looking at the soccer situation in the previous Far East Games, the actions of the Philippines may also be a hereditary habit. Is this so?</p>
<p>Endurance Wins The Japanese lost to the Dutch East Indies 1-7, but were able to defeat the Philippines 4-3 and fought hard with us 3-4. Their only advantage is their endurance. Endurance is one of the most important factors in winning a competition. Success or failure all depend on the final effort. Although the Japanese were defeated by us, this is something we should emulate. In their match against the Philippines, they were behind 1-3 in the first half, but were able to score three consecutive goals in the second half and turn defeat into victory. In the match against us, when they were behind 1-3, they were able to tie the score at 3-3. Although the circumstances were different, their continuous and unrelenting spirit of struggle is where their success lies in all their causes. We should learn from this.</p>
<p>Unlimited Hope Now that we have won this championship, and washed away the previous shame, time flies like an arrow, and waits for no one. There is also the World Games and the next Far East Games. Although there is still time, it will be here in the blink of an eye. We cannot be negligent because there are still many thorns in the road ahead. We hope that the athletes who win glory for the country and return in triumph will continue to work hard and tirelessly. The future is full of hope.</p>

<p>— Zhang Shengzhi</p>
<p>When the all-around athletic events began, the games were already nearing their end. This competition was only between Japan and the Philippines. Our country sent Wang Jihai, Zhang Lingjia, and Liu Renxiu to participate in the pentathlon and decathlon. Failure was expected. However, the efforts of Wang, Zhang, and Liu were deeply appreciated by all parties, their spirit commendable, and their performance passable.</p>
<p>In the pentathlon, the Japanese army displayed its prowess, with the Philippine army following closely behind. Although our Wang Jihai worked hard for the country from beginning to end, his strength was limited, and he ultimately failed to achieve his desires. Therefore, this competition was like a solo stage for the Japanese, dominating the entire field and monopolizing the top four spots.</p>
<p>In the decathlon, the Philippines' Meyers was truly strong and skilled. It was predicted beforehand that he would win the championship. In the first half, Meyers immediately took the lead with 3698.54 points. Our Liu Renxiu was eliminated. Zhang Lingjia also occupied sixth place with 3250.65 points. In addition, Japan's Murakami, Asakuma Yoshiro, Ogura Keiji, and the Philippines' Ponsel occupied the second, third, fourth, and fifth positions, respectively. As the second half began, Meyers continued to look down upon everything and moved forward, while the others fell behind and were eliminated one after another. Jinzi Fangxiong, Qi Chenxiong, and A. Portugal, who were unknown in the first half, suddenly rose up and occupied very advantageous positions. Zhang Lingjia's poor performance in the pole vault and 1500 meters led to the abandonment of all his previous efforts, and he failed.</p>
<p>In the 1600-meter relay, the competition between Japan and the Philippines was extremely fierce. The Philippines had a clear advantage in the first three legs, leading Japan by as much as three meters. Our team lagged far behind due to insufficient strength. The final leg featured an extremely fierce competition. Japan's Masuda managed to catch up to Aranbrey. At the finish line, the Philippines won by the chest. The time was three minutes and thirty-three seconds, with the Japanese team at three minutes and thirty-five seconds, both setting new records for the games. Compared to them, we have feelings that are unbearable to look back on. However, it is hoped that the athletes will continue to work hard after returning to their country. The future is still within reach. Encourage them, and warn them.</p>
<p>The 400-meter relay can be said to be Japan's revenge battle. From beginning to end, the two sides seemed to be on the same level, with no clear distinction between them. In the end, Japan narrowly defeated the Philippine army. Our country's crushing defeat goes without saying. The time was 42.3 seconds, while the Philippines obtained 42.4 seconds. The tension of the battle can be seen from the above results.</p>
<h3 id="e266">Swimming Morning News Reporter <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— Qu Yue</p>
<p>Swimming is vigorously promoted by all countries in the world, and progress is made every year. Our country is still in its infancy in this area. Except for some talent in the coastal provinces, almost no one promotes it in the interior. It is really difficult to catch up with other countries. The reasons for this are: first, insufficient promotion; second, a lack of coaching talent; third, a lack of swimming pool construction; and fourth, a failure to conduct in-depth research on methods. With these four points, an uneven situation is formed, with distorted development and slow progress. This is an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>In the swimming championships of the Far Eastern Games, our country only won in the second session. All other years, we have fallen behind. And afterwards, we only scored slightly in the third and fourth sessions. The rest of the time, we have not been able to open up a scoring record. Although there has been progress in recent years, compared with Japan and the Philippines, it is like a thousand miles away. Moreover, our country's victory in the second session was not due to the excellence of our country's results, but because Japan and the Philippines did not yet know the importance of this sport. As of today, Japanese athletes have made rapid progress, surpassing the Philippines by a large margin. How about our country? In the 10th World Games, Japan even overwhelmed the United States (the kingdom of water) and won the world throne. Let alone the Far East? Dominating the stage, who would say it is not appropriate?</p>
<p>Although it is not appropriate to magnify the spirit of others and diminish one's own prestige, how should our country promote and develop? If this continues, not only will we not be able to compete with Japan and the Philippines, but even the desire to wash away the shame of zero points is just a dream.</p>
<p>Philippine athlete Irtaifonso has consecutively maintained the first place in the breaststroke of the Far Eastern Games for four sessions. He is truly the most glorious athlete in the history of the Far Eastern Games. Even Japan's Tsuruta and Koike, who once dominated the world stage, were defeated by him, which is really admirable. We should know that taking the highest standard as a model is not only true for swimming.</p>
<p>Promote physical fitness to strengthen the country. Ma Chonggan respectfully inscribed.</p>
<h3 id="e267">Women's Swimming News Reporter <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Meizhen</p>
<p>From our country's perspective, the most praiseworthy aspect of this Far Eastern Games is the women's swimming exhibition match. Our representative, the mermaid Yang Xiuqiong, shook the Philippines, winning three championships and winning the individual title with fifteen points. Other ladies also had good performances, almost monopolizing all the awards. This is truly one of the most glorious pages for our country in the Far Eastern Games. Our delegation has a total of four people: Yang Xiuqiong, Liu Guizhen, Chen Huanqiong, and Liang Yongxian. They are all Hong Kong female athletes who shined in last year's National Games. These four can almost be regarded as the four outstanding women swimmers in our country. Women's swimming started at 5 pm on the fifth day of the games (that is, the 16th), at the same time as men's swimming. The first day's events included the 50-meter freestyle, 200-meter breaststroke, and 200-meter relay. Japan did not participate, and only China and the Philippines competed. Our four representatives initially showed their skills and immediately made a splash. We won all three championships. Yang Xiuqiong set an excellent record of 36.93 seconds in the 50-meter freestyle. Liu Guizhen also got third, with a score of 38 seconds. Both broke the national record. The second and fourth places were for Philippine women. Yang Xiuqiong originally belonged to the first place in the 200-meter breaststroke, with a time of 3 minutes and 41.2 seconds. Unfortunately, Ms. Yang only used one hand to touch the pool wall when turning, which caused her to be disqualified. Chen Huanqiong, who was second, was promoted to first place, with a time of 3 minutes and 58.4 seconds. Liu Guizhen was second, and a Philippine woman was third. In the 200-meter relay, the competition between the two sides was extremely fierce. Liu Guizhen swam first for our side and lagged behind by one meter. Chen Huanqiong and Liang Yongxian followed and still lagged behind. Yang Xiuqiong chased hard and surpassed in the last three meters, creating a new record of 2 minutes and 41.7 seconds.</p>
<p>The next day, all competitions were stopped due to rain. They continued on the 18th. Yang Xiuqiong won two more first places. She created a time of 1 minute and 27.5 seconds in the 100-meter freestyle, overwhelming the three Philippine women. She shortened the 100-meter backstroke to 1 minute and 38 seconds. Liang Yongxian also won third place. In summary, except for the 200-meter breaststroke, the other four events broke our country's highest record. It can be seen that the progress of each person is truly commendable. In the swimming pool, because our representative repeatedly won, our national flag was raised repeatedly, and the national anthem was played repeatedly. The audience applauded non-stop, and they obtained supreme glory. When our representatives first arrived in the Philippines, the Filipinos made boring criticisms, saying that our representatives came to compete for beauty. At this point, the Filipinos began to look at each other in shock and praised them as "Miss China." Women's swimming will be changed to a championship event in the next session. It has been decided at the Swimming Committee meeting on the 18th, but it still needs to be submitted to the Executive Committee of the Far Eastern Games for discussion. It will most likely become a reality. Then our female athletes must continue to work hard, prepare for the next competition, maintain the existing hegemony, and the honor of the country will also be involved.</p>
<h3 id="e268">Illegal Organization Shen Bao Reporter <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Daosheng</p>
<p>According to a Manila Express dispatch from the Datong News Agency on the 21st, the so-called Far Eastern Games, which occupy a page in history, was actually dissolved in a private meeting between Japan and the Philippines, and they will engage in a new organization called the Oriental Amateur Sports Association. This illegal production is not worth a smile from those who know it. From the standpoint of sports ethics, there is no room for foothold. In order to respect the spirit of independence, we will not hesitate to bid farewell to the Far Eastern Games. However, before it is officially announced, we still hope that the Philippines can realize this.</p>
<h3 id="e269">Baseball Min Bao Reporter <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Huiqing</p>
<p>In the ten sessions of the Far Eastern Games, the baseball championship has never been won. The reason is that the sport is complex, the rules are difficult to understand, and it is rich in scientific thought and adventurous spirit, which are all weaknesses of our national character. It is appropriate that it cannot be developed. Although Hong Kong and Guangdong are the birthplaces of baseball in our country, compared with the technology of other ball games, it is still far away.</p>
<p>In the eighth and ninth Far Eastern Games, our country was represented by overseas Chinese from Honolulu who returned to the country. Although they failed to defeat Japan and win the championship, they were able to defeat the Philippines and occupy the runner-up position, which was already commendable. This year, the Honolulu overseas Chinese were unable to attend due to the urgency of time, which is regrettable. Therefore, personnel were selected from Hong Kong, Guangdong, and Shanghai to make up the numbers, only seeking to muddle through and show their faces. It would be enough to have a good performance.</p>
<p>After suffering a crushing defeat in the previous two sessions, the Philippines strengthened its determination to retaliate and avenge its shame. The Philippine Sports Association has always considered players from the professional league to be amateur players. This year, they suddenly recognized them as amateur players. Therefore, they selected elite representatives from each team in the league, so that Japan, which regards it as a "national sport," had to admit defeat. The sophistication of its pitching technology is truly the fatal wound of the Japanese team.</p>
<p>In the first match between the Philippines and Japan, Japan was completely defeated with a score of zero to seven, and it did not even have many opportunities to reach second base. The tightness of the Philippine team's formation and defense, the skill of the pitcher's technology, and the accuracy of the batting are all evident here. In the second match between the Philippines and Japan, Japan tried its best to cheer up, but it ended in a 2-2 tie in two innings. The match was terminated due to darkness. Therefore, the championship was won by the Philippines.</p>
<h3 id="e270">Tennis Morning News Reporter <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Ruzhuo</p>
<p>In the ten sessions of the Far Eastern Games to date, except for the eighth session, when our country once won the tennis championship, and the last session, when it finished as runner-up, the rest have failed. This shows how difficult it is to get involved. Before the athletes set off this year, it was heard that a certain player was newly married and reluctant to leave for even a moment, and that someone else was residing abroad and would represent the local area to attend, turning against us. Such a downturn makes people know that hope is extremely slim.</p>
<p>After that, they barely managed to make the trip. Unexpectedly, as soon as the knockout round began, one pair suffered a defeat to Japan with a score of one to four, "dying halfway." The only point they had was won against a third-rate player. Although today (the reporter is writing this article in the middle of the night on the 20th), the final between Japan and the Philippines has not completely ended, the Philippines has already won one singles and one doubles match, occupying an extreme advantage. This is unexpected. After examination, the Philippine representative, Mr. Cavia, came to challenge with the famous Baolin last summer. Cavia lost to Qiu Feihai and won against Lin Baohua. Lin and Qiu won all the doubles matches. Unexpectedly, in less than a year, the results have advanced so dramatically. Young and handsome, his future is immeasurable.</p>
<p>Looking back at our country's sports, everything is going backwards and going bankrupt. In the past, we were still able to deal with people and bring out our strengths in one or two areas. Now, we only get one championship, and things are getting worse and worse. The past is gone, but the future is still within reach. If we want to seek the development of sports, the progress of all sports, wash away the shame of the Far East, and step onto the world stage, we should urgently make a fundamental plan, so that we can achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<h3 id="e271">Exhibition Shen Bao Reporter <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Huaiqing</p>
<p>Women's Volleyball Women's volleyball at the Far Eastern Games has always been of an exhibition nature, not counting towards championships. In terms of the skills of China, the Philippines, and Japan in the past, Japan has been invincible and always wins the championship. The Philippines has never been our opponent, and our country has always been defeated by Japan. This time, Japan did not send a team to attend, so it became a confrontation between China and the Philippines. The winner was decided by winning two out of three matches. Our country actually lost both matches, opening up a new record for our country's women's volleyball team losing to the Philippines.</p>
<p>Looking at the situation of the two matches, the difference between victory and defeat was extremely small, and the competition was extremely fierce, which proves that the strengths were average and can be called evenly matched. However, our team's selection was combined in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Guangdong. The individual skills are excellent, but there was a lack of practice beforehand and they could not respond to each other. Moreover, panic on the spot was a major drawback. In addition, the Philippine team belonged to the host country, and in view of the previous failures, they strengthened their determination to train diligently in order to seek revenge and avenge their shame. Therefore, our team was defeated. This sport will be changed to a formal championship from the next session, so our country should prepare for a long time and sharpen its swords.</p>
<p>Women's Tennis Our country's men's tennis is still so young. Let alone women's tennis. There is a lack of guidance. Few competitions are held in various places, and it is difficult to cultivate talents. Although there has been progress in recent years, the gap between us and Japan and the Philippines is huge. Although the representatives sent by our country this time are the best in the country, they are only enough to show the immaturity of our country's technology and the lack of talent. From the next session, this sport will also be changed to a formal championship, and strengthening military preparations cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Shooting Range The Far Eastern Games has a shooting range since this session. Only our country and the Philippines participated, with a total of four types of events: pistol and rifle individual and team competitions. Except for Yang Wenqing winning the pistol individual shooting competition, all the others were defeated. This sport will be listed as a formal championship event from the next Far Eastern Games, following the example of the World Olympic Games. Many Chinese members of the Shanghai International Business Group are skilled, and have repeatedly won in Shanghai. There is great hope in the future.</p>
<p>Boxing Our country's national martial arts, restricted by rules, is difficult to dominate the world stage. The lack of promotion of Western boxing is regrettable. From the next session, boxing has been included as a formal championship item. According to the current situation in our country, we will not be eligible to attend for a lifetime. Only wrestling is enough for competition with other countries. Boxing in Japan and the Philippines is extremely developed. There have been good performances in previous public competitions. Our country's authorities should actively promote it, which is a matter of urgency.</p>
<h3 id="e272">Volleyball News Reporter <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— Pei Shunyuan</p>
<p>In this Far Eastern Games volleyball championship, the Philippines won the championship with three wins and one loss. Although our country defeated the Philippines in the last battle, it ultimately failed to win the consecutive championship honor it had held for two sessions due to the record of only two wins and two losses on the score sheet. The great championship could only be given to others, which is a pity. After examining the organization of our country's team this time, it was selected and edited from the strong teams in Shanghai and Guangdong. The strength is unprecedented in our country's previous participation in the Far Eastern Games. However, before departure, a certain problem occurred regarding the selection. At that time, the five generals in Guangzhou expressed that they would not attend. Although Xu Minhui persuaded them and they made peace, the root of the disease had already been planted, and the signs of defeat began here.</p>
<p>Looking at the competition results, in the first round, the Philippine army won both matches, and our country had half wins and half losses. Japan lost both matches. Unexpectedly, the situation changed again in the second round. The Philippines first defeated Japan with three to zero, Japan then defeated China with three to one, and China then defeated the Philippines with three to two. The cycle of cause and effect has made the three countries stand on an equal footing. However, the reason why the Philippines was able to win this championship was entirely because it was able to establish a great achievement in the first round. Our misfortune was to suffer at the hands of Japan, which was a major fatal injury. Otherwise, our results would be equal to those of the Philippines (three wins and one loss). Who would get the championship? Another final would be required.</p>
<p>The reason for our country's defeat this time is all due to (lack of cooperation and lack of communication). Looking at the results of the second match between China and the Philippines, we can know more about the defeat of the Chinese army, which was entirely due to the failure to have sufficient preparation beforehand, which led to panic, chaos, and lack of discipline on the spot. By the last battle, when the original strength was restored, the fierce Philippines was defeated. What a pity it was too late, and the championship seat had already been taken by the Philippines. From this, we can believe that the organization of a team should first focus on communication, otherwise, even if each individual has exquisite skills, there is little chance that they will not be defeated.</p>
<h3 id="e273">Basketball Times News Reporter <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— Xia Kaiming</p>
<p>In the Far Eastern Games basketball game, the strength of the three teams from China, Japan, and the Philippines is equal. It was predicted beforehand that there would be fierce competition, and it was difficult to guess who would win the championship. We are known for our sharp forwards. Japan is good at defense, with courage on the spot. The Philippines' offense and defense are fast. Looking at the performance of the University of Santo Tomas team in Shanghai last year, its speed has been convincing. Its long-range throwing is also very sure. This year's delegation is still based on that team, supplemented by other elites. The experts all said that it is a strong enemy of our team.</p>
<p>First Match Between China and Japan On the 12th, our flag was raised to victory. With swift attacks, the Japanese team was flustered. Japanese coach Asano also said that our team's connection was miraculous, causing the Japanese players to be psychologically terrified and collapse. Between the lines, there was a sense of (admitting defeat). The first half was 18 to 7, and the result was 42 to 26. We finally washed away the shame of the last session.</p>
<p>First Match Between the Philippines and Japan In the match between Japan and the Philippines on the 13th, Japan worked hard to fight. Except for the fact that the first half was far behind with a score of 16 to 29, the second half was fierce in pursuit, with a score of 29 to 36. Unfortunately, they failed to cheer up in the end and were still defeated with a score of 35 to 51. The Philippines' rapid and accurate passing was fully revealed in this game.</p>
<p>First Match Between China and the Philippines The match was not finished on the 15th due to rain, and a dispute arose. We argued strongly based on the resolutions of the Basketball Committee. Justice was finally upheld, and the replay was on the 18th. Our formal players, Tang Bao et al., unexpectedly did not play at the beginning. Mu Zuoyun, Yu Jingxiao, Wang Yuzeng, Wang Xiliang, and Wang Zhanruo were the first five to deal with it, which was taken advantage of by the Philippines, which scored nine points in a row, and then became 13 to 5. Tang Bao and others joined the battle group, and the momentum gradually increased, but they were unable to rise above, from 9 to 21, and ended the first half with 13 to 23. They were still unable to do anything in the second half, and finally lost with a score of 27 to 37. It was a miscalculation not to have the formal players on the field at the beginning.</p>
<p>Second Match Between China and Japan Held on the 16th, the Japanese side's performance was excellent. We won by a narrow margin of one point with a score of 48 to 47. If Wang Yuzeng hadn't thrown the ball in at the end, we would have undoubtedly lost. At the beginning, our team was leading with 17 to 7, and the first half ended with 23 to 19. In the second half, the entire Japanese team gave their all, leaping from a 27 to 35 defeat to a 40 to 39 victory. In the end, we won by one point, which was extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>Second Match Between the Philippines and Japan The Japanese team's performance was amazing, and when they met the Philippines again on the 19th, they were even more spirited, causing the Philippines, which is good at fighting, to admit defeat and triumph with a score of 40 to 38. Japan led from beginning to end, with 20 to 18 in the first half and 20 to 20 in the afternoon. The Japanese players' fighting spirit is indeed commendable. 　 Second Match Between China and the Philippines After reviewing the past results, China and the Philippines have each lost once. Because of the indirect advantage created by Japan, we are unwilling to let it go easily. Therefore, the last battle on the 20th is the key to success or failure. The first half ended in a tie with a score of 20 to 20. In the second half, our formation was scattered, and we fell behind. As a result, we lost the basketball championship to the Philippines with a score of 44 to 33.</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>In front of this Phoenix Carriage, there was a short, small door. When the Empress Dowager was boarding the carriage, Li Lianying would first open it. The Empress Dowager would then step through the opening, slowly turning around to rest her back against the soft cushion behind her, her face facing forward, comfortably seated in this box-shaped mobile room. When ordinary people rode in sedan chairs, the carriers often unintentionally made their shoulders rise and fall, causing the person inside to be jostled and uncomfortable. However, those carrying the Phoenix Carriage would never dare to behave like this.</p>
<p>On both sides of the Empress Dowager's seat, there were armrests covered in yellow satin with silk floss, especially for her to rest her arms. Besides these armrests, right in front of her chest was that short door-like thing. There was also a narrow wooden board on it, generally covered in yellow satin, very soft and smooth. If the Empress Dowager wanted to lean forward, she could comfortably rest on this door, because its ends were fastened with iron buttons, so it would never shake.</p>
<p>This board, which could be leaned on, was about five or six inches wide and could be lifted up. To put it more clearly, under this board, though nominally the small door of the Phoenix Carriage, was actually a rectangular, flat box. Because it was made to be exactly the same width as the carriage, it served both purposes: a small door and a table for the Empress Dowager. The person who designed this was truly ingenious for that time! So, what was placed inside this rectangular, flat box? Of course, there were things inside! The first thing was the Empress Dowager's powder puff, and the second thing was a short jade ruler. However, this ruler was round, and the Empress Dowager often used it to rub her face, seemingly to reduce wrinkles. (39)</p>
<h3 id="e276">University Students' Worries <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— Only Via</p>
<p>University students naturally have plenty of money at home. As the saying goes, "With money, you can make the devil push the millstone." So, how can a university student with the economic means still have worries?</p>
<p>It is said that university students also have genuine worries. The first is not winning the favor of a queen or princess. Even though one is a handsome university student, for the sake of the queen or princess, one does not hesitate to condescend and curry favor. After spending three days and three nights drafting a flawless and concrete plan to attack the queen or princess, what is the result? The queen or princess, however, shows intimacy with another classmate, arm in arm or embracing. Losing both the lady and the army, how can a university student not be worried?</p>
<p>Second, the exam date is approaching. The famous bookworm in the class refuses to help. The professor is stern and refuses to narrow down the scope. With all roads blocked and no solution in sight, Heaven's help is not as good as man's help, and man's help is not as good as self-help. It is best to burn the midnight oil and prepare late into the night. But after looking at the second page, one forgets the first page. After looking at the third page, one simply looks at it without understanding anything. If one fails the exam and is held back, the old man at home will be angry and cut off the economic supply, which is not something to be taken lightly. This is naturally cause for worry.</p>
<p>After completing the course and looking around for a while, one graduates because of the virtue accumulated by one's ancestors. At this time, one has to worry about one's future after graduation. Should one study abroad? One knows oneself and knows one's illness, fearing there is no hope. Should one seek employment? One disdains small positions, and one's abilities are not sufficient for large positions. Heavens, how worrying!</p>

<p>— Maple Child</p>
<p>After the decline of the incense market in Hangzhou, the banks of West Lake have added a vibrant scenery since the Kalachakra initiation ceremony for the rebirth of the Panchen Lama. Some come from the sea to join the festivities, some come from Nanjing to pay their respects, and there are also local devout men and women and curious people who want to see the Tibetan living Buddha. The lonely Six Bridges and Three Temples, covered with fallen flowers, have regained the joy of spring in the flying dust.</p>
<p>Hearing that the Dharma assembly can promote world peace, then Buddhism can save the country. China, which is poor and weak, is far from the enemy of its strong neighbors in terms of military weapons. Instead of shouting empty slogans of armed resistance, it is better for everyone to close their doors and recite a chapter of the scriptures. Occasionally flipping through old newspapers, I saw a headline with a startling title: (The righteous act of overthrowing the puppet state failed, and the patriot Gao Chengzhang was arrested!) Needless to say, after cruel torture and interrogation, the patriot died for his country! I am reminded of Jiang Minsheng, an anti-Japanese hero, wandering on the sea and crying for food. It cannot be denied that their righteous actions, although they were willing to sacrifice their lives to save the country, cannot be severely blamed for their foolishness, but throwing eggs against stones is also not favored by the wise.</p>
<p>I think that although the purpose of saving the country is the same, the methods do not have to copy old articles. Everyone should do their best and take their own path. Why bother to imitate moths flying into the flame? To give an analogy: those who do business should try every means to seek profit, those who study should study their books diligently, and those who have free time may as well work hard to strengthen their bodies. And so on.</p>
<p>In short, success is easily achieved at the right time and in the right place (position). Otherwise, one will take a detour in vain and still be scolded as: (Fool!)</p>

<p>Chapter 29: Reply Letter Reveals Heartbreak, Vowing to Live Alone; Listening Together, Swearing Loyalty with Blood</p>
<p>After thinking for a while, Jiang said firmly, "There's no need to read the letter. Just tell me the gist of it." Gui Zhi said, "You understand my past. Although I know Gan Erye, it's only because he's a neighbor. I have nothing else with him." Jiang said, "We don't need to talk about the past. Let's just talk about the present." Gui Zhi said, "His letter mentions the past. If it weren't for my mother scolding the two of us and bringing up the past, people wouldn't know what I used to do." Jiang said, "What does the letter say about the past? Anyway, you didn't promise yourself to him." Gui Zhi said, "Humph! That's exactly what he's asking about. Look, isn't this joking with people? If the Zhao family finds out, I naturally won't be able to live as a human being. But you'll also let people talk about why you raised such a girl." Jiang said, "Alright, stop talking. It'll be over if you ignore him in the future." Gui Zhi said, "If it would be over if I ignored him, I wouldn't be talking so much nonsense." Jiang said, "If you ignore him, what can he do?" Gui Zhi said, "I'm not ignoring you because I think he wouldn't dare to do anything. It's just that if I don't cut off his thoughts, it'll seem like I acquiesced to him writing this letter. If this goes on, when will it end? So, I think that just ignoring him isn't a solution." Hearing this, Jiang couldn't help but open her eyes wide and look at Gui Zhi very attentively. After pondering for a long time, she asked, "According to your meaning, are you planning to write him a reply?" Gui Zhi said sternly, "Don't misunderstand things. Replying is just replying, but there are many ways to reply. For example, I can honestly say in the letter that he shouldn't do this, and if he writes again, I'll announce it. Tell me, would he still be embarrassed to write to me again if I said that? Anyway, we don't see each other, so it doesn't matter if I offend him." (389)</p>

<p>— Xie Jijue</p>
<p>Playing handball is a wonderful sport, and it's now sweeping the whole school! Perhaps it's also popular in other places?</p>
<p>A tennis ball, the kind used in plays, is thrown against the wall, and it bounces back. The second person has to catch it and throw it back. The performance continues in this way, and whoever can't catch it loses. The number of losses is used to compare who is better or worse. It's quite fun to play with a few people, and it's also considered a full-body workout. You use your hands, but you also have to aim with your eyes. At the same time, your feet have to run, your brain has to think, and your body has to twist and turn. So, no part of you is left unused. Moreover, this is not a sport that requires a lot of brute force, and it's especially welcomed by students who are not interested in sports.</p>
<p>At first, only a few people played on the outer wall of the dormitory. Gradually, everyone became interested, and more people played. As a result, one or two windowpanes on the wall had to be broken every day. As a result, the glass on the windows was reduced indefinitely. It was inconvenient to have windows without glass, and it was another loss to replace them. The dormitory manager (off-campus dormitory) was very worried, but there was no way to prohibit it. To cater to their preferences and avoid glass losses, he cleverly built a wall more than ten feet high in the open space behind the dormitory, coated it with cement, and drew red lines. This was much more suitable than an ordinary wall. As for the school, the physical education department has also commissioned the construction of a wooden sign for students who play handball.</p>
<p>Handball, it is said, is also a kind of ball sport. But in our school, this handball game was used by students who failed to return from the racquetball court to relieve boredom, and it gradually aroused the interest of the public. So, you often hear students saying, "Let's go play racquetball!" What is called (racquetball) here is (handball).</p>

Because the French lower house is located in the Palais Bourbon in Paris, since the previous parliament, mice have suddenly multiplied, and the valuable decorations in the palace have been damaged by mice. The members of parliament believed that it was necessary to keep cats, so they selected two fierce cats and kept them in the courtyard, and also named them candidate officials.</p>

<p>German astronomer Si Huaer De. Gelong Haer published a surprising theory. He said that this year is 1941, not 1934. According to his investigation, 1941 years ago (7 years before the Christian era), Saturn appeared in the Pisces constellation. At that time, there was a rumor among the Jewish people that when any changes occurred in the Pisces constellation in the east, they could break away from Roman rule, and the king of all nations on earth would surely be born from the Jewish people. For example, the birth of Christ was based on astrology and divination. The discovery of this extraordinary person's birth was Saturn, so it is judged that this year is 1941.</p>

<p>Recently, the French International Association published an article. It says that in the past 3,400 years, humans have been able to sleep peacefully for only 268 years. In the remaining 3,132 years, hundreds of millions of lives have been sacrificed in war. Although humans all yearn for lasting peace and advocate non-war, international treaties have been concluded more than 8,000 times, but after implementation, their effectiveness lasts for a maximum of two years. After two years, conflicts will occur. Therefore, the history of mankind can simply be called a history of struggle.</p>

<p>Yesterday, foreign banks were closed for the day due to the Whit Monday holiday, so only Chinese merchants heard news of remittances. Although Japanese merchants were not closed, investigations were hindered, so assessments were impossible and information was lacking. The foreign exchange rate in the market rose by four points in the morning and afternoon compared to the previous day, to seven points. The head discount still opened at two or three points, and the situation felt quite deserted. The turnover of short-term bills was over 4.1 million in the morning market, with over 300,000 in new transactions. The turnover in the afternoon market was over 200,000. The turnover in the small clearing house was over 300,000. Chinese banks received over 3.1 million in remittances, and over 3.9 million in various goods, foreign exchange, tax deposits, advance payments, and miscellaneous requests. The outflow was 300,000. There was no news from Japanese banks. Foreign exchange houses received over 38.8 million in foreign public funds, and over 4.7 million in foreign exchange head discount funds. Remittances from various routes were over 300,000, and cash receipts were 300,000 to 400,000. Foreign exchange deposit transactions withdrew over 400,000, and new deposits were over 700,000. Over 700,000 banknotes were recovered, and 600,000 were issued. Customer route sources were 200,000, and outflows were 250,000. In addition, the total amount of exchanges at the local bill exchange on the 21st was 8,500,009,777 yuan, one jiao, and four fen in silver dollars, including 3,751,574 yuan and seven jiao in silver dollars, and 4,758,202 yuan, four jiao, and four fen in foreign exchange and silver dollars.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the market of the Chinese Securities Exchange was indeed still sluggish, with only swap transactions. The fluctuations were stable and unchanged. Although there were occasional rumors about the current situation, most of them were speculation and had no relationship with the rise and fall of market prices. The current situation is brewing in a normal period, and the bond market is fluctuating in a normal period, which is interconnected and difficult to change. Therefore, large investors rarely enter and exit, and speculators dare not let go. They observe each other, and the market price becomes more and more sluggish. Moreover, the approaching settlement period does not cause infighting. If there is no change in the current situation, the future market price will not easily rise and fall greatly. Yesterday, numbers 38, 48, and 49 were sold in the morning. Both market prices showed signs of fatigue. The head discount was slightly lower by one or two jiao, while the 19th good was slightly better by five fen. The second discount was slightly lower by two or three jiao, while the 22nd pass was slightly better by one jiao. Both discounts slightly recovered in the afternoon. Retail investors slightly entered. The opening price was better by one or two jiao, and the closing price was better by five fen and one jiao. The trend gradually stagnated, and morale became more and more lax. If there is infighting between the two sides, it must also be limited. Yesterday's market price result was generally slightly lower by about five fen to one jiao. Only the long-term demobilization was lower by three jiao. The 19th good long-term was slightly better by five fen. The total transaction volume was 9.651 million yuan. The results of the price increase and decrease are compared in the table below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>New Kai Foreign Firm reported that the New York stock market was slightly higher and the closing was firm on the 19th. The transaction volume was the clearest in a year. This was because the European market was closed on Whit Monday, and speculators continued to wait and see, waiting for the more definite development of the two cases of silver and the exchange. Metal stocks were firm, and silver stocks were particularly strong, because the silver case will be submitted for discussion next Monday, and short sellers are replenishing their positions. According to the agent's report, (securities) speculators are waiting for news, and the rise and fall of the market is slight and unremarkable. (Wheat) The early condition has not been interrupted, and the official forecast for this week also shows no interruption. The situation is serious, and prices will rise. The weather forecast for northwestern Canada is rainless and slightly cooler. The Mengni forecast will rain. In the United States, rainy weather is limited to North Dakota, and the temperature is quite high. (Cotton) The market is light and mediocre. (Rubber) The market is light and mediocre. (Silver) The fluctuations are small, but the spot is continuing to be firm due to continued advances. The turnover in the half day was 250,000 shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left.</p>

<p>The yarn market is stable. Because the price of raw cotton has been rising recently, the cost of cotton yarn is very high, and factories are becoming more and more difficult. Therefore, the rumors of production reduction and work stoppage in the market are becoming more and more tense. Selling has subsided slightly, which has aroused some bullish sentiment, and the market has become more stable. However, if the price is too high, sellers will become active again. Therefore, the market atmosphere cannot escape the fluctuations.</p>

<p>At the opening of the previous bidding yarn market, due to the lack of managers and important sellers in the market, the near months rose by 1, 2, 3, and 5 jiao, and the far months were flat. In the afternoon, it was heard that spot yarn transactions were still good, and the near months rose by 2 and 3 jiao again, and the far months were flat. The total transaction volume for the whole day was 37,800 bales. It was found that Taixing sold 850 bales, Huikang 1,350 bales, Gengfeng 700 bales, Shenji 650 bales, Yichang 700 bales, Xinhua 500 bales, Changfeng 550 bales, Dafeng 500 bales, and Zhenda 500 bales. Senkang bought 950 bales, Suilong 800 bales, Jifeng 700 bales, Dafu 1,100 bales, Chunjie 750 bales, Yukang 1,150 bales, Dafeng 1,050 bales, and Yuantai 550 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>

The purchase amounts of each gang are as follows:</p>
<p>North Gang 25 | Guangdong 440 | Changsha 80 | Luzhou 65 | Shantou 30 | Inland 505 | Xiamen 20 | Ningbo 10 | Jiangxi 1 | Haizhou 22</p>

<p>The near-month cotton market is extremely tight, but the far-term bears are throwing out more positions, so the competition between the bulls and bears is fierce. However, spot cotton business is becoming more and more sluggish. Because yarn prices are not rising, it is difficult to buy high-priced raw materials. However, buyers still have no intention of releasing their positions. The future of the cotton market still has great waves.</p>

<p>At the opening of the previous bidding cotton market, Indian cotton was closed and American cotton rose slightly. The near-month situation in the market was quite strong. Tongji bought a lot, and Xincheng sold a lot. As a result, it fell by one jiao to one and a half jiao. In the afternoon, it rose by five fen to three jiao in the near month and fell by five fen to one jiao in the far month. The total transaction volume for the whole day was 139,900 dans.

<p>The Tianjin news reports that the Xihua cotton market in this city is calm. Buyers are all retail customers, and the market atmosphere has not yet escaped the calm. Rongdaxing bought 30 bales, with an opening price of 23 yuan, and another 36 bales with an opening price of 35 yuan. Defenghang bought 40 bales, with an opening price of 37 yuan, and another 40 bales with 40 yuan and 3 jiao.

<p>The market was very firm in the middle of last week due to the activity of buyers and the buying of Japanese merchants when prices fell. However, speculators are advancing and retreating based on export inquiries. Europe and China have little interest. The total transportation volume up to the 14th was 35,756 bales more than the same period last year, but the total inventory was only 250,000 bales more. The weekly statistics are appended below (unit: 1,000 bales).</p>

<h3 id="e299">Silk and Tea The Weather Suddenly Warms; Spring Silkworms' Sleep Period Varies <a href="#e299" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c299" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">299</a></h3>
<p>(Shangyu) This year, farmers in the Linxi Township and Henghe Town areas, seeing the lush mulberry leaves, all began raising spring silkworms. However, due to the decline of the rural economy and lack of funds to purchase seeds, the number of farmers incubating local varieties is not small. This spring, due to excessive rainfall and cold weather, the development of improved varieties has been slower. Fortunately, instructors have been doing their best to provide guidance, minimizing losses. Local silkworm varieties have weaker resistance and have suffered significant damage, with many farmers replenishing with late-spring silkworms. The timing of the silkworm season varies. Recently, with clear and warm weather, silkworm larvae have been developing healthily. Early batches have already entered their major sleep, while late batches are still in their third sleep. Leaf prices are low and lack a stable market value.</p>
<p>(Shengxian) In the various villages in southern and northern Shengxian, this year many farmers are raising self-retained local silkworm varieties. However, due to adverse weather, six or seven out of ten of the early batches were discarded. Therefore, they are all replenishing with improved varieties, with instructors paying attention to breeding and providing full scientific protection, resulting in fewer losses. However, the timing of silkworm sleep varies. Early batches have already entered their major sleep and are spinning leaves, while late batches are just starting their third sleep. In recent days, the weather has been sunny and warm, and silkworm larvae development has been progressing smoothly.</p>
<p>(Baima) The Baima and Xinfeng areas of He Prefecture have always been improved silkworm areas. This year, many are raising improved varieties. Mulberry leaf prices are low, and the number of larvae has surged. However, the number of farmers raising self-retained local silkworm varieties is also not small. Silkworm sleep is uneven, with sluggish development during the first sleep. Later, fortunately, the weather turned clear, with gentle breezes and warm sunshine, and silkworm larvae development has been very good. Currently, early silkworms are already in their third sleep and spinning leaves, while late silkworms are still in their second sleep. Leaf prices are only four or five dimes per load, with no market for leaf futures.</p>
<p>(Haimen) In recent years, silkworm farming in various villages has been declining. This year, due to the cold weather, mulberry trees sprouted later, and the silkworm season is also late. Larval growth is weak. Improved varieties account for five or six out of ten, and larvae collection has been delayed. After the first sleep, due to continuous rain, silkworm larvae development has been unhealthy. Instructors have been working to provide assistance, minimizing losses for improved varieties. Local silkworm varieties, due to their weak resistance, have mostly been lost. Recently, with clear and warm weather, both early and late silkworms have been developing smoothly. Early batches are starting their third sleep, while late batches are spinning leaves from the second sleep. There are few silkworms and plenty of leaves, with no stable market price.</p>
<h3 id="e300">Foreign Tea Firms' Tea Market Trading Is Quiet <a href="#e300" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c300" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">300</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, trading in the local foreign tea firms' tea market was quite quiet. This was because of the Westerners' horse races, with foreign firms only having half a day of trading. Furthermore, due to the fact that large shipments of Qimen new black tea had not yet arrived and new samples had not yet been released, and because of the sharp drop in Sui'an Zhenmei tea prices since last Saturday, most tea merchants were wary and sent telegrams to the interior to halt procurement of crude tea. Many local tea factories temporarily suspended production. As a result, very few new samples were released by various tea warehouses yesterday. Only firms such as Xie He and Yu Long purchased green tea, including Zhenmei, Zhenmei Needle, and Gongzhu, totaling over three hundred boxes, with prices continuing to decline.</p>
<h3 id="e301">Grains Futures Flour Gradually Rises <a href="#e301" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c301" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">301</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market for each month showed an initial flat and then rising trend. With foreign wheat prices up about thirty-five cents in Chicago and thirty cents in Canada, market sentiment was already stable at the opening. Subsequently, the Yingkou group aggressively purchased the current month, buying approximately sixty to seventy thousand bags from the opening to the close. Distant months also rose along with the momentum. As a result, the market for each month showed a gradual increase, up more than two cents from the closing price of the previous week. However, due to the good weather, many orders were also sold, otherwise the rise may have been even sharper. Approaching the afternoon opening, initial market sentiment was again uncertain. Although the current month was good at two dollars, in subsequent trading, because the Yingkou group's appetite had subsided, major factories gradually sold orders. It was heard that sales reached eighty to ninety thousand bags for the day, so the later market suddenly turned weak again. It was further heard that although flour exports from the local port are eligible for tax refunds, the three provinces are considering adding a tax of half a dime, a situation that has a significant impact on future flour exports. As a result, the current month rose by two cents, June rose by two cents, July rose by one cent, August rose by seven and a half li, September rose by five li, and October rose by one cent and two and a half li.</p>
<h3 id="e302">Stable Futures Wheat <a href="#e302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning and afternoon, the market for each month generally showed a stable trend. Although foreign wheat prices were up by various amounts around thirty to fifty cents, because of the clear weather and the interior group's thinking had eased, even local traders were not as excited about buying futures as they were the previous week. Therefore, trading in each session was generally stable, albeit slightly healthy. Given the current weather, if it can remain clear for a long time, this year's new wheat harvest will surely be abundant, and the market's ins and outs will also be predicted accordingly. As a result, June was good at two cents, August and September were good at one cent, and the rest were unchanged. The spot wheat market remains flat and soft, with Suizhou wheat opening at two dollars, nine dimes, and eight cents, Yaowan wheat at two dollars and nine dimes and a half, Yingzhou wheat at two dollars and nine dimes and two cents, and Guide wheat at [omitted] dollars, totaling three thousand bags, purchased by Fuxin.</p>
<h3 id="e303">Thick Geng Rice Falls Two or Three Dimes <a href="#e303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of goods for each group was similar to the previous day, with nearly twenty ships arriving with late rice, and more than thirty ships with thick Geng rice and various colors. Initially, sales were stagnant, but later, with sellers cutting prices, retail sales began to move slightly. The market trended downward, with the situation weakening. Until the close, market sentiment remained bleak, with no signs of improvement. The trend seemed even softer. Qingsi, Liantang, and other late rice saw activity from both the North and South Ocean groups on the surface, but in reality, only about a thousand bags were sold, with prices continuing to fall by more than two dimes. As for Su, Tong, Nangang, and other Geng rice, with thick inventories and a continuous influx of goods, and with the current economic downturn, the market was even worse, with prices falling by as much as two or three dimes. However, Chang group Geng rice, due to its scarcity, was only slightly affected by a few cents or dimes. Although only a small amount of Du Yangjian arrived, sales were too sluggish, and the market fell by more than a dime, with hidden changes also seeing a drop of two or three dimes.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, twenty-six or twenty-seven ships arrived from various routes along the river. Sales of various goods in the market were: Bai Geng rice was quiet, Bai Yuan rice was stagnant, Yang Du Bu Ke Jian rice saw little trading and lacked momentum, Bo rice trading was normal, and early rice saw few inquiries. Yin Yuan rice saw little trading, and the market showed Bai Geng, Bai Yuan, and early rice prices down slightly by about a dime, Yang Du Bu Ke Jian rice down nearly a dime, and Bo rice and Yin Yuan rice flat and weak.</p>

<p>Yesterday, hoarding purchases in this street stopped. Various groups from Shaoxing, Ningbo, and the interior also temporarily stopped due to many consecutive days of smooth sales, waiting for market prices to fall before resuming purchases. Furthermore, after the river rice prices fell by a small seven or eight dimes, market sentiment turned weak. However, due to the influx of goods from various sources after several days of soaring prices, nearly ten thousand bags of machine-processed Xian rice arrived from various ports by rail yesterday. Some cargo owners intended to sell quickly, so various grades of rough Xian rice uniformly fell by three to five cents and about a dime after the opening. However, after the market price stabilized, it triggered smooth sales from the [omitted] group. Yesterday, 6,150 bags of various rice were sold, including 100 bags of machine-processed red rice purchased by the Beiyang group, 250 bags of [omitted] rice purchased by this street, and the rest were purchased by the Fuzhou group. Furthermore, demand in Fujian province is very strong, and Zhejiang province is also experiencing a grain shortage. Although prices have fallen due to abundant arrivals, the market outlook is still positive.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the yellow soybean market was more stable than the previous weekend. This was because continuous telegrams indicated a rebound, and factories slightly responded. However, it was heard that warehouse stocks were about a hundred cars, so market sentiment was lacking momentum. Yesterday, it was reported that one car of Feihe soybeans was traded on this street, with prices opening at two dollars, nine dimes, two cents and nine dimes. Another car of Cai Zhengyangguan soybeans was purchased at a price of two dollars, nine dimes, four cents. Factories purchased two cars of Bengbu soybeans at a price of two dollars, seven dimes, five cents, one car of Yingzhou soybeans at a price of two dollars, eight dimes, five cents, three thousand bags of Guide soybeans at a price of two dollars, nine dimes, and over a thousand bags of Guide green soybeans at a price of two dollars, seven dimes, eight cents. Exports to Xiamen included Zhengyangguan soybean cars at a price of two dollars, nine dimes, six cents.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was flat and weak due to sluggish sales. The association's price fixed rough sand white sugar at twenty dollars, seven dimes, down by five cents, and those delivered at the dock at twenty dollars, seven dimes, eight cents. There was little change in number eight or nine Dutch red sugar, and trading was sparse. Taikoo Sugar's B mark called for twenty dollars, eight dimes, five cents, with the seller only willing to go to seven dimes, five cents without success, with the price likely to be at eight dimes. Zhenji's number one Ben Mianbai called for the original price and also lacked buyers. The tide of green sugar opened yesterday at over six hundred bags, with the highest priced at twelve dollars, followed by eleven dollars, nine dimes to eight dimes, five cents. Half southern green and western green sugar were at eleven dollars and a half. It was found that most of the market's inventory had already been taken into the hands of the sellers, with only a small portion of the goods in the market, and the land price was high, making it impossible to reconcile, so the trend is tight, and the market outlook still looks to continue to rise, but a stronger upward trend still awaits a turnaround in sales.</p>

<p>Jinshan branches, due to hopes of an abundant new harvest, firms have been selling off cheaply, and both sides have suffered losses. Fortunately, the inventory is not large, and there are no excessive losses. It has been found that market goods are gradually scarce, with over five hundred boxes being offered yesterday, a drop of another four or five yuan compared to the previous session. It is expected to stabilize temporarily after this, as it has reached a low level.</p>

<p>Sales of woolen fabrics are customarily quiet, but summer goods are still selling well, although much less so than in the spring, autumn, and winter seasons. Here are the trends for domestic factory goods, woolen fabrics, and various Western and Eastern imported woolen fabrics: Among domestic woolen fabrics, the best-selling items currently are elephant skin raincoat cloth, silk-gloss feather yarn, yellow twill, and flannel, with prices extremely strong. The source of this is entirely due to the New Life Movement. Among Eastern goods, white drill, white Zhigong, pearl raschel, and flower flannel are active. Among Western woolen fabrics, Palice valeting, feather yarn flannel white drill, white Zhigong, yarn twill, calico, and gum cloth are all selling very well. Other items are selling poorly and prices are weak, especially plain drill, flannel Palice, fat skin take three days also take French flannel, as their inventories are abundant and supply exceeds demand. Valeting feather yarn flannel are more resilient in the market.</p>

<h3 id="e309">Scientific Spirit Medium <a href="#e309" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c309" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">309</a></h3>
<p>— A Proverb</p>
<p>Religion and scholarship are weighed against each other; religion is valued more than scholarship, and scholarship is needed more urgently than religion. In reality, this is a highly disputable issue. We moderns have neither scholarship nor religion, so we probably won't have much interest in this issue.</p>
<p>We have superstition but no religion, and heresy but no science. However, modern science has advanced, Eastern culture is about to revive, and foreign devils are about to be driven back, and the evidence is (scientific spirit medium).</p>
<p>(Spirit medium) is a Chinese national treasure, and science is a Western essence. A national treasure plus a Western essence is suitable for men and women of all ages throughout the country. Westerners see it as a Chinese product, and Chinese see it as a Western product, satisfying both the psychology of the stubborn old guards and the feelings of the radical party. The inventor is of course a genius, and those who use it to promote fighting Japan or fighting Britain can also be said to have some insight.</p>
<p>The customs of the Song Dynasty were probably better than those of China today. In May of the fourth year of Shaoxing, Wang Juzheng, the scribe of daily life, said: "I have seen that in the prefectures and counties of Liangzhe, there is a custom of 'eating vegetables and serving demons'. Before Fang La, the laws were still lenient, and the custom of serving demons was not very prevalent; after Fang La, the laws became stricter, and the custom of serving demons became even more unstoppable... I have heard that those who serve demons have one or two cunning people in each village, called demon heads, who record the names of the villagers, swear an oath to form a party, do not eat meat,... The people are ignorant and say that if we follow the demons, food will be easier to obtain and things will be easier to achieve, so they believe in the demonic sayings and flock to them."... Of course, its badness can be imagined.</p>
<p>Lu You also had a memorandum discussing the like of evil Taoists: "Since ancient times, the rise of bandits has been due to droughts and famines, forced by cold and hunger, gathering together to attack and plunder. If there are appropriate measures, they can be appeased, and they will certainly not cause great concern to the court. Only evil and illusory people deceive good people in peacetime, form secret connections, and wait for the opportunity to act, then their harm is difficult to predict. I have seen that these people are everywhere. In Huainan, they are called "Two Hui Sons," in Liangzhe, they are called "Muni Sect," in Jiangdong, they are called "Four Fruits," in Jiangxi, they are called "Vajra Chan," and in Fujian, they are called "Ming Sect," "Jiedi Zhai," and so on. The names are different, and the Ming Sect is especially prevalent. Even scholars, officials, and soldiers have passed on and practiced it. Their god is called "Ming Envoy," and there are also meat Buddhas, bone Buddhas, blood Buddhas, etc. They wear white clothes and black hats, forming societies everywhere, distributing false scriptures and demonic images carved on woodblocks, using ancestral worship as "ghost summoning," permanently cutting off blood sacrifices, using drowning as holy water for bathing, and other demonic practices are difficult to enumerate. They are closely connected, like glue, and if they steal, it would be terrifying..."</p>
<p>As long as you pay a little attention to observing modern social customs and habits, you will know that the current situation is worse than this; what can be said of vagrants who have no food to eat and no education!</p>
<h3 id="e310">Scientific Spirit Medium <a href="#e310" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c310" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">310</a></h3>
<p>— A Slight Criticism</p>
<p>Chinese people admire superstition; at the same time, they like to talk about science with a dark lantern. Therefore, by adding the words "scientific" to the words "spirit medium," it can spread quickly and become popular for a while!</p>
<p>"Sincerity brings spirit," people who have played "spirit medium" generally say: "As long as you are sincere, you can invite any ghost or god, and you can ask about anything, and it is very effective." I have to believe this, and they will certainly not deceive me, but they have been deceived by the inventor of "scientific spirit medium."</p>
<p>Whether there are things like "ghosts and gods" in the world, as people generally imagine, I am ashamed to say that my knowledge is shallow and my experience is insufficient, making it difficult to know. But even if there are, I don't think a plate can invite them. Now, if there are tens of thousands of people, who simultaneously "trouble the plate fairy to invite someone to come and talk," if they can be invited, then the person being invited must have tens of millions of incarnations. Then the world would be full of ghosts and gods. If they cannot be invited, then it is that the "spirit medium" is not "spiritual."</p>
<p>The reason why "scientific spirit medium" is believed in by people is mostly due to curiosity, but also driven by a speculative mentality. Recently, various speculative businesses have been prevalent. The stock exchange can make people rich in a day, and an aviation lottery ticket is worth 500,000 yuan; and ghosts and gods are all-knowing and all-knowing. Just trouble the "plate fairy" to invite them, and with the labor of three people raising their hands and pressing their fingers, the stock exchange market and the first prize number can be predicted, wouldn't that be cheap. But if we think carefully, if the "spirit medium" is "spiritual," then everyone can speculate and make profits, and win the first prize. Do you believe that there will be such a thing in the world?</p>
<p>Science uses real evidence to explain things; saying yes is yes, and saying no is no. Moreover, it can be verified anytime and anywhere and will not be wrong. If it is said that the spirit medium has a scientific basis, then it should also be verifiable anytime and anywhere and will not be ineffective. But as mentioned above, can the spirit medium be effective everywhere?</p>
<p>Perhaps some people will say: How can the spirit medium be ineffective? If it is ineffective, how can the plate move? How can it find the words to answer people's questions? We can use scientific principles to explain this without resorting to ghosts and gods.</p>
<p>"Scientific spirit medium" is the same trick as the planchette that our boring literati play, and the invitation of Zigu that women play in their boudoirs. It is especially similar to the so-called "magic pendulum" of ancient Westerners. (There are many other similar tricks.) Everyone knows planchette, and sometimes it can write a few words on the sand table and make a few articles to answer people's questions. To invite Zigu, two people hold a rice sieve or a rice-washing basket, waiting for it to move on its own, and the number of times it moves can also be used to answer people's questions. A magic pendulum uses a string with a ring or a small ball hanging below. The other end of the string is held between two fingers, and the hand rests on the table to prevent it from shaking. After holding it like this for a while, the string can swing on its own and can also rotate. If a cup is placed next to the magic pendulum and the magic pendulum is asked "what time is it now," it will automatically strike the cup, striking as many times as the clock strikes. If the twenty-six letters of the alphabet are arranged around the magic pendulum and various questions are asked to the magic pendulum, the pendulum can point to each letter in turn, spelling out sentences to answer. This is the same as how the spirit medium's plate can point out the Chinese characters on the word board to answer. Chinese people will naturally say that ghosts and gods have descended, and ancient Westerners often borrowed from God.</p>
<p>In fact, according to the explanation in psychology today, this phenomenon is completely due to "automatic action". It turns out that no matter what thoughts we have in our hearts, we inevitably reveal them unconsciously in our bodies and express them as actions, which is called automatic action. The driving force is transmitted to the planchette stick, magic pendulum, or spirit medium plate, so that the stick, pendulum, or plate also starts to move on its own. And it often corresponds to the thoughts in the heart. Therefore, the reason why the planchette stick, magic pendulum, and spirit medium plate can move is still due to the automatic action of human hands. If it does not borrow from human hands, human thoughts cannot be conveyed, and the stick, pendulum, or plate will never move.</p>
<p>But perhaps some people will argue that the person holding the planchette, the person holding the pendulum, and the person pressing the plate have no thoughts in their minds when holding, holding, or pressing, and are even completely unconscious. Sometimes, when they want it to move, it doesn't move, and when it moves, they want it to stop, but it doesn't stop. It can be seen that this is definitely not stimulated by thoughts.</p>
<p>It should be known that human mental activity is divided into two types: conscious and unconscious. When thinking and acting, if one feels it, that is conscious thinking and acting. If there are thoughts and actions, but one does not feel them, then it is called unconscious thinking and acting. Usually, people's mental activity is conscious, so one is aware of every thought and action. But in addition to this conscious activity, there is also a kind of latent mental activity that does not openly manifest in peacetime, but can also think, perceive, and command the body, just like conscious activity. This mental activity is called subconsciousness in psychology. It does not communicate with conscious activity in peacetime and is completely unconscious. The reason why the person holding the planchette, the person holding the pendulum, and the person pressing the plate are unconscious of their movement is that they are being directed by the subconscious. The reason why they answer people's questions is also that the subconscious is thinking and answering there, so they cannot be conscious of it themselves.</p>
<p>The perception of the subconscious is sometimes very sharp. There are many things that the conscious cannot perceive, but the subconscious can perceive. It knows things that the conscious has never understood. There are many examples of this in psychology. This will not be repeated here. Sometimes the words obtained from planchette are higher than the conscious knowledge of the person holding the planchette; and the words on the "spirit medium" diagram that are not easily found by others are quickly pointed out by the person pressing the plate. This is the reason.</p>
<p>However, even if the subconscious activity is sensitive, it must still be based on past experience. When encountering things that have never been experienced in one's life, there is no way to answer. Even if one answers, it will not be accurate. Therefore, if one asks the person holding the planchette about their future situation, it is often inexplicable. At this time, they can only talk nonsense and deceive themselves and others.</p>
<p>If there are people who believe in "scientific spirit medium," please try to ask any future things and see how accurate they can be!</p>

<p>— Gao Bi</p>
<p>| Written in Memory of the Third Anniversary of the Death of My Old Friend Chen Xingshu |</p>
<p>(5) One summer, I and a teacher gathered a few like-minded "comrades" to organize a simple reading group - in name a reading group, but in reality it was for escaping the summer heat - using the empty rooms of a school during the summer vacation, and began our "cooperative study" life. Among the several "comrades," there was the suave and refined Sha Landa, the elegant poet Yu Taiyong, the comical and witty Ge Yulei, and the quick-witted and resourceful Chen Xingshu. This gathering was lively enough. Every day, in addition to the two hours of prescribed time, we followed our teacher's guidance and each read some thread-bound books in the room. The rest of the time was mostly spent sitting around and talking. A cup of fragrant tea, a few cigarettes, tasted extremely delicious, and in this way, we dispelled the harassment of the heat demon. The basic purpose of our conversations, although not conflicting, often led to good-natured disputes, and in these disputes, we gained some clever insights. Xingshu was regarded as the embodiment of intelligence. His tone was often extraordinary, whether it was a proposal or a defense, always carrying a leisurely charm that lingered endlessly. He also liked to provide novel additions after others had expounded their ideas, or to offer a turning point when everyone's words deviated from the point. With him, the spirit of our conversations would not be wasted; with him, our little conversation group would never fall into a state of exhaustion.</p>
<p>The school building was located right next to the city wall. We could walk to the top of the wall to take a stroll by using a springboard from the upper floor. Outside the city, there was a very wide river, winding and unfolding. Across the river, there was a teahouse with a waterside pavilion built along the river, which had a unique charm from a distance. Apart from a few scattered shops across the river, the surroundings were all the territory of grass and trees. We would go up to look out over the surroundings in the evening, and our hearts would suddenly open up. The stars adorned our heads, and we heard the croaking of frogs, the murmur of the river, and the rustling of the wind blowing through the grass and trees. The night was silent, and being in it, it was inevitable to cause unwarranted emotion. Xingshu, who was full of emotion, considered this a corner of the world beyond the mundane and often suggested going there.</p>
<p>One day, it was a moonlit night, and we were strolling on the city wall again. Under the silver shroud, everything was dyed with poetry, especially the slightly trembling ripples on the water surface, with the glittering reflections from the moonlight, increasing our aesthetic appreciation. Suddenly, Landa had a new discovery. He asked us to temporarily shrink the scattered gazes around us and direct them to the waterside pavilion across the river. We followed his words as if hypnotized. It turned out that there were several people sitting by the waterside window drinking something in the pavilion. Although we could not tell what kind of liquid they were drinking, we imagined that it should be intoxicating mellow wine. On such a moonlit evening, in such a waterside pavilion, quietly drinking together, what a touching thing of happiness that would be. What was unfolding before us was like a painting, and so each of us could not help but feel a deep sense of melancholy.</p>
<p>"Taiyong must have smelled the aroma of wine from across the river! I think he's blankly lost in thought. Rather than thinking that he was captivated by the entire painting, it would be better to say that the mere cup in front of him stirred up his longing." The mischievous Yulei glanced sideways at me, saying Taiyong, with the intention of waving five strings and watching the flying goose depart. It turned out that both I and Taiyong had a fondness for drinking. But when he said this, he not only intended to tease, but also to break the silence before our eyes. Xingshu finally came to add his opinion:</p>
<p>"Let's not neglect our own position. We, who are here with empty envy, may not be able to understand the true feelings of those who are actually enjoying it. If we were in their place, it would be the same. Reality is disappointing, and the line of imagination is a fulfilling harvest. The pleasure of the idea is just a kind of enticement, visible in front of you, but suddenly behind you, floating and elusive. No matter how you seek and pursue it, it will always maintain a considerable distance." Xingshu's words often contained philosophical components, and were not entirely a kind of self-deprecating language like "sour grapes."</p>

<p>That group of people still used meaningless words, sustaining the hunger of their souls; the children cried with stiff throats, curled up like corpses at the bottom of drained breasts. A fishy smell overflowed from the tavern, torches ignited in the eyes of the companions, everyone stared in bewilderment. Like prisoners sentenced to death hoping for (a savior). XXXX (Why doesn’t the relief center take them in? Have too many fleeing people come? What a disaster relief committee, the name is indeed pleasing, but, the hearts of the committee members are harder than stone and iron, we begged thousands of times, and couldn’t even grab a stinky penny or a handful of rice from them…) They quietly dispersed, and we could only quietly swallow tears in our hearts.

<p>— Zhang Yiping</p>
<p>Plum rain season. The gray sky, without a trace of rain, the weather is more terrifyingly muggy and hot than in June. A'gen from the Fuxing Tea Garden had just finished scrubbing the planks and was using an iron rod to stoke his coal stove. He was barefoot, his trouser legs rolled up to his calves, revealing rather sturdy calves, his upper body covered with a short jacket. He bent his legs, his eyes narrowed into slits, watching the flames in the coal stove. This was the most important task of his every morning, his food, lodging, wife, and children seemed to be rolling on these flames.</p>
<p>The water in the kettle was bubbling and hissing as if gasping for breath. A'gen sighed in relief, picked out the half-smoked cigarette butt from behind his ear, struck a match, and sat down on the stool, resting his muddy feet. A group of villagers carrying vegetables walked past the door, heading to the vegetable market. A'gen tossed away the cigarette butt, guessing that it was almost time for Grandpa Xu to arrive. There was a sound of clearing phlegm outside the door, it was indeed that tall Grandpa Xu. A'gen slapped the stool and jumped up, almost tripping over something under his feet. Muttering to himself, he loudly greeted Grandpa Xu.</p>
<p>The person called Grandpa Xu did not immediately respond. He wiped the sweat from his forehead with a handkerchief, carefully walked to his usual seat, placed the paper package in his hand on the corner of the table, bent down to tidy up his trouser leg ties, and when he raised his head, his nose and upper lip were twisted together.</p>
<p>"A'gen, what's that stinky smell?" he said loudly.</p>
<p>"Um, Grandpa Xu," the one who had just lifted the kettle quickly turned around. "Grandpa Xu, the sewer was clogged last night, and it hasn't been cleared yet today, that stinky smell…" He deliberately twisted his nose a few times, "(Once you get used to it, it's nothing…)" He didn't pay attention to the other party's reaction, and laughed to himself.</p>
<p>Then, silence.</p>
<p>Only then did A'gen boldly take the teapot and approach Grandpa Xu's table, pouring a full cup, quietly standing aside waiting for Grandpa Xu's words, which had not changed for years: "A'gen, go get three sesame cakes."</p>
<p>Not today, Grandpa Xu forgot, he must be hungry, A'gen couldn't help but say:</p>
<p>"Grandpa Xu, would you like some snacks?"</p>
<p>Grandpa Xu did not answer, it seemed that everything had changed today. He slowly raised the teacup, brought it to his lips, then stopped. After a long while, he suddenly turned his head towards A'gen.</p>
<p>"A'gen, do you know?"</p>
<p>Like a thunderbolt, the other person retreated three steps as if avoiding a slap, his copper-bell eyes wide open. A'gen didn't know anything.</p>
<p>"Zhu Xiaoquan is dead." His fist struck the table, probably because of the plum rain season, the sound wasn't crisp. "Heaven has no eyes!"</p>
<p>"Grandpa Zhu…" He jumped forward like lightning, tripping again, but A'gen didn't mutter, and also forgot his reason for being, sitting on Grandpa Xu's side. "Grandpa Zhu is dead?"</p>
<p>Grandpa Xu stared at the teacup, closed his mouth, and started playing coy. A'gen wanted to reach out and push Grandpa Xu a few times. "Which Grandpa Zhu?! Didn't he get two big silver dollars for the Dragon Boat Festival? Grandpa Zhu's death is like losing my wife and children…" Grandpa Xu finally spoke:</p>
<p>"A'gen, go get three sesame cakes!"</p>
<p>Disappointed, A'gen took the money. Two customers shouted in from the front: "Zhu Xiaoquan is dead!" A'gen felt like he had been sentenced to death: two dollars, two dollars, wishing him wealth and fortune on the first day of the New Year, hmph! It's all for nothing, heaven has no eyes! He forgot to call Grandpa Wang and Grandpa Wang Er inside to invite them in, and went out on his own.</p>

<h3 id="e314">Northeastern Compatriots Will Never Forget They Are Chinese <a href="#e314" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c314" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">314</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Not long ago, a certain important diplomatic figure expressed his opinion on the Northeast issue, saying a few words like this: "My opinion on the Northeast issue is that it is impossible to recover the four northeastern provinces by force, and it is also difficult to do so through diplomacy. Therefore, our main task now is to ensure that the people of the Northeast do not forget that they are Chinese, because the decline of national consciousness is the most terrible thing. If the people of the Northeast cannot retain their national consciousness, then over time, there will be no way…"</p>
<p>Our view is exactly the opposite. We believe that to save the Northeast, the most important thing is not to make the people of the Northeast not forget that they are Chinese, but to make the Chinese people not forget that the Northeastern compatriots are also Chinese. Why? The Northeastern compatriots have been trampled under the iron hooves of the Japanese for nearly three years, suffering the tragedy of losing their provinces and homes. Except for a very small number of people who are obsessed with power and profit, willing to be slaves and willing to be lackeys of the Japanese, the general public, since the September 18th Incident, how have they been longing for the motherland, how have they been hoping for the government to send troops to recover the lost land, how have they been organizing volunteer armies to fight against the Japanese? Is there still any need to worry that they will forget that they are Chinese? On the contrary, our compatriots inside the customs, seeing the fleshy dancers and movie stars every day, and their personal rights and happiness, may not have time to think about the Northeastern compatriots also being Chinese.</p>
<p>Look, the Northeastern compatriots have recently secretly sent a (Letter to the Elders of the Country). The letter recounts the pain of being in a conquered land, earnestly encouraging the motherland to strive and revitalize itself, to resist foreign aggression together, and to avoid following the same path as the Northeast. It also earnestly hopes that the motherland will unite from top to bottom and prepare in advance for the recovery of the lost land. The words are sad and the feelings are sincere, every word a tear, making it heartbreaking to read!</p>
<p>They also cite Italy, Russia, and Germany ten years ago as examples, hoping that the elders of the motherland (quickly prepare and secretly organize), as a (better late than never) plan. They believe that (if our elders can abandon the prejudices of individualism and temporarily adopt a unified attitude towards foreign countries, heaven helps those who help themselves, and victory will surely be achieved.) However, they (do not merely rely on the elders and willingly endure slavery).</p>
<p>Finally, they also say (Those of us who are forced by life to stay in the Northeast, or who serve in the so-called Manchukuo, should not all be regarded as traitors, because most of them still try their best to repay the Han people. This must be understood. Moreover, at the very least, the country should not regard them as sparrows to be driven away. Therefore, among the Northeastern people now living inside the customs, some are our fathers and brothers, some are our sons and younger brothers, wandering like lost dogs. Our country and the elders of North China should have pity and comfort them, and not despise and exclude them because they have lost their provinces and homes, making them feel attacked from both inside and outside. This is what we entrust to the elders of the country above all else.)</p>
<p>Alas! Hearing these sad words, what will the people of the country think? I really cannot bear to finish reading it!</p>

<p>— Xi Zhen</p>
<p>Night, the streets of a dead city. When the waiter from the coffee shop, having finished his work at the closed night market, took off his white coat and walked onto the street, carrying legs and eyes tired from work, he looked at the dead artery of the city.</p>
<p>The advertising lights at the entrance of the (Vienna Beauty Salon) were dark. Two dogs sniffed each other next to the closed iron gate. One dog suddenly pounced on the other; it barked, the sound floating sparsely across the street like the ringing of a bell.</p>
<p>Floating;</p>
<p>The patrolman with the hand lantern standing on the corner, the closed iron gates of the shops, the black display windows, the red alarm bell at the entrance of the pharmacy.</p>
<p>Looking and looking, angrily, dragging his heavy, exhausted legs, Luotinov thought again; (Has this world really died?)</p>
<p>A hot wind was blowing, and the five-kopeck worth of alcohol was taking effect in his brain: dragging his heavy, exhausted legs, and also dragging his heavy, exhausted eyes; (Nocturnal fantasy.)</p>
<p>(He remembered; Peter Keller's Spanish-style residence, the garden with Italian roses, the Sunday night banquet, his grandfather's military uniform with gold stars, his father's dashing gentlemanly demeanor, his own youth built on the heads of others, his young wife, hanging on the arms of American sailors every night, calling (darling), empty boxes of cotton wool and (Kotex), the strong smell of five-kopeck worth of alcohol, wearing the only pair of military trousers from the Czarist era, patched more than a dozen times, and three buttons missing.)</p>
<p>(The glory of the Czar!)</p>
<p>As the chemical reaction of the alcohol was taking place, he almost shouted it out loud; but no, looking at the patrolman's hand lantern on the corner, he suppressed the great outburst that had risen to his lips, what came out was a distorted tone;</p>
<p>(Damn, damn dog things.)</p>
<p>Dragging his legs, he walked to the tightly closed, pitch-black door of an (Apteka) (Russian for "pharmacy"), looked at the sleeping old watchman, looked at his fluffy white beard, pushed him awake, fixed his red eyes on his face, and spat out unclear noises; (Tell me, old man, where has the glory of the Czar gone? Where is our golden laughter? When will it come back? You tell me, you tell me!)</p>
<p>Shaking his fluffy white beard, spit splashing onto his face; (Get out of here, you wild dog! Who knows? Who knows? Aren't I the same as you?)</p>
<p>(Damn old dog! I'll beat you to death;) He clenched his fist with bulging veins, swung, missed, and then dragged his legs away. Astonished;</p>
<p>(Politeness? Gentleness? The elegance of saying (Yes, sir; that's right, very true)? The soft tone of saying (Farewell, miss), (Please help yourself, madam) to women?)</p>
<p>It's changed, everything has changed. Now they say; (Damn, killable dog things!)</p>
<p>But that's not right, didn't they often say (dog things) before too?</p>
<p>Leaning against the wall, he closed his heavy red eyes.</p>
<p>In the distance, he heard the large clock in the watch shop strike five times. Milk carts were passing on the street, bicycles delivering morning newspapers, and large trucks watering the streets. The patrolmen all went back to report for duty, carrying their hand lanterns; the ones who replaced them were all clusters of (Sigang) wearing steel vests, the buttons on their pistol pouches were open; the prisoner van drove out of the police station and roamed aimlessly around, the noisy areas, the deserted areas.</p>
<p>He suddenly remembered; (Tomorrow is May)</p>
<p>He heard people say: May is the season for plums</p>
<h3 id="e316">Plum Season <a href="#e316" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c316" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">316</a></h3>
<p>— You Qi</p>
<p>| Want some! Sugared plums, ten cents for one!</p>
<p>Round and green, lying in that bamboo basket, coated with a layer of white sugar syrup, the color grayish.</p>
<p>This voice, very bright, shouted from the street into this quiet alley. Whether it was that my nerves were a bit too sensitive, or my hearing was a bit off, when that loud voice floated past my ear, I always felt that it contained an element of sadness.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Yes, sadness always has some bitterness for the hearts of wanderers. Moreover, this wave of sadness, today two years ago, had a sad event that I cannot forget?</p>
<p>Indeed, time passes too quickly, this event, in the blink of an eye, is almost three years ago.</p>
<p>It is said that in the course of life, there are indispensable conditions, and love is the main one among these conditions. Because (women) are fascinating, regardless of whether the degree of (fascination) is high or low, and it is very obvious that men are willing to be fascinated. The reason, it is said, is that (women) are an indispensable life element in life.</p>
<p>However, who cares? How much sadness, decay, and even sacrifice has this life element caused!</p>
<p>Mano, is just another member who has embarked on the last journey in this abyss of ups and downs.</p>
<p>People, after all, are emotional animals. In times of ice and fire, they can be angry and hate, and in another turn, they can also be unrestrained and heroic.</p>
<p>If we compare it to Mano, then, the second item never existed between him and Xiu since they met. What could exist was only mutual unrestraint.</p>
<p>I remember that it was not long after they met, a late spring day, in Jiangnan, when the grass was growing: green sky, green grass, green suburbs, green treetops, in short, this was the season for young men and women to be intoxicated.</p>
<p>It seemed to be a Sunday? We walked together on the quiet Yuyuan Road. The road surface was strangely flat, and the houses were so magnificent! Walking, walking, underfoot, although there were no leather shoes, the rhythm was very harmonious. The warm wind blew on people's faces, kissing away a trace of lighthearted smile.</p>
<p>Walking into Zhaofeng Park, I couldn't help but feel a little lost. Look, in that green lawn, under that umbrella-shaped cypress tree, beside that mountain stone stream, on that secluded walkway, isn't it? Pairs of couples were walking very slowly, talking, the tone so gentle! Although there were obvious differences in race, there was no difference in mood. Occasionally, I glanced at Mano, who said that he didn't have the same happiness as them!</p>
<p>Perhaps, the mood of a wanderer is always lonely and bitter. At that time, I instinctively felt a component of sadness. I couldn't say why, but there was absolutely no jealousy in it. I don't know why, I always fantasized, I always thought that the mood in front of me would not last long, at most, it would only be like a cloud of smoke, in the blink of an eye, it would run away.</p>
<p>In the autumn of that year, they traveled to Hangzhou together. What happened after that, I never received a letter from them.</p>
<p>丨丨Perhaps they have already cohabited? Maybe they have already broken up! Who can be sure, but a letter should have come? In idle moments, I often think like this.</p>
<p>Friends, when they are together, they gradually become closer, and after they leave, they will slowly fade away.</p>
<p>Here, the shadows of Mano and Xiu were forgotten in my memory.</p>
<p>The harsh winter unknowingly slipped past, and when the swallows flew to Jiangnan, they brought such a message:</p>
<p>………After Mano and Xiu returned, although they struggled hard and wanted to fulfill their wishes, they were eventually forced by their parents more and more urgently, and they had no economic ability to be independent. Therefore, they jointly committed suicide by taking poison a few days ago, leaving a suicide note, and their relatives and friends were all weeping………</p>
<p>After reading it, I didn't feel particularly sad, only that loneliness and sadness had added a thicker layer of sadness.</p>
<p>This time, my wandering soul wandered back from outside again. I don't know what gust of wind directed me to step on the quiet Yuyuan Road again. Ah, everything is still the same, but where is Mano? Where is Xiu? Where is the harmonious rhythm underfoot? They will never be seen again.</p>
<p>With great difficulty, I walked to a street corner, a boy was carrying a bamboo basket and shouting 丨丨Want some, sugared plums, ten cents for one!</p>
<p>When the sharp voice floated past my ear, a burst of sadness rushed into my heart!</p>
<h3 id="e317">Xie San <a href="#e317" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c317" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">317</a></h3>
<p>— Bu Wei</p>
<p>Speaking of Xie San, people immediately think of a tenant farmer in his sixties, with a bent back and a protruding belly, and a face that always looked very sad.</p>
<p>Every time the east turned white, he was already up, without even washing his face, walking to the employer's house to do odd jobs. For the price of five cents, he had to shed sweat and blood all day, from dawn to dusk.</p>
<p>The fields that he cultivated himself were all planted at night after he finished his odd jobs, always working past midnight every night.</p>
<p>Years of drought, the fields were cracked by the sun. Every farmer wore a mourning face, and the old farmer Xie San was naturally one of them, because he was also one of the tenant farmers.</p>
<p>The hot June passed, followed by the arrival of the cool autumn, which was the time for the landlords to collect rent. At Xie San's house, Wang Er Ye (his landlord) also sent his accountant to urge the rent.</p>
<p>Xie San said many good things to Mr. Li (Wang Er Ye's accountant), giving all the twenty-odd stone of grain in his home to Wang Er Ye, and promising to pay Wang Er Ye's rent with the money he earned from doing odd jobs by the New Year, only then did he get Mr. Li's permission and was not arrested and sent to prison by the police.</p>
<p>Xie San's family now had nothing to eat! They were often seen eating vegetables as a meal, and when the vegetables were finished, they ate grass; when the grass was finished, they ate tree roots; although they lived like this, his family did not starve to death after all.</p>
<p>The harsh winter returned to the world again, and Xie San was now beginning to collect his wages.</p>
<p>At night, Xie San looked at the wages he had collected 丨copper coins and silver dollars, stunned, unable to hold back two lines of hot tears, which burst out of his eyes: The few coins he had earned with blood and sweat for a year were about to be transferred to Wang Er Ye's hands again.</p>
<p>Since the great drought that year, there had been several years of great harvests: although the grain prices were very low, having such a good harvest, he could still sell some for money. Xie San's family did not have to worry about not having anything to eat; a trace of a smile appeared on Xie San's face for the first time.</p>
<p>After years of living like a cow or a horse, he now actually had more than one hundred yuan in savings, which he and his son had accumulated from doing odd jobs and selling grain.</p>
<p>Bandits were spreading everywhere! In order to avoid bandits interfering with his fields, Wang Er Ye sold his land cheaply.</p>
<p>The hope was burning in Xie San's mind; At night, Xie San tossed and turned, thinking, and finally decided to buy Wang Er Ye's fields; this was truly a world turned upside down, a tenant farmer buying the landlord's fields!</p>
<p>After eating lunch, Xie San put on his only half-new blue cotton cloth gown, double-nose carp shoes, coarse cloth white socks, and happily walked to Wang Er Ye's house to buy Wang Er Ye's fields.</p>
<p>Wang Er Ye now decided to sell the seventeen mu of fields on the side of the road to Xie San, and at a price of five yuan per mu. Xie San was transformed from a tenant farmer into a half-self-cultivating farmer. How happy he was!</p>
<p>The army came to the countryside to (suppress bandits)! In order to facilitate (bandit suppression) and the transportation of guns and ammunition, the long-distance bus route was under construction.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the location of Xie San's field was right on the path that the bus had to take, and therefore it was leveled.</p>
<p>The unfortunate news immediately spread throughout the village! (Luckily I sold that field to Xie San, otherwise I would have been really unlucky!) A smug sneer flashed across Wang Er Ye's face.</p>

<h3 id="e319">A Ray of White Light <a href="#e319" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c319" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">319</a></h3>
<p>— Ma Ying</p>
<p>A friend from Hangzhou reported to me: (During the Shambala Mandala Dharma Assembly photography, the magnesium flash suddenly exploded, a ray of white light, running like a flying rainbow, the Living Buddha was actually frightened and stepped down from his seat.) Having already become a Buddha, he still fears white light like a tiger, not only changing color, but actually stepping down from the altar, is this not strange beyond strange. So after hearing this news, I was puzzled all day, thinking until my brain swelled, and then I suddenly realized.</p>
<p>The Shambala Mandala Assembly is held, firstly, to pray for peace, and secondly, to recommend the deceased and prolong life. If the world were truly peaceful through prayer, then the demon of war would abandon his armor and weapons and flee, and heroes would have no place to use their strength. If the general wandering souls were able to ascend to heaven and be reincarnated through transcendence, then King Yama would definitely have to reduce a sum of income. Therefore, the Living Buddha knew that by doing this Dharma service, although he could bestow grace upon countless sentient beings, he would also incur resentment from several villains. If there were grievances, they would surely be repaid, and if there were grudges, they would surely be avenged. The Living Buddha knew that they would not be willing to give up, so he was constantly on guard.</p>
<p>Sure enough, on the day of the photography, a white light flew over. The Living Buddha suddenly remembered the sword immortals and swordsmen in the old novels, whose killing weapon was white light; perhaps this white light was the flying knife or flying sword released by the assassins hired by his enemies. Because the Living Buddha was alive, he was not yet able to hide or escape, or even point his finger and spit out a lotus flower of five colors to block the path of the white light, so he could only run away to avoid it.</p>
<p>However, after being frightened, the Living Buddha did not change his original intention and continued to use his magical powers to continue praying, showing the Living Buddha's indomitable spirit. In the future, the world will be peaceful and the population will increase, all thanks to the Living Buddha. After the common people have benefited and the deceased souls have kowtowed in gratitude, everyone should put their palms together and respectfully express their thanks, saying: (Suddenly, a white light, running like a flying rainbow. The Living Buddha paled and fled in fear. Thanks to the blessing of Heaven, the white light was extinguished. The little devils in hell, all ascended to heaven; the human world is at peace, the country is prosperous and the people are safe. The Buddha's grace is spread in all directions! The Buddha's virtue is as high as the sky and as long as the water!</p>
<h3 id="e320">Eating and Love <a href="#e320" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c320" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">320</a></h3>
<p>— A Skinny Person</p>
<p>Which is more important, unemployment or heartbreak? This question has been debated before. Ultimately, is eating more crucial, or is love? This is a very interesting question. In my opinion, eating and love should not be separated. That is to say, this question should not be viewed as two separate issues. Rather, these two issues should be discussed together.</p>
<p>Eating and love may seem like two different things, but in reality, they are one and the same: "life." Life includes eating, and at the same time, it also includes love. Therefore, the conclusion should be: "If you have food to eat, you have love to pursue." Eating and love are forever linked together. If you have food to eat, you have love to pursue; conversely, if you have no love to pursue, you will inevitably have no food to eat. This is the unity of eating and love in life. Needless to say in ancient societies, but especially in modern society, this theory is proven to be correct. Because in a society dominated by money and power, everything becomes a commodity, and people also become commodities, especially women, who are the most commodified of commodities. In this commodity society, as long as you have money, anyone can buy anyone else. Women, in particular, have become objects of trade in the market. In this way, love is combined with eating and cannot be separated. Whoever can afford to eat can afford a woman—that is, whoever can obtain love. The greater the ability to buy food, the greater the ability to buy women—that is, the easier it is to find love. Conversely, those who have no food to eat cannot buy women—that is, they cannot find love at all. In fact, love and eating have become one and the same. The conclusion derived from the fact that love and eating are one and the same is that there is no distinction between the importance of unemployment and heartbreak. Unemployment means having no money to buy food, while heartbreak means having no money to buy a woman. They seem like two different things, but they are actually the same problem. As long as you have money, you can buy both at the same time. The core of the problem is not about unemployment or heartbreak, but about having money or not having money. With money, all problems can be solved; without money, everything becomes a problem. This is the core of modern society. The core of modern society is money. Money dominates all of humanity and determines all social problems. In modern society, unemployment and heartbreak are merely various secondary phenomena derived from this central problem. Disregarding the central problem and seeking solutions solely from these secondary problems will not yield any answers. Then, why is money the central problem that dominates everything in modern society? This is because in modern society, money is separated from the masses. Wealth is originally meant to be shared by all of humanity, but now a portion of people have locked up this wealth, creating a vast distance between the majority of people and wealth. This is how money is able to dominate all of human life. Money dominates humanity, and as a result, humanity cannot dominate wealth and is, in fact, enslaved by wealth. Because people are slaves to wealth, all problems cannot be solved without money. Money replaces the central position of all problems. To achieve satisfactory solutions to all problems, we must first reverse the social order in which people are dominated by money and transform it into a social order in which money is dominated by people. This is the central point of solving the problem.</p>

<h3 id="e321">Scientific Spirit Writing <a href="#e321" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c321" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">321</a></h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>Recently, a type of "Scientific Spirit Writing Chart" has become popular in the market. It was invented by Bai Tongjun, a Chinese student who studied in Germany, and sells for one and a half dollars. It is widely purchased, and almost every student, large or small, and every family has one. I also bought one and studied it carefully. I also feel that it is very accurate. It can summon Sun Yat-sen and others. I wonder if it is a psychological effect or if there is a scientific basis? Now, some ignorant women are using it to ask about lottery numbers and gambling tickets. As soon as they ask for what number will be drawn, they use a lot of money to bet on it. If they lose, some even want to die. This is an important social problem. Please gather experts to study it together and provide a detailed response. I wish you good health. Sincerely, Li Taosheng, a reader.</p>
<p>Answer: The editor has recently seen these so-called "Scientific Spirit Writing Charts" hung on stalls by the roadside when traveling on the main roads. I am very familiar with these kinds of "spirit writing" things, so even though it bears the name "scientific," it does not arouse my curiosity enough to take a look at it. After receiving your letter, to learn its content, I bought one to see what it was all about. After looking at it, I couldn't help but laugh. This thing is indeed more advanced than the old-fashioned planchette writing, and its methods of deception are also more clever. In fact, this kind of spirit writing has no profound or mysterious principles at all. We can expose the true face of this "Ouija board" with just common sense. Three people use their middle fingers to press on the bottom of the planchette. After several tens of minutes, wouldn't your hands be numb and sore? Once your hands are numb, they will inevitably tremble involuntarily, so you will feel that the "spirit" has truly summoned a "ghost" (?) for you. Moreover, when three fingers are placed on the planchette, the force cannot be evenly distributed. If one person applies slightly more force, the planchette will inevitably move. The other two people, seeing the planchette move, will inevitably follow its movement, but if they follow its movement without applying any pushing force in the direction of the planchette's movement, their fingers will lift off the planchette. Therefore, the other two people will then involuntarily push the planchette. After that, the ratio of the force applied by the three people will become even more uneven, and the planchette's path will naturally become even more irregular, spinning around and around. This is the origin of the "spirit summoning someone to come and talk."</p>
<p>As for its accuracy, it can be accurate to the extreme. If you ask who is coming, you must already have an answer in your mind and you must be looking for the letters of the visitor's name on the chart. In this way, even if you don't intentionally push it, because of what you see with your eyes, you will inevitably and naturally make the "planchette" find it for you. I remember when I was learning to ride a bicycle as a child, I saw a small car parked nearby and wanted to avoid it, but I still ended up hitting the small car and falling over. This is possible when your hand is sore and trembling. Moreover, there are many Chinese characters with the same sound but different meanings, making it even easier to force an association. I think, apart from these two factors and intentionally assisting the "spirit," there is absolutely no other reason for its "accuracy." If it is not "accurate," if the answer is not what you asked, or if the answer is unintelligible, then you will inevitably blame it on the insincerity of yourself or the other two people, because only sincerity brings accuracy. Insincerity, of course, cannot bring accuracy. In other words, spirit writing is still about being "accurate" with sincerity. I'm afraid it's very difficult to achieve "sincerity." If the "spirit" has the slightest doubt, it's insincere; if you have any distracting thoughts, it's insincere; if you don't pray hard enough to the person being summoned, it's insincere... and so on. There will never be a time of "sincerity." The so-called mystery of "scientific spirit writing" lies in this. But I say it is more advanced than the old-fashioned planchette writing for a reason. The old-fashioned one requires writing out the "characters." It won't be accurate unless you cheat, but this one doesn't need to. The old-fashioned one requires two people to stand opposite each other and hold the planchette stick, making it easy to balance the force. If one side doesn't intentionally apply force, it is difficult to move it, while this one only requires pressing the bottom of the planchette with your fingers, making it easier for your hands to become sore and for it to move. So the components of "accuracy" are much greater than in the old-fashioned one. As for what you said about ignorant women using it to ask about gambling, that's not surprising at all. This kind of spirit writing is produced because of the development of gambling and speculative psychology in society. No matter which superstitious person, they rarely have their fortune told when they are successful. But when they are unsuccessful, they ask for fortune sticks and calculate the hexagrams every day. This is a certain pattern. In this year of economic panic and increased unemployment, it is very difficult to get rich except through gambling. So the rich gamble on government bonds, and the poor gamble on flower associations. The only way to get rich is to gamble. Gambling is completely dependent on so-called "fate" and "chance," which cannot be controlled by people's consciousness. The winning number of the aviation lottery can only be known by heaven before it is drawn. Ghosts and gods can tell you. Therefore, so-called scientific spirit writing can be the only guide for gamblers. You can see that there are fewer scientific spirit writing charts on the market now. The reason is that the aviation lottery has already been drawn, the winning number has already been shaken out, and there is no need to ask the "spirit" anymore. So, it's not surprising that these practices of seeking gods and asking for divination are so popular. This is precisely the psychological manifestation of most people being filled with "finding no possible way out but having to rely on fate." If people can know the proper ways to make a living, this kind of trick will inevitably disappear. Conversely, even if scientific spirit writing charts are defeated, similar kinds of spirit writing things will continue to emerge endlessly. And therefore, our only way to defeat seeking gods and asking for divination is to make people realize the direction they should strive in, and to have a firm belief in this direction. — Editor</p>

<p>— Zhang Yiping</p>
<p>Friday, March 30th. A calendar with chromium numerals lay on the manager's oiled desk. Two young debt collectors, city-slickers, held their Stetson hats in their hands, presenting four Chinese bank checks for 1,500 yuan, due the next day.</p>
<p>The manager of the World Trading Company, a handsome man with Chaplin hair, Cowlman eyes, a Hepplewhite nose and mouth, was a narcissistic dandy. Raising his exquisite fingers, he removed the cigar from his lips, flicked off the ashes, casually pulled over a hardcover ledger, filled in four entries of 1,500 yuan, and slightly nodded his head, as if wary of his Chaplin hair falling down. The young debt collectors retreated to their positions.</p>
<p>As the clock struck five, the office boy handed over a letter from the Yangtse Hotel just as he was pulling out the safe key from his beige suit.</p>
<p>Cowlman's eyes fixed on the handwriting on the envelope. He frowned as if lost in thought, and awkwardly tore open the envelope.</p>
<p>Minson:</p>
<p>We arrived in Shanghai today, staying at room 356 of the Yangtse Hotel. Please come for a chat at your earliest convenience, and also to meet my new wife.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely, Junyang. Today</p>
<p>A Hepplewhite-like smile appeared. Before his eyes seemed to float the image of Junyang: "I'm heartbroken... I want revenge! A beautiful girl is waiting for me in Peiping, Minson, goodbye! I'm alone, never stepping onto Shanghai's Bund again?" He waved his hand, looking pitiful. Three years, without a single word. And now he brings back a new wife, a beautiful girl from Peiping.</p>
<p>Thinking, he snatched the check key and stuffed it into his pocket, swiftly turning to leave the World Trading Company's glass doors. The elevator, as if waiting just for him, descended from the fifth floor and he tumbled into the car parked in front of the door.</p>
<p>... Piled-up hair, a loud red tie, waving his hands, sitting in the coffee shop smoking cigars every day, Junyang, a man who knows nothing of women, needs a woman. That Saturday night in spring: "Who would love a man like you!" Sending him off on the boat to Peiping...</p>
<p>He could not continue to think. The chauffeur opened the door, waiting for him to alight. Smoothing the wrinkles on his knees, he ordered the car to return.</p>
<p>He energetically mounted the stone steps. In the elevator, he raised his exquisite fingers to smooth his Chaplin hair, and gently knocked on the door of room 356.</p>
<p>... Minson, am I heartbroken? He had expected that sentimental voice.</p>
<p>"Is this Mr. Wang? Please come in." Pure Peiping accent. A beautiful wife greeted him at the door.</p>
<p>"Is Mr. Junyang in?" He removed his hat and inquired with gentlemanly courtesy.</p>
<p>"He just went out. He'll be back shortly. Please come in." A Peiping smile. The Peiping girl has fallen in love with Junyang. He strode in, as proud as if entering an office.</p>
<p>The Peiping wife offered cigarettes and tea. They sat down facing each other.</p>

<h3 id="e323">The Boldness of American Producers <a href="#e323" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c323" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">323</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Fu</p>
<p>Written after viewing "Film: Nana"</p>
<p>An ancient philosopher, when discussing Apollo, said: "Apollo is a god of music, but also a god of archery. I love his songs, but I fear his arrows!" After watching "Film: Nana," the first impression that comes to mind is such a bittersweet association.</p>
<p>If you want to see some aspects of French society during the Third Republic in "Film: Nana," or observe the overlapping life of the actress Nana, as described by the naturalist writer Émile Zola, then your hopes are in vain. Furthermore, if you want to see some of the exposure of the corruption of the aristocratic bourgeoisie or the criticism of social injustice at the time by this writer with a strong sense of justice, then your expectations will be denied. "Film: Nana" and "Novel: Nana" have no blood or hereditary relationship. The original work is merely a suggestion for the film. Samuel Goldwyn, the American film producer, with typical American boldness and disregard for others, unceremoniously seized the "songs" he liked from the works of the French naturalist writer and avoided the "arrows" he feared!</p>
<p>In the words of Georg Brandes, a great critic of Zola's time, "Zola is... a thinker who cannot unlock the profound secrets of the age, an incomplete poet under the standards of aesthetics, but in his talent and dedication, in his fairness and courage, he is fully entitled to be a warrior alongside Taine, Renan, Rousseau, and Voltaire!" In his works, he mercilessly described the ruling class of the time, lashed out at the greed and reaction of the urban and rural merchant classes, exposed the deception and crimes of stockbrokers and religious figures, and further explored the connection between phenomena and causes, pointing to the impending revolution. In Goldwyn's eyes, these were undoubtedly terrifying "arrows," sharp "arrows."</p>
<p>However, on the one hand, Zola was a popular follower of the Lombroso school of determinism. He could not unlock the profound secrets of the age or obtain a necessary vision for the transformation of social organization from his frantically exploring scientific method. He merely borrowed the principles of heredity and environment, which scientists at the time were passionately discussing, and used his astonishingly sincere and meticulous technique to depict all the morbid phenomena of society at that time: splendor, luxury, licentiousness, and morbid beauty. This is the "song" of the naturalist poet, a "song" that can please the well-versed citizens of the fin de siècle and film producers.</p>
<p>Adopting these derivative descriptions and plagiarizing the evocative name "Nana," what emerged under the massive production costs and advertising expenses was a film of "Nana" that washed away all the spicy and filthy "Zolaesque" elements and added some intense "Dumas-esque" sorrow and sentimentality! Indeed, this is an era of war and revolution. The licentious and decadent "Nana" of the 1870s could become a nationalist warrior in the 1940s, listening to the cries of "To Berlin!" outside the window and shouting the slogan "France needs you!" at the moment of death! Is this the work of Zola, famous for the Dreyfus Affair? This is already something "beyond a wry smile."</p>
<p>Apart from Anna Sten's outstanding acting, what can be admired is Samuel Goldwyn's characteristically American bold, audacious production policy and Willard Mack's courageous adaptation.</p>

<h3 id="e324">Blood Under the Chastity Arch <a href="#e324" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c324" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">324</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Weng</p>
<p>Thoughts after watching "A Good Night"</p>
<p>In this era of transition between old and new, whether a woman who has lost her husband should keep her chastity for him has become a very serious issue. This film, "A Good Night," is produced in the study of this issue. At the beginning of the film, the reel is marked with a few subtitles that say: "There are three things that are plentiful in Bai Village: cypress trees, memorial arches, and widows..." Although it is only a few simple words, it has fully expressed the unbreakable old habits of China for thousands of years, and the main theme of the film is revealed in one sentence.</p>
<p>The central consciousness of this film is undoubtedly to criticize the hypocrisy of chastity. The protagonist of the film is a young woman who yearns for the comfort of love. Unfortunately, her husband dies, and she is asked to live alone. After all, she is not a living dead person and cannot forget the instinct of desire. However, because she is in awe of the power of ethics, she does not dare to restrain herself. When she is silently facing her lover in the countryside, she almost loses control because of the impulse of desire, but the phantoms of the chastity arches suddenly appear in her mind, one after another. She can only wail and run away.</p>
<p>In addition to this, it also describes: the clan chief having secret affairs with married women, but verbally pretending to be benevolent and righteous; the petty tyrant defrauding the weak, and interfering with the freedom of widows because he cannot satisfy his own sexual desires; the old chaste mother is crushed to death under the chastity arch, only to be cursed that she is suffering the consequences of her own actions. All these expose the strange phenomena in remote rural areas, and it can be said to be a thorough exposure.</p>
<h3 id="e325">After Watching "A Good Night" <a href="#e325" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c325" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">325</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Chen</p>
<p>In China's century-old feudal society, chastity was regarded as the supreme virtue of women. Under the decaying and majestic chastity arches were buried countless young widows' blood and souls.</p>
<p>The entire consciousness of "A Good Night" is commendable. It uses the spiritual impulses of a young widow and the difficult-to-resolve conflict with old concepts as a backdrop, not only satirizing the hypocrites of false morality, but also boldly exposing the absurdity and cruelty of the old ethics. When the young widow, Yunlin, is pointed at by the crowd and hit with snow, and when Yunlin's mother-in-law unreservedly retorts that these clan chiefs and people are all bullying the weak widows by relying on their power, this climax is very successful and powerfully arouses the audience's anger and sympathy. Therefore, the consciousness of "A Good Night" is very suitable for women in the current transition period, especially female students.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, it generally lacks transitions, so the entire tone is static, but when recalling the psychological description of the widow, one feels its value.</p>
<p>In terms of the story, there seem to be some unreal aspects. According to the old Chinese customs, there is very little punishment for unchaste men, because there is fundamentally no custom of judging men's unchastity. In "A Good Night," there is actually an incident of expelling the twenty-fourth generation descendant. I wonder if there is such a thing?</p>
<p>In terms of technique, I am very satisfied. Yunlin uses well water to look at her face, and her feet move upon hearing the sound of the zither, which systematically expresses the emotions of a young widow. When Yunlin is drying clothes, the memorial arch is moving in her heart. When she is undergoing the "Last Judgment," she is pointed at by the crowd. Snow footprints (imitating "Beauties Taming Tigers"), the clan chief's close-up of his angry face (imitating "Crossroads"), two shadows during the secret meeting, Yunlin hiding behind the tree to see them off, etc., all have unprecedented and beautiful success. Using peach trees as a background adds even more sadness.</p>
<p>Actress Tan Ying is the best. Her movements and expressions are mostly in the slow Western style. But she lacks eye expressions. Jiang Junchao has not made much progress. His expressions are not very suitable for the amorous young master in the play. Tang Tianxi hasn't been seen for a long time, and his style has changed, probably a little stiff. Chen Binyu, who plays A'pei, is somewhat fiery. The rest are mediocre.</p>
<h3 id="e326">Review of "A Good Night" <a href="#e326" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c326" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">326</a></h3>
<p>— Guyue</p>
<p>Speaking of the performance of "A Good Night," it can be satisfactory in many ways. This film can always give us some satisfaction.</p>
<p>Yunlin washing rice is the most brilliant scene in the film. She looks at the shadow in the well with great resentment, and when the bucket is lowered, it disperses the resentful shadow piece by piece. The photography is excellent, and the expression is also profound. It can truly portray a widow suppressed under the old ethics, feeling boundless emotion for her youth! Therefore, Yunlin is a very difficult role to play. On the one hand, she cares about her reputation, and on the other hand, she cannot suppress the fire of her youth. Being in this dilemma, she can deal with it calmly, no matter what, it is a success.</p>
<p>Mother Liu is a believer in the old ethics, but she has the courage to expose this darkness, which implies the awakening of humanity. The expression at the time of awakening is quite successful.</p>
<p>Zhu Ying is an elementary school teacher who opposes ethics, but he finally fails! His sincere heart still cannot awaken Yunlin, and finally, this tragedy is reflected.</p>
<p>The photography has two excellent scenes, especially when Yunlin is grinding rice and looking into the well. The photography of the cypress trees and arches in Bai Village is also quite successful.</p>
<p>The director's skills are very high. He can make the distribution of the entire play obtain some very suitable talents. However, the first two scenes, when focusing on Mother Liu, are too roundabout.</p>
<p>The performance of the whole play can be satisfactory, this is the last thing to say. At the same time, it is much better than "The Wind," because "The Wind" only describes a woman who is living in the city, while "A Good Night" describes the entire unfortunate woman.</p>

<p>— Shen Fen</p>
<p>The fact that Wu Cun of Lianhua has joined Mingxing has become a reality. Now news has come that Gao Zhanfei has joined Mingxing. The contract has been signed with a monthly salary of five hundred yuan, with additional remuneration, and another attached condition, namely that his ranking, apart from Hu Die, is not below other actors.</p>
<p>It is rumored that Cai Chusheng is also wavering and there is talk of joining Mingxing as well.</p>
<p>The Taihua Company, founded jointly by playwright Zuo Mingqian and Bao Zhichao, is currently difficult to realize due to certain reasons. Zuo Ming is currently introduced by a certain gentleman to Tianyi, where he serves as a screenwriter and actor.</p>
<p>Tianyi has established a branch in Hong Kong. Shao Zuiweng specially sent his brother Shao Cunren to Hong Kong to work. It is reported that Cunren has completed discussions with colleagues in the branch company and will return to Shanghai within a few days.</p>
<p>Tianyi's "Dream of the Red Chamber" and "Spring Night Song" will be completed after filming two more large scenes. Chen Yumei will continue to star in "The Graciousness of a Beauty," adapted from Zhang Henshui's novel and scripted by Yu Si, after her starring role in "Dream of the Red Chamber" is completed. The director has been set as Qiu Yixiang.</p>
<p>Mingxing Company has sent people to Hangzhou to film news footage of the Kalachakra Initiation.</p>
<p>Tianyi's document director, Mr. Gao Tianqi, finished writing the "Lotus Picking Song" from "Dream of the Red Chamber" overnight yesterday and returned to his native Shaoxing this morning to visit his family.</p>

<p>— Uncle Ming</p>
<p>Ines and Harley took the stage. Ines was still entangled with Harley while dancing. Harley, however, showed disgust, scolding her from time to time, and repeatedly throwing her forcefully to the ground. He also cursed at her, saying: (Don't be so weak. Be careful about what you do). Ines was pushed by him and fell. She raised her head and shouted at Harley: (Harley!) Harley said: (Do you still want to be like that?) Ines said: (You, you can't leave me. I won't let you go.) Harley said: (Will you stop talking!) As he spoke, he deliberately executed a difficult step, throwing Ines out again with great force. Ines fell heavily again. Although the audience knew that this was all part of the performance, everyone was so frightened by the realistic expressions that they could barely breathe. Later, Ines said: (Are you going to take Mrs. Leonard with you?) Harley scolded: (What business is it of yours if I take her?) Ines said: (I won't let you take her!) Harley got angry and said: (Oh! You dare to interfere with my affairs!) As he said that, he pushed her hard again, and she fell to the ground. The whole audience stood up in an uproar. Al hurriedly came out to smooth things over, saying: (Everyone, please sit down and relax. This happens every night.) Ines slowly raised her head, and streaks of blood were already flowing from her mouth. She secretly pulled out the dagger from her garter and, following the rhythm of the music, suddenly stood up and went to meet Harley. When they passed each other, she said: (You can't take her away!) She stabbed the knife into Harley's chest. At the same time, the music stopped abruptly with a clang. Al understood what had happened. Harley was still holding Ines in his arms. But he couldn't stand still himself. Applause thundered from all sides. Al rushed over, pretending to congratulate them. He supported Harley and Ines, one arm around each of them. Harley was limp and barely bowed to the audience. The audience cheered again. Al took advantage of the commotion to help them inside.</p>
<p>Harley and Ines entered the dressing room, and Ines immediately fainted. When Al looked at Harley again, he was already dead. In a moment of desperation, Al immediately ran out to find Li Que. He asked Li Que to help him carry Harley's body out before Ines woke up. However, the dance hall was surrounded by police, how could they get out? So they gave a bottle of wine to a policeman outside a small door in advance. The policeman didn't care about anything once he had the wine. Al and Li Que, one on each side, propped up Harley's body, pretending he was drunk, and carried him out. They carried Harley's body all the way to Captain Flynn's car and stuffed him into the trunk. After a while, Captain Flynn came, unaware that there was a dead man in the trunk, so he got into the car and drove away. Before leaving, he even said to Al: (Goodbye, goodbye. Don't forget to buy the newspaper tomorrow.) Al waved to him and said: (Goodbye, Captain. Newspapers? Don't forget, don't forget. You only know half of it.) As he said that, he hurried into the dance hall. He didn't even have time to see Ines, and ran to his own dressing room to put on blackface makeup to perform the black people's dance to paradise.
