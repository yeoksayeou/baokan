<p>時評</p>
<h3>德國停付外債</h3>
<p>經</p>
<p>據路透電訊。本月十四日德國政府曾聲明。自本年七月一日起。包延付德國外債六個月。包括道威斯及楊格公債在內。自此項聲明公佈後。倫敦巴黎及紐約各地之與論。莫不爲之譁然。各國政府尤多提出嚴重抗議。英國方面金融家與實業家之間。雖因利益不同。而作分道揚鏕之主張。然財長張伯倫則竟於十五日在下院宣布。如德國至七月一日猶無使英國持劵人可以認爲滿意之辦法。英國將不惜於倫敦柏林之間。適用匯兌淸算制度。張氏發言後。英內閣卽十九日一致通過對德抗議緩付外債之牒文。僅此一端。已足推測此事發展之前途。或將影響歐洲政局。而使今日之糾紛更形惡化也。</p>
<p>德國自歐戰失敗以還。報効於英法諸强者至鉅。然非賴戰勝國之借欵供縮。則賠償之能力必無由繼續。人民之勞動生產亦無由進行、以世界工業最發達之德國。負世界最鉅額之外債。（計一九三三年九月底止。負債本息約一百五十億馬克。年需對外支出十億馬克之鉅）。賠欵之累。實爲主因。固無疑義。而年來支出增加。貿易逆調。又足使德國長時期之經濟恐慌爲炎變本加厝厲焉。</p>
<p>今試就德國中央財政言之。在過去三所中。柏林政府每年入不敷出者。約在五億馬克左右。本年度支出預算。比較上年度。近增加五億馬克。總額爲六十五億紀克。就中軍備支出之增加尤巨。此財政上之困維一也。其次就貿易方面言之。據德國中央銀行報告。最近該行所擁存金與外匯。較之一年以前。有如下列之轉變。</p>
<p>去年五月六日</p>
<p>存金　　　　　四零一百萬馬克　　　　一八四百萬馬克</p>
<p>外匯　　　　　　九九百萬馬克　　　　　七百萬馬克</p>
<p>發行凖備率　　　　　　九·一％　　　　　　五·四％</p>
<p>存金與外匯之低落。均足爲對外支付日形困難之說明。而出口慘跌。貨物滯銷。又爲存金外流之理由。此貿易上之困難二也。</p>
<p>由上述各端之夾擊。德國乃不能不出於停付賠欵之最後步驟。今若英法諸國。必欲强迫支付。縱不至再蹈法比聯軍佔領魯爾之覆轍。然此而發生之市塲戰爭。或不可免。屆時。英國固可截留德國之出口貨欵。德國亦未嘗不可封鎖市塲。以爲報復。雙方果至各走極端。斷絕貿易來往。自給社會之狀態。亦必使兩敗俱傷而已。</p>
<p>停付外債。已爲近年來司空見慣之現象。如英法意比及南美各國。皆已有其先例。固非肇端於德。此後經濟恐慌愈甚。則停付之舉愈多。影響及。豈僅當事國外債信用之動搖而已。已以今日國際經濟關係之密切。往往可以牽一髮而動全身。是在高見遠囑之政治家。體察入微。當機立斷。酌量通融。俾得稍蘇元氣。否則竭澤而漁。亦非智才之所爲也。</p>

<h3>海軍初步談判　英美日三角鬥爭　美認日欲平等理由不足　日使松平聞訊頗覺不安</h3>
<p>（倫敦）每日捷報政治記者今日稱、海軍談活之地位、殊不樂觀、欲得較人海軍、英國欲得新戰艦與更多巡艦、而美國則對要求似欲置諸不理、日本現凖備提出在中國海及西太平洋自由行動之要求、果爾、則海軍會議不待開會、卽將打銷矣云、（二十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）今日此間海軍界皆以日本所提出華盛頓海軍公約五·五·三比率必須修正之要求爲議論之資料、東京海軍省發言人今日發出此種要求、並聲稱、如謂日本在財政上不能與他國作造艦競爭、則屬錯誤云倫敦美國海軍中人批評東京言論謂日本所提出之理由、殊欠堅强、必須提出更有力之理由、以擁護其要求、然後其要求方可爲人所討論中雲、英国官塲以爲東京現已提出一種問題、其關係於美國者較諸英國尤爲重要、如日本果要求同等、則英國將抱何種態度、今日未能逆料、美國前海軍、戰術股主任濮拉特將軍近在外交雜誌中披露一文、批評日本海軍同等之要求、此文在倫敦人士觀之、可爲华盛顿官塲一般意思將决定</p>
<p>一九二五年海軍會議中美國政策者之正確反吹、衆意濮拉特將軍所言者、確爲參加目前初興海軍談話之英美代表對於日本廢除比率原則之要求所欲言者、倫敦日使署已接到華盛頓傳來濮拉特將軍言論之大旨、故日大使松尘與其海軍顧問今日頗覺不寗、聞彼等似以爲英美兩國現已處於同舟共濟之地位、預防海軍會議之失敗矣、</p>
<h3>英美續談內容</h3>
<p>今日英美雙方代表在唐寗街十號相邸續作海軍談話、英相麥唐諾詳述英國在世界各處之責任、及其有充分艦隊以履行此責任之需要、出席者美方爲台維斯·平漢·萊氏與阿塞頓四人、英方爲首相麥唐納海相孟塞爾·李德爾與克萊基四人、今日發言者僅英相一人、英相發言旣畢、　代表覺其言含有英國欲在下屆談判中首當其衝之意、英相今日所言者、皆人所共悉之各點、無非申說英國絕對依賴海外食物與原料之供給、及英國在世界各處尤其是太平洋兩旁英屬自治地、負有政治上責任與義務等情形、英相又言及英國在印度之地位、在中国日本及亚洲其他诸国之商業關係、及完成新加坡軍港之前途、英相日言及因法意間僵局面起的地中海海軍問題中英國所遇之不定局勢、英相此番言論、殆可表示英國欲得自由、增多其巡艦噸數、查九年前海軍條約限定、國巡艦噸數、包括大小巡艦在內、爲三十三萬九千噸、（二十日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英美兩國代表、在此間舉行海軍會議初步談判、對於未來海軍會議所應採取之程序、似尙未從長研究、據聞英國方面、對於該國海軍政策、僅作廣汎之說明、卽英美兩國專家、當於明日舉行會議者、關於工作方針、亦僅接到槪括訓令、並無其他較詳細之指示、今晨某報載稱、英美代表談話時、美國代表當於海軍會議純粹技術問題之外、提及菲律濱羣島問題、緣美國對於菲律濱獨立後之運命、頗爲憂慮、故欲使英日各國、發表宣言、保障菲律濱羣島之中立云、據消息靈通方面言、美國代表在其居留倫敦期內提出此項問題、非不可能之事、至於英國方面、對此提議如何接受、則其態度大約如下、卽英國贊成與各國共同發表宣言以保證菲律濱之中立、但對於違反宣言者、加以制裁、則必爲英國所拒絕、英國對於此層、所能擔任之義務、至多亦不過承認與關係各國互相諮商而已云（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英美海軍專家今日集議兩小時、聞英專家已發表其對於技術問題之意見、美代表亦將有所表示、然後將作總討論、據、近美代表者聲稱、美國鑒於因世界經濟會議失敗而起全世界之不良情</p>
<p>感、故苟無成功之良好氣象、則不願加入任何新會議、如目前討論發現過分之異見、則美國或將感覺在若無期展緩會議之爲愈云、（二十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英美兩國海軍專家今晨在外交部舉行第一次會議、美國方面代表出席者、爲海軍少、將賴氏、及美國紸英大使館參贊阿德頓、英國方面代表出席者爲海軍參謀長海軍中將李德爾、及外交部美洲司長克萊齊、（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）工黨「每日民聲報」外交問題記者、爲又論海軍會議初步談話、爲「海軍談話之危機」道及英日兩國在初步談判中、所能提出之要求、據稱關於日本要求英美政府、由可靠方面得悉東京政府、意</p>
<p>欲與英美成立恊定、世界各大洋、今爲若干势力範圍、每一國家、在其勢力範圍之中、各項維持和平之責任、並享受此貢權利、日本計畫之眞正意義、乃欲在中國及西部太平洋、取得自由行動之權、各國如能以此相許、則日本對於海軍噸數、卽不堅决要求平等、而可將原定海軍比率略加修改、卽五·五·三、改爲五·五·四是也、如各國對於勢力範圍一層、不能予日本以滿意則日本必堅求海軍平等、第就大勢而論、足爲海軍會議成功之威脅者、不僅限於日本之要求、卽英國方面之意向、亦殊可慮、蓋英國有兩種要求、一爲增加巡洋艦雙數、一爲重行建造他項艦艇、因此二者均足使海軍會　爲之動搖、該報結論、謂槪括言之、海軍會議形式如下、卽日本要求較强之海軍、英國要求建造新艦、美國則徬徨不定、凡此種種、皆非良好現象也云云、（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英允不談政治</h3>
<p>（東京）日政府於五月十七日對於英國關於召開十次海軍會議之請貼發出回答、略謂、日本認下次會議專討論純粹海軍兵力量之技術的問題、而絕對反對觸及一切政治問題、據聞松平大使於十八日會見英首相麥克唐納時、詢問英國對於日本此項方針之意嶔時、麥首相亦表示同意、於是日政府最關心之政治問題被除外、預備會商專談手續疫題、備砲口徑艦型縮少、等各技術問題、（二十一日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）外務省今日接到松平大使與美代表台維斯於十九日會見之公電、然其內容未經發表、不能窥知、憑他方消息、台维斯關於軍縮會議之地點及時期、對松平謂、美國不反對在倫敦開會、然明年初因美国会开幕、希望於五六月間開會、兩人交換關於一般問題之意見外、未談及具體問題、（二十一日聯電）</p>

<h3>意法造艦競爭</h3>
<p>（巴黎）茲據新聞報之記載、意大利近已决定建築各具三萬五千噸排水量之鐵甲艦二艘、新聞報認此係對於法國東克爾格戰艦建造之一種答復、該報復稱、法國東克爾格戰艦之建造、現非但日爲意大利之新建造所超越、且東克爾格在未入水之前、實已等於無用、故此實爲最可</p>
<p>遺憾之事、而墨索里尼之簽訂該項建造</p>

<p>（倫敦）路透社今日據負責方面通吿、日本報紙所載英荷兩國已訂定秘密恊定、對於遠東軍務與經濟各事取共同之陣綫云云、此说實無根據、又馬來英軍總司令不日將赴荷蘭之說、亦屬無稽、（二十日路透電）</p>
<h3>本年十一月　美艦隊調回太平洋　九月中在南大西洋面　作大規模操演六星期</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）海軍部長史璜生今日宣布、美國艦隊將於十月一日錢部調回太平洋長期停駐、在駛返太平洋之前、全部艦隊將於九月十七日開往占巴康泰那摩海灣作大規模之操演、操演之期預定六星期、然後再用最迅速之方法、穿過巴拿馬運河面回太平洋、史氏稱、前於四月二十四五兩日軍艦八十八艘、僅費四十七小時駛過巴拿馬運河、今尙擬再行增加速度、海軍部以爲駛過運河之計畫、應以全部艦隊爲原位、而這願作冒險之嘗試、據海軍當局計算、此次艦隊駛返太平洋之費用、卽燃料一項亦需二百萬元美金云、查　國艦隊自一九三二年以來、卽全部駐泊太平洋、至今年四月始移泊大西洋、海軍當局雖稱久駐太平洋係通常訓練計畫、然當時遠東局勢緊張、頗令世人作種種揣測、及美國承認蘇俄、艦隊卽調赴大西洋、於是美俄聯合制日之說、亦自然消減、此次重行東返、當可不致引起恐慌也、（二十日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）海軍部長史璜生今日宣布、美國海軍部已放棄建造飛行甲板巡艦之計畫、惟否認此項决定係國務院請求之結</p>
<p>果云、此間上星期中盛傳國務院請求海軍部放棄建造該項巡艦之計畫、因倫敦及華盛頓兩條約中皆未曾載及也、據史氏之表示、則海軍部之放棄、純以該項巡艦不切實用云、（二十日國民電）</p>

<p>抵滬之新順天輪船及船主（亞東社龔叔賢攝）</p>
<h3>匪爲北方人</h3>
<p>據該輪買辦談、此次刦掠新順天輪之匪盜、盡係北方人、山東直棣奉人口當均有、匪衆共約三十名左右、匪首及匪助手等四人、在塘沽上船時、係乘官艙、其他匪衆則散居統艙、新順天於十七日下午四時離津、至當夜十時半、匪盜先在統艙內、以潰失衣服爭吵爲由、卽蜂擁出艙、動手刦掠、匪首自稱　　王師長、首在劉珍年部下帶兵匪衆　帶武器、全爲最新式之盒子砲</p>
<h3>行刑稱報復</h3>
<p>匪首自稱王師長　、曾對順天輪船員言、若帶退職後、本恃代運貨物爲生、大致由大連口岸私裝人造絲、及其他商稅率之洋貨、潛運到烟津靑島各地、　天津海關檢查漏稅貨甚嚴、先後兩次、被烟津兩關查去之貨、値洋一百七十萬元、以是憤恨海關、終乃計劃行刦洋商輪、使釀成棘手之交涉、俾資報復云云、匪首又稱、初擬行刦者爲新盛京船、旋因約定民船未到、不得不改變方針、而刦新順天輪、</p>
<h3>行刦時情形</h3>
<p>匪盜行刦、在十七日夜十時半、以失衣爭閙爲由、擁至艙外、先將無綫電臺占據、次至買辦孫讓三室、逼令孫帶引到船</p>
<p>主間、並令逐一指認船員、兼當通譯、孫被匪勒逼引導、後乃改換、買辦陳和卿君、陳君爲匪威逼奔馳、歷十六小時之久、匪首占據買辦賬房間爲發號施令之大本營、匪首且有賬房一人、代爲管理贓物、蓋極有組織者也、匪盜在輪行刧先後共歷十八小時之久、旅客經四次之搜刦、巨細洗刦無餘、</p>
<h3>損失之一斑</h3>
<p>船內旅客共有日人杉本一名、及西人十名、又小孩三名、中國旅客總共八十五人、匪盜行刦、搜檢極詳、故旅客之所帶現欵、幾盡被刦去、其中最多者約　千元、最少者亦有數十元、匪盜於三五元少數、則仍擲還、有一西婦被刦飾物値一千六百元、次刦中國女客三人、幸由陳和卿君一再向匪討情、得未搜刦、保全甚多、大致旅客方面損失至少　三萬元、船上賬房間損失四千餘元、孫買辦損失一千餘元、船主損失一千餘元、其他船員與管事等損失亦有一千餘元也、</p>
<h3>綁架時狀况</h3>
<p>匪盜於刦掠後、卽綁架旅客船員、初欲將船主架去、經陳和卿君力求、乃改架二副、匪首又欲綁架西婦及中國女客三人、又經陳君一再情商、並認三華婦爲表親、始允未架、故西首令擇年輕山東籍人架之而南方人則槪未綁架、不知何意、至被綁之日人杉本、態度最從容、且有華僕隨匪同去、</p>
<h3>羅斯中四槍</h3>
<p>三副羅斯共被匪擊中四槍、三槍在手臂上、一槍在腦骨擦過、其中槍原因、爲羅斯在盜匪兩人威逼時、羅氏年輕力大、</p>
<p>起而抵抗將一匪抱住、用手力扼匪喉、匪已危殆、另一匪急開槍擊羅、羅斯受傷後、倒在船主室門口因夜中疑已身死、匪首當誡飭其衆、何故開槍殺人、　匪意亦不欲殺人也、後由陳君發覺其未死、乃商同匪意、由船主將羅斯包紥傷處扶入室內、始獲救治、</p>
<h3>民船送軍械</h3>
<p>民船五艘、確爲匪所預雇、蓋Ｔ一二八五號在途中卽隨輪而行、Ｔ一四四號民船、更于順天拋泊時靠近船邊、送上機槍兩架、步槍不少、並子彈　箱、蓋防在船發生衝突也、又烟東一二○九號、及一○七二號、一　五號等三艘、均供匪裝載贓物、及綁架之人、匪首王師長與架去之五外人、及日人之僕、係上一○七二號民船、中國旅客二十人、係下一二五○號船、另有不知號碼之民船一艘　在二十丈外、亦爲接應匪盜者</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>怎樣建設大衆文學</h3>
<p>丨答王道李小明兩君並就敎於陳望道陳子展兩先生丨</p>
<p>因爲日來本報自由談上接連發表了幾篇陳望道陳子展諸先生的關於「建設大衆語文學」的論文，於是引起許多讀者向我們提出疑問。他們問：大衆語與白話的分别究在那裏？這樣的把問題提出，是不是重翻「五四」的舊賬？大衆語文學究竟應該怎樣來建設？關於這些問題，陳先生等雖有論及，但有的不詳，有的僅僅觸到問題的邊際，爰縷述我們的意見，作爲關心這問題的讀者們的參考。</p>
<p>我們必須首先承認陳先生等提出的大衆語問題，在文學運動的現階段，是非常正確和切要的。文學的「大衆化」，在目前，已成爲文學創作者和讀者大衆們一致的要求。要表現大衆生活，只有用大衆自已的語言方得達到成功，也可以說，在大衆的實生活中，已孕育着大衆語言的成長，只待我們採用。這不僅不是重複「五四」的舊賬，而是把語言運動推進到一個新的階段，加强了自身的任務。「白話」，誠如陳于展先生所說：只是知識份子一個階層的東提，它一方面是把官僚士大夫的敎士語做範本（借望道先生語）。另一方面却無條件的引用外來的買辦語，（我們以爲「五四」時代所成就的白話，是官僚買辦語，是非常恰當的），而完全與大衆的生活，語言相隔離。我們常常在現在出版物中看到許多比古文更難懂的文句，便是由於這樣的原因。」等到社會進到一定階段時，它便反而成了語言運動的障礙，意識地阻止了大衆語言的發展，而顯現出一種非驢非馬的窮相。所以，目前的大衆語運動，是反古文的，同時是反官僚買辦的白話的。</p>
<p>因爲這樣，我們對於這問題，决不應該採取消極的態度，應該積極地從兩重任務的奮鬥</p>
<p>中獲取它的勝利。陳子展先生一聽到古文復興的口號並不感到重要」的「容忍」態度，我們認爲不很好。「古文復興」决不是幾個遺老企圖死灰復燃，而是與尊孔，提倡讀經配合而來的。「大勢所趨」，雖然「最後的勝利不會歸到他們」，但僅是那些「回環曲折」；也足以使歷史的發展遲延若干年，何况「我們不置死敵人，敵人終於要置死我們」，這種敎訓，歷史上隨處可以找出例證。我們必然地要具有戰鬥的精神來處理這問題，我們要精確地對於「古文復興來一次新的估量，然復終予致命的打擊。其次陳子展先生僅僅認大衆語比白話進一步，「提倡大衆語」，是「爲了要糾正白話文學許多缺點」，這樣的認識，同樣是不够的。他没有看出白話是大衆語作戰的對象，大衆語之與白話之與古文同樣是對立的東西。我們如忽視了這一任務，我們則要走上「五四」的覆轍，便不能完成這一大衆語運動的任務。我們要反對古文，我們更要反對似是而非的洋八股。</p>
<p>那末，大衆語是什麼呢？大衆語是大衆表達自己生活，從大衆自己生活中成長起來的語言，大衆語文學就是陳望道先生所說：「大衆說得出，聽得懂，寫得順手，看得明白」的文學；大衆語是有普遍性的，是時時發展着的，它與各地土語不同。（以前有人主張用土語寫文學作品，這是錯誤的，雖然我們不妨採用土語）土語是封建社會的產物，大衆語乃該是完全反封建買辦的語言，雖然在現在，還顯現不出它的全面，但隨着大衆生活的進展，各地方大衆間的生活語言的隔膜，逐漸打破，而適合大衆生活的新的字彚、日益增加、大衆語終於要達到完成。這從語言與文字發展的本身上，固可以尋出它發展的途徑，（這一點望道先生已經說得非常明白了）。卽從社會學的見地來考察，也不難發現它的根源。</p>
<p>我們旣認定大衆語不是什麼人創造出來的，而是隨着大衆生活的進展而進展的東西，在建設大衆語的現階段，我們便不容忽視，不僅是要接近大衆，要從大衆中學得習用的語言，我們更要體騐大衆的生活，了解大衆生活實際情形，懂得大衆生活是在怎樣的發展。大衆能够聽得懂看得明白「摩登」，「摩托」，「冰淇淋」這些字彙，是因爲大衆生活已進行到和這些字彙接觸的時候，二十年前對鄕下人談筆命，他們最多只知道是等於「長毛造反」，但現在却連三歲小孩子也差不多了解這字的意義了。離開大衆生活，則你無由去「輸入大衆所懂的外路語」，或起用古語。這一點是陳望道先生所已觸到而未深入地說明的。</p>
<p>總之，大衆語問題的提出，是非常有意義的，但如果我們不把大衆生活作爲充實這一問題的內容，卽是不使這運動與大衆生活的進展相配合，這運動便依然要陷於空洞無物，旣不能克服敵人，更不能得到解决。</p>
<p>本文因篇幅限制，對於這問題只能槪括地論及，有未觸到處，只有待到下次有機會時再提西出來討論。</p>

<p>春秋御香縹緲錄  淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯　　這四輛車上的佈置的詳細情形，我可以用最簡單的幾行統計來說明：　　（一）爐灶五十座，　　（二）廚子上手五十人，　　（三）廚子下手五十人，　　（四）洗滌夫等雜差詳數不明，　　（五）共備正菜一百種，　　（六）糕點，水菓，糖食，乾菓等亦一百種。　　看了這些，便不難知道大槪的情形了。在中國，「食」的問題原是非常講究的，認眞寫起來，一兩厚册的「食譜」眞可一揮立就；所以作者在這一章裏所記的，實在祇是極小極小的一部份而已！　　皇太后的一生，可說便是爲着「吃」而生存的！這話並非侮辱，就是我自已，丨伊的一個女官丨也是如此。我們無論在什麼時候，總是討嫌吃的東西太多，不會嫌吃的東西太少。不但內廷裏的食物如此豐富，便在我們自己家裏，備的東西雖不能全像宮裏那般的珍貴，數量也比較少一些，但是我們每個人，都可以儘量的吃，甚至吃得失了滋味，下次一見這東西就頭痛。　　宮裏面又有一個特殊的習慣：為習慣的來源已不是百年中間的事了，因此也没有人再能說明它的用意。祇知道太后或皇上每一次正餐，必須齊齊整整的端上一百碗不同的菜來。（譯者按：此處恐係過分形容，不可盡信。）（六四）小菜場的衰象  花鈴　　不景氣籠罩着這個夙有東方巴黎之號的大都市，同時也侵襲到了這個大都市裏的各個小菜塲。魚販子對着攤上的　魚發着怔，一天，二天，三天，僅僅賣掉了十份之三四。三個子兒一條的小黄魚，十六個子兒一條的大黄魚，每天批得少，也賣完，批得多，也賣完，新鮮的，有主顧，臭的爛的，也有主顧。　　肉店老閭的肚子，如今也不比從前挺得那麼樣高了。買一塊二塊的錢的，自然是竭誠招待，就是買三百文或一角小洋腿精的，一樣的裝起了笑臉相迎。在以前，一角小洋，已是最低的限度了，但現在是二百大錢，也可請肉店倌高抬一一下子貴手，據說是拉拉後來生意。　　莊稼人種菜，供都市裏消費，是誰都知道可以發財的。但是，在這勢口裏，小菜塲裏的菜販子，都不能把靑菜賣善價了，怎還輪得到莊稼人發財？瞧哪，菜價在十幾個，或二十幾個子兒一斤時，才有主顧，若是每兩五六十文，那麼，主顧們會咕囉着「靑菜賣肉價了」，而頭也不回的上豆腐攤去賣白馬肉了，雖然在從前，賣一角小洋一兩，只要是時鮮，是不愁没人光顧的。　　花攤上的鮮花，儘着迎人苦笑，但大多數是終於香消色褪，而就枯萎在花攤上，而被棄的。坐薦頭  賢賢　　農村是破產了。農村裏的娘兒們，都提了小包裹，上上海來當「娘姨」。年輕而生得矮小的，當「大姐」。原因是毛囝娘，在上海當了三年娘姨，手上戴起金戒指來了。十根家的阿寳，在上海當了半年大姐，脚上穿起絲襪來了。　　不錯，在上海，從南到北，幾乎每一條街上，平均至少有一個門面上，掛着『姑蘇×老薦頭』，『寗紹老薦頭』，或『維揚×記薦頭店』的招牌。而且每一家薦頭店裏的長凳，老是給候補的娘姨大姐坐滿了。　　但是『坐薦頭』，據說也不是容易的。坐一天，得交一天房飯錢，坐十天，便得交十天房飯錢。農村裏的娘姨大姐，大量的輸入上海，可憐這年頭兒，上海也正閙着不景氣，十家中倒至少有一半，正在家庭裏緊縮裁員，怎能消納這多的娘姨大姐？　　娘姨大姐坐薦頭，掏腰包貼房飯錢，腰包掏乾了，只得再背起小包裹，回到老家去，於是坐在薦頭店裏的，都是些陌生面孔的娘姨大姐了。　　十個坐薦頭的，偶而有一個給人雇去了，於是忙着找保，交薦頭錢。没有人雇去的，瞧着好不眼紅，但是已找到飯碗的，兀是怨天怨地，因爲投到了一個窮東家，是没出息的。但並此窮東家而找不到的，便只得整天的坐在薦頭店裏，仰着脖子嘆氣。上海的骯髒是掃除不盡的太極操講習班表演記  南宮生　　去歲之夏，敎育部以褚民誼氏之提倡太極操，主辦體育班，內設太極操一科，卽由褚擔任敎授，各地遂競相仿效。海上體育班同學會，亦組織太極操研究會，推沈寳倫顧舜華阮蔚村蔣集成李實五人爲委員，會員共二十餘人，先後應海上各校之聘爲義務敎授。日來益形發達，致人數不足分派，乃與中華體育會同作，設立太極講習班，以期普及，班址則設於城內萬竹小學，及法租界東新橋研究會本址，仍以褚爲導師，開辦以來，頗著成效。前日褚，由京來滬，於萬竹舉行講習班表演，來賓參觀者甚衆，有敎育局長潘公展，招商局秘書長徐致一，國術分館太極拳敎師趙壽臣等，徐趙二人，皆爲太極拳第一名手吳鑑泉之門人，精太極拳，與褚爲同門。兩江女子體育師範太極操班，亦到會參觀。先由褚演說太極操之效用與練習方法，并操演手法，次全體攝影之後，卽由兩江女子體校太極操表演，動作齊整。操畢，有一老者，同十歲小兒表演太極拳，甚精粹可觀。繼後卽講習班表演，由交通大學體育敎員呼口令，全班共四十餘人，皆能動作不逾範圍，非易事也。褚復擬請徐趙二君演太極拳推手，則以爲時已晏，自八時開會，已迄十二時餘，故未能表演，祇可待諸下次開會時矣。拉雑話新生活運動的誤解  兪友淸　　自從蔣委員長，提倡了新生活運動以後，眞可謂登高一呼，羣山響應，在這四維不張的時候，恢復吾國固有的美德，這也是一件對症發藥的事，不過有許多愚昧無知的細民，很容易誤解的，每每借了新生活運動做幌子，作爲宣傳的工具，這種流弊，也許免不掉的吧！　　像前幾天的蘇州，不知道那一隻廟宇中賽會，在儀仗中間，有一對旗子，上面寫着：「擁護新生活運動，」和「革命事業成功，」好像很知道新生活和革命的重要，不過後面有百禁牌上寫着：「一禁三民主義，」這不是太不成話了嗎？同時又有五色的國旗，更是荒謬絕倫了。　　我的故鄕丨常熟，在六月六日那天，舉行划舟競賽會，是不是鄕村地方划龍船的變相，恕我作客他方，不知道其中底蘊，不過他們的啓事，刋在報上，倒也十分冠冕堂皇，有幾句話：「力今新生活運動一日千里之際，凡足以淬勵蹈揚，振作精神之競技遊賽，適合於禮義廉恥，：：：」好像又把新生活運動，作爲幌子了　　還有别的地方，像掉龍燈等，都以新生活運動相標榜，然而事實完全是相反的，這不是誤解了新生活運動的眞義嗎？　　同胞們！看淸了目標，認淸了方針，不要閉了眼睛，糊塗的瞎閙了。新生活與新飲料  瞻廬　　中國人一切生活，恒受支配於舶來品之下，物質如是，精神亦如是。物質敝屣國粹，而惟舶來品之是尙，於是金錢外溢，有加垑已，而中國之經濟破產。精神敝屣國粹，而惟醉心於舶來品之過激學說，於是人心世道，日就淪胥，而中國之道德破產。蔣委員長之提倡新生活，蓋有怵乎經濟道德之破產堪虞，不得不力謀拯救之方也。登高一呼，應者四起，新生活之運動，於是乎有雲蒸霞蔚之觀矣。　　旣言新生活，當有新禮貌，旣言新禮貌，當有新饮料。管子所言之四维，旣以禮爲之首，而禮之所寓，實以飲料爲之首。試觀任何家庭，聞有客至，必以飲料餉客。飲料之中，判爲茶酒；一般醉心歐化者，旣以咖啡代中國之香茗，又以香檳白蘭地代中國之醇醪，抑何敝屣國粹一至於此也。自經新生活實行以後，咖啡餉客之舉，漸知改革，惟有娛賓之醇醪，仍不免仰給於舶來之飲料。人有譏之者，輒曰：吾非不知愛國也，特憾無相當國產以代之耳。　　噫嘻！爲斯言者，其果出於誠意乎？如其然也，則國產之烟台啤酒，其品質之精良，實出於舶來品之上，而且完全爲華商所經營，十餘年之信譽，久已膾炙人口。用以餉客，則以愛國之心待人，用以自娛，則以愛國之心自待。必如是，乃可與言新生活，乃可與言新禮貌，戲撰三字經，以頌新飲料：　　有啤酒，烟台造。裝潢美，價錢巧，質地良，滋味好。來欵客，斟瓊瑤。或自娛，飲瑪瑙。舶來品，何足道？新生活，在禮貌。新禮貌，在飲料。新飲料，烟台造，記牌號，雙頭鳥。東北四連長  張恨水第十三回　目送哀鴻埋頭守國土　彈穿勁臂灑血染孤城　　他想到這樣的黑夜，若是擦出火光來，更會引起敵人的注意，於是伸出手來，把抽烟的這人意思打銷他，正站在這裏，不知怎樣，才可排除心裏頭這一番苦悶。忽然一個傳令兵走了來，說是營長命令殷連長限二十分鐘退到堡裏去。殷得仁聽了這道命令，心裏十分不高興，自己獎勵了弟兄們一陣，凖備敵人到來，先殺個痛快。現在魂影也不見，就要退到堡裏去，未免减了自己的銳氣。可是營長的命令又不容違抗，只好按住了一腔火氣，帶着全連弟兄委委屈屈，走進堡去。剛進堡門，營長又下令，一道命令，將堡門抵塞，立刻上城禦敵。殷得仁也不知營長有什麼把握這樣的安排，且按着命令去辦再說。果然，只等他走上了堡墻垜子，東門方面，卜卜卜，一陣機關槍響，同時，城外約兩千米達的所在，冒出了火光，也向城頭上放過槍來。殷得仁呌道：好小子，他們來了。於是兩手扶着城垜，伸頭向城外注視着，那敵人在東門外應擊而外，在西南北三門，却是没有動靜。他心裏想着敵人也是沉着的偷襲過來，可惜我不在城外，要不然，湊不冷子，這一下凖可以先殺倒他們一批人。心理如此想着，又偏了頭，將耳朶向外聽着。他用了全副的精神注意着，彷彿聽得第一道戰壕那裏有些響動。料着敵人過到二三兩道戰壕要感到一些困難，决會在那裏躊躇一會子，那未，這就是個射擊的機會了。在士兵手上取過一挺機關槍，放在垜口裏，比好了距雖，半斜了身子，偏藏在垜後，睜了兩隻大眼，在黑暗裏望着前面。（四一五）</p>

<p>自由談「心理描寫」  穆木天　　文學，應是人的描寫，人間社會的描寫，這是誰都不會否認的。已爾札克作了他的「人間喜劇」，生在現代的我們，是也應當創造我們的時代的人間喜劇的。然而，人是有他的欲望，他的要求，他的情感，他的心理反應的。當然，在描寫人的時候，心理描寫，是一個很重要的手法的。這也是誰都不會否認。　　心理描寫，自然，是現實的手法之一。偉大的作家，須是一個心理學者。對於人的正確的認識，是不僅要知道他的外貌，而且要知道他的內心。這樣說，作品中的心理描寫，是有重要的意義的。然而，如果作家想作人物的心理描寫，他必用工夫作實在的人物之心理解剖，心理分析。不作客觀的人物之心理的解剖與分析，而只是主觀地，虛構地，用妙想去捏制人物的心理，這是違背現實的。那種的心理描寫，是我們要攻擊的。　　在現在的中國，所發達的，不是心理解剖，而是一種心境的排泄。作者所要描寫出的，不是客觀的人物的成爲性格特徵的心理，而是把一時浮在自己心中的一種雲霧般的東西，藉着幾個架空的人物流露出來。這種無現實性或不大有現實性的心理描寫，我稱之爲心境主義。我以爲，如果心理解剖是由現實主義的態度出發，而心境主義則是由唯美主義的態度出發。作者之對於人生的態度，是一個重要的問題。依據於科學的心理解剖所作的心理描寫，是我們所要肯定的。　　不過，我們所要切實地注意的，是：心理解剖，并非是現實描寫之手法的一切。向着「心理小說」而努力，是不可以的。人是社會的動物，人是行爲的動物。人的行爲，人的生活，是複雜的。除了較少的塲合之外，心理是透過着行動被表現出來的。也可以說，心理的描寫，在大部分的塲合，是透過生理描寫而被實映出來的。把心理解剖，當作補助的手法則可，當作手法的一切，是會弊害百出的。作家所要注意的，還是社會生活的人間的行爲。　　在性格表現上，間接描寫法，是比直接描寫法有效得多。但這不是否定直接描寫法之有時成爲必要的。心理的解剖，不應是長的獨白式的自剖，和對話式的哲學論辯。自然，獨白式的自剖和對話式的哲學論辯，有時，用得適宜，是有效果的。可是，心理解剖，成爲論文式的報告，也是不好的。十九世紀末西歐的心理小說丨丨自然，那是對自然主義所起的反動丨丨如果我們詳細地去讀，是不是感到其中的空虛呢？如布爾及（Bourget）的小說，也只是一種心理折公式主義。離開廣大的社會生活，廣汎的人間行動，而對於人生的態度是虛僞的話，那時，心理描寫，是越法地會使作品觀念論化的。　　對於眞實的作家，心理描寫，是不失爲現實的手法之一，但是，要知道的，那只於是一種補助的手法。而且，作心理描寫時，人物的心理之raison　d,etre(存在的理由）是要被指示出來，而更須用各種不同的方式直接地，或間接地，描寫或暗示出來人物之心理動態的眞實的形象，不宜一味地作說明式的平舖的直叙。秀珍！  蒲風　　秀珍，幹嗎你離開了家？　　家裏不比上海好嗎？　　丨丨汽車正在你家門前跑，　　飛機不也整天在天空裏過？　　　×　　　　　×　　哦！陽光耀眼的五月，　　秀珍姑娘離别了家鄕，　　年老的爹媽擦着眼淚，　　小火輪把她拖到都市上！　　　×　　　　　　×　　工廠整天在喊呌，　　都市張開了巨大的口：　　它，呑没過當年美麗活潑的表姐，　　如今，它的舌又探上了她的頭！商學院公演觀後感（中）  白薇　　他只是站在男性中心的立塲上，看成妻子對丈夫要絕對貞操，再由個人主義的姿態，以嫉妬心出發，盡情盡量地發揮了疑心妬心的暴風雨。　　這樣疑心與妬心的暴風雨，凄苦地灑滿了他離别四年後歸來的家庭，而打散他們前途的幸福。他不能相信他愛妻的淸自；也不能體量他愛妻和美國軍官發生愛情的自然性與必然白；更不能原諒他愛妻底這個事跡，而用更男性的誠摯與强力，把愛妻緊緊地找回來。他只專門是嫉妬，疑心，弄不淸的嫉妬與疑心。只會聲聲口口罵愛妻是「賤婦！賤婦！」，而且要愛妻說：「那男子是個下流，是個罪人。」並且疑心見鬼地說：「啊，到處有他的影子追逐我，他現在還在這兒，他動着，他好像活在你面前似地。」這是多末險惡的疑心，壓住了他底理性呵！　　他旣然以絕對貞操的鎖練，套着了女人身上，又要求女子必然是仙女，聖女。女子一失節或有别愛，便是人們所不齒的罪人。他自己却那樣不了解，對於貞勒是那末蔑視，冷罵，對勒郎施只是發出一些狡滑的疑問，一些深微的省察，一顆反覆無常，不肯眞正地相信她，不肯眞正地了解她的心。這眞無怪忠心於他的勒郎施，苦痛地等了他四年的勒郎施，終於忍受不住而變心。而且大膽地對他說道：「我以前是貞操而又誠實的，但你太無理了，你把我逼反了。」她又說：「我對你是忠實的，你現在和將來，都占着我的心的最好的一部分．請你信我，我並不是去找尋一個新的生活，而是逃避一個苦痛的生活。」　　眞的，决不是侮辱能使她感動，也不是兇暴的强力能留住她，無情的生活，旣把她心愛的人所有的那種頂壞的地方顯給她看了，她不得已，只好决心跟那向她獻過溫柔的美國軍官去。這就是疑妬的暴風雨掀起的浪潮。　　舞台上，這些浪潮是很好看的。差不多像女人披着綣曲的長髮在耳鬢飄，像女人穿着溫文爾雅在地拖的長旗袍，像女人穿着四寸的高跟鞋一樣漂亮。也同樣是展開了糜費的，開倒車的，一種頹廢而且反動的傾向。　　不是麼？一九二六年中國革命正緊張的時候，女子簡單的裝束决不像現在這溫文閒雅，眞像太平天上底遊仙般的裝束！自從公演了「炭礦夫」「西綫無戰事」到公演「重燃壞了的火」這樣的劇本，可見舞台劇方面之不能伸張，只有後退，事實上也演着同樣的變遷。　　一個以描寫嫉妬心理爲中心的劇本，它的內容在究明一個專制魔的愛情，與一個被貞操觀念束縛着的忠實的女子的愛情之演變，它所表現的思想是那樣落後，返古，它的演出又沉悶到再不能沉悶。鄕親  劉明　　丨丨千崖回憶記之一丨丨　　「記着，請你一定給我帶『草標』回來哪！」　　憶起從前到過的地方丨丨千崖土司的舊城，恍惚間彷彿又聽見了這麼一句託囑的話語。那是在晴明的早上，鄕下的擺夷人，羣隻在街頭（只有一條街，雖然名爲舊城）擺着小菜和土產一類的東西，正做着買賣。已經走了十多里的我，就同擺夷的男女擠擦着，尋覓打尖的飲食店子，但找來找去，終於一個也没有。只得走進一家漢人住的鋪面，照例客氣地喊聲：　　「對不起！老板。」　　一個老婆子拐着小足，應聲走了出來，對我從頭到足打量了一會，才溫和地問道。　　「什麼事呀？鄕親！」　　我說明要借鍋灶煮飯的事，她便毫不踟躕地答允了。又趕快拐着小足進去，給我拿個買東西的竹籃和口袋出來。同時極熱心地把當地的物價，一一告訴我，像兩「别」錢一竹筒的米呀，三個「擺燦」一塊的雞蛋呀：：：：：：：　　千崖是土司管轄的地方，屬於中國，但流行的貨幣，却全是緬甸錢，雲南的已不通用了。兩「别」錢，係緬幣的兩個Anna,三個「擺燦」，卽緬幣的三個Ｐlceo稱呼的名，則已訛成擺夷的音了。　　提着竹籃走在街頭，心裏感着彷彿他鄕遇故知那樣地溫暖，同時也聯想起先前一個小販對我說過的故事。他說的時候，先用大姆指點點他的胸口。　　「看呀，小夥子，我就是穿這麼一身，和縣知事老爺在衙門裏一塊兒吃過飯，他坐在上面，我坐在側邊。你不要吃驚！知事老爺的太太還是又穿又戴的，走了出來，笑迷迷地向我們點着頭說『各位鄕親，隨便飲點哪！」這有什麼吃驚頭！在夷人地方，就是大老爺也不能向我們擺架子的。你想想，那地方，除了我們五個做小生意的，一個漢人鬼也没有。我們五個人約着去替知事做生，他那有不高興的呢？」　　煮飯的時候，她也來帮我的忙。我便說：　　「老媽媽，讓我自家來，不要費你老人家的心了！」　　「不要緊！我曉得！」她張着很懂事的老眼睛，「你們不比别人，在路上躭擱不得的。」　　我想，奇怪了，這老婆子把我推測成什麼人呀！　　她接着又說：　　「下次走過這裏的時候，就來煮飯好了，以前小王也是來我家，他多久不來了，現在做什麼？」　　我莫明其妙，剛要回答，說是我不知道誰是小王。但她却一眼看見了幾隻母雞奔出後門，就馬上跟着趕出去，一面喊道：　　「啊喲，眞討厭！這幾個没人管的野婆娘！」　　等她把雞趕回來時，我已經在吃飯了。她忘記了小王，只是問我的姓，我老老實實地告訴了她，她就喊我道：　　「小×哥，不是我誇獎你，看你不多說話，一眼就知道你是個老實人，你比小王靠得住。這回到新街去，我要請你買點東西：：：：：：啊喲，我只是顧說話，快要散市了，你吃吧，待我去買菱哪。」　　我要動身時，她買菜回來了，拉着我的手腕囑附道：　　「錢以後補你，記着，請你一定給我帶「草標」回來哪！」　　我不知道什麼是草標，同時也想說我是一去就不轉來的，但看見她是抱那麼大的熱忱，又不好說穿，使她驟然失望，便連連點頭允道：　　「好的！好的！」　　後來，在一個么店子息足，遇見一位短衣草鞋的小夥子，身邊放着一塊小小的包袱。因爲見他是從新街來的，便問他一些關於緬甸的事情。偶然談到了草標，才知道那是緬甸人所呌的肥皂。最後問道：　　「老兄，在新街有何貴幹？」　　「我麼？没做什麼？只是跑跑信。」　　呵，啊，這下子，我才明白，那位多嘴的老婆子一定是把我當成Ｐost　Boy了。　　大約以後，她提起買肥皂的事情，定要逢人就說道：　　「啊喲，那位呌做小×的，我看他是個老實人，那知才是一點也靠不住呀！幸好没有先給錢哪！」回憶起這一件抱歉的事，總要使我有趣地微笑起來。童心  歐美著名社會諷刺畫（申報月刋社選贈）桂英爸（七）  曄子　　「有一天的半夜以後，三個西鄕人抬了一乘轎子，到我門口，我起來一看，原來是小玉患了病了，他病得很重。第二天，我和老婆子商量，想請個先生來看看。但是老婆子不肯，她說，小玉做了三個月官，並没有給她多少錢，僅有的幾個錢，只够給她做棺材本錢，這幾個錢是不拿出來的了。誰知道小玉會不會再賺錢呢？要是現在把錢拿出來給他看病，他將來倒一味跟窮人去混，不賺錢回來，那麼我的棺材不是要落空的麼？我聽了老婆子的話氣得了不得，要同她拚命。但是小玉勸住我，他說媽得了半身的病，太可憐了，呌我讓她。那幾個錢，也讓她藏着好了。他說他的病是不要緊的，只因在鄕下辛苦了幾天，有點乏力，在家靜飬幾天就會好的。他又再三勸我，呌我無論如何不要同媽閙。　　「過了幾天，桂英的校長也没得做了，回到家裏來住。老婆子非常不高興，從此每天咒罵不休。她對於小玉，還有幾分忌憚，不敢直接罵他，但是她把要罵小玉的話併到桂英頭上去。桂英終於忍不住了，有一天她問朋友借了幾塊錢，流着眼淚辭别了阿哥和我，獨自到上海去了。　　「小玉的病毫無起色，他在病中還常常問我外面的事情，平　局怎樣了？减租的事怎樣了？但是，七月初八那一天上午，警察來了，他們把小玉捉去，說我的小玉是共產黨？我拚着老命要奪小玉，但又是他勸住我，他呌我不必對警察抵抗。他說他是冤枉的，審過以後，就可放回來。他最後的話，還是呌我要讓他的媽。　　「當天下午他們把我的小玉解到省裏去了。我和小玉從此就不再見面。後來在省裏的小玉的朋友寫信告訴我說小玉是關在陸軍監獄裏，我幾回想去探監，但是老婆子不肯給我盤川，她把從前小玉給她的幾個錢看得更重了。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言我國之超格死亡統計  令威　　難得有這一機會，使我們能讀到這中國的超格死亡統計。十九日南京電：我國每年超格死亡（如自殺，溺斃，槍殺及一切因病而冤死者）據衛生署之統計，約六百萬人，以平均年齡十歲，及消費每年平均五十元計算，每年因超格死亡而損失者，達三十萬萬元。該署並以建設價値計算，計每年可建設（一）鐵路三萬里，（二）工廠八百個，（三）大學一千所，（四）小學十萬所，（五）醫院五千所，（六）自來水廠六百個，（七）柏油馬路十萬里。竟有如此驚人之損失，國人殊少注意云。這確是一個可驚的損失。　　中國人生命，向來是不値錢的。給外國人屠殺，給中國人自己屠殺。不要說自殺，溺斃，槍殺及一切非因病而冤死者等等，僅是這被公開的秘密的給中外人所共同屠殺的人們，已是一個可驚的數目。再加上水災，旱災，兵災，匪災一切等等災難所被殺被餓死的人們，我想如果精詳的仔細統計起來，其數目一定超過衛生署之統計，要多出好幾倍乃至幾十倍。如去年曾見報載，僅是江西一省，二三年來，因匪災而被殺者，達江西全省總人口二分之一，卽江西全省人口，在二三年內，很快的减少一半。這是一個多麼可驚的記載呵。我們從這記載之內，可以看到有多少無辜被慘殺的所謂「良民」，他們本來是誰都要求生的，然而結果却是死。燒死，殺死：：：我們從這統計數字之內，可以嗅到多少濃重的血腥氣。這個統計數字，簡直每一個字都用活鮮鮮的中國農民之血肉所寫成的。然而這些無辜被慘殺的中國農民，其死亡數是還不在衛生署超格死亡統計之內的。我想假使一併計算起來，其數目一定是更可驚人罷。還有四川，湖安，安徽等處，以及東三省，其被匪禍而死或爲日軍直接所殺死的中國農民與義軍，其數當更不在小數。總計起來，恐怕單是一年被殺的人數，就可以在歐洲建立一個很大的國家。這都是中國生命之源。然而現在我們所見的，却是這摧毁中國生命之源的工作。不獨外國人直接在摧毁中國生命之源，更有許多的中國人帮着外國人在做這工作。近年外國人更聰明，他自己不動手，而只呌你們自己和自己去殺去（如僞軍之殺義軍）。　　殺，殺，殺機布滿了大地。整個世界，現在正完全投入了殺機之內。卽如中國，或爲求生而殺（如强盜），或爲效命疆塲而殺（如官隊）。殺的動機雖不，而被殺的却都是中國人。衛生署超格死亡統計，何足盡中國無辜冤死都之萬一，目前正是整個流血的世界。全副精神  天華　　俺覺得中國人有一個大缺點，就是不活潑，没有精神。俺遇見過許多人，他們多數都是婆婆媽媽主義者，遇事貓貓虎虎的，全不像一個括括呌男兒漢般的有骨氣，有能爲。他們是不能爲國家建立什麼功勳的，他們是連走路都怕落重了脚步，吐痰都怕吐遠了一點的！　　俺以爲，無論什麼人，爲了自己，也爲了國家，一定要拿出全副精神來對付事情。小之，在個人方面說吧，俺站也要站得筆直挺挺的，像是在作體操一般：頭要抬得朝後仰點，像摩登娘兒們睥睨一切的那個樣子；眼要睜得圓而大，有如碧眼仁兄們對待俺們的苦力。走路要走得穩，落步要落得重。關於這一點，碧眼兒們是一個最好的榜樣。他們在馬路上散步，步步着力，不論是兩個人三個人四個人一起，全像在操塲上似的，脚步一起一落，整齐划一，絕不錯亂。俺想，這或許就是他們能欺負俺們的原因之一吧？　　不單走路，人生中的一切小事，都該像這樣用全副精神去對付的。咳嗽是小事，俺不因是小事而不咳得響一點。同樣，俺這因吐痰是小事而不吐得遠一點。同樣，點頭要點得深一點！雖不必像九十度的鞠躬，但四十五度總不算多吧？說話也要說得大聲一點。記得印度詩哲太戈爾老先生到中國來的時候，在俺大學堂裏演講，俺小子和若干同輩的朋友們對於哲學和詩歌都是莫測高深，全無興趣，但聽了他老先生那宏大嘹喨的聲音，總捨不得不聽下去。這不是一個說話必須大聲才動聽的證明嗎？若你說話像蚊蟲般嗡嗡嗡：：：則聽者固不能動容，反而要當你是病漢或没吃飯的人呢。用全副精神作事的重要，從這種小地方不可以看得出來嗎？　　還有，「獅子搏兎」，是用全副精神的，俺就應該跟獅子學樣兒纔是。又，「文王一怒而諸侯震」，俺發怒也就要發到這種地步，且須預期得到這種效果。「怒」固須這樣「盛」怒同樣，「哭」也要「痛哭」，「大哭」，「笑」也要「大笑」，「狂笑」。俺常想，天下最可憐的人是那蓋不能痛快的哭或痛快的笑的人。　　上面是就個人方面說的。在民族國家方面，若每一個國民都是不能拿出全副精神來、作事的話，則現在這個國家的種種方面，一定都是不振作的，頹廢的墮落的，民氣一定消沉，愛國一定是只有五分鐘，漢奸，奸商，賣國賊，狗</p>

<p>奴才：：：一定是必然的產物，民族性一定日趨於萎靡，淫佚，不抵抗：：：國家一定一天一天的走上牠滅亡的路途。諸君不相信嗎？俺中國目前就好像走了這樣的路子。俺中國目前就是一個抬不起頭來，不活潑，没精神的國家！　　不過，俺並不悲觀，因爲俺們的老百姓到底是在一天天的覺悟了，俺們現在就該用「全副精神」去使他們更覺悟一點，使得他們也有這個「全副精神」去作他們所應作的事情。敬老會  雅非　　日前本埠各報載，鄂省舉行敬老會消息有云；「鄂敬老會，晨十時在武昌民敎館開幕，耆英壽母，濟濟一堂，約二百餘人。張羣致開會詞：諸老精神矍鑠，程其保親扶人瑞百零一老人，黄岡朱輔臣登臺致敬，旋由各要人親題字句，贈各老作紀念而散。」吾看了這段紀事，便記起了從前曾讀過的一本增廣賢文，裏面有：「人見白頭嗔，吾見白頭喜，多少少年人，不到白頭花！」之句。這可見得白頭之可貴，而一般人要想白頭而頭終不得白，只有望黄泉而興嘆！　　「老夫耄矣，已無能爲，願你們後生靑年，自珍自愛，去創造你們廣大的前程！」從前，某要人因自己年齒老耄，所以想退居林泉，以享晚年。當時對一班年輕者這樣訓話式的說：那時他態度的嚴肅，可以想見　　　　然而話中不免有些倚老買老的口吻，可是裏面也是勉勵一般靑年的話，其意思當然是很深長的。　　時至今日，這一「老」字差不多已經落伍，一般時髦人物稱「老」爲古董，「人老珠黄不値錢」，人一到老，便不免爲時代所淘汰！幾年以前某要人和某要人在報上大開其筆戰時，某氏罵某氏云，「老而不死是爲賊」。吾想這句話，未免太尅毒，太挖苦了：人們誰保得住不要老，老了就是賊嗎？這眞是什麼話呢。　　老年人都是古董頭腦，封建思想，這句話是最普遍的，而且，誰都會這樣說的。可是，事不盡然，老頭兒有靑年思想，創造精神的，眞多着呢。像吾們的國府元首林森，監察院長于右任，上海九四老人馬相伯等，不是爲人們所欽敬的嗎？現在鄂省所舉行的「敬老會」，也是尊重這班有思想，有人格的老年人的意思。這裏着實爲一班老頭兒，揚足了眉，吐足了氣。那末，吾們後生小子，怎不一致的敬重呢？　　年高望重德厚基隆的老年人，當然是値得人們崇拜的，尊敬的。然而那些老糊塗，却實在勿必活在世上，糟塌糧草；渾渾沌沌的活着累人，倒不如早死爲愈，這對叛逆鄭孝胥輩，便是一個例子。　　本來，年紀老少，絕不能代表人之有用無用，這全憑各人的常識學問，思想腦筋，道德人格而定的，試看世界各國如，美之羅斯福，意之墨索里尼，德之希特勒，日之西園寺，那一個不是年逾不惑。然而、都有它偉大的事業，和驚人的功績；震撼着世界，動盪着世界，世界各國的情勢也隨着他們的思想而轉變。　　然反觀之吾今日的中國，却大大的不然，機關公司行號，一看到老年人，便要討厭；尤其是商店，就是倒貼他的錢，也不願意僱用的，吾不禁爲老人呼屈！　　實在的「老不搭少」；老年人同靑年人在一起，最容易發生思想上的衝突，背道而馳，兩不相容。靑年人多數是年少氣盛，而老年人则大都倚老買老，所以、年青者之同年老者，始終是不可同事共處的。不過有少數，自然例外。阿瑛  珍妮　　晚風柔和的吹着，勞苦的人們在這時候便休息啦。然而，手裏拿着笨重而銹了的劈柴刀，在後門口劈着柴的阿瑛，剛好劈完最末一根柴時，她本能的把腰伸直了，仰臉呼着氣，她覺得這時非只腰痛，手痛而且很疲乏的了。　　但是，仍要打起這疲乏的精神把已劈好而堆在地上的柴一捆捆的搬到廚房裏去。整齊的安放在大灶的下面。　　像前二天，劈幾捆柴她是不覺得有什麼痛苦的，而且還很輕快的不一會兒便劈好了；但是她今天精神的這樣不濟事，因爲她今天的心是給另一種悲哀佔據着，丨一張五塊頭鈔票給失落掉了。　　丨一個月的工資呵！當發覺的時候她就悲哀的在肚裏這麼想着，現在仍是這麼想着，雖然，她懊悔工資要在十號才可以領，爲什麼在十號之前就向太太預支？到了十號才領不很好嗎？何必要這般心急呢？她不能再想下去了，可是，事實這一個月的工資她實不得不向太太預支的，於是，她便憶起昨天信裏丈夫的一段話丨　　「：：：年來鄕下没有好的收成，所以你就得别了我們奔進大都市里去替人家做女僕，這眞是没法兒呵！現在，各鄕村里的人家都是少一個人吃飯，好一個人，阿田我看很是懂事的了，於是，我便東託人家，西託人家，託了村口開豆腐店的洪福寳把他荐到鎭上去学習生意，洪福寳和我原有是交情的，所以一談他便答應，大約不出半月阿田就得要進店，可是，總得要做幾件布草換洗衣裳，望見信卽寄數元回家，：：：」　　她出神的還想把那封信的另一段想下去，驀的在她面前一個聲色俱厲的聲音駭破她出神的沉思，　　「阿瑛，做什麼還不快燒夜飯喲！天黑下來了啊」！　　她本能的把臉仰起來一瞧是太太，不覺機械的站了起來「唔」的應了一聲，但是，蘊藏着半天她眼眶裏的眼淚，突然的一顆顆的淌下來了，恰巧給太太一眼淸楚的瞥見，就像不快意的問道；　　「阿瑛！我問你，侈今天究竟爲着什麼事掛着哭喪臉？」　　「没有什麼事情，太太，是：：是：：」　　「是，是又是什麼是啊」？太太的臉色是沉了下來，逼緊着問。　　「是：：是我今天不留心把一張五元鈔票失落掉了」。　　聽得她這麼說着，太太輕輕的哼了一聲，接着便命令道；　　「快點燒飯了吧！等會少爺回家没有飯到嘴，當心又得挨罵了！」　　便若無其事似的走開去了，這在阿瑛的心靈上·是更加了一層悲哀，在她起先把這話講給太太聽的時候，原想太太或許同情她，哀憐她，而再預支給她一個月工資，却料不到太太會連一些表情也没有的若無其事的便走開去了，雖然她知道貧富階級本來是那樣的懸殊的，但她却不能不屈伏在這種處境下生活着，她想起她的丈夫，她的兒子阿田，在她眼前不覺是一片烏黑了。海員  一軍　　許多人對於海員都表示非常羨慕。以爲海員職業是很容易賺錢的，而且又能够周遊世界各國口岸，在生活上又是很有趣的。並且還有許多人願意投身當海員去，好呌自己發點洋財及嘗嘗這種有興趣的生活。　　實在，海員在表面上看來確實有點可觀。穿洋裝威風凜凜地，而且又能够說幾句洋話，　　　　，眞是可以同紳士，公子哥兒，　留學生比美！其嘗，這些都是撑門面的（海員的特性就是愛撑門面）。朋友，假如你眞實地去探討海員生活的內容，這種有興趣的生活，够你滋味啊！　　現在讓我來把海員生活簡單的叙述一下罷：　　這裏我所說的海員是工作於輪船上的生火夫，水手和侍仔。其餘船長，伙長，司機，買辦：：已不能稱作海員，而稱爲職員或技師了。　　海員所工作的船，大部分是外國船。是以香港上海兩埠爲最集中的。直到現在，海員的招雇，大部分還是握在包工制「涉孖沙」的手裏。所以海員要在船上找一個職位，復得請求「涉孖沙」。自然囉，「涉孖沙」便從中尅扣工資，作爲他介紹職業的酬勞（尅扣工資甚至有扣去三個月工資的）。雖然在香港方面還有許多間的「兄弟館」是和「涉孖沙」對抗的，可是因介紹職業力量的薄弱，而終歸失敗，因此祇有更加使「涉孖沙」力量的膨脤，更使「涉孖沙」的財源廣進。而海員則祇有俯首於「涉孖沙」淫威之下去過着遠涉重洋飄流的生涯，讓他剥削而已。　　海員一到了船上，船艙就是他們的故鄕，斗大鴿籠式的房間就是他們的唯一家庭。　　水手的工作從早晨就開始。洗甲板，磨艙面，上桅桿，擦銅，塗漆，拉纜：：所有一切艙面粗魯工夫。不管是狂風打浪，不管你有病無病，總之不停手地一直做到夜。　　生火夫，在烘烘的火艙裏，一剷二剷的煤炭送將爐裏去。熱，炙到皮膚發黑，使人熱到不能開口，甚至暈過去，幸得帆布風袋送來一陣陣的生風是一劑救命湯。四個鐘頭一更，做過一更又一更，有的確捱不起這種生活了，於是投身海裏，這事常有發生而且又是很平常。　　侍仔，人多稱作「僕歐」是船上客人和船長，伙長，技師：：的使喚人。早晨四點鐘就起床，淸洗「事頭」的房間，打掃，洗熨，鋪床，開餐：：總之侍候主人一切侍候侍候到晚上十二點鐘才可以安息，有時主人半夜還要呼喚。　　每天，到了晚上，工頭，那莫溫大多是「涉孖沙」親信卽大開賭博；牌九，麻雀，番攤：：應有盡有，並旦還開設多盞燈局（鴉片烟）吸引靑雲道友。工頭們就大發財源。假如伙計們不愛賭，也不抽鴉片，那麼下水船就遭開除了。　　說到海員的工資是很不一致的，如長江內河船祇有幾塊錢一個月的，有些外洋船員有三十多塊。但普通計來是最多二十塊左右。但是「涉孖沙」要扣去三四元，而且第一次下船的一個月工資都給他尅扣凈盡的。然而所謂「外塊」錢是不能有什麼希望的。「販黄魚」，走私漏稅，帶貨：：的「外水」收入，祇有工頭才有權做的。整個收入除了伙食和必需用品的消費外，眞是無法貯蓄幾塊錢，還能談到飬妻活兒麼？世界怪傑名言  潤鳳　　此次世界兩怪傑希特勒和墨索里尼，在威尼斯舉行重大會議後，希氏歸柏林途中，在吉拉地方演說，眞是名人名言，若但名言而不能實行，亦何足貴，希氏不但能言，而且能行，所以可貴，茲摘數語，我讀之，與閱者共讀之，更與負責當局共讀之。　　▲我人僅顧自强至某種程度，他國庶可放棄其侵略吾人之野心。　　▲全國志願之團結，較諸大砲與坦克車尤爲有力．　　▲吾人雖極願和平，德國雖極不原願有戰爭，但吾必竭力維護德國之自由與榮譽。　　▲外國人問德國將何所欲者，吾人將答以無論國內國外，吾德惟求旁人之不干涉。　　▲如有人詢予將何作爲，以謀世界之和平，吾將答以我輩訓練七千萬人民，使其自行尊重，並能尊重他人。　　▲吾德生存之權，决不容人置喙。　　▲各國政治家如能分其一部分對付國外之精力，從事改革內政，則世界之改善必非淺鮮。業餘信箱「答應她一個請求」的質疑（二）　　答：我很感謝李君提出不同的意見，並對於我給王君的答覆，盡情的指摘。我對於不論那種批評，對的或不對的，客觀的或主觀的，都不勝歡迎，爲的是可藉此機會將自己的見解再反省一次；自己有了錯誤，馬上改過，免得以後害人，不錯，更加强了自信。所以我對於李君的主張固未能同意，但他這種熱誠和善意，是十分致敬的。　　我上次所以勸王君漸與小姨冷淡而不贊成并娶二人，其最大原因就是要避免現實的痛苦。我一向答覆來詢者的問題，唯一的前提是顧慮到實際生活的情形，我是不拿個人的理想做解答問題的原則的，答覆王君當然也是如此了。就如一夫一妻制罷我也並不承認它是天經地義的制度，栢拉圖在共和國裏所主張的共妻制度，說得也是十分動聽。但是試問能否因此就主張共妻呢？不消說事實上是絕對不可能。所以你說的「多夫」「多妻」制度，在將來幾千百年的社會裏，也許是可行的。但我們所處的却是現社會，在這社會裏多夫多妻都不可行其理由不僅僅因多妻制度是「男性壓迫多數女性」（在一夫一妻制下一男壓迫一女我們也要反對）而要反對，愛情的獨占是誰也免不了的，王君和其小姨等都是要生存於現社會裏的人，那我怎好以未來社會的道理勸導之呢？理想中的大同世界是很快樂的，但我們把大同世界裏的快樂去勸導現社會裏苦悶悲愁着的人們，讓他們開懷，未免有點不入耳，李君思想是很前進的，但在這里却落於空想了。　　其次，李君說嫉妬是因女子經濟不能獨立，要倚仗男子，恐怕也未見其然。我們用男子來做例罷，二個男子愛上了一個女子，誰也不是爲着金錢，結果，却不惜掏出手鎗相見，這又是爲着什麼呢？所以經濟能獨立者也未必就不會嫉妬，不錯，嫉妬是佔有慾作祟，但，把「純潔的愛情」的佔有慾　　　　　是由於經濟和生活，未免有點祇看到枯木不看見森林，祇看到現象，不看見本</p>
<p>Page 21</p>
<p>質了。　　王君主動抑是小姨主動，我們是儘可不管的，「純潔的愛情」我們殊難斷定，卽令是的罷，然而根據這兩點，我們却不能勸王君同娶兩人。結婚一定要以戀愛爲基礎，但並不是說男女戀愛上了一定要無條件地，非結婚不可。李君據前者推論到後者，是犯了邏輯上的錯誤。我不贊同戀愛至上主義李君也未必主張。所以「純潔的愛情」，如因有更重於愛情者在而犧牲時，也不是薄情；以一人而鍾情二人，似也難說是「純潔」，保持與未婚妻的愛情的純潔，似乎與小姨的愛情就有點不純潔。　　說到小妻因失戀將終身不嫁，或非王君不嫁，這都是王君的過慮，如在編者身上的罪太重。這種特殊情形非突遇大激刺者不能發生。卽令突遇大刺激，如恩愛夫婦，丈夫突然去世，也不見得個個妻子要殉情。李君大槪祇看到中國寡婦的不嫁，而没有看到西洋寡婦的喜嫁，所以覺得婦女失戀，眞要闖大禍了。並且，我答王君時，也告他不可立時拒絕她，應當積極的介紹與消極的冷淡並進，我的原意是要她無形中把這事冷淡下去的。當然人是感情的動物，王君事實上做起來不免有點爲難，但如果决心已立，這種辦法也並不是不能辦的，辦不好的。　　總而言之，我的一切答案都是依照社會的環境，人類的常情，做不到的事；不合人情的事我是不說的。李君說我忽略特殊情形遵守一般的法則，我自己到現在還不能承認，到是覺得李君的立論有點過分崇拜抽象的原則而不從現實做出發點了。　　　　　　　編者自我職業介紹　　周元君，年三十五歲，皖中人，法政專門畢業，曾任中學國文史地敎員及報社編輯多年（均有證明文件）兼能辦各項公牘。無論私人，機關或律師事務所有需要者，請先投函上海晨報周璧山君收轉待遇方面：只期供結宿食及零用費。　　石君，江蘇籍，年二十二歲，中學　　，　　中英文，並能操國語，現項服務社會，月薪不計，如合則請書明職業類别，投函南市方浜路內松雪街成美里第八號張殿麟君收轉。　　季庵君，上海人，現年二十有七，大學畢業，曾任公司會計銀行職員學校敎員，現願担任商店職員學校或家庭敎員，如欲聘者請投函方浜橋明月坊五號金君轉。　　某女士，本地人，專科學校畢業，擅長音樂體育，富有敎育經騐，歷任中小校音體及初級級任敎師，現願任上項職務。欲聘者：請函江灣路上海法學院齋務科轉。張叔通先生作品  張叔通小說節母坊（八）　  淩鶴　　恰好母親自廚房中出來，聽見時敏的喊聲，少不了也來凑凑熱鬧，向那桶子裏望了一下。這使時敏高興得什麼似的，他扯着母親的衣角，大聲喊着說：　　「媽媽！你瞧，姑媽的大頭鬼輸了。」可是母親並不怎樣興奮，祇是懶懶看了一眼便跑開，似乎非常疲乏的坐在旁邊的竹椅子上，低聲的自語着：　　「懶向階前鬥蟋蟀，愁看膝下撫螟蛉！」　　「哎呀，瞧，大頭鬼的大腿也給咬斷了。哈哈哈：：：：：」　　時敏的呌喊，立刻將母親的吟哦聲掩蓋住了。在他的大笑之下，姑媽將負傷了的蟋蟀捉了起來。她心裏很難過，幾乎想把姪兒的蟋蟀摔死在地上才甘心。可是自己到底要裝出大姑娘的模樣，而且和姪兒計較更不體面，祇好極力遏止住心頭的憤怒，忿氣的將那蟋蟀丢向那走廊前面石花台中間的牡丹花叢裏面去了。　　可是同時在時敏的天眞的臉上，却有着掩不住的喜悅。他跳躍着將大戰之下的英雄，很珍重的關了起來之後，再走過來依在母親的懷裏，他向母親誇耀着：　　「媽媽，不是眞的做到了，我說過我要捉一個咬死她的大頭鬼的。」　　「哼，讀書就不肯用功，一天到晚捉蟋蟀，假使你讀書肯這樣認眞那才好哩。　　母親說話，有的時候老是這樣慢呑呑的，這不知道是什麼原故。她靜靜的坐着，看上去似乎在想着心事。可是六歲的孩並不會關心這些，而且他也不懂得這些。他手摸着母親高聳的肚皮，因爲他已經知道在她的肚皮內又有了小弟弟，這是姑媽告訴他的，在他的小上眼睛中發出親切的光輝。　　母親靜靜的想着，神秘的微笑，輕妙的盡在她的嘴唇邊。她的手觸着孩子的前額，整理着他那散亂的頭髮。一種親切的情愛，在母子之間無聲的流通，潔凈的，也是偉大的。時敏無力的倚偎着母親的腿，他看見姑媽已經悄悄的走開了，勝利的驕傲又使他扯開小嘴微笑。當他再回轉頭來的時候，他聽見母親在說：　　「你知道麼？你和宣統皇帝同年哩。可是宣統三歲就做皇帝，現在六歲就，現掌管天下大事，你却天天蟋蟀捉，跟人家淘氣，不害羞麼？」</p>

<p>電影專刊中華民國貳拾参年陸月貳拾貳日星期伍男子做了影戲女人去看（中）  密齊男權盛張之時實况一斑　女子所佔地位微乎其微　　蓓絲是位有心人，她將攝影塲中重要工作人員等等，逐一的問下去，佈景師，攝影師，燈洶師，技術師，等等。可是她很失望地發見了各攝影塲中工作的全是男人。除掉女演員之外，竟没有一個女子佔據重要的工作地位。甚至於裁衣師，化妝師等，平常人以爲女子所優爲的事情，亦都是男子做的。霍金絲女士，考爾白女士，黛德麗許女士等的衣服，統通是男子裁製的。有人說女子喜歡穿男人裁製的衣服，因爲男子替女人裁製衣服，一定是合乎男子的心理的。女子的衣著入時，不多是爲男子們看的嗎？可是亦有人說，女子穿衣服，是給女子們看的。這理且不用辯駁，而好萊塢各公司的裁衣師都是男人，確是事實。　　好萊塢攝影塲中，上下一切工作，統通是男人做的，連女演員的化妝，梳頭，都要假手於男子。華納公司有十六個理髮師，六個化妝師，可是他們都是男人，没有一個女子。蓓絲聽了這種情形，有些急了。她問道：「那末在影戲製作的事務方面，到底有女子的份兒没有呢？」喬治思索了半天說道：「有。在米曲羅公司裏有位勃克諾爾女士，是專作研究工作的。在狐狸公司裏，有一位考夫門女士是衣裝部的主任。其餘的，剪片員，記録員，書記。以及打字員，女堂倌等，各公司的女職員亦很多。」　　蓓絲心想，原來不過如此。她想起女子在其他各種郚業中，佔有重要地位的很多。嵼行界中有亞梅利亞衣爾哈德。林白大尉夫人，亦曾和她的丈夫並駕齊驅過。海倫威爾斯和傑何白女士是綱球塲上的女盟主。柏金斯女士亦曾作過國務會議的主席。著作界有誰：：：女游泳家，女探險家，女傳道師，以及海洋裏没水的者有著名的女子。惟獨在電影界没有！　　再論到女明星們，她們在電影界的地位，尤可令人歎息。她們和影片製作的關係，可以說，猶之蠟像和商店的櫥窗相等。她們的踏進影界，亦都男子們親手挑選的，無論他是排戲的導演，或是局部的製作者，或是其他有勢力的高級職員。至於明星們本身，她們是没有發言的地位的。她們在默片時代，是没有聲音的，但是到了有聲時代，她們除了　就的對白和歌唱之外，亦是照樣没有聲音的，而歌唱對白，亦都男子們替她們編好的。　　當然，好萊塢亦有幾個女著作家，她們的電影脚本曾經被公司當局採用的。但是那都是稀有的盛事。照平常的事實而論，一個影戲的攝製，先由一個造意人（Ｇagman），没有聽見造意女人（Ｇagwoman）想到了一個好主意，去告訴一個著作家（男子；）由著作家編成了故事，送給製作家（男子；）製作家看了，送給一個導演（男子；）那個導演將那故事送給編脚本人（Ｃontinujiy　Wri）ter,男子；）他編好了脚本，又送給寫對白的人（Ｄialogue　writer,男子；）他寫好了又送還給導演，作爲攝影時的台本。拍片子的時候，攝影師是男子；編輯是男子；公司理的發行者是男子；經租片子的亦是男子。但是到了戲院裏放映的時候，你看一看在座的觀衆，却大多是女子。據確實的統計，觀衆之中，女子佔有全部百分之八十一零七，就是百分之八十二。所以說，影戲是完全男子製造的娛樂品，而看客則大半是女子。這不是件很奇怪的事嗎？（未完）影片談評「情人職業化」  評憶君　　Ｐrofessional　Sweetheart　　丨南京映丨　　並不如我的理想中那般描寫男女戀愛的職業化，用物質來買賣愛情，但是「情人職業化」可以說是比一般胡鬧的片子來得高明一些了，雖然在這裏也有很多無聊的滑稽。　　「情人職業化」叙述一個播音的歌女因爲需要異性的伴侶而不安於職，毁棄了合同，於是播音公司的商人磋商了一個辦法，替她選擇了一個理想中的情人，終於他滿足了她，在一個荒僻的鄕村中同居了。但他倆靜極思動，在最後便重行簽訂了合同，一對愛人重又同來播音了。　　就故事而論，還是那麼千篇一律的描寫男女的戀愛，在最後還是那麼千篇一律的來上一個Ｈappyending。然而，在「情人職業化」裏所描寫的商人的醜態，簽訂了合同以後就會失去了自由，没有了Ｍovalitr,以及約翰在荒僻的鄕居裏對他妻子說看看你的手，是那般柔軟，一點也不起鄒爾，不去做工作，只是吸烟，渴酒：：：：：：你眞是一個壞女人！」就是這些極輕微的諷刺，算是「情人職業化」稍微可看的地方。　　此外，除了這些，在「情人職業化」裏再也找不出什麼了，假如還有的話，那末至多是用播音的歌女的戀愛來作題材的新鮮而已。　　導演的手法很簡潔，有幾處化入都是很可取的，如開頭的從無綫電話化到播音等，至如在約翰與格蘿莉駕汽車出發下鄕時的幾個廻旋鏡頭（Ｐ、Ｓ。）也很聰敏的。　　但是，「情人職業化」的故事的一貫的平坦，没有高潮，没有刺戟，再加以冗繁的對白，過多的電話和播音，導演手法的經濟，琴逑羅吉斯的歌唱，以及幾個滑稽明星的滑稽，也不能减少觀衆的厭倦沉悶的感覺。　　琴逑羅吉絲在這裏演得很成功，那種天眞的，爛漫的姿態，眞有些麗琳哈蕙化了，飾約翰的瑙門福斯脫却是平凡而已。評「」花影繽紛  巴黎　　Ｔhe　shoepolish　king　　大槪是在三個月以前，國泰大戲院，曾經開映過一部譯名爲「街頭天使」的法國影片。在那影片中，劇作者使一街頭流浪者，因偶然的機會，混入了高貴的人們之羣，十足的盡了小丑的任務，使紳士太太們大笑大樂。到後來那流浪人更偶然的發了財，在姻緣美滿之後，他已經由流浪人而變爲紳士了。　　現在這「花影繽紛」差不多是「街頭天使」的改頭換面。這不僅是監製者或主演者同是一人，而故事的內容，也大致相似。和「街頭天使」一樣，這裏主角的名字也呌鮑博。他在車站給從們擦皮鞋爲職業，後來成爲公共汽車的車夫。因一偶然的機會，他到那極華麗的戲院中去看戲。又偶然的被人們目爲王子，而和一名伶來往。更在上層社會中，大鬧一番。又偶然的她贏了許多錢。於是又和「街頭天使」一樣，和他的愛人結婚團圓。　　很顯然的，劇作者是以不丑的身份，在高貴的人羣中，大鬧大喊，表現其譏笑諷刺之用意。出身低微的人，他不懂得紳士淑女們之禮貌，他只隨性之所欲，爲所欲爲。他打太太們的屁股，他撕破夫人們的內衣，但是人們都以爲他是快樂之神，並且因着他的侮辱而歡喜，於是他是盡了小丑之職務，他使紳士淑女們快樂，也是自己快樂，所以他終於爬上了高等社會，到底獲得了圓滿而快樂的結果。我們不能以爲這是進步的作品，編劇者是狂歡的不顧一切的快樂，甚至於他自己所屬的階層之生活的燦爛，他也感覺不到低度的悲哀。但是現在還容許藝術作品之太平盛世的歌頌麼？偉大而具有正確世界觀的藝術家，是不能如此自欺欺人，掩飾現實的。　　在技術方面，我想又將有軟性的人們，認爲偉大的作品，因爲它有幽默的笑料，也有滑稽，很適合他們批評影片的尺度。他們的格言是影片不談意識，尤其是喜劇祇要有「輕鬆，幽默，便是一等的片子。但是我們却以爲這」擦皮鞋大王」是没有多大價値的，不管他略有譏諷之筆調。　　另一方面說，假使以這「花影繽紛」和「街頭天使」比較一下的話，那末很顯然前者是不及後者的了。「街頭天使」有着非常明快而瀟灑的作風，快Ｔempo的旋律，快樂的歌聲音，很可以顯出導演者有着獨特的技巧，他自始至終，不使觀衆感覺絲毫沉悶。而這一「花影繽紛」，我們承認導演對於舞台的塲面，確實是費力不少，但是對於其他各點，如「街頭天使」的長處，在這裏是不能全部找着的。尤其是特别過火的地方，更加使人厭煩。　　喬其曼爾唐是一個天才的喜劇家吧。他有着優良的技能，尤其是他的唱歌，更使人快感。但是，他還没有達到爐火純靑的地步，他有許多過火的誇張，和導演一樣，將好萊塢所用慣了的喜劇資料，在這裏不厭煩的使用，而成爲他演技上的缺憾。姊妹花有續集的必要  如來生　　國產片中之「姊妹花」能獨創驚人紀録，爲一般人百觀不厭，稱道勿衰者，自有其特異之點存在。而鄭正秋之導演尤能予人以深刻之剌激，打動觀衆們之心弦。然苟非胡蝶飾要角，則亦難以有警透而細膩的表演。兩難相並，自是傑構。不過以鄙之見，此片買座旣如是之盛，應有續集之作，否則大寳與其母之得救仍依劍英之力。劍英雖曾被大寳所感動，然劍英究這樣地發現天良以還淸白，且母子三人同時而逝。究往何處？此皆一般觀衆所急欲知者。劍英依錢勢，雖未有爲非作惡之事跡，然而仗勢凌人，貧窮之親姊已實受其侮　。目下旣已悔悟，應有實際上之表示。所以鄙意以爲「姊妹花」應有續集之開拍也。「萬花團」攝成影片  小番　　前在本埠卡爾登表演之「萬花歌舞團，」在該院表演時，極爲中外人仕所激賞，而售價最高達六元之鉅。天一公司因慕該團藝術高超，商得該團領班馬嘉士之同意，將該團節目中之最精彩節目攝成爲有聲電影，同時；天一女明星葉秋心范雪朋王慧娟陸麗霞等亦在該片中客串表演。此片現已獲得電影檢查會通過，將繼「王先生」後公映於北京大戲院云。電影小說氤氳使者（Ｗhere　Sinners　Meet)(一)  梅聖　　美國亞爾開歐雷電華出品丨狄亞娜溫嫋等主演　　安妮安想這件事眞有些蹊蹺，她和里昂那的私奔，會中途而止的。他們是預先計劃定的，一同渡過英倫海峽到法國去，可是在未到杜佛半途之中，忽然汽車壞了。里昂那的汽車夫桑德斯建議，他認識一個「客店似的」地方，可以暫時安居。安妮和里昂那心中雖不願意，可是天色昏黄，進退兩難，祇好跟着桑德斯去了。安妮尤其是覺得懊惱。她在英國境內，是不願意和里昂那同居丨丨况且他是個有婦之夫。這簡直使一切的一切更形複雜，變成了無聊的僵局。要是他們能按照預定的計劃，當夜渡海去到法國：：：她開始漸漸疑心到里昂那的辦事能力了，在那萬分懊惱之中。　　他們來到了「客店」，很奇怪的，好像那裏早已知道他們要蒞臨似的。晚飯已經預備好了，佈置三個坐位丨還有一個不速之主人，他自己介紹了自己，說是呌拉鐵墨先生，他並且不顧里昂那的反對，硬稱呼著他的第一個名字。他們吃飯的時候，拉鐵墨自己講出他是一個很富有的人。他並且說有錢不一定有權威，可是却有些勢力。因爲他的奇想驅使他利用他的金錢，濫用他的勢力，可是却是爲圖他人的利益。並且他因爲有了全，他就很容易地聽見他人所不易聽得的消息。這次，他聽說有男女二人在冒險的婚姻途中，他就施了一些小機巧，要將他們躭擱幾天，讓他們在淸醒的時候，决定了他們以後是否是能够永久快樂同居的。　　這壓根兒是件荒唐不可信的事，將一封私奔的情人軟禁了幾天。可是現在，經過幾天强迫的考慮：幾天方中在像拉鐵墨那種人物的比較光綫之下，看着里昂那；在那種他無法控制的境地之中，她竟自己疑心到她從前怎麼會和里昂那私奔出來的。當然，這件事的起源，她是記得的。拉鐵墨呢，他似乎也有他神秘的方法，知道這件事的原委：：：她是一個居住在閉關寂寞中的女子，她惟一的伴侶，是她的老父，而她的老父，又是一位勤於工作，不計家事的人。因此她對於外界，對於生活，是茫無所知的。忽然間她遇到了這位里昂那。她眞是感激極了，因爲里昂那稱讚她一兩句好話的緣故。她覺得她自己已經愛上了他丨丨太晚了，等到她發現他是個有家室的人。她思想紊亂了，主意完全喪失了。加以里昂那是個巧言令色的人，他告訴她說他的老婆育妲西亞，不久就要和他離婚的，到那個時候再成婚好了。如此這般一來，一個涉世未深的女子，就同意了出奔丨丨不想在未到杜佛的半途中又生了問題。那時安妮還以爲明天一早，仍舊可以繼續前進的，不管拉鐵墨阻擋不阻擋。不想里昂那，大槪亦是中了拉鐵墨的詭計，或者是他僕役輩的作弄，里昂那一夜傷起風來。安妮未免有些生氣，可是里昂那竟生病了，他自怨自艾着他不肯去了丨這個當然亦是拉鐵墨所情願的。安妮心裏恨恨地罵着；「里昂那這種人，自己甘心情願受了拉鐵墨的愚弄，侮辱，還不想離開那個地方！」（未完）</p>

<h3>False Police at Nantianmen Have Not Yet Withdrawn Outside the Pass</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The false police at Nantianmen withdrew to the false National Highway Bureau north of Gubeikou North Pass a few days ago, but they are still staying there and have not withdrawn outside the pass. It is said that this is because the barracks of the Bashke Battalion have not yet been completed, so they are waiting for a few days. After the Gubeikou Office urged the Japanese side, the other party replied that they would withdraw outside the pass by the end of this month. At the same time, the false police headquarters and the false police chief Hong Lu also moved to the Bashke Battalion. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<h3>China and Japan Periodically Announce the Beiping-Shenyang Through Train Plan; Order Issues on the Train to be Decided at the Beidaihe Meeting; Service Personnel Assigned and Tickets in Printing; Yin Tong Reportedly to Issue Declaration When the Through Train is Realized</h3>
<h3>Japanese Side Denies the Abolition of the Tanggu Agreement</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Beiping-Shenyang through train plan is scheduled to be announced on the 28th of this month. The time for the Chinese side is 9:00 AM, and the time for the Japanese side is 11:00 AM. The announcement locations are Beiping for the Chinese side and Japan for the Japanese side. Regarding the issue of the establishment of the Sino-Japanese International Travel Agency, the China Travel Service has expressed its acceptance of the commission from the Ministry of Railways. The manager of the company, Chen Xiangtao, will arrive in Tianjin in the near future. It is reported that after the Beiping-Shenyang through train is implemented, it will actually be the same as the current joint through train situation. Passengers still have to get off the train when passing through Shanhaiguan, and go through inspection to prevent the smuggling of goods or drugs into the pass. The complexity is no different from passengers changing trains. It is rumored that Yin Tong will issue a declaration when the through train is realized, but it must be approved by the authorities. The detailed rules for the through train have been printed into booklets by the Beining Railway and distributed to the staff for reference. In addition to establishing agencies in Shanhaiguan, Tianjin, and Shenyang, the International Travel Agency will not set up offices at other stations along the line to save expenses. After the through train issue is resolved smoothly, it is heard that issues such as through mail and establishment of groups will also be resolved accordingly. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Tong said that he visited He yesterday to report on the progress of this trip. The Tianjin meeting only discussed how to organize the Sino-Japanese Travel Agency, because all matters had already been prepared by the Railway Bureau. He himself is scheduled to visit Chai Shan tomorrow. The war zone negotiations can only have considerable development after Huang returns to Beiping. He plans to stay in Beiping for about three days. After finishing the matter, he will return to Tianjin. The date of the through train will be determined after the plan is announced. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The original text of the through train plan has a total of ten items, and 500 copies each of the through train details are printed. The implementation date of the through train is set for July 1. At that time, Beiping and Shenyang stations will run in opposite directions to each other. The service personnel on the train have been assigned by the Railway Bureau. The tickets used have been printed since last week. First class is pink, second class is white, and third class is blue. Two sets of Beining Railway passenger cars have been manufactured at the Tangshan factory. There are no symbols on the locomotives and passenger cars. The passenger cars are light gray. Everything has been prepared, and it will be implemented as soon as the bureau's order is received. The China Travel Service and the Japan International Tourist Bureau decided to hold a meeting in Tianjin. Yin Tong received a telegram from Chen Xiangtao, saying that the Travel Agency decided to accept the commission from the Ministry of Railways to handle the ticketing for the Beiping-Shenyang through train, and scheduled a meeting of all directors on the 22nd. After the meeting, Chen will leave Shanghai for Tianjin. The representative of the Japan International Tourist Bureau, Suzuki, is also scheduled to arrive in Tianjin within a few days to participate in the meeting. After the through train is implemented, both parties will organize a train police team on the train. The uniform is slightly different from ordinary railway police. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the Sino-Japanese Travel Agency implements the through train, the purchase of train tickets will be handled in accordance with the normal procedures of the Travel Agency. The entire line is divided into eight major stations, namely Tianjin, Tangshan, Changli, Shanhaiguan, Jinzhou, Goubangzi, and Xinmintun. Each station has a branch office. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Chen Xiangtao, manager of the China Travel Service, can take a plane to Tianjin on the 22nd. Zhou Shizhong, deputy manager of the company, has already arrived in Tianjin tonight to wait, but he claims to be ill to the outside world and refuses to see anyone. Here on the 22nd, Chen Xiangtao, Xu Wenguo, deputy director of the Beining Railway, and Zheng Baozhao will be the center of a small group meeting on through trains. Zheng Baozhao was ordered by Yin Tong to go to Beidaihe with Chen Qingwen, director of the Machinery Department of the Bureau, to rush back to Tianjin. After the Tianjin meeting, they will go to Beidaihe to meet with Japanese representatives. Today, I went to the Japanese National Defense Tourist Bureau in Tianjin to inquire about the exact date of the through train. According to them, if no problems occur on July 1, it can be realized. The ticket price is slightly lower than the current joint ticket price. The current joint ticket price from Beiping to Shanhaiguan and from Shanhaiguan to Shenyang is 11 yuan, 3 jiao and 5 fen for a third-class seat.</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to foreign news, the Tianjin China Travel Service and the Beining Railway Bureau have prepared a schedule for the through train outside the pass, but after inquiring from both parties, this is not the case. It is heard that the through train tickets are indeed being printed by the Beining Railway. However, the maintenance of order on the train after the through train and the exchange of account books still need to be studied at the Beidaihe meeting. Today, Chinese and foreign people went to the Japanese National Defense Tourist Bureau and the China Travel Service to inquire about the through train news, but they could not get the actual situation. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Xiangtao, general manager of the China Travel Service, was summoned north to discuss the through train organization issue. Chen came to Nanjing from Shanghai on the 21st and took the Shanghai-Beiping through train north that night. When passing through Beijing, he visited the relevant authorities, President Wang and Minister Gu, and received some instructions. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The principle of our government on the through train issue is not to recognize the puppet Manchuria. All methods and technical procedures have been made concrete. The agency responsible for the through train will be undertaken by the International Travel Agency jointly formed by the China Travel Service and the Japanese Tourist Bureau. However, the detailed rules of the through train, such as the distribution of security, ticketing, and vehicles, still need to be approved by the competent authorities. As for the letter of entrustment of the China Travel Service, it is heard that it is handled by the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Railways. The Business Department only takes into account the issue of vehicle distribution after the through train. The initial realization is that there is one round-trip passenger train between Shenyang and Tianjin every day. The issue of freight trains has not been agreed upon. The claim of realization on July 1 is the hope of the Japanese side. The Chinese side must make a decision after everything is complete before it can be realized. In addition, Yin Tong telegraphed Beijing today to report that if the Beining Railway has completed the preparations for this security procedure, it may be realized. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The "East Daily" reported that the Chinese side expects that the Sino-Japanese parties will publicly announce the through train and through mail measures on the 28th of this month, and will start operating on July 1. It is also reported that the Tanggu Agreement will be abolished at the same time. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that this is only the hope of the Chinese side, and there has been no formal proposal. However, even if there is a proposal, the Japanese side will definitely not agree. The Ministry of the Army also said that it has not received any reports. (Hua Lian telegram on the 21st)</p>

British Consul Jude Rui went to Zhaohua today with Chai Chunlin, director of the Ship Affairs Tax Police Bureau, to investigate. The British Embassy ordered the British Deputy Consul Diaoru Le in Jinan to handle the case. Han hosted a banquet for Diao today, and Diao asked Han to rescue him quickly. Han replied that he had ordered the military and police to strictly arrest them. If they were in the province, there would be news within a week. Diao was very satisfied. A detective team of 40 people went to the coast today to search. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs telegraphed the provincial government to rescue them quickly. Japanese Consul Nishida also visited Han today to ask for rescue. (Special dispatch on the 21st)</p>

The army, navy and air force are now doing their best to search for the remaining kidnapped passengers. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The five British people who were kidnapped on the Shuntian steamer have regained their freedom. The five people are now taking a British warship to Weihaiwei. A Chinese person who was released by the pirates at the same time as Nichol was also rescued. It is generally believed that the pirates resolutely released the five British people because the Chinese army began to surround them. Yesterday, airplanes carried out strict reconnaissance on the coast and discovered a team of people whose actions were suspicious. There seemed to be traces of Europeans in the team. The airplanes immediately pursued them and did not stop until sunset. In the afternoon, Nichol and a Chinese person were sent to a sampan near the mouth of the Yellow River. The sampan was floating on the sea. It is generally believed that the pirates' intention to release the two people was to start ransom negotiations. Also, at around 6:30 PM in the afternoon, the other four kidnapped British people were also released and sent to the sampan, but the details are still unknown. They were rescued immediately. It is heard that the pirates gave Nichol a letter to be forwarded to the British Consul in Jinan. The letter was written in Chinese and has not yet been translated, but it is heard that the pirates stated in the letter that they are not hostile to the British government, and they do not want to redeem tickets with money, but only to avoid prosecution. It seems that they hope that the British Consul will come forward to prevent Han Fuqu from sending troops to encircle and suppress them. According to news from Jinan Prefecture, the army has already surrounded the pirates and is gradually tightening the encirclement. Now the pirates have no way to escape and will eventually be captured. Today, a Reuters interviewer visited British Ambassador Jaddigan. According to him, the efforts of the Chinese central and local governments to rescue the kidnapped people and suppress the pirates are deeply gratifying. As for the whereabouts of the Japanese Yamamoto, there is still no news. (Reuters dispatch on the 20th)</p>

<h3>Germany Suspends Payment of Foreign Debt</h3>
<p>By Jing</p>
<p>According to Reuters, the German government announced on the 14th of this month that it would postpone the payment of German foreign debt for six months from July 1 of this year, including the Dawes and Young loans. After the announcement was released, public opinion in London, Paris, and New York was in an uproar. Many governments have raised serious protests. In the UK, financiers and industrialists have taken separate paths due to different interests. However, Chancellor Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons on the 15th that if Germany does not have a way to satisfy British bondholders by July 1, the UK will not hesitate to apply the exchange clearing system between London and Berlin. After Chamberlain's speech, the British cabinet unanimously passed a protest note to Germany on the 19th regarding the deferred payment of foreign debt. This alone is enough to speculate on the future development of the matter, which may affect the European political situation and make today's disputes more severe.</p>
<p>Since Germany's defeat in the European War, its compensation to the strong powers such as Britain and France has been enormous. However, without the loans provided by the victorious countries, the ability to compensate would not have been able to continue. The labor production of the people would not have been able to proceed. As the most developed industrial country in the world, Germany bears the world's largest foreign debt (estimated at approximately 15 billion marks in principal and interest as of the end of September 1933, with annual external expenditures of 1 billion marks). The burden of compensation is undoubtedly the main reason. The increased expenditures and trade deficits in recent years have made Germany's long-term economic panic even more severe.</p>
<p>Now, let's look at Germany's central finances. In the past three years, the Berlin government has spent approximately 500 million marks more than it has received each year. This year's budget is nearly 500 million marks more than last year's, totaling 6.5 billion marks. Among them, the increase in military spending is particularly large. This is the first financial difficulty. Secondly, in terms of trade, according to the report of the German Central Bank, the bank's reserves of gold and foreign exchange have undergone the following changes compared to a year ago:</p>
<p>May 6, Last Year</p>
<p>Gold 401 million marks 184 million marks</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange 99 million marks 7 million marks</p>
<p>Reserve Ratio 9.1% 5.4%</p>
<p>The decline in gold and foreign exchange is sufficient to explain the increasingly difficult external payments, and the sharp drop in exports and slow sales of goods are also the reasons for the outflow of gold. This is the second trade difficulty.</p>
<p>Attacked by the above-mentioned factors, Germany cannot but take the final step of suspending compensation payments. If the countries of Britain and France must force payment, even if they do not repeat the mistake of the French-Belgian coalition forces occupying the Ruhr, the market war that will occur as a result may be unavoidable. At that time, Britain can intercept Germany's export payments, and Germany may not be able to block the market for retaliation. If both sides go to extremes and cut off trade relations, the state of a self-sufficient society will inevitably make both sides suffer.</p>
<p>The suspension of foreign debt payments has become a common phenomenon in recent years. Countries such as Britain, France, Italy, Belgium, and South America have already had precedents. It did not originate in Germany. In the future, the economic panic will be even worse, and there will be more suspensions. The impact is not only the shock of the foreign debt credit of the countries involved. Given the close international economic relations today, it can often affect the whole body with a single hair. It is up to politicians with great foresight to understand the situation in depth, make decisive decisions, and consider accommodations to allow the vitality to recover slightly. Otherwise, draining the pond to catch all the fish is not the act of wisdom.</p>

<h3>Preliminary Naval Talks: Anglo-American-Japanese Triangular Struggle; US Believes Japan's Reasons for Equality Insufficient; Japanese Ambassador Matsudaira Appears Uneasy Upon Hearing News</h3>
<p>(London) A political reporter for the Daily Telegraph stated today that the situation of the naval talks is not optimistic. To obtain a larger navy, Britain wants new battleships and more cruisers, while the United States seems unwilling to consider the request. Japan is now preparing to make a request for freedom of action in the Chinese seas and the western Pacific. If so, the naval conference will be cancelled before it even begins. (21st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Today, the naval community here is discussing Japan's demand that the 5:5:3 ratio of the Washington Naval Treaty be revised. A spokesman for the Japanese Ministry of the Navy issued this demand today, claiming that it is a mistake to say that Japan cannot compete with other countries in shipbuilding due to financial reasons. American naval figures in London criticized Tokyo's remarks, saying that Japan's reasons are not strong enough and must provide more compelling reasons to support its request before it can be discussed. British officials believe that Tokyo has now raised a question that is more important to the United States than to Britain. If Japan demands equality, what attitude will Britain take? It is impossible to predict today. Former Chief of Naval Tactics, General Pratt, recently published an article in a foreign affairs magazine criticizing Japan's demand for naval equality. In the eyes of Londoners, this article can be seen as an accurate reflection of the general sentiment in Washington regarding the American policy in the 1925 naval conference. It is generally believed that what General Pratt said is exactly what the British and American representatives participating in the current preliminary naval talks want to say regarding Japan's request to abolish the ratio principle. The Japanese Embassy in London has received the gist of General Pratt's remarks from Washington. Therefore, Japanese Ambassador Matsudaira and his naval advisor feel quite uneasy today. It is reported that they seem to believe that Britain and the United States are now in the same boat, preventing the failure of the naval conference.</p>
<h3>Content of Continued Anglo-American Talks</h3>
<p>Today, representatives from both the United Kingdom and the United States continued naval talks at 10 Downing Street. British Prime Minister MacDonald elaborated on Britain's responsibilities around the world and the need for a sufficient fleet to fulfill those responsibilities. Those present from the United States were Davis, Bingham, Rice, and Atherton. Those present from the United Kingdom were Prime Minister MacDonald, Secretary of the Navy Monsell, Liddell, and Craigie. Only the British Prime Minister spoke today. After the British Prime Minister finished speaking, the representatives felt that his remarks implied that Britain wanted to take the lead in the next round of negotiations. What the British Prime Minister said today were all well-known points, nothing more than stating that Britain absolutely relied on the supply of food and raw materials from overseas and that Britain had political responsibilities and obligations in various parts of the world, especially in British autonomous regions on both sides of the Pacific. The British Prime Minister also spoke of Britain's position in India, its commercial relations with Japan, China, and other countries in Asia, and the future of completing the Singapore naval base. The British Prime Minister also mentioned the uncertain situation Britain faced in the Mediterranean naval issue arising from the stalemate between France and Italy. The British Prime Minister's remarks probably indicated that Britain wanted the freedom to increase its cruiser tonnage. According to the naval treaty nine years ago, the number of cruisers, including large and small cruisers, was limited to 339,000 tons. (20th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Representatives of the United Kingdom and the United States are holding preliminary naval talks here. They do not seem to have studied the procedures to be adopted at the future naval conference in detail. It is reported that the British side only made a broad statement on the country's naval policy. The Anglo-American experts, who are to meet tomorrow, have only received general instructions regarding the working guidelines and no other more detailed instructions. A certain newspaper reported this morning that during the Anglo-American talks, the American representatives will mention the issue of the Philippine Islands in addition to purely technical issues at the naval conference. The United States is quite concerned about the fate of the Philippines after independence and therefore wants the United Kingdom and Japan to issue a declaration guaranteeing the neutrality of the Philippine Islands. According to well-informed sources, it is not impossible for the American representatives to raise this issue during their stay in London. As for how the British side will accept this proposal, their attitude is roughly as follows: Britain agrees to jointly issue a declaration with other countries to guarantee the neutrality of the Philippines, but will refuse to impose sanctions on those who violate the declaration. The maximum obligation that Britain can assume in this regard is to acknowledge mutual consultation with the countries concerned. (21st Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Anglo-American naval experts met for two hours today. It is reported that the British experts have expressed their views on technical issues, and the American representatives will also express their views, and then a general discussion will be held. According to sources close to the American representatives, the United States, in view of the negative sentiments around the world arising from the failure of the World Economic Conference, is unwilling to join any new conference without a good prospect of success. If the current discussions reveal excessive differences, the United States may feel that it is better to postpone the conference indefinitely. (21st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) British and American naval experts held their first meeting this morning at the Foreign Office. The American representatives present were Rear Admiral Rice and Atherton, Counselor of the American Embassy in the United Kingdom.

<p>to establish an agreement with the United Kingdom and the United States that the world's major oceans are now divided into several spheres of influence. Each country has the responsibility to maintain peace and enjoy this right within its sphere of influence. The true meaning of Japan's plan is to obtain the right to act freely in China and the western Pacific. If all countries can agree to this, then Japan will not insist on naval equality and can slightly modify the original naval ratio, that is, change 5:5:3 to 5:5:4. If all countries cannot satisfy Japan with the sphere of influence, then Japan will insist on naval equality. However, in general, the threats to the success of the naval conference are not limited to Japan's demands. The intentions of the United Kingdom are also worrying. Britain has two demands: one is to increase the number of cruisers, and the other is to rebuild other warships. Therefore, both of these are enough to shake the naval conference. The newspaper concludes that, in general, the naval conference is in the following form: Japan demands a stronger navy, Britain demands to build new ships, and the United States is hesitant. All of these are not good signs. (21st Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Britain Agrees Not to Discuss Politics</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government issued a reply on May 17 to Britain's invitation to convene the Tenth Naval Conference, stating that Japan believes the next conference should focus on purely technical issues of naval forces and absolutely opposes touching on any political issues. It is reported that when Ambassador Matsudaira met with British Prime Minister MacDonald on the 18th, he inquired about Britain's attitude towards this Japanese policy. Prime Minister MacDonald also expressed his agreement. Thus, the political issues most concerned by the Japanese government were excluded, and the preliminary consultations will focus on procedural issues such as reducing the caliber of guns and types of ships, and other technical issues. (21st United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a telegram today from Ambassador Matsudaira regarding his meeting with American representative Davis on the 19th. However, its contents have not been disclosed and cannot be known. According to other sources, Davis told Matsudaira regarding the location and timing of the arms reduction conference that the United States did not oppose holding the conference in London, but because the US Congress will open early next year, he hoped that the conference could be held in May or June. The two exchanged views on general issues but did not discuss specific issues. (21st United Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>US-Japan Political Talks</h3>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull held talks with Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito today on general issues between the United States and Japan. The talks lasted one hour. Counselor Inouye of the Japanese Embassy was also present. Afterwards, Saito declared that what he discussed with Hull were general political and commercial issues and did not involve naval issues, because he had not received any instructions from the Tokyo government. Saito is now scheduled to depart from San Francisco for home on the 3rd of next month. During his absence, the embassy's affairs will be handled by Counselor Fujii. (20th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Italian-French Shipbuilding Competition</h3>
<p>(Paris) According to a report in the News, Italy has recently decided to build two battleships with a displacement of 35,000 tons each. The News believes that this is a response to France's construction of the Dunkerque battleship. The newspaper further claims that the construction of the French Dunkerque battleship is now not only surpassed by Italy's new construction, but the Dunkerque is already useless even before it enters the water. Therefore, this is a most regrettable matter, and Mussolini's signing of the construction contract is tantamount to Italy's great victory at sea. Now Italy is using the international naval agreement to expand its power. We (the French) can only watch its failure. (20th National Telegraph dispatch)</p>
<h3>British-Dutch Secret Agreement: Britain Denies Japanese Rumors</h3>
<p>(London) Reuters today reported, according to responsible sources, that the claim in Japanese newspapers that Britain and the Netherlands have reached a secret agreement to take a common stance on military and economic matters in the Far East is unfounded. Furthermore, the claim that the Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in Malaya will soon go to the Netherlands is also unfounded. (20th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>US Fleet to Return to the Pacific in November: Large-Scale Exercises in the South Atlantic in Mid-September for Six Weeks</h3>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of the Navy Swanson announced today that the U.S. Fleet will be transferred back to the Pacific for long-term stationing on October 1st. Before sailing back to the Pacific, the entire fleet will sail to Guantanamo Bay on September 17th for large-scale exercises. The exercises are scheduled for six weeks, and then they will use the fastest possible method to pass through the Panama Canal and return to the Pacific. Swanson said that previously, on April 24th and 25th, 88 warships passed through the Panama Canal in just 47 hours, and now they plan to increase the speed again. The Navy Department believes that the plan to pass through the canal should be based on the entire fleet as the original position, and they are willing to make a daring attempt. According to calculations by naval authorities, the cost of the fleet's return to the Pacific, including fuel alone, will be US$2 million. The U.S. Fleet has been stationed entirely in the Pacific since 1932, and only moved to the Atlantic in April of this year. Although naval authorities claimed that the long-term stationing in the Pacific was a normal training plan, the tense situation in the Far East at that time caused the world to make various speculations. When the United States recognized Soviet Russia, the fleet was transferred to the Atlantic, and thus the claim that the United States and Russia would jointly restrain Japan also naturally subsided. This return to the east should not cause panic. (20th National Telegraph dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of the Navy Swanson announced today that the U.S. Navy Department has abandoned the plan to build aircraft carrier cruisers, but denied that this decision was the result of a request from the State Department. It was widely rumored here last week that the State Department had requested the Navy Department to abandon the plan to build these cruisers because neither the London nor Washington treaties mentioned them. According to Swanson's statement, the Navy Department's abandonment was purely because these cruisers were not practical. (20th National Telegraph dispatch)</p>

<h3>A Bird's-Eye View of the New Soviet Russia: The Far East Military Fortress Is Strong and Invincible, Sufficient to Curb the Ambition of Aggressors; The Vast Wilderness Undergoes a Complete Transformation; A Letter from an Explorer on His Return Trip Extols Stalin</h3>
<p>(Moscow) An aviator who participated in the rescue of the Chelyuskin crew, on his return trip from Vladivostok to Moscow, wrote to Stalin, saying, "When flying over Soviet space, we can more clearly than others perceive its historic changes. These changes have completely transformed the face of our country. Small plots of private land everywhere have been replaced by vast fields of collective farms. Huge new buildings have become landmarks indicating our flight direction.</p>
<p>The new pictures we see from the plane every day are created by the hands of millions of workers. Their creation is under the guidance of the Communist Party led by you, advancing along the path of continuous victory for humanity. We deeply know that you are the initiator of the great work of rescuing the Chelyuskin crew. Please allow us to express our confidence, shown in participating in this struggle with nature to rescue the Chelyuskin crew, which is deeply engraved in our minds. We are about to arrive in Moscow, the capital of our Soviet country, and will first report to the government and you, saying, 'We are willing to fight again for the power, honor, and inviolability of our great country.'" All the rescued Chelyuskin crew members also sent similar letters to Stalin, saying, "In this country transformed by the efforts of the Party and the government, we have witnessed the extraordinary achievements completed by your unprecedented ability and the dedication to the goals of Lenin's seven sons. Returning from the Far East, we know how strong and invincible the peaceful fortress at the forefront of our country in the Pacific Ocean is. The Red Army and Navy are armed with the new technology of the Five-Year Plan, defending the borders of our country and preparing to cut off the greedy mouths of imperialism." (TASS, 20th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia Unifies Military Power: Minister of the Army Concurrently Chairman of the National Defense Committee</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Today, the Central Executive Committee ordered that Voroshilov be Minister of the Army and concurrently Chairman of the Soviet National Defense Committee. The Revolutionary Military Council and other bodies have been dissolved. Now the power to control the army and navy is concentrated in one hand. This measure seeks to unify power and facilitate mobilization. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<h3>Japan Plans to Expand Air Force: Preparing for War Against the United States and Russia; Establishing Air Units in Major Military Locations; Purchasing Aircraft Raw Materials to Achieve Self-Sufficiency in Wartime</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Navy, considering the increasingly serious international crisis, plans to establish air units in major military locations. It will realize its initial expansion in the tenth-year budget and fully consider the future, selecting Hokkaido as a candidate site. The Navy considers Nemuro or Akkeshi, and the Army considers Asahikawa or Sapporo as strong candidates. (Den-tsu, 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Minister of the Army Hayashi left Tokyo on the 15th to inspect the Matsudo and Kasumigaura air units. Hayashi spoke to reporters, saying that the army's fundamental countermeasure to the crisis of 1926 was to expand the air force. As for the specific plan for expanding the air force, the Minister of the Army said that it was a military secret and could not be disclosed. It is said that the countermeasures he wants to take are as follows: (1) Expanding aircraft manufacturing plants and increasing the manufacturing capacity of each plant to prepare for wartime self-sufficiency; (2) Training aviation personnel, paying special attention to privately run aviation schools and adding students to cultivate a reserve force for the air force; (3) Adding air force units in northern Japan and along the Sea of Japan to counter the Russian Far East Air Force and the US Air Force advance base on the Alaskan islands. Consider opening army air units in Sakhalin, Hokkaido, Akita, and other places, as well as Mount Fuji or the Fukui region; (4) Increasing funding for purchasing materials, purchasing more aircraft raw materials during peacetime for wartime use. (Hua-lian, 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Taiwan Army held a patriotic aircraft naming ceremony at the training ground at 3:00 PM today. Commander Matsui and Governor-General Nakagawa attended the ceremony. All three aircraft were light bombers. One aircraft was donated by students (the "Student" aircraft), and the other two were purchased with profits from sugar companies exploiting farmers. Japan is therefore increasing its air force strength to advance its aims in southern China. (Hua-lian, 21st)</p>
<h3>Hishikari Publicizes to the Outside World: Concealing Military Ambitions; Claiming that Japan and Russia Dare Not Go to War at Present</h3>
<p>(Dalian) According to General Hishikari, Commander-in-Chief of the Kwantung Army, in an interview with Reuters today, although Siberia is vigorously preparing for war, there is absolutely no reason for war between Russia and Japan at present. None of the issues in negotiations between the two countries are difficult to resolve peacefully. It is most unfortunate that several world newspapers say that the two countries may break off relations. Japan is currently busy reorganizing "Manchukuo" and does not even have time to think about military matters. Japan's policy is based on negotiation and reconciliation. The recent large-scale military demonstration by Soviet Russia, its intention is unknown, probably to make the whole world recognize Japan as a formidable threat, and if it wants to launch an attack, it must have a very strong army, etc. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<h3>Six International Aviators Plan Australian Air Race</h3>

<h3>Romanian Minister of Foreign Affairs Receives French Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>Romanian Capital French Foreign Minister Bartou held talks with Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu this morning, followed by an audience with the Romanian King and a royal banquet. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>Romanian Capital When French Foreign Minister Bartou visited the Romanian government, when the special train entered Romanian territory, in every city, residents dressed in full attire went to the station to warmly welcome him, especially in Cluj and Brasov. When the train passed through the wilderness, villagers saw the French and Romanian flags crossed on the special train, knew it was the train taken by the French Foreign Minister, and also raised their hands and cheered. When the train arrived in the capital, all the members of the Romanian government, Czech Foreign Minister Benes, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Jevtić, and most other diplomatic representatives went to the station to greet him. A large number of people gathered to watch. After Bartou got off the train, he personally went to the palace to sign his name. In the evening, Foreign Minister Titulescu hosted a banquet to welcome him, and 112 people were invited, including Benes and Jevtić. Titulescu delivered a welcome speech, saying that Romania expressed warm and deep sympathy to France. Bartou was moved by the words and stood up to thank him, briefly saying that the visits of envoys from various countries are purely for the sake of socializing, but there are also many cases where the two countries are in harmony and not bound by formalities, such as Foreign Minister Titulescu's recent visit and his reciprocal visit, which prove the consolidation of the friendship between Romania and France. Bartou also said that France and Romania have a traditional policy, that is, they always attach importance to the independence and dignity of other countries. The borders set by rights, France and Romania will not cross them, nor will they allow others to infringe upon them, nor will they allow anyone to harbor the idea of infringing upon them. Bartou repeatedly praised Titulescu, saying that Titulescu has a broad vision and never cares about others' hatred and criticism. He is a great figure in Romanian diplomacy and a loyal representative of the Little Entente. Mr. Ti's reputation is growing day by day and will eventually become a key figure in European peace, which France is very happy about. France cooperates with other countries, always with sincerity, and never intends to be a guardian. The Little Entente's plan is to seek economic construction in the Danube River basin, which is based on an open and honest attitude. The policy of the Little Entente is also the policy of France. Bartou also said that in addition to Romania and Yugoslavia, the Balkan Pact also has two friendly nations, Turkey and Greece, joining it. Titulescu's contribution to the success of this treaty is not small. The Balkan Pact, with its great significance, tells us that even countries that used to fight each other and hate each other the most, if they can sincerely get along with each other, there will be a day when they can achieve peace. Bartou continued, "From the Czech capital to the Turkish capital, this piece of land used to be chaotic, but now, thanks to the treaties established by various countries, it has gradually become a guaranteed zone. This kind of treaty has been further consolidated in the recent Geneva Disarmament Conference, because we have advocated that general security should be the main condition for disarmament, and this proposal is based on the spirit of various treaties." Bartou then said that France and Romania have linked relations in culture and spirit, and recently, when discussing international issues in Geneva, the views of the two countries were completely the same, which is gratifying. Mr. Ba concluded that Romania not only has a national spirit, but also has a European spirit, and is willing to cooperate with all countries that sincerely uphold peace to reconcile all legitimate interests, which is the same as France. On behalf of the entire French people, I congratulate Romania, its government, and its people, on peaceful development and a prosperous national destiny. These are heartfelt words, not empty words of politeness. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<h3>Mussolini and Hitler Obtain Limited Results</h3>
<p>Rome It has recently been confirmed that the concrete results of Mussolini's meeting with Hitler on the 14th and 15th of this month were extremely limited. It is said that the two prime ministers are also leaders of the two parties. Now that they have met in person, there are great hopes for the future. It is also said that the leaders of the PNF and the NSDAP are very satisfied with each other. On the first night, Hitler told German Foreign Minister Neurath that he had great sympathy for Mussolini and admired him. After the banquet on the second night, Mr. Xi said that the procedure for him to meet with interest had been completed, and he wanted to leave for Germany at 11:00 that night. His entourage dissuaded him, saying that it was inconvenient to fly at night and that it was not the original plan, so he flew back to Germany the next day. It is a mistake to say that he suddenly wanted to leave on the first night. The conversation between the two giants was not only wide-ranging but also very intense. According to the semi-official Italian newspaper, "The conversation between the two was sometimes even very excited." (Havas, 20th)</p>
<h3>Austrian Socialist Party: Terrorist Actions Gradually Subside; Many Bombing Cases Occur Before and After; Destroying Transportation and Burning Houses</h3>
<p>Vienna According to public notices here, the number and scope of domestic riots and disturbances seem to have gradually decreased, but according to reliable reports, there are still many cases of houses, bridges, railways, etc. being bombed. It is reported that in Freiburg alone, there were as many as 18 cases of damage to telephone lines, public houses, and railway property. In St. Martin, a ground wire was cut off, causing the entire city to be in darkness all night. In Schwechat, a public telephone bureau was blown up with a powerful bomb. Incidents of riots in other parts of the country are too numerous to mention. (National Telegraph, 20th)</p>

<h3>Dr. Rajchman's Report: Being Reviewed by Technical Group; His Return to China Undecided</h3>
<p>(London) Dr. Rajchman, the technical advisor to the Nanjing government dispatched by the League of Nations, arrived here today from Geneva. According to an interview with reporters from the Zeslin News, his report on China is currently being reviewed by the technical group. The group will continue to provide information on the situation in China to the League of Nations Committee with his assistance. The doctor also said that his return to China has not yet been decided. However, the cooperation between the League of Nations and China will definitely continue, and there are sufficient funds available for appropriation. However, future development depends on the governments of the countries attending the League of Nations Committee, especially the decisions of the major powers. China is eager to obtain assistance from the West, but the way of assistance is difficult to determine. The League of Nations cannot act alone, just as the moon relies on sunlight to reflect light. The doctor confirmed that international loans to China have not even been considered. He also said that the exchange of documents between Japan and the United States on March 21 will not change the United States' attitude towards the Far East, and this move does not show that the United States cares about China. He does not believe that the United States or any major power intends to recognize "Manchukuo." The League of Nations is greatly embarrassed by El Salvador's recognition, but we can do nothing about it. Since the League of Nations cannot stop Japan from seizing Manchuria, it would be too unfair to punish El Salvador for its recognition. (Zeslin News Special Dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>Japan Attempts to Conquer Our Country: The Tskamoto Missing Incident Was the Starting Point; Expected to Seek Opportunities Again to Achieve Its Aims; Mussolini's Observation</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Italian newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia published Mussolini's opinion on the Japanese-Chinese incident, saying that the Tokyo government should feel very disappointed that Deputy Consul Tskamoto was found, because it lost an opportunity as a result. Japan has already made many military preparations, and the Imperial government has prepared to establish Japanese police forces in the center of China. What does Japan hope for now? Japan takes advantage of the difficult autumn in European politics to gradually succeed in its plan to conquer China. The Tskamoto incident was a warning and a starting point at the same time. Japan only lost its opportunity to obtain Tskamoto, but its plan has only been temporarily postponed. (Central News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>Nagasaki Deputy Consul Tskamoto of Nanjing, who was recently abducted from Shanghai, arrived here at 0:40 PM today on the Shanghai Maru. Mr. Tskamoto only said that his health had recovered and stayed in the room, refusing to meet with reporters. Therefore, the secretary Yokokawa, who accompanied him, was in charge of the reception. Mr. Yokokawa said that Mr. Tskamoto's affairs had been detailed in various newspapers, and there were no new facts. As for the actions of his colleagues in the capital, the situation seemed very complicated, so he did not want speculation from third parties. In short, after the discovery of his colleague, the incident has been resolved, and the atmosphere in China is better than before. Mr. Tskamoto will return to Matsuyama for quiet recuperation after the ship arrives in Kobe. After recovering his health, he may return to his province to report for duty. (Den-tsu, 21st)</p>
<h3>German Ambassador to Russia Replaced: Nadolny Resigns Voluntarily; Russian Ambassador to France Critically Ill</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The German News Agency issued a statement saying that President Hindenburg ordered that Nadolny, the ambassador to Soviet Russia, be relieved of his post, and Schellenberg, the minister to Romania, be transferred to the post of ambassador to the Soviet Union. Nadolny's departure was at his own request for retirement and was not due to a change in Germany's policy towards Russia. Some foreign newspapers commented that this diplomatic personnel change was related to a certain issue between Russia and Germany, which is speculation and has no basis. (Havas, 21st)</p>

<h3>Roosevelt Receives Honorary Doctor of Law; Explains Administrative Thoughts; Appoints Officials Based Solely on Talent; Asks the People of the Country to Have a Broad Vision and Save the Crisis; Four Bills Including Telecommunications Become Law</h3>
<p>New Haven Yale University awarded President Roosevelt an honorary Doctor of Law degree today. President Roosevelt gave a speech, strongly defending the brain trust. The President declared that some people in the outside world ridicule the Federal government's employment of a brain trust, but considering today's political life, it is more necessary to employ a brain trust than before. The government's employment of a brain trust has been very successful, so it will continue to do so. The President compared his personal policies and methods with the policies and methods of Harvard and Yale universities, saying that it is commendable that all universities are willing to seek truth from facts. Since the government employed a brain trust, the government's appointment of officials has been based solely on talent, not on political skills. There is no greater example of national affairs not being in the hands of politicians than today. It is difficult for me to indicate what the political colors of the important officials in the government today are. In conclusion, the President asked the people of the country to have a broad vision, saying that the real danger to the country is at hand and the light is as small as a bean. (National Telegraph, 20th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The White House announced this morning that before President Roosevelt left for New Haven to receive an honorary Doctor of Law degree from Yale University and give a speech to the Yale alumni, he signed several important bills passed by Congress before its adjournment.

The second is the Relief Act, which allocates a huge sum of 170,150,000 yuan to relieve droughts and implement other federal relief programs. The third is the Industrial Loan Act, which allows the government to directly extend loans to various industries. The fourth is the US joining the International Labor Organization.

<h3>Japan's Third Special Agricultural Immigration to the Northeast: 450 People Selected Nationwide, Depart After One Month of Training</h3>
<p>Changchun Correspondence: The Japanese Colonization Ministry recently made a third special agricultural immigration plan to the three northeastern provinces. By June 15th, 450 volunteer immigrants will be selected nationwide. Qualifications are mainly those from rural backgrounds who have received in-country military training, or those who have excelled in in-country military education. The age must be over 35 years old. Those already adopted by the various regimental districts under the jurisdiction of the 5th Division are: Hiroshima 10, Fukuyama 15, Yamaguchi 25, Hamada 20. Volunteers must first register with the head of the local military association and the village chief. After the two have negotiated, the relevant regimental districts will be notified on the 22nd. Trials will be held in Hamada on June 6th, Yamaguchi on the 7th, Hiroshima on the 8th, and Fukuyama on the 9th. By June 15th, the Colonization Ministry will be reported to. Qualified persons under its jurisdiction are planning to carry out a short-term training of one month in Hiroshima, and each person will be given 80 yuan for implementation expenses, 150 yuan for equipment expenses, 75 yuan for livestock expenses, 30 yuan for clothing expenses, and 250 yuan for construction expenses. For one year, each person will be paid 5 yuan per month for food expenses. Each household will cultivate 150 mu of land. The cultivation will be handled by a puppet organization. Those who can grow rice are considered qualified. The land rent is extremely cheap. Once the training is completed, they will be sent to the Northeast for reclamation. It is expected that they will depart for the Northeast in mid-July of this year. (Northeast News Agency)</p>
<h3>Wu Ci Repents and Surrenders; Troops Reorganized into Security Brigade; The So-Called South China Army Dissolves</h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Notorious bandit Wu Ci from Zhangzhou and his thousand troops are scattered in the border areas of Hua'an, Changtai, and Longxi counties. They raised the banner of the so-called South China Army, with certain background. It is related to a certain Japanese ronin who secretly organized the false South China Plan. The plan disintegrated with the execution of Du Qiyun. Wu was a subordinate of Du, and after rebelling, he was used by the ronin. However, Wu's troops were a mixed bunch and were not concentrated. After the order to suppress them from the Eastern Route Headquarters was issued, Wu regretted being fooled by others. He sent representatives to a certain military officer to explain his plight, and also contacted Lin Chao, a liaison staff officer of the Special Operations Corps Headquarters of the Nanchang Headquarters, from Shanghang. He was formerly a battalion commander of the 49th Division and had previous dealings with Wu (Wu had previously been recruited by Zhang Zhen, commander of the former 49th Division, but later rebelled). Wu also sent people to contact Lin regarding the reorganization, saying that he could go to the front with the Special Operations Corps and that more than 300 of his troops who could be concentrated would be at the disposal of the government to show their sincerity. Lin, seeing his sincerity, forwarded the message to Chiang Ting-wen, Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Route, who recognized Wu's sincerity in reforming and allowed him to start anew. Lin Chao then went to Hua'an to discuss the matter with Wu and finalized the agreement. He reported back to Chiang Ting-wen, who ordered the Western District Security Sub-Bureau to reorganize Wu's troops into a security brigade under the command of the Western District Security Sub-Bureau. Wu then arrived in Zhangzhou from Hua'an on the 12th to pay respects to Chiang Ting-wen. Chiang praised his reform and appointed Wu as a counselor of the Eastern Route Headquarters. Wu then paid respects to Xiao Jing, the head of the Western District Security Sub-Bureau, for instructions. Xiao and Shao Lianbo, the captain of the 5th Company of the Special Operations Corps, hosted a banquet for Wu at the Jinhua Restaurant on Zhonglu in Yongjing on the evening of the 11th. Wu's troops have been gathering in Guokeng, Punan in recent days. As of the 16th, there were 300 people from Hua'an and Changtai. Wu's troops in Chuikou, about 100 people, were also transported by car to Guokeng on the 16th to concentrate. The Provincial Government then telegraphed its approval for Wu's troops to be reorganized into an independent battalion of the security brigade, with Wu as the battalion commander, under the command of the Western District Security Sub-Bureau. The so-called South China Army was thus destroyed. Wu's surrender was due to internal divisions, so only 400 people from Wu's surrendered troops were present. Furthermore, Wu was the foremost notorious bandit in Zhangzhou. Since Wu has surrendered, a certain party, even if they have a conspiracy, has lost its tool for appeal. This is also fortunate for Fujian Province. (June 18th)</p>
<h3>Rampant Banditry on the Guizhou Border: Divided into Two Groups Raiding Houwu and Chishui; Wang Jialie Goes North to Supervise the Troops</h3>
<p>Guangzhou: The bandits on the Sichuan-Guizhou border were slightly suppressed by the Hunan-Guizhou armies, but recently another group entrenched itself in Chishui. A certain Guizhou army unit is on alert along the Yangtze River. Wang Jialie has increased the number of troops sent to the front. From the 4th to the 6th of this month, there was fierce fighting with the He bandits. Wang Jialie ordered the two front lines to advance northeast, attempting to relieve Xiao Qing. The fighting in Chishui was very fierce on the 9th. On the 10th, the bandit positions wavered, but the bandits retreated to Chishui, planning a final struggle. On the 10th, Wang Jialie telegraphed that another group of Sichuan bandits was planning to invade Guizhou. One group remained in Pingwu, Sichuan. Wang personally went to the front to supervise the troops during the day. Wang's telegram stated: "(Omitted above) The He bandits have repeatedly invaded the border in Houwu, and all have been resisted by Commander Jiang's Zai Zhen troops, who have defeated them. Currently, a portion of the bandits are still on the Houwu border, and a portion has fled to Ganlongkou near Nanyaojie in Youyang and Songtao. There are still a large number of communist bandits in Youxiu, intending to flee to Guizhou and merge with He. Songtong feels very dangerous. In addition to strictly ordering all units to do their best to defend and suppress them, I will personally go to the Northern Defense in the short term to supervise the troops and advance to suppress them, in order to encircle and annihilate the bandit scourge in one fell swoop. As for the political reform plan, a clue has now been discussed, and it has been decided to convene a joint military and political meeting on July 1 to jointly seek solutions. I hope that you will present the details to Hu (Hanmin), Chen (Jitang), Li (Zongren), and Zou (Lu), and forward them to the people of Guangdong. Wang Jialie, (11th) Seal." According to reports, the leaders of the Southwest have requested the provinces of Hunan and Guangxi to increase troops to assist Guizhou Province in suppressing the bandits, to cooperate with the Guizhou army, and to plan for everything. As for the local militias in Zunyi and other places within Guizhou Province, they have recently seen the devastation caused by the He bandits and have jointly organized guerrilla suppression groups to suppress the scattered bandits. In order to assist the army in suppressing the bandits, the people of Guiyang have established a Bandit Suppression Support Association in Guiyang and have sent telegrams requesting assistance from all parties. A telegram received here yesterday stated: "The Red bandits are rampant, poisoning the area for a long time. The Red bandit base in Jiangxi has been gradually cleared under the supervision of Commander-in-Chief Chiang. The Red bandits in Sichuan, Hunan, and Hubei provinces have been surrounded and suppressed by the provinces and have fled in different directions. However, the Red bandit He Long's 8,000 troops recently invaded the Guizhou border from Pengyong, Sichuan. Houping, Wuchuan, and Yanhe have successively fallen. The bandits intend to seize eastern Guizhou to make it a bandit den. Warnings are frequent, and the situation is serious. Provincial Chairman and Military Commander Wang Gong Shaowu is well aware of the Red bandits' conspiracies and has sent elite troops to suppress them. All sectors have organized the Guizhou Provincial Bandit Suppression Support Association to assist the government in suppressing the bandits. It was established on June 2. The people of Guizhou pledge to work together to assist the government in suppressing the Reds. However, considering that the bandit forces are rampant and full of conspiracies, we earnestly request the Central Government to provide sufficient assistance to the Guizhou Province in suppressing the bandits militarily, and to request the generals of Sichuan and Hunan to assist in the suppression, so as to avoid the remaining bandits from growing stronger and harming the whole country. This is not only fortunate for Guizhou Province, but also a blessing for the Party and the country. The situation is urgent, and we await your clear instructions. Respectfully, the Guizhou Provincial Bandit Suppression Support Association, (9th) Seal," (June 15th)</p>

<h3>Notes from a Tour of the Northwest: "Yurts" and "Boardshen"</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent 賡雅</p>
<p>On the 29th at noon, a Mongol with a queue came to my tent for a chat. He spoke Chinese with great difficulty and stayed for a long time. I invited him to lunch, and he gladly accepted. Suddenly, I heard the sound of "Serber Nuo." A red-robed lama also came out from behind the tent, offering snuff as a sign of respect. (When Mongols meet, they exchange snuff as a courtesy. Even if they do not have a snuff addiction, they must carry it with them at all times.) None of my companions had any, so the first guest took out his own snuff and exchanged it with him, saying, "Ser, ser, Gadah Serber Nuo." Later, I invited the lama to eat together, and he also sat down. After eating, they all deliberately left some food at the bottom of their bowls. The camel driver said, "In some places in inland China, when the host invites guests to tea and food, the guests leave some food as a sign of respect. This custom may be known to the Mongols, so they did not dare to finish their food today. The phrases 'Serber Nuo' and 'Ser, ser' are Mongolian greetings. When Mongols eat, they can share their food with guests who are hungry. However, if they see someone eating and the host does not invite them, they will deeply hate them. It is like the saying, 'Remember the food, not the beating.'"</p>
<p>At 1 PM, we set off from "Saltwater Valley." After twenty li, we reached "Big Ox Ridge." The slope was slightly steep, and the top was flat. A well can be dug for drinking water. There is a high ridge to the right of the road. The corner of the ridge is shaped like a wing, which I suppose is a large lama temple, but it was too far away to visit. Suddenly, I heard the mournful cry of "Wo, wo." Upon inquiry, I learned that the dog carried by the camel team had bitten a lamb. There were many sheep flocks along the way, so I ordered them to tie up the dog with a rope. The reason why the dog bit the sheep was actually because of the bad habit of chasing rabbits that had been cultivated. The golden crow sank in the west, and the black night was vast. The camel drivers used electricity to identify the way and contacted each other with bells. At ten o'clock, the moon rose, as bright as a picture. We arrived at "Four Eyes Well" and stopped without advancing. The journey that day was sixty li. Mr. Zhu and Mr. Zhou scolded the camel drivers, saying, "Why don't you go another leg on such a good night?" The camel drivers replied weakly, and the argument almost turned violent. I thought that the camel drivers were uneducated, worked hard all day, and had a rough temperament, which was not unreasonable. Moreover, it was not appropriate to argue on the road when they were outnumbered. I tried hard to persuade them to stop. Later, the camel drivers did not light a fire or draw water. It was not until midnight that they cooked dinner. Suddenly, there was camel dung in it. We cooked noodles separately, which took even more time and effort. Tired, cold, and hungry, all at once. I was secretly angry, and it was difficult to express in words. Although I knew that the cart driver was messing around, there was nothing I could do. As the saying goes, "Cart, boat, shop, porter - even if innocent, they should be killed." Is this what it means? The place where we stayed was a large square on the ridge. There were four wells, from which the place got its name. The wells were seven or eight zhang apart, and about three zhang deep. There was only about a foot of water, which was as turbid as mud. We were warned that it was only for human use, and camels were not allowed to drink it. (Camels can go without water for six or seven days.)</p>
<p>On the morning of the 30th, a Mongolian woman came on a white horse, driving an ox carrying a bucket, to fetch water from the well. She also took out a lambskin to exchange for sugar, tea, and Rendan. We did not carry much, so we gave her a little, but only if she would guide us to see the "Mongolian yurt" (the felt tent where the Mongols live). The woman agreed and led us for two or three li, and we arrived at the place. Artemisia (a perennial herb in sandy soil, the main stem is as thick as an arch, and the branches are more than three feet high) was horizontally piled up to form a wall in a circle to serve as a sheep pen or a cow pen. The cow pen was smaller and covered with a roof. The sheep pen was larger and open-air. Cow dung was exposed on the Artemisia wall to be used as fuel. On the side, another Artemisia wall was built, or a willow was used as a fence, also in a circle. There was something in the middle, like a pot lying on the ground, which was the Mongolian yurt. The yurt was round at the bottom and pointed at the top. The inside was arranged with sturdy willow branches, shaped like a birdcage. The outside was covered with felt all around. A door was opened to the south, and a thick felt served as a curtain. The inside was shaped like a kiln, about eight feet high. The top was opened with a skylight to allow ventilation and light. It was covered when it rained. The ground was the model for the yurt, which was made into a circle about fifteen zhang in diameter. Food, bedding, and furniture were all placed inside. The layout was roughly as follows: the guest seat was to the left of the entrance (i.e., the western part of the yurt). Guests could sit on the ground facing east. The place for offering sacrifices to the gods was in the left front (i.e., the northwest corner), and a smaller and higher cabinet was placed there. The middle drawer was filled with parts and important objects. The head of the household was in charge of the keys. Silver dollars were mostly buried outside the yurt. A wooden box was placed on the cabinet, usually for offering "Lord Guan," "Lord Stove," and "The Big Dipper" three gods. If a family member was a lama, they also offered living Buddhas and other miscellaneous gods, all marked in Mongolian. The host seat was on the opposite side (i.e., the north). When sleeping, the host and guests each stayed in their original places, with their heads facing the shrine. Unmarried children slept with their parents in the main seat. If there were no married sons and daughters or guests, they could sleep elsewhere. The women's place was on the right (i.e., the east). Cooking and needlework were all done while sitting on the ground here. At night, daughters-in-law also slept here, with their heads facing their parents' feet. There is a saying that "guests are kept overnight, with a stick as a boundary. If the stick is moved in the morning, the host will definitely suspect the guest of having improper intentions towards the women at night." In fact, this is not the case. The remaining open space near the door (i.e., the southeast corner) was used to store grain and fuel. The center was the stove, which was built with ten stones in summer to prevent heat, and changed to an iron stove in winter to keep warm. Women were not shy in front of people when they had to go, but men and women had their own fixed places. Usually, a few dozen steps east of the yurt, stove ashes could be dumped, which was also the open-air toilet for women. The place where horses were tied west of the yurt was the place for men to urinate and defecate. The cloth clothes and sheepskin robes worn by men and women were often used as quilts at night. They ate mutton with their hands, and the oil was smeared on their clothes until they shone. The ground and felt were also often penetrated with sand and dirt. They did not pay attention to hygiene and were prone to diseases. When they were sick, they considered it a great shame and were ashamed to tell others. They did not seek medical treatment, but only knew how to recite scriptures. Those who lived near the border and were in a convenient location now gradually knew how to use Rendan for medicine.</p>
<p>In addition to the Mongolian yurt (called Ger in Mongolian), Mongols also live in the so-called "Boardshen" (also a Mongolian word). The architecture is like ten houses. This is imitated from the Han style. Those who live there are usually relatively wealthy and do not want to move elsewhere. The Mongolian woman guided us to see a Boardshen. The earthen kang and utensils were almost all Han Chinese style. A woman in her forties was sitting inside, cutting the hair of a fourteen or fifteen-year-old girl. When she suddenly saw guests arrive, she was not surprised. When asked, she answered, and if not asked, she did not speak. She lowered her head and still used the old-style iron scissors to cut the girl's hair as usual. It seemed that she had a special fixed nature. The girl had bright eyes and white teeth, and she wanted to smile but did not smile. Another younger girl ran and knelt in front of the guests, scrutinizing them and not leaving. Later, we asked to take a photo. They hesitated for a long time, seemingly unwilling, but it was difficult to refuse. They waited to change into other clothes, but they were not new clothes, and there were many patches. After the photo was taken, the girl swept the hair and buried it far away in the sand.</p>
<p>At 2 PM, we set off from Four Eyes Well, passing a circular square, which was more than ten times larger than the Shanghai Racecourse. Artemisia grass grew densely, shaped like a yellow felt. Near the edge, there was a slight amount of cultivated land. We walked for four hours before reaching the end of the square and gradually went downhill. We encountered someone moving, with about a hundred cattle and sheep. The furniture was very simple. The men wore Han Chinese clothes, while the women wore Mongolian decorations. When asked, "Where are you from?" they replied, "Chinese." When asked again, "What province and county?" they replied, "The grassland." When asked, "Then you are Mongols?" Although this answer had a grammatical error, it still had a national concept. At 11 PM, we stayed at "Rulai Ji Ling Zhao." We traveled 70 li. There was thunder and lightning, and dense clouds did not rain. There were several wells nearby, and the water was very clear and abundant.</p>
<h3>Shandong Provincial Party Affairs Disputes Resolved; Chen Lifu Attends Temporary Meeting; Li Wenzhai Succeeds as Standing Committee Member</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Shandong Provincial Party Affairs disputes have been delayed for many days without a concrete resolution. Zhang Weicun, the provincial executive committee member and standing committee member, has resigned from his position because he felt that his sincerity was not trusted. However, after persuasion from all parties and comfort from the central government, he did not step down. The central government has also ordered other committee members to return to Shandong to work as usual. However, because the opinions of both parties are not fully consistent, the current committee members took the opportunity of Chen Lifu's presence in Jinan and held a temporary meeting at the provincial party headquarters yesterday (19th) at 3 PM to ask Mr. Chen to guide everything. Except for Committee Member Han (Fuqu), who was absent due to affairs, and Committee Member Jiang (Bocheng), who was in Guangdong, all other committee members attended. Zhang Weicun presided over the meeting, and Lin Mingjiu recorded the minutes. After the meeting was formally opened, each committee member spoke in turn. Although there were debates during the meeting, the atmosphere was extremely harmonious. The original standing committee members were Han Fuqu, Zhang Weicun, and Zhao Weimin. Zhao Weimin resigned from his standing committee position on the spot, which was passed. Li Wenzhai was appointed to fill the vacancy. In addition, several important cases were discussed, and all committee members were very satisfied. The meeting adjourned at around 6 PM. At this point, the Shandong Provincial Party Affairs disputes have been completely resolved. According to Chen Lifu's statement after the meeting, Shandong's Party Affairs work has always been good. Now all comrades have sacrificed their prejudices and expressed their sincere cooperation. In the future, there should be better achievements and performance. (June 20th)</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Province Improves Papermaking</h3>
<p>Raozhou Tongjiu. Jiangxi province has the most abundant bamboo production, surpassing all other provinces. Due to the abundance of papermaking raw materials, the paper industry is also extremely developed. Among the more well-known products, the Lian Shi paper of Hekou, the Mao Bian paper of Yushan, the Biao Xin paper of Wanzai, and the cotton paper of southern Jiangxi have been sold throughout the country in the past, amounting to about seven or eight million yuan per year, making it one of the most important industries in Jiangxi province. However, because papermakers do not seek improvement and only know how to stick to old methods, their products have difficulty meeting the demands of the times, leading to increased imports of foreign paper year after year. The original sales markets of Jiangxi paper have almost been taken over by foreign paper. Currently, except for a few precious books that still use Mao Bian and Lian Shi paper, other textbooks, newspapers, notebooks, etc., all use foreign paper. Even the Biao Xin paper used for daily wrapping is now entirely replaced by imported kraft paper. In addition, banditry in the production areas has disrupted operations, causing papermakers to cease production. In the past two years, production has declined even further. The entire province's paper industry is now barely surviving. In order to restore paper production and improve products, the provincial government previously ordered the Department of Construction to draft a plan for establishing a mechanical papermaking factory, which was submitted to the provincial government meeting and approved for active implementation. Now, it has also sent letters inviting experts Wang Zheng-rong and Qian Zi-ning to Jiangxi to investigate the conditions of paper-producing areas in order to design and build factories. Wang and others arrived in Jiangxi last week in response to the invitation and have already set off separately to the Xinjian, Fengxin, Gao'an, Yifeng, Wanzai, Yichun, Pingxiang, Leping, Jingde, Guixi, Yiyang, Hekou, Qianshan, Jinxi, Lichuan, Guangchang, Fengcheng, Ganxian, Ji'an, Wan'an, and other counties in the western, eastern, and southern routes to conduct on-site investigations of the paper industry's production and sales situation, in order to study improvements.

<h3>Decline of Ramie Cloth Industry in Jiangxi</h3>
<p>Wuyuan Correspondence. Ramie cloth is one of Jiangxi's important industries and also one of the farmers' sideline occupations. The local ramie production is extremely rich, and the quality is particularly good. The fibers are fine, long, strong, and have a bright luster. In the past, when ramie cloth sales were booming, farmers cultivated, women spun, artisans wove, and merchants sold, with each specializing in their own work, and their incomes were abundant. However, in the past six or seven years, due to the impact of banditry and sluggish foreign sales, production has declined day by day. Recently, a Jiangxi cloth merchant came from Linchuan and spoke about the situation of the ramie cloth industry in the province, saying that six or seven years ago, Jiangxi's ramie cloth exports were about 600,000 dan or more, worth four to five million silver dollars. The quality of Yihuang and Wanzai was the best. In recent years, the production of various counties has decreased. For example, Fenyi has decreased by about 70%, Yichun and Wanzai have decreased by one-third, and Wuning, De'an, Anji, Xiajiang, Shangrao, Jinxi, Chongren, Anfu, and other counties are also in similar situations. Large sales destinations such as Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, 　羅, Singapore, and other places have had their sales markets seized by Fujian and Guangdong ramie cloth because of coastal transportation to the north. Japan and Korea have already automatically planted ramie and woven it, excluding our goods. Taiwan and the Northeast have been affected by the invasion of Japanese goods, resulting in a significant decrease in sales. In addition, banditry and national instability have led to a decline in the people's economy and a lack of purchasing power, resulting in a decrease of more than 30-40% each year. Last year, those engaged in the ramie cloth business suffered widespread losses. It is now heard that the Department of Construction has taken measures to provide relief, intending to start with improving spinning and weaving, reducing costs, bleaching, dyeing, and printing, and introducing new products.

<h3>Suzhou: Various County Treasury Offices Request Postponement of Establishing Treasuries</h3>
<p>In order to unify the financial revenue and expenditure of various counties, the Jiangsu Provincial Government issued a general order to all counties that, starting from the 23rd year, all tax revenues, except for the land survey fees directly submitted to the provincial treasury by the counties, should be included in the county treasury for unified collection and expenditure. The treasury offices of various counties, upon receiving this news, considered it a very important matter related to local finances and necessary to carefully consider it. Therefore, on the afternoon of the 20th, the directors of treasury offices from 30 counties in the Jiangnan area held a meeting in Suzhou at the Wuxian Chamber of Commerce for discussion. Attendees included representatives from 23 counties. Pan Qipeng of Suzhou was elected chairman. The newly revised organizational regulations and revenue and expenditure methods issued by the province were jointly studied. The opinions of all parties were summarized into three points: (1) Implementing treasuries was originally intended to consolidate local finances, but the boundaries between provincial and county finances have not been clearly defined and are insufficient to provide security. (2) Before implementing treasuries, the treasury should be clearly designated and inspected by local people in advance to prevent negligence. (3) The storage of treasury funds should be based on the principle that they cannot be moved or circulated. Therefore, the current designation of Jiangsu Farmers' and Two Banks as agents for the treasury, whether it can guarantee that it will not be used for other purposes, should be carefully considered, otherwise, abuses will increase greatly. The treasury management personnel in various counties are local people who serve voluntarily. This matter is of great responsibility and should not be handled rashly. The above three points should be clearly explained by the provincial government to clarify responsibilities. If it cannot be clearly determined, the custodial staff of treasury offices in various counties will have no choice but to resign unanimously. The above methods were unanimously agreed upon and resolved: (1) The directors of treasury offices from the attending counties will jointly send a telegram to the provincial and ministerial departments requesting a postponement of implementation until the financial bureaus of various counties are restored on August 1st, and then discuss unified financial methods. (2) Yu Xiaochuan, the representative of Zhenjiang, was publicly elected to contact the provincial and ministerial departments nearby.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Entire County Police and Militia Reorganized into Defense Teams</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Security Department believes that the names of defense groups and police teams in various counties are inconsistent and lack a unified system, making training and command difficult. In order to effectively reorganize them, the department has drafted a reorganization plan for defense teams, merging and reorganizing the police teams and defense groups of various counties into defense teams, and submitted it to the provincial government for approval. It instructed the counties to complete the reorganization by the end of June. County Magistrate Yan Shenyu of this county, after receiving the order, immediately followed it and drafted a reorganization plan to implement the merger of the county's defense groups and police teams into defense teams. It also drafted the organization of the squadron headquarters. In addition to the first and second squadrons of the defense group being reorganized into the second defense team, the original second and third squadrons of the police were reorganized into the third, fourth, and fifth squadrons of the defense team. Regarding independent detachments, the first and second independent detachments of the defense group were reorganized into the first and second independent detachments of the defense team. The training team of the defense group was reorganized into the third independent detachment, the independent detachment of the police team was reorganized into the fourth independent detachment, and the water patrol team was reorganized into the fifth independent detachment. In total, the entire county was reorganized into five squadron headquarters and five independent detachments, with a total of approximately one thousand officers and soldiers. Wang Wei, the former police battalion commander, was sent by the county to the province for review and awaits further appointment.</p>

<h3>More Disputes in Cheng Party Headquarters</h3>
<p>Disputes have repeatedly arisen in the Party Headquarters of this county. Previously, the Provincial Party Headquarters dismissed Xu Chenghua, Gu Di, and staff members Chen Da etc. for having addictions, and replaced them with alternate executive and supervisory members. Executive Committee member Tang Kesheng resigned and was replaced by Huang Bingying. At the 98th Standing Committee meeting on the 19th, former Standing Committee member Chen Lan and Committee member Wang Jihua were absent. Xue Chan was elected chairman and it was decided to reallocate work. Chen Xiping (female) was appointed as the Standing Committee member in charge of organization, Huang Bingying was appointed in charge of training, and Chen Xuechan was appointed. A letter was sent to former Standing Committee member Chen Lan requesting the transfer of the Executive Committee seal in advance. After receiving the letter, Chen stated that due to the suddenness of the matter, he did not immediately comply. Chen Xiping had been studying in Shanghai and had been away from the meeting for six months. Now, upon returning from Shanghai, she impatiently convened a meeting without waiting. It is questionable whether this situation is legal and needs to be referred to the Provincial Party Headquarters for review. Since then, disputes have arisen again. Both sides contacted the Provincial Party Headquarters by long-distance telephone for instructions. The Provincial Party Headquarters, considering the situation of Jiangyin's Party affairs, decided to resolve the matter entirely. The principle has been decided that personnel will be sent to take custody first and then personnel will be sent to reorganize in order to restore Party affairs.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Assassins and Robbers Executed by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>Yu Canrong, near Fuqiao in Wuyi City, was previously assassinated and robbed of a large sum of money. The county government's investigation team arrested four suspects in this case: Zhu Zhilin, Gao Xida, Zhu Mao, and Gao Wang. Upon further interrogation, it was revealed that the mastermind was Qiu Yifeng, a former tax collector, who had a deep grudge against Yu Canrong due to litigation. He hired Zhu Zhilin and others to assassinate him and rob him of a large sum of money. Except for Qiu Yifeng, who is on the run and being actively pursued, Zhu Zhilin was sentenced according to the Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits and was presented to the provincial government, which approved the execution by telegram on the 20th. County Magistrate Cai signed the order at 3 PM that afternoon to bring the criminal Zhu Zhilin to the case, verify his identity, and bind him to the Fengwei Mound execution ground for execution by firing squad. As for the bandit Zhu's wife, Mao, she was escorted by the police to Shizhuang for release after the incident.

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Issues Notice to All Counties to Prevent the Spread of Locust Plagues</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government, in view of reports of locust plagues from various counties, which are of great importance to agricultural harvests, had the Construction Department draft five articles of locust control measures, which were approved by the provincial government and issued to all counties. The case investigation shows that locusts are the most severe pest to crops, reproducing quickly and spreading widely. It is estimated that the province's annual losses in the past amount to more than millions. The provincial government is concerned about the people's suffering and cannot sit idly by. It is now the autumn season of severe drought, which is the time when locusts occur. In addition to separately ordering and ordering the counties that have reported occurrences to effectively implement prevention and control, the county magistrate is specially ordered to pay attention to the following points: (1) Now is the hatching period of locust eggs. They should order their subordinates to pay attention to prevention at any time. If any are found, guide the masses to adopt methods such as digging, clearing, poisoning, and releasing ducks to quickly eliminate them immediately. (2) If a locust plague occurs in a certain district within the county, they should do their best to supervise and direct the township chiefs to lead the masses to eliminate it locally and not allow it to fly to other districts. At the same time, they should order the neighboring districts where the locust plague occurred to pay attention to prevention and assist in the work. (3) If a locust plague occurs in adjacent areas of County A and County B, in addition to handling it in accordance with the above article, the neighboring county should also be notified to take precautions. If a locust plague occurs at the junction of the two counties, they should cooperate in prevention and control and should not shirk responsibility to each other. (4) Counties where locusts occur, unless otherwise stipulated in the regulations, should report the date of discovery, location, area of spread, direction of migration, control methods, and date of eradication to the Construction Department for approval at any time.

<h3>Zhenjiang County Government to Renovate Scenic Spots</h3>
<p>The Zhenjiang County Government, since the Southeast Transportation Exhibition is about to come to the county, all reorganizations have been transferred to various districts and property offices for compliance. Now, after investigating the Ancestral Hall of Wang Taishou Renkan, which was previously built at Zhongleng Spring, it is also a local scenic spot, but because the houses in the ancestral hall have been in disrepair for many years, they should be renovated as soon as possible to honor the former sages and enhance the landscape. The property office is specially ordered to hire workers to carry out the renovation and complete it within a month.</p>
<h3>Haimen: Innkeeper Swindles Female Guest</h3>
<p>Hong Songyou, a native of Changshu, was detained in the Haimen County Detention Center on suspicion of theft in July last year. His wife, Ding, came to Haimen to rescue him and stayed at the Liu'an Inn in the county seat. Jiang Guoquan (a native of Yangzhou), the innkeeper, learned of this matter and, seeing that Ding was lonely and weak, colluded with Song Jingrong, who set up a restaurant, to swindle Ding, saying that she needed to go abroad for 300 yuan to arrange for her husband to be released. Ding believed it to be true and first paid 20 yuan in November last year and another 30 yuan in December. Until the other day (the 18th), the county government transferred Hong Songyou to the Changshu County Government for interrogation. Ding then realized she had been cheated and demanded the original payment from Jiang and Song. However, the two stubbornly denied it and kicked Ding's legs, injuring her. Ding then petitioned the county government to arrest Jiang Guoquan. Song Jingrong fled upon hearing the news. Yesterday (the 19th) afternoon, Xu, the adjudicator, conducted a court investigation. As a result, Jiang Guoquan was taken into custody and awaits the arrest of Song Jingrong before a retrial can be held.</p>

It was seen that a sleeping bag rope was threaded through the main beam of the house, which was more than thirty feet high, and hung down around the neck twice, with the feet not leaving the ground. The corpse was curved and the death was quite strange. The male corpse was wearing a blue cloth short shirt and trousers, and black velvet shoes. He was about forty years old. After a search, no surname was found, so someone reported to the local Public Security Bureau and forwarded it to the county government. The county government sent Adjudicator Zhai to inspect the scene on the 19th.</p>
<h3>Gaochun: Petition Representatives Go to Province for District Division Case</h3>
<p>Gaochun is located in a remote corner of Jiangsu Province and has rarely been known to people. In recent years, the East Ru problem has attracted the attention of various counties downstream of the Xu Huai River. Recently, it has been heard that the county has been ordered by the provincial department to reduce the seven autonomous regions into five regions. The people of the entire county, due to the slightly biased planning and many practical obstacles, have jointly presented the case to various party and government agencies, requesting a change to the original plan and an increase of one region. Wang Zhongjun and Han Zurong were selected to go to the province to petition. It is heard that they have received a considerable response from the provincial department. Representative Wang Zhongjun came to Shanghai on the 21st of this month to visit Chairman Chen, requesting prompt approval to prevent disputes.</p>

Unexpectedly, the traveler later committed suicide by taking a large amount of sleeping pill powder. He had not gotten up by noon the next day. The waiter called out to him but received no response and broke down the door, finding the guest's face had turned pale, knowing that he had taken poison. He was rushed to the Municipal Hospital for treatment. It is heard that the cause of the suicide was due to the inability to visit friends and financial difficulties.

<h3>Chairman of the Suiyuan Provincial Government, Fu Zuoyi, Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday for Inspection; Fu Talks About Visiting Shanghai for Travel and Inspecting Industry and Commerce; Short Stay for a Few Days, Then to Hangzhou and Wuxi for Ten Days Before Returning North; Suiyuan Province's Anmi Highway Completed, Directly Reaching Di</h3>
<p>Fu Zuoyi, Chairman of the Suiyuan Provincial Government, went south to Han and Beijing last month to meet with Zhang Xueliang, Deputy Commander of the Three Provinces Bandit Suppression, Zhang Qun, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, Premier Wang Jingwei of the Executive Yuan, and Military Commissioner Chiang Kai-shek to report on the situation in the province and made contacts. Now that the official business is over, he arrived in Shanghai from Beijing by overnight train yesterday morning. After a short stay of a few days, he will go to Hangzhou and Wuxi for sightseeing and to inspect local industries. Our reporter visited Mr. Fu yesterday morning, and his remarks and various circumstances are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Six People, Style Remains the Same</h3>
<p>Mr. Fu arrived in Shanghai by the Pinghu Joint Transportation train at 12 o'clock the night before last. He arrived at the North Station at 7:50 yesterday morning. The security team police and military band greeted him in the usual manner. Mr. Fu was wearing a white Western-style suit made of foreign cloth, his complexion was ruddy, and he was tall and imposing, with his style remaining the same. Accompanying Mr. Fu were a total of six people, including Duan Guanhai, advisor to the Suiyuan Provincial Government; Zhang Mei, a consultant; Wang Zeding, the second section chief of the provincial government; Fu Yousu; Bo An; and Lin Zhaoxuan. After Mr. Fu and his party got off the train, they were transported to the Cangzhou Hotel to rest.</p>
<h3>Mr. Fu's Talk: Shanxi Is Safe</h3>
<p>Our newspaper reporter drove to the Cangzhou Hotel yesterday morning to visit Mr. Fu. As it was our duty, we were immediately received with hospitality. After exchanging greetings, Mr. Fu first said, "I came to Shanghai once twenty years ago, and I also came to Shanghai for business three years ago. This is my third time. Although I have not been here often, the situation has progressed greatly." He also said, "This time, I am very happy to come south to meet Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and various central party authorities. The situation in Suiyuan Province is relatively stable. There are two infantry divisions, an artillery regiment, and a cavalry brigade stationed in Suiyuan. The banditry is gradually being suppressed, but the economic situation is difficult."</p>
<p>The reporter then asked if Mr. Yan Xishan was safe, as rumors had been rampant in the south some time ago, but had now subsided somewhat. Mr. Fu replied, "Mr. Yan did indeed fall ill before, but he has now fully recovered his health. The journey to the south is long, and it is easy for villains to spread rumors, which are not worth a laugh." As for coming to Shanghai, it is entirely for a private trip. I will stay for a few days and then go to Hangzhou and Wuxi to inspect the industrial and commercial situation, so as to provide a reference for the construction of Suiyuan Province. I plan to return north in about ten days.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation in Suiyuan Province: Relief for Rural Areas</h3>
<p>According to Section Chief Wang, Mr. Fu's visit to Shanghai is purely for sightseeing and has no other tasks. However, Shanghai is the financial hub of the country, with many factories and developed industries. Mr. Fu intends to take the opportunity of his visit to conduct some inspections to serve as a reference for revitalizing various industries in Suiyuan Province. He will stay in Shanghai for three or four days, visit major factories, and then visit Hangzhou. On the way back, he also plans to inspect the silk and yarn industries in Wuxi. However, the date of his trip to Hangzhou has not yet been determined. Wang also said that the garrison in Suiyuan currently consists of two divisions under Mr. Fu and Wang Jingguo. In the past, there was a lot of banditry on the border, but now that Sun Dianying's troops have been resolved and reorganized, the banditry has gradually been suppressed, and the area is very peaceful. The urgent tasks at present are to provide financial relief to the rural areas. Therefore, the provincial government is working hard to establish rural granaries and set up credit cooperatives. The funding will be jointly handled with the Ping City Official Money Bureau, and the Official Money Bureau itself also plans to set up branches everywhere to facilitate circulation. In other construction aspects, efforts are being made to expand telecommunications and open up roads. Since the completion of the Sui-Xin Highway last year, cars can now directly reach Dihua. The Minsheng Canal was previously jointly excavated by the China and Foreign Famine Relief Association and the provincial government, and is now being assisted by the National Economic Commission. When the entire project is completed in the future, the water conservancy situation will also improve significantly.</p>
<p>Territorial Division of Inner Mongolia Still Under Discussion</p>
<p>Wang also said that after the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government, there are rumors that several areas on the border of Suiyuan Province will be placed under the administration of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government. This matter is currently under study and discussion, and no concrete decision has been made. Finally, the reporter asked about the various ambitions of the Japanese as reported in the foreign press. Wang replied that the Japanese ambition to invade the Northwest of our country has always been their consistent policy, but nothing of what the foreign press reported has been heard here. In short, if the people of our country do not seek unity and defend our border areas, it will be difficult to avoid arousing the ambitions of foreign powers.</p>
<h3>Paying Respects to the War Zone, Wu and Yang Host a Banquet</h3>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning, Mr. Fu went out to visit guests. In the afternoon, he visited Mayor Wu of the Tiecheng City District and inspected the relics of the war zone. Today, he will visit major factories in the city for reference. It is reported that Mayor Wu and Police Chief Yang Hu of the Security Bureau will host a banquet for Mr. Fu and invite leaders from all walks of life to accompany him.</p>
<h3>Report from the National Seaport Quarantine Office: Plague Found in Longyan</h3>
<p>According to a world telecommunications report, the National Seaport Quarantine Administration reported yesterday that a plague has recently been discovered in the Longyan County area of Fujian Province. Many people have been infected and died, and the situation is very alarming. They have received a telegram from the Ministry of Health stating that they need to quickly find ways to suppress the plague so that its spread will not be too widespread and harm residents. After receiving the instructions, the Seaport Quarantine Administration immediately telegraphed the Fujian Seaport Quarantine Branch, instructing them to send personnel to investigate the truth, report the epidemic situation in detail, and plan methods for eliminating the plague.</p>
<h3>Tang Youren Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tang Youren, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, left Beijing on the Jinghu overnight express train the night before last and arrived in Shanghai at 7:30 yesterday morning. After arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Tang received reporters from the Xinsheng News Agency at his residence and gave a speech, stating that Yan Huixing, our country's ambassador to Russia, had submitted his resignation to the government due to his old age. The government strongly urged him to stay and has indeed canceled his resignation. He will be granted a slightly longer period of leave and will absolutely not be allowed to retire. Gu Weijun, the minister to France, is also returning to the country for purely personal reasons. Mr. Gu has been in France for two years and has requested leave to return to the country. As for the incident of the Shuntian cargo ship of the Mogu Company being robbed, the government attaches great importance to it. In addition to sending warships to vigorously pursue the robbers, it has also sent land and air forces to search, hoping to resolve the matter as soon as possible.</p>

Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, and Mr. Zhang's relatives and friends personally went to the station to greet him. After Mr. Zhang got off the train, he took a car with Secretary-General Yu to rest at his private residence on Avenue Albert. Our newspaper reporter had the opportunity to speak with Mr. Zhang on the train yesterday morning. According to him, the situation in Hubei Province has improved significantly compared to before. The bandits have been surrounded on all sides and will soon be completely wiped out. The people are now able to live and work in peace. Various construction projects will be gradually implemented, except as limited by economic constraints. He has been away from Shanghai for almost five months. This time, he took advantage of the opportunity to come to Shanghai for a short stay to take care of family and personal affairs.

<h3>Rickshaw Reform Plan: Opinions of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Trade Association, Letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Public Concession Public Works Department yesterday, stating: "We are writing to inform you that at the fifth member conference held by our chamber on June 17, the Rickshaw Trade Association proposed that we send a letter to the Public Works Department to stop the unreasonable suggestions of the Rickshaw Committee of the department, in order to maintain the business of rickshaw operators. It was found that when the Public Works Department established the Rickshaw Committee last year, it made six suggestions on the rickshaw issue based on incomplete and untrue investigations. The board of directors also did not conduct a detailed investigation, and all thirteen articles except articles one, one, and three were completely passed. Most of them are unfavorable to rickshaw operators, and the most impossible of these is the policy of changing the rickshaw style and reducing the number of rickshaws. The committee specially set up to manage rickshaw affairs in May of this year has disregarded everything and gradually implemented strict measures, which are on the verge of bankrupting rickshaw operators. Now, they are exhausted and have no other choice but to make an urgent appeal. The reasons are briefly stated as follows: (1) There is no need to improve the rickshaw style. The main points of public rickshaws are that they are strong, clean, safe, and hygienic for passengers, not beautiful in appearance. Recently, the rickshaw authorities have inspected vehicles and vehicle bodies, ordered them to be renovated, and most of them have already been improved. If the style is changed again, would it not be superfluous? (2) It is impossible to reduce the rent. Rickshaws have costs, donations, repair costs, room rent, and labor costs. There are also real expenses for rickshaw puller relief and all charitable causes. In addition, small coins are collected and large coins are spent, and the depreciation is even greater. At a time when the price of silver is soaring, the losses of rickshaw operators are already not small. If the rent is reduced again, the rickshaw industry will be bankrupted. (3) Setting up a management office is even more shocking. In Chinese and foreign business, there is absolute freedom. It has never been seen that a management office is set up for any business. However, in the case of rickshaws, in addition to the original police station, a committee is set up to manage them again, searching for reasons to strictly crack down on them. Its intention is to deprive them of their business freedom and eliminate the rickshaw industry. We propose that a letter be sent to the Public Works Department, asking it to take into account the interests of business and deal with the rickshaw issue carefully." This was submitted to the conference for discussion and resolution. It was decided that this case should take into account both the interests of rickshaw operators and the welfare of rickshaw pullers, and a letter should be sent to the Public Works Department to handle it. Accordingly, we are sending this letter to you, and we propose that you temporarily exempt other unnecessary improvements to the rickshaw style within the scope of ensuring that it is strong and clean. The matter of rent reduction should be based on the principle of being able to maintain the normal life of rickshaw pullers and the normal interest rate of rickshaw operators. Is it appropriate to reduce the current fourteen cents to eight cents? We ask that your department conduct a detailed reconsideration so that the interests of both parties can be taken into account. We look forward to your reply. (Xinsheng News Agency)</p>
<h3>Presentation from the Trade Association</h3>
<p>The Rickshaw Trade Association of the Special District of this city, regarding the various facilities of the Rickshaw Management Office of the Public Works Department, yesterday afternoon specially dispatched representatives Yin Zhiling, Ma Xianshi, and Hou Shao to visit the General Office of the Public Works Department to explain everything and request the abolition of the Management Office and that it still follow the instructions of the Rickshaw Affairs Office. The text of their presentation is recorded below:</p>
<p>The presentation states that due to mismanagement, there is a widespread protest. It requests that you consider the difficulties of the business and comply with the situation. We have found that the rickshaw industry has been under the management of the Police and Rickshaw Affairs Offices of your department for decades, and all has been well. Since the establishment of the Rickshaw Committee last year, all constructions and resolutions have been unfavorable to rickshaw operators. A portion of the rickshaw affairs has been separated from the Rickshaw Affairs Office in charge and a separate Management Office has been established, named the Rickshaw Affairs Committee. Since the establishment of the committee, it has only urged rickshaw owners to improve the rickshaw style, provide relief to rickshaw pullers, and reduce rickshaw rental rates, without considering the interests of rickshaw owners themselves. It has also set a deadline for applying for licenses and permits, using this as a way to coerce them into fulfilling harsh conditions. The various facilities have become increasingly severe, and nothing is more extreme than this. It is found that the resolution of the Board of Directors of your department contains the following statement: "The style of public rickshaws should be improved as soon as possible." According to its wording and interpretation, it means to improve the original style, not to create a new style of rickshaw. Moreover, it means that the matter must wait until the possible period before it can be implemented. Furthermore, since the rickshaw is named "public," it naturally cannot be the same as the style of a private rickshaw. However, the Management Office disregards everything, ignores the style improvements that rickshaw owners are contributing to, and wants to abandon all existing rickshaws and prepared materials and make the most extravagant, most valuable, and least sturdy rickshaws similar to the style of private rickshaws as the standard. Not only will rickshaw operators suffer irreparable losses, but it is also inconsistent with the resolution of the Board of Directors. As for the relief of rickshaw pullers, your department has already collected 50,000 yuan from rickshaw owners and handed it over to famous people in Shanghai and abroad to design and manage. This can be seen in Chinese and foreign newspapers. Now, we hear that the Management Office wants to force rickshaw owners to collect an additional five cents of small money per shift as a relief fee for rickshaw pullers, and to pay the Management Office one yuan and five jiao of silver dollars per month per rickshaw as a fee for organizing a mutual assistance and relief association. This kind of method is not mentioned in the resolution. Even when considering the various labor undertakings in your concession, there is no precedent for this. It is difficult to say that it is not intentional. Moreover, taking and then giving is actually self-help for rickshaw pullers. How can it be called relief for rickshaw pullers? If it is implemented, it will not only fail to show benevolence, but I am afraid it will also cause public criticism. Other matters, such as reducing rickshaw rental rates, are even more surprising. In Chinese and foreign business, there is no freedom. Even in your concession, all commercial rents can only increase or decrease. Only the rickshaw industry has a regulation on reducing rental rates, which is unfair. Your department previously ordered a rent reduction in accordance with a resolution, and rickshaw owners painfully reduced the daily rental rate to twelve cents of small money and submitted an operating form and income in small money and expenditure in silver dollars for verification. At that time, twelve cents of small money could be exchanged for one silver dollar. Now it is worth fourteen cents. In addition, recently, rickshaws have been taken care of and are brand new, and the expenses have been huge. The Management Office has disregarded the difficulties and has stipulated that the daily rental rate will be reduced to ten cents of small money from August 1 of this year, and to eight cents of small money from January 1 of next year. It seems that it will be reduced again and again, and it is unlikely that they will not go bankrupt or close down. If you do not believe it, please commission an accountant to inspect the situation in the rickshaw shops. The pain can be understood. If you insist on going your own way, it is not the way to treat rickshaw operators. Your department believes that this matter is of great importance. On June 18, it convened a general meeting of all rickshaw owners at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, attended by more than a thousand people. All said that the Management Office is a duplicate agency of the Rickshaw Affairs Office, unfamiliar with rickshaw affairs, disregarding the difficulties of the business, and eating thick salaries. Even if all expenses are not paid by the rickshaw industry, they are still embezzling the donations of the citizens. There is no need to establish it. As for the various new methods and facilities imposed on us, not only have we not been agreed to by the relevant people, but we have not been informed in advance. Arbitrarily forcing us, their voices were hoarse and unusually indignant. As a result, it was decided that all new methods and facilities demanded by the Management Office would be unanimously rejected. In the future, we will still follow the regulations and listen to the instructions of the Rickshaw Affairs Office. A special committee will be organized on the spot to deal with emergencies. This was passed. On the 20th, another general meeting of all members was convened to discuss the resolutions of the rickshaw owners' meeting. The result was a decision to implement the plan, and it was decided to promote Yin Zhiling, Ma Xianshi, and Hou Shao to visit the authorities and explain everything in person. This was also passed unanimously. Accordingly, copies of the various cases have been prepared and submitted in writing by the representatives, requesting your approval, compliance with the situation, and continued handling of rickshaw affairs by the Rickshaw Affairs Office, so as to avoid panic among the masses and allow them to engage in business with peace of mind. We respectfully present this to the General Office of the Public Works Department. (Xinxin News Agency)</p>
<h3>The Citizens' Union Appeals for the Cai Case: Yesterday Asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Negotiate, Sent a Letter to the Public Works Department to Expedite the Transfer of the Detective to the Court for Trial, Otherwise the Citizens in the Concession Will Make a Serious Statement</h3>
<p>According to Xinxin News Agency, the Citizens' Union of the First Special District of this city stated that Detective Lang Sheyin of the Laozha Police Station falsely accused Cai Yangqi, a warehouseman of the Shanghai Jiangshun Public Land Freight Line, of applying electric torture seventeen times, causing permanent disability. Yesterday, they specially requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate according to law and sent a letter to the Public Works Department requesting that the detective be sent to the court for trial in accordance with the agreement, otherwise the citizens would make a serious statement to protect their legal rights. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<h3>Presenting to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</h3>
<p>To Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing, Cai Yangqi, a warehouseman of the Shanghai Longxiang Public Land Freight Line, was falsely accused of stealing by Detective Lang Zuyin of the Laozha Police Station in the Public Concession. The court found that he had no connection and released him. However, Cai was subjected to electric torture seventeen times while detained at the police station, resulting in permanent disability. His wife, Cai Fan, filed a complaint with the First Special District Court. The court accepted the case and summoned Detective Lang Zuyin to appear in court for questioning. However, the summons was returned without reason three times, which is obviously intended to protect him and is sufficient to undermine the agreement and disregard legal authority. If we do not fight for this, the citizens of the Shanghai Special District will forever fall into darkness and have no way to seek redress. In addition to sending a letter to the Public Works Department ordering it to comply with the agreement and send the murderous detective to the court for trial in accordance with the law, we are specially sending a telegram to your department requesting you to negotiate in accordance with the law to protect sovereignty. This is a public sentiment. The Citizens' Union of the First Special District of Shanghai,</p>
<h3>Letter to the Public Works Department</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of citizen Cai Yangqi, who was subjected to illegal torture by Detective Lang Zuyin of the Laozha Police Station, after the court issued a summons to Lang Zuyin three times, he refused to appear in court. Moreover, the official summons issued by the court was returned by the relevant police station without stating any reason. The Chinese Taxpayer Association and the Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession have also sent letters to your department requesting that this improper behavior be corrected. We have heard that our association believes that the refusal of the police station under your department to accept the court summons without reason violates the agreement and disregards legal authority. Moreover, the person being summoned is a public official of the police station under your department, and he should not refuse to appear in court, which is suspected of covering up wrongdoing. If this practice is allowed to continue, it will have a significant impact on the lives, freedom, reputation, and property of citizens in the concession. We find it strange that your department has not corrected this. We are sending this letter to you in all seriousness, requesting that you order the relevant police station to send Detective Lang Zuyin to the court for trial in accordance with the law. Otherwise, the citizens in the concession will make a serious statement to protect their legal rights, in order to promote your department's awareness. We are sending this letter to you, hoping that you will investigate and handle it.</p>

<h3>Repairing the Dike from Shitou Village to Dache Collection Will Soon Be Completed</h3>
<p>After the completion of the damming project, the Workers' Relief Group of the National Government's Yellow Committee has undertaken to add more than 30 li of dikes along the riverbanks from Shitou Village to Dache Collection in Hebei Province to raise and thicken the dikes to protect against floods. It also monitors the construction work done by the Hebei Post-Disaster Reconstruction Engineering Office. Director Kong Xiangqian inspected the Yongding River and returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday. He immediately telegraphed the group's inspectors to inquire about the progress of the work. The telegram stated that 140,000 square meters of earthwork had been completed in the Shitou-Dache section, and more than 6,000 people were still working on the project. It is expected that the entire project will be completed by the end of the month. The Hebei Post-Disaster Reconstruction Project will be monitored by Inspectors who will be stationed at the site to supervise the work. The project is being rushed to be completed by that field, which will complete the Shitou-Dache section. The water level is now falling daily, and the work situation is very good. Mr. Kong also plans to take a train north tonight to inspect everything in detail.</p>

<h3>New Shuntian Wheel Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday: The Captain Reported to the Company on the Robbery, Strict Security at the Pier and Inspection of Passengers, the Company Plans for the Aftermath and Will Sail as Usual on Saturday</h3>
<p>The incident of the New Shuntian Wheel of Taikoo Company being robbed by pirates and 26 Chinese and foreign passengers and crew members being taken away has been reported in this newspaper several times. At 5:30 pm yesterday, the New Shuntian Wheel had returned to Shanghai from Yantai and Qingdao. The captain immediately reported the robbery to the company. After arriving at the port, the reporter also went to the ship to inquire about the truth of the robbery. The comprador of the ship detailed the process. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Inspection Upon Arrival in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The New Shuntian Wheel left Qingdao the day before yesterday afternoon. It entered the Wusong Estuary at 3:35 pm yesterday and docked at the Taikoo Pier on the Bund of the French Concession at 5:30 pm. After receiving the news from the Taikoo Company in Shanghai, the French police temporarily dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to maintain strict security around the pier. News reporters and relatives and friends of passengers and crew members in Shanghai were given temporary passes by the company. After the ship docked, passengers and crew members were prohibited from going on and off the ship. First, the detectives boarded the ship to inspect the passengers, but no suspicious persons were found. Then, news reporters were allowed to board the ship, and passengers and crew members were allowed to disembark.</p>

<h3>The Bandits Are From the North</h3>
<p>According to the ship's comprador, the bandits who robbed the New Shuntian Wheel were all from the north, including people from Shandong, Zhili, and Fengtian. There were about 30 bandits in total. The bandit leader and his assistants boarded the ship in Tanggu, traveling in the official cabin. The other bandits were scattered in the steerage. The New Shuntian left Tianjin at 4 pm on the 17th. At 10:30 pm that night, the bandits first started a commotion in the steerage, claiming that they had lost their clothes. They then swarmed out of the cabin and started robbing. The bandit leader claimed to be Commander Wang, and the bandits were all soldiers under Liu Zhennian. All carried the latest-model Mauser pistols.</p>
<h3>Execution Claims Retaliation</h3>
<p>The bandit leader, claiming to be Commander Wang, told the crew of the Shuntian Wheel that after he retired, he lived by transporting goods. Most of the goods he transported were artificial silk and other foreign goods with high tax rates, which were secretly loaded at the Dalian port and transported to Yantai, Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places. The Tianjin Customs Inspection was very strict in checking for smuggled goods. On two occasions, the goods checked at the Tianjin and Yantai Customs were worth 1.7 million dollars. Therefore, he resented the customs and finally planned to rob a foreign merchant ship in order to cause a difficult negotiation and retaliate. The bandit leader also claimed that the first ship they planned to rob was the New Shengjing Wheel. However, because the agreed-upon civilian ship did not arrive, they had to change their plan and rob the New Shuntian Wheel.</p>
<h3>The Situation During the Robbery</h3>
<p>The bandits started the robbery at 10:30 pm on the 17th. They claimed that they had lost their clothes and swarmed to the outside of the cabin. First, they occupied the radio station, then went to the room of Compraodr Sun Rangsan, forcing Sun to lead them to the captain's room and identify the crew members one by one, acting as an interpreter. Sun was forced by the bandits to guide them, and later changed to Compraodr Chen Heqing. Mr. Chen was forced by the bandits to run around for 16 hours. The bandit leader occupied the compradr's accounting room as the headquarters for issuing orders. The bandit leader also had an accountant who managed the stolen goods. It was very organized. The bandits robbed the ship for a total of 18 hours. The passengers were searched four times, and everything was robbed clean.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Losses</h3>
<p>There was one Japanese passenger, Sugimoto, ten Western passengers, and three children. There were a total of 85 Chinese passengers. The bandits were very thorough in their search, so almost all the cash carried by the passengers was robbed. Among them, the most was about a thousand yuan, and the least was several tens of yuan. The bandits would return the small amount of three or five yuan. The jewelry of one Western woman that was robbed was worth 1,600 yuan. Three Chinese female passengers were also robbed, but fortunately, Mr. Chen Heqing repeatedly pleaded with the bandits and they were not searched, preserving a lot of goods. In general, the passengers' losses were at least 30,000 yuan. The accounting room on the ship lost more than 4,000 yuan, Comprador Sun lost more than 1,000 yuan, the captain lost more than 1,000 yuan, and other crew members and supervisors also lost more than 1,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Circumstances of the Kidnapping</h3>
<p>After the robbery, the bandits immediately kidnapped passengers and crew members. Initially, they intended to kidnap the ship's owner, but after Mr. Chen Heqing's earnest plea, they changed their target to the first mate. The bandit leader then wanted to kidnap a Western woman and three Chinese female passengers. Again, after Mr. Chen's repeated requests and his claiming the three Chinese women as relatives, the leader agreed to spare them. Therefore, the Western leader ordered the kidnapping of younger individuals of Shandong origin, while people from the South were generally not kidnapped, for reasons unknown. As for Mr. Sugimoto, the Japanese man who was kidnapped, his demeanor was very composed, and he even had a Chinese servant accompanying him who went with the bandits.</p>
<h3>Ross Shot Four Times</h3>
<p>The first mate, Ross, was shot a total of four times by the bandits. Three shots hit his arms, and one grazed his skull. The reason for the shooting was that Ross, being young and strong, resisted when two bandits were threatening him. He rose up and held one bandit, using his hands to strangle the bandit's throat. The bandit was near death when another bandit urgently opened fire on Ross. After being wounded, Ross fell at the doorway of the ship owner's cabin. Because it was night, it was suspected he had died. The bandit leader then admonished his men, asking why they had shot and killed someone. The bandits apparently did not want to kill anyone. Later, Mr. Chen discovered that he was not dead and, after consulting with the bandits, had the ship's owner bandage Ross's wounds and help him into the cabin, thus saving him.</p>
<h3>Civilian Boats Transport Military Supplies</h3>
<p>Five civilian boats were indeed pre-hired by the bandits. Boat T-1285 followed the steamer along the way, and boat T-144, even came close to the ship when anchoring at Shuntian, delivering two machine guns, many rifles, and ammunition boxes, apparently to prepare for a possible conflict on the ship. Additionally, three boats, Yandong 1209, 1072, and 1005, were used to transport the bandits' loot and the kidnapped individuals. The bandit leader, Commander Wang, along with the five kidnapped foreigners and the Japanese man's servant, boarded boat 1072. Twenty Chinese passengers boarded boat 1250. Another civilian boat with an unknown number was about twenty zhang away, also acting as an accomplice to the bandits.</p>
<h3>One Suspicious Matter</h3>
<p>In this recent New Shuntian robbery case, there is one extremely suspicious matter. Inside the passenger cabin, a large package of items was discovered, including many documents, letters, diaries, and rosters. The content was filled with many suspicious points. It is currently under investigation and cannot be disclosed. As for the bandits' escape location, it was between Lijin Estuary and Yangjiaowan Bay, within the territory of Wuding County, Shandong Province.</p>
<h3>Scars of the Second Comprador</h3>
<p>The second comprador, Mr. Chen, was forced by the bandits to run around the cabins for sixteen hours. While walking and standing, bandits held two guns against his body. When Mr. Chen tried to protect the Chinese and foreign passengers and pleaded to prevent the kidnappings, his neck was strangled by the bandits, and the scars are still visible today. The bandits attempted to force him to retrieve the keys to the ship's cargo hold. Mr. Chen falsely claimed that he did not know where they were at the moment, thus preserving the cargo in the various holds.</p>
<h3>Post-Incident Arrangements</h3>
<p>There were no separating iron bars inside the New Shuntian steamer, and there was no time to install them this time. The company is already discussing security arrangements, and iron bars will be added and the number of armed police escorts increased after the next trip to Shanghai. The self-defense firearms on the ship have been seized by the bandits this time and will be requested for reissue. The New Shuntian is scheduled to operate as usual on Saturday, but a strict approach will be taken towards passengers. Tickets will not be sold to those without reliable guarantors and those who are deemed untrustworthy, in order to ensure the safety of travelers.</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that the Taikoo Dockyard Company resolved yesterday afternoon that henceforth, its North China steamers would not carry Chinese passengers except for government officials and merchants known to the company, in order to prevent pirates from mingling among the mixed passengers, making it difficult to detect. It is expected that this measure will be implemented for some time. Orders have been telegraphed to the Qingdao, Weihaiwei, Yantai, and Tianjin branch offices and management offices to act accordingly. At the same time, careful anti-piracy plans are being developed with Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.</p>
<h3>Red Swastika Society's North China Relief Team Heads North Yesterday</h3>
<p>The China General Association of the World Red Swastika Society previously dispatched a North China relief team to the south for relief due to the war disaster in Fujian Province. They entered Fujian via Zhejiang, trekking thousands of miles, providing relief to soldiers and civilians along the way, saving many lives. After the war subsided, they opened a branch in Fuzhou, working with the Southeast Joint Relief Team to handle post-war disaster relief and assist refugees. On the 16th of this month, the two relief teams returned to Shanghai on the same ship. It is now reported that after several days of rest, the North China team departed north by train yesterday (the 21st). According to the team leader, Nie Benlin, this trip will require a two-day stopover in Jinan to discuss relief matters.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Orders Navigation Authorities to Rectify Ship Safety Equipment</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Communications stipulated ship safety equipment requirements, various shipping companies have failed to strictly comply, making maritime safety uncertain. Yesterday, another order was issued to various navigation authorities to seriously rectify this. The original text states that ship safety equipment should be seriously handled by various shipping companies and supervised by various administrative bureaus at all times. The Ministry has repeatedly issued orders to comply. Recently, the Hankou Navigation Administration Bureau reported on the handling of the collision between the Wanxiang steamer and a passenger steamer, stating that the Luan steamer carried over two hundred passengers but had only six lifebuoys and no other life-saving equipment. This is clearly due to negligence over time, treating the regulations as mere formalities, resulting in the inability to provide rescue when accidents occur. Based on this, it can be inferred that similar situations are unavoidable on ships within the jurisdiction of various regions. It is necessary to immediately instruct various shipping companies to seriously rectify this and for the bureau (office) to strictly supervise the implementation and promote safety. In addition to issuing separate orders, this order is issued to the bureau (office) for compliance. This is of utmost importance. This order.</p>
<h3>Joint Meeting of Executive and Supervisory Committees of French Concession Taxpayers Decides to Oppose Water and Electricity Price Increases After Studying the Articles of Association and Requests Chairman Du to Negotiate on the Issue of Increasing Chinese Directors</h3>
<p>The French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association convened a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees at 2 PM yesterday to discuss various proposals. The committee members present included Shang Mujing, Tong Lizhang, Zhu Shengmao, Wang Shunfa (representing Li), Lu Tingjian, Cheng Zhusun, Zhang Gengshan (representing Wu Guowei), Hong Jun, Li Weiliang, Qu Zhenhua, Dong Kechang, Huang Xianggu, Xue Fuji, Zhu Wenqi, Gu Wensheng, Mao Yun, and Gong Jingyan, totaling sixteen individuals. Chairman Cheng Zhusun first reported on the implementation of the resolutions from the previous meeting and read letters from various parties before starting to discuss the various proposals. (1) A letter from citizen Yang Hanqin opposing the French Municipal Council's increase in land taxes was discussed. (Resolved) A letter will be sent to the Municipal Council based on the letter, requesting consideration that citizens should not bear increased land taxes in this economic downturn. In addition to burdening citizens, the Association will request the French Municipal Council to follow the example of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, to add Chinese members to the real estate committee, and the Association will organize a real estate committee for research. The committee members Zhu Wenqi, Qu Zhenhua, and Gu Wensheng were nominated to organize it. (2) A letter from citizen Tang Gong, regarding her son A Zhong being run over and killed by a truck from the Hefeng Dyeing Factory, for which she has filed a private prosecution, but the French police are disregarding the lives of citizens and still not initiating a public prosecution. The Sixth District Branch of the Citizens' Association sent a letter requesting assistance. (Resolved) The Association will send a letter to lawyer Wu Kaisheng to provide legal assistance to the private prosecutor for relief, emphasizing the importance of citizen's lives. (3) A letter from residents of Hengfeng Lane and other areas requesting the French water and electricity company to amend its articles of association and disguisedly increase prices. (Resolved) Water and electricity are public utilities, essential for daily use throughout the French Concession, and of great importance. The company disregards the economic recession and the difficult livelihoods of citizens, using the amendment of the articles of association as a pretext to disguise price increases. After the articles of association are clearly studied, the citizens will be notified to unanimously oppose it. (4) The issue of increasing Chinese electrical capacity has exceeded the deadline and has not been effectively resolved. (Resolved) Chairman Du is requested to promptly take responsibility and negotiate with the French authorities. If there is further delay, the previously agreed-upon method will be followed.

(Resolved) Personnel will be dispatched to investigate and then handle the matter. (6) Tenants in Hengmao Lane believe that the landlord has already reduced rent for businesses but not for residents, which is unequal treatment, requesting mediation and assistance.

After discussing the above cases, the meeting adjourned at 5 PM.</p>
<h3>Meiya No. 9 Factory Ordered to Stop Night Work The French Municipal Council Said It Disrupts Neighbors' Sleep The Factory Said It Has Tried to Improve Without Disruption</h3>
<p>According to the Ta Kung Pao, the French Municipal Council recently suddenly sent police to order the Meiya No. 9 Silk Weaving Factory on Xujiahui Road to stop night work, causing the factory to suffer significant losses. Yesterday, they specially submitted a report to party and government agencies requesting negotiations to maintain business difficulties. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Ordered to Stop Night Work</h3>
<p>Meiya No. 5 Silk Weaving Factory at No. 1001 Xujiahui Road, French Concession, has been open for many years and has always operated in day and night shifts. In 1921, the French Municipal Council stated that night work disrupted the neighbors' sleep and ordered the French Public Works Department to send police to the factory to ban night work. After a protest was filed, the matter was resolved. The factory installed wooden shutters on the factory windows to prevent noise from being loud, which has now been completed. The sound of work at night is very quiet, and the area is remote with few residents, so there is no disturbance to the neighbors' sleep. However, on the 13th of this month, the French authorities ordered the French Public Works Department to notify them that night work was not allowed. While protesting, on the 14th, many police officers were dispatched to forcibly enforce the order, and the factory was forced to temporarily suspend work.</p>
<h3>Request for Serious Negotiation</h3>
<p>The Meiya Silk Weaving General Factory was alarmed by the French authorities' order to stop night work at Factory No. 5. The factory had already installed wooden shutters on the windows, and the sound was very faint, so it did not disturb the neighbors' sleep. Now, the French authorities have unreasonably suppressed the factory, which concerns the future of industry and worker unemployment. Therefore, yesterday, they submitted a report to the city party headquarters and the city government, requesting them to consider the difficulties of industry and commerce and promptly negotiate seriously with the French authorities to alleviate the difficulties of Jiangsu merchants.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Petitions the Executive Yuan to Sanction Fellow Traders Who Refuse to Join The Executive Facilities Should Be Consistent With The Legislative Policies</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday submitted a petition to the Ministry of Industry of the Executive Yuan. The petition states that according to current laws and regulations, companies and firms in the same industry are only required to join the same industry association, but there is no method for enforcing this against those who refuse to join. As a result, even after the amendment of Article 7 of the Association Law, its effectiveness remains zero. Over the years, various associations have repeatedly stated that their affiliated associations have petitioned the Ministry to supplement the enforcement methods in the implementing rules of the Association Law to remedy this. The Ministry has approved that the laws have not authorized the Ministry to supplement the enforcement methods, making it difficult to comply. Therefore, the difficult problem that various associations have been requesting to solve for many years is still deadlocked. Fellow traders of various associations believe that joining the association is entirely voluntary, while those who do not join the association are exempt from paying membership fees and are not bound by the resolutions of the association. Therefore, those who have not joined the association have no hope of joining, and those who have already joined the association inevitably withdraw. Membership is declining year by year, and the organization of some associations is about to face problems. The affiliated association held its fifth member congress on June 17, and various associations focused their discussions on this case. Several special cases were put forward, detailing the advantages and disadvantages. Article 7 of the amended Association Law stipulates that companies and firms in the same industry should be members of the same industry association and send representatives to the association, except for those who have been expelled. Joining the association is an obligation that the industry should have. Those who have the obligation to perform but fail to perform can be forced to do so or given appropriate sanctions according to general jurisprudence. This is not unique to joining the association. It is based on the principle that rights can be waived, but obligations cannot be waived. For example, members should bear the expenses of the association, which is an unavoidable obligation for members. However, if some members fail to fulfill this obligation, the chamber of commerce or association may formulate methods to impose sanctions on those who fail to fulfill it, which is the same as the obligation of the industry to join the association but fail to fulfill it. The only slight difference is that one is already a member, so it can be punished by the association's constitution, while the other is not yet a member, so the right to punish can only be executed by the competent authority in charge of industrial and commercial administration by formulating other regulations. This is the reason why the various associations have repeatedly made this clear. The Ministry stated that the law has not authorized it to supplement the enforcement methods, which is the most important key to this case and is not allowed to be said by the affiliated association. If the law stipulates that something should be done, it has imposed a specific obligation on certain people. If there is no enforcement method, how can the purpose of the law be achieved? Therefore, the so-called implementing law or implementing rules are set up to enforce the law, and some of them have supplementary effects. As long as they do not violate the original intention of the law, there is no need to explicitly state in the law that a certain chapter and section should be formulated separately by the competent department. For example, Article 30 of the Chamber of Commerce Law stipulates that members have the obligation to pay fees. Although the Chamber of Commerce Law does not authorize the Chamber of Commerce to assess the punishment of members who are in arrears, it is naturally allowed to have this power in jurisprudence, for no other reason than to complete the purpose of its laws. The point of contention in this case is whether the Ministry of Industry has this power. Therefore, the affiliated association does not hesitate to repeat it. Unifying production and unifying marketing are the barriers to resist economic aggression, which is related to the national policy and cannot be regarded as equal. How can an association with a mass of sand that cannot control its industry shoulder this important task? They can only sit and watch their imports soar and sigh together. Since the country has accommodated the merchants' request to confirm compulsory membership in Article 7 of the Association Law, there is a need for this in the current legislative policy, but on the one hand, there is no enforcement method to help them. This means that the executive facilities and the legislative policy are not consistent, which is what merchants are confused and helpless about. Therefore, the General Assembly decided to continue to petition the Ministry based on these reasons to determine the sanction methods for those who do not join the association. The case is recorded and submitted for inspection and approval for implementation.</p>
<h3>Rent Reduction Committee Asks the Public Security Bureau to Handle Rent Disputes Impartially</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rent Reduction Committee yesterday sent a letter to Director Wen of the Public Security Bureau, stating that the Nantao and Zhabei branches of the association have reported to the association that the public security bureaus in various urban districts often listen to the landlords' side of the story in rent disputes between tenants and landlords, detaining tenants and even ordering them to move out. Recently, landlords in various places, out of hatred for the rent reduction movement, often use disputes as an excuse to falsely report to the various district bureaus under your bureau, and the various district bureaus fail to investigate in detail, mistakenly believing one-sided stories and detaining tenants. It may be possible that landlords and tenants are a contractual behavior, and their positions are completely equal. Even if there are arrears in rent due to rent reduction, it is a debt-creditor relationship under civil law and can be tried by the court. If there is no violation of prohibitions, it does not seem appropriate to interfere, or even harm personal freedom. This letter is to inform Director of your bureau, and respectfully request that you instruct the various district bureaus to handle rent disputes in a balanced manner in the future. Sincerely, Shanghai Rent Reduction Committee.</p>
<h3>Anhui Construction Department Opens Huangshan She County People Ask to Preserve the Original Scenery</h3>
<p>Since various dignitaries advocated opening up Huangshan Mountain in Anhui, Liu Yiyan, the director of the Anhui Construction Department, has been actively proceeding. It is reported that the Yintun Highway will be open to traffic by the end of July, directly reaching the foot of the mountain. Yesterday, the Shanghai She County Association decided that they were deeply afraid that local people would build extensively and imitate Europe and the United States to show off extravagance, losing the natural wonder. Chairman Cheng Linsheng, Wu Yinhuai, and others sent a letter to Mr. Xu Shiying and Director Liu, advocating to preserve the original scenery and not repeat the mistakes of West Lake. The original letter is recorded below: "Mr. Jingren, Director Shian, we learned that you are paying attention to the opening up of Huangshan Mountain, and the Yintun Road is open. Travelers from Beijing and Shanghai can arrive in the evening if they leave in the morning. The magnificent and beautiful mountain of the past was only inhabited by hermits and visited by woodcutters and farmers. Those who are accustomed to seclusion can also live there. However, Huangshan Mountain is a natural wonder and does not need artificiality. If vulgar people build extensively and imitate Europe and the United States to show off extravagance, then they will disturb the heart of chaos, make the forest and streams ashamed, and cause orchids and cassia to wither. They will leave behind flaws and pollute famous places. It is very unnecessary. In our opinion, the architecture in the mountains should be pre-regulated, so as to preserve the original scenery. Between the pines, there should be stone stoves and a few tile houses, with winding roads and a hermitage. Then the mountains and forests will have knowledge and be drawn into the same tune. The beauty of West Lake is praised throughout the country. Since new-style residences and multi-story buildings have been built, the original appearance has been completely lost. Humorists say that Xizi is covered with dirt, which is not without reason. Now that Huangshan Mountain is just beginning to be opened up, we are deeply afraid of repeating the mistakes of West Lake. We offer our humble opinions and hope you will consider them. We wish you peace. Cheng Linsheng and Wu Yinhuai, Chairmen of the Shanghai She County Association."</p>
<h3>Re-Export of Foreign Goods Duty-Free Period Limited to Ten Years The Ministry of Finance Has Now Stipulated Three Measures</h3>
<p>Regarding the duty-free period and procedures for the re-export of imported foreign goods in the future, there are no clear regulations yet, which is prone to cause disputes. It is learned that the Jianghai Customs has received a ministry order stipulating the following measures: (1) All imported foreign goods that can present proof of duty payment are allowed to enjoy the benefit of duty-free re-export within a period of ten years from the date of import. However, after ten years, they will be treated as local goods. Export tax will be levied when they are transported to foreign countries, and transit tax will be levied when they are transported to other commercial ports in the country. (2) Regardless of the number of years, when imported foreign goods are declared for re-export, the original import situation cannot be verified. However, if the customs considers the reason for the merchant's statement that it cannot be verified is legitimate, it is allowed to handle the tax levy according to the regulations. Otherwise, it should be approved according to the chapter, and import tax should be levied without a tax payment certificate. (3) If merchants want to enjoy the benefit of duty-free export within ten years for foreign goods that have already paid import tax, they must apply for a re-export permit and properly preserve the detailed information of the original import of the goods for presentation to the customs for inspection and verification when declaring re-export within the time limit.</p>

<h3>Ningbo Native Association Emergency Meeting</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Sojourners Association of Shanghai, regarding the case of the large sum of money embezzled from Accountant Xue Mailuo's office, involving Ningbo natives Zhang Zuming, Zhuang Jimeng, and Wang Lianyou, deemed it a case of injustice and oppression.

Excerpts are recorded below: (1) Chen Zhiding, a native of Ningbo, 31 years old, manager of Wanyi Import Company at No. 1304 Beijing Road, and sole manager of the Western Cashier's Office at the Jiangwan and Yinxianggang Racecourses, stated that on the afternoon of the 9th, when the Jiangwan races were being held, he arrived at the racecourse before 1:00 PM to work. The races ran from 1:15 PM to 6:30 PM. Each race lasted about 25 minutes, and there were 13 races that day. During the eighth race, Zhang Zuming had lost all his money and borrowed 50 yuan from him. This was around 4:20 or 4:30 PM. Mr. Lin Pengfei was present and witnessed this. He saw Zhang Zuming at the racecourse at all times until the end of the races. When the thirteenth race was about to begin, Zhang Zuming asked him why so many people were buying tickets for a new horse. He replied that he did not know. He is willing to vouch for this matter. (2) Lin Pengfei, a native of Ningbo, 26 years old, residing at No. 9 Chongyi Xili, Tangshan Road, Hongkou, and shareholder and runner at Wanyi Import Company at No. 304 Beijing Road, stated that around 1:00 PM on the afternoon of the 9th, he went to the Jiangwan Racecourse with Chen Zhiding, Dong Zhengqing, and Hu Senfu to watch the races. As he had no experience with horse racing, he sat in the Western Cashier's Office. He saw Zhang Zuming beckoning outside the cashier's window, looking at the newly installed machines. Around 4:00 PM, Zhang Zuming entered the Western Cashier's Office and borrowed 50 yuan from Chen Zhiding, saying he had lost all his money. Chen Zhiding took 50 yuan, one banknote, from his pocket and lent it to him. Around the tenth race, he and Hu Senfu went for a walk in the field. He is willing to testify in court.</p>
<h3>Continued Detention of Involved Parties</h3>

<h3>Suzhou Creek Census Survey Causes Conflict; Seven Articles for Banning Docked Boats Promulgated; Patrol Officers and Police Injured by Bricks</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 2:00 PM, the second team of the Wusong River (commonly known as Suzhou Creek) Public Security Bureau's water police conducted a census of the poor living on boats along the riverbanks, leading to a major conflict. Patrol officers and police were injured by stones. Hundreds of ignorant people, holding incense, caused a riot. Fortunately, the Fourth District Public Security Bureau provided strong assistance, preventing a major disaster. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Origin of the Survey of the Poor Living Along the Banks</h3>
<p>Along the banks of the Suzhou Creek, west of the New Rubbish Bridge, there has always been a group of poor people living on boats, eking out a living on dilapidated vessels. During the spring of last year, the Dredging Bureau, while dredging the Suzhou Creek, found that the boats on both sides were obstructing the work. They petitioned the municipal government to take measures to ban them. The municipal government then ordered the second team of the Public Security Bureau's water police to evict the boat dwellers. However, these poor people immediately sent representatives, Jiang Weiqing and Zhou Bo, to petition the municipal government, pleading for exemption from eviction. The municipal government then changed the deadline for eviction to three months later. After three months, the poor people jointly requested an exemption from relocation. The municipal government authorities, seeing that the poor people were unwilling to move, then established seven articles for regulation: (1) The docking locations will be allocated by the Public Security Bureau based on the circumstances. (2) Navigation of the waterway must not be obstructed. (3) The waterway must be kept clean. (4) The Public Security Bureau will compile a register of households on each boat. (5) The Public Security Bureau will select two representatives for each designated area to be responsible for investigating everything. (6) Each representative must find a reliable shopkeeper to guarantee them and submit this to the bureau for record. (7) If any undesirable elements are discovered in each area, the representatives must secretly report them to the jurisdiction for arrest; otherwise, the representatives will be held responsible. An investigation and registration form was also issued, instructing the boat dwellers to register. Unexpectedly, this has not been implemented to date. Therefore, the municipal Public Security Bureau has again received urging from the municipal government.</p>
<h3>Municipal Public Security Bureau Issues Another Notice</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau issued a notice stating: "This bureau previously received Instruction No. 8288 from the municipal government, concerning the petition from Jiang Weiqing and others, representatives of the boat-dwelling poor on the Suzhou Creek, requesting the preservation of the poor's boat dwellings and exemption from eviction. Temporary permission was granted for berthing according to regulations, and seven articles were established. Following this, this bureau instructed the water patrol team to comply and report accordingly. Recently, it has been found that while many boat dwellers have complied with registration, there are also many who are hesitant and have repeatedly delayed. This situation is truly a violation of government orders. In addition to instructing the water patrol team to promptly handle and report, a copy of the seven regulatory articles issued by the government is enclosed, urging all boat dwellers to comply and not delay further, lest they be subject to banning. Urgently."</p>
<h3>Representatives Encouraging Registration Cause Trouble</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 2:00 PM, Xu Chizhi, a patrol officer of the first team of the Public Security Bureau's water police, received a phone report stating that two boat dweller representatives were at the white railings west of Hengfeng Bridge (near Macgregor Road), along the south bank of the river, encouraging registration and conducting a census. The boat dwellers misunderstood, leading to violence. Due to the large number of people, there was fear of a major disaster. Patrol Officer Xu immediately led Sergeant Xiao Shaohe, Constable Du Wenguang, and a dozen other officers, in two motorboats, to suppress the situation. At this time, there were about a thousand boat dwellers on the south bank. Due to relations with the International Settlement, they could not land. Patrol Officer Xu could only lead the sergeant and constables, rowing back and forth in the river, while the ignorant people on the shore or in the boats cursed and threw bricks. Lu Pei, the director of the second sub-station of the fourth district on the north bank, also dispatched police to assist upon hearing the news. However, the mob was overwhelming. Fourteen women climbed onto the motorboat, intending to destroy it. Patrol Officer Xu urgently ordered the boatmen to return. However, bricks rained down from both banks. Patrol Officer Xu and the constables were injured. After returning to the team, fearing that the boat dwellers would cause a riot due to their large numbers, he urgently telephoned the fourth district. District Chief Gong personally led all the patrol and detective officers to assist. Before long, six or seven hundred men and women, young and old, all holding incense, swarmed to the scene. At this time, the fourth district detectives had all arrived. (The water patrol second team headquarters was on the boat.) Patrol Officer Xu reported to the general team and requested instructions. By evening, he received orders from Section Chief Hong of the second section, instructing him to release the fourteen women he had brought back on bail from the boat dweller representatives Xu Lichang, also known as Xu Dechang, and Zhang Jinzhong. The six or seven hundred poor people then dispersed. It was also heard that two boat dweller representatives who were conducting the census had been beaten and went missing. Their whereabouts are currently unknown.</p>
<h3>Jing'an Ferry Resumes Service Today; Lawsuit to be Publicly Adjudicated on the 26th</h3>
<p>The Sanbei Company's Jing'an ferry, due to Yu Shicheng's false accusation of obstruction,</p>
<h3>University Student Huang Naiwu Plots Revenge on Dancer; Incites Others to Splash Acid; Mistakes Lead to Qiu Lifei's Suffering</h3>
<p>Qiu Lifei, a dancer at the Da Hu dance hall at No. 43 Avenue Hoche in the French Concession, was splashed with acid, burning her head, face, chest, and back, around 10 PM the night before last. The assailant and instigator were apprehended on the spot and taken to the police station for investigation. The cause and details of the incident are as follows: Li Xiuying, a dancer, 25 years old, from Tianjin, currently residing at No. 4 Gaoxingfang, Rue Maber, was previously an employee at the Sincere Company. Two years ago, she transferred to the dance hall as a dancer. Huang Naiwu, this year 20 years old, from Jiangxi, studying at a university on Route Luba in the French Concession, previously residing at No. 5 Fenghuayili, Avenue Joffre, now residing at No. 59 Daodelili, Rue Pellesier, met Li Xiuying two years ago while shopping at the Sincere Company. When Li entered the dance hall, Huang would go there every night. Gradually,</p>
<h3>Romantic Feelings Developed</h3>
<p>Huang wanted to marry Li, but Li saw Huang wasting money recklessly and advised him against it. Not only did Huang not listen, but he also harbored resentment towards Li. In his anger, Huang hired someone to hide a gun and lie in wait outside Li's residence, intending to kill her when she came out to vent his hatred. Fortunately, Li discovered the plot early and took precautions, avoiding the attack. Huang, unable to succeed in his plan, changed his tactics. He hired Jiang A'da, a Suzhou native residing at No. 15 Jingyeli, Quikui Street, Si Pai Lou in the city, pre-purchased a bottle of acid, and gave it to Jiang. He arranged to go to the Da Hu dance hall with Jiang the night before last, find Li, and tell Jiang, "If you see her dancing with me, that's the woman. You can splash her." Jiang agreed to accept the money. When the time came, Huang went to the dance hall first, and Jiang followed behind. Huang arrived at Da Hu and saw Li on the dance floor, so he</p>
<h3>Requested a Dance</h3>
<p>Li, due to her job, could not refuse and reluctantly danced with Huang. After three dances, unable to endure the harassment, she retreated to the restroom to hide. At that time, Jiang had not yet arrived. Huang entered the restroom again to invite Li to dance again, but Li refused and Huang left in disappointment. In anger, he danced with another dancer, Qiu Lifei (17 years old, a local resident living at No. 8 Rue Grolier, previously at the Da Hua dance hall and transferred to Da Hu on the first of this month). At this time, Jiang arrived, standing by. Seeing Huang dancing with her, he assumed it was Li Xiuying. So, after the dance ended and Lifei sat down on a chair by the edge of the dance floor to rest, Jiang immediately rushed forward, pulled out the bottle of acid, and splashed it on Lifei's head. Huang,</p>
<p>Lifei screamed in pain, causing ulcers in her mouth, and her chest and back were also</p>
<h3>Terribly Corroded</h3>
<p>Her clothes were completely destroyed. The hall was filled with noise. The assailant, Jiang A'da, was seized. People first poured water on Lifei's body to wash away the acid. The manager then sent Lifei to the Red Cross Hospital on Avenue Hoche for treatment and reported it to the French police. Inspector Jin Jiulin, detectives Zhang Ziying, Zhou Bingcheng, Bao Tan Xu Guilin, Zuo Qihong, and others rushed to the scene to search and apprehended Huang Naiwu near the artificial mountain in the garden. Huang Naiwu, Jiang A'da, the bottle of acid, and the damaged clothes were all taken to the police station. Yesterday afternoon, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special District Court, where Judge Xiong Huiping interrogated them. Police lawyer Yuan Jiahuan described the case, stating that the defendants splashed acid in the Da Hu dance hall,</p>
<h3>Injuring Dancer Lifei</h3>
<p>causing burns. The detectives arrested the two defendants. The victim</p>
<p>is in the hospital with serious injuries. A temporary decision cannot be made. He provisionally charged them under Article 294 of the Criminal Code and requested a postponement until the victim recovers. Detective Bao Xu Guilin reported the arrest of the defendants and presented the bottle of acid and clothes as evidence. Witness Li Xiuying testified about the breakdown of her relationship with Huang. The victim and the manager of Da Hu dance hall, Huang Mingshun, jointly hired lawyer Wu Peng and requested to file an incidental private suit, seeking damages. When questioned, Jiang A'da said that Huang Naiwu told him to splash the acid. Huang told him that he had known Li for four years and spent 5,000 yuan on her, so he was angry and told him to splash the acid to vent his anger. He was drunk and splashed the wrong person. Huang Naiwu said that he told Jiang to splash Li Xiuying, but he didn't recognize her and made a mistake. After comparing the testimonies, the court ordered a postponement to the 30th for another hearing. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<p>The Shenfu Fuzhou small ferry accident, involving court litigation and the dispute of impounded ship halting its operations, caused great attention in Shanghai shipping industry. This case is still in local court, and the argument on both sides has ended on the 20th. The public judgement is on the 26th. Since the Jing'an ferry's operations were halted, it's been two months, and it suffered large business loss. Sanbei Company decided that it will resume operation of the ferry boat first. It will depart to Fuzhou today, and the lawsuit is postponed until after the public judgement.</p>
<h3>Penglai Bank Robbery Case Judged and Transferred Yesterday; Also Committed Robbery Cases in the Concession; Unrelated Individuals Released After Investigation</h3>
<p>After the Penglai Bank in Nanshi was robbed, Gu Liancheng, the leader of the detectives of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, discovered that the gang of thieves was hiding in Room 36 of the Yuelai Hotel on Guangdong Road in the Public Concession. He led detectives Hu Kuish, Shen Jinchu, Shen Jinshan, Zhang Shaoming, Lv Anpu, Wang Hongyi, etc., and joined forces with detectives from the Old Zha Police Station to arrest Tang Amao, Chen Alin, Ge Yousheng, Fan Jinsheng, Chen Sandi, Yang Shenggen, Wu Hongxiang, Guo Bingwen, Chen Hongsheng, Chen Guiqing, Huang Liangqing, Shen Xingsheng, Li Zhirong (i.e., Liu Genfa), Chen Hongsheng, Zhu Xingfu, Wang Are, Lu Jinquan, Huang Genchu, the woman Gu Sandan, Chen Hu's wife, Wang Meiying, and other twenty-one people. Three pistols, twenty-four bullets, and three hand grenades were confiscated. They were handed over to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Ping Shide opened court for a continued hearing. Chief Chinese Detective Zhou Guisen stated that after the postponement, it was discovered that Lu Jinquan had committed robberies in the Public Concession, stealing 280 yuan from Qian Yuxing at No. 322 Seymour Road and 202 yuan from Hu Zhongwen at No. 1100 Xin Zha Road. The police had already filed a lawsuit. It was also determined that the woman Gu Sandan was indeed a prostitute, and Chen Hu's wife was not involved. Gu Liancheng then stated that Zhu Xingfu was actually Zhu Fafa, and that Zhu brought a hand grenade from the Haiquan Hostel. After investigation, it was found that Wang Meiying had opened the door for a robbery in Zhabei, allowing the thieves to enter. Some of the defendants were also repeat offenders. He requested permission to transfer them. When Zhu and Wang were questioned, they both vehemently denied the allegations. Police lawyer Gan Jingxian agreed to the Public Security Bureau's request for transfer. Judge Feng verified the report and ruled that Chen Hongsheng, Huang Genchu, Gu Sandan, and Chen Hu's wife should be released, and Lu Jinquan should remain in custody. The remaining defendants were allowed to be taken back by representatives from the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Leader Gu immediately stated that Chen Hongsheng was heavily involved in the Penglai Bank robbery and requested that he be required to post bail. The court ruled that since it had already been determined that he was not involved, there was no need for bail.</p>
<h3>Pawnshop Merchant Zhao Dingchu Sued by His Widowed Daughter-in-Law; Demands Alimony of 30,000 Yuan; Judge Attempts Reconciliation Without Success</h3>
<p>Zhao Dingchu, a native of Chaozhou, is currently 50 years old and resides at No. 14 Renzhili, North Sichuan Road. He is a pawnshop merchant, owning more than ten pawnshops in the Chinese and foreign concessions of this city. Due to his skillful management, his business has prospered, and he possesses assets of several hundred thousand yuan. He has several children. His eldest son, Junmao, married a Guangdong woman surnamed Ma in 1924. Ms. Ma was 17 years old at the time. Since marrying Junmao, they have lived together for ten years. The couple's relationship was very close, and they had a son and a daughter. The son, Zhenji, is 19 years old, and the daughter, Meimei, is only two years old and still in swaddling clothes. However, Ms. Ma's fate has been unfortunate. Her husband Junmao suddenly fell ill and died on July 17th of last year, leaving her a widow, alone and desolate. Fortunately, she still has her children, so she is not completely lonely, and she endures her life by guarding her chastity and raising her children. Unexpectedly, this year, Ms. Ma has become unwelcome by her parents-in-law and has been mistreated. On March 11th, Ms. Ma had a quarrel with her father-in-law Zhao Dingchu's concubine, Ms. Zhang, over a trivial matter, which escalated into violence. Ms. Zhang beat Ms. Ma with an umbrella handle, and Zhao Dingchu expelled her, accusing her of being unchaste and disrespectful. In her anger, Ms. Ma was forced to leave and return to her mother's home. She went to the hospital to have her injuries examined and has been resting at home. For several months, Zhao Dingchu has not provided any living expenses for her. She hired a lawyer to file a petition with the Civil Court of the First Special Court, requesting mediation. The result was unsuccessful, so she formally filed a lawsuit against her father-in-law, Zhao Dingchu, requesting that he allocate 30,000 yuan in alimony for her to deposit in the bank and use the interest for her living expenses and to raise her daughter. Yesterday morning, Judge Luo Chongtai presided over the hearing at the Seventh Civil Court. The plaintiff, Zhao Ma, brought her children to court and explained the circumstances of the abuse. When questioned, Zhao Dingchu claimed that the plaintiff was his eldest daughter-in-law. After his eldest son died, the plaintiff behaved improperly and was unchaste. On March 8th, she suddenly eloped without returning. After inspecting her wardrobe, all her clothes and jewelry were gone, indicating that she had been plotting this for a long time and was insincere. The next day, he received a letter from the lawyer accusing him of abuse. As his eldest daughter-in-law, she lived in his house, and her food, clothing, and shelter were all provided. He treated her well and never abused her. Now, she has eloped on her own, which has greatly damaged his reputation. Therefore, he is unwilling to take her back or bear any responsibility. As for the children she bore, he can accept them for upbringing. If the plaintiff insists on returning to his house, then she must first live in the Chastity Hall for a year and a half to cultivate her mind and nature before returning, etc. Judge Luo attempted to reconcile the two parties, but because they were unwilling to compromise, reconciliation was unsuccessful. The plaintiff's lawyer requested a debate, and the court ordered the case to be pronounced on the 26th of this month.</p>

<h3>Various Organizations in Hefei Request the Lawyers Association to Rescue Wang Shujiao</h3>
<p>Lawyer Wang Shujiao was detained by the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau last year on suspicion of involvement in the assassination of Song. At that time, the Shanghai Lawyers Association, the Fada Alumni Association, and other organizations actively sought his rescue, but have not yet achieved his release. It is now known that Wang Shujiao has been transferred by the Public Security Bureau to the Songhu Garrison Command for detention, and a verdict has not yet been reached. Recently, the Hefei County Lawyers Association, the Hefei County Education Association, the Hefei Local Finance Committee, the Hefei Journalists Association, and gentry, Zhang Jianchu, Xu Ketang, Wu Qingcheng, Yang Lichuo, Wei Bangru, Tang Renping, Zhu Pingfu, Shen Ziying, Dong Xingcan, Liu Junyao, Hu Haoru, Dai Zitong, and dozens of others, jointly affixed their seals to a letter to the Shanghai Lawyers Association, requesting that they seek the release of Wang Shujiao nearby. The reasons given were that they were willing to jointly guarantee that Wang Shujiao was indeed in Hefei on July 23rd, 1931 (because he was escorting the coffin of his father, Wang Houzhai, back to his hometown). They requested that the situation be quickly reported to the Songhu Garrison Command, allowing Wang Shujiao's release.</p>
<h3>British American Tobacco Factory Workers Request Assistance from All Sectors</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that the British American Tobacco Factory in Pudong, after closing one of its factories, triggered a full-scale strike. The attitudes of both the workers and the management are very firm, making mediation difficult. The workers previously sent a letter to the board of directors of the British American Tobacco Company, stating the responsibility for the strike and planned to host a banquet for all sectors of Shanghai on the 27th to formally organize a support association for assistance. The letter from the workers to the company's board of directors is as follows: "Regarding the statement, the company's unwarranted announcement of factory closure triggered a full-scale strike, which has lasted for more than a month without resolution. The company has withheld the wages due to all factory workers from April 15th to May 12th. Due to the prolonged work stoppage, the livelihood of all workers has become difficult, and it is impossible to delay any further. Therefore, this letter is written on behalf of your association, urging the company to pay the wages due to the workers from April 15th to May 12th in full and without delay, to avoid extreme actions and facilitate the resolution of the dispute. If your association does not heed this advice, this association will not be responsible for any accidents that may occur in the future."</p>
<h3>Lawyers Association to Hold Meeting to Discuss the Murder of Luo Zhaoxin</h3>

<h3>Retail Grain Business: Please Stop the Disturbances from Licensed Tax Collectors</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bean Market Street Retail Grain Business Association, during its third executive committee meeting held the other day, had a majority of members raise the issue of arbitrary disturbances and obstruction of business by licensed tax collectors, who were also forcing businesses to obtain licenses. They requested a method to stop this. On the spot, it was resolved to send a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, earnestly requesting the Jiangsu Provincial Education Funding Management Office to order the licensed tax collectors to refrain from arbitrary harassment and forced licensing of those who have joined the Retail Grain Business Association. The original letter is recorded below: We respectfully inform you that our members have repeatedly reported to the association that licensed tax collectors have repeatedly come to force them to obtain licenses, arbitrarily harass them, and seize account books. We earnestly request that your chamber send a letter to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, ordering Shanghai tax collection personnel to collect taxes in accordance with the law and to refrain from disturbances. As the association's members are retail merchants, their business is entirely retail sales. Those who engage in wholesale grain transactions and earn commissions are members of the Bean and Rice Trade Association, the Grain, Oil, Bean Cake Trade Association, and the Grain Brokerage Association, earning commissions based on volume. These are all things that your chamber is well aware of. Investigations show that the repeated disturbances by licensed tax collectors not only harm the business of merchants but are also inconsistent with tax regulations. We earnestly request that your chamber earnestly request the Jiangsu Provincial Education Funding Management Office to order the licensed tax collectors that whenever they encounter members who display the association's membership certificate, they are all retail merchants and should not be arbitrarily harassed or forced to obtain licenses, so as to maintain their business and comply with the tax law.</p>

<h3>Police Admire Deng Shaonong's Bravery: Present Mr. Deng with a Silver Shield, Award the Maid 10 Silver Dollars</h3>

<h3>Tax on Tobacco and Alcohol Licenses: Scheduled to Be Collected by Local Governments, Stamp Tax Is Not Assigned to Local Governments, Allocation Will Be Determined Based on Financial Situation</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the financial conference convened in Beijing will transfer the collection of tobacco and alcohol license tax and stamp tax, originally collected by the Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance, to local governments to offset the abolition of miscellaneous taxes and levies in various localities. It has now been decided that the tobacco and alcohol license tax will be transferred to local governments for collection on July 1st. The stamp tax matter will be implemented after the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Communications have agreed on a method. According to reporters' inquiries to the Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance, the details are as follows:</p>
<h3>General Situation of Various Provinces</h3>
<p>According to a spokesperson from the Tax Affairs Department, the provinces that have</p>
<p>established stamp and alcohol tax bureaus include Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Fujian, Hubei, Henan, Hunan, Shandong, and Hebei. Most of these ten provinces can remit the collected tax revenue to the department. Occasionally, due to the difficult financial situation of the local government, they only report the collection situation to the department and directly transfer the collected tax revenue to the local government for distribution. There are also some provinces where, due to other relationships, the establishment of similar tax collection agencies exists, but they have not been able to submit</p>
<h3>Types of Taxes Collected</h3>
<p>As for the types of taxes collected by various stamp and alcohol tax bureaus, they are roughly divided into stamp tax, tobacco and alcohol tax, and tobacco and alcohol license tax. In March of this year, the stamp and alcohol tax collected by various provinces was: stamp tax 569,136.68 yuan, local alcohol fixed tax 330,809.20 yuan, local tobacco special tax 86,755.59 yuan, Chinese and foreign machine-made alcohol tax 9,063.75 yuan, tobacco license tax 10,936.03 yuan, alcohol license tax 14,593.88 yuan, tobacco and alcohol fee tax 257,820.82 yuan.</p>
<h3>Date of Assignment</h3>
<p>According to the spokesperson, the tobacco and alcohol license tax has now been decided to be transferred to the finance departments of various provinces on July 1st. One reason is to save expenses and procedures, and the second is to make up for the finances of various provinces. As for the stamp tax matter, this type of tax revenue is not immediately assigned to the local government. If various localities encounter financial difficulties due to the abolition of miscellaneous taxes and levies, a certain amount will be issued from the stamp tax to make up for it. However, since the original stamp and alcohol tax bureau that collected this item has already been transferred to local governments for the collection of tobacco and alcohol licenses, it seems that the bureau does not need to exist again for the collection of stamp tax. Therefore, this matter will now be handled by the Ministry of Finance in consultation with the Ministry of Communications, entrusting it to the Post Office. In terms of time, it may not be possible to achieve it in a short time, but it is expected to be implemented within the year.</p>

<h3>Incoming Correspondence: Translation of the "North China Daily News" Commentary on the Termination of Shanghai-North China Water Line Operations by Great Northern and Great Eastern Telegraph Companies, June 8th</h3>
<p>The Great Northern and Great Eastern Telegraph Companies have transferred their formerly managed water lines to North China to the Chinese Telegraph Bureau. Subsequently, China has taken another step forward in managing its domestic transportation enterprises. Regarding the two telegraph companies, it would be difficult to overlook the invaluable service they have provided to China in the past. Naturally, there is some regret in giving up the water lines that the two companies have managed for the past thirty-four years. However, looking back on the services provided to Chinese and foreign merchants over the past thirty years, there are various reasons to admire them. Moreover, they have indeed become a model for the Chinese Telegraph Bureau, which would be well-advised to emulate it. Failure to do so is unthinkable. However, the standard of work in the past was quite high, and maintaining the same standard will require extraordinary effort.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Chinese authorities are now focusing their efforts on cultivating wireless communications, which may be detrimental to water lines. This should be noted.</p>
<p>The trend is progressing rapidly, but it seems unwise. If accidents occur in countries around the world, water lines have an advantage over wireless, a fact that is obvious and needs no further explanation. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities will make every effort to ensure that both forms of communication are fully maintained, so that one does not rise at the expense of the other. Regarding the aforementioned North China water lines, which were managed by two foreign companies but have now been abandoned, all sectors should extend their most sincere congratulations for pioneering telegraph services in China and completing extraordinary and beautiful work. Although natural developments have occurred due to changing circumstances, all sectors have not disregarded the previous excellent service of these companies, which they should find gratifying.</p>
<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3>How to Construct Popular Literature</h3>
<p>丨Answers to Mr. Wang Dao and Mr. Li Xiaoming, and for the instruction of Mr. Chen Wangdao and Mr. Chen Zizhan丨</p>
<p>Because this newspaper's "Free Talk" section has recently published several articles by Mr. Chen Wangdao, Mr. Chen Zizhan, and others on "Constructing Literature in Popular Language," many readers have raised questions with us. They ask: What is the difference between popular language and vernacular? Is raising this question a rehash of old "May Fourth" issues? How exactly should popular language literature be constructed? Although Mr. Chen and others have touched on these issues, some are not detailed enough, and others only touch the edge of the problem. Therefore, we elaborate on our opinions as a reference for readers who care about this issue.</p>
<p>We must first acknowledge that the popular language issue raised by Mr. Chen and others is very correct and crucial at the current stage of the literary movement. The "popularization" of literature has become a unanimous demand of literary creators and the reading public. To express the life of the masses, only using the language of the masses themselves can achieve success. It can also be said that the growth of popular language is already孕育in the actual life of the masses, waiting only for us to adopt it. This is not merely repeating old "May Fourth" issues, but advancing the language movement to a new stage, strengthening its own tasks. "Vernacular," as Mr. Chen Zizhan said, is merely something put forward by the intellectual class. On the one hand, it takes the language of the bureaucratic literati as a model (to borrow Mr. Wangdao's words). On the other hand, it unconditionally cites foreign comprador language (we believe that the vernacular achieved in the "May Fourth" era, the language of bureaucrats and compradores, is very appropriate), and is completely isolated from the life and language of the masses. We often see many sentences in current publications that are more difficult to understand than classical Chinese, and this is due to this reason. When society reaches a certain stage, it becomes an obstacle to the language movement, consciously preventing the development of popular language, and showing a miserable appearance of being neither fish nor fowl. Therefore, the current popular language movement is anti-classical Chinese and anti-bureaucratic comprador vernacular.</p>
<p>Because of this, we must not adopt a passive attitude towards this issue, but should actively strive for its victory from the dual tasks</p>
<p>We must first admit that the mass language issue raised by Mr. Chen et al. is very correct and essential at the current stage of the literary movement. The "popularization" of literature has become a unanimous demand of literary creators and the reading public. To express the lives of the masses, only using the language of the masses themselves can achieve success. It can also be said that in the actual lives of the masses, the growth of mass language is already breeding, just waiting for us to adopt it. This is not simply repeating old "May Fourth" issues, but advancing the language movement to a new stage, strengthening its own tasks. "Vernacular", as Mr. Chen Zizhan said, is only something put forward by the intellectual class. On the one hand, it takes the language of the bureaucratic literati as a model (to borrow Mr. Wangdao's words). On the other hand, it unconditionally cites foreign comprador language (we believe that the vernacular achieved in the "May Fourth" era, the language of bureaucrats and compradores, is very appropriate), and is completely isolated from the life and language of the masses. We often see many sentences in current publications that are more difficult to understand than classical Chinese, and this is due to this reason. When society reaches a certain stage, it instead becomes an obstacle to the language movement, consciously preventing the development of mass language, and showing a miserable appearance of being neither fish nor fowl. Therefore, the current mass language movement is anti-classical Chinese and anti-bureaucratic comprador vernacular.</p>
<p>Because of this, we must never adopt a passive attitude towards this issue, but should actively strive for its victory in the dual task</p>
<p>of struggle. Mr. Chen Zizhan's "tolerant" attitude of not feeling that the slogan of the revival of classical Chinese is important is, we believe, not very good. The "revival of classical Chinese" is by no means a few old relics attempting to rekindle the ashes, but is coordinated with venerating Confucius and promoting the reading of classics. Although "the general trend is that the final victory will not go to them," even those "twists and turns" are enough to delay the development of history for several years, not to mention "we do not put our enemies to death, and the enemy will eventually put us to death." Examples of this lesson can be found everywhere in history. We must have the spirit of combat to deal with this issue, we must accurately re-evaluate the "revival of classical Chinese" and then deal it a fatal blow. Secondly, Mr. Chen Zizhan only recognizes that mass language is a step forward from vernacular, and that "promoting mass language" is "to correct many shortcomings of vernacular literature." This understanding is also not enough. He does not see that vernacular is the object of mass language warfare, and that mass language is as opposed to vernacular as it is to classical Chinese. If we ignore this task, we will follow in the footsteps of the "May Fourth" movement and fail to complete the task of this mass language movement. We must oppose classical Chinese, and we must oppose the seemingly correct foreign eight-legged essay.</p>
<p>So, what is mass language? Mass language is the language that the masses use to express their own lives, growing out of the lives of the masses themselves. Mass language literature is the literature that Mr. Chen Wangdao said is "spoken by the masses, understood by the masses, easy to write, and easy to understand." Mass language has universality, is constantly developing, and is different from local dialects (some people used to advocate writing literary works in dialects, which is wrong, although we may use dialects). Dialect is a product of feudal society, and mass language should be a completely anti-feudal comprador language. Although its full scope is not yet apparent, as the lives of the masses progress, the barriers between the living languages of the masses in various places are gradually broken down, and new vocabulary suitable for the lives of the masses is increasingly added. Mass language will eventually be completed. This can be found in the path of its development from the development of language and writing itself (Mr. Wangdao has already explained this very clearly). It is not difficult to discover its roots even from a sociological point of view.</p>
<p>Since we have determined that mass language is not created by anyone, but is something that progresses with the progress of the lives of the masses, at the current stage of constructing mass language, we must not neglect that we must not only approach the masses, learn the common language from the masses, but also experience the lives of the masses, understand the actual situation of the lives of the masses, and understand how the lives of the masses are developing. The masses can understand "modern," "motor," and "ice cream" because the lives of the masses have progressed to the point of contact with these vocabularies. Twenty years ago, if you talked to farmers about "pen names," they at most only knew that it was equivalent to "the Long Hairs are rebelling," but now even a three-year-old child almost understands the meaning of the word. Away from the lives of the masses, you have no way to "import foreign languages ​​that the masses understand" or start using ancient languages. This is a point that Mr. Chen Wangdao has touched on but has not explained in depth.</p>
<p>In short, the presentation of the mass language problem is very meaningful, but if we do not take the lives of the masses as the content to enrich this problem, that is, not to make this movement consistent with the development of the lives of the masses, this movement will still fall into emptiness and not be able to overcome the enemy and not be able to solve the problem.</p>
<p>Due to space limitations, this article can only discuss this issue in general. If there are any points that have not been touched, we will have to wait for another opportunity to raise them for discussion.</p>

<h3>Accumulated Debts of Over 8 Million Yuan for Schools in Beijing and Tianjin to be Cancelled, Schools Hope the Auditing Department Will Find a Remedy, Xu Shengzu Details the Pain of Arrears, the Education Association Will Hold a Meeting</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Beiping) The funding for schools in Beijing and Tianjin relies on the Russian Geng indemnity funds. The accumulated arrears of Peking University, Beiping University, Normal University, Beiping Research Institute, China College, Sino-French University, and Tianjin Beiyang Institute of Technology have reached a massive 8,288,285.62 yuan. The Auditing Department has decided to implement a unified national accounting system starting from July 1st. It has consulted the Ministry of Education to instruct all universities in the country to issue receipts for the current month from July 1st and not to issue supplementary receipts for accumulated arrears from previous years. All accumulated arrears from previous years are to be cancelled. In other words, schools in Beijing and Tianjin will lose 8,288,285.62 yuan in accumulated arrears. The months for salary payments for each school are inconsistent. Some are paying for July and August of the 22nd year, some for May and June, and some for February and March of this year. The Joint Association of Faculty and Staff of Beijing and Tianjin Schools, in order to protect the interests of all its members, has telegraphed the central ministries and departments, requesting that a proper method be arranged for clearing the arrears, and has also telegraphed the Auditing Department to postpone implementation. Today (the 19th), the association issued a notice, deciding to hold a meeting on the 23rd to discuss methods for requesting the central government to clear the arrears from previous years. The situations of various parties are recorded separately as follows.</p>
<p>▲Accurate Amount of Arrears for Each School (1) National Beiping University, (1) Women's College of Arts and Sciences, 419,776.95 yuan, (2) Law School, 621,818.10 yuan, (3) Medical School, 114,217.54 yuan, (4) Agricultural School, 482,626.47 yuan, (5) Engineering School, 665,443.40 yuan, (6) Business School, 100,167.31 yuan. According to the old debts before the 17th year, due to the sudden turmoil in the college in November of the 19th year, all accounts and books were taken elsewhere by the former president Duan Huitang, making verification impossible. (7) President's Office, 9,874.12 yuan. (2) National Peking University, 2,603,837.24 yuan. (3) National Beiping Normal University, 2,097,395.47 yuan. (4) National Beiyang Institute of Technology, 661,080.09 yuan. (5) National Beiping Research Institute, 253,760.95 yuan. (6) China College, 85,587 yuan. (7) Sino-French University, 171,173.98 yuan. The total accumulated arrears for the above schools in Beijing and Tianjin is 8,288,285.62 yuan.</p>
<p>▲Four Schools Jointly Submit a Report to the Ministry of Education Accountants from the National Beiping Research Institute, Beiping University, Peking University, and Normal University recently convened a joint meeting to discuss the implementation of unified accounting methods. As a result, many difficulties were discovered. It was immediately decided that the four schools would jointly submit a report to the Ministry of Education, forwarding it to the Auditing Department, requesting that the difficulties be explained in detail and that a remedy be arranged for the accumulated arrears before July 1st. This report has already been sent. The original text is very long, but the general idea is to explain the difficulties in detail and request that a method be devised to clear the arrears. However, the reply has not yet arrived in Beijing, so it is still questionable whether it will be implemented on schedule on July 1st. However, when the Auditing Department previously sent personnel to Beijing, the schools also explained this difficult situation in person. The personnel were very understanding and promised to discuss remedies with the Ministry of Education after returning to Beijing and to issue instructions to Beijing before July 1st. Therefore, everything must wait until the Auditing Department and the Ministry of Education have agreed on a method before a decision can be made.</p>
<p>▲Xu Shengzu Discusses Unpaid Salaries in Detail According to Professor Xu Shengzu, the national schools in Beijing and Tianjin experienced frequent interruptions in funding before the 21st year and after the 14th year due to political changes. After the success of the Northern Expedition and the establishment of the National Government in the 17th year, the Ministry of Education announced that it would never owe tuition fees in the future, but that the Northern Government's arrears before the 17th year and after the 14th year would not be reissued. However, there were still occasional interruptions in the period from the 17th year to before the 21st year. At that time, the faculty and staff of various schools felt that life was difficult and had many debts. Later, they were unable to maintain it, so they organized a joint association of faculty and staff to fight for it with the central government. As a result, it was agreed to allocate 360,000 yuan per month from the Russian Geng fund starting from the 21st year and remit it to Beijing on time before the 25th of the month. In that year, the Funding Protection Committee was also established to manage and forward this funding. To date, it has not been interrupted. As for the detailed amount of arrears for each school, they are all the amounts owed from the 17th year to the 21st year. The amounts owed are inconsistent because the funds were mostly issued directly to each school by the Ministry of Finance at that time. After the central government allocated funds in the 21st year, the salary payments of each school and the funds related to the arrears were</p>
<p>still reissued according to the months of the arrears. Now, the central Auditing Department wants to unify the national accounting system, and it is inevitable that it will first fully reissue the accumulated arrears at once, which is not easy to achieve. This is because the accounting books and forms used for the unified accounting method are all new and are settled monthly. If monthly settlements are implemented now, there will be too many difficulties. As for how it will be implemented in the future, it still depends on what the remedy is, he said.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn Records of Royal Fragrance  Original by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>I can explain the detailed arrangement of these four vehicles in the simplest few lines of statistics:</p>
<p>(1) Fifty stoves,</p>
<p>(2) Fifty head chefs,</p>
<p>(3) Fifty assistant chefs,</p>
<p>(4) The exact number of laundrymen and other miscellaneous workers is unknown,</p>
<p>(5) A total of one hundred kinds of main dishes were prepared,</p>
<p>(6) Also one hundred kinds of pastries, fruits, candies, dried fruits, etc.</p>
<p>After reading these, it is not difficult to understand the general situation. In China, the issue of "food" is very particular. If written carefully, a thick volume or two of "recipes" can be completed in one go. Therefore, what the author recorded in this chapter is really only a very small part!</p>
<p>It can be said that the Empress Dowager's life existed for the sake of "eating"! This is not an insult; even I, a lady-in-waiting, am the same. No matter when, we always dislike having too much food, and never dislike having too little. Not only is the food in the inner court so rich, but even in our own homes, although the items prepared cannot be as precious as those in the palace, and the quantity is relatively smaller, each of us can eat as much as we want, even to the point of losing our taste for it, and feeling a headache the next time we see it.</p>
<p>There is also a special custom in the palace: the origin of the custom is not a matter of the past hundred years, so no one can explain its purpose anymore. It is only known that for every formal meal of the Empress Dowager or the Emperor, one hundred different bowls of dishes must be presented neatly. (Translator's Note: This is likely an exaggeration and should not be taken at face value.) (64)</p>
<p>The Decline of Small Vegetable Markets  Hua Ling</p>
<p>A recession blankets this great metropolis, once known as the Paris of the East, and also invades the small vegetable markets in this metropolis. Fishmongers stare blankly at the fish on their stalls, day after day, only selling three or four tenths of them. Small yellow croakers for three coppers each, large yellow croakers for sixteen coppers each, whether they get a small batch or a large batch, they sell out, the fresh ones have customers, the smelly and rotten ones also have customers.</p>
<p>The bellies of the meat shop owners are also not as protruding as before now. Of course, they will be wholeheartedly welcome those who buy one or two dollars' worth of meat, and they will put on a smiling face even if they buy pork tenderloin for three hundred wen or ten cents. In the past, ten cents was the lowest limit, but now, even for two hundred big coins, you can ask the meat shop clerk to raise his precious hand. It is said that this will attract more business later.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that growing vegetables to supply the city is a way to get rich. But in this situation, the vegetable vendors in the small vegetable markets cannot sell vegetables at a good price. How can the farmers get rich? Look, customers only come when the vegetable price is a dozen or twenty coppers per catty. If it is fifty or sixty wen per liang, then the customers will grumble, "Vegetables are selling at the price of meat," and go to the tofu stall to buy "white horse meat" without turning their heads. Although in the past, there was no worry about no one patronizing if it was a seasonal delicacy selling for ten cents a liang.</p>
<p>The fresh flowers on the flower stalls force a bitter smile at people, but most of them eventually fade and wither on the flower stalls, and are discarded.</p>
<p>Sitting at the Introduction Agency  Xian Xian</p>
<p>The countryside is bankrupt. The women in the countryside have all packed small bundles and come to Shanghai to work as "amah." The young and short ones work as "big sisters." The reason is that Mao Jianniang, who worked as an amah in Shanghai for three years, now wears a gold ring on her finger. A Bao, from the Shi Gen family, who worked as a big sister in Shanghai for half a year, now wears silk stockings on her feet.</p>
<p>Indeed, in Shanghai, from south to north, almost every street has an average of at least one shop with a sign that says "Gusu × Old Introduction Agency," "Ning Shao Old Introduction Agency," or "Weiyang × Ji Introduction Agency." And the benches in each introduction agency are always filled with amahs and big sisters waiting to be hired.</p>
<p>However, "sitting at the introduction agency" is said not to be easy. You have to pay for room and board for every day you sit there. A large number of amahs and big sisters are imported from the countryside. Unfortunately, Shanghai is also experiencing a recession. At least half of the ten households are tightening their belts and laying off employees. How can they absorb so many amahs and big sisters?</p>
<p>A mahs and big sisters sit at the introduction agency, emptying their pockets to pay for room and board. Once their pockets are empty, they have to pack their small bundles again and return to their hometown. As a result, those sitting in the introduction agencies are all unfamiliar faces.</p>
<p>Out of ten people sitting at the introduction agency, one is occasionally hired. Then they are busy finding a guarantor and paying the introduction fee. Those who are not hired look on with envy, but those who have found a job still complain about their fate, because they have ended up with a poor employer, who is worthless. But those who cannot even find a poor employer have to sit in the introduction agency all day, sighing with their necks craned.</p>
<p>The dirt of Shanghai is inexhaustible.</p>
<p>A Record of the Tai Chi Exercise Class Performance  Nangong Sheng</p>
<p>Last summer, the Ministry of Education, with Mr. Chu Minyi's promotion of Tai Chi exercise, organized a physical education class, with Tai Chi exercise as a subject, which was taught by Chu himself. Various places competed to imitate this. The Shanghai Physical Education Class Alumni Association also organized a Tai Chi Exercise Research Association, and elected Shen Baolun, Gu Shunhua, Ruan Weicun, Jiang Jicheng, and Li Shiwu as committee members. There were more than 20 members in total. They successively responded to invitations from various schools in Shanghai to serve as voluntary teachers. In recent days, it has become increasingly developed, resulting in an insufficient number of people to assign. Therefore, they cooperated with the Chinese Sports Association to establish a Tai Chi Exercise Class in order to popularize it. The class site was set up at Wanzhu Primary School in the city and at the original site of the Dongxinqiao Research Association in the French Concession. Chu was still the instructor. Since the opening, it has been quite effective. The day before yesterday, Chu came to Shanghai from Beijing and held a lecture class performance at Wanzhu. Many guests attended, including Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Education Bureau, Xu Zhiyi, Secretary-General of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and Zhao Shouchun, Tai Chi Quan teacher of the National Arts Branch. Xu and Zhao were both students of Wu Jianquan, the first famous Tai Chi Quan master, and were Chu's fellow disciples. The Tai Chi Exercise Class of the Liangjiang Women's Physical Education Normal School also attended the performance. First, Chu gave a speech on the effects and practice methods of Tai Chi exercise and demonstrated the techniques. After taking a group photo, the Tai Chi exercise class of the Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School performed, with coordinated movements. After the exercise, an old man and a ten-year-old child performed Tai Chi Quan, which was very exquisite and worth seeing. Then the lecture class performed. A physical education teacher from Jiaotong University gave commands. All 40 or so members were able to move within the scope, which was no easy task. Chu also planned to invite Xu and Zhao to perform Tai Chi pushing hands, but it was thought that it was already late. The meeting started at 8:00 PM and had lasted until after 12:00 AM, so it could not be performed. It could only be waited for the next meeting.</p>
<p>Chatter: Misunderstandings of the New Life Movement  Yu Youqing</p>
<p>Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek advocated the New Life Movement, it can be said that when he climbed to a high place and shouted, the mountains responded. At a time when the four dimensions were not upheld, restoring our country's inherent virtues was also a matter of prescribing the right medicine, but many ignorant and uneducated people were easily misunderstood, often using the New Life Movement as a guise and propaganda tool. This kind of malpractice may be inevitable!</p>
<p>Like a few days ago in Suzhou, I don't know which temple fair had a pair of flags in the ceremonial guard that read: "Support the New Life Movement" and "Success in the Revolutionary Cause," as if they knew the importance of the New Life and the Revolution. However, behind them, a hundred forbidden signs were written: "One Forbidden the Three People's Principles." Isn't this too ridiculous? At the same time, there were also five-colored national flags, which was even more absurd.</p>
<p>My hometown, Changshu, held a dragon boat race on June 6th. Is it a variation of the rural dragon boat race? Please forgive me for being a guest in another place, and I don't know the inside story, but their announcement was published in the newspaper and was quite grand, with a few words: "At a time when the New Life Movement is progressing by leaps and bounds, all competitive games that can sharpen and promote, and invigorate the spirit, are in line with propriety, justice, integrity, and shame. . . " It seems that the New Life Movement is again being used as a guise.</p>
<p>There are also other places, such as dragon lantern performances, etc., that are all labeled with the New Life Movement, but the facts are completely the opposite. Isn't this a misunderstanding of the true meaning of the New Life Movement?</p>
<p>Compatriots! See clearly the goal, recognize the direction, don't close your eyes and blindly make a fuss.</p>
<p>New Life and New Drinks  Zhan Lu</p>
<p>All aspects of Chinese life are constantly controlled by imported goods, whether material or spiritual. Materially, we discard our national treasures and only admire imported goods. As a result, money flows out, and China's economy goes bankrupt. Spiritually, we discard our national treasures and only indulge in the radical doctrines of imported goods. As a result, people's hearts and morals are declining day by day, and China's morality goes bankrupt. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's advocacy of the New Life Movement is out of concern that economic and moral bankruptcy is imminent and that we must vigorously seek ways to save it. When he climbed to a high place and shouted, people responded from all directions. The New Life Movement thus has the appearance of rising clouds and mists.</p>
<p>Since we speak of a new life, there should be new manners. Since we speak of new manners, there should be new drinks. Of the four dimensions mentioned by Guanzi, propriety is the first, and the embodiment of propriety is actually drinks. Observe any family: when they hear that a guest has arrived, they must offer them a drink. Drinks are divided into tea and wine. Those who are generally infatuated with Europeanization use coffee to replace China's fragrant tea and champagne and brandy to replace China's mellow wine. How can we discard our national treasures to such an extent? Since the implementation of the New Life Movement, the practice of offering coffee to guests has gradually been reformed, but the mellow wine used to entertain guests still has to rely on imported drinks. Some people criticize this and say: "It's not that I don't know how to love the country, but I regret that there are no corresponding domestic products to replace them."</p>
<p>Alas! Is this really said out of sincerity? If so, then the quality of the Yantai beer produced domestically is superior to that of imported products. Moreover, it is completely operated by Chinese businessmen, and its reputation for more than ten years has long been well-known. Using it to entertain guests shows that you treat people with a patriotic heart. Using it to entertain yourself shows that you treat yourself with a patriotic heart. Only in this way can you talk about a new life and new manners. Here is a lightly compiled Three Character Classic to praise new drinks:</p>
<p>There is beer, made in Yantai. The packaging is beautiful, and the price is ingenious. The quality is good, and the taste is good. To entertain guests, pour fine wine. Or to entertain yourself, drink agate. What is there to say about imported goods? The new life lies in manners. New manners lie in drinks. New drinks, made in Yantai. Remember the brand name, double-headed bird.</p>
<p>The Northeast Fourth Company Commander  Zhang Henshui, Chapter 13</p>
<p>Watching the Wailing Go, Bury Their Heads to Defend the Territory, Bullets Pierce Strong Arms, Sprinkling Blood to Stain the Lonely City</p>
<p>He thought that in such a dark night, if he lit a fire, it would attract the enemy's attention, so he reached out his hand to dissuade the smoker. He was standing here, wondering how to dispel this feeling of depression in his heart. Suddenly, a messenger came and said that the battalion commander ordered Company Commander Yin to retreat to the fort within twenty minutes. Yin Deren was very unhappy when he heard this order. He had encouraged his brothers and prepared to give the enemy a good thrashing when they arrived. Now that he hadn't even seen a shadow of the enemy, he had to retreat to the fort, which would inevitably reduce his morale. But the battalion commander's order could not be disobeyed, so he suppressed his anger and led his entire company of brothers into the fort reluctantly. As soon as they entered the fort, the battalion commander gave another order to block the fort gate and immediately go up to the city to defend against the enemy. Yin Deren didn't know what assurance the battalion commander had for this arrangement, but he followed the order first. Sure enough, as soon as he went up to the fort wall, there was a burst of machine gun fire from the east gate, and at the same time, a flash of fire appeared about two kilometers outside the city and also fired at the city wall. Yin Deren shouted: "Good boys, they're here." So he held the fort wall with both hands and peered out of the city. The enemy was firing outside the east gate, but there was no movement at the west, north, and south gates. He thought to himself that the enemy was also launching a stealthy attack. It was a pity that he wasn't outside the city, otherwise, he could have killed a bunch of them with a surprise attack. While thinking this, he turned his head and listened outward. He focused all his attention and seemed to hear some movement from the first trench. He guessed that the enemy would have some difficulty crossing the second and third trenches and would hesitate there for a while. That would be an opportunity to shoot. He took a machine gun from a soldier, placed it in the loophole, estimated the distance, leaned half his body, hid behind the fort wall, and stared ahead with his big eyes in the darkness. (415)</p>

<p>Free Talk: "Psychological Description"  Mu Mutian</p>
<p>Literature should be the depiction of people, the depiction of human society, which no one will deny. Balzac created his "Human Comedy." We who live in modern times should also create our era's Human Comedy. However, people have their desires, their demands, their emotions, and their psychological reactions. Of course, psychological description is a very important technique when describing people. This is also something no one will deny.</p>
<p>Psychological description is naturally one of the techniques of realism. A great writer must be a psychologist. A correct understanding of people is not only to know their appearance but also to know their inner selves. In this way, psychological description in works has important significance. However, if a writer wants to create psychological descriptions of characters, he must put in the effort to dissect and analyze the psychology of real people. To not conduct objective psychological dissection and analysis of characters, but to subjectively, fictitiously, use fantasy to fabricate the psychology of characters is a violation of reality. That kind of psychological description is what we want to attack.</p>
<p>In present-day China, what is developed is not psychological dissection but a kind of excretion of the state of mind. What the author wants to depict is not the psychology of objective characters becoming characteristic features, but to reveal a kind of cloud-like thing temporarily floating in their own hearts through a few fictional characters. I call this kind of psychological description without reality or not very realistic sentimentalism. I believe that if psychological dissection starts from a realistic attitude, sentimentalism starts from an aesthetic attitude. The author's attitude toward life is an important question. Psychological description based on scientific psychological dissection is what we want to affirm.</p>
<p>However, what we must pay close attention to is that psychological dissection is not everything in the technique of realistic description. Striving towards the "psychological novel" is not permissible. Man is a social animal; man is an acting animal. Human behavior and human life are complex. Except in a few situations, psychology is expressed through action. It can also be said that psychological description, in most situations, is reflected through physiological description. It is acceptable to regard psychological dissection as a supplementary technique, but to regard it as everything in the technique will cause many ills. What the writer should pay attention to is the human behavior of social life.</p>
<p>In terms of character expression, indirect description is much more effective than direct description. But this does not deny that direct description is sometimes necessary. Psychological dissection should not be a long, monologue-style self-analysis or a dialogue-style philosophical debate. Naturally, monologue-style self-analysis and dialogue-style philosophical debate, when used appropriately, can be effective. However, it is also not good for psychological dissection to become a thesis-style report. The psychological novels of the late nineteenth century Western Europe - naturally, that was a reaction against naturalism - if we read them in detail, don't we feel the emptiness in them? For example, Bourget's novels are just a kind of psychological formulaism. If we leave the vast social life and the broad human</p>

<p>Movie Supplement, The China Press, 22nd Day of the 6th Month of the 23rd Year of the Republic of China, Friday</p>
<p>Men Make Movies, Women Watch (Middle) A Glimpse of the Prevalence of Male Power When Women Occupied a Negligible Position</p>
<p>Bess was a very observant person. She asked about each of the important staff members in the photography studio, one by one: the set designer, the photographer, the lighting technician, the technician, and so on. However, she was disappointed to discover that all the workers in the various photography studios were men. Aside from the actresses, there was not a single woman occupying an important working position. Even the dressmakers and makeup artists, jobs that people usually think women are better at, were all men. The clothes of Ms. Hopkins, Ms. Colbert, Ms. Dietrich, and others were all made by men. Some people say that women like to wear clothes made by men because men design clothes for women in accordance with men's psychology. Isn't the reason women dress fashionably mostly for men to see? However, some people also say that women dress for other women to see. We won't argue about this here, but it is a fact that the dressmakers at various Hollywood companies are all men. In Hollywood photography studios, all the work, from top to bottom, is done by men. Even the actresses' makeup and hair are done by men. Warner Brothers has sixteen barbers and six makeup artists, but they are all men, not a single woman. Bess was a little anxious when she heard this. She asked, "Then, in terms of the administrative aspects of film production, do women have any role at all?" George thought for a long time and said, "Yes. At Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, there is Ms. Bucknell, who specializes in research. At 20th Century Fox, there is Ms. Kaufman, who is the head of the costume department. In addition, there are many female employees in each company who are film editors, recorders, secretaries, typists, and waitresses." Bess thought to herself, "So that's all there is to it." She recalled that women occupy important positions in many other professions. In the aviation industry, there is Amelia Earhart. Mrs. Lindbergh also kept pace with her husband. Helen Wills and Miss Jacobs were leading figures on the tennis court. Miss Perkins even served as chairwoman of the National Labor Relations Board. In the writing world, there are... female swimmers, female explorers, female missionaries, and famous women who have drowned in the ocean. But there are none in the film industry! Furthermore, when it comes to female stars, their position in the film industry is even more lamentable. Their relationship to film production can be said to be like wax figures in shop windows. Their entry into the film industry is also personally selected by men, whether it is the stage director, the local producer, or other powerful senior staff. As for the stars themselves, they have no say. In the silent film era, they had no voice, but even in the sound era, they still have no voice except for the lines and songs that are given to them, and even those songs and lines are written for them by men. Of course, there are also a few female writers in Hollywood whose screenplays have been adopted by the studios. But these are rare occurrences. In the usual course of events, the making of a movie starts with a gagman (there is no gagwoman) who comes up with a good idea, which he tells a writer (male). The writer turns it into a story, which is sent to a producer (male). The producer looks at it and sends it to a director (male). That director sends the story to a continuity writer (male), who writes the screenplay and sends it to the dialogue writer (male). The dialogue writer finishes it and sends it back to the director to be used as the script for filming. When filming, the photographer is male, the editor is male, the company's distributor is male, and the rental agent is also male. But when the movie is shown in the theater, if you look at the audience, most of them are women. According to reliable statistics, women account for 81.07%, or 82%, of the total audience. Therefore, it can be said that movies are entertainment products made entirely by men, while the audience is mostly women. Isn't this a strange thing? (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Film Review: "Professional Sweetheart"</h3>
<p>Commentary by Yi Jun</p>
<p>(Showing in Nanjing)</p>
<p>It doesn't depict the professionalization of romance between men and women as I had imagined, where love is bought and sold with material goods. However, "Professional Sweetheart" can be said to be more sophisticated than the average silly movie, although there is still a lot of pointless slapstick. "Professional Sweetheart" tells the story of a radio singer who is restless in her job because she needs a male companion, so she breaks her contract. The businessmen at the radio company then discuss a plan to choose an ideal sweetheart for her. Finally, he satisfies her, and they live together in a remote village. But they become restless and, in the end, re-sign the contract, and the lovers come back to broadcasting together. As for the story, it is still the same old depiction of love between men and women, and in the end, it is still the same old happy ending. However, the portrayal of the merchants' ugly behavior in "Professional Sweetheart," the loss of freedom after signing the contract, the lack of morality, and John's words to his wife in the remote countryside, "Look at your hands, they are so soft, not wrinkled at all, not doing any work, just smoking and drinking... You are a bad woman!" It is these extremely slight ironies that make "Professional Sweetheart" somewhat worth watching. Beyond that, there is nothing else to find in "Professional Sweetheart." If there is anything else, it is at most the novelty of using the romance of a radio singer as the subject matter. The director's technique is very concise, and some transitions are commendable, such as the opening, which transitions from wireless telephone to broadcasting. As for the several revolving shots (P.S.) when John and Glory drive into the countryside, they are also very clever. However, the consistent flatness of the story of "Professional Sweetheart," with no climax, no stimulation, coupled with lengthy dialogue, too many phone calls and broadcasts, the economical director's technique, Ginny Rogers' singing, and the slapstick of several comedians, cannot reduce the audience's feeling of boredom and dullness. Ginny Rogers plays the role very successfully here. Her innocent and unrestrained demeanor is somewhat reminiscent of Irene Dunne. Norman Foster, who plays John, is only mediocre.</p>
<h3>Review of "The Shoe-Polish King"</h3>
<p>Paris</p>
<p>About three months ago, the Cathay Grand Theater showed a French film translated as "Street Angel." In that film, the playwright had a street vagrant, by chance, mix into the group of noble people, fully carrying out the task of a clown, making the gentlemen and ladies laugh heartily. Later, the vagrant accidentally made a fortune, and after a happy marriage, he had changed from a vagrant to a gentleman. Now, "The Shoe-Polish King" is almost a remake of "Street Angel." This is not only because the producer or leading actor is the same person, but also because the content of the story is roughly similar. Like "Street Angel," the protagonist's name here is also Bob. He makes a living shining shoes for people at the train station and later becomes a bus driver. By chance, he goes to a very luxurious theater to see a play. By chance, he is mistaken for a prince and has an affair with an actress. He makes a lot of trouble in high society. Again, by chance, he wins a lot of money. So, just like "Street Angel," he marries his lover and is reunited with her. It is very obvious that the playwright uses the identity of a "scoundrel" to make a big scene and shout loudly among noble people, expressing his intention to ridicule and satirize. People of humble origins do not understand the etiquette of gentlemen and ladies. They only do what they want and act as they please. He spanks the ladies' behinds, he tears the ladies' underwear, but people think he is the god of happiness and are happy because of his insults. So he fulfills the duty of a clown. He makes the gentlemen and ladies happy, and he is also happy himself, so he finally climbs to the upper class and ultimately obtains a complete and happy result. We cannot think that this is a progressive work. The screenwriter is caught up in a reckless pursuit of happiness, and he doesn't even feel the slightest sadness about the brilliance of the lives of the people in his own class. But is it still permissible to sing the praises of a peaceful and prosperous world in works of art now? Great artists with a correct worldview cannot deceive themselves and cover up reality in this way. In terms of technique, I think that soft-hearted people will again regard it as a great work because it has humorous jokes and slapstick, which is very suitable for their criteria for criticizing films. Their motto is that films do not talk about ideology, especially comedies, as long as they are "light and humorous, they are first-class films." But we think that this "Shoe-Polish King" is not of much value, regardless of whether it has a slightly satirical tone. On the other hand, if we compare this "Shoe-Polish King" with "Street Angel," then it is very obvious that the former is not as good as the latter. "Street Angel" has a very bright and unrestrained style, a fast tempo melody, and happy singing voices, which can show that the director has unique skills. From beginning to end, he does not make the audience feel the slightest boredom. But in this "Shoe-Polish King," we admit that the director has indeed put a lot of effort into the stage scenes, but for other points, such as the advantages of "Street Angel," they cannot all be found here. Especially the particularly excessive places are even more annoying. Georgius Malton is a comedic genius. He has excellent skills, especially his singing, which makes people feel happy. However, he has not yet reached the point of perfection. He has many excessive exaggerations, and like the director, he uses the comedic material that Hollywood is used to here without getting tired of it, which becomes a defect in his acting skills.</p>
<h3>Is a Sequel to "Sister Flowers" Necessary?</h3>
<p>Ru Lai Sheng</p>
<p>The domestic film "Sister Flowers" was able to create a surprising record, which people have watched hundreds of times without getting tired of it, and its praise has not waned, so it has its own unique points. Zheng Zhengqiu's direction is especially able to give people a deep stimulus, touching the heartstrings of the audience. However, if Hu Die had not played the key role, it would have been difficult to have such a sharp and delicate performance. The combination of both is naturally a masterpiece. However, in my humble opinion, since this film is such a great success, there should be a sequel. Otherwise, the rescue of Da Bao and his mother will still depend on Jian Ying's power. Although Jian Ying was moved by Da Bao, Jian Ying ultimately discovers his conscience in this way to restore his innocence, and the three mother and son die at the same time. Where do they ultimately go? This is what the general audience is eager to know. Jian Ying relies on money and power, although he has not committed any evil deeds, but he has relied on his power to bully others, and his poor elder sister has actually been humiliated by him. Now that he has repented, there should be a practical expression of it. Therefore, I think that "Sister Flowers" should have a sequel.</p>
<h3>"Wan Hua Tuan" Filmed into a Movie</h3>
<p>Xiao Fan</p>
<p>The "Wan Hua Dance Troupe," which performed in Carlton, was greatly appreciated by Chinese and foreign people when it performed there, and the price was as high as six yuan. Tianyi Company, admiring the troupe's superb artistry, negotiated with the troupe leader, Ma Jiashi, to film the most exciting programs in the troupe's repertoire into a sound film. At the same time, Tianyi female stars Ye Qiuxin, Fan Xuepeng, Wang Huijuan, Lu Lixia, etc., also made guest appearances in the film. The film has now been approved by the Film Censorship Committee and will be released at the Beijing Grand Theater after "Mr. Wang."</p>
<h3>Movie Novel: Where Sinners Meet (1)</h3>
<p>Mei Sheng</p>
<p>Produced by RKO Radio Pictures of America丨Starring Diana Wynyard, etc.</p>
<p>Anne Ang thought that this matter was really strange, that her and Leonard's elopement would stop midway. They had planned it in advance to cross the English Channel to France together, but before reaching Dover, the car suddenly broke down. Leonard's chauffeur, Sanders, suggested that he knew a "hotel-like" place where they could stay temporarily. Although Anne and Leonard were unwilling, the sky was getting dark, and they had no choice but to follow Sanders. Anne was especially annoyed. She was unwilling to live with Leonard in England, especially since he was a married man. This simply made everything more complicated and turned into a boring stalemate. If they could have followed their original plan and crossed the sea to France that night... She began to gradually suspect Leonard's ability to handle things, in the midst of that extreme annoyance. They arrived at the "hotel," which was very strange, as if it had already known that they were coming. Dinner had already been prepared, with three seats laid out, and an unexpected host introduced himself as Mr. La Tiemo, and he insisted on calling Leonard by his first name, regardless of Leonard's opposition. During the meal, La Tiemo revealed that he was a very wealthy man. He also said that having money doesn't necessarily mean having authority, but it does have some influence. Because his whims led him to use his money and abuse his power, but it was to benefit others. And because he had everything, he could easily hear news that others could not easily hear. This time, he heard that there were a man and a woman on a risky marriage journey, so he used some small tricks to delay them for a few days, so that they could decide, when they were sober, whether they could live together happily forever. This was basically an absurd and unbelievable thing, to detain eloping lovers for a few days. But now, after a few days of forced consideration, after a few days of looking at Leonard in the comparative light of someone like La Tiemo, in that situation that she could not control, she actually doubted how she could have run away with Leonard in the first place. Of course, she remembered the origin of this matter. La Tiemo, it seemed, also had his mysterious methods to know the ins and outs of the matter. She was a woman living in seclusion, and her only companion was her elderly father, who was also a hard worker and did not care about family matters. Therefore, she was ignorant of the outside world and of life. Suddenly, she met this Leonard. She was extremely grateful because Leonard praised her with a few good words. She felt that she had fallen in love with him, too late, until she discovered that he was a married man. Her thoughts were confused, and she completely lost her mind. In addition, Leonard was an eloquent and charming man. He told her that his wife, Udacia, would soon divorce him, and they could get married at that time. In this way, a woman who was inexperienced in the world agreed to run away, not wanting problems to arise halfway before reaching Dover. At that time, Anne still thought that they could continue forward tomorrow morning, regardless of whether La Tiemo blocked them or not. Not wanting Leonard, probably also fell into La Tiemo's trick, or was fooled by his servants, Leonard caught a cold that night. Anne could not help but be a little angry, but Leonard actually got sick, and he complained about himself that he would not go. This was of course what La Tiemo wanted. Anne cursed in her heart: "Leonard is the kind of person who is willing to be fooled and humiliated by La Tiemo and doesn't want to leave that place!" (To be continued)</p>
