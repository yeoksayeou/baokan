<p>廷</p>
<p>我國烟禍本導源於洋商鴉片戰後毒燄高張遺害之深宜無以復加矣不謂近數年來嗎啡高根海洛因紅丸金丹等麻醉品亦竟遍地充斥其傳毒範圍且遠過於鴉片而溯其淵源又什九由歐美日本非法運入者今日欲圖烟禍肅淸固有賴於國際合作而遏絕麻醉品蔓延更非我國單方所能爲力事實證明從事於斯業者多爲託庇於治外法權及租界警權下之宵小無賴其私運方法亦復層出不窮或則委託懸掛洋旗之輪船負責輸送或則冒充普通性質之信件由郵投遞其尤黠者且置製造機於一葉扁舟行蹤飄忽秘製密售由是毒氛瀰漫不可收拾</p>
<p>顧以時勢之推移國際關係日益密切人道觀念發達逾恒中國之鴉片與麻醉品問題乃漸具國際面目而爲舉世所關切遠在一九一二年時已有中日英美荷蘭等十二國議定國際鴉片公約於海牙約中兼有限制嗎啡高根及其化合質料之規定而對於在華佔有租界租借地殖民地之締約各國更諄諄叮囑應負嚴禁私運之責惜當時具體辦法仍付闕如誠意履行者蓋寥寥也一九二五年國聯禁烟顧問委員會爲推行海牙公約計復訂有日内瓦禁烟公約而内容依然失之空泛直至一九三一年「國際限制製造及調節分配麻醉藥品公約」成立始有具體方案可資遵循是約自去年七月九日起發生效力而我國甫於本年一月十日正式批准蓋因處境特殊不得不愼重考慮也</p>
<p>尤可慰者國聯鴉片顧問委員會最近又通過我國提案並經行政院採納照會在華享有治外法權各國實行下列辦法</p>
<p>（一）各該國人民在華參與私製或私運麻醉藥者。應將其驅逐出境。不准復返中國。</p>
<p>（二）各該國應制定法律。對各國人民在華私運烟藥或參與私製麻醉藥者。决定處刑。</p>
<p>（三）在華航行之各國船隻。如經查獲係供私販烟藥之用者。應即撤銷保護。</p>
<p>觀此三點内容扼要苟能與一九三一年公約相輔而行寗不大佳然吾人默察現狀仍不敢遽抱樂觀一則以國聯行政院關於國際經濟的社會的事業之建議在法律上缺乏强制各國遵行之權力能否實行實行至何程度皆屬疑問再則以脫盟之日本對於國聯之决議必不肯隨衆附和而况一九三一年公約日本亦迄未參加苟日本而繼續獨行其是則高談中外合作禁毒直爲廢詞而已三則以我國之海岸綫冗長異常緝私綦難陸路邊境偷運更易厚利所在人所共趨防禦疏忽何事不爲四則以上海一隅政出多門而夙爲鴉片及其餘麻醉品轉運之總匯其販賣行棧多設租界取締費力蓋若輩關節靈通一旦遇警漏網至易在此五難之下今後中外合作禁毒之前途如何可以思過半矣</p>
<p>雖然因噎廢食雖下愚不爲而况禁毒事業關係整個民族之生死存亡更當抖擻精神果敢以行詎可畏難中止今旣有此國聯决議道義上助我良多允宜積極致力於正常外交之折衝國際輿論之鼓吹雙管齊下並行不悖日本雖不受一九三一年公約之束縛而其在一九一二年海牙公約下之義務固不容輕易抹殺若僞滿毒品之入關灤東毒氛之充斥福建日台僑民販賣烟藥之跋扈鐵證具在責任分明無論日本有無悔禍之誠意吾人總應嚴重詰問以盡我救亡圖存之天職他如滇越間之私販情形聞亦嚴重滇緬邊境之騰永一帶邊民無知受人愚弄時時因我方禁烟而發生潛移界樁之事南洋英荷法葡各屬殖民地鴉片公賣縱容華僑自由吸烟以搜括巨額烟稅之收入凡此事實亦當分别向關係國政府交涉以求滿意之解决</p>
<p>至於我國本身將如何以執行公約規定之義務如何以推進拒毒工作之實施如何以輔助他國好意之合作則胥有賴於禁烟委員會等政府機關與夫重要國民團體之共同努力再接再厲期底於成庶幾外人對我不復有冷嘲熱諷之藉口而我出席國際禁烟會議之代表亦不再爲冷酷無情之統計表所窘迫也</p>

<p>張氏昨向申時社記者、發表此次在贛考察磁業情形云、本人此次在贛、曾對江西磁業加以注意、該省磁業、最近因種種原因、已入極度衰落之狀態、其主要之原因、由於做磁坯者與燒窰及原料供給三者、均不相爲謀、致造成其衰敗之内在主要原素、按如景德鎭等各著名磁器出産地、其做坯者、大抵爲小本經營、資本多不過二三百元、既未受磁業之敎育、又無美術智識、及市塲需要等之研究、更不知一切科學方法之利用、而經營窰業者、亦多因近來磁業受外貨壓迫、日趨不振、委託燒磁之客戸、日見减少、致不得不受托燒者之要挾、必至數滿一窰時、方肯開窰、以致做磁坯者必須久候、方可得貨、不能以迅速之方法、以應市面之需要、</p>
<h3 id="c176">出品成本增高 <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>且窰戸只知减低燃料、並設法盡量增高窰之高度、期能多收磁坯、以圖多利、因之所燒之磁坯、損壞極易、質地亦劣、而窰戸方面、不但不予賠償、反而不將燒費退還所托燒磁坯者、平均每百件貨物、需預備四十件備損傷、因之成本愈大、貨物自隨之增貴、以之與科學化低價之外貨磁品相競爭、自無法抗衡、而漸趨於淘汰、</p>
<h3 id="c177">工人風氣不良 <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>江西省爲産生磁器原料之區、其區内所有産量、大部爲當地土豪所把持、盡量抬高其價值、因故做磁坯者、不能獲得善價之原料、以减輕其貨值、此外贛省所有之磁器工人、因平素缺乏規律之修養與訓練、類多遊蕩不拘、風氣殊壞、工作效能、亦隨之日見减退、而整個中國磁業前途、乃至危機叢生、</p>

<p>欲圖改良江西磁業、首先須有良善之地方官吏、澈底整頓地方風氣、糾正磁業工人之惡習、以增加其生産力、同時對於原料價格、窰戸把持、尤需急謀解决、積極方面、需有專門智識者、訓練一班新式之磁業工作人員、改善窰戸技能、努力提倡改革、前途方可有希望、現江西省當局、已聘請杜重遠先生組織九江磁業公司、省府已允撥欵二十萬元、以爲提倡、商股由政府予以餘息、至景德鎭方面磁業之改良與救濟、亦已由全國經濟委員會負責提欵、助其發展、俾謀我國磁業之復興云</p>

<p>答袁慶炎君</p>
<p>這是非常普遍的現象，我們萬分同情袁君及其他處於同一境遇的朋友，這種「煩悶」是時代的，是每個現代青年不可避免的要感受的。即令你不翻閱任何書籍，你在生活的苦難中也自然遲早會感到。袁君這種煩悶似乎證明了越有知識反越痛苦的話是對的，其實，愚昧不知，反是眞的痛苦，眞的痛苦實在也無法逃避，知道痛苦的根由了，我們想法子克服這根由就是實不必怕它，也不必爲它煩悶，煩悶又有何用處呢？所以袁君的煩悶，與讀不讀書實在没有多大關係。</p>
<p>雖然，我們同情袁君的煩悶的根由，我們却不敢同意袁君的態度，並且不得不指出袁君這種態度有點好像逃避現實，因爲這確是一般青年目前容易犯的錯誤，我們不能不公開的與大家來討論，希望犯有同樣錯誤的人趕快自己來改正。</p>
<p>一般的說，青年人往往有點近於感情用事，不能看見社會的醜惡。因爲他的純樸的頭腦，認眞的態度，缺乏生活的經騐，求急的心情，常常使他容易忿怒，容易失望，祇有熱情，没有耐性。對於每一件事，起初總是熱心過急，希望太奢，祇想一帆風順，指日可成。</p>
<p>同時把自己的力量估計得太大，没有看見客觀的現實，於是，一切希望，一切企圖，都變成懸在空中的幻想，不切實際。自然他必然到處要碰釘子，霉頭。當釘子碰者太厲害，霉頭觸得太大時，就不免急流勇退，使他心灰意懶。意志脆　弱的人，或者就與醜惡同流合汚了，或者沉醉在性愛，或某種享樂中去了，不敢再打開眼睛看世界。那些不甘墮落而又不能與實踐答拍調的人，自然要陷於極度矛盾的痛苦中，他的腦裏時時在鬥爭，在苦惱，因爲它離開實踐季，他的思想只在幻想中開展，弄得與守際一天天隔離，變成了只知說大話，發神經，與你的周圍的人都對不來頭，一切生活都不感覺有味，不愛做事，不想做事，甚至於感覺天下竟没有可以與自己談話的人，没有人可以與自己共同做事，對於一切的人發生仇恨，懷欵　，拒絶人家的一切友愛，將自己一天天往孤獨趕，使自己的生活範圍一天天縮小，縮到牛角尖裏去。結果是大家見了你都害怕，喊你做瘋子，弄到這步田地後，你如果不恍然覺悟結果可以走到發狂，瘋癲，或自殺。如果自己回想昔日對社會的熱情，不是完全相反嗎？如果問問自己，你忿怒了一生，連自己的生命都犧牲了，對於社會有何補益呢？我想這回答一定要痛心，現在那能說補益，祇可說在旁的方面反帮助了社會的醜惡罷了。</p>
<p>這裏，袁君不要多心，因爲，我們這封回信，不是給袁君一人讀的，袁君的病症還不如上面說的那般深，只要袁君翻然改正，袁君有的還是非常可樂觀的前途。現在且言歸正傳來談袁君對於職業的態度罷！（未完）</p>

<p>本市黨部及市敎育局、於昨日下午二時、在務本女子中學大禮堂、召集全市公私立中等學校訓育主任及公民黨義敎師舉行談話會、由市黨部陶委員市敎局潘局長指示訓育方針、兹誌詳情如次、</p>
<p>出席人數　出席者除市黨部常委陶百川、黨義敎育股總幹事喻仲標、市敎局長潘公展、科長陳白外、計到務本·敬業·洋涇·吳淞·南商·君毅·民立·濱海·民光·培明·愛羣·愛國·新陸·澄衷·光夏·曁南·市北·新亞·正誼·華東·上中·浦東·道中、慈航等八十餘校訓育主任公民敎員朱亞揆·王龍章·許性初·徐則驤·周世輔·李崇樸·張詠春·金月章·黄達平·陳光虞·王學權等百餘人、</p>
<p>主席報告　首由主席陶百川報告、略謂黨義敎師訓育主行所負的使命很大、與黨部的關係尤爲密切蓋一般敎員未必都是黨員、而訓育主任及公民敎員則都是本黨同志、但過去黨部方面未曾召集過各位同志、使互相聯絡、這是一個缺點、今後對於訓育主任黨義敎師想和黨部及敎局發生關係、故時常要召集各位來互相談談、交換意見、諸位對上海市中等敎育所負之使命非常重大、尤其在今日的中國、諸位領導中學生的責任更其重大、對於訓練學生我想我可以運用學生自治會之組織、但此刻的學生運動、與以前五四時代的不同、過去民衆運動、當然學生運動也包括在内、往往運動民衆來脫離本業、這是很大的毛病、今後的學生運動、絶對不能如此、學生自治會之組織、是要根據三民主義來訓練、學生在學校内之自治生活、並促其智德體羣之發展、訓育主任即可以運用學生自治會之組織來訓練學生、同時希望各位第一要瞭解自己的責任、第二要充實對於工作上應具備的智識、並修養人格、才能使工作勝任愉快云、</p>
<p>局長訓話　次潘局訓話略謂、（一）在上海中等學校的訓育方針應有一個共同的趨向、無論對學生是嚴格或者是放任、蓋敎育事業不是一二人的私人事業、故學校縱然有公私立之分、但學校所辦的事業則一、都是辦的與國家民族很有關係的敎育事業、任何學校的訓育主任及公民敎員其訓管學生奔走在一條路上、固然在敎育系統的階段上來分、小學中學與大學、因訓育的對象學生、其年齡各有限制、訓育的方法自然有不同、但在同一階段的中等學校、則一定要有共同的趨向、否則各校　嚴不同、其影響很大、此種應寛或應嚴的標凖、應徵求各位實際在訓練學生的同志的意鑡、（二）那末究竟我們的趨向應如何呢、依我個人的意鑡、凡是一種方針或趨向、不能不看到國家現在的環境、蓋無論何事總逃不掉時間與空間、故要定中等學校階段的訓育趨向、即不能抹煞中國的現在的環境、現在的中國正像一所四圍着了火的房子、裏面的人誰都有燒死的危險、現在不是要我們大家入火坑、是已經在火坑裏、應如何設法來救出火坑、敎育是在許多救國中間的根本的救國方法、胡適这曾經說過、敎育大家說破産、但是要救破産的國家、還是靠敎育、所以敎育界人士應多負責任、中等敎育在此時空之間、我們不能使學生放任自由、學生運動自五四以來成爲很好的名詞、但自九一八·一二八兩個重大打擊、已顯出我們的學生没有毅力而只有衝動、這是不能救國家的、現在一般頭腦冷靜些的學生都已覺悟到了、這是轉機的開始、此刻講學生運動、當然不能像五四時一樣、從前是破壞的工作、現在我們要建設了、故我們對中學生不能再放任、但在中學校裏訓練學校做學生運動、祗有訓育主任可以做、祇有公民敎員可以輔助訓育主任做、一切學生之行動、言論·思想·都要受訓育主任公民敎員的指導、訓育主任、公民敎員是受了黨和政府的委托來負此重大責任的、希望各位明白此點來訓練學生成一個將來能自救之人的份子、（三）現在許　學校的風潮、其責任分析起來、三分之一是學生負、三分之一是一部份挑動風潮的敎職員負、再有三分之一是自校長以下全體敎職員應該負、蓋學校自校長以下每個敎職員都不失職、那末學生就無懈可擊、訓育主任公民敎員來訓練學生就事半功倍、否則如學校本身各方面不健全、敎職員不盡職、那末訓育主任公民敎員就無法來訓練學生了、但各位即使遇到此種困難的環境、仍應努力去做、不過要取得校長的諒解、要校長也要負訓育之責、末了、更有一點很重要、訓育主任公民敎員不是掛名的差使不能兼職、要實際到學校裏去負責、現在普遍的病象即訓育主任公民敎員大都掛了名不去負責、這將使上海市中等學校的學生的訓管、全被訓育主任公民敎員葬送、以後敎育局要隨時派員到各校去調查、如遇這種不負責任的訓育主任公民敎員、一定不許他担任的、我們爲中學校計、爲中等敎育計、不能不救專責的人去負責云、</p>

<p>小朋友！我們要知道，現在是科學的世界，要是没有科學的國家，便難以生存在這世界裏頭：中國的科學，誰去創造呢？就是我們小朋友，把我們自己造成科學的孩子，也便是造成一個科學的中國。</p>
<p>科學家是和平常人不同的，他們不論遇到什麽一回事，總是抱着「爲什麽要這樣，究竟是怎樣……」的懷疑的態度；這些懷疑的問題，在他們的腦海中，一刻不停的盤旋着，非要研究到徹底才罷！</p>
<p>你看！美國的科學家富蘭克林他發明白色反射，黑色吸收的物理學，和牛頓所發明的蒸汽機，我想這些故事，大槪諸位小朋友也知道的，他們兩位科學家，都從這些疑問中才能夠發明，平常人所忽略的學理。</p>

<p>小朋友們都參加過校内或校外的考試吧？若是你的名次常在前列，自然是值得誇耀的。但若是名次落後、我勸你也不必自餒。我講兩個大人物的考試故事給你們聽：</p>
<p>拿破侖，法國的大英雄，在里昻中學舉行文藝奬金試騐，他在十六名考生中得了個第十五名。他却並不灰心，他依舊十分自負，他自信上帝之外就是他，後來果然成就了他的大野心。</p>
<p>張謇，前淸的狀元，民國時代的大實業家，十五歲時去考州試，名次取在一百以外。他的敎師大加呵責、說：「假使有一千人去考，要取九百九十九名，只有一個人不取，就是你！」他聽了十分氣悶，便在他的窗格上，帳頂上都寫着「九百九十九」五個字，發奮讀書。後來到底大魁天下。</p>

<p>前次，我曾介紹一位發明望遠鏡的小朋友給諸位，但，這是出於偶然，並没有什麽希罕，我現在再來介紹一位由研究而發明的小朋友給諸位，我想大家一定是樂聞的吧。</p>
<p>這位小發明家是德國人，名呌威布，比我大一歲—十六歲，是一個小學生，他在小時候就有科學的頭腦，時常想發明一件東西，貢獻世上，旁人總是笑他，但他並不因此而灰心，可是，有志者事竟成，於最近竟發明小電船同無綫電機，並且可以用無綫電力指揮該船，成績非常的好，得政府當局的嘉奬；和地方人士的贊許，現在他準備製造一隻較大的可以乘人的船，仍舊用無綫電力指揮，料想一定能獲得相當的成績。</p>

<p>— 汪瘦秋</p>
<p>在學校裏，不是也有日記嗎？但是那種日記，太不行了！不但每天都是這幾句話，就是寫的字，也是東倒西斜，大一個，小一個的。所以那種日記，再寫上一年兩年，也是没有什麽大用處的。</p>
<p>照上面這樣說起來，日記不是不用寫了嗎？這當然不對的，但是我主張寫日記要注意下面幾點：（一）字跡要端正：（二）叙事要詳明：（三）不能一日間斷；本來，寫日記的功用有三項：第一：每日所作所爲，均有記述，將來可資參考：第二：可以練習書法；第三：可以練習作文；因爲有這三種利益，所以日記就成爲人人不能缺少的一件工作。不過寫的方法，决不能像學校裏日記，那樣馬虎，如果像那種刻版式的寫法，當然收不到寫日記的效力了！</p>
<p>我相信，如果十歲以上的小朋友，能够每天不斷的寫日記，一直寫到他中學畢業以後，那他的文法，書法，一定會很好的，小朋友們！我願意你們就從今天起，來認眞的寫日記。現在，我再告訴你們日記的寫法：（一）日期；（二）天氣；（如果願寫星期幾的，可以寫在天氣之前。）（三）記事；（一天的事情，擇比較有價值的寫下來。）（四）感想；（對於某人，或某一件事的感想。）</p>

<p>— 林玲</p>
<p>我們常常在垃圾桶旁邊，看見一大堆一大堆半個半個的西瓜皮彀子，我們知道把這些東西用鹽醃過，晒乾，就成了很淸脆可口的食品，然而我們還没有知道這種東西，還可以做成一種很精巧的玩具呢。</p>
<p>吃西瓜的時候，我們要在一個瓜的三分之二的地方剖開，把三分之一的部份，剜瓤吃過棄去。然後再用匙剜出三分之二的這一部分的瓜瓤，細細刮盡，吃過以後，我們就可以開始製造我們的玩具—西瓜燈了。</p>
<p>我們用匙在瓜彀的裏面，揀可以刮去的地方，儘量刮去，要愈薄愈好，只要不損害到瓜的表皮上去。然後再用快刀，在瓜彀的外面一層黑色的表皮上，隨意刻劃上些山水人物，或是花卉草木之類。這裏我們應當注意的是每一條綫紋，都得把瓜皮的黑色的外層剜去。否則在瓜彀裏燃起燭來，外面的花紋，就變得糢糊了。</p>
<p>我們把瓜彀上的花紋，刻劃好以後，再在瓜的底心，鑽上一支釘，預備揷蠟燭，同時在瓜的周圍，絡上或條細繩，或是粗綫，繫在一根竹竿的一端，這樣把竹竿提起來，瓜彀也跟着起來，西瓜燈製造就完成了。</p>
<p>到晚上，我們在瓜彀裏的一支釘上揷上一支蠟燭，燃起火來，瓜皮上的花紋，給燭光映得淸淸楚楚，粗的粗，細的細，没有剜去的地方却是墨黑，我們提着，在夜裏的院子裏街道上田畔，河塘邊走着，又是多麽有趣呢！</p>

<p>— 一震</p>
<p>小翠鳥挾着翅膀，唱着歌飛出了家，快樂地向大空飛去；疲乏時，在這樹上停停，在那樹上歇歇。這種旅行它是最喜歡的。</p>
<p>「許」丨驀然一顆槍彈在它耳旁擦過，小翅膀上受了傷，它大喊一聲，直向下摜，恰巧跌在乾草堆裏，把身子藏了起來。不久，人的脚步聲在它耳旁經過了。爬了出來，他才看見自己的右翼上給彈子穿過，血流個不停，像泉水一樣。</p>
<p>「爲了這可惡的翅膀，幾乎送了我的性命，幸而自己還機警，假使没有翅膀，彈子只悄悄地在耳邊溜滑過了，不會有這危險……」小翠鳥正在想，恰巧一個仙女經過，於是它要求：</p>
<p>「好仙人，我討厭這翅膀，請你給我斬了吧！」</p>
<p>「眞的麽？眞不要它？」仙女温柔地說：「你後悔麽？」</p>
<p>「眞的！我决不後悔！」小翠鳥搖着頭說。</p>
<p>於是仙女把小翠鳥的翅膀收去了。</p>
<p>小翠鳥没有了翅膀，輕快得多，整天在麥田裏出進玩耍，倒也安樂。</p>
<p>一天，小翠鳥在田岸上閒眺，忽然看見一個孩子執着竹竿跑來，它立刻躱入田裏，這孩子却不肯放鬆，依舊追來，拿竹竿亂揍，「拍」的在它的腦門上着了一下，就此昏過去了，醒來，它才發現自己睡在籠裏，已消失了自由。</p>
<p>「唉！世界是没有累贅的東西，當時我有了兩隻翅膀，决不會發生這囚禁的事」想到這，它悲慘地哭了。</p>

<p>這是一件很值得記載的事。眞奇怪！在十個兒童之中倒有十個是喜歡檯球的。因爲它的玩法簡單，玩時有趣，而且有益於身體的健康；因此兒童之和檯球，簡直是日日不離念念不忘。他們是十分友愛的好伴侶！</p>
<p>但不幸事情的發生是不聽人指揮的。譬如有幾個小朋友在拍檯球，正在興緻濃厚的時候，忽然檯球被自己或大家搶奪而變成有缺陷了，那是多麽的没趣；拍起來凹凸不平，跳東跳西，好像一隻未曾馴服的野馬，一些不肯受自己的節制！然而不要緊，你可到老虎竈上買些沸水來，把檯球浸在水裏，隔不了幾分鐘，你可發見檯球的病是醫好了。</p>
<p>解釋　因爲檯球内所包含的是空氣，空氣受不了熱，一受了熱身體就要發胖起來，生出膨脹的現象。醫治檯球，就是利用這點小小的物理學。</p>

<p>鐵釘釘在木板上，若太長久了些，它便會牢牢的銹住。有時無論你怎樣的挖它或鉗它，終是一動也不動。不過假使你將鐵釘再釘進了些，然後再去挖它或鉗它，那就比較容易了。這是因爲它和鐵銹脫離了的緣故。</p>

<p>— 穆因</p>
<p>平湖縣本來是海鹽縣裏的一個鎭，起先的名字呌當湖鎭。後來因爲繁盛的關係，明朝才改稱平湖縣，和海鹽縣脫離了關係的。</p>
<p>小朋友們！這歷史我想一定有許多小朋友没有知道，所以我在這裏先把它述說了。現在我要講一叚平湖的民間傳說給你們聽。</p>
<p>當湖鎭在漢朝的時候，是一個很富庶的地方，居民向來安分守已，度他們快樂的日子。據說有一天那裏忽然來了一個將軍，頭戴軍冠，身穿軍服，騎了白馬，提了寳劍，在當湖鎭的四面跑了一個大圈子；後來一個圈子跑完了，他便止住馬用他手裏的劍，向這個圈子裏一指說道：「此地當爲湖。」他說完之後，回身加着鞭子又跑了，但是結果，就不知道他跑到什麽地方去了。</p>
<p>當時有些居民看見他的，都當他是瘋子，毫不介意。</p>
<p>可是在這天夜裏，忽然狂風暴雨，飛沙走石，閙了一整夜，到第二日大家起身開門一看，才不免驚訝起來。原來昨天那人環繞的圈子，現在都變成湖了！那個地方的人也都給水埋没的死了。</p>
<p>從此這個地方就呌當湖鎭。但是因爲它的湖水平穩，就稱它爲呌平湖了。</p>

<p>— 菱湖昭</p>
<p>小朋友，捉鳥這個玩意兒，的確是很有趣味的。你想一隻活潑而會唱歌的小鳥，給你捉獲了，這是多麽快樂呵！但是我們爲了捉鳥，把寳貴的光陰耗費掉，那未免太不合算，太不經濟了。因此我把一個考騐過的經濟方法，介紹給你們，旣不抛棄多大的光陰，並且可享受極大的樂趣，諸位小友不妨試一下，纔知道哩。</p>
<p>用具：剷刀一把，較厚的木板一塊，細竹三根和米少許。</p>
<p>說明：先挑選一塊鳥雀麕集的地方，將那塊木板平放在地上，用竹照木板劃好界線，再取剷刀依照綫界掘一深照三寸半的土坑，（圖一）掘成以後，把一根竹頭的二分之一，揷進坑的泥底；再拿一根，使它橫靠在揷好的一頭上，看（圖二）。進一步，用最後的一根細竹，斜支在橫放的那根中點，參看（圖三）。這三根竹置妥後，便可很小心謹愼地將木板平放在斜的竹頭上面，瞧（圖四）。最後撒一把米在坑中，就大功告成啦！你祗要站在五六丈遠的地方瞧鳥兒入坑，木板傾覆，預備捕捉好了。</p>
<p>（附白）當鳥兒飛進土坑中時，必會站立在橫竹上啄求吃，那橫竹吃不下鳥的壓力，於是便跌落下去，而木板也隨着蓋覆，鳥兒關在坑中了。不過當你伸手進坑捕捉時，要非常小心，否則白費功夫，空歡喜一塲哩。</p>

<p>— 兹九</p>
<p>「墮胎」在這世界上，恐怕除出蘇聯以外，都認爲犯罪的。所以營此業者，祇好秘秘密密，而要墮胎的，更得偷偷摸摸，因其是秘密暗行，這裏就百病叢生了。本月十三四兩日各報紙上，都有正經醫院爲兪楊氏墮胎案之記載。大意是「夫業撑船之無錫婦人兪楊氏因嫌子女過多，特來滬求正經醫院墮胎，雙方講妥墮胎費七十元，當給丸藥六枚，藥水兩瓶，藥粉兩包，楊氏回至旅館，先服丸藥，次及藥水藥粉，經五日胎物始下，但仍疼痛不堪。情急，遣人投告虹口捕房，捕房以打胎觸犯刑律，將看護——醫生在逃——產婦胎物，一應帶至捕房，開審結果，判楊氏罰金八十元，看護婦無罪釋放，……」由這一條新聞，更聯想到：常聞某某太太在某某醫院墮胎，化去幾百元，某醫生專業秘密墮胎而發財。某婦人求穩婆秘法墮胎，生命葬送。某女士服某藥房的所謂墮胎靈藥，胎不下而滿身浮腫。某大姐服金鷄納霜打胎，結果雙耳重聽。某嫂子私服麝香，血崩身死，等的傳說或事實。想富者被醫生敲竹槓，化去數百元，尙不緊要，而貧者的求治無門，不得已求諸穩婆或藥物，因此而喪身致病者屢屢，這眞是人間的至慘至悲的事！</p>
<p>考諸要墮胎的動機，大約不外：（一）困於經濟無力敎養，（二）熱心事業，藉此得節少育兒之煩，（三）身體孱弱，不堪大產，（四）失身懷孕，怕受社會之誹謗，或無人負育兒之責等。但在這經濟恐慌的狂瀾中，在這社會絕少顧及兒童與婦女的保護的現社會下，我們知道墮胎一事，必會更潛流滋行於未來的時日中，假使承認婦女與兒童是人類的支柱的話，公立的合理的人工墮胎所或顧問處，實有急行設立的必要。這絕不是提倡殺人，而是爲人類求幸福。因與其任它在秘密中作惡，不如公開地使它走入正軌。旣易於管理，亦便於監視或限制。至於方法問題當不是本文篇幅所能及的。</p>
<p>此外墮胎在中國現行法中，有判以徒刑之處分，這裏當然也有研究與改革的必要，希望當今的衛生行政者與法律學家注意及之。</p>
<h3 id="c277">蘇聯的妻子（三續） <a href="#c277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— Anna　Loviie　Strong亮秋譯著</p>
<p>蘇聯的妻子們用什麽標凖來評判貞操，離婚等問題呢？她們不用傳統的標凖，祗用人格和社會價值來評判的。在我們，家庭不是和整個世界分離而獨立的，牠是世界的一個單位，牠的價值需視牠對於整個世界的關係而定。這種用社會化的目光來測量家庭的情形一次從一個靑年玻璃工人的談話中很粗劣的表現出來，我遇見他的時候他正在養病地休養，一天黄昏他對我說，他是怎樣的希望擁抱一個女子。因爲以前他曾表示過他對於一只蘋菓和一枝紙烟有着同樣的希望，這話有些侮辱我們同性，我有些激怒了。</p>
<p>「你好像有許多慾望似的。」我說這句話，無意中暗示着强烈的慾望。他薄怒的否認道：「我唯一的慾望是革命，其餘的祗是希望而已。」「一個女子，和蘋菓一樣，也是你的希望嗎？」我問他。他很坦直的說道：「自然，對於一個女子的希望要比較嚴重些，因爲這和生命的基礎有關而且能影響到將來的。但即使一個人結了婚，也不能常和他的妻子在一處的。這也是一種暫時的希望，滿足了就完了。在我，祇有一種慾望是永久的。這就是用我的全力爲蘇維埃的威權而工作，使革命貫澈世界。」</p>
<p>「那個女子對於你的慾望怎麽樣呢？」我問。「我希望她能和我同志」他很冷淡的說，「否則，我對她的情感會不能持久的。」</p>
<p>有一次我和一個二十歲的女子在同一寓所裏住了一年。好幾次我看見一個愛她的靑年在她房裏過宿，過後，我很奇怪她仍是個處女。對於我這種奇怪，她倒好像很驚異。她解釋給我聽說那靑年是從另一個城裏來看她，因爲没處住，所以就住在她那裏，那和她的女友一樣。「在我們的工廠中，幾乎每個女工都是處女。」她說，「間或有二三個女子，和男子隨隨便便發生關係，但她們都是浮躁而不努力工作，爲我們所不齒的。大部份的女子，是怕和男子發生關係的。」「生理的害怕嗎？」我問她。「不，害怕着牠對於我們的結果。一個名安娜的女子，在婚後，顯然地改變了。她雖没有脫離靑年共產黨，她也没有忽略她的工作；但她却失却了固有的興趣和活動力了。或者她已有了孕，她的身體不及以前康健了。你看，一個人的生活會這樣的消沉；對於社會事業會這樣的失去興趣！這是我們所以害怕的理由。我們不能太注意到個人生活在我們没有堅固的社會的基礎以前。這態度幾乎是每個蘇聯未婚女子所瞭解的。雖然大部份的女子，不這樣的膽小。有許多結過婚的靑年仍在大學裏念書，男的住在男宿舍，女的住在女宿舍裏，他們的孩子就放在大學所設的育兒院裏。蘇聯的靑年就這樣的把個人生活和社會責任連合起來。所以個人「情愛」不一定是一種對於社會利益的威脅，有許多人，且因此而增加社會的興趣。但我們任何個婚姻的最後目標！不是當事人的兩相忠實，而是相互的對於社會工作的忠實。</p>
<p>離婚，在蘇聯，像在别的國家一樣的會發生；但我們對於離婚的道德和世界上别的國家完全不同。在我們，任何已婚的人，在不論什麽時候，都有離婚的可能。我們的法律理論以爲不顧一個人的意志而强迫着行性的結合是違法的。許多人不聲不響的離了婚，把相互間的誤會消滅於高尙的「同意」中，我們以爲是值得尊敬而最合理的事，在紐約是以爲最不道德的了。在美國，離婚的二當事人在法庭上公開的控告對方的虐待或無恥行爲，在我們看來，是卑鄙而無禮的。在鈕約新聞紙的首頁，登載着一個丈夫因爲要守看他妻子的情人從她房裏出來，在她的房外坐了一個冬夜，對於這事，我們的評語是：「一個十足的呆子，」或竟是個瘋了，爲要知道些不樂意的事在不安適中度着整夜！假若他要他的妻回到他身邊，他應當這樣做嗎？假若他不要的話，爲什麽不把往事快些忘却了呢？」在我們，嫉妬不是可頌揚的道德，而是可咀咒的痛苦的殘餘。</p>

<p>— 碧梧</p>
<p>通常的女人是難得幾個及得上楊家虢國夫人的。在環境容許她或鼓勵她修飾之下，她不至於「郤嫌脂粉污顏色」，而淡掃娥眉。古者承平之世，男的儒雅風流，女的輕盈綺媚，這時女子稍事塗抹，郤也實得其宜。</p>
<p>但當悲戚哀思之時，像三年前東北初亡的當兒，舉國淚盡聲嘶，婦女也憔悴毁容；卽最繁華的上海的最繁華的校花皇后，都脫退了鮮服，盛行所謂「靑布運動」。足見憂國之忱，人所同具；環境不容許她們時，婦女并没有昧盡天良。</p>
<p>時光飛逝，牠載了沉痛的過去葬諸淵海，運來春花秋月，又點染一個美麗快樂的世間。先生們談佛談鬼，談女人談神仙；仕女們點唇畫眉，油小腿染指甲。大有承平氣象，頗能慰一部分慕古的人們之望。</p>
<p>祇是，倘然她偶爾注視鏡中濃裝的本身，而回憶三年前靑布衣衫的姿態，暗中不知是歡喜還是赧然？三年的時間，國難并未稍减，而自己已前後判若兩人。</p>
<p>有人將我們的國難，比之婦人的生產；產時一陣號痛呼天，產後便又抱子怡然。這粗看似乎很切，但細看郤又不倫。婦人產子，是創造，是新生；而國難是束頸的麻繩。如果必欲將國難在婦女身上找個譬喩，我想最好是比成癰毒。曾聽過一個面部生癰毒的女人，她起初當這東西是一粒雀斑或粉刺，給濃厚的脂粉敷上，以爲可以掩護，誰知她就以此喪身。</p>
<p>三年的國難伏毒已曰漸深長；而我們郤正流於風流香豔，脂粉修飾。這而不遭破滅，也太稀奇。自然，敵人的砲聲，此時確乎去得很遠；但乘此便製造承平空氣，以爲天下已該我們淸談倩笑，陶醉享樂，這郤是千眞的妖孽。婦女們犧牲於這空氣中的不知幾何。將有用的光陰，用之於無爲的修飾；到頭霹靂一聲，以爲亡國者實出艶裝之徒。愚人但知隨流浮沉，雖遭竊鈎之枉罪，也是不足惜的。</p>
<p>倘然婦女不渾渾噩噩，而正視目前的國難，她豈只是三年前「靑布運動」時的勇氣，或將更有堂堂皇皇的態度矯揉粉飾的環境，於她又能如之何？</p>

<h3 id="c280">論女作家的生理影響與生活影響 <a href="#c280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— 陳君冶</p>
<p>以一個偶然的機會，在朋友處看到上月二十九日的天津庸報，在副刋另外一頁上我讀到一篇題名爲「評日本女作家」的文字，這篇文字的副標題是「思想轉移多與生理有關係」，這頗引動了我的興趣。</p>
<p>在這篇文字的第一段這樣寫着：「打開一部文學史，看不到一本稱爲傑作的女人作品，這或者是由於當時的社會關係。但現在，在蘇聯也看不到一本好像「開拓了的處女地」那樣的傑作，這或者是由於女人在生理上的關係，在中國，女流作家只剩得三四個人了，其餘失踪的也有，死去的也有；但在鄰國日本，女作家却正在伸展着……事先，我發見了一種可驚奇的生理上的影響，就是女流作家多分接受着丈夫的暗示，在生理學上，女人與男人交合後，女人的血液中，卽存有了男人的素質，而且實際在思想上也沾染了不少的暗示，如丁玲的受胡也頻，窪川稻子的受窪川鶴次郎，中條之受宮本顯治，平林泰子之受小堀甚二，實在是一種極明顯的現象。</p>
<p>從以上這段話裏，我們極容易看出這篇文字的作者把女作家不能產生傑作的原因委諸於生理的影響上，我以爲是極其有疑問的。</p>
<p>首先我不很相信「打開一部文學史，看不到一本稱爲傑作的女人作品」這句話，文學史所告知我們的就有不少的由女流作家產生的好的作品，譬如稍舉兩個例子吧，法國的浪漫主義時代的喬治桑（Ｇeorge　Sand）底幾本田園小說，無論如何不比同時代的男作家如繆塞之流遜色（在藝術的評價上），就是一例；蘇聯現代的女作家賽孚林娜，英倍爾，沙金揚，也有不少的成功的作品，我們是决不可抹殺她們的。再說到中國的丁玲，她的幾部小說，已有定評，無須我在此曉舌了。</p>
<p>如果說自文學史以來的女流作家没有如男作家這樣的多，這樣的豐富，這話是可以成立的。但原因也不是由於女子的生理作用。「女人與男人交合後，女人的血液中，卽存有了男人的素質……」云云甲以說明女作家作爲附屬男子的理由，是完全不充分的。文學史上女流作家之所以比男作家爲數少的原故，我們不可不委之於男性中心制度的社會的原因。拿我們中國來說，過去的女子，（卽是現在的也不爲過）根本地不能多接觸社會生活，從她們要求與男子同樣的文學，當然是感到困難的。法國的喬治桑在思想上生活上是一個背叛舊社會傳統思想的人物，她的豐富的生活才使他產出比較可觀的作品，而中國的李淸照只能寫她那工愁善病的詩詞，亦適是她的那生活限制了她的原故。但在今日的蘇聯，情形就逈異了，賽孚林娜，沙金揚，以女工的身分，而能產出可驚的著作，其原因也在此，生活爲先。（La　Vie　avant　toutl）</p>
<p>至於說丁玲受胡也頻的影響，窪川稻子受窪川鶴次郎，中條受宮本顯治的影響，如果硬派這是由於她們和她們的丈夫交會過的原故，簡直大謬不然。這種說法，也許很受了佛羅伊特（Freud）思想的惡毒吧！與其說是這影響是出自兩方的交合，毋寗說是出自共同生活上習慣上思想上的相互的影響。</p>
<p>關於女流作家未能產出如男作家的豐富的創作，决不能從弗羅伊德主義生理的解釋，獲得正確的結論，弗羅伊德主義所閙的笑話，也已經够多了！我們如欲找出女流作家不多及她們的作品不豐富的原因，我們祇有拿史的唯物論來作解答的根據！</p>

<p>—賢母良妻制—</p>
<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>看了梨瑚先生的「我也來談談賢母良妻」，接着又是斐先生的「究竟誰是向歷史開倒車」的答辯以後，不由得我起了很好的感想，覺得中國注意社會的人，確是比較從前趨白於「理智」不是像從前不顧事實，只憑着自己一時的感情同理想亂嚷，當然有例外，好得多！</p>
<p>斐先生的求「眞理」精神眞佩服極了，以種種的理由覺得男女應敎育平等一切平等，不錯，只要是人都應該享受一切平等權利的！斐先生提議的好，「爲什麽男子的敎育不抱良夫賢父呢？」「女子祇可以做賢母良妻嗎」？可是問題來了：</p>
<p>我們不贊成「賢母良妻制」，我們當然也反對，良夫賢父制，同樣的人，當然同樣的爲社會努力，各盡所能地到社會裏去做社會的事業！然而，照這樣，有了孩子有了家庭怎樣辦呢，斐先生雖然聲明，「這不是說男女不需要「共同合作」，「扶助」或有了孩子不養育訓育…」但是，在「賢母良妻」同「良夫賢父」互相推諉之下，我們除了劉大白先生提出的「一組織公共厨房（二）開辦公共育兒院，或公共託兒所」之外，對於一班兒童同家庭的「處置」却有點疑難了，斐先生所說的是合乎理想中社會，在未達到理想社會之前，當然不是「因噎廢食」，對於一班兒童互相推諉之下的兒童，是不是應該負着敎育新的兒童責任。在家庭方面是不是應該有管理的責任，雖然這是極小的事，敢問斐先生的男女需要合作，扶助或養育訓育兒童，怎樣才算斐先生理想中的合作，扶助或養育訓育兒童？邵力子先生也說「兒童公育問題，是我絕對贊成的，我相信社會根本改造的時候，這是一個必不可缺的條件，兒童不公育，勞働問題和婦女問題都不能解决」足見得邵力子先生是「之兒育不公育勞働問題和婦女問題都不能解决」注重在「社會根本改造的時候」，在過渡時期怎樣呢？我們是不是不顧孩兒們一切，聽其自然，家庭也可以不問，專心到社會裏做事，專爲社會研究學術嗎？問題就在這裏。</p>
<p>其實斐先生並没有說在任何時刻男女都應該到社會集團裏去，而且更没有談到在過渡時期應該怎樣辦，斐先生的一篇一究竟誰是向歷史開倒車」大作，不過是「敬質梨瑚君」一篇文章，照這樣說，我上面所說的可有些「牛頭不對馬嘴」了。但是嚴重的問題，却在過渡時期，我想斐先生寫「究竟誰是向歷史開倒車」一篇以後，應該再繼一篇「賢母良妻的善後」，否則斐先生同芸綺先生所倡言的結果，就不堪想像的了！</p>
<p>只要有點知識的人，都覺得過渡時期來得重要，孫中山先生着重在訓政時期也是要達到憲政的目的，斐先生和芸綺先生假使是擁護男女平等的信徒，那麽對於目前矛盾過渡的社會，應當抱着什麽態度和辦法，是不是先生們前議所能行得出的？敬祝撰安　潘伊紅</p>
<p>編者按：自本刋發表了芸綺君的「談談賢母良妻制」一文後，讀者紛紛來稿討論，因限於篇幅不能一一登載，不得已選取黎瑚君的「我也來談談賢母良妻制」載於二十九期本刋，又於三十期登載斐君的「究竟誰是向歷史開倒車的呢」一文，現在討論這問題的稿件，尙在紛至沓來中，内有潘伊紅君來信，要求在這過渡時期尋法適當的辦法，現在爲廣徵讀者意見計，爲公開討論計，將潘君原函登載於此，請讀者多多發表意見。</p>

<p>— 仃</p>
<p>是在六年前的秋天吧？</p>
<p>當菲莎還是個靑春少女的時候，她的生命充滿着純潔與熱情，她有副俊俏的臉龐，玲琍的眼睛，月兒灣灣的娥眉，櫻桃的小脣，梨渦的微笑，性情是活潑的，恣態是天眞的。</p>
<p>而她那種有條有理的說話，懂事的，没有舊式家庭小姐那種迂腐，拘束，這是引起她的一種自傲，也可說是她自負自大的一種理由。</p>
<p>反正，她那種特質，是引起不少男子們對她的追逐與欽慕，至於女性呢？在她同性的朋友當中，可說十之八九都是憎惡她，鄙夷她，妒嫉她的。</p>
<p>然而，菲莎完全是個少女，她有顆熱烘烘的心，對於那些，她似乎漠不相關似的。</p>
<p>對於自己的未來，她抱了一綫遠大的指望，她的理想是一個女子不該和男性有優劣的區别，她感覺女子并不比男子弱，委實在她的面前，不知有多少的男子屈膝於她的裙下，她蔑視他們，她討厭那些呆頭笨腦的傢伙，她頂瞧不起一個男子不像男子那個模樣。</p>
<p>因此，她的視綫更加展開了。她老盼望着自己能够做一個出類拔萃的女性，被所有的靑春的男女都愛戴她，贊美她，佩服她。她有一種異乎尋常的脾氣，便是不願，也不許任何的男女有蔑視她或不屑她的那種表情或行爲。但是她又不是像一般女子那樣，歡喜弄恣作態，怩怩忸忸的去博取人們的歡心。她常常瞧不起自己的同性，她十分鄙夷那些甘自墮落寗受玩弄的菲薄女子，她覺得女子，許多以爲生來就不是出息的，生來就願甘受踐踏的，可是她無論怎樣都不承認有這點的劣性。</p>
<p>她喜歡和男性交際，想在異性的氛圍裏，吸取一些新鮮的空氣，想多多的認識一點世情，學習一些在她同性中很難得到的經騐及智識。她很明白老在女子的圈子裏旋，于她是没有什麽益處的，但她和男子往來，也并非濫交，也不和人胡調，她决心，想把自己投進男性的烘爐中，將她陶冶一下。把她的個性，生活，體格都鑄熔一下，使她成爲一個健全的人類。她知道單恃男子那種剛直倔强的氣質是不够的，而只有女子那種温柔的偏重於情感方面也不行。一個人，她覺得，該應具有兩種的性情才成！</p>
<p>起初，當她在敎會學校唸書的時候，不消說她的思想是落後的，董染着洋奴敎育的氣味，新式資產階級小姐那種思想。對於封建的生活的形式，起了一種反抗，但她没有民族的意識。</p>
<p>後來離開敎會學校了，她的年紀也漸漸的長大起來，和社會上多方面的人物的薰觸，使她漸漸的發現了自已種種的缺陷，對於過去那種錯誤的言行，她起了天大的慚愧，極大的懊悔和厭惡。</p>
<p>并且有一件事使她憤憤不服的，便是在她新近交友的同性裏頭，她常常被人冷嘲與熱駡。她心裏非常不安，她覺得自己并不比她們差，在普通的世情上，她自信比君謾靑芬愛麗她們都强，怎的她反而受侮呢？她們難道恃着某種神秘的力量使她非屈不成？</p>
<p>後來，她漸漸發覺自己的伶俐，傲岸，和那種摩登的態度是引起她們最大反感的所在。這點，更使她深感不服。難道像她們那種樸質的，笨氣的舉動是該受人贊美嗎？但不論怎樣的，她總受委屈似的，這使她苦惱，使她抑鬰，使她成爲一種憤恚。（未完）</p>

<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>電政會議於本月四日至六日，在首都交通部大禮堂舉行，到會人員，濟濟蹌蹌，所得結果，亦極美滿，不可謂非空前之盛會也，記者參加其間，覺各方空氣，無不和洽可親，所發言論，亦至推誠相與，電信包括有無綫電及電話，尋常或疑有門戶之見，但試就會塲内容，細加觀察，則固水乳交融，通力合作。電政前途之發展，於此次會議，可謂得有充分把握。</p>
<p>交通部此次所以召集各省電政負責人員，舉行會議，其理由記者於前期本刋，已有述及。年來關於電信業務之發展，電信綫路之整頓與擴充，以及便利民衆，增加效能，種種方針，雖多實施，尙有遺憾，故此次會議，交部詳求各地狀况，博採多數建議，成爲一種切於實用，而能通行之整個辦法，俾時局漸入軌道，電信事業，亦得隨而邁進，非放言高論，徒留若干影象，作爲事後之談料者可比也。</p>
<p>因會議結果之圓滿，以及各方感情之融洽，事業前途發展之可期，本刋自樂爲彙集言論記述實在情形，發爲專號。讀者念及我國電信事業之重要，覘乎本屆電政會議，當可窺見交通當局努力之一斑。</p>
<h3 id="c284">讀汪院長電政會議訓詞 <a href="#c284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— 楨</p>
<p>交通部所召集之電政會議，已於本月四日開幕，集羣英於一堂，採博聞於衆議，誠盛事也。屆時行政院長汪精衛氏，翩然蒞止，親致訓詞，洋洋數千言，將電政不能發達之原因，及今後應取之政策，愷切訓示，深中時弊。記者躬聆之餘，不覺肅然起敬！汪氏訓詞之重要性不可不述之：</p>
<p>汪氏之言曰：「國難以來，各種建設事業，在國難中力求進展而且較有成績的，要算交通鐵道兩部。……郵電同在困難之下，同受極大損害之下，於國難及其他天災人禍之中，靠朱部長和各位負責人員的努力和奮鬥，才有現在的成績。」自九一八事變後，國營事業之受打擊者，除鐵道外，厥爲郵電。卽以電政而論，損失報話局所計二百三十餘處，綫路八萬七千餘里，營業收入每年約三百一十餘萬元之多，而同人顚沛流連於僞政府鐵蹄之下者，不下三千餘人，極人世之痛苦。然欲恢復失地，端在充實國力與努力建設而已。我交通當局，基於上項惟一目標，積極整理電政，關於行政之革新，業務之改進，工程之建設，財政之統一，均有顯著之成績，較之數年前凌亂之象，誠有天壤之别。此種困苦奮鬥之過程，得予吾人一種重要之啟示，卽電信工作人員，在主管長官指導之下，所以加倍努力者，深覺非發揚民族意識，不足以言救亡圖存，非努力建設，不足以發揚民族意識，所謂「多難興邦」者，殆謂此歟？</p>
<p>汪氏又曰：「本來電政事業，是很可以發達的一種事業，但自民國以來，所以不能十分發達的原因，就是受軍事政治上的影響。……而電政前途，因此受到很大的影響和打擊，這都是軍政機關不明白電政事業，是營業性質的原故。」又曰：「軍政機關的破壞，應使他們明白對於國營事業之損害，亦卽損害他們自己的利益。」汪氏之言，何其沉痛若是耶！自鼎革以還，國内政治不能統一，爭城爭地，時有所聞！電信事業，隨之破壞殆盡！如濫發軍電也，擅委局長也，攘奪電欵也，割斷綫桿也，在在予電政以致命傷。因國内政治不能統一，故電政事業不能發展。因電政事業不能發展，故國内政治愈不能統一，二者互爲因果，互相關係。現今政治漸見澄淸，電政日有進步，觀於此次電政會議，粤·桂·川·滇·黔各省電政主管人員，均連袂入都，參加盛會。又觀於大會議案，大都注重全國電政整個計劃，而疏通邊遠通信，尤爲當務之急。自今以後，全國電政已入統一時期，因電政之統一，轉而促進政治之統一，自屬必然之理。所望軍政機關，深凛汪氏之旨，明白電信爲營業性質，又明白破壞電信，卽爲損害自己。此應請軍政機關與全國民衆特别注意者也。</p>
<p>最後汪氏揭櫫行政院之政策，爲「國營事業商業化，」而推行此項政策者，在於「通力合作，」尤爲今日不刋之論。蓋國營事業，最易官僚化，過去數十年中之電政，因受官僚政治之影響，故皆腐化不堪！欲圖改革，非實行商業化不可。但以全國幅員之大，電信事業之繁，又非全國上下通力合作不爲功。年來電政當局，對於電報業務，純以商業化爲依歸，如委託旅行社代收電報，予旅行者發電之便利；創設交際電報，開闢電報應用之途徑。設置業務稽查員，以資聯絡，添設正誤校對員，以免錯誤。减低加急電價目，另訂收報人姓名住址計費辦法，免收郵轉電報郵費，及路轉電報過綫費，以减省民衆發電之費用，而郵電合設與局台合併兩種辦法，尤以節省經費與便利民衆，爲唯一目標，凡此種種，皆力行商業化之政策也。至於「通力合作」一節，亦係本部最近主張，如去年頒布委託省政府代辦長途電話原則，卽爲與各省政府合作之基礎。此與汪氏訓詞，若合符節焉。</p>
<p>回憶國難暴發之時，汪氏以「建設求統一，」爲救亡圖存之口號，兩載以還，汪氏久秉國鈞，努力促其實現。此次電政會議，汪氏以誠意態度，親致訓詞，吾人應誠意接收，以無負我領袖喁喁望治之盛意。近代戰爭有所謂總動員者，卽全國民衆在最高領袖與唯一目標之下，人人努力本身職務，同時人人加强民族國家意識之謂。我電信工作人員之所以報國者在此，所以自救者亦在此也。</p>
<h3 id="c285">爲「慢電代郵」事答獨鶴君 <a href="#c285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— 雲城</p>
<p>本月六日上海新聞報新園林載有獨鶴談話一則，大意是他的老弟蔭武，這次到廣州去出席全國律師恊會，在上月三十一日發來一電，直至本月二日上午二時，方才收到，中間相隔三十六小時之久。（同日報館接到新聞電祗隔三小時）。於是累得他一家人都十分焦急。（因爲計算船期决不會這樣遲緩）。他爲了此事，致函本埠電報局詢問，據電話中得到的答復，似乎說延誤之責，不在滬局，而在粤局。但無論是那一方面延誤，總之可見商電被壓的情事，依然不能避免。像他的這件事雖小，不過普通商電，關係較之，無緣無故隨便延擱，請問是否合理。這次電政會議中對於這樣「慢電代郵」的大缺點，曾否提議到改進的方法。</p>
<p>我做這篇答獨鶴君談話的文章，並不是想來替電報局護短，更不敢說獨鶴君的談話有些偏激。不——我人看了獨鶴君這篇談話，覺得他到底是位多年談話的老手，非但說來娓娓動聽，而且有些地方的確心平氣和·十分公允。例如他說：「自從國民政府成立以來，關於交通行政，似乎比較上總有些進步一。我人對於獨鶴君這種公正的態度，表示十分的欽敬。因爲老實說：上海和華南的電報綫路，向來因爲政治關係，未能十分修理通暢，這是公開的秘密，若在從前軍閥時代，由廣州發到上海一電，不要說中間相隔三十六小時，就是相隔七十二小時，甚至一百四十四小時，也是平常得很。所以如果在那個時代像獨鶴君這樣一位明白時勢的人，决不會大驚小怪的。反之，在歐美電信優良發達的國家，電報的速率，是以分杪爲單位的。那末，從廣州到上海一張新聞電，中間隔了三小時，在獨鶴君認爲差堪滿意的，在彼國的民衆，一定要像隔了三十六小時一樣的詫異了。所以我人對於獨鶴君這一次的抗議，非但不發生反感，而且覺得這正是交通當局幾年來努力改進電政，已經獲得相當效果的明證。掉一句文言，可以說「宛如空谷足音」，令人聞之色喜。</p>
<p>但是獨鶴君雖是文壇的鉅子，對於電報這樣行業，究竟是門外漢，所以說話之間，不免有點誤會。何以見得呢？因爲他一則曰：「商電被壓」·再則曰：「無緣無故·隨便延壓」，好像電報局的人，都是與商電有仇，所以故意壓擱一般。他不曉得商電的收入，乃電局人員養命之源，商電正是他們的親人，何致有意與之爲難呢！那末，獨鶴君或者要問，「由廣州到上海新聞電，祗要三小時，我的電報，爲什麽偏要三十六小時？」——是的，請獨鶴君息怒，讓我來稍爲解釋一下。</p>
<p>原來上海廣州之間，共有兩條有綫電路，一條無綫電路。（此外還有兩條外國公司的水綫，從上海通香港轉通廣州）無綫電路是直達的，但是容量有限，不能傳遞華北華中與華南往來之全部電報。有綫電路一條，是沿海的近路，從上海到福州，福州到廣州。一條是繞道的遠路，從上海到漢口·漢口到長沙·長沙到衡州·衡州到韶關·韶關到廣州。獨鶴君所說的新聞電·大槪是走無綫電路或竟不惟出加倍的代價走外國公司水綫來的。而他老弟的電報，是走沿海的陸綫近路來的。可眞是不巧的很，這張電報剛走到福州的時候，偏遇福州到上海的這條陸綫，因爲人力不可抵抗的原因阻斷，（這原因大家都明白的），因此不得不退回去再走繞大圈子的遠路，這樣一來時間不免耽擱了。這當時廣州電報局未將那張電報送交無綫電台拍發，其中不免有點不是。但我們曉得無綫電的傳報容量是有限的。如果那時的無綫電路已是十分擁擠，就是送過去也無益的。</p>
<p>總之，這一次的事情，我不敢說電報局一定没有錯——關於這一點，料那素以負責著稱的交通當局，定會澈查，並予獨鶴君以滿意的答復。但電報局卽使有錯，我可以担保絕對不是有意的。因爲電報局是靠電報吃飯的，猶如新聞報館是靠新聞吃飯的一樣。報館裏登載新聞，有時因爲採訪不周，以致失實，也是在所難免。如果有人據此卽謂新聞報館專門造謠，我想獨鶴先生一定也要極口呼寃的吧。</p>

<p>— 國松</p>
<p>當電政會議行將開幕之時，本刋上期，已舉該會所負之使命三點，以告國人，卽討論計劃之實施，整理通信之方法，與研究業務之改進而已。原來該會之召集，係因交部長官，亟欲明瞭各地電政情形，以便通盤籌劃，澈底整頓，特請各地主管人員，齊到南京，從容討論，廣集衆思，以供部内之參考。故該會規模務求縮小，目的重在實行。旣非代表會議，有限制執行之表决權，亦無宣傳性質，對外舖張之作用。換言之，該會全係内部討論與内部整理之會議，故開會時無新聞記者列席，閉幕時亦無宣言發表也。</p>
<p>今者電政會議，於本月四日開幕，經三日之審查討論决議終畢，於六日閉幕矣。總計大會提案，雖有四百餘件，然以歸納别之，不外建設有綫無綫與電話之電路，改進業務報務，訓練人員，及整理財政與健全組織等項方案而已。各種决議案，大都請由部司採擇施行，蓋各種提議，太半係原理原則，而於具體辦法，多忽焉不詳，如何見諸實施，其斟酌損益之間大有研究之價值。電司爲電政主管機關，對於各種議案，當以客觀環境與事實根據，審愼周詳，分别緩急辦理，期於有當而後已。</p>
<p>或曰：會議之說，吾聞之熟矣。猶憶十七年之交通會議，當時何等熱烈！何等偉大！乃會議之後，寂然無聲，宛如劇終人散空留感想。電政會議，能毋類是乎？予曰：不然！大凡會議之精神，不决於會議之本身，而在於召集人之動機與决心如何爲斷。前者交通會議範圍廣大，目的旣已不專，人事牽連，意見尤爲複雜。其提案關於行政方面者多，關於技術方面者少，故其結果，僅取消一電政總局，而對於業務報務之改進，工程之設計，殊無多大貢獻。至此次電政會議，係交部當局，聽取全國專家意見，作爲施政之參考，同時告以部司所定之方針，以期上下之合作。重實行不重空論，重恊議不重雄辯，重事業之發展，不重權利之競爭。動機旣純，目標專一，决心生於誠意，良知卽能良行，成敗利鈍，可以逆睹，較之交通會議，固不可同日語也。電政會議之精神，其在斯乎？</p>
<h3 id="c288">我所見於電政會議者 <a href="#c288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>— 記者</p>
<p>自國府定都南京以來，所舉行之各種會議，屢見不鮮，其始也與會諸君無不興高采烈，血脈僨張，以爲經過會議，各種問題，均可迎刃而解。迨至開幕時，人人又多敷衍塞責，或負氣爭論，各不相下。及其閉幕以後，事過境遷，烟消雲散，祗留得議案一巨册，供人瀏覽而已。此種病根，有人謂國人惰性不能袪除之故，又有人謂國人不知會議政策之故，更有人謂主管長官無誠意實行之故，所以每種會議，深予吾人一種不良之印象。</p>
<p>然而此次電政會議，自不能以上項成見目之。因交部該會召集之動機，在於明瞭各地情形，以便通盤籌劃，澈底整頓，是以該會目的，在於邀集全國電信專家，共同討論，共同研究，以貢獻交通當局各種改革之資料。故不重形式而重精神，不尙專行而尙合作。會員與部司之間，要在上下相孚，會員與會員之間，要在情誼融洽，無所謂怨望，亦無所謂缺望，更用不着縱橫捭闔之手腕，肝膽相見，親愛精誠，此電政會議不同各種會議之點也。</p>
<p>電政會議，旣有特殊之點，故其結果，當有特殊之成績，管見所及，書之於左：</p>
<p>（一）統一精神　按電信事業，無論在行政方面，技術方面，或業務方面，均含有整個一致之性質，决不因地域上之關係，與政治上之變遷，而有所歧異。可是我國電政，自民元以來，受政治軍事上之影響，分離崩析，破壞無餘！西南各省電政册報，多未解報中央查核，故交部雖有通盤籌算之計劃，每苦扞格難行。因電政之不能統一，故政情上殊多隔閡，因政情之隔閡，故電政愈須統一。此次電政會議，粤，桂，川，滇，黔，西南各省電政主管人員，均按期到京，參加盛會，此在電政史上可大書特書者也。西南諸君，經此一番出席以後，將各地實際之情况，報告中央，又將中央勵精圖治之苦心，轉達各地，彼此意見接近，精神上已趨一致，電政統一，爲期不遠矣。</p>
<p>（二）合作精神　按自十七年以後，我國無綫電報，開始正式建設，因爲制度優良，設備完善，國内外通信，都有相當成績，嶄然露頭角。同時有綫電方面，亦不甘落後，急起直追，在過去數年之中，有無綫電衝突之聲浪，常震動吾人之鼓耳。究實言之，有無綫電各有所長，亦各有所短，應彼此嚴密合作，不應互相攻訏，此係理智之言。然而歷屆交通當局，無快刀斬亂麻之手段，又無持正不阿之態度，有無綫電，雖歸交部直轄，仍存對峙之局面。自朱部長蒞任後，廉明公正，才智過人，整理電政，不遺餘力，乃於今年四月毅然將全國局台逐一合併，數年糾紛，從此斬絕，斯值得社會人士歌頌者也。但朱氏仍不以現在成績爲滿足，乃於開幕之時，諄諄訓示：「今後本部非特於電政方面，必謀統一，卽郵電空航均須謀密切的聯絡，使成爲整個的交通事業之互相輔助，再推而至於其他國營事業使打成一片」。此種誠心合作之精神，正與汪院長通力合作之旨相脗合也。</p>
<p>（三）改革精神　我國電政，外受國難之嚴重，天災人禍之損害，内因制度之不良，組織之空疏，人事之紊亂，是以五十餘年以來，未見長足之發展。兩載以還，交通部次長領導於上，電信同人努力於下，澈底改革，社會信譽，蒸蒸日上。部長仍以職掌無定爲憂，乃制定會計制度與管理章程，又以技術落後爲慮，乃採用新式通報機械，舉辦九省長途電話及國際電話，高舉遠矚，非具大無畏之精神，曷克臻此！又觀於會員諸君之提案，多係革新電政之要圖，智生於明，知恥有勇，交通當局與會員諸君，明於電政之缺點，與恥於電信之落後，故能提出改革方案，與抖擻改革精神。我全體同人，應共體斯旨，抱最後之决心，與最大之毅力，忍耐負重，一德一心，以赴功令，事未有不濟者也。</p>
<p>電政會議，業已閉幕，宏猷擘畫，自當次第實行，以厭國人之望。記者躬逢其盛，特將所見，拉雜書之，敬爲介紹。亦爲社會人士所樂聞歟？</p>
<h3 id="c289">電政會議小統計 <a href="#c289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>

<p>— 淸華</p>
<p>最近交通部召開電政會議，聞提案多至四百餘件，其中大部分均係關於電政内部方面的整理與改善至與利用電信民衆有關的，也不在少。記者現在擇要向讀報告一下：</p>
<p>一、維持現行電報價目　此次會議中，有許多提案，都鑒於近年來郵政鐵路方面曾一再加價，提議隔省電報亦酌量加價每字二三分，以補電政的虧累，但經交部當局說明未便加價的理由後，終於議决仍舊維現行價目。這可見當局便利民衆，不願增加民衆負担的苦心！</p>
<p>二、加急長途電話按普通兩倍收費，加急長途電話原按普通價目三倍收費，現爲减輕發話人負担起見，議决改照普通價目兩倍收費。嗣後通長途電話而有急事者，可儘量利用加急電話，因較普通所費不多，而通話則可迅速異常也。</p>
<p>三、長途話局增加營業時間　各地長途話局有因營業淸淡，致每日營業時間甚短，商民方面感覺不便。兹爲便利商民早晚傳遞商情起見，特議决令飭各話局按照當地實際情形，延長營業時間，以利業務。</p>
<p>四、特製交際電報電封報紙　交際電報大都係慶賀喜事或弔唁喪葬，按照我國人之習慣，喜事輒用紅色，喪事則用白色或藍色，交際電報之電封及來報紙，如特製一種美術化並加印彩色，用於關於慶賀之電報，則受者必更喜悅，業務更易發達。故此議亦經通過，諒不久卽可見諸實現。</p>
<p>五、滬津厦福粤等處電台裝設自動機　以上五處往來電報極多，雖有電局水陸綫及電台人工無綫電機可以通報，但水陸綫有時阻斷，所有各報如均交電台收發，電台方面因係人工發報，實難勝任。故會議中議决從速在各該台裝置高速度自動收發報機，俾可担負巨量之報務，將來正式裝妥通報後，上海與華北華南往來電報，必可迅速異常。</p>
<p>以上所述各决議案，均待交部於最短期内籌備實行，讀者幸勿誤爲業已見諸實施也。</p>
<h3 id="c291">電政會議以後的希望 <a href="#c291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— 地佑</p>
<p>電政創辦迄今，已有五十餘年的歷史，在這悠久的歲月中，從未召集會議，來研討一個改進的方案。雖在十七年交通會議時，對於電政方面，也曾有所論列，但其性質總不若此次會議的專門化，而提案也不及此次之多而充實。所以此次會議，實開我國電政史上的新紀錄，值得吾人之紀念，自不待言。</p>
<p>會議中最足以引起我們感情上之興奮的，就是邊遠各省會員，都能不辭勞苦，不遠千里而來，這非特證明多年分離割裂的電政，已復歸於完整，更顯示我們的國家，已走上了統一的大道。但我們在歡愉快慰之中，無論誰都有一種慘痛的感想，——在大會裏找不到東北四省會員的踪跡！東北四省的電政，在日人宰割之下，轉瞬已經三年，不知已變成怎樣情狀！希望下次電政會議時，那廣大的失土已收復，而東北會員，能翩然蒞止。到那時候，我們更感到眞犖的愉快和歡慰。於此，我竭誠地希望全國電政同人，一致努力，埋頭苦幹，在通力合作之條件下，負起應盡的責任來，共同實現這偉大的願望！</p>
<p>其次：民國以來，國家多故，電政天天在艱難困苦中喘息無定地掙扎着，至今仍在窮愁之中，其所以致此之故自然是營業的衰落，而衰落的原因，是由於官軍電報之不付費。根據統計，全國電政收入，軍官電費要佔百分之六十，但這百分法上佔多數的收入，祗是數字上的表現，實際上是十分之九收不到現費的。以前北京政府時代所欠一筆巨量的官報費不必說了，卽自十七年國府成立迄今，各軍政機關欠下的報費，達二千萬元之多，試問全國電政機關，僅竟靠着少數商報費的收入來維持，那能支撑得住？那能不日趨敗壞？電政到了現在，已是百孔千瘡的時候，再不圖謀補救，勢將崩潰不可收拾。現在弄得員工欠薪，無法淸償，淺路窳放，無力整理，機械陳舊，無術更新，一切的一切，誠使人不忍卒述！在政府困難的今日，政軍機關拍發電報不能付費，亦是有他們的苦衷，但是有許多機關儘有力量付現，而仍狃於「向不付費」的舊習慣，不願付現。此種心理如不打破，電信事業，將永無辦法。</p>
<p>好在汪院長訓詞中，已經痛切詳明地說明，並且很有誠摯的表示，在行政院方面儘力帮助。這我們十二分的感佩的！我們更深信這位賢明的領袖坐而言，起而行，必能將上述的病根，逐一剷除的使電政第一步先獲得經濟上的解放，然後才有改進刷新的機會。同時更切望各方軍政當局共遵汪院長的意旨，體念電政的困難情形，通力合作，以共謀國營事業的發展！</p>

<p>萬目睽睽「期待已久」之電政會議，業於月之六日閉幕於首都。以電政關係國家社會之綦切，故國人期望於會議者亦愈殷。夫會議之使命，僅止於討論電政之興革，如何使决議施諸實行，是在當局之權衡，非會議所得而干預。顧吾人徵之交通當局年來對於電政改進之努力，與夫不尙空談，專事實踐之精神，已可預期會議必可產生良好之結果。觀夫此次會議不重形式上之鋪張，專事技術上之討論，一洗從來官塲之積習，益可證吾言之不謬。</p>
<p>夫政會之推行，固在下級人員之奉命惟謹，然必須賴主持者善於督率，始能發生實際上之效力。吾國政界，對於政令之遵守，向頗漠視，流弊所及，不特功令等諸具文，法令與實際，往往發生矛盾之怪象。揆其原因，大半係主持者之督率不力，但因文字上之空疏或因事實上之窒礙，亦爲政令不能實施重要原因之一。此次電政會議之召集，聚最高長官曁附屬各機關主管人員於一堂，各以其經歷之所得，作披瀝之討論。舉凡上級機關政令之意旨以及下級機關奉行之經過，均可藉會議之機會，精誠相見，率直敷陳，其有裨於政令之推行，當非淺鮮也。</p>
<p>抑尤有進者：此次會議之召集，因人數關係，祇限於各重要電政機關之主管人員。但低級人員鑒於會議之重要，亦各紛紛以書面提出意見，請求大會公决。出席諸君，雖因會期怱迫，未能作詳盡之研究，但仍顧念低級人員之利益，提付會議討論，此尤值得吾人之頌揚者也。</p>

<p>幾位要人的訓話——九月四日首次會議行開幕禮，交部部長朱家驊氏之訓話，言來極誠懇，且動聽，次長張道藩氏致詞，則頗多發人深省之語。惟行政院長汪精衛氏，因出席行政院會議，到獨遲，此日所到會員，羣欲一聆汪氏之言論風采，故汪氏登台訓話，時聞鼓掌之聲，汪氏素以演說著稱全國，對於此次電政會議闡發各點，聆者莫不滿意。</p>
<p>會塲的報號——會員以報到先後，編號定座，每次起立發言，按照會議規則，應先報號數，但亦有忘記報號，直接發言者，於是主席時常說：「請先報號數」，而會塲記錄的人員，先聆號數，亦得知某號發表意見，於記載上亦殊便利。</p>

<p>— 公樸</p>
<p>——紀念九一八國難三週年</p>
<p>「九一八」又是三週年了。國難好比家難，做當家人的總比孩子們來得更要沉痛哀悼罷！因爲爲一家之長者，如果不是由於無可逃避的災禍所造成的家難，當家人是要負嚴重的責任的。當此痛心之日到家，當家人見景生情，放聲一哭，自是人情的常事。爲孩子者覩此凄然哀悒情景，無心去責問過去的大錯造成，只知拔劍而起，以復興家道爲志，這正是事所應有。非然者，大家同聲一哭，雖屬痛快一時，但當涙乾眼酸之餘，相對木然，了無辦法，則其家必敗，其國必亡。</p>
<p>「九一八」三週祭，是全民族的奇恥大辱的日子。主國政者已規定是日「全國停止宴會娛樂，各地黨政軍警機關，各團體各學校分别集會紀念，並於是日上午十一時停止工作五分鐘，起立默念，誓雪國恥，以致沉痛之哀悼。」這可見我們的主國政者如何謀國之艱，尚未忘懷舊恨，並想藉這一天痛哭五分鐘，以舒洩數年來當家中所受的委屈，其凄清哀怨，至爲可感！但爲孩子的人民，當此民族危亡之際，是否還有餘暇，讓我們學婦人孺子之悲啼，不作天下健兒拔劍爲民族前驅呢？</p>
<p>專有紀念，不能退敵，專有悲啼，不足復興。當此全國沉默五分鐘中，我們腦海中應作如何默念呢？</p>
<p>第一，我們應清算「九一八」以來國人對抗日的一切不正確的觀念，一切可悲可痛的失策，認明今後的眞的出路。</p>
<p>第二，不要忽視人民抗日的力量，政府應立刻從事組織民　衆的工作，結成堅固的抗日陣綫。</p>
<p>第三，我們要準備自衛，準備對日戰爭，準備以自己的能力恢復失地，反對一切帝國主義在中國領土内從事戰爭。</p>
<p>第四，我們再不能依靠任何人代自已打不平了，同時更要打破全國上下苟安圖存的心理。</p>
<p>第五，我們要消滅「九一八」這一奇恥大辱的日子。</p>
<p>在今年我們不應沉痛五分鐘就算了事，也不是徒作以上的「觀念上」的紀念就算盡了國民之責。我想，讀本刋的諸君，就你們的職業關係說，大半都是商人，我希望你們能以抵貨爲你們的中心任務，去想它五分鐘，去做它一年。</p>
<p>我們應恢復九一八後抵制日貨的組織，重新起來檢查日貨，禁止販賣日貨，同時詳細調查奸商偷運日貨，把日貨改換商標，冒充國貨。我們應組成調查網，密佈到各業内去，以大衆的力量來揭穿漢奸的隂謀。這是我們店員學徒在這沉痛的五分鐘後，拔劍而起的爲民族前驅的一種工作。</p>
<p>我們都應以自己特殊的社會地位用行動來紀念「九一八」，再不能是徒然「痛哭」。</p>

<h3 id="c296">今後的德意志政局 <a href="#c296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>— 永德</p>
<p>—國内政治，經濟，外交的難關—</p>
<p>我們還記得去年七月十三日希特勒在國會向國社黨員報告種種第二次革命隂謀事件之經緯時，受全體黨員一致的贊成，都高呼「希特勒萬歲！」的情形吧。從此以後希特勒的政權的基礎就愈益强固，同時放逐與第二次革命隂謀事件有關係的黨員，拉攏心腹的黨員，一直到現在。</p>
<p>最近興登堡總統死了。從客觀地觀察起來，希特勒政權的今後將怎樣呢？在提出這個問題之前，我們先要認清可以制約希特勒政權的命運的重要要素及國内政治諸要素的動向。德國國内有精銳的十萬國防軍，而此十萬國防軍至今仍未被國社黨的宣傳所煽動，依然守着獨立的地位，這是很明顯的事實。稱爲希特勒私兵的突擊隊有二百萬人以上，擁有很大的勢力，但目今已成爲國社黨政權唯一之癌。在這樣的情勢之下勉强支持着，究竟把突擊隊解散呢？還是把國防軍全部改組呢？這是國内政治的第一重大問題。</p>
<p>第二，就是民心的動向。德國民衆現今固然是守着沉默，好像冬眠一樣，但這是决不能永久冬眠下去的，一切言論，行動等的自由，都被壓殺於武斷的獨裁政治之下，而且大部份民衆一點也不信任國社黨政權。同時各種反對黨的組織又是很多，這種思想滲透於民間也非常深刻。另一方面，在國社黨幹部間權勢上的暗鬥，政治意見的紛歧等，於國社黨政權，尤其是希特勒政權，獨裁統治的前途，眞是困難多端哩！</p>
<p>第三，就是與國内政治問題有密切關係的經濟問題。對外貿易方面，因了馬克價格的提高與國社黨政府排外的自給自足主義的貿易政策，已引起各國反德的形勢，因此，對外貿易最近以來愈益不振。自今年一月至五月的入超額達一億七千八百萬馬克，把這個數字與去年同時候的出超額二億六千三百萬馬克的數字比較起來，已可見一斑。失業人數，據政府公佈，自希特勒得到政權以來已减少二百萬餘人，表面看來不能不說是希特勒的成績，但實際情形是怎樣呢？失業人數雖然减少了，而全部工人的工資則銳减，所以失業工人的數目雖然减少，而總工資却反而减低。在這種矛盾的情形之下，工人愈加貧苦，加以生活必需品等價格的騰貴，使全部份的勞動階級不能維持他們的家庭，甚至連個人的生活都顧不周全。這樣，民衆對於希特勒政權的信仰便更加淡漠了。</p>
<p>最後，我們要討論到德國外交關係的危機。德國自退出國際聯盟及軍縮會議以後，更陷於孤立的國際地位。今年六月，希特勒與墨索利尼的會晤，本是爲了想增進德意兩國的友誼關係，一時也盛傳德國今後將脫離孤立的境域而得</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>到有力的支持者了。但兩巨頭會晤後不久，就又發生奥國國社黨刺殺陶爾斐司的叛亂。奥國獨立性的尊重本是德意友交的根本條件，而因此次奥國變亂事件，德意的友交也就更形成對立之勢。這回的事變不但使德意間衝突益烈，卽列國對德意志的猜疑和反感亦將更加深刻。今後的德意志外交形勢將更陷於孤立的地位，是無待諱言的了。</p>
<p>我們檢討德國國内政治問題，經濟問題，外交問題等，任何問題的要素中，都含有重大的危機。國社黨政權將爲世界大戰的導火綫。過去希特勒曾說：「國社黨的天下可以繼續到千萬年之久！」但我們看了上述的情形，竊未敢輕信此言！</p>

<h3 id="c297">父與子的衝突 <a href="#c297" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e297" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">297</a></h3>
<p>— 會慶</p>
<p>在人與人間的矛盾没有根本消滅以前，在每一個時代中，父與子的衝突都是存在的。目前的中國，正在一切矛盾加緊會合的時候，所以這父與子的衝突特别普遍和尖銳。只要我們稍稍留心目前中國的社會情形及家庭現象，便隨處可以找到父與子衝突的例證。父親要擁護舊道德，兒子却要講摩登；父親要穩重，兒子却想大刀闊斧地硬幹；父親要保守，兒子却要前進；……所有這些，不都是目前中國社會非常普遍的現象嗎</p>
<p>然而，這父與子的衝突是怎樣發生的呢？伏洛夫斯基在其批評屠格湼夫的「父與子」時說：「屠格湼夫在自己的小說中對立着的兩個時代所以是分離着，那是因爲與其說是一個是「父」，另一個是「子」，還不如說最初就開始了衝突的，兩個相異的社會狀態的代表的緣故。「父」和「子」的角色，不過只是使二種東西的敵對關係尖銳化了而已。」一點也不錯，父與子的衝突並不是單純的父與子的衝突，而是兩個時代或兩個社會的矛盾的表現。伏洛夫斯基的這段話，不僅是屠格湼夫的「父與子」的正確的評論，，卽用來批評目前中國的父與子的衝突現象，也是很適當的。</p>
<p>目前中國情形雖甚複雜，但其主要的矛盾却是表現於新舊兩個世界，兩個時代或兩個社會的對立中。很顯然的，目前有些人在其生活過程中接受了已成的傳統的世界觀，所以其對現實是肯定的，對於由實生活所發生出來的一切變化與一切新的現象，都是摇着腦袋，認爲不可思議的；反之，另一部份人，則在其現實生活中，在由現實所産生的一切新的變化所給與的不斷刺激之下，使他們不得不抱着新的「偏見」，否定已成的傳統，而頑强地在新的道路上邁進；除此之外，當然也有一些人是居於兩者之間，或者部分地傾向前者或後者的，但這些人却不能獨立的存在，因而也不能超然在新舊兩個世界的矛盾之外。這樣，目前中國社會的矛盾，主要地乃是新舊兩個世界，兩個時代或兩個社會的矛盾，所謂父與子的衝突，主要地卽是這矛盾的反映。</p>
<p>自然，我不是說除父與子的衝突外，新舊兩個時代或兩個社會的矛盾，在别的任何事態中便都没有表現了；不，我没有那樣愚蠢！我明白，在大衆集團的生活鬥爭中，新舊的衝突是比在父與子的衝突中所表現的還要明顯；而且，父與子的衝突只有在大衆集團的生活鬥爭中才可以找到正確的解釋。不過，當我們在討論父與子的衝突時，說這衝突主要地是新舊兩個世界觀的矛盾表現，說這是新舊兩個時代或兩個社會的矛盾表現，恐怕　没有什麽不對的地方吧。</p>
<p>父與子的衝突，在那些道學先生們看來，當然是最不幸的。所以，近來就有人秉承了這些先生們的意旨，主張趕快解决這一問題。怎樣解决呢？他們說道：「除父還就子，或子遷就父以外，别無辦法」。然而，問題却不如人們的腦筋所想的那樣簡單，絶不是隨便拿兩個字眼就可以解决的。</p>
<p>我們已經知道，父與子的衝突，主要地乃是代表着新舊兩個世界觀之矛盾的，如果這個矛盾不能互相「遷就」，那麽，表現此矛盾的父與子的衝突也是絶對不能以「遷就」來解决的。然而，事實告訴我們，無論古今中外，新舊兩個世界的衝突，從未曾以「遷就」來解决過；每一個時代，每一個社會的新舊勢力的矛盾，都是在那矛盾中解决的；具體說來，都是在矛盾的發展過程中，由於新的勢力對舊的勢力的否定而解决的。所以，主要地表現新舊兩個世界，兩個時代或兩個社會的矛盾的父與子的衝突，必然是在這衝突的發展中去得解决，想要以「遷就」來緩和這一衝突者，除表現其畏懼這衝突，企圖阻碍由這衝突所推進的人類社會之進化外，是不會有什麽意義的。</p>
<p>把問題移到了目前的中國也是一樣。假如父與子的衝突在目前的中國正在發展，那這問題也必然會在這發展中解决；而且這解决是促使人類社會進步的。倘若我們不畏懼進步的話，那對於這父與子的衝突，就用不着擔憂，更用不着高唱」遷就呌子「遷就」父，或呌父「遷就」子。</p>

<h3 id="c298">海關檢查員 <a href="#c298" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e298" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">298</a></h3>
<p>— 如月</p>
<p>爲着家庭經濟的壓迫和失業的恐慌，我不得不放棄了中學生時代那顆天眞純潔的心兒，拚命地往這溷濁的社會裏攢，找職業，謀解决生活問題。費了多少心力哀求師友貴戚們我介紹推薦，總算在離家數百里遠的一個海關檢查局裏謀得了一個每月掙得十五元薪水的檢查員的位置。</p>
<p>海關檢查局，在長江上游一個繁華的縣裏，這兒往上可以通到重慶，往下可以直達宜昌，漢口，來來往往的商船每天都可見到。我的職務是蹲在輪船碼頭，等輪船來了，檢查船上有没有人私運違禁品和一般販賣貨物不納稅捐的奸商，或是携帶反動書籍的旅客，學生。</p>
<p>檢查的工作，如果碰着走上水的船隻就比走下水的容易一些，因爲上行船走到這兒，牠至少是經過一兩次檢查機關的，我們只要隨隨便便搜查一下就得了。但下行船到我們這兒，算是第一道檢查的關口（比方由重慶開來的船，在那兒啟椗前只是經過一次很馬虎的檢查），我們的工作上比較就麻煩辛苦了。第一，因爲這兒是有名的川土與嗎啡的輸出口，爲了避稅取巧，士販多愛私販出川的。第二，因爲四川匯兌銀錢出省，每百元常常都差不多要二三十元的貼水，因此一般小商人和出省留學的學生就都喜歡帶着現洋走，（現銀流出，這是省政府嚴格禁止的）。還有就是私運川鹽的了。我們檢查的目標也就專注意在雅片烟土，現洋與川鹽上。在近年來的經濟恐慌與捐稅繁重中，這三種東西，下水船上的一部份旅客，茶房，水手和火夫等，差不多没有誰不喜歡偷偷摸摸地私帶一些的。因爲這般奸人太多了，檢查機關跟着也嚴厲起來，可是任你怎樣嚴厲，這般作奸犯科的人都不曾絶跡，你檢查得愈厲害，他們販運私貨的方法也愈是巧妙，愈是秘密，檢查起來也就愈費心力。比如拿他們收藏雅片一項來說吧，有些旅客他把裝行李的網籃做成兩層底子，在兩層底相隔二三寸高的空框之中塞些雅片進去，更巧妙地是用三兩根小竹子，刨空裏面的節巴，把雅片搓得像麫條樣的，揷入竹兒裏面，再用這種竹兒來扭成網籃的提手，也有把烟膏裱糊在對聯字畫的垂軸裏來混的。比較前幾種都要來得更滑稽，更巧妙的，算是冬季輪船上的人用猪尿包裝着雅片，掛在褲襠裏面的月經帶裏。諸如此類的事情，說來眞是一言難盡。爲着他們這種奇特的行爲，我們不得不更艱苦地去發現他們的秘密，所以輪船一停泊碼頭，我們便好像獵狗追逐野兎似地趕快追上去，翻箱倒篋地搜查，每一個角落，每一件旅客們的行李都仔細地看過，遇着網籃，得用鐵絲戳到底上去，然後取出來，用鼻子聞聞，用口嘗嘗，甚至於船上每一個人的衣服還得要他解開來搜查，有時候，見着態度可疑的人，我們得摸摸她的褲襠，看有没有裝烟的猪尿包與假的月經帶在那兒。</p>
<p>這種煩瑣痛苦的工作，當然使人厭棄，唾駡的，不過，既已吃到這碗飯了，不做這種使人厭棄唾駡的工作又怎麽樣呢？况且凡是一個檢查員，按照局裏的規約，每一個月至少得報功一次（檢查出一次的私貨），若接着兩個月無功可報，飯碗就有被打碎的危險。爲着這種情形，我那能不忍着苦痛兇</p>

<p>狠地去搜查人們，苛索人們，引起人們厭惡我呢！</p>
<p>記得有一個冬天，一連六個禮拜没有一點兒成績，長官以爲我受了商人或是旅客跟茶房們的賄賂，漸漸對我不滿意起來。我發覺了這種情形，大大地着急了。後來遇着船到，不管什麽人，我都要他解開身上的衣服給我搜查，這回偏偏遇着一個住統艙的，又刁又惡的中年婦人，她解開衣服給我摸她的荷包的時候，我不知怎地手下重了一點，觸着她的身體了，她馬上給我幾個耳光，接着又來幾口唾沫，大駡我故意揑了她的奶子。可是她的口水吐在我的臉上，耳光痛在我的心頭，我到底該怎樣伸寃呢？「山不和水鬥，男不和女鬥」，還手於她嗎，絕對不能够，終於我抱着一顆慘痛的心兒，在衆人的哄笑與諷刺之中，輕輕地走開了。</p>
<p>人家說：關稅局檢查員薪水雖低，倒是油水最足的肥缺。可是在我只覺得這樣的檢查員是人間可惡而又可憐的人兒啊！</p>
<p>自然，在上峯壓迫着我們去作惡的情形之下，在鬱悶苦痛的生活之中，我們被磨練成一種兇狠的性情與貪污的行爲。不是嗎，譬如說，正當執行檢查的任務的時候，誰要是不趕快打開箱子給我們看，或是故意同我們爲難，那末，我們會兇狠地駡他，甚至於推他，踢他。爲了要有功可報，在保住飯碗與希望加薪的條件下，我們往往會借題發揮，與吹毛求疵地抓住細小的甚至於僅是可疑的物品來處罰旅客，扣留茶房等。說到貪污吧，遇着三兩個月不發薪水，爲了送禮請客等應酬，爲着自己的鬱悶需要娛樂（自然，我們時常要打牌，喝酒，嫖娼等消遣的），或是爲着家裏的老婆兒女等着寄錢回家去，吃飯，穿衣，你又那能不藉端敲榨，或明放暗縱地受一些私販子們的賄賂，掙一點「外快」呢？全靠薪水嗎，這十五塊錢够什麽？</p>
<p>至於高貴的特殊旅客和他們的「寳眷」這些，檢查員是没有方法與權力去執行檢查的職務的，雖然有時他們所帶的違禁物會在普通旅客的什百倍以上。要是檢查員不識相地驚動了一下那些「寳眷」們的好夢，或竟無意間查出什麽東西來，當衆「出了彩」，那你就不僅是飯碗要「潑湯一響」，而且還會變成什麽犯人的。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Soviet Russia Agrees to Wording of Request <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>To Join League of Nations on Tuesday or Wednesday</p>
<p>French Foreign Minister Signs Formal Request</p>
<p>Future Disputes to be Submitted to The Hague for Arbitration</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Soviet Russian government today announced its entry into the League of Nations, but with a very important reservation. Moscow has accepted the League of Nations' request and agreed to submit any future disputes with other countries to the International Court of Justice in The Hague. However, it explicitly refuses to submit any disputes prior to Soviet Russia's entry into the League of Nations to arbitration. Thus, the hope of some governments to force Soviet Russia to accept arbitration after its entry into the League of Nations has been dashed. The French delegation this morning notified representatives of various countries by telephone, asking them to go to French Foreign Minister Barthou's office to sign the formal request inviting Russia to join the League. The first to sign was French Foreign Minister Barthou, followed by British representative Eden. Subsequently, twenty representatives signed at 11:00 AM. Barthou has also obtained the consent of thirty-three representatives to sign immediately. According to the League of Nations Covenant, a two-thirds majority of the assembly, i.e., thirty-five signatures, is required for the request to be legal. This is no longer a problem. The request can be sent to Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov this afternoon, and his reply can be issued immediately. It is hoped that Soviet Russia's formal entry into the League of Nations can be realized on Tuesday or Wednesday. (National Telegraph, 15th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The telegram inviting Soviet Russia to join the League of Nations is currently being signed at the French delegation's hotel. It is now believed that the signing can be completed by 5:00 PM this afternoon, and the telegram will be sent to Moscow tonight. More than two-thirds of the League of Nations member states have signed, so Soviet Russia may join the League of Nations next Tuesday. On Monday, a new director for the Administrative Council will be elected. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The procedures for Soviet Russia to join the League of Nations can be completed next Tuesday, and formal entry will take place on Wednesday. By noon today, the number of countries signing the request will reach forty, exceeding the necessary two-thirds. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The wording of the request telegram is very simple, stating only that, for the sake of peace, it is hoped that Soviet Russia will join the League of Nations. As for Soviet Russia's reply, it declares its candidacy and agrees to Article 1 of the League of Nations Covenant, which stipulates that countries accepting the League of Nations Covenant without reservation may become members. Soviet Russia's reply also states the view often expressed by Soviet Russian representatives, namely that the League of Nations Covenant must be reconciled with the Paris Peace Pact. It concludes by saying that since Soviet Russia is joining the League of Nations in a spirit of sincere cooperation, it hopes that Geneva will also accept it in the same spirit. The procedures for recognizing Soviet Russia's entry into the League can be handled on Sunday or Monday, completed on Tuesday, and on Wednesday, Soviet Russian representatives can be formally received in the General Assembly. (Havas, 15th)</p>

<p>Czech Foreign Minister Meets with Litvinov</p>
<p>Wording of Request and Reply Agreed Upon</p>
<p>(Geneva) In the evening, the Chairman of the League of Nations Administrative Council, Beneš, accompanied by the Director of the French Delegation Office of the League of Nations, Massigli, met with Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov near Geneva to discuss the wording of the invitation for the country to join the League of Nations and the reply. At 8:00 PM, it was heard that the trend of the three men's conversation was turning for the better. Although the details of the procedural issues still need to be resolved locally in Geneva, mutual agreement can be regarded as having been obtained. Beneš, Massigli, and Litvinov will continue negotiations tonight and tomorrow. Starting next week, the issue of Soviet Russia's entry into the League will be studied by the Political Issues Committee of the General Assembly, and on Tuesday or Wednesday, the General Assembly may vote on the recognition of Soviet Russia's accession. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Yesterday evening, the Chairman of the League of Nations Administrative Council, Beneš, accompanied by the Director of the French Delegation Office of the League of Nations, Massigli, consulted with Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov near Geneva on the wording of the invitation for Soviet Russia to join the League of Nations and the reply. By 12:15 AM that night, it was learned that Soviet Russia and the delegations of various countries had completely agreed on the wording of the invitation and the reply. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The procedures for Soviet Russia's entry into the League of Nations were carried out last night in great secrecy. This agency's special correspondent has learned that the matter has been completely resolved. Last night, the Chairman of the League of Nations Administrative Council, Beneš, and the Director of the French Delegation Office of the League of Nations, Massigli, negotiated with Litvinov near Geneva. After reaching an understanding, they returned to Geneva and met with British Foreign Secretary Simon, British Minister of State Earl, President of the League of Nations General Assembly Sandler of Sweden, representative De Scavenius of Denmark, and representative Pietsch of Arozio of Italy. Sandler and De Scavenius spoke on behalf of the Scandinavian countries, which had previously raised some reservations about inviting Soviet Russia to join the League of Nations, and now also expressed their agreement. The Scandinavian countries will issue invitations in their individual names, and the wording of the joint invitation is also approved. Some specialized programs remain to be decided tomorrow, and the final procedures will be completed as soon as possible so that the issue of Soviet Russia's entry into the League of Nations can be submitted to the League of Nations General Assembly on Monday, and can be submitted to the Sixth Committee that evening or the next day. If so, Soviet Russia's entry into the League of Nations can be approved by the General Assembly on Wednesday. (Havas, 15th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The Turkish side here claims that it is now confident that Turkey will obtain a seat on the Administrative Council. China hopes to obtain the necessary two-thirds of the votes in the League of Nations General Assembly for re-election eligibility, but Turkey is confident that it can thwart this. However, well-informed sources believe that if China obtains re-election eligibility in the General Assembly and then fights against Turkey in the Administrative Council, China will definitely win.

<p>(Berlin) Recently, when the League of Nations Administrative Council voted on the issue of Soviet Russia's accession, Portugal and Argentina abstained from voting. Afterwards, news spread from Germany that Argentina abstained because a certain European country had agreed to purchase a certain quantity of kerosene from Argentina. Recently, the Argentine Embassy in Berlin denied this claim, saying that those who spread this rumor completely misunderstand the nature of Argentina's traditional policies. Furthermore, Argentina's kerosene production only reaches half of its domestic consumption, so there is no surplus to sell to others, so the statement is completely unfounded. (Havas, 14th)</p>

<p>Support Russia's Entry into the League of Nations</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Standing Political Conference of the Little Entente countries held another meeting this afternoon, and then issued a communiqué stating that the political conference of the Little Entente countries had discussed all current issues in detail over the past two days. The important ones were: (1) the issue of Soviet Russia joining the League of Nations; (2) the issue of the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact; (3) the issue of ethnic minorities; (4) various issues related to Central Europe; (5) the relationship between the Little Entente and Italy. The political conference decided to vote in favor of Soviet Russia's entry into the League of Nations. As for the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact, it is believed that it is sufficient to enrich the guarantee of peace and hopes that it can be concluded in a short period of time. The attitude of the Little Entente countries towards the ethnic minority treaties has been repeatedly explained at previous international conferences and is known to the world. It maintains its original attitude. Regarding the Central European issue, the political conference of the Little Entente countries supports the complete independence of the countries in the Danube River basin, advocates that these countries economically approach each other, and implement cooperation with all related countries. The political conference also believes that the peace and order established by the various peace treaties after the European War should be guaranteed by the League of Nations when necessary, which is most appropriate. The communiqué also stated that the policy of the political conference is to establish friendly relations with all countries without distinction. It is very satisfied to see the approach of France and Italy, because the approach of France and Italy means that the Little Entente and Italy can also seek their approach from any point of view. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Greece, Turkey, Yugoslavia, Romania, and other Balkan Pact signatory countries held a meeting this afternoon, chaired by Greek Foreign Minister Maximos, expressing support for Soviet Russia's entry into the League of Nations, which is the same as the attitude of the political conference of the Little Entente countries. Regarding the issue of ethnic minorities, they also expressed their opinions in accordance with the communiqué issued by the representatives of the Little Entente countries. They also began to exchange views on the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact and the Mediterranean Pact. They will continue to talk on Saturday and have also decided to convene a meeting of the Balkan Pact countries in the Turkish capital on October 27 of this year. (Havas, 14th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) A special situation has arisen regarding the issue of the rotating chairmanship of the League of Nations Administrative Council.

<p>(Tianjin) A branch of bandits, about 60 or more people, claiming to be members of Liu Guitang's unit, was discovered between the towns of Yuhongqiao North and Qingzhuang in the third district of Yutian County. They were well-equipped with firearms and had more than 20 horses. They attacked the village, forcing the villagers to cook and provide tea and water, and prohibiting the villagers from going out. Then they searched door to door, and all the valuables were tied up. Later, the Fifth District Public Security Bureau came to suppress them with the militia, and the bandits kidnapped more than a dozen people and fled. (Special Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Zunhua County City suddenly imposed martial law on the 12th, and the city gates were closed. The police and militia were stationed at each gate to check pedestrians entering and leaving. Merchants and people were panicked and closed their shutters. The Chief of Security and the Chief of Police were invited by the County Magistrate to a meeting. Martial law was lifted on the 13th. It is said that the reason was that a certain traitor instigated plainclothes troops to sneak into the county to harass them. When they saw that there were precautions, they escaped.

<h3 id="e23">Sino-Foreign Cooperation in Drug Prohibition <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Courtyard</p>
<p>The source of China's opium scourge originally stemmed from foreign merchants' opium trade after the war, with its toxic flames raging high and causing immeasurable harm. Unexpectedly, in recent years, morphine, cocaine, heroin, red pills, golden elixirs, and other narcotics have also spread all over the place. Their range of transmission even surpasses that of opium, and tracing back to their origins, nine out of ten are illegally imported from Europe, America, and Japan. Today, if we want to eliminate the opium scourge, we must rely on international cooperation. Moreover, curbing the spread of narcotics cannot be achieved by China alone. Facts have proven that most of those engaged in this trade are petty criminals and scoundrels taking shelter under extraterritorial rights and the police powers of concessions. Their methods of smuggling are also constantly emerging, either entrusting transportation to ships flying foreign flags or disguising them as ordinary letters delivered by post. The more cunning ones even set up manufacturing facilities on small boats, moving around unpredictably, secretly producing and selling, resulting in an uncontrollable spread of toxic fumes.</p>
<p>However, with the passage of time, international relations are becoming increasingly close, and the concept of humanitarianism is developing more than ever before. China's opium and narcotic problems have gradually taken on an international dimension and become a concern for the world. As early as 1912, twelve countries, including China, Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands, agreed on the International Opium Convention in The Hague, which also included provisions for restricting morphine, cocaine, and their compounds. The treaty countries occupying concessions, leased territories, and colonies in China were repeatedly urged to bear the responsibility of strictly prohibiting private transportation. Unfortunately, concrete measures were still lacking at the time, and those who sincerely fulfilled their obligations were few and far between. In 1925, the League of Nations' Opium Advisory Committee, in order to promote The Hague Convention, re-established the Geneva Opium Convention, but its content was still too vague. It was not until the establishment of the "International Convention for Limiting the Manufacture and Regulating the Distribution of Narcotic Drugs" in 1931 that there was a concrete plan to follow. This treaty came into effect on July 9th of last year, and China officially ratified it on January 10th of this year, because its special situation required cautious consideration.</p>
<p>What is particularly gratifying is that the League of Nations' Opium Advisory Committee recently passed China's proposal and it has been adopted by the Executive Yuan, issuing a notification to countries enjoying extraterritorial rights in China to implement the following measures:</p>
<p>(1) Nationals of those countries who participate in the private manufacture or transportation of narcotics in China shall be deported and not allowed to return to China.</p>
<p>(2) Those countries shall enact laws to determine the punishment for nationals of those countries who privately transport opium or participate in the private manufacture of narcotics in China.</p>
<p>(3) Foreign ships sailing in China that are found to be used for the private sale of opium shall have their protection revoked immediately.</p>
<p>Looking at these three points, the content is concise. If they can be implemented in conjunction with the 1931 Convention, it would be excellent. However, observing the current situation, we still dare not be too optimistic. First, the League of Nations Executive Yuan's recommendations on international economic and social affairs lack the legal authority to compel countries to comply. Whether they can be implemented and to what extent are all questionable. Second, Japan, which has withdrawn from the League of Nations, will certainly not be willing to follow the crowd and agree to the resolutions of the League of Nations. Moreover, Japan has not yet joined the 1931 Convention. If Japan continues to go its own way, then high-sounding talk of Sino-foreign cooperation in drug prohibition will be just empty words. Third, China's coastline is exceptionally long, making smuggling extremely difficult. Smuggling across land borders is even easier. Where there are huge profits, people will flock to it, and if defenses are lax, anything will be done. Fourth, in Shanghai alone, policies come from multiple sources, and it has long been a hub for the transit of opium and other narcotics. Many of the sales firms are located in concessions, making suppression difficult. These people are well-connected and easily escape once alerted. Under these five difficulties, what is the future of Sino-foreign cooperation in drug prohibition? One can imagine more than half of the problem.</p>
<p>Although, even a fool would not stop eating because of choking. Moreover, the drug prohibition cause is related to the life and death of the entire nation. We should redouble our efforts and act decisively. How can we stop in the face of difficulties? Now that we have this League of Nations resolution, which is of great moral assistance to us, we should actively devote ourselves to normal diplomatic negotiations and the promotion of international public opinion, pursuing both tracks simultaneously. Although Japan is not bound by the 1931 Convention, its obligations under the 1912 Hague Convention cannot be easily erased. If the entry of drugs from puppet Manchukuo, the spread of toxic fumes in Eastern Hebei, and the rampant sale of opium by Japanese and Taiwanese residents in Fujian are all ironclad evidence with clear responsibilities. Regardless of whether Japan has any sincerity to repent, we should always seriously question them to fulfill our duty to save the nation and seek survival. As for the private smuggling situation between Yunnan and Vietnam, it is also said to be serious. In the Tengyue and Yongchang areas on the Yunnan-Burma border, ignorant border residents are deceived by others and often cause border markers to be secretly moved due to our drug prohibition efforts. The public sale of opium in the colonies of the British, Dutch, French, and Portuguese in Southeast Asia, condoning Chinese residents to freely smoke opium in order to collect huge opium tax revenues—all these facts should also be discussed separately with the governments of the countries concerned to seek satisfactory solutions.</p>
<p>As for how China itself will fulfill its obligations under the Convention, how to promote the implementation of drug refusal work, and how to assist the good intentions of other countries, all depend on the joint efforts of government agencies such as the Opium Prohibition Committee and important national organizations to continue their efforts and strive for success. Only then can foreigners no longer have an excuse to ridicule us, and our representatives attending international opium prohibition conferences will no longer be embarrassed by cold and ruthless statistics.</p>

<h3 id="e26">All American Wheat Purchased on Credit Will Soon Be Shipped <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the Ministry of Finance, the American wheat purchased on credit, since it was shipped from the United States on November 18th of last year, originally amounted to US$6 million, purchasing 322,198 tons of wheat, and it was stipulated that all of it would be shipped to China by the end of June of this year. In addition, 250,000 tons of wheat flour were purchased, valued at US$4 million, and it was also required to be shipped at the same time. When the American wheat was shipped to Shanghai, the market price of wheat flour was only 1.9 yuan per bag, which was extremely unprofitable. Therefore, the American wheat was shipped first and sold to various flour mills in Shanghai, with an average price of 4 to 4.2 yuan per bag, which was equivalent to 77 yuan per ton. The ships used for transportation were 23 tons chartered by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and 20 ships chartered by the American Bondin Lelin, totaling 43 ships. If there had been no labor unrest in the United States, this American wheat would have arrived in China in full long ago. Now, there are still three ships that have been delayed, about 27,000 tons. As for the amount that still needs to be shipped, it is estimated to be 8,500 tons, which is the 42nd ship. There is also the last ship, with an estimated 8,700 tons of American wheat. Yesterday, we received a telegram saying that it was already on its way and could arrive on the 15th. When that batch arrives in Shanghai, all 322,198 tons of American wheat will be completely transported to China. The selling price is approximately 22.55 million yuan. There are still 250,000 tons of wheat flour, which can continue to arrive in Shanghai. Recently, the price of Shanghai wheat flour has risen to as high as 2.657 yuan. In addition to a portion of this borrowed wheat being unloaded in Shanghai, the rest will be shipped directly to Tianjin for sale in North China, which can slightly save on transportation costs. North China's wheat flour market is very smooth, and domestic wheat flour is insufficient to meet demand. Therefore, this large amount of American flour will be supplied to the people for food. After these 250,000 tons are deducted, at the current market price, they are worth over 24 million yuan. Combined with the selling price of wheat on the market, the total is approximately 77 million yuan. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Judicial Yuan's interpretation of the doubts about the Criminal Law of the Army, Navy, and Air Force was sent to the Ministry of Military Affairs yesterday, stating that the meeting for the unified interpretation of laws and regulations resolved the following: (1) The term "in the army" in the Criminal Law of the Army, Navy, and Air Force refers to troops after mobilization or troops in wartime formations, and troops engaged in suppression during times of incidents and disturbances. The term "front line" refers to those directly confronting the enemy and guarding the key points of our offense, defense, and alert. (2) Article 14, "joint perpetrators," refers to a group of people jointly carrying out a riot for a common purpose. Article 72, "gathering of the multitude," requires an act of gathering first. Therefore, there is a distinction between instigators and those who echo and follow the crowd. Article 16, "gathering of the crowd," refers to a multitude who gather with the intention of contact, and those who gather can be increased at any time. As for Article 84, "forming a gang," it refers only to a specific group of people. Furthermore, accomplices refer to fellow gang members. The above-mentioned types have different natures, so the degree of punishment is also different. (3) The "retaliation" in Article 44 shall be judged in accordance with Article 41. (4) Article 47, "harboring opium," shall include the three items of manufacturing, transporting, and selling. (5) The term "military supplies other than weapons and ammunition" in Article 78 shall include all items supplied for military use. (6) If a military person is accused of a crime, and there are incidental civil lawsuits and procedures involved, since the Law of Military Justice for the Army, Navy, and Air Force has no regulations and the Code of Criminal Procedure has no explicit statement that it applies to other laws, it is difficult to handle according to the various articles of Chapter 9 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. A corresponding letter is hereby sent to your ministry for your reference. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>

The Ministry of Finance believes that adding a surcharge would hinder customs duties and is difficult to approve. As for the funding, it is approved to follow the example of the funding for the Yantai Silk Improvement Project, exempting the silk goods exported from Guangzhou Customs from transit tax and using the collected donations to expand the funding for the ground. A preliminary budget of expenses should be submitted first, and the funds can only be allocated after being approved by the central government. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Telecommunications Conference resolved that the principle for long-distance telephone calls is three minutes per call. Yan Renguang, Director of the Telecommunications Department, said that this resolution is because the duration of each long-distance telephone call in various countries is three minutes. The same is true for Guangdong, Hong Kong, and other places in China. In the future, when international long-distance calls are connected, it will be difficult if the call durations are different. Moreover, it will also be difficult to calculate when communicating with Guangzhou in China. According to past statistics, most call durations do not exceed three minutes. Therefore, it has been decided that three minutes will be the standard, and it will be implemented after international calls are completed. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>

<p>Rubber Restriction Act Rejected by Parliament</p>
<p>Bangkok The Siamese rubber quota, submitted to Parliament today for approval in accordance with the international plan, was rejected by a majority vote. As a result, the government immediately resigned. This development may cause the Siamese King, who is currently traveling in Europe, to return home quickly. The government that has now resigned was formed after the coup on July 1, 1932. The result of the coup was that Siam changed from an autocratic system to a constitutional monarchy. The Siamese Parliament's rejection of the rubber quota has been met with sympathy from the London rubber industry, which believes that Siam's request for a larger quota is justified and expects that the quota will be revised soon to suit the country's production capacity. When rumors of the Siamese Parliament's decision first spread, the London rubber market fell, but the price rebounded after it was not confirmed. The London rubber industry believes that if the Siamese quota is gradually increased, it will not cause a major hindrance to the overall statistics. (Reuters dispatch on the 15th)</p>

<h3 id="e48">United States Arms Investigation <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Part of the Testimony is Not Released</p>
<p>Fearing International Disputes</p>
<p>(Washington) Part of the testimony obtained by the Senate Committee investigating the arms trade is now prohibited from being released, as at least five countries have protested against the published events. The investigators held a secret meeting with Secretary of State Hull and Secretary of Commerce Roper this morning before continuing the investigation. Chairman Nye then stated that the committee had no intention of being perfunctory and had not received such a request. The committee is now moving forward, and no one has said that the committee is proceeding too hastily. Today, a representative of the Constant Company, Landemote, told the investigation committee that in 1933, the joint representatives of Constant Company and the British company Bunnemann in Shanghai suggested that the two companies should separately negotiate with the United States State Department and the British Foreign Office. Landemote also said that in 1932, he had visited the Deputy Secretary of State with Senator Townsend, and then sold a patented method of manufacturing light gas to Mitsui &amp; Co. for use by Japan. At that time, Mitsui &amp; Co. was engaged in activities similar to war preparations, but Constant Company heard from Mitsui &amp; Co. that this manufacturing method was not of major importance to military purposes. Land also said that Constant Company had received a report that although the Treaty of Versailles prohibited Germany from manufacturing explosives, Germany was still manufacturing large quantities of highly explosive materials. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, and other countries may have lodged or are about to lodge strong protests regarding the Senate committee's investigation into arms sales. Secretary of State Hull discussed this matter with Senate Committee Chairman Nye this morning. Although the two said afterward that the investigation would continue and would not slacken, it seems that the committee is proceeding cautiously in view of the protests from various countries. This can be seen from two things: First, a representative of the DuPont arms company in China presented the committee with several letters stating that he had sold arms to China in 1932, and some Chinese officials and generals received commissions. The committee refused to disclose the names of these people, which is evidence of caution. Second, the Argentine government built an arsenal in 1933 and had originally signed a contract with a German company. DuPont lobbied Argentina to cancel the original contract and let DuPont undertake the project. The correspondence regarding this matter was submitted to the committee by the DuPont representative in South America. Committee Chairman Nye said that this telegram could not be published in its entirety, otherwise, "it is feared that it would cause a backlash in the politics of a certain country in the Americas," which is the second evidence that the committee's attitude is gradually becoming more cautious.

<p>The Union Attempts to Test the Strength of the National Recovery Administration through This Strike</p>

<p>Washington, Providence - Mediation negotiations have completely stalled, so the strike situation is extremely dangerous today. Although the Rhode Island legislature refused yesterday to consider authorizing Governor Green to use troops to protect textile factories, it is now meeting again to reconsider the matter. Serious riots previously occurred in the area of Woonsocket, resulting in two deaths and five injuries, with three of the injured in critical condition and over four hundred with minor injuries. Order is currently being maintained under the bayonet, and a second riot is brewing. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>(New York) - The strike situation in Rhode Island has eased slightly, but disturbances occurred today in the town of Burlington, North Carolina. The National Guard and demonstrators clashed, as four hundred strikers attempted to prevent a cotton mill from opening. Military police attempted to disperse them, but when that proved ineffective, they used tear gas to achieve their purpose. During the clashes, five demonstrators were bayoneted, fortunately with minor injuries. Four people were arrested. According to many opinions, the union intends to use the strike to test its power over the National Recovery Administration. Some cotton mill owners have admitted in private conversations that other industry leaders are pressuring cotton manufacturers to reject the demands of the textile workers, because if the cotton mills give in, the labor unrest will spread to other industries. According to today's news, the authorities are now considering an order to reduce working hours in factories nationwide without changing wages, in order to ease the current labor unrest. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>(Washington) - Since the textile workers' strike began, General Johnson, head of the National Recovery Administration, spoke for the first time today, saying that before the textile industry code was signed, he had reached an understanding with McMahon, president of the United Textile Workers of America, and that the current strike is a complete violation of that understanding. Gorman, chairman of the strike committee, is currently campaigning among other unions to prevent the import of textiles, in order to strengthen the strike's momentum. The strike committee today called on transportation workers not to handle imported textiles. (Reuters, 15th)</p>

<p>(New York) - According to Sullivan, the purser of the "Morro Castle," the ship was carrying 1,000 liters of flammable paint, which made it easy for the fire to spread. Some sailors testified that the ship's lifeboats were not adequately prepared for immediate use, and that the officers did not fulfill their duties, so no orders were issued when the fire broke out. A passenger stated that he glimpsed flames at 12:45 AM, but the radio distress signal was not sent until 3:15 AM. Other passengers said they did not hear any alarm at that time. The federal prosecutor issued a rebuke to the Ward Line, the owner of the ship, saying that it was trying to incite the crew to conceal the truth during questioning, which hindered the investigation. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>(New York) - The Congressional committee investigating anti-American propaganda movements has recently decided to expand the scope of its work to include an investigation of the "Morro Castle" disaster.

<p>Madrid - The Spanish Samper Cabinet, which was originally scheduled to submit its resignation on Sunday, decided today to postpone it temporarily. However, because the current cabinet has lost the support of the parliamentary majority party, resignation is ultimately unavoidable. However, Parliament is scheduled to reconvene on October 1st. Although the current cabinet has decided to make a final struggle, political circles still anticipate that the current cabinet will fall first. The current cabinet is doing its best to maintain order, and all kinds of political demonstrations are prohibited. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>

<p>The Import Volume of Iron Scrap Increases Sharply</p>
<p>(Tokyo) - Japan's iron and steel industry remains busy this year. According to a survey by the Japan Iron &amp; Steel Co., Ltd., from January to July of this year, the import of iron scrap from abroad reached 700,000 metric tons. After July, the import volume has increased further. If futures are included, the total amount of iron scrap this year could reach 1.5 million metric tons. The reason for this is that Japan lacks pig iron, so it uses iron scrap to manufacture steel. The import volume this year is much higher than the 1.04 million metric tons last year and 550,000 metric tons the year before, which has attracted considerable attention in industrial and business circles for its future prospects.

<p>Full Reform Plan to Be Implemented Next Year</p>
<p>(Tokyo) - Regarding the issue of the Japan-Manchukuo Economic Conference, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Army Ministry are focusing on studying the details of its structure. The basic guidelines are as follows: (1) In order to promote Japan-Manchukuo economic cooperation and review the business supervision of special joint Japan-Manchukuo ventures, and to make timely recommendations to the governments of both countries, a Japan-Manchukuo Economic Conference will be permanently established in Changchun. (2) This conference will be established by treaty between the two countries and will be under the supervision of the governments of both countries.

<p>(Tokyo) - The personnel for the newly established Bureau of Manchukuo Affairs are now awaiting the legalization of the decided reform plan. The Cabinet and the Army Ministry will strengthen coordination, but the Army focuses on substance, not form, so its views on the Bureau are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Bureau's excessive powers may lead to duplication of effort in its relationship with the Army. Therefore, it is desirable that active-duty military personnel fill any position as Director-General or Deputy Director-General. (2) When adopting a "Grand Director-General" system with a minister-level figure serving as Director-General, it is appropriate to have a major general-level active-duty military officer serve as Deputy Director-General to be in charge of substantive matters. (3) If the Director-General holds real power, a lieutenant general-level active-duty military officer should be appointed, and a civilian official should be appointed as Deputy Director-General, etc. Therefore, it is more strongly opposed to adopting a "Grand Director-General" system to expand the organization of the Bureau than the balance between the military commander of the ambassador with full powers and the Minister of the Army. (Dentsu, 15th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) - The Japanese government passed the reform plan for the Manchukuo organs on the 14th. However, regarding the Director-General and Deputy Director-General of the Bureau of Manchukuo Affairs directly under the Cabinet, the government advocates appointing a military officer as Director-General and an active-duty military officer as Deputy Director-General, but the military department advocates appointing a civilian official as Director-General and a military officer as Deputy Director-General, allowing the Deputy Director-General to hold real power. However, its advocacy is not strong, and it also reveals the intention of appointing a powerful figure who can understand the actual situation in Manchuria as Deputy Director-General. (Kahren News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) - The most noteworthy aspects of the reform plan for the organs stationed in Manchukuo, which was decided by the Cabinet meeting yesterday, are the organization of the Bureau of Manchukuo Affairs and the concurrent appointment of the Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army as the Director of the Administrative Affairs Bureau. According to its regulations, (1) one of the Director-General or section chiefs of the Bureau of Manchukuo Affairs shall be filled by an incumbent military officer; (2) it shall be clearly stipulated by order that the Chief of Staff of the Army shall concurrently serve as the Director of the Bureau of Administrative Affairs when necessary; (3) when the Counselor of the Embassy concurrently serves as the Director of the Bureau of Administrative Affairs, the Counselor shall be primarily responsible for foreign-related matters, consular affairs, and foreign ceremonies.

<p>(Tokyo) - For the sake of implementing its policy towards Manchukuo, the Cabinet has established the Bureau of Manchukuo Affairs. Because it is necessary to have close contact with the various organs stationed in Manchukuo, it has decided to appoint a current army general as its Director-General. The most promising candidate is Lieutenant General Koiso Kuniaki, the current commander of the 5th Division. Other candidates also being mentioned are Lieutenant General Yanagawa Heisuke, commander of the 1st Division, and Lieutenant General Tatekawa Yoshitsugu, commander of the 10th Division.

<p>Due to Budgetary Reasons, the Bureau Will Be Established First</p>
<p>(Tokyo) - The reform plan for the organs in Manchukuo is generally scheduled to be implemented from April of next year. However, the Army hopes to realize it within this year. Although full implementation is relatively difficult, it expects rapid implementation of what can be implemented under this year's budget or what is not related to the budget. Therefore, the government will accommodate the demand to a considerable extent and intends to first engage in the formation of the Bureau of Manchukuo Affairs. (Dentsu, 15th)</p>

<p>(Dalian) - After the Kwantung Government received the telegram from the Ministry of Colonial Affairs late last night regarding the decision on the reform plan, Chief of Internal Affairs Bureau Hika and other executives immediately convened a meeting. Police Chief Oba, who is currently in Tokyo, also sent a telegram instructing them to be patient and careful and to stay at their posts. Therefore, the attitude of the leadership seems to be inclined to observe the situation temporarily and make plans for a proper solution. Therefore, this morning at 10:00, all government officials gathered in the meeting room, where Chief Hika reported the situation and expressed the hope that everyone would be self-disciplined. (Dentsu, 15th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) - The 10,000 employees of the Kwantung Government have become indignant because the reform plan of the Ministry of Colonial Affairs was not adopted, and they have decided to resign en masse and submit their resignations. The Army is deeply regretful about this issue, considering that the duties in Manchukuo cannot be neglected even for a day due to the actual situation, and the Kwantung Government employees have actually taken this action, which will have a major impact on security. Therefore, it sincerely hopes that the police officers of the Kwantung Government will exercise self-restraint, and in order to prepare for any eventuality, the Kwantung Army Command and the central department are studying how to fill the security gaps. Therefore, a security plan has recently been completed. (Dentsu, 15th)</p>
<p>(Dalian) - More than 10,000 officials of the Kwantung Government have expressed dissatisfaction with the government's compromise plan to reform the Manchukuo organs.

<p>American Cotton - The New York cotton market did not move at the opening. Subsequently, the price fell slightly due to some hedging sales. As the price fell, buying interest arose.

However, many parties settled in large quantities, causing the market price to fall sharply. The price at 10:40 AM was four pounds lower than the opening price.</p>

<p>(Hangzhou) The National Sericulture Improvement Association established two autumn silkworm guidance centers in Linqu, Shandong Province, this autumn to guide the experimental rearing of autumn silkworms. According to reports from the centers, the young silkworms are developing extremely well, with the earliest nearing their third molt. The work is expected to be completed before the end of this month. The association believes that Shandong Province's climate is highly suitable for silkworm rearing. Investigations show that the province can produce approximately 10,000 piculs of silk annually, but most are inferior varieties with poor quality. The association plans to use over 1.3 million sheets of improved varieties next year to carry out improvements. (15th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e97">Investigation of Japanese Invasion of Emerging Enterprises in Northern Manchuria <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>South Manchurian Enterprises Entirely Controlled by Japanese</p>
<p>Japanese Intent on Managing Northern Manchurian Enterprises</p>
<p>Changchun Correspondence: The Japanese are implementing various enterprises in Manchuria according to their established economic invasion plan, developing extremely rapidly. According to recent investigations, the Japanese have established nine companies with capital exceeding 500,000 yuan in South Manchuria and six companies with capital below 500,000 yuan. Recently, they have established flour, cement, sugar, and alcohol companies in Northern Manchuria, urgently seeking to completely control the operation of Northeast businesses and the absorption of raw materials to achieve their further economic invasion. Details of the three major companies in Northern Manchuria and other planned enterprises are listed below:</p>
<h3 id="e98">Flour Company <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese-Manchu Flour Co., Ltd., with the Mitsui and Mitsubishi groups as the investment center, and with shares from the Toto, Okura Trading Co., Japanese Flour and funds from the pseudo-Central Bank, raised a total capital of 2 million pseudo-yuan. They purchased the Dongxing Flour Mill, run by the former Guanqian Northeast Three Provinces Bank, as the first and second flour factories. The flour mill company established by Heilongjiang Guangxin Company in Suihua County was also purchased by the Japanese as a flour factory. It was established in June of this year and began operations on July 24. The president is Japanese Mr. Matsumoto Shinpei, the clerk is Mr. Nakazawa Seiji, and all technicians are Japanese. They are currently engaged in factory reform. The daily and nightly production capacity is 2,500 bags for the first factory, 700 bags for the second factory, and 1,500 bags for the Suihua factory. This is the situation of Japanese control over flour milling in Northern Manchuria.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Cement Company <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the establishment of a cement joint-stock company, the Japanese have made repeated plans since the September 18th Incident, but they could not be realized due to the strength of the volunteer armies in various places. Recently, the Japanese, such as Mr. Kakuda, president of Toho Electric Power, and Mr. Morishima, Consul General Shiguang, have actively promoted the establishment and raised a capital of 5 million pseudo-yuan. Products will be available for sale in the spring when the ice melts. The estimated mineral production of raw materials is over 30 million tons, which can be called a limestone mountain in the mountains. Therefore, the Sankeshu Wharf factory can mine 50,000 tons annually. Northern Manchuria currently needs 30,000 to 35,000 tons, which is increasing year by year. In the future, urban planning, river construction, railway projects, and general construction will require 30 million tons in three years, and the prospects are still unlimited.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Alcohol Company <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese-Manchu joint-run Datong Alcohol Co., Ltd. has a capital of 1.67 million pseudo-yuan and was established in November of last year. The company is located in Majiagou, Nangang, Harbin. The president is "Manchu," and the vice president is "Japanese." The product is new sorghum wine, which can be used as a beverage and fuel. They are currently researching the manufacture of other types of alcoholic beverages to expand sales, and the names and capital amounts of other important enterprises currently planned are listed below (unit: 1,000 yuan):</p>
<p>Company Name Capital</p>
<p>North Manchurian Sugar 2,000</p>
<p>Greater Manchurian Hushi Beer 10,000</p>
<p>Taiyo Trading Company 500</p>
<p>Manchurian Sugar 10,000</p>
<p>Japanese-Manchu Flax Textile 6,000</p>
<p>Enterprise Trading Exchange 2,000</p>
<p>As for the Japanese-Manchu Flax Company, the head office is located in "Fengtian," and branch offices are located in the direction of the Laha, Binbei, and Northern Manchurian Eastern Lines. The head office is responsible for the purchase of raw materials and the sale of products. Other enterprises with capital under 500,000, such as Xingguo Flour, Songhei Transportation Company, Toyo Beer, Japanese-Manchu Brewing, Taihua Company, and the Department of Chemical Industry, are also in the process of planning.

<p>Financial Department Secretly Investigates Excessive Land Tax Levies in Various Counties</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: After the Guangdong Financial Department abolished the old system of cash grain and changed to levy a provisional land tax, various counties in Chaozhou and Meixian strictly implemented land measurement. Chao yang, Fengshun, Dabu, and other counties have completed the measurement and will implement inspections and provisional land tax collection from September 1st. Other counties that have not completed measurement will complete it by the end of this month. From October 1st, the entire province will change to levy a provisional land tax, abolishing the former cash grain system entirely and uniformly changing to levy land tax. It is also reported that the Financial Department recently received secret reports from the people that the current land tax in various counties is levied as high as six or seven yuan per mu. The Financial Department's actual income is 1.8 yuan, and the rest is used up by local guard, autonomy, education, and various self-reliance items. The names of the items and the sources and uses of the funds are not stated and are not submitted to higher-level agencies for approval. The Financial Department has dispatched multiple secret investigators to various counties to investigate the amount of embezzlement and its use due to the unauthorized actions of local agencies. Moreover, the abolition of cash grain and the handling of local guards have been carried out vigorously in the inland counties. Robust men are drawn for training from time to time, and graduates from the Yantang Military Academy are transferred to various armies as platoon leaders. A platoon leader is drawn from each company in various armies as the squad leader in the local guard, so as to ensure thorough training.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Anhui Salt Transfer Shore Dispute <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Provincial Government Resolves to Stop Datong Workers from Intercepting Transportation</p>
<p>Transportation Office Builds Central Salt Warehouse in Datong</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The transfer of Anhui Huai salt's guiding shores from Datong to Anqing has led Datong loading and unloading workers to gather thousands of people to block river transportation, fearing its impact on their livelihoods, creating a severe situation. The Wuhu Anhui Shore Transportation Bureau, fearing the expansion of the dispute and the occurrence of accidents, specially sent General Affairs Section Chief Yu Quji to the provincial capital to negotiate solutions with the provincial government. Mr. Yu returned to Wuhu yesterday. The provincial government is determined to maintain responsibility for the 200 tickets of Huai salt being transported to Anqing and has telegraphed the Tongling County Government and the Datong Public Security Bureau to stop the Datong salt workers from gathering to cause disturbances at any time and to prevent them from acting out of line. Therefore, the transfer of Huai salt to Anqing should not cause further problems recently. On the one hand, to help Datong workers and the market, the Transportation Office has decided to build a central salt warehouse in Tong. The scope of the warehouse is extremely large. The benefits to the Datong market in the future will be even greater than before. They have now purchased the former Shuili Bureau's building as the warehouse site. Once the handover is clear, construction can begin. The Transportation Bureau has also announced the reasons for setting up a warehouse in Anqing and the measures for relief in Datong. It is claimed that Anqing is 180 li from Datong, while Qianshan, Dongliu, Taihu, Wangjiang, Zhizhi, and Susong counties upstream are even further from Tong. In the past, due to the regulations, Anqing was not allowed to open a shore for salt sales, and these counties had to travel hundreds of miles to purchase salt. Since last winter and spring, the Transportation Office changed to transport 50 tickets of Huai salt by inland waterway directly to Anqing for trial sales. People in the upstream counties were delighted by the convenience of daily consumption. When the trial salt was sold out, Zhang Yinmosen, chairman of the Huaining County Chamber of Commerce, and Xu Leisheng and other representatives of the seven counties, repeatedly telegraphed to request continued operation of Anqing's water transport to benefit the people's food supply. This is the actual situation of the people's food supply. The merchants and people of the upstream seven counties are unwilling to go to Tong to buy salt due to geographical restrictions. Moreover, Taihu County borders Yingshan and Huoshan counties in Anhui and Henan provinces, and Zhizhi County borders Qimen in Zhejiang. Therefore, before the central salt warehouse in Datong is completed, in order to stabilize the food supply of the upstream counties and save the declining tax revenue, it is necessary to set up a salt warehouse in Anqing to avoid the opportunity for cheap salt from Anhui, Henan, and Zhejiang to rush into the market. After the completion of the Datong central general warehouse, all salt in Tongling, Qingyang, Shitai, Guichi, Huaining, Qianshan, Susong, Wangjiang, Taihu, Zhizhi, and Tongcheng counties can be taxed and released from the warehouse. Datong's future prosperity will be ten times greater than today. (13th)</p>

<p>Many Cave-ins at Kaifeng North Flood Control Second Dam</p>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: The Xia Kuajiao of the Qi Baotou Dam under the jurisdiction of the Wenwu Flood Seven Forts in the Yellow River in Henan Province was washed away by backflow water from 10 PM to 12 PM on the 9th, with a cave-in of more than a zhang. The earth core has been exposed, and the situation is dangerous. The Shangbei Sub-bureau immediately instructed the target soldiers to rush to protect it. However, the river situation in Wuzhi Flood River has also been changing at any moment recently. The top impact point goes up and down from time to time, and the situation is dangerous. The top impact point of the second dam of the Five Forts moved at noon on the 10th, and the Xia Kuajiao was cave-in. Also, one stone pile on the lower head of the earth dam of the Six Forts and two stone piles on the upper head of the seventh dam of the Eight Forts were all eroded by the flood and exposed the cave-in. In addition to supervising the target soldiers and hiring coolies to move stone squares for protection and resistance, the Shangbei Sub-bureau specifically telegraphed the Yellow River Affairs General Bureau to report the emergency. Also, engineer Zheng Yaoxi telegraphed the Yellow River Commission, saying that the water level had dropped in recent days, the river situation had risen, and the main stream was directly impacting the nineteenth fort six dams and the twentieth fort head two dams in Kaifeng North Flood, but it was not as tense as the previous days, and lead wire cages had been used to load stones and fortify it. However, the height was insufficient. If there is no major flood, it will be sufficient to resist. The revetment project below the second dam has many cave-ins and is being processed to move the stored stones from other places to carry out protection. The new stones from Gongxian were shipped in two boats on the 6th, but there have been no more shipments to date. Although additional coir has been purchased for use, we are still hoping that the stone boats will come quickly. The Chuan gou below Xibatou is still passing water, and the rush is very urgent. All other projects are quite stable. (12th)</p>
<h3 id="e104">Shandong Library Newly Purchases Bronze Vessels of the Wu Family of Hai feng <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Will Compile and Publish Illustrated Catalogue of Bronze Vessels of the Haiyue Lou</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Wu family of Haifeng (now Wudi) has the largest private collection of ancient bronzes in Shandong. It started with Wu Zibi (Shifen), and his son Zhongyi continued it. With high ranks and generous salaries, several generations were serially linked. At the same time, Xu Yinlin and Chen Fuzhai and others were appraising it. All bronze vessels, precious seals, clay seals, bricks, tiles, and stone inscriptions were the richest collection. Their seals have been copied into the Shuangyu Hu Zhai Yin Cun. The clay seals have been compiled with Chen's "Examination of Clay Seals." There are also "Jugu Jinwen" and "Shiwen" two books. The "Jinwen" in nine volumes is the richest collection of bronze vessel inscriptions, and the textual research is also very accurate, which is known at home and abroad. The collected bronzes have been prepared for inclusion in the "Jugu Lu Jinwen". The house has ten halls, known as the Ten Rooms. All gold and stone literary objects are stored in the rooms. Wu Zhongyi has been an official in Henan for a long time, and no one in his family manages them. His servants sometimes stole gold and stone from the rooms for sale. The golden Buddha given by Empress Dowager Cixi was also among the stolen items. Later, Wu Zhongyi was dismissed from office and returned home. Fearing that he would thoroughly investigate the lost items, the family burned the Ten Rooms, falsely claiming that it was a divine fire. All the gold, stone, and heavy objects were turned into ashes. After the house was burned, they counted the remaining gold and stones and still hid them at home. In the spring of this year, a part of the bronzes suddenly wandered into the Jinan market. After the Provincial Library learned about it, they purchased them in many ways. After two months, all the scattered bronzes were successively included in the library, a total of twenty-two pieces, all with inscriptions. Twenty pieces are seen in the "Jugu Lu". The remaining two Han artifacts are seen in the "Qin Han Jinwen Lu" and other books. Unfortunately, after being burned, the color is no longer the same as before, and there may be some damage. The molten gold juice is sometimes on the device. Fortunately, the inscriptions are complete. The Shi Jun Fu is the best. The museum now plans to collect about a hundred pieces of bronze ware with inscriptions collected before and after and compile them into a collection of Haiyue Lou Yiqi catalogues. Recently, in addition to receiving a part of the Wu family, it has also purchased ten newly unearthed bronzes from various places and two sections of the Han Xiping Stone Classics, all of which are valuable. Now I will explore and record the catalogue of each device separately.</p>

<p>The library has also purchased a new masterpiece. Some students from Baihejiang Town, in the northern township of the county, collected money to purchase a set of "Wanyou Wenku" in the autumn of the eighteenth year, and then initiated the organization of a library to store books. In the autumn of the nineteenth year, they raised funds and then recruited workers to build library houses. In April of the twentieth year, the library houses were completed, and the opening ceremony was held, and it was named Qingpu County No. 1 Library. At the time of the opening, in addition to the Wanyou Wenku, the masterpiece books also borrowed all the twenty-four histories of the Haiqin Lou Collection, and all the four collections of the Yangsu Xuan Collection of the Zhonghua Book Company, as well as other magazines, novels, jurisprudence, medicine, etc., were available. In the twenty-first year, they raised money again to purchase all the four series of books from the Commercial Press. In the twenty-second year, in order to promote the sages and add glory to the town, they added plates to the two masterpieces "Xiting Wenchao" written by Wang Yuan, and "Song Bin Quan Ji" written by Xu Xiqi, and published them into books, which were donated to universities, etc. to exchange books to increase culture. Recently, they have raised huge sums of money to subscribe to the entire "Gujin Tushu Jicheng," which will be published by the Zhonghua Book Company. With a library with an annual recurring expenditure of less than 400 yuan, can purchase masterpieces every year. The enthusiasm of local people for culture can be seen here.</p>

<p>In order to drain sewage, the Taihua Paper Mill in Huguan caused resentment among citizens, resulting in an arson incident in which the factory was surrounded and raw materials and rice straw were burned. Now Taihua has refused mediation by a third party, and the Trade Union Branch and other groups have telegraphed the Nanchang camp and the provincial and county authorities, requesting an investigation into the instigator. The county government has instructed Taihua Factory to resume work as soon as possible and wait for a legal solution. As for the originally proposed diversion of waterways and installation of water pipes, Taihua is required to complete them within one month. The district chief and the chief of the public security sub-bureau, who did not report and suppress the incident before it happened, and were unable to make every effort to stop it temporarily, have been punished separately. The instigators will be strictly arrested and sent to the court for investigation. As for the slogan arson, an investigator has been sent, but there is no evidence. Therefore, the county government said that the arson may not have been premeditated.</p>

<p>Provincial Bureau Sends Commissioners to Investigate Disputes over Tobacco and Alcohol License Taxes</p>
<p>Tobacco and alcohol merchants in Wuyi County previously submitted a complaint to the provincial and county governments about the Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Collection Office's overcollection and excessive levies. They submitted their old licenses and taxes to the Chamber of Commerce to show their firm opposition. After receiving the report, the Provincial Bureau sent Lu Baoqi to Changzhou to work with County Commissioner Li Yuting to thoroughly investigate. During the 13th and 14th, Lu and Li visited various tobacco and alcohol merchants to investigate and persuaded the merchants to take licenses from the tax office in accordance with the regulations. If there are any problems, local agencies can mediate. The most important issue of license grade can be determined by the Provincial Bureau. However, it is difficult to solve the situation as the tax office and the tobacco and alcohol merchants hold different opinions. Mr. Lu returned to Suzhou on the afternoon of the 14th to report and ask for instructions, and then come to Changzhou to resolve everything.</p>

<p>Tobacco Exchange Appeals Against Tax Increase</p>
<p>Various shops in this county, including soy sauce and wine businesses, wine and soy sauce shops, tobacco exchanges, cigarette businesses, and native tobacco businesses, have traditionally entrusted their respective trade associations to pay the tobacco and alcohol license taxes to the tax office on their behalf. This autumn, the shops followed the usual practice of submitting the tax payments and old licenses to their respective trade associations for collective payment. However, the director of the tax office, Zhu Jinzhang, demanded that the tax amount for this season be doubled compared to previous years, which led to no result. The trade associations then returned the tax payments and old licenses to their respective member shops, instructing them to go to the tax office to pay on their own. When the shops, following the tax amount of previous years, went to the tax office with the payments and old licenses, they were all detained by the tax office, which sparked a backlash. The shops reported the situation to their respective trade associations for assistance. The trade associations, considering the severe drought and the economic downturn in all industries, believed that the tax office was disregarding the hardship of businesses and imposing exorbitant levies that merchants and the public could not afford. Therefore, they submitted petitions to Party and government institutions and organizations, requesting relief. Yesterday, more than one hundred tobacco exchange shops, including Fuxing, stated that Zhu Jinzhang is actually a pseudonym of Zhu Jin, who originally made his fortune by handling taxes and regards exploiting tobacco and alcohol merchants as his only means of accumulating wealth. Today, what he enjoys and squanders are all the blood and sweat of tobacco and alcohol merchants, treating them as meat on his chopping board and fish in his pot. At a time when rural areas are bankrupt and disasters are frequent, and the people are struggling to survive, Zhu Jinzhang disregards the lives of the people, imposes exorbitant levies, and only cares about his own family's happiness, ignoring the suffering of others. The merchants and the public cannot afford this illegal tax increase. Therefore, they jointly petitioned the tobacco exchange association to appeal for relief, vowing to perish together if their goal is not achieved, and submitted the tax payments and old licenses for this season to the trade association for safekeeping. The situation is extremely serious. At the same time, the Wujin tobacco exchange industry, because the director of the tobacco and alcohol license tax collection office in that county, Zhu Gu, is also a pseudonym of Zhu Jinzhang and also uses the pseudonym Zhao Qian, who also holds the position of director of the fourth district of the Jiangsu Province Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Bureau, illegally imposed exorbitant levies and enriched himself at the expense of the people. Therefore, they filed a complaint with the provincial bureau. The provincial government has now dispatched Commissioner Lu Baoxi to Changzhou to investigate and handle the matter, it is said.</p>

<p>Since the Wuxi City Land Price Declaration Office began implementing household declarations on September 1st, instructors have been leading police officers to investigate and fill out forms household by household, starting from the South Gate area. However, most households do not understand the truth, and the instructors are filling out the forms on their behalf and ordering them to affix their seals. Progress has been quite smooth in half a month. However, since learning about the land price declaration, residents have been shocked by the upcoming land value tax and land value tax. They have been holding meetings to discuss solutions. Furthermore, the County Funds Property Office, the Chamber of Commerce, the First District Office, the town leaders of the urban areas, and citizens Tang Wenzhi and Hua Wenchuan, along with more than 270 others, based on their previous request and the instructions of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the provincial government, as well as Chairman Chiang's recent instructions to Jiangsu Province regarding the six points of Jiangsu governance, telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Nanchang Headquarters, stating that Wuxi has been handling grain collection since the early years of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty, and more than seventy years have passed, with many changes in personnel and circumstances. Moreover, the urban areas are particularly intertwined, and the ownership of land is often unclear, making it difficult to declare. It is requested that land consolidation and land survey be prioritized to comply with the principles of national construction and Chairman Chiang's recent instructions to Jiangsu Province. Yesterday, they telegraphed the Nanchang Headquarters and the Jiangsu Provincial Government, requesting that the land price declaration be suspended.</p>

<p>Patrol Officer's Home Robbery Case Solved</p>
<p>The residence of Shao Qiubai, the current patrol officer of the Second Public Security Precinct, was suddenly robbed on the night of the 13th. Two individuals first used deceptive means to enter the house, then seized 125 silver dollars and a gold bracelet before fleeing. The director of the Public Security Bureau paid special attention to this matter, as the home of a police officer had been robbed, and it happened in the urban area. He ordered the investigation team to apprehend the culprits within a time limit. After receiving the order, the team leader immediately ordered the detectives to intensify their efforts. On the evening of the 14th, they discovered a lead and dispatched detectives to lie in ambush at the Dahua Hotel. They apprehended the main culprit, Wang Zhenshan, at the Changyuan Tea House and immediately took him to the bureau. According to his confession, there were other accomplices. Wang had previously served as a patrol chief in the First Public Security Precinct. The robbery of Shao's residence was also motivated by resentment.</p>
<p>Renovation of Scenic Spots Completed</p>
<p>This county was ordered to renovate scenic spots for the opening of the Transportation Exposition. The county government convened local figures to form a scenic spot renovation committee and allocated 3,400 silver dollars in public funds to repair mountain roads, ancient tombs, and build pavilions. The work was divided into the West Mountain and North Mountain areas. The mountain roads were all built into 3-meter-wide avenues, and the stone steps were leveled. Construction began two weeks ago and has now been completed. However, the street section outside the North Gate, Martyrs' Street, Zhang Family Ancestral Hall, has a rugged and uneven surface and needs to be repaired, as proposed by Committee Member Yu Jiusi.</p>

<p>The areas of Dali Village, Shenbao Township, and Gaogui Township, east of Linze Town in the Fifth District of this county, are currently occupied by bandits. They have a large number of firearms, and the bandits are wearing military uniforms, making it difficult to distinguish them from soldiers. Yesterday, the bandits, in formation, went to Jiangjiagou in Beisha Township, swarming into the home of wealthy farmer Yan Sanmazi, looting for a long time. They then kidnapped Yan, his mother, and his children, four people in total, leaving a message demanding 40,000 silver dollars for ransom, to be negotiated in Dingjiazhuang, otherwise they would tear up the tickets and set fire to the place.</p>

<p>License Section Chief Accused of Illegal Conduct</p>
<p>Zhou Dajiao, the license section chief of the County Anti-Smoking Committee, violated the regulations and forced smokers to register in person, not allowing them to appoint agents. As a result, poor smokers in various townships and towns could not afford the travel expenses and hesitated to come forward, leading to a sparse registration office. Furthermore, the section chief accepted bribes from smokers, changing Class A licenses to Class B licenses. Yesterday, Chen Yuebo, Li Shaoyan, and others listed many instances of misconduct and requested the Provincial Anti-Smoking Committee to thoroughly investigate and severely punish him.</p>

<p>Lingjiabang, located at the intersection of Chengxi Township, Jiaxing, and Jiashan, has only a dozen or so households, all of whom are middle-class families, making them targets for bandits. The day before yesterday, in the middle of the night, more than ten bandits, armed with fast guns and sharp blades, with white cloths wrapped around their heads and black charcoal smeared on their faces, broke into the homes of Wang Heshang, Wang Ernan, and two other families, ransacking chests and cabinets and looting at will. After checking the missing items, the losses were significant. The incident was immediately reported to the Tianning Basic Team, and the district chief, accompanied by platoon leader Chen, went to the scene for investigation. The bandits had already disappeared. The matter has been reported to superiors for strict apprehension.</p>

<p>Low-Lying Roads Flooded, Knee-Deep</p>
<p>Fortunately, No High Tide, Water Recedes Quickly</p>
<p>Wall Collapse on Zhoujiazui Road Injures People</p>
<p>The recent continuous autumn rain is reminiscent of the plum rain season. Yesterday morning around 10:00 AM, there was a heavy downpour, with alternating periods of rain and cessation. The rain became even heavier in the evening. As of this morning, the rain has not stopped. Low-lying areas on various roads have turned into swamps. The water depth on North Sichuan Road, Laobazi Road, Zhejiang Road, and other places is about a foot deep. Fortunately, there were no hurricanes or high tides yesterday. The accumulation of water in various places was purely due to the inability of the sewers to discharge the water. Therefore, around 11:00 PM, the water gradually receded. Otherwise, the water accumulation would have been even higher, and the water would not have receded so quickly. The following are the details of the situation at that time, as investigated by reporters from this newspaper:</p>
<h3 id="e119">Water Floods Steps of Three Companies <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Last night, during the heavy downpour, reporters from this newspaper traveled by car to various roads for inspection. The Bund area was relatively high, and it was low tide, so the roads were not flooded. The water accumulation in front of the Public Works Department on Fourth Road was five or six inches. The same was true for Zhejiang Road, Guangxi Road, and other places. The water at the entrance of the Tianchan Theater reached the stone steps, making it very inconvenient for audience members to enter the theater, so business was slow. The situation was similar on Second Road and Third Road. The entrance of the Grand Theater was higher, so it was not flooded, and the audience members were still crowded, with both upper and lower levels fully occupied. The water around the Three Companies area on Nanjing Road had flooded the steps. A few more inches, and there would be a risk of water damage to the large glass window advertisements. The construction site of the former Tianchan Theater had become a vast expanse of water, turning into a large pond. People waded through the water in various flooded areas of the roads, and cars were like ships, with water splashing everywhere. Good-natured teenagers and mischievous children held umbrellas and went barefoot, chasing each other in the water, which was very lively.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Route Six Trolleybuses Temporarily Suspended <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The water depth near the intersection of Baoshan Road and Jielu Road, and the intersection of Laobazi Road and North Sichuan Road was about a foot deep. The Route Six circular trolleybuses were forced to suspend operations due to the flooding of the tracks. Small cars were also unable to start. Public buses and Route One and Two trolleybuses risked driving, driving very slowly in deep water. Rickshaws took advantage of the scarcity of transportation and charged exorbitant prices. The areas at the end of North Sichuan Road, such as Shigaota Road, had also become a swamp. Various dance halls and food shops near North Sichuan Road had sparse customers and were virtually closed. The French Concession and Nanshi areas were relatively high, so there was less water accumulation.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Water Accumulation at the Intersection of Zhejiang Road and Nanjing Road (Photo by Qichang) <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<h3 id="e122">Various Companies Strictly Prevent Water Damage <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The Huangpu Bund and nearby Zhongchuan Road, Jiangxi Road, Yuanmingyuan Road, Museum, and other banks and companies took extra precautions against water damage because yesterday was Saturday and today would be a day off. For example, those with lower-level offices added hollow iron pillars to both sides of the windows and layered thick wooden boards within the iron pillars, filling the gaps with putty or lime so that they could be removed when they returned to work on Monday. Those without lower-level offices completely blocked the gaps under the floor with putty to allow air circulation. Temporary sandbag piles were everywhere. The Shanghai Telephone Company and others completely blocked the windows with putty, even though they had lower-level offices, in order to protect the machinery.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Situation in Various Places in Zhabei <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Reporters went to various places in Zhabei for inspection last night. Arriving at Guangfu Road, they saw that the tide in the Suzhou River had risen greatly. The river water was level with the bank in the low-lying areas from the New Garbage Bridge to the New Big Bridge. The ships in the river appeared to be docked on the shore. At that time, there was a heavy downpour and thunder. When they arrived at the entrance of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau on Changan Road, the water accumulation in the middle of the road formed a river because it could not be discharged in time. Shops and homes used signboards and door panels to cross the water. Then, they passed through Huasheng Road and Datong Road to the Sun Temple Railway Crossing. The wasteland there had turned into a vast expanse of water. The fields on both sides of the Zhongxing Road Quanwan Guild Hall and the Republican New Road had also become a swamp. The terrain on the Zhongxing Road and other roads was higher, so it was clear at a glance, with few pedestrians. The area around the back of the Yong'an Company warehouse and the front, back, left, and right sides of the Xijin Guild Hall B House had also become a river. Heading south through Yongxing Road and Qiujiang Road to the north end of the Han Bridge, the water accumulation there was very deep.</p>

<p>The continuous autumn rain in this port has brought the temperature down to within 80 degrees. Bedding is needed for sleeping at night. However, the rainfall is still not comparable to the average amount in previous years. According to the Observatory yesterday, rainfall began in this port on the 11th, with a rainfall of 8 millimeters. On the 12th, it was 21.9 millimeters, on the 13th, 10.8 millimeters, and on the 14th, 7.1 millimeters. There was no report on yesterday's heavy rain. From January 1st to the evening of the 14th of this year, the total rainfall was 555.7 millimeters, which is more than half the average annual rainfall of 933.3 millimeters. Moreover, most of the rain each year falls in July. Now that it is after September, it is difficult to predict whether the rain will continue to fall to this half.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Overview of the Ministry of Finance's Implementation of the Abolition of Exorbitant and Miscellaneous Taxes <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The Committee for the Consolidation of Local Taxes Compiles Implementation Report</p>
<p>Provinces Prepare Local Budgets and Report on Land</p>
<p>Regarding the abolition of exorbitant and miscellaneous taxes in all provinces and cities across the country, Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi stated when he met with reporters from various newspapers the day before yesterday that progress had been made step by step and had achieved considerable results. He also stated that all implementation details had been successively announced by the Ministry of Finance's Committee for the Consolidation of Local Taxes. It has been learned that the committee has now compiled the third implementation report, which contains detailed reports on the abolition of exorbitant and miscellaneous taxes and the determination of local budgets in various provinces and cities. The reporter from New News Agency has extracted the main points as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e127">Determining Local Budgets <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Consolidating local finances should be based on the determination of local budgets. The budgets for the 23rd year of the Republic for the counties in Jiangsu Province have largely been determined. Zhejiang Province has also convened county heads in groups to review and approve the estimated budgets for each county. Shaanxi, Hubei, and other provinces are convening county head meetings to prepare county budgets, which is also a major topic of discussion. Shanxi Province has approved the budgets for each county for this year, reducing them by more than 6 million yuan. Chahar Province has formulated 16 articles for handling local budgets in each county, which are based on the Ministry's regulations for handling county and city local budgets and key points. The Ministry is reviewing and forwarding them for implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Unifying Tax Collection Agencies <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Consolidating local tax collection should focus on unified collection and disbursement. Henan Province has established a unified collection office for business tax and slaughter tax. Anhui Province is planning to establish a local tax bureau. Jiangsu Province has established miscellaneous tax collection offices in various counties. Fujian Province is also considering selecting locations to establish county finance bureaus. Although these measures still require careful discussion and gradual implementation, this reform will make it easier to comprehensively review tax collection. All system improvements and personnel training will be easier to centralize.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Handling Land Reporting <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the land reporting case, Zhejiang Province has requested to continue handling land survey and consolidation of map registers by region. Jiangxi Province has requested information on the ongoing aerial survey. The Ministry has responded to both, following the provisions of Article 25 of the outline promulgated by the Executive Yuan, and instructed them to investigate and handle the matters separately. If they do not comply with the previous regulations, they should expedite the reporting. The four counties of Yixing, Jiangsu Province, have already begun handling the reporting and have completed it ahead of schedule. On September 1st, a meeting was convened with the county heads of Jiangdu, Taicang, Tongshan, and other counties to thoroughly comply with the outline promulgated by the Central Government and continue handling the reporting. The committee dispatched experts to attend the meeting. According to reports, Anhui and Henan provinces have either established reporting offices or are consulting with provincial land administration agencies to plan in detail. Hebei and Shaanxi provinces will also carefully plan the implementation at the administrative group meetings.</p>

<p>Several provinces and cities have reported the abolition of exorbitant taxes and the reduction of surcharges. The matters related to local compensation have been handled by the local authorities. As for the matters related to the central government, such as tobacco and alcohol license taxes, since July 1st, when the responsibility for handling them was transferred to the local authorities, various cities have reported that they have taken over and consolidated them, and tax revenues are very buoyant. The Ministry has now dispatched personnel to conduct on-site investigations to determine whether the abolished items have been genuinely stopped and whether the compensation funds have been properly allocated. The central government will base its policy of approving and allocating compensation funds on the results of the on-site investigations and the extent of local efforts.</p>

<p>Since Turkey is Competing as a European Country,</p>
<p>Then Asia Should Give China a Chance for Re-election</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce issued a declaration regarding the re-election of non-permanent council members of the UN Council of Ministers, stating: At this session of the re-election of non-permanent council members of the International League of Nations Executive Council, our country's representative Guo Luojin has detailed the importance of China's position in the international arena and the faithful sacrifices it has made for the League of Nations over the years, expressing that friendly countries should give China another chance to be elected, so that it can do its utmost. We believe that these claims are fair and reasonable and represent the unanimous demands of the people. Now, in the capacity of citizens, our association still wishes to make some statements. The League of Nations is an organization of universal nature, so it is an immutable principle to fairly distribute its representatives according to region. Since 1926, when the Executive Council members adopted the system of distribution by continent, Asia has occupied two seats, Europe has occupied eight seats, and the Americas have occupied four seats for permanent and non-permanent council members. Although it is not stipulated in the Covenant, it has become the unwritten constitution of the League of Nations. Turkey is China's oldest friend and its newest friend. We deeply admire and are very hopeful that it can become a pillar of the League of Nations and make efforts for it. However, Turkey, due to its historical and diplomatic relations, is really centered in Europe. Therefore, in its petition this time, it frankly stated that it considers itself a European country, just like the Russians whose land spans Europe and Asia, and all countries recognize it as a European country. Now that Japan has already withdrawn from the League, if there is another change in the seat of non-permanent council members, then Asia, which has the largest area and the largest population in the world, will not be able to participate in the organization of the Executive Council. This is indeed an unprecedented change since the founding of the League of Nations and is greatly contrary to the principle of universality and fairness. This is not only regrettable for the Asian countries but also regrettable for all the member states of the League of Nations. We therefore earnestly hope that all member states of the League of Nations will maintain the system of distribution of League of Nations council members by continent and give China a chance for re-election.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Minister of Finance Kong Denies Borrowing to Purchase Military Supplies <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Cotton and Wheat Loans are Used Entirely for Production and Construction</p>
<p>12.5 Million Yuan Has Been Used</p>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi denied yesterday the report by the Washington Congressional Committee Investigating International Arms Trade that cotton and wheat loans were used to purchase military supplies, saying that when the Chinese government signed the cotton and wheat loan agreement, the Central Political Conference decided to use it for China's production and construction. To date, 12.5 million yuan has been used, and its uses are as follows: 8.4 million yuan for the National Economic Committee to engage in construction, 3.8 million yuan for the recovery of bandit areas, and 300,000 yuan for disaster relief in Sichuan. The remaining funds have not been used. Kong also said that the National Economic Committee has also resolved to use cotton and wheat loans for production and construction, designating them for the construction of highways, improvement of hygiene, improvement of Chinese silk, relief of Chinese yarn, tea, fuel, and construction in Jiangxi and the Northwest. According to a Washington AP dispatch, US Congressional International Arms Trade Investigation Committee Chairman Mr. Nye announced that when China successfully negotiated a large cotton and wheat loan with the United States in 1932, China exchanged some cotton and wheat for military supplies from Italy. Kong's above remarks were probably made in reference to this.</p>

<p>Overseas Chinese who were expelled and repatriated from Japan, in batches arriving in Shanghai, specially elected representatives Chen Fengqing, Xia Yongchang, Yang Zhanhong, and three others to go to Beijing to petition the central government and report the process. Chen Fengqing and the three have returned to Shanghai at 7:00 AM yesterday. The reporter from New News Agency specially went to inquire about the process of petitioning, and the details are as follows:</p>

<p>According to Chen Fengqing, after we arrived in Beijing, we first went to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to petition. Chairman Chen personally received us, explained the association's relief plan for overseas Chinese, and gave us 15 yuan each for travel expenses. Then we petitioned the Central Party Headquarters and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, since the Japanese expulsion of overseas Chinese occurred, it has repeatedly made representations to the Japanese side. Now, it will continue to conduct serious negotiations. All the expelled overseas Chinese deeply hope that the government will negotiate with the Japanese side to have the confiscated property returned. Chen also stated that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission have both made instructions and passed them on to all overseas Chinese for their information.</p>

<p>Opening Today</p>
<p>Since its completion, the Beijing-Shanghai Highway long-distance telephone line has undergone a period of unofficial testing. The results showed that among the six pairs of telephone lines, the phantom circuit of two pairs provided very clear sound quality. Therefore, the Jiangsu Long-Distance Telephone Administration of the Ministry of Communications, to facilitate transportation along the line, specifically requested and received approval from the Ministry to open the telephone service for business starting today (the 16th). All rates have also been approved by the Ministry and filed for record.</p>

<h3 id="e140">### Two Exchanges Merged Yesterday <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Employees of the Merchandise Exchange Dismissed with One Year's Salary</p>
<p>Gold Exchange to Hold Shareholders Meeting This Afternoon</p>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, the long-brewing merger between the gold department of the Merchandise Exchange and the Gold Exchange was implemented yesterday. The Merchandise Exchange was established on July 1, 1920 (Year 9 of the Republic), and has been in operation for 14 years. It dealt with a wide variety of commodities, including securities, gold, cotton yarn, grains, and hides, hence the comprehensive name "Merchandise." Later, the exchange was affected by the global economic depression, leading to a decline in business. Therefore, the "Merchandise" designation was cancelled, and part of the margin fund was merged with the Gold Exchange. It is reported that, in terms of the merger, the Merchandise Exchange, besides 25 brokers who were incorporated into the Gold Exchange through a lottery, the majority of the brokers were dismissed. As a result, many brokers have been switching professions or closing early in recent days. Regarding the rumor that the Merchandise Exchange staff would join the Gold Exchange to gain experience, this is not true. All employees of the Merchandise Exchange have been dismissed. Leaders such as directors and chairmen have also sought their own livelihoods. However, the members of the council, considering the hard work of the employees, trainees, and servants for over a decade, have granted each of them one year's salary as severance pay. It is also heard that the Gold Exchange has decided to convene an extraordinary shareholders' meeting this afternoon (Sunday) at 2:00 PM at the market to discuss important matters such as the conclusion of the merger, ratification of the contract, amendment of the articles of association, and increase in capital.</p>

<p>Since the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway Long-Distance Bus Company started issuing new shares, the response has been enthusiastic, and the entire share capital of one million yuan has now been fully subscribed. With all preparations now in place, construction of stations along the route has begun. A preparatory meeting was held on the 12th at the preparatory office on Beijing Road, attended by promoters such as Wu Tiecheng and over a dozen others. After Shen Baixian reported on the progress of the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway project, the various preparatory committee members reported on the subscription of shares. It was then resolved that the inaugural meeting would be convened at 2:00 PM on October 12th at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<h3 id="e144">### Municipal Chamber of Commerce Appeals to Ministry of Finance to Revise Ink Tax Assessment <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Must Conform to Ink Merchants' Selling Prices as the Standard</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a petition to the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: "Regarding the matter of submitting a petition: On the 14th of this month, we received a letter from the Ink and Brush Industry Association stating, 'Our association's ink industry originated in the Southern Tang Dynasty and was originally based in Huizhou. Since the opening of maritime trade, most have relocated from Huizhou to Shanghai to establish factories for manufacturing, to supply the needs of the entire country. In the late Qing Dynasty, ink and brushes were considered important tools for promoting culture. Aside from taxes on raw materials, donation and tax registers specifically designated ink and brushes for special tax-exempt treatment. The ink tax began in 1913 (Year 2 of the Republic). At that time, the price of ink was 50 to 60 taels of silver per 100 catties, but customs assessed the value at 80 taels for taxation. Merchants accepted this reluctantly during the warlord period. Later, when the price of ink fell to 40 taels per 100 catties, the tax rate was still levied based on 80 taels, an injustice beyond compare. In recent years, with the abolition of the tael and the adoption of the yuan, the price of ink is only 50 to 60 yuan. When reporting taxes, customs sometimes used 60 yuan as the tax rate, and sometimes calculated based on 80 taels, resulting in inconsistent tariffs that disrupted the business. This has a significant impact on operations. Furthermore, in the four northeastern provinces and Korea, Japan has increased tax rates, creating obstacles. Since domestic exports cannot be preferentially exempted from taxes to provide assistance, how can we excessively high prices and heavy taxes to destroy the livelihood of ink merchants? Therefore, we specifically request that your esteemed chamber forward this matter to the Shanghai Customs Office, stating that the export tax on ink must conform to the selling price of the ink merchants, or else the assessment should not exceed 60 yuan per 100 catties, so that the declining ink industry may have a chance to survive.' After reviewing the information, it is reasonable to request that the Ministry review the situation. Since the revision of the tariff regulations, the export of national ink has changed from 7.05% of the value to 5%. In principle, ink merchants seem to have reduced their burden, but because the price of ink has decreased while customs assessments remain the same, the actual tax burden on merchants has increased. Although Article 3 of the Provisional Regulations on Export Taxes states that exporters who are dissatisfied with the prices set by customs may protest to the Customs Commissioner within 20 days, according to the situation described in the association's letter, the overvaluation is not accidental but occurs almost every time. Ink merchants cannot be compared to government agencies or other organizations and do not have personnel dedicated to writing official documents. They mostly endure in silence. Therefore, this relief measure cannot be widely effective. Based on the information presented above, it is appropriate to request that the Ministry review and approve an order to the Customs Office to mediate the current prices and revise the assessment to avoid excessive harassment. This would be in the public interest."</p>

<h3 id="e151">### Navigation Cooperation Plan Drafted <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Submitted to the Ministry of Communications for Review</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Navigation Design Committee, jointly established by the Shanghai Shipping Association and the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, was ordered by the Ministry of Communications to draft a navigation cooperation plan to reduce competition among industry players and strengthen shipping capabilities. Since its establishment in mid-April, the committee has agreed on the basic principles of the plan and tasked a specially formed expert committee with drafting the plan. The Ministry of Communications has also dispatched Gao Tingzi, Director of the Shipping Administration Department, and Director Peng Hu to attend as on-site representatives. It is reported that the cooperation plan drafted by the committee has been completed after five months of research and discussion. The plan was approved at an extraordinary plenary committee meeting this past Tuesday (the 21st) and will soon be submitted to the Ministry for approval. Peng Hu has also submitted a report to the Ministry on the details of his attendance at the meetings. The Design Committee's work is now complete, and it is awaiting instructions from the Ministry on whether to continue its existence.</p>
<h3 id="e152">### Difficulty in Establishing Maritime Court <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, after the Executive Yuan approved the establishment of the Maritime Dispute Resolution Committee under the jurisdiction of the Shipping Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, the Shanghai Shipping Association argued that the committee's functions were limited to mediation and arbitration, similar to the existing Ship Collision Dispute Resolution Committee. Therefore, the association strongly advocated to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry the establishment of a maritime court to specifically adjudicate ship-related cases. According to information obtained by reporters from the Shipping Administration Bureau, the establishment of a maritime court is very difficult and may not be approved for some time. Although the Maritime Dispute Resolution Committee is similar in nature to the Collision Committee, its scope is broader. In addition to ship collision disputes, all maritime disputes can be accepted. Compared to the existing setup, it is more complete. Once the committee is established, the Collision Committee may be abolished.</p>
<h3 id="e153">### Investigation of Disaster Situation in the Fourth District of Liyang <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>This year's drought has been most severe in Liyang County in Jiangsu Province. Among the six districts of Liyang, the fourth district is the most severely affected. In order to seek immediate relief, the people of the district organized a begging group and appointed representatives Rui Mengzhou, Tang Xiuzhang, Chen Hongcai, Shi Jiagen, and Shi Jincheng to go to the Wuxi-Shanghai area to appeal to philanthropists. They also sent letters detailing the disaster situation. Charity groups in Wuxi and Shanghai have now appointed Li Juncikai, Shi Junxiangchen, Xu Junyili, and Li Junzongyuan to visit the district on the 10th of this month. When District Chief Rui Baoyuan heard that the committee members would arrive at Nanduzhen by car from Liyang City, he hired a small car and sent personnel to meet them. After arriving at Nanduzhen, Li Jun and the others rested briefly and switched to small cars to travel through Qiangbu and other places. Along the way, they saw continuous stretches of white fields and withered seedlings, causing them to sigh. In Qiangbuzhen, they saw a man named Ji Shan from Jiangbei who, due to starvation, had committed suicide by hanging. Feeling compassion, they immediately provided 12 yuan for the cost of a coffin. Along the way, old people, women, and children begged for food in endless streams. Li Jun and the others gave out corner tickets or silver dollars as requested. Even if they were not begging but were determined to be genuinely poor, they gave what they could to ensure that no one was left empty-handed. At 2:00 PM, they arrived at the town where District Chief Rui and Police Chief Qiu, along with the town chiefs and business leaders, were waiting to welcome them. After Li Jun and the others got out of the car, they were led by the District Chief to the District Office for a warm reception. In the evening, the District Chief invited the committee members to a discussion meeting at the District Office. Attendees included representatives from the begging group, town chiefs, and Qiu, Chief of the Public Security Bureau in the town, as well as Tang, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce. Li Jun and the others advocated setting up factories to provide porridge, so that every drop of benefit could reach the disaster victims. They agreed to set up four porridge factories (Shangpeibu, Shangxingbu, Tangjiaqiao, and Qiangbu). After the meeting, the clock struck eleven, and they retired to the District Office. The next morning, accompanied by representatives of the begging group, they went to Dongba to purchase relief rice. It is said that they still needed to go to Liyang City to attend a banquet hosted by County Magistrate Chen to discuss matters further. Li Jun and the others can be described as generous and tireless.</p>
<h3 id="e154">### Shipping Administration Bureau Investigates the Bao Hua Ship Incident <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The Ping An Company's Bao Hua ship ran aground outside Sanhe Port, causing the ship to list sideways on the sea. Passengers on board were unable to escape from the cabins, resulting in dozens drowning in the sea. The ship's stewards and laborers also fell into the sea and died, and their bodies have not yet been recovered. Afterwards, the shipowners reported to the company that everyone was busy trying to save the ship and that they did not know the exact number of people who fell into the sea. However, according to people on the ship, no more than four passengers drowned. Only one of the passengers who fell into the sea was able to cling to an empty bamboo basket thrown overboard by the ship. The waves carried him to Yonglong Port, where he was fortunate to be able to swim and save his life. However, he had drifted 16 miles out to sea. It is unknown what happened to those who could not swim. It is said that most of the people who fell into the water were hardworking people from Sanhe Port and Niutou Port who were disembarking. After receiving the company's report, the Shipping Administration Bureau determined that the incident involved a commercial ship and decided to launch a thorough investigation. They will strictly investigate the cause of the Bao Hua ship's grounding, whether it could have been avoided, and the total number of passengers who died on the spot. It is necessary to emphasize the importance of human life. As for the cargo that was thrown overboard during the emergency and the loss due to water damage in the ship's cabins, the company has notified the cargo owners. Yesterday, the Ping An Company ordered the Bao Hua ship to resume its normal route to Chongming. It is not yet known whether the company will provide compensation to the family of the deceased steward Liu Zichang and the workers. Furthermore, the ship's purser is named Dong Chunfang. Yesterday's report stating that Li Yaoting was the company's general manager was incorrect.</p>

<h3 id="e161">The Cai Yangqi Case Awaits Resolution Through Foreign Negotiations <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The First Special Court Held Another Hearing Yesterday</p>
<p>Defendant Lang Zuyin Still Refuses to Appear</p>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Court accepted a case during the summer involving Lang Zuyin, a Chinese detective of the Lao Zha Police Station, who was accused of using electric shock to injure Cai Yangqi. The court held nearly ten hearings, but because the defendant Lang Zuyin did not accept the summons and refused to appear in court for interrogation, the trial could not begin. Three months have passed, and the case remains unresolved. This is the first thorny case handled since our country recovered legal rights in the Shanghai concession and established a formal court. Yesterday at 2:00 PM, another hearing was scheduled for the case. The presiding judge, Liu Yugui, followed the usual procedure and issued a summons in advance, ordering the bailiffs to deliver it to both the plaintiff and the defendant. However, when the hearing time arrived, the defendant Lang Zuyin still did not surrender. The situation was no different from previous hearings. Cai Yangqi sat in the waiting seat, and another defendant, Bao Defu, was also present. Since the plaintiff was Cai Yangqi's wife, Judge Liu summoned Cai's wife to the plaintiff's stand and informed her that the case had been submitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for negotiation with the relevant country's ambassador, but there were no results so far. Therefore, the trial could not proceed. Once the issue was resolved, another hearing would be scheduled, and a summons would be issued. The woman heard the notification and left with her husband. Bao Defu and the lawyers representing the case also left their seats. Therefore, when the case can proceed smoothly depends on the results of negotiations in Beijing.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Red Pill Kingpin Zhou Shengfa Escorted to Nanchang for Legal Proceedings <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Aboard the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiang'an Ship</p>
<p>Heavily Guarded by Military Police</p>
<p>According to Guominshe, the Municipal Public Security Bureau intercepted a shocking case of 4.2 million red pills at the North Railway Station on February 4th of this year. Subsequently, on February 23rd and 24th, accomplices Wang Weicheng and Zhao Zuoting were arrested at the South Railway Station and Xiaomu Bridge in Longhua and sent to the Songhu Garrison Command for strict interrogation. The suspects all confessed to manufacturing and selling red pills and have been executed by firing squad. The main culprit in the case, Zhou Shengfa, was arrested by the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Detective Team Leader Lu Ying, along with detective squad leader Ling Tianpeng and Chinese and Western detectives from the Public Concession's Gordon Road Police Station, on August 10th at Yuanyuan Lane on Gordon Road and sent to the Garrison Command for joint handling. Details have been recorded in this newspaper. It is now known that the case has been repeatedly investigated by Tao Baichuan, the Chief of the Military Law Department of the Garrison Command, who found the evidence against Zhou to be conclusive and the case to be serious. Therefore, he telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Nanchang Headquarters to request instructions on how to handle the matter. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed the department to escort Zhou to Nanchang for legal proceedings. After receiving the order, Commander Wu ordered Deputy Li Duchu to lead many members of the investigation team and seven military police officers to escort Zhou aboard the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiang'an Ship at 12:00 PM on the 13th to Nanchang Headquarters for legal proceedings. When Zhou disembarked, the port and the journey were heavily guarded. It is said that the Garrison Command only allowed Zhou's wife to talk to Zhou for a short time on the afternoon of the day Zhou was escorted, and they were seen weeping together.</p>

<p>Recovering the Shengshunli Property</p>
<p>Construction Cost of 700,000 Yuan</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus have decided to build their own building because the rent paid for office space is too high. The Ministry of Railways has approved the plan, and the architectural drawings have been drafted. The construction cost is 700,000 yuan, which will be allocated from the employee welfare fund. The construction site is selected at the eastern end of the North Railway Station, where the Shengshunli buildings will be demolished and rebuilt. According to sources from the Railway Bureau, the site covers more than 20 mu and is the Railway Bureau's property. Twenty years ago, it was leased to the gentry and merchant Yu Qiaqing for the construction of buildings. At that time, a contract was signed for a lease term of 30 years. Upon expiration, all surface buildings would be returned to the Railway Bureau at no cost. If the Railway Bureau needed to recover the land for its own use after 20 years, it could recover the surface buildings at an assessed value. By the end of this year, the 20-year term has expired, and the Railway Bureau needs to recover the land to build its own building. Therefore, it has contacted Yu, who demanded 400,000 yuan in compensation. The Bureau believes the asking price is too high, so it is negotiating. However, the Bureau's plan to recover the land for construction will not change.</p>

<p>Thirteen young workers from the Shuzi workshop of the Japanese-owned Dongya Ramie Company at 202 Robert Road in West Shanghai went missing after being lured away from work at 6:00 PM on the 12th. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that Wang Dasui, the district chief of the Sixth District of West Shanghai, paid close attention to this matter after receiving the report. He immediately ordered Inspector Gu Wentao and detective squad leader Wu Kezhong to investigate the case thoroughly. After Inspector Gu and squad leader Wu began their investigation, they received a clue yesterday morning that Wang, the foreman of the fine cloth room of the factory, Chen, the foreman of the fine yarn room, and Chen, an unemployed worker, were the instigators. The batch of workers was found hidden in a shed next to the small Land Temple on Binlang Road. They immediately led detective Wang Yixin, Li Changfa, and a large number of police officers to the address. At the entrance of Binlang Road, they encountered three workers, Wang Shoushan, Li Henggui, and Ma Guiwu, who were fleeing from the shed. They brought the three workers with them and entered the shed, rescuing five people, Wang Xiaosanzi, Guo Zhaohong, Li Mazhen, Zhang Buchao, and Zhang Guifa, for a total of eight people, and brought them back to the Sixth District. According to Wang Shoushan and others, Wang Xiaosizi and Qin Da, workers from the same factory, told us on the 11th that they wanted to disrupt the factory. On the afternoon of the 12th, Wang was waiting at the door and led us to the Dahu Sports Building in Caojiadu for dinner. Later, they went to the Yong'an Hotel in the Shankou Factory New Bridge and booked room 13, and also booked a room at the Jinbu Hotel. On the morning of the 13th, they moved to rooms 14 and 49 of the West Shanghai Hotel on Kade Road. On the morning of the 14th, they led us to this shed (Qin Da's home). They said that the factory must hand over</p>
<h3 id="e165">Record of the Trial of Two Escaped Convicts <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>The Two Convicts Claimed to Have Been Abused and Beaten After the Escape</p>
<p>After Speaking, They Took Off Their Clothes to Show Scars, Crying Bitterly</p>
<p>Guard Fu Maoshun's Residence is Restricted, Temporarily Staying in Prison</p>
<p>The Second Special District Prison on Masnan Road in the French Concession had an incident on the morning of the 9th of this month at around 3:00 AM. When the inmates of each cell were opened, nine-four-zero, a serious criminal, Zhang Weicai, nine-nine-two, Zhao Yunzu, and Liu Agui, a petty thief, attempted to escape. Zhang and Zhao forced Liu to climb the wall with a rope to escape, but Liu panicked and fell halfway down, injuring the back of his head. He was sent to Guangci Hospital, but died the following evening due to the severity of his injuries. The warden ordered Zhang and Zhao to be fitted with heavy shackles and await investigation and prosecution. This has been reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that the rope used by the convicts to escape was made by tearing strips from their clothes and trousers. The warden, Sun Xiong, has prepared a document to transfer the two convicts, Zhang and Zhao, and the witness, thief Xia Ajin, as well as the evidence, rope, torn cloth strips, and two long bench boards, to the Procuratorate of the Second Special Court for investigation and prosecution. At 10:00 AM yesterday, Prosecutor Wang Ren and Clerk Zhao Yifen specially opened the Sixth Tribunal for investigation and ordered the two convicts and Xia to be brought in for interrogation. The prison also sent the guards who discovered the incident at the time, Xiao Wenyin, Nie Zhenchun, and Fu Maoshun, to the court as witnesses. According to Zhang and Zhao, they admitted that they colluded with the deceased Liu Agui to escape. It started with jokes, and they first made ropes from their clothes, trousers, and socks, and then secretly filed off their shackles. When they saw Liu fall and get injured, they were afraid to escape. The official summoned the witness Xia Ajin, who testified, "That day, I saw Zhang and Zhao walking out of the room, and I immediately reported to the guard Fu Maoshun, but Fu did not care. Later, the second time I saw a dark shadow on the wall, I went to report to Fu, but Fu still ignored me." According to the guards Xiao Wenyin, Nie Zhenchun, and Fu Maoshun, they testified about the circumstances of the discovery at the time. However, Fu testified that Xia did not report any incident to him beforehand. By this point, it was noon. The official ordered Zhang and Zhao and Xia Ajin to be sent back to prison for custody, and Xiao and Nie were ordered to return. Fu Maoshun's residence was restricted, and he was temporarily detained in prison, not allowed to leave. After the announcement, Zhang claimed that he had confidential information to report to the court and requested that the guards in the court be dismissed. The official granted the request and ordered the guards to withdraw. Zhang claimed that because they failed to escape, they were fitted with heavy shackles, handcuffed, and beaten by guards and officials, including one named Huang Baochang, who pinned me to the ground and beat me with fists and feet, causing serious injuries. I shouted for help, and the inmates in the prison responded. I was dragged outside and beaten, with 30 blows every hour, for a total of three days and nights, lasting 53 hours. After Liu Agui fell and got injured, not only was he not sent to the hospital for treatment, but he was also tied up and beaten in the same way, which led to his death. Zhao Yunzu's testimony was the same as Zhang's. The two convicts were tearful when they spoke and took off their clothes to request an examination of the scars and asked for permission to accuse them of assault. They also expressed their unwillingness to return to prison, fearing further torture. The official ordered the bailiffs to send the two convicts to the forensic doctor for examination. At the same time, he summoned Xiao, Nie, and Fu, the three guards, who all claimed to be unaware of the beatings. The court then adjourned the hearing and announced that it would be reconvened at a later date for further verification.</p>
<p>5,000 yuan to redeem us. Now, we think that such extortion should be a crime, so we escaped." After District Chief Wang received the confession, he ordered the original detectives to arrest Wang Xiaosizi. Qin Da, Wang Chengji, Zhou Jiahe, and Huang Baofu are still being closely investigated.</p>

<p>The Main Culprit, Li Yunchang, Was Arrested in Yunnan for Manufacturing Counterfeit Money</p>
<p>After Being Released on Amnesty, He Sneaked into Shanghai and Dared to Resume His Old Business</p>
<p>According to the Shenshi News Agency's local report, the Special Agency Inspector of the French Concession Police Department, Jin Jiulin, and others seized a large number of counterfeit Fudian New Bank banknotes at the intersection of Baylor Road and Father Lao Road the night before and arrested the manufacturers Li Yunchang, Liu Guangsheng, Ji Jinquan, and others and escorted them to the police station. This morning, they were transferred to the Second Special Court for trial. The police department is still investigating. The Shenshi News Agency reporter interviewed Dong Sixun, the business director of Fudian New Bank, about this matter yesterday. He agreed to an interview and stated that the bank was very angry about this incident. The main culprit in the counterfeiting, Li Yunchang, had repeatedly manufactured counterfeit money in Yunnan and was arrested and imprisoned by the police authorities. After being released on amnesty, he sneaked into Shanghai and resumed his old tricks, manufacturing counterfeit money. Fortunately, he was caught, which shows that justice will always prevail. Dong also said that the bank does not issue banknotes, and the counterfeit money is mostly subsidiary coins, which have little impact on the bank. However, the culprit dared to profit by impersonation, endangering the public, which is hateful. The bank will send a letter to the Second Special Court through its agent lawyer, requesting severe punishment.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Investigates the Yadong Night Market Agency <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Discovers Many Gold and Silver Goods Trading Markets</p>
<p>Reports to the Social Affairs Bureau to Be Submitted to the Ministry of Industry for Approval</p>
<p>The Yadong Gold and Silver Goods Night Market Agency at 989 Avenue Joffre, Shanghai, was founded by the American V. M. Haimoriech and began operations on May 7th of this year. It buys and sells gold bars, cotton, wheat, rubber, silver, and other goods for customers at the exchange and charges commissions. Because it violated Articles 10, Paragraph 1, and 16 of the Exchange Law, the Ministry of Industry instructed the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau to ban it, ordering it to remove all signs and advertisements in front of the store by September 10th of this year. Later, because the agency moved to another location without a fixed address, the instructions could not be delivered. The Social Affairs Bureau ordered the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to inquire and forward the instructions and assigned staff to investigate whether it had been complied with every night before September 10th and report back for verification. This has been reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent staff members Dong Wenzhong and Xue Jianxin to investigate various exchanges. They have completed their investigation and prepared a report, which has been approved by the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and reported to the Social Affairs Bureau to be submitted to the Ministry of Industry for approval. According to the findings obtained by the Xinsheng News Agency, they are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e168">Cessation of Operations <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>The Yadong Gold and Silver Goods Night Market Agency V. M. Haimoriech Co. on Avenue Joffre has indeed ceased operations. It ceased operations and moved to another location in July. The signs and advertisements in front of the store have also been removed. The owner of the agency, Haimoriech, is currently working as a jockey for the Chinese Ma Xiangsheng and also works part-time in the bidding business at the China Exchange Company on Central Road.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Other Discoveries <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>However, according to the investigation results, many gold and silver goods trading markets similar to exchanges have been established in this city. There are China and Central Exchange Companies on Central Road. At 55 Haining Road, there is the Shanghai Bidding Company. Customers only need to pay a deposit of 10 yuan per lot to trade, and one or two lots can also be traded, providing customers with the convenience of small investments. At 15 Xinkang Road, there is a night market bidding trading market with the English words "Asiatic Gold Stock Exchange" written on the glass window and the Chinese sign "Baodayong Gold Store" written next to the wall at the entrance.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Organizational Situation <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The night market is jointly operated by seven Chinese and foreign merchants. Among the shareholders, there are former employees of the Yadong Night Market Agency. It is said that Ma Weiqu has no involvement. The staff is small, but the internal layout is clean and tidy, with price boards for gold, silver, and other goods. Baodayong Gold Store was founded by Mr. Xu, a broker No. 23 of the Shanghai Securities and Goods Exchange, and is the manager of the market.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Business Nature <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>The business hours are set from 10:00 PM to 1:00 AM every night. Since operations began on August 6th, 30 to 40 lots of bidding transactions have been concluded every night. Its business is to buy and sell bidding gold, silver, cotton, wheat, rubber, and other goods for customers at the exchange with brokers or members of the Yadong Night Gold Industry Exchange for the purpose of differential trading and charge high commissions. A goods and gold and silver trading market has been established, translated as "Asian Gold Industry Exchange." However, it is not possible to determine whether it is a disguised organization of the Yadong Night Market Agency or whether it is still managed by Haimoriech. The staff of the market is tight-lipped about the investigators, so it is not possible to obtain accurate evidence of the Yadong Night Market Agency, and the instructions cannot be delivered.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Violation of Laws <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>In summary, the above-mentioned trading markets actually violate Article 2 of the Exchange Law, "An exchange for the trading of securities or similar goods. Only one may be established in each area," Article 16, "No one may operate as an agent, introducer, or transmitter of exchange trading commissions, except for brokers or members who have been approved," and Article 40, "No one may establish a market similar to an exchange outside of the exchange for the purpose of differential trading and conduct trading." How should these be dealt with? A report has been submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for review.</p>

<p>Talks About Helping Jiangxi's Declining Porcelain Industry</p>
<p>According to the Shenshi News Agency, Zhang Gongquan, General Manager of the Bank of China, went to North China to inspect the economic and financial situation and then went down the Yangtze River to Jiangxi to visit Chiang Kai-shek and inspect the current situation of the porcelain industry in Jiangxi Province. Zhang has now transferred from Xun to Beijing and returned to Shanghai by train. The Shenshi News Agency reporter paid a special visit yesterday to inquire about everything. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e174">Inspection of the Economy of North China <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Gongquan set off from Shanghai by ship last month to understand the financial situation in various places and went to North China, Tianjin, and other places for inspection. He held talks with leaders of the financial and business circles in various places and made detailed observations on the economic decline and other realities. Then, he took a train south from Tianjin and went to Jiangxi after arriving in Beijing, inspecting the commercial and production situation in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River along the way. He also went to Lu Mountain at Chiang's invitation to discuss important issues such as the current financial and economic situation with Finance Minister Kong and others. During his stay in Jiangxi, he also inspected the province's porcelain industry and the rural economy. He has now finished his work and returned to Shanghai. According to Zhang, the impressions he gained from this inspection were very good.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Decline of Jiangxi's Porcelain Industry <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Zhang told the Shenshi News Agency reporter yesterday about his inspection of the porcelain industry in Jiangxi: "I paid attention to the porcelain industry in Jiangxi during my trip. Due to various reasons, the porcelain industry in the province has recently entered a state of extreme decline. The main reason is that the makers of porcelain blanks, the kiln operators, and the suppliers of raw materials do not cooperate with each other, which has created the main internal factor of its decline. In places such as Jingdezhen and other famous porcelain producing areas, the makers of blanks are mostly small businesses with capital of no more than two or three hundred yuan. They have not received porcelain industry education, have no artistic knowledge, and have not studied market needs. They also do not know how to use scientific methods. The kiln operators have also been affected by the pressure of foreign goods on the porcelain industry in recent years, which has led to a decline in business. The customers who entrust them to fire porcelain are decreasing, so they have to be held hostage by those who entrust them to fire. They only open the kiln when it is full, so the makers of porcelain blanks have to wait for a long time before they can get their goods, and they cannot meet the needs of the market quickly.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Increased Production Costs <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Furthermore, the kiln owners only know how to reduce fuel and try to increase the height of the kiln as much as possible in order to collect more porcelain blanks and make more profit. As a result, the fired porcelain blanks are easily damaged and of poor quality. The kiln owners not only do not compensate for the damage but also do not refund the firing fee to those who entrusted them to fire the porcelain blanks. On average, 40 pieces of goods must be prepared for every 100 pieces to compensate for damage. As a result, the cost increases, and the price of the goods naturally increases. It is impossible to compete with scientific and low-priced foreign porcelain products, and they are gradually eliminated.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Bad Atmosphere Among Workers <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Jiangxi Province is a region that produces porcelain raw materials. Most of the production in the region is controlled by local tyrants, who try to raise the value as much as possible. Therefore, porcelain blank makers cannot obtain raw materials at favorable prices to reduce the value of their goods. In addition, porcelain workers in Jiangxi Province lack discipline and training and are mostly wandering and unrestrained. The atmosphere is very bad, and work efficiency is also declining. The future of the entire Chinese porcelain industry is in crisis.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Future Improvement Measures <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>In order to improve the porcelain industry in Jiangxi, it is first necessary to have good local officials who thoroughly rectify the local atmosphere, correct the bad habits of the porcelain workers, and increase their productivity. At the same time, it is necessary to seek immediate solutions to the raw material prices and the control of kiln owners. In the active aspect, it is necessary to have specialized knowledge to train a new class of porcelain industry workers, improve the skills of kiln owners, and strive to promote reform. Only then can there be hope for the future. The Jiangxi Provincial authorities have hired Mr. Du Chongyuan to organize the Jiujiang Porcelain Industry Company. The Provincial Government has promised to allocate 200,000 yuan to promote it. Commercial shares will be given residual interest by the government. The improvement and relief of the porcelain industry in Jingdezhen has also been taken over by the National Economic Commission, which is responsible for allocating funds to help its development, so as to seek the revival of China's porcelain industry.</p>

<p>The Desvai Road Police Station suddenly received a notice from the Japanese Consulate at 4:30 PM yesterday, dispatching police to a Japanese residence at 59 Doulean Road at the end of North Sichuan Road, which was a red pill manufacturing facility. The police chief immediately ordered Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the scene to surround and arrest them. Upon reaching the destination, the Japanese at the address had fled upon hearing the news, leaving no trace. Only two or three Chinese were arrested, and several red pills and red pill manufacturing tools were seized and taken to the police station for investigation by the court. When the detectives arrived at the scene, a Ningbo man named Hong Xiuqing, 23 years old, was eager to escape and jumped from the third floor, breaking his back and losing consciousness. He was later spotted by the police and sent to Tongren Hospital in a car, then transferred to the police hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>Suicide Note States Cause as Economic Pressure</p>
<p>At a certain hotel at No. 200 Shansi Road, a man and a woman, each a traveler, arrived around 5:00 PM the night before and requested lodging. The hotel clerk led them to Room 520 on the fifth floor. The man was wearing a bluish-gray woolen single-layer shirt, and the woman wore a white cotton shirt and trousers. They paid the room fee of five yuan and signed the registration book as Zhao Jiaji, a local, 29 years old; the woman was his wife, 25 years old. As usual, the tea server brought tea and water and then left. Later in the evening, the man ordered two servings of coffee and chicken rice from the tea server to eat with the woman. After finishing their meal, they closed the door and went to sleep. However, at about 5:00 AM the next morning, the tea server suddenly heard the sound of a broken bowl coming from the room, followed by groans. Feeling suspicious, they quickly opened the door and entered, finding the man collapsed on a sofa chair and the woman lying across the bed. Both were pale and unconscious. On the table was an empty bottle of medicine. They urgently reported to the clerk, who in turn reported to the police station. The two were transported by car to Renji Hospital for treatment. The hospital examination revealed that they had both taken Lysol poison. Despite various attempts to resuscitate them, they ultimately succumbed to the poisoning and died around 5:30 AM. The police station was notified to send the corpses to the mortuary for examination. A suicide note and several business cards were found on their person, printed with "Zhang Jiaju, style Yimin, Shanghai Dacheng Coal Company, 76 Dapu Bridge, French Concession, telephone 75685 ext." Detectives immediately went to inquire at that address. It was reported that Zhang Jiaju, from Shaoxing, had indeed worked as a salesman for the coal company but had since left. As to whether the woman was Zhang's wife, they claimed not to know. The suicide note stated that they were suffering from economic pressure, but it was vague on details. The police station is still investigating the matter.</p>

<p>Clothes and Pants Not Completely Wet</p>
<p>Appears to be Body Moved After Death</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around 5:00 AM, at the intersection of Great Western Road and Difeng Road in western Shanghai, Officer No. 2660 of the Jing'an Temple police station discovered the body of a man who had been strangled. The man was about 30 years old, of medium build, wearing a black cloth short shirt, white cloth trousers, black thread socks, a monk's haircut, and one shoe. His body was lying on the south side of the road. The police station was notified, and Detective Qian Xianting was ordered to investigate. He saw two ropes around the man's neck, one a brown rope and the other resembling a woman's belt. When the detectives arrived, it was still raining, but the man's clothes and pants were not completely wet. Therefore, it was suspected that the strangling occurred elsewhere and the body was moved to this location. The body was immediately sent to the Red Cross Hospital, but resuscitation efforts failed, and he died. The body was then transferred to the Filon Road mortuary. Around 10:00 AM, Tang, a prosecutor from the First Special Court, accompanied by forensic doctor Zhang Yan, clerk Wang Zuyi, and others, arrived at the morgue to examine the body. After the detectives reported the results of their investigation, Prosecutor Tang declared that the unidentified man had indeed been strangled to death. While the police station investigates the perpetrator, the body was handed over to the Pushan Villa for burial.</p>

<p>Answering Mr. Yuan Qingyan</p>
<p>This is a very common phenomenon. We deeply sympathize with Mr. Yuan and other friends in the same situation. This "boredom" is of the times and is unavoidable for every modern youth. Even if you don't read any books, you will naturally feel it sooner or later in the hardships of life. Mr. Yuan's boredom seems to prove the saying that the more knowledge one has, the more pain one experiences is correct. In fact, ignorance is truly painful, and true pain is unavoidable. Knowing the root of the pain, we should find ways to overcome this root; there is really no need to fear it or be bored by it. What use is boredom? Therefore, Mr. Yuan's boredom has little to do with whether he reads or not.</p>
<p>Although we sympathize with the root of Mr. Yuan's boredom, we dare not agree with Mr. Yuan's attitude, and we must point out that Mr. Yuan's attitude seems a bit like escaping reality. Because this is indeed a common mistake that young people currently make, we must openly discuss it with everyone, hoping that those who have made the same mistake will quickly correct themselves.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, young people tend to be somewhat emotional and cannot see the ugliness of society. Because of his simple mind, earnest attitude, lack of life experience, and eagerness for quick results, he is often easily angry and easily disappointed; he only has enthusiasm and no patience. For everything, he is always too enthusiastic at first, hoping for too much, only wanting smooth sailing and immediate success.</p>
<p>At the same time, he overestimates his own strength and does not see objective reality. Thus, all hopes and all attempts become fantasies suspended in the air, impractical. Naturally, he will inevitably run into obstacles and bad luck everywhere. When the obstacles are too severe and the bad luck is too great, he cannot help but retreat hastily, making him feel disheartened and listless. Those with weak wills may either go along with the ugliness or indulge in sex, love, or some kind of enjoyment, daring not open their eyes to see the world again. Those who are unwilling to degenerate but cannot coordinate with practice will naturally fall into extreme contradictory pain. His mind is constantly struggling and agonizing because it is separated from practice. His thoughts only develop in fantasy, becoming more and more isolated from reality, turning into someone who only knows how to talk big, act crazy, and cannot get along with the people around him. He feels no taste in life, does not like to work, does not want to work, and even feels that there is no one in the world who can talk to him, no one who can work with him. He develops hatred and suspicion towards everyone, rejects all friendship, and drives himself into loneliness day by day, shrinking his living space day by day, shrinking into a dead end. As a result, everyone is afraid of you when they see you, calling you crazy. After reaching this point, if you do not suddenly realize the consequences, you may go mad, insane, or commit suicide. If you reflect on your past enthusiasm for society, isn't it completely opposite now? If you ask yourself, you have been angry your whole life, even sacrificed your own life, what benefit has it brought to society? I think the answer must be heartbreaking. Now, how can we say benefit? We can only say that in some ways, we have helped the ugliness of society.</p>
<p>Here, Mr. Yuan, don't be offended, because this reply is not for Mr. Yuan alone. Mr. Yuan's condition is not as deep as described above. As long as Mr. Yuan turns around and corrects himself, Mr. Yuan still has a very optimistic future. Now, let's get back to the main topic and talk about Mr. Yuan's attitude towards occupation!

<h3 id="e199">Triangular Inter-Port Swimming Closes: Tianjin Overwhelms Hong Kong to Win Championship <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Scores: Tianjin 38, Hong Kong 34, Shanghai 27</p>
<p>Water Polo Final: Hong Kong Wins Over Shanghai 5-1</p>
<p>Last night was the final night of the Shanghai-Tianjin-Hong Kong triangular inter-port swimming competition. It was raining heavily, and the roads were flooded with several inches of water. However, more than a thousand spectators still went to the French Club, with Chinese accounting for only 1%. Mr. and Mrs. Wang Zhengting and Mr. and Mrs. Shen Silang were also present. Inspiring music was broadcast over the radio, just like the heavy rain, encouraging the athletes of the three ports to make their final efforts and compete for the championship.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Situation of Championship <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>In the previous two nights, Hong Kong had the advantage. Last night, at the beginning, in the first event, the 50-yard freestyle, Tianjin's Niniweiji took first place, and Puluodeng took third, adding 6 points. Shanghai's Haimengte was second, and Hong Kong failed to place. Tianjin then surpassed Hong Kong with a score of 27 to 24. In the second event, the 100-yard backstroke, Hong Kong's Liu Xiven lost to Tianjin's Woerwen, losing another 2 points. The score was 32 to 27. In the third event, diving, Shanghai took first and second place, Tianjin third, and Hong Kong was completely defeated again. The outcome depended on the 440-yard freestyle. Because Hong Kong was sure to win the water polo against Shanghai, gaining 3 points, the score would be 30 to 33, with Tianjin winning. If Hong Kong could get first and third place in the 440-yard freestyle, and Tianjin only got second, then each would get 36 points, tying for the championship. Therefore, a fierce battle ensued in this race. Lawrence and Nuomen competed most fiercely. In the end, Lawrence narrowly lost to Tianjin's Nuomen by half a body length. Luochaipiliela took third place. Hong Kong got 4 points, Tianjin 5 points. The total score was 38 to 34, and Tianjin won the championship. In the water polo result, Shanghai lost to Hong Kong 1 to 5. There were many fouls on both sides. Hong Kong's Lawrence was sent off twice, and Shanghai's Sinclair was also sent off once. Hong Kong's passing and shooting were excellent. Goalkeeper Chen Xipei's true skills were not seen because there were no dangerous shots. Shanghai's Bolattlei, originally a famous football player, was more skilled than Zhou Xianyan and saved many dangerous shots, worthy of the name "Iron Gate on Land and Water." Hong Kong's left defender, Fulage, could attack and defend, and was the fatal wound for the Shanghai team. The scores of the three teams are as follows:</p>

<p>Last night, in addition to the inter-port competition program and the local men's and women's powerlifting competition, there were also two comical performances. One was a 60-yard obstacle swim, first passing through bamboo poles, then through lifebuoys, then climbing a suspended moving rope ladder, and crossing a large wooden stake across the pool, and then passing through a lifebuoy and over the bamboo poles to reach the finish line. Among them, climbing the rope ladder and crossing the wooden stake was the most difficult. Three people failed to pass and gave up. The other scene was a costumed comical fight. Five people appeared, looking like clowns in a circus. Two people in a group rode on a large wooden stake across the pool, each holding a handle of a cloth-wrapped water polo, fighting each other. The first to fall into the water lost. As a result of the elimination, Pan Nigel, dressed as a woman, won, causing laughter and applause. The complete results of the inter-port competition are recorded below:</p>

The enrollment examination has been completed, and classes are scheduled to begin on September 25th. The agricultural and forestry specialty courses have not been planned for this term due to funding and school building constraints, and will be planned later.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Central Government to Approve Confucius Memorial Song <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>This year, for Confucius's birthday, the Central Government, in order to carefully prepare a Confucius Memorial Song, ordered the Ministry of Education through the Executive Yuan to notify all levels of schools across the country that before a suitable lyric is prepared, the Confucius Memorial Song will be temporarily absent during the memorial ceremony. Later, the Executive Yuan ordered the Ministry of Education to prepare this memorial song so that it could be used during the Confucius memorial ceremony. Yesterday, the Executive Yuan, according to the Ministry of Education's presentation, proposed to use the passage "When the Great Way prevails, it will lead to Datong" from the Book of Rites, "The Great Learning," as the Confucius Memorial Song. The reason is that this passage is very in line with modern social thought and coincides with the purpose of the Three Principles of the People. The score already made by the National Conservatory of Music was also attached. It is said that the Central Government is reviewing this case and will soon issue an order for its adoption.</p>
<h3 id="e224">This City Convenes Meeting of Secondary School Deans of Students and Civics Teachers <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>Held yesterday at Wuben Girls' High School with over eighty schools represented</p>
<p>Commissioner Tao and Director Pan provided guidance on student guidance policies</p>
<p>The City Party Headquarters and the Municipal Bureau of Education convened a discussion meeting yesterday at 2:00 PM in the auditorium of Wuben Girls' High School. Deans of students and civics teachers from public and private secondary schools citywide were invited. Commissioner Tao of the City Party Headquarters and Director Pan of the Municipal Bureau of Education provided guidance on student guidance policies. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees: In addition to Tao Baichuan, Standing Committee Member of the City Party Headquarters, Yu Zhongbiao, Director of the Party Affairs Education Division, Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Education, and Chen Bai, Section Chief, attendees included over one hundred deans of students and civics teachers from over eighty schools, including Wuben, Jingye, Yangjing, Wusong, Nanshang, Junyi, Minli, Binhai, Minguang, Peiming, Aiqun, Aiguo, Xinlu, Chengzhong, Guangxia, Jinan, Shibei, Xinya, Zhengyi, Huadong, Shangzhong, Pudong, Daozhong, and Cihang, such as Zhu Ya Kui, Wang Longzhang, Xu Xingchu, Xu Zexiang, Zhou Shifu, Li Chongpu, Zhang Yongchun, Jin Yuezhang, Huang Daping, Chen Guangyu, and Wang Xuequan.</p>
<p>Chairman’s Report: Chairman Tao Baichuan first gave a report, stating that the mission of Party Affairs teachers and student guidance directors is very important and closely related to the Party Headquarters. Generally, not all teachers are Party members, but deans of students and civics teachers are all comrades of our Party. In the past, the Party Headquarters had not convened meetings with these comrades, leading to a lack of mutual connection. This is a deficiency. In the future, we want deans of students and Party Affairs teachers to develop a relationship with the Party Headquarters and the Bureau of Education. Therefore, we will regularly convene meetings for mutual discussion and exchange of ideas. The mission undertaken by everyone for secondary education in Shanghai is very important, especially in today's China. The responsibility of guiding middle school students is even more significant. Regarding the training of students, I think we can utilize the organization of student self-governance associations. However, the student movements of today are different from those of the May Fourth era. In the past, mass movements naturally included student movements, often leading the masses to abandon their professions. This was a major problem. Future student movements must absolutely not be like this. The organization of student self-governance associations must be based on the Three Principles of the People to train students in self-governed life within the school and to promote their intellectual, moral, physical, and communal development. Deans of students can utilize the organization of student self-governance associations to train students. At the same time, I hope everyone will first understand their own responsibilities, second, enrich their knowledge for the work they should possess, and cultivate their personality, so that they can perform their work competently and happily.</p>
<p>Director’s Speech: Director Pan then gave a speech, stating: (1) There should be a common trend in student guidance policies for secondary schools in Shanghai. Whether one is strict or lenient with students, education is not a private enterprise of one or two people. Therefore, although schools are divided into public and private, the work done by schools is the same. They are all engaged in educational work that is closely related to the nation and the people. Any school's dean of students and civics teacher is running on the same road in their management of students. Of course, when divided into stages within the educational system, elementary school, middle school, and university have different student guidance methods due to the age limits of the students being educated. However, secondary schools in the same stage must have a common trend. Otherwise, the level of strictness will vary greatly from school to school, with a great impact. The standard of whether it should be lenient or strict should be sought from comrades who are actually training students. (2) So, what should our trend ultimately be? In my personal opinion, any policy or trend cannot ignore the current environment of the country. After all, nothing can escape time and space. Therefore, to determine the student guidance trend for the secondary school stage, we cannot erase the current environment of China. The China of today is like a house surrounded by fire. Everyone inside is in danger of being burned to death. Now is not the time for us to jump into the fire pit; we are already in the fire pit. We should find a way to escape the fire pit. Education is the most fundamental method of national salvation among many methods of national salvation. Hu Shi once said that everyone says education is bankrupt, but to save a bankrupt country, we still rely on education. Therefore, people in the education field should take more responsibility. In the context of time and space for secondary education, we cannot allow students to be permissive and free. Student movements have been a good term since the May Fourth Movement, but since the two major blows of the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident, it has become clear that our students lack perseverance and only have impulsiveness. This cannot save the country. Now, students with calmer minds have realized this. This is the beginning of a turning point. At this moment, talking about student movements obviously cannot be like it was during the May Fourth Movement. Previously, it was destructive work; now we want to build. Therefore, we can no longer be permissive with middle school students. However, only the dean of students can train schools to conduct student movements in middle schools. Only civics teachers can assist the dean of students in doing so. All student actions, speech, and thoughts must be guided by the dean of students and civics teachers. Deans of students and civics teachers are entrusted by the Party and the government to take on this important responsibility. I hope everyone understands this point and trains students to become individuals who can save themselves in the future. (3) Now, if we analyze the responsibilities for the student unrest in many schools, one-third is the responsibility of the students, one-third is the responsibility of some teachers and staff who incite the unrest, and another one-third should be the responsibility of all teachers and staff from the principal down. If every teacher and staff member in the school, from the principal down, does not neglect their duties, then the students will have no loopholes to exploit. It will be easier for the dean of students and civics teachers to train students. Otherwise, if the school itself is not sound in all aspects and the teachers and staff do not fulfill their duties, then the dean of students and civics teachers will not be able to train students. However, even if everyone encounters this difficult environment, they should still work hard. However, you must obtain the principal's understanding. The principal must also take responsibility for student guidance. Finally, one more point is very important. The dean of students and civics teachers are not nominal positions and cannot hold concurrent jobs. They must actually go to the school to take responsibility. The prevalent symptom now is that most deans of students and civics teachers have taken on the title but do not take responsibility. This will cause the student management of secondary schools in Shanghai to be entirely ruined by the deans of students and civics teachers. In the future, the Bureau of Education will send personnel to each school at any time to investigate. If they encounter this kind of irresponsible dean of students or civics teacher, they will definitely not be allowed to hold the position. For the sake of secondary schools and secondary education in Shanghai, we must rescue those who are specially responsible and have them take responsibility.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Municipal Bureau of Education Sends Personnel to Investigate the Situation of Science Teachers in Primary and Secondary Schools <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>Departure set for the 17th, completion of investigation within one week</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Education previously received an order from the Ministry of Education to organize a summer workshop for science teachers in secondary schools in this city to provide science teachers in various secondary schools in this city with opportunities for professional development, improve the efficiency of science teaching in various schools, and improve students' science proficiency. It also aimed to remedy the drawbacks of middle school students in this city performing poorly in science subjects in past national examinations. However, after investigation, only over 120 science teachers in various secondary schools in this city have received this training. There are still a significant number of people who have not received training due to various reasons, and there is inevitably a distinction between good and bad. Furthermore, the hiring of science teachers in various schools is often done hastily and with unqualified people filling positions, which has a significant impact on students' science proficiency. Therefore, the Bureau attaches importance to science facilities in secondary schools and has decided to investigate the situation of science teachers in secondary schools in this semester in order to make distinctions. It is heard that the Bureau has already assigned Shen E, Du Xi, Xu Guiji, Sheng Youxuan, Shen Wuguang, Lu Hanqiu, Chen Yu and other seven people to depart tomorrow (the 17th) to go to various schools to conduct on-site investigations, which are expected to be completed within one week.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Vocational Education Society’s Vocational Guidance Center Issues Letter to School Youths Yesterday <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>Willing to provide guidance and service to young people when difficulties arise in selecting subjects and seeking education</p>
<p>The Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center of the China Vocational Education Society, considering that when schools in this city and other regions recently started classes, and when new students or students already enrolled selected subjects and sought education, they often encountered difficulties that needed to be resolved but had no place to ask for advice, since the center has the responsibility of guiding young people, it is willing to provide services to young people. Yesterday, it issued a letter to school youths, the original text of which is as follows: Time flies, another academic year has passed. My respectable and lovable young students, you are once again burying yourselves in your studies and living your school lives. Some of you are continuing your previous work, carrying on past achievements, while others have just completed one stage and are entering a new school. We witness the panic of the times and are alarmed by the difficulties of finding a way out. Learning from past mistakes, we are even more apprehensive. Instead of panicking when things happen, why not fix things before they occur? Considering that young people in various schools may feel doubts and discomfort at the beginning of this academic year, they may feel that the subjects they have chosen do not match their personality, or that the courses they are currently taking do not arouse their interest, or they may doubt whether the subject they have chosen is suitable for their needs, or they may fear that their personal financial resources will not be enough to complete their studies, or they may have entered school rashly due to temporary emotions and seem to regret it, or they may want to learn widely because of the encouragement of friends, but are hesitant. In addition, individual health may have shortcomings, and family affairs may need to be resolved. All these concerns will inevitably distract you. If you lack the guidance and solutions, you may not be able to dispel your doubts and feel at ease. Our center has a heart to help and a responsibility to guide. We are not overestimating ourselves and are willing to provide consultations for young people and are happy to discuss with students. We hope that our opinions, even if they are not profound, can prevent you from getting lost. If students in various schools have any doubts or difficulties in the future, they can ask questions in person or by mail, and we will be happy to answer them. If our answers are inappropriate or unsatisfactory, we hope that experts will correct our deficiencies. We would be very pleased.</p>
<h3 id="e227">Wuzhou Pharmacy Offers Preferential Treatment to Schools Purchasing Medications for Tuberculosis <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education yesterday issued an instruction to the elementary schools in this city, stating: According to a letter approved from Wuzhou Pharmacy, "Upon investigation, tuberculosis is widespread globally, and its harm is unmatched. Eastern nations, in particular, have a predisposition to infection. Now that our country is experiencing economic decline and hardship, the spread of infection is even more conceivable. Therefore, various groups in Shanghai have organized tuberculosis prevention associations to popularize common knowledge of prevention and promote early treatment, which is a crucial and urgent measure to save the nation. We recently learned that your bureau, with the assistance of the China Red Cross Children's Section, conducted examinations in elementary schools such as Bide and Xicheng in this city, and the results of the examinations showed that 60-70% of the children had positive reactions. Your bureau has taken measures to provide treatment according to the severity of the cases, demonstrating the educational authorities' utmost concern for the health of students and the nation. Our company operates in new medicines, which is part of the health industry. We should do our best to help within our capabilities. In addition to donating 500 yuan to help the academic community treat tuberculosis, we have specially formulated preferential measures for medications used in treatment, as recorded below. We do not dare to be generous; we are merely fulfilling our duty." A copy of the preferential measures for medications used in the treatment of tuberculosis is attached. Upon approval, it is found that tuberculosis testing and vaccinations in this city have attracted attention from all sectors since they were first carried out last year. This year, we will continue to carry them out. All weak children and children who have been diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis in various schools should immediately contact the children and seek treatment as soon as possible. The medications for the treatment of tuberculosis manufactured by the pharmacy can be handled in accordance with the preferential rules issued by the pharmacy. It is urgent to copy the preferential measures and order the elementary schools to follow them. This order is attached with a copy of the preferential measures for medications used in the treatment of tuberculosis manufactured by Wuzhou Pharmacy. (1) These measures are limited to the purchase of medications for the treatment of tuberculosis by elementary school students in this city. (2) Our company has printed preferential certificates and distributed them to various elementary schools. After verification, they can be used to purchase medications from our company at 4th Malu. (3) Our company's self-made products, such as Globe Brand Malt Extract Cod Liver Oil, Wuzhou Milky White Cod Liver Oil, and Cough Syrup, will all be reduced by half. (4) Doctor's prescriptions will only be charged at cost. (5) Other injection medicines will be provided by our company without additional fees. (6) These measures will be valid for one year, from September 1, 1934 to August 31, 1935. They will be invalid after the expiration date.</p>

<p>Considering that in recent years, young people in this city's education circles tend to focus on the study of classroom textbooks, while remaining ignorant of common sense in daily applications, social situations, international realities, etc., and in order to correct these shortcomings, prominent figures in the education circles feel that there is a need to publish a supplementary reading material for young people. Therefore, Tong Xingyou, Zhao Yuanan, and others have initiated the publication of a Newcomer Weekly, which is specifically for general young people and housewives to read. The content focuses on the inculcation of knowledge, ideological training, and moral cultivation, while striving for the interestingness of writing skills. The authors are all contemporary celebrities and experts, such as Chen Bulei, Pan Gongzhan, Zhou Fohai, Liu Zhanen, Tao Baichuan, Fan Zhongyun, Fu Donghua, Xie Liuyi, Yang Weiyu, Pan Yangyao, Li Gongpu, and other two or thirty people. Preparations are now complete, and it will be published tomorrow to meet the public. The content is rich, and the selections are all famous works. It is heard that the presidents of various universities and middle schools believe that this publication is closely related to guiding young people, and all want to set up distribution points in their respective schools to facilitate young people's purchase and reading. Therefore, in two days, more than 2,000 subscriptions have been arranged with the agency. The book is sold through the Life Bookstore, and subscriptions are handled by the Shanghai Bank Ximen Branch. Details can be found in tomorrow's newspaper.</p>

<h3 id="e230">Financial Chips Gradually Diminishing <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>Gold speculation market is especially mediocre</p>
<p>Popular sentiment is sluggish and continues to fall 2 yuan 9</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was psychologically uneasy, and the situation tended to be weak. However, there were not many transactions in the morning, and neither demand nor supply was enthusiastic. The ups and downs were very erratic. At the beginning of the morning, due to the stability of the overseas silver market in London and the rise in the United States, large dealers were slightly disadvantaged. The price of raw gold in London did not change, resulting in very slight fluctuations in the exchange rate. American cotton fell by 6 pounds, American wheat shrank by 2.75 points, and stocks also fell. The pre-market trading outside the market opened weakly. After opening, the situation was stable. When it was learned that HSBC Bank's listed prices showed a rise of 125 for British currency and 375 for US currency, popular sentiment became weak, and selling pressure was extremely strong. The Central Bank slightly opened cash transactions, but it was difficult to stop the selling pressure. The exchange rate also became stronger. Da Xing Yong and others aggressively supplied shares, almost approaching the 50 yuan mark. After entering the market, the Guang gang's Sheng Da took advantage of the low prices to buy, and the decline stopped. However, due to the lack of special stimulus, there were quite a few people who took the opportunity to buy in. The exchange rate was normal, and popular sentiment also tended to stabilize, and the market gradually pulled up. There was a slight struggle along the way, but the exchange rate was flat, and there was a lack of supply in the market. With the chips being scarce, the sellers felt pressure. After this, it seemed that demand exceeded supply. The morning closing was firm. Under the circumstances that the Ministry of Finance was inclined to crack down on gold speculation, there were rumors from time to time that were unfavorable to the shorts. The slightly higher price after the close was actually due to a small number of scattered shorts covering their positions, but there was a lack of buying and selling in the market, making it easy to raise the price. As the chips gradually decreased, there was no interest among the industry, and the market situation was unusually mediocre. The market situation for the morning is recorded below.</p>
<p>The opening price in the morning was 954 yuan and 2 jiao, which was 1 yuan and 7 jiao lower than the previous closing price. The exchange rate opening price in the morning was 1 shilling, 4 pence, and 9375 for the near-term selling price of British currency, and 35 yuan and 375 for the US currency. Yongli Zhaofeng Chang Yicheng supplied shares, and the price rose to 5 yuan and 3 jiao. Huabi offered half a yuan for US currency in November, and Dingkang Dadecheng Fuan Zhaofeng Chang sold, dropping to 4 yuan and 2 jiao. Shanghai offered 625 for US currency in December, and Dadecheng supplied shares, rising to 5 yuan. When it was learned that HSBC's listed prices showed a rise of 125 for British currency and 375 for US currency, the selling pressure was strong. Qingyu Dekang Shenkang Daxing Yong Dadecheng Dingkang sold to 2 yuan and 8 jiao. Although there was some hovering at this time, popular sentiment was unfavorable, and Daxing Yong Hengyu Zhentai sold aggressively, falling to 05 jiao. Sheng Da Yingfeng Heng took advantage of the low prices to buy, and was able to recover. Yuan Mao Yong Heng Yuyu Qingyong and others also bought in, gradually rising to 2 yuan and 8 jiao. Dadecheng took advantage of the high prices to sell, retreating to 2 yuan and 1 jiao. Hengyu Yuanmao Yong Yiyu and others all had buy orders, and the market gradually rose to 3 yuan and 1 jiao. Chinese merchants sought to close positions, and there were few sellers for US currency in December at 6875. After a struggle, the morning closing price was 953 yuan. After the close, scattered shorts rushed to cover their positions, and the market was raised to more than 4 yuan and a half. There were rumors that were unfavorable to the shorts. The highest price in the morning was 955 yuan and 3 jiao, and the lowest price was 950 yuan and 5 jiao, with a fluctuation of 4 yuan and 8 jiao. As a result, the price fell 2 yuan and 9 jiao compared to the previous closing price.</p>
<p>The closing price was 981 yuan, 5 jiao, and 6 fen due to HSBC Bank's US currency listing price rising by 375 to 35 yuan and 2 jiao, which was in line with the gold speculation price. In terms of the closing price, approximately 28 yuan was pressed, which was less than 8 yuan less than the previous closing price. The registration price for this month was 953 yuan, and the price for October was also 953 yuan. The deferred price was also the same. The morning water replenishment price was 953 yuan, and the price of pure gold was still calculated at an additional 10 yuan, listing at 964 yuan and 2 jiao. The spot market was unable to supply, and the Tianjin gang sold 350 taels to Yingfeng Heng. The spot price was only an additional 11 yuan and a half, and Yingfeng Heng sold 350 taels of futures to the Tianjin gang at an additional 13 yuan and a half. In addition, there was a lack of transactions. The Central Bank opened 4-500 shares, and the price started at 30 yuan and decreased to 1 yuan and a half, which was sold through the spot market numbers Yingfeng Heng and Taikang Run. There were still 763 shares remaining for this month, with a total of 7 long positions and 3 short positions.</p>
<p>The trading in the market was erratic and unstable, and the table appeared dry. In total, Daxing Yong Dingkang Tongchun Dingchang Hengchang Yong Shen Hengyu Dafa Yongfu Yu Dadecheng Fuxing Yong and others were on the selling side. Sheng Da Yongli Yicheng Yuanmao Yong Ding Taixiang Heyong Dekang Shunli Wanxing Yingfeng Heng and others were on the buying side. Zhaofeng Chang advanced first and then retreated, and Qingyong Yuanmao Yong first retreated and then advanced. The Dalian gang Wanxing made a total of more than 500 shares, squeezing in more than 100 shares, and Shunli made a total of more than 200 shares, squeezing in a small number. The Guang gang's Sheng Da approximately bought 400 shares, and Hengxing had few purchases and sales. The total number of transactions on that day was 70,504 shares, and another 47,607 shares.</p>
<p>The number of shares for the November period was 9,814. The buying side included Fuchang with 2,324 shares, Qianchang Xiang Fuxing Yong with more than 1,400 shares each, Dadecheng with more than 1,200 shares, Shunmao with more than 900 shares, Hongxing with more than 500 shares, and Dacheng Yuanheng with more than 300 shares each.

<h3 id="e232">Saturday Silver Dollar Market Quiet <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>Call Loan Rate Remains at 13%</p>
<p>Recently, the silver dollar market has shown an upward trend due to the approaching Mid-Autumn Festival. However, yesterday, being Saturday, most banks were only open for half a day, causing the market to feel slightly quiet. Nevertheless, the premium for silver dollars was wider than usual due to the holiday, so various market prices remained unusually firm. The call loan rate in the market remained at 13%, the same as in the morning and no change from the previous day. The rate for mixed dollars was consistently at 3%, appearing slightly weaker by 1% compared to the previous day. Call loan transactions were also not as active as in previous days. Total morning transactions for transfers and new deals were over 3.5 million, while afternoon transactions were over 300,000. Transactions at the Small General Association were over 500,000. Silver dollar pledge transactions included over 500,000 in redemptions and over 900,000 in new deals. On the receiving side, due to banks only being open for half a day, the volume was significantly less than in previous days. Foreign banks received over 1.6 million in remittances, over 2.6 million in various goods, drafts, pledges, and miscellaneous receipts, and 200,000 in withdrawals from warehouses. Chinese banks received over 1.8 million in remittances, over 400,000 in customs duties, over 3.0 million in various drafts, goods, pledges, and miscellaneous receipts, and 400,000 in withdrawals from warehouses. Japanese banks received over 1.5 million in remittances, over 3.2 million in various drafts, goods, pledges, and miscellaneous receipts, and 300,000 in withdrawals from warehouses. Money shops and public bureaus received over 4,300 in public notes, over 3.1 million in mixed dollars, recovered over 600,000 in banknotes, issued over 800,000, received over 400,000 in remittances from various routes, received 900,000 in cash, had 200,000 in incoming customer funds, and 150,000 in outgoing funds. Furthermore, the total exchange amount at the clearinghouse on the 15th was 11,157,498.17 silver dollars, including 3,693,342.19 silver dollars in cash and 7,881,645.98 silver dollars in drafts.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan small silver coins opened in the morning at 834 yuan, unchanged from the previous day, with 3,000 coins traded. There were no afternoon transactions, so the price remained the same. Guangdong small silver coins fell by 9 cents in the morning, trading at 746.80 yuan, but recovered by 1.20 yuan in the afternoon to 748 yuan, resulting in a net increase of only 3 cents compared to the previous day. Morning transactions amounted to 110,000 coins, and afternoon transactions amounted to 55,000 coins. Copper coins continued to rise by 2,000 cash from the previous day, reaching 323,000 cash, with a transaction value of 12,000 yuan, equivalent to 38,760 strings of cash.</p>

<p>Declines Ranged from 23 Cents to 1.23 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange experienced a sudden reversal. The sharp rise of the previous day was merely due to factors related to margins. The so-called rumors about pledges were not credible, which further proves that current account balances are still above 60 million yuan. Among these, there are still many floating long and short positions. However, some transactions have been offset off the exchange, and there is significantly less interference from squeezes within the exchange. With one week remaining in this month's trading, the outlook still depends on the supply and demand of margins. Even with slight squeezes, major changes are unlikely. Yesterday's trading initially continued the upward momentum from the previous day, rising by 3 to 5 cents. However, it became increasingly weak later on. Starting from the 20th issue, it reversed slightly, but due to heavy selling of the 11th issue, it fell by 45 cents to 75 cents. The sudden reversal showed that the upward momentum lacked staying power, and market sentiment turned soft again. Subsequent sessions saw a general decline of 35 cents to 75 cents. Among these, only the 20th Issue Consolidated Salt Tax and unified salt tax rose by 34 cents, due to offset-trade relations, which was not enough to drive the overall market. In the afternoon sessions, due to Saturday, transactions were cleared, and market prices were weak and lifeless, declining by about 23 cents per session. The future trend will likely be small first and then large, with neither rises nor falls having sustained strength. Overall, it can be considered a consolidation, but in reality, it is an offset trade of long and short positions. The final result of yesterday's market prices was a general decline, ranging from 23 cents to 1.23 yuan. The total transaction volume was 16,250,000 yuan. The results of the rises and falls are listed in the comparison table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>According to a report from the Sin Fung Trading Company, a decline occurred in the New York stock market yesterday (the 14th), with several stocks hitting new lows. United Chemical Color plummeted by $8.50, but the reason has not yet been determined. US Steel preferred stock fell to $71.125, the lowest price this year, down $3.875 from the previous day, as rumors persisted that the directors would vote to cancel the preferred stock dividend at a meeting in October. US government bonds were also soft due to a lack of investors and the absence of support from the Treasury, which affected the bond market. The market at the small exchange also declined. The fall in Chicago wheat was not due to bad news, but rather due to a lack of buyers. The total daily trading volume was 840,000 shares. The Dow Jones index is listed below:</p>

<p>Japanese Merchants Dump Large Quantities</p>
<p>The yarn market is weak, and the decline is intensifying. Due to a lack of buyers this month, and heavy pressure from foreign merchants, bullish investors see the unfavorable environment and have no choice but to cut their losses, causing the market to decline further each month, with new lows being discovered. However, actual yarn sales are still around 1,000 bales.</p>

<p>The opening market for marked yarn was weak, with a uniform decline in the Indian and American cotton markets. The market was firm in the morning, but selling pressure suddenly emerged in the second and third sessions as some bullish investors closed their positions, resulting in a decline of 1.00, 1.20, and 1.30 yuan across all months. In the afternoon, it was said that Japanese merchants were offering several thousand bales of 20-count Blue Phoenix Hongxi yarn, and buyers were selling them on the marked yarn market, worsening the market situation. All months fell by another 56 cents. Total daily transactions were 50,400 bales. Reported sales included 750 bales from Tung Kee, 500 bales from Heng Yih, 550 bales from Sui Lung, 1,950 bales from Dah Kee, 700 bales from Wai Hong, 1,500 bales from Shen Chang, 700 bales from Shen Kee, 650 bales from Yan Fung, 750 bales from Yuan Tai, 2,350 bales from Chang Fung, 2,050 bales from Dah Fung, and 700 bales from Ming Wah.

<p>The cotton market is also weak, with a downward trend in the American and Indian cotton markets and a decline in market sentiment. However, adverse weather conditions and continuous rainfall have somewhat limited selling pressure. The decline in the yarn market makes it even more difficult for the cotton market to stabilize.</p>

<p>The opening market for marked cotton was weak, with heavy rain limiting selling pressure. In the second and third sessions, there were many reports of falling American and Indian cotton markets, and market sentiment was particularly weak. Sellers suddenly rushed in, and all months fell by 15 to 20 cents. In the afternoon, bullish investors closed their positions, and the poor yarn market caused all months to fall by another 15 to 20 cents, with all months hitting new lows. Total daily transactions were 156,700 dan. Reported sales included 5,000 dan from Chang Fung, 3,000 dan from Yuan Yih, 5,600 dan from Yan Fung, 3,600 dan from Yuan Te, 5,000 dan from Dah Foo, 8,000 dan from Dah Fung, 3,800 dan from Jun Chang, 5,900 dan from Tai Chang, 4,800 dan from Yuan Hing Chang, 3,200 dan from Yih Fung, and 1,500 dan from Hap Sang.

<p>Yesterday, American cotton was weak due to selling pressure, sluggish cloth market, and weakness on Wall Street. As a result, spot prices fell by 5 points per pound, and futures fell by 6 to 15 points per pound. British cotton futures fell by 4 points. Indian cotton was initially weak due to bullish investors closing positions and speculative selling, but then recovered due to purchases by exporters from 蘇州(Suzhou)州. As a result, 平果尔(Pingguoer) and 奥姆辣(Aomula) fell by 罗比(Luobi), and 白罗汉(Bailuohan) fell by 2.5 罗比(Luobi). Original telegrams are on the left (dated the 14th):</p>

<h3 id="e244">Future American Cotton Prices <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>Will Fluctuate Between 12 and 15 Cents</p>
<p>A New York telegram on September 14th reported on the cotton market situation for the week, stating that at the beginning of the week, the cotton market reacted after the release of the Department of Agriculture report and the liquidation of long positions, as well as the accumulated short positions from the previous week. However, when the December futures price approached 13 cents, buying interest increased significantly, as this price was close to the government's loan standard for cotton farmers. In the middle of the week, there was first a rally due to short covering and retail purchases, followed by a fall due to poor labor unrest and renewed liquidation by long investors. Yarn mill demand has sharply reduced due to strikes, so futures buyers are maintaining a 12-cent loan to curb the pressure of new cotton entering the market. The new cotton that has already entered the market has been absorbed to fulfill old contracts, but after the price increase, buyers are wary. Those with cotton on hand can obtain a 12-cent loan by pledging their cotton at a price of 15 cents or higher in New Orleans. It is expected that if the 12-cent loan can effectively prevent the cotton price from falling, then the world cotton market will have higher prices, so future transactions will fluctuate between 15 and 12 cents. Cotton trading this week has been quite slow due to textile labor unrest.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market for each month showed a pattern of first falling and then stabilizing. Foreign wheat prices in Chicago fell by around 7-9 cents, and Canadian wheat fell by around 4-5 cents. Market sentiment was weak at the opening, and the current month fell to a low of 2.36 yuan. Distant months also fell by 1-1.5 cents compared to the previous day. However, each mill felt that its margin stakes were already substantial and had no intention of increasing them further. At most, the inland buyers mainly held long positions. Under these circumstances, it was very difficult to exit, so they had to endure, and the market stabilized and rebounded. By the afternoon opening, trading for each month was still quiet, with only minor offset trading by the mills and little activity. As a result, the current month improved by 0.5%, October remained unchanged, October improved by 0.25%, December fell by 0.5%, January fell by 0.5%, and February fell by 0.5%.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Wheat Futures Was Pulled in Opposite Directions <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning, the market for each month was generally quiet. Foreign wheat prices in Chicago fell by a large amount of 7-9 cents, and Canadian wheat fell by around 4-5 cents. At the opening, although the situation was very unfavorable, the bulls did not want to sell cheaply and held firm as usual. New short investors were also unwilling to take risks due to actual inventory, so the market for each mill was not much different from the previous day. By the afternoon opening, the flour market had stabilized and recovered somewhat, and market sentiment had also been boosted. However, at the afternoon opening, the flour market had stabilized and recovered. 60, 瑶灣麦(Yaowan Wheat) was 3.60 yuan, second grade was 0.58 yuan, 宿州麦(Suzhou Wheat) was 3.65 yuan, and 扬州麦(Yangzhou Wheat) was 3.55 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e248">Rice Arrivals Still Consistent <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, there were still more than 20 sources from various groups, totaling 3,450 stones of goods, mostly 厚梗(Hougeng) and 特尖(Tejian), with a small amount of late rice. The market situation continued to be weak. Prices for 苏同(Sutong) and 南港(Nangang) goods fell by about 10 cents. Fortunately, the arrival of late rice was scarce, and 青岛(Qingdao) groups bought over 100 packages, so market sentiment seemed more stable and prices did not fluctuate. New early rice has become stagnant, and new early sharp-tip rice has become weaker due to the heavy supply, continuing to decline by 20 cents. 变元(Bianyuan) goods have been scarce for a long time, and the situation seems fresh.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, there were 21 or 22 sources from various routes downriver. Sales of various goods in the market were lackluster due to continuous autumn rain, and trading was flat. Prices for 白粳(Baijing)新羊尖(Xinyangjian) and 团尖(Tuanjian) still showed a tight trend. Sources of 东西新(Dongxixin) and others were scarce, and prices were also high. The remaining goods did not change much.</p>

<p>Rain Damages Rice, Market Sentiment Rises</p>
<p>Yesterday, the 洋客秈(Yangkexian) rice market was weak due to a large amount of stock and arrivals, but the continuous rain yesterday resembled a typhoon, and the autumn rain damaged the late rice crop, so market sentiment was unanimously optimistic. Coincidentally, the local buyers went to Shanghai to actively purchase 3,555 packages of damaged rice, 1,200 packages of damaged rice, and 100 tons of foreign rice. Because the demand was still strong, the market recovered, and 中关(Zhongguan) goods rose by 10 cents. High-quality goods did not match the demand from that region and remained flat. This local buyer also bought 800 packages of foreign rice and 250 packages of 湘机米(Xiangjimi). Although other groups did not inquire, they also showed a tendency to purchase, so the market might start to increase.</p>
<h3 id="e250">Soybean Sales Slightly Stagnant, Sources Continue to Arrive <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for new and old soybeans remained flat and weak, with little improvement. Currently, new soybean sources are arriving continuously, but sales are scarce, and prices have fallen by 2-3 cents to 6-7 cents. The price of 正阳关(Zhengyangguan) beans in old beans was 3.2 yuan and 18 cents, which was for local demand. Two cars of 颍州(Yingzhou) beans were priced at 2.8 yuan and were purchased from inland areas. 400 packages of 砀山(Dangshan) beans were priced at 2.9 yuan and were also purchased by inland buyers. In new beans, 70 packages of 鄱阳(Poyang) beans were priced at 3.95 yuan, 100 packages of 江桥(Jiangqiao) beans were priced at 3.92 yuan, and 200 packages of 城门(Chengmen) beans were priced at 3.74 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e251">Autumn Rain Continues, Metal Products Market Weaker <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, with the continuous autumn rain, the metal products market was even weaker. Many buyers were suspending purchases due to the inconvenience of shipping, and factories in this street were making some small purchases for practical use. The market was extremely weak, and prices were also loosening. 100 pounds of German tinplate opened at 16 yuan, falling by 10 cents compared to the previous day. 200 pounds of 卫司(Weisi) iron was estimated at 28.45 yuan, falling by 5 cents. 7-foot 東白铁(Dongbaitie) opened at 1.28 yuan, also down by 1 cent. In addition, British steel plates, angle iron, tinplate, and local nails were also mostly weaker. However, with the adverse environment in recent days and market sentiment weak, there were concerns about a decline in the valuation of various goods coming to the market.</p>
<h3 id="e252">Over 500 Tons of British Steel Plates Ordered <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a certain British trading company made an order for 500 tons of 4-foot, 8-foot, 2.5-3mm British steel plates, for shipment from September to December. The price was kept secret by both parties and is unknown.</p>

<p>Another 10 Cents Drop</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a slight improvement due to the shortage of 24 coarse sugar. The guild quoted a spot price of 19.75 yuan, an increase of 10 cents, but no transactions were made. Goods in this shop were 19.8 yuan, up by 5 cents. Transit goods were 6.55 yuan, unchanged. Existing Dutch red sugar was quoted at the original price without success. Transit goods were quoted at 5.2 yuan. The 暗盘(Anpan) was heard to have traded at 10 cents. The local 绵白糖(Mianbaitang) market was even weaker and deteriorating. The market fell by another 10 cents yesterday. 振记(Zhenji) No. 1 was 18.4 yuan, 振裕(Zhenyu) No. 1 was 18.3 yuan, 元儧(Yuancan) and 兴仁记(Xingrenji) No. 1 were both 18.15 yuan. 太古糖(Taikootang) B Mark was still firm at 19.95 yuan. Domestic sugar was also weak due to low sales. It was rumored that there were 喑盘(Yinpan) transactions, but the price must have been low.</p>

<p>潮州(Chaozhou) red rice has recently become scarce, and the market situation is very depressed. In addition, the price of rice is high, and the cost has increased, so there are few sources. Yesterday, it was heard that over 100 packages of No. 4 had arrived. The goods are still good and must be priced at around 33-34 yuan. Goods that were previously priced at 26 yuan are now priced at over 28.8 yuan, an increase of nearly 3 yuan.</p>

<p>The British and French raw silk markets have seen a decline in silk product sales, resulting in reduced production at most mills. Furthermore, cotton and woolen products are being launched on the market, further reducing the use of raw silk. As a result, it is still difficult for Chinese silk exports to improve. On the previous day, the British ship 苏曼里号(Sumanlihao) departed with only 190 pieces of yellow and white silk filaments, bound for ports such as London and Marseille. The price of white factory silk filaments has not changed. Yesterday, 50 packages arrived from 美文(Meiwen), and the price fell by more than 10 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e256">Autumn Rain Damages Silkworm Season <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>In the townships of 杭县(Hangxian), this year's autumn silkworm rearing has been hampered by the drought. Although supervisors advised and guided supplemental late silkworm rearing, the amount was still not robust. Early silkworms had a large quantity of lush leaves and were ready to spin cocoons. The late silkworms were opening leaves for the third molt, but since the beginning of autumn, there has been continuous heavy rain, causing sudden changes in the silkworms that ate rain-soaked leaves. Early silkworms with lush leaves were found to have jaundice, and early silkworms also had stagnant leaves and lost sleep. A bumper harvest is unlikely.</p>
<h3 id="e257">Oil Market Asphalt Price Fluctuates After Rise <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>The asphalt market in autumn was extremely prosperous. Since the beginning of autumn, its momentum reached a peak for a time, mainly because the supply in Hankou was insufficient, while buyers flocked to the market. Therefore, a month ago, the market price soared by two yuan. In addition, there was a severe drought in western Zhejiang, and the asphalt yield from cypress trees was only 20-30% of a normal year. Consequently, asphalt from Jiaxing was particularly expensive, jumping from 17 yuan per load to 20 yuan. However, there was no real demand, and the price increase was entirely driven by speculation, which is truly unbelievable. Recently, however, the weather has gradually cooled, and goods from Hankou have gradually arrived. Surprisingly, the market has become more sluggish than in early autumn. As a result, high-quality Jing asphalt from Hankou, which had risen to over 16 yuan per piece, has recently fallen back to around 15 yuan. Asphalt from Macheng has also fallen from 16 yuan to below 15 yuan. This shows that although inventory is scarce and the yield is low, demand is not as strong as in previous years. Therefore, although prices rose, they could not be sustained and had to fall back down. Currently, the local inventory is still very low, but sales are unusually slow. Since the Hankou market has fallen, the local market will naturally follow suit. Traders are offering high-quality Jing asphalt at 19 yuan per piece, ordinary Jing asphalt at 18.4 yuan, and Macheng asphalt at 16.45 yuan.</p>

<p>— Jun Peng</p>
<p>Little friends! We must know that this is a scientific world. A country without science will find it difficult to survive in this world. Who will create science for China? It is our little friends. Making ourselves into scientific children is also creating a scientific China.</p>
<p>Scientists are different from ordinary people. No matter what they encounter, they always maintain a questioning attitude: "Why is this so? How exactly does it work?" These questions constantly swirl in their minds, and they don't stop until they have thoroughly researched the matter!</p>
<p>Look! The American scientist Benjamin Franklin discovered the physics of white light reflection and black light absorption, and Isaac Newton invented the steam engine. I think you all know these stories. Both of these scientists were able to make these inventions because of these questions, discovering principles that ordinary people overlook.</p>
<p>Little friends! You should emulate the spirit of these two scientists, study nature, and strive to become scientists in the future. Hey! Little friends! Quickly take on the mission of creating a "scientific China."</p>

<p>— Ou</p>
<p>Little friends, you have all participated in school or extracurricular exams, right? If you consistently rank at the top, naturally you deserve to be proud. But if you rank low, I advise you not to be discouraged. I'll tell you the exam stories of two great men:</p>
<p>Napoleon, the great French hero, took an arts and sciences award exam at the Lycée de Lyon, and he ranked fifteenth out of sixteen candidates. But he wasn't discouraged. He remained very self-confident, believing that he was second only to God. Later, he indeed achieved his great ambition.</p>
<p>Zhang Jian, the top scholar of the late Qing dynasty and a great industrialist in the Republic of China era, took the provincial exam at the age of fifteen, and he ranked beyond one hundredth. His teacher severely reprimanded him, saying, "If a thousand people take the exam, only one person will fail, and that person is you!" He felt very depressed and wrote the words "nine hundred ninety-nine" on his window frame and the top of his mosquito net to inspire himself to study hard. In the end, he did achieve the top rank in the empire.</p>

<p>Tiny fireflies, lighting little lanterns; like little airplanes, soaring in the sky.</p>
<p>Tiny fireflies, with green fire glowing softly. Green little lightbulbs, the electric light never stops.</p>
<p>The Firefly Garden is in Yangzhou, a story left from the Sui Dynasty. Before electric lights were invented, there were only these childish games.</p>
<p>Emperor Yang of Sui had a Firefly Garden, and Che Yin had a firefly bag; one to help with diligent study, one to indulge in debauchery.</p>
<p>Fireflies are not formed from rotting grass; they have their own species. The end of their tails can emit light, a result of metabolism.</p>

<p>— Chen Shicong</p>
<p>Last time, I introduced a little friend who invented a telescope to you all. But this was accidental, and nothing special. Now I will introduce another little friend who made an invention through research to you all. I think everyone will be happy to hear about it.</p>
<p>This little inventor is German, named Webb, one year older than me—sixteen years old. He is a student. He had a scientific mind since he was a child and always wanted to invent something to contribute to the world. Others always laughed at him, but he was not discouraged by this. As the saying goes, where there is a will, there is a way. Recently, he invented a small electric boat and a wireless telegraph, and he can use wireless electricity to control the boat. The results are very good and he was commended by the government and praised by local people. Now he is preparing to build a larger boat that can carry people, still using wireless electricity to control it. It is expected that he will achieve considerable success.</p>
<p>Little friends, I hope that your thoughts and desires are like Webb's. Only then will China have a glimmer of hope.</p>
<h3 id="e263">How to Write a Diary <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Shouqiu</p>
<p>Aren't there diaries in school? But those kinds of diaries are just not good enough! Not only are they the same few sentences every day, but the writing is also crooked, some characters big, some small. So writing that kind of diary for another year or two won't be of much use.</p>
<p>Does the above mean that diaries shouldn't be written at all? Of course that's not right. But I advocate paying attention to the following points when writing a diary: (1) The handwriting should be neat; (2) The narrative should be detailed; (3) It should not be interrupted for a single day. Originally, the function of writing a diary has three aspects: first, everything done each day is recorded, which can be used for reference in the future; second, it can practice calligraphy; third, it can practice composition; because there are these three benefits, the diary has become an indispensable task for everyone. However, the way of writing must not be as perfunctory as the school diary. If you write in that kind of stereotyped way, of course you won't receive the effectiveness of writing a diary!</p>
<p>I believe that if little friends over the age of ten can write a diary every day without interruption, until they graduate from middle school, then their grammar and calligraphy will definitely be very good. Little friends! I want you to start writing diaries seriously from today. Now, I will tell you again how to write a diary: (1) Date; (2) Weather; (if you wish to write the day of the week, you can write it before the weather); (3) Events; (choose the more valuable events of the day to write down); (4) Thoughts; (thoughts on a certain person or a certain thing).</p>

<p>The police whistle was lost, and it turned out that Wang'er was stepping on it. Let's pick it up and play with it; "Qu qu..." Wang'er blew it frantically. The detectives thought they were chasing a thief, but pui! it was just this little rascal, making us panic!</p>
<h3 id="e265">Watermelon Lantern <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Ling</p>
<p>We often see large piles of half-eaten watermelon rinds next to the garbage bins. We know that these things can be pickled in salt and dried to become very crisp and delicious snacks. However, we still don't know that these things can also be made into a very delicate toy.</p>
<p>When eating watermelon, we should cut the watermelon at two-thirds of the way. Scoop out the flesh of the one-third part, eat it and discard it. Then use a spoon to scoop out the flesh of the two-thirds part, scrape it clean, eat it, and then we can start making our toy - the watermelon lantern.</p>
<p>We use a spoon to scrape off as much as possible from the inside of the watermelon rind, wherever it can be scraped off. It should be as thin as possible, as long as the skin of the watermelon is not damaged. Then use a sharp knife to carve some landscapes, figures, or flowers and plants on the black outer layer of the watermelon rind. Here we should pay attention to the fact that every line must have the black outer layer of the watermelon rind scraped away. Otherwise, when a candle is lit inside the watermelon rind, the pattern on the outside will become blurry.</p>
<p>After we have carved the pattern on the watermelon rind, we drill a nail into the bottom center of the watermelon to prepare for inserting a candle. At the same time, we tie a thin rope or thick thread around the watermelon, and tie it to one end of a bamboo pole. In this way, when we lift the bamboo pole, the watermelon rind will follow. The watermelon lantern is finished.</p>
<p>In the evening, we insert a candle onto the nail in the watermelon rind, light it, and the pattern on the watermelon rind is clearly illuminated by the candlelight, thick and thin, while the unscraped parts are pitch black. We carry it and walk in the yard, street, field, or riverbank in the night. How interesting it is!</p>

<p>— Yi Zhen</p>
<p>The little kingfisher flapped its wings, sang a song, and flew out of its home, happily flying into the sky; when tired, it stopped on this tree and rested on that tree. It liked this kind of journey the most.</p>
<p>"Whoosh!" Suddenly, a bullet brushed past its ear, and its little wings were injured. It shouted and fell straight down, landing right in a pile of hay and hiding itself. Soon, people's footsteps passed by its ear. When it crawled out, it saw that its right wing had been pierced by a bullet, and blood was flowing non-stop, like a spring.</p>
<p>"Because of these hateful wings, I almost lost my life. Fortunately, I was alert. If I didn't have wings, the bullet would have just glided past my ear quietly, and there wouldn't have been this danger..." The little kingfisher was thinking when a fairy happened to pass by, so it requested:</p>
<p>"Kind fairy, I hate these wings. Please cut them off for me!"</p>
<p>"Really? You really don't want them?" the fairy said softly. "Will you regret it?"</p>
<p>"Really! I will never regret it!" The little kingfisher shook its head and said.</p>
<p>So the fairy took away the little kingfisher's wings.</p>
<p>Without its wings, the little kingfisher was much lighter and played in the wheat fields all day long, which was also comfortable.</p>
<p>One day, the little kingfisher was looking around idly on the edge of the field when it suddenly saw a child running with a bamboo pole. It immediately hid in the field, but the child refused to let go and kept chasing after it, hitting it with the bamboo pole. "Thwack!" It was hit on the forehead and fainted. When it woke up, it found itself sleeping in a cage and had lost its freedom.</p>
<p>"Alas! There is nothing superfluous in the world. If I had had two wings at the time, this imprisonment would never have happened." Thinking of this, it cried sadly.</p>

<p>— Azalea</p>
<p>This is a very worthwhile thing to record. It's really strange! Ten out of ten children like billiards. Because it's easy to play, fun to play, and beneficial to physical health; therefore, children and billiards are simply inseparable day and night. They are very loving and good companions!</p>
<p>But unfortunately, things happen unexpectedly. For example, if several children are playing billiards and are in high spirits, suddenly the billiard ball is snatched by themselves or everyone and becomes defective, that is so boring; it bounces unevenly when played, jumping east and west, like an untamed wild horse, not willing to be controlled by itself! But it doesn't matter, you can buy some boiling water from the tiger stove and soak the billiard ball in the water. After a few minutes, you can find that the billiard ball's disease is cured.</p>
<p>Explanation: Because what is contained inside the billiard ball is air, and air cannot stand heat. Once heated, the body will gain weight and produce an expansion phenomenon. Curing billiard balls is using this little bit of physics.</p>

<p>If an iron nail is nailed into a wooden board for too long, it will rust firmly. Sometimes, no matter how you dig or clamp it, it won't move at all. But if you nail the iron nail in a little further, and then dig or clamp it, it will be easier. This is because it has separated from the iron rust.</p>

<p>Little friends! If you are wearing new shoes (or very tight shoes), and someone accidentally steps on you while walking or exercising, wouldn't it be very troublesome if there is no shoehorn at that time? But at this time, you can use your handkerchief, because it is a simple shoehorn!</p>

<p>When we write with a fountain pen, the ink often spreads out after we erase it with a rubber eraser. But there is also a remedy for this, which is that after you erase it with a rubber eraser, use your fingernail to rub it to make the paper smoother. Then there will be no problem when you write again.</p>

<p>— Mu Yin</p>
<p>Pinghu County was originally a town in Haiyan County, and its original name was Danghu Town. Later, due to its prosperity, the Ming Dynasty changed its name to Pinghu County and separated it from Haiyan County.</p>
<p>Little friends! I think many little friends must not know this history, so I will tell it here first. Now I want to tell you a folk legend of Pinghu.</p>
<p>Danghu Town was a very wealthy place during the Han Dynasty. The residents were always law-abiding and lived their happy lives. It is said that one day a general suddenly came there, wearing a military hat, military uniform, riding a white horse, and carrying a sword. He ran a big circle around Danghu Town; after running a circle, he stopped his horse and pointed his sword at the circle and said, "This place should be a lake." After he finished speaking, he turned around and ran away with a whip, but in the end, no one knew where he ran to.</p>
<p>Some residents who saw him at the time thought he was crazy and didn't care at all.</p>
<p>But on this night, there was suddenly a violent wind and rain, flying sand and rocks, which lasted all night. When everyone got up and opened the door the next day, they couldn't help but be surprised. It turned out that the circle that the man had circled yesterday had now turned into a lake! The people in that place were also buried and died in the water.</p>
<p>From then on, this place was called Danghu Town. But because its lake water was calm, it was called Pinghu.</p>

<p>— Yan Biguang</p>
<p>Dear little friends! Do you know that we all have two treasures on us? If you don't know, please look at the following six sentences:</p>
<p>"Life has two treasures,</p>
<p>Hands and brain,</p>
<p>Think and do;</p>
<p>You can't eat it up in a lifetime,</p>
<p>Don't think and don't do;</p>
<p>You can't eat enough in a lifetime."</p>
<p>These are the words of the great educator Tao Xingzhi. It's really true. We are still in school now. When we go to society to do things in the future, we must keep the above sentences firmly in mind and use our hands and brains together. Then we can't eat it up in a lifetime. Otherwise, we can only watch others eat and use, and we will not eat enough in a lifetime.</p>

<h3 id="e273">The Simplest Way to Catch Birds <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— Linghu Zhao</p>
<p>Little friends, catching birds is indeed very interesting. Think about it, it would be so happy to catch a lively and singing little bird! But if we spend our precious time catching birds, it would be too uneconomical and too un-cost effective. Therefore, I will introduce you to a tried and tested economical method. Not only will you not waste much time, but you can also enjoy great fun. You little friends may want to try it to find out.</p>
<p>Tools: A shovel, a thicker wooden board, three thin bamboos and a little rice.</p>
<p>Instructions: First, choose a place where birds gather, and place the wooden board flat on the ground. Use the bamboo to draw a boundary line according to the wooden board, and then take a shovel and dig a soil pit with a depth of three and a half inches according to the line boundary (Figure 1). After digging, insert half of the bamboo head into the mud at the bottom of the pit; then take another bamboo and make it lean horizontally on the inserted end, see (Figure 2). Further, use the last thin bamboo to support it obliquely at the midpoint of the horizontally placed bamboo, see (Figure 3). After these three bamboos are properly placed, you can very carefully place the wooden board flat on the inclined bamboo head, see (Figure 4). Finally, sprinkle a handful of rice in the pit, and it is done! You only need to stand five or six feet away and watch the birds enter the pit, the wooden board will collapse, and you will be ready to catch them.</p>
<p>(Appendix) When the bird flies into the soil pit, it will definitely stand on the horizontal bamboo to peck for food. The horizontal bamboo cannot bear the pressure of the bird, so it will fall down, and the wooden board will also cover it. The bird is trapped in the pit. However, when you reach into the pit to catch it, you must be very careful, otherwise your efforts will be in vain and your joy will be empty.</p>

<h3 id="e275">Abortion <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— Zi Jiu</p>
<p>"Abortion," in this world, is considered a crime everywhere except in the Soviet Union. Therefore, those who practice it have to do it secretly, and those who want an abortion have to do it even more secretly. Because it is done in secret, all kinds of problems arise. The newspapers of the 13th and 14th of this month all had reports of the Yu Yang abortion case in a legitimate hospital. The general idea is: "Mrs. Yu Yang, a boatwoman from Wuxi, because she disliked having too many children, came to Shanghai specifically to seek an abortion in a legitimate hospital. The two parties agreed on an abortion fee of 70 yuan, which included six pills, two bottles of liquid medicine, and two packets of powdered medicine. Mrs. Yang returned to the hotel and first took the pills, then the liquid medicine and powdered medicine. After five days, the fetal matter finally came out, but she was still in unbearable pain. In desperation, she sent someone to report to the Hongkou police station. The police station, on the grounds that abortion violated criminal law, brought the nurse—the doctor was on the run—the pregnant woman, and the fetal matter to the police station. The result of the trial was that Mrs. Yang was fined 80 yuan, and the nurse was released without charge..." From this news, one can also think of: it is often heard that a certain lady had an abortion in a certain hospital, costing hundreds of yuan, and a certain doctor specializes in secret abortions and makes a fortune. A certain woman sought a midwife's secret method for an abortion, and her life was buried. A certain lady took the so-called abortion elixir from a certain pharmacy, and the fetus did not come down and her whole body was swollen. A certain older sister took quinine to abort, and as a result, both ears became severely deaf. A certain sister-in-law privately took musk, and died from a massive hemorrhage, and other legends or facts. Rich people are being gouged by doctors, spending hundreds of yuan, which is not so important, but poor people have no access to treatment and have no choice but to seek midwives or medicines, and therefore lose their lives or become ill repeatedly. This is truly the most tragic and sorrowful thing in the world!</p>
<p>Examining the motives for wanting an abortion, they are roughly: (1) difficulty due to economic inability to educate and raise children, (2) enthusiasm for career, using this to reduce the trouble of raising children, (3) weak body, unable to withstand major childbirth, (4) pregnancy out of wedlock, fear of social slander, or no one to take responsibility for raising children, etc. But in this economic panic, in this current society where there is very little concern for the protection of children and women, we know that abortion will inevitably continue to flow and grow in the days to come. If we acknowledge that women and children are the pillars of humanity, it is necessary to urgently establish public, rational artificial abortion clinics or counseling centers. This is by no means advocating murder, but seeking happiness for humanity. Because rather than letting it do evil in secret, it is better to openly bring it into the right track. It is easier to manage and easier to monitor or restrict. As for the method, it is not within the scope of this article.</p>
<p>In addition, abortion is punishable by imprisonment under current Chinese law, which of course also needs to be researched and reformed. It is hoped that the current health administrators and legal scholars will pay attention to this.</p>
<h3 id="e276">The Soviet Wife (Continued, Part 3) <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— By Anna Loviie Strong, Translated by Liang Qiu</p>
<p>What standards do Soviet wives use to judge chastity and divorce? They don't use traditional standards, only those of personality and social value. For us, the family is not separate and independent from the whole world; it is a unit of the world, and its value depends on its relationship to the whole world. This socialized way of measuring the family was crudely expressed in a conversation with a young glassworker. When I met him, he was recuperating at a sanatorium. One evening, he told me how he hoped to embrace a woman. Because he had previously expressed the same hope for an apple and a cigarette, I was a little offended by his words, and I was somewhat irritated.</p>
<p>"You seem to have many desires," I said, unintentionally implying strong desires. He angrily denied it: "My only desire is the revolution, the rest are just hopes." "Is a woman, like an apple, just one of your hopes?" I asked him. He said very frankly, "Of course, the hope for a woman is more serious, because it is related to the foundation of life and can affect the future. But even if a person is married, he cannot always be with his wife. This is also a temporary hope, which ends when it is satisfied. For me, there is only one permanent desire. That is to work with all my strength for the authority of the Soviets and to make the revolution penetrate the world."</p>
<p>"What about the woman in your desire?" I asked. "I hope she can be my comrade," he said indifferently, "otherwise, my feelings for her will not last."</p>
<p>Once, I lived in the same apartment as a twenty-year-old woman for a year. Several times I saw a young man who loved her spend the night in her room, and afterwards, I was surprised that she was still a virgin. She seemed very surprised at my surprise. She explained to me that the young man came to see her from another city, and because he had no place to live, he stayed with her, just like her girlfriends. "In our factory, almost every female worker is a virgin," she said. "Occasionally, there are two or three women who have casual relationships with men, but they are frivolous and do not work hard, and we despise them. Most women are afraid of having relationships with men." "Are they afraid for physiological reasons?" I asked her. "No, they are afraid of the consequences for us. A woman named Anna obviously changed after she got married. Although she did not leave the Youth Communist League, she did not neglect her work; but she lost her inherent interest and vitality. Perhaps she was pregnant, and her body was not as healthy as before. You see, a person's life can be so depressed; their interest in social undertakings can be so lost! This is the reason why we are afraid. We cannot pay too much attention to personal life before we have a solid social foundation." This attitude is understood by almost every unmarried woman in the Soviet Union, although most women are not so timid. Many young married couples are still studying at universities, the men living in male dormitories, the women living in female dormitories, and their children are placed in nurseries set up by the university. In this way, Soviet youth combine personal life and social responsibility. Therefore, personal "love" is not necessarily a threat to social interests; many people increase their interest in society because of it. But the ultimate goal of any of our marriages! Is not the mutual loyalty of the parties, but the mutual loyalty to social work.</p>
<p>Divorce, in the Soviet Union, happens as it does in other countries; but our morals regarding divorce are completely different from those in the rest of the world. In our country, any married person has the possibility of divorce at any time. Our legal theory believes that it is illegal to force a sexual union against a person's will. Many people divorce quietly, eliminating misunderstandings between them in a noble "agreement," which we believe is respectable and most reasonable, but which New York believes is the most immoral. In the United States, the two parties in a divorce publicly accuse each other in court of abuse or shameless behavior, which we see as despicable and rude. On the front page of a New York newspaper, it was reported that a husband sat outside his wife's room all winter night to watch her lover come out of her room. Our comment on this was: "A complete fool," or even crazy, spending the whole night in discomfort to find out things he didn't want to know! If he wanted his wife back, should he have done this? If he didn't want her back, why not forget the past sooner?" In our country, jealousy is not a praiseworthy virtue, but a remnant of cursed suffering.</p>

<p>— Bi Wu</p>
<p>It is rare for ordinary women to be as good as Yang Guifei of the Yang family. If the environment allows or encourages her to decorate herself, she will not "dislike the grease and powder for staining her color" and lightly sweep her eyebrows. In ancient times, in times of peace, men were refined and romantic, and women were light and charming. At this time, it was appropriate for women to do some makeup.</p>
<p>But in times of sorrow and mourning, like when the Northeast was initially lost three years ago, the whole country cried until their tears ran dry and their voices became hoarse, and women also looked haggard and disfigured. Even the most prosperous campus queen in the most prosperous Shanghai took off her bright clothes, and the so-called "blue cloth movement" became popular. This shows that everyone has the same patriotism in their hearts; when the environment does not allow them, women have not completely lost their conscience.</p>
<p>Time flies, carrying the painful past to the depths of the sea, bringing spring flowers and autumn moons, and painting a beautiful and happy world again. Gentlemen talk about Buddha and ghosts, about women and immortals; ladies put on lipstick and paint their eyebrows, oil their calves and dye their nails. There is a great atmosphere of peace, which can comfort some people who admire the ancients.</p>
<p>It's just that, if she occasionally looks at her heavily made-up self in the mirror and recalls the appearance of her blue cloth clothes three years ago, she secretly doesn't know whether to be happy or ashamed? In three years, the national crisis has not diminished slightly, but she has become like two different people before and after.</p>
<p>Some people compare our national crisis to a woman's childbirth; during childbirth, there is a burst of wailing and screaming, and after childbirth, she embraces her child with joy. This seems very appropriate at first glance, but it is actually irrelevant upon closer inspection. A woman giving birth to a child is creation, is new life; while a national crisis is a noose around the neck. If you must find a metaphor for the national crisis on women, I think it is best to compare it to a carbuncle. I once heard of a woman who had a carbuncle on her face. At first, she thought it was a freckle or a pimple, and covered it with thick grease and powder, thinking she could hide it, but she lost her life because of it.</p>
<p>The poison of the three-year national crisis has gradually deepened; but we are flowing into romance and beauty, grease and powder. It would be too strange not to be destroyed by this. Naturally, the enemy's cannons are indeed far away at this time; but taking this opportunity to create an atmosphere of peace, thinking that the world should be ours to talk and smile, and indulge in pleasure, this is truly a monster. I don't know how many women are sacrificed in this atmosphere. Using useful time for useless decoration; in the end, when disaster strikes, they think that the country was destroyed by those who dressed extravagantly. Fools only know how to float and sink with the tide, and even if they suffer the injustice of being wrongly accused, it is not a pity.</p>
<p>If women are not ignorant and look squarely at the current national crisis, will she only have the courage of the "blue cloth movement" three years ago, or will she have a more dignified attitude to correct the environment of grease and powder? What can be done to her?</p>

<h3 id="e279">On the Physiological and Lifestyle Influences of Female Writers <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Junye</p>
<p>By a chance opportunity, I saw the Tianjin Yongbao newspaper of the 29th of last month at a friend's place. On another page of the supplement, I read an article titled "Comments on Japanese Female Writers," with the subtitle "Shifts in Thought Are Mostly Related to Physiology," which aroused my interest.</p>
<p>The first paragraph of this article reads: "Open a history of literature, and you won't see a woman's work called a masterpiece. This may be due to the social relations of the time. But now, even in the Soviet Union, you can't see a masterpiece like 'Virgin Soil Upturned.' This may be due to the physiological relationship of women. In China, there are only three or four female writers left; the rest have disappeared or died. But in neighboring Japan, female writers are developing... In advance, I discovered a surprising physiological influence, that is, female writers mostly accept the hints of their husbands. In physiology, after a woman has intercourse with a man, the man's qualities exist in the woman's blood, and in fact, her thoughts are also contaminated with many hints, such as Ding Ling being influenced by Hu Yepin, Kubokawa Inako being influenced by Kubokawa Tsurujiro, Nakajo being influenced by Miyamoto Kenji, and Hirabayashi Taiko being influenced by Kobori Jinji. This is a very obvious phenomenon."</p>
<p>From the above passage, we can easily see that the author of this article attributes the reason why female writers cannot produce masterpieces to physiological influences, which I think is very questionable.</p>
<p>First of all, I don't quite believe the sentence "Open a history of literature, and you won't see a woman's work called a masterpiece." The history of literature tells us that there are many good works produced by female writers. For example, to give just two examples, George Sand's pastoral novels in the French Romantic era are in no way inferior to male writers of the same era such as Alfred de Musset (in terms of artistic evaluation), is one example; the Soviet modern female writers Seifulina, Inber, and Shaginyan also have many successful works, which we must not obliterate. Speaking of Ding Ling in China, her novels have already been established and need not be explained here.</p>
<p>If we say that there have not been as many female writers as male writers in the history of literature, this statement is tenable. But the reason is not due to the physiological function of women. "After a woman has intercourse with a man, the man's qualities exist in the woman's blood..." and so on is completely insufficient to explain the reason why female writers are subordinate to men. The reason why there are fewer female writers than male writers in the history of literature must be attributed to the social reasons of the male-centered system. Taking our China as an example, in the past, women (even now) could not have much contact with social life at all, so it is of course difficult for them to demand the same literature as men. George Sand in France was a figure who betrayed the traditional ideas of the old society in thought and life, and her rich life enabled him to produce relatively considerable works, while Li Qingzhao in China could only write her melancholic poetry, which was also limited by her life. But in today's Soviet Union, the situation is very different. Seifulina and Shaginyan, as female workers, can produce amazing works, and the reason lies here, life comes first. (La Vie avant tout!)</p>
<p>As for saying that Ding Ling was influenced by Hu Yepin, Kubokawa Inako was influenced by Kubokawa Tsurujiro, and Nakajo was influenced by Miyamoto Kenji, it would be completely wrong to insist that this was due to their intercourse with their husbands. This statement may have been greatly influenced by Freud's poisonous thoughts! Rather than saying that this influence comes from the intercourse between the two parties, it is more likely that it comes from the mutual influence of habits and thoughts in their common life.</p>
<p>Regarding the failure of female writers to produce as rich creations as male writers, correct conclusions cannot be obtained from Freudian physiological explanations. There are already enough jokes made by Freudianism! If we want to find out the reasons why there are not many female writers and their works are not rich, we can only use historical materialism as the basis for our answer!</p>
<h3 id="e280">What Should We Do During the Transition Period? <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>—The Wise Mother and Good Wife System—</p>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Li Hu's "Let Me Also Talk About Wise Mothers and Good Wives" and then Mr. Fei's "Who is Driving History Backwards," I couldn't help but have a very good feeling. I feel that Chinese people who pay attention to society are indeed more rational than before. They don't just yell based on their temporary feelings and ideals, regardless of the facts. Of course, there are exceptions, but it's much better!</p>
<p>I admire Mr. Fei's spirit of seeking "truth." He feels that men and women should have equal education and everything else equal for various reasons. That's right, as long as they are people, they should enjoy all equal rights! Mr. Fei's suggestion is good, "Why doesn't men's education embrace being a good husband and a wise father?" "Can women only be wise mothers and good wives?" But the question comes:</p>
<p>We don't approve of the "wise mother and good wife system," and of course we also oppose the good husband and wise father system. The same people should of course work for society equally and do their best to do social undertakings in society! However, in this way, what should we do with children and families? Although Mr. Fei stated, "This does not mean that men and women do not need 'cooperation,' 'assistance,' or do not raise and educate children..." But, under the mutual evasion of "wise mothers and good wives" and "good husbands and wise fathers," in addition to Mr. Liu Dabai's proposed "1. Organize public kitchens, 2. Establish public nurseries or public daycare centers," we have some doubts about the "disposal" of a group of children and families. What Mr. Fei said is in line with the ideal society. Before reaching the ideal society, of course we should not "refrain from eating for fear of choking." Should we be responsible for educating new children for those children who are mutually shirked? Should we have management responsibilities in the family, even if it is a very small matter? May I ask what Mr. Fei's ideal of cooperation, assistance, or raising and educating children is? Mr. Shao Lizi also said, "I absolutely agree with the issue of public childcare. I believe that when society is fundamentally transformed, this is an indispensable condition. If children are not raised publicly, labor issues and women's issues cannot be resolved." This shows that Mr. Shao Lizi "If children are not raised publicly, labor issues and women's issues cannot be resolved" focuses on "the fundamental transformation of society." What about the transition period? Should we ignore everything about the children, let them be, and not ask about the family, and concentrate on doing things in society and studying academics for society? The problem lies here.</p>
<p>In fact, Mr. Fei did not say that men and women should go to social groups at any time, and even more did not mention what should be done during the transition period. Mr. Fei's article "Who is Driving History Backwards" is just an article "Respectfully Questioning Mr. Li Hu." In this way, what I said above may be a bit "incongruous." But the serious problem is in the transition period. I think after Mr. Fei wrote "Who is Driving History Backwards," he should write another "Aftermath of Wise Mothers and Good Wives," otherwise the results advocated by Mr. Fei and Ms. Yunqi would be unimaginable!</p>
<p>As long as people with a little knowledge feel that the transition period is important. Mr. Sun Yat-sen emphasized the period of political tutelage in order to achieve the goal of constitutional government. If Mr. Fei and Ms. Yunqi are believers who support equality between men and women, then what attitude and methods should they adopt towards the current contradictory transition society? Are the previous proposals of the gentlemen feasible? Best wishes, Pan Yihong</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Since this magazine published Ms. Yunqi's article "Talking about the Wise Mother and Good Wife System," readers have sent in articles for discussion. Due to space limitations, we cannot publish them all. We had no choice but to select Mr. Li Hu's "Let Me Also Talk About the Wise Mother and Good Wife System" and publish it in the 29th issue of this magazine, and then publish Mr. Fei's article "Who is Driving History Backwards" in the 30th issue. Now, articles discussing this issue are still pouring in, including a letter from Mr. Pan Yihong, asking to find appropriate methods during this transition period. Now, in order to solicit readers' opinions and for the sake of public discussion, Mr. Pan's original letter is published here. Please readers express your opinions.</p>
<h3 id="e281">Girl Fisha <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— Ding</p>
<p>Was it in the autumn six years ago?</p>
<p>When Fisha was still a young girl, her life was full of purity and enthusiasm. She had a pretty face, bright eyes, crescent eyebrows, cherry lips, and a dimpled smile. She was lively in nature and innocent in posture.</p>
<p>And her kind of organized speech, sensible, without the pedantry and restraint of old-fashioned family ladies, this aroused a kind of pride in her, or it can be said to be a reason for her self-esteem and arrogance.</p>
<p>Anyway, her kind of special quality aroused the pursuit and admiration of many men, as for women? Among her friends of the same sex, it can be said that eight or nine out of ten hated her, despised her, and envied her.</p>
<p>However, Fisha was completely a girl. She had a warm heart, and she seemed indifferent to those things.</p>
<p>Regarding her own future, she harbored a line of far-reaching hope. Her ideal was that there should be no distinction between women and men in terms of superiority or inferiority. She felt that women were no weaker than men. Indeed, in front of her, there were countless men kneeling at her skirt. She despised them. She hated those dull-witted guys. She looked down on a man who didn't look like a man at all.</p>
<p>Therefore, her vision expanded even more. She always hoped that she could become an outstanding woman, loved, praised, and admired by all the young men and women. She had an unusual temper, that is, she did not want, nor did she allow any men or women to have that kind of expression or behavior that despised her or disdained her. But she was not like ordinary women, who liked to be pretentious and shy in order to win people's favor. She often looked down on her own sex. She despised those frivolous women who were willing to degenerate and be played with. She felt that many women thought that they were not meant to be successful from birth, and that they were willing to be trampled on, but she would never admit this inferiority.</p>
<p>She liked to associate with men, wanting to absorb some fresh air in the atmosphere of the opposite sex, wanting to know a little more about the world, and learn some experiences and knowledge that were difficult to obtain among her own sex. She understood very well that spinning around in the circle of women all the time was of no benefit to her, but her interaction with men was not indiscriminate, nor did she mess around with people. She was determined to throw herself into the furnace of men and temper her. To cast and melt her personality, life, and physique, so that she can become a healthy human being. She knew that it was not enough to rely solely on the masculine, upright, and stubborn temperament, and it would not work to only have the feminine, gentle, and emotional aspect of women. A person, she felt, should have both kinds of temperament!</p>
<p>At first, when she was studying at a church school, needless to say, her thoughts were backward, stained with the smell of foreign slave education, the kind of thinking of a new-style bourgeois lady. She rebelled against the forms of feudal life, but she had no national consciousness.</p>
<p>Later, after leaving church school, her age gradually grew, and the contact with various figures in society made her gradually discover her own shortcomings. She felt great shame, great remorse, and disgust for her past erroneous words and deeds.</p>
<p>And one thing made her indignant, that is, among the women she had recently befriended, she was often ridiculed and scolded. She felt very uneasy in her heart. She felt that she was no worse than them. In ordinary worldly matters, she was confident that she was stronger than Jun Man, Qing Fen, and Ellie. How could she be insulted instead? Did they rely on some mysterious power to make her unable to resist?</p>
<p>Later, she gradually realized that her cleverness, arrogance, and that modern attitude were the biggest reasons for their aversion. This made her feel even more dissatisfied. Is it that their kind of simple, clumsy behavior should be praised? But no matter what, she always felt wronged, which made her distressed, made her depressed, and made her become angry.

<p>Special Issue of the Telecommunications Conference</p>
<h3 id="e282">Preface <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Bing</p>
<p>The Telecommunications Conference was held from the 4th to the 6th of this month in the auditorium of the Ministry of Transportation in the capital. The attendees were numerous and orderly, and the results obtained were also very satisfactory. It can be said that it was an unprecedented grand event. The reporter participated in it and felt that the atmosphere of all parties was harmonious and amiable, and the opinions expressed were also sincere and sincere. Telecommunications includes radio and telephone. People may suspect that there are sectarian views, but if you try to carefully observe the content of the venue, you will find that it is a fusion of water and milk, and a cooperative effort. The development of the future of telecommunications can be said to have been fully grasped at this conference.</p>
<p>The reason why the Ministry of Transportation convened responsible personnel from the telecommunications departments of various provinces to hold a conference was mentioned by the reporter in the previous issue of this magazine. In recent years, although many policies have been implemented regarding the development of telecommunications services, the rectification and expansion of telecommunications lines, and the convenience of the public and increased efficiency, there are still regrets. Therefore, at this conference, the Ministry of Transportation sought detailed information on the situation in various places, extensively adopted many suggestions, and formed a practical and universal method, so that the situation gradually entered the right track, and the telecommunications industry could also advance with it. It cannot be compared with those who make high-sounding remarks and leave some impressions as material for post-event discussions.</p>
<p>Because of the satisfactory results of the conference, the harmonious feelings of all parties, and the promising development of the future of the industry, this magazine is happy to compile speeches, describe the actual situation, and issue it as a special issue. Readers who think about the importance of my country's telecommunications industry and look at this telecommunications conference can get a glimpse of the efforts of the transportation authorities.</p>
<h3 id="e283">Reading President Wang’s Address at the Telecommunications Policy Conference <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>The Telecommunications Policy Conference convened by the Ministry of Transportation has already opened on the 4th of this month. It is truly a grand event to gather talents together and broadly collect opinions from the public. At the time, President of the Executive Yuan, Mr. Wang Jingwei, graciously attended and delivered a speech of several thousand words. He incisively pointed out the reasons for the underdevelopment of telecommunications policy and the policies that should be adopted in the future, deeply hitting the current ills. After listening to the speech, the reporter couldn't help but feel a sense of solemn respect! The importance of Mr. Wang's address must be described:</p>
<p>Mr. Wang said, "Since the national crisis, among the various construction projects, the two ministries of Transportation and Railways have been striving for progress amidst the crisis and have achieved relatively good results. ... Postal and telecommunications, facing the same difficulties and suffering the same great losses, have, through the efforts and struggles of Minister Zhu and all responsible personnel, achieved their current results amidst the national crisis and other natural and man-made disasters." Since the September 18th Incident, among the state-run enterprises that have been hit, besides railways, postal and telecommunications have been the most affected. Taking telecommunications policy as an example, the losses included more than 230 reporting and telephone bureaus, more than 87,000 li of lines, and an annual loss of more than 3.1 million yuan in operating revenue. More than 3,000 colleagues were displaced and forced to live under the iron hooves of the puppet government, suffering the extreme pain of the world. However, to recover lost territory, it is essential to strengthen national power and work hard on construction. Based on the above sole objective, our transportation authorities have actively reorganized telecommunications policy. Significant achievements have been made in administrative reform, business improvement, engineering construction, and financial unification, which are a world apart from the chaotic situation of a few years ago. This process of struggling through difficulties gives us an important enlightenment: that telecommunications workers, under the guidance of the competent authorities, have doubled their efforts because they deeply realize that without promoting national consciousness, there is no way to talk about saving the nation and seeking survival; and without hard work on construction, there is no way to promote national consciousness. Is it not said that "national revival comes from many hardships"?</p>
<p>Mr. Wang also said, "Originally, the telecommunications industry is a very promising one, but since the Republic of China, the reason why it has not been fully developed is because it has been affected by military and political affairs. ... As a result, the future of telecommunications policy has been greatly affected and hit hard, all because the military and political organs do not understand that the telecommunications industry is commercial in nature." He also said, "The destruction by military and political organs should make them understand that the damage to state-run enterprises is also damage to their own interests." How deeply and painfully Mr. Wang spoke! Since the dynastic change, domestic politics has been unable to be unified, and conflicts over cities and land have been heard from time to time! The telecommunications industry has been almost completely destroyed as a result! Such as the abuse of military telegrams, the arbitrary appointment of bureau chiefs, the seizure of telecommunications funds, and the cutting of line poles, all of which have dealt fatal blows to telecommunications policy. Because domestic politics cannot be unified, the telecommunications industry cannot be developed. Because the telecommunications industry cannot be developed, domestic politics cannot be unified, the two being mutually cause and effect, and mutually related. Now that politics is gradually becoming clearer and telecommunications policy is making progress day by day, it can be seen from this Telecommunications Policy Conference that the heads of telecommunications policy from Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces have all come to the capital together to participate in the grand event. It can also be seen from the conference agenda that most of them focus on the overall plan for national telecommunications policy, and that unblocking remote communications is a matter of utmost urgency. From now on, national telecommunications policy has entered a unified period, and it is inevitable that the unification of telecommunications policy will promote the unification of politics. It is hoped that the military and political organs will deeply remember Mr. Wang's purpose, understand that telecommunications is commercial in nature, and also understand that destroying telecommunications is harming themselves. This should be given special attention by the military and political organs and the people of the whole country.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Wang put forward the policy of the Executive Yuan, which is "commercializing state-run enterprises," and the key to promoting this policy lies in "working together," which is a timeless argument today. State-run enterprises are most prone to bureaucratization. In the past few decades, telecommunications policy has been corrupted due to the influence of bureaucratic politics! To reform, it is necessary to implement commercialization. However, given the size of the country and the complexity of the telecommunications industry, it will not be successful without the concerted efforts of the whole country. In recent years, the telecommunications authorities have taken commercialization as the basis for telegram business, such as entrusting travel agencies to collect telegrams to facilitate telegrams for travelers; creating social telegrams to open up ways to use telegrams. Setting up business inspectors for liaison, adding proofreaders to avoid errors. Reducing the price of urgent telegrams, separately setting the charging method for the name and address of the recipient, exempting postage for telegrams forwarded by mail, and transit fees for telegrams forwarded by road, in order to reduce the cost of telegrams for the people, and the two methods of joint postal and telecommunications offices and merged bureaus and stations have the sole objective of saving expenses and facilitating the people. All these are policies of vigorous commercialization. As for the "working together" section, it is also a recent proposal of the Ministry. For example, the principle of entrusting provincial governments to handle long-distance telephones promulgated last year is the basis for cooperation with the provincial governments. This is in line with Mr. Wang's address.</p>
<p>Recalling the outbreak of the national crisis, Mr. Wang used "seeking unity through construction" as the slogan for saving the nation and seeking survival. For the past two years, Mr. Wang has been in charge of the country and has worked hard to realize it. At this Telecommunications Policy Conference, Mr. Wang delivered a speech with a sincere attitude. We should sincerely accept it, so as not to fail the great intention of our leader's eager desire for governance. In modern warfare, there is something called general mobilization, which means that under the supreme leader and the sole objective, everyone works hard on their own duties, and at the same time, everyone strengthens their national consciousness. This is where the telecommunications workers serve the country, and this is where they save themselves.</p>
<h3 id="e284">Answering Mr. Du He on the Matter of "Slow Telegrams Instead of Mail" <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— Yuncheng</p>
<p>On the 6th of this month, the Shanghai News' New Garden published a conversation with Du He, the gist of which was that his younger brother, Yinwu, went to Guangzhou to attend the National Lawyers Association, and sent a telegram on the 31st of last month, but it was not received until 2:00 AM on the 2nd of this month, with an interval of 36 hours. (On the same day, the newspaper received a news telegram in only three hours). As a result, his whole family was very anxious. (Because the ship schedule would never be so slow). He wrote to the local telegraph office to inquire about this matter. According to the reply received by telephone, it seemed that the responsibility for the delay did not lie with the Shanghai Bureau, but with the Guangdong Bureau. But no matter which side delayed it, it can be seen that the situation of commercial telegrams being suppressed is still unavoidable. Although his matter is small, ordinary commercial telegrams are more important. If they are delayed for no reason, is it reasonable? Did this Telecommunications Policy Conference propose any methods to improve such a major shortcoming of "slow telegrams instead of mail"?</p>
<p>I am writing this article in response to Mr. Du He, not to defend the telegraph office, and even less to say that Mr. Du He's remarks are somewhat extreme. No - after reading Mr. Du He's remarks, I feel that he is indeed an old hand at talking for many years. Not only is it pleasant to listen to, but some places are indeed calm and very fair. For example, he said: "Since the establishment of the National Government, there seems to have been some progress in transportation administration in comparison." We express our great admiration for Mr. Du He's fair attitude. Because to be honest: the telegraph lines between Shanghai and South China have always been unable to be fully repaired and smooth due to political reasons. This is an open secret. If it were in the old days of warlords, it would be very common for a telegram from Guangzhou to Shanghai to take not only 36 hours, but even 72 hours or even 144 hours. Therefore, if it were in that era, a person like Mr. Du He who understands the situation would never be surprised. On the contrary, in countries with excellent and developed telecommunications in Europe and America, the speed of telegrams is measured in seconds. Then, if a news telegram from Guangzhou to Shanghai takes three hours, Mr. Du He may consider it satisfactory, but the people of that country must be as surprised as if it took 36 hours. Therefore, we not only do not feel disgusted by Mr. Du He's protest this time, but also feel that this is precisely the proof that the transportation authorities' efforts to improve telecommunications policy in recent years have achieved considerable results. To use a literary phrase, it can be said that "it is like the sound of footsteps in an empty valley," which makes people happy to hear.</p>
<p>However, although Mr. Du He is a giant in the literary world, he is still an outsider to the telegraph industry, so he is inevitably a bit misunderstood in his words. How do I know? Because he said, "Commercial telegrams are suppressed," and then said, "For no reason, they are delayed at will," as if the people in the telegraph office are all enemies with commercial telegrams, so they deliberately suppress them. He does not know that the income from commercial telegrams is the source of livelihood for the telegraph office staff. Commercial telegrams are their relatives, so why would they deliberately make things difficult for them! Then, Mr. Du He may ask, "Why does a news telegram from Guangzhou to Shanghai only take three hours, but my telegram takes 36 hours?" - Yes, please calm down, Mr. Du He, and let me explain it a little.</p>
<p>Originally, there are two wired circuits and one wireless circuit between Shanghai and Guangzhou. (In addition, there are two underwater lines from foreign companies, which connect Shanghai to Hong Kong and then to Guangzhou) The wireless circuit is direct, but its capacity is limited and cannot transmit all the telegrams between North China, Central China, and South China. One wired circuit is the near road along the coast, from Shanghai to Fuzhou, and from Fuzhou to Guangzhou. One is the long road that detours, from Shanghai to Hankou, Hankou to Changsha, Changsha to Hengzhou, Hengzhou to Shaoguan, and Shaoguan to Guangzhou. The news telegram mentioned by Mr. Du He probably took the wireless circuit, or even paid double the price to take the underwater line of a foreign company. And his brother's telegram took the near road of the coastal land line. Unfortunately, when this telegram just arrived in Fuzhou, the land line from Fuzhou to Shanghai was blocked due to irresistible reasons (everyone knows the reason), so it had to be returned and take the long road that detours. In this way, the time was inevitably delayed. At that time, the Guangzhou Telegraph Office did not send the telegram to the wireless station for transmission, which was a bit wrong. But we know that the transmission capacity of wireless is limited. If the wireless circuit was already very crowded at that time, it would be useless to send it over.</p>
<p>In short, I dare not say that the telegraph office is definitely not at fault in this matter - on this point, it is expected that the transportation authorities, which are known for their responsibility, will thoroughly investigate and give Mr. Du He a satisfactory answer. But even if the telegraph office is at fault, I can guarantee that it is definitely not intentional. Because the telegraph office relies on telegrams to make a living, just as the newspaper office relies on news to make a living. When newspapers publish news, it is sometimes inevitable that they are inaccurate due to insufficient coverage. If someone claims that the newspaper office specializes in spreading rumors based on this, I think Mr. Du He will definitely shout冤 (wāng) (to claim injustice) as well.</p>
<h3 id="e285">The Telecommunications Industry After the Telecommunications Policy Conference <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<h3 id="e286">The Characteristics of the Telecommunications Policy Conference <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— Guosong</p>
<p>When the Telecommunications Policy Conference was about to open, the previous issue of this journal had already informed the people of the country of the three missions undertaken by the conference, namely, to discuss the implementation of plans, to sort out communication methods, and to study the improvement of business. Originally, the convocation of the conference was because the Minister of Transportation was eager to understand the telecommunications situation in various places in order to make overall plans and thoroughly rectify it. He specially invited the responsible personnel from various places to come to Nanjing to calmly discuss and gather public opinions widely for the reference of the Ministry. Therefore, the conference strived to minimize the scale and focused on implementation. It was neither a representative conference with restricted voting rights, nor a propaganda conference with external publicity. In other words, the conference was entirely an internal discussion and internal reorganization conference, so no reporters were present at the opening, and no declarations were issued at the closing.</p>
<p>Now, the Telecommunications Policy Conference opened on the 4th of this month, and the review, discussion and resolution were completed after three days, and it closed on the 6th. In total, there were more than 400 proposals at the conference. However, by summarizing them, they are nothing more than plans for the construction of wired, wireless and telephone circuits, the improvement of business operations, the training of personnel, and the reorganization of finance and the strengthening of the organization. Most of the resolutions were requested to be selected and implemented by the Ministry and Departments, because most of the proposals are principles and principles, and the specific measures are often vague. How to implement them, the value of deliberation and gains and losses is of great research value. The Telecommunications Department is the competent authority for telecommunications policy. It should carefully and thoroughly handle various proposals based on objective environment and factual basis, and distinguish between urgency and urgency, so that it is appropriate.</p>
<p>Some say: I have heard a lot about conferences. I still remember the Transportation Conference in the seventeenth year. How enthusiastic and great it was at that time! After the conference, there was silence, just like the end of the play, leaving only feelings. Can the Telecommunications Policy Conference be similar? I say: Not so! The spirit of the conference does not depend on the conference itself, but on the motivation and determination of the convener. The former Transportation Conference had a wide scope, the purpose was not specific, the personnel were involved, and the opinions were particularly complex. More proposals were about administration and less about technology. Therefore, the result was only the abolition of a Telecommunications Bureau, and there was no great contribution to the improvement of business operations, the design of projects. As for this Telecommunications Policy Conference, the Ministry of Transportation listened to the opinions of national experts as a reference for policy implementation, and at the same time informed them of the policies set by the Ministry and Departments, in order to achieve cooperation between the top and bottom. Emphasize implementation rather than empty talk, emphasize negotiation rather than eloquence, emphasize the development of the industry rather than the competition for rights. The motivation is pure, the goal is single, the determination is born of sincerity, and the conscience can be good. Success or failure, profits and losses, can be foreseen, which is not the same as the Transportation Conference. Is the spirit of the Telecommunications Policy Conference in this?</p>
<h3 id="e287">What I Saw at the Telecommunications Policy Conference <a href="#e287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— Reporter</p>
<p>Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, various meetings have been held frequently. At the beginning, all the participants were excited and their blood was surging, thinking that various problems could be solved after the meeting. By the time of the opening, everyone was mostly perfunctory and irresponsible, or debated angrily and refused to yield to each other. After the closing, things passed, the situation changed, the smoke dissipated, and only a huge book of proposals was left for people to browse. Some people said that this kind of problem is due to the fact that the indolence of the Chinese people cannot be eradicated, others said that it is due to the fact that the Chinese people do not know the policies of the meeting, and others said that it is due to the fact that the competent authorities have no sincerity to implement it. Therefore, every meeting gives us a bad impression.</p>
<p>However, this Telecommunications Policy Conference cannot be viewed with the above prejudices. Because the motivation for the Ministry of Transportation to convene this meeting was to understand the situation in various places in order to make overall plans and thoroughly rectify it. Therefore, the purpose of the meeting was to invite national telecommunications experts to discuss and study together, so as to contribute various reform materials to the transportation authorities. Therefore, it does not emphasize form but emphasizes spirit, and does not advocate exclusive action but advocates cooperation. Between the members and the Ministry and Departments, there must be mutual trust between the top and bottom, and between the members and the members, there must be a harmonious relationship. There is no resentment, no disappointment, and no need for lobbying skills. Meet each other frankly and sincerely, this is the difference between the Telecommunications Policy Conference and various meetings.</p>
<p>Since the Telecommunications Policy Conference has special points, its results should have special achievements. What I can see, I write it on the left:</p>
<p>(1) The Spirit of Unity: According to the telecommunications industry, whether in terms of administration, technology, or business, it has a consistent nature as a whole, and there is no difference due to geographical relations and political changes. However, since the Republic of China, the telecommunications policy of our country has been affected by politics and military affairs, and it has been separated, disintegrated, and destroyed! The telecommunications reports of the southwestern provinces have not been reported to the central government for verification. Therefore, although the Ministry of Transportation has plans for overall calculation, it is difficult to implement. Because the telecommunications policy cannot be unified, there are many gaps in the political situation. Because of the gaps in the political situation, the telecommunications policy needs to be unified. At this Telecommunications Policy Conference, the heads of telecommunications policy from Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou, the southwestern provinces, all arrived in Beijing on schedule to participate in the grand event. This is a major event in the history of telecommunications policy. After attending this meeting, the gentlemen from the southwest will report the actual situation in various places to the central government, and convey the central government's hard work in striving for governance to various places. The opinions of each other are close, and the spirit has become consistent. The unification of telecommunications policy is not far away.</p>
<p>(2) The Spirit of Cooperation: According to the construction of wireless telegraphs in our country began formally after the seventeenth year. Because the system is excellent and the equipment is perfect, domestic and foreign communications have considerable achievements and show their talents. At the same time, wired telecommunications is not willing to lag behind and is catching up quickly. In the past few years, the sound of wireless telecommunications conflicts has often shaken our ears. In fact, both wireless and wireless telecommunications have their own advantages and disadvantages. They should cooperate closely with each other and should not attack each other. This is the rational statement. However, the previous transportation authorities have no means to quickly cut through the mess, and have no attitude of holding upright and impartiality. Wireless telecommunications, although under the direct jurisdiction of the Ministry of Transportation, still exists in a confrontational situation. Since Minister Zhu took office, he has been honest, impartial, talented, and has spared no effort in reorganizing telecommunications policy. Therefore, in April this year, he resolutely merged the national bureaus and stations one by one. The disputes over the years have been cut off from now on, which is worthy of praise from the society. However, Zhu is still not satisfied with the current achievements. Therefore, at the opening, he earnestly instructed: "In the future, this Ministry must not only seek unity in telecommunications policy, but also seek close contact between postal, telecommunications, air, and aviation, so that they become a whole transportation industry that helps each other, and then extend to other state-run industries to form a piece." This sincere spirit of cooperation coincides with the spirit of working together of President Wang.</p>
<p>(3) The Spirit of Reform: The telecommunications policy of our country is seriously affected by national disasters, damaged by natural and man-made disasters, and the system is bad, the organization is empty, and the personnel is chaotic. Therefore, in the past fifty years, no significant development has been seen. In the past two years, the Vice Minister of Transportation has led from above, and the telecommunications colleagues have worked hard below to thoroughly reform the social reputation and is improving day by day. The Minister is still worried about the instability of the post, so he has formulated accounting systems and management regulations. He is also worried about the backward technology, so he has adopted new communication machinery, and held long-distance telephone and international telephone calls in nine provinces. He has high-sighted and foresight, and without the spirit of great fearlessness, he can achieve this! Also, looking at the proposals of the members, most of them are important plans to reform telecommunications policy. Wisdom is born of Ming, and knowing shame is courageous. The transportation authorities and the members know the shortcomings of telecommunications policy, and are ashamed of the backwardness of telecommunications, so they can propose reform plans and shake up the spirit of reform. All our colleagues should share this purpose, hold the final determination and the greatest perseverance, endure the burden, unite with one heart and one mind, and go to the merits and decrees. There is nothing that cannot be achieved.</p>
<p>The Telecommunications Policy Conference has already closed, and the grand plans will be implemented in order to satisfy the expectations of the people of the country. The reporter was fortunate to attend the event, and specially wrote down what he saw, and respectfully introduced it. Is it also a pleasure for the society to hear?</p>
<h3 id="e288">Small Statistics of the Telecommunications Policy Conference <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>

<p>— Qinghua</p>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation recently convened the Telecommunications Policy Conference. It is said that there were more than 400 proposals, most of which were related to the internal reorganization and improvement of telecommunications policy. There were also many related to the use of telecommunications by the people. The reporter will now report to the readers in summary:</p>
<p>1. Maintain the current telegram price: At this conference, many proposals were based on the fact that postal and railway prices have been increased repeatedly in recent years, suggesting that the price of inter-provincial telegrams should also be moderately increased by two or three cents per word to compensate for the losses of telecommunications policy. However, after the Ministry of Transportation explained the reasons why it was not convenient to increase the price, it was finally resolved to maintain the current price. This shows the Ministry's painstaking efforts to facilitate the people and not increase the burden on the people!</p>
<p>2. Charge double the ordinary rate for urgent long-distance calls. The urgent long-distance calls were originally charged at three times the ordinary rate. Now, in order to reduce the burden on the caller, it has been resolved to change to double the ordinary rate. In the future, those who have urgent matters to make long-distance calls can make full use of urgent calls, because it costs not much more than ordinary calls, and the calls can be very fast.</p>
<p>3. Increase the business hours of long-distance telephone bureaus: Some long-distance telephone bureaus in various places have very short business hours every day due to sluggish business, which is inconvenient for merchants and the people. Now, in order to facilitate merchants and the people to transmit business information in the morning and evening, it is specifically resolved to order the telephone bureaus to extend their business hours according to the actual situation of the local area, so as to benefit the business.</p>
<p>4. Specially made social telegram envelope newspapers: Social telegrams are mostly for congratulating on happy events or mourning funerals. According to the habits of the Chinese people, happy events are often in red, and funerals are in white or blue. If the telegram envelope and incoming newspaper of social telegrams are specially made with a kind of artistic and printed in color, and used for telegrams about congratulations, the recipient will be more happy, and the business will be easier to develop. Therefore, this proposal has also been passed, and it is expected that it will be realized soon.</p>
<p>5. Install automatic machines in radio stations in Shanghai, Tianjin, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Guangdong, etc.: There are a lot of telegrams to and from the above five places. Although there are telegraph bureaus, land and sea lines, and radio artificial wireless machines that can communicate, the land and sea lines are sometimes blocked. If all the reports are handed over to the radio station for transmission, the radio station will be difficult to handle because it is artificial telegraphing. Therefore, it was resolved at the meeting to promptly install high-speed automatic transmitting and receiving machines in each station, so that they can undertake a huge amount of reporting. In the future, after the official installation and communication, telegrams to and from Shanghai, North China, and South China will be very fast.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned resolutions will be prepared and implemented by the Ministry of Transportation in the shortest possible time. Readers should not mistake them as having been implemented.</p>
<h3 id="e290">Hopes Following the Postal and Telecommunications Conference <a href="#e290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— Di You</p>
<p>The postal and telecommunications administration has been established for over fifty years, yet never before has a conference been convened to discuss improvement plans. Although the issue was touched upon during the Communications Conference in the seventeenth year of the Republic, its nature was not as specialized as this conference, and the proposals were not as numerous or substantial. Therefore, this conference marks a new record in the history of our nation's postal and telecommunications administration, and it is worthy of our commemoration, without a doubt.</p>
<p>The most emotionally stirring aspect of the conference was the arduous journeys undertaken by delegates from remote provinces, traveling great distances to attend. This not only proves that the previously fragmented postal and telecommunications administration has been restored to completeness, but also demonstrates that our nation is on the path to unification. However, amidst our joy and solace, everyone shares a painful sentiment—the absence of delegates from the four northeastern provinces! The postal and telecommunications administration of the four northeastern provinces, under Japanese control, has been transformed in ways unknown to us over the past three years. We hope that by the time of the next postal and telecommunications conference, the vast lost territories will have been recovered, and delegates from the Northeast will be able to attend. At that time, we will feel even greater genuine joy and solace. Therefore, I sincerely hope that all colleagues in the national postal and telecommunications administration will work together, diligently and tirelessly, under conditions of full cooperation, to shoulder our due responsibilities and jointly realize this great aspiration!</p>
<p>Secondly, since the founding of the Republic, the nation has faced many crises, and the postal and telecommunications administration has struggled precariously, constantly gasping for breath amidst hardship. It remains in dire straits today. The reason for this is naturally the decline in business, and the cause of the decline is the non-payment of fees for official military telegrams. According to statistics, official military telegram fees account for sixty percent of the national postal and telecommunications revenue. However, this majority percentage is merely a numerical representation; in reality, only one-tenth of these fees are actually collected in cash. The massive amount of official telegram fees owed from the era of the Beijing government need not be mentioned. Even since the establishment of the Nationalist Government in the seventeenth year of the Republic, the telegram fees owed by various military and political organizations amount to over twenty million yuan. How can the national postal and telecommunications agencies sustain themselves solely on the revenue from a small number of commercial telegrams? How can they avoid daily deterioration? The postal and telecommunications administration is now riddled with problems; without remedies, it will collapse beyond recovery. Currently, employees' salaries are in arrears and cannot be paid, shallow roads are neglected and cannot be repaired, and machinery is outdated and cannot be updated. Everything is truly unbearable to describe! In today's difficult circumstances for the government, it is understandable that political and military organizations cannot pay for telegrams, but many organizations have the means to pay in cash yet persist in the old habit of "never paying." If this mentality is not broken, the telecommunications industry will never find a solution.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Premier Wang's address clearly and thoroughly explained the situation with genuine sincerity, expressing the Executive Yuan's commitment to help. We are deeply grateful for this! We firmly believe that this wise leader will not only speak but also act, and will eradicate the aforementioned root causes one by one, allowing the postal and telecommunications administration to first achieve economic liberation, and then have the opportunity to improve and innovate. At the same time, we earnestly hope that all military and political authorities will abide by Premier Wang's wishes, understand the difficulties of the postal and telecommunications administration, and work together to promote the development of nationalized enterprises!</p>
<h3 id="e291">Reflections on the Closing of the Postal and Telecommunications Conference <a href="#e291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>The highly anticipated Postal and Telecommunications Conference concluded in the capital on the sixth of this month, amidst widespread attention. Given the crucial importance of postal and telecommunications to the nation and society, the people's expectations for the conference were particularly high. The conference's mission was limited to discussing reforms in postal and telecommunications; how to implement the resolutions is within the purview of the authorities and beyond the conference's intervention. However, considering the communications authorities' efforts in recent years to improve postal and telecommunications, as well as their spirit of focusing on practical action rather than empty talk, one can anticipate that the conference will produce positive results. The fact that this conference did not focus on superficial pomp but instead dedicated itself to technical discussions, abandoning the long-standing bureaucratic habits, further confirms my words.</p>
<p>The implementation of government policies relies on the diligent execution of orders by lower-level personnel, but it also depends on the leaders' ability to supervise effectively to ensure practical results. In our nation's political circles, the observance of government orders has often been neglected, leading to the unfortunate consequence that laws and regulations become mere formalities, with a strange disconnect between laws and reality. The reason for this is largely the lack of effective supervision by leaders, although textual ambiguities or practical obstacles can also be major factors hindering the implementation of policies. The convening of this Postal and Telecommunications Conference brought together top officials and heads of affiliated agencies, allowing each to share their experiences in open discussions. The intentions of policies from higher-level authorities and the implementation processes of lower-level agencies could all be candidly presented and discussed, which will undoubtedly contribute significantly to the implementation of policies.</p>
<p>Furthermore, due to the number of participants, this conference was limited to the heads of key postal and telecommunications agencies. However, lower-level personnel, recognizing the importance of the conference, also submitted opinions in writing, requesting that the conference make public decisions. Although the attendees, due to the limited time, were unable to conduct detailed research, they still considered the interests of lower-level personnel and submitted the issues for discussion. This is particularly worthy of our praise.</p>
<h3 id="e292">Anecdotes from the Postal and Telecommunications Conference <a href="#e292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>— Lao Tan</p>
<p>The Postal and Telecommunications Conference lasted three days. Some noteworthy events occurred, and I will briefly recount what I saw to leave a trace.</p>
<p>Speeches by Several Important Figures—During the opening ceremony on September 4th, Minister of Communications Zhu Jiahua's speech was extremely sincere and moving, while Vice Minister Zhang Daofan's address contained many thought-provoking remarks. However, Premier Wang Jingwei was late due to attending a meeting of the Executive Yuan. The members present that day eagerly awaited to hear Premier Wang's insights, and his speech was met with frequent applause. Premier Wang is known nationwide for his eloquence, and the attendees were all satisfied with his elucidation of various points regarding the Postal and Telecommunications Conference.</p>
<p>Reporting Numbers at the Conference—Members were assigned numbers based on their order of registration, and seats were assigned accordingly. According to conference rules, each speaker should first report their number before speaking. However, some forgot to report their number and spoke directly, so the chairman often said, "Please report your number first." The conference recorders, by first listening to the number, could also identify the speaker, which greatly facilitated recording.</p>
<p>Distributed Publications at the Conference—The publications distributed at the conference included those from the International Telecommunication Union and reports on the postal and telecommunications industry in Zhejiang Province. They were distributed according to the assigned numbers and contained excellent content. This publication was also distributed to each member for their perusal.</p>
<h3 id="e293">Autodial <a href="#e293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>— Dun</p>
<p>The British Post Office has recently developed a device to be installed in automatic telephone subscribers' homes, allowing them to connect to the most frequently called numbers by simply pressing a lever, eliminating the need to dial the telephone number and repeated dial errors. This device is called the Autodial. The outside is a small box with a "needle," a "key," and "number holes." To make a call, the subscriber first inserts the needle into the desired number hole and then presses the key. This device is available in two versions, one with a capacity of twenty-five numbers and the other with a capacity of fifty numbers. The quarterly rental fee is only six shillings and eight shillings, respectively.</p>

<h3 id="e294">Solemn Five Minutes <a href="#e294" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c294" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">294</a></h3>
<p>— Gong Pu</p>
<p>—Commemorating the Third Anniversary of the September 18th National Humiliation—</p>
<p>It is the third anniversary of "September 18th" again. National disasters are like family disasters, and the heads of families are always more deeply grieved than the children! Because as the head of a family, unless the family disaster is caused by unavoidable misfortunes, the head of the family bears a serious responsibility. On this day of heartache, the head of the family, seeing the scene, will naturally burst into tears, which is a common human emotion. The children, witnessing this tragic and mournful scene, have no intention of blaming past mistakes but only know to draw their swords and rise up, vowing to restore the family fortunes. This is as it should be. Otherwise, if everyone cries together, although it may be cathartic for a moment, when the tears are dry and the eyes are sore, facing each other blankly without any solutions, then the family will surely fall and the nation will surely perish.</p>
<p>The third anniversary of "September 18th" is a day of extreme national humiliation. Those in charge of national affairs have stipulated that on this day, "all banquets and entertainment nationwide shall cease, and party, government, military, police agencies, organizations, and schools in all localities shall hold commemorative gatherings. At 11:00 AM, work shall be suspended for five minutes, and everyone shall stand in silent contemplation, vowing to avenge the national humiliation, to express deep mourning." This shows how those in charge of national affairs are struggling for the nation, have not forgotten old hatreds, and want to use this day to cry for five minutes to release the grievances they have suffered as heads of families for the past few years. Their sadness and sorrow are deeply moving! But do the people, as children, still have the leisure at this time of national crisis to learn the lamentations of women and children, instead of becoming heroes drawing their swords to lead the nation forward?</p>
<p>Solemn commemorations cannot repel the enemy, and mere weeping is insufficient to restore the nation. During these five minutes of national silence, what should we silently contemplate in our minds?</p>
<p>First, we should thoroughly examine all the incorrect concepts and regrettable failures of the Chinese people's resistance to Japan since "September 18th," and recognize the true way forward.</p>
<p>Second, do not overlook the power of the people's resistance to Japan. The government should immediately engage in organizing the masses and forming a solid anti-Japanese front.</p>
<p>Third, we must prepare for self-defense, prepare for war against Japan, and prepare to recover lost territories with our own strength, opposing all imperialist activities of war within Chinese territory.</p>
<p>Fourth, we can no longer rely on anyone to fight our battles for us, and we must break the mentality of seeking temporary peace at any cost nationwide.</p>
<p>Fifth, we must eliminate the day of "September 18th," this extreme humiliation.</p>
<p>This year, we should not simply conclude matters with five minutes of sorrow, nor should we merely fulfill our national responsibilities with the above "conceptual" commemoration. I think that most of the readers of this publication, judging by their professional relationships, are merchants. I hope you can focus on boycotting Japanese goods for five minutes and act on it for a year.</p>
<p>We should restore the organizations that boycotted Japanese goods after September 18th, re-inspect Japanese goods, prohibit the sale of Japanese goods, and thoroughly investigate merchants who smuggle Japanese goods, change the trademarks of Japanese goods, and pass them off as domestic products. We should form an investigative network, densely distributed in various industries, to expose the conspiracies of traitors with the power of the masses. This is one way for our shop assistants and apprentices to draw their swords and become pioneers for the nation after these solemn five minutes.</p>
<p>We should all use our special social positions to commemorate "September 18th" with actions, and no longer simply "weep."</p>

<h3 id="e295">The Future of Germany's Political Situation <a href="#e295" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c295" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">295</a></h3>
<p>— Yong De</p>
<p>—Domestic Political, Economic, and Diplomatic Difficulties—</p>
<p>We still remember last July 13, when Hitler reported to the National Socialist Party members in the Reichstag about the ins and outs of various Second Revolution conspiracy incidents, and received unanimous approval from all party members who shouted "Long live Hitler!" Since then, the foundation of Hitler's regime has become increasingly solid. At the same time, party members who were related to the Second Revolution conspiracy incidents were exiled, and close confidants were brought in, and this continues to this day.</p>
<p>Recently, President Hindenburg passed away. From an objective point of view, what will become of Hitler's regime in the future? Before raising this question, we must first recognize the important factors that can restrain the fate of Hitler's regime and the trends of various domestic political factors. There is an elite 100,000-man national defense force in Germany, and this 100,000-man national defense force has not yet been incited by the National Socialist Party's propaganda. They still maintain an independent position. This is a very obvious fact. The Sturmabteilung, known as Hitler's private army, has more than two million people and possesses great power, but it is now the only cancer of the National Socialist Party regime. In such a situation, what is the ultimate solution? Force the dissolution of the Sturmabteilung? Or completely reorganize the national defense force? This is the first major domestic political problem.</p>
<p>The second is the trend of public sentiment. The German masses are currently silent, like hibernating animals, but this cannot last forever. All freedom of speech and action is suppressed under authoritarian and dictatorial politics, and most of the masses do not trust the National Socialist Party regime at all. At the same time, there are many organizations of various opposition parties, and their ideas have deeply penetrated the people. On the other hand, power struggles and differences in political opinions among the National Socialist Party cadres make the future of the National Socialist Party regime, especially Hitler's regime, and its dictatorial rule, truly fraught with difficulties!</p>
<p>Third, there is the economic problem, which is closely related to domestic political issues. In terms of foreign trade, due to the increase in the value of the mark and the National Socialist Party government's xenophobic and self-sufficient trade policies, an anti-German sentiment has been aroused in various countries. Therefore, foreign trade has become increasingly sluggish recently. From January to May of this year, the import surplus reached 178 million marks. Comparing this figure with the export surplus of 263 million marks in the same period last year, the difference is clear. According to government announcements, the number of unemployed people has decreased by more than two million since Hitler came to power. On the surface, this must be said to be Hitler's achievement. But what is the actual situation? Although the number of unemployed people has decreased, the wages of all workers have sharply decreased. Therefore, although the number of unemployed workers has decreased, the total wages have instead decreased. In this contradictory situation, the workers are becoming increasingly impoverished. In addition, the soaring prices of necessities of life make it impossible for all the laboring classes to maintain their families, and they cannot even take care of their personal lives. In this way, the people's faith in Hitler's regime has become even more indifferent.</p>
<p>Finally, we must discuss the crisis in Germany's diplomatic relations. Since Germany withdrew from the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference, it has become even more isolated in the international arena. In June of this year, Hitler's meeting with Mussolini was intended to promote friendly relations between Germany and Italy, and for a time there were rumors that Germany would break away from its isolated position and gain a powerful supporter. However, shortly after the two leaders met, the Austrian National Socialist Party assassinated Dollfuss in a rebellion. Respect for Austrian independence was the fundamental condition for friendly relations between Germany and Italy, and therefore, the Austrian coup event has led to an increasingly confrontational situation between Germany and Italy. This incident not only intensified the conflict between Germany and Italy, but also deepened the suspicion and antipathy of other countries toward Germany. The future diplomatic situation of Germany will become even more isolated, and this is undeniable.</p>
<p>When we examine Germany's domestic political problems, economic problems, and diplomatic problems, any element of any problem contains a major crisis. The National Socialist Party regime will be the tinderbox of a world war. In the past, Hitler said, "The National Socialist Party's world can continue for tens of millions of years!" But when we look at the situation described above, we dare not easily believe this statement!</p>

<h3 id="e296">Father-Son Conflict <a href="#e296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>— Hui Qing</p>
<p>As long as contradictions among people have not been fundamentally eliminated, father-son conflicts will exist in every era. In China today, at a time when all contradictions are intensifying, these father-son conflicts are particularly widespread and acute. As long as we pay a little attention to the current social conditions and family phenomena in China, we can find examples of father-son conflicts everywhere. Fathers want to uphold traditional morality, but sons want to talk about modern fashion; fathers want stability, but sons want to be bold and decisive; fathers want conservatism, but sons want progress… Are not all these very common phenomena in Chinese society today?</p>
<p>However, how do these father-son conflicts arise? Volovsky, in his critique of Turgenev's "Fathers and Sons," said: "The two eras opposed to each other in Turgenev's novel are separated because they are, rather than one being the 'father' and the other the 'son,' representatives of two different social states that initially began the conflict. The roles of 'father' and 'son' only serve to sharpen the antagonistic relationship between two things." This is absolutely correct. Father-son conflict is not simply a father-son conflict, but the expression of the contradictions between two eras or two societies. Volovsky's statement is not only a correct comment on Turgenev's "Fathers and Sons," but also very suitable for critiquing the current phenomenon of father-son conflict in China.</p>
<p>Although the current situation in China is very complex, its main contradiction is expressed in the opposition between the old and new worlds, eras, or societies. Obviously, some people today have accepted an established traditional worldview in their life process, so they affirm reality and shake their heads at all the changes and new phenomena that arise from real life, considering them incredible. Conversely, other people, in their real life, under the constant stimulation of all the new changes produced by reality, are forced to embrace new "biases," deny established traditions, and stubbornly move forward on new paths. In addition to these, there are of course some people who live in between, or partially lean towards the former or the latter, but these people cannot exist independently and therefore cannot transcend the contradictions between the old and new worlds. Thus, the contradictions in Chinese society today are mainly the contradictions between the old and new worlds, eras, or societies. The so-called father-son conflict is mainly a reflection of this contradiction.</p>
<p>Of course, I am not saying that the contradictions between the old and new eras or societies are not expressed in any other situations besides father-son conflicts. No, I am not so foolish! I understand that the conflict between the old and the new is even more obvious in the struggles of the masses than in the father-son conflict; moreover, the father-son conflict can only be correctly explained in the struggles of the masses. However, when we discuss father-son conflict, saying that this conflict is mainly an expression of the contradictions between the old and new worldviews, saying that it is an expression of the contradictions between the old and new eras or societies, I am afraid there is nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>Father-son conflict is, of course, the most unfortunate in the eyes of those moralists. Therefore, recently some people have followed these gentlemen's intentions and advocated resolving this problem as soon as possible. How to resolve it? They say: "There is no other way except for the father to yield to the son, or the son to yield to the father." However, the problem is not as simple as people think, and it cannot be solved by simply using two words.</p>
<p>We already know that father-son conflict mainly represents the contradiction between the old and new worldviews. If this contradiction cannot "yield" to each other, then the father-son conflict expressing this contradiction can absolutely not be resolved by "yielding." However, facts tell us that, throughout history, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, the conflict between the old and new worlds has never been resolved by "yielding." The contradictions between the old and new forces in every era and every society are resolved in those contradictions. Specifically, they are resolved in the development process of the contradictions, due to the negation of the old forces by the new forces. Therefore, the father-son conflict, which mainly expresses the contradictions between the old and new worlds, eras, or societies, must be resolved in the development of this conflict. Those who want to alleviate this conflict by "yielding" will not have any significance other than expressing their fear of this conflict and attempting to hinder the evolution of human society promoted by this conflict.</p>
<p>The same is true when the problem is shifted to the current China. If father-son conflict is developing in China today, then this problem will inevitably be resolved in this development; moreover, this resolution will promote the progress of human society. If we are not afraid of progress, then there is no need to worry about this father-son conflict, and even less need to sing the praises of "yielding," calling for the son to "yield" to the father, or calling for the father to "yield" to the son.</p>

<h3 id="e297">Customs Inspector <a href="#e297" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c297" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">297</a></h3>
<p>— Ru Yue</p>
<p>Because of the oppression of family finances and the panic of unemployment, I had to abandon the innocent and pure heart of my middle school days and desperately squeeze into this turbid society to find a job and solve the problem of making a living. I spent a lot of effort begging teachers, friends, and relatives to introduce and recommend me, and finally managed to get a position as an inspector in a customs inspection bureau hundreds of miles away from home, earning a salary of fifteen yuan a month.</p>
<p>The Customs Inspection Bureau is located in a prosperous county in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Upstream, it can reach Chongqing, and downstream, it can reach Yichang and Hankou. Merchant ships come and go every day. My job is to squat at the wharf, wait for the ships to arrive, and check whether there are smugglers carrying contraband and unscrupulous merchants who sell goods without paying taxes, or passengers and students carrying reactionary books.</p>
<p>The inspection work is easier when encountering ships going upstream than those going downstream, because the upstream ships have at least passed through one or two inspection agencies before reaching here, and we only need to search casually. However, ships going downstream to us are considered the first checkpoint (for example, ships departing from Chongqing have only undergone a very perfunctory inspection before raising anchor there), so our work is more troublesome and arduous. Firstly, because this place is a well-known export port for Sichuan soil and morphine, in order to evade taxes and seek advantages, merchants often smuggle goods out of Sichuan. Secondly, because the exchange rate for silver out of Sichuan province often requires a surcharge of about twenty or thirty yuan per hundred yuan, ordinary small merchants and students studying abroad like to carry cash (the outflow of cash is strictly prohibited by the provincial government). There is also the smuggling of Sichuan salt. Our inspection target is focused on opium, cash, and Sichuan salt. In recent years of economic panic and heavy taxes, almost everyone on the downstream ships, including some passengers, stewards, sailors, and cooks, likes to secretly carry some of these three things. Because there are too many of these villains, the inspection agencies have also become stricter, but no matter how strict you are, these criminals have never disappeared. The more strictly you inspect, the more ingenious and secret their methods of smuggling private goods become, and the more effort it takes to inspect. For example, take their hiding opium as an example. Some passengers make the luggage basket into a double-layered bottom, filling the empty frame between the two layers, which is two or three inches high, with opium. Even more ingenious is to use three or two small bamboo sticks, hollowing out the joints inside, rubbing the opium into noodles, inserting it into the bamboo, and then twisting the bamboo into the handle of the basket. Some also paste opium paste on the hanging axis of couplet calligraphy to blend in. The ones that are more ridiculous and ingenious than the previous ones are those who use pig urine bags to pack opium and hang them in the crotches of their pants inside menstrual belts on winter ships. There are too many things like this to tell. Because of their peculiar behavior, we have to work harder to discover their secrets. Therefore, as soon as the ship docks, we rush up like hunting dogs chasing wild rabbits, searching through boxes and baskets, carefully looking at every corner and every piece of luggage. When we encounter a basket, we have to poke it to the bottom with a wire, then take it out, smell it with our nose, and taste it with our mouth. We even have to ask everyone on the ship to take off their clothes for a search. Sometimes, when we see someone with a suspicious attitude, we have to feel her crotch to see if there is a pig urine bag containing opium or a fake menstrual belt there.</p>
<p>This tedious and painful work is of course despised and cursed, but since I have already eaten this bowl of rice, what else can I do if I don’t do this work that is despised and cursed? Moreover, according to the regulations of the bureau, every inspector must report at least one achievement per month (inspecting a batch of smuggled goods). If no achievement is reported for two consecutive months, there is a risk of losing the job. Because of this situation, how can I not endure the pain and fiercely</p>
<p>Continued on page five</p>

<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>search people, extort people, and cause people to hate me!</p>
<p>I remember one winter, I didn't have any results for six consecutive weeks. The superiors thought that I had been bribed by merchants, passengers, and stewards, and gradually became dissatisfied with me. I realized this situation and became very anxious. Later, when a ship arrived, no matter who it was, I would ask them to take off their clothes for me to search. This time, I happened to encounter a middle-aged woman in steerage who was both cunning and vicious. When she took off her clothes for me to feel her purse, I don't know why my hand was a little too heavy and touched her body. She immediately slapped me a few times, followed by a few mouthfuls of saliva, and scolded me for deliberately pinching her breasts. But her saliva spat on my face, and the slaps hurt my heart. How should I seek justice? "Mountains don't fight with water, men don't fight with women." Should I fight back? Absolutely not. Finally, with a painful heart, I gently walked away amidst the laughter and sarcasm of the crowd.</p>
<p>People say: Customs Bureau inspectors have low salaries, but they are the most profitable positions. But I only feel that such inspectors are hateful and pitiful people in the world!</p>
<p>Naturally, under the pressure of superiors to do evil, and in the midst of a depressed and painful life, we are honed into a fierce nature and corrupt behavior. Isn't it true that, for example, when performing inspection duties, if anyone does not quickly open their boxes for us to see, or deliberately makes things difficult for us, then we will fiercely scold them, or even push them and kick them. In order to have achievements to report, and under the conditions of keeping our jobs and hoping for a salary increase, we often make an issue of things, and nitpick to seize small or even just suspicious items to punish passengers and detain stewards, etc. Speaking of corruption, when salaries are not paid for two or three months, in order to give gifts, entertain guests, etc., for our own depression and need for entertainment (naturally, we often have to play cards, drink alcohol, and visit prostitutes for recreation), or because the wives and children at home are waiting for money to be sent home for food and clothing, how can you not take the opportunity to extort, or openly let go and secretly accept bribes from smugglers to earn some "extra money"? Relying entirely on the salary? What is fifteen yuan enough for?</p>
<p>As for the noble and special passengers and their "precious family members," the inspectors have no way and no power to perform their inspection duties, although sometimes the contraband they carry may be hundreds of times more than that of ordinary passengers. If the inspector unwittingly disturbs the good dreams of those "precious family members," or even unintentionally finds something and "makes a scene" in public, then not only will your job be "taken away with a splash," but you will also become some kind of criminal.</p>
