<p>日本在東北四省境內建築繁密之交通網。汽車道路。巳次第完成。鐵道更積極進行用意固在於軍事。而經濟政治。亦相輔爲用。其侵略手段之勇猛。實迫我國民不能再作旦夕苟安之想。茲先就朝陽到熱河承德一綫言之本年五月下旬。滿鐵總裁林愽太郎。偕同該公司理事與工程師數人赴熱境視察朝熱綫路基。謂將於八月間完成該路。九十月間卽實行通車。就表面觀察。此舉似無重大作用。其實則意在扼制經濟。甚爲明顯也。熱河境內多山。交通不便。人所共知。僅有一汽車路綫。在經濟上尙無多大價値。欲持此以開發熱河。殊不能。蓋礦產之發展。與羊毛皮革之輸運。均非有任重致遠之工具不可。而日本輕工業之發逹。已增高度。彼卽不產棉花。又不生羊毛。原料仰給於人。一旦發生國際戰爭。卽將處於劣敗地位。是以日夜籌劃。思所以取得繊維原料之產生地。毛質又佳。安得而不急謀開發耶。以目前形勢論。日本在東北。空中有飛機。陸地有汽車路。以地方未間人烟稀少之熱河。有此種交通工具。似已足用。然而汽車不能載運笨重貨品。如羊毛礦產等。卽能勉强載運。而運費太昂。殊不合乎公算。且日本國內||臺灣及庫頁島均在內|。其出產石油最多時代。年不過四十萬三千噸。去年出產。僅祇二十五萬噸左右而現所需。年約四百萬噸其餘三百萬噸之石油。皆由海外輸入。一日輸入杜絶其一切活動。卽有頓告停止之慮。故晶本寗願使用比較笨重之工具。经圖其運用上之便利。鐵道雖與最新交通相较速率固不及。但能任重致遠且又不易爲外力所破毁。或爲自然阻力所制。故日人急急進行建築此路也。</p>
<p>其問最堪注意者。卽當地經濟組織之控制是也。飛機汽車。旣不能爲實際的經濟控制。自不得不着重於鐵道。如最近滿鐵沿綫及東北其他各綫。爲滿鐵所牽制者。對當地之農產物品。皆加重其運費。使之不能向外流通。致豆類及其他榖物。價格愈見低落。促成農業衰頽。以便於彼之剝削。同時對日本工業製造品。則可肅量輸運。以排擠當地僅有之工業。現在東北三省經濟。已呻吟於此種苦况之下而不易自援。朝熱鐵路成。亦必將爲之續矣。日人之侵略政策。决不僅限於經濟。固爲世人所共見。彼在政治上所謂大陸政策。且將更進而西伺察綏。南窺河北亦爲國人所同慮。在熱河鐵道未成之前彼雖有形勢之便。然其用兵之困難。亦與我同。察綏境內/荒漠千里/在以往情形。我猶可以運用其拙力。奮我民族之血誠。勉與應戰。但彼於年餘時期中。竟已衝過山林險阻之難關。以佈置其積極政策。使我國在彼鐵蹄下之人民。無一喘息之餘地。在經濟上旣惟有聽其共剝削。軍事上更慮於被動地位。矧　東境內。騒亂未息。我國軍警。卽不能自由行使其職權。處處受人制限。并故意使此種狀態延長。以便其策略之運用。料熱河鐵道完成以後。彼可借口之事實愈多。而兵隊之運送。愈爲便利。　東之困難。勢必日益加甚。接近熱境之察哈爾。更當其衝。隨時有被侵之慮。吾國人對此重大威。脅將何以自善其後也。</p>

<p>（東京）蘇俄大使今晨訪外相廣田、商修正盧布與日金匯率談判事、並討論黑龍江滿船三艘爲蘇俄防兵射擊案、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）日俄兩國今以「滿洲國」船隻前在黑龍江攝影被蘇俄防兵射擊、交換照會、局勢又趨惡化、蘇俄提出嚴重警吿、以答　日本之抗議、稱「滿洲國」船隻應立卽停止偵察蘇俄邊境、否則應自尸其咎云、此項警吿、上星期卽巳遞交哈爾濱之日本外交代表、惟至昨夜始正式公佈、此項警吿原係答復日本抗議、日本在其抗議文中反對蘇俄防兵射擊「滿洲國」船隻、死傷兩人、蘇俄政府反駁稱、防軍開槍、意在警吿、並未直接轟擊船隻、「滿洲國船」上二人、係受「滿洲國」邊內土匪攻擊、且根據國際法、如警吿不生効力蘇俄防軍自有合法權力向「滿洲國」船隻開槍云、兩國爲和平計、現擬組織一委員會調查此事、（四日國民電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）此間巳公佈塔斯社之消息如下、蘇聯外交人民委員會關於滿方駐哈副交涉員島村向蘇聯總領斯拉夫茲基所作之抗議、特於六月一日訓令斯氏通知島村如下、五月二十四日予已通知閣下、依據遵照中央當局訓令執行調查之結果、證明「迪城」輪事件之發生乃由該輪非法靠近蘇聯岸邊、且對各岸防重地伯有系統之攝影、以及該輪不顧岸上之一再警吿、繼續迫近蘇聯向前駛行所致、余在答覆閣下五月二十八日之質詢時、應正吿閣下、卽莫斯科中央續接報吿巳充分證實上述調查之結果、</p>
<p>至就該問題之法理部份而言、根據國際公法一般原則、黑龍江旣爲邊界、則鄰近兩國在其國界綫與該團河岸間之河叚均有應用其法律及規則之權利、根據一九二七年六月十五日蘇聯所頒關於邊境國防之法令、以及一九二七年共和國法規第六十二號六二五欵之規定、黑龍江邊衛署對此非法而長時間靠近蘇聯邊岸、同時不斷攝取蘇聯岸境特别爲邊卒崗站之「迪城」輪船、自有令其停駛之權力、遵照一九二九年二月二十三日頒佈之蘇俄社會主義聯邦共和國法律第二條之規定、不得特准禁止在邊境攝影、根據一九二七年六月十五日所頒、上述法律第三十五條之規定、該輪旣有非法行動、則「於施放空槍一響、及實彈槍二響、以爲警吿後、」邊卒已有運用其武器之充分權力、唯蘇聯邊卒服從其長官關於除絶對必要外須避免任何得與鄰國引起糾紛之行動之訓令、並未運用上述條欵所賦予之權力卽自日本軍官瀧君船長於五月二十六日在哈爾濱日日報上所發表之消息、（瀧君於事變發生時乃在迪城輪船上）亦已表明聯邊卒對此迫近蘇岸之輪船、巳一再大聲呼喊與放空槍作爲信號該輪直至船員表示其完全無心注意邊卒之信號、以及向該輪烟囱之上向上放實彈數發以後最後始行駛離蘇聯岸邊、而向滿岸駛去、</p>
<p>當調查之際、全部邊卒均提供彼等之實證、證明邊卒之中絶無一人直接向該輪放槍者、至於閣下所稱迪城輪上曾死一人傷一人云云予謂閣下必須注意下述事實、卽根據五月二十二日日本太田大使向副外委長斯托夢尼亞科夫所作聲明迪城輪之駛近蘇聯邊岸、乃因滿岸有匪類向該輪射擊所致、同時五月十八日黑河地方所出黑河民報揭露之消息、亦得證實上述之聲明、該報稱、該輪於離松花江與黑龍江合流處二十五維爾斯脫每維爾斯脫合一·○六七公里）、並在滿洲村落土西覬附近之松花江上、爲匪類槍擊、結果死船員二人、該輪自五月十二日於畢莊河區域與蘇聯邊卒發生事端後、始行上溯黑龍江駛至黑河、故黑河報所稱匪類射擊事件、顯然發生於迪城號與蘇聯邊卒事件之前、而所謂與蘇聯邊卒之事件、實卽爲太田大使所稱述之槍擊事件耳由此等事實所得之結論、卽閣下在根據迪城輪船長之報吿而發表之聲明中所稱、死傷各一人云云實非蘇聯邊卒射擊之結果、而正如黑河報紙所傳之爲匪類槍擊之犠牲品也、唯滿洲方面如有新鮮材料、則蘇聯方面絶不拒絶續派人員澈底調查此事、</p>
<p>蘇聯邊卒與滿洲輪船三艘所發生之事件、均係該輪等非法行動之結果、例如破越蘇聯邊界及對蘇聯邊卒崗站作系統之攝影是、同時又爲彼等絶對不願顧及蘇聯岸卒在歴次事件所與信號與警吿之結果、蘇聯政府對此實深遺慽、蘇聯政府因此類事件有損於兩鄰國間之交誼故以爲雙方應採一切可能步驟、以令此類事件將來不再發生、上述三項滿輪事件雖純係彼等衝破蘇聯邊界以及彼等於蘇聯河岸附近之非法行動之結果、唯蘇聯巳重行嚴令邊地機關、審愼並嚴格遵從法律、並令非至萬不得已不得運用武器、同時蘇聯政府已注意此項事實、卽爲令滿輪在蘇聯領水內之事件不再發生計、滿洲當局應先堅决設法嚴令懸掛滿國國旗之輪船不得破越蘇聯邊界、其在蘇聯領水內、並須尊重蘇聯法律與規則、蘇聯政府希望來日黑龍江航行機關與滿洲航行組織關於黑龍江航行技術問題之談判、亦能促成並保證黑龍江上航行之正常狀况、並在雙方領水上能尊重雙　方之法律與規則云、（三日塔斯電）</p>

<p>(續)千家駒</p>
<p>說到湖南人、令我們想起了李季在我的生平上所說的「湖南驢子」那句話來、眞的、湖南人那種堅忍不拔的毅力與勤儉刻苦的精神、是爲那一省人所不及的、最可異的就是柳州與桂林的織土布者、差不多完全是湖南佬、柳州織土布的還不多、桂林却有數千戶、他們都集中在幾個區域內、這幾個區域事實上、就是湖南人的殖民區、每一家少的有三二架織機、多的有十數架、這種織機完全是木製的手織機、他們用脚在底下踏、用手在上面穿梭、祇要每一天早五六點鐘起來、我們就會聽見他們ＣｈｅＴａｉｃｈｅＴａｉ的織機聲、一直到了晚上十一二點鐘、這種ＣｈｅＴａｉＣｈｅＴａｉ的聲音、還不會停歇、要說起工作時間來、每天至少也要在十五六點以上、但他們天能賺多少錢呢據紡織工會的人對我們說、「他們的工資都論件計、每織十丈長的布一疋、給工錢三吊二、五丈長的布一疋、給資一吊六、當以前銅元的價格高時、三吊二約合一元、一吊六合洋五毫、工友自晨六時織至夜十二時、約可得長五丈之布一疋、但自銅元跌價後（桂林一帶因湖南劣銅元輸入、價格日跌、小商人及手工業者無不大受損失、呌苦運天、）每毫銀值四十九個銅元、一吊六不過合三毫多錢、工人以生活艱於維持、由織布工會提出、擬請僱主改以毫洋爲工資單位、但僱方堅持不允、雙方爭持不日、後將這案提交縣政府也不能解决、復交工會與商會自行調解、終於没有結果、然僱主方面、這時却乘機把機布公會的五個執行委員全行革除、並且議决任何一家不許雇用、工人以生計無着、卒至失敗、現在再也没有人敢當執行會員、織布公會因之停頓、這問題也不解决而解决了、這一段話、不但表明了舊式的小手工業主怎様的剝削工人、雖然雇主與雇工、同是湖南佬、然而他們利害的衝突、却並不因省界而泯滅、*</p>
<p>另一方面還可以說明自資本主義商品（洋布棉織物）侵入中國固內地後、中國固有的手工業所賴*</p>
<p>以存在的悲慘形態、桂林、賴他交通的不發逹、與運輸的困難、國外廉價商品的輸入、要經過人*</p>
<p>力的運輸與苛重的稅捐、所以土布業才能苟延殘喘、然而僅這「一息尙存」的運命、還是靠着對*</p>
<p>勞種力慘酷地剝削才能維持的呵、</p>
<p>桂林的商業、近幾年來、也是很不景氣的、這主要的原因、當然還是農村之破產、因而使農民購*買力薄弱、至於農村金融、則柳州同様的枯竭、譬如以借貸來說、借錢還息榖的習惯非常普*</p>
<p>買力薄弱、至於農村金融、則與柳州同樣的枯竭、　如以借貸來説、借錢還息榖的習慣非常普遍、農家借錢一吊、除還本外、加利榖三斤、這是桂林最通行的利率、一吊錢不過合二毛、三斤榖*</p>
<p>要值一毛二分、普通都在播種時（二·三月）借、收穫時（七·八月）還、爲期僅五六月、約合月息十*</p>
<p>分、桂　林廣西銀行、現雖在試辦農村放欵、東南西北四鄉指定四個代理人、農民借欵、可向代理人*　請求、由代理人向銀行通融、每戶借額、不得過一百元、月息一五分厘、內五厘提充代理人酬勞、*</p>
<p>請求、由代理人向銀行通融、每户借額、不得過一百元、月息一分五厘、内五厘提充代理人酬勞銀行實得一分、惟農家之信用如何、能償還否、概惟代理人是問、這種通融農村金融的用意、誠*</p>
<p>然是值得我們的欽偑、但影響如何、却是另一個問題了、因爲向銀行借欵的乎續太繁重了、能得*</p>
<p>到代理之信任的農民（代理人多爲當地之地主或士紳）、在鄉間是不多覩的、銀行雖有這番美*</p>
<p>意、其如貧農多不能受實惠何、我曾不止一次將廣西銀行農村放欵的事、詢問各鄉村的村長、他*</p>
<p>們甚至大多數根本不知道有這回事情、關於廣西銀行的農村放欵、良豐（離桂林四十里地）師範*</p>
<p>專科學校農業經濟的敎員蒒慕橋先生、說過幾句值　得我們哈咪的話、「要靠銀行的放欵來救濟*</p>
<p>農村是笑話的、因爲數目太少、則農民受不到　實惠、如桂林銀行的農村欵、我們就根本没有聽*</p>
<p>說過其爲無甚影響、可不待言、要有眞實的救濟、非有大量的資金不可、但試問廣西銀行的資*</p>
<p>金、是那兒來的呢、票不是由所謂田賦附加契稅附加、······籌集而得、先由農民拿出來、回頭又*</p>
<p>以這錢放欵給他們、如此救濟、寗非滑稽、」</p>
<p>這裏我附帶的介紹一下廣西師範專科學校、校址設於離桂林四十里路之良豐公園、良豐乃*</p>
<p>村名、通公路、約一小時可逹、據聞該公園爲清末豪紳唐子實所有、這豪紳當平定洪楊時、曾建*</p>
<p>立殊勛、不肯出仕、寗願在桂林做個土覇王、該公園就是他那勢力炙乎時徴發民伕利用無償勞*</p>
<p>動所與築的、迨至民國、他的子孫、很没出息、就廉價售給岑春暄、自岑春暄倒霉後、又收回作爲*</p>
<p>公園、現問作師專的校址、這的確是風景幽美、四團環境遠靜的一個所在、該校校長楊東蓴先*</p>
<p>生、亦是位實心治事、學識豐富的學者、師專的使命、據該校當局說、乃「爲鄉村師範而設、鄉村*</p>
<p>師範又爲鄉村敎育而設」、所以他們所注重的是怎様養成鄉村、師範的師資、所敎的課程、大都*</p>
<p>是興農村生產有關係的、同時他們更注意農村經濟問題、也曾舉行過幾次小規模的調查、調查*</p>
<p>中所着重的便是土所有關係、師專的學生、大都來自田間、聽說有許多且曾當過小學校長的、*</p>
<p>所以農村的生活、他們不但身親目擊、而且是自已體騐過來的人、這時能敎以正確的思考方法、*</p>
<p>灌注以科學的農業知識、不事半功倍、且也改良廣西農村的一綫曙光呢、</p>
<p>「到桂林而不一遊名山、正如過屠門而不大嚼一様、有一位朋友對我們水這様說、但所謂「桂林山*</p>

<h3 id="c219">（甲）今後的讀書問答 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>一·過去工作的檢討、　　當我們檢討這過去幾個月中的讀書問答工作的時候，我們發見了幾個缺點，這些缺點，爲了增進今後的工作，使工作更適合廣大讀者的要求，更趨際實際、實有指出之必要。</p>
<p>（一）我們創設書問答的目的，原爲帮助一般青年失學的讀者自修，但這幾個月來，顯明的，我們巳提出的問題，巳日趨專門化，並非普通店員學徒所能理解，以致實際上，能讀懂讀書問答的，還是少數的文化凖較高的讀者，我們的工作，要逹到普遍化，相差實在還有很大的距離。</p>
<p>（二）因我們提出的問題，日趨專門化，所以在文字上，也還沒有做到通俗化的一點。在讀書問答內，雖在空空靈寫作者盡了枝巧上的最大力量，但許多專門術語，仍不免充滿於字裏行間。這情形往往有嚇退一班理解力薄弱的讀者，不敢向我們提出問題的趨勢。</p>
<p>（三）我們過去的讀書問答，固然曾注重一般讀書方法的討論，但我們的方法却不能從小處下乎，往往採取範圍極大的題目，概括地加以敘述，這在寫作者，旣很費力，而在讀者對於問題，最多只能得到一個糢糊的印象。</p>
<p>（四）我們所涉及的問題的範圍，喝雖然並不囿於那一面，但我們却確乎忽視了許多爲大衆所急需了解的問題如商業識等等，以致收效於某一部份讀者而放棄了其他部份的讀者。</p>
<p>二、今後工作的方針</p>
<p>今後，我們要使我們的工作，更能進到通俗化普遍化的新階叚，我們價不能不用極大的力量，紏正如上所述的缺點，從新决定我們工作的態度和方針。</p>
<p>（一）擴大讀書問答範圍，詳細檢討書與生活的一切問題。</p>
<p>（二）極力减少提出高深的專門問題。</p>
<p>（三）文字力求通俗，極力避免專門術語的使用。</p>
<p>（四）取材以大處着眼小處下手爲原則。</p>
<p>（五）凡是批評一本書，保守極公正，和客觀的態度，以使讀者能明白該書的好壤所在爲限度。</p>
<p>（六）把提出討論的問題的範圍，盡可能實際化，具體化，要做到一般大衆共同的需要及了解的能力，不畏麻煩的一一論及。</p>
<p>三、今後「問答」內容</p>
<p>所以，對於我們今後「問答」內容，客觀上要求的是；</p>
<p>（一）舊小說的普遍檢查。（二）常識錯誤的糾正。（三）初步社會科學讀物的檢查。（四）普遍地對影響大衆的權威的著作的檢查。（五）自然科學的介紹。（六）商業常識。（七）對於某一學科研究的方法的討論。（八）對於一般讀書方法的討論。（九）對於讀書生活，各項實除際問題的討論。（十）雜誌報紙上重要問題的討論。（十）（一）關於語言文的解釋（乙）</p>

<p>我們收到外面的來信巳是整千件了。因爲來信的用紙都是由通訊者自已備置的，故信紙信封人各不同，有的用洋紙，有的用本紙，形形色色，五花八門，如果把它彙集起來，簡直可以開一個信封信箋展覽會。最近有幾位讀者竟用大紅紙或草紙寫信，字跡糢糊，不能卒讀，使我們看信白費了許多時光與精力。這還不去管它。最麻煩的是保存了，讀者的來信我們都是用袋子裝好保存起來，以便時常查考，但如果大小不一律，摺　裝袋就很麻煩。因此爲整齊便利及節省時間計，我們總希望讀者能用一律的信封信箋。現在我們預備印出一種通訊用紙，供讀者通訊之用，這様，以後通訊雙方就都很便利了。爲了顧到讀者的經濟負担起見，我們擬預備作一次多印幾萬，價目要定得低，比任何紙店還要便宜，我們只收極低成本出售，式様也求合用與美觀。大概在七月中旬趕快印好，屈時當另作通知。現在預定從八月一日起，我們一律用這類信箋信封。</p>

<p>至學習引水人以學習六個月爲期滿、經過必要的考試、卽成爲領照之引水人而取得前人之股份、若該繼承引水不能交納現欵以購買股份時、則向由當地銀行樂爲墊欵購取、唯自晚近該公會（譯者按此指上海外人引水公會）之法定地位欠穩固、故銀行家已不顧再出此途、儘管該公司之資產足以作此必要之擔保而有餘、</p>
<p>該公會現有之四十引水會員、其國籍之分配如次、法四·德二·丹麥二·美四·挪威二·荷蘭一·義大利一·日四·英十八·中國二·</p>
<p>現在中國之提議、乃將來除中國公民以外不得發给執照、不過須知外人於此初亦不能許爲引水學員、若非渠能得有勝任船長之文憑、或其他相等之文書並能證明至少已曾實任船長一年、及得有引水、董事會所指定醫師團之體格健全證書、</p>
<p>反之、中國考選引水學員、則一委之於港務長、商承管理會以審定各中國候補人、之航海資格、而决定其是否適於爲引水學員之職務、於此可以明白的說、是任何中國人、决不能與外人有同様資格的、</p>
<p>至此、吾人希望已經說明、中國政府若將現有之引水董事會、（該會由代表領事、外國總商會代表、港務長及上海领領有營業執照引水人公會之經理組成、）廢除、而以由海關巡上司·港務長參謀部代表·海軍部代表·交通部代表·中國總商會代表、外國總商會代表·等組成之一新委員會者代之、則對於條約義務不能不有所破壞、且此種企圖、將引起若干重要間題、今試詳述其一二如次、</p>
<p>第一照一九三二度引水總計、其進出口之三千四百萬噸船舶中、國只佔有六百三十萬噸、是外籍船舶之進出口、乃佔總噸數百分之八十一、因此可以略見外人利益於此所關之鉅、</p>
<p>除去橫渡大西洋之艨艟巨艦外、各式船舶、今日均路出上海、（卽四二·○○○噸之列顚皇后號、亦曾環遊世界、道經吳淞）、</p>
<p>這帶領遠洋船舶之引水人、乃負有五十至七十海里的駕駛責任、經過變遷不定之水道、與擁擠之內港、彼等之工作、需要高度之技巧、而個人所冐之巨險、（如於海中攀登大船）尙屬不計、决無外國輪船公司、甘於將彼巨船之駕駛、信託尙末具有外籍引水學員所規定至少資格之引水人之手、而輪船保險公司、對於船壳及貨物之保險、亦决不願收取同一之利率、因設有並未具有必需之資格之引水人使之在船橋担任駕駛也、總之自江口至港內一段之駕駛、爲一疑難而危水人時、則將來較大之船隻、也許返回從前的|不方便的、作法、起落貨色、上下人客、均在吳淞錨地行之、</p>
<p>按照某種特别章程、輪船公司本可自由拒絶某一特别之引水人、唯此種拒絶、向來極少、良由上海領有執照之引水人公會、向能維持其高的標凖、故將來勢必至於長久而有理由的反對錄用中國引水人、除非或直至輪船公司對於中國引水人已滿意、認爲彼等已具有外籍引水人同様之資格、或至少曾有司様之經騐、</p>
<p>海關官吏曾經表示、設如中國政府能於各引水人辭職或死亡時、担保付選所有引水人之股欵、則引水公會亦願不索酬報、將所有引水船隊交給中國政府、唯吾人觀於中國半官營業所謂輪船招商局者、其對於外籍船長、關於所賺得之養老金及贈與物之待遇、若無滿意之担保、實不足以使引水人置信而放膽爲此、蓋若輩半生積蓄、强半全投於引水船公司之股份、或竟有因此而舉債者、</p>
<p>其次則爲引水人之責任問題、照中國現有之海事法律、中國法院對於失事過誤之判决、不能令人滿意接受、</p>
<p>最後爲上海保障安全間題、在過去之十年中、列强曾經兩次有必須急調陸軍增防上海、经維持其內部之秩序、假使此種援兵而被延誤、出於中國引水人之不願、或拒絶引領此項載運援兵之船隻進口時、則事寗堪忍受、但如果引水事務而轉入中國人之手、外籍引廢除以後、則應視此爲將來可能之事（未完）</p>

<p>體恊會已接得正式通知書現着手辦理結束準備遷移今後體恊會暫移申園球場　　本埠法租界勞神父路中華全國體育恊進會之全部運動塲、有被地主美國洛氏基金團收回、轉贈國立上海醫學院建築醫院之說、相傳已久、今已醖釀成熟、昨據體恊會負責人談、已接得收回地皮之正式通告、限於本月底結束遷出、故體恊會方面現在着乎結束及準備遷移之舉、</p>
<h3 id="c224">球場面積與今後置 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>全部地皮、共一百十餘畝、東至具勤路、南至康悌路、北至勞神父路、西至薩坡賽路西面　旦大學止、惟以偌大地皮、完全建造醫院及醫學院亦屬過剩坆西面之足球塲、已由法工董局租下建造華童中學、南面之網球塲（卽棒球塲後面）、亦將由他人轉借下、繼續作網球塲之用、惟此事尙未至正式宣佈時期、姓名未便發表、</p>
<h3 id="c225">體恊接辦段簡史 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>全國體育恊進會成立於民國十三年、初假寫字間於本館三樓、民十四年卽從西人葛雷及格洛潑乎中收回接辦現在勞神父路一帶之全部運動塲、當初接辦時、因欲弭補西人所虧之萬餘元債項、曾由程貽　君捐助洋一萬元、故該運動塲之收歸體恊會辦理、程君之功甚大、</p>
<h3 id="c226">寫字間暫移申園球場 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>慘淡經營、已有十年歷史、近四五年來收回之說、盛器塵上、全國體恊會不謀實力上之竸爭、遂有今日正式被收回之事實、今後之體恊會、將以申園爲根據地、寫字間亦移於申園、恊進會之預爲凖備者、卽此而已、惟申園僅一足球塲血已、充其量祇能再建造三四口網球塲、且地皮亦屬臨時性質、目前因無人欲得此地、故得質時借用、不付租金、以門票收入、作若干之分拆而已、</p>
<h3 id="c227">十年之心血廢於一旦 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>十一年來之全國體育恊進會所做事業、昭然若揭、固母庸多　、對於勞神父路運動事之收回全滬運動界引爲莫大之遺憾、以接辦後十年來之棒球塲（勞神父路全部運動塲之統稱）仍廢於今日、實不能不歸咎全國體恊會不能爲事業作决心之奮鬥、旣往不咎、來者可圖、今後體恊會能否下一决心爲整個體育界雄圖善後之策、頃刻不容忽視矣、</p>

<p>以體恊會木身之事業而論、固非必需有運動塲者、塲地之有無、可謂毫無關係、惟體恊會之經費　來　、不得不藉比賽門票之收入、以資挹注、是以恊進會之所以必需運動塲者在此、而上海運動界固亦極希望恊進會能有一完善之運動塲、今勞神父路地皮之收回、體恊會將來事業　能否有一更新的聞拓、爲感可注意之事、聞今</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>他們吹吹打打的把太后送上戀與，或火車或其他代步的東西上去之後|總之，只要是太后離開了他們正在奏樂的所在，而開始望别處行去的時候，他們就得收拾好一切樂器，搶先趕到终點他上去候着，再把方才歡送時候所演奏的樂曲來歡迎伊。這様的一番滑稽的做俆，也有一個專用的詞，喚做「接駕」。</p>
<p>我對於這些樂器都是極愛玩弄的，尤其使我感覺相當的興味的，便是它們各個的歷史。所以在本書這一章裏面，我特把它們逐件的說明，像明，像上面、章裏所講的「八實」一様。同時，我還有一種很切實的認識，深信這些古樂器中傕有幾件是目下在世界各地流行着的新式樂器的始祖，正和人類是猿類進化下來的一般無二。</p>
<p>這些樂器中就有「磬」在內，或者是用銅鑼。「磬」也是「八實」之一，它的式樣，巳於上一章中講過了。眞的樂器和黃緞上所繡着的花様是完全相同的，我們可以無須再行複述。這一種樂器的用處是調和節奏，使全隊的樂聲忽徐忽疾，不致有呆滯之弊。本來，在那時候所奏的樂曲，都是很奇特的；似乎並没有一定的拍子，現在的人聽了，也許不會再感到什麽興趣。但是它們所發出來的莊嚴肅穆的音節，從你的聽覺上辦别起來，果然是很單調的，很不悅耳的，而在你的心靈上，却必有一種異様的感覺發生。這便是中國古樂特點。（四九）</p>
<h3 id="c267">琵琶行 <a href="#c267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>白樂天的琵琶行，是描寫音聲之技的一篇絶唱，因之九江琵琶亭，成了一個膾炙人口的古蹟，凡是騒人墨客經過那裏，總得把『同是天涯淪落人』一句詩，低徊諷誦，爲白樂天各商人婦一表同情。同偶然把這首詩講給學生們聽，有一個學生便發生疑問，以爲白樂天是當時的現任地方官，如何冒昧地登上一個有夫登婦的船上去，欣賞伊的妙藝？當時我只說，大約樂天因伊是歌妓出身，所以不嫌唐突，却没有怎様有力的辯護。後來見洪容齋三筆，他也有同様的批評，他說：『樂天移船，夜登其舟與飲，了無顧忌，豈非以其長安故倡女，不以爲嫌耶？』和我的意思差不多。又引長慶集在謪官潯陽，路過鄂州時，也有相類的艶遇，容齋以爲瓜田李下之嫌，唐人不譏。但是五筆又說：唐世法網雖於此爲寬，然樂天嘗居禁密，且謫官未久，必不肯乘夜入獨處婦人船中，相從飮酒，至於極彈絲之樂，中夕方去，豈不虞商人者他日議其後乎？』因此疑他是假託，经寫天涯淪落之恨，並不是眞有其人，眞有其事。那麽不是和西湖上的馮小青墓，一般使人上了七八百年的當麽？</p>
<p>許多題詠琵琶亭的，都是馬馬虎虎，借他人酒杯澆自已塊壘，只有宋朝淳煕年間，有一個四川詩人郭明復，他却說：『不管時人皆欲殺，夜深江上聽琵琶。』又說：『此公豈作少狂夢，與世浮沉聊爾汝。」是能揭穿樂天心事的。</p>

<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>昔人句：「深院下　　簾人晝寢，紅薔藢眏碧芭蕉一又云：「紅了櫻桃綠了芭蕉」則此牆東卓翠者，洵當今之佳卉也·</p>
<p>芭蕉爲多年生植物，高八九尺，莖軟，重皮相裏，外青裏白，葉甚修巨，一葉舒則一葉蕉概不謝落，與秋菊之不落花，同爲藝圃之俊物·三年以上著花，瓣大小不整，色淡黃，其實垂垂而長，卽香是，然非於熱地不熟。</p>
<p>芭蕉多異名，曰：甘蕉，曰：芭苴，又號扇仙，蓋葉可製扇，且舒展颭動，亦若扇之揮拂，故唐贒李玉溪有「芭蕉開綠扇一楊萬里有「繞身無數青羅扇」之句，比喩殊妙切也，更多異種，美人潐嬌小玲瓏，著花穠艶爲園林間不可少之物，贛州產鳳尾蕉，福州有鐡蕉，聞以鐡屑和泥壅之·羊角蕉結子尖銳，形若羊角·板蕉結實味淡·佛手蕉實小而甜，俗呼爲蕉子·雞蕉尤香嫩甘美，南之珍之，水蕉則不結實·膽瓶蕉其身特大，而其上漸小，至葉乃大開敷，長大翠綠，正如膽瓶中揷數枝蕉葉也·亭館列植，深可愛玩，亦名象蹄蕉，言如象蹄然。　　粤東人家多植蕉，緝之如麻，織爲衣，較葛爲美，名爲蕉葛·琉球更有芭蕉布，略帶褐色·東瀛人取以黏附於屏幛間，甚古雅也。</p>
<p>雨滴芭蕉，厥聲淅瀝越、然愁人聞之，爲之白端悵觸，不级自已·曲調趾因有雨打芭蕉一折·球大王李惠堂喜弄月琴輒於夜靜更深彈雨打芭蕉以爲排遣·其所著病中廻憶錄，冉述及之也。</p>
<p>我師石予先生，曩致景雲詞人書·言及芭蕉之韻致，耐人玩索，書云：「余家小樓日種蕉夺年，今高與樓齊矣·其葉放半月者，深綠色，放未十日，綠稍遜，初放一二日是，色淺碧，間以淡黃，凈比秋河，媚如春柳，毎當曉露夜月，推小樓之窗，倚小窗之檻，一種秀色清影，時涵溢於吟榻囊書妝臺奩鏡間·余家止此刦餘一樓，倘所謂一室小景非耶·王禹偁竹樓記云：夏宜急雨，有瀑布聲，冬宜密書，有碎玉聲·余於芭蕉亦云·方今盛夏，烈日可畏，而余空庭如張翠幕，綠陰濃厚，頗受其益也「。</p>
<p>但君杜宇，去夏賞作一油畫，邀予觀之，盡中一巨蕉葉披拂舒展，翠色欲流，裸女子蔭憇於下，葉受陽光，映裸女子肌　俱綠，佳妙至無倫比，的眼福。</p>

<p>古人作晝，忽於實而重於意境，故摩請丹青往往不開四時，袁安臥雪圖，雪中有蕉，高啓詩：「寒池蕉雪詩人晝」，卽謂此。</p>
<p>僧懷素學書無紙，種芭蕉萬本，以供揮灑，號其所居曰綠天庵，又南漢趙純節軒窗館宇，咸種芭蕉時稱之爲蕉迷·可與和靖之梅，淵明之菊，濂溪之蓮，子濂之竹，媲美千古。</p>
<p>堅瓠集云：一有人召仙，以芭蕉一葉置袖中，請仙賦之仙卽書云：「袖裏深藏一葉青知君有意侮神靈，今宵試聽芭蕉雨，久滴瀟瀟，二聲」蕉之神話，足資談助。</p>
<p>芭蕉可分其小株種之，若以簪脚橫刺二孔令洩氣，則低矮婆娑，終不長大，卽盆玩中物也</p>

<h3 id="c272">論欺編 <a href="#c272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— 洞若</p>
<p>欺騙，通常是被視爲一件不道德的事的，但我們的社會上，却存着層出不窮的欺編事實，　因而在我們的報紙上，每天都　可以獲得許多關於欺編的紀載。法律對於有些欺騙，像對於女人的拐帶，金錢的騙取，都認爲是一種犯罪行爲，要給予嚴罰和重科的，然而這一點也不能消滅或減少欺騙事件的發生。</p>
<p>這是爲的什麽呢？是由於欺騙的人有不誠實的天性嗎？是由於像龍卜；羅梳所說的這班人具有無可避免的犯罪行爲的頭蓋骨嗎？問題似乎不是這様單純的；在這裏，我們應該先考查一下欺騙的本質。很顯然的，欺騙是對於事實的歪曲，是企圖逹到某種利益的有意識的歪曲，在被他所欺騙的對象中，直接或間接取得某種利益。所以，欺騙這件事的本身，便帶着欺騙者和被欺騙者的分裂和盾矛；所以在一個社會裏，若是他的內部構成的分子，在利益上愈互相矛盾衝突的時候，欺騙所演的任務便也愈形繁複和重要了。根據這一點，我們便可以知道：資本主義社會的都市裏，欺騙事件的所以多過封建社會的，并不單純的是由於個人和個人中間的接觸頻繁，而最主要的原因，是由於資本主義下的個人主義，自由競爭，人和人當中的矛盾衝突，都比從前封建社會裏加深了。</p>
<p>知道了欺騙不是由於們不誠實的天性，或者是什麽與生俱來的犯罪行爲的頭蓋骨，而是牠發生的社會根據，我們便不難更進一步明白：欺騙不但是這個人對於那個人的使用，并且有時候竟成爲這一個集團對那一個集團的武器之一了。甲國和乙國劍拨弩張的時候，甲國用自已的通訊社散佈謠言，說乙國邊疆兵孌了；甲乙兩個政黨競選的當兒，各向民衆開空頭支票，打起爲民衆謀福利的旗子，不一様都是欺騙行爲嗎？</p>
<p>因爲欺騙在這社會演着巨大的作用，所以欺騙的藝術，便大有講求的必要了。一個著着襤褸衣服的人，他向高貴的小姐去求愛，說他家裏有萬貫家財，這是誰都可以覺察出來的欺騙，簡直無可語於藝術。</p>
<p>最高欺騙藝術，是表面上一篇大道理，而以欺騙爲骨髓的那些欺騙。</p>
<p>這種最高藝術的欺騙，一直被人類歷史上的有力者沿用着·········</p>

<p>— 蘭如寄自長沙</p>
<p>是前年的冬天，我去三德坊看小鹿，她對我說：</p>
<p>「小兵，你快去看看廬隠」，前次她來還在問你呢·她現在怪可憐的，你去看看她吧·　　「怎麼？怪可憐的，她不是已經和她的小愛人結婚了，生活得很幸福嗎？」</p>
<p>我聽了說她可憐的話，不覺大大地驚奇起來。</p>
<p>「結婚了雖然幸福，可是孩子不斷地來，這就使她苦死了！」</p>
<p>「現在生了幾個？」　　「雖然只有兩個，可是己經·········」</p>
<p>我知道底下没有說出來的話是什麽。</p>
<p>「唉！太苦了！那比生孩子還要苦痛，還要危險罷。」</p>
<p>「可不是嗎？她說做女人眞無聊，太痛苦了，倒是生不如死。」</p>
<p>我好幾次下决心去看她，而且有一次竟約好了輝羣女士，先在她家裏吃了晚飯，再去看廬隠，然後大家一同去看工部局女子中學的游藝會，後來不知臨時發生了一件什麽事，我失約了，没有去輝羣那裏吃飯，但我們後來終究在會塲碰着了。</p>
<p>「廬隠呢？」我問輝羣。　　「就在前面，你看見没有？咧，那位穿灰色旗袍的就是她。」</p>
<p>順着她的手指去，遠遠地我望見一幅消瘦的，憔悴的側面影，不覺長嘆了一聲。</p>
<p>「你要不要找她？輝羣間我。</p>
<p>「不要，這裏人太多，不好說話，還是改天我去看她吧。」</p>
<p>唉！誰知錯過了那次見面的機會，以後就永遠見不到她了！</p>
<p>廬隠，你個人是得到了解脫，遠離開了這苦惱的人間。但你在九泉之下，也曾想到你丈夫和女兒的悲哀？三歲的孩子，雖然不知道你是死了，她以爲你在睡着，等下就會醒來的。但這無知的幼兒的慘狀，更是多麽令人痛心呵！</p>
<p>廬隠，由於你的死，使我憶起了兩個好友，一是誰都知道失踪慘死的彬芷，一是和你同病而亡的冰之||烈文先生的故妻。你和冰之部被庸醫所誤，想起來眞痛心，一個女人的生命是多麽渺茫呵，不是死於刀槍之下，便是送掉在孩子乎裏。我不是樂生畏死的人，但對社會曾經有相當　獻，在文學上有希望的人，是不應如此輕輕地死去的。你們的死，不僅是文學上的一個損失，也是社會的一個損失呵！</p>
<p>寫到這裏，巳經韪起更時候，外面正下着大雨，響着暴雷，我放下筆，對着電光閃閃的天空呆望着，兩顆淚珠從我的眼裏掉下了。</p>
<p>廬隠，如果你死而有知的話，該了解我現時的心情！（完）</p>
<h3 id="c275">原是靈光舊地基 <a href="#c275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— 白戈</p>
<p>只要是到曲阜去尋聖蹟的人，大約沒有一個不會去拜訪周公廟的。第一，周公也可算得一位，聖人，而且還是堯，舜，禹，湯，文，武之後和孔子之前一位承先啓後的聖人，據說在儒家底道統上頗有一點地位。再則呢，據說現在的周公廟就是過去的靈光殿底舊址，那是一個正大光明的地方。這様，自然就在受着儒家洗禮的人們胸中構成一顆想去拜訪的心了。</p>
<p>廟，好像是在東門之外吧？總之，當我去的時候是從柬門出去的。聽說，過去的魯國就在這東門之外廟爲中心的曲阜却是那孔廟爲中心的曲阜卻是那時魯國底郊野。如里靈光殿是包在魯國城內的話，那魯國畢竟也可算得一個大國。因爲由東門走到周公廟去，其間要經過一片遼闊的田野。</p>
<p>從外表看去，特别是站在遠一點的地方，廟確很像一座巍峨的殿堂。參差的古樹濃蔭着廟頂，有些地方又疎疎地現出一片瓦脊，倘若是在晚秋的時候再加上幾點紅葉，那景色却也有些令人低佪的地方。周圍的紅牆早已凋頹了；要進去是可以不必從門而入的，所以更没有守護廟門的人，亦没有對於遊入的招呼各打擾，往往到不禁令人由一種陰森的感覺喚起一點嚴肅的感覺來。</p>
<p>剛一進門，那三軒兩廊底塵壁碎窗和那蹴足小徑上底荒榛漫草，都表現出一種凄凉的景色。當中走去，徑旁有一道不知還是亁隆或其他的人所建立的紀念碑。上面底題辭我已不大記得十分清楚了，只記得第二句是「原是靈光舊地基」，其餘都是一些贊語，給與遊人一個相信此地就是靈光殿底舊址的例證。想不到當時那樣一個喧赫的地方而今竟變成了這樣|這就無怪乎那些聖人之徒都在慨　禮這不張而要加以修　了。</p>
<p>更上一層，就是周公所居的正殿。彷彿當中只有周公一人坐着；並不像孔子那様，有許多門弟子排在兩旁陪着他，自然也就會令人覺得未免太孤冷了。我們雖然没有夢見過周公是怎様的人，但一看見那泥塑的様子就覺得好像是曾經見過的。一種帶着十分道學氣的熊度，正如我們在戲塲上常常見着正經鬚生一様。面是白白的，大半還帶着幾分書生氣。中國從來就有一句警吿，終於爲仕的讀書人的話：「文人不要帶書生氣」，這様的周公，似乎不爲人愛，也是當然的。不過，最近政府已决定於國庫萬分支絀之際劃出一部分的欵來修葺孔，孟，顏，周各廟，居然是有意在爲書生氣張目了。</p>
<p>拜記聖蹟，是應該先帶一顆景仰的心去的。許多古地各城之所以引起我們底懷慕和流連，大都是由我們先有一顆懷古和慕名的心而致。周公有什麽値得我們景仰呢？靈光殿又有什麽値得我們懷慕和流連呢？於是，我只得踏着無韻的足步漠然地出走了古老的廟門。</p>
<h3 id="c276">從「溪書晝展覽會歸來 <a href="#c276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— 穆木天</p>
<p>「也許將來方塊字根本會被廢止，中國文字會拉丁化起來，可是直到現在。書法總算是一種藝術。作藝術史的研究時，書法也是一個對象。」看完「竹溪書盡展覽會」從湖社歸來，在道中，我這様想。</p>
<p>「竹溪書盡展覽會」中，有沈尹默先生的字，和沈邁士先生的晝，共三百餘種。也許是對於人有特别的了解之故罷，我把注意的焦點差不多完全放到沈尹默先生的墨蹟上了。沈尹點先生的書法，數年前，在北京時，雖然時時看得到，然而如現在這様的豐富的生產，是已往所没見過的。</p>
<p>然而藝術品題不能以其數量估價，主要是看牠的質的如何。書法的藝術是一種什麽様的社會的產物，我是没有詳細研究過。但是，如古典的悲劇有獨特的美似地，書法的藝術，也是有其獨特的美的。我們可以從社會學的立塲上，作書法藝術的研究。但今非其時，我們尙没有那種時間的餘裕。不過在這無暇顧及那些問題的現在，書法的好壞，我們還是可以看得出來。有生命的藝術，有作者的創作的忠誠的藝術，無論牠是哪個歷史的階段之產物，總是會令人感動的。</p>

<p>這一年冬天，我第二次旅行到南洋。從菲律賓，婆羅州和爪哇跑到蘇門答臘。對於蘇門答臘，我是熟番得多了。十年前左右，我曾經在日里（一）屬下睥一個小地方，在我的姑丈關有光店裏當了一名書記。我是很喜歡遊歷的，附近地方，幾乎我都到過。　如現在有人來請我做蘇門答臘旅行的響導，那還可以滿意足的。　　這次我於旅行之外，還負着一些使命：國內某華僑學府託我調查最近南洋僑校的槪况，特别是在這南洋已經受了經濟恐慌的打擊的時光，僑校的基礎多半是動搖着的。還有某美術圖書公司託我乘便把南洋一些勝景，古蹟，建築物和其他的事物攝起影來，寄給他們，預備編一本南洋寫眞。所以我沿途除遊覽之外，還做調查和攝影的種種工作。在我的行李裏，已經堆積了不少的稿件和圖片。對於顯靈這神秘的太陽的國土，這些東西的價値是不小的。</p>
<p>到了棉蘭（二），把我的工作弄完妥了。想到不拉士打忌這高山上去攝些風景片，然後繞這從蘇島中部到篤名不綠，拜訪我這個十年前的舊居，看看我的親戚別來無　麽？看看我從尙帶童性的友伴現在怎様了？這時，南洋前經濟恐慌已是深刻化了，|和十年前我居留在這裏時候的黃金般的世界，是全然不同的。這，我在其他的地方巳經明顯地看到這在慘淡時没落中的景象了。呵，篤名不綠，這個小商埠，你也給「不景氣」這鐵掌厭握得怎様了？還在這裏掙扎着的我的老友僑胞們，你們竟給這無情的暴漢打轚到什麽様子呢？</p>
<p>懷着這様的心情，我於離不拉士打忌的第二天下午逹到我的目的地。呵，以前熱哄哄地來往的車輛那裏去了？路上的行人怎這般冷落呢？經過飮食館前，以前僑衆們聚賭和養養的喧閙，現在怎聽不見呢？當我從長途的汽車裏下來的時候，踏上我的親戚開着的羣與號這塊黑底金字的招牌之下，一陣陰森森的冷氣猛把我嚇了一跳。（那時的太陽倒是亮晶晶的，仍是熱帶的炎熱炙人的陽光。）一暼眼到店裏，只有冷靜靜地的一位夥在打瞌睡，二三位土大坐在地板上咕嚕地講着話。啊！以前應接不喂的買賈怎様變得這般冷靜？在從前，那是完全不是這個様子的。那時候買賣的繁忙眞足够使一個店夥腰酸手痛，那裏有空聞的時間讓你坐下來休息一下？更那讓你打瞌睡？</p>

<h3 id="c304">談言現代青年的性煩悶問題 <a href="#c304" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e304" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">304</a></h3>
<p>— 朋盒</p>
<p>人到青年期，便發生性煩悶問題。性底煩悶，是青年期一大難關。固然，性的需要，並不限於青年期，然而却以青年期爲甚，尤以青年期，性的煩悶，最爲危險。所以，常時有許多青年，爲着性的煩惱，而自已斵喪殘了，凋殘了，甚至於墮落了。這可見性的煩惱，所給予現代青年的打轚，是如何地厲害。尤其是在這繁華過度的都市中，末世紀的氛圍象，滿包着淫靡與狂樂，周圍惡劣的空氣，無時不極猛烈的戟刺着毎一個青年的心理，使大家都向着墮落的一條路上走。肉感的電影，粉腿，旗袍，馬路邊站着妖嬈的妓女，電影院裏極度肉感的跳舞，都是使毎一個人沈醉於淫樂衰頽的資料。正當性衝動極度緊張的青年，在這一極度惡劣的環境之下，誰個不被誘惑而走向墮落之途呢？所以，在這都市中，青年的墮落，其程度也就特别利害。</p>
<p>青年的如此日趨墮落，是特别可惜而且可怕的事。固然，儘有許多有志的青年，越是環境惡劣，他越能肯埋頭的苦幹；然而，一方卻儘有多少意志薄弱的青年，爲惡劣的環境所葬歿，這是社會的一個大損失。</p>
<p>青年爲什麼要如此墮落呢？這是，因爲目前的社會，根本不適宜於培飬青年。固然，一方面也可說，越是環境惡劣，越能磨勵出英勇有爲的青年；但一般的青年；卻終於不能不因環境的特別壞，而使其無法上進。如，農村是破產了，敎育是破產了，這使青年無法求學。連帶，都市也衰落了，這使青年無法得到職業。這都是使青年無法上進的許多根本原因。特别是性的問題，因爲目前這社會，正是處在新舊交替之中，舊的女子，卽無法使其滿意，而新的女子，又根本没有產生（卽有也可極少），而一方社會不平均的發展，因爲舊的社會勢力尙極濃厚的殘存的緣故，又使青年無法得到正常的男女社交。這樣，性的煩悶，就只有驅使青年走向墮落之一途了。青年的性煩悶，至相當時期，本來應該有正當的發洩的，而戀愛的在青年期也屬必需，而現在的青年，則這些都不能得到，這様，他當然只有墮落了，現代青年的墮落，實是社會使他這様的，這是極明明白白的事實。</p>
<p>然而，我們卻不要忘記，歴史是人類創造的，社會的不合理，就要我們去改造。這改造的責任，是誰應負担呢？當然，非我們青年莫屬。因爲，青年（比較窮苦的青年）一般是比較富有革命隆的。革命的青年，正是時代的前驅者。現在，我們青年的就要負起這改造社會推進歴史的責任。時代前的青年們，莫再彷徨，淫靡與享樂，只會葬送了你的一生，現在我們只有埋頭努力向前苦幹。只有埋向前苦幹，才是我們今日我們眞正的出路|自然這苦幹的目標，應該無疑義的是社會大衆。性的煩悶，不能葬送了你的一生，而同時，惡劣的環境，也决不能作你推卸責任的藉口。只有怯弱者，才會說你的墮落，是由於環境的逼迫而使然的。</p>
<h3 id="c305">約中劇社公演觀後 <a href="#c305" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e305" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">305</a></h3>
<p>— 羅平</p>
<p>挾着初夏的晚風，我走進了聖約翰約校門，是五卅時代燃燒起反帝的火焰的故地哪，現在是像夢一様地過去了。　　蒙X君的引導，走進了矞皇富麗的交誼室，舞台上父歸已經在開始了。</p>
<p>似乎不必再在這裏解釋父歸的故事了，是這様一個熟悉的劇七哩。曾看過四五次父歸的演出，然而用日本人的裝飾來演出對於我還是初次，可是，似乎不必那末過於忠厚吧？不但和服的對於觀衆生疎不入調，而且，還損害了劇情。宗太郎一件畢挺的西裝替代了破絮的棉袍，更因了身體的挺直，使宗太郎减少了不少的年紀，更使最後的傾跌突兀。珍娘不坐在椅在縫東西，老立在台中央和賢一郎說話眞有點兒不自然，宗太郎走了進來後也没有給他椅子坐，老立在臺中央挺着胸說話眞有點像要人在演說。布景的太富麗更没有帮助了被服裝等損壤孤劇情。</p>
<p>然而，最大的錯誤還是在把人們都省掉了的尾巴加添上，不但使賢一郎的個性因「天性」而矛盾，（亮是人所認的菊池寬的缺點）而且沖淡了悲劇的力量。本來，在宗太郎離開屋子後，以珍娘新二郎　妹哭喊着賢一郎和哥哥來結束的這一個悲劇效果是很大的，然而在這裏却編加進了尾巴而减少了劇的效果。當然，遣個責任還得歸之於把學生關緊在牢監裏不與外界接觸的這個奴隷敎育制度。它永遠不使學生去望牢監以外是怎様一個世界，在絶對禁止請女生表演的道一可笑的封建的觀點在更說明了奴隷敎育制　度怎様的不合理。</p>
<p>第二個劇本是生之意志，大體說來比父歸好，雖然這裏也有不少的缺點，如忘了掛母親的遺像，小孩哭聲太低，僕人的低級趣味化，但是幾個演員都表演得很好，特别是藍業申堅毅沉重地說：「因爲我的生之意志太强了，」打進了每個人的心坎，這一幕比較能令人滿意的，當然劇本的本身容易得到效果也是這一幕勝利的原因。</p>
<p>第三個劇本是「梅兩」，無論在演員，布景，故事諸方面都遠勝於前者。藍業申的阿巧，秦復基的阿毛，汪葆源的放印子錢者，馮紀忠的包探，汪津生的潘老板，因了個性的適合而得到了成就。雖然也依舊有其疵點，如阿毛的没有紥手，潘老板床的们置不當，然而這些小疵是都無害於整個劇情的勝利。</p>
<p>然而，如同把人們都省掉的父歸的尾巴添上一般，在這裏把有們都演的梅兩的尾巴省掉都是犯了很大的錯誤。當潘老板自殺後，（在這裏僅是倒去）阿巧和其老妻回來，哭着嚷；「爸爸，你爲什麽自殺了呢？張先生已經指示了我們一條出路，你看我們的光明不是快要來到了嗎？」這才更增添了梅兩的力量，然而在這裏是没有的。</p>
<p>也曾看我過約中劇社第一次的公演，然而從第一次到第二次之間的進步是令</p>
<p>人驚奇的。一方面因了演　員的經騐的增加，同時，劇本的內容的充實更增添了不少勝利的成分，自然，它也有着許多錯誤，但，我相信約中劇社的社員都有着很大的希望的，只要他們和牢監外的戲劇界的趨勢相一致不落伍，多多體騐社會，接觸社會，肯學習，肯努力，在一個健全的指導者而不是在造成洋奴的奴隷敎育制度及其附庸的桎梏之下。</p>

<p>— 羅伽</p>
<p>我似乎太殘忍了，不是嗎？路邊的小草，早已甜密的睡着了，駢鋪着的石子，已不堪牛羊的踐踏，趁夜的黑幔掛起，牠們就仲放着四肢，讓疲倦不再留　着，是的，那末我應該把脚步放輕一點。</p>
<p>輕輕的，我走着，酒精抹紅了我的臉，在我的眼前，飄着，飄着千萬隻黑的眼珠子一屬於某一個女人的美麗的黑眼珠子，我的耳邊，響着，響着林樆味的笑，這也是屬於某一個美麗的女人的</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>，這些，在今晚友人的宴會上，我巳經熟習了的，但，我現在劃開了夜霧歸去。而黑的眼珠子，和林樆味的笑，咬住了我的衣襟，跟着，跟着我到何處去呢！</p>
<p>寂寞的夜霚里，一切都有點模糊的，牠們不使他撞到牠們，而又常使你撞到牠們，我在酒精的醺醉，黑眼珠子和林摛味的笑的陶醉里，我摸索着，我要找出一條路，我可以歸家去的路。</p>
<p>夜的路上，該是令人想到可設想的地方，譬如說，在山麓的新塚傍，是閃着數點燐火的，但當我躡着脚走前去，那邊就有一個美麗的婦人，這婦女竟或是古詩人所描寫的絶代佳人，那時，她會毫不吝嗇的抛擲着一個個勾人魂魄的眼波，以及攝人知覺的笑，還有的，如同吟唱着的金絲夜的言語，這時，我應該怎様呢？那末我是趨上前去，抱住，緊緊的抱住，我醉心得閉上眼，狂吻，狂吻，可是，我驟然嗅到一陣腥，我睜開眼，一個紅鬆綠面的，拖長舌子的鬼，被我緊緊的抱着，她笑，像城墻崩壞似的笑哪，我怎様好呢！</p>
<p>夜的路上，是多幻念的，這種奇遇，我明知是不可能的，明知是可以駭怕胆的，然而，我願意有這麽一次奇遇，縱然，我轉被鬼拖進荒塚里。</p>
<p>但夜是美麗的，恬靜的，也不勢利的，牠可以使一個糾纏於俗務的人，在夜的路上，使你忘掉，另外的，使你生出種種夜路幻念，你在日間所不能遇到的他，夢裏所不能夢的，夜可以使你在夜的路上想到的，瞬息間，夜可以使你滿足的。</p>
<p>貓頭鷹的笑，還是日問所不能見的，但你在夜間，你可以毫不困難的聽到，聽到這夜的帝王的歌唱。</p>
<p>夜歸是今人領略到平日所未曾領略的，現在我都滿意的挹取了，可是令我掃興的，是家中的燈光，已經閃動在我的眼前了啦。</p>

<p>從勞勃生路的起點到終點，全如星羅棋譜般的工廠，維持了奴隸般的勞動者的生存？其實是將勞動者壓成了奴隸，每天的上午五點鐘與下午五點鐘，便是勞勃生路最熱閙的時期，一切活動全都開始了。這是萬千工人的怒號，更是萬千工人的慘呌，經此哀號與慘呌，成羣的勞動者，便開始。這裏有：無名角色的露天舞台，包含了京劇，小調。文明戲（新劇社）出戲法（魔術類）這是勞工的藝術欣賞，這才是大衆的總合藝術。二三人的串演，倒也能引起數百十的觀衆，可惜這些都是抵劣趣味，近乎下流！</p>

<p>或者正是因爲限，所以才寫不出；如不限，也許就極容易的洋洋千萬言了，放下　，　不覺這様的想。爲着肚子，爲着稿費，更爲着寫不出，雖還未敢搗亂後方，亦未免有點怨恨從心裏爬出了。</p>
<p>其實這是我的錯，我們在社會上，何時何地遭逢不到限制呢？可以由着我們底性子呢？那些不便於我們的豐不百倍的嚴重要於一千字的限制麽。我們還不是服帖帖的順從它，敢絲毫反抗它怨恨它麽？何獨於「一千字」呢！</p>
<p>而况事實上地位有限，乞屁飯食者又多，怎能讓王奶奶獨自放她底　脚布呢？現今天下的看官又没有這様的臭癖</p>

<p>了。他們喜歡吃一頓經濟飯，要亁脆而短俏。</p>
<p>至於文章的寫出或寫不出，究與限制無涉。正如會打拳的雖帶着鐐銬，也能施出全身的解數，不會打拳的卽散手散脚的，也弄不出一點身段手勢來。可見限不限毫無關係了。</p>
<p>這様一想，知道不能怪人，只能怪自已太蠢，連一千個字的文章，都凑不起來，白聽肚子內的餓虫嘰咕了。</p>

<p>— 非</p>
<p>時間底輪子是不迭地向前轉着，轉着：陣陣底薫風，巳帶來了初夏底暖意。光陰是毫不容情地趕走了人們底青春，由春而夏，由夏而冬，一年間底時光，也只在一霎那間已掠了過去。短促底春光，也終於在人們不知不覺中，偸偸地消逝了！</p>
<p>一年容易，又到夏季；從小販口中刮辣鬆脆白糖梅子····」的聲調，已換上了「山上枇杷」的呌喊了。現在，櫻花梅子　過時，而白沙枇杷便又跟着上市：從鄉下人把枇杷一船一船，滿載着的送進了都市，再從小販們底　上，轉送到了吃底人手中口中，嘗着味道兒，酸底。甜底。不錯，都市裏底人們，口福畢竟是好，様様東西都吃時新貨的。</p>
<p>「蠶老枇杷黃！」這句話，在吾們底鄉間是最流行的；恐怕連三歲底小孩子也都懂得的。目前，春蠶大都已經上簇，所以一片綠蔭沉沉底枇杷山上，都纍纍然顯出那，黃黃的，圆圆的，一顆顆底可愛的枇杷。山上常有三五個小孩在看守着，絶不像平時那末地靜寂，靜寂得鬼也捉得出了。</p>
<p>一枇杷黃在山上，繭子白在簇上。「這是爲鄉民人人腦筋裏幻想着底一種美麗希望，「四月裏的黃金　脚背。「因爲農村裏底一年大望，全靠這末一個季節，無論是黃的白的，都可變成花花綠綠的鈔票，和雪白光亮底大洋錢。</p>
<p>吾鄉||洞庭山||的白沙枇杷，本來是很有名的，可惜上海多數人底口福選欠修到。因爲他們吃的所謂山上枇杷，完全是塘棲貨；塘棲枇杷早熟面目好看，價亦較賤，但吃起來，却酸澀而味淡。山上枇杷則不然，它底成熟時期至少要在諯午後一尾期，然而它底看相够不上塘　貨，並且價亦較昂，可是上了口就有分别了。因其甜如蜜而汁有粘性，不過也有好壞之分：種類也很多，白沙中最上等底要算青種，　齊種次之，穿腦更次之。除此之外，還有一種紅毛白沙，和一種青甜種，味都不亞於青種。但紅毛白沙，人家都不識其爲白沙的，原因是它底式様和紅沙，全没有兩様，青甜種則始終是青青底，一顆，没有絲毫黃色，呌誰看了也不要去吃它的日　是紅沙，也有好多種，如早紅，落地紅等。</p>
<p>吾在幼年底時候，只要見樹上底枇杷翻一淡黃色，一顆小心靈中，就出些要快活得什麽似的；因爲，這時蠶事巳罷，學堂裏又不須去，終日只在山上同幾個小朋友躍跳嬉戲日間三餐，由母親或姊姊，送到山上來吃，晚上，和租母宿在山上。有時候，拉關了尖銳底小喉嚨，唱着：「上山下山，啥人啦浪倫枇杷？瞎子看見的，聾　聽見的，啞子吿訴的，蹺脚追着；半山裏的野鷄，打呀老鴉，老鴉打得呌哇哇！」喊得口喝了，便扒上樹去揀大底，熟的枇杷摘幾篗下來吃着，拿吃下睞皮和核，一古腦兒丢在茶樹肚裏，因給媽見了是要駡的，打的。</p>
<p>現在，吾一見到了枇杷，便會想起吾底童年，同時，便也勾起了吾美麗底殘夢！</p>
<p>吾從十七歲底那年，衝入了都市，今年差不多已經十個年頭了。然而經過了幾番底滄桑之後，到如今還是依然故吾！在每年，逢到了枇杷底季節。總是對着枇杷而傷感！舊地風光，已非曩昔，而枇杷山上也十年没有吾底足跡了。玉腿一撣、黃金千萬！</p>
<p>畸形的社會矛盾的都市奔波千里、銅九兩枚！</p>

<p>— 光宇</p>
<p>在初夏的晚上，時候正交八點鐘。一家汪資產階級的臥室裏，紫羅蘭的電燈，放出了極温柔的清輝，色彩是最調和也没有。</p>
<p>臥室的主人，是一對攫輕的夫婦。那時，男主人正在那裏開留聲機消遺，女主人靠在沙發上靜聽那從留聲機中出來的歌詞，她的手上，還執着一本現代歌曲集，她的視綫，是集中在那本歌曲集上。</p>
<p>臥室的正中，放着一隻搖床，床內睡着一位約摸一歲開外的孩子。不消說，那孩子就是這一對年輕的臥室的主人的愛的結晶了。</p>
<p>外還有一個奶媽。雖然她也年輕，但看了她那一副顦顇的臉容，便會使人立刻明白過來，她是一個早經人世間憂患的薄命女子了。</p>
<p>這時，搖床上的小主人，因爲吸飽了一肚子的用金錢從别一個孩子那裏奮過來的奶水，已陲呼睡了，所以那奶媽就由她的女主人，於吃飽了飯不應該没事做的條件下，命令她來敲自已的背脊自已　人的粉腿了。</p>
<p>「乳娘曲那張唱片，眞是奸聽呀！親愛的、你將它被出來，唱一遍我聽聽吧！我這能跟着它唱呢」！當留聲機的歌詞，一曲完畢已後，女主人回過臉來，對立在機旁的丈夫，送了一個媚人的秋波說。</p>
<p>眞的你會唱乳娘曲嗎？那眞好極了。」</p>
<p>「誰騙你！」女主人答着，「　　，唱得不甚麽好罷可一！</p>
<p>於是，男主人便關始去檢片子，女主人也把她手上所拿着的歌曲集，一頁又一頁翻着，尋找那則所謂乳娘曲的歌詞。</p>
<p>|秋雨···滴梧···桐，···秋花滿紅，···</p>
<p>這様地歌詞，終究從留聲機上傳將出來，女主人便隨聲和着，男主人也高舉左臂，在替她按轚拍。</p>
<p>|愛和，···恨，···是···重···重；···恩和···仇，···是種···種···</p>
<p>|十···月懷胎娘···心···痛···哇哇一···聲···兒的啼聲雄。······</p>
<p>「親愛的，你的歌喉美極了，比唱片上的更脫耳呢！一男主人這様地恭維着，女主人却不做一聲，一直在唱她的歌。</p>
<p>|金錢呀！···拆散了人家···母子不相逢。階級呀！···你把我的嬌兒···送了···終···</p>
<p>|我要···見一見···兒的笑···容，···我要···瞧一瞧的睡···容。···</p>
<p>「可不是？親愛的，孩的睡容，委實太可愛了呢！一男主人裝着玩皮的笑臉，指了指睡在搖床上自已的孩子說。</p>
<p>女主人始終不把她歌聲中止。　　|我要見嬌兒，···除非在夢中。···　　那時候的張奶，早被留聲機和她女主人的歌詞，刺痛了她的心，偸偸地流着淚。</p>
<p>「張奶，你好端端在怎麽文哭了」？男主人發見張奶在下淚，心裏好生不悅，便厲聲地說。</p>
<p>女主人也立刻把歌聲中止，一層愁容，立刻掛上她的紛臉。暴跳着說。「我倆高高興興地，你偏要來觸我倆的霉頭嗎，」</p>
<p>女主人的躁閙聲，驚醒了搖床上的小主人。張奶連忙跳過去把他抱起，放在自已的懷裏。她一面把乳頭塞進他的小嘴，一面裝着笑臉對她的兩位年輕的主人認着不是説，「好少爺，好奶奶，我没有哭呢！剛才因爲有一條飛絲，吹進了我的眼眶，我一時張不開眼，淚珠兒也流出來了。好少爺，好太太，你們想，你們待我多好，我還有甚麽不如意呢！」</p>
<p>賢明的主人，經過了張奶這一番軟化的解釋以後，已寛恕她了。但從此以後，可憐的張奶，連那一點僅有的暗自垂淚的權利，也喪失了。</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>說也慚愧，我現在遇到一個關於婚姻上的問題竟不能解决，我久已留意貴報信箱，是社會上的明燈，青年的指導。我以十二萬分的誠懇，來要求先生給我一條明路，我捊大了眼在盼望着，盼望着。</p>
<p>四五年之前，我家長替我訂了一個從不相識的女子做未婚妻，我自然是不　意。所以在前年認識了一位日女士之後，便由友誼而發生戀愛，一年之中，我們的熱度，差不多將逹沸點，那時要好的程度，眞是卿卿我我，大有願作鴛鴦不羨仙之概。同時，我也曾留意過，H女士對於我，的確没有一毫虚僞。那知到了今年，H女士不曉得爲什麽，忽然和我疎速起來，反而另和一個青年發生戀愛。請問，我還是繼續向H女士追求，表明我的心跡，以期言歸於好呢？還是屈服於舊禮敎之下，而和一個無愛情可言的女子結合呢？不過，日女士確實是不可多得的女子，先生務必請你替我解决，藉作南針。專此敬請</p>
<p>撰安　　　　　　　　　鄙人蔣思敬啓　　答：她以前你，現在「另和一個青年發生戀愛」，那明明是她覺得你没有那個青年可愛，所以與你「疎遠」而和他人接近。這不是她對於你有所悮解。你要和她表明心跡，請問，表明什麽心跡？表明眞心愛她麽，也未必能感動他，因爲她並不是覺得你不愛她而另愛旁人。</p>
<p>你現在所應當做的，不是自已去「表明心跡」，倒是要求她「表明心跡」。如果她斬鋼截鐡，老實對你說，是不愛你了，你也就死心榻地；如她說，並未愛上旁人，當然再好没有，馬上「言歸於好一；最討厭的是她愛你又愛旁人，假如有這種表示時，你就非審愼不可。我意，三角戀愛爲危險，如她有這種念頭，欠切不可留戀，免得兩敗俱傷。</p>
<p>與她絶交也不一定就要「屈服於舊敎」，這完全是兩件事。如你不願與「無愛情可言的女子」結婚，絶交後也可不結婚。我覺行你這次與H女士戀愛，自已也有不當之處，你旣訂過婚約，怎應另和旁人戀愛，縱令不滿該種婚約，在該婚約有效期間內，也應保持貞潔。幸而現在你和她產生了裂痕，否則，「卿卿我我」熱烈得很，但「鄉下姑娘」又擺脫不了，這該多麻煩。所以此次她另愛旁人，你未將原約解除，亦許是一個動因。　　　　　　　　編者</p>

<h3 id="c315">建築工程値得注意之空氣汚濁問題 <a href="#c315" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e315" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">315</a></h3>
<p>像上海這様的大都會中，人口有三百多萬，工廠也不可勝紀，那麽這一個空氣的汚濁問題，尤其以工廠烟突中所噴出的烟霧，當然是不可避免，然而在建築工程的設計者，起造者，及承造者的各界人士，似乎對於這一點大都是忽略了，其實這到是種極嚴重而値得注意的問題，卽是在海外的各國，對於這AirPoIIution的問題，研究得也很熱忱，茲者，記者約略把他們研究之所得就空氣汚濁之原因，空氣汚濁對於建築物之影響，及設計注意之點，三項概述如下：</p>
<p>空氣汚濁之原因</p>
<p>在城市中，空氣所以汚濁之最大原因，當由於各工廠烟突之狂噴，以及各處之遣層，漏氣，磚粉，五金末，及其他物質之風化餘粒，這種種全部空氣中，本無所有，而日漸混入者，於是空氣亦隨之而自純潔變爲汚濁矣。旣空氣之汚濁以烟塵爲最要主因，則其汚濁之雜物，亦可想而知矣，蓋燃料中多含炭素，及少量之硫質，是則經過燃燒之後，其排洩物當不外乎一氧化碳，二氧化碳，二氧化硫，三氧化硫等種，另外再氫氧化銨，或將亦有混入，而是種氧化物，一經水化，極易變成酸素，若碳酸，若硫酸，其汚濁空氣中之留存最夥者也。</p>
<p>空氣汚濁對於建築物之影響　　空氣汚濁之後，其對於建築物之影響，可分水料，鋼料兩種來講。　　關於水料者，如石類，水泥，摩太，三和士之類，是也。其用於建築物之外圾者，極夥，若受炭素灰麝等所汚，有碍觀瞻，其實非淺，然此猶其可以水洗者也，若爲空氣中之烟突濃烟所噴之柏油（CoarTar）所汚，則以其富於黏附性，必將深深自石孔嵌入，乃無法可去，而復稍經空氣中之梳酸等侵蝕之後，建築物之表面乃開始剝落，而不能如初之美矣。</p>
<p>石類者石灰，大理石，橄欖石等，以含碳酸鈣較多，極易感受侵蝕；花</p>
<p>崗石，片麻石，沙岩石等，則所含極少，比較耐損。於是外表之美麗，將爲剝奪殆盡。</p>
<p>水泥，三和土類，以其中所含石灰質，將受酸化而成爲石膏新質，且也更將因之而使其中所含鋁鹽之體之積，能澎漲至三倍以上，而此種內部漲力，其影響及水泥及三和土之抵抗能力甚巨。</p>
<p>摩太，以含有孔隙過多，故所受之影響，將更劇烈。</p>
<p>關於鋼料者爲鋼鐡，銅鋅等物是也，其用於建築物之表面者，受汚一點正與水料同，且更有銹壤之一弊。</p>
<p>銅鐡，是爲最易受汚濁空氣之損害者，雖其可用鋅或錫鍍飾，然其包皮一破，則爲害更烈，且腐蝕將隨之而至。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c316">論沙岩石爲造酸工廠建築酸池之唯一材料 <a href="#c316" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e316" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">316</a></h3>
<p>近年來以建築材料之突飛猛晉，舉凡以前之應用天然石塊爲材料者，現幾盡爲鋼鐡金屬及其他人造材料所替代，雖有亦僅少數或只爲裝飾之需耳。然要知鋼鐡及士敏土等均易受高温酸液之侵蝕，而至剝落鬆脆之弱點，不若天然石類之較能多具抵抗性，故現今之趨勢，凡重工業工廠之酸池，其建築也，材料以取用天然之沙岩石（（Sandstone）爲佳，蓋若用鋼鐡建築，則其鋼鐡之表面，必需電鍍以極厚之鋅層，方肥抵抗侵蝕，而用生鐡，則亦須有琺瑯質爲之保護，然琺瑯質本身極易脫落，是故亦不能運用完美；至木質材料，當然更不値高温度强酸之一觸。然事實經騐，固早示吾人以石片石條，較能抵抗酸素之侵蝕，其各種拒酸之配備要點，則各方似乎均有一已之秘密存在，惟一考究竟，蓋沙岩石類，天然具有其抵抗酸素侵蝕之本能，而不必加以配備者也。</p>
<p>查沙岩石，係水成岩石之一，其主要成份，卽爲沙質，（Sand），故曰沙岩，岩床以成於水力故，均有　次，石理以由於大小沙粒所組，　不一致。所含䃶質，以石英（Ouaf）爲最　　其餘爲爲化鐡，及　十等，此外極少雜物。其色有灰色，灰白色，以至牛肉色，褐色，紅色等，各各不一，由於所含礦物質份啊之都動而各異，石英愈多，則色澤愈淡，而甚至全白，若多於氣化鐡等，則色乃漸深，因此由於色澤之外觀而可决其所含各物比例之多寡。其所以能抵抗酸素之理，則以其所含礦物中大量之石英能不被酸侵故也，是知沙岩之色白而含石英較多者，當更宜於是類酸池建築材料，爲施工選料所宜注意之一點。此外爲建築可靠起見，吾人可更用細密之方法加以化學分析，當能得更形眞確之成份，在求大量石英之外，更須求得鐡質之絶無僅有，否則鐡質爲酸漂去，石塊之本身卽受損害，而將影響及整個之建築。再者可復用顯　鏡檢視之一法，以詳研其石質之結褠與結晶體熊兩項，及色澤，乃可吏增精密之程度。迨夫石質之檢　已備，石塊之選擇亦定，乃可開山取石，截石成片，施暏工事矣　　施工之法，四壁一底，池之定形，不必多說，石片長闊，愈大愈佳，蓋多一石縫，卽多一罅漏之處，頗不合宜，各縫接笱之處，雕作石工必須考究，而膠合之料，可用石棉一物，爲增强對水所貯酸液之橫壓力計，可於石池外壁，箍以鋼條，藉資耐用，惟鋼箍位置，必須高出平時池中貯酸最高限度一呎以上，方能萬全。</p>
<p>此外關於酸池建築中，應加注意之點尙多，若爲增高酸液温度用之蒸汽水汀管，其質料須用鉻釩鋼（ChromineVanadiumSteeiSteeI）鎢鉬鋼（TungstenMoIydbenum）鵭鉬鋼（CodaItMoIybdeunrn）及其他相彷之合金，方得抵抗酸素之侵蝕。而沙岩石質之如含有石灰質者，則千萬不能應用，以石灰質易被酸化故也，亦須注意。</p>
<p>夫重工業之在中國，可稱尙在萌牙期間，酸素製造廠，僅兩三處所，嗣後此類工廠之興繼，爲工業發展之所必需，而是種酸池之建築，亦爲必不可少，而硫硝鹽三酸中，尤以濃硫酸之爲烈，惜乎前時苦於不得最佳之拒酸材料爲築酸池，余故爲述此文，以公大衆，蓋吾國地大物愽，而復多山，沙岩之出產雖不若石灰岩之多，然亦不得謂，足供將來工業發逹後之應用，願吾建築各界有以誌之。</p>

<p>— 仲琴</p>
<p>儲藏室，這是農村之中的建築所必須要設備着的一間房屋，因爲在農村之中，最重要的事情就是所謂「秋收冬藏」，藏食物是最主要問題的一個，農民的生活亦完全繫於這儲藏工作之上，在歐洲及美洲各國的農村建築物之中，最主要的一間房屋亦爲儲藏室，在儲藏室之中，保護特别的周密，農民一家的生命綫全在於此，儲藏室的四周大楖右以使儲藏便利一些之故，不使有一些的障碍存在，而藏物之後又可以閉固起來，不使蟲類等物侵入，歐美各國的儲藏以麥爲主，我國的儲藏以稻爲主，所以儲藏是一様的，而在設備這儲藏室之時是應當考慮一下這一家所要藏物的大小，否則不免有過少或過大之慮，使農民對於這儲藏室不很歡迎，至於老式的榖倉那種設備那是現在所不適宜之物了。</p>
<p>儲藏室之外，那就是居屋了，居屋不必起造樓屋，當然在農民的經濟狀况之下是不適宜於造樓房的，但是在建造之時必須顧及農民的衛生，那才不致於有對於農民身體上的困難問題發生，如果是一個許多農民合居之處，那時可建造一所好像宿舍式的房屋，在農村之中有比設備雖然很感不易於使用，但是在歐美的農村之中有紫設備，而我國農村之中有宿舍式的房屋未嘗不可以適用的　　此外尙須於每一農村之中建立一所公衆的娱樂塲或會議應之類，這様旣可以提高農民的知識，又可以使農民得到相當的安樂，也是必須要有的。</p>
<p>在歐美的農村建築中，大概是三進的房屋，二房全爲儲藏室，中間一空屋汽車可開入（歐美農民都有運貨小汽車（，儲藏便利，而居屋則在內面，但在我國的農村之中，尙未能適用此種建築也</p>

<h3 id="e1">Railway Opening to Shenyang to Occur Mid-Month; Tangshan Factory to Build 24 New Cars <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) The opening of the railway to Shenyang can be implemented around the 16th of this month. Currently, representatives from the South Manchuria Railway, including Gokyu, are preparing for the opening in Yuguan. (4th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Key Chinese and Japanese railway personnel who participated in the Beidaihe meeting included, from the Beining Railway: Xu Ji, Chief of the General Affairs Department; Chen Qingwen, Chief of the Traffic Department; Wang Xuan, Chief of the Accounting Department; and Ye Yuwen, Chief of the Inspection Section. Representatives from the South Manchuria Railway included Kimura, Traffic Representative; Kaneda, Accounting Representative; and Kikue Yano Nakamura. Kimura was an important figure in the negotiations regarding the Northeast Railway before the September 18th Incident. Kimura and others returned to Shenyang after the meeting. The meeting focused on technical cooperation for the railway opening. Regarding the distribution of ticket revenue, the Beining representatives proposed establishing an audit section with equal representation from both sides, with weekly settlements. The Japanese side agreed. The scheduled departure times for the trains have been set using the Beining Railway's third and fourth special express train schedules, with trains operating daily. The train symbols will be changed to the symbols of the International Travel Agency. The characters for "South Manchuria" and "Beining" on the trains will be removed. The locomotive issue was heavily debated by both sides. The Beining representatives argued that the South Manchuria Railway locomotives entering the Guannei section, where the drivers' skills might not be proficient, posed a significant safety concern for train operations.

The meeting was chaired by Wang Zhaoming. Kong Xiangxi reported, stating that the bankruptcy of China's rural economy is becoming increasingly serious, not only due to disasters but also due to the lack of regulation of production and the low price of grain harming farmers. In order to provide relief, the government must first abolish excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance recently convened a financial conference, which first discussed the reorganization of land tax, the reporting of land, and the abolition of excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies, all in an effort to revive the rural economy. Fortunately, the representatives of all provinces held a consistent will and supported the central government. The reorganization of the land tax plan has been passed. The spirit of the conference was good from beginning to end. He hoped that all comrades in the party would assist the government in implementing all the resolutions of the financial conference to relieve the suffering of the people and realize the party's principle of people's livelihood. The meeting adjourned at 9:00 AM. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 4th)</p>

He continued by discussing the compensation measures after reducing the additional land tax and abolishing excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies. Finally, he expressed his hope: (1) to reduce the burden on the people and nurture vitality; (2) to maintain internal and external stability and establish a basis for unity; and (3) to gain international approval. He also said that the various resolutions passed at this conference were based on practical and feasible principles. He hoped that the entire country would work together to urge local authorities to implement them effectively. Since local authorities and military leaders are mutually connected, they must cooperate to ensure smooth implementation. Considering the situation in our country, the current temporary trade deficit is not a cause for concern, but the backwardness of production and the failure to make progress in the future are of great concern. The resolutions of this conference, which aim to promote increased production, encourage domestic goods trade, and develop the national economy, should be vigorously promoted to relieve national difficulties and save the country from danger. He hoped that the entire country would be of one heart and mind, uphold the Prime Minister's principle of people's livelihood, unite sincerely, and work together.

Zhu suffers from gastrointestinal illness and will go to Shanghai for medical treatment within a few days, returning to Gansu in about two weeks. Zhu stated that, in addition to visiting Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and President Wang to report on the political situation, he also requested assistance with financial difficulties. Gansu Province used to spend more than one million yuan on salaries each year during the late Qing Dynasty. After the 1911 Revolution, the coordinated salary was interrupted. At that time, military expenses were very small, and it was still possible to manage. In the 18th year of the Republic [1929], when Ningxia and Qinghai were separated from Gansu, military and administrative expenses ballooned, resulting in a huge deficit. The people suffered from natural disasters and war, and many were displaced. Fortunately, the problem of Sun Dianying's army was resolved before the spring plowing, and the farmers were not affected. However, post-disaster recovery is urgently needed. Under the guidance of the Economic Committee, water conservancy and road construction projects are underway. However, due to limited financial resources, it will be difficult to achieve results in the short term. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 4th)</p>

According to Wang Chengying, the total amount of surcharges and taxes in Zhejiang Province is no less than 16 million yuan. Even if the central government plans to allocate tobacco, alcohol, license taxes, and stamp taxes to Zhejiang Province, it would only be 1.43 million yuan, which is less than one-tenth of the total. Therefore, if they are abolished, the administration will inevitably come to a standstill. In the future, the only option is to try to abolish those that are close to excessive taxes first.

<h3 id="e22">Current Commentary: Japan's Intention in Rapidly Building the Chaoyang-Chengde Railway <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Japan is building a dense transportation network of railways and highways within the four northeastern provinces. The railways are being actively constructed with the intention of using them for military purposes, while also supporting economic and political goals. The boldness of their aggressive tactics forces our people to abandon any thought of complacency. First, let's examine the Chaoyang-Chengde (Jehol) line. In late May of this year, Hayashi Hirotaro, the president of the South Manchuria Railway, along with the company's directors and engineers, went to Jehol to inspect the roadbed of the Chaoyang-Chengde line, stating that the road would be completed in August and operational in September or October. On the surface, this move seems insignificant, but its intention to control the economy is very clear. It is well known that the Jehol region is mountainous and difficult to traverse. There is only one highway route, which has little economic value. Relying on this to develop Jehol is impossible, as the development of minerals and the transportation of wool and leather require heavy-duty and long-distance tools. Moreover, Japan's light industry has reached a high level of development. It does not produce cotton or wool and relies on imports for raw materials. Once an international war breaks out, it will be in a disadvantageous position. Therefore, it is planning day and night to find a place to acquire fiber raw materials. Since the wool quality is good, how could it not urgently seek development? Considering the current situation, Japan has airplanes in the air and highways on the ground in the Northeast. Having these transportation tools in Jehol, where the population is sparse, seems sufficient. However, cars cannot carry heavy goods such as wool and minerals. Even if they can barely carry them, the freight costs are too high, which is not commercially viable. Moreover, Japan's domestic [including Taiwan and Sakhalin Island] oil production, even at its peak, was only 403,000 tons per year. Last year's production was only about 250,000 tons, while its current needs are about 4 million tons. The remaining 3 million tons of oil are imported from overseas. Once imports are cut off, all its activities will be forced to stop. Therefore, Japan is willing to use relatively heavy tools to facilitate their use. Although railways are not as fast as the latest means of transportation, they can carry heavy loads over long distances and are not easily destroyed by external forces or hindered by natural forces. Therefore, Japan is rushing to build this road.</p>
<p>The most noteworthy aspect is the control of the local economic organization. Since airplanes and cars cannot provide practical economic control, it is necessary to focus on the railway. As seen recently along the South Manchuria Railway and other lines in the Northeast that are controlled by the South Manchuria Railway, freight charges have been increased for local agricultural products, preventing them from circulating externally. As a result, the prices of soybeans and other grains have fallen, leading to agricultural decline and facilitating their exploitation. At the same time, Japanese industrial products can be transported in large quantities to squeeze out the limited local industries. The economy of the three northeastern provinces is already groaning under this suffering and cannot easily recover. The completion of the Chaoyang-Jehol Railway will only continue this trend. It is generally recognized that Japan's policy of aggression is not limited to the economy. Their so-called continental policy in politics will further advance to the west to survey Chahar and Suiyuan, and to the south to peek at Hebei, which is also a concern for the people of the country. Before the Jehol railway is completed, although they have an advantage in terms of terrain, their difficulty in using troops is the same as ours. In the territory of Chahar and Suiyuan, which is a vast desert, we can still use our clumsy strength in the past, muster our national blood sincerity, and reluctantly fight back. However, in a period of just over a year, they have overcome the difficult obstacles of mountains and forests and deployed their active policy, leaving no room for our people under their iron heel to breathe. Economically, they can only be exploited by them. In military terms, they are even more concerned about being in a passive position. Furthermore, the disturbances in the East are not yet over. Our country's military and police cannot freely exercise their functions and are restricted everywhere. This situation is deliberately prolonged to facilitate the implementation of their strategies. It is expected that after the completion of the Jehol railway, they can use more facts as an excuse, and the transportation of troops will be more convenient. The difficulties in the East will inevitably increase. Chahar, which is close to Jehol, is even more at the forefront, and there is a risk of being invaded at any time. How will our people deal with this major threat?</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Soviet Ambassador visited Foreign Minister Hirota this morning to discuss negotiations on revising the ruble-yen exchange rate, and to discuss the incident of three "Manchukuo" boats on the Heilongjiang River being fired upon by Soviet border guards. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Japan and Russia exchanged notes today regarding the shooting of "Manchukuo" vessels by Soviet border guards while allegedly taking photographs on the Heilongjiang River, further escalating tensions. Soviet Russia issued a stern warning in response to Japan's protest, stating that "Manchukuo" vessels must immediately cease reconnaissance of the Soviet border or bear the consequences. This warning was delivered to the Japanese diplomatic representative in Harbin last week but was only officially announced last night. The warning was a response to Japan's protest against the shooting of "Manchukuo" vessels by Soviet border guards, which resulted in two deaths and injuries. The Soviet government countered that the border guards fired as a warning and did not directly bombard the vessels. The two individuals on the "Manchukuo" vessels were attacked by bandits within "Manchukuo's" borders. Furthermore, according to international law, if warnings are ineffective, Soviet border guards have the legitimate right to fire upon "Manchukuo" vessels. For the sake of peace, both countries are considering forming a committee to investigate the matter. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The following TASS news has been released here: Regarding the protest made by Manchukuo's Deputy Negotiator stationed in Harbin, Shimamura, to Soviet Consul-General Slavutsky, the Soviet Foreign People's Committee instructed Slavutsky on June 1st to notify Shimamura as follows: You were notified on May 24th that, based on the results of the investigation carried out in accordance with instructions from the central authorities, it was proven that the "Di Cheng" vessel incident occurred because the vessel illegally approached the Soviet shore and systematically photographed key coastal defense areas, and because the vessel disregarded repeated warnings from the shore and continued to approach the Soviet Union. In response to your inquiry of May 28th, I must formally inform you that subsequent reports received by the Central Committee in Moscow have fully confirmed the results of the aforementioned investigation.</p>
<p>As for the legal aspects of this issue, according to general principles of international law, since the Heilongjiang River is a border, both neighboring countries have the right to apply their laws and regulations to the river section between their border lines and the riverbanks. According to the Soviet Union's decree on border defense promulgated on June 15, 1927, and the regulations of the Republic, Article 625 of Regulation No. 62 of 1927, the Heilongjiang border guard has the right to order the "Di Cheng" vessel, which illegally and for a long time approached the Soviet shore, and continuously photographed the Soviet shoreline, especially the border guard posts, to stop sailing. According to Article 2 of the law of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic promulgated on February 23, 1929, photography in the border area is prohibited without special permission. According to Article 35 of the aforementioned law promulgated on June 15, 1927, since the vessel engaged in illegal activities, "after firing a blank shot and two live shots as a warning," the border guards had full authority to use their weapons. However, the Soviet border guards, obeying the instructions of their superiors to avoid any actions that might cause disputes with neighboring countries unless absolutely necessary, did not use the powers granted by the aforementioned articles. Even the news published by Japanese military officer Captain Taki of the "Di Cheng" vessel in the Harbin Daily News on May 26th (Captain Taki was on the "Di Cheng" vessel when the incident occurred) has shown that the Soviet border guards repeatedly shouted loudly and fired blank shots as signals to the vessel approaching the Soviet shore. The vessel only sailed away from the Soviet shore and towards the Manchukuo shore after the crew showed that they completely disregarded the border guards' signals and after several live shots were fired upwards towards the vessel's smokestack.</p>
<p>During the investigation, all the border guards provided their testimonies, proving that none of the border guards directly fired at the vessel. As for your claim that one person died and one person was injured on the "Di Cheng" vessel, I must draw your attention to the following facts: According to the statement made by Japanese Ambassador Ota to Deputy Foreign Affairs Commissioner Stomonyakov on May 22nd, the "Di Cheng" vessel approached the Soviet shore because bandits on the Manchukuo shore were firing at the vessel. At the same time, the news revealed by the Heihe Minbao newspaper in the Heihe area on May 18th also confirms the above statement. The newspaper stated that the vessel was shot at by bandits 25 versts (each verst equals 1.067 kilometers) from the confluence of the Songhua River and the Heilongjiang River, and near the Manchukuo village of Tushiqi on the Songhua River, resulting in the death of two crew members. The vessel began sailing upstream the Heilongjiang River to Heihe after the incident with the Soviet border guards in the Bizhuang River area on May 12th. Therefore, the bandit shooting incident mentioned by the Heihe newspaper clearly occurred before the "Di Cheng" incident with the Soviet border guards, and the so-called incident with the Soviet border guards is actually the shooting incident mentioned by Ambassador Ota. The conclusion drawn from these facts is that your statement, based on the report of the captain of the "Di Cheng" vessel, that one person died and one person was injured was not the result of Soviet border guards firing, but, as reported by the Heihe newspaper, the victims of bandit shooting. However, if the Manchukuo side has new materials, the Soviet side will never refuse to send personnel to thoroughly investigate the matter further.</p>
<p>The incidents between the Soviet border guards and the three Manchukuo vessels were all the result of the vessels' illegal actions, such as breaking through the Soviet border and systematically photographing Soviet border guard posts. At the same time, they absolutely refused to heed the signals and warnings given by the Soviet shore guards in previous incidents. The Soviet government deeply regrets this. The Soviet government believes that such incidents are detrimental to the friendship between the two neighboring countries, and therefore believes that both sides should take all possible steps to prevent such incidents from happening again in the future. Although the above three Manchukuo vessel incidents were purely the result of their breaking through the Soviet border and their illegal activities near the Soviet riverbanks, the Soviet Union has reiterated strict orders to border agencies to be prudent and strictly abide by the law, and to order that weapons not be used unless absolutely necessary. At the same time, the Soviet government has taken note of the fact that in order to prevent incidents involving Manchukuo vessels in Soviet territorial waters from happening again, the Manchukuo authorities should first firmly and resolutely order vessels flying the Manchukuo flag not to break through the Soviet border, and that in Soviet territorial waters, they must respect Soviet laws and regulations. The Soviet government hopes that future negotiations between the Heilongjiang navigation authorities and the Manchukuo navigation organizations on technical issues related to Heilongjiang navigation can also promote and guarantee the normal operation of navigation on the Heilongjiang River, and that both sides can respect each other's laws and regulations in their respective territorial waters.

<h3 id="e27">Debate Rages Among Nations over Whether to Adjourn the Disarmament Conference <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Henderson Urges Germany to Return to the Conference; Litvinov Presents a Resolution</p>
<p>(Geneva) At the executive meeting of the Disarmament Conference at 3:40 PM today, the issue of whether the Disarmament Conference should adjourn immediately or continue discussions and broaden its objectives was debated. It was expected that there would be a fierce war of words between the two factions. Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov, representing those in favor of continuing discussions, spoke first, presenting a resolution containing seven points: (1) The General Committee should immediately study the issue of mutual assistance pacts and the definition of "aggressor states." (2) The Disarmament Conference should immediately become a permanent peace conference and continue its work. (3) The conference, entrusted with this task, should maintain the same relationship with the League of Nations and continue to work to establish a compromise on a convention to reduce or limit armaments. (4) The conference should seek coordination or other plans to create new guarantees of security. (5) The conference should establish preventive plans to prevent armed conflicts. (6) The conference should supervise the implementation of the convention and the resolutions of the conference. (7) The conference should consult on countermeasures in the event of a breach of the treaty. The above seven points, as far as is currently known, will be supported by France, Poland, the Little Entente, and the Balkan countries. Britain, Italy, and Belgium are in favor of adjournment, and the United States is roughly the same. Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson, in summarizing the general situation at the meeting this afternoon, strongly urged the need to invite Germany back to the conference for discussions, and suggested a suitable method to entrust the executive branch with the task of reconciling differences. French Foreign Minister Barthou spoke sharply, saying that if Henderson's suggestion contained new avenues, he would oppose this principle unless he was carrying something in his luggage. It should be known that British disarmament salesman Eden had already traveled to many countries without success. What he regrets is that he is not yet proficient in the language of Geneva, so he is easily misunderstood. But he feels that many important proposals have been submitted to the executive branch, ready for discussion. For this reason, he opposes adjournment. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Bureau of the Disarmament Conference will meet this afternoon to discuss the agenda of the General Assembly. According to reliable sources, the decision has been made to form a special committee in addition to the original two committees of the General Assembly to deal with security and disarmament issues. This approach is satisfactory to both Britain and France, and the Disarmament Conference can get a long rest. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to a London dispatch received by Le Matin, some members of the British Cabinet intend to request Foreign Secretary Simon to return to Geneva to attend the Disarmament General Committee at today's emergency Cabinet meeting. The newspaper also said that Simon does not intend to serve as the chief British representative in Geneva again, but it is generally believed that those in the Cabinet who are less in favor of a hard-line policy may prevail and order Foreign Secretary Simon to return to Geneva with instructions that are slightly milder than the attitude of last week (referring to Simon's speech at the Disarmament General Committee on May 30). (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Soviet Foreign Commissioner Litvinov, accompanied by Roshanbay, First Secretary of the Soviet Embassy in France, held a long meeting with French Foreign Minister Barthou today. According to Litvinov's aides, they have not heard of Litvinov going to Paris in Geneva. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>(London) The situation of the Disarmament Conference may be raised for discussion in today's House of Commons meeting. Several members of the House of Commons will ask Foreign Secretary Simon to attend and explain. The Morning Post commented on this matter, saying that Cabinet members have quite different opinions on the disarmament issue, and that Simon's recent two speeches in Geneva show wavering policy on the issue of German rearmament, which can be seen in his words. It also said that former Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Eden was promoted to Lord Privy Seal for his contribution to the Disarmament Conference, and has now been promoted to Privy Councilor, which has a deeper meaning. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>(London) The Daily Telegraph commented on Soviet Foreign Commissioner Litvinov's "Security Plan," saying that the plan is undoubtedly the center for creating a new alliance between some European countries, such as France, Russia, Turkey, and the Balkan countries. This group will be very powerful, but it is an overstatement to say that Britain will become isolated, because the United States, Italy, Belgium, and Sweden and Norway will not join, so there are still many neutral countries, so there is no need to worry about isolation. If the plan is realized, those who oppose it will also naturally unite, so Europe</p>
<p>The Geneva Newsletter said that the most powerful proposal at present is the claim of the Turkish delegation that the current urgent task of the Disarmament Conference is not disarmament, but security. Russia and France have decided to have the General Assembly discuss this claim regardless of whether Britain agrees or not. The truth of what is happening in Geneva now is that France and Russia, with the support of the Little Entente and the Balkan countries, are trying to get rid of the dangerous words of disarmament and restore the previous military alliance system (National Telegram, 4th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The International Saar Governing Commission's recommendation to hold a plebiscite on January 13 next year has been passed by the Administrative Council today. The report first details the current situation in the Saar region, and states that although there are some political movements there, the plebiscite scheduled for January in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles should proceed smoothly. The report was drafted by Mr. Knox, the British Chairman of the Governing Commission. Before it was passed, anti-Hitler elements strongly opposed it, because they believed that a free and confidential reliable vote could not be held under the terrorist activities implemented by the German National Socialist Party, so it would be better to postpone it. After the report was passed, the Administrative Council stated that the League of Nations will proceed cautiously with the voting plan, because a slight oversight could easily lead to a Franco-German war. The Saar people's self-determination vote has three options: (1) Maintain the autonomous political system established by the Treaty of Versailles; (2) Merge with France; (3) Merge with Germany. Political observers today stated that the results of the plebiscite are now more difficult to predict than before. France's plan to appease the Saar people has not achieved much, but the people may not be completely in favor of merging with Germany, because there are many socialists and anti-Hitler elements in the area who are deeply afraid that their lives will be endangered after the merger. Therefore, there is a good chance that the voting results will maintain the autonomous system, which is especially desired by France, but others believe that the people will demand to merge with Germany. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council held a closed meeting this morning, and will change to an open meeting when discussing the Saar agreement. The League of Nations has no doubt that the Administrative Council will directly accept the Saar report without modification. However, French Foreign Minister Barthou will give a speech at that time, and the Administrative Council will also appoint the Saar People's Voting Committee. The committee will be established on July 1. The most likely candidates are Professor Beren of the University of Montreal, Director-General Roda of Sweden, and Administrative Commissioner de Puf of the Netherlands. Ms. Hua of the United States is said to be hired as an expert advisor. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>(Paris) A demonstration occurred in Saarbrücken, the capital of the Saar region, last night. The wife of Socialist leader Brown was insulted by National Socialist demonstrators. Le Petit Parisien reported on this matter today, saying that Brown, who is currently in Geneva, received the news and returned to Saarbrücken from Geneva today. Before leaving, he sent a long letter to French Foreign Minister Barthou, reporting the insult to his wife and saying that it is urgent and cannot be delayed for the French Foreign Minister to pay attention to it, take serious measures, and maintain order in the Saar. Le Petit Parisien also said that it is now certain that the League of Nations Administrative Council will hold a meeting tomorrow and issue a solemn warning to the National Socialist elements who instigated the disturbances, hoping that they will realize their mistakes. According to a Saarbrücken dispatch published by Le Petit Parisien, the Saar region's Communist Party has finally decided on its attitude towards the 1935 plebiscite.</p>

Tomorrow, the Chinese ambassador to the UK will accompany Yang Jie to meet with the British Secretary of State for War. On Saturday and Sunday, the Chinese military delegation will lay a wreath at the European War Memorial. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Until recently, the Communist Party leaders put forward slogans to their members, advocating that the Saar region should belong to the German Soviet Republic. However, the Treaty of Versailles stipulates that the plebiscite only has three options: maintaining the current system, belonging to Germany, or belonging to France. If votes are cast according to the Communist Party's slogans, they will be invalid. Therefore, the Communist Party, considering this point, has issued a proclamation ordering Saar Communist Party members to vote to maintain the current system. This decision is quite important because, in the Saar region, the Communist Party is the largest political party besides the old central party. In previous Saar parliamentary elections, the Communist Party has always obtained more than 60,000 votes. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The German guarantee issue for the Saar people's plebiscite to determine their own future on January 13th next year has been clearly stipulated in a declaration issued by the foreign ministers of France and Germany. The declaration has been sent to Mr. Aloisi, the Chairman of the Saar Territory Commission. Germany declared that it would not exert any direct or indirect pressure on the voting people. Regardless of the voters' attitude, Germany would never take retaliatory measures or coercion. If any dispute arises between Germany and any member of the League of Nations Council regarding the interpretation or implementation of this guarantee, Germany is willing to submit such dispute to the Hague International Court of Justice for adjudication. Germany also allows the League of Nations Commission to establish a Supreme Court for a period of one year after the vote. (National Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) At the meeting of the League of Nations Council on Monday morning, in addition to discussing the border incident between Hungary and Yugoslavia, it will also make a resolution on the Saar region's plebiscite issue. Regarding the preparations for the 1935 Saar region plebiscite, the League of Nations Council previously organized a three-person committee, chaired by Mr. Aloisi, the Italian representative, to be responsible for research. Subsequently, after consultations with the foreign ministers of France and Germany by the three-person committee, an agreement on the preparations for the Saar plebiscite was established. The three-person committee has drafted a report, listing the clauses of this agreement. The report has been distributed to the delegations of various countries attending the Council and to the press today. The report contains four draft resolutions, all of which will be voted on at the Council meeting on Monday. The contents of these draft resolutions are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Resolution on the date of the plebiscite: The plebiscite is scheduled to be held on Sunday, January 13, 1935. The Council reserves the right to consider, at an appropriate time, certain methods, so that the Saar residents without voting rights may also enjoy the benefits of the commitments made by the governments of France and Germany to the voters. The Council shall supervise the implementation of these commitments, as the implementation of these commitments is a major condition for the plebiscite.</p>
<p>(2) Resolution on the establishment of the Plebiscite Commission: The resolution proposes the establishment of a Plebiscite Commission and determines its due powers for the organization, management, and supervision of the plebiscite. For matters related to the plebiscite that are not within the prescribed powers of the Commission, the Commission may propose methods and request the League of Nations Council to approve them, or, in urgent situations, request the Council Committee to approve them. The Plebiscite Commission shall consist of three members, appointed by the Council. Another expert shall be appointed by the Council as the technical advisor to the Commission. The Saar Territory Government Committee shall prepare to assist the Plebiscite Commission and pay attention at all times to ensure that the Commission receives all necessary assistance and supplies from the Saar public authorities.</p>
<p>(3) Regulations on the results of the plebiscite and the establishment of the Plebiscite Court: The Council shall adopt rules stipulating that the results of the vote shall be decided jointly in each locality. The Council will also decide to establish a Plebiscite Court and eight sub-courts in each polling district. Lawsuits regarding voter registration and criminal cases related to the plebiscite shall be tried by this court. The Plebiscite Commission shall determine the date on which the court begins to serve.</p>
<p>(4) Special resolution on maintaining public order: The Council allows the Saar Government Committee to increase the number of police officers if necessary, by recruiting them from outside Saar residents or transferring necessary police personnel. The Council is prepared to approve this. The three-person committee believes that it is beneficial for the Council to request League of Nations member states to recruit personnel to serve as police and local constables in the Saar region for the convenience of the Saar Government Committee. Regarding the expenses required for the plebiscite, the Saar Government Committee shall allocate 1 million francs before July 1, and the governments of France and Germany shall each allocate 5 million francs.</p>
<p>In addition to the above draft resolutions, the report of the three-person committee also includes a letter from Baron Aloisi, Chairman of the Committee, to the governments of France and Germany, requesting the two governments to solemnly declare to the Council their firm will to fulfill all obligations arising from the treaty, and to present the government measures and special procedures prepared for the implementation of these obligations. Subsequently, French Foreign Minister Barthou and German Foreign Minister Neurath jointly prepared a letter on June 2, replying to Baron Aloisi. The letter stated that the two governments agreed to eliminate all kinds of oppression that could hinder the freedom of voting, and that the people entitled to vote in the Saar region would not be prosecuted or discriminated against because of their political attitude during the League of Nations' rule. In addition, beneficial measures will be taken to prohibit the actions of nationals who violate the above commitments. If any dispute arises between France, Germany, and a country attending the League of Nations Council regarding the implementation of the above commitments, the governments of the countries concerned agree to submit the dispute to the Hague International Court of Arbitration for resolution. Furthermore, the governments of France and Germany recognize a transitional period of one year from the date of the establishment of the Saar region's ruling system. During the transitional period, the Senior Plebiscite Court will continue to exist. Anyone entitled to vote in the Saar region, who has suffered oppression or retaliation due to their political attitude related to the plebiscite during the League of Nations' rule of the Saar, may file a complaint with the Senior Court. In the event of criminal and administrative litigation outside the Saar territory, anyone entitled to vote in the Saar may request the Plebiscite Court to determine whether the litigation violates the country's commitments, etc. In addition, the report of the three-person committee also pointed out that there is obviously no distinction between men and women and nationality in the right to vote in the Saar region. Anyone who is 20 years old on the voting date and has resided in the Saar region since June 28, 1919, has the right to vote. (Havas, 4th)</p>

<h3 id="e32">New French Military Exercises <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) Previously, French reservists were convened separately in various localities during exercise periods, and no large-scale exercises were ever held with many troops gathered in one place. According to Le Journal, the method of reservist exercises will be greatly changed this year. From September 15th to 30th, 15,000 reservists will be formed into a division, fully equipped for wartime, just like during mobilization. The exercise site will be in the Champagne province, and the commander of the exercise will be General Bretelats, commander of the Paris garrison. He made the following remarks to a reporter from Le Journal: "This exercise is a partial mobilization method, which has never been tested before. This plan has been in place since 1926, but it has been delayed for eight years due to lack of funding. As you know, when the European War began in 1914, General Joffre lacked fully trained reservist troops, while the German reservists mobilized for combat had received training as complete as that of active-duty soldiers. After the lessons of that year, we cannot but pay attention to the reservists. We can rely on How many reservists are there in our country? After the exercise in September this year, we will know." Le Journal concluded that the gathering of 15,000 reservists for exercises should not be regarded as France flexing its muscles. "When the situation on the east bank of the Rhine is getting tense, we must prepare for a rainy day in case of emergency. Our national defense organization is based on trained reservists, so we must first test the combat capabilities of our reservists." (Havas, 4th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The International Labour Bureau conference opened at 11 o'clock this morning and elected French Senator Godart as chairman. The procedures of the conference are (1) the Saar region issue; (2) the election of a committee to protect workers' interests. (Reuters, 4th) (Geneva) The Labour Conference opened here today. Representatives from 46 countries, including the United Kingdom and the United States, are participating in the conference, and former French Labour Minister Godart was elected chairman of this International Labour Conference. Mr. Godart is also one of the initiators of the conference. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) A proposal to increase the staff of the International Labour Bureau from 24 to 32 was submitted at today's conference by representatives of Denmark and Argentina. Argentina also requested the approval of the amendment to Article 393 of the Treaty of Versailles. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The International Labour Conference opens here tomorrow, and issues closely related to the world's workers will be discussed. 50 countries have sent representatives to participate, including the United States. The United States is not a member of the League of Nations, and will send official observers from its labor, capital, and government sectors to attend. Labour leaders are deeply convinced that the United States will soon join the International Labour Bureau. There are still two major industrial countries that have not joined the International Labour Bureau, namely Germany and Soviet Russia. Germany withdrew last year, and Soviet Russia has never joined. Important figures in the International Labour Bureau are deeply afraid that after Japan's economic aggression is severely attacked at this conference, Japan may withdraw. The Japanese side does not deny the possibility of this, but says that this move depends entirely on whether the Japanese representatives can overturn various rumors from the outside world. When the conference opens, representatives from various countries will review the work of the International Labour Bureau. At this time, the British representatives may rise up to criticize Japanese wages. In addition to this, there are no other points in the agenda that attack Japan. The first step of the conference is to re-elect the administrative staff. There are currently 24 administrative staff, of which 12 are government representatives, 6 are worker representatives, and 6 are capital representatives. It is now planned to increase the number to 32, "16 government representatives, 8 labor and capital representatives each," so that countries outside of Europe, such as South America, can also send representatives. The main agenda item is the plan to alleviate world unemployment. The International Labour Bureau knows that the United Kingdom spent £107,000,000 to help the unemployed last year, and the United States spent about US$1,000,000,000, and both countries are willing to shorten the weekly working hours to 40 hours and promote large-scale public works to reduce unemployment. Supporters of the 40-hour work system will urge the final reading of the 40-hour work system draft, which has been discussed before, but it is not believed that it can be passed due to British opposition to the conference. Labour experts said that this draft does not conflict with the new American business rules, so although the American representatives have no voting rights, they are expected to support this draft. French representatives will call for international action on public works as a way to alleviate unemployment. The International Labour Bureau has recently applied to various countries to build public works to reduce unemployment. Although Germany is no longer a member, the International Labour Bureau has given much encouragement to the effects of German public works. According to official reports, German public works cost a total of 100,000,000 marks, of which 57% has been paid for by the public works themselves. There are three costs: (1) the reduction of unemployment relief costs; (2) the increase of the unemployment insurance fund; (3) the increase of tax revenue. It is said that those who oppose reducing working hours and building public works will express their views at this conference. British workers support this plan. This plan was originally proposed by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. The conference will also give a final reading to the draft on unemployment insurance and other assistance to unemployed workers. American representatives are particularly interested in this draft because the United States does not have this labour law. The meeting will last for two weeks. Government and labour representatives are in an equal position in the conference. (National News Agency, 3rd)</p>

<p>(New York) President Roosevelt returned to Washington today to face the most difficult issue under the National Recovery Act. 300,000 steel and lead workers are demanding (1) recognition of collective bargaining; (2) a 30-hour work week; and (3) higher standard wages, claiming that if these demands are not accepted, they will strike on June 15. Many of the workers' leaders are radical elements. Even if the steelworkers' union cancels the strike because it has the right to participate in the Steel Labour Bureau, other workers' leaders may still have to resist.

<p>(London) The British government has instructed British Ambassador to the US, Lindsay, to send a note to the White House stating the British government's views on the war debt due on June 15. This note was sent from the London Foreign Office to the ambassador to the US several days ago. Because it had to wait for President Roosevelt's message to Congress regarding the war debt, it was delayed in delivery. It is now sent to the US government in the original text drafted a few days ago, without any modification. It can be seen that the British government believes that President Roosevelt's message does not contain any factors that would cause Britain to change its position. (Hagans, 4th)</p>

<h3 id="e42">Chaos in Japanese Politics: Takahashi Plays a Crucial Role; No Suitable Person to Form a Cabinet <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Saito Cabinet is now quietly observing the state of government transition, but this quiet observation will be broken by the report of Justice Minister Koyama on the Kuroda issue, and the timing is gradually approaching. Although opinions on the political situation vary due to different positions, the view that a political change is coming is completely unanimous. The advance and retreat of the Saito Cabinet will be triggered by the resignation of Finance Minister Takahashi. (Daily News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The political situation has temporarily eased due to the death of Marshal Togo, but behind-the-scenes activities in various aspects are still intense. According to the observations of influential figures in the Peerage Council, the truth about the Kuroda Vice-Minister issue is gradually becoming clear. Prime Minister Saito, Finance Minister Takahashi, and Navy Minister Yamamoto also seem to have decided to advance and retreat. Therefore, although the government is working hard to promote the reconstruction of the cabinet and continue to serve, the general trend does not allow its existence. If the content of Justice Minister Koyama's report on the Kuroda issue has the nature of malfeasance, then Finance Minister Takahashi will naturally resign. Takahashi's resignation is the fatal blow to the current cabinet. Therefore, the political change will occur approximately 15 days after the Koyama report. Although Governor Ugaki has the strength to succeed the cabinet, the Navy's statement the other day has some impact on Ugaki. Although Count Kiyoura is an important figure in the political world, he must travel to avoid the cold every winter due to his old age, which is inconvenient for attending parliament. Therefore, whether the Kiyoura cabinet theory is powerful is quite questionable. As for the Hiranuma cabinet theory, it does not attract public attention at present. In short, Japan currently has no suitable person to succeed the cabinet. It is still appropriate to regard Ugaki as the most powerful person to succeed the cabinet. On the political party side, they are taking advantage of the high tide of "political change is coming" to carry out activities. The Seiyukai, with President Suzuki as the center, plans to realize the cooperative cabinet of the Seiyukai and Minseito parties. If the imperial order to form a cabinet does not fall on Suzuki, then it opposes any cabinet theory. The Kuwabara faction is quite openly supporting the Kiyoura cabinet, and the Tokonami faction is also connected with Kuwabara, and is also in contact with the Minseito party, but their attitude is not very clear and they adopt opportunism. The Seiyukai's internal affairs are so complicated. If a political change comes, internal disturbances will inevitably occur. The Minseito party believes that the emergence of a political party cabinet is completely hopeless, and has no intention of realizing the joint cabinet theory with the Seiyukai, but Ugaki has always had a close relationship with the Minseito party, so its leaders secretly support Ugaki in winning power.

<h3 id="e97">Sichuan Army Thoroughly Suppresses Communist Bandits <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Finding Ways to Attack the Mind, Causing the Bandits' Internal Collapse; Grasping the People, Cutting off the Bandits' Lifeline. Chengdu Correspondence: Recently, the Communist bandit forces in northern Sichuan have gradually become exhausted. The bandit leader, Xu Xiangqian, once fell ill due to resentment, and since then his nature has become even more violent. He is stubborn and opinionated in everything, and the divisive forces within his ranks are spreading more and more fiercely. Although he frequently launches surprise attacks on the positions of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 6th Route Armies of the National Army, attempting to break the encirclement, he has suffered repeated heavy blows due to the strict precautions taken by each army. The 3rd Route Army recently captured Zhou Ziming, a platoon leader of the bandits, and others. According to their confessions, "When the bandit Xu entered Sichuan, he led four divisions of men. After occupying Tongjiang, he reorganized them into the pseudo 4th, 9th, 30th, and 31st and 4th Armies. He Wei, the commander of the pseudo 9th Army, was wounded and died in Yilong from shrapnel from a bomb, and was buried in Yingge Mouth. Most of the old bandits have died. The bandit army adopts a three-three system, but each regiment has only 600 men, and each gun is equipped with six clips of ammunition. Recently, they have been blockaded by the government army, and ammunition is scarce. Only the old bandits have a dozen bullets each, and salt is the most scarce."</p>
<p>According to headquarters intelligence, the 5th Route Army has divided its forces in recent days to assist the 4th and 6th Routes, engaging in fierce battles with the bandits many times, killing many bandits. There have been daily reports of bandits at the front bringing their weapons and surrendering. Liu Xiang has issued orders to all routes to widely open the path to surrender, not to investigate the past. Yesterday, Xu Yaoqing, commander of the 5th Route Army, sent a long telegram to Liu, the commander-in-chief, all commanders, and the Pacification Committee, stating his opinions on bandit suppression, saying that if bandits are to be eliminated as soon as possible, military and political measures must be combined to be effective. He recounted various facts and experiences he had gained at the front as evidence, and every word had a source and was very valuable. Therefore, I have excerpted a summary of it as follows: "Since the joint forces of all routes began suppressing bandits, more than eight months have passed without complete success. Although officers and soldiers have fought hard and repeatedly defeated the fierce bandits, the bandit area has shrunk, and their strength has become concentrated. Recently, they have relied on natural barriers to resist stubbornly. If we do not find ways to attack their minds and cause their internal collapse, relying solely on military force will make it difficult to eliminate them in the short term. This is why Chairman Chiang has instructed that bandit suppression should be three parts military and seven parts political. I lead troops to suppress bandits and have fought fiercely until now. I deeply feel that military and political measures must be combined to have any hope of eliminating them. Recently, I investigated the recovered areas and found that there is no political clean-up being carried out. Everything is merely superficial. We must know that we must prescribe the right medicine for the illness without delay, so as to avoid future troubles. I would like to briefly state to you gentlemen what I have seen and heard. The Red bandits purely use deceptive means to lure the people, and they fully utilize ignorant villagers and local bullies to serve as chairmen, representatives, or committee members. They try their best to get them to implicate local wealthy gentlemen, civil servants, and middle-class families, confiscate their property, and kill their families, so that they will bear grudges against each other. They slightly divide the land and give it to the poor to show their favor. Furthermore, they select the cunning ones among the poor and accuse them of reactionary crimes or secretly protecting wealthy gentlemen, killing one or two of them to show their power. Therefore, the general poor people all follow them to the death, not daring to leave or rebel without exerting themselves. They also order them to break family relationships and search and kill them first. All the 'reddened' poor people in the recovered bandit areas are afraid of being investigated by the government and even more afraid of revenge from their fellow villagers, so they have no choice but to follow the bandits. Once they are incorporated into the bandit ranks, they are trained day and night, or they are told that the government troops will brutally kill them if they surrender, to strengthen their resolve. They also fabricate rumors, not mentioning how Chengdu and Chongqing are doing, but saying how Dongchuan is doing, and how the Red Army is winning, exaggerating and exaggerating to frighten them. Therefore, those who are forced to become bandits know that the Communist bandits are brutal and inhumane, and they are eager to escape, but they are afraid of bearing grudges in their hometowns, having no home to return to, and they are also misled by the government troops' brutal killings, so they do not dare to surrender. There is no way forward or backward, and they only seek to die quickly. Although the army tries its best to spread propaganda, they are still facing each other and do not dare to believe it deeply. As for the leaflets distributed by airplanes, many bandits are illiterate and are afraid of their tyrannical power, so they do not dare to pick them up and look at them, as if they are lost in a fog and do not know what is going on. Although there have been bandits surrendering in recent days, the number is very small. They all say that they wanted to escape and surrender long ago, but they were ultimately misled by the above situation and did not dare to try easily. Now that the various routes are encircling them, the bandit forces are exhausted, food is scarce, and the bandits' hearts are scattered. The best method for now is to have the counties and townships quickly form a joint public propaganda and security post-disaster committee to go to the front lines of the various armies, divisions, regiments, and brigades, and loudly proclaim to the bandits day and night that they are all fellow Sichuanese, why bother abandoning their wives and children and sacrificing themselves for the bandits, causing their society and families to be ruined? Furthermore, if the government troops advance to suppress them, they will either die from gunfire or be killed by the bandits. They should repent as soon as possible, either scatter and escape home, or bring their weapons and surrender. It is decided to issue certificates of protection and provide travel expenses to allow them to return alive. As for all kinds of grudges with the local people in the past, they will not be investigated. A deadline is set for them to return, otherwise, they will be regarded as willingly following the bandits and will not be tolerated, and their families will be investigated. If this can be done, the bandits' hearts will be scattered, and they will collapse immediately, so that the bandits will have no way to seize the people to create chaos, and it will not be difficult to eliminate them in one fell swoop. We must know that persuading the bandits is the way to clear them, and saving people is the way to save ourselves. I hope that you gentlemen will act quickly to achieve this."

<p>The county seat is located in Shenqiu Settlement. The Department of Civil Affairs sends personnel to prepare. Anqing Correspondence: Fuyang County in northern Anhui is vast, and the establishment of a new county seat has been brewing for a long time. Recently, the General Headquarters for Bandit Suppression in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, based on the request of the Sui Jing Commissioner's Office in Henan, military agencies, and local organizations, to establish a new county in the western territory of Fuyang, ordered the Anhui Provincial Government to investigate and report. Subsequently, the Anhui Provincial Government ordered Zang Dezhi, a member of the Department of Civil Affairs, to go to Fuyang to conduct an on-site survey and submit a report, which was reviewed and forwarded by the Department of Civil Affairs. It was considered that the western territory of Fuyang was far from the county seat, bordering Henan Province, and it was difficult to govern the banditry that had been rampant for many years. The establishment of a new county was in line with the outline of the administrative regional reorganization method promulgated by the Ministry. Therefore, three matters were carefully reviewed and approved: (1) For the sake of the situation and economy, the county seat was decided to be located in Shenqiu Settlement; (2) The area where the new county borders the northern section of Fuyang should still be bounded by the ancient ditch to conform to the natural terrain; (3) The name of the county was determined to be Linquan County. The matter was submitted to the 237th discussion meeting of the provincial government on May 29 and was approved. The preparations for the establishment of the county were also listed item by item, and Zhang Guohua, director of the second section of the fourth department of the Department of Civil Affairs, was appointed as the preparation officer for the establishment of the new county. He was ordered to immediately go and follow the resolutions and instructions of various methods, and cooperate with Fuyang County to quickly prepare and report. The preparation office was limited to be established before July 1, and all start-up fees and travel expenses were set at 1,000 yuan, and the monthly salary and office expenses were set at 800 yuan, and the Department of Finance was ordered to allocate funds. Anhui Province has recently transferred Yingshan to Hubei and newly established Huang Jia Shan and Liang Counties. Originally, there were a total of 61 counties. Now that a new county has been added in western Fuyang, the province governs a total of 62 counties. (4th)</p>

<p>Shantou Correspondence: Li Yangjing, commander of the Second Column of the Southern Route Bandit Suppression Army, was recently summoned to return to the province. Military affairs on the Fujian-Jiangxi border are presided over by Huang Renhuan. The Chen Zhang troops of the Second Independent Brigade are now stationed in various key passes in Shanghang and Yongding, forming a unified line with the advancing Central Army. The Zeng Youren Brigade is stationed in Xianchuitang, Zhaibei, and Yongping Village in Wuping. The Yan Yingyu Brigade is stationed in Yangjiaoying, Luotang, and Guikeng in the eastern part of Junmen Ridge. The Huang Yanzhen troops are on the front of Chengjiang Market in Junmen Ridge. The Huang Zhiwen troops are in Pangu Pass and Xunwu City. According to Huang Renhuan, the donations from various agencies of the First Group to aid Junmen Ridge have been remitted to the front. In addition to deploying troops defensively on the front line, the Guangdong Army is actively building a highway from Pingyuan to Chengjiang Luotang directly to Junmen. As for the post-bandit affairs in the newly recovered areas, they are handled jointly by the political training personnel of each division and local people: (1) compiling house numbers and household registrations, and organizing public sales offices for salt, kerosene, and rice; (2) compiling and eliminating the Communist Volunteer Army, and all Communist bandits who return to the new government are treated favorably; (3) implementing the Baojia system, implementing joint security. In May, our army occupied Luotian Qingxi, and all the Communist bandits retreated to the west bank of the Zhang River. The front line is peaceful. The Chaozhou and Meizhou circles held a consolation meeting on May 24 in Meixian, and on May 26, the representatives went to the front line of Pingyuan Xunwu to award flags and reward the various divisions and regiments.

<p>Thirteen sugar public warehouses are established in various prefectures. Sales operators and distributors are set up to promote sales. Guangzhou Correspondence: The Sugar Department of the Guangdong Provincial National Goods Promotion Office recently decided to implement a sugar control method for the purpose of promoting domestic products, as the state-run sugar factories in Huizhou Panyu Xinzhao have been established one after another and can produce 2,000 dan of sugar per month (100 jin per dan). The method will be implemented on the 1st of this month. According to the method, 20,000 dan of refined white sugar will be prepared for exclusive sales. Ten well-known sugar shops will be selected as sugar operators for the whole province to form a joint office, and a deposit of 40,000 yuan must be paid as a guarantee that they will comply with the regulations and promote sales. The Sugar Department will establish thirteen sugar public warehouses in various prefectural towns, and the sugar operators will set up 240 distributors within the scope of each public warehouse to act as agents for sales. Each distributor must sell at least 100 dan of cane sugar per month and pay a deposit of 300 yuan. The money will be deposited in the bank and earn interest at 6% per annum. The agency sales period is set at four months as a trial period. If the operation is properly handled, the contract may be renewed. If the distributor can sell 100 dan of sugar per month, a deposit of 300 yuan must be paid as a guarantee that the sugar industry will be promoted in accordance with the regulations of the provincial government and that private sugar will not be bought or sold. Each prefectural public warehouse is managed by a director appointed by the National Goods Promotion Office, who is responsible for all warehouse affairs such as sugar storage and shipment, and supervises the business operators and agents within the scope of the warehouse to promote the sale of state-run cane sugar and the conclusion of business matters. The joint office of various sugar merchants in the provincial capital was established today (the 1st), and the various regulations of the National Goods Promotion Office on sugar control will also be implemented from this day. As for the sugar business control rules, in general, if sugar produced by sugar factories in this province is transported out of the factory, a factory exit permit must be obtained from the Sugar Department of the National Goods Promotion Office before it can be shipped out, otherwise it will be regarded as private transportation. If imported sugar is imported, the operator must obtain an import permit from the Sugar Department before it can be imported. Sugar stored in public warehouses after obtaining a permit must apply for a transport and sales permit before it can be transported. If imported sugar and sugar from this province are to be transported out of the province, an exit permit must also be obtained. From the date of establishment of the Sugar Department, sugar stored by sugar merchants must be registered, and a delivery note must be issued for retail sugar of more than five jin, otherwise it will be regarded as private sugar. The quantity of modified imported sugar exceeding 300 jin must still be stored in the public warehouse. Anyone who commits private transportation will be dealt with in accordance with the regulations of the Customs Anti-Smuggling Office of the Finance Department. (June 1)</p>

<p>The Wu-Bai Road is scheduled to open to traffic. The Tun-Jing section will start construction soon. Wuyuan Correspondence: The highways in the border area of the three provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Anhui, including the main lines from Jingde to Leping Wannian, Qu County to Changshan Kaihua, and Tunxi via Qimen to Jingde, except for the Jing-Tun line which has not yet been built, the Jiangxi and Zhejiang lines have been built and opened to traffic. However, the two major sections connecting Anhui Province from Wuyuan to Dexing and Baishaguan to Wuyuan were previously slow in construction, which prevented the highways in the border area of the three provinces of Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Anhui from being connected. Chairman Chiang, recognizing that the construction of the Wu-Bai and Wu-De sections is of utmost importance to the transportation of the three provinces, repeatedly ordered Zeng Yangfu, director of the Zhejiang Construction Department, to form the Zhejiang-Jiangxi-Anhui Border Highway Engineering Office to actively speed up construction. Since construction began five months ago, although the mountains and rocks are dangerous and the project is huge, the progress is still fast. All the bridges, culverts, and road surfaces have been completed in the middle of this month. Director Zeng of the Highway Office not only reported to Chairman Chiang by telegram, but also made early preparations for the opening of the Wu-Bai Road, and scheduled the opening ceremony to be held on June 4 at the station outside the West Gate of Wucheng. Zeng Yangfu, director of the Zhejiang Construction Department and director of the Highway Office, and Zhao Guantao, commander of the four provinces' garrison, will all come to Wuyuan to participate. County Magistrate Liu has been preparing everything, and on the previous day, he led Jiang Youbai and other members of the Highway Committee to inspect the Wu-Bai Road, and ordered the unfinished projects to be completed before June 4, so as to open to traffic as scheduled. From then on, transportation in the three provinces will become much more convenient. As for the two main lines from Tunxi to Jingde and the Tun-Yin section of the Wu-Yin Road, the surveying has been completed and construction will begin soon. (May 31)</p>
<h3 id="e105">General Situation of Drug Distribution in Jiangsu Province <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>For six years, the poisonous fog has filled the province. In addition to opium, red pills are the most common. Zhenjiang News: The ban on opium in Jiangsu Province, from the second half of the 17th year to June of the 27th year, in these six years, the initial period was the period when opium was prevalent. The sources were the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the coastal ports, and the areas bordering Shandong, Henan, and Anhui. At that time, anesthetic drugs were only found in Yixing and Liyang. After the 19th year, the power gradually extended to the counties of Nantong and Rudong in northern Jiangsu. The popularity of drug pills is no less than that in southern Jiangsu. Heroin is also increasing in the Xuhai area, especially red pills, which are the most common. The manufacturing institutions for these red pills initially sought refuge in concessions, but have recently gradually moved inland. Those who are particularly cunning set up machines in boats and travel around, secretly manufacturing and selling them. Unscrupulous military police also provide protection from them. As a result, the scourge of drugs has spread and cannot be controlled. Currently, this province adopts a gradual policy for opium addicts, ordering them to gradually reduce the amount each year until it is completely banned in four years. For drug offenders, strict measures are used, and manufacturers and traffickers are punished with extreme penalties, and addicts are also dealt with by military law. All regulations and methods have been submitted to Chairman Chiang for approval and implementation. Recently, the Interim Regulations on Strictly Prohibiting Highly Addictive Drugs have been promulgated. The provincial and county opium prohibition committees will also be established one after another. (4th)</p>

<p>In Nanxiang Town, Jiading County, a New Life Movement lantern festival was held from the 1st, which was very lively. Qian Jinsheng, an employee of the Stamp Department of the Shanghai Postal Administration, led his mother, Huang, and wife, Lai, to Xiang. At about 8:00 p.m., they were watching under the lantern shed at Xianghua Bridge in Zhongshi. Xing Longnian, a soldier from the sixth squadron of the Shanghai Security Team stationed at the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Station in the town, also went to Xianghua Bridge to watch the lanterns. He caught sight of Lai and immediately stepped forward to tease her. He repeatedly groped Lai up and down in the crowd. Lai scolded him, and Xing retorted with insults. Lai's husband, Qian Jinsheng, stepped forward to negotiate, and Xing hit him with the leather strap he was holding. Lai stepped forward to protect him and was kicked multiple times in the lower body. Lai was six months pregnant and immediately fainted. The onlookers shouted to stop him, but Xing hit them indiscriminately with his leather belt. The crowd was furious and beat Xing into an injury. Qian, fearing trouble, tried his best to dissuade them and ordered his son, Huang Xiangsheng, and others to twist Xing and help Lai to the town's public security bureau to request a ruling. Wang Xingyuan, the acting director of the branch bureau, at the request of Zhao Xianzhang, the squadron leader of the security team, transferred the injured Xing Longnian to the Shanghai Railway Hospital for treatment. It was heard that the injury was not minor. Qian Jinsheng, Qian Lai, Qian Huang, Huang Xiangsheng, and other eight people were escorted to the county public security bureau the next morning. According to the previous situation, Huang Xiangsheng and others all confessed that they had not beaten the soldiers. Lai's abdomen was painful, and she was mentally exhausted, which was not without danger. Director Xue immediately transferred the case to the county government for trial.</p>

<p>The autonomous regions in this county are now ordered to be merged into eight districts. The location of the district offices will remain unchanged, except for the first district office. The first district office was originally located in the urban area and is now planned to be moved to Beitang, which has been approved by the Civil Affairs Department. Yesterday afternoon (the 3rd), County Magistrate Xu convened a meeting of township chiefs at the first district office to consult on district affairs. The township chiefs questioned the relocation of the district office to Beitang. County Magistrate Xu expressed a remedial measure, establishing an office of the first district office in the urban area, but the township chiefs requested that the district office be established in the urban area because there was no legal basis for the district office to set up an office. However, Xu said that it had been approved by the Civil Affairs Department and could not be approved. The township chiefs then submitted their resignation letters to County Magistrate Xu, and the meeting ended without result.</p>

<p>The Minfeng Paper Mill in Jiaxing Jiaoli Street has been discharging sewage for days, causing residents of Dongzha Town to be unable to draw drinking water, resulting in disputes. On the morning of the 3rd, the shops in the town went on strike one after another due to lack of a solution. At the same time, many reactionary slogans were found in the town. The water and land police sent personnel to persuade the shops to open and took the merchants Jiang Shirong, Gao Zhenyuan, Wang Shouguan and others to the county government and placed them under house arrest. In the afternoon, all parties were convened to a meeting and ordered Jiang and others to sign a guarantee that they would no longer gather crowds to cause trouble. Jiang said that the turbid drinking water was related to life, that all the townspeople should question the paper mill, but that they would not dare to take any irregular actions. As for the slogans found, it was unknown who wrote them, and it was difficult to write a guarantee of responsibility. County Magistrate Jiang then ordered the police to detain Jiang and others in the county public security bureau. On the 4th, the shops in the town continued to strike because the county government had not released Jiang and others, and the paper mill had no perfect solution for the discharge of sewage.</p>

<p>This year's spring silkworms have all been placed on the straw beds, and the cocoons are of very good quality. The Cocoon Industry Association held a meeting on the 30th of last month and decided that the price for high-quality fresh cocoons would be 25 yuan per dan, and the price for lower-quality cocoons would be 20 yuan per dan. Each cocoon merchant determined to open the scales on June 4th. It is now known that the cocoon merchants in the northern routes, such as Qianzhou and Yuqi, opened the scales on the afternoon of the 3rd. The cocoon price is between 30 yuan and 25 yuan. Generally, silkworm farmers, because the price of leaves eaten when raising silkworms is 2 yuan and 5 jiao per dan, and the current low price of cocoons means too much loss in terms of cost, so they are unwilling to sell at low prices and are drying the fresh cocoons into dry cocoons. Cocoon merchants in Zhangcun Youjia, Tan, and other places opened the scales yesterday, and the price of high-quality cocoons was 36-37 yuan, but the amount of goods arriving was very small. The cocoon merchants in the remaining east, west, and south routes also opened the scales one after another, and the cocoon price was also around 30 yuan.</p>

<p>Li Yangquan, a 21-year-old from Beiping, recently came to Shanghai from Beiping to visit friends and seek employment, but was unsuccessful. Because he was living in a foreign land and his travel expenses were exhausted, he found it difficult to make a living. So he came to Wuxi alone and went to the vagrant vocational training center, requesting to be admitted to learn a craft to temporarily maintain his livelihood. Unexpectedly, the center refused to accept him. In a fit of anger, Li had the idea of committing suicide. Yesterday, he took the Limin轮船 to Nanfangquan in the 14th district. When the ship passed the Wuli Lake area, he intended to drown himself in the lake. Fortunately, he was discovered by the boatman, who urged him to disembark at Liyuan. However, Li was determined to die and planned to hire a boat to the foot of Baojie Mountain on the opposite bank to commit suicide. This was learned by the guards of the local security regiment, who informed the head of the regiment, Shen Jinghua, and the head of the 4th district, Yu Xunzhen, and sent him to headquarters to find a way to help him.</p>

<p>The Wuxi-Changshu, Suzhou-Changshu, and Changshu-Taicang three highways, which were ordered to be built in this county, were originally limited to military transportation, and the roadbeds and bridges were not very perfect. Now that the Five Provinces Joint Conference is scheduled to open in mid-October, and the three roads have not yet been connected, the Construction Department has specially ordered the county government here to handle the current connection work. The district office supervised the workers to build the roads, and after half a month of work, the project has now been completed. However, there is a Zhou Tang Bridge on the connecting section, which is a large-scale project. It is currently being contracted by the Yuqing Construction Company and is expected to be completed by the end of this month. However, the wooden bridges built on the Suzhou-Changshu Road are all wooden-footed and wooden-surfaced, with a load capacity of only three tons, which is limited to military use. Now that long-distance buses are running, it is feared that they will not be able to bear the weight. Therefore, Pang Shoubai, the head of the Construction Section of this county, submitted a report to the department for instructions, and said that if the bridges were rebuilt, there would be 28 bridges, requiring a huge sum of 120,000 yuan. The Construction Department will now send personnel to conduct on-site surveys and then find a way to rebuild them.</p>

<p>Since the establishment of the sericulture improvement area in Yangzhou County, 70% of silkworm farmers have raised improved varieties of silkworms, and the estimated amount of silkworm eggs is nearly 30,000 sheets. The silkworms are developing smoothly and the results are good. It is estimated that there will be more than 5,000 piculs of fresh cocoons. Although the cocoon merchants want to open the scales to purchase cocoons, they have no buyers. They have traveled to Wuxi and Shanghai, but no cocoon merchants have come. In this situation, the mature cocoons will not be able to be sold, which will greatly hinder the future of improvement. In order to improve sericulture and show consideration for silkworm farmers, the authorities of the improvement area went to the province to find a way to help them and negotiated with the head office of the Jiangsu Farmers Bank to borrow more than 80,000 yuan, which was distributed to various cocoon merchants to purchase cocoons and sell them to merchants. It is reported that the merchants plan to start purchasing cocoons from the 6th of this month.</p>

<p>(Continued) Qian Jiaju</p>
<p>Speaking of Hunanese people, it reminds us of what Li Ji said about "Hunan donkeys" in my life. It's true that the perseverance, diligence, and frugality of Hunanese people are unmatched by those of any other province. The most peculiar thing is that the weavers of native cloth in Liuzhou and Guilin are almost entirely Hunanese. There are not many weavers of native cloth in Liuzhou, but there are thousands of households in Guilin. They are concentrated in several areas, which are in fact Hunanese colonies. Each family has at least three or two looms, and some have more than ten. These looms are entirely wooden handlooms. They step on the bottom with their feet and shuttle across the top with their hands. As long as they get up at five or six in the morning every day, we will hear the sound of their looms, "Che Tai Che Tai", and this sound will not stop until eleven or twelve o'clock at night. In terms of working hours, they work at least fifteen or sixteen hours a day. But how much money do they earn a day? According to the people from the textile workers' union, "Their wages are calculated by the piece. They are paid three strings and two coins for weaving ten zhang of cloth, and one string and six coins for weaving five zhang of cloth. When the price of copper coins was high in the past, three strings and two coins were equivalent to one yuan, and one string and six coins were equivalent to fifty cents. Workers can weave about one piece of cloth five zhang long from six o'clock in the morning to twelve o'clock at night. However, since the price of copper coins has fallen (the price in the Guilin area has fallen daily due to the influx of inferior copper coins from Hunan, and small merchants and handicraft workers have suffered greatly and complained about their fate), each cent of silver is worth forty-nine copper coins, and one string and six coins is only equivalent to more than thirty cents. The workers found it difficult to maintain their livelihood and proposed through the weaving workers' union to ask the employers to change the wage unit to silver dollars, but the employers insisted on refusing. The two sides argued for days, and the case was submitted to the county government, but it could not be resolved. It was then handed over to the workers' union and the chamber of commerce for mediation, but it ended up with no results. However, the employers took the opportunity to remove all five executive committee members of the weaving cloth union and resolved that no one should hire them. The workers had no way to make a living and eventually failed. Now no one dares to be an executive member, and the weaving cloth union has therefore been suspended. This problem has also been solved without being resolved." This passage not only shows how the old-fashioned small handicraft owners exploited the workers, even though the employers and employees were both Hunanese, their conflict of interest did not disappear due to provincial boundaries. *</p>
<p>On the other hand, it can also explain the miserable state of China's inherent handicraft industry, which relies on it *</p>
<p>for its existence after the invasion of capitalist commodities (foreign cloth and cotton fabrics) into the interior of China. Guilin relies on its underdeveloped transportation and the difficulty of transportation. The import of cheap foreign goods must be transported by human *</p>
<p>labor and heavy taxes, so the native cloth industry can only survive. However, even this "last breath" of fate is maintained by the cruel exploitation of *</p>
<p>labor.</p>
<p>The commerce of Guilin has also been very depressed in recent years. The main reason is of course the bankruptcy of the countryside, which makes farmers' purchasing power weak. As for rural finance, it is as depleted as in Liuzhou. For example, in terms of borrowing, the habit of borrowing money and repaying interest in grain is very common. Farmers borrow one string of money and add three catties of interest grain in addition to repaying the principal. This is the most common interest rate in Guilin. One string of money is only equivalent to two dimes, and three catties of grain *</p>
<p>are worth one dime and two cents. It is usually borrowed during sowing (February and March) and repaid during harvest (July and August), which is only five or six months, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of ten *</p>
<p>percent. Although the Guilin Guangxi Bank is currently piloting rural loans, four agents are designated in the four townships of the southeast, northwest. Farmers can request loans from the agents, and the agents can coordinate with the bank. The loan amount per household must not exceed 100 yuan, and the monthly interest rate is 1.5%, of which 0.5% is used to cover the agent's remuneration. *</p>
<p>The bank actually gets 1%. However, the agent is solely responsible for the farmers' creditworthiness and whether they can repay the loan. This intention of coordinating rural finance is sincerely *</p>
<p>worthy of our admiration, but the impact is another question. Because the procedures for borrowing money from the bank are too complicated, the *</p>
<p>farmers who can get the trust of the agent (the agents are mostly local landlords or gentry) are not common in the countryside. Although the bank has this good *</p>
<p>intention, how can the poor farmers benefit from it? I have asked the village chiefs of various villages about the Guangxi Bank's rural loans more than once, but *</p>
<p>most of them do not even know that this is happening. Regarding the Guangxi Bank's rural loans, Mr. Ji Muqiao, a teacher of agricultural economics at Liangfeng (forty miles from Guilin) Normal *</p>
<p>College, said a few words that are worth our consideration: "It is a joke to rely on bank loans to save *</p>
<p>the countryside, because the amount is too small, so farmers cannot receive real benefits. For example, the rural loans of Guilin Bank, we have never even heard *</p>
<p>of them, so it goes without saying that they have little impact. To have real relief, a large amount of funds is necessary, but may I ask where the *</p>
<p>funds of Guangxi Bank come from? Isn't the money raised by so-called land tax surcharges, deed tax surcharges,... First, the farmers take it out, and then *</p>
<p>use this money to lend it to them. Is it not ridiculous to provide relief in this way?"</p>
<p>Here, I would like to introduce the Guangxi Normal College. The school is located in Liangfeng Park, forty miles away from Guilin. Liangfeng is a *</p>
<p>village name, accessible by highway, about an hour away. It is said that the park was owned by Tang Zishi, a wealthy gentry at the end of the Qing Dynasty. This gentry established *</p>
<p>special merits during the suppression of the Taiping Rebellion and was unwilling to become an official. He preferred to be a local tyrant in Guilin. The park was built by him by exploiting the uncompensated *</p>
<p>labor of the people. By the Republic of China, his descendants were not very successful and sold it cheaply to Cen Chunxuan. After Cen Chunxuan fell out of favor, it was taken back as a *</p>
<p>park. Now it is used as the site of the normal college. It is indeed a secluded place with beautiful scenery and a quiet environment. Mr. Yang Dongchun, the president of the college, *</p>
<p>is also a scholar who is sincere in his work and rich in knowledge. According to the college authorities, the mission of the normal college is "to provide for rural normal schools, and rural *</p>
<p>normal schools are for rural education." Therefore, what they focus on is how to train rural teachers, and the courses they teach are mostly *</p>
<p>related to rural production. At the same time, they pay more attention to rural economic problems and have also conducted several small-scale surveys. *</p>
<p>The focus of the survey is on the relationship between land ownership. Most of the students at the normal college come from the fields. It is said that many of them have even been elementary school principals. *</p>
<p>Therefore, they have not only personally witnessed rural life, but also experienced it themselves. At this time, they can be taught correct thinking methods and *</p>
<p>instilled with scientific agricultural knowledge. Will it not be twice the result with half the effort, and will it also be a ray of dawn for improving the Guangxi countryside?</p>
<p>"To go to Guilin and not visit the famous mountains is like passing by a butcher's shop and not having a big meal," a friend said to us in this way. But the saying "Guilin's mountains and *</p>
<p>rivers are the best in the world" really refers to the area upstream of the Guijiang River above Yangshuo. The beauty of their mountain peaks lies entirely in their composition of rocks, with solitary *</p>
<p>peaks standing tall, without any soil mountains interspersed, and they are not connected to each other, so they are particularly exquisite and graceful. One day, we invited several friends *</p>
<p>to visit Qixingyan Cave. The cave is about two li long, and it is dark inside. It cannot be done without lights. A local person is responsible for guiding, leading with two torches. Inside the cave, *</p>
<p>there are ups and downs, and all the scenes are formed by the dripping and congealing of stalactites. The guide holds the torch and sings, "The torch shines brightly, illuminating *</p>
<p>the fairy's lamp hall... The torch shines brilliantly, illuminating the fairy's cloth canopy mountain..." Seeing a slope, he points to it as Motian Ridge. Seeing a stone, he points to it as *</p>
<p>the Cloth Bag Monk, such as the Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea, the Carp Leaping over the Dragon Gate, the Fisherman Casting his Net... Far-fetched associations are endless. It is estimated that some of them have very similar shapes and spirits. After walking for about half an hour, we suddenly saw a faint light. The guide shouted, "It's dawn, it's dawn!" Then we had already exited from another cave entrance. After the tour, we took a short rest at Qixia Temple. *</p>
<p>There are vendors in the dilapidated temple. Seeing that we were wearing Western clothes and behaved like wealthy people, they regarded us as "drivers" on the car. This is truly "the utmost *</p>
<p>honor." However, it can also be seen the status of car drivers in the minds of the general public in Guangxi.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Mayor Wu Inspected the New Life Movement Persuasion Corps Yesterday <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Five hundred and five teams participated in the sports field. Mayor Wu encouraged the team members to pay attention to sincerity. According to the Central News Agency, in order to enable the citizens of the city to realize the New Life Movement, the Shanghai Municipal New Life Movement Promotion Association has organized persuasion corps from the military, police, agriculture, industry, commerce, and education sectors. At 10:00 AM on the 4th, Mayor Wu personally inspected them at the Municipal No. 1 Public Sports Field and gave an earnest speech. The persuasion corps were in high spirits and orderly. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Situation of the Meeting Place <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The meeting place was the Municipal No. 1 Public Sports Field. The party and national flags were hung high outside the gate. On the north side of the meeting place in the center was the general inspection platform. To the left of the platform was the Boy Scout military band, and to the right of the platform was the police military band. In front of the platform, the persuasion corps were arranged in order. The first row was the Boy Scout persuasion corps, the second row was the police persuasion corps, the third row was the security team persuasion corps, the fourth row was the self-defense corps persuasion corps, the fifth row was the military police persuasion corps, the sixth row was the education sector persuasion corps, and the seventh row was the agriculture, industry, and commerce persuasion corps. The arrangement was very neat, and the whole atmosphere was very solemn.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Number of Participating Teams <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>There were 34 Boy Scout persuasion corps, 155 education sector persuasion corps, 150 agriculture, industry, and commerce persuasion corps, 120 police persuasion corps, 20 security team persuasion corps, 20 self-defense corps persuasion corps, and 6 military police persuasion corps, totaling 505 teams. More than 2,000 people, including Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Director of Education Pan Gongzhan, Director of Public Security Wen Hongen, Director of Health Li Ting'an, Director of Social Affairs Wu Xingya (represented by Wu Huanru), Boy Scout Director Leng Xueqiao, and American Boy Scout Executive Committee Member Wei Bai, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Director Pan's Report <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>After performing the ceremony, Director of Education Pan Gongzhan gave a brief report, saying, "Today is the day for the Shanghai Municipal New Life Movement Promotion Association's persuasion corps to hold a general inspection. The significance of the inspection lies in estimating the strength of the persuasion corps itself. The hope of the inspection is that from today onwards, each team can work hard to persuade the citizens of the city to earnestly implement the New Life Movement. The realization of the New Life Movement for the citizens of the city depends on the efforts of each persuasion corps, so the responsibility of the persuasion corps is quite heavy. Now, in order to facilitate the progress of the work, the association has divided into Boy Scouts, military police, security teams, self-defense corps, and agriculture, industry, commerce, and education persuasion corps. There are separate persuasion guidelines for all work, which can be consulted. What is stipulated in the New Life Movement Covenant cannot be realized all at once, so the association is now starting with cleanliness and order. If this is done effectively, we will proceed to the second step. When the persuasion corps set out, they should have a peaceful and loving attitude and a spirit of setting an example, persuading all sectors. The persuasion corps themselves have no executive power other than persuasion. If they deem it necessary, they can report to the competent authorities for disposal."</p>
<h3 id="e130">Mayor Wu's Inspection <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>After Director Pan's report, Mayor Wu, accompanied by Director Wen, Director Pan, Director Li, etc., stepped down from the inspection platform. All the persuasion corps stood at attention and saluted the inspecting officer. Mayor Wu and others inspected the persuasion corps separately in the uplifting sound of military music. At this time, the team members were in even higher spirits, and the whole scene was very solemn. After the inspection of each team, Mayor Wu and others returned to the general inspection platform. Then, Mayor Wu began to give a speech to each inspection team.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Mayor Wu's Speech <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Mayor Wu said in his speech, "Everyone, whether or not the Chinese National Revolution can succeed depends entirely on whether or not this New Life Movement can succeed. In the process of the National Revolution, the number of obstacles we have encountered, the number of enemies we have seen, and the magnitude of the blows we have suffered are all well known. If we want to break through this difficult situation and make the National Revolution proceed smoothly, then only the success of the New Life Movement advocated by Chairman Chiang can do it. If the New Life Movement succeeds, then the National Revolution can be thoroughly successful. If the National Revolution succeeds, then there will be bright hope for China's future. Since the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal New Life Movement Promotion Association, it has originally been carried out in two steps: first, propaganda, and second, implementation. And during the implementation, it must go through a period of persuasion, so there is the organization of the persuasion corps. Each sector organizes the persuasion corps separately, and within its own scope, it is responsible for practical persuasion. The responsibility of this persuasion corps is extremely important for whether or not the New Life Movement can be realized. Therefore, the persuasion corps bears extremely important responsibilities, both directly and indirectly, to the country and society. Anyone who is a member of the persuasion corps must first be sincere, because only with sincerity can they practice the New Life Movement in their own lives, and this New Life Movement can then show its truth. With truth, they can set an example and influence others, persuade others, and make the New Life Movement successful. Secondly, our attitude should be one of serving the society and the people, with courteous actions and peaceful and sincere language. Because the New Life Movement is related to the prosperity of the country and the nation, each persuasion corps should do it practically," etc. Director of Health Li Ting'an also gave a speech, but it was omitted for brevity. At 11:00 AM, the inspection ended, and each team marched out in an orderly manner.</p>
<h3 id="e132">New Life Covenant <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Summary of the New Life Covenant regarding hygiene: (1) In terms of food: 1. Do not smoke. Smoking damages the nerves, stimulates the respiratory system, stains the fingers, and is unsightly. Not smoking can save money. 2. Do not drink excessively. Alcohol harms the body, ruins morality, and wastes money. 3. Do not eat snacks to avoid harming the stomach and intestines and give the digestive system a certain amount of rest. 4. Drink several glasses of boiled water early in the morning. 5. Do not eat unclean food. Unclean food should be sacrificed rather than eaten to avoid illness. 6. Do not drink unboiled water to avoid many infectious diseases. This is a very good old habit of our nation. 7. Be sure to rinse your mouth after eating and brush your teeth every morning to keep your mouth clean and prevent food residue from decomposing and rotting in the mouth and keep your teeth strong. 8. Strive to keep the kitchen and tableware clean. The cleanliness of the kitchen is the most important. It is best to have screens and covers. After using tableware, boil it in boiling water. (2) In terms of clothing: 1. Clothes should be simple, neat, and clean. Clothes are best made of washable materials. Underwear should be changed frequently. 2. Be sure to carry a handkerchief with you for wiping. When there is no sputum container, spit the sputum on the handkerchief. When sneezing or coughing, cover your mouth and nose with a handkerchief. If you do this when sneezing or coughing, people will not find it offensive. (3) In terms of housing: 1. The house should be tidy. 2. Doors and windows should be opened frequently to allow dirty air to flow out and fresh air from outside to come in. 3. Go to bed and get up early. 4.

Spitting everywhere can easily infect others. Spit sputum into sputum containers. 17. Do not urinate or defecate anywhere. Urinating or defecating anywhere is not only unsightly but also dirties the ground, and germs are more likely to infect others. 18. Dump garbage in the trash can so that cleaners can easily remove it, keep the streets clean, and control flies. 19. Every household should sweep the street in front of their door every day. 20. Kill flies. 21. Kill rats. (4) In terms of movement: 1. Do not urinate anywhere.</p>

(B) Special: (1) Boy Scout Guidance Team should pay special attention to order in public places and schools, and to the rescue of women, children, the elderly, and the weak. (2) The Education Sector Guidance Team should focus especially on students in schools, and teachers and staff in each school, especially those responsible for the guidance department, should work together. (3) The Police Guidance Team should focus on ordinary citizens and correct anyone who is improperly dressed, behaves badly, spits or urinates indiscriminately, or underage children smoking cigarettes, etc. They should also publicize the necessity of vaccination to avoid smallpox and the necessity of injections for disease prevention. They should also pay special attention to the cleanliness of snack stalls in streets and alleys, as well as hotels, taverns, and restaurants. (4) The Agricultural, Industrial, and Commercial Guidance Team should focus on rural villages, factories, and shops, and provide guidance on sanitation facilities, fire prevention equipment, food and lodging places, and lifestyles at any time and place. (5) The Security Team Guidance Team should assist the police and guide citizens in certain situations. (6) The Defense Corps is organized by the business community, so its guidance team can also focus on shops, paying attention to the merchants' gentle attitude, fair transactions, neat attire, and honest language. (7) The Military Police Guidance Team should focus on soldiers and correct any irregular lifestyles, improper behavior, arrogant attitudes towards ordinary citizens, or failure to pay for tickets or transportation in public places. (C) Mixed: The mixed organization focuses on complex public places because such places contain people of various occupations. It is feared that no single team can fulfill the responsibility of guidance, so each team can form a mixed organization. For example, at the station, if a soldier acts unreasonably, the military police can guide him. If a woman or child acts unreasonably, the Boy Scouts can guide them, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Inventory of Antiquities from the Palace Museum Stored in Shanghai Begins Yesterday; Party and Government Agencies Dispatch Personnel for Supervision; Expected to Take More Than a Year to Complete <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>A report from the Kuomintang News Agency states that due to the former director of the Palace Museum, Yi Peiji, being accused of corruption and fleeing without a trace, the Central Government and the Executive Yuan, considering that the antiquities are of great importance to Chinese culture, have not only appointed Ma Heng as the new director of the museum but also ordered the Shanghai Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Government to send personnel to the site to jointly supervise. The Municipal Party Department has designated six executive committee members, including Cai Hongtian, Wu Xiu, Du Mengsen, Lin Kecong, Tang Tie, and Shen Moseng, and the Municipal Government has also dispatched Li Dachao, the chief of the First Section, and Zhou Songhe to handle the matter. Furthermore, in order to expedite the process, the Municipal Government has proposed that three groups conduct the inventory simultaneously to complete it as soon as possible. However, the Municipal Government is finding it difficult to dispatch so many staff, so it has sent a letter to the Municipal Education Bureau requesting the assistance of Ding Shoutang, Wang Xuequan, and Shen Xuexin. It is reported that the work began at 9:00 a.m. yesterday, with the arrival of Cai Hongtian, Wu Xiu, Du Mengsen, Lin Kecong, Tang Tie, Li Dachao, Zhou Songhe, Ding Shoutang, and Shen Xuexin. It is reported that only one group was checking yesterday and that three groups will not be able to proceed simultaneously until the court has completed its random inspection. It is estimated that it will take the court four to five months to complete its inspection, and it will be four to five months before the party and government agencies can work together in three groups. Based on the current estimate of over 13,000 boxes of antiquities, it will take at least more than a year to complete the inventory.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Completion of the Takeover of the Great Northern and Great Eastern Submarine Cables Yesterday; Remarks by Shen Fuhai <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>According to the Kuomintang News Agency, the Ministry of Communications has completed all the procedures for taking over the Great Northern and Great Eastern submarine cables. A reporter from the Kuomintang News Agency visited Shen Fuhai, an engineer at the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau on Fuzhou Road, for an interview, as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e136">Several Years of Disputes Resolved in One Day <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Shen first stated that the Great Northern and Great Eastern submarine cables were leased from China at the end of the Qing Dynasty, with a 30-year lease that expired in 1930. Subsequently, because the payment had not been fully settled, the Great Northern and Great Eastern refused to hand over the cables. After repeated negotiations, the Ministry of Communications was authorized to take them back on May 20 of this year. Because the Ministry of Communications found the inspection of machines and cables to be complicated, it temporarily took over the reporting service first. At the same time, it increased the speed of electricity to send more reports and prepared to immediately put the machines into operation after the takeover. Yesterday, Mr. Shen, along with Mr. Boesen, the manager of the Great Northern and Great Eastern Company, handled all the handover matters. From today onwards, Shanghai can directly communicate with Yantai and Tianjin. The disputes that have been valued by the Chinese people for several years have been completely resolved in one day.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Construction of Reporting Rooms Still Awaits Its Day <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>He continued, regarding the disposition policy after the takeover, that because the matter is significant, careful consideration is needed. At present, although there are no problems with communication, the construction of telegraph rooms is an urgent matter. However, this submarine cable station must be near the coast, which is not only convenient for laying submarine cables but should also be in a place with convenient sea transportation. Therefore, the old submarine cable station near the company's Huabang Wharf is the most suitable location. However, selecting a location and constructing a building will probably not be completed in a short period of time.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Large Decrease in Food Imports from Various Countries; Announced by the International Trade Bureau <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>

<h3 id="e142">The Strike at the British American Tobacco Factory Escalates Yesterday; Company Hires New Workers to Cross the River; Union Attempts to Stop Them, Leading to Disturbances; Three Factories Respond but Soon Resume Work <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>According to the Ta Kung Pao, the strike at the British American Tobacco factory in Pudong has continued to this day and has not been resolved. At around 6:00 a.m. yesterday, the company hired more than 400 new workers to cross the river and enter the factory to work. Upon hearing this, the strike committee sent its entire maintenance team and propaganda team, as well as the original workers, to stop them, resulting in a conflict in which many workers were injured. Workers at the No. 3 factory in Yangshupu, Eastern Shanghai, also went on strike for three hours yesterday, but soon resumed work. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e143">Hiring New Workers <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Since all the workers at the British American Tobacco No. 2 factory went on strike on the 24th of last month, all work has completely stopped. Although the company has hired more than 30 White Russians to maintain operations in the tobacco leaf room, no Chinese workers have entered the factory to work, resulting in significant losses. At 6:20 a.m. yesterday, the company hired more than 400 workers in the Yangshupu area of ​​Puxi. The company sent a tugboat to tow a barge to cross the river to work. The strike committee learned of this and sent its personnel to stop them, resulting in a conflict between the two sides.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Disturbances Occur <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The company's small boat, for the first time at 6:20 a.m., towed three barges carrying a total of more than 200 White Russians and workers, intending to enter the factory to work. The strike committee learned of this and sent its entire maintenance team and propaganda team, totaling more than 600 people, to monitor and prevent the workers from landing on the wharf and around the new factory. As a result, the new workers did not land and the original boat returned. The second time, at 6:30 a.m., two more British American steamboats carrying hundreds of workers crossed the river to work. At this time, the factory had already sent more than 50 Western staff and White Russian workers to take care of and protect the new workers entering the factory. The striking workers, upon hearing this, were filled with indignation and rushed to stop them. However, the Western staff, all holding wooden sticks, beat many workers when they rushed up, who were sent to the Pudong Hospital for treatment by the union. Several staff members were also injured.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Police Ordered to Maintain Order <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Wuqin, the chief of the Third District Public Security Bureau, received a report that disturbances had occurred at the British American factory and ordered all the petition police stationed at the factory to take careful precautions. He also sought instructions from Mr. Wen Hongen of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, who dispatched an inspector and 50 long-term police officers to cross the river to assist in maintaining order. After the newly recruited workers were sent back by the original boat, the dispute subsided. By noon, the dispatched long-term police officers had begun to withdraw, and the strike committee continued to send more than 100 members of the maintenance team to patrol around the factory to prevent new workers from coming to work again.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Investigation of Injuries <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>When the disturbances occurred, many old workers at the Pudong factory were injured by wooden sticks.

They are still being treated in the hospital, while the others have been discharged after being bandaged by doctors.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Impact on the No. 3 Factory <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The British American Tobacco No. 3 factory on Taopeng Road in Yangshupu, Eastern Shanghai, employs more than 5,000 male and female workers. Since the strike occurred at the Pudong factory, the company's attitude has been firm, resulting in a lack of resolution and widespread anger. They convened a representative meeting the night before and decided to unanimously respond with a slowdown after entering the factory yesterday morning to urge the factory to realize the situation. After receiving the notice, all workers entered the factory at 6:00 a.m. yesterday and implemented the slowdown. The factory learned of this and, fearing that the strike would further escalate and affect business, notified the Yangshupu police station by telephone and ordered a large number of detectives to protect the factory. At the same time, they forced the workers in each room to work as usual. By around 10:00 a.m., the workers resumed work as usual.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Party and Government Thorough Investigation <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau, upon receiving a report of the disturbances at the British American Tobacco factory, feared that the situation would become more serious and difficult to resolve. Yesterday, they specially sent Lu Yinchu and Tan Peiyan to Pudong and Puxi to investigate the truth and submit it to the relevant authorities for handling. The union has also submitted a report to the party and government, requesting that they uphold justice, and will send personnel to petition this morning.</p>

<p>All Drivers to Resume Work This Morning According to the Ta Kung Pao, all the drivers of the Cheung Shing Motor Company suddenly went on strike together the day before yesterday to demand improved treatment. Yesterday, both labor and management sent representatives to petition the party and government agencies. After the authorities convened both parties for mediation, they signed five preliminary measures for settlement and announced a resolution. The workers are scheduled to resume work as usual starting at 6:00 a.m. this morning. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e151">Labor and Management Petition <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Because all the drivers of the Cheung Shing Company suddenly went on strike together the day before yesterday, all operations were suspended, resulting in significant losses. Therefore, at 10:00 a.m. yesterday, the company's assistant manager, Zhou Xizhen, brought a petition to the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting that the workers be ordered to resume work immediately. Otherwise, the company would be forced to recruit new workers. The labor side also petitioned the party and government agencies yesterday morning, accompanied by members of the drivers' union, because the labor-management negotiations the night before had yielded no results. Dai Youheng of the Municipal Party Department's Civil Movement Section and Zhao Lian of the Social Affairs Bureau's Third Section received them separately and promised to convene both parties for mediation immediately to prevent the strike from escalating.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Implementation of Mediation <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>After the party and government agencies received the requests from both labor and management of the Cheung Shing Company, fearing that the strike would be prolonged and would affect local transportation, they convened both parties at the Municipal Party Department on Fenglin Bridge for mediation. Zhu Weichang, Zhao Pingchen, and worker representatives Tan Along, Yang Quansheng, and Fei Xianghui from the drivers' union attended, as well as Zhou Xizhen from the management side and Zhao Lian from the Social Affairs Bureau. Dai Youheng, a staff member of the Civil Movement Section of the Municipal Party Department, presided over the meeting. After both parties detailed their opinions, they drafted five preliminary measures for resuming work, which were signed and resolved to the satisfaction of both parties.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Five Measures <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The five measures for resolution are as follows: (1) Driver Zhu Xigen will resume work first. (2) The compensation for the injury to Yang Xi will be borne equally by the company and Zhu Xigen. Considering Zhu Xigen's difficult financial situation, the wages during the strike should be paid by the management. (3) Other conditions will be handled after the resumption of work.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Resumption of Work This Morning <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>After the representatives of both parties signed the preliminary measures for settlement, the labor representatives immediately returned to the union to report to the public. However, some workers learned that the company had hired more than 20 new workers after the workers went on strike and demanded that they be suspended first before they would resume work. Subsequently, the union sent personnel to investigate the Cheung Shing Company on Beijing Road. After finding that the matter was not true, they reported back to the union, and the doubts were dispelled. It was decided that all workers would resume work at 6:00 a.m. this morning.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Six Provinces' Match Industry to Simultaneously Raise Prices on a Fixed Date; Approximately One to Five or Six Yuan Increase Per Box; Already Filed with the Ministry of Finance and Requested the Formation of a Control Association <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese National Match Industry Federation believes that the low-priced dumping of foreign goods has greatly affected the domestic match industry, causing the business of manufacturers in Hebei, Shandong, and other provinces to decline sharply and almost shut down. Therefore, it has formed a Price Maintenance Association of Six Provinces (Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi) to save the industry from decline. It has already decided on a price increase plan, which will be implemented starting on the 25th of this month. A reporter from the New News Agency inquired with Mr. Dong, the person in charge of the association today, and the conversation was as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e156">Reasons for the Price Increase <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>First, he said that the matches used in our country were mostly purchased from Sweden and Japan. Although the price is small, it is a daily necessity, so a huge amount of money leaks out every year. Therefore, it was decided to manufacture them domestically. In recent years, the domestic match industry has become increasingly developed, and the function of the products is no weaker than that of imported goods. The products of factories across the country can almost meet the demand. However, foreign goods, due to cheap raw materials and the preferential treatment of tax exemption for exports, can still be dumped in our country at low prices. The general public is only willing to buy cheap goods, regardless of whether they are domestic or foreign, competing to buy cheap goods, which has caused the business of the industry to decline. After the Ministry of Finance issued a new tariff on imported foreign goods, the situation was slightly reversed. However, some manufacturers in the interior have been unable to support themselves and have closed down. The association, in view of the tragic situation of member manufacturers, has specially formed the Price Maintenance Association of Six Provinces and will uniformly raise prices starting on the 25th of this month to maintain capital. The degree of price increase will range from one to five or six yuan per box. This has now been submitted to the Ministry of Finance for filing.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Tax Evasion and Dumping <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Later, when asked about the recent dumping of imported matches, he replied that since the revision of the import tax on foreign goods, it has been difficult for imported matches to be dumped in China according to normal business practices. After all, after the goods have been taxed once, the cost is naturally more expensive than domestic products, and there is no possibility of devaluing and dumping. However, imported matches are still common on the market, mostly due to tax evasion and smuggling into China. The association is also paying close attention to this. He also learned that the association plans to submit a request to the Ministry of Finance to quickly organize a match industry control association to formulate an overall relief plan.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, the matter of establishing an aviation route between Europe and Asia by the Eurasia Aviation Corporation has been delayed due to the frequent warfare in Xinjiang. Li Jingcong, the general manager of the company, is of the opinion that the war in Xinjiang has now come to an end. In order to quickly establish the aviation route, he telegraphed Sheng Shicai of the Xinjiang authority a few days ago, requesting that the route reach Dihua and Tacheng as soon as possible, in order to connect the Eurasia aviation route. Li also plans to take the company's plane to Dihua and meet with Sheng in person to discuss solutions to all difficulties. On the morning of the 4th, Li told a reporter that he had not received a reply to the telegram after many days. He will go to Beijing after receiving Sheng's reply and meet with Minister Zhu for instructions before taking a flight to Xinjiang to meet Sheng in person and discuss the matter.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Japanese Merchants Plan to Restore Navigation Route on the Sichuan River <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Japanese ships on the Sichuan River have been suspended for a long time. After the last strike on the Sichuan River ships, the Nissin Company restored the Shanghai-Yichang transshipment route to transport Japanese goods to Sichuan. However, they had to transship in Yichang. Recently, Japanese goods have been selling well in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, so the Nissin Company decided to restore the Sichuan River ship route. The company's president in Shanghai, Yoneri Tatsukichi, went to Tokyo to discuss the matter with the head office, and the head office agreed to allow the Shanghai-Yichang-Chongqing route to be restored. Yoneri has returned to Shanghai and will immediately overhaul the Iyomaru, which has been idle for a long time, and convene all the crew members. They plan to officially resume navigation around the 10th of this month. Once the business improves, they will add the Unyomaru to the route.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Resumption of Yangtze River Route Temporarily Postponed <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The company initially planned to resume all the Yangtze River routes at the same time, including the Yueyangmaru, Nanyomaru, Xiangyongmaru, Zuiyongmaru, and Daitei Maru, which had been suspended. Therefore, the company's president, Fukao, also came to Shanghai from Tokyo to inspect. However, due to the small amount of goods shipped from Shanghai, which relied entirely on the transport of Japanese goods, it was difficult to sustain. Therefore, it was decided to maintain four ships on the Yangtze River route, first resuming the Yichang-Shashi-Chuanxiang routes in the upper reaches, and then waiting for the opportunity to resume all the Yangtze River ships. A branch office in Chongqing has already been established.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Increase in Near-Sea Japanese Ships <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>The Nissin Company's near-sea division originally had nine ships on the Yangtze River. After January 28, it was reduced to one ship to maintain navigation rights. Now, because Japanese goods can be sold well on the Yangtze River and our country's miscellaneous grains are shipped to Japan in large quantities, the company is taking the opportunity to restore navigation on the Yangtze River. It has increased the number of ships to six, including the Liaohaimaru, Tianshanmaru, Daichimaru, Ten'ymaru, Wakamatsumaru, and Kinryumaru. The route runs from Wakamatsu, Sakito, Karatsu, Shanghai, Wuhu, Daye, to Hankou, with four to five trips per month.</p>

<p>The route from Shanghai to Chongming Beisha is served by five ferry companies, including Ping'an and Daxing Jufeng. Competition has been fierce, with price cuts as the main tactic. Although the shipping industry has mediated and requested government intervention, it has been ineffective. Recently, the Shanghai Shipping Guild invited shipowners from various companies to mediate, stating that price cuts ignore costs and are not a regular business practice. In this time of shipping industry downturn, the spirit of cooperation should be upheld, competitive sailing should be stopped, original prices should be restored, and scheduled sailings should be adopted in an open business model. This would benefit everyone. All five companies accepted the mediation, and the price war has ended. The fares of 60 cents, 40 cents, and 20 cents that were previously sold are now abolished, and the original cabin prices will be charged.</p>

<h3 id="e175">Ministry of Railways Orders Both Routes to Use Auditory Telegraphy; Implemented Within One Year <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways issued an order to the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations, which roughly stated: "It has been found that railways in various countries are increasingly using listening devices for telegraphy, which allows for convenient reception and transmission. When China's radio stations and the Beijing-Shanghai Railway and the Northeast Railways started, they also used the auditory system, and there were no obstacles in handling it. However, the state-owned railways still use the old-fashioned telegraph machines, which require copying the telegraph code on paper strips. Not only is the structure of the telegraph machines complex and more expensive, but the reception is also not quick, and the paper strips and ink are also wasteful. Most of the supplies are purchased from foreign merchants. In normal times, there is no way to stop the waste, and in times of emergency, there are many constraints, which have a great impact on railway traffic. It is necessary to strive for improvement to facilitate convenience. It is now found that the telegraph personnel of various routes lack practice in auditory reception, and it may be difficult to switch suddenly. However, practice makes perfect, and after several months of practice, they will be able to record as they listen. The accuracy and speed are no different from copying paper strips. Even if there are doubts about certain words or sentences, it is not difficult to ask the other party to repeat them. It is hereby ordered that the use of telegraph paper strips be abolished by July 1st of next year, and that auditory reception be used uniformly. The various routes should make practical preparations within this one-year period and formulate steps to earnestly train the telegraph personnel under their jurisdiction so that they can implement the order as scheduled. They should comply and report the preparations at any time. It is hoped that the various routes can implement the order ahead of schedule."</p>

Now that the Panchen Lama has arrived in Shanghai, we will take this good opportunity to respectfully invite him to promote domestic products and express our welcome. Correspondingly, we hereby request all participating manufacturers to prepare banners and lanterns to show their welcome and respect. Please check and handle accordingly."</p>

<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau dispatched a team of public officials and Tang Jinghuan, the district chief of the Second District, led a class of police officers to protect the order.

Although the venue was crowded, the goods of each factory and the items brought by the guests were safe. As for the entertainment venues, the audience was seated neatly, and the entertainment programs included Peking opera, drama, and Suzhou opera. Today's civilized drama is Two Lovers, and the night drama is Flowers and a Full Moon.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Special Price and Through Freight Rates for Goods on Both Routes; Responsible Transportation Specially Approved for Those Below Sixth Class <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Article 40, Paragraph 2 of the General Rules for Responsible Transportation of Freight Cars stipulates: "If the freight is transported at a special price and its freight rate is the same as or lower than that of the sixth class, the railway will not handle responsible transportation." However, because the basic freight rate of the special price goods on both routes is relatively low, its freight rate after the reduction is often the same as or lower than the sixth class, and the freight of goods calculated at the ordinary freight rate during through transportation is also sometimes equal to or lower than the sixth class freight rate due to the application of the "progressively increasing rate with distance" method for through freight rates. If responsible transportation is not handled according to the regulations, it will be inconvenient for merchants because they have no guarantee, and it will also be impossible to charge separately on the same freight bill because the freight rate on other routes is higher when doing through transportation. There are many obstacles. In order to seek the safety of merchants and develop through transportation, the Car Department has decided, in accordance with the principle of Article 40, Paragraph 1 of the Responsible Transportation Regulations, "If the freight is calculated at the sixth-class freight rate, the railway will not handle responsible transportation, but this restriction does not apply if the railway specially approves it," to not apply the provisions of Article 40, Paragraph 2 of the regulations to the special price goods on the road. If the freight is calculated at a special price or ordinary freight rate, the road will also specially approve responsible transportation if it results in being equal to or lower than the sixth-class freight rate due to the application of the progressively decreasing method. The one-tenth responsible transportation fee will be collected according to the actual number after the price reduction. The bureau has instructed approval and reported it to the Ministry of Railways for record.</p>

<p>The houses in Xicheng Lane on Malan Road, Saporey Road, and Ximen Road in the French Concession were sued by the landlord, Yiyuan Company, for compelling the tenants to sign a contract. The tenants then hired lawyer Wu Zhenming to file a lawsuit with the Shanghai Second Special District Local Court for arrears in rent. The court held a hearing on the 29th of last month. More than thirty tenants were accused and hired lawyer Wu Kaisheng as their litigation agent to appear in court and defend them. Dozens of representatives from various citizen groups and rent reduction associations in Shanghai attended the trial. After the debate, Judge Tu Shenjie of the Sixth Civil Court ordered the defense to conclude and scheduled the judgment for 2:00 PM on June 4th. Yesterday afternoon was the scheduled date for the judgment. More than thirty tenants and four representatives from the landlord's side arrived on time. Judge Tu then announced the judgment in the Seventh Court, stating that the contract signed by the plaintiff should be canceled and the defendant's rent should be a lease contract. All measures should be handled according to the principles of the previous Yikou Bank agency. The rest of the plaintiff's claims were rejected, and the litigation costs were shared equally. The tenants were satisfied and dispersed after hearing the verdict.

<p>A Datong News Agency reporter believed that the research association initiated by comedians was very interesting. Yesterday morning, he went to North Xizang Road to interview the famous comedian Liu Chunshan. However, Mr. Liu was still in bed, so his partner Jiang Tiankui (also a preparatory committee member) said to the reporter, "The Shanghai foreign concession is ten miles long, and the trend is to compete in extravagance and licentiousness. Moral concepts have been completely destroyed. The world and people's hearts are worthy of deep concern. Although there are many gentlemen in society who embrace the right wind and shift customs to restore the depraved style, their methods of persuasion are not as good as those of these old gentlemen. When the tongues of those who persuade are stretched out, those who listen have already covered their ears and run away quickly. Although we artists have a low profession, we dare not lag behind others in our concern for the world. We do not measure ourselves, and we try to hide criticism in humor and scolding. We dare not say that we have contributed to society, but we hope that, as the ancients said, our words are subtle and to the point, and can also resolve disputes."</p>

<h3 id="e191">Ferryboat Negligence Causes Tragedy: Boatman Heartlessly Looks On <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Empty boats vie for passengers; Wei Jinsheng falls into the river after collision; multiple attempts to save are ignored; boatmen are brutally inhumane | Municipal authorities should not turn a blind eye | The human-powered ferries on the Huangpu River are not only dilapidated and small, but the boatmen are also greedy for passengers, violating regulations. They compete for passengers, disregarding human life in the vast, wave-tossed river. What is recorded here is the cruelty of the boatmen, a truly shocking and heartbreaking event. The details are recorded below: villager Wei Jinsheng, nicknamed A Lin, 32 years old, lived at 189 Wei Lane, east of Tangqiao in Pudong. His father, A Dong, was nearly 60 years old, as was his mother. Shi Miaogen, 36, his wife, Mo, 29, had two daughters and one son: eldest daughter A Da, 8, second daughter Genda, 6, and son Qiutao, 2. Jinsheng, due to his own</p>

<p>focused on farming. The vegetables grown in the fields throughout the four seasons were carried to Shanghai to be sold, supporting the family. Every day he rose at 4 or 5 AM, carrying vegetables across the river to sell in Shanghai, and worked in the fields during the day – a diligent farmer who never stopped working. On May 30th of this year, Jinsheng, lacking vegetables, rose early around 3 AM, carrying a pair of empty baskets (containing three cabbages unsold from the previous day), intending to sell them in Shanghai. He boarded Ji Jieda's ferry at Dongjiadu Wharf. On the boat were boatman Zhang Rongsheng and others, also ferrying passengers. The boat was already</p>
<h3 id="e193">Over Capacity <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>The boat had barely set off and not even reached the halfway point when Zhao Quanfa, accompanied by Zhao Jintao, and Zhu Guisheng, accompanied by Guan Rong, each piloting empty ferries from the west side of Pudong, raced towards the Pudong wharf like boats in a competition, vying for passengers, heedless of other boats and danger, ramming their boats forward. The two empty boats crashed like arrows into the heavily loaded boat of Ji Jieda. The force was tremendous, the tide swift. This pitiful farmer, Wei Jinsheng, was sacrificed at the altar of the ferrymen’s greed for profit, and drowned in the river. Anyone who falls into the water will resurface at least three times before sinking. But Wei Jinsheng only surfaced once and</p>
<h3 id="e194">Cried for Help <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>The boatmen ignored him. He surfaced a second time crying for help. Some passengers on the boat, intimidating the others, forbade them from speaking out, and each sailed on their way, while the helpless, voiceless man surfaced a third time and then tragically drowned, his corpse sinking to join the river spirits. Some passengers witnessed this tragic scene, but since they were in the middle of the river, their lives depended on the boatmen, so they only sighed in unison. Someone said, "This deceased is from Wei Lane." The boatman, hearing this, immediately shouted, "What's it to you?" Fearing the news would leak, they confiscated the two empty baskets and deceptively reported to the water patrol that a thirteen or fourteen year old girl from Jiangbei had</p>
<h3 id="e195">Been Careless <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>and fallen into the water, hoping to turn the death of a person into nothing, congratulating themselves on their plan. However, Wei Jinsheng had tragically died at the bottom of the river, and his family did not know. After four days, he had not returned home. His family grew anxious, as Jinsheng was an honest man who never stayed out overnight; something must have happened. His father, Wei A Dong, went to the Tangqiao area to inquire. Everyone in the town's teahouses and taverns was discussing the ferryboat tragedy of May 30th. Miaogen joined the listeners, and idlers were saying that there were still two baskets and three cabbages. Wei Miaogen, hearing this, felt as though struck by lightning – these were his brother's belongings! Combined with his four-day absence, he was convinced that his brother had</p>
<h3 id="e196">Met with Misfortune <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>He returned home and told the family, who wailed and cried inconsolably. Since the body had not been found and the boatmen had not been apprehended, nothing was clear. He hired someone to investigate the situation at the time and the names of the boatmen on the two boats, and requested the life-saving bureau to pay attention. It wasn't until the 3rd of this month that the life-saving bureau retrieved a male corpse at Lujiazui in Pudong. Wei Miaogen was called to the scene to identify it. It was indeed his brother. The corpse was swollen, with blood flowing from the mouth and nose, showing the pain of struggling for life. Miaogen, having identified his brother's body, cried and returned home. Besides the family rushing to</p>

<p>Wei's father, A Dong, reported to the water patrol, who arrested Ji Jieda. The Third District Third Precinct also arrested Zhang Rongsheng and sent him to the water patrol, to be handed over to the Public Security Bureau. Zhao Quanfa, Zhao Jintao, Zhu Guisheng, Guan Rong and others were negligent in their duties and careless of human life, so they should not be allowed to roam free. He has already ordered their arrest and investigation. Wei Miaogen then reported to the local court, requesting an autopsy. Prosecutor Zhang Zi and autopsy inspector Xuan Zhiming were dispatched to the life-saving bureau to examine the body, confirming the cause of death as drowning. After filling out the autopsy report, Wei Miaogen stated that his brother had died tragically and requested justice for the boatmen's cruel actions. The judge instructed him to sign a guarantee for the funeral arrangements and granted the Public Security Bureau permission to bring the matter to court for legal action.</p>

<p>Chen Jinrong, 46, a farmer from Chenjiazhai, Chenjiawan, Minhang District, Shanghai County, with his wife, Chen Wu, and six children, was unable to make a living by simply farming in the midst of the rural economic collapse. So, during the summer off-season, he sold vegetables. The other day, on Sunday, Chen carried a load of cabbage to Beiqiao to sell. He was walking along the side of the road toward Zhuanqiao when, unexpectedly, Liu Huizhi, a comprador from the Shanghai Industrial Bank, was being driven in his private car by his chauffeur, Chen A Rong, speeding along the road. Another car, driven by a Westerner, deliberately raced with Liu's car, causing the cars to</p>
<p>lose control. The car veered and hit the farmer (Chen Jinrong), knocking him and his load into the ditch, fatally injuring him. The county Public Security Bureau was notified and sent police to the scene. Due to the involvement of the Westerner, Liu's driver, Chen A Rong, was detained, and the family of the deceased was notified. The victim's wife arrived at the scene, wailing inconsolably, only adding to the suffering of the widow and orphans who demanded justice. Yesterday, the case was transferred to the local court for investigation.</p>

<p>The frog, commonly known as the field chicken, guards the fields and kills insects that harm crops. The Zhuanqiao Agricultural Education Center, recognizing its contribution to farmers, had previously requested the government to strictly prohibit its capture. Now, during the frog breeding season, ignorant and foolish people inevitably revert to their old habits, capturing and eating them. Therefore, starting yesterday, (a frog protection movement was launched) with staff sent to various villages and fields to publicize the benefits of frogs to farmers, the inhumanity of capturing them, and its conflict with national laws, etc. Village improvement associations will be convened to discuss frog protection methods, aiming to increase the number of beneficial insects and increase agricultural yields.</p>

<p>Liu Shufan, former director of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, and Si Da, manager of the Shanghai branch of the Savings and Remittance Bureau, colluded during their tenure, cleverly establishing the pseudonym "Xun Ji" to transfer savings within the bureau, using them as personal loans for trading in government bonds. The amount exceeded 400,000, mostly without calculating interest, solely for their own benefit, disregarding the damage to the national treasury. Furthermore, Yang Jianping, who participated in the Fujian rebellion, while serving as director of the Savings and Remittance Bureau, also colluded with his relatives from Guangdong, Zhao Baoshan, and real estate broker Yang Peichang. They took advantage of the bureau's purchase of land on Albert Road and Yuyuan Road, inflating the land prices and illegally profiting by 164,000 taels of silver, which they divided among themselves. After the discovery, in addition to the Control Yuan impeaching Liu, Yang, and others with official positions, the First Special District Local Court Prosecutor's Office investigated and confirmed the facts, prosecuting them for dereliction of duty and fraud. Among them, Yang Jianping fled to avoid prosecution for treason. The remaining four defendants, Liu, Ren, Zhao, and Yang, have all been summoned and interrogated, and ordered to post bail pending judgment. Yesterday afternoon was the date for the verdict in the case. Only Liu Shufan and Ren Sida surrendered themselves. Zhao Baoshan and Yang Peichang, knowing they could not escape punishment, failed to appear. Judge Liu Yukui, together with Prosecutor Zhong, opened the court and announced the verdict: Liu Shufan was sentenced to one year and two months imprisonment, Ren Sida to one year imprisonment, Zhao Baoshan to two years and six months imprisonment, and Yang Peichang to one year and six months imprisonment. All were deprived of their civil rights for five years. Liu and Ren were also informed that they could post their original bail during the appeal period.</p>

<p>According to Datong News Agency, the Peideli water cut-off dispute on Xinzha Road was resolved after the landlord agreed to deduct two yuan from the rent each month, and the tenants would handle the water installation themselves with the water company. The water company has been sending staff to turn on the water since the 1st of this month, for the past four days. Yesterday morning, the newspaper reported that the water company had continued to cut off the water in Peideli. A reporter from Datong News Agency went to the area yesterday morning to investigate the truth and found that it was not the case. The reason for the false rumor was that the public water pipe installed at the entrance of the second alley of Peideli was being repaired by the company, and the water was cut off for one hour, leading to a misunderstanding. Currently, the tenants are negotiating the contract procedures with the water company, and the contracts are expected to be signed today or tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e202">A Love Suicide of a Rural Woman: Trapped by Economic Hardship, She Ends It All With Death; Attempted Suicide by Poisoning, Slightly Recovered <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>On the evening of the 2nd of this month, Shen Chongfa and his concubine Shi Gengshi both took poison, and were sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. The details have been briefly recorded in this newspaper. Here is a supplementary account of their suicide details. Shi Shunjin, 58, a native of Xiangshan, Zhejiang, is the cook on the Junhe patrol boat (stationed in Wusong) belonging to the Jiangsu Maritime Provincial Public Security Team. His family lives in his hometown. His daughter, Shi Gengshi, 20, married Chen Genfa in her hometown three years ago. Due to continuous famine in her hometown and poverty, Gengshi came to Shanghai to work as a domestic helper. Soon, she fell in love with Shen Chongfa (29, originally a shop assistant), a fellow villager working at a gambling table in Shenji Li. Shen was already married to Wang, 27, and the couple lived together in the front room of the second floor at 11 Dingxiang Lane, O'Leary Road, south of the French Concession's Slaughterhouse Company. Shi, deeply in love with Shen, knew that Shen had a wife and was willing to be his concubine. She divorced her husband, but lacked the funds. Shen was also penniless and unable to find a solution. Gengshi asked her mother to borrow 100 yuan, and managed to raise several tens of yuan herself, to complete the divorce procedures. Afterwards, she rented a small room on the second floor of 68 Min Village, 311 Min Ti Ni Yin Road, French Concession, and lived with Shen. Their relationship deepened. Unfortunately, good times did not last. Due to the authorities' ban on gambling, Shen lost his job. For the past three years, Shen's finances have been extremely tight. He had been unable to repay any of the debt Gengshi's mother had borrowed for the divorce. Now, Gengshi's mother had repeatedly sent letters from her hometown, urgently demanding the repayment of the loan. Shen and Gengshi were at their wits' end, and feeling unable to repay the debt, they decided to commit suicide together. On the afternoon of the 2nd, at 6:00 PM, Gengshi went out and bought a box of opium (costing 1 yuan) and returned home. She swallowed two-thirds of it and waited in bed for death to arrive. When Shen returned home and learned that Gengshi had taken poison, he swallowed the remaining raw opium and lay in bed with Gengshi, waiting for death. At 11:00 PM that night, when the couple were experiencing the effects of the poison, Gengshi's elder brother, Shi Fengwu (28), came to visit and inquired about the money owed. He discovered that the two had committed suicide by taking poison. He called out to the residents, hired a car, and sent them to Renji Hospital for treatment. The hospital reported the suicide to the Xiafei Road Police Station, who sent detectives to investigate. They found an empty opium box in the house and reported back to the head detective. Since Shen had taken less poison, the doctor was able to induce vomiting and save him. He was discharged from the hospital at dawn and returned home to recuperate. However, Shi Gengshi had taken a larger dose of poison, and the effects of the drug had spread too deeply. She died at noon the next day. The hospital notified the French Police Station, who sent detective Zhang Chunsheng to transport the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for an autopsy. The deceased's father, Shi Shunjin, heard the news and came to Shanghai from Wusong. Yesterday, the police reported to the Second Special District Court Prosecutor's Office. Chief Prosecutor Chen Bei San, accompanied by a forensic doctor, examined the body and confirmed that the deceased had died from opium poisoning. The body was handed over to her lover, Shen Chongfa, who signed a guarantee for its burial. The Renji Hospital diagnosis report and the opium box were kept on file for future reference. After the autopsy, Shen, lacking the means, asked others to donate a burial shroud and coffin.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Japanese-language Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun reported that Kuni Katabara, the concubine of Seizo Kumaizumi, residing at No. 1 Guangyu Lane, Dixiwei Road, was from Kagawa Prefecture, Japan. Suddenly, at 8:00 PM on the 2nd, she swallowed mercury cyanide and committed suicide. Neighbors discovered her and rushed her to Fumin Hospital for treatment, but she had vomited too much blood and could not be saved. The reason for her suicide was that she had met and become involved with Kumaizumi seven years ago, and they had agreed to become husband and wife. Later, she learned that Kumaizumi had a wife and three sons and one daughter in Japan. Since then, she often displayed a negative attitude, but was unwilling to separate from Kumaizumi. This led to arguments between them. Katabara had no parents or siblings in China, and could not marry as promised or return to Japan. She developed a desire to die. A month ago, she purchased a bottle of mercury cyanide from Wanxiang Tang pharmacy on Wusong Road. On the 2nd, while Kumaizumi was out, she took the poison and committed suicide.</p>

The precinct reported the matter to the district, which forwarded it to the Inspectorate. The local bailiff was ordered to report to the local court at 2:00 PM yesterday for an autopsy.

<p>A patrolman shot and wounded a passerby with a stray bullet. Jin Jiulin, the chief inspector of the French Concession Police Department, recently received a report from an informant that a large number of thieves were loitering near the Great World, plotting wrongdoing. He led detectives Qian Yumin, Zhang Ziying, and others to investigate the scene. They arrested four thieves at the entrance of the Gong Wutai and brought them to the police station. Under interrogation, they confessed that they had broken into the Chen residence at 5 Duxing Lane, West Xinqiao, and robbed them of 300 to 400 yuan worth of property last October. There were many other accomplices hiding in 3 Wenyuan Lane, Min Ti Ni Yin Road.

Until 8:00 AM yesterday morning, one of the thieves went to knock on the door. When detective Wu opened the door, the thief saw that something was wrong and turned to flee. He escaped from the back of Wenyuan Lane into Glock Road, then from Glock Road to Pi Shao Nai Road, and then across the Body Ni Yin Road, rushing towards the Xiaobeimen in the Chinese Concession.

<p>To the Esteemed Editor: I was deeply surprised to read in yesterday's (June 3rd) edition of your newspaper about a certain Mr. Gu, a physical education teacher at Dai Youhua Tonggong School, being deceived. I am in charge of physical education at Huatong Public School, and there is no teacher named Gu, nor has there been any deception. I respectfully request a correction. Sincerely, Lu Shentong. June 4th.</p>
<p>To the Editor of the Local News Column: Regarding the news item "Dispute over the Champagne Cup" in today's column, there are sentences concerning the Champagne Cup final that involve the reputation of our association. It is said that because Jiande was too busy to participate, none of the team members attended, and they believed that the Guangdong team would also not attend. However, because the Guangdong team saw that the postponement was not approved, they disregarded integrity and all team members went. Is it disregarding integrity to go because the postponement was not approved? Then, what would be the appropriate course of action to uphold integrity? Therefore, the above statement is clearly a one-sided speculation that is completely inconsistent with the facts. In short, this dispute is between the Jiande team and the Champagne Cup Organizing Committee. Our association does not ask who is right or wrong. However, our association cannot remain silent when someone attempts to harm our association's reputation through this incident. Therefore, we request a correction. We hope for your approval. Sincerely, Lin Rongji, General Affairs Committee Member of the Guangdong Table Tennis Association. June 4, 1934.</p>

<p>Directory Compiled by the Reading Guidance Department of the Shen Bao Circulation Library (1) Future "Reading Questions and Answers" (2) Information! 1. Future "Reading Questions and Answers" 2. Suspension of Self-Study Series</p>
<h3 id="e221">(A) Future Reading Questions and Answers <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>1. Review of Past Work When we review the Reading Questions and Answers work of the past few months, we discovered several shortcomings. To improve future work, make the work more suitable for the needs of the majority of readers, and make it more practical, it is necessary to point them out.</p>
<p>(1) The original purpose of our Reading Questions and Answers was to help young, out-of-school readers to study on their own, but in the past few months, it is clear that the questions we have raised have become increasingly specialized and cannot be understood by ordinary shop assistants and apprentices. As a result, in practice, those who can understand the Reading Questions and Answers are still a small number of readers with higher cultural standards. There is still a long way to go before our work can achieve universalization.</p>
<p>(2) Because the questions we have raised have become increasingly specialized, we have not yet achieved popularization in terms of writing. Although the writers in the Reading Questions and Answers have made the greatest efforts in terms of skill, many specialized terms are still inevitably filled between the lines. This situation often has the tendency to scare away a group of readers with weak comprehension and prevent them from asking us questions.</p>
<p>(3) Our past Reading Questions and Answers did focus on the discussion of general reading methods, but our methods could not be specific, and we often adopted topics with a very large scope and described them in general terms. This is very laborious for the writers, and readers can only get a vague impression of the problem at most.</p>
<p>(4) Although the scope of the questions we have involved is not limited to any one aspect, we have indeed neglected many problems that the public urgently needs to understand, such as commercial knowledge, etc., so that we have benefited a certain group of readers and abandoned other groups of readers.</p>
<p>2. Future Work Guidelines</p>
<p>In the future, we want to make our work more popular and universal. We must use great efforts to correct the shortcomings mentioned above and re-determine our work attitude and guidelines.</p>
<p>(1) Expand the scope of Reading Questions and Answers and conduct a detailed review of all issues related to books and life.</p>
<p>(2) Try to reduce the number of in-depth specialized questions.</p>
<p>(3) Strive for popular writing and avoid the use of specialized terms as much as possible.</p>
<p>(4) The principle of selecting materials is to start with the big picture and focus on the details.</p>
<p>(5) When criticizing a book, maintain an extremely fair and objective attitude, so that readers can understand the good and bad points of the book to the greatest extent.</p>
<p>(6) Make the scope of the questions raised for discussion as practical and concrete as possible. It is necessary to achieve the common needs and understanding ability of the general public, and to discuss them one by one without fear of trouble.</p>
<p>3. Future "Questions and Answers" Content</p>
<p>Therefore, the objective requirements for our future "Questions and Answers" content are:</p>
<p>(1) General review of old novels. (2) Correction of common sense errors. (3) Review of introductory social science reading materials. (4) General review of authoritative works that affect the public. (5) Introduction to natural science. (6) Commercial knowledge. (7) Discussion of research methods for a certain subject. (8) Discussion of general reading methods. (9) Discussion of various practical issues in reading life. (10) Discussion of important issues in magazines and newspapers. (11) Explanation of language and text (B)</p>
<h3 id="e222">Information 1. Unified Correspondence Paper <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>We have received thousands of letters from outside. Because the paper used for the letters is prepared by the correspondents themselves, the letter paper and envelopes are different for each person. Some use foreign paper, some use local paper, and they are of various shapes and sizes. If they are collected together, it is simply possible to open an exhibition of envelopes and letter paper. Recently, some readers have even used red paper or straw paper to write letters, and the handwriting is blurred, making it impossible to read, which has caused us to waste a lot of time and energy reading the letters. This is not to mention it. The most troublesome thing is preservation. We use bags to store and preserve the readers' letters so that we can check them from time to time. But if the sizes are not uniform, it is very troublesome to fold and pack them into bags. Therefore, for the sake of neatness, convenience, and saving time, we always hope that readers can use uniform letter paper and envelopes. Now we are preparing to print a kind of communication paper for readers to use for communication. In this way, both parties will be very convenient in the future. In order to take into account the economic burden of readers, we plan to prepare to print tens of thousands of copies at a time, and the price should be set low, even cheaper than any paper store. We only charge a very low cost for sale, and the style is also practical and beautiful. It will probably be printed as soon as possible in mid-July, and another notice will be issued at that time. We are now scheduled to use this type of letter paper and envelope uniformly from August 1.</p>
<h3 id="e223">2. Suspension of Self-Study Series <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>We have now decided to stop selling the first type of Self-Study Series, "How to Self-Study Social Science," and all other types that are prepared for printing will also be stopped. The entire Self-Study Series has been decided to be temporarily suspended. This is very sorry to everyone. I hope that readers can be especially understanding, and in the future, the guidance on reading methods will be transferred to "Reading Questions and Answers" as much as possible and published sporadically.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Special Article: Refutation of Foreign Misinterpretation of the Pilotage Treaty (3) <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>Declaration of the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Pilotage Association Because according to the above treaties and regulations, the Shanghai Licensed Pilotage Association was officially leased to Captain Daliel (then acting port captain) on July 11, 1903, and funds were provided for him to build and establish a modern pilotage fleet. According to the above-mentioned lease contract, he has the right to do so, and in order to comply with the legal basis, a limited company was established in accordance with Hong Kong law, named Shanghai Pilotage Ship Limited.</p>
<p>The meeting memorandum of the company proves that the business of the pilotage ship owners, namely the Shanghai Pilotage Ship Limited in the previous 1923, has been extremely developed. Only licensed pilots can enjoy the company's shares. The company's capital is 1 million customs gold units, and the standard dividend is 8%. The pilotage fleet is the property of the Shanghai pilots. Therefore, naturally, when the old pilots of the association retire, the new candidates inherit their positions, that is, the latter obtains the shares of the departing members. In the past few years, pilots of all countries have served, and the number is limited to 40. Therefore, the shares of Shanghai Pilotage Ship Limited are also 40, and each share is 25,000 gold units. The usual procedure is that if a pilot expresses his resignation (must give notice nine months in advance), he should specify the nationality of the succeeding pilot, and the general principle is to maintain the original proportion (Translator's note: This means maintaining the British proportion of 50%).</p>
<p>As for the pilot apprentices, after a six-month apprenticeship, they become licensed pilots after passing the necessary examinations and obtain the shares of the predecessors. If the successor pilot cannot pay the cash to purchase the shares, the local bank is happy to lend money to purchase them. However, since the legal status of the association (Translator's note: This refers to the Shanghai Foreign Pilotage Association) has been unstable recently, the bankers have no intention of taking this route again, even though the company's assets are sufficient to provide the necessary guarantee.</p>
<p>The association currently has 40 pilot members, and the distribution of their nationalities is as follows: France 4, Germany 2, Denmark 2, United States 4, Norway 2, Netherlands 1, Italy 1, Japan 4, England 18, China 2.</p>
<p>Now China's proposal is that no licenses will be issued to anyone other than Chinese citizens in the future. However, it must be known that foreigners are not allowed to be pilot trainees at the beginning unless they can obtain a captain's diploma or other equivalent document and prove that they have served as captain for at least one year, and have a health certificate from the medical team designated by the Pilotage Board.</p>
<p>On the contrary, China's selection of pilot apprentices is entirely entrusted to the port captain, who consults with the management committee to determine the navigation qualifications of each Chinese candidate and decide whether he is suitable for the position of pilot apprentice. It can be clearly said here that no Chinese can have the same qualifications as foreigners.</p>
<p>At this point, we hope that we have already explained that if the Chinese government abolishes the existing Pilotage Board (which is composed of representative consuls, representatives of foreign chambers of commerce, the port captain, and the manager of the Shanghai Licensed Pilotage Association) and replaces it with a new committee composed of the customs inspectors, port captain, representatives of the staff department, representatives of the navy, representatives of the Ministry of Communications, representatives of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, and representatives of foreign chambers of commerce, then treaty obligations will inevitably be violated. Moreover, this kind of attempt will cause several important problems. Now let us detail one or two of them as follows:</p>
<p>First, according to the total pilotage in 1932, foreign ships accounted for 81% of the total tonnage of 34 million tons of ships entering and leaving the port, while China only accounted for 6.3 million tons. Therefore, it can be seen that the interests of foreigners here are huge.</p>
<p>Except for the giant ships that cross the Atlantic Ocean, all kinds of ships now go to Shanghai (that is, the Queen Mary, which is 42,000 tons, has also traveled around the world and passed through Wusong).</p>
<p>The pilots who lead these ocean-going ships are responsible for 50 to 70 nautical miles of navigation, passing through changeable waterways and crowded inner harbors. Their work requires a high degree of skill, and the huge personal risks they take (such as climbing large ships at sea) are not counted. No foreign shipping company is willing to entrust the navigation of their giant ships to pilots who do not have at least the qualifications stipulated for foreign pilot trainees. Moreover, the ship insurance company will not be willing to charge the same rate for hull and cargo insurance because pilots who do not have the necessary qualifications are serving as navigators on the bridge. In short, the navigation from the river mouth to the port is a difficult and dangerous task. In this case, the larger ships may return to the inconvenient practice of the past, loading and unloading cargo and passengers at the Wusong anchorage.</p>
<p>According to certain special regulations, shipping companies can freely refuse a particular pilot, but this kind of refusal has always been rare because the Shanghai Licensed Pilotage Association has always been able to maintain its high standards. Therefore, it will inevitably lead to long-term and justified opposition to the recruitment of Chinese pilots, unless or until the shipping companies are satisfied with the Chinese pilots and believe that they have the same qualifications as foreign pilots, or at least have the same experience.</p>
<p>Customs officials have indicated that if the Chinese government can guarantee the payment of all pilotage shares when each pilot resigns or dies, the Pilotage Association is willing to hand over all pilotage fleets to the Chinese government without compensation. However, we observe the so-called shipping bureau, a semi-official Chinese business, regarding the treatment of foreign captains with regard to the earned pensions and gifts. Without satisfactory guarantees, it is not enough to make the pilots believe and dare to do so. After all, most of these people have invested most of their life savings in the shares of the Pilotage Ship Company, or even borrowed money for this purpose.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is the issue of the pilot's liability. According to China's existing maritime law, the judgments of Chinese courts on accidents and errors are not satisfactory.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the issue of security in Shanghai. In the past ten years, the great powers have twice had to urgently dispatch troops to reinforce Shanghai to maintain its internal order. If this reinforcement is delayed due to the unwillingness or refusal of Chinese pilots to lead the ships carrying these reinforcements into the port, then the matter is unbearable. But if the pilotage affairs are transferred to the hands of the Chinese after the abolition of the foreign pilots, then this should be regarded as a future possibility. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e225">National Sports Advancement Association's Stadium to Be Recovered at the End of the Month <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>The Sports Advancement Association has received a formal notice and is now preparing for the closure and relocation. In the future, the Sports Advancement Association will temporarily move to the Shen Garden Stadium.</p>
<p>The rumor that the entire stadium of the China National Sports Advancement Association on Route Père Robert, French Concession, will be recovered by the landowner, the American Rockefeller Foundation, and donated to the National Shanghai Medical College for the construction of a hospital, has been circulating for a long time. It is now ripe. According to a person in charge of the Sports Advancement Association, they have received a formal notice of the recovery of the land, with a deadline for closure and relocation by the end of this month. Therefore, the Sports Advancement Association is now preparing for the closure and relocation.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Stadium Area and Future Arrangements <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>The entire land area is more than 110 acres, east to Juqin Road, south to Kangdi Road, north to Route Père Robert, and west to the west side of Route Sapey Sai to the University of Shanghai. However, it would be excessive to build a hospital and medical college on such a large area of land. The football field on the west side has been leased by the French Bureau of Public Works to build a Chinese Children's Middle School. The tennis court on the south side (behind the baseball field) will also be leased by others and continue to be used as a tennis court. However, this matter has not yet reached the stage of formal announcement, and the names are not convenient to be disclosed.</p>
<h3 id="e227">A Brief History of the Sports Advancement Association's Takeover <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>The National Sports Advancement Association was established in 1924. It was initially located in an office on the third floor of this building. In 1925, it took over the entire stadium area along the current Route Père Robert from the foreigners Gray and Glover. At the beginning of the takeover, in order to make up for the 10,000 yuan debt owed by the foreigners, Mr. Cheng Yi donated 10,000 yuan. Therefore, Mr. Cheng's contribution to the Sports Advancement Association's takeover of the stadium was very significant.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Writing Office Temporarily Moves to Shen Garden Stadium <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>After ten years of difficult management, the talk of repossession has been rife for the past four or five years. The National Sports Advancement Association, without pursuing competition in terms of actual strength, has now officially been repossessed. The association will henceforth use Shen Garden as its base, and the writing office will also be moved there. This is all the association has prepared. However, Shen Garden only has one football field. At most, three or four more tennis courts can be built. Moreover, the land is of a temporary nature. Currently, no one wants this land, so it is being borrowed for the time being without paying rent. A certain percentage of the ticket revenue will be shared.</p>
<h3 id="e229">Ten Years of Effort Ruined in One Day <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>The work done by the National Sports Advancement Association over the past eleven years is self-evident and need not be elaborated upon. The entire Shanghai sports community regards the repossession of the Rue Pere Robert grounds as a great regret. The fact that the baseball field (a general term for the entire Rue Pere Robert sports grounds) remains unused after ten years of management can only be attributed to the National Sports Advancement Association's inability to make a decisive effort for the cause. Let bygones be bygones, the future is yet to come. Whether the association can now resolve to formulate a grand strategy for the benefit of the entire sports community is a matter that brooks no delay.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Hoping for a New Development <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>From the perspective of the association's own activities, having a sports ground is not essential. The presence or absence of a venue is arguably irrelevant. However, the association's funding has to rely on the income from match tickets for support. This is why the Advancement Association needs a sports ground. Furthermore, the Shanghai sports community greatly hopes that the Advancement Association can have a perfect sports ground. Now that the Rue Pere Robert land has been repossessed, whether the association's future activities can see a new development is a matter worthy of attention.</p>
<h3 id="e231">China Defeats Xieqiao by a Large Margin <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>First-class players absent, still win by a large margin of twelve to three. The make-up match between the China Lawn Tennis Club and the Xieqiao General Association in the lawn tennis league was held yesterday afternoon at the China Tennis Court. Although the China Club's first-class players were unable to attend due to other commitments and only second and third-rate players represented them, the China Club still emerged victorious, winning by a large margin of twelve to three. The results are as follows: (1) Wang Wenzheng and Sun Linfang (China) (7-5, 6-3, 6-4) defeated Lan Silian and Kaiseisi (Xieqiao); (2) Guo Yujie and Ma Anquan (China) (6-3, 5-7, 11-9) defeated Robert Sheng and Hui Erque (Xieqiao); (3) Zhou Guanjun and Zhang Dingzhao (China) (6-3, 6-0, 6-2) defeated La Aituo and Bei Detuo (Xieqiao); (4) Zheng Zirong and Huang Jinxi (China) (6-8, 6-4, 4-6) lost to Hagesisi and Siluogu (Xieqiao); (5) Tang Yongchun and Mao Hongfa (China) (6-4, 6-4, 6-3) defeated Ma Xuerli and Wensi Dong (Xieqiao). Groups three and five won the easiest and ended the earliest. The other three groups saw intense competition, especially the first group, which was particularly fierce. The two veterans of Xieqiao, bald and white-haired, Lan Silian was the Shanghai singles champion twenty years ago and still retains his prowess. His net play is fierce and frightening, reminiscent of his past glory. Robert Sheng in the second group is newly arrived from England and is promising. Huang Jinxi in the fourth group is the singles champion of St. John's University, short and wiry, but with remarkable skills.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Sports Conference Opens Today <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>

<h3 id="e233">Zhu Kuan and Hong Yukui Win the Open Handball Doubles Championship <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's competition was the final act of the first Shanghai Open Doubles Handball Championship. Zhu Kuan and Hong Yukui had won every match, and yesterday they reached the final against the Western representatives Chabo and Kalianbo Aisaili. After three fierce games, they finally overcame their strong opponents. Thus, the championship was won by Zhu and Hong. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e234">First Game <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>In the first game, Chabo served and scored four points. Zhu and Hong immediately caught up and surpassed them to a score of ten to four. The score was once tied at ten points each. Then, Hong's spirits rose, and he scored several consecutive points, leading with a score of seventeen to five. Although Chabo tried his best to counterattack, he achieved nothing and eventually lost to Zhu and Hong with a score of fifteen to twenty.</p>
<h3 id="e235">Second Game <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>In the second game, each side scored four points first. Then, the situation changed, and Chabo cooperated well, scoring many points consecutively and taking the lead with a score of fifteen to six. Soon, Hong and Zhu chased after them, reaching a score of fifteen to twenty. However, Chabo then gained momentum again and surpassed them by nine points. Later, Zhu scored three points consecutively, but the result was still a victory for Chabo with a score of twenty-one to twelve.</p>
<h3 id="e236">Third Game <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>Chabo served again in the third game, scoring as many as eleven consecutive points. Zhu and Hong felt quite difficult. They only scored three points when their opponents reached twelve points. The situation became one-sided. However, Zhu and Hong's spirits were lifted, and they displayed their skills in striking, saving, and running, chasing all the way to a score of ten to twelve. Seeing the situation was not good, Chabo changed his tactics and gained a lead of eighteen to ten. At this time, the audience was worried for Zhu and Hong. Then, Hong shouted and scored several balls consecutively. He also added points when he did not serve, until the score was seventeen to eighteen. Although Chabo had a chance to serve at this time, he gained nothing. Instead, Zhu and Hong surpassed him by one point. Then, the situation reversed again, and Chabo created a score of twenty to nineteen. However, he was eventually defeated by Zhu with an extraordinary strike, winning the final victory and winning the doubles championship in this competition.</p>
<p>Zhu Kuan and Hong Yukui (21-5, 13-21, 21-22) defeated Chabo and Kalianbo Aisaili.</p>

<p>Held at the Shanghai Race Club. The Shanghai China Lawn Tennis Association has been sponsoring the Xian Fang Cup Tennis League for years and is the only national tennis organization in this city. As the green grass is lush and the tennis season is about to begin again, the association's secretary, Lu Xibiao, in order to proceed with all association matters, has already sent letters to the previous committee members Fang Bofen, Hu Qizhuo, Gu Jiaqi, Ling Xitao, Chen Shao, Zhang Zizhen, etc., setting the meeting for five-thirty in the afternoon on the eighth of this month (Friday) at the Shanghai Race Club on Ma Huo Road to discuss the proceedings.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 4th) Hao Gengsheng stated, regarding reports that the Philippine Sports Association has recognized the dissolution of the Far Eastern Games, that this may be Japanese propaganda and is not yet confirmed. However, we will not be taken advantage of by them. The Ministry of Education and the Training and Supervision Department have agreed to stipulate that junior high schools use Boy Scout training in place of military training, with three hours per week, each hour requiring two hours of extracurricular activities, as a compulsory course for three years. Elementary schools will use extracurricular activities in place of military training. Implementation measures for military training in high schools and universities will be announced soon.</p>

<p>The Zhongbin Cup Football Championship, initiated by Mr. Zhang, owner of the Goods Exchange and Fuxing Gold Shop, seems to have already determined the winner since the start of the competition. The first match between Fuxing and Xinya started, and there was heavy rain that day. Fuxing players were thus hindered, and the referee did not arrive. According to the rules, the match should have been postponed, but Fuxing, as the host, feared that other teams would be unwilling, and they sacrificed their right to a forfeit. The final between Fuxing and Xinxin is scheduled for next Sunday, and the venue is still being negotiated. The results of the Zhongbin Cup are as follows:</p>

<p>Yesterday, telegrams were sent to the National Government and other organizations, requesting serious negotiations and assistance. The Nagasaki Kyushu Overseas Chinese United Association urgently telegraphed the National Government regarding the "tragic case of Japanese students killing our overseas Chinese student, Ye Muhua."</p>
<p>To the National Government, various ministries, the Central Party Headquarters, the Military Affairs Commission, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, domestic and overseas organizations, newspapers, and fellow countrymen:</p>
<p>The deceased student, Ye Muhua, was originally from Fuqing County, Fujian Province, and was 19 years old. He resided in Kumamoto City and graduated from Jikei Junior High School in that city. He was an excellent student and received awards from the school. Ye Muhua, concerned about the weakness of his motherland, intended to join the revolution and enlist in the military. He planned to return to China to apply to the Nanjing Military Academy for further study and to serve his country. However, due to his lack of proficiency in Mandarin, he came to the Nagasaki Overseas Chinese Shizhong School with his brother in April to improve his Mandarin. He was of pure character, upright conduct, diligent, and eager to learn. All the students loved and respected him, and the teachers praised his excellent character and scholarship.</p>
<p>On May 23rd, at 3:00 PM, after school, as he was returning home, he encountered a Japanese middle school student who insulted and cursed him without reason. Ye Muhua questioned the Japanese student, who fled when he realized he was wrong. The next day, at noon, as he was passing by the Nagasaki Trade and Commercial School in Higashiyamachi, he saw two people in Western clothes, who seemed to be teachers, and four or five students playing ball. When they saw Ye Muhua and his brother, they blocked their way and cursed them again. Among them were the two who had insulted him the day before. Ye Muhua tried to go to school, but the Japanese students were extremely violent. One of them attacked Ye Muhua with an air gun. Ye Muhua questioned him, but another Japanese student punched him. Ye Muhua had no choice but to defend himself. Unexpectedly, the Japanese student pulled out a dagger and stabbed Ye Muhua in the left chest, hitting his heart. He died instantly.</p>
<p>The above situation was witnessed by his younger brother who was traveling with him. We, the members of this association, deeply saddened by the tragic nature of the case, convened a joint meeting of local overseas Chinese organizations. We unanimously decided to, in addition to petitioning the Chinese Consulate in Nagasaki to negotiate seriously with the Japanese authorities, telegraph all compatriots at home and abroad to unite and assist us. Driven by our conscience and overwhelmed by indignation, we vow not to rest until a satisfactory resolution is reached. This is not only to comfort the soul of the deceased but also to ensure the safety of overseas Chinese in the future.</p>
<p>Considering our limited capabilities, we respectfully request the support of all sectors of society. We await your urgent and decisive response.</p>
<p>Kyushu Overseas Chinese United Association, 10 Shinchi-machi, Nagasaki City.</p>

<p>Cultivate Young People's Habit of Serving the Public Through Practical Work.</p>
<p>It is hoped that reference will be made to the regulations of Jiangxi Province and methods will be formulated for consistent implementation.</p>
<p>On the 2nd, Chairman Chiang telegraphed the Education Departments of various provinces and the Education Bureau of Shanghai, ordering students of public and private middle schools and above to use their vacation time to serve society. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>To the Education Departments of various provinces, the Municipal Government, and the Education Bureau of Shanghai:</p>
<p>In the past, our country's education has emphasized textbook knowledge, paying little attention to group training and the cultivation of a spirit of service. As a result, the people prioritize private interests over public ones and are characterized by laziness and apathy, which has become a common practice. If we want to reverse this decline and restore the virtues of helping others and working together for the benefit of society, we must cultivate young people's habit of serving the public through practical work. It is essential to understand that knowledge is for the public good, not for selfish purposes. Society must rely on mutual assistance to solidify its foundation. Therefore, the revival of the nation must begin with the promotion of a spirit of service to society.</p>
<p>Now, at the beginning of the New Life Movement, with the aim of reforming the old and embracing the new, practical advocacy is needed. Zhongzheng believes that all students of public and private middle schools and above throughout the country should use their vacations to provide various practical services in their hometowns. Whether it is cleaning, sanitation, public places, or private homes, as well as other efforts to reform bad habits and benefit the countryside, students can identify projects, adopt an amiable and sincere attitude, and use persuasion and investigation to serve the community. The aim is to inspire society and change the atmosphere. After the vacation, students will return to school, report on their work, and be assessed and encouraged. Not only will the countryside be improved, but students will also have the opportunity to get close to real society and practice working with the public. Education will then be truly valuable.</p>
<p>The Education Department of Jiangxi Province has already established a Youth Vacation Service Corps, with very comprehensive methods. As the summer vacation is approaching, it is hoped that the Education Departments and Bureaus of various provinces and cities will refer to the regulations of Jiangxi Province, consider the local conditions, convene meetings with the relevant authorities of various schools to formulate methods, and implement them consistently. The revival of the nation must begin with this. I have high expectations. In addition to the Service Corps methods, which will be sent separately by the Jiangxi Education Department, I hereby issue this telegram.</p>

<p>President Pan Speaks on Children's Reading Materials</p>
<p>Pan Gongzhan, president of Children's Morning News, recently sent a letter to the Elementary School Principals' Association requesting advisors to assist. The association nominated Chen Jicheng, Feng Yixian, Weng Guomou, Wu Zhimu, Huang Daping, Sun Yucai, Zhang Lingfei, Feng Xiancheng, Cui Jianwu, Jin Yuezhang, Zhang Xiaotian, Wu Yao, Cheng Qian, Pan Renwei, Qi Jueshen, Hu Changying, Zhu Xitian, Zhu Changli, Shen Xibin, Hu Yihong, and Yao Chunxu as advisors. The first meeting was held yesterday at the YMCA on Sichuan Road. Chen Jicheng chaired the meeting, and Sun Yucai recorded the minutes. Pan Gongzhan, president of the newspaper, and Hu Shuyi, the editor, attended the meeting. First, President Pan gave a speech on the issue of children's reading materials, stating that children should be provided with good extracurricular reading materials in addition to textbooks so that they can make progress in their studies. There are many extracurricular reading materials on the market, but they are usually published every few days, which is not very convenient. Children's Morning News is published every Monday and Thursday, although it is also published every three days, but the content and materials are quite rich. Originally, Children's Morning News was a newspaper that children could see every morning. We hope that everyone will support it so that it can prosper. In the future, if it truly becomes a daily newspaper, the purpose of our running this newspaper is to try our best to suit children's physical and mental needs and provide children with good extracurricular reading materials. The content is constantly being reformed every day, so that it can make progress every day and complete its original mission. I hope everyone will (1) advise on methods that are common to all children, (2) teachers will lead children to contribute, and (3) regard it as a must-read for children outside of class and a newspaper shared by teachers and students.</p>

<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling of Qing, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>After they played music and escorted the Empress Dowager onto her palanquin, train, or other means of transportation, in short, as long as the Empress Dowager left the place where they were playing music and started to head elsewhere, they had to pack up all the instruments, rush ahead to the destination to wait, and then play the same music they had played during the send-off to welcome her. This kind of farcical act also had a special term, called "receiving the Empress Dowager."</p>
<p>I loved playing with these musical instruments, especially because I was quite interested in the history of each of them. Therefore, in this chapter of the book, I will specifically describe them one by one, like the "eight tones" mentioned in the previous chapter. At the same time, I also have a very clear understanding and firmly believe that several of these ancient musical instruments are the ancestors of the new-style musical instruments that are currently popular around the world, just like humans evolved from apes.</p>
<p>Among these musical instruments is the "qing" (磬), or perhaps a gong. The "qing" is also one of the "eight tones," and its style has been described in the previous chapter. The real instrument and the patterns embroidered on the yellow satin are exactly the same, so we don't need to repeat it. The purpose of this instrument is to harmonize the rhythm, making the music of the entire ensemble sometimes slow and sometimes fast, so that there is no monotony. Originally, the music played at that time was very peculiar; it seemed that there was no fixed beat, and modern people may not feel any interest in it. But the solemn and reverent tones it emitted, although they sounded very monotonous and unpleasant to your ears, would definitely evoke a different kind of feeling in your soul. This is the characteristic of ancient Chinese music. (49)</p>
<h3 id="e269">Ballad of the Lute <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— Yanqiao</p>
<p>Bai Letian's "Ballad of the Lute" is a masterpiece describing the art of sound, so the Lute Pavilion in Jiujiang has become a well-known historical site. Whenever poets and writers passed by there, they would always recite the line "We are both people fallen from the ends of the earth" in a low voice, expressing sympathy for Bai Letian and the merchant's wife. Once, I casually told this poem to my students, and one of them raised a question, believing that Bai Letian was the current local official at the time. How could he presumptuously board the boat of a married woman to appreciate her wonderful skills? At the time, I only said that Letian probably didn't mind the impropriety because she was a former courtesan, but I didn't have a very strong defense. Later, I saw Hong Rongzhai's "Three Brushstrokes," and he also had the same criticism. He said: "Letian moved his boat and boarded her boat at night to drink, without any reservations. Isn't it because she was a former singing girl from Chang'an, so he didn't find it objectionable?" This was similar to my idea. He also cited that in the "Changqing Collection," when he was a banished official in Xunyang, he also had a similar amorous encounter when passing through Ezhou. Rongzhai believed that the Tang people did not criticize such things as being like being under a melon vine or a plum tree. However, "Five Brushstrokes" also said: "Although the laws of the Tang Dynasty were lenient in this regard, Letian had served in secret positions and had not been banished for long. He would definitely not dare to enter the boat of a woman alone at night to drink and enjoy the music to the fullest, and leave only in the middle of the night. Wouldn't he worry that the merchant would criticize him in the future?" Therefore, he suspected that it was a fabrication, only expressing the sorrow of being fallen from the ends of the earth, and that there was no such person or event. Then isn't it like being fooled by the tomb of Feng Xiaoqing on West Lake for seven or eight hundred years?</p>
<p>Many poems about the Lute Pavilion are perfunctory, borrowing other people's wine glasses to pour out their own sorrows. Only Guo Mingfu, a Sichuan poet in the Chunxi period of the Song Dynasty, said: "Regardless of whether people want to kill him, he listens to the lute on the river late at night." He also said: "How could this gentleman have young and crazy dreams? He drifts along with the world, treating it casually." He was able to expose Letian's inner thoughts.</p>
<h3 id="e270">Rice Riot <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>A certain middle school principal, a believer in the Nationalist Party, especially admired Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Since a report once mentioned that Chairman Chiang advocated washing noodles with cold water and eating cold rice, he implemented it in the school he ran. He believed that eating cold rice was even more important than washing noodles with cold water, so he first trained the students to eat cold rice. When the students first ate cold rice, they felt very unaccustomed to it. It was cold and hard, and it was really difficult to swallow. After two or three weeks, they finally got used to it, but they still couldn't forget hot rice. The students' secret curses against the principal, of course, could not be completely eliminated. As for the principal himself, he was initially full of courage and ate cold rice every meal as an example. Gradually, his courage diminished, and once his courage retreated, he felt that cold rice did not suit his appetite and was difficult to swallow. So he secretly ate hot rice behind his back. As luck would have it, one time when he was holding steaming hot rice, a student suddenly discovered his secret, instantly making him like Liu Bei dropping his chopsticks in shock. The student spread the word, and the whole school knew, so a rice riot broke out in the dining hall. At the next meal, the students all refused to eat cold rice and demanded hot rice instead. The teachers tried to persuade them, but they didn't listen. Instead, they rioted, with shouts and the sound of breaking bowls echoing together. The principal rushed over to stop them, but he only encountered their anger. Bowls and plates flew towards the principal's head, and the principal fled with his head in his hands like a rat. From then on, the school stopped eating cold rice.</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 29</p>
<p>Returning to Shanxi with a Sad Heart, Aiming for Du Huo. Listening to the Blood Oath, Vowing Loyalty. If other people attack us and we don't even resist, that would be too difficult. With Lord Guan here, I'll take an oath first. Saying that, he dipped a finger into the bowl of blood, then took it out and smeared it on his mouth. Only then did he say solemnly: This is the ancient method of a blood oath, indicating that the words spoken will never be regretted. Now I'll borrow this ancient method to prove myself. I, Shi Fang, am now guarding Ping'an Village, and Ping'an Village is my life. As long as I'm here, Ping'an Village must remain. Saying that, he pointed with his hand and said: Look, those four words up there. Everyone looked up and saw a horizontal plaque on top of the shrine, with the four words "Absolute Loyalty Illuminates the Sun" written on it. Shi Fang said: Did you see it? "Absolute Loyalty Illuminates the Sun." This is a common saying in the Guan Sheng Temple. Now we should pay attention to it. Only with absolute loyalty can we illuminate the sun. What about you? The four company commanders all replied: We listen to the battalion commander's orders and serve the country with absolute loyalty. So Yin Deren first walked out from his original place, dipped a finger into the blood bowl, and smeared it on the corner of his mouth. The other three company commanders followed suit. Battalion Commander Shi was always afraid that the four company commanders would take this matter as a child's play, so at this time, he kept his face stern and his eyes straight. When he saw that the four company commanders had all taken the blood oath, he said again with a solemn expression: Since the four company commanders came to Ping'an Village, I have repeatedly told you to swear to live and die together. At that time, it naturally seemed like we would do what we said, but as time went on, even I, including myself, inevitably became a little lax. After this oath, we should cheer up and work hard. As long as we have breath, we can't lose to the enemy. The four company commanders all agreed again. Only then did Shi Fang salute them and bid them farewell. Everyone walked out of the company headquarters, inevitably with a look of excitement on their faces. (400)</p>
<h3 id="e272">Feeling of Summer <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>First, I saw a girl on the tram wearing straw sandals (said to be tight shoes) with bare feet, her lips blood red, her face brown, her cheeks the color of small yellow croakers, her arms exposed outside her black gauze short sleeves, her whole body's muscles seeming ready to burst out of her clothes, her left hand clutching a white leather bag, and her right hand waving a small handkerchief incessantly. Supposedly, this is her way of coping with the heat? Next, I saw two people walking on the edge of the street, dressed in green with red trim, their hats shaped like soup pots, like "clowns" in a "Western magic show." The words "Lin Wen X Flower Water" were attached to their chests and backs. They held a glass tray with many small bottles inside. It was a live advertisement hired by foreign merchants. Even small citizens who couldn't afford "47111 Perfume" could drip a few drops of this flower water. The way foreigners treat Chinese people can be described as "considerate to the extreme." I don't know if my fellow countrymen also feel "flattered and surprised"?</p>
<p>Dockworkers no longer carry sacks so smoothly, panting five or six times per minute. Water drips from their messy hair, as if they haven't taken a lotus shower. Not long ago, they felt affection for the sun, but now they "hate it to the bone." Running home from the furnace-like outside, my wife is taking a nap. I deeply sympathize with her hardship in catching bedbugs at night, so I don't scold her. Suddenly, I discovered a black spot on her face. Thinking it was coal ash, I was about to take a towel to wipe it off for her, but the black spot suddenly flapped its wings and flew away. How strange! Later, a red dot flew and landed on her forehead. Examining it, it was a mosquito sucking human blood. I angrily killed it. In the evening, in the alley, some people were dragging wooden benches, some were eating stinky tofu, and some were cursing their daughters as "little b*tches." I was unmoved. I lit a stick of incense, straightened my clothes, sat upright, and read the "Spring and Autumn Annals." Suddenly, there was a "buzzing" sound near my ear. I waved my hand to drive it away, coughed to scare it away, but to no avail. I secretly thought that flies like stinky things. Am I a stinky person? So I decided to "fast and bathe" to avoid these clowns from messing with me.</p>
<p>The above is all my feeling of summer.</p>
<h3 id="e273">Banana Tree <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>An old saying: "In the deep courtyard, the curtain hangs down, and people nap during the day, with red roses reflecting the green banana tree." Another saying: "The cherries are red, and the banana trees are green." This wall's eastern green, it is indeed the best flower of today.</p>
<p>Banana trees are perennial plants, eight or nine feet tall, with soft stems and overlapping skins, green on the outside and white on the inside. The leaves are very long and large. When one leaf unfolds, another leaf withers and does not fall. Like chrysanthemums that do not shed their petals in autumn, they are both beautiful objects in the garden. They bloom after three years, with irregular petals, light yellow in color. The fruit hangs down and is long, that is the banana, but it does not ripen except in hot places.</p>
<p>Banana trees have many different names: sweet banana, bajiao, and also called fan fairy, because the leaves can be made into fans and they stretch and flutter, like a fan waving. Therefore, Li Yuxi of the Tang Dynasty has the line "The banana tree unfolds a green fan," and Yang Wanli has the line "Countless green silk fans around the body," which is a very appropriate metaphor. There are many different varieties, and the beauty banana is petite and exquisite, with dense and beautiful flowers, making it an indispensable item in gardens. Ganzhou produces phoenix tail bananas, and Fuzhou has iron bananas, which are said to be grown by mixing iron filings with soil. Goat horn bananas have sharp fruits, shaped like goat horns. Board bananas bear fruit with a bland taste. Buddha hand bananas have small and sweet fruits, commonly called banana seeds. Chicken bananas are especially fragrant, tender, and delicious, treasured in the south. Water bananas do not bear fruit. Bottle bananas have a particularly large body, and gradually taper upwards, until the leaves open wide, long, large, and green, just like several banana leaves inserted in a bottle. Planting them in pavilions and halls is deeply pleasing to the eye, and it is also called elephant hoof banana, saying it is like an elephant's hoof. Many families in Guangdong plant bananas, weave them like hemp, and weave them into clothing, which is more beautiful than kudzu, called banana cloth. Ryukyu even has banana cloth, which is slightly brown. The Japanese take it and glue it to screens, which is very elegant.</p>
<p>Raindrops dripping on banana trees, the sound is rustling. However, when melancholy people hear it, they are saddened and moved, unable to control themselves. Therefore, the melody of Yue opera has a section called "Raindrops on Banana Tree." Football king Li Huitang liked to play the moon lute and often played "Raindrops on Banana Tree" in the quiet depths of night to relieve his feelings. It is also mentioned in his memoir of illness.</p>
<p>My teacher, Mr. Shi Yu, once wrote to the lyricist Jing Yun, mentioning the charm of the banana tree, which is worth pondering. The letter said: "My small building has been planted with banana trees for several years, and now it is as tall as the building. Its leaves that have unfolded for half a month are dark green, and those that have not unfolded for ten days are slightly less green. Those that have just unfolded for one or two days are light green, interspersed with light yellow, as pure as an autumn river and as charming as spring willows. Whenever there is morning dew or moonlight at night, I push open the window of the small building and lean on the railing of the small window. A kind of beautiful scenery and clear shadow often permeates the inkstone, books, dressing table, and mirror. My family only has this one small building left. Is it not what is called a small scene in a room? Wang Yuchen's 'Bamboo Tower Chronicle' says: 'Summer is suitable for heavy rain, with the sound of waterfalls; winter is suitable for dense snow, with the sound of broken jade.' I also say of banana trees: 'Now it is high summer, and the scorching sun is frightening, but my empty courtyard is like a green curtain, with dense shade, and I benefit greatly from it.'"</p>
<p>However, his friend Du Yu painted an oil painting last summer, inviting me to see it. In the center, a huge banana leaf was fluttering and unfolding, its green color flowing, with a naked woman resting in its shade. The leaves were bathed in sunlight, reflecting the skin of the naked woman, all green. It was beautiful beyond compare, a feast for the eyes.</p>
<p>"Records of Superfluous Things" has a commentary on banana trees, saying: "Green windows reflect each other, but it is better to choose short ones, because tall ones are easily broken by the wind. In winter, some people remove the stems and cover them with straw. After three years, they will bloom and produce honeydew. Those that are used as potted plants are even more laughable, not as elegant as palm trees."</p>
<p>Ancient people's paintings emphasized intention over reality, so many paintings do not depict the four seasons. In Yuan An's painting "Lying in the Snow," there are banana trees in the snow. Gao Qi's poem "The poet's daytime with banana trees and snow in the cold pond" refers to this.</p>
<p>The monk Huai Su learned calligraphy without paper, so he planted ten thousand banana trees for writing, calling his residence the Green Sky Hermitage. Also, Zhao Chun, of the Southern Han Dynasty, planted banana trees in his pavilions and halls, which were called "Banana Tree Fanatic." He can be compared to He Jing's plums, Yuan Ming's chrysanthemums, Lian Xi's lotuses, and Zi Lian's bamboos, all beautiful for thousands of years.</p>
<p>"Tough Gourd Collection" says: Someone once summoned a fairy, putting a banana leaf in his sleeve. When asked to write a poem about it, the fairy wrote: "Deeply hidden in the sleeve is a green leaf, knowing that you intend to insult the divine spirit. Tonight, try listening to the rain on the banana tree, dripping for a long time, with a double sound." The mythology of the banana tree is enough for conversation.</p>
<p>Banana trees can be divided into small plants for planting. If you use a hairpin to pierce two holes to let out the air, they will be short and graceful, never growing tall, which is what you want for potted plants.</p>

<h3 id="e274">On Deception <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— Dong Ruo</p>
<p>Deception is usually regarded as an immoral thing, but in our society, there are endless facts of deception. Therefore, in our newspapers, we can get many records of deception every day. The law considers some deceptions, such as the abduction of women and the defrauding of money, as criminal acts, and imposes severe punishments and heavy fines. However, this cannot eliminate or reduce the occurrence of deception.</p>
<p>Why is this? Is it because deceptive people have a dishonest nature? Is it because people like Long Bu and Luo Su have skulls with unavoidable criminal behavior, as they said? The question does not seem to be that simple. Here, we should first examine the nature of deception. Obviously, deception is a distortion of facts, a conscious distortion in an attempt to achieve some benefit, directly or indirectly obtaining some benefit from the object being deceived. Therefore, the act of deception itself carries the division and contradiction between the deceiver and the deceived. Therefore, in a society, if the molecules that make up its interior contradict and conflict with each other more in terms of interests, the task played by deception will become more complex and important. Based on this, we can know that the reason why there are more deception incidents in the cities of capitalist societies than in feudal societies is not simply due to the frequent contact between individuals, but the most important reason is that individualism, free competition, and the contradictions and conflicts between people under capitalism have deepened compared to the previous feudal society.</p>
<p>Knowing that deception is not due to people's dishonest nature, or some innate criminal skull, but the social basis on which it occurs, we can easily understand further: deception is not only the use of one person by another, but sometimes even becomes one of the weapons of one group against another group. When Country A and Country B are at daggers drawn, Country A uses its own news agency to spread rumors, saying that Country B's border troops have mutinied. When two political parties compete in an election, they each issue empty checks to the public and raise the banner of seeking welfare for the people. Aren't these all acts of deception?</p>
<p>Because deception plays a huge role in this society, the art of deception is very necessary to study. A person wearing tattered clothes woos a noble lady, saying that he has a huge fortune at home. This is a deception that anyone can detect, and it is simply not worth talking about as an art.</p>
<p>The highest art of deception is a great truth on the surface, but with deception as its core.</p>
<p>This highest art of deception has been used by the powerful throughout human history...</p>

<h3 id="e276">Mourning Lu Yin (Continued) <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— Lanru, sent from Changsha</p>
<p>It was the winter before last year when I went to Sandefang to see Xiao Lu. She said to me:</p>
<p>"Xiao Bing, you should go see Lu Yin. She was still asking about you last time she came. She's in a pitiful state now, you should go see her."</p>
<p>"What? Pitiful? Isn't she already married to her little lover and living happily?"</p>
<p>I was greatly surprised to hear her say that she was pitiful.</p>
<p>"Although marriage is happy, the children keep coming, which is killing her!"</p>
<p>"How many has she had now?"</p>
<p>"Although there are only two, she's already..."</p>
<p>I knew what the unspoken words were.</p>
<p>"Alas! Too painful! That's more painful and dangerous than giving birth."</p>
<p>"Isn't it? She said it's so boring and painful to be a woman, it's better to be dead than alive."</p>
<p>I made up my mind several times to go see her, and once I even made an appointment with Ms. Huiqun to have dinner at her house first, then go see Lu Yin, and then everyone go to the arts and crafts fair at the Shanghai Municipal Council Girls' School. Later, I don't know what happened temporarily, and I broke the appointment. I didn't go to Huiqun's house for dinner, but we eventually ran into each other at the fair.</p>
<p>"Where's Lu Yin?" I asked Huiqun.</p>
<p>"She's right in front, did you see her? There, the one wearing the gray qipao is her."</p>
<p>Following her finger, I saw a thin, haggard profile in the distance, and I couldn't help but sigh.</p>
<p>"Do you want to find her?" Huiqun asked me.</p>
<p>"No, there are too many people here, it's not easy to talk. I'll go see her another day."</p>
<p>Alas! Who knew that missing that opportunity to meet, I would never see her again!</p>
<p>Lu Yin, you have gained liberation and left this painful world far behind. But in the nether world, did you ever think of the sadness of your husband and daughter? The three-year-old child, although she doesn't know that you are dead, she thinks you are sleeping and will wake up later. But the misery of this ignorant child is even more heartbreaking!</p>
<p>Lu Yin, because of your death, I was reminded of two good friends, one is Binzhi, whose disappearance and tragic death is known to everyone, and the other is Bingzhi, the late wife of Mr. Lie Wen, who died of the same disease as you. You and Bingzhi were both misdiagnosed by incompetent doctors, which is truly heartbreaking. How insignificant is a woman's life, either dying under knives and guns or being lost in childbirth. I am not someone who enjoys life and fears death, but people who have made considerable contributions to society and have hopes in literature should not die so easily. Your deaths are not only a loss to literature but also a loss to society!</p>
<p>As I write this, it is already the time for the first watch. It is raining heavily outside, with thunder rumbling. I put down my pen and stared blankly at the lightning-flashing sky. Two tears fell from my eyes.</p>
<p>Lu Yin, if you are conscious after death, you should understand my current mood! (End)</p>
<h3 id="e277">Originally the Old Site of Lingguang <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Ge</p>
<p>Anyone who goes to Qufu to seek the traces of the sages will likely visit the Temple of the Duke of Zhou. First, the Duke of Zhou can also be considered a sage, and he was a sage who inherited from the past and ushered in the future after Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu, and before Confucius. It is said that he has a certain position in the orthodox lineage of Confucianism. Secondly, it is said that the current Temple of the Duke of Zhou is the old site of the Lingguang Hall, a place of great righteousness and brilliance. In this way, a desire to visit is naturally formed in the hearts of people who have been baptized by Confucianism.</p>
<p>The temple seems to be outside the East Gate, right? In any case, when I went, I went out from the East Gate. I heard that the former State of Lu was outside this East Gate, with the temple as the center, while the Qufu with the Temple of Confucius as the center was the countryside of the State of Lu at that time. If the Lingguang Hall was within the city of Lu, then Lu could be considered a large country after all. Because going from the East Gate to the Temple of the Duke of Zhou, one has to pass through a vast field.</p>
<p>From the outside, especially standing a little further away, the temple does look like a majestic palace. Uneven ancient trees thickly shade the top of the temple, and in some places, a piece of tiled ridge is sparsely visible. If a few red leaves are added in late autumn, the scenery is somewhat moving. The surrounding red walls have long been dilapidated; one can enter without necessarily going through the gate, so there is no one guarding the temple gate, nor is there any greeting or disturbance to those who enter. Often, a solemn feeling is evoked from a gloomy feeling.</p>
<p>As soon as one enters the gate, the dusty walls and broken windows of the three bays and two corridors, and the overgrown weeds on the small path, all present a desolate scene. Walking in the middle, there is a monument beside the path, erected by Emperor Qianlong or someone else. I don't remember the inscription on it very clearly, I only remember that the second sentence is "Originally the old site of Lingguang," and the rest are some praises, giving visitors an example to believe that this place is the old site of Lingguang Hall. It is unexpected that such a famous place at that time has now become like this. It is no wonder that the disciples of the sages are sighing that rituals are not promoted and need to be restored.</p>
<p>Going up another level is the main hall where the Duke of Zhou lived. It seems that only the Duke of Zhou is sitting in the middle; unlike Confucius, who has many disciples standing on both sides accompanying him, which naturally makes people feel a little too lonely. Although we have never dreamed of what kind of person the Duke of Zhou was, as soon as we see the clay sculpture, we feel as if we have seen him before. A kind of demeanor with a very strong sense of morality, just like the dignified old scholars we often see on the stage. His face is white, and mostly carries some scholarly air. China has always had a warning for scholars who will eventually become officials: "Scholars should not have scholarly air." It seems that it is natural that such a Duke of Zhou is not loved. However, recently the government has decided to allocate a portion of the funds from the national treasury, even when it is in financial difficulty, to repair the temples of Confucius, Mencius, Yan Hui, and the Duke of Zhou, which surprisingly shows an intention to promote scholarly air.</p>
<p>To pay homage to the traces of the sages, one should first go with a heart of admiration. The reason why many ancient places and cities arouse our longing and lingering is mostly because we first have a heart of nostalgia and admiration. What is there about the Duke of Zhou that is worthy of our admiration? What is there about Lingguang Hall that is worthy of our nostalgia and lingering? So, I had no choice but to walk out of the ancient temple gate indifferently, with silent footsteps.</p>
<h3 id="e278">Returning from the "Bamboo Creek Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition" <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— Mu Mutian</p>
<p>"Perhaps in the future, square characters will be abolished altogether, and Chinese characters will be Latinized. But until now, calligraphy is still a kind of art. When doing research on the history of art, calligraphy is also an object." After watching the "Bamboo Creek Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition" and returning from the Lake Society, I thought this way on the way.</p>
<p>The "Bamboo Creek Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition" includes more than 300 works, including the calligraphy of Mr. Shen Yinmo and the paintings of Mr. Shen Maishi. Perhaps because of a special understanding of people, I focused my attention almost entirely on the calligraphy of Mr. Shen Yinmo. Although I often saw Mr. Shen Yinmo's calligraphy in Beijing a few years ago, I had never seen such a rich output as it is now.</p>
<p>However, the quality of artworks cannot be judged by their quantity; the main thing is to see how good they are in quality. I have not studied in detail what kind of society the art of calligraphy is a product of. However, just as classical tragedies have a unique beauty, the art of calligraphy also has its unique beauty. We can study the art of calligraphy from a sociological standpoint. But now is not the time; we don't have that kind of time to spare. However, even now, when we don't have time to consider those issues, we can still see whether calligraphy is good or bad. Art that has life, art that has the creator's creative loyalty, no matter which historical stage it is a product of, will always be moving.</p>

<p>— Cheng Yunping</p>
<p>(1) The pitch-black night occupies our village: the collapsing broken houses rustle in the wind, the nightingale sings softly in the desolate forest, and nocturnal beasts wander in the barren fields. (2) The pitch-black night occupies our village: sleeping people are muttering nonsense, lonely men and women are shedding tears of sorrow by their pillows, and sleepless farmers are anxiously waiting for dawn. (3) Suddenly, the hoarse rooster stretches its neck and crows loudly, startling the lazy people awake from their dreams. The beasts flee into their dens, the nightingale stops singing, and a line of dawn is faintly rising on the horizon!</p>

<p>— Fei</p>
<p>In the winter of this year, I traveled to Nanyang for the second time. I ran from the Philippines, Borneo, and Java to Sumatra. I was much more familiar with Sumatra. About ten years ago, I worked as a secretary in a small place under Deli (1), in the store of my uncle Guan Youguang. I like traveling very much, and I have been to almost all the nearby places. If someone were to ask me to be a guide for a trip to Sumatra now, I would be very satisfied. In addition to traveling, I also had some missions this time: a certain overseas Chinese school in China entrusted me to investigate the current situation of overseas Chinese schools in Nanyang, especially at this time when Nanyang has been hit by the economic panic, and the foundations of overseas Chinese schools are mostly shaken. Also, a certain art and book company entrusted me to take pictures of some scenic spots, historical sites, buildings, and other things in Nanyang and send them to them, in preparation for compiling a Nanyang pictorial. So, along the way, in addition to sightseeing, I also did various tasks of investigation and photography. In my luggage, a lot of manuscripts and pictures have already accumulated. For this mysterious land of the shining sun, the value of these things is not small.</p>
<p>Arriving in Medan (2), I finished my work. I thought about going to the high mountain of Berastagi to take some scenic photos, and then going around from the central part of Sumatra to Dolok Silau to visit my old residence ten years ago, to see how my relatives have been, and to see how my childhood friends are now. At this time, the pre-economic panic in Nanyang had deepened, and it was completely different from the golden world when I lived here ten years ago. This, I have already clearly seen the declining scene in other places. Alas, Dolok Silau, this small commercial port, how have you been gripped by the iron palm of "recession"? My old friends and compatriots who are still struggling here, what kind of beating have you been subjected to by this ruthless tyrant?</p>
<p>With this feeling in mind, I arrived at my destination on the afternoon of the day after leaving Berastagi. Alas, where have the bustling vehicles of the past gone? Why are there so few pedestrians on the road? Passing by the restaurants, why can't I hear the noise of the overseas Chinese gathering to gamble and relax as before? When I got out of the long-distance bus and stepped under the black-lettered signboard of Qunyuhao opened by my relatives, a cold, gloomy air startled me. (At that time, the sun was still shining brightly, and the sunlight was still hot and scorching in the tropics.) Glancing into the store, there was only a clerk dozing off quietly, and two or three natives were sitting on the floor, muttering. Ah! How did the buyers and sellers who used to be overwhelmed with business become so quiet? In the past, it was completely different. At that time, the busy business was enough to make a clerk's waist ache and hands hurt, where would there be free time for you to sit down and rest? Let alone let you doze off?</p>

<p>As a rule, at the beginning of each week, the inflow and outflow of money in the silver and money industry are more crowded than usual, and the sorting procedures are also trivial. During this summer season, all industries are lazy as usual, and the collection and settlement situation is far less than the previous week. As for the market situation, it is not very energetic. The early and noon markets for foreign exchange still open at 8 points. The commission is not watered, and all are white commission. In the early market for exchange ticket transactions, more than 4.1 million were transferred, more than 300,000 were newly traded, and more than 200,000 were traded in the noon market. More than 400,000 were traded in the small general meeting. For foreign pledge transactions, more than 700,000 were redeemed, and more than 1.2 million were newly made. 1.67 million banknotes were collected and issued, with a customer source of 300,000 and an outflow of 400,000. For bank collections and settlements, foreign banks collected and settled more than 2.67 million ticket funds, 3.78 million for various goods, exchange pledges, miscellaneous funds, more than 800,000 for telegraphic transfer funds, and 500,000 for warehousing.

According to the report of the Clearing House on the 4th, the total number of exchanges was 7,953,303.22 silver dollars, including 4,095,166.24 silver dollars and 3,858,136.98 silver dollars for exchange transfers.</p>
<h3 id="e284">Returned Subsidiary Coins are Being Shipped One After Another <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the subsidiary coins from Guangdong, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hubei, and other provinces, which were previously shipped to Chasa for general use, have been gradually returning. Yesterday, the amount that arrived in Shanghai was more than 100,000 jiao, resulting in a drop in the market price. The early market was 740.07 yuan, and the noon market actually entered customs at 739.5 yuan. As a result, the two markets fell by a huge 3.2 yuan in total. In terms of transactions, 75,000 jiao were traded in the early market and 15,000 jiao were traded in the noon market. The price of Jiangnan subsidiary coins was the same in the early and noon markets at 835.5 yuan, which was 5.5 yuan better than the noon market the day before. However, the transaction was sparse. Only 5,000 jiao were traded in the early market, and even fewer, only 2,000 jiao, were traded in the noon market. Copper coins slightly increased by 500 wen, and 325,500 wen were traded, with a total value of 10,500 foreign yuan.</p>

<p>The foreign exchange situation in May was better than in the previous months, as reported in detail before. After a public meeting, it was resolved that the deposit interest rate was only slightly higher than 8 points. The difference was limited, so it was stipulated that it would still be 2.95 yuan after deduction, and the overdue interest would be added at a rate of 4.5 yuan per sitting plate, so the highest overdue interest price was still 10.05 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e286">Securities and Public Bonds Rise Consistently <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>Gold Short Sees a New High of $69.60</p>
<p>The market in the Chinese Securities Exchange was stable and trending firm yesterday. There were not many transactions. Major players entered and exited very little, and retail investors slightly covered their short positions. The situation was stable, and rumors also subsided. The future may rise first and then fall. The various gangs were particularly interested in financial short-term public bonds, so the market price was particularly high. Yesterday, a new high price was seen again. There were not a few people in the market who were looking at $72. Although it is not certain, the market price of $70 seems inevitable. If there is no change in the environment, it is a bullish opportunity, because there are too many people who are bearish. Although the rising trend yesterday was very gentle, it never showed any weakness. At the opening of the market in the morning, the ups and downs were slight, only about 1 jiao, but they were consistently slightly firm. A slight daze was seen in the second round due to arbitrage transactions. The market price was slightly different, only about 5 fen and 1 jiao. At the opening of the market in the afternoon, it was still consistently slightly better, but still only 5 fen and 1 jiao. The closing also continued to rise by 5 fen to 1.5 jiao. In summary, the result of the market price was that, except for the 18 Customs Bill, which had been separated for many days and was still down by 3 jiao, the rest were consistently trending firm by 5 fen, 1 jiao to 3.5 jiao. Gold Short saw a new high price of $69.60 again. The trend seems to have a slightly higher rise before it can return to looseness. Otherwise, it may still be difficult to escape the hovering situation. The total number of transactions was only 565,000 yuan. The results of its high, low, rise, and fall are listed in the comparison table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>The yarn market suddenly weakened, and the falling trend intensified. The rise the day before and the fall today are rapidly changing, making it truly frightening. This situation is entirely due to the too rapid rise, causing profit-takers to sell and close out. At the same time, there are also manufacturers selling short, so there was a sharp rise the day before, and a sudden fall today. However, the current yarn demand is still good, so the distant month saw a rebound at the close in the afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e288">Yarn Prices Fall by More Than Three Yuan Recently <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>The pre-market opening for standard yarn showed a weak market trend and prevalent selling pressure, caused by manufacturers selling short, leading to price drops of 2.3, 5, 7, and 8 jiao across different months. In the afternoon, short positions were closed, further weakening the market. Near-month contracts fell by 1.71 yuan, while far-month contracts remained flat. Total trading volume for the day was 200,670 dan. Sales included: Da Feng 4,300 dan, Ji Feng 2,200 dan, Tong Ji 2,900 dan, Chun Ji 6,900 dan, Ming De 3,800 dan, Chang Yu 1,500 dan, Shen Ji 8,100 dan, Da Chang 7,000 dan, Yuan Xing Chang 2,800 dan, De Ji 1,700 dan, Rui Yuan 1,500 dan, Chang Feng 9,400 dan, and Hui Kang 2,200 dan.

<p>Current yarn sales remain strong. Statistics show that various merchant groups purchased a total of 1,600 bales throughout the day. Market prices are similar to the previous day. The purchase amounts for each group are as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong 495, You Tou 13, Bei Wuhu 140, Hankou 30, Tianjin 370, Changsha 20, Inland 190, Ningbo 10, Jiangxi 50, Xiamen 25, Peers 10.</p>

<p>The cotton market also weakened, and the situation softened. The market relaxed due to falling prices and the closing of long positions. However, American cotton is trending higher due to drought, and Indian cotton is rising even more sharply. Therefore, buying interest in new cotton remains strong, and long position companies are quite firm in their intentions, absorbing dips and accumulating larger and larger positions.</p>

<p>The pre-market opening for standard cotton showed increasing buying interest due to the large increases in the American and Indian cotton markets, with far-month contracts rising. However, around the 23rd trade, the market suddenly reversed and fell, with prices dropping 0.5 to 0.4 jiao across different months. The afternoon was flat. Total trading volume for the day was 95,700 bales. Sales included: Da Ji 2,100 bales, Chun Ji 2,450 bales, Da Feng 3,500 bales, Ming De 1,050 bales, Zhen Da 950 bales, Hui Kang 2,450 bales, Tai Chang 2,150 bales, Da Chang 5,550 bales, De Ji 1,050 bales, and Sui Long 1,000 bales.

<p>Current cotton sales are still good. Sources include Yao cotton 100 bales, and Tong cotton 200 bales. Current cotton prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Tongzhou Cotton 45.25, Hengfeng Factory purchased 4,000 bales, spot delivery to factory.</p>
<p>Shashi Cotton 44.75, Dongmian Firm purchased 200 pieces, spot delivery from warehouse.</p>

<p>Although there was no progress in the labor situation last week, cotton prices remained strong. The reason for this is not an increase in buyers, but a shortage of deliveries. Therefore, even a few buyers can trigger a price increase. In the spot market, factory demand is better. China and Europe still show no buying interest, while Japan has improved slightly. Oomra and Gandhi cotton are being shipped to Japan. Shippers also have a small appetite for Broach cotton to offset previously sold short positions.

<h3 id="e294">Grain and Flour Futures Rise and Then Fall Sharply <a href="#e294" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c294" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">294</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw significant fluctuations after the morning opening. The Chicago and Canadian quotations for foreign wheat jumped by a substantial 1.12 yuan, so the opening price for the current month was stable, with little change from the previous week. This triggered enthusiastic buying from external speculators, pushing prices higher. For example, the September and October contracts rose by about 0.2 to 0.3 yuan compared to the previous week. However, this rise created a good opportunity for manufacturers to sell large quantities, causing prices to fall sharply in subsequent trading. In the afternoon, during the first two trades, long positions tried hard to compete, but their momentum waned. As buying interest decreased and factories sold off forward contracts, the market gradually declined. The rise was purely speculative, and the arrival of new wheat will bring many changes. As a result, the current month fell by 0.175 yuan, July fell by 0.075 yuan, August fell by 0.1 yuan, September fell by 0.15 yuan, and October and November each fell by 0.0325 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e295">Wheat Futures: High in the Morning, Low in the Afternoon <a href="#e295" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c295" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">295</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market saw rising prices after the morning opening. Although foreign wheat quotations fell slightly by 1.12 yuan, the poor harvests abroad seemed to have triggered speculation from outside investors. This situation was similar to the major floods in China in previous years. Therefore, buying interest was very strong in each trade, with prices rising by 0.3 to 0.6 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous week. However, in the afternoon, the market suddenly weakened, as flour futures did not rise but fell, seemingly shaking the foundation. Opening prices dropped by 0.3 to 0.5 yuan, and the market hovered as selling pressure eased. Given the abundant harvest of new wheat in China, it will be difficult to raise grain prices again in the short term. As a result, July fell by 0.02 yuan, August remained unchanged, September fell by 0.02 yuan, and October fell by 0.01 yuan. Spot wheat remained unchanged as factories did not move and there were no new transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e296">He Xia Rice Market Stagnant, Prices Continue to Fall <a href="#e296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were over 30 sources from various groups (a total of 4,500 to 4,600 shi). The market was initially active, but later became dull due to a lack of customers. The customer groups' appetite was even more relaxed, and the market color was drooping. By the close, only the Beiyang group had purchased over 1,000 bales of late rice. The prices of Qingjiao, Songjiang, and Sijing rice had all fallen by several fen. The general trend in the main street was that few people adopted them due to the approaching holidays, so the prices of Changbang, Sutong, and Nangang Japonica rice all fell sharply. Duyang and Jian rice followed suit, falling by several fen to nearly a jiao. Although Yinbian Yuan was timely, the market was inevitably somewhat relaxed due to the large number of arrivals, resulting in oversupply. The market color fell by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 23 to 24 boats arrived from various places in He Xia. The market for various goods remained stagnant, and prices continued to decline. The market shape was Japonica Yuan and Bo rice price fell by a little jiao, Yangbu Jian was reduced by a jiao, and Du was slightly short of several fen, while Ke Jian was flat.</p>
<h3 id="e297">Ke Xian Arrivals Are Limited, Sales Are Scarce <a href="#e297" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c297" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">297</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's Ke Xian market saw both limited arrivals and sales, and the market turned stable. Local buyers had already satisfied their appetite, and the Fuzhou group was not as eager to purchase as last month, so the market should be viewed with caution. However, recent sources have been particularly scarce. No whole trainload of Hunan Shashi or Jiangbei arrived in Shanghai. The forward goods have all arrived, with very few new arrivals. Furthermore, current production and inventory are low in the producing areas, and production prices are rising, making it difficult to offset the cost. Therefore, the market has been rejecting forward goods. Current buying interest is mainly focused on saving money. Yesterday, 1,181 bales were purchased. Local, Zhejiang, and Beiyang groups only made sporadic purchases, with a total of 675 bales purchased.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the first batch of 60 packages of new green broad beans from Minhang arrived. The goods were insufficient and only had about 80% of the quality, with a price of four yuan and three jiao, which was distributed to local retailers. The arrival of Wen Zhen white broad beans continued with a total of 245 packages, with varying dryness. Dry goods were one jiao higher than the first batch, with a price of three yuan and six jiao. Wet goods opened at the original price, all of which were purchased by foreign firms. The second and third batches of new rapeseed from Wenzhou arrived, totaling over 600 packages, but had not yet been opened for trading. 200 packages were opened for trading yesterday, with a price of four yuan, in accordance with tax-free regulations. The second and third batches of Nanjing goods also arrived, totaling 300 to 400 packages. Buyers who saw the samples thought the spicy seeds were too heavy, and they had to pay the first batch price of "four yuan" for customs clearance, so no agreement was reached. The first batch of new seeds from Wuhu had also arrived, totaling over 310 packages of good quality and color, with a quality above 95%. The asking price was four yuan and two jiao, but buyers did not agree to the price difference of two jiao, so no transaction was made.</p>
<h3 id="e299">Sugar Market: Picking Up, Qing Land Prices Soar <a href="#e299" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c299" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">299</a></h3>
<p>A large number of Hainan red sugars are traded in the black market. Yesterday, the sugar market was stable as the customs gold slightly increased. The guild's price for the second grade of coarse granulated white sugar was still 20 yuan, 6 jiao, and 7 fen, with no changes. The warehouse goods were selling well, but there were no transactions. Re-exported goods were 6 yuan, 7 jiao, and 5 fen, Hainan red sugar was 15 yuan and 9 jiao, Taikoo sugar B mark was 20 yuan and 8 jiao. The local factory's cotton white sugar was unchanged. With land prices getting tighter every day, the Chaoqing suppliers were holding on to their goods and refused to sell. According to yesterday's Shantou telegraph, the initial price for Tizhuang Qing was 12 yuan and 5 jiao, which was then raised to 12 yuan and 8 jiao. The price for shipping to Shanghai was close to 14 yuan, which was even more inverted. Some Zhengmian red sugar was opened for sale, with a price of 10 yuan and 5 jiao, which was about 0.5 yuan higher than before. Due to sluggish sales, Hainan red sugar has not been opened for a long time. However, since the price has reached a low point, it has attracted a lot of attention. In recent days, a huge amount of over 4,000 packages have been traded in the black market, and the price is a little lower, about 0.2 or 0.3 yuan. There is still a portion that is temporarily reluctant to continue trading. Xinghua red sugar was opened at 13 yuan and 4 jiao, Huizhou white sugar was opened with over 600 packages at 17 yuan and 8 jiao, and Jianbang opened with a few hundred boxes of standard Wufu white sugar at 18 yuan and 1 jiao per block, and several dozen boxes of high miscellaneous brands at 17 yuan and 7 jiao. Zhangdiao Qing has limited inventory, and the main demand is 12 yuan, which is temporarily not easy to reach.</p>

<p>Market Price Firm</p>
<p>Dried lily flowers from Guangdong moved again yesterday, with a total of over 100 packages sold at a price of 22 to 23 yuan. At a time when inventories are scarce, the transaction of over 100 packages is already a large number, so the market is quite impulsive. Supplier prices are also looking good, with rural suppliers opening at 22 yuan, and trader prices are even firmer.</p>
<h3 id="e301">Oil Market: Hong White Tung Oil Trending Higher <a href="#e301" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c301" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">301</a></h3>
<p>Hongjiang tung oil is in the peak season for summer sales, but sources have not been strong. The reason for this is that the output of various oil mills in the production area decreased last winter, especially Fuhong Qingyuanfeng. In the past, that brand was 0.2 yuan cheaper than Yang Hengyuan, but this summer it is actually 0.2 yuan higher, which shows that scarcity makes things valuable. The current market price is 24 yuan per barrel. Zhenghong Jichanghe has also increased to 27.8 yuan, and Jiyingfeng is 27 yuan. Sales have just started, and they have already shown their edge. If strong sales are encountered, I am afraid there will be even more prospects. White tung oil is steadily rising. Since a foreign company in Hankou sold it at 30 yuan and 4 jiao, fortunately, the subsequent delivery was not strong, and it can be temporarily fixed. If there is a follow-up purchase, it must be added again. Foreign companies in Shanghai also make a small number of purchases, but foreign trade is handled by one or two bean and rice firms, and there are only two or three tung oil firms doing foreign business, and the scope is not as large as bean and rice firms. Therefore, when there is a transaction, only a few dozen tons can be sold, so the inflow and outflow are not large. Recently, it was heard that a certain bean and rice firm had settled a large number and was searching for and handling it in Hangzhou for several days, which stimulated the market. Generally, the price for shipping from Hangzhou to Shanghai must be 37 yuan per block. With such strong foreign demand, it can be said that the market will always have more glory than disgrace.</p>
<h3 id="e302">Hardware: French Tinplate Disrupts the Market <a href="#e302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>
<p>Recently, there have been many new arrivals of French tinplate, so a large number of them are stored in various foreign warehouses in Pudong and Puxi. As a result, many peers in the market hold this commodity. There are many people selling them on the market. Moreover, the cost is cheap, so the prices of British, American, and German tinplate are mostly dragged down and trending looser. The current market prices are listed below for investigation (unit: yuan):</p>
<p>Category         American      British       German        French</p>
<p>90 lbs           16.25        14.00        14.90        14.60</p>
<p>100 lbs          17.50        16.00        15.90        15.50</p>
<p>180 lbs          32.00        30.00        29.80        29.00</p>
<p>200 lbs          34.50        32.00        31.50        31.00</p>
<p>From the above prices, American goods are the most expensive, British and German goods are cheaper, and French goods are the cheapest. Therefore, many customer groups and factories want to purchase them, so the Shanghai market has been the most active in terms of sales since it was occupied. But American goods are uniquely unaffected, because the quality is relatively good.</p>
<h3 id="e303">Piece Goods: Various Fabric Stores Restricting Credit <a href="#e303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>The fabric market was quiet yesterday, and transactions were cleared. Most of the transactions were scattered and rarely whole boxes. Even fewer were shipped for export. Even mail parcels have decreased. Because this year's fabric market is worse than in previous years, the guest groups in various ports have reduced their appetites. The biggest reason is that the domestic ports are short of funds and business is difficult. In addition, now that the Dragon Boat Festival is not far away, the companies in the fabric industry are planning to collect debts, and on the one hand, they are cautiously restricting credit. Therefore, if there are transactions, they all require bills, and the business is gradually decreasing.</p>

<p>(Hangzhou Silk Cocoon Brokers Suppressing Prices) Cocoon brokers in Lin'an and other places in Hangzhou have been weighing and collecting cocoons for more than ten days. New cocoons in the four villages have a good harvest, and the market arrival is quite strong. The price of cocoons is not high. At the beginning, the price of improved varieties of high-quality cocoons was 30 yuan per Sima catty, and the price of local varieties was 20 yuan. Recently, silk cocoon merchants have continued to decline in the spot price of silk in Europe and the United States, so they are suppressing prices and collecting cocoons. In the past two days, improved cocoons were only 20 to 25 yuan, and local cocoons were 14 to 18.9 yuan, and farmers suffered losses. (Shaoxing Fresh Cocoons Arrive in Large Quantities) Shaoxing's four villages mostly produce early silkworms, and the harvest is the richest in the late improved varieties of cocoons. The new cocoons have been on the market for more than ten days, and more than ten cocoon shops have opened. The price of cocoons is restricted by public discussion and cannot be allowed to fluctuate. The price of improved varieties is 25 yuan per Sima catty, and the price of local cocoons is 18.5 yuan. The market price is only 20 yuan to 14 yuan, and all silkworm farmers are losing money.</p>
<p>(Nanjing Fresh Cocoons Open at a Low Price) The improved varieties bred in various cities and villages in Nanjing are of excellent quality due to effective guidance, and the cocoon production is quite abundant. However, there are few cocoon shops that have opened, and the price of cocoons is not high. The highest price for improved varieties of high-quality cocoons is only 24.5 yuan, and the price of local varieties is 18.5 yuan, and silkworm farmers cannot afford to make losses.</p>
<p>(Shiying Silkworm Farmers are Selling at a Loss) Farmers in Shiying are breeding silkworms under the guidance of the farm, so they are all leading incubation and breeding. However, the weather is not right, and most of the local silkworms are lost. The improved silkworms incubate quite a bit, eat more leaves, and the cocoon harvest is about 70 to 80% of the year, but the cost is not cheap. The newly opened price of cocoon shops is only 14 yuan (local cocoons) to 20 yuan (improved cocoons).</p>
<p>(Lyon Chinese Silk Prices Report Another Drop) Lyon silk weaving factories are experiencing sluggish sales of silk products, and the use of raw silk has greatly decreased. Japanese merchants are selling new silk at low prices, resulting in another drop in Chinese silk prices. The prices of white factory Jing San Tiaowu brand and other grades are only 58.5 francs per kilo, down 0.5 francs. The prices of Sichuan and Lu yellow factories are over 60 francs, down 1 franc each. Converted to Chinese currency, each package is down 4.5 yuan to 8.9 yuan.</p>

<p>The European and American markets are still experiencing sluggish sales of raw silk, and Japanese silk merchants are relentlessly selling new silk. No one is asking about Chinese silk. The cables sent from Shanghai yesterday were not forwarded. All the European and American companies are still, and the domestic traders are also watching and waiting. The market is even more sluggish. There are no reports of current silk transactions, and the future is becoming increasingly bleak.</p>

<p>Yesterday's foreign tea market in Shanghai saw a decline in the prices of high and medium-grade black tea from Qimen and Fuliang. The secondary and tertiary goods had already shrunk to 78 yuan, which was 10 to 20 yuan lower than before. Currently, the British companies and foreign firms in the market are mostly taking a wait-and-see attitude, and the market is still afraid that it will be difficult to stabilize. The trading houses such as Xie He and Yihong have become more interested in the Zhenmei and Sicha tea from Luzhuang and Tuzhuang. Su'an Zhenmei has risen by 3 to 4 yuan compared to last week, and the rest are also stable.</p>

<h3 id="e307">Talking about the Sexual Anxiety of Modern Youth <a href="#e307" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c307" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">307</a></h3>
<p>— Peng He</p>
<p>When people reach adolescence, they encounter the problem of sexual anxiety. This sexual anxiety is a major hurdle of adolescence. Of course, sexual needs are not limited to adolescence, but they are most intense during this period. Moreover, sexual anxiety is most dangerous during adolescence. Therefore, many young people often ruin, waste, or even fall because of sexual anxieties. This shows how severely the problem of sexual anxieties is hitting modern youth. Especially in this excessively prosperous city, the atmosphere of the end of the century is full of decadence and wild pleasures. The surrounding negative environment constantly and violently stimulates the minds of every young person, causing everyone to walk down the road to ruin. Sensual movies, legs, cheongsams, alluring prostitutes standing on the side of the road, and extremely sensual dances in movie theaters are all materials that make everyone indulge in decadent and decadent pleasures. Adolescents who are experiencing intense sexual impulses, under this extremely adverse environment, who can resist the temptation and avoid falling? Therefore, in this city, the extent of youthful decadence is particularly serious.</p>
<p>The increasing decadence of young people is particularly regrettable and frightening. Of course, there are many ambitious young people who are willing to bury themselves in hard work, the more adverse the environment is; however, on the other hand, there are also countless weak-willed young people who are buried by the adverse environment, which is a great loss to society.</p>
<p>Why do young people fall into decadence like this? This is because the current society is fundamentally unsuitable for cultivating young people. Of course, on the one hand, it can be said that the more adverse the environment is, the more it can hone heroic and promising young people; however, most young people are ultimately unable to progress due to the particularly bad environment. For example, the countryside is bankrupt, and education is bankrupt, which makes it impossible for young people to study. Consequently, the city is also in decline, which makes it impossible for young people to get jobs. These are all fundamental reasons that make it impossible for young people to progress. In particular, the problem of sexuality is because the current society is in the process of alternating between the old and the new. The old women cannot satisfy them, and the new women have not been produced (even if there are, they are extremely few), and the uneven development of society is due to the remaining strong influence of the old social forces, which makes it impossible for young people to have normal social interactions between men and women. In this way, sexual anxiety can only drive young people to the road of decadence. The sexual anxiety of young people should have a proper release at a certain time, and love is also necessary during adolescence, but the current young people cannot get these, so of course they can only fall. The decadence of modern young people is really made by society, this is a very clear fact.</p>
<p>However, let us not forget that history is created by human beings. The irrationality of society requires us to transform it. Who should bear the responsibility for this transformation? Of course, none other than us young people. Because young people (especially poor young people) are generally more revolutionary. Revolutionary youth are the pioneers of the times. Now, we young people have to shoulder the responsibility of transforming society and advancing history. Young people in front of the times, do not hesitate any more, decadence and enjoyment will only bury your life, now we can only bury our heads and work hard. Only burying our heads and working hard is our true way out today. Naturally, the goal of this hard work should undoubtedly be the general public. Sexual anxiety cannot bury your life, and at the same time, the adverse environment can never be used as an excuse for you to shirk your responsibility. Only the cowardly will say that your decadence is caused by the compulsion of the environment.</p>
<h3 id="e308">After Seeing the Performance of the YC Dramatic Society <a href="#e308" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c308" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">308</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Ping</p>
<p>Carrying the early summer evening breeze, I walked into the campus of St. John's University, the old site where the anti-imperialist flames ignited during the May 30th Movement. It has now passed like a dream. Guided by Mr. X, I entered the resplendent and luxurious common room. The play *Father Returns* had already begun on the stage.</p>
<p>It seems unnecessary to explain the story of *Father Returns* here, as it is such a familiar drama. I have seen performances of *Father Returns* four or five times, but it was my first time seeing it performed with Japanese costumes. However, it seems that one need not be so overly faithful to that setting. Not only was the kimono unfamiliar and unsuited to the audience, but it also detracted from the plot. Zong Tai's neat Western suit replaced the tattered cotton robe, and because of his upright posture, Zong Tai looked much younger, which made the final collapse seem abrupt. Zhen Niang not sitting in a chair sewing but standing in the center of the stage talking to Xian Yilang seemed unnatural. After Zong Tai came in, he wasn't offered a seat, and he stood in the center of the stage, puffing out his chest as if he were about to give a speech. The overly luxurious scenery did not help the plot, which was already damaged by the costumes and other elements.</p>
<p>However, the biggest mistake was adding the ending that everyone had cut out. It not only made Xian Yilang's personality contradictory due to "innate nature" (a shortcoming that Liang believed was present in Kikuchi Kan's work), but also diluted the power of the tragedy. Originally, the tragic effect of ending the play with Zhen Niang, Xin Erlang, and younger sister crying out for Xian Yilang and their brother after Zong Tai left the house was very powerful. However, adding the ending here reduced the effect of the play. Of course, the responsibility for this must also be attributed to the slave education system that keeps students locked in prison and out of touch with the outside world. It never allows students to look beyond the prison to see what kind of world exists. The ridiculously feudal view of absolutely prohibiting female students from performing further illustrates the unreasonableness of the slave education system.</p>
<p>The second play, *The Will to Live*, was generally better than *Father Returns*. Although there were still many shortcomings, such as forgetting to hang the mother's portrait, the child's crying being too low, and the servant being portrayed with vulgar humor, several actors performed very well. In particular, Lan Yeshen's firm and somber delivery of the line, "Because my will to live is too strong," struck everyone's hearts. This scene was relatively satisfying, and of course, the fact that the script itself was easier to produce an effect was also a reason for this scene's success.</p>
<p>The third play, "Mei Liang," was far superior to the previous two in terms of actors, scenery, and story. Lan Yeshen's A Qiao, Qin Fuji's A Mao, Wang Baoyuan's moneylender, Feng Jizhong's detective, and Wang Jinsheng's Boss Pan all achieved success due to the suitability of their personalities to their roles. Although there were still flaws, such as A Mao not having his hands bound and the improper placement of Boss Pan's bed, these minor flaws did not detract from the overall success of the play.</p>
<p>However, just as they added the ending to *Father Returns*, which everyone had cut out, they made a big mistake by omitting the ending to *Mei Liang*, which everyone performed. After Boss Pan committed suicide (here he merely fell down), A Qiao and his old wife returned, crying and shouting, "Father, why did you commit suicide? Mr. Zhang has already shown us a way out. Don't you see that our bright future is coming soon?" This would have further enhanced the power of *Mei Liang*, but it was not included here.</p>
<p>I also saw the first performance of the YC Dramatic Society, but the progress from the first to the second performance is amazing. On the one hand, it was due to the increased experience of the actors. At the same time, the enrichment of the content of the script added a lot of success. Of course, it also had many mistakes, but I believe that the members of the YC Dramatic Society have great hope, as long as they keep pace with the trends in the theatrical world outside the prison, experience society more, engage with society more, and are willing to learn and work hard, under a sound guide rather than under the shackles of a slave education system that creates foreign slaves and its appendages.</p>
<h3 id="e309">Returning Home at Night <a href="#e309" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c309" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">309</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Jia</p>
<p>I seem too cruel, don't I? The small grass by the roadside is already sweetly asleep. The paved stones are already不堪[unbearable] for the trampling of cattle and sheep. Taking advantage of the hanging of the black curtain of night, they are stretching out their limbs, letting fatigue no longer linger. Yes, then I should lighten my footsteps a little.</p>
<p>Lightly, I walk, alcohol reddening my face. Before my eyes, drifting, drifting, are thousands of black eyeballs, beautiful black eyeballs belonging to a certain woman. In my ears, ringing, ringing, is the laughter with the scent of *Lindera obtusiloba*, also belonging to a certain beautiful woman.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>These, at tonight's banquet of friends, I have already become familiar with. But now, I am cleaving through the night mist to return. And the black eyeballs, and the laughter with the scent of *Lindera obtusiloba*, bite at my clothes, following, following me, where to?</p>
<p>In the lonely night mist, everything is a little blurred. They don't let you bump into them, but they often make you bump into them. In the drunkenness of alcohol, in the intoxication of black eyeballs and the laughter with the scent of *Lindera obtusiloba*, I grope, I want to find a road, a road I can take to return home.</p>
<p>The road at night should be a place that makes people think of imaginable things. For example, beside the new tomb at the foot of the mountain, there are a few phosphorescent lights flashing. But when I tiptoe forward, there is a beautiful woman there. This woman may even be the unparalleled beauty described by ancient poets. At that time, she will generously throw out captivating glances, and awareness-capturing smiles, and even the language of golden silk nightingales singing. What should I do then? Then I should step forward, embrace, embrace tightly. I close my eyes in intoxication, kiss madly, kiss madly. But suddenly I smell a fishy smell. I open my eyes, and a red-faced, green-faced ghost with a long tongue is being held tightly by me. She laughs, laughs like a collapsing city wall. What can I do?</p>
<p>The road at night is full of fantasy. I know that this kind of encounter is impossible. I know that it is possible to scare the胆[gall], but I am willing to have this one encounter, even if I am dragged into the desolate tomb by the ghost.</p>
<p>But the night is beautiful, tranquil, and not snobbish. It can make a person entangled in mundane affairs forget on the road at night, and it can make you produce all kinds of night road fantasies. He whom you cannot meet in the daytime, whom you cannot dream of in dreams, the night can make you think of on the road at night. In an instant, the night can satisfy you.</p>
<p>The owl's laughter cannot be seen in the daytime, but at night, you can hear it without difficulty, hear the singing of this king of the night.</p>
<p>Returning home at night allows people to appreciate what they have never appreciated on weekdays. Now I have fully and satisfyingly drawn from it, but what spoils my mood is that the lights of my home are already flickering before my eyes.</p>

<p>— Wen Yuan</p>
<p>A corner of Robison Road in western Shanghai fully exposes another side of urban life in the oriental Paris of the universe. This is something that the aristocratic bourgeoisie cannot imagine, and even the poet Gui Kou cannot understand. Fortunately, otherwise, they would say it was extraordinarily good, lest they patronize this popular labor theater.</p>
<p>From the beginning to the end of Robison Road, factories are arranged like stars on a chessboard, maintaining the survival of slave-like laborers? In fact, it is pressing laborers into slaves. Every day at five o'clock in the morning and five o'clock in the afternoon is the busiest time on Robison Road, and all activities begin. This is the roar of thousands of workers, and even more the tragic cry of thousands of workers. Through this mourning and tragic cry, groups of laborers begin. Here are: open-air stages with unnamed characters, including Peking Opera, folk songs. Civilization dramas (new theater companies) perform magic tricks (magic category). This is the artistic appreciation of the laborers, this is the comprehensive art of the masses. The performance of two or three people can attract hundreds of spectators, but unfortunately these are all low-grade tastes, close to vulgarity!</p>
<p>On both sides of the road and at the entrances of the alleys, there are standing open-air gambling stalls, or squatting on the ground, suddenly forming a pile. This is the momentary comfort after twelve hours of imprisonment. They are crowded there, not even easily exhaling a breath, staking what remains in their pockets on a single throw, hoping for victory. The result is that blood and sweat are effortlessly taken from their pockets into someone else's pocket, another layer of exploitation. A cry of "The old man is out!" and they all run away empty-handed.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a burst of "Kill a thousand knives! Cold coffin!" The playful and abusive teasing sounds are the echoes of male workers teasing female workers. Presumably, it is to solve the problem of sex and attack his opponent? Naturally, this is long-term hunger and thirst, not to be considered love, but they do not have the material conditions, unlike the love of modern girls, which is built on material things. Comparing those who ride in rickshaws with those who ride in cars: the former are hardworking, good at operating, and accustomed to enjoying. Young people|Aren't you looking for a suitable match|Why must you look in the city? After all, can you be satisfied with those wave-like gold-worshiping girls? Then why disregard good wives and virtuous mothers|Is it because of the disparity in the killings of the classes, the remaining poison of traditional concepts not yet eliminated?</p>

<p>— Yin Xiang</p>
<p>"Snap!" The electric light went out quickly.</p>
<p>"Buzz buzz buzz" The mosquitoes began to attack me. I had no mosquito net as a defense, only a thin quilt as a fortress.</p>
<p>"Non-resistanceism!" I sang, really for my own benefit, wanting to sleep peacefully and ignore them, but it wouldn't work. They wanted you to sleep, so they could steal your fresh blood.</p>
<p>"Slap!" I slapped the itchy spot, hitting air, and feeling a large lump of flesh the size of a fingertip, protruding from the skin. Scratch, scratching was still itchy.</p>
<p>"Buzz buzz buzz..." They sang a song of victory in my ears. I reached out in a daze to take off my felt cap as a weapon, and blindly groped in the darkness. The only purpose was to drive them away.</p>
<p>One of their spears pierced my cheek again.</p>
<p>"Slap!" With a casual rub, it was a little wet. One of them had sacrificed, crushed into a mud paste.</p>
<p>"Buzz buzz buzz" Not only did they not retreat, but they sang their military song even louder. I thought, "Maybe they have launched a general offensive... No, not an offensive, just a sneak attack." The wind outside the window howled in the dark world, as if cheering them on.</p>
<p>"Oh... Terrible... night!" I was furious, but without defensive weapons, and in the pitch-black night, I couldn't resist. The only thing I could do was grab a few of their minions to vent my anger.</p>
<p>Pulling up the quilt, I went to sleep, but after a while, my head, hands, and legs slipped out. Their killing sound, "Buzz buzz buzz..." spread everywhere, stealing opportunities, sucking my blood, to enlarge their own bellies. "Slap, slap," I didn't have many hands, taking care of the east but not the west, at most grabbing two, but on my skin, they had built many tomb-like lumps of flesh. The wind blew away the black curtain, and the fish-belly white faintly rose outside the window. I could vaguely see the mosquitoes busily working around my bed, "Buzz buzz..." I dragged out my only weapon again—the felt cap—and hit them hatefully. Blindly groping, wanting to destroy them.</p>
<p>"I should fight, resist," I thought. They were, after all, just petty thieves, not daring to come out openly. At the arrival of dawn, they scattered and hid.</p>

<p>— Li Ying</p>
<p>Forward, friends! Walk to the end, walk out of this world!</p>
<p>Are you probably thirsty from walking? Do you all eagerly hope to get a drink of water? But there is not a trickle of spring here. Are you probably hungry from walking? Do you all eagerly seek something to eat? But there are no delicious fruits here. This is a world of wind and sand.</p>
<p>But you must always advance, enduring hunger, enduring cold. The wind here howls like a wild beast all day and night, endlessly blowing on you, blowing you up and knocking you down. The sand here covers the sky and the earth like thousands of fists dancing wildly, hitting your head and face, knocking you down and getting up again. This is Satan's world.</p>
<p>But you must always advance, bearing hardship, accepting danger.</p>
<p>Because once you turn back, there will be greater hardships to torment you, deeper dangers to terrorize you. Then, Satan will be completely victorious. He will hide in the dark, watching you, this unfortunate group, with widened eyes and cracked mouths, revealing a triumphant, hideous smile.</p>
<p>Friends, do not hesitate any longer, walk! Throw open your lion-like strides.</p>
<p>Please rub your eyes that are blurred by the wind and sand, and look up at the dragon; at the end, the sun is shining with brilliant light, welcoming you!</p>
<p>But do not forget the trap before your eyes.</p>
<p>Friends! Now is not the time for you to rest. Stand up and walk! May God bless you!</p>
<h3 id="e313">A Thousand Words <a href="#e313" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c313" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">313</a></h3>
<p>— Passerby</p>
<p>After reading *Tan Yan*, three huge words are deeply imprinted in my mind—"A Thousand Words." I think about it in the garret, and I think about it on the road. I'm simply obsessed with it. However, it's not love, just three words: "A Thousand Words."</p>
<p>A thousand words, surely I still have them in my stomach, right? As long as I arrange them appropriately, I can go and collect the manuscript fee. All that is required is quality; there are no other requirements. I think, I think, and I can't help but feel happy. Not much is needed, just a thousand words, and the hungry worms in my stomach will no longer cry.</p>
<p>Good, no need to fantasize, hurry up and put the words together. Don't run wild, don't go in circles, just a thousand words and it's done! But, heavens! Although the pen is in my hand, there is not a single word on the page, and my literary inspiration has also taken a leave of absence, no longer in the garret.</p>
<p>Watching the bright white silver dollars and the red and green banknotes being taken away by others, while I, myself, am always scratching my head... what!</p>
<p>Just a thousand words is so difficult. What kind of minds do those who can write ten thousand words at a stroke have? Perhaps they are men of letters, while I am a literary beggar? Since a thousand words is not easy, why do the editors still set a limit? I suppose the world is full of those who write ten thousand words but stray ten thousand miles from the topic, and only I am an exception, so they set this limit, right?</p>
<p>Or perhaps it is precisely because of the limit that I cannot write; if there were no limit, perhaps it would be very easy to write thousands upon thousands of words. Putting down the pen, I can't help but think this way. For the sake of my stomach, for the sake of the manuscript fee, and even more because I cannot write, although I do not dare to cause trouble in the rear, I cannot help but feel a little resentment crawling out of my heart.</p>
<p>In fact, this is my fault. In society, when and where do we not encounter restrictions? Can we do as we please? Are those things that are inconvenient for us not a hundred times more serious than the restriction of a thousand words? Do we not obediently comply with them, daring not to resist or resent them in the slightest? Why fixate on "A Thousand Words" alone!</p>
<p>Moreover, in reality, there is limited space, and there are many who beg for food, how can we let Grandma Wang release her... now the spectators in the world no longer have such a bad habit.</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>They like to eat an economical meal, wanting it to be concise and short.</p>
<p>As for whether an article can be written or not, it has nothing to do with restrictions. Just as someone who knows how to box can still show all their skills even when wearing shackles, someone who does not know how to box cannot produce a single posture or gesture even when their hands and feet are free. It can be seen that whether there is a limit or not is irrelevant.</p>
<p>Thinking this way, I know that I cannot blame others; I can only blame myself for being too stupid to even put together an article of a thousand words, and for letting the hungry worms in my stomach grumble in vain.</p>
<p>For a long time, I stared blankly at the pen, still facing a blank sheet of paper. Only at the beginning of the manuscript paper were there three words written in bold: "A Thousand Words."</p>
<h3 id="e314">Loquat <a href="#e314" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c314" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">314</a></h3>
<p>— Fei</p>
<p>The wheels of time are turning forward incessantly, turning. Gusts of gentle breeze have brought the warmth of early summer. Time has mercilessly driven away people's youth. From spring to summer, from summer to winter, the time of a year has passed in just an instant. The short spring light has finally disappeared unnoticed by people!</p>
<p>Another year has passed easily, and it's summer again. The sound of "Crisp and refreshing candied plums..." from the hawkers' mouths has been replaced by the cries of "Mountain loquats." Now that cherry blossoms and plums are out of season, the white sand loquats are following up. Villagers send the loquats into the city by boatload after boatload, and then the hawkers transfer them to the mouths of the eaters, tasting the sour and sweet flavors. Indeed, the people in the city have good fortune with food after all, always eating the latest seasonal goods.</p>
<p>"Silkworms get old and loquats turn yellow!" This saying is most popular in our countryside; I am afraid that even three-year-old children understand it. At present, most of the spring silkworms have already gone to the cocoon frames, so on the loquat mountains, a green shade hangs heavy, revealing the yellow, round, adorable loquats in abundance. There are often three or five children guarding the mountains, unlike the usual quiet, so quiet that even ghosts can be caught.</p>
<p>The loquats are yellow on the mountain, and the cocoons are white on the frame. "This is a beautiful hope that everyone in the village imagines," "Golden footrests in April." Because the great hope of the countryside for the year depends entirely on this one season. Whether yellow or white, they can all be turned into colorful banknotes and snow-white, shiny silver dollars.</p>
<p>My hometown—Dongting Mountain—is originally very famous for its white sand loquats, but unfortunately, most people in Shanghai are not fortunate enough to taste them. Because the so-called mountain loquats they eat are entirely from Tangqi. Tangqi loquats ripen early and look good, and the price is also cheaper, but they taste sour, astringent, and bland. The mountain loquats are not like that. Their ripening period is at least one to two weeks after the Dragon Boat Festival. However, their appearance is not as good as the Tangqi goods, and the price is also more expensive, but the difference is clear once they are tasted. Because they are as sweet as honey and the juice is viscous. But there are also good and bad ones. There are many varieties, the best of the white sand is the green type, followed by the purple type, and then the chuan nao type. In addition to these, there is also a red-haired white sand and a green sweet type, which taste no less than the green type. But people do not recognize the red-haired white sand as white sand, because its style is no different from the red sand. The green sweet type is always green, without any yellow color, so whoever sees it will not want to eat it. There are also many types of red sand, such as early red and falling red.</p>
<p>When I was young, as soon as I saw the loquats on the trees turn a light yellow, a small heart would feel happy. Because, at this time, the silkworm work has ended, and I don't need to go to school, so I spend the whole day on the mountain with a few children, jumping and playing. My mother or sister sends the three meals of the day to the mountain for us to eat. In the evening, I stay on the mountain with my grandmother. Sometimes, I strain my sharp little throat and sing: "Up the mountain, down the mountain, who is stealing loquats? The blind man saw it, the deaf man heard it, the mute told it, the lame man chased it; the wild pheasant on the mountainside, beat the crow, the crow cries wah wah!" After shouting until my mouth is dry, I climb the tree to pick the big, ripe loquats and eat them. I take the peeled skin and the pit and throw them into the tea bushes in one go, because my mother will scold and beat me if she sees it.</p>
<p>Now, whenever I see loquats, I think of my childhood, and at the same time, it also evokes my beautiful, broken dreams!</p>
<p>I rushed into the city in the year I was seventeen, and this year is almost ten years. However, after experiencing several vicissitudes, I am still my old self! Every year, when the loquat season comes, I always feel sad when I see loquats! The scenery of the old place is no longer what it used to be, and my footprints have not been on the loquat mountain for ten years. A flick of the jade leg, ten million in gold!</p>
<p>In the deformed social contradictions of a city, running thousands of miles earns nine copper coins!</p>
<h3 id="e315">The Wet Nurse's Sorrow <a href="#e315" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c315" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">315</a></h3>
<p>— Guangyu</p>
<p>It was early summer evening, exactly eight o'clock. In the bedroom of a certain bourgeois family, the violet electric lamp emitted an extremely gentle and clear glow, the colors were the most harmonious.</p>
<p>The owners of the bedroom were a young couple. At that moment, the husband was there, amusing himself by playing a phonograph, and the wife was leaning on the sofa, quietly listening to the lyrics coming from the phonograph. In her hand, she was also holding a collection of modern songs, and her gaze was focused on that song collection.</p>
<p>In the center of the bedroom stood a rocking bed, and sleeping inside was a child about a year old. Needless to say, the child was the crystallization of love of this young couple who owned the bedroom.</p>
<p>There was also a wet nurse. Although she was also young, looking at her haggard face, one would immediately understand that she was an ill-fated woman who had long experienced the sorrows of the world.</p>
<p>At this time, the young master in the rocking bed, having finished sucking his fill of milk, bought with money and forcefully taken from another child, was already fast asleep. Therefore, the wet nurse was ordered by her mistress, under the condition that she shouldn't be idle after eating her fill, to beat her own back and massage the mistress's fair legs.</p>
<p>"The record of the Wet Nurse's Song is really nice to listen to! Darling, put it on and sing it once for me to hear! I can sing along with it!" When the phonograph lyrics finished one song, the mistress turned her face and gave a charming glance to her husband standing beside the machine.</p>
<p>"Really you can sing the Wet Nurse's Song? That's really great."</p>
<p>"Who's fooling you!" the mistress replied, "... well, maybe I don't sing it so well!"</p>
<p>So, the husband began to find the record, and the wife also flipped through the song collection she was holding, page after page, looking for the so-called Wet Nurse's Song lyrics.</p>
<p>| Autumn rain... drips on the phoenix tree... autumn flowers are fully red... |</p>
<p>In this way, the lyrics were finally transmitted from the phonograph, and the wife accompanied them, and the husband raised his left arm to beat time for her.</p>
<p>| Love and... hate... are... heavy... heavy; ... kindness and... hatred... are various... various... |</p>
<p>| The tenth... month of pregnancy the mother's... heart... aches... waaa... a sound... a heroic cry of the child... |</p>
<p>"Darling, your singing voice is extremely beautiful, even more outstanding than the one on the record!" the husband complimented her in this way, but the wife did not make a sound, and kept singing her song.</p>
<p>| Money ah!... breaks apart people... mother and child cannot meet. Class ah!... you send my precious child... away... to the... end... |</p>
<p>| I want... to see... the child's smiling... face, ... I want... to see their sleeping... face. ... |</p>
<p>"Isn't that right? Darling, the child's sleeping face is indeed too adorable!" the husband said, wearing a playful smile and pointing at his own child sleeping in the rocking bed.</p>
<p>The mistress did not stop her singing at all. ... | I want to see my precious child, ... unless in a dream. ... At that time, Zhang the wet nurse, was already hurt deeply in her heart by the phonograph and her mistress's lyrics, and was secretly shedding tears.</p>
<p>"Zhang nanny, why are you crying for no reason?" The husband discovered that Zhang nanny was weeping, and was quite displeased in his heart, so he said sternly.</p>
<p>The mistress also immediately stopped singing, and a layer of sorrow immediately hung on her pink face. Bursting out with rage, she said, "We're so happy, and you just have to come and ruin our luck?"</p>
<p>The mistress's commotion woke the young master in the rocking bed. Zhang nanny hurriedly jumped over and picked him up, holding him in her arms. She put the nipple into his small mouth, and put on a smiling face, acknowledging her mistake to her two young masters, saying, "Good young master, good mistress, I'm not crying! Just now, a strand of silk floated and went into my eye socket, and I couldn't open my eyes for a moment, and tears flowed out. Good young master, good mistress, think, you treat me so well, what else am I dissatisfied with!"</p>
<p>The wise masters, after Zhang nanny's softening explanation, had forgiven her. But from then on, the pitiful Zhang nanny even lost the only remaining right to weep secretly to herself.</p>

<h3 id="e316">Hoping to Reconcile and Return to Good Terms <a href="#e316" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c316" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">316</a></h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>It is embarrassing to say, I am now encountering a marriage problem that I cannot solve. I have long paid attention to your newspaper's mailbox, which is a bright light for society and a guide for youth. I sincerely ask you with utmost sincerity to give me a clear path, and I am waiting with wide eyes, waiting and waiting.</p>
<p>Four or five years ago, my family arranged for me to be engaged to a woman I had never met, which I naturally did not want. Therefore, after meeting a Miss H two years ago, friendship developed into love. Over the course of a year, our passion almost reached the boiling point. At that time, the degree of closeness was truly intimate, with the idea of preferring to be mandarin ducks rather than envying immortals. At the same time, I also noticed that Miss H truly had no insincerity towards me. Who knew that this year, Miss H suddenly became distant from me for some reason and instead became romantically involved with another young man. May I ask, should I continue to pursue Miss H, express my true feelings, and hope to reconcile and return to good terms? Or should I succumb to the old ethics and marry a woman with whom there is no love to speak of? However, Miss H is indeed a rare and exceptional woman. Sir, I implore you to help me resolve this, using it as a compass. With this, I respectfully wish you</p>
<p>Peace　　　　　　　　　Humble person Jiang Sijing respectfully informs you</p>
<p>Answer: She used to love you, but now she is "romantically involved with another young man." That clearly shows that she finds that young man more lovable than you, so she is "distant" from you and close to others. This is not because she has any misunderstanding about you. You want to express your true feelings to her. May I ask, what true feelings do you want to express? Expressing that you sincerely love her may not be able to move her, because she doesn't feel that you don't love her and love someone else instead.</p>
<p>What you should do now is not to "express your true feelings" yourself, but to ask her to "express her true feelings." If she is firm and honestly tells you that she no longer loves you, then you should give up completely. If she says that she has not fallen in love with someone else, then of course it would be best, and you can immediately "reconcile and return to good terms." What is most annoying is if she loves you and also loves someone else. If there is such an indication, you must be cautious. In my opinion, a love triangle is dangerous. If she has such a thought, you must not be sentimental, lest both sides are hurt.</p>
<p>Breaking up with her does not necessarily mean "succumbing to the old ethics." These are completely two different matters. If you are unwilling to marry a "woman with whom there is no love to speak of," you can also not marry after breaking up. I feel that you also have improprieties in this relationship with Miss H. Since you were engaged, how could you become romantically involved with someone else? Even if you are dissatisfied with the engagement, you should maintain chastity during the period the engagement is still valid. Fortunately, you now have a rift with her, otherwise, you would be passionately intimate, but you couldn't get rid of the "country girl." That would be very troublesome. So perhaps her falling in love with someone else is also motivated by the fact that you have not dissolved the original engagement.　　　　　　　　Editor</p>

<p>— Maifu</p>
<p>The candlelight flickered like fireflies, in the silent night, he was silent. His appearance was like this... head down, drooping, just like Johnson deeply repenting at his dead father's ancient book stall. Sorrow, grief, lamentation... like a rope tightly entangling his lonely and wounded heart. His will was shaking like the candlelight before him.</p>
<p>| Should I go back? I've been wandering outside for five whole years, am I going back empty-handed? No, absolutely not! But, what will happen to her frail and helpless heart?... |</p>
<p>Finally, he raised his head, tears falling like beads, and his faint gaze moved to a letter from his homeland, written with blood and tears.</p>
<p>Ping'er:</p>
<p>...Five years since we parted, I have been longing for you every day. In my dreams, I wake up crying. Son, I see your shadow everywhere...</p>
<p>The hometown is no longer the appearance you imagined, it has all changed, it has become so desolate, it is simply heartbreaking...</p>
<p>This heartbreaking thing, this human tragedy, son, I don't want to tell you, but, my son, how can I hide it from you? Alas, your dear little sister Cui, in the first half of the month, in the first half of the month, was sold to human traffickers by her father because of the cold and poverty, for only ten silver dollars. In the hometown, this is a common thing. Your second uncle, this is another unfortunate thing, he became a bandit two months ago, and I heard he was caught, I don't know if he is alive or dead, he was such a gentle and kind person, how could he end up like this, there is no way to avoid it...</p>
<p>Come back! A few dozen dollars is enough, I am looking forward to you day and night beside the door, son, please don't disappoint me...</p>
<p>He cried! He imagined that tragic scene: how Cui sister bid farewell to her parents, and how they made a weeping farewell, how she made her last glimpse of the hometown, a round face smeared with tears, disheveled long hair, ah, how she made her last wail to the world...</p>
<p>His heart shattered like a bomb.</p>
<p>|| Cui sister, your fate is so unfortunate!</p>
<p>He thought of his hometown, a beautiful and secluded mountain village, willows growing all around, a silver-blue winding stream flowing through the village, and every morning several girls would be here washing clothes, singing softly: in the evening, the herdsboys gathered here to water the cattle...</p>

<h3 id="e318">The Problem of Air Pollution Deserves Attention in Construction Engineering <a href="#e318" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c318" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">318</a></h3>
<p>In a metropolis like Shanghai, with a population of over three million and countless factories, the problem of air pollution, especially the smoke emitted from factory chimneys, is unavoidable. However, it seems that those involved in the design, construction, and contracting of construction projects mostly neglect this point. In fact, this is an extremely serious problem that deserves attention. In overseas countries, the issue of Air Pollution is also being studied with great enthusiasm. Now, the reporter will briefly summarize their research findings on the causes of air pollution, the impact of air pollution on buildings, and points to note in design, in three sections as follows:</p>
<p>Causes of Air Pollution</p>
<p>In cities, the biggest cause of air pollution is undoubtedly the uncontrolled emissions from various factory chimneys, as well as fugitive dust, air leaks, brick dust, metal filings, and other weathered particles from various places. These are not present in the air, but gradually mix in, and the air gradually changes from pure to polluted. Since smoke and dust are the main causes of air pollution, the impurities in the pollution can also be imagined. Fuel contains a lot of carbon and a small amount of sulfur. After combustion, the emissions are nothing more than carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, sulfur trioxide, and other species. In addition, ammonium hydroxide may also be mixed in. These oxides, once hydrated, easily turn into oxygen, such as carbonic acid, such as sulfuric acid, which are the most common pollutants in the air.</p>
<p>Impact of Air Pollution on Buildings After the air is polluted, its impact on buildings can be discussed in terms of water-based materials and steel-based materials. Regarding water-based materials, such as stone, cement, mortar, and cement, etc. They are used in large quantities on the exterior of buildings. If they are polluted by carbon ash and dust, it will impair their appearance, which is not a shallow matter. However, this can still be washed with water. If it is polluted by coal tar sprayed from the chimneys in the air, its adhesiveness will cause it to deeply embed into the pores of the stone, and it will be impossible to remove. After being eroded by tannic acid and other substances in the air, the surface of the building will begin to peel off and will not be as beautiful as before.</p>
<p>Stones such as limestone, marble, and olivine contain more calcium carbonate and are easily corroded; granite, gneiss, and sandstone contain very little and are relatively resistant to damage. Thus, the beauty of the exterior will be almost completely deprived.</p>
<p>Cement and cement-based materials will undergo acidification due to the lime content, resulting in gypsum neoformation. Also this will cause the volume of the aluminum salts contained in them to expand more than three times. This internal swelling force will greatly affect the resistance of the cement and cement-based materials.</p>
<p>Mortar, because it contains too many pores, is affected even more severely.</p>
<p>Regarding steel-based materials, steel, iron, copper, zinc, etc. are used. Their surface is polluted in the same way as water-based materials, and there is also the disadvantage of rust.</p>
<p>Copper and iron are the most easily damaged by polluted air. Although they can be plated with zinc or tin, the damage is even more severe once the coating is broken, and corrosion will follow. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e319">On Sandstone as the Only Material for Building Acid Pools in Acid-Producing Factories <a href="#e319" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c319" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">319</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, with the rapid advancement of building materials, almost all previous applications of natural stone blocks as materials have now been replaced by steel, metal, and other man-made materials. Even if they exist, they are only a few or only for decoration purposes. However, it should be known that steel and cement are easily corroded by high-temperature acid liquids, resulting in the weakness of peeling and crumbling, which is not as resistant as natural stone. Therefore, the current trend is that for the construction of acid pools in heavy industrial factories, the material of choice is natural sandstone, because if steel is used for construction, the surface of the steel must be electroplated with a very thick zinc layer to resist corrosion, and if pig iron is used, it must also be protected by enamel. However, the enamel itself is very easy to fall off, so it cannot be used perfectly; as for wood materials, of course, they cannot withstand even a touch of high-temperature strong acid. However, facts and experience have long shown us that stone slabs and strips are more resistant to oxygen corrosion. The key points of various acid-resistant preparations seem to have their own secrets in each area. The only consideration is that sandstone naturally has the ability to resist oxygen corrosion and does not need to be equipped.</p>
<p>Sandstone is one of the sedimentary rocks. Its main component is sand, hence the name sandstone. The rock bed is formed by water, so there are sequences. The rock texture is composed of sand grains of different sizes, so it is inconsistent. The most common silica it contains is quartz (Ouaf), with the rest being iron and others, in addition to very few impurities. Its color ranges from gray, grayish white, to beef color, brown, red, etc., each different due to the dynamic variation in the proportion of minerals contained. The more quartz there is, the lighter the color, and even completely white. If there is more iron, the color gradually deepens. Therefore, the proportion of various substances it contains can be determined by the appearance of the color. The reason why it can resist oxygen is that a large amount of quartz in the minerals it contains can not be corroded by acid. It is known that sandstone with a white color and more quartz is more suitable for this type of acid pool building material, which is one point to pay attention to when selecting materials for construction. In addition, for reliable construction, we can further use a detailed method for chemical analysis, which can obtain more accurate composition. In addition to seeking a large amount of quartz, it is also necessary to seek the absolute absence of iron, otherwise, the iron will be washed away by the acid, and the stone itself will be damaged, which will affect the entire construction. Furthermore, a method of microscopic examination can be used to study in detail the rock texture, crystalline form, and color, which can increase the degree of precision. When the stone inspection is ready and the stone selection is determined, the stone can be quarried, cut into pieces, and construction can begin. The method of construction, the four walls and the bottom, and the shape of the pool, need not be said much. The longer and wider the stone pieces, the better, because more stone seams mean more leaks, which is quite inappropriate. The carving craftsmanship at each joint must be carefully considered, and asbestos can be used as a bonding material to increase the transverse pressure of the acid liquid stored in the water. Steel bars can be hoop around the outer wall of the stone pool to enhance its durability. However, the position of the steel hoops must be one foot or more above the normal maximum acid storage level in the pool to be foolproof.</p>
<p>In addition, there are many points that should be paid attention to in the construction of acid pools. If steam heating pipes are used to increase the temperature of the acid liquid, the material must be chrome-vanadium steel, tungsten-molybdenum steel, codait-molybdenum steel, and other similar alloys to resist oxygen corrosion. Sandstone that contains limestone should never be used, because limestone is easily acidified, which must also be noted.</p>
<p>Heavy industry in China can be said to be still in its infancy. There are only two or three oxygen manufacturing plants. Subsequently, the development of such factories is necessary for industrial development, and the construction of this type of acid pool is also indispensable. Among the three acids, sulfuric, nitric, and hydrochloric, concentrated sulfuric acid is the most severe. Unfortunately, in the past, it was difficult to obtain the best acid-resistant material for building acid pools. I have written this article to share with the public, because our country is vast and rich in resources and has many mountains. Although the production of sandstone is not as high as that of limestone, it cannot be said that it is insufficient for future industrial development. I hope that the construction industry will pay attention to this.</p>

<p>Storage room, this is a room that must be equipped in rural buildings, because in the countryside, the most important thing is the so-called "autumn harvest and winter storage". Storing food is the most important issue, and the life of farmers is entirely tied to this storage work. In rural buildings in European and American countries, the most important room is also the storage room. In the storage room, protection is particularly meticulous, and the lifeline of a farmer's family lies entirely here. The periphery of the storage room is generally arranged to make storage more convenient, without any obstacles, and after storing items, it can be closed tightly to prevent insects and other things from entering. Storage in European and American countries is mainly wheat, and storage in our country is mainly rice, so the storage is the same, and when equipping this storage room, one should consider the size of the items that this family wants to store, otherwise, there may be too little or too much space, causing farmers to not be very welcome to this storage room. As for the old-fashioned granary equipment, that is no longer suitable for current use.</p>
<p>In addition to the storage room, there is the residence. The residence does not need to be built as a multi-story building. Of course, it is not suitable for farmers to build multi-story houses under their economic conditions, but hygiene must be taken into account when building, so that there will be no difficult health problems for farmers. If it is a place where many farmers live together, then a dormitory-style house can be built. Although this type of equipment is very difficult to use in rural areas, there is such equipment in European and American rural areas, and there is no reason why dormitory-style houses cannot be applicable in our country. In addition, a public entertainment venue or meeting place should also be established in each rural village. This can both improve farmers' knowledge and provide farmers with considerable comfort, which is also essential.</p>
<p>In European and American rural buildings, there are usually three-bay houses, with two rooms all storage rooms, and a vacant room in the middle where cars can drive in (European and American farmers have small freight cars), which is convenient for storage, and the residence is inside, but this type of architecture is not yet applicable in our country's rural areas.</p>
