<p>時評</p>
<h3>讀新生活運動會改革禮俗辦法有感恒。</h3>
<p>目前本市新生活運動促進會。擬定改革禮俗辨法。對於婚喪壽宴等之大事。皆有相當規定。用減社會奢侈靡麗之風。意殊善也。蓋婚喪之事。原在盡禮。過此已往。一切鋪張。無非炫耀示闊。博人贊嘆而已。究其實際。不能不謂爲無聊也。在富厚之家。乘時熱烘。固無損於經濟。然力薄之人。受此風尚之支配。羣相效尤。則不獨直接影響其個人之經濟與事業。且將間接影響於社會國家之福利也。</p>
<p>我國今日。外扼於強鄰之壓迫。內困於國民經濟之破產。國勢危殆。不可終日。於此之時。非全體國民。刻苦自勵。敞屣虛榮。以從事於生產發明研究及文化建設事業。實不足以救危亡。顧社會奢侈虛浮之風。一日不除。則個人雖欲刻苦自勵。奮勉有爲。亦有所難能。我國運所寄託者。無過於青年。今一般紈袴子弟無諭已。即號稱優秀者。亦大抵專在政界中得一優缺。或於工商界中獲一薪資優厚之地位。志願以一生從事於科學發明及生產建設等之工作者。殊寥寥無幾也。此種現象。何自來乎。豈非因個人虛榮之心太重。有以致之乎。青年有爲者若是。幾何而不使全國之人。羣趨於勢利之途乎。</p>
<p>夫西洋文明之所以能高出於我者。原因雖多。然其個人得失之心。不若我國人之甚。要爲一大關建。而其所謂偉大人格者。亦多側重於科學家發明家之一方。我人試讀歐洲之科學史或發明史。即知西洋過去之大科學家與大發明家。每多竊乏潦倒。不得志於其生時。唯其志在研究發明。故亦安於貧賤困苦而不求其他。設彼以世俗之虛榮利祿爲念。則亦何能有成哉。</p>
<p>今觀新生活運動促進會所擬之規律。善則善矣。顧於嚴格實施之道。似未計及。則仍有美中不足之遣憾。蓋徒有規則。而無實行之道。與無規則。又何以異。以我人管見。此事實須從上層階級做起。而政界要人。尤須以身作則。古語云。上之所好。下必有甚焉者矣。猶此意也。即以崇檢一端爲言。下層階級實已無可再儉。上層階級如能率先提倡。則中層之人。自必翕然從風。可以不懲而自勸也。余意儉爲美德。貴顯而能崇儉。裨益更多。誠欲揚顯聲名。舒殿豪闊。亦儘可將其金錢用於正當途徑。如捐。作貧苦學子之免費學額。與建築公共圖書館醫院科學院之類。吾人爲實施上項辦法計。似可組織一勸導團。賦以相當權力。從事推廣。至於詳細辦法。則有望於從事新生活運動者之精心籌劃也。</p>

<h3>進羅又醖釀政變</h3>
<p>現政府剝奪王權</p>
<p>王表示退位力爭</p>
<p>倫敦　暹羅王遜位之說雖經還王御用文牘否認、但還王左右今日發表正式文告、宣稱、陛下尸位素餐無補國是、切望早御仔肩以避賢路云、按暹王倦勸之說、係盤谷英使館最初傳至新加坡政府官員、僑居倫敦之還王文牘隨之聲明否認、惟今日之正式文千已證實暹王遜位之說、且透露還羅國內醖釀政變之事、是則暹羅今後之政局、非久居歐洲之君主歸位、即盤谷國會政府主政、今日之文告係以還王名義而發、據稱、陛下既與國會政府不睦、因思退位以讓現政府、蓋以陛下將爭點訴諸民意之主張即不能行、則既無法維護民權自由、猶復留戀權位、於國於已兩無裨益也、文告中復指稱、國會近頃通過新刑法、國王沇核準、而主張將此事付之公民表決或國會改選、以明暹羅爲立憲君主而非專制君主之國、王與政府所爭者爲一暹羅舊法、根遽該法、君主操生殺之權、國會今加修正、規定國君祗有特赦權、使暹羅得與其他立憲君主國相埒、關於國會對國王私產之賦稅政策、文告中未提及、惟於盤谷英使館之電報中見之、（二十八日國民電）</p>
<h3>暹王權力被奪</h3>
<p>驚人謠言不足信</p>
<p>新加坡　據盤谷英國使館消息、暹羅國王民決意遜位、還王聞於上星期即已自請退位、惟政府未接受、暹王之意係因政府頒相新刑法、以後死罪改用槍決、廢止斬首　且廢止人民向國王請願之權、如此則國王僅餘之權力、亦被剝奪、另據消息靈通者稱、羅王對於政府之賦稅政策、關於國王私產一部、亦表示不滿、查暹羅原爲專制君主國、至一九三二年六月廿四日革命後、改爲君主立憲政體、憲法規定最高主權屬睹人民全體、國王爲一國元首、行政權則由國民黨黨員十五人所組織之委員會執堂云、（廿七日國民電）倫敦　暹王遜位之決意、引起關於暹羅政局之驚人謠言、昨夜有人擬從倫敦與盤谷通訊、但終未成功、迄至今晨、暹羅局勢依然未明、倫敦現有暹羅已發生革命之謠言、今日新加坡電訊謂盤谷關於函電、現檢查甚嚴、又有一消息、謂暹羅陸軍現分兩派、一則擁護暹王、一則反對之、現政府除陸相比泊爾外、未有重要暹王堅欲辭職、則政府或將擇王室中少年一人奉之爲君、而另組織攝政會、但衆料暹人雖忠於國王、然共和政體之宣佈、亦意中事、頃據盤谷路透電訊、還王並未切實遜位、不過暹王與政府互換關於暹羅君主政府與國會間憲法關係之意見耳、許多人民希望暹王不久返國、因其目疾現已漸愈也、現未有散佈驚人謠言之理由、（二十七日路透電）</p>

<p>倫敦　暹王現偕后隱居英國克蘭萊之諾爾公園、茲對其政府露遜位之意、據王之私人秘書今日語路透訪員、現王尚未簽定遜位之女件、按暹羅國會近通過一法案、修改刑律中凡判處罪犯死刑或終身徒刑必須由國王準可之規定、王不允批準該案、謂須先徵求國民之意見、但國會不從王之要求、於是王覺其不復能保衛國民之權利與自由、在位無益、故遂有遜位之意、克蘭萊王之寓所、今日有警察嚴加防衛、按暹王所以拒絕批準該法案者、因國會並非爲國民之完全代表、其半數議員乃由首相巴賀爾委派、故暹王以爲此種新律、應交國民投票公決、暹王因患目疾、本年六月問曾在倫敦經醫施用手術、去其左目醫障、現因右目亦有醫障、不日將施第二次之手術、王於一九二五年踐祚、現年四十一、甚得民心、暹羅政體、本爲獨載制、一九三二年一月暹王遊於海外時、國內發生革命、要求民治、暹王鑒於世界之潮流、遂下詔實施立憲君主制、革命風潮、乃告憲靜、但在舊朝佔高位之軍人、多不滿意於民治、去年六月、鹽軍統司令巴賀爾將軍藉清除赤化爲名、推倒政府、而自組政府、獨攬大權、同時前國防大臣波夫拉臺吉親王等率衆起抗巴氏、致暹羅陷於內戰之中、歷兩星期之久、暹王不欲爲任何黨所挾制、出亡馬來邊界之辛哥拉、至十二月始回京召集新國會、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<h3>奧國內部不安</h3>
<p>各黨傾軋醖釀事變</p>
<p>維也納當局已準備</p>
<p>維也納　奧國各主要政黨因彼此意見不洽、致又有內亂之醖釀、內衛圑即與德國社黨意黑衫黨相同之半軍事機關、因不滿於法西斯主義之進行、故日來社會黨將再起革命之謠言頗熾、今日亦城當道已準備一切、所防車變、同時抽調軍隊中長期服役士兵三百人、協同警察維護秩序、衆意社會黨之武裝雖佳、但如於目下起事、則無異自殺也、若干社會黨員以爲一切謠言、乃由當局傳出、俾便實行壓制計畫、同時又有一事、爲政府所焦慮者、總理許希尼格所領導之隊伍、與內衛圑水火頗甚、雙方目前均、竭力擴張武備、衆恐十一月可根據奧國新憲法委派基爾特及顧問圑體人員時、雙方之衙突、將不能免、當局刻竭力避免嚴重之騒擾、政府之代表等今日下午由總理許希尼格領導與反對鐵及與德國國明黨接近之黨派會晤、企圖銷除異見、討論之內容、基於三點、一承認奧國之獨立、二拒絕任何國家干涉奧國內政、三避免政治上相爭之暴行、討論雖無結果、但將繼續進行、（二十六日路透電）</p>
<p>羅斯福</p>
<h3>當前問題</h3>
<p>平衡預算與進行復興</p>
<p>華盛頓羅斯福總統不久將集中金力於預算及永久復與法問題、羅氏大概將與財政部及預算處人員以及國會領袖非正式討論、以便詳細研究政府之收入及各部之支出、總統當前之問題非常困難、因六七八三月商業情形退步、以致本經濟年度之前三個半月中、收入較之預算已短少美金一千萬元、而政府之救濟費用大爲增加、上年聯邦政府之支出爲歷來平時支出最大之一年、以全國人民計算、每人約費五十六元、當時之希望爲商業可由之而得轉機、數千萬之貧困民衆亦可得政府救濟然政府之收入、平均每人祗合二十五元、與支出相較竟茲三十一元、現在總統意欲國會通過永久救濟法、使政府已往所得之進步可以鞏固、而使與經濟恐慌奮門之方法廣大範圍、蓋府最大之目的雖爲減除目前之困苦、然總統亦欲籌擬將來較大之計劃、以失爾保險養老金計劃以及其他改革方法使國家不致再受已往四年來經濟恐慌之痛苦也、（二十七日國民電）</p>
<p>美海軍官員演說</p>
<h3>堅持強大海軍</h3>
<p>海軍爲外交之後盾</p>
<p>華盛頓今日爲海軍紀念日、海軍部調遣處代理處長陶雪格上將演說、稱美國外交政策之力量、實以美國海軍之力量爲根據、海軍之基本政策在於寺充足實力、即於交涉失敗時、亦足爲美國政府之商業及外交政策之後盾、他國欲廢棄或減小戰艦、因彼等深知僅事減少艦隊力量、或彼等已國之海軍亦同等減縮、即可使美國最受影響、蓋以美國於海軍根據地及商船兩項皆咸不足也、故美國對於海軍務須保持其條約所許可之最大實力、陶氏繼復盛稱海軍之價值、謂吾國外交政策重要殊甚、其力量實以海軍之力量爲根據、此點陶氏大概係指遠東之門戶開放政策及門羅主義而言、彼亦述及保護美國之海外領土及巴拿馬運河之重要、而稱海軍爲抵抗空軍襲擊美國大陸及保護美國之海外領土及巴拿馬運河之重要、而稱海軍爲抵抗空軍襲擊美國大陸及其他各處之最良自衛武器、其言曰、目下飛機尚不能滿載炸彈或他種毀滅性之戰具遠渡重洋、故吾人所應顧及之空軍獲擊、祗爲離吾人海岸一千英里以內敵人軍艦上之飛機、惟此等軍艦於空中襲擊可以舉行之前、當已早被擊沉矣（二十七日國民電）</p>
<h3>英美今日會議</h3>
<p>海軍談判至緊要關頭</p>
<p>倫敦　英美兩國代表現定下星期一日繼續舉行海會初步談話、消息靈通人士認爲此項談話關係重要、緣英國屆時將對日本海軍提案第一次發表其見解故也英國代表將勸美國採取妥協態度、或並提出折衷方案、亦屬可能、惟美國首席代表臺維斯及其他代表接受英國意見與否則無從逆料、若果如外間所推測、美日兩國代表、於下星期二日重行會商、則海軍談判之命運將取決於此、而美日談話之命運如何又當視下星期一日英美談話之結果爲斷也、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　英美第一次會商訂於二十九日開始、至英美間之預備折衝早已於本年七月中進行至某稱程度、最近亦舉行非正式會談、彼此交換意見、但二十九日之會商將登毫正式開演、並即有相當實質問題之討論、該會商之前程對於日本主張之實現、當給與現實之影響、英美兩國之態度對於既存條約之存續及導守比率主義保留其他航空母艦廢除或限制潛水艦等之問題、意見上原已接近、至爲明頭、但在防守東本兩洋之領土起見、閟須主張多數小艦主義、此爲英國方面之辦法、美國在渡洋作戰之立塲上、無論如何、須固執其大長艦巨砲主義、故英美兩國在原則上實處於對跡之立塲、如何方能調和此頭項完全相反之原則、即爲英美間折衝成功與否之運命所擊者也云、（二十八日日聯電）</p>
<h3>英日會談內容</h3>
<p>東京　此間綜合各方面之情報云、二十六日之日英專家會議席上、日英兩國代表關於技術上之細節彼此披瀝見解、結果將共通最大限度及其他根本原則除去、在艦種分別細節、對於航空母潛水艦以外各點、似已確認有極其共通之點、茲將日英兩國主張之重要部分列於左、</p>
<p>一（英）保留華府與倫敦兩條約之骨格、（日）以共通最大限度爲基礎、訂立全然個別之新條約、</p>
<p>二、（英）採取艦種分別限制主義、（日）採取與艦總噸數主義、但未廢除主力艦時當在例外、</p>
<p>三、（英）主力艦之艦型、以二萬五千噸、砲口訂爲十二時總噸數、須加以若干縮少、</p>
<p>（日）倘經各國同意贊成廢除、而於保留時、則將艦型總噸數等情形與各國協議、然後決定、</p>
<p>四、（英）反對廢除航空母艦、主張縮少艦型及其總噸數等等、</p>
<p>（日）主張絕對廢除、</p>
<p>五、（英）對於高級巡洋艦維持現狀、</p>
<p>（日）此項主張雖無大異、但以盡量短少爲是、</p>
<p>六、（英）乙種巡洋艦之艦型限制爲六千至七千噸、艘數訂爲七十艘以上、倘有增加必要時、當認定由其他艦種之噸數與以通融、</p>
<p>（日）在總噸數主義之立塲上、贊成其通副辦法</p>
<p>七、（英）對潛水艦主張廢除或大加縮少、（日）主張在必要量上自由建造、（二十八日日聯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　此間報界對於倫敦海軍談判之觀察、雖承認英日兩國意見歧異、未易尅制、但亦以爲至少一部份之成功、未嘗不可以獲致、星期泰晤士報載稱、此次海軍談判、決不當失敗、即關係三國中任何一國、亦皆不欲聽念失敗、蓋一旦海軍談判失敗、而各國從事於海軍竸賽、則在政治經濟上之結果、皆屬可驚、至在吾國、則爲種種理由、其希望協調之成立尤切、蓋吾國國民、對外既無現實或潛伏之仇怨、而又置有巨型艦類、足以保障帝國之交通、與其商路也、惟海軍談判所爭持者、表面上爲艦種與此率問題、而實際尚有政治上之異見、故各方意見之未能融洽、乃顯益增甚、是故海軍專家雖得政府之援助、然本問題之糾結、則益根深蒂固、非海軍專家所能處理者矣、</p>
<p>爲今之計、如欲避免上述異見、宜由英美日三國就廣大之甚礎、作公開之談你、以代表現所舉行之海軍談判、而其目的則在藉三方面之協定、以解決目前顯露之問題也、云云、星期公論報則由政治與經濟上觀察、以爲在海軍問題上、英日兩國間之協定、殆已不可避免、其言曰、目前之倫敦海軍談判、應由下列之見解觀察之、即英日兩國商務上之合作、足以引致兩國政治上之合作是也、關於此點、毫無秘密之處、現當說明者、即英國在滿洲國鉅額投資問題使滿洲國之安寗與英國有至大關係、英日兩國在經濟上獲得協調、則其在軍事上與海軍上之恊調、既屬可能、且爲必要、倫敦海軍談判席上、美國代表之所以疑忌者、其故即在此、蓋若輩深懼在未來海軍會議之前、英國兩國間已造成一種已成之事實也、（二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>德國社黨之種族觀念</h3>
<p>德國排斥猶太人、內幕如何、鮮有人知悉、茲據國社黨種族政治部部長葛羅斯所談如次、在去年新國社主義的德國根據專門專家於最新種族學術研究上所得到的成績、初訂各種法規的時候、世界上一部份之民族對於這種設施有誤解的、有誤會的、不過如有猶太人挑撥、站在這種誤解觀念身後、我們是可以不顧一切的、至於國外之論調、有一部份如猶太人他們本身、對於在這樣種族學術上研究獲得成績所訂之法律、根本上是不願了解的、大可聽其自然、還有世界上一部份的觀念、是抱大同主義的、認爲推行種族觀念、在政治上、是否有危險性的、至於世界上一部份人不能了解這種在種族學術上獲得、成績所訂之法規、我們實在是要引以爲怪的、因一次大部份之文化民族、迄今對於種族觀念本甚堅持、譬如英國人對於各種民族在他的國中於種族純潔原則上、是很注意的、可是這些民族方面對於英國人也持同樣並明瞭的態度、來保守他們種族上之尊註、有這種原因、所以有許多印度人、尤其日本人、絕不至聽共種族與白種人相混亂、而由雙方盡力保守各人種族上之純潔、這種獨力保守各人種族上之純潔、這種行爲、可說向來沒有影響到政治及社交的、有人指摘德國將異種人（如猶太人）排斥出官廳服務處所之舉動是不對的、其實在其他國中、也有這樣相同的設施、我們先拿美國人一種行爲作一個國際先例的引證、譬如美國人在政治及社交生活中對於黑人之態度、可視爲一種蓄意的人種上之歧視、尤以在移民法律中美國人對於由歐洲移往彼國各種之民族、有很明顯的分別、關於由美國政府所規定移民數目、對於歐洲的各國也是很不相同的、這樣有分別的目的、是歡迎與美國人類相同的民族、可以多數移往該國、至於對另一方面目的是阻此世界上一部份種族上之精神不與美國一致的人前往、由美國主觀上說、類似美國之民族移入美國、於美國國家關係上是特有價值的、如果拿這一種先例作一比較、實在是令人驚異的、就是世界各國在法律上界上大部分各種種族有很大的分別、然而世界上大部分爲什麼不明白德國的依樣葫蘆、或國對於德國國社主義下之種族主義不十分明瞭耳、現今所以要明曰解釋的、就是德國國社主義、對於世界上之種族是同樣看待的、我們國社黨員更有鄭重聲明的、就是世界上之民族、應各自保有天賦之文化性質、國社主義對於人類種族之混亂、認爲於雙方間之文化性質是有危險性的、德國國社主義對於人類上混亂之觀察、與遠東民族之觀察、是一致的、遠東民族如中國人於數千年來、由家族主義保持其家族之純潔、真是可令人依爲法的、所以在這種範圍中、新德國實爲中國文化及智慧上之門徒、凡對於此已了解者、則用判斷在外國所宣傳、國社主義下之種族觀念、對於在德之異種居客係仇視的、確係誤會、再進一步言之、此種仇視觀念、在國社主義中可說是絕無僅有的、非係反對者蓄意秘密之煸惑、或即係對於希特對者蓄意秘密之煽惑、或即係對於希特勒之世界觀念不能明瞭、吾輩德人經過數百年之迷途、今始認清我們血統上之原性及其價值、按每一種族、具有一已之特別天才、這樣天才是不能受各種種族無意識之混亂、而被摧殘的、讐如中國人及蒙古人在德國僑居、各能保持自有種族上之尊嚴、我們德國人自然從現在也應保守我們種族上之尊嚴、此與政治上及私人社交上、在主客之間、均能維持其感情、而不致發生若何影譽的、因吾人待遇吾人之友、有其應盡之禮貌、並對於異於僑賓之才能、尤爲崇拜、故亦盼對方對於吾人之才能、亦有同樣之印象、所以國社主義下之種族主義、不僅剝除種族上之仇視及門爭、實則創發互相敬愛之精神、可視爲世界民族上和平之基礎、吾人之責任在國內及國外均應對於這樣種族觀念之誤解努力摒除、俾得世人之諒解、凡對於國社主義上種族觀念作不實之宣傳者、均係我們的敵人、因爲這全是一種挑撥會倆、以破壞吾人領袖希特勒及認清種族之德國國民龔其他僑德人士之友誼云、（國民社德國通信）</p>

<p>加里寗論</p>
<h3>蘇俄選舉工作</h3>
<p>莫斯科蘇聯中央執行委員會主席加里寗今日在各報發表一文、其言曰、蘇維埃選舉運動已將到臨、此舉在政治上有非常的意義、蘇聯勞苦難衆在政治與文化方面、均已大有發展、其於國家紀律與國家責任之了解亦大有增進、今世各國、欲求其羣衆與國保持密切關係、並有機的關心一般國家政策、如蘇聯者、可稱絕無、此語要非過首也、蘇聯以其世大之成就、迎受其新選舉運動、此等成就之獲得、自須多量犠牲、需有多量之勞動、精力與堅忍、蘇聯重工業日臻獨立之大道、其發展之特點乃在用吾人自有之方法與蘇聯自製之機器、建造並裝置其偉大建築、就技術觀點而言、吾國對於資本主義世界之依賴正日益減弱、工業之發達、特別爲農業機器之生產、令吾人能採用集體耕作製度、同時令農民有參加社會主義社會之建設、加里寗述及蘇聯國際情勢時、則稱、數年以前、各種軍事計劃尚力向大衆隱瞞、時至今日若干國家乃公開宣傳戰爭、並以嘲諷之態度爲戰爭大登廣告、至於其他國家、亦正利用此點以擴充其軍備、吾國來日之選舉將向世界表示、蘇聯之面目畢竟完全不同、蘇聯正在實現列寗所抱以上形式之奴役中將人類解放出來之理想云、（二十七日塔斯電）</p>

<h3>英國紡織工業的難關</h3>
<p>現有市塲不易維持</p>
<p>當前強敵愈見強大</p>
<p>英國是真有點老了、在形式上誠然還勉強保持著海上王地位、似乎還可以領導現在世界的產業、占據海上商務的首位、但是實際情形已經發生變化、特別是最近三四年更加厲害、例如關開夏的紡織工業、是英國首屆一指的主要工業、而歷年來總是向下襄退、與他遠東的好友、棉業市塲強敵日本相比較、更見落後、縱然、他今年上半年對歐洲的棉布輪出增加了百分之十有奇、對北美增加了百分之六十、這都是渥大華英帝國經濟會議以來施行了集團經濟的成績、也是英國整個國民經濟的良好景象、</p>
<p>然而在亞洲方面、對中國今年上半期棉布輪出、較去年同時期減少了百分之五、六、對日本輸出減少了百分之四、對香港輸出減少了百分之七。六、對菲律濱輸出減少百分之六。四、對非洲各地（包含英領殖民地在內）總計起來差不多減少了百分之三、對南美各國輸出減少了百分之零。六、綜合全體計算、英國對外棉布輸出減少了百分之十五、這種形勢、使英國紡織工業、不能不感到前途的荊棘叢生、未來難關之不易渡過、</p>
<p>因此他不能不趕緊另行設法、以挽回將來的厄運、阻止目前這種情形的再壞下去、現世界各國都在那裹努力實行集團經濟、獎勵輸出、限制輸入、換一名話講、就是加緊海外的經濟竸爭、實行國內的經濟、獎勵輸出、限制輸入、換一句話講、不是加緊海外的經濟竸爭、實行國內的經濟統制、但是英國素來是看重自由主義經濟的、他近來雖竭力實行英帝國內的集團經濟、而生產上市塲價格上都還含著非合理的竸爭、祗要有這種原素存在、英國對外竸爭即處於不利益地位、所以他現時最重要的問題、是考虛到如何打破蘭開夏各工廠主傳統的個人主義、使他們都能一致贊同下列的改革計劃、一取締紡織工業家彼此間的竸爭、在爲這種競爭、單就表面上看、好像於消費者有利、也是產業界進步的好現象、可是目下時代已經不同了、技術的進步差不多快到頂點了、所以同業間相競爭、是陷本身於不利的、爲一致對外步調起見、必須限制這種國內國業的競爭、要設法統一價格、統制生產、</p>
<p>二整理過剩的紡錠、英國紡紗廠設備比較的舊了、機械組織之不尖時代需求、是大家所深知的、而海外市塲爲人所侵占、又無可諱言、則過乘的紡錠如果不加整理淘汰、那是產業界自已的損失、不過英國紡織業所以爲此衰退的原因、像上面所講的是他本身的缺點、此外還有別的關係、例如當世各國都努力於國內的自給自足、所以就增加開稅、致英國出品不能如願輸出、加之後進諸國如中國。印度。等重工業雖一時未能發展、可是輕工業、特別是紡織工業、卻未能發達得很快、何況他們國內一般工資都比較便宜、原料的運輸也很方便、於是英國就漸次失去了他的原有市傷、再則後起的日本、非但輕工業有相當的進步、并且利用共低廉的工資、便利的運輸、以及經濟的特殊條件、（如政治關係與日金跌價等）竟飛躍的發展、甚至於遍世界各地與英國相竸賽、凡是英國紡織品的市塲、就同時有日本製品和他競爭、其次、是各農業國家都受世界經濟恐慌的影響、原料輸出既不免停滯、對製造品的輸入、當然會減低、一般社會的購買力都減退下去、英國紡織品是比較高級的、價格比較貴、更使他們難於購輞了、因此紡織工業失衆的人數竟有百分之二四。四、其他各業平均不過百分這一六。六、這是當前的大問題、是英國最苦心焦盧而難於解決的、（九月二十七日於倫敦）</p>
<h3>日人急圖日僞貨幣同盟</h3>
<p>促進僞組織改用金本位制</p>
<p>意在併吞僞組織之經濟權</p>
<p>日文上海每日新聞紀載、滿洲國之貨幣制度、將由銀本位制改爲金本位制、惟其實現時期興方法等技術問題、尚待一般的諒解、日前高橋銀吉、爲視察滿洲經濟赴滿、覧於金銀匯兌上、滿洲人經濟之困難化、與日本貨幣流通數之減少、成爲反比例、極力主張滿洲之經濟、原與中國有密切關係、故突然脫離中國關係、而爲經濟的獨立、不得不加慎重的考虛、此次在長春開第十八次全滿商議聯合會議時、曾以本位貨幣制度問題與直接關係等、提出重要議案、主張日滿婦結貨幣同盟、此案之性質、頗爲重大、決非短時間所能解決、其後因在會中不能決定、移交繼續委員會附議、查當時哈爾濱商工會議之說明書、其主張大要、即哈爾濱商工、對於日滿兩國之政治經濟國防等、均認爲不可分離、其經濟的分野、應先結成經濟同盟、一爲日滿關稅同盟、二日滿貨幣同盟、此二大問題、實爲日滿經濟同盟縮結上之基礎工作、然而滿洲的經濟現狀、與現行制度之關係、加以解剖批評後、再由歸納的方法、聯絡日滿貨幣關係、故在滿日本商工業者之希望、第一、國幣價值商工之低下、第二、日滿貨幣價值關係之安定、蓋由本質上而言、一日滿兩國、應取同一貨幣制度、二兩國貨幣價值關係、應使其穩定、現因第一種不易實現、故急謀後者之安定、其所提示日滿貨幣同盟締結之現實方法、略以由日本銀行讓受六千萬元、爲滿洲中央銀行之淮備、即以此爲正貨準備、發行銀行券、交付滿洲中央銀行、作正貨準備、發行所需國幣銀行券云云、</p>

<h3>淞漢領港糾紛</h3>
<p>淞漢領港、自經海關主持、頒行新章、限制國人原有領港結關服務、引起航商及領港人等反對風潮、相持迄今、已將匝月、雙方僅持、大有意演急烈之勢、昨日又新有發展、茲錄經過其詳情如次、</p>
<p>不準結關　海關此次考取之領港、約五十餘人、由上海引水管理委員會容納此輩、以備帶領進出長江各輪之需、該會成立以來、中外航商、因其新增之領港費、過於昂貴、一致反對、堅不儒用、以致該會領港終日試閒、並無生意、於是海關再進一步、風行非該會之領港不爲結關之辦法、</p>
<p>外商反對　海關既不結關、多數領港、大爲狼狽、生計方面、至感困難、羣情激憤、正在討論對付之際、昨適有日商大同公司代理之挪威輪二艘。及英商赍賜公司之茂勒等輪、駛往漢口、自價領港、海關乃實行不準結關之乎段、該兩公司經理受此打擊、大爲憤怒、以所派領港、服務有十餘年之久、執有中國海軍部執照、當時親往海關詰責、並聲明決不偏用引水委員會之領港、如果彊迫、則改用外國領港、但所付較鉅之領港費數百元、須由海關賠償損失、爭議結果、果由海關讓步、對於赍賜公司之兩艘輪船、一艘準其結關、一艘另商辦法、大回公司之挪威輪、則改用日人領港、</p>
<p>領港詰責　外輪結關問題、雖暫告一小段落、但長期領港、則以大同公司之生意、向爲國人所充任、今爲海關破壞、反爲外人佔去、全體不服擁至海關、推出代表、向引水委員會主任柯斐斷質問其舉行考試取消長期領港所執之海軍部執照、任意專擅、欺侮國人、此種權力、究爲何人賦與、柯斐爾理屈詞窮、支吾其詞、不得要領、後水警聞訊、到塲調解、幸未肇事、</p>
<p>航會表示　領港人等退出海關之後、又折赴五馬路航業公會請願、其時該會正在開會探聞發表談話、以航業公會對於海關所定之引水費、決不承認、本會爲船東地位、凡執有海軍部執照、具有服務成績之合法領港、本會有自由僱用之權、對於海關壓迫國人領港一點、極願援助、必反對到底、最後步驟、不借停航力爭云、</p>

<p>三內蒙政治中心之百靈廟　貝勒廟，原名鴻釐寺，漢音誤爲百靈廟，廟在武川縣北二百七十里，離歸化城三百六十里，房屋二百餘座，俱爲方形平頂之西藏式，梵宮寶塔，莊嚴藥置，係康煕間取內帑所建，廟產周圍四里，有九山口，盡極險要，交通有大路三條，東通錫林郭勒盟，北通外蒙，西北可去新疆西藏，廟前有一小河，名哈爾紅河，民國二年張紹曾與外蒙大將伊落職於百靈廟，即以河之東西，爲兩軍陣地，伊落敗後，民七年再犯，蔡其洋又率兵敗之，是役百靈廟之一部彼毀，後復重修，現廟中佳有喇嘛千餘人廟之東，士山斜坡上，有蒙古包數十，即爲地方自治政務委員會辦事處，按政務會組織，有委員二十八人，下分二廳四處，獨立委員會，二廳爲秘書廳，參事廳，秘事廳又分四組，參事廳又分四科，四處爲民治上實業，敎育，治安，獨立委員會爲財政委員會，實業，敎育，治安，獨立委員會爲財政委員會，專現財政，現委員長爲島蘭察佈間正盟長雲王，副委員長爲沙王，索王，但雲王沙王索王，均爲蒙古舊式王公，頭腦頑固，不知大體，雲王名雖駐首靈廟辦公，實則日在蒙古包中喝奶茶，吸鼻煙，唸佛經，一切事不聞不問，大權悉操秘書長德至一人平中，德王名德穆楚克棟普魯，爲蘇尼特右旂札薩克和碩杜陵親王，同時爲錫林郭勒盟副盟長，少年英俊，熊操英法日語，漢語亦極流利，甚得一般蒙民信仰，政務委員會，係根據中央法令之新組織，各王公旗下，仍沿舊例，王公爵位，公最小，公以上爲貝子，貝子以上爲貝勒，貝勒以上爲王，王分郡王親王，親王又大於郡王，但蒙民普通稱呼，大小王公，均稱王爺，至其行政組織，最高爲盟，盟下分旗，石旗地位高於左旗，有時可加以指揮，盟有盟長，副盟長，三盟長各一人，由各旗公選，處理全盟事務，並監督所屬，旗有札薩克一員，處理全旗事務，職係世襲，札薩克之下有東西恊理各一人，輔助札薩克處理旗務，其下又有管旗章京一人，聽命札薩克及東西恊理辦理事務，章京之下，又有東西梅楞各一人，再下尚有參領，佐領，驍騎校，領催等官名，辦理地方事務，每旗有一行政衙門，蒙名黑少沙（譯音），官吏服務，完全盡義務，不支薪給，每一官吏一年，僅服務四個月，餘外時問，仍可從事私人事業，以一旗之黑少沙諭，其日常辦事長官，正，四，七，十月爲管旗章京，二，五八，十一月東梅楞，三，六，九，十二月爲西梅楞，即書記，傳達官，庶務等下級官員，亦每一衙門有三人，輸流分期服務，蒙旗王公，略似君主立憲國之君主，位雖至尊，權限頗有限制，旗中貯藏鈐印之木箱，備有鎮鑰三，札薩克與東西恊理各執其一，若非三人完全同意，不能啟用。但內蒙各旗，舊制雖存，而對政務會之新政令，亦能接受服從，政務會政費，除由中央每月津貼三萬元外，餘由各旗分派，辦事處之蒙古包亦由各旗捐送，至於軍隊，政務會並無直轄步隊，蒙人行微兵制，男子十八以上並無直轄步隊，蒙人行徵兵制，男子十八以上，五十以下，均有當兵義務，軍隊向由各旗統洽，以前稱遊擊隊，今改稱保安隊，綏逮兩盟十三旗，共有蒙兵五千，以準噶兩旗最多，佔五分之一，今百靈廟駐軍二三百，係由各旗調來，一以保護政務會，一以使軍隊受新式訓練。政務會成立未久，而經營不遣餘力，德王及其屬下，辦事均極認真，百靈廟市塲，亦漸繁盛，哈爾紅河東，已有漢商五十餘家，人口五百，郵局亦於今年五月一日成立，惟漢蒙人民，生活方式，語言文字，升各不相同，彼此感情，不無隔膜，每因細故，互相殘殺，加以蒙人知識淺陋，多不明瞭民國組織，自地方自治政務委員會成立後，更誤解自治二字，以爲自有政治中心，不知中央爲何物，此等情形，殊非良好現象。（未完）</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第三回　和解飄零規門憐少女願聞困苦情玉訪貧家</p>
<p>胡嫂子聽了他說肯去，大喜之下，就在前面引路，一進他的門，就呌起來道：你們看看，我們小西天的老爺請了來了，志前雖是不願意他這樣的喊叫，可是也沒法子阻止他，走到那院子中間，便有一種說不出的奇見，向人黑子里，直撲了來，握住了鼻子，就向後退了兩步。那胡嫂子倒像是解事的，立刻伸著兩手，將院子里的鷄向後面轟著。在他這轟鷄的吆喝聲中，左邊一間小屋子里，出來兩個婦人，一老一少，各人手上指了一塊灰磚的東西。不時的送到口里去咀嚼，那就是所謂錯塊了。胡嫂子回轉身來，見他很注意，便笑道：我們家也有，客來了，你們也出來幫幫忙嗜，他說到這里，突然的向黃土屋子里望著，於是出來一個老太太，兩手捧了一條小矮凳子，放在院子當中，低了頭道。老爺請坐呀。他說完了，身子站立不住，幌盪著向後直倒。所幸退後兩步，就是黃土竃，他很快的手扶了竃角，才把身體給支持住了。志前看他的腳時，小得只有老菱角那麼大，一個上了年歲的人，靠這兩雙老菱角去支持他的全身，那也難怪乎他要前順後倒了。要這樣的人出來招待，倒叫人心里老大不忍的，便道：不必張羅了，老子家，我不過是想來看看，窮人是怎樣過日子的。（五一）</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （乃令）</p>
<p>九一八，不用說是我們中國的羞恥日子，但是今年的九一八，剛巧蘇聯加入國際聯盟，歐洲有許多國家都現出笑容。十月十日，不用說是我們中國的快樂日子，但是今年的十月十日，剛巧南斯拉夫國王與法國外長慘遭槍殺，歐洲有許多國家都哭喪著臉孔。一悲對一喜，一喜對一悲，真是來得巧妙啊！</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>甚至在幾處較大的缺口上，已有不少的小樹在生長著了。再過幾年，不知道將成什么模樣了，我想當初的情形，必然是和目前大不相同的！</p>
<p>我對於之一座皇城，可說是一些也沒有什么特殊的好感，雖然依據歷史上講，我們的祖先，當初就是在這一塊地皮上發揚光大起來的，我們似乎總該對它有些不同的感覺：然而這些事蹟過去得太久了，以致於使我們不容易再發生什么印象。何況我們已在景物各殊的中土住了這樣許多的年代，而那里也差不多已成了我們的第二故鄉，一切都和我們很熟悉，這里卻顛倒反覺得生疏了！我想這時候，要是我們的老祖宗再打地下走出來，和我們相會的話，我們除掉用對待陌生人的禮貌欵接他們之外，也決不會再有什么感情了。</p>
<p>要很清晰地看到這樣一幕偉大而熱鬧的喜劇。自然是不很容易：我想最好是人坐在飛機里，望下作鳥瞰，那才可以一覧無遺。不過，其時飛機這樣東西，中國卻尚不曾有過它的蹤跡咧！就是有，我也不能以一個女官的身分，駕著飛機，在空中偷覤聖駕。好在我此刻此在轎子里，一般也是居高臨下，侭可看到所要看的一切。其時最觸目的便是那兩行全副武裝的旗兵，個個都像一頭蝦蟆似的在地上俯伏著，頭低得差不多要反他們的嘴唇貼在泥土了了。他們的前面，便是那兩行臨時趕來接駕的官員。（一六一）</p>
<h3>華亭有鶴</h3>
<p>— 金雄宇</p>
<p>據松江友人王君告余：鶴產揚州最上，雄鳴上風，雌鳴下風，（墨子）鶴雖時夜鳴，而天下振動，知鶴鳴多在夜半，淮南子亦云：鷄知將旦，鶴知夜半。聲相交而孕，伏卯時見人窺之即啄破：其壽甚長，故有鶴壽千年之說。飛則舉高而遠：又善舞，（韓非子集）師曠按琴一奏，有玄鶴二八來集：再奏而列，三奏延頸而鳴，舒翼而舞，故達官巨富之家，有豢養之者，如畜之園，必近水竹，給以食。欲備蟮蟃魚榖之煩，詞之熱食則羽毛慶濁，毫無精采也。</p>
<p>華亭鶴窠之說，言傳已久，按鶴窠村即今之下沙也：考諸傳記，皆云鶴產華亭，然鶴窠一鄉村，無深林幽欲，安所棲集。惟據該處人傳說：前有白鶴一雙，自東海飛來，憇于一古柏上。久乃生雛，相與沖霄而去：其後多年，復來二鶴，徘徊村落間，或棲樹杪，或宿填圓，村民聚觀，則延頭長鳴，游行自若，其聲嘹亮，遠開二十餘里：羽毛似雪，朱頂黑尾，足高二尺餘：數日後逸翮沖霄，渺然煙滅，疑即前之雛鶴也：自後常有鶴至，故傳爲華亭之產：比年則一去不復返矣。</p>
<h3>透機橋邊女相家</h3>
<p>— 張凰</p>
<p>命相之談。新學界所擯斥，而業此者有加。國人富僥倖心理。感其興趣者實繁，智識階級且有翊爲吾國固有之哲學者。遂有賤丈夫焉，鑒於女子職業之興行，飾彼妙齡娘行而托業，授習巧言令色，往來逆旅酒家，居爲奇貨。恣其汗行，襲斷而望，指揮若定。鳴呼！爲人作嫁，一例哀鴻，傀儡生涯，母乃可惘！然而十步之內，必有芳草，此中有人，可得而述焉。</p>
<p>有女相士，曰蒼嘯虹者，華燈初上，則現身於浙江路偷鷄橋之南，市屋相間之曠塲，幕天而席地：一桌，一椅，筆硯，書卷，本業所需之具，外無長物也。偷鷄橋，有求其雅而改書爲透機橋者，除示人以透露天機之佳朕，命相者業於斯。巧不可階也！此女相士，兼事批命，取酬。二小銀幣而已，中人以下力所能任，且其地盤接近十字街頭，故筆硯初安就之者如初！</p>
<p>余屢耳其術之騐，邇曾一往覘之：在人轅之核心。女相士踞坐其間，慷慨指陳，竪竪不絕。其人年事可三十餘，面有風塵之色。衣衫落拓，頗有名士風，其俛仰吐屬之間，全蠲免女子態。有問命者，輒書一紙歸之，揮毫迅疾，字跡豪放如其人。其言要而不煩，客輒微笑領之。據其自述，機關也，商店也，我時有廁身之會也，而仰顏看人，鮮不被目爲花瓶，恣人嘲弄者，取財而受委曲，我們樂爲之？吾業雖賤，流轉江湖，而交易則退，心安理得，自默多矣！人無一藝，而欲茍生於世，惟有任人之宰割耳！</p>
<p>吾退而思之，其人洞明世故，或曾從憂患中來，以能自食其力爲樂者：雖其工作未必有裨於世，而態度光明，女界中所罕觀，可敬也。其文墨之長，非其他女相士可及，猶餘車馬。樂而爲之記。</p>
<h3>蘆花白時</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>踏上啟鄉的提岸，又是蘆花白的時候了。</p>
<p>還沒有從記憶中的漏掉，去年這時候。托舅父一同在沙灘上捉過蟹。黃昏，大見亮的光給沿灘的蘆花鍍上銀白色，襯託在後面的是鳥于的江天，又是兩條黑影，打高堤上悄悄地橫下灘去，那瘦長的是自已，那矮胖的是舅父。</p>
<p>兩個人把褲管撩高，披開枯焦的蘆悍蘆葉，跑進深林里似的，舅父把手里的桅燈扭亮了。向有水的那方面照去，靜蹲著，那麼老練地，把長年患著的咳嗆也迸住。我是急性子的人，怎么還不見蟹上灘來啊？這問句老被舅父的眼色拒絕著。我是不慣這種捕蟹者的生活。</p>
<p>漸漸地有吱吱爪爪的聲音從水中帶上來，蟹羣是給桅燈的光明引誘上來了。</p>
<p>便又高興起來，從容地把爬近的蟹捉進寵去，當我捉住一雙小的時候，舅父便叫我仍扔到水里去，他說讓它養得大些，心兒里想：這亦不過是拖延牠生命罷了。早遲還不是蟹籠里的俘虜嗎！雷然，在一般捕蟹者的心目中，並不是要把小的蟹放生，不過爲著自已將來更大的實惠罷了。</p>
<p>還沒到黃昏，就捉到滿滿的一籠了。</p>
<p>便帶著充實的蟹寵和煤油已完的桅燈，踏著冷白的月光回去。自已走在舅父的前面，他不時反鄉下近年來紹續在傾廢的生活說給我聽。假使在鄉村都會變成蟹羣的，廣大的人民有時也會受到一些光明的欺騙。</p>
<p>舅父確實是受到這種欺騙而喪失了生命的。</p>
<p>現在，甚麼都還是一樣，高堤，淺灘，殘廢的季節的風吹白了蘆柴的頭。蟹在蘆花飄滿的水中又長大了，故鄉的景色是永遠不會使我忘記的。舅父的音容呢？沒有呵！站在故鄉的長堤上，悵望著雁陣向天風長鳴而過。</p>
<p>小常識</p>
<h3>談毒瓦斯</h3>
<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>自科學進步，近代內戰爭，與從前大不同了。尤其是化學戰爭中的毒瓦斯放射，說起來不寒而憟。常第一次歐洲大戰時，德軍曾經使用毒瓦斯以對抗聯軍，那時聯軍中中毒的有一萬五千名，其中五千人，皆不救而死，即經救治的人，也大半受毒的傷害，有殘廢的，也有永久變爲痼疾的。在人道上看起來實在殘酷之至。現在把毒瓦斯的起原與種類，分別說明如下——按毒瓦斯的起原，是一八七○年德國的一位藁劑師所創造○他說如在炸彈中，放了一種苦西耶密的藥，能夠減弱敵的戰門力，當時的學者，都不見信，其後大戰勃發，復經過四十餘年的研究，大有進步，德軍首先試用，不過當時送毒瓦斯到敵䧃時，是用打氣筒放射毒劑的，或由戰爭車衝到敵陣中發散，或混在彈丸中發射，或從飛機上散下，有後因飛機發達，空中毒瓦斯的攻擊，當然不堪設想，所以各國的防空演習，都注重於毒瓦斯的防護與救助，至於毒瓦斯及於生理上的作用，分爲五種，即一窒息劑二磨爛劑三催涙劑四噴嚔劑五中毒劑六臭毒劑等六種，但也有一毒瓦斯中，含有二種以上的性能的，一窒息劑的毒瓦斯，是用鹽素，臭素，覆司要狄覆司根等原料混合而成，倘若我們吸進這瓦斯，肺臓立刻起了水腫，不能呼吸，窒息而死。其鹽素爲黃緣色的透明瓦斯，放出後吸收了空氣中的溫氣，就變爲白色的濃霧，臭素爲赤褐色的瓦斯，但覆司根爲無色透明的瓦斯，是一種液體，一經放射，立即氣化，在攝氏八度，就變爲白霧，狄福司根，也是同樣，不過，稍帶青色。二靡爛劑的毒瓦斯，爲伊斐復德與路沙脫原料混合，有氣體與液體的分別，我們的皮膚，倘若觸了這毒瓦斯，那就立刻潰爛，差不多與硝鏹水的性相同，偌若吸進了這毒氣，輕則變肺炎，重則就死，德軍前在䧃中放射這毒瓦斯時，聯軍都棄槍倒地而死，後來聯軍中，有一位醫生發明解互的方法，就是用沙拉西粉以消毒，假使中毒後，把沙拉西粉，敷在身上，那吸進的毒，就從皮膚出血發散出來了。三催涙劑，觸了這類的毒瓦斯，立即要流涙，目不能視，這是美國警察平時用以追捕盜賊用的，其原料爲鹽化比克林，青吳化明齊爾，鹽化阿水德分膿等所混合，在戰塲中若是受了這毒氣，當然不能開眼，束手就捕了。四噴嚏劑，吸了這種毒瓦斯，咽喉非常腫痛，一面就變爲氣管支加答爾，發生劇烈的咳喇，因爲是狄灰尼爾鹽化素，狄灰尼爾青化素，　阿丹沙德，苦西米耶等混合的緣故，所以對於呼吸發生了極大的障礙。五中毒劑，道種毒瓦斯爲青酸與酸化炭毒所混合，若是觸了神經中樞，立刻麻痺，觸了血液，就要中毒而死，但是在定量以下，也不致傷身的。六粵毒劑，這是新近所發明的本年十月閏國開化學協會時，紐約猶愛司姆公司的凱德博士在馬賽邱支州工業研究所，研究費棄的反應時所發見，其特徹，假使吸進了少量的毒氣後，咳嗽很烈，若吸了濃厚的毒氣，肺臓立即碎裂，化學記號爲與福司根的性質相類，近來日俄形勢緊急，俄國努力研究化學兵器，本月曾派遺氣象觀測隊，在俄滿交界重要都市設立觀測所，研究開戰後使用毒瓦斯時，對於氣流的關係，同時連絡中東路沿綫各觀測所而爲航空的試騐，所以將來如果發生戰爭，全世界的人類，必遭不可思議的厄運啊。</p>

<p>最後十五分鐘</p>
<h3>優游驟告失敗</h3>
<p>結果二對五臘隊勝</p>
<p>下半時竟連失四球</p>
<p>西聯甲組賽中、本週較重要之一幕、厥爲優游對腦克斯、昨在逸園舉行、球賽進展行程、初尚平淡、繼漸緊張、末殊奇特、似非爲一般觀衆意料所及、結果腦克斯勝、優游失敗、比婁五對二、</p>
<h3>勝負焦點</h3>
<p>優游遭逢不少打門機過、占獲敵壘、似在反掌之間、奚巧生心與力遠、致有負使命之咎、否則多獲數球於前、後來即遇不幸、亦何致失敗於腦克斯手中、優游守門徐亭表演驚人、全塲贊許、江善敬漸見退化、不如王樹森之穩重可靠、三中衛綫、右防較弱、前鋒混亂、少有程序、但憑各個技術、分頭進展而已、腦隊之勝、非其球藝之高妙、實奮門精神之過人、</p>
<h3>聲勢浩大</h3>
<p>優游挾夙進軍、徘徊於腦門之前者良久、初無間隊可乘、一球忽自右來、敵方有事於邊區、中部空虛、奚巧生大可迎刃而解、乃誤以守者之身爲門、射中其身、領隊稍有振作、顧不久仍見優游前鋒之活躍、孫錦順任中鋒職、非其所長、而高射底蹴之猛烈、則無出其右、十分鐘時、孫氏曾主踢罰球、離門三十碼、急出如矢、要非略高一寸、屬中門柱、準進無疑、</p>
<h3>上半各一</h3>
<p>臘隊此球不負十氣大振、爭先恐後、李掌官邊防失守、敵翼斜入、江善敬抵抗不慎、乎觸球身、一聲十二碼、巴克執行無誤、首開紀錄、此後風浪迭見、均失時效、巧生連逢三次機會、卒以處置失當、未曾立功、乃於最後五分鐘時、順接鍾勇森林球、一關入門打成各一之勢、優游繼續遭遇奮險幸而徐亭機警、終上半時保持孫局、</p>
<h3>再度平手</h3>
<p>下半時接觸未久、徐亨又以敏捷身手、二次救險、博得不少掌聲、斯時孫氏改居左內、許文書任中鋒、陣綫變動之下、前鋒生氣勃然、和氏斜襄傳出、滾入陣中、許文硅少年英俊、心雄萬夫、一門在望、全力射去、笛聲隨起、正告成功、優游以二對一佔先、以爲勝利歸我無疑、事出意外、飽產利挾入陣、阿爾琪無人顧及、球忽光臨、阿爾琪迎之入門、徐亨孤掌難鳴、千辛萬苦、得來一球、轉眼即去、大非佳兆、</p>
<h3>敗在一旦</h3>
<p>果然最後十五分鐘內、風雲變色、臘隊似握有無上權威、橫加壓迫、優游域內、敵騎縱橫、雖分扼要區、難擋敵勢、初見鮑塞利單騎入營、繼由百勞特射入、末又被鮑塞利打中、優游連負三球、反覆之間、自勝利局面一變而成惡劣形勢、將士雖以死自誓、究無補於大局、結果臘隊五對二勝、</p>
<h3>優游隊</h3>
<p>徐亭　王樹森　江善敬　梁樹棠　陳鎮祥　李商官　符和萱　奚巧生　孫錦順　許文奎　鍾勇森</p>

<h3>最近改進專科以上學校之要點（一）</h3>
<p>十月二十四日敎育部商等敎育司長黃建中在中央廣播無紅電臺演講如下、</p>
<p>敎育部王部長上次講中國敎育現狀、已講過高等敎育現狀、今天所要講的乃敎育部最近改進專科以上學校的要點、專科以上學校、是研究高深學術、造就專門人才的、所以高等敎育也稱爲人才敎育、自訓政開始以來、一切建設事業正在進行、建設人才、自然感覺到迫切的需要、九一八以後、國防方需才尤亟、所以敎育部年來對於專科以上學校、銳意改進、以應圖家社會的需求、至於這幾年改進的結果、到底有沒有進步呢、進步究有多少呢、要答覆這兩個問題、不能不從質量上和數量上、加以詳細的觀察、不過質量和數量是互爲因果的、要改進質量、就要先盾數量的結果怎樣、必須依據數量的結果來改進質量、然後質景的改進、才不致於落空、同時質量改進的結果、也靠數量來權衡、否則質量改進到底有多少、還是不能精確的知道、現在先把全國專科以上學校的數量和分布狀況、向大家報告一下、</p>
<p>專科以上學校的數量、據數近調查、全國共有一百一十一校、較二十年度增加了八校、較二十一年度增加了七校、計國立藝衡專科學校一、省立農學院及工學院各一、私立醫學院一、女子醫學院一、工商學院一、女子文理學校一、以上七校除國立北平藝術專科學校、係應華北的需要而外、有五校是關於實科一校是關於女子敎育的、以設立性質來說、一百一十一校中、國立者二十八校（計專科十校、獨立學院五校、大學十三校、省立者三十二校）（專科十校、獨立學院十四校）大學八校、私立者五十一校、（專科九校、獨立學院二十二校、大學二十校）、國立省立合計爲六十校、較私立只多九校　、以學校的分布狀況來說、可分爲四大中心、在華北爲平津廿計二十校、在華南爲廣東共計八校、在華東爲京滬共計三十校、在華中爲川鄂豫湘共計十五校、其他各省、除熱河。黑龍江。綏遠。寗夏。青海。貴州。西康。西藏。蒙古等九省區、尚未有專科以上學校外、其餘多則七校、少則一校、所以現在全國專科以上學校的分布、華東居第一位、華北居華二位、華中居第三位、華南居第四位、不過這里要附帶說明的、就是大不客專科學校、若究全集中於一二都市、實在是不大合理、新成立的西北農林專科學校設在陜西、就是爲救濟這種流弊、以後仍當根據這個原則、以來學校分布的合理化、</p>
<p>照以上的學校數目看來、全國專科以上學校、在數量上、目前無積、極據充的必要、最緊要的、還是在質量上的改進、現在把秒近改進的要點、簡單的報告一下、</p>

<h3>從贛南新復匪區中之救護工作談到公家施診制（一）</h3>
<p>— 龐京周先生講　陳生白　江晦鳴筆記</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>十月二十三日，龐京周先生蒞校演講。承以贛南新復匪區中之救護工作狀況指示。聆悉之餘，深覺先生除詳述贛南之救護工作外，並益以題外雜感，與醫事設施之主張。其思想之超越，言論之透澈，目光之遠大，計劃之精密，足以發人深省。因特整稿發表，以供關心醫事者之參考。記者因時問忽促，兒不精速記，掛一漏萬，在所不免，是不得不向龐先生致歉！</p>
<p>按龐先生之赴贑，為受上海地方恊會之託。龐先生於診務百忙中，欣然就道。其熱心公益，造福斯民，益令後生致敬。</p>
<p>記者識於東南醫學院</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>這一次救護工作，雖然只限於贛南新復匪區：但以贛南的事情，同時可聯想到中國一般的醫藥問題。更以在其他各省考察所得，引起了鄉村醫藥與都市醫藥根本不同的概念。這是要特別向諸位提出討論的。</p>
<p>從上海出發到目的江西的廣昌，最足以使吾人注意的，就是第一在新復匪區，感覺到物質的缺乏。第二是民生凋敞，在該區所見到的，祗有軍隊和難民，到處是扶病流離的，是戰後的遣跡。當吾們一行人到廣昌的時候，因爲該地已距收復時期有三個月。繼過剿匪軍的整頓，以及新生活運動之努力實行，總算已恢復到相當的程度了。</p>
<p>當然，在這樣的地方，要談到醫藥問題，真所謂談何容易。雖是當匪區收復以後，地方善後和救濟的工作可以做起來，爲了當地開業醫師之缺如，救護機關的不充足，結果仍是使未病的無以防，已病者無以救——在南昌雖有紅十字會和江西全省衛生處，（屬全國經濟委員會衛生實騐處）因爲人材的不夠支配，尚不到廣昌服務。至於軍醫自已已經是忙不過來，當然他們也顧不到一般的救護工作。其他如省會的敎會醫院，那是高等病人的寓所，絕對不會想到救護工作的。</p>
<p>廣昌的難民有三千人以上，離廣昌附近七八十里，有難民約七千人，而有病的竟佔半數以上。並且在那邊收容難民的收容所，以是每相距數里一個一個的小收容所。試想以吾們有數之工作人員，去救護這樣多的病民，那豈不是一件難事。然而，所欣幸的我們由上海到廣昌去實施救護工作，共祗一星期，自問也就很快了。</p>
<p>我們救護　工作的實施，爲了當地物質供應的困難，只好取以下所說的方式</p>
<p>一設立施診所（因陋就簡，在一所破屋子里架木板做桌子的）</p>
<p>二柱難民收容所巡週視察。</p>
<p>三特別配置合劑作爲施藥。</p>
<p>這樣的方法，依科學醫的立塲嚴酷的來批評，似乎不十分合理。但依下面一件事情來衡律，那還是我們所深自慶幸而無愧於心的。</p>
<p>事情是怎樣的呢？在該區我們也曾看見過一般慈善家所佈施的十滴水及其他藥品。但是可憐，爲了一般民衆醫蘊智識的膚淺，和指示人才的缺乏，竟有把十滴水服景弄錯的。這樣的所謂慈善救濟，徒然給病輕的加重，病重的致死，諸如此類的事情，給在繁華都市高貴生活的人們看起來，也許要引爲笑柄吧。諸位。倘使你們身歷其境從匪區里或鄉村里得著一點閱歷的話，我相信你們一定會發生憐惜心的同情。我們的工作，以經濟的不充，人才太少和環境的不良，固然所用的救治方法，未免與理想中的科學醫相差尚遠。但是拿江西的情形來講，也可以說是實行醫藥並施的了。</p>
<p>至於救護工作的報告，據本人回滬後得來的消息，最近除掉醫治上設施外，更於每日抽出一二小時做預防疾患的工作。不過以少數的人員去應付每天三百多號的病人，難免要有點手忙腳亂的。</p>
<p>統計所經醫治的疾病，以皮膚科，小外科，痢疾，瘧疾，腳氣病，營養不良爲最多。消化器疾病也很多，神經系統疾病亦有之，眼科則比較最少。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>新復匪區的救護工作，既略述如上。其次爲盧到的題外雜錄。</p>
<p>（甲）江西的醫藥事業。</p>
<p>一紅十字會的不振作　江西的紅十字會，比較其他各省一樣的奄奄沒有生氣。據江西全省衛生處處長潘驥先生的談話，就可窺見一斑。當潘先生剛到江西視事的時候，爲了江西缺少比較大的房屋，與創辦時延用人才的困難，想到紅十字會里去商酌合作的辦法。於是他去走訪南昌紅十字會醫院的院長，商量合作的計劃，據那院長的答覆，只是自顧不暇，談不到什麼合作。因此，竟不得要領。在這里我們可以很清楚的認識，這紅十字會性質相同的事業，有振作的必要，特組織了一個恊勦會，湊些欵項，意在幫助蔣委員長勦除匪共，整飭後方，據說可以做救護工作。但在實際上，像救護工作真要出動的話，可是很難現，要先由省政府致函該會，經過該會開會議決，然後繼可以撥出欵項。由他們指定給紅十字會或其他醫藥人員，組織成隊，始能去作救護工作。但一面須由該會再函知官方，得到官方的同意，方可以照該會議案實行。其間手續的繁重，函牘紛披，像這樣紆迥遲綏，也祗有令人興遠水不能救近火之嘆。</p>
<p>二軍基的改進　江西在這清勦匪共的時期，大軍雲集，軍醫也就隨軍而衆多。蔣委員長因垂念官兵的疾苦，曾責令軍醫處處長盧致德加以整理後，已有相當的進步。盧先生現仿軍訓圖的辦法，把所有軍醫，每二三月一次，每次幾個人，輪迥舉行補習式的演講，來補充軍醫們的醫藥學識。同時他更親自巡迥視察所屬各區域的情形，一以釐訂個人辦事的方針，謀增加工作的效率。他從他的觀察所得，他主張醫藥要簡單合理化，甚而至於說。醫才不妨多級制。他說：要這樣，服務人才方可以增加，鄉村科學的醫藥，才可以普及。而且醫才多級制的實行，對於醫藥學研究工作上，也不會有什麼妨害。關於多級制的討論，常再爲敘述。揣想慮君的意思，實在已感受到十二分的人才缺乏而棘手了。</p>
<p>新近我在首都敎育部會議席上，晤及湘雅醫學院院長閏國人狄氏，他也很主張醫藥要簡單化，醫育要因地制宜，醫學課程標準要略有彈性的伸縮。</p>
<p>我們看兩氏所以有此主張，是由於多接觸鄉村和體察到中國一般情況的結果所致。至於有人以爲美國系的學者，往往過持高論，取新大陸爲法，足見也不盡然。總之，要認識了中國的國家，就發爲切中實際之論了。</p>
<h3>談病理原始動物（二）</h3>
<p>— 朱仰高</p>
<p>除掉了前面的二分法。可以把一個原蟲變成二個之外。會有於請芽生法。在線體上發出了一個幼芽。而漸漸的脫離母體及（二）多分法。就是一個母體。同時分裂至二個以上的原蟲數。在這二種方法繁殖的時候。核子的工作。亦與二分法的時候。大同小異。不過在多分的時候那核子多做幾次二分而已。但是原形質呢。往往要等到核子分好之後。按著幼核的數目。而分離的。致於他的分離的方法。是很簡單。好象一球普通植物的種子。到了成熟的時候。遇著一個小小的動機。就會爆裂的情形類乎的。</p>
<p>有些人或許要問著。這樣繁殖的幼蟲。再要等到甚麼時候。那主要的核子又想分裂了？又想繁殖了？那末。就非涉及生長的問題不可了不長大。當然不能分。但是同在一個原蟲體內的原形質與核子生長的速度。不是並行的。原形質首先的長得很快。往往要超過核子生長速度倍以上。原形質長到了適當的目的程度之後。那核子會是小小的一個。不過一到這個時期。那核子亦不肯示弱。驟然加足牠的生長速度一直要長到牠可以分裂爲止。</p>
<p>不但那原形質與核子的生長比較的情形如此。吾們竟然亦知道光光核子內的二種質地。（就是上面說過的運動的質地與傳性的質地）亦是如此。有生長速度不同的時候。有時傳性的質地已經長得很大運動的質地會是按著不動。連累到那整個見的核子。亦不能分裂。不算希奇。總之。一個原蟲的繁殖。亦與生長的工作帶著很大的關係。好比吾們人類也有年歲到了的人們尚未全部發育的情形一樣說了一大篇的原蟲有沒有雌性與雄性的的分別。這個思想。吾想有的人一定不少。原來那些原蟲的雌雄性。往往存一個體內。運動質是有人相信是雄性的。傳性質呢是雌性的。不過這一個理論。雖然亦有實騐的若干證據。但是事實方面。往往在幼原蟲的羣隊之中。另有可以特別我別的雌蟲與雄蟲。這些特種的產品。當然是與人類中不區我著同樣的喻例。但是在低級的動物中。以有類乎的現象。閒話且不必多</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>說。言歸正傳的說吾們的原蟲雌雄物。這二性的生長能力與速度。確與其他的幼蟲不同。普通是比較的來得慢些。當然既已存有雌雄的原蟲吾們就要問問。是否亦有受胎的現象。固然在原蟲方面。吾們可以看見三種的受胎方法。（一）接合生殖（暫時局接接合與核質交換。（二）愈合生殖（二個原蟲完全溶合起來。（三）自家接合在一個體內施行核子自分自合的現象。這第三種的受胎式。驟然看看。好像希奇。但是以上述的理論說來。每個原蟲的核質內已分著陰陽性的不同。那末在一個原蟲體內。也可以受胎。譜是當然可能的事體。可惜在人類中的雄雌人。不能亦有同樣的事實。</p>
<p>說了一套原蟲的繁殖與受胎的作用。吾們再回來看看原蟲的靜力學方面的構造。就是看看牠的身體如何能平均的浮寄在吾們的宇宙之中。原蟲中形如球狀的東西。欲是全用膠形物質而成的。那末。當然是在平均力學方面。毫無問題。牠可以在任何一個位置情形內。不發生若何不平均的現象。並且吾們知道。這膠形質的物體。亦可以在體內隨著必幫的動作而流動。隱隱然含著最高等的平均力學的工具。</p>
<h3>國魂與新生活運動</h3>
<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>耳目口鼻，四肢百體，人之所同具也，而其狀貌則人各異焉！操作好尚，舉止言語，人之所同具也，而其神情則人各異焉：何哉？不異則無別，無別則一人所特具之個性即無表現之可能，個性不能表現，則人之所以爲人者亦幾希矣！然則所謂個性者將恃何物以表現之乎？曰是物也，聽之無聲，視之無形，然而一人之聲容笑貌，舉止神態，無一不賴是物以表現之也。寄無聲於有聲之中，寓無形於有形之內，與生以俱來，與死以俱去，此何物乎？所謂靈魂是也。人既有之，國說宜然。</p>
<p>土地人民，服色制度，國之所同具也，而其大小多寡長短繁簡國各不同焉！政漢風俗，文化學術，國之所同具也，而其良窳厚薄高下深淺國各不同焉！何哉？不同行有別，有別斯足以表現一國之個性而無餘，而所以表現之者，則所謂國魂是也。國魂者寓於言語文化風俗制度之中，而所謂言語文化風俗制度者皆賴之以爲表現之工具，魂存則國存，魂亡則國亡，非獨國亡而已，其全民族皆將沉淪前刦不後之地位，如安南，如印度，其亡國也，亦並其靈魂而亡之，此所以俯首帖耳，永無反抗之思想，亦永無復興之機緣也。</p>
<p>吾中國立國於世界也，四千餘年矣！有其光榮之歷史焉！有其特殊之國性焉！故論其風俗，則禮義廉恥，人格之修養長深，語其文化，則儒墨老佛，學說之發輝益鉅，幫能特立於天地之間，而征服他種民族，如漢如唐，堪稱鼎盛，蓋其言語文字制度風俗，無一與他種民族相同，在在皆是以表現其特殊地位，故其國魂之發揚，互千載而不泯。此非吾一人之私言，稍讀歷史者，類能言之也。</p>
<p>吾國之亡於外族也，非一次矣，然而國亡而魂未亡也，何以言之？其言語文字，制度風俗未亡也，故不旋踵而復國，雖以滿清之玉主華夏三百餘載，而辛亥一役，崇朝之間，光復舊物，於以見國魂之不亡國之卒不至於亡也。自海禁大開以後，歐風東漸，吾人乃知吾國固有之文化不足以應付此朝夕萬變之潮流，於是而習外文，效外法，舉凡歐西東瀛之科學藝術兼取而研究之，然數十年以來，其果能得西方文化之精體乎？學術未如人也，政治未如人也，而吾國固有之文化道德乃日見其銷沉矣！國人之醉心於歐化者，乃無不革其履而一其服矣！刀叉其飮食而洋式其往宅矣！蟹行其文字而駚舌其語言矣！凡屬其於歐西之習慣者無不效之惟恐其不週，凡屬於吾國之固有者無不棄之惟恐其不至，所不足者未能高其鼻而碧其珠耳。使茍有術以高之碧之，吾知其更將自矜於人人之前也。鳴呼：所得者僅外人之皮毛，而所喪者實祖國之魂魄，以彼易此，孰得孰失，以明跟人之所以太息痛恨於其旁也。</p>
<p>謂中國爲已亡乎？則固有其獨立之政府獨立之土地人民在爲未亡乎？則四萬萬同胞中其能保存吾國固有之道德風度者僅少數而已，而一般自命爲智識階級者流，幾無不襲外人之皮毛而日趨於洋化矣！即以吾醫界論之，而此種情形爲尤著，一會之開也，無論其爲國際的與非國際的，而論文則必用外國文也。酬酢則必用外國語也，雖學術大同，不能持國界之見，而語言文字，究各不同，使並此不同之點而泯滅之無餘，則所以表現吾國之特點者果何在乎？然則中國之亡久矣！其未亡者僅其尤然之軀體而已！</p>
<p>吾觀人之病失魂也，其家屬之迷信者，往往焚香以祈之，狂呼以招之，以冀魂之復歸於本體也。然則國魂之失，將何術以招之乎？曰：新生活運動是矣！新生活運動者，以禮義廉恥之精神，寓於日常衣食住所之内，一方養成良好之人格，一方矯正奢糜之風氣，其關於教育者則有對於本國文字至少須識一千字之垂示，其挽頽風懲薄俗之意昭然若揭，嗚呼！舍此道也，則已亡之國魂將何術以招之乎？此則吾願國人之深醒者也。</p>
<h3>發熱普通治療法（五）</h3>
<p>— 李興</p>
<p>特別衛生</p>
<p>一口部衛生無病的人應當講究口部衛生。有病的人更應當講究口部衛生。口部照護的特別合於衛生，病人身體覺著爽快，胃口也可以轉佳。發熱病人常覺口多厚液，若不講究衛生，口中剩下的零碎食物，由細菌生殖腐化，一方面叫他覺著口臭，一方面，細菌如生的太多口之內外都可潰爛成瘡，這樣病人又加增了一層的痛苦。茲略述口部衛生於下：病人每飯後應當洗牙嗽口。普通用溫開無牙嗽口就算很好，若外加牙膏牙粉亦無不可。如口內覺著氣味特別不好，可用冷開水與雙養水配起，每樣各半，漱口洗牙。雙養水將口中腐化的東西完全養化除去，病者頓覺清爽。病人若特別軟弱或病勢沈重看護的人須代替他刷牙，幫助他嗽口。若病人口里痛不能用牙刷。裝有假牙齒塊的每飯後取下用水洗凈，吃東西時再放在口中。發熱時也應當特別注意唇嘴角。發熱人的嘴唇非常容易起水泡。嘴角也很容易崩破潰燭。用養化鏱藥膏，或礦油，或雪花膏類擦在嘴唇上嘴角，可免生水泡或嘴角。如果已經有了這些毛病擦這些油膏可保護皮膚使不再破爛，並且可以快快長好。假設口部衛生完全不講，病者口內外潰爛成瘡，飮食疼痛食物不能吃下將影響身體的營養，結果將減少身體的抵抗力。假設病未全愈口部又發炎成瘡，豈不是一波未平一波又起麼。故發熱病人不可不特別注意口部衛生。</p>
<h3>耳鼻喉眼衛生常識</h3>
<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（二十）腦漏的解釋（續前）</p>
<p>三急性前額竇炎Sinuitis　Frontalisacuta</p>
<p>急性前額竇炎單獨發生的時候很少。通常和急性節骨蜂窩炎同時發生。他的原因。和急性上顎竇炎的原因一樣。不過他所不同的地方。就是從齲齒的關係而發生的沒有啊。本病惟一的主要癥候。要算前額部的疼痛。這種産痛。在前額鼻粘膜腫脹。而竇內分泌物（膿汁）排泄被障礙的時候。最爲劇烈。此時病人的痛苦。最屬難堪。往往以爲這種前額痛。是普通的頭痛。常服止痛藥。希望止痛。然服藥後。大都大久又痛。終至不治。其實是由於急性前額竇炎的緣故。應當立刻囑托醫師。治療竇炎。方可根本止痛不發。此外病人時常感覺鼻閉塞。鼻汁過多，嗅覺障礙，羞明，流涙，眼窩內産痛，上眼臉和前額部的炎性浮腫等等癥候。鼻腔的粘膜。也是一般發赤腫脹。由鼻錢可以察見中鼻道的排膿。有時因爲前額鼻管粘膜的腫脹。以致通路閉銷。不得察見膿汁。這種由前額鼻管粘膜腫脹引起的排膿障礙。往往可以誘起骨壁的破壞。而成稍種的合併癥。最多而最容易破壞的骨后。第一當推眼窩的骨后。骨后一旦破裂。那就變成眼窩膿塲。此時眼臉腫脹。眼球突出，眼球運動障礙等等現象。亦隨之而起。其次要算顏面的骨后。就是先在前額部。發生膿瘍。後則變爲瘻孔。</p>
<p>本病往往可由適當的保存療法而治愈。就是靜臥牀上。內服發汗藥。局部施用冰素法。或溫等法。或照沙羅克司燈。或用電光頭浴。一方面由專科醫師。在中鼻道的附近。塗布藥液。使他容易排膿。如果疼痛劇烈。而有破壞骨壁危險的時候。那就應當施行根治手術。</p>
<h3>肺結核淺說（二十六）</h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>第八章　臨床檢查法</p>
<p>醫者在探問患者的時候，有一事也應該注意的，就是：患　者方面的口述，浮語當侭量避免，務使擇其尤要者述之。此中要領，醫者自應該一一指導的。但話雖如此說，有時確實是不易應付的：碰著缺乏醫學常識的病家，或無知的鄉愚，侭敢說上幾車子的話，在題目範國以內還是狠少的。這當然是醫者們愛莫能助的。但是讀者們應該曉得，既往癥的探問，於是醫者在診病時的初步手續；病者的目述！拿來作診察前一種參考固無不可，並不是句句當作信史的。像心瓣膜病發生的障礙性氣管枝炎，有時僅靠病者的口述，幾乎是和本癥完全一樣的。此中是非的最後判斷，醫者自不能不採用第二步技術上手續的，這就是上面所講過的診查工作了。</p>
<p>（二）物理的檢查從前舊醫們的診病方法，相傳有四字訣，呌做；望聞問切，這里面祗有一切字，係代表醫者診查工具的。拿來對付種種複雜的癥象，誰也知道是不夠的。新醫方面就不然了對於患者的現癥診查，除開本節物理以及Ｘ光的透視等種種，對於每種病癥診斷上的助力都是狠大的。關於肺結核癥的情形，當然也不外此例的。他在物理的檢查四種手續上，以打診聽診兩者爲最重要；我們不妨大膽說一句，就是：除心臓方面的疾病外，這兩種手續，幾乎是給本癥完全包辦似的。視診次之，觸診又次之。現在且將這幾種手續的解釋，以及在本癥方面的結果，一一群述於下：至於細菌和Ｘ光檢查等情形，都另詳在後面各節裏面。</p>

<h3>解嘲</h3>
<p>— 向隅</p>
<p>你如果有志做一個作家，你切不要去做一個雜誌的編者或副刋的編者。這將把你的希望，你的精力，你的時間，以及你的整個的生命，消耗於你所不喜歡，你所無興趣而你又不得不去做的無聊工作中。</p>
<p>在自然界中，你留心去觀察，即是一株小草，你也可以看出即的某幾條葉是特別肥長，一株樹木，牠的某幾條枝特別高昻，一帶樹林，牠的某幾枝樹特別長大；再你如遊名山，你覺得橫在你面前的一排山峯，某風個峰特別超㧞；你如仰觀天體，你也覺得某幾顆是特別輝耀，但你如果把你的眼光從自然界回轉來觀察你的同類中某種職業的人——那就是一天到晚在那兒弄方塊字或橫行字工作的編輯者——不問你是豎觀歷史上的人物，或是橫觀常代的人物，你曾見幾個幹這樣把戲的人高出儕輩，著成了幾部不朽的名作，給當代的人或後代的人欣賞的呢？</p>
<p>你也許對我這話表示異議。你可以舉出英國散文名家史提爾是的編者，他的文體像他的爲人一樣是可愛的，正如薩柯雷所說的一樣，他是我們的朋友：我們愛他像孩子們愛他們的對於一個Ａ字的愛一樣，因爲創可愛的。愛迪生是的編者，我們只要借約翰遜的幾句話：他曾反善恢復到牠應有的尊嚴，並且使人知道善應不以天真爲可恥。這是一種提高文學性質高過希臘羅馬的榮譽的工作。……不問誰要求達到一種明易的，但不粗俗的，幽雅的，但不雕琢的英文文體，應該日夜的研究愛迪遜的文集。我們就可以明白英國人的推崇愛迪遜。你也可以講，不但此也，即連我們讀文報捃華勞鳩爵士那樣的可笑人物，依然還能使我們這樣異邦的現代人感覺興趣。再你還可以舉出迭更斯最初也是個從事新聞事業的人，他們都留下了不少的名著給我們讀。還有，你也可以說，如我國的梁任公先最初也是從事新聞事業的人，雖則他的從事新聞事業的目的是在政治，他的後期著作，我們不要去講，他的初期作品——飮冰室文集——我們不問在思想上或者在文體上，多少受過他的影嚮的。這話自然我不否認，但除開這幾個人及其他少數幾個人外，其他無最數的新聞雜誌編者有些什麼作品可以流傳後世呢？</p>
<p>前幾個月我接到一份閏國活時代五月號，因爲這一月是該雜誌創刋九十年紀念，當中排入了許多歷來該雜誌所轉載的名人文章，如：一八六一年九月份曾載䣣東的論美國；一八四四年六月份曾載嘉萊爾的致青年書一八七七年一月份曾載羅斯金的致少女書；八六四年三月份迭更斯的薩柯靈論；一八七○年七月份曾載脫羅柏的迭更斯論等，而其歷任編者如以及現任編輯等，除開創辦人有一篇短短的陳套的卷頭語以外，其他的編者，皆沒有什麼著作可以提供作者的前面，這並不是講他們從來沒有寫文章，也不是講他們根本不能寫文章，這是講他們不是爲他們的雜務所糾繞，沒有空寫文章，即是他們所寫的文章，即是他們所寫的文章，至今已失去其時代的意義，與其相對的價值了。</p>
<p>我們道一個新聞雜誌的編者，是個事務人而不是寫作的人，他們反他所有的時間，都化在那審閱稿件的工作上，而這稱工作，正如沙漠中淘金者一樣，在無垠的沙堆中，淘中一粒金屑，不是容易的事，而編輯者在大堆的稿紙中找出一些好用的稿件也不是容易的事。這樣等到他一天的稿件審查完畢，他的身上已負荷著沉重的疲乏，他即是有寫作的才能與雄心，也無寫作的興致了，還談什麼寫作偉大的作品。</p>
<p>其次一個編輯者即是能寫作，他並不是興起而寫作，實在是爲他們的讀者的興趣而寫作。他不能寫他心中所喜歡寫的東西，他祗能寫他們讀者心中所喜歡的東西。因此一個編輯主要的任務是在撰擇那些現在流行的新鮮有剌激性的題材，以適合讀者的口胃。然而凡是流行的新鮮有剌激性的題材，都民只有時間性，而無永恒性的：凡是一般的讀物，都只宜有通俗性，而不宜有其特殊性的。換句話說，在編者方面是要向前進一步，而讀者方面，恰是要向後退一步，爲個人的特殊趣味，非退步不可。爲誰寫呢？爲一般人——這是新聞雜誌的本質！這樣就是有行殊的作品了。</p>
<p>第三我們知道古代敘拉庫札有一個呌傲德謨克力士一次在宴席上仰起頭來，看見一把劍用頭髪懸在他的頭上。祗要縣這劍的髪一斷，劍就會掉下來將他殺死，但德謨克士平常所希望　的王冠。畢竟是真的。而新聞雜誌編輯者現在歐洲幾個不自由的國家，畢竟都是無晚的，而劍卻不是麥克貝士腦中所幻想的劍。所以即是一個編輯新聞雜誌的人，他的思想，影諸文字，能有獅子一樣的吼聲，但走著牛也般的步伐的社會進步。卻是不相容的。因此即有足以推動人類前進的思想，但了環境所制限，終於不敢形諸筆墨，也不是沒有的。在這樣情形之下，所寫出的東西，自然是思想長平庸，最惡劣的東西。</p>
<p>因爲這樣，從壞的方面想，一個新聞雜誌的編者，真是浪費他的一生。就是從好的方面想，至多也不過造成一些波動的空氣，這種空氣，如要果牠變成一種推動牛也似步伐的社會猛進，還須其他的力量來做助力。一促新聞雜誌編者，如果在他將至生命完畢的時候，回顧他的過去的言論，曾有幾回能像靜止的水面下忽然翻上幾個泡沫，能使安靜的水面，稍爲波動，那就是他唯一的安慰了。</p>

<h3>發見一萬五千萬年前的恐龍骨</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>美國博物院辛克萊恐龍探索聞近在維沃明州大角山覓掘恐龍骨，共得類的恐龍骨十二副。這類動物，是恐龍時代重十五噸的兩棲爬蟲，牠軀體的龐大，從這重置，可以想見。該團現由大角山回紐約。據參加這次工作的阿丹森氏聲稱；從這些骨殖上，可以推知極古時代大約在一萬五千萬年前，曾遭大旱。當時四周的泉流，都已凋竭，大約只有大角山一處，還有未全涸的泉流，所以這些大爬蟲聚在一處，嘗牠們最後的飮料。更可驚奇的，當我們掘出這些大骨頭的時候，還掘得比較略小的動物骨殖。牠們連牙齒算，長不過三四吹，重量在五順上下，。牠們專吃大動物的血肉，猶如人類中的匪徒一般。牠們因爲貪食恐龍，跟著那兩棲動物羣來到大角山，不想同遇旱災，也死在水涸的洞中。恐龍是禽和爬蟲兩種合體的動物，牠們所吞的，大如柱石。該團今夏所覓得的古生物，有兩種確屬重要，一是一雙小恐龍，大如現代的火鷄，一是一種有像鴨嘴式的恐龍的頭。</p>
<p>美國博物院辛克萊恐龍探索團的團長白朗博士，現正考慮一種計畫，擬由天空探索恐龍。預定飛行約一萬二千喱，他們不沿已成立的航空綫飛行，將飛過芒太那州，南遠柯太州，柯洛拉杜州，鳥太州，維沃明州，阿里查那州，新墨西哥州的山嶺，沙漠，險惡的高原峽谷等地。白朗博士聲稱；我們當然不希望在空中看見恐龍的骨殖，但是各處的山脈，顏色和組合，各各不同，只有在空中才容易判分。一萬四千萬年前侏羅紀灰色石板海洋沉殿物，和大約一萬一千萬年前白惡紀褐色海洋沉澱物中間，有虹色的泥土帶，其中富有恐龍的骨殖。那是有史前海洋兩次大汜濫中間恐龍的游行地。飛行的目的，乃在跡得有化石的地層，那地層關由一百二十呎遼四百呎。從我們的經騐，知道在飛殿上區劇化石帶，比在地面要淮確得多。我們擬在鞌中攝政地形數百幀，用以辨明每區化石的性質，猶如醫士從Ｘ光照片辨明病癥一般。換一句話說，飛機和空中攝影器，現已在地質學上和古生物學上開闢一個新境界。</p>
<h3>孩子</h3>
<p>— 黛</p>
<p>結婚了五載，去年生了個孩子，是男的，朋友們都作一件事似的慶賀我，就是我們婚後一個月被帶離開的家庭，也破例來了封信，一說產婦保養法及孩子的扶養法等等。</p>
<p>在彌月的宴會上，我敬謝朋友們時說，我開始作牛馬了！</p>
<p>雖然四年來過的是同樣的生活。</p>
<p>但是孩子終究值得可貴的，今天新正里從家鄉來了封快信，要我帶著孩子回家，在我做頭的時候。</p>
<p>離別了五年的兒子將帶回來一個可愛的孫兒，對於娶媳婦的原則上似乎已滿足了他們的慾望，這個孩子我無如何要進貢般的帶回家一次的，在歸途的火車中，我想起了這幾年來的顛沛生活，對孩子說。你爲什麼不早些降臨到這世界上來呢？</p>
<p>我回上海的時候，他們想把孩子留在鄉下，但是他太愚笨了，見我穿了衣服要走，偎在我懷里不讓他娘抱去，終於還是一同出來；不知他知道否，在上海他將繼績我的牛馬生活的？</p>
<p>但是孩子終究值得可貴的，今年孩子週年的那天，他的祖母老遠的從鄉下出來，抱了他一整天才帶了個像片回去。我曾癡念我的祖母對於她的孫兒爲什麼不這樣敬呢？</p>
<p>這就是做人之道，孩子生下地來所以呱呱的哭。</p>
<p>孩子是早熟的，現在能夠做乎勢代表他要想說的話，據我奶媽說過，我小時候也這樣逗人可貴過的，我虔誠地希望他不要一貫的承繼我的命運！</p>
<p>前幾天抱他到百貨商店買套絨綫衣褲，走過玩具部，他呀呀地作乎勢了。櫃臺上最誘人注目的一個挺大的洋囡囡，孩子知這東西好玩，他噪羞要買，我查看牠標著的售價，是五元九角半，他恐怕忘了生下地來時是呱呱大的哭的。</p>
<p>你爲什麼不住在鄉下呢？我想，你祖母一定能夠實現你這個願望的！</p>
<p>他娘看不過去，買了一件小的玩具，但是他使勁的拌，回家來還是哭了許是時候，不想吃奶，不要娘抱，在床上打潦，把小玩具也摔到了床下去。</p>
<p>可惜他不能說話，我真想要他明白；孩子，還不過你的開始罷了，跟著你的爸爸是永遠不能使你快樂的，而況你根本是你祖母的孫兒哩！乖的罷，將來捧不著飯碗的時候再哭不遲！</p>
<p>那一天夜里，他不時哭醒回來，大概他做了那個洋囡囡的夢吧？</p>
<p>今天不知誰把那個小玩具從床底下檢出來，他一見就呱呱的大哭起來，孩子堅強的記憶又太像我，真不要承繼了我的命運？</p>
<p>我希望他能夠離開我，回到鄉下去，至少他能像我一樣度過短時期的兒童時代啊！</p>
<h3>斗方（四）</h3>
<p>— 爲何</p>
<p>父親的達到願望，事情完全是偶然的。聽說張老爺的佃斃，那年夏天因爲天旱，稻子都給囑焦了。因此在秋收的時候，大家都要求停付租稅，不論怎麼催也是無用。縣政府也曾經派警察下鄉，幫他催，把整串整串的他的一個姨太太又死了，更便他傷心。他決定在年底脫脫晦氣，把整座房子都加以刷新，舊的斗方對聯自然也需要一新面目。但一時找不到寫宇名手，逼近年關又不能不有點級，不得已，只得呌我寫一大批紙斗方，暫時貼一貼，等到開春再正式油漆。</p>
<p>老頭子的快活，我簡直是無法形容的。他一從張府回來，就吩咐我停止寫字，說是養養神養養神，養養神，此刻寫倦了，替張大爺家里寫的時候，就會沒勁呢……</p>
<p>爲了找好一點的斗方書，他特意上城去。那天雪下得很大，好像到處都在節麺粉似的，整儡天地似乎都變成磨坊了，看出去一片朦朧。西北風起勁的括，田野在激烈地發抖，沿路小溝里都充滿著凄涼，薄冰的碎裂的聲音。父親原來很怕冷，就是在家里的時候，也是一天範袖子，烘火鈢，像老貓似的。那天他卻冒著風雪，經過那樣修長艱苦的道路，上城去找斗方書，原因卻足是爲了討張老爺歡喜。看到那個僂瘦瘦的背部，那羣著傘柄的顫巍巍的乎，我不但感到憤慨與羞恥，也同時替他的愚蠢可憐。</p>
<p>他回來一部日用百科全書，里面是有對聯一類的，材料很多，他呌我自已選擇。</p>

<h3>從國際貿易上所見到的中國農業經濟</h3>
<p>— 余捷琼</p>
<p>中國以農立國，國內的經濟活動，固以農產品爲主；即國際貿易，亦以農產品之輸出爲大宗。我國的國民經濟，完全立足在國民的和事業之上。時至今日，都市中雖有若干新式工業的出現，而農業之爲國民經濟的柱石，依然如昔。</p>
<p>一般農業國的國際貿易，通常都是輸出農產品，換進工業品。自世界經濟恐慌以來，農產品價格的下降特甚，農業的吃虧最大，往日以某量之農產品換取某量之工業品，現在，則因農產品價格的跌下遠甚於工業品之故，某量的農產品已再不能換取昔日同量之工業品，而應多賠一筆虧折。因此數年來農業國的經濟恐慌，遠甚於工業國。我國是農業國之一，自然亦同樣吃到這筆大虧。所以我國年來農村的經濟恐慌，所受的國際經濟的影響是雙重的：一是國際經濟普遍的衰落，由國際貿易中誘導到中國來；一是農業經濟喪落的特殊狀況，亦由國際貿易中導入中國的農業經濟的領城。</p>
<p>幾年來中國農產的輸出貿易，不單受物價的影響，蒙無窮的損失，且在貿易量方面亦呈顯著的衰退。輸出量的衰退，可說是世界經濟普遍衰落的結果，物價低降中的損失，卻是世界農業特殊影響的結果，現在我們就這兩種事實，分析年來農業經濟衰落的狀況。</p>
<p>第一，我們先從量的方面觀察。年來因爲天災的不斷出現，匪區範圍的擴大無已，外侮作用範團的深入腹地，出口量可謂一落千丈。然匪區是在腹地，外侮威脇的亦是腹地，天災作用的區域亦是在腹地。所以農業所受的影響最甚，農產品出口的衰退，亦就特別利害。我們且看年來農產品輸出貿易的指數，可以明白年來農村經濟衰落的一般狀況。（社會經濟調查所編）</p>
<p>總指數一項概括種子及子餅類，有榖果及果仁類，煙草類庶類毛漲類等未列入各項。</p>
<p>在各項出口事業中，豆及豆產品衰落最甚。主要的原因自然是因爲東北失去，關外的出口類，實際已不入中國的關冊。至於本部的豆產，爲微微而又微，簡直不足提起。其次爲五榖及產品類。年喇只有洋米麥進口，未見有大量糧食輸出的事。農村雖然豐收，產量過剰，然在整個的世界市塲中，糧食太都是過剩的。因爲受世界價格和運輸工具限制的關係，農村中過剩的五榖運動通都大邑尚不可能。輸出外面自然更不必說了。所以年來農村中的收種雖然未週荒歡，然洋米珞之入口如故，輸出的襄退一落千丈，民國二十二年的指數已降到三十三點八六，今年礦著全國的大旱災，出口的極度襄退自在我人意中，滿一年的數字已經默示方向所趨了。再其次爲絲期。我團的絲業，已經山窮水盡，在日絲壓迫底下，眼見我國的絲業將全部破減。年來的出口，已一厥而不可復振，政府雖有相當的敎濟，人民雖咬緊牙關掙扎，無如巧逢世界市塲的普遍萎縮，碰落日本這樣一個當頭強敵，終歸是無法挽回江河日下的形勢。絲爲農村的重要副業之一，亦爲國民經濟的重要交往之一，昔年的絲品曾獨粉我國的出口事業，現在竟碰土這樣的惡運，影響之鉅，可不待言。再其次爲蛋類，年來亦呈顯著減退之勢。蛋類的出口占出口數額如許其高的比例，這已充分表現一般農民生活的清苦可憐。這幾年來農村的生活步步艱難，而蛋類的出口反見減少，這表明並非自已拿去消費，而別生活艱難，需要減少，一方是因國內災禍之區擴大，人民沒有安居樂業的機會；更有一個重要的原因，蛋價的狂跌，使農民養鷄的所得，不足以抵償生產的成本，於是只好收塲。這是年來蛋業衰落的原因。其他植物油類，茶葉類，棉花類，牲畜及肉類，其輸出指數雖有相當減退，然其狀況較爲良好，不至如何惡化。</p>
<p>總觀輸出的繼指數，可以看出民國二十一年是中國農村經濟轉變的一個總關鐽。民二十年六十五種出口物農產品，的總指數尚爲百零一點六一，民二十一年突降爲六十二點九九，民二十二年的情形更見江河日下，降爲四十六點零三，本年的第一季更爲惡化，總指數降爲二十六點四七。頹風不轉，前途實不堪設想，二十一年農產品出口貿易突然惡化的原因，並非一端所能解釋完盡。最主要的原因自然是東省領土的割裂，大量農產物的輸出額不入中國的關冊；其次爲對我們有密切的貿易關係的國家，都相繼放棄金本位，貶抑幣價，以貨幣政策堵塞我國農產出口之通路；第三爲我國最豐腴的區域所受天災的損害，民二十年的江淮大水，給與二十年的影響只在第四季，而餘波所及，二十一年經濟卻有重大的影響。再具他如社會動亂的加甚淞滬的戰事，均有影響於是年的出口事業。這許多原因，湊合起來在一年之內演出，遂開展爲二十一年農產品出口的大量減退。</p>
<p>農產物出口的減退，形成農村中貿易的不平不行了，農產品已經無法運出，或竟無物可以運出，而農民的生活，早以落在生存缐上，需要方面已經減無可減，再減了已經不能生存，農民在這種偏向的貿易狀況的壓迫之下，已經再沒有法子生存了。農村對內地城市的貿易的入超，把農村所有的微薄的現金都吸到城市里去；內地都市並不是生產的中心，牠的貨品是從通商口岸批發來的，牠報通商口岸的物品運入農村，並未將農產品運出口岸，或運出的數額甚微，不足以與運人的相抵，於是乎只好將自農村中收集來的現金運人通商口岸以爲抵償之計，這樣現金便集中在通商口岸了。但是，中國的通商口岸，亦不是民族工業所在的生產中心，而是舶來洋貨集散的樞紐。通商口岸的貨品，是絈來的進口貨。輸入的數額與輸出的數額懸殊千里，國際平衡的幾種工具如華僑匯欵與外人投資又都日就里退，於是而不得不運出現金以爲抵補了，即使一時不運出現金，亦應該把大量的現欵納入外灘的外國銀行了。這是中國內國貿易與及國際貿易關聯的公式。我們可以將這個公式，繪成下面的圖表：</p>
<p>農產輸出愈疲，貿易的倔態愈甚，現金愈集中都市，國際收支愈不能平衡，現銀流出，乃成萬不能遏阻之勢，而農村之恐慌與國民經濟的崩潰，亦成爲不能避免之事。這是從農產易的量的方面觀察。</p>
<p>其次，我們再就物價變動中觀察我國農業的狀況。</p>
<p>研究在國際間農產物與工業品價格下降不能恊調所給我們的虧，當從輸出物價與輸入物價入乎。我們的輸出，以農產品爲太宗，洋貨的輸入，卻以工業品居首要。所以輸入物價受工業品價格的伸降影響特大，而輸出物價，受農產品價格的支配特甚。由輸出輸入物價下降的不能平衡中，可以看出我們在實際收付中所呼的虧之大。輸出物價的下跌特甚，輸入物價的下跌卻甚有限，在國際貿易中，我們便應該以更多的農產品，始能換得同量的工業品，假如農民的收穫景不變，出口量也未見減少，我們在國際貿易中，依然難免於日見惡化，我們且看下面的指數（據國定稅兩委員會）（民國十五年爲一月）</p>
<p>由上面各項的比較，可知輸出物價總比輸入物價爲惡化。然就此尚不足以看出我們在國際收支中吃虧之巨。我們當再進一步觀察。輸出物品，實以原料一項爲主，爲輸入品則以生產品與消費品爲主，而著更確切一點的理解國民在國際實際收支中的吃虧，我們特別再將這三項的指數比較一下：</p>
<p>原料品輸出物價的指數，自十九年後，即逐日下降，絕無回漲的趨勢，且跌下的速率有按日遞增之勢；反之，生產品的輸入物價指數，二十年反見登峰造極，此後雖略呈衰退，然相差可謂無幾，消息品的輸入物價指數的跌落，雖較生產品爲甚，然猶不若原料品輸出物價跌落之惡化。</p>
<p>因爲輸出入物價下降的不能平衡，使我們在實際收付上吃了一筆大虧，直接影響農民的生計，縮小農民的購買能力，年來農村經濟的江河日下，所受物價不平衡下降的影響亦甚大。</p>
<p>上面從輸出量和輸出入物價，解釋年來農村經濟的所以惡化的由來。最後，在這里附帶提出一個挽救這種惡化的趨勢的辦法。</p>
<p>國際貿易似乎不能解決中國的經濟危機，我們要在國際貿易中取到有利的地位，似科是一件難乎其難的事。我們的經濟環境不如人，我們的人材技衡資本都不如人，任我們出盡九年中二虎之力，依然是不值人家一擊。因此，我人建議與其在國際貿易中作無希望的奮鬭，不良好條件的事業努力發展。各省的供求，完全取互助調濟的態度，以內國貿易我替國際貿易，以內國事業的互助互濟，減少國際間對們我的影響，這在前途上，或許更有希望可尋。非如此自已立定自已的基礎，邊早恐終不免爲國際經濟恐慌中的犠牲。</p>
<h3>從市集中所看到的中國農村破產的嚴重</h3>
<p>— 強毓</p>
<p>一緒言</p>
<p>在上海或南京的都市里，只要每天一亮，你耳朵里聽到的，眼睛里看到的，最顯明而觸目驚心的就是汽車邊並不是它開得快而欲壓死人的中外一律的危險可怕。卻是我們中國經濟上一個絕大危機的反映。因爲每一輛汽車的玻璃一直到機器，燃的汽油，行的車胎，一切的一切，無一件不是外國貨。禰汽車一項每天的耗費，已是可怕可驚。而坐汽車的人，男的則穿外國西裝，吃的外國大菜，吸的外國煙捲，女的則更是嚇人。年來的化裝品一門的進口上，已是值得人家回味，別的更不必說，完全是洋貨無疑了！</p>
<p>這個畸形發展的中國都市，是如此的表現著矛盾的瘋狂，而農村中究竟怎樣呢？</p>
<p>農材破產！上至坐汽車政府要人。下至靠勞力生活的小民，無不嘶喊著這個口號。而至於今日的中國農民。無不嘶喊著這個口號。而至於今日的中國農民。已入於民貧則治難的地步，大多數都是固貧而輕家，輕家而危鄉，危鄉而凌上犯禁；至於比較安分的農民所處的狀況，則都是因爲要投資於農塲，不得不借債；然而他們從勞動上生產的利潤，差不多全部都充作了借欵的利息，所以結果還是需要借債。祗是這樣的重複連環下去，已經很足以使得農人們的生活日趨於困難的境地，因此非借債不可的安分農民們，遂必須永久的擔負著這重如磐石一般的債務利息生活著。到了目前，更入於上氣不接下氣的狀態，而快將全部做利息奴隸的逃亡者了。</p>
<p>上面的都市與農村的浮面的對寫，雖然是不完全而膚淺的，卻已足相對的表現這老大的中國是向著末路上奔跑啊！</p>
<p>作者來鄒平好久，對於農民會作過一些比較客觀的考察，見他們吃的大多是自已生產的糧食，穿的大多是自已織的土布；表面上看來，是看不出要倚賴於外來生活物品的需要，好像和別的社會不發生別的經濟關係。然而在市集交換的組織上去一考察，卻發現了值得研究的中國農村經濟崩潰的問題。</p>
<p>我們知道中國的農村經濟制度，在道個現代工業的經濟統表，已受到了強烈的西方機械生產和資本組織的遙撼，把中國社會結構的基礎，失去了和諧與互適，將要推動了整個中國社會變遷，甚而要改換了整個中國社會文化的結構。</p>
<p>二。市集組織在生產社會中之史的考察</p>
<p>在人類生活的機構中，經濟是其主要的基礎。人類文化生活的模式，是建業在一個社會的經濟生產力和經濟結構之上。因爲有了農業生產方法和組織，人類的文化才能超出漁獵和遊牧生產的粗糙形式。因爲有了現代的機械生產和資本組織，西洋的社會才模塑出現代西洋的文化，去適應這新經濟生活。</p>
<p>市集這種農村中心的交換組織，在工業革命的前期，大概是一種模型的現象。在法國的星期五，是謂這字的前太半部分是就是出售或販賣的意思。是以星期五也就是出賣貨物的日子。在十二三世紀的英國倫敦，市集和廟會也是經濟交換活動的最主要的關鍵，那時即有所謂（星期白市集）也是用以供應地方上的日常需要的，其性質即等于中國農村中的市集。</p>
<p>這種農村臨時交換市塲——集——仍爲中國目前北方各省通行的普遍交易制度，農民到市集去買賣物品稱爲（趕集。在城市或較大的鎮店，都有設立，通常每五日一次，至於每一市集的交易活動範圍，即農民趕集面積的區域，大抵每平方面積十一二里到二十里之間。這樣可以適應農民的基本經濟需要，這可由一個市集共供給。</p>
<p>三。市集貨物來源的一瞥</p>
<p>在這小小的農民市集活動範圈內，我作了一次簡單而細心的考察後，在買和賣兩者之間，很顯然的看出了中國農村的所謂自給自足，已流向著崩潰的道十；工業生產的機製品，已衙破了農村自給自足的脆觸的壁壘。</p>
<p>本來在自給自足的經濟生活中，大部分的物品只是由鄰近的本地域去供給，但現在因受了生活奢侈的引誘而欲倚賴著工業社會生產品倚賴供給和幫補，發生了顯著的變化。</p>
<p>現在請先簡略敘述市集中買賣的貨物，就此現象中，再尋出一些中國農村經濟破產的根源。</p>
<p>市集所賣的重要食物，如米糕，面包，山薯，蔬菜，豬肉，掛面，鷄蛋，鷄，土布的鞋子，土布，大蔥，大蒜，柿子，梨，石榴，未製的棉花，以及另袋的糧食如商糧，榖子（小米子），玉蜀黍，綠豆，鮮活的魚和鎊蟹等等，其價值之估計，大概佔據百分之五十強，而這些東西的來源地，當然最遠也是一百里以內的。顯然的又可看出這些東西都是農民的剩餘生產物或農家副衆的生產，間或也有輪流到四周各市集去做小販的專業化的販子，總之，這些東西的來源，是出了不遠路的。其次的是香，䖶燭，籐貨，大車及牲口用的革貨，舊衣服，（日本衣服極多）洋鐵壼，牲口（牛馬騾等），菜種，木料，蘆藎蓆子，還有些洋襪，帶子，筆，墨，鏡子，煙葉，鹹魚，火柴，洋布，陶器，茶葉，錫箔，紙貨，等等。這些手工業品或機製品，以及少數的生貨，估計其價值約佔百分之二十五。不過是較遠的地域運來的，至手電，玩具，鐵器，化妝品如絲帶，雪花膏，粉，等以及洋油，顏料，樹膠鞋等等估計其價值，約佔百分之二十五，差不多全是外國貨。</p>
<p>由這些買賣物品上的大略觀察，前考約佔百分之十五十之一，百里以內的東西，在集市的全盤交換上，是不發生什麼影響的。就其所售的食物和小量的用品中，是專爲趕集的農民上集作暫時的飮喝或呼食的；小量的土布和土布鞋子，也不過備給沒有妻子的人或這一類的人買用。至於出賣的糧食也不過作爲農民偶然的交換，去嘗嘗別種糧食的口味的。至於第二者的香蠟燭，籐貨，大車及牲口用的革貨等，也不過是同較遠地方的特產交換，誠如嘉興的萇和杭州的茶或金華的火腿廣東的雲紗之類，是一樣的關係。其最童要的還是在第三者的自海外運來的洋貨（日貨最多），洋紗，香煙，之類的貨物。在這些貨物的交易上，如洋火，洋油，洋布等。差不多巴成爲每個農民不可缺的白用必需品或奢侈品了。</p>
<p>（註）估計之法，作者曾將勉集所舊的攤子數了一下，也大略問了一問每種的每價格子的全數貨物價值。再歸納起來，其答數即略如上述。至於要作精細的調查，一方面因人力和時間所限，一方面如果你去問每一個雉子的老圖，也是得不到精確的回答的，關於這點，作者曾連想到調查的問題上去。不是應當在此地說的話，不過附帶的提一提罷了。</p>
<p>四，結論</p>
<p>模據上面這個簡略的考察，再更潔的推測到近年來中國的對外貿易上，在國際市塲上的中國貨物，如棉花市塲之衰落，絲價之傾跌，茶之被擠軋，以及一切的中國產業的無出路；然進口製造品以供我國直接消費者及奢侈品，都提蒸蒸日上。在這種恐慌的形勢中，透澈一些的說，名之爲自給自足的中國農村的消費，四分之一的金錢，是要流到外國去的，豈不可伯？</p>
<p>再通觀上下，已明晰中國今日之地位，其病態已入膏肓，若已成了中國不治之癌。以如此龐大之國體，欲起死回去於一朝，良非易事：況經濟現象，內外錯綜，千緒萬端，治之之法，不能關閉，不能洞開，須切實察內在之背景，外合世界之潮流，俾能周詳縝密，方有出路。須知國際關係上之經濟連環，中國已成切不斷的一環。</p>
<p>末了，我還是要加一句：祗有內政和外交在完全健康的狀態下，國民的產業始有繁榮的可能。——（光明書局出版希特勒一四○面德國斯塔克敎授語）。一二十三，十，十一，于鄒平</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>墮胎罪</h3>
<p>— 鳳</p>
<p>前日立法院開會，討論到男子強奸罪與女子強奸罪，致枉費？各委許多的口舌，昨日討論墮胎罪，各委又大起舌戰，結果用了一種折衷辦法，其實亦未必盡符事實。</p>
<p>刑法條正案，第二八三條：一懷胎婦女服藥、或以他法墮胎者，處六月以下有期徒刑，拘役，或一百元以下罰金，二懷胎婦女，聽從他人墮胎者亦同。</p>
<p>凡父母之愛其子女，比任何人或任何東西爲寶貴，所謂愛的結晶我的肉，那有無端無肯墮胎之理，墮胎是出於不得已，或爲事實所不許，因出此危險而痛苦的下策，這是斷然無疑的，否則且愛護之不暇，邊論墮胎。</p>
<p>墮胎的原因，不外三種：一私生，二無力養育，三因病，試問三種原因，那一種有可以使他們不墮的理由，即使不墮，而生出來的胎兒，亦無非棄置路傍，或成爲一無敎育的游民，而增加父母的痛苦，不若墮胎之反爲乾安潔浄也。</p>
<p>並且照現在社會情形看來，三者之中，尤其是一二兩種爲最多數，而第三種到還甚少。既曰私生，在家庭方面，天然不能公開生育。不能公開生育，而又不準墮胎，不是爲家庭所擯棄，便是爲親族所不齒，如此非但胎兒不能保存，即胎母的人格和生命，亦或不保，是欲保全一命，而并殺兩命也，至於無力養育，而不準其墮胎，非但生產之後，無力贍養，即使養成，亦爲一無敎育之游民，不是做士匪便是做乞丐，不是做盜賊便是做游民，此種事情，無論爲胎兒著想，或爲貽母家庭著想，斷無處罰之理。</p>
<p>有某委謂，中國不患人多，只患少，此亦未必然也。中國外受帝國主義者經濟的侵略，內受農村的破產，和工商業的不景氣，以致土匪，盜賊，失業無聊之民，比比皆是，甚則爲溝壑之餓殍。而某委尚謂中國不患人多，而患人少，是某委僅見家庭中之情形，而未見社會之情形耶。</p>
<p>德國希特勒獎勵生殖，是有他的原因：一則自大戰之後，人民犠牲不少，至今未曾恢復，二則國家日漸強盛，須要增加國民，爲國效力，不患人多，只患人少，德國情形，確是如此，試問我國的國內情形如何。</p>
<p>墮胎的原因，以私生或無力養育者居多數，而因病者甚少，今爭議的結果，僅在該案另別表示婦女有疾病經醫診斷墮胎者不罰一條，此皆未能洞悉社會實情，而一以已意出之者也。並且此案之增加，似亦無謂。如不必經醫生證明，則無病可說有病，如須經醫生證明，則亦無非開醫生生財之道而已。夫立法貴重精神不貴形式，當深切體騐民間情形，不必高談法理和專打官話。</p>
<h3>父親死了</h3>
<p>— 小岑</p>
<p>父親是怕死的，是他終於死了。十幾年沉在病的氣氛中，他時刻都憂慮著自已要死，他用千銀給洋醫包診，請魔術家，拜神念佛，戒殺助捐，結果把病源醫糊塗了，成了一種似心理非心理的不可捉摸的奇癥，別人都說他太怕死了。他不能專心信賴一定的醫生才會弄到今天的田地。</p>
<p>但不，我並不以爲父親是怕死，他負責了。社會的現實告訴了他，他死了以後，他的妻子和一羣未能成立的兒女是將給社會毀滅的。雖然，他曾經化費金錢去使他的弟弟做官，可是俗語說得好：做官做得清，荷包又零丁加以時局多變，運動費化了，官到底是做不成的。他曾經化費了金錢去使他的兒子從大學堂的門口戴了四方帽子跑出來，可是商人告訴他：要來本公司任事要有千銀的保證金。跑到敎育的圈子里去，又聽說學生額數減少，敎員減薪，他曾經敎他的女兒嫁給萬金的巨子，誰知道她讀了書受了新空氣的影響，她要講自由變愛，和窮小子去過活。父親雖是個舊人物，然對於社會的一般情形尚能理解，他也就很體京他的兒女輩，因此對於自已的死，看得非常重大。父親的怕死，例如我們怕死亡的意義一樣戰並不覺得他怕是不恥的事，而是頗值得稱頌的一點。</p>
<p>父親在生的時候，他要我比我愛他還要多，自少他就就不看我是個女兒，他發覺我與平常的女孩的兩樣，所以在我懇求之下，他都負責我的敎育費，不像對其他的姊妹一樣，至多是讓她們讀完高小學校而已，這也不是他的偏重，在他有限的經濟力量之下，他是不得不這樣辦。</p>
<p>但是父親終於死了，當他掙扎著最後的氣息的時候，他忽然喊出了久別著他的女兒的名字，母親也正給他的呼聲感動了，她捧著一碗希望的湯藥立在旁邊，她受習習俗的指示，知道這是不吉之兆，她的眼涙就掉下碗中，呆了一會，她說：快！敎五叔去打個電報吧！睡在溫軟的床上，夢在車聲隆隆的上海的我，給敲門的聲音驚醒了，父死速回！告訴我父親不復與我相見了。</p>
<h3>吃飯小品</h3>
<p>— 烈火</p>
<p>晚餐過後，跟幾個頗合脾胃的同事圈起來談天談地，漫無忌諱的正談得出神的當兒，廚房的伙計幕地里銜進門來，他的住務一是來據，其次就是問我們明早要不要送兩客包子來試試口味他說包子里肉汁很多，味道既鮮，價錢又巧，試試就知道的。甲君答應了他送一客來試試看，乙君又還添上一客，伙計正得意的笑著眼縫成了直綫，我卻說包子里挽的都是豬頭肉，毛叢叢的，他聽了老不高興，不問下落，一個翻身就退出去了。</p>
<p>於是我們的談鋒，轉到了吃飯上頭，但並非正正經經談的什麼吃飯問題，也爲的是我們這一羣吃飯總算暫時解決，雖不能怎樣考究。</p>
<p>第一個接著談起來的是我自已。我們的家鄉每天吃三頓乾飯，早起的一頓在七點至八點之間，爲著燒飯的費時，還記得，先母在世時，每天總是雞呌三遍，天還不曾大亮，就下床去燒水淘米，到七點多吃好飯，大家就分頭去做事。中餐和早養一樣。晚餐來得隨便一些，五六月各米艱貴，往往還降爲僅僅吃點稀飯。</p>
<p>甲君說：我們的家鄉也是這樣的，所不同的是晚上家家都是吃稀飯，理由是晚上不做事了，用不著豐食。</p>
<p>乙君卻說同，我們家鄉的一樣，晚餐也仍是吃乾飯。</p>
<p>至此，我們又轉了都會里的吃飯上頭。</p>
<p>都會越發達越大，日和夜的時間就越顛倒錯亂。像上海，一個上午是對調半個以上的晚上的。一般的說，商墾要九時才開市，晚上卻要到十二點鐘敲過才默市，多少人，都是上午時倒在床，晚上卻達旦的活躍不惓。這樣，吃飯也就隨之顛倒了，通常的人早起只吃點稀飯，有些甚至根本不吃，一起床就中飯便了，而晚上的一餐卻總是吃得得別豐滿的，時問也延到七八時以後。這是一個都會之所以爲都會的最好的說明，也是都會與鄉村的生活形態不同的根本所在。</p>

<h3>來福嫂</h3>
<p>— 晶</p>
<p>趙三小子的　　出了大地主景環保沈明清的　，　然地　　製得連學步的氣力部沒有了，她那　　顛　著的瘦削的身體，差不多要在沈地保的門檻旁邊倒下去，青銅色的臉越發蒼白得令人可怕，珠也似的眼涙，汪汪地淌潟到堆浮著縐痕的嘴角里。</p>
<p>來福嫂，沈地保肯做點情面嗎？唉，這個年頭，做人真有點難！像勤儉守分的三小子，也還有人說他做出不安本分的事情囉。灰著兩鬢的長新大叔，站在他的茅屋籚下剝去剛掘出來的野茡薺的泥土，睢見趙三小子的娘從沈家出來，湊上前前去詢問著。實在地，他覺得三小子這次太冤枉了，他望望三小子的娘的瘦削蒼白的臉，望望一點浮雲也滑的蔚藍的天，這樣地發出無可如何的嘆息來。</p>
<p>長新大叔，可不是嗎，像三小子……來福嫂忍不住呼呼地哭起來，潮般的涙水，把前襟都濕透了。大大爹說他太不守本分了，這次四鄉的暴動，都是他鼓動領頭的，這事情太大，再也不能保釋出來。……長新大叔，你是知道的，這真是太冤枉三小子了，他何嘗有去四鄉鼓動，領什麼鬼頭，暴什麼鬼動呢？來福嫂把那雙戰籟策浮現著蚯蚓般大的青筋的枯手，掩住銅青色的臉，小孩子似的哇哇地哭著，聲音也都嘶啞了</p>
<p>前些時，縣里特派些什麼委員到村里和沈大爹一同來勘災，定成色，這是你大叔也知道的。我們的田，委實是被定得太高了，因此，三小子就有點不服氣，說要到沈大爹的面前去理論。你想，我們那里有什麼情理去和有錢有勢的沈大爹理論呢？也許三小子孩子氣得罪了沈大爹。說來真湊了巧，過了不久，四鄉暴動起來，三小子就平地地受了冤屈，沈大爹硬板板地說他是這次暴動的領頭。其實，那夜村里鑼聲大振，才把三小子從夢中驚醒，睡眼矇朧地坐起來，還以爲是鄉里發生了刦盜哩！長新大叔，你是明明人…來福嫂悲切地似乎找出了這次沈地保對三小子的誤會底理由來，一五十十地對長新大叔訴出來。</p>
<p>你還是趕快地到鎮上去，請求趙仁炳太爺去和沈大爹說情，也許他們交情厚，能夠看他的面子把三小子釋出來也說不定，除了這條路之外，那恐怕……</p>
<p>我昨天已去過三四趟了，可是，每次都見不到他的面，最後連大門都不肯讓我進去了。……來福嫂說到這里，已有占憤憤了，眼前覺得她的三小子的生命已是絕望了蓬亂的頭兒像樹枝兒似的低垂著。</p>
<p>長新大叔也想不出其他的法子了，默默地對著可憐的來福嫂搖曳著灰色的腦袋。</p>
<h3>離愁</h3>
<p>— 拓人</p>
<p>夜里的皇后磅頭上，高個子的印度巡捕，也好似感到了寂寞的站在那欄千邊沉默著。夜的靜寞的空氣，佔有這整個碼頭。</p>
<p>秋風吹著路邊的樹業，一片片的黃葉，在日熱的燈光下諷飛著，雖然清道夫不　　在掃下出，剎那閘，馬路上又都佈滿著那些離開了母枝的枯黃的落葉了。呵！到底秋風已經是吹到了這美魔的南島了。在這熱鬧的島市上，是到處散佈著秋天的景色呀！</p>
<p>明：別走這末快吧。你看看這些銅像，他們這樣孤獨的站著，多末可憐呀！</p>
<p>和惠走過了法院的門口，惠好似有所感的拉著我的臂指著那幾個孤立在草地上的銅像笑著說。</p>
<p>你別看他們可憐吧，這美賤的海島，還不是他們給祖國從我們的地圖上括去的嗎？人的孤獨比銅像還要可憐呢。</p>
<p>惠沉默著了，她你頭緊拉我的手向前走著，從這里離皇后碼頭，已是很近了，轉過了幾個灣，我們就到了這寂靜的碼頭了。</p>
<p>剛一走進了頭碼，那高個子的印度巡捕，好似發現了什麼似的，擺出那一副可怕的眼睛，不住的向我們身上睢，好似要從我們的身上找尋什麼似的可怕。惠心里有點怕的緊靠著我，低聲的問著：他做什麼呀！這樣的可怕的看著。惠剛說定這話，那印度巡捕卻自然的笑著了。我也看著惠笑了。</p>
<p>海邊，只是一片靜寂，那來往對岸的小火輪，也似疲倦了的在呌出低微的聲音，海波平靜地，一片濃厚的藍黑色，星兒在海中跳躍著，月亮模糊的藏在那白雲里，惠那紅潤的臉，在模糊的月光下，是顯得放外的可愛了，可是她那沉愁的眼睛只是望著那天上的流雲，默默地撫摸著她那亮黑的頭髪。</p>
<p>明：到了明天，我們就只好……</p>
<p>她突然的緊握著我的手，飽含著水的，眼睛也直望著我的臉，似乎有很多話說地。但她卻咽住的只是望著我，呆呆地像失去了什麼的在追憶著。</p>
<p>惠，別這樣的呆住著，停住在海中的那船，雖然明天要把我運走了，但是牠也會運我歸來的啊！</p>
<p>惠終於是沉默著，她很不自然的露出了笑容，但她的心，是在狂烈的跳動著，她望一望那船，又低下頭去撫著她自已的衣角了。</p>
<p>明：好吧，明天你勇敢的去吧！你是爲著你的事業，我祝福你，我希望你有一天平安的帶著了北國的愉快回來，我還在這里等著你。</p>
<p>惠雖鼓足了勇氣說出話來，但她那黑溜溜地眼睛中已經是濕透了涙水了，在這一個的晚上，我終於和惠離開了，一直的已經是五年了。</p>
<h3>康納馨</h3>
<p>— 櫻櫻</p>
<p>賽利蒂花舖子的玻璃櫉窗里。</p>
<p>嫩紅的康納馨，鮮豔得宛似待嫁的少女底臉頰。青春底驕傲在她的嘴巴下角里透露出來一朶微美的花朶！</p>
<p>賽利蒂花舖子的玻璃櫥窗的門外高級的平沿地石上。</p>
<p>移動過來四個尖銳化的皮鞋足尖！從二個更尖小的皮鞋蓋上面罩下來似嫩紅康納馨花朶顏色的衣角邊，可以連想到上面衣裳該是怎麼同樣的顏色來的！</p>
<p>嫩紅的平臂衣袖，濫灑的掛勾在深黑紅的手灣衣袖里，滿像是根漂亮的手杖似地。</p>
<p>回轉過細髪的頭髪，有一個康納馨同樣春青底驕傲凝結的微美的嘴巴！</p>
<p>—不美麗嗎！</p>
<p>—親的，輞買一個這個回去吧？</p>
<p>腳尖踱過來，碰著玻璃櫉窗前面的地石上。</p>
<p>纖秀的手指，粗壯的手指，同時間向里面點了一下！</p>
<p>（康納馨悲哀吶，什麼似的！—每次，每次，纖秀的手指，或是粗壯的手指，在自已身子前面這麼盤旋了不走開去，準就把自已的命要了去！</p>
<p>那個女人不夠美麗嗎？爲什麼美麗的女人亦是那樣不肯放鬆同樣命運的人們幫襯她更美麗的責任哩？</p>
<p>看樣兒，準是待嫁的青春底姑娘哩！不然爲什麼那個嘴唇要包藏下這麼許多不能吞吐的話來哩？</p>
<p>那個姑娘，爲什麼樣不悲哀哩？瞬眼間將是失去有青春底驕傲權的女人吶！你看：張著這嗎誘人的牙齒笑！</p>
<p>但是，小姐我希望妳能發些慈悲，不把我也帶在內！縱然，妳有不快活的幸福在眼前，不過，妳知道我曾爲妳頌禱替解除的——但是沒辦法哪，因爲這還是妳自已甘願的事情哪。）</p>
<p>—買這，你看，多美麗的康納馨哩！</p>
<p>男的摸錢吶。老板更殷勤的開著櫉窗。</p>
<p>（沒法躱避的命運，始終該遭刦無疑的。</p>
<p>康納馨的悲哀，什麼似的，流涙吶！</p>
<p>美麗的姑娘，同樣有一天，我約的青春會同歸於盡的）</p>
<p>美麗的康納馨，緊貼住姑娘的胸前啦：緊緊地，</p>

<h3>六百元的借據</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我有一個很要好的朋友，他在外面虧欠了很多的債，對於家庭方面，無法交賬，在爲我在他家里來往很密切，我的字跡他的家庭方面都認識，於是，他就再三懇求我，請我寫一張借據給他，假說我借了他六百塊錢，他好拿回家去交代。我因爲友誼的關係，不忍拒絕，就依他的意思寫了一張借據給他。在借據上寫了兩個朋友的名字，算是見證人和中人，但這兩個朋友並曉得這回事，所以也沒有簽字在上面。現在這張借據他已拿回交賬去了，我是無法討回，假使要他另寫一張字據，證明那張借據是假的，那又未免太表示不信任也了。不過我現在又想到朋友間的感情不能說是永遠不會變化的，一旦我們發生齟齬的時候，他會不會拿這張借據向史討錢呢？那時我難道就負償蓮的義務嗎？或者還可以設法不不認，去請求法律救濟嗎？這些問題，請你費點時間，在報上替我解答一下吧。敬祝</p>
<p>撰安　　張庸上</p>
<p>編者按：張君對於朋友似乎太忠實了。雖然一個應該去幫助朋友解決困難，但也應該考慮是種什麼情形。張君在寫字據的時候，先要知道這位朋友所虧欠的錢，是不是由於正當的用處，假使他是因爲不正當的用處而虧欠，那末代他寫這種借據就成了助紂爲虐，就是一種錯誤。現在二人雖然要好。但假使有一天發生裂痕，那末張君就有依照字據，償還債務的危險了。此事在理論上說，張君可不負責任，但恐涉訟起來，就難辨別了。根據所言之性質，如從人事補救，只有即速取回字據，或呌他另寫一張字據給你，說明這個情形，最好要有人簽字證明。這樣對於友誼是無損的，因爲這並不是不信任你的友人，實在是不信任友人的家庭，恐怕他家庭方面，隨時拿那六百元的借據，向張君要錢啊。</p>

<h3>端納談贛匪年內決可結束</h3>
<p>Peiping: Wang Chonghui, at 4:00 PM today, responded to Chiang's invitation to visit Xiehe Hospital. Because Chiang was undergoing a physical examination, the conversation was brief, and he excused himself. Yuan Liang held a banquet at the Yihe Garden Yijingfu Pavilion in honor of Yang Yongtai and Chiang's staff, with many important figures from the military and political circles invited to attend. (28th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Peiping: Zhao Daiwen arrived in Peiping this morning from Taiyuan, staying at the Yangdongcheng Guest House. He will soon visit Chiang to convey greetings on behalf of Yan Xishan. (28th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Peiping: Zhao Daiwen said that Chiang summoned him to Peiping soon after arriving, seeking his counsel. He traveled to Peiping at top speed to be available for consultation and to report on everything. Yan Xishan has recovered from his illness and is in good spirits, resting quietly in the riverside village. The Datong-Puzhou Railway has been repaired past Jiexiu, and it is expected that the entire line will be open to traffic next year. The postponed notification of the Fifth National Congress has arrived in Taiyuan, and Shanxi Province has no proposals for the Congress. He will return to Taiyuan after visiting Chiang in Peiping. (28th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Peiping: Military Council members Wan Fulin, Bao Yulin, Rong Zhen, Shang Zhen, and others hosted a banquet at the Jurentang tonight in honor of Chairman Chiang, Yang Yongtai, and Chiang's staff and secretaries. Chiang did not attend due to his physical examination. Since Chiang's arrival in Peiping, many people from all walks of life and various organizations have sought to pay their respects, but Chiang has not received them due to his physical examination. Huang Fu plans to introduce Chiang to various sectors on the second day of next month, after Chiang completes his examination. (28th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Peiping: Soong Mei-ling, Chiang's wife, stated that she and Chairman Chiang were undergoing their five-year physical examination at Xiehe Hospital, but the procedure has not yet been completed, and the date of their return to the south is uncertain. She came to Peiping once before the September 18th Incident. This time, she feels that the city has made great progress, especially in terms of hygiene and cleanliness. The banditry in Jiangxi will definitely be eradicated by the end of the year. (28th Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Peiping: Chiang's advisor, Donald, stated that the military suppression of bandits in Jiangxi has achieved a great victory and will definitely be concluded by the end of the year. In the past, the people of Jiangxi Province suffered from the oppression of corruption on one hand and the intimidation of the communists on the other, so some were forced to join the communists. Since Chairman Chiang changed his strategy and implemented a political suppression policy, our officers and soldiers have done their best to serve the people, abolish harsh taxes, eliminate corruption, build roads, establish factories, and schools. Everything that benefits the people is vigorously promoted, and everything that harms the people is severely punished. Under Chairman Chiang's leadership, this movement is actively progressing. As a result, the people in the bandit areas believe that the government benefits the people and the Red bandits harm the people, so they assist the government and fight against the communist bandits. Therefore, progress is very rapid, and the claim that it will be concluded by the end of the year is definitely reliable. (28th Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Peiping: The Peiping Municipal Party Department has scheduled an enlarged memorial week gathering at 9:00 AM on the 29th, originally inviting Chairman Chiang to attend and give a speech. It is now heard that Chiang is undergoing a physical examination and will be unable to attend. (28th Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

Although the banditry on the border of Guangdong Province has not been completely eliminated, the government army has the upper hand and can control everything, so the bandits feel very shocked. (28th Day Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Guangzhou: Official sources said that a fierce battle occurred on the border between Guangdong and Jiangxi today. The communist bandits planned to break through the government army's front line from Dageng to Nanxiong, but they failed and retreated to Datang, abandoning 800 corpses and many firearms.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Thoughts on Reading the New Life Movement's Methods for Reforming Customs</h3>
<p>The New Life Movement Promotion Association of this city is currently drafting methods for reforming customs. There are relevant regulations for major events such as weddings, funerals, and birthday banquets, in order to reduce the extravagant and luxurious customs of society. The intention is very good. The original purpose of weddings and funerals is to fulfill etiquette. Anything beyond this is nothing more than showing off wealth and seeking praise. In reality, it can only be described as frivolous. For wealthy families, taking advantage of the occasion does not harm their economy. However, those with limited means are controlled by this custom and emulate each other, which not only directly affects their personal economy and career but also indirectly affects the welfare of society and the country.</p>
<p>Our country today is facing external pressure from powerful neighbors and internal difficulties due to the bankruptcy of the national economy. The national situation is critical and we cannot afford to be complacent. At this time, it is essential that all citizens be diligent and self-reliant, reject vanity, and engage in production, invention, research, and cultural construction in order to save the nation. However, if the extravagant and superficial customs of society are not eliminated, it will be difficult for individuals to be diligent and self-reliant and strive for progress. The hope of our country lies in the youth. Now, the majority of the frivolous young men, and even those who are considered outstanding, aspire to obtain a good position in the political or business world with a high salary. Very few are willing to dedicate their lives to scientific invention and production construction. Where does this phenomenon come from? Is it not caused by excessive vanity? If young people are like this, how can we prevent the entire nation from pursuing wealth and power?</p>
<p>The reason why Western civilization surpasses us, though there are many reasons, is largely due to the fact that Westerners are not as concerned with personal gain as we Chinese. Their concept of a great personality often emphasizes scientists and inventors. When we read the history of science or invention in Europe, we see that many of the great scientists and inventors of the past were poor and frustrated during their lifetimes. However, because their ambition was to research and invent, they were content with poverty and hardship and did not seek anything else. If they were concerned with worldly vanity and wealth, how could they have succeeded?</p>
<p>The regulations drafted by the New Life Movement Promotion Association are good, but it seems that the means of strict implementation have not been considered, which is regrettable. Having rules without a way to implement them is no different from having no rules at all. In my humble opinion, this matter must start with the upper class, and political leaders must set an example. As the saying goes, "What the superiors like, the inferiors will be even more fond of." The same idea applies here. Taking frugality as an example, the lower class is already as frugal as possible. If the upper class can take the lead in advocating frugality, the middle class will naturally follow suit, and they can be encouraged without punishment. I believe that frugality is a virtue, and the nobility's ability to practice frugality will be of even greater benefit. If they truly wish to enhance their reputation and show off their wealth, they can use their money for proper purposes, such as donating to provide free education for poor students or building public libraries, hospitals, and academies of science. For the implementation of the above measures, we can form a persuasion group with appropriate powers to promote them. As for the detailed measures, we look forward to the careful planning of those engaged in the New Life Movement.</p>
<h3>Yu Xuezhong Returned to Peiping</h3>
<p>Peiping: Yu Xuezhong went south in response to Zhang Xueliang's telegram, and after completing his visit, he returned north from Hankou the night before last and will arrive in Peiping tonight. (28th Day Special Dispatch)</p>

It is still undecided whether he will rush to preside over the closing ceremony of the administrative meeting. Regarding the military suppression of bandits in the three provinces, it is going very smoothly. The remaining bandits in the border areas have intentions to go east to the Taihu area of Anhui. He will stay in Peiping for a few days before returning to Tianjin to manage the provincial affairs. (28th Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Jiangxi Construction Department</p>
<h3>Proposed Disaster Prevention Measures</h3>
<p>Nanchang: In order to prevent flood and drought disasters, the Jiangxi Construction Department has proposed implementation measures for prevention and has submitted them to the provincial government for review. 1. For existing forests and barren mountains and open areas, it is proposed to formulate restrictive agreements, implement joint protection, establish nurseries for raising seedlings, and jointly afforest. 2. Each county should delineate planting and harvesting areas in areas with large barren mountain areas, and all other areas should be prohibited from livestock grazing, hunting, and harvesting. Setting fire to mountains will be regarded as the same crime as arson. 3. Complete the survey of barren mountains within a time limit. 4. Supervise local areas to repair dams, sluices, culverts, lakes, ponds, streams, and canals to benefit water conservancy. 5. For every ten acres of farmland in high-lying areas, a pond should be built. 6. In areas with flat terrain suitable for machine water extraction, new water extraction machines should be purchased.

<p>Bangkok Strictly Investigating Telecommunications</p>
<h3>Plots for Another Coup D'état are Brewing</h3>
<p>The Current Government Deprived the King of His Power</p>
<p>The King Expressed His Intention to Abdicate and Strive</p>
<p>London: Although the rumor that the King of Siam would cede the throne was denied by the King's official documents, the King's aides today issued an official statement, declaring that "His Majesty is sitting idle and doing nothing to help the country, and hopes to hand over his responsibilities as soon as possible to make way for the wise." According to the rumor that the King of Siam was tired of governing, it was first transmitted to Singapore government officials by the British Embassy in Bangkok, and the King's documents residing in London subsequently denied it. However, today's official document has confirmed the rumor that the King of Siam will cede the throne and revealed that a coup d'état is brewing in Thailand. Then, the future political situation in Thailand will either be the return of the monarch who has been living in Europe for a long time, or the government of the Bangkok National Assembly will take charge. Today's document was issued in the King's name. It is said that "His Majesty is at odds with the government of the National Assembly, and therefore intends to abdicate to give way to the current government, because the King's claim that the points of contention should be resolved through public opinion cannot be carried out. In this case, since there is no way to safeguard civil rights and freedoms, continuing to cling to power would be of no benefit to the country or to the King himself." The document further stated that "The National Assembly recently passed a new criminal law, which the King reluctantly approved, but the King insisted that the matter be submitted to a public vote or a re-election of the National Assembly to clarify that Siam is a constitutional monarchy and not an autocratic monarchy." The dispute between the King and the government is over an old Siamese law, according to which the monarch has the power of life and death. The National Assembly has now revised it, stipulating that the monarch only has the power of pardon, so that Siam can be equal to other constitutional monarchies. The document did not mention the National Assembly's tax policy on the King's private property, but it was mentioned in a telegram from the British Embassy in Bangkok. (28th Day Nationalist Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Siamese King's Power Deprived</h3>
<p>Startling Rumors Are Not Credible</p>
<p>Singapore: According to news from the British Embassy in Bangkok, the King of Siam has decided to cede the throne. It is heard that the King had already requested to abdicate last week, but the government did not accept it. The King's intention is because the government promulgated a new criminal law, changing the death penalty to shooting and abolishing beheading, and abolishing the people's right to petition the King. In this way, the King's remaining power is also deprived. According to well-informed sources, the King is also dissatisfied with the government's tax policy on part of the King's private property. It is found that Siam was originally an autocratic monarchy. After the revolution on June 24, 1932, it was changed to a constitutional monarchy. The constitution stipulates that the supreme sovereignty belongs to the entire people, and the King is the head of state, while the administrative power is exercised by a committee organized by fifteen members of the Nationalist Party. (27th Day Nationalist Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: The decision of the King of Siam to cede the throne has aroused startling rumors about the political situation in Siam. Last night, someone tried to communicate from London to Bangkok, but it was ultimately unsuccessful. As of this morning, the situation in Siam is still unclear. There are rumors in London that a revolution has occurred in Siam. Today, Singapore telegraphs said that Bangkok is now strictly inspecting letters and telegrams. There is also news that the Siamese army is now divided into two factions, one supporting the King and the other opposing him. Except for the Army Minister Bibol, the current government has no important members supporting the King. If the King insists on resigning, the government may choose a young member of the royal family to enthrone and form a regency council. However, many people expect that although the Siamese people are loyal to the King, the declaration of a republic is also expected. According to a Reuters telegram from Bangkok, the King has not actually ceded the throne, but the King and the government have exchanged opinions on the constitutional relationship between the Siamese monarchy and the National Assembly. Many people hope that the King will return to the country soon, as his eye disease is gradually improving. There is no reason to spread startling rumors at present. (27th Day Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Abdication Edict Has Not Been Issued</h3>
<p>However, it Has Been Indicated to the Bangkok Government</p>
<p>London: The King of Siam is now living in seclusion with the Queen at Noel Park in Cranleigh, England. He has now revealed his intention to cede the throne to his government. According to the King's private secretary, who spoke to a Reuters reporter today, the King has not yet signed the document of abdication. According to a law recently passed by the Siamese National Assembly, the provision that the King must approve all sentences of death or life imprisonment in criminal law has been amended. The King refused to approve the案, saying that he must first seek the opinion of the people. However, the National Assembly did not comply with the King's request. Therefore, the King felt that he could no longer protect the rights and freedoms of the people and that it was useless to remain in power, so he had the intention of abdicating. The King's residence in Cranleigh is now heavily guarded by police. The reason why the King refused to approve the bill is that the National Assembly is not a full representative of the people, and half of its members are appointed by Prime Minister Pahol. Therefore, the King believes that this new law should be submitted to a national referendum. The King underwent surgery in London in June this year to remove the cataract from his left eye because of eye disease. He will undergo a second surgery to remove the cataract from his right eye soon. The King ascended the throne in 1925 and is now 41 years old. He is very popular. The Siamese political system was originally autocratic. When the King of Siam was traveling overseas in January 1932, a revolution broke out in the country, demanding democracy. In view of the world's trends, the King issued an edict to implement a constitutional monarchy, and the revolutionary wave calmed down. However, many military officers who held high positions in the old dynasty were dissatisfied with democracy. In June last year, General Pahol, the commander of the Salt Army, overthrew the government in the name of eliminating communism and formed his own government, wielding power alone. At the same time, Prince Bovoradej, the former Minister of Defense, and others led the people to resist Pahol, causing Siam to fall into civil war for two weeks. The King did not want to be controlled by any party and fled to Singora on the Malaysian border. He did not return to the capital until December to convene a new National Assembly.

<h3>Internal Unrest in Austria</h3>
<p>Factions Are Engaging in Squabbles, Plotting Incidents</p>
<p>The Vienna Authorities Are Prepared</p>
<p>Vienna: The major political parties in Austria are not in agreement with each other, which has led to the brewing of internal unrest. The Home Guard, a paramilitary organization similar to the German Social Democratic Party's Blackshirts, is dissatisfied with the progress of fascism, so rumors of the Social Democratic Party staging another revolution have been rampant in recent days. Today, it is also said that the authorities have prepared everything to prevent unexpected incidents. At the same time, 300 long-term soldiers from the army have been transferred to assist the police in maintaining order. Many people believe that although the Social Democratic Party's armed forces are good, staging an incident at the moment would be tantamount to suicide. Some members of the Social Democratic Party believe that all the rumors are spread by the authorities in order to implement a suppression plan. At the same time, another matter that is worrying the government is that the team led by Prime Minister Schuschnigg is at odds with the Home Guard. Both sides are currently doing their best to expand their armaments. Many people fear that the conflict between the two sides will be unavoidable when the personnel of the Guilds and Advisory Bodies are appointed in November according to the new Austrian constitution. The authorities are currently doing their best to avoid serious disturbances. Representatives of the government, led by Prime Minister Schuschnigg, met with parties opposed to iron and close to the German National Party this afternoon, attempting to eliminate differences of opinion. The discussion was based on three points: 1. Recognizing Austria's independence; 2. Rejecting any country's interference in Austria's internal affairs; 3. Avoiding political violence. Although the discussion did not yield results, it will continue. (26th Day Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Roosevelt</p>
<h3>Current Problems</h3>
<p>Balancing the Budget and Undertaking Reconstruction</p>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt will soon concentrate his efforts on the budget and permanent reconstruction law issues. Roosevelt will probably have informal discussions with personnel from the Treasury Department and the Budget Office, as well as congressional leaders, in order to study in detail the government's revenue and the expenditures of various departments. The president's current problems are very difficult, because commercial conditions deteriorated in March, resulting in a shortfall of US$10 million in revenue in the first three and a half months of this economic year compared to the budget, and the government's relief expenses have greatly increased. The federal government's expenditures last year were one of the largest peacetime expenditures in history, costing approximately 56 yuan per person nationwide. At that time, the hope was that commerce could be turned around and tens of millions of impoverished people could receive government relief. However, the government's revenue averaged only 25 yuan per person, which was 31 yuan less than the expenditures. Now the president intends for Congress to pass a permanent relief law, so that the progress that the government has made in the past can be consolidated, and the methods for fighting the economic panic can be broadened. Although the government's greatest objective is to reduce the current hardship, the president also wants to plan for the future, with larger plans such as unemployment insurance, pension plans, and other reform methods, so that the country will not suffer the pain of the economic panic of the past four years again.

<p>Speech by a US Naval Officer</p>
<h3>Upholding a Strong Navy</h3>
<p>The Navy as the Backing of Diplomacy</p>
<p>Washington D.C. Today is Navy Day. Acting Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral [陶雪格] Tauchert, delivered a speech stating that the power of American foreign policy is based on the strength of the American Navy. The fundamental policy of the Navy lies in having sufficient strength, enough to serve as a backing for the U.S. government's commercial and diplomatic policies even if negotiations fail. Other countries want to abandon or reduce battleships because they deeply know that even a small reduction in fleet strength, or if their own navies are reduced equally, would most affect the United States, given its insufficient naval bases and merchant ships. Therefore, the United States must maintain the maximum strength permitted by treaties. Tauchert continued to reiterate the value of the Navy, saying that it is of utmost importance to our nation's foreign policy and that its strength is based on the Navy’s power. Tauchert was likely referring to the Open Door Policy in the Far East and the Monroe Doctrine. He also mentioned the importance of protecting America's overseas territories and the Panama Canal, stating that the Navy is the best defensive weapon against air attacks on the American mainland and protecting America's overseas territories and the Panama Canal. He said, "Currently, airplanes cannot carry fully loaded bombs or other destructive weapons across the ocean, so the air attacks we should be concerned about are only from enemy warships within a thousand miles of our coast. However, these warships would have been sunk long before aerial attacks could be launched." (27th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Anglo-American Meeting Today</h3>
<p>Naval Negotiations at a Critical Juncture</p>
<p>London. Representatives from Britain and the United States have scheduled to resume preliminary naval talks next Monday. Informed sources believe these talks are crucial because Britain will then express its views on the Japanese naval proposals for the first time. It is possible that British representatives will urge the United States to adopt a compromising attitude or even propose a compromise plan. However, it is impossible to predict whether Davis, the chief U.S. representative, and other representatives will accept the British views. If, as speculated, representatives from the U.S. and Japan reconvene next Tuesday, the fate of the naval negotiations will depend on it, and the fate of the U.S.-Japan talks will depend on the outcome of the Anglo-American talks next Monday. (27th Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>London. The first Anglo-American meeting is scheduled to begin on the 29th. Preliminary consultations between Britain and the U.S. had already been underway to a certain extent since mid-July, and informal talks have also recently been held to exchange views. However, the meeting on the 29th will formally begin, and there will be substantial discussions on considerable issues. The prospect of this meeting will realistically influence the realization of Japan's claims. The attitudes of the UK and the US are already close on issues such as maintaining existing treaties and retaining the principle of parity, preserving other aircraft carriers, and abolishing or limiting submarines, which is obvious. However, for the sake of defending territories in both the Eastern and Western Oceans, it is essential to advocate the principle of numerous smaller ships, which is Britain's approach. From the standpoint of transoceanic operations, the U.S. must adhere to its principle of large, long-range ships with heavy guns. Therefore, the UK and the US are in principle in opposing positions. How to reconcile these completely contradictory principles is the key to the success or failure of the Anglo-American compromise. (28th Japan United Press)</p>
<h3>Contents of Anglo-Japanese Talks</h3>
<p>Tokyo. According to comprehensive intelligence from various sources, during the Anglo-Japanese expert meeting on the 26th, representatives from both countries openly shared their views on technical details. As a result, the common maximum limit and other fundamental principles were removed. Regarding the detailed classification of ship types, it seems that a great deal of common ground has been confirmed on all points except for aircraft carriers and submarines. The important parts of the arguments made by the UK and Japan are listed below:</p>
<p>1. (UK) Retain the framework of both the Washington and London Treaties. (Japan) Establish entirely separate new treaties based on a common maximum limit.</p>
<p>2. (UK) Adopt the principle of limiting ship types separately. (Japan) Adopt the principle of total tonnage, but with exceptions when battleships are not abolished.</p>
<p>3. (UK) The battleship type should be 25,000 tons with a gun caliber of 12 inches. The total tonnage must be reduced somewhat.</p>
<p>(Japan) If all countries agree to abolish them, then the battleship type, total tonnage, and other conditions will be discussed with each country before a decision is made in the case of retaining them.</p>
<p>4. (UK) Oppose the abolition of aircraft carriers, and advocate reducing the ship type and its total tonnage, etc.</p>
<p>(Japan) Advocate absolute abolition.</p>
<p>5. (UK) Maintain the status quo for heavy cruisers.</p>
<p>(Japan) Although there is no major disagreement with this claim, it should be as short as possible.</p>
<p>6. (UK) The ship type limit for light cruisers is 6,000 to 7,000 tons, and the number of ships is set at more than 70. If an increase is necessary, it should be recognized that the tonnage from other ship types can be used to accommodate this.</p>
<p>(Japan) From the standpoint of the total tonnage principle, support this flexible approach.</p>
<p>7. (UK) Advocate for the abolition or major reduction of submarines. (Japan) Advocate for the free construction of the necessary amount. (28th Japan United Press)</p>
<p>London. The press here, observing the London Naval Conference, acknowledges that the differences of opinion between the UK and Japan are difficult to overcome, but it also believes that at least partial success cannot be achieved. The Times reports that the naval conference must not fail. None of the three countries involved want to hear of failure. Once the naval conference fails and countries engage in naval competition, the political and economic consequences would be alarming. For our country, for various reasons, the hope for a settlement is particularly urgent. The people of our country have no real or latent animosity towards foreign countries, and we possess large ships sufficient to secure the Empire's traffic and trade routes. However, the disputes in the naval conference are ostensibly about ship types and ratios, but in reality, there are political differences. Therefore, the failure to reconcile opinions from all sides is becoming increasingly apparent. Although naval experts have the support of the government, the knot of the problem is becoming more deeply rooted and cannot be handled by naval experts.</p>
<p>To avoid the above differences, the UK, the U.S., and Japan should engage in open discussions on a broad foundation to replace the current naval conference, with the goal of resolving the revealed problems through trilateral agreement. The Sunday Public Opinion, observing from a political and economic standpoint, believes that an agreement between the UK and Japan on naval issues is almost inevitable. It states that the current London Naval Conference should be observed from the following perspective: that commercial cooperation between the UK and Japan will lead to political cooperation between the two countries. There is nothing secret about this. What needs to be explained now is that the UK's large investments in Manchukuo make the security of Manchukuo extremely important to the UK. If the UK and Japan achieve coordination in economics, then military and naval coordination is possible and necessary. This is the reason why the U.S. representatives are suspicious at the London Naval Conference, because they are deeply afraid that the UK and Japan will create a fait accompli before the future naval conference.

<p>Resolution of the French Radical Party</p>
<h3>Maintaining the Political Truce</h3>
<p>Herriot's Word Carries Weight</p>
<p>The Current Cabinet Gains Stability</p>
<p>South Terrace. The Cabinet was shaken by the Radical Socialist Party's dissatisfaction with Prime Minister Doumergue's proposal for constitutional reform. Now this fear has been dispelled. Today, at a large meeting of the Radical Socialist Party in the South Terrace, its leader Herriot gave a speech strongly urging party members to maintain the political truce. After explaining the overall situation, Herriot declared, "I have only one more word to say, which is that January 13, 1935, is the date of the Saar plebiscite." Herriot's warning had an almost magical effect. After the speech, the assembly almost unanimously resolved to maintain the political truce, which is the condition under which the current government was formed. However, the assembly also resolved to instruct the Radical Socialist Party's cabinet members to discuss compromise measures with the Prime Minister. (27th Reuters) South Terrace. The Radical Socialist Party congress closed today. The party's official declaration was unanimously adopted. It vehemently criticized currency devaluation, saying that some people talk at length about the benefits of currency devaluation, but in reality, the benefits of currency devaluation are like castles in the sky, only enough to benefit speculators, while honest workers are bankrupted. The declaration concludes by advocating for making every effort to gradually reduce international armaments and to place the manufacture and sale of munitions under international supervision.

<h3>The Racial Concept of the German Socialist Party</h3>
<p>How Germany is excluding Jews is little known. Here is what [葛羅斯] Gross, Minister of Racial Politics of the National Socialist Party, said: When the new National Socialist Germany first formulated various regulations last year based on the latest academic research in racial studies by specialized experts, some nations in the world misunderstood or misinterpreted these measures. However, if Jewish people instigate and stand behind such misconceptions, we can disregard everything. As for foreign arguments, some, like the Jewish people themselves, are fundamentally unwilling to understand the laws formulated based on the results of academic research on race, so we can let them be. Also, some viewpoints in the world are universalist, believing that promoting racial concepts may be dangerous politically. As for those in the world who cannot understand these regulations formulated based on the results of academic research on race, we are really surprised, because most civilized nations have always adhered to racial concepts. For example, the British pay great attention to various ethnic groups in their country adhering to the principle of racial purity. However, these ethnic groups also hold the same and clear attitude towards the British, preserving the honor of their race. For this reason, many Indians, especially Japanese, will never allow their race to be mixed with Caucasians, and both sides strive to preserve the purity of their respective races. Such independent preservation of the purity of each race has never affected politics or social interactions. Some criticize Germany for excluding foreigners (such as Jews) from government service, but other countries have similar measures. Let's first take an American behavior as an international precedent. For example, the attitude of Americans towards black people in political and social life can be regarded as intentional racial discrimination. Especially in immigration laws, Americans have a clear distinction between various ethnic groups moving to their country from Europe. The number of immigrants stipulated by the U.S. government is also very different for European countries. The purpose of this distinction is to welcome ethnic groups similar to Americans to move to the country in large numbers, while on the other hand, the purpose is to prevent people of a race whose spirit is inconsistent with America from going. From the U.S.'s subjective point of view, ethnic groups similar to the U.S. immigrating to the U.S. are of special value to U.S. national relations. If we take this kind of precedent as a comparison, it is really amazing that most countries in the world have great distinctions in laws based on various races. However, why is most of the world not understanding Germany's imitation or not fully understanding the racialism under German National Socialism? The reason for explaining it clearly today is that German National Socialism treats the races of the world the same. Our National Socialist Party members solemnly declare that the races of the world should each retain their inherent cultural characteristics. National Socialism believes that the confusion of human races is dangerous to the cultural characteristics of both sides. German National Socialism's observation of the confusion of humans is consistent with the observation of the Far Eastern people. For thousands of years, the Far Eastern people, such as the Chinese, have maintained the purity of their families through familism, which is really worthy of emulation. Therefore, in this scope, the new Germany is a disciple of Chinese culture and wisdom. Those who understand this will judge that the racial concepts under National Socialism, which are promoted abroad, are hostile to foreign residents in Germany, which is definitely a misunderstanding. Furthermore, this kind of hostile concept is almost non-existent in National Socialism, and it is either the intentional secret instigation of opponents or the inability to understand Hitler's worldview. After hundreds of years of wandering, we Germans have now recognized the original nature and value of our bloodline. Each race has its own special talent, and this talent cannot be destroyed by the unconscious confusion of various races. For example, Chinese and Mongolians living in Germany can maintain the dignity of their own race. We Germans should naturally now also preserve the dignity of our race. This can maintain its emotions in both political and private social interactions between hosts and guests without causing any impact. Because we treat our friends with the courtesy they deserve, and we especially admire the talents of different guests, we also hope that the other party will have the same impression of our talents. Therefore, the racialism under National Socialism not only eliminates racial hatred and competition but also creates a spirit of mutual respect, which can be regarded as the foundation of world peace. Our responsibility is to make efforts to eliminate misunderstandings about this racial concept at home and abroad so that the world can understand it. All those who make false propaganda about the racial concepts of National Socialism are our enemies because this is all incitement to destroy the friendship between our leader Hitler and the German people, who recognize race, and other overseas Germans.

<p>Kalinin's Views</p>
<h3>Soviet Election Work</h3>
<p>Moscow. Kalinin, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union, published an article in various newspapers today, stating that the Soviet election campaign is approaching, which is of great significance politically. The Soviet working people have made great progress in politics and culture, and their understanding of national discipline and national responsibility has also greatly increased. In today's world, no other country has its masses maintaining such close relations with the state and organically concerned about general national policies as the Soviet Union. This is not an overstatement. The Soviet Union welcomes its new election campaign with its great achievements. The acquisition of these achievements requires a great deal of sacrifice, labor, energy, and perseverance. The path of Soviet heavy industry towards independence is characterized by the construction and installation of its great buildings using our own methods and Soviet-made machinery. From a technical point of view, our country's dependence on the capitalist world is decreasing day by day. The development of industry, especially the production of agricultural machinery, allows us to adopt a collective farming system, while at the same time allowing farmers to participate in the construction of a socialist society. When Kalinin mentioned the Soviet Union's international situation, he said that a few years ago, various military plans were still being concealed from the public, but today, some countries are openly promoting war and advertising war with a mocking attitude. As for other countries, they are also using this point to expand their armaments. Our country's upcoming election will show the world that the Soviet Union's face is completely different. The Soviet Union is realizing Lenin's ideal of liberating mankind from the form of slavery mentioned above. (27th TASS)</p>
<p>England to Australia Air Race</p>
<h3>New Zealand Ranks Fifth</h3>
<p>London. English aviators Jones and Waller are now flying back to London from Australia, hoping to set a new record. They continued onward from Darwin Port this morning at 9:20 AM, flying towards Singapore. They were originally scheduled to depart last night, but due to strong winds and rain in the Timor Sea, they did not proceed. However, the aviators hope to make up for the lost time later on the trip. The current record for air travel between England and Australia is held by Scott, the champion of this race, who spent nine days from England to Australia and ten days and twenty-three hours from Australia back to England.</p>
<p>Two hours before Jones and Waller flew away from Darwin Port this morning, the brother machine piloted by pilots taking part in the England and Australia air obstacle race, one piloted by Hewitt and the other piloted by Keith, flew to the Newcastle Watt verification station after a short stop. The former was detained because one of the machine’s driving members was hit by a propulsion engine.</p>

<h3>Administrative Conference Opens</h3>
<p>One Hundred and Twenty Attending Experts and County Magistrates</p>
<p>Five Types of Proposals, Totaling Four Hundred and Four Items</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The first Hebei Provincial Administrative Conference, which has been in preparation for three months, opened on the morning of the 25th at 9:00 am in the auditorium of the Hebei Huangwei Road Industrial College. A total of 44 county magistrates were expected to participate, but Liu Huanwen, magistrate of Handan County, was unable to attend due to the distance and busy county affairs, and Shu Naifan, magistrate of Gaocheng County, was ill in the inn after arriving in Tianjin, and both requested leave. A total of 42 counties attended. Twenty-six experts and administrative inspectors were invited to attend as observers, along with 120 people, including the directors, commissioners, section chiefs, and secretaries of the provincial government departments. Three people, including Luo Longji, attended as observers. A total of 404 proposals were submitted, including 194 proposals related to civil affairs, 50 proposals related to education, 38 proposals related to construction, 48 proposals related to industry, and 74 proposals related to finance. These five types of proposals focus primarily on matters that are universally relevant to the entire province. Proposals related to special circumstances in a single county were not submitted. Therefore, they are referred to as 404 proposals. If they are categorized according to their similar nature, there are only about half that number. This conference was attended by more than one-third of the county magistrates in the province. The remaining counties that did not attend will be invited to the second and third conferences. Yu Xuezhong advocated for the reduction and merger of bureaus and departments in various counties to be realized by the end of the year. Therefore, this conference specifically proposed the question of how the administrative priorities of various counties should be handled in order of urgency and importance, so that the county magistrates and experts in attendance could study and discuss the matter together. Among the experts at this conference, two were world-renowned: Yan Yangchu, who studies rural administration and rural education, and Chen Zhushan, a colleague of Dr. Yan. Both attended and participated in the discussions on the 25th, and submitted multiple proposals for reforming rural administration, which will be the goal of the resolutions of this conference. The opening of the conference at 9:00 am on the 25th was quite solemn. Yu Xuezhong was in Hankou and had not returned, so Wei Jian, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, presided over the conference on his behalf. Cha Yao, Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, read Yu's opening address and reported on the preparatory work. Wei Jian then gave an opening speech. Yan Zhiyi and Zhang Lisheng, members of the Provincial Committee, gave speeches. Representatives from the Ministry of Finance, Ding Chungao, and experts Yan Yangchu and Zhang Boling, as well as Chen Fangxian, a member of the Provincial Party Department, spoke one after another. Chen Zhongyue, magistrate of Tianjin County, then gave a reply. The meeting was then adjourned for a group photo. At 2:00 pm, the first plenary session was held. All 404 proposals were categorized and reviewed according to their nature. It was decided to form five groups: The Civil Affairs Group elected Yan Zhiyi, Yan Yangchu, and Tao Shangming as members. Thirty-six people were elected and convened by Wei Jian. The Finance Group elected Ding Chungao, Yin Rugeng, and Yang Tianshou as members. Twenty-eight people were elected and convened by Lu Muting. The Education Group elected Zhang Lisheng and Chen Zhushan as members. Twenty-two people were elected and convened by Zhou Binglin. The Construction Group elected Li Shutian and Zhang Hengmao as members. Fifteen people were elected and convened by Lin Chengxiu. The Industry Group elected Liang Jianjun and Sun Jiayan as members. Fourteen people were elected and convened by Shi Jingshi. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 pm on the 25th. The Civil Affairs Department hosted a special banquet in the Provincial Government Auditorium to entertain the experts and county magistrates in attendance. Review meetings were held on the morning and afternoon of the 26th. Review meetings were held on the morning and afternoon of the 27th. The 28th was a day of rest. The third plenary session will be held on the morning of the 30th, and group review meetings will be held in the afternoon. The meeting will adjourn at 5:00 pm. According to the Civil Affairs Department, the minimum outcome of this conference should be the implementation of the reduction and merger of bureaus and departments, saving expenses, and the consolidation of financial administration and the elimination of local bandits.

<h3>The Difficulties of the British Textile Industry</h3>
<p>Existing Markets Are Difficult to Maintain</p>
<p>Current Strong Enemies Are Becoming Stronger</p>
<p>Britain is indeed getting old. In form, it still勉強maintains its position as the maritime hegemon, and seems to be able to lead the industry of the present world and occupy the top position in maritime commerce. However, the actual situation has changed, especially in the past three or four years. For example, the textile industry of Lancashire, which is Britain's leading industry, has been declining year by year. Compared with its good friend in the Far East, Japan, a strong enemy in the cotton industry market, it is even more lagging behind. Even though its cotton cloth exports to Europe increased by a little more than 10% in the first half of this year, and its exports to North America increased by 60%, these are the results of the implementation of group economics since the Ottawa Imperial Economic Conference, and also the good situation of the British national economy as a whole.</p>
<p>However, in Asia, cotton cloth exports to China in the first half of this year decreased by 5.6% compared with the same period last year, exports to Japan decreased by 4%, exports to Hong Kong decreased by 7.6%, and exports to the Philippines decreased by 6.4%. Exports to various parts of Africa (including British colonies) decreased by nearly 3% in total, and exports to South American countries decreased by 0.6%. Taking the whole calculation, British cotton cloth exports decreased by 15%. This situation makes the British textile industry feel that thorns are growing in its future and that the difficulties ahead will not be easy to overcome.</p>
<p>Therefore, it has to quickly find other ways to reverse the future misfortunes and prevent the current situation from getting worse. All countries in the world are working hard to implement group economics, encourage exports, and restrict imports. In other words, they are intensifying overseas economic competition and implementing domestic economics, encouraging exports, and restricting imports. In other words, they are not intensifying overseas economic competition and implementing domestic economic control. However, Britain has always valued liberal economics. Although it has recently made every effort to implement group economics within the British Empire, unreasonable competition still exists in production, listing, and market prices. As long as this element exists, Britain is at a disadvantage in foreign competition. Therefore, its most important problem at present is to consider how to break the traditional individualism of the factory owners in Lancashire, so that they can all agree on the following reform plans: 1. Eliminate competition among textile industrialists. On the surface, this kind of competition seems to be beneficial to consumers and is also a good phenomenon for the progress of the industry. However, the current era is different. The progress of technology is almost at its peak. Therefore, competition among the same industry is to put itself at a disadvantage. For the sake of a unified foreign pace, this domestic industry competition must be restricted, and ways must be found to unify prices and control production.</p>
<p>2. Organize the surplus spindles. It is well known that the equipment of British spinning mills is relatively old, and the mechanical structure is not in line with the needs of the times. It is undeniable that overseas markets have been occupied by others. If the excessive spindles are not organized and eliminated, it is a loss to the industry itself. However, the reason why the British textile industry has declined is due to its own shortcomings as mentioned above, and there are other factors. For example, all countries in the world are working hard for domestic self-sufficiency, so they increase tax revenue, so that British products cannot be exported as desired. In addition, although emerging countries such as China and India have not been able to develop heavy industry for a while, light industry, especially the textile industry, has not been able to develop very quickly. What's more, the general wages in their countries are relatively cheap, and the transportation of raw materials is also very convenient. As a result, Britain gradually lost its original market. Furthermore, the emerging Japan has not only made considerable progress in light industry, but also used its low wages, convenient transportation, and special economic conditions (such as political relations and the depreciation of the yen) to develop rapidly, and even compete with Britain all over the world. Wherever there is a market for British textiles, there are Japanese products competing with it. Secondly, all agricultural countries are affected by the world economic panic. The export of raw materials is inevitably stagnant, and the import of manufactured goods will naturally decrease. The purchasing power of the general public has declined. British textiles are relatively high-end and the prices are relatively expensive, which makes it even more difficult for them to purchase them. Therefore, the number of people who have lost their jobs in the textile industry has reached 24.4%. The average for other industries is only 16.6%. This is a major problem that is the most difficult for Britain to solve. (September 27th in London)</p>
<h3>Japanese Urgently Plan Japanese-Puppet Currency Alliance</h3>
<p>Promoting Puppet Organizations to Adopt the Gold Standard</p>
<p>Intending to Annex the Economic Rights of Puppet Organizations</p>
<p>According to the Japanese Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, the currency system of Manchukuo will be changed from the silver standard to the gold standard. However, technical issues such as the time of realization and methods are still awaiting general understanding. Recently, Takahashi Ginkichi went to Manchuria to inspect the Manchurian economy. Considering the economic difficulties of the Manchus in gold and silver exchange and the decrease in the amount of Japanese currency in circulation, which are inversely proportional, he strongly advocated that the Manchurian economy originally had close ties with China. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully consider the sudden separation from the Chinese relationship and economic independence. During the 18th Joint Conference of Manchurian Chambers of Commerce held in Changchun, important motions were put forward regarding the issue of the monetary system and direct relations, advocating that Japan and Manchuria should forge a currency alliance. The nature of this case is quite significant and cannot be resolved in a short period of time. Later, because no decision could be made at the meeting, it was transferred to the Continuing Committee for discussion. According to the statement of the Harbin Chamber of Commerce at that time, the main points of its advocacy were that the Harbin business community believed that Japan and Manchuria were inseparable in terms of politics, economy, and national defense. The economic division should first form an economic alliance, namely, the Japan-Manchuria Customs Union and the Japan-Manchuria Currency Union. These two major issues are the foundation for the conclusion of the Japan-Manchuria Economic Alliance. However, after analyzing and criticizing the current economic situation of Manchuria and its relationship with the current system, the relationship between Japanese and Manchurian currencies should be linked through inductive methods. Therefore, the hopes of Japanese merchants and industrialists in Manchuria are: first, the depreciation of the national currency value in commerce and industry; second, the stability of the relationship between the Japanese and Manchurian currency values. Generally speaking, Japan and Manchuria should adopt the same monetary system, and the relationship between the currencies of the two countries should be stabilized. Because the first type is not easy to achieve at present, they are urgently seeking to stabilize the latter. The realistic methods proposed for the conclusion of the Japan-Manchuria Currency Alliance are roughly as follows: The Bank of Japan will transfer 60 million yuan as the reserve of the Central Bank of Manchuria. This will be used as a legal reserve, and banknotes will be issued and delivered to the Central Bank of Manchuria as a legal reserve for issuing the required national currency banknotes, etc.</p>
<h3>Wang Chonghui Arrives in Beiping</h3>
<p>Reports to Chiang Kai-shek on His Trip to the Southwest</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Wang Chonghui returned to Nanjing from Hong Kong and Guangdong. Because Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was in Beiping, he took the through train from Nanjing to Beiping to meet with him. He arrived in Beiping at 10:20 a.m. today (the 27th). Huang Fu's representatives, He Qigong and Zhang Jianchu, Beiping Mayor Yuan Liang, and Beiping-Tianjin Garrison Commander Wang Shuchang, etc., welcomed him at the station. After Wang got off the train, he shook hands with the welcoming personnel and then went to the Beijing Hotel accompanied by He Qigong and Yuan Liang to meet with Chiang Kai-shek and report on his trip to Hong Kong and Guangdong. According to Wang's conversation, the following points were made: 1. I have not been to Beiping for seven years. This time, I came to pay respects to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, report on my trip to the Southwest, and visit old friends. I will stay in Beiping for four or five days and then return to Nanjing and Shanghai. Whether or not I will go to the Southwest again depends on the needs. 2. The Southwest and the Central Government have the same goals for the country and are spiritually united, and there is no problem. 3. The British Industrial Delegation went to Puppet Manchuria to investigate. Before leaving, they made a statement and did not express political views. However, the delegation's visit to Puppet Manchuria was entirely for the development of commerce, but its actual significance was very important. Recently, reports have stated that the delegation has expressed political views, which British public opinion has denied. Our country has not yet confirmed this matter. 5. The Fifth National Congress has now been postponed and will be decided after the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee on December 10. (27th)</p>

<h3>Guangdong Controls the Cement Industry</h3>

Canal water overflowed in the city, willows lined the road, the population was large, and the shops were bustling. Outside the city, I crossed the Shandan River, which is the eastern source of the Ruoshui River mentioned in Yu Gong. Ten miles to the west, I passed the Great Buddha Temple. Upon entering, I saw the Heng and Ha Generals, and further in, the Four Heavenly Kings and the Eighteen Arhats, etc. The Grand Hall of the Great Buddha was built on the Lion Mountain and was seven stories high. In the center sat the Great Buddha. Measuring its toenails, they were one foot and two inches long. To see the face of the Buddha, one had to climb to the highest floor. Someone stood on the Buddha's shoulder to take a picture, and it was seen that the person's height did not even reach the middle of the Buddha's ear. Therefore, the height of the Great Buddha was not as great as the ten-fold of the legend, but it must have been seven or eight zhang. There was a mire under the mountain, and three vehicles were trapped, and they could not be rescued even after half a day. At that time, I saw women riding in ox carts coming to the temple to burn incense. Among them were three or four with rural faces, and their postures were healthy and beautiful, no less than the beauties of the South. Later, I hired someone to unload the goods and drag the carts out. Each person was rewarded with a pair of empty oil drums, and they were all happy and running. There were two Fan people, lamas, who sat on the grass for a long time and did not leave. When they saw that those who exerted effort were rewarded, they suddenly grabbed forward to get them. When asked why they did not help, they replied that they had chanted scriptures for the car and prayed for it to reach the other shore early. The driver said it was fun.</p>
<p>Then I crossed the Clear Water River, passing through Shiwu Li Pu, Ershi Li Pu, Da Qiaozhai, and other villages. Along the way, the mountains were green and the water was clear, willows lined the road, and wild sheep were as white as snowflakes. After crossing a beach, I arrived at Dongle County. The city was about three li in circumference, with a jurisdiction of only one hundred fifty or sixty square li, and was a small county in Longxi. Fifteen li to the west of the beach, I entered Zhangye territory, and twenty li later, I arrived at Renshou Village and stayed overnight. From Xinhe Post Station to here, I traveled thirty-eight English miles, totaling one hundred twenty-six li. There was an ancient fortress in the village, dilapidated and high. In the Han Dynasty, it was Wolan County, so it was also called Ancient City Village. In the past, the residents filled the entire city, but now there are only sixteen or seventeen, totaling eighty or ninety families. There was a primary school in the village. When I entered to look, I did not see any students. Only a millstone was placed there. When asked, I learned that there were several students when school started, but after a long time, they all retreated and did not come. They had to wait for the next semester to start and gather them again. I set off the next day, about forty li, passing through a beach about ten li wide in the middle. Then, amid the dense branches of the Long trees, I arrived at Zhangye City. Zhangye was formerly Ganzhou and was also one of the four counties in Hexi. The city is located on the Shandan River and has a circumference of twelve li. It is neat, Liu Gao is strong, and it is only seen when coming from the west. However, fearing the trouble of inspection, I specially passed around the South Gate and did not have the opportunity to visit the city, which was a pity. At the peaks of the north and south mountains in the county, snow melted and poured into fifty canals. Therefore, agricultural products are abundant, especially rice is a major export. On the north and south slopes of the mountain, in the area of Wanlanggou, Santiao Ridge, Da Xiaoliba, and so on, there is a large coal area with a width of fifty or sixty li. Coal seams and oil naturally gush from the ground, everywhere you look. Residents dig and extract from the kilns. If they encounter floods or the kiln soil is loose, they change places to mine, opening and abandoning them. A lot of coal is wasted. However, the amount of coal transported and sold to Zhangye, Linze, Gaotai and other counties every year is as high as 3.6 million catties, and the price of coal is low. Each hundred catties only sells for two or three hundred cash in the production area, and only five or six hundred cash when transported by livestock to the sales area. As for the refining of oil, no one has even considered it. When I was about to set off from Renshou Village, I settled the account with the shopkeeper on his smoking kang (the earthen kang can smoke). I suddenly saw a letter from a wife to her husband. The shopkeeper said that someone had lost it here and that it had been opened long ago and read by many people. The affection was touching. In addition to conveniently delivering it for her, I will also publish the original text as follows, which will not harm morality. The original letter said:</p>
<p>My dear husband,</p>
<p>Since you left for Xining in early May, I don’t know how your eye disease is. I am very worried. I also went to Xining, but on the way, I heard that you were developing Ganzhou, which made me very disappointed. But it is also my luck. You are like a conscript, and I am a wanton woman. Since I have been left unattended for a long time, how can I ask for zither and lute? (There is a typo in the sentence.) Two days after you left, the whole family, big and small, more than 20 people, were all well. However, there has been discord in the family recently, which is even worse than before. There is constant quarreling every day, and my son and I are restless. I want to go to Ganzhou again, first because I have no money, and second because the road is long and I am afraid of being hungry and cold on the road. Therefore, I dare not go rashly. Oh, my husband, you will know my pain after seeing this letter. If you do not forget the love of husband and wife, have pity on your wife and daughter, and live separately from your humble wife, or bring your little daughter to you, whether it is possible or not, you must give your concubine a conscience, so that your concubine can be spared from crying all day long. Alas, my husband is at the edge of the sky, and my concubine is at the corner of the earth. The vast blue sky and the layers of thousands of mountains and ridges, I have hatred, but what can I do? Paper is short and words are long, all in one word. When we meet again in person, I will talk about all the difficulties in my heart. I wish you well. Your humble concubine Luo Xu, and her little daughter Fengxian, pay their respects. The 3rd day of the 6th month of the old calendar, a certain street in Ledu, Qinghai, sealed. The original paper was folded into a seal, and the outside said, “Please take it to a certain class in a certain company in Ganzhou and ask Luo to receive it.” Although this is a private letter, it has exposed several inferior aspects of the current society. 1. The darkness of the extended family system and its impending collapse, even in remote border towns, has become increasingly acute. 2. Since ancient times, when men were conscripted into the army, beautiful women resented guarding empty boudoirs. This is not only true of Luo and his wife. According to the letter, Luo and his family are reunited, but there are still such affectionate complaints. What about soldiers in other provinces who are not given leave? 3. The above letter was probably not written by the person herself, nor was it written by a scribe at a writing stall. It must have been written by someone like a primary school teacher. From this, we can see the level of thought of rural primary school teachers and a class of popular literature in the countryside. 4. There are no postal services in rural areas, and letters are entrusted to people to bring, and omissions in the middle are inevitable. Taking the above letter as an example, when Luo’s wife entrusted someone to bring it, she must have thought it was reliable, but it was unexpectedly lost in the middle. She did not receive a reply for a long time. She must have suspected that her husband had forgotten his feelings, and she would feel the pain of her concubine’s so-called inability to give her a conscience. If she is subjected to the darkness and oppression of the family, it is inevitable that unexpected and unfortunate things will happen. These are my thoughts on this lost family letter.</p>
<p>Gansu Province</p>
<h3>Investigation of Disaster-Stricken Counties</h3>
<p>Overview of the Second Half of This Year</p>
<p>Lanzhou Correspondence: Gansu Province has suffered from natural disasters and man-made disasters for many years. Disasters such as floods, droughts, hail, wind, and bandits have affected almost the entire province. The eyes are full of exhaustion, and it is extremely tragic. The following is a brief overview of the disaster-stricken counties in the second half of this year:</p>
<p>Floods</p>
<p>The Zagu disaster was mainly caused by rain. The worst-hit areas were near the county seat and the Longyugou Xiaoshagou area. Several thousand mu of farmland were flooded. In Kang County, the disaster area was near the county seat. On August 7, there was heavy rain that lasted for two days and one night. Mountain torrents broke out and the plains became rivers, destroying more than ten zhang of the city walls. In the Minquan County disaster area, the sixth district under the county was the worst. In July, there was continuous heavy rain, and the water in the streams and ditches erupted into rivers. The disaster losses are currently under investigation.</p>
<p>Mutiny</p>
<p>The disaster area in Lintao was the first and second districts under the county. Qiang Ma Liuquan attacked the county area twice. Because they did not succeed, they looted the townships and towns, looting livestock and property, and emptying the grain, rice, and noodles. They committed adultery, torture, and did everything. The disaster losses are estimated at more than 79,000 yuan. Gaolan suffered from the disaster of open water. Since autumn, there has been continuous rain, and the rainwater has penetrated the ground to a depth of five or six feet in all places. Many houses in the city were flooded. The walls around the city pass were in disrepair for many years. From the East Pass to the east and west of Xiaoshaomen, the collapse site was about one zhang. The area west of the South Shaomen was even more difficult to count. The Jingchuan and Yanjing rivers rose together, and the river water rose sharply, causing great disaster losses.</p>
<p>Drought</p>
<p>Wudu suffered from a severe drought. After rain fell in March, there was no thorough rain until the end of August. Summer crops were happily harvested, but autumn crops could not be sown. Even if they were forced to sow, after seeing the sprouts, they withered again. The hail in Ningding was a disaster, and the mountains, rivers, seedlings, and crops were all damaged. It is estimated that 338 mu of land were affected, and 171 households were affected. Wild boars in Wen County roamed in groups, eating the crops in the fields. The villagers were unable to prevent them and were worried. The crops in the fields were mostly eaten and trampled. Hail in Huining County was as big as shotguns and lasted for 20 minutes. The crops were severely damaged.</p>
<p>Banditry</p>
<p>The Communist bandits in Zhenning were a disaster. The villages and towns in the central, southern, and western districts were nailed with countless people. Property losses amounted to more than 73,700 yuan, and more than 1,400 stones of grain were robbed. Autumn crops in Guyuan were almost completely damaged by hail. Because the four counties of Heyong, Qingyang, Ning County, and Huan County were occupied by Communist bandits, it is still impossible to investigate. Linxia was washed away by water, and the former fertile land has now become a sandy riverbed.</p>
<p>From Xiangshuikou to Qingdao</p>
<h3>Huaan Ship Sinks</h3>
<p>Twelve Crew Members and Passengers Missing</p>
<p>Ship's Actual Loss Estimated at 50,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The Huaan Ship, owned by Yongyuansheng on Guanxian Road in this city, encountered a strong wind on the way from Xiangshuikou to Qingdao on the 23rd of this month and tragically sank. A total of 32 crew members and passengers, only 10 escaped, and the remaining 22 were all reported missing. The following are the details of its sinking:</p>
<p>The Huaan Ship was previously represented by Ying Ji Hang. The hull was wooden, 152 feet long, and the total tonnage was 411 tons. Its route was between Qingdao, Shijiusuo, Haizhou, and Xiangshuikou, carrying cargo. The captain, Tang Guangming, together with the sailors, servants, and crew, totaled 26 people. On the 20th of this month, it sailed from Qingdao to Xiangshuikou. On the 23rd, it loaded a total of 1,600 bags of wheat, chicken eggs, sesame seeds, soybeans, etc. in Xiangshuikou, and there were 6 passengers. At 1:00 p.m. on that day, it weighed anchor and sailed to Qingdao. It was about 100 li to the outlet of Dipiao to the vicinity of Kaishan. The sky was already dark, and it happened to encounter a strong north wind and unusually dangerous waves. At that time, the Tongxing Ship of the Yutai Shipping Company also sailed from Yancheng to Qingdao. Looking from a distance, the Huaan was rising and falling in the waves. The situation was extremely dangerous. In an instant, the sky was dark, and the Huaan's image could no longer be seen. However, the Tongyu Ship was small, but fortunately it was made of iron, so it could withstand the waves and returned to the city from great danger. The Huaan was originally scheduled to arrive in Qingdao on the morning of the 24th, but there was no news for several days. On the 27th, a telegram was received from Xiangshuikou, stating that the Huaan Ship had encountered an accident and sunk completely on the evening of the 23rd. After the accident, the crew members and sailors who knew how to swim tried their best to struggle. Fortunately, a small boat passed by and went forward to rescue them. Ten people were saved from the disaster, but after being rescued, two of the ten people died from drinking too much water. Other crew members and bait customers, as well as a large number of cargo ships, were all sunk at the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>According to the manager of the shipping company, Huang Wenming, the Huaan Ship was not insured. The cargo loaded from Xiangshuikou this time was worth about 30,000 yuan, and the loss on the return shipping side was about 50,000 yuan. In addition to reporting to the Jiaohai Customs to send a ship to the scene of the accident for investigation, it was also decided to send another ship to salvage the ship today (28th). As for all the aftermath methods, a decision will be made after a thorough investigation. (28th)</p>
<p>Repairing Qufu</p>
<h3>Construction of the Confucius and Yan Temple Project is Actively Underway</h3>
<p>Selling Dried Trees in the Forest Temple and Planting New Seedlings</p>
<p>Donations from Various Provinces are Continuously Remitted to Shandong</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: To repair the Confucius and Yan Temples in Qufu, the central government's donation of 100,000 yuan has been remitted first, and donations from various provinces are also being remitted continuously. Therefore, the Shandong Provincial Preparatory Committee for the Repair of the Confucius Temple is actively underway. The engineering and general affairs teams have been established. The engineering team is headed by Zhang Honglie, Director of the Construction Department, and the general affairs team is headed by Zhang Shaotang, Secretary-General of the Provincial Government. Today (26th), the committee held another meeting in the provincial government. All the committee members attended, reported on the donations received, and resolved to auction off dry trees with the Confucius and Yan clans and plant new items. 1. Since the 14th Standing Committee meeting, 100,000 yuan of donations from the central government have been received and are now being presented to the accounting section of the provincial government. 1. Yunnan Provincial Government Secretariat's telegram opened: Chairman Long donated 4,000 yuan of group currency for the repair of the Confucius Temple. Where should the money be remitted?

Dean Dai and others' reports have been reserved and undecided, including items such as direct descendants of the Confucius clan and Confucian doctors, direct descendants of various sages, and Confucian scholars. 1. The report on the 5th of this month stated that the Zhicheng Central Standing Committee passed two measures for the repair and maintenance of the Qufu Confucius Mausoleum. 1. Dean Ju of Nanjing sent a telegram: I am deeply impressed by the restoration of the Confucius Temple. I am now working hard on the design and will report when it is completed. Matters for discussion: 1. A letter from the Shandong Provincial Government stated that many of the trees in the Qufu Confucius and Yan Temples are dry and should be auctioned off and replanted with new trees. Please send personnel to discuss with the person in charge of the Confucius Temple and reply with the handling situation. How should it be handled? Please make a public decision. It was resolved that the planting of trees in the Confucius Temple and Yan Temple should be handled by the Engineering Team in consultation with the Confucius and Yan Mansions.</p>

<p>Central Dignitaries Visit Yu Mountain</p>
<p>Songyi's Nine Peaks and Three Qings are famous for their scenery, and among the Nine Peaks, Yu Mountain is the best for construction. Looking up, the Three Qings are all in sight. The mountain is located between Songqing and Qingyi, and there is a Catholic church built here. Every year in March, a mass is held, and Catholic friends from all over come to worship. Wang Zhengting, a member of the Central Executive Committee, Gu Weijun, the French minister, and Niu Yongjian, the vice president of the Examination Yuan, made an appointment to take a special car to Songjiang via the highway this morning (29th).

The National Medicine Le, Restaurant Industry, Gangbu Public, Foreign Guanghuo Industry, Cheng Industry, Teahouse Industry, Land Industry, Zao Fang Industry, Fresh Meat Industry, and other public associations, as well as the Ye Xie branch office, sent letters stating that the scheduled date of the members' meeting coincides with the start of the new season, when the business of each industry is booming. It would be difficult to attend at that time, which would hinder the association's affairs, and the number of attendees would inevitably be insufficient. Please postpone the date of the fourth members' meeting. It was resolved to allow the postponement and send letters to various public associations for their information.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>

<h3>Nanhui</h3>
<p>Implementing the Baojia System on a Regular Basis</p>
<p>The county government, in order to implement the Baojia system as ordered, urgently needs to actively proceed.

In addition, the compilation of Baojia is a pioneering undertaking.

The Education Bureau will also be ordered to instruct all schools and social education institutions, and the Public Security Bureau will be responsible for assisting in the propaganda. It has also been decided to convene the heads of various districts, district assistants, and compilation and inspection committee members to the county for a Baojia compilation and inspection training meeting starting from November 10.

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Liu Sanhe Oil Mill Fire</p>
<p>The Liu Sanhe Oil Mill in Luoshe Town, Tenth District, is solely owned by Liu Yuqing and is a large-scale operation. Unfortunately, yesterday (the 27th) at around 7:00 PM, the mill's engine room suddenly caught fire due to carelessness. Flames erupted immediately. The local fire brigade rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm. Although the fire brigade made great efforts to extinguish the fire, the blaze spread rapidly. It took an hour to bring the fire under control. In total, the engine room and oil pressing room (with over fifty oil presses) were burned down. More than thirty other buildings were also destroyed. Only a portion of the storefront was spared. The total estimated loss is over 30,000 gold dollars.</p>
<p>Problem of Collecting Business Tax for Out-of-Town Merchants</p>
<p>The various guilds of rice, beans, grains, mountain goods, and other trades in this county recently received a notice to collect business tax for out-of-town merchants through the license system. The original purpose of establishing a brokerage firm was to act as an agent for buying and selling goods. Having already paid the brokerage tax and acknowledging the business tax, the burden feels heavy. If we are required to collect business tax for out-of-town merchants again, it will be like turning rice shops into disguised toll booths, taxing goods directly. This will inevitably deter out-of-town merchants from coming here. Furthermore, the Ministry of Finance has already recognized that the method of collecting business tax by brokerage firms conflicts with the business tax regulations. The Ministry has consulted the Jiangsu Provincial Government, asking it to reorganize the business tax regulations based on the resolutions of the National Financial Conference and to reform them promptly. Why is the county magistrate suddenly ordering this to be done? This not only conflicts with the business tax law but also greatly contradicts the central government's clear orders in the 20th year of the Republic of China to eliminate excessive and harassing taxes. This matter concerns the general welfare. Yesterday, the county chamber of commerce sent letters to the chambers of commerce in Wujin, Wuxian, Kunshan, Wujiang, Jiangyin, Changshu, and other counties to solicit their opinions before jointly petitioning the government. In addition, the silkworm seed guild, regarding the issue of seed prices, telegraphed the Construction Department, requesting appropriate relief.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Reporting the County Magistrate's Opium Addiction</p>
<p>Hospital Director Returns to Province to Report Findings</p>
<p>Magistrate Bao was reported by Mr. Wang Junyi for smoking opium. The Civil Affairs Department dispatched Wang Yuanchen, director of the Provincial Hospital, to Cheng to investigate. After four days, the investigation concluded on the 26th. Whether or not he is addicted to opium will be reported to the province. On the 27th, Director Wang of the hospital returned to the province with the original informant.</p>
<p>Minutes of the Joint Meeting of Private Bus Companies</p>
<p>The Joint Association of Private Long-Distance Bus Companies in Shanghai, Hubei, and Suzhou held its third membership meeting at Zhushi Yiyuan yesterday (the 27th) at 2:00 PM. Twenty-one members attended. Jiang Kesheng chaired the meeting. Twelve important cases were resolved. Key points are recorded below: 1. Regarding the association's previous submission to the competent authorities, requesting regulations on the collection of passenger bus passage fees, it was decided to submit another request to the association. 2. The location of the fourth membership meeting was set in Nanjing. 3. The Zhenyang Company proposed submitting a request to the Provincial Department to instruct all counties and public security bureaus to protect roadside trees. They also suggested requesting the Education Department to order the heads of all county education bureaus and social education organizations to teach primary school students common knowledge about protecting trees. 4. It was decided to submit a request to the Provincial Department to instruct all counties and public security bureaus to strictly prohibit villagers from gathering to stop buses. 5. The Xicheng Company proposed submitting a request to the Provincial Department and Municipal Government to instruct all subordinate governments that, in the event of harm to pedestrians, they should be handled according to the newly revised "Temporary Regulations for the Management of Automobiles in Jiangsu Province" and should not exceed the stipulated penalties. The Standing Committee was tasked with drafting a plan for implementation. 6. The Jiangnan Company proposed submitting a request to the Provincial Department to protect signs obstructing traffic and methods for electric poles. 7. Regarding the re-election of one-third of the executive committee members and supervisory committee members, it was decided that the association's initial six months were a period of establishment, and the term should be extended by another six months to allow for further development of the association's affairs in detail. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM. Regarding the proposed meeting of the Wuxi Yingxicheng Long-Distance Company, it was decided to visit the famous scenic spots around the lake today (the 28th).</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>County Magistrate Requests Another Five Days Leave</p>
<p>Hou Houzong, the magistrate of Wuyi County, was reported during his tenure as magistrate of Yueyang County in Ting Province. He requested leave to return to Hunan Province to thoroughly resolve the matter with the plaintiffs, setting a ten-day limit. Subsequently, because the case could not be concluded on schedule, he requested an extension of five days. Now that the extension has also expired, he is still unable to leave Ting and return to his post. Yesterday (the 27th), Secretary Yang of the county government received an urgent letter from Magistrate Hou, stating that he had separately submitted a request to the Provincial Department for another five days of leave. The county-wide administrative conference, originally scheduled for November 1st, will be postponed to November 10th, when he will co-chair the meeting.</p>
<h3>Haimen</h3>
<p>District Headquarters Thoroughly Investigates the Red Pill Case</p>
<p>Niu Jinhua, a resident of Baziqiao, District 1, was previously reported to the County Public Security Bureau by Shi Chao for selling red pills. The County Bureau dispatched patrol officer Liu Yuting, patrol chief Zhao Zhenhua, and patrol officer Bao Jintang to search his premises and found over thirty red pills. Niu Jinhua and his shop assistant Gao Dingchun were arrested and detained in the county government jail. However, Niu's family claimed that Lin Chao framed him out of spite and petitioned the Nantong District Security Headquarters for a thorough investigation. The district headquarters' military law officer Zhu Bianru came to Hai on the 25th to conduct an on-site investigation. After completing the investigation, he ordered the court police to take the original reporter, Shi Chao, into custody. Military Law Officer Zhu returned to Tong on the same day. Yesterday (the 26th), the county government received an order from the District Security Headquarters to send Niu Jinhua, Gao Dingchun, Shi Chao, Liu Yuting, Zhao Liangyao, and Bao Jintang to Tong for investigation.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Total Amount of County Drought Relief Funds</p>
<p>The County Drought Relief Association has been established for over a month. The internal work has been quite busy recently. The association expects to complete the first phase of investigation next month. It is rumored that the total amount of relief funds planned by the association is approximately 250,000 yuan. The emergency relief portion accounts for about 65%. The association has not yet raised this large sum of funds, and all matters are still being planned.</p>
<p>Two Ship Captains Develop Mental Disorders After Arrest</p>
<p>The two ship captains of the Provincial Defense Fleet, Gu and Liu, were previously arrested by the police command in Zhenping Street for smoking opium while in the province to collect pay. Later, they were sent to the Provincial Rehabilitation Hospital for examination. Yesterday, inquiries were made about the examination process of the ship captains. According to Dr. Zhuang of the hospital, the ship captains were sent to the hospital by the police command on the 19th of this month. After examination, it appeared that both were addicted to opium. However, Captain Liu, due to some stimulation, has developed a mental disorder in the hospital. He is currently receiving neurological treatment. Regarding quitting opium, the process is being temporarily delayed.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Nantong District徵工 Dredges Rivers</p>
<p>The six counties of Tong, Ru, Hai, Qi, Jing, and Chong in the Nantong District have been instructed by the Commissioner's Office to start dredging rivers in November. Provincial, county, team, and group personnel will all participate in the work. Commissioner Zheng Yitong will serve as the general supervisor, directing the operation.</p>
<p>沙洲 Busts Human Trafficking Organization</p>
<p>In Yinyang Shazhou, Ding Changyu, Chen Guangyi, and Yin Laoer colluded with ruffians from Shanghai to set up a human trafficking organization, luring rural women. The Public Security Bureau busted the organization and sent Ding Changyu and others to court. They were interrogated and detained by the Criminal Court on the 27th.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Embezzlement of Funds at the Poor Children's Home</p>
<p>Jin Hengshan, the director of the County Poor Children's Home, was previously summoned to the county government by Magistrate Ma to audit the income and expenditure accounts of the two variety shows and to arrange for the Relief Home to take over the Poor Children's Home. Magistrate Ma has reported this to the Civil Affairs Department for review, stating that Jin Hengshan, the director of the Jiangdu Poor Children's Home, previously stated that due to financial difficulties and a large budget deficit, it was difficult to continue. In order to maintain education and upbringing, he took advantage of the summer vacation to hold four variety shows in the home, performing Peking opera, modern drama, movies, variety acts, national arts, magic, etc., selling tickets to raise funds to compensate for the deficit. He requested approval. At the time, it was considered that raising donations to maintain charitable activities was feasible and was approved. However, rumors later spread that the members of the home were extremely mixed, using the name of charitable fundraising to engage in private business. After investigation, this was found to be true. The Public Security Bureau was immediately ordered to stop the performances, and the home was strictly ordered to report the income received in detail to the newspapers for review. A month later, Jin Hengshan reported that the current variety shows had received a total of 7,416.818 yuan, and after deducting expenses, the net savings were 987.015 yuan. During the review, it was discovered that the third variety show of the home last year had received a total of over 11,000 yuan in cash, but only reported 3,300 yuan. Donations of over 18,000 yuan were spent, but only 14,000 were reported. This was shocking. Either there was embezzlement and exaggeration, or false and excessive expenses were being claimed. The Public Security Bureau was repeatedly ordered to submit the expense receipts for the two variety shows for detailed review. On October 22nd, they finally submitted them completely. On the morning of October 24th, the county magistrate summoned Jin Hengshan and the responsible personnel of the Relief Home to the county government to jointly audit the accounts with the responsible department to ensure caution. Before the audit was completed, Jin Hengshan was detained at the county government to prevent abuses and facilitate the investigation. All duties of the Poor Children's Home are temporarily taken over by Qiang Yunhe, director of the Relief Home, and Guo Lanshi, deputy director.

<p>The Chinese Cotton Mill Association convened a national cotton mill joint meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Regarding the government's plan to increase the unified cotton yarn tax, it was resolved to issue a declaration and elect representatives to go to Beijing to petition. The details are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3>Attending Representatives</h3>
<p>In addition to the representatives of various cotton mills in this port, representatives from Tianjin, Qingdao, Tongzhou, Wuxi, and other places were also present. Such as Shenxin Lu Zanting.

Secretary General Zhang Zemin recorded,</p>
<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>Chairman Guo Shun first reported, briefly stating that in recent years, water droughts and military disasters have flourished, rural areas are almost bankrupt, and the textile industry operated by Chinese people is also increasingly endangered due to the weakness of purchasing power. Coupled with external pressure and labor unrest, there is almost nothing that does not bind our businesses. However, we still strive to forge ahead and constantly work hard, fulfilling our responsibilities as ordinary citizens, extending a vein of ethnic livelihood, and doing our best for the impoverished society. How should the Chinese people cherish this, and how should the government maintain this to weather this difficulty? However, the facts are completely different. The government implemented a unified tax in the 20th year of the Republic of China, suddenly increasing the burden on our industry. The promulgation of the two-level tax rate system gave foreign factories enormous benefits. The association requested corrections, and the documents piled up, and we cried out again and again. The government ultimately failed to make revisions due to various relations. By July 1st of this year, the government revised the customs tariff, reducing the import tax on cotton and other items, causing domestic products to be crowded out by foreign goods, and increasing the import tax on raw cotton, increasing textile costs. Chinese people were all shocked. We rushed around and cried out, but were ultimately unable to change the government's firm decision. Recently, there has been talk of refunding the increased import tax on raw cotton when cotton goods are exported. Our industry is deeply grieved, and we are worried about the great difficulties of the future. Before we could feel at ease, the government recently proposed increasing the unified cotton yarn tax. In this way, we have suffered two major calamities in one year. Even the healthy ones will probably find it difficult to bear. How can our industry, which is on the verge of collapse, endure this? Looking ahead, we tremble with fear. Regarding the proposed increase in the unified cotton yarn tax, the association has repeatedly appealed, hoarse and exhausted. It is difficult to predict the outcome. On October 8th, Director Wu of the Tax Affairs Department informed us that the Ministry of Finance would increase the unified cotton yarn tax. We immediately sent a letter asking Director Wu to politely explain to the Minister to avoid increasing the tax. On the same day, we also sent letters to the Tianjin, Wuxi, and Wuhan associations, asking them to support us. On October 11th, we convened the eighth executive committee meeting and resolved that after receiving replies from various places regarding the increase in the unified tax, we would submit it to the association for public discussion. On October 15th, we received replies from the Tianjin, Wuxi, and Wuhan associations, and each attached a copy of the telegram they sent to the government. On October 16th, we heard that the government was very firm about increasing the tax. Guo Shun. Nie Lusheng. Wang Qizi. Zhang Zemin. met Minister Kong and stated that the industry was in a difficult situation and could not bear further blows. They asked to stop the proposed increase in the unified tax and requested that they find a way to provide relief, but there was no result. On October 17th, the association telegraphed the central government, asking them to avoid increasing the unified cotton yarn tax. On October 18th, we convened the ninth executive committee meeting and resolved to convene a general meeting at the association at 2:00 PM on the 28th of this month, and to publicly decide that the industry has declined to the extreme, and absolutely cannot bear the government's proposed increase in the unified tax. Please the general meeting to jointly discuss the steps to take to save the industry. In addition to notifying the factories, we also telegraphed the Tianjin, Wuxi, and Wuhan associations, asking each factory to send responsible representatives to attend. On October 21st, we heard that the Ministry of Finance planned to submit the plan to increase the unified tax to the administrative meeting on the 23rd. Guo Shun, Tang Xinghai. Zhang Zemin. rushed to Nanjing and petitioned the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Industry, and Chen Jielue. On October 24th, we received a reply from the Ministry of Industry, stating that the transmitted proposal to increase taxes, is it true, and that the matter is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance, and has been requested for reply. Apart from the Ministry of Industry, there were no replies from the others. On October 24th, we received a respectful telegram from the Industry Department of the Ministry of Industry, stating that regarding the cotton yarn unified tax, we received an instruction to send representatives to Beijing for consultations. On October 25th, we convened the tenth executive committee meeting and resolved to first reply to the Ministry of Industry's telegram, stating that we respectfully received the telegram and plan to wait for the Grand Meeting to determine the representatives before going to Hou Shi. Zhang Zemin. was also sent to Beijing on the evening of the 25th as a private individual to inquire about everything. It was learned that the two cases of increasing the unified tax and refunding the foreign cotton import tax had been approved by the administrative meeting and submitted to the Central Political Council for review. On October 27th, we received a telegram from Shandong Lufeng. Chengtong. Renfeng. stating that the factories in Jinan have suffered huge losses in recent years. The main reason is the poor tax system. Your association asked the government to abolish the tax increase and revise the unified tax to a four-level system, which our company fully agrees with. Please firmly advocate, hoping to achieve the goal. This is the process of the association handling this matter.</p>
<h3>Key Points of the Resolution</h3>
<p>It was heard that the meeting discussed the following, one was to elect representatives to go to Beijing to petition帥晚</p>
<p>The number of representatives was set at eight, plus Secretary-General Zhang Zemin, for a total of nine people. At 11:00 PM that night (that is, last night), they chartered a sleeper car to Beijing. In addition to Guo Shun and Nie Lusheng, who were allowed to go to Beijing, the remaining representatives still need to be contacted temporarily. Secondly, it was also resolved to issue a declaration, drafted at the meeting, and immediately sent to the advertising column of each newspaper for publication. The meeting adjourned at half past five.</p>
<h3>Declaration Issued</h3>
<p>The National Chinese Cotton Mill opposes increasing the unified tax, seeking government relief declaration, in recent years, rural bankruptcy, and the yarn industry has declined to the extreme. The nation's cotton mills are facing朝不保幕, and suddenly heard that the government has a proposal to increase the unified cotton yarn tax, which has caused panic among the masses. On the 28th of this month, a general meeting was convened to resolve to unanimously oppose the increase in the unified tax and request government relief in order to maintain the cotton industry, which is dying and to avoid increasing losses. We hereby declare,敬希 all sectors of the country will give assistance, and we are overwhelmed with prayer. National Chinese Cotton Mill Federation,</p>
<h3>Petition</h3>
<p>The petition from Guo Shun and others to Beijing is found below, 謹略者, in recent years, the government has been planning to increase the cotton yarn unified tax again. Before the association, a電 was sent to ask for exemption, but there has been no reply yet. 竊 I national cotton yarn spinning industry, since the implementation of the unified tax, due to the sharp increase in the burden, especially the poor tax rate level, making Chinese merchants in an unfavorable position, it has been declining and is difficult to save. Recently, the customs revised the import tax rate, increasing the import tax on raw cotton, and reducing the import tax on cotton goods, making the Chinese merchant crisis more serious. 詎 The roads are rumored that the government will allow Japanese factories that use the most foreign cotton to refund the increased import tax on foreign cotton when exporting cotton goods. The cost of foreign factories is lighter, and their ability to beat down Chinese factories is even more severe. The Chinese factories are in a very critical moment,正惴票不安, and the saying of increasing the cotton yarn unified tax rises again.顾 The difficulty of the spinning industry is鉴 by the people of the country, and has been appealed to many times in recent years, and the voice is exhausted, and the government, although洞悉民瘼, the sound of relief is also喧騰 in domestic and foreign newspapers, but those who express it, There is almost no one who does not get the opposite. I am afraid that the day when the cotton yarn unified tax is implemented, even if the national factory wants to try to support it, it is impossible.素稔 Your Majesty maintains the industry, without reservation,务恳 Take into account the imminent collapse of the factory industry, do not add to the continuous strain,留 a lifeline for the real industry, that is,保 a share of vitality for the country, think of allowing exemption from the cotton yarn unified tax, and訊 implement urgent and effective relief plans to solve the倒悬, do not任惶悚待命, 謹略</p>

<p>French Envoy</p>
<h3>Can Arrive in Shanghai Next Month</h3>
<p>The Sino-French Agreement Issue Is Expected to Be Resolved</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, French Ambassador to China, Mr. Wei Liding, previously returned to his country on vacation to report to the government of that country on the situation in China and to ask for instructions on the issue of signing the Sino-French Korean-Southern Agreement. Now the vacation has expired. According to diplomatic news, the French envoy immediately departed from Marseilles, France, on a French ship to China and is expected to arrive in Shanghai around the 15th of next month. It is also learned that after arriving in Shanghai, the French envoy will make a brief stay and then proceed to Beijing to meet with our diplomatic authorities and continue consultations on the signing of the Sino-French Vietnam Commercial Treaty. Before the French envoy returned to his country, he consulted with our diplomatic authorities several times on the Sino-French Vietnam Commercial Treaty. Apart from the annexes, which are still to be negotiated, the rest of the opinions on both sides have been consistent. The French envoy's return to his country for instructions can continue the consultations, so it is expected that after several more consultations, this long-standing issue can be resolved.</p>

<p>Jiangsu Finance Department</p>
<h3>Temporarily Suspends the Purchase of Grain</h3>
<p>Due to Gaoyou Merchants Taking the Opportunity to Raise Prices</p>
<p>Will Resume Purchase After Consultation with the Civil Affairs Department</p>
<p>According to the Xinxin News Agency, the Jiangsu Provincial Finance Department, in view of the severe drought and disasters in the counties south of the Yangtze River this year, resulting in a sharp reduction in harvests, while the counties north of the Yangtze River have bumper harvests, borrowed 1.8 million from the Shanghai Jiaotong Peasant Jiangsu and other four banks, and specially sent commissioners with the banks to Gaoyou Shentong and other places to purchase grain and set up ten grain stations to store food for the hundreds of thousands of workers in the guide to sea project. According to the Xinxin News Agency reporter, after the provincial government and banks sent personnel to Gaoyou and other places to purchase grain, the price of grain in that place suddenly rose during the time when the new valley was launched. The biggest reason is that general greedy merchants, when the provincial government sent personnel to purchase, at the same time, the place implemented grain storage in a vault, thinking it was a great opportunity, and raised grain prices without regard to everything in order to make profits. The provincial government has temporarily suspended the purchase. Now the Finance Department is consulting with the Civil Affairs Department on the counties that store grain in warehouses, and should unify the purchase to avoid merchants from arbitrarily raising grain prices. Once there is a plan, the purchase will begin.</p>

<h3>He Yingqin Will Return to Nanjing</h3>
<p>Yesterday Morning, He Talked with Hu Xiyuan at His Residence</p>
<p>Together They Visited the Arpu Electrical Appliance Factory</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, He Yingqin, the Minister of Military Affairs and Chairman of the Beiping Military Branch, has been staying in Shanghai for many days. His intention to go to Hangzhou has now been cancelled. Xie Zhongyuan, the chief secretary of the Ministry of Military Affairs who came with him, told the Xin Sheng News Agency reporter yesterday morning that the minister has completed his business in Shanghai and plans to leave for Nanjing in the next few days to handle ministry affairs. Yesterday morning, He invited Hu Xitu, the general manager of Arpu Electrical Appliance Factory, to meet. Mr. Hu, accompanied by Zhuang Zhihuan, the manager of the factory (former director of the Department of Electrical Affairs of the Ministry of Communications), went to He's residence on Avenue Joffre at about 9 o'clock for a pleasant conversation. Then, at about 10 o'clock, he led He Zongyan and Adjutant Wang Guozhong, along with Mr. Hu and Mr. Zhuang, to the factory on Liaoyang Road for a visit. They were warmly received by Hu, Zhuang, Yu Chongren, the head of the light bulb department, and Li Xinfang, the head of the general affairs section. After visiting the various departments, He expressed his appreciation and personally inscribed "The Pioneer of National Salvation through Industry."</p>
<p>Severance Pay</p>
<h3>Should Be Given Directly to Workers</h3>
<p>And Reported to the Authorities to Send Personnel for Supervision</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau Issued a Public Notice Yesterday</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau issued a notice yesterday stating that in labor-capital dispute cases, those concerning layoffs and business closures, whether resolved through self-reconciliation or mediation, the employer shall pay severance pay according to the law, and all shall be recorded in writing. However, some unscrupulous worker representatives or union representatives fail to distribute the full amount to the workers, or spend it indiscriminately, or embezzle it, so that the workers do not receive actual benefits and are merely tools for unscrupulous representatives. This is extremely hateful. For example, in the recent distribution of subsidies to workers by the Zhenxin and Zhengzheng silk factories, cases of embezzlement were discovered. Although the representatives were arrested and pursued according to the law, it is feared that similar situations still exist, infringing on the workers' due interests. Therefore, a public notice is issued to inform everyone that henceforth, when employers issue severance pay, it should be issued directly to the workers and reported to this bureau to send personnel for supervision and to collect receipts for verification. Workers who are to be laid off are also allowed to come to the bureau at any time to read the records. If they find that the amount received does not match the amount recorded in the records, or if outsiders extort or blackmail under various pretexts, the party concerned may come to the bureau at any time to report it for thorough investigation. This notice is of utmost importance.</p>

<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce and Local Associations</p>
<h3>Jointly Build a Municipal Government Memorial Stele</h3>
<p>To Reverse the Ninety Years of Upside-Down Situation</p>
<p>So That the Greater Shanghai Plan Can Be Controlled by Ourselves</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Municipal Local Association jointly built the seven characters of the city and presented them to the factory. Mr. Hu led the way, and Zhuang Zhihuan accompanied Mr. He as they walked into the factory. Mr. He Yingqin visited the Arpu Factory. The memorial stele for the completion of the new government building has now been completed and erected. The inscription on the stele was written by Sun Lejun and calligraphed by Huang Renzhi. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The establishment of concessions in Shanghai began in the 23rd year of the Daoguang reign of the Qing Dynasty. The area was west of the Huangpu River and south of the Wusong River, which is now known as the central district of the concessions. Later, there were several expansions. In the 25th year of the Guangxu reign, at the request of the British Minister, the northeastern and western parts of the concessions were delineated at the request of the British Minister. Also, the American concession north of the Wusong River was merged into one and renamed the Public Concession. As a result, the territory of the concession was almost six or seven times its original size. The French Concession was also expanded by treaty in the 3rd year of the Republic of China. Since then, the county seat has been surrounded by the two concessions. Those traveling from the northern part of the county to the southern part must pass through the concessions. Previously, when the concessions were expanded in the 25th year of the Guangxu reign, the British had stated that they would no longer make demands in the future. The authorities also feared that the concessions would never end. They independently built roads and set up police in Zhabei to control it. The concessionaires, their northern boundary being blocked by Zhabei, expanded westward, arbitrarily building roads and setting up police. They even planned to incorporate Zhabei and Nanshi into the concessions, moving the county seat to Minhang. In this way, the entire Shanghai situation would fall into international control, and their ambition would be realized. This is the so-called Greater Shanghai Plan. As soon as this proposal came out, the Chinese people were shocked and also planned their own independent plans to resist it. Our country's self-managed municipal administration in Shanghai began with the General Engineering Bureau in the 31st year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty. It was managed by local people and only governed the Nanshi area. Filling rivers and building roads, establishing schools and setting up police, a basic foundation was laid. Zhabei then established a separate General Engineering Bureau to manage it, headed by a Daotai. After the founding of the Republic of China, Nanshi was changed to a Municipal Government, while Zhabei remained the same. In the 3rd year of the Republic of China, self-government was abolished, and two Gongxun Tax Bureaus were established separately in the north and south cities, subordinate to the military commander, with limited funds and divided forces, resulting in little effect. This was followed by the establishment of the Shanghai Commercial Port Supervision Office, with high status and unified authority, but the political situation changed quickly and was not properly restored. The systematic organization and fundamental planning that could rival the two concessions really began with the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Government in the 16th year of the Republic of China. The first mayor was Huang Gongfu, now the chairman of the Beiping Political Affairs Reorganization Committee. He was succeeded by Zhang Gong Dingfan, and then Zhang Gongqun, now the chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government. The current mayor, Wu Gong Tiecheng, took office in January of the 21st year of the Republic of China. At that time, after the fall of the Northeast, national sentiment was strong. Before long, the Japanese suddenly attacked Shanghai. Our army stubbornly defended for three weeks and was forced to abandon the area. The enemy's flames reached the city, and no village was intact. Years of continuous operation were almost destroyed overnight. After the war, tax revenue was short, and the cost of comforting refugees and planning reconstruction was particularly high. The Japanese secretly plotted to observe the situation, and there was even talk of Shanghai becoming a free city. The difficulties and hardships of Wu's tenure were indeed greater than those of the previous mayors. The central area of the city takes Jiangwan as its base point, with the Songhu Railway and the Jinghu Railway to the north and south, making transportation convenient. Its east is connected to the Huangpu River and Wusong, commanding the strategic advantages of water and land, and facilitating the import and export of goods. Moreover, the flat and wide fields are sufficient to relocate a large number of factories and shops, which is not inferior to the one-sided situation of the concessions. Since Zhongshan Road has been built into a large ring, reaching Xiangyin Road from the east of Zhongshan Road, it can directly reach the banks of the Huangpu River. The Huangpu River ferries are lined up one after another, making it like a gateway for those traveling from Puxi to Pudong, commanding the situation of the entire city, which is like a high-rise building overlooking the concessions. If it is properly managed, the labor of reversing the guest-host relationship will gradually be reversed, and the prosperity of Shanghai may be transferred from the hands of foreigners to the hands of the Chinese people. The originator of this proposal was the former mayor, Zhang Gong Dingfan, and Wu actually carried it forward. Once the planning of the city center area is determined, the government offices should be relocated first, so as to determine the people's will and demonstrate leadership. Therefore, the site was relocated, and the design and construction of the municipal government and its affiliated offices began in July of the 19th year and was completed in October of the 22nd year. The municipal government and its various bureaus moved into the new office building in January of the 23rd year. Since ancient times, when government buildings are newly built or renovated, it has been customary to write an article to commemorate them, so as to record the hard work of those who started the matter and prepare for the investigation of the county chronicles. This move is intended to reverse the situation of ninety years of international trade in which the power has been inverted and to make the Greater Shanghai Plan controlled by ourselves. The Shanghai county chronicle should give this matter special attention, and it may also be valued by those who compile the national history in the future. Therefore, the evolution of the concessions is first described to make it clear that those who seek temporary gain are not acting for the long term, and that self-improvement cannot be delayed. Then, the origin of the establishment of the city is described to show that planning and management are not the work of one person. Let those who govern this land in the future be diligent and cautious, and not abandon the predecessors' efforts. As for the beginning and end of the construction project, the municipal government should have a separate record, which is not described in detail.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Xihu Highway, which runs across Jiangsu Province, is 130 kilometers long. Since its construction began, it has been progressing diligently and is about to be completed in its entirety. A reporter from the Central News Agency recently interviewed senior staff of the highway, who gave a detailed account of the highway's recent work progress. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Bridge Engineering</h3>
<p>In addition to the 22 original old bridges on the Xihu Highway (17 in Taicang and 5 in Jiading), a total of 149 new bridges have been built this time. There are 37 bridges in the section from Zhoushanbang in Wuxi to Jiajing in Changshu, which have all been completed. There are 52 bridges in the section from Jiajing in Changshu to Zhitang Town in Taicang, of which 25 have been completed and 27 are still under construction. There are 60 bridges in the section from Zhitang in Taicang to the Shanghai border river, all of which are under construction. All bridge piers along the entire line are constructed with pile frame-style and reinforced concrete pile slab-style, in order to ensure their permanence. The bridge decks are temporarily constructed with foreign pine structures due to limited funding.</p>
<h3>Culvert Engineering</h3>
<p>The newly built culverts along the entire line are divided into two types: reinforced concrete circular pipe type and reinforced concrete cover plate stone masonry square culvert type, totaling 53. The original ones include 13 in Changshu, all of which are iron corrugated pipes, and 17 in Taijia, all of which are reinforced concrete circular pipes. Currently, all 21 culverts in the section from Zhoushanbang in Wuxi to Jiajing in Changshu and all 15 culverts in the section from Jiajing in Changshu to Zhitang Town in Taicang have been completed. As for the 17 culverts in the section from Zhitang Town in Taicang to the Shanghai border river, only 8 have been completed, and the remaining 9 are still under construction.</p>
<h3>Water Pipe Engineering</h3>
<p>All water pipes along the entire line are constructed of circular concrete, totaling 303, excluding those handled by the people at their own expense. There are also more than 260 water pipes built by the Jiangsu Provincial Government, all of which are handled by the counties at their own expense. Currently, all 132 water pipes in the section from Zhoushanbang in Wuxi to Jiajing in Changshu and all 86 water pipes in the section from Jiajing in Changshu to Zhitang Town in Taicang have been completed. As for the 85 water pipes in the section from Zhitang Town in Taicang to the Shanghai border river, only 44 have been completed, and the remaining 41 are still under construction.</p>
<h3>Completion Date</h3>
<p>The Xihu Highway has been progressing almost every day since its construction began, except for rainy days. Currently, most of the bridges and culverts along the entire line have been completed, and the roadbed has also been completed along the entire line. However, some newly completed roadbeds still need to be repaired. It is now possible to drive directly from any station in Wuxi to Sanliqiao in Changshu. It is expected that the entire dirt road will be open to traffic by the end of this year. As for the pavement project, bidding is also being planned. In the bright spring of next year, a new traffic artery will be added to the rich and beautiful area of Jiangnan for vehicles to travel and gallop. The total length of the entire line is 130 kilometers, and the width of the road surface is temporarily set at 5.5 meters, with crushed bricks and crushed stones as the base. The construction method of the surface layer will be improved in stages depending on traffic needs.</p>

<p>Stamp tax</p>
<h3>Branch Heads of Bureaus Telegraphed the Ministry of Finance</h3>
<p>Jiangsu and Zhejiang jointly request the return of deposited stamps</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance promulgated the order to change the national stamp tax, the accumulated stamps in various local branches have not been sold at all, causing great losses. Forty-three branch heads of the stamp tax bureaus in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces jointly telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Tax Bureau the other day (27th), requesting relief to avoid compensation for the stamps. The original telegram is as follows: Minister of Finance Kong, Vice Minister Zou, of Nanjing Finance Department, We, the Bureaus, have reported to the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau after receiving the order to end the term within a limited time, and submitted them to the Ministry to request special consideration. Each provincial bureau requested four points: 1. Return the stamps that were led and stored for cancellation and return cash; 2. Subsidize expenses; 3. Issue severance pay; 4. Extend the deadline for the cut-off to handle the end. Each Bureau in Zhejiang province requested two points: 1. the same as Jiangsu province; 2. give appropriate funding and severance pay. The methods in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are roughly the same for issuing and selling stamps. Therefore, the Bureaus are requesting relief is the same, but many days have passed, and we have not received approval from the Ministry. After investigating all the difficulties, we have already submitted a detailed report, and we will not repeat it here. We only want to say that the cut-off deadline is coming soon. All the stored stamps cannot be sold on the market, and the heads of the branches are not businessmen. These deposited stamps cannot be kept for personal use, and they do not have the capital. Before the end of the term, the bureaus cannot be closed down early, which violates the order, and the salary of the staff is difficult to reduce. How can the heads of the bureaus bear this compensation? As for the severance pay, there are precedents to follow, and the staff handling the stamps are more difficult than other taxes. If they are not given preferential treatment, the staff will be displaced and have unthinkable things to think about. Each branch bureau is in a low position, and they are subordinates of the Ministry. The Ministry reformed the stamps, originally intending to rectify taxation, but the original staff not only lost all protection, but also suffered endless burdens. It seems that we should weigh the situation and avoid unexpected losses, so that both sides can get a fair deal. In summary, these are all the pains of our staff. We must appeal again and again. We sincerely hope that the Ministry can understand and issue an order to give relief quickly. If we do not receive approval from the Ministry by the end of this month, our staff will be forced to delay the cut-off. (Seventeen branch heads of bureaux in Jiangsu, twenty-six branch heads of bureaux in Zhejiang)</p>

<p>Fuxin Flour Mill</p>
<h3>Two Gangs of Laborers Engaged in a Major Brawl</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Natives Gang Was No Match for the Dockworkers</p>
<p>Eight People Were Injured, and More Than Twenty Were Arrested</p>
<p>The Fuxin Flour Mill No. 7 is located on North Suzhou Road, Datong Road, and has warehouses built along the Suzhou River. The loading and unloading of flour bags are all carried out by barges and shouldered by laborers. Therefore, the dockworkers (boatmen) and laborers are gathered there all day long, causing constant disturbances. There is a clear demarcation between the shoulders and the storage of flour bags. For example, when a barge arrives at the shore, the dockworkers do not usually shoulder the bags for the laborers, and when the barge leaves the shore, the laborers do not usually handle the bags for the dockworkers. Yesterday afternoon at about 3 p.m., while the laborers were shoulder-carrying flour, they suddenly quarreled over a minor matter. At first, they cursed each other, and then they started fighting. With a shout, more than a hundred laborers, carrying iron rulers and iron hooks, rushed straight to the dock. Although the dockworkers were fewer in number, only about thirty, they were not willing to show weakness and held bamboo poles and wooden sticks to resist. For a time, there was a great uproar, and the order was greatly disturbed. However, due to the disparity in numbers, the dockworkers were no match for the laborers. Eight of them were injured by the laborers' iron rulers and other weapons. The factory staff shouted to stop them, but to no avail. Fearing a major disaster, they immediately reported to the New Gate Police Station, which dispatched a large number of armed detectives who arrived to see the workers still fighting. They arrested more than twenty of the leading workers first, and the others scattered like birds and beasts. All eight injured dockworkers were lying on the ground. An ambulance was called to send them to Renji and Baolong Hospitals for treatment. The workers who committed the assault were taken to the police station for investigation. As for the injured workers, one named Wu Changsheng, 25 years old, was injured in the head; one named Wu Chunfu, 41 years old, was injured in the chest and head; one named Lü Jinsheng, 25 years old, was injured in the hand and head; one named Xu Jichao, 32 years old, was injured in the head and foot; all were from Jiangbei. One named Zhang Jinyou, 24 years old, from Wuxi, was injured in the chest; one named Ni Tailai, 26 years old, from Chongming, was injured in the face. However, all were slightly injured, so after bandaging, they were discharged from the hospital. There were two others, one named He Axin, from Jiangbei, injured in the head and foot, and one named Hu Youbao, from Jiangbei, 29 years old, injured in the head and chest, who were not discharged from the hospital due to more serious injuries.</p>
<p>Due to water shortage</p>
<h3>Fire at Tangqiao Claims Life</h3>
<p>Grain Store Owner Dies in Inferno</p>
<p>Fire raged from 12:00 AM to Early Morning</p>
<p>Pudong Water Plant Should Begin Operations Soon</p>
<p>At No. 120 Shengjia Lane, east of Tangqiao Road, Pudong, stood the Xinshunxing Grain and Sundries Store, established for two years and with a relatively successful business. The owner, Zhang Guisheng, 49 years old, was a local resident, diligent and thrifty, and meticulously attentive to store affairs. Across from the store were two warehouses used for storing goods. Every night, Zhang slept alone inside to guard the property. Around midnight the day before yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out on the front of the warehouse, for unknown reasons. As it was deep in the night, Zhang was awakened from his sleep. Because the fire was not yet raging, he was able to escape, naked. At that moment, police officer Liu Haiming spotted the flames and rushed over, blowing his whistle to call for help. However, Zhang, feeling embarrassed by his nudity and seeing that the flames had not yet reached the entrance, bravely rushed back in to retrieve his clothes and bedding. Unexpectedly, in that instant, the fire intensified, burning through the doorway, cutting off his escape. The inside was filled with thick smoke, making it impossible for Zhang to find his way out. The fire quickly spread throughout the building, and Zhang perished in the flames. By then, Chief Dong and Inspector Li of the Tangqiao Police Station had also arrived with officers to maintain order. However, as there were no fire hydrants in the area, they could only direct nearby residents to fetch water and help extinguish the blaze. After burning for about an hour, both warehouses were completely destroyed, and the fire gradually subsided. Due to the difficulty in obtaining water, smoldering embers remained until dawn. Chief Dong then ordered people to sift through the burned area and retrieved Zhang's body, which was charred beyond recognition, with skin peeled and flesh torn, a ghastly sight. He immediately instructed the local ward head to request the local court to send officials to examine the body. All the buildings and goods were consumed by the fire, resulting in a loss of over 1,000 yuan. Because the fire started from the outside, many onlookers suspected arson. Furthermore, Zhang was known to be meticulous and not very friendly in his dealings with customers, making it possible that he had made enemies. Therefore, the arson theory was widely believed. The Pudong area is vast, and water supply is difficult. The winter climate is dry, and fire alarms are frequent. Mayor Wu, mindful of the people of Pudong, has instructed the Xingye Trust Company to actively prepare for the construction of a water plant. If water can be supplied soon, fire prevention in Pudong will be much improved.</p>
<p>Public Works Department Forcibly Removes Rickshaw Licenses</p>
<h3>Forcing People to Replace with New Rickshaws</h3>
<p>Rickshaw Merchants Firmly Oppose; Petition Today</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Public Works Department of the International Settlement has repeatedly ignored opposition from rickshaw owners regarding the change to a new rickshaw design. Yesterday, over thirty rickshaw owners, including Zhao Rongfu and Xue Zhengji, had their licenses forcibly removed and were detained by the Public Works Department, which sent detectives to carry out these actions. They were compelled to replace their rickshaws with new ones. The rickshaws have been forcibly stripped of their registration plates, and they are forbidden from continuing to operate.</p>
<p>Request for Rectification: Yesterday at 8:00 PM, over thirty people, including Hou Shaoan and others, attended a meeting of the Rickshaw Guild, chaired by Yin Zhiling. The outcome of the discussion was unanimous agreement that the Public Works Department's action was tantamount to making unreasonable demands. They decided to submit a written request to the Public Works Department for rectification.</p>
<p>Petition Today: According to rickshaw merchant representative Zhao Rongfu, who spoke to a Xin Sheng News Agency reporter yesterday, the Public Works Department is disregarding the facts, showing no concern for the difficulties of merchants, and forcibly removing licenses to force them to replace their rickshaws, which is highly inappropriate. We have decided to petition the Public Works Department tomorrow. Four measures have been determined: (1) We will not accept the authorities' new rickshaw design. (2) Existing rickshaws that still have 10-20% of their life left should be allowed to be used up. (3) The time limit for replacing old rickshaws with new ones should be extended beyond one month, as the time is insufficient. (4) Existing rickshaws should be allowed to be repaired and used.</p>
<p>New Renhe Steamer Tragedy</p>
<h3>Two More Criminals Apprehended</h3>
<p>Two Criminals Returned to the Steamer and Resumed Duties</p>
<p>Arrested After Court Investigation</p>
<p>The New Renhe steamer, owned by the Yuxing Steamer Company of the 16th Pier in the South City, which travels between Shanghai and Qidong, on April 11th of last year, during a trip from Shanghai to Qidong, crew members allegedly tied bean-sized stones to five peddlers, Ma Koubao, Zhou Datong, Mei Laoer, Wei Jinyu, and Shen Xinliang, and threw them into the sea. Later, the families of the five deceased became aware of the situation and secretly reported it to the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau Water Patrol Brigade on the 19th of the same month. When the steamer arrived at the Dada Pier, the ship owner, Sun Xingsheng, and twenty-two others were intercepted and arrested. A document stating, "Sharing blessings and facing difficulties together," was found on the spot. The Shanghai Local Court has been investigating the case, and details have been reported in this newspaper. However, the masterminds and remaining criminals, including the head waiter Li Shouyi and waiter Wang Laoer, and forty-seven others, were still at large. As a result, the court suspended the trial. Unexpectedly, recently, the ship owner, seeing that things had calmed down slightly, rehired Li Shouyi and Wang Laoer to return to the steamer and resume their duties. The court became aware of this, and yesterday, while the steamer was returning from Qidong to Shanghai, the court secretly dispatched several bailiffs to lie in wait at the Dada Pier at 4:00 PM. When the steamer docked, they boarded the ship and arrested Li and Wang. At the time, Li and Wang were still wearing the steamer's specially made uniforms. They were immediately taken into custody by the court to await trial, and orders were issued to continue investigating and apprehending the remaining criminals for legal action.</p>
<p>Longhua Temple</p>
<h3>Dispute Outside of the Litigation</h3>
<p>Forced to Place Advertisement; Fined 50 Yuan</p>
<p>The monk Fangcheng of Longhua Temple previously filed a complaint with the Social Bureau and the Buddhist Association, alleging that the monk Xingkong of Xinchi Temple was negligent in his duties and requesting an investigation and removal, etc. Shortly thereafter, Fangcheng suddenly published a correction in the newspaper, denying that he had filed a complaint. At the same time, Fangcheng also filed a complaint with the Procuratorate of the Local Court, stating that the publication of the correction was not voluntary but was due to coercion and intimidation by the monks Yuanming and Chen Shaodan of the same temple, requesting that they be summoned for questioning. Inspector Zhao Chuanjia investigated the various aspects of the case, as reported in the previous newspaper. It is now known that the investigation concluded that Chen Shaodan obstructed freedom by using violence and coercion to force someone to perform an involuntary act and was fined 50 yuan.</p>

It is reported that after his death yesterday, friends Guo Yicen and Zhang Piaoyuan and others were handling the funeral arrangements. The body will be moved to the China Funeral Home on Hague Road and will be encoffined at 2:00 PM this afternoon.

<p>Remarried Woman Sues Husband for Alimony</p>
<p>Lu Zhou, a woman from Wuxi, 56 years old, resides on Chengdu Road, Xinzha. When she was young, she lost her husband. For the sake of her lifelong happiness, she married Lu Zaishan from Chongming. They have been married for over thirty years and have two daughters. Unexpectedly, Lu Zaishan took a concubine, neglecting Lu Zhou and her daughters. Lu Zhou hired lawyer Yang Wu to request alimony from the local court's mediation court. Her statement was that Lu Zaishan loved his concubine and abandoned his wife, failing to fulfill his support obligations. Their past relationship was all in vain, and he drove out his wife and daughters, neglecting their hunger and cold. She recalled that when he married her, she had considerable private savings, which were all taken away by Lu Zaishan. She demanded that she be paid 25 yuan per month, but beginning this year, she was left destitute. (The purpose of the request) is to pay alimony for twenty years at 25 yuan per month, totaling 6,000 yuan, and return 500 yuan in private expenses and 1,500 yuan in dowry expenses. Yesterday, Judge Xiong Nianpeng specially opened the Second Court for mediation. Lawyer Yang Dong represented the plaintiff and attended court, presenting Lu Zaishan's handwritten certificate issued in 1932 and lawyer Wu Zhiping's certification contract, etc. Lu Zaishan denied everything. The judge deemed the mediation unsuccessful and instructed lawyer Yang to file a formal lawsuit before adjourning the court.</p>

When the matter was not successful, the French Public Works Department found out and reported it to the French police, who dispatched detectives to arrest Liu, Wu, Wang, Zhang, and others and sent them to the First Special Court. The police lawyer prosecuted them for fraud. The trial resulted in Liu Bin and Wu Dongchu being sentenced to eight months in prison and fined 200 yuan for continuous fraud. Wang Fuyun and Zhang A'er were sentenced to four months in prison and fined 100 yuan each for assisting in the fraud, with a two-year suspended sentence.

<h3>Pan Rongfu Sues Zhou Xizhong for Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Dispute Over Unpaid Wages for Undertaken Housing Construction</p>
<p>Pan Rongfu, a Ningbo native and owner of the Pan Rongji Construction Factory, was commissioned by the China Industries Trust Company on February 22nd of last year to construct apartment buildings on Xiting Road. Zhou Xizhong, residing at No. 33, Lane 299, Xibin Road, was the general manager of the project. The construction costs were received in installments, with Li Jinpei, the architect from China Industries Company, issuing payment certificates to Pan, who then instructed Zhou to take the certificates to China Industries Company to collect the funds. Zhou collected over 310,000 taels in total without any shortages. On August 31st of this year, Li Jinpei issued another payment certificate for 8,200 yuan. Pan signed the receipt and handed it to Zhou for collection. However, after a considerable time, Zhou failed to deliver the funds to Pan. Upon inquiry, Zhou claimed he had not yet received the funds and then began avoiding Pan. Pan inquired with China Industries Company and discovered that Zhou had already received the funds. Pan, therefore, considered it embezzlement and hired lawyer Yuan Yang'an to sue Zhou in the First Special Court's Criminal Division, requesting prosecution under Article 357, Section 1 of the Criminal Law, and filed an ancillary civil suit seeking compensation of 8,200 yuan. The day before yesterday afternoon, presiding judge Wu Zehan held a hearing in the Second Criminal Court. Zhou Xizhong also hired lawyer Chen Lingxi for his defense. Zhou argued that he had received over 300,000 yuan and had never been short. He claimed that after receiving the 8,200 yuan, he had already delivered it to the plaintiff, and that the plaintiff had subsequently asked him to collect more funds. If he had indeed embezzled the 8,200 yuan, why would the plaintiff continue to trust him and ask him to collect funds? Therefore, the plaintiff's accusations were entirely false, and he should file a counterclaim. Pan denied receiving the 8,200 yuan. The court stated that further investigation was needed and ordered a rescheduled hearing. Zhou provided a guarantor for continued attendance. Lawyer Chen requested that, pending finding a guarantor, Zhou be released under his guarantee, which the court granted.</p>

<h3>Song-Han Piloting Dispute</h3>
<p>Since the customs authorities took charge of Song-Han piloting and promulgated new regulations restricting the original piloting and customs clearance services of Chinese pilots, it has stirred up a storm of opposition from shipping merchants and pilots, which has lasted for nearly a month. The two sides are only holding on, and there is a great intention to develop urgently. There have been new developments yesterday, and the details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Refusal to Clear Customs　The pilots recruited by the customs this time number about fifty. They are accommodated by the Shanghai Pilot Management Committee to prepare for guiding ships entering and leaving the Yangtze River. Since the establishment of the committee, Chinese and foreign shipping merchants have unanimously opposed the newly added pilotage fee as being too expensive and insisted on not using it. As a result, the committee's pilots have been idle all day long without any business. As a result, the customs took another step and promoted the method of not clearing customs for pilots who are not members of the committee.</p>
<p>Foreign Merchants Oppose　Since the customs did not clear customs, most of the pilots were very embarrassed, and their livelihoods were greatly affected. The public was outraged and was discussing countermeasures. Yesterday, two Norwegian ships represented by the Japanese firm Datong Company and the Moller and other ships of the British firm Messrs. Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co., Ltd. were sailing to Hankou and took the initiative to hire pilots. The customs implemented the method of not allowing customs clearance. The managers of the two companies were greatly angered by this blow. They said that the pilots they sent had served for more than ten years and held licenses from the Chinese Ministry of the Navy. They went to the customs in person to question them and stated that they would never favor the pilotage committee's pilots. If they were forced to do so, they would use foreign pilots instead, but the higher pilotage fee of several hundred yuan would have to be compensated by the customs. As a result of the dispute, the customs authorities relented, allowing one of Jardine Matheson's two ships to clear customs, and another method was discussed for the other. Datong Company's Norwegian ship changed to Japanese pilots.</p>
<p>Pilots Question　Although the issue of customs clearance for foreign ships has temporarily come to an end, the long-term pilots believe that the business of Datong Company has always been handled by Chinese, but now it has been destroyed by the customs and occupied by foreigners. All the pilots refused to accept it and rushed to the customs, sending representatives to question Ke Feier, the director of the pilotage committee, about his authority to hold examinations, cancel the licenses of the Ministry of the Navy held by long-term pilots, arbitrarily specialize, and bully Chinese. What kind of power was given to him? Ke Feier was speechless, stammered, and could not get any important information. Later, the water police heard the news and came to the scene to mediate, fortunately no accident occurred.</p>
<p>Shipping Association Expresses　After the pilots withdrew from the customs, they went to the Shipping Association on Wuma Road to petition. At that time, the association was holding a meeting and heard that it would issue a statement that the Shipping Association would never recognize the pilotage fee set by the customs. The association is in the position of shipowners, and all legal pilots who hold licenses from the Ministry of the Navy and have service records have the right to employ them freely. The association is very willing to help against the customs' suppression of Chinese pilots and will oppose it to the end. The final step is to stop sailing and fight for it.</p>

The association received 990 yuan in relief funds last week. After the report was completed, various proposals were discussed. 1. The association's finance team has a lot of work to do. Should the finance team members be notified to come to the meeting every day to handle the case? Resolved, passed, and Liu Wanqing committee member was recommended to contact the finance team Du Xiangqing, Mei Huanhou, and Lu Xingjie. 2. Committee member Guan Jiongzhi resigned from raising funds due to busy affairs. How should the release of funds be handled carefully in the future so that the fundraising will not be in vain? Resolved and passed. At present, on the one hand, the association will send letters to urge the fundraisers to send the raised funds to the association as soon as possible. Then the association will decide on the release method based on the amount of funds raised. On the other hand, the finance team will comprehensively analyze the disaster reports from various places and strictly determine the severity of the disaster in each county. 4.

<h3>No Morphine Found in White Powder</h3>
<p>Li Yushan and Others Released</p>
<p>Huang Kuanqi and Others Prosecuted for Violations</p>

They were suspicious and took them into custody. Upon opening the packages, they found white fine powder, which they believed to be heroin. They learned that it was given to them by Zhao Gen, a fellow villager living at No. 360, Lane, Wuchang Road, to be sold in Guangdong, Hong Kong, and other places. They rushed to the indicated location and arrested Cantonese woman Huang Kuanqi downstairs, and searched the same white powder from the wardrobe upstairs, totaling more than 40 pounds, and a can of hundreds of red pills. Huang stated that these pills were the property of Wang Bing, a fellow villager. The house was rented by Cantonese Li Neng. Zhao Gen and Li Neng arrived successively and were also arrested and taken to the patrol division together with the pills, detained separately, and sent to the First Special District Court the next day. According to Li Kangshan and Huang Bang, they were both sailors and did not know what the meat was. Zhao Gen gave it to them. Huang Kuanqi, a woman, stated that this white powder was sent by Wang Bing's tea servant and placed in the attic. Zhao Gen stated that the white powder was given to Li Kangshan and Huang Bang by Li Neng to be taken to Hong Kong. The fee was five yuan for a large package and two and a half yuan for a small package to treat stomach disease. Li Neng stated that algae powder was Wang Bing's property, and he asked about it in the spring of this year. He took it to other ports and Hong Kong only three or four times. Upon receiving the instructions, he was detained for further verification. Yesterday, Judge Wu Zelian attended the trial. Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the Engineering Bureau, stated that during the rescheduling, the doctor verified that the powder did not contain morphine or heroin. Therefore, Li Boshan, Wang Bang, and Zhao Gen were not prosecuted and asked to be released. Huang Kuanqi and Li Neng should be transferred to a summary trial for crimes of distant prohibition. The court approved.</p>

He often came to Feng's house to chat, and eventually became involved with Chen. The affair could not last long. Two years ago, when her husband was away, she eloped with Xu. When Feng returned home and saw that his family was empty, he knew something had happened and reported the case to the police. However, for two years, there was no trace. Until the day before yesterday, Feng learned that Chen and Xu had rented a house at No. 19, Huaiyu Fang, East-West Huade Road, and were living together. She had also given birth to a child. He reported to the Huishan Patrol Division.

Unexpectedly, Feng Mingshan suddenly recalled the previous situation and expressed his unwillingness to prosecute her. She also stated that she was willing to repent and completely change her past mistakes and return home with her husband. However, she said that the five-month-old child had no one to entrust to. She requested that Xu also be released so that the child could be handed over to Xu. Feng agreed to withdraw the prosecution. The court held that this case was subject to prosecution, and since Feng expressed his unwillingness to prosecute, it was ruled that it would not be accepted. However, Xu was sentenced to a fine of ten yuan as a warning for the crime of eating opium.</p>

<h3>Impression of Suiyuan (3)</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhenhua.</p>
<h3>The Political Center of the Three Inner Mongolia – Bailing Temple</h3>
<p>Bailing Temple, originally named Hongli Temple, is a mispronunciation of the Chinese sound. The temple is located 270 li north of Wuchuan County and 360 li from Guihua City. There are over 200 buildings, all in the Tibetan style with square flat roofs, majestic and well-placed Buddhist palaces and pagodas. It was built during the Kangxi period with funds from the imperial treasury. The temple property covers four li in circumference and has nine mountain passes, all extremely strategic. There are three major transportation routes: east to Xilin Gol League, north to Outer Mongolia, and northwest to Xinjiang and Tibet. In front of the temple is a small river called Harhong River. In the second year of the Republic of China, Zhang Shaozeng and the Outer Mongolian general Yiluo faced off at Bailing Temple, with the east and west sides of the river as the battle lines. After Yiluo was defeated, he invaded again in the seventh year of the Republic of China, and Cai Qiyang led troops to defeat him again. In that battle, part of Bailing Temple was destroyed, and later rebuilt. Currently, there are over a thousand lamas in the temple. To the east of the temple, on a hillside, are dozens of Mongolian yurts, which serve as the office of the Local Autonomy Political Affairs Committee. According to the organization of the Political Affairs Committee, there are 28 members, divided into two halls and four departments, and an independent committee. The two halls are the Secretariat Hall and the Counselor Hall. The Secretariat Hall is further divided into four groups, and the Counselor Hall is divided into four sections. The four departments are Civil Affairs, Industry, Education, and Security. The independent committee is the Finance Committee, specializing in finance. The current chairman of the committee is Yun Wang, the Zheng League leader of Shiling Chabu League, and the vice-chairmen are Sha Wang and Suo Wang. However, Yun Wang, Sha Wang, and Suo Wang are all old-fashioned Mongolian princes, stubborn and unaware of the big picture. Although Yun Wang is nominally stationed in Bailing Temple for office work, in reality, he spends his days in the yurt drinking milk tea, sniffing snuff, and chanting Buddhist scriptures, completely oblivious to everything. All the power is in the hands of the secretary-general, Dezhi. De Wang, whose name is Demchugdongrub, is the Zhasake Heshuo Duling Qin Wang of the Right Banner of Sunite, and also the vice-leader of Xilin Gol League. Young and handsome, he is fluent in English, French, and Japanese, and also speaks fluent Chinese. He is highly respected by the Mongolian people. The Political Affairs Committee is a new organization based on central government laws. Under each prince's banner, the old system is still followed. The ranks of princes are, from smallest to largest: Gong, Beizi (above Gong), Beile (above Beizi), and Wang. Wang is divided into Jun Wang (Prince of the Commandery) and Qin Wang (Prince of the Blood), with Qin Wang being higher than Jun Wang. However, the common Mongolian people refer to all princes, large and small, as Wangye (Lord Prince). As for their administrative organization, the highest level is the League, and the League is divided into Banners. The Right Banner has a higher position than the Left Banner and can sometimes command it. The League has one League Leader, one Deputy League Leader, and three League Chancellors, elected by the Banners to handle the affairs of the entire League and supervise its subordinates. Each Banner has one Zhasake (Banner Leader), who handles the affairs of the entire Banner. This position is hereditary. Under the Zhasake, there are two assistants, one for the east and one for the west, to assist the Zhasake in handling Banner affairs. Below them is one Guanqi Zhangjing (Banner Affairs Officer), who takes orders from the Zhasake and the east and west assistants to handle affairs. Below the Zhangjing, there are two Meiren (also assistants), one for the east and one for the west. Further down, there are officers such as Canling (Battalion Commander), Zuoling (Company Commander), Xiaoqixiao (Cavalry Captain), and Lingcui (Sergeant) to handle local affairs. Each Banner has an administrative office, called "Heishao Sha" (transliteration) in Mongolian. Officials serve completely voluntarily, without pay. Each official only serves for four months a year, and during the remaining time, they can engage in private business. Taking the Heishao Sha of one Banner as an example, the daily officers in charge are the Guanqi Zhangjing in the first, fourth, seventh, and tenth months; the East Meiren in the second, fifth, eighth, and eleventh months; and the West Meiren in the third, sixth, ninth, and twelfth months. The lower-level officials, such as secretaries, messengers, and general affairs officers, also have three people in each office, serving in rotation. The Mongolian Banner princes are somewhat similar to the monarchs of constitutional monarchies. Although their position is supreme, their powers are quite limited. The wooden box storing the seals of the Banner has three locks, one held by the Zhasake and one each by the east and west assistants. It cannot be opened unless all three agree. However, although the old system still exists in the Inner Mongolian Banners, they can accept and obey the new policies of the Political Affairs Committee. The Political Affairs Committee's expenses are covered by a monthly subsidy of 30,000 yuan from the central government, with the remainder allocated by the Banners. The yurts of the office are also donated by the Banners. As for the military, the Political Affairs Committee does not have a directly subordinate infantry. The Mongolian people practice a conscription system. All men between the ages of 18 and 50 are obligated to serve in the military. The military was previously under the command of each Banner and was called the Guerilla Force. It is now renamed the Security Force. The two Leagues of Suiyuan and the thirteen Banners have a total of 5,000 Mongolian soldiers, with the Zhungeer and two other Banners having the most, accounting for one-fifth. Currently, there are 200-300 troops stationed in Bailing Temple, dispatched from various Banners, one to protect the Political Affairs Committee, and the other to have the troops receive modern training. The Political Affairs Committee was established not long ago, but it is making every effort to operate. De Wang and his subordinates are all very serious in their work. The market in Bailing Temple is also gradually becoming prosperous. To the east of the Harhong River, there are already more than 50 Han Chinese merchants with a population of 500. The post office was also established on May 1st of this year. However, the lifestyles, languages, and writing systems of the Han Chinese and Mongolian people are very different, and there is some estrangement between them. They often kill each other over trivial matters. In addition, the Mongolian people have shallow knowledge and mostly do not understand the organization of the Republic of China. Since the establishment of the Local Autonomy Political Affairs Committee, they have further misunderstood the word "autonomy," thinking that they have their own political center and not knowing what the central government is. These situations are not good phenomena. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Reconciliation After a Drifting Life, Pitying the Young Girl's Wish to Hear of Hardship, Yu Visits a Poor Home</p>
<p>When Sister-in-law Hu heard him say he would go, she was overjoyed and led the way. As soon as she entered his door, she shouted, "Look, the old master of our Little Western Paradise is here!" Although Zhiqian didn't want her to shout like that, he couldn't stop her. As he walked into the middle of the courtyard, an indescribable stench assaulted him, and he took two steps back, holding his nose. Sister-in-law Hu seemed to understand and immediately waved her hands, chasing the chickens in the yard to the back. Amidst her shouting at the chickens, two women came out of a small house on the left, one old and one young, each holding a piece of grey brick in their hands, which they constantly put in their mouths to chew. This was the so-called "clay brick." Sister-in-law Hu turned around and saw him paying close attention, and said with a smile, "We have them at our house too. Since we have a guest, come out and help us entertain him!" As she said this, she suddenly looked towards the earthen house. Then an old lady came out, holding a small, low stool in both hands, placed it in the middle of the courtyard, and said with her head lowered, "Please sit down, sir." After she finished speaking, she couldn't stand steady and swayed backwards. Fortunately, she was only two steps away from the earthen stove, and she quickly grabbed the corner of the stove to support herself. When Zhiqian looked at her feet, they were as small as old water caltrops. It was no wonder she was falling forward and backward, relying on those two old water caltrops to support her entire body. It was too unbearable to have such a person come out to entertain him, so he said, "There's no need to fuss. I'm just here to see how poor people live." (51)</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Nai Ling)</p>
<p>September 18th, needless to say, is a day of shame for our China, but this year's September 18th coincided with the Soviet Union joining the League of Nations, and many countries in Europe showed smiles. October 10th, needless to say, is a day of joy for our China, but this year's October 10th coincided with the tragic assassination of the King of Yugoslavia and the French Foreign Minister, and many countries in Europe wore mourning faces. One sadness versus one joy, one joy versus one sadness, it's truly a skillful coincidence!</p>
<h3>Fragrant Records of the Imperial Palace</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Even in several larger gaps, many small trees had already grown. In a few more years, I don't know what it will become. I think the original situation must have been very different from the current one!</p>
<p>I can't say that I have any special fondness for this imperial city. Although, according to history, our ancestors originally flourished on this piece of land, we should perhaps have a different feeling for it. However, these events happened too long ago, making it difficult for us to have any impression. Moreover, we have lived in the Central Plains, with its different scenery, for so many years, and it has almost become our second hometown. Everything is very familiar to us there, but here, on the contrary, it feels unfamiliar! I think that if our ancestors were to come out of the ground and meet us at this time, we would not have any feelings other than greeting them with the courtesy we would show to strangers.</p>
<p>It is naturally not easy to clearly see such a great and lively comedy. I think it would be best to sit in an airplane and look down, like a bird's-eye view, so that one could see everything at a glance. However, at that time, China had not yet had any trace of such a thing as an airplane! Even if there were, I could not, as a female official, fly an airplane and secretly observe the imperial procession in the sky. Fortunately, I am now in a sedan chair, which is also a high vantage point, allowing me to see everything I want to see. At that time, the most striking thing was the two rows of fully armed banner soldiers, each prostrating on the ground like a toad, with their heads lowered so much that their lips almost touched the dirt. In front of them were the two rows of officials who had been rushed in to greet the emperor. (161)</p>
<h3>Cranes in Huating</h3>
<p>— Jin Xiong Yu</p>
<p>According to my friend Mr. Wang from Songjiang, the cranes produced in Yangzhou are the best. The male cranes chirp upwind, and the female cranes chirp downwind (Mozi). Although cranes often chirp at night, the whole world trembles, knowing that crane chirping is mostly at midnight. The Huainanzi also says: Chickens know when it is about to dawn, and cranes know when it is midnight. Their voices interact and conceive, and when people peek at them at the time of the Maoshi (5-7 AM), they peck and break the eggs. They live very long, hence the saying "crane longevity of a thousand years." They fly high and far, and they are also good at dancing (Hanfeizi Collection). When Master Kuang played the qin for the first time, two groups of sixteen black cranes came to gather. When he played again, they lined up. When he played a third time, they stretched their necks and chirped, spreading their wings and dancing. Therefore, wealthy and powerful families keep them, and if they are kept in a garden, it must be near water and bamboo, and they must be fed. You must prepare the trouble of earthworms, fish, and grains. If they are fed hot food, their feathers will become muddy and dull.</p>
<p>The saying about the Crane Nest in Huating has been around for a long time. According to research, Crane Nest Village is now Xiasha. According to the biographies, it is said that cranes are produced in Huating. However, Crane Nest Village, without deep forests and secluded desires, where can they gather? Only according to local people's rumors: In the past, a pair of white cranes flew from the East Sea and rested on an ancient cypress tree. After a long time, they gave birth to chicks and flew away together into the sky. Many years later, two cranes came again, wandering between villages, sometimes resting on the treetops, sometimes sleeping in the fields. When the villagers gathered to watch, they stretched their necks and chirped loudly, walking freely. Their voices were loud and clear, reaching more than twenty li away. Their feathers were like snow, with red heads and black tails, and their feet were more than two feet tall. After a few days, they spread their wings and soared into the sky, disappearing into the mist, suspected to be the previous crane chicks. Since then, cranes often come, so it is said to be a product of Huating. But in recent years, they have gone and never returned.</p>
<h3>Female Physiognomist by Touji Bridge</h3>
<p>— Zhang Huang</p>
<p>The talk of fate and physiognomy is rejected by the new academic world, but those who practice it are increasing. Chinese people are rich in a mentality of luck, and those who are interested in it are really numerous. Intellectuals even assist it as a philosophy inherent to our country. Therefore, there are lowly men who, seeing the rise of women's occupations, dress up young girls and entrust them with this profession, teaching them clever words and flattering expressions, going back and forth to inns and taverns, living as rare goods, indulging in sweaty deeds, inheriting and monopolizing, and directing as if certain. Alas! Working as a bridal gown for others, all are mournful geese, a puppet life, how can a mother not be disappointed! However, within ten steps, there must be fragrant grass. There is someone here who can be described.</p>
<p>There is a female physiognomist named Cang Xiaohong, who appears at dusk south of Touji Bridge on Zhejiang Road, in an open space between city houses, with the sky as her curtain and the ground as her seat: a table, a chair, a pen, inkstone, and books, the tools needed for her profession, with nothing else. Touji Bridge, some seek elegance and change the characters to Touji Bridge, in addition to showing people the good omen of revealing heavenly secrets, the physiognomist practices here. It is impossible to imitate! This female physiognomist also handles fortune-telling, taking payment of only two small silver coins, which is within the means of the middle and lower classes. Moreover, her location is close to the crossroads, so those who come to her as soon as she sets up her pen and ink are like the first!</p>
<p>I have repeatedly heard of the accuracy of her art, and I once went to observe her: in the core of the human chariot. The female physiognomist sits in the middle, speaking with generosity and gesturing incessantly. She looks to be over thirty years old, with a face that shows the wear and tear of travel. Her clothes are tattered, quite like a famous scholar. Her bowing and raising of her head, and the way she speaks, completely avoids any womanly affectation. Whoever asks about their fate, she writes a paper for them, wielding her brush quickly, her handwriting bold like her person. Her words are concise and not verbose, and the guests often smile and understand. According to her own description, "In the government, in the store, I have sometimes had the opportunity to be there, but looking up at people, I am rarely not seen as a vase, ridiculed at will. Taking money and suffering grievance, are we happy to do it? Although my profession is lowly, wandering the world, but the transaction is retreated, the heart is at peace, much more than those!" "A person without a skill, wanting to live in the world, can only be subject to the slaughter of others!"</p>
<p>I retired and thought about it, this person is insightful, perhaps having come from suffering, and taking pleasure in being able to support herself. Although her work may not necessarily benefit the world, her attitude is bright, a rare sight among women, worthy of respect. Her literary skill is unmatched by other female physiognomists, and I still have room to write about her. Happy to write this record for her.</p>
<h3>When the Reed Flowers are White</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>Stepping onto the dike of my hometown, it's the time when the reed flowers are white again.</p>
<p>It hasn't faded from my memory, that last year at this time, I went with my uncle to catch crabs on the beach. At dusk, the bright light coated the reed flowers along the beach with silver white, contrasting with the vast river and sky in the background. Two black shadows quietly went down to the beach from the high dike, the tall and thin one was myself, and the short and stout one was my uncle.</p>
<p>The two of us rolled up our trouser legs, parted the withered and scorched reed stalks and leaves, and ran into the deep forest. My uncle turned on the mast light in his hand, shining it towards the water. He squatted quietly, so experienced, holding back his chronic cough. I'm an impatient person, why don't I see any crabs coming ashore yet? That question was always rejected by my uncle's look. I'm not used to this life of a crab catcher.</p>
<p>Gradually, a squeaking and scratching sound came from the water, the crab swarm had been lured up by the mast light.</p>
<p>Then I became happy again, calmly catching the crabs that crawled closer into the cage. When I caught a pair of small ones, my uncle told me to throw them back into the water, saying to let them grow bigger. I thought in my heart: this is just delaying their lives. Sooner or later, aren't they still prisoners in the crab cage! However, in the minds of most crab catchers, it's not to release the small crabs, but for the sake of their own future greater benefits.</p>
<p>Before dusk arrived, we had caught a full cage.</p>
<p>Then we carried the full crab cage and the mast light whose kerosene was used up, and went back in the cold white moonlight. I walked in front of my uncle, and he would occasionally tell me about the continuously declining life in the countryside in recent years. If the countryside becomes like the crab swarms, the vast people will sometimes be deceived by some light.</p>
<p>My uncle was indeed deceived by this kind of light and lost his life.</p>
<p>Now, everything is still the same, the high dike, the shallow beach, the crippled season's wind blowing the heads of the reeds white. The crabs in the water full of reed flowers have grown up again, the scenery of my hometown will never make me forget. What about my uncle's voice and appearance? No! Standing on the long dike of my hometown, I sadly gaze at the geese formation, long chirping as they fly across the sky.</p>
<p>Little Common Sense</p>
<h3>On Poison Gas</h3>
<p>— Bing Yu</p>
<p>Since the advancement of science, modern internal warfare is vastly different from the past. In particular, the release of poison gas in chemical warfare is chilling to contemplate. During the First European War, the German army used poison gas against the Allied forces. At that time, 150,000 Allied soldiers were poisoned, of whom 5,000 died. Even those who were rescued suffered severe toxic damage, with some becoming disabled and others developing permanent chronic illnesses. From a humanitarian perspective, it is extremely cruel. Now, let's explain the origin and types of poison gas separately. The origin of poison gas dates back to 1870 when a German pharmacist created it. He said that if a certain type of "bitter essence" medicine was placed in a bomb, it could weaken the enemy's fighting power. However, scholars at the time did not believe him. Later, when the war broke out, after more than 40 years of research, there was significant progress. The German army was the first to test it. However, at that time, sending poison gas to the enemy was done by using air pumps to release the poison, or by war vehicles rushing into enemy positions to disperse it, or by mixing it into bullets and firing them, or by scattering it from airplanes. Later, due to the development of airplanes, the aerial attack of poison gas became unimaginable. Therefore, the air defense drills of various countries focused on the protection and rescue from poison gas. As for the effects of poison gas on physiology, it is divided into five types: 1. Asphyxiant, 2. Blistering agent, 3. Lachrymatory agent, 4. Sternutatory agent, 5. Poisoning agent, and 6. Malodorous agent. However, some poison gases contain two or more properties. The asphyxiant poison gas is made from raw materials such as chlorine, bromine, phosgene, and diphosgene. If we inhale this gas, our lungs will immediately develop edema, making it impossible to breathe, leading to suffocation and death. Chlorine is a yellow-green transparent gas. After being released, it absorbs the temperature in the air and turns into a white, dense fog. Bromine is a reddish-brown gas, but phosgene is a colorless and transparent gas, which is a liquid. Once released, it immediately vaporizes, turning into white mist at 8 degrees Celsius. Diphosgene is the same, but slightly bluish. 2. Blistering agent poison gas is a mixture of yperite and lewisite. It exists as both a gas and a liquid. If our skin comes into contact with this poison gas, it will immediately ulcerate, similar to the properties of nitric acid. If we inhale this poisonous gas, it can cause pneumonia in mild cases and death in severe cases. When the German army released this poison gas in the trenches, the Allied soldiers abandoned their weapons and fell to the ground and died. Later, an Allied doctor invented a detoxification method, which is to use "salol" powder to disinfect. If you are poisoned, apply salol powder to your body, and the inhaled poison will be dispersed from the skin through bleeding. 3. Lachrymatory agent. Coming into contact with this type of poison gas will immediately cause tears and blurred vision. This is what the American police usually use to capture thieves. Its raw materials are a mixture of picryl chloride, bromoacetone, and ethyldichloroarsine. If you are exposed to this poisonous gas on the battlefield, you will naturally not be able to open your eyes and will be easily captured. 4. Sternutatory agent. Inhaling this type of poison gas will cause a very sore throat, and it will immediately turn into tracheobronchitis, causing severe coughing because it is a mixture of diphenylchloroarsine, diphenycyanoarsine, Adamsite, and xylyl bromide. Therefore, it causes great obstacles to breathing. 5. Poisoning agent. This type of poison gas is a mixture of hydrocyanic acid and carbon monoxide. If it touches the central nervous system, it will immediately paralyze it. If it touches the blood, it will cause poisoning and death. However, in quantities below the determined level, it will not cause harm to the body. 6. Malodorous agent. This is a newly invented agent. In October of this year, during the International Chemical Association conference, Dr. Keed of the Yuasym Company of New York discovered it while researching the reaction of waste fees at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Its characteristic is that if you inhale a small amount of the poisonous gas, you will cough violently. If you inhale a concentrated amount of the poisonous gas, your lungs will immediately rupture. Its chemical formula is similar to that of phosgene. Recently, the situation between Japan and Russia has become tense. Russia is working hard to research chemical weapons. This month, it sent a meteorological observation team to establish observation stations in important cities on the Russian-Manchurian border to study the relationship between air currents and the use of poison gas after the start of the war. At the same time, it is connecting various observation stations along the Chinese Eastern Railway for aviation experiments. Therefore, if war breaks out in the future, all of humanity will inevitably suffer unimaginable misfortune.</p>

<h3>Competition Details</h3>
<p>The athletes arrived in the downtown area before 8:30 AM, resting in the municipal government cafeteria or trying out their feet on the track. The weather was sunny, and there were over a thousand spectators from all walks of life. In front of the municipal government auditorium, a flag of the First Shanghai District Race Walking Meet was hung horizontally. Prizes were displayed on the stone steps, a dazzling array.

A total of 104 people started, and 92 reached the finish line. Eleven were disqualified. Twenty were selected.

<h3>Eleven People Disqualified</h3>
<p>A total of 107 people signed up for this race walking event, and 104 started. Wen Ruquan had led within the first 1,000 meters, but was overtaken by Cai Zhengyi, who led all the way to the finish line, about 500 meters ahead of second place Zheng Chengshan. A total of 92 people reached the finish line, of which 11 were disqualified for violating the rules. It is a pity that Zhang Xianlun in ninth place, Lu Zhiyuan in tenth place, and Xue Peisheng in nineteenth place were among them.</p>
<h3>Cai Zhengyi is a Talented Individual</h3>
<p>Mr. Cai is 22 years old, a local, and currently studies at the private Yuqing Middle School. He won the championship in the previous 13-mile Chinese Open Race Walking and the 15-mile International Race Walking. He also won second place in the 5,000-meter race walking event at last year's National Games. Judging by his calm demeanor and consistent stride, he is a good race walking general.</p>
<h3>Ge Jingkang is Noble in His Old Age</h3>
<p>The most eye-catching among the hundred athletes yesterday was the elderly Ge Jingkang. The words "elderly" were affixed to his sports uniform. Ge is already 49 years old, but his spirit is quite strong. He participated in the last International Race Walking Meet, which is truly rare.</p>
<h3>Asphalt Road Increases Speed</h3>
<p>The result of this race walking meet, 23 minutes, 34 and 8/10 seconds, was beyond our expectations, and also an improvement over the performance at the National Games. The reason is that this time it was held in the downtown area, where the asphalt road has less resistance than the ordinary cinder road, increasing the speed. Moreover, they were all straight lines, with only four turns. This also made the results better.</p>
<p>Chen Baoqiu Breaks</p>
<h3>National Shot Put Record in Hankou</h3>
<p>Record is 12.765 Meters</p>
<p>Hankou Municipal Games Close Yesterday</p>
<p>All Records at the Hankou Municipal Games Shattered</p>
<p>(Hankou, 28th) The Hankou Municipal Middle School Joint Sports Meet continued at Zhongshan Park on the 28th. Field event star Chen Baoqiu threw the 16-pound shot put 12.765 meters, breaking the national record, but it was worse than his past records, disappointing the spectators. Chen participated in the discus, javelin, shot put, and long jump, winning first place in all, adding a lot of color to the Municipal Games by breaking all the records.</p>
<p>(Hankou, 28th) The Hankou Municipal Middle School Joint Sports Meet closed on the 28th. All kinds of municipal records from past sessions were completely shattered. Many records from Central China were also broken. Only one national record was broken. In the men's individual division, Chen Baoqiu was first. In the middle school men's division, Bo Ju Municipal First Middle School and Municipal Vocational School scored the most points. In the middle school women's division, Xin Mian won ten first places, showing great strength.

The total score can only be determined after the scores are calculated.</p>
<h3>Opening Ceremony Details</h3>
<p>(Hankou Air Express) At 8:00 AM on the 27th, the opening ceremony of the conference was held in the clear and refreshing weather at the new sports field in Zhongshan Park. Honorary Chairman Zhang Xueliang, He Chengjun's representative Yang Kuiyi, Zhang Qun's representative Ding Bingquan, Ye Peng, Chairman Wu Guozhen, Vice Chairman Chen Xizeng, Chief Referee Wu Shaoshu, and representatives from various organizations and groups attended. All staff and athletes circled the field for a week, and then Chairman Wu Guozhen gave the opening speech, saying that the Municipal Sports Meet is now being held for the fifth time. The first, second and third sessions were held hastily and did not produce significant results. By the fourth session, the equipment gradually became perfect, and the results improved rapidly. Now it is the fifth session, which coincides with the spirit of Shangwu being promoted and developed. I hope that today's competition will not be about winning and losing, but also about not being discouraged by defeat. The results of the conference will definitely be a complete harvest. Then, Honorary Chairman Zhang Xueliang gave a speech, hoping that everyone would pay attention to four points: 1. Express the national spirit through sports; 2. The conference staff should do their best; 3. Respect your own personality; 4. Conscientiously fulfill the requirements of the New Life Movement. After the speech, Yang Wencai, the commander of the conference, commanded the various schools to line up and perform group exercises together. The ceremony was completed at 11:00 AM.</p>

<p>Last Fifteen Minutes</p>
<h3>Youyou Suddenly Fails</h3>
<p>Result: Lux Team Wins 5-2</p>
<p>Losing Four Goals in the Second Half</p>
<p>One of the more important scenes in this week's Western Union Group A match was Youyou vs. Lux, which was held at Yiyuan yesterday. The progress of the game was initially dull, then gradually tense, and finally very strange, seemingly beyond the expectations of the general audience. As a result, Lux won and Youyou failed, with a score of five to two.</p>
<h3>Key Points of Victory and Defeat</h3>
<p>Youyou encountered many opportunities to score, occupying the enemy's base. It seemed within easy reach. Xi Qiaosheng's lack of skill and strength led to the blame for failing to fulfill the mission. Otherwise, if they had scored more goals earlier, they would not have failed to Lux even if they encountered misfortune later. Youyou's goalkeeper Xu Ting put on an amazing performance, praised throughout the field. Jiang Shanjing is gradually declining and is not as stable and reliable as Wang Shusen. The three-man defense line on the right is weak. The forwards are chaotic and lack a procedure, relying only on individual skills and individual development. Lux's victory was not due to the high skill of their players, but to their extraordinary spirit of struggle.</p>
<h3>Grand Momentum</h3>
<p>Youyou, with its long-standing strength, lingered in front of Lux's goal for a long time. Initially, there was no gap to take advantage of. Suddenly, a ball came from the right. The enemy was preoccupied with the border area, and the center was empty. Xi Qiaosheng could have easily resolved the situation, but he mistakenly used his defender's body as a door, hitting his body. The team leader tried to boost morale, but soon Youyou's forwards were still active. Sun Jinshun's position as center forward was not his strength, but his fierce high shots and low kicks were unmatched. At ten minutes, Mr. Sun had a free kick from 30 yards from the goal. The shot was as fast as an arrow. If it had been an inch lower, it would have hit the goalpost, and it would have been a sure goal.</p>
<h3>One Goal Each in the First Half</h3>
<p>Lux's team was greatly encouraged by this goal, scrambling to get ahead. Li Zhangguan lost the border defense, and the enemy wing slanted in. Jiang Shanjing resisted carelessly and touched the ball with his body. A penalty was called. Buck executed it flawlessly, opening the scoring. After that, there were many ups and downs, but they were all ineffective. Qiaosheng had three consecutive opportunities, but failed to make a contribution due to improper handling. In the last five minutes, he smoothly received Zhong Yongsen's forest ball and broke through the goal to tie the score. Youyou continued to encounter dangerous situations, but Xu Ting was vigilant, maintaining the status quo until the end of the first half.</p>
<h3>Another Tie</h3>
<p>Not long after the second half began, Xu Heng again saved the situation with his agile skills, winning a lot of applause. At this time, Mr. Sun switched to the left inside, and Xu Wenshu took the center forward position. Under the change of formation, the forwards became vigorous. He and his oblique assistant passed the ball into the formation. Xu Wenkui, a handsome young man, was ambitious and courageous. With the goal in sight, he shot with all his strength. The whistle sounded, announcing success. Youyou took the lead with a score of 2-1, thinking that victory was undoubtedly ours. Unexpectedly, Baoli rushed into the formation. Archi was unattended. The ball suddenly arrived, and Archi welcomed it into the goal. Xu Heng was helpless. A goal that had been hard-won was gone in the blink of an eye, which was not a good sign.</p>
<h3>Failure in an Instant</h3>
<p>As expected, in the last fifteen minutes, the situation changed dramatically. Lux seemed to have supreme authority, exerting lateral pressure. Within Youyou's domain, enemy riders galloped. Although they divided the key areas, it was difficult to resist the enemy's offensive. First, Boseli was seen entering the camp alone, then Baolotte shot in, and finally Boseli hit again. Youyou conceded three goals in a row, and the situation changed from victory to adversity in a matter of moments. Although the soldiers swore to die, it was of no help to the overall situation. As a result, Lux won 5-2.</p>
<h3>Youyou Team</h3>

<h3>Lingnan Defeats Shanghai Qing 4-3</h3>
<p>Turning Defeat into Victory with Three Consecutive Goals in the Second Half</p>
<p>The match between Lingnan and Shanghai Qing in the Chinese Football League was held at the Lingnan Football Field at the end of Shigaota Road at 3:00 PM. The referee was Lü Wanfu. Both sides were evenly matched and quite exciting. In the first half, Chen Guorui of Shanghai Qing opened the scoring. Tang Qimin of Lingnan counterattacked successfully. Shanghai Qing made a major advance and broke through the net one after another, leading with a score of 3-1. In the second half, Lingnan substituted Huang Bingming and Tang Naiqiang, boosting the momentum and turning the tide. Three goals were scored in a row. Shanghai Qing counterattacked many times. Luo Douwen took a long shot, and Xu Jiashi of Lingnan saved the day by risking his life. Therefore, Shanghai was miserably defeated with a score of 3-0. In the end, Lingnan turned defeat into victory with a score of 4-3. The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>Lingnan Team</p>
<p>Xu Jiashi, Su Hexiang, Lin Weiyong, Huang Panfa, Huang Zhaoming, Huang Bingming (down), Huang Guanzhi (up), Zhao Jie, Tang Yinghuan, Tang Naiqiang (down), Huang Jinyuan, Li Bingze, Tang Qilian (up)</p>

<p>Ministry of Education Studies Production Education</p>
<h3>Has Already Achieved Considerable Results</h3>
<p>At the beginning of his tenure, Minister of Education Wang Shijie stated that to save China, the first thing to do is to seek the implementation of production education. The directors of education departments in various provinces and cities also consider production education as the most urgent need at present. However, the administrative aspects of formulating plans and seeking implementation depend on the actual workers, that is, the educators who organize the actual work. At the last conference, researchers of production education were elected, including Chen Lijiang, Tai Shuangqiu, Gu Mei, and Jiang Wen. They are investigating the state of education (this investigation and research work was carried out by German Tu Shushi, French Wu Junsheng, British Chen Jian Tiao, Warring States Tao Zhixing, Japanese Ma Zongrong, American Zhong Zan, and Philippine Zhuang Zexuan, each responsible for a specific area. They have all conducted investigations and research and have achieved considerable results). They were divided into research groups, and each has their own report. There are more than 100,000 words in total, which are being compiled and will be published around the end of November. The contents are classified as follows: 1. The meaning and goals of production education; 2. The historical development of production education; 3. The prerequisite problems of production education; 4. The methods of production education; 5. The situation of implementation in various places; 6. The situation of implementation in various countries (researchers were assigned to investigate and research countries as mentioned above); 7.

The time is from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM every day. Unemployed graduates from universities and colleges and specialized talents in the city can go to register.</p>

<h3>Key Points for Recent Improvement of Junior Colleges and Above (I)</h3>
<p>The following is a speech given by Huang Jianzhong, Director of the Department of Commerce and other Education of the Ministry of Education, at the Central Broadcasting Station on October 24:</p>
<p>Minister Wang of the Ministry of Education has already talked about the current situation of higher education in his previous speech on the current situation of Chinese education. What I want to talk about today are the key points for the recent improvement of junior colleges and above by the Ministry of Education. Junior colleges and above are institutions for studying advanced academics and cultivating specialized talents. Therefore, higher education is also called talent education. Since the beginning of political tutelage, all construction undertakings have been underway, and the construction of talents is naturally felt to be an urgent need. After the September 18th Incident, the need for talents in national defense became even more urgent. Therefore, the Ministry of Education has been determined to improve junior colleges and above in recent years to meet the needs of the country and society. As for the results of the improvement in the past few years, has there been any progress? How much progress has been made? To answer these two questions, we must conduct a detailed observation from the aspects of quality and quantity. However, quality and quantity are mutually causal. To improve quality, we must first understand the results of quantity. We must rely on the results of quantity to improve quality, so that the improvement of quality will not be in vain. At the same time, the results of quality improvement also depend on quantity for measurement. Otherwise, how much quality has been improved will still not be known accurately. Now, I will first report to everyone on the quantity and distribution of junior colleges and above nationwide.</p>
<p>According to recent surveys, there are a total of 111 junior colleges and above nationwide, an increase of eight from the 20th year of the Republic and an increase of seven from the 21st year of the Republic, including one National Art College, one Provincial Agricultural College, one Provincial Engineering College, one Private Medical College, one Women's Medical College, one Business College, and one Women's Arts and Sciences School. Except for the National Peiping Art College, which was established in response to the needs of North China, five schools are related to practical subjects and one school is related to women's education. In terms of the nature of establishment, among the 111 schools, 28 are national (including 10 junior colleges, 5 independent colleges, and 13 universities), 32 are provincial (10 junior colleges, 14 independent colleges), and 8 are universities, and 51 are private (9 junior colleges, 22 independent colleges, and 20 universities). The total number of national and provincial schools is 60, only nine more than private schools. In terms of the distribution of schools, they can be divided into four major centers: 20 in Peiping and Tianjin in North China, eight in Guangdong in South China, 30 in Jinghu in East China, and 15 in Sichuan, Hubei, Henan, and Hunan in Central China. In other provinces, except for the nine provinces and regions of Jehol, Heilongjiang, Suiyuan, Ningxia, Qinghai, Guizhou, Xikang, Tibet, and Mongolia, where there are no junior colleges or above, the rest have seven schools at most and one school at least. Therefore, the distribution of junior colleges and above nationwide is now ranked first in East China, second in North China, third in Central China, and fourth in South China. However, what needs to be added here is that it is not very reasonable for most universities and junior colleges to be concentrated in one or two cities. The newly established Northwest Agricultural and Forestry Junior College is located in Shaanxi to remedy this malpractice. In the future, this principle should still be followed to rationalize the distribution of schools.</p>
<p>Judging from the above number of schools, there is currently no need for extremely rapid expansion in the number of junior colleges and above nationwide. The most important thing is to improve the quality. Now, I will briefly report on the key points for recent improvement.</p>

<h3>From the Relief Work in the Newly Recovered Bandit Areas of Southern Jiangxi to the Public Free Clinic System (I)</h3>
<p>— Lecture by Mr. Pang Jingzhou, recorded by Chen Shengbai and Jiang Huiming</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>On October 23rd, Mr. Pang Jingzhou came to the school to give a lecture. He was instructed on the status of relief work in the newly recovered bandit areas of Southern Jiangxi. After listening, I deeply felt that Mr. Pang not only detailed the relief work in Southern Jiangxi but also added digressions and opinions on medical facilities. His transcendence of thought, thoroughness of speech, foresight of vision, and precision of planning are enough to inspire deep reflection. Therefore, this manuscript is specially published for reference by those who care about medical affairs. The reporter was in a hurry at the time and did not take accurate notes. It is inevitable that there will be omissions. I have to apologize to Mr. Pang!</p>
<p>According to Mr. Pang, he went to Jiangxi at the request of the Shanghai Local Association. Mr. Pang gladly accepted the task amidst his busy diagnosis, which made the younger generation respect his enthusiasm for public welfare and benefiting the people.</p>
<p>Reporter recognized at Southeast Medical College</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>Although this relief work is limited to the newly recovered bandit areas of Southern Jiangxi, the affairs of Southern Jiangxi can also be associated with the general medical problems in China. Moreover, based on the inspections in other provinces, it has aroused the fundamentally different concepts of rural medicine and urban medicine. This is what I want to specifically propose to you for discussion.</p>
<p>Starting from Shanghai to Guangchang, Jiangxi, the destination, what is most noteworthy is that the first is the lack of materials felt in the newly recovered bandit area. The second is the desolation of people's livelihood. What I saw in the area were only troops and refugees. Everywhere were sick people wandering around, which were the vestiges of the war. When our group arrived in Guangchang, because the place had been recovered for three months, after the rectification of the bandit suppression army and the efforts to implement the New Life Movement, it had finally recovered to a considerable extent.</p>
<p>Of course, in such a place, it is really not easy to talk about medical issues. Even though local post-war and relief work can be carried out after the bandit area is recovered, the lack of local practicing doctors and the inadequacy of relief agencies still result in those who are not sick being unable to prevent illness and those who are sick being unable to be saved—Although there are the Red Cross Society and the Jiangxi Provincial Health Department in Nanchang (under the Health Experimental Office of the National Economic Commission), because of the lack of talents to allocate, they have not yet served in Guangchang. As for the military doctors, they are already too busy, so of course they cannot take care of general relief work. Other church hospitals in the provincial capital are residences for high-class patients and will never think of relief work.</p>
<p>There are more than 3,000 refugees in Guangchang, and about 7,000 refugees are located 70 to 80 miles near Guangchang, and more than half of them are sick. Moreover, the refugee shelters that accommodate refugees are small shelters that are several miles apart. Just imagine that our limited staff can go to rescue so many sick people. Wouldn't that be a difficult task? However, fortunately, we went to Guangchang from Shanghai to carry out relief work for a total of one week, and I asked myself that it was very fast.</p>
<p>In order to solve the difficulty of local material supply, the implementation of our relief work had to take the following methods:</p>
<p>1. Establish free clinics (simple and crude, with wooden boards set up as tables in a broken house).</p>
<p>2. Regular inspections of refugee shelters.</p>
<p>3. Specially prepare mixtures as medicines.</p>
<p>From the standpoint of scientific medicine, this method seems not very reasonable to criticize severely. However, according to the following thing to measure, it is still what we are deeply congratulating ourselves and are not ashamed of.</p>
<p>What's the matter? In that area, we have also seen ten drops of water and other medicines distributed by general philanthropists. But unfortunately, because of the superficial medical knowledge of the general public and the lack of guiding talents, some people have even made mistakes in taking ten drops of water. Such so-called charitable relief only makes the slightly sick worse and the seriously ill die. Such things may be laughed at by people living a noble life in prosperous cities. Gentlemen, if you have been there and have gained some experience from bandit areas or rural areas, I believe you will definitely have sympathy. Our work, due to economic inadequacy, too few talents, and a bad environment, is certainly far from the ideal scientific medicine in the treatment methods used. But in terms of the situation in Jiangxi, it can also be said that medical treatment and medicine are being practiced at the same time.</p>
<p>As for the report on relief work, according to news I received after returning to Shanghai, in addition to medical facilities, one or two hours are drawn out every day to do disease prevention work. However, it is inevitable that a small number of people will be a little flustered to deal with more than 300 patients every day.</p>
<p>According to statistics, the most commonly treated diseases are dermatology, minor surgery, dysentery, malaria, beriberi, and malnutrition. There are also many digestive diseases, nervous system diseases, and ophthalmology is relatively the least.</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>The relief work in the newly recovered bandit areas has been briefly described above. The following is a miscellaneous record outside the topic.</p>
<p>(A) Medical and Pharmaceutical Undertakings in Jiangxi.</p>
<p>1. The weakness of the Red Cross Society—The Red Cross Society in Jiangxi is as lifeless as in other provinces. We can get a glimpse of this from the conversation between Mr. Pan Ji, Director of the Jiangxi Provincial Health Department. When Mr. Pan first came to Jiangxi to take office, because Jiangxi lacked relatively large houses and the difficulty in delaying talents during the founding period, he thought of cooperating with the Red Cross Society. So he went to visit the president of the Nanchang Red Cross Hospital to discuss the cooperation plan. According to the president's reply, he was too busy to take care of himself and could not talk about any cooperation. As a result, he could not get any results. Here we can clearly realize that the cause of the Red Cross Society of the same nature needs to be invigorated, and a Association Committee was specially organized to raise some funds, intending to help Chairman Chiang to suppress bandits and rectify the rear. It is said that it can do relief work. But in reality, if relief work really wants to be carried out, it is very difficult to see. First, the provincial government must send a letter to the association, and then the association must hold a meeting to make a resolution, and then it can allocate funds. They will designate it to the Red Cross Society or other medical personnel, and organize a team to go to do relief work. But on the one hand, the association must also inform the official, and only after obtaining the official's consent can it be implemented in accordance with the meeting's resolution. The procedures in between are cumbersome, and the correspondence is complicated. Such slowness can only make people sigh that distant water cannot put out a nearby fire.</p>
<p>2. Improvement of Military Foundation—During this period of bandit suppression in Jiangxi, a large army gathered, and military doctors also increased with the army. Chairman Chiang, cherishing the suffering of officers and soldiers, ordered Lu Zhide, Director of the Military Medical Department, to reorganize it, and there has been considerable progress. Mr. Lu is now imitating the method of military training, and every two or three months, a few military doctors at a time, take turns to hold supplementary lectures to supplement the medical knowledge of the military doctors. At the same time, he personally inspects the situation in the areas under his jurisdiction in order to formulate personal work guidelines and seek to increase work efficiency. From his observations, he advocated that medicine should be simple and rationalized, and even said that there may be multi-level medical talents. He said: In this way, service talents can be increased, and scientific medicine in rural areas can be popularized. Moreover, the implementation of the multi-level system of medical talents will not hinder the research work of medicine. The discussion about the multi-level system will be described again. I think that Lord Lu has really felt the lack of talents and is very difficult.</p>
<p>Recently, I met Mr. Di, the Dean of Xiangya Medical College, at a meeting in the Ministry of Education in the capital. He also advocated that medicine should be simplified, medical education should be adapted to local conditions, and the medical curriculum standards should be slightly flexible.</p>
<p>We see that the reason why the two gentlemen have this view is due to their frequent contact with the countryside and their understanding of the general situation in China. As for some people who think that American scholars often hold high opinions and take the New World as the law, it is not entirely true. In short, if you recognize the country of China, you will make practical remarks.</p>
<h3>On Pathogenic Protozoa (II)</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yanggao</p>
<p>In addition to the previous binary division, one protozoan can be turned into two. There will be budding, a bud will be issued on the thread, and gradually detach from the mother body and (2) multiple division, that is, a mother body, simultaneously dividing into more than two protozoan numbers. When these two methods are used for reproduction, the work of the nucleus is also similar to that of binary division. However, in multiple divisions, the nucleus performs binary divisions several times. But what about the protoplasm? It often waits until the nucleus is divided before separating according to the number of young nuclei. As for the method of its separation, it is very simple, like a ball of common plant seeds, when it matures, it will burst when it encounters a small motive.</p>
<p>Some people may ask, when will the main nucleus of these larvae want to split again? Want to reproduce again? Then, it is necessary to involve the issue of growth. Of course, it cannot be divided without growing up. However, the growth rate of protoplasm and nucleus in the same protozoan body is not parallel. The protoplasm grows very fast first, often exceeding the growth rate of the nucleus by more than twice. After the protoplasm has grown to the appropriate degree, the nucleus will be a small one. However, once this period arrives, the nucleus will not show weakness and will suddenly increase its growth rate until it can split.</p>
<p>Not only is the comparison of the growth of protoplasm and nucleus like this, but we also know that the two kinds of matter in the light nucleus (that is, the moving matter and the transmitting matter mentioned above) are also like this. Sometimes the transmitting matter has grown very large, and the moving matter will be pressed and unmoved, which will implicate the entire visible nucleus, and it cannot be split. It is not surprising. In short, the reproduction of a protozoan is also greatly related to the work of growth. Just like we humans also have people who have reached a certain age but have not fully developed. After talking so much about protozoa, are there any distinctions between female and male? I think many people must have this idea. Originally, the female and male characteristics of those protozoa often exist in one body. The moving matter is believed to be male, and the transmitting matter is female. However, although there is some experimental evidence for this theory, in fact, in the group of young protozoa, there are also special female and male insects that can be distinguished. These special products are, of course, similar to the analogy of human beings. However, in lower animals, there are similar phenomena. Let's not talk too much nonsense.</p>
<p>Let's get back to the point and say that the growth ability and speed of our protozoan female and male matter are indeed different from other larvae. Generally, it is slower in comparison. Of course, since there are already female and male protozoa, we have to ask whether there is also a phenomenon of conception. Of course, in protozoa, we can see three kinds of conception methods: (1) Conjugation (temporary conjugation and nuclear exchange). (2) Fusion (two protozoa completely fuse together). (3) Self-conjugation (the phenomenon of nuclear self-division and self-combination is carried out in one body). This third type of conception seems strange at first glance. However, according to the above theory, the nuclear matter of each protozoan is already divided into different yin and yang properties, then it is of course possible to conceive in one protozoan body. It is a pity that male and female people in human beings cannot also have the same fact.</p>
<p>After talking about a set of protozoan reproduction and conception functions, let's go back and look at the static mechanics of protozoa, that is, to see how its body can be evenly suspended in our universe. If the shape of the protozoa is spherical, it is entirely made of colloidal substance. Then, of course, there is no problem in terms of average mechanics. It can be in any position without any uneven phenomenon. And we know that this colloidal substance can also flow in the body with the necessary movements, faintly containing the tools of the highest average mechanics.</p>

<h3>The National Soul and the New Life Movement</h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>Eyes, ears, mouth, nose, four limbs, and hundreds of body parts are common to all people, yet their appearances differ from person to person! Actions, preferences, demeanors, and speech are also common to all, yet their expressions vary: Why is this? If there were no differences, there would be no distinction; without distinction, the unique individuality of a person could not be expressed. If individuality cannot be expressed, then what makes a person human is almost nonexistent! So, what will individuality rely on to express itself? It is something that has no sound when listened to, no form when viewed, yet a person's voice, appearance, smile, demeanor, and all actions rely on it for expression. It dwells silently within sound, resides formlessly within form, comes with life, and goes with death. What is this? It is the so-called soul. Just as people have it, so should a nation.</p>
<p>Land, people, attire, and institutions are common to all nations, yet their size, quantity, length, brevity, complexity, and simplicity vary from nation to nation! Politics, customs, culture, and academics are common to all nations, yet their quality, depth, height, level, profundity, and shallowness vary from nation to nation! Why is this? Differences create distinctions, and distinctions are sufficient to fully express the individuality of a nation. That which expresses this is the so-called national soul. The national soul resides within language, culture, customs, and institutions, and these rely on it as tools of expression. If the soul exists, the nation exists; if the soul perishes, the nation perishes. It is not only the nation that perishes; the entire race will sink to a position from which they will not recover, like Annam and India. Their national soul perished along with their nations, which is why they bow their heads and submit, never having thoughts of resistance or opportunities for revival.</p>
<p>Our China has stood in the world for over four thousand years! It has its glorious history! It has its unique national character! Therefore, speaking of its customs, ritual, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame are cultivated deeply, and when speaking of its culture, Confucianism, Mohism, Taoism, and Buddhism flourished greatly. Thus, it can stand independently between heaven and earth and conquer other races, as in the Han and Tang dynasties, which can be called prosperous. Its language, writing, institutions, and customs were all different from those of other races, all expressing its special status, so the spirit of its national soul has endured for thousands of years without fading. This is not just my personal opinion; anyone who reads history can say the same.</p>
<p>Our country has been conquered by foreign races more than once, but the country perished while the soul did not. How can I say this? Its language, writing, institutions, and customs did not perish, so the country was restored without delay. Even though the Manchus ruled China for over three hundred years, with the Wuchang Uprising, the old order was restored in a matter of days, showing that the national soul did not perish, and the country ultimately did not perish. Since the opening of the sea borders, Western culture has gradually spread eastward. We have realized that our country's inherent culture is not enough to cope with this rapidly changing trend. Therefore, we have learned foreign languages and emulated foreign methods, taking and studying all Western sciences and arts. However, in recent decades, have we truly grasped the essence of Western culture? Academics are not as good as theirs, and politics are not as good as theirs, while our country's inherent culture and morality have been declining day by day! Those who are obsessed with Westernization cannot help but change their shoes and unify their clothes! They use knives and forks for meals and build Western-style houses! They write their characters horizontally and speak foreign languages! They imitate all Western habits, fearing they are not thorough enough, and abandon all that belongs to our country, fearing they are not extreme enough. The only thing lacking is the ability to raise their noses and turn their eyes blue. If there were a way to raise and blue them, I know they would brag about it in front of everyone. Alas, what they have gained is only the superficial appearance of foreigners, and what they have lost is the soul of their motherland. By exchanging this for that, who gains and who loses? This is why wise people sigh and hate those beside them.</p>
<p>Can it be said that China has already perished? It still has its independent government, independent land, and people, so it has not perished. But among the four hundred million compatriots, only a few can preserve our country's inherent morality and demeanor, and the general self-proclaimed intellectual class is almost without exception imitating the superficial appearance of foreigners and trending towards Westernization! Even in our medical field, this situation is particularly evident. When a conference is held, whether it is international or not, papers must be written in foreign languages. Socializing must be done in foreign languages. Although academics are largely the same, and one cannot hold nationalistic views, languages and writing are ultimately different. If even these differences are completely eliminated, then where will the characteristics that express our country be? Then China has long perished! What has not perished is only its surviving body!</p>
<p>I observe that when a person is sick and loses their soul, the superstitious members of their family often burn incense to pray for it and shout wildly to summon it, hoping that the soul will return to the body. So, when the national soul is lost, what method can be used to summon it? I say: the New Life Movement! The New Life Movement uses the spirit of ritual, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame, dwelling within daily clothing, food, and housing, on the one hand cultivating a good personality, and on the other hand correcting extravagant customs. Regarding education, there is a directive that at least one thousand Chinese characters must be known. Its intention to reverse declining trends and punish frivolous customs is as clear as day. Alas, without this path, what method can be used to summon the already lost national soul? This is what I hope the people of the country will deeply awaken to.</p>
<h3>Common Treatment Methods for Fever (5)</h3>
<p>— Li Xing</p>
<p>Special Hygiene</p>
<p>I. Oral Hygiene: Healthy people should pay attention to oral hygiene; sick people should pay even more attention to oral hygiene. Especially hygienic oral care makes the patient feel refreshed and can improve their appetite. Feverish patients often feel thick mucus in their mouths. If they do not pay attention to hygiene, leftover food particles will be decomposed by bacteria, which on the one hand makes them feel bad breath, and on the other hand, if too many bacteria grow, the inside and outside of the mouth can ulcerate into sores. This adds another layer of pain to the patient. Here is a brief description of oral hygiene: Patients should brush their teeth and rinse their mouths after each meal. It is good to simply rinse with warm water. If you want to add toothpaste or tooth powder, that is also fine. If the mouth feels particularly bad, you can mix cold water with hydrogen peroxide, half of each, to rinse your mouth and brush your teeth. Hydrogen peroxide completely oxidizes and removes the decaying substances in the mouth, making the patient feel refreshed. If the patient is particularly weak or seriously ill, the caregiver must brush their teeth for them and help them rinse their mouth. If the patient's mouth hurts, they cannot use a toothbrush. Those with dentures should remove them after each meal, wash them with water, and then put them back in their mouth when eating. Special attention should also be paid to the corners of the lips during fever. The lips of feverish people are very prone to blisters, and the corners of the mouth are also prone to cracking and ulceration. Apply zinc oxide ointment, mineral oil, or cold cream to the lips and corners of the mouth to prevent blisters or cracking. If these problems already exist, applying these ointments can protect the skin, prevent it from further breaking down, and help it heal quickly. If oral hygiene is completely neglected, the patient's mouth will ulcerate inside and out, causing pain when eating, making it impossible to ingest food, which will affect the body's nutrition and ultimately reduce the body's resistance. If the disease is not completely cured and the mouth becomes inflamed and sores appear, wouldn't that be one wave after another? Therefore, feverish patients must pay special attention to oral hygiene.</p>
<h3>Common Sense of Ear, Nose, Throat, and Eye Hygiene</h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(20) Explanation of Cerebrospinal Fluid Leakage (Continued)</p>
<p>III. Acute Frontal Sinusitis (Sinuitis Frontalis acuta)</p>
<p>Acute frontal sinusitis rarely occurs alone. It usually occurs at the same time as acute osteomyelitis cellulitis. Its causes are the same as those of acute maxillary sinusitis, except that it is not caused by dental caries. The only major symptom of this disease is pain in the frontal region. This pain is most severe when the nasal mucosa in the frontal region is swollen and the drainage of secretions (pus) in the sinus is obstructed. At this time, the patient's suffering is most unbearable. They often think that this frontal pain is just a common headache and often take painkillers, hoping to relieve the pain. However, after taking the medicine, the pain usually returns after a long time, eventually becoming incurable. In fact, it is due to acute frontal sinusitis. The patient should immediately ask a doctor to treat the sinusitis in order to fundamentally stop the pain from recurring. In addition, the patient often feels nasal congestion, excessive nasal discharge, impaired sense of smell, photophobia, tearing, pain in the eye socket, and inflammatory edema of the upper eyelid and frontal region. The mucous membrane of the nasal cavity is also generally red and swollen. Pus drainage from the middle nasal meatus can be observed from the nose. Sometimes, due to the swelling of the mucosa of the frontonasal duct, the passage is blocked, and pus drainage cannot be observed. This drainage obstruction caused by the swelling of the mucosa of the frontonasal duct can often induce destruction of the bone wall and form various complications. The bone wall that is most likely and most easily destroyed is the posterior wall of the eye socket. Once the bone wall ruptures, it becomes an orbital abscess. At this time, symptoms such as swelling of the eyelids, protrusion of the eyeball, and movement disorders of the eyeball also occur. The second most likely bone wall to be destroyed is the anterior wall of the face, which first develops an abscess in the frontal region and then becomes a fistula.</p>
<p>This disease can often be cured by appropriate conservative treatment, which includes resting in bed, taking diaphoretic medicine internally, and applying ice packs or warm compresses locally, or irradiating with a Solux lamp or using an electric light bath. On the one hand, a specialist doctor applies medicated solutions near the middle nasal meatus to facilitate pus drainage. If the pain is severe and there is a risk of bone wall destruction, radical surgery should be performed.</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (26)</h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Chapter VIII: Clinical Examination Methods</p>
<p>When a doctor questions a patient, one thing that should also be noted is that patients should avoid exaggerations and only state the most important things. Doctors should provide guidance on the key points. However, this is easier said than done. When encountering patients lacking medical knowledge, or ignorant villagers, they may say a great deal, but little of it is relevant to the topic. This is something doctors cannot help. However, readers should know that inquiring about past symptoms is the initial step for doctors when diagnosing a disease. The patient's account can be used as a reference before the examination, but not every word should be taken as historical fact. For example, obstructive bronchitis caused by heart valve disease can be almost identical to the symptoms of this disease based solely on the patient's account. The final judgment of right and wrong cannot be made by the doctor without employing the second step of technical procedures, which is the diagnostic work described above.</p>
<p>(II) Physical Examination: In the past, old doctors had a four-word formula for diagnosing diseases: "Observe, Listen, Ask, and Palpate." Of these, only palpation represented the doctor's diagnostic tools. It is well-known that this is not enough to deal with various complex symptoms. Modern medicine is different. In addition to physical examination and X-ray fluoroscopy, various diagnostic aids for each disease are very helpful. The situation for pulmonary tuberculosis is, of course, no exception. In the four procedures of physical examination, percussion and auscultation are the most important. We can boldly say that except for heart diseases, these two procedures almost completely cover this disease. Inspection is next, and palpation is the least important. Now, I will explain each of these procedures and the results in this disease one by one. The details of bacterial and X-ray examinations will be discussed in detail in later sections.</p>
<h3>The Pharmacy Department of the Sino-French University in the Last Five Years (3)</h3>
<p>— Jinru</p>
<p>VI. Library: In April of the 19th year of the Republic, the department organized a Library Committee, appointing Professors He Jianqing, Zhao Rutiao, and Jia De'er as members. The committee was responsible for planning and implementing the fundraising, book selection, and management regulations. In the 22nd year of the Republic, with the passing of Committee Member He Jianqing and the departure of Zhao Rutiao, Professors Cao Bonian and Chen Siyi were appointed to fill the vacancies. The initial plan formulated by the committee was divided into two sections.</p>
<p>(A) Funding: It was proposed that starting in the 22nd academic year, each incoming freshman would be required to pay a library fee of five yuan as a savings fund. In addition, one-tenth of the regular expenses, approximately 5,000 national currency, would be saved each year for purchasing domestic books and other equipment. However, due to the poor social and economic conditions and the financial difficulties of the students, and the school itself was experiencing financial difficulties, this plan could not be implemented. It is reported that starting this year, the Ministry of Education will provide a subsidy of 10,000 yuan per year, and the department has decided to allocate 70% of it specifically for purchasing library equipment.</p>
<p>(B) Books: The selection of books will tentatively follow the following criteria:</p>
<p>I. Books: Focus on the pharmaceutical aspects, followed by medicine, science, chemistry, zoology, botany, mineralogy, etc. The quantity of other science books purchased will depend on the needs of the school and the economic situation. In the 20th year of the Republic, statistics showed 77 Chinese and foreign (English, French, German, Japanese) pharmaceutical books and over 1,000 other books, along with 16 important magazines, totaling approximately 3,000 yuan in value. In September of the 23rd year of the Republic, statistics showed that the number of Chinese and foreign pharmaceutical books had increased to 101, along with 219 other books and 1,056 other types of books, as well as 35 important magazines, totaling approximately 5,000 yuan in value.</p>
<p>VII. Series: It is planned to compile various lecture notes into books and publish extracurricular works and translations by the faculty as a series. The published works include Mr. Jia De'er's "Plant Chemistry," "Food Analysis," and "Mineral Water Studies," as well as Mr. Zhu Renhong's "Quantitative Analysis of Pharmaceuticals." Other works such as "Pharmaceutical Chemistry" and "Parasitology" are still in preparation.</p>
<p>VIII. Administrative Organization: A director is appointed to manage all departmental affairs, a director of academic affairs to oversee faculty courses, and several staff members to handle various tasks. In the 21st year of the Republic, the title of director was changed to chairman. Under the direction of the department chairman and the director of academic affairs, the department is divided into four sections: registration, documentation, administration, and accounting. A library is also established. Each section and the library has one to two staff members or administrators. A school doctor is also appointed to oversee medical and health matters, and a dorm supervisor to manage student dormitory affairs. A school affairs conference, an academic affairs conference, and a joint conference of faculty and staff are established as review bodies. In addition, the following committees are established to assist in the execution of school and academic affairs: I. School Regulations Committee, II. Curriculum Committee, III.

<h3>Self-deprecation</h3>
<p>— Xiang Yu</p>
<p>If you aspire to be a writer, you should not become an editor of a magazine or a supplement. This will consume your hopes, your energy, your time, and your entire life in boring work that you do not like, have no interest in, and yet are compelled to do.</p>
<p>In nature, if you observe carefully, you can see that even in a small grass, some leaves are particularly fat and long; in a tree, some branches are particularly high; in a forest, some trees are particularly tall; when you visit famous mountains, you feel that among the row of peaks in front of you, some peaks are particularly prominent; when you look up at the celestial bodies, you also feel that some stars are particularly bright. But if you turn your gaze from nature to observe a certain profession among your fellow human beings—that is, editors who work all day long with square or horizontal characters—whether you look at historical figures or contemporary figures, have you seen many people who do such tricks rise above their peers and write several immortal masterpieces for contemporary people or future generations to appreciate?</p>
<p>Perhaps you disagree with what I said. You can cite the famous British essayist Steele was the editor, his style is as lovely as his person, as Thackeray said, he is our friend: we love him as children love their love for an A, because it is so lovely. Addison was also the editor, we only need to borrow Johnson's words: he has restored virtue to its proper dignity, and made it known that virtue should not be ashamed of innocence. This is a work that elevates the nature of literature above the glory of Greece and Rome. …… Whoever seeks to attain a clear, but not vulgar, elegant, but not ornate English style, should study Addison's works day and night. We can understand the British people's admiration for Addison. You can also say that not only that, even the laughable figure of Sir Roger de Coverley still makes us modern people of a foreign country feel interested. Furthermore, you can also cite Dickens was initially involved in journalism, and they have left us many masterpieces to read. Also, you can say that our Liang Qichao was initially involved in journalism, although his purpose in engaging in journalism was political, we will not talk about his later works, his early works - the Complete Works from the Ice-Drinker's Studio - no matter in terms of thought or style, we have been influenced by him to a certain extent. I certainly do not deny this, but apart from these few people and a few others, what works of countless other newspaper and magazine editors can be passed down to posterity?</p>
<p>A few months ago, I received a copy of the "Overland Monthly" May issue, because this month was the magazine's 90th anniversary, and many articles by famous people that the magazine had reprinted over the years were included, such as: the September 1861 issue contained 䣣東's On America; the June 1844 issue contained Carlyle's Letter to the Youth; the January 1877 issue contained Ruskin's Letter to the Maidens; the March 1864 issue contained Dickens's Thackeray on; and the July 1870 issue contained Trollope's Dickens on, etc., and the former editors, such as and the current editor, etc., except for a short and clichéd introductory statement by the founder, none of the other editors had any works to offer in front of the authors. This does not mean that they never wrote articles, nor does it mean that they were fundamentally unable to write articles, but that they were entangled in their magazine affairs, had no time to write articles, and even the articles they wrote have now lost their era significance and relative value.</p>
<p>We say that an editor of a newspaper or magazine is a businessman rather than a writer. All his time is spent on reviewing manuscripts, and this work, like a gold digger in the desert, is not easy to find a speck of gold in the boundless sand, and it is not easy for an editor to find some useful manuscripts in a pile of manuscripts. In this way, when he finishes reviewing the manuscripts for the day, he is already burdened with heavy fatigue, and even if he has the talent and ambition to write, he has no interest in writing, let alone writing great works.</p>
<p>Secondly, even if an editor can write, he does not write out of impulse, but really writes for the interests of their readers. He cannot write what he likes to write in his heart, he can only write what his readers like in their hearts. Therefore, the main task of an editor is to select those fresh and stimulating topics that are popular now to suit the taste of the readers. However, all popular, fresh, and stimulating topics only have temporal significance and no eternal significance: all general reading materials should only have popularity and not their particularity. In other words, on the editor's side, he has to move forward one step, while on the reader's side, he has to take a step back, and for personal special interests, he has to take a step back. Who to write for? For the general public – this is the nature of newspapers and magazines! That's how special works are made.</p>
<p>Thirdly, we know that there was a man named Damocles in ancient Syracuse who once looked up at a banquet and saw a sword hanging over his head by a hair. As long as the hair holding the sword breaks, the sword will fall down and kill him, but Damocles's usual desire for the crown is true after all. And the editors of newspapers and magazines are now in several unfree countries in Europe, after all, they are without evening, but the sword is not the sword that Macbeth imagined in his mind. Therefore, even if a person who edits newspapers and magazines, his thoughts, reflected in words, can have the roar of a lion, but the social progress of walking at the pace of an ox is incompatible. Therefore, even if there are thoughts that can promote human progress, but limited by the environment, he finally does not dare to express them in writing, it is not that there are none. In this situation, what is written is naturally mediocre in thought and the most inferior thing.</p>
<p>Because of this, from a bad point of view, an editor of a newspaper or magazine really wastes his life. Even from a good point of view, it is at most creating some fluctuating air, and if this air is to become a social advance that pushes the pace of an ox, it still needs other forces to help. If an editor of a newspaper or magazine, when his life is about to end, looks back on his past remarks, and there have been a few times when he can suddenly turn up a few bubbles under the still water surface, which can slightly fluctuate the quiet water surface, that is his only comfort.</p>

<h3>Discovery of Dinosaur Bones from 150 Million Years Ago</h3>
<p>— Special</p>
<p>Sinclair Dinosaur Expedition of the American Museum of Natural History recently discovered dinosaur bones in Big Horn Mountains, Wyoming, unearthing a total of twelve sets of dinosaur bones. These animals were fifteen-ton amphibious reptiles from the age of dinosaurs. The size of their bodies can be imagined from this weight. The team is now returning to New York from Big Horn Mountains. According to Mr. Adamson, who participated in this work, it can be inferred from these bones that there was a severe drought in ancient times, about 150 million years ago. At that time, the surrounding springs had dried up, and perhaps only Big Horn Mountains still had some springs that had not completely dried up, so these large reptiles gathered there to drink their last water. What is even more surprising is that when we unearthed these large bones, we also unearthed the bones of smaller animals. Including their teeth, they were no more than three or four inches long and weighed about five ounces. They specialized in eating the flesh and blood of large animals, like bandits among humans. Because they were greedy for dinosaurs, they followed the amphibious animal groups to Big Horn Mountains, but unexpectedly encountered a drought and died in the dried-up caves. Dinosaurs are animals that combine birds and reptiles. What they swallowed was as large as pillars. The fossils discovered by the team this summer include two that are indeed important: one is a pair of small dinosaurs, as large as modern turkeys, and the other is a type of dinosaur with a head like a duck's bill.</p>
<p>Dr. Brown, the leader of the Sinclair Dinosaur Expedition of the American Museum of Natural History, is now considering a plan to explore dinosaurs from the sky. The planned flight is about 12,000 miles. They will not fly along established air routes but will fly over the mountains, deserts, and treacherous plateau canyons of Montana, southern Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Arizona, and New Mexico. Dr. Brown stated, "Of course, we don't expect to see dinosaur bones in the air, but the mountains in various places have different colors and combinations, which are easier to distinguish only from the air. Between the gray shale marine deposits of the Jurassic period 140 million years ago and the brown marine deposits of the Cretaceous period about 110 million years ago, there is an iridescent soil belt, which is rich in dinosaur bones. That is the parade ground of dinosaurs between the two great floods of prehistoric oceans. The purpose of the flight is to find fossil-bearing strata, which range from 120 feet to 400 feet wide. From our experience, we know that identifying fossil belts from the air is much more accurate than on the ground. We plan to take hundreds of aerial photographs of the terrain to identify the nature of fossils in each area, just as doctors identify diseases from X-rays. In other words, airplanes and aerial cameras have now opened up a new realm in geology and paleontology."</p>
<h3>Child</h3>
<p>— Dai</p>
<p>Married for five years, gave birth to a child last year, a boy. My friends all congratulated me as if it were a major event. Even my family, from whom we were taken away a month after our marriage, exceptionally sent a letter, mentioning postpartum care and child-rearing methods, etc.</p>
<p>At the full-month celebration banquet, when I thanked my friends, I said, "I've started to be a beast of burden!"</p>
<p>Although I have been living the same life for four years.</p>
<p>But the child is ultimately precious. Today, a fast letter came from my hometown during the New Year, asking me to take the child home during my first confinement.</p>
<p>After being separated for five years, my son will bring back a lovely grandson. They seem to be satisfied with their desire regarding the principle of marrying a daughter-in-law. This child, I must take home once as if making a tribute. On the train back, I thought about my turbulent life over the past few years and said to the child, "Why didn't you come into this world sooner?"</p>
<p>When I returned to Shanghai, they wanted to leave the child in the countryside, but he was too stupid. Seeing me put on my clothes to leave, he snuggled in my arms and wouldn't let his mother hold him, so we finally came out together. I wonder if he knows that in Shanghai, he will continue my life as a beast of burden?</p>
<p>But the child is ultimately precious. On the child's first birthday this year, his grandmother came all the way from the countryside, held him for the whole day, and took a photo back. I once wondered why my grandmother didn't treat her grandson like this?</p>
<p>This is the way of life. That's why children cry loudly when they are born.</p>
<p>Children are precocious. Now he can make gestures to represent what he wants to say. According to my nanny, I was also very lovable when I was a child. I sincerely hope he doesn't inherit my fate entirely!</p>
<p>A few days ago, I took him to a department store to buy a set of flannel clothes. When we passed the toy department, he made gestures and noises. The most eye-catching thing on the counter was a very large foreign doll. The child knew this was fun and clamored to buy it. I checked the price tag, which was five dollars and ninety-five cents. He probably forgot that he cried loudly when he was born.</p>
<p>"Why don't you live in the countryside?" I thought, "Your grandmother will definitely be able to fulfill your wish!"</p>
<p>His mother couldn't stand it and bought a small toy, but he threw it hard. When we got home, he cried, perhaps because it wasn't time to eat milk or be held by his mother. He rolled around on the bed and threw the small toy under the bed.</p>
<p>It's a pity he can't speak. I really want him to understand: "Child, this is just your beginning. Following your father will never make you happy, especially since you are fundamentally your grandmother's grandson! Be good and don't cry until you can't find a job!"</p>
<p>That night, he woke up crying from time to time. Perhaps he was dreaming about that foreign doll?</p>
<p>Today, someone found the small toy from under the bed. As soon as he saw it, he cried loudly. The child's strong memory is too much like mine. I really don't want him to inherit my fate?</p>
<p>I hope he can leave me and return to the countryside, so that at least he can spend a short childhood like I did!</p>
<h3>Small Square Calligraphy (Four)</h3>
<p>— Why</p>
<p>My father's achievement of his wish was entirely accidental. I heard that Mr. Zhang's tenant died. That summer, due to drought, the rice was all scorched. Therefore, during the autumn harvest, everyone demanded to stop paying taxes, no matter how much they urged, it was useless. The county government also sent police to the countryside to help him urge, taking bundle after bundle. One of his concubines also died, which made him even more sad. He decided to get rid of the bad luck at the end of the year and renovate the entire house. The old square calligraphy couplets naturally needed a new look. But he couldn't find a famous calligrapher for a while, and since the end of the year was approaching, he had no choice but to ask me to write a large batch of square calligraphy papers to temporarily paste up, and then officially paint them in the spring.</p>
<p>My father's joy was simply indescribable. As soon as he returned from Mr. Zhang's mansion, he ordered me to stop writing, saying that I needed to rest and recharge. "If you're tired now, you won't have the energy to write for Mr. Zhang's family later..."</p>
<p>To find better square calligraphy books, he went to the city on purpose. It snowed heavily that day, as if everyone was sifting flour. The entire world seemed to have turned into a mill, and everything looked hazy. The northwest wind was blowing hard, the fields were shaking violently, and the small ditches along the road were filled with desolation, with the sound of thin ice breaking. My father was originally very afraid of the cold. Even at home, he would always tuck his sleeves in and warm his hands by the fire, like an old cat. But that day, he braved the wind and snow and took such a long and arduous road to the city to find square calligraphy books, simply to please Mr. Zhang. Seeing his hunched back and his trembling hands holding the umbrella handle, I felt not only anger and shame but also pity for his foolishness.</p>
<p>He brought back an encyclopedia of daily use, which contained couplets and other materials. There were many options, and he told me to choose myself.</p>
<p>"Choose those that are more ancient and elegant. The more ancient and elegant, the better!"</p>

<p>Economic Supplement</p>
<h3>Chinese Agricultural Economy as Seen from International Trade</h3>
<p>— Yu Jieqiong</p>
<p>China is a country based on agriculture, and domestic economic activities are based on agricultural products. Even international trade relies on agricultural products. Our national economy is completely based on the people and their endeavors. Even today, although some new-style industries have emerged in cities, agriculture remains the cornerstone of the national economy.</p>
<p>The international trade of general agricultural countries usually involves exporting agricultural products and importing industrial products. Since the world economic panic, the price of agricultural products has fallen particularly sharply, and agriculture has suffered the most. In the past, a certain amount of agricultural products could be exchanged for a certain amount of industrial products, but now, because the price of agricultural products has fallen much more than that of industrial products, a certain amount of agricultural products can no longer be exchanged for the same amount of industrial products as before, and an additional loss must be compensated. Therefore, in recent years, the economic panic in agricultural countries has been much more severe than in industrial countries. Our country is one of the agricultural countries, and naturally, we have suffered the same great loss. Therefore, the economic panic in our country's rural areas in recent years has been affected by the international economy in two ways: one is the general decline of the international economy, which is induced into China through international trade; the other is the special situation of the decline of the agricultural economy, which is also imported into the agricultural economy of China through international trade.</p>
<p>In recent years, China's agricultural export trade has not only been affected by prices, suffering infinite losses, but also showed a significant decline in trade volume. The decline in export volume can be said to be the result of the general decline in the world economy, while the loss in price reduction is the result of the special impact of world agriculture. Now, let us analyze the situation of the decline of the agricultural economy in recent years based on these two facts.</p>
<p>First, let us observe from the perspective of volume. In recent years, due to the continuous occurrence of natural disasters, the expansion of bandit areas, and the deepening of foreign aggression into the hinterland, export volume can be said to have plummeted. However, the bandit areas are in the hinterland, the foreign aggression also threatens the hinterland, and the areas affected by natural disasters are also in the hinterland. Therefore, agriculture has been most severely affected, and the decline in agricultural exports is particularly severe. Let us look at the index of agricultural export trade in recent years to understand the general situation of the decline of the rural economy in recent years (compiled by the Social Economic Survey Institute):</p>
<p>The general index includes seeds and seed cake, grains, fruits and nuts, tobacco, sugar cane, and wool, which are not included in other items.</p>
<p>Among the various export industries, soybeans and soybean products have declined the most. The main reason is naturally that because the Northeast has been lost, the exports from outside the customs are no longer included in China's customs records. As for the soybean production in the mainland, it is very small and not worth mentioning. The second is grains and products. In recent years, only foreign rice and wheat have been imported, and there has been no large-scale export of food. Although the rural areas have had good harvests and surplus production, in the entire world market, food is mostly surplus. Due to the limitations of world prices and transportation, the movement of surplus grains in rural areas to large cities is still impossible. Exporting them is naturally even more out of the question. Therefore, although the harvest in rural areas in recent years has not been disastrous, foreign rice and wheat are still imported as usual, and exports have plummeted. The index in 1933 has dropped to 33.86. This year, with the great drought across the country, the extreme decline in exports is naturally expected, and the full-year figures have already indicated the trend. The next is silk. Our country's silk industry is already at the end of its rope. Under the pressure of Japanese silk, it is evident that our country's silk industry will be completely destroyed. The exports in recent years have declined permanently. Although the government has provided considerable relief, and the people are struggling hard, it is impossible to reverse the downward trend because they have encountered the general shrinking of the world market and such a strong enemy as Japan. Silk is an important sideline of rural areas and an important aspect of the national economy. In the past, silk products uniquely supported our country's export business, but now it has encountered such bad luck, and the impact is huge, needless to say. The next is eggs, which have also shown a significant decline in recent years. The fact that egg exports account for such a high proportion of exports fully demonstrates the poor and pitiful lives of ordinary farmers. In recent years, the life in rural areas has become increasingly difficult, but egg exports have decreased, which indicates that it is not because they are consuming it themselves, but because life is difficult and demand has decreased. On the one hand, it is due to the expansion of disaster-stricken areas in the country, and people do not have the opportunity to live and work in peace; another important reason is that the sharp drop in egg prices makes the income of farmers raising chickens insufficient to offset the cost of production, so they have to close down. This is the reason for the decline of the egg industry in recent years. Although the export indices of other vegetable oils, tea, cotton, livestock, and meat have declined to some extent, their situation is relatively good and not as bad.</p>
<p>Looking at the overall export index, it can be seen that 1932 was a turning point in the Chinese rural economy. In 1931, the total index of 65 export agricultural products was still 101.61, but in 1932, it suddenly dropped to 62.99. The situation in 1933 was even worse, dropping to 46.03. The first quarter of this year was even worse, and the total index dropped to 26.47. If the downward trend does not change, the future is really unimaginable. The sudden deterioration of agricultural export trade in 1932 cannot be fully explained by one reason alone. The most important reason is naturally the separation of the territory of the eastern provinces, and a large amount of agricultural exports are not included in China's customs records; the second is that countries that have close trade relations with us have successively abandoned the gold standard and depreciated their currencies, blocking the export of our agricultural products through monetary policies; the third is the damage caused by natural disasters in the most fertile areas of our country. The great flood in the Yangtze and Huai rivers in 1931 only affected the fourth quarter of that year, but the aftermath had a significant impact on the economy in 1932. In addition, the aggravation of social unrest and the Battle of Shanghai all had an impact on the export business that year. The combination of these many reasons within a year led to the large-scale decline in agricultural exports in 1932.</p>
<p>The decline in agricultural exports has led to the unbalanced trade in rural areas. Agricultural products can no longer be transported out, or there is nothing to transport out at all, but the lives of farmers have already fallen below the survival line, and the needs have been reduced to the point where they cannot be reduced any further. If they are reduced further, they will not be able to survive. Under the pressure of this biased trade situation, farmers have no way to survive anymore. The excess of imports over exports in the trade between rural areas and inland cities has sucked all the meager cash of rural areas into the cities. Inland cities are not production centers; their goods are wholesaled from commercial ports. They transport goods from commercial ports into rural areas, but they do not transport agricultural products out of the ports, or the amount transported out is very small, which is not enough to offset the amount transported in. Therefore, they have to transport the cash collected from the rural areas to the commercial ports as compensation. In this way, cash is concentrated in the commercial ports. However, China's commercial ports are not production centers where national industries are located but hubs for imported foreign goods. The goods in the commercial ports are imported goods. The amount of imports and the amount of exports are vastly different. Several tools for international balance, such as remittances from overseas Chinese and foreign investment, are declining day by day. Therefore, they have to transport cash as compensation. Even if they do not transport cash temporarily, they should deposit a large amount of cash in foreign banks on the Bund. This is the formula for the connection between China's domestic trade and international trade. We can draw this formula into the following chart:</p>
<p>The weaker the agricultural exports, the more severe the trade imbalance, the more cash is concentrated in cities, the more the international balance of payments cannot be balanced, the outflow of cash becomes unstoppable, and the panic in rural areas and the collapse of the national economy become inevitable. This is an observation from the perspective of the quantity of agricultural trade.</p>
<p>Secondly, let us observe the state of our country's agriculture from the perspective of price fluctuations.</p>
<p>To study the losses caused by the failure to coordinate the price decline of agricultural products and industrial products internationally, we should start with the price of exports and the price of imports. Our exports are mainly agricultural products, while the import of foreign goods is mainly industrial products. Therefore, the price of imports is greatly affected by the rise and fall of industrial product prices, while the price of exports is mainly governed by the price of agricultural products. From the unbalanced decline in the prices of exports and imports, we can see the magnitude of the losses we have sustained in actual receipts and payments. The price of exports has fallen particularly sharply, while the price of imports has fallen to a very limited extent. In international trade, we should be able to exchange more agricultural products for the same amount of industrial products. If the harvest of farmers does not change and the export volume does not decrease, we will still inevitably deteriorate day by day in international trade. Let us look at the following index (according to the National Tariff Commission) (January 1926 = 100):</p>
<p>From the comparison of the above items, it can be seen that the price of exports is generally worse than the price of imports. However, this is not enough to see the magnitude of our losses in international balance of payments. We should further observe. The export of goods is mainly raw materials, while the import of goods is mainly production goods and consumer goods. To gain a more accurate understanding of the losses sustained by the people in the actual international receipts and payments, we will specifically compare the indices of these three items:</p>
<p>The index of export prices of raw materials has been declining daily since 1930, with no upward trend at all, and the rate of decline is increasing day by day; conversely, the import price index of production goods reached its peak in 1931. Although it has declined slightly since then, the difference is negligible. Although the decline in the import price index of consumer goods is greater than that of production goods, it is still not as bad as the decline in the export price of raw materials.</p>
<p>Because of the unbalanced decline in export and import prices, we have suffered a great loss in actual receipts and payments, directly affecting the livelihoods of farmers and reducing the purchasing power of farmers. The unbalanced decline in prices has also had a great impact on the downward trend of the rural economy in recent years.</p>
<p>Above, we have explained the reasons for the deterioration of the rural economy in recent years from the perspective of export volume and export-import prices. Finally, we will propose a way to save this deteriorating trend.</p>
<p>International trade does not seem to be able to solve China's economic crisis. It seems to be a very difficult thing for us to achieve a favorable position in international trade. Our economic environment is not as good as others, and our talent technology and capital are not as good as others. Even if we try our best, we are still no match for others. Therefore, we suggest that instead of struggling hopelessly in international trade, we should strive to develop careers with good conditions. The supply and demand of each province should be completely based on mutual assistance and adjustment, replacing international trade with domestic trade, and reducing the international impact on us through mutual assistance and relief in domestic affairs. Perhaps there is more hope to be found in the future. If we do not establish our own foundation in this way, we will inevitably become a sacrifice in the international economic panic. This is from the perspective of the quantity of agricultural trade.</p>
<h3>On the Seriousness of Rural Bankruptcy in China as Seen From the Market</h3>
<p>— Qiang Yu</p>
<p>I. Introduction</p>
<p>In the cities of Shanghai or Nanjing, as soon as day breaks, what you hear and see most clearly and strikingly is not the danger of cars driving fast and threatening to run people over, a danger that applies equally to Chinese and foreigners. Rather, it is a reflection of a huge crisis in China's economy. Because from the glass to the engine of every car, the gasoline that fuels it, the tires it runs on, everything is foreign-made. The daily cost of automobiles alone is frightening. And those who ride in cars, the men wear foreign suits, eat foreign food, and smoke foreign cigarettes, while the women are even more shocking. The annual import of cosmetics alone is worth pondering, not to mention everything else, which is undoubtedly entirely foreign!</p>
<p>This abnormally developed Chinese city presents such contradictory madness. But what is happening in the countryside?</p>
<p>Rural bankruptcy! From government officials who ride in cars to ordinary people who live by their labor, everyone is shouting this slogan. As for the Chinese farmers of today, they are all shouting this slogan. The situation of today's Chinese farmers has reached the point where poverty leads to unrest, with most neglecting their families due to poverty, endangering their villages due to neglect, and violating laws due to the endangerment of their villages. As for the more law-abiding farmers, they are forced to borrow money to invest in agriculture. However, almost all of the profit they produce from their labor is used to pay interest on the loans, so they still need to borrow money. This cycle of borrowing continues, making life increasingly difficult for farmers. Therefore, law-abiding farmers who must borrow money must permanently bear the burden of debt interest, as heavy as a rock. Currently, they are in a state of gasping for breath, and soon they will all become interest slaves and run away.</p>
<p>The above superficial comparison of the city and the countryside, although incomplete and shallow, is sufficient to show that this old China is rushing towards its end!</p>
<p>The author has been in Zouping for a long time and has conducted some relatively objective observations of farmers' associations. He sees that they mostly eat the grain they produce themselves and wear the homespun cloth they weave themselves. On the surface, it does not seem that they need to rely on foreign goods, as if they do not have any economic relationship with other societies. However, upon examining the organization of market exchanges, it was discovered that there is the problem of the collapse of the Chinese rural economy worth studying.</p>
<p>We know that the Chinese rural economic system, within this modern industrial economic system, has been strongly shaken by Western mechanical production and capital organization, causing the foundation of Chinese social structure to lose harmony and mutual adaptation, which will promote the transformation of the entire Chinese society, and even change the structure of the entire Chinese social culture.</p>
<p>II. Historical Examination of Market Organization in a Production Society</p>
<p>In the structure of human life, economy is its primary foundation. The model of human cultural life is built on the economic productivity and economic structure of a society. Because of agricultural production methods and organization, human culture can transcend the crude forms of fishing, hunting, and nomadic production. Because of modern mechanical production and capital organization, Western society has molded modern Western culture to adapt to this new economic life.</p>
<p>The market, this exchange organization at the center of rural areas, was probably a typical phenomenon in the pre-industrial revolution era. In French, "Vendredi" (Friday), the first half of the word means "to sell" or "to trade." Therefore, Friday is the day to sell goods. In 12th and 13th-century England, markets and fairs were also the most important keys to economic exchange activities. At that time, there was so-called "Saturday Market," which was also used to supply local daily needs, and its nature was equivalent to the market in Chinese rural areas.</p>
<p>This temporary rural exchange market—the fair—is still a common trading system in the northern provinces of China. Farmers going to the market to buy and sell goods is called "趕集" (gǎn jí, attending the fair). They are usually set up in cities or larger towns and usually take place every five days. As for the scope of trading activities of each market, that is, the area of farmers attending the fair, it is generally between eleven or twelve to twenty li per square area. This can meet the basic economic needs of farmers, which can be supplied by one market.</p>
<p>III. A Glimpse of the Sources of Goods in the Market</p>
<p>After making a simple and careful observation in this small scope of farmers' market activities, I clearly saw between buying and selling that the so-called self-sufficiency of the Chinese countryside is heading towards collapse; industrial production and manufactured goods have broken through the fragile barrier of rural self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>Originally, in a self-sufficient economic life, most goods were only supplied by the neighboring local area, but now, due to the temptation of extravagant living, there has been a significant change in the desire to rely on the production, supply, and assistance of industrial society.</p>
<p>Now, please briefly describe the goods bought and sold in the market, and from this phenomenon, find some of the roots of the economic bankruptcy of the Chinese countryside.</p>
<p>The important foods sold in the market, such as rice cakes, bread, sweet potatoes, vegetables, pork, noodles, eggs, chicken, cloth shoes, homespun cloth, scallions, garlic, persimmons, pears, pomegranates, unprocessed cotton, and bagged grains such as sorghum, millet, corn, mung beans, fresh fish, and crabs, are estimated to account for slightly more than 50%. The source of these things is of course no more than one hundred li away at the farthest. It can also be clearly seen that these things are the surplus products of farmers or the production of rural households' side-businesses. Occasionally, there are specialized vendors who take turns going to the surrounding markets to do small business. In short, the sources of these things are not far away. The next are incense, candles, rattan goods, carts, and leather goods for livestock, old clothes (many Japanese clothes), tin kettles, livestock (cattle, horses, mules, etc.), vegetable seeds, wood, reed mats, and some foreign socks, ribbons, pens, ink, mirrors, tobacco leaves, salted fish, matches, foreign cloth, pottery, tea, tinfoil, paper goods, etc. These handicrafts or manufactured goods, as well as a small amount of raw goods, are estimated to account for about 25% of the value. However, they are transported from farther regions. As for flashlights, toys, ironware, cosmetics such as ribbons, cold cream, powder, etc., as well as kerosene, paint, rubber shoes, etc., are estimated to account for about 25% of the value, almost all of which are foreign goods.</p>
<p>From this rough observation of the goods bought and sold, the former accounts for about 51%. The goods within 100 li do not have any impact on the overall exchange in the market. The food and small amount of supplies sold are only for farmers attending the fair to have temporary drinks or food; the small amount of homespun cloth and cloth shoes are only for those who do not have wives or this type of people to buy. As for the grain sold, it is only for farmers to occasionally exchange to taste the flavors of other grains. As for the second category of incense, candles, rattan goods, carts, and leather goods for livestock, they are only exchanged for special products from farther places, just like the ramie of Jiaxing, the tea of Hangzhou, or the ham of Jinhua, and the silk gauze of Guangdong, which is the same relationship. The most important thing is still the third category of foreign goods (mostly Japanese goods), foreign yarn, cigarettes, and other goods imported from overseas. In the transactions of these goods, such as matches, kerosene, and foreign cloth, they have almost become indispensable daily necessities or luxuries for every farmer.</p>
<p>(Note) For the estimation method, the author counted the number of stalls in the market and also roughly asked about the value of all the goods of each type. When summarized, the answers are roughly as above. As for making a detailed investigation, on the one hand, it is limited by manpower and time, and on the other hand, if you ask every boss of the stall, you will not get an accurate answer either. Regarding this point, the author even thought about the issue of investigation. These are not things that should be said here, but just mentioned in passing.</p>
<p>IV. Conclusion</p>
<p>According to the above brief observation, and further speculating on China's foreign trade in recent years, in the international market, Chinese goods such as the decline of the cotton market, the slump in silk prices, the squeeze on tea, and the lack of prospects for all Chinese industries; however, the import of manufactured goods to supply direct consumers and luxury goods in our country is thriving. In this panic-stricken situation, to put it more clearly, a quarter of the money from the so-called self-sufficient consumption of the Chinese countryside is flowing to foreign countries, which is terrifying, isn't it?</p>
<p>Looking at the overall situation, it is clear that China's current position is that its ailment has penetrated deep into the bone marrow, as if it has become China's incurable cancer. It is not easy to revive such a huge country overnight. Moreover, economic phenomena are intricate and complex, both internally and externally. The method of treatment cannot be closed off, nor can it be completely opened up. It is necessary to carefully observe the internal background and align with the global trends in order to be thorough and meticulous, so that there is a way out. It must be understood that in the economic cycle of international relations, China has become an indispensable link.</p>
<p>Finally, I still want to add one sentence: Only when domestic and foreign affairs are in a completely healthy state can the national industry have the possibility of prosperity. -- (From Professor Stark of Germany, "Hitler," page 140, published by Guangming Bookstore).

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Bulls and Bears Quietly Await Shifts in the Situation</p>
<p>The Bond Market Has Remained Stagnant for a Week</p>
<p>No Trading in October Futures Today Due to Settlement</p>
<p>From October 22nd to 27th last week, the Chinese Securities Exchange was in the period before and after the settlement of October futures, and also the period of tense news about whether the Fifth National Congress could be held as scheduled. Rumors rose and fell from time to time. It was generally believed that there would be major ups and downs. However, most bulls and bears had already swapped positions outside the market, and most of the transactions in the market were done by retail investors. Therefore, the market price fluctuated very little. However, its fluctuations sometimes showed a trance-like and uneasy appearance. Generally speaking, it was just hovering. The future depends on the shifts in the situation, and the market price fluctuations may be larger. Looking back on last week, on Monday, due to rumors that the Fifth National Congress would be postponed and the settlement was gradually approaching, there was a slight sign of squeezing the bulls, and the market price increased slightly by 0.5 yuan. On Tuesday, although the settlement was getting closer, the market became sluggish. The market situation fluctuated up and down, with mutual gains and losses, in very small amounts. On Wednesday, there was a slight squeeze on the bears, especially at the 23rd level, so it rebounded by 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 jiao, etc. Thursday was the last day of October futures, and bulls and bears squeezed each other, but it was very peaceful. The market price was still mutually up and down, with the larger ones around 0.5 yuan. On Friday, due to the announcement of the postponement of the Fifth National Congress, there were unfounded rumors, and the market price fell back by about 0.5 yuan. On Saturday, it fell first and then rose. The Guangdong traders sold a lot, but the market price still rose more and fell less. In short, both bulls and bears were still waiting and watching. November fell by a few jiao to over 1 yuan. The total number of transactions was 88.821 million yuan for spot futures and 160 shares of 5 types of stocks. The results of the increases and decreases are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan, stock unit: 1 share). Today is the settlement date for October futures, and the market is closed for one day.</p>
<p>New York Stock Market in Stillness</p>
<p>According to a report from Xinfeng Foreign Company yesterday (October 27th), the New York clothing market fluctuated very little, and prices were slightly uneven. It was one of the dullest Saturday trades in more than ten years. Both buyers and sellers were waiting for developments and taking a wait-and-see approach. However, due to commercial news favoring the bulls, it showed an upward trend. It is said that movie theaters across the country are doing well, so stocks such as Le were very strong. The stocks of California also improved, presumably because Sinclair's desire to be elected governor will definitely fail. In the small exchange market, Baldwin locomotives again set new lows. The debt market was dull and uneven. US government bonds were loose due to the government's upcoming issuance of a large number of new government bonds, which are expected to be issued around December 15th. Chicago wheat softened due to weekend speculators squaring positions. Half-day turnover was 20 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is as follows:</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>American Cotton Merchants Adopt a Wait-and-See Attitude</p>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market was bleak, and the industry took a wait-and-see attitude. Spot prices did not move, and futures prices fell by 2 to 3 pounds. Indian cotton rose due to purchases by Japanese merchants and speculators in the market. The Pinggu merchant rose by 1.75 rupees, the Aojilax rose by 2.00 rupees, and the Bailuoxi rose by 1.75 rupees. The telegram recorded on the left (dated October 27th)</p>
<h3>Grain</h3>
<p>Most River Rice Prices Rise Slightly</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) The sources from various gangs are still only over twenty (with over 3,000 dan of goods in total). With people's hearts settled and the sales market gradually becoming active, wild rice, white rice, and other thick new japonica rice are selling well in this street, and the market price has risen slightly. However, the new thin rice such as the dense six types and the Baige types have always had a light market. Recently, they have been relying entirely on contracted sales. Today, only the Qingdao gang slightly handled 4 dan for contract sales. It is difficult to see a good show. They are strictly selected and intended for merchants. The central market is even softer. The Yangjian and other types are all because the store market is quite strong and the price has already been low, so it has been raised slightly. The Yinyuan goods are lacking in flavor and stand out by 1 or 2 jiao.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 24 or 25 shipments arrived from various gangs from the rivers downstream and inland. There are over 100 boats stored in the river. In various sales markets in the city, the new japonica rice and high-quality materials are slightly reduced, and the medium and lower grades are handled cleverly. Broken japonica rice and old white yuan stocks are gradually scarce, and the retail market is quite strong. Kiln-grown new Dujian, Yinyuan new Chenbu Kejian are ordinary, and new Yangjian is scarce and selling well. The market shape of new japonica rice and high-quality materials is stable, and the medium and lower grades are slightly tight. The price shape of broken japonica rice, Yinyuan kiln-grown new Dujian, and new Chenbu Kejian is stable. Old white yuan high-quality goods are priced higher by 1 jiao, and the medium and lower grades are similar. Yangjian is priced higher by 1 jiao.</p>

<p>Discussion</p>
<h3>The Crime of Abortion</h3>
<p>— Feng</p>
<p>At the meeting of the Legislative Yuan the other day, the crime of rape of men and the crime of rape of women were discussed, resulting in wasted? The tongues of many committees, and yesterday the crime of abortion was discussed, and the committees had a great tongue-lashing again, resulting in a compromise, which may not be entirely in line with the facts.</p>
<p>Article 283 of the Draft Amendment to the Criminal Law: 1. A pregnant woman who takes medicine or uses other methods to induce abortion shall be sentenced to imprisonment of not more than six months, detention, or a fine of not more than 100 yuan; 2. A pregnant woman who listens to others to induce abortion shall be subject to the same penalty.</p>
<p>Parents love their children more than anyone or anything, the so-called crystallization of love, my flesh, there is no reason to abort without reason, abortion is due to force majeure, or is not allowed by the facts, and the dangerous and painful last resort is taken. Otherwise, they love and protect it too late, even talking about abortion.</p>
<p>There are three reasons for abortion: 1. Illegitimate birth, 2. Inability to raise, 3. Due to illness. Among the three reasons, which one has a reason that can make them not abort? Even if they are not aborted, the born fetus will only be abandoned on the roadside, or become an uneducated vagrant, and increase the pain of the parents, it is better to abort.</p>
<p>Moreover, in view of the current social situation, the first and second are the most numerous, and the third is very rare. Since it is an illegitimate child, it is naturally impossible to give birth in public in the family. If you cannot give birth in public, and you are not allowed to have an abortion, you will either be rejected by the family or despised by the clan. In this way, not only the fetus cannot be preserved, but also the personality and life of the pregnant mother may not be guaranteed. It is to preserve one life and kill two lives. As for the inability to raise and not allowing abortion, not only will there be no ability to support after production, but even if they are raised, they will be an uneducated vagrant, either a bandit or a beggar, either a thief or a vagrant. In such a situation, whether for the sake of the fetus or for the sake of the mother's family, there is no reason to punish them.</p>
<p>A certain committee said that China does not suffer from too many people, but only too few. This is not necessarily the case. China is subject to the economic invasion of imperialists, the bankruptcy of the countryside, and the downturn of industry and commerce, resulting in bandits, thieves, and unemployed and bored people everywhere, and even hungry corpses in ditches. And a certain committee still said that China does not suffer from too many people, but suffers from too few people. Is it that a certain committee only sees the situation in the family, but does not see the situation in society?</p>
<p>Hitler of Germany encourages reproduction, which has his reasons: one is that since the Great War, many people have been sacrificed, and it has not been restored so far; the second is that the country is becoming increasingly prosperous, and it is necessary to increase the number of citizens to work for the country, not suffering from too many people, but only suffering from too few people. The situation in Germany is indeed the case, but what is the domestic situation in our country?</p>
<p>The reasons for abortion are mostly illegitimate births or inability to raise, and very few due to illness. Now, the result of the dispute is only to indicate separately in the case that women with diseases who have abortions after medical diagnosis will not be punished, which is all because they have failed to understand the real situation of society and have acted in accordance with their own intentions. Moreover, the increase in this case seems meaningless. If it is not necessary to be certified by a doctor, it can be said that there is a disease without a disease; if it must be certified by a doctor, it will only be opening up a way for doctors to make money. The spirit of the law is valued, not the form. It is necessary to deeply experience the situation of the people, and there is no need to talk about legal principles and speak official language.</p>
<h3>Father Died</h3>
<p>— Xiao Cen</p>
<p>My father was afraid of death, but he finally died. Immersed in the atmosphere of illness for more than ten years, he was always worried about his own death. He spent thousands of silver on foreign doctors for general diagnosis, invited magicians, worshiped gods and recited Buddhist scriptures, abstained from killing and helped donations. As a result, he confused the source of the disease and became a kind of psychological and non-psychological intangible strange disease. Everyone said he was too afraid of death. He cannot wholeheartedly trust a certain doctor that will lead to today's field.</p>
<p>But no, I don't think my father was afraid of death, he was responsible. Social reality told him that after he died, his wife and a group of unmarried children would be destroyed by society. Although he had spent money to make his younger brother an official, as the saying goes: if you are an official and do things with integrity, your wallet will be empty, and the situation changes a lot. The movement fee was spent, but he still failed to become an official. He had spent money to make his son run out of the gate of the university with a square hat on his head, but the businessman told him: To work in this company, you need a deposit of a thousand silver. Running to the circle of education, I also heard that the number of students is decreasing, and teachers' salaries are being cut. He had taught his daughter to marry a millionaire, but who knew that she had read books and was influenced by the new air, she wanted to talk about freedom and love, and live with a poor boy. Although my father was an old man, he could still understand the general situation of society, and he also understood his children very well, so he took his own death very seriously. My father's fear of death, just like we fear the meaning of death, I don't think his fear is a shameful thing, but rather a commendable point.</p>
<p>When my father was alive, he wanted me to love him more than I loved him. Since I was a child, he didn't treat me as a daughter. He found that I was different from ordinary girls, so at my request, he was responsible for my education expenses, unlike for the other sisters, at most letting them finish elementary school. This was not his favoritism. Under his limited economic power, he had to do this.</p>
<p>But my father finally died. When he was struggling with his last breath, he suddenly called out the name of his daughter who had been separated from him for a long time. My mother was also moved by his cry. She was holding a bowl of hopeful decoction and standing beside him. She was instructed by customary habits and knew that this was an ominous sign, so her tears fell into the bowl. After being stunned for a while, she said: Quick! Tell Uncle Five to send a telegram! Lying on a warm bed, dreaming in Shanghai with the rumbling of car sounds, I was awakened by the sound of knocking on the door, Father died, return quickly! It told me that my father would never see me again.</p>
<h3>Eating Vignettes</h3>
<p>— Lie Huo</p>
<p>After dinner, I gathered with a few colleagues who were quite compatible and talked about everything without any taboos. While we were talking enthusiastically, the cook abruptly came in. His job was to come to report and, secondly, to ask us if we wanted to send two steamed buns to try the flavor tomorrow morning. He said that there was a lot of meat juice in the buns, and the taste was both fresh and cheap. You will know when you try it. Mr. A agreed to send one to try, and Mr. B added another one. The cook was smiling triumphantly, and his eyes narrowed into straight lines. But I said that the buns were all filled with pork head meat, which was full of hair. He was very unhappy when he heard it, did not ask where it fell, turned around and went out.</p>
<p>So our conversation turned to eating, but it was not a serious discussion of the eating problem, also because our group of eating was temporarily solved, although it can’t be investigated in any way.</p>
<p>The first one to talk about it was myself. Our hometown eats three meals of dry rice a day. The morning meal is between 7 and 8 o'clock. In order to save time for cooking, I still remember that when my late mother was alive, she always got up when the cock crowed three times, when the sky was not yet bright, to get out of bed to boil water and wash rice. After eating at 7 o'clock, everyone went to do things separately. Lunch is the same as breakfast. Dinner is more casual. In May and June, when rice is expensive, it is often reduced to just eating some porridge.</p>
<p>Mr. A said: Our hometown is also like this. The difference is that everyone eats porridge at night, because we don’t do anything at night and don’t need a hearty meal.</p>
<p>Mr. B said the same, the same as our hometown, we still eat dry rice for dinner.</p>
<p>At this point, we turned to eating in the metropolis.</p>
<p>The more developed and bigger the metropolis, the more upside down and disordered the time of day and night. Like Shanghai, a morning is offset by more than half of the night. Generally speaking, merchants open the market at nine o'clock, but they close the market at twelve o'clock at night. Many people lie in bed in the morning, but are active and tireless at night. In this way, eating also followed suit. Usually, people only eat some porridge in the morning, some even don't eat it at all, and lunch is convenient as soon as they get up, while the dinner is always eaten very fully, and the time is also extended to after seven or eight o'clock. This is the best explanation for why a metropolis is a metropolis, and it is also the fundamental difference between the lifestyle of a metropolis and the countryside.</p>

<h3>Sister-in-Law Lai Fu</h3>
<p>— Jing</p>
<p>Zhao San's mother, having come out from the house of the big landlord Jing Huanbao Shen Mingqing, was naturally drained of even the strength to take a step. Her frail, tottering body nearly collapsed by Shen Dibaobao's doorstep. Her bronze-colored face grew even paler, frighteningly so, and pearl-like tears streamed down to the wrinkled corners of her mouth.</p>
<p>"Sister-in-Law Lai Fu, is Shen Dibaobao willing to show some leniency? Alas, these days, it's hard to be a person! Even someone as hardworking and dutiful as San's mother is accused of doing things beyond their station." Uncle Changxin, with greying temples, stood under the eaves of his thatched hut, peeling the mud from the newly dug wild water chestnuts. Seeing Zhao San's mother coming out from the Shen's house, he hurried forward to inquire. In truth, he felt that San was wronged this time. He looked at San's mother's thin, pale face, looked at the azure sky without a single floating cloud, and let out an irrepressible sigh.</p>
<p>"Uncle Changxin, isn't that right, like San..." Sister-in-Law Lai Fu couldn't help but sob, tears flowing like a tide, soaking her front. "Great Master says he's too unruly. This time's riot in the four villages, he was the one inciting and leading. This matter is too big, and he can't be bailed out anymore... Uncle Changxin, you know, this is really too unfair to San. How could he have gone to the four villages to incite and lead any ghost, to riot any ghost riot?" Sister-in-Law Lai Fu covered her bronze-colored face with her withered hands, her blue veins as big as earthworms, and cried like a child, her voice hoarse.</p>
<p>"Some time ago, the county specially sent some commissioners to the village to survey the disaster with Great Master Shen, to determine the yield, as your uncle also knows. Our fields were really assessed too high, so San was a bit unconvinced and said he wanted to reason with Great Master Shen. You think, where do we have any reason to argue with the rich and powerful Great Master Shen? Maybe San offended Great Master Shen with his childishness. It was really coincidental. Not long after, riots broke out in the four villages, and San unjustly suffered, with Great Master Shen saying sternly that he was the leader of this riot. In fact, that night, the village gongs rang loudly, only waking San from his dream. He sat up sleepily, even thinking there was a robbery in the village! Uncle Changxin, you are a knowing person..." Sister-in-Law Lai Fu seemed to have found the reason for Shen Dibaobao's misunderstanding of San, and told Uncle Changxin everything, one by one.</p>
<p>"You should quickly go to town and ask Grandpa Zhao Renbing to plead with Great Master Shen. Maybe they have a good relationship and can release San out of his respect. Besides this path, I'm afraid..."</p>
<p>"I've already gone three or four times yesterday, but I can't see him every time. In the end, they won't even let me in the gate..." Sister-in-Law Lai Fu said with some indignation. She felt that her San's life was hopeless, and her disheveled head drooped like branches.</p>
<p>Uncle Changxin couldn't think of any other way either, silently shaking his grey head at the pitiful Sister-in-Law Lai Fu.</p>
<h3>Parting Sorrow</h3>
<p>— Tuoren</p>
<p>At the Queen's Wharf at night, the tall Indian policeman seemed to feel lonely too, standing silently by the railing. The quiet air of the night occupied the entire pier.</p>
<p>The autumn wind blew the leaves on the roadside trees. Yellow leaves, one by one, fluttered in the warm lamplight. Although the street sweeper wasn't there to sweep them away, in an instant, the road was covered with fallen, withered leaves that had left their mother branches. Ah! The autumn wind had finally blown to this beautiful southern island. Autumn scenery was scattered everywhere in this bustling island city!</p>
<p>Ming: Don't walk so fast. Look at these bronze statues. They stand so lonely, how pitiful!</p>
<p>He and Hui walked past the entrance of the courthouse. Hui, as if sensing something, pulled my arm and pointed at the bronze statues standing isolated on the grass, smiling as she said that.</p>
<p>Don't feel sorry for them. Isn't this cheap sea island what they snatched from our map for their motherland? Human loneliness is more pitiful than a bronze statue.</p>
<p>Hui fell silent. She gripped my hand tightly and walked forward. The Queen's Wharf was very close from here. After turning a few bends, we arrived at this quiet pier.</p>
<p>As soon as we stepped into the pier, the tall Indian policeman, as if discovering something, put on that fearsome look in his eyes, staring at us incessantly, as if searching for something frightening on our bodies. Hui was a little scared and clung to me, asking in a low voice: "What is he doing? Looking like that so frighteningly." Just as Hui finished speaking, the Indian policeman suddenly smiled. I looked at Hui and smiled too.</p>
<p>The seaside was just a stretch of quiet. The small steamers going back and forth to the opposite shore seemed tired, letting out weak cries. The sea waves were calm, a thick blue-black expanse, stars leaping in the sea. Hui's rosy face, in the dim moonlight, seemed particularly lovely, but her melancholy eyes were only looking at the flowing clouds in the sky, silently stroking her bright black hair.</p>
<p>Ming: By tomorrow, we'll have to...</p>
<p>She suddenly gripped my hand tightly, her eyes filled with water, also staring straight at my face, seemingly having much to say. But she swallowed it back, only staring at me blankly, as if reminiscing about something she had lost.</p>
<p>Hui, don't stay frozen like this. That ship anchored in the sea, although it will take me away tomorrow, it will also bring me back!</p>
<p>Hui was finally silent. She showed a smile unnaturally, but her heart was beating wildly. She glanced at the ship, then lowered her head to stroke the hem of her dress.</p>
<p>Ming: Okay, be brave tomorrow! You're doing it for your career. I bless you. I hope you'll one day return safely with the joy of the Northern lands. I'll still be here waiting for you.</p>
<p>Hui spoke with mustered courage, but her black, glistening eyes were already soaked with tears. On this single night, I finally parted with Hui, and it has already been five years.</p>
<h3>Carnation</h3>
<p>— Yingying</p>
<p>In the glass window of the Salitini Flower Shop.</p>
<p>The tender red carnation, as bright as the cheeks of a maiden awaiting marriage. The pride of youth is revealed at the corner of her mouth, a beautiful flower!</p>
<p>Outside the glass window of the Salitini Flower Shop, on the high-class flat stone ground.</p>
<p>Four sharpened toe tips of leather shoes move over! From the edge of a garment that resembles the tender red carnation flower color, covering the smaller toe caps of the two leather shoes, one can imagine what the color of the clothing above should be!</p>
<p>Tender red flat sleeves hang loosely on the sleeves of a deep black red garment, much like a beautiful cane.</p>
<p>Turning back her fine hair, there is a beautiful mouth where the same pride of youth as the carnation is condensed!</p>
<p>—Isn't it beautiful!</p>
<p>—Darling, why don't we buy one of these to take back?</p>
<p>Toe tips walk over, touching the stones in front of the glass window.</p>
<p>Slender fingers, thick fingers, point inside at the same time!</p>
<p>(Carnation is sad, what does it seem to be!—Every time, every time, slender fingers, or thick fingers, hover in front of one's body like this without going away, it is sure to take one's life away!</p>
<p>Is that woman not beautiful enough? Why is it that even beautiful women do not want to let go of the responsibility of helping people of the same destiny to become even more beautiful?</p>
<p>Judging from the look, it must be a young girl awaiting marriage! Otherwise, why would that lip hide so many words that cannot be spoken?</p>
<p>That girl, why isn't she sad? In the blink of an eye, she will be a woman who loses the right to be proud of her youth! Look: Smiling with those enticing teeth!</p>
<p>But, Miss, I hope you can show some compassion and not bring me in too! Even though you have an unhappy happiness in front of you, you know that I have prayed and helped to relieve you of it——but there is no way, because this is still something you are willingly doing yourself.)</p>
<p>—Buy this, look, how beautiful this carnation is!</p>
<p>The man is feeling for money. The boss is even more attentive, opening the window.</p>
<p>(The fate that cannot be avoided will inevitably suffer.</p>
<p>The carnation's sorrow, what does it seem, is shedding tears!</p>
<p>Beautiful girl, one day the youth that I promised will end together)</p>
<p>The beautiful carnation is tightly pressed against the girl's chest: tightly,</p>
<p>(Miss, let's bless ourselves!)</p>

<h3>Six Hundred Yuan IOU</h3>
<p>Editor Sir:</p>
<p>I have a very good friend, he owes a lot of debts outside, and can't account for them to his family. Because I visit his home very frequently, his family knows my handwriting, so he repeatedly begged me to write him an IOU, falsely claiming that I lent him six hundred yuan, so he could take it home to explain. Because of our friendship, I couldn't refuse, so I wrote an IOU for him according to his wishes. I wrote the names of two friends on the IOU, as witnesses and intermediaries, but these two friends didn't know about this, so they didn't sign it. Now he has taken this IOU home to account for it, and I have no way to get it back. If I were to ask him to write another note proving that the IOU is false, that would be too much of a display of distrust. But now I also think that the feelings between friends can't be said to never change. If we ever have a disagreement, will he use this IOU to demand money from me? At that time, would I have an obligation to repay the debt? Or can I find a way to deny it and seek legal remedies? Please take some time to answer these questions for me in the newspaper. With best wishes for your well-being,</p>
<p>Sincerely, Zhang Yong</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Mr. Zhang seems too loyal to his friend. Although one should help friends solve difficulties, one should also consider what kind of situation it is. When Mr. Zhang wrote the note, he should have first known whether the money that this friend owed was for legitimate use. If he owed it because of illegitimate use, then writing this kind of IOU for him would be aiding the wicked, which would be a mistake. Although the two are on good terms now, if there is a rift one day, then Mr. Zhang is in danger of having to repay the debt according to the IOU. In theory, Mr. Zhang is not responsible for this matter, but it will be difficult to distinguish if a lawsuit arises. Based on the nature of what you said, if you want to remedy this in terms of personal relations, the only thing to do is to quickly retrieve the note, or ask him to write another note for you explaining the situation. It is best to have someone sign as a witness. This will not harm the friendship, because this is not distrusting your friend, but really distrusting your friend's family, fearing that his family will take that six hundred yuan IOU at any time and ask Mr. Zhang for money.</p>

<p>Opening Chapter "Watching Movies"</p>
<p>Recently, movies are most popular. Movie theaters open densely like clouds. In the French and British concessions, North and South Cities, it's hard to count how many there are. The time is only for more economical reasons. Each show only takes two hours. Unlike ordinary big theaters, where one sits for six hours and feels very bored. Cathay and Grand Cathay are originally the most respected on the sea. New Light, Guanglu, and Lyceum theaters. Summer is paired with Peikekaerden. The seats are indeed satisfactory. North and South Capitals are divided into North and South. New and Old Central are divided into Old and New. All of them show clearly Western films. Three shows a day are all like this. Inside are all dark lips. Modern men and women are in pairs. Side by side, enjoying themselves happily. Sometimes when they see kissing and hugging, both bare hearts are burning hot. They wish they could transform into the people in the movie. Some kick with their feet and grip with their hands. They don't know what they're saying in the moment of excitement. So, the electric ray is so effective at bewitching people. Social education has great power. It is most pitiful that young people in the world value love.</p>

<p>Opening Crab</p>
<p>Xiao Su's reeds fight the autumn wind. Sha Yuan Maple Dan dots and dyes the craftsmanship. Frost's letter urges people that autumn is not yet old. The reckless son has already been called the boss. You are at home everywhere in the lakes and seas, happy. There is a miracle in the Crystal Palace. The general's badge can be inherited. Once a year he is awarded with honor. Wearing armor and walking sideways to boast about the winter. Taking advantage of the tide to come and go like a group of fierce ones. The turbulent river water chases fish and turtles. Self-seeking troubles compete for autumn appearance. Suddenly, the yellow flowers by the fence see with cold eyes. He opens his face and smiles to celebrate meeting again. He says that you were born a month late this year. You should learn more than before. I envy the flowers of autumn light competing to bloom. The flags are corners and fences with a cluster of white flowers. You can go swaggering at the right time. The world is full of thorns and you must learn to have a clear summary. However, the young master has no intestines and no insight. He has no resistance when he sees the fisherman. It is still proudly in the waterside village. The time cloud blue robe is taken off, his whole body is red. What is precious about being reckless throughout his life? It is all in people's hands. The ignorant young master enters the cage.</p>
