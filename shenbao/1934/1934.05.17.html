<p>— 英</p>
<p>日本自四一七發表宣言以來。其企圖把持中國對外一切關係之形勢。旣已十分明顯因之對於在華投資領導之拉西曼計劃自必出於全力搏戰此則我國人民及國際方面所公認者也。試觀日昨東京華聯電訊。『日使有吉决於本月二十三日離日赴滬對華重要政策之。一將爲極力提倡中日經濟關係。由華北着手工作。長江華南亦可同時進行。』則知日本之所求於中國者。實爲絶對的關鎖主義。且有不惜與各國一拚之勢於此之時國際對華援助與合作之前途果將依何種方式以解决之乎。國聯之顧問委員會現方在日内瓦開會。對於技術合作代表拉西曼之報告又將採何種有效步驟以期其現實乎。日本又將出何種方法以對付之乎。均與此問題之變化有密切之關係焉。</p>
<p>夫國際對華援助與合作。由發展生產之觀點以言。固似無可非難之事。但其若何實現則性質顯有不同。從而其結果所獲。亦不必一致。蓋國家爲進行生產起見。對於外國所供給之物資。無論爲現金與貨物。有採交換方式者。有採『投資』方式者。亦有採投資方式而同時則進行大量的直接資本輸入者。在特定意義之下。以上諸方式。皆可名曰『國際合作。』然對於國民經濟所給予之效力與結果。則絶對不能相同凖此以言。則物資之多寡何若。供給者之來源何若遂均不能視爲國家進行生產計劃成敗之絶對先决條件。已彰彰明甚矣。今就我國情形而論。外國物資之援助。是否爲絶對先决條件。論者固不一其說。惟以吾人觀察。則以爲物資之多寡。與夫來源之出自何方。似均可不必細爲推敲。所當研究者。㈠爲外國物資輸華以後。對於實行生產計劃。果將如何以發展正常之效能㈡外國物資輸華之擔保。果可無須提供實際之『合法權益』否。㈢外國於援助對華生產之際是否能逐漸收縮其對華直接輸出資本之計劃凡此三者皆爲利用外國物資之前提。而宜深切研究者。倘此三者不能於國家爲有利之解决則所謂發展生產計劃尙不能視爲完滿之計劃也。</p>
<p>由上以言。我國利用外國物資之中心問題。不在於供給來源之何自。實已彰彰明甚。然而國際方面。則竟因此來源問題而發生絶大之波瀾。日本方面所念念不忘者。以爲國聯之片面進行。有違其門羅主義之原則。而我國則多主張非與國聯合作。不足以破獨呑之計。果將何去何從乎。惟有待於事實之推移矣。今所不容忽視者。卽國聯萬一堅决執行『不承認』主義。日本之實際行動。果將何若。觀於近日日方所傳種種消息則知日本之積極威脅大有一舉手而撕毁拉西曼報告之勢則國聯於此對於國際物資援助計劃果能無視日本之力量一意進行而不别圖改頭換面之計劃乎。此誠我國人所當注意之問題也。</p>

<p>（日内瓦）列强代表今日實際上已贊成將國聯主持之軍縮會議、無期延會、故全世界卽有開始軍備競爭之危險、軍縮委員總會於五月廿九日召集時、將正式宣告軍縮之失敗、而將軍縮問題移交國聯行政院、然此不過例行手續而已、據政治觀察者稱、唯一希望卽在今日午後、列强贊同請求行政院另委一特别委員會、考查全世界之軍縮趨勢、以待萬一形勢好轉時、再使軍縮會議復活、然卽此一綫希望、亦甚屬渺茫也、據國聯方面消息、行政院卽將討論軍縮主席漢德森之報告、該報告將列舉失敗之理由、俟此報告接受後、行政院再行派定特别委員會云、聞該委員會將由美·日·俄·英等國代表組成、美國對歐陸事件、素抱旁觀態度、然如進行順利時、美國當亦樂於倡導之也、據稱、此項新發展或有可能、因漢德森氏昨與各代表一度會商、結果尙佳也、參加昨日會議者計有英掌璽大臣艾登·美國軍縮觀察代表威爾遜·意代表阿樂西·法外長巴爾都等、惟據一般人之意見、彼等對於列强將軍縮會議無期延會之决定、不致有何影響云、（十六日國民電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）首相麥唐納並不出席軍縮會議、與最近外間所傳者相反、下議院自由黨議員曼德曾向首相提出下列問題、『在軍縮會議現况之下、首相是否認爲最努力爲不可少、所謂最後努力者、如首相親自出席之例是也、其次英政府内部對於軍縮應取之政策、是否尙未同意、予敢敬問首相』云云、麥唐納對此問題、置不作答、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>故宮盜寳案　　馬衡主張嚴查　珠寳被盜價値百餘萬元</h3>
<p>北平通訊、故宮博物院院長馬衡眞除後、對於院務將有革新、茲紀其狀况如次、</p>
<h3>盜寳問題</h3>
<p>古物盜換案、業經法院派員分别調查物證、該案除朝冠鳳冠便帽上所嵌之珠寳被盜換外、尙有珠翠鈿　　飾翠珠佛冠、嵌珠寳金頂髮冠、嵌珠盔、嵌珠淸凉冠、及帶珠旗頭等、其數甚夥、珠翠鈿飾有每頂上嵌珠一百餘粒者及珠串雙龍戲大珠帽條多件、上嵌之珠寳、亦皆不翼而飛、其餘如順治乾隆等珍珠朝珠若干串、大小珍珠約半箱、珠寳若干包若干袋均被盜換殆盡、據考古家估計、價値一百餘萬元、故宮博物院院長馬衡對此、主張嚴查、否則無法淸理古物、至於此種大批有價値之古物被盜、是否在滬保管不得法、抑古物南運時之不週密、尙待詳細調查、</p>
<h3>陳列古物</h3>
<p>故宮古物南運部分、本擬先在南京設立庫房、將存滬之古物、有關歷史文獻者遷入、次建南京分院、將存滬之大部分古物、運往陳列、但不易成爲事實、原因有二、㈠南京不易覔得相當院址、㈡無經費可建分院、故上届理事會未討論此項問題、北平故宮博物院自古物南遷後、先開放中路、次西路、現則東路亦開放、中路開放日期、爲每星期四·星期日、西路爲每星期一·五、東路爲每星期三·六、星期二休息、</p>

<h3>馬衡談話</h3>
<p>據故宮博物院院長馬衡談稱、本人二月前、卽向行政院辭職、當時各界對本人此舉、諒解與不諒解者參半、諒解者謂故宮責重事繁、辭職亦爲讓避賢路之一法、不諒解者則以故宮爲重要之文化機關、不可無人負責、總之、此二者之動機、均出於愛護故宮、汪院長（精衛）促余打銷辭意、勉爲其難、困難問題、由理事會恊助解决、故余打銷辭意、暫行復職、同時希望汪院長再物色院長人選云、</p>
<h3>更動職員</h3>
<p>依照故宮新組織、薦任科長八人至十一人、委任科員一十八人至三十六人、現應增委科員十餘人、新組織規定辦事員十六人至三十六人、現辦事員甚多、應裁撤十餘人、院長馬衡前因代理性質、未裁職員現已正式眞除、不久將更動一部分職員、又因故宮職員、多半爲前院長易培基之湖南同鄕、所謂湘派、馬氏接任後、對於湘派職員、極感難於應付、（十五日）</p>

<h3>奥飛姆大戲院　昨晨突然坍倒　延及戲院後市房幸未傷人　公安局將令全部拆毁重建</h3>

<h3>事後調查</h3>
<p>出事之後、卽經該管六區公安局及曹家渡救火會閘北救火會等、前往調查坍倒原因實因建築太劣又因該戲院之水　構置不完備、使屋頂兩旁接筍之洋松木、滲入潮水遂逐漸腐爛於是屋頂失其憑藉之力、遂致坍倒、又觀測得該戲院之後牆欹斜特甚、亦有將行搖墜之勢、故公安局擬令該戲院從速拆去重造、否則將吊銷其執照云、</p>

<p>讀書問答</p>
<h3>關於哲學上幾個基一問題的檢討（二）</h3>
<p>（昨天將盛吉甫君提出的第二問題『同一性』的内容約略的討論過了，今天再繼續解說『統一性』的内容。編者）</p>
<p>『統一』的英文名詞是Ｕuity和前說抽象的同一是對立的。但也包含了同一的意義。惟這裏的固一，乃是具體的同一：什麽呌做具體的同一呢？就是說這個同一中涵藏着差别，矛盾，運動，變化等等的原素，舉個例來說吧，『抗日』『反帝』，這兩者有同一的性質，但我們不能忽視其中的差别，矛盾，運動，及變化。抗日是抵抗日本帝國主義的侵略，反帝是反對一切帝國主義的侵略，如以爲抗日就是反帝而忽視了反抗其它帝國主義對中國的瓜分運動，結果必然是希望聯絡别的列强來帮助中國去制裁日本，（中國有許多人懷着倚賴國聯的心理，就是基於這種錯誤的認識上面的，）（自然也還有别的原因）在這樣的運動中，抗日的意義就會發生變化。變化成不是反抗日本侵略中國，而是歡迎各帝國主義共管中國。這種變化，在抽象同一性的認議下是看不見的。而在具體的統一性認識下，却能原原本本的反映出來。予我人與抗日反帝的實際行動，有多方面的凖備，把握着更大勝利的可能。再舉一個例罷，譬如一九一七年的俄國二月革命，是工人農民和資產階級共同推倒『沙爾主義』通俗的說可稱爲沙皇專制主義）要求自由解放的，民主革命的各階級的統一戰綫，但並不是說他們之問毫無差别矛盾的同一，更不是說資產階級的利益，就完全等於農民的利益，又完全等於工人的利益·固然爲求得自由解放的利害是同一的《（運正是統一戰綫成立的基礎）故工人農民和盗產階級，皆組織其本階級的力量來參加革命，而各階級間的差别，矛盾是無數的多，他們在這一革命中，各自努力要求獲得大的戰利品，工人農民和兵士要求組織蘇維埃（卽代表會之意）資產階級却要求立憲會議，工人農民和兵士運用一切才能來武裝自已，强大本階級的力量；資產也要求强大自的力量；工農兵士羣衆要求馬上停止帝國主義大戰，要求和平麵包與自由；資產階級却要繼續參加對德戰爭。工人農民要根本推翻舊社會的秩序，佔領工廠，没收土地，資產與前者相反。（少數派忽視了階級間的差異矛盾，做了資產階級的尾巴。多數派認清了這些，把握住革命的轉變性，領導工農暴動，）從這些階級間的差異，矛盾，發展成爲工農兵『變塹壕戰爲國内的階級戰』的行動，克倫斯基的資產階級政府，近就開始逮捕屠殺工農了。這一直發展下去，造成十月革命，這時已不是資產階級與工農的統一戰綫了，分裂爲後者與前者的對立了。</p>
<p>再舉一個最淺白的例來說罷譬如國家，這是一個抽象的槪念。無論英國，法國，德國，美國，蘇聯，阿富汗，暹邏，等等皆是國家，其間有君主立憲，民主立憲，有法西蒂專政，有工農專政等諸差别，綜合起來，則有資本主義的國家和社會主義的國家，因種種政制的不同，其問之矛盾衝突那是顯然的。前者與後者矛盾，形成反蘇聯的戰爭，卽前者的各個國家問也有矛盾，形成帝國主義的相互間戰爭。又如以中國的軍閥戰爭來說，三年前的軍閥戰爭，與三年後的軍閥戰爭，固然還是同一的軍閥戰爭，但其中顯有差别及矛盾的深淺之不同。如因馮閻所舉起的北平臨時政府而爆發魯豫戰爭，和最近的閩戰，其意義是不同的。前者還是以擁護三民主義做旗幟，後者竟然是反對三民主義了。</p>
<p>總之對於事物槪念形態的諸　認議上，祇是有抽象的同一，而抛了其中一切種種的，五光十色的，活潑生動，多方面的具體事實（甚至一絲一毫之徵）都是不正確的，那是哲學的觀念論（卽唯心論）。</p>
<p>其實宇宙間一切事物，都没有完全相等的東西。卽今天的我，就不完全等於昨日的我，明天的我也不完全等於今天昨天的我。你也這樣，他也這樣，任何人都是一樣。所謂『統一性』就是不抛棄抹殺『同一的分裂及充滿矛盾部份的具體認議』。這就是辦證法的本質。</p>
<p>從以上的角釋中，可以相當地帮助讀者去理解，問一性與統一性的分别了吧？（未完）</p>

<h3>昔日威風而今安在　我國排球隊竟敗於日　一比三敗得眞悽慘　無合作爲失敗主因</h3>
<p>（本報馬尼拉十六日專電）今日我國排球隊、竟爲日本所敗、全隊無合作工夫、爲失敗之原因、比賽情形如下、</p>
<p>日本｛二十二比二十二十七比二五十五比二十一二十二比十七｝中國</p>
<p>第一局我隊因無合作、雖先得分、日本仍以十一比八、佔先上半局、下半局競爭甚烈、分數相等者達四次、二十比二十一、日本居前一分時、我國一記殺球、過重出界、遂以二十比二十二失第一局</p>
<p>第二局　接戰更烈、上半時我隊以十一比十多一分、中間曾因三次觸網、損失三分、甚爲可惜、下半局我隊屢以二分居先、復成各十八、十九、二十、二十一、二十二、二十三、二十四、二十五、之九次平手、卒因無耐性、爲日本獲得最後之二分、二十五比二十七、又失第二局、</p>

<h3>提倡國貨的賢長官</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>提倡國貨，不是時髦事，也不是敷衍門面事，是要有實心實力的去幹，要有身居高位的以身作則的去做，纔有效果。</p>
<p>最近和陳布雷先生談話，他說：『提倡國貨，最最熱心的，要推浙江省政府的魯主席。一魯主席的服用國貨，是笨做的，是『自我實現』的，這位魯老先生他自已也承認只有笨做的方法，去提倡國貨，國貨纔有希望。他要人家先信任他的話，他便從自已公署和家庭中公開的檢點一下，他先自把許多用具標起記號來，完全是國貨的，是用紅環做記號，外貨是用綠環做記號，不純粹是國貨的，用藍環做記號。檢點好了，把非國貨的，一槪標價拍賣，誓不服用。有一天，他特嗎國貨商塲中凖備署中家中應用的物品，說明絶對都要國貨，後來發現中間還有一種物品，不是國貨，他便呌了塲中商人，大大的斥責一番，認爲不應欺罔國人誤人誤國來和國貨作對，這種實心實力提倡國貨的賢長官，很可以提出來頌揚一番。</p>
<p>可以布雷先生，他也是主張絶對服用國貨的一人，他看見許多靑年子弟，喜歡用洋紙，鋼筆，墨水寫字，他大大的不以爲然，認爲中國各地產紙豐富，有毛筆，有松烟墨，樣樣都備，何心要去用洋紙，洋筆，洋墨水，來替外國人廣銷路呢？所以他做浙江敎育廳長時候，他便是要呌各校學生天天練幾頁楷書，陳先生家裹的人通起信來絶對要用中國箋封，中國毛筆寫字，陳先生說，這樣一來，祇少可以多推銷一些國貨，他說：『提倡國貨，總要有幾分獃氣，和幾分勇氣，才有效果。』這種話是多麽的澈底，尤其是值得紀載的。記者很希望各省各縣都有這樣的賢長官，國貨前涂，便有很好的結果。</p>
<p>國貨談話</p>
<h3>公路建設與國貨推銷</h3>
<p>— 憶鳳</p>
<p>因爲交通不便，運輸困難，以致内地市塲的發展，受到了相當阻碍，這是誰都知道的事實；所以要繁榮内地市塲，必先要開拓交通，解除運輸上的一切難題。但就目前中國的財力人力而言，這公路建設，設是解除這困難的最有效的捷徑。</p>
<p>最近據經濟委員會公路處的工作報告，和各省的修築路綫的消息，知道現正在積極的計劃着七省公路的聯絡。無疑的，將來計劃告成，内地的物產，自可因此而廉價的到都市來暢銷：但同時洋貨勢力的侵入，若不設法防範，其結果也頗足驚人。據福建建陽某軍事機關通訊，有『敝部駐防閩北，將及五載，深感交通不便，致民智蔽塞，商業衰落····在城間卽覺日用品缺乏，雖稍有貨的，多爲外貨，且係由福州轉來，成本高，運輸難，而價值奇昻，敝部現奉令用兵工築路，預計五月底可完成建浦，建崇，建甌，建光，建陽爲四路之中心，運輸之樞紐，商塲發展，指日可期，恐届時外貨充斥，費盡官兵血汗，不啻代外貨譬一銷貨市塲，言之殊學痛心』等語。我們看了這段通訊，知道目前公路的建設，是急不容緩，而洋貨的侵入，也不得不加以注意。</p>
<p>際此滬上國貨廠商，正在着手預備收復内地市塲的時候，若能乘此時機，在公路沿綫的重要市鎭，多設些推銷國貨的機關，那末，公路的建設，未始不是個國貨推銷上的有力的奥援；不然，坐視洋貨勢力的以運輸便利而成本减低的機會，得以在内地猖獗，則内地市塲雖因此而或能日臻繁盛，但與國家，與民族，究有何補呢！</p>
<h3>怎樣使國貨到農村去?</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>上期的本刋，有一篇關於『國貨到農村去』的討論文字，我覺得在這國貨年裹面，却是一件值得討論的事情。</p>
<p>國貨爲什麽需要到農村去？國貨是不是需要到農村去？這是一個值得研究的問題、有人說：『國貨不需要到農村去，因爲農村中的農民，大部份都是用自已所製造出來的東西，如身上究的士布呀，家中用的雜件呀等等，假如國貨到了農村以後，豈不是反而促十貨的壽命，而使農村加速度的破產嗎？』這種論調，我們粗聽着，似乎是對的，可是，細細地想了一想，都是一個謬誤的觀念。</p>
<p>事實告訴我們，近年來的劣貨傾銷，已到了一個十分緊急的時候，而且日貨的傾銷，不僅注意於我國的都市，同時，更從重於我國的農村，我們祗要跑到農村中去看看，便可知道這個危機，已到了如何緊張的程度了，農民大部份都已採用洋貨了，尤其是劣貨，把服用國貨的意義，說給他們聽，反而要覺得累贅呢？我們想：這個危機，危險不危險？這個形勢，緊張不緊張？所以，請國貨到農村去，是一件很緊要的事情。怎樣使國貨到農村去？我曾想過許多方法，轉過許多念頭，覺得如能從下列數項入手，一定能收相當的效果，予劣貨以重大的打擊。</p>
<p>（一）分設國貨公司支店　年來提倡國貨，創辦不不少的國貨公司但是這許多國貨公司，大部份都在都市，我以爲在各處鄕鎭也，應多多開設國貨公司的支店，使一般民衆，减少購買劣貨之機會。</p>
<p>（二）國貨應抱薄利政策　查農民購買劣貨的機動，最大的原因，還是在於價格的低廉，故國貨欲與劣貨競爭，而深入農村，更須在可能範圍之中，减低貨物的售價，而抱薄利多銷政策，能如此，庶可因價格的適令農民購買力，而增進他們服用的興趣。</p>
<p>（三）應多開展覽會與演講會　在農村中的農民，大都是寡陋寡聞的，他們不知道那種是國貨？那種是非國貨？所以，負提倡國貨之責者，和許多國貨機關，應多開展覽會於農村，並舉行演講會使農民之心目中，有『國貨』二字，同時，使他們知道服用國貨之意義。</p>
<p>（四）設國貨巡廻車　各大國貨工廠，國貨公司，大可設立國貨巡廻車，車上安置各種國貨若干件，僱人向農村中巡廻，並負宣傳國貨的責任，這種方法，也是能收若干效果的，婦女國貨年運動委員會，已在開始製造這種巡廻車，很希望早日實現，更希望能到農村中去巡廻</p>

<h3>滬西國貨臨時商塲揭幕拾零</h3>
<p>— 秋紅</p>
<p>滬西國貨商場設靜安寺路底爲婦女國貨年運動委員會所主辦，就聖喬治舞場之遺址，架木屋數十間，上覆鉛皮，殊覺風緻别具。參加店舖，幾逹百數，佈置以家庭工業社，金浪公司，景綸衫襪廠等數家，最擅勝塲，似經過相當之籌劃者。塲内遍佈煤屑，來往婦女，高跟皮鞋頗感</p>
<p>行走不便</p>
<p>步步費力，加以陽光强烈，故無不嬌喘汗出，揭幕時以綢帶橫攔於出入大門前，有某店女職員乘人力車來，格於綢帶，不得入塲，乃下車從綢帶下鑽過。</p>
<p>鞠躬而進</p>
<p>時觀行揭幕禮者，　集門前，見該女子有届身而入，竟人在六高呼鞠躬如也，聞者莞爾。待本市市長吳鐵城夫人以剪刀割斷紅綢帶後，揭幕大典便告禮成，於樂聲抑揚中，門外觀衆，蜂擁而入。華美烟公司所據小屋，適對塲之中門，有往買該公司出品滿洋兩圓者，該公司贈以</p>
<p>標凖美人</p>
<p>徐來照片一張，其人反覆審視，遽問店員曰，有蝴蝶否？旁一人亟代答曰，蝴蝶今日未到，標凖美人之倩影亦殊不惡也。記者在五分鐘内，見該公司贈出明星照片有十二張之多，商塲内除供給日常用品之各店舖外，有佛學書局之磬鐘琉璃燈等</p>
<p>僧人法器</p>
<p>出售，一孩童堅欲市一紅漆木魚，其母不得已，乃購念佛珠一串，繞其孩頸上，其狀頗類幼年時代之漙儀。吳市長夫人自環行參觀後，卽偕其秘書等乘自備汽車而去，後至者尙頻詢市長夫人芳踪不已也。</p>

<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著　秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>至於文書方面的事務，那是更少了，丨簡直是没有。本來，這種吃飯不做事的美缺，原是慶善存心照顧他那些親戚的，因爲他那些親戚都是很懶的脚色，雖然想賺錢，却不願實實在在的工作，於是各人都利用着親戚的關係，强迫慶善安挿他們。這一種情形在中國，可說是很普通的，無論那一個人，只要他自已弄到了一個可以有權用人的位置以第，他的那些親戚故舊，便立刻會把他包圍起來，强迫他盡量的引用私人，多多益善。而在滿清官塲中，這種情形是尤其的善遍。</p>
<p>我二哥當然也不能例外，他的隨員究竟有多少，我雖不知確數，但是我可以保證他們除了部坐着談天之外，斷没有别的工作了。其實富二哥引用他們的時候，原來也不希望他們做什麽工作。這樣讀者就不難想見我們家裏的情形了，不但我二哥有這麽許多淸客式的隨員，便是我四弟，也照樣有好幾個養着，我父親所有的是更多了；這三起人馬合併後的總數，至少就有二三十名了。所以無論我們自已的屋子怎樣大，或是向人家租下的屋子怎樣大，却永遠不會有空的房間了。而且往往不够。在這種情形之下，我父親，我二哥，或四弟，便得另外再化一筆錢，到外面去租些屋子，好讓這些寄生蟲們安居。</p>
<p>話雖如此，在朝廷上也全虧那些金玉其外，敗絮其中的大臣，穿着得花花綠綠的肅立着，才能點綴成一種雍容華貴的氣象；而在這一次的旅途中，又全虧了勛齡和慶善的這些隨員們點綴其間，方不致盡失朝廷風度。（三五）</p>
<h3>開快車</h3>
<p>— 錢醉竹</p>
<p>公共體育塲和蘇州人民，向來似乎不發生什麽關係？儘管望衡對宇的『公園』，擠得水洩不通，而在體育塲裏運動，却寥寥可數。或者賸幾個孩子，在裏頭點綴着。</p>
<p>可是在我今天走過的時候，却情形一變。冷寂的體育塲上，圍了一個風雨不透。我爲好奇心驅使着，也擠了進去。</p>
<p>『這兩個學生，已跑了二十一個圈子，眞本事！』一個</p>
<p>袖手旁觀的看客驚歎着。</p>
<p>『我聽見說，要跑四十圈呢，怎不怕累？』另一個這樣回答。</p>
<p>我望對面看時，果然有兩個靑年，遠遠地跑來，地下還有石灰畫的跑道。我心想想這許是萬米練習吧。正想着忽聽一陣掌聲，從另一個人堆裏送過來。一望而知是在作撑竿跳呢。</p>
<p>這裏有七個靑年在比賽着：看他們從二·○八公尺，逐步上升，初時是很輕鬆地悠然而過，加到二米五六公尺高時，却祇賸兩人競爭，但爲跑步上的關係，勝利終屬於那個有『蘇工』二字的標識的靑年，而『二五二』號那一位是失敗了。</p>
<p>同時，那籃球塲上，還競爭得很熱烈，而那萬米練習的兩位靑年，也還在起勁的跑着。</p>
<p>當我走出塲門時，忽從身後飛來了一名話：『想不到我們的快車，開到野外了。</p>
<p>我猛然想起，遠東運動大會，正在菲律賓舉行着。</p>
<p>爲國爭光的健兒們，我預祝你們開特快車。</p>
<h3>牡丹開了嗎</h3>
<p>— 何如</p>
<p>中國有名俗　：『三月三看牡丹。』北平人加了一句『崇效寺看牡丹。』這因爲牡丹是崇效寺最好，每逢春暮，有閒的士大夫階級，都是携酒提榼，作盡日的盤桓。現在的北平，風雨飄搖，一日數驚，那還有什麽心腸去看牡丹。然而我是中國第一個閒人，年紀已有五十多了。正好學那徐霞客遍游天下。又因爲北平一處住房，是先曾祖所遺留，我家居住在内，不知多少年。出京之後，便交與家人們看管。我家雙桐軒有十幾株牡丹，有的是先曾祖在洛陽縣移來的，有的是先祖在台州府署移來的，有的是先君在廣西學政任内帶來的，有的是我在安徽宣城買來的。要講牡丹，我家雙桐軒的牡丹，雖不能算海内第一，在北平說亦駕乎崇效寺之上。只因平津的危險，房子我想賣了，牡丹因爲歷代先人所遺留與我一生的愛護，就要像政府搬運古董，被搬運到南方來，豈不妙哉！不料竟因此釀出意外的風潮，昨天到了北平丞相胡同，開了雙桐軒的門，到花臺上看那牡丹，原是十三株，現在只存了五株，雖然含苞未放，花也欣欣有喜色，知道主人遠首歸來，特意的開了一株。只是那株宣城木本的牡丹，忽然又在半夜裏失去。並且有人寫信警告，竟成了一件大笑話。現在我的房子不賣了，牡丹不搬了。聽天由命，多一事不如少一事的好。本來有人請我到崇效寺去看牡丹，不高興去了，仍舊回來作我的租界的寄生蟲。</p>

<h3>手工紙業之新生活</h3>
<p>— 天虚我生</p>
<p>小滿節届，内地造紙業者，多於此際砍取新竹淹作一年之用，吃本較重，而工作迂緩，無怪其售價之不能廉也。其實老竹亦能造紙，徒以墨守成法，不知利用化學，故老竹不能應用，若改新法造漿，卽可常年造出紙漿，以資周轉，茲述如左：</p>
<p>假定原設紙槽，每日能出十件之紙，每年出三千件，備料一千担，每担以五元論，需本五千元，造成紙後，在銷出時，每担得丈五元，適核對本對利，每月所得餘利，至多不過五百元耳，每件工資以二元論，卽三百件需六百元，若改新法造漿，專令固有人工，抄出紙片，不拘厚薄破碎，均可變錢姑以五倍出數計之，卽每日能出五十件，每件工資只核四角而已。每日用料二十担，則一千担料，不過兩個月已可用完，變出現錢，以資周轉，一年六轉，每轉丈五千元，可得三萬元矣。但紙漿核利，不能如此之重，致不能與木漿競爭，亦當减爲五分之一，卽每担料丈一元，每日廿担，已能丈七千元一年，比之手工出紙，其利有三，試更舉述以明之。</p>
<p>（一）產竹之區，本只銷於一時，假定原銷一萬元者，今可銷六萬元矣。此於山户有六倍之收益，而售價卽可减輕，如係判山論年，則尤合算，常年采用，卽不必於一時之間，盡情收割，則雇用長工，亦必較爲便宜，因老竹亦能造紙、固不必在一霎問同時工作也。</p>
<p>（二）如上所述，卽產量不成問題，而銷數可增六倍，卽當用六倍之人工，原容千人者，今可容六千人矣。此於農民生活，大有利益者也。</p>
<p>（三）設紙槽者，原有人工，仍可照常工作，不妨悉照舊法，以免疑慮，只須另以五千元之資本，兼用新法造漿，作爲副業，抄工不用内行，卽凡不學之徒，亦能撈出厚薄不拘，破碎無妨之紙片，任用何法，或晒或烘，或竟帶水運出，與機廠合作，卽可另收一筆厚利。此在紙槽上容内人工，亦增不少，而資本家所得之利，則又迅速而免遷緩，固何憚而不爲。</p>
<p>至與機廠合作之法，亦正不妨小試，以袪雙方之疑慮。假如先裝竹料若干，派人到廠，眼同工作，一方可以實習工程，一方可以核見出紙若干，用去煤電工本若干，卽與訂立合作契約，核定拆帳成數，不論何人銷出，均可按成派分各得其利，各計盈虧兩無牽掣。此等合作，實爲天公地道之法，可無爾詐我虞之弊，廠家必願爲之，但小試一次，非有五六百担之料不可，少卽無法上機，至於造成之紙，不論如何，總可變錢，乘此新竹收割時期，卽用石灰淹料，出運一批，亦頗輕而易舉，何不爲之？農村破產之呼聲，洋洋盈耳，顧無一人肯爲地方上闢一利源，譬之有田不種，而向天號饑，其愚誠不可及。大抵眼光太淺，只就小處着想，羣思利已而損人，以攫奪爲目的，不肯爲利人兼以利已之事，此誠手工業家之一大病因耳。</p>

<h3>一思而行</h3>
<p>— 曼雪</p>
<p>只要並不是靠這來解决國政，布置戰爭，在朋友之間，說幾句幽默，彼此莞爾而笑，我看是無關大體的。就是革命專家，有時也要負手散步：理學先生總不免有兒女，在證明着他並非日日夜夜，道貎永遠的儼然。小品文大約在將來也還可以存在於文壇，只是以『閒適』爲主，却稍嫌不够。</p>
<p>人間世事，恨和尙往往就恨袈裟。幽默和小品的開初，人們何嘗有貳話。然而轟的一聲，天下無不幽默和小品，幽默那有這許多，於是幽默就是滑稽，滑稽就是說笑話，說笑話就是諷刺，諷刺就是漫駡。油腔滑調，幽默也：『天朗氣清』，小品也：看鄭板橋道情一遍，談幽默十天，買袁中郎尺牘半本，作小品一卷。有些人旣有以此起家之勢，勢必有想反此以名世之人，於是轟然一聲，天下又無不駡幽默和小品。其實，則趁隊起哄之士，今年也和去年一樣，數不在少的。</p>
<p>手拿黑漆皮燈籠，彼此都莫名其妙。總之，一個名詞歸化中國，不久就弄成一團糟。偉人，先前是算好稱呼的，現在則受之者已等於被駡；學者和敎授，前兩三年還是乾凈的名稱：自愛者聞文學家之稱而逃，今年已經開始了第一步。但是，世界上眞的没有實在的偉人，實在的學者和敎授，實在的文學家嗎？並不然。只有中國是例外。</p>
<p>假使有一個人，在路旁吐一口唾沫，自已蹲下去，看着，不久准可以圍滿一堆人；又假使又有一個人，無端大呌一聲，㧞步便跑，同時准可以大家都逃散。眞不知是『何所聞而來，何所見而去』，然而又心懷不滿，駡他的莫名其妙的對象曰『媽的』！但是，那吐唾沫和大呌一聲的人，歸根結蒂還是大人物。當然，沈着切實的人們是有的。不過偉人等等之名之尊視或鄙棄，大抵總只是做唾沫的替代品而已。</p>
<p>社會仗這添些熱鬧，是値得感謝的。但在鳥合之前想一想，在雲散之前也想一想，社會未必就冷靜了，可是還要像樣一點點。</p>
<h3>廬隱靈前</h3>
<p>— 朝義</p>
<p>女作家廬隱逝世了！知道了這個消息的，恐怕都不免嘆一口氣吧。</p>
<p>在她逝世第二天（十四日）的下午，是她大殮的時候。我懷着悲痛的情緒，走到中國殯儀館去。那裏的空氣也没痛得似在徵象她的不幸。她就在禮堂的正中，件着她的作品靜唾着！看了她灰白的臉孔，我依稀記起了她的『或人的悲哀裏』的幾名話：</p>
<p>『親愛的朋友ＫＹ：我的病是没有希望治好了！······</p>
<p>我在世界，</p>
<p>不過是太空的行雲！</p>
<p>一陣風便把我吹散，</p>
<p>還用得着思前想後嗎？』</p>
<p>這不啻是她的自輓詩。當然她自已並未早料到會死得這樣快，這樣慘。</p>
<p>她的友人劉大杰，舒新城等，報告她生平的歷吏和最近的生活之後，六點鐘敲過，就是她永别人間蓋棺定論的時候了！</p>
<p>曾有人批評過她的作品：個人主義色彩過重，感傷的分子過多。而且說她和冰心一樣停滯在五四的路上了！但至最近，她的『火焰』等在各雜誌發表後，有些人又歡喜地說：廬隱的作風改變了，從此或走上新的開展的路上去了！丨丨現在，我想正是可說話的時候了。</p>
<p>廬隱的作品究竟怎樣？正是我們的批評家捉筆的時候啊。我這樣沉吟着。帶着悲痛的情緒去，又帶着悲痛的情緒歸來！（五月十四夜）</p>
<h3>『春浮園日記』</h3>
<p>— 殊</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>於『賴古堂尺牘新鈔』中，得識蕭士瑋其人，讀他的娶妾怪論，所得到的印象殊不佳妙。於舊書肆目錄中，見士瑋全集目錄，日記竟佔二分之一以上，古人全集向無些例，亦頗覺有些怪。及購歸細讀，却感到他的日記，較之同時的明遺民，如葉天寥，歸莊諸家之作，究竟貧弱。此公在集中，和現在的海派文人一樣，自吹自捧，不止一回，但這不能提高他的文價。在我的理解上，一部『春浮園全集』，與其說是怎樣了不起的超特作品，還不如說祗是一部可贖之書，來得較爲切實，恰當。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>這襄祗想談談他的日記。蕭士瑋對於日記文學的估價，是極高的，錢牧齋序『春浮園别集』，說他『每言歐公『于役志』，放翁『入蜀記』，隨意揮洒，縱筆疾書，是天地間第一等好文字』。而他自已在『南歸日錄』的序裏，也說過余讀歐公『于役志』，陸放翁『入蜀記』，隨筆所到，如空中之雨，小大蕭散，出於自然』，這樣的文章，有一如空中雨點，蕭散可人，亦自閒靜者得之耳，逃雨者想未必以爲然也』。其對於日記文之愛好，以及了解，於此可以見之。一般的說來，把日記文作爲『天地間第一等好文字』看，未免誇大一點，但『如空中之雨，小大蕭洒，出於自然，』却說得非常中肯。對於過去諸家日記，他最推崇陸放翁，於日記本文中可以見之。『春浮園偶錄』庚午卷七月二十二云：『讀范石湖『吳船』，『驂鸞』諸錄，雖不能如放翁『入蜀記』之妙，然眞率之意猶存，故自可讀。惟近來諸遊紀，正蘇公所謂杜默之歌，如山東學究飲村酒，食瘴死牛肉，醉飽後所發者也。』同年，『五月十四，酷暑，不能窺園，跂足北牕，高臥而已。睡起讀放翁『入蜀記』。士瑋對於此書，可謂不憚百讀，其愛好之誠，眞是無以言之；至時人之作，他是充分表示不滿，『蕭蕭日記』（乙亥）中一樣的提到：『九月二十三，閱『快雪堂日記』，信筆點染，自有風範。他人多方矜愼，正如婢學夫人，舉止羞澀，終不天然，若口角稍沾吳音，便同俺門之娼耳』。他自已喜寫日記，甚至成爲全集主體，那是如他集中所說，是愛好，是和種植花草一般，『性分所至，復不能已』（庚午，『春浮園偶錄』）。其實，時人所作日記，事實上是不會像他所說的惡劣的，如李日華『味水軒日記，』袁中郎『塲屋後記』，也並不能說不是好文章，此殆士瑋之偏見耳。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>士瑋日記的主要特點，是田園詩人般的生活寫實，這在全日記之中，所佔的分量，大約總有五之三。他叙『春浮園偶錄』（庚午）所說：『三春爲藝花樹所忙，晝夜矻矻，苦不得休。以無益之事，而累有涯之生，自爲亦太少矣。然性分所至，復不能已。避暑蕭齋，豐於暇豫，濡筆研北，聊紀歲時，如農家晴雨曆也。』以及『深牧庵日涉錄』序記裏所說：『吾姑從吾所好耳』，都可說明他的日記内容的主要傾向。他的這種傾向的形成，固然有『所好』同時也有如次的原因：『文人才士，筆端舌端殺機最隱，招　最壽。余性剛决，遇事衝口便吐，如喉中絮核，咯咯難下，間爲强忍，每傷風動氣，時復發作，故錄中語或涉微刺，皆忍極而發作之候也。』在刀劍斧鉞之下，非大勇者衝决死生，仗義執言，走向士瑋這樣逃避的路，是必然的。猶有遺憾的是，在士瑋日記中，所謂『微剌』，也畢竟是很少。以視『甲行日注』（葉天寥）『看花日記』（歸莊）所反映的明遺民的苦難生活與悲憤的胸懷，相差眞是不可以道里計。榮歸二記，非明遺民不能作，也不能放諸他代，而士瑋日記，則在封建社會中，除時日的議别，是可以作爲任何時代的產物。葉歸二記，社會的意義是很强的，『春浮園日記』不過是平凡的個人生活記錄而已。它之所以不能成爲一部超特的書，這也就是理由的一種。</p>

<h3>歐靜麗Eugenie（二）</h3>
<p>— 白韋</p>
<p>嚴冬之夜，玄和歐靜麗從歌舞院回來，已經過了夜了。和平常一樣，到了寓所，在她房門口，他親了她的手背，在道了夜安，各自回到私室裏。</p>
<p>玄進房，脫了外套和圍巾，便去開衣櫃取睡服。忽然三個蘋果，映入他的眼裏。他立刻悄悄地又下樓去，敲歐靜麗的房門。</p>
<p>『誰在那裏？』歐靜麗低問。</p>
<p>『是我，歐靜麗。你已經上床了嗎？』</p>
<p>『不曾。可是我已換上睡服了。』</p>
<p>『快上樓來！我剛才不曾記得我們還有幾個蘋果，讓我們吃了再睡罷。』</p>
<p>『好，我就來，』歐靜麗答應了。玄便先回到自已房裏，把電燈放低了，條桌推到床邊。蘋果和小刀都預備好。自已洗凈了手。</p>
<p>不一會，歐靜麗敲門進來，她穿着一身黑絨的長睡袍，兩頰鮮紅得很，這還是第一次她深夜到玄的室裏來。</p>
<p>『他們都睡了，我眞怕驚醒了他們。』她微喘着說。</p>
<p>『不妨事的，玄迎着她，並肩在床沿坐下。玄對着條桌，很敏捷地削去蘋果的皮，一片送到歐靜麗口裏，一片送到自已口裏。兩人輪流吃着，談着。</p>
<p>『我不要了，你自已多吃些罷。』她說。條桌上已經只剩一個蘋果了。</p>
<p>『我也够了。』玄放下小刀，推開條桌，便去漱了口，洗凈了手，回來仍靠住歐靜麗坐下。</p>
<p>他把右手圈住她的頸項，左手攀着她的腰肢，四片紅唇凑在一起了。歐靜麗也下意識地摟抱着他。</p>
<p>『歐靜麗，你也許想像不到我是怎樣在狂戀着你！』</p>
<p>『眞的，自從我認識了你，你把我完全變換了！』她含情地答了。</p>
<p>時　響了一下。</p>
<p>『我要回房間裏去了。』歐靜麗說。</p>
<p>他貪圖着這片刻的歡娛，他唯恐歐靜麗要下樓去，他搜索一個使這快樂延長的方法。他的眼晴逼視着她的眼睛，她看出玄眸子内情愛的火花，她忙閉上她那雙美目，迴避着；自已也有些飄飄然起來。</p>
<p>『歐靜麗，你·····』</p>
<p>玄不曾說完全他的句子，歐靜麗像觸了强電似地，立刻擺脫了玄的摟抱，立起來，想向房門口逃去。只一霎那間，玄的右手從後面按住她的右肩。·····</p>
<p>『你對我應當這樣凶暴嗎？』歐靜麗幽抑地說。</p>
<p>『你應當原諒我罷！』</p>
<p>歐靜麗没有回答。</p>
<p>這樣，玄便一交跌在幸福裏！他到這時候，才意識到他二十四年的存在的價值，歐靜麗潤濕了他的生活；歐靜麗便是他整個的生命！他用千百種不同的方法，使她快樂，又從她的快樂裏，得到自已的滿足！這異國的春天，這奇瑋的巴黎，更把他歷史上這紅字的一頁，完美到可能的限度。</p>
<p>歐靜麗呢，她儘管享受着一種奇秘的歡悅，儘管同程度地愛戀這崇拜她的東方少年，但她不能像玄這樣狂！這勤奮的姑娘，却另有一個顧慮。</p>
<p>燈下，歐靜麗悄坐着沉思。</p>
<p>『歐靜麗，你想什麽？』</p>
<p>『親愛的，我想，我倆這樣生活下去，眞不得了！』她遲疑地說，注意玄的反應。</p>
<p>『不得了？目前的生活還不够我倆享受的，管甚麽將來的不得了！』玄是一個現在主義者。</p>
<p>能有另一種生活，比這更美滿些嗎？』</p>
<p>『親愛的，你太理想了。我倆是這樣發狂地愛着，把正經事都忘却了。你可曾想到：自從我倆認識以後，我的功課荒廢得怎樣了嗎？我的筆記，演講會演稿，參考書等等，簡直你缺得我自已都不知如何追補了！便是你，你也把全部時間都消磨在我身上了丨』</p>
<p>『我倆的時間，還有更好的利用方法嗎？』</p>
<p>『不是，我倆一定要想到實際方面。目前最迫切的問題，便是隔考期只兩個月了。我如果考試失敗，下學年我父親就會不許我再來巴黎的。你再愛我些，便又怎樣？』</p>
<p>『那麽，依你便樣？』玄不能駁倒她，却反問一句。『我倆已經是這樣發狂地愛着了！』『我想來想去，只有你搬到别處去住的一個方法。』她鄭重地說。</p>
<p>『原來你不愛我了？』</p>
<p>『恰恰相反，我比以前更要愛你些。你若不依從我，倒是你不愛我了！我要你搬到别處去住，不過是相當地减少你親近我的時間。在我考試以前，我想規定每星期一到星期五下午六時到七時，我温習鋼琴的時候，你來和我談話，一直到我晚餐前，你便離去。星期六下午到星期日下午這一天半，我完全讓你替我支配。此外的時間，你得讓我靜靜地讀書。你接受我這意思嗎？』</p>
<p>『這樣我習不慣的！』玄委屈地說。</p>
<p>『親愛的，你自已勉强自已一些罷！現在有兩條路，請你選擇：或者我倆繼續像現在這樣生活下去，我考試失敗，下學年我被留在國内讀書；或者目前我倆分居，有節制地享樂着，我發奮些，把兩張文馮都考得，下學年我重回巴黎，我倆再住在一起。你選擇罷！』</p>
<p>『你一定要重回巴黎的！』</p>
<p>『旣然如此，我還有一個方法。』</p>

<h3>紗花　賣氣依然籠罩標紗</h3>
<p>紗市續疲、形勢仍軟、據市塲傳言、本月份紗有二紗廠八千包交貨之說、同時賣方壓力仍重、故市盤不振但現紗生意較多、全日有一千一百包之成交、午後市價爲之帶穩、就大勢論之不脫盤旋之局、</p>
<h3>金鷄續見下挫</h3>
<p>標紗前市開盤、以美印棉市微、漲、但塲中買户甚少、近月跌七角至一元一角、遠跌三四角、午後聞現紗銷路尙暢、各月回上一二角、全日成交統計二萬五千八百包、查賣出椿記七百五十包、大豐四百五十包、惠康六百包、賡豐一千五百五十包、長豐八百包、恊生一千四百包、錦昌五百包、買進德記五百包、長餘九百包、通記八百五十包、明德七百包、同和四百五十包、義成五百包、一日問最高價及收盤價列下、</p>

<h3>標花多頭稍稍出籠</h3>
<p>棉市略疲、而海外棉市微漲、本埠有一部份多頭出籠、市盤乃跌、惟太户買方尙未吐出、軋空之念未絶、故五六月期頗緊、遠月稍鬆、據另一消息、日商多頭亦有了結之說云、</p>

<h3>兩日來標紗下降之主因</h3>
<p>本埠棉紗市價、前昨兩日轉趨下落、將其不振之原因、略述如下（一）華北一帶連日購辦甚旺、近來進胃已有飽滿之狀、兼之環境不良、倉庫中之籌碼物尙有三萬餘包、據商塲言、永安廠申新廠在五月份共有八千包交貨之說、故實銷略滯、投機商又活動抛賣、同時外商亦大量賣出、壓迫尙重、市盤乃激趨下跌、然花價適成反比例、日向高峯推進、廠方成本計算愈見困難、（二）棉花因陳花時代、各路來源凋敝、上海存貨單薄、外商吸收、而海外棉市雖平疲、然採算價尙較華棉爲高、來滬不通、難以調劑、於是紗花價格愈距愈遠、廠商又陷入悲境、茲將標紗花最近高低價錄下、</p>
<p>五月期標紗五月八日最高價一百七十三元四角又　　四月十八日最低價一百六十七元四角</p>
<p>五月期標花五月十五日最高價四十三元七角</p>
<p>又　　四月十日最低價四十元零七角</p>
<p>就以上情形測之、花貴紗賤之苦、愈趨愈艱、昨日五月期收盤價爲一百六十九元七角、比低價時僅漲二元五角、五月期花收盤價爲四十三元一角半、比低價時漲起二元四角半、所以廠商又有提議减工風說、紗業更入艱難之途也、但查在此二星期中、華南華北及各帮買去運輸出口約有二三萬包之巨、廠方存底已减輕不少、日商近來日紗布裝運印度日本亦有一萬多包、故日紗價格步步向上、平均較華紗高四五元、照此而論、本紗當不致於大落耳、再將昨日華紗日紗行情、抄列於後、</p>

<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、又呈良好之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥漲三四角左右、故開價時、人心已呈昂勢、後因内地帮及本街客户、以米價之步緊、買氣活躍、近期以交割關係、漲度尙祇一分另、遠期因外行買進、又提高二下左右、但實銷帮仍多觀望、故雖環境略旺、過漲亦甚吃力也、迨至下午開盤、已現弱象、傳天津現粉回落二下、津浦路及隴海路之陳麥、當然湧足、售價又廉、據津帮所傳、該地製粉成本、祇在一元七八角之間、申粉走銷不暢、對此當有關係、故以後開價、卽又步鬆、較上午回跌一二分不等、結果本月份至八月份較好二厘半、九月份反跌五厘、十朋份不動云、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>納妾制度之廢止</h3>
<p>— 雪菲</p>
<p>最近報載，立法院修訂中之新弄法，規定嚴禁納妾，違者以姦非論罪。不久這新刑法卽將公布。這倒是我國新弄法上的一個大改革。中國婦女界幾年來所爭持的納妾問題，至此才算有了一個相當的解决。</p>
<p>納妾本是一個極落後的制度，只有在封建社會中才能存在。中國現雖不就是資本主義社會，然也已脫離了封建的外殻了。納妾制度，在這社會中，早已不應該存在。而納妾制度的廢除，至今日才得實行。孫中山先生早在其手草建國大綱中規定男女一律平等（這是新弄法規定嚴禁納妾所根據的一點），而這使男女不平等的最重要的障碍，却在今日才得實行撤除。從這一點，我們也可知法律怎樣總落在時代之後了。</p>
<p>納妾不獨是侮辱女子，而且是摧殘女子。女子本應該是活潑潑地走到社會上來，同男子們一樣做一個從事社會活動的。而現在則被禁閉在富人的『金屋』中，被少數人作爲玩物。『妾』事實上是等於一只貓一只狗。社會上也等於没有她這樣一個人，因爲她從不與社會發生關係，不過是一個寄生着的人罷了。中國納妾的，至少在幾千萬人以上，這精細的計算起來，該是一筆怎樣重大的損失呵。</p>
<p>現在，納妾制度，總算由法律上的被廢除了。然而，女子們是否就能由此而得到解放，是否就能由此而成爲社會上的人，這倒多少還有問題。</p>
<p>第一，我們知道，納妾制度的所以壞，第一是在它的以女子爲玩物。然而以女子爲玩物的，却不一定在『妾』的名義下才能實行。事實上儘有許多女子，名義上不是妾，而實際上却等於妾，一樣被男子作玩物。這樣，假使這被男子作玩物的根本弱點仍不改除，雖是廢止了妾的名義，對於女子的前途，實際又有什麽好處呢？所以，我以爲目前雖是廢止了妾的名義，然婦女眞正平等的地位，却並不會因此而就容易的獲得。眞正的平等，眞正的婦女解放，還是要女子們自已去努力。否則，恐怕結果還是空的。</p>
<p>第二，妾的名義雖在法律上廢止了然法律的效力，是否就能眞的禁止一切人納妾。法律根本是爲有錢人而設的，有錢人儘可設法規避一切法律的拘束（事實上是如此）。在這樣情形下，怎樣使這法律無阻碍的應用於一切人呢？這也是一個應該考究的問題。</p>
<p>此外，納妾大槪以富人爲多，尤以達官貴人爲多，故廢除納妾，最要自應從達官貴人做起，然後及於一般人。其次，納妾以他種名義行使的，卽居納妾之實，而避納妾之名，對於這種人，應如何制裁，似乎也應有個規定。這些，雖不是這問題中重要關節，但也値得附帶討論到的罷。</p>
<h3>「色」和「食」</h3>
<p>— 何覺夫</p>
<p>「食色性也」。這二者都是人類生活所必需的條件。因爲是人類生活所必需的，所以經營關於這方面的買賣，是可以撈到一宗厚利的。</p>
<p>我們該記得，前幾年曾轟動一時的某博士的性史學說吧。那時，我正在鄕下唸書，但這風氣早已深入到鄕間去了：稍具有性的種動的靑年學子，差不多每人都要手持一册，以示時髦，甚且，在一向怕羞的閨女的案首或枕下，有時也會發現一本二本。在窮鄕辟壞的鄕下，其情形尙且如此，那在繁華會翠的大市鎭，當可臆測到的了。這書的感人力若此之大，暢銷若此之廣：那麽，作者的一筆大收入，自是意中事了。</p>
<p>但是，在我們『禮義之邦』的中國，男女間的Ｘ事，一向是被人家視爲猥　卑陋的，不但翻破經史子集找不到這些字樣，就稍懂事理者，也不屑談。在這樣一個國度裹，突然來了對於Ｘ的公開討論的提出，固然會被一班壓抑在『男女授受不親』的禮法下的靑年男女們所熱烈地歡迎：但，遭遇社會上『舊』的勢力的反對，也是難能幸免的。所以，其結果，不但弄到書籍被禁止，可憐我們的博士，也不得不棄甲而桃之夭夭了。</p>
<p>數年的時光，是在不知不覺間溜過去了。我們的博士，或許也深悟到，這路是在我們古舊的國度裹走不通的吧，所以，我們的博士，憑着博士的聰明，又索性不談這些，而轉來從人類的另一本性丨食丨着手了。</p>
<p>費了博士幾許的苦心著成的這一部『食經』，到底是在說個什麽，在未窺全豹之先，當不敢憑空臆測；不過，如果顧名思議是不會錯的話，當不外是像以往的性史一樣，存矯世人飲食的不得體和不合理吧？（在寥寥數百字的序言中，其所說的也不過如此。）這樣的一部書，對於人間世的損益怎樣，我管不了：但，食旣是人類生活所必需的，對於食的選擇和方法，當然是人人所欲聞的；並且，這又是一種百無禁忌的書，一筆大宗的收入　，是滿有希望的。</p>
<p>由『色』的研究，一轉就轉至『食』，這大槪也就是博士之所　成爲博士處吧！</p>
<h3>看『醫騐人體』後的一點感想</h3>
<p>— 光漢</p>
<p>這一部『醫騐人體』，開頭用圖畫來說明人體内里各部分的構造和功用，與男女交接後精是和卵珠結合的情形，以及十個月懷孕中胎兒成長的經過，繼着便實地將孕婦臨產時的狀態放映出來。生產有平產，亦有難產。平產是非常輕快的，一忽兒胎兒主落地了。難產便十分費事，須施行手術，有的只用接生的機械作帮助可以了，有的則非剖腹不能爲功。我們常時惟聽到女人生產是一件極困苦的事，而不知道究竟困苦到怎樣的地步。及今親眼一看，才曉得一個女子當臨盆的時候，平產都還不見得如何難堪，若不幸而逢難產，那困苦的情狀，有非言語所能形容，產婦的生命，可說是臨於生死的關頭。牠又指示我們孕婦產前對於健康上應留意的種種，和嬰孩墮地後所宜處置的妥善方法。</p>
<p>這是一張在產科醫院裏實地攝取的影片，内容含有科學和敎育的意味，是値得一看的。關於這一類的影片，在外國不算怎樣希罕，敎育當局常把牠當爲社會敎育的工具來宣傳，灌輸民衆以新的有益的知識。我們甚願望我國亦能時時看到這種片子，以輔助社會敎育之不足。</p>
<p>然而我國的確是個『特别國情』的國家，無論什麽外洋的事物一到我國，都會變改本質和作用。『社交公開』或『自由戀愛』，在歐美男女間行之極其自然，可是一搬入我國就糟了，輒被靑年人誤用作爲『吊膀』或『幽會』的藉口，一班道學先生且引爲攻訐的對象。『摩登』的含義本也是很有深意的，誰知聰明的中國人却會將牠解爲『時髦』以競相崇尙。就像這部『醫騐人體』的影畫、牠在外國是作爲社會敎育的工具宣傳的，但是一</p>

<p>輸進我國，却給影業家視爲『刮錢』的寳貝，用作吸引觀衆的性感片了。我們只要一讀該片大幅的廣告，說些什麽『無遮無掩』，『儘量的表露』，『澈底的公開』，『赤祼裸地讓觀衆欣賞』一類的肉麻誘惑的詞名，便不難明瞭其居心所在了。至若一般觀衆之趨之若鶩，花三毛大洋錢的代價去欣賞，除了極少數人以外，無非是抱着好奇的心理，想在性的神秘上獲得了暫時的刺激，作爲聊以解渴的慰藉，何嘗存有吸收生理常識的意思。影戲院裹的無數看客，一見到白布幔上展開着某一幕『精彩』的塲面，不是都發出了一種不堪入耳的怪聲，瘋狂地在呌囂着嗎？眞是一種怪現象呵！</p>
<p>近頃香艷肉感的影片，在中國社會確具着一種大力量，足以使觀衆們顚倒。上海各影戲院賣座最盛的片子不是『唐吉軻德』『金山』，而是『四十二號街』『華清春暖』。『健美的女性』和『回到自然』，更帶有無限的誘惑性。此外，銀幕中的人物，雖然會說話會行走，裸起體來也是異常迫眞的，頗能使人們的情緒緊張一時，但終究是死的東西，難以充分滿足觀客的慾望，比不及舞台上活的美人『乳峯顫抖』『肥臀擺動』的草裙舞，才是够人神迷魂蕩！現在本地大小影戲院於演映肉感片之外，不是又在盛行着各種裸體歌舞了嗎？這爲的是要適應社會的需求呀！</p>
<p>於是我明白這一部幾年前在北四川路一家日本電影院開映過，含有科學和敎育意義的『醫騐人體』，會在今日重見於上海社會之由來了。記得從前這張片子也是曾經轟動過一時里！</p>
<h3>幻夢</h3>
<p>— 道</p>
<p>更闌了，周遭靜寂得如同墓石一般，窗外似遠似近的樹葉隱約的地傳來。屋子裹就只有壁上的掛鐘，滴篤的作嚮，和着我的心絃打合奏成爲唯一的聲音了。在牀上，雖然閉了眼睛，但怎麽着也睡不了。眞是苦惱不過，於是許多念頭便悄悄地踏上腦袋來了。靜靜的聽着鐘擺一聲一聲跑了過去，神志開始漸漸恍惚起來。就在這時候，一個時常思念着的影像霍然地從眉角浮描出來了。整個的靈魂立卽沉浸在醇酒一般芳馥的迷離中，彷彿身子已走出了屋外。有月亮，夜是神秘的，無言地　在乳白色的月光懷裹。</p>
<p>女宿舍早被無邊的寂寞籠罩着了，淺绛紗的月色的蕩漾中，出現着一扇動人的影兒，上半個身體斜倚在木欄杆上，一手支着下腮，射着一隻伶俐的慧眼，凝視着碧空間的月兒出神。來了一陣徵風，吹動她一頭鳥絲的柔髮，輕輕地飄舞着。銀粉樣的月水灑在她的面龐上，越襯出一種　媚撩人的嬌態來。</p>
<p>一切都麻醉在緋紅的顫動中。</p>
<p>『花朶似的人，知不知顚倒了多少靑春的心魂，但是日月易逝，向東的流水是不會倒流的。别輕把年華辜負了吧。十五過了的月兒，問有什麽寒玉來補？』我目不轉晴地死釘着她。一面心裹懷着非常艷羨的自語自。</p>
<p>造化賦了她那麽美麗的嘴臉，把人間美飾得更有活氣了。而她的年紀還輕，也許不會將驕矜來誇飾她的靑春吧。因爲她的舉動都是十分天眞無邪。絲毫看不出傲慢冷冰的表情來。這未想着，於是便不自愧穢的懷着綺麗的幻想，甚於至白日之夢，每每一　着了她，立刻就感到了一種莫名的慰藉，濕美的情緒，這不安定的無寄托的心身，差不多日夜都飛越在她身上去了。到底怕只有落得一塲空虚吧。可是在這日靜風冷的深夜裹，却獨自出來在呆站着，究竟爲了什麽呢？這不是一個狠不容易碰着的接近的機緣，我鎭定了迷亂的神經。接着緩緩地走上去，本能的喊了出來：</p>
<p>丨丨下來吧，我懷念你多熱切啊，饒我的唐突吧。</p>
<p>說了後，虚心的梭巡周遭一下，</p>
<p>地盼待她的動靜，擔憂她給個不理，你猜她怎麽着，竟出乎意外地媚然將那晶亮的眼珠轉了過來。</p>
<p>遠遠地似乎還在微笑着，却没有作聲。</p>
<p>這一刹的感動眞是不少，如像在漫長的冬夜裹突然瞥見一縷光芒，昏黑的眼底馬上明朗了，遍身的筋骨有如觸着電流一樣感到說不出的　弱輕鬆。</p>
<p>過了半响，更興奮，勇氣亦加倍有勁，於是再：</p>
<p>丨丨親愛的，快下來，讓我告訴你一個完美的故事。</p>
<p>此時，隱隱地聽見從樓上一步一步走下來的輕盈的步武聲的我幾乎狂喜得跳了起來。然而隔不久。顯現在眼前却是可惡的舍監的臉龐，喀啾喀啾的口哨，傳進耳鼓裹，我心扉不禁怦怦地跳個不休。兩手急的揑了一把冷汗。</p>
<p>從　恍的朦朧裹驚醒過來的時候，揉了揉疲倦的眼皮睜滿屋子舖開來着慘黃的燈光。給死一般的沉默佔據着。我苦味的哭了出來。一個孤伶的瘦影馴服地伴臥在一塊，回味幾分鐘前的情景，好像縷縷的靑烟飄浮在茫茫的蒼空裹，說不出的悵惘，灌滿了荒蕪的心田。</p>

<p>編者共接程女士二信，第一信因無地址，未便答覆，十五日所登者乃第二信耳。今閱李君來函及附程女士致李君函，知彼等糾葛，已得合法解决，編者深爲程女士慶。至於標題『薄倖』二字者，則因編者之答覆，向以來函爲根據，是否事實，在所不問，照程女士來信，則加李君以『薄倖』，要非故意汚蔑也，茲將李君原函，一字不易，照登於後，編者因篇幅有限，未能附覆，容後當詳論之。編者識。</p>
<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>敝人李月如，今天得讀　貴報本埠新聞增刋業餘信箱欄，見到已經離婚掉的妻丨程雪珍女士的信札，和你李先生對該事件一意見：標題是『夫婿薄倖』。　　本來不敢有擾先生，但，報紙是大衆的讀物，在這裹顯然寫出了敝名還不算，先生又昭然標着『薄倖』字樣，能不吸引讀者的視綫嗎？敝人雖非聞人，很用不着『闢謠』『糾正』一套花式，可是人格和名譽，總是有關，所以，似乎未便緘默。况且表面上看來，好像是我個人的事而已，其實在現實社會中，有的是這些事，一幕一幕永也不斷的表現着呢，所以敢和先生討論一下，給我一個正確而明晣的批判。我固然可滿足了，同時社會上類似的痛苦者也可得一眞理的認識。</p>
<p>程女士原信所說的事實，雖大致無訛　，但，没有指出原因來，就很使人無從索解。第一時間上先有問題；大槪她那信是五月十一日前寄給貴刋的。須知：我倆恊議離婚，已於五月十一日很圓滿的簽過字，十二至十五的本埠各大報，都分别地登着啓事，也許一般人未曾注意及此。丨離婚的事實是如此：我們雙方同意，各請證人，同於十一日在律師處簽字離異：我把現有的現欵十分之七給她作瞻養費，她所有衣服飾物並部份傢具，統由她拿去，兩個小孩，則完全歸我鹽護撫育。我並允許她，若我將來發逹後，可能狀况之下，我還可再津貼她相當的費用。第二是錯誤的原因：論到這段婚姻，我自始就是被動的，從說合以至結婚，全由我父親作主，我那時根本不理解結婚與人生有多大的重要性！？對於後來的前途，委實一點憧憬也没有。結婚之後，我開始和社會接觸，在社會中奮鬭越久，經騐和學識也漸漸增加起來，人生也漸漸認識了，諙姻的基礎是什麽也明瞭了。於是，我知識日豐，我和她的情感却反比例地日淡。終於，雙方智識，志趣，興味，信仰，思想，··一切的一切，什麽都和級數一樣地相差太大，精神上愈離愈遠，完全使我們形成了兩個對立而矛盾的人生！請敎·在這種環境下會有愛情發生嗎？能有美滿的配偶嗎？至於產生兩個孩子，那是人類共有也是應有的本能的衝動結果，這在有識者看來，决不致認爲性交必有愛情吧！假使果眞認那爲愛的表現的話，我相信這個人就根本不了解愛情是什麽。</p>
<p>我打算離婚，是三年以前的思想，因爲自已没有經濟力量，所以一直隱忍着在渡那『名存實亡』的痛苦生活，不忍令她一個無自立力的女子，隨便去飄泊，雖然也於我片面的精神上是極端難堪。我到今天爲止，尙未和女人們交際過，嫖妓宿娼，更有些不敢嘗試，怎麽先生竟也隨意附和她片面之詞而武斷地說我『另有新人』呢？我們離婚之前的最近，她還說過：『你儘管納妾』的話，有什麽理由令我捨合理的離婚而取違法的討妾呢？在現社會間儘有納妾重婚的事實，且爲一般人習慣上認爲當然的趨勢，我何獨不可這樣呢？但，於她又有什麽好處？</p>
<p>我固然不能犧牲自已，長期挨這不合理的結合所賦予的苦痛；也不願毫無人道地令她守活寡，受那凄凉的活罪。</p>
<p>硬使兩個意志决對不相合的人成配偶，是罪惡，不是道德！我若敷衍維持以終，我就是不道德！也就是没人性的懦者。這些話說給封建思想浸透了的人們聽，當然是不通，給一知半解的人們看，或然不盡然；祇有說給豐富學識如先生的人聽，才能同情我，我解我。我明知以我們的情形，要求現社會制度下的法律承認我們有十足的理由離婚是不可能的！不過我推想法律不外人情，人情難道要矛盾不合理嗎？這等結合維持下去果是合理化嗎？我不得不請先生給我一個解答。</p>
<p>關於先生的意見，有幾個問題，值得答覆討論的是：（一）爲什麽你會感受到這樣不幸呢？這在新舊交替社會下，我們正是必然的犧牲者，因爲我們不是幸運兒。（二）爲什麽不能得到補救呢？夫婦結合的基礎建築在純正愛情上，没有愛的結合，是無法補救的！可以說是社會的錯誤，也可說咎在法律。（三）要怎樣纔能使這樣痛苦不再發生呢？這和第二問有相互關係，我敢說永遠不會斷絶！先生說：『祇有將來人人有職業的社會降臨了，就不會發生這等痛苦。』也許對的，那末什麽時候人人有職業的社會就降臨了？到那時果眞不會發生這些痛苦呢麽？關於這個問題，討論起來可以成一幾萬字的在著作，於今也不用多說。我想說的很多，恐非貴刋所允許，聊聊說了幾名，目的深怕一般人誤解。很有幾個月友因見貴乔而生誤會的，所以特請先生以同一態度也將我的信登載出來，免得以得再有更嚴重的糾紛！若因此影響到敝人的名譽和人格時，那可不是頑兒的。</p>

<h3>窮紳士（九）</h3>
<p>— 英國喬治吉星作孫浦譯</p>
<p>『請你，』他說，『給我一個新生下來的鷄蛋，和一個新鮮的小萬苣。』『今天晚上只是一個麽？』那個婦人說。</p>
<p>『謝謝你，只要一個，』他回答着，好像是在客室裹說話似的。『請你原諒我，假若我說要一個眞正新產生下來的鷄蛋。上一次，我想，一定是不經心地把蛋裝在箱裹了丨在事務忽忙的時候這是没有方法的事。』</p>
<p>『向來是一樣的，』那個肥店主說。『我們不會有那樣的錯誤。』</p>
<p>『啊，請原諒我！也許我想丨』</p>
<p>鷄蛋和咼苣小心地存在一個他拿來的手袋中，於是他回到家裹去了。一點鐘後，當他用完了晚餐，坐在直背的椅子上，沉思在黃昏裹，這時門上有了敲門聲，傳進來一封信。有信給丁巴利先生是異常稀少的事，以致當他檢看着信封，他的手顫抖着了。打開了信，第一件更小西他看到的便是一張小支票。這更使他興舊了；他焦灼地張開了信紙。信是威爾夫人寄來的，他這樣地寫着：丨　　『我的親愛的丁巴利先生，丨在我們昨晚的談話後，我禁不住地想着你以及你的美麗的自我犧牲的生活。我以那些窮人們的運命和我自已的運命對比了一下，這使我不能不覺到，我是過當地幸福，過甚地享樂着了。這種思想的結果，我覺到我必要給你的善良的工作送一些施金丨這是在歡快的休假的開始時一種祭祀。請你把這錢分發給你的兩三個最需要的扶助者，或者，你若覺着適當的話，全部給一個人也可以。我切切地希望我們能够在盧賽茵看到你。丨請你保重。』</p>
<p>支票是五鎊錢的。丁巴利在窗邊手拿着支票凝視着它。以他的現在的估價五鎊往彿是一個極六的數目。想一想一個人可以用它作多少事吧！他的靴子丨修理過兩次了丨已經不能再無破爛地穿好久了·他的褲子再稍久一些也就不能穿在人前了。他戴的帽子（曾是多麽細心地愛護着啊！）還是三年前來到倫敦時的那一頂。他守際上是急切地需要從頭到脚換一套新服裝了：在伊紫靈頓五鎊錢備辦你全部還是用不了的·到底什麽時候他能有這樣的數目自由使用呢？</p>
<p>他深沉地嘆息了，在昏暗中他凝視着周圍。</p>

<h3>The League of Nations, the United States, and Russia Form a Chain; the Advisory Committee Overtly Discusses the Issue of Pseudo-Postal Services, but Actually Negotiates a Far Eastern Cooperation Pact; the Soviet Union's Accession Becomes Increasingly Likely</h3>
<p>(Geneva) As the situation between Japan and Russia becomes increasingly tense, diplomatic efforts to encourage the Soviet Union to join the League of Nations are also intensifying. During the meeting of the Committee on Non-Recognition of "Manchukuo" on May 14th, the Soviet Union will be invited to join through diplomatic channels. French and other European diplomatic circles now believe that the Soviet Union's participation in the committee will facilitate its accession to the League of Nations during the General Assembly in September. Sources familiar with the League of Nations claim that the Soviet Union is currently considering joining the League to secure the support of the majority of member states in the event of a break with Japan. However, others believe that the Soviet Union may not formally join the League immediately, but may adopt the American approach of close cooperation with the League first. Overtly, the Committee on Non-Recognition of "Manchukuo" will discuss applying the principle of non-recognition to the issue of postal services. However, in reality, the committee will discuss the conclusion of a Far Eastern Cooperation Pact, enabling the Soviet Union and the United States to assist the League of Nations in implementing its policy of non-recognition. The League of Nations believes that this committee will serve as a link between the United States, the Soviet Union, and the League of Nations. Italian diplomatic circles support the reorganization of the League of Nations with the inclusion of the Soviet Union, believing that this is the only way to prevent a crisis in the Far East. France believes that the Soviet Union's accession to the League of Nations will ease the situation and provide France with greater security. The League of Nations believes that there are various possibilities for the Soviet Union to participate in the work of the Committee on Non-Recognition of "Manchukuo." According to the League of Nations, the letter of invitation to the Soviet Union to join the committee is still outstanding. In its reply, the Soviet Union accepted the basic principles of the Lytton Report and stated that although it is not a signatory to the Covenant of the League of Nations or the Nine-Power Treaty, it is a signatory to the Kellogg-Briand Pact.

<h3>French Newspapers Comment on the Far Eastern Question; China Can Certainly Rely on Its Own Strength for Construction; Japan's Opposition to Technical Cooperation Only Troubles Itself</h3>
<p>(Paris) "Le Journal" published an editorial commenting on the Far Eastern question, stating in brief: "According to the report of the League of Nations technical cooperation liaison officer Rajchman, the 1934 budget of the National Economic Council of China is only fifteen million, half of which is used for road construction (totaling six million eight hundred thousand). For a large country with a population of 400 million, the cost of construction in one year is only this amount, which is indeed insignificant. And yet Japan says that there are dangerous in China cooperating with international cooperation, is it not making trouble for itself? But one thing is very clear, that China can now rely on its own strength to seek construction. China does not lack talent, and its proposed construction plans are also very commendable. Unfortunately, many of the talented people in China are aloof and unwilling to participate in national affairs, which reduces China's power to save itself," etc. (Vass Telegram, 15th)</p>

<p>(Chongqing) Because the Nanshan was recovered by government troops, the Xu bandits had no choice but to open up another territory. It was discovered that the garrison in Wanyuan was weak, so they suddenly launched an attack on Wanyuan with a brigade. The garrison was weak and once abandoned the area. Large troops were then dispatched to suppress them, and it was recovered yesterday. (Central News Agency Telegram, 16th)</p>

<h3>International Aid to China</h3>
<p>— Britain</p>
<p>Since Japan issued its declaration on April 17th, its intention to control all of China's foreign relations has become very clear. Therefore, it will certainly fight with all its might against the Leith-Ross plan, which involves investment leadership in China. This is something recognized by both the Chinese people and the international community. Consider the Tokyo Rengo News Agency dispatch from yesterday: "Japanese Ambassador Ariyoshi is determined to leave Japan for Shanghai on the 23rd of this month. One of the important policies regarding China will be to vigorously promote Sino-Japanese economic relations, starting work in North China. The Yangtze and South China regions can also proceed simultaneously." This shows that what Japan seeks from China is absolute isolationism, and it is prepared to fight all countries for it. At this time, what kind of approach will be taken to resolve the future of international aid to and cooperation with China? The League of Nations Advisory Committee is currently meeting in Geneva. What effective steps will it take in response to the report by technical cooperation representative Leith-Ross, to make it a reality? What methods will Japan use to counter it? All are closely related to changes in this issue.</p>
<p>International aid to and cooperation with China, from the perspective of developing production, may seem to be above reproach. However, the nature of its implementation is distinctly different, and the results obtained may not necessarily be consistent. When a country undertakes production, the materials supplied by foreign countries, whether in cash or goods, may be obtained through exchange, "investment," or investment while simultaneously conducting large-scale direct capital imports. In a specific sense, all of the above methods can be called "international cooperation." However, the effect and result on the national economy are absolutely not the same. Based on this, the quantity of materials and the source of the suppliers cannot be regarded as the absolute prerequisite for the success or failure of a country's production plan. This is very obvious. Now, considering the situation in our country, whether foreign material assistance is an absolute prerequisite is a matter of debate. However, in our observation, the amount of materials and where they come from do not need to be scrutinized in detail. What should be studied is: 1) After foreign materials are imported into China, how will they develop normal effectiveness in implementing production plans? 2) Can guarantees for foreign materials imported into China be provided without offering actual "legitimate rights and interests?" 3) When assisting production in China, can foreign countries gradually reduce their plans for direct capital exports to China? All three of these are prerequisites for utilizing foreign materials and should be deeply studied. If these three cannot be resolved in a way that benefits the country, the so-called development of production plans cannot be regarded as a complete plan.</p>
<p>From the above, the central problem of our country's utilization of foreign materials does not lie in the source of supply. This is already very clear. However, the international community has experienced great turbulence due to this source issue. What Japan keeps in mind is that the League of Nations' unilateral actions violate its Monroe Doctrine, while China mostly advocates that cooperation with the League of Nations is necessary to break the plan for exclusive control. Which direction will be taken? It can only be determined by the development of events. What cannot be ignored now is what Japan's actual actions will be if the League of Nations resolutely implements the "non-recognition" policy. Observing the various news recently transmitted by Japan, it is known that Japan's active threat has the potential to tear up the Leith-Ross report with a single stroke. In this regard, can the League of Nations ignore Japan's power and proceed with the international material assistance plan without considering a plan for changing its approach? This is truly an issue that our people should pay attention to.</p>
<h3>Monk Government Committee Member Toktohuhu Arrives in Beijing, Visits Deputy Chairman Zhao of the Mongolian Council Yesterday, Bringing a Draft of the Autonomy Implementation Plan</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Monk government committee member Toktohuhu, accompanied by Wu Heling, went to the Mongolian Council on the 16th to visit Deputy Chairman Zhao, reporting everything. It was decided to visit President Zhu on the 17th and also to meet with He Yaozu of the Council. After staying in Beijing for two or three days, he will go to Gan to visit Chiang. Furthermore, Toktohuhu wore his official uniform, red hat button and feather when visiting Zhao, fully demonstrating the image of a prince. (Special dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Toktohuhu's staff member, Keladuer, said that Toktohuhu's mission is to report on the establishment of the Monk government committee, and to request the central government to allocate funds and to discuss matters related to the local Mongolian guard. Also, the Xilingol League borders Dong Province. Recently, Sun Dianying's routed troops and Yang Hou's small bandit troops have been causing disturbances in the Chahar east area. Although they have been reorganized by the Chahar provincial government, the local area is still not peaceful. Therefore, military defense in the Bailingmiao area is extremely important. Toktohuhu will discuss this matter with the central government. It is rumored that various tribes in Eastern Mongolia will establish an autonomous government, and there have also been rumors in Western Mongolia. Although it has not been realized, it is inevitable that there are attempts. It is rumored that the Japanese are active in various leagues and banners in Western Mongolia. Last winter, there was a plan to establish a radio station in the Xilingol League, but it was abandoned because of the severe Mongolian climate and the Japanese's unfamiliarity with living there. It is rumored that they will come to Mongolia again this spring, but there have been no actions seen at this time. (Special dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The 23rd year (1934) Mongolian Autonomy Implementation Plan drafted by the Monk government council, the Monk government council's budget estimate, and the organizational regulations of the council's various departments and offices have been brought to Beijing by Toktohuhu and others. They are scheduled to be submitted to the Mongolian Council on the 17th to be translated into Chinese, and then submitted to the central government for review. The implementation plan is divided into civil governance, security, finance, industry, and education. The financial estimates for the facilities and steps are divided into temporary and recurring expenses. The temporary expenses include the construction of official residences and facilities, totaling about 630,000 yuan. The recurring expenses are divided into administrative construction and other items, totaling about 78,000 yuan per month. (Special dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Toktohuhu, a member of the Mongolian Local Autonomy Government Committee, along with Section Chief Hookbageer and staff, arrived in Beijing on the night of the 15th. According to Hookbageer, they will stay in Beijing for about half a month. In addition to visiting Chairman Lin, President Wang, and various authorities on the afternoon of the 16th, they will also submit the council's 23rd year autonomy plan to the central government for review. It is not yet determined whether they will go to Gan to visit Chairman Chiang. The autonomy plan is divided into chapters on civil governance, finance, security, industry, and education. The estimated cost for the start-up expenses is about 670,000 yuan, and the recurring expenses are about 78,000 yuan per month. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Bao Songwen, a counselor of the Monk Government Committee, telegraphed to Beiping on the 16th, reporting that A, the chief of the Ih Zhao League, the deputy chief of the Sha Zhao League, and Na Sundelegeer, the representative of Kang Wang, had brought letters from the league chiefs and arrived at Bailingmiao to visit Yun Wang and De Wang, and presented their opinions on autonomy in person. They plan to go to the temple within the day to discuss the matter together. Also, the Monk Government Committee is now mobilizing Mongolian cavalry from various banners to form a guard team to consolidate public security. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 16th)</p>

<h3>Konoe Departs for America Today to Negotiate Far Eastern Issues, Expected to Stay in America for Two Months, Will Exchange Opinions with Hull and Others</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Duke Konoe Fumimaro, President of the House of Peers, is scheduled to depart for the United States on the Asama Maru, which will set sail from Yokohama at 3:00 PM tomorrow. He is expected to stay in the United States for two months. According to reports, his mission is as follows: This trip to the United States is to visit his youngest son at Princeton University, and to take the opportunity to meet with Secretary of State Hull and other dignitaries, and to exchange views on Far Eastern issues, and to fully explain Japan's position.

(Den-tsu dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Special envoys from Japan and America, Duke Konoe, are scheduled to depart for the United States on the Asama Maru from Yokohama at 3:00 PM on the 17th. Konoe is the President of the Japanese Upper House, and has been entrusted by Foreign Minister Hirota and the Zaibatsu to go to the United States as a lobbyist for Japanese-American friendship. Duke Konoe told Japanese reporters today that the purpose of his trip to the United States is not for Japanese-American friendship, but to visit his son who is studying in the United States. However, after arriving in the United States, he will meet with Secretary of State Hull to discuss China's policy and Far Eastern issues. In the United States, he plans to meet with 230 important figures from all walks of life in the United States to make the Americans understand Japan's policy toward China. He is determined to wear Japanese clothes and speak Japanese to show the spirit of the Japanese people. He is scheduled to return to Japan on August 24th. (Hualian dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<h3>Latham Leaves Japan to Return Home</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Latham and his party departed from Tokyo Station at 9:40 AM this morning. Many celebrities from Japan's political and business circles came to the station to see them off. The party plans to stay in Hakone Mountain for one night before heading to the Kansai area. (Nichiren dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Australian Foreign Minister Latham and his party are scheduled to leave Tokyo on the 16th to return home. His economic advisor, Woodhead, visited Ambassador Kurusu, director of the Bureau of Commerce, at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday. Regarding the content of the Hirota-Latham talks a few days ago, more detailed and specific opinions were exchanged. As a result, it was decided that after Latham returns home, the Japanese Consul General to Australia, Murai, will formally negotiate this issue. The content is divided into the following items: 1) Specific methods for adjusting Japanese-Australian trade; 2) Expanding the 1905 Japanese-Australian Commercial Agreement and newly drafting a Treaty of Commerce and Navigation that includes the most-favored-nation clause; 3) The issue of Japanese immigration to Australia; 4) The issue of Japanese-Australian wireless communication. (Nichiren dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Australian Deputy Prime Minister Latham made a radio broadcast last night, saying that Australia will recommend the appointment of a commercial counselor to be stationed permanently in Japan. His duties will be to develop trade between Australia and Japan, enhance understanding between the two countries, and prevent all misunderstandings. The people of Japan are very loyal to their country, and it can be understood that Australia's first duty is to be loyal to its people, and the second is to be loyal to the British Empire. Australia recognizes its relationship with East Asia, which will inevitably become more important in the future. This is why it is necessary to appoint a commercial counselor. Latham praised the beauty of the Japanese scenery, the strength of the nation, and the politeness of the government and the people. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<h3>Hirota Instructs Matsudaira to Oppose the British Boycott of Japanese Goods, Considering This Action a Great Regret, Hoping the British Government Will Ease or Abolish It</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already decided on a policy regarding the British implementation of the import quota system in its colonies. Foreign Minister Hirota has instructed Ambassador Matsudaira in the UK to ask the British government to pay attention to this matter. The content of the instruction is that the implementation of this system is a great regret, and it is hoped that the British government will ease or abolish it, as this system is contrary to the most-favored-nation clause stipulated in the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty, and it is feared that it will infringe on the close relationship between the UK and Japan. (Nichiren dispatch on the 17th) (London) Japanese Ambassador to the UK Matsudaira today asked the British government to amend its recent measures to deal with Japanese goods competing in the British market, saying that according to the Japanese government, the UK's implementation of this system is in conflict with the most-favored-nation treatment clause in the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty. (Reuters dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota has decided to immediately send a telegram to the British government to call the British side's attention and ask them to abandon the intention to implement the quota system. He telegraphed instructions to Ambassador Matsudaira in the UK last night. The content is as follows: 1) Regarding the Anglo-Japanese trade issue, Japan believes that there is a possibility of a satisfactory solution through negotiations between the two governments. However, the British side is not seeking sufficient means of discussion, and on the other hand, it intends to implement import quotas on Japanese cotton cloth and rayon fabrics in the UK and its directly governed colonies. Therefore, it cannot but be regarded as unfriendly. 2) The implementation of this system in the UK may be unavoidable, but if it is also intended to be implemented in the colonies, it violates the principle of free trade. Therefore, the world market should be regarded as a fair and free market except for the UK itself. 3) The implementation of the quota system in the UK and its directly governed colonies is suspected of violating the most-favored-nation condition in the Anglo-Japanese trade treaty. Therefore, the Empire reserves the right to express its intentions on this matter in the future. 4) Regarding the resolution of trade issues, it is hoped that negotiations between the Japanese and British governments can begin as soon as possible, and that the British government will submit concrete proposals.

<h3>Japanese Silk Falls Into Irreversible Decline</h3>
<p>Silk producers request an emergency appropriation of 100 million yuan, and send representatives to request the government to convene a special Diet session. (Tokyo) Japanese silk industry businessmen met at the Silk Club today to study measures to deal with the silk price. The silk market has been in irreversible decline since May. A week ago, it had already broken 500 yuan. Today's market price is also hovering between 519 yuan and 530 yuan. The silk industry is close to bankruptcy. After discussion, it was decided to send representatives to separately request the Prime Minister, the Minister of Agriculture, and the Minister of Finance to ask the government to allocate 100 million yuan to relieve the current plight, and to convene a special session of the Diet to resolve fundamental measures.

<h3>Pan-European Economic Conference Opens in Vienna, Representatives from Twenty-One Countries Attend, Germany Alone Does Not Participate</h3>
<p>The Vienna Pan-European Economic Conference opened today in the Austrian parliament building. Prime Minister Dollfuss, representatives from various Austrian government ministries, and the diplomatic corps stationed in Vienna all participated in the opening ceremony, so the general public believes that this conference is very important. More than 200 representatives from 21 European countries are participating, including 14 countries who are attending with the status of official observers. However, Germany did not send a representative to participate. (Havas dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<h3>American Silver Problem, White House Holds Meeting Again</h3>
<p>(Washington) The silver issue can be decided after President Roosevelt and the Senate silver faction meet at the White House tomorrow. Some well-informed sources here predict that the President will agree to a limited silver purchasing plan. The silver faction will go to the White House tomorrow to ask the President to decide his opinion. It is heard that the silver faction members have decided not to include the silver repayment of debt in the silver bill, as silver can be used to pay war debts, and there is no need to specifically mention it in the bill.

<h3>Germany Levies Exit Tax</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The exit tax levied by Germany has become more stringent today. A heavy tax is levied on those who leave the country permanently. Although the tax rate has not yet been specified, all those with 50,000 marks of capital or 20,000 marks of income will be affected by this new plan. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Message to Congress Approves 40 Million Yuan for New Ships, American Naval Combat Power is Very Strong, Already Proven in This Exercise</h3>
<p>(Washington) American Naval Operations Commander Sterling today reported the results of the exercise to the Commander-in-Chief of the American Fleet, Cyro, praising the combat power of the American fleet. The report stated, "The combat power of the American fleet is very strong and can be ready for combat at any time. Although fleet officers and men feel a lack, the fleet is sufficient to cope with it, and I am very honored." (National News dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt recently sent a message to Congress requesting approval for the government to use 1,322,000,000 yuan in new funding in the next fiscal year. The main allocations are as follows: 1) Federal government relief affairs and public works, 940,000,000 yuan; 2) Naval shipbuilding, 40,000,000 yuan; 3) Tennessee Valley Authority development funding, 48,000,000 yuan; 4) Pan-American aviation line, 5,000,000 yuan. The amount of public debt borne by the US government will therefore increase to 31,834,000,000 yuan. The President also issued a warning, saying that if Congress does not want to imbalance the 1936 budget or greatly increase taxes, the amount of 1,322,000,000 yuan cannot be arbitrarily increased.

<h3>Disarmament Situation Reaches Final Success or Failure Key Moment, Geneva Spreads Rumors of Indefinite Postponement of Disarmament Conference, But Henderson Issues Statement Denying It</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Important European politicians do not go to Geneva one after another, which shows that the Disarmament Conference is gradually not being paid attention to. For example, British Foreign Minister Simon excused himself that the cabinet had affairs and could not go far, and Foreign Minister Pinić, the rapporteur of the Disarmament Conference, did not come either. However, French Foreign Minister Barthou has arrived here and is now working behind the scenes, and will meet with British Lord Privy Seal Eden today. (National News dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) This afternoon, there was a widespread rumor here that the great powers had agreed to postpone the Disarmament Conference indefinitely. After investigation, it was found that this statement was indeed inaccurate. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(London) It is rumored that Henderson has resigned from his position as Chairman of the Disarmament Conference. Today, Henderson issued an article denying this statement, and said that he is currently engaged in preparations for the reopening of the Disarmament Conference on May 29. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The representatives of the great powers have today practically agreed to postpone the Disarmament Conference hosted by the League of Nations indefinitely, so the world is in danger of beginning an arms race. When the General Commission of the Disarmament Committee convenes on May 29, it will formally announce the failure of disarmament and transfer the disarmament issue to the League of Nations Administrative Council. However, this is just a routine procedure. According to political observers, the only hope is that this afternoon, the great powers agreed to request the Administrative Council to appoint a special committee to investigate the world's disarmament trends, so as to revive the Disarmament Conference if the situation improves. However, even this ray of hope is very slim. According to League of Nations sources, the Administrative Council will soon discuss the report of Henderson, Chairman of the Disarmament Conference. The report will list the reasons for the failure. After this report is accepted, the Administrative Council will appoint a special committee. It is heard that the committee will be composed of representatives from the United States, Japan, Russia, and the United Kingdom. The United States has always taken a bystander attitude towards European affairs, but if things go smoothly, the United States will also be happy to advocate it. It is said that this new development may be possible, because Mr. Henderson consulted with the representatives yesterday, and the results were good. Those who participated in yesterday's meeting included British Lord Privy Seal Eden, US Disarmament Observer Wilson, Italian Representative Aloisi, and French Foreign Minister Barthou. However, according to the opinion of the general public, they will not have any impact on the decision of the great powers to postpone the Disarmament Conference indefinitely. (National News dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<h3>Geneva, Busy Negotiating Disarmament</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Italian Representative to the League of Nations Administrative Council Aloisi consulted with British Representative Lord Privy Seal Eden and Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson this morning. The Italian government believes that the situation of the Disarmament Conference will soon improve, so it ordered Aloisi to contact Eden and Henderson. According to Italian sources, Germany's intended actions for the next Disarmament Conference seem to be gradually optimistic. (Havas dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) French Foreign Minister Barthou met today with Italian Representative Aloisi, Chairman of the Special Committee on the Saar issue of the League of Nations Council. The conversation was very sincere. The two talked about the various political issues of the Saar residents' vote in 1935. In other words, how to guarantee the freedom of the vote, the secrecy of the vote, and how to guarantee the safety of the residents after the voting results are announced. Barthou also explained the French government's views on disarmament to Aloisi, according to the original meaning of the document on April 17 this year (Reply to the United Kingdom). Barthou then had lunch with British Lord Privy Seal Eden. Barthou felt that Eden was sincere and could understand France's interests in the disarmament issue. Barthou then spoke by telephone with Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu, who is now in the capital of Yugoslavia. Titulescu said that Hungary had filed a complaint with the League of Nations Council regarding the border issue between Hungary and the South. The authorities of the Little Entente countries were satisfied with the attitude France took towards this matter yesterday. (Havas dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<h3>British Cabinet Subcommittee Discusses Air Force Draft Treaty, General Convention Difficult to Establish, Seeks Secondary Solution, Whether to Submit to General Committee is Still Doubtful</h3>
<p>(London) The British government intends to propose the signing of an Air Force Convention to limit the air forces of various countries when the general disarmament convention fails. This is a measure of last resort. The Cabinet Disarmament Issue Subcommittee met today to discuss this draft Air Force Convention. After the cabinet members studied this issue in detail, they believed that the reason why the general disarmament convention was difficult to establish was due to Germany's rearmament and France's unwillingness to recognize it. Now, taking a step back and only seeking to establish an Air Force Convention, this difficulty is not reduced at all. The British government originally planned to propose the Air Force Convention at the meeting of the General Commission of the Disarmament Conference on May 29. Judging from the current situation, it is still doubtful whether the British delegation will be able to submit this proposal at that time. However, the equality of the air forces of various countries is what has been advocated by Lord President Baldwin recently. At present, only this point is being paid attention to by British public opinion. (Havas News Agency dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister MacDonald will not attend the Disarmament Conference, contrary to recent rumors. Liberal MP Mandar in the House of Commons asked the Prime Minister the following questions: "In the current situation of the Disarmament Conference, does the Prime Minister believe that the greatest effort is indispensable, such as the Prime Minister's personal attendance? Secondly, is the British government still not in agreement on the policy to be adopted internally for disarmament? I dare to respectfully ask the Prime Minister." MacDonald did not answer this question. (Havas dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<h3>United States' Emphasis, Davis Will Go to Geneva Again, Attending as Observer</h3>
<p>(New York) American Chief Representative to the Disarmament Conference Davis decided to go to Geneva after meeting with President Roosevelt today to attend the meeting of the General Commission of the Disarmament Conference on the 29th of this month as an observer. Responsible parties believe that as long as the hope of establishing a disarmament convention has not been cut off, President Roosevelt cannot ignore the Disarmament Conference for a single day. This can be seen from Davis's upcoming trip to Geneva. (Havas dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<h3>French Foreign Ministry Schedules End of Week to Publish Yellow Paper, Disclosing Disarmament Negotiation Process</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is scheduled to publish a Yellow Paper at the end of the week, disclosing most of the documents regarding the disarmament issue, such as the diplomatic notes between France and Germany and between the United Kingdom and France, as well as the various conversations.

<h3>British Labor Representatives Petition the Government: League of Nations is the Only Organ for Peace; The U.S. and Russia Should be Invited to Cooperate</h3>
<p>(London) A delegation from the National Joint Council of the British Labour Movement called on Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Simon today to present a resolution on disarmament and the League of Nations. The delegation requested that the government take all possible steps to bring Russia and the United States into closer contact with the League of Nations based on the Paris Pact (i.e., the Kellogg Pact renouncing war as an instrument of national policy), and that the government exert its utmost efforts to ensure the success of the Disarmament Conference. The resolution expressed the opinion that the accession of Soviet Russia to the League of Nations would consolidate the foundation of peace and that the British government should invite Soviet Russia to join the League of Nations. The delegation also stated that, although the League of Nations is not perfect, it is in practice the only instrument for maintaining peace and stability. The Prime Minister replied that the government had made every effort in the past two years to establish a disarmament convention, but had not yet obtained agreement on its practical plans. Without agreement, there is no progress. The current status of the Disarmament Conference is a source of great disappointment to him, but the government will continue to strive for international peace at all times. Foreign Secretary Simon replied that the government had taken every opportunity to seek close contact and cooperation between Britain and the United States, but it should not be forgotten that the United States is in a special political and constitutional position. Simon also said that anyone wishing to join the League of Nations always requests membership on their own initiative. If Soviet Russia makes such a request, the British government will certainly welcome it. (Reuter dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Saar and Gran Chaco Issues in the League of Nations Council: Saar Special Committee Submits Report; Britain and France to Issue Declaration on Bolivia-Paraguay Affair</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Council of the League of Nations did not meet today, but held a closed-door meeting in the afternoon. The Saar Committee also discussed the political part of its report in the afternoon. It is reported that British representative Eden intends to persuade the member states of the League of Nations to ban the export of arms to the Gran Chaco, so as to prevent the prolongation of the war. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The current session of the Council of the League of Nations is paying close attention to the Saar issue. French policy focuses on ensuring adequate safeguards after the Saar residents' self-determination, such as the establishment of an international committee or the promotion of an arbitration court, so that the Saar cannot be immediately and completely annexed to Germany. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<h3>Saar Special Committee Submits Interim Report: Plebiscite Date Not Specified; Advocates Establishing Arbitration Tribunal to Resolve Disputes; Voting Results Should be Calculated by District</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The interim report submitted by the Special Committee on the Saar question dispatched by the League of Nations does not specify the date on which the plebiscite should be held to resolve the future of the Saar, nor does it mention the issue of guarding the ballot during the vote. The report proposes that the plebiscite should be supervised by a committee composed of commissioners from three neutral countries, and that an arbitration tribunal should be organized by two neutral countries to resolve all disputes. The expenses incurred in the plebiscite should be borne by the country to which the Saar belongs. If the result of the vote is to maintain the status quo, the expenses should be paid by the Saar itself. Furthermore, the result of the vote should be calculated by district, which is most opposed by Germany. (Reuter dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Special Committee established by the League of Nations to prepare for the Saar plebiscite expressed the opinion in an interim report that when the Saar holds a plebiscite in 1935, the administration of the region should remain the responsibility of the Governing Commission appointed by the League of Nations in accordance with the Treaty of Versailles, but that a "Voting Tribunal" must be established to hear various cases related to the vote, and that Saar judges and French judges should not participate. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Saar Judicial Administration Influenced by Hitlerism: Governing Commission Quarterly Report Published</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The 57th quarterly report (reported every three months) of the League of Nations Governing Commission for the Saar region was published by the League of Nations tonight. The report states that the 1934 budget deficit of 33 million francs will be covered by an appropriation from the surplus of 82 million francs from previous years. The French member of the Governing Commission added an opinion in the report, specifically criticizing the judicial issues in the Saar region, stating that in the past year, some residents have doubted the fairness and integrity of the local courts. This concern is very justified, because the judges in the Saar used to base their judgments on the legal concepts of European countries, but now they are influenced by Hitlerism, viewing the German nation as the source of all laws. In the report, the French member recounted the various sufferings of the Saar people and the French due to court judgments, and then stated that in order to remedy this defect, it is necessary to create a neutral court to hear all matters related to politics. Other members of the Governing Commission have slightly different views. They believe that some judges in the Saar region are sometimes indeed unfair, and the situation is serious, but the proposal to create a special court cannot be considered, because according to the treaty, the Saar cannot establish a special court. However, the Governing Commission believes that during the period of the plebiscite in 1935, it seems appropriate to establish a court to hear all felonies and misdemeanors related to the vote.

<h3>Britain and France to Issue Declaration to Eliminate Bolivia-Paraguay War</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations expects today that Britain and France will issue an important declaration regarding the Gran Chaco War between Bolivia and Paraguay in South America when the Council convenes on Thursday. In 1932, Britain and France advocated banning the sale of arms to these two countries, but other European countries did not agree, so this proposal could not be realized. The recent report of the League of Nations Committee stated that if other countries stop supplying arms, the Bolivia-Paraguay war can be stopped. The important declaration of Britain and France is probably issued for this reason. It is widely believed that if the initiative of Britain and France receives the spiritual support of the United States, it should have a chance of success. (Reuter dispatch, 15th)</p>

<h3>German-Polish Friendship: Close in Commerce and Culture, Land Issues Still in Dispute</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The new understanding between Germany and Poland will also affect the commerce and culture of the two countries. The cessation of trade war between the two countries should lead to increased commercial development. In 1933, the trade between Germany and Poland was the lowest among European countries, averaging about 56 million marks. The new agreement still does not cite the most-favored-nation clause, but has removed various discriminations. The two countries no longer erect tariff barriers. Poland no longer resists the import of German goods, and Germany no longer prohibits the passage of Polish livestock through German territory. The transportation agreement between the two countries is still under negotiation, and its purpose is to complete the merger of the shipping industries of Bremen and Hamburg, and Danzig and Gdynia. The revival of German-Polish trade is beneficial to the commerce of eastern Germany. The textile industry and machinery industry of Germany and the agriculture, coal, iron, and mining industries of Poland will all benefit. In terms of culture, the newspapers of the two countries no longer attack each other. A famous weekly in Hamburg has issued special publications for Poland twice, which is a novelty among right-wing newspapers. The cultural exchanges between Germany and Poland are not very close. German science and literature are indeed admired by the Polish people, but the average German has no deep or incisive understanding of Polish cultural life. The political differences between the two countries have aroused scientific reactions, because historians in the two countries are constantly arguing about the land of the two countries.

<h3>Taking Advantage of the Victory, Hejaz Imposes Harsh Conditions: Demands Cession of Territory, Compensation for Military Expenses; Yemen Has No Choice But to Accept</h3>
<p>Cairo: If the Imam of Yemen accepts the peace terms of Ibn Saud, the territory of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will be greatly expanded. After the two armies ceased fighting three days ago, they are still in place, and the front is silent. However, according to reliable sources received here today, Ibn Saud's demands are very extravagant, attempting to win in negotiations what his army could not win on the battlefield. His first condition is that the Imam of Yemen cede the two areas of Tihamah on the Arabian Red Sea coast and Najran on the border. The military expenses of Ibn Saud's expedition must be compensated by Yemen. Other conditions include that the Imam of Yemen must guarantee the safety of officers and soldiers who have deserted to Ibn Saud's army. After the two countries demarcate the new border, the Imam of Yemen must not build defensive works on the border within 20 years. This article is very destructive to the Imam's power. Several qualified observers here believe that if it is implemented, Yemen will become a part of the Saudi Arabian kingdom within 20 years. It is widely believed that the Imam has no choice but to accept the conditions, but the Crown Prince of Yemen wants to fight to the end, but he is afraid that he will not be able to do so.

<h3>Zhu Jingzhou Discusses the Finances of Gansu Province</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhu Jingzhou said on the 16th that Gansu Province is facing financial difficulties, with accumulated debts of no less than 10 million yuan. After he took over as Director of Finance, he actively reorganized, compiled a budget, cleared up accumulated cases, implemented the change of garrison to civilians, reorganized surcharges and deed taxes, planned to establish a farmers' bank, and publicized the ticket price plan, cancelled the appropriation system, reorganized land taxes, reformed the bookkeeping system, and planned to levy business taxes. However, since Sun Jun's disobedience and entry into Qinghai Province, temporary expenses have amounted to more than 300,000 yuan. The post-disaster recovery requires even more funds, which the province cannot afford. The military expenditure of the province in 1934 was more than 6.5 million yuan, of which the number of guest troops accounted for 3.6 million, and the central government should be requested to directly distribute the funds. At the same time, all national tax agencies in Gansu Province should also be taken over by personnel sent by the central government to seek unity. Zhu also talked about the finance and currency of Lanzhou, saying that Lanzhou used to have banks such as the Northwest Agricultural and Industrial Bank and the China Bank, but they successively closed down due to the excessive issuance of banknotes and the influence of the situation, and the people suffered great losses. The credibility of banknotes has been swept away, and general transactions are conducted using coins. Remittances, deposits and loans are handled by money shops and banks. There are also 13 pawnshops in Lanzhou City, with interest rates of more than 30 percent, and some in the interior reaching as high as 60 percent, but there is nowhere to cash them, which shows that the social and economic situation is depleted. It is hoped that the central government will set up large-scale financial institutions in Gansu to facilitate adjustments, etc. (Central News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>

At the same time, the first and second five-year plans for the development of heavy industry are being implemented, and their policy towards Japan and the puppets is gradually changing. Moreover, incidents such as the Yilan People's Army's resistance against Japan in the past had Soviet Russian backing. In addition to fear, the Japanese puppet authorities are now urgently planning countermeasures. Harbin Dispatch: The Volunteer Army that failed to resist Japan last winter and fled into Russian territory has gradually sneaked back into the puppet state during the ice-thawing period this year, dividing into small detachments, entrenched in various places, and supporting each other, appearing to have a very large plan. This is very different from the Volunteer Army of the past. Its political and ideological color is extremely strong, and it is carrying out anti-puppet and anti-Japanese propaganda among the Korean and Northeast people, with several Russians participating. According to secret information, this is the vanguard detachment of Soviet Russia (Northeast Agency)</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle of Righteous Army Against Japan in Rehe-Liaoning; Over a Thousand Japanese Soldiers Killed or Wounded; Liaoning Righteous Army Fights Bloodily for Three Days and Nights</h3>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: According to people from Rehe, the largest base of the Volunteer Army in Rehe Province for the past two years is the area around Wujiazi, Sanjiazi, and Weijiagou. Since the 4th of this month, it has been besieged by more than 6,000 Japanese troops under Akiyama, Kuwabara, and others, with fierce bombing by artillery and aircraft for three days and nights. The Righteous Army units under Liu Zhendong, Li Shuzhen, and Li Sheng fought desperately. As a result, over a thousand Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded. Wujiazi was captured by the Japanese army, which set fire to the village, killing hundreds of innocent farmers. It is truly the most tragic sacrifice in Rehe Province. Currently, there are still more than 3,000 people defending the mountains. Because the Koga regiment was wiped out in this area in the past, the Japanese army hates this area extremely. They kill everyone they encounter in every village they capture, which is extremely cruel.</p>
<p>The units under Liu Yisan, the Deputy Commander of the Liaoning National Salvation Army Qi Zhanyuan, Wang Huimin, the commander of the First Brigade, and Chen Guofan, the commander of the Second Brigade, have all concentrated on the Xichangshanyu and Baishishan areas of Fengcheng County as their bases. This place is militarily advantageous, suitable for both defense and offense. They plan to launch a large-scale attack when the green gauze curtains rise. It is learned that since the uprising, this unit has had more than 50,000 soldiers, fighting for three years without a day of not engaging the Japanese puppet army under the smoke of gunpowder. Those who remain are all veterans accustomed to battle and can be called elite troops. The Japanese puppets fear them especially. Therefore, the puppet army under Yu Zhishan, with two infantry regiments and one mountain artillery company from Fengtian, the puppet army under Wang Dianzhong, with more than a thousand infantrymen from Yingkou, and the 3rd Company of the puppet Public Security Brigade of Haicheng County, totaling more than 5,000 men, advanced in three routes: the left route from the east of Liaoyang County, the right route from the south of Haicheng County, and the middle route through the front of Qian Mountain. The unit waited at ease, dividing its forces to respond to the enemy, and fought bloodily for three days and nights. The outcome was undecided. Unexpectedly, the Japanese army sent the Goda Battalion and one medium-sized field artillery company from the Anfeng Road. The Japanese puppet coalition launched a general attack at the same time. The Righteous Army finally ran out of ammunition and had to break through to the east. The Japanese puppet army did not dare to pursue. In this battle, more than 300 soldiers of the unit were killed, and the Japanese puppet army also suffered heavy casualties, the number of which is unknown. The Righteous Army is currently reorganizing in preparation for a desperate battle with the Japanese puppets, but there is a shortage of ammunition and supplies. It is hoped that the people of the country can provide assistance, otherwise, once the ammunition runs out and there is no support, they may eventually be annihilated under the iron hooves and artillery fire of the Japanese army.</p>
<h3>Theft of Treasures from the Palace Museum; Ma Heng Advocates Strict Investigation; Stolen Jewelry Worth Over One Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Beiping Dispatch: After Ma Heng formally took over as the director of the Palace Museum, there will be reforms to the museum's affairs. The following is a record of the situation:</p>
<h3>Treasure Theft Problem</h3>
<p>The antiquities theft and replacement case has been investigated by the court, which dispatched personnel to identify the material evidence. In addition to the stolen and replaced jewels embedded in the court hat, phoenix coronet, and casual hat, there are also many pearl and jade ornaments, jade pearl Buddha crowns, gold hairpins inlaid with jewels, helmets inlaid with jewels, Qingliang crowns inlaid with jewels, and pearl-studded Qitou, etc. Among them, some pearl and jade ornaments are inlaid with more than 100 pearls per top, and many pearl-stringed double-dragon playing with large pearl hat strips. The jewels embedded on them have also disappeared. In addition, several strings of pearl court beads, such as those of the Shunzhi and Qianlong emperors, about half a box of large and small pearls, and several bags of jewels were all stolen and replaced. According to archaeologists, the value is estimated to be over one million yuan. Ma Heng, the director of the Palace Museum, advocated strict investigation, otherwise, it would be impossible to sort out the antiquities. As for whether such a large number of valuable antiquities were stolen due to improper storage in Shanghai, or due to inadequate transportation of antiquities to the south, further detailed investigation is needed.</p>
<h3>Display of Antiquities</h3>
<p>The southern transport of antiquities from the Palace Museum was originally intended to first establish a warehouse in Nanjing, move the antiquities stored in Shanghai that were related to historical documents, and then build a Nanjing branch to transport the majority of the antiquities stored in Shanghai for display. However, it is not easy to make this a reality for two reasons: 1) It is not easy to find a suitable site for the museum in Nanjing; 2) There are no funds to build a branch. Therefore, the previous board of directors did not discuss this issue. After the southern relocation of antiquities from the Beiping Palace Museum, the central route was opened first, followed by the western route, and now the eastern route is also open. The opening days for the central route are every Thursday and Sunday, the western route is every Monday and Friday, and the eastern route is every Wednesday and Saturday. Closed on Tuesdays.</p>
<h3>Candidates for Curator</h3>
<p>After the reorganization of the Palace Museum, a General Affairs Office will be established, along with three departments: Antiquities, Books, and Documents. Wang Shiduo is the head of the General Affairs Office, under which there are three sections: Documents, General Affairs, and Accounting. Jiang Han remains the curator of the Library, with Yuan Tongli as the deputy curator. The curator of the Antiquities Department was originally the former director Yi Peiji. Yi has resigned. It is still undecided whether the current director Ma Heng will concurrently hold the position. Zhang Ji was originally the curator of the Documents Department, with Shen Jianshi as the deputy curator. Zhang has been hired as a director, and according to regulations, directors cannot also serve as curators. Shen has the highest support for the position of curator of the Documents Department.</p>
<h3>Ma Heng's Remarks</h3>
<p>According to Ma Heng, the director of the Palace Museum, he resigned from the Executive Yuan two months ago. At that time, opinions from all walks of life regarding his actions were mixed. Those who understood said that the Palace Museum has heavy responsibilities and complex affairs, and resigning is a way to yield to more capable individuals. Those who did not understand believed that the Palace Museum is an important cultural institution and cannot be left without someone in charge. In short, the motivations of both groups stemmed from their love for the Palace Museum. Director Wang (Jingwei) urged him to retract his resignation and reluctantly accept the difficult task, with the board of directors assisting in resolving the difficulties. Therefore, he retracted his resignation and temporarily resumed his duties, while hoping that Director Wang would find another candidate for director, etc.</p>
<h3>Changes in Staff</h3>
<p>According to the new organization of the Palace Museum, there are eight to eleven recommended section chiefs and eighteen to thirty-six commissioned staff members. Currently, more than ten additional commissioned staff members should be added. The new organization stipulates sixteen to thirty-six clerks. There are currently many clerks and more than ten should be dismissed. Director Ma Heng did not dismiss staff members before because he was acting in an interim capacity. Now that he has formally taken over, he will soon make changes to some staff members. Moreover, because most of the staff members of the Palace Museum are fellow Hunanese from the former director Yi Peiji, the so-called Hunan faction, Ma has found it extremely difficult to deal with the Hunan faction staff members after taking over (15th).</p>
<h3>Feng Yuxiang Passes Through Jinan to Visit Penglai; Many People Welcomed Him at the Station; Visited the Rural Construction Institute in Zouping</h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Feng Yuxiang, a member of the Central Committee, has been living in seclusion in Mount Tai, studying behind closed doors and not asking about politics, for more than half a year. A few days ago, Han Fuju, the Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, visited Mount Tai when he was overseeing the suppression of Liu Guitang and paid a visit to Feng. They talked about the scenic beauty of Penglai Pavilion in eastern Shandong. Feng was very fascinated and declared that he would like to visit it when he had the opportunity. Recently, Feng decided to fulfill this long-cherished wish and telegraphed Han a few days ago to request the loan of vehicles for sightseeing. Han immediately arranged for his personal special car and several freight and flat cars to be combined into a special train for Feng's use. The train departed south at 11:00 p.m. last night for Feng's use. The reporter followed the train and recorded the details as follows:</p>
<h3>Photograph of Han Fuju (Right) Welcoming Feng Yuxiang (Middle) at Jinan Station</h3>
<p>The special train arrived in Tai'an before dawn. At about 5:00 a.m., Feng walked down the mountain, wearing a light blue coarse cloth lined jacket and trousers, blue cloth shoes, and a hexagonal straw hat, with a white cloth covering the lining. Under the guard of guards, he walked towards the station and boarded the special train. He then ordered someone to buy dozens of fried dough sticks to fill his hunger. Zhou Baihuang, the magistrate of Tai'an County, arrived at the station to see him off and boarded the train to pay his respects to Feng. Feng gave some instructions. At 6:45 a.m., all of the accompanying personnel and luggage had boarded the train, and it departed north. The reporter chatted with Feng in the car to relieve the loneliness of the journey. The reporter asked, "Mr. Feng, what is the purpose of your coming down the mountain this time?" Feng replied, "I have long admired the beauty of Penglai Pavilion, and I recently heard Chairman Han talk about its beauty, so I am taking advantage of my leisure time to visit it." "Will there be any stops in Jinan?" he was asked. "Not sure," he replied. "If there is anything worth seeing, I will get off the train to take a look. Otherwise, I may visit it on the way back. I have already seen the famous scenic spots in Jinan, such as Thousand Buddha Mountain, Daming Lake, and Baotu Spring." "In addition to Thousand Buddha Mountain and Daming Lake, the Longdong and Foyu areas, 30 miles northeast of the city, are extremely secluded and have cliffs thousands of feet high, surpassing other scenic spots in Jinan. I wonder if Mr. will only go to Penglai, or if he plans to visit other places as well?" he was asked. "It has not been determined yet," he replied. "If time permits, I may go to Longkou, Yantai, and other seaports." "How many days do you plan to spend on this trip?" he was asked. "I plan to return to Mount Tai in twelve days, but if that is not enough, I may extend it by one or two days," he replied. The reporter then asked Feng about his life in the mountains. He said that he was quite busy reading every day, and he regularly had seven teachers who taught him, such as Zhao Chengzhi, Xu Mosheng, Song Duanju, Chen Dingmin, etc., each of whom was responsible for one subject: 1) Chinese Economy, 2) World Economy, 3) Chinese Politics, 4) World Politics, 5) Vernacular Chinese, 6) Japanese, and 7) English. These are the seven subjects he studies every day. If he wants to study a certain specialized subject, he will hire an expert to teach it. Regarding his daily life, he said that he gets up at 4:30 a.m. every day, exercises (sword dance and boxing), practices calligraphy, writes in his diary at 6:00 a.m., studies politics and economics from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m., reads Japanese from 10:40 a.m. to 11:20 a.m., reads ancient classics from 2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m., and studies on his own or practices boxing from 7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Meal times are 7:00 a.m. for breakfast, 12:00 p.m. for lunch, and 6:00 p.m. for dinner, etc. Feng previously built a Martyrs' Shrine on Mount Tai. There used to be many plum blossoms in front of the shrine, no less than several thousand trees, but unfortunately, no one took care of them, so the famous flowers were buried and no one knew about them. Feng specifically reorganized the area and named it "Plum Blossom Port," comparing it to Lonely Mountain's Fragrant Snow Sea. He personally wrote a huge plaque, carved it on a stone, so that it could be juxtaposed with the famous mountain and become immortal. It is heard that construction will begin within the next few days. Feng also often writes calligraphy and couplets in the mountains to pass the time. A recent couplet he wrote was "Those who do not resist are inferior, reclaiming lost territory is superior." Feng currently has long hair, which is half gray. His back is also slightly hunched, but his spirit is strong, and he speaks with humor. His perseverance and endurance can be seen at a glance. Those who accompanied Feng on this trip included Qiu Bin, the chief of staff who resisted Japan in Zhangjiakou, old friends Zhang Fengbo, Wu Guyue, Chen Jinan, Chen Dingmin, Wei Huanan, pistol squad leader Wang Zhiyi, message squad leader Liu Peijiu, etc. In addition, he brought about 120 guards, and more than 100 people remained in Mount Tai. Feng's wife, Li Dequan, and his young children have already transferred from Qingdao to Beiping, but his eldest son, Feng Hongguo, accompanied him.</p>
<p>The special train arrived in Jinan at 9:00 a.m. Jinan had already received the news. Han Fuju, the Chairman of the Provincial Government, the chiefs of various departments of the headquarters, adjutant general Lei Taiping, Civil Affairs Director Li Shuchun, Finance Director Wang Xiangrong, Education Director He Siyuan, Provincial Government Member Zhang Weicun, Niu Zhao, Director of the Postal Bureau Liu Xizhong, President of the High Court Wu Zhenzan, Jinan Mayor Wen Chenglie, Public Security Director Wang Kairu, and other military and political figures such as Zheng Jicheng, all arrived at the station to welcome him. After the special train entered the station, Feng got off the train, shook hands with everyone who welcomed him, and repeatedly said, "I am just taking a small trip to Penglai and have nothing to do. Everyone has work to do, and I am not worthy of your welcome. Thank you." Feng originally intended to transfer to the Jiaoji train to Weixian, but Han cordially invited him to stay for breakfast. Feng agreed and rode in the same car with Han to the provincial government. They briefly talked in the chairman's office and then had breakfast: half a bowl of big dishes and half a cornbread, eating his fill. After taking a short rest, Han sent him off with travel expenses of 3,000 yuan. Feng went to the Jiaoji Railway Station. Some of his guards got off the train in Jinan. The 3rd Regiment of the Pistol Brigade (formerly Feng's old guard Peng Guozheng's unit) still accompanied him. Military and political figures all arrived at the station to see him off. The train departed eastward at 10:30 a.m. and was expected to arrive in Weixian in the afternoon. Due to the lateness of the hour, he did not have time to go to Penglai and stayed overnight in Weifang. He set off tomorrow (the 16th) and was expected to arrive in Penglai that day (from Weixian via Pingdu, Yexian, Longkou, Huangxian, etc. to Penglai, a total of 445 li). Chairman Han had already telegraphed Chen Weixin, the director of the Yantai-Weixian Automobile Road Bureau, to prepare a car for Feng to ride in.</p>
<p>According to a long-distance telephone report from Zhoucun, Feng's special train arrived in Zhoucun at 3:00 p.m. Cao Fulin, the commander of the 29th Division, arrived at the station to welcome him. Feng wanted to go to Zouping to visit the Rural Construction Institute, so he borrowed three cars from Cao and took several attendants and a part of the guards to Zouping. Cao immediately informed the Rural Construction Institute and the county magistrate by telephone. Because Liang Shuming, the director of the institute, had gone to Beijing and had not returned, Xu Shuren, the secretary of the institute, and Wang Yike, the county magistrate, and the students went outside Dongguan to welcome him. From Zhoucun to Zouping is only 35 li. Feng got out of the car and exchanged greetings with everyone. At that time, there was a Huangshan Temple fair, and many villagers came to attend the fair. Because Feng had not participated in a village fair for many years, he especially toured the fair. Many villagers gathered to watch. After a while, Feng went to the Rural Construction Institute (because the institute is in Dongguan). Xu Shuren delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of the county. Feng was very humble and gave only a brief speech to the students. Then, photos were taken to commemorate the occasion. At 5:00 p.m., he left Zouping by car, and the teachers and students of the institute and the county magistrate saw him off. At 6:00 p.m., Feng arrived in Zhoucun by car and boarded the train, which departed. He will stay overnight in Weifang tonight and go to Penglai tomorrow (the 15th).</p>
<h3>The "Wheel of Time" Vajra Dharma Assembly Held in Hangzhou Concludes Successfully; Spectacle Unprecedented; Panchen Lama Scheduled to Reside in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Hangzhou Dispatch: Prominent figures from the Party and state, along with celebrities from various sectors, initiated and established the "Wheel of Time" Vajra Dharma Assembly in Hangzhou to pray for peace. The location was Lingyin Temple in West Lake. The Hangzhou office began preparations in early April, arranging the venue with Zhu Manor on Taoguang Road serving as the Panchen Lama's residence. Additionally, five decorated archways adorned with electric lights were erected at locations such as Yanling Road at the train station, Broken Bridge, Yue Tomb, and the main gate of Lingyin Temple. At night, the electric lights shone brightly, a dazzling display of colors. The provincial government repeatedly received telegrams from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Executive Yuan, instructing that the Panchen Lama be received sincerely and protected closely upon his arrival in Hangzhou. Consequently, the Hangzhou Garrison Command, the Municipal Government, and the Provincial Public Security Bureau were ordered to provide reception and protection, with the provincial government allocating 10,000 yuan for reception expenses to meet the needs. The Panchen Lama, along with Secretary-General Dr. Liu Jiaju, Khambo Lamas, bodyguards, and a retinue of over forty people, arrived in Hangzhou at four o'clock in the afternoon on April 26th, traveling along the Jing-Hang National Highway in eight cars. Minister of Personnel Lin Xiang also accompanied them to Hangzhou. Having received prior notice, those welcoming them at Wulin Gate station included Zeng Jianying, representing the provincial government; He Maoqing, representing the municipal government; Tao Shuhui, Qian Wenxuan, and Zhao Hengtang, representing the "Wheel of Time" Dharma Assembly; and over ten thousand members of the public eager to behold the Panchen Lama's compassionate countenance. The Panchen Lama's car stopped at the station for approximately two or three minutes before proceeding directly to Lingyin Temple. Thousands of monks and students from Buddhist primary schools lined the route, waving welcome banners to express their greetings. The Panchen Lama then transferred to a specially prepared yellow silk sedan chair and rested briefly in a specially designated lounge in the Great Compassion Hall. He then met with Shanghai philanthropist Wang Yiting, Shanghai Security Chief Yang Hu, Zhejiang Finance Director Wang Chengying, and Hangzhou gentry Gao Zibai, Zhang Zaiyang, and Qian Wenxuan. In the evening, he attended a banquet hosted by the National Martial Arts Hall and stayed at Zhu Manor, while his retinue lodged at places such as Punan House and Zhou Manor. On the 27th, the provincial and municipal governments hosted a public banquet for the Lama at the Zhongxing Villa, which concluded joyously. The 28th was the day the "Wheel of Time" Vajra Dharma Assembly began its rituals. The Dharma platform was set up in front of the main hall of Lingyin Temple, with a high canopy made of bright tiles. Bamboo canopies were erected on both sides. Ascending the steps from the Heavenly King Hall through the aisle led to the Dharma platform, surrounded by a yellow railing. The Panchen Lama's throne was in the center, with low stools on both sides for the male and female devotees who came to listen to the teachings. Inside the main hall, a precious throne was set up, flanked by eight lower seats for the Panchen Lama and various Khambos to chant scriptures. A broadcasting room was located to the right. The arrangement was solemn and dignified. At 8:30 a.m., all the staff of the assembly burned incense and gathered at Zhu Manor to await the Panchen Lama. At 8:40 a.m., the Panchen Lama departed from Zhu Manor in a yellow sedan chair, led by monks playing musical instruments. Upon arriving at the Dharma platform, he took his seat, followed by the Khambos. Dharma instruments were sounded, bells were rung, and scriptures were chanted. Around 10 a.m., he retired to the Great Compassion Hall to rest. At 1:30 p.m., the Dharma Assembly officiants welcomed the Lama back to the platform. Over six thousand people from all walks of life came to the venue to pay respects to the Buddha. Wang Yiting led his disciples in paying respects first, and the Panchen Lama bestowed wine, incense, and rice upon each of them before they performed full prostrations. The ceremony was grand and solemn. Then, the Panchen Lama delivered a discourse on the essential principles of enlightenment and meditation, praying for the happiness of all those in attendance. The 29th was the day for the grand ceremony of purifying the mandala. Over 14,000 guests arrived. At 4 p.m., the Panchen Lama emerged, adorned in his ceremonial robes, followed by various Lamas carrying Dharma instruments. They circled the mandala three times, performing solemn dances in the Tibetan religious style. This act, known as "driving away the demons" in Tibetan custom, was held annually at the Yonghe Temple during the Qing Dynasty and was considered a grand event. On May 1st, he continued to ascend the seat to preach, and the audience was extremely crowded. The sound of car horns on Lingyin Road was incessant. Public buses ran every five minutes, all fully packed. It was truly a case of "ten thousand people emptying the streets," an unprecedented spectacle. From the 2nd onwards, the Panchen Lama did not ascend the platform to preach due to focusing on internal contemplation. President of the Examination Yuan Dai Chuanxian, his wife, and daughter traveled by car from the Jing-Hang National Highway to Hangzhou, arriving at Lingyin Temple at 6 p.m. to visit the Panchen Lama, engaging in a lengthy conversation. In the evening, the directors of the Dharma Assembly held a reception for Dai in the Lian Deng Pavilion within the temple, and he stayed overnight at the Great Compassion Hall. On the 3rd, which was a day of rest, the monks of Lingyin Temple were invited to chant scriptures together throughout the temple. On the 4th, President Dai hosted a banquet at the Great Compassion Hall, attended by local officials of Zhejiang Province such as Lü Bichou, Wang Chengying, Zhou Xiangxian, and He Yun, as well as Wang Yiting, Wang Xiaolai, Qu Wenliu, Shi Liangcai, Zhao Yanwu, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, and over forty others. During the banquet, Dai reported on his inspection tour of the Northwest, where he witnessed the harmonious co-residence of Han, Tibetan, Mongolian, and Hui ethnic groups. On the 7th, 8th, 10th, and 13th, the Lama continued to ascend the platform to preach. Foreign guests from afar also came to visit, including a group of twenty-four people, including the American Navy Christian Young Men’s Association secretary, Simaici, Professor Smith of the University of Paris, France, clerk of Annam Governor’s Office, Kesson George and Vice President of Hanoi Bank, Zhanmu, and Chief Engineer of Hanoi Construction Bureau, Qiaolai, Japanese Consul General in Hangzhou, Matsumura Yuzo, and many others. The Austrian World Daily reporter Danerbei also came to the meeting to take pictures. The Lama’s representative to Tibet, Anqin Hutuktu, and the representatives of the monks and common people of the Houzang, Dingji Hutuktu and his retinue of fifty Lamas, came to Hangzhou on the evening of the 7th to attend the Dharma Assembly, and urged the Panchen Lama to return to Tibet as soon as possible to preside over political and religious affairs. The reporter met with Ambassador Anqin yesterday. According to him, he and Wang Luojie, Secretary-General of the Lama, stayed in Tibet for eight months and met the Dalai Lama four times. The Dalai Lama sincerely expressed his willingness to cooperate with the Panchen Lama, ordering him to telegraph the Lama to expedite his return to Tibet to take charge of the government. The rulers of the three major monasteries in Tibet and the entire Tibetan people all hoped that the Panchen Lama would return to Tibet as soon as possible. Later, the Dalai Lama became seriously ill and gave a handwritten letter to him to bring back to the Panchen Lama to persuade him to return. Therefore, the Lama must return to Tibet in the near future. The date will be determined by the Central Government. The arrangement of the Dharma Assembly’s altar was extremely costly and well-managed. The Panchen Lama personally instructed the Khambos and Lamas to divide the work. It took nine days to complete. In the center of the altar, surrounded by several square cities in the southeast, northwest and northeast, outside the square city are the signs of constellations and the signs of the gods. In addition, there are four circles, representing the forms of earth, water, wind, and fire: earth yellow, water white, fire red, and wind black. There is a gate in each of the four directions, each with three layers. The north is white, the south is red, the west is heavy, and the east is black. Each gate has one guarding deity, for a total of one hundred and forty-four guarding deities throughout the altar. Inside the first layer of each gate, there is a treasure cart, pulled by seven beasts. The outermost layer has a protective wheel with fierce flames, creating a magnificent and precise setup. The initiator of the Dharma Assembly, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Chu Minyi, came to Hangzhou with his wife and Wang President’s mother-in-law on the afternoon of the 11th to participate. He went to visit President Dai and talked with him on the morning of the 12th. Mr. Ban met Mrs. Li Yuanhong and Shanghai Mayor’s representative Yang Hu at the residence. Yang presented Wu Tiecheng’s letter, welcoming the Master to Shanghai to reside. At 11:00, he met Mr. and Mrs. Chu Minyi. On the 13th, although the master felt a little unwell, he still went to the seat at 6:30 in the morning to read scriptures. From 2:00 p.m., the initiation ceremony was held. Those who attended included Dai Jitao and his wife, Chu Minyi and his wife, Lin Xiang, Huang Fusheng, Niu Yongjian, Wu Tiecheng, Wang Yiting, Zhang Xiaolin, Tao Shuhui, Zhang Zaiyang, and more than 20,000 people. The Panchen Lama ascended the seat to recite scriptures, which was translated by Liu Jiaju, and the Khambos distributed Dharma rice, auspicious grass, and red ropes, etc. The Star Film Company also filmed the Dharma Assembly on the spot until 6:00 p.m. On the morning of the 14th, the Panchen Lama still came to the Dharma platform to practice Dharma. In the afternoon, at 3:00 p.m., the official initiation was held, including the Bottle Initiation, the Buddha Crown Initiation, and the distribution of Dharma rice, Tibetan lotus, the distribution of eye cloths, and the sprinkling of Dharma water. The wish to initiate the believers to enter the inner altar tent before accepting the initiation was fulfilled at 7:30 in the afternoon. On the morning of the 15th, scriptures were recited. In the afternoon, at 3:00 p.m., the master ascended the seat to give a lecture, which was translated by Liu Jiaju. At about 4:00 p.m., the strap initiation bell and pestle initiation, the severe decoration initiation, and the blessing initiation were held. At 7:00 p.m., he left the seat. Yesterday (16th) was a day of rest, and he thanked and met the guests. Today (17th) the Humo Ceremony will be held, and the altar will be sent off on the 18th. The Panchen Lama is scheduled to take a car along the highway to Shanghai on the 20th to reside before returning to Beijing. (15th)</p>
<h3>After Five Encirclement Campaigns, the Bandit Areas in Jiangxi Province Shrink; Comparison of Bandit Areas Over the Past Four Months</h3>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Since the start of the fifth encirclement campaign by the National Army, the bandit areas in Jiangxi and Fujian provinces have been gradually recovered. Recently, the Northern Route Army captured Guangchang, the Southern Route Army recovered Yunmenling, and the Eastern Route Army occupied Liancheng. The bandit areas have gradually shrunk. Here is a detailed monthly comparison of the bandit areas in Jiangxi Province this year, from January to April:</p>
<p>Northeast Jiangxi Bandit Area: At the border of Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces, the area occupied by the bandits in January extended from the south of Dexing County in the north to Hengfeng County in the south, from Zhengjiafang in Yushan County in the east to Qigongzhen in the northeast of Yiyang County in the west. The bandit leader was Fang Zhimin. In February, our army successively recovered Zhengjiafang, Jiangjiafang, Xiacun, Shantian, and Qigongzhen, forming a blockade line, cutting off the connection between the bandits in Hengfeng County and the bandits in Nanquanxia, Dexing County. In March, our army also recovered Hengfeng County, gradually clearing the bandits in various districts under its jurisdiction. In April, bandit leader Fang Zhimin was severely injured by our air force in the Battle of Geyuan. Most of the puppet troops led by the bandit surrendered to our army.</p>
<p>Southeast Jiangxi Bandit Area: At the junction of Fujian and Jiangxi, the counties occupied by the bandits included Guangchang and Ningdu in the north, Longgang, Xingguo, Yudu in the west, Fuyou, Huichang, and Yunmenling, and Shicheng and Ruijin in the east, which were their old nests. The above counties were the main bases of the Jiangxi bandits, and their main bandit forces were the puppet first, third, fifth, seventh, and ninth army corps, all stationed in the above areas. In February, our two armies of the thirty-sixth route marched southward, and the sixth route army successively recovered Tengtian and Shaxi, approaching Longgang. The third route army marched south from Nanfeng and occupied Zhangcun, Hengcun, Baishexu, and other places in the northeast of Guangchang County. In March, the Southern Route Army recovered Yunmenling. Our Northern Route Army gathered its forces to prepare for a general offensive on Guangchang, the lifeline of the bandits. After more than ten days of preparation, in April, the National Army fought a bloody battle with the bandits in Guangchang for more than ten days, and finally recovered Guangchang, the bandits' choke point for heading north. The Sixth Route Army also captured Longgang this month, approaching Xingguo. At this time, the Western Route Army also advanced eastward from Wan'an to join forces with the Sixth Route Army, preparing to jointly attack Xingguo and block the bandits' attempt to flee westward.</p>
<p>Southwest Jiangxi Bandit Area: The bandits occupied the entire territory of Yongxin County. By February, the bandit area was completely cleared by the National Army. The remaining bandit troops, the puppet seventeenth and eighteenth divisions, fled to the Huangjiang, Yuantou, and Huaxi areas in the northwest of Yongxin County to harass the area. In March, our Western Route Army annihilated the remaining bandits. Therefore, at present, the bandit areas in Jiangxi only include the six counties of Shicheng, Ruijin, Huichang, Xingguo, Yudu, and Ningdu. (Inside and outside agencies)</p>
<h3>Boshan Coal Mine Joint Sales Company Borrowing</h3>
<p>Fully Guaranteed by the Provincial and Municipal Governments</p>
<p>Borrowing 500,000 Yuan from the Banking Group</p>
<p>Qingdao Dispatch: In order to develop the mining industry in Shandong Province and improve its external creditworthiness, the Shandong Provincial Government and the Qingdao Municipal Government previously sent personnel to Boshan to urge mine owners to organize a joint production and sales company, concentrating their efforts to facilitate operations. However, due to the recent business downturn and financial difficulties of various mining companies, there was a motion to borrow money from the Qingdao-Jinan banking group. Zhang Honglie, Director of the Shandong Construction Department, came to Qingdao from Jinan on the 8th of this month specifically for this matter, meeting with Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie to discuss borrowing methods. He also invited representatives of the Boshan mining industry to Qingdao to coordinate everything. Shen held a banquet at the Yingbing Hotel on the evening of the 9th to entertain Zhang and the mining representatives, with representatives from the local banking community as guests. During the banquet, the borrowing and repayment procedures were discussed. Local banks expressed their willingness to jointly undertake the loan of 1.5 million yuan to the joint sales company with the Jinan banking community, but regarding the guarantee layer, each coal mining company must guarantee in a connected loop and each company must have their private seal, to show seriousness. Representatives of the mine owners thought that because of the different circumstances of the various companies, and that because the guarantee had to be in a connecting loop, they would have to return to Boshan to convene a meeting of the companies before they dared to decide. Shen was deeply concerned that the matter would be delayed if the representatives returned to Boshan, and that it would not be successful for three to five months. In order to expedite the establishment, he reconvened a meeting of coal mine representatives and bankers at the Municipal Government on the 14th to discuss the matter. Official attendees included Mayor Shen, Director Zhang, and Chu Zhen (Director of the Social Affairs Bureau), as well as bank representatives Wang Zuxun (Bank of China), Cu Ba (Bank of Communications), Zhang Yutian (Zhonglu Bank), and Wei Zihou (Shandong Minsheng Bank). Mine owner representatives included Zhuang Shuting (Tongxing Company), Zhu Yaoru (Huadong Company), Wang Lüqian (Dacheng Company), Liang Xisan (Yonghe Company), Ding Liangchen (Yuesheng Company), and Yu Zijing (Dongfang Company). It was resolved that the borrowing of funds by the joint sales company from the bank would be fully guaranteed by the provincial and municipal governments, but the amount of the loan would be reduced to 500,000 yuan, to be used as working capital for the company. It was also stipulated that the company must be established within one month, with one auditor assigned by each the provincial and municipal government, and one accountant assigned by the banking group, stationed permanently at the company. For every ton of coal transported, 5 jiao would be collected to repay the guarantee money (it is estimated that the Boshan coal mines can produce 90,000 tons of coal per month, which is a monthly receipt of 45,000 yuan, so this money can be repaid within a year). After the resolution was made, the people in the court signed in turn, and the borrowing problem was completely successful. The outline of the agreed loan is as follows: (1) At the request of the Boshan Mining Production and Sales Company, the provincial and municipal governments shall borrow money from the banking group in accordance with the conventions and the guarantee conditions and repayment methods proposed by the representatives for the use of the joint production and sales company, and shall be fully responsible to the banking group for the handling. (1) The mineral production and sales company shall be established within one month, select the important responsible personnel of the company, start working, and send personnel to the banking group to negotiate the procedures and contact with the use of funds, but the production and sales company must present the plan for the distribution of the use of funds to the provincial and municipal governments for approval. (1) After the establishment of the production and sales company, all previous business rights of the coal industry should be specified and maintained in detail, and should not hinder its inherent business. (1) In order to guarantee the repayment of debts, the provincial and municipal governments each send an auditor and the banking group sends an accountant to the company after its establishment. In accordance with the contract signed between the company and the banking group, when each coal-producing company transports coal, the accountant of the banking group will collect 50 cents per ton before it can be transported. (1) The auditors sent by the provincial and municipal governments and the accountants sent by the banking group must check the accounts at any time and report to the provincial and municipal governments and the banking group on a monthly basis to clarify responsibilities.</p>
<p>Construction Department Director Zhang Honglie made a special trip on the first train to Jinan on the evening of the 16th to report to the provincial government, as the borrowing business had been negotiated. The coal mine representatives also planned to take the same train west on the evening to return to Boshan. (15th)</p>

The management of expenses should be clear and avoid the past malpractices of unclear accounts. It is heard that the meeting was originally scheduled for half a day, but because of discussions on the interim rules for handling projects, the meeting continued in the afternoon. Other trivial matters from various counties were handled separately by the relevant personnel of the Construction Department. It is also heard that Jiangpu County was listed as a participating unit in today's talks, but the county did not send anyone to attend, so the Construction Department ordered the county to send a representative in the next session and not to be negligent.

<h3>Wuxi: Silkworm Model Area Implements Control</h3>
<p>Yan Shenyu, Director of the Silkworm Model Area, and Cai Jingde, Deputy Director, because the spring cocoon flood season is approaching in a blink of an eye, and all important matters such as restricting cocoon lines and registering cocoon merchants need to be resolved urgently, so according to the resolutions of the Silkworm Industry Improvement Management Committee of the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department, a design committee was organized, and fifteen leaders of silk cocoons, such as Xue Shouxuan, Qian Fenghao, and Cheng Bingruo, were hired as members to handle silkworm improvement matters. Yesterday, Director Yan held the first meeting at the Model Area Office of the Silkworm Seed Testing Ground outside Ximen, and the following important cases were decided: 1.

<h3>Implement Measures to Ban Silk Factories</h3>
<p>In order to eliminate speculation in silk manufacturers and protect wages and avoid disputes, the Jiangsu Construction Department has formulated silk factory banning measures. All factories that rent factories must pay a deposit according to the number of vehicles. Later, some factories that had not been banned before the banning measures were promulgated presented requests for exemption from payment. Now it has been ordered that the banning measures are to protect workers' wages and support the proper development of the silk industry. Regardless of whether they are newly opened or old ones, they should be restricted by these measures and should not take advantage of tricks. The county government is ordered to transfer the silk factory association and order all factories to comply within a week. If there is any deliberate violation, the Public Security Bureau will be ordered to ban them.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Resolution of Business Tax Issues</h3>
<p>The Wuyi Business Tax Bureau has recently been ordered to conduct an advance investigation in order to determine the tax amount for the 23rd year. Director Zhou Shuzi dispatched personnel to various districts for investigation in accordance with the provincial methods. However, some merchants were afraid of increasing the tax amount after the investigation, and some dissidents caused obstacles during the investigation. Later, County Magistrate Cai contacted the Chamber of Commerce several times, and the Chamber of Commerce convened a meeting of various industries to decide to increase the amount of business appropriately, fill out the declaration forms and send them to the bureau. After the bureau rechecked and submitted to the department for approval, all disputes during the investigation were resolved. Since yesterday (15th), in addition to continuing to send personnel to investigate, the bureau also collected summer taxes. The increase in business volume is mostly one to three percent, and the least is about one percent.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing: Dongmen Robbery Case Solved</h3>
<p>The Jiaxing Dongmen Yingzi Road Henan native Han Yunpan straw shed suddenly reported a robbery the day before yesterday. At that time, the county public security bureau's entire detective team of detectives and police officers set out to hunt down the suspects. Because it was late at night, they were unable to capture the suspects. It is now known that the detective team has successively arrested three people, including Fang Yunchang, in Dongmen and Nanmen. All of them are from Yancheng. However, their confessions are extremely cunning and are still being investigated.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Villagers Assault Police During Festival Competition</h3>
<p>In the vicinity of Dazhuang Village, near Guazhou Village, villagers held a festival competition to welcome the gods. Using the New Life Movement as a pretext, they defied the prohibition by the chief of the Public Security Bureau. They also surrounded and severely injured the patrol leader and security guards, seized their firearms, and gathered a crowd to cause disturbances. Fearing the situation would escalate, Chief Liao of the Public Security Bureau sent an urgent telegram to the county government seeking instructions. County Magistrate Ma, upon receiving the report, immediately dispatched Deputy Commander Lu, along with Zhao Shipu, the chief of the Public Security Special Task Force, to assist in handling the situation. Fearing that reactionary elements might be instigating the events, a special request was made to the County Party Headquarters to send personnel to investigate and help quell the unrest to prevent the situation from escalating.</p>

<h3>Newspaper Association Hosted Banquet for Guangdong-Hong Kong Press Inspection Group Yesterday</h3>

<p>They will inspect war zones such as Zhabei today.</p>
<p>They will take the night train from Shanghai to Beijing tonight.</p>
<p>The Guangdong-Hong Kong press domestic inspection group, after arriving in Shanghai from Hong Kong this Monday, has been busy visiting various places in recent days. The Shanghai Newspaper Association hosted a banquet at the Huaan Building yesterday afternoon to fulfill their duty as hosts. It is understood that the group is scheduled to visit the International Radio Station and Jinan University, and to inspect the war zones of Zhabei and Wusong today before taking the night train to Beijing to visit the capital's construction. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Visited Newspaper Offices</h3>
<p>All members of the group departed at 7:00 AM yesterday. They were originally scheduled to visit the Wusong Fort and inspect the ruins of the war zones in the Jiangwan Zhabei area. The municipal government sent officials to guide them in several cars. However, the drivers were unfamiliar with the route, so the cars traveled for a long time and failed to reach their destination. The cars were driven to Yangshupu, turned back to the Yong'an Yarn Factory, toured for a week, and returned. At 2:30 PM, accompanied by Mr. Xu Xinyi, the group visited the Minbao, China Daily, Shenbao, Xinwenbao, Shibao, and Shishi Xinbao. The visit ended at 7:00 PM. The group then attended a banquet hosted by Zhonghua Zhongbao. After the banquet, the group visited Chenbao at 9:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Inspecting the War Zone</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Hu Zhiwu, a member of the group and a reporter for the Xinxin News Agency, the entire group was originally scheduled to visit the Wusong Fort and inspect the Zhabei war zone yesterday morning. Unfortunately, yesterday's driver was unfamiliar with the route and mistakenly drove the car elsewhere, failing to go there, which was a great pity. It was rescheduled for tomorrow (i.e. today). It is also understood that the group will go to Zhenru to visit the International Radio Station and Jinan University this morning. This afternoon, they will gather at the invitation of the China Cultural Association to celebrate. They will take the night express train to Beijing at 11:00 PM to visit the capital and inspect all construction in the capital.</p>
<h3>Newspaper Association Banquet</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Newspaper Association, in order to enhance friendship between colleagues in Guangdong and Shanghai, held a public banquet at the Huaan Building on the eighth floor yesterday afternoon. Except for Zhong Zheng of Guangzhou's Gongpingbao, who was unable to attend due to a matter, representatives from the following newspapers attended: Wen Xinggong from Hong Kong's Xunhuan Daily, Xunhuan Evening News, Daguanbao, and Guangzhou's Xin Guohua Bao; Liang Yuzhang from Hong Kong's Huazi Daily; Hu Zhiwu from Hong Kong's Gongshang Daily, Gongshang Evening News, and Tianguangbao; Chen Kewen from Hong Kong's Nanhua Daily; Wei Guolun from Hong Kong's Huaqiao Daily, Nanzhongbao, and Nanqiangbao; Zhong Chaoqun from Guangzhou's Gongpingbao; Chen Jiarui from Guangzhou's Chengbao.

<h3>Chairman's Speech</h3>
<p>During the banquet, Chairman Pan Gongzhan delivered a welcome speech, stating, "Today, members of our association and colleagues from various newspaper offices welcome the domestic inspection group of colleagues from the Guangdong and Hong Kong press, which is a great pleasure. All of you present here serve in the press and share a great mission. In this autumn of national crisis, service is particularly difficult. Although Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Shanghai are in different locations, the feelings we receive are the same. Just as the September 18th Incident occurred in the Northeast and the January 28th Incident occurred in Shanghai, the pain experienced by Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Shanghai is exactly the same. The Japanese ambition to invade China has not ceased for a day.</p>
<h3>Photo of the Hong Kong-Guangdong Press Inspection Group Visiting Our Newspaper (Photographed by Xu Tianzhang)</h3>
<p>The more we, as members of the press, feel and are touched by it. For the sake of the entire nation, we must work together to create public opinion, so that the whole country, both in and out of the government, is united from top to bottom, cooperating with each other, so that our country can be internally united and become one body, to act as a backing for the government, and to fight against the evil forces. Our mission can be said to be more important than any other sector, especially during this time of serious national crisis, when the influence of public opinion is even greater. I hope that the press in Guangdong, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and all other regions will work together to remind the people and urge the government to save the dying national destiny. I also hope that your group, when you have completed your inspection of Central and Northern China and return to the south, will contribute your observations to the authorities and people of Guangdong and Hong Kong in South China, in the hope of promoting a healthy combination of compatriots across the country during this time of serious national crisis. All of this is due to the creation of your inspection, and it is no small contribution to the country. I am willing to contribute my humble thoughts. I wish you all a healthy journey and promote unity," etc.</p>
<h3>Mr. Hu's Reply</h3>
<p>Next, Hu Zhiwu, the representative of the inspection group, delivered a reply, stating, "Our group is very honored to be hosted by your association today, and I would like to express my gratitude. As for the purpose of this visit, it has been published in various newspapers in the past few days. My colleagues in the group feel that the relationship between Shanghai, Guangdong, and Hong Kong is very close. Although you are meeting us for the first time, our spiritual connection has been long-standing. When we read Shanghai newspapers in Guangdong and Hong Kong, we admire them very much. We have come here to visit and learn a lot. My colleagues in Guangdong and Hong Kong all feel that the development of the news industry is urgent. However, the inspection of news in the local area is very strict, and one or two newspapers in Hong Kong have suffered great losses, which has hindered the development of news. Furthermore, the increase in newspaper postage has had a tremendous impact. The decline of industry and commerce in our area is also abnormal, and the import of foreign goods is huge. This is a major crisis in the southwest, and our group has reported it for national attention. As for seeking national unity, it is not just empty words, but we should seek a unified approach. When there is no national press group, it is particularly difficult. Our group hopes that there will soon be an organization such as the National Press Federation, so that the internal and external statements of the press can be jointly discussed in a unified direction, and all obstacles faced by the press can be resolved. I would like to contribute these insights to the gentlemen of your association and colleagues from all over the country," etc.</p>
<h3>Press in Guangdong and Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Next, Group Representative Liang Yuzhang reported on the recent situation of the press in Guangdong and Hong Kong as follows: (1) Guangzhou: 17 morning newspapers, 3 evening newspapers, 2 English newspapers, 40 news agencies. The daily circulation of morning and evening newspapers is about 290,000 copies, and English newspapers circulate several thousand. Advertising revenue is about 210,000 to 220,000 yuan per month. Due to the unsuitability of local paper and the heavy taxation of foreign paper, costs have increased. In addition, the government's strict crackdown on pharmaceutical advertisements has also affected advertising revenue. (2) Hong Kong: 17 morning and evening newspapers, 4 English newspapers, 2 official news agencies. The total daily circulation of morning and evening newspapers is about 200,000 copies, with two-thirds sold locally and one-third sold in other regions. English newspapers circulate less than 10,000 copies. Foreign advertisements account for the majority of advertising revenue, totaling more than 220,000 yuan per month.

<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Asks the Salt Affairs Administration to Correct Salt Merchants' Price Increases</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Salt Affairs Administration of the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: "To the esteemed Administration, on the 15th of this month, we received a letter from the Sauce and Wine Industry Guild stating, 'We have found that salt, an essential daily necessity for the people, has been repeatedly increased in price, which harms the livelihood of ordinary people. The quality is poor, which is closely related to hygiene. If these problems are not eliminated, how can we convince the people? It is thought that our country has a great deal of salt production in various places. Since state-owned enterprises, there has been no concept of competition, resulting in increasingly poor salt quality. Compared with refined salt, the difference in ingredients is immediately apparent. Furthermore, salt merchants cheat, with each package being short by one or two jin, or even two or three jin. In addition to the salt package, another bag is added, and the weight of this package is not deducted. On December 21 of last year, the price of salt increased from 7 yuan 7 jiao 6 fen to 9 yuan. On February 1 of this year, it was changed to city weight, but the price was not reduced. Recently, there has been a gradual increase in price, and it is said that it must be increased to the same price as the levied salt. It is not clear whether this price increase is legal, and we dare not speculate. Since there is no clear statement published by the competent authority, the authorities attach great importance to public health. Why is there no hope for improvement in salt, which is a daily necessity? Since the price of salt has already increased, the problem of short weight and the burden of packaging should be eliminated. The repeated increase in salt prices without limits is not a way to sympathize with ordinary people.' Therefore, we urge your esteemed organization to forward this request to the Salt Affairs Administration of the Ministry of Finance, so that the price of salt can be determined, clearly announced, and the abuses of packaging, short weight, and so on can be promptly eliminated. At the same time, the quality of salt should be improved, which would greatly benefit the lives and livelihoods of the people." After investigation, the salt in our country is subject to a monopoly system, and the price is set by the government, so the freight merchants should be legally restricted in terms of price increases and false reporting of weight. How can they simply operate for private gain and exploit the common people? According to the aforementioned letter, the request to determine the price, make a clear announcement, and eliminate the abuses of packaging and short weight is a legitimate request. We are corresponding to the situation and asking your esteemed Administration to approve the registration and implementation, which is sincerely a public duty.</p>
<h3>US Minister Leaves for Beijing Last Night: Visited Mayor Wu Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>US Minister to China Johnson came to Shanghai from Beijing this Tuesday to meet with Rogers, the silver expert specially sent to China by US President Roosevelt to investigate the silver price issue, to discuss and resolve matters. It is understood that Mr. Johnson, accompanied by his secretary, went to the city center by car at approximately 11:00 AM yesterday to visit Mayor Wu. Mayor Wu personally received him, and they spoke for about twenty minutes before he left. It was purely a visit of courtesy. Mr. Johnson has now completed his business in Shanghai and left for Beijing last night at 11:00 PM aboard the Beijing-Shanghai Railway night train. He will then transfer north to visit Mount Tai and Qufu, and return to Beijing to attend to official duties around the end of this month.</p>
<h3>Strength of Troops Stationed in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News stated that Mr. Knox, a member of the British House of Commons, stated in the House on Monday that the French and Japanese troops stationed in Shanghai have exceeded the number of British troops. If the United States increases the number of troops stationed in Shanghai, then Britain will be relegated to fourth place. A reporter from the North China Daily News made a special trip to various related parties yesterday to ascertain the exact number of troops from the four countries stationed in Shanghai. According to the headquarters of the 4th Marine Regiment of the United States Marine Corps, there are a total of 1,800 US troops stationed in Shanghai, which are the three battalions of the 4th Regiment. There is no plan to increase the number. Since 200 to 300 troops were added in September 1932, forming the current number, there have been no increases or decreases. Recently, Lieutenant General Ballardman came to Shanghai, and there were rumors outside that the number of troops would be increased. In fact, this trip was solely for review purposes and cannot be regarded as the US government's intention to increase the number of troops stationed in Shanghai. The number of British troops stationed in Shanghai has been officially announced by Cooper, a financial officer of the Army Department, as a total of 1,071. As for the total number of Japanese troops stationed in Shanghai, the Japanese Consulate General stated yesterday that there are 1,500 to 1,600 naval marines, whose barracks are located near Hongkou Park. According to the French military headquarters, there are a total of 1,450 French troops stationed in Shanghai, most of whom are colonial infantry. Including those stationed in Hankou and Guangzhou, there are 1,700 in total.</p>

<h3>Fishing Villages Urgently Need Relief</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reported that since the organization of the Territorial Waters Fishing Rights Protection Association, the local fishing industry groups have been conducting a secret investigation into the Dahua Fishing Vessel Company incident. They have obtained a great deal of conclusive evidence, which has been printed into photographs and pamphlets, and will ask the Ministry of Industry to impose strict sanctions. They will also hold a meeting on Friday, the 17th of this month, to discuss the final response methods. According to Mr. Jin Chuxiang of the Fisheries Inspection Chouhuo Association, there are several points that must be reported to the people of the country. (1) There are hundreds of Japanese fishing vessels fishing illegally, and the rights of state-owned fishing industries have been almost completely deprived. Today, the crisis of bankruptcy in our country's fishing villages is no less than the situation of bankruptcy in rural areas. In fact, the scope and interests of our country's fishing villages are very broad. Today, if we want to relieve the countryside, we should start with relieving the fishing villages. (2) Recently, Japanese people have colluded with our country's unscrupulous merchants to deceive our government and issue fishing vessel licenses, impersonating national goods and evading national taxes. This matter is of great concern to our country's financial resources. If the government does not investigate this strictly, the consequences will be unimaginable. It is hoped that our superiors and inferiors will work hard so that the millions of fishermen in our country will not be driven to desperation, which would be a fortunate event.</p>

<h3>The Pudong Telephone Underwater Cable Damaged Again - Damaged Twice in Three Days by Anchoring Ships</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications has a 50-pair underwater cable between Gaochang Temple in the South City and Zhoujiadu in Pudong, along with one underwater cable each from the Pudong Electric Company and the Telegraph Bureau, all in the same location. Warning signs were set up on both banks, and they have been in good condition since they were put into use. However, unexpectedly, at noon on the 11th of this month, the Xinhua steamship damaged it by dropping anchor on the river surface at that location. Engineers Yu, Xu, and Wu from the bureau immediately sent workers to repair it day and night, and negotiated compensation with the steamship company. The communication was restored on the afternoon of the 13th. However, just three days later, on the morning of the 16th, the "Ivanhoe" steamship dropped anchor and broke the underwater cable along with the electric power cables, which was very unfortunate. It is reported that the extent of the damage this time is greater than before. In addition to sending workers to repair it again, the telephone bureau is said to have begun negotiating with the steamship company for compensation for the loss.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Province: Recent News on the Control of Foreign Fertilizer Merchants</h3>

The measures for controlling and managing fertilizers have long been announced and implemented. Any fertilizer shop opened in Jiangsu Province, except those directly entrusted by the construction department for consignment sales or those specially appointed by agency merchants for sales, whether wholesale or retail, or newly established, shall, fifteen days before opening, submit the name of the shop, the location of the shop, the total amount of capital, the type of fertilizer sold, the name of the manager, and other items to the Department of Construction for approval and issuance of a license before opening. Those who have already opened before the promulgation of these measures shall complete the above procedures within ten days after the promulgation of these measures. Fertilizer shops that have already been licensed shall, within ten days after obtaining the license, fill out a report form, indicating the type and quantity of fertilizer prepared for sale this year, and prepare the registration fee, and send it to the Department of Construction for review and registration, and issuance of a registration certificate.

<h3>The Price of Chinese Yarn Slightly Increases, and the Yarn Factories Will Not Reduce Work Again</h3>

<h3>The French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association Held a Joint Meeting of Directors and Supervisors Yesterday, Deciding to Continue Negotiations on Increasing the Number of Chinese Directors and Requesting the Public Works Department to Exempt Silver Shops from Health Donations</h3>
<p>The French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors at 3:00 p.m. yesterday.

Chairman Du Yuesheng was absent due to a trip to Hangzhou. Cheng Zhusun presided over the meeting, and Shao Bingyuan recorded the minutes. The following cases were discussed: 1. The chairman reported on the implementation of the resolutions of the previous meeting and read the original text of the second letter from French Consul Meriel regarding the prohibition of dog racing and jai alai courts. 2. The Sixth District Branch of the Citizens' Association sent a letter stating that Azhong, the eight-year-old only son of Citizen Long Tang, was injured and killed by a car from the Kangti Road and Fenghfeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory when it entered the factory. The victim was the only son of the family and relied on him for life. When the case was reported to the Traffic Department of the French Police, the family was expelled and their case was not accepted, which was a disregard for human life and will make citizens feel insecure in the future. The association was requested to assist in the negotiation. After Wu Guowei, a representative from the district branch, attended the meeting and reported the details of the incident, it was resolved that the district branch should provide additional details of the incident and the reasons for the case to the association, which would then forward it to the French authorities to file a public prosecution in accordance with the law to protect civil rights. 3. The Second District Branch of the Citizens' Association sent a letter stating that the French Public Works Department had levied a classified health business tax on silver shops, arguing that silver shops, gold shops, and other shops had already paid seasonal silver, gold, and other taxes, and there was no need to pay a business tax again, requesting that this be stopped. It was resolved that a letter be sent to the French authorities to request an exemption. 4. The Fourth District and Tenth District Branches of the Citizens' Association and other district branches sent letters requesting clarification of the regulations on awning taxes. It was resolved that, according to the regulations in the 94th issue of the French Public Works Department's Chinese bulletin, canopy taxes are calculated by the foot, and awning taxes are levied at $1.50 per room, with a fixed tax of 70 cents. Citizens should pay taxes according to this principle, and any extra extortion should be reported to the association for negotiation. 5. Regarding the issue of increasing the number of Chinese directors, it was resolved that, according to the chairman's postponement of one month at the previous meeting, which has now expired, and there has been no formal response, Cheng and Shang, the two vice-chairmen, should be publicly elected to inquire with Chairman Du, and a public letter should be prepared to urge the negotiation, otherwise the original plan will be followed. 6. The resignation letter of Executive Committee Member Xu Xiuting was resolved with a unanimous retention. 7. The French Public Works Department's Chinese Bulletin should be distributed to the district branches of the Citizens' Association on a regular basis for distribution to the ratepayers. If there are any omissions, they can be directly obtained from the association. Each committee member of the association will receive one copy per period, which will be sent by the association. 8. The Sino-French Obstetrics Hospital at No. 181 Fuxu Road sent a letter requesting an exemption from the house tax. It was resolved that a letter should be sent to the French Public Works Department to request an exemption based on the circumstances. The meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>The "Shen Bao Monthly" Held Its Fourth Forum</h3>
<p>The "Shen Bao Monthly" has held three forums in the past, discussing the following topics: the first was "The Northeast Issue and the World War," the second was "The Causes of the Decline of Chinese Villages and Methods of Relief," and the third was "The Troubles and Outlets of Today's Youth." The records were published in the second and fourth issues of the first volume and the first issue of the second volume of the magazine, respectively, and were well received by all sectors. Because China's foreign troubles are becoming increasingly urgent and there are few diplomatic solutions, the magazine held its fourth forum on the night before last (the 15th) at the China Society to discuss "The Gains and Losses of the Three Diplomatic Routes of Geneva, Moscow, and Tokyo." The attendees included Zhao Zhengping, Chen Gaoyong, Fan Zhongyun, Zhang Naiqi, Shen Zhiyuan, Bi Yuncheng, Chen Binhe, Liang Lizhi, Hu Yuzhi, Chen Zehua, Liu Zhanen, Yu Huancheng, and others, totaling sixteen people. The discussion started at 6:30 p.m. and ended at 10:30 p.m., discussing the topic for a full four hours. The attendees were all scholars, and the speeches and debates expressed on the spot had unique insights. The speeches were recorded by Li Peilin, who was specially invited by the magazine, and the editors of the magazine also took notes. These records will be published in the June issue of the magazine after they are sorted out. Whether China has a way out in foreign affairs and where the way out lies is a question that lingers in the minds of every citizen. The topic discussed at the magazine's forum is the question that everyone wants to understand and answer. Therefore, it is expected that the records of the meeting will attract the attention of the Chinese people after they are published next month.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Public Security Bureau Hires Wu Kaisheng as Legal Counsel</h3>

<h3>Another Communist Party Member Surrenders</h3>
<p>— Fang Yuanmin</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Fang Yuanmin (also known as Fang Zhiping), the chief writer of the organ newspaper of the Communist Party's Trade Union, was arrested by the special agents of the Public Security Bureau in conjunction with the Public Concession Police in the Hongkou District on the 12th of this month and transferred to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. The Communist Party member deeply regretted taking the wrong path and surrendered to the Public Security Bureau yesterday, and issued a declaration of surrender, saying: I am an intellectual who has received higher education. At first, I took full enthusiasm to seek the truth of politics. In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, I joined the Kuomintang. In the seventeenth year, I entered the Central Party Affairs School. After graduation, I served as the secretary of the Organization Department and the Training Department in the Jiangsu Provincial Party Department. At that time, because my enthusiasm was too high, I was immediately related to the reorganization faction due to local and individual dissatisfaction with the phenomenon at that time. Soon, I also served as the standing committee member of the Jiangsu Province of the reorganization faction, but the reorganization faction still called me disillusionment. I resolutely left all my positions and work at that time and leaned towards communism. In the nineteenth year, I went to Japan to study. During my study period, I first participated in the masses led by the Chinese Communist Party in Tokyo, organized the Emerging Science Research Association (later renamed the Tokyo Branch of the Chinese Social Scientists Alliance) and the Tokyo Branch of the Free Movement League, and then joined the Communist Party branch there and took responsibility as the secretary. After being forced to return home from Japan, I also served as a standing committee member of the National Free Movement League, a standing committee member of the Soviet Central Preparation Committee, a standing committee member of the Social Federation, the chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Trade Union Committee, and the chairman of the Shop Employees' Union Committee. Most recently, I served as the chief writer of the organ newspaper of the Trade Union. In this long-term political career, I felt that I was only moving further and further into disillusionment. In particular, the five years of life in the Communist Party made me deeply understand the wrong line of the Communist Party's destruction of the Chinese revolution and the destruction of the Chinese nation. The central slogan of the Communist Party is class struggle, and the interests of the class outweigh the interests of the nation. It is willing to forcibly create mutual harm between classes in industrially backward China, and is unwilling to use the power of the entire nation to deal with the national crisis. China's main enemies are imperialism and the remaining feudal forces, but the Communist Party does not think about this, but does its best to destroy the united front of the entire nation. When the War of Resistance Against Japan is underway, the Communist Party takes the opportunity to disrupt the rear, and wants soldiers to oppose their superiors and destroy the War of Resistance Against Japan. When the whole country demands unity, the Communist Party is actually carrying out feudal separatism under the slogan of "striving for the first victory in one province and several provinces." Because the Communist Party has such wrong lines and conspiracies, the organization of the Communist Party and the belief in the masses have come to the final stage of collapse, especially since the September 18th Incident. Let's see, the widespread and in-depth surrender of the Communist Party is from individual to whole batches, from old cadres to the general red masses, which has simply formed an unstoppable wave. The Red Bandits are shrinking rapidly. Now, except for the so-called pseudo-Central Soviet Area, which still has more than ten counties such as Ruijin, the rest that do not count as "Soviet Areas" can almost be said to be nothing. Take Shanghai, where they concentrate all their efforts, for example. Shanghai is the so-called "capital of the proletariat," but what about the communist organization? We know that there are very few true branches that have regular meetings. The main mass organization of the Communist Party, the Red Trade Union, except for those workers who did not come out of the factory, who are running around there, there is not a single healthy branch or group in any industry. As for other cultural groups such as the Mutual Aid Association, the Anti-Imperialist League, and the Anti-Left Alliance, they are just some empty signs, and some even have no signs. Before I was arrested, I had already had the intention of repenting. Now I have repeatedly considered and completely admitted that I took the wrong path, which has further strengthened my determination. I still return to the banner of the Three Principles of the People, which is in line with China's national conditions. From now on, I will fight for the Chinese nation and the Three Principles of the People with the last drop of my blood. Finally, I hope that people in the Communist Party who have a similar political process to me will humbly savor your mistakes and return to the Three Principles of the People. All Communist Party members and those who sympathize with communism, you must quickly shatter your dreams and fantasies, and fight for the Three Principles of the People together.</p>

<h3>The Changning and Zhenning Gunboats to be Launched on the First of Next Month, and Will Raise Flags and Join the Team Together with the Chongyi and Yining Gunboats</h3>
<p>The Naval Department, in order to strengthen its maritime defense capabilities, has proposed to build ten Ning-class coastal defense gunboats. After the Jiangnan Shipyard started construction of these gunboats, the ones that have been launched one after another include Jiangning, Haining, Funing, Suining, Weining, Suning, Chongning, and Yining, eight in total. The ones that have already raised flags and been incorporated into the team are Jiangning and six other ships. Chongning and Yining, although they have been dispatched for use, have not raised flags and been incorporated into the team. It is now learned that the Naval Department has decided to raise the flags and join the team when the Changning and Zhenning gunboats are launched on the first of next month. Chongning and Yining, which are stationed in the capital, will soon be transferred to Shanghai. However, according to the person in charge of the Naval Department, although these ten gunboats are said to be for coastal defense, in fact, these warships cannot sail far from the coast due to the limited amount of coal they can carry. Therefore, after all ten gunboats have been incorporated into the team, they will be transferred to patrol and defend along the Yangtze River.</p>
<h3>Chinese-made Cotton Fabric Market Products Sell Well: Poplin, Striped Serge, etc. Sell Well in Season, and Customers from Various Places are Very Enthusiastic to Purchase Goods</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the Chinese-made cotton fabric market on Tianjin Road in Shanghai, business has developed rapidly. Customers from Shanghai and other places believe that the products in the market are excellent and the prices are low, and there is no need to worry about being deceived. Now that it is summer, it is the time when poplin, bleached striped serge, and other goods are selling well. It is heard that the market has ordered a large number of goods from basic machine households in advance to meet the needs. The market's management and design for basic machine households are very meticulous, so the fabric blanks produced are strong and tidy, and the prices are particularly low. Therefore, customers from various places are very enthusiastic to purchase them. At a time when foreign goods are being dumped and the Chinese fabric industry is declining, the market is working hard to promote Chinese thread and Chinese fabric with concrete plans, and the Chinese people express their deep sympathy.</p>
<h3>A Subletterlord Threatens a Tenant with a Gun: Zhu Xifan is Too Ignorant to Use a Gun Indiscriminately, and Liu Handa Randomly Sounds the Siren, Which Hinders Public Security</h3>
<p>Zhu Xifan, a native of Suzhou who works in a bank, lives at No. 43 Heng'anfang, Zhaozhou Road, Huajie, Nanyang Bridge. He works as a subletterlord. Liu Handa (29 years old), a native of Jiangyin, works as an advertising salesperson for Damaimei Chinese Evening News, and is Zhu's third tenant, living upstairs in the house. At 1:15 a.m. yesterday morning, when Liu returned home, because the light at the staircase was out, he asked Zhu's wife, Chen, to change the light bulb. He did not know how, but a quarrel occurred. When Zhu returned home, Liu negotiated with him, but this caused another conflict. Zhu became angry for a moment and drew his self-defense pistol to demonstrate. Liu then sounded the siren wildly, which was heard by Sun Yi, the No. 3 guard of the Second District General Office, who mistakenly thought it was a theft alarm. He bravely entered the house and learned the truth. He then took Zhu, Liu, Zhu's wife, Chen, and five other witnesses, along with Zhu's pistol and five bullets, to the district. After District Chief Li interrogated them, both parties had their own statements. District Chief Li ordered them to prepare documents and submit them to the Judicial Section of the General Bureau for review.</p>
<h3>Lizardfish Arrived in Song Yesterday: Ocean Trawling is Prosperous, Two Ships Caught 7,000 Fish</h3>
<p>Two fishing boats carrying Lizardfish from the North Ocean arrived in Wusong yesterday. The head boat is named Jinchangshun and is sold by the Cuisheng Fish Company. The second boat is named Zhuchangxing and is sold by the Baofeng Fish Company. The price is $19 per foreign fish. The two boats caught a total of 7,000 Lizardfish, so they were sold out immediately when they were opened for sale. Because these Lizardfish are white in color and taste fresh, the sales in the interior, such as Suzhou, Wuxi, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Linping, are the largest. Therefore, fish merchants from each of these places have sent buyers to be stationed in Song in advance. Yesterday, they were shipped separately to the market for sale. However, according to the crew of the fishing boats, there are many fishing boats on the ocean this year, and the trawling is very prosperous. A large number of Lizardfish boats will be imported in the coming days.</p>

<h3>Litigation Involving Jian Zhaonan's Wife and Daughter - Daughter Named Zhenyi is a Student at St. Mary's Hall - Recent Discord Between Mother and Daughter Leads to Lawsuit - Many Scandalous Family Matters Revealed in Court!</h3>
<p>The late Jian Zhaonan, founder of the Nanyang Tobacco Company, had a daughter named Zhenyi. She was only eight years old when her father passed away, and was raised by Jian's second wife, Liang Jingfang. Later, when Jian's children divided the inheritance, the educational funds and other monies allocated to Zhenyi were also managed by Liang Jingfang on her behalf. Initially, teachers were hired for private tutoring at home. In recent years, she began to attend school externally, boarding at St. Mary's Hall. Although she was not Liang's biological daughter, their relationship was once very sincere. Unexpectedly, in recent years, as the daughter gradually became more worldly-wise, she developed</p>
<h3>Dissatisfaction with Her Mother's Actions</h3>
<p>She often offered earnest advice, but Liang not only failed to heed it but repeatedly tried to lead her daughter astray. This led to great discord between mother and daughter. Recently, the daughter learned that her mother was interfering with her academic plans, so she preemptively engaged lawyer Fang Jifan to send a letter to Jian Liang Jingfang, making several demands. Besides rejecting these demands, Jian Liang immediately hired lawyer He Shimmei to file a petition with the First Special District District Court, claiming that Zhenyi was not Jian Zhaonan's biological daughter but had been adopted at a young age, and requesting permission to</p>
<h3>Terminate the Adoption</h3>
<p>And sever all ties. Upon receiving the petition, the court, noting that Jian Zhenyi had not yet reached adulthood and thus lacked the legal capacity to litigate, decided that she should be given legal aid since she was being sued. The court appointed lawyer Jiang Yiping as the special agent for the defendant, in order to protect her legal rights. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Peng Shi presided over the trial. Both lawyers and the defendant were present, but the plaintiff, Jian Liang Jingfang, claimed to be ill and did not attend. Lawyer Jiang expressed regret that the plaintiff, as the defendant's mother, was unable to attend. He had hoped that a meeting between mother and daughter might lead to mutual understanding and a</p>
<h3>Peaceful Resolution</h3>
<p>However, the plaintiff claimed illness. Lawyer He immediately stated that the plaintiff had originally hoped the defendant would return home, but since the defendant was unwilling to listen and had given up on reconciliation, the plaintiff had no choice but to file the lawsuit. Lawyer Jiang then briefly described the reasons for Jian Zhenyi's departure from the family, saying that Jian Liang Jingfang had allowed someone with no familial ties to the Jians to live in the house, and that this person had repeatedly made inappropriate advances towards Jian Zhenyi. Zhenyi repeatedly advised the plaintiff, but was not heeded. Fearing the adverse influence of prolonged contact, she resolutely</p>
<h3>Left the Family</h3>
<p>And asked a lawyer to send a letter to her mother. Fortunately, Zhenyi had received a good education and did not follow her mother's misguided orders, remaining unsullied by the muck. If the court wished to understand the defendant's grievances, the true situation could be fully known when the plaintiff appeared in court for cross-examination. Judge Peng then questioned the defendant, Jian Zhenyi. According to her testimony, she studied at home from a young age. By the age of twelve, she had completed the Four Books and Five Classics. She is currently boarding at St. Mary's Hall. Her tuition, boarding fees, and clothing are all provided by the plaintiff. When her father was alive, he treated me very well. After my father passed away at the age of eight, the plaintiff</p>
<h3>Became Involved With a Monk</h3>
<p>And treated me increasingly poorly. That monk repeatedly tried to make inappropriate advances. The plaintiff, seeing that I was not seduced by the monk, treated me with increasing discrimination. That monk, because my grandmother worshipped Buddha, had invited monks from Nanjing's Baohua Mountain to our home in Hong Kong to chant sutras. Among them was a monk with the Dharma name Benji, whom the plaintiff favored. She ordered him to stay in the room next to the plaintiff's bedroom upstairs, while all the other monks were housed downstairs. Every time I bathed, that monk would barge in. And when he bathed, he would</p>
<h3>Force Me into the Room</h3>
<p>When I slept, that monk would put his hand into my blankets. Such rudeness was truly unbearable. At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer, hearing Zhenyi's words implicate Benji, immediately stood up to rebut them, saying that Benji was a high-ranking monk from Baohua Mountain, second only to the abbot in rank. He had a close relationship with Jian Zhaonan and Jian Yujie, as well as Wang Yiting and Wen Lanting, all prominent figures in Shanghai. Furthermore, the current Chairman of the National Government, Lin Sen, and the President of the Examination Yuan, Dai Jitao,</p>
<h3>Often Interacted with Him</h3>
<p>His character and position in Buddhism are self-evident. Huang Zonghan, wife of Mr. Huang Keqiang, who is in the audience, and the female teachers who taught the defendant in the past, all know the monk's character and can be asked about it. Thereupon, Mrs. Huang and others came forward to testify. However, the defendant Jian Zhenyi, after the testimonies of the two witnesses, continued to state that the plaintiff was having an affair with the monk, and that many members of the family were aware of it. This time, I heard Benji discussing with my mother in the room, saying that I was disobedient to my elders and should no longer be allowed to study, but should be married off at will. Therefore, feeling that this would be detrimental to me in the future, I left home and asked lawyer Fang to send a letter to the plaintiff, etc. At this point in the trial, the judge adjourned the hearing to the afternoon of the 25th for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Forcing His Widowed Sister-in-Law to Live With Him - He Actually Attacked Her With a Knife - Sister-in-Law Resisted to the Death, Enraging Him to Chop With the Knife - Shen Jiabing's Absurd Behavior</h3>
<p>Shen Yu, a woman from Suqian, Jiangsu, was married to Shen through a matchmaker. They had three children and lived together at No. 151 Yichang Road, West Shanghai. Last year, Shen suddenly fell ill and died. In order to make a living, Shen Yu took her eldest daughter (fourteen years old) to work in a nearby factory to support her children, living a hard life in peace. Unexpectedly, her husband's elder brother, Shen Jiabing, who lived in Nanshi and worked as a vendor, was over forty years old and still unmarried. Since his brother's death, he had repeatedly sought to take advantage of his widowed sister-in-law, intending to make her his own. Yu sternly refused. Around 6:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, Shen Jiabing, carrying a kitchen knife, went to Shen Yu's house and stated that he had already rented a house and that she could quickly move in with him. Yu still refused. Shen then used violent means to drag her outside. Yu resisted to the death. Shen, feeling ashamed and enraged, pulled out the kitchen knife and chopped at her twice, causing knife wounds to her head and arms. Then, her relative Zhang Xiulou stepped forward to dissuade him and was also injured in the hand by the knife. Patrolman Ma Jinbiao and Chinese constable No. 2194 heard the commotion and arrived at the scene. They helped to take Shen Jiabing, along with the murder weapon, to the Putuo Road police station for detention. Meanwhile, the injured woman was taken to Guangren Hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, Shen was sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Gan Jingxian charged Shen Jiabing with assault under Article 294 of the Criminal Code, stating that apart from Zhang Xiulou, who was present, Shen Yu was still being treated in the hospital due to her injuries, and requested that the hearing be postponed. He then presented the kitchen knife as evidence. Judge Wu Tingqi briefly questioned Zhang Xiulou and the defendant and ordered Shen to be detained pending a further hearing.</p>
<h3>Olympia Grand Theater Suddenly Collapses Yesterday Morning - Extends to the Market Houses Behind the Theater, Fortunately No One Injured - Public Security Bureau Will Order Complete Demolition and Reconstruction</h3>
<p>At 9:30 a.m. yesterday, the Olympia Grand Theater on Robison Road, Caojiadu, suddenly collapsed, causing extensive damage to the interior structure and affecting the houses in Gongyi Lane behind the theater. Fortunately, no one was injured. Afterwards, the relevant Public Security Bureau and Fire Brigade sent personnel to inspect the site and concluded that the theater's construction was substandard and needed to be rebuilt. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Repair Work</h3>
<p>The Olympia Grand Theater, located at the intersection of Robison Road and Jessfield Road, was built eight years ago. The building itself was not very old, but while the exterior front wall was made of reinforced concrete, the construction of the rear and interior was poor. The roof was made of thin foreign pine planks coated with a minimal amount of lime. The joints were made of foreign pine wood and were not very sturdy. Four days ago, during a performance at the theater, people inside suddenly noticed that the roof was shaking slightly and was in a precarious state. The theater immediately suspended performances and began repairs, intending to reinforce the roof slightly before resuming performances.</p>
<h3>Sudden Collapse Yesterday</h3>
<p>Although the theater was under repair, only a portion was being repaired, while the rest remained unrepaired. In fact, the remaining parts were so dilapidated that they could not support the structure. As a result, at 9:30 a.m. yesterday, with a loud crash, the interior roof and other parts collapsed. The broken brick walls fell into Gongyi Lane behind the theater. Zhu Xingbao, a resident of No. 2 Gongyi Lane, happened to be there at the time, and his house was crushed, with only the lower part remaining. The residents of the lane were greatly alarmed. Fortunately, the Zhu family members were all out buying groceries in the morning and had not returned home, so they escaped the disaster. The workers at the theater all worked at night, and were not present at the time of the collapse, so no lives were lost, which can be considered fortunate.</p>
<h3>Post-Accident Investigation</h3>
<p>After the accident, the relevant Sixth District Public Security Bureau, the Caojiadu Fire Brigade, and the Zhabei Fire Brigade went to investigate the cause of the collapse. It was found that the construction was too poor and that the theater's water</p>
<p>The structure was incomplete, allowing moisture to seep into the foreign pine wood at the joints on both sides of the roof, causing it to gradually rot. As a result, the roof lost its supporting force and collapsed. It was also observed that the rear wall of the theater was leaning severely and was also in danger of collapsing. Therefore, the Public Security Bureau plans to order the theater to be demolished and rebuilt as soon as possible. Otherwise, its license will be revoked.</p>
<h3>Rogue Li Zhiming Conspires With Others - Midnight Ax Murder - Yao Minggao and Wife, One Dead and One Seriously Injured</h3>
<p>Yao Minggao, a 47-year-old farmer from Gaogang Lane No. 39, Zhoujiaqiao, Caojiadu, West Shanghai, and his wife, Zhou, had three sons. The eldest son, Wensheng, was a fishmonger and was married to Axiang. The second son was Linggen, and the youngest child was Xiao Anan. Li Zhiming, a 23-year-old local rogue who lived in the same house, specialized in opening gambling dens. Recently, he planned to sell the mud from his property's foundation to the Yipin Kiln, calculating the price at one yuan per square meter. He asked Yao Minggao and others to act as intermediaries, but Yao's son Wensheng and his wife had a poor relationship with Li Zhiming, and were unwilling to act as intermediaries, so the deal fell through. Li harbored resentment and plotted revenge. He secretly conspired with several rogue accomplices to falsely accuse Wensheng of being a major offender in gambling dens. Four days ago, he secretly reported to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, accusing Wensheng of being a gambling offender. Police detectives arrested Yao Wensheng and sent him to the Third Division of the General Bureau for detention, where the case is currently under investigation. Li Zhiming, still unsatisfied, planned to target Yao's wife, Axiang. The night before last, he gathered more than ten rogues, each carrying two sharp axes and kitchen knives, and hid. He went to the Li family to play mahjong in shifts. At about 1:00 a.m. yesterday, Li ordered his accomplices to follow him, taking the lead with a weapon in hand. He broke down the door, intending to kill Axiang. Yao and his wife were awakened from their dreams and got up to investigate. They saw Li Zhiming and more than ten others, each holding a weapon, with ferocious expressions. Zhou, seeing this, screamed for help and grabbed Li Zhiming. Li immediately used a sharp axe to chop Yao Zhou's head, throat, and feet, hitting vital spots. She died instantly, lying in a pool of blood. Yao Minggao was chopped more than twenty times on the head, back of the head, temples, waist, and body, with blood flowing freely. He fell to the ground groaning, on the verge of death. Seeing that they had caused a disaster, the assailants stopped trying to kill Axiang, abandoned their weapons, and fled, taking Li's wife with them. At that time, Yao Axiang heard the commotion and hid with her baby under the bed. Only after the assailants left and dawn broke did she see her parents-in-law, one dead and one injured, lying in a pool of blood. She immediately rushed to the Zhoujiaqiao branch of the Sixth District Public Security Bureau to report the details of the tragedy to the patrol officer. The officer relayed the report to the district chief, who ordered Detective Squad Leader Wu Kezhong to go to the scene with the police chief to investigate. Two sharp axes, two pointed knives, and a kitchen knife were seized and brought to the district for evidence. The critically injured Yao Minggao was rushed to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road for treatment, but his life was in danger. At the same time, the local guarantor was asked to request the local court to inspect the body and report to the General Bureau, ordering all districts to issue arrest warrants for the fleeing criminals and bring them to justice.</p>
<h3>Dealers of Mechanical Ice Sales - Yesterday Petitioned the Municipal Party Headquarters - Requesting Permission to Organize a Trade Union</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the dispute between the city's mechanical ice dealers and the Xiesheng Company over monopolizing the market has lasted for more than a month without resolution. Recently, it was discovered that Xiesheng Company subsidized Guangyi with 5,280 yuan and Qialong with 10,000 yuan to persuade them to stop operations. Yesterday, dealers specially sent representatives Qiu Haitao, Pan Zhiliang, Qin Xin, and three others with a document petitioning the Municipal Party Headquarters, requesting (1) a scheduled mediation, (2) an explicit order for Guangyi and Qialong to open factories, and (3) permission to establish a trade union. The petition was received by Wang Yucheng, a cadre from the Civil Movement Section, who promised to investigate and handle it.</p>

<h3>The Public Works Department's Health Office - Explanation of Well Water</h3>
<p>In order to protect people who use well water, the Public Works Department has decided that from June 1, all well openers must comply with the published regulations and obtain a license. (Recently, the Health Office has made another statement on whether well water is applicable. The general idea is that if it is for drinking, there must be no risk of bacterial change, and there must be no excessive amount of mixed matter and unsealed matter, so that it can also be convenient for washing. In terms of bacteria, the deep water source is generally pure. If the structure of the well is proper, the preservation and transportation are also perfect, and external infections can be avoided. As for the chemical properties of well water, because it comes from different layers, there are great differences. Even at the same depth, but the location is different, there are also great differences. The difference in water properties can be discussed from the following points: (1) Mixed substances. Suitable water must be free of fine sand, soil, and iron compounds. If the well body is properly and durably covered, the water source can be expected to be free of such substances. (2) Mineral Solubility. The less dissolved minerals in the water, the better. Well water usually contains more than surface water, or even too much. If it contains no more than eighty parts per ten thousand, it can be suitable for household use, but at the same time, it must not be too hard and must contain less salt. (3) Water Hardness. Water that is too hard costs a lot of soap for washing, and it also forms a lot of crust. The harder ones are mostly due to containing green calcium and green magnesium, which taste slightly bitter. Long-term drinking may cause gastrointestinal diseases. The standard of hardness is roughly twenty-one Crains per gallon. If it exceeds this, it is also inconvenient for washing. (4) Iron Content. Well water may contain a lot of iron, especially hard water. Most of the iron is dissolved. It may be very clear when first drawn, but when exposed to air, it will appear yellow or rusty. As for its standard, it should not exceed five parts per ten million. (5) Salt Content Standard. Water containing salt up to fifty parts per ten thousand has a slight taste. Beyond this level, it may not necessarily be a health hazard, but it is not suitable for drinking. In short, the depth of the well must be three hundred feet or up to eight hundred feet, and the water must be tested by a competent agency and pass the test before it can be used for household use.</p>
<h3>Memorial of the Famous Painter Gao Qifeng, Half a Year After Death</h3>
<p>Mr. Gao Qifeng, with his articles and morality, was renowned throughout the world. His profound aesthetics and the greatness of his aspirations shone like the sun and the moon, surpassing the past and present. On November 2nd last year, he passed away in Shanghai from illness. The grief of Chinese and foreign people has been reported in the previous reports. The second of this month is the six-month memorial of his death. Ms. Kunyi, feeling grateful for her education and upbringing, was deeply saddened. A memorial service was specially held at Yinyangying in Nanjing. Many relatives and friends from all walks of life attended the ceremony. Recalling the art sect, they all shed tears of sadness. Many of the memorial texts and elegies on that day are selected below: The National Government's Sacrifice to Mr. Gao Qifeng's text says, "Oh, Mr. Gao, the essence of the art garden, waving the sun and the moon, and the air walks the thunder. Young and brilliant, long and mature, looking down on Yuexiu, and responding to Wenxing. Wherever the brush reaches, it is full of praise in hundreds of cities. He assisted in the revolution and did not want or demand anything. His walls were sparse, and he was unique. The landscape is in the painting, and the sky wind is in the building. In this small scale, there will be thousands of years in the future. Speaking of his aspirations and actions, he is a teacher of human relations. Feng Huan burned his bonds, and Lin Bu was a poet. The gains from the rest of his life were blessed by his relatives and friends. His clear mark is bright and his festival is of pine and frost. He once traveled in foreign lands, and the scholars and women competed for"</p>
<h3>Mr. Gao Qifeng's Posthumous Portrait</h3>
<p>Behold, with a bushy beard and emerald eyes, paying respects in dignified attire, encompassing both Chinese and Western styles, creating a magnificent spectacle. His exceptional skill in painting was astounding to all who saw it, affirming his unwavering integrity. He bloomed late in life, a towering mountain to be revered, a convergence of all rivers flowing to the sea. His footsteps were firm, his vision clear. Both Europe and Asia honored this gifted individual. Alas, unexpectedly, we have lost this master craftsman prematurely. The year of the Golden Rooster marks the destruction of a jade tree by a fierce wind. Scholars and artists alike mourn his passing, fearing the decline of the fine arts. Fragments of silk and paper are transformed into a rainbow spanning the heavens. Alas, our country is afflicted, and the government cherishes his memory. Recalling his esteemed virtue, a century of nurturing talent. Fresh grass is offered as a sacrifice, and spring flowers adorn the mat. May his soul return, his beautiful legacy enduring forever. Alas, may he rest in peace.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the mourning address by Ms. Kunyi states: On the second day of the fifth month of the twenty-third year of the Republic of China, Kunyi, your adopted daughter who has received your teachings, respectfully offers incense and tears as a sacrifice to your sacred spirit, lamenting the passing of my revered teacher, Mr. Qifeng, for six long months. Alas, the earth is dense, the air vast. The swirling winds and falling leaves cause much sorrow. Since ancient times, all have known regret, but this regret is boundless. I offer tears as pure wine, kneeling to present these sorrowful words. May your spirit be present, witnessing this grief. Recalling my younger years, painting was your passion, your talent unmatched. You astonished my kind mother, who invited you with courtesy. You became my excellent teacher, instructing me diligently. For four years, you deemed me capable of learning, teaching me in detail. Alas, like an orphan losing its mother, I mourn the passing of a virtuous woman. You took in the orphaned Zhang Kan, entrusting her to Long Shu. You nourished and taught me, scolding and encouraging me. For eleven years, it was as if it happened yesterday. Fulfilling your destiny, you continued your lineage, showing me boundless affection. You nurtured me first, praising my promising talent. You urged me to be diligent, forgiving my stubbornness. You sheltered and raised me, helping me climb the ladder. You guided and supported me, helping me ascend the foundation. I naively believed that this untamed child could be cultivated. How could it be that such a blessing was not granted, and the support of a father has collapsed?</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>The three luminaries have lost their brilliance, and the nine realms are in darkness. Alas, how painful! You were born in the late Qing dynasty, enduring the oppressive regime. You followed the Premier, striving for revolution. After the establishment of the Republic of China, you did not seek recognition for your achievements but supported yourself through painting, benefiting many scholars. You were gentle, kind, respectful, frugal, loving, and selfless, never seeking official position, upholding integrity. For the sake of the Party and the country, you exhausted yourself and forgot your weariness. Knowing your illness was incurable, you quickly drafted your will, entrusting your family and possessions to the nation, hoping that your virtue would not be forgotten. Your art will be passed on to all nations, promoting our national glory. You burned bonds and forgave debts, surpassing the righteousness of Lord Mengchang. Alas, such noble integrity and lofty character are rare in both ancient and modern times. People are still grateful and tearful, yet why did Heaven deny you this? I lament your holiness in life and grieve your passing. We grieve together for the sake of art, mourning the lack of help in times of need. May your spirit and the green lotus flowers join hands in the clouds, recognizing the perils of the world, feeling pain and anguish. I will never forget the hardships and unwavering resolve of the past, the sacrifices and compromises. With a heart full of worries, you still devoted yourself to painting, advocating art education, teaching tirelessly. In addition to the Six Canons of Painting, you also imparted the power of inspiration and comparison. You comforted life with truth, goodness, and beauty. Your three thousand disciples have all been blessed by your teachings. There is no way to repay your kindness; the pain is eternal. Day and night, we encourage each other, sharing our hearts and minds. But alas, cruel Heaven has taken away our good teacher. Morning and evening, we follow your footsteps; our resolve will not change. We are filled with remorse, and our breath is weakening. We will continue your aspirations and transmit your virtues, even if it means dying nine times. Alas, the heavenly wind has passed. I cannot bear to recite the teachings. Though alive, I feel as if I am dead. I wish to knock on the heavy door. Your spirit has not yet fulfilled its purpose, and your eyes must not close. May your supreme virtue be eternally fragrant. Alas, may you rest in peace.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Mr. Yu Youren's eulogy reads: An extraordinary man embodies truth, his spirit molded by ten thousand forms. The greatest voice is the faintest sound. He embodied the written word in painting, transcending the visible, grasping its essence. He received from society and returned to society, using art as a means for revolution. His integrity shone brightly. May the Tower of Heavenly Wind stand forever, its fragrance reaching the world.</p>
<h3>Shareholders' Meeting of the Taishan Insurance Company: Chairman Xu Xinliu's Report</h3>
<p>The Taishan Insurance Company, located at 2 Beijing Road, is one of the larger Chinese-owned insurance companies. It engages in fire, marine, life, and accident insurance. It has been in operation for less than a year and a half, but due to the rich knowledge and experience of its executives and its cautious underwriting practices, its business is flourishing. Yesterday, the company convened its second annual shareholders' meeting on the second floor of 2 Beijing Road. The shareholders present represented more than 80,000 shares. Chairman Xu Xinliu reported on various accounts and the business situation, and resolutions were passed. The directors and supervisors were elected, including Xu Xinliu, Li Fusun, Liu Hongsheng, Wang Qizi, Li Shuxiong, Pan Xuean, Sun Zhongli, Hu Mengjia, Chen Qijun, Tang Shishu, Shi Peiren, Shi Dan, Xu Jilun, Takesen Sei, and Chen Pin Chen, who were elected as directors. Shen Shuyu, Gu Zhanran, and Mr. Smith were elected as supervisors. The chairman of the company, Xu Xinliu, gave a detailed report. His speech is recorded in detail below:</p>
<p>Esteemed shareholders, we are now holding the second annual shareholders' meeting of our company. I am very pleased to have you all in attendance. The company's account summary and business report have already been sent to you for your review. I will now briefly summarize the key points. I hope you will not find my repetition tiresome. Our company began operations on September 21, 1932, and by the end of 1933, only fifteen months had passed. Yet, this is already the second report. During this second year, three-quarters of the business was newly acquired. If you carefully review the account summary, you will see that the achievements of our company, compared to other companies founded around the same time, are quite satisfactory. Looking back, the Sino-Japanese problem was still unresolved last year, the Communist banditry continued unabated, and the Fujian Incident suddenly broke out. In addition, the global economic panic deeply affected our country. All industries were significantly impacted, and the insurance business was, of course, no exception. However, in this difficult and challenging environment, our company still managed to generate a gross revenue of 538,942.46 yuan, and the proportion of indemnity payments was not large. Therefore, after setting aside the reserve fund, we still had a net profit of 73,946.53 yuan, which is also satisfactory. This year, our company strived for sound organization. Internally, we employed personnel with rich academic knowledge and experience. For the insurance we underwrite, we knew what to select and how to make decisions. In various regions, we increased the number of branches and agencies, so that insurance premiums came in steadily and the risks we insured were dispersed in various locations, making the business more stable. Our company already has branches or agencies in many locations in North China, Central China, South China, and Hong Kong. This year, we plan to continue to expand, with the goal of widespread coverage. Due to intense competition among Chinese and foreign companies in the fire insurance business, the actual insurance fees collected were very low. However, our company does not engage in indiscriminate underwriting, but adheres to the principle of prudence, only underwriting profitable risks. Last year, the total income from fire insurance premiums was 253,695.53 yuan. After deducting reinsurance premiums, the actual income was 143,393.03 yuan. The proportion of indemnity payments to premiums earned was 62.5%. The commission paid was only 16.1%. Therefore, the fire insurance business still had a slight profit. However, if the industry does not work together to correct the unhealthy competition in the fire insurance business, our company will have no choice but to adopt the strategy of low fees and cautious underwriting. Fortunately, our company does not place too much emphasis on fire insurance. Currently, we only need to underwrite a reasonable amount, and then plan for development after the environment improves. Marine insurance is currently focused on foreign shipping cargo. Although there are few companies underwriting marine insurance along the coast of our country, the competition is fierce. Although insurance prices are low, the risks are very high. Therefore, there are few insurance companies that can still have a surplus after paying indemnity payments. As for hull insurance business, given the current market situation, prudent insurance companies do not intend to compete for it. Our company's total income from marine insurance premiums was 59,652.14 yuan. The proportion of indemnity payments to premiums was 52.6%. Our company's accident insurance business is jointly operated with two other major insurance companies in this city. This not only increases our company's premium income, but also increases our experience in handling this type of insurance. Because personal accident insurance is still in the testing phase in our country, joint operation is more appropriate. The total income from premiums was 31,629.63 yuan, which is a satisfactory achievement. However, we urgently need to find a way to promote the value of this type of insurance, so that people in society generally understand the need for this type of insurance. The premium income from automobile insurance was 81,440.15 yuan. The indemnity rate was 54.8%. However, price competition is becoming increasingly fierce. If measures are not taken to remedy this situation, the automobile insurance market will also be ruined. Our company's life insurance department has achieved excellent results. By the end of 1933, the effective insurance coverage had reached 1,998,613 yuan, while the total amount at the end of 1932 was only 514,000 yuan. According to insurance conventions, newly established companies initially incur large expenses for commissions, medical examination fees, etc. The increase in effective insurance coverage actually reduces life insurance funds. However, our company's life insurance department has been able to reduce expenses. Life insurance funds in 1933 increased from 2,900.03 yuan to 23,431.92 yuan. Our company's fire insurance department, marine insurance department, and accident insurance department have set aside sufficient reserves by the end of December 31, 1933, totaling 114,359.38 yuan. The life insurance fund is 23,431.82 yuan, which is also sufficient to meet existing liabilities. Even if we calculate according to the statutory reserve standard of the most stable old companies in the United States, using a 3.5% interest rate, we only need to add 5,000 yuan. Now, the board of directors proposes to set aside additional life insurance funds from the surplus, so that our company's insurance policies have higher cash value and the insurance premiums are lower, making it easier for managers to attract customers and compete reasonably with other companies. The profit and loss account showed a net profit of 73,946.53 yuan at the end of 1933. The decoration of real estate has been depreciated by 20%, and stationery and other items have been fully charged to expenses. As for the company's various investments, the appreciation of 14,859.63 yuan, calculated at the market price at the end of the year, was not included, but was fully transferred to the investment depreciation reserve. What we hope is that the net profit in 1934 will be greater than this year's, because the amount of reserve funds retained at the end of this year will be large, and most of the reserve funds for the next year do not need to be allocated from the income. The cash and current and fixed deposits in the bank on the balance sheet are a large amount, because proper investments are extremely difficult to find. The company's investment committee is not easy to use funds. However, in this difficult situation, the interest received this year is still not bad, and the activity of the company's funds is indeed sufficient to reassure the shareholders. I know that all shareholders are eager for the company's foundation to be consolidated and become a strong insurance company in the country. Therefore, the hope of everyone present should not be satisfied with obtaining dividends, but must make this company as solid as a rock, and its reputation known throughout the country, fulfilling its natural duty to serve society. You all share in this glory. For this reason, the board of directors recommends that 20,000 yuan be allocated from the surplus for life insurance funds, 40,000 yuan for public reserve funds, and the remaining 13,946.53 yuan be carried forward to the next year. I hope this will be adopted. Now, on behalf of the board of directors, I would like to report to you that the company's employees and agents have worked hard, diligently, and loyally in their duties. We should express our gratitude to them. If we continue to work hard, Taishan Company will surely make significant progress in 1934. I can tell you in advance that the business results for the past four months have already proven that this is not an empty promise.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the esteemed Editor,</p>
<p>I am writing to you regarding the report in today's local news section of your newspaper concerning the case of Fang Zhengzhi and his daughter Ruyu suing Tang Liuru for seducing a Min woman in the First Special Court. The report refers to Tang as "the small master of our pawnshop," which is not in accordance with the facts. After investigation, Tang is one of the staff members of our pawnshop, not a small master. Since this concerns the reputation of all shareholders, we must request a correction to clarify the facts. We earnestly request that you investigate and grant a correction. We respectfully wish you good health.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Reading Q&amp;A</p>
<h3>Discussion on Several Basic Philosophical Questions (II)</h3>
<p>(Yesterday, we roughly discussed the content of the second question, "Identity," raised by Mr. Sheng Jifu. Today, we will continue to explain the content of "Unity." - Editor)</p>
<p>The English term for "unity" is Unity, which is opposed to the abstract identity mentioned earlier. However, it also contains the meaning of identity. However, the unity here is a concrete identity: what is called concrete identity? That is to say, this identity contains elements of difference, contradiction, movement, change, etc. For example, "Resistance to Japan" and "Anti-Imperialism" have the same nature, but we cannot ignore the differences, contradictions, movements, and changes within them. Resistance to Japan is resisting the aggression of Japanese imperialism, while anti-imperialism is opposing the aggression of all imperialism. If we think that resistance to Japan is anti-imperialism and ignore the movement of other imperialist powers to divide China, the result will inevitably be to hope to contact other great powers to help China sanction Japan (many people in China have a mentality of relying on the League of Nations, which is based on this kind of mistaken understanding) (of course, there are other reasons). In such a movement, the meaning of resistance to Japan will change. It changes from resisting Japanese aggression against China to welcoming all imperialist powers to jointly manage China. This kind of change is invisible under the recognition of abstract identity. However, under the recognition of concrete unity, it can be reflected in its original form. It gives us many aspects of preparation for the practical action of resisting Japan and anti-imperialism, grasping the possibility of greater victory. Let's take another example. For example, the Russian February Revolution of 1917 was a united front of workers, peasants, and the bourgeoisie who jointly overthrew "Tsarism" (in layman's terms, it can be called Tsarist autocracy) demanding freedom and liberation of various classes of the democratic revolution, but it does not mean that there is no difference or contradiction between them, nor does it mean that the interests of the bourgeoisie are completely equal to the interests of the peasants, and completely equal to the interests of the workers. Of course, the interests of seeking freedom and liberation are the same ((this is the basis for the establishment of a united front), so workers, peasants, and the bourgeoisie all organize the strength of their own class to participate in the revolution, and the differences and contradictions between the various classes are countless. In this revolution, they each strive to obtain great spoils. Workers, peasants, and soldiers demanded the organization of Soviets (meaning representative meetings), while the bourgeoisie demanded a constitutional assembly. Workers, peasants, and soldiers used all their talents to arm themselves and strengthen the strength of their class; the bourgeoisie also demanded to strengthen their own strength; workers, peasants, and soldiers demanded an immediate end to the imperialist war and demanded peace, bread, and freedom; the bourgeoisie wanted to continue to participate in the war against Germany. Workers and peasants wanted to fundamentally overthrow the order of the old society, occupy factories, and confiscate land, which was the opposite of the bourgeoisie. (The minority faction ignored the differences and contradictions between classes and became the tail of the bourgeoisie. The majority faction recognized these, grasped the transformative nature of the revolution, and led the worker-peasant riots.) From these differences and contradictions between classes, it developed into the action of workers, peasants, and soldiers "turning trench warfare into domestic class warfare." Kerensky's bourgeois government soon began to arrest and slaughter workers and peasants. This continued to develop, creating the October Revolution. At this time, it was no longer a united front of the bourgeoisie and workers and peasants, but a division into the latter and the former.</p>
<p>Let's take another very simple example. For example, the state, this is an abstract concept. Whether it is Britain, France, Germany, the United States, the Soviet Union, Afghanistan, Siam, etc., they are all states, and there are various differences between them, such as constitutional monarchy, democratic constitutionalism, fascist dictatorship, and proletarian dictatorship. Comprehensively, there are capitalist states and socialist states. Due to the differences in various political systems, the contradictions and conflicts between them are obvious. The former contradicts the latter, forming a war against the Soviet Union, that is, there are also contradictions between the various countries of the former, forming an inter-imperialist war. For example, taking the warlord wars in China, the warlord wars three years ago and the warlord wars three years later are still the same warlord wars, but there are obvious differences and different depths of contradictions. For example, the Lu-Yu War that broke out due to the temporary government in Peiping raised by Feng and Yan, and the recent Min War, have different meanings. The former still used the Three Principles of the People as a banner, while the latter was actually against the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>In short, in the recognition of the concept and form of things, there is only abstract identity, and abandoning all kinds of colorful, lively, and multifaceted concrete facts (even a trace of a sign) is incorrect, which is philosophical idealism.</p>
<p>In fact, there are no completely equal things in the universe. That is, today's me is not completely equal to yesterday's me, and tomorrow's me is not completely equal to today's and yesterday's me. You are like this, he is like this, everyone is the same. The so-called "unity" is not to abandon and obliterate the "concrete recognition of the division of identity and the parts full of contradictions." This is the essence of dialectics.</p>
<p>From the above explanation, readers can be helped to understand the difference between identity and unity, right? (To be continued)</p>

<p>Shen Bao 10th Far Eastern Games Special Issue No. 6</p>
<h3>Sixth Day of the Far Eastern Games Resolution of the Sino-Philippine Basketball Dispute Overturning the Referee's Decision for a Rematch on the 20th Wu Bixian Fourth in High Jump Liu Changchun Fails to Qualify Our Basketball Team Wins Against Japan Again Our Volleyball Team Loses to Japan Our Women's Swimming Team Triumphs, Completely Defeating the Philippines</h3>
<p>The main program of the sixth day of the Games (the 16th) was track and field and swimming, which were the most disappointing programs for our country. Fortunately, Wu Bixian's high jump unexpectedly gained a harvest, achieving fourth place with a height of 1.879 meters, earning a valuable point. Liu Changchun's 100-meter and 200-meter preliminary races completely failed, which was very disappointing. Our men's swimming team was completely defeated, but the women's team triumphed, winning three championships in a row, completely defeating the Philippines, leaving them in complete disarray. In the second Sino-Japanese basketball game, our team narrowly defeated Japan by a score of 48 to 47, a difference of only one point, which can be described as extremely dangerous. However, in the second volleyball game, our team was defeated by Japan. Where is the prestige of the previous championship? The most heartbreaking and shocking thing is this. The repeated defeat of the baseball team to the Philippines was expected. The dispute in the preliminary Sino-Philippine basketball game, after our country's protest, has been decided by the competition meeting to rule in our country's favor, overturning the referee's decision and scheduling a make-up game on the 20th. Japan's protest against our men's volleyball team was also won by our country. However, our country's appeal against the referee in the women's volleyball game was rejected. In recent days, disputes caused by referees have been frequent, which is really regrettable. The program of today's ball games is very light, and our country only has two volleyball games against the Philippines. The two countries of Japan and the Philippines will begin the tennis finals. Attention is still focused on track and field and swimming, but our country's hopes are very slim.</p>
<h3>Resolution of the Sino-Philippine Basketball Dispute Overturning the Original Decision for a Rematch Failure of China's Protest in the Sino-Philippine Women's Volleyball Game Resolution of the Chen Baoqiu Substitution Case Japan Loses the Case</h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from Manila, this newspaper, 16th) After reading the basketball guidance meeting minutes this morning, Ira Nan, honorary secretary of the Philippine Sports Association, decided to cancel the Sino-Philippine basketball game last night (15th) and reschedule it. The situation of the rain last night and the timer's record of more than twenty minutes of rain all prove that China's protest is reasonable. In the second meeting of the competition committee, the Sino-Philippine rematch was scheduled for the evening of the 20th.</p>
<p>(Manila, 16th) In the Sino-Philippine basketball game, the Chinese team protested that the game could not continue due to the rain and slippery ground, and believed that the referee's announcement of abandonment was unreasonable. Today, the Far Eastern Games Competition Committee held two meetings. There was fierce debate. The first meeting was held at 11:30 AM. The Chinese representatives attended to explain the reasons for the protest. At 1:30 PM, the second meeting was held, and it was decided that the game would be cancelled and a rematch would be held. The Philippine side has agreed to schedule it for the evening of Sunday, the 20th.</p>
<h3>Content of the Guidance Meeting Resolution</h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from Manila, this newspaper, 16th) The entire record of the basketball guidance meeting at 6:00 PM on the 8th has been obtained in full by our country's guidance Dong Shouyi. The content is as follows: The game may be temporarily suspended due to rain. If the rain does not stop after twenty minutes, the game must be rescheduled. The time and place will be decided after agreement between the two captains. This record is signed by Ira Nan, honorary secretary of the Philippine Sports Association.</p>
<h3>Overturning the 2-0 Forfeiture Case</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Manila, 16th) In the Sino-Philippine basketball game on the afternoon of the 15th, our side requested a stop due to the rain, but the referee refused and ruled that our side had forfeited, losing 2-0. On the morning of the 16th, our head coach Ma Yuehan and basketball coach Dong Shouyi, based on the resolution of the basketball committee on the 9th, made representations to Elanuo, chairman of the competition committee. Elanuo allowed the game on the 15th to be invalidated and rescheduled. However, due to the unfairness of the referees in recent days and Li Zhenzhong's arm injury, it may be difficult to play, so in the future rematch, there will be more misfortune than good fortune, and victory cannot be guaranteed.</p>
<h3>Failure of Women's Volleyball Protest</h3>
<p>(Manila, 16th) In the second meeting of the Far Eastern Games Competition Committee today, the protest of the Chinese women's volleyball team was decided to be rejected. At the same time, the victory of the Philippine women was confirmed. (Via special dispatch from Manila, 16th) The Chinese women's volleyball team lost to the Philippines twice. The unfairness of the referees is the reason for this. Today, China has protested to the competition committee. The Manila Daily Bulletin, run by an American in Manila, proved that Shen Guo's protest was very reasonable when reporting the news of this game.</p>
<h3>Japan Loses Chen Baoqiu Case</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Manila, 16th) In the Sino-Japanese volleyball game on the 13th, we defeated Japan 3-2. In the fourth set, we replaced Tan Yongzhan with Chen Baoqiu to play. Unexpectedly, the Japanese side protested that Chen Baoqiu was not a volleyball player. However, Chen Baoqiu had already registered with the competition committee when he arrived in the Philippines. The Japanese protest was unreasonable. On the 16th, the competition committee ruled that Japan lost the case.</p>
<p>(United China News Agency, Tokyo, 16th) According to the Dong Bao, it is said that in Manila, the case of the Japanese side accusing the Chinese volleyball team of changing players without authorization was resolved today after comparing the photos taken by the conference at the time, confirming that the Japanese side had made a mistake and caused an unnecessary dispute. The Japanese side admitted their mistake and apologized today, settling the matter.</p>
<h3>Our Country's Women's Swimming Team - Yang Xiuqiong, Liang Yongxian, Chen Huanqiong, Liu Guizhen, Achieve Remarkable Results</h3>
<h3>Women's Swimming Team Triumphs Yang Xiuqiong Shocks the Philippines</h3>
<p>Our country's women almost monopolize swimming</p>
<p>Mermaid sets new 50-meter record</p>
<h3>Defeating the Philippines' Boring Criticism</h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from Manila, this newspaper, 16th) The Filipinos have made unwarranted criticisms of our country, saying that our country's female athletes came to compete for beauty, not to participate in sports competitions. This boring criticism has been defeated today. Our country's female swimmer Yang Xiuqiong won the women's 50-meter freestyle swimming championship with a record of 36.9 seconds. Yang was the last person to fall into the water at the starting point, but her victory was far ahead of the second place. Philippine Losita was second, and our country's Liu Guizhen was third.</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from Manila, this newspaper, 16th) In the women's 200-meter breaststroke final, Ms. Yang Xiuqiong won first place, a difference of 20 meters, but was disqualified because she only used one hand to touch the pool wall when turning around, which is a pity. The score was 3 minutes and 41.1 seconds. Therefore, Ms. Chen Huanqiong, who came in second place, was promoted to first place with a score of 3 minutes and 58 seconds. Liu Guizhen was second, and Philippine Sun Tai was third.</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from Manila, this newspaper, 16th) In the swimming competition, Chinese women also won the 200-meter relay, with a score of 2 minutes and 41.7 seconds. The first three people from China and the Philippines had the same speed. The last person, Yang Xiuqiong and Philippine Liemo, entered the water at the same time. Yang exceeded Liemo by three meters and reached the finish line. Yang's personal championship is not a problem. Yang's victory in the 100-meter freestyle and 100-meter backstroke is very likely. The award ceremony will be held tomorrow. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Event / First Place / Second Place / Third Place / Score</p>
<p>50-meter Freestyle / Yang Xiuqiong (China) / Losita (Philippines) / Liu Guizhen (China) / 36.9 seconds</p>
<p>200-meter Breaststroke / Chen Huanqiong (China) / Liu Guizhen (China) / Sun Tai (Philippines) / 3 minutes and 58 seconds</p>
<p>200-meter Relay / China / Philippines / 2 minutes and 41.7 seconds</p>
<p>The Chinese relay lineup is as follows: (1) Liu Guizhen, (2) Chen Huanqiong, (3) Liang Yongxian, (4) Yang Xiuqiong.</p>
<p>Yang Xiuqiong's 50-meter freestyle, 36.9 seconds, and the Chinese team's 200-meter relay, 2 minutes and 41.7 seconds, both broke our country's national records.</p>

<h3>Vice President of the Conference Hosts Athletes from Various Countries</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Manila, 16th) Vice President of the Far Eastern Games, Fanges, hosted a tea dance party for the athletes at 5:00 PM on the 16th.</p>
<h3>Japanese Athletes Will Come to Shanghai to Compete</h3>
<p>(Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 16th) According to the announcement of the Japan Sports Association Headquarters, when the two representatives, Matsuzawa and Abe, went to Manila via Shanghai, powerful Japanese residents said that sports between China and Japan had been interrupted since the Manchurian Incident, and they hoped that Japanese athletes would take the Shanghai route on their way back from the Manila expedition and compete with China. This matter has been discussed in the delegation, but it depends on whether the postal ship passes through Shanghai. Fortunately, the Pacific Maru has decided to pass through Shanghai, and the Japanese athletes have also decided to take the land competition in Shanghai is now complete.</p>
<h3>Wang Yuzeng Scores a Goal in the Last Ten Seconds Our Basketball Team Wins Against Japan Again | 48 to 47, One Point More |</h3>
<p>The Japanese launched a counterattack in the second half, surpassing us twice</p>
<p>Wang Yuzeng's long shot was beautiful and meritorious</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from Manila, this newspaper, 16th) Tonight, in the second Sino-Japanese basketball game, in the last ten seconds, our country was fortunate to rely on Wang Yuzeng's accurate shot, defeating Japan with a score of 48 to 47, by one point. Wang Yuzeng's performance was still the best in the team, and his beautiful long shot was praised by the audience.</p>
<h3>Japanese Have More Endurance Than Us</h3>
<p>Our country's athletes fought fiercely tonight, and everyone worked hard to fight, but their endurance was not as good as Japan's. In the first ten minutes, the work was meticulous and commendable, but it gradually became loose. The Japanese athletes fought fiercely and had better physical strength than us, and their cooperation gradually improved. The referees were still Winselo and Salfortu.</p>
<h3>Our Country's Ball Luck is Not Good</h3>
<p>In the first half, our country's athletes frequently scored with skillful communication, once leading Japan by as much as ten points with a score of 17 to 7. The Japanese athletes launched a desperate counterattack and gradually caught up. The result of the first half was 23 to 19, with our country leading by four points. In the first half, our country's ball luck was not very good. More than a dozen shots that could have been made did not enter the basket.</p>
<h3>The Score Became Even Closer</h3>
<p>From the second half onwards, the Japanese</p>
<p>offensive became even more intense, and the score became even closer, with the difference often being three or four points, gradually becoming twenty-nine to twenty-seven, with our country only leading by two points. However, afterwards, we still took the lead with thirty-nine to thirty-four. At thirty-nine to thirty-eight, Japanese forward Inoue scored another goal, and the Japanese team led forty to thirty-nine,</p>
<p>surpassing us by one point.</p>
<p>Victory with the Last Throw Amidst these unfavorable times</p>
<p>, our country strove hard and finally tied the score at forty-six each. In this critical moment, our side was penalized for a foul, and the Japanese team led again with forty-seven to forty-six, surpassing us. With only ten seconds left in the game, Wang Yuzeng scored the deciding goal, and our country won with forty-eight to forty-seven. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>China Throws Foul Points Japan Throws Foul Points</p>

<h3>An Unexpected Point: Wu Bixian Fourth in High Jump; Liu Changchun and Others Fail in Preliminaries</h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from our newspaper in Manila, 16th) Today, the athletics competition began, and fortunately, with Wu Bixian's efforts, we obtained a valuable point by winning fourth place in the high jump.

<h3>High Jump Veteran Champion; Wu Bixian Fourth</h3>
<p>(Dentsu News Agency, Manila, 16th) In the high jump final, the Philippines' Torrebiar fought bitterly with Japan's Asakuma, vying for first place. Both easily cleared six feet and then increased to six feet five inches. Both failed to clear. They then lowered it to six feet four inches and then three inches, but failed to clear six feet two inches. Torrebiar cleared it on the first attempt, while Asakuma failed on all attempts. Torrebiar won first place. As the decisive battle for victory approached, the Japanese expatriates cheered Asakuma's valiant fight. China's Wu Bixian also fought hard to obtain fourth place. The Chinese army only won one valuable point today. (1) Torrebiar (Philippines) 6 feet 4 inches; (2) Asakuma Yoshirō (Japan); (3) Adachi Kiyoshi (Japan); (4) Wu Bixian (China).</p>
<p>(Nissha, Manila, 16th) The results of the high jump are as follows: (1) Trivio (Philippines) 1 meter 93 (6 feet 4 inches); (2) Asakuma Yoshirō (Japan) 1 meter 93; (3) Adachi Kiyoshi (Japan) 1 meter 87.9 (6 feet 2 inches); (4) Wu Bixian (China) 1 meter 87.9.

<h3>Long Jump Japan Has Unique Strength, Result of 7 Meters 30</h3>
<p>(Dentsu 16th Manila) In the long jump final, the Japanese team has a traditional and unique strength. Tajima, Harada, and others, the opinion of certain victory, overflowed in their eyebrows. The Philippines' Ramirez, Carino, and others, also hoped to win the championship, and did not show weakness to each other. However, under the competition, first place was finally obtained by Japanese athlete Tajima, Harada was second, the Japanese flag was raised again, and the music of Kimigayo was played. The Japanese cheering squad all stood up again and sent warm applause. (1) Tajima Naoto (Japan) 7 seconds 30, (2) Harada Masao (Japan), (3) Ramirez (Philippines), (4) Carino (Philippines).</p>

<h3>Discus Creates New Record; Japanese Athletes Struggle</h3>
<p>(Dentsu News Agency, Manila, 16th) In today's discus final, Kikumoto Kosaku took the lead, followed by Fujita and Liu Yuehan. On the third throw, the Philippines' Amandan surprised everyone, surpassing Leiben. On the fourth, fifth, and sixth throws, the Japanese side tried hard to catch up, but because the field was slippery after the rain, it was difficult to exert force. In the end, first place was won by the Philippines. (1) Amandan (Philippines) 42 meters 545, new Games record; (2) Kikumoto Kosaku (Japan) 42 meters 21, new Games record; (3) Fujita Kiyoji (Japan) 4000 meters 35, 4th Liu Yuehan (Japan) 39 meters 86.</p>

<p>(Dentsu News Agency, Manila, 16th) After the start of the 1500-meter final, the Philippines' Florencha led, followed by Gasco, Yetaier, and Andes. In the second lap, Yanagida Nagaharu gradually caught up, and Tanaka and Tsuyuki also surpassed him. Uchida's energy was insufficient and it was difficult to finish the race. At 700 meters, Yanagida Nagaharu began to increase his speed. At that time, Lorencha felt powerless and fell behind, and Yetaier tried hard to catch up, trying to pass Yanagida Nagaharu. Nearing 1000 meters, Tanaka and Tsuyuki successively passed Yetaier, chasing after Yanagida. At that time, the order of advancement was Yanagida, Tanaka, and Tsuyuki. 9 meters away from Yetaier, the Japanese expatriates cheered in support. By the final lap, Japan occupied the first, second, and third places. At 1300 meters, Andes desperately chased after Yanagida, competing with him. Tanaka took the absolute lead, setting a new record. The results are as follows: (1) Tanaka Hideo (Japan) 4 minutes 3 seconds 5, new Far Eastern record; (2) Yanagida Nagaharu (Japan) 4 minutes 4 seconds 5, (new Far Eastern record); (3) Anders (Philippines) 4 minutes 5 seconds 5, (new Far Eastern record); (4) Tsuyuki (Japan).</p>

<h3>Where Is the Former Glory Now? Our Country's Volleyball Team Actually Loses to Japan; A Miserable Defeat of One to Three; Lack of Cooperation Is the Main Reason for Failure</h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from our newspaper in Manila, 16th) Today, our country's volleyball team was actually defeated by Japan. The lack of teamwork was the reason for the failure. The competition situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Japan {22 to 20, 27 to 25, 5 to 21, 22 to 17} China</p>
<p>In the first game, due to our team's lack of cooperation, although we scored first, Japan still took the lead in the first half of the game with 11 to 8. The competition in the second half was very fierce, and the score was equal four times. When Japan was ahead by one point at 20 to 21, our country made a kill shot that went out of bounds, and we lost the first game with 20 to 22.</p>
<p>Second Game: The battle was even more intense. In the first half, our team was ahead by one point at 11 to 10. In the middle, we lost three points due to touching the net three times, which was a great pity. In the second half, our team was repeatedly ahead by two points, and then the score was tied nine times at 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25. In the end, due to lack of patience, Japan won the last two points, 25 to 27, and lost the second game again.</p>
<p>Third Game: Our country won the third game with 21 to 15, which was very easy.</p>
<p>Fourth Game: But in the fourth game, due to being in a state of panic, many mistakes were made, and we failed with 17 to 21, and thus failed in the overall match.</p>
<h3>Men's Swimming First Day: Our Country's Athletes Completely Fail; Far East Games Records Wiped Out</h3>
<p>(Nissha, Manila, 16th) The swimming competition opened today. The aim of the Philippine athletes is to defeat the Japanese team. Since February of this year, they have been under the guidance of supervisor Barto, practicing intensely. Their records are kept strictly secret, so that outsiders cannot know. The most interesting item in the swimming program is the breaststroke. Philippine athletes Yierde Fangsha and Jichikiram competed with Japan's Koike. Koike's strength is outstanding, and there is no doubt that he will win first place. However, the Philippine athletes are eyeing him closely, not allowing optimism. The result of the competition may produce a new world record.</p>
<p>Swimming started yesterday. Our country's athletes completely failed. None of them ranked in the preliminary round. In the three preliminary events, Japan was dominant, and the Far East Games records were completely broken. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>50 Meters Freestyle</h3>
<p>(Dentsu News Agency, Manila, 16th) The Far East Games swimming competition, when the maritime kingdom of Japan is active, was held at the newly built swimming pool at 5:00 pm today. The first event was the preliminary round of the 50 meters, which was divided into Group A and Group B. The first place in each group was won by Japanese athletes, and they both set new records, taking an absolute advantage. Therefore, the Japanese cheering squad in the audience was very happy.</p>
<p>First Group (1) Toyoda Hisakichi (Japan) 26.4 seconds, new Games record; (2) Ali (Philippines); (3) Nishi (Philippines).</p>
<p>Second Group (1) Takemura Kimiyoshi (Japan) 26.6 seconds, new Games record; (2) Rotillo (Philippines); (3) Hesemond (Dutch East Indies). The Games record for the 50 meters was 26.8 seconds by Orga (Philippines) and Takahashi Shigeo (Japan).</p>
<h3>200 Meters Breaststroke</h3>
<p>(Dentsu News Agency, Manila, 16th) In the first group of the 200-meter breaststroke preliminary round, Alachaite and Chikiren of the Philippine Islands both broke the Games record of 2 minutes 52.9 seconds, giving the Philippines an advantage. In the second group, Japanese athlete Koike Reizo was even more active, setting a new record of 2 minutes 45.1 seconds. He is certain to win first place in the final. Yielt Pongso, the second-place athlete in that group, also broke the previous record.</p>
<p>First Group 2 minutes 48.1 seconds, new Games record: (1) Ala Te (Philippines); (2) Chikiren (Philippines); (3) Yemuro Tetsuo (Japan).</p>
<p>Second Group 2 minutes 45.1 seconds: (1) Koike Reizo (Japan); (2) Yielt Pongso (Philippines); (3) Arepeiles (Philippines).</p>
<h3>400 Meters Freestyle</h3>
<p>(Dentsu News Agency, Manila, 16th) The 400-meter freestyle swimming preliminary round was originally intended to be a solo stage for Japan. As expected, the first and second places in both the first and second groups were won by Japanese athletes, and all four broke the Games record of 5 minutes 2 seconds 4.</p>
<p>First Group 5 minutes 0 seconds 9, new Games record: (1) Yokoyama Takashi (Japan) (2) Kataoka Torajiro (Japan); (3) Kotdam (Philippines).</p>
<p>Second Group 4 minutes 56 seconds 1, new Games record: (1) Niima Rokubee (Japan); (2) Sugimoto Mori (Japan); (3) Quec Luo Wei, Philippines.</p>
<h3>China-Philippines Baseball Second Game: Our Country Loses Again; Philippines Wins 14-0</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Manila, 16th) The result of the China-Philippines baseball game at 3:00 pm on the 16th was that the Philippines defeated China 14-0.</p>
<p>(Dentsu Manila, 16th) The second China-Philippines baseball match was held at the baseball field at 3:00 pm. The Philippine side sent out the second team. However, the pitcher Batista's strange skills were surprising and completely suppressed the Chinese team, causing them to lose without scoring. The match started with China batting first. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>China 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0丨0 0 6</p>
<p>Philippines 4 2 3 1 1 0 0 1 A 丨卜 卜</p>

<h3>Far East Games Executive Committee Meeting Delayed by One Day; Japanese Representatives Say They Lack Diplomatic Experience; Deeply Fear Our Country's Wang Zhengting's Activities</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Manila, 16th) The Far East Games Executive Committee meeting has now been rescheduled to be held on the 19th and 20th.</p>
<p>(Dentsu News Agency, Manila, 16th) The regular meeting to decide on the issue of Manchuria's participation, amend the constitution, and discuss the location of the next Games has been formally decided for the 18th and 19th. The original decision was for the meeting to last three days, on the 17th, 18th, and 19th. The reason for the sudden change this time is because there is fear that China will use the excuse of returning home to bury the constitutional issue. Therefore, the Japanese are strategizing to prevent China from returning home by linking the voting on the location of the next meeting with the voting on amending the constitution. However, the Japanese representatives lack diplomatic experience, and the opponent is China's Wang Zhengting, so the future is not optimistic. Furthermore, the Dutch East Indies is scheduled to return home on the night of the 19th, so if the meeting is delayed to the 10th, the Dutch East Indies will inevitably be absent. The question of the quorum for the regular meeting will depend on China's attitude. Therefore, the future situation is not optimistic.</p>

<h3>Boxing, Japan Wins All</h3>
<p>(Dentsu, Manila, 15th) The Japanese-Philippines boxing open performance, which was postponed due to rain, was held at the baseball field at 8:00 pm last night under light rain. Although it was an open performance, the audience was still full, and the cheering from both the Japanese and Philippine sides was extremely enthusiastic. The Japanese athletes maintained a spirited attitude throughout and suppressed the enemy, ultimately winning all the matches.</p>
<p>Lightweight: Nakano Chiyo (Japan) defeats Guciman (Philippines). Nakano's posture was excellent, and he launched fierce attacks from the left and right. Although he did not completely knock Guciman to the ground, he was completely judged to have won.</p>
<p>Light Lightweight: Kim Changhwa (Japan) defeats Gabgo (Philippines). Kim Changhwa adopted an offensive posture and struck Gabgo. Gab could not make a move and returned with complete victory. Middle Lightweight: Park Yongjin (Japan) defeats Alesde (Philippines). Park's moves were quick and cunning, striking Alesde's face and chest. Again, complete victory went to Park.</p>
<p>Light Heavyweight: Saito Shigemi (Japan) defeats Guo (Philippines). This was the most exciting match of the night. Saito and Guo engaged in fierce combat, but Saito ultimately prevailed and was judged to have won.</p>
<h3>Games in White-Hot State; Japanese Cheer Squad Working Hard</h3>
<p>(Nissha, Manila, 16th) The sixth day of the Games was again met with heavy rain. From dawn until near noon, the smoky rain did not stop, and rainwater formed pools in various competition venues, which was disappointing. However, after 2:00 pm, the rain stopped and the sky cleared, and the various competitions were held on schedule. The Games are in a white-hot state. On the 17th, in addition to five or ten competitions, the various land competitions should determine the winner or loser. There are also finals for 50-meter and 400-meter 20-meter swimming events, which can be said to be the highest tide of the Far East Games. Many Japanese expatriates entered the venue and worked hard to cheer. In addition to this, the audience was mostly Filipino women.</p>

<h3>Virtuous Officials Who Promote National Goods</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Promoting national goods is not a fad, nor is it a superficial matter. It requires genuine effort and support, and it requires high-ranking officials to lead by example to be effective.</p>
<p>I recently spoke with Mr. Chen Bulei, who said: "The most enthusiastic promoter of national goods is Chairman Lu of the Zhejiang Provincial Government. Chairman Lu's use of national goods is 'foolish' and 'self-realizing.' This old Mr. Lu himself admits that only by using 'foolish' methods to promote national goods can national goods have hope. He wants people to trust his words first, so he publicly inspects his own office and home. He first marks many utensils, marking those that are completely national goods with a red ring, foreign goods with a green ring, and those that are not purely national goods with a blue ring. After the inspection, he auctions off all non-national goods, vowing never to use them. One day, he specifically prepared items for the office and home in a national goods store, stating that everything must be national goods. Later, he discovered that one item was not a national good, so he called the merchant in the store and severely reprimanded him, believing that he should not deceive the people, mislead the country, and oppose national goods. Such a virtuous official who promotes national goods with genuine effort can be praised."</p>
<p>According to Mr. Bulei, he also advocates absolute use of national goods. He dislikes seeing many young people use foreign paper, pens, and ink to write. He believes that China has abundant paper production in various regions, as well as writing brushes and pine soot ink. Why use foreign paper, pens, and ink to help foreigners expand their sales? Therefore, when he was the Director of Education of Zhejiang Province, he required students in all schools to practice several pages of regular script every day. People in Mr. Chen's family always used Chinese stationery and Chinese brushes to communicate. Mr. Chen said that this alone could promote the sale of some national goods. He said, "Promoting national goods requires some foolishness and some courage to be effective." These words are so thorough and especially worth recording. The reporter hopes that every province and county will have such virtuous officials, and the future of national goods will have good results.</p>

<h3>Highway Construction and National Goods Promotion</h3>
<p>— Yi Feng</p>
<p>Everyone knows that inconvenient transportation and difficult logistics have significantly hindered the development of inland markets. Therefore, to prosper inland markets, it is necessary to develop transportation and resolve all logistical difficulties. However, given China's current financial and human resources, highway construction is the most effective shortcut to resolving these difficulties.</p>
<p>According to the recent work report of the Highway Department of the Economic Commission and news of road construction in various provinces, it is known that the connection of highways in seven provinces is currently being actively planned. Undoubtedly, when the plan is completed, inland products can be cheaply transported to cities for smooth sales. However, if the intrusion of foreign goods is not prevented, the consequences could be alarming. According to a communication from a military agency in Jianyang, Fujian, "Our department has been stationed in northern Fujian for nearly five years and deeply feels the inconvenience of transportation, which has led to the ignorance of the people and the decline of commerce... In the city, we feel the lack of daily necessities. Although there are some goods, most of them are foreign goods, and they are transferred from Fuzhou, resulting in high costs and difficult transportation, leading to incredibly high prices. Our department is now ordered to use military personnel to build roads. It is expected that by the end of May, Jianpu, Jianchong, Jian'ou, Jiangguang, and Jianyang will become the center of the four roads, the hub of transportation, and the development of commerce is just around the corner. We are afraid that foreign goods will flood in at that time, and the hard work of the officers and soldiers will be in vain, as if we are just building a sales market for foreign goods. It is painful to say." After reading this communication, we know that highway construction is urgent, and the intrusion of foreign goods must be addressed.</p>
<p>At this time, Shanghai national goods manufacturers are preparing to recover inland markets. If they can take this opportunity to set up more national goods promotion agencies in important towns along the highways, then highway construction may be a powerful support for national goods promotion. Otherwise, if we sit idly by and watch the forces of foreign goods take advantage of the convenience of transportation and lower costs to run rampant in the inland, then even if the inland market can thrive as a result, what benefit will it bring to the country and the nation?</p>
<h3>How to Get National Goods to the Countryside?</h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>In the last issue of this publication, there was a discussion about "National Goods to the Countryside." I think this is a topic worth discussing in this year of national goods.</p>
<p>Why do national goods need to go to the countryside? Do national goods need to go to the countryside? This is a question worth studying. Some people say, "National goods do not need to go to the countryside because most farmers in the countryside use things they make themselves, such as homespun cloth for clothing, household items, etc. If national goods go to the countryside, wouldn't that shorten the lifespan of ten goods and accelerate the bankruptcy of the countryside?" This argument seems correct at first glance, but after thinking carefully, it is a misconception.</p>
<p>Facts tell us that the dumping of inferior goods in recent years has reached a very urgent point. Moreover, the dumping of Japanese goods is not only focused on our country's cities but also heavily focused on our country's countryside. We only need to go to the countryside to see how tense this crisis has become. Most farmers have already adopted foreign goods, especially inferior goods. If we tell them the meaning of using national goods, they will find it cumbersome. We think: Is this crisis dangerous? Is this situation tense? Therefore, inviting national goods to the countryside is a very important thing. How to get national goods to the countryside? I have thought of many methods and many ideas. I feel that if we can start from the following items, we can definitely achieve considerable results and give a major blow to inferior goods.</p>
<p>(1) Establish Branches of National Goods Companies: In recent years, many national goods companies have been established to promote national goods, but most of these national goods companies are in cities. I believe that in various towns and villages, we should open more branches of national goods companies to reduce the opportunity for the general public to buy inferior goods.</p>
<p>(2) National Goods Should Adopt a Small Profit Policy: The biggest reason farmers buy inferior goods is the low price. Therefore, if national goods want to compete with inferior goods and penetrate the countryside, they must reduce the price of goods as much as possible and adopt a small profit and quick turnover policy. In this way, we can increase their interest in using them by making the price suitable for farmers' purchasing power.</p>
<p>(3) Hold More Exhibitions and Lectures: Farmers in the countryside are generally ignorant and know little. They don't know what is a national good and what is not a national good. Therefore, those responsible for promoting national goods and many national goods organizations should hold more exhibitions in the countryside and hold lectures to make farmers aware of the word "national good" and to make them know the meaning of using national goods.</p>
<p>(4) Set Up National Goods Mobile Vehicles: Major national goods factories and national goods companies can set up national goods mobile vehicles, with several national goods installed on the vehicles. Hire people to patrol the countryside and be responsible for promoting national goods. This method can also achieve some results. The Women's National Goods Year Movement Committee has already started manufacturing this kind of mobile vehicle, and I hope it will be realized soon and that it can patrol the countryside.</p>

<h3>Promoting China's Four Treasures of the Study</h3>
<p>— Meng Zhao</p>
<p>| Paper, Brush, Ink |</p>
<p>Foreign Conklin, red and blue ink, and Fuji paper fill the entire Chinese school. When my children first enter elementary school, the teacher asks the students to buy fountain pens, etc. This is truly a major crisis for our country! Although the fountain pen has been produced by the Zhongnan Industrial Factory, it is still not enough.</p>
<p>Let's go out into society and take a look. Banks and companies are lined with foreign Four Treasures of the Study, fountain pens, ink, and foreign paper, full of foreign style! But the writers and scholars who hold pens to write and shout to promote national goods and recover rights and interests also use goods from foreign sources. Is this any different from a foreign-clothed gentleman in a foreign suit giving a speech on national goods? It is truly a pitiful contradiction and a laughingstock!</p>
<p>The country is not yet dead! The painful realization has given us a deep stimulus! I hope everyone will quickly promote our Chinese Four Treasures of the Study - Huzhou brushes, Huizhou ink, and Mao Bian paper - to save China! Let's not continue to be so heartbroken!</p>

<h3>Gleanings from the Opening of the West Shanghai National Goods Temporary Market</h3>
<p>— Qiu Hong</p>
<p>The West Shanghai National Goods Market, located at the end of Jing'an Temple Road, is organized by the Women's National Goods Year Movement Committee. It is built on the site of the former St. George's Ballroom with dozens of wooden houses covered with lead sheets, giving it a unique style. The participating shops, nearly one hundred, are arranged with the Home Industry Cooperative, Jinlang Company, Jinglun Shirt and Socks Factory, and other companies. It seems that they have been carefully planned. The market is covered with coal ash, making it difficult for women with high-heeled leather shoes to walk.</p>
<p>Every step is difficult, and the strong sunlight makes everyone pant and sweat. At the opening ceremony, a silk ribbon was placed across the entrance. A female employee from a certain store came in a rickshaw and was blocked by the ribbon. She got off the rickshaw and crawled under the ribbon.</p>
<p>Bowing and Entering</p>
<p>When the people gathered in front of the gate to watch the opening ceremony, they saw the woman entering in this way and shouted in unison, "Bow!" Those who heard it smiled. After the wife of Mayor Wu Tiecheng of this city cut the red silk ribbon with scissors, the opening ceremony was completed. As the music rose and fell, the audience outside the gate swarmed in. The small house occupied by the Huamei Tobacco Company was located opposite the central gate of the market. Anyone who bought two yuan worth of products from the company was given a</p>
<p>Standard Beauty</p>
<p>Xu Lai's photo. The person looked at it repeatedly and suddenly asked the clerk, "Is there a butterfly?" A person next to him quickly replied, "The butterfly hasn't arrived today. The beautiful picture of the Standard Beauty is also very good." The reporter saw the company give out as many as twelve celebrity photos in five minutes. In addition to the various shops in the market that supply daily necessities, there is also a Buddhist bookstore selling chimes, glazed lamps, and other</p>
<p>Monk's Dharma Instruments</p>
<p>for sale. A child insisted on buying a red lacquer wooden fish, and his mother, reluctantly, bought a string of prayer beads and wrapped it around the child's neck, looking like Puyi in his childhood. After Mrs. Mayor Wu circled around and visited, she left in her own car with her secretary and others. Those who arrived later still frequently inquired about Mrs. Mayor's whereabouts.</p>

<h3>Records of Incense Faintly Drifting</h3>
<p>— Original work by Princess Der Ling of Qing, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>As for matters of paperwork, there were even fewer of those – practically none at all. Originally, these cushy jobs with no work were Qing Shan's way of taking care of his relatives, because his relatives were all very lazy sorts. Although they wanted to earn money, they were unwilling to do real work. Thus, everyone used their relationship with him to force Qing Shan to place them in positions. This kind of situation was very common in China. No matter who it was, as long as they managed to get themselves into a position where they had the authority to employ people, their relatives and old friends would immediately surround them, forcing them to hire as many private individuals as possible, the more the better. And in the Qing Dynasty bureaucracy, this situation was especially prevalent.</p>
<p>My second older brother was certainly no exception. Although I don't know the exact number of his staff, I can guarantee that they did nothing but sit around and chat. In fact, my second older brother didn't expect them to do any work when he hired them. So, readers can easily imagine the situation in our family. Not only did my second older brother have so many parasitic staff members, but my fourth younger brother also kept several in the same way, and my father had even more. The total number of these three groups combined was at least twenty or thirty. So, no matter how big our own house was, or how big the house we rented was, there would never be an empty room. And often it wasn't enough. Under these circumstances, my father, my second older brother, or my fourth younger brother had to spend extra money to rent some houses outside, so that these parasites could live comfortably.</p>
<p>That being said, the court also owed it to those outwardly impressive but inwardly rotten ministers, standing there in their colorful robes, to create an atmosphere of elegance and grandeur. And on this trip, it was also thanks to the entourage of Xun Ling and Qing Shan that the court did not completely lose its dignity. (35)</p>
<h3>Speeding</h3>
<p>— Qian Zuizhu</p>
<p>The public sports field and the people of Suzhou have never seemed to have much to do with each other. Despite the 'park' being so close that it could be measured by a single glance, it was packed to the brim, while only a handful of people were exercising in the sports field. Or perhaps a few children were left, adding a touch of liveliness.</p>
<p>But when I walked past it today, the situation had changed completely. The deserted sports field was surrounded by an impenetrable crowd. Driven by curiosity, I squeezed my way in.</p>
<p>'These two students have already run twenty-one laps. What real skill!' One</p>
<p>Spectator, with sleeves folded, was exclaiming.</p>
<p>'I heard that they have to run forty laps. Aren't they afraid of getting tired?' another replied.</p>
<p>Looking across, I saw two young people running in the distance, with a track drawn on the ground with chalk. I thought to myself that this must be a 10,000-meter practice. Just as I was thinking this, I suddenly heard a burst of applause coming from another crowd. Looking over, I saw that they were doing pole vaulting.</p>
<p>There were seven young people competing here. Watching them gradually rise from 2.08 meters, they passed over easily at first, but when it was raised to 2.56 meters, only two were left competing. But due to the running performance, victory ultimately belonged to the young man with the 'Su Gong' (Suzhou Industry) label, while the one with the number '252' failed.</p>
<p>At the same time, the basketball court was still filled with intense competition, and the two young men practicing for the 10,000 meters were still running enthusiastically.</p>
<p>As I walked out of the field gate, I suddenly heard someone say from behind me: 'I didn't expect our fast train to be running in the wild.'</p>
<p>I suddenly remembered that the Far Eastern Games were being held in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Athletes who are fighting for national glory, I wish you a special express train.</p>
<h3>Has the Peony Bloomed?</h3>
<p>— He Ru</p>
<p>There is a famous Chinese custom: 'Viewing peonies on the third day of the third lunar month.' People in Beiping (Beijing) add: 'Viewing peonies at Chongxiao Temple.' This is because the peonies are best at Chongxiao Temple. Every spring, leisurely scholars and officials would bring wine and flasks, spending the entire day there. Now, Beiping is in turmoil, with several alarms a day. Who is in the mood to view peonies? However, I am the laziest person in China, and I am already over fifty years old. I might as well imitate Xu Xiake and travel all over the world. Also, the house in Beiping was left by my great-grandfather, and my family has lived in it for many years. After leaving Beijing, I handed it over to my family to take care of. My Shuangtong Xuan (Double Paulownia Study) has more than a dozen peony plants. Some were transplanted from Luoyang County by my great-grandfather, some were transplanted from the Taizhou Prefecture office by my grandfather, some were brought back by my father during his tenure as Education Commissioner of Guangxi, and some were bought by me in Xuancheng, Anhui. Speaking of peonies, the peonies in my Shuangtong Xuan, although not the best in the country, are superior to those in Chongxiao Temple in Beiping. Only because of the danger in Pingjin (Beiping and Tianjin), I want to sell the house. The peonies, because they were left by my ancestors and have been cherished by me all my life, should be moved to the south like the government moving antiques. Wouldn't that be wonderful! Unexpectedly, this has caused an unexpected disturbance. Yesterday, I arrived at the Chengxiang Hutong in Beiping, opened the door of Shuangtong Xuan, and went to the flower terrace to look at the peonies. There were originally thirteen plants, but now there are only five left. Although the buds have not yet opened, the flowers are showing signs of joy, knowing that their master has returned from afar and deliberately opened one. Only the herbaceous peony from Xuancheng suddenly disappeared in the middle of the night. And someone wrote a letter of warning, which has become a big joke. Now, I am not selling my house, and I am not moving the peonies. I will leave it to fate. It is better to do one thing less than to do one thing more. Originally, someone invited me to go to Chongxiao Temple to see the peonies, but I was not happy to go, so I returned to be a parasite in my rented concession.</p>
<h3>Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twenty-Eight: Qiaotai Together Views a Scene, Foolish Affectionately Picks Up a Handkerchief, Yin Moves Two to Ask About Illness, Misunderstanding Submits a Letter</p>
<p>Stopping at this regular script character, it can be seen that the skill of this entire text is as deep as that of the regular script character, namely:</p>
<p>Mr. Guizhi: I myself never dreamed that there would be an opportunity to write to you, so I cannot guess what your feelings will be when you read this letter. But judging from recent facts, I think that you will be very happy when you receive this letter, so I considered it for a day and a night, and finally I still wrote it to you. A year ago, we would never have thought of being friends. Later, we almost couldn't even be friends. This is not my fault, but it is not your fault either. There were some misunderstandings. How could there have been misunderstandings? I can only say that it was fate. Even now, I still regret why I didn't make up my mind to break away from my brother and sister-in-law 'individually', and put it into practice earlier? If I had done this last year today, I don't think I would have this kind of distress this year today. Even in the smallest sense, I wouldn't have caught this cold yesterday. I am very grateful for your kindness in asking your mother to visit me twice today. I am very grateful. The five words 'very grateful' are not just ordinary polite words. You should know that the extent of my gratitude is almost to the point of crying. Because before, I unintentionally found your handkerchief, and I was already a little moved. When I casually got a bit of a cold, you were so concerned about me. This is definitely not something that ordinary friends can do. For the past six months, I thought that you had forgotten your feelings for me. This was completely my mistake. Now I understand that not only have you not forgotten your feelings for me, but because I cannot understand your difficulties, your heart is even more pained. (386)</p>

<h3>Book Covering</h3>
<p>— Xu Junxian</p>
<p>I still remember that every morning and afternoon, A Jin 丨the servant丨carried me on his back, and I only brought one reader with a book, no paper, no pen, and sometimes two runny noses. When the snot ran out, I would desperately suck it back up.</p>
<p>After some time, afraid of being laughed at by others, I began 'walking to school'. But; A Jin still picked me up and dropped me off. The books were not just one, and they gradually increased. So, I used Shenbao paper or white cloth as a schoolbag. At that time, when I had a runny nose, I would wipe it on my sleeve.</p>
<p>Mo Fei, the lyricist, showed me a new willow lyric in the original tune, which I echoed, but the sorrowful words did not match the theme and not long after, a few foreign books were added, and to show off, I bought a schoolbag strap. Later, I carried a small leather suitcase. At that time, A Jin no longer needed to pick me up and drop me off, because I could take the tram or bus alone. And there was much less snot, and when necessary, I would use a handkerchief as a sleeve.</p>
<p>Now! I live at school, I no longer commute! The progress of book covering is permanent progress. But what about him? A Jin is already lying peacefully in the ground!</p>
<h3>Willow Shoots Green</h3>

<p>Testing the warm wind, the mad wind, the roasted grass is drunk, the spring is worth being surprised by. Red rope, soft branches, red railing low shadow, how many days of sunny overcast. The Eastern Emperor's color is heavily applied. Can you ask if there is a cloud-like eyebrow to continue the clouds. I only feel sad, broken jade, dusty box silk skirt.</p>
<p>Sickbed eyebrow is lonely, the horizon pavilion post, still affectionately tied. Who believes deeply, the green city railings, are not in the human world. Qingming Cold Food year after year. Listening to thousands of orioles crying. Yellow is already pitiful, let alone teaching green later, trailing rain and smoke.</p>
<p>Small Craft</p>
<h3>New Life of Handmade Paper Industry</h3>
<p>— Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>When the Lesser Fullness season arrives, papermakers in the inland areas mostly cut new bamboo at this time to soak for a year's use. The capital is relatively heavy, and the work is slow. It is no wonder that the selling price cannot be cheap. In fact, old bamboo can also make paper. They only adhere to old methods and do not know how to use chemistry, so old bamboo cannot be used. If they change to a new method of making pulp, they can make paper pulp all year round to facilitate turnover. I will describe it as follows:</p>
<p>Assuming that the original paper trough can produce ten pieces of paper per day, and three thousand pieces per year, preparing materials for one thousand loads, each load is calculated at five yuan, requiring a capital of five thousand yuan. After making paper, when sold, each load gets eleven yuan, just enough to offset the capital and profit. The monthly profit obtained is at most only five hundred yuan. Each piece of labor is calculated at two yuan, that is, three hundred pieces require six hundred yuan. If the new method of making pulp is changed, specially order a fixed amount of labor, and copy out pieces of paper, regardless of thickness or breakage, all can be turned into money. Let’s calculate at five times the production volume, that is, fifty pieces can be produced every day, and each piece of labor only costs four corners. Twenty loads of materials are used every day, then one thousand loads of materials can be used up in just two months, turning into cash to facilitate turnover. Six turns a year, each turn of eleven thousand yuan, can get sixty-six thousand yuan. But the profit of paper pulp is not so heavy, so it cannot compete with wood pulp, and should also be reduced to one-fifth, that is, each load of material costs eleven yuan. Twenty loads per day can earn 66,000 yuan a year, which is three times the profit of handmade paper. Try to explain it further to make it clear.</p>
<p>(1) The bamboo-producing area only sells at one time. Assuming that the original sales were 10,000 yuan, now it can sell 60,000 yuan. This has six times the income for mountain households, and the selling price can be reduced. If the mountain is judged by the year, it is even more cost-effective. Regular adoption means that there is no need to harvest as much as possible at one time, then hiring long-term workers will also be cheaper, because old bamboo can also make paper, so there is no need to work at the same time in an instant.</p>
<p>(2) As mentioned above, the output is not a problem, and the sales volume can be increased six times, that is, six times the labor should be used. The original capacity of 1,000 people can now accommodate 6,000 people. This is of great benefit to the lives of farmers.</p>
<p>(3) Those who set up paper troughs can still work as usual, and may as well follow the old method to avoid doubts. Just need to use another 5,000 yuan of capital, and use the new method of making pulp as a sideline. The copy workers do not need to be experts, that is, all unlearned people can fish out pieces of paper, regardless of thickness, breakage. Use any method, either dry or bake, or even transport it out with water, and cooperate with the factory, you can get another big profit. This allows the labor capacity of the paper troughs to increase a lot, and the capitalists can get profits quickly and without delay, so why be afraid not to do it.</p>
<p>As for the method of cooperating with the factory, it is also worth trying on a small scale to dispel doubts on both sides. Suppose a certain amount of bamboo material is installed first, and people are sent to the factory to work with their own eyes. On the one hand, they can practice engineering, and on the other hand, they can check how much paper is produced and how much coal and electricity are used. Then, a cooperation agreement is signed to determine the number of accounts to be split. No matter who sells it, it can be distributed according to the agreed share, and each party gets its own profit. Each party calculates its own profits and losses without restraint. This kind of cooperation is really a fair and equitable method, and there can be no fraud. The factory must be willing to do it, but a small test requires at least five or six hundred loads of material, otherwise it is impossible to get it on the machine. As for the paper produced, no matter what, it can always be turned into money. Taking advantage of this harvest season of new bamboo, soak the material with lime and ship it out. It is quite easy to do. Why not do it? The cries of rural bankruptcy are loud, but no one is willing to open up a source of profit for the local area. It is like having land but not planting it, and crying for hunger to the sky. Its ignorance is really beyond reach. In general, their vision is too shallow, and they only think about small things. They think about benefiting themselves and harming others, and they take plunder as the goal. They are not willing to do things that benefit others and benefit themselves. This is really a major cause of disease for handicraft industrialists.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Think and Act</h3>
<p>— Manxue</p>
<p>As long as it's not relied upon to solve national policy or organize wars, saying a few humorous words among friends, causing them to smile knowingly, I don't think it matters much. Even revolutionary experts sometimes stroll with their hands clasped behind their backs: philosophy professors invariably have children, proving that they are not proper and dignified day and night. Light essays will probably still exist in the literary world in the future, but being mainly 'leisurely' is slightly insufficient.</p>
<p>In human affairs, people often hate the cassock because they hate the monk. In the beginning, no one had any objections to humor and short essays. However, with a bang, everything became humorous and short essays. There wasn't that much humor, so humor became slapstick, slapstick became telling jokes, telling jokes became satire, and satire became abusive rants. Oily and glib talk, humor: "The sky is clear and the air is fresh," short essay: read Zheng Banqiao's Daoqing (Taoist lyrics) once, talk about humor for ten days, buy half a volume of Yuan Zhonglang's letters, write a short essay. Some people had the momentum to make a name for themselves with this, and there would inevitably be those who wanted to become famous by opposing it. So, with a bang, everyone was scolding humor and short essays. In fact, the people who join the bandwagon are as numerous this year as they were last year.</p>
<p>Holding black lacquered leather lanterns, they are all confused. In short, a noun naturalizes into China, and soon it becomes a mess. "Great man" was a good term before, but now receiving it is equivalent to being scolded; "scholar" and "professor" were still clean names two or three years ago: those who cherish themselves flee from the title of "literary master", and this year the first step has already begun. But, are there really no real great men, real scholars and professors, real literary masters in the world? Not at all. Only China is an exception.</p>
<p>If someone spits on the roadside, squats down and looks at it, soon it will be surrounded by a crowd; and if another person suddenly shouts loudly and runs away, everyone will probably scatter. I really don't know "what they heard to come, what they saw to leave", but they are still dissatisfied, scolding their incomprehensible object as "damn it!" But, those who spit and shout are, in the final analysis, big shots. Of course, there are calm and practical people. However, the honor or contempt for the name of "great man" etc. is generally just a substitute for spit.</p>
<p>Society relies on this to add some excitement, which is worth being grateful for. But think before joining the crowd, and think before the crowd disperses. Society may not become calm, but it should still be a little more decent.</p>
<h3>Before Lu Yin's Coffin</h3>
<p>— Chao Yi</p>
<p>The female writer Lu Yin has passed away! Those who know this news will probably sigh.</p>
<p>The afternoon of the day after her death (the 14th) was the time of her encoffining. With a sad mood, I walked to the Chinese Funeral Home. The air there did not seem to be in pain, as if it were symbolizing her misfortune. She was right in the center of the auditorium, quietly lying with her works! Looking at her gray face, I vaguely remembered a few words from her "Sorrow of a Certain Person":</p>
<p>"Dear friend KY: My illness is hopeless! ······</p>
<p>I am in the world,</p>
<p>But just a cloud in space!</p>
<p>A gust of wind will blow me away,</p>
<p>Do I still need to think back and forth?"</p>
<p>This is no less than her own elegy. Of course, she did not expect to die so quickly and so tragically.</p>
<p>After her friends Liu Dajie, Shu Xincheng, etc. reported her life history and recent life, the clock struck six, and it was the time for her to say goodbye to the world forever and close the coffin!</p>
<p>Some people have criticized her works: excessive individualism, too many sentimental elements. And they said that she and Bing Xin were stuck on the road of the May Fourth Movement! But recently, after her "Flame" and others were published in various magazines, some people happily said: Lu Yin's style has changed, and from now on she will embark on a new path of development! Now, I think it is the time to speak.</p>
<p>What exactly is Lu Yin's work like? It is precisely the time for our critics to pick up their pens. I pondered like this. I left with a sad mood, and I returned with a sad mood! (May 14th night)</p>

<p>From "New Copies of Letters from Laigu Hall", I learned about Xiao Shiwei's person, and reading his strange theories about taking concubines, the impression I got was not very good. In the catalog of old bookstores, I saw the catalog of Shiwei's complete works, and the diary accounted for more than half of it, and there was no such example in ancient complete works, which also felt a bit strange. And when I bought it and read it carefully, I felt that his diary was ultimately weak compared to the works of the Ming loyalists of the same period, such as Ye Tianliao and Gui Zhuang. This public figure, in his collection, boasted and praised himself, just like the Shanghai literary figures of today, not just once, but this cannot increase his literary price. In my understanding, a "Complete Collection of Spring Floating Garden" is less of a remarkable and extraordinary work, and more of a book that can be redeemed, which is more practical and appropriate.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>Here I just want to talk about his diary. Xiao Shiwei's evaluation of diary literature is extremely high. Qian Muzhai wrote the preface to "Separate Collection of Spring Floating Garden", saying that he "often said that Ouyang Xiu's 'Records of Official Service', and Lu You's 'Records of Entering Shu', were casual and uninhibited, and writing quickly, were the best texts in the world." And he himself said in the preface to "Southern Return Diary" that "I read Ouyang Xiu's 'Records of Official Service', and Lu You's 'Records of Entering Shu', and the notes were like rain in the sky, small and large, scattered and natural." Such articles, like raindrops in the sky, are scattered and pleasing, and are also obtained by those who are idle and quiet. Those who escape the rain may not think so." His love and understanding of diary writing can be seen from this. Generally speaking, it is a bit of an exaggeration to regard diary writing as "the best texts in the world", but "like rain in the sky, small and large, scattered and natural," is very pertinent. Among the diaries of past masters, he most admired Lu You, which can be seen in his diary. "Casual Records of Spring Floating Garden" Gengwu Volume, July 22, says: "Reading Fan Shihus's 'Wu Boat' and 'Cuan Luan' records, although not as wonderful as Lu You's 'Records of Entering Shu', the intention of sincerity still exists, so it is readable. However, recent travel records are like Su Shi's so-called Du Mo's song, like a Shandong scholar drinking village wine, eating plague-dead beef, what is uttered after being drunk and full." In the same year, "May 14, very hot, unable to look into the garden, standing on tiptoe at the north window, lying high and sleeping. Woke up and read Lu You's 'Records of Entering Shu'". Shiwei can be said to have read this book a hundred times, and his sincerity of love is truly unspeakable; as for the works of the people of the time, he fully expressed his dissatisfaction, and mentioned the same thing in "Xiao Xiao Diary" (Yi Hai): "September 23, reading "Quick Snow Hall Diary", spontaneous and unrestrained, with its own style. Others are more cautious, just like a maid learning from a lady, with shy and awkward gestures, and ultimately not natural. If the corner of the mouth is slightly stained with Wu dialect, it is like a prostitute in our family." He himself likes to write diaries, even becoming the main body of the complete works, which is, as he said in his collection, is love, is like planting flowers and trees, "it is the result of the nature of the part, and it cannot be stopped" (Gengwu, "Casual Records of Spring Floating Garden"). In fact, the diaries made by people of the time will not be as bad as he said in fact. Like Li Rihua's "Diary of the Weishui Pavilion," and Yuan Zhonglang's "Postscript to the Examination House," cannot be said to be bad articles. This is probably Shiwei's prejudice.</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>The main feature of Shiwei's diary is the realism of the life of a pastoral poet. The proportion of this in the entire diary is probably about three out of five. In his preface to "Casual Records of Spring Floating Garden" (Gengwu), he said: "In the three spring months, I am busy with the flowers and trees, working hard day and night, and I cannot rest. To accumulate the limited life with useless things, I think it is also too little. However, it is the result of the nature of the part, and it cannot be stopped. I am happy to live in the Xiao study in the summer, leisurely and happy. I wet the pen in the north and chat about the years, like a farmer's calendar for sunny and rainy days." As well as what is said in the "Preface to the Daily Records of Shenmu Hermitage": "I will follow what I like", all can explain the main tendency of his diary content. The formation of this tendency of his certainly has "what I like" at the same time as the following reason: "Literary talents and scholars, the killing intent at the tip of the pen and the tip of the tongue is the most hidden, and the calamity is the most long-lasting. I am strong-willed, and I blurt out whatever happens, like a catkin core in the throat, difficult to swallow. Occasionally, I endure it strongly, but every time I hurt the wind and move the qi, and it recurs, so the words in the record may involve slight thorns. They are all the signs of enduring to the extreme and erupting." Under the swords and axes, it is inevitable for those who are not brave enough to break through life and death and speak out for justice to take Shiwei's way of escape. It is still regrettable that, in Shiwei's diary, the so-called "slight thorns" are still very few. In comparison with the difficult life and angry feelings of the Ming loyalists reflected in "Daily Notes of Jiahang" (Ye Tianliao) and "Diary of Looking at Flowers" (Gui Zhuang), the difference is truly immeasurable. Rong and Gui's two notes cannot be written by anyone other than Ming loyalists, nor can they be placed in other eras, but Shiwei's diary can be used as a product of any era in feudal society, except for the different days. Ye and Gui's two notes have a very strong social significance. "Spring Floating Garden Diary" is nothing more than an ordinary record of personal life. The reason why it cannot become an extraordinary book is one of the reasons.</p>
<h3>At Dusk</h3>
<p>— Lin Xi</p>
<p>A flock of crows flies across the city wall,</p>
<p>In the small courtyard, the girl sings:</p>
<p>Old crow, old crow, close the city gate!</p>
<p>Gray dust chases the mule team,</p>
<p>The mules and horses roll with rattling sounds, far away.</p>
<p>They also long for rest!</p>
<p>Hurriedly,</p>
<p>Who are they all</p>
<p>Coming from the haze and going into the haze?</p>
<p>How? Hurriedly</p>
<p>No one pays attention to anyone?</p>
<p>Not coughing, not scratching?</p>
<p>Have you ever considered whether your feet are stepping on a flat ground?</p>
<p>A shadow,</p>
<p>丨丨 A tired ghost outside the gloomy forest?</p>
<p>Disappears outside the edge of the street lamp shadow. Look! Another one hurries to the lamp!</p>
<h3>Eugenie (2)</h3>
<p>— By Bai Wei</p>
<p>It was a cold winter night, and Xuan and Eugenie had returned from the dance hall. It was already past midnight. As usual, upon reaching her apartment, he kissed the back of her hand at her door, said goodnight, and each returned to their private rooms.</p>
<p>Xuan entered his room, took off his coat and scarf, and went to the closet to get his sleepwear. Suddenly, three apples caught his eye. He immediately went downstairs quietly again and knocked on Eugenie's door.</p>
<p>"Who's there?" Eugenie asked softly.</p>
<p>"It's me, Eugenie. Are you already in bed?"</p>
<p>"Not yet. But I've already changed into my sleepwear."</p>
<p>"Come upstairs quickly! I just remembered we have a few apples; let's eat them before we sleep."</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll be right there," Eugenie replied. Xuan returned to his room first, dimmed the lights, and pushed a small table to the bedside. The apples and a knife were prepared. He washed his hands.</p>
<p>Soon, Eugenie knocked and entered. She was wearing a long black velvet robe, her cheeks flushed red. This was the first time she had come to Xuan's room late at night.</p>
<p>"They're all asleep, I'm really afraid of waking them," she said, slightly breathless.</p>
<p>"It's alright," Xuan greeted her, and they sat side by side on the edge of the bed. Xuan faced the table, skillfully peeled the apple, giving a piece to Eugenie and a piece to himself. They ate and talked in turns.</p>
<p>"I don't want anymore, you eat more," she said. There was only one apple left on the table.</p>
<p>"I've had enough too," Xuan put down the knife, pushed the table away, then went to rinse his mouth and wash his hands, returning to sit close to Eugenie.</p>
<p>He put his right arm around her neck, his left hand around her waist, and their four red lips met. Eugenie also instinctively embraced him.</p>
<p>"Eugenie, you probably can't imagine how madly in love I am with you!"</p>
<p>"Really, since I met you, you've completely changed me!" she replied affectionately.</p>
<p>The clock struck once.</p>
<p>"I need to go back to my room," Eugenie said.</p>
<p>He was greedy for this moment of joy, afraid that Eugenie would go downstairs. He searched for a way to prolong this happiness. His eyes stared intently into hers. She saw the flames of love in Xuan's eyes and quickly closed her beautiful eyes, avoiding them, feeling somewhat lightheaded herself.</p>
<p>"Eugenie, you..."</p>
<p>Xuan didn't finish his sentence. Eugenie, as if shocked by a strong electric current, immediately broke free of Xuan's embrace, stood up, and tried to escape to the door. In an instant, Xuan's right hand pressed on her right shoulder from behind...</p>
<p>"Should you be so violent with me?" Eugenie said softly, with restraint.</p>
<p>"You should forgive me!"</p>
<p>Eugenie didn't answer.</p>
<p>And so, Xuan fell into happiness! At this moment, he realized the value of his twenty-four years of existence. Eugenie had enriched his life; Eugenie was his entire life! He used hundreds of different methods to make her happy and, from her happiness, found his own satisfaction! This foreign spring, this wonderful Paris, made this scarlet page in his history as perfect as possible.</p>
<p>As for Eugenie, although she was enjoying a mysterious joy, and although she loved this Eastern youth who worshipped her to the same degree, she couldn't be as crazy as Xuan! This diligent girl had another concern.</p>
<p>Under the light, Eugenie sat quietly, deep in thought.</p>
<p>"Eugenie, what are you thinking about?"</p>
<p>"Dear, I think, if we continue to live like this, it's going to be terrible!" she said hesitantly, watching Xuan's reaction.</p>
<p>"Terrible? The current life isn't enough for us to enjoy? Why worry about the terrible future!" Xuan was a presentist.</p>
<p>"Can there be another life that's more fulfilling than this?"</p>
<p>"Dear, you're too idealistic. We're so madly in love that we've forgotten all about important things. Have you thought about how much my studies have suffered since we met? My notes, lecture drafts, reference books, etc., you've made me so deficient that I don't even know how to catch up! And you, you've spent all your time on me!"</p>
<p>"Isn't our time being put to better use?"</p>
<p>"No, we must think about practical matters. The most pressing issue right now is that there are only two months until the exams. If I fail the exams, my father won't let me come to Paris next year. What if you love me even more then?"</p>
<p>"Then, what do you want to do?" Xuan couldn't refute her and asked in return. "We are already so madly in love!"</p>
<p>"After thinking it over, there's only one way: you move somewhere else," she said seriously.</p>
<p>"So you don't love me anymore?"</p>
<p>"On the contrary, I love you even more than before. If you don't listen to me, then you don't love me! I want you to move somewhere else, but only to reduce the amount of time you spend close to me. Before my exams, I want to stipulate that from Monday to Friday, from 6 PM to 7 PM, when I'm practicing the piano, you come and talk to me, and you leave before my dinner. From Saturday afternoon to Sunday afternoon, I'll let you control that day and a half completely. Besides that time, you have to let me read quietly. Do you accept my idea?"</p>
<p>"I'm not used to that!" Xuan said aggrievedly.</p>
<p>"Dear, you have to force yourself a little! Now there are two paths; please choose: either we continue to live like this, I fail the exams, and I'm left to study in my home country next year, or we live apart for now, enjoy each other in moderation, I work hard, pass both exams, and I return to Paris next year, and we live together again. You choose!"</p>
<p>"You must come back to Paris!"</p>
<p>"Since that's the case, I have one more method."</p>

<h3>Finance: Kwong Traders Buy to Cover; Gold Price Rises $5.30; Market Activity Lacking in the First Half of the Day</h3>
<p>The gold market was quite stable yesterday, with silver prices falling, and market sentiment improving. However, internal bank positions were not very tight, and news was slightly unfavorable. Although Kwong traders were buying to cover short positions, the situation in the first half of the day was quite challenging. Early in the morning, overseas silver markets in the UK and the US both fell, with the long-term silver price on the Five Metals Exchange falling between 1.5 and 5 cents. Exchange rates were flat, London raw gold rose by 1 penny, US cotton rose by 9 pounds, and US wheat rose by a little over 1 cent. Market sentiment was quite good, and prices rose immediately upon opening. However, they did not break through the $30 mark, as rumors of using silver to repay the June war bonds were widespread, causing sellers to be eager and prices to fall gradually. An Associated Press report stated that the President and silver proponents would meet tomorrow to discuss the silver plan, which should be finalized. It also stated that the President would agree to silver legislation within a narrower scope, etc. However, due to the drop in silver prices, the exchange market opened tight but was still able to rise. After that, internal positions did not tighten but showed signs of loosening, and the market seemed uncertain, causing gold prices to hesitate and fluctuate. Later, Kwong traders worked hard to cover short positions, and market sentiment was normal. Therefore, although prices rose, they still fell, and the struggle was intense. An electronic dispatch reported that President Roosevelt had proposed to the Treasury Department a $1.322 billion aid package for rural areas, which did not have a significant impact. However, it happened to coincide with the initial misreporting of the rise in the silver price on the Seattle night market by 1.125 and 0.5 cents, causing a temporary drop. When a Reuters dispatch then corrected the report, stating that the silver price on the Seattle night market had actually shrunk by 1.125 and 0.25 cents, Kwong traders entered again, and prices held firm. However, the supply still poured in, and the noon market was flat. The estimated price of pure gold was $1043, and the backwardation fell from over $2 to $0.4, a very cheap trend. The market situation for the first half of the day is recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was at $1029, an increase of $7.50 compared to the previous close (excluding backwardation). Spot opening was at $8. Official exchange rates opened with the recent selling price for British exchange at 1 shilling, 3 pence and 0.25, and for US exchange at $32.50. Fook Cheong, Fook On, Cheng Cheong, Yuan Cheong, Wing Kin, Cheung Yuen, Cheung Cheong, Yuen Mao, Wing Tai, Tak Shing, Ting Tai, Hang Tai and others sold, gradually retreating from $30 to $4.5. Fook Cheong and Fook Yue took advantage of the low prices to buy, rising to $6.8. Yuan Chun, Tak Shing, Yee Fung, and Wing sold off, predicting that the official British rate would be flat and the US rate would rise by 1.125, then falling to $3.5. Citibank and Shanghai closed half a dollar on the May US dollar. Tak Shing, Fook Hing, Wing Kin, Cheung Yuen, Cheung Cheong, Yuen Mao, Wing Fook Cheong, Siu Fung Cheong, and others bought continuously. HSBC repeatedly cleared half a dollar on the May US dollar, rising to $9.3. Macgary and Cheng Kin closed 5.5625 on the June US dollar. Wing Fung and Fook Hing Wing sold notes, falling to $6.2. However, because Hang Hing, Yuan Mao, Wing Hing Fat Wing, and others continued to buy, the price was pushed up to $9.2. Hang Hing, Tak Lien, Kwong, Fook Hing, and Wing sold off, falling again to $6.2. Hang Hing entered the market aggressively to cover, rising to $7.5. However, retail investors exerted downward pressure. The misreported rise in the silver price on the Seattle night market by 1.125 and 0.5 cents caused Tak Shing and Yee Fung Wing to sell to $4. However, Reuters corrected the report, stating that the silver price on the Seattle night market had actually fallen by 1.125, which boosted market sentiment, and Kwong traders bought aggressively. Tak Shing also bought, and the price rose to $9. Retail investors offered notes, causing the price to fall again. However, Hang Hing, Fook Hing Wing, Yue Hing Wing continued to buy, rising from $6.5 to $8.4. Finally, Yee Fung, Wing Kin, Cheung Yuen, Yuen Mao, Wing sold off, although Yue Hing Wing bought. The noon closing fell to $1026.8, and spot trading closed at $5. After the close, Yuan Mao Wing and others sold off, falling to within $5. The highest price during the first half of the day was $1030, and the lowest price was $1023.5, a fluctuation of $6.5. As a result, the previous close was $5.3 better. If the backwardation difference of $1 is added, the increase would be a strong $6.</p>
<p>The closing price, according to HSBC's US exchange rate listing, rose by 1.125 to $32, equivalent to a standard gold price of $1081. According to the closing price, the premium was about $54, a decrease of over $9 compared to the previous close. The book entry for this month was $1029, for June $1028, and for July $1027. The afternoon make-up water was $1029, and the price of pure gold was $1043. The raw gold market was quiet, and customer traders showed little activity. Generally, the selling price was about $15 more, and the buying price was about $14 more, considering a backwardation of around $1. In the first half of the day, Tak Shing sold only 700 taels to Ying Fung Hang, adding $15, which was an internal settling transaction within Ying Fung Hang. Today's public orders released include 49 notes each from Ying Fung Hang and Ting Tai, and 7 notes from Tak Shing. Those taken in include 49 notes each from Yuan Yat and Kin Cheung Cheung, and 7 notes from Cheung Shing Wing. The opening backwardation for this term was initially offered by retail investors at $1.5, gradually rising to $2.3. Ying Fung Hang, Yuan Mao Wing, Tak Lien Kwong, and others offered aggressively, gradually falling until it retreated to within $1. Shun Mao, Tak Shing, and Chun Yuen Wing offered $0.5 to Tak Cheung Cheung and others. In addition, Tak Shing offered 84 notes to Shun Lee for $0.4. As of today, there are still 637 notes remaining in May, with a total of three long positions and four short positions.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was still active. Kwong traders covering short positions included Hang Hing, Sang Tai, Yuan Mao Wing (assigned over 2000 to Sang Tai), Hang Yue, Shen Hong, Yue Hing Wing, Wing Tak, Shui Hong, Hang Hing Yuen, Tung Tai Cheung, Hing Fat Wing, Siu Fung Cheong, Tai Fat Wing, and Fook Cheong, etc., who were on the buying side. Wan Hing, Shun Lee, Fook Hing Wing, Yee Fung Wing, Wing Fung, Wai Cheung, Tung Chun, Kin Cheung Cheung, Yuan Chun, Tai Cheung Cheung, Ting Tai, and Hang Tai Cheng Cheong etc. were on the selling side. Fook Cheong and Fook On, Tak Shing, Yuan Heng, Yik Shing, and others first sold and then bought. Tai Hing Wing, Fook Yue, Kin Cheung Cheung first bought and then sold. Tak Lien Kwong and Shun Lee traded a total of over 2500 notes, clearing over 500 notes. Wan Hing traded a total of just under 1100 notes, clearing over 600 notes. Hang Hing, a Kwong trader, entered over 1300 notes, selling over 100 notes. Sang Tai entered over 300 notes but entered and transferred under other numbers, totaling over 2500 notes, already reversing to be over 800 notes long. As for June notes not yet closed, the long positions include over 900 notes for Wan Hing, over 800 notes for Hang Yue, over 600 notes for Fook Yue, over 500 each for Ting Tai and Tak Shing, over 300 for Ying Fung Hang, and over 200 each for Yuan Mao Wing, Yik Shing, Wai Yuen, Fook Hing Wing, and Chun Yuen Wing. The short positions include over 3900 notes for Kin Cheung Cheung, over 600 notes each for Yuan Yat and Ting Hong, over 400 for Yik Yue, over 200 for Tai Fung Hang, and other scattered notes.

The sellers include over 2900 notes for Kin Cheung Cheung, over 2000 for Cheng Cheong, over 1500 for Sum Cheung Wing, over 1400 for Tak Tak Heung, over 1300 each for Yik Shing Guang Yat, Shui Hing Yue Yuen Tian Fung Bing. over 700 each, over 600 for Tung Chun, over 500 for Yuan Mao Wing, and over 400 each for Fook Yue and Yuan Fung Wing. As of today, the total number of counters is 23,128 notes, or 23,121 notes, of which 7 notes have not yet been verified, with a total of 38 long positions and 55 short positions.</p>
<h3>Silver Price Drops; Exchange Market Tightens</h3>
<p>According to London's reports, the recent and long-term prices both contracted by 1.875, and the US silver price fell by 1.125. The long-term silver price contracted by 3.1 cents.

HSBC's listing revealed that the British rate was flat and the US rate rose by 1.125. After this, HSBC aggressively took in spot US dollars, slightly tightening the rate. However, banks were also eager to offer, and market sentiment was not buoyant. Unfavorable rumors circulated, and the market situation remained flat. Later, the night market silver price reported a rise of 1.125, which was then corrected as a mistake of contraction of 1.125. The process was flat and uncertain.

<h3>Financial Market Remains Dull</h3>
<p>Foreign Call Money Settles at 6%; Dull Liquidation</p>
<p>Yesterday, the financial market remained extremely sluggish, showing no signs of improvement. The foreign call money market rate, although increased by one cent compared to the previous day, was 6 cents for both the morning and afternoon markets. However, this slight fluctuation is a common occurrence in the market. Call money plus water was still open at 2 cents, which, although slightly better than plain call money, was not enough to make a difference. The transaction volume of call money bills was over 4.3 million in the morning market and over 400,000 in the afternoon market. The transaction volume in the Small General Association was over 300,000. The bank settlements were similar to the past few days, remaining scattered and unremarkable. Foreign banks settled over 2.5 million in bill payments, over 3.8 million in various goods exchange collateral miscellaneous settlements, over 800,000 in foreign exchange settlements, and 400,000 in warehouse withdrawals. Chinese banks settled over 2.6 million in bill payments, over 4.3 million in various goods exchange collateral miscellaneous settlements, over 300,000 in telegraphic transfers, over 400,000 in customs duties, and 700,000 in warehouse withdrawals. Japanese banks settled over 2.3 million in bill payments, over 4.8 million in various goods exchange collateral miscellaneous settlements, and 400,000 in warehouse entries. Money shops settled over 41 million in public single foreign currency, over 4.8 million in foreign call money plus water, over 400,000 in various provincial exchange remittances, over 600,000 in cash receipts, over 200,000 in foreign currency pledge transactions and redemptions, over 800,000 in new transactions, over 700,000 in banknote withdrawals, over 1.4 million in banknote issues, 200,000 in customer sources, and 250,000 in expenditures. The total exchange volume of the clearing house in this city on the 16th was 8,007,144.18 silver dollars, including 5,001,650.24 silver dollars in silver dollars, and 3,005,539.94 silver dollars in exchange and drafts.</p>
<h3>Small Coins Fall; Copper Coins Strengthen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of Kiangnan small coins was 836 dollars for both the morning and afternoon markets, a decrease of 2 dollars compared to the previous day. The transaction volume was 8,500 small coins in the morning market and 4,000 small coins in the afternoon market. The price of Kwangtung small coins continued to fall, with the morning market at 738.3 dollars and the afternoon market at 738.5 dollars, a further decrease of 2 dollars compared to the previous day. The transaction volume was 65,000 small coins in the morning market and 65,000 small coins in the afternoon market. The copper coin market strengthened by 5,000 compared to the previous day due to a shortage of underlying goods, with few sellers and many buyers. The morning and afternoon markets were both 335,000, with a transaction value of 36,180 strings, equivalent to 10,800 foreign dollars.</p>
<h3>Securities: Northern Traders Slightly Increase Position; Market Lingers at a Slightly Higher Level</h3>
<p>The trend in the market at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange yesterday still did not break out of its hovering state. However, due to weakness following a slight strengthening, the market has either risen or fallen slightly for several days. The market price hovers and brews around the same level, and is still unable to jump out of its original confines. It can be said that the extent of the hover is exhaustive. There is no so-called rise or fall on the table. Occasionally, due to slight differences in the supply and demand of counters, there are slight differences in height, showing a dull situation. The main reason is that the big short positions are not covered, and the long positions firmly hold the market price. The rise and fall depend on the retail entrance and exit for the changes. Yesterday's market price was firm in the first session in the morning, which was still consistent. Except that more demand was needed for No. 47, the rest were nothing more than backwardation transactions. The market price was slightly better at two or three corners. The second session immediately showed a hovering state of varying heights. However, because of a slight increase in appetite among northern traders, the proportion of rises was relatively high, and the proportion of declines was small. The situation in the afternoon two sessions was roughly the same. The increase in one was the decrease in the other. It was impossible to achieve consistency. The trend was slightly stronger. It is feared that the future is still unable to see quick flexibility. The market price results show that the increase ranged from 12 cents to 45 cents. The total volume was 6,753,000 yuan of spot goods. The comparison table of the rising and falling results is listed on the left (unit yuan, transaction unit 100 yuan):</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Steady and Firm</h3>
<p>New Fung &amp; Co. reports: Yesterday (the 15th), the New York stock market was steady and firm due to the government's concentrated efforts in industrial recovery.

High-grade bonds and U.S. government bonds received little attention regarding price differences. Grains rose, reportedly due to insufficient rainfall to alleviate the drought.

<h3>Yarn and Cloth: Selling Pressure Still Shrouds Standard Yarn</h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to be weak and soft. According to market rumors, there are reports of two yarn factories delivering 8,000 bales of yarn this month. At the same time, selling pressure remains heavy, so the market is depressed. However, there is more spot yarn business. A total of 1,100 bales were traded throughout the day. Afternoon prices were stabilized. In general, it does not escape the pattern of consolidation.</p>
<h3>Golden Rooster Continues to Decline</h3>
<p>The standard yarn market opened higher in the morning due to slight gains in the U.S. and Indian cotton markets, but there were very few buyers in the market. Near-month contracts fell 7 jiao to 1.1 yuan, and far-month contracts fell 3 to 4 jiao. In the afternoon, it was reported that spot yarn sales were still brisk, and each month recovered 1 to 2 jiao. The total trading volume for the day was 25,800 bales. It was found that Chun Kee sold 750 bales, Da Fung 450 bales, Wai Hong 600 bales, Keng Fung 1,550 bales, Chang Fung 800 bales, Hip Sang 1,400 bales, and Kam Cheung 500 bales.

<p>Inland 85 Jinan 280 Shantou 30 Ningbo 2 Henan 302 Zhenjiang 10 Guangdong 400 Nanjing 5</p>
<h3>Standard Cotton Bulls Slightly Emerging</h3>
<p>The cotton market is slightly weak, while overseas cotton markets are slightly higher. Some bulls in this port have emerged, and the market has fallen. However, major buyers have not yet released their positions. The idea of a short squeeze has not been abandoned, so the May and June contracts are quite tight, and the far months are slightly loose. According to another source, Japanese bulls are also said to be closing positions.</p>
<h3>Cheng Cotton Slightly Soft</h3>
<p>The standard cotton market opened quite firm in the morning, with prices rising by 1-2 jiao in each month. It suddenly fell after the second and third rounds of bidding. As a result, each month fell by 5 fen to 1 jiao. It remained flat in the afternoon, with prices rising and falling by 5 fen in each month. The total trading volume for the day was 83,500 dan. It was found that Chun Kee sold 3,200 dan, Wai Hong 4,100 dan, Keng Fung 4,800 dan, Yan Fung 4,700 dan, Li Heng 3,700 dan, Fook Yuen 4,400 dan, Cheung Wo 4,800 dan, Shun Cheung 1,600 dan, and Cheung Fung 2,100 dan.

<h3>Factory Demand is Very Brisk</h3>
<p>Spot cotton sales are active again, with all factories replenishing their stocks. The sources include 556 bales of Yao cotton and 1,200 bales of Tong cotton. The spot cotton prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Fire Engine Cotton 39.50 Yong An Factory purchased 500 bales of spot goods for delivery to the factory.</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton 42.75 Hong Cheung Factory purchased 116 pieces.</p>
<p>Tianjin American Cotton 47.75 Chun Shin Factory purchased 100 pieces.</p>
<p>Also 47.50 Hong Cheung Factory purchased 173 pieces.</p>

<p>Shaanxi Cotton 42.25 Also 300 pieces.</p>
<p>Zhengzhou Cotton 44.00 Also 174 pieces.</p>
<h3>Main Reasons for the Decline in Standard Yarn in the Past Two Days</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market in this port has turned downward in the past two days. The reasons for its weakness are briefly described as follows: (1) Purchases in North China have been very strong for several days, and recent replenishments have been saturated. In addition, due to poor conditions, there are still more than 30,000 bales of chips in the warehouse. According to market sources, Yong An Factory and Chun Shin Factory have a total of 8,000 bales to be delivered in May, so actual sales are slightly sluggish. Speculators are also actively selling, and foreign merchants are also selling in large quantities, putting heavy pressure on the market, so the market has fallen sharply. However, cotton prices have become inversely proportional, pushing towards higher peaks day by day, making it increasingly difficult for factories to calculate costs. (2) Due to the era of old cotton, sources from all routes are depleted, and Shanghai's inventory is thin. Foreign merchants absorb it, and although overseas cotton markets are flat and weak, the calculated price is still higher than Chinese cotton, making it impossible to adjust shipments to Shanghai. As a result, the price difference between yarn and cotton is widening, and manufacturers are falling into a tragic situation. The recent high and low prices of standard yarn and cotton are recorded below:</p>
<p>May Futures Standard Yarn May 8th Highest Price 173.40 yuan April 18th Lowest Price 167.40 yuan</p>
<p>May Futures Standard Cotton May 15th Highest Price 43.70 yuan April 10th Lowest Price 40.07 yuan</p>
<p>Judging from the above situation, the suffering of expensive cotton and cheap yarn is becoming more and more difficult. Yesterday's closing price for May futures was 169.70 yuan, only 2.50 yuan higher than the low price. The closing price for May futures cotton was 43.15 yuan, 2.45 yuan higher than the low price. Therefore, manufacturers have once again proposed the idea of reducing wages, and the yarn industry is entering a more difficult path. However, it is found that in these two weeks, about 20,000 to 30,000 bales have been purchased, transported, and exported by South China, North China, and various groups, and the factory's inventory has been reduced a lot. Japanese merchants have also shipped more than 10,000 bales of Japanese yarn and cloth to India and Japan recently, so the price of Japanese yarn is gradually increasing, averaging 4-5 yuan higher than Chinese yarn. In this case, this yarn should not fall sharply. The market prices of Chinese yarn and Japanese yarn yesterday are copied below:</p>
<p>May 16th Chinese Yarn Market Price May 16th Japanese Yarn Market Price 42s Man Chung 269.00 42s Yang Ho 274.00</p>

<h3>Overseas Cotton Market Has Not Improved Much</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market was sluggish and unremarkable. Peers took a wait-and-see attitude. As a result, spot goods rose by 5 points, and futures rose by 7 to 9 points. Liverpool cotton futures rose by 3 points, and Egyptian cotton futures fell by 2 points. The Bombay cotton market initially rose due to purchases by speculators, but later weakened as some bulls closed their positions. As a result, Pingar rose by 3 rupees, Oomra rose by 2 rupees, and Baroshi rose by 2 rupees and 2.5 annas. The original telegram is recorded on the left: (Telegram on the 15th) U.S. Cotton Compared to the previous day National Currency British Cotton Compared to the previous day National Currency</p>

<h3>Grains: Wavering and Uncertain Futures Flour</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning, showed good signs in each month. With overseas wheat quotations, Chicago rose by about 3 to 4 jiao. Therefore, when opening prices, the market sentiment has been rising. Later, due to the tight pace of rice prices by inland groups and customers in this street, buying sentiment was active. Due to the delivery relationship, the near-term increase was only 1 fen. The long-term was raised by about 2 fen due to external purchases. However, actual sales groups still watched more, so although the environment was slightly strong, over-increase was very difficult. By the time of the afternoon opening, a weak sign has appeared. It is said that Tianjin's spot flour has fallen back by 2 fen. The old wheat of the Jinpu Railway and the Longhai Railway will naturally surge, and the selling price is also cheap. According to Tianjin groups, the cost of flour production in the area is only between 1.70 and 8 jiao yuan. Shen flour sales are not smooth, which should be related to this. Therefore, after the opening price, it became loose again, falling back by 1 to 2 fen compared to the morning. As a result, this month to August was good for 2.5 li, September fell by 5 li instead, and October remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>期Wheat Gains Are Still Peaceful</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market, after opening in the morning, the markets for each month showed a firm trend. With overseas wheat quotations, Chicago rose by 3 to 4 jiao, Canada did not move. Market sentiment in recent days is due to the high price of rice, and the soybean industry is unusually strong. Therefore, the selling sentiment has turned less, and the market is easy to rise. It is said that the inland groups in Suzhou also purchased one or twenty cars in the long term, so the market price was easily raised. By the time of the afternoon opening, the trend has been peaceful, and both buyers and sellers are smooth. According to the speculation of industry insiders, it is believed that the old wheat in each road is still thick, and the new wheat is about to enter the market, so there is little hope for the future. The fact that June has been flat from beginning to end shows that there are still problems. As a result, June was good for 2 fen, July was good for 4 fen, August was good for 1 fen, and September was good for 5 fen. The spot wheat market is still flat and soft. Due to the still abundant bottom inventory, old goods arrive and connect, and factory needs are only dealt with, so it is difficult to shake people's hearts. Opening Dangshan wheat at 3 yuan, Wuhe wheat at 2 yuan 9 jiao 2 fen, Yaowan wheat at 2 yuan 9 jiao 5 fen, Yingzhou wheat at 2 yuan 9 jiao 5 fen, second 9 jiao, Nansuzhou wheat at 2 yuan 9 jiao 7 fen, a total of 3,000 bags, handled by Fuxin.</p>
<h3>河下米Is A Sign Of垂Soft</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Each group's sources are slightly more, a total of more than 40 numbers (more than 6,000 stones). Thick and thin each account for about half. Zero and wholesale both suddenly turned slack. The initial market seemed to have a downward trend. Until after, there were few customers in this street, and they were also watching, and transactions became more and more deserted, showing a soft sign. The differences between medium and low grade 苏同帮粳 are gradually becoming clear, and the goods such as 常帮南港 are each going downstream. Until the close of the market, the overall market was down 1-2 jiao. At the same time, the late rice bag stock was still only being moved by 北洋帮续千二百三百 bags. 青角, 枫练, 泗涇 and other goods were all stable. As for 杜洋尖 and 阴变元, each color has a tired color.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 30 ships arrived from 河下 and inland routes. The sales and stocks of each goods in the market, 白粳, 白元, 羊尖杜, and 尖 客, were all very deserted. Transactions were as rare as stars in the morning. Only the thin rice and early rice with less goods were selling well. The market situation was that high-quality 白粳 was stable, and medium and low grade prices fell by 1-2 jiao. 白元 also fell by 1-2 jiao. 羊埠客尖 price was slightly better. 杜尖 high-quality goods were stable, and medium and low grade were tired. Early thin rice price was raised by 1-2 jiao.</p>
<h3>客糙And 洋米Continue To Increase By 2 Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday's 客秈 market, taking advantage of the continued surge in momentum, the market sentiment was very good. All parties unanimously bullish, and the owners continued to call higher prices. However, after several days of soaring, the number of arrivals in various places gradually increased. Yesterday, nearly 10,000 bags of newly arrived 客秈 from various routes, especially 机制客秈. After several days of smooth sales, this street suddenly stopped to wait and see, and there was still a large batch of goods in transit that could arrive. Therefore, the market has a tendency to turn flat. However, yesterday, 浙省绍甬 inland groups and 闽省 competed for the business. 浙帮注意小绞 and 糙米, so 小绞 reached 7.8 yuan, and 糙米 rose to 7.3 yuan, each 2 jiao higher than the previous market. 机制米等 followed the good jiao, and the transaction was also the most 糙米. It is estimated that 糙湖南糙 and other products totaled more than 8,000 bags, 小绞 opened 6,000 bags, and 机制米 from various routes was around 3,500 bags. The total is still more than 17,500 bags. Therefore, although there are many arrivals, and this street has stopped, the market continues to rise. However, industry insiders believe that after several days of soaring, it will inevitably lead to a large number of arrivals, and the future market may turn stable.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: White Tung Oil Rising Wind Slightly Halted</h3>
<p>Since the previous week, tung oil has seen another state of turmoil. The 洋庄 in Han City rose from 27.6 yuan to 29.6 yuan. The Han City Bank has announced that it will not sell unless it reaches 30 yuan. However, each 洋行 happened to make up the vacancies at this time, and the subsequent delivery may be slow. Therefore, the 洋行 transactions suddenly stopped last week, and the market also stabilized. Moreover, according to recent news, Changde has already fallen by 1 yuan, and Han City cannot avoid being affected. The 洋行 means that 28 yuan and some odd is still available, but the Han Bank believes that although Changde said that prices have fallen, there are still few goods arriving in Han City, and the bank's bottom stock is still thin, so the price drop seems to be unwilling. Therefore, they have been holding each other for days without any transactions. The bankers have increased the advance price of Xiangtung to 24.5-6 yuan. Although the 洋交 has temporarily stopped, the 客货 is still unwilling to sell cheaply, so the bankers are not willing to recognize the decline. In short, the output of this year is reduced, and the market after will always be easy to rise and difficult to fall. Even if the 洋行 holds each other and does not handle it, if there are many transactions, it will still have to increase. Because the source is not surging, the foundation is exceptionally solid. Zhetung, in view of the soaring of Han City, echoed the sentiment was in the original intention. Last week, when the rumors were the tightest, they still called for 27 yuan per cwt. But the inland sales market was depressed, and the 本埠号家 had a slight stock, and they all wanted to temporarily avoid its edge, so there was no transaction. I soon learned of the news of the 洋交 stop in Han City, and the Hangzhou market also gradually loosened and fell. Yesterday, the Hangzhou bank sent a friend to Shanghai and has loosened 25 yuan. If there is a transaction, it may be willing to lower another 2-3 yuan. The current market rising wind has halted, and it should be stable at times. If you want to return to loose, it is not easy to do.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Red and Green Tea Transactions Are Still Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market of 洋庄 in this port, the 红绿茶 from both 沮州 and 土庄, and the 厚, 协和, 锦隆 and other banks in 英庄 were eager to buy. A total of more than 700 boxes were transacted in the city, and the transactions were quite strong. However, the selling price of red tea was exceptionally hard, and green tea also did not change. The new 毛茶 from 遂安, 湖州, 天潼 and other routes have been successively shipped to Shanghai, no less than a thousand bags. Each tea factory has been working day and night to rush production to meet the needs of foreign merchants.</p>
<h3>赣浙茶訉Consolidated Report</h3>
<p>修水 Tea 出嫩头 The 红茶 with the words 头字 in 修水, 武宁, and 铜鼓 has always been opened before the beginning of summer. This year, due to the cold weather, the development of tea buds is very slow. Recently, the weather has turned warm, and the seedlings are sprouting. Each number is based on the fact that the mountain households are picking late in the year, and the tea body is old and inferior, which has been abandoned by foreign merchants. Therefore, taking advantage of the early sprouting of the new Feng, they urge the mountain households to start picking early. Before this week, the weather was sunny, which was conducive to picking and drying, and the shipments were quite good. The tea houses stationed in Xiushui are brave in searching for them. The first tea has been mostly stocked. It has begun to be screened and baked. The mountain price opened at 50 yuan to more than 30 yuan, with no increase or decrease from the previous year. It is now buying two or three words, and the market will look lower than before.</p>
<p>浙东青茶出新 This week, due to the sudden hot weather and sudden changes in sunny and rainy weather, the new tea in 浙东龙游, 开化, 江山, and 华埠 can be picked early. Each mountain household has hired workers to open the garden and bake it on the market. The quality of the goods is good. However, the development of tea buds this year is uneven due to climate and soil damage. The tea output is not booming. The local tea vendors and merchants are carrying money to the mountains to search for them. The tender head tea is negotiated between 60 yuan and 70 yuan, which is more than 10 yuan lower than last year.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sliced Blue Sugar Rises By 2 Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market, with 关金 falling sharply, the trend was stable. The association's divided price of 24 coarse sand white was 20 yuan and 9 jiao 8 fen, up 2 fen from the previous day. This station's goods called 21 yuan and 8 fen. The original price of 89-号 Dutch red and 太古B marks did not rise or fall. 振记一号 本锦白 was still 19 yuan and 3 jiao, and the lower grades were extremely tired. The miscellaneous brand heart white was only 17 yuan and 6-7 jiao. There were 400 bags of 国产糖 黄岗青 opened by the 潮帮号家, the price was 11 yuan and 8 jiao to 8 jiao, and more than 100 bags of 高枝赤 were opened, the price was 13 yuan and 6 jiao to 4 jiao, the second was 13 yuan and 2 jiao to 11 yuan. More than 100 pieces of 片青 opened by the 广帮号家, the price was 9 yuan and 2 jiao, up 2 jiao from before.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: High-Grade Orchid Seeds Have Been Sold Out</h3>
<p>The orchid seeds have not continued to arrive in the past few days. The market stock is extremely thin, and the high-quality goods are even more scarce. Therefore, the good goods with all yellow and no sand particles are sold to 48 yuan in the market, and the business has been sold out. Although the number of ordinary goods in stock is small, the 号货 has not been opened because it does not meet the sales needs. The current market price of 33-4 yuan is also less sought after.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Thin Tinplate is Shipped By Tobacco Factories</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a large tobacco company in 本埠 urgently needed 200 boxes of 35-pound thin tinplate. Because the spot goods on the market were not thick, they entrusted brokers to search for them. It is said that they have searched for the number, but the market has gradually increased as a result. For example, the initial asking price was 51-2 yuan per box, and it has been successively added to 54-5 yuan. At present, some holders of the goods are even asking for 60 yuan, so the market is quite sharp.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>The Abolition of the Concubine System</h3>
<p>— Xuefei</p>
<p>Recently, it was reported that the new law being revised by the Legislative Yuan stipulates that concubinage is strictly prohibited, and violators will be prosecuted for adultery. This new criminal law will be promulgated soon. This is a major reform in our country's new law. The concubinage issue that Chinese women's circles have been fighting for for several years has finally been resolved to a considerable extent.</p>
<p>Concubinage is a very backward system that can only exist in feudal societies. Although China is not exactly a capitalist society now, it has also broken away from the feudal shell. The concubine system should no longer exist in this society. And the abolition of the concubine system was not implemented until today. Mr. Sun Yat-sen stipulated in his handwritten Outline of Founding the Country that men and women are equal (this is the basis for the new law's strict prohibition of concubinage), and the most important obstacle that makes men and women unequal was not removed until today. From this point, we can also know how laws always fall behind the times.</p>
<p>Concubinage is not only an insult to women, but also a destruction of women. Women should have been actively walking into society, doing social activities like men. But now they are imprisoned in the "golden houses" of the rich, and are used as playthings by a few people. A "concubine" is actually equivalent to a cat or a dog. Society is also like there is no such person, because she never has a relationship with society, but is just a parasite. There are at least tens of millions of people in China who keep concubines. How great a loss should this fine calculation be?</p>
<p>Now, the concubine system is finally abolished in law. However, whether women can be liberated from this, and whether they can become people in society as a result, is still somewhat questionable.</p>
<p>First, we know that the reason why the concubine system is bad is first because it treats women as playthings. However, treating women as playthings can be implemented not necessarily under the name of "concubine". In fact, there are many women who are not concubines in name, but are actually equivalent to concubines, and are treated as playthings by men in the same way. In this way, if the fundamental weakness of being treated as playthings by men is not changed, even if the name of concubine is abolished, what practical benefits will it have for the future of women? Therefore, I believe that although the name of concubine has been abolished, the truly equal status of women will not be easily obtained because of this. True equality, true women's liberation, still requires women to work hard on their own. Otherwise, I am afraid that the result will still be empty.</p>
<p>Second, although the name of concubine has been abolished in law, can the effectiveness of the law really prohibit everyone from taking concubines? Laws are fundamentally designed for the rich, and the rich can find ways to circumvent all legal constraints (this is actually the case). In this situation, how can this law be applied to everyone without hindrance? This is also a question that should be studied.</p>
<p>In addition, concubinage is mostly practiced by the rich, especially high-ranking officials and nobles. Therefore, the abolition of concubinage should start with high-ranking officials and nobles, and then extend to the general public. Secondly, for those who practice concubinage in other names, that is, who have the reality of concubinage but avoid the name of concubinage, how should they be punished? It seems that there should also be a regulation. These, although not important joints in this issue, are also worthy of incidental discussion.</p>
<h3>"Lust" and "Food"</h3>
<p>— He Juefu</p>
<p>"Eating and lusting are human nature." Both are necessary conditions for human life. Because they are necessary for human life, engaging in business related to these aspects can yield a substantial profit.</p>
<p>We should remember the once sensational sex history theories of a certain doctor a few years ago. At that time, I was studying in the countryside, but this trend had already penetrated the rural areas: almost every young student with a bit of sexual drive had a copy in hand to show off their fashion, and even in the desks or under the pillows of traditionally shy young women, one or two copies could sometimes be found. If the situation was like this in the remote countryside, then it can be imagined what it was like in bustling cities. This book's appeal was so great, its sales were so widespread: then, the author's large income was naturally expected.</p>
<p>However, in our 'Land of Propriety', China, matters of sex between men and women have always been regarded as obscene and lowly. Not only can such words not be found in the classics of history, but even those who understand the basic principles would disdain to discuss them. In such a country, the sudden public discussion of sex would certainly be enthusiastically welcomed by a group of young men and women suppressed under the etiquette of 'men and women not touching hands': but, encountering the opposition of the 'old' forces in society was also unavoidable. Therefore, the result was not only the banning of the books, but also our poor doctor had to abandon his armor and flee.</p>
<p>Several years have slipped by unnoticed. Our doctor has perhaps deeply realized that this path is impassable in our ancient country, so our doctor, relying on the intelligence of a doctor, simply stopped talking about these things and turned to another human instinct: food.</p>
<p>What exactly does this 'Food Classic', which cost the doctor so much effort, say? Before seeing the whole picture, I dare not speculate out of thin air; however, if judging by the name is not wrong, it should be like the previous sex history, aiming to correct people's improper and unreasonable eating habits? (In the short preface of several hundred words, that is all he says.) How this book will benefit or harm the human world is beyond my concern: but, since food is necessary for human life, the selection and methods of eating are naturally what everyone wants to hear; and, this is also a type of book without any taboos, and a large income is very hopeful.</p>
<p>From the study of 'lust' to a sudden turn to 'food', this is probably what makes the doctor a doctor!</p>
<h3>Some Thoughts After Seeing "Medical Experiment on the Human Body"</h3>
<p>— Guanghan</p>
<p>This "Medical Experiment on the Human Body" begins with pictures illustrating the structure and function of various parts inside the human body, the combination of sperm and egg after intercourse between men and women, and the process of fetal development during the ten months of pregnancy. Then, it actually shows the state of a pregnant woman during childbirth. There is normal delivery and difficult delivery. Normal delivery is very easy, and the fetus lands in an instant. Difficult delivery is very troublesome and requires surgery. Some only need the help of obstetrical instruments, while others cannot succeed without a cesarean section. We often only hear that childbirth for women is an extremely difficult thing, but we don't know to what extent it is difficult. Only after seeing it with our own eyes do we know that when a woman is about to give birth, normal delivery is not too unbearable, but if she is unlucky enough to encounter a difficult delivery, the painful situation is beyond words, and the life of the parturient woman can be said to be at the crossroads of life and death. It also instructs us on the various health precautions that pregnant women should take before delivery, and the proper methods for handling infants after they are born.</p>
<p>This is a film taken on-site in an obstetrics hospital, and its content has scientific and educational implications, and it is worth seeing. This type of film is not uncommon in foreign countries, and the educational authorities often use it as a tool for social education to promote and instill new and useful knowledge to the public. We sincerely hope that we can see such films in our country from time to time to supplement the deficiencies in social education.</p>
<p>However, our country is indeed a country with 'special national conditions'. No matter what foreign things come to our country, they will change their nature and function. 'Public socializing' or 'free love' is extremely natural between men and women in Europe and the United States, but once introduced into our country, it is ruined, and is often misused by young people as an excuse for 'flirting' or 'meeting secretly', and is cited as an object of attack by a group of moralists. The meaning of 'modern' is also very profound, but the clever Chinese people will interpret it as 'fashionable' and compete to admire it. Just like this film "Medical Experiment on the Human Body", it is promoted as a tool for social education in foreign countries, but once it is</p>

<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>imported into our country, it is regarded by filmmakers as a treasure for 'making money' and used as a sexy film to attract audiences. We only need to read the film's large advertisement, which says things like 'no concealment', 'maximum exposure', 'complete disclosure', 'nakedly letting the audience enjoy', and other fleshy, seductive words, and it is not difficult to understand their intentions. As for the general audience rushing to it, paying the price of thirty cents to enjoy it, apart from a very small number of people, it is nothing more than holding a curious mentality, wanting to obtain temporary stimulation on the mystery of sex, as a consolation to quench their thirst, and they don't have any intention of absorbing physiological knowledge. When countless spectators in the theater see a 'wonderful' scene unfolding on the white screen, don't they all make an unbearable strange sound and shout frantically? It's really a strange phenomenon!</p>
<p>Recently, fragrant and sensual films in Chinese society do have a great power that can make audiences turn upside down. The most popular films in Shanghai theaters are not "Don Quixote" or "Gold Mountain", but "42nd Street" and "Warm Spring in Huaqing". "Healthy Women" and "Back to Nature" are even more infinitely tempting. In addition, the characters on the screen, although they can talk and walk, and their naked bodies are also exceptionally realistic, which can make people's emotions tense for a while, but after all, they are dead things, and it is difficult to fully satisfy the audience's desires. It is not as good as the living beauties on the stage, whose 'trembling breasts' and 'swaying fat buttocks' in the grass skirt dance are enough to make people obsessed! Now, in addition to showing sensual films, aren't various nude song and dance performances also popular in local theaters? This is to meet the needs of society!</p>
<p>So I understand the origin of this "Medical Experiment on the Human Body", which contains scientific and educational significance, which was shown in a Japanese cinema on North Sichuan Road a few years ago, and has reappeared in Shanghai society today. I remember that this film was also a sensation for a while!</p>
<h3>Illusion</h3>
<p>— Dao</p>
<p>It's late at night, the surroundings are as quiet as a tombstone, and the leaves outside the window seem to be faintly transmitting from a distance. In the room, only the clock on the wall ticks, and it is the only sound that plays in unison with the strings of my heart. In bed, although I closed my eyes, I couldn't sleep anyway. It was really distressing, so many thoughts quietly stepped into my head. Quietly listening to the pendulum running past sound by sound, my consciousness began to gradually become dazed. At this time, an image that I often think about suddenly emerged from the corner of my eye. The entire soul was immediately immersed in the fragrant and hazy state of pure wine, as if the body had already walked out of the house. There is a moon, the night is mysterious, silently basking in the milky white moonlight.</p>
<p>The girls' dormitory was already shrouded in boundless loneliness. In the swaying of light red gauze moonlight, an moving figure appeared, the upper half of her body leaning against the wooden railing, one hand supporting her chin, shooting out a clever and wise eye, staring at the moon in the blue sky in a daze. A gust of wind came, blowing her head of bird-silk soft hair, gently fluttering. Silver powder-like moonlight sprinkled on her face, further highlighting a charming and alluring coquettish attitude.</p>
<p>Everything is anesthetized in a scarlet tremor.</p>
<p>'A flower-like person, do you know how many young hearts you have captivated, but the days and months pass easily, and the eastward flowing water will not flow backwards. Don't lightly waste your youth. After the fifteenth of the moon, what cold jade is there to make up for it?' I stared at her unblinkingly. At the same time, my heart was filled with very envious self-talk.</p>
<p>Creation has endowed her with such a beautiful face, making the human world more lively. And she is still young, maybe she won't use pride to embellish her youth. Because her actions are all very innocent and pure. There is no trace of arrogant and cold expression. Not thinking about this, I shamelessly held beautiful fantasies, even to the point of daydreaming. Every time I touched her, I immediately felt a kind of inexplicable comfort, and a moist and beautiful emotion. This restless and unanchored body and mind almost flew over her day and night. In the end, I'm afraid I'll only end up with emptiness. But why did she come out alone to stand still on this quiet and cold night? This is not an easy opportunity to approach. I calmed my confused nerves. Then I slowly walked up and instinctively shouted:</p>
<p>| | Come down, I miss you so much, forgive my rudeness.</p>
<p>After speaking, I carefully searched around hesitantly.</p>
<p>I waited for her reaction, worried that she would ignore me. Guess what she did, unexpectedly she charmingly turned her bright eyes over.</p>
<p>From a distance, she seemed to be smiling, but she didn't say a word.</p>
<p>This moment of emotion was really a lot, like suddenly glimpsing a ray of light in the long winter night, the dim eyes immediately brightened, and the muscles and bones all over the body felt unspeakably soft and relaxed as if touched by an electric current.</p>
<p>After a while, I became more excited, and my courage was doubled. So I said again:</p>
<p>| | Dear, come down quickly, let me tell you a perfect story.</p>
<p>At this time, I vaguely heard the sound of light footsteps walking down step by step from upstairs. I almost jumped up with ecstasy. However, not long after. What appeared in front of me was the face of the hateful dormitory manager, and the clicking whistle came into my eardrums, and my heart couldn't help but jump wildly. My hands nervously squeezed a handful of cold sweat.</p>
<p>When I woke up from the dazed blur, I rubbed my tired eyelids and opened the room full of pale yellow light. It was occupied by dead silence. I cried bitterly. A lonely thin shadow obediently lay beside me, reminiscing about the scene a few minutes ago, like wisps of green smoke floating in the vast sky, unspeakable melancholy, filling the barren heart field.</p>

<h3>Correction to Ms. Cheng Xuezhen's Letter.</h3>
<p>The editor received two letters from Ms. Cheng. The first letter could not be answered due to the lack of an address. The one published on the 15th was the second letter. Now, after reading Mr. Li's letter and the letter attached to Ms. Cheng to Mr. Li, I know that their entanglement has been legally resolved. The editor deeply congratulates Ms. Cheng. As for the title 'Unfaithful Husband', it is based on the editor's reply based on the incoming letter. Whether it is a fact or not is not asked. According to Ms. Cheng's letter, adding 'Unfaithful' to Mr. Li is not intentionally defamatory. Now, Mr. Li's original letter is published as is, without changing a word. Due to limited space, the editor has not been able to reply, and will discuss it in detail later. Editor's Note.</p>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am Li Yueru. Today, I read the Amateur Mailbox column of the Local News Supplement of your newspaper and saw a letter from my divorced wife, Ms. Cheng Xuezhen, and your opinion, Mr. Li, on the incident: the title is 'Unfaithful Husband'. Originally, I didn't dare to disturb you, but the newspaper is a public reading material. Not only is my name clearly written in it, but you also openly mark it with the word 'Unfaithful', which can't attract readers' attention? Although I am not a celebrity, I don't need a set of 'denying rumors' and 'corrections', but personality and reputation are always related, so it seems inappropriate to remain silent. Moreover, on the surface, it seems to be my personal business, but in fact, there are many such things in the real society, and scenes are constantly being performed, so I dare to discuss it with you, give me a correct and clear criticism. I can be satisfied, and at the same time, similar sufferers in society can also gain a true understanding.</p>
<p>The facts stated in Ms. Cheng's original letter are generally correct, but without pointing out the reasons, it is difficult for people to understand. First, there is a problem with the time; probably her letter was sent to your publication before May 11th. You must know: our divorce agreement was signed very satisfactorily on May 11th, and the major local newspapers from the 12th to the 15th published announcements separately. Perhaps the general public did not pay attention to this. The fact of the divorce is as follows: both of us agreed to ask witnesses and signed the divorce at the lawyer's office on the 11th. I gave her seven-tenths of the existing cash as alimony. All her clothes, accessories, and part of the furniture were taken away by her. The two children are entirely under my care and upbringing. I also allow her that if I develop in the future, under possible circumstances, I can still subsidize her with considerable expenses. Second is the reason for the error: When it comes to this marriage, I was passive from the beginning. From the proposal to the marriage, it was all decided by my father. At that time, I didn't understand how important marriage and life were! I really didn't have any expectations for the future. After marriage, I began to contact society. The longer I struggled in society, the more experience and knowledge I gradually increased, and I gradually understood life, and I also understood what the basis of marriage is. As a result, the more my knowledge increased, the more my feelings for her decreased proportionally. Finally, our knowledge, interests, hobbies, beliefs, thoughts, and everything else were too different like grades, and we were getting farther and farther apart spiritually, completely forming two opposing and contradictory lives! Please tell me, can love happen in this environment? Can there be a happy marriage? As for producing two children, that is the result of a common and due instinctive impulse of human beings. From the perspective of knowledgeable people, it is definitely not believed that sexual intercourse must have love! If you really think that it is an expression of love, I believe that this person simply doesn't understand what love is.</p>
<p>I planned to divorce three years ago, because I didn't have the economic power, so I have been enduring that painful life of 'existing in name only', and I can't bear to let her, a woman without self-reliance, drift around casually, although it is also extremely embarrassing for me on a one-sided spiritual level. To this day, I have not socialized with women, and I dare not even try to prostitute myself. How can you casually agree with her one-sided statement and arbitrarily say that I 'have someone new'? Before our divorce, she even said: 'You can take a concubine as you please.' What reason do I have to abandon a reasonable divorce and take a concubine illegally? In today's society, there are facts of taking concubines and bigamy, and it is generally recognized as a natural trend. Why can't I do this? But what good is it for her?</p>
<p>I certainly cannot sacrifice myself and endure the pain given by this unreasonable union for a long time; nor am I willing to inhumanely let her live as a widow and suffer that miserable living sin.</p>
<p>Forcing two people whose wills are absolutely incompatible to become spouses is a sin, not morality! If I perfunctorily maintain it to the end, I am immoral! That is also a cowardly person without humanity. These words are certainly incomprehensible to people who are soaked in feudal thoughts, and may not be entirely true to people who have a superficial understanding; only by telling people with rich knowledge like you can I get sympathy and understand me. I know very well that with our situation, it is impossible to ask the law under the current social system to recognize that we have sufficient reason to divorce! But I guess that the law is nothing more than human feelings. Are human feelings contradictory and unreasonable? Is it reasonable to maintain this kind of union? I have to ask you for an answer.</p>
<p>Regarding your opinions, there are several questions that are worth answering and discussing: (1) Why do you feel so unfortunate? In this society where the old and the new are interchanging, we are inevitably victims, because we are not lucky people. (2) Why can't it be remedied? The foundation of a marriage is built on pure love. A union without love cannot be remedied! It can be said to be the mistake of society, or it can be blamed on the law. (3) How can we prevent such pain from happening again? This is related to the second question. I dare say it will never be cut off! You said: 'Only when a society where everyone has a job arrives in the future will this kind of pain not happen.' Maybe you are right, then when will a society where everyone has a job arrive? Will these pains really not happen at that time? Discussing this issue can become a work of tens of thousands of words, and I don't need to say much about it today. I want to say a lot, but I'm afraid it's not allowed by your publication. I've only said a few words, and the purpose is to avoid misunderstandings among the general public. Several months ago, friends had misunderstandings because of seeing your newspaper, so I especially ask you to publish my letter with the same attitude, so as to avoid more serious disputes! If this affects my reputation and personality, that's not a joke.</p>
<p>I am also attaching Ms. Cheng's recent letter, and you will understand after reading it. Please send it back immediately. Finally, I hope you will give a fair and clear answer. I wish you good health! Li Yueru on the evening of May 15th Revelation To Mr. Huang Shaofu, please send a letter to prove where and when the manuscript was published before, in order to cancel the manuscript fee, Supplement Editorial Office</p>
<p>Fiction</p>
<h3>The Poor Gentleman (9)</h3>
<p>— Written by George Gissing of England, translated by Sun Pu</p>
<p>'Please,' he said, 'give me a newly laid egg, and a fresh little lettuce.' 'Only one this evening?' said the woman.</p>
<p>'Thank you, only one,' he answered, as if speaking in a drawing-room. 'Pray excuse me, if I say I should like a really new-laid egg. Last time, I think, the eggs must have been carelessly put in the basket -- there's no help for that when business is hurried.'</p>
<p>'Always the same here,' said the stout shopkeeper. 'We don't make such mistakes.'</p>
<p>'Ah, pray excuse me! Perhaps I fancied --'</p>
<p>The egg and lettuce carefully stored in a bag he had brought with him, he returned home. An hour later, when, having finished his supper, he sat in the straight-backed chair, musing in the twilight, a knock came at the door, and a letter was brought in. A letter for Mr. Dymond was so rare an event that, as he examined the envelope, his hand trembled. Opening it, the first thing he saw was a small cheque. This still further excited him; he anxiously unfolded the letter. It was from Mrs. Wilmers, who wrote thus: --</p>
<p>'My dear Mr. Dymond, -- After our conversation last night I could not refrain from thinking of you, and of your beautifully self-sacrificing life. I compared the lot of those poor people with my own, and it made me feel that I was too fortunate, too greatly enjoying myself. The result of this thought is that I felt I must send some alms to your good work -- a kind of offering at the beginning of the happy holidays. Please distribute this money among two or three of your most needy assistants, or, if you think fit, give the whole to one person. I heartily hope we shall be able to see you at Lucerne. -- Take care of yourself.'</p>
<p>The cheque was for five pounds. Dymond stood by the window, gazing at it, with the letter in his hand. At his present valuation five pounds seemed a vast sum. Think what a man could do with it! His boots -- mended twice already -- would not much longer hold together without gaping. His trousers would soon be quite unpresentable. The hat he wore (how carefully he had cherished it!) was the same he had brought to London three years ago. He was, in fact, eagerly in need of a new outfit from head to foot; and at Islington five pounds would all but accomplish it. When, in the least, could he have possessed such a sum to use freely?</p>
<p>He sighed profoundly, and in the dimness he gazed around.</p>
