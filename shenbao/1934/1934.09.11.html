<p>第十四屆</p>
<p>國聯大會開幕</p>
<p>瑞典外長被推主席</p>
<p>蘇俄入盟列入議程</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　今日國聯大會開始其第十四屆會議、議程所列者、頗多重要事件、其第一項爲選舉大會主席、今日舉定瑞典外相桑德博士膺此任、首由總委員會報告員捷克外長貝奈斯博士致詞、其言雜有悲觀與樂觀、謂第十四屆會議之開幕、須處理一般的搖動、諸如理想·道德·與宗敎信仰之恐慌、皆在其列、並處理含有戰爭與革命危險之緊張的國際關係、博士演說之末段、語調忽轉樂觀、謂目前之狀况、巳呈露社會現忍痛而逐漸移向常度云、議程之第二重要事項、爲完成容許蘇俄加入國聯、軍縮問題似不致參入、僅將在幕後進行、（十日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　國聯大會選出瑞典外長桑德博士爲主席後、桑特頃巳就主席座、向大會致謝詞、大會嗣經决定議事日程、並决定本屆大會與去年相同、不設第三委員會、蓋第三委員會卽軍縮委員會、現值軍縮會議正在討論中、無設置之必要也、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　參加國聯大會者約有五十國代表團、其中二十五人係外交部長、此實國聯會之新紀錄、（十日國民社電）</p>
<p>臨時主席致詞</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　今日國聯第十五屆大會開幕、行政院主席捷克外長貝奈斯致開會詞、對遠東問題深切關懷、貝氏稱遠東之現在地位、國聯義實不容坐視、中日間局勢·滿洲國問題·日俄之緊張、三者均屬非常嚴重之事實、無人能否認之、此等問題近數年來在日内瓦固曾巳有公平之判斷、國聯不應被人輕侮且國聯巳成就一有價值而確切的結果、亦不容加以否認、雖然現在世界某數部份之情勢、尙未能藉國聯之活動而獲得期望之結果、且種種事端巳置國聯於極度的試騐之中、國聯已於此等事端獲得敎訓、自無庸置疑、由此等事端、足證任何大國在世界其他部份、例如歐洲遭遇類似之事件時、亦當束身聽受國聯其他多數會員之直接制裁、否則則應擔負使國聯歸於消滅之破壞責任、並將招致空前大不幸之結局、吾人對此向多忽視、今後應互相警惕、實關至要、而以處今日之世界爲尤然也云云、（十日中央社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　第十五屆國聯大會開幕時、臨時主席捷克外長貝奈斯發表開幕演說、歷陳過去一年中國聯各種事業之一般情狀、</p>
<p>先從日德退盟說起　就消極方面述及日本德國之退出國聯、謂國聯之歷史、盛衰起伏、本屬無常、然國聯本身對於其前途、不可不有自信力、卽令一二大國暫時退出國聯、國聯正可乘北時機作必要之準備、使脫退之國家、得重與國聯合作云、</p>
<p>負責處理玻巴爭端　國聯未能阻遏巴拉圭與玻利維亞兩國在大厦谷之戰爭、誠屬可惜、但本屆國聯大會巳接受該案、自當負責處理、</p>
<p>遠東局勢不容漠視　至於遠東之現狀、中日之衝突·滿洲僞國之問題·日俄關係之急張、雖屬目前異常嚴重之事實、然苟從客觀的歷史事實一加以考核、則過去數年來、日内瓦方面關於遠東問題之奮鬥、旣不至有辱國聯之使命、且亦未嘗不獲有重要具體之結果、</p>
<p>破壞國聯自召禍災　不寗唯是、就過去此種經騐觀之、則凡任何一國、例如歐洲國家如敢於觸犯國聯之制裁、則勢必至於消滅國聯、促成災禍、而使其本國亦遭滅亡、其所負責任又如何乎、此外倫敦經濟會議之失敗、亦可謂爲國聯之間接失敗、</p>
<p>國聯力量行見增重　至於積極方面、則近來多數國家擁護國聯、尤甚於前、美國與國聯日見接近、此外多數國家則力謀使蘇俄加入國聯、均足證明國聯之力量、斷不容置諸不問、</p>
<p>和平努力未嘗稍懈　觀於過去一年中、秘魯與哥侖比亞兩國間關於勒底細亞領士爭執之和平解决、薩爾區域公民投票預備談判之成功、若干互相合作、不侵犯及侵略國定義公約之簽訂、保障奥國獨立之交涉、訂立東歐互助公約之努力、此互助公約成立以後、世界其餘部分均不難依樣訂立、凡此種種、足見國聯縱使無充分勢力、以防止錯誤與禍患、仍具有不可毁滅之勢力、對於野心國家、仍爲不可超越之阻障云、貝奈斯結論則謂世界一般情形、尙稱滿意、其對於國聯會現行方式之力量與實效、甚表示厚望云云、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>不啻對德暗示警告</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　國聯大會今日上午十時三十分開幕、主席皮尼士致開會辭、其警句稱、如歐洲任何一國仍抱侵略野心、則遠東危局可爲殷鑒云、一致認此警告係一種對德暗示、皮尼士並宣稱、如以滿洲事件爲前例、而思在歐洲貿然一逞、則實行制裁卽無可逃避、皮尼士承認中日間及「滿洲國」内形勢非常嚴重、日俄關係亦甚緊張、此種事變、證明將來任何一國在其他如歐洲等地亦釀成相類之局勢者、必受國聯大多數會員國之制裁、否則亦將担負空前大慘劇戎首之責、而自身亦牽入漩渦也云云、皮尼士復槪括縷述世界各處危機四伏之局勢、及美國接近歐洲之事實、並暢論締結東歐公約之重要、皮尼士演說時各文明國代表團肅靜聆聽、直至演說完畢後數分鐘、</p>
<p>貝奈斯演說兩要旨　皮尼士演說之兩大要旨如下、</p>
<p>（一）歐洲各國爲世界和平起見、應歡迎蘇俄加入國聯、</p>
<p>（二）歐洲各國現正準備應付任何國家侵略他國、（十日國民電）</p>
<p>蘇俄入盟形勢</p>
<p>法代表團竭力活動</p>
<p>已獲三分二之贊助</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　國聯事件之英法意外部專家昨晚討論蘇俄加入國聯之手續、今日行政院將開秘密會議、以决定關於此事之之最後辦法、同時法代表團現方四出運動各國簽字贊成邀請蘇俄入會、此種友好行爲、乃法俄間密切關係之又一表徵、俄人對之、甚爲欣感、聞已簽字贊成者現達全體會員三分之二、此乃一國加入國聯所必有之法定多數、（十日路透電）</p>
<p>會外接洽頻忙</p>
<p>投票手續尙須考慮</p>
<p>波蘭態度於俄有利</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　自今晨起、蘇聯加入國聯一事、已成一最重視之問題、英國外相西門今晨與葡萄牙外長達馬泰會晤、所商談者當卽係此事、至於法國外長巴爾都則與波蘭外長柏克會晤、據波蘭方面推測、柏克將於本日午後在行政院會議中宣佈波蘭最後决定之立塲、並無不利於俄國云、目前所辦理者、僅爲蘇聯加入國聯會之手續問題、蓋大會投票時、有若干國家反對、若干國家可放棄投票、尙須加以估計也、一般人擬由贊成蘇聯加入之各國代表共同簽名、電致莫斯科政府、並附以國聯會盟約中關於會員國義務之條文、如今日午後六時之行政院會議表示贊成、則該電於今晚或明日卽可拍發、但對於大會中之通過手續、尙有阻碍、一般人主張依照從前土耳其墨西哥加入國聯時之例、由大會直接投票通過云、又巴爾都於午刻宴請各國首席代表多人、波蘭與葡萄牙兩國外長亦均在内（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>國聯奄無生氣</p>
<p>不啻打一輸血針</p>
<p>波蘭右派報紙之評論</p>
<p>華沙　右派反對黨報紙「華沙報」評蘇俄加入國聯會、謂「奄奄一息之國聯會、經蘇俄之輸血、得以復甦」該報又謂國聯之命運、繫於本屆大會之結果、其言曰、「若此次得到出路、則國聯會命運可保、否則歐洲局勢卽將完全改造、蓋紐倫堡國社黨革履之聲、將遠達於日内瓦也」云云、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>理事一席</p>
<p>土國與我逐鹿</p>
<p>（南京）　外交界息、國聯大會巳開幕、我國連任非常任理事問題、形勢尙佳、惟我方係競選連任、依照規定連任者須有三分之二之票、始能當選、而土耳其係初次參加競選、只須超過三分之一票數、卽可當選、故我國連任關鍵、須以投票時形勢爲定、（十日專電）</p>
<p>我禁煙提案</p>
<p>通過國聯委會</p>
<p>（南京）　國聯鴉片顧問委員會、八日通過我代表胡世澤所提議案、由該委會請行政院令在華享有治外法權各國採下列辦法、（一）各該國人民在華參與私製或私運麻醉藥者、應將其驅逐出境、不准復返中國、（二）各該國應制定法律、對各國人民在華私運烟藥或參與私製麻醉藥者决定處刑、（三）在華航行之各國航隻如經查獲係供私販烟藥之用者、應卽撤銷保護、（十日中央社電）</p>
<p>何應欽</p>
<p>講蘇俄與國聯</p>
<p>（北平）　平軍分會十日晨紀念週、何應欽主席、講讀總理遺敎民族主義第六講後、繼就蘇俄與國聯一題、發揮意見、謂蘇俄入盟、如能成爲事實、則國際政治局勢、將有巨大轉變、吾人所希望的、是各國之標榜和平政策者、不以和平政策爲一種戰略、不以和平政策爲一種成交的代價、而以和平政策謀人類幸福世界大同、然後人類的前途、或許有一綫光明云、（十日中央社電）</p>
<p>外蒙各地</p>
<p>蘇聯集中兵力</p>
<p>（北平）　留平蒙人息、蘇俄近向外蒙庫倫等鎭集中兵力、在庫倫郊外設立大規模化學兵器製造廠、預定九月下旬設置完竣、所長維利烏特莫窩、牧師共三十名、蘇俄空軍第九大隊長勃拉特布牟爆擊機二十一架、偵察機十三架、前後均抵庫倫、庫倫飛行塲正擴張工事、預計完成後可容戰鬥機四十六連、攻擊機三十一連、爆炸機四十六連、海軍機三十二連、外蒙紅軍兵力現約有五個師、分配於桑貝子方面及貝謙爾河南岸一帶、蘇聯此種軍事準備、似爲應付日軍進逼外蒙、（十日專電）</p>

<h3 id="c1">法意接近之展望 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>恒</p>
<p>日前外電盛傳。法意二國。卽將成立恊定。合力防止德國對奥侵略。同時法意間这殖民地問題。海軍平等問題。雙方亦巳讓步。卽意國對於修改和約之主張。聞亦準備放棄云云。此說是否可靠。尙有待於證實。唯就法外長巴爾都十月間將有羅馬之行一點以觀。二國之力謀接近。似巳不能掩飾。</p>
<p>自希特勒在德登台以來。法國外交。常佔勝利。一則小恊約與法之合作。益形鞏固。二則蘇俄漸與法國携手。三則英國亦梢改其技德抑法之態度。設今日更能與意恊調。則歐洲各國。莫非法之與國。德國孤立其間。益將無能爲矣。唯茲事體大。恐其成就不能如法俄携手之易於實現。蓋法意於歐陸。今皆擁有集團。而其所擁之集團。利害上又皆處於矛盾地位。故法意兩國之携手。必須兼使小恊約與奥匈同時携手。欲使小恊約與奥匈携手。又須使奥國之復辟運動。同時解决。匈國之修改主張。一併取銷而後可。此其一。再則法意實行海軍平等外交合作而後。英國海軍對於地中海之孔道。不無多少威脅。此在英國不能無所顧慮。若意國不再贊助德國重整軍備之主張果確。則英國之軍縮計劃。自必破棄無餘。故法意之結合。雖純在於對德。然其結果。勢必影響英英國之地位。此其二。</p>
<p>有此二點。可知法意之結合。决非單純根據兩當事國之意志所能成就。故日前之歐電所傳。僅能視爲法意二國願意接近之表示。而春成功關鍵。則一在小恊約與奥匈間之巳成關係如何調整解决。二在英國疑慮之如何消釋。若前者不得妥善之解决。則中歐之危機。終不能免。若後者之疑慮不祛。則英國或將重出於親德之政策。亦未可知。如是則不獨東歐公約之成敗將蒙其影響。卽遠東問題。亦必隨英國之親德而益臻複雜。關係之大。不言而喻。以法國巴爾都之精審明幹。當不至於魯莽以從事也。</p>
<p>質言之。法意結合。於今日德國之威脅下。自有成立之可能。唯法人事先必當另徵小恊約與英國之意態。方能妥善。否則必難有成也。</p>

<p>議定下月掉期實行今日開市</p>
<p>暗盤漲起十五元損失三千萬</p>
<p>銀行國外滙兌會昨討論</p>
<p>新聲社云、財政部前晚發出命令、限制外匯買賣、取締標金投機後、對經營國外匯兌之銀行及金業交易所、影響甚大、昨晨、銀行全以會·國外匯兌委員會·及金業交易所理事會·均召開緊急會議、金業交易所·及物品交易所停市一天、經理事長與監理員陳行·商定標金買賣價格標準、以中央銀行英倫金塊掛牌爲標準、嗣循經紀人大會之請求、新標準延至十月十五日十二月期掉頭時實行、今日仍照常開拍、昨日、標金暗盤巳較上星期六漲起十五元、茲分誌各情如下、</p>
<p>銀行外匯委會討論</p>
<p>銀行公會奉到財政部命令後、昨晨十一時國外匯兌委員會開會討論、到中國銀行貝淞蓀·大陸沈籟淸墾業王伯元等十二人、經詳細討論後、聞卽以意見貢獻財部、其内容尙難發表、據某銀行家談、財部命令中、對國外匯兌買賣、限於三種、而除第二條有明確之時期規定外、其餘（一三）各條、所謂合法與通常營業及私人需要、均漫無標準、殊有令經營外匯者無所適從之苦、勢必停止經營、或雖經營而無所交易、但外商銀行未必遵守功令、結果、恐徒然爲叢敺爵耳、</p>
<p>兩所停止買賣一日</p>
<p>金業交易所昨由監理員陳行轉到財部命令、不准以外匯結價、一律應以現金交割後、經紀人大起恐慌、由經紀人公會會長王家福等、向理事長徐補孫請求暫停買賣一天、茲誌理事會通告如下、（一）本日上海各報、内有財政部關於交易所之令文、現在巳由本所理事長到監理員處請示辦理應卽暫緩開盤、（二）本日下午二時、在金業同業公會開緊急會議、請各經紀人屆時準到、（三）本日因財部令文關係、午後開緊急會議、准照經紀人與本會面商辦法、暫停買賣一天、俟會議决定後、再行通告、物品金業部份亦同時停市、</p>
<p>理事會議定新標準</p>
<p>金業交易所昨日上午開理事會、出席者徐補孫·繆晋之·蔡久生·趙仲英·王志湘等十一人、由理事長徐補孫主席、議决、（一）按受財政部禁止以外滙結價命令、（二）標金市價、向以美國金元匯價爲標準、今後標準、財部命令中並無規定、由理事長與監理員陳健庵商定、以中央銀行每日掛牌之倫敦金塊價爲標準、</p>
<p>經紀人會請求延期</p>
<p>下午二時、全體經紀人、在北無錫路金業公會、開全體大會、由副會長王家福主席、討論辦法、（一）理事會所定新標準結價、應否贊同案、議决、所定新標準、萬難贊同、當塲公推恒豐永金號詹連生、元茂永金號王家福、代表赴理事會接洽、所有交易、暫照舊章、以本年十二月爲度、熟商妥善辦法、（二）旋據兩代表報告與理事長徐補孫接洽經過、所有新標凖、萬難變更、至掉期一節、或因時間侷促、得磋商妥善辦法、或延長至九月二十日或月底、議决、九月十五日十月掉頭、仍照舊標準、至十月十五日十二月期掉期、一律攺用新標準、仍推詹連生·王家福與理事長接洽、擔王兩人往見徐補孫、徐又轉謁監理員陳行、直候至四時三刻、詹王始返會報告、巳得監理員之同意、卽宣告散會、今晨照常開拍　　交易所外議論紛紛</p>
<p>昨日、金業交易所自佈告暫行停拍後、以套頭及搶帽子爲營生者、皆前往所中觀望、議論紛紛、謂嗣後不能買空賣空、將無立足之地、因做套頭者均手段老練、眼光尖銳、其所者、皆係外匯、如一面買進金鎊、一面卽計算賣出法郎、兩面相合、在何方可以獲利、卽做何種多頭、如不能以外匯做買賣、彼輩卽無頭可套矣、至搶帽子卽看市風漲落、時空時多、常隨大戶出入、藉博微利、今後取締投機、則金價可稍穩定、則此輩亦無利可圖矣、</p>
<p>標金暗盤漲十五元</p>
<p>昨日標金雖不開盤、但少數同業仍有買賣、因市塲空方較多、今旣限定現金買賣、勢必扒進捕足、故市價激漲、最高做過九百六十五元、聞有七十七條成交、最小做過五十八元、有四十九條做開、六十元交易較多、最後者六十元左右、比上星期六（收盤價九百四十九元五角）約漲十五元、外匯因標金停市、華商傾扒英金二十餘萬鎊、兼扒美金一百數十萬元、時在人心恐怖之際、故市勢極度混亂、而無正市面云、</p>
<p>統制匯兌無裨實際</p>
<p>據經營國際貿易者觀察、謂中國對外貿易、向來除担負貨物上之漲落責任外、尙須担負外匯漲落危險、現如果禁止標金投機買賣、則標金價格、比較穩定、對經營國際貿易者、减少危險、但中國旣有治外法權關係、事實上卽能禁止中國商人投機買賣、仍不能禁止外商投機、於是其結果爲標金投機、由華商移轉於外商之手、實際上無裨於統制國際匯兌政策云、</p>
<p>一日間損失三千萬</p>
<p>又據談我國因貿易上爲入超國、故在黃金市塲上、亦時爲空方、今必以現金交易、則空方勢必補進現貨、金價勢必更漲、如以昨日（卽十日）暗盤而言、在國際匯兌上、我國損失總數、巳在三千萬元以上云、</p>

<p>濬浦總局預測</p>
<p>浦江將發空前高潮</p>
<p>日期本月二十四日共發二次</p>
<p>如其有風外灘一帶潮將登岸</p>
<p>—地勢低窪處尤恐先外灘患水—</p>
<p>大通社云、本埠各堆棧、爲防秋潮泛濫、均巳開始作防禦工事、茲以事關重要、特探誌各情於後</p>
<p>高潮降臨迫於眉睫</p>
<p>據濬浦總局水理科金時中君云、本年高潮之最高紀錄、爲本月二十四日、（星期一）其高度較普通低潮高出英呎十二呎一寸三分、查外灘江岸高度、爲十四呎七寸、與此次所發高潮、距離僅二尺數寸而巳、</p>
<p>外灘受水事實許可</p>
<p>其時如風平無浪、固不致上岸、第秋季風多東北風、兼之吳淞口方向、又朝東北面、適當揚子江口匯之衝、萬一風起、則潮水必循淞口鼓浪而入浦江、又恐頭潮尙未退盡、二潮又興、則其高度、自必超過預測高潮數尺、則潮水之浸登江岸、爲事實所許可、</p>
<p>三馬路間尤易患水</p>
<p>金氏又謂、外灘後面、當四川路·漢口路·（卽三馬路）之間、其地面因歷年受重量建築物之壓迫、地勢已較外灘爲低、證之往年秋潮登岸時情形、浦江高潮、僅須漲至十三尺餘、其地潮水卽自陰溝中湧出、片刻泛濫、交通乃受阻碍、又如浙江路漢口路之交錯處、地勢低窪、亦相伯仲、正恐此次高潮猝發、此兩地必將先外灘而患水、</p>
<p>預測高潮日期時刻</p>
<p>據該局預測、本年秋汛高潮、以本月二十四（星期一）日爲最、該項高潮、分上下二次、第一次時刻在午前零點四十五分、高度達十二尺一寸三分、第二次時刻在午後零時四十五分、高度達十一尺四寸五分、水行速率、每小時爲二·三海哩、又悉二十五·二十六二天、其高度亦足破歷屆紀錄云、</p>

<p>四大火油公司</p>
<p>昨一致提高煤油價格</p>
<p>汽油售價尙有續漲趨勢</p>
<p>在華亞細亞·美孚·德士古·油遍地·四大火油公司自停止貶價競爭、協議劃定分銷區域、實施合作辦法以求、即將煤汽油售價逐漸提高、以挽前虧、最近除汽油巳三次高漲售價、以謀恢復前虧外、昨又提高煤油售價積極擴充市塲、茲誌各情如下、</p>
<p>煤油漲價　據悉前去兩年我國煤油售價、曾因在華四大火油公司、競估市塲關係、一度跌至最低格、全國平民、無不稱快、厥後四公司協議成立遂停止競銷、每十加侖售價、即漸次漲至七元七角、昨日起、四公司又致提高價格、每十加侖標價改爲八元二角、與前價比較、連漲半元、嗣後觀察市上供求狀况、尙擬繼續高漲、</p>
<p>汽油續漲　昨據汽油業中人云、我國汽油富藏、陜新兩省最多、惟惜缺乏人錢、致久未開發、貨棄於地、殊足可惜、我國汽車運輸、漸趨發展、汽油需要數量、　見增加、因無國貨供給、惟有取給於外、每年損失、殊屬可觀、前爲在華火油公司、私競關係、雖將每十加侖價格跌入六元以内、而未及半載、　下又漲達九元一角、觀察日後趨勢、按照其成本計算、似非漲至十二元以上不止、預計下月上旬、恐即將繼續高漲、</p>

<p>上項建議、打破里程遠近、（指超過五百公里以上之長距離言）以及基本運價等種種限制、論者或將謂爲駭人聽聞、實則此種運價即類似在美國通行巳久之「劃一運價」（BlanketRates）或「郵票式運貨」（PoalageStampbrtes）也、考美國鐡路於一八九八年六月、施行劃一運價、（即不問貨運所經之途程、收取同一之運費、）無論分等與不分等之貨物、均予適用、例如自米蘇里河（missouririver）起以迄大西洋海岸止、由此境内運往太平洋沿岸之貨品、其起點無論鄰近米蘇里河、或鄰近大西洋岸之地、其運價皆按劃一制規定之、又如新英蘭區内西向運輸之貨品、亦按劃一運價計算、意在使新英蘭之製造家得將貨品西運、可與鄰近原料産地之工廠爲優勢之競爭、不致新英蘭尖其繁榮也、至適用劃一運價之貨品、則凡易爲水運吸收之貨、均包括在内、如東部波士敦市所産之革履、如運至西部舊金山、本有兩途可循、一爲經由橫亘大陸之鐡道一爲經由水路穿過巴拿馬運河而達舊金山、鐡路方面爲恐此類運輸營業爲水路奪去、故施以劃一運價、又如西部加利佛尼亞省之橘、若運至紐約售賣、必與東南部佛魯利達之橘起競爭作用、倘按平常運價收費、則加利佛尼亞之橘商、將因虧折而裹足不前、而鐡路運輸及人民消費亦必受其影響故對於此類貨品亦施以劃一運價、（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c8">釋矛盾（續） <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>答吳作成，馮翹君</p>
<p>頡頏的意義就是「不能相容」，例如兩邊開戰，不是你敗，就是我敗，决不會有兩邊都勝利的道理，這就是頡頏頡頏的兩方面是完全没有統一的可能的，所以頡頏只是相反，而不是矛盾，矛盾的兩方面，在一定的時候，是能够相容的，甚至於要互相依賴，這在前面的私生活與理想等例子中，就指出來了。但是，我們也不能說矛盾就是永遠的能够相容，只是在一定的時候才能够相容，例如蛋裏的小雞和蛋殼是矛盾的，小雞要出來，就非要弄碎蛋殼不可，這是矛盾的解决。不過在小雞未成長到可以獨立行動的時候，是能够容納在蛋殼内的，並且還是非有蛋殼的保護不可的，所以小雞和蛋殼的矛盾，是在小雞未長成以前的時候，才能够相容，到小雞巳成長，就不能够相容了。所以矛盾與不能相容並不是完全不同的事情，矛盾要發展或成長到極頂的時候，才成爲絶對的不相容。在未到這種時候之前，仍是能相容的。頡頏的意味，却是絶對的不能相容；把矛盾看做頡頏的人，一遇到相反的事情，就認爲非馬上拼一個你死我活不可，不肯冷靜地順應着事物發展的趨勢去採取適當的處置。例如在小雞未成長的時候，本來應該使母雞去孵它，但他却急着要將蛋殼打破，這種行爲，是不但解决不了矛盾，反而將可以生成起來的小雞亞死了。再用生活與理想的例子來說，如果有人以爲生活和理想有矛盾，於是馬上抛棄了理想，只顧攢營眼前的小利，而不知道從生活的實踐中有達到理想的可能。這是把矛盾誤認作頡頏的弊病，</p>
<p>矛盾是在統一之中不斷地發展着的相反作用，矛盾的解决是發展到一定的程度時才會達到的。</p>

<p>鄭標再跌二三角</p>
<p>標棉前市開盤、以美棉估計增收、致多頭失望、而據私家電訊、美棉市價在估計未發表之前、收盤農部發表産額之後、現貨棉價跌去二三十磅音之說、因之開盤人心巳虚弱、各月跌二三角、同時聞姚花到三千多包、開價猛跌一元二四角、但有一投機者、購買七千餘擔、市價又回上、結果十月跌三角、遠跌一二角、午後開盤市氣平平、收盤又落、結果各月跌五分至一角、全日成交統計十二萬三千九百擔、查賣出惠康八千四百擔、大豐三千二百擔、恒昌二千三百擔、同孚一千八百擔、明德一千二百擔、元一五千七百擔、義成三千四百擔、泰昌一千二百擔、長豐五千二百擔、信誠二千三百擔、益豐一千二百擔、元泰一千七百擔、恒昌一千八百擔、買進　裕一千一百擔、源大五千擔、賡豐八千四百擔、均昶二千六百擔、恒德二千六百擔、潤康一千六百擔、愼昌七千一百擔、瑞源一千四百擔、裕康一千五百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<p>麥市上午開盤後、各月份市面、大致呈平軟之勢、以洋麥報價、芝加哥回小一二角左右、坎拿大小四分、當開價時、人心巳呈軟弱、因標凖方面、廠家一無進意、市上現貨如是豐厚、業外心思、亦不易振作、且各處得雨之後、糧食恐慌、稍轉和平、就米價而言、亦與頂峰挫跌不少、故人心逐步見虚、市面亦覺步步見鬆也、迨至下午開盤、因粉市巳小、人心更寂、買戶亦更稀淡、致各月份之跌度、亦頗巨大也、結果九十月份較前週跌九分、十一月份跌八分、十二月份跌一角三分、一月份跌八分、二月份跌一角、現麥市面、因粉銷平平、各廠進意甚懈、故無做開、</p>
<p>新粳續在下游中</p>
<p>（滬南）各帮來源十餘號、而銷塲更復呆滯、作客蒞市問津者甚寥、故爾形勢淸寂、市况頓疲、各帮厚粳及晚稻價中市者俱見猛跌二三角、僅鮮高者跌角許、至若新粳及新尖等都續向下游有二角之譜、陳羊尖乏貨無榮辱、變陰元無市、　　（滬北）昨河下各路來源廿餘號、市上各貨去胃淡弱、市形白粳價小一二角、薄稻定勢、白元新陳客尖價小尺外、新羊尖高料小二角、中次小三四角、東新粳又小三角、</p>
<p>期洋米客帮起注意</p>
<p>昨日洋客秈、現貨客化轉淡、上午開價均巳减小、後因舟山帮採辦湘砶、市氣一振、而期洋米忽被客帮注意、市面更形挺俏、期西貢隨爲跳起五分、現貨亦被貨主扳價、故成交雖少、市面亦有步砌之趨勢現洋米開出西貢一號高貨寳塔牌七百包、價十一元二角、香港元米一百包、價十二元六角、均比上週回好一角、由本街辦去、洋米邇日雖有到船、然到貨盡巳預早抛出路貨、到即應解、市上並無浮存、且上月廿三號開船之路貨迄未到申、市上正在紛擾催促中、故洋米市面反爲站住、而期西貢由九江帮辦去九十月份一千五百噸、價四元九角半至五元、又十一月份五百噸價五元○五分、回籠貨亦開五百噸、由本街囤户贛帮分去、市面立形挺俏、客秈開出二千餘包、除舟山去砶米六百包外、均爲本街辦去、晨間疲小數分、午後反漲角許云、</p>
<p>九江新黑豆開三元四角</p>
<p>昨有九江大粒新黑豆、做開三十一包、價爲三元四角、出品尙佳、該豆巳抵埠多日、因牛莊黑豆之價、祗開二元八九角、故該豆無人問津、昨因牛莊貨缺乏而始售開、新陳黄豆勢居盤旋之局、行情比較週六祗有一二分出入、去路陳豆有通州及本街走化、新豆有本街内地採取、計成交新豆八九百包、陳豆七八車、聞豆市前途、須看津浦路新豆上市後方分榮辱、</p>
<p>南北貨　生晒圓肉跌二元許</p>
<p>厦門生晒圓肉、邇來到貨稍增、兼之廣貨號盤降落甚多、厦貨亦難立穩、日前嘉禾岳州兩輪所到之貨、昨巳如數開出、貨品尙屬干赤、價比前跌去二元許、</p>
<p>糖市　粗砂白現貨微降</p>
<p>昨日糖市、以實銷依然有限、趨勢平疲如恒、公會劃盤二四粗砂白現貨普通劃十九元六角半、小去二分、碼頭交貨十九元七角半、不動、轉口貨六元半、荷赤現貨又小一角、較好者爲十四元三角半、普通十四元二角半、本廠綿白振記一號十八元七角、振裕一號十八元六角半、均乏上落、大古糖Ｂ嘜十九元九角半受手寥寥、號貨以去胃呆滯、昨市竟乏成交、</p>
<p>絲茶</p>
<p>海外絲織品秋銷呆滯</p>
<p>臨平秋蠶入大眼　杭屬臨平一帶、農民因旱荒關係、秋蠶飼蟻大减、嗣因桑葉轉靑分起、補育晚蠶、飼額雖稍暢、而統計祇及春蠶十之五、天氣適宜、發育順利、早蠶巳入大眠、晚蠶頭眠足葉、轉瞬即二眠起眠云、</p>
<p>雙宮絲印銷益暢　本埠雙宮絲廠、自鴻綸繼起開工後、絲産激增而印度需要益暢、輸出不寂、最近半個月中、由英輪三次裝出雙宮絲、共達一百十四包、今日英輪蘇曼利號亦有三十五包裝往孟買、</p>
<p>歐美絲電不轉　海外市塲、工潮蔓延、絲織廠原料進胃停滯、加以絲織品秋銷不起、紐約里昂絲市益淸、絲電仍不見轉、滬埠絲銷不動、昨祇杭綢廠進白廠經三十包、印莊進黄粗絲五包、價仍平定、</p>
<p>川黃絲經來滬見增</p>
<p>川黄絲經、自見新以來、因歐銷不起、運滬寥落、邇日來源漸見轉暢、最近民族民生等輪先後由宜昌裝到黄絲經一百八十四包、由葆太和等分别上棧待售云、</p>
<p>吳興秋蠶發育頗佳</p>
<p>吳興各市鄉農民、初因亢旱、秋收絶望、桑葉焦黄、秋蠶無意飼育、祇虹星橋·下源渡·紐店等處、孵種數十張、嗣氣後天和暖、蠶蟻無甚變動現巳二眠旺葉、邇來甘霖迭降、桑葉轉靑、蠶蟻發育轉佳、大半補育晚蠶、亦巳頭眠開葉、前途漸呈樂觀云、</p>
<p>五金　七分圓竹節鋼條軋缺</p>
<p>竹節鋼條、七分圓花色、現貨大缺、標凖飛俏、每噸估一百三十元光景、比前驟好十元多、交易本埠建築帮爲最暢、出口帮祗有問津、其他花色除六分方稍見回弱、估一百二十七八元外、别種殊無上落云、</p>
<p>汕頭帮採辦馬口鐡</p>
<p>據昨日馬口鐡市塲觀測、一百磅英德美法諸貨、因受汕頭帮之搜羅、市象大佳、行情各挺二角半、交易一千餘箱、計美貨開三十五元、英貨三十二元、德貨三十二元五角、法貨三十二元二角半云、</p>
<p>大廣皮新貨到申</p>
<p>大廣皮新貨近來巳有裝到、故需用此貨之搪磁廠客帮等聞此消息、莫不下手買進、故前雖星期、然成交依然達四五百担之多、行情開出每担自九元五角至九元七角半不等、聞兵工廠及熱水瓶廠家等亦有收辦云、</p>
<p>二寸三角鐡津銷活動</p>
<p>二寸三角鐡、近來天津帮生意又見活動、故市上採辦者頗爲熱鬧、但行情一節、受環境之壓迫、勢不得不步趨上升、現市每擔開五元七角半比前又硬起二角餘、而本埠電力公司等、近來亦多收買、是以市情十分優秀、售盤方面、有續好希望、</p>

<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第一回　鬼載一車關中來連客家徒中璧渡口吊秦人</p>
<p>但是在李士廉眼裏，却有一件特别感到興趣的，就是兩處拆了屋頂的人家中間，還存留着黄土地墻帶木板門的屋子，那木板門上掛了一塊牌，正是某省某縣某區烟酒征收分處的一塊木牌子。他情不自禁的咦了一聲。他心想，烟酒稅尙是大有可爲。可是他這個咦字，巳經驚動了全車的人。程志前道：李先生有什麽感想？李士廉道：我覺得在比較熱閙的地方，還有這樣的人家，他處可知了。常秘書道：别看這裏荒凉，據說是秦國的都城附近，幾千年前，秦始皇會在這裏統一了中國，築下了萬里長城。說句今不如古，倒也眞不是開倒車。程志前道：秦都咸陽，這就到了咸陽了嗎？常秘書道：你看，那不是咸陽古渡？說話時，汽車翻過了一個小坡，走上了内泥灘上。前面果然有條河，水色黄黄的。在河那邊西南角上，有半圈子黄土坡，在臨河的這一面，土墻上撑出兩個瘦小的箭亭，一高一矮，一遠一近，相映成趣。汽車一直開到河邊，看水流倒是很急。河岸上，泊了四五隻渡船，樣子很古怪，没有蓬是平面，上面可以渡車輛騾馬。頭和艄，都是方的。若不是船艄稍微高一點，正像一隻加大的方頭鞋子。有隻較大的渡船，由那邊過來，巳靠了岸，船面上停了兩輛轎車，還有四五副擔子，其中有個十六七歲的姑娘，穿了件直條子藍布短夾襖，耳上掛了兩個銀質圈圈，分明是鄉下女子，却又剪了頭髮。他看到這邊這輛汽車，是轎式的，和大路上跑的貨客車不同，只管張望。偶然看到程志前也在打量他，這才低頭走了。（一六）</p>

<h3 id="c13">諸葛瑾墓 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— 陳警愚</p>
<p>奉賢鹽溪之西南隅，相距不過二里許，有一古墓。鄉人號稱諸葛墓。</p>
<p>此墓之建築何似，已因年久之故，深陷地中，不可得見：唯餘荒土一坯，曁墓嶺石碣一方而已。</p>
<p>碣制殊簡陋，僅鐫碗口大之「諸葛瑾之墓」五字，字體絶非漢隷，而爲一種極其拙劣之眞書，故驟視之，幾疑出於好事者所傳會。顧據鄉間父老傳言，關於是墓之歷史，有類似神話之後列一段故事：</p>
<p>當明末「天啟」時，鄉人耕此，地忽傾圯，成一穴，入之，甚遼廓，黝暗莫辨路徑，摸索以行，手觸物，凉澈骨，蓋石壁也！緣壁前進，達盡處，則見一缸燃炬，光燄熊熊！隱約有一室，若廳事，一巨棺懸其中，棺前陳一案，上列各種不知名之獸形器物。鄉人覩狀，詫爲魅；爰將所持農具擊破其缸，反身思遁，足絆於石，仆諸地，蹶然起，復碎之，狂奔而出。事傳鄉里，觀者麕集！里正懼滋事，亟聞於縣：縣令蒞勘，誦其所毁之銘，識爲三國時諸葛子羽之埋骨處：乃飭役窒其穴，立石誌之，卽今之矗然墓上者也！</p>
<p>按古人臨窆，棺前輒用巨缸，中貯漆油參半，以棉索燃之，閉置土中，縱空氣隔絶，永弗熄滅，漆油亦不涸竭；厥名謂之「長明燈！」發現極古之墓，殆有十九而然；徒因鄉愚無知，少見多怪，遂使千載以前古物，遽罹摧殘之厄！詎不大可惜哉？</p>
<h3 id="c14">訓子 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— 頡</p>
<p>亭子間的五歲女孩子，於傍晚時隨了前樓裏十一歲的男孩子到弄堂口去遊散，弄堂口納凉的很多，擠出擠停，女孩子給人撞跌一交，一個小屁股適坐在汚水裏，弄得剛沐浴後換上的衣服，沾染了汚泥，十一歲的男孩子急扶了他回去。」女孩子的母親見孩子衣服汚了，不由得冒起火來，伸手一記耳光，打得女孩子大哭起來。同時駡道：爲甚跟壞小囡去白相。前樓嫂嫂聽見兒子把人家孩子闖了禍，並駡伊兒子壞小囡，便一氣就氣到透不過氣來，拉了兒子到亭子間嫂嫂面前，罰他跪下賠罪。孩子不聽話，就一把耳朶提回前樓，隨手關閉了房門。在樓下的人，祇聽得樓上拍拍的聲音，和孩子呌哭，嫂嫂怒駡之聲相和着。此聲歷久不斷，樓下人急急奔上去解勸，無奈嫂嫂巳早閉門甚緊，狂叩不開。而且裏面的拍拍聲愈緊愈響，孩子號呌聲愈大愈慘，嫂嫂怒駡聲愈急愈高。對過露台上有人據高臨下向嫂嫂房中望去，只見嫂嫂蓬了頭髮，手執二尺多長的籐鞭，殺氣騰騰地向孩子身上上下下打去，孩子一起一踞，兩手一上一下地招架，口中悽厲的呼號，像正在吃刀的猪　，露台上人實在慘不忍覩，高聲喚止。嫂嫂聽見喚勸，有如火上澆油，殺相益可怕，鞭子益下得密如雨點，孩子在地板上打滾，露台上人急忙退下去，以免再增嫂嫂之怒，而使孩子多吃苦，可是拍拍之聲仍不絶，號呌怒駡亦共奏，約又過了六七分鐘，拍拍之聲始漸漸稀疎而隱下去，號呌怒駡亦漸漸消沉在黑暗中。</p>
<p>明天，孩子終算依舊能下樓來走走，可是赤着的上身，紫黑色的傷痕縱橫，不知其幾十百條，兩膝下也是數不淸的紫黑條，膝以上因褲子的遮掩不可見，嗚呼，中國母親之訓子！</p>

<h3 id="c16">蓬萊閣 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>— 玉虹</p>
<p>蓬萊閣這個地方，在從前也許没有多少人去注意它，只爲今年春天基督將軍馮玉祥，特地不遼千里的去遊了一下，使這埋没東魯的勝境，也漸漸的爲人所樂道了。</p>
<p>蓬萊閣在膠東蓬萊縣的北門外里許，（老殘遊記開篇即說蓬萊閣在蓬萊縣東門外，此老想轉了向了吧）倚山臨水，形勢絶美，所謂「丹崖仙境」者，就是指此而言的。在這山上除了蓬萊閣之外，其餘的廟宇也很多，歷代名人的碑誌，亦屬不少，蘇學士東坡，因爲曾坐宰於此，所以也爲湖山添了不少的佳話，到現在他老先生的塑像，還端坐在廟中，而受遊人的敬禮。</p>
<p>閣西有澄碧軒，閣東有觀蘭亭。都是遊人憇息之所，也是避暑的好去處，每當夕陽初下，憑窗遠眺，長山在望，漁歌盈耳，眞有飄飄欲仙之槪，所以每當炎夏，常有人在此設宴會友。</p>
<p>蓬萊縣除了蓬萊閣外，尙有其餘的十大美景，如「銅井金波」「漏天銀雨」「獅洞烟雲」「萬斛珠璣」「海市蜃樓」「日出扶桑」，「晚潮新月」「漁樑歌桌」「高閣凌空」「萬里淸坡」等，不過有些是有名無實的，但「海市蜃樓」却是不可多見的一幕美景。</p>
<p>蓬萊閣因年久失修，早巳頽敗不堪，當吳孚威將軍坐鎭中州時，曾一度發起重修，但可惜這計劃未能完全實現，到現在呢，更儼禁成了丘八太爺們的行宮，遊人更無從問津了。</p>
<h3 id="c17">白牛村 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>— 高金嶽</p>
<p>一條皚雪似的大白牛，從芳草堤上踱過來，越顯得肅穆靜閒之致。</p>
<p>離開楓涇北栅不遠的所在，溪　瀠繞，樹木蔭翳，風景很是幽蒨，有個小小村落，呌做白牛村。原來宋朝名人陳舜兪（蘇東坡同時的），他厭棄了纱帽隊伍，到這地方結了茅屋數椽，躬耕讀書，常常騎了白牛，往往堤塘田野間，高興的當兒，吟吟詩，吹吹笛，悠然自得。後來洪坤煊做了一　白牛居士跨犢歌，單道他隱者的生活：</p>
<p>一村莎草平蕪色，江南十里春如織，靑楓徑畔夕陽時，跨上烏犍人不識，水田漠漢煙濛濛，輕蓑短笠嬉凉風，東郊雨晴泥路滑，四蹄踏破花溪紅，萬言獻罷歸來早，熙寗新法太草草，遠傳風敎憶何汾，桑麻自占溪流好，南山白石淸水寒，何人長夜歌漫漫，黄昏飯半銅轅下，明日橫經角上看。</p>
<p>舜兪的死，蘇東坡做了一篇文章悼惜他；和歐陽修序梅聖兪詩集，同樣的一往情深咧。</p>
<p>可是，這白牛村的來歷，據村老的傳述說：「從前，每到望日，月白風淸之夜。在這裏出現了一頭没有主人家的大白牛，蹲着咀草兒，好奇的村農追上去捉它，它很快地奔到池塘裏不見了。最後一回，給個村農在池塘邊牽住了它的鍊條，於是没命地拖它上岸，但它伸首一口把村農的腿咬傷了。這村農僅僅拾到—一小截鍊條，拿家去看着是赤金質的，他欣喜得了不得，不料這福無　至的村農，始終没法醫好他的創傷，直到他拿着的一截赤金鍊完全化光。迷信的村農，都虔誠頂禮這白牛，呌這村做白牛村，這塘做白牛塘了。」</p>
<p>當然這神話式的傳述，是不及那前面所述的載諸志乘的斑斑可考啦。</p>
<h3 id="c18">御香縹緲錄 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>其時我們的司機夫正用着全副的精神在從事，因爲他巳受了慶善的命令，必須要使太后的那輛車恰好靠在月台的中央，那末待太后一下車去，便可踐在那一張杏黄色的毛氈上了。</p>
<p>這一日，天津以及天津附近各處的重要官員，不論文武，全是很早就到這裏來候駕了。每個人都依着自己的品級，盡其所有用心裝扎起來：因此，待我們到時，他們巳列就了很長很長的行了。滿眼只見紅紅綠綠的顔色，耀得人眸子也幾乎睜不開。他們一見駕到，就鴉雀無聲地在月台的向外的邊綫上端然跪着了。比這些人跪得前一些，獨自孤零零地俯伏着的，便是袁世凱他自己！</p>
<p>列車很慢很慢的在他們面前滾過，終於是完全停止了。我往常是極愛瞧熱鬧的，但看了這些泥彫木塑般的官員，心上便不免有些不自在起來。尤其是他們各人的神氣，好說是没有一個不可厭的：頭低過了前胸，眼晴注視着地上，似乎連氣也不敢喘的樣子，敎人一見，就不會相信這是一種出乎眞誠的行爲。不過他們的服裝總不失爲是很美麗的一堆。其中有大部份人的圍帽上，都裝着孔雀毛孔所做的翎子：孔雀毛原是很好看的，它的本身就有一種光彩，再加其時的陽光正盛，從蘆蓬外面透射過來，照得所有的孔雀毛，齊像變了金葉子一樣，到處全是輝煌燦爛的金光在閃動。看了這種情形，幾乎要使我懷疑：（一二五）</p>

<p>— 徐懋庸</p>
<p>四川地方有兩個和尙，一個有錢，一個窮得只有一鉢一盂。有一回，他們碰在一起，彼此都說想到南海去巡禮。但是那個有錢的和尙，朝打算，晚打算，打算帶多少川資，趁什麽船，辦怎樣的行裝，路上會不會有危險，打算了許多時候終於打算不好，過了一兩年，還是不能成行。誰知，就在他打算不定的期間，那個窮和尙，巳經徒步到過南海而回頭了。</p>
<p>這個故事所寓的敎訓是：主觀的意志之力可以戰勝客觀的物質環境。淸人彭端淑用這故事證明下面的理論：「天下事有難易乎？爲之，則難者亦易矣；不爲，則易者亦難矣。」</p>
<p>誠然，這是很有點道理的，但是，假如那個富和尙的意志也同那個窮和尙一樣强，那便怎樣呢？無疑地，南海是要讓富有先到的，因爲他有錢，旅行時方便得多。</p>
<p>對於一事的成就之難易，物質環境的决定的力量究竟是大於一切的。</p>
<p>目前的大衆語的反對者，常常這樣說：五四時代提倡白話文的人，馬上能够做出白話文來，現在提倡大衆語的人，却只會空嚷，拿不出貨色，這足見大衆語運動的空虚，無聊——他們以爲這話很有力，然而，其實是毫無道理的。</p>
<p>我們要知道大衆語是和大衆的一切問題相聯繫的，它决不單單是一個語文的改良運動，它是整個的大衆生活提高運動中的一個運動。</p>
<p>不過我們同時要知道大衆語運動和白話文運動有個兩樣的地方，就是彼此的客觀環境。五四時代，市民階級在經濟上巳頗有勢力，甚至當時獨占政權的封建軍閥，已不能不倚仗他們，同時，他們用自己的錢在國内外大學裏製就了他們自己的智識分子。有了經濟勢力，有了自己的文化工作者，再加上實際的政治運動，市民階級的成功自然較易。白話文這東西，由市民階級自己的文化工作者來創造，出貨當然是快的了。</p>
<p>看看現在的和大衆語運動相聯繫的大衆，是怎樣的呢？他們的經濟生活，他們的文化程度，那一樣可以和當日的市民階級相比？對於這樣的大衆要求立刻拿出大衆語或大衆文化來，不是太性急了麽？四川的富和尙買不起飛機，决不會三兩天就到南海的。</p>
<p>現在的提倡大衆語的人們，並不是大衆自己的文化工作者，他們只因感到大衆語這種東西是應該有的，而且是可以帮着大衆去做的，所以帮着做。帮着而巳，並不相信自己能够造出大衆語標本來。道地的大衆語，是只有提高了程度的大衆纔能建立的。所以，對現在提倡大衆語的人，要求拿出大衆語的是更其性急的人們。</p>
<p>大衆語運動是個艱鉅的運動，但並不是不能成功的事情。要成功，先是應該創造良好的客觀環境。</p>

<p>中國的史書，編製雖不盡如人意，然在所謂四部内，史部巳經最爲完善了。經，子，是毫無辦法的東西，幸好他不會再加多。集也是龐雜的一部，却亟待改革。</p>
<p>中國古人的全集，不能與西洋作家的全集并論，西洋作家大都在專門的範圍内發展，而中國作家則無所不談。隨便是韓柳歐蘇那一個的全集吧，有公文，有應酬文字，但也必有純粹的文與詩，以表示其是一個文人。這樣的全集，自須加一番選剔。</p>
<p>制誥表疏之類的文字，大槪都見歷代的記典章之書，巳能保存，集中無保存之必要。傳記碑志等類的文字，價值只在歷史方面，該編成歷代傳記文編之類的書，備作史料，無須有怎樣廣的流傳。此外凡非屬於純文學的，都不妨設相類的辦法，而使賸下來的是一種純粹的東西。自然也有些集類。太平廣記中的文字，在當時是被視爲不足輕重，於是剔開擱起的，我們今日最好是把同樣的方法，施之我們認爲該擱起的。這是一種必須有的總集，至於歷代文選式的總集，可有可無。</p>

<p>若干年前有人說過這樣的話：我們科學世界里的人，只知道輕氣養氣，却不知有所謂「雅氣」。</p>
<p>這方面只知輕氣，養氣，淡氣，那方面只知雅氣，俗氣，傖氣，未免彼此皆吃一驚。這些又多是無色無臭，只是後者無質，不能有原子量，自然燒或助然燒。</p>
<p>在新舊交爭之際，彼此持論大槪走極端，保持五十里，却不能不進攻一百里，是是當然的道理。不過抛開戰功不論，只看這些話本身，皆有些裝孫子。</p>
<p>細看一班燒試管動鎚鑿的人們，除了機械生活以外，便皆是凡夫俗子，高尚風雅一無所知麽？在中國如此，在西洋决不如此；反之對文學更了解，於藝術能賞鑒，聽音樂有會心。其風雅高尙，更普遍，更廣大，更深微。一方面科學館造得大，另一面議術館音樂院更高上天去。</p>
<p>反之，們若這燒輕氣鍊養氣的科學和人生無關係，没有用途，這科學便不值一學。科學有科學之眞理，但不是一切的眞理。一致而百慮，同歸而殊塗，那將來是瞄準着人類的幸福。離開本身，佛法是什麽；離開人生，科學又是什麽，這種小道理，實在無需怎樣「論戰」的。</p>
<p>如果住着科學之房子，蓋着科學之氈子，病了還吃科學之藥，難道說科學不是支配着人類的一切麽？支配固然是支配了，但這不是月亮上或星球上掉下來的，是人類自己造出來的，是人類支配着自己的一切，没有旁的人或物應該感恩。人類除了住房子蓋氈子吃藥之外，也還有旁的事。</p>
<p>現在知道了，科學世界里的人，是謀人生至於幸福之境的人，是期人類臻於善美之境的人們。淡氣雅氣之爭，科學人生論戰，皆乾矢橛————。</p>

<p>— 黎錦熙</p>
<p>又小乘二十部中，最初分「大衆部」和「上座部」，互爲對待，似乎有了階級性，但實際上是結集經典時的地點不同，（傳佛滅度之年，於窟内窟外兩處結集經典，窟内以上座之耆宿多，迦葉居首，故名「上座部」；窟外以年少之僧　多，無别標首，故名「大衆部」。）從來便演成宗義上之分派（傳佛滅後百年，有大天比丘出，昔時窟外結集之苗裔多附同之，故取昔名「大衆部」；窟内者則反對大天之義，故亦襲昔名「上座部」。後由二部更分十八部，共爲小乘二十部）總之，「大衆」在中古以後，爲釋家之常言，其義最爲平等，只須備具一個條件：佛敎信徒，則雖天魔人鬼，乃至馬牛鷄犬等畜生，悉得加入此項「大衆」（把「大衆」加於其他名詞上的，如「大衆印」，就是一寺公用之印鑑。外如凈土編之「大衆莊嚴」，及初學菩薩之「大衆威德畏」等，頗不少，不列舉了。）</p>
<p>（三）近代普通用法，則「大衆」就是衆人不但階級宗敎種種制限都没有，並且也不必聚作一堆，就是散在的人們有時也可以呌做「大衆」。此義通行無煩舉例。（加於其他名詞上的，如南方方言極刻毒的駡人語，曰「大衆崽」，也就可證明此義。）</p>
<p>（四）現代又有拿來義譯西洋的「舶來品」的，「大衆」就相當於英文的Ｔhemarses（或譯作「羣衆」）。這個原詞却巳有了階級性（故又或譯爲「平民」，或爲「下層階級」），蓋始於一八八六年（淸光緖十二年）英相格蘭斯頓，他把這個詞和TheClases（或譯爲「上流社會」）作相對語，遂成用法上的新趨勢（詳見牛津新英文大字黄卷六頁二○七），最近漸用於多數集體的人民（如所謂「勞動大衆」「無産大衆」「農民大衆」等：加於其他名詞上，則如勞動組合就呌「大衆組織」，總同盟罷工就呌「大衆罷工」，聚衆要挾就呌「大衆行動」，只圖日常利益而不顧思想的集團運動就呌「大衆運動」等），似乎回復到中國的舊義（但這個農工集體是自動的，不過也有被「徵發」的）：或用於一個黨的基本部隊（如工會在前衛黨裏呌「大衆組織」）與對於幹部而言的普通會員（亦勞動團體所用）。　　但我們把「大衆」作形容詞而加於其他名詞上的，實多相當於英文之Popular或譯「平民的」，或爲「通俗的」），「大衆語」卽其一也。恕我淺陋，只看到英文中有Popular，還有發見Mass-laugnage，（Mass-literature—「大衆文學」却是有的，但也歧義，另節再說。）其實我們作國語運動的，只顧實際的研究工作，原不稀罕「大衆語」這路新色名詞，因爲把漢字累疊起來儘能任情製造。但古人道得好：「有循於舊名，有作於新名，」旣大家發起「新名」，高興討論，却也不妨隨和。不過「新名」界說，須先約定；就上舉諸語源說，總覺得無論何種「大衆」，加到「語」牛上，立刻「寃親平等」，變成「大衆化」（Popularization）的意思了。（因爲這個「語」字的意思是「言語」之「語」，而非「標語」之「語」也）。「名從主人」，「大衆」的正解，自以現在本國大衆已經習用的第（三）義爲妥：「大衆就是衆人」。然則「大衆語」的眞詮可知巳！</p>
<p>但是是話也終於没有這麽簡單，謹將現在詮釋「大衆語」的諸說，約成三個定義，各加評判，製爲短論，業經發表：　　（一）大衆語果有「階級性」嗎？</p>
<p>（二）大衆語和「方言」是否矛盾？</p>
<p>（三）大衆語要不要「標準語」？</p>
<p>綜合上來三個不同的定義，芟其秕稗，擷其菁英，會通其旨歸，剖析其條理，約成數言，以待論定：</p>
<p>「大衆語」者，是一種有建設性而不具階級性的標準方言，與其他異於標準的各種「母語」方言並行不悖；隨時代而演進，依交通而擴大，應文化而充實，藉文藝而優美：這都是自然的。我們從敎育的意義上建設「大衆語」，就是把落笔「大衆」和前進的「大衆」所有意識間的衝突，的矛盾，統一起來，使這種標準方言成爲「一國全民族大多數的人同時彼此都能聽得懂，說得出」的「普通話」。</p>
<p>「大衆語」的定義果然是這樣了，那我終於不知道他和「國語」或「白話」有甚麽異同了！</p>
<p>本來牠們是「同實而異名」的！</p>
<p>本來一切辯論，都不過搬弄幾個異名！</p>
<p>本來一切問題，不經過實踐的工作，都得不到實際的解决。</p>

<h3 id="c25">僞國祀孔 <a href="#c25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>— 愚公</p>
<p>孔子今年交紅運，祀孔的盛典，民國以來所罕見，如今僞國亦要舉行盛典了。</p>
<p>小孩子的時候，孔誕不過是學校放一天假，社會上一點關係都没有，城裏的文廟荒草不但生在庭裏，而且殿上都有，没有人去理牠；現在可就不同，大加修葺，煥然一新，祀孔那一天，各省的文廟都舉行了大典，軍政黨學商各界齊集行禮，還用了古樂古器，以崇古典。這是民族復興的現象，老年人靑年人一致高興，連孔老夫子吃到冷肉也要宛爾而笑了。</p>
<p>可是，報載僞組織亦議定於九月十三日祀孔，逼令各僞省廳公署，令於是日舉行盛大紀念，各僞機關科員以上職員均參加，並將演所謂王道敎育影片。這種消息傳到我們中華民國的人民的耳朶邊，實在應該加以注意才是。</p>
<p>我們應該注意的是：僞組織配不配亦舉行祀孔盛典，而且還要公演王道的敎育影片？</p>
<p>孔子作「春秋，而亂臣賊子懼」，所謂亂臣賊子，究屬是怎樣東西？則溥儀鄭孝胥輩，爲標準的亂臣賊子，這是無疑的。據淸末今文漢學家的理論說是起初他老夫子的學問，本來是「從周」的主義，所以說「郁郁乎文哉，吾從周」，直到自衛反魯，他老夫子的學問却大變了。他曉得周朝的制度，都是一班天子諸侯大夫定的，回護着自己，欺壓平民，於是乎一變而爲「民貴」主義，要自己制禮作樂起來。所以又說行夏之時，乘殷之輅，服周之冕，改制變法，顯然可見，又著了「春秋」。言外見得凡做了一個人，都有與聞國家政事的權柄，不能逞着一班貴族，任意胡爲的。自己先做個榜樣，褒的褒，貶的貶，儼然天子皇帝刑賞的分兒，其實這刑賞的職分，原是百姓的，從來倒置慣了，他老夫子就拿「春秋」去翻了過來吧。——淸末今文漢學家根據的是公羊高的理論，他將孔老夫子推崇成爲一個平民主義的政治家。如以現在的術語說來，他孔老夫子還是一個爲大衆謀利益的革命家裡。（不一定他老夫子在「論語」上的說的話，還是當時的大衆語啦。）</p>
<p>大槪我們中華民國的尊孔祀孔的理由，就是因爲他老夫子是一個爲大衆謀利益的革命家吧？那末，僞組織那滿洲國如今也來尊孔祀孔，還在宣傳王道，這不是矛盾可笑的事嗎？僞組織那滿洲國的制度是君主的，——溥儀那小子做了執政不算，偏要做皇帝就是一個明證。——孔老夫子的學說是眞正有利於民主制度的國家，只有我們中華民國才有資格去尊孔祀孔，她僞組織滿洲國那是没有資格尊孔祀孔的，而且她僞組織滿洲國是人家的傀儡，自作威福，「欺壓平民」，而且還成了傀儡戲牽綫人的工具，秣馬勵兵到處挑釁，那裏配得上什麽王道？</p>
<p>然而僞組織滿洲國她也尊孔祀孔，究竟是什麽用意呢？原來孔老夫子的儒學，第一是尊王，就是如今文漢學家的理論來說吧，他老夫子雖然是平民主義，可是他是在皇帝之下絶對服從的平民主義，正如耶穌的主義一樣，要平民在服從皇帝的範圍内講究自由平等。就是說，平民「都有與聞國家政事的權柄」，也是在皇帝允許下才有自由。現在僞組織滿洲國自稱是君主制度，他們正可利用孔老夫子這一點學說來，惟銷他們的愚民政策，所以，僞組織滿洲國也要來尊祀我們中國的孔夫子。至於王道的敎育，更是她僞組織滿洲國麻醉我們東北的同胞的最好工具，她怎麽不應用呢？</p>
<p>這樣看來，孔子雖然在我們中國宛爾而笑，可是對僞國却是大不高興的事啦。</p>

<p>— 老吹</p>
<p>本黨的成立，由來巳久，大的遠在光宣之間。我是一個後來加入的黨員，故未曾深知本黨成立的歷史。</p>
<p>本黨的宗旨，和三開黨，共産黨，斧頭黨，拆白黨等等，完全不同，我們的黨，以皮話爲宗旨，因此名爲皮黨，本黨的黨員，爲廖阿鳳，朱阿三，陶牛，朱大塊頭，區區亦其一，不過尙在跑龍套之列吧。（以上名字，多是本黨同志特殊的雅號）</p>
<p>本黨的黨綱，以不談政治，不談社會，不談做官，不談經濟，不談正結話，不談痛心悲慘的事，故名爲六不主義，入黨的資格，亦甚簡單，祗要一人以上的介紹，並能說三句皮話，他人駡汝猪玀，癟三，而成孔不紅，談笑自若者，卽爲合格。</p>
<p>本黨因爲經濟缺乏，没有固定的開會塲合，故叙集之處，大約總在中等旅館居多，一則大旅館住不起，鄭家木橋的小旅館又不好意思。二則本黨的黨員，大抵衣食奔走於四方者居多，　本黨皮話大會，眞是遙遙無期的。</p>
<p>聯絡黨員感情，互通黨員聲氣，往往以書信代之。故書信之中，多稱皮兄皮弟，也不作閣下，敬維，敬啟者，敬請啥安等等客套語，信的内容，也是嚴守六不主義，在這一點，黨中規例甚嚴，没有人敢破壞的。</p>
<p>本黨同志相遇，亦必稱阿啥阿啥，不作興稱兄道弟，集會的時，笑話說得愈多愈好，俏皮話說得愈趣愈好，必令在座的人莫不前仰後合，捧腹大笑不止。總不會使在座的人，相視無言，感覺寂寂也。</p>
<p>總之本黨的皮話，以挖苦、討便宜，說死話，爲不二法門，同志的老子和家婆，往往爲攻擊的對象，時要牽動他們的頭皮。尤其是討七大八的，頭皮更是牽得利害，最是該死，所以我的作文也，有些皮裏皮氣，不曉得得罪他人，也不曉得自己差誤，這也是深受黨的訓練所致吧。</p>
<p>當本黨同志正在叙談時，偶有非黨員到來，驟然聽見了我們談吐風生，假定規矩一些的人，往往面紅耳赤，驚爲奇聞。假定心中稍有不快的人，如其加入戰團，一定樂以忘返，樂以忘憂。所以我曾經聽見過一位非黨員說，我們倘能天天如此快樂，必定要活到八百歲，否則至少也須四五百歲。</p>
<p>我們的黨員廖阿鳳，他的胃病，着實厲害，人人說他將死，他自己也曉得將死，但是到了現在，非但不死，反而一天一天地好了起來。也恐是皮話的功勞吧。</p>
<p>假定有人中懊惱，處境不快，或胸襟拘束的人，如其加入本黨，自會萬念俱消，共登壽域的。</p>

<h3 id="c27">羊 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— 阿蘋</p>
<p>搬到這裏來將近三個月，到昨天我才發現對過那兩扇大門之内是一個大規模的羊欄，時常半夜裏聽見慘呌的疑團也同時打破。</p>
<p>昨天回家特别遲，我轉進自家弄堂的時候，前面被一列羊羣阻攔了去路，大約有百數以上，彼此間完全被繩索繫住。爲首的人拉了繩的首端，向大門内拖進後，後面的人把手中的細竹竿在羊身上亂揮。那羣羊彷彿知道這大門以内是個什麽所在，彼此竭力掙扎，傾軋，希望脫離繩和竹竿的惡勢力，那被壓迫的慘呌在秋夜的靜空中使人想起另一種的類似情形。</p>
<p>昨夜我失眠了。平時聽了這慘呌的聲音，我厭惡牠們擾亂我的好夢，在睡眼迷濛中賭氣着翻個身再睡。但今天親見了那種情形，那個拉的人兩脚像擺了打拳莊子似的，遍體的勁力都舒展到兩條粗大的手臂上來，背向後一仰，和地面成了四十度模樣的銳角，那打頭的羊，爲了繩的直接賜與，拉長了頭頸，但是四條腿努力向後退，每一頭羊的恣勢都是這般拚命地奮鬥牠們最後之一着。在這狹小的門口，羊與人在對持着；但是後面竹竿呢，雨點似的打上來，着了竿的忙想退讓，第二鞭却又到了身上，一陣咩咩的慘呌彷彿還在我的耳畔。這樣翻來覆去，整夜没有好睡。</p>
<p>今天早上起來，在窗口望着對面的兩扇大門，我像一個固拗的婦人似的又想到這問題上來，人類眞是殘酷的動物，我自然亦是殘酷的一份子，我雖没有拉過繩，揮過竹竿，但眼睜睜的瞧着這一幕悲劇，而且還有一幕類似的情形呢，當時也不過掩住了自己的耳朶。這樣想着時，我似乎向這一羣懺悔！不由自主地想到羊欄去看一個竟究，昨夜的羊無恙耶？</p>
<p>那個管門的老人很和氣，我告訴了他我的意思，他開了門領我進去。我剛從亮處進來，裏面黑得和地獄一樣，只有一股難聞的氣息從鼻官撲來。站定了脚，才發現屋頂有一塊幾方尺的天窗，這是這羊欄裏惟一的光明了。羊欄面積很大，分了許多栅隔，老人告訴我這就是羊的價格底分别了。總數在五百頭以上，我當然巳不認識昨夜的那羣羊了，或者牠們也巳分門别類作爲主人投資的分配了。每一個栅隔内是十頭羊，許多靑草平舖在牠們面前，牠們都很優遊自得地吃，睡，嬉戲，那種昨夜爭抗的情形，早巳天下太平了。</p>
<p>歸來我很後悔，後悔我做了一次第一號的大傻子，忽然同情起那羣羊來。牠們的掙扎，慘呌，因爲没有知道裏面有美味的靑草。而且人類的把羊作爲食品，正如某一類動物（人包括在内）把人作食品一樣。優勝劣敗是天演的公理，盡天下都做了像我一樣的大傻子也反不過來。想着昨夜的失眠，眞是無謂的損失。</p>
<h3 id="c28">逛公司記 <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>— 洪奔</p>
<p>送了一篇稿子到Ｘ報館，轉出來時候還早，没精打采的瞧了一會書報攤，轉到了抛球塲的電車站，本想趁車歸去了。忽然被對過的Ｘ公司的大减價的熱鬧震動了欲歸的心絃，人，擠得水洩不通，旗旂在樓前招展，軍樂緊急的奏着。所謂大减價，本來一向不與我發生關係，可是，熱鬧我是愛凑的，平常没事的時候，也習慣去逛逛公司，這也許是我的「聊勝於不買」的哲學吧。天然，那兒我是應該去走一趟吧。</p>
<p>這可有些使人難爲情，「跑公司」（忽然想到）先是跑來跑去，東翻西翻，究竟抵不住僱員們的白眼，但是我巳有相當的經騐！！除了東翻西翻之外，總還要考問考問他們的價目，雖則總是「搖頭了之」，也多少可以表示我有一片「想買」的心願，心願是那般的抽象，别人難以窺情，只有自己明白。</p>
<p>當我逛到三樓文房的時候，四分錢買了一本小紀事簿，於是我的掌中也拿着一包貨色，再逛起來，似乎神氣了許多。向樓下走的時候，呵，這眞是天曉得，寬敞的水門汀扶梯，人擠得像一盒針，簡直没有再揷足的餘地。看看情形完全異樣，大衆的眸子都像餓鷹似的，而且竊竊地私語着。這種情形，我素來是不大經意的，老脾氣依然，擠到了二樓的櫃台旁，這才發現了秘密。</p>
<p>「看呀，電影明星陳ＸＸ也來趕大减價了！」這彷彿是一個夥計說的，音帶是異樣的粗暴，我只管兩眼儘量的探索，果然發現陳ＸＸ玉立在前邊的人叢裏，更發現大衆的眼全都投集在伊的身上，形勢是蠻緊張的。</p>
<p>自己很慚愧，終年忙着生活，電影院去不過一二回，可是我對明星們却也有相當的注意，相當的認識，案頭墻璧上有明星玉照的懸掛，更因爲買了一本phopographs貼了好幾位平時所「心嚮往之」的明星小照，這也爲的是老脾氣如此，娘兒們我總是表示好感的。</p>
<p>說到陳ＸＸ，伊雖不是電影皇后，但我却對他表示相當的好感，伊是一個天眞的明星，櫻唇邊的那顆不大不小的黑痣，常使我感到「缺陷的美」。在電影裏我還是半年多以前看過伊主演的一張影片，人品雖是那麽天眞縹緻，但却是一個擅演悲劇片子的主角，從那影片裏可以看得分明，不知使人掉了多少的酸淚。</p>
<p>至於實體的人相，倒不見得怎樣的天眞，縹緲倒還和電影裏表現的差不大多，不，比在電影裏更要縹緻一些，據我看。這也許受了護帶在身旁的愛人（我武斷是伊的愛人）還有一位老婆婆的影響。在這裏伊却表示出一幅詩人的臉相，淡裝輕步，沉靜端莊，這是我見了伊以後的評語。身材也要比在電影裏肥大一些，不，簡直是一個「大塊頭」，肌肉的豐富細潤，確使人那個。</p>
<p>「呵！到底是電影明星！到底是陳ＸＸ！」</p>
<p>我連連的這麽呼喊了兩聲，忽然大家擠着出門了，原來時候巳到了七點，公司快要關門了，我擠出來門，暮色已籠罩了誘惑的南京路，我便在霓紅燈下趁車歸來了。</p>

<p>疲倦和飢餓，使阿福一刻都睡不着了。他伸長着脖子，露出那一雙没有一點神氣的眼睛，望着這黑暗的街上。</p>
<p>在這一條大街上，白天雖然有着成百成千的人走動着，但在這深夜裏，就是死一般的靜寂。黑黝黝地没有一個人影，路心的煤油燈，是很遠很遠的掛着一盞，牠的光芒是昏黄的，微弱的，火燄被風吹得一高一低的忽明明暗，看去好似那亂墳堆上的燐火一般。黑暗和沉寂，佔有着這夜深的街頭。</p>
<p>阿福躡手躡脚的從那黑洞洞地舖廊下爬起來，揉一揉了那疲倦了的餓眼，一步步的在那街上走着。然而飢餓使他没有了舉步的氣力，他的腿好似有千斤的重量，勉强的跑了幾十步，再也不能支持的眼前一陣昏黑，又躺在别一家店的舖廊下去了。</p>
<p>他巳有二整天的没有吃着飯了，這時他雖然感到了過分的疲倦，但那肚子的飢餓，使他只好瞥着雙眼，躺在那舖廊下的水門汀上喘息着，昏迷着。</p>
<p>遠處的鷄鳴，巳經傳到了這沉寂的街上，那街尾的天角，也巳現出了些徼的白色，漸漸地，這街上也有人在走動的聲音。肉舖裏豬的哀鳴，街頭巷尾狗兒的狂吠，相繼的都在響動了。黎明是巳經來到了人間了。</p>
<p>商店都開了門，街上又回復到了熱鬧的世界。</p>
<p>阿福這時也雜在人羣中，慢慢地走着，從前街走到後街，又從後街走到前街。他的那一雙黄色的餓眼，没有轉動的盡是瞧着那些米店的白白的米，麵館裏那熱氣騰騰的鍋子，肚子裏就咕嚕咕嚕的響着。就是那燒餅店的饅頭和燒餅，他想能够吃一個，也是那幸福没有了。</p>
<p>終於他站住在那後街的一家米店的門口，他看着店裏人們在吃早飯，嘴角上就不住的流着泡沫。肚子裏的飢餓，是更加的使他難過了。</p>
<p>他突着那賊眼，看一看了四旁的行人，躡手躡脚的走到了那米店的後門，伸長脖子探到那窗上去望了一下，就推開了門走進去。他這時的心，好似黄豆在那火上烘，一樣的亂跳，手脚都有點顫動不定。「天老爺，只要這一次能够僥倖，下次再不幹了。」他暗自這樣的祝福着。</p>
<p>米，一包一包的堆得好似一個山，阿福的手雖在發抖，但飢餓壓迫着他，使他盡了全身的力量，掮上一大包的米，一溜的就跑出那恐怖之門了。</p>
<p>「捉賊」</p>
<p>一聲呌起來了，阿福的心就着了慌，本來他巳經是餓得没有氣力，肩上又壓着一大包米，脚一軟，就給兩個追捕的人抓住了。</p>
<p>「捉住，别放他走，這幾天街上的失物，都是他偷的。」</p>
<p>「眞是不知死，昨天才在前街偷去了一包米，今天又來了。」</p>
<p>七嘴八嘴的就有人這樣的呌駡着，一般走路的閑人，也都把阿福圍住了。拍拍拍一陣拳頭打在阿福的身上。</p>
<p>太陽高掛在那靑色的天空，牠的光芒，像釘般刺射在阿福的背上，他行一步挨一步的想着：</p>
<p>「爲什麽不把我捉捉去呢？呌我又到什麽地方去吃飯，還有我的妻子？」</p>

<p>咱們没有媽媽。</p>
<p>没有媽媽，可眞是那個。無論那兒都吃虧，吃了虧又没地方訴，那股味兒眞像啞子吃黄蓮。</p>

<p>那些老師們在他背後說：「没娘崽</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>

<p>!」</p>
<p>那些同學們在他前面說：「没娘崽！」</p>
<p>一些狼狽的眼晴射着我弟弟，一些骯髒的唾沫射着我弟弟。</p>
<p>他不抵抗地橫拖着書袋子，逃回來：「哥哥，他們都呌我「没娘崽！」</p>
<p>千萬枝箭兒刺着我的心。淚兒露出在眼眶子裏，又倒流了進去。</p>
<p>我勉强地答應：「不要理他們，弟弟！記着，有一天他們也要做没娘崽」</p>
<p>我弟弟哭着，喊：「媽媽啊！媽媽啊！」突然，他問；「幹嗎我没有媽媽呢？」</p>
<p>唔，幹嗎咱們没有媽媽啊？</p>
<p>每扇門兒在咱們前面關上啦！每個的臉子在咱們前面掉過去啊！</p>
<p>每個說：「倒霉的，碰着了没娘崽！」</p>
<p>每個說：「碰着了没娘崽，倒霉的！」</p>
<p>每個說：「………………！」</p>
<p>千萬枝箭兒剌着咱們的心，淚兒露出在眼眶子裏，又倒流了進去。</p>
<p>夜。</p>
<p>月兒溜進我的房子裏來，寂寞地望着我，望着壁上我的孤零丁的影子。</p>
<p>咽，咽，咽，—讓白天裏忍着的淚兒儘流出來！—咽，咽，咽。</p>
<p>「幹嗎咱們没有媽媽啊？」</p>
<p>回答我的，是黑暗的沉默。</p>
<p>悄悄地跑到媽媽的屋子裏：吻着媽媽睡過的牀兒，吻着媽媽睡過的枕兒，……</p>
<p>「告訴我，幹嗎咱們没有媽媽啊」</p>
<p>是黑暗的沉默，回答我的。</p>
<p>咽，咽，咽，—咽，咽，咽。</p>
<p>陡的，我瞧見媽媽躺在牀子上：她瘦得差不離跟埃及的木乃伊一樣。她的臉兒怪黝黑的，並且抽搐着。一層薄皮兒包着高高地聳起的觀骨。………驀地，她咬着她的柴兒般胳膊：「啊，讓我快點死了吧！害了這許多特病……」接着，她便閉了眼睛！</p>
<p>「媽媽！媽媽！」我弟弟的聲音。</p>
<p>媽媽没有了，是我弟弟躺着在這個牀上！</p>
<p>「别哭，弟弟！媽媽永遠不會回來了。你記好：媽媽是怎麽死的。媽媽是給生活壓死的！多年靑啊！咱們準不要再走她走的那條路。」</p>
<p>「我要媽媽啊！」</p>
<p>我把個枕兒放在他旁邊，讓他偎着牠：「喏，弟弟！媽媽喏！」</p>

<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>鳳雲叔叔並不說話，只顧吸水烟。水烟袋總因爲大髒的原故，吸起來茲茲的響，很費力似的。時敏這時候從高凳子上爬下來，照例的，有客人來了，便是他偷懶的機會。關於這方面，他從來就有一個很好的法門：當客人來了的時候，他便放大噪子唸書，一股剌耳的尖聲，簡直就使人說話都不能聽見，於是他的父親便不能不敎他暫時停止一下，那末，不消說，他很快自書桌旁依在父親的身邊，靜聽客人談話，有時客人只談一些年成好不好之類的事，枯燥得很，他竟趁此機會跑到外面玩兒去了。但是他今天並没有使用這種方法，他簡直就一看見客人來，便不讀書了。</p>
<p>鳳雲叔一連抽了好幾袋烟，其後慢呑呑的說：</p>
<p>「那末你是每天看上海報的，報紙上也没有什麽消息嗎？」</p>
<p>「你說是關於革命黨的消息嗎？」父親說：「那當然是不敢登載的。不過捉革命黨的事，却是時常有的。」</p>
<p>「不過天下是一定要大亂的。前幾天，就聽說狗生角，雛生脚的事，昨天我把自己家裏的雞一隻一隻的看了一下，就有兩隻是生了脚的，後來我都殺來吃了。」</p>
<p>「雞生脚？雞總是有脚的囉。」父親覺得鳳雲叔的話大可笑了。可是鳳雲却回答着說：</p>
<p>「唉，誰說雞没有脚的呢？我所說的雞生脚，是雞的翅膀裏多生了兩隻脚呀？」</p>
<p>「哦！有這樣的事嗎？這可奇怪了。」</p>
<p>時敏一聽到這裏，便奇怪得什麽似的跑到廚房裏去了，大聲嚷着：</p>
<p>「姑媽！快來，快來看看家裏的雞，翅膀裏多生了兩隻脚没有？」</p>
<p>這裏鳳雲叔也和大先生說：</p>
<p>「假使有了多生脚的雞，就殺來吃了罷，留着妖孽在家裏總是麻煩的」</p>
<p>不久，便聽見捉雞的聲音，有的是嚇得跑了，有的是在姑媽手裏掙扎得怪可憐的。其後，姑媽捉了兩隻從走廊裏到廳子裏來，問鳳雲叔說：</p>
<p>「翅膀裏那有什麽脚？没有呀，你看！」</p>
<p>「那也許是你家裏的没有，不過給我看看。」他接過雞翻轉牠的翅膀在尋着，「瞧，這不是脚嗎？這個小小的肉痣一樣的東西。」</p>
<p>啊，就是這個嗎？」姑媽說：「那末每隻雞都是有的呀。不相信，我們來看這一隻罷，也是有的。……瞧，是吧？不也是每個翅膀裏都有一粒嗎？」</p>

<h3 id="e1">Prospects of Franco-Italian Rapprochement <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Heng</p>
<p>Foreign dispatches recently reported extensively that France and Italy are about to establish an agreement to jointly prevent Germany's aggression against Austria. At the same time, France and Italy have also made concessions on colonial issues and naval equality. It is said that Italy is also prepared to abandon its demands for revising the peace treaty. Whether this statement is reliable remains to be verified. However, judging from the fact that French Foreign Minister Barthou will visit Rome in October, the two countries' efforts to approach each other seem impossible to conceal.</p>
<p>Since Hitler came to power in Germany, French diplomacy has often been victorious. First, the cooperation between the Little Entente and France has become increasingly solid. Second, Soviet Russia has gradually joined hands with France. Third, Britain has slightly changed its attitude of suppressing France. If it can coordinate with Italy today, then all European countries will be allies of France. Germany, isolated in between, will become even more powerless. However, this matter is of great importance, and its success may not be as easy to achieve as the Franco-Russian alliance. France and Italy both possess blocs on the European continent, and the interests of the blocs they possess are in a contradictory position. Therefore, the cooperation between France and Italy must also involve the cooperation of the Little Entente and Austria-Hungary simultaneously. To make the Little Entente and Austria-Hungary cooperate, the restoration movement in Austria must also be resolved simultaneously, and Hungary's demands for revision must be eliminated. This is one aspect. Furthermore, after France and Italy implement naval equality and diplomatic cooperation, the British navy will inevitably be somewhat threatened in the Mediterranean Sea. Britain cannot but be concerned about this. If it is indeed confirmed that Italy will no longer support Germany's demands for rearmament, then Britain's arms reduction plan will inevitably be completely abandoned. Therefore, although the combination of France and Italy is purely aimed at Germany, its result will inevitably affect the position of Britain. This is another aspect.</p>
<p>From these two points, it can be seen that the combination of France and Italy cannot be achieved solely based on the will of the two parties concerned. Therefore, the recent European dispatches can only be regarded as an expression of the willingness of France and Italy to approach each other. The key to success lies in how the existing relationship between the Little Entente and Austria-Hungary can be adjusted and resolved, and how Britain's concerns can be dispelled. If the former cannot be properly resolved, the crisis in Central Europe cannot be avoided. If the latter's concerns are not eliminated, Britain may return to a pro-German policy. If so, not only will the success or failure of the Eastern European Pact be affected, but also the Far Eastern issue will become more complicated with Britain's pro-German stance. The importance of the relationship is self-evident. With Barthou's keen insight and competence, he should not act rashly.</p>
<p>In short, the combination of France and Italy is possible under the threat of Germany today. However, France must first seek the opinions of the Little Entente and Britain in advance in order to handle it properly. Otherwise, it will be difficult to succeed.</p>

<p>Bi-Weekly Memorial Report</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Party Headquarters held the 147th Bi-Weekly Memorial Service at 9:00 AM on the 10th. Members of the Central Committee, including Ye Chucang, Lin Sen, Chen Lifu, Li Zonghuang, Li Ciwen, Ji Liang, Gu Zhenggang, Wang Qi, and staff, totaling over 400 people, attended. Ye Chucang chaired the meeting and gave a report explaining the methods for political examinations for staff members within the Central Party Headquarters. As the talk was intended for internal staff, it will not be published. The meeting adjourned at 9:30 AM. (Central News Agency dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held a bi-weekly memorial service on the morning of the 10th. Chen Shaokuan, Wang Yongbin, Chen Qicai, Cao Haosen, Chen Xunyong, Lü Chao, Wei Huai, and other officials from various ministries and departments, totaling 300 people, attended. After Chairman Lin led the ceremony, he gave a speech, stating that the Three Principles of the People contained a broad range of ideas. The simple explanation of people's livelihood is that humans must strive for survival and must have the greatest spirit to strive in order to achieve the purpose of survival. In a narrow sense, for individuals, the starting points of the spirit of struggle are: (1) to be self-reliant; (2) to contribute abilities to society and the nation. This is the way for us to save the country. When we engage in this work, we should first establish a moral foundation and then expand our abilities to struggle. The method should be practical and scientific. The New Life Movement, which is now being implemented in a military, rational, and productive manner, aims to promote the scientific cooperation of all aspects of our lives. For example, advocating for domestic goods is one aspect of saving the country. We should try our best to purchase domestic goods for daily necessities to stop national financial leaks. It is hoped that colleagues will extend this to the family and do it together. (Central News Agency dispatch, 10th)</p>

<p>Defeated Bandits in Luo County Can Be Eliminated in the Short Term</p>

The military deployment in Songxi and Zhenghe counties is very dense. Hundreds of bandits, under the pressure of our army's suppression, fled into Songxi in panic, attempting to attack the county seat.

<p>US Treasury Department Denies</p>
<p>Ban on Private Silver Imports</p>
<p>Li Ming Discusses Rising Silver Prices</p>
<p>China Seriously Affected</p>
<p>(Washington) It is claimed that rumors in Shanghai that the United States will ban the import of privately owned silver have been strongly denied by the Treasury Department today. A Treasury Department spokesperson told the Associated Press that such news is completely unfounded. Similar rumors also appeared in New York in the middle of last week. The government really doesn't know how they started. The Treasury Department is still implementing its announced silver policy as usual. However, foreign parties want to hinder the United States' monetary policy, so they spread rumors. As far as the Treasury Department knows, there is absolutely no such action, nor is there any intention to take such action. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(New York) Li Ming, a leader in the Chinese banking community, said in an interview with the Associated Press today that rising silver prices are harmful to China. Its impact is similar to the situation in the United States before President Roosevelt devalued the dollar. Li also said that China's purchasing power should not be measured by the amount of silver reserves, but by China's production and export power. Now, both are seriously affected by rising silver prices. (National, 9th)</p>

<p>Unveiling of Briand Memorial</p>
<p>French Foreign Minister Speaks on Foreign Policy</p>
<p>Advocacy for Maintaining Peace Receives Understanding from All Parties</p>
<p>Refusing Russia's Entry into the League of Nations Would Be a Major Mistake</p>
<p>Landia, France - Briand, the famous French politician and writer, passed away during the European War. A memorial has now been erected for him, and the unveiling ceremony was held today. Foreign Minister Barthou rushed from Geneva to participate and deliver a speech, saying that the policy of peace, in itself, is an end, and should not be regarded as a means. The situation in Geneva is quite difficult. My speech in Geneva was somewhat激昂, but sometimes what is in my mind must be clearly stated. On June 10th of this year, I proposed a compromise proposal at the Disarmament Conference, which was endorsed by the United Kingdom and the United States, and passed by the entire committee of the General Committee. Only two countries did not agree. At that time, the United Kingdom saw the French compromise proposal and was able to understand France's desire to maintain peace. Later, in early July, I crossed the sea to England to explain the reasons for France's attitude to the British authorities. After 48 hours of explanation, the two countries completely agreed (i.e., the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact plan). When we speak in the name of France, when some proposals related to European peace are recognized by the three major powers, and we invite the Little Entente countries, which are closely related to continental peace, to participate, we can be full of confidence. Barthou then said that the United Kingdom and the Little Entente countries' proposals will surely be implemented. He said, "Since we have sent ambassadors to the capital of a country, and have established normal relations with a country, then what has already been recognized should not be regretted. It would be a major political mistake not to allow a country with a population of 180 million to join the international community. This country is happy to join the League of Nations, has recognized the charter of the League of Nations, is happy to abide by it, and asks to enjoy all the rights and privileges that all member states of the League of Nations should enjoy. It is incomprehensible if we refuse it. There is one thing I must tell you, when I first mentioned the word 'security', the first person to express sympathy to me was Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov. This is something I cannot forget. Now that Soviet Russia has openly recognized equal rights and has recognized the obligation to abide by everything, the same as all other countries, at this time, it is incomprehensible to us if people in general adopt an attitude towards Soviet Russia that is contrary to that of France." After the speech, the audience applauded warmly, and Barthou immediately returned to Geneva by car. (Havas Telegram, 9th)</p>

<p>German Foreign Office Issues Declaration</p>
<p>Refutes the Saar Commission's Accusations</p>
<p>(Berlin) The German Foreign Office issued an official declaration today in response to the Saar Governing Commission's previous accusations regarding the German Workers' Service Corps in the Saar region. In its declaration today, the German Foreign Office denied that the Saar Governing Commission was able to provide evidence to prove that the workers' group had military characteristics. It said that the basis of the rumor was due to a misunderstanding of a letter issued by the group's German supervisor on October 6 of last year. The common "Saar Struggle Movement" only refers to the struggle for the Saar and has no other meaning. The Saar Governing Commission has inappropriately attached a military meaning to it. In fact, the members of the so-called Workers' Service Corps are all young people who have not received military training, nor is there any plan to provide military training. Therefore, the German Foreign Office feels that it is necessary to protest the various activities of the Saar Governing Commission, which are based on inaccurate speculation and create a false image of the German Workers' Service Corps.

<p>At the Naval Preparatory Meeting</p>
<p>Japan Will Demand Treaty Abolition</p>
<p>Delegation Departs for England Soon</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to news here today, Japan will propose a new plan to reduce armaments at the naval talks to be held in London. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Matsudaira and Rear Admiral Yamamoto will depart for the United States on September 20th, and then to London as Japanese representatives to attend the naval talks. Akiyama, secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, will be one of the members of the Japanese delegation and will go to London via Siberia on the 22nd of this month. It is reported that the Japanese representatives will demand the establishment of a new treaty to replace the Washington Naval Treaty and the abolition of naval ratios, and will declare that Japan has no intention of engaging in unnecessary naval competition. The Japanese government wants a navy that is sufficient for national defense needs but not enough to attack others. Therefore, Japan is prepared to dismantle its offensive weapons if other countries agree. The political circles here hope that other countries can cooperate sincerely with Japan to establish a new treaty. (Reuters Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>Japanese Naval Budget</p>
<p>Guidelines for the Ministry of Finance's Review</p>
<p>The House of Peers Chants Again for Tax Increase</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Finance's Budget Bureau is reviewing the naval budget, the most difficult hurdle, first, and it will take another day or two to complete. The naval budget has a fixed expenditure of 420 million yuan and a new request for 290 million yuan, totaling a huge 710 million yuan. All of its expenditures are deemed necessary and indispensable. However, from the viewpoint of Japan's poor finances, it cannot be fully approved. Therefore, based on the following three guidelines, a considerable amount of reduction will be resolutely implemented: (1) In principle, although the entire plan is approved, the total amount of expenditures must be considerably reduced; (1) For shipbuilding technology that takes a considerable amount of time to complete, a large amount of expenditures can be included, but for materials that can be completed quickly, savings must be made; (1) The unit price must be rationalized, and military-industrial companies cannot obtain undue benefits. Minister of Finance Fujii aims to achieve a sense of security through diplomatic work to promote international peace and ensure national defense, but he must try his best to seek the understanding of the cabinet members and not allow fiscal and domestic affairs to lose their balance. (Dentsu Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Members of the House of Peers, such as Sugawara Michitaka, Katsuta, and Maeda Toshisada, have been advocates of tax increases. They made a request at the time of the previous cabinet, but Minister of Finance Takahashi refuted it, saying that resolutely increasing taxes would endanger the thriving industry and cause it to wither. At that time, the House of Peers had to remain silent because its opponent was the elder of the financial community. Now that Fujii, the Minister of Finance of the new cabinet, still advocates that it is too early to increase taxes, the House of Peers has expressed dissatisfaction. Therefore, the theory of resolutely increasing taxes has resurfaced. It seems that Finance Minister Fujii will not take any action on the tax increase issue regarding the budget compilation methods, and the House of Peers advocates immediately increasing taxes to make the people aware of the extraordinary finances.

<p>British Pan-Fascists and Opposition</p>
<p>Rally and Demonstrate in London</p>
<p>6,000 Armed Police Conduct Preemptive Defense</p>
<p>Clashes Break Out Between Two Factions, Sixteen Arrested</p>
<p>(London) An unprecedented demonstration was held at Hyde Park today. Fascists and anti-fascists gathered separately, totaling over 100,000 people. Riots then broke out, and several people were injured. However, the police were still able to maintain order. The Fascists, followers of Sir Mosley, gathered in one place to listen to the leaders of their party speak. A hundred yards away were the Communist and labor masses. About 2,000 police surrounded the masses, and another 5,000 were ready to move out at any time. There were several disturbances during the rally. The most serious was when the anti-fascists tried to break through the other side's rally, resulting in eleven injuries. When Sir Mosley gave his speech, the Communists sang loudly so that the masses could not hear him, and then threw rotten fruit and bricks. At the same time, the Fascists also broke through the police line and attacked the other side. Thus, the two sides fought in a melee. An hour later, the police were finally able to disperse the masses and arrest sixteen ringleaders. As of 7:00 PM, order has been restored. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) British Fascists and Anti-Fascists held rallies in Hyde Park at the same time. The police took strict preemptive measures to maintain calm. At noon, the Anti-Fascists first arrived in the park, with banners leading the way, marching in formation from the suburbs. Cavalry police escorted them on both sides. Before long, the Fascists, all wearing black shirts, gathered at Marble Arch near the park, with coal carts set up around them, like a camp. At the same time, it was also a platform for speakers. The two sides were only 200 meters apart. 6,000 police, riding horses, on foot, and in cars, were densely packed between the two factions to prevent incidents. The number of police was unprecedented. About 50,000 people along the road, many of whom were leisurely civilians, reversing the habit of going to the countryside for rest at the end of the week, driven by curiosity, gathered to watch. The public mostly adopted a mocking attitude towards the Fascist troops, and sometimes expressed hostility. There were a few people in the crowd with black Swastika badges on their arms, who were ridiculed by the public. The Fascist rally was peaceful, reflecting the noise of the Anti-Fascists. At 6:05 PM, Sir Mosley, the leader of the Fascist Party, arrived in uniform. 5,000 party members raised their hands to their foreheads in ancient Roman style to salute the leader. Seven party members then climbed onto the coal trucks to deliver speeches, but the speeches were only heard by party members because Anti-Fascists constantly shouted and cursed. These people attempted to attack the Fascists, but were stopped by the police. Sir Mosley concluded his speech by saying that the power of British Fascism has overcome the attempts to destroy the Red Party. Finally, the demonstrators from both sides dispersed under the supervision of the police, and the order was good. The public was very interested in the situation. Some parodied the Fascists' salute, while others shouted abuse, and some were silent and indifferent, seemingly unaffected. (Havas Telegram, 9th)</p>

<p>US Mail Ship Accident Case</p>
<p>Full Investigation of the Truth Begins</p>
<p>Suspected Arson</p>
<p>Number of Victims Over Two Hundred</p>
<p>Relatives Identify Bodies, Scene is Tragic</p>
<p>(New York) The Moro Castle accident case began to be investigated by the central government this morning. This is a preliminary hearing. The public hopes that this will prove whether the various rumors caused by the ship's fire are true. Some passengers accused the crew of ignoring the cries for help from passengers struggling in the water or trapped on the ship. There are also rumors that the fire was caused by arson, and the accelerant used was a bomb. Fires broke out in several places at the same time. Others said that it took 45 minutes to send out an emergency call after the fire was discovered. The questions to be studied in this morning's investigation include why the automatic fire extinguishing machine was not used, why the water pressure was so low, why the belt broke under low pressure, why only eight of the twelve lifeboats on the ship were lowered, and these eight were mostly occupied by the crew, etc. According to O'Sullivan, the person in charge of the deck, the fire drill on the entire ship is divided into five zones. The drill is only conducted weekly in the two zones visible to passengers, and the other three zones are not held. It has been heard that the Moro Castle had a fire a few days earlier, but it was extinguished by the crew without difficulty. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>(New York) The committee investigating the Moro Castle mail ship disaster met for the first time this morning. It started with the ship's acting captain, Huamus, testifying that he suspected that the tragedy that happened to the Moro Castle on Saturday morning was due to arson. The investigation is a preliminary hearing to gather testimony. The public hopes to determine whether the various rumors about the ship's fire are credible. When the ship caught fire, it was the first mate Huamus who was acting as captain, because Captain Weimar had died of a heart attack before the fire. (Reuters Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>(New York) This morning, there was a huge explosion on the Moro Castle mail ship, and sparks and debris shot into the sky. Those searching for corpses could not board the ship. The explosion occurred at the rear and center of the ship. Before the explosion, there was a huge cracking sound, as if part of the deck had sunk into the cabin. At that time, the smoke stack spewed smoke, and flames shot out from the cracks in the iron plates near the bow of the ship. (Reuters Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>(New York) The tragic burning of the US mail ship "Moro Castle" is being investigated here today. At the same time, relatives and friends of the victims came to Asbury Park to identify the bodies. According to the Associated Press, a total of 186 bodies have been recovered, and 27 people are still missing. It is likely that all hope is lost. Therefore, the number of deaths in this tragedy will reach 213. A total of 554 passengers and crew members were on board, and 341 were rescued. Asbury Park was originally a resort, but today it is full of people with tragic faces, looking at the bodies one by one. Countless curious people gathered on the coast to see the burning of the Moro Castle. It is estimated that more than 200,000 people came to watch.

<p>Russia Enters the League of Nations</p>
<p>Japan is Highly Vigilant</p>
<p>Russia's Relationship with Britain and France Will Become Closer</p>
<p>Will Deal with the East with a Strong Attitude</p>
<p>Osaka Mainichi Newspaper on the 5th of this month reported: The long-pending issue of Russia joining the League of Nations, and the Eastern Locarno Treaty, which is closely related to it, are now gradually taking concrete form.  Our Foreign Affairs authorities (referring to Japan) believe that Russia's actions in the Far East hereafter are very important.  According to reports from various sources, Russia's joining the League is almost certain.  The League Council on the 8th unanimously approved it. Although there are objections from a few countries, it has already obtained more than two-thirds of the agreement, so there is no problem. However, after Russia joins the League of Nations, the consequences will have the greatest impact on Japan: (1) Russia and France will become closer and closer. After concluding the Russia-France Accord and the Eastern Locarno Treaty, Russia's western border will be more secure, and it will focus on dealing with Japan and actively engaging in activities in the Far East. (2) After Russia joins the League, it will be bound by the League's non-recognition of "Manchukuo."  It will also be increasingly unwilling to recognize Manchuria, the counterpart in the negotiations for the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway, due to related reasons.  On the other hand, a major turning point will also occur in European international politics, that is, France will be able to establish hegemony in the League, strengthening the power of the European League.  Due to the advancement of French power, Germany's desire to return to the League and resume the disarmament conference will be even more hopeless, and the opposition between Germany and the League will become more intense. On the other hand, internal opposition is bound to arise in the International Labour Organization. In the past, the Soviet government considered the League of Nations to be an organization for capitalism to confront socialism, so its government newspaper vigorously rejected the League. However, in the past one or two years, Russia's anti-League attitude has gradually softened, gradually advancing and joining the League as a permanent member. This change in attitude is due to Russia's assessment of the changing international situation, in other words: (1) Due to the rise of the National Socialist Party, relations with Russia are deteriorating day by day. At the same time, since the Manchurian Incident, relations with Japan have also been very tense. (2) Since Stalin succeeded Lenin, he has focused on domestic construction and strived for peace externally in order to achieve the Five-Year Plan. On the one hand, he has suppressed the Comintern's communization activities, which has been welcomed by the League of Nations. However, the Russian government and the Comintern have the same principles and goals, so from a principle point of view, Russia's desire to break the Comintern's combination is self-contradictory. Its joining the League now is originally a temporary tactic, so some knowledgeable people still doubt whether Russia's joining the League can be sustained. In general, Russia wants to complete its Five-Year Plan, so it is taking this expedient measure. However, if Russia joins the League of Nations, its relationship with Britain and France will inevitably become closer, and it can promote the conclusion of the Eastern Locarno Treaty. Its international position in the West will be stronger and more secure. It will definitely deal with the East with its strong attitude. The international situation will suddenly develop, which is actually of great importance to Japan.</p>
<p>Li Sihai</p>
<p>Calmly Died for His Country in Harbin</p>
<p>Requested to Face South for Execution to Witness the Success of the Suicide Squad</p>
<p>Shouted "Long Live the Nation," and the People of the Northeast All Wept</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: Li Donghai (i.e., Li Sihai)'s troops, who attacked vehicles along the Siping-Taonan, Chinese Eastern, and Qiqihar-Ang'angxi railways, were involved in an incident of attacking a rebel military train at Xiaojiuzhan on the eastern line of Harbin.  More than 40 members of his unit were surrounded by Japanese and puppet troops at Sijingzi in Qidong and were all arrested and detained in the Japanese military headquarters in Harbin. After several non-judicial tortures and interrogations, he only confessed that he was from Fuxin in Rehe. After the September 18th Incident, he followed someone to participate in national salvation work, and there were no other confessions. When the Japanese army searched, they found several newly issued symbols of the National Suicide Squad. When asked about the purpose of sabotaging the train, he confessed: Our country is destroyed and our homes are broken, and saving the country is a personal responsibility. Overturning the train is one of the national salvation work. If heaven grants us life, we will unite the people, organize the people, and restore the lost land, and it will not be limited to overturning the train. When asked about the organization of the Suicide Squad, he replied that a gathering of ten comrades who are not afraid of death can desperately risk their lives. The organization is self-reliant, but we do not bother to rely on foreign aid. All compatriots of the Republic of China are our backing. When asked about their leader, he firmly refused to tell the truth, only saying: Now that we have been arrested, we will die. Our place of death today is also your place of death in the future. Japanese soldiers slapped his cheeks with leather belts, and blood flowed like a river. When asked about the headquarters of the organization, he replied that it was in Tianshan. When asked for further details, he said that wherever ten comrades who sympathize with our work gather, that is our headquarters. When the Japanese army finally bound Li and sent him for execution by shooting, Li generously stepped forward, shouted "Long Live the Chinese Nation," and requested to face south for execution so that he could witness the success of our Suicide Squad in the afterlife. The people of the Northeast all wept at Li's martyrdom, and his generous death had the legacy of our ancient philosopher Wen Tianxiang.</p>
<p>Luandong</p>
<p>Puppet Plainclothes Troops Crawling</p>
<p>Liu Guitang Plots to Seize Tangshan</p>
<p>Zhao Dazhong Lies in Ambush to Incite</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The remnants of the Luandong puppet plainclothes troops, after being defeated by the militia of Zunhua, Qianxi, Jixian, and Yutian counties, fled to the border between Xinglong and Zunhua counties. The provincial government, in order to cut off the roots, ordered Wei Yonghe's Third Security Regiment stationed in Jixian County to suppress them. Knowing that they could not resist, the puppet troops had already divided into groups of twenty or thirty people to hide everywhere. However, reports were received yesterday and today that Shi Yousan and Liu Guitang's ambition to cause chaos in the local area has not died. Recently, they have sent die-hard followers to Yutian and Tangshan to carry out activities. Liu Guitang's father-in-law, Zhang, personally went to Yutian to contact Feng Shouchun, the captain of the special task force of the local security reinforcement team, enticing him with the benefits of cooperation. Shi Yousan used Zhao Dazhong, a traitor who incited miners of the Kailuan Mines to strike in Tangshan this spring, and Ono, a Japanese, to incite and instigate the workers in Tangshan to riot together. There are dozens of large and small groups of puppet forces near Yutian and Tangshan, each group consisting of twenty to thirty people or more. Ono is secretly transporting guns and ammunition for replenishment at any time and anywhere. In addition, most of Liu Guitang's remnants in Shandong have secretly gone to the Northeast to hide. Now that Liu has something planned, he is still sending people to summon them. Daily, they secretly transport them by airship from Yingkou and Dalian, mostly landing in Luandong, and then being distributed to the vicinity of Tangshan and Yutian to hide and gather. Another part is going to Jiaodong, Longkou, and Zhifu to gather. The transportation is currently underway. According to official reports, Shi and Liu intend to start from Luandong and Jiaodong separately, so that our government cannot allocate defenses. If one side succeeds, they will take it as a base. It is reported that Zhao Dazhong secretly arrived in Yutian on the 7th of this month. Without stopping, he turned to Tangshan. Recently, he has been protected by a dozen traitors, and accompanied by a Japanese, he has begun activities. During the Kailuan Five Mines workers' strike this spring, quite a few workers were misled by Zhao and listened to his commands to make things difficult for the government and the mining bureau. Most of them were forced to blindly follow the small number of traitors who were attached to him. As time passed, the relationship with Zhao gradually cooled down, so it may not be as easy for Zhao to incite the workers this time as it was last time. Zhao Xun, the director of the Tangshan Public Security Bureau, and Zhao Lei, the captain of the Second Security Team of the war zone, have successively received orders from the provincial government and the Beiping Military Branch to strictly prevent and control the situation. From the 5th of this month, the Public Security Bureau cooperated with the Security Team to implement temporary martial law, searching pedestrians and hotels to prevent problems before they occur. However, it is also heard that there are quite a few left-leaning elements among the miners in Tangjiazhuang Mine. Wang Xia, the leader of the Soviet communists, is currently hiding in Xugezhuang, engaging in secret incitement. Communist propaganda has been repeatedly discovered in various mines in recent days. Although the mine area security team is strictly preventing it, they cannot completely stop it, so the degree of danger is increasing day by day. More than 20,000 Kailuan miners can control the security of eastern Tangshan, and there are certainly many who want to take advantage of them. (7th)</p>
<p>Japanese People Travel to Nanchang in Droves</p>
<p>—Military and Police Authorities Ordered to Protect Them—</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: According to reliable sources, about a week ago, Koshihira Katsuji, a Japanese consultant of the Nanxun Railway Bureau, along with three people, including the chief of the police station of the Japanese Consulate in Xun, came to Nanchang to travel and visit the Qingyunpu scenic area. On the 1st of this month, the Jiujiang Municipal Committee also received a letter from the Japanese Consulate in Xun, stating that Japanese residents Ishii Torao and Ishii Yonekichiro planned to travel to Nanchang one after another. They requested that their passports be endorsed to facilitate their quick journey. In addition to following the procedure and replying to the letter, the Municipal Committee specifically telegraphed the military and police agencies in Nanchang to investigate and protect them. However, in recent years, Japanese people have often made trips to Nanchang, and Sima Zhao's intentions are known to all. Therefore, the military and police authorities have ordered them to verify their documents and supervise them according to regulations when the two Japanese residents arrive in the area.

<p>Communist Bandit Areas in Jiangxi Province</p>
<p>The People Are Becoming Increasingly Aware</p>
<p>Captured Bandit Xin Keming Describes the Current Situation in the Bandit Areas</p>
<p>Xiao Zhiping Telegraphs That Lantian and Surrounding Areas Have Been Recovered</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The Commander-in-Chief’s Office recently quoted captured bandit Xin Keming as describing the lack of supplies in the bandit areas bordering Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces, as well as the dispersal of the people. This shows the reason for the collapse of the Red Bandits. The following is an excerpt from Xin's original confession: "Therefore, the bandit areas have been collapsing more and more recently. The masses have risen up to resist, and most of the ten local despots caught recently have not paid their dues, resulting in a lack of military funds. Now the bandit leaders are panicking. The source of supplies is cut off under the blockade of the National Army, and there is no cash to buy them, so it is becoming increasingly cut off. However, the Red Bandits are only trying their best to force and deceive the masses to shake their shares and open cooperatives, using the people in the border areas to collect and transport oil, salt, and daily necessities. Recently, the rapid collapse of the bandit areas bordering Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces is mainly due to the awareness of the bandits and their unwillingness to live inhuman lives under the oppression of the bandit leaders. Therefore, they are constantly dragging their guns and surrendering to the National Army. At the same time, the masses in the bandit areas cannot bear the oppression and exploitation of the Red Bandits, especially the rural laborers, who are completely forced to serve as Red Bandits, resulting in barren farmland and the displacement of the people in the countryside. On the other hand, the bandits are inhumane, and they only take murder and arson as commonplace. Under these circumstances, the bandits and the people are becoming increasingly aware, so that in the midst of the National Army's crackdown, the bandit army is becoming increasingly isolated. This is the main factor in the collapse of the bandits bordering Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces."</p>
<p>Xiao Zhiping's branch (4th) telegram stated that this division attacked the bandit fort on the high ground northwest of Lantian Market this morning. The bandits stubbornly resisted at every turn, but our army advanced bravely and finally defeated the bandits, who fled to the southwest of Lantian Market, and occupied eight bandit forts in that area. One puppet regimental commander and three or four hundred bandit soldiers were killed in this battle, and five rifles were seized, etc. (8th)</p>
<p>Residual Bandits in Anyuan, Jiangxi</p>
<p>Forcibly Collect Farmers' Rice</p>
<p>Fujian West Defense Forces Annihilate Bandits in Denglong Ridge</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the Communist bandits in southern Jiangxi were strictly blockaded and surrounded by armies from all directions, supplies were cut off in the bandit areas, and they occasionally used local people to steal and transport grain. Recently, due to the ripening of the autumn rice, scattered bandits have emerged in the fields again, inciting ignorant farmers. The garrison in Anyuan recently reported that the remnants of the Communist bandits had fled to Guankeng, which belongs to Anyuan, and were forcing the masses to plunder grain. They immediately sent troops to encircle and suppress them. On the 30th of last month, a 囗 regiment, together with the Anxi Anti-Communist Group, advanced towards Guankeng and confronted the bandits for a long time before defeating them, killing one puppet company commander, one puppet political commissar, and more than 20 bandit soldiers, rescuing two kidnapped hostages, Huang Shiyang's father and daughter, and seizing 15 bandit rifles and more than ten spears. After the bandits retreated, the officers and soldiers began to protect the Anxi farmers in harvesting rice.</p>
<p>In western Fujian, the Guangdong army's blockade of the bandit areas in eastern Jiangxi is quite effective. The Fujian Western People's Group led by Zhong Shaokui has been reorganized into the First Detachment of the Fujian Western Guerrilla Force and stationed in □□ to search for and suppress residual communists. At the end of last month, the team was reported to have found bandits hiding in Denglong Ridge, and a false first sub-district command of the Fujian Military Region and a false independent battalion guard company model company were established. The bandit group, numbering about 400 people, occasionally emerged in nearby villages to steal grain. Zhong's team rushed to suppress them. After three hours of fierce fighting, dozens of bandits were killed, one false acting director of the Ying County Soviet and one false chairman of the Lufeng District Soviet were captured, and the false command organization was destroyed. One red flag of the false independent battalion and a large bundle of confidential documents were seized. (5th)</p>
<p>Fuzhou</p>
<p>Gambling Houses are Extremely Popular</p>
<p>No Less Than a Dozen in the Entire City</p>
<p>All Opened by Taiwanese People</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The trend of gambling houses has been extremely popular in Minyuan recently. In total, there are no less than a dozen in the entire city, all opened by Japanese Taiwanese. Most of them are open three times a day, at 12:00 noon, 5:00 pm, and 10:00 pm. Some of them are open twice a day, at noon and in the evening, or in the evening and at night. Each round has hundreds of people betting, and thousands of people betting a lot, especially in the evening. Among them, the Xingji Foreign Firm in Huaidefang, the Xinlong Foreign Firm in Wenzaoshan, and the Showa Foreign Firm in Nanmendou have the largest venues. Every time the round is opened, the bettors fill the road, and traffic is cut off. There are also a dozen Taiwanese people carrying pistols to protect the venue, and their fierce arrogance is unbearable. It has been found that large venues can make a profit of three or four hundred yuan a day, and small venues can also make a profit of one or two hundred yuan. Men and women in the middle and lower classes of society lose their minds due to gambling and seek help from gods and Buddhas everywhere. No matter what kind of desolate ancient temple, people pray for dreams and make words. Even places like Jigao Lane (mountain name), the execution ground outside the West Gate, and the Maze Cave, the demon lair of Wushi Mountain, which timid people dare not go to on weekdays, are now visited by hundreds of people every night to pray for dreams. Men and women are mixed together, and their ugly behavior is fully exposed. Every evening, no matter on the main streets or alleys, whenever you see pedestrians in groups of three or five, what they talk about is nothing but gambling houses. Recently, women have committed suicide almost every day because they lost gambling and were unable to pay off their debts or were afraid of being questioned by their families. Public opinion is deeply dissatisfied with the silence and indulgence of the officials. The County Party Affairs Guidance Committee and the New Life Movement Promotion Association have repeatedly petitioned the government to find a way to prohibit it. The Nanchang Commander-in-Chief’s Office also issued a notice to Fujian to investigate and ban it based on reports from various sources. For this reason, the provincial government has specially formulated the Interim Regulations on Punishing Special Gambling in the hope of eliminating the gambling trend. It stipulates that those who engage in opening gambling houses shall be sentenced to death or imprisonment for more than ten years and may be fined up to 8,000 yuan. Those who work in gambling houses shall be sentenced to imprisonment for more than three years and less than seven years and may be fined up to 5,000 yuan. Those who gather crowds to resist officers and soldiers by opening gambling houses or seek shelter from foreigners shall be sentenced to death. Military police and officials who harbor and protect gambling houses shall also be sentenced to death. The regulations were promulgated and implemented on the 2nd. From the 3rd, the Public Security Bureau has dispatched a large number of detectives and arrested more than a dozen Chinese partners used in the gambling houses, and decided to severely punish them. The rest are still being investigated. As for how to ban and close the gambling houses opened by Taiwanese people in order to fundamentally eliminate the gambling trend, it is still under consideration and negotiation. (September 3rd)</p>
<p>Henan Province</p>
<p>Run on the Agricultural and Industrial Bank</p>
<p>——The Situation Has Gradually Stabilized After the Authorities Took Measures to Maintain It——</p>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: Since the Xin Chang and Tong He Yu silver shops went bankrupt one after another in Bianyuan last year, a tight turnover situation has been presented. This year, the Fuli, Zheng Chang, and Hong Feng shops have also closed down one after another, causing the citizens to feel uneasy again. The pain of the paper money issued by the Yuquan Official Silver Shop, the Henan Provincial Bank, and the Northwest Bank since the Republic of China being equal to waste paper has long given the general public a bad impression. However, the Henan Provincial Agricultural and Industrial Bank suddenly experienced a run on the bank on the 4th and 5th (yesterday and today). The following is a record of what happened:</p>
<p>The Henan Provincial Agricultural and Industrial Bank is a provincial bank in nature and is the economic center of the entire Henan Province. It has issued a large number of banknotes in various denominations, including 10 cents, 20 cents, 50 cents, 1 yuan, 5 yuan, and 10 yuan, which are commonly used throughout Henan Province. According to the official announcement, the cash reserve checked by the supervisor this month was more than 1.1 million yuan, the security reserve was more than 660,000 yuan, plus a fund of more than 1 million yuan, which was more than sufficient to pay for the exchange of banknotes. However, Li Hanzhen, the general manager of the bank, recently resigned from his concurrent position as general manager of the Jiaozuo and Zhongfu Companies Joint Office and went to Zhangde and other places in northern Henan on the 1st to inspect the bank's affairs. Those who did not know the inside story mistakenly thought that he had resigned and left Bianjing, which led to rumors that triggered the psychology of the masses who had suffered losses repeatedly. Since the afternoon of the 4th, they have been holding their banknotes to the bank in Shanhudidian Street to cash them in. Although a lot of personnel were dispatched and the cash payment was stepped up and the business hours were extended to 8 pm, it was difficult to reverse the situation of the crowd and the run on the bank. In addition, the money changers and small merchants in the city wanted to profit from it, using language to scare and buy at low prices, and the whole city fell into chaos. The market price of each yuan of Agricultural and Industrial Bank paper money went from 8,300 copper coins, to 8,000, to 7,500, to 7,000. In the back streets, some even only exchanged 4,800. In addition to dispatching military police to maintain order, the authorities decided to use political power to maintain order and economic power to maintain credit. The Central, China, Transportation, and Jincheng branches in Bianjing gathered at 9 pm to discuss the issue. Each bank, money shop, and silver firm will separately exchange Agricultural and Industrial Bank exchange coupons. The joint conference of the Chamber of Commerce also decided to maintain it uniformly. This morning, each back street money stall used the copper coins exchanged from last night to pay, and after 8 o'clock, each commercial shop in the city posted "Welcome Agricultural and Industrial Bank banknotes," and the exchange silver dollar offices all posted slogans "This shop exchanges Henan Agricultural and Industrial Bank exchange coupons". Liu Zhi and Zhang Jingping jointly issued announcements, and the bank's announcements were pasted all over the streets. Military police were standing inside and outside the bank to maintain order, and very few people went to exchange money, and the storm gradually eased. (5th)</p>
<p>Songjiang: A Construction Bureau Automobile Ran Over an Old Woman</p>
<p>Since the opening of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, automobiles have been travelling frequently between Shanghai and Hangzhou. Yesterday (9th), an automobile of the Shanghai Construction Bureau passed through Jinshan Street, and an old woman, surnamed Qin, failed to avoid it. The automobile of the bureau drove past rapidly, and the old woman Qin was tragically run over and killed. The local sub-precinct police officer took charge of guarding the area, and reported to the county court to send a prosecutor to investigate the scene.</p>
<p>The Education Department Sent Personnel to Investigate the Case in Songjiang</p>
<p>Yu Xiufeng, sent by the Education Department, arrived in Songjiang the day before yesterday. It is heard that he is responsible for investigating the county's educational administrative affairs. He has been investigating in all directions for days, and is very meticulous. Now that the official business has been completed, he returned to the province yesterday to report on his mission.</p>
<p>Suzhou: Five People Injured in a Teapot Explosion</p>
<p>Zhao Bangxiang, the owner of Tian Heng Xiang Copper and Tin Shop, No. 110, Dongzhong Market, Qunmen, was 61 years old and from Zhenjiang. He passed away at 3:00 pm the day before yesterday (9th). His son, Deyun, hired a monk to chant sutras and burned tin ingots in a small copper basin. Until yesterday morning (10th), five people, Yuan Tong An nun Gu Yuandao, Huayue, Xinlian, Tongfa, and Yongfu An old nun Dagen and others, changed Tao Hua Bridge Yao to chant sutras. At 11:00 am, an object suddenly exploded with a loud bang in the copper basin in which the paper ingots were burned, and sparks splashed everywhere. At that time, Deyun's four-year-old son, Jin'er, was kneeling and paying respects to the deceased, and was injured in his left arm. A 16-year-old apprentice in the shop, Jin Gen, was next to him, and his left hand and lower jaw were injured. A partner also injured his shoulder, but the injuries were minor. The most pitiful ones were the old nun Dagen (58 years old) and the young nun Tongfa (12 years old), whose waists, buttocks, and thighs were injured, and their injuries were quite serious. The injured people were sent to Chide Hospital for treatment by car.</p>
<p>Private Counterfeit Currency Organization Busted</p>
<p>The Public Security Bureau's Detective Team received a confidential report on the 9th that a counterfeit currency organization was located at a certain address in Hengjie, Wuxian County. They immediately secretly dispatched detectives Fan Guangrong and Wang Xuexiang to search the area at night. They seized scattered machines such as printing presses, and 270 Shanghai China Bank double-corner banknotes that had been printed but not yet completed. They also captured criminals Hua Genpei and Chen Changlin. After leading the team, they confessed that there were manufacturing machines hidden in the Weixiaoxuan Candy Shop at the Nanxin Bridge in Jinmenkou. At midnight, they led the two criminals to the scene for investigation and seizure. All the manufacturing machines were confiscated, and a shop partner, Xu, was arrested together and taken back for interrogation.</p>
<p>Wuxi: Abbot of Zhifu Temple Commits Suicide by Hanging</p>
<p>Near Xue Sin'iang Bridge, near the south end of Nanyan City in the 8th District, there is a Zhifu Temple, co-managed by monks Yifan and Zhuxian. In normal times, the incense is very prosperous. The day before yesterday was the 30th day of the seventh lunar month, known as the birthday of the Earth Treasury, and the foolish people in the vicinity all went to chant sutras and worship Buddha, all night long. Who knew that on this day, Zhuxian suddenly hanged himself on the mezzanine of his house, kneeling with his knees on the ground. By the time he was discovered, he had already died. It is heard that the monk was only 24 years old, from the Yaojia Li family in Xialianqing. His mother is still alive, and he has four brothers. He was sent to the temple when he was young because of poverty. The reason for his suicide is unknown.</p>
<p>The Entire Educational Community Strives for Educational Funds</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Education Department ordered each county to reduce the allocation of educational funds by 60% starting this year, because the drought this year has been very severe and the income of educational funds will be affected. After receiving the order, the Wuxi County Government submitted it for discussion at the County Administrative Conference, which aroused controversy from all sides. No final decision has been made. Since the establishment of the County Treasury in this county, the teachers' salaries cannot be paid on time, which affects the county's education. A meeting of district directors was convened yesterday to decide the following: (1) Regarding the issue of reducing and discounting the payment of educational funds, the County Association and the District Associations will jointly submit a petition to the Education Department, detailing the historical background and the current situation, and the educational funds for this county should be paid in full. (2) The County Treasury has not paid the educational funds for the various schools in August, and it will be even more difficult to grasp them in the future. The Association will submit a petition to the County Government Education Bureau, requesting that the arrears for August be paid off by the 15th of this month, and that the funds for each item must be paid in full by the 15th of each month. If the goal is not achieved, we can only convene the district directors to gather at the county bureau to petition.</p>
<p>Chambers of Commerce in Various Counties are Allowed to be Preserved</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the existence or abolition of the Chamber of Commerce, the previous Jiangsu Provincial Chamber of Commerce Joint Conference held in Wujiang once discussed it and recommended the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce Joint Committee, Yu Xiaochuan, to explain the process to the Provincial Security Department and request instructions. The day before yesterday afternoon, the chambers of commerce of various counties in southern Jiangsu continued to hold a meeting at the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce in Suzhou. More than one hundred representatives from Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Changshu, Wuxi, Wujin, Jiangyin, Yixing, and other counties attended. The following was resolved: (1) Regarding the organization of the Chamber of Commerce, Chairman Chen has approved it. Before the establishment of the Baojia system, it is allowed to exist. Now that the drought in various counties in southern Jiangsu is very severe, the existing Chamber of Commerce should be effectively reorganized. (2) Employed group members are to be dismissed in accordance with the order. (3) The relationship between the Chamber of Commerce and local security should be reported to the provincial government by the county magistrates of each county, so that the past process can be clarified.</p>
<p>Changshu: Locusts Found in the Northwest Countryside</p>
<p>Since the beginning of summer this year, the severe drought has caused disasters, and 50% to 60% of the fields have not been transplanted with rice seedlings. Since the beginning of autumn, it has been extremely hot. Although it rained once last month, it was of no help. Fortunately, the fields along the pond were unharmed thanks to manual irrigation. Now that the county government is about to determine the autumn harvest, farmers fear that the authorities will not understand the situation and only report the condition of the fields along the pond, so they have reported the disaster situation to the various district offices. Recently, it was learned that a large number of locusts suddenly flew into the various villages in Xixushi, the fourth district, in the twilight the night before last. They came from the northeast and were numerous, covering the mountains and fields. The villagers burned incense and lit candles, and knelt down to worship. Then a part of them flew to Wang Village. Now, in addition to reporting to the county government, the district office has ordered the villagers to try their best to capture them.</p>
<p>Provincial Committee Secretly Investigates the Case of the Public Security Bureau Chief Being Accused</p>
<p>Yang Jiashu, the chief of the Meili Public Security Bureau, because he captured a local smuggler, Wang Zhicheng, also found certificates, bronze seals, guns and ammunition and all anti-animal objects in his home. Subsequently, after someone interceded, Wang Zhicheng was only presented as an ordinary smoking criminal. The head office also ordered him to be released. Later, after the people presented a provincial accusation, the head office suspended Director Yang's duties for safekeeping. However, the citizens in the countryside, because this case is of great importance, and the director of the head office, Zhou Ding, had heard about it beforehand, it is undoubtedly suspicious, and they have petitioned the province to request an investigation. After receiving the petition, the provincial government sent personnel to Changshu yesterday to secretly investigate in various places. Because their actions are extremely secretive, the content cannot be known.</p>
<p>Nantong: Joint Sale of Cotton from Three Counties in Shazhou</p>
<p>Shazhou, which is jointly administered by Nantong, Jiangyin, and Changshu counties, has a very rich cotton production. The Department of Finance sent Commissioner Zhu Yuwu to Shazhou to meet with Qian Ruchang and others, the cooperative instructors from the three counties, to discuss joint sales plans. It was decided that the weighing scale would open on the 14th.</p>
<p>Tangshan Agricultural Education Center Moved to Tongzhou</p>
<p>The Tangshan Jiangsu Provincial Farmers' Education Center was ordered to move to Nantong and renamed the Nantong Provincial People's Education Center. Wu Jianzhen, a section chief of the Education Department, and the center's director, Xi Fang, came to Tongzhou and inspected the East Park as the center's site.</p>
<p>The Press Celebrates Journalists' Day in Retrospect</p>
<p>The press in Tongyi celebrated Journalists' Day in retrospect on the 9th at the East Public Association. The meeting opened at 8:00 am and Sun Zizai and others were appointed as the presidium. The situation was extremely enthusiastic. There was a gathering for lunch. All local newspapers were closed for one day on the 10th.</p>
<p>Jiangyin: Department of Construction Orders County to Prohibit the Capture of Fish Fry</p>
<p>The head of the Provincial Fisheries Experiment Station stated that shad and knife fish are special products of the Yangtze River, and fishermen in Jiangyin and Jingjiang counties rely on them as a major source of income. However, in recent years, due to the ignorance of fishermen, they have been indiscriminately catching fish fry, resulting in a decreasing output. The spawning period for shad and knife fish is from February to May each year along the Yangtze River, and the eggs hatch into fish fry in July and August. The fishermen along the river always indiscriminately catch them with fine nets, leaving nothing behind the nets. After the fishermen catch them, they dry and sell them, but the taste is not good and the price is low. The annual catch is about 1,000 loads. Each fish fry weighs about one qian, and it can grow to one jin in two years. Counting by one thousand loads, 160,000 loads should be lost each year, worth about 2 million yuan. In other counties such as Nantong and Changshu, it is inevitable that there is such indiscriminate catching. If they are added together, the losses will be even more alarming. The head of the station specifically requested the Department of Construction to order the county magistrates of Jiang and Jing to strictly prohibit it.</p>
<p>Jiashan: Bandits Rob a Farmer's Home at the North Ring Bridge</p>
<p>Jin Huisheng, a farmer from Shaoxing, planted more than 60 mu of paddy fields at the North Ring Bridge in Gan Yao Town. His family is well-off. The day before yesterday, Huisheng went to town to buy brown rice and got 40 silver dollars. When he returned home as usual, several bandits broke into the house, twisted Jin and beat him hard, forcing him to say where he hid the money. Huisheng could not bear the pain of torture, so he told them about the money for buying rice and the original gold jewelry, etc., which were taken away to their satisfaction. In total, he lost more than fifty silver dollars.</p>
<p>Gaoyou: Bandits Occupy Tangjiabao</p>
<p>A large number of bandits have been operating in the northeast countryside of this county recently. Fearing that the army will come to suppress them, they are now breaking into smaller groups, with each group of about ten people, kidnapping in all directions. The people in the villages that have been kidnapped have fled to other places, and nine out of ten houses are empty. Tangjiabao and Daliaozai and other places near Linze are now occupied by bandits, cutting off transportation, and the situation is huge. The people in the area are terrified. The Provincial Security Team stationed in Wangying has now sent a team to Zhen Linze to act according to the opportunity to suppress them.</p>
<p>Jiaxing: Store Residents Campaign to Reduce Rent</p>
<p>Jiaxing is suffering from a severe drought, business is sluggish, and unemployment has doubled. Store residents are all feeling difficult. They are now planning to request that the rent be changed to 70% of the original payment in order to provide relief. The method is from September of this year to August of next year,</p>

<p>I</p>
<p>A public banquet was held by various groups for the Belgian Special Envoy, Baron Moncheur. The hosting organizations were the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce (Yu Zuoting, Chen Zheqing), the Chinese National Federation of Industries (Guo Shun, Hu Xiyuan), the International Problems Research Association (Liu Zhanen, Li Zhaohuan), the Bankers Association (Zhang Gongquan, Bei Songsun), and the Trade Association (Guo Bingwen, Lin Kanghou). Guests included the Belgian Special Envoy Baron Moncheur, members of his delegation (M. Yturralde, M. Monteyne, M. Anteunis), the Belgian Minister to China (J. Guillaume), the Consul-General (M. Tellefsen), the Vice-Consuls (M. Huboi, M. Delcoigne), the Mayor of Shanghai (Wu Tiecheng), the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government (Tang Shixuan, Li Mo), the Section Chief of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Zhao Tiejiang), the President of the Belgian Chamber of Commerce (M. Haelen), the General Manager of the Banque Belge pour l'Étranger (M. Smits), the Manager (M. Lafond), and more than forty others, including Lin Tongshi, Wang Yanxi, and Xie Fusheng.</p>
<p>Welcome Speech</p>
<p>During the banquet, the Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Yu Zuoting, delivered the following welcome speech: "Special Envoy Baron Moncheur, bearing the mission of reciprocal visit, has come to China. Since entering the capital and completing the audience with the head of state, he has traveled extensively and visited famous sites in the former capital. Recently, he has returned south from his travels and graced Shanghai with his presence. Our Chamber, as the local host, has prepared a humble feast to welcome the envoy and to express our long-cherished admiration. We are honored by your presence, which makes this gathering even more special. Your country and our country established commercial relations in 1865, which corresponds to the fourth year of the Tongzhi reign in our country. This history is now sixty-nine years old. Although our countries are geographically distant, and few of our citizens engage in commercial activities in your country beyond studying or traveling, your country has left a historically valuable impression on our domestic industrial circles. The earliest railways built in our country, the Guannei Railway (now the Beining Railway) and the Luhan Railway (now the Pinghan Railway), owe much to your country. The latter, which traverses central and northern China, is even more important in terms of transportation than the Guannei Railway. When this railway was initially built, the source of funding and the technical personnel were all borrowed and hired from your country, enabling the completion of this historically significant transportation project in China. We cannot help but express our gratitude for your country's assistance. Furthermore, we have heard that the envoy's visit is associated with an especially memorable story. It is said that the Yellow River Railway Bridge on the Pinghan Railway was designed and built by the envoy's esteemed father when he served as an engineer on that railway. As a Chinese saying goes, 'incense and fire predestined connection.' The envoy's visit to China adds another layer to this relationship, truly demonstrating a profound connection. We also received a letter from our envoy to your country, mentioning that the Special Envoy is also a banker and industrialist, which further enhances the cordial feelings between host and guests at today's gathering. In addition to railways, the Hanyang Iron and Steel Works, the only factory in our country at the time capable of producing steel rails for railways, also employed dozens of engineers and technicians from your country during its initial years of operation. Therefore, although the history of commercial relations between your country and our country may not be as long as that of other countries, it is deeply related to the future of our country's industrial development. This is a source of pride in the history of diplomatic relations between our two countries. Recalling our country's admiration for your country at that time, and our desire to seek your country's assistance in industrial technology, was not only because your country's steel industry was world-renowned, but also because your country, since the Treaty of London in 1831, has been a symbol of world peace, while simultaneously possessing the qualities of determination and decisiveness, respecting the sovereignty of other nations while protecting its own. This aligns perfectly with our country's traditional values, resulting in a seamless spiritual connection and enabling the preservation of valuable memories in our seventy-year diplomatic history. Our association firmly believes that this spirit will continue indefinitely. We wish the Special Envoy good health and a pleasant journey." The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Banking Association, the Chinese National Federation of Industries, the International Trade Association, and the International Problems Research Association were among the hosts. In response, the Belgian Special Envoy stated, "In my short half-month in your country, I have already witnessed the grandeur of your nation and a glimpse of its great future. Seeing the frugality and hard work of your farmers, I cannot help but feel confident in China's future. As China's industry and commerce flourish, the responsibilities of bankers in national development will undoubtedly be significant." The banquet ended around one o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Belgian Envoy's Tea Party</p>
<p>The Belgian Minister to China, Mr. Guillaume and his wife, held a grand tea party at the Belgian legation's garden on Route Lafayette yesterday afternoon at 5 p.m., to welcome Special Envoy Johnson and his entire delegation.

The Belgian Minister and his wife warmly received the guests with champagne and refreshments. The guests and hosts joyfully dispersed around 7 p.m.</p>
<p>Departure from Shanghai This Morning</p>
<p>Yesterday evening at 8:30 p.m., Mayor Wu hosted a banquet at the Cathay Hotel on the Bund to welcome Special Envoy Johnson and his delegation. The Belgian Minister and his wife, the Belgian Consul-General Mr. Tellefsen and his wife, the Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Mr. Yu Zuoting, secretaries and directors of the municipal government, and representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also attended. The banquet concluded around 10 p.m. According to municipal government sources, Special Envoy Johnson is scheduled to depart for his home country on the Italian liner Conte Rosso this morning. The Special Envoy originally planned to board the ship last night, but decided to postpone his departure until 8:30 a.m. this morning due to sufficient time. He will board the Italian liner from the Jianghai Customs Wharf via the customs patrol boat Jinghui. Mayor Wu will personally see him off at that time and has decided to send the Public Security Bureau's military band and honor guards from the Security Department to the Pudong wharf to bid farewell.</p>

<p>Postal Office to Sell</p>
<p>New Stamp Tax Stamps with Pagoda Design</p>
<p>To be Implemented on November 1st, According to a Proclamation from the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>The Review Committee of Revenue Collection Agencies to be Terminated in October</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has issued a proclamation stating: "The stamp tax is collected on documents and should be based on the principle of actual affixation. All documents subject to stamp tax under the Provisional Regulations on Stamp Tax, except for those of a permanent nature, have a certain period of validity. If merchants and the public can affix stamps as required, the stamps they obtain will be affixed and cancelled on the documents in a timely manner, and the validity of the stamps will expire accordingly. However, in recent years, while many merchants and the public have complied with the regulations, there have also been many who have indulged in bad habits, preferring to pay a fixed amount and not paying attention to actual affixation. Furthermore, revenue collection agencies have sought to simplify matters, indulging in leniency and failing to strictly enforce the regulations. As a result, there has been a backlog of un-affixed stamps in the hands of merchants and the public, which has led to a decline in national tax revenue and, on the merchants' side, often resulted in violations and penalties during strict inspections. This situation, where both the government and the public are in difficulty, calls for urgent remedy. It is hereby stipulated that all provincial stamp tax collection agencies and review committees for cases of violation of stamp tax regulations shall be terminated uniformly by the end of October this year. From November 1st, the Ministry will produce and print new stamp tax stamps with a pagoda design, and entrust them to provincial post offices for sale, so that the public can freely purchase and affix them. In the future, except for the locations designated by the post office for sale, no other agencies or businesses will be allowed to sell them. The responsibility for inspection will be entrusted to the provincial, municipal, and county governments, with personnel from the provincial stamp tax and tobacco and alcohol tax bureaus conducting random inspections. The Ministry will send personnel to supervise the process. Cases of violation of stamp tax laws and regulations will be referred to local judicial organs for handling. The existing old stamp tax stamps can still be used as usual before the end of October. From November 1st, the date the post office begins selling stamps, all documents created must not be affixed with these old stamps, otherwise they will be penalized as if they were not affixed. It should be known that the Ministry is reforming the issuance, inspection, and penalty of stamp tax stamps. The various accumulated malpractices of the past can be cleared up from now on, and merchants and the public will benefit significantly. Furthermore, the revenue from the stamp tax has been designated by the Ministry to be used largely to supplement the reduction of agricultural surtaxes in various provinces. That is, the central government collects more regular tax, and the local government receives more subsidies, which can reduce the surtax by one more share and provide the people with one more share of real benefit. The relationship is even more important. It is hoped that merchants and the public will understand this intention and, from November 1st, purchase stamp tax stamps from the post office and affix them as required for all documents subject to stamp tax. Do not continue to conceal and omit them as before, lest you incur penalties. This proclamation is issued for general knowledge, in addition to submitting it to the relevant departments for implementation. This proclamation is issued on the [blank] day of September in the 23rd year of the Republic of China, by Minister Kong Xiangxi."</p>

<p>Ministry of Finance Restricts Foreign Exchange and Cracks Down on Speculation</p>
<p>Gold and Goods Auctions Suspended Simultaneously Yesterday</p>
<p>The gold market price is standardized according to the London gold bullion price.</p>
<p>It was agreed that swap transactions would be implemented next month, and the market would open today.</p>
<p>The black market rose 15 yuan, resulting in a loss of 30 million yuan.</p>
<p>The Foreign Exchange Committee of the Bank held discussions yesterday.</p>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, the Ministry of Finance issued an order the night before last, restricting foreign exchange trading and cracking down on gold speculation. This had a significant impact on banks dealing with foreign exchange and gold exchanges. Yesterday morning, all banks, the Foreign Exchange Committee, and the board of directors of the Gold Exchange held emergency meetings. The Gold Exchange and the Goods Exchange suspended trading for one day. The chairman of the board of directors and the supervisor, Chen Hang, agreed on the standard for gold trading prices, using the Central Bank's London gold bullion price as the benchmark. Subsequently, at the request of the brokerage community, the new standard was postponed to October 15th, when the December contracts roll over. Trading will resume as usual today. Yesterday, the gold black market rose by 15 yuan compared to last Saturday. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Bank Foreign Exchange Committee Discusses</p>
<p>After receiving the order from the Ministry of Finance, the Bankers Association held a meeting of the Foreign Exchange Committee at 11 a.m. yesterday. Twelve people attended, including Bei Songsun from the Bank of China and Shen Laiqing from the Continental Bank. After detailed discussion, it was reported that their opinions were contributed to the Ministry of Finance, but the content was difficult to disclose. According to one banker, the order from the Ministry of Finance limits foreign exchange trading to three types. However, except for the second item with a clear time frame, the remaining (1 and 3) items, referring to legitimate and normal business and private needs, lack a clear standard, causing those dealing in foreign exchange to be at a loss and forced to stop operations or trade without any transactions. However, foreign banks may not comply with the order, and as a result, it may be a futile attempt to drive away sparrows with scarecrows.</p>
<p>Two Exchanges Suspend Trading for One Day</p>
<p>The Gold Exchange received the order from the Ministry of Finance yesterday through supervisor Chen Hang, prohibiting settlement in foreign exchange and requiring all transactions to be settled in cash. This caused panic among brokers. The chairman of the Brokerage Association, Wang Jiafu, and others requested the chairman of the board of directors, Xu Busun, to temporarily suspend trading for one day. The notice from the board of directors is as follows: "(1) The Shanghai newspapers today contain the order from the Ministry of Finance regarding the exchange. The chairman of the board of directors has already gone to the supervisor's office to seek instructions on how to proceed and should temporarily suspend trading. (2) An emergency meeting will be held at the Gold Trade Association on North Wuxi Road at 2 p.m. today. Please ensure that all brokers are present. (3) Due to the order from the Ministry of Finance, an emergency meeting will be held in the afternoon, allowing trading to be temporarily suspended for one day according to the agreement between the brokers and the association. A further notice will be issued after a decision is made at the meeting." Trading in goods and gold was suspended simultaneously.</p>
<p>Board of Directors Agrees on New Standard</p>
<p>The Gold Exchange held a meeting of the board of directors yesterday morning. Eleven people attended, including Xu Busun, Miao Jinzhi, Cai Jiusheng, Zhao Zhongying, and Wang Zhixiang. The meeting was chaired by Xu Busun, chairman of the board of directors. The following resolutions were made: "(1) Accept the order from the Ministry of Finance prohibiting settlement in foreign exchange. (2) The gold market price has always been standardized according to the US dollar exchange rate. The Ministry of Finance's order does not specify the new standard. After consultation between the chairman of the board of directors and supervisor Chen Jian'an, it was decided to use the Central Bank's daily London gold bullion price as the standard."</p>
<p>Brokers' Association Requests Postponement</p>
<p>At 2 p.m. yesterday, all brokers held a general meeting at the Gold Trade Association on North Wuxi Road, chaired by Deputy Chairman Wang Jiafu, to discuss measures. "(1) Whether to approve the new standard for settlement set by the board of directors." It was resolved that the new standard was difficult to approve. Zhan Liansheng from Hengfengyong Gold Company and Wang Jiafu from Yuanmaoyong Gold Company were elected to negotiate with Chairman Xu Busun. All transactions will temporarily follow the old rules until December this year, and a proper solution will be negotiated. "(2) According to the reports of the two representatives, Chairman Xu Busun was consulted about the new standard, and it was impossible to change it. As for the swap contracts, it may be possible to negotiate a proper solution due to the limited time, or extend it to September 20th or the end of the month." It was resolved that the September 15th October rollover would still follow the old standard, while the October 15th December contracts rollover would all use the new standard. Zhan Liansheng and Wang Jiafu were still nominated to negotiate with the chairman. The two representatives went to see Xu Busun, who then consulted with Supervisor Chen Hang. Only at 4:45 p.m. did Zhan and Wang return to the meeting and report that they had obtained the supervisor's consent. The meeting was then adjourned. Trading will resume as usual this morning. The Exchange has sparked much discussion.</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the Gold Exchange announced a temporary suspension of trading, those who made a living by spreading rumors and scalping went to the exchange to watch and discuss. They said that they would have no place to stand if they could not buy and sell short in the future, because those who made a living by spreading rumors were experienced and had sharp eyes. What they did was foreign exchange. For example, if they bought gold pounds on one side, they would immediately calculate the selling price of francs on the other side. They would make a long position in whichever direction they could profit. If they could not trade in foreign exchange, they would have no way to spread rumors. As for scalping, they watched the market trend and followed the big players to earn small profits. In the future, cracking down on speculation will stabilize the gold price somewhat, and this group of people will have no profit to make.</p>
<p>Gold Black Market Rises 15 Yuan</p>
<p>Although the gold market was closed yesterday, a few firms were still trading. Because there were more short positions in the market, and now that cash trading is required, the short positions are bound to be covered, so the market price soared. The highest price was 965 yuan, and it was said that 77 bars were traded. The smallest price was 58 yuan, and 49 bars were traded. More trades were done at 60 yuan. The last price was around 60 yuan, which was about 15 yuan higher than last Saturday's closing price (949.5 yuan). Due to the gold market's suspension of trading, Chinese merchants poured more than 200,000 pounds of gold into the pound market and more than 1 million US dollars into the US dollar market. The market was extremely chaotic because people were terrified.</p>
<p>Controlling Exchange Rates is Impractical</p>
<p>According to those engaged in international trade, China has always had to bear the responsibility for fluctuations in foreign exchange in addition to the responsibility for price fluctuations of goods in foreign trade. Now, if speculation in gold is prohibited, the price of gold will be more stable, which will reduce the risk for those engaged in international trade. However, because China has extraterritoriality, it can only prohibit Chinese merchants from speculation, but it cannot prohibit foreign merchants from speculation. As a result, gold speculation will be transferred from the hands of Chinese merchants to the hands of foreign merchants, which is actually not helpful to the policy of controlling international exchange rates.</p>
<p>Losses of 30 Million Yuan in One Day</p>
<p>It is also said that because China is a net importer in trade, it is often short in the gold market. Now, it is necessary to trade in cash, so the short positions are bound to be covered, and the gold price is bound to rise further. Taking yesterday's (10th) black market as an example, the total loss to our country in international exchange rates has already exceeded 30 million yuan.</p>
<p>Special Survey Record of Domestic Goods and Industries</p>
<p>(4) Enamel Industry (i.e., Porcelain Enamel Industry)</p>
<p>Enamel is also one of the emerging industries. During the 3rd and 4th years of the Republic of China, enamelware imports exceeded 4 million yuan annually, with Japanese goods accounting for 80%. In the 5th year of the Republic of China, a British businessman named Mr. Macleod established a large factory in Gujiawan, Zhabei, specializing in the production of enamel cups, lunch boxes, and other items. This was the beginning of the enamel industry in Shanghai. Later, Macleod failed to manage the business well and sold it to a Chinese businessman, who reorganized it into the Zhufeng Porcelain Enamel Company. Soon after, the Zhonghua Vocational School opened an enamel department in Lujiabang, with an attached Zhonghua Enamel Factory to provide students with practical training in replicating various utensils. Its reputation rose sharply, and it was subsequently reorganized into a joint-stock company, operating independently and producing its own enamel powder, without the need to rely on imports. As a result, enamel factories were established one after another, with a total of about fourteen or fifteen, with a total capital of 1.17 million yuan, a total of 74 furnaces, and an annual turnover of about 4-5 million yuan. It cannot be said that it does not occupy an important position in the domestic goods industry. Therefore, we visited Mr. Fang Jiange, manager of the Zhonghua Enamel Factory, and Mr. Jin Songtang, a standing committee member of the industry association, to learn about the general situation. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>The equipment of this industry is complete, and the more scaled manufacturers are Huafeng, Yifeng, Zhonghua Enamel, Jiuxin, and Zhufeng. The existing trade association includes Huafeng, Yifeng, Zhonghua Enamel, Shanghai, Zhufeng, Jiuxin, Xiefeng, and Weiwei. Jiuxin and Shanghai were established in the recent three years. Other manufacturers that have not joined the association are constantly changing. Some have capital of only a few thousand yuan. Last year's turnover was about 4 million yuan, with the Zhonghua factory accounting for more than one-sixth. The production order is divided into five steps: (1) blank making; (2) powder making; (3) blank washing; (4) enameling; (5) art. There are many types of enameled ware, roughly divided into basins, pots, bowls, buckets, shop signs, food baskets, wind stoves, and spittoons. At present, it has become a habit for Chinese people to use domestic goods, so there are very few sales of foreign goods. Last year, enamelware imports within 36 centimeters were less than 100,000 taels, which is gratifying. However, imports of enamelware larger than 36 centimeters still reached hundreds of thousands of taels, which is regrettable. Recently, Japanese enamelware has flooded North China and Southeast Asia, but it has disappeared along the Yangtze River. However, competition among peers is fierce, with price cuts and frequent discounts, which has not happened in ten years. It is heartbreaking to kill each other. If this is not changed, it is feared that it will create opportunities for foreign goods, which is even more frustrating. All raw materials, except for iron sheets that must be imported from the United States, can be produced by various factories. As for the difficulties in the work, it is nothing more than the workers' lack of knowledge, weak skills, and difficulty in producing exquisite products. The working efficiency is not easy to compete with foreigners. In terms of production and sales, Mr. Jin said that there are too few state-run ships (almost none in Southeast Asia), high freight rates, and few railways. Transportation takes time, and it always feels that it cannot be fully developed. Mr. Jin said that except for those who have not joined the association, the factories that have joined the association can maintain their original status and seek development. There is no factory that has failed, but due to insufficient capital, unsound organization, and lack of talent, it always feels difficult to be optimistic. The trend of this industry in the future is to reduce costs, seek outlets widely, and achieve the goal of universal sales. If the factories in the same industry can break the suicidal policy, work together, strive for excellence in technology, avoid unnecessary competition, and avoid arbitrary price cuts, they will be able to drive away foreign goods and make imports disappear. This year, due to the price cuts, the turnover of the same industry in seven months is about 2.5 million yuan, but it is difficult to cope with and difficult to profit. All the colleagues in this factory have only one goal in mind: to strive for perfection in the products and to reduce costs as much as possible, and to make the organization sound and the equipment perfect, so that the future of domestic goods can be developed. Mr. Fang and others have been enthusiastic about promoting domestic goods for decades, studying and investigating tirelessly, and attending exhibitions everywhere. They have also been dedicated to uniting the industry and fighting against foreign countries, which is respectable.</p>

<p>Nuremberg – Today, the German leader Hitler addressed the Women's Congress of the National Socialist Movement. His main theme was "The program of the women's movement has only one thing: children." Hitler continued to declare to 25,000 women, "We have already entrusted an important part to women in the struggle, that is, to create a unified nation. The women's movement is not because men are their husbands and must be resisted, but it is a part of the common struggle, and must work with their husbands to move forward with one heart and one mind. All previous women's liberation and promotion of women's knowledge and other movements, their programs have been countless. However, our program today has only one point: children. These small lives must be brought into the world, must be taught and raised. It is the most important task in life, otherwise, how can we pass on what we have fought for to future generations? Why should we fight again?" (National Telegram, 9th)</p>

<p>Barcelona, Spain</p>
<p>A Major Disturbance in Court</p>
<p>Barcelona - A few days ago, when the court here was trying Catalan separatist writer Boffil, the defendant's lawyer, Nationalist Party member Chaimas, was charged with resisting a judge's order. Today, the court sentenced Chaimas to one month in prison or a fine of one thousand pesetas. At the time of the sentencing, there was fierce resistance from the audience, resulting in a conflict. When the court president signed the judgment, someone threw an ink bottle at him. Others knocked on the court windows, scattering glass shards all over the floor. Some people even removed the Spanish flag from the preliminary judge's car, stained it with mud, and shouted, "Down with the Spanish judicial system!" and "Down with the royalist judges!" As for the defendant Chaimas and Boffil, who appeared as a witness, they escaped without a trace during the chaos. Prosecutor Sancho had requested that Chaimas be sentenced to two months in prison, and was almost beaten as a result. Afterwards, the prosecutor believed that the police's guarantee of security was inadequate and lodged a fierce protest with the police officer maintaining order. The police officer arrested him on the grounds of "insulting the Catalan Autonomous Province police affairs." The Prosecutor General's request for temporary release was also rejected. The Prosecutor General then filed a complaint against the illegal arrest, insulting judicial authority, and violent acts against the court. Some people believe that the fact that Catalan provincial judges are appointed by Spaniards is enough to cause conflict, and today's incident is only the beginning. (Havas Telegram, 9th)</p>

<p>– September 10th, Reuters Special Commercial News –</p>
<p>Gold and Silver: London Gold Price: This morning's gold price was 140 shillings and 11.5 pence, 2.5 pence higher than Saturday's price.</p>
<p>London Silver: In today's silver market, purchases by the United States, India, and speculators were not enough to offset sales by China, so the price fell slightly. The spot price is 21 pence and 8125, and the futures price is 21 pence and 875, both down 0625. The market is stable.</p>
<p>Bombay Silver: Today's silver market is stable. The spot price is 60 rupees and 8 annas, the October price is 60 rupees and 9 annas, and the November price is 60 rupees and 11 annas, all up 3 annas.</p>
<p>Exchange Rates:</p>
<p>British-American: In the London foreign exchange market, the British-American exchange rate opened at 5.00125 yuan, down 125 from Saturday's closing price. At noon, it fell 5625 to 4.995625 yuan. The market then became quiet, and finally rose 375 to 4.999375 yuan. Also, one US dollar equals 4 shillings and 007 British gold.</p>
<p>British-French: This morning's opening price was 74 francs and 90, 3 pounds higher than Saturday's closing price. At 11:00, it fell 6 pounds to 74 francs and 84. The market then became sluggish until 2:00 p.m., when it began to change, rebounding 6 pounds to 74 francs and 90, the same as the opening price.</p>
<p>American-British: The New York foreign exchange market was quiet this morning. The American-British exchange rate opened at 4.99625 yuan, down 615. At 10:30, the price rebounded 125 to 4.99575 yuan.</p>
<p>Cotton and Wheat:</p>
<p>American Cotton: The US Department of Agriculture's cotton production report was favorable to the short side, so the cotton market opened today with more sellers and the price fell by about 24 pounds. However, demand was good and absorbed the selling, and the price rebounded by 7 pounds. At 10:40, it fell another 1 pound.</p>
<p>Indian Cotton: Bombay Cotton Market: The price fell initially today due to large-scale liquidations by multiple parties and speculative selling. It then rose due to low-priced purchases by European export businesses. The April-May Balochistan cotton price was 221 rupees, up 1 rupee and 25.</p>
<p>British Cotton: Liverpool Cotton Market: Prices fell sharply due to the release of the US Department of Agriculture's cotton production report. At 1:00 p.m., the October price was 6.86, 18 pounds lower than Saturday's closing price.</p>
<p>British Wheat: Liverpool Wheat Market: The price fell this morning. At 1:00 p.m., the October price was 5 yuan and 9 pence, down 1 penny.</p>
<p>American Wheat: The wheat market opened about 275 lower, falling with other commodities. However, it is expected that the government's grain report will be favorable to the long side, so the market price strengthened before noon, rising 15 at 10:40.</p>
<p>Rubber:</p>
<p>London: This morning's market was stable. At noon, the成交 price for January was 7 pence and 6875, the same as Friday's closing price.</p>
<p>New York: The rubber market opened with the price down 56 pounds, and then fell another 5 pounds. However, futures were still stable. At 10:40, the market price had not changed.</p>
<p>Securities:</p>
<p>New York: Before the securities market opened, a favorable factor for the market was that the long positions in the securities market had already been largely liquidated. Although the market has been uncertain recently, prices have not fallen again, which is reassuring. An unfavorable factor for the market is that news of construction is still lacking. As soon as prices rise, buying interest stops immediately. When the securities market opened this morning, the market was quiet and stable. The prices of various securities fell slightly. Merchants are still waiting for developments, so the market is unlikely to change immediately. The New York securities market prices are listed below:</p>

<p>Finance</p>
<p>Gold Exchange Temporarily Suspended Yesterday</p>
<p>Business as Usual Today</p>
<p>New Transactions Based on London Gold Bullion Settlement Price</p>
<p>Unexpired Swap Transactions Settled According to Original Methods</p>
<p>The Gold Exchange suspended trading yesterday due to an order from the Ministry of Finance to crack down on speculative activities. All new transactions must be settled in cash, and foreign exchange settlements are prohibited. This sudden development caused considerable confusion in the market. The board of directors issued a brief temporary notice before the market opened and later issued the following announcement: "Due to the Ministry of Finance's order, an emergency meeting will be held this afternoon. Brokers are allowed to negotiate with the Exchange to suspend trading for one day. A further announcement will be made after the meeting's decision." According to the latest news, the Gold Trade Association has decided that new transactions will be settled based on the London gold bullion price, effective October 15th. Existing swap transactions will be settled according to the original methods. Therefore, the gold market is expected to resume business as usual today (the 11th).</p>
<p>Cash Settlement Required</p>
<p>Gold Market "Gray Market" Soars</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Cracks Down on Foreign Exchange Draft Speculation</p>
<p>U.S. Considers Banning Private Silver Imports</p>
<p>Due to the Ministry of Finance's order cracking down on gold margin foreign exchange speculation (intended to prevent the outflow of cash), all new transactions must be settled in cash. This news led the Gold Exchange to fear an unexpected price surge and decided to suspend trading for one day, pending an emergency meeting to determine the course of action. However, the "gray market" within the exchange remained relatively active, although the number of transactions was naturally small. The initial announcement of the Ministry of Finance's order to stop foreign exchange speculation, coupled with the news that new transactions must be settled in cash, greatly boosted market sentiment. Furthermore, the U.S. Treasury's intention to ban private silver imports dealt a significant blow to short sellers, causing widespread panic. However, due to the market suspension, there was no standard price. Nevertheless, the "gray market" saw transactions at 970 yuan due to the extreme tightness of the foreign exchange market. Later, HSBC quoted a reduction of 1.25 for Sterling and 0.25 for USD. After the announcement, the internal market shifted from tight to loose, with sellers appearing at 65 yuan. Mitsui offered December USD at 31.25, retreating to within 60 yuan. Generally, Western merchants showed selling interest, with transactions at 958 yuan. Afterwards, the "gray market" gradually became public, with some trading activity, struggling around the 60 yuan mark. Near noon, transactions surged slightly, with some buying hundreds of bars at 60 yuan. However, sellers were also eager, making it difficult to rise to 61 yuan, although the underlying sentiment remained firm. There were no legitimate transactions in the later market, but some small deals outside the door were priced at slightly above 60 yuan. The USD settlement price today was 992 yuan due to HSBC's quoted reduction of 0.25, which is equivalent to a margin price. Calculated based on a margin price of 960 yuan, the "button" [discount or premium] was approximately 32 yuan, 8 yuan less than last Saturday. In this urgent and changing situation, the Gold Exchange had no choice but to convene an emergency meeting at the Gold Trade Association at 2 PM. It is rumored that the new standard will be changed to Customs Gold settlement. The calculation method is to multiply Customs Gold by 508. Today, Customs Gold was quoted at 19.13, resulting in a settlement price of 977 yuan.</p>
<p>Chinese Merchants Forced to Cover Shorts</p>
<p>Sudden Tightening of Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>According to yesterday's foreign dispatches, London's large amounts increased by 0.0625 for both near and far terms, while the U.S. bank remained unchanged. London spot gold decreased by half a penny, Sterling increased by 0.0375 against the USD, the USD increased by 0.025 against Sterling, and Sterling increased by 9 pounds against the French franc, while the USD against the French franc remained unchanged. Reports stated that the Ministry of Finance ordered a crackdown on gold margin foreign exchange speculation, causing Chinese merchants to urgently cover their short positions. In addition, reports indicated that the U.S. Treasury Department intends to prohibit the import of private silver. Historically, this port's drafts have been resold by various banks from silver. If this becomes a reality, the export of silver should be undertaken by an official mechanism, and the foreign exchange market will lack large positions, which is not conducive to short positions. Therefore, the informal foreign exchange market opened this morning with a bid price of 1 shilling, 5 pence and 0.125 for Sterling and 35.5625 yuan for USD. Chinese merchants, such as Yu Qingyong, tried hard to cover their positions, but banks lacked selling interest, and brokers refused to help Chinese merchants exit. In an instant, there was an extreme tightening. December USD approached 35, and Sterling actually retreated to within 5 pence. After the HSBC listing was announced, Sterling decreased by 0.125 and USD decreased by 0.25. Banks were willing to sell, and Chinese merchants were exhausted. Consequently, the market gradually hardened, with slight swaps in Sterling. The noon close price for Sterling was 1 shilling, 4 pence and 0.875, and for USD, 35.25 yuan. Later, trading became even thinner, with Chinese merchants still covering. Bombay rose by 1.12 anna, and the domestic market loosened slightly. As transactions were already few, Bombay reported no movement. Finally, the market was mediocre. The closing price for the near-term Sterling was 1 shilling, 4 pence and 0.9375, and for the USD, 35.25 yuan. Compared to last Saturday, Sterling tightened by 0.1875 and USD tightened by 0.4375. Chinese merchants covered approximately 1.5 million USD and nearly 100,000 pounds in Sterling. The overall situation was chaotic. The day's transactions are recorded below:</p>
<p>Sterling opened this morning with a near-term bid price of 1 shilling, 5 pence and 0.125. After opening, the market tightened immediately. MacGregor covered December at 5 pence. Central sold to MacGregor September at 5 pence. MacGregor covered October at the same price. HSBC covered December at the same price. Great Britain benefited from covering December at 0.9375 and October at 0.875. Beneficial covering January at 0.0625 and selling December at 5 pence.

<p>Weekly Interbank Rate Returns to One Cent</p>
<p>The silver dollar market situation: Due to the bank holiday on the previous Sunday, there were various unresolved procedures that needed to be completed yesterday, resulting in a lively market atmosphere, which was more active than in the previous few days. The interbank lending rate was the same in both the morning and afternoon markets at one cent, which was one point higher than the previous day. The additional interest charge (劃頭加水) initially started at two points and then changed to four points, which was also a significant improvement. In terms of interbank loan transactions, the morning market saw over 4.7 million in fund transfers and new transactions, while the afternoon market saw over 200,000 in transactions. Transactions in the Small General Association totaled over 400,000. Silver pawn transactions saw redemptions of over 900,000 and new loans of over 1.4 million.

<p>Jiangnan Small Dollars and Copper Coins Rebound</p>
<p>After falling at the beginning of the month, Jiangnan small dollars remained stagnant for five or six days. Yesterday, the market saw slightly brisk trading, and prices also increased. The morning market increased by 0.50 yuan, trading at 833.50 yuan. The afternoon market continued to increase by 1.50 yuan, trading at 835 yuan.

<p>Securities</p>
<p>Public Bonds Experienced a Sudden Decline in Both Rounds</p>
<p>Resulting in Drops Ranging from 0.02, 0.03 to 1.20 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was extremely peaceful, and the environment was stable. The interbank lending rate was fixed. However, rumors suddenly spread that a certain party had sent a telegram, which was fueled by short sellers on the floor, who took the opportunity to pressure the market, causing an unnecessary decline. Afterwards, the market returned to peace. The rapid changes inevitably led to criticism of self-inflicted panic. Based on the current situation, the market should continue to fluctuate upwards, as buying interest was seen in the No. 46 issue, and selling interest in the No. 4 issue was scarce. Short sellers on the floor are about to cover their positions. Yesterday's performance: The market opened with a uniform upward trend, with most issues increasing by 0.05, 0.10 to about 0.50 yuan. However, the gains in the following issues were slightly weaker. In the second round, rumors suddenly spread, and the decline became more severe, with some issues falling by as much as 1.20 yuan. In the evening, the earlier issues caught up with the decline, with Troop Reduction falling by about 1 yuan. However, the market gradually stabilized, and the distant maturities of the Consolidated Tax issue were slightly better by 0.05. In total, the market price results showed declines ranging from 0.02, 0.03 to 1.20 yuan. The total trading volume was approximately 20 million yuan. The comparative results of the increases and decreases are listed in the table below:</p>

<p>Yarn and Cloth</p>
<p>Coarse Yarn Sales to Guangdong Are Booming</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Reaches New Low</p>
<p>The actual sales of cotton yarn are noticeably improving. Demand from the southern ports is quite robust. There is a rumor that Guangzhou will increase import duties on cotton yarn starting October 1st (whether this is true remains to be proven). Therefore, those buyers are taking precautions and buying over a thousand bales in advance. However, market sentiment remains difficult to excite. The fact that the market price has fallen by 1 yuan despite brisk yarn sales shows how deeply entrenched the market's problems are.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Japanese Mills Liquidating Distant Futures</p>
<p>At the opening of the margin yarn market, the increased U.S. cotton production figures dampened market sentiment, causing all months to reach new lows. Later, as actual yarn sales were relatively brisk, prices rose slightly in the second and third rounds. The result was a drop of 0.03, 0.04, 0.07, 0.08 yuan for all months. It was rumored that Japanese mills were liquidating distant futures. The market remained flat in the afternoon. In the second round, the market showed signs of vigor, with buyers from Guangdong and Yunnan purchasing 1,500-1,600 bales of spot yarn. Other buyers also made transactions, totaling over 2,500 bales. However, prices fell again in the distant months at the close of the market. This was because the buyers were mainly buying coarse yarn, and sales of 20-count yarn remained weak. The result was an increase of 0.02 yuan in the near months and a drop of 0.01, 0.02, 0.03 yuan in the distant months. The total trading volume for the day was 47,100 bales. Da Fu sold 1,650 bales, Tong Ji 500 bales, Heng Yi 800 bales, Yu Da 1,050 bales, Da Feng 600 bales, Hui Kang 1,550 bales, Chang Yu 500 bales, Shen Ji 2,750 bales, Ren Feng 1,000 bales, Chang Feng 1,200 bales, Geng Feng 900 bales, Yuan Yi 900 bales, Xie Sheng 550 bales, Ming De 700 bales. Shen Chang bought 2,200 bales, Jin Chang 700 bales, Da Ji 1,250 bales, Yuan Da 950 bales, Geng Feng 2,750 bales, Xie Cheng 1,100 bales, Yi Cheng 750 bales, Xie Sheng 650 bales, Chang Yu 800 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>

<p>Total		281,600</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Reach 2,500 Bales</p>
<p>Sales of spot yarn are improving, with strong demand from the south. Statistics show that buyers purchased a total of 2,521 bales throughout the day. Prices fell by 0.05 to 1 yuan. The purchase amounts by region are listed below:</p>
<p>Inland: 250 Guangdong: 1,135 Ningbo: 20 Haizhou: 10</p>
<p>Wuxiang: 35 Changsha: 35 Yunnan: 531 Shantou: 10</p>
<p>Northern Buyers: 310 Peers: 25 Jiangxi: 10 Tianjin: 150</p>
<p>Cotton Market Trend Weakening</p>
<p>The cotton market is trending downwards, and the situation is weakening daily. Although everyone predicted that the second estimate of U.S. cotton production would be reduced, the published figure actually increased by 57,000 bales, which greatly disappointed bullish investors. However, buyers are still not loosening their grip, and the price decline is not severe. Yesterday, over 3,000 bales of Yao cotton arrived, with opening prices falling by 1.20 to 1.40 yuan. If the sources of cotton continue to arrive in large quantities, the situation in the cotton market cannot be predicted.</p>
<p>Margin Cotton Falls Again by 0.02-0.03 Yuan</p>
<p>At the opening of the margin cotton market, the increased U.S. cotton production estimate disappointed bullish investors. According to private telegrams, U.S. cotton prices fell by 20-30 pounds after the USDA released its production figures. Therefore, market sentiment was already weak at the opening, with prices falling by 0.02-0.03 yuan in all months. At the same time, it was rumored that over 3,000 bales of Yao cotton had arrived, with opening prices falling sharply by 1.24 yuan. However, one speculator purchased over 7,000 dan, causing prices to rebound. The result was a fall of 0.03 yuan in October and 0.01-0.02 yuan in the distant months. The market was flat at the afternoon opening, and prices fell again at the close. The result was a fall of 0.05-0.10 yuan in all months. The total trading volume for the day was 123,900 dan. Hui Kang sold 8,400 dan, Da Feng 3,200 dan, Heng Chang 2,300 dan, Tong Fu 1,800 dan, Ming De 1,200 dan, Yuan Yi 5,700 dan, Yi Cheng 3,400 dan, Tai Chang 1,200 dan, Chang Feng 5,200 dan, Xin Cheng 2,300 dan, Yi Feng 1,200 dan, Yuan Tai 1,700 dan, Heng Chang 1,800 dan. Yu bought 1,100 dan, Yuan Da 5,000 dan, Geng Feng 8,400 dan, Jun Chang 2,600 dan, Heng De 2,600 dan, Run Kang 1,600 dan, Shen Chang 7,100 dan, Rui Yuan 1,400 dan, Yu Kang 1,500 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>

<p>Total		843,000</p>
<p>Over 3,000 Bales of Yao Cotton Arrive</p>
<p>Sales of spot cotton are sluggish. Due to the increase in U.S. cotton production, factories have no interest in purchasing. The sources include 3,100 bales of Yao cotton and 900 bales of Tong cotton. The arrival of Yao cotton is relatively high, and prices have fallen by 1.40 yuan.</p>

<p>Reasons for the Slump in the Bombay Cotton Industry</p>
<p>After large-scale bullish investors settled their positions last week, inventories decreased, and trading also became sluggish. Transportation inquiries are extremely poor. Japanese side has inventories that have not been sold, therefore local market prices are depressed. Weather reports are better than before, but the Oomra region has recently had harmful rain. Spot sales are quiet. Local factories have slightly increased their interest in various types of cotton. Attached are the statistics for last week (unit: thousands of bales):</p>

<p>Food</p>
<p>Futures in Flour and Wheat Fall Uniformly</p>
<p>After the flour market opened in the morning, the market showed a uniform downward trend in all months. Quotes for foreign wheat fell by approximately 0.10-0.20 yuan in Chicago and approximately 0.04 yuan in Canada. The market price was initially stable, but the actual sales in the north remained sluggish. The quoted price for spot flour in Tianjin was only 3.52 to 3.50 yuan. This new price caused a uniform loosening of sentiment inside and outside the industry. Bullish investors from Yingkou, Northeast China, sold off their positions, and funds were released into the market. Therefore, the opening prices for all months fell significantly. When the afternoon market opened, due to the stagnation of actual sales and very little buying interest, the sentiment among industry participants was largely weak. As a result, the market situation for all months continued to fall. The Mid-Autumn Festival season is coming to an end, and the purchasing power in various places is naturally declining. Therefore, the market feels very easy to loosen. As a result, the current month fell by 0.035 yuan compared to the previous week, October fell by 0.0525 yuan, November fell by 0.05 yuan, December fell by 0.0525 yuan, January fell by 0.04 yuan, and February fell by 0.045 yuan.</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened in the morning, the market situation in all months generally showed a flat and soft trend. Quotes for foreign wheat fell by approximately 0.10-0.20 yuan in Chicago and approximately 0.04 yuan in Canada. Market sentiment was already weak at the opening because factories showed no interest in purchasing the standard wheat, and spot goods in the market were so abundant. It was not easy to boost outside industry sentiment. Furthermore, after rainfall in various places, the food panic eased somewhat. In terms of rice prices, they also fell significantly from their peak. Therefore, market sentiment gradually weakened, and the market felt looser step by step. When the afternoon market opened, because the flour market had declined, market sentiment was even more sluggish, and buyers were even scarcer. As a result, the decline in all months was also quite large. As a result, September and October fell by 0.09 yuan compared to the previous week, November fell by 0.08 yuan, December fell by 0.13 yuan, January fell by 0.08 yuan, and February fell by 0.10 yuan. The spot wheat market has not been active because flour sales have been flat, and factories have been very unwilling to purchase.</p>
<p>New Early Rice Continues to Decline</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) There are over a dozen sources of goods from various merchants, but the sales market is even more sluggish. Very few out-of-town merchants are visiting the market, so the situation is quiet, and the market situation is weak. The prices of high-quality early rice and late rice have fallen sharply by 0.20-0.30 yuan. Only the highest quality has fallen by about 0.10 yuan. Furthermore, the prices of new early rice and new premium rice continue to decline by about 0.20 yuan. The old glutinous rice lacks supply and is neither good nor bad, and the price of transformed glutinous rice is not being quoted. (North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were over 20 sources of goods from various regions in Hexia. The demand for all goods in the market was weak. The market price of white early rice was down slightly by 0.10-0.20 yuan, and the price of thin rice was fixed. The prices of both old and new premium glutinous rice were down slightly outside the size, the price of new Yang glutinous rice high quality material was down slightly by 0.20 yuan, medium quality was down slightly by 0.30-0.40 yuan, and East Shanghai new early rice was down slightly by 0.30 yuan.</p>
<p>Futures in Foreign Rice Attract Merchant Attention</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for foreign long-grain rice and spot customer cargo weakened. Opening prices in the morning had decreased. Later, as Zhoushan merchants purchased Xiang gravel rice, the market atmosphere perked up, and the futures in foreign rice suddenly attracted customer attention, making the market even more bullish. The futures in Saigon rice rose sharply by 0.05 yuan, and spot goods were also marked up by the cargo owners. Although there were few transactions, the market also had a tendency to increase step by step. A seller of spot foreign rice opened with Saigon No. 1 high-quality Bao Ta brand 700 bags, priced at 11.20 yuan. Hong Kong Yuan rice 100 bags, priced at 12.60 yuan. Both were 0.10 yuan better than last week. They were handled by this street's agents. Although some foreign rice has arrived in recent days, the arriving goods have already been sold ahead of time, and they will be unloaded upon arrival. There is no floating inventory in the market. Furthermore, the cargo that shipped on the 23rd of last month has not yet arrived in Shanghai, and the market is urging its arrival. Therefore, the foreign rice market is standing its ground. Futures in Saigon rice were purchased by Jiujiang merchants for September and October, 1,500 tons at a price of 4.95-5.00 yuan, and for November, 500 tons at a price of 5.05 yuan. The returned goods were also offered at 500 tons, and they were divided up by the Jiangxi merchants who are hoarders on this street, causing the market to become bullish immediately. Over 2,000 bags of customer long-grain rice were offered. Except for 600 bags of gravel rice that Zhoushan purchased, the rest were handled by this street's agents. The market was slightly weak in the morning, but it rebounded by about 0.10 yuan in the afternoon.</p>

<h3 id="e8">Reduction of Railway Freight Rates and Development of Rural Economy (7) by Wu Shaozeng <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>For joint transportation goods, the freight revenue each railway should receive can be proportionally distributed based on the mileage the goods traveled on each line.</p>
<p>The above suggestion breaks various restrictions such as distance (referring to long distances exceeding 500 kilometers) and basic freight rates. Some may consider it shocking. In reality, this type of freight rate is similar to the "Blanket Rates" or "Postage Stamp Rates" that have been prevalent in the United States for a long time. In June 1898, American railways implemented blanket rates (i.e., charging the same freight rate regardless of the route taken), applicable to both classified and unclassified goods. For example, for goods transported from the Missouri River to the Atlantic coast, the freight rate is determined by the blanket rate system, regardless of whether the origin is near the Missouri River or the Atlantic coast. Similarly, goods transported westward within New England are also calculated based on blanket rates, with the intention of enabling New England manufacturers to transport goods westward and compete favorably with factories near raw material production areas, preventing the decline of New England's prosperity. The goods to which blanket rates apply include those easily absorbed by water transportation. For instance, leather shoes produced in Boston in the east, if transported to San Francisco in the west, can follow two routes: one via the transcontinental railway and the other via waterway through the Panama Canal to San Francisco. To prevent the railway from losing this transportation business to waterways, it implements blanket rates. Furthermore, if oranges from California in the west are transported to New York for sale, they will inevitably compete with oranges from Florida in the southeast. If charged at regular freight rates, California orange merchants would be deterred due to losses, and railway transportation and people's consumption would also be affected. Therefore, blanket rates are also applied to such goods. (To be continued)</p>

<p>"Xié háng" (頡頏) means "incompatible." For example, in a war, either you lose or I lose; there is no way for both sides to win. This is "xié háng." The two sides of "xié háng" are completely impossible to unify. Therefore, "xié háng" is merely the opposite, not a contradiction. The two sides of a contradiction, at a certain time, can be compatible, even mutually dependent. This has been pointed out in the previous examples of private life and ideals. However, we cannot say that contradictions are always compatible; they are only compatible at certain times. For example, the chick inside the egg and the eggshell are contradictory. The chick must break the eggshell to come out. This is the resolution of the contradiction. However, before the chick grows to be able to act independently, it can be accommodated within the eggshell and even requires the protection of the eggshell. Therefore, the contradiction between the chick and the eggshell is only compatible before the chick grows up. Once the chick has grown up, it becomes incompatible. Therefore, contradiction and incompatibility are not completely different things. Contradictions only become absolutely incompatible when they develop or grow to their extreme. Before this point, they are still compatible. The meaning of "xié háng," however, is absolute incompatibility. People who see contradiction as "xié háng" believe that whenever they encounter opposing things, they must immediately fight to the death, refusing to calmly adapt to the development trends of things and take appropriate actions. For example, when the chick has not yet grown, it should have been hatched by the hen, but instead, they are eager to break the eggshell. This behavior not only fails to resolve the contradiction but also kills the potential chick. Using the example of life and ideals, if someone believes that life and ideals are contradictory, they immediately abandon ideals and only care about short-term gains, not knowing that there is a possibility of achieving ideals through the practice of life. This is the drawback of mistaking contradiction for "xié háng."</p>
<p>Contradiction is a constantly developing opposing action within unity. The resolution of contradiction is only achieved when it develops to a certain degree.</p>

<p>— by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 1: A Ghost Carries a Cart from Guanzhong, a Lonely Traveler Crosses the Rapids, and a Ferryman Mourns the People of Qin</p>
<p>However, there was one thing that Li Shilian found particularly interesting: between the houses with dismantled roofs, there were still houses with yellow earthen walls and wooden doors. On the wooden door hung a plaque, the very plaque of the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Collection Sub-Office of a certain district of a certain county of a certain province. He couldn't help but exclaim "Oh." He thought to himself that the tobacco and alcohol tax still had great potential. But his "Oh" had already alarmed everyone in the car. Cheng Zhiqian said, "Mr. Li, what are your thoughts?" Li Shilian said, "I feel that even in relatively lively places, there are still such houses. Who knows what it's like elsewhere?" Secretary Chang said, "Don't look at how desolate this place is. It is said to be near the capital of the Qin Kingdom. Thousands of years ago, Emperor Qin unified China here and built the Great Wall. To say that the present is not as good as the past, it's really not turning the clock back." Cheng Zhiqian said, "The Qin capital, Xianyang? Have we arrived at Xianyang yet?" Secretary Chang said, "Look, isn't that the ancient ferry of Xianyang?" As he spoke, the car rolled over a small slope and onto the inner mudflat. Sure enough, there was a river in front of them, the water a muddy yellow. On the southwest corner of the river, there was a semi-circle of yellow earth slope. On the side facing the river, two slender arrow towers jutted out from the earthen wall, one tall and one short, one far and one near, complementing each other. The car drove straight to the riverbank, and the current seemed very swift. Four or five ferries were moored on the riverbank, looking very strange. They had no awnings but were flat, and vehicles and mules could cross on them. The bow and stern were both square. If the stern wasn't slightly higher, it would look just like an enlarged square-toed shoe. A larger ferry came over from the other side and docked at the shore. Two sedans were parked on the deck, as well as four or five carrying poles. Among them was a girl of sixteen or seventeen, wearing a straight-striped blue cloth short jacket, with two silver earrings hanging from her ears. She was clearly a country girl, but she had cut her hair short. When she saw this car, which was a sedan type, different from the cargo and passenger cars running on the main road, she just stared. When she happened to see Cheng Zhiqian also sizing her up, she lowered her head and walked away. (16)</p>

<h3 id="e13">Tomb of Zhuge Jin <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Jingyu</p>
<p>In the southwest corner of Xianxi, Fengxian, no more than two li away, there is an ancient tomb. The villagers call it the Zhuge Tomb.</p>
<p>What is the construction of this tomb like? Due to the passage of time, it is deeply sunk into the ground and cannot be seen. Only a mound of wasteland and a stone stele of the tomb ridge remain.</p>
<p>The tablet system is very simple, only engraving the five characters "Tomb of Zhuge Jin" in the size of a bowl mouth, the font is definitely not Han Li, but a very clumsy form of true script, so at first glance, it is almost suspected to come from the good people's transmission. According to the legends of the elders in the countryside, regarding the history of this tomb, there is a story similar to mythology:</p>
<p>During the "Tianqi" period of the late Ming Dynasty, villagers cultivated here, and the ground suddenly collapsed, forming a cave. Entering it, it was very vast and dark, making it impossible to distinguish the path. Touching forward, the hand touched an object, which was cool to the bone. It was a stone wall! Advancing along the wall, reaching the end, he saw a jar of burning torches, the light blazing! Vaguely there was a room, like a hall, a huge coffin hanging in it, and in front of the coffin there was a table on which various unknown animal-shaped objects were listed. The villagers saw the situation and thought it was a ghost; therefore, they broke the jar with the farming tools they held, turned around and thought of escaping, their feet stumbled on a stone, fell to the ground, got up suddenly, broke it again, and ran away wildly. The story was spread to the countryside, and the viewers gathered! The village chief was afraid of causing trouble, and urgently reported to the county; the county magistrate came to examine it, and recited the inscription he destroyed, recognizing it as the burial place of Zhuge Ziyu in the Three Kingdoms: Therefore, he ordered the servants to block the hole, and set up a stone to record it, that is, the one that stands on the tomb today!</p>
<p>According to the ancients, when the coffin was being buried, a huge jar was often used in front of the coffin, half-filled with lacquer oil, and lit with cotton rope, closed in the soil, even if the air was isolated, it would never be extinguished, and the lacquer oil would not dry up; its name was called "Everlasting Light!" Extremely ancient tombs are almost nineteen out of ten; it is only because the villagers are ignorant, have little knowledge and are strange, so that the ancient objects before thousands of years have suddenly suffered the misfortune of destruction! How unfortunate is it not?</p>

<p>— Xie</p>
<p>The five-year-old girl in the pavilion room went to the alley with the eleven-year-old boy in the front building in the evening to play. There were many people cooling off in the alley, squeezing out and stopping, and the girl was knocked down, her little buttocks just sitting in the sewage, so that the clothes that had just been bathed and changed were stained with mud. The eleven-year-old boy hurried to help her back. When the girl's mother saw that her child's clothes were dirty, she couldn't help but get angry and slapped her in the face, causing the girl to cry loudly. At the same time, she scolded: Why are you going to play with bad kids? The sister-in-law in the front building heard that her son had caused trouble to other people's children, and scolded her son for being a bad kid, so she got so angry that she couldn't breathe, pulled her son to the sister-in-law's pavilion room, and punished him to kneel down and apologize. The child didn't listen, so she grabbed his ear and took him back to the front building, and then closed the door. People downstairs only heard the sound of "patting" upstairs, and the sound of the child crying, and the sound of the sister-in-law scolding, echoed together. This sound continued for a long time, and the people downstairs hurried up to persuade them, but the sister-in-law had already closed the door very tightly and could not be knocked open wildly. Moreover, the sound of "patting" inside became tighter and louder, the child's cry became louder and more miserable, and the sister-in-law's scolding became more and more urgent and higher. Someone on the opposite balcony looked down at the sister-in-law's room, and only saw the sister-in-law with disheveled hair, holding a two-foot-long rattan whip, and slashing up and down at the child with murderous intent. The child staggered up and down, blocking with both hands up and down, and his tragic cries sounded like a pig being slaughtered with a knife. The people on the balcony really couldn't bear to see it, and shouted to stop. The sister-in-law heard the persuasion, as if adding fuel to the fire, and the murderous appearance became even more terrible, and the whip was more densely covered like raindrops. The child rolled on the floor, and the people on the balcony hurriedly retreated to avoid increasing the sister-in-law's anger and causing the child to suffer more, but the sound of "patting" still did not stop, and the cries of anger and scolding also played together. After about six or seven minutes, the sound of "patting" gradually thinned out and disappeared, and the cries of anger and scolding also gradually subsided into the darkness.</p>
<p>The next day, the child was still able to come downstairs to walk around, but the bare upper body was covered with purplish-black scars, countless hundreds of them, and there were also countless purplish-black strips under both knees. The part above the knees was invisible because the pants covered them. Alas, the child training of Chinese mothers!</p>

<p>The moon palace and cloud corridor are gracefully opened, and the jade pendants are clustered with immortals. This place is really similar to the Moon Palace, and the mountains and rivers are painted for thousands of miles.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Penglai Pavilion <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Hong</p>
<p>In the past, perhaps not many people paid attention to Penglai Pavilion. It was only because General Feng Yuxiang, the Christian general, made a special trip to visit it this spring, which made this scenic spot, which was buried in Donglu, gradually become popular.</p>
<p>Penglai Pavilion is located about one li outside the north gate of Penglai County, Jiaodong. (The opening of The Travels of Lao Ts'an says that Penglai Pavilion is outside the east gate of Penglai County. This old man must have turned around.) It is located on a mountain and faces the water, and the terrain is extremely beautiful. The so-called "Dan Cliff Wonderland" refers to this. In addition to Penglai Pavilion, there are many other temples on this mountain, and there are also many inscriptions by famous people of past dynasties. Su Xueshi Dongpo once served as a prime minister here, so he also added a lot of beautiful stories to the lake and mountains. Now, the statue of this old gentleman is still sitting upright in the temple, receiving the respect of tourists.</p>
<p>To the west of the pavilion is Chengbixuan, and to the east is Guanlanting. Both are places for tourists to rest and a good place to escape the heat. Whenever the sun sets, overlooking from the window, Changshan is in sight, and fishermen's songs fill the ears. There is a real feeling of wanting to become an immortal, so people often set up banquets here to meet friends during the hot summer.</p>
<p>In addition to Penglai Pavilion, Penglai County also has the other ten beautiful sceneries, such as "Bronze Well and Golden Waves," "Leaking Sky and Silver Rain," "Lion Cave and Smoke Clouds," "Ten Thousand Hectoliters of Pearls," "Mirage," "Sunrise Fusang," "Evening Tide and New Moon," "Fisherman's Dyke and Singing Table," "High Pavilion Lingkong," and "Ten Thousand Miles of Qingpo." However, some of them are famous but have no substance, but the "Mirage" is a rare beautiful scene.</p>
<p>Penglai Pavilion has long been in disrepair due to its age and is already dilapidated. When General Wu Fuwei was stationed in Zhongzhou, he once launched a renovation, but unfortunately, this plan could not be fully realized. Now, it has become the palace of the Eighth Grandpa soldiers, and tourists have no way to visit it.</p>
<h3 id="e17">White Ox Village <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Jinyue</p>
<p>A snow-white ox, as white as snow, ambled across the fragrant grass embankment, appearing all the more solemn and tranquil.</p>
<p>Not far from the northern fence of Fengjing, a stream meandered, and trees cast shadows, creating a very serene and beautiful landscape. There was a small village called White Ox Village. It is said that during the Song Dynasty, the famous Chen Shunyu (a contemporary of Su Dongpo), tired of officialdom, built a few thatched huts here, tilling the land and studying. He often rode a white ox, and in the fields and on the embankments, he would happily recite poetry and play the flute, completely at ease. Later, Hong Kunxuan wrote a "Song of the White Ox Hermit Riding a Calf," describing his reclusive life:</p>
<p>A village of sedge grass, a boundless sight,</p>
<p>Ten miles of Jiangnan, spring intricately woven.</p>
<p>By the green maple path, as the sun sets,</p>
<p>He mounts a black ox, unrecognized.</p>
<p>Rice paddies and desolate lands, veiled in misty haze,</p>
<p>A light raincoat and short bamboo hat, enjoying the cool breeze.</p>
<p>East suburban rain clears, muddy path slick,</p>
<p>Four hooves crush the red flowers of the stream.</p>
<p>Having presented myriad words, he returns early,</p>
<p>The new laws of Xining are too hasty.</p>
<p>His distant teachings are reminiscent of He Fen,</p>
<p>Hemp and mulberry thrive by the good stream.</p>
<p>South Mountain white rocks, clear and cold water,</p>
<p>Who sings endlessly through the long night?</p>
<p>At dusk, halfway through the meal, under the bronze axle,</p>
<p>Tomorrow, he'll study scriptures, horns in sight.</p>
<p>After Shunyu's death, Su Dongpo wrote an article mourning him, showing the same deep affection as Ouyang Xiu's preface to Mei Shengyu's poetry collection.</p>
<p>As for the origin of White Ox Village, according to the village elders, "In the past, on moonlit nights, a large, ownerless white ox would appear here, squatting and chewing grass. Curious villagers would try to catch it, but it would quickly run into the pond and disappear. One time, a villager managed to grab its chain by the pond and desperately dragged it ashore, but the ox bit his leg. The villager only managed to retrieve a small piece of the chain, which turned out to be made of pure gold. He was overjoyed, but unfortunately, the wound never healed, and it wasn't until the piece of gold chain completely vanished that he died.

<h3 id="e18">The Scent of Imperial Incense, Faintly Lingering <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>— Original by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>At that moment, our chauffeur was focusing all his energy on his task, as he had been ordered by Qing Shan to ensure that the Empress Dowager's carriage stopped exactly in the center of the platform so that she could step onto the apricot-yellow felt mat when she alighted.</p>
<p>On this day, important officials from Tianjin and the surrounding areas, both civil and military, had arrived very early to await the imperial arrival. Each person, according to their rank, had dressed with as much care as possible. As a result, when we arrived, they were already lined up in a very long row. The red and green colors were dazzling, almost making it impossible to open one's eyes. As soon as they saw the imperial arrival, they knelt silently along the outer edge of the platform. Yuan Shikai himself was kneeling alone, prostrate in front of everyone else!</p>
<p>The train rolled slowly past them and finally came to a complete stop. I usually loved to watch a lively scene, but seeing these statue-like officials, I couldn't help but feel uncomfortable. Especially their expressions; one could say that not a single one was not unpleasant. Their heads were lowered past their chests, their eyes fixed on the ground, and they didn't even seem to dare to breathe, making it hard to believe that this was a genuine display of respect. However, their attire was still a beautiful spectacle. Most of them had peacock feather plumes on their hats. Peacock feathers were originally very beautiful, possessing their own radiance. Coupled with the strong sunlight that shone through the awning, all the peacock feathers seemed to turn into golden leaves, with brilliant golden light shimmering everywhere. Seeing this, I almost suspected: (125)</p>

<h3 id="e19">Please Consider the Objective Environment <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Maoyong</p>
<p>In Sichuan, there were two monks, one rich and one so poor that he only had a bowl and a begging cup. Once, they met and both said they wanted to make a pilgrimage to the South Sea. But the rich monk planned and planned, considering how much travel money to bring, what kind of ship to take, how to prepare his luggage, and whether there would be any dangers on the road. After much planning, he still couldn't make up his mind. After a year or two, he still couldn't set out. Who knew that during his indecision, the poor monk had already walked to the South Sea and returned.</p>
<p>The lesson of this story is that the power of subjective will can overcome the objective material environment. Peng Duanshu of the Qing Dynasty used this story to prove the following theory: "Are things in the world difficult or easy? If you do them, then the difficult becomes easy; if you don't do them, then the easy becomes difficult."</p>
<p>Indeed, this makes some sense. But what if the rich monk's will was as strong as the poor monk's? Undoubtedly, the South Sea would have let the rich monk arrive first, because he had money and traveling would be much easier for him.</p>
<p>Regarding the difficulty or ease of achieving something, the decisive power of the material environment is ultimately greater than everything else.</p>
<p>Opponents of the current Mass Language movement often say this: People who advocated vernacular Chinese during the May Fourth Movement were able to immediately produce vernacular writing, but those who advocate Mass Language now only know how to shout slogans and can't produce anything of substance. This shows the emptiness and boredom of the Mass Language movement—they think this is a powerful argument, but in fact, it's completely unreasonable.</p>
<p>We must understand that Mass Language is connected to all the problems of the masses. It is by no means simply a language reform movement; it is a movement within the larger movement to improve the entire life of the masses.</p>
<p>However, we must also know that the Mass Language movement and the Vernacular Chinese movement have two different aspects, which are their respective objective environments. During the May Fourth era, the bourgeois class was already quite powerful economically. Even the feudal warlords who monopolized political power at the time had to rely on them. At the same time, they used their own money to train their own intellectuals in universities at home and abroad. With economic power, their own cultural workers, and practical political movements, the success of the bourgeois class was naturally easier. Vernacular Chinese was created by the bourgeois class's own cultural workers, so it was naturally quick to produce.</p>
<p>Look at the masses connected to the current Mass Language movement. How can their economic lives and cultural levels be compared to those of the bourgeois class of that time? Isn't it too impatient to demand that they immediately produce Mass Language or Mass Culture? The rich monk in Sichuan can't afford a plane and certainly won't reach the South Sea in a few days.</p>
<p>The people who are now advocating Mass Language are not the cultural workers of the masses themselves. They only feel that Mass Language is something that should exist and can help the masses, so they are helping to create it. They are just helping and don't believe they can create a Mass Language model themselves. Authentic Mass Language can only be established by the masses themselves when their level is improved. Therefore, those who are demanding that the current advocates of Mass Language produce Mass Language are even more impatient.</p>
<p>The Mass Language movement is a difficult movement, but it is not something that cannot be successful. To succeed, we must first create a good objective environment.</p>
<h3 id="e20">From History to Collections <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>— Ling Mo</p>
<p>Although the compilation of Chinese historical books is not entirely satisfactory, the history section is already the most complete within the so-called four categories [of traditional Chinese bibliography]. The classics and philosophical works are hopeless, but fortunately, they won't be added to. The collection section is also a vast category, but it urgently needs reform.</p>
<p>The complete works of ancient Chinese people cannot be compared with the complete works of Western writers. Western writers mostly develop within a specialized field, while Chinese writers discuss everything. Take any of the complete works of Han, Liu, Ou, or Su, for example. There are official documents and social correspondence, but there must also be pure prose and poetry to show that the writer is a literati. Such complete works must be carefully selected and weeded out.</p>
<p>Writings such as imperial edicts, memorials, and petitions can mostly be found in books recording institutions of past dynasties, which have already been preserved. There is no need to preserve them in collections. Writings such as biographies and epitaphs only have value in historical terms. They should be compiled into books such as Collected Biographies and Epitaphs of Past Dynasties for use as historical materials. There is no need for them to have wide circulation. In addition, similar methods can be adopted for anything that does not belong to pure literature, leaving behind only a pure essence. Naturally, there are also some collection categories. Writings in the Taiping Guangji [an anthology of stories] were considered unimportant at the time, so they were rejected and set aside. Today, we should use the same method to set aside what we think should be set aside. This is a necessary general collection. As for general collections in the style of literary selections from past dynasties, they are optional.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people feel that complete works are also useful, but this won't cause any dispute. The existing editions of complete works should be enough to meet the needs of these people. We hope that the publishing industry will not always just reprint the same things.</p>

<p>— Kong Gong</p>
<p>Some years ago, someone said something like this: People in our scientific world only know about light gas and oxygen, but don't know about so-called "refined qi."</p>
<p>Those who only know about light gas, oxygen, and inert gas on one side, and those who only know about refined qi, vulgar qi, and clumsy qi on the other, are inevitably shocked by each other. These are mostly colorless and odorless, but the latter has no substance and cannot have an atomic weight, naturally burning or supporting combustion.</p>
<p>In times of conflict between the old and the new, the arguments on both sides tend to be extreme. Holding onto fifty miles, one cannot but attack a hundred miles, which is a matter of course. However, putting aside the merits of the battle, just looking at these words themselves, they are all somewhat pretentious.</p>
<p>Looking closely at those who burn test tubes and wield hammers, are they all just ordinary people who are ignorant of elegance and refinement, except for their mechanical lives? It is not so in the West; on the contrary, they have a better understanding of literature, an appreciation of art, and a comprehension of music. Their refinement and nobility are more widespread, greater, and more profound. On the one hand, science museums are built large; on the other hand, art galleries and music academies reach even higher.</p>
<p>Conversely, if this science of burning light gas and refining oxygen has no relation to life and no use, then this science is not worth studying. Science has its own truth, but it is not the only truth. All thoughts converge on one point, and all paths lead to the same destination. The future is aimed at human happiness. What is Buddhism without itself? What is science without life? There is really no need for any "debate" about such a simple truth.</p>
<p>If one lives in a house built by science, covers oneself with a blanket made by science, and eats medicine made by science when sick, can it be said that science does not dominate everything of mankind? It certainly dominates, but this did not fall from the moon or planets. It was created by mankind itself. It is mankind dominating everything of itself, and no one else or thing should be thanked. In addition to living in houses, covering oneself with blankets, and eating medicine, mankind also has other things to do.</p>
<p>Now it is understood that people in the scientific world are those who seek a state of happiness in life and who hope that mankind will reach a state of goodness and beauty. The debate over inert qi and refined qi, the debate over science and life, are all dry stakes.</p>
<h3 id="e23">True Essence of the Mass Language (Part 2) <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— Li Jinxi</p>
<p>Furthermore, among the twenty Hinayana [Theravada] schools, the initial division into the "Mahāsāṃghika" [Great Community] and "Sthaviravāda" [Elders] schools, being mutually opposing, seemed to have a class nature, but in reality, it was due to different locations for the compilation of the scriptures (It is said that in the year of the Buddha's death, the scriptures were compiled in two places, inside and outside the cave. Inside the cave, there were many elders of the Sthaviravāda school, with Kāśyapa at the head, hence the name "Sthaviravāda"; outside the cave, there were many young monks, with no separate leader, hence the name "Mahāsāṃghika"). From then on, it evolved into a divergence in doctrines (It is said that a hundred years after the Buddha's death, the Bhikkhu Mahadeva appeared, and many descendants of the compilation outside the cave attached to him, hence taking the old name "Mahāsāṃghika"; those inside the cave opposed Mahadeva's teachings, so they also inherited the old name "Sthaviravāda." Later, the two schools further divided into eighteen schools, totaling twenty Hinayana schools). In short, "Mahāsāṃghika" became a common term for Buddhists after the Middle Ages, and its meaning is very egalitarian. It only requires one condition: Buddhist believers, even demons, humans, ghosts, or animals such as horses, cattle, chickens, and dogs, can all join this "Mahāsāṃghika" (When "Mahāsāṃghika" is added to other nouns, such as "Mahāsāṃghika seal," it refers to a seal used by a temple in common. There are quite a few other examples, such as the "Mahāsāṃghika adornment" in the Pure Land scriptures and the "Mahāsāṃghika awe of power" for novice Bodhisattvas, but I won't list them all).</p>
<p>(3) In modern common usage, "Mahāsāṃghika" simply means "the masses." Not only are there no class, religious, or racial restrictions, but they don't even have to gather in one place. Scattered people can sometimes also be called "Mahāsāṃghika." This meaning is commonly used and doesn't require examples. (When added to other nouns, such as the extremely vicious cursing term in southern dialects, "Mahāsāṃghika cub," it also proves this meaning.)</p>
<p>(4) In modern times, it is also used to translate Western "imported goods." "Mahāsāṃghika" is equivalent to the English "The masses" (or translated as "the crowd"). This original term already has a class nature (hence it is also translated as "the common people" or "the lower class"), originating in 1886 (the twelfth year of the Guangxu reign in the Qing Dynasty) when British Prime Minister Gladstone used this term as a relative term to "The Classes" (or translated as "the upper class"), thus forming a new trend in usage (see page 207 of volume six of the Oxford New English Dictionary). Recently, it has been gradually used for the majority of the collective people (such as the so-called "laboring masses," "proletarian masses," "peasant masses," etc.: when added to other nouns, labor unions are called "mass organizations," general strikes are called "mass strikes," collective coercion is called "mass action," and group movements that only seek daily benefits without regard to ideology are called "mass movements," etc.), seemingly returning to the old Chinese meaning (but this collective of farmers and workers is voluntary, although there are also those who are "requisitioned"): or used for the basic unit of a party (such as labor unions being called "mass organizations" in a vanguard party) and ordinary members in relation to cadres (also used by labor organizations). But when we use "Mahāsāṃghika" as an adjective and add it to other nouns, it is often equivalent to the English "Popular" (or translated as "common people's" or "vernacular"), and "Mass Language" is one of them. Forgive my ignorance, I have only seen "Popular" in English and have not found "Mass-laugnage" (Mass-literature—"Mass Literature" does exist, but it is ambiguous, and will be discussed in another section). In fact, those of us who are engaged in the National Language Movement only care about practical research work and do not crave new colored nouns like "Mass Language" because we can create them at will by piling up Chinese characters. But the ancients said it well: "Some follow old names, and some create new names." Since everyone is launching "new names" and happily discussing them, it is also acceptable to go along. However, the definition of "new names" must be agreed upon first. Based on the above-mentioned etymologies, I always feel that no matter what kind of "Mahāsāṃghika" is added to "Language," it immediately becomes "universal and equal," turning into the meaning of "Popularization" (because the meaning of the character "Language" is the "Language" of "speech," not the "Language" of "slogan"). "Names follow their masters," and the correct interpretation of "Mahāsāṃghika" should be the (3) definition that the current native masses have already become accustomed to: "Mahāsāṃghika is simply the masses." Then the true essence of "Mass Language" can be known!</p>
<p>But the matter is ultimately not that simple. I respectfully summarize the various current interpretations of "Mass Language" into three definitions, add comments to each, and create a short essay, which has already been published: (1) Does Mass Language really have "class nature"? (2) Is Mass Language contradictory to "dialect"? (3) Does Mass Language need a "standard language"?</p>
<p>Synthesizing the above three different definitions, weeding out the chaff and extracting the essence, understanding their purpose, and analyzing their logic, I summarize them into a few words to await judgment:</p>
<p>"Mass Language" is a standard dialect that is constructive and does not have class nature, existing in parallel with other "mother tongue" dialects that differ from the standard; it evolves with the times, expands with transportation, is enriched by culture, and beautified by literature and art: all of this is natural. We build "Mass Language" from an educational point of view, which is to unify the conflicts and contradictions between the consciousness of the "masses" who are lagging behind and the "masses" who are advancing, so that this standard dialect becomes a "common language" that "the majority of people in a country and nation can simultaneously understand and speak to each other."</p>
<p>If the definition of "Mass Language" is indeed like this, then I finally don't know what its similarities and differences are with "National Language" or "Vernacular"!</p>
<p>Originally, they are "the same in substance but different in name"!</p>
<p>Originally, all debates are just manipulating a few different names!</p>
<p>Originally, all problems cannot be practically solved without practical work.</p>
<p>In the previous section of this article published yesterday, on line eight from the top, the character "Language" was omitted below "occupational use," and on line thirty-five, the character "place" was omitted between "city wall." Also, on line twenty-five from the top, "ancient already has three," the three is a mistake for "of"; on line thirty-six, "Zhang Fu" is a mistake for "Zhang Fu"; on line thirty-eight, "Scholar Gong" is a mistake for "Soil Gong"; on line six from the bottom, the word "hua" in "official instruction" is a mistake for "gu"; on line twenty-five, "four big already on," "big" is a mistake for "person," and is hereby corrected.</p>

<p>Gently, quietly, lift the melancholy curtain, just a small corner, enough for melancholy eyes to peek out. Melancholy banana trees rustle in the wind, without rain, they seem to take pleasure in evil. Do not shake down the worn-out, tattered leaves, do not disturb the cold shadows on the ground, do not awaken the aging nightingale, urging a mournful, intermittent dirge. Faint clouds, sparse clouds, surround the autumn moon. The autumn moon sighs, coldly glancing at the autumn courtyard. Its radiance has been lost, like the congealed tears of a widow, quietly lying in the discolored corners of her eyes, only blurred and faint, forming a piece of melancholy. A melancholy heart is saddened, and the melancholy curtain is lowered, gently, quietly.</p>

<h3 id="e25">The Puppet State Sacrifices to Confucius <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Gong</p>
<p>Confucius is in luck this year. The grand ceremony of sacrificing to Confucius is rare since the Republic of China. Now, the puppet state also wants to hold a grand ceremony.</p>
<p>When I was a child, Confucius' birthday was just a day off from school. Society had nothing to do with it. The wild grass in the Confucian temples in the city not only grew in the courtyard, but also on the hall, and no one cared about it. Now it's different. They have been renovated and look brand new. On the day of the sacrifice to Confucius, grand ceremonies were held in Confucian temples in various provinces. People from military, political, party, academic, and business circles gathered to perform rituals and used ancient music and instruments to promote the classics. This is a phenomenon of national revival. The elderly and young people are all happy, and even Confucius will smile when he eats cold meat.</p>
<p>However, it is reported that the puppet organization has also decided to sacrifice to Confucius on September 13th, forcing the puppet provincial and municipal government offices to hold grand commemorations on that day. All officials above the section chief level of the puppet organs will participate, and the so-called Wangdao Education Film will be shown. When this news reaches the ears of the people of the Republic of China, we should pay attention to it.</p>
<p>What we should pay attention to is: Is the puppet organization worthy of holding a grand ceremony of sacrificing to Confucius, and also showing Wangdao's educational film?</p>
<p>Confucius wrote the "Spring and Autumn Annals, and the rebellious ministers and traitors were afraid." What are the so-called rebellious ministers and traitors? Puyi, Zheng Xiaoxu, and others are undoubtedly standard rebellious ministers and traitors. According to the theory of the New Text School of the Han Dynasty in the late Qing Dynasty, Confucius's learning was originally the doctrine of "following Zhou," so he said, "How luxuriant is its culture! I follow Zhou." Until he defended himself and opposed Lu, Confucius's learning greatly changed. He knew that the Zhou Dynasty's system was determined by a group of emperors, princes, and high officials, protecting themselves and oppressing the common people. Therefore, he changed it to the doctrine of "valuing the people" and wanted to make his own rituals and music. So he also said that he would follow the time of Xia, ride the chariot of Yin, and wear the crown of Zhou, reforming and changing the law, which is obvious. He also wrote the "Spring and Autumn Annals." It can be seen from the words that everyone has the right to participate in national politics and cannot allow a group of nobles to do whatever they want. He first set an example himself, praising those who should be praised and criticizing those who should be criticized, like an emperor awarding rewards and punishments. In fact, this duty of awarding rewards and punishments originally belonged to the people. They have been used to reversing it, and Confucius used the "Spring and Autumn Annals" to turn it over. --The New Text School of the Han Dynasty in the late Qing Dynasty based its theory on Gongyang Gao, who praised Confucius as a populist politician. In today's terms, Confucius was a revolutionary who sought the interests of the masses. (It is not certain that the words Confucius said in the "Analects" were still the mass language of that time.)</p>
<p>Perhaps the reason why our Republic of China respects and sacrifices to Confucius is because he was a revolutionary who sought the interests of the masses? Then, the puppet organization, that is, Manchukuo, now also respects and sacrifices to Confucius and is still promoting Wangdao. Isn't this a contradictory and ridiculous thing? The puppet organization's Manchukuo system is monarchical--Puyi's becoming an executive is not enough, he insists on being an emperor, which is clear evidence. Confucius's learning is truly beneficial to democratic countries. Only our Republic of China is qualified to respect and sacrifice to Confucius. That puppet organization Manchukuo is not qualified to respect and sacrifice to Confucius. Moreover, that puppet organization Manchukuo is a puppet of others, doing whatever it wants, "oppressing the common people," and has become a tool for the puppet show's string pullers, raising horses and training soldiers everywhere to provoke. How can it be worthy of any Wangdao?</p>
<p>However, the puppet organization Manchukuo also respects and sacrifices to Confucius. What is the intention? Originally, the first principle of Confucianism is to respect the emperor. Even according to the theory of modern Confucianism, although Confucius was a populist, he was a populist who absolutely obeyed under the emperor, just like the doctrine of Jesus, which requires civilians to pursue freedom and equality within the scope of obedience to the emperor. That is to say, civilians "have the right to participate in national politics," but only with the emperor's permission. Now, the puppet organization Manchukuo claims to be a monarchical system. They can just use this point of Confucius's learning to sell their policy of deceiving the people. Therefore, the puppet organization Manchukuo also wants to respect and sacrifice to our Chinese Confucius. As for Wangdao's education, it is the best tool for the puppet organization Manchukuo to anesthetize our compatriots in the Northeast. How can they not use it?</p>
<p>From this point of view, although Confucius smiles to us in China, he is very unhappy with the puppet state.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Record of the Skin Party <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>— Lao Chui</p>
<p>The establishment of our party has a long history, with its origins dating back to the Guangxu and Xuantong eras. I am a later member, so I do not have in-depth knowledge of the party's founding history.</p>
<p>The purpose of our party is completely different from the San Kai Party, the Communist Party, the Axe Gang, the "Chai Bai" Party (confidence tricksters) etc. Our party takes "skin talk" (frivolous banter) as its core principle, hence the name "Skin Party." The members of our party include Liao Afeng, Zhu Asan, Tao Niu, Zhu Dakuaitou, and myself, though I'm probably still just a minor role player. (The above names are mostly special nicknames for our party comrades.)</p>
<p>The party's platform follows the "Six No's" doctrine: no politics, no society, no officialdom, no economics, no proper serious talk, and no discussion of painful or tragic events. The qualifications for joining are also very simple: just an introduction from one or more members, and the ability to say three lines of "skin talk." If someone can be called a pig, a nobody, or an embarrassment without blushing or becoming flustered, they are qualified.</p>
<p>Due to a lack of funds, our party has no fixed meeting place. Therefore, gatherings usually take place in mid-range hotels, mostly because we can't afford the grand ones, and the small hotels near Zhengjia Muqiao are too embarrassing. Besides, most of our party members are busy making a living in various places. A real "skin talk" conference of our party seems a long way off.</p>
<p>To connect with party members and share information, we often use letters. Therefore, we often address each other as "Skin Brother" or "Skin Fellow," avoiding formal terms like "Esteemed Sir," "Respectfully Yours," "Humbly Announcing," or "Wishing You Well." The content of the letters also strictly adheres to the "Six No's." In this regard, the party's rules are strict, and no one dares to violate them.</p>
<p>When party comrades meet, they always call each other by nicknames, not using terms like "brother." During gatherings, the more jokes told, the better, and the wittier the banter, the better. The goal is to make everyone present laugh until they double over, ensuring that no one is silent or feels lonely.</p>
<p>In short, our party's "skin talk" uses sarcasm, gaining advantages, and speaking "dead talk" (meaningless nonsense) as the only principles. Comrades' parents and mothers-in-law are often the targets of attacks, often causing them distress. In particular, those who seek to gain advantages suffer the most. Therefore, my writing may also have a bit of a flippant tone, and I don't know if I offend others or if I am wrong. This is probably due to the party's training.</p>
<p>When our party comrades are chatting, if a non-member happens to come by and suddenly hears our lively banter, those who are more proper will often blush and be amazed. Those who are slightly unhappy may join in the battle, becoming happy and forgetting their worries. Therefore, I once heard a non-member say that if we could be so happy every day, we would surely live to be eight hundred years old, or at least four or five hundred years old.</p>
<p>Our party member Liao Afeng has a very serious stomach illness. Everyone says he is going to die, and he himself knows he is going to die. But now, not only is he not dead, but he is getting better day by day. Perhaps it is due to the benefits of "skin talk."</p>
<p>If someone is frustrated, in an unpleasant situation, or narrow-minded, joining our party will eliminate all worries and allow them to enter the realm of longevity.</p>

<p>Editor's note: Although this article seems like a humorous piece, it is all based on facts. Although they live together all day long, they do not speak of righteousness. However, they do not do evil or wrong either. Therefore, although they gather in groups, they do not rob. Although they are naughty, they do not do evil. Although they are idle, they mostly have jobs. This is why the "Skin Party" is what it is.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Sheep <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— A Ping</p>
<p>I've been living here for nearly three months, and only yesterday did I discover that behind those two big doors across the street is a large-scale sheep pen. The mystery of the miserable cries I often heard in the middle of the night was also solved.</p>
<p>Yesterday I came home especially late. As I turned into my lane, I was blocked by a flock of sheep, numbering over a hundred. They were all connected by ropes. The leader pulled the end of the rope, dragging them towards the gate, while the people behind waved thin bamboo poles at the sheep. The sheep seemed to know what this gate led to, struggling and trampling on each other, hoping to escape the power of the ropes and bamboo poles. The oppressed cries in the quiet autumn night reminded me of another similar situation.</p>
<p>I had insomnia last night. Usually, when I heard these miserable cries, I hated them for disturbing my good dreams, and I angrily turned over and went back to sleep. But today, having witnessed the scene, the person pulling the rope planted his feet like a boxer, his entire strength extending to his thick arms. He leaned back, forming an acute angle of forty degrees with the ground. The leading sheep, directly affected by the rope, stretched its neck, but its four legs tried hard to retreat. Every sheep was desperately fighting its last battle. In this narrow doorway, the sheep and the people were at odds. However, the bamboo poles rained down on them. Those who were hit tried to retreat, but the second blow came again, and a series of miserable bleats seemed to still be in my ears. Turning and tossing, I couldn't sleep well all night.</p>
<p>When I woke up this morning, I looked at the two doors across the street from the window. Like a stubborn woman, I thought about this problem again. Humans are truly cruel animals. I am naturally a part of this cruelty. Although I have not pulled the rope or waved the bamboo pole, I watched this tragedy with my own eyes, and there was another similar situation. At that time, I just covered my ears. Thinking like this, I seemed to be repenting to this group of sheep! I couldn't help but think of going to the sheep pen to see what was going on. Were the sheep from last night alright?</p>
<p>The old man guarding the gate was very friendly. I told him what I wanted, and he opened the door and led me in. I had just come in from a bright place, and the inside was as dark as hell. Only a foul smell rushed from my nose. After standing firm, I found that there was a skylight of several square feet on the roof, which was the only light in this sheep pen. The sheep pen was very large and divided into many fences. The old man told me that this was the price difference of the sheep. There were more than five hundred sheep in total. Of course, I didn't recognize the sheep from last night, or maybe they had been classified as the owner's investment allocation. There were ten sheep in each fence, and a lot of green grass was laid out in front of them. They were all eating, sleeping, and playing leisurely. The struggle from last night had long since become peaceful.</p>
<p>I regretted it very much when I came back, regretting that I had made a number one fool of myself, suddenly sympathizing with the sheep. Their struggles and miserable cries were because they didn't know there was delicious green grass inside. Moreover, humans use sheep as food, just as a certain type of animal (including humans) uses humans as food. Survival of the fittest is the principle of natural selection. Even if everyone in the world became a fool like me, it would not reverse it. Thinking of my insomnia last night, it was a pointless loss.</p>
<h3 id="e28">A Record of Strolling Through a Department Store <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>— Hong Ben</p>
<p>After submitting a manuscript to the X newspaper, it was still early when I came out. I looked listlessly at the newspaper stand for a while, and then turned to the tram stop at the ball park. I originally wanted to take the tram home. Suddenly, the excitement of the big sale at the X Company across the street shook my heart that wanted to go home. People were squeezed in like sardines, flags were waving in front of the building, and military music was playing urgently. The so-called big sale has never been related to me, but I like to join in the fun. Usually, when I have nothing to do, I am used to strolling around the company. Perhaps this is my philosophy of "better than nothing." Naturally, I should take a trip there.</p>
<p>This is a bit embarrassing. "Running around the company" (suddenly thought) is first running around, flipping through things, and ultimately unable to withstand the employees' disdainful eyes. But I already have considerable experience! ! In addition to flipping through things, I always have to ask about their prices, even though I always "shake my head to end it," it can also show that I have a "want to buy" wish, the wish is so abstract, others can hardly see, only I understand.</p>
<p>When I strolled to the stationery section on the third floor, I bought a small notebook for four cents, so I was also holding a package of goods in my palm. Strolling again, it seemed much more imposing. When walking downstairs, oh, this is really God knows, the spacious cement staircase, people are squeezed like a box of needles, there is simply no room to insert your feet. Seeing that the situation is completely different, the eyes of the public are like hungry eagles, and they are whispering. I have always been indifferent to this situation. The old temper is still there, squeezing to the counter on the second floor, this is when I discovered the secret.</p>
<p>"Look, movie star Chen XX is also here for the big sale!" This seemed to be said by a clerk, the tone was unusually rude, I just explored as much as possible with my eyes, and sure enough, Chen XX was standing in the crowd in front, and even more found that the eyes of the public were all focused on her, the situation was quite tense.</p>
<p>I am very ashamed. I am busy with life all year round, and I only go to the cinema once or twice. However, I also have considerable attention and considerable knowledge of the stars. There are star photos hanging on the wall of my desk, and I also bought a book of phopographs and pasted several star photos that I "yearn for" on weekdays. This is also because of my old temper. I always express my goodwill to girls.</p>
<p>Speaking of Chen XX, although she is not a movie queen, I express considerable goodwill to her. She is an innocent star, and the not-so-big black mole on the corner of her cherry lips often makes me feel "the beauty of imperfection." In the movie, I watched a movie starring her more than half a year ago. Although the character is so innocent and delicate, she is a protagonist who is good at acting in tragic films. You can see it clearly from that movie. I don't know how much sour tears people shed.</p>
<p>As for the real person, she is not necessarily so innocent. She is still as ethereal as she is in the movie, no, even more ethereal than in the movie, in my opinion. This may be influenced by the lover (I assert that it is her lover) and an old woman next to her. Here, she shows a poet's face, with light makeup and light steps, calm and dignified. This is my evaluation after seeing her. Her figure is also fatter than in the movie, no, she is simply a "big head," and the richness and smoothness of her muscles really make people that.</p>
<p>"Oh! She is a movie star after all! She is Chen XX after all!"</p>
<p>I shouted these two sentences in succession, and suddenly everyone squeezed out the door, it turned out that it was already seven o'clock, and the company was about to close. I squeezed out the door, and dusk had shrouded the tempting Nanjing Road. I took the tram home under the neon lights.</p>
<h3 id="e29">People Wandering on the Street <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Tiredness and hunger made Afu unable to sleep for a moment. He stretched his neck, revealing his pair of lifeless eyes, looking at the dark street.</p>
<p>During the day, hundreds and thousands of people walk on this street, but in this late night, it is as quiet as death. There is not a single figure in the darkness. The kerosene lamps in the middle of the road are hung very far away, and their light is dim and faint. The flames are blown up and down by the wind, sometimes bright and sometimes dark, looking like the will-o'-the-wisps on the grave. Darkness and silence occupy the streets late at night.</p>
<p>Afu tiptoed up from under the dark shop porch, rubbed his tired and hungry eyes, and walked step by step on the street. However, hunger made him lose the strength to walk. His legs seemed to weigh a thousand pounds. He barely ran a few dozen steps, and could no longer support it. A burst of darkness in front of him, and he lay down under the shop porch of another store.</p>
<p>He had not eaten for two whole days. At this time, although he felt excessively tired, the hunger in his stomach made him have to squint his eyes, lying on the cement of the shop porch, panting and dazed.</p>
<p>The crowing of chickens in the distance has already reached this silent street, and a little white has appeared in the corner of the sky at the end of the street. Gradually, there are sounds of people walking on the street. The mournful cries of pigs in the butcher shop, and the barking of dogs in the streets and alleys, are heard one after another. Dawn has already arrived in the world.</p>
<p>The shops have opened, and the street has returned to the lively world.</p>
<p>Afu is now also mixed in the crowd, walking slowly, from the front street to the back street, and from the back street to the front street. His pair of yellow hungry eyes, without turning, are all looking at the white rice in the rice shop, the steaming pots in the noodle restaurant, and his stomach is rumbling. Even the steamed buns and sesame cakes in the sesame cake shop, he thinks that being able to eat one is also happiness that is gone.</p>
<p>Finally, he stood at the door of a rice shop on the back street. He watched the people in the shop eating breakfast, and the corners of his mouth kept flowing with foam. The hunger in his stomach made him even more uncomfortable.</p>
<p>He suddenly looked at the pedestrians around him with thief's eyes, tiptoed to the back door of the rice shop, stretched his neck and looked at the window, then pushed open the door and walked in. At this time, his heart was like soybeans baking on the fire, jumping wildly, and his hands and feet were a little unsteady. "God, as long as I can be lucky this time, I will never do it again next time." He secretly blessed like this.</p>
<p>The rice, bag after bag, piled up like a mountain. Although Afu's hands were shaking, hunger oppressed him, so he exhausted all his strength, carried a large bag of rice on his shoulder, and ran out of that terrifying door.</p>
<p>"Catch the thief"</p>
<p>A cry rang out, and Afu's heart was in a panic. Originally, he was already too hungry to have any strength, and a large bag of rice was pressed on his shoulder, so his feet softened and he was caught by two pursuers.</p>
<p>"Catch him, don't let him go. The lost items on the street these days were all stolen by him."</p>
<p>"He really doesn't know how to die. He stole a bag of rice on the front street yesterday, and he's here again today."</p>
<p>People were shouting and scolding in a hubbub, and the idlers walking around also surrounded Afu. A burst of fists hit Afu's body.</p>
<p>The sun hung high in the blue sky, and its light, like nails, shot into Afu's back. He walked one step at a time, thinking:</p>
<p>"Why don't you catch me away? Where can I go to eat, and what about my wife?"</p>

<p>— Shui Rong</p>
<p>We don't have a mother.</p>
<p>It's really that we don't have a mother. We always suffer losses everywhere, and when we suffer losses, there's nowhere to complain. That feeling is like a mute eating Coptis chinensis (bitter).</p>
<p>For example: the way my younger brother's teachers and classmates treat my younger brother:</p>
<p>Those teachers said behind his back: "Bastard</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>!"</p>
<p>Those classmates said in front of him: "Bastard!"</p>
<p>Some embarrassed eyes were shooting at my younger brother, some dirty spit was shooting at my younger brother.</p>
<p>He dragged his book bag horizontally without resistance and ran back: "Brother, they all call me "Bastard!"</p>
<p>Thousands of arrows pierced my heart. Tears appeared in my eyes, and then flowed back in.</p>
<p>I reluctantly replied: "Don't pay attention to them, brother! Remember, one day they will also be bastards."</p>
<p>My younger brother cried and shouted: "Mom! Mom!" Suddenly, he asked: "Why don't I have a mother?"</p>
<p>Well, why don't we have a mother?</p>
<p>Every door is closed in front of us! Everyone's face is turned away in front of us!</p>
<p>Everyone said: "Unlucky, met a bastard!"</p>
<p>Everyone said: "Met a bastard, unlucky!"</p>
<p>Everyone said: "………………!"</p>
<p>Thousands of arrows pierced our hearts, tears appeared in our eyes, and then flowed back in.</p>
<p>Night.</p>
<p>The moon sneaked into my house, looking at me lonely, looking at my lonely shadow on the wall.</p>
<p>Sob, sob, sob—let the tears that I endured during the day flow out!—Sob, sob, sob.</p>
<p>"Why don't we have a mother?"</p>
<p>What answered me was the darkness of silence.</p>
<p>I quietly ran to my mother's room: kissing the bed my mother slept on, kissing the pillow my mother slept on…</p>
<p>"Tell me, why don't we have a mother"</p>
<p>It was the darkness of silence that answered me.</p>
<p>Sob, sob, sob—Sob, sob, sob.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I saw my mother lying on the bed: she was as thin as an Egyptian mummy. Her face was strangely dark and twitching. A thin layer of skin wrapped around her high cheekbones.………Suddenly, she bit her firewood-like arm: "Ah, let me die quickly! I've caused so many special diseases…" Then, she closed her eyes!</p>
<p>"Mom! Mom!" My younger brother's voice.</p>
<p>Mom is gone, it's my younger brother lying on this bed!</p>
<p>"Don't cry, brother! Mom will never come back. Remember: how Mom died. Mom was crushed to death by life! So young! We must never take the path she took again."</p>
<p>"I want Mom!"</p>
<p>I put a pillow next to him and let him lean on it: "Here, brother! Mom here!"</p>

<h3 id="e32">Uncle's Braid (2) <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Uncle Fengyun didn't speak, but only smoked water tobacco. The water tobacco pipe always made a buzzing sound when smoked because it was very dirty, which seemed to take a lot of effort. Shimin climbed down from the high stool at this time. As usual, when guests came, it was his chance to be lazy. In this regard, he had always had a good method: when guests came, he would read aloud with a loud voice, a sharp, piercing sound, which simply made it impossible to hear what people were saying. Then, his father couldn't help but tell him to stop for a while. Then, needless to say, he would quickly lean on his father's side from the desk, listening quietly to the guests' conversation. Sometimes, the guests only talked about things like whether the harvest was good or not, which was very boring. He even took this opportunity to run outside to play. But he didn't use this method today. He simply stopped reading as soon as he saw the guests coming.</p>
<p>Uncle Fengyun smoked several bags of tobacco in a row, and then said slowly:</p>
<p>"Then you read the Shanghai newspapers every day. Is there any news in the newspapers?"</p>
<p>"Are you talking about news about the revolutionaries?" Father said, "Of course, they don't dare to publish it. But there are often things about catching revolutionaries."</p>
<p>"But the world is bound to be in great chaos. A few days ago, I heard about dogs growing horns and chicks growing feet. Yesterday, I looked at the chickens in my house one by one, and two of them had grown feet. Later, I killed them all and ate them."</p>
<p>"Chickens growing feet? Chickens always have feet." Father thought Uncle Fengyun's words were ridiculous. But Fengyun replied:</p>
<p>"Ah, who said chickens don't have feet? What I'm talking about is that two more feet grew in the chickens' wings?"</p>
<p>"Oh! Is there such a thing? That's strange."</p>
<p>As soon as Shimin heard this, he ran to the kitchen in a strange way and shouted loudly:</p>
<p>"Aunt! Come here quickly, come and see if the chickens at home have grown two more feet in their wings?"</p>
<p>Here, Uncle Fengyun also said to the senior teacher:</p>
<p>"If there are any chickens with extra feet, kill them and eat them. It's always troublesome to keep monsters at home."</p>
<p>Soon, the sound of catching chickens was heard. Some were frightened and ran away, and some struggled pitifully in their aunt's hands. After that, the aunt caught two of them and came to the hall from the corridor, asking Uncle Fengyun:</p>
<p>"Where are the feet in the wings? There aren't any, look!"</p>
<p>"Maybe you don't have them at home, but let me take a look." He took the chicken and turned its wings to look for them, "Look, isn't this a foot? This small mole-like thing."</p>
<p>"Ah, is that it?" The aunt said, "Then every chicken has it. If you don't believe me, let's look at this one, it also has it. …Look, right? Isn't there a grain in every wing?"</p>
