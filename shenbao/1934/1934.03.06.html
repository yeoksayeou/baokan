<p>邇來頻傳豫省開封各機關。厲行黎明運動。軍政官員每日天明舉行早操一小時。操畢。復有專門學術之講授。該省主席出巡孟津。對縣長及全體公務員訓話。亦勉以振刷精神。發揚朝氣。魯省韓主席亦重下通令。提倡朝氣。慨自鼎革以還。士濫官滔。蒸爲習尙。輾轉效尤。積重難返。若兩主席者。殆抱有移風易俗之宏願。空谷足音。逈異凡響。因樂爲引申其意。</p>
<p>昔曾滌生氏嘗嘆息人欲横流廉恥道喪。自誓以不晏起不撤謊二事與僚友共勉專務躬行久而彌篤終曾氏之身。部曲從風。吏治丕變。提倡不晏起一事實與有其力</p>
<p>今日一般高唱國家社會改革論者。激昻慷慨。舖張揚厲。縱能聳動視聽於一時。而陳義太高。轉近虚僞。夫國家社會。有如機體。組織細胞。厥爲個人。細胞不健全。欲求機體發達。必無是理。救國救社會。當由救人做起。而救人之道。又應從淺近推衍。苟能看透箇中情理。抓定宗旨。躬親實踐。盡其在我。則我先得救。轉以化人。則人亦得救。所謂「窮則獨善其身。達則兼善天下。」理固一貫。卽如不晏起一事。看以困難。而實淺近。但正惟淺近。士大夫之流。能力行不渝者蓋寡。謂余不信。反證可鑒。不觀乎國内通都大邑若上海者。冶遊之風。在昔已甚。於今爲烈。環顧字内。殆鮮其儔。每當夕暉蒼茫。華燈初張。號稱體面人士乃分道揚鑣。以從事其紙迷金醉之夜生活。或則呼盧喝雉。樗蒱爲戲。或則按曲步趨。擁姬狂舞。行樂無藝。夜長苦短。迨東方乍白。晨光熹微。始闌單歸去。一枕黄梁。及晚才起。隔夜生活。重演一番。似此晨昏顚倒。陰陽易置。清明隔絶。暮氣交接。人心之腐敗。風俗之磽薄。勢所必至。理有固然。矧當農村破産。城市人口之增殖。奚止倍蓰。不良環境。貽禍更大。今且閉目懸想。除肩挑貿易小本營生不計。上海羣衆而肯黎明卽起。各盡其職守。以至父子兄弟相策勉。師友親朋相規勸。則夙稱暮氣重重之十里洋塲。將成如何局面。循是推廣而復加以在上者氣節之奬借。道德之鼓勵。期以十年至數十年。上海可救中國亦必不至於淪亡。</p>
<p>何以言「不晏起一事。正惟淺近。士大夫之流。能力行不渝者蓋寡。」間嘗思維理由凡三。一因提倡乏人。再因同道難得。三因日久生懈。夫風俗之厚薄。其先實由乎在上者存心之所嚮。蚩蚩者氓。譬諸流水。决之東則東流。决之西則西流。今國内之達官顯宦多矣。其老於世故飽嘗憂患者。更僕難數。不宴起之利益。寗不知之甚稔。顧能躬親提倡者。則不多覯。夫機關職員。固惟長官之馬首是瞻。長官弛緩。則員司寛懈。朝氣消沈。情僞斯出。偶有一二自好之士。與衆立異。同道難得。寖假亦化。今豫魯之黎明運動。經本省最高長官之提倡。因勢利導。初不甚難。但仍恐發軔伊始。半由强制。時過境遷。故態復萌。卽幸不至此。視爲畫卯報到。例行儀式貌存質亡。爲效亦僅耳。</p>
<p>然則持久之道。果何所出。曰莊子有言。哀莫大於心死而身死次之。改革之道亦莫先於革心。而革身次之假若豫魯黎明運動之進行循序。不過欲自鍜鍊體格以至於精神。或擬藉革身而漸入革心。竊恐紆迴曲折。不克一蹴而幾。或且日久弊生。前功盡棄不然。如其初衷在融冶革心與革身兩者於一爐。而執政領袖又能以身作則。爲民前驅。則始足以言表裏兼顧。上下相孚。今日國勢阽危。無以復加。我國民所仰望於各領袖者。亦遠過於曩昔。各領袖而肯盡力推廣豫魯黎明運動之意。困知勉行。正心誠意。并以事實證明爲天下表率。則我四百兆裔黄子孫於焉託命之中國。當重有揚眉吐氣顯露其崢嶸頭角之一日。</p>

<p>財政困難大造鐵路</p>
<p>（東京）　貴族院本會議五日上午十時開會、前任鐵道省次官之青木周三、對於三土鐵相質問鐵道建設法改正問題、其大意謂、政府於現在財政非常時際、停止已經開工之鐵道建設、另外開始八條鐵路之工事、其内幕似有綱紀問題之疑惑、議塲因青木提起第二次綱紀問題、非常緊張、（五日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）　現内閣自議會開幕以來、僅僅三月之内、更換陸相·商相·文相·三重要人物、依照從來之例、當然立卽掛冠、然現政府企圖通過議會後、由政友會補充閣員、力謀延命之策、政友會最近對政府之態度緩和、故關於政府前途抱如次樂觀意見、政友會於將來由政府接到補充閣員之交涉時、擬以好意應其請求、且民政黨已無積極倒閣之意、衆議院對政府空氣决不致惡化、貴族院雖以綱紀問題反對政府、然因無適當人物担任次期政權、未必有貴族院全體進行倒閣運動之事、政府補任閣員後、可以存續至五六月亦未可知、（五日日聯電）</p>

<p>青木於是轉向其辭鋒於綱紀問題曰、政府如有計劃被國民疑惑、則應在議會堂堂否認其事、俾國民諒解眞相、余之質問、對於政府與以此釋明之機會也、三士鐵相就任鐵相後、積極進行建設計劃、然觀察本年之計劃、確有令人疑惑之點、卽本年新計劃以二千四百萬圓經費建設八條鐵路、今在財政非常之時局、豈有發行如此巨大公債實行建築之必要、</p>
<p>青木其次關於各鐵路加以詳細檢討後續言謂、</p>
<p>由此觀之、可知各鐵路均被黨制黨略所利用、本法案雖不致通過會議、國家　　决不因此受損失、</p>
<p>三土鐵相答辯謂、</p>

得胖長得瘦，你自己拿相片去瞧瞧就知道了。田青道：没有信嗎？自强道：没有信，大概是怕我偷着拆開來吧？其實也不必瞧信，你想想他心眼裏該要說些什麽話呢？田青歎了一口氣道：爲人莫當兵，當兵莫訂婚。他說完了這話，兩手插在操衣褲袋裏，長長的歎了一口氣，還肜脚顚了兩顚。（三二八）美容的秘訣  冰玉　　（一）蒼顔變爲血色法面容蒼白的人，大概因爲血液的循環不好，所以皮膚也受連帶的關係，變爲貧血的樣子。這類的人應當多吃些青菜與多運動。但是局部的治療法，調理得適當，也可以改換面目的。其法；用紹興酒（稀薄燒酒亦可以代）裝在瓶内，放入去皮的萍果，隔了三天，再放些蕎麥，過了三四天，用紗布濾過，把藥水棉花浸這透明的液，每天在面上搽擦數次，那面色就可以漸漸變爲血色的。西洋的婦女常用萍果酸擦面，或專用萍果磨面後，再用加里肥皂洗滌，能够把蒼白色褪去，就是與這法相同的。　　（二）肌理細艶法　每天在未修飾以前，先用紙浸冷水，不可過濕，輕輕絞過，搽在面部，使皮膚遇冷收縮，再塗上胡瓜的水或絲瓜的水，（植物性化妝水製法用新鮮胡瓜絲瓜切碎，裹在綢布内絞出，等到澄清，滴在乎心擦面）　末，肌膚不會粗糙，而且肌理也能變爲細嫩柔滑的。　　（三）油光面紅潤法大凡面帶油光的人，因爲脂肪性者過多的緣故，每日可用無脂肪性的化妝水摩擦，使肌理漸漸伸張皮膚的組織，得到柔軟的刺激，那油光就會退去，其法，先用毛由浸熱水潤面，再用萍果露加蜂蜜數滴，滴在掌心搽擦，等其乾燥，再用礬石（藥房中均有）浸水，輕輕在面部磨擦一次，那皮膚就會紅潤了。　　（四）多汗性顔的治法汗性很多的面，先用萍果酸洗滌，再用明礬二分，天化粉三分，滑石五分，每晨搽擦一次，自然會收汗的。　　（五）消滅面上皺紋法年輕婦女的皮膚組織，都是結實緊密的，假使面上生皺紋，先用冷水洗希，刺激皮膚，再用粗布摩擦，到了面部紅熱爲止，那末可防皺紋發生，如已現皺紋的部分，再用牛奶和蜂蜜搽擦，那可以使弛張的皮膚，漸漸緊密的。　　（六）枯燥紫黑白嫩法顔面紫黑，因爲血液循環不順的緣故，假使　服亞砒霜丸，就可以變爲白嫩，（亞砒霜丸著名藥店都有買的）服法第一天每次先服三粒，第二天增加四粒，第三天五粒，第四天又减少粒數爲四粒，第五天三粒，如是遞减遞增的循環服了了個月，就可見效，不過服亞砒霜丸期間，絶對不可飮茶，這是余實騐所得，眞正可靠的。　　（七）嘴唇粗糙紅潤法嘴唇粗糙，發生皺裂，西洋婦女最爲羞惡，因爲社交上接吻的時候，足使對方不歡，（俗語口似剉刀）現在迎合婦女心理的美容家，悉心研究，製出了什麽潤唇膏，什麽養唇漿，名目雖多，但是都不出乎下面幾種原料，普通所用的，可把滑石一·○雷沙爾丁二·○阿刺比亞戈姆五·○蒸溜水五·○配合起來，每次洗面後，搽擦一次，就會紅潤的。　　（八）豆腐嫩肌法這是鄉下婦女經濟的化妝法，每天早晨用嫩豆腐一塊，加些萍果皮（搗碎）放在掌中，摩擦面部，過了一個月，肌膚就會白嫩起來的。如爲經濟起見，最好用冷水洗面，再用粗布磨擦，使血色透出，旣然不費分文，而且非常簡單，收效尢爲快速。以上所據各種方法，都是實騐而得，並非胡言亂語，請讀者不坊試騐一下，就可以判别效果的。</p>

<p>自由談	回到古代去  克　　中國恐怕也眞是老大的民族，守舊精神畢竟特别地久長。歐風據說東漸了，「禦侮」起來却仍舊打赤膊，拿大刀。在文學上，連有些可說是新時代的新青年，也在指導大約並非新時代的青年們，趕快讀綫裝書，回到古代去尋做文章的師父。談到美術，那更是非常古怪的。　　我們早先的文人，除了看花，賞月，嫖妓之外，是還要塗得幾筆山水人物如王摩詰之流的，才算齊全，高雅。所以早先的美術家，大抵也是文學家兼做。現在的文人却不然了；雖說嫖妓之類有些不但仍然喜歡，而且似乎進了步，但對於那繪事，是不大有人理會的，這原因，大半是以爲没有前者那麽易學，舒服，倒並非革了什麽命。但是，那祖傳的美術，存在却依然存在着，不過大半竟已經到了慈善家，商業家之流的手中，做了交易塲上的應酬品。而他們也就因此兼做美術家，成爲高雅的名士了。他們的畫，不是一個和尙在山上觀瀑布，便是一個隱士在樹下彈琴，大抵寛袍大袖，飄飄然都像神仙的。他們評作品的標凖，是以你所抄襲的東西像那一朝人的作風而定，凡是最古的，就最好，最有價値。總之，是也要趕快回到古代去，都做古人去。　　最奇的，是近來竟有人於所謂「國難期中」，閒情逸致地，將中國這樣的古董搬到外國開展覽會去了。據說這不但是「搆通中歐文化」，而且在促成「東風歐漸」。因爲「中國的繪畫，自三代以至現在，已歷四千餘年的歷史」，故「卓然在世界藝苑獨樹特幟，而領有東方全域」。德國敎育部長茹斯特不是說「我們很淺薄很漸愧，我們應該十二分虚懷去看中國畫」麽？這實在很像於中國有莫大的光榮。但是，中國恐怕因此要變成歐洲考古學家研究的古希臘，古羅馬了。希臘羅馬在文化史上的地位誠然不差，但現在早並領土也送給别人了。　　「日本的文化實由中國輸入」，但日本現在的美術並非中國古代的東西，從這裏，我們大概不難明白日本之所以成爲世界的强國，中國之所以成爲「次殖民地」的原因吧。　　不過，一定有人要質問：「西洋畫」不也輸入中國了麽？關於這，只要看過許多自命爲新「藝術家」所畫的什麽「印象派」之類，就可知其實並非現在歐洲時髦的東西；何况又有人在畫佛像，畫古代的美人，要添上「東方色彩」了呢！　　中國恐怕也眞是老大的民族！威尼斯給我的見面禮物  馬宗融　　意大利的威尼斯，就是莎士比亞名劇「一磅肉」借爲背景的地方，只要有人提起，不管是去過或没有去過的，都會同聲贊揚。的確，這是個玲瓏精巧極盡天工人力的一個很特色的小城。你且看「英國文學史」及「藝術哲學」的作者，法國大哲學家，大批評家戴納，一見着牠時是怎樣地驚嘆：　　「威尼斯是意大利的珍珠……當我們觀賞着這些大理石的宫邸，大理石的橋，大理石的敎堂，這些如繡如繪的壯麗的柱，露臺，窗，戈底克式，摩爾式，碧攘頂式的牆額以及到處都是的活動而光澤的水時，我們就自問爲什麽不立刻到這裏來，爲什麽把兩個月的時光白費在别的城裏，爲什麽不把所有的時間都來消磨在這威尼斯。我們打算住下來的計劃，我們發誓以後還要再來；是第一回罷，我們不僅用智慧，却是用心，各種感官，整個的人格去欣賞。我們自覺已凖學着去享福了，感着生活是美麗而舒適。我們只須睜着眼睛，用不着動；「公多爾」（遊艇）前進的動作使人毫不感覺；於是身心俱曠。一點潤而且和的風吹上臉來。看見運河的水面上搖閃着褪紅或慘白色的宫邸的形影沉睡在那黎明的清凉和寂靜中」。　　他把這威尼斯說得何等美麗，我們直可看見他的靈魂的顫動和跳躍。不止是他，凡是詩人到了那裏，就有一番吟詠；凡是藝術家到了那裏，就有幾張畫圖。英國的藝術批評家拉斯金寫了一部三大厚册的「威尼斯的石」，把威尼斯的一柱一石都詳加考覈與批評，全書充滿着他對這秀美的小城的熱愛和詩意。　　可是我眞不幸，偏逢着與他人絶不相同的遭遇。　　我在羅馬的九個月中把威尼斯的如何如何已聽得飽了，趁再返巴黎之便，就和一個意大利的朋友相約到那裏去盤還兩天：他先到威尼斯附近一個鄉村裏他的親戚處去等我，因爲我們須得先在這鄉村裏去小住三五日。到啓行的一天，我隨身的行李太多，不能直接往鄉村，便先到威尼斯去寄頓行李，又因爲在布洛尼亞看一個朋友躭擱了，半夜方才到得威尼斯。當出車站時，一羣遊覽指導人和旅店接客者和蜂一般地撲到我的面前：我認此輩最能敗人的遊興，又且在遊拉波里及朋白驛時曾吃了他們的大虧，故卽趕緊迴避，仗着老於旅行的經騐，打算一切都自己來幹。　　頃刻的熱鬧寂息了，我出到街上一看，河裏的船是早没有了，只有水光與夜色相映；行人稀少，橋那邊只有右面的燈光還盛；我急急的踱過橋，向右邊燈光多處走去，找着一個還相當大的旅館一問：「客滿！」再連問幾家較大和較小的客店，都得着一樣的回答：「客滿！」　　無奈只好回頭向橋左走去，那裏黑暗中排列着幾家小棧房，我就擇了一家較清潔的去敲門，承他盛情的接待，我化了十幾個「里爾」（意幣）得到一間房子：天花板用手可以摸着，床的兩頭没有多少間隙，床與其對面的壁間僅有一鞠躬之地，窗小，門低，在一個歐洲南方六月中旬的天氣，你想想是什麽味兒！我的窗是不能不開了，那從河裏吹來的一股股的爛泥和魚腥氣味眞使人至今想來還要發嘔。但是倦極了！還是睡罷！任你怎樣也睡不着。爲什麽緣故呢？身上不是這裏蘇蘇地癢，便是那裏辣辣地疼。怎的！……怎的！把爬搔着的手抽回來送到鼻尖一聞：哇！夥頤！不好，臭蟲啊！　　於是起身把燈開了一看：枕頭底下幾個散着的忙忙奔走，很像羊衞哨探，床邊和布縫中却是大隊，或已列陣以待，或正魚貫前進！這怎麽敢再睡，只得把窗子關上，站在房的當中，把一身脫光，遍身拦掃，只覺到處蘇癢，像臭蟲在滿身爬行樣。好在是熱天，衣服容易檢查，穿好了再把皮夾子也細細搜看一過，開了房門，店東也顧不得告别，一溜烟就逃進了車站，去等次早第一班車往鄉村。我在車站裏和一個守衞警察作了個通侂的，我生平僅有過一次的用意大利話的長談！　　我於此得到一個敎訓：在無論什麽美麗的遮蓋底下都自有牠的醜惡，只是你没有機會發見。雜談幽默（續）  徐懋庸　　以上各條，在幽默是使人發笑的這一點上，雖然一致，但德哥勃拉以爲幽默並不是專門使人發笑的東西，他說：「我們不要以爲幽默家的任務是一味顽皮，倘把幽默家作如是觀，那是太蔑視了幽默的眞價。」他又說：「有的幽默是很傷心的，牠雖然引起人們的笑，但是只差一點，牠就會使人流涙的。」　　眞正的快樂使人盡情地笑，分明的悲苦使人盡情地哭，在這樣的事情上不會發生幽默，人們一盡情，也無從發生幽默。但是世間有許多事情，往往竟使你不辨哀樂，啼笑俱非。譬如古時希臘的一個哲學家Ｄemocrite對於一般人類的愚蠢常覺好笑，而另一個哲學家Ｈeraclite却對此常常哭泣，像這樣可笑也可泣的事情，有的把牠化得可笑，同時也使笑者不自覺地流出眼涙。這一種就是所謂傷心的幽默罷。Taine所說的幽默就是這一種，他說：「幽默是板着臉孔說笑話的人所說的笑話，是一種又苦又辣又澀的東西，這種東西，産於北方的陰冷的天空底下，只適合於日耳曼人的脾胃，猶如大麥酒之適合於他們的味覺」。　　但這到底是幽默的旁支。若論正宗，自然要推風韻無窮使人發「會心的微笑」，且能以一言半語，排難解紛的那一類，如廚川白村所說：「雖在議論天下國家的大事，當危急存亡之際，極其嚴肅的緊張了的心情的時候，……有了什麽質問之類，漸漸地煩難起來了的時候，就用這幽默一下子打通，互相爭辯着的人們，立刻又破顔微笑。一是這樣的幽默。然而廚川氏又說，這是盎格羅撒克遜人種的特色，在日本人中是全然看不見的。　　在中國，林語堂先生所提倡的，就是盎格羅撒克遜式的幽默。林先生自己說過，「幽默並非一味荒唐，旣没有道學氣味，也没有小丑氣味。」但據我看來，林先生自己的許多文章，其實很富於道學氣味，這是因爲林先生太想以幽默調濟世道人心，如想由論語呌武人政客少打欺僞的通電宣言之故。因爲存着這樣的心，故不免語重心長，把適可而止就很幽默的話，說得盡情了一點，遂增加道學氣味了。至於其他中國的幽默作家，我看都帶些小丑氣味，和林先生又兩樣。　　大概中國也是不能有盎格羅撒克遜式的幽默的，因爲没有盎格羅撒克遜人那樣的環境和遺傳。補遺　　昨日本刋所登岳萌先生「南國的小嶼」一文，末尾脫去一段，茲特補載於此。　　記者　　女客中最多而且最惹眼的，大約要算是印度彭遮普省的人了。她們並不怎樣棕黑，倒全是淡黄的，看着她們的臉，便不知不覺地聯想到中國廟裏塑的觀音。所不同的，是鼻子上吊着好些精巧的金屬圈子，而且多到直遮掩着了嘴巴，我常常疑慮，不知她們是怎樣地吃東西。手上足上也帶着許許多多金屬的飾物，一動身，便響丁響當地，走起路來，極不便利。她們是適宜於坐在故鄉屋前，菩提樹下，領領小孩，或是紡紡甘地那樣紡着的棉花車的。如今却跟同男子遠來異國謀生了，那飽浸酸苦的心情，是不難從她們的眼裏偷瞧出的。　　其餘則全是曼德拉斯來的南印度人，這小嶼上的世界，簡直可以說是他們的。而且一切的設備，也像專爲他們而設的一樣。例如男女厠所的分别，不用文字來標識，只在門口畫上又矮又黑的男女就够了，因爲南印度人就通是這麽樣的。而裏面的雜役，除了一個中國的廣東人外也俱係南印度人·這是取其語言相同便於招呼的原故。至於那個廣東人之所以能够做工，也還是由於他　一些Tamil方言。（南印度曼德拉斯省人講此種方言，）南印主人要的工資，比一般中國工人還要低微些，這是以後在馬來聯邦的火車上聽來的，如果是不錯的話，那末，大量地歡迎着他們的到來，是並不是漫無計劃的了。没有雪（四）  繆崇羣　　北京城也是這幾天才熱鬧起來的，兩三個月以前絶不曾這樣過，那時或許因爲故宫的寳物還没有走；鎭壓一個地方是需要寳物的。那時，將軍也没有走，將軍府的傳信摩托脚踏車天天在大街小巷裏跑着，車旁還有一個袴斗子，大都是空着不坐人，（也許儘裝着機要的公文）嘟嘟丨丨嘟嘟丨丨地馬力開得非常快，像疾風暴雨，撞死了人不償命，因爲是傳信的摩托脚踏車，將軍府的。　　冷清的城圈裏只聽見將軍府裏的摩托車嘟嘟嘟丨丨嘟嘟嘟丨丨　　將軍府的裏裏外外，也照樣有相當的冷清，將軍的夫人不大在府裏，不是忙着去慰勞傷兵，就是席不容煖地去籌募航空救國的捐欵。　　將軍府門外的傳信車，並不在將軍府門外嘟嘟嘟，一輛，兩輛，三輛，排得非常嚴肅，二道門外是停着普通的汽車，一二五八，二七六零，九一四一……有參議的，有局長的，有哲學博士的……　　將軍府的客廳裏鎭日地繚繞着雪茄的青青色的烟紋，在烟紋裏坐滿了如雨的說客和謀士。從繡墩到沙發，從沙發到繡墩，慢慢地踱着，慢慢地想着家國大事……　　壁間有字，是趙孟頽的眞蹟；壁間有畫，是唐伯虎的親筆。几上有瓶：案頭有甕；都是眞的，没有一樣是可以從琉璃廠的古玩舖裏買得到的……　　在將軍府的客廳裏常常引人想到古來的話：　　「嗚呼！多難興邦，殷憂啓聖。」…………………………………　　有那麽一夜，一夜直到天亮，將軍府裏的脚踏摩托車在九城裏不止的響着，一會兒嘟嘟地過去了，一會兒嘟嘟地回來了，又不只一輛，像是一齊動員了。　　嘟嘟嘟嘟嘟嘟嘟嘟嘟　　溜溜響到天亮，夜仿彿是沸騰了而且爛熟了。　　第二天早晨，街上　洗了一過似的冷清。没有汽車，馬車，人力車，排子車，水車……没有人；連駱駝也没有了。　　報紙到下午才送來。　　「前方吃緊，熱河不守。」　　這消息是不意地傳來了。　　將軍統率的幾十萬大兵，　潮水般地退了下來，萬里長城也擋不住他們，可是他們却想把住幾個殘缺的城垜和所謂天險的關口來阻擋敵人。　　有數的幾輛軍用汽車，還不够搬運那些逃將們的家私，画趟，兩趟……像飛也似地奔馳。在軍用的載重汽車上，載着大皮箱，保險櫃；載着姨太太們的細軟，金銀首飾，珠寳玉器…………近的東交民巷，遠的天津租界，都被這些貴重東西漲滿了。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言傀儡戲的演出和内幕  雅非　　醖釀已久的一幕滑稽傀儡戲；終於三月一日在日人陰謀指揮之下袍笏登塲了。當時這位劉阿斗還不如的小溥儀，一任日人之擺佈，居然沐猴而冠的僭號稱起帝來，日人則瘋狂般的到處慶祝，製造民意，意圖蒙蔽列强。那些賣國求榮的漢奸；亦狼狽爲奸的相鷹附和，他們全不見朝鮮之前車！　　此次日人之重行扮演這一幕傀儡戲，原有二大緣故：（一）爲民心不服，日人自把滿洲硬生生的同中國分離後，民衆們對於日人不但没有好感，而且仇視日深，並無脫離中國之意。他們爲收買民心起見，所以不得不再來這一着。（二）爲緩和國際空氣，和試探列强各國之態度，因爲日人之製造「滿洲國」已爲各國所反對，向各國疎通要求承認亦不得要領。於是他們祇好再來搬演一次滑稽的把戲了。　　這傀儡戲的内幕：由日人所包辦是無可諱言的事實。也可說是，他們併吞滿洲三部曲中的一段。你們不見嗎？甲午之役，日本强逼吾國訂立馬關條約，製造朝鮮獨立，不是用同樣的方式麽？現在朝鮮已是日本的了。恐怕將來滿洲不是第二個朝鮮！本來，日之欲謀滿，早已處心積慮得好久了。所以他們也曾說過，滿洲是日本的生命綫，無論如何也不肯放棄的。現在滿洲在表面上雖由溥儀主持，其實他不過是一個牽線木人頭，一切都在日人指揮之下。軍政各方面之重要權位，均爲日人所操縱，東北三千萬民衆，亦都在日人淫威鐵蹄之下呻吟着。他們雖恨日人刺骨，然亦無力反抗，甚至連哼一聲都不敢，祇得任其蹂躪而已。　　講到最近的東北，所有一切經濟，軍事，政治，皆由日本官吏所統制外，苛稅雜捐，重重壓迫，一鷄一犬都要登記，地畝之清丈，人口之調查，可謂無微不至。將來一旦發生事端，他們就可以依照預定計劃實施第三步工作了。溥儀之被棄，各漢奸的末日將臨，亦自在意中，到了那時才明白當時的失策；然而，這時滿洲已非中國之滿洲，亦非滿洲之滿洲，而已爲日本之滿洲了。大錯鑄成，悔亦奚及！　　否認反對又有什麽用呢；大好河山已非當年顔色，白山黑水盡爲志士血跡！凡是中國的人民，都應諸放聲一哭！　　溥儀僭位之日，日皇送溥儀屏風一座，作爲賀禮。這是什麽意思，大概他凖備呌溥儀躱在屏風背後，屏息着，好讓日本明目張胆的來割取滿蒙，這是一個很好的暗示。　　照目前的情勢觀察：各國都在劍拔弩張，儘量擴大軍備。尤其是俄國同日本兩國，形勢日趨嚴重，早晚　有接觸的危險，一九三六年的一戰，是所難免的。不過，吾全國人　始終像在睡夢中一般，有些什麽表示没有。不　内戰則彼仆此起，正在相繼蔓延　他們何嘗念　將來的國　小　　　　　　　　　　零零劇社首次公演觀後  凌鶴　　在無名劇人恊會第二次公演之後，我們又看到了零零劇社的公演。這一次一共是硏個獨幕劇：「劊子手」·「白茶」與「吼」。　　這三個劇對於我們都很熟悉。「劊子手」是寫一個劊子手在殘酷的生活中一種人道主義的自覺。他殺人，他以殺人爲生活，雖然他是「服從上司的命令」，雖然他不過是替統治者殺人，但是他却在殺了無數的人頭之後，他手軟了，一個人頭殺了七刀才下來，這是多麽可怕多麽慘酷的行爲啊！然而他爲了奶奶的病，爲了没有錢交房租，爲了一家人的生活，不管他是否看見了無數的寃魂寃鬼在包圍着他，在找不着任何職業的時候，他還得以殺人爲生活。　　在這年頭，殺人者將人民的生命爲兒戲，被殺者成千成萬的死於莫須有的罪名之下，我們看了這一獨幕劇，我們立刻從親戚朋友之間浮起了血的記憶。活埋，絞刑，槍斃，……一切慘無人道的殘酷的死刑。有多少純良無辜的青年，就死在這可怕的暴行之中。毒氣砲，炸彈，機關槍，火燒，血洗，……更可怕的更大規模的屠殺，仍在全中國普遍的繼續着。啊！這是何等野蠻的時代。那末要到什麽時候才會清平呢？除非殺人者被殺盡；我們盼望着未來的光明。丨　看了「劊子手」之後，我深深的如此感覺着。　　「白茶」是一羣大學生在没落期中的素描。這是外國譯本。劇作者在這裏不僅寫到他們羅漫蒂克的生活，他們兩天没有飯吃，没有錢付宿費，而且没有錢買茶葉；同時也寫到他們有的懷着高超的理想，有的却認定麵包比理想還要重要。然而他們對社會對人類富於同情，他們想爲可憐的舞女改善生活，他們想以自己的破汗衫敎女裁縫學徒補綴以脫離他們師傅的壓迫，但是他們却無能爲力，而且他們一方面想援助舞女，同時又欺侮舞女，雖然並非出於惡意，但是良心上却受着自己的懲罰。這一個劇，對於小資産階級的知識份子的意識的矛盾，可謂暴露無遺，然而究竟還没有指出他們共同的出路，舊寫實主義者常是如此。　　「吼」是一羣被壓迫的農奴們對於王者的反叛，一個頗有力量的羣衆劇。王者自信爲至高無上，而王之侍從更稱頌他是萬王之王，於是他佔有了人們的一切之後，更妒嫉農奴們的愛情，而將他們捉來處罰。但是他却聽着反抗着者而恐怖，他在没有方法制止他們的吼聲之後，他到底被反抗者顚覆了王位，在地底下發生了紅光之前，他究竟死於羣衆的威力之下。　　以上三劇，在任何方面，都有相當的時代意義。一個劇社，在第一次公演中便是如此鮮明的把握時代，使我們對它懷着極大的希望。　　以下再就演出方面略抒己見。　　「劊子手」由　　鶴　表演的賣力　　　　　好做工」　　片　　　可　　它給與觀衆的刺戟不少。整個的說，這個劇的演出，並不如何成功。我們不妨嚴格的指出一些，希望本劇的諸君有以改善。　　第一，我以爲劇中劊子手的扮裝，的確是應該誇張以給與觀衆比較鮮明的認識。然而是否就是如此扮裝呢？雖然我在没有好好的研究之前，不能提出具體的意義，但是我以爲像「鐵公鷄」似的紅頭巾，一穿皂鞋，究竟覺得有些使人難耐的味道。　　第二，當收房租的上塲之後，那個反派角色，確不易使人討好。這固然因爲在强烈的刺戟之後，觀衆很難於接受那沉悶的空氣，而收房租的因爲不敢做戲，於是乎，在極低的說白之中，使這劇因之失敗了。在二劊子手飮酒時，都還可以。最後，一個是賣力做戲，而收房租的却不够。這塲合固然使人痛快，可是舞台的嚴肅，却完全失敗。當時，台下不是一片笑聲嗎？假使好的話，應當使觀衆戰慄而不敢呼吸的。　　不過，一般的說，還可以，至少魏鶴齡是演得很好的。然而第二個劇「白茶」，脚完全失敗，我簡直疑心它是没有排演假使如此以舞台爲兒戲，或是相信自巳的天才而輕易從事，那末的失敗，應當是他們良心的懲罰。　　最後我要說到的便是「吼」了。　　這是一齣很好的戲，也是三個戲中最有成績的一個。不消說，每一個觀衆都給它興奮了。假使這一劇能排在第二個節目，不在「白茶」時趕走了許多觀衆之後，那我想它一定能够得更大的效果　　當然，因着設備的不完美，和排演還不够純熟，然而在因陋就動簡的情形之下，有如此成績，不能不使人滿意。　　我們再看本劇的演出者是何等努力。没有更好的王座，雖以四條紅黄布條也得盡可能表演出王座的尊嚴。無論獨作，燈光，效果都使人相當滿意。特别是當奴隸們口中喊出了「這紅光是從地下來的」，那時燈光和人物的位置，都充分展開了戲劇的效能。　　因篇幅，不能再說下去。但是我對於每一個演員諸君，有一個最懇切的忠告，我希望他們能够經常練習發音。這不是有些人字音咬得不正確，而發音不洪亮，完全是家常談話似的，到底不是好現象。我想舞台上的台詞，假使和電影中的說白一樣，不是極大的失敗麽。其中有希望的演員很多，但不想一一指出。業餘信箱出身低微家無恒産　　編者先生：　　現在我有一件不能解决的事情，煩勞先生在百忙中，偷閒替我解决，未知可能允諾否？倘蒙先生不棄，請將解答案在報上公布，或希將我醜陋的文字，賜一小小的篇幅，在貴刋登出，使一般情形與我類似的青年，都能受着先生好的指導，同時也能感着　先生的大　，先生是大　大悲，諒　無論如何，都要替我解决，决不肯使我失望的吧！　　在我們同胞腦海中，有一個决不能忘記的日子丨丨一二八，那天鄉下的同胞，都紛紛逃避到上海來，我的表親也是其中的一個。他們到了上海之後，我替代他們找尋房屋，請他們搬進去，並且常常去照料。我的表妹生得很美麗，在長久的時間過程中，我們竟發生了敬愛心，先生，這並非是我引誘她，也不是她引誘我，大家都是出於自己心願的，後來我們竟效倣昔日方卿陳彩娥故事，私下定了終身。這事情日久就洩露出去，外面人就都知道了，他的父母知悉之後，也非常表同情，不過她的叔父却因我出身低微，家無恒産，十分反對，時常在她的父母面前煽動，說我壞話，分散我俩良好的姻緣。她的父母被他這樣一煽動，竟表示不滿意了，然却未在口頭上流露過一句話，禁止我和他們的女兒來往。至于她呢，倒並不嫌我出身低微，家無恒産，祗希望我在社會上能够自謀生計，於願已尼，所以她拿定宗旨，决不肯改戀他人。她的叔父恐怕日後要成事實，竟在外面極力替她找覔良好伴侣。她對於此事非常憤慨屢作反抗，然這時她的父母已置之不理，一讓她的叔父等作主。她的年齡，在法律上巳有婚姻自主權力了，不過爲着怕人家說她不孝，不肯　一意孤行。而且，她的叔父並在外宣揚我的小史，說我爲人不好，以及無産業者的痛苦等等。唉！我與他無寃無仇，不知他爲什麽要苦苦和我作對　　　我們姻緣　而况往昔我亦　恭維也，他的兒子在上海讀書，我並且非常留心照顧，他眞是一個不識好歹的東西！　　現在表妹，無論如何，不願意和我取消私定婚約，（無筆據祗有口話），但若是法律從事，又恐傷家庭感情。她父母呢，倘然依了女兒的話，恐被旁人恥笑，依了兄弟的話，又覺得對不起她和我，所以也是一無辦法，進退維谷。故勞先生替我解决，闢清她叔父的謠言，和如何解决這婚姻問題。我是萬分感謝你的。祝你萬福無量　　　　　　王再生敬上。　　答：接到王君這封來信，使編者憮然惆悵者久之，二則像王君與其表妹，愛情能够這樣純潔，堅固，大有海枯石爛，此志不渝之概，這種精神實大堪欽佩；二則因王君對於編者過分重視，希望編者能够代籌萬全之策，使編者旣自慚才淺識狹，不能副王君之望，同時又十分感謝王君的誠意。因此編者惟有竭其愚誠，對於此種問題一再思考，然而仍未想出辦法，祇有將問題的性質闡明，以供王君解决問題的參考而已。　　王君這椿「良好姻緣，」如無她的叔父來横加干涉，原是極美滿而安全的，决不會不成功的。然而一經她的叔父破壞，這椿姻緣就馬上發生波瀾，竟要絶望，他的力量眞是大啊！他爲什麽有這極大的力量呢？換句話說，他爲什麽有力量破壞你們俩的好事呢？這是不可不研究的　　爲問題全　他身上　　　　　他的破壞之所以有力量，編者認爲，這不僅是他的身份的關係，（卽他是叔父，他的話能影響到她的父母）同時是他的意見是爲一般舊社會所贊成的，換句話說，他的意見是有客觀環境做根據的。查他所持以破壞你們婚姻的最大理由，是「出身底微，家無恒産」八個字，在我們看起來，或者就在一般頭腦稍爲清晰的人們看起來，這决不是婚姻的必要條件。在號稱民主的社會下，那裏還有什麽門庭，家世的分别，人是一律平等的。至於「家無恒産」，更不成問題，祇要人能賺錢，那怕他不能生存呢？一般稍具維新思想的家長們，對於其子女擇婚的標凖，早有過「祗要人學問好，能力好，品性好，財産，門庭，地域等等是儘可不管」的宣告。在我們，則更有「婚姻的基礎雙方的愛情，其他限制是没有的」見解。然而在事實上這兩種主張均是高調，前面八個字却是婚姻基礎丨丨因爲這是能適應現社會的。前者雖是受了民主思想的陶冶，然而我們的社會封建氣味依然很濃厚，家世門庭依然爲一般所重視；後者則更非在人類没有達到經濟解放之前所能做到。現在這個年頭，不論是如何穩固的職業，都有失業的危險：而没有富親戚，闊本家的薦舉，不消說謀業是很困難的，假如學問，能力是吃飯本領，跳江尋死的就無朱湘！所以，他的叔父這一番話，這種「反對」，雖則是狗屁不通，無理取鬧，却能得到社會的擁護，偏偏能使她的　　將　　　　　　　　　　　　她如此　動，竟表示不滿意了。」她的父母之「不滿意」者，恐怕不單是怕「被他人恥笑」，實在還是感覺到「無財産的苦處」，一個人在現在要想偷生苟安於這個社會，這八個字原不是不應注意的啊！　　因此，編者認爲王君婚姻的能否成功，必須以經濟確有保障，確能養活老婆爲前提你的愛人雖有「不嫌你出身底微，家無恒産」，却也「祗希望你在社會够自謀生計」；所以這是最重要的一點，如果你經濟上確有把握，依編者猜測，結合還可說大有希望，她的父母是依然會「非常表同情」的。因爲他們之所以有人笑者，怕你們將來眞個中了他們老弟「無財産之痛苦」的預言啊！要是你能保證將來决能發達，（如俗解發財，做官，或最低限度能够不事生産坐食之類）那他們還怕旁人笑什麽呢？就是他們老弟再來煽動，也决不會再受迷惑，並可振振有詞地回答他「老弟，你不要太固執了，某人雖則出身底微，家無恒産，但現在旣非帝制時代，皇帝且没有了還要講什麽家世呢？而且，他很有志氣，很有出息，現在月入甚豐，生活無慮，更何必要靠祖上的産業？」說着一陣哈哈大笑，這樣她那位令叔還有什麽屁話好說，恐怕祗好面紅耳赤，默默而退罷！　　不過。經濟充裕固是先决問題，然而這是從你的地位着想，就「美滿婚姻」的基礎而言。若從做父母者應採取的態度說。却　　「子女的幸福」，做一個</p>
<p>Page 21</p>
<p>K&gt;　個兒的觀察，　各方面去　　，不　單計及子女結婚復的生活部問題。她的父母，以前表同情　父們者，是慶幸他們的女兒後　　良好的伴侣，而且出於「雙方自願」，將來家庭和愛必可斷言；就是後來「不滿意」者，也無非是恐怕你們將來爲難，無非恐怕他的女兒幸福消失，前途黯淡，一言以蔽之，他的父母原是極其慈愛，處處從子女的幸福上着想，他們的「不滿意」是另有苦衷，不能瞎怪的。不過這種苦衷，雖則情有可原，若因此而使女兒不嫁給她的愛人，致使她終身却抱着無限隱痛，或者發生其他更不幸事故，則不但不是爲他女兒謀幸福，反而葬送了她的一生。因此，對於她的父母，編者希望，在相當情形之下，還是不要過分重視旁人恥笑，不要過分重視到未來，不如毅然决然地一面聽從女兒的意志，讓她嫁給她的情人，一方面，更積極地爲他們經濟上謀保障。　　因此，王君的婚事，一方面固須自已努力，自己估量估量經濟條件，同時也須她的父母能够轉換態度，處置果斷。　　想對王君說的話大致已經說完，但是王君希望　者能給對與他情形　似的青年，「一好的指導」。編者雖不敢自居指導（我自己覺得我的話實不能有所指導），的　也有許多話要與忙着戀愛的青年們談談。　　譬如王君罷，假如他家財萬貫，世代簪纓，那他還會受到這種阻碍，她的叔父方將　掇他的早早成功之不暇方將把姪女婿誇示於人之不暇，那裏還會來破壞？所以編者指出「經濟」是有决定婚姻可能的·因而勸王君去充實經濟條件。但編者並非是一個純粹的拜金錢主義者，編者所要指出的是：我們社會上每個青年，在封建氣味尙濃的時代，在我們的經濟没有眞正獲得解放之前，談自由戀愛，結果，必然是會遇著許多障碍的。門庭，財産是這社會中婚姻的主要條件。因此，編者很希望他們最好能够把「求愛」的精力轉移到謀社會的解放上去，卽使不能不談愛，也要認清這點，同時不要放棄這種工作，免得專門談愛，但結果愛旣追求不到，反而使一個人變成消極，頽廢，墮落，其尤甚者竟要自殺，這又何苦來呢？　　代郵：孫用濟君鑒，有暇希來館一談。小說露露的勝利（三）  義大利Ｍ賽拉歐作景心　譯　　蘇菲亞低下了頭，没有回答。她的唇微微地顫抖着，就好像是在抑制着一種悲泣。　　「我爲我很想看見你作了情人，被愛環繞着，看見你作一個新娘。如果我們能在同一天結婚那又有多麽好！」　　「蠢話！我要作一個老處女。」　　「不，小姐，我不允許你，你這個壞東西。如果羅勃特是一個好人，他必定有一個獨身的哥哥；我這樣地希望着！」　　在這時她們的母親穿着外出服走進屋裏來。　　「你要出去麽，媽媽？」露露說。　　「是的，親愛的，我要到公證人那裏去。」　　「啊！到公證人那裏去。是一件重要的事吧。」　　「你不久就會曉得了，惱人的小姐。蘇菲亞，和我一同來。」　　「蘇菲亞也和公證人有些秘密的事？」　　「露露，什麽時候你才有些大人氣？」　　「不久就行了，媽媽；你看着吧。」</p>

<p>電影專刊關於航空影片的攝製（上）  靈鎭　　我們在以空戰作背景的影片中，時常可以看見許多飛機戰鬥等，驚險的塲面。這些驚險的塲面，不但能增加劇的緊張而且使觀衆看看也覺得非常的好看。但在拍攝這些塲面時，却另用航空電影拍攝法。那關係拍攝航空電影的一此，我想有一般人們是願意知道的。　　在美國的各大影片公司，都備有飛機塲及飛機隊，并且都養活着一些不怕死的勇士。但是最近他們漸被淘汰了，他們所能做的那些驚險的塲面，在觀衆們看着已不覺得可怕了他們所要看的是空中的驚險塲面。於是公司方面又養活了一些能生離地千尺高的天空工製造驚險塲面的不怕死的人了。　　在地上拍那火車或其他種車輛飛駛的戲時，可以把那攝影機轉動的速度運用得當。便能把那駛行的並不十分快的車子變成飛快的奔駛，更有些事實上並不非常危險的塲面，利用攝影術便能變成非常驚人的塲面。而且攝影師也並不感覺到什麽困難。拍天空電影就不然了，有的時候是在這生一架飛機上安置了攝影機去拍那一架飛機。在這一架飛機上的攝影師，他要不僅的搖動他那攝影機抦，内時還要時時刻刻的注意那被拍的飛機是不是正在鏡頭裏，更要注意天空上的光綫是不是合度。還有因了兩輛飛機都在天上飛着，攝影師不易在位置上得心應手，又因了飛機在天空上飛着是不如在地上那樣的平穩，這也會增加攝影師困難的。所以一個没有經騐的攝影師，他不會拍出很好的航空影片。　　有的時候，編劇者寫一部航空影片，他寫了許多驚險的塲面、在他是非常的便易，只要他那技生動的筆和他思想靈活的頭腦運用着，便能在紙上造成了許多驚險的航空塲面的。但當這些塲面拍成影戲時，不知要費多麽大的困難，尤其是攝影方面。有許多的航空影片，他有一個極好的情節，若再有一個好的攝影師去擔任拍攝，他能注意到影機的角度，更能把並不十分驚險的塲面，因了他拍攝的好，可變成非常的驚人。反之，有些驚險的塲面，因爲攝影師拍攝的不得法，會讓觀衆們看看覺得一點也不驚險。由此可知航空影片中的驚險塲面的造成，在攝影上確佔着很重要的部份。　　在一個攝影師還没有動手拍攝那航空塲面之前，他必定要先把拍攝的計劃决定，量好了兩個飛機的距離，這距離又要計算的非常凖確，正好是這塲面應該用的距離。然後再决定影機安置的角度，在某種情况之下，應當用那種角度去拍，拍出來之後纔能好看，這樣的决定了之後，詳細的通知放置影機的那隻飛機架駛員，在一定的時間内，按照决定了的地位與距離去佈置他的飛機，再由攝影師運用他那純熟的攝影技巧，完成了這幕航空塲面。（未完）觀衆意見觀「中國海的怒潮」後  蕭璊　　「中國海的怒潮」所採取的題材，對於我們這處於半殖民地的民衆，特别是在目前各帝國主義積極地進攻的緊急時期中，無疑是能給予深刻的印象的；可是因爲某種原因，已使本片的原形失去了，因而在意旨上好些地方給予了歪曲，同時在效果也就不能有它所原有和應有的力量了。這自然不是本片作者所應負責的，所以我們對於公映的本片的短處不但不能苛責，並且還應有相當的同情。同時觀者如能細心去觀賞仍是能看出作者的主要意旨，而得到相當深刻的感動和印象的。這點效力發生，導演者和演員們是有相當的力量的。最顯著的，如飾焦大的秦桐，飾阿菊的袁美雲，他們始終保持着那種陰鬱愁苦的面容，這對於他們所過的那種生活可說給予了充分的表現。這是很難得的；因爲在銀幕的表演是常間斷的，有時這個塲面與别個塲面的表演甚至相差很長的時間，在這樣的情形中一個演員的表演要統一，一致，是相當不易的。　　本片在技巧上也有些缺點。重要的如何蘇投水的表現太不够了；只用兩行眼涙是不足以把那樣嚴重緊張情景表現出來，使觀衆感覺到她就要自殺。還有那時照在阿菊身上的光過於强了一點，對於那時的情調不甚諧和；那時水面上的光也不像是月夜的光。此外在阿菊被救後對衆陳述她被姦的事情時，銀幕上就從小榮偷偷起床時起顯示出來，這不但有點不近情理，並且對於全劇發展也有相當損害；導演手法也未免有點拙笨。還有對於羣衆的塲面也處置得不高明，最顯著是焦大家裏的那個羣衆塲面，那時是應多麽緊張！這種效果不是靠少數的幾個人所能産生出的。還有只把羣衆安置在一個平面上，而不想法利用高低的階層，這是相當削弱表現的力量，並是損害畫面的美。影片談評評「綠影春色」  羅平　　ＡaＨusbandGo丨大上海　　一個資産階級的女子，旣有了丈夫，該不該同時還有愛人？假如已有了愛人，那麽她應該怎樣去應付這個三角關係？　　本來在近代社會，女子已經從黑暗的中世紀得到了解放，雖然這種解放是極有限的；社會已承認了女子在法律上有和男性同等的地位，雖然實際上這些還都是好聽的空話。所以，兩性的戀愛，似乎已是建築在雙方的自由意志的基礎上了。自然，一個女子，旣有了丈夫，又不能忘情於舊日的愛人；這種事是很普通的，也無從加以非議的。　　問題是，這樣構成了一個三角關係，最感覺苦痛的，自然是作繭自縛的那位了。他或她將如何解除其苦痛呢？　　陸雪爾便是内心充滿着矛盾的一個。她在丈夫面前，則示意其愛人僞裝她的女友的愛人；當她的丈夫發覺了她的秘密，她知道他是仍舊愛着她很熱烈的。　　事情很巧，她的丈夫和她的愛人很說得來，而且竟成了莫逆的朋友。　　她的愛人，也爲這個三角戀愛的綱苦痛得很，他在同查理釣魚回來後，醉熏熏的二個講得很投機，他幾次三番很苦痛地嚅嚅地想告訴查理以他的隱秘的愛。　　雖然他並没有眞的告訴查理，但是他們二個的友誼已給陸雪爾看出來了，而且終於他覺得還是犧牲他自己，成全查理與陸雪爾的愛。　　「綠影春色」是這樣的一個喜劇的結束，而劇作者更聰敏的用伊密的女兒和希畢的戀愛成功來加强了它的喜劇的氣分。　　然而，「綠影春色」究竟是没有意義的三角戀愛的把戲，并没有提起兩性關係的合理的解决。滑稽明星的「蘇聯印象」  麗人　　好萊塢有名的馬克思四兄弟之一的哈爾浦馬克思（ＨajpoMarx），不久以前，我們曾從莫斯科日報得到他赴蘇聯去表演的消息。他現在已經回到美國了。據往訪的新聞記者談他對蘇聯的印象，頗爲有趣。他說，「要是你們不害怕的話，在那兒眞是一個偉大的生活呀」。於是有人問他是否皈依了共産主義，他答得很妙。他說他對於這個並不怎樣注意，他亟亟忙着的是皈依伏特加酒（Ｖodka）和魚子醬（Ｃaviar），我們知道，馬氏是蘇聯政府歡迎去的。在政府能够招待他的客人忙着去皈依酒和菜，這番盛意可没不薄的了同時蘇聯是正忙着第二次五年計劃，能够用盛筵來招待客，他的經濟與生活也可以證明是相當的提高的了。　　「我走進俄國特别費了一點力氣」，哈爾浦說，「我被扣留在邊境的某地，據地圖上看來，地名的尾音是呌什麽斯基（ＳＫＩ），我帶着許多表演用的行頭，有三百把小刀，一束假頭髮，竪琴，汽油罐及一個汽車喇叭。　　「官員們以爲我是一個瘋子，我也想他們會把我塞進地窖裏去的，但是我們談了許久。在我簽了三十封申請書之後無論忘樣我是没有危險了，他們讓我通過」。　　「是的，先生」，哈爾浦繼着說，「俄國是特别大的一塊地方，食的東西？我的天，有時我就跋涉於魚子醬裏，伏特加的供給也滔滔不絶。但你只要伏特加就好了，那兒眞够冷啊」　　馬氏對於蘇聯的劇塲特别感到興趣，他以爲全世界的和他比起來眞不算什麽。他說，在他們公演以前有九個月的排練時間啊。　　馬氏穿上了細毛的山羊皮大𣰉，戴上了俄國皮帽，街上的孩子們都戲着呌他哀斯基摩人。這是他認爲非常有味的事情。（完）「歌名艶史」昨已拍竣  驥　　南方公司薛覺先與天一公司第二次合作之「歌名艶史」，昨已全部拍竣，該片爲薛自任導演及與其夫人唐雪卿主演，結果尙覺滿意，聞最近將送京檢查，不久當可在滬公映云。電影小說二對一（四）  泉白　　烟和酒包圍着，他們和家祿已經醉了。潔夫還勸着大家喝酒，並對羅娜作眼色。於是羅娜伏在家祿身上，呌他喝這杯酒，一定唱一個「儂心許」的曲子給他聽。家祿又咕嘟一聲把她手裏酒喝下去。羅娜於是唱着：　　「春來悄，春去也無踪，儂欲留春春已去，祗餘憔悴可憐蟲！應記取，記取偶相逢，儂心已許君知否？火熱的情懷蜜一樣的儂！流水落花君似水，無意戀飄蓬，儂心枉自空！但願君意轉，雙雙携手，惜朝華，白首樂融融！」丨丨（五乾白作歌，宣景琳唱。）　　等她唱完，大家拍手，家祿也跟着拍手。羅娜問他唱得好不好？他祇連連的點頭，有勁無力的擁抱起羅娜，不由的哈哈大笑起來。他又看到紹芬們一班摩登的女人，所以他又呌她們也來唱一個。麗雲想到了一件事，所以也主張合唱一個「及時行樂」曲，家祿維達徐健都拍手歡迎，於是她們唱：　　「愛情是甚麽？有人說是痛苦，有人說是快樂；愛情是甚麽？燃燒吧！青春的火；花香容易謝，月影已婆娑，來啊！來啊！飮一杯紅酒，唱一曲甜歌；浮生若夢，人壽幾何？且及時行樂，莫待春光老去，枉自說蹉跎！」丨丨（王乾白作歌，嚴月間朱秋痕顧梅君顧蘭君等合唱。）　　太陽光已經從東方慢慢地出來了。可是家祿這班人，有的睡在沙發上，有的睡在地板上，四周嘔吐得不堪，他們忘記了今天的比球了。　　國際足球比賽，中央足球塲老早已經人滿，華光隊代表中國出塲。比賽開始了，華光隊員個個都是宿酒未醒。球只在華光方面轉來轉去。突然全塲鼓噪起來，原來是家祿一脚踼空，球已望球門射去，幸而被一球員救出。觀台上帶病的愛華，急得汗直望下流。徐健受傷了，華光隊以十人應戰，家祿被衝倒在地上了。球已順流入網。潔夫羅娜高興得互相示意。愛華是急得嘴裏吐出血來，暈倒在地上。紹芬這時不由地良心發現，何况她本來愛維達的。她不顧一切的把愛華扶到球員休息的地方，懺悔的對球員說明了潔夫們的陰謀。球員們受了剌激，大爲感動，一致興憤起來。　　下半時的比賽，華光　因隊員的努力，記分牌上從○對一變爲一對一。全塲觀衆都狂呼着替華光打氣。在最後的三分鐘裏，維達得到一球，傳給家祿。家祿舉脚一中踢，球應聲入網。全塲立時如山崩地裂一樣。等到公證人吹笛完結比賽，記分牌上，華光隊已造成二對一的記錄。（完）</p>

<h3 id="e2">Most of Sun Dianying's Troops Concentrated Northwest of Ningcheng, Still Confronting Ma's Troops <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Fu Zhankui Goes to Dengkou to Meet Sun Dianying</p>
<p>Jin-Sui Army Advance Units Approach the Yellow River</p>
<p>Fu Zuoyi and Wang Jingguo Go to Baotou for Inspection</p>
<p>Yang Hucheng Sends Troops to Prevent Sun Dianying's Troops from Fleeing to Shaanxi</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the authorities decided to both suppress and appease in handling the Sun Dianying incident, Sun himself felt it was difficult to maintain the situation and showed signs of backing down, according to official sources. A peaceful resolution may not be impossible. Fu Zhankui is expected to arrive in Dengkou this afternoon. Sun Dianying's whereabouts are still unknown here, but it is speculated that he is near Pingluo. There are reports that Sun and Fu will meet in Dengkou. Regarding military deployments, the Jin-Sui army is currently advancing west from Huangyangmutou, with advance units approaching the banks of the Yellow River, observing the evolving situation. Because the military funds have been remitted, Fu will definitely go to Baotou with Wang Jingguo and Zhao Chengzhou for inspection today or tomorrow. If the meeting between Fu and Sun is successful, military preparations will be stopped immediately; otherwise, the Jin-Sui army will launch an attack, and the armies in northern Shaanxi will also advance northward to encircle and suppress them in one fell swoop. There has been no major contact in the vicinity of Ningxia in recent days. Most of Sun's troops are now gathered about twenty miles northwest of the provincial capital, still confronting each other. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The sub-committee publicly announced the telegrams of Ma Hongkui and Ma Bufang on the night of the 5th: (1) On the 2nd, Sun Dianying led the newly arrived 119th Division, Xie Jingtian's brigade, and special service battalion, artillery battalion, and other units, to fiercely attack our army's position in the Baliqiao area north of Ningyuan. Our army bravely resisted, engaging in fierce fighting for four hours, killing over two hundred enemy officers and soldiers, including two officers such as the special service battalion commander Du Yueyue, wounding over one hundred people, seizing over one hundred large and small firearms, five machine guns, capturing over one hundred officers and soldiers, and obtaining eight scaling ladders. (2) The enemies attacking Beita were all hand-picked by Sun, and suffered about four or five hundred casualties in successive attacks, suffering heavy losses. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A telegram from Suiyuan on the 4th stated that Sun Dianying telegraphed Fu Zhankui in Dengkou, inviting him to meet in Dengkou. After receiving the telegram, Fu departed from Linhe on the morning of the 4th to Dengkou and is expected to arrive in the evening. The outcome will only be clear after Fu and Sun meet. It is reported that Sun's subordinates also advocate that Sun leave the army and reside in Tianjin. Sun himself has indicated that as long as there is a settlement for his subordinates, his departure from the army is not a problem; if forced by military force, he will not hesitate to sacrifice anything. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A telegram from Lanzhou on the 4th stated that after Sun's army near Ningxia retreated and gathered outside the Great Wall, the two Ma armies in the city prepared to go out of the city for reorganization. Ningxia has been besieged for a long time, and there is a shortage of food and fuel. Ma Hongkui urgently telegraphed Zhu Shaoliang, requesting relief of food and fuel to alleviate the urgent need. In Lanzhou, wheat, which was worth four yuan and five jiao a few days ago, has now suddenly risen to five yuan and six or seven jiao, and rice has risen to seven or eight yuan per dou. The public is crying out in hardship, all cursing Sun Dianying for causing the war and harming the people. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Hu Jiesan, Sun Dianying's former representative stationed in Beiping, left Beiping for Suiyuan last night, heading to the front line to meet Fu Zhankui and assist in everything. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) There has been no contact near Ningyuan in recent days. Most of Sun's troops are still entrenched in the Zhengjia Youfang area about twenty miles northwest of the city, and have not launched an attack. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Pang Bingxun said that Fu Zhankui has arrived in Linhe waiting for Sun, but has not yet received a reply telegram from Sun. The meeting place will likely be in Dengkou. Fu has not yet sent a telegram to Beiping, so the details of the negotiations are unclear. In the future, the Jin-Sui army's movements will still be carried out according to the original plan. Peaceful resolution is not yet hopeless, so the Jin-Sui army is now concentrated in the Sui-Bao area awaiting orders. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Because the transportation of troops requires urgent automotive vehicles, Fu Zuoyi borrowed cars last night and transported them from Beiping to Baotou. The three regiments of the Jin army, Feng Yuxi's unit, plan to concentrate between Baotou and Sarachi ten days ago to replace Fu's army. The remaining units are advancing westward. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xu Yongchang paid a visit to Huang Fu and He Yingqin tonight to bid farewell. According to reports, he is scheduled to return to Taiyuan tonight to report to Yan Xishan on his visit to Beiping. Yan is still in his hometown of Hebian Village. Regarding the issue of handling Sun's army, the Jin-Sui army has followed the orders of the Central Government and the Military Sub-committee and moved towards the Ningxia border. The Jin-Sui army is determined to implement the intention of this place from beginning to end. He instructed Xu to convey the Beiping's handling of Sun's troops to Yan Xishan. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xi'an) In order to strengthen the defenses of northern Shaanxi and prevent Sun Dianying from fleeing to Shaanxi, Yang Hucheng specially dispatched troops to the Yan'an area of northern Shaanxi to increase military strength. (4th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Frankfurt The Exhibition of Ancient and Modern Chinese Paintings organized by the Chinese painter Xu Beihong opened at the Sterdel Museum today. The Chinese Minister Liu Chongjie and Prince Hesse (the Governor of Hesse-Nassau Province, the former Grand Duke of Hesse, and the son-in-law of the King of Italy) all participated in the opening ceremony. After the ceremony, a banquet was held, but because Sunday was a national fasting day set by the National Socialist Party, there was only one dish at the end of the seat. Liu Chongjie gave a short speech, saying that the friendly relations between China and Germany have become closer in the past 20 years, and that the national fasting system set by Germany is admirable, and he has telegraphed this to the Chinese government today.

<h3 id="e30">Dawn Movement - Court <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Recently, there have been frequent reports from various institutions in Kaifeng, Henan Province, vigorously implementing the Dawn Movement. Military and government officials hold morning exercises for one hour every day at dawn. After the exercises, there are specialized academic lectures. When the provincial chairman inspected Mengjin, he also exhorted the county magistrate and all civil servants to invigorate their spirits and promote vigor. Chairman Han of Shandong Province also issued a detailed order to promote vigor. Since the revolution, there has been a surge of unqualified scholars and officials, becoming a common practice. They emulate each other, making it difficult to reverse the trend. The two chairmen seem to have a grand vision of changing customs and habits. Their voices in the empty valley are remarkably different. Therefore, I am happy to elaborate on their meaning.</p>
<p>In the past, Zeng Disheng sighed at the rampant desires and the loss of morality. He vowed to his colleagues to encourage each other with the two principles of not rising late and not lying, dedicating himself to practicing them diligently and consistently. Throughout Zeng's life, his subordinates followed his example, and the governance underwent significant changes. Advocating not rising late was indeed effective.</p>
<p>Today, those who advocate national and social reforms often speak with passion and excitement, making grand pronouncements. Although they can stir up attention for a while, their lofty ideals are often perceived as hypocritical. A nation and society are like an organism, and its individual cells are the basic units. If the cells are unhealthy, there is no way to achieve the development of the organism. To save the nation and society, one must start by saving individuals. The way to save individuals should be derived from simple and approachable principles. If one can see through the underlying rationale, grasp the purpose, and practice it diligently, doing their best, then they will be saved first, and then they can transform others, so that others can also be saved. As the saying goes, "When poor, cultivate your own virtue; when successful, benefit all under heaven." The principle is consistent. Even something as simple as not rising late seems difficult, but it is actually quite approachable. However, precisely because it is approachable, few among the scholar-officials can consistently practice it. If you don't believe me, the evidence is clear. Look at the major cities in the country, such as Shanghai, where the culture of indulgence was already prevalent in the past, but is even more rampant now. Looking around, there are hardly any comparable places. Every day at dusk, when the lights are lit, so-called respectable people go their separate ways to engage in their decadent nightlife. Some gamble and drink, while others dance with their concubines. There is no limit to their entertainment. The night is long, but feels short. They reluctantly return home only when the east turns white and the morning light appears. They sleep deeply, only waking up in the evening, and then repeat the same lifestyle. Such reversal of day and night, the exchange of yin and yang, the separation from clarity, and the gathering of twilight, will inevitably lead to the corruption of people's hearts and the barrenness of customs. Moreover, with the bankruptcy of rural areas and the increasing population of cities, the adverse environment poses even greater harm. Now, let's close our eyes and imagine, excluding small businesses and peddlers, if the masses in Shanghai were willing to rise at dawn and perform their duties diligently, and if fathers and sons, brothers, teachers and friends encouraged and advised each other, what would the notorious "ten-mile foreign concession," known for its heavy twilight, become? If this can be promoted and encouraged by those in power with integrity and morality, and if we aim for ten to several decades, Shanghai can be saved, and China will certainly not perish.</p>
<p>Why do I say, "Something as simple as not rising late is something few among the scholar-officials can consistently practice"? I have pondered the reasons and found three: First, there is a lack of advocates; second, it is difficult to find like-minded companions; and third, laziness develops over time. The quality of customs depends on the direction of the hearts of those in power. The common people are like flowing water; if diverted to the east, it flows east; if diverted to the west, it flows west. Today, there are many high-ranking officials in the country, and countless of them are experienced and have tasted the bitterness of life. They certainly know the benefits of not rising late very well. However, few are willing to personally advocate it. Government officials naturally follow the lead of their superiors. If the superiors are lax, the subordinates will be even more lenient. Vigor declines, and hypocrisy arises. Even if there are one or two individuals who strive for self-improvement and stand out from the crowd, it is difficult to find like-minded companions, and gradually they will also assimilate. Now, the Dawn Movement in Henan and Shandong, promoted by the highest officials of the provinces, is not too difficult to initiate by taking advantage of the momentum. However, I am still afraid that it will be somewhat forced at the beginning. As time passes and circumstances change, old habits will resurface. Even if this does not happen, if it is seen as merely clocking in and reporting for duty, a mere formality with substance, the effect will be limited.</p>
<p>So, what is the way to persevere? Zhuangzi said, "The greatest sorrow is the death of the heart, followed by the death of the body." The way to reform is also to reform the heart first, and then the body. If the Dawn Movement in Henan and Shandong is carried out sequentially, merely to temper the physique to the point of invigorating the spirit, or to gradually reform the heart through reforming the body, I am afraid that it will be tortuous and will not be able to achieve success in one fell swoop, or it may even lead to problems over time and undo previous efforts. If the initial intention is to integrate the reform of the heart and the reform of the body into one, and if the ruling leaders can lead by example and be pioneers for the people, then we can truly say that we are taking care of both the inside and the outside, and that those above and below trust each other. Today, the state of the nation is in a critical situation, beyond compare. What our people expect from the leaders is far more than in the past. If the leaders are willing to do their best to promote the meaning of the Dawn Movement in Henan and Shandong, to learn diligently even when facing difficulties, to rectify their hearts and make their intentions sincere, and to demonstrate through actions as a model for the world, then the four hundred million descendants of the Yellow Emperor, to whom we entrust our lives, will one day raise their eyebrows and reveal their outstanding talents.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Today, the Japanese ambassador to Russia reported to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that Ambassador Ota met with Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, Sokolnikov, on the 2nd and lodged a strong protest regarding the incident on the 23rd of last month when a Soviet Russian plane flew over northern Korea and fired on a Japanese plane, demanding punishment for those responsible. Sokolnikov's explanation for this protest is as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the flight over Korean airspace, no report has been received. Efforts are being made to ensure that personnel stationed in the area are extremely careful. If this did happen, it may have been due to a misunderstanding. As for the incident of shooting down a Japanese plane in the Jilin area, a report has been received from the military stating that the shots were fired to alert the Japanese plane, which was arbitrarily flying over Soviet Russian airspace.</p>
<p>The Japanese ambassador to the Soviet Union continued to question that the Japanese plane was originally flying within the Manchurian territory. If the purpose was to alert the plane, blank shots would have been sufficient. What was the intention of using live ammunition? Sokolnikov replied that the Soviet Union also uses live ammunition on its western borders to attract attention. Both Japan and the Soviet Union should ensure that their officials stationed abroad are careful to avoid such situations.</p>
<p>It is reported that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is strongly advocating for adhering to the original position and not stopping until the goal is achieved. (5th, Jiji News Agency)</p>

<p>Report from the Times of London</p>
<p>(London) The Times of London reported today from Tokyo that, although the Soviet Union has increased its military strength in the Far East, experienced foreigners and Japanese observers do not believe that war between Russia and Japan is inevitable. Japan does not want to attack, and the Soviet Union cannot attack. Eastern Siberia is not worth a war. Foreign Minister Hirota is gradually becoming more moderate and is preparing to resolve outstanding issues. These outstanding issues include matters more serious than the Middle East Railway case, such as the military equipment and air force in Vladivostok. The Soviet Union's military strength can destroy major Japanese cities in a matter of hours. (5th, Reuters) Austrian Prime Minister Declares Determination to Maintain Independence</p>
<h3 id="e33">New Constitution to Be Promulgated Within the Next Week, Modeled After the Italian Corporate System to Transform Austrian Life <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Vienna - Austrian patriots held a demonstration today in Villach, Carinthia Province.</p>
<p>More than 25,000 people participated. Prime Minister Dollfuss attended and delivered a speech, stating that Austria would promulgate a new constitution next week, stipulating that Austria is a country with a corporate system and an authoritarian government. Although the new constitution cannot be fully effective immediately, it can be fully implemented after the establishment of the corporate groups. This constitution is a transitional temporary constitution toward the final stage, but the provinces will continue to govern themselves through the corporate parliamentary bodies. The recent papal encyclical "Quadragesimo Anno" will become a chapter in the new constitution. In addition, Dollfuss particularly emphasized the Christian education of young people, considering it a key point in the current government's program. Dollfuss also said that Austria was built on the Alps and the Danube River. Although Austrian culture is based on Germanic culture, it should also respect the creations of non-Germanic ancestors. Our goal is to transform our country's life, making it brand new, so that countries with larger territories can take Austria as an example. At this point, the audience applauded for a long time. Dollfuss continued to express his desire to maintain Austria's independence, saying that the government has a firm attitude towards safeguarding Austria's order and peace. The unfortunate situation in German-Austrian relations is not our fault. We have always been in a defensive position. If others can live in peace with us, they do not need to worry about our aggression. The same is true domestically. Carinthia Province was the last stronghold of the National Socialist Party. Now the government has called on 25,000 people to hold a demonstration in Villach to express support for the Prime Minister. This move is of great significance for the establishment of the authority system in Carinthia Province. After the speech at the meeting, some members of the National Socialist Party attempted to hold a counter-demonstration, but it only caused minor incidents. As a result, more than 20 people were arrested, and it quickly returned to calm. (4th, Havas)</p>

<p>Hundred Years of Enmity Erased</p>
<p>Only Need Saar to Return to Germany</p>
<p>(Berlin) German Propaganda Minister Goebbels declared to representatives of the French press that the German government's every action can be expressed to the French people as "Germany is extremely willing to bring to an end, at this time and permanently, the hundred years of bloody struggle between the two countries." Therefore, Chancellor Hitler has solemnly stated that once the Saar region formally votes to belong to Germany, there will be no other land issues between Germany and France, and this issue is easy to resolve because there are no economic relationships involved. Goebbels also explained in detail Germany's geographical relations. Germany's demand for "equality" is a matter of life and death for Germany. Goebbels also said, "Isn't it obvious that the efforts of various countries to expand their naval and air forces are directed against Germany?" Therefore, France only needs to organize its internal affairs as soon as possible, and the political problems of its neighbors will be easily solved. (4th, National Telegraph)</p>

<p>(Washington) There is some misunderstanding about America's position in future disarmament talks. European political leaders seem to believe that the American representative, based on President Roosevelt's opinion, can greatly promote a non-aggression pact as a preliminary action for disarmament. President Roosevelt and State Department officials have indicated that the United States will adopt a negative attitude in disarmament talks. President Roosevelt has reiterated that the United States will not participate in discussions that are only related to Europe. President Roosevelt made this clear in his reply to the British ambassador's note last week. (4th, National News Agency)</p>

<p>Rumored to Have Jealousy Towards Czechoslovakia</p>
<p>Budapest - According to a report from this city by the correspondent of a certain Catholic newspaper stationed in the Romanian capital, Romania has recently had the intention of withdrawing from the Little Entente, and said that Romania and Czechoslovakia have disagreements. It did not feel any dissatisfaction with the negotiations between Italy, Austria, and Hungary, so it intends to wait quietly for the development of the situation. The reporter said that Romania would rather withdraw from the Little Entente countries. On the Romanian side, it feels that since the establishment of the Little Entente, Czechoslovakia is the only country that has benefited, because it can take the opportunity to sell its industrial products to the other two countries. Moreover, the power of Foreign Minister Titulescu is gradually waning, so there may be a change of policy soon. (4th, National Telegraph)</p>

<p>Rabat, Morocco - There are still some tribes in the French Moroccan mountains that are holding out and have not been subject to the jurisdiction of the Moroccan government. However, after suppression, the pacification of the entire Moroccan territory will be completed soon. The French method of conquering Moroccan tribes is to first appease them and then use various means to disperse the rebellious tribes. However, Moroccans are inherently strong-willed, and if they surrender without a fight, they will regard it as a great shame. Therefore, in addition to political appeasement, France has had to resort to military encirclement and suppression in order to maintain the face of the Moroccan chiefs, allowing them to fight hard, but ultimately succumb when they are unable to resist. Therefore, the commander-in-chief of the French army stationed in Morocco has recently conquered several tribes. One tribal chief led 3,000 households to surrender, and another tribal chief, known for his stubbornness, has also returned with his tribe and fully accepted the amnesty conditions. The surrender of these indigenous tribes has had a great impact on the remaining unyielding tribes. It is expected that the rebellious tribes in French Morocco will be greatly reduced soon.

<h3 id="e40">Trends in Spanish Politics - Prime Minister Lerroux Tries to Save the Situation <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Serious Warning Against Disturbing Public Order</p>
<p>Nationwide Labor Strikes Brewing</p>
<p>Right-Wing Parties Inclined to Restoration</p>
<p>Madrid - Spain is now in the midst of a serious crisis. Nationwide labor strikes are brewing. Radical Party leader Lerroux formed a new cabinet yesterday, but in less than six months, Lerroux has formed a cabinet three times, and his prestige is gradually declining. This morning's newspapers did not give good reviews of Lerroux's new cabinet. In general, people expect the cabinet reshuffle to only worsen the situation. After the establishment of the new government, the first step was to resolve the dispute between construction workers and employers. Immediately after, an order was issued, instructing employers to accept the workers' conditions. This move by the government was a major victory for the workers, but whether the employers will accept it will be expressed tomorrow. The new cabinet also has another difficult problem, namely the budget案. The new budget案 must be passed on April 1, otherwise the old budget案 will remain in effect. The new Minister of Finance will probably continue the old budget案, because he strongly disagrees with the wasteful expenditure of the bureaucracy. Excessive expenditure is a major reason why the new budget案 is difficult to balance. The life of the new government now depends on the right-wing parties. The right wing seems to express sympathy for the restoration. Lerroux can only get the support of 207 seats in Congress, while the Central Party has 167 seats, the Left Wing has 99 seats, a total of 266 seats, all opposing it. Furthermore, Lerroux must make concessions to maintain the support of the right wing, but in the current state of emotional agitation, concessions seem impossible. On this day when Prime Minister Lerroux, who is celebrating his 70th birthday, is shouldering a laborious and thankless task, he may soon withdraw from the political stage, live his private life, and let the Catholic Party form a government on its own. If this happens, an even more intense internal strife than last December seems inevitable. (4th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Madrid - Spanish Prime Minister Lerroux gave a speech at a banquet celebrating his 70th birthday today, saying that he will severely punish extremists who disturb public order, regardless of their position. Any disturbances must be suppressed, even if it involves bloodshed. This afternoon, in Valladolid, a disturbance occurred during the merger ceremony of two fascist organizations. Shots were fired. In Barcelona, a tram was shot at, and one ticket seller was seriously injured and his life is in danger. (5th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Madrid - Prime Minister Lerroux delivered a speech at his birthday banquet today, instructing radical elements to unite and abide by discipline. He also said that the left-wing parties currently have very little political power. The new cabinet will be based on all sound elements, regardless of their origin, as long as they support the republican system. Finally, Lerroux advocated strictly maintaining order and asked the people to cooperate and resolve matters in order to oppose the principle of class struggle. (4th, Havas)</p>
<p>Barcelona - Today, a restoration party held a secret meeting here, which was discovered by the police, and many people were arrested. According to official reports, those arrested included several members of the Spanish Restoration Party Federation, several students, one architect, two retired majors, one reserve captain, and one active-duty lieutenant. The meeting place was in a certain restoration-Pan-Hispanic Party clubhouse. When the police rushed in, the people present shouted "Long live the King!" "Long live the unified Spain!" Dr. Albina, a Pan-Hispanic Party member of parliament, was also present and immediately stated that he was a member of parliament and could not be arrested. He took out a pistol from his pocket and beat the police with the pistol grip. The police then reported to the Catalan Provincial Government's Interior Counselor, who immediately ordered the arrest and took personal responsibility for it, and then reported it to the central government.

<p>The Mega-Scammer is Also the Head of a Spy Network</p>
<p>Assassination Organization Reappears</p>
<p>Members of Parliament Suspected of Taking Bribes</p>
<p>(Paris) - The correspondent of Le Petit Parisien stationed in London telegraphed here with new and strange news about Stavisky, which he obtained from the Sunday Chronicle yesterday. Its source came from Germany and is considered reliable. According to this news, "Stavisky is not only a mega-scammer, but also the head of a spy network, who sold secret documents of French border fortresses to Germany. The scale of this spy organization is very large, and it is subsidized by at least two foreign governments. Stavisky's political conspiracy is even more significant than his financial fraud. It is extremely dangerous for European peace. It has recently been discovered that the secret documents sold to Germany are exactly what Berlin wanted to obtain. The German government paid Stavisky approximately 100,000 pounds for this matter. Therefore, Stavisky often went to Berlin under the guise of running a business, and Stavisky's footprints were often seen on Wilhelm Street, which is now the location of various military agencies. Some have suggested that the purpose of Stavisky's extensive organization is to search for important secret documents, and is not limited to defrauding money. There is sufficient reason for this speculation." (5th, Havas)</p>
<p>(Paris) - Minister of Justice Chiron declared today that there is now an organization that uses assassination as a means to obstruct the investigation of the Stavisky case. Prime Minister Doumergue said, "We are currently searching for this party." It is heard that the prosecutor has declared to the Minister of Justice that the suicide theory of former Chief Prosecutor Purinstem cannot be established. The French authorities are now more confident in investigating the killer in this case than generally speculated. The fact is that Purinstem was lured to the suburbs by bandits with a fake telegram about his mother's illness and killed because he knew the details of the mega-scam. (4th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Dijon - The case of the assassination of Paris Court of Appeals Judge Purinstem has not yet been solved. Today, the police found a copy of the January 27th newspaper near the tracks where Purinstem's body was found, torn by a sharp blade, with bloodstains on it, which was used to wipe the murder weapon. Since the Purinstem case occurred, the police station has received a total of 500 letters, some of which are anonymous, either reporting the names of the murderers or volunteering to assist in the investigation, but the police station considered them to be of no note. Chief Prosecutor Gu Supin of this city went to Paris to visit Minister of Justice Chiron to discuss the investigation of the Purinstem case. He recently declared to the press that the investigation work has reached a considerable stage, and there are now four clues to follow, and it will not be difficult to find the killer. (4th, Havas)</p>
<p>(Paris) - The police station continued to check the stubs of Stavisky's checkbook and examine several people, believing that the number of defendants would definitely increase as a result of the investigation. It is estimated that several members of parliament are also on the list. The judicial authorities will ask Congress to revoke the privilege of not being arrested for these members. (4th, Havas)</p>

<p>Marseille - A congress of Italian Socialist Party members residing in France was held here this afternoon. The Secretary-General of the Italian Socialist Party, Nanni, presented a report on the situation in Italy, saying that Italy will hold a referendum on March 25, but the result of the vote has already been determined in advance, because this vote is neither a free election that the dictatorship system is afraid of, nor an election in which various factions compete with each other. Nanni continued to describe the current situation of Italy's Pan-Fascist foreign policy, saying that Italy's actions on the Austrian issue are enough to pave the way for Hitler. Finally, he said that the Italian Socialist Party will never be disappointed because of this, and will continue to carry out its mission, especially to continue working in Italy and concentrate the power of the people to resist Pan-Fascism.

<p>Special Laws to Deal with Dictatorship</p>
<p>Referendum to Be Held at the End of This Week</p>
<p>Swiss Capital - The Swiss House of Representatives and the Federal Council believe that all political struggles in Switzerland should not adopt violence and revolutionary means, and should only be allowed to use legal political weapons. Therefore, a federal law has been specially formulated to protect public order. This law is specifically designed to deal with extremists who advocate dictatorship, and it opposes the methods used by both the Communist Party and the right-wing New Political Front. The purpose of the law is to protect democratic constitution and individual rights. All crimes of inciting harm to the country, disrupting military discipline, disrupting assemblies and marches, and participating in prohibited assemblies and marches are subject to different penalties. The law also prohibits the private possession and distribution of military weapons and bullets. Another clause stipulates the crime of foreign nationals acting in the interest of foreign countries. All of the above crimes are subject to different penalties. The Socialist Party and the Communist Party have formally taken a stand against the law and have collected the signatures of 30,000 citizens in accordance with the law to request a referendum vote. This referendum vote is scheduled to be held on March 10 and 11. Whether the law can be implemented in Switzerland will depend on the results of the vote. However, the Conservative Party, the Radical Party, the Farmers and Craftsmen, and the Bourgeoisie all advocate accepting the law. (5th, Havas)</p>

Last January, there were six million unemployed; now, that number has been reduced to three million two hundred and fifty thousand. He hopes that after the government begins its second campaign to save unemployment, the number of unemployed can be further reduced by two million.

<p>Large-Scale Railway Construction Amidst Financial Difficulties</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The House of Peers held a plenary session at 10:00 AM on the 5th. Aoki Shuzo, the former Vice Minister of Railways, questioned Railway Minister Mitsuchi regarding the revision of the Railway Construction Law. He essentially stated that the government, during this time of extraordinary financial difficulty, has stopped ongoing railway construction and started work on eight other railway lines, suggesting a possible problem with discipline behind the scenes. The chamber became extremely tense when Aoki raised the issue of discipline for the second time. (Domei Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The current cabinet has replaced the Army Minister, Commerce Minister, and Education Minister – three important figures – in just three months since the opening of the parliament. According to precedent, it should resign immediately. However, the current government intends to pass legislation through parliament and then fill cabinet positions with members of the Seiyukai party, striving to prolong its life. The Seiyukai party has recently softened its attitude towards the government, hence the optimistic view regarding the government's future. When the government negotiates with the Seiyukai to fill cabinet positions in the future, it intends to respond favorably to the request. Furthermore, the Minseito party no longer intends to actively overthrow the cabinet, and the atmosphere in the House of Representatives is not likely to worsen against the government. Although the House of Peers opposes the government due to issues of discipline, it is unlikely that the entire House of Peers will initiate a movement to overthrow the cabinet because there are no suitable candidates to assume the next government. It is possible that the government, after appointing new cabinet members, can continue in power until May or June. (Domei Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Aoki Shuzo stated in his speech that the most pressing issue in politics recently is the issue of ideology. Why do people's hearts sway to the extreme left and right? Because they are dissatisfied with the current state of affairs – namely, the corruption of political parties and the overbearing nature of financial cliques – leading to such a result. He hopes that people in political and financial circles will take note of this fact and earnestly exercise restraint.</p>
<p>Aoki then turned his criticism to the issue of discipline, saying, "If the government has a plan that is suspected by the people, it should openly deny it in the parliamentary hall so that the people can understand the truth. My question is to give the government the opportunity to clarify this matter. After taking office as Railway Minister, Mitsuchi has been actively pursuing construction plans, but observing this year's plan, there are indeed questionable points. Namely, this year's new plan involves building eight railway lines at a cost of 24 million yen. In this time of extraordinary financial circumstances, is it necessary to issue such a huge bond to carry out construction?"</p>
<p>Aoki then continued after examining each railway line in detail, saying:</p>
<p>"From this perspective, it can be seen that each railway line is being used by party politics for party strategy. Even if this bill does not pass the meeting, the country will certainly not suffer any loss as a result."</p>
<p>Railway Minister Mitsuchi replied:</p>
<p>"In my 20 years as a member of parliament, I have never used the railway for party politics or party strategy. Mr. Aoki's remarks are truly unexpected."</p>
<p>The Railway Minister explained each route, and the meeting adjourned at 12:24 PM.</p>

<p>Perpignan, France The land bordering France and Spain has a tiny country called Andorra, with an area of only 452 square kilometers and a population of just over 5,000. The land was originally jointly owned by the French and Spanish Bishop of Urgell. Now, a wealthy man named De Ribelles de Roça is willing to pay 400,000 pesetas (Spanish currency) to purchase the joint suzerainty of Andorra from the Bishop of Urgell. In addition, he promises the people of Andorra various financial benefits. It is reported that the Andorra Parliament has rejected the offer and does not recognize the transfer of joint suzerainty.

<p>Editor's Note The small country of Andorra declared its independence as far back as 819 AD. Since the time of Charlemagne, it has not experienced war, so it has no army. Recently, due to the serious international situation, it has also supplemented its constitution and trained a new army, so that the French gendarmerie will never again intrude as they did last summer. The so-called new army consists of 11 regular soldiers and 1,000 Home Guards. Four officers preside over the General Staff.

When demonstration leaders stood on a dozen or so soapboxes and gave impassioned speeches to the crowd, attacking the MacDonald government's unemployment policies, traffic was temporarily halted. The hunger marchers maintained order, but there were minor clashes when firecrackers and fruit were thrown and mounted police tried to restore traffic. It was evident that there were communist elements who used the tense mood of the crowd to demand the overthrow of the government and the organization of a revolutionary parliament. Dozens of red flags fluttered in the wind, accompanied by the Internationale. As the sun set, the demonstrators each quietly carried their communist music and banners back to their lodgings in the suburbs of London. (National Dispatch, 5th)</p>

<h3 id="e55">Sun Ke Reports on the Content of the Initial Draft of the Constitution <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>丨At the National Government Memorial Week丨</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At the National Government Memorial Week on the morning of the 5th, after Chairman Lin led the ceremony, Sun Ke reported on the content of the initial draft of the constitution. He said that the initial draft of the constitution had been extensively studied by the Legislative Yuan, based on the spirit of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People and the Outline of National Reconstruction. The entire document consists of ten chapters and 160 articles. The first few chapters are general principles, but the article on territory uses a listing method, specifying in particular detail, because during this period of national crisis, especially the four northeastern provinces, have been occupied by violence and have not yet been recovered, so a listing method should be adopted to achieve the goal of recovery. The second chapter stipulates the rights and obligations of the people, listing them separately in great detail. No article may be suspended or restricted except in accordance with the law. The last article of this chapter stipulates that any law that suspends or restricts the freedom or rights of the people shall be limited to what is necessary for social order and public interest, that is, the government's restrictions on the rights and obligations of the people must have a considerable limit. The third chapter is a provision on the national economy, which is relatively important. The first and second chapters are based on the principles of civil rights and people's livelihood, while this chapter is based on the principle of the People's Livelihood, the key points of which are equalizing land ownership and restricting capital, so the wording of the articles is more concrete. The fourth chapter is on national education, determining educational funding, with the central government providing 15% of the total budget and local governments providing 30% of their total budget. According to this provision, with increased funding, education can develop. The above four chapters are all about the principles, which are the basic program for building the country and developing the people's livelihood. The fifth chapter is the National Assembly chapter, in which the election quota of representatives is stipulated to be based on counties or cities, that is, each county or city can send one representative each, with approximately 2,000 representatives from more than 1,800 counties and cities across the country, including representatives from Mongolia and Tibet and overseas Chinese. Next, it is stipulated that the National Assembly shall be convened once every three years. After the National Assembly is closed, a National Representatives Assembly shall be established to replace the various powers of the National Assembly. There are some doubts about the powers of the National Assembly, as they cannot be listed. Some people suspect that the National Assembly cannot submit a vote of no confidence in the government, which is a mistake, because the President and the heads of the five Yuan are elected by the National Assembly, so when there is a vote of no confidence, they can be impeached by the National Assembly. Some people also say that the National Assembly cannot have legislative power, which is a mistake. Since the National Assembly is the highest authority in the country, it has the highest legislative power. What should be particularly noted in this chapter is the organization of the National Committee, which is equivalent to the current National Government Committee. The government's administration is still exercised by the five Yuan. It only takes over all matters after the National Assembly is closed and prepares for the convocation of the next assembly, and accepts matters between the Yuan that cannot be resolved. It is actually a liaison mechanism outside of the five Yuan. Now, in addition to the National Government Committee, there is also the Central Political Conference, which is above the five Yuan. In the future, after the constitution is promulgated and constitutional government is implemented, the Political Conference will be abolished, then this National Representatives Assembly will have to be established, which is above the five Yuan, to accept and resolve problems that the five Yuan cannot resolve. The sixth chapter is the powers of the central government and local governments, and the regulations are not much different from the current system. The seventh chapter is the central government system. In our country with the five-power constitution, the administrative responsibility should be borne by the Executive Yuan, so this draft stipulates that the President represents the country in name. The five Yuan are still separate under the President and are each responsible to the National Assembly. This system in which the head of state does not concurrently serve as the head of government is adopted by all countries except the United States. The United States is a country with a unified government, adopting a system in which the head of state also serves as the head of government. If we also adopt that system, the Executive Yuan would be out of balance with the Legislative Yuan, Judicial Yuan, Examination Yuan, and Control Yuan, and the independent spirit of the five Yuan would be affected, so the head of state and the head of government are separated into two people. The heads of the Legislative Yuan and the Control Yuan are elected by mutual election among the members of the Legislative Yuan and the Control Yuan, which is different from the way the heads of the Judicial Yuan and Examination Yuan are produced. The appointment and removal of the head of the Executive Yuan must be proposed by the President and approved by the National Assembly or the National Committee, because it is stipulated that if the head of the Executive Yuan proposes a vote of no confidence in the Legislative Yuan and it is accepted by the National Committee, or the Control Yuan proposes an impeachment motion and it is accepted by the National Committee, he should be removed from office, that is, the vote of no confidence in the Legislative Yuan and the impeachment motion proposed by the Control Yuan must be decided by the National Committee. In the future, the Ministry of Judicial Administration will be subordinate to the Judicial Yuan, and the Selection Committee of the Examination Yuan will be a temporary agency, which does not need to be stipulated in the constitution, so this draft constitution does not mention it. This draft stipulates that the province is an administrative region directly under the central government. The provincial governor is under the command of the central government, executes the central administrative affairs in the province, and supervises local autonomy. The province only has a Senate, which is different from the previous provincial assembly, and its powers are also more limited. The county is an autonomous unit, and the county assembly has the final decision-making power on the appointment and removal of the county magistrate. The organization of the city is roughly the same as that of the county, unless otherwise provided by law. The initial draft has been published, please criticize and provide opinions, especially for the organization of the central government and local governments, I hope everyone can have a full discussion and submit it to the legislative assembly for revision to create a perfect draft constitution.

Chairman Ju Zheng asked Shao Yuanchong to report, saying, "At this time of serious national crisis and tense international situation, we should make our party affairs work move towards effective efforts to save the crisis. The work in the past was biased towards formality and did not pay attention to the spirit. They are all routine matters in terms of meetings and documents. In the future, every comrade should bear special tasks in addition to their daily work, and make effective military efforts in terms of national survival competition, social construction, and education and culture, so that the foundation of the country's survival strength can be established. We have foreseen that after two or three years, the changes in the international situation will be concentrated in the Pacific Ocean, and it will be centered on our country. If we ourselves have no power to save the fate of the country and nation, no matter what, we will be in a position to be disposed of. In order to cope with the current situation, all countries in the world are working hard to prepare everything. Our country's economy is backward, and its national strength is insufficient. We should catch up as soon as possible to seek survival. How can we allow ourselves to be lucky enough to survive? Therefore, every comrade, from today onwards, should change the direction of their efforts and make effective preparations to save the country, so as to strengthen the national strength, so that we can overcome this international crisis and make our nation stand forever in the world." After the speech, the meeting adjourned at 10:00 AM. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 5th)</p>

Chairman Lin led the ceremony, and the Central Government sent Chu Minyi to preside over the oath and gave instructions, saying that Comrade Deng has been engaged in the revolution for many years. Before and after the founding of the Republic of China, he has often worked with me. His fighting spirit has long been admired by comrades. Comrade Deng is a native of Guangxi. During the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, Huang Xuchu, the Guangxi Committee, came to Beijing to attend. Comrade Deng has made great contributions in communicating the feelings between the Central Government and the Southwest. The Central Government has elected him as a member of the Government Committee, which will strengthen the Central Government and promote sincere unity. Comrade Deng will work harder. The other comrades are all experts in statistics and accounting. Now is the period of political tutelage. We should follow the outline of national construction and prepare for constitutional government. The survey and statistics of the country's finances, population, land, etc. are particularly important. I hope everyone will work hard. Then, Chairman Lin gave instructions, the general idea being that Comrade Deng followed the Premier and participated in the revolutionary cause. After the founding of the Republic, he was elected as a member of the National Assembly and later participated in the Protection of the Constitution, bravely advancing. Now, he is taking office as a member of the Government Committee, and I am happy about it. At this time of serious national crisis, having Comrade Deng to support the central government will greatly help the country. The other comrades are all specialized in their fields and are able to take on the important responsibilities of statistics and accounting. Now, the country's finances are gradually getting on the right track, and we are deeply dependent on you for the reorganization of finances.

<p>The Executive Yuan Formulates Four Guiding Principles</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan has formulated four guiding principles for the reduction of surtaxes on farmland and has issued a circular to all provinces and cities for implementation. The content is as follows: (1) Formulate a county local finance budget, and list all regular and temporary income and expenditure of the entire county, regardless of whether they are collected and paid by the county government agencies and district and township offices, into the general budget. After review by the county, report to the provincial government for strict review. (2) The provincial government reviews the county local budget and shall reduce various surtaxes on farmland as appropriate depending on whether they are needed, the urgency, and whether they should be borne by the local government. If the county's approved project expenses are insufficient due to the restriction of surtaxes, in addition to appropriately compensating by increasing taxes on land reports and urban non-residential land, the provincial government may also allocate funds for subsidies. If the provincial budget is insufficient, it may be reported to the Central Government for approval to provide assistance. (3) All financial income and expenditure of the county, whether it is county funds or district funds, shall be uniformly reviewed and separately announced by the county financial agency, and all legal entities shall be allowed to check the accounts at any time. (4) After the county budget is approved and announced, if there are income and expenditure outside the budget, unless they have been approved by the provincial government in advance, the province shall formulate penalty regulations and deal with them strictly.

<h3 id="e86">A Letter to the Nation from the Guangdong People Regarding the Macau Issue <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Portugal was the first imperialist to invade China, and Macau, where a serious problem is currently occurring, was the first place to be invaded. In world history, Portugal was already a developed maritime nation in the sixteenth century. It carried out occupations everywhere. During the reign of Ming Jiajing, it occupied Macau in China. Since Portugal forcibly occupied Macau, the problems it has caused have been countless times. The Portuguese invasion of Hengqin two years ago and the recent approval of the Japanese alcohol monopoly and the monopoly of products produced in various parts of Japan and Taiwan are the most serious and worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>Macau is originally a place belonging to our town, so the boundary is adjacent. Since the Portuguese occupied it, they have repeatedly nibbled away at the land of our town. We cannot tolerate it any longer. We love our home, we love our country. The problem of Macau is the problem of our country. We bravely request the government to solve it and bravely awaken the people of our town and our compatriots to rise up and resist aggression. We were born in the sacred hometown of the Founder (Sun Yat-Sen), and we believe in our own revolutionary ability. We dare not be presumptuous and raise our self-defense and righteous flag, and we hope that the people of the town and our compatriots will express their sympathy and effort.</p>
<p>What we need to pay attention to now is to oppose the alcohol monopoly and further solve the outstanding cases and take back Macau.</p>
<p>The Macau issue is like this:</p>
<p>(1) The Japanese Merchant's Alcohol Monopoly in Macau: This is a recent event. The fact is that the Japanese merchant, Watada, obtained the Portuguese government's approval to monopolize commodities in Macau. The alcohol monopoly is a precedent for the commodity monopoly. The Japanese only pay 60,000 yuan a year as an exchange condition. This event shows: (A) Portuguese-Japanese collusion and aggression, (B) Japanese merchants' rapid expansion of the South China market, (C) Japan's attempt to increase trade relations in South China and gradually involve international and military relations, (D) Military raw materials - such as alcohol, which has just started to be monopolized, and "medicines," which are about to be monopolized - preparation for storage. Based on these considerations, the seriousness of this event is indeed alarming.</p>
<p>In recent years, with the development of machinery and overproduction, coupled with the sluggish economy, capitalists from various countries have mostly adopted dumping policies in order to prosper their businesses. Japan's market is still small, and invading South China is also an opportunity for remedy. Japanese merchants obtaining monopoly rights in Macau has this meaning in any case. However, our country is suffering from the economic aggression of various countries. Our own industry and commerce are completely defeated, and our own poverty is intensifying day by day. During the period of our country's economic construction, this Japanese commercial policy should be actively opposed. Moreover, once trade relations occur between countries, diplomatic and military relations will follow. However, this is often Japan's military aggression policy... If the Japanese merchant's monopoly is successful, then it is a hidden danger in South China. Moreover, the alcohol and so-called medicines that Japan wants to monopolize can be used as raw materials for military weapons. In this way, Japan monopolizing alcohol in Macau is not only a matter of the loss of interests of the overseas Chinese merchants in Macau, but also a problem of our country's border security. We must oppose the Japanese, but first of all, we must oppose the Portuguese and Japanese.</p>
<p>(2) Hengqin Request: Since the Portuguese rented Macau, they have successively occupied the Inner Barrier Gate, Green Island, Wanzai, and Coloane... The two islands of Da Hengqin and Xiao Hengqin on the opposite bank are also places they have long wanted to occupy. Until October of the year before last, the Portuguese arrested Chinese officials on the island and prohibited surveying. The Portuguese wanted to occupy the island as their own, but unexpectedly it became a reality.</p>
<p>At that time, the people and the government expressed their opposition, but the matter is still unresolved. Originally, Hengqin has always been a local area of the town, and this case should be resolved as soon as possible to prevent Hengqin and its neighboring areas from becoming a continuation of the Inner Barrier Gate. Therefore, now is the time to take advantage of the occurrence of the alcohol monopoly incident and make efforts to resolve it.</p>
<p>(3) Boundary Issues: The main reason for the occupation of the Inner Barrier Gate and other places and the occurrence of the Hengqin case is that the boundary has not been demarcated.</p>
<p>Macau is a peninsula. During the reign of Ming Jiajing, the Portuguese occupied it. At first, they paid a rent of 20,000 taels, which was later reduced to 500 taels. By the time of Daoguang, it was simply stopped. During the Guangxu period, the Portuguese even forced the Qing court to sign a treaty to obtain the right to permanently manage Macau. However, from renting to transferring, there was no clear boundary demarcation, so the Portuguese had the convenience of nibbling away at neighboring areas. Unclear boundaries are almost the reason for the Macau issue since the beginning. Now the boundary issue is something that must be resolved.</p>
<p>(4) Macau's Land Advantage and Customs Duties: Customs duties are one of the country's resources and a fortress for the country to protect its own industry and commerce. In recent times, due to commercial wars, the importance of customs duties has become even greater. In our country, because Macau's sovereignty belongs to Portugal and Macau has been opened as a commercial port, the Gongbei Customs is set up on the waterway and the Qianshan Customs is set up on the land route. However, due to Macau's land advantage, smuggling can always occur and is very frequent. There are dozens of companies in Macau specializing in smuggling. In this way, the impact of Macau on customs duties can be described as extremely bad.</p>
<p>(5) The Safety and Commercial Problems of Overseas Chinese in Macau: Apart from a very small number of Portuguese, Indians, and blacks, Macau is entirely Chinese. Most of them are engaged in business. The Chinese residing in Macau can mostly maintain their peaceful nature and fulfill their tax obligations. However, the Macau government does not assume responsibility for protection at all, and harsh orders and acts of violence occur frequently. Like the massacre in the eleventh year, more than 100 of our overseas Chinese compatriots were killed or injured. The recently promulgated fish merchants' relocation law and the newspaper regulations simply deprive overseas Chinese merchants of their freedom. The safety and commercial problems of overseas Chinese are now very noteworthy.</p>
<p>(6) Social Degeneration: Since the Portuguese occupied our Macau, they not only did not plan to prosper the industry and commerce of this place, but instead allowed opium dens, gambling houses, and brothels to expand, increasing the power of social degeneration and harming our overseas Chinese compatriots. The Portuguese also used the convenience of unequal treaties to specifically protect Chinese reactionary politicians, reactionary soldiers, bandits, and criminals, making it difficult to completely solve the problem of domestic security. The unsoundness of Macau's society affects the health of Chinese society a lot. This is also an issue that we Chinese should pay attention to.</p>
<p>Compatriots, pay attention to our border areas.</p>
<p>Compatriots, for the welfare of the country, take back Macau from our country as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Nanchang Communication, the Yu-Ping railway project was originally scheduled to start on March 1st, but due to the slow preparations for the construction of the Yu-Ping Railway Company established by the Railway Department, construction could not begin on time. It is now known that the board of directors of the Yu-Ping Railway Construction Company has been scheduled to be established in Beijing on the 5th of this month. The Railway Department has telegraphed Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces to send personnel to attend. The provincial government has appointed Wu Jiantao and Xiao Chunjin to attend. Wu and Xiao are scheduled to depart today (the 3rd). It is also reported that the entire Yu-Ping railway project is limited to two years for completion. The section from Nanchang to Yushan will be started first, and it is decided to start construction on April 1st and complete it within one year. The Nan-Ping section is also limited to one year, but because the funding is still being raised, the start date cannot be determined. As for the amount of public bonds issued for the construction of the road, the original amount was 12 million yuan. Now, due to insufficient expenditures, the Railway Department has approved a total amount of 60 million yuan to be issued. It is also reported that the Nanchang main station of the road has been decided to be located at the Shunwai Airport, and construction will begin in the coming days. (March 3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e89">Han Fuqu Advocates Vitality <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Absences from Morning Meetings Twice Will Result in Dismissal</p>
<p>Jinan Communication, Provincial Government Chairman Han Fuqu previously issued an order to the staff of various agencies, stipulating that memorial week encouragement meetings should be held every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, in order to promote vitality. However, each time, the names of the staff of various agencies were randomly called, and there were still cases of absence without reason. Yesterday (the 3rd), a special order was issued again to the staff of various agencies to abide by the time and attend the meeting. The order is as follows: "It is known that a strong country must first have a strong body, and early sleep can lead to early rising. Therefore, hearing the rooster crow and dancing, those who know will know that it will prosper. Moving bricks to practice diligence, the sages of the past did not dare to slack off. Since the chairman took office, he has repeatedly ordered strict observance of memorial week encouragement meetings to be held every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, originally in order to promote vitality, strengthen the body, and fulfill their responsibilities. However, each time, the names of the staff of various agencies were randomly called, and there were still cases of absence without reason. If strict rectification is not carried out, how can evil habits be eliminated and the future be encouraged? All provincial and external civil servants must understand this intention, rest early at night, eliminate useless socializing, cherish valuable time, and all abide by the stipulated time to attend the meeting. Those who have been approved by the chairman or have special circumstances are not subject to this limit. Others, from January 1st of this year to June 30th, those who are absent twice will be immediately dismissed and severely punished, and no leniency will be granted. In addition to separate orders, all agencies are hereby ordered to comply, and their subordinates are also ordered to comply. The chairman's words will be followed by the law. Do not deliberately violate them. This order." (4th)</p>

<p>Attack and Defense Targets All Aimed at Tianjin</p>
<h3 id="e91">Exercise Area Quite Extensive <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Communication, the Japanese garrison in Tianjin conducted exercises in Jinghai County, south of Tianjin. Prior to the exercise, the Japanese authorities had sent a letter to the Hebei Provincial Government, only stating that exercises would be held along the Jinpu Road in Jinghai, Liangwangzhuang, Duliu River, Tangguan, and other places, and that the scale was not very large. However, yesterday the official authorities received reports that the scope of this Japanese military exercise had expanded, and the troops participating were about 3,600 to 3,700 people, organized into six battalions. The exercise plan was to camp in Jinghai on the evening of the 1st and start a mock battle at 7:00 AM on the 2nd, divided into a Southern Army and a Northern Army. The Southern Army was commanded by Colonel Morimoto, commander of the regiment, and included mountain artillery, machine guns, infantry, armored vehicles, engineers, wireless communication teams, and ambulance teams. The number of people was three battalions, assuming an attack from Jinan, taking Tianjin along the Jinpu Road, and taking Machang as a key fortress. The Northern Army was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Tanigawa, deputy commander of the regiment, and included mountain artillery, infantry, cavalry, tanks, ambulance teams, communication teams, etc. The number of people was also three battalions, assuming Tangguantun and Chenguantun as the front line, and Machang as the rear defense. Commander Nakamura set up a general headquarters in that area, taking a defensive stance. The Southern Army's assumed unit number was the First Independent Division, and the Northern Army was the Tianjin Garrison Guard. The Southern Army attacked, and the Northern Army defended and pursued the enemy to Cang County. That night, it was assumed that enemy traces appeared in the Tanggu area, who were attacking from the sea. The marines and cavalry mixed together, echoing the Southern Army, and took the Machang Northern Army's rear defense. The Northern Army headquarters ordered the Tanigawa garrison to retreat to Tianjin, abandoning the Machang and Chenguantun Tangguantun defense lines. Tanigawa retreated while fighting. This was the first day's exercise item. On the morning of the 3rd, the Southern Army followed the enemy, and the two armies met at Liangwangzhuang, making a decisive battle. In addition, fifty veterans were organized into a militia, commanded by Captain Tamura, assuming that they would assist the Northern Army in defending Tianjin and operate behind the Southern Army. The Southern Army retreated slightly. The Northern Army was able to retreat to the southern suburbs of Tianjin and deployed defenses at Guandi Temple Gedacun. This was the second day's exercise item. On the third day, March 4, at dawn, the Southern Army and the detachment landing on the coast of Tanggu (undertaken by 500 troops stationed in Beiping) jointly attacked Tianjin, fighting with the Northern Army in the Guandi area, making charge melee combat, and street fighting. The exercise ended at 5:00 PM and returned to camp. The exercise area has occupied the four districts of Tanggu, Jinghai, Machang, and Cang County. The troops did not use live ammunition, and everything else was as real. Observing its intentions, it seems to be an ideal attempt to capture Tianjin. Although it is an exercise in nature, it cannot be taken lightly. (3rd)</p>

After resolution by the shareholders' meeting, the hand-weaving department was closed, and more than 100 workers were each given 24 yuan in severance pay, and they were dismissed.  However, the workers were unwilling to be dismissed. The day before, they gathered in the factory and did not disperse all night.  They were willing to reduce their work by one-third and asked the factory to continue for one year.  The factory refused, resulting in a stalemate.  Later, the Public Security Bureau sent police to suppress them and persuaded them, and the workers dispersed.  The county government convened a mediation meeting yesterday (the 5th) afternoon.  Shi Junqing, chairman of the County Chamber of Commerce, Liu Fuqing, chairman of the Iron Machine Association, Tao Shunan, representing the capital, Wang Zimu, Zhang Huanwen, and Yuan Genquan, representing the labor, discussed for a long time with Huang Sijiu, chairman of the county government, and decided to dismiss them.

The attendees were Gui Wuchen, member of the party committee, Mao Junbai, director, Yao Fusheng, representative of the county government, Hua Yiyun, Chen Tingbiao, Mao Yikang, Zhou Xiqin, representative of the capital, Jiang Linde, Lu Shixing, etc., representative of labor, and Wu Yushu, chairman of the cloth factory industry association. The result of the mediation was the decision: (1) The price of weaving cloth per yard will be reduced by 1.5 cents from last year's old price (according to the old price of 3 cents and 3 cents). (2) The monthly rent for workers living in the factory should be 2 corners (the Daxin and Zhenhua factories in the rural area are exempt from rent because there are no electric lights). Both parties agreed, and the storm subsided.</p>

<p>Two Carters Rape Two Young Girls. Wang Xueshi and Zhang Luzhi, two people from Huaian, live behind the Sheng Kung Hui Church on Bianyi Men Street in Yangzhou. They sell peanuts and melon seeds. One day, at dusk, Wang's daughter, Dayuanzi (21 years old), and Zhang's daughter, Maizi (18 years old), carried basins to the Infant Hall to fetch porridge. On the way, they met He Deyou and Zhang, two carters from Bao Ying, who ordered them to go with them, luring them with 60 yuan, otherwise they would be stabbed to death with a knife. They were forced to a secluded place in the rubble mountains near Fuyunmen, where the two carters raped the two girls. Now Wang and Zhang have sued their families. On the morning of the 3rd, they found the two carters and turned them over to the Public Security Bureau. The bureau did not accept the case because it was related to the judiciary. The family then filed a lawsuit with the Jiangdu branch court. After a detailed inquiry by the bailiff, the case was transferred to the prosecutor's office for investigation.</p>

Then, Dai Sanguan screamed in pain. Peng Sou was shocked and asked from the next room, but they were all silent. Later, he realized that there was nothing unusual and went to bed. It was not until the morning of the 4th that he realized that Dai Sanguanzi's tongue tip was bitten off by Wu's daughter while they were kissing.

<p>Record of Public Security Police Causing Trouble On the evening of the 4th, Jin Xun, the head of the Tianning Temple police station, passed through Beidajie. He saw many nude pictures in the Shenghe toy store and thought they were harmful to social morality. He took all twelve of the pictures. The store owner, Wu Chunsheng, and the people along the way were dissatisfied, saying that if it was a violation of the law, they should have been torn up on the spot and should not have been taken away. They questioned the police, and planned to go to the police station to solve the problem. After a few steps, Inspector Lv had already led armed police to swarm over. They beat people when they saw them, causing injuries to Ye Zhangcheng and Wang. At that time, the order was chaotic, and the police whistle sounded randomly. The crowd suspected it was a fire, and the fire dragons from various neighborhoods arrived one after another. In front of the police station, more and more people gathered. The police at the station knew that they had made a mistake and left. Each dragon friend must open their mouths when they arrive at various places, so they used water to shoot at the police station. Unexpectedly, the police brigade of the Public Security Bureau arrived at this time, and another conflict broke out. Hu Jingling was beaten and injured by the police. Each dragon friend was told there was a fire and they were beaten by the police, and they were really unwilling. Inspector Cheng Taichang went to the scene to persuade them, but it was ineffective. Then County Magistrate Jiang heard the news and arrived. County Magistrate Jiang persuaded the dragon friends to go to the fire brigade headquarters to discuss a solution. The executive committee members of the County Chamber of Commerce also arrived at the scene to persuade them. At that time, some dragon friends and the people mistakenly thought they were going to the General Bureau to solve the problem, so they went to the front of the Public Security Bureau to hear the news. It was midnight, and the voices were noisy. The police of the Public Security Bureau fired guns at the unarmed people again, causing Shen Jinguan and others to be shot and injured. Later, a team of artillery battalions maintained order in front of the Public Security Bureau and explained to the crowd that it was wrong for the police to shoot and advised them to disperse immediately and listen to the solution tomorrow. Finally, after the persuasion of County Magistrate Jiang and the executive committee members of the Chamber of Commerce, the people were able to disperse. On the 5th, the County Chamber of Commerce and the Fire Brigade convened meetings one after another, but there was still no essential solution. As for Gao Derun, the Director of the Public Security Bureau, he received a call that night when he was on leave in Shaoxing. He arrived in Hezhou by car early on the 5th. The Public Security Bureau and the Tianning Temple police station threw objects around after taking pictures, preparing to negotiate with the local government.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Shanghai Customs Machinery Products Exhibition Hall Holds Opening Ceremony Yesterday <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Tax Officer Mellersh Delivers Opening Speech.  Minister Kong, Mayor Wu, etc. All Delivered Speeches. Open Regularly After Guided Tours.</p>
<p>In order to enable domestic and foreign people to understand the situation of domestic goods, the Shanghai Customs specially collected the products of all factories in the Shanghai Customs area that enjoy the treatment of machine-made foreign goods, and set up an exhibition hall for permanent display and exhibition. It was held at 2:30 p.m. yesterday in the auditorium on the third floor of the Shanghai Customs on Sanma Road. Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Shanghai Customs Supervisor Tang Haian, General Tax Officer Mellersh, Director of the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance Shen Shuyu, as well as important officials of the Shanghai Customs and more than 200 guests, all went to participate. After the ceremony, Minister Kong, Mayor Wu, etc. personally went to the exhibition hall to visit, and dispersed at about 4:00 p.m. The Public Concession Bureau of the Public Concession temporarily stood Chinese and Western detectives at the entrance and exit of the Shanghai Customs to protect it. The details are as follows.</p>
<p>Mellersh Reports</p>
<p>After the ceremony, Mellersh first delivered an opening speech, saying, "The machine-made foreign goods exhibition hall attached to the Shanghai Customs is holding an opening ceremony today. We respectfully invite Minister of Finance Kong to lead the instruction and announce the opening to show the solemnity. We are grateful to all the guests for their presence and guidance, which shows their enthusiasm for promoting machine-made goods and their support for the progress of this office. It is a congratulation to the future of China's industrial and commercial industries, and it is not only the honor of all the colleagues in the Customs who set up this office. Before the opening, I will briefly describe the origin of the establishment of this office and the hope for the future of industry and commerce. The purpose of China's machine-made goods is to seek industrial improvement and prevent the competition of foreign goods. Its relationship with the national economy and the people's livelihood is profound and huge. However, in this era of fierce commercial warfare, all countries are seeking various ways to dump their manufactured products abroad. If China does not actively promote machine-made goods, it will not be enough to maintain the national products and block the leakage. Although there are many ways to promote it, the most important key is to gather all kinds of machine-made goods together and compare them in detail to achieve the effect of observation. Without the joint discussion of the industrial and commercial circles, there is no way to promote the opportunity for improvement. This office is set up so it cannot be ignored. Since the Shanghai Customs building was completed, it was planned to realize this plan in due course, but it did not work due to various reasons. In recent years, we have been operating diligently and preparing actively, and we have been able to see success today. Now the samples of machine-made goods produced by various factories in the Shanghai Customs area are displayed in this office and opened to the public for exhibition, so that all parties can know which goods are superior, which are inferior, which have already taken shape</p>

<p>Two Gambling Cases Cracked in the French Concession</p>
<p>Gan Fugen, a 33-year-old local paint worker residing at No. 16, Donglin Lane, No. 235, Route Gustavia, French Concession, has recently been taking advantage of the Lunar New Year by organizing and profiting from gambling at night. The location changed every night, making it difficult for the French police to catch him despite their investigations. However, on the night before last, it was discovered that Gan was gambling in his living room. Detectives Xie Guangming and Hang Bingquan, along with officers Cai Zongyi and others from the Gambling Squad, raided the premises at 12:20 am. The living room was packed with people, enthusiastically playing Pai Gow. The police arrested the ringleader, Gan Fugen, along with 35 gamblers, including Cao Zhangyun, Zhao Yongsheng, Kong Atang, and a woman named Zhao Wangshi. They confiscated a set of Pai Gow tiles, two dice, 25 silver dollars, 172 double coppers, 9 jiao coupons, and 2,400 copper coins. Upon investigation, it was found that Gan had been arrested and sentenced to six months in prison in August of the 19th year of the Republic for participating in communist activities. He had also been dealt with several times for gambling and opium-related offenses. The police chief ordered him to be detained along with the others for further investigation.</p>
<p>Also, a local man named Cao Shouren, 32 years old, was organizing gambling and taking commissions in Room 18 of the Gongping Hotel at No. 291, Baoyu Lane, Route Edward VII, on the night before last. Detectives from the Gambling Squad rushed to the scene and arrested Cao along with 14 gamblers, including Li A'er, Fan Xilin, Jin Xiaoting, and Li Yutang. They confiscated a set of Pai Gow tiles, a set of mahjong tiles, 18 silver dollars, 29 double coppers, and 2,300 copper coins. Yesterday, they were taken to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. The police lawyers filed charges in batches. After questioning by Judge Wu Fanglian, Gan Fugen was sentenced to six months in prison and fined 120 yuan for providing a gambling venue with the intent to profit and as a repeat offender. Six gamblers, including Cao Zhangyun, were each fined 20 yuan, and eight gamblers, including Zhao Yongsheng, were each fined 10 yuan. Twenty men and women, including Kong Ajin and Zhao Wangshi, were found not guilty. Cao Shouren and twelve gamblers, including Li A'er and Fan Xilin, were each fined 5 yuan, while Jin Xiaoting and Li Yuting were found not guilty. The gambling equipment and funds were confiscated. During the appeal period, Gan Fugen was detained due to his imprisonment, while those fined and those found not guilty were required to provide cash bail or a guarantor who could be summoned at any time.</p>
<p>Factory Girl Seduced and Arrested</p>
<p>Zhao Wu, a local woman, and Zhao Nanbao, a 39-year-old woman, lived in a flat at No. 327, Huade Road. Zhao Nanbao worked as a female worker at the Jiangnan Tobacco Factory on the same road and was somewhat attractive. A neighbor from Suzhou, Chen Jinlong, 30 years old, often flirted with her. On the evening of January 24, at around 9 pm, Chen tricked her into going to the Asia Hotel on Hankou Road, where they had sexual intercourse in a room. The next morning, he used the phone to notify Xu Daoyuan, the second landlord of the woman's nearby lamp shop, to take Zhao Nanbao back from the hotel. She was beaten by her mother. According to reports, the Huishan police station arrested Chen on Jingzhou Road the day before yesterday, and took him into custody. Yesterday morning, the Ministry of Works lawyer Wang Yaotang gave a statement of the case to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, and said that Zhao Nanbao was sent to Kwang仁 Hospital for examination to prove that she had been raped, but she is now in Pudong, so she did not appear in court. Next, Zhao Wu, the woman's mother, and Xu Daoyuan, the witness, testified to the incident. When asked, the defendant confessed that he knew the woman for half a year, and a week ago, he agreed at the gate of the tobacco factory to go to the hotel to open a room for one night. The woman refused to go home the next morning and was willing to be his wife, but her parents did not agree, so he told Xu Daoyuan to come and take her back. Yu Gongzhi, Judge Xiao Xieffen ordered him to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the case to be verified when the woman Zhao Nanbao arrived in court.</p>
<p>The Killed Bandit Verified Yesterday</p>
<p>At around 7 pm on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, five bandits suddenly broke into No. 177 Connaught Road and robbed 500 yuan in cash, forbidding anyone from making a sound. One of the bandits fired a shot before leaving. The victim frantically blew a whistle, and two Chinese police officers, No. 356 and No. 991, from the Gordon Road police station happened to be patrolling nearby. Hearing the alarm, they rushed to the scene. The bandits, realizing the situation was bad, immediately opened fire to resist arrest, but fortunately, they did not hit anyone. The police officers, having no other choice, also drew their pistols and returned fire, killing one bandit on the spot. The remaining bandits escaped. The matter was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It has been learned that the police station in charge dispatched Chief Detective Zhang Liang and others to investigate. The body was taken to the Fielan Road morgue, and a pistol containing six bullets was found on the deceased bandit. It was also discovered that the bandit had committed several robberies. His name was Zhou Zhusan, and he was 35 years old. The victim was an Indian who had previously been a bailiff in a certain place and had accumulated some savings. Recently, the bandits learned of this and went to rob him the night before last. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court was notified and dispatched Inspector Guo Wei, along with two forensic doctors, Wei and Zhang, and Clerk Wang Zuyi, to the morgue for an autopsy. According to the Indian victim, Amai Xin, 43 years old, five bandits broke into his house the night before last. Three bandits went to his room to search and rob, while two bandits stood guard outside. He was robbed of 500 yuan. The dead bandit was the one who fired the shot before leaving. The two Chinese police officers, No. 356 and No. 991, reported the situation at the time. Guo Jun then ruled that the deceased, Zhou Zhusan, had resisted arrest and was shot in the chest by the police, resulting in his death on the spot. A pistol and six bullets were confiscated and handed over to the police for safekeeping. The body was handed over to the Pushan Cemetery for burial.</p>
<p>Crane Detaches Hook, 800-Pound Paper Roll Kills Worker</p>
<p>On the 659th iron barge of the Lai Company, on the 3rd (the other day) at about 2 pm, hundreds of pieces of velvet were loaded and shipped to the (transliteration) English Ganli ship moored at No. 35 and No. 36 in the Yangshupu Pujiang. During the unloading process, the iron hook of the crane on the ship suddenly came loose, causing a roll of paper weighing about 700 or 800 pounds to fall from the sky. Xie Qishan, a worker who was helping to unload the goods, was hit by it, causing injuries to his chest and back, and even fractures of his spine. He bled heavily and was barely breathing. The water patrol police station was immediately notified, and detective Shen Changshan rushed to the scene and sent the injured man to the Sacred Heart Hospital in Xia Hai Miao for treatment. Because the injuries were too severe, he could not be saved and died about fifteen minutes after arriving at the hospital. Detective Shen sent the body to the Nanshi Rescue Bureau. Yesterday morning, the Water Patrol Police Station sent a letter to the local court requesting an autopsy. The foreman Chen Bugao, the machine operator Han Dengbing, the foreman Xue Zhengfa, and the workers on the barge, Wang Yinfa and Zhou Sanxiao, were all taken into custody. After the prosecutor's interrogation, it was confirmed that the accident was caused by the hook coming loose. The deceased was 29 years old, from Taixian, and had no family in Shanghai. The prosecutor then led the examiners to the Rescue Bureau, confirmed that the death was caused by being crushed, and ordered the foreman to provide a coffin for burial.</p>
<p>Rice Swindler Who Entered Through the Front Door and Exited Through the Back Door Was Handed Over to the Authorities</p>
<p>The swindler, Lin Zhirui, 40 years old, from Ningbo, lived at No. 18, Route Edward VII, French Concession, and specialized in swindling rice. At the end of last year, Lin Zhirui went to Tongtaichang in Pudong to buy two shi of rice. The shop assistant, Ge Jianji, accepted the payment from Lin and spoke highly of him. Ge thought that Lin was a good customer and treated him cordially. However, Lin recently crossed the river to Tongtaichang to buy ten dan of rice and asked for it to be sent to NingShao Wharf immediately. When the rice was sent, he saw two other people at the wharf also delivering ten dan of rice. Lin said that the payment could be collected with him. When they arrived at the Sansing Real Estate Company behind the Xian Shi Company in the British Concession, Lin asked Ge to wait outside. Unexpectedly, the real estate company had a back door. Ge, waiting for Lin to come out, went inside to inquire but found nothing. He chased out through the back door and saw Lin in front of him. He chased him to the Pacific Hotel before catching him and calling the police. The police chief learned that the case occurred in the Chinese territory and was inconvenient to handle, so he sent the police to Mingguo Road and arrested him at the First Precinct of the Second District. After interrogation by Director Shen, Lin Zhirui confessed to swindling rice. The case was transferred to the General Bureau for handling.</p>

Zhang was unemployed and owed several months' rent, which he could not repay. On the eighth day of the first lunar month, he was ordered by Lu Changde to move to No. 14 Huacheng Lane, a three-story attic next door. His son, Jinlin, was introduced by a friend to work as an apprentice in a printing shop near the Xieqiao in Nanshi. At 1:30 pm the day before yesterday, Jinlin was riding a bicycle on business and was traveling along the road at No. 1158 Railway Station Road, in front of Wantai Chenghao, when he fell to the ground due to the unstable bicycle. A truck with the registration number 3803 of the Shanghai Municipal Government driven by Zhai A'si (34 years old) of the Dafuyun Freight Car Company at No. 583 Wufuli, Tokyo Road, Public Concession, was also driving from south to north behind him. Jinlin was run over and his right leg was crushed. A nearby police officer saw this and stopped the driver and the truck, sending them to the Second District and then to the General Bureau for handling. The injured man was sent to Shanghai Hospital for emergency treatment, but due to severe injuries and excessive blood loss, he died at around 11 pm that night.

<p>Reading and Question Answering - Reading and Writing (2)</p>
<p>I received your letter half a month ago. We are only able to respond to you today because: (1) We have too many letters piling up, and we really cannot respond to your letter earlier; (2) Because your academic ability is higher than that of the average reader, we prioritize helping lower-level readers solve their difficulties, because their needs are more urgent. Therefore, we often receive accusations or urgings from some friends in their letters, and we are very ashamed. Now, we would like to take this opportunity to state this once again.</p>
<p>We have carefully read your letter and the attached manuscript twice. We can confidently say that, based on these two pieces of writing alone, you have already achieved the ability to write with "general fluency" and "write as you please". Not only that, but we have also seen the "genius" for writing in your work. If you can continue to work hard and take the path of recognizing social reality, all the problems of writing techniques can be gradually overcome. You will definitely become a progressive writer.</p>
<p>The scope of our guidance is originally to provide some basic (it can be shallow, but it must be very accurate) reading assistance to low-level readers. We have no intention of talking about literature at a high level or guiding people to become writers. Moreover, as for the editor personally, I am not a famous author myself, so how dare I talk about creative experience to guide young people? Because I feel that you are "full of enthusiasm" but "have no way to ask for advice," and you are a person who has come from such difficult self-study, so out of sympathy, I cannot help but feel that I should not let you be completely disappointed, so let's talk about it very sincerely?</p>
<p>We do not advocate that people seek success from writing. Turgenev once had a famous saying: "I would rather fail in my career than seek success in writing." I don't know how moved I was when I read it! The current era in China is completely the same as the era in which he said this, so it is really unnecessary to persuade people to become writers today. However, we are not against literature, nor do we necessarily want to stop people from becoming writers. We only feel that everyone who lives in today's Chinese society should bear a little of the mission of the times and strive for the interests of the masses. No matter which field you are in, you cannot jump out of this. Otherwise, no matter what you do, it is either completely useless or even harmful. It is also possible to be a writer, but you should grasp the core of the times and serve the masses in a down-to-earth manner, not just writing and praising, but carefully writing out everyone's needs and indicating the current trends. If so, the division of labor of occupations may be different, but the realization of the will of the masses is the same, then we can only raise our hands high and welcome the birth of such new writers in China.</p>
<p>As for the many questions you mentioned, whether they are about reading or writing, they are all necessary phenomena in the process and have nothing to do with your brain weakening or anything else. "Reading" and "writing" both have a certain process, in which many difficulties will inevitably occur, which will make people discouraged for a while, but people who achieve success are always those who persevere and move forward in the footsteps of failure. For example, when talking about social science, it is bound to feel dry and tasteless at the beginning. You don't understand the terminology, you don't understand the methodology, and after reading a book, you can't help but get only a vague impression. However, once you read more books, you will find sources everywhere and take care of each other. A few points that are difficult to understand in Book A, now you understand in Book B. What you thought you understood before, or you find your own mistakes in another book – it was a misunderstanding before, not a real understanding. Your understanding will expand and deepen as the scope of your own exploration expands. Only by moving forward step by step like this can there be hope of considerable success. As for people who have a considerable foundation in social science, are there no difficulties? No! Never! Numerous new difficulties are placed on each process. Learning is endless. Really successful people are constantly overcoming these difficulties. He does not make static observations, does not lose heart, does not ease his aspirations, and does not make excessively mysterious fantasies. He wants to climb to the sky in one step. This is the attitude that should be taken when reading.</p>
<p>Speaking of writing, the same investigation should also be made. Its success cannot be expected to pay too little price! People who are new to writing will naturally encounter that they only have "ambition" but cannot write good things. "Material selection", "diction", "structure", and "modification" cannot all be done with one heart and one hand. There are too many materials, and I don't know how to cut them. This is like a person who is new to photography, who doesn't know what to capture when he arrives in the forest; "diction", he often finds that there are not enough words, and the words do not express the meaning, which makes the writing lack vividness; the result is even more difficult, often loose, stereotyped, and becomes a completely meaningless "arrangement of sentences." The outline has been made, but I don't know how to modify it to make it beautiful and readable. All of this has been personally tasted by every friend who holds a pen. Therefore, every beginner writer is always like you, "so depressed that he hits his own head." There are always many incomplete manuscripts in his drawer, only starting one head and failing to complete it well, and it will never be completed: a manuscript must be revised and revised, copied and recopied, and the result is still unsatisfactory, and he sighs and ends the matter. However, this is exactly the phenomenon that should occur in the writing process, and every writer should endure it. It is the price of success. If you regard creation as "completed in one stroke, so that you don't have to delete or modify a word", this is always inappropriate. It is too easy to take success. Even if you really encounter such a genius, he must have suffered. You can't be like him, you need to pay a considerable price! The great French writer France, this writer, I think you also know him, when he talked about his writing experience, he honestly told the reader that it was very difficult for him to write articles. He often revised and revised, cut and cut, and sometimes even changed the "head" to the tail and put the tail on the "head". Even when others are praising it, he still has to burn it and come back again, sitting at his desk and thinking hard. Do you think it is easy to be a writer? Many people who have become famous look back on their hard work in their lives, but they regret that they were too stupid and why they had to engage in this difficult work. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn "Rituals" and "Teachings"  Wei Jing</p>
<p>The seven necessities to begin the day are firewood, rice, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, and tea. In ancient times, there was no need to promote homespun cloth because everyone naturally wore cheap and beautiful homespun cloth. Land prices were low, so there was no need to launch rent reduction campaigns. When it came to transportation, even if people were running around for food and clothing, they didn't have to run around as busily as they do today. Among the four necessities of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, the most difficult one was naturally food. Therefore, the people regard food as heaven, and the seven necessities to begin the day focus on "food".</p>
<p>Now, the economic situation has changed. The tripod-like "clothing, food, and housing" has evolved into the table-like "clothing, food, housing, and transportation". The conditions for beginning the day that focus on "food" are no longer considered the only element of human life.</p>
<p>"Clothing, food, housing, and transportation" are indeed indispensable, but after struggling under the pressure of life for many years, I have realized from experience that in addition to these four, there are two words that are not found in the classics, but they also occupy the same position as clothing, food, housing, and transportation. The first is "rituals". When a red invitation comes, you have to give a gift. When a white invitation comes, you also have to give a gift. When a friend has a son, you have to give a gift. When a neighbor takes a concubine, you have to give a gift. Not to mention losing friends and relatives, just take superiors as an example. In addition to the three festivals of the Dragon Boat Festival, the Mid-Autumn Festival, and New Year's Eve, you also have to deal with countless special events such as the old master's seventieth birthday and the young master's shaving and full moon celebration. If you are determined to "rather owe debt than owe rituals", then, sorry, please find another job. In order to maintain clothing, food, housing, and transportation, this "ritual" is indispensable.</p>
<p>The second is "teaching". If you raise a child without teaching him, it is the father's fault. Since you have given birth to children who call me "father", and you are afraid of becoming a sinner who is scolded by your children, you must educate your children. Speaking of education, naturally, this is enough to give people a headache. Because now schools collect tuition fees before giving class cards. You can only attend classes with the card, and there is no credit. So, the children play with a sad face until the last day of the holiday, and the fathers and brothers have to plan the tuition fees with a sad face. In order to be "not guilty" to the children, they have to do their best to educate their children.</p>
<p>Having suffered enough from the pressure of life such as clothing, food, housing, and transportation, and then adding the constraints of "rituals" and "teachings", it is really not easy to be a human being.</p>
<p>On the Inland River Steamer  Tu Hongxia</p>
<p>The epitome of society is on the inland river steamer.</p>
<p>Inside the cabin, several people who looked like workers were playing Pai Gow. The sounds of shouting reached outside the cabin. "Heavenly Eight," "Earthly Nine"... With that, there was a series of sounds of copper coins colliding with copper coins. After a moment of silence, the commotion started again, repeating over and over.</p>
<p>A yellow-haired woman, following her father, whose face was already marked by opium, went from cabin to cabin, singing tunes such as "Eighteen Touches" and "Four Seasons of Lovesickness", to dispel the passengers' loneliness. Handfuls of copper coins ran into their arms.</p>
<p>An opium addict with a face full of opium addiction pushed open the cabin door and said in a low voice: "Want opium?"</p>
<p>The passengers were arguing over seats, waves after waves piercing the eardrums.</p>
<p>Wealthy friends sat in the first-class cabins, and poor friends sat in the passenger cabins and under the awnings. The natural class system was on display.</p>
<p>The sailors and waiters on the boat were indeed much more polite to the guests sitting in the first-class cabins! Passengers under the awnings, sitting on the awnings where they could only hold their waists, were often glared at by the waiters.</p>
<p>Can this not be said to be the epitome of society?</p>
<p>Shanghai Movie Talk Forty-Nine Years Ago  Shijiu</p>
<p>I inadvertently found a copy of the Shen Bao from October 17, the eleventh year of the Guangxu Emperor. An essay in the newspaper is "A Record of Watching Shadow Plays." According to the record: At that time, there was a Mr. Yan Yongjing who "traveled around the earth for a week... and returned to China after more than ten years; upon his return, he stored more than a hundred paintings in his luggage, all of which depicted the customs, human feelings, rituals, music, punishments, and politics of various countries, as well as boats, vehicles, houses, cities, crowns, garments, mountains, waters, flowers, and birds, all of which were exquisitely rendered and accurately depicted. In his spare time, he placed them on a machine and illuminated them with a light gas lamp. The five colors were intermingled, as clear as paintings. The common people called it a shadow play", then the so-called shadow play at that time was undoubtedly a magic lantern.</p>
<p>The motive for this shadow play performance was to help disaster relief. The location was the main hall of the Gezhi College. The dates were the fifteenth, seventeenth, and second nights. The time was from 7:00 to 10:00. The admission fee was five jiao in foreign currency per person, and all proceeds went to disaster relief donations.</p>
<p>On the night of the full moon, the newspaper reporter went to watch with a companion. According to his record, when the performance started, "a circle appeared on the cloth, shining like the moon, and a beautiful woman held a rectangular sign with the four characters 'Heroes Gather' written on it... After the beauty passed by, a heavenly official came out... The sign held was the same as the beauty's, but the characters were changed to 'Chinese and Foreign Celebrate Together'". Later, a spherical earth appeared, and then a flat earth. "Mr. Yan gave lectures and pointed out the pictures, not afraid of being tedious; everyone held their breath and listened, and no one dared to make noise." According to this, Mr. Yan was not only enthusiastic about charitable causes, which is worthy of respect; but also his painstaking efforts to enlighten the people's wisdom were also worthy of praise by later generations. "Mr. Yan's travels began in Shanghai; therefore, after the earth was finished, he then performed the Public Gardens of Hongkou, and then showed the Clear Morning Picture of the Huangpu River and the Sunrise Picture of the Sea and Sky: this was the beginning of navigation." Then came a film of Kelapa Island, a territory of India, with a total of four pictures. From the pictures, we can know that the residents of the island at that time all belonged to Islam; the sedan chairs they rode were shaped like boxes, carried by two people; the women's bodies were half-exposed, and their color was as black as lacquer. Later came a film of the equator, with sailors acting as the Dragon King performing plays and dancing. It is</p>

<p>The Power of Financial Giants Maintains Gold Market Stability. Although There is a Canton Group Selling Heavily, There is Still a Four-Corner Rebound.</p>
<p>The gold market was extremely stable yesterday. The market situation remained fluctuating, and market sentiment was quite good. Therefore, although the Canton Group was selling gold bars vigorously, the situation remained stable. In the morning, the overseas silver market was flat, and the U.S. dollar rose. The forward silver price at the Precious Metals Exchange also rose by 5 hao to 1.4 li. Exchange rates rose slightly, London spot gold rose by 3.5 pence, U.S. cotton fell by 11 points, U.S. wheat rose slightly, and stocks fell slightly. A Reuters dispatch the day before yesterday stated that three U.S. senators proposed purchasing 25 million ounces of silver per month at 15% above the market price (approximately 5 jiao 4 fen), limited to purchases before April. However, because there was also news that the U.S. government had not used the $200 million equalization fund, market sentiment remained stable. The opening price of raw gold fell, but not by much. After opening, because the exchange market was not good, the gold market seemed weak. Large financial institutions bought more aggressively. Although the Canton Group continued to sell more than 2,000 gold bars, it was still able to maintain stability. In the later market, market sentiment continued to stabilize, and the domestic market was slightly tight. As a result, it was higher than last Saturday. The March futures market has not yet opened. According to the previous market, it will fall. The price of refined gold is 954 yuan. The market situation for today is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The opening price in the morning was 941 yuan 9 jiao, down 1 yuan 6 jiao from last Saturday. The price of goods opened at 2 yuan. The exchange market opened in the morning with a recent selling price of British exchange at 1 shilling 4 pence 4375, and the U.S. exchange at 34 yuan 9375. Chinese-Belgian, Zhengjin, Datong, Sumitomo, and Xianba's June U.S. dollar was at 375. Zhifeng, Yongsheng, Darong, Kang, and Xianjin rose to 3 yuan 2 jiao. Afterwards, banks were willing to offer a June U.S. dollar at 375. HSBC's listing remained unchanged. Fuchang, Yuanmao, Yongheng, Yushunmao, and Tongchun, etc., sold heavily. Mitsui set a May U.S. dollar at 3125, which fell to 1 yuan 2 jiao. Cuitai took the opportunity to buy gold bars at low prices. However, due to the heavy selling of Shengda, there was a lot of struggle. The Central Exchange Bureau ate a June U.S. dollar at 4375. Fuchang, Runchang, Yuyuan, Hengda, Xingyong, etc., came to buy, rising to 3 yuan. Cuitai sold. The Canton Group came to sell aggressively again. Zhifeng and Yong sold again. HSBC set an April U.S. dollar at 125 and a June U.S. dollar at 4375, which fell to 1 yuan 9 jiao. Hongxing and Hengyu continuously bought gold bars, which rose to 2 yuan 8 jiao. After fluctuating, the afternoon closing price was 942 yuan 6 jiao, and the price of goods was 2 yuan 8 jiao.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 942 yuan 6 jiao, and the price of goods opened at 2 yuan 5 jiao. Maijia Li set a June U.S. dollar at 4375. Yida, Yongqian, Changxiang advanced from 2 yuan 5 jiao to 3 yuan 6 jiao. Mitsui set a May U.S. dollar at 25. Fuyu, Zhifeng, Yongheng, and Xing sold to 2 yuan 9 jiao. Before long, banks suddenly wanted a March U.S. dollar at 25. Yuanmao, Yongqian, Changxiang, Xie Kang, Dadecheng all advanced. Maijia Li ate a March U.S. dollar at 25, which rose to 4 yuan 3 jiao. Wanxing and Dachangxiang sold, and the price fell slightly. Afterwards, Hengchang, Yong, Zhifeng, Yong, and Dadecheng bought again, which rose to 4 yuan 8 jiao. Tianfeng limited sales. Hengxing, Yifengyong also sold, which fell to 3 yuan 6 jiao. The closing price was 943 yuan 9 jiao, and the price of goods was 4 yuan 2 jiao. The market was relatively stable after the close. The highest price for the day was 944 yuan 8 jiao, and the lowest was 941 yuan 2 jiao, with an angle of only 3 yuan 6 jiao, which was slightly higher than last Saturday's closing price by 4 jiao.</p>
<p>The settlement price was based on HSBC Bank's U.S. exchange listing, which remained unchanged, still calculated at 34 yuan 375. The combined standard gold price was 1006 yuan. According to the closing price, it was approximately 62 yuan, which was slightly less than half a yuan less than last Saturday. The settlement price for the March period remained unchanged at 711 yuan, calculated by the exchange rate combined standard gold price. According to the closing price, it was approximately 9 yuan, which was slightly more than 2 yuan more than last Saturday. The registered price for this month was 702 yuan, April was 9437, the morning water replenishment was 702 yuan, and the afternoon was 703 yuan. The price of pure gold was calculated at 954 yuan. The situation in the market was calm, and no transactions were seen. The same was true in the later market. The central bank's appetite for absorption was not strong, and the buying price was based on the spot market price, so peers had no intention of cashing out.</p>
<p>Transactions in the market were flat. In total, Shengda, Hengxing, Shunli, Yuanchun, Sida, Yongde, Huixiang, Shunmao, etc., were on the selling side. Hengyu, Yifengyong, Hengchangyong, Hongxing, Qianchangxiang, Yuanheng, Yuanmao, Yongfu, Yuhengtai, Tongyi, Yicheng, Daxingyong, Futaiheng, etc., were on the buying side. Yuanmao and Yongcuitai advanced first and then retreated. Dadecheng and Zhifengyong retreated first and then advanced. Dalian gang Wanxing jointly did slightly more than 600, with extremely small netting. Shunli jointly did more than 400 bars, with less than 200 netting. The Canton Group's Shengda sold approximately more than 1,500 bars. Yuanmao and Yong also had account transfers. Hengxian jointly sold approximately 800, with a small number of advances. As of today, there were 16,891 April futures chips, with a total of 32 long positions and 60 short positions. The total number of transactions on the day was 19,635 in the morning and 7,294 in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The opening price for the March period was 702 yuan 6 jiao. This price was sold by Hongxing to Richang for 21 bars and Yuanshengyong for 56 bars, down 1 yuan 3 jiao from last Saturday. After entering, Yuanshengyong advanced again to 2 yuan 7 jiao. Hongxing continued to sell, gradually retreating to within 2 yuan. Yuanmaoyong advanced 35 bars, which had fallen to 1 yuan 9 jiao, and another 14 bars to 1 yuan 8 jiao. Zhaofengchang advanced to 1 yuan 7 jiao. Hongxing sold even more to Yidayong for 140 bars, retreating to 1 yuan 5 jiao. After entering, the April period rebounded. Huixiang advanced to 2 yuan 2 jiao. Yuanfengyong, etc., advanced even more to 2 yuan 5 jiao. Shen Kang came to sell (Shengda), and the shape was downstream, selling 35 bars to Yuanfengyong for 2 yuan. The afternoon closing price was 702 yuan. There was a lack of transactions in the afternoon market, and both buyers and sellers had no interest. According to the morning market, the highest price was 702 yuan 7 jiao, and the lowest price was 701 yuan 5 jiao, with a fluctuation of 1 yuan 2 jiao. As a result, the closing price was down 1 yuan 9 jiao from last Saturday. As of today, there were 20,083 March futures chips.</p>
<p>U.S. Dollar Slightly Longer, Foreign Exchange Without Special Changes</p>

After opening, the market tightened and then relaxed. HSBC Bank's listing was announced, with the British and U.S. dollars both flat. After entering, the process was calm, and the market only fluctuated. The later market rose smoothly and then tightened once, but due to the small number of transactions, there were no special changes. Until the closing price for recent sales, the British exchange was 1 shilling 4 pence 4375 and the U.S. exchange was 34 yuan 9375, which was 0.0625 tighter for the British pound and flat for the U.S. dollar compared to last Saturday.

The price of Guangdong small silver dollars was 768 yuan 6 jiao in the early market, slightly better by 1 jiao than the previous day, with 65,000 jiao in transactions. The price of copper coins also remained unchanged, still at 316,000 wen, with only over 31,000 strings in transactions, equivalent to 10,000 silver dollars.</p>
<p>Sudden Increase in Interest in Securities and Bonds Among Buyers</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, due to no changes in the environment, the Sun Rebellion had been quelled, the Tibetan Rebellion was irrelevant, and the Russo-Japanese negotiations were temporarily quiet, there was a sudden increase in purchases by large investors. In particular, No. 54 was in the greatest demand. Those who were timid in the short position also rose to cover their positions. Therefore, in the first round in the morning, there was a sudden rebound, seemingly with a grand momentum, rising 2-3 jiao to 6-7 jiao compared to the closing price on Saturday. Troop reduction also rose by half a yuan. The salt tax had returned to its previous high price, approaching 53 yuan. However, due to the excessively high market price, there was no ability to continue to rise. In the second round, Nos. 11 and 41, etc., were sold quite a bit. Although Nos. 53 and 54, etc., were still being absorbed, the market price had become chaotic, with highs and lows seen alternately. Although the number was small, it could be observed that new long positions were gradually lacking. Those who were short believed that even if it rebounded again, the danger would be at most slightly more than one yuan. Therefore, there were quite a few who released their positions. Among them, the most steadfast were the general old long positions, who had no intention of exiting. In the afternoon, the opening and closing rounds were initially flat, then slightly weak, and finally rebounded by a small 2-3 jiao. According to this salt tax returning to a high of 52 yuan 8 jiao half, it still failed to break through the 3-yuan mark. If it cannot break through again, there is a risk of breaking through the 2-yuan mark downstream. This is speculation based on market psychology, and it may be close to the truth. Yesterday's market price resulted in a consistent rebound of 3-4 jiao to 7 jiao half. The total number of transactions was 10,092,500 yuan, including 10,000 yuan in spot and 10,091,500 yuan in futures. The high and low fluctuations are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>New York Silver Stocks Close Strong</p>
<p>Proposed Purchase of 150 Million Yuan of Silver to Exchange for Surplus U.S. Agricultural Products</p>
<p>New Feng Foreign Firm's March 3rd Report: New York stock market fluctuated slightly. The opening was firm in the morning, as commercial news favored the long side, including the purchase of locomotives, etc., by the railway. Before closing, long positions took profits, and the giants returned to lows. According to Washington news, a subcommittee of the House of Representatives is now planning a proposal to have the government purchase 150 million yuan of foreign silver to exchange for surplus U.S. agricultural products. Silver stocks were therefore strong before closing, with 800,000 shares traded in half a day. "Wheat" professional speculators sold heavily, but the market absorbed it well. The market situation was stubborn and showed a higher trend. "Cotton" several parties felt that the government's purchase of excess cotton at 55% of the market price in the Punk case was weak. Also, according to reliable sources, 150 factories of British Lancashire yarn mills that use U.S. cotton will close down within the next week, and high prices can now be settled. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>
<p>|                       | Closing Price | Compared to Previous Day |</p>

<p>Yarn and Cloth Fall Rapidly</p>
<p>U.S. Cotton Turns Small: Actual Needs Stagnate</p>
<p>The yarn market is weakening, and the decline is also sharp. This situation is rare recently. Sudden rises and falls make people fall into a fog. The market sentiment is completely unstable. Therefore, the fluctuations are very large. Sales of spot yarn are quite sluggish, and new long positions lack interest. However, the base has encountered some good news, and the rise is also strong. The underlying actual needs are too small, and the market pressure is still heavy. Standard yarn fell sharply by about 2 yuan.</p>
<p>Standard Yarn: In the morning market opening, due to the decline in U.S. cotton, there were not many buyers. Each month fell by 0.8, 0.9, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 jiao. In the afternoon, each month fell again by 0.5, 0.6, 0.9 jiao to 1 yuan, 1 yuan 3 jiao. The total turnover for the day was 22,700 bales. It was found that Chunji sold 900 bales, Gengfeng 650 bales, Shenji 1,050 bales, Taichang 800 bales, and Changfeng 750 bales. Yuanda bought 950 bales, Jinchang 1,350 bales, Huikang 750 bales, Changji 1,200 bales, and Dachang 1,300 bales. The closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>|       | Standard | Highest Price | Lowest Price | Closing Price | Rise/Fall | Account Balance |</p>
<p>| ----- | ------ | ----------- | ----------- | ------------- | --------- | --------------- |</p>
<p>| March | 176.6  | 176.6       | 175.5       | 175.5         | Down 1.9  | 56,950          |</p>

<p>Yarn Sales Only Over 200 Bales</p>
<p>Sales of spot yarn are quite sluggish. Statistics show that various gangs bought a total of 245 bales throughout the day. The market was flat. The purchase volume of various gangs is as follows: Inland 127, Ningbo 2, Fujian 15, Shantou 15, Northern Gang 10, Xiamen 5, Zhenjiang 23, Guangdong 20, Peers 20, Luzhou 5.</p>
<p>The cotton market has a strong downward trend. Due to the decline in U.S. cotton, market sentiment is volatile, and scattered long positions are closing. At the same time, the cotton industry survey on the previous day showed an increase in cotton stocks in Shanghai warehouses, which made the long position sentiment weaker and the selling pressure stronger. However, the overseas cotton market is still good and no major flaws have been seen. Only the short positions are looking down, and the future depends on U.S. cotton for flexibility. Standard cotton fell by 6-7 jiao.</p>
<p>Standard Cotton: In the morning market opening, due to the decline in U.S. cotton, there were fewer buyers in the market. Each month fell by 5-6 jiao. In the afternoon, the near months fell by nearly 1.5 jiao, and the far months fell by 0.5 jiao. The total turnover for the day was 85,500 dan. It was found that Tongfu sold 5,400 dan, Chunji 3,300 dan, Dafu 1,700 dan, Changfeng 3,900 dan, Yongda 1,500 dan, Xincheng 2,000 dan, Yuanxingchang 5,200 dan, Taixing 2,300 dan, and Yichang 4,500 dan. Yuanda bought 7,400 dan, Jifeng 2,800 dan, Huikang 1,800 dan, Renfeng 3,100 dan, Tonghe 3,100 dan, Yifeng 2,300 dan, Changhe 2,300 dan, and Yicheng 1,800 dan. The closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>|       | Standard | Highest Price | Lowest Price | Closing Price | Rise/Fall | Account Balance |</p>
<p>| ----- | ------ | ----------- | ----------- | ------------- | --------- | --------------- |</p>
<p>| March | 42.40  | 42.40       | 42.15       | 42.15         | Down 0.06  | 135,700         |</p>

<p>Consumption of Raw Cotton is Extremely Weak</p>
<p>The demand for spot cotton is sluggish. The source is estimated to be 50 bales of Yaohua and 150 bales of Tonghua. The current cotton prices are as follows: Lingbao Cotton 48.50. Gongda Factory Imported 83 pieces. Spot delivery to the factory.</p>
<p>The Reason for the Weakness of Indian Cotton Last Week</p>
<p>Long positions took profits... Speculators sold</p>
<p>Last week, due to a large number of long positions taking profits and speculators selling due to unfavorable U.S. cotton news, the market situation was weak. At the same time, the business report was also insufficient to attract buyers. Foreign demand was not smooth. Exports to Europe were very few. China bought slightly. Japanese buyers took a cautious attitude. New cotton arrivals were very high, and stocks were sufficient, especially Oumula. It is hoped that relief can be provided in March and April, as it is reported that Japan's export volume in March and April may increase. The statistics for last week are as follows (unit: 1,000 bales):</p>
<p>|                                      | 1933   | 1934   |</p>

<p>Grain: Government Wheat Reported to be Sold Again</p>
<p>Standard Flour Rises and Then Falls Back</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, each share presented a stable and strong appearance. The quoted price of foreign wheat in Chicago rebounded by 1 jiao, and Canada rebounded by 4-5 points. The market speculated that the market price had fallen to a low level, and short positions mostly engaged in hedging or turned into long positions. Therefore, the market sentiment was initially flat after the opening, and then gradually rebounded. The market sentiment for each month saw a good trend. However, there was still no large-scale outlet in terms of actual sales, so the increase was only about 1 fen. Until the opening of the afternoon market, it was initially stable, and then it was reported that the government wheat had sold another ship at a price of 4 yuan, fixed by Fufeng. Therefore, the market had a cashing out, but the number was not smooth, and the market was still little affected. According to the government's cheap wheat, the future situation is ultimately feared to be difficult to improve. As a result, this month was better by 1 fen 2.5 li than the previous week, April and May were better by 1 fen, June was better by 5 li, and July was better by 7.5 li.</p>
<p>Distant Wheat is Quietly Firm</p>
<p>March, April, and May Have No Transactions</p>
<p>Yesterday's period wheat market, after the opening in the morning and afternoon, the market situation for each month was generally stable. The quoted price of foreign wheat in Chicago was better by 1 jiao, and Canada was better by about 48 points. The market sentiment was stable after the opening, but the near-term months had no meaning in buying or selling. There were no transactions in March, April, and May throughout the day. For the distant months, the flour market was stable, and market sentiment was also firm. Because it was new wheat, relevant peers did not dare to take action until they were sure of the annual harvest. Therefore, there were not many transactions, and the price was slightly better. As a result, June and July were better by 3 fen, and August was better by 1 fen. The spot wheat market price remained stable, with Kaifeng Jiangbei wheat at 3 yuan 4 jiao 7 fen</p>

<p>Film Special: On the Filming of Aviation Films (Part 1) by Ling Zhen</p>
<p>In films with air combat as the backdrop, we often see many thrilling scenes of airplane battles. These thrilling scenes not only increase the tension of the plot but also make the audience find them very exciting to watch. However, the filming of these scenes requires a special aviation film shooting method. I believe that many people are interested in knowing about the aspects related to shooting aviation films.</p>
<p>In the United States, major film companies all have airfields and airplane fleets, and they employ fearless daredevils. However, recently they have been gradually phased out. The thrilling scenes they could create no longer feel scary to the audience. What they want to see are thrilling aerial scenes. Therefore, the companies have hired new fearless people who can create thrilling scenes in the sky, thousands of feet above the ground.</p>
<p>When filming scenes on the ground of speeding trains or other vehicles, the camera's rotation speed can be manipulated appropriately. This can make a vehicle that isn't actually moving very fast appear to be speeding. Furthermore, some scenes that aren't actually very dangerous can be transformed into incredibly shocking scenes through cinematography. And the cameraman doesn't feel any particular difficulty. Filming aerial movies is different. Sometimes, the camera is mounted on one airplane to film another. The cameraman on this airplane must not only constantly adjust the camera, but also constantly pay attention to whether the airplane being filmed is in the lens and whether the light in the sky is appropriate. Furthermore, because both airplanes are flying in the sky, it is not easy for the cameraman to position themselves effectively, and the fact that airplanes flying in the sky are not as stable as on the ground also increases the cameraman's difficulty. Therefore, an inexperienced cameraman cannot shoot good aviation films.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a screenwriter writes an aviation film with many thrilling scenes. For them, it is very easy; as long as they use their vivid writing and flexible mind, they can create many thrilling aviation scenes on paper. However, when these scenes are turned into movies, it takes a great deal of effort, especially in terms of cinematography. Many aviation films have excellent plots, and if they also have a good cameraman to handle the filming, who can pay attention to the angle of the camera and can transform scenes that are not very thrilling into incredibly shocking scenes through good cinematography. Conversely, some thrilling scenes, because the cameraman's filming method is not appropriate, will make the audience feel not thrilled at all. From this, we can see that the creation of thrilling scenes in aviation films occupies a very important part in cinematography.</p>
<p>Before a cameraman starts filming an aviation scene, they must first decide on the filming plan, measure the distance between the two airplanes, and calculate this distance very accurately, so that it is exactly the distance that should be used for this scene. Then, they decide on the angle at which the camera should be placed. Under certain circumstances, what angle should be used to film so that the filmed result looks good? After making these decisions, they inform the pilot of the airplane carrying the camera in detail, and within a certain period of time, they arrange their airplane according to the determined position and distance. Then, the cameraman uses their skillful filming techniques to complete this aviation scene. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Audience Opinion: After Watching "The Angry Tide of the China Sea" by Xiao Man</p>
<p>The subject matter adopted by "The Angry Tide of the China Sea," for us people in a semi-colonial land, especially in the current emergency period of active aggression by various imperialist powers, is undoubtedly capable of giving a profound impression; but because of certain reasons, the original form of this film has been lost, thus distorting some places in its intention, and at the same time, the effect cannot have its original and due power. This is naturally not the responsibility of the author of the film, so we should not only not be critical of the shortcomings of the publicly screened film, but also have considerable sympathy. At the same time, if the viewer can carefully watch, they can still see the main intention of the author and get a fairly profound feeling and impression. The director and actors have considerable power in this effect. The most obvious are Qin Tong, who plays Jiao Da, and Yuan Meiyun, who plays A Ju, who always maintain that gloomy and sorrowful face, which can be said to give a full expression of the kind of life they have lived. This is very rare; because the performance on the screen is often intermittent, sometimes the performance of this scene is even a long time apart from the other scene, in this case, it is quite difficult for an actor's performance to be unified and consistent.</p>
<p>This film also has some shortcomings in terms of technique. The important thing is that Su's performance of throwing herself into the water is not enough; just using two lines of tears is not enough to express such a serious and tense scene, so that the audience feels that she is about to commit suicide. Also, the light shining on A Ju at that time was a bit too strong, not very harmonious with the mood at that time; the light on the water at that time was not like moonlight. In addition, when A Ju was rescued, she stated that she was raped to the crowd, the screen began to show from the time Xiao Rong secretly got up, which is not only a bit unreasonable, but also has a considerable damage to the development of the whole play; the directing technique is also a bit clumsy. In addition, the handling of the crowd scene is not brilliant, the most obvious is the crowd scene in Jiao Da's home, how tense it should be at that time! This effect cannot be produced by a few people. Also, only placing the crowd on a plane, without thinking about using high and low levels, is quite weakening the power of expression and is damaging the beauty of the picture.</p>
<p>Film Review: Review of "Green Shadows of Spring" by Luo Ping</p>
<p>Aa HusbandGo | Greater Shanghai</p>
<p>Should a bourgeois woman have a lover at the same time as she has a husband? If she already has a lover, then how should she deal with this love triangle?</p>
<p>Originally, in modern society, women have been liberated from the dark Middle Ages, although this liberation is very limited; society has recognized that women have the same legal status as men, although in practice these are all nice empty words. Therefore, the love between the sexes seems to be built on the basis of the free will of both parties. Naturally, it is very common for a woman to have a husband and not be able to forget her old lover, and there is no way to criticize it.</p>
<p>The problem is that this constitutes a love triangle, and the one who feels the most pain is naturally the one who is trapped. How will he or she relieve their pain?</p>
<p>Lu Xue'er is one who is full of contradictions in her heart. In front of her husband, she suggests that her lover pretend to be the lover of her girlfriend; when her husband discovers her secret, she knows that he still loves her very warmly.</p>
<p>Things are very coincidental, her husband and her lover get along very well, and they actually become bosom friends.</p>
<p>Her lover is also very painful for this love triangle, he and Charlie talk very speculatively after fishing together, and several times he painfully wants to tell Charlie his secret love.</p>
<p>Although he did not really tell Charlie, the friendship between the two of them has been seen by Lu Xue'er, and finally he feels that he should sacrifice himself to fulfill the love between Charlie and Lu Xue'er.</p>
<p>"Green Shadows of Spring" is such a comedy ending, and the playwright cleverly uses the success of Emily's daughter and Hipsey's love to strengthen its comedy atmosphere.</p>
<p>However, "Green Shadows of Spring" is ultimately a meaningless love triangle farce, and does not raise a reasonable solution to the relationship between the sexes.</p>
<p>Impressions of the Soviet Union by a Comedian Star by Li Ren</p>
<p>Harpo Marx, one of the famous Marx Brothers of Hollywood, not long ago, we learned from the Moscow Daily that he went to the Soviet Union to perform. He has now returned to the United States. According to a news reporter who interviewed him, his impression of the Soviet Union is quite interesting. He said, "If you're not afraid, it's a great life there." Then someone asked him if he had converted to communism, and he answered very cleverly. He said that he didn't pay much attention to this, and he was busy converting to Vodka and Caviar. We know that Marx was welcomed by the Soviet government. If the government can entertain its guests and be busy converting to wine and food, this kindness is not thin at all. At the same time, the Soviet Union is busy with the second five-year plan, and being able to entertain guests with a feast, its economy and life can also prove to be quite improved.</p>
<p>"I had a little trouble getting into Russia," Harpo said. "I was detained somewhere on the border, and according to the map, the ending of the place name is called something Ski (SKI). I brought a lot of props for the performance, including three hundred small knives, a bunch of fake hair, a harp, a gasoline can, and a car horn.</p>
<p>"The officials thought I was crazy, and I thought they would put me in the cellar, but we talked for a long time. After I signed thirty applications, I was no longer in danger, and they let me pass."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir," Harpo continued, "Russia is a particularly big place. As for the food? My God, sometimes I wade in caviar, and the supply of vodka is also endless. But you just need vodka, it's really cold there."</p>
<p>Marx was particularly interested in the Soviet theater, and he thought that the rest of the world was nothing compared to it. He said that they have nine months of rehearsal time before their premiere.</p>
<p>Marx put on a fine wool goatskin coat, put on a Russian fur hat, and the children on the street jokingly called him Eskimo. He thought this was very interesting. (The End)</p>

<p>Film Novel: Two Against One (Part 4) by Quan Bai</p>
<p>Surrounded by smoke and wine, they and Jia Lu were already drunk. Jiefu also urged everyone to drink, and winked at Luo Na. So Luo Na leaned on Jia Lu, calling him to drink this glass of wine, and promising to sing a "Promise of My Heart" song for him. Jia Lu gulped down the wine in her hand again. So Luo Na sang:</p>
<p>"Spring comes quietly, spring goes without a trace, I want to keep spring but spring has gone, only leaving a haggard and pitiful bug! Remember, remember the accidental meeting, my heart has been promised, do you know? The fiery feelings are as sweet as honey! Flowing water and fallen flowers, you are like water, unintentionally in love with a floating tumbleweed, my heart is empty in vain! I only hope that your heart will turn, hand in hand, cherish the morning glory, and be happy together until old age!" || (Wang Qianbai wrote the song, Xuan Jinglin sang.)</p>
<p>After she finished singing, everyone clapped their hands, and Jia Lu also clapped his hands. Luo Na asked him if she sang well? He just nodded repeatedly, embracing Luo Na weakly, and laughing uncontrollably. He also saw a group of modern women like Shao Fen, so he called them to sing one too. Li Yun thought of something, so she also advocated singing a "Seize the Moment of Pleasure" song together. Jia Lu, Weida, and Xu Jian all clapped their hands and welcomed it, so they sang:</p>
<p>"What is love? Some say it is pain, some say it is happiness; what is love? Burn! Fire of youth; flower fragrance is easy to fade, moon shadow has been desolate, come on! come on! Drink a glass of red wine, sing a sweet song; life is like a dream, how long is human life? Let's seize the moment of pleasure, don't wait for the spring to grow old, and say in vain that we have wasted time!" || (Wang Qianbai wrote the song, Yan Yuejian, Zhu Qiuhen, Gu Meijun, Gu Lanjun and others sang together.)</p>
<p>The sunlight has slowly come out from the east. But Jia Lu and his group, some were sleeping on the sofa, some were sleeping on the floor, and they were vomiting all around, they forgot about today's ball game.</p>
<p>For the international football match, the central football field was already full of people, and the Huaguang team represented China in the competition. The game started, and all the Huaguang team members were still not sober from their hangovers. The ball only went around on the Huaguang side. Suddenly, the whole field was in an uproar, because Jia Lu kicked into the air, and the ball had been shot towards the goal, but fortunately it was saved by a player. Ai Hua, who was sick on the viewing platform, was so anxious that sweat was pouring down. Xu Jian was injured, and the Huaguang team fought with ten people, and Jia Lu was knocked to the ground. The ball had flowed into the net. Jiefu and Luo Na signaled to each other happily. Ai Hua was so anxious that she vomited blood from her mouth and fainted on the ground. At this time, Shao Fen couldn't help but feel guilty, and besides, she originally loved Weida. Regardless of everything, she helped Ai Hua to the players' rest area, and repented to the players, explaining the conspiracy of Jiefu and his group. The players were stimulated and greatly moved, and they all became excited.</p>
<p>In the second half of the game, due to the efforts of the Huaguang team members, the scoreboard changed from 0-1 to 1-1. The whole audience shouted wildly to cheer for Huaguang. In the last three minutes, Weida got a ball and passed it to Jia Lu. Jia Lu raised his foot and kicked, and the ball went into the net. The whole field was immediately like a landslide and earth split. When the notary finished blowing the whistle to end the game, on the scoreboard, the Huaguang team had created a record of 2-1.

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry has submitted a request to the National Economic Council to allocate 30 million yuan from the U.S. cotton loan earmarked for water conservancy for the Yangtze River waterway improvement and dredging costs. A detailed plan is now being drafted. The first phase of the project includes (1) excavating reservoirs and (2) constructing water diversion dams. It is currently proposed to first dredge Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake to serve as reservoirs for the Yangtze River. The two lakes can accommodate a large amount of water, so that it will not flow into the Yangtze River. In recent years, the floodwaters have all flowed into the lakes. To prevent river disasters, it is necessary to first dredge Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake. Regarding the construction of water diversion dams, dams will be built on the banks of the river where the river surface is wide and the water flow is slow, so that the river channel can be contained, and then the long flow will inevitably speed up, and the waterway will naturally become deeper. The committee plans to expand its organization slightly in the future and recruit construction department or water conservancy experts from the relevant provincial governments along the river to serve as members. This matter is under discussion and has not yet been decided. However, after the entire plan for improving the Yangtze River waterway is drafted, a plenary committee will be convened to make a final decision and submit it to the National Economic Council.

After the materials are collected, a systematic plan will be drafted and submitted to the central government for adoption within two months. Furthermore, it is believed that high silver prices will easily lead to bankruptcy in rural areas.

<p>Tokyo dispatch on the 4th: Japan will soon submit a bill to the Diet stipulating that the Bank of Japan should purchase gold produced in the Japanese Empire.

The government will bear the loss between all purchase prices and the statutory price and list it as a loan from the government to the bank, but without interest. The amount is limited to 100 million yuan. If the government needs gold to pay for foreign exchange, it may withdraw gold at the bank's purchase price. If there is a profit, it will offset the previous loss. The government will pay interest on the funds used by the bank to purchase gold on behalf of the government, at the same rate as the banknote tax. It is reported that the total gold produced in the Japanese Empire last year was 13,492,000 grams, an increase of about 10% compared to 1932.</p>
