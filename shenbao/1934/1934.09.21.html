<h3 id="c33">利用外資開發四川敬 <a href="#c33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>利用外資開發四川礦業之說。社會喧騰己久。頃據報載聚興誠銀行總經理楊燦三氏所發表之談話。則知同英借欵一說。非全無據。但楊氏謂。此次對英接洽。與歷來利用外資之性質不同。第一純屬私人接洽。不涉政治意味。第二先行設立金融公司。并不直接向産業投資。以免外人干預之弊。第三。無擔保品。借欵還欵可以自由。第四不許其有獨占性質。吾人準據上述消息。尚有不能無疑者。</p>
<p>夫英人之善於經營。産業。久爲舉世所共知。其於殖民地經濟組織之規劃。尤稱巨孹。方其經營印度之始。非假手於私人事業之東印度公司乎。迨印度卽入英商國之經濟掌握後。英人始委派總督。以統治全印之政治。又如一九一四年世界大戰之前。英人頗擬以南非爲出發點。而建築所謂三Ｃ鐵路綫以實行其抱負。幹綫起自好望角。經開羅以迄印度之加爾各塔。而其延長綫則穿越西藏。循江而東。以至上海。好望角開羅與加爾各塔間之聯絡綫。以經濟價值不高。故戰後卽寂焉無聞。惟印度方面之經營。則殊稱積極。其對西藏之着着緊逼。尤未見絲臺鬆手。四川之地方軍人。鬩牆鬥。爭歷有年所。其目力所及。端爲各人權位。其於國際關係之了解認識。詎足爲深謀老算之英人作對手。至於兩國之私人的經濟關係。在等於次殖民地之中國。亦焉有平等之可言。舉凡一般所重視之法律規範與契約束縛。在國際間必須雙方國力平衡。始堪運用。否則等於具文而己。東北旣往之嚴重敎訓。可爲吾人殷鑒。此吾人在楊氏解釋之餘。猶不能無疑者。一也。</p>
<p>至謂金融公司之組織。純處於放欵之監督地位。而並不直接參加産業組織任何實業團體之股東。可以委託該公司經手募集資金。將來則僅由其稽核用途云云。固似言之有理。殊不知近代金融資本之組織多屬於股票管理性質。非必由金融家直接管理産業也。各國之産業家。莫不低首下心。服從少數金融資本家之指。揮而有無可奈何之嘆。此在先進諸國。尚且如是。以我國産業幼穉。而又缺乏組織訓練之産業資本。設不務集團競爭。而僅利用零星的私人關係。其能免於被動者所通嘗之痛苦耶。此不能無疑者。二也。</p>
<p>楊氏對於不許獨占性存立之解釋。以爲募集資金雖委託英人。但應募之人。則並未制限其國籍。任何國人皆可投資。殊不知金融公司旣以英人爲主。其募集資金地點。自當以倫敦爲先。不足則由其他英國各城市及自治領殖民地輔之。在此類區域内。英國固居於絶對的支配者之地。位間有他國人士之加入。亦祇有聽從其領導。殆勢所必然者也。至由金融資本之優越地位。而形成經濟的獨占。尤爲當今不可否認之事實。然則不許獨占之說。又鮮有存在之餘地。此不能無疑者。三也。</p>
<p>我國處此上下交困之秋。利用外資。以開發本國之富源，固爲計之上者。然言夫利用外資。至少應分别事業之緩急。認識人我之關係。其間利害得失。務須以國家民族之福利爲權衡。絶對摒除私利之觀念。然後乃成有利益可言。四川之天産較富。而工業猶未發達。對於國家將來。實具有巨大貢獻之潛勢力。允宜有整個具體計劃。在中央指導監督之下。公開辦理。庶可收獲（交相利）之效。蓋在投資者方面。固可爲私人之投資。而在我方則旣着眼於公共福利。亦差足副民生主義中大産業國營之主旨。不然。則利未見而弊先至矣。</p>

<p>日人心目中的列强</p>
<p>外交政策上的準備</p>
<p>所謂一九三六年的危機、是日本首先唱出來的、並且竭力用人工加深其程度、現在一九三六年眞快臨頭了、倫敦的海軍預備會議第一次失敗後、前途暗淡、未許樂觀、日本在這時候、海軍軍人蓄意　預、可是在外交上還是相當的注意、再不肯像以往的陷於世界孤立的苦境中、據海軍當局對華盛頓·倫敦兩條約、分析當世主要四國的主張如下、</p>
<p>（一）她以爲英國對倫敦海軍條約及華盛頓海約、就（量）的方面而論、並没有要變更的意思、甚至在原則上還打算繼續該約、不過在質的方面有兩種意見、一種是攺現在三萬五千噸的主力艦爲二萬五千噸、載砲口徑也同樣縮小、一種是增加英國現有的重巡洋艦和輕巡洋艦、由五十艘添到七十艦、</p>
<p>（二）美國是華盛頓條約的發起國、主要的意見是維持該兩項條約、對英國的主張也大不相同、縮小主力艦噸數於英國有利、於美國恰相反、增加巡洋艦也是一樣的使美國退民被動地位、所以她主張海軍條約延期、或者就現有勢力再行减縮、（三）法國對英美的主張本無所偏袒、卽對日本的關係也非嘗常輕微、她所要的祇是對意大利、表面法意之間主力艦和航空母艦是平等的、但法國海軍實質上是佔優勢、因此她不願卽行廢除海約、</p>
<p>（四）意大利祇要名義和法國海軍相平等就滿足了、因爲她財政很困難、而且她殖民地也有限、海上發展僅在於地中海、假如海軍條約廢止了、各國起而競造海軍、意國當感到應付的困難、所以並不贊成廢止海約、</p>
<p>照上述分析、主要各國都不贊助廢止海約、日本豈不要陷於兩難的地位、不過她以爲英美之間是很難調和、她就利用英美的不調和、極力從中破壞、務必使她們恊同一致的新提案提不出來、同時更嚴密注意英美的態度、現在日本的策略是不論上述四國的意見何如、不管預備會議是否能够成功、她都要提出廢止華盛頓、倫敦兩條約的議案、</p>
<p>其積極主張是第一認爲華盛頓條約第二十三條、關於比率主義的、須行廢止、至於提示廢止時期最合適是本年十二月三十一日以前、第二要確立國防的安全、迅速脫離旣成的不利條約的束縛、由國家生存權之絶對平等出發、而締結新的軍縮條約、須澈底廢除某一個國家保持高度的軍備、及軍備的優越性、所以今後應卽廢止差等比率、尊重各國的國防自主權實以總噸數爲標準、以縮减海軍軍備、這是日本政府現時所倡的高調、就目前日本國内一般情勢觀察、决不許其再引起對英美的海軍建艦競爭、其實是以這類高調去抵制牽涉治問題、坐實她在遠東的覇權、隠隠中去分化英美、我們看日本外部動員在歐美各主要國的外交官、近更公然的訓伶他們、令其向駐在國陳述、（一）日本誠意維持世界和平、並欲减輕其國民負擔、實行軍縮、（二）日本有意縮小航空母艦及主力艦等攻擊性武器、（三）日本認華府條約的比率主義不適時宜、所以主張英·美·日·軍備平等、並主張各國都以總噸數爲主、而再行軍縮、如此外交手段的運用、意在取得英·法·意·的同情、至少是法意的好感、然而她很明白、這個工作是很不容易成就的、必須出全方去應付、所以由外部發起組織軍縮情報委員會、以輔佐對軍縮的進行、該委員會由外部情報司長天羽及課長二人、海部海軍普及委員長野田及大佐二名、陸軍調查委員髭工藤及新差班長等共同組織、每週開會一次、専門從事於情報工作、並切實與駐在各國的日本武官外交官聯絡、指示他們現在的需要、和應注意之點、將這些消息綜合起來、以籌劃對軍縮的策略、（一九三四年九月十四日於東京）</p>

<p>據孔氏談、關於美國參議院軍火貿易調查委員會宣佈、杜邦軍火公司駐華代表之函件、據謂、曾以軍火售予中國、若干中國官塲人干、及將官、均得有佣金云云、蔣委員長及汪院長、對此頗爲注意、業由外交部訓令駐美公使施肇基氏、照會美國外交部、要求該國參議院軍火貿易調查委員會主席奈埃、將杜帮公司駐華代表函件内所稱曾得佣金之中國官塲人士、及將官之姓名、卽予公佈、如果確係事實、當卽嚴予澈究、至於該會主席奈埃宣稱、中國曾以美國棉麥借欵二千萬美金、向意大利調换軍火云云、全非事實、我國向美國所借之棉麥及麵粉、先後運滬出售、所得現欵、均交由全國經委會全部用於建設用途、事實俱在、可以證明、若謂我國曾向意國購買軍火、而卽指係挪用美國棉麥借欵、殊屬荒謬、君等設若見余購買一毛錢之花生、而能卽指謂此一毛錢、偷自中央銀行乎、此種不實之談話、出自美國參議院軍火貿易調查委員會主席之口、殊屬遺憾、</p>

<p>上海縣政府前據各區公所塡報、本年度應浚河道、計達五十餘處、祇以經濟無着、施行爲難、乃於第三屆縣政會議時、議請在原征八分保衛畝捐下、劃撥二分、攺充水利經費、經再三請求結果、昨己奉准以一分五厘劃充水利専欵、惟河多費微、進行仍難、前日第二次建設委員會議時、提出討論、當决議將建費餘欵、悉數撥充征工浚河費用、以利實施、茲縣府己將本年度浚河計劃方案擬就、此後當可逐步開浚、次第進行矣、茲將計劃略述於后、</p>
<h3 id="c135">擬浚河道 <a href="#c135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>本年度内擬浚河道、據各區公所塡報、有鶯寳河等五十餘條全長百餘里、己除鶯寳河業己呈准専案書、征臨時畝捐、現己派員施測外、其餘各河、長共一百華里左右、雖寬狹修短不一、其勘測征伕施工管理等項　要屬相同、</p>
<h3 id="c136">施工程序 <a href="#c136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>按照修正江蘇省各縣征工浚河規程第工條之規定、本縣境内征工浚河事宜、應由本縣建設委員會建議、並監督、所有測勘設計預算、均應由本縣主管建設人員、負責辦理、至征夫施工、凡工程較大、出方在十萬公方以上者、得設立征工疏浚某某河工程事務所、受縣長及主管建設人員之指揮、負責辦理、其較小工程、即由縣長主管建設人員、直接指揮有關各區長辦理、本縣本年度内、擬浚河道、亦由本府於上月派員分别前往測量、約須於本年十月底勘測完竣、然後繪製圖表、計算土方水方、並造具築壩戽水經費預算、一併呈送建設廳核示、十一月中旬農忙己逝、浦潮枯落、即可按照計劃圖表、招工築壩斷流、戽去積水、於十二月初一律開工、至征夫派工事宜、其工程較大、但有河工事務所者、由該事務所負責辦理其未組事務所者、由各該管區公所負責辦理、統限於十一月底一律辦理完竣、以免延誤施工出限、</p>

<p>征工浚河經費　按照修正江蘇省各縣征工浚河規程第十一條之規定、除築壩戽水費用、及荒區口糧費、按照實地情形編造外、其他測勘設備管理等一切費用、應以每公里二十元至五十元爲度、如設立工程事務所、其所需經費、即包括在内、本縣去年度擬浚河道、據各區公所塡報、達百餘華里之多、（約合六十公里）每公里平均以四十元計算、計需測勘設備管理等費二千四百元、其他築壩戽水修橋等費、須俟測勘完竣後、方可編擬、茲姑以每公里七十元計算、共需洋四千二百元、兩共需洋六千六百元、而本縣本年度内可征水利經費、僅三千餘元、建費餘欵、（建費總數内除有指定用途者外）爲數亦僅一千餘元、即悉數撥充、亦祇足征浚四十公里河道之需、查修正江蘇省各縣征工浚河實施細則第五案之規定、每縣每年征工浚疏之河道、其長以二十公里至五十公里爲度、本縣面積狹小、人口稀少、而本年度擬疏浚河道、據各區公所塡報、達六十餘公里之多、己超過最高規定、故爲顧全事實計、尚須减少至四十公里之必要云云、</p>

<p>上海畜植牛奶公司、爲先施公司總監督馬應彪君所經營、開辦迄今、己達十餘載成績驚人、該公司主張欲挽回利權、須先獲得國人之信仰、故不惜數十萬巨資、先後在江灣及吳淞設置最新式最完備之牛棚、竭力注意牛隻方面、健康、早經上海工部局發給Ａ宇頭等執照、按最近檢查之結果、該公司吳淞分塲之牛隻、無一頭染有肺癆者、實開本埠空前紀錄、近更向加拿大聘到著名獸醫飛利浦氏、爲生産部主任、親加監護牛隻及一切衛生方面之工作、所産牛奶、均用最新式之Ｐasteurizing機器、加以消毒、牛奶經此機製過後、可以冷飲、不必再加煮沸、以免滋養料减少、</p>
<p>欲得國人之信仰、除由衛生方面着乎外、牛奶之品質、亦極注意、該公司之牛隻、大部份購自美國、大部份爲Ｇuernsey種、故該公司之牛奶、特别濃厚、奶油成份、平均爲百分之四·六、較衛生局標凖高過百分之卅一、本埠國人旋知該公司之可靠、飲户己增加至三千餘户、其爲社會推許、可見一斑、</p>

<p>丨丨答袁慶炎君</p>
<p>以上將對於職業的態度約略說過了，但同時對於人的態度，對於同事的態度也不能不注意。否則，你仍不能正確的應付你的職業。編者</p>
<p>其次是對人的態度。人總是社會的。社會又是受着當時經濟發達的階段决定的。人有進步的，也有保守的。一個對社會很有認識的人固然值得欽佩，但是一個混混噩噩，或者油腔滑調的人也不必表示如何厭棄。因爲這不僅是他們個人賢不肖的問題，整個都是由於環境造成的。我們自己清醒了，不獨不應鄙棄他們，反應回想自己，在不清醒前不也是一樣的糊塗蟲麽？我們與他們終不過百步五十步之差罷了。有何高傲之有？你正應該抱孫中山先生態度，自己先知了，你要去覺後知才對。你要想法子去唤醒他們，說服他們，帮助造成他清醒的條件，不應讓他老睡。這方是正確的態度。你不能如此，己經是不對了。你一人獨醒，即令你有天大的本領，又能成就一件什麽事呢？你有高尚的理想，你看不起甲，又看不起乙，你的左右的人，你都對他冷淡，好像他們都與你有敵意了似的，你至於憎恨你的周圍無論那一個人，天啊，那高尚的理想還有什麽用處？它在地卜是不能生長的，祇得在你的幻想裹存在。這是何等嚴重的錯誤呢？這不是明明離開了現實了嗎？現實是醜惡的，現社會有病症，大家現在都到没有出路了個人的出路要以大家的出路爲前提，所以我們要個個人清醒，來共同攺造，現在你們想天下人個個都與你一樣，一不如意，就離開了他們，這種行爲，不是與醉生夢死的人一般無二嗎？並且你果能眞的離開他們嗎？不能的。現在不清白的人不僅你那米行，到處都是一樣，你憎恨他們，同時會要憎恨社會一切人，你會要變爲（狂人日記）（魯迅著）的主人翁了。你眞的要離開他們，同時你非離開生活不可，這是逃避不了的呀！你就做了和尚，也許你理想中的和尚要高過現實的和尚，你又要再逃了。</p>

<p>（四）金氏政策之影響</p>
<p>金文泰先生雖爲英國人、因爲居留東方頗久、曾任香港總督、對於中國語言文字、也有研究、英政府以馬來亞重任付與、本來很適當的、金氏對中國和中國人、論理應有深刻的認識、不過我們由金氏取締馬來亞中國國民黨一件事聯想到一九二五年的（省港罷工）風潮、很覺很金氏所施的政策、每每發生不幸的影響、英政府設施、素有聰明穏健的聲譽、可惜這種笨拙而危險的政策、竟然由金氏發現、這不能不令人追述的、那一次風潮發生正值中國國民黨執政廣州、金氏感懷往事、就此存了若干芥蒂、亦未可料、因果相關、耐人尋味、但我們應知世界人類和一切生物、都有其生存權、在共同生存的局面之下、祇有互助互賴、如果單　一種强力壓制一切、則不平之氣、無法宣洩、小則發生風波、大而至於潰决、這是我們對金氏政策影響所憂慮的第一點、華僑人數旣多知識自有不齊、從前僑界社會、分門别第、時有爭鬥、自國民黨成立後、對此種紛爭、常能出而排解與勸止、史實昭著、馬來亞人士、無不知之、國民黨之存在與華僑社會不無影響、且馬來亞中國國民黨未被取締以前、三民主義的信仰、樹立在華僑腦子裏面　共産主義及其他危險思想侵不進來、國民黨黨員的行動光明正大、一望而知、十幾年來在海外從未使到居留政府發生困難、自從金氏取締國民黨活動、共産黨反乘機活動起來、秘密煽惑、無孔不入、最近赤化勢力、聽說己蔓延到馬來亞的鑛山農塲、殖民地政府對國共黨人難以辨别、其危險就防不勝防、這是我們對金氏政策影響所憂慮的第二點、</p>

<h3 id="c195">文化落後與出版界的生産過剩 <a href="#c195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— 因明</p>
<p>正如中國是個經濟落後的國家同時發生生産過剩一樣，中國是一個文化落後的國家，同時也發生出版界的生産過剩。我們過去在大公司大商店看見甚麽春季大廉價秋季大廉價的招牌，廣告，現在也輪到出版界了。看看吧，商務，中華，世界，開明，北新······幾乎整個上海的出版界不是都在舉行大傾銷，大競賣嗎？而且委託郵局代購書籍雜誌，銀行免費匯欵，一切競銷的辦法，應有盡有。這不是生産過剩期中特有的現象嗎？</p>
<p>出版界眞的生産過剩超過了中國人的需要嗎？恐怕谁也不能這樣說吧！實際考察起來，一般出版物中，除敎科書而外。就是十分通俗合於大衆的讀物，每版能印上萬册，一年能銷幾版的，眞是微乎其微。至於稍高深一點的理論讀物，每版印數不過一千册至二千册，往往還三四年才銷一版。以號稱人口四萬萬，有五千年文化史的中國，僅僅容受這一點兒知識産品，我們能够說是生産過剩嗎？</p>
<p>就以我們東鄰來說，人口不過六千萬，也版物中，數年間銷至數十版或數百版的，十分尋常。無怪乎我們受人家侵凌，單以這一點說來，我們就落後得太遠了。</p>
<p>這種落後（也可以說是不足）與過剩的矛盾現象，原因何在呢？據我的觀察，如經濟落後與生産過剩一般，主要的不外下列二者··（一）文化落後本身。一般的文化落後，有讀書能力的實在大少，幾乎全國都是文盲，以致容受知識産品的容量太低，在微少的出版品中就不免還要發生過剩了。（二）經濟恐慌的影響。比較能讀書購書的，大多是小資産階級的知識份子，年來我國外受民界經濟恐慌的影響，農村及城市中小階級，均師破産，一般知識份子失學失業，謀生不遑，那裏還有餘力來購置書籍，出版物怎能不感覺過剩？</p>
<p>原來文化産品就是文人的商品（自然這中間還有一層書賈的剥削，文人之於書賈，亦不過工人之於資本家而己），商品滯銷要影響到工廠關門和工人失業，文化工人當然也不能例外。</p>
<p>在這種狀態下知識份子的第一個避難所是敎育界，可是敎育界早己宣告破産了。最後又比較困難的一個避難所，是出版界，而出版界的情形又是如此。有人說今年知識階級走到末路，這話雖不全對，大槪所差也無幾了吧。</p>

<p>— 希雋</p>
<p>九月的夢是輕的，輕得像離枝的葉子那麽不載重。正是一個最適宣於相思的季節呵！雖說眼前的一株草，一朶花，都己在短籬邊悄悄地憔悴下去，淡淡的結着凋謝的怨悉；但是白色的菊花却迎着温暖的陽光漸次地綻開。</p>
<p>一種輕烟般矇矓的悵惘，爬上心坎，又爬了過去。這麽一來就不知怎的長起一些惋惜的情緒來。像暗地裏有了什麽東西牽住了我似的。因此我的心，我的思念，己離開了此地，有同一雙凌空的燕子，飛過重重的山和重重的海，到那遼遠的明朗的理想的天邊。雖然我的身子是被現境所覇絆而不得不滯留着。而整個的靈魂可日夜陶醉在異國的夢境中。縱使這兒的景物能够多在腦袋上留一下，多給我一點温美親熱的感覺，也終是最後的時間了。是的，也並不是這兒的一切完全没的呌我留戀的地方，對於這九月的澄藍的天，迷人的季候夢，重疊在籐架上累累遲熟的血紅的紫葡萄，微笑似的令人可愛，尚且曾經伴着心慕的女人絮語於葡萄架間，肩偎着肩，一同數着天空的星珠子；哼着甜密的雷夢娜曲。</p>
<p>然而這一段軟的生活迅速地消逝了。正同每朶花一樣盛開了，又萎謝了。况且秋風在北國己是冰柱凝結的時候。還會有從雪地上出現着桃色的影子麽？於是我默然了，乾脆地撇去了那些過去的事。惓念没有，太息没有，眼涙更没有，把心裏生了根的東西，一個勁兒全摘了下來，扔在腦袋後，頭也不回。我己另外懷着憧憬，代替了舊時的一切。</p>
<p>我憧憬办邦的流浪，我尤神往於那咖啡座中温雅秀妙而多情的侍女，跟着每個陌生人，像逢到了久别的情戀者那麽熱切，每一個異邦人都嗜好沉浸在這些地方，寂寞的旅舍的心亦會因此感到慰藉的。領略異國情調的味兒呵！</p>
<p>欲領略遼遠的島的那面的情調，成爲近來精神的急性食慾症，恨不得膀下即刻長了翅膀飛了過去。一日走不成我的苦惱便多一日的重量，而這重量也許會加增到壓扁了我的身了。</p>
<p>什麽時候才能使幻想結成菓子呢，這異國的憧憬！</p>

<p>— 于時夏</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>（頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚。）</p>
<p>這一句俗話怕不止流行於湖南。凡事不顧到牠的整個聯擊，只零零碎碎的對付，不從牠的根本解决，只枝枝節節的處理，眞有點象（頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚！）</p>
<p>頭痛本來是我的老毛病。記得那是十二三歲的時候，我在師範學校讀書，一個夏天患了瘧疾，一連病了兩年多。瘧疾在湖南呌做打擺子，民間相傳有擺子鬼作崇。起初我的擺子是隔天一發，後來隔兩三天一發，再後隔十來天一發，最後遇着陰天以及發風下雨的日子就發，没有一定的日期。擺子來了，總是畏寒打噤，滿身顫抖抖的，蓋上兩三條棉被還不能止冷。發冷過了，接着發熱，熱得頭昏眼花，委實難過。平時擺子不來，頭也覺得很重，又有時覺得很空虚，脚也没有力，所以很少出門。我是這樣的體弱多病，同學都以爲我是要短命的。誰知道我至今並没有死，在那些怕我短命的人裏倒有好幾個早己嗚呼哀哉了呢！</p>
<p>十多年以來，因為農村經濟的總崩潰更加深刻，我們那種小地主的家境，再也不能保持從前一樣的小康戕態了。我雖然不曾做過承襲一筆大遺産的夢，同時我也自愧没有什麽出息能够挽回在經濟破産的大勢之下的一家厄運。加以自己又討了老婆，生了兒女，負擔一天天加重，種種憂患又相逼而來。幸而身體一天天加强，不像從前那樣瘦弱，頭也不痛了。雖然在這十多年中間，也曾患過幾年胃病，去年又曾生過一次頂危險的盲腸炎症，可是病後不久，身體又漸漸復元起來。好像造物小兒有意捉弄我，呌我身體較强一點，好擔負這一付慘苦的生活重担。我怎麽能够放下這付重担呢？</p>
<p>頭是不再痛了，脚却常常大癢小痛起來，我並不曾把這種爛脚當做一種病，但以爲這是（湖南脚），湖南人不可免的。</p>

<p>（不行！不行！無論如何！第一期非抽足五十不可！五十不可！五十呀！你们上下三村一共五個，五個可還不少嗎？）</p>
<p>區長在今天還迫着要我交出人，我没法，誘約他。（等明天！等明天！）但是明天要過去的呀！他媽的！眞是倒運年口！我也再不要幹這鳥差使！······）</p>
<p>（那是不行的！鄕長總還得你幹呵。哈哈哈！）裝着假笑。得承奉處總須承奉，這是他們的做人哲學。</p>
<p>（是的。那倒推不得的。）站在一邊的冬生瘸手，也攙和着說：（除了你和大生先生以外，鄕裏還有誰當得了鄕長。大生先生又是個唸阿彌陀佛不管閒事的人，一天到晚唸幾律酒賬，香烟賬······没個兒空。）</p>
<p>（你别說費話了！）回過臉，向多生射了一眼。也嘖了一句。（你們倒底作什麽主張呢？）</p>
<p>主張？誰都没。這些個人，還得有主張嗎？</p>

<p>春秋小西天  張恨水著　　第二回　作賈入民間路回永壽别家來天上人到長安　　程志　很覺得這個人不知趣，把臉繃了起來，向陵上看去。張介夫這才把話停止，不曾向下說。這陵約莫高有五六丈，長七八丈，倒像是個小　堆。因陵的前面，是那個正殿背，並没有什麽空塲，可以回旋。陵前立了一塊高大的碑，大書周文王陵。在這陵後面，約莫四五十丈遠，另有一個陵，由一條石松路前去，在路兩旁，立了十幾幢小碑，這算是多一點的點綴品。陵墓前也是一塊大碑，上寫周武王陵。陵的四週，空塲很大，並没有什麽，只栽了些椿樹秧子。椿樹有兩種，一穏是香椿，那樹芽子可以當菜吃。一種是臭椿，樹枝最是脆弱，一摘就斷。而且那樹汁還有一股不好嗅的氣味，就是現在所種的這些了。那些椿秧子，高不到二尺，在亂草　伸出指頭粗的樹幹，四五步路才有一顆，臨風摇洩着，很是孤單。就是在程志前眼裏，也覺這裏簡陋到所以然。這還是院長來過、部長來過，重新修理過以後的事。假如不曾修理以前，就到這裏來，那麽，所看到的，恐怕就只有這兩個荒草土堆了。那常科長見他們都默然了，便笑問道；程先生，你到了這裏以後，感想怎麽樣？程志前道；到西北來遊歷的人，我想大家的感想都差不多吧？無非是覺得這裏寒苦。我倒也主張這裏的名勝，都不要太華麗了，過於華麗，就會令人聯想到，活人没有飯吃，怎麽到有錢替死了裝外表？常科長連拍了兩下掌道；好極好極！若是到西北來的人，都帶了這副眼光，我們就二十四分的歡迎了。（二三）（爸爸）（媽媽）楊　　日本文相松田，最近禁止全國小學校及幼稚院的兒童襲用（爸爸）（媽媽）這種稱呼，說是有害日本風俗。日本固有的風俗是怎樣？松田没有說。日本兒童如果襲用（爸爸）（媽媽）這種稱謂，於日本風俗究有多大害處？他亦没有說。假使（爸爸）（媽媽）被禁之後，松田打算用什麽名詞去代替？他更没有說。這雖是芝蔴般的小問題，且又似乎涵有（媽媽腔）的意味，但因爲松田是日本是文相，而我們在報紙上看到他發表的意見，又是這麽（斯文；）倒使人感有值得注意的興味。　　中國的兒童，如果他們說的是國語，大都呌父親（爸爸），母親（媽媽）。這種稱謂的歷史很悠久，且是很普遍的。但在日本，松田就說它們有害本國的風俗·其意何指，無從探測。如果因爲中國兒童在嚷着（爸爸）（媽媽），就認日本兒童受了中國的影響爲妨碍本國的風俗；設使這種猜度不錯誤，那末，松田的（大和）精神是值得拜服的！　　在中國，眼看到的，耳聽得的，西洋名詞固是（邪氣）的多！而東洋名詞可也不能說少。但中國人却用（提倡）去代替（禁止），所以中國的風俗老是這麽的壞，壞到連（爸爸）（媽媽）都給人家打人冷宫！（？）　　於此，我又得到一種感想。　　上海的（爸爸）（媽媽）丨尤其是（媽媽），對親生子女呌（弟弟）（妹妹），一洗往昔（心肝）（寳貝）之風；創自何人？究涵何義？高深莫測！這種（不倫不類）的稱呼，我想松田是很少聽到吧！如果日本的（爸爸）（媽媽）必得打入冷宫，那末上海的（弟弟）（妹妹）應當怎樣處分？這種中國人所僅有的（獨倡）精神，應否鼓勵發揚？希望我們的（文相）能發表一些高見！點滴  （誠性）　　朋友，在愛人懷裏你發見了什麽？在慈母懷裏你又發見了什麽？　　朋友，你以顯微鏡和Ｘ光綫去找出你愛人不讓你瞧穿的秘密吧！在茲母的懷抱中，你却可毫無顧忌地安睡眠！畫眉漫談  棲鳳樓主　　愛美本人之天性，而尤以婦女爲最，方今摩登女子，兢尚修飾，服裝而外，復從事於嬌靨之點染，調粉匀脂，細摩輕拂，攬鏡顧影，不厭百回，益以畫眉一道，認爲此中重要工作，蓋纖纖新月，修彎入鬢，固亦别具嫵媚，惟曩昔婦女，淡按蛾眉者多，不則，亦僅焚柳枝，取點稍事描潤而己。洎乎今時，所謂名媛嬌娃，變本加厲，生面别開，僉將天生秀眉，盡行薙去，復以舶來品之畫眉膏，重行自由塗抹，事之矛盾，無逾於此！豈欲革心先攺其面乎？偶與若輩相語，其點者猶反唇相譏，君不聞畫眉之張京兆乎？古者創之，後人因之，似不爲過，何偏責之太甚！予默然退，面稽京兆之遺韵。　　按張京兆名敞，後　人，嘗官京兆尹，故名，曾爲婦畫眉，後世艶之，傳爲韵事，惟予聞諸某父老云；（京兆畫眉，非徒爲增妍婦色，固另有一段情史在，而纒綿悱惻，别有情致，蓋相傳敞於童稚時，美丰姿，一夕，夢白髯老翁，偶叩以佳耦所在？翁指左鄰豆腐肆中草囤内之女孩，曰，此卽汝之妻也。翌日往視，孩適嬌啼骯髒，涕泗横流，敞年少氣盛，覩狀大憤！拾石遙擲孩面百遁，度其意殆欲中傷之，而得别求良匹，迺孩受擊後，僅左眉中斷，餘幸無恙，無何，孩漸長成，嗣某紳爲義女，時敞亦己出仕，頗有賢聲，爲紳所聞，偵其未娶，因以義女妻之，却扇之夕，銀燭映照紅妝，丰姿綽約，惜眉嫵中折，因詢以故？女舉當年事告之，敞感愧交並！亟揮彩毫描續，以掩殘痕）云云。　　綜上所述，則敞之爲婦畫眉，端爲掩飾殘痕，以視今之婦女，矯揉造作者，其旨相去殊遠矣。  東生御香縹緲錄  淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯　　待他們把那支馬賽里斯歌奏完之後，伊就特地敎李蓮英親自出馬，走去把那所有的樂器，一件一件的取過來，讓伊自己反覆去的騐看着。同時還讓他們並肩棲息在一支式樣很好看的樹枝上。在這樹枝的兩端，各有一個白玉琢就的小杯子裝着，杯子裏分裝着清水和食糧，以供他們吃喝。皇太后一見了這件特殊的禮物，心上似乎十二分的高興；伊還嫌看不清楚，又敎李蓮英去接了過來捧得約莫離開伊兩三尺遠近伊這才可以細細地揣詳了。其時，我們都不由暗暗在好笑，以爲這兩頭鸚鵡祇是一種很平常的鳥類，竟值得太后高抬貴眼，如此鄭重的去賞鑒它們，未免過于得視了！不料二三分鐘之後，它們立刻就顯出了它們的特長來，以致于使我們每個人都大吃一驚。原是那兩頭中的一頭，突然用極清脆的音調，高呌道；　　（老佛爺吉祥如意！）　　這一呌，眞把所有的人全顚倒了！尤其是它的咬字正確，聽去眞像小孩子的說話一般無二，更敎人萬公詫異。豈知正當衆人竊竊私議，驚訝不止的當兒，那另外一頭忽又喊道；　　（老佛爺平安！）　　我想袁世凱爲着要使這兩頭小鳥喊出這樣清晰的字句來，必然己化了不少的心血，至少限度，必然己敎慣于養鳥的人，代他化　了不少心血了　否則就是會叫，也不能樣這樣的恰好在適當的時候呌起來。（一三三）雙于之相書畫  隠　　琴隠後人湯定之君，近號雙于道人，凡識定之者，當可知其用意之所在。以别號寫照古今，不乏其例，然無此二字之饒有風趣也。道人畫以荒率取勝，尤擅巨幅，去歲爲某君作八尺屏十二條，見者無不歎服，蓋以道人由書入畫，其書則如天馬行空，不受覊勒也。憶道人遊兩粤時，喜吟咏，朋友問嘗以三絶畫書詩譽之。自光復後絶不談詩而致力於相術，頗自許，並以相書畫爲三絶次第，是殆湯君自謙，故作反語耳。小食譜本地月餅和廣東月餅  張凰　　我國人於口福一道，是最不肯輕易放過的。每逢大小時節到臨，大家小户，總都有一種或幾種習慣上認爲應時的食品必須置備，作爲虚應故事之用，其實是替大衆的口腹打算罷了。　　在中秋節，那個一年中最是光明團　的在自然界的月子，最是當行了；所以就有象形的月餅，也及時有食品都份佔着優越的地位。這種食品，在滋味上，或在製作的技巧上，是有何等特殊獨立的優點麽？這也和通常的餅，餃，包子的工料一樣，把麵做皮子，隨意裏入甜的，鹹的東西，作爲饀兒便成；饀料貴重些，那滋味也跟着可口些罷了。　　江南富庶之邦，産物精妙，名聞全國；更有素稱心工細巧的蘇州人，裂出小吃的（茶食），足爲工浙人掙不少面子。可是，在這樣大節令上，這應時的月餅，却不論商店發售的，或私家杜做的，（在事實上，人家做月餅也是很少的，）出口都未見佳妙。最可惡的，有一次，我在童年時，曾經長輩給我這麽四個裝的一盒蘇式甜月餅，木片做的盒子，外包白紙，面貼紅紙招牌，倒也整齊燕眼；這是那位長輩的度節例有的賞賚，據說還是他迎合的喜吃甜食的心理咧。我領情之下，乘着一團高興，破盒取食。那一方黏附在餅底面不可吃的紙張經過很費事地揭凈，己使我微感不快。不料那半個咬在口内的月餅，厚厚的皮子又焦又膩，其中包着的一撤惡糖，結成硬塊，有所謂（食之太甜，棄之可惜）；畢竟我忍不了這甜味，偷偷地出而哇之。從此以後，我對於中秋節吃月餅這件事，完全没有興趣了！　　廣東製法的月餅，便比較的不同多了。餅的大小不等，那皮子總很軟糯，除非經過太久的時日，又帶有一點甜意，這先佔了勝着；内藏的饀料又有很多的花色，都是經過着地的製鍊手續而後用的，可稱爲配製得宜。近年來這項廣東月餅，推行幾及全國，也很順利地侵入江浙一帶的月餅市塲，佔奪了那本地製品的大部份的位置。在這裏，足見得閒食的東西雖是小道，也不可不加以研究，求得進境；要是終於停頓在千百年前的舊法上，自有優良的産品起而代之了。像本地製法的月餅，縱使不致被擠到失傳的地步，恐怕也不免孤負令節，而見嘆於呌姊咧！　　廣東月餅和别種月餅一樣的，店家開秋（廢歷七月初一日）便行製售，各運専長，推陳出新，寵賜嘉名，且有特訂價册的，簡直是當一回事。而口有同嗜，出品較好的店家幾有日不暇給之勢；像上海三大公司，特爲暫停製作應市的西點，把全副精神放在製作廣東月餅上去。這一時期的買賣，無疑地是祇爲供給吃食的了。但不知爲什麽一過中秋這一日，全市一律停歇不售廣東月餅了？我想，那全市許多吃客，决不會一致行動的，因爲過時而不要吃廣東月餅了罷。這不知有没有什麽特别原因，待等逢到冠生園主人洗君時，倒要問問他咧。　　來函　九月一日婦女特刋（明費宫人故居的訪問），牌樓係華世奎所書，並非嚴修。地址係在鼓樓東而非鼓樓北。沙金君在黄昏時匆匆一過，難免有以上錯誤，特請更正，俾昭翔實。又談巷現名費家胡同，費氏後裔尚有住居左近者，但均多零落矣。天津無聲上言。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言中國的危險  克諍　　九一八的晚上，找着同住的戴老板的大兒子，聽說是在小學裏讀書的，年齡十四歲，本人因爲要測騐小學生對於國恥的觀念，就同他談談，於是發生了以下的談話。　　你們今天有没有静默五分鐘紀念國恥？　　我們没有，静默幹什麽！　　静默是紀念國恥，紀念國恥就是要振起愛國心，難道你們不知道愛國嗎？愛什麽國，難道小學生好打車洋人嗎？　　亡國奴是要受人幸割的，我國還没有亡，葉木花己被日本小學生殺死，連交涉結果都没有，難道你也願被日本人殺死和殺死你的同胞不覺得氣嗎？那我不去日本好了，殺死葉木花，有什麽氣！管他幹嗎！　　朝鮮的亡國，人民是多麽痛苦，難道你們先生没有告訴你們這些故事嗎？你們預備將來怎樣做一個國民？要不要替同胞報仇？丨丨記者是帶着失望的聲調。　　死人也勿關，我們就是只曉得讀書。　　讀書是要曉得一切，難道你讀書一生一世嗎？那末，書中對於愛國的意思如何呢？　　國要我們受嗎？等我們愛國，國早亡了，我願意做凉血動物。戴小開裝着上海的流氓腔的口吻說。　　你們是將來中國的主人翁，你們不愛她誰愛？中國是到處都鬧着災，同胞們流離得多麽苦？（指着弄堂口逃荒的婦人）你不想救救她們嗎？　　她們是自己不好，你知道是誰的不好！　　天災來，是不能料的，同時也要有人才來設法救治，我們相人現在没有人才，你不想將來做一個救災的大人物嗎？　　我們的什麽災，我們在上海。　　江浙的人，是得天獨厚，并且在上海是完全靠外國人的福，這是我們的恥辱呀！我們要自己來創造安樂的地方，這才對啦！　　那末，你爲什麽不去希車洋人，不去救災！我們學堂中，全是英文，中文是不在乎的。丨丨表示洋人是容易接近的態度。　　讀外國文字，是要吸收外國文化，不是做洋奴用的，你可明白？　　哈哈哈，哦哦哦，戴小開似嘲笑般的跑了出去。　　這一席話，眞使得我（悵惘萬分）（啼笑皆非）；對於未來新中國的熱望，似乎在腦壳中完全消逝。危險的中國，不禁千萬的感想擁住了喉嚨！　　分析上面的談話，雖然不是全般，但至少可以看出國内有若干小學生的頭腦，是；（一）對國家無熱烈觀念；（二）對政府無人仰心；（三）對紀念認爲無意義；（四）思想頽唐；（五）缺乏人類同情；（六）無廉恥心；（七）充滿奴性，（八）祇知讀書發財。（而都市兒童爲尤甚）以未來之主人翁，有着這八點足以滅種的腦筋，就是日人不來滅我，己足自亡有餘，是誠我國之極大隠憂，思之不寒而慄！（却酬）寂寞的雨夜  雅非　　（雨夜！多寂寞的雨夜呵！）吾實在感到苦悶了，一顆赤熱的心，也幾乎從嘴裏跳了出來；然而，終於迸出了一聲深長的歎息！　　秋風己吹去了炎夏的暑氣，細雨却帶來了秋夜的凉爽。風吹着憔悴的楓葉，發出那沙沙的碎聲，雨點子打上落葉的梧桐，滴出了清脆的音調；這感人的　凉景象呵！勾起了吾無限的悉懷！　　窗外的雨是儘在淅淅瀝瀝的下着，那滴滴嗒嗒的聲音，敲破了整個深夜的沉寂，這秋夜的蟲聲，己不聽見了悲鳴。但那清脆的雨聲，在這静静的深夜裏，却根外　得清晰；一　一嗒都刺進了吾的卫　，一點一滴都打在吾的民頭，冷雨滲透了吾熱的血液，为風吹淡了吾心的紅色！　　一疊一疊的思潮，都向吾心頭湧來，一幕一幕的回憶，又在吾腦膜上映出；吾不能睡了，實在不能睡了。走下床來，點上煤油燈；那燈光可也作怪，一閃一閃地，似乎也在嘲笑吾做人没有勇氣，吾看了很氣，恨不得將它摔了才鬆快。　　吾鋪了一張素紙在檯上，把筆醮飽了；想了想，寫什麽呢？寫信吧！給誰？朋友！吾没有朋友；綸愛人！更不必說；給家，吾可没有家！祇有隨着流浪到那裏，那裏就算了吾的家。父母！可惜父親早死了；母親是現在不知她在什麽地方？寫小說，不懂！寫（秋風秋雨悉殺人！）等　　詩詞；那尤其　不上了。所以；隔　好久好久，檯上依然　着一張素紙；手裏却仍舊擎着一支筆，</p>
<p>Page 19</p>
<p>對着窗外黑暗陰森的空氣發楞，雨絲從窗隙裏鑽進來，飄到身上，吾猛可的打了一個寒噤。看看白紙，自己倒覺得失笑，深更半夜還不睡覺，儘坐着怔怔的空想些什麽？　　素紙上突然現出了幾個圈圈，不知是什麽時候畫上的，吾也記不清楚了。但是在這圈圈裏面可望見宇宙，及宇宙間一切的事物，並且也看得見世界上各式各樣的人和各式各樣的事；那裏面，有吾所欲說的話，也有所想着的事，清清晰晰，一一都在圈子裏幻出了。吾問宇宙，宇宙倒底有多末大？是圓的還是方的？吾問世界，世界究竟面積有多少方里？是平坦的，抑是崎嶇的？吾要想的事，千頭萬緖怎樣想起才對？吾要說的話，萬語千言何從說起呢？太多了，委實太多了！吾就不想也不說吧！閉上眼睛，定一定神，睡終是睡不着了。隨手抽起一本書，看，（呐喊），嘘！翻開來第一篇便是（狂人日記），要不得，那魯迅老頭兒専會騙人，吾不看它；把書本掩起來，但戀戀不忍撇下，終於再把它打開來，這回翻着的却是（阿Ｑ正傳），吾想，假使吾是阿Ｑ的話，這是多末有趣啊！　　夜凉闖進了心幕，黑暗籠罩着週遭，雨，敲在玻璃窗上，奏出那鏗鏘的音韻，外面的風，似乎更大了些，牆下的靑蛙，也彷彿懂得這裏有一個失意的人兒在感到寂寞，所以也不是覺的呌出了牠同情的呼號！　　夜是更深了，凉意也跟着漸漸地逼緊了，攏來；吾在房裏無聊地踱了一回，也有些感到忍耐不住了，便把一個沉重的　壳猛然地向床上擲去，丢在床上，静静地躺着，躺着；可是兩眼老是合不攏來。吾倒底在煩惱些什麽？痛苦些什麽？却連吾自己也回答不出其所以然，然而煩惱總覺得煩惱，痛苦總覺得痛苦。　　這裏留給吾的印像太壞，明天準回上海去，回上海去，吾决不再留戀在這裏了。　　胡思亂想了半天，睡魔依舊站得遠遠的，不肯近身；玻璃窗上望上去，己經爬上了一絲微微的曙光。　　（兩夜，這多寂寞的雨夜呵！你終于走了嗎？）吾又似驚似喜的嘆息着。悲哀的一羣  阿彦閑話  辰谷川如是閑著若木選譯　　相對之貞操，爲人類繁殖的信約；絶對的貞操，乃人類減絶的信約。　　死是事實，然不能有經騐。　　生命是刹那間的事實。死是永刦的事實。　　死者應瞑目，老者應忘記。　　有不甘受恥辱的餓死，没有名譽的餓館。　　没有嗅覺者以屍爲快樂之聲。　　古之君子惡盜泉之名不飲；令之君子攺盜泉之名而飲之。　　古之靑年將野心作妾；今之靑年以煩悶作妻。　　壯者應想息樣來苦悶自己，老者應思怎樣來娱樂自己。　　不會煩悶的靑年，是因爲人生初期的經騐不足。不安心的老翁，是因爲人生終期之經騐未完。　　將應記憶之事忘記，是大大的不便。將應該忘記的事，偏記憶着，是大大的不幸。　　生而孤獨者不幸，死而孤獨者更加不幸。　　光榮使女子死。屈辱使男子生。　　愛而一者是幸福，愛而死者出是幸福。　　情死是結婚之一形式。　　純潔的結婚是少年人的空想；純潔的情死，是戲家的空想。　　潰敗軍，僅剩所持的大砲，忘國，只存所執的正義。　　猪之悲劇，卽屠者之喜劇。　　外交家與幽靈同樣用微笑威嚇敵人。　　强者的道德是權利；弱者的道德是義務。　　聖人之死乃自己的復活。豪傑之死，乃他人的復活。　　古是神造人。現在是人造神。　　有可生的理由的人鮮，有該死的理由的人多。　　男子結婚後始知女子之贒，女子結婚後乃知男子之愚。　　臭氣是動物認識同類之標誌，過於没有臭氣的人類，便不會受任何人的同類視，於是乎成爲孤獨。　　己所不欲而施於人者，基督敎國的道德；己所欲勿施於人者，儒敎國的道德。</p>

<p>沈默  超人　　秋陽淡淡地斜射在馬斯南路上，熙攘的人羣中走着一個修長的靑年，拖了遲鈍的脚步，頭俯得低低的，在東邊人行道上朝南踱去。修長的影子慢慢地移近法公園的入口處，跟着便是一陣糢糊的閃動，守門巡捕抬起他代替轉動樣的唯一職司的手。　　園中葱蘢的樹木，平坦的草地，襯出一片自然景象，至少能使人暫時忘記都市的塵囂；他把肺葉深深地呼吸了一下，胸部跟着朝着挺起，頭也平抬了起來。他的全身沐在陽光裏，一頭蓬亂的頭髮壓着瘦削的雙頰，寬大的前額很早熟的刻上縐紋，憂鬱的臉膛一點血色也没有，他整個面貌很有表情，但却帶着呆重的樣子。　　他找了一處静些的地方坐下，眼瞪着淡藍的天空，飛鳥一般的白雲高高蕩着，風滑過樹梢，響起陣陣寒瑟的抖動：在這秋的景色裏，他想能來這裏把緊縛的心鬆一下。他倒在椅上，完全走進了回憶的夢境，他虚弱的腦中，幻影般一幕幕想起幾年來的一切。幾年來流浪中，悠長的鐵路　成了走廓，大小旅舍象是日常的歸宿，許多城市，碼頭，山野，都印上了足跡，足跡所到都嘗遍了人世間一般的苦辛，他浮萍似的飄了幾年，祇剩下一顆忠寳的心無倦地伴着。　　過去的幾年中雖然受盡了挫折，從没有灰心一次，他不是志餒的人，他那顆忠實的心無倦地鼓着熱情。但是，因着圓滑人情的賜予，和自身心理的演進，他終究發現了人生的予盾。　　從此，懷疑深埋進他的靈魂，他感到前途的黑暗，他看到現實的虚僞，對於以前認爲很有意義的幾年生活，開始懷疑起來。同時因爲生活的鞭笞，祇能天天在這都市中敷延着，他没有勇氣去自殺，抑鬱，失望，憤怒，襲擊着他那顆忠實的心。　　他漸漸地弄成變態的心理，他和旁人講話時從不敢暢快的多談，講一句話，總得思前顧後，祇怕衝撞了人，偶然從他昏沈的頭腦發現别人的話含有譏駡的成份，丨丨其實也許是没有的丨丨，他就要咎責自己，溜到没人的地方搥自己的胸部，搥自己那顆不爭氣的腦袋。　　有時候他也能很清醒地把自己安慰起來，他一次次自己發誓不再憂慮，不再悲傷，他告訴自己說人類原没有公平和情感，人世間滿佈着卑鄙和殘酷，處事都是自私的，批評也都存了偏見。他知道無論親戚朋友都是烏鴉到處黑，人祇能墮波逐流，學着多數人們的樣子，敷衍自己的一生就得了。　　但是，這些清醒對於他完全没有帮助，在生存的追求中，永遠陷於這般心理。他自己祇能做到一件事，就是節制往日的情感，把日常笑嘻嘻拉開着的嘴緊緊關攏，來一個沈默！　　今天他想躱在自然懷抱中，向那清清的流水，或是秋季的花木，講出一些煩悶。只是事實糟得很，這人工的自然景象雖然能清醒一下耳目，空氣裏同樣也充滿了宴會室中虚僞的成份。　　時候己經坐得很久了，坐椅給榜晚的陰影蔽遮，滿園己呈着遲暮的樣子，一陣狂風掠起枯葉，送着凉氣把他駕醒，站起來摸着單薄的衣衫。夜遊  何適　　每當晚飯後回到家裏的時候，孤獨的冷感襲擊着我有時好像置身於冰窟裏頭，而寂寞就如賣淫婦亿地走近我的身邊來誘惑我。　　丨丨寂寞喲，我並不愛你。我焦心急爆地駡她。　　於是乎她變成披頭散髮的惡鬼，而使我害怕起來了。　　爲了不愛她，爲了害怕她，我離開家裏夜游去了。　　在夜遊的開始，我並没有目的，馬路上儘多給我低頭徘徊的地方；也曾混在羅宋女人的水氣息裏，跟着她們的笑聲走遍了霞飛路那一段最富於異國情調的秋夜了街；也曾獨身地躑躅着走下西伯利亞似的徐家匯路，聽那秋聲在樹梢頭哮吼着哀鳴着。　　終於走一走，走回頭來而被爵士音樂的旋律誘惑進了跳舞塲。　　在那肉香烟氣的氛圍裏，我將自己安放在一個僻静暗黑的角落裏，吃我的濃咖啡，吸我的辣烟草，願意將自己的心靈沉醉在爵士音樂的旋律裏。　　據說跳舞是（上火山），我現在將自己安放在火山之麓，想到了這，爵士音樂的旋律聽不見，祇是在觀察着（上火山）的人們。觀察每一個人的形狀姿態與表情，於我也是每每引起興趣來的，就這樣，坐在火山之麓常常一坐可以坐到幾個鐘頭。　　穿着一九三四年式的聳肩西裝，配着一條白綾子繡五彩花龍的領帶，油滑的頭髮，光漆的皮鞋，那是每一個公子哥兒的普通衣裝與普通打扮，這是在馬路上就可以常常看到的，不去注意他；一個老頭兒却給我映上眼簾印入腦裏了。　　他的身材是那麽的倭而胖，短短的腿兒支持着圓圓的腰，凸出的肚，廣闊的肩，支持着一大段樹根似地在擺着跳着；而兩隻肥大的而亦是短短的手兒，右隻摟着舞娘的腰間，左手捻住舞娘的玉掌，在搖着牽着；一個秃着頂油着臉的頭顱，兩隻眼睛小得和猪玀的一樣，（還在瞇瞇地表演着沉醉的微笑呢）！一個大嘴巴咬緊着牙齒，連嘴唇上的兩撇鬍了都在動着；而那兩片鼻翼一上一下地在喘氣。他不是在跳舞，而是在抱石頭過河，汗水在頭上流，在背上泛濫，難怪他跳了一支曲子就用手巾揩汗呢。　　没有一個老太婆也給我鑑賞到了。說她是老太婆，其實未免（缺德）。在她自己看來，還以爲是正表現着後期靑春美的（半老徐娘）呢。她的身材雖然和普通的中國婦人一樣高大，可是在我看來，她未免是吃了脂肪質的養料太多了，怎麽要長得那麽胖，難道要和外國老太婆比賽體重的嗎？她的大身體，特别用臀部與肚子表示出來，這還不足爲奇；她的肥大的頸兒，縮得那麽的短，將一個大頭顱就好像夾在肥而高聳的肩頭之下一樣，那才令人不禁要發笑了。這樣的身材，己經够了，她還長着一個胖大的面孔，而那胖大的面孔上面，是兩隻小眼睛，一個大鼻子，還有一個大嘴巴，丨而且腦後還留着一個Ｓ字髻子啦。她穿着一身鑿花白華而紗旗袍，衣領邊結上一個茉莉花球，看去怪時髦的，可惜小大脚走起路來是八字形，而令人更加要笑了。她的舞興特别濃，少年請她跳，她跳，老年請她跳她也跳，到了没人請她跳的時候，她下池子跳起舞娘來。　　這是前幾夜的事，可是那老頭兒與那老在婆給我的興趣，使我到了現在一想起，還有時自己要默然地笑起來。小說叔叔的辮子（十）（一）  凌鶴　　（那末難道說皇帝一點辦法也没有嗎？）　　（有什麽辦法呢？現在所能做到的，只是看見人心趨向共和，便想立憲的辦法，希望能够籠絡人心，可是這很顯明，不過是官樣文章而己，可况朝内又没有誠心。前幾天報上登過一個聖旨，文章倒做得挺漂亮的。那個原文是這樣的：　　九月初二日内閣奉上諭朕演紹丕基，於今三載。勵求治理，夙夜競競。茲屆資政院第二次開院之期，爾議員等其敎聽朕命；方今世界文明憲政尤爲當務之急，自上年十月體仰先朝與民更新之意，俯順内外臣工之請，特降諭旨縮攺宣統五年開設議院並修攺籌備清單，期限則年近一年，籌劃乃日繁一日。該院負國民之重望，持恊議之權輿。前者己略具規模，今茲更當有進步。所有原議事項，急應聚衆思以廣益，求一是以廣充，以期漸有端倪，月臻完備。除上年該未院經議竣各案應接議外，朕特命國務大臣，將各項案件，陸續籌擬照章交議。爾議員等洞觀國勢，熟審輿情，其各體念時艱，發攄忠愛；總使法立而民不擾，論定而事可行，用以鞏固邦基，弼成郅法，朕有厚望焉！將此持諭知之。欽此！　監國攝政王欽章奕歐那桐徐世昌署名。　　你看罷，這還不是官樣文章嗎？說到另一方在，從茲懿握權以來，朝廷對於袁世凱的寵用，那眞是千古未有的。可是，袁世凱那個傢伙眞狠心；現在革命黨打得那樣利害他却按兵不動，他要蔭昌的兵都歸他領帶。少不了聖上只得依他，下一道上諭是：（陸軍大臣蔭昌，部務繁雜，勢難在外久留，着急將第一軍交馮國璋領率。）那麽馮國璋是袁世凱的心腹，今後大軍在握，誰曉得會不會造反呢？還有一點，那就是朝廷没有軍費，所以滿洲籍大官，都立賬大借外僨，寗可將一二省的土地抵押給外國，不肯讓革命革佔天下。不過，聖上看見大勢己去，己預備遷都西安了？······）</p>

<p>Well Wall Collapses and Injures Ten People</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 1:40 AM on the 19th, a sudden gas explosion occurred in the Maja Gou coal mine in Tangshan, setting off a fire at the eighth stone gate of the three-way passage and the nine-trough coal channel. At that time, thick smoke filled the air and it was impossible to see. The well wall collapsed due to the vibrations. Of the workers working inside, more than ten escaped, but eight were crushed under the coal, suffering serious injuries. The lower bodies of two were crushed and they are now disabled. After engineers led workers to rescue, the injured were rescued and sent to the hospital. (20th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Huang Fu Visited He Yingqin for a Long Talk and Received Yu Xuezhong and Others</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Paraded and Demonstrated in Qian'an</p>
<p>Ruffians Formed Gangs to Disturb Fushan Temple</p>
<p>(Peiping) Huang Fu went to Jurentang at 9:00 AM this morning to visit He Yingqin and had a long talk lasting three hours, finally leaving the Political Reorganization Council at 12:00 PM. It is said that Huang was discussing the progress of council affairs and inquiring about the situation in various provinces of North China. He has decided to convene the fourth plenary session of the Political Reorganization Council within the next week. He has ordered the First Section to prepare everything and will telegraph Han Fuju, Xu Yongchang, Fu Zuoyi, Song Zheyuan, and Yu Xuezhong to come to Peiping to attend after the date is determined. Song is currently in Tianjin and will come to Peiping to report on the recent situation in Chahar Province to Huang. He will return to Zhangjiakou after attending the Political Reorganization Council plenary session. Clues have been found regarding the whereabouts of the murderer Wu Runbi in the Yutian incident, and he is being tracked down. Yin Rugeng returned to Peiping from Tianjin last night and visited Huang this afternoon to report on the current situation in the Ji-Mi bandit area and the truth about the recent incident in Yutian in which Japanese merchant Miyakoshi was mistakenly shot and killed. Tao Shangming is scheduled to come to Peiping from Tangshan tonight to visit Huang. Cheng Xixian, the representative of Han Fuju, arrived in Peiping this morning. Han is scheduled to come to Peiping to visit Huang and report and discuss matters with him since Huang has returned to Peiping. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Yu Xuezhong arrived in Peiping from Tianjin this afternoon and separately visited Huang Fu and He Yingqin to report on the handling of the Qian'an and Yutian incidents. He will return to Tianjin in a few days and come to Peiping again to attend the Political Reorganization Council plenary session when it is scheduled. Yu said that the Japanese side had contacted him regarding the Qian'an incident. After investigating and confirming the facts, compensation can be given to the deceased. The Yutian incident is similar to the Ying missionary case. Once the murderer is apprehended, he will be severely punished. The resolution of these two cases should not be a problem. The puppet Manchukuo soldiers captured in Zunhua have been interrogated in the province and are ready to be sentenced. Although Liu Guitang and his like are still active, the bandits recruited by them are not as many as rumored. Strict precautions have been taken and there is no cause for concern. The Yellow River breach in Changyuan and other places is unlikely to pose a danger again. Relief efforts are being handled by both the central government and Hebei Province, each providing 100,000 yuan. Although there are rumors in North China, they are not credible. He came here to report everything to Huang and will not stay long, returning to Tianjin immediately. He does not know when the Political Reorganization Council will hold a plenary session. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Yin Rugeng said that after the Yutian County government arrested Gao's younger brother Wenru, the wife of the fugitive murderer Wu Runbi, as a result of the investigation, clues were found regarding the whereabouts of Wu Runbi and the accomplice Wang Qinghong, and they are now being tightly pursued. According to the investigation, Wu Runbi's father was a bandit leader in the Yutian area and was captured and executed by the county government. The six Japanese ruffians discovered in Shixia went to Miyun after leaving Shixia and even borrowed 160 yuan from the county government. After I telegraphed to Captain Nagami of the Japanese army in Gubeikou, he dispatched several military police to arrest and monitor them and escorted them to his unit for handling. Yin Tixin will come to Peiping in a day or two. Tao Shangming and Chai Shan will arrive in Peiping from Tianjin tonight. Tao is scheduled to visit Huang tomorrow morning. Huang flew to Peiping by Ford plane yesterday. The plane flew back to Beijing this afternoon. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Regarding the Qian'an Fushan Temple incident, the Japanese representative Consul General Tanaka directly approached the Hebei Provincial Government for negotiations. After Tao Shangming's back-and-forth consultations, although the findings of the investigations by both sides were not entirely consistent, the provincial government, in order to quickly resolve the dispute, replied to the Japanese consulate on the morning of the 15th with a reasonable solution, which can be properly and completely negotiated. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Chai Shan returned to Peiping by car this morning. Regarding the Yutian incident, Japan stated that this case will not be negotiated by the Tianjin Japanese Consulate or the North China Garrison Army. China can directly contact the Kwantung Army for further negotiations on this case. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong went to Peiping at 9:00 AM this morning to visit Huang Fu and report on various political and diplomatic affairs in North China since May. Yin Rugeng, also busy returning to Peiping to report to Huang, returned to Peiping in the same car. Tao Shangming visited Tianjin Japanese Acting Consul General Tanaka Shotaro this morning to negotiate the Qian'an incident. The Japanese consulate requested that the Chinese government still be responsible for searching for the body of the deceased. Tao agreed to visit Huang Fu and Yu Xuezhong in Peiping for instructions. According to Tao Shangming, the remaining conditions have not been fully agreed upon and can be resolved after two or three more meetings. Tao went to Peiping this afternoon at 4:00 PM to visit Huang Fu and request instructions. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A squad of Japanese troops from Luan County, fully armed, led by the squad leader, demonstrated at Fushan Temple in Qian'an on the 18th and paraded in Qian'an County City before leaving in the early morning of the 19th. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) In recent days, a dozen or so Japanese and Korean ruffians formed a gang, pretending to search for the bodies of murdered Koreans and causing disturbances in Fushan Temple Village, causing the villagers to flee elsewhere. Only a dozen elderly and weak people remained in the village, a very desolate situation. (20th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Zhao Dazhong secretly came to the Japanese Concession in Tianjin with a Japanese ruffian named Ninomiya and is hiding there. In order to avoid attention from the outside world, Zhao is secretly in Tianjin, plotting everything with Liu Guitang and Shi Yousan. He has dispatched a traitor named Li Zhi to operate in Tangshan, secretly inciting Tangshan miners. Li lives in a drug-selling foreign firm established by Ninomiya's friend Fukuyuan. On the surface, he serves as an employee of the firm, secretly communicating with Zhao. Zhao Lei, the commander of the Second Security Regiment stationed in Tangshan, is very helpful to the Public Security Bureau in investigating and arresting Zhao Dazhong's associates, so Zhao cannot gain a foothold in Tangshan.

<p>(Tianjin) Yan Huiqing told a Central News Agency reporter on the 20th that Soviet Russia's admission to the League of Nations, now that it has been passed, is a major change after the Soviet revolution. Regarding the situation in the Far East, from now on, it will be able to give a considerable blow to aggressors legally, morally, and politically. The League of Nations' acceptance of Soviet Russia into the League of Nations and granting it a seat as a permanent member of the council naturally increases its international status. If not for the progress of Soviet Russia's construction, the reform of its domestic politics, and its diplomatic efforts, it would never have achieved today's results and be valued by countries around the world. Our country's re-election as a non-permanent member was unsuccessful, and the disappointment it has given us is truly regrettable. Two months ago, I heard that the result was still satisfactory, but now this twist has occurred. Perhaps there are other inside stories, which is also unknown. However, we should also take this stimulus to reflect deeply. This morning, I telegraphed to Litvinov to express my congratulations on Soviet Russia's admission to the League of Nations and its acquisition of a permanent seat. As for the exact date of my return to office, it must be determined one month later. Because my heart disease, since returning to the country in April, has been diagnosed and treated by doctors, and X-rays have been used to examine the inside of the heart. It will take six months to verify whether it is completely cured. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Activities Began Three Months Ago</p>
<p>Contacted Thirty-Seven Countries One After Another and Everything Was Ready</p>
<p>Major Powers Insisted on Rotation, and the Situation Changed Greatly</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated on the 20th regarding China's recent election campaign in the League of Nations: China's competition in the League of Nations to renew its term as a non-permanent member of the administrative council began as early as three months ago. The steps were to telegraph our ambassadors stationed abroad to first contact the smaller countries, and after there were considerable leads, to consult with the major powers and then submit it to the meeting. The telegrams for these exchanges and consultations could fill a ruler. At that time, in order to avoid the attention of the competing countries, everything was strictly kept secret, so few people outside knew about it. When the campaign began, it was carefully studied with important ambassadors stationed in Europe, who believed that there was still little certainty. Because China was initially elected because China mainly led, and that one country in a continent must be elected in rotation to demonstrate fairness. It was difficult to start over at this time. However, although the government knew that this was the case, it decided not to consider success or failure for the sake of its international position and proceeded according to the original plan. It contacted and finalized agreements with 37 countries, including Ireland. We believed that we had enough votes for re-election and submitted the application to the general assembly. However, because major powers insisted on the principle of rotation, and Persia suddenly abandoned its candidacy midway, the situation changed greatly. It was also heard that other countries were contacting each other, all using commercial interests as exchange conditions, while our country relied entirely on friendly relations. This is another reason for our country's failure. The assistance of various small countries to our country this time is truly something that our people should be grateful for.

<p>Huai River Diversion Association Draws Up an Outline</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Huai River diversion to the sea project will begin in mid-October. The Jiangsu Provincial Government will borrow funds to handle the lower reaches of the Huai River diversion to the sea work. The Huai River Diversion Association believes that since the lower reaches are being undertaken by Jiangsu Province, the work in the upper reaches should also be carried out at the same time. A letter has been sent to the Anhui Provincial Government, following the precedent of Jiangsu Province, to quickly raise funds to cooperate with the Huai River Diversion Association's plan. The method will be to first draw up an outline of the earthwork projects such as dike construction and river dredging that can be implemented manually, complete the measurements, and then submit the plans to the provincial government for implementation. A loan of 5 million yuan has been borrowed from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board for the Three Rivers movable dam as construction costs, guaranteed by the Ministry of Finance with the customs treasury, with future Canal shipping tax revenue as the principal and interest repayment fund. Both parties have largely agreed, and the Boxer Indemnity Board is expected to convene a board meeting next month to approve it. The Huai River Diversion Association will proceed with construction once the loan is resolved and is expected to be completed within two years. (20th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e33">Using Foreign Capital to Develop Sichuan's Resources <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>The talk of using foreign capital to develop Sichuan's mining industry has been the subject of much public discussion for some time. Recently, according to reports on the remarks made by Yang Can-san, the general manager of the Juxingcheng Bank, the talk of borrowing money from the British is not entirely unfounded. However, Mr. Yang stated that the current negotiations with the British differ in nature from previous instances of using foreign capital. First, it is purely a private negotiation, with no political implications. Second, a financial company will be established first, without directly investing in industry, to avoid the disadvantages of foreign interference. Third, there is no collateral, and borrowing and repayment of funds are free. Fourth, there is no exclusivity allowed. Based on the above news, we still have some doubts.</p>
<p>The British are known worldwide for their expertise in managing industry. Their planning of the economic organization of colonies is particularly masterful. Did they not start their management of India through the private enterprise of the East India Company? After India fell into the economic control of British merchants, the British then appointed a governor-general to rule the politics of the entire country. Similarly, before the World War in 1914, the British planned to use South Africa as a starting point to build the so-called 3C railway line to realize their ambitions. The trunk line started from the Cape of Good Hope, passed through Cairo, and reached Calcutta in India. Its extension line then crossed Tibet, followed the Yangtze River eastward, and reached Shanghai. The connecting line between the Cape of Good Hope, Cairo, and Calcutta was not economically valuable, so it became silent after the war. However, the operation in India was very active. Their relentless pressure on Tibet has not loosened at all. The local military personnel in Sichuan have been fighting among themselves for many years. Their eyes are set on their own power and position. Their understanding of international relations is not sufficient to be a match for the deep-thinking British. As for the private economic relations between the two countries, in a semi-colonial China, there is no equality to speak of. The legal norms and contractual constraints that are generally valued can only be used in international relations when the national strengths of both parties are balanced. Otherwise, they are equivalent to empty words. The serious lessons of the past in the Northeast can serve as a warning to us. This is the first reason why we still have doubts after Mr. Yang's explanation.</p>
<p>As for the organization of the financial company, it is purely in the supervisory position of lending money, and does not directly participate in the industrial organization as a shareholder of any industrial group. It can entrust the company to raise funds, and in the future, it will only audit the use of funds, etc. It seems reasonable, but in fact, the organization of modern financial capital mostly belongs to the nature of stock management, and it is not necessary for financiers to directly manage industry. Industrialists in various countries all bow their heads and submit to the instructions of a few financial capitalists, lamenting their helplessness. This is the case even in advanced countries. Given that China's industry is young and lacks the organizational training of industrial capital, if it does not engage in group competition and only uses sporadic private relationships, can it avoid the pain usually experienced by those who are passive? This is the second reason why we have doubts.</p>
<p>Mr. Yang's explanation for not allowing the existence of a monopoly is that although the raising of funds is entrusted to the British, the nationality of the subscribers is not restricted. Anyone can invest. However, the financial company is mainly British, and the location for raising funds will naturally be London first. If it is not enough, it will be supplemented by other British cities and autonomous colonies. In these areas, the British are in an absolute dominant position. Even if people from other countries join, they can only follow their leadership. This is inevitable. Moreover, it is an undeniable fact today that the superior position of financial capital leads to economic monopolies. Then, the statement that monopolies are not allowed has little room for existence. This is the third reason why we have doubts.</p>
<p>Our country is in a time of internal and external difficulties. Using foreign capital to develop the country's resources is indeed the best plan. However, when it comes to using foreign capital, at least the urgency of the projects and the relationship between ourselves and others should be distinguished. The gains and losses in between must be weighed by the welfare of the country and the nation, and the concept of private gain must be absolutely eliminated before there can be any benefit to speak of. Sichuan is relatively rich in natural resources, but its industry is still underdeveloped. It has the potential to make a huge contribution to the country in the future. It should have a whole concrete plan, and be handled publicly under the guidance and supervision of the central government, so that the effect of (mutual benefit) can be achieved. In the aspect of investors, it can be a private investment, but on our side, we focus on public welfare, and it is also enough to meet the main point of the state-owned large industries in the Three Principles of the People. Otherwise, the disadvantages will come before the benefits.</p>
<h3 id="e34">US Senate Arms Investigation: Minister Shi Lodges Strong Protest, Saying Cotton-Wheat Loan for Arms Purchase is Absurd <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, Chinese Minister to the United States Shi Zhaoji lodged a strong protest with the State Department, denying the claim in the Senate Investigating Committee that China used part of the cotton-wheat loan to purchase arms. Minister Shi, acting on instructions from the Nanjing government, stated in the protest that this statement was purely unfounded, and the government was very indignant about it. Minister Shi requested Secretary of State Hull to order the Chairman of the Investigating Committee, Mr. Nye, to provide evidence to prove the allegations made by the committee. Reliable Chinese in Washington all believe that China did not misappropriate 10 million yuan of the cotton-wheat loan to purchase arms. Moreover, Mr. Lovett, the general manager of the U.S. Aircraft Foreign Trade Company, testified that he did not believe that China had used the loan for other purposes. A telegram from the Associated Press in Nanjing stated that the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs requested the publication of the names of Chinese officials who received commissions for arms purchases, which has attracted much attention here. The various scandals revealed by the Investigating Committee in the past half month have become a matter of national attention, and have also aroused repercussions from foreign governments. It has now turned to investigating the manipulation of Congress by American arms dealers. The committee presented evidence today that the Pittsburgh Chemical Factory had actively tried to influence the previous Congress to pass laws managing the manufacture of tear gas. (19th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Senate Arms Investigating Committee issued a document today stating that the committee is investigating the private arms business, not the morality of any country, because many countries have protested against the testimonies it has published. Today, the president of the Central Chemical Testing Agency testified that he had paid a commission to a certain officer of the U.S. Navy, because the officer guaranteed the establishment of a transaction in Colombia. (19th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Senate Arms Investigating Committee today investigated the methods of bribery used by the Federal Chemical Experiment Company to promote bombs, grenades, and rifles in Argentina and Brazil. According to representatives of the company, the representatives of European arms companies used bribery, so they had to imitate them. The Federal Chemical Experiment Company wanted to reduce the amount of commission for its representative stationed in the capital of Argentina, but the representative protested in a letter, saying (For the sake of the company's business, we have to contact corrupt people. How can the methods we have agreed upon with these people be known to the American side?) etc. Mr. Tesandayana, the representative of the Federal Chemical Experiment Company stationed in Venezuela, claimed that in 1932, he officially paid half of the commissions he received to the Venezuelan government, and most of the remainder was also paid to other people unofficially, so he complained a lot. The Senate Investigating Committee now plans to investigate the foreign representatives of arms companies under the (Logan Act). Jonas, the representative of the Federal Chemical Experiment Company stationed in South America, requested the Investigating Committee not to publish certain documents, saying that if the deeds of arms merchants were revealed, it would affect the other businesses of the United States in South America and lead to bankruptcy. However, the committee believes that (arms merchants are greedy for profit and disregard humanity), so it is determined to thoroughly investigate, regardless of whether arms merchants are in difficulty. Senator Bonar of the Democratic Party issued a declaration in the name of the Investigating Committee, saying that (the committee is striving to investigate the truth, not for pleasure. We hope that the American citizens in South America will understand this. We are seriously striving to discover the truth because we see that the methods used by arms manufacturers and dealers are very likely to become a threat to peace everywhere in the world.

<p>Between Alaska and Hawaii</p>
<p>Arranging a Triangular Formation</p>
<p>Practicing Offensive and Defensive Tactics Next Summer</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of the Navy Swanson formally announced today that the U.S. fleet will conduct exercises in the North Pacific next year. This exercise is held annually. According to the Secretary of the Navy, the area occupied next year will be a triangular formation, with the corners roughly being Alaska, the Pritz Islands, and the Hawaiian Islands. Secretary Shi also said that Alaska will be the main location for the exercises. The (defending) fleet will engage the (attacking) fleet in the triangular formation. Some experts believe that this exercise simulates an enemy fleet having occupied Honolulu. Secretary Shi further stated that the reason for choosing the northern Pacific for this exercise is in accordance with the consistent policy of the United States to hold exercises in the vicinity of U.S. territorial waters. Therefore, previous summer exercises were held in the south, but some have also been held near the Hawaiian Islands. The transfer to Alaska this time is based on the policy of the Navy Department to familiarize the fleet with the coastal conditions in various places. However, although the Navy Department has repeatedly stated that the actions of the fleet are (routine matters), observers believe that this action has significant meaning given the tense situation in the Far East and Japan's request to abolish the naval ratio system. Recently, the government has paid great attention to the establishment of a naval base in Dutch Harbor, a small port in Alaska outside the Aleutian Islands. The Army and Navy have twice flown to the area in the name of friendly competition, and a submarine squadron has also gone there at the same time. Dutch Harbor can be regarded as a representative of the defensive situation on the northwest coast of the United States, because there is only a naval radio station and a coastal defense team there. According to the Washington Treaty, the United States is not allowed to establish defenses in the Philippines, Guam, and the Aleutian Islands. However, if the naval negotiations break down in the future, the Navy Department has seriously considered establishing a naval base in Dutch Harbor. The Navy Department has conducted multiple inspections of the area, and after the exercises next year, some international issues can also be resolved. (19th National Telegram)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) It is reported that the Japanese government has proposed to the Soviet Russian government to jointly withdraw military equipment from the border between the two countries. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the following opinion: When Ambassador Ota stationed in Russia met with Stromnikov on August 30, he pointed out that Russian aircraft often crossed the border and that strange incidents often occurred. The borders between the United States and Canada have established peaceful relations because they are undefended. On the contrary, disputes have occurred on the border between France and Germany due to military equipment. In order to maintain peace on the border, it was said that Russia has recently needed to withdraw the military facilities added to the border area, arousing Russia's attention. However, there was no concrete proposal such as applying the Treaty of Portsmouth. As for the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty proposed by the Russian side, because both countries have signed the Kellogg-Briand Pact, the timing is not yet ripe, and reservations have been made. However, the Japanese government has proposed the establishment of a joint border commission, which will peacefully resolve disputes occurring on the border. The Russian side has no objection in principle to this proposal, so Russia should also consider withdrawing the Red Army from the border with Manchuria on its own initiative.

It is heard that this is the main point of the speech made by Russian representative Litvinov at a private banquet today, with French Foreign Minister Bartou also present. It is rumored that the Foreign Ministers of Russia and France are currently negotiating a mutual assistance treaty between Russia and France to replace the current failed Eastern Locarno Treaty. However, inquiries were made everywhere at 4:00 p.m. today, and this statement has not been confirmed. Although France advocates that any treaty must not go beyond the scope of the League of Nations treaty, such a treaty is not absolutely impossible. Bartou resumed negotiations with Litvinov this evening and has set off to return to Paris. (19th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Bartou Delivers a Speech</p>
<p>Saying that the Soviet Union's Joining the League Is Beneficial to World Peace</p>
<p>To Achieve Disarmament, One Must First Reshape People's Hearts</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations News Association, organized by newspaper reporters from various countries stationed in Geneva, hosts a banquet for the executive councilors of the League of Nations and the president of the League of Nations General Assembly once a year. The League of Nations General Assembly Chairman, Swedish Foreign Minister Sandler, urged the League of Nations newspaper reporters to help the cause of peace. French Foreign Minister Bartou claimed to be a predecessor of the newspaper reporters present, saying (Regarding the duties of a reporter, there is something to be told to you. Recently, a major international event has occurred. You should comment on it from an international perspective, and you must not be confined to the views of one country. However, among you, there are those who do not follow this path and use the relations of one country as the standard for criticism, and there are also those who involve the domestic politics of one's own country with the domestic politics of other countries. This matter is known to me by the Swiss representative Morda. Morda explained to me in sincere words at the League of Nations General Assembly the reasons why Switzerland could not approve the Soviet Union's joining the League, saying that Swiss newspapers had the most severe criticism of the Soviet Union. You should know that slandering foreign countries and their representatives with words is not only a loss of the hospitality of the host, but also violates the simplest etiquette that newspaper reporters should abide by. France does not want to advise any country, nor does it want to accept the advice of any other country, especially when it comes to international integrity. I do not hesitate to say this clearly here). Speaking of the Soviet Union's joining the League, Bartou jokingly said that some people said he was the (godfather) of Russia, but he was willing to be a commoner for the Soviet Union to be stationed at the League of Nations. Bartou continued, (I and the entire French government agree to support the eight alliances of the Soviet Union. This matter is extremely difficult. Fortunately, it has been completed today. I met Litvinov at the Genoa Conference in 1922. Today's Litvinov seems to have changed his old appearance. This is what I sincerely dare to tell you. If the Soviet Union's joining the League has the danger of causing chaos and war, then we will never approve the act of joining the League. Our actions in recent days are precisely because we believe that the Soviet Union is enough to benefit peace. The world is currently going through a great panic. If the Disarmament Conference wants to work effectively, it must first reshape people's hearts and eliminate mankind's warlike psychology before it can be done) and so on. Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov thanked the hosts and Bartou of the public banquet, and said that the international press should strive for peace. (19th Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>Saying that the Union of Russia and France Wants to Isolate Germany</p>
<p>The League of Nations Adopts This Strategy Only to Accelerate Its Own Collapse</p>
<p>(Berlin) A semi-official diplomatic commentary refuted the remarks made by Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov at the League of Nations General Assembly yesterday about the crisis of war, saying that alarming words were originally the means of Communist propaganda. Litvinov is now only trying to internationalize the anti-fascist movement. The words of Russian Foreign Minister, with their hidden meanings, are very foolish, and what he said is nothing more than the mantra of the Soviet Russian newspaper. The Russian Foreign Minister hates Germany and only wants to unite with France. When the League of Nations passed the Soviet Union's membership, the French newspaper directly said that isolating Germany was the main goal of Geneva's strategy. Litvinov's blood-spitting remarks were the first disappointment after Russia joined the League of Nations. What Germany expected was to live in peace with others. Foreign Minister Neurath said yesterday that the words of those who say that Germany is conspiring to start trouble are nothing more than malicious slanders. If the League of Nations also uses this as a strategy, it will only accelerate its collapse. (20th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The German newspapers only carried a small part of the speech given by Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov at the League of Nations General Assembly yesterday, but we can see from the commentary in the Political and Foreign Traffic News that the German authorities have not been unaffected by some of Litvinov's words. The newspaper said, (Litvinov accused several countries without explicitly saying which countries they were. This kind of calm language is very heavy. The Soviet Union's expression of opposition to Germany is absolutely approved by France. The main meaning of the fit between Paris and Moscow should not be anything other than this. However, in our opinion, the Russian Foreign Commissar's speech has absolutely no need to use this attacking tone.) The newspaper commented on Foreign Minister Neurath's speech at the International Road Conference today, saying that (Germany has done its best to seek peace in Europe, and has made suggestions to help peace. If outsiders still accuse Germany of having war plans, then we can only say that those who say this are deliberately malicious. The League of Nations claims to maintain peace, and the method it uses is like this, and the result is only to accelerate its demise). (19th Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>(Moscow) Newspapers worldwide are commenting on the invitation to the Soviet Union to join the League of Nations.  The (Paris) *Times* stated that the major powers have already felt the necessity of cooperating and uniting with all countries in order to maintain and create peace. Some French newspapers pointed out that Litvinov's willingness to regulate the spirit of the League Covenant and the Kellogg-Briand Pact is entirely consistent with France's security proposals. The *Manchester Guardian* said that the Soviet Union's entry into the League is the most important move in history and will surely consolidate the position of peace. Romanian newspapers welcomed this new international event.  The *Curentul* pointed to this as a turning point in world politics and emphasized the unity of the major powers in this event. Scandinavian newspapers regarded the invitation to the Soviet Union to join the League and to serve as a permanent council member as a major victory for Soviet diplomacy. German newspapers generally did not comment on this, but the military organ *Deutsche Wehr* expressed its frank and open anti-Soviet stance. Japanese newspapers only disclosed the invitation message without comment.  The Harbin *Manchuria Daily News* took advantage of this news from Geneva to launch a new anti-Soviet attack.

<p>Military Equality Not Achieved</p>
<p>Participation in Eastern European Pact Decidedly Difficult</p>
<p>Seeking Fair Resolution of the Saar Issue</p>
<p>(Berlin) At the closing of the International Road Congress, Foreign Minister Neurath delivered a lengthy speech.  Yesterday's telegram mentioned that Neurath's speech touched upon the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact.  The following is a supplementary record.  Neurath said, "It is quite difficult for us to join the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact. According to the initiators of the pact, it seems that the purpose of the pact is only to equally guarantee the peace of all countries. However, it is generally speculated that if this pact fails, France and the Soviet Union will decide to conclude a bilateral alliance treaty. If this statement is credible, then our disapproval is even more justified." In short, Germany must first obtain the right to military equality before it can participate in the principles of the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact. Neurath then said that since the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, there has been a mania for concluding international treaties. Whenever something happens, treaties are used to deal with it, but this is not a good method. Regarding the Saar issue, Neurath believed that the unfairness of the peace treaty to Germany will inevitably be remedied after the plebiscite. There is no doubt about this. After the Foreign Minister, National Road Inspector Todt delivered a brief speech, stating, "You have already heard the opinions of the German political authorities. You should know that the Foreign Minister's speech today is a statement of intent to openly discuss with you various issues related to the German people." Most of the ambassadors and ministers from various countries were present. The next International Road Congress is scheduled to be held in the Netherlands in 1938. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Foreign Minister Neurath spoke today at the International Road Congress here, regarding all the diplomatic and economic problems encountered by the German government, saying that Germany's diplomatic policy is entirely dedicated to peace. What Germans need is friendship with other countries, thereby consolidating the work of the National Socialist government and making it last far into the future. We now put forward two positive demands that we insist on and must realize: (1) Regarding armaments, we must receive equal treatment. (2) The resolution of the Saar issue must be in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles and its political reasons. The reason why Germany withdrew from the League of Nations was because it failed to obtain equal status. Establishing equal rights is the indispensable foundation for cooperation between Germany and other countries. If the League of Nations is to become a true organization for maintaining peace in the future, then far-reaching reforms are essential. The Soviet Union's entry into the League of Nations is worthy of attention in the development of the political situation. However, since we have already left the League of Nations, we do not want to discuss this matter. Although we are always pleased to see that our international affairs can obtain the cooperation of various countries. At this point, Neurath spoke about the Saar issue, saying that the core of the Saar issue has been lost to international discussion. Although France failed to force the Allied countries to allow it to annex the Saar, in 1919 France was able to separate the Saar from Germany and also obtain the coal mines of the Saar. The reason France put forward in Versailles was that the Saar residents were of mixed race and that the coal mines in southern France had been completely destroyed in the war, so it requested that the coal of the Saar be used as compensation. Today, if we discuss the value of this reason again, it will be a waste of words and will not help the matter. The Saar residents have been purely German since ancient times. This has been the case for 1,200 years. As for the coal mines, we do not want to say much. As of 1925, the coal produced in southern France was already more than before the war, and the coal paid by Germany in reparations is not included in this example. The coal Germany transported to France was also more than the total output lost by the French coal mines. France has mined a total of 180 million tons of Saar coal from 1920 to the present, while the losses suffered in the war were only 70 million tons. Even as stated in the Treaty of Versailles, it must be returned to its original owner after fifteen years. The Saar will hold a plebiscite in a few months, and at that time it will be known that the resolution of 1919 was not a fair method. What we must admit is that the return of the Saar to Germany is the only solution. Other methods are nothing more than repeating the mistake of 1919. After recently reviewing some suggestions, I have to solemnly declare that all Germans should not discuss any methods that discriminate against Germany's sovereignty, because this method will not only violate the spirit of the Treaty of Versailles, but also harm the future development of international relations. Neurath finally assured the audience that the German government is determined to protect the interests of the German people and to be a sound element in maintaining peace in Europe.

Representatives from several countries agreed with this proposal. However, Swiss Foreign Minister Dr. Motta rose to say that if any country arbitrarily abandons treaties that are inconvenient to it, such as Poland's recent actions regarding minority treaties, then the League of Nations will not be able to survive for long. It is not advisable to convene a meeting as proposed by the Polish representative at this time. This kind of meeting has no hope of success from the beginning. (Reuters, 20th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) French Finance Minister Germain Martin spoke here today, saying that France's international position has improved. The Soviet Union's entry into the League of Nations can help eliminate disasters. He feels that progress towards peace has never been as great as it is today. According to Martin, he initially supported the provisions of the French budget bill, so that France, when necessary, could increase its military spending with a special item. Martin said that if the international situation becomes more serious and there is a need to increase armaments, then it would be better to set up a special armament item, as in 1913, otherwise the income will eventually be insufficient to pay for military expenses.

<p>(Tokyo) Former Minister to Greece, Shintaro Kawashima, under the order of Foreign Minister Hirota, will go to Manchuria in early October to inspect the economic and industrial situation.

<p>(New York) Cuba's revolutionary conspiracy is spreading widely. According to private telegrams obtained here from Santiago and Havana, opposition to the Mendieta government is increasing on all sides. The Cuban people, because revolutionary coups have long been commonplace, are also prepared to accept whatever comes. The recent hospitality shown to General Mario García Menocal, the former Cuban dictator, by President Trujillo of the Dominican Republic in Cuba's neighboring Dominican Republic, has made Cuba quite uneasy. According to news from Havana, Trujillo is suspected of funding Menocal's revolutionary conspiracy. In addition, various opposition leaders in Cuba are also eager to try. The United States government recently ordered a ban on the transportation of arms to anyone in Cuba, except for the Cuban government. This is a sign of stability. It is said that President Mendieta's position is no longer what it used to be. In the past, all parties supported Mendieta, but now they are opposing him one by one. Mendieta has repeatedly said that he will formally elect a president next January, but whether it can be implemented is still questionable. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>

All the newspapers in Yugoslavia also joined in. Italian newspapers were unwilling to remain silent, so the two sides attacked each other. A few days ago, the Inter-Parliamentary Union of Commerce held a meeting in the Yugoslav capital, and Italy did not send a representative to participate, precisely because of this reason. The Italian government has recently formally protested the article in the *Yugoslav Times*. It is expected that the war of words between the two sides will end here. People here say that the two newspapers have stopped arguing for a month. Now it is a pity that Rome suddenly filed a protest out of helplessness. (Havas, 19th)</p>

<p>Lhasa Welcomes Mr. Huang, a Great Taboo for the British</p>
<p>Saying the Situation in Tibet is Extremely Urgent</p>
<p>Britain has always regarded Tibet as its exclusive domain. After the passing of the Dalai Lama last year, the Tibetans sent a Lama delegation to Beijing to welcome the Panchen Lama back to Tibet to preside over the government, and expressed their sincerity of inward orientation. Therefore, the Central Government specially appointed Huang Musong as an envoy to go to Tibet to express condolences and pay respects to the Dalai Lama. According to a recent telegram from Envoy Huang, he was warmly welcomed upon arriving in Lhasa, which became a great taboo for the British. Last week, the local "North China Daily News" published a London dispatch summarizing the "Times" commentary on Tibetan affairs. Its remarks were full of provocative intent. Yesterday, the newspaper reprinted a London dispatch from September 19 on this issue. The British resentment of Tibet's allegiance to the Central Government is increasingly evident, yet they still try to conceal it, which can be described as a futile attempt to cover up the truth. I have translated its telegram below for your consideration:</p>
<p>A reporter (from the "North China Daily News") learned that the Chinese officials in Britain were quite surprised and disappointed by the British reaction to the Chinese envoy's visit to Lhasa. They felt that General Huang Musong's mission was greatly misunderstood by the British, and their criticism was rather unfair. However, British observers of Sino-Tibetan affairs believe that General Huang's proclamation in Lhasa on September 13 was largely due to the Chinese government's desire to use the opportunity of the Dalai Lama's funeral to make a public gesture to impress the bordering territories, hoping to offset the loss of prestige caused by the loss of Manchuria. China's feelings on this matter were probably provoked by Tibet's recent increasing inclination towards India. India's trade with Tibet is now of paramount importance, while China's trade with Tibet, apart from tea, is negligible. British political observers say that in recent years, a section of the Chinese newspapers has often accused Britain of harboring ambitions to annex Tibet. Britain naturally regards this as a joke and has repeatedly solemnly denied it. However, the recent invitation from the Tibetans to Sir Charles Bell (leader of the British diplomatic mission to Lhasa in 1920) to visit Lhasa, the rising prestige of Tibetan engineer Lingong, who is believed to have studied in Rugby, England, and is building Tibet's first factory, is now purchasing British machinery to establish an electric power plant in Lhasa, and the former commander-in-chief of the Tibetan army, Longxia, who was accused of conspiring to exclude Chinese influence and was thus deprived of his eyes, all these may have aroused Nanjing's jealousy. Judging from various signs here, the situation in Tibet today is extremely tense. The reincarnation of the deceased Dalai Lama cannot be determined within two or three years. During the Dalai Lama's lifetime, he personally controlled all secular affairs. In the future, there will be no outstanding figure who can serve as the leader of Tibet for a while, and the progressive and conservative factions of the Tibetan Parliament are constantly in conflict, and it is easy for suspicions of foreign interference to arise in the Parliament.</p>

<p>Shibayama Goes to Tianjin to Meet with Yu</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Miyakoshi Gozo, a Japanese merchant in the Malanyu Allied Forces, shipped a boat of goods from Tangshan on September 6, intending to supply the Japanese army in Malanyu. When he arrived at Lintoutun, at the intersection of Yutian, Fengrun, and Zunhua counties, he was mistaken for bandits by the local militia on guard. Militiaman Wu Runbi fired without authorization, killing Miyakoshi. After this incident occurred, Asami, the commander of the Japanese garrison in Tangshan, immediately protested to Tao Shangming, the Administrative Commissioner of Luan and Yu. Tao went to Ping on the 12th to discuss the matter with Shibayama. On the 13th, he came to Tianjin and visited Omaki Ryogi, the senior staff officer of the garrison army. Omaki said that it would be necessary to wait for the report from the Tangshan garrison to arrive and learn the truth before negotiations could begin. Tao returned to Tangshan on the evening of the 16th, specializing in investigating the conflict between the farmers of Fushan Temple in Qian'an and the Japanese and Korean vagrants. Negotiations on the Miyakoshi murder case were temporarily suspended. On the 13th of this month, the Tangshan branch of the Japanese Consulate General's Police Station dispatched a former senior inspector to Lintoutun, Yutian, to investigate the truth of the case. He returned to Tangshan on the 16th. According to his report, Wu Runbi, the militiaman who fired the shot, has indeed fled in fear of punishment and his whereabouts are unknown. The inspector intends to collect all relevant materials before reporting to Tianjin. Asami, the commander of the Japanese garrison in Tangshan, also dispatched 30 infantrymen led by a platoon leader to Lintoutun, Yutian, on the 16th to investigate, and returned to Tangshan on the 17th. Shibayama Kenjiro, the military attaché of the Japanese embassy, was scheduled to come to Tianjin from Ping on the 18th to visit Yu Xuezhong, the chairman of Hebei, to negotiate this matter. Before our side began negotiations, we had already recovered Miyakoshi Gozo's body and the lost one boat of goods. Chen Bao, the magistrate of Yutian County, dispatched personnel to send them to Tangshan, and then Tao Shangming forwarded them to the Japanese side. Regarding the negotiations on this case, Japanese Consul Tanaka stated to our side that he would not be responsible for the negotiations, saying that it was within the scope of the North China Garrison Army and should be negotiated directly with that department. Asami, the commander of the Japanese garrison in Tangshan, expressed a tough stance on this and demanded numerous conditions. Because Tao Shangming found the negotiations difficult, he went directly to negotiate with the North China Garrison Army, but the Japanese military department seemed to be indifferent and unwilling to negotiate with us. Shibayama, the military attaché of the Japanese embassy, went directly to Yu Xuezhong, the chairman, to negotiate, causing confusion. However, because the Japanese side had already indicated that it would discuss this issue after the Qian'an incident was resolved, our current attitude is very calm. (17th)</p>

<p>One-third of Staff to Be Laid Off in Various Departments</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Chiang ordered the provincial governments in various bandit suppression areas to implement joint office to achieve unified authority. Now, Jiangxi Province has decided to implement it on the 21st. One-third of the staff is expected to be laid off from the four departments of Civil Affairs, Finance, Construction, and Education, as well as the Provincial Government Secretariat and the two Security Departments. All the saved funds will be used to strengthen county governments and lower-level organs to avoid being top-heavy and foot-light. The original order and outline of the joint office method have already been promulgated. The text of the order is as follows: (It has been verified that this government previously received the Nanchang Camp of the Military Affairs Committee's outline of the provincial government's joint office method and instructed to comply with it. We have actively prepared for it and it is now ready. Joint office will be implemented on the 21st of this month. From that day onwards, official documents to the outside world will all use the name of this government. All documents submitted by agencies directly under this government should be submitted directly to this government. However, the various departments have the authority to issue their own departmental orders regarding the supervision and direction of the operation of subordinate agencies, within the scope that does not conflict with provincial orders. In addition, the Provincial Health Department, Land Bureau, and Provincial Disaster Relief Association should be guided by the Civil Affairs Department, the Bandit Suppression Post-Disaster Donation Management Bureau should be guided by the Finance Department, and the Rural Cooperation Committee and the Agricultural College should be guided by the Construction Department. The Nanchang and Jiujiang Municipal Committees and the Lushan Administration should be guided by their respective competent authorities. In addition to submitting separate reports and orders, a copy of the camp's instructions and the outline of the provincial government's joint office method is issued for your compliance. This order.)

<h3 id="e91">Analysis of the Naval Conference by Japan (Japanese Correspondence) <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Great Powers in the Eyes of the Japanese</p>
<p>Preparations in Foreign Policy</p>
<p>The so-called crisis of 1936 was first proclaimed by Japan, and it tried its best to artificially deepen its extent. Now 1936 is almost upon us. After the first failure of the London Naval Preparatory Conference, the future is bleak and not optimistic. At this time, Japanese naval officers are deliberately preparing, but they are also paying considerable attention to diplomacy, and are no longer willing to fall into the past predicament of being isolated from the world. According to the naval authorities' analysis of the claims of the four main countries in the world regarding the Washington and London treaties, as follows:</p>
<p>(1) It believes that Britain has no intention of changing the London Naval Treaty and the Washington Naval Treaty in terms of quantity, and even intends to continue the treaty in principle. However, there are two opinions in terms of quality: one is to change the current 35,000-ton battleships to 25,000 tons, and the gun caliber is also reduced accordingly; the other is to increase Britain's existing heavy cruisers and light cruisers, from 50 ships to 70 ships.</p>
<p>(2) The United States is the initiator of the Washington Treaty, and its main opinion is to maintain the two treaties. It is very different from Britain's claim. Reducing the tonnage of battleships is beneficial to Britain, but the opposite is true for the United States. Increasing cruisers is also the same, putting the United States in a passive position. Therefore, it advocates extending the naval treaty, or further reducing the existing forces. (3) France has no preference for the claims of Britain and the United States, and its relationship with Japan is also not trivial. What it wants is only equality with Italy on the surface. Between France and Italy, battleships and aircraft carriers are equal, but the French navy is actually dominant. Therefore, it is unwilling to abolish the naval treaty immediately.</p>
<p>(4) Italy is satisfied as long as it is nominally equal to the French navy, because it has financial difficulties and its colonies are limited. Maritime development is only in the Mediterranean. If the naval treaty is abolished and countries start to compete in building navies, Italy will feel the difficulty of coping. Therefore, it does not support abolishing the naval treaty.</p>
<p>According to the above analysis, none of the major countries support abolishing the naval treaty. Isn't Japan going to be in a dilemma? However, it believes that it is very difficult to reconcile Britain and the United States. It will use the discord between Britain and the United States to try its best to sabotage it, and must prevent them from putting forward a new joint proposal. At the same time, it will pay closer attention to the attitudes of Britain and the United States. Now Japan's strategy is that no matter what the opinions of the above four countries are, and regardless of whether the preparatory meeting can succeed, it will propose the abolition of the Washington and London treaties.</p>
<p>Its active claims are: first, it believes that Article 23 of the Washington Treaty, regarding the principle of ratioism, must be abolished. As for the most appropriate time to propose abolition, it is before December 31 of this year; second, it is necessary to establish national defense security, quickly get rid of the shackles of existing unfavorable treaties, and conclude new arms reduction treaties based on the absolute equality of the right to national survival. It is necessary to completely abolish the maintenance of a high degree of armaments and the superiority of armaments in a certain country. Therefore, in the future, the differential ratio should be abolished immediately, and the right of each country to national defense autonomy should be respected, and the reduction of naval armaments should be based on total tonnage. This is the high-sounding statement currently advocated by the Japanese government. Judging from the general situation in Japan, it will never be allowed to cause naval shipbuilding competition with Britain and the United States again. In fact, it is using this kind of high-sounding statement to resist involvement in the political problem, solidify its hegemony in the Far East, and implicitly divide Britain and the United States. We see that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been openly training its diplomats in major European and American countries, instructing them to state to the countries where they are stationed: (1) Japan is sincerely maintaining world peace and wants to reduce the burden on its people and implement arms reduction; (2) Japan intends to reduce offensive weapons such as aircraft carriers and battleships; (3) Japan believes that the principle of ratioism in the Washington Treaty is not suitable for the times, so it advocates equality of armaments among Britain, the United States, and Japan, and advocates that all countries should use total tonnage as the basis for further arms reduction. Such use of diplomatic means is intended to gain the sympathy of Britain, France, and Italy, or at least the goodwill of France and Italy. However, it is very clear that this task is not easy to accomplish and must be dealt with by all parties. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has initiated the organization of an Arms Reduction Information Committee to assist in the progress of arms reduction. The committee is jointly organized by Amau, the director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and two section chiefs, Noda, the chairman of the Navy Popularization Committee, and two colonels, and Kudo and Shin, the leaders of the Army Research Committee. It meets once a week to specialize in information work and closely liaises with Japanese military attachés and diplomats stationed in various countries, instructing them on the current needs and points to be noted. These messages are combined to plan a strategy for arms reduction. (September 14, 1934, Tokyo)</p>
<h3 id="e92">Recent Bandit Suppression Situation in Southern Fujian <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Xiao Jing's Report to the Press</p>
<p>Blockade of Bandit Areas Actively Underway</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: After taking office in Quanzhou, Xiao Jing, the commander of bandit suppression in Southern Fujian, immediately convened a bandit suppression meeting of county magistrates from Quanzhou, Zhangzhou, Xingning, and Yongchun, and focused his efforts on clearing the bandits and communists in Anningyong (i.e., Anxi, Yongchun, and Nan'an counties), because these three counties are where the bandits and communists are most complex and numerous. Xiao came to Xiamen from Quanzhou on the 16th and told reporters about the recent situation of bandit suppression in Anningyong: "The bandits and communists in the three counties are mainly in Anxi, and the situation is complex. There are no less than dozens of gangs of bandits in Anxi, among which the gangs of Lu Zhenshan, Guo Zongzhan, and Fang Zhen are more prominent. These three gangs have about two to three thousand people, and the others are mostly scattered bandits, which will be easy to eliminate. The bandits' nests are in the west of Anxi, the east of Hua'an and Zhangping, and the interior is also extremely complex. There are often internal firefights, because if there is an uneven distribution of the spoils from kidnapping and robbery, they will meet each other with artillery fire," etc. Subsequently, representatives of refugees from Anxi fellow villagers in Xiamen and various townships in Anxi, such as Zhuo Yuanhu and Qiu, went to Xiao's residence (Tianxian Hostel) to petition for troops to suppress the bandits. Xiao came out to comfort them and they dispersed. That evening, the Xiamen Chamber of Commerce hosted a banquet for Xiao, during which Lin Qicheng, the representative of Anxi, reported on the bandit situation in Anxi, saying that in the past two weeks, more than 300 people had been kidnapped and extorted for ransom, and they were all stripped naked to prevent them from escaping, which was an unprecedented example of kidnapping in Southern Fujian. Other instances of burning, killing, and looting are too numerous to mention. The people of Anxi are really in dire straits, and the number of refugees fleeing to Xiamen is increasing day by day, etc. The Bandit Suppression Department has dispatched Ma Hongxing, the commander of the 3rd Security Regiment, to handle the affairs of the bandits and communists in Anningyong, and he set off on the 16th to Yongchun to suppress them. All the security regiments in the three counties are under Ma's command. In addition to suppressing the bandits and communists in Quanzhou and Yongchun, the Bandit Suppression Department is also strictly enforcing a blockade. Quanzhou's smuggled salt is also flooding Anxi and being smuggled into bandit areas, no less than 6,000 catties per day. Xiao Jing recently found out and telegraphed the provincial government on the 15th, saying, "According to the report of Dong Yihuang, the inspector stationed in Anxi to blockade the bandit area, smuggled salt is flooding Anxi, coming from Tong'an via Longmen, and from Anhai via Xiwei, averaging more than 6,000 catties per day, entering Datian Dehua, and transferred to bandit areas. On the same day, the county police in Anxi's Cannai arrested dozens of salt smugglers, who dared to open fire to resist arrest. Xie Shuikuo and Xie Hanlin were arrested, and 25 dans of smuggled salt, weighing 1,795 catties, were seized. The salt criminals have been handed over to the county government for detention," etc. In addition to ordering them to be escorted to the department for strict handling, I report, Xiao Jing.)

<h3 id="e93">New County Governance Established in Yunnan Province <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Weixin Changes County Name to Weixin County</p>
<p>Jinhe and Pinghe Merged into Jinping County</p>
<p>Areas Under Lancang Changed to Establishment Zone</p>
<p>Kunming Correspondence: Yunnan Province has a vast area and inconvenient transportation. In addition to the existing 109 counties, 1 city, and 15 establishment bureaus, there are still many remote border areas that are related to national defense or border several counties, and governance is inconvenient. In order to reorganize administrative regions and promote administrative efficiency, the provincial government has decided to transfer the three jia of Shangshu, except for the five- and one-fortress, under the jurisdiction of Zhenxiong, and delineate Shazipo behind Banjugou Liangzibei as the boundary; the middle east, except for the second, fourth, and fifth jia, and then delineate the lower half jia of Shui Tianzhai, the third jia of Zhongdong, with the river as the boundary, to be transferred to Weixin for management and transfer, that is, to establish Weixin as the county seat, and still use the name Weixin, classified as a third-class county, and the original administrative committee will be abolished. The provincial government has issued a clear order to announce it, and selected and appointed a county magistrate to go to receive and establish it. It is hoped that the regional disputes that have been disputed for many years in the two counties can be completely resolved. In addition, the two establishment bureaus of Jinhe and Pinghe are adjacent to Vietnam, and national defense and diplomacy are of great importance. It has been decided to merge the two regions, change the establishment to a county governance, and improve the regime to control it and consolidate the border. It has been found that the total population of the two regions is more than 9,000 households, and the area is also very wide, which is more than enough to set up a county. This time, the merger and change of the county, named Jinping, Mengding has now been changed to Pinghe, so it is named Jinping, temporarily designated as a third-class county. As for the candidate for county magistrate, because it is the first change of county governance, those who are not highly qualified and knowledgeable cannot be competent. The Civil Affairs Department has approved the provincial government to select and appoint Ge Yanchun, the former section chief of the Fourth Section of the Department and the current Political Inspector of the First District, to serve as the county magistrate, and the provincial government committee has approved the appointment after discussion. Ge can go to receive and establish the county governance within days after accepting the appointment. In addition, the four places of Mengjiao, Mengdong, Daoxiang, Haiyan, and Shuai under the jurisdiction of Canglan County are adjacent to Myanmar, with a vast area and many indigenous people under the jurisdiction of the chieftain's office. Because of inconvenient transportation, backward culture, and difficult governance, there are also important relationships with border defense. It is not enough to control it and consolidate the border without setting up a governance as soon as possible. Now, the above four places have been changed to an establishment zone, named Cangyuan, which has also been approved by the provincial government, and Gong Sheng has been appointed as the special commissioner in charge of preparing for the establishment of Cangyuan. He will go to prepare for the establishment on a given date. According to statistics, the wooden seals and seals of the two counties and one establishment zone recently established have been sent by the Civil Affairs Department to the provincial government for initial publication to ensure good faith. After the establishment is established, the facts will be listed separately and submitted to the Ministry of Interior Affairs as a special case, and forwarded to the Executive Yuan for verification and record, and copper seals will be issued to Yunnan to facilitate forwarding and use.

<p>A Decrease Seen Compared to the Previous Month</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Since the drought in Jiangsu and Zhejiang and the soaring rice prices in Shanghai, Xiamen rice merchants have been competing to transport the stored rice from Zhangzhou to Shanghai for sale. As a result, the rice prices in Xiamen and Zhangzhou once soared by more than two yuan per dan. The Xiamen General Chamber of Commerce once decided to ban rice exports, but the customs authorities could not implement it because they had not received an order from the Ministry, and they continued to ship out rice in succession, but the numbers have been greatly reduced. The statistics of the export of Zhangzhou rice since August 3 are listed below: 130 bags on the Jinan Wheel on August 3, 1,630 bags on the Yuezhou Wheel on the 6th, 1,669 bags on the Fuping Wheel on the 8th, 4,469 bags on the Nanchang Wheel on the 9th, 1,584 bags on the Jinan Wheel on the 17th, 4,919 bags on the Hanjiang Wheel on the 19th, 2,427 bags on the Qingyuan Wheel on the 17th, 7,419 bags on the Yuji Wheel on the 20th, 4,296 bags on the Qiongzhou Wheel on the 20th, 1,984 bags on the Yuda Wheel on the 22nd, 6,257 bags on the Niuzhuang Wheel on the 24th, 3,035 bags on the Guangdong Wheel on the 28th, 7,051 bags on the Tongshang Wheel on the 28th, 4,421 bags on the Jinan Wheel on the 30th, another 5,675 bags on the Yisun Wheel, another 1,985 bags on the Jiahe Wheel, 3,200 bags on the Yuezhou Wheel on September 3, 8,119 bags on the Zhejiang Wheel on the 4th, 2,060 bags on the Luzhou Wheel on the 7th, 4,469 bags on the Nanchang Wheel on the 9th, 1,288 bags on the Hubei Wheel on the 10th, 548 bags on the Tonghua Wheel on the 12th, 150 bags on the Jinan Wheel on the 14th.

<h3 id="e96">Public and Legal Organizations in Wuxi Again Request Suspension of Urban Land Price Declaration <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government recently held urban land price declarations in Wuxi and Nantong counties. After hearing the news, all sectors of Wuxi opposed it. The request was not approved. The other day, public and legal organizations again sent telegrams to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, President Wang Jingwei, Provincial Chairman Chen, and Directors Yu and Zhao, requesting an immediate order to suspend the urban land price declaration. The original telegram is as follows: (Zhenjiang, Jiangsu Provincial Government Chairman Chen, Civil Affairs Director Yu, Finance Director Zhao Junjian: We received your government's order No. 19 of the Land Department, regarding our previous telegram requesting the suspension of land price declaration due to local hardship. The order stated: "Your telegram has been noted. Land price declaration is of utmost importance to national economy and people's livelihood. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek convened senior administrative personnel from all provinces in Nanchang in March of this year and repeatedly instructed them to plan for the immediate collection of urban land tax, emphasizing its great significance and the urgency of the work. The government, upholding Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's intention to create welfare for the people and closely observing the actual local situation, is conducting urban land price declarations to develop people's livelihood and promote social prosperity. This does not violate the grand principles of national reconstruction and can be expected to realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings at an early date. We hope you will understand this intention and provide your support. This order is hereby given." After receiving this order, we learned that Jiangsu Province is conducting urban land price declarations with the intention of creating welfare for the people as instructed by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. If it can indeed develop people's livelihood and promote social prosperity, we would naturally comply and would not dare to trouble you again. However, we recently saw a news report from Zhenjiang on the 4th of this month, which stated that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Nanchang Headquarters issued Directive No. 1244 of the Review Department. The second item in your government's instructions to Jiangsu Province stated: "Land survey is the starting point for land consolidation and an important task for completing self-government. It should be expedited within the possible scope to complete the task as soon as possible. The existing results of land investigation in Zhenjiang and other counties should be promoted to other counties to assist in tax consolidation." Furthermore, public and legal organizations in our county and both the Beijing and Shanghai native-place associations have successively received approvals from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Nanchang Headquarters, instructing them to directly submit their requests to the competent authorities in the province for review and handling. After carefully interpreting Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's directive, it seems that it is indeed based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, recognizing land survey as the starting point for land consolidation and confirming it as an important task for completing self-government. Even if urban land tax should be planned for collection, it is appropriate to start with land consolidation first. Since land survey is underway in Jiangsu Province, it is appropriate to strictly follow Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's directive, endeavoring to expedite land survey within the possible scope to complete self-government and realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. The reason why the Fundamentals of National Reconstruction stipulates land price declaration and the collection of land price tax as tasks for the beginning of self-government is that, at the beginning of self-government, the people, in accordance with the Fundamentals of National Reconstruction, must fulfill their obligations of paying land price tax and land value increment for the local area, and also have the right to directly elect and recall officials and create and reject laws. The rights and obligations are actually reciprocal. The true spirit of the Three Principles of the People lies in this, and the important significance of revolutionary work also lies in this. Moreover, what is collected from the local area is still used for the local area. Therefore, it is said that the entire county shares and the local area owns. Since self-government is based on the county as a unit, the determination of land price must be for the entire county before the local area can enjoy it, and then the entire county can realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. Realization depends on promoting self-government and is definitely not a matter for a partial corner of the city to declare and handle in advance. As for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's directive that land investigation should be promoted in Zhenjiang and other counties, it is not clear whether it is the same as the land price declaration currently being conducted in Wuxi and other places. We cannot speculate. However, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's directive is to assist in tax consolidation. Referring to the land investigation in Yixing and other counties as reported in the newspaper, any excess land is used to reduce the tax burden of the entire county. This is specifically for tax consolidation and to equalize the local burden. It should not be confused with the land price declaration currently being conducted in Wuxi and other places, which is for the collection of land price tax and land value increment tax. What the people are alarmed about is not the land price declaration itself, but the collection of land price tax and land value increment tax after the land price declaration. Recently, urban residents have been spreading rumors, saying that supervisors are bringing police to the door. If the head of the household is away on business, the declaration form is not handed over to the residents, and they are left to declare it themselves. Only women and children are briefly questioned, and the form is filled out on their behalf, ordering them to imprint or stamp it before leaving. If this is the case, can it be used as a basis for future taxation, and will the residents also recognize it as valid? This seems to be worth studying. Moreover, only if the local area can truly prosper can land value increase. The silk industry in Wuxi has failed, and agriculture and commerce have been in difficulty in recent years. Coupled with continuous years of disasters, land prices have undoubtedly fallen. How can simply declaring land prices develop people's livelihood? You, as leaders seeking to govern for the people, should be able to understand the people's suffering. We propose that you strictly follow Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's directive. If it is for land consolidation, you should immediately start land survey. If it is for tax consolidation, you should also conduct land investigation. Choose one of the two to conduct on a trial basis first. As for determining land prices and collecting land taxes, you should still follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and listen to local self-government. This will not violate the grand principles of national reconstruction and can be expected to realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. This matter concerns the well-being of the people, and it is difficult to remain silent. We believe that in a prosperous nation, the people's suffering should not be concealed. We hereby express our firm opinions again, hoping that you will adopt them and temporarily suspend the declaration to relieve the people's livelihood and honor the legacy. We are extremely apprehensive.

<p>The county's Anti-Smoking Committee stated that the deadline for registering smokers is the 15th of this month. As of now, only over 3,000 households have registered, indicating that the majority of smokers are taking a wait-and-see attitude. The deadline is rapidly approaching, and there will be no extensions after the deadline. Therefore, it has ordered the district offices and public security bureaus to instruct township chiefs and branch offices to implement forced registration, using effective methods to investigate and ensure that all smokers are registered. The district's opium dens have generally decided on how to establish sales and smoking locations, but the allocation decision must wait until after the registration deadline. The application deadline for sales and smoking locations is the 25th. Three opium warehouses should be established in the county, one each in the city, Fengjing, and Tinglin. Merchants handling these warehouses have applied to the county committee to report for approval. The position of director of the addiction treatment center has also been reported to the province for approval and appointment by the county committee. However, no instructions have been received from the provincial capital, so preparations have not yet begun.</p>

Song Wenbin left and never returned, and his whereabouts are unknown. Recently, Director Ye was ordered to hand over the funds, so he submitted a request to the county to pursue Song's guarantor, Jiang Zifu, for compensation. Jiang was summoned for questioning once and was guaranteed by Ye Jiugao of the Tongxing Rice Store. However, Jiang recently submitted a report to the county government, denying the guarantee. The matter is strange, so the county government will order the guarantor, Ye Jiugao, to surrender Jiang Zifu for interrogation and verification.</p>

<h3 id="e99">Autumn Rice Discovers Leafhoppers and Mold Spots <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>This year, the weather has been extremely dry, and most rice seedlings have withered. Less than 50% of the fields in the four townships have been able to pump water for transplanting. Recently, due to heavy autumn rains, leafhoppers have become even more severe in the rice paddies, and mold spots have appeared on the rice husks, which are hollow and without substance. The autumn harvest in low-lying fields is feared to be hopeless. Yesterday, Qian Sunqing, director of the County Funds and Property Office, specially attached a clump of autumn rice and requested that special attention be paid during the upcoming autumn inspection, not to assume that there is a harvest simply because all the fields appear to have rice. He also requested that the situation be investigated and reported to the province in advance.</p>

The representatives requested five points, and director Shen all expressed acceptance and promised to send personnel to Wuxi in the near future to consult with the Construction Bureau and convene representatives from the Long-Distance Bus Company and the Operating Automobile Trade Association to mediate an appropriate solution and urge them to resume business first. The representatives were satisfied and returned to Wuxi yesterday.</p>

<p>Song Taowei, the squad leader of the first squad of the first company of the county security team, was jointly accused by the soldiers of the team in separate submissions to the county government and the provincial security office. The accusations included Song smoking opium, abusing soldiers, and withholding pay. Director Xiang, based on the submission, ordered County Magistrate Bao to arrest him. On the 18th, Bao sent a trustworthy officer to the old county front to arrest Song's concubine, Yang Lao Da. However, Song jumped out of the window over the wall and climbed out of the city wall towards the north gate, escaping without a trace. County Magistrate Bao, believing that Song's flight in fear of punishment showed that the accusations were not false, specially submitted a report to the provincial office for his arrest.</p>

<p>Ships between Changzhou and Heqiao (Yixing jurisdiction) loaded passengers and cargo from Heqiao at 5:00 PM on the 18th and set sail for Changzhou as usual. Around 3:00 AM in the middle of the night when they were near the Fifteen-Hole Bridge, six robbers suddenly appeared on the shore. Four of them were armed with pistols, rushed up and seized the boatmen, forcing the boat to shore and firing shots to show their power. At this time, a ship from Tingqiao Bridge arrived, and the robbers split up and boarded the ship to search for valuables. All the cash hidden by the boat owners and passengers was robbed. Fortunately, no one was injured. After the robbery, the robbers went ashore and howled northward. The two ships arrived in Changzhou on the 19th and planned to report the case to the county government for investigation.</p>

<p>The Department of Civil Affairs has recently attached great importance to grain storage. If there is any embezzlement, misappropriation, theft, or profiteering, it will be severely punished without leniency. Recently, Zhan Zhengyuan, the clerk of the Yicang granary in Qingjiang County, was found to have stolen granary grain. The department ordered the county to investigate and confirmed the facts. It has already issued a notice to all counties to assist in the arrest and bring him to justice. In addition, Liu Xinpu of the Food Management Committee of Baoying County, sold grain without the approval of the county or the department. The department sent a representative to the county to verify the facts and ordered the county to arrest him, order him to be responsible for recovering the grain, and then discuss further punishment.</p>

<p>The Jiangdu Hotel Industry Association stated that Zhu Wuchong, a patrol officer of the Fourth Public Security Substation, has been nitpicking on the hotel industry more than once. On the evening of the 17th, he again led a police officer to inspect a hotel and insisted that Bu Shaoquan and Ms. Yang, a legally married couple in Room 11 of the Tiancheng Hotel, were engaged in improper conduct. Although Tian Shuzi, the manager of the hotel, stated that Bu lived in Lidianzhen and was currently a partner in the Xin Dachang Grocery Store in Ten Lane, and that his wife, Ms. Yang, had come to the city and was staying at the hotel, the patrol officer yelled at Tian ("Who do you think you are to interfere?") and ordered Bu and his wife and Tian to be taken to the station together, intending to fine them. Fortunately, Han, a section chief of the General Administration, made a fair judgment and ordered Tian to return. Bu was urged out of the hotel by Tiancheng. Yesterday, Bu's younger brother, Youquan, came from his hometown with a marriage certificate and requested the association's assistance. On the 19th, at 12:00 noon, the association convened a temporary meeting. Liu Jifu, Tian Shuzi, Cao Songling, Li Heru, Zhou Lansun and thirteen other people attended and decided on the following measures: (1) In terms of judicial affairs, Bu will file a lawsuit himself. If necessary, those in the industry who witnessed the arrest can participate as witnesses. (2) In terms of party and government affairs, Bu will take the lead in submitting complaints separately, which will be co-signed by those present today to achieve the goal of removing the patrol officer to avoid disturbing travelers and affecting business. (3) Representatives present today will accompany Bu to the county government party headquarters to petition. (4) Zhou Lansun is responsible for helping Bu handle the case. (5) If the party, government, and judicial aspects cannot be resolved satisfactorily, they may continue to appeal to the province and call a general meeting of all members to seek more decisive measures. (6) Regarding the expenses for the negotiations, each attending household will pay according to the old regulations. It is also reported that the case has been referred to the Jiangdu Branch Court for investigation. The marriage certificate was presented to the court and the judge ordered Bu Shaoquan and his wife to return home and await further questioning of Patrol Officer Zhu.</p>

<p>Zhang Caifu from Qidong Antougang was a cook at Yao Shaofu's shipyard in Shanghai. On the 12th of this month, he returned to Qidong on the Baohua Steamer of the Ping An Company. However, the steamer ran aground on a sandbar in Sanhegang, causing the ship to list. Zhang was in the steerage and was crushed by an oil drum, breaking his right arm. He was barely breathing and in critical condition at the time. He was then transported to Antougang by boat, carried home, and died on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. Yesterday, his brother, Zhang Yougou, entrusted lawyer Zhang Huansheng to submit a request to the county government for investigation and attached a private lawsuit, demanding that the company be ordered to compensate for all losses in the amount of 3,120 yuan.</p>

<p>Chang Guanglin from Sichuan, currently residing in Beiping, is 26 years old and graduated from the University of Paris in France. After returning to China in 1932, he worked as a staff member of the Kunming Municipal Government in Yunnan. He later resigned for some reason and was unemployed at home. This summer, he came to Shanghai to seek employment but was unsuccessful. He pawned all his luggage and clothes. The day before yesterday, he boarded the Baofeng Steamer to Haimen. When the ship reached the vicinity of Sanhegang, he suddenly jumped into the river, intending to commit suicide. Fortunately, a waiter saw him and immediately stopped the ship to rescue him, and he was saved. The passengers then donated 25 silver dollars as travel expenses for him to return to Beiping. Chang then boarded the original ship back to Shanghai.</p>

<p>San Dian Town, located in the west of the county, is adjacent to Jiaxing. It is remote and sparsely populated and often reports bandit alarms. Therefore, once dusk falls, boats disappear. On the night of the 18th, several bandit boats suddenly arrived with over a hundred bandits. They landed, called roll, and lined up to enter the market. First, dozens of bandits guarded the east and west ends of the market, holding guns and blowing whistles, intending to rob in separate groups. Fortunately, the town's security police station immediately telegraphed the county governments of both counties. The Jiaxing police brigade, aboard the Zhiguo warship, arrived early. The gang of bandits then fled. They passed through Tian Renzhuang Town and also wanted to try to land. Fortunately, the town's public security bureau and the core team of the defense团 were prepared early, so they fled again.</p>

<p>His wife, and close colleagues Zeng Zhongming also came.</p>
<p>He will stay in Shanghai for one or two days before returning to Nanjing.</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan, previously flew to Jiangxi with Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and attend a lecture at the military officer training group. Yesterday morning, after finishing his official duties, he went down the mountain to Xunyang with his wife, Madam Chen Bijun, and close colleagues Zeng Zhongming, took a Junkers giant plane from the Eurasia Aviation Corporation flying east. The plane flew from Shanghai to Xunyang at 6:00 AM yesterday morning, and took Wang and Sun and other people from Xunyang to fly east at about 11:00 AM on the same day. It arrived in Nanjing at noon. President Sun and other people got off the plane immediately. President Wang and Ms. Chen and Mr. Zeng left Nanjing by the original plane to Shanghai at about 1:00 PM in the afternoon. It arrived here at 3:35 PM and landed at Hongqiao Airport. After Wang got off the plane, he changed to a car and returned to his residence to rest. President Wang is scheduled to stay in Shanghai for one or two days, and then return to Nanjing to preside over government affairs. It is reported that Wang came to Shanghai this time to meet with Wang Chonghui, a judge of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, to discuss something. A Central News Agency reporter met Mr. Zeng Zhongming at Hongqiao Airport yesterday. According to Zeng, Wang's visit to Mount Lu this time was specifically to attend a lecture at the military officer training group, and there were no other tasks. As for the time when he met with Chairman Chiang, government affairs were naturally discussed, but there were no special issues to discuss. Wang's visit to Shanghai this time was to take a break in Shanghai while government affairs were relatively free, and there were no special tasks. He is scheduled to return to Nanjing in the next few days. As for the letter announced by the U.S. Senate Military Trade Investigation Committee from the DuPont Arms Company's representative in China, which stated that arms were sold to China in 1932, and that some Chinese officials and generals received commissions, Chairman Chiang and President Wang paid close attention after learning about it, and have now decided to conduct a thorough investigation.</p>

<p>20 yuan per person for those who have joined the Party.</p>
<p>Non-Party members will continue to request relief.</p>
<p>Xin Xinzhi said that the overseas Chinese who were expelled by Japan and returned to Shanghai yesterday received a letter from their representative Chen Fengqing from Nanjing, reporting on the petition process. He claimed that the suffering of the overseas Chinese compatriots had aroused the pity of the Central Party Headquarters, which agreed to provide relief, but only to formal party members. As for non-Party members, because they are outside the scope of the Party Headquarters, other methods must be found. As for himself, he is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai with representatives from the Central Party Headquarters on the special express train at 5:00 PM on the 20th to handle investigation procedures and issue relief funds. The details are as follows:</p>

<p>Among the overseas Chinese who have returned to the country, there are a total of forty-four formal party members (including twenty who have already returned to their hometowns to prepare for party membership). The Central side agreed to issue relief funds of 20 yuan per person to twenty-four formal party members. The remaining those who have already returned to their hometowns and pre-party members will be reported to the Central Committee for verification and approval after they have been verified. It is reported that personnel have been sent by Central Party Headquarters carrying funds, and together with representative Chen Fengqing, are scheduled to arrive on the special express train at 5:00 PM on the afternoon of the 20th. The funds should be issued today.</p>

<p>After receiving Chen Fengqing's report, the overseas Chinese who remained in Shanghai, those who have already joined the party were temporarily stable, but a part of non-party members, were very uneasy because there was no relief funding. It is reported that they still intend to request relief from the Municipal Government and the Wenzhou Native Place Association to avoid being stranded in a foreign land. Yesterday, the Municipal Government sent personnel to the overseas Chinese compatriots' residence to investigate everything.</p>

<p>Circular Posted at Various Stations by the Two Railways Bureau</p>
<p>Previously, the Two Railways Bureau found it difficult when various troops, using the railway for transportation, often did not follow prescribed procedures, failing to consult the Ministry of Military Affairs and the Ministry of Railways before requisitioning trains, and instead forcibly demanding loading and transportation. The Bureau reported the actual situation to the Ministry of Railways, requesting that it consult the Ministry of Military Affairs to issue a proclamation to be posted at various stations to prevent this. The original text of the Ministry of Military Affairs' proclamation reads: "Upon investigation, if military organizations or troops have transfer matters requiring the use of vehicles, they should follow the prescribed procedures and methods stipulated in the Railway Military Transport Regulations. They must not directly demand vehicle transportation from railway stations. For transportation via the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways, those departing from Beijing Station or Hangzhou Station, as well as stations along the Beijing-Hangzhou route, must first report to this Ministry, which will then request the Ministry of Railways to order the railway to prepare transportation. Those who do not comply with these procedures and directly demand trains from railway stations will be refused loading and transportation. Any acts of forcible requisitioning of trains will be investigated and punished according to law to uphold regulations. In addition to issuing separate orders, this proclamation is hereby issued for general knowledge, and all are expected to strictly comply without violation. This proclamation."</p>

<p>For Grain Storage to Prevent Famine</p>
<p>Agreed Upon with Five Banks</p>
<p>According to New Voice News Agency, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, recognizing that this year's autumn harvest in Taixing, Taizhou, Gaoyou, Yancheng, Xinghua, and other areas in northern Jiangsu is very abundant, while southern Jiangsu is suffering from drought and famine, has instructed Zhao Dihua, Director of the Department of Finance, to contact five banks in Shanghai – the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, Jiangsu Bank, and Farmers Bank of China – to borrow money for grain storage to prevent famine. The plan is to first purchase grain from rice-producing areas in northern Jiangsu.</p>

<p>Absolutely No Truth to the Rumor of Using American Loans to Exchange for Arms</p>
<p>No Need to Be Discouraged by Failing to Be Elected to the League of Nations</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan, arrived in Shanghai last morning at 7:30 a.m. via an overnight train from Beijing the previous evening at 11:00 p.m. He went directly to his private residence on Seymour Road to rest. Later, at around 10:00 a.m., he went to the Central Bank to work. In the afternoon at 4:00 p.m., he attended the board meeting of the Central Bank. Wu Tiecheng, the mayor of Shanghai, visited Kong Xiangxi yesterday evening and discussed matters for about 20 minutes before leaving. Kong Xiangxi then met with reporters and made the following remarks:</p>
<h3 id="e120">Thoroughly Investigate the Arms Commission Issue <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>According to Kong Xiangxi, regarding the announcement by the U.S. Senate's Munitions Investigation Committee concerning a letter from the DuPont arms company's representative in China, which claimed that when arms were sold to China, some Chinese officials and generals received commissions, Chiang Kai-shek and President Wang Jingwei have paid close attention to this matter. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has instructed Shi Zhaoji, the ambassador to the United States, to inform the U.S. Department of State and request that Senator Nye, chairman of the U.S. Senate's Munitions Investigation Committee, immediately publish the names of the Chinese officials and generals mentioned in the letter from the DuPont company's representative in China who allegedly received commissions. If this is indeed the case, a thorough investigation will be conducted. As for Chairman Nye's claim that China used $20 million in American cotton and wheat loans to exchange for arms from Italy, this is completely untrue. The cotton, wheat, and flour that China borrowed from the United States were successively shipped to Shanghai and sold, and the resulting cash was entirely used by the National Economic Council for construction purposes. The facts are there and can be proven. To say that China purchased arms from Italy and then immediately claim that this was a misappropriation of American cotton and wheat loans is absurd. If you see me buying a penny's worth of peanuts, can you immediately say that this penny was stolen from the Central Bank? It is regrettable that such untrue statements came from the mouth of the chairman of the U.S. Senate's Munitions Investigation Committee.</p>
<h3 id="e121">We Should Know to Strengthen Ourselves from Failing to be Elected to the League of Nations <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>As for our country's failure to be re-elected as a non-permanent member of the League of Nations, I am deeply saddened. However, the people of our country should not be discouraged by this. We must work hard to strengthen ourselves, and then one day, even if our country does not compete, it will surely be elected. Do you not see the Soviet Union today? The Soviet Union is a socialist country that was once incompatible with the capitalist countries of Europe. Now, after years of struggle, the Soviet Union has reached a state of prosperity and strength, so European countries invited it to join the League of Nations and elected it as a permanent member. If the people of our country can strive to strengthen themselves, our international standing will naturally increase. Why would it be limited to just being elected as a non-permanent member of the League of Nations?</p>
<h3 id="e122">Old Revenue Stamps Will Never Be Exchanged <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>In the past, merchants would sometimes buy revenue stamps, fulfilling their tax obligations, but then store the stamps in boxes without affixing them. There were even cases of buying stamps today and reselling them to others tomorrow, or taking old stamps to places where stamps were affixed for sale. The Ministry of Finance, in order to prevent these abuses, in addition to printing regional designations on the stamps, has decided to abolish accumulated old stamps and declare them invalid starting from November 1st, and issue new tax stamps. This decision was made at the National Financial Conference convened in June. At that time, after the abolition of miscellaneous taxes, the local governments' finances were expected to experience panic, so the central government decided to allocate one-third of the original central revenue stamp tax revenue to subsidize local governments, one-tenth to subsidize provincial governments, and two-tenths to subsidize border provincial governments. The old stamps would be abolished, declared invalid, and new revenue stamps would be issued and strictly affixed. However, in order to alleviate the difficulties of merchants, the central government originally planned to implement this on September 1st, but because the new stamps have not yet been printed, the implementation has been postponed to November. Requests from local chambers of commerce to exchange accumulated old stamps for new stamps, extending the validity of old stamps until the end of this year, are unreasonable and will not be approved by the Ministry of Finance. In the future, the issuance of new stamps will be handled by post offices, and local governments will supervise merchants' affixation.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Prize Savings Will Be Immediately Banned <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the prohibition of prize savings, the Ministry of Finance is currently studying sound measures and will implement them as soon as a decision is made.</p>

<p>Director Zhao has now contacted the five banks to discuss the amount of the loan. The provincial government plans to borrow one million yuan, but the banks are willing to lend 200,000 to 300,000 yuan first, depending on the amount of grain purchased. The purchased grain will serve as collateral. However, it is stipulated that the provincial government will allocate funds to cover losses. The contract will be signed after negotiations are completed.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Commencement of Purchases <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>After the banks agreed to the grain storage loan, the provincial government, recognizing that new rice has already entered the market in rice-producing areas in northern Jiangsu, will allocate 50,000 yuan and send staff to purchase it. In the future, it will be sold at a fixed price to facilitate regulation. This loan for grain storage is of a pilot nature. If it proves successful in the future, the scope will be expanded.</p>

<h3 id="e133">Shanghai County Government Plans to Draft a Labor Conscription Dredging River Plan for the 23rd Year <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government previously received reports from various district offices stating that there are more than fifty rivers that need to be dredged this year. However, due to a lack of funding, implementation is difficult. Therefore, at the Third County Administrative Conference, it was proposed that two points be allocated from the original eight-point security tax per mu to be used as water conservancy funds. After repeated requests, it was approved yesterday to allocate 1.5 points as special funds for water conservancy. However, with many rivers and limited funds, progress is still difficult. At the second meeting of the Construction Committee the other day, the matter was raised for discussion. It was decided to allocate all the remaining funds from the construction fund to cover the costs of labor conscription for dredging rivers to facilitate implementation. The County Government has now drafted a plan for dredging rivers this year, and dredging can be gradually started and carried out in sequence thereafter. The plan is briefly described below:</p>
<h3 id="e134">Rivers to be Dredged <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>According to reports from various district offices, there are more than fifty rivers to be dredged this year, including the Yingbao River, with a total length of more than one hundred li. With the exception of the Yingbao River, for which a special report has been submitted and a temporary mu tax has been levied, and staff have been sent to survey it, the remaining rivers have a total length of about one hundred Chinese li. Although the width and length vary, the surveying, labor conscription, construction, and management are generally the same.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Construction Procedures <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>In accordance with Article 3 of the Revised Regulations for Labor Conscription for Dredging Rivers in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province, the matters of labor conscription for dredging rivers within this county should be proposed and supervised by the Construction Committee of this county. All surveying, design, and budgeting should be handled by the construction personnel in charge of this county. As for labor conscription and construction, for larger projects with a volume of more than 100,000 cubic meters, a Project Office for Labor Conscription and Dredging of a Certain River may be established, which will be under the command of the County Chief and the construction personnel in charge, and be responsible for handling the matter. For smaller projects, the County Chief and the construction personnel in charge will directly command the relevant District Chiefs to handle the matter. This County also sent staff last month to conduct surveys of the rivers to be dredged this year, which are expected to be completed by the end of October. Then, drawings and tables will be made, the amount of earth and water will be calculated, and a budget for the construction of dams and water drainage will be prepared and submitted to the Construction Department for review. In mid-November, when the busy farming season has passed and the river tides have receded, construction can be started uniformly in early December in accordance with the plans and drawings, recruiting workers to build dams, cut off the flow, and drain the accumulated water. As for the matter of labor conscription and task assignment, for larger projects with a River Construction Office, the office will be responsible for handling the matter. For those without an office, the respective District Offices will be responsible for handling the matter. All matters should be completed by the end of November to avoid delaying the deadline for construction.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Construction Deadline <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The rivers to be dredged this year will all commence construction in early December and be completed by the end of May next year, for a total of six months. Except in special circumstances, all projects must be completed within the time limit. The Provincial Government will first send staff to inspect and accept the projects separately, and then submit the cases to the Construction Department for review and acceptance.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Budget Estimate <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The expenses for labor conscription and river dredging, in accordance with Article 11 of the Revised Regulations for Labor Conscription for Dredging Rivers in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province, with the exception of the expenses for building dams and draining water, and the expenses for food rations in remote areas, which will be prepared according to the actual situation, all other expenses for surveying, equipment, and management should be limited to 20 to 50 yuan per kilometer. If a Project Office is established, the necessary expenses will be included. According to reports from various district offices, the rivers to be dredged in this county last year reached more than 100 Chinese li (approximately 60 kilometers). Calculating an average of 40 yuan per kilometer, the expenses for surveying, equipment, and management are estimated to be 2,400 yuan. Other expenses for building dams, draining water, and repairing bridges must be prepared after the survey is completed. It is currently estimated at 70 yuan per kilometer, totaling 4,200 yuan. The total expenses are 6,600 yuan. However, the water conservancy funds that can be levied in this county this year are only more than 3,000 yuan, and the remaining funds from the construction fund (excluding those with designated uses) are only more than 1,000 yuan. Even if all of them are allocated, they are only enough to dredge 40 kilometers of rivers. According to the regulations of Case No. 5 of the Revised Detailed Rules for the Implementation of Labor Conscription for Dredging Rivers in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province, the length of the rivers to be dredged and cleared annually in each county should be 20 to 50 kilometers. This county has a small area and a sparse population, and the rivers to be dredged this year, according to the reports from various district offices, reach more than 60 kilometers, which exceeds the maximum limit. Therefore, in order to take into account the actual situation, it is still necessary to reduce the amount to 40 kilometers.</p>

<h3 id="e139">Shanghai-Sichuan Exchange Rate Soars <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Reason: A Large Amount of Sichuan Silver Flows into Shanghai</p>
<p>Result: Suspension of Shanghai Goods Transportation to Sichuan</p>
<p>The exchange rate between Sichuan and Shanghai has soared. Every 1,000 Sichuan yuan is only worth 690 national currency yuan in Shanghai. Compared to the original exchange rate, Shanghai yuan has risen by about 200 yuan per 1,000 yuan. It is said that the reason is that in the past few weeks, 20 million yuan has been remitted to Shanghai from Chongqing, Wanxian, and other places. Until recently, huge sums of money have continued to be remitted, and banks have had to increase the exchange rate.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Restrictions on Further Increase <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The Qingyou Securities Exchange, which specializes in buying and selling "Shen" shares, has been its main business. Because the Shanghai-Sichuan exchange rate has risen to 1,370 yuan to purchase 1,000 Shanghai yuan, the exchange is unable to open and has suspended trading in "Shen" shares. Yesterday, according to Chongqing telegrams received by the Sichuan community in this port, the Sichuan Provincial Government, in view of the soaring exchange rate affecting commerce and the market, has ordered that the Sichuan exchange rate must not exceed 1,310 yuan, or penalties will be imposed.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Suspension of Goods Transportation <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Affected by the soaring exchange rate, the Sichuan community has found that purchasing and transporting goods to Sichuan has invisibly increased costs by 30%. It is also difficult to sell the goods after they arrive in Sichuan. Therefore, except for a small amount of essential goods being transported to Sichuan, the rest of the goods have been suspended. As a result, the volume of upstream cargo at the Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Minsheng, Jiejang, Sanbei, and other Sichuan River export ports has plummeted, accounting for only 20-30% compared to normal times. Fortunately, downstream cargo is still improving, which can slightly compensate for the losses.</p>

<p>Plans to Meet with Banking Circles in Our Country</p>
<p>Will Go to Beijing, Tianjin, and Other Places for Inspection</p>
<p>According to Datong News Agency in this port, Kato, the president of the Bank of Korea, has been very active in this city since arriving from Japan. Although the Japanese Embassy denies this, the banking circles in this city unanimously believe that Kato's visit has a major mission. In order to develop the Chinese market, Japan has repeatedly considered trying investment matters. If Kato observes that the public sentiment in our country is trending towards reconciliation with Japan, then this cause can be promoted under a certain pretext. Kato has repeatedly planned to meet with important figures in our banking circles in the past three days, but has not yet been able to get their agreement. As for Kato's itinerary, he will go to Beijing, Tianjin, and other places for inspection next week, and then return to Japan.</p>

<p>Designated Commissioners Assigned to Conduct District Surveys</p>
<p>Completion Required by the End of October</p>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, the Special Municipal Party Headquarters of this city previously received an order from the Central Government stating that the organization of people's organizations in various places is quite complex and imperfect. In order to provide a basis for guidance by the Party Headquarters in various places, it also issued detailed inspection reports on the general inspection methods for people's organizations nationwide. After receiving the order, the Municipal Party Headquarters originally planned to implement the inspection starting on July 1st, but it was not implemented because the re-election of various people's organizations had not yet been completed. It is now learned that the Municipal Party Headquarters has already classified and compiled the survey forms for various organizations. In order to understand the actual situation, it has been decided to send personnel to various districts to conduct a general inspection starting today (September 21st), which must be completed by the end of October. The list of inspection commissioners in charge of each district is recorded below: District 1 (Nanshi): Chen Jinfa, Xie Guichen, Li Qingxiang; District 2 (French Concession): Zhang Jianming; District 3 (British Concession): Yu Yaoqiu, Yang Dean, Cai Xiaohe; District 4 (Hongkou District): Zuo Guqing, Wang Fangli; District 5 (Pudong): Yan Zhaoji; District 6 (Zhabei): Li Pingxiang; Districts 7 and 8 (Jiangwan Wusong): Xia Weiqing; Districts 9 and 10 (Beixinjing Pusong): Ni Chunsheng.

<h3 id="e145">Shanghai Cholera Prevention Report <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>749,625 People Injected in This City</p>
<p>The Shanghai Cholera Prevention Temporary Office issued its third announcement yesterday. The contents include: (1) The general situation of the epidemic this year, (2) The research results of Vibrio cholerae, (3) The future work outline, (4) Statistics of the number of people injected in this city this year, etc., all of which are very important. The announcement is recorded below: (1) In Shanghai, since the discovery of the third case of cholera on August 28, no further cases have been found so far. The same is true for other ports. However, suspected cases have been found in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and Qingdao. In short, cholera can be said to be almost non-existent in the whole of China this year. Before the summer, the Meteorological Research Group of this office predicted that there would be no cholera epidemic this year. Now, this prediction has been proven by facts. (2) Other common gastrointestinal diseases, with dysentery being the most common, but not more than in previous years. Since July, the number of patients received by the epidemic hospitals has gradually decreased, and has decreased even more significantly since the beginning of September. In addition to those suffering from dysentery, most of the patients who seek medical treatment suffer from typhoid fever, gastroenteritis, malaria, seasonal epidemics, and heatstroke. (3) In this city, since the small typhoon on August 8, the rainfall was 0.36 inches, and the weather changed slightly. Since September, there have been more cloudy and rainy days. The record on September 15 was significant. The temperature was 79.3, the relative humidity was 99, and the rainfall was 2.37 inches. Most of the low-lying areas in this city were almost swamps. (4) The research on aquatic vibrios (non-pathogenic) in ponds, lakes and rivers is still continuing. The results obtained are quite interesting. For example, the first type of organism is very rare in winter, and gradually increases from May to June and July, reaching its peak. The second type is not the same, it proliferates very much in July, and its proliferation extends directly to the end of December. During the cholera season, there are many first-class solitary bacteria (the blood reaction is the same as that of the positive cholera solitary bacteria). In the Huangpu River, various vibrios have been found to have a slight agglutination reaction with the Hangzhou cholera serum. The reaction caused by the bacteria obtained in July is relatively strong. (5) On September 14, this office held a meeting and decided to merge the Epidemiology Group and the Propaganda Group to take charge of the following matters: (1) Water testing, (2) Inspection (3) Climate research, (4) Diagnosis and treatment research, (5) Injection, (6) Serum research, (7) Bacteriophage research, (8) Statistics, (5) Publicity, and decided to apply for 1,600 yuan from Jing Bao Yang to implement the following two tasks: (A) Strive to implement injections for those who are most susceptible to infection, (B) Expand publicity work, (C) Send experts to Ningbo (one of the sources of cholera) and other neighboring areas to study the water samples. (6) In August and September, injections continued to be administered. The number of injections in August is listed below: 124,272 in Shanghai City, 58,669 in the Public Concession, 15,011 in the French Concession, 56 in the Lianglu Bureau, totaling 198,008 people. Adding the previous number of injections of 551,617 people, the total number of legal injections by the end of August was 749,625 people. (7) If there are no special circumstances this season, it is feared that cholera will no longer occur, and no more announcements will be issued this year. (8) The Ninth Conference of the Southeast Asian Tropical Medical Association held in Nanjing will hold a cholera roundtable meeting on October 6 to discuss the following important issues: the relationship between Vibrio cholerae and similar vibrios, with special attention to the comparison of their antibody elements, the reaction of bacteriophages, and the chemical organization, and the evidence of the existence of Vibrio cholerae serum races, and the relationship with the preparation of diagnostic serum. In addition to discussing prevention methods and new methods for bacteriophage diagnosis and treatment, the relationship between patients and carriers, the impact of weather and the seasonality of cholera will also be discussed. The results obtained will be published together with other documents from the conference.</p>
<h3 id="e146">The Municipal Government Plans to Formulate Measures to Promote Domestic Chinese Fir Wood <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Two Standards Set at 30%</p>
<p>The Construction Industry Should Comply as a Whole</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously reported to the Municipal Government twice that the sales of domestic Chinese fir wood were completely encroached upon by foreign pine wood, requesting that the construction must select domestic Chinese fir wood to a certain percentage before a license can be issued, in order to maintain domestic production. Now it is learned that the Chamber of Commerce received a reply from the Municipal Government yesterday, and two measures for referring to domestic Chinese fir wood have been drafted, and will be implemented from January 1 next year. The original text reads: "Both reports are fully understood. The two ministries of Internal Affairs and Industry have successively sent documents to the government for this case, and the Bureau of Public Works has been ordered to review and discuss the case separately. Now, according to the Bureau's reply, the Bureau has formulated two minimum standards for referring to domestic Chinese fir wood in light of the construction situation in this city: (1) The columns of bungalows shall be made of domestic Chinese fir wood, (2) The purlins of bungalows with spans not exceeding 3.5 meters or building roofs shall be made of domestic Chinese fir wood, but their minimum diameter shall not be less than 12 cm. If you approve of the implementation, please set the implementation date by your government, announce it to the public, and inform the Ministry of Industry for filing. At the same time, the Bureau will notify the technicians, technicians and deputy technicians, and construction companies that are engaged in business in this city to comply as a whole, otherwise the license will not be approved in order to maintain domestic production. Whether it is appropriate or not, it is appropriate to submit a document for review and follow, which is convenient for the public." Based on this, the two standards proposed in the review are feasible and should be approved. The implementation will be set from January 1, 24th year of the Republic. In addition to ordering the Bureau to forward the order for compliance and informing the two ministries of Internal Affairs and Industry, it is appropriate to issue instructions for notification, this approval.</p>

<p>Some Corrections to the Statement of the Real Estate Association</p>
<p>(5) In Germany under Hitler, (Interest Slavery) must be overthrown as soon as possible, which is highly praised. In economic history, there are many examples of prohibiting interest and restricting interest. We are not fond of high-level discussions, nor do we want to understand each other. However, looking around the world's major cities, the interest rates are as high as those mentioned by the Real Estate Association (8.5% for foreign merchants and 10% for Chinese merchants). Please refer to the following table.</p>
<p>Official Interest Rate Table of Major Countries in the World (Battle Position%)</p>

<p>The table on the right shows the official interest rates of major countries in the world from 1913 to the end of February last year. The highest among them was 9.15% in Germany in 1925, when the country was in the midst of financial turmoil. The lowest was 2% in the United Kingdom in 1933. However, the actual interest rate of banks in the market was far lower than the official limit. For example, the average interest rate on the market in Germany in 1925 was only 7.62%, while the interest rate in London in 1933 was as low as 0.87%, and the interest rate in New York was even lower at 0.32%. From 1931 to 1933, the interest rate in Paris did not exceed 1.8%. Therefore, in terms of the world's financial situation, real estate and financial industries should not operate at high interest rates that are unparalleled in the world for housing that everyone needs. This should be noted. Furthermore, in terms of the interest rates of domestic industries, the maximum interest rate for farmers to purchase production materials cannot exceed 5%. This is something that everyone who is close to the countryside knows. Even in this city, households that save money and earn interest are satisfied with an annual interest rate of 5-6% if they encounter a reliable opportunity. For example, the interest rates of the Public Works Bureau's public bonds, telephone company shares, electric power company shares, and corporate bonds do not exceed 6%, and those who purchase them are amazed. This proves that investment households do not attempt to obtain excessive interest. Why does the Real Estate Association alone impose an interest rate of 8.5% or even 10% on tenants? This should be reviewed in terms of the domestic financial situation. Housing that everyone needs should not be charged a high interest rate that is not needed in the market.</p>

He was taken to the district for interrogation. According to his confession, his name is Song Jisheng, 25 years old, from Shaoxing. He was originally a police officer in his hometown. Now, because the authorities checked his physical condition and limited the height to more than 5 feet 2 inches, he was allowed to keep his job. Because I was not tall enough, I lost my job and came to Shanghai to find a friend to seek a job, but I failed. The fellow villagers association gave me a boat ticket.

<p>Lan Fuming, a student of Jinan University in Zhenru, from Guangdong, was learning to drive a car with many classmates near the Jiaotong Road beside the school at about 10 am yesterday. Although he had a little knowledge of the basics, his skills were not very good. Therefore, he was slanting from east to west along the way, and the direction was uncertain. At the same time, the speed was also suddenly slow and suddenly fast, and there was no way to grasp it. In the blink of an eye, Lan suddenly saw three female classmates walking leisurely in front of the car, and they were about to be hit. He panicked and was about to brake, but he lost his footing, causing the car to knock down all three female students who were walking in front, Hua Shuxian, Wu Yongmei, and Ouyang Shu.

<h3 id="e165">Carpenter, Angered by Wife's Flight, Stabs Neighbor Woman, Auntie Lu, to Death <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Huang Xiuying's Dislike of Her Ugly Husband Was the Real Culprit</p>
<p>Auntie Lu's Major Intervention Leads to a Wrongful Death</p>
<p>丨The Culprit Fled After Committing the Crime and Remains at Large丨</p>
<p>Zhang Gengtao, also known as A'gen, a local carpenter, thirty-seven years old, through the matchmaking of his friend Tao Boliang, engaged Huang Xiuying (seventeen years old this year), the daughter of Huang Yinquan, a local resident of No. 139, Xiao Jiu Hua Street, outside Xiaonanmen in the southern part of the city, as his wife on the fourth day of the tenth month of the lunar calendar. He married her on the fifth day of the second month of the lunar calendar this year. After marriage, they lived together in a small room at No. 374, Block C, Rue Massenet in the French Concession. Zhang went out to work every day, leaving early and returning late, leaving Xiuying alone at home. With nothing to do in her spare time, Xiuying often went to the home of Lu Guanglin (thirty-two years old, a Ningbo native, working as a coppersmith at the Southeast Steel Factory at Xinqiao Intersection on Xietu Road), at No. 374, Block D, next door, to play. She became close friends with Lu's wife, Zhang, nineteen years old this year, who was known as Auntie Lu. After Huang Xiuying's marriage, the couple's relationship was quite affectionate, but over time, feeling that her husband was old and ugly, she felt like a bright phoenix unwilling to follow a crow. On the twenty-third day of the sixth month of the lunar calendar, she secretly ran away from her husband without a trace, secretly writing a letter to her parents, Huang Yinquan and Huang Dai, stating that she did not want to live with Zhang and asking her parents to compensate Zhang for his losses so he could marry someone else. She also said that if they wanted to know her whereabouts, they could ask Auntie Lu next door. After receiving the letter, the Huang couple went to Auntie Lu's place with Zhang to inquire. Lu Zhang said she knew nothing about Zhang's wife's escape and answered truthfully, but Zhang was not convinced. He used the letter as evidence and reported to the French police, accusing Auntie Lu of hiding his wife. The police sent detectives to investigate, but found no evidence and did not prosecute, only ordering Auntie Lu to help find her, with a deadline of three days. After the deadline, Zhang hired a lawyer to file a criminal complaint in the Special District Court, accusing Auntie Lu of disrupting the family and requesting an investigation, as well as filing a civil suit, requesting the return of his wife. Judge Li Changnian opened a court hearing on the ninth of this month to investigate the situation, which was recorded in the newspapers on the tenth. Subsequently, the court ruled that there was no evidence and declared Auntie Lu not guilty on the twelfth. At this point, Auntie Lu and her husband, Lu Guanglin, felt aggrieved by the groundless accusation in court, which damaged their reputation. They arranged to meet Zhang at the Quan'an Teahouse at the southern end of the Ba Xian Qiao Small Vegetable Market on the fourteenth to discuss compensation for the damage to their reputation. Unexpectedly, Zhang failed to appear on time, causing Auntie Lu and the people she had invited to the scene to leave disappointed. From then on, Zhang was not seen returning home. For many days, until yesterday morning, Auntie Lu learned that Zhang Gengtao was at home and went alone to Zhang Gengtao's place at nine o'clock to question him about why he had failed to appear at the teahouse on the fourteenth and to demand compensation for her reputation. The two began to argue. Zhang, feeling that his wife had been enticed to run away, and despite having his wife's letter as proof, his accusation had failed and he was now being constantly harassed, in a moment of anger, took a sharp knife and stabbed Auntie Lu three times in the right breast, chest, abdomen, navel, and left side. Lu fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. Zhang abandoned the murder weapon and fled. Lu cried out for help. The second landlord downstairs heard the commotion and went upstairs to check, finding Auntie Lu rolling in a pool of blood, blood gushing from her wounds. He was greatly shocked, and Zhang Gengtao had already fled. He reported to the French police, who sent the injured person to Guangci Hospital. Due to the severity of the injuries, the treatment was ineffective, and she died at 12:15 pm. The hospital notified the police, who sent detectives to carry the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Mortuary for an autopsy, pending a report to the Special District Court today to send someone to examine the body. The police ordered all detectives to strictly arrest the fleeing suspect and bring him to justice for questioning.</p>

<p>According to yesterday's Japanese-language "Mainichi Shimbun," a Japanese trader, Mr. Kakuzaburo Matsudaira, upon returning from Australia and passing through Shanghai, was suddenly seduced by a mysterious Philippine woman, who stole a large sum of money and turned him into an invalid overnight. This was reported in a previous issue. Currently, Matsumoto is still unconscious at Osaka University Hospital, and it is difficult to diagnose his illness. The Foreign Affairs Section of the Osaka Prefectural Police Department and the Fukushima Police Station, which has jurisdiction over Osaka University Hospital, are conducting a thorough investigation of the Tanda-go, the ship that Matsumoto took when returning to Japan, as well as its passengers and other details. Meanwhile, the Japanese Consulate and Police Department in Shanghai have also begun an investigation, centered on the international city of Shanghai, to clarify the truth of the incident and track down the mysterious beauty. According to reports, this demon is named Gomeidu. She is twenty-one years old, petite, and speaks three languages. She claims to be a graduate of the Law School of the University of Chicago.

<p>Accomplice's Show of Force Accidentally Wounds His Partner</p>
<p>Sent to Hospital for Treatment, He Dies of His Injuries</p>
<p>At approximately 7:40 p.m. last night, two robbers suddenly went to the Futai Chang Candle Shop at No. 1107, Xiaoshadu Road, to commit robbery. One robber was empty-handed, and the other was armed with a gun. They broke into the shop at the same time. The armed robber first forced the shop assistants to hand over the key to the safe, then gave it to the empty-handed robber. The robber opened the safe and filled his bag with banknotes and silver dollars. At that moment, one of the shop assistants took advantage of the robbers' inattention and ran upstairs, shouting "Catch the robbers!" to the street. The robbers downstairs panicked. The armed robber turned around and fired a shot into the shop in an attempt to intimidate. Unexpectedly, the empty-handed robber had not yet run out of the shop, and the bullet struck him in the eye and exited the back of his head. He fell to the ground. Fortunately, the police from the Putuo Road Police Station had already arrived at the scene after hearing the alarm. They arrested the injured robber, found the stolen goods, and took him to the police station before transferring him to the Public Works Department Hospital for treatment. However, due to the severity of his injuries, he soon died. His body was sent to the mortuary for examination. The police are searching for the accomplice who escaped.</p>

<p>Police Lawyer Sues Wu Xihou</p>
<p>Accused of Trying to Kill His Uncle but Accidentally Killing His Wife</p>
<p>Wu Xihou (also known as Wu Zhangsheng), a local resident of No. 36, Maqi Road (i.e., Yida Jiao) in western Shanghai, is forty-one years old. He used to work for the British-American Tobacco Company but resigned in recent years and became a land broker, which provides him with a comfortable life. His family inherited a lot of property, and several acres of land near his residence are still co-owned with his uncle Wu Gengsheng and cousins Gengfu, Yinggui, Fusheng, and Alin. Recently, Gengsheng and others repeatedly proposed surveying the land, but Xihou opposed it each time. At 10:30 a.m. the day before yesterday, Gengsheng and others invited a surveyor from the Land Bureau, as well as the land guarantor Wang Zhenxiang and his assistant Jin Xiangsheng, to jointly survey the land. Xihou still firmly obstructed them, leading to arguments and then a major conflict between uncles and cousins. Xihou was outnumbered and suffered injuries to his head and arms. He fled home with his injuries, and Gengsheng and others followed him into his house, acting aggressively. Xihou took out a pistol for self-defense and fired into the air, hoping to scare Gengsheng and others away. At that moment, Xihou's wife, Wu Wang, fearing disaster, stepped forward to dissuade him. During the commotion, another shot was fired, hitting her in the chest. She immediately fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. The police officer from a nearby station heard the alarm and rushed to his house to investigate the cause of the incident and examine the injured woman, who had already died. The police officer reported this to the Gordon Road Police Station, which sent Deputy Inspector Moore, Officer Liu Chun, and Officer Pi Shengchang to arrest Wu Xihou and Wu Gengsheng, Gengfu, Yinggui, Fusheng, Alin, and witness Jin Xiangsheng, who had participated in the dispute. After questioning them, they detained Xihou and released the others. The body of Wu Wang was taken by the detectives to the mortuary on Filon Road. Yesterday morning, the police filed a public lawsuit against Wu Xihou, stating that he had used his self-defense pistol to shoot at his uncle Wu Gengsheng, but Gengsheng had hid behind Wu Wang, causing her to be accidentally shot and killed. Judge Yan Liangce of the First Special District Court opened a court hearing to summon the murderer and key witnesses, including Wu Gengsheng, to the court for questioning. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the case and requested a postponement of the trial as the body still needed to be examined. Judge Yan questioned each witness and the defendant about the incident and then adjourned the trial to a later date. The Chinese and Western detectives in charge of the case escorted the defendant to the mortuary. Soon after, Prosecutor Tang, along with forensic doctors and court clerks, arrived at the mortuary to examine the body. They confirmed that the bullet had entered from the front of the chest but had not exited. The bullet was still inside the deceased's abdomen. Then, they began the interrogation, with the detectives first reporting the incident and the results of the investigation. Next, the defendant Wu Xihou testified that he had fired into the air to scare Gengsheng and others away, but they had not retreated, and Alin had hugged his waist tightly while Fusheng had firmly gripped the hand holding the gun, causing the gun to fire accidentally and injure his wife. However, since she had died tragically, he asked to be exempted from the autopsy and requested permission to view the remains in the morgue. Prosecutor Tang then ordered the victim's aunt, Wu Sheng, to sign a statement to claim the body for burial. As for Wu Xihou's criminal liability, the police have filed a public lawsuit and he should be detained for questioning.</p>

<p>Resentment of Ren Protecting the Servant</p>
<p>Angered, She Commits Suicide by Hanging</p>
<p>Ren Zhaoshi, a native of Henan, thirty-eight years old, previously held important military and political positions in Guangdong and other places. Later, he came to Shanghai and became a real estate businessman. After several years of operation, he accumulated considerable wealth. He currently lives at No. 5, Lane 516, Yuyuan Road in western Shanghai. He has a wife and a concubine living together in peace. He owns a private car and employs several male and female servants. His concubine, Gan Yulan, twenty-nine years old, is a Cantonese woman with beautiful features and is favored by Ren. She is also in charge of most of the household affairs. Unexpectedly, at around 10 a.m. on the seventeenth of this month, Ren planned to go out on business and ordered the male servant Zhu Youshan (also from Henan) to call his private car. However, the garage was several dozen paces away from Ren's house. At that time, it was raining heavily, so Zhu asked the maid to borrow an umbrella from Ren's concubine to protect himself from the rain. Unexpectedly, she refused. Zhu had to go in the rain, and he felt resentful. He muttered to himself in the kitchen. Ren's concubine happened to be there and heard him, thinking that Zhu was insulting her. She began to scold him loudly. Since the two were not from the same hometown, their language was confusing. Ren's concubine went upstairs to complain to her husband. Ren, who was in the bathroom at the time, heard both sides. Since Zhu had not said anything malicious, Ren did not blame Zhu after hearing his concubine's complaint. Instead, he rationally explained the situation to her and scolded her for not giving him the umbrella. At this point, the concubine became even more resentful because her husband was protecting a servant. She returned to her bedroom and cried all day, refusing to eat or drink. Ren and others thought that her behavior was common and did not think much of it. Unexpectedly, the next day, she suddenly had a suicidal thought and hanged herself in the bedroom when no one was watching. When she was discovered, her face was pale and she could not speak. The Jing'an Temple Police Station was notified and sent detectives to investigate. They sent her to the hospital, but the treatment was ineffective, and she soon died. The detectives then carried the body to the mortuary on Filon Road. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Tang, along with forensic doctors Wei and Zhang, and court clerk Wang Zuyi, were dispatched by the First Special District Court to the mortuary to confirm the identity of the body. They questioned Ren Zhaoshi, Zhu Youshan, and others about the incident. Tang then ordered that the deceased, Gan Yulan, a female, had indeed died by hanging herself before death. The body was handed over to the deceased's family member, Ren Zhaoshi, who signed a statement to claim it for burial.</p>

<p>Forensic Doctor Confirms No Injuries</p>
<p>Two Inmates Refuse to Return to Jail</p>
<p>Zhang Weicai, Zhao Yunzu, Liu Agui, and three other inmates in the Second Special District Prison on Rue Massenet in the French Concession attempted to escape on the morning of the ninth of this month at 3 a.m. Liu fell and died during the attempt. The prison transferred Zhang and Zhao to the Special District Court Procuratorate, where Prosecutor Wang Ren opened a court hearing to investigate. According to the two inmates, they were beaten and injured by the prison director and others and requested an investigation. This was reported in a previous issue. At 11 a.m. yesterday, Prosecutor Wang specially opened the Second Criminal Court and ordered inmates Zhang and Zhao, as well as Director Wang Baochang, Doctor Hu Qipeng, and guards Nie Zhenchun and Fu Maoshun, to appear in court to continue the investigation into the alleged beating. First, the two inmates testified about how they were beaten and injured. Then, Director Wang Baochang was questioned and denied the assault, stating that he was not on duty at 6 a.m. and could not have beaten them. Doctor Hu Qipeng stated that he had treated Liu Agui after his fall. At first, he was still conscious, but he was injured in the back of the head. He said that if there was no change in forty-eight hours, there would be no problem. Later, on the second day, his condition worsened, he became unconscious, and he lost control of his bowels and bladder. He reported this to the warden, who sent him to the hospital. The official then questioned guards Nie and Chuan. The official said to inmate Zhang, "The forensic doctor has confirmed that there are no injuries on your body. What else do you have to say?" Zhang replied, "Whether I have injuries or not is not the point. Liu Agui was seriously injured at the time, and the doctor should have reported that he was injured and could not be subjected to torture. He was locked in a dark room for two days and should have been treated after his injuries healed before being dealt with." At this point, the official ordered the two inmates to be sent back to prison to await trial, and the others were dismissed. The two inmates refused to return to prison, wishing to be sent to another prison. They were eventually taken away by the bailiffs and sent back to prison.</p>

<p>Request for a One-Time Payment of $30,000</p>
<p>Interest to Be Used for Living Expenses</p>
<p>Zhou Wende, a native of Ningbo, runs the Deda Mat Shop at No. 380, Fujian Road, and also engages in leasing business, establishing the Hua'an Company to manage rental accounts. Because Zhou's business is successful, he has accumulated assets of one to two hundred thousand yuan. Zhou originally married a Miss Zhu as his concubine, and they have a son. Because Miss Zhu is very strict and her orders are absolute, Zhou fears her like a tiger and his actions are monitored. They live together at No. 5, Fuhua Lane, Dongyouheng Road. Last year, Zhou suddenly decided to marry another wife. Through the matchmaking of relatives and friends, he married Miss Lin (currently thirty-two years old), a woman from his hometown, in February last year. They rented a house at No. 399, Yongxiang Dongli, Yuanfang Road. But since the marriage, Miss Lin has noticed that Zhou's actions are unusually secretive, and she became careful and investigated. She found out that he already had a concubine, so she expressed her feelings to Zhou. Since then, Zhou's visits gradually became infrequent, and daily living expenses were often cut off. Lin had no choice but to borrow money to make ends meet. However, after a long time, she felt the hardship of having no way to borrow money, so she hired a lawyer to send a letter demanding living expenses, but to no avail. She hired lawyers Yuan Hanyun and Hu Jue to sue him in the First Special District Court, requesting a court order for cohabitation and demanding a one-time payment of $20,000 for alimony. This amount would be deposited in a bank with a monthly interest rate of 5%, yielding an interest of $100, which would be used as living expenses. The court approved the petition.</p>
<p>The defendant failed to appear after being summoned. Lawyers Hu and Yuan presented Zhou Lin's marriage certificate to the court. The court stated that it could not proceed because the defendant had not arrived and adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>

<p>Arrested at the Dafang Hotel</p>
<p>Police Have Filed a Lawsuit</p>
<p>Fang Baoqing, a local gangster residing at No. 5, Baoyu Lane, Caishi Street, in the French Concession (twenty-two years old, from Ningbo, a disciple of the notorious gangster Baiyan A'di), was sitting outside the lane entrance of Taiyuanfang, Xizilaihuo Street, Caishi Street, at 4 a.m. on July 5th of this year, when it was already broad daylight, instead of being home asleep. Mao Afu (twenty years old, from Dinghai, residing at No. 134, Dongxinqiao Street, the son of Hongwan King Mao Wenlong, and a disciple of gangster Yuan Jinxiang), whom he knew, approached Fang and said, "It's such a nice cool weather, Boss, why aren't you going back to sleep? You're in such good health." Fang was enraged by these words, thinking that Mao was trying to undermine his reputation. He replied, "Are you here to pick on me?" This is a gangster term. As the two were talking, someone suddenly approached Fang from behind with a broad axe and slashed Fang's left shoulder. Then, he turned around and ran away. About twenty-five shop fronts away, a gunshot was heard. The bullet grazed Fang's right leg, causing him to be injured as well. Upon examination, Fang realized that the gun was fired by Mao Afu's old man, Yuan Jinxiang. He reported this to the French police, who arrested the perpetrators Li Decai and Shen Yongxing and sent them to the Special District Court for questioning. Li was sentenced to four years in prison, and Shen was sentenced to two years in prison. However, Mao Afu and Yuan Jinxiang were at large. On the day before yesterday, the French police, led by Deputy Inspector Ge Laixi, detectives Jin Jiulin, Jiang Changwen, Yang Yilong, and Bao Tan Dai Rongji, raided a red pill sales operation at No. 428, Dafang Hotel, Zhengjia Muqiao, and arrested Cai Yongquan, a young man from Shandong, and seized red pills. The investigation and detention were reported in yesterday's newspaper. To arrest accomplices, the police sent detectives to guard the organization. They successively arrested Mao Afu, Li Fusheng, and Wu Linmei, who were related to the previous case, and took them to the police station. Yesterday afternoon, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District on charges of attempted murder. Police lawyer Yuan Jiahuang explained the case and requested a postponement of the investigation. Judge Li Changnian approved the request after questioning the defendants and adjourned the hearing to the 25th to investigate further. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Two Railway Bureaus Independently Trial-Produce Two Kinds of Consumables <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Locomotive Oil... Could Save $38,000 Per Year</p>
<p>Storage Batteries... Could Save $25,000 Per Year</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the two railways use over 70,000 gallons of locomotive oil per year. In 1932, Asiatic Petroleum Company (Shell) A-grade oil was purchased, which was considered the most suitable, but its price of $1.80 per gallon was uneconomical (this year's asking price has dropped to $1.35). Last year, Mobil M-brand pure mineral oil was purchased at $1.18 per gallon. Although the price was cheaper, its quality was not suitable. Only after blending in vegetable oil could it be used with difficulty. This year, the locomotive oil ordered by the railway is sold by Shengyuan Company, totaling 77,000 gallons at $0.88 per gallon, but this oil cannot be used directly in the summer. The Chemical Testing Institute, at the Wusong Materials Factory, opened a room, hired workers, and blended it with axle oil, using summer axle oil for summer use and adding a small amount of vegetable oil. The result was quite good, and the users were satisfied. After winter, they will switch to blending it with winter axle oil and still add a small amount of vegetable oil. The price of axle oil is $0.66 per gallon, so the average price of locomotive oil after blending is $0.77 per gallon, which is $0.11 less than the original price of the unsuitable Shengyuan oil. Considering the full 77,000 gallons, a total of $8,470 can be saved. Compared with last year's Mobil M-brand oil, which cost $1.28 per gallon after blending in vegetable oil, about $0.50 per gallon can be saved, for a total savings of over $38,000. In addition, for the Shanghai-Nanjing line, the passenger car storage batteries require an average of 18 to 20 new batteries per year (each car has two sets, each set containing twelve batteries). The storage batteries for long-distance telephones are not included in this figure, so the number is quite large. In the past, these were purchased from foreign countries, which was very expensive. The Shanghai Power Plant of the railway has started to manufacture its own batteries using existing equipment and labor. It has already made enough storage batteries for four cars and is currently designing new models to improve the products. The wooden boxes for the storage batteries were also ordered from foreign countries in the past. In fact, the manufacturing process is very simple, so the factory has also decided to manufacture them themselves and has started work. According to the current market price, one set of 17-brand storage batteries (consisting of 24 batteries, enough for one car) costs $1,800. The material cost of manufacturing two sets themselves is about $500. Considering the total of 36 to 40 sets per year, approximately $25,000 can be saved.</p>
<h3 id="e174">The Tobacco and Exchange Guild Writes to the Chamber of Commerce to Ask the Authorities for Compassion Regarding the License Tax <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>The Tobacco and Exchange Guild of this city has repeatedly received reports from its members that the Finance Bureau's Municipal South Collection Office has ordered the police to urge members to obtain tobacco and alcohol licenses and to pay the back taxes for the change in grade. Since the review on the city's side has not been completed, the urging to obtain licenses is considered inappropriate, and the guild has requested that the City Chamber of Commerce forward a request to the authorities for compassion. Based on this, the guild sent another letter to the City Chamber of Commerce yesterday, which reads: "Dear Sirs, upon investigation, we received a letter dated the 14th of this month, which states (omitted) that the City Finance Bureau's letter regarding the East District's members' request to reduce the tobacco and alcohol license tax has been approved, and the names of the households listed in the Pudong roster have not been raised in grade, and the licenses have been filled out and are awaiting collection. We are now returning the original receipts with a letter attached, asking each shop to collect them from that office. In addition, on the 18th, we received a letter from your esteemed association stating that Yonghe and Rongxing Hongji in Xujiahui in the West District are considered to have very prosperous cigarette businesses, and ordering them to obtain retail licenses of both grades is very fair. After investigation, the business of these shops is equivalent to that of the households in Pudong, and it is still appropriate to exchange the original licenses according to the original licenses. Those who have requested exemption from the increase are only two households, and they should be allowed to fill out licenses of the same grade to show tolerance and avoid disputes. We have now received reports from members in the South District, such as Yu Tai Xiehe Feng and other shops, that the Municipal South Collection Office has sent the police to the shops, forcing them to go to the bureau. Our shops did not dare to disobey and immediately sent clerks to the collection office with the police. They said, 'Why haven't you paid for the licenses? You must come to collect the licenses within one week, or you will be sent to the Public Security Bureau for punishment.' After investigation, our shops have all applied for tax payment and registration in accordance with the regulations. However, the receipts from our shops have been sent to your esteemed association, requesting that the City Chamber of Commerce forward a request to the Finance Bureau to exempt them from the increase. The South District has not yet received a reply from the bureau, and the office has suddenly sent the police to collect the taxes, which seems inappropriate because merchants are not given consideration. We respectfully request that the City Chamber of Commerce make a statement and request the authorities to consider the merchants' difficulties and not send the police to collect the taxes. After the City Chamber of Commerce forwards the letter to our guild, it will be convenient to collect the licenses uniformly. This would be a great favor to us. Upon investigation, the above-mentioned matters are true. We are writing to inform you of the situation and request that your esteemed association approve our request and quickly forward it to the Finance Bureau for special consideration."</p>

<h3 id="e175">The Most Complete Chinese-Run Livestock and Dairy Company <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Substantial Capital...Comprehensive Facilities</p>
<p>Scientific and Hygienic...Good Quality and Low Price</p>
<p>The Shanghai Livestock and Dairy Company, managed by Mr. Ma Ying-piu, the general supervisor of Sincere Company, has been in operation for over a decade and has achieved remarkable results. The company advocates that to regain concessions, it is necessary to first gain the trust of the Chinese people. Therefore, it has invested hundreds of thousands of dollars to establish the most modern and complete cow sheds in Jiangwan and Wusong, paying close attention to the health of the cattle. It has long been granted an "A" grade license by the Shanghai Municipal Council. According to the latest inspection results, none of the cows at the company's Wusong branch farm have tuberculosis, setting a new record in this city. Recently, they hired the renowned Canadian veterinarian Mr. Phillips as the director of the production department, personally supervising the cattle and all aspects of hygiene. The milk produced is disinfected using the latest Pasteurizing machines. Milk processed by this machine can be drunk cold without the need for further boiling, which reduces nutritional content.</p>
<p>To gain the trust of the Chinese people, in addition to focusing on hygiene, the quality of the milk is also carefully considered. Most of the company's cows are purchased from the United States, and a large portion are Guernsey breeds. Therefore, the company's milk is particularly rich, with an average butterfat content of 4.6%, which is 31% higher than the health bureau's standard. The local Chinese population quickly recognized the company's reliability, and the number of customers has increased to over 3,000 households, demonstrating the high regard it enjoys in the community.</p>
<p>In recent years, business has been exceptionally prosperous. Last year, a pasture was added in Wusong, covering more than 600 acres, and 100 dairy cows were purchased. Recently, another 65 cows have been added and are being transported in succession. Some of these cows are worth as much as three to four thousand dollars each. There are also plans to expand the land by 2,000 acres for livestock and planting. Based on the quality of the milk produced by the company, the selling price should be higher than others. However, due to mass production to reduce costs, it is actually cheaper than other companies.</p>
<p>Recently, a new preferential program for long-term customers has been introduced. Customers only need to pay a small deposit of 20 yuan to enjoy an 80% discount on milk (the actual price per pound is 32 cents). This program will surely be welcomed by the community.</p>

<p>The Music Committee of the Municipal Council has been discussing various aspects of the winter concert season for the concert band, as well as improvement measures in general. They were presented at the board meeting on the 19th of this month and adopted for implementation: (1) The winter concert season will now begin at 5:00 or 5:30 PM on Sundays to accommodate the audience. (2) Concerts specifically for young people have been very popular, and it is planned to hold them once a month, in cooperation with the personnel in charge of education, with simple explanations of each movement added on the spot. (3) Public opinion was sought on how the concert band should meet the needs of the audience. Analyzing the answers, it was found that some people hoped to hold popular concerts on weekday evenings. It is now planned to hold them on the first and third Wednesdays of each month. (4) The admission fee for the concerts will remain the same as last year, ranging from 60 cents to 2 yuan. To encourage audiences, it is planned to add sales of ticket booklets, with each booklet containing twelve 2-yuan tickets, selling for 20 yuan, limited to use for twelve consecutive concerts. (5) Music broadcasts will continue to be handled by radio station XOHA, twice a week (page 2), with a fee of 20 yuan per hour. The cost of installing telephone lines is approximately 350 yuan. As for music played during meals, if used to disseminate advertisements, the name of the contractor should be reported to the committee for approval in advance.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Shanghai Bar Association Requests Special Pardon for Qian Shao-feng <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Student's Crime is Filial Piety and Commendable</p>
<p>Lu Zheng Ji-cheng's Case is a Precedent</p>
<p>Student Qian Shao-feng (Pei-gao), a native of An'nan County, Guizhou, is 22 years old and resides at No. 13 Yuanchang Lane, Hualong Road, French Concession, Shanghai. He is a student at a certain middle school. On the afternoon of October 16th of last year, at approximately 7:00 PM, he killed He Zun-fu, the former county magistrate of An'nan County, Guizhou, who was the murderer of his father, with a knife in the Golden Grand Theater. He was then arrested by the French police authorities and handed over to the Second Special District Local Court for prosecution and sentenced to seven years in prison. Qian Shu-sheng, the defense lawyer for Qian Shao-feng, reviewed the case file and found that Qian Shao-feng confessed that his father, Qian Bing, also known as Bin, had served as the director of the Finance Bureau of An'nan County. Due to a dispute with He Zun-fu, the county magistrate, in March of the 20th year of the Republic of China, he colluded with the local garrison and, under a pretext, had Qian Bing shot and killed. Shao-feng fled to Shanghai to study. On the evening of October 16th of last year, he passed by the Golden Grand Theater and saw He Zun-fu entering the theater to watch a movie. He immediately went back to retrieve a knife and sought revenge for his father, killing him. It is understood that seeking revenge for one's father is purely filial piety and commendable. The details of this case have been carefully written in a memorandum and a proposal has been submitted, requesting the Shanghai Bar Association to forward it to the Executive Yuan of the National Government for approval to grant a special pardon and release Qian Shao-feng from prison. It is said that the Shanghai Bar Association has submitted a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees. It was found that in Shandong Province, there was a case of Zheng Ji-cheng, who was also granted a special pardon for killing Zhang Zongchang to avenge his father. This case is similar to Zheng's case, and considering the student's commendable filial piety, a document has already been prepared and submitted to the Executive Yuan of the National Government, requesting that a special pardon be issued to save the decaying customs.</p>

<p>——Answer to Mr. Yuan Qingyan</p>
<p>The above has roughly discussed the attitude towards occupation, but at the same time, one cannot but pay attention to the attitude towards people and the attitude towards colleagues. Otherwise, you still cannot correctly deal with your occupation. - Editor</p>
<p>The second is the attitude towards people. People are always social beings. Society is determined by the stage of economic development at that time. Some people are progressive, and some are conservative. A person who has a good understanding of society is of course worthy of admiration, but there is no need to show any aversion to a person who is muddleheaded or glib. Because this is not only a question of their personal virtue, but the whole thing is caused by the environment. We ourselves are sober, not only should we not despise them, but we should also reflect on ourselves. Before we were sober, weren't we just as confused? We and they are only a hundred steps and fifty steps apart. What is there to be arrogant about? You should take the attitude of Mr. Sun Yat-sen. You are the first to know, and you must awaken those who know later. You have to find a way to awaken them, persuade them, and help create the conditions for them to become sober. You shouldn't let them sleep all the time. This is the correct attitude. If you can't do this, you are already wrong. If you are the only one who is awake, even if you have great abilities, what can you accomplish? You have lofty ideals, you look down on A, and you look down on B. You are indifferent to the people around you, as if they are all hostile to you. You even hate everyone around you. Oh my god, what is the use of those lofty ideals? It cannot grow in the ground, it can only exist in your imagination. What a serious mistake this is! Isn't this clearly departing from reality? Reality is ugly, the present society has diseases, and everyone is now at a dead end. The individual's way out must be based on everyone's way out, so we must all be sober and work together to reform. Now you want everyone in the world to be just like you. If you are not satisfied, you leave them. Isn't this kind of behavior the same as those who live in a drunken dream? And can you really leave them? You can't. There are impure people not only in your rice shop, but everywhere is the same. You hate them, and at the same time you will have to hate everyone in society, you will have to become the protagonist of "Diary of a Madman" (written by Lu Xun). If you really want to leave them, you must also leave life, this is unavoidable! Even if you become a monk, perhaps the monk in your ideal is higher than the monk in reality, and you will have to escape again.</p>

<h3 id="e193">My Questions Regarding Governor Clementi's Speech at the British Malaya Association (Third Continuation) Zhou Qigang <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>(4) The Impact of Clementi's Policy</p>
<p>Although Mr. Clementi is British, he has lived in the East for a long time and has served as the Governor of Hong Kong. He also has studied Chinese language and literature. It was originally very appropriate for the British government to entrust him with the important task of Malaya. In theory, Mr. Clementi should have a deep understanding of China and the Chinese people. However, we associate Mr. Clementi's ban on the Chinese Kuomintang in Malaya with the 1925 (Guangdong-Hong Kong strike) storm. We feel that Mr. Clementi's policies often have unfortunate effects. British government facilities have always had a reputation for being intelligent and steady. Unfortunately, such clumsy and dangerous policies were discovered by Mr. Clementi. This cannot but make people recall the past. That storm occurred just when the Chinese Kuomintang was in power in Guangzhou. It is also possible that Mr. Clementi had some resentment about the past. The relationship between cause and effect is thought-provoking. But we should know that human beings and all living things in the world have the right to exist. Under the situation of common survival, there is only mutual assistance and mutual dependence. If a single kind of powerful force suppresses everything, then the feeling of injustice cannot be vented. Small things will lead to storms, and large things will lead to collapse. This is the first point of our concern about the impact of Mr. Clementi's policy. Since there are many overseas Chinese, the knowledge is uneven. In the past, the overseas Chinese community was divided into different categories, and there were often disputes. Since the establishment of the Kuomintang, it has often been able to come forward to mediate and dissuade these disputes. Historical facts are obvious, and people in Malaya all know this. The existence of the Kuomintang has an impact on the overseas Chinese community, and before the Chinese Kuomintang in Malaya was banned, the belief in the Three People's Principles was established in the minds of overseas Chinese, so that communism and other dangerous ideas could not invade. The actions of Kuomintang members are open and aboveboard, and can be seen at a glance. For more than ten years, they have never caused difficulties for the resident government overseas. Since Mr. Clementi banned the activities of the Kuomintang, the Communist Party has taken the opportunity to become active, secretly inciting and infiltrating everywhere. Recently, the forces of communism are said to have spread to the mines and farms of Malaya. It is difficult for the colonial government to distinguish between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party members, and the danger is difficult to prevent. This is the second point of our concern about the impact of Mr. Clementi's policy.</p>
<p>(5) Conclusion</p>
<p>To sum up, the Chinese Kuomintang has its own history of evolution overseas, especially in Malaya. Mr. Clementi's understanding of the situation of the Chinese Kuomintang in Malaya is insufficient, so the means he took are indeed regrettable. Whether the later governors will continue to implement the policies of open-mindedness, sincerity, and good neighborliness of the past British government and previous governors is also worthy of our attention. Now I hope that the overseas Chinese and Kuomintang members will, based on the spirit of coexistence and co-prosperity that has always been followed, work harder in Malaya to protect the local government and work with the local people to maintain prosperity. This is also the sympathy of the British government and Chinese and British people.</p>

<h3 id="e194">Cultural Backwardness and Overproduction in the Publishing Industry <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Yin Ming</p>
<p>Just as China is an economically backward country that also experiences overproduction, China is a culturally backward country that also experiences overproduction in the publishing industry. We used to see signs and advertisements for big spring sales and big autumn sales at large companies and stores, and now it's the publishing industry's turn. Look, isn't almost the entire Shanghai publishing industry, including Commercial Press, Zhonghua Book Company, World Book Company, Kaiming Bookstore, Beixin Bookstore, etc., holding big clearance sales and auctions? Moreover, they are entrusting the post office to purchase books and magazines on their behalf, banks are offering free remittances, and all kinds of sales methods are being used. Isn't this a phenomenon unique to a period of overproduction?</p>
<p>Is there really overproduction in the publishing industry that exceeds the needs of the Chinese people? I'm afraid no one can say that! In reality, apart from textbooks, among general publications, even very popular books that are suitable for the masses, very few can print tens of thousands of copies per edition and sell several editions a year. As for more profound theoretical readings, each edition is only printed in one to two thousand copies, and it often takes three or four years to sell one edition. With a population of 400 million and a 5,000-year cultural history, can we say there is overproduction when China only absorbs such a small amount of intellectual products?</p>
<p>Take our eastern neighbor as an example. With a population of only 60 million, it is very common for publications to sell tens or hundreds of editions in a few years. No wonder we are invaded by others. Just from this point of view, we are far behind.</p>
<p>What is the reason for this contradictory phenomenon of backwardness (which can also be said to be insufficiency) and overproduction? In my observation, like economic backwardness and overproduction, the main reasons are nothing more than the following two: (1) Cultural backwardness itself. The general cultural backwardness means that there are very few people with the ability to read, and almost the entire country is illiterate, resulting in a very low capacity to absorb intellectual products. Even within the small number of publications, overproduction is inevitable. (2) The impact of the economic panic. Most of those who can read and buy books are petty-bourgeois intellectuals. In recent years, affected by the economic panic in our country and the world, rural and urban middle and small classes have gone bankrupt, and intellectuals have lost their schooling and jobs, struggling to make a living. How can they have the spare money to buy books? How can publications not feel overproduction?</p>
<p>Originally, cultural products are the commodities of intellectuals (of course, there is also a layer of exploitation by booksellers in between; intellectuals are to booksellers as workers are to capitalists). Stagnant sales of commodities will affect factory closures and worker unemployment, and cultural workers are certainly no exception.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, the first refuge for intellectuals is the education sector, but the education sector has long declared bankruptcy. The last and more difficult refuge is the publishing industry, but the situation in the publishing industry is like this. Some people say that the intellectual class has reached the end of the road this year. Although this is not entirely true, it is probably not far off.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Yearning for Foreign Lands <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Jun</p>
<p>September dreams are light, as light as leaves falling from branches, bearing no weight. It is the most suitable season for missing someone! Although the grass and flowers in front of me have quietly withered by the low fence, faintly bearing the resentment of fading away; the white chrysanthemums are gradually blooming, facing the warm sunlight.</p>
<p>A kind of misty melancholy, like light smoke, climbs into my heart, and then climbs past it. As a result, I don't know why, but some regretful emotions arise. It's as if something is secretly holding me back. Therefore, my heart, my thoughts, have left this place, and like a pair of soaring swallows, fly over layers of mountains and layers of seas, to that distant, bright, ideal horizon. Although my body is bound by the present situation and has to stay here, my whole soul can be intoxicated in the dreamland of foreign lands day and night. Even if the scenery here can linger a little longer in my mind, giving me a little more warm and intimate feeling, it is still the last time. Yes, it's not that everything here is completely devoid of places that make me miss it. For this clear blue sky in September, the charming seasonal dreams, the bunches of late-ripening blood-red purple grapes overlapping on the rattan frame, smilingly adorable, and having whispered with a woman I admired among the grapevines, shoulder to shoulder, counting the stars in the sky together, humming the sweet Remona melody.</p>
<p>However, this period of soft life is rapidly passing away. Just like every flower, it bloomed and then withered. Moreover, when the autumn wind is already freezing into icicles in the northern country, will there still be pink shadows appearing from the snow? So I remained silent, simply discarding those past events. No nostalgia, no sighs, no tears, I plucked all the things that had taken root in my heart with all my might, threw them behind my head, and never looked back. I have already embraced new yearnings, replacing everything of the past.</p>
<p>I yearn for wandering in a foreign country, and I especially yearn for the elegant, beautiful, and affectionate waitresses in the cafes, following every stranger as eagerly as if they had met a long-lost lover. Every foreigner likes to immerse themselves in these places, and the lonely heart of a traveler will also feel comforted by this. To appreciate the taste of foreign customs!</p>
<p>The desire to appreciate the customs of the distant island on the other side has become an acute appetite disorder of the spirit recently, and I wish I could immediately grow wings under my arms and fly over there. Each day I can't go increases the weight of my worries, and this weight may increase to the point of crushing my body.</p>
<p>When will my fantasies bear fruit, this yearning for foreign lands!</p>

<p>— Wang Fuquan</p>
<p>Similarly, it is very common to use European languages for units of measurement, with Chinese added above and below, such as "一(磅)朱奶" (one (pound) Zhunai [brand name of milk]), "一(听)(香烟)" (one (tin) (cigarettes)), etc. There is also a type of specialized term that becomes a "Chinese + European + Chinese" form, such as "(新)(罗曼)(主义)" ((New)(Romantic)(ism)), "(社会主义)(苏维埃)(共和国联盟)" ((Socialist)(Soviet)(Republic Union)) (Soviet originally meant council or committee), "(三)(A)(政策)" ((Three)(A)(Policy)), "(三)(B)(政策)" ((Three)(B)(Policy)), "(三)(C)(政策)" ((Three)(C)(Policy)), "(三)(K)(党)" ((Three)(K)(Party)), etc.</p>
<p>Several suffixes can also be pointed out.</p>
<p>-ize, -eify (化 -hua) | Idealize, scientize, commercialize, commoditize, automatize, literaryize, Europeanize</p>
<p>-ism (主义 zhuyi, 论 lun, 说 shuo, 制 zhi, 教 jiao) | Syndicalism, capitalism, the Three Principles of the People, naturalism; monism, pluralism, idealism, materialism, atomism, positivism; anthropocentrism, geocentrism, the doctrine of the creation of the soul, intellectualism, emotionalism, voluntarism; clan communism, promiscuity, monometallism, bimetallism, mixed gold-silver standard. Some are translated as "教" (jiao, religion), such as "拜物教" (baiwujiao, fetishism) (or translated as "灵物崇拜" (lingwu chongbai, spirit worship)).</p>
<p>-ty (性 xing) | Causality, generality, necessity, reality.</p>
<p>self (本身 benshen) | This thing itself, the text itself, science itself, he himself (or himself).</p>
<p>-tic (的 de) | Objective, active, absolute, leisurely, literary. "tic" is sometimes transliterated, such as "罗曼谛克" (luomandike, romantic).</p>
<p>In addition, such as "logy" being translated as "学" (xue, study), even our sages' classics have been Europeanized into "经学" (jingxue, classical studies). (There is also a very commonly used word "被" (bei, passive marker), such as "被选举权" (beixuanjuquan, right to be elected), "被压迫民族" (beiyapo minzu, oppressed nations), "被支配阶级" (beizhipei jieji, dominated class). This may have come from Japan.)</p>
<p>There are also quite a few prefixes.</p>
<p>anti- (反 fan) | Anti-revolution, anti-imperialist alliance, anti-Semitism.</p>
<p>Pan- (泛 fan) | Panpsychism, pansophy, Pan-European Union, Pan-Slavism, Pan-Pacific Science Conference.</p>
<p>un-, non- (不 bu, 非 fei) | Non-exhaustive, recession, unnatural; non-war, non-militarism.</p>
<p>Quasi- (准 zhun) | Quasi-national, quasi-criminal.</p>
<p>super- (超 chao) | Superman, super-economic exploitation, supraorganism, supernatural, supermoralism.</p>
<p>New- (新 xin) | New culture, Neo-Romanticism, Neo-Realism, New Economic Policy, Neo-Kantianism, new record, (New) economics (this "new" is a special usage from a technical point of view, but this type of usage is also very common).</p>
<p>The research on morphology is not very complicated and I also plan to write a little about it; as for syntax and rhetoric, it is not something that can be written down in a short time. As for the analysis of content, this is an even more arduous task and will have to wait until there is some progress in the history of various academic disciplines before starting.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Nature <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Kong Gong</p>
<p>People over the age of twenty gradually become thick-skinned and deep-hearted, unable to discern truth, falsehood, good, or evil. It is in old age, in childhood, or by chance that one can see the original face of humanity. This is what is called nature.</p>
<p>The Confucian division of pre-heaven and post-heaven is a wonderful interpretation. For thousands of years, mankind has desperately sought the so-called human nature, the original face of man, and finally, there has been no more perfect answer. But putting aside good and evil, the division between pre-heaven and post-heaven can explain many things. And human actions have not yet exceeded this range.</p>
<p>Just look at soldiers killing people, humans even eating human flesh during famines. What is different from children torturing insects, killing a bird, or killing a frog? The thought of sin is there at first, but it soon becomes natural (habit becomes second nature), because this is innate. It is not that there are so-called seeds of sin innately, but that the inherent nature of human beings, who have evolved to the present, is like this. So-called life and death are trivial matters.</p>
<p>However, mankind has stubbornly (evolved), and in fact, on the other hand, hasn't it degenerated, declined, established many names for the distinction between good and evil, for the standard of who should and should not survive? Therefore, the world is in turmoil, right and wrong are turned upside down, good people die early, and evil people prosper. Mankind constantly remakes weights and measures, but as a result, it has never measured the length or shortness of nature by an inch.</p>

<p>— Yu Shixia</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>(Treat the head when it hurts, treat the foot when it hurts.)</p>
<p>This saying is probably not only popular in Hunan. It doesn't consider the overall connection of things, only deals with them piecemeal; it doesn't solve them from the root, only handles the minor details. It's really a bit like "Treat the head when it hurts, treat the foot when it hurts!"</p>
<p>Headaches have always been my old problem. I remember when I was twelve or thirteen years old, I was studying at a normal school and suffered from malaria one summer. I was sick for more than two years in a row. Malaria is called "da baizi" (getting the shakes) in Hunan, and it is said that it is caused by "baizi" ghosts. At first, my "baizi" came every other day, then every two or three days, and then every ten or so days. Finally, it came on cloudy days and when it was windy and rainy, without a fixed date. When the "baizi" came, I always felt cold and shivering, my whole body trembling, and even covering myself with two or three quilts couldn't stop the cold. After the cold passed, I would have a fever, and my head would be dizzy and my eyes would blur, which was really uncomfortable. Usually, when the "baizi" didn't come, my head also felt heavy, and sometimes it felt very empty, and my feet had no strength, so I rarely went out. I was so weak and sickly that my classmates thought I was going to die young. Who knew that I haven't died yet, and several of those who were afraid that I would die young have already died!</p>
<p>For more than ten years, because the overall collapse of the rural economy has become more profound, my family's situation as a small landlord can no longer maintain the same state of well-being as before. Although I have never dreamed of inheriting a large fortune, I am also ashamed that I have no ability to reverse the family's misfortune under the general trend of economic bankruptcy. In addition, I got married and had children, and the burden became heavier day by day, and all kinds of worries came upon me. Fortunately, my body has become stronger day by day, not as thin as before, and my head no longer hurts. Although I have suffered from stomach problems for several years in these more than ten years, and I also had a dangerous appendicitis inflammation last year, my body gradually recovered after the illness. It seems that the Creator deliberately teased me, telling my body to be a little stronger so that I could bear this heavy burden of a miserable life. How can I put down this heavy burden?</p>
<p>My head no longer hurts, but my feet often itch and ache, and I didn't regard this rotten foot as a disease, but thought it was "Hunan foot," which Hunan people can't avoid.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Mr. Village Head (7) <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Renshu</p>
<p>(That way, that way...)</p>
<p>Finally, trembling, one of them spoke inside.</p>
<p>"So what are your plans? I have to report to the superiors." The village head parted his knees, calmly, but furrowed his brow and said.</p>
<p>"Exempt, exempt, exempt from... can it be exempt?" These words were like timid mice, only sticking their heads out of the hole. Using the greatest courage, they only chewed out that half a sentence.</p>
<p>"How to exempt? How to exempt?" The village head shouted angrily. "You country bumpkins are really unreasonable. It wasn't me who told you to go. This is an order from above! For you, I have really worn out the soles of my feet, and spoken until my teeth bleed. But the district chief always blames me!</p>
<p>"No way! No way! No matter what! The first batch must be fifty! Fifty! Fifty! There are five of you in the three villages above and below, isn't five a lot?"</p>
<p>"The district chief is still forcing me to hand over people today. I have no way, so I tricked him. (Wait until tomorrow! Wait until tomorrow!) But tomorrow will pass! Damn it! What an unlucky year! I don't want to do this lousy job anymore..."</p>
<p>"That won't work! You still have to be the village head." Pretending to laugh. They must flatter the superiors, that is their philosophy of life.</p>
<p>"Yes. That can't be refused." Dong Sheng, who was standing on the side with a lame hand, also joined in, saying: "Besides you and Mr. Dasheng, who else in the village can be the village head? Mr. Dasheng is a person who chants Amitabha and doesn't care about other things, chanting the rules of wine accounts and cigarette accounts all day long... never has any free time."</p>
<p>"Don't talk nonsense!" Turning his face, he shot a glance at Duosheng. Also tsked. "What do you want to do?"</p>
<p>Advocacy? No one had any. Do these people still need to have advocacy?</p>

<p>Opening of the Xing'an District Mongolian Military Academy</p>
<p>Concord Association Anesthetizes Eastern Mongolian Princes</p>
<p>Preparations Begin for the Academy of Continental Sciences</p>
<p>(Northeast News Agency, Changchun) In order to enslave the youth of the entire Manchuria, the Japanese are doing their best to manipulate and anesthetize education. Recently, in addition to establishing the Mongolian Military Academy in the Xing'an District to cultivate slave officers for their sacrifice, they also convened a meeting of Mongolian princes in the name of the Concord Association, inducing Mongolian people to be pro-Japanese and support Manchukuo. They are also actively preparing for the Academy of Continental Sciences in Changchun. Details of each situation are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e202">Xing'an Military Academy <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>In order to assimilate the Mongolians, the Japanese, in the name of the puppet government, established the Xing'an Military Academy in Zhengjiatun, selecting young and strong soldiers (Mongolians) aged seventeen to twenty-one from various garrison troops in Xing'an Province to train them in Japanese-style military education, so that they will serve as officers in the reformed Mongolian army in the future. The internal organization of the school includes the adjutant's office, the military affairs office, the medical affairs office, the education department, the police department, and the student team. The Kwantung Army dispatched 43 Japanese officers to serve in academic and administrative duties. The student team is divided into two companies, with 120 people. The duration of study is two years, the first year being preparatory and the second year being undergraduate. Classes began on July 1. Also, one of this year's pseudo-national policies, the Academy of Continental Science Research, has been prepared by the Accounting Department of the puppet State Council. The candidate for president was appointed by Endo, Director of the General Affairs Department of the puppet State Council, when he took him to Tokyo this time. Dr. Masatoshi Okawauchi, Viscount and Member of the Japanese House of Peers, was appointed, and three technicians from the Japanese Ministry of Finance, including Takeo Fujii, were also invited to Manchuria to preside over the work. Preparations have now begun, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Enslavement Propaganda <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>The Central Affairs Bureau of the Changchun Puppet Concord Association has repeatedly sent propaganda and investigation personnel to the Mongolian banners of Rehe to lure Mongolian princes with benefits (purchasing horses), with the intention of uniting the Mongolian banners of Rehe and incorporating them into the Xing'an General Administration, so as to further penetrate the Mongolian region, absorb the Mongolian princes of Chahar and Suiyuan, and use the assistance of autonomy to build the Mongolian Empire and restore the great cause of Genghis Khan, in preparation for plotting Mongolia in the future. The intention is far-reaching and cannot be ignored. At the same time, the Mongolian Military Academy was established in the Manchurian Railway Public Office in Zhengjiatun.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Geneva Chinese Painting Exhibition <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>More than 46,000 Visitors</p>
<p>Rolland Romain Extols Vigorously</p>
<p>Since our government dispatched Liu Haisu to Germany last year to exhibit Chinese paintings and promote Eastern art, grand Chinese painting exhibitions have been held successively in Berlin, Hamburg, cities along the Rhine River, as well as Amsterdam and The Hague in the Netherlands, all of which have garnered great acclaim. This summer, upon the invitation of the Swiss government and the Geneva municipal government, Liu once again brought his entire collection of 280 works to Geneva for a public exhibition lasting one month. We have now received a letter from Geneva detailing the situation of this exhibition, and we present a summary below. Geneva is a world-famous city, the center of international politics and a cultural hub. The Chinese painting exhibition was held in the Municipal Historical Art Museum, a magnificent stone structure with exquisite carvings, spanning hundreds of feet in the center of Geneva. The entrance is solemn and several feet high, with a park outside. The interior lighting is suitable, and our country's famous works are displayed within, complementing each other perfectly. July 19th was the official opening day of the Chinese painting exhibition. Prior to this, the municipal government widely distributed invitations, inviting celebrities and scholars from various countries residing in Geneva. At this time, the International Cultural Conference was being held in Geneva, so dignitaries from various countries gathered there. Former French Prime Minister Édouard Herriot and literary giant Romain Rolland also attended the event. Rolland praised it incessantly, saying, "Chinese painters, after a process of soulful brewing and disciplined synthesis of various natural impressions, re-express a new, complete, and ideal world. This is true art." Rolland is a great literary figure of our time, wielding authority in the modern ideological world, and his comments are conclusive. A certain Japanese representative to the International Cultural Conference stated that the splendor and magnificence of modern Chinese painting are unmatched by Japanese painters. The great critic Hugger, in a review published in the Geneva News, said, "Chinese painting techniques have a completely different starting point from European art, but among the millions of viewers, there is unanimous sympathy and praise for this Chinese painting exhibition, and they can understand it thoroughly without confusion. It can be seen that the transcendental ideals of the East are gradually being accepted and absorbed by Westerners. We Westerners have been bound by material things for too long. Chinese art respects individuality, respects the self, and applies the spirit of the self to objective materials. For example, painting the flowers of the four seasons, or the Three Friends of Winter (pine, bamboo, and plum), is never tiresome and is handled in a cyclical manner, achieving a profound effect with its constantly vivid rhythms." He added, "I predict that this Chinese painting exhibition will have a tremendous impact on the European art scene."</p>
<p>After Mr. and Mrs. Liu Haisu arrived in Geneva, they were welcomed by the audience every time they attended the event. Many painters asked Liu to purchase Chinese paper, brushes, ink, and colors. An elderly painter over seventy years old, Bcrun, tightly grasped Liu's hand in the crowd, insisted on seeing Liu's painting of a large pine, and asked for paper and ink, saying, "Seeing Chinese painting has solved my decades of torment. For decades, I have been a mere imitator of nature, simply depicting a semblance of the natural world. Now, my artistic demands lie elsewhere." The Chinese painting exhibition in Geneva lasted for one month, with a total of more than 46,000 visitors. More than 200 artists were represented. It is reported that the exhibition will move to Bern, the capital of Switzerland, on August 25th.</p>

<h3 id="e205">Educational Situation in Various Counties of Zhejiang Province Nearing Stagnation <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>Direct Shortfall of Over One Million Yuan in Funding</p>
<p>Nearly 20,000 Teachers and Staff Will Lose Their Jobs</p>
<p>The Number of Children and Adults Out of School Will Increase by 400,000</p>
<p>The sources of local education funding in various counties of Zhejiang Province are mainly land tax surcharges, land rent, and local taxes. Over the years, due to repeated disasters and poor harvests, rural areas have gone bankrupt, and land tax collection has fallen short, to the extent that the funds of various counties have been almost exhausted, and most counties are in debt by several thousand to tens of thousands of yuan. The situation in various counties was already extremely difficult this year. In recent months, some local taxes were deemed excessively burdensome and were abolished by the provincial government, which was announced in early August. The provincial government will find other ways to compensate for the loss, but subsidies will only be available from October. August and September have already been announced as abolished, and collection is impossible. These funds have already been greatly affected. Now, after a severe drought, disaster areas are spread throughout the province. Although the busy season for land tax collection has been extended to February, many counties have collected less than 10% of the amount. With the regular tax insufficient, the surcharge will naturally fall short as well. As for land rent, there is even less rent to collect. It is estimated that the annual expenditure budget for education funding in various counties and cities of Zhejiang Province is approximately 3.3 million yuan, excluding district funds and private school expenses. There are approximately 12,000 elementary schools, 2,400 people's schools, 31,000 elementary school teachers and staff, 6,000 people's school teachers and staff, 710,000 elementary school students, and 100,000 people's school students. Furthermore, of the 3.3 million yuan in education funding from various counties, approximately 1.98 million yuan comes from land tax and 250,000 yuan from school land rent, accounting for approximately two-thirds of the total education funding in various counties, all of which are directly affected by the disaster. Even if the income for this year is calculated at an average of 50%, there will still be a shortfall of over 1.1 million yuan. The impact of other miscellaneous tax reductions and exemptions, as well as district funds and private schools, is not included in this figure. Based on the current situation, if even half of the elementary and people's schools in various counties are forced to close, nearly 20,000 elementary and people's school teachers and staff will lose their jobs, and over 350,000 elementary school students and over 50,000 adults will be out of school. The crisis is intensifying, and if no appropriate solution is found, the future is unimaginable.</p>

Secondary education will receive a total of 426,097 yuan, a decrease of over 33,000 yuan compared to the previous year. Higher education will receive a total of 273,960 yuan, a saving of 16,000 yuan compared to the previous year. The remaining budgets, such as primary education, private school subsidies, and departmental expenses, remain the same as the previous year with no increases or decreases.</p>

Each school should hold a preliminary exhibition of the holiday homework results of children in grades 3 and above on any Sunday before the date of the Holiday Homework Exhibition Conference convened by the Bureau, and then select excellent works according to the stipulated standards and send them to the conference for display. What each school must pay attention to is that this kind of results exhibition is to examine the true situation of children's holiday homework, so that it can be used as a mirror to promote children's extracurricular activities in the future and to seek a practical connection between family and school. Therefore, the exhibits should be absolutely authentic and should never be false. The conference has been scheduled to be held at the Municipal Wanzhu Elementary School from October 20th. All municipal and registered private elementary schools should send exhibits to the conference on time for display. This order is for compliance and implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Preparatory Exhibition <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>

<p>Comic books in bookstores are too numerous to count, with superficial ideas and deep-seated drawbacks. Since the Municipal Bureau of Education transferred various comic books to the Central Review Committee for Books and Magazines for review, the work has been very tense. The Shanghai Press reporter met with Mr. , a member and secretary of the committee yesterday. According to the discussion, most of the comic books depict feudal ideas of emperors and superstition, and there are few that are purely taken from materials and centered on national consciousness. In order to remedy this, the committee will periodically convene writers together with the Municipal Education Bureau for a discussion and give them practical guidance.</p>

<h3 id="e216">New Work in the Fanwangdu Universal Education Experiment Zone <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>The Fanwangdu Universal Education Experiment Zone in this port is jointly operated by Datong University and the Huxi Nian'ershe. The goal of the experiment is to implement people's livelihood-oriented education, with saving the nation and preventing its demise as the backbone, advocating the use of domestic goods, promoting social frugality, striving for social production, developing the rural economy, improving the lives of the people, and jointly planning the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. The experimental method is to take the entire area as a whole educational place, cancel the school form, and all education starts from the economy. The methods of class starting and dismissal, winter and summer vacations, semesters, and academic years are abolished. In order to implement this ideal, the area specially invited Mr. Shuangqiu to create a universal education vehicle. Mr. began to study and experiment with it last fall, and completed one this spring. It is shaped like a wooden box, about two feet long and high, and about one foot wide. A blackboard is set up on the top, and the upper layer is divided into several compartments to place samples of agricultural products and seeds for exhibition at any time. The lower layer is also divided into several compartments, which can be used to place educational supplies and health supplies. There is also a movable wooden frame on the vehicle, which can hang several kinds of popular readings. There are four wheels underneath, which can be pushed to various places, or sent to the education department, or sent to the field for education. It has all the functions of a classroom, a mobile library, and a mobile exhibition. Mr. Tai has recently realized that education funding is the foundation for promoting universal education, and in order to expand the effectiveness of the vehicle, he has reproduced a larger universal education vehicle, which is about twice the size of the previous one, and has the functions of a classroom, exhibition hall, mobile book vehicle, mobile bookstore, and bedding, etc. The vehicle is also equipped with a movable cloth curtain, which can cover more than a dozen people when it is opened, and takes up very little space when folded and placed on the vehicle. There are also seven movable benches inside, which can seat fourteen people, which is especially convenient when teaching. The purpose of this vehicle is to promote domestic goods, relieve youth, improve rural areas, and popularize education. According to the person in charge of the area, starting this fall, they plan to recruit several young people with junior high school education as universal education service personnel to promote domestic goods and promote education at the same time. The living expenses of the personnel will be taken from the commission earned from promoting domestic goods. The detailed methods have been formulated and will be implemented soon.</p>

<h3 id="e218">Renqing Memorial School Actively Preparing <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>Xia Zhiqi, courtesy name Renqing, a senior member of the Party and the nation, was posthumously awarded the rank of General of the Army (yesterday's newspaper mistakenly wrote Xia Chao). He was from Qingtian, Zhejiang Province. In the third year of the Republic of China, he engaged in secret anti-Yuan work with Fan Hongxian. After Fan was killed in Shanghai, the five secret organizations organized and presided over by Xia in Hangzhou were also destroyed, and more than 30 party members were arrested. Xia was also arrested. In memory of Mr. Xia, key Party and national figures, including Mr. Puquan, initiated the establishment of the Renqing Memorial School. It has been a year since the start of preparations. According to Xia Xiaoxia, the son of the martyr Xia, the school's preparations have been as follows: After Mr. Zhang proposed the school, many people were listed as initiators at one time, and a preparatory committee was organized. In addition to the initiators and family members, famous people at home and abroad were widely invited to be members of the committee. The preparatory office is located at No. 27 Wanyi Lane, Luban Road, in this port. It is now actively soliciting funds from all walks of life. Yang Gengguang, Wang Rutang, Qu Wenliu, and Wang Yiting are all responsible for fundraising, and have contacted the Central China, Communications, and Ju Yu Cheng Banks to collect donations on their behalf. As for the location, Mr. has designated it to be under the Nanping . The location is between West Lake and the Qiantang River, far from the city, and is very suitable for students to study diligently. In order to ensure the school's solid foundation and perfect facilities, it is necessary to wait until a large amount of money has been raised and the school buildings have been completed before the school can be opened. Therefore, it is hoped that those who are enthusiastic about education at home and abroad will donate generously. Mr. Xia is scheduled to go to Jiangxi to pay respects to Chairman Chiang and the Chairman of Jiangxi Province, Mr. Xiong , to request assistance with funds, and plans to contact various parties to receive donations. It is expected that once Mr. Zhang Puquan returns from the south, he can proceed actively.</p>

<p>Chronicles of Xiaoxitian Spring and Autumn by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Two: Acting as a Merchant Enters the Folk Road, Returns to Yongshou, Bids Farewell, a Heavenly Person Arrives in Chang'an</p>
<p>Cheng Zhi felt that this person was tactless and became sullen, looking up at the mausoleum. Only then did Zhang Jiefu stop talking. This mausoleum was about five or six zhang high and seven or eight zhang long, resembling a small mound. Because the front of the mausoleum was the back of the main hall, there was no open space for maneuvering. A tall stele stood in front of the mausoleum, boldly inscribed "Tomb of King Wen of Zhou." Behind this mausoleum, about forty or fifty zhang away, was another mausoleum, accessible via a stone pine path. A dozen or so small steles lined both sides of the path, serving as minimal decorations. In front of the mausoleum was also a large stele, inscribed "Tomb of King Wu of Zhou." The open space around the mausoleum was vast and empty, with only some Chinese toon saplings planted. There were two types of Chinese toon: one was fragrant toon, whose buds could be eaten as vegetables, and the other was stinky toon, whose branches were extremely fragile and easily broken, exuding an unpleasant odor in the sap—these were the ones planted here. These toon saplings were less than two chi tall, with finger-thick trunks protruding from the weeds, spaced four or five steps apart, swaying forlornly in the wind. Even in Cheng Zhi's eyes, the place seemed exceedingly desolate. This was after the director and ministers had visited and ordered renovations. Had one come here before the renovations, they would likely have seen only two overgrown, weedy mounds. Seeing their silence, Director Chang asked with a smile, "Mr. Cheng, what are your impressions after visiting this place?" Cheng Zhiqian replied, "I think most people who come to visit the Northwest feel similarly—that it's cold and harsh. I also believe that the scenic spots here shouldn't be too extravagant. Excessive extravagance would make people think, 'Living people don't have enough to eat, so why is there money to decorate the tombs of the dead?'" Director Chang clapped his hands twice, saying, "Excellent, excellent! If everyone who comes to the Northwest had this perspective, we would welcome them wholeheartedly."</p>
<p>(Papa) (Mama)</p>
<p>Recently, Japanese Minister of Education Matsuda banned children in elementary schools and kindergartens nationwide from using the terms "(Papa)" and "(Mama)," claiming they harm Japanese customs. What are the traditional Japanese customs? Matsuda didn't say. How much harm do Japanese children using "(Papa)" and "(Mama)" cause to Japanese customs? He also didn't say. If "(Papa)" and "(Mama)" are banned, what terms does Matsuda plan to replace them with? He didn't say either. Although this is a trivial issue that seems to carry a hint of "effeminacy," because Matsuda is Japan's Minister of Education and we see his opinions published in the newspapers as so "refined," it makes one feel a noteworthy interest.</p>
<p>In China, if children speak Mandarin, they mostly call their fathers "(Papa)" and their mothers "(Mama)." This terminology has a long history and is very common. But in Japan, Matsuda says they harm the country's customs. What does he mean? It's impossible to guess. If it's because Chinese children are shouting "(Papa)" and "(Mama)," and it's believed that Japanese children are influenced by China, hindering the country's customs, then if this assumption is correct, Matsuda's "Yamato" spirit is worthy of admiration!</p>
<p>In China, what we see and hear are indeed many Western terms! And it cannot be said that there are few Eastern terms either. But the Chinese use "promotion" instead of "prohibition," so Chinese customs are always so bad, so bad that even "(Papa)" and "(Mama)" are banished to the cold palace! (?)</p>
<p>Here, I have another thought.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, "(Papa)" and "(Mama)," especially "(Mama)," call their own children "(Younger Brother)" and "(Younger Sister)," abandoning the former style of "(Sweetheart)" and "(Treasure)"; who started this? What does it mean? It's unfathomable! I think Matsuda rarely hears this kind of "(neither fish nor fowl)" terminology! If Japanese "(Papa)" and "(Mama)" must be banished to the cold palace, what should be done with Shanghai's "(Younger Brother)" and "(Younger Sister)"? Should this unique Chinese "innovation" be encouraged and promoted? I hope our "(Minister of Education)" can publish some insights!</p>

<p>Casual Chat on Eyebrow Painting by Qifenglou Lord</p>
<p>Loving beauty is human nature, especially for women. Modern women today compete in adornment. Besides clothing, they also engage in beautifying their faces, blending powder and rouge, gently applying and smoothing, admiring their reflections in the mirror countless times. Adding eyebrow painting is considered an important task, as slender crescent brows arched into the temples indeed possess unique charm. However, in the past, women mostly lightly applied kohl to their eyebrows or simply burned willow branches to add a touch of color. Nowadays, so-called socialites and beauties have escalated the practice, creating new styles. They shave off their natural eyebrows entirely and freely apply imported eyebrow cream to repaint them. Nothing could be more contradictory! Is it an attempt to change one's heart by first changing one's face? Occasionally, when I talk to them, they retort, "Have you not heard of Zhang Jingzhao painting eyebrows? The ancients created it, and we, the descendants, follow it. It doesn't seem excessive, so why criticize us so harshly!" I silently withdraw, pondering the legacy of Jingzhao.</p>
<p>According to records, Zhang Jingzhao, named Chang, a descendant of later generations, once served as the magistrate of Jingzhao, hence the name. He once painted eyebrows for his wife, which later generations admired and considered a romantic affair. However, I heard from an elder that "Jingzhao's eyebrow painting was not solely for enhancing his wife's beauty. There was another love story behind it, one filled with tender and poignant emotions. It is said that Chang, in his childhood, was handsome and charming. One night, he dreamed of an old man with a white beard who, upon being asked about his ideal partner, pointed to a girl in a straw pile in the tofu shop next door, saying, 'This is your wife.' The next day, he went to see her. The girl was crying, dirty, with tears and snot streaming down her face. Chang, young and impetuous, was furious at the sight! He picked up a stone and threw it at the girl's face, intending to flee, thinking he would find a better match. As a result, the girl only had a break in her left eyebrow, and fortunately, she was unharmed. Later, the girl grew up and was adopted by a gentleman as his adopted daughter. At this time, Chang had also become an official and had a good reputation, which the gentleman heard of. Learning that he was unmarried, he married his adopted daughter to Chang. On the wedding night, the candlelight illuminated her red makeup, revealing her graceful figure. However, there was a break in her eyebrows. When asked about it, the girl told him about the incident from years ago. Chang was filled with shame and guilt! He quickly picked up a brush and painted a continuation to cover the mark," and so on.</p>
<p>In summary, Chang painted eyebrows for his wife to cover a scar. Compared to modern women's artificiality, the intentions are vastly different.</p>
<p>A Fragrant Cloud of Eastern Incense by Princess Der Ling, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>After they finished playing the Marseillaise, she specifically instructed Li Lianying to personally retrieve all the instruments, one by one, so she could examine them repeatedly. At the same time, she had them perch side by side on a beautifully designed branch. At each end of the branch, there was a small white jade cup filled with water and food for them to eat and drink. Upon seeing this special gift, the Empress Dowager seemed extremely pleased. She even thought she couldn't see clearly enough, so she instructed Li Lianying to bring it closer, about two or three feet away from her, so she could examine it carefully. At that time, we couldn't help but laugh secretly, thinking that these two parrots were just ordinary birds and didn't deserve the Empress Dowager's attention, treating them with such seriousness! Unexpectedly, after two or three minutes, they immediately showed their special talents, surprising everyone. One of the two parrots suddenly cried out in a clear voice, "Long live the Empress Dowager!" This cry completely astonished everyone! Especially because its pronunciation was so accurate, it sounded exactly like a child speaking, which made people even more astonished. Just as everyone was whispering and marveling, the other parrot suddenly shouted, "Peace to the Empress Dowager!"</p>
<p>I think Yuan Shikai must have put a lot of effort into making these two birds speak such clear phrases. At the very least, he must have had someone who was skilled at raising birds teach them for him. Otherwise, even if they could speak, they wouldn't be able to say it so perfectly at the right time.</p>

<p>The Physiognomy of Shuang Yu's Painting and Calligraphy by Yin</p>
<p>Mr. Tang Dingzhi, a descendant of Qin Yin, recently adopted the alias Shuang Yu Daoren. Anyone who knows Dingzhi should understand the meaning behind it. There are many examples of using aliases to depict the past and present, but none are as humorous as these two characters. Daoren's paintings excel in their unconstrained style, particularly his large-scale works. Last year, he created twelve eight-foot screens for a certain gentleman, which were admired by all who saw them. This is because Daoren entered painting through calligraphy, and his calligraphy is like a celestial horse soaring through the sky, unbound. I remember when Daoren traveled in Guangdong and Guangxi, he enjoyed composing poems. Friends once praised him for his mastery of painting, calligraphy, and poetry. Since the Restoration, he has stopped discussing poetry and devoted himself to physiognomy, which he highly values. He even ranks physiognomy, calligraphy, and painting as his three excellences. This is probably Tang Jun's self-deprecation, meant ironically.</p>
<p>Small Recipe: Local Mooncakes and Cantonese Mooncakes by Zhang Huang</p>
<p>The Chinese people are most unwilling to easily let go of their culinary pleasures. Whenever major or minor festivals arrive, every household, big and small, always prepares one or several customary foods that are considered essential for the occasion, ostensibly as a formality, but in reality, it is for the sake of the public's palate.</p>
<p>During the Mid-Autumn Festival, the most luminous and spherical moon in nature is at its prime, so the symbolic mooncakes also occupy a prominent position among the timely foods. Are these foods particularly unique or independent in taste or crafting techniques? They use the same ingredients as ordinary cakes, dumplings, and buns, making dough for the skin and filling it with sweet or savory ingredients. If the filling is more precious, the taste will be more palatable.</p>
<p>Jiangnan, the prosperous land of abundance, produces exquisite products renowned throughout the country. Moreover, the meticulous Suzhou people, known for their delicate snacks (tea cakes), earn some respect for the Zhejiang people. However, on such a major holiday, the timely mooncakes, whether sold in stores or made privately (in fact, very few people make mooncakes themselves), are not particularly outstanding in taste. The most frustrating experience occurred in my childhood when an elder gave me a box of four Suzhou-style sweet mooncakes. The box was made of wooden slats, wrapped in white paper, with a red paper label pasted on the front, looking neat and presentable. This was the elder's customary holiday gift, supposedly catering to my fondness for sweets. Feeling grateful, I excitedly opened the box to eat. The piece of inedible paper stuck to the bottom of the mooncake was painstakingly removed, making me slightly annoyed. Unexpectedly, the half-mooncake I bit into had a thick, burnt, and greasy skin, filled with hardened lumps of cheap sugar, so-called "too sweet to eat, too bad to waste." Ultimately, I couldn't bear the sweetness and secretly went out to vomit. Since then, I have completely lost interest in eating mooncakes during the Mid-Autumn Festival!</p>
<p>Cantonese-style mooncakes are quite different. The size of the cakes varies, but the skin is always soft and glutinous. Unless they have been stored for too long, they also have a hint of sweetness, which is a significant advantage. The fillings also come in many varieties, all made with careful preparation and considered well-matched. In recent years, Cantonese mooncakes have been promoted almost nationwide and have successfully invaded the mooncake market in the Jiangzhe region, occupying a large portion of the local products' market share. This shows that even with leisure foods, which seem trivial, one must still research and seek improvement. If one remains stuck in the old methods of centuries ago, superior products will naturally rise to replace them. Like local mooncakes, even if they are not squeezed to the point of being lost, they will likely disappoint the festival and be lamented by connoisseurs!</p>
<p>Cantonese mooncake shops, like other mooncake shops, begin production and sales from the beginning of the seventh lunar month. Each shop utilizes its expertise to innovate and introduce new products, bestowing auspicious names and even creating special price lists, treating it as a serious matter. With shared tastes, the shops with better products are often swamped with customers. For example, the three major companies in Shanghai temporarily suspend the production of Western pastries to focus all their efforts on making Cantonese mooncakes. This period of business is undoubtedly dedicated to providing food. But why do all the shops in the city stop selling Cantonese mooncakes as soon as the Mid-Autumn Festival is over? I think the many gourmets in the city certainly won't act in unison and stop eating Cantonese mooncakes because they are out of season. I wonder if there is any special reason for this. I'll have to ask Mr. Xi, the owner of Guanshengyuan, when I see him.</p>

<p>Commercial News: Financial and Gold Markets Still Oppressed by Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>Continued decline of 6.9 yuan, breaking the 40-yuan mark</p>
<p>The gold market, with few short positions and a relatively stable front, but under the pressure of loose and excessive supply, continued to fall due to hedging sales. Initially, the overseas silver market saw a rise in both London and New York, and there was talk of the United States tending to buy after the close, which dampened market sentiment. Although London gold rose by two pence, exchange rates continued to decline. American cotton fell by sixteen pounds sterling, American wheat shrank by 8.75, and stocks rose by a weak two yuan. Off-exchange trading retreated to around five yuan. After the market opened, it felt calm, but as exchange rates declined, the Shanghai market saw a loosening of British exchange. The top secret HSBC Bank British and American exchange rates both rose by 1.25. Sellers took advantage of the momentum to sell, causing a decline. However, because many banks were still counter-trading, the American exchange rate temporarily stabilized and rebounded somewhat, hovering around four yuan. Nevertheless, with the multi-short positions being very close, sellers were constantly active, and with the loosening of the exchange market, there was also hedging liquidation, making the trend of rising difficult and falling easy very obvious. Market prices then became unsustainable. At this point, the December futures new standard reached a low of 2.8 yuan. Many who bought December futures began to liquidate. Sentiment among holders of November futures fluctuated, and the decline continued. American exchange forward rates loosened to over 36 yuan, causing buyers to retreat. The off-exchange market then opened flat. Subsequently, sales by the Dalian gang and Yuanxing caused a retreat to within 40 yuan. Purchases by Ruixing and others brought it back to roughly even. After opening, the market rose due to strong buying demand, but it was still hindered by the loose exchange market. The Bombay market rose by 2.3.3 anna, but still retreated within the 40-yuan mark. Although there were large players buying strongly, it was mostly for intraday trading. Later, after the Central Bank continuously opened positions at low prices, sentiment gradually stabilized, and the market was able to rebound. Finally, the Bombay market telegraphed that the second report showed a rise of one anna, no change, and a decline of one anna. The market situation remained calm, with supply and demand in equilibrium and lacking change. December futures new standards also declined at the same time, but because London pure gold rose by two pence, the local exchange market was strong. However, pure gold was expected to rise, and the general sentiment tended towards hedging out November futures. This was because, after the American government released new bonds, rumors of inflation in the market grew stronger. The new standard was less affected, so the market situation for the day was stronger than that of November, and the result was even higher than that of November. There were no special telegrams throughout the day. Four new brokers entered the market. The market situation for the day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 945 yuan, down 2.6 yuan from the previous close. The exchange market opened with a recent selling price of 1 shilling, 5 pence, 125 for British exchange and 35.75 yuan for American exchange. Qing Yu Fu Yu Yuan Feng Yong Shun Mao Shang Jin opened steadily, but because Fu Chang Yuan Mao Yong Fu Xing Yong Yuan Xing Yong Feng and others were eager to sell, they learned that HSBC Bank British and American exchange rates were listed, each rising by 1.25, and retreated to 3.7 yuan. Dacheng Heng Yu advanced to 455.5 corner. After Macalister came out with American gold for November, there were still sellers for American gold at 8.125 in October. Heng Yu Dade Cheng Yongli sold to 3.6 yuan. Fu Yu and others took advantage of the low to pay, gradually recovering. Later, Datong, though blocked American gold for October at 8.125, colleagues wanted to pull American gold for November at 8.75 but failed, rising to 4.9 yuan. Later, Mitsui came out with American gold for October at 8.125, HSBC blocked American gold for November at 8.75, Dalian Du Zhaofeng Chang Yuan Sheng Yong Rui Kang sold within the four horrors, but still hovering. When Datong finally blocked American gold for October at 8.75, Yu Qing Yong Tian Cheng Da Xing Yong Yuan Mao Yong Yuan Kang Xiang Rui Kang Tong Yi An Shen Heng Tai and others jointly sold, and then fell to 1.3 yuan. Yuan Mao Yong Da Fa Yong still had a buying appetite, and rose to about 2 yuan. After entering, the overall situation hovered. After Tian Feng Fu Xing Yong offered, the noon closing was 941.6 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon opening was 93 yuan and 9 corner. Heng Xing Yong Feng Shun Mao Dade Cheng Yu Qing Yong Hui Xiang and others all advanced, rising to 41 yuan. The Bombay telegram reported a rise of 2.3.3 anna. Zhaofeng Chang Tian Feng Rui Kang Ding Tai sold, and then fell to 39.8 corner. Yu Qing Yong Da Bei Cheng Qian Chang Xiang Shun changed Ying Feng Heng Jin, the Central Bank opened positions, rising to 0.7 corner. Macalister blocked British gold at 25 in November, Yue Xing Heng Yu bought, and then fell to 39.4 corner. The Central Bank continued to open positions, Fu Chang Dade Cheng Qian Chang Xiang Shun Mao Yuan Chun Guang Feng Chang and others entered, and then rebounded to 41.3 corner. Xiang He Fu Xing Yong Hong Xing sold and retreated to 0.8 corner. Chun Yuan Yong Xiong Yuan Mao Yong Shang advanced, the Bombay drop was minimal, rising to 1.2 corner. Yi Yu sold, and then retreated to 0.6 corner. Yuan Yi Fu Yu Yuan Xing advanced and were still stable. After struggling, the closing was 940.7 yuan. After the close, though Bing Xing sold, the market situation was calm. The highest price of the day was 945.5 yuan, the lowest price was 939.4 corner, a total rise and fall of 6.1 yuan. As a result, it continued to fall by 6.9 yuan from the previous close.</p>
<p>The morning opening for the December futures new standard was 945 yuan, down 2.6 yuan from the previous close. It then rose to 5.5 yuan.

<p>Financial Outlook: Seemingly Quiet</p>
<p>Interbank lending rate slightly fell, clearing houses still operating</p>
<p>Although the financial background seems extraordinarily exhausted, as seen in the Bund mortgage crisis a few days ago, even harsh conditions were being refused. Fortunately, there are many individuals in the financial sector who are dedicated to public service and understand that without mutual solidarity, the financial system will inevitably collapse. Therefore, on one hand, they are joining hands, and on the other hand, they are trying their best to lower the interbank lending rate to calm the market. Yesterday, the market even fell by two cents. Both the early and noon markets were at 1.3 cents, while the clearing house rate remained at 2 cents, not speculating even as the Mid-Autumn Festival approached. This is a good sign for our financial sector and is also something readers will be happy to hear. Discounted bill transactions: Over 3.9 million in early market transfers and new transactions, over 400,000 in noon market transactions, over 300,000 in small general association transactions, over 900,000 in foreign mortgage transactions, and over 1.5 million in new deals. Bank settlements were busier than before due to the comparison period. Foreign banks settled over 2.6 million in bill settlements, over 3.7 million in various exchange goods and collateral settlements, over 500,000 in telegraphic transfer settlements, and 700,000 in withdrawals. Chinese banks settled over 3.7 million in bill settlements, over 4.2 million in various exchange goods and collateral settlements, over 800,000 in telegraphic transfer settlements, over 600,000 in customs duty settlements, over 800,000 in foreign exchange settlements, and 400,000 in withdrawals. Japanese banks settled over 1.9 million in bill settlements, over 3.8 million in various exchange goods and collateral settlements, over 500,000 in foreign exchange settlements, and 200,000 in deposits.

<p>Finish Line Changed to Shen Garden</p>
<p>In order to promote and popularize walking skills, the Chinese Walking Association, in addition to participating in the annual International Walking Competition, has launched the Shanghai Open Walking Competition for men and women. With the assistance of the Sports Advancement Association since the 20th year, it has been held annually for four sessions. This year's competition, after being decided by the association's committee in April, is scheduled to be held on November 4th. The men's race is 13 miles, and the women's race has been increased to two miles. The finish line was originally set at the Chinese Athletics Field on Route Père Robert, but now that the field has been converted into a hospital and the Sports Association has moved to Shen Garden on Yanping Road, the route has also been changed accordingly (see route below). The entire route is thirteen and one-third miles long. The women's race will be held inside the athletics field, running eight laps around the track, a total of 3,200 meters. Training will begin soon. Those who are unfamiliar with the correct posture can join the training class at the association's location at the Moore Memorial Church on Xizang Road. Women can write to the association to request guidance. It is reported that the association will start accepting registrations next month (October). The route is as follows: starting from the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Tongfu Road, via Great Western Road, Brennan Road, turning into Warren Road, Hongqiao Road, straight into Yaoyan Jiao Road, Avenue Petain, Avenue Joffre, Avenue du Roi Albert, Seymour Road, to Xinzha Road, passing Ba Xia Sha Du Road, Connaught Road, Yanping Road, and ending inside the Shen Garden Athletics Field.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that the association has scheduled a 17-mile walking practice this Sunday (the 23rd) at 7:00 AM. Those who wish to join must first register with the association and gather at the intersection of Tongfu Road on that day, departing on time. It is heard that the veteran 石金生 (Shi Jinsheng), who retired last year, has regained his momentum this year and is training with 周余愚 (Zhou Yuyu) and others for the 50,000-meter race. It can be predicted that he will achieve excellent results in the future.</p>
